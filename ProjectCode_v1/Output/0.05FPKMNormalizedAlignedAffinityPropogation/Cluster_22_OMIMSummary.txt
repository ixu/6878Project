614642	TITLE *614642 START DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 9; STARD9
;;KIAA1300
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

STARD9 belongs to the kinesin-3 family of ATPases (see KIF1A; 601255)
involved in transporting vesicles and organelles (Torres et al., 2011).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned STARD9, which they designated
KIAA1300. The deduced protein contains 1,820 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA
detected highest STARD9 expression in adult lung. Moderate expression
was detected in all other adult and fetal tissues and adult brain
regions examined except skeletal muscle, which showed low STARD9
expression.

Halama et al. (2006) determined that the 1,820-amino acid STARD9 protein
contains a START lipid-binding domain. By database analysis, they
identified a STARD9 splice variant lacking exon 8. Database analysis
revealed STARD9 orthologs in mammals, chicken, and pufferfish.

By characterizing proteins that copurified with polymerized microtubule
asters and that were required for mitotic progression in HeLa cells,
Torres et al. (2011) identified STARD9. The deduced full-length protein
contains 4,614 amino acids and has a calculated molecular mass of 506.7
kD. The N terminus of full-length STARD9 has a motor domain and an FHA
domain, and the C terminus has a coiled-coil region and a START domain.
The motor domain of STARD9 shares highest similarity with the motor
domains of KIF16B and KIF1A. Torres et al. (2011) identified 2
additional isoforms of STARD9. One, a 323-amino acid protein, lacks 84
N-terminal amino acids of full-length STARD9 that are essential for
ATPase activity. The other, a 292-amino acid protein, is nearly
identical to the N-terminal end of full-length STARD9, but it lacks part
of the motor domain. Torres et al. (2011) found that STARD9 was
expressed at low levels in all tissues examined. Immunohistochemical
analysis of HeLa cells detected STARD9 throughout the nucleus and
cytoplasm in interphase and localized to daughter centrioles from
prophase to late anaphase. STARD9 was not detected during cytokinesis.
Orthologs of STARD9 were found in vertebrates only.

GENE FUNCTION

Torres et al. (2011) found that the isolated motor domain of STARD9
showed ATPase activity and bound microtubules. Mutation analysis
revealed a critical role for thr110 in STARD9 ATPase activity and for
arg223 within the switch-1 region in STARD9 microtubule binding. Both
residues were involved in localization of the motor domain to
centrosomes. Knockdown of STARD9 in HeLa cells via small interfering RNA
led to fragmentation and dissociation of the pericentriolar material,
multipolar spindles, activation of the spindle assembly checkpoint,
mitotic arrest, and apoptosis. Overexpression of the STARD9 motor domain
partially rescued fragmentation of pericentriolar material following
STARD9 depletion. Knockdown of STARD9 had little effect on mitotic
progression or apoptosis in normal cells and in a significant subset of
tumor cell lines. Chemical inhibition of the mitotic regulators CDK1
(116940), PLK1 (602098), and kinesin-5 (KIF11; 602821) and
nocodazole-dependent depolymerization of microtubules reduced
fragmentation of pericentriolar material in STARD9-knockdown cells.
Nocodazole also eliminated localization of STARD9 to centrioles. Torres
et al. (2011) hypothesized that STARD9 stabilizes pericentriolar
material under microtubule-mediated tension during bipolar spindle
assembly and may form a link between the daughter centriole and
pericentriolar material.

GENE STRUCTURE

Halama et al. (2006) determined that the STARD9 gene contains 11 exons.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (2000) mapped the STARD9
gene to chromosome 15. Halama et al. (2006) mapped the STARD9 gene to
chromosome 15q15 by genomic sequence analysis.

180410	TITLE *180410 RIBONUCLEOTIDE REDUCTASE, M1 SUBUNIT; RRM1
;;RIBONUCLEOTIDE REDUCTASE, LARGE SUBUNIT;;
RIBONUCLEOTIDE REDUCTASE, R1 SUBUNIT; R1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The RRM1 gene encodes the large subunit (R1) of ribonucleotide
reductase, the heterodimeric enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting
step in deoxyribonucleotide synthesis.

CLONING

Pavloff et al. (1992) cloned human RRM1 and RRM2 (180390) cDNAs from a
breast carcinoma cDNA library. The deduced 792-amino acid RRM1 protein
has a molecular mass of 90 kD and shares about 98% sequence homology
with the mouse Rrm1 protein.

MAPPING

By immunoblotting of somatic cell hybrid extracts, Engstrom and Francke
(1985) mapped the gene for the R1 subunit of ribonucleotide reductase to
11pter-p11. This assignment was confirmed by Southern analysis of hybrid
cell DNAs, and the RRM1 locus was sublocalized to the distal band 11p15
by in situ hybridization (Brissenden et al., 1988).

Byrne and Smith (1991) identified a RFLP at the RRM1 locus, which is
useful in the mapping of 11p.

GENE STRUCTURE

Parker et al. (1994) used a fragment of human RRM1 cDNA to isolate a
genomic clone that encompassed the 5-prime flanking region of RRM1.
Primer extension and PCR experiments defined 6 potential cap sites.

Parker et al. (1995) characterized the TATA-less promoter region of the
human RRM1 gene and found 2 domains that were conserved with respect to
the mouse sequence. One of these sequences was shown to bind the
transcription factor SP1 (189906).

Pitterle et al. (1999) demonstrated that the RRM1 gene contains 19
exons, spans over 45 kb, and is oriented from telomere to centromere
with exon 19 nearest to D11S12.

GENE FUNCTION

In dividing cells, ribonucleotide reductase is essential for the
production of deoxyribonucleotides before DNA synthesis in S phase.
Neither of its 2 subunits, R1 or R2 (180390), are detectable in
quiescent cells. In cycling cells, RRM1 mRNA and protein are present
throughout the cell cycle (summary by Parker et al., 1994).

Byrne and Smith (1993) found that the RRM1 gene, which is located at
11p15.5, is not imprinted in Wilms tumor or in hepatoblastoma. They
demonstrated transcription of both alleles in 6 Wilms tumors, 1
hepatoblastoma, and samples from adjacent kidney and liver from
individuals who were constitutionally heterozygous for a TaqI
polymorphism.

Because the RRM1 gene is located in a region of loss of heterozygosity
(LOH) in lung tumors, Pitterle et al. (1999) screened all 19 RRM1 exons
in 12 pairs of normal and tumor DNA samples and identified no mutations.

604688	TITLE *604688 A-KINASE ANCHOR PROTEIN 5; AKAP5
;;A-KINASE ANCHOR PROTEIN, 79-KD; AKAP79;;
AKAP75, BOVINE, HOMOLOG OF;;
AKAP150, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

A-kinase anchor proteins (AKAPs), such as AKAP5, ensure the fidelity of
second messenger signaling events by directing protein kinases and
phosphatases toward their preferred substrates. AKAP5 brings protein
kinase A (PKA; see 176911), the calcium/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase
PP2B (see 114105), and protein kinase C (PKC; see 176960) to
postsynaptic membranes, where they facilitate phosphorylation-dependent
modulation of ion channels (summary by Tunquist et al., 2008).

CLONING

By screening a human thyroid cDNA library for PKA type II regulatory
(RII) subunit anchoring proteins, Carr et al. (1991) isolated a cDNA
encoding a novel member of the AKAP family, AKAP5, which the authors
designated H21. The deduced AKAP5 protein contains 427 amino acids with
an amphipathic helix of 14 amino acids that is the critical secondary
structure for RII binding.

Using immunohistochemical analysis, Tunquist et al. (2008) found that
the mouse homolog of AKAP5, Akap150, was expressed in several
hippocampal structures, including CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus. In
cultured hippocampal neurons, Akap150 was concentrated in dendrites and
spines.

GENE FUNCTION

Using binding studies of human AKAP79 and its bovine homolog, Akap75, to
RII-beta, Hirsch et al. (1992) determined that these proteins are
associated with particulate intracellular structures. Helical wheel
analysis revealed the potential for an amphipathic helix within the
N-terminal 179 amino acids.

By Western blot analysis, Carr et al. (1992) demonstrated that AKAP5 is
predominantly expressed in cerebral cortex and is a component of
fractions enriched for postsynaptic densities (PSD) where RII PKA
colocalizes. Mutation analysis demonstrated that substitution of proline
at a number of positions in the amphipathic helix but not elsewhere in
the protein disrupted RII binding. The authors suggested that AKAP5 may
anchor RII PKA at PSD and be involved in the regulation of postsynaptic
events.

Using an RII overlay assay and confocal microscopy, Schillace et al.
(2002) demonstrated AKAP5 expression in T lymphocytes. They suggested
that AKAP5 may function to inhibit interleukin-2 (IL2; 147680)
transcription by disrupting calcineurin (see 114105)-dependent
dephosphorylation of NFAT (see 600489).

Using RII overlay analysis, Williams (2002) identified at least 8 AKAPs
in mouse T cells, including Akap5. Using an inhibitor of AKAP binding to
PKA, the author observed the production of increased levels of Il2
(147680), Il4 (147780), Il5 (147850), and Ifng (147570) production, as
well as T cell proliferation, particularly in the presence of antigen.
Williams (2002) concluded that AKAPs are important in regulating the
activity of T lymphocytes and in determining their sensitivity to
incoming cAMP signals.

M-type potassium channels exert negative control over neuronal
excitability and can be suppressed by G protein-coupled receptors. Hoshi
et al. (2003) showed that Akap150 serves as an anchor for PKC and binds
directly to an intracellular region of the Kcnq2 (602235) M-type
potassium channel subunit. Functional studies showed that Akap150
promoted PKC-induced serine phosphorylation of Kcnq2, which in turn
facilitated the muscarinic receptor-induced suppression of M currents in
rat superior cervical ganglion neurons.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium assigned the AKAP5
gene to chromosome 14q21-q24 (TMAP M90359).

ANIMAL MODEL

Tunquist et al. (2008) obtained Akap150 -/- mice at the expected
frequency. Akap150 -/- brains had no obvious morphologic abnormalities,
and cultured Akap150 -/- hippocampal neurons showed normal morphology
and number of dendritic spines. However, lack of Akap150 perturbed
targeting of the PKA holoenzyme to dendritic spines, with accumulation
of PKA to dendritic shafts. Mislocalization of PKA reduced
phosphorylation of the Glur1 (GRIA1; 138248) subunit of the postsynaptic
AMPA receptor, resulting in pronounced agonist-dependent downregulation
of the receptor and altered synaptic transmission. Compared with
wildtype mice, Akap150 -/- mice showed deficits in spatial memory and
motor coordination and strength, reduced anxiety, and altered muscarinic
agonist-induced seizures.

615094	TITLE *615094 PROSPERO-RELATED HOMEOBOX 2; PROX2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Proteins related to Drosophila prospero, like PROX2, contain an atypical
DNA-binding homeodomain. PROX2 functions as a transcriptional activator
(Nishijima and Ohtoshi, 2006).

CLONING

Nishijima and Ohtoshi (2006) cloned mouse Prox2 from postnatal mouse
retina RNA. The deduced 593-amino acid protein contains an N-terminal
domain conserved in prospero proteins, designated PD1, followed by a
C-terminal homeodomain and a second conserved prospero domain, PD2.
Database analysis revealed orthologs of Prox2 in rat and human. Northern
blot analysis of 12 mouse tissues detected transcripts of about 1.8 and
2.5 kb in testis only. RNA dot blot analysis and in situ hybridization
revealed Prox2 expression in whole mouse embryo, in embryonic cranial
ganglia, and in neonatal retina.

Pistocchi et al. (2008) found that zebrafish Prox2 was expressed
throughout development, including the zygote, and in all adult organs
examined.

GENE FUNCTION

Using reporter gene assays, Nishijima and Ohtoshi (2006) found that
mouse Prox2 was a transcriptional activator. Truncation analysis showed
that the N-terminal 130 amino acids of Prox2, including PD1, were
sufficient for transcriptional activation.

MAPPING

By database analysis, Nishijima and Ohtoshi (2006) mapped the mouse and
human PROX2 genes to regions of conserved synteny on chromosomes 12 and
14, respectively.

Hartz (2013) mapped the PROX2 gene to chromosome 14q24.3 based on an
alignment of the PROX2 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK094068) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

ANIMAL MODEL

Nishijima and Ohtoshi (2006) obtained Prox2 -/- mice at the expected
mendelian ratio. Prox2 -/- mice grew and developed normally, and both
male and female Prox2 -/- mice were fertile.

612871	TITLE *612871 Na+/K+ TRANSPORTING ATPase-INTERACTING 1; NKAIN1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

NKAIN1 is a member of a family of mammalian proteins with similarity to
Drosophila Nkain and interacts with the beta subunit of Na,K-ATPase
(ATP1B1; 182330) (Gorokhova et al., 2007).

CLONING

Using EST database analysis to screen for novel proteins expressed in
the mammalian central nervous system, followed by RT-PCR of mouse brain
RNA, Gorokhova et al. (2007) cloned mouse Nkain1 and identified human
NKAIN1. NKAIN1 contains a predicted cleavable signal peptide and 3
putative transmembrane domains. Mouse Nkain1 shares 60% amino acid
similarity with the first 200 amino acids of the Drosophila ortholog,
which extends for an additional 458 amino acids in a C-terminal tail
absent from mouse Nkain1. RT-PCR analysis detected expression in mouse
brain and testis only. Immunohistochemical studies localized Nkain1 to
the cell membrane when expressed in HEK293T cells, and double-staining
with marker NeuN showed that Nkain1 expression was neuron specific.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid screening of a mouse brain cDNA library using Nkain1 C
terminus as bait, followed by additional 2-hybrid studies and
coimmunoprecipitation, Gorokhova et al. (2007) showed that Nkain1
interacted with the C-terminal 56 amino acids of ATP1B1.
Coimmunoprecipitation studies showed that Nkain1, ATP1B1, and MONAKA
(PXK; 611450) form a complex in transfected HEK293T cells. Nkain1 failed
to induce a Na(+) conductance in Xenopus oocytes, in contrast to the
Drosophila ortholog, which can induce a small but significant
amiloride-insensitive Na(+) conductance when expressed in Xenopus
oocytes.

MAPPING

By database analysis, Gorokhova et al. (2007) mapped the NKAIN1 gene to
chromosome 1p35.2 and the mouse Nkain1 gene to chromosome 4D3.

ANIMAL MODEL

Gorokhova et al. (2007) showed that a Drosophila mutant carrying a
P-element insertion in the first exon of Nkain displayed a
temperature-sensitive phenotype characterized by development of
decreased coordination, seizure-like movements, and paralysis when
placed at 38 degrees C.

601655	TITLE *601655 EYES ABSENT 3; EYA3
;;EYES ABSENT, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, 3
DESCRIPTION Abdelhak et al. (1997) identified 3 members of a novel family homologous
to Drosophila 'eyes absent' gene (eya). One of these, EYA1 (601653), was
demonstrated to be mutant in cases of branchiootorenal dysplasia (BOR;
113650). EYA2 (601654) and EYA3, like EYA1, are expressed in the ninth
week of human development and may also underlie developmental defects.

Xu et al. (1997) showed that in the limbs of 10.5-day mouse embryos,
Eya1 expression was largely restricted to the flexor tendons, whereas
Eya2 was expressed in the extensor tendons and probably also in the
ligments of the phalanges. They demonstrated that the
proline/serine/threonine-rich N-terminal regions of the protein products
of the Eya1, Eya2, and Eya3 genes have transcriptional activator
activity. These results supported a role for the Eya genes in connective
tissue patterning in the limbs.

Zimmerman et al. (1997) mapped the murine Eya3 gene to mouse chromosome
4 in the region syntenic with human 1p36. In the mouse, no recombination
was detected between the Eya3 gene and the gene encoding the oncogene
FGR (164940) which is located on 1p36.2-p36.1. By fluorescence in situ
hybridization, Zimmerman et al. (1997) established that the human EYA3
gene is on 1p36.

610922	TITLE *610922 NUCLEAR PORE ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 1; NPAP1
;;CHROMOSOME 15 OPEN READING FRAME 2; C15ORF2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing YAC clones containing a CpG island in the Prader-Willi
syndrome (PWS; 176270) critical region on chromosome 15, followed by
database analysis and PCR and 3-prime RACE of a human testis cDNA
library, Farber et al. (2000) cloned C15ORF2. The deduced protein
contains 1,156 amino acids. Northern blot analysis detected a 7.5-kb
transcript in adult testis, but not in fetal testis or in any other
adult or fetal tissues examined. Southern blot analysis detected C15ORF2
in several primates, but not in any other mammalian or avian species
examined. The primate sequences share between 97 and 99% identities.

GENE FUNCTION

Farber et al. (2000) found that a CpG island associated with C15ORF2 was
methylated in all tissues tested except for germ cells. Although C15ORF2
maps between the imprinted genes MAGEL2 (605283) and SNRPN (182279),
they demonstrated that C15ORF2 was biallelically expressed in adult
testis.

Buiting et al. (2007) found that C15ORF2 was monoallelically expressed
in fetal brain.

GENE STRUCTURE

Farber et al. (2000) determined that C15ORF2 is an intronless gene with
its start codon imbedded within a CpG island.

;;CHROMOSOME 1 OPEN READING FRAME 13; C1ORF13;;
DIHYDRODIPICOLINATE SYNTHASE;;
C112
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

N-acetylneuraminate pyruvate lyase (EC 4.1.3.3) controls the cellular
concentration of sialic acid by catalyzing the conversion of sialic acid
into acylmannosamines and pyruvate (Wu et al., 2005).

CLONING

By searching for genes in a region of chromosome 1 associated with
hereditary prostate cancer (HPC1; 601518), followed by screening cDNA
libraries, Sood et al. (2001) cloned NPL, which they called C112. The
deduced protein contains 320 amino acids. Northern blot analysis
detected weak expression of a 5-kb transcript in all human tissues
examined.

By large-scale sequence analysis of clones obtained from a fetal brain
cDNA library, Wu et al. (2005) cloned a splice variant of NPL. The
deduced 301-amino acid splice variant, which they called NPLV2, contains
an N-terminal dihydrodipicolinate synthase (DHDPS) domain and 5 putative
N-terminal phosphorylation sites. RT-PCR detected highest expression in
liver, kidney, and peripheral blood leukocytes, and lower expression in
placenta, pancreas, spleen, thymus, ovary, and small intestine. By
database analysis, Wu et al. (2005) identified 3 other NPL splice
variants.

GENE STRUCTURE

Wu et al. (2005) determined that the NPL gene contains 11 exons and
spans over 40 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Sood et al. (2001) mapped the NPL gene to
chromosome 1q25.

;;MO25-ALPHA
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching databases using peptide fragments of proteins that
interacted with the serine/threonine protein kinase LKB1 (STK11; 602216)
in HeLa cells, Boudeau et al. (2003) identified CAB39, which they
designated MO25-alpha. The deduced 341-amino acid protein shares a high
degree of conservation with its C. elegans and Drosophila orthologs.
Northern blot analysis detected a 4.2-kb MO25-alpha transcript in all
tissues examined, with highest expression in skeletal muscle. Western
blot analysis detected MO25-alpha in most tissues and cell lines
examined. Endogenous MO25-alpha in HeLa cells had an apparent molecular
mass of 40 kD by SDS-PAGE.

GENE FUNCTION

By immunoprecipitation analysis of human and rat cells, Boudeau et al.
(2003) showed that MO25-alpha associated with STRAD-alpha (608626) and
LKB1. Cotransfection and mutation analysis revealed that MO25-alpha
interacted directly with STRAD-alpha rather than with LKB1, and the
interaction required the last 3 residues of STRAD-alpha. MO25-alpha also
interacted with STRAD-beta (ALS2CR2; 607333) in a complex with LKB1.
MO25-alpha and STRAD-alpha anchored LKB1 in the cytoplasm, excluding it
from the nucleus. Moreover, MO25-alpha enhanced formation of
LKB1-STRAD-alpha complexes in vivo and stimulated LKB1 catalytic
activity about 10-fold. Boudeau et al. (2003) concluded that MO25-alpha
may function as a scaffolding component of the LKB1-STRAD complex and
regulate LKB1 activity and cellular localization.

Using mutagenesis, Boudeau et al. (2004) identified 2 binding sites on
opposite surfaces of MO25-alpha that were required for assembly of the
MO25-alpha-STRAD-alpha-LKB1 complex.

Denning et al. (2012) identified a mechanism of cell extrusion that is
caspase-independent and that can eliminate a subset of the C. elegans
cells programmed to die during embryonic development. In wildtype
animals, these cells die soon after their generation through
caspase-mediated apoptosis. However, in mutants lacking all 4 C. elegans
caspase genes, these cells were eliminated by being extruded from the
developing embryo into the extraembryonic space of the egg. The shed
cells showed apoptosis-like cytologic and morphologic characteristics,
indicating that apoptosis can occur in the absence of caspases in C.
elegans. Denning et al. (2012) described a kinase pathway required for
cell extrusion involving Par4, Strd1, and Mop25.1/25.2, the C. elegans
homologs of the mammalian tumor suppressor kinase LKB1 (602216) and its
binding partners STRAD-alpha (608626) and MO25-alpha. The AMPK-related
kinase Pig1, a possible target of the Par4-Strd1-Mop25 kinase complex,
is also required for cell shedding. Pig1 promotes shed cell detachment
by preventing the cell surface expression of cell adhesion molecules.
Denning et al. (2012) concluded that their findings revealed a mechanism
for apoptotic cell elimination that is fundamentally distinct from that
of canonical programmed cell death.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Zeqiraj et al. (2009) described the structure of the core heterotrimeric
LKB1-STRAD-alpha-MO25-alpha complex, revealing an unusual allosteric
mechanism of LKB1 activation. STRAD-alpha adopts a closed conformation
typical of active protein kinases and binds LKB1 as a pseudosubstrate.
STRAD-alpha and MO25-alpha promote the active conformation of LKB1,
which is stabilized by MO25-alpha interacting with the LKB1 activation
loop. Zeqiraj et al. (2009) suggested that this previously undescribed
mechanism of kinase activation may be relevant to understanding the
evolution of other pseudokinases, and also commented that the structure
reveals how mutations found in Peutz-Jeghers (175200) syndrome and in
various sporadic cancers impair LKB1 function.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the CAB39
gene to chromosome 2 (TMAP RH94102).

;;FLVCR-LIKE ON CHROMOSOME 14q; FLVCRL14q;;
CALCIUM CHELATE TRANSPORTER; CCT;;
CHROMOSOME 14 OPEN READING FRAME 58; C14ORF58
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The FLVCR2 gene encodes a transmembrane protein that belongs to the
major facilitator superfamily of secondary carriers that transport small
solutes in response to chemiosmotic ion gradients, such as calcium
(summary by Meyer et al., 2010).

CLONING

By searching databases for sequences similar to FLVCR1 (609144),
Lipovich et al. (2002) identified FLVCR2, which they called FLVCRL14q.
The deduced 527-amino acid protein contains 12 transmembrane domains and
the N- and C-terminal domains are cytoplasmic. A splice variant, in
which exon 1 is directly spliced to exon 9, encodes a putative 83-amino
acid protein that lacks all transmembrane domains.

Brasier et al. (2004) used a rat cDNA for a calcitonin (114130)-like
receptor to design 5-prime and 3-prime RACE primers, and they cloned 4
CCT transcripts from a human pituitary cDNA library. All transcripts
encode a deduced 526-amino acid protein that has an N-terminal hexad
repeat, 6 extracellular loops, and a C-terminal polyglutamate sequence.
EST analysis detected CCT in brain, heart, kidney, lung, placenta,
uterus, cervix, prostate, testis, germ cells, and whole fetus.
Immunofluorescence analysis of human pituitary detected CCT
predominantly in acidophils. Brasier et al. (2004) also identified 3 Cct
transcripts in mouse, which encode a deduced 551-amino acid protein. In
developing rat, Cct expression was restricted to osteoclasts,
chondrocytes, thyroid, pituitary, central nervous system, eye, liver,
kidney, and heart, and in mouse, intraplacental yolk sac showed Cct
expression. In mouse and rat kidney, Cct was expressed in the distal
portions of nephrons and collecting ducts.

By searching a database for sequences similar to FLVCR1, followed by PCR
of a rhabdomyosarcoma cell line cDNA library, Brown et al. (2006) cloned
FLVCR2, which encodes a protein with a calculated molecular mass of 60
kD. It has 3 potential N-glycosylation motifs. Western blot analysis
detected FLVCR2 proteins at 55 kD and 40 kD. However, N-glycosidase
treatment did not alter the molecular mass of the larger protein.

Using quantitative real-time PCR, Duffy et al. (2010) detected variable
FLVCR2 expression in all human tissues examined, with highest expression
in placenta, followed by adult and fetal liver.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lipovich et al. (2002) determined that the FLVCR2 gene contains 10
exons. The transcription start site is within a predicted CpG island,
and there are 2 polyadenylation signals at the 3-prime end.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Brasier et al. (2004) mapped the FLVCR2
gene to chromosome 14q24.3. They mapped the mouse Flvcr2 gene to
chromosome 12.

EVOLUTION

Lipovich et al. (2002) identified genes, including the FLVCR1-FLVCR2
paralogs, involved in a chromosome 1q/14q block duplication.
Phylogenetic analysis suggested that the duplication occurred early
within or immediately prior to the divergence of the vertebrate lineage,
between the protostome-deuterostome and amniote-amphibian divergences.

GENE FUNCTION

Infection of cells by the highly anemogenic feline leukemia virus
subgroup C (FeLV-C) is mediated by the binding of FeLV-C envelope
protein to FLVCR1. By assaying transfected mouse cells, Brown et al.
(2006) determined that, unlike FLVCR1, FLVCR2 does not bind FeLV-C
envelope protein. However, an asn463-to-asp mutation rendered FLVCR2
functional as an FeLV-C receptor.

Duffy et al. (2010) found that both human FLVCR1 and FLVCR2 bound
immobilized heme. Using hamster or human cell lines and Xenopus oocytes,
they confirmed that overexpression of human FLVCR1 resulted in heme
export, but in contrast, overexpression of FLVCR2 resulted in heme
import. Overexpression of FLVCR2 also rendered transfected cells more
sensitive to heme toxicity. Downregulation of FLVCR2 via small
interfering RNA inhibited heme import. Duffy et al. (2010) concluded
that FLVCR2 functions in heme import.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

By genomewide linkage analysis, followed by candidate gene sequencing,
Meyer et al. (2010) identified a homozygous mutation in the FLVCR2 gene
(T430R; 610865.0001) in 5 fetuses with proliferative vasculopathy and
hydranencephaly-hydrocephaly syndrome (PVHH; 225790) from 3
consanguineous Pakistani families. The disorder is also known as Fowler
syndrome. Two additional fetuses of Northern European origin with the
disorder were each found to be compound heterozygous for 2 mutations in
the FLVCR2 gene (610865.0002-610865.0005). Meyer et al. (2010) suggested
that the disorder may involve defects in proliferation and motility of
vascular endothelial cells in the brain, which are calcium-dependent
events.

Using exome sequencing, Lalonde et al. (2010) identified compound
heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the FLVCR2 gene (610865.0006 and
610865.0007) in a fetus with proliferative vasculopathy and
hydranencephaly-hydrocephaly syndrome.

By genomewide linkage analysis followed by high-throughput sequencing of
7 families with Fowler syndrome, Thomas et al. (2010) identified
homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations affecting the FLVCR2 gene
(see, e.g., Y134X; 610865.0008). Two of the families, of Turkish origin,
carried a large deletion. The patients and families had previously been
reported by Bessieres-Grattagliano et al. (2009).

consanguineous Pakistani families, Meyer et al. (2010) identified a
homozygous 1289C-G transversion in exon 7 of the FLVCR2 gene, resulting
in a thr430-to-arg (T430R) substitution in a highly conserved region in

In a fetus of Northern European origin with proliferative vasculopathy

identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the FLVCR2 gene: a
6-bp deletion (329_334del) in exon 1, and a 1192C-G transversion in exon
6, resulting in a leu398-to-val (L398V; 610865.0003) substitution. The
6-bp deletion removed 3 conserved amino acids (asn110 to phe 112) and
introduced an isoleucine residue in the predicted first extracellular
loop (Asn110_Phe112delinsIle). The L398V substitution occurred in a
highly conserved residue in close proximity to transmembrane domain-9
(TM9). Neither mutation was found in at least 936 control chromosomes.
Lalonde et al. (2010) identified the same compound heterozygous
mutations in a second affected fetus from the family reported by Meyer
et al. (2010).

In a fetus, born of French Canadian parents, with proliferative

et al. (2010) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the
FLVCR2 gene: a 997C-T transition in exon 4, resulting in an
ala326-to-val (A326V) substitution at the end of the sixth transmembrane
domain (TM6), and a T-to-C transition in intron 7 (1341+2T-C;
610865.0007), predicted to result in the skipping of exon 7 or retention
of intron 7, disrupting the tenth transmembrane domain (TM10) and
potentially resulting in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. The parents had
previously lost a fetus with a similar phenotype, but no DNA sample was
available for study.

604481	TITLE *604481 SIRTUIN 3; SIRT3
;;SIR2, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG-LIKE 3; SIR2L3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The sirtuin family of NAD(+)-dependent deacetylases and
mono-ADP-ribosyltransferases control a variety of cellular processes,
such as aging, metabolism, and gene silencing. SIRT3 functions as a
mitochondrial deacetylase (summary by Lombard et al., 2007).

CLONING

The yeast Sir2 (silent information regulator 2) protein (Shore et al.,
1984) regulates epigenetic gene silencing and, as a possible antiaging
effect, suppresses recombination of rDNA. Studies involving cobB, a
bacterial Sir2-like gene, have suggested that Sir2 may encode a pyridine
nucleotide transferase. By in silico and PCR cloning techniques, Frye
(1999) obtained cDNA sequences encoding 5 human Sir2-like genes, which
they called sirtuin-1 to -5 (SIRT1 to SIRT5). The SIRT1 (604479)
sequence has the closest homology to the S. cerevisiae Sir2 protein,
while SIRT4 (604482) and SIRT5 (604483) more closely resemble
prokaryotic sirtuin sequences. PCR analysis showed that the 5 human
sirtuins are widely expressed in fetal and adult tissues.

By PCR of a human spleen cDNA library, Schwer et al. (2002) cloned
SIRT3. The deduced 399-amino acid protein contains an N-terminal
mitochondrial targeting signal and a central catalytic domain.
Fluorescence-tagged SIRT3 localized to mitochondria of transfected HeLa
cells. Western blot analysis of human embryonic kidney cells detected
endogenous SIRT3 peptides of about 44 and 28 kD.

Using immunofluorescence analysis, Scher et al. (2007) showed that
full-length SIRT3 localized to both HeLa cell nuclei and mitochondria.

By Western blot analysis of mouse tissues, Lombard et al. (2007) found
that Sirt3 was highly expressed in mitochondria-rich tissues: brain,
heart, liver, and brown adipose tissue. Subcellular fractionation
revealed that Sirt3 localized to mitochondria.

GENE FUNCTION

Tanny et al. (1999) showed that the yeast Sir2 protein can transfer
labeled phosphate from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide to itself and
histones in vitro. A modified form of Sir2, which results from its
automodification activity, was specifically recognized by
anti-mono-ADP-ribose antibodies, suggesting that Sir2 is an
ADP-ribosyltransferase. Mutation of a phylogenetically invariant
histidine (his364 to tyr) in Sir2 abolished both its enzymatic activity
in vitro and its silencing functions in vivo. However, the mutant
protein was associated with chromatin and other silencing factors in a
manner similar to wildtype Sir2. These findings suggested that Sir2
contains an ADP-ribosyltransferase activity that is essential for its
silencing function.

Although the SIRT3 gene, located in a large imprinted gene domain on
11p15.5, is not imprinted, Onyango et al. (2002) found that it is
localized to mitochondria, with a mitochondrial targeting signal within
a unique N-terminal peptide sequence. The encoded protein was found also
to possess NAD(+)-dependent histone deacetylase activity. These results
suggested a previously unrecognized organelle for sirtuin function and a
role for SIRT3 in mitochondria involving protein deacetylation.

Schwer et al. (2002) assayed endogenous SIRT3 in the mitochondrial
fraction of human embryonic kidney cells and found that it had specific
NAD-dependent deacetylase activity. Mitochondrial import of SIRT3
depended on an N-terminal amphipathic alpha helix rich in basic
residues. SIRT3 was proteolytically processed in the mitochondrial
matrix to a 28-kD product, and this processing was reconstituted in
vitro with recombinant mitochondrial matrix processing peptidase (MPP;
see 603131). Mutation analysis showed that SIRT3 was cleaved between
arg99 and arg100. The unprocessed form of SIRT3 was enzymatically
inactive and became fully activated in vitro after cleavage by MPP.

Scher et al. (2007) showed that both the full-length and processed forms
of SIRT3 had strong NAD(+)-dependent histone deacetylation activity in
vitro, with specificity for lys16 of H4 (see 602822) and, to a lesser
extent, lys9 of H3 (see 602810). SIRT3 could repress transcription of a
target gene in vivo when recruited to its promoter. Full-length SIRT3
was transported from the nucleus to the mitochondria following cell
stresses, such as DNA damage and ultraviolet irradiation, as well as by
SIRT3 overexpression. Transport was inhibited by leptomycin B, a nuclear
export inhibitor.

MAPPING

Frye (1999) stated that the SIRT3 gene is contained within a YAC clone
(GenBank GENBANK AF015416) from the 11p15.5 region.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Bellizzi et al. (2005) identified a variable number of tandem repeats
(VNTR) polymorphism of a 72-bp repeat core in intron 5 of the SIRT3
gene. Alleles differed both in the number of repeats and in the presence
of either a GATA3 (131320) or a delta-EF1 (TCF8; 189909) regulatory
site. Transient transfection experiments demonstrated that the VNTR
region has allele-specific enhancer activity. Bellizzi et al. (2005)
analyzed allele frequencies as a function of age in a sample of 945
individuals between 20 and 106 years of age and found that the allele
completely lacking enhancer activity was virtually absent in males older
than 90 years. The association between VNTR alleles and longevity was
restricted to males, because no difference was observed either in the
genotypic or in the allelic pool between females of younger or older
ages.

ANIMAL MODEL

Lombard et al. (2007) found that Sirt3 -/- mice were born at the
expected mendelian ratio, developed normally, and were indistinguishable
from wildtype. Sirt3 -/- mice were metabolically unremarkable under both
fed and fasted conditions, and they showed normal adaptive
thermogenesis.

Ahn et al. (2008) found that Sirt3 -/- mice appeared indistinguishable
from wildtype mice. However, heart, kidney, and liver of Sirt3 -/- mice,
as well as Sirt3 -/- embryonic fibroblasts, showed reduced basal ATP
levels. In the absence of Sirt3, multiple components of complex I of the
electron transport chain demonstrated increased acetylation.
Mitochondria from Sirt3 -/- mice displayed selective inhibition of
complex I activity, and incubation of exogenous Sirt3 with mutant
mitochondria augmented complex I activity. Ahn et al. (2008) concluded
that SIRT3 regulates and maintains basal ATP levels.

In mice, Hirschey et al. (2010) demonstrated that Sirt3 expression is
upregulated during fasting in liver and brown adipose tissues. During
fasting, livers from mice lacking Sirt3 had higher levels of fatty acid
oxidation intermediate products and triglycerides, associated with
decreased levels of fatty acid oxidation, compared to livers from
wildtype mice. Mass spectrometry of mitochondrial proteins showed that
Lcad (609576) was hyperacetylated at lysine-42 in the absence of Sirt3.
Lcad was deacetylated in wildtype mice under fasted conditions and by
Sirt3 in vitro and in vivo; and hyperacetylation of Lcad reduced its
enzymatic activity. Mice lacking Sirt3 exhibited hallmarks of fatty acid
oxidation disorders during fasting, including reduced ATP levels and
intolerance to cold exposure. Hirschey et al. (2010) concluded that
their findings identified acetylation as a novel regulatory mechanism
for mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation and demonstrated that Sirt3
modulates mitochondrial intermediary metabolism and fatty acid use
during fasting.

Someya et al. (2010) demonstrated that caloric restriction in wildtype
mice reduced oxidative DNA damage in multiple tissues and prevented
age-related hearing loss. In contrast, these phenotypes were not
modified by caloric restriction in Sirt3-null mice. Cellular studies
indicated that SIRT3 directly deacetylated and thus activated isocitrate
dehydrogenase-2 (IDH2; 147650), an enzyme that converts NADP+ to NADPH
in mitochondria. In response to caloric restriction, SIRT3 stimulated
IDH2 activity, leading to increased levels of NADPH and increased levels
of reduced glutathione, which is the major antioxidant defense system in
the cell. Overexpression of SIRT3 and/or IDH2 increased NADPH levels and
protected cultured cells from oxidative stress. The findings provided
conclusive evidence that caloric-mediated reduction of oxidative damage
and prevention of a common age-related phenotype require a member of the
sirtuin family in mammals.

600915	TITLE *600915 NESTIN; NES
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Nestin is an intermediate filament protein that was first identified
with a monoclonal antibody by Hockfield and McKay (1985). It is
expressed predominantly in stem cells of the central nervous system in
the neural tube. Upon terminal neural differentiation, nestin is
downregulated and replaced by neurofilaments.

CLONING

Dahlstrand et al. (1992) cloned the human nestin gene from a genomic DNA
library, using a probe from the rat gene. The human gene encodes a
predicted protein of 1,618 amino acids. The alpha helical domain
demonstrates 82% identity to the rat protein, but other regions of the
sequence are less well conserved. Northern blot analysis of 21-week-old
fetal brain RNA detected a band of approximately 6 kb.

Yang et al. (2001) cloned mouse nestin cDNA, which encodes a deduced
polypeptide that shares 62% sequence identity with the human protein.

GENE FUNCTION

The finding that nestin is expressed in immature skeletal muscle cells
prompted Kobayashi et al. (1998) to study staining patterns of nestin
and desmin (DES; 125660) in rhabdomyosarcomas. They found that nestin
immunoreactivity was present in all of 29 examined typical
rhabdomyosarcomas, which also expressed desmin.

Yang et al. (2001) overexpressed mouse nestin cDNA as an enhanced GFP in
COS-7 cells and found that nestin immunoreactivity was present in the
filamentous cytoskeletal network.

605051	TITLE *605051 CANNABINOID RECEPTOR 2; CNR2
;;CB2 RECEPTOR; CB2;;
CX5
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

In addition to its renowned psychoactive properties, marijuana, or its
major active cannabinoid ingredient, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol,
exerts analgesic, antiinflammatory, immunosuppressive, anticonvulsive,
and antiemetic effects as well as the alleviation of intraocular
pressure in glaucoma. The G protein-coupled cannabinoid receptor-1
(CNR1; 114610), which is expressed in brain but not in the periphery,
apart from low levels in testis, does not readily account for the
nonpsychoactive effects of cannabinoids. Using PCR with degenerate
primers to screen a promyelocytic leukemia cell cDNA library, Munro et
al. (1993) obtained a cDNA encoding CNR2, which the authors called CX5.
Sequence analysis predicted that the deduced 360-amino acid
7-transmembrane-spanning protein has 44% amino acid identity with CNR1
overall and 68% identity with the transmembrane residues proposed to
confer ligand specificity. Binding analysis determined than CNR2 encodes
a high-affinity receptor for cannabinoids, with higher affinity than
CNR1 for cannabinol. Northern blot analysis revealed that the expression
of 2.5- and 5.0-kb transcripts in the HL60 myeloid cell line increases
on myeloid, or granulocyte, differentiation. Using the rat CX5 homolog,
Munro et al. (1993) found that the 2.5-kb transcript is expressed in
spleen but not in brain, kidney, lung, thymus, liver, or nasal
epithelium. In situ hybridization analysis demonstrated expression in
splenic marginal zones. PCR analysis detected CNR2 expression in
purified splenic macrophages but not in CD5+ T cells. Munro et al.
(1993) speculated that the location of CNR2 suggests that its endogenous
ligand should have an immunomodulatory role.

MAPPING

Karsak et al. (2005) stated that the CNR2 gene maps to chromosome 1p36.

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the CNR2
gene to chromosome 1 (TMAP stSG90).

GENE FUNCTION

Van Sickle et al. (2005) reported the expression of CB2 receptor mRNA
and protein localization on brainstem neurons. These functional CB2
receptors in the brainstem were activated by a CB2 receptor agonist,
2-arachidonoylglycerol, and by elevated endogenous levels of
endocannabinoids, which also act at CB1 receptors. Van Sickle et al.
(2005) concluded that CB2 receptors represent an alternative site of
action of endocannabinoids that opens the possibility of nonpsychotropic
therapeutic interventions using enhanced endocannabinoid levels in
localized brain areas.

By real-time RT-PCR of mouse diaphyseal bone marrow-derived stromal
cells, Ofek et al. (2006) found that Cb2 expression progressively
increased during osteoblastic differentiation in parallel with the
expression of osteoblastic marker genes. Immunohistochemical analysis of
distal femoral metaphyseal sections showed Cb2 in osteoblasts,
osteocytes, and osteoclasts. A CB2-specific agonist without psychotropic
effects enhanced endocortical osteoblast number and activity and
restrained trabecular osteoclastogenesis by inhibiting proliferation of
osteoclast precursors and Rankl (602642) expression in bone
marrow-derived osteoblasts/stromal cells. The same agonist attenuated
ovariectomy-induced bone loss and stimulated cortical thickness by
suppressing osteoclast number and stimulating endocortical bone
formation.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

For discussion of a possible association between variation in the CNR2
gene and bone mineral density, see BMND3 (606928).

ANIMAL MODEL

Steffens et al. (2005) investigated the effects of THC in a mouse model
of established atherosclerosis. Oral administration of THC (1 mg/kg(-1)
per day) resulted in significant inhibition of disease progression. This
effective dose is lower than the dose usually associated with
psychotropic effects of THC. Furthermore, Steffens et al. (2005)
detected CB2 receptor (the main cannabinoid receptor expressed on immune
cells) in both human and mouse atherosclerotic plaques. Lymphoid cells
isolated from THC-treated mice showed diminished proliferation capacity
and decreased interferon-gamma (147570) secretion. Macrophage
chemotaxis, which is a crucial step for the development of
atherosclerosis, was also inhibited in vitro by THC. All these effects
were completely blocked by a specific CB2 receptor antagonist. Steffens
et al. (2005) concluded that oral treatment with a low dose of THC
inhibited atherosclerosis progression in the apolipoprotein E (107741)
knockout mouse model, through pleiotropic immunomodulatory effects on
lymphoid and myeloid cells, and that THC or cannabinoids with activity
at the CB2 receptor may be valuable targets for treating
atherosclerosis.

Ofek et al. (2006) found Cb2 -/- mice were healthy, fertile, and of size
and weight indistinguishable from age-matched wildtype controls.
However, both male and female Cb2 -/- mice had low bone mass due to
accelerated age-related trabecular bone loss and cortical expansion,
although cortical thickness remained unaltered. There was also increased
activity of trabecular osteoblasts, increased osteoclast number, and
markedly decreased number of diaphyseal osteoblast precursors. Ofek et
al. (2006) concluded that CB2 is essential for the maintenance of normal
bone mass.

Rousseaux et al. (2007) found that the probiotic bacterial strain
Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM induced a sustained increase of opioid
receptor mu-1 (OPRM1; 600018) and CNR2 mRNA expression in human
intestinal epithelial cells. In vivo experiments in mice and rats
revealed that oral administration of L. bacillus NCFM induced colonic
expression of OPRM1 and CNR2 and, in studies in rats, decreased normal
visceral perception with a 20% increase in the pain threshold as
elicited by colorectal distention. In a rat model of chronic colonic
hypersensitivity that mimics irritable bowel syndrome, oral
administration of NCFM resulted in an antinocioceptive effect of the
same magnitude as that caused by the subcutaneous administration of 1 mg
per kg of morphine. NCFM-induced analgesia was significantly inhibited
by peritoneal administration of a CNR2-selective antagonist but not by
an opioid receptor antagonist. Rousseaux et al. (2007) concluded that
direct contact of NCFM with epithelial cells can induce OPRM1 and CNR2
expression and can contribute to modulation and restoration of the
normal perception of visceral pain.

In an animal model for cutaneous contact hypersensitivity, Karsak et al.
(2007) found that mice lacking both known cannabinoid receptors
displayed exacerbated allergic inflammation. In contrast, fatty acid
amide hydrolase (FAAH; 602935)-deficient mice, which have increased
levels of endocannabinoid anandamide, displayed reduced allergic
responses in the skin. Cannabinoid receptor antagonists exacerbated
allergic inflammation, whereas receptor agonists attenuated
inflammation. Karsak et al. (2007) concluded that their results
demonstrated a protective role of the endocannabinoid system in contact
allergy in the skin and suggested a target for therapeutic intervention.

184755	TITLE *184755 STEROL CARRIER PROTEIN 2; SCP2
;;STEROL CARRIER PROTEIN X; SCPX
DESCRIPTION Sterol carrier protein-2 (SC2) is a peroxisomal enzyme with thiolase
activity that is required for the breakdown of branched-chain fatty
acids (summary by Ferdinandusse et al., 2006).

Sterol carrier protein-2 was the second peroxisomal thiolase to be
identified; see ACAA1 (604054).

CLONING

Yamamoto et al. (1991) used rat SCP2 cDNA to isolate a homologous human
liver SCP2 cDNA. SCP2 encodes a deduced 143-amino acid protein that
shares 89% sequence identity with the rat protein. SCP2 contains a
20-residue N-terminal leader sequence before the mature 13.2-kD
polypeptide, which contains a C-terminal tripeptide related to the
peroxisome targeting sequence. Northern blot analysis identified 2 mRNA
transcripts of 1.8 and 3.2 kb in liver; in fibroblasts and placenta, the
1.8-kb transcript was most abundant.

GENE FUNCTION

Yamamoto et al. (1991) noted that in steroid hormone producing cells
SCP2 is thought to facilitate the transport of cholesterol to
mitochondria, where the first committed step in steroidogenesis takes
place. Yamamoto et al. (1991) demonstrated that coexpression of the SCP2
cDNA with expression vectors for cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme
and adrenodoxin resulted in a 2.5-fold enhancement of progestin
synthesis over that obtained with expression of the steroidogenic enzyme
system alone.

Sterol carrier protein-2 is present in low levels in Zellweger syndrome
(see 214100), in which the cells are deficient in peroxisomes (van
Amerongen et al., 1987).

MAPPING

Yamamoto et al. (1991) used sequences in the 3-prime untranslated region
of the SCP2 cDNA to design PCR primers for use in mapping studies of
human/rodent somatic cell hybrids. In this way, they demonstrated that
the gene is located on the segment 1pter-p21 (He et al., 1991).

Vesa et al. (1994) refined the chromosomal assignment of SCP2 to 1p32 by
analysis of a somatic cell hybrid panel by both PCR and hybridization
methods applied to cell lines with various rearrangements of chromosome
1.

By interspecific backcross analysis, Welch et al. (1996) mapped the Scp2
gene to mouse chromosome 4.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a patient with leukoencephalopathy, dystonia, and motor neuropathy
who was found to have deficiency of SCP2, Ferdinandusse et al. (2006)
identified a homozygous 1-nucleotide insertion (545_546insA;
184755.0001) in the SCP2 gene.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
LEUKOENCEPHALOPATHY WITH DYSTONIA AND MOTOR NEUROPATHY
SCP2, 1-BP INS, 545A

In a man with leukoencephalopathy with dystonia and motor neuropathy
(613724) and his similarly affected brother, Ferdinandusse et al. (2006)
found homozygosity for a 1-bp insertion of an adenine after nucleotide
position 545 (545_546insA) of the SCP2 gene, leading to a frameshift and
premature stop codon (I184fsX7).

;;CYTOCHROME c OXIDASE ASSEMBLY 1-LIKE;;
OXA1-LIKE GENE
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Cytochrome c oxidase is a complex of proteins that is essential for
cellular energy metabolism. It functions by transferring electrons from
reduced cytochrome c to molecular oxygen. Mammalian cytochrome c oxidase
consists of 13 subunits. The 3 largest subunits are encoded by the
mitochondrial genome while the remainder are produced by nuclear genes
and imported into the mitochondria. One key component required for
cytochrome c oxidase assembly, identified first in yeast, is the oxa1
gene. Bonnefoy et al. (1994) transformed an oxa- yeast strain with a
HeLa cell expression vector cDNA library and isolated a clone which
complemented the oxa- mutation. The cDNA, designated OXA1Hs by them,
encodes a predicted 435-amino acid protein that is 33% identical to the
yeast gene. Northern blots showed that the 2-kb mRNA was expressed at
relatively high levels in all cell lines tested.

Rotig et al. (1997) determined the OXA1L genomic sequence. Sequence
analysis revealed an additional upstream in-frame translation initiation
codon. Using RT-PCR, the authors demonstrated that this region is
transcribed. The resulting open reading frame encodes a predicted
495-amino acid protein with a putative N-terminal mitochondrial
presequence.

Saaf et al. (1998) noted that the C-terminal membrane domain of OXA1 is
conserved from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. They determined that the 60-kD
OXA1 homolog of E. coli has 6 transmembrane segments. Mitochondrial OXA1
lacks an N-terminal transmembrane domain but otherwise has a similar
hydrophobicity profile to the E. coli protein.

GENE STRUCTURE

Rotig et al. (1997) found that the OXA1L gene contains 10 exons and
spans 5 kb.

MAPPING

Molina-Gomes et al. (1995) mapped the OXA1L gene to 14q11.2 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization.

;;DECOY RECEPTOR 2; DCR2;;
TNF-RELATED APOPTOSIS-INDUCING LIGAND RECEPTOR 4; TRAILR4;;
TRAIL RECEPTOR WITH A TRUNCATED DEATH DOMAIN; TRUNDD
DESCRIPTION TRAIL (603598) is a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family of
cytokines. The TRAIL ligand induces apoptosis in a wide variety of
transformed cell lines of diverse lineage, but does not appear to kill
normal cells. Since TRAIL mRNA is expressed at significant levels in
most normal tissues, the regulation of TRAIL function appears to take
place at the level of receptor expression. The TRAIL receptors TRAILR1
(603611) and TRAILR2 (603612) are capable of mediating apoptosis. A
third receptor, TRAILR3 (603613), lacks a cytoplasmic domain, and may
act as a decoy receptor to inhibit TRAIL signaling. By screening
peripheral blood lymphocyte and foreskin fibroblast libraries with a
cDNA encoding the extracellular domain of TRAILR3, Degli-Esposti et al.
(1997) isolated cDNAs encoding TRAILR4, a novel member of the TRAIL
receptor family. The predicted 386-amino acid TRAILR4 protein contains a
predicted signal sequence, 1 partial and 2 complete cysteine-rich
pseudorepeats in the extracellular domain, an extracellular linker
sequence, a transmembrane region, and a C-terminal sequence containing
one-third of the consensus death domain. The extracellular domain of
TRAILR4 shares 70%, 57%, and 58% identity with those of TRAILR3,
TRAILR2, and TRAILR1, respectively. Transient expression studies showed
that TRAILR4 binds the TRAIL ligand with affinities comparable to those
of TRAILR1, TRAILR2, and TRAILR3. Like TRAILR1 and TRAILR2, TRAILR4
induces nuclear factor-kappa-B (see 164011) activation. Transient
overexpression of TRAILR4 in cells normally sensitive to TRAIL-mediated
apoptosis conferred complete protection, and Degli-Esposti et al. (1997)
suggested that 1 function of TRAILR4 may be the inhibition of TRAIL
cytotoxicity. Northern blot analysis revealed that TRAILR4 was expressed
as an approximately 4-kb mRNA in all tissues tested.

Independently, Marsters et al. (1997) and Pan et al. (1998) isolated
cDNAs encoding TRAILR4, which they designated 'decoy receptor-2' (DCR2)
and 'TRAIL receptor with a truncated death domain' (TRUNDD),
respectively.

By analysis of radiation hybrid panels, Degli-Esposti et al. (1997) and
Marsters et al. (1997) mapped the TRAILR4 gene to 8p21, in a cluster
with the genes encoding TRAILR1, TRAILR2, and TRAILR3.

;;ACETYLCHOLINE RECEPTOR, MUSCARINIC, 1
DESCRIPTION 
GENE FAMILY

Goyal (1989) stated that 5 distinct but related muscarinic receptors had
been identified, with apparent molecular masses ranging from 51,452 to
66,127 kD. These glycosylated proteins have single chains of 460 to 590
amino acids that are thought to span the plasma membrane 7 times,
creating 4 extracellular domains, 7 helical hydrophobic transmembrane
domains, and 4 intracellular domains. Each protein is the product of a
different gene without introns in the coding sequence, and the amino
acid sequences in the receptor subtypes are remarkably homologous among
different animal species (Bonner et al., 1987; Peralta et al., 1987;
Bonner et al., 1988; Liao et al., 1989). The nomenclature is confusing
(Eglen and Whiting, 1986; Goyal, 1989). In structure and evolution,
muscarinic receptors are quite distinct from their pharmacologic kin,
the nicotinic receptors (see 100690, 100710, 100720, 100730).

MAPPING

By means of analysis of somatic cell hybrids and by both isotopic and
nonisotopic in situ hybridization, Bonner et al. (1991) assigned the
CHRM1 gene to 11q12-q13.

Courseaux et al. (1996) used a combination of methods to refine maps of
an approximately 5-Mb region of 11q13. They proposed the following gene
order:
cen--PGA--FTH1--UGB--AHNAK--ROM1--MDU1--CHRM1--COX8--EMK1--FKBP2--PLCB3--[PYGM,
ZFM1]--FAU--CAPN1--[MLK3, RELA]--FOSL1--SEA--CFL1--tel.

GENE FUNCTION

Cholinergic modulation of hippocampal and cortical function plays an
important role in memory and attention. The m1 muscarinic ACh receptor
is abundant in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. Using pharmacologic
agents in rats, Marino et al. (1998) showed that the m1 receptor
modulates NMDA receptor-meditated excitatory synaptic transmission in
hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells.

Dean et al. (2002) tested the hypothesis that muscarinic receptors are
involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia by measuring CHRM1 and
CHRM4 (118495) protein and mRNA as well as [3H]pirenzepine binding in
Brodmann's area (BA) 9 and 40 obtained postmortem from 20 schizophrenic
and 20 age/sex-matched control subjects. They observed a significant
decrease in [3H]pirenzepine binding to BA 9 (p less than 0.02) but not
BA 40 from subjects with schizophrenia. The level of CHRM1 protein (p
less than 0.01) but not CHRM4 protein was decreased in BA 9 from
schizophrenic subjects but neither protein was altered in BA 40. The
level of CHRM1 mRNA was decreased in BA 9 (p less than 0.01) and BA 40
(p less than 0.01) from schizophrenic subjects, but CHRM4 mRNA was
decreased only in BA 40 (p less than 0.005). Dean et al. (2002)
interpreted the data as indicating that CHRM1 changes in the
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex may have a role in the pathology of
schizophrenia.

Seven-transmembrane receptor signaling is transduced by second
messengers such as diacylglycerol (DAG) generated in response to the
heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein G(q) (600998) and is
terminated by receptor desensitization and degradation of the second
messengers. Nelson et al. (2007) showed that beta-arrestins (see 107940)
coordinate both processes for the G(q)-coupled M1 muscarinic receptor
(CHRM1). Beta-arrestins physically interact with diacylglycerol kinases
(see 125855), enzymes that degrade DAG. Moreover, beta-arrestins are
essential for conversion of DAG to phosphatidic acid after agonist
stimulation, and this activity requires recruitment of the
beta-arrestin-DGK complex to activated 7-transmembrane receptors. The
dual function of beta-arrestins, limiting production of diacylglycerol
(by receptor desensitization) while enhancing its rate of degradation,
is analogous to their ability to recruit adenosine
3-prime,5-prime-monophosphate phosphodiesterases to G(s)
(139320)-coupled beta-2-adrenergic receptors (ADRB2; 109690). Thus,
Nelson et al. (2007) concluded that beta-arrestins can serve similar
regulatory functions for disparate classes of 7-transmembrane receptors
through structurally dissimilar enzymes that degrade chemically distinct
second messengers.

Knox et al. (2010) hypothesized that parasympathetic innervation is
required for epithelial progenitor cell function during organogenesis.
Removal of the parasympathetic ganglion in mouse explant organ culture
decreased the number and morphogenesis of keratin 5 (148040)-positive
epithelial progenitor cells. These effects were rescued with an
acetylcholine analog. Knox et al. (2010) demonstrated that acetylcholine
signaling, via the muscarinic M1 receptor and epidermal growth factor
receptor (131550), increased epithelial morphogenesis and proliferation
of the keratin 5-positive progenitor cells. Parasympathetic innervation
maintained the epithelial progenitor cell population in an
undifferentiated state, which was required for organogenesis.

ANIMAL MODEL

Anagnostaras et al. (2003) found that m1-null mice (m1 -/-) showed
normal or enhanced memory for tasks that involved matching-to-sample
problems and are hippocampus-dependent. In contrast, the null mice were
severely impaired in non-matching-to-sample tasks, working memory, and
consolidation, which require the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex.
The results suggested that the m1 receptor is involved in memory
processes in which the cortex and hippocampus interact.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The chromatin-associated enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (ADPRT; EC
2.4.2.30) uses NAD as substrate to catalyze both the covalent transfer
of ADP-ribose to a variety of nuclear protein acceptors and subsequently
the transfer of an additional 60 to 80 ADP-ribose units to the initial
moiety. Nuclear proteins that become predominantly poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated
include nucleosomal core histones, histone H1 (see 142711), HMG proteins
(see 163910), and topoisomerases I (126420) and II (see 126430). ADP
ribosyltransferase is required for cellular repair. Inhibitors of this
enzyme potentiate the lethal effects of noxious agents. During repair,
NAD+ is consumed and the NAD+ content of the cell decreases.
Concomitantly, nuclear proteins are ADP-ribosylated. The enzyme is
induced by single-strand breaks in DNA which serve as cosubstrate for
the reaction.

CLONING

Alkhatib et al. (1987) isolated cDNA clones for this enzyme from a human
hepatoma lambda library and studied its expression. Using synthetic
oligonucleotide probes based on the partial amino acid sequence of
poly(ADP-ribose), Kurosaki et al. (1987) isolated and sequenced cDNA
clones for the enzyme. The open reading frame encodes a protein of 1,013
amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 113,203 Da.

GENE FUNCTION

Loetscher et al. (1987) proposed that poly(ADP-ribose) may signal
altered metabolic conditions to the chromatin. They were led to this
proposal from the finding that the constitutive level of
posttranslational poly(ADP-ribose) modification of chromatin proteins in
mammalian cells is related to the availability of NAD, which varies in
different physiologic and pathologic states.

ADP-ribosylation is a eukaryotic posttranslational modification of
proteins that is strongly induced by the presence of DNA strand breaks
and plays a role in DNA repair and the recovery of cells from DNA
damage. Grube and Burkle (1992) found a strong positive correlation (r =
0.84; P much less than 0.001) between poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, or
PARP, activity and life span, with human cells displaying, for example,
about 5 times the activity of rat cells. The cells studied were
mononuclear leukocytes. Grube and Burkle (1992) suggested that higher
poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation capacity may contribute to the efficient
maintenance of genome integrity.

Yu et al. (2002) demonstrated that PARP1 activation is required for
translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF; 300169) from the
mitochondria to the nucleus and that AIF is necessary for
PARP1-dependent cell death. N-methyl-N-prime-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine,
hydrogen peroxide, and NMDA induce AIF translocation and cell death,
which is prevented by PARP inhibitors or genetic knockout of PARP1, but
is caspase independent. Microinjection of an antibody to AIF protects
against PARP1-dependent cytotoxicity. Yu et al. (2002) concluded that
their data support a model in which PARP1 activation signals AIF release
from mitochondria, resulting in a caspase-independent pathway of
programmed cell death.

Using cultured human cells from malignant cell lines, Nicholson et al.
(1995) demonstrated that PARP is proteolytically cleaved at the onset of
apoptosis by caspase-3 (CASP3; 600636), which they called apopain. In
addition, they showed that inhibition of apopain-mediated PARP cleavage
attenuates apoptosis in vitro.

Tomoda et al. (1991) found that in contrast to reactive proliferative
diseases, malignant lymphomas showed increased expression of
poly(ADP-ribose) synthetase as demonstrated by level of mRNA.

Cohen-Armon et al. (2004) found that poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 is
activated in neurons that mediate several forms of long-term memory in
Aplysia. Because poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of nuclear proteins is a
response to DNA damage in virtually all eukaryotic cells, it is
surprising that activation of the polymerase occurs during learning and
is required for long-term memory. Cohen-Armon et al. (2004) suggested
that the fast and transient decondensation of chromatin structure by
poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation enables the transcription needed to form
long-term memory without strand breaks in DNA.

Vasquez et al. (2001) included the PARP gene in their list of candidate
genes for enhancing gene targeting. Gene targeting by homologous
recombination, which was developed by Smithies et al. (1985), Thomas et
al. (1986), and Thomas and Capecchi (1987), has proven highly valuable
in studies of gene structure and function and offers a potential tool
for gene-therapeutic applications. A limitation constraining this
technology is the low rate of homologous recombination in mammalian
cells and the high rate of random (nontargeted) integration of the
vector DNA. Vasquez et al. (2001) considered possible ways to overcome
these limitations in the framework of the current understanding of
recombination mechanisms and machinery. Several studies suggested that
transient alteration of the levels of recombination proteins, by
overexpression or interference with expression, may be able to increase
homologous recombination or decrease random integration.

Several PARPs localize to the spindle in vertebrate cells, suggesting
that PARPs and/or poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) have a role in spindle
function. Chang et al. (2004) showed that PAR is enriched in the spindle
and is required for spindle function. PAR hydrolysis or perturbation led
to rapid disruption of spindle structure, and hydrolysis during spindle
assembly blocked the formation of bipolar spindles. PAR exhibited
localization dynamics that differed from known spindle proteins and were
consistent with a low rate of turnover in the spindle. Thus, Chang et
al. (2004) concluded that PAR is a nonproteinaceous, nonchromosomal
component of the spindle required for bipolar spindle assembly and
function.

Kim et al. (2004) described nucleosome binding properties of PARP1 that
promoted the formation of compact, transcriptionally repressed chromatin
structures. PARP1 bound in a specific manner to nucleosomes and
modulated chromatin structure through NAD(+)-dependent automodification,
without modifying core histones or promoting the disassembly of
nucleosomes. The automodification activity of PARP1 was potently
stimulated by nucleosomes, causing the release of PARP1 from chromatin.
The NAD(+)-dependent activities of PARP1 were reversed by
poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG; 603501) and were inhibited by
ATP. In vivo, PARP1 incorporation was associated with transcriptionally
repressed chromatin domains that were spatially distinct from both
histone H1-repressed domains and actively transcribed regions. Kim et
al. (2004) concluded that PARP1 functions both as a structural component
of chromatin and as a modulator of chromatin structure through its
intrinsic enzymatic activity.

Pavri et al. (2005) determined that PARP1 was necessary for retinoic
acid (RA)-dependent transcription in HeLa cells, and transcription
required the direct interaction of PARP1 with the mediator complex (see
MED6; 602984). The interaction did not require the C-terminal catalytic
domain of PARP1. By chromatin immunoprecipitation of a mouse embryonic
carcinoma cell line, Pavri et al. (2005) found that Parp1 localized to
the RA-responsive promoter of the mouse Rarb2 gene (RARB; 180220). Parp1
was necessary for the activation of the mediator complex and for
transcription from the Rarb2 promoter. Pavri et al. (2005) also found
that Parp1 functioned at a step prior to the association of TFIID (see
313650) and mediator with promoter sequences.

Bryant et al. (2005) showed that PARP inhibitors trigger gamma-H2AX (see
601772) and RAD51 (179617) foci formation. They proposed that, in the
absence of PARP1, spontaneous single-strand breaks collapse replication
forks and trigger homologous recombination for repair. Furthermore,
Bryant et al. (2005) showed that BRCA2 (600185)-deficient cells, as a
result of their deficiency in homologous recombination, are acutely
sensitive to PARP inhibitors, presumably because resultant collapsed
replication forks are no longer repaired. Thus, PARP1 activity is
essential in homologous recombination-deficient BRCA2 mutant cells.
Bryant et al. (2005) exploited this requirement in order to kill
BRCA2-deficient tumors by PARP inhibition alone. Treatment with PARP
inhibitors is likely to be highly tumor specific, because only the
tumors (which are BRCA2-null) in BRCA2 heterozygous patients are
defective in homologous recombination. Bryant et al. (2005) concluded
that the use of an inhibitor of a DNA repair enzyme alone to selectively
kill a tumor, in the absence of an exogenous DNA-damaging agent,
represents a new concept in cancer treatment.

Farmer et al. (2005) showed that BRCA1 (113705) or BRCA2 dysfunction
unexpectedly and profoundly sensitizes cells to the inhibition of PARP
enzymatic activity, resulting in chromosomal instability, cell cycle
arrest, and subsequent apoptosis. This seems to be because the
inhibition of PARP leads to the persistence of DNA lesions normally
repaired by homologous recombination. Farmer et al. (2005) concluded
that their results illustrate how different pathways cooperate to repair
damage, and suggest that the targeted inhibition of particular DNA
repair pathways may allow the design of specific and less toxic
therapies for cancer.

Andrabi et al. (2006) and Yu et al. (2006) demonstrated that the product
of PARP1 activity, poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) polymer, mediates
PARP1-induced cell death. Andrabi et al. (2006) showed PAR polymer alone
could induce cell death in primary mouse cortical neurons in a caspase-
and Parp1-independent manner. Degradation of PAR polymer by PAR
glycohydrolase (PARG; 603501) or phosphodiesterase-1 (see PDE1A, 171890)
prevented PAR polymer-induced cell death in cultured neurons, and
increased Parg expression in mice reduced damage caused by ischemia
following middle cerebral artery occlusion. Yu et al. (2006) showed that
PAR polymer was the cell death signal that induced the release of Aif
from mitochondria mouse cortical neurons and induced its translocation
to nuclei. They also showed that Parg prevented Parp1-dependent Aif
release. Furthermore, cells with reduced levels of Aif were resistant to
Parp1-dependent cell death and PAR polymer cytotoxicity.

Apoptosis controls the final numbers of neurons during brain
development. Midorikawa et al. (2006) found that mouse Kif4 (300521), a
microtubule-based molecular motor, regulated apoptosis of juvenile
neurons by interacting directly with Parp1. The C-terminal domain of
Kif4 suppressed Parp1 enzymatic activity. When neurons were stimulated
by membrane depolarization, calcium signaling mediated by Camk2 (see
114078) induced dissociation of Kif4 from Parp1, resulting in
upregulation of Parp1 activity, which supported neuron survival. After
dissociation from Parp1, Kif4 entered the cytoplasm from the nucleus and
moved to the distal part of neurites in a microtubule-dependent manner.
Midorikawa et al. (2006) concluded that KIF4 controls the
activity-dependent survival of postmitotic neurons by regulating PARP1
activity in brain development.

Krishnakumar et al. (2008) used genomic and gene-specific approaches to
show that 2 factors, histone H1 and PARP1, exhibit a reciprocal pattern
of chromatin binding at many RNA polymerase II-transcribed promoters.
PARP1 was enriched and H1 was depleted at these promoters. This pattern
of binding was associated with actively transcribed genes. Furthermore,
Krishnakumar et al. (2008) showed that PARP1 acts to exclude H1 from a
subset of PARP1-stimulated promoters, suggesting a functional interplay
between PARP1 and H1 at the level of nucleosome binding. Thus,
Krishnakumar et al. (2008) concluded that although H1 and PARP1 have
similar nucleosome-binding properties and effects on chromatin structure
in vitro, they have distinct roles in determining gene expression in
vivo.

'Synthetic lethality' as a treatment for cancer refers to an event in
which tumor cell death results from lethal synergy of 2 otherwise
nonlethal events. Fong et al. (2009) used this model to treat breast
cancer cells that have homozygous loss of the tumor suppressor genes
BRCA1 (113705) or BRCA2 (600185) with a PARP inhibitor, resulting in the
induction of selective tumor cytotoxicity and the sparing of normal
cells. The method aims at inhibiting PARP-mediated single-strand DNA
repair in cells with deficient homologous-recombination double-strand
DNA repair, which leads to unrepaired DNA breaks, the accumulation of
DNA defects, and cell death. Heterozygous BRCA mutant cells retain
homologous-recombination function and are not affected by PARP
inhibition. In vitro, BRCA1-deficient and BRCA2-deficient cells were up
to 1,000-fold more sensitive to PARP inhibition than wildtype cells, and
tumor growth inhibition was also demonstrated in BRCA2-deficient
xenografts. Fong et al. (2009) reported a phase 1 clinical trial of an
orally active PARP inhibitor olaparib (AZD2281 or KU-0059436) in 60
patients with mainly breast or ovarian cancer (612555; 604370),
including 22 BRCA mutation carriers and 1 who was likely a mutation
carrier but declined genetic testing. Durable objective antitumor
activity was observed only in confirmed carriers of a BRCA1 or BRCA2
mutation; no objective antitumor responses were observed in patients
without known BRCA mutations. Twelve (63%) of 19 BRCA carriers with
ovarian, breast, or prostate cancers showed a clinical benefit from
treatment with olaparib, with radiologic or tumor-marker responses or
meaningful disease stabilization. The drug had an acceptable side-effect
profile and did not have the toxic effects commonly associated with
conventional chemotherapy. Fong et al. (2009) concluded that PARP
inhibition has antitumor activity in BRCA mutation carriers.

In mammalian cells subjected to oxidative stress, Mao et al. (2011)
showed that SIRT6 (606211) is recruited to the sites of DNA
double-strand breaks and stimulates double-strand break repair, through
both nonhomologous end joining and homologous recombination. Mao et al.
(2011) concluded that their results indicated that SIRT6 physically
associates with PARP1 and mono-ADP-ribosylates PARP1 on lysine residue
521, thereby stimulating PARP1 poly-ADP-ribosylase activity and
enhancing double-strand break repair under oxidative stress.

Doege et al. (2012) described an early and essential stage of somatic
cell reprogramming, preceding the induction of transcription at
endogenous pluripotency loci such as NANOG (607937) and ESRRB (602167).
By day 4 after transduction with pluripotency factors OCT4 (164177),
SOX2 (184429), KLF4 (602253), and MYC (190080) (together referred to as
OSKM), 2 epigenetic modification factors necessary for induced
pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) generation, namely, PARP1 and TET2
(612839), were recruited to the NANOG and ESRRB loci. These epigenetic
modification factors seem to have complementary roles in the
establishment of early epigenetic marks during somatic cell
reprogramming: PARP1 functions in the regulation of 5-methylcytosine
(5mC) modification, whereas TET2 is essential for the early generation
of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) by the oxidation of 5mC. Although 5hmC
has been proposed to serve primarily as an intermediate in 5mC
demethylation to cytosine in certain contexts, Doege et al. (2012)
concluded that their data, and also studies of TET2-mutant human tumor
cells, argued in favor of a role for 5hmC as an epigenetic mark distinct
from 5mC. Consistent with this, PARP1 and TET2 are each needed for the
early establishment of histone modifications that typify an activated
chromatin state at pluripotency loci, whereas PARP1 induction further
promotes accessibility to the OCT4 reprogramming factor. Doege et al.
(2012) concluded that their findings suggested that PARP1 and TET2
contribute to an epigenetic program that directs subsequent
transcriptional induction at pluripotency loci during somatic cell
reprogramming.

MAPPING

McBride et al. (1987) concluded that a large functional PARP gene of
more than 15 to 20 kb is located on chromosome 1q and that sequences on
chromosomes 13 and 14 most likely represent processed pseudogenes. These
localizations were achieved by probing of the DNA from panels of somatic
cell hybrids.

Herzog et al. (1988) cloned a cDNA for ADPRT and localized the gene to
1q21-q22 by in situ hybridization. Herzog et al. (1989) mapped the ADPRT
gene to 1q41-q42 by in situ hybridization. Using high resolution in situ
hybridization techniques, Zabel et al. (1989) localized PPOL to
1q41-q42. With the conditions used, only 1 additional site of
hybridization, 14q22, could be detected; this probably represented a
pseudogene which had previously been identified and called ADPRTP2. By
nonisotopic in situ hybridization, Baumgartner et al. (1992) confirmed
localization of the functional gene to 1q42. Two other hybridization
peaks, one at 13q34 and one at 14q24, suggested the location of
pseudogenes.

- PARP Pseudogene

A processed pseudogene or a gene with extensive identity to the ADPRT
gene was studied by Bhatia et al. (1990), who mapped it to 13q33-qter.
The gene was deleted in a polymorphism that was 3 times higher in
frequency among blacks than Caucasians. Bhatia et al. (1990) suggested
that this deletion might be a predisposing factor in several forms of
malignancy.

Lyn et al. (1993) studied the 2-allele (A/B) polymorphism of the gene on
13q34. An elevated B-allele frequency was found in germline DNA in
blacks with multiple myeloma (254500), prostate cancer (176807), and
colon cancer (114500). They found that the A allele has a close sequence
similarity (91.8%) to the PPOL cDNA coded by 1q42 and is intronless,
suggesting that the gene on 13q is a processed pseudogene. They
presented data indicating that the polymorphism reflects a 193-bp
duplication within the processed-pseudogene sequence, with absence of
this duplicated region being characteristic of the B genotype. Doll et
al. (1996) confirmed the association between prostate cancer in black
Americans and an allele of the pseudogene locus (which they symbolized
PADPRP) on chromosome 13. Two genes in the region 13q33-q34 were viewed
as potential candidates for prostate cancer: ERCC5 (133530) and RAP2A
(179540).

GENE STRUCTURE

Auer et al. (1989) demonstrated that the PARP gene is 43 kb long and
split into 23 exons.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Langelier et al. (2012) reported the crystal structure of a DNA
double-strand break in complex with human PARP1 domains essential for
activation (Zn1, Zn3, WGR-CAT). PARP1 engages DNA as a monomer, and the
interaction with DNA damage organizes PARP1 domains into a collapsed
conformation that could explain the strong preference for
automodification. The Zn1, Zn3, and WGR domains collectively bind to
DNA, forming a network of interdomain contacts that links the DNA damage
interface to the catalytic domain (CAT). The DNA damage-induced
conformation of PARP1 results in structural distortions that destabilize
the CAT. Langelier et al. (2012) concluded that an increase in CAT
protein dynamics underlies the DNA-dependent activation mechanism of
PARP1.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Schweiger et al. (1987) suggested that the defect in Fanconi anemia (FA;
227650) is one of impaired ADP-ribosylation. Several independent
observations have suggested that ADPRT might be the site of the mutation
in Fanconi anemia; however, Flick et al. (1992) could find no
abnormality in cells from an FA patient of complementation group A (cell
line GM6914).

ANIMAL MODEL

Streptozotocin (STZ) selectively destroys insulin-producing beta islet
cells of the pancreas, providing a model of type I diabetes (see
222100). PARP is a nuclear enzyme whose overactivation by DNA strand
breaks depletes its substrate NAD+ and then ATP, leading to cellular
death from energy depletion. Pieper et al. (1999) demonstrated DNA
damage and a major activation of PARP in pancreatic islets of
STZ-treated mice. These mice displayed a 5-fold increase in blood
glucose and major pancreatic islet damage. In mice with homozygous
targeted deletion of Parp, blood glucose and pancreatic islet structure
were normal, indicating virtually total protection from STZ diabetes.
Partial protection occurred in heterozygous animals. Thus, PARP
activation may participate in the pathophysiology of type I diabetes,
for which PARP inhibitors might afford therapeutic benefit.

Using 2 different techniques, d'Adda di Fagagna et al. (1999) showed
that mice lacking PARP display telomere shortening compared with
wildtype mice. Telomere shortening was seen in different genetic
backgrounds and in different tissues from embryos and adult mice. In
vitro telomerase activity, however, was not altered in Adprt1 -/- mouse
fibroblasts. Furthermore, cytogenetic analysis of mouse embryonic
fibroblasts showed that lack of PARP was associated with severe
chromosomal instability, characterized by increased frequency of
chromosome fusions and aneuploidy. The absence of PARP does not affect
the presence of single-strand overhangs, naturally present at the end of
telomeres. This study, therefore, revealed an unanticipated role of PARP
in telomere length regulation and provided insight into its functions in
maintaining genomic integrity.

Depletion of PARP increases the frequency of recombination, gene
amplification, sister chromatid exchanges, and micronuclei formation in
cells exposed to genotoxic agents, implicating PARP in the maintenance
of genomic stability. By flow cytometric analysis, Simbulan-Rosenthal et
al. (1999) demonstrated an unstable tetraploid population in
immortalized fibroblasts derived from PARP -/- mice. There were partial
chromosomal gains in other regions. Neither the chromosomal gains nor
the tetraploid population were apparent in PARP -/- cells stably
transfected with PARP cDNA, indicating negative selection of cells with
these genetic alterations after reintroduction of PARP cDNA. These
results implicated PARP in the maintenance of genomic stability.

Steroid response and stress-activated genes such as Hsp70 (see 140550)
undergo puffing, a local loosening of polytene chromatin structure
associated with gene induction, in Drosophila larval salivary glands.
Tulin and Spradling (2003) found that puffs acquired elevated levels of
ADP-ribose modified proteins and that PARP was required to produce
normal-sized puffs and normal amounts of Hsp70 after heat exposure.
Tulin and Spradling (2003) proposed that chromosomal PARP molecules
become activated by developmental or environmental cues and strip nearby
chromatin proteins off DNA to generate a puff. Such local loosening may
facilitate transcription and may transiently make protein complexes more
accessible to modification, promoting chromatin remodeling during
development.

To understand the biologic significance of PARP1 cleavage, Petrilli et
al. (2004) generated a PARP1 knockin mouse model in which the caspase
cleavage site of PARP1, DEVD(214), was mutated to render the protein
resistant to caspases during apoptosis. The Parp1 knockin mice were
highly resistant to endotoxic shock and to intestinal and renal
ischemia/reperfusion, which were associated with reduced inflammatory
responses in the target tissues and cells due to the compromised
production of specific inflammatory mediators. Despite normal binding of
nuclear factor kappa-B (see 164011) to DNA, NFKB-mediated transcription
activity was impaired in the presence of caspase-resistant PARP1.
Petrilli et al. (2004) concluded that the PARP1 cleavage event is
physiologically relevant to the regulation of the inflammatory response
in vivo.

Using flow cytometric analysis, Ambrose et al. (2008) demonstrated
increased T-cell and normal B-cell numbers in Parp1 -/- mice. Basal Ig
levels were abnormal due to reduced levels of IgG2a and increased levels
of IgA and IgG2b. T cell-dependent antibody responses were reduced, but
T cell-independent responses were normal. In vitro, activated Parp1 -/-
B cells proliferated and secreted IgM normally, but they exhibited
decreased switching to IgG2a and increased IgA secretion. Ambrose et al.
(2008) concluded that PARP1 has essential roles in normal T
cell-dependent antibody responses and in regulation of isotype
expression.

Werner syndrome (WS; 277700) is a rare disorder characterized by the
premature onset of a number of age-related diseases and is caused by
mutation in the RECQL2 (604611) gene, which is believed to be involved
in different aspects of transcription, replication, and/or DNA repair.
PARP1 is also involved in DNA repair and is known to affect
transcription of several genes. Deschenes et al. (2005) examined the
expression profile of mouse embryonic cells lacking both Recql2 and
Parp1 using microarray and RT-PCR analysis. All mutant cells exhibited
altered expression of genes normally responding to oxidative stress.
More than 50% of misregulated genes identified in double-mutant mouse
cells were not altered in mouse cells with either the Recql2 or Parp1
mutation alone. The impact on gene expression profile when both Recql2
and Parp1 were mutated was greater than a simple addition of individual
mutant genotype. In addition, double-mutant cultured mouse cells showed
major misregulation of genes involved in apoptosis, cell cycle control,
embryonic development, metabolism, and signal transduction.
Double-mutant mouse embryos showed increased apoptosis and developmental
defects with decreased survival in utero. Surviving adult double-mutant
mice exhibited high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and DNA
oxidative damage and increased intracellular protein phosphorylation in
heart and liver compared to wildtype.

By flow cytometric analysis of thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes from
Parp1 -/- mice, Nasta et al. (2010) detected increased Cd4
(186940)-positive/Cd25 (IL2RA; 147730)-positive/Foxp3 (300292)-positive
regulatory T lymphocytes (Tregs). The increased Tregs in the periphery
resulted in impaired CD4 cell proliferation and IL2 (147680) production,
which could be restored by depletion of Cd25-positive cells. Treg
inhibitory function of Parp1 -/- cells was comparable to wildtype,
suggesting that PARP1 affects Treg differentiation rather than function.
Naive CD4 cells from Parp1 -/- mice expressed higher levels of Foxp3 and
converted more cells to Foxp3-positive inducible Tregs following
stimulation than their wildtype counterparts. Conversion to Th17 (see
IL17; 603149) cells expressing Rorgt (602943) was not affected by Parp1
deficiency. Nasta et al. (2010) proposed that PARP1 modulation during an
immune response may induce greater numbers of functional Tregs.

;;INDUCED BY LYMPHOCYTE ACTIVATION; ILA;;

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ILA is a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family (see
191190). Members of this receptor family and their structurally related
ligands are important regulators of a wide variety of physiologic
processes and play an important role in the regulation of immune
responses. ILA is expressed by activated T and B lymphocytes and
monocytes.

CLONING

Schwarz et al. (1993) isolated the ILA gene from a library constructed
from activated human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV) type 1-transformed
human T-lymphocytes. The gene, also called CD137, encodes a 255-amino
acid protein with 3 cysteine-rich motifs in the extracellular domain
(characteristic of this receptor family), a transmembrane region, and a
short N-terminal cytoplasmic portion containing potential
phosphorylation sites. Its mouse homolog, 4-1BB, was cloned by Kwon and
Weissman (1989) in screens for receptors expressed on activated
lymphocytes and has 59.6% amino acid identity to ILA. Expression in
primary cells is strictly activation dependent. Constitutive expression
was detected only in oncogenically or virally transformed cells.

Alderson et al. (1994) cloned TNFRSF9 and its ligand, TNFSF9 (606182).

GENE FUNCTION

Schwarz et al. (1996) reported that ILA inhibits proliferation of
activated T lymphocytes and induces programmed cell death.

Loo et al. (1997) reported that, unlike its mouse counterpart, human
4-1BB binds only to its ligand, TNFSF9, and not to extracellular matrix
proteins such as laminin (see 150240). The authors attributed this
species distinction to sequence differences in the N-terminal
laminin-homologous domain of human 4-1BB.

Munks et al. (2004) found that stimulation of 4-1BB in mice at the time
of a DNA prime, poxvirus vaccine, increased the number of functional
memory CD8 (see 186910) T cells that responded, while stimulation of
OX40 (TNFRSF4; 600315) increased the number of antigen-specific CD4
(186940) T cells that responded. Stimulating both of these TNFRs
enhanced the CD8 response more than stimulating 4-1BB alone. Munks et
al. (2004) suggested that stimulating these receptors can improve the
response to a powerful virus vector and may be useful in vaccine
development.

MAPPING

Schwarz et al. (1997) localized the ILA gene to chromosome 1p36 by
somatic cell hybrid analysis. This chromosomal region harbors several
other members of this receptor family (e.g., TNFR2, 191191; CD30,
153243; OX40; and TAMP/Apo3, 603366) and is associated with deletions
and rearrangements in several malignancies, including neuroblastomas,
myelodysplastic syndrome, and refractory acute nonlymphocytic leukemia.

ANIMAL MODEL

Sun et al. (2002) reported that treatment with 2A, an agonistic
monoclonal antibody to CD137, blocked lymphadenopathy and spontaneous
autoimmune disease in Fas (TNFRSF6; 134637)-deficient mice (a model for
human systemic lupus erythematosus, 152700), ultimately leading to their
prolonged survival. Specifically, 2A treatment rapidly augmented
interferon-gamma (IFNG; 147570) production and induced the depletion of
autoreactive B cells and abnormal double-negative T cells, possibly by
increasing their apoptosis through Fas- and TNF receptor-independent
mechanisms. Sun et al. (2002) concluded that agonistic monoclonal
antibodies specific for costimulatory molecules could be used as novel
therapeutic agents to deplete autoreactive lymphocytes and block
autoimmune disease progression.

Collagen type II (120140)-induced arthritis is a Cd4-positive T
cell-dependent chronic inflammation in susceptible DBA/1 mice and
represents a model for human rheumatoid arthritis (180300). Seo et al.
(2004) found that an agonistic anti-4-1BB monoclonal antibody (Mab)
inhibited development of collagen type II-induced arthritis, as well as
established disease, in DBA/1 mice. The Mab suppressed both serum
antibody to collagen type II and Cd4-positive T-cell recall responses to
the antigen. Mab treatment induced massive, antigen-dependent clonal
expansion of Ifng-producing Cd11c (ITGAX; 151510)-positive/Cd8-positive
T cells and the accumulation of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (INDO;
147435) in Cd11b (ITGM; 120980)-positive monocytes and Cd11c-positive
dendritic cells. Treatment with anti-Ifng or an inhibitor of Indo
reversed the beneficial effects. Seo et al. (2004) concluded that
expansion of a new population of Cd11c-positive/Cd8-positive T cells
producing large amounts of Ifng mediated the suppression of
collagen-induced arthritis through an Indo-dependent mechanism.

Zhang et al. (2007) showed that injection of anti-CD137 into mice 1 day
before infection with influenza virus resulted in 80% mortality, whereas
administration of the antibody 1 day after infection resulted in 100%
survival. Similar findings in terms of antibody administration before
and after infection were obtained with a lymphocytic choriomeningitis
virus model. Zhang et al. (2007) concluded that the timing of anti-CD137
administration profoundly alters the nature of antiviral immunity.

McNamara et al. (2008) noted that agonistic anti-4-1bb antibodies
enhance tumor immunity in mice. Aptamers are oligonucleotide-based
ligands with specificity and avidity comparable to, or exceeding, that
of antibodies. McNamara et al. (2008) showed that multivalent
configurations of a 4-1bb-binding aptamer costimulated T-cell activation
in vitro and mediated tumor rejection in mice. They concluded that
aptamers may be superior to antibodies in therapeutic manipulation of
the immune system, since they have a simpler manufacturing and approval
process and are less likely to induce autoimmunity.

Wang et al. (2010) found that injection of anti-CD137, a mimic of
CD137L, in hepatitis B virus (HBV; see 610424)-transgenic mice promoted
liver disease progression from hepatitis to fibrosis, cirrhosis, and,
ultimately, liver cancer. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated an
increase in the percentage of Cd8-positive intrahepatic lymphocytes in
HBV-transgenic mice treated with anti-CD137. Depletion of Cd8-positive,
Cd4-positive, or natural killer cells showed that Cd8-positive T cells,
which were not specific for HBV and produced Ifng, were the main
mediators of liver fibrosis induced by CD137 stimulation. Ifng, in turn,
induced macrophage production of other fibrosis-promoting cytokines and
chemokines, including Tnf (191160), Il6 (147620), and Mcp1 (CCL2;
158105). Wang et al. (2010) proposed that sustained CD137 stimulation is
a contributing factor for liver immunopathology in chronic HBV
infection, suggesting that a common defense pathway against viral
infection also causes chronic hepatic diseases.

;;AMP-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE, NONCATALYTIC, BETA-2;;
AMPK-BETA-2
DESCRIPTION The mammalian 5-prime-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) appears to act
as a metabolic stress-sensing protein kinase. AMPK is a heterotrimeric
protein composed of a catalytic alpha subunit, a noncatalytic beta
subunit, and a noncatalytic gamma subunit. See PRKAA1 (602739) and
PRKAB1 (602740) for additional background.

CLONING

Using the yeast 2-hybrid system to identify proteins that interact with
AMPK-alpha-2 (PRKAA2; 600497), Thornton et al. (1998) isolated human
skeletal muscle cDNAs encoding AMPK-beta-2 (PRKAB2). The predicted
272-amino acid AMPK-beta-2 protein has 71% sequence identity with
AMPK-beta-1 (PRKAB1). Northern blot analysis revealed that AMPK-beta-2
is expressed as a 7.5-kb mRNA in a variety of human tissues, with the
highest levels in skeletal and cardiac muscle. Based on their different
expression patterns in rat, Thornton et al. (1998) suggested that the
Ampk-beta-1 and Ampk-beta-2 isoforms have tissue-specific roles.

180231	TITLE *180231 RETINOIC ACID-BINDING PROTEIN, CELLULAR, TYPE II; CRABP2
DESCRIPTION CRABP2 is highly expressed in human skin. Giguere et al. (1990) isolated
a cDNA encoding mouse Crabp-2 by a low stringency cloning strategy using
a probe from previously cloned CRABP1 cDNA (180230). MacGregor et al.
(1992) determined the genomic organization of the murine Crabp-2 gene
and performed a detailed analysis of its transcriptional unit. It was
shown to be approximately 4.6 kb long and divided into 4 exons in a
structure common to other members of the family of serum and cellular
retinoid-binding proteins. The chromosomal location of the Crabp-2 locus
was determined by interspecific backcross analysis using progeny derived
from matings of C57BL/6J and M. spretus. Mapping results indicated that
the gene is located on mouse chromosome 2 linked to muscle nicotinic
acetylcholine receptor alpha-chain (Acra) and catalase-1 (Cas-1).
MacGregor et al. (1992) suggested that the human homolog is located on
2q or 11p. Elder et al. (1992) localized the CRABP2 gene to 1q21 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization. Localization was confirmed by
hybridization of a CRABP2 cDNA clone against a human/mouse hybrid cell
line containing a t(1;6)(q21;q13) translocation chromosome.

Flagiello et al. (1997) mapped CRABP2 to 1q21.3 by fluorescence in situ
hybridization.

DESCRIPTION 
GENE FUNCTION

Phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of the largest subunit of RNA
polymerase II (POLR2A; 180660) is believed to control the transition
from transcription initiation to elongation. The general transcription
factor TFIIH contains a kinase activity capable of phosphorylating this
domain (Lu et al., 1992). Factors that promote the association of RNA
polymerase II with the preinitiation complex stimulate this activity.
TFIIE, which is required for the stable association of TFIIH with the
preinitiation complex, affects the processivity of TFIIH kinase. TFIIH
is a multisubunit factor consisting of at least 5 polypeptides of 92
(133510), 62, 43 (601748), 40, and 35 (601750) kD (Flores et al., 1992).
A 52-kD subunit (601760) has also been identified as a component of the
TFIIH 'core,' along with p89, p62, p44, and p34 (Marinoni et al., 1997).
Lu et al. (1992) expressed the belief that TFIIH is the human
counterpart of the yeast general transcription factor b. See also 133530
and Habraken et al. (1996).

Shiekhattar et al. (1995) purified TFIIH and found that it contained
material that reacted with antibodies to cyclin-dependent kinase 7
(CDK7; 601955) and cyclin H (601953). The authors confirmed the presence
of the CDK-activating kinase complex as a distinct component of TFIIH,
suggesting a link, by the phosphorylation of the cell division cycle 2
(116940) or CDK2 (116953) genes, between TFIIH and the processes of
transcription, DNA repair, and cell cycle progression.

Mammalian CDK8 (603184) and cyclin C (123838) are components of the RNA
polymerase II holoenzyme complex, where they function as a protein
kinase that phosphorylates the C-terminal domain of the largest subunit
of RNA polymerase II. The CDK8/cyclin C protein complex is also found in
a number of mammalian 'Mediator'(see 602984)-like protein complexes,
which repress activated transcription independently of the C-terminal
domain in vitro. Akoulitchev et al. (2000) demonstrated that CDK8/cyclin
C can regulate transcription by targeting the CDK7/cyclin H subunits of
TFIIH. CDK8 phosphorylates mammalian cyclin H at serine-5 and serine-304
both in vitro and in vivo, in the vicinity of its functionally unique N-
and C-terminal alpha-helical domains. This phosphorylation represses
both the ability of TFIIH to activate transcription and its C-terminal
kinase activity. In addition, mimicking CDK8 phosphorylation of cyclin H
in vivo has a dominant-negative effect on cell growth. Akoulitchev et
al. (2000) concluded that their results linked the Mediator complex and
the basal transcription machinery by a regulatory pathway involving 2
cyclin-dependent kinases. This pathway appears to be unique to higher
organisms.

High levels of gene transcription by RNA polymerase II depend on high
rates of transcription initiation and reinitiation. Initiation requires
recruitment of the complete transcription machinery to a promoter, a
process facilitated by activators and chromatin remodeling factors.
Reinitiation is thought to occur through a different pathway. After
initiation, a subset of the transcription machinery remains at the
promoter, forming a platform for assembly of a second transcription
complex. Yudkovsky et al. (2000) described the isolation of a
reinitiation intermediate in yeast that includes transcription factors
TFIID, TFIIA (see 600520), TFIIH, TFIIE, and Mediator. This intermediate
can act as a scaffold for formation of a functional reinitiation
complex. Formation of this scaffold is dependent on ATP and TFIIH. In
yeast, the scaffold is stabilized in the presence of the activator
Gal4-VP16, but not Gal4-AH, suggesting a new role for some activators
and Mediator in promoting high levels of transcription.

Hoogstraten et al. (2002) generated cell lines expressing functional
GFP-tagged TFIIH. TFIIH was homogeneously distributed throughout the
nucleus with nucleolar accumulations. The authors provided in vivo
evidence for involvement of TFIIH in RNA polymerase I transcription.
Photobleaching revealed that TFIIH moved freely and was engaged in RNA
polymerase I and II transcription for approximately 25 seconds and
approximately 6 seconds, respectively. TFIIH readily switched between
transcription and repair sites, where it was immobilized for 4 minutes,
without large-scale alterations in composition. These findings supported
a model of diffusion and random collision of individual components that
permits a quick and versatile response to changing conditions.

Trichothiodystrophy (TTD; 601675) is a rare hereditary multisystem
disorder associated with defects in nucleotide excision repair (NER) as
a consequence of mutation in XPD (126340), XPB (133510), or TTDA
(608780), 3 genes that are related to TFIIH. Botta et al. (2002) showed
that all the mutations found in TTD cases, irrespective of whether they
were homozygotes, hemizygotes, or compound heterozygotes, caused a
substantial and specific reduction (by up to 70%) in the cellular
concentration of TFIIH. However, the degree of reduction in TFIIH did
not correlate with the severity of the pathologic phenotype, suggesting
that the severity of the clinical features in TTD cannot be related
solely to the effects of mutations on the stability of TFIIH. Mild
reductions (up to 40%) in TFIIH content were also found in some, but not
all, cell strains from patients with xeroderma pigmentosum (see 278700).
Botta et al. (2002) concluded that the severity of the clinical features
in TTD patients and the clinical outcome of differentially mutated XPD
proteins may depend both on the effects that each mutation has on the
stability of TFIIH as well as on the transcriptional activity of the
residual TFIIH complexes.

GENE FAMILY

Initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II is a complex process
requiring, in addition to the polymerase itself, 7 auxiliary factors.
Entry of the polymerase into the transcription cycle is mediated by
transcription factor TFIIF (see 189968) and requires a DNA-protein
complex composed of the TATA-binding protein subunit of TFIID (313650)
in association with the TATA motif and TFIIB (189963), the so-called DB
complex. The largest subunit of mammalian RNA polymerase II (POLR2A;
180660) contains a heptapeptide repeat, YSPTSPS in the single-letter
amino acid code, occurring 52 times at its C terminus. Because the
heptapeptide contains serine, threonine, and tyrosine, it is prone to
phosphorylation. As a result, RNA polymerase II occurs in 2 forms in
vivo: a highly phosphorylated II(O) form and a nonphosphorylated II(A)
form. The nonphosphorylated form of RNA polymerase II is recruited by
TFIIF to the DB complex. This complex is then recognized by TFIIE
(189962), TFIIH, and TFIIJ, which enter the transcription cycle in that
order, to generate a transcription-competent complex (summary by Lu et
al., 1992).

Giglia-Mari et al. (2004) tabulated the 10 subunits of TFIIH. They
referred to GTF2H1 as TFB1.

MAPPING

Heng et al. (1994) mapped the GTF2H1 gene to 11p15.1-p14 by fluorescence
in situ hybridization.

By PCR analysis on hybrid DNAs and the YACs, Fantes et al. (1995) placed
the GTF2H1 gene in their interval XX between the LDHA/C (150000; 150150)
and the SAA (104750) genes. Furthermore, restriction mapping placed
GTF2H1 within 50 kb of LDHA.

Fantes et al. (1995) described a detailed physical map of 11p, extending
from the distal part of 11p13 through the entirety of 11p14 to proximal
11p15.1. The primary level of mapping was based on chromosome
breakpoints that divided the region into 20 intervals. At higher
resolution, YACs covered approximately 12 Mb of the region. The map
incorporated 18 known genes, including precise localization of the
GTF2H1 gene encoding the 62-kD subunit of TFIIH.

607292	TITLE *607292 SEMAPHORIN 4A; SEMA4A
;;SEMAPHORIN B; SEMAB; SEMB
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SEMA4A is a member of the semaphorin family of soluble and transmembrane
proteins. Semaphorins are involved in guidance of axonal migration
during neuronal development and in immune responses.

CLONING

Using degenerate PCR primers based on motifs conserved in members of the
semaphorin family, Kumanogoh et al. (2002) identified mouse Sema4a,
which was originally identified as SemB (Puschel et al., 1995). RT-PCR
analysis detected prominent expression in adult mouse brain, spleen,
lung, kidney, and testis. Flow cytometric analysis showed expression in
B cells and dendritic cells (DCs) but not in resting T cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Kumanogoh et al. (2002) showed that activation upregulated expression of
mouse Sema4a in both B and T cells, and proliferation and interleukin-2
(IL2; 147680) production by T cells were enhanced in the presence of
Sema4a. However, Sema4a, unlike CD100 (SEMA4D; 601866), did not enhance
the activation of B cells or DCs. Mice treated with Sema4a had enhanced
priming of antigen-specific T cells secreting both IL4 (147780) and
gamma-interferon (IFNG; 147570). Treatment of mice with anti-Sema4a
early after immunization with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein
suppressed the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.
In these mice, infiltration of mononuclear inflammatory cells was
ablated by inhibition of the generation of antigen-specific T cells by
anti-Sema4a. Expression cloning determined that the high-affinity
receptor for Sema4a is Tim2. Sema4a stimulation of cells expressing Tim2
induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Tim2 but not of Tim3 (606652).
Kumanogoh et al. (2002) concluded that Sema4a and CD100 have crucial
roles in the reciprocal stimulation between T cell and
antigen-presenting cells.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Abid et al. (2006) screened 135 Pakistani patients with retinitis
pigmentosa (RP35; 610282), 25 with cone-rod dystrophy (CORD10; 610283),
and 30 with congenital blindness for mutations in the SEMA4A gene. They
identified compound heterozygosity for 2 substitutions
(607292.0001-607292.0002) in 2 RP and 2 CORD patients and heterozygosity
for another substitution (607292.0003) in 3 patients with RP and 1
patient with congenital blindness. No mutations in SEMA4A were found in
affected members of a Pakistani family with cone-rod dystrophy (CORD8;
605549) previously mapped to chromosome 1q12-q24 (Ismail et al., 2006).

SEMA4A, ASP345HIS

In 2 Pakistani patients with retinitis pigmentosa-35 (610282) and 2 with
cone-rod dystrophy-10 (610282), Abid et al. (2006) identified compound
heterozygosity for a G-to-C transversion in codon 345 and a T-to-G
transversion in codon 350 in exon 10 of the SEMA4A gene, resulting in an
asp345-to-his (D345H) and a phe350-to-cys (F350C; 607292.0002)
substitution in the conserved semaphorin domain, respectively. Sequence
analysis of the unaffected parents of 1 of the CORD patients revealed
that his father was heterozygous for the D345H mutation and his mother
was heterozygous for the F350C mutation. Neither mutation was found in
100 ethnically matched controls.

In 3 Pakistani patients with retinitis pigmentosa-35 (610282) and 1 with
congenital blindness of uncertain phenotype, Abid et al. (2006)
identified heterozygosity for a G-to-A transition in codon 713 of exon
15 of the SEMA4A gene, resulting in an arg713-to-gln (R713Q)
substitution in the cytoplasmic tail. Sequence analysis of family
members of 1 of the RP patients confirmed that the R713Q mutation
segregated with the disease phenotype in an autosomal dominant mode of
inheritance, and the mutation was not found in 100 ethnically matched
controls.

;;ORTHODENTICLE, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, 3; OTX3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

OTX3 is a homeodomain transcription factor that is structurally and
functionally related to OTX1 (600036) and OTX2 (600037), both of which
are critical in brain morphogenesis.

CLONING

Zhang et al. (2002) cloned a full-length cDNA encoding Otx3 from a mouse
pancreatic beta cell (MIN6) cDNA library. The deduced 376-amino acid
protein shares 65% overall sequence identity with Otx1 and Otx2,
including a conserved lysine at amino acid 50 in the homeodomain.
However, it lacks the so-called OTX tail, a conserved motif of about 20
amino acids found in other Otx members. Zhang et al. (2002) cloned the
full-length human OTX3 homolog from a fetal brain cDNA library. The
deduced human protein shares approximately 94% sequence identity with
the mouse protein. Northern blot analysis of rat tissues detected a
single abundant transcript of 4.3 kb only in MIN6 and adult cerebellum.
RT-PCR with Otx3-specific primers demonstrated expression in adult
pancreatic islets. The Otx3 transcript was detected from 10.5 to 13.5
days postcoitum in mouse embryos, overlapping the temporal expression
pattern of Otx1 and Otx2. In situ hybridization studies demonstrated
that Otx3 expression is craniocaudally more restricted than that of Otx1
or Otx2, showing the most intense signal at the midbrain-hindbrain
boundary.

GENE FUNCTION

Using electophoretic mobility shift assays, Zhang et al. (2002) showed
that Otx3 specifically binds to the consensus sequence TAATCCC and thus
acts as a transcription factor. Cotransfection experiments with Otx3 and
Otx2 showed that Otx3 significantly suppressed Otx2-induced
transcription activity, suggesting that Otx3 functions as a
transcription repressor of Otx2 by acting competitively on the target
sequence.

ANIMAL MODEL

Ohtoshi and Behringer (2004) developed mice carrying Dmbx1 mutant
alleles. Some homozygous mutant mice died during the neonatal period,
while others survived to adulthood and were fertile, although their
growth was impaired. Both heterozygous and homozygous mutant offspring
from Dmbx1 homozygous mutant females exhibited a low survival rate and
poor growth, and even wildtype pups fostered onto Dmbx1 homozygous
mutant females grew poorly. The neonatal mortality and growth defect
were likely caused by an impaired milk ejection reflex in homozygous
mutant dams. Heterozygous mutant mice showed abnormal Dmbx1 expression
in the nervous system, suggesting abnormal brain development.

Fujimoto et al. (2007) found that Dmbx1 -/- mice exhibited severe
leanness associated with hypophagia and hyperactivity. Isolation of a
Dmbx1 -/- mouse from its cohabitants induced self-starvation, sometimes
leading to death, features similar to those of anorexia nervosa (see
606788) in humans. The findings suggested that Dmbx1 is involved in the
actions of Agrp (602311) in regulating energy homeostasis and behavior.
