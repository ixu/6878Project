REARRANGED IN THYROID ADENOMAS; RITA
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Zinc finger proteins have been shown to interact with nucleic acids and
to have diverse functions. The zinc finger domain is a conserved amino
acid sequence motif containing 2 specifically positioned cysteines and 2
histidines that are involved in coordinating zinc. Kruppel-related
proteins form one family of zinc finger proteins. See ZFP93 (604749) for
additional information on zinc finger proteins.

CLONING

Using a differential display/PCR method, Wu et al. (2001) identified a
novel Kruppel-related zinc finger gene, which they designated ZNF463,
encoding a 463-amino acid protein with an N-terminal KRAB domain and 12
C-terminal C2H2 zinc finger units. Northern blot analysis revealed
testis-restricted expression of a 1.9-kb ZNF463 transcript. RT-PCR
analysis demonstrated higher expression of ZNF463 in normal fertile
adults than in fetuses or patients with azoospermia, suggesting that
ZNF463 may play a role in spermatogenesis.

MAPPING

By FISH, Wu et al. (2001) mapped the ZNF463 gene to chromosome
19q13.3-q13.4. This localization is consistent with the finding of the
ZNF331 gene in the region of 19q13 breakpoints involved in follicular
adenomas of the thyroid gland (Rippe et al., 1999).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Translocations involving 19q13 are a frequent finding in follicular
adenomas of the thyroid and may represent the most frequent type of
structural aberration in human epithelial tumors (Belge et al., 1998).
By positional cloning of the 19q13 breakpoints found in follicular
adenomas of the thyroid gland, Rippe et al. (1999) identified a
candidate gene that they initially referred to as RITA (rearranged in
thyroid adenomas) and renamed ZNF331. Meiboom et al. (2003) reported
unique expression of a 3.4-kb ZNF331 transcript in thyroid adenoma cell
lines with 19q13 aberrations which was not detected either in normal
tissues or in thyroid carcinoma cell lines.

;;POTASSIUM CHANNEL, VOLTAGE-GATED, SUBFAMILY Q, MEMBER 2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The KCNQ2 gene encodes a voltage-gated potassium channel that is
expressed in the brain (Biervert et al., 1998).

CLONING

In the course of a search for the mutational basis of benign familial
neonatal seizures (BFNS1; 121200) mapping to chromosome 20, Singh et al.
(1998) identified a novel voltage-gated potassium channel gene that
showed significant homology to KVLQT1 (also known as KCNQ1 and KCNA9),
the chromosome 11 potassium channel gene responsible for long QT
syndrome-1 (192500) and a form of Jervell and Lange-Nielsen
cardioauditory syndrome (220400). A single cDNA isolated with the D20S24
probe in this region showed significant homology with KVLQT1. Singh et
al. (1998) found that the KCNQ2 cDNA hybridized to transcripts of
approximately 1.5, 3.8, and 9.5 kb on Northern blots made from brain.

By positional cloning from the 20q13.3 region where 1 form of benign
familial neonatal seizures is known to map, Biervert et al. (1998)
independently isolated the KCNQ2 gene and found that it was expressed in
brain.

Yang et al. (1998) described the cloning, tissue distribution, and
functional expression of KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 (602232), both of which are
associated with benign neonatal epilepsy. The deduced 871-amino acid
KCNQ2 protein has features of a voltage-gated potassium channel.
Northern blot analysis of 8 human tissues detected an 8.5-kb KCNQ2
transcript in brain only. Within brain, highest expression of KCNQ2 was
detected in cerebellar cortex, amygdala, caudate nucleus, and
hippocampus.

GENE STRUCTURE

Biervert and Steinlein (1999) determined that the KCNQ2 gene has at
least 18 exons, occupying more than 50 kb of genomic DNA. Splice
variants were identified. For example, in fetal brain, exon 8 was absent
in all transcripts, while this exon was present in clones derived from
adult brain RNA.

GENE FUNCTION

Biervert et al. (1998) found that expression of human KCNQ2 in Xenopus
laevis oocytes led to potassium-selective currents that activated slowly
with depolarization.

The M channel is a slowly activating and deactivating potassium
conductance that plays a critical role in determining the subthreshold
electroexcitability of neurons as well as the responsiveness to synaptic
inputs. The M current was first described in peripheral sympathetic
neurons, and differential expression of this conductance produces
subtypes of sympathetic neurons with distinct firing patterns. The M
channel is also expressed in many neurons in the central nervous system.
Wang et al. (1998) showed that the KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 channel subunits can
coassemble to form a channel with essentially identical biophysical
properties and pharmacologic sensitivities to the native M channel and
that the pattern of KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 gene expression is consistent with
these genes encoding the native M channel.

Yang et al. (1998) demonstrated that KCNQ2 and KCNQ3, both of which are
associated with benign neonatal epilepsy, interact functionally with
each other and with KCNE1 (176261), which is mutant in a form of Jervell
and Lange-Nielsen syndrome and in 1 form of long QT syndrome.

Cooper et al. (2000) provided information regarding the in vivo
distribution and biochemical characteristics of human brain KCNQ2 and
KCNQ3, the 2 channel subunits that form M channels when expressed in
vitro, and, when mutated, cause the dominantly inherited epileptic
syndrome, benign familial neonatal seizures. They found that the KCNQ2
and KCNQ3 proteins are colocalized in a somatodendritic pattern on
pyramidal and polymorphic neurons in the human cortex and hippocampus.
Immunoreactivity for KCNQ2, but not KCNQ3, is also prominent in some
terminal fields, suggesting a presynaptic role for a distinct subgroup
of M channels in the regulation of action potential propagation and
neurotransmitter release. KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 could be coimmunoprecipitated
from brain lysates. Further, both proteins were coassociated with
tubulin (see 602529) and protein kinase A (see 176911) within a triton
X-100-insoluble protein complex. Cooper et al. (2000) suggested that
these studies provided a view of a signaling complex that may be
important for cognitive function as well as epilepsy, and that analysis
of this complex may shed light on the transduction pathway linking
muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (see 118510) activation to M-channel
inhibition.

By recording channel currents produced in cRNA-injected Xenopus oocytes,
Zhang et al. (2003) found that phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate
(PIP2) activated all members of the KCNQ channel family analyzed,
including human KCNQ2 and heterodimers of human KCNQ2 and rat Kcnq3.
Similar results were obtained with mammalian cells expressing KCNQ2 and
Kcnq3. Mutation of his328-to-cys in KCNQ2 and his330-to-cys in Kcnq3
reduced or eliminated PIP2-mediated channel activation. Wortmannin, a
pharmacologic inhibitor of PIP2 regeneration, slowed the recovery from
PIP2 hydrolysis and decreased the sensitivity of the KCNQ2/Kcnq3 channel
to PIP2. Zhang et al. (2003) concluded that PIP2 acts as a
membrane-diffusible second messenger to regulate the activity of KCNQ
currents.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Benign Familial Neonatal Seizures 1

In affected members of a family with benign familial neonatal seizures-1
(BFNS1; 121200), Singh et al. (1998) identified a small deletion on
chromosome 20q encompassing the KCNQ2 gene. The finding was confirmed by
fluorescence in situ hybridization in an affected individual who
presented with seizures beginning at 3 days and had 118 generalized
seizures until the age of 23 days. A single seizure was observed at 3.5
months in conjunction with an acute infection of the middle ear with
fever, but no seizures were observed thereafter. Singh et al. (1998)
also identified different heterozygous mutations in the KCNQ2 gene (see,
e.g., 602235.0001 and 602235.0002) in additional families with BFNS1.

In a large pedigree with BFNS1, Biervert et al. (1998) found a 5-bp
insertion (602235.0003) that was predicted to delete more than 300 amino
acids from the C terminus of KCNQ2. Expression of the mutant channel did
not yield measurable currents. Thus, impairment of potassium-dependent
repolarization was indicated as the cause of this age-specific epileptic
syndrome.

Dedek et al. (2001) reported a Caucasian family in which BFNS was
followed later in life by myokymia, involuntary contractions of skeletal
muscles (see 121200). All affected members of the family carried an
arg207-to-trp mutation (R207W; 602235.0006) that neutralized a charged
amino acid in the S4 voltage-sensor segment of KCNQ2. This substitution
led to a shift of voltage-dependent activation of KCNQ2 and a dramatic
slowing of activation upon depolarization. Myokymia was thought to
result from hyperexcitability of the lower motoneuron; indeed both KCNQ2
and KCNQ3 mRNAs were detected in the anterior horn of the spinal cord
where the cells of the lower motoneurons arise. Dedek et al. (2001)
proposed that a difference in firing patterns between motoneurons and
central neurons, combined with the drastically slowed voltage activation
of the R207W mutant, explained by this particular KCNQ2 mutant caused
myokymia in addition to BFNC. Wuttke et al. (2007) identified a mutation
in the KCNQ2 gene (R207Q; 602235.0011) in a patient with isolated
myokymia.

Heron et al. (2007) identified 3 deletions and 1 duplication of more
than 1 exon of the KCNQ2 gene in 4 (44%) of 9 unrelated families with
benign familial neonatal seizures who had previously tested negative for
coding or splice site mutations. The changes were predicted to result in
haploinsufficiency. The authors suggested that multiplex
ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) should be a second-tier
testing strategy in candidate cases.

- Early Infantile Epileptic Encephalopathy 7

In a mother and son with severe epilepsy, Dedek et al. (2003) identified
a heterozygous mutation in the KCNQ2 gene (602235.0008). Both patients
had an atypical course characterized by drug-resistant seizures
necessitating ACTH treatment. In addition, the son developed early
infantile epileptic encephalopathy with delayed psychomotor development
(EIEE7; 613720). Functional expression studies showed that the S247W
mutation reduced channel currents by more than 50% in homomeric KCNQ2
channels. Dedek et al. (2003) emphasized that some KCNQ2 mutations may
be associated with a more severe phenotype than is typical for BFNC.

Weckhuysen et al. (2012) identified 7 different heterozygous mutations
in the KCNQ2 gene (see, e.g., 602235.0012-602235.0014) in 8 (10%) of 80
patients with neonatal or early infantile seizures and associated
psychomotor retardation. The mutations arose de novo in 7 cases; in 1
case, a severely affected patient inherited the mutation from her
father, who had a milder phenotype and was mosaic for the mutation. The
findings indicated that KCNQ2 mutations can occur in a substantial
proportion of patients with EIEE.

ANIMAL MODEL

The electroconvulsive threshold (ECT) test has been used extensively to
determine the protection conferred by antiepileptic drug candidates
against induced seizures in rodents. Yang et al. (2003) adopted the ECT
test to screen the progeny of ethylnitrosourea-treated male C57BL/6J
mice. In a small-scale screen, several mutant lines conferring a low
threshold to ECT minimal clonic seizures were mapped to the telomeric
region of mouse chromosome 2 in independent founder families. Genetic
and physical mapping data indicated that several lines shared a single
mutation, Szt1 (seizure threshold-1), consisting of a 300-kb deletion of
genomic DNA involving 3 known genes. Two of these genes, Kcnq2 and
Chrna4 (118504), are known to be mutated in human epilepsy families.
Szt1 homozygotes and heterozygotes displayed similar phenotypes to those
found in the respective Kcnq2 knockout mutant mice, suggesting that
Kcnq2 haploinsufficiency may lie at the root of the Szt1 seizure
sensitivity.

In affected members of a family with benign familial neonatal seizures
(121200), Singh et al. (1998) demonstrated a TAC-to-TGC transition
converting codon 284 from tyrosine to cysteine. The family was too small
to permit demonstration of linkage to chromosome 20. The mutation
occurred in the pore region of the channel.

In their BFNS kindred 1705, Singh et al. (1998) demonstrated that
individuals affected with benign familial neonatal seizures (121200) had
an ala306-to-thr (A306T) amino acid substitution in the S6 transmembrane
segment. This alanine residue was conserved in all members of the
Shaker, Shab, Shaw, and Shal subfamilies of potassium channels.

KCNQ2, 5-BP INS

Biervert et al. (1998) identified an insertional mutation in the KCNQ2
gene in a large Australian Caucasian pedigree with benign familial
neonatal seizures (121200) previously reported by Berkovic et al.
(1994). Biervert et al. (1998) found a heterozygous 5-bp insertion at
the triplet encoding amino acid 534 in a segment highly conserved
between KCNQ2 and KCNQ1 (607542), which is mutated in type 1 long QT
syndrome (192500). The resulting frameshift was predicted to cause a
premature stop, which would truncate more than 300 amino acids. Of 13
affected family members, 10 had known neonatal seizures. Two patients
had afebrile seizures later, 1 of whom did not have neonatal seizures.
One mutation carrier was unaffected, indicating reduced penetrance.
Berkovic et al. (1994) noted the phenotypic heterogeneity in this
family.

KCNQ2, 1-BP DEL, 1846T

In a patient with benign familial neonatal seizures (121200), Biervert
and Steinlein (1999) identified a 1-bp deletion, 1846delT, in the KCNQ2
gene which caused a frameshift in exon 16, removing 228 amino acids from
the predicted wildtype sequence and replacing them with a stretch of 283
amino acids showing a completely different sequence. The mutation was
also present in the DNA sample obtained from the father but not in that
from the mother. The paternal grandmother reportedly had also suffered
from neonatal seizures but was not available for study.

KCNQ2, ARG214TRP

In a 4-generation Italian family segregating benign familial neonatal
seizures (121200), del Giudice et al. (2000) identified a 686C-T
mutation in exon 3 of the KCNQ2 gene, resulting in an arg214-to-trp
substitution. The mutation was found in the 8 affected members of the
pedigree and in 1 unaffected subject who was an obligate carrier. The
mutation occurred in the transmembrane domain S4, neutralizing one of
the conserved, positively charged residues of that segment. The
substitution abolished an AgeI restriction site and was not detected in
150 Italian controls.

KCNQ2, ARG207TRP

In 5 affected members of a Caucasian family with BFNS and/or myokymia
(see 121200), Dedek et al. (2001) identified a heterozygous C-to-T
transition in exon 3 of the KCNQ2 gene, resulting in an arg207-to-trp
(R207W) substitution in the fourth transmembrane domain. Three mutation
carriers had BFNS with myokymia, 1 had isolated myokymia without
seizures, and 1 had neonatal seizures with no clinical signs of
myokymia, although electromyography demonstrated spontaneous discharges
of grouped motor unit potentials. In vitro functional expression studies
showed that the mutation resulted in a shift of voltage-dependent
activation of KCNQ2 and a dramatic slowing of activation upon
depolarization. The loss of potassium current was more severe compared
to other KCNQ2 mutations and showed a dominant-negative effect.

In a patient with isolated myokymia and no history of neonatal seizures,
Wuttke et al. (2007) identified an R207Q mutation (602235.0011) in the
same codon as the R207W mutation. In vitro functional expression studies
showed that mutant R207W and R207Q channels had large depolarizing
shifts and marked slowing of activation time compared to wildtype
channels. Coexpression with wildtype channels showed a dominant-negative
effect reducing the current amplitude by 70% after short depolarization.

KCNQ2, LYS526ASN

In 4 affected members of a family with BFNS1 (121200), Borgatti et al.
(2004) identified a heterozygous 1620G-A transition in the KCNQ2 gene,
resulting in a lys526-to-asn (K526N) substitution in the C-terminal
region of the protein. The mutation is located in a highly conserved
region within alpha-helix B that is necessary for calmodulin binding.
Functional expression studies showed that the K526N mutation decreased
the voltage-dependence of the channel. Although 2 patients had a
phenotype consistent with typical BFNS, the other 2 patients had a
complex phenotype that was atypical and severe, consistent with an
encephalopathy (EIEE7; 613720). One developed an extremely unfavorable
outcome, profound mental retardation, and spastic quadriparesis. The
other continued to have focal seizures until late infancy with a
moderate degree of mental retardation and a mild cerebellar syndrome.
Borgatti et al. (2004) noted that some patients with BFNS may experience
seizures later in life or a different set of epileptic subtypes
sometimes associated with severe neurologic and intellectual impairment.
Overall, the clinical, genetic, and functional data did not provide a
definitive explanation for the wide range of phenotypic variability
observed in the described family, therefore preventing
genotype-phenotype correlations. The authors postulated that the
phenotypic variability could be due to the interplay of pathogenic
mutations, modifier genes, and more subtle environmental factors.

KCNQ2, SER247TRP

In a mother and son with severe epilepsy, Dedek et al. (2003) identified
a heterozygous C-to-G transversion in exon 5 of the KCNQ2 gene,
resulting in a ser247-to-trp (S247W) substitution in the fifth
transmembrane residue of the protein. The mutation was not identified in
202 control chromosomes. Both patients had an atypical course
characterized by drug-resistant seizures necessitating ACTH treatment.
In addition, the son developed epileptic encephalopathy with delayed
psychomotor development (EIEE7; 613720). Functional expression studies
showed that the S247W mutation reduced channel currents by more than 50%
in homomeric KCNQ2 channels. Dedek et al. (2003) emphasized that some
KCNQ2 mutations may be associated with a more severe phenotype than is
typical for BFNS.

KCNQ2, 10-BP DEL/1-BP INS, NT761

In 9 affected members of a large Italian family with BFNS1 (121200),
Bassi et al. (2005) identified a heterozygous 10-bp deletion and 1-bp
insertion (761del10insA) in the KCNQ2 gene, resulting in a truncated
N-terminal peptide of 194 residues. The resultant mutant protein lacks
the S4 domain, which is critical for voltage sensing. In vitro
functional expression studies showed that the mutant KCNQ2 subunit was
unable to form functional homomeric potassium channels, suggesting
haploinsufficiency rather than a dominant-negative effect. One affected
family member developed severe epilepsy associated with mild mental
retardation and persistent neurologic problems in adult life (EIEE7;
613720); this phenotypic variability was considered by the authors to be
consistent with the fact that 10 to 15% of BFNS individuals experience
seizure manifestations later in life.

heterozygous 1-bp deletion (2127delT) in the last exon of the KCNQ2
gene, resulting in a replacement of the C terminus with 219 new amino
acids and a protein that is 56 residues longer than the wildtype

In a 25-year-old Egyptian man with isolated myokymia (see 121200),
Wuttke et al. (2007) identified a heterozygous G-to-A transition in the
KCNQ2 gene, resulting in an arg207-to-gln (R207Q) substitution in a
highly conserved residue in the voltage sensor region of the potassium
channel. He had no history of neonatal seizures and no family history of
epilepsy or peripheral nerve hyperexcitability. Clinically, he had
permanent muscle overactivity in the distal upper extremities and small
amplitude movements of the fingers, which were not disabling. However,
he also reported exercise-induced cramps of both hands since childhood
and 4 episodes of exercise-induced generalized muscle stiffness. EMG
showed spontaneous irregular discharges consistent with myokymia. Wuttke
et al. (2007) noted that a mutation in the same codon (R207W;
602235.0006) had been associated with neonatal epilepsy and/or myokymia.
In vitro functional expression studies showed that mutant R207W and
R207Q channels had large depolarizing shifts and marked slowing of
activation time compared to wildtype channels. Coexpression with
wildtype channels showed a dominant-negative effect reducing the current
amplitude by 70% after short depolarization.

arg213-to-gln (R213Q) substitution at a highly conserved residue in the
transmembrane domain. The mutation was not found in 276 control
individuals. The patient had onset of multiple daily seizures on the
second day of life, and the mother had noted jerking movements during
pregnancy. The patient had poor response to treatment, but the seizures
remitted at age 14 months. However, at age 2 years 10 months, she had
severe psychomotor retardation, could not roll over, was nonverbal, had
severe spastic quadriplegia, and some dysmorphic features. Her father,
who had benign neonatal seizures and myokymia, was mosaic for the
mutation, which was found in 30% of his lymphocytes.

resulting in a met546-to-val (M546V) substitution at a highly conserved
residue in one of the calmodulin binding domains in the C-terminal
region. The mutation was not found in 276 control individuals. On the
third day of life, the patient had onset of multiple daily tonic
seizures resistant to treatment and associated with a burst suppression
pattern on EEG that evolved into multifocal epileptic activity. Seizures
remitted at age 3 years and the EEG was normal at age 8. However, he had
psychomotor retardation, mild spasticity, widely spaced gait, and lack
of speech development. Brain imaging showed lesions in the basal ganglia
and a thin posterior corpus callosum.

age 3 years. EEG studies were abnormal at first, but normalized over
time. Both patients showed psychomotor retardation and were nonverbal.
One had axial hypotonia and widely spaced gait, whereas the other had
spastic quadriparesis.

606919	TITLE *606919 CERAMIDE SYNTHASE 1; CERS1
;;LAG1, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF, 1; LASS1;;
UPSTREAM OF GDF1; UOG1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Longevity assurance gene-1 (Lag1) is preferentially expressed in young
yeast, i.e., yeast cells that have undergone a small number of cell
divisions. By screening genomic and cDNA libraries using a yeast Lag1
probe and degenerate PCR primers, followed by database searching, Jiang
et al. (1998) identified a cDNA encoding LASS1. LASS1 had been
identified previously by Lee (1991), who designated it UOG1 for upstream
of GDF1 (602880). Lee (1991) showed that the potential 350-amino acid
human and mouse UOG1 proteins are 81% identical. Jiang et al. (1998)
determined that the deduced LASS1 protein contains a conserved
52-residue stretch termed the Lag1 motif, as well as a transmembrane
domain. Complementation analysis indicated that LASS1, but not a similar
gene, TRAM (605190), can replace yeast Lag1 in spite of limited amino
acid homology. Northern blot analysis revealed expression of a 3.0-kb
transcript in brain, skeletal muscle, and testis, as well as in
glioblastoma and neuroblastoma cell lines

GENE FUNCTION

Venkataraman et al. (2002) transiently transfected mouse Uog1 into human
embryonic kidney 293T cells and observed an increase in ceramide
synthesis which was resistant to fumonisin B1 inhibition. The ceramide
was subsequently preferentially channeled into neutral
glycosphingolipids but not into gangliosides. Electrospray tandem mass
spectrometry confirmed the elevation in sphingolipids and revealed that
the ceramides and neutral glycosphingolipids from Uog1-transfected cells
contained primarily stearic acid (C18). In vitro assays of
Uog1-transfected cells demonstrated elevated ceramide synthase activity
when stearoyl-CoA but not palmitoyl-CoA was used as substrate.
Venkataraman et al. (2002) suggested that UOG1 is involved in the
regulation of N-stearoyl-sphinganine (C18-(dihydro)ceramide) synthesis
in mammalian cells. They stated that this was the first demonstration
that cells can synthesize ceramides with a high degree of fatty acid
selectivity as a result of the increased expression of a single gene
product.

Koybasi et al. (2004) measured endogenous long-chain ceramides in 32
human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC; 275355) and 10
nonsquamous head and neck carcinoma tumor tissues and found that
C(18:0)-ceramide was selectively downregulated in the majority of HNSCC
tumor tissues but not in the nonsquamous tumor tissues or in adjacent
noncancerous tissues from HNSCC patients. Overexpression of LASS1 in an
HNSCC cell line resulted in a 2-fold increase in levels of
C(18:0)-ceramide to concentrations similar to those of normal head and
neck tissues and was associated with a 70 to 80% inhibition of cell
growth. Koybasi et al. (2004) concluded that LASS1 and C(18:0)-ceramide
have a biologic role in the regulation of growth of head and neck
squamous cell carcinomas.

GENE STRUCTURE

By PCR screening of a BAC library, Jiang et al. (1998) determined that
the LASS1 gene contains 8 exons and spans approximately 30 kb. The
translation start codon is in a GC-rich region. There are no TATA boxes.

MAPPING

Using FISH, Jiang et al. (1998) mapped the LASS1 gene to chromosome
19p12.

311850	TITLE *311850 PHOSPHORIBOSYLPYROPHOSPHATE SYNTHETASE I; PRPS1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase (PRPS; EC 2.7.6.1) catalyzes the
phosphoribosylation of ribose 5-phosphate to
5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate, which is necessary for the de novo and
salvage pathways of purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis (Roessler et al.,
1990). Three PRPS genes have been identified: the widely expressed PRPS1
and PRPS2 (311860) genes, which map to chromosome Xq22-q24 and Xp22,
respectively, and PRPS3 (PRPS1L1; 611566), which maps to chromosome 7
and appears to be transcribed only in testis (Becker, 2001).

CLONING

Roessler et al. (1990) isolated a partial clone corresponding to the
PRPS1 gene from a human lymphoblast cDNA library. The deduced PRPS1
protein has 318 amino acids and shares 95% amino acid homology with
PRPS2. Becker et al. (1990) also cloned the PRPS1 gene and detected a
2.3-kb mRNA transcript.

By Northern blot analysis using rat Prps1 as probe, Taira et al. (1989)
detected a 2.3-kb transcript in human adipose tissue, testis, and
placenta and in 2 human cell lines.

Kim et al. (2007) demonstrated that the PRPS1 amino acid sequence shows
an exceptionally high degree of conservation, with homologies greater
than 95% across different species from zebrafish to human.

GENE STRUCTURE

The PRPS1 gene spans over 30 kb and contains 7 exons (Becker, 2001).

MAPPING

By the Goss-Harris method, Becker et al. (1978) concluded that the order
of loci on chromosome Xq is G6PD (305900)--HPRT1
(308000)--PRPS1--alpha-GAL (GLA; 300644)--PGK1 (311800)--centromere.
Becker et al. (1979) assigned the PRPS1 locus to a position between the
GLA and HPRT1 loci, particularly close to the latter, and discussed the
functional significance of the proximity of the genes for their
biochemically related functions.

Becker et al. (1990) mapped PRPS1 to Xq22-q24 by a combination of in
situ hybridization and study of human/rodent somatic cell hybrids.

- Pseudogene

By in situ chromosomal hybridization, Becker et al. (1990) identified a
PRPS1-related gene or pseudogene (PRPS1L2) on chromosome 9q33-q34.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

De Brouwer et al. (2010) provided a review of the clinical and molecular
features of the 4 distinct syndromes caused by mutation in the PRPS1
gene: PRPS1 superactivity (300661), X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth
disease-5 (CMTX5; 311070), Arts syndrome (301835), and isolated X-linked
sensorineural deafness (304500). The neurologic phenotype in all 4
PRPS1-related disorders seems to result primarily from reduced levels of
GTP and possibly other purine nucleotides including ATP, suggesting that
these disorders belong to the same disease spectrum. Preliminary results
of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) supplementation in 2 Australian brothers
with Arts syndrome revealed some improvement of their condition,
suggesting that SAM supplementation could potentially alleviate some of
the symptoms of patients with PRPS1 spectrum diseases by replenishing
purine nucleotides.

- Phosphoribosylpyrophosphate Synthetase Superactivity

In patients with phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase superactivity
(300661), Roessler et al. (1991, 1993) and Becker et al. (1995)
identified mutations in the PRPS1 gene (311850.0001-311850.0008). All
patients except 1 had hyperuricemia, neurodevelopmental abnormalities,
and sensorineural deafness; the other patient had only hyperuricemia and
gout. Functional expression studies of all mutations showed that enzyme
overactivity was due to alteration of allosteric feedback mechanisms.

- Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease, X-linked Recessive, 5

In affected males with X-linked recessive Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease-5
(CMTX5; 311070), Kim et al. (2007) identified mutations in the PRPS1
gene (311850.0009; 311850.0010). The phenotype includes peripheral
neuropathy, sensorineural deafness, and visual impairment. Kim et al.
(2007) used a positional cloning technique and evaluation of candidate
genes known to be expressed in the cochlea to identify the PRPS1 gene
for study. The mutations were shown to result in decreased enzyme
activity; none of the affected individuals had increased uric acid or
gout. Kim et al. (2007) noted that both PRPS1 superactivity and CMT5X
phenotypes share neurologic features.

- Arts Syndrome

Arts syndrome (301835) is an X-linked disorder characterized by mental
retardation, early-onset hypotonia, ataxia, delayed motor development,
hearing impairment, and optic atrophy. Using oligonucleotide microarray
expression profiling of fibroblasts from 2 probands in a Dutch family
with Arts syndrome, de Brouwer et al. (2007) found reduced expression
levels of PRPS1. Sequencing of PRPS1 led to the identification of 2
different missense mutations: L152P (311850.0011) in the Dutch family
and Q133P (311850.0012) in the Australian family. Both mutations
resulted in a loss of PRPS1 activity, as was shown in silico by
molecular modeling and was shown in vitro by enzyme assays in
erythrocytes and fibroblasts from patients. This was in contrast to the
gain-of-function mutations in PRPS1 identified in PRPS-related gout. The
loss-of-function mutations of PRPS1 probably result in impaired purine
biosynthesis, which was supported by the undetectable hypoxanthine in
urine and the reduced uric acid levels in serum from patients. De
Brouwer et al. (2007) suggested that treatment with S-adenosylmethionine
(SAM) theoretically could have therapeutic efficacy to replenish low
levels of purine, and a clinical trial involving the 2 affected
Australian brothers was underway. De Brouwer et al. (2010) reported
preliminary results of the 2 Australian brothers with Arts syndrome.

- X-linked Deafness 1

In a large 5-generation Chinese family segregating X-linked nonsyndromic
hearing loss (NSHL) mapping to the DNF2 locus (DFNX1; 304500) on
chromosome Xq22, Liu et al. (2010) analyzed 14 candidate genes and
identified a missense mutation in the PRPS1 gene (D65N; 311850.0013)
that cosegregated with the phenotype. Analysis of the PRPS1 gene in a
British American DNF2 family, previously reported by Tyson et al.
(1996), revealed a different missense mutation (A87T; 311850.0014);
missense mutations were also detected in DFN2 families previously
reported by Manolis et al. (1999) and Cui et al. (2004) (311850.0015 and
311850.0016, respectively). Liu et al. (2010) stated that none of the
mutations were predicted to result in a major structural change in the
PRPS1 protein, which might explain why the disease phenotype was limited
to NSHL.

HISTORY

Wada et al. (1974) and Iinuma et al. (1975) reported a Japanese infant
with mental retardation, hypouricemia, megaloblastic changes in the bone
marrow, and orotic aciduria associated with erythrocyte PRPS deficiency.
Hypsarrhythmia was first observed at 10 months of age and markedly
improved with ACTH therapy concomitant with an increase in red cell PRPS
activity. However, studies in fibroblasts from this patient did not
confirm enzyme deficiency (Becker, 2001).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
PHOSPHORIBOSYLPYROPHOSPHATE SYNTHETASE SUPERACTIVITY
PRPS1, ASN113SER

In a boy with hyperuricemia, sensorineural deafness, ataxia, and
secondary renal insufficiency associated with PRPS1 superactivity
(300661) reported by Becker et al. (1986), Roessler et al. (1991, 1993)
identified a 341A-G transition in the PRPS1 gene, resulting in an
asn113-to-ser (N113S) substitution. Biochemical studies in fibroblasts
were consistent with PRPS superactivity and purine nucleotide
feedback-resistance. The nucleotide sequence of PRPS2 cDNA was normal.

By in vitro functional expression studies in E. coli, Becker et al.
(1995) demonstrated that the N113S mutation resulted in alteration of
the allosteric mechanisms regulating both enzyme inhibition by purine
nucleotides and activation by inorganic phosphate.

.0002
PHOSPHORIBOSYLPYROPHOSPHATE SYNTHETASE SUPERACTIVITY
PRPS1, ASP182HIS

In a boy with hyperuricemia, mental retardation, and sensorineural
deafness associated with PRPS1 superactivity (300661) reported by Becker
et al. (1980), Roessler et al. (1991, 1993) identified a 547C-G
transversion in the PRPS1 gene, resulting in an asp182-to-his (D182H)
substitution. His affected mother had gout, uric acid urolithiasis, and
significant hearing loss. The nucleotide sequence of PRPS2 cDNA was
normal. Fibroblast studies of this patient and his mother (Becker et
al., 1980) indicated that the mutant enzyme had both regulatory and
catalytic defects. The enzyme showed 4- to 5-fold greater than normal
resistance to feedback inhibition and, in addition, increased maximal
velocity of the enzyme reaction. The son was hemizygous, and his mother
heterozygous, for the defect.

By in vitro functional expression studies in E. coli, Becker et al.
(1995) demonstrated that the D182H mutation resulted in alteration of
the allosteric mechanisms regulating both enzyme inhibition by purine
nucleotides and activation by inorganic phosphate.

.0003
PHOSPHORIBOSYLPYROPHOSPHATE SYNTHETASE SUPERACTIVITY
PRPS1, ASP51HIS

In a man with gout due to PRPS1 superactivity (300661) resulting from
purine nucleotide feedback-resistance (Zoref et al., 1975), Becker et
al. (1995) identified a 154G-C transversion in the PRPS1 gene, resulting
in an asp51-to-his (D51H) substitution. The patient had recurrent uric
acid lithiasis since age 14 years and severe gouty arthritis since age
20 years. His mother had increased uric acid excretion. In vitro
functional expression studies in E. coli demonstrated that the D51H
mutation resulted in alteration of the allosteric mechanisms regulating
both enzyme inhibition by purine nucleotides and activation by inorganic
phosphate.

(1995) identified a 385C-A transversion in the PRPS1 gene, resulting in
a leu128-to-ile (L128I) substitution. In vitro functional expression

(1995) identified a 569C-T transition in the PRPS1 gene, resulting in an
ala189-to-val (A189V) substitution. In vitro functional expression
studies in E. coli demonstrated that the A189V mutation resulted in
alteration of the allosteric mechanisms regulating both enzyme
inhibition by purine nucleotides and activation by inorganic phosphate.

PRPS1, HIS192GLN

In a boy with hyperuricemia, mental retardation, and sensorineural

(1995) identified a 579C-G transversion in the PRPS1 gene, resulting in
a his192-to-gln (H192Q) substitution. In vitro functional expression
studies in E. coli demonstrated that the H192Q mutation resulted in
alteration of the allosteric mechanisms regulating both enzyme
inhibition by purine nucleotides and activation by inorganic phosphate.

CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, X-LINKED RECESSIVE, 5
PRPS1, GLU43ASP

In 2 affected brothers with X-linked recessive Charcot-Marie-Tooth
disease-5 (311070), Kim et al. (2007) identified a 129A-C transversion
in exon 2 of the PRPS1 gene, resulting in a glu43-to-asp (E43D)
substitution on the 'flag' region of the N-terminal domain. The affected
residue is highly conserved from zebrafish to human, and the mutation
was not observed in 50 unrelated Caucasian individuals or in 1,103
Korean control chromosomes. None of the affected individuals had
increased uric acid production or gout.

.0010
CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, X-LINKED RECESSIVE, 5
PRPS1, MET115THR

In affected members of a Korean family with CMTX5 (311070), Kim et al.
(2007) identified a 344T-C transition in exon 3 of the PRPS1 gene,
resulting in a met115-to-thr (M115T) substitution in the alpha-helix of
the N-terminal domain. The affected residue is highly conserved from
zebrafish to human, and the mutation was not observed in 1,103 Korean
control chromosomes. In vitro functional expression studies showed that
the M115T mutation resulted in partial loss of enzyme function. None of
the affected individuals had increased uric acid production or gout.

ARTS SYNDROME
PRPS1, LEU152PRO

In a Dutch family with Arts syndrome (301835) originally reported by
Arts et al. (1993), de Brouwer et al. (2007) found that the disorder was
associated with a 455T-C transition in exon 4 of the PRPS1 gene that
resulted in a leu152-to-pro (L152P) substitution.

.0012
ARTS SYNDROME
PRPS1, GLN133PRO

In an Australian family with Arts syndrome (301835), de Brouwer et al.
(2007) found that the disorder was caused by a 398A-C transversion in
exon 3 of the PRPS1 gene that resulted in a gln133-to-pro (Q133P)
substitution. Enzyme assays and molecular modeling demonstrated loss of
function of the mutant protein.

DEAFNESS, X-LINKED 1
PRPS1, ASP65ASN

In affected members of a large 5-generation Chinese family segregating
X-linked deafness-1 (304500), Liu et al. (2010) identified a 193G-A
transition in exon 2 of the PRPS1 gene, resulting in an asp65-to-asn
(D65N) substitution at a highly conserved residue in the alpha helix at
the N terminus. The mutation was not found in 1,025 ethnically matched
control chromosomes. Enzymatic activity assays showed reductions of
PRPS1 activity in patient erythrocytes of approximately 40 to 70% and in
patient fibroblasts of approximately 50 to 60% compared to controls.

PRPS1, ALA87THR

In affected members of a British American family segregating X-linked
deafness-1 (304500), previously reported by Tyson et al. (1996), Liu et
al. (2010) identified a 259G-A transition in exon 2 of the PRPS1 gene,
resulting in an ala87-to-thr (A87T) substitution at a highly conserved
residue. The mutation was not found in 1,475 Chinese control chromosomes
or 450 chromosomes of European descent.

DEAFNESS, X-LINKED 1
PRPS1, GLY306ARG

In affected members of an American family segregating X-linked
deafness-1 (304500), previously reported by Manolis et al. (1999), Liu
et al. (2010) identified a 916G-A transition in exon 7 of the PRPS1
gene, resulting in a gly306-to-arg (G306R) substitution at a highly
conserved residue. The mutation was not found in 1,475 Chinese control
chromosomes or 450 chromosomes of European descent.

PRPS1, ILE290THR

In affected members from a Chinese family segregating X-linked
postlingual nonsyndromic hearing loss (DFNX1; 304500), previously
reported by Cui et al. (2004), Liu et al. (2010) identified an 869T-C
transition in exon 7 of the PRPS1 gene, resulting in an ile290-to-thr
(I290T) substitution at a highly conserved residue. The mutation was not
found in 1,025 ethnically matched control chromosomes.

ARTS SYNDROME AND PHOSPHORIBOSYLPYROPHOSPHATE SYNTHETASE SUPERACTIVITY
PRPS1, VAL142LEU

In a boy with a complex phenotype comprising Arts syndrome and PRPS1
superactivity (see 301835), Moran et al. (2012) identified a 424G-C
transversion in exon 4 of the PRPS1 gene, resulting in a val142-to-leu
(V142L) substitution at a highly conserved residue. Both the mother and
grandmother were heterozygous for the mutation, which was not found in
202 control alleles. The patient had developmental delay, hypotonia,
areflexia, motor neuropathy, sensorineural hearing loss, and a Chiari I
malformation. Laboratory studies showed increased serum uric acid and
increased urinary hypoxanthine consistent with PRPS1 superactivity, but
he did not have gout. In addition, he had recurrent infections and early
death at age 27 months from infection, consistent with Arts syndrome. A
maternal uncle with similar symptoms had died of pneumonia at age 2.
Molecular modeling predicted that the substitution would disrupt
allosteric sites involved in inhibition of PRPS1, resulting in a gain of
enzyme function, and the ATP-binding site, resulting in a loss of enzyme
function. Patient fibroblasts showed normal PRPP synthetase activity,
whereas erythrocytes showed a loss of enzyme activity, suggesting that
the effect of the V142L mutation on protein activity depends on cell
type. Moran et al. (2012) postulated a gain-of-function effect in
proliferating cells and a loss-of-function effect in postmitotic cells.
The report indicated that PRPS1 missense mutations can cause a
continuous spectrum of features ranging from progressive nonsyndromic
postlingual hearing impairment to uric acid overproduction, neuropathy,
and recurrent infections depending on the functional sites affected.

615101	TITLE *615101 TUBULIN, BETA-2A; TUBB2A
;;TUBULIN, BETA, CLASS IIA
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Microtubules are dynamic polymeric structures consisting of heterodimers
of alpha-tubulins (see 602529) and beta-tubulins, such as TUBB2A, that
are continuously incorporated and released. Microtubules function in
mitosis, intracellular transport, neuron morphology, and ciliary and
flagellar motility (Leandro-Garcia et al., 2010).

CLONING

Using database analysis, Leandro-Garcia et al. (2010) identified 8 major
beta-tubulins, including TUBB2A. Quantitative RT-PCR of 21 normal human
tissues detected highest TUBB2A expression in brain, where it
represented 30% of all beta-tubulins, followed by pancreas, liver, small
intestine, breast, kidney, prostate, and placenta. Abnormal TUBB2A
expression was detected in several tumor tissues compared with their
normal counterparts, with significantly decreased TUBB2A expression in
breast tumors compared with normal breast tissue.

MAPPING

Hartz (2013) mapped the TUBB2A gene to chromosome 6p25.2 based on an
alignment of the TUBB2A sequence (GenBank GENBANK X79535) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37). The TUBB2B gene (612850), a nearly identical
copy of TUBB2A, maps 70 kb centromeric to the TUBB2A gene on chromosome
6p25.2.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Leandro-Garcia et al. (2012) found a 63-fold variation in TUBB2A mRNA
content among lymphocytes from 100 normal individuals. Similar
variability was found in TUBB2A protein expression. They identified 3
SNPs in the TUBB2A promoter, -101T-C (dbSNP rs909964), -112A-G (dbSNP
rs909965), and -157A-G (dbSNP rs9501929), that correlated with high
TUBB2A mRNA expression. The -101T-C and -112A-G SNPs were in total
linkage disequilibrium, whereas -157A-G was independent of the other 2
SNPs. Lymphocytes simultaneously carrying -101C/-112G and -157G showed
highest TUBB2A expression. The -101C/-112G variant, but not the -157G
variant, showed significantly increased transcription rate in
luceriferase assays. Elevated TUBB2A expression and presence of
-101C/-112G correlated with reduced sensitivity to paclitaxel, a
proapoptotic chemotherapeutic agent that disrupts mitotic spindle
formation.

136820	TITLE *136820 FUCOSIDASE, ALPHA-L, 2; FUCA2
;;ALPHA-L-FUCOSIDASE 2;;
FUCOSIDASE, ALPHA-L, PLASMA
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Fucosylated proteins are involved in a variety of processes, including
immune response, signal transduction, embryogenesis and development,
apoptosis, adhesion, and extravasation of leukocytes.
Alpha-L-fucosidases (EC 3.2.1.51), such as FUCA2, are exoglycosidases
that catalyze the removal of terminal L-fucose residues linked via
alpha-1,2, alpha-1,3, alpha-1,4, or alpha-1,6 to the reducing end of
N-acetyl glucosamine of oligosaccharide chains. Alpha-L-fucosidases may
also have transglycosylation properties (summary by Intra et al., 2007).

CLONING

By database analysis, Intra et al. (2007) identified orthologs of FUCA2
in a variety of organisms, including bacteria, fungi, invertebrates,
birds, and mammals. The deduced 467-amino acid human FUCA2 protein
contains an N-terminal signal sequence followed by a catalytic domain.
FUCA2 may also have 2 transmembrane helices that are not well conserved.

GENE FUNCTION

By coculturing Helicobacter pylori (see 600263) with gastric cancer
(613659) cells, Liu et al. (2009) found that FUCA2 was secreted by
infected cells and was key to the transfer of L-fucose from the surface
of gastric cancer cells to clinical strains of H. pylori. Depletion of
FUCA2 by RNA interference showed that the enzyme was essential for H.
pylori adhesion to gastric cancer cells, particularly by gastric cancer-
and duodenal ulcer-specific strains. FUCA2 also enhanced expression of
Lewis x antigen (see 602030) in H. pylori. Liu et al. (2009) concluded
that there is an important connection between FUCA2 and the adhesion,
growth, and pathogenicity of H. pylori and suggested that FUCA2 is a
potential target for clinical diagnosis and therapy of H. pylori-related
diseases.

GENE STRUCTURE

Intra et al. (2007) determined that the FUCA2 gene contains 7 exons and
spans 16.9 kb.

MAPPING

Alpha-L-fucosidase-2 is coded by a gene linked to plasminogen (PLG;
173350). Eiberg and Mohr (1984) found, for the PLG:FUCA2 linkage, a lod
score of 7.37 at theta = 0.10 for males and 4.64 at 0.19 for females.
Eiberg et al. (1984) found a lod score of 7.37 at theta = 0.12 in males
for linkage of FUCA2 and PLG. Linkage of PLG with GC (and therefore
location on chromosome 4) was suggested by a lod score of 2.35 at theta
= 0.30 in males. However, once the plasminogen locus was found to be on
chromosome 6, FUCA2 could be assigned to chromosome 6 also.

Hartz (2011) mapped the FUCA2 gene to chromosome 6q24.2 based on an
alignment of the FUCA2 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK075458) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

HISTORY

The FUCA2 locus regulates the level of alpha-fucosidase in plasma (Ng et
al., 1976) and fibroblasts (Van Elsen et al., 1983), but not in
leukocytes. Wood (1979) suggested that the frequency of low plasma
fucosidase (62%) makes it a useful marker in linkage studies. Wood
(1977) argued that plasma and leukocyte alpha-L-fucosidases are under
the same genetic control and that the electrophoretic polymorphism of
the enzyme in leukocytes and the enzyme in fucosidosis is determined by
mutations at the same locus. In fucosidosis, deficiency of
alpha-L-fucosidase is found in both plasma and leukocytes. Normal
individuals with low plasma enzyme but normal leukocyte enzyme were
described by Ng et al. (1976); however, plasma enzyme is different
electrophoretically from leukocyte enzyme. The level of plasma
fucosidase could be explained on the basis of 2 alleles leading to three
phenotypes of high, intermediate, and low enzyme levels.

Low activity of alpha-L-fucosidase in the plasma is found in about 10%
of persons (Ng et al., 1976; Playfer and Evans, 1976; Gatti et al.,
1979) and is genetically determined. The frequency distribution of
plasma fucosidase activity in the population shows bimodality with 1
group consisting of persons with low activity thought to be due to
homozygosity for a recessive gene and a second larger group consisting
of heterozygotes and normal homozygotes. Complex segregation analysis
supported this interpretation (Iselius et al., 1982). Van Elsen et al.
(1983) showed that this polymorphism is not limited to plasma but is
found also in cultured fibroblasts.

;;NG20, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Xu and Dahlback (1999) identified APOM through N-terminal sequencing of
proteins associated with triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TGRLP). By
searching 2 liver cDNA libraries with probes designed from an EST
containing the sequence, they cloned human APOM. The deduced 188-amino
acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of about 21 kD. It contains
a potential N-glycosylation site, 2 possible disulfide bridges, and a
hydrophobic alpha-helical signal peptide that is retained in the mature
protein. Sequence analysis revealed 79% identity between the human and
mouse proteins. Northern blot analysis by Xu and Dahlback (1999)
detected restricted expression of a 750-bp transcript in liver and
kidney. Northern blot analysis of several cell lines by Albertella et
al. (1996) detected a 1.1-kb transcript in HepG2 liver cells but not in
human fibroblast, leukocyte, or monocytic cell lines. By Western blot
analysis, Xu and Dahlback (1999) found that APOM is a minor component of
high and low density lipoproteins as well as TGRLP. In vitro translation
in the presence of microsomes resulted in a protein of 26 kD, suggesting
that APOM is translocated through the membrane and glycosylated.

GENE STRUCTURE

By Southern blot analysis, Albertella et al. (1996) determined that APOM
is present in single copy in the genome.

MAPPING

By homology with the corresponding mouse gene, Ng20, which maps to
chromosome 17, and by sequence analysis, Xu and Dahlback (1999) mapped
the human APOM gene to chromosome 6p21.3, between the BAT3 (142590) and
BAT4 (142610) genes.

ANIMAL MODEL

Wolfrum et al. (2005) demonstrated that mice deficient in Apom
accumulated cholesterol in large HDL particles while the conversion of
HDL to pre-beta-HDL was impaired, leading to a markedly reduced
cholesterol efflux from macrophages to Apom-deficient HDL compared to
normal HDL in vitro. Overexpression of Apom in low density lipoprotein
receptor (LDLR; 606945)-null mice protected against atherosclerosis when
the mice were challenged with a cholesterol-enriched diet. Wolfrum et
al. (2005) concluded that APOM is important for the formation of
pre-beta-HDL and cholesterol efflux to HDL, and thereby inhibits
formation of atherosclerotic lesions.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Krainer et al. (1991) described a protein in HeLa cells that was
copurified with the pre-mRNA splicing factor SF2 (600812). They cloned a
cDNA that encoded the protein, which contains arginine-serine dipeptide
(RS) domains similar to those found in the U1 SnRNP 70-kD polypeptide.
The cDNA sequence was identical to one described by Honore et al.
(1993), who also cloned an additional 5-prime end sequence. The gene
encodes a 282-amino acid proprotein and is posttranslationally processed
by removal of the first 73 residues to a final 209-amino acid product.

Deb and Datta (1996) reported the cloning of a partial cDNA for a 34-kD
hyaluronic acid-binding protein. That protein is present normally as a
68-kD homodimer. Antibodies raised against it were used for
immunoscreening of an expression cDNA library of human skin fibroblasts.
The cDNA sequence was identical to the splicing factor obtained by
Krainer et al. (1991) and Honore et al. (1993). The predicted protein is
highly acidic (estimated pI of 4.04) and contains a hyaluronic
acid-binding domain as found in a protein called hyaladherin (107269).
The protein contains a potential tyrosine sulfation site, 3 predicted
N-linked glycosylation sites, and at least 1 potential phosphorylation
site for kinases like ERK (see 176948), CDC2 (116940), and casein kinase
II (115440). The recombinant protein, expressed in E. coli, was shown to
bind hyaluronic acid-Sepharose.

The functions of C1q, the recognition subunit of the first component of
the classical pathway of complement activation, are regulated by 2
distinct types of proteins that bind either the collagen or the globular
domain. From a B-cell library, Ghebrehiwet et al. (1994) cloned the cDNA
for the protein that binds the globular domain and established its
primary structure. The protein, designated C1QBP, is identical to HABP1.

GENE FUNCTION

Zheng et al. (2003) noted that replication of human immunodeficiency
virus-1 (HIV-1) is blocked in mouse cells at the levels of entry,
transcription, and assembly, with the latter effect possibly resulting
from excessive splicing of HIV-1 transcripts. They determined that
transfection of human C1QBP, but not mouse C1qbp, which they called p32,
blocked excessive splicing of viral genomic RNA. Mouse C1qbp has
aspartic acid at position 35 of the mature processed protein, whereas
human C1QBP has glycine at this position. Zheng et al. (2003) showed
that the aspartic acid in mouse C1qbp is responsible for the
posttranscriptional block to HIV replication.

Lamellipodia formation initiates directed cell migration by providing
temporary focal adhesion sites for cells to move themselves toward a
chemical signal. Using immunofluorescence microscopy and Western blot
analysis, Kim et al. (2011) demonstrated that gC1QR was concentrated in
lamellipodia together with CD44 (107269), monosialoganglioside, actin,
and phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase (FAK, or PTK2; 600758) in human
A549 lung carcinoma cells stimulated with insulin, IGF1 (147440), EGF
(131530), or serum. A549 cells depleted of gC1QR showed decreased
lamellipodia formation, FAK activation, and proliferation in response to
growth factors. In grafted mice, A549 cells depleted of gC1QR had
reduced tumorigenic and metatstatic activity. Kim et al. (2011)
concluded that cell surface gC1QR regulates lamellipodia formation and
metastasis through receptor tyrosine kinase activation.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), Majumdar and Datta (1998)
mapped the human HABP1 gene to 17p13-p12. By the same method, Guo et al.
(1997) mapped the C1QBP gene to 17p13.3 in a region conserved with mouse
chromosome 11.

606759	TITLE *606759 DUAL OXIDASE 2; DUOX2
;;THYROID OXIDASE 2; THOX2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The synthesis of thyroid hormone is catalyzed by a protein complex
located at the apical membrane of thyroid follicular cells. Contained
within this complex is an iodide transporter (605646), thyroperoxidase
(TPO; 274500), and a peroxide-generating system that includes DUOX1
(606758) and DUOX2 (De Deken et al., 2000).

CLONING

Using a probe for a leukocyte NADPH oxidase, De Deken et al. (2000)
cloned a DUOX2 cDNA from a primary human thyroid cell cDNA library. The
deduced 1,548-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 177
kD. It contains several domains characteristic of flavoproteins
including NADPH- and FAD-binding domains, and 4 specific histidines and
a conserved arginine predicted to bind a heme prosthetic group. DUOX2
also contains 2 EF-hand motifs, 4 putative N-glycosylation sites, and 7
hydrophobic stretches. It shares 83% and 47% sequence similarity with
DUOX1 and gp91-phox (300481), respectively, and significant similarity
to other NADPH oxidases. DUOX1 and DUOX2 share 53% and 61% sequence
similarity, respectively, with a predicted protein in C. elegans.
Northern blot analysis detected a 6.4-kb DUOX2 transcript in cultured
human thymocytes. Immunolocalization studies demonstrated that DUOX2
colocalizes with thyroperoxidase at the supranuclear apical pole of all
thyroid cells.

GENE FUNCTION

De Deken et al. (2000) demonstrated upregulated expression of DUOX1 and
DUOX2 mRNA in cultured human thymocytes stimulated with cAMP agonists.
In a study of thyroid carcinomas, Lacroix et al. (2001) showed that
levels of DUOX1 and DUOX2 were maintained in parallel and were more
frequently seen in neoplastic tissues expressing other thyroid
differentiation markers.

Caillou et al. (2001) investigated the gene and protein expression of
DUOX1 and DUOX2 in normal and pathologic human thyroid tissues using
real-time kinetic quantitative PCR and antipeptide antibodies,
respectively. In normal tissue, DUOX1 and DUOX2 localized at the apical
pole of thyrocytes. Immunostaining for DUOX1 and DUOX2 was
heterogeneous, inside a given follicle, with 40 to 60% of positive
follicular cells. Among normal and pathologic tissues, variations of
DUOX1 and DUOX2 mRNA levels were parallel, suggesting a similar
regulation of both gene expressions. The authors concluded that DUOX
proteins are apical glycoproteins with a regulation of expression that
differs from that of other thyroid markers. Because DUOX1 and DUOX2 are
not absolutely thyroid-specific, and because they constitute a novel
family of long homologs of the NOX flavoproteins and were predicted to
form a part of NADPH:O(2)-oxidoreductase systems, Caillou et al. (2001)
referred to the DUOX proteins as LNOX (for 'long NOX') 1 and 2.

DUOX2 is a component of the thyroid H2O2 generator crucial for hormone
synthesis at the apical membrane. By transfection in HeLa cells,
Grasberger and Refetoff (2006) found that coexpression of DUOX2 and
DUOXA2 (612772), but not expression of DUOX2 alone, was required for
plasma membrane localization of DUOX2 and H2O2 generation. H2O2 release
triggered by DUOX2/DUOXA2 cotransfection was completely blocked by the
flavoprotein inhibitor DPI.

Niethammer et al. (2009) probed the role of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)
during the early events of wound responses in zebrafish larvae
expressing the genetically encoded H2O2 sensor. This reporter revealed a
sustained rise in H2O2 concentration at the wound margin, starting
approximately 3 minutes after wounding and peaking at approximately 20
minutes, which extended 100 to 200 microns into the tail fin epithelium
as a decreasing concentration gradient. Using pharmacologic and genetic
inhibition, they showed that this gradient is created by dual oxidase
(Duox1, 606758 and Duox2) and that it is required for rapid requirement
of leukocytes to the wound. Niethammer et al. (2009) concluded that this
was the first observation of a tissue-scale H2O2 pattern, and the first
evidence that H2O2 signals to leukocytes in tissues, in addition to its
known antiseptic role.

MAPPING

By FISH, Dupuy et al. (1999) mapped the DUOX2 gene to chromosome 15q15.
By radiation hybrid analysis, De Deken et al. (2000) colocalized the
DUOX2 and DUOX1 genes on 15q15.3.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Moreno et al. (2002) studied the thyroid oxidase system in 9 patients
with idiopathic congenital hypothyroidism (1 with permanent and 8 with
transient hypothyroidism) and an iodide organification defect (607200)
who had been identified by the screening program for congenital
hypothyroidism. The DNA of the patients and their relatives was analyzed
for mutations in the genes for DUOX1 and DUOX2. One patient with
permanent and severe thyroid hormone deficiency and a complete iodide
organification defect had a homozygous nonsense mutation (606759.0001)
in the DUOX2 gene that eliminated all functional domains of the protein.
Three of the 8 patients with mild transient congenital hypothyroidism
and a partial iodide organification defect had heterozygous mutations in
the DUOX2 gene that prematurely truncated the protein, thus abolishing
its functional domains. Moreno et al. (2002) observed that monoallelic
mutations, associated with mild, transient hypothyroidism, resulted in
insufficient thyroid production of hydrogen peroxide, which prevented
the synthesis of sufficiently large quantities of thyroid hormones
required at the beginning of life.

EVOLUTION

Grasberger and Refetoff (2006) found that the DUOX/DUOXA arrangement is
highly conserved. The bidirectional association of Duox and Duoxa
emerged before the divergence of echinoderms. Teleosts have single
copies of the Duox and Duoxa genes, and these underwent tandem
duplication to an inverted repeat (Duox2/Duoxa2/Duoxa1 (612771)/Duox1)
in vertebrates before the amphibian divergence.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
THYROID DYSHORMONOGENESIS 6
DUOX2, ARG434TER

In a patient with congenital hypothyroidism (TDH6; 607200) detected in
neonatal screening, Moreno et al. (2002) discovered homozygosity for a
1300C-T transition in the DUOX2 gene, resulting in an arg434-to-ter
(R434X) mutation that truncated the protein. The patient had thyroxine
levels below the limit of detection and very high thyrotropin levels.
Subsequent diagnostic procedures showed a properly located gland with a
high uptake of iodine-123 and complete discharge of iodide in the
perchlorate test. The patient required continued thyroid hormone
therapy. The patient was the product of a consanguineous marriage. The
father, mother, and brother were heterozygous for the mutation and had
normal thyroid function.

.0002
THYROID DYSHORMONOGENESIS 6
DUOX2, GLN686TER

In a patient with congenital hypothyroidism (TDH6; 607200) detected in
newborn screening and showing mildly decreased thyroxine and elevated
thyrotropin levels, Moreno et al. (2002) identified a 2056C-T transition
resulting in a gln686-to-ter (Q686X) mutation. After several adjustments
in dosage, the patient was given very low doses of thyroxine, and after
the age of 3 years therapy was stopped for diagnostic purposes. The
patient remained euthyroid during the follow-up of 12 months. Whereas a
patient with permanent hypothyroidism was homozygous for a DUOX2
mutation (606759.0001), the patient with the 2056C-T mutant DUOX2 allele
was heterozygous, as was the father; the mother was homozygous wildtype.

.0003
THYROID DYSHORMONOGENESIS 6
DUOX2, ARG842TER

In 2 brothers with congenital hypothyroidism (TDH6; 607200), Vigone et
al. (2005) identified compound heterozygosity for a 2524C-T transition
in exon 18 of the DUOX2 gene, resulting in an arg842-to-ter (R842X)
substitution, and a 1126C-T transition in exon 9 of the DUOX2 gene,
resulting in an arg376-to-trp (R376W) substitution (606759.0004). The
euthyroid parents were heterozygotes, the mother for R842X and the
father for R376W.

GERM CELL TUMOR 1; GCT1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using combined comparative genomic hybridization and expression EST
array analysis to identify genes in a region of chromosome 12 amplified
in seminomas and in an ovarian carcinoma cell line compared with normal
tissue, Bourdon et al. (2002) identified ASUN, which they designated
GCT1. RT-PCR detected ASUN expression in all 16 normal human tissues
examined. Expression of ASUN was elevated in a majority of seminomas
compared with normal testis.

By searching databases, Anderson et al. (2009) identified ASUN orthologs
in Drosophila and C. elegans. In flies, Asun expression appeared to be
germline specific.

GENE FUNCTION

Lee et al. (2005) found that knockdown of Mat89bb disrupted the rapid S
phase-M phase cycling characteristic of early Drosophila and Xenopus
embryos. In HeLa cells, knockdown of MAT89BB disrupted a later stage of
mitosis and resulted in multinucleated cells.

Jodoin et al. (2012) found that knockdown of ASUN in human cell lines
reduced perinuclear localization of dynein (see 600112), which is
essential for proper tethering of centrosomes to the nuclear envelope at
G2/M. Consequently, knockdown of ASUN led to mitotic defects, including
nucleus-centrosome uncoupling, abnormal spindles, and multinucleated
cells. Knockdown of ASUN also resulted in mislocalization of the dynein
adaptor LIS1 (PAFAH1B1; 607432). Coimmunoprecipitation analysis showed
that ASUN interacted directly with LIS1, but not with dynein, and
mediated perinuclear enrichment of LIS1 at G2/M.

GENE STRUCTURE

Bourdon et al. (2002) determined that the ASUN gene contains 17 exons
and spans about 32.8 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Bourdon et al. (2002) mapped the ASUN gene
to chromosome 12p12-p11.

ANIMAL MODEL

Anderson et al. (2009) found that knockout of Asun in Drosophila caused
a defect in spermatogenesis, with spermatocyte arrest during prophase of
meiosis I and defects in nucleus-centrosome coupling. Spermatocytes that
overcame arrest exhibited defects in meiotic spindle assembly,
chromosome segregation, and cytokinesis. In Asun mutant spermatocytes
and spermatids, dynein-dynactin (see 601143) complexes, which mediate
nucleus-centrosome/basal body interactions, failed to localize to the
nuclear surface.

Jodoin et al. (2012) found that germline expression of mouse Asun
rescued sterility and dynein mislocalization in Asun mutant flies.

;;NAV1.4
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Wang et al. (1992) deduced the amino acid sequence of the SCN4A gene
from adult human skeletal muscle by cross-species PCR-mediated cloning
and sequencing of the cDNA. The protein consists of 1,836 residues and
shows 93% sequence identity to the alpha subunit from rat adult skeletal
muscle and 70% identity to the alpha subunit from other mammalian
tissues. Similar results were reported by George et al. (1992).

GENE STRUCTURE

McClatchey et al. (1992) and George et al. (1993) determined that the
SCN4A gene contains 24 exons.

MAPPING

Fontaine et al. (1990) cloned portions of the adult SCN4A gene and
localized it to chromosome 17 using somatic cell hybrids. One of the
probes used in this study showed hybridization also to chromosome 3,
probably indicating cross-hybridization with the fetal gene. Using
RFLPs, they found that the SCN4A gene was closely linked to the growth
hormone gene (GH1; 139250) on 17q (maximum lod = 9.89 at theta = 0.00).
Furthermore, with very high odds, the gene was placed between NGFR
(162010) and TK1 (188300).

Using clones of the SCN4A gene, George et al. (1991) found a regional
assignment of 17q23.1-q25.3 by study of somatic cell hybrids that
retained various portions of human chromosome 17. The growth hormone
gene cluster (139250), which spans 47 kb, was assigned to 17q22-q24.
Bennani-Baiti et al. (1995) demonstrated that the GH gene cluster and
the SCN4A gene colocalized to a single 525-kb YAC. Furthermore,
restriction mapping and sequencing demonstrated that the SCN4A gene and
the entire GH gene cluster are contained within 100 kb on chromosome 17
and are separated by only 21.5 kb. Remarkably, Bennani-Baiti et al.
(1995) found that multiple elements critical to tissue-specific
transcriptional activation of the GH gene lie within the SCN4A gene.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Mutations in the SCN4A gene have been identified in a group of related
muscular disorders, including hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (HYPP;
170500), paramyotonia congenita (PMC; 168300), a group of disorders
classified as potassium-aggravated myotonia (608390), and hypokalemic
periodic paralysis type 2 (HOKPP2; 613345).

Ackerman and Clapham (1997) gave a comprehensive review of the role of
ion channel defects in disease and provided figures illustrating the
physiology and structure of ion channels and patch-clamp measurement of
ion channel activity.

- Hyperkalemic Periodic Paralysis

In 3 of 7 unrelated patients with HYPP (170500), Ptacek et al. (1991)
identified the same mutation in the SCN4A gene (T704M; 603967.0001). In
9 of 12 families with HYPP, Feero et al. (1993) identified mutations in
the SCN4A gene: 3 families had the M1592V mutation (603967.0002) and 6
had the T704M mutation. No mutation was identified in 3 families, 1 of
whom did not show linkage to the SCN4A gene, suggesting genetic
heterogeneity. Jurkat-Rott et al. (2000) stated that 5 mutations in the
SCN4A gene had been reported in HYPP patients, none of which was
directly located in the voltage sensors.

- Paramyotonia Congenita

In patients with paramyotonia congenita (163800), McClatchey et al.
(1992) identified 2 point mutations in the III-IV cytoplasmic loop
region of the SCN4A gene (603967.0007-603967.0008), and suggested that
these are the first known examples of molecular definition of
temperature-sensitive mutations. The authors postulated that the
mutations restrict the channel movement in response to transmembrane
potential, and that even a minor drop in temperature may impede movement
of the loop enough to allow an abnormal sodium flux.

Gay et al. (2008) reported a female infant with severe fatal neonatal
nondystrophic myotonia in whom they identified a heterozygous mutation
(N1297K; 603967.0027) in the SCN4A gene. The phenotype showed
overlapping features of paramyotonia congenita and hyperkalemic periodic
paralysis.

- Potassium-Aggravated Myotonia

Lerche et al. (1993) identified heterozygous mutations in the same codon
of the SCN4A gene (G1306V, 603967.0007; G1306A, 603967.0012; and G1306E,
603967.0025) in patients with exercise and potassium-aggravated
myotonia, myotonia fluctuans, and myotonia permanens, respectively (see
608390). Patch-clamp recordings on patient muscle samples showed slower
sodium fast channel inactivation and an increase in late channel
opening, resulting in a steady-state inward current, sustained muscle
depolarization, and muscle fiber hyperexcitability. The findings
indicated that SCN4A residue 1306 is important for sodium channel
inactivation.

In a family with dominantly inherited potassium-aggravated myotonia
(608390), Orrell et al. (1998) found a heterozygous mutation in the
SCN4A gene (603967.0009). The myotonic phenotype was characterized by
painful cramps, stiffness without weakness, fluctuation of symptoms, and
cold sensitivity.

- Hypokalemic Periodic Paralysis

In 4 affected individuals of family with hypokalemic periodic paralysis,
Bulman et al. (1999) identified a mutation in the SCN4A gene
(603967.0015). In several families with HOKPP in which defects of the
CACNL1A3 gene (CACNA1S; 114208) had been excluded, Jurkat-Rott et al.
(2000) identified 2 disease-causing mutations in the SCN4A gene
(603967.0016-603967.0017). This form of HOKPP did not differ clinically
from the form of the disorder due to mutations in the gene for CACNL1A3.

Sokolov et al. (2007) showed that, in contrast with the well-established
paradigm in which alterations in control of ion conductance through the
central pore of ion channels impair cell function, 3 mutations in gating
charge-carrying arginine residues in an S4 segment that cause
hypokalemic periodic paralysis (HOKPP) induce a
hyperpolarization-activated cationic leak through the voltage sensor of
the skeletal muscle Nav1.4 channel. This gating pore current is active
at the resting membrane potential and closed by depolarizations that
activate the voltage sensor. It has similar permeability to sodium,
potassium, and cesium ions, but the organic monovalent cations
tetraethylammonium and N-methyl-D-glucamine are much less permeant. The
inorganic divalent cations barium, calcium, and zinc are not detectably
permeant and block the gating pore at millimolar concentrations. Sokolov
et al. (2007) concluded that their results revealed gating pore current
in naturally occurring disease mutations of an ion channel and showed a
clear correlation between mutations that cause gating pore current and
hypokalemic periodic paralysis. This gain-of-function gating pore
current would contribute in an important way to the dominantly inherited
membrane depolarization, action potential failure, flaccid paralysis,
and cytopathology that are characteristic of hypokalemic periodic
paralysis. Sokolov et al. (2007) postulated that their observations
might be generalizable to other ion channelopathies.

Matthews et al. (2009) identified mutations in the CACNA1S (114208) or
SCN4A gene in 74 (almost 90%) of 83 patients with HOKPP. All of the
mutations, including 3 novel mutations, affected arginine residues in
the S4 voltage sensing region in 1 of the transmembrane domains of each
gene. The most common CACNA1S mutations affected residues arg528 (25
cases) and arg1239 (39 cases) (see, e.g., R1239H; 114208.0001 and R528H;
114208.0003). The most common SCN4A mutations affected residues arg672
(see, e.g., 603967.0016) and arg1132. The findings supported the
hypothesis that loss of positive charge in S4 voltage sensors is
important to the pathogenesis of this disorder. (Sokolov et al., 2007).

Francis et al. (2011) demonstrated that an R1132Q mutation (603967.0030)
in the domain III voltage sensor domain of SCN4A found in a family with
HOKPP created an anomalous gating pore current similar to that observed
by Sokolov et al. (2007). This current is sufficient to depolarize and
render the muscle fiber inexcitable particularly during low external
potassium. The findings suggested a mechanism for loss of sarcolemmal
excitability during attacks of weakness in HOKPP. In contrast, the
R1148C mutation (603967.0003) causing PMC does not result in gating pore
abnormalities.

- Congenital Myasthenic Syndrome

In a patient with a myasthenic syndrome associated with fatigable
generalized weakness and recurrent attacks of respiratory and bulbar
paralysis since birth (614198), Tsujino et al. (2003) identified a
val1442-to-glu (V1442E; 603967.0018) mutation in the SCN4A gene.

ANIMAL MODEL

Rudolph et al. (1992,1992) identified a mutation in the SCN4A gene in
Quarter horses with HYPP (see 170500).

Hayward et al. (2008) introduced a missense substitution corresponding
to the human M1592V mutation into the mouse Scn4a gene and found that
few homozygous mutant (m/m) mice survived and those that did showed
fixed limb weakness, muscle atrophy, and abnormal muscle morphology.
Heterozygous (+/m) mice showed only a mild myopathy at 4 months of age,
but myopathic changes developed with age and included electrical
myotonia, fiber type switching to a more oxidative type, size variation,
and internalized nuclei, and +/m muscle developed less tetanic force and
exhibited slower relaxation compared with muscle from wildtype controls.
Rapid and sustained weakness of isolated mutant muscle was induced when
the extracellular K+ concentration was increased to that observed in
exercising human muscle interstitium, and weakness was exacerbated by
lowering extracellular Ca(2+) and by partial inhibition of the Na+/K+
pump. Mutant muscle recovered from stimulation-induced fatigue more
slowly than did control muscle, particularly in the presence of high
extracellular K+. Hayward et al. (2008) concluded that this myotonia is
consistent with persistent Na+ influx through the noninactivating mutant
Na+ channel that mildly depolarizes the membrane and thereby increases
excitability.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HYPERKALEMIC PERIODIC PARALYSIS
PARAMYOTONIA CONGENITA/HYPERKALEMIC PERIODIC PARALYSIS, INCLUDED
SCN4A, THR704MET

In 3 of 7 unrelated patients with HYPP (170500), Ptacek et al. (1991)
identified a C-T change at a CpG dimer in the SCN4A gene, resulting in a
thr704-to-met (T704M) substitution in S5 of domain II in the
membrane-spanning segment of the sodium channel protein. All 3 patients
had prominent fixed muscle weakness, whereas the remaining 4 did not. In
2 of the families, the mutation cosegregated with HYPP; in the third it
appeared to be a de novo mutation. The authors noted that threonine-704
is absolutely conserved in sodium channel genes across highly divergent
species.

Sillen et al. (1996) found the T704M mutation in 2 Swedish families with
HYPP. The mutation was linked to different microsatellite alleles,
suggesting that the mutation may have arisen independently in the 2
families.

In a family with features of both HYPP and paramyotonia congenita
(168300), which the authors termed 'paralysis periodica paramyotonica,'
Kim et al. (2001) identified the T704M mutation. Both exercise
sensitivity and temperature sensitivity were present, and the authors
commented on the phenotypic variation resulting from this mutation.

In an Italian kindred in which 9 members were affected with a severe
form of HYPP/PMC, Brancati et al. (2003) found the T704M mutation. Onset
of the disorder was in the first months of life in all affected patients
and the episodes of paralysis increased in severity and frequency,
sometimes up to several times a day, with age.

Miller et al. (2004) identified the T704M mutation in affected members
of 10 kindreds with HYPP. All patients had onset before 1 year of age
and overall showed only a 50% chance of favorable response to
acetazolamide.

Hisama (2005) described a 7-generation family in which multiple members
were affected with a complicated neurologic phenotype including variable
features of neuropathy, myotonia, and periodic paralysis. The same
family had been described in the medical literature since 1934. The
proband had late-onset demyelinating Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT1B;
118200), muscle cramping, and myotonia. His sister had HYPP, and his
father had severe childhood-onset CMT and periodic paralysis. Multiple
other relatives had similar features of 1 or both disorders. Molecular
analysis identified a missense mutation in the MPZ gene (159440) in the
proband and the SCN4A T704M mutation in the sister; the father was
deceased. One other family member tested had the MPZ mutation, and 4
other family members had the SCN4A mutation. Hisama (2005) commented on
the unusual occurrence of 2 genetically unlinked neurologic disorders in
this family and emphasized the diagnostic difficulties.

.0002
HYPERKALEMIC PERIODIC PARALYSIS
PARAMYOTONIA CONGENITA/HYPERKALEMIC PERIODIC PARALYSIS, INCLUDED
SCN4A, MET1592VAL

In a patient with familial hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (170500),
Rojas et al. (1991) identified an A-to-G transition in the SCN4A gene,
resulting in a met-to-val substitution in a highly conserved region of
the alpha subunit, predicted to be in S6 of transmembrane domain IV. The
same change was found as a new mutation in a sporadic case. Rojas (1992)
stated that the transition occurred at nucleotide 4774 and changed met
to val at residue 1592 (M1592V). Heine et al. (1993) found the M1592V
mutation in 6 families with a myotonic, nondystrophic form of
hyperkalemic periodic paralysis.

Kelly et al. (1997) described a large kindred in which affected members
were phenotypically heterogeneous with episodic potassium-sensitive
paralysis as well as stiffness and weakness induced by exercise and
cold, suggesting a combined paramyotonia congenita (168300)/HYPP
phenotype. Affected members had the M1592V mutation, and the authors
commented on the phenotypic variation associated with this mutation.

.0003
PARAMYOTONIA CONGENITA
SCN4A, ARG1448CYS

In a family with paramyotonia congenita (168300), Ptacek et al. (1992)
identified a mutation in the SCN4A gene, resulting in an arg1448-to-cys
(R1448C) substitution. This codon is a highly conserved residue in the
S4 helix of domain IV in the adult skeletal muscle sodium channel. In 2
other families with paramyotonia congenita, Ptacek et al. (1992) found a
mutation in the same codon, resulting in an arg1448-to-his (R1448H)
substitution (see 603967.0004).

.0004
PARAMYOTONIA CONGENITA
SCN4A, ARG1448HIS

See 603967.0003 and Ptacek et al. (1992).

Meyer-Kleine et al. (1994) found that the R1448H mutation is
exceptionally frequent in the Ravensberger Land region of northwest
Germany where it exists on a specific SCN4A microsatellite haplotype,
indicating a founder effect within this subpopulation.

.0005
PARAMYOTONIA CONGENITA/HYPERKALEMIC PERIODIC PARALYSIS
SCN4A, ALA1156THR

In a family of Finnish extraction whose affected members displayed an
unusual mixture of clinical features of both PMC (168300) and HYPP
(170500), McClatchey et al. (1992) identified a 3466G-A transition in
the SCN4A gene, resulting in an ala1156-to-thr (A1156T) substitution.

.0006
PARAMYOTONIA CONGENITA/MYOTONIA CONGENITA
MYOTONIA FLUCTUANS, INCLUDED
SCN4A, SER804PHE

In affected members of an Italian family with features of both
paramyotonia congenita (168300) and myotonia congenita (see 608390),
McClatchey et al. (1992) identified a 2411C-T transition in the SCN4A
gene, resulting in a ser804-to-phe (S804F) substitution predicted to be
in the cytoplasmic face of the sixth transmembrane segment of domain II.
A serine had been present at this position in all sodium channels
sequenced to that date.

Ricker et al. (1994) found the S804F mutation in a family with the
'myotonia fluctuans' (608390) phenotype. See also 603967.0012.

.0007
PARAMYOTONIA CONGENITA
MYOTONIA, POTASSIUM-AGGRAVATED, INCLUDED
SCN4A, GLY1306VAL

In a Belgian family with paramyotonia congenita (168300), McClatchey et
al. (1992) identified a 3917G-T transversion in the SCN4A gene,
resulting in a gly1306-to-val (G1306V) substitution. The mutation
affected a highly conserved residue in the III-IV cytoplasmic loop, a
portion of the sodium channel thought to pivot in response to membrane
depolarization, thereby blocking and inactivating the channel. Muscle
weakness was not reported. The authors suggested that this is a
temperature-sensitive mutation.

Lerche et al. (1993) identified a heterozygous G1306V substitution in a
mother and son with potassium-aggravated myotonia (608390). Muscle
stiffness in these individuals was also aggravated by exercise, but not
by cold. Muscle weakness was not reported. Patch-clamp recordings on
patient muscle samples showed slower sodium fast channel inactivation
and an increase in late channel opening, resulting in a steady-state
inward current, sustained muscle depolarization, and muscle fiber
hyperexcitability. Lerche et al. (1993) identified different pathogenic
mutations in the same codon (G1306A; 603967.0012 and G1306E;
603967.0025) in other families with similar disorders, indicating that
residue 1306 is important for sodium channel inactivation.

Dupre et al. (2009) reported French Canadian patients with myotonia
associated with the G1306V mutation. They had moderate myotonia with
mild muscle hypertrophy. They noted exacerbation of symptoms with cold
temperatures but no paradoxical myotonia. Female patients showed
dramatic symptom improvement after menopause.

.0008
PARAMYOTONIA CONGENITA
SCN4A, THR1313MET

In a family with paramyotonia congenita (168300) living in North
America, McClatchey et al. (1992) identified a C-T transition in the
SCN4A gene, resulting in a thr1313-to-met (T1313M) substitution. The
mutation affected a highly conserved residue in the III-IV cytoplasmic
loop of the protein.

Tahmoush et al. (1994) identified the T1313M mutation in a 3-generation
paramyotonia congenita family with 5 affected individuals.
Single-channel recordings of normal and abnormal sodium channels in
myotubes in tissue-cultured muscles derived from the proband showed that
abnormal sodium channels at 22 degrees centigrade exhibited long
duration and late openings.

Yamada et al. (1995) found the same mutation in a Japanese woman and her
son who had paramyotonia congenita manifested by difficulty in closure
of eyelids or chewing, and stiffness and weakness in hands aggravated by
cold beginning at about 7 years of age.

Matthews et al. (2011) reported a family with PMC due to the
heterozygous T1313M mutation. Before correct diagnosis, the youngest
affected individual presented with neonatal inspiratory stridor and poor
feeding. Laryngoscopy showed findings consistent with laryngomalacia. He
continued to have stridor for the first 6 months of life, and later
motor milestones were mildly delayed. In early childhood, he was noted
to have frequent episodic muscle weakness and stiffness associated with
cold weather. At age 4 years, he continued to have episodes of
inspiratory stridor exacerbated by viral illness, cold weather, and
prolonged laughing or crying. His mother, grandfather, and great-uncle
reported similar episodes of muscle stiffness and weakness exacerbated
by cold and exercise.

.0009
MYOTONIA, POTASSIUM-AGGRAVATED
PARAMYOTONIA CONGENITA, INCLUDED
SCN4A, VAL1589MET

In a family with potassium-aggravated myotonia (608390) without muscle
weakness, Heine et al. (1993) identified a 4765G-A transition in exon 24
of the SCN4A gene, predicted to result in a val1589-to-met (V1589M)
substitution. The myotonia in this family was aggravated by both cold
and potassium loading, similar to PMC (168300). The mutation is located
within transmembrane segment S6 of channel repeat IV close to the
cytoplasmic surface, a region thought to act as acceptor of the
inactivation gate of the channel. An increase in the number of
noninactivating sodium channels had been demonstrated in earlier
electrophysiologic studies on excised muscle from the index patient. The
nearby M1592V (603967.0002) mutation causes hyperkalemic periodic
paralysis (170500) of the myotonic, nondystrophic form.

Orrell et al. (1998) identified the V1589M mutation in a family in which
9 members over 4 generations had cramps in the fingers, toes, and
eyelids, consistent with potassium-aggravated myotonia. A reduction in
amplitude of compound muscle action potential on cooling and
administration of potassium was demonstrated. The authors noted that the
phenotype in this family was milder than that in the family reported by
Heine et al. (1993).

.0010
MYOTONIA CONGENITA, ATYPICAL, ACETAZOLAMIDE-RESPONSIVE
SCN4A, ILE1160VAL

In a patient with acetazolamide-responsive myotonia congenita without
periodic paralysis (see 608390), Ptacek et al. (1994) identified a
3555A-G transition in the SCN4A gene, predicted to result in an
ile1160-to-val (I1160V) substitution. This isoleucine is a highly
conserved residue, cosegregated with the disease phenotype in one
studied kindred, and was not present in samples from 100 unrelated
unaffected individuals.

.0011
PARAMYOTONIA CONGENITA
SCN4A, LEU1433ARG

Ptacek et al. (1993) reported that a leu1433-to-arg (L1433R) change in
the SCN4A gene results in the paramyotonia congenita (168300) phenotype.

.0012
MYOTONIA FLUCTUANS
SCN4A, GLY1306ALA

In affected members of 3 families with a muscle sodium channel disorder
termed 'myotonia fluctuans' (see 608390), Ricker et al. (1994)
identified a 3917G-C transition in exon 22 of the SCN4A gene, resulting
in a gly1306-to-ala (G1306A) substitution. The mutation resides in the
region of the sodium channel protein containing the cytoplasmic loop
between domains 3 and 4. The phenotype consists of fluctuating myotonia
of varying severity, a warm-up phenomenon, worsening of myotonia after
potassium loading, increased myotonia of delayed onset following
exercise, and no significant increase of myotonia following exposure to
cold. Muscle weakness did not occur. One other family with the same
phenotype had a previously described mutation of the sodium channel
(603967.0006).

Lerche et al. (1993) identified the G1306A mutation in a patient with
myotonia fluctuans. Patch-clamp recordings on patient muscle samples
showed slower sodium fast channel inactivation and an increase in late
channel opening, resulting in a steady-state inward current, sustained
muscle depolarization, and muscle fiber hyperexcitability. Lerche et al.
(1993) identified different pathogenic mutations in the same codon
(G1306V; 603967.0007 and G1306E; 603967.0025) in other families with
similar disorders, indicating that residue 1306 is important for sodium
channel inactivation.

.0013
PARAMYOTONIA CONGENITA
SCN4A, VAL1293ILE

In 3 unrelated 3-generation families segregating paramyotonia without
cold paralysis (see 168300) as an autosomal dominant trait, Koch et al.
(1995) identified a novel 3877G-A transition in exon 21 of the SCN4A
gene, resulting in a val1293-to-ile (V1293I) substitution. The amino
acid alteration was not found to be a mild polymorphism in their survey
of 200 chromosomes from the German population. The predicted mutation
was located at the intracellular phase of segment S6 in domain III of
the channel protein. Val1293 is conserved in human, rat, and eel.

.0014
MYOTONIA CONGENITA, ATYPICAL
SCN4A, VAL445MET

Rosenfeld et al. (1997) reported the first known mutation in the first
repeat domain (D1) of the SCN4A gene. The previous conspicuous absence
of mutations in this region fueled speculation that mutations in this
domain were either inconsequential or possibly lethal. The mutation,
val445-to-met (V445M), was associated with an unusual form of painful
congenital myotonia (see 608390). The distinctive phenotype suggested
that the pattern of sodium channel dysfunction might also be unique.

Wang et al. (1999) characterized the V445M mutation using heterologous
expression of recombinant mutant and wildtype skeletal muscle sodium
channel alpha subunits. Their findings established that the mutation
causes a defect in sodium channel gating that is compatible with a
myotonia-producing lesion. The pattern of dysfunction was distinct from
other muscle sodium channel mutations, supporting the notion that D1
sodium channel mutations may be associated with unusual phenotypes. They
also demonstrated that flecainide effectively suppressed the abnormal
channel behavior, consistent with the observed clinical efficacy of the
drug in treating the unusual form of myotonia.

Dupre et al. (2009) reported French Canadian patients with the V445M
mutation. The phenotype was characterized by severe and painful
generalized myotonia and severe muscle hypertrophy. Ethanol or
mexiletine significantly alleviated myotonia in 1 patient.

.0015
HYPOKALEMIC PERIODIC PARALYSIS, TYPE 2
SCN4A, ARG669HIS

Bulman et al. (1999) found an arg669-to-his (R669H) mutation in the
SCN4A gene in a family in which 4 members had hypokalemic periodic
paralysis (613345).

By in vitro studies, Kuzmenkin et al. (2002) showed that the R669H
mutation caused enhanced fast and slow inactivation of the SCN4A sodium
channel. The inactivation defect could be alleviated by decreased pH,
which may explain why some patients have relief by some physical
exercise.

.0016
HYPOKALEMIC PERIODIC PARALYSIS, TYPE 2
SCN4A, ARG672HIS

Studying 5 families with hypokalemic periodic paralysis (613345) in
which defects in the CACNL1A3 gene (CACNA1S; 114208) had been excluded,
Jurkat-Rott et al. (2000) found 2 families with mutations in the SCN4A
gene: arg672-to-his (R672H) and arg672-to-gly (R672G; 603967.0017). The
mutations were located in the voltage sensor of domain-2. Excised
skeletal muscle fibers from a patient heterozygous for R672G displayed
depolarization and weakness in low-potassium extracellular solution.
Slowing and smaller size of action potentials were suggestive of
excitability of the wildtype channel population only. Alterations found
were decisive for the pathogenesis of episodic muscle weakness by
reducing the number of excitable sodium channels, particularly at
sustained membrane depolarization. This form of the disease was caused
by enhanced channel inactivation and current reduction, and showed no
myotonia.

By in vitro studies in HEK293 cells, Kuzmenkin et al. (2002) showed that
the R672H mutation caused enhanced fast inactivation of the SCN4A sodium
channel. The inactivation defect could be alleviated by decreased pH,
which may explain why some patients have relief by some physical
exercise.

.0017
HYPOKALEMIC PERIODIC PARALYSIS, TYPE 2
SCN4A, ARG672GLY

See 603967.0016 and Jurkat-Rott et al. (2000).

By in vitro studies in HEK293 cells, Kuzmenkin et al. (2002) showed that
the R672G mutation caused enhanced slow and fast inactivation of the
SCN4A sodium channel.

.0018
MYASTHENIC SYNDROME, CONGENITAL, ACETAZOLAMIDE-RESPONSIVE
SCN4A, VAL1442GLU

In a patient with a myasthenic syndrome associated with fatigable
generalized weakness and recurrent attacks of respiratory and bulbar
paralysis since birth (614198), Tsujino et al. (2003) detected compound
heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the SCN4A gene involving conserved
residues not present in 400 normal alleles: a ser246-to-leu (S246L)
change in the S4/S5 cytoplasmic linker in domain I, and a val1442-to-glu
(V1442E) change in the S3/S4 extracellular linker in domain IV. The
genetically engineered V1442E sodium channel expressed in cultured cells
showed marked enhancement of fast inactivation close to the resting
potential, and enhanced use-dependent inactivation on high-frequency
stimulation. The proband's asymptomatic mother and sister were
heterozygous for the S246L mutation. The authors concluded that S246L is
likely a benign polymorphism, whereas the V1442E mutation defines a
novel disease mechanism and a novel phenotype with myasthenic features.
Tsujino et al. (2003) concluded that the inheritance pattern of this
congenital myasthenic syndrome could not be unambiguously established.
They suggested that the more severe V1442E mutation may be dominant, but
it could not be proven because the mutation was observed only in
combination with S246L on the other chromosome.

PARAMYOTONIA CONGENITA
SCN4A, GLY1456GLU

In a large Japanese family with paramyotonia congenita (168300), Sasaki
et al. (1999) identified a heterozygous 4367G-A change in exon 24 of the
SCN4A gene, resulting in a gly1456-to-glu (G1456E) substitution in S4 of
domain IV of the channel. Only 3 of 9 affected members reported episodes
of severe generalized weakness, which were always after cold exposure.

In a family with PMC without periodic paralysis, which the authors
termed 'pure paramyotonia,' Davies et al. (2000) identified the G1456E
mutation. The authors predicted that the mutation would impair voltage
sensing or channel inactivation in a temperature-dependent fashion and
concluded that exon 24 is a hotspot for paramyotonia mutations.

.0020
HYPOKALEMIC PERIODIC PARALYSIS, TYPE 2
SCN4A, ARG672SER

In the proband of a family with HOKPP (613345), Davies et al. (2001)
identified a heterozygous 2014C-A change in exon 12 of the SCN4A gene,
resulting in an arg672-to-ser (R672S) substitution. The patient
responded well to acetazolamide. The authors noted that 2 other
mutations in the same codon had been reported in HOKPP (see 603967.0016
and 603967.0017).

Functional expression studies of the R672S sodium channel by Bendahhou
et al. (2001) showed a small but significant hyperpolarizing shift in
the steady-state fast inactivation, and a dramatic enhancement in
channel slow inactivation. The defects are mainly due to a slow recovery
of the mutant channels from inactivation. The authors noted that their
patient with this mutation had shown a worsening of symptoms from
acetazolamide.

Venance et al. (2004) reported a sporadic patient with HOKPP and the
R672S mutation who responded well to acetazolamide. The authors noted
the variability in response to the drug and suggested that carbonic
anhydrase inhibitors should be considered in patients with HOKPP.

.0021
HYPOKALEMIC PERIODIC PARALYSIS, TYPE 2
SCN4A, PRO1158SER

In a Japanese family with an unusual form of hypokalemic periodic
paralysis (613345), Sugiura et al. (2000) identified a 3472C-T
transition in exon 19 of the SCN4A gene, resulting in a pro1158-to-ser
(P1158S) substitution between the fourth and fifth transmembrane
segments of domain III. The phenotype in this family was unusual in that
affected members showed heat-induced myotonia and cold-induced paralysis
with hypokalemia. Myotonia lessened with exercise and was alleviated by
cold, thus distinguishing the myotonia from paramyotonia congenita
(168300). Treatment with acetazolamide alleviated the myotonia, but
slightly worsened the paralysis. Patients showed seasonal swings with
myotonia in the summer and paralysis in the winter, with hypokalemia
during the paralytic attacks.

By functional studies, Sugiura et al. (2003) showed that the P1158S
mutation exhibited temperature-dependent negative shifts in the voltage
dependence of activation and inactivation as well as a slower rate of
inactivation compared to wildtype.

.0022
NORMOKALEMIC PERIODIC PARALYSIS, POTASSIUM-SENSITIVE
SCN4A, ARG675GLY

In 5 affected members of a family with potassium-sensitive normokalemic
periodic paralysis (see 170500), Vicart et al. (2004) identified a
heterozygous C-to-G transversion in exon 13 of the SCN4A gene, resulting
in an arg675-to-gly (R675G) substitution within the membrane-spanning
segment S4 of domain II of the protein, which is known to be involved in
the voltage sensing of the channel. Affected members of 2 additional
unrelated families with a similar phenotype were found to have
heterozygous mutations in the same codon: R675Q (603967.0023) and R675W
(603967.0024). Acetazolamide therapy was effective in almost all
patients. Vicart et al. (2004) noted that mutations affecting codon
672--R672H (603967.0016), R672G (603967.0017), and R672S
(603967.0020)--and codon 669 (R669H; 603967.0015) affect 2 nearby
arginines in segment S4 of domain II and lead to hypokalemic periodic
paralysis (613345).

.0025
MYOTONIA PERMANENS
SCN4A, GLY1306GLU

In a woman with severe myotonia permanens (608390), Lerche et al. (1993)
identified a heterozygous 3917G-A transition in the SCN4A gene,
resulting in a gly1306-to-glu (G1306E) substitution in the III-IV linker
region of the protein. Patch-clamp recordings on patient muscle samples
showed slower sodium fast channel inactivation and an increase in late
channel opening, resulting in a steady-state inward current, sustained
muscle depolarization, and muscle fiber hyperexcitability. Lerche et al.
(1993) identified different pathogenic mutations in the same codon
(G1306V; 603967.0007 and G1306A; 603967.0012) in other families with
similar disorders, indicating that residue 1306 is important for sodium
channel inactivation.

Colding-Jorgensen et al. (2006) identified a heterozygous G1306E
substitution in a father and son with myotonia permanens. The authors
noted that the mutation may interfere with the channel voltage sensor.

.0026
PARAMYOTONIA CONGENITA
SCN4A, MET1476ILE

In 44 patients from 11 French Canadian families with a myotonia
phenotype most consistent with paramyotonia congenita (168300),
Rossignol et al. (2007) identified a heterozygous 4428G-A transition in
the SCN4A gene, resulting in a met1476-to-ile (M1476I) substitution in a
highly conserved residue of the domain IV cytoplasmic loop, which is
known to be involved in fast inactivation. The patients originated from
the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region with notable clustering around
Saint-Felicien. Haplotype analysis indicated a founder effect. The
phenotype was quite variable, with age at onset ranging from 5 to 67
years (mean, 21 years) and mild to severe symptoms. Eleven (25%)
patients were asymptomatic despite myotonic discharges on EMG. The most
consistent features were cold-induced myotonia (41%) and painful
myotonia (18%). Potassium challenge was not conducted.

.0027
PARAMYOTONIA CONGENITA/HYPERKALEMIC PERIODIC PARALYSIS
SCN4A, ASN1297LYS

In a female infant with severe fatal neonatal nondystrophic myotonia
with overlapping features of paramyotonia congenita (168300) and
hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (170500), Gay et al. (2008) identified a
de novo heterozygous 3891C-A transversion in exon 21 of the SCN4A gene,
resulting in an asn1297-to-lys (N1297K) substitution in the interdomain
loop III-IV. The mutation was not found in either parent or in 100
controls.

.0028
PARAMYOTONIA CONGENITA
SCN4A, ILE693THR

In 6 patients from 4 unrelated European families with paramyotonia
congenita (168300), Matthews et al. (2008) identified a heterozygous
mutation in the SCN4A gene, resulting in an ile693-to-thr (I693T)
substitution in the domain II S4-5 cytoplasmic loop. All the patients
presented with transient neonatal hypotonia, in some cases requiring
feeding or respiratory assistance, and later developed classic PMC by
age 5 years. Earlier generations of 3 of the families reported a history
of PMC without neonatal hypotonia. The findings expanded the phenotypic
spectrum of PMC to include neonatal hypotonia.

.0029
PARAMYOTONIA CONGENITA
SCN4A, ILE141VAL

In affected members of a family with a phenotype consistent with
paramyotonia congenita (168300), Petitprez et al. (2008) identified a
heterozygous A-to-G transition in exon 4 of the SCN4A gene, resulting in
an ile141-to-val (I141V) substitution in the first transmembrane segment
of domain I. The patients had myotonia without muscle weakness. The
mutation was not identified in unaffected family members and 100 control
individuals. In vitro functional expression studies showed that the
mutant protein resulted in a hyperpolarizing shift of the activation
curve, with concomitant increase in window current amplitude, suggestive
of a gain of function. The studies also showed enhanced slow
inactivation, which may have prevented weakness.

.0030
HYPOKALEMIC PERIODIC PARALYSIS, TYPE 2
SCN4A, ARG1132GLN

In affected members of a 3-generation family with HOKPP2 (613345), Carle
et al. (2006) identified a heterozygous 3395G-A transition in exon 18 of
the SCN4A gene, resulting in an arg1132-to-gln (R1132Q) substitution in
the voltage sensor S4 of domain III. The mutation segregated with the
disorder in the family and was not found in 325 control individuals. In
vitro functional expression studies in HEK cells showed that the
mutation induced a depolarizing shift in the voltage dependence, as well
as enhancement of both fast and slow inactivation. These results were
consistent with a loss-of-function effect with reduced effectiveness of
membrane excitability, resulting in muscle hypoexcitability. Sodium
channel conductance was similar to wildtype.

In Xenopus oocytes, Francis et al. (2011) demonstrated that the R1132Q
mutation caused an abnormal gating pore current with a sustained inward
sodium flow, consistent with a leaky channel. This current is sufficient
to depolarize and render the muscle fiber inexcitable particularly
during low external potassium. The findings suggested a mechanism for
loss of sarcolemmal excitability during attacks of weakness in HOKPP. In
contrast, the R1148C mutation (603967.0003) causing PMC did not result
in gating pore abnormalities.

606268	TITLE *606268 WINGLESS-TYPE MMTV INTEGRATION SITE FAMILY, MEMBER 10A; WNT10A
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The WNT gene family consists of structurally related genes encoding
secreted signaling molecules that have been implicated in oncogenesis
and in several developmental processes, including regulation of cell
fate and patterning during embryogenesis. For general information about
WNT genes, see WNT1 (164820).

CLONING

By searching for sequences homologous to the mouse Wnt10b sequence
(601906), Kirikoshi et al. (2001) identified WNT10A in human chromosome
2 draft sequence and assembled a cDNA sequence using PCR techniques.
WNT10A encodes a deduced 417-amino acid peptide containing residues
conserved among WNTs and 2 N-linked glycosylation sites. WNT10A shares
59.2% amino acid sequence identity with human WNT10B. Using Northern
blot analysis, Kirikoshi et al. (2001) detected 3.0- and 2.4-kb WNT10A
transcripts at moderate levels in fetal kidney, placenta, and adult
spleen and at low levels in fetal lung, adult kidney, prostate, and
ovary. They detected WNT10A overexpression in human cancer cell lines,
including HL-60 (promyelocytic leukemia), Raji (Burkitt lymphoma), and
SW480 (colorectal cancer), where it was coexpressed with WNT6 (604663).
Kirikoshi et al. (2001) hypothesized that, like WNT1 and WNT10B, WNT10A
and WNT6 may play key roles in human carcinogenesis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Using sequence analysis, Kirikoshi et al. (2001) determined that the
WNT10A gene contains 4 exons and is clustered with WNT6 (604663) in a
head-to-tail manner with an interval of less than 7 kb.

MAPPING

Using genomic sequence analysis, Kirikoshi et al. (2001) mapped the
WNT10A gene to chromosome 2q35 near the WNT6 gene.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Odontoonychodermal dysplasia (OODD; 257980) is a rare autosomal
recessive syndrome in which the presenting phenotype is dry hair, severe
hypodontia, smooth tongue with marked reduction of fungiform and
filiform papillae, onychodysplasia, keratoderma, and hyperhidrosis.
Adaimy et al. (2007) studied 3 consanguineous Lebanese Muslim Shiite
families that included 6 individuals affected with OODD. Screening of
genes within the candidate region on chromosome 2q35-q36.2 led to
identification of the same homozygous glu233-to-stop nonsense mutation
in exon 3 of the WNT10A gene (606268.0001) in all patients. The authors
stated that this was the first report of a human phenotype resulting
from a mutation in WNT10A, and the first demonstration of an ectodermal
dysplasia caused by an altered WNT signaling pathway.

In 12 patients from 11 unrelated families of German and Turkish origin
with ectodermal dysplasia, who were known to be negative for mutation in
the ectodysplasin-A gene (EDA; 300451), Bohring et al. (2009) identified
homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for 3 missense and 2 nonsense
mutations in the WNT10A gene (606268.0002-606268.0006, respectively). A
brother and sister from 1 family had oligodontia and sparse body hair
and eyebrows as their only manifestations, and a female proband from
another family had cysts of the eyelids in addition to hypodontia,
hypotrichosis, palmoplantar keratosis, and dystrophic nails (SSPS;
224750). Despite the high degree of variability in phenotypic
expression, Bohring et al. (2009) stated that there was no recognizable
genotype/phenotype correlation.

- Selective Tooth Agenesis 4

In an American family with variable hypodontia involving the lateral
incisors and premolar teeth (STHAG4; 150400), Kantaputra and
Sripathomsawat (2011) analyzed the candidate gene WNT10A and identified
2 different missense mutations, F228I (606268.0003) and D217N
(606268.0007), for which affected members were heterozygous or compound
heterozygous. None of the family members had other manifestations of
ectodermal dysplasia.

Van den Boogaard et al. (2012) identified WNT10A mutations in 19 (56%)
of 34 unrelated patients with nonsyndromic tooth agenesis (see, e.g.,
606268.0002-606268.0004), 8 of whom were homozygous 4 compound
heterozygous, and 7 heterozygous for the mutations. The most frequent
mutation, F228I (606268.0003), represented 62% of the WNT10A mutations
in these nonsyndromic hypodontia patients, a frequency that was
significantly higher (OR, 17.9; p less than 0.05) than the frequency of
F228I observed in unselected controls (2.3%). The authors concluded that
WNT10A is a major gene in the etiology of isolated hypodontia.

WNT10A, GLU233TER

In affected members from 3 families with odontoonychodermal dysplasia
(OODD; 257980), Adaimy et al. (2007) demonstrated homozygosity for the
same nonsense mutation in the WNT10A gene. A 697G-T transversion in exon
3 causes substitution of a stop codon for the negatively charged glu233
(E233X), resulting in a prematurely truncated protein of 232 amino acids
instead of 417 amino acids.

In affected members of 3 families with odontoonychodermal dysplasia
(OODD; 257980) and 1 proband of a family with Schopf-Schulz-Passarge
syndrome (SPSS; 224750), Bohring et al. (2009) identified homozygosity
for a 321C-A transversion in the WNT10A gene, resulting in a
cys107-to-ter (C107X) substitution that was not found in 200 control
chromosomes. In 2 additional probands with OODD, the C107X mutation was
found in compound heterozygosity with a phe228-to-ile (F228I;
606268.0003) mutation, and in a brother and sister who had oligodontia
and sparse body hair and eyebrows as their only manifestations, the
C107X mutation was found in compound heterozygosity with an
arg128-to-gln (R128Q; 606268.0004) mutation. Of 18 heterozygous carriers
of the C107X mutation, 10 exhibited some phenotypic manifestation,
including anomalies of teeth, skin, and nails.

In 2 unrelated patients with nonsyndromic tooth agenesis (STHAG4;
105400), van den Boogaard et al. (2012) identified heterozygosity for
the C107X mutation in the WNT10A gene; in 3 other patients, the mutation
was present in compound heterozygosity with the F228I mutation.

In 2 probands with odontoonychodermal dysplasia (OODD; 257980), Bohring
et al. (2009) identified homozygosity for a 682T-A transversion in the
WNT10A gene, resulting in a phe228-to-ile (F228I) substitution at an
evolutionarily conserved residue. In 2 additional probands with OODD,
the F228I mutation was found in compound heterozygosity with the C107X
mutation (606268.0002). The F228I mutation was not found in 200 control
chromosomes. Of 15 heterozygous carriers of the F228I mutation, 7
exhibited some phenotypic manifestation, including anomalies of teeth,
skin, hair, and nails.

In the affected father and eldest son from an American family with
variable hypodontia involving lateral incisors and premolar teeth
(STHAG4; 150400), Kantaputra and Sripathomsawat (2011) identified
heterozygosity for the F228I mutation in the WNT10A gene. Another
affected son, who had only microdontia of the left mandibular second
premolar, was compound heterozygous for F228I and a 649G-A transition in
exon 3 of the WNT10A gene, resulting in an asp217-to-asn (D217N;
606268.0007) substitution, which he had inherited from his unaffected
mother, who had normal dentition. The D217N mutation was also present in
heterozygosity in another affected son, who had absence of the maxillary
permanent lateral incisors, mandibular second premolars, and a
mandibular permanent lateral incisor. Examination of the family members
revealed no other manifestations of ectodermal dysplasia. Neither
mutation was found in 200 control chromosomes from individuals with
normal dentition from a Thai DNA bank registry or in 400 Swedish and 400
Pakistani control chromosomes.

In 13 patients with nonsyndromic tooth agenesis, van den Boogaard et al.
(2012) identified the F228I mutation in the WNT10A gene; the mutation
was homozygous in 7 patients, heterozygous in 2 patients, and compound
heterozygous with C107X in 3 patients and with G95K (606268.0008) in 1
patient. The authors noted that F228I was found in unselected controls
at an allele frequency of 2.3%, reflecting the high prevalence of tooth
agenesis in the general population.

only manifestations, Bohring et al. (2009) identified compound
heterozygosity for a 383G-A transition in the WNT10A gene, resulting in
an arg128-to-gln (R128Q) substitution at an evolutionarily conserved
residue, and the C107X mutation (606268.0002). Of 2 family members who
were heterozygous carriers of the R128Q mutation, 1 was noted to have
sparse eyebrows. The R128Q mutation was found in 2 of 396 control
chromosomes.

In a patient with nonsyndromic tooth agenesis (STHAG4; 105400), van den
Boogaard et al. (2012) identified heterozygosity for the R128Q mutation
in the WNT10A gene.

In a female proband with odontoonychodermal dysplasia (OODD; 257980),
born of first-cousin parents, Bohring et al. (2009) identified
homozygosity for a 27G-A transition in the WNT10A gene, resulting in a

615090	TITLE *615090 INTERFERON, LAMBDA-4; IFNL4
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Interferon-lambda (IFNL) genes, such as INFL4, encode type III
interferons (IFNs) that induce antiviral activity, including suppression
of hepatitis C virus (HCV; see 609532) replication, through activation
of the JAK (see 147795)-STAT (see 600555) pathway and upregulation of
IFN-stimulated genes (e.g., ISG15; 147571). IFNL4 is only expressed in
individuals who have a frameshift variant (dbSNP ss469415590) that
'creates' the gene. In individuals without the variant, IFNL4 is a
pseudogene (Prokunina-Olsson et al., 2013).

CLONING

By stimulating primary hepatocytes with poly(I:C), a synthetic mimic of
double-stranded HCV RNA and an inducer of IFNL genes, followed by mRNA
sequence analysis, Prokunina-Olsson et al. (2013) observed a novel
transcribed region upstream of the IFNL3 gene (607402). Using 5-prime
RACE, they identified a transcription start site and a protein
translation start site. Exon 1 contains, at codon 22, a compound
dinucleotide variant (dbSNP ss469415590; TT to delT/G) comprised of a
1-nucleotide insertion/deletion polymorphism (delT; dbSNP rs67272382)
and a 1-nucleotide substitution (T-G; dbSNP rs74597329). PCR analysis of
primary hepatocyte cDNA showed that individuals homozygous for the
delT/G allele produced multiple protein-coding transcripts, whereas
individuals homozygous for the TT allele did not. Only a predicted
179-amino acid protein, designated IFNL4, showed homology to other
proteins, sharing 29% amino acid identity with IFNL3. The IFNL4 and
IFNL3 proteins are most related within sequences corresponding to the A
and F helices of IFNL3, which bind the primary IFNL receptor, IFNLR1
(607404). However, IFNL4 differs in the sequence corresponding to the D
helix of IFNL3, which binds the second chain of the IFNL receptor
complex, IL10RB (123889).

GENE STRUCTURE

Prokunina-Olsson et al. (2013) determined that the IFNL4 gene contains
at least 5 exons.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Prokunina-Olsson et al. (2013) mapped the IFNL4
gene to chromosome 19q13.13.

GENE FUNCTION

Prokunina-Olsson et al. (2013) showed that transient transfection of a
hepatoma cell line with IFNL4, INFL3, or IFNA (147660), induced
activation of STAT1 and STAT2 (600556). Confocal microscopy demonstrated
expression of IFNL4 in transfected hepatoma cells and in
poly(I:C)-stimulated primary hepatocytes of HCV-uninfected carriers of
the delT/G allele of dbSNP ss469415590, but not in an individual
homozygous for the TT allele.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Association with Hepatitis C Virus Clearance

Prokunina-Olsson et al. (2013) found that dbSNP ss469415590, which
'creates' the IFNL4 gene, was in high linkage disequilibrium with dbSNP
rs12979860, a genetic marker strongly associated with HCV clearance.
They showed that the delT/G allele of dbSNP ss469415590 was even more
strongly correlated with poor response to pegylated IFNA/ribavirin
treatment of chronic HCV than the T allele of dbSNP rs12979860 in
individuals of African ancestry. Prokunina-Olsson et al. (2013) proposed
that IFNL4 induces weak expression of ISGs, providing an antiviral
response that lowers the HCV load, but that it also reduces responses to
type I and type III IFNs that are necessary for efficient HCV clearance.

EVOLUTION

By genomic sequence analysis in 45 species, Prokunina-Olsson et al.
(2013) found that the delT/G allele of dbSNP ss469415590 is an ancestral
variant present in all species. The existence of IFNL4 protein could be
predicted only in macaques, apes, and humans. The TT allele of dbSNP
ss469415590, which is favorable for HCV clearance and treatment
response, appeared to be recently derived and was found in 93%, 68%, and
23% of Asian, European, and African populations, respectively, according
to HapMap samples.

608337	TITLE *608337 OTU DOMAIN-CONTAINING UBIQUITIN ALDEHYDE-BINDING PROTEIN 1; OTUB1
;;OTU DOMAIN-CONTAINING UBAL-BINDING PROTEIN 1;;
OTUBAIN 1; OTU1; OTB1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Otubains, such as OTB1, are deubiquitylating cysteine proteases (DUBs;
see 602519) that belong to the ovarian tumor (OTU) protein superfamily.
Like other DUBs, otubains cleave proteins precisely at the ubiquitin
(UB; see 191339)-protein bond (Balakirev et al., 2003).

CLONING

By affinity purification of DUBs from HeLa cells using UB aldehyde
(UBAL), followed by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrophotometric analysis,
Balakirev et al. (2003) obtained cDNAs encoding OTB1 and OTB2 (608338).
The 271-amino acid, 31-kD OTB1 protein contains UB-interaction motifs
(UIMs) and UB-associated (UBA) domains, as well as putative nuclear
localization signals and a consensus LxxLL motif. RT-PCR and Western
blot analyses revealed wide expression of OTB1, with 2 isoforms in
leukocytes.

By PCR and immunoblot analysis, Soares et al. (2004) identified an
815-bp OTB1 isoform, which was expressed ubiquitously, and a 950-bp
isoform, which was expressed only in lymphoid tissue. The 815-bp isoform
encodes the 31-kD protein reported by Balakirev et al. (2003), whereas
the 950-bp isoform encodes a 35-kD, 315-amino acid protein, OTB1ARF1
(OTB1 alternative reading frame-1), that lacks the asp and cys residues
in the OTU cysteine proteinase catalytic core and retains only the
C-terminal flanking region of the OTU domain. The OTB1ARF1 transcript is
produced from the same transcription start site as OTB1 but uses an AUG
codon located in exon 2 and in a different reading frame from that of
OTB1. In addition, there is no splicing between exons 4 and 5 in
OTB1ARF1, which causes a frameshift back to the same reading frame as
OTB1.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Soares et al. (2004) showed that GRAIL
(RNF128; 300439) binds to OTB1. Although OTB1 was found to have DUB
activity, it failed to deubiquitinate polyubiquitinated GRAIL.
Immunoprecipitation and coexpression analysis indicated that OTB1, but
not OTB1ARF1, binds to the C-terminal UCH catalytic domain of USP8
(603158) in a trimolecular complex with GRAIL. Soares et al. (2004)
studied cells from T-cell receptor-transgenic mice expressing the
alternative forms of OTB1. OTB1-expressing cells contained negligible
amounts of Grail, proliferated well, and produced large amounts of
interleukin-2 (IL2; 147680) after antigenic stimulation. In contrast,
cells expressing OTB1ARF1 contained large amounts of Grail and were
functionally anergic, proliferating poorly and not producing Il2. Soares
et al. (2004) concluded that the balance of OTB1 and OTB1ARF1 in T cells
is an important factor that regulates GRAIL stability and the outcome of
immune responses in secondary lymphoid organs.

Nakada et al. (2010) reported that OTUB1, a deubiquitinating enzyme, is
an inhibitor of double stranded break induced chromatin ubiquitination.
Surprisingly, they found that OTUB1 suppresses RNF168 (612688)-dependent
polyubiquitination independently of its catalytic activity. OTUB1 does
so by binding to and inhibiting UBC13 (UBE2N; 603679), the cognate E2
enzyme for RNF168. Nakada et al. (2010) suggested that this unusual mode
of regulation is unlikely to be limited to UBC13 because analysis of
OTUB1-associated proteins revealed that OTUB1 binds to E2s of the UBE2D
and UBE2E subfamilies. Finally, OTUB1 depletion mitigates the
double-stranded break repair defect associated with defective ATM
(607585) signaling, indicating that pharmacologic targeting of the
OTUB1-UBC13 interaction might enhance the DNA damage response.

Using immunoblot analysis, Lin et al. (2009) demonstrated expression of
GRAIL in naive mouse and human CD4 (186940) T lymphocytes. They found
that, upon CD4 T-cell activation, OTUB1 was expressed and GRAIL was
degraded, allowing proliferation to proceed. Preventing OTUB1 expression
with CTLA4 (123890)-Ig, anti-IL2, or rapamycin, all of which target MTOR
(FRAP1; 601231), resulted in maintenance of GRAIL and inhibition of CD4
T-cell proliferation. Lin et al. (2009) concluded that a pathway
sequentially links CD28 (186760) costimulation, IL2 expression, IL2R
(IL2RA; 147730) signaling, and MTOR activation as important requirements
for naive CD4 T-cell proliferation through the regulation of OTUB1 and
GRAIL expression.

GENE STRUCTURE

Soares et al. (2004) determined that the OTB1 gene contains 7 exons.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Wiener et al. (2012) described structural and biochemical studies
elucidating how OTUB1 inhibits UBC13 and other E2 enzymes. They
unexpectedly found that OTUB1 binding to UBC13-Ub (the ubiquitin
thiolester) is allosterically regulated by free ubiquitin, which binds
to a second site in OTUB1 and increases its affinity for UBC13-Ub, while
at the same time disrupting interactions with UEV1A (602995) in a manner
that depends on the OTUB1 N terminus. Crystal structures of an
OTUB1-UBC13 complex and of OTUB1 bound to ubiquitin aldehyde and a
chemical UBC13-Ub conjugate showed that binding of free ubiquitin to
OTUB1 triggers conformational changes in the OTU domain and formation of
a ubiquitin-binding helix in the N terminus, thus promoting binding of
the conjugated donor ubiquitin in UBC13-Ub to OTUB1. The donor ubiquitin
thus cannot interact with the E2 enzyme, which has been shown to be
important for ubiquitin transfer. The N-terminal helix of OTUB1 is
positioned to interfere with UEV1A binding to UBC13, as well as with
attack on the thiolester by an acceptor ubiquitin, thereby inhibiting
K63Ub synthesis. OTUB1 binding also occludes the RING E3 binding site on
UBC13, thus providing a further component of inhibition. Wiener et al.
(2012) concluded that the general features of the inhibition mechanism
explained how OTUB1 inhibits other E2 enzymes in a noncatalytic manner.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Balakirev et al. (2003) mapped the OTUB1
gene to chromosome 11q13.1.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CDH15, or M-cadherin, belongs to the cadherin family of Ca(2+)-dependent
cell adhesion molecules. Cadherins are transmembrane glycoproteins
consisting of an extracellular domain, a transmembrane region, and a
cytoplasmic domain. The extracellular domains mediate Ca(2+)-dependent
intercellular adhesion by homophilic interactions. The binding
properties and specificities of the adhesive function are located in the
N-terminal part of the molecules. In addition to M-cadherin, neural
(114020), placental (114021), and epithelial (also called uvomorulin;
192090) forms of cadherin have been characterized (Donalies et al.,
1991).

CLONING

Donalies et al. (1991) identified M-cadherin in myogenic mouse cells.
M-cadherin was not found in fibroblasts and was expressed at low levels
in myoblasts.

In whole human brain and cerebellum, Bhalla et al. (2008) detected
predominant expression of a 2.9-kb CDH15 transcript and faint expression
of 3 larger transcripts of 3.8-, 6.9-, and 8.0-kb. Other brain sections
including occipital lobe, thalamus, and hippocampus showed very faint or
no detectable expression.

GENE FUNCTION

Donalies et al. (1991) found that M-cadherin was upregulated after
induction of myotube formation, indicating a specific function in
skeletal muscle cell differentiation.

MAPPING

Kaupmann et al. (1992) used a mouse myotube-derived cDNA encoding
M-cadherin to demonstrate linkage of the gene (symbolized Cdh3 by them)
to the gene for E-cadherin (uvomorulin; Um) in a mouse interspecific
backcross. The linkage group is located on chromosome 8 in a region of
conserved synteny with human chromosome 16q. The gene order was
cen--Junb--Um--Tat--(Cdh3/Aprt). The human homolog, symbolized CDH3 by
them, was mapped to 16q24.1-qter by analyzing human/mouse somatic cell
hybrids. Kremmidiotis et al. (1998) mapped the human CDH15 gene to
16q24.3 using somatic cell hybrid panels.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 4 of 647 unrelated patients with autosomal dominant mental
retardation-3 (MRD3; 612580), Bhalla et al. (2008) identified 4
different heterozygous mutations in the CDH15 gene (see, e.g.,
114019.0001-114019.0003). In vitro functional expression studies in
mouse cells showed that 3 of the mutant proteins resulted in decreased
cell adhesion. Bhalla et al. (2008) concluded that alterations in the
CDH15 gene, either alone or in combination with other factors, likely
play a role in mental retardation.

ANIMAL MODEL

Hollnagel et al. (2002) developed M-cadherin-null mice. Homozygous
mutant mice were viable and fertile and showed no gross developmental
defects. Skeletal musculature appeared normal, and satellite cells were
able to form new myofibers following muscle damage. In the cerebellum of
M-cadherin-null mice, typical adherens junctions were present and
appeared normal; however, expression of N-cadherin was increased
compared with wildtype animals. Hollnagel et al. (2002) concluded that
M-cadherin is not absolutely required for muscle and cerebellar
development, and that N-cadherin or other cadherins largely compensate
for lack of M-cadherin.

NOMENCLATURE

The human cadherin gene represented by this entry, CDH15, is symbolized
Cdh14 in mouse. CDH15 has also been referred to as CDH3; however, CDH3
is the official gene symbol for P-cadherin (114021).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MENTAL RETARDATION, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT 3
CDH15, ARG60CYS

In a woman with mental retardation (MRD3; 612580), Bhalla et al. (2008)
identified a heterozygous 178C-T transition in the CDH15 gene, resulting
in an arg60-to-cys (R60C) substitution in a highly conserved residue
within the first extracellular cadherin ectodomain repeat. In vitro
functional expression studies in mouse cells that lack cadherins showed
that the R60C-mutant protein decreased cell-to-cell adhesion by greater
than 80% compared to normal.

.0002
MENTAL RETARDATION, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT 3
CDH15, ARG92TRP

In a woman with mild mental retardation (MRD3; 612580), Bhalla et al.
(2008) identified a heterozygous 274C-T transition in the CDH15 gene,
resulting in an arg92-to-trp (R92W) substitution in a highly conserved
residue within the first extracellular cadherin ectodomain repeat. The
mutant allele was transmitted to her son, who had learning and memory
difficulties. In vitro functional expression studies in mouse cells that
lack cadherins showed that the R92W-mutant protein decreased
cell-to-cell adhesion by greater than 80% compared to normal.

.0003
MENTAL RETARDATION, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT 3
CDH15, ALA122VAL

In a woman with mild mental retardation (MRD3; 612580), Bhalla et al.
(2008) identified a heterozygous 365C-T transition in the CDH15 gene,
resulting in an ala122-to-val (A122V) substitution in a highly conserved
residue within the first extracellular cadherin ectodomain repeat. She
inherited the mutant allele from her father, who was reported as having
normal cognitive function, but had no formal clinical evaluation. The
authors postulated either incomplete penetrance or that this variant may
only produce symptoms upon interaction with other factors. In vitro
functional expression studies in mouse cells that lack cadherins showed
that the A122V-mutant protein decreased cell-to-cell adhesion by greater
than 80% compared to normal.

613213	TITLE *613213 CYTOCHROME b5 REDUCTASE 3; CYB5R3
;;B5R;;
NADH-DIAPHORASE 1; DIA1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The CYB5R3 gene encodes cytochrome b5 reductase-3 (EC 1.6.2.2.), an
enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of reducing equivalents from NADH to
cytochrome b5 (CYB5A; 613218), which then acts as an electron donor. The
membrane-bound isoform of CYB5R3 plays a role in physiologic processes,
including cholesterol biosynthesis and fatty acid elongation and
desaturation, whereas the soluble isoform of CYB5R3 is present in
erythrocytes and functions to reduce methemoglobin to hemoglobin (review
by Percy and Lappin, 2008).

CLONING

Yubisui et al. (1987) reported molecular cloning of cDNAs for the gene
mutant in autosomal recessive methemoglobinemia (250800). There are 2
forms of NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase: a membrane-bound form in somatic
cells and a soluble form in erythrocytes. The former exists mainly on
the cytoplasmic side of the endoplasmic reticulum and functions in
desaturation and elongation of fatty acids, in cholesterol biosynthesis,
and in drug metabolism. The erythrocyte form is located in a soluble
fraction of circulating erythrocytes and is involved in methemoglobin
reduction. Membrane-bound enzyme consists of 300 amino acid residues
having both membrane-binding and catalytic domains. The soluble type
consists of 275 amino acids having only the catalytic domain. The 2
forms of the enzyme are coded by the same gene, CYB5R3 (Katsube et al.,
1991).

Pietrini et al. (1992) showed that the 2 forms of NADH-cytochrome b5
reductase are produced from a single gene: a myristylated membrane-bound
enzyme expressed in all tissues, and a soluble, erythrocyte-specific
isoform. The 2 forms are identical except for the N terminus, which
mediates binding to the lipid bilayer in the membrane and contains the
myristylation consensus sequence. They are produced by the use of
alternative promoter/alternate exons: the ubiquitous transcript is
generated from an upstream housekeeping promoter, while the reticulocyte
transcript originates from a downstream, erythroid-specific promoter.

Several workers suggested that the human soluble form is generated
through posttranslational processing of the membrane-bound form. Du et
al. (1997) used 5-prime-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) for
human reticulocyte, liver, brain, and HL-60 cell mRNAs to demonstrate
the ubiquitous presence of an alternative type of human b5R mRNA that
can probably be translated into the soluble form directly; however, the
erythroid-specific transcript of the b5R gene was not found. They showed
that this type of b5R mRNA, initiating from at least 2 sites, contains a
noncoding new first exon located between the first 2 exons of the human
b5R gene previously identified. In addition, this new first exon shares
62% homology with the rat erythroid-specific exon, whereas the 5-prime
flanking region of the new first exon possesses features of a
housekeeping gene.

GENE STRUCTURE

Tomatsu et al. (1989) demonstrated that the CYB5R3 gene is about 31 kb
long and contains 9 exons.

GENE FUNCTION

Straub et al. (2012) reported a new model for the regulation of nitric
oxide (NO) signaling by demonstrating that hemoglobin alpha, encoded by
the HBA1 (141800) and HBA2 (141850) genes, is expressed in human and
mouse arterial endothelial cells and enriched at the myoendothelial
junction, where it regulates the effects of NO on vascular reactivity.
Notably, this function is unique to hemoglobin alpha and is abrogated by
its genetic depletion. Mechanistically, endothelial hemoglobin alpha
heme iron in the Fe(3+) state permits NO signaling, and this signaling
is shut off when hemoglobin alpha is reduced to the Fe(2+) state by
endothelial CYB5R3. Genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of CYB5R3
increased NO bioactivity in small arteries. Straub et al. (2012)
concluded that their data revealed a mechanism by which the regulation
of the intracellular hemoglobin alpha oxidation state controls nitric
oxide synthase (NOS; see 163729) signaling in nonerythroid cells. The
authors suggested that this model may be relevant to heme-containing
globins in a broad range of NOS-containing somatic cells.

MAPPING

By study of rodent-human hybrids, Fisher et al. (1977) demonstrated that
the locus for NADH-diaphorase-1 (methemoglobin reductase; cytochrome b5
reductase) is on chromosome 22.

Bull et al. (1988) mapped the CYB5R3 gene to chromosome 22 by somatic
cell hybridization.

Narahara et al. (1992) described a 7-month-old girl with a terminal
deletion of chromosome 22: del(22)(q13.31). They demonstrated partial
deficiency of arylsulfatase A (ARSA; 607574) and normal levels of
CYB5R3, suggesting that the ARSA locus can be regionally assigned to
22q13.31-qter and the CYB5R3 locus excluded from the same segment.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Electrophoretic variants of red cell NADH-diaphorase were described by
Hopkinson et al. (1970). Data on gene frequencies of allelic variants
were tabulated by Roychoudhury and Nei (1988).

In sibs with type II methemoglobinemia (250800), characterized by
neurologic involvement, Kobayashi et al. (1990) identified a homozygous
mutation in the CYB5R3 gene (S128P; 613213.0001). Enzyme activity in
patient lymphoblastoid cells was reduced to 10% of normal.

In a patient with type I hereditary methemoglobinemia (250800),
characterized only by cyanosis and no neurologic involvement, Katsube et
al. (1991) found a homozygous mutation in the CYB5R3 gene (R58Q;
613213.0002). In an Italian patient with type I methemoglobinemia,
Shirabe et al. (1992) identified a homozygous mutation in the CYB5R3
gene (V106M; 613213.0004). The mutant enzyme was less heat stable than
the wildtype enzyme.

In 3 unrelated patients with severe recessive congenital
methemoglobinemia type II manifested by cyanosis in association with
severe mental retardation and neurologic impairment, Vieira et al.
(1995) identified homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the
CYB5R3 gene (613213.0006-613213.0009).

Percy et al. (2002) stated that 33 different mutations in the CYB5R3
gene causing autosomal recessive congenital methemoglobinemia had been
reported.

Maran et al. (2005) reported 4 unrelated patients with recessive
methemoglobinemia: 2 with type I and 2 with type II. Four different
mutations in the CYB5R3 gene were identified (see, e.g., 613213.0008 and
613218.0012). Methemoglobin levels ranged from 12 to 30%.

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

Shirabe (1997) pointed out that missense mutations found in patients
with type II methemoglobinemia are located close to the catalytic center
of the enzyme and the recombinant mutant enzymes have low catalytic
efficiency, whereas mutations in patients with type I are in the
marginal portion of the enzyme, which may only be detrimental to the
stability of the enzyme.

Aalfs et al. (2000) presented a diagram of the CYB5R3 gene showing the
location of 6 mutations that cause methemoglobinemia type I and 13
mutations that cause type II. It appeared that type II was more often
associated with full stops or deletions, whereas type I was more likely
to be associated with amino acid substitutions.

Dekker et al. (2001) investigated 7 families with methemoglobinemia type
I and found 7 novel mutations in the b5R gene. Six of these mutations
predicted amino acid substitutions at sites not involved in reduced NADH
or FAD binding. The seventh mutation, a splice site mutation leading to
skipping of exon 5 in mRNA, was present in heterozygous form together
with a missense mutation on the other allele. Two other substitutions
known to cause the type II form of the disease were found to affect the
consensus FAD-binding site directly or influence NADH binding
indirectly. These data supported the idea that enzyme inactivation is a
cause of type II disease, whereas enzyme instability may lead to the
type I form.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
METHEMOGLOBINEMIA, TYPE II
CYB5R3, SER128PRO

This variant, originally reported as SER127PRO, has been designated
SER128PRO based on revised numbering (Percy and Lappin, 2008).

In sibs with type II methemoglobinemia (250800), Kobayashi et al. (1990)
identified a homozygous 382T-C transition in exon 5 of the CYB5R3 gene,
resulting in a ser128-to-pro (S128P) substitution. Enzyme activity in
patient lymphoblastoid cells was reduced to 10% of normal controls, but
mRNA and protein were detectable. The mutation was predicted to be in an
alpha-helix structure that is part of a nucleotide-binding domain,
suggesting that it caused a significant conformation change and
functional enzyme deficiency.

Yubisui et al. (1991) prepared and characterized mutant enzymes in which
ser128 was replaced by pro (S128P) or by ala (S128A) by utilizing the
expression system of the soluble form of the enzyme in Escherichia coli
and by site-directed mutagenesis. The purified mutant enzymes showed
indistinguishable spectral properties, which differed from those of the
wildtype enzyme, and were less thermostable than the wildtype enzymes.
The results indicated that ser128 plays an important role in maintaining
the structure of the NADH-binding site in the enzyme. The numbering of
ser128 is for the membrane-bound form of b5R, which has 300 residues.
This variant was referred to as 'b5R Hiroshima.'

.0002
METHEMOGLOBINEMIA, TYPE I
CYB5R3, ARG58GLN

This variant, originally reported as ARG57GLN, has been designated
ARG58GLN based on revised numbering (Percy and Lappin, 2008).

In a patient with type I hereditary methemoglobinemia (250800), Katsube
et al. (1991) found a 173G-A transition in exon 3 of the CYB5R3 gene,
resulting in an arg58-to-gln (R58Q) substitution. The mutation abolished
the MspI recognition site. Homozygosity for the mutation was confirmed
by restriction analysis of PCR-amplified fragments and by dot-blot
hybridization of amplified products with allele-specific oligonucleotide
probes. This variant was referred to as 'b5R Toyoake.'

.0003
METHEMOGLOBINEMIA, TYPE I
CYB5R3, LEU149PRO

This variant, originally reported as LEU148PRO, has been designated
LEU149PRO based on revised numbering (Percy and Lappin, 2008).

In 2 Japanese brothers, born of consanguineous parents, with hereditary
methemoglobinemia (250800) without neurologic impairment (Tanishima et
al., 1985), Katsube et al. (1991) found a homozygous 446T-C transition
in exon 5 of the CYB5R3 gene, resulting in a leu148-to-pro (L148P)
substitution. The mutation generated a recognition site for MspI. This
variant was referred to as 'b5R Kurobe.' Deficiency of NADH cytochrome
b5 reductase was observed in lymphocytes and platelets as well as in
erythrocytes, but there was no associated mental retardation. Katsube et
al. (1991) referred to this as 'type III.'

By in vitro functional studies, Nagai et al. (1993) found that the
mutant L159P enzyme retained about 60% of the catalytic activity of
wildtype, but was remarkably heat unstable. Incubation of the mutant
enzyme at 42 degrees C for 10 minutes resulted in 80% loss of enzyme
activity, whereas the wildtype enzyme lost less than 20% activity after
incubation at 50 degrees C for 30 minutes. Another mutant in which
leu149 was replaced by ala also showed decreased heat stability compared
to wildtype, implying a structural role for leu149. Reinvestigation of
the enzyme activity in the blood cells and fibroblasts of the type III
Kurobe patient (Katsube et al., 1991) revealed that about 40% of the
normal activity was detectable in these cells, in contrast to the
previous report. Thus, these patients, previously reported as having
hereditary methemoglobinemia type III, were shown to have type I. This
indicated that the designation of a type III methemoglobinemia is not
necessary because the sole family with this type actually had type I
disease.

.0004
METHEMOGLOBINEMIA, TYPE I
CYB5R3, VAL106MET

This variant, originally reported as VAL105MET, has been designated
VAL106MET based on revised numbering (Percy and Lappin, 2008).

In an Italian patient with type I methemoglobinemia (250800), Shirabe et
al. (1992) identified a 316G-A transition in exon 4 of the CYB5R3 gene,
resulting in a val106-to-met (V106M) substitution. The mutant enzyme was
less heat stable than the wildtype enzyme.

.0005
METHEMOGLOBINEMIA, TYPE II
CYB5R3, IVS8AS, G-T, -1

In the cultured fibroblasts of a patient with generalized deficiency of
NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase (type II methemoglobinemia; 250800),
Shirabe et al. (1995) identified a homozygous G-to-T transversion in
intron 8 of the CYB5R3 gene, resulting in a splice site mutation and
complete absence of immunologically detectable enzyme in blood cells and
skin fibroblasts. The patient was the daughter of Italian second-cousin
parents. She had appeared cyanotic from the first days of life, and
showed failure to thrive and psychomotor developmental delay. At 1 year
of age, she had severe spastic and dystonic quadriparesis with
hyperkinetic involuntary movements, severe microcephaly, and very simple
and primitive reactions to environmental changes. She also developed
refractory seizures. At the age of 9 years, the patient was in a
vegetative status. Cultured fibroblasts of the patient showed severely
reduced NADH-dependent cytochrome c reductase, ferricyanide reductase,
and semidehydroascorbate reductase activities. The last activity is
known to be due to enzyme located on outer mitochondrial membranes;
thus, their results demonstrated that the reductase in the endoplasmic
reticulum and in the outer mitochondrial membranes are the product of
the same gene and suggested that a defect in ascorbate regeneration may
contribute to the phenotype of hereditary methemoglobinemia of the
generalized type.

METHEMOGLOBINEMIA, TYPE II
CYB5R3, IVS5DS, G-C, +8

In an Algerian patient born of consanguineous parents with type II
methemoglobinemia, Vieira et al. (1995) identified a deletion of exon 5
of the CYB5R3 gene resulting from a G-to-C transversion in intron 5 at
position +8, downstream from the 5-prime splice site of exon 5. Abnormal
splicing of the primary transcripts apparently resulted in a frameshift
with a premature stop codon. The patient was homozygous for the
mutation.

.0007
METHEMOGLOBINEMIA, TYPE II
CYB5R3, ARG219TER

This variant, originally reported as ARG218TER, has been designated
ARG219TER based on revised numbering (Percy and Lappin, 2008).

In an Algerian patient with clinical manifestations of congenital
methemoglobinemia type II (250800), Vieira et al. (1995) identified
homozygosity for an arg219-to-ter (R219X) substitution in exon 8 of the
CYB5R3 gene. The patient had profound mental retardation, microcephaly,
and bilateral athetosis associated with cyanosis and absent enzyme
activities in erythrocytes, lymphocytes, and lymphoblastoid cell lines,

.0008
METHEMOGLOBINEMIA, TYPE II
CYB5R3, CYS204ARG

This variant, originally reported as CYS203ARG, has been designated
CYS204ARG based on revised numbering (Percy and Lappin, 2008).

In a child with methemoglobinemia type II (250800), Vieira et al. (1995)
identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the CYB5R3 gene: a
T-to-C transition in exon 7 resulting in a cys204-to-arg (C204R)
substitution, and 3-bp deletion (met273del; 613213.0009). The diagnosis
was established at the age of 15 days on the basis of persistent
cyanosis and neurologic manifestations associated with complete enzyme
deficiency in erythrocytes and lymphocytes. Heterozygous levels of
enzyme were detected in both parents who were not related; the mother
was of Spanish ancestry and the father French. One allele carried a
missense mutation with replacement of cys203

Maran et al. (2005) reported a patient with type II methemoglobinemia
resulting from the C204R mutation. There was 30% methemoglobin; CYB5R3
activity was 50% in red blood cells and 25% in cultured lymphocytes.

.0009
METHEMOGLOBINEMIA, TYPE II
CYB5R3, 3-BP DEL, MET273DEL

This variant, originally reported as MET272DEL, has been designated
MET273DEL based on revised numbering (Percy and Lappin, 2008).

See 613213.0008 and Vieira et al. (1995).

.0010
METHEMOGLOBINEMIA, TYPE II
CYB5R3, 3-BP DEL, 895TTC

This variant, originally reported as PHE298DEL, has been designated
PHE299DEL based on revised numbering (Percy and Lappin, 2008).

In a Japanese patient from Yokohoma with type II methemoglobinemia
(250800), Shirabe et al. (1994) identified a homozygous 3-bp in-frame
deletion (895delTTC) in exon 9 of the CYB5R3 gene, resulting in a
deletion of phenylalanine at position 299. Although the mechanism
leading to the deletion was still controversial, the slipped mispairing
model was proposed as the most plausible one. The patient, of Japanese
origin from Yokohama, had retarded growth, mental retardation, and
cyanosis. The mutant enzyme activity was 0.4% that of wildtype and much
less thermostable.

.0011
NADH-CYTOCHROME b5 REDUCTASE POLYMORPHISM
CYB5R3, THR117SER

This variant, originally reported as THR116SER, has been designated
THR117SER based on revised numbering (Percy and Lappin, 2008).

Jenkins and Prchal (1997) claimed to have demonstrated the first
polymorphism in the CYB5R3 gene: a C-to-G transversion in exon 5,
resulting in a thr117-to-ser (T117S) substitution. The polymorphism was
found only in African Americans among whom 26 of 112 chromosomes showed
the G form, giving an allele frequency of 0.23. It was not found in 108
Caucasian, 46 Asian, 44 Indo-Aryan, or 14 Arabic chromosomes.
Preliminary studies indicated that the polymorphism did not correlate
with enzyme activity or produce any disease phenotype. It remained to be
determined whether this African-specific polymorphism that apparently
originated recently in human evolution provides any special survival
advantage.

.0012
METHEMOGLOBINEMIA, TYPE II
CYB5R3, IVS5AS, A-C, -2

In a 4-year-old boy with type II methemoglobinemia (250800), Owen et al.
(1997) identified a homozygous in-frame deletion of exon 6 that resulted
in the deletion of 28 amino acids (codons 155 to 182). A homozygous
A-to-C transversion of the invariant AG dinucleotide of the intron 5
splice acceptor site was discovered and considered to be consistent with
skipping of exon 6. The patient had dystonic athetoid cerebral palsy
with mental retardation and microcephaly. He was found to have 60%
methemoglobin that was persistent but responded to ascorbic acid
treatment.

Maran et al. (2005) reported a patient with type II methemoglobinemia
resulting from the IVS5AS splice site mutation. The patient had 20%
methemoglobin. Four different mRNA transcripts were identified: a normal
transcript, an in-frame skipping of exon 6, and 2 transcripts with
partial inclusion of intron 6. Overall, mRNA levels were 7% of normal
controls. CYB5R3 activity was 2% of controls in red blood cells and 25%
in cultured lymphocytes.

.0013
METHEMOGLOBINEMIA, TYPE I
CYB5R3, LEU73PRO

This variant, originally reported as LEU72PRO, has been designated
LEU73PRO based on revised numbering (Percy and Lappin, 2008).

In a 3-year-old Chinese girl with type I methemoglobinemia (230800), Wu
et al. (1998) identified a homozygous T-to-C transition in the CYB5R3
gene, resulting in a leu73-to-pro (L73P) substitution. The patient was
born after normal pregnancy and delivery. From the age of 1 month she
appeared persistently cyanosed, but without mental or neurologic
abnormalities, and her respiratory and cardiac functions were normal.
The concentration of methemoglobin was 15%, and NADH-cytochrome b5R
activity in erythrocytes was decreased. Her 5-year-old brother had the
same symptoms with 14.5% methemoglobin and decreased b5R activity. The
unaffected parents had heterozygous levels of enzyme activity in red
cells (about 65% of normal controls).

.0014
METHEMOGLOBINEMIA, TYPE II
CYB5R3, GLN77TER

In a patient with methemoglobinemia type II (250800), Aalfs et al.
(2000) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 nonsense mutations in
the CYB5R3 gene: a gln77-to-ter (Q77X) mutation in exon 4 and an
arg160-to-ter mutation (R160X; 613213.0015) in exon 6. The affected
child, born of healthy, unrelated Hindustani Suriname parents, was small
for gestational age. Central cyanosis was noted shortly after birth. She
showed severe psychomotor retardation and microcephaly. There were
athetoid movements, generalized hypertonia, epilepsy, and a complete
head lag. At 6 years of age, MRI of the brain demonstrated frontal and
bitemporal cortical atrophy, cerebellar atrophy, retarded myelin
development, and hypoplasia of the basal ganglia. There was almost no
psychomotor development and spastic tetraplegia with scoliosis was
becoming evident. The patient died at the age of 8 years.

.0015
METHEMOGLOBINEMIA, TYPE II
CYB5R3, ARG160TER

See (613213.0014) and Aalfs et al. (2000).

.0016
METHEMOGLOBINEMIA, TYPE I
CYB5R3, CYS204TYR

This variant, originally reported as CYS203TYR, has been designated
CYS204TYR based on revised numbering (Percy and Lappin, 2008).

In a Chinese family, Wang et al. (2000) found that type I recessive
congenital methemoglobinemia (250800) was caused by homozygosity for a
G-to-A transition in exon 7 of the CYB5R3 gene, resulting in a
cys204-to-tyr (C204Y) substitution. A previously identified mutation in
the same codon, C204R (613213.0008), led to type II methemoglobinemia.
The milder manifestations in the patients studied by Wang et al. (2000)
was thought to be due to the fact that the catalytic activity of the
enzyme was not much affected, although the mutant enzyme exhibited
decreased heat stability and increased susceptibility to trypsin.

.0017
METHEMOGLOBINEMIA, TYPE I
CYB5R3, GLY292ASP

This variant, originally reported as GLY291ASP, has been designated
GLY292ASP based on revised numbering (Percy and Lappin, 2008).

In 1 of the original patients with type I recessive congenital
methemoglobulinemia (250800) from the studies of Deeny et al. (1943) and
Gibson (1948), Percy et al. (2002) identified heterozygosity for 2 novel
mutations in exon 9 of the CYB5R3 gene: a G-to-A transition predicting a
gly292-to-asp (G292D) substitution, and a 3-bp in-frame deletion of
codon 255 (GAG) (613213.0018), predicting loss of glutamic acid. Both
mutations occurred in the carboxyl-terminal NADH-binding lobe of the
protein. Using functional expression studies, Percy et al. (2005) showed
that the mutant G292D enzyme retained approximately 58% of residual
enzyme activity.

.0018
METHEMOGLOBINEMIA, TYPE I
CYB5R3, GLU256DEL

This variant, originally reported as GLU255DEL, has been designated
GLU256DEL based on revised numbering (Percy and Lappin, 2008).

See Percy et al. (2002) and 613213.0017. Using functional expression
studies, Percy et al. (2005) showed that the E256 deletion enzyme
retained approximately 38% of residual enzyme activity.

.0019
METHEMOGLOBINEMIA, TYPE I
CYB5R3, ASP240GLY

This variant, originally reported as ASP239GLY, has been designated
ASP240GLY based on revised numbering (Percy and Lappin, 2008).

In an Irish patient with type I methemoglobulinemia (250800), Percy et
al. (2005) identified a homozygous A-to-G transition in exon 8 of the
CYB5R3 gene, resulting in an asp240-to-gly (D240G) substitution within
the carboxyl-terminal NADH-binding lobe of the protein. In an unrelated
Irish family, 2 sibs with type I methemoglobulinemia were compound
heterozygous for the D240G mutation and another CYB5R3 mutation.
Functional expression studies showed that the D240G mutation retained
substantial enzyme activity, but had perturbed substrate binding,
causing both decreased specificity for NADH and increased specificity
for NADPH.

607353	TITLE *607353 RHO-RELATED BTB DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 3; RHOBTB3
;;KIAA0878
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

RHOBTB3 is a member of the evolutionarily conserved RHOBTB subfamily of
Rho GTPases. For background information on RHOBTBs, see RHOBTB1
(607351).

CLONING

By randomly sequencing clones from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) obtained a cDNA encoding RHOBTB3, which
they called KIAA0878. The deduced protein contains 611 amino acids.
RT-PCR followed by ELISA revealed high expression in ovary, moderate
expression in heart, brain, liver, pancreas, and testis, and weak
expression in all other tissues tested.

By searching an EST database, Ramos et al. (2002) obtained full-length
cDNAs encoding RHOBTB1, RHOBTB2 (607352), and RHOBTB3. RHOBTB3 contains
all of the domains characteristic of RHOBTB proteins. The C-terminal
domain consists of about 80 amino acids in 4 consecutive alpha helices,
with the last third having a high content of charged residues. RHOBTB3
ends in a prenylation motif not found in RHOBTB1 and RHOBTB2. RHOBTB3
shares 88% nucleotide identity with mouse Rhobtb3. Northern dot blot
analysis revealed ubiquitous expression of RHOBTB3, with highest levels
in placenta, testis, pancreas, adrenal and salivary gland, and neural
and cardiac tissue. RHOBTB3 was also expressed in fetal tissues,
particularly brain, heart, and lung. Northern blot analysis of mouse
tissues revealed ubiquitous expression, with highest levels in brain,
heart, and uterus.

GENE FUNCTION

Espinosa et al. (2009) found that RHOBTB3 bound directly to the small
GTPase RAB9 (300284) and functioned with RAB9 in recycling M6PR proteins
(154540) from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network. RHOBTB3 bound and
hydrolyzed ATP rather than GTP, and binding to RAB9 opened the
autoinhibited RHOBTB3 protein to permit maximal ATP hydrolysis. Because
RHOBTB3 interacted with the cargo selection protein TIP47 (M6PRBP1;
602702) on membranes, Espinosa et al. (2009) proposed that RHOBTB3 may
remove TIP47 from vesicles to permit their efficient docking and fusion
at the Golgi.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ramos et al. (2002) determined that the RHOBTB3 gene contains 12 exons
and spans about 66 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Ramos et al. (2002) mapped the RHOBTB3
gene to chromosome 5q14.3, upstream of the PCSK1 gene (162150).

606838	TITLE *606838 PYD AND CARD DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN; PYCARD
;;APOPTOSIS-ASSOCIATED SPECK-LIKE PROTEIN CONTAINING A CARD; ASC;;
TARGET OF METHYLATION-INDUCED SILENCING 1; TMS
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Caspase-associated recruitment domains (CARDs) mediate the interaction
between adaptor proteins such as APAF1 (602233) and the proform of
caspases (e.g., CASP9; 602234) participating in apoptosis. ASC is a
member of the CARD-containing adaptor protein family.

CLONING

By immunoscreening a promyelocytic cell line, Masumoto et al. (1999)
isolated a cDNA encoding ASC. The deduced 195-amino acid protein
contains an N-terminal pyrin (608107)-like domain (PYD) and an
87-residue C-terminal CARD. Western blot analysis showed expression of a
22-kD protein. Fluorescence microscopy demonstrated a ring-like
expression in some transfected cells. Northern and Western blot analyses
showed expression of a 0.8-kb transcript in some leukemia cell lines and
in a melanoma cell line.

Using representational difference analysis to isolate genes
downregulated in cells overexpressing DNMT1 (126375) relative to their
original fibroblast source, Conway et al. (2000) cloned and
characterized ASC, which they termed TMS1.

Martinon et al. (2001) determined that ASC, which they termed PYCARD,
shares the N-terminal PYD with NALP1 (606636) and NALP2 (609364).

GENE FUNCTION

Western blot analysis by Masumoto et al. (1999) indicated that ASC may
have proapoptotic activity by increasing the susceptibility of leukemia
cell lines to apoptotic stimuli by anticancer drugs.

Methylation-sensitive restriction PCR and methylation-specific PCR (MSP)
analyses by Conway et al. (2000) indicated that silencing of TMS1
correlates with hypermethylation of the CpG island surrounding exon 1
and that overexpression of DNMT1 promotes hypermethylation and silencing
of TMS1. Breast cancer cell lines, but not normal breast tissue,
exhibited complete methylation of TMS1 and expressed no TMS1 message.
Expression of TMS1 in breast cancer cell lines inhibited growth and
reduced the number of surviving colonies. Conway et al. (2000) concluded
that TMS1 functions in the promotion of caspase-dependent apoptosis and
that overexpression of TMS1 inhibits the growth of breast cancer cells.

Using bisulfite genomic sequencing, DNase I-hypersensitive site mapping,
and chromatin immunoprecipitation, Stimson and Vertino (2002) showed
that in normal fibroblasts, the TMS1 CpG island is composed of an
unmethylated domain with distinct 5-prime and 3-prime boundaries. De
novo methylation of the CpG island in cells overexpressing DNMT1 was
accompanied by a loss of CpG island-specific hypersensitive site
formation, localized hypoacetylation of histone H3 (see 602810) and H4
(see 602822), and gene silencing. Stimson and Vertino (2002) proposed
the existence of protein-binding sites that demarcate the boundaries of
TMS1 CpG islands in normal cells and that the boundaries are overcome by
aberrant methylation, resulting in gene silencing.

McConnell and Vertino (2000) showed that inducible expression of TMS1
inhibits cellular proliferation and induces DNA fragmentation that can
be blocked by a caspase inhibitor or by dominant-negative CASP9, but not
by CASP8 (601763). TMS1, unlike many CARD-containing proteins, does not
activate nuclear factor kappa-B (NFKB; 164011). Immunofluorescence
microscopy demonstrated that induction of apoptosis causes a
CARD-dependent shift from diffuse cytoplasmic expression to punctate or
spherical perinuclear aggregates.

Ohtsuka et al. (2004) found that, when ectopically expressed, ASC
interacted directly with BAX (600040), colocalized with BAX to the
mitochondria, induced cytochrome c release with a significant reduction
of mitochondrial membrane potential, and resulted in the activation of
CASP9, CASP2 (600639), and CASP3 (600636). The rapid induction of
apoptosis by ASC was not observed in BAX-deficient cells. Induction of
ASC after exposure to genotoxic stress was also dependent on p53
(191170). Blocking of endogenous ASC expression by small interfering RNA
reduced the apoptotic response to p53 or genotoxic insult and inhibited
translocation of BAX to mitochondria, suggesting that ASC is required to
translocate BAX to the mitochondria.

Using gene targeting to generate mice deficient in Asc or Ipaf (CARD12;
606831), Mariathasan et al. (2004) found an absence of the p20 and p10
of Casp1 (147678) in homozygous mutant but not wildtype or heterozygote
macrophages after stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). After
priming by LPS and stimulation with Salmonella typhimurium, secretion of
Il1b (147720) was significantly reduced in Asc -/- and Ipaf -/-, but not
Ripk2 (603455)-deficient, macrophages. Immunoprecipitation analysis
showed that Asc associates with Casp1, indicating that components of the
inflammasome, a multiple adaptor complex in activated monocytes and
macrophages, are released from cells secreting mature Il1b. Asc -/- and
Ipaf -/- macrophages also failed to process Casp1 after priming with Tlr
(e.g., TLR4, 603030) agonists in response to ATP, leading to impaired
release of Il1b, Il1a (147760), and Il18 (600953). Challenge of
Asc-deficient mice with a normally lethal dose of LPS resulted in only
30% mortality in 48 hours and full recovery in the remainder by day 7.
There were also some survivors among the heterozygotes. Analysis of
responses to LPS and Tnf (191160) showed no role for Asc in Erk (e.g.,
MAPK3, 601795) or Nfkb signaling. Infection of Asc- or Ipaf-deficient
macrophages with wildtype but not SipB-toxin-deficient S. typhimurium
does not result in cell death as is seen in wildtype macrophages.
Mariathasan et al. (2004) concluded that ASC is essential for CASP1
activation within the inflammasome and that CARD12 is required for CASP1
activation in response to at least 1 intracellular pathogen.

Agostini et al. (2004) noted that NALP1, unlike other short NALP
proteins, contains a C-terminal CARD domain that interacts with and
activates CASP5 (602665). CASP1 and CASP5 are activated when they
assemble with NALP1 and ASC to form the inflammasome, which is
responsible for processing the inactive IL1B precursor (proIL1B) to
release active IL1B cytokine. Using immunoprecipitation analysis,
Agostini et al. (2004) found that CARD8 (609051), which contains
C-terminal FIIND (function to find) and CARD domains, associated with
constructs of NALP2 and NALP3 (CIAS1; 606416) lacking the N-terminal
pyrin domain and/or the C-terminal leucine-rich repeat domain. They
determined that the interaction was mediated by the FIIND domain of
CARD8 and the centrally located NACHT domain of NALP2 and NALP3. The
pyrin domain of NALP2 and NALP3, like that of NALP1, interacted with the
pyrin domain of ASC, which recruits CASP1. Transfection experiments
showed that an inflammasome could be assembled containing ASC, CARD8,
CASP1, and a short NALP, resulting in activation of CASP1, but not
CASP5, and strong processing of proIL1B.

Muruve et al. (2008) demonstrated that internalized adenoviral DNA
induces maturation of pro-IL1B in macrophages, which is dependent on
NALP3 (606416) and ASC, components of the innate cytosolic molecular
complex termed the inflammasome. Correspondingly, Nalp3- and
Asc-deficient mice displayed reduced innate inflammatory responses to
adenovirus particles. Inflammasome activation also occurred as a result
of transfected cytosolic bacterial, viral, and mammalian (host) DNA, but
sensing was dependent on Asc and not Nalp3. The DNA-sensing
proinflammatory pathway functions independently of TLRs and interferon
regulatory factors. Thus, Muruve et al. (2008) concluded that, in
addition to viral and bacterial components or danger signals in general,
inflammasomes sense potentially dangerous cytoplasmic DNA, strengthening
their central role in innate immunity.

Fernandes-Alnemri et al. (2009) demonstrated that AIM2 (604578), an
interferon-inducible HIN200 family member, senses cytoplasmic DNA by
means of its C-terminal oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding domain
and interacts with ASC through its N-terminal pyrin domain to activate
caspase-1 (147678). The interaction of AIM2 with ASC also leads to the
formation of ASC pyroptosome, which induces pyroptotic cell death in
cells containing caspase-1. Knockdown of AIM2 by short interfering RNA
reduced inflammasome/pyroptosome activation by cytoplasmic DNA in human
and mouse macrophages, whereas stable expression of AIM2 in the
nonresponsive human embryonic kidney 293T cell line conferred
responsiveness to cytoplasmic DNA. Fernandes-Alnemri et al. (2009)
concluded that their results showed that cytoplasmic DNA triggers
formation of the AIM2 inflammasome by inducing AIM2 oligermization.

Using mouse and human cells, Hornung et al. (2009) identified the PYHIN
(pyrin and HIN domain-containing protein) family member AIM2 as a
receptor for cytosolic DNA, which regulates caspase-1. The HIN200 domain
of AIM2 binds to DNA, whereas the pyrin domain (but not that of the
other PYHIN family members) associates with the adaptor molecule ASC to
activate both NF-kappa-B (see 164011) and caspase-1. Knockdown of Aim2
abrogates caspase-1 activation in response to cytoplasmic
double-stranded DNA and the double-stranded DNA vaccinia virus. Hornung
et al. (2009) concluded that collectively, their observations identify
AIM2 as a new receptor for cytoplasmic DNA, which forms an inflammasome
with the ligand and ASC to activate caspase-1.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Conway et al. (2000) determined that the
TMS1 gene contains 3 exons spanning 1.4 kb, with a CpG island
surrounding exon 1.

MAPPING

Using FISH and radiation hybrid analysis, Masumoto et al. (1999) and
Conway et al. (2000) mapped the ASC gene to chromosome 16p12-p11.2.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using mice lacking Asc or mice with a deficiency of Nlrp6 (609650) in
colonic epithelial cells, Elinav et al. (2011) observed a decline in
Il18 levels and altered fetal microbiota with expansion of the
Bacterioidetes phyla. The mutant mice were characterized by spontaneous
intestinal hyperplasia, inflammatory cell recruitment, and exacerbation
of chemical colitis induced by dextran sodium sulfate (DSS). The
colitogenic activity of the altered microbiota was transferable to adult
or neonatal wildtype mice when cohoused with the mutant mice. The
exacerbation of DSS colitis was induced by Ccl5 (187011). Antibacterial,
but not antiviral, antifungal, or antihelminthic, treatment reduced the
severity of DSS colitis in Asc -/- and Nlrp6 -/- mice to wildtype levels
and lowered the transferability and severity of colitis to wildtype
mice. Elinav et al. (2011) proposed that perturbations in this
inflammasome pathway may constitute a predisposing or initiating event
in some forms of inflammatory bowel disease (see 266600).

The propensity of helminths, such as schistosomes (see 181460), to
immunomodulate the host's immune system is an essential aspect of their
survival. Ritter et al. (2010) stimulated mouse bone marrow-derived
dendritic cells (BMDCs) with soluble schistosomal egg antigens (SEAs)
after prestimulation with different TLR ligands and observed suppressed
secretion of Tnf and Il6 (147620) and increased Nlrp3-dependent Il1b
production. Induction of Il1b was phagocytosis-independent, but it
required production of reactive oxygen species, potassium efflux, and
functional Syk (600085) signaling, suggesting inflammasome activation.
SEA stimulation of BMDCs lacking Fcrg (see 146740) or dectin-2 (CLEC6A;
613579) resulted in significantly reduced Il1b production compared with
wildtype BMDCs, suggesting that SEA triggers dectin-2, which couples
with Fcrg to activate the Syk kinase signaling pathway that controls
Nlrp3 inflammasome activation and Il1b release. Infection of mice
lacking Nlrp3 or Asc with S. mansoni resulted in no difference in
parasite burden, but decreased liver pathology and downregulated Th1,
Th2, and Th17 adaptive immune responses. Ritter et al. (2010) concluded
that SEA components induce IL1B production and that NLRP3 plays a
crucial role during S. mansoni infection.

123310	TITLE *123310 CREATINE KINASE, MUSCLE TYPE; CKM
;;CKMM
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Creatine kinase (CK; EC 2.7.3.2) catalyzes the reversible transfer of a
phosphate from phosphocreatine to adenosine diphosphate, generating
adenosine triphosphate in tissues such as brain and muscle that require
large amounts of an energy source. The active form of the cytosolic
enzyme is a dimer of 2 subunit types, CKM and CKB (123280), which can
combine to form 3 electrophoretically separable isozymes, CKMM, CKBB,
and CKMB (summary by Nigro et al., 1987). The dimeric creatine kinase
isozymes are involved in maintaining intracellular ATP levels,
particularly in tissues that have high energy demands. The creatine
kinase MM isozyme is found exclusively in striated muscle; the BB
isozyme is found in smooth muscle, brain, and nerve; CKMB is found in
human heart (summary by Perryman et al., 1986).

CLONING

Dawson et al. (1968) determined that creatine kinase exists as a dimer:
the muscle enzyme (MM) consists of 2 identical M subunits, and the brain
enzyme (BB) consists of 2 identical B subunits. Other tissues showed a
third, hybrid MB enzyme. Schweinfest et al. (1985) used a chicken CK-M
cDNA clone to isolate a human clone from a cDNA library constructed from
human heart mRNA. One clone showed greater than 90% homology to rabbit
CK-M and less than 50% homology to rabbit CK-B, indicating that it
represented the human CK-M gene.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid analysis, Schweinfest et al. (1985) mapped the
human CKM gene to chromosome 19.

By in situ hybridization, Nigro et al. (1987) regionalized the
assignment of CKM to 19q13. On the basis of high-resolution g-banding,
the predominant labeling site was 19q13.2-q13.3.

By Southern analysis of hybrid cell DNA, Stallings et al. (1988)
confirmed the assignment of CKM to chromosome 19. Study of independent
hybrids that had portions of 19q missing indicated that APOC2 (608083)
is distal to CKM.

Studying DNAs from somatic cell hybrids with a rearranged 19q that
carries a breakpoint across the CKM gene, Smeets et al. (1990) localized
the CKM gene and the 2 DNA repair genes, ERCC1 (126380) and ERCC2
(126340), within the same 250 kb of DNA. The order appeared to be
cen--CKM--ERCC2--ERCC1--ter, with APOC2 (608083) being at a distance
more than 260 kb proximal to CKM. The transcriptional start sites of the
CKM and DNA-repair genes are all on the telomeric side of the genes.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 59 families with myotonic dystrophy (DM; 160900) from Italy and
Spain, Gennarelli et al. (1991) found very close linkage of the disease
to a polymorphism at the CKMM locus; maximum lod score = 21.26 at theta
= 0.00. Bailly et al. (1991) sequenced CKMM cDNA from a DM chromosome 19
and found 2 novel polymorphisms but no translationally significant
mutations. They concluded that this finding excludes the CKMM gene as
the site of mutation in DM.

ANIMAL MODEL

Steeghs et al. (1997) generated mice who had combined deficiency of
cytosolic CK (CKM) and mitochondrial CK (CKMT; 123290). This mutation
blocked creatine kinase-mediated phosphocreatine (PCr)-to-ATP
transphosphorylation in skeletal muscle. Contrary to expectation, the
PCr level was only marginally affected, but the compound was rendered
metabolically inert. Mutant muscles in vivo showed significantly
impaired tetanic force output, increased relaxation times, altered
mitochondrial volume and location, and conspicuous tubular aggregates of
sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes, as seen in myopathies with electrolyte
disturbances. In depolarized myotubes cultured in vitro, CK absence
influenced both the release and sequestration of calcium ion. The data
pointed to a direct link between the CK-PCr system and the regulation of
calcium ion flux during the excitation and relaxation phases of muscle
contraction.

611714	TITLE *611714 GTPase-ACTIVATING PROTEIN AND VPS9 DOMAINS 1; GAPVD1
;;RAB5-ACTIVATING PROTEIN 6; RAP6;;
RAB5 EXCHANGE FACTOR; GAPEX5;;
KIAA1521
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Hunker et al. (2006) identified a Rab GTPase guanine nucleotide exchange
factor (GEF), which they named RAP6 (Rab5-activating protein-6), as a
protein of approximately 150 kD that interacted with Rab5a (179512) in
HeLa cells. After isolating and characterizing the protein by mass
spectrometry, they identified it by database analysis as GAPVD1. The
deduced 1,439-amino acid protein has a predicted molecular mass of 158
kD. It contains a C-terminal Vps9-like motif, which is found in other
Rab5 GEFs, and an N-terminal RasGAP-like domain (RGD) similar to those
found in GAP proteins that specifically interact with Ras proteins. An
antibody raised to RAP6 localized the protein to the plasma membrane and
intracellular vesicles.

GENE FUNCTION

Hunker et al. (2006) confirmed that RAP6 binds to Rab5 and Ras through
the Vps9 and RGD domains, respectively. Overexpression of RAP6 affected
both fluid phase and receptor-mediated endocytosis. Hunker et al. (2006)
suggested that RAP6 may play a role in endocytosis by regulating
endosome morphology.

Su et al. (2007) studied the same protein, which they called Rab5
exchange factor (GAPEX5), in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR;
131550) trafficking and degradation. Depletion of the protein delayed
EGFR degradation, whereas overexpression had the reverse effect. Su et
al. (2007) proposed that GAPEX5 affects EGFR degradation by mediating
receptor ubiquitination through its RGD domain and may be an important
mediator of carcinogenesis resulting from mutations in the Ras proteins.

Kitano et al. (2008) found that GAPEX5 is the guanine nucleotide
exchange factor essential for activation of RAB5 (179512) during
engulfment of apoptotic cells. GAPEX5 was bound to a microtubule
tip-associating protein, EB1 (603108), whose depletion inhibited Rab5
activation during phagocytosis. Kitano et al. (2008) therefore proposed
a mechanistic model in which the recruitment of GAPEX5 to phagosomes
through the microtubule network induces transient RAB5 activation.

MAPPING

By database analysis, Hunker et al. (2006) identified the GAPVD1 gene on
chromosome 9q33.3.

608539	TITLE *608539 GLIS FAMILY ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 2; GLIS2
;;GLI-SIMILAR PROTEIN 2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the Kruppel-like zinc finger protein family, such as GLIS2,
function as activators and/or repressors of gene transcription.

CLONING

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to mouse Glis2,
followed by RT-PCR of human kidney RNA, Zhang and Jetten (2001) cloned
full-length GLIS2. The deduced 525-amino acid protein contains 5 tandem
C2H2 zinc finger motifs and has a calculated molecular mass of 55.7 kD.
Human and mouse GLIS2 share 93% amino acid identity. GLIS2 is most
closely related to members of the GLI (see 165220) and ZIC (see 600470)
subfamilies of Kruppel-like finger proteins. Northern blot analysis
detected a 3.7-kb transcript expressed most abundantly in kidney and
weakly in heart, lung, and placenta.

Zhang et al. (2002) cloned Glis2 from mouse kidney RNA. The deduced
521-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 55.8 kD.
Northern blot analysis detected highest expression in kidney. RT-PCR
detected highest expression in kidney, moderate expression in heart and
lung, and low expression in prostate, colon, and brain.
Fluorescence-tagged Glis2 transfected into simian kidney cells showed a
speckled nuclear localization, with exclusion from nucleoli. In situ
hybridization showed rodent Glis2 expressed in developing somites and
neural tube. During metanephric development, Glis2 predominantly
localized to the ureteric bud, precursor of the collecting duct, and
inductor of nephronic tubule formation.

GENE FUNCTION

By 1-hybrid analysis using deletion mutants, Zhang et al. (2002)
identified a novel activation domain at the N terminus of mouse Glis2.
Activation of transcription through this domain was completely
suppressed by 2 repressor functions just downstream from the activator
domain. The authors localized one of the repressor functions within the
first zinc finger motif. The level of transcriptional activation and
repression varied with the cell line tested, likely due to differences
in cell type-specific expression of coactivators and corepressors. Zhang
et al. (2002) concluded that Glis2 behaves as a bifunctional
transcriptional regulator.

Attanasio et al. (2007) found that Glis2 localized to both nuclei and
primary cilia in canine renal epithelial cells with expression along the
ciliary axoneme in a punctate pattern. In 8-week-old mouse kidney,
Attanasio et al. (2007) detected Glis2 expression in the inner stripe of
the outer medulla, in all renal tubule segments and epithelial cells of
Bowman capsule, but not in glomerular, mesenchymal, or endothelial
cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Zhang and Jetten (2001) determined that the GLIS2 gene contains 6 exons
and spans more than 7.5 kb. Zhang et al. (2002) determined that the
mouse Glis2 gene also contains 6 exons and spans more than 7.5 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Zhang and Jetten (2001) mapped the GLIS2
gene to chromosome 16p13.3. Zhang et al. (2002) mapped the mouse Glis2
gene to chromosome 16A3-B1.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

By positional cloning, Attanasio et al. (2007) identified the GLIS2 gene
as a cause of nephronophthisis (NPHP7; 611498). Three affected members
of a consanguineous Canadian Oji-Cree kindred with autosomal recessive
nephronophthisis had a homozygous mutation in the GLIS2 gene
(608539.0001).

ANIMAL MODEL

Attanasio et al. (2007) found that mice with targeted disruption of the
Glis2 gene had no kidney developmental abnormalities at birth. However,
from 4 weeks to 6 months, the mutant mice exhibited decreased size and
weight compared to wildtype mice. Mutant mouse kidneys showed
progressive atrophy and loss of corticomedullary junction
differentiation beginning at age 4 weeks. By 8 weeks, the hallmarks of
NPHP were present, including diffuse tubulointerstitial cell
infiltration, interstitial fibrosis, and diffuse collagen deposition.
There was also tubular basement membrane disintegration with tubular
atrophy and cysts, similar to that observed in humans. Glomerular cysts
were present, and there was apoptosis of renal tubular cells.
Differential gene expression analysis showed that genes promoting the
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition of renal tubular cells and fibrosis
were upregulated in the absence of Glis2. Attanasio et al. (2007)
concluded that Glis2 plays an essential role in the maintenance of renal
tissue architecture through prevention of apoptosis and fibrosis.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
NEPHRONOPHTHISIS 7
GLIS2, IVS5DS, G-T, +1

In 3 affected members of a consanguineous Canadian Oji-Cree kindred with
autosomal recessive nephronophthisis-7 (NPHP7; 611498), Attanasio et al.
(2007) identified a homozygous G-to-T transversion in intron 5 of the
GLIS2 gene. A minigene assay indicated that the mutation interfered with
normal splicing and resulted in a nonfunctional protein.

;;ALPHA-2,8-SIALYLTRANSFERASE IV;;
ST8SIA IV;;
POLYSIALYLTRANSFERASE; PST;;
PST1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The adhesive properties of neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM1; 116930)
are modulated by its linkage to polysialic acid (PSA). This linkage is
regulated by sialyltransferases, such as polysialyltransferase (PST) and
sialyltransferase X (STX, or ST8SIA2; 602546).

CLONING

Eckhardt et al. (1995) cloned a mammalian PST gene from Chinese hamster
ovary (CHO) cells. They reported that expression of this enzyme induces
PSA synthesis in NCAM1-expressing cell lines. Nakayama et al. (1995)
cloned a corresponding human PST cDNA which encodes a 359-amino acid
polypeptide with a single transmembrane domain structure typical of
glycosyltransferases. Its amino acid sequence is 58% identical to human
STX and 27% identical to human sialyltransferase-8 (601123). Northern
blotting revealed that PST is expressed as a 6.5-kb transcript in many
fetal tissues and in adult heart, spleen, and thymus and at lower levels
in other organs and tissues.

Angata et al. (1997) examined the expression patterns of STX and PST.
STX is primarily expressed in embryonic tissues but only modestly in
adult heart, brain, and thymus. Relative amounts of STX and PST differ
in various brain regions, but both may be active in some locations.

GENE FUNCTION

Nakayama et al. (1995) found that human HeLa cells coexpressing NCAM1
and PST promoted neurite outgrowth and sprouting. Angata et al. (1997)
found that cells cotransfected with NCAM1 and STX can support neurite
outgrowth better than cells transfected with NCAM1 alone but not as well
as cells cotransfected with NCAM1 and PST.

Polysialic acid has been implicated in numerous normal and pathologic
processes, including development, neuronal plasticity, and tumor
metastasis. Mahal et al. (2001) reported that cell surface PSA
expression can be reversibly inhibited by a small molecule,
N-butanoylmannosamine. Inhibition occurs through a metabolic mechanism
in which N-butanoylmannosamine is converted to unnatural sialic acid
derivatives that effectively act as chain terminators during cellular
PSA biosynthesis. N-propanoylmannosamine, which differs from
N-butanoylmannosamine by a single methylene group, did not inhibit PSA
biosynthesis. Modulation of PSA expression by chemical means has a role
complementary to genetic and biochemical approaches in the study of
complex PSA-mediated events.

Angata et al. (2000) compared the sialyltransferase activities of
ST8SIA2, ST8SIA3 (609478), and ST8SIA4. All 3 enzymes could add
oligosialic and polysialic acid on various sialylated
N-acetyllactosaminyl oligosaccharides, including NCAM N-glycans, fetuin
N-glycans, synthetic sialylated N-acetyllactosamines, and
alpha-2-Heremans Schmid glycoprotein. The 3 enzymes could also use
themselves as substrates in autopolysialylation reactions. The enzymes
differed in the efficiency of adding polysialic acid on NCAM, and
ST8SIA3 did not use NCAM as substrate. Upon transfection and
overexpression in HeLa cells, ST8SIA2 and ST8SIA4 formed polysialic acid
on glycoproteins in the perinuclear Golgi compartment and on
glycoproteins on the cell surface. ST8SIA3 only formed polysialic acid
on Golgi glycoproteins, confirming that it does not use cell-surface
NCAM as substrate.

MAPPING

By FISH, Angata et al. (1997) mapped the PST gene to chromosome 5q21.

613213	TITLE *613213 CYTOCHROME b5 REDUCTASE 3; CYB5R3
;;B5R;;
NADH-DIAPHORASE 1; DIA1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The CYB5R3 gene encodes cytochrome b5 reductase-3 (EC 1.6.2.2.), an
enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of reducing equivalents from NADH to
cytochrome b5 (CYB5A; 613218), which then acts as an electron donor. The
membrane-bound isoform of CYB5R3 plays a role in physiologic processes,
including cholesterol biosynthesis and fatty acid elongation and
desaturation, whereas the soluble isoform of CYB5R3 is present in
erythrocytes and functions to reduce methemoglobin to hemoglobin (review
by Percy and Lappin, 2008).

CLONING

Yubisui et al. (1987) reported molecular cloning of cDNAs for the gene
mutant in autosomal recessive methemoglobinemia (250800). There are 2
forms of NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase: a membrane-bound form in somatic
cells and a soluble form in erythrocytes. The former exists mainly on
the cytoplasmic side of the endoplasmic reticulum and functions in
desaturation and elongation of fatty acids, in cholesterol biosynthesis,
and in drug metabolism. The erythrocyte form is located in a soluble
fraction of circulating erythrocytes and is involved in methemoglobin
reduction. Membrane-bound enzyme consists of 300 amino acid residues
having both membrane-binding and catalytic domains. The soluble type
consists of 275 amino acids having only the catalytic domain. The 2
forms of the enzyme are coded by the same gene, CYB5R3 (Katsube et al.,
1991).

Pietrini et al. (1992) showed that the 2 forms of NADH-cytochrome b5
reductase are produced from a single gene: a myristylated membrane-bound
enzyme expressed in all tissues, and a soluble, erythrocyte-specific
isoform. The 2 forms are identical except for the N terminus, which
mediates binding to the lipid bilayer in the membrane and contains the
myristylation consensus sequence. They are produced by the use of
alternative promoter/alternate exons: the ubiquitous transcript is
generated from an upstream housekeeping promoter, while the reticulocyte
transcript originates from a downstream, erythroid-specific promoter.

Several workers suggested that the human soluble form is generated
through posttranslational processing of the membrane-bound form. Du et
al. (1997) used 5-prime-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) for
human reticulocyte, liver, brain, and HL-60 cell mRNAs to demonstrate
the ubiquitous presence of an alternative type of human b5R mRNA that
can probably be translated into the soluble form directly; however, the
erythroid-specific transcript of the b5R gene was not found. They showed
that this type of b5R mRNA, initiating from at least 2 sites, contains a
noncoding new first exon located between the first 2 exons of the human
b5R gene previously identified. In addition, this new first exon shares
62% homology with the rat erythroid-specific exon, whereas the 5-prime
flanking region of the new first exon possesses features of a
housekeeping gene.

GENE STRUCTURE

Tomatsu et al. (1989) demonstrated that the CYB5R3 gene is about 31 kb
long and contains 9 exons.

GENE FUNCTION

Straub et al. (2012) reported a new model for the regulation of nitric
oxide (NO) signaling by demonstrating that hemoglobin alpha, encoded by
the HBA1 (141800) and HBA2 (141850) genes, is expressed in human and
mouse arterial endothelial cells and enriched at the myoendothelial
junction, where it regulates the effects of NO on vascular reactivity.
Notably, this function is unique to hemoglobin alpha and is abrogated by
its genetic depletion. Mechanistically, endothelial hemoglobin alpha
heme iron in the Fe(3+) state permits NO signaling, and this signaling
is shut off when hemoglobin alpha is reduced to the Fe(2+) state by
endothelial CYB5R3. Genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of CYB5R3
increased NO bioactivity in small arteries. Straub et al. (2012)
concluded that their data revealed a mechanism by which the regulation
of the intracellular hemoglobin alpha oxidation state controls nitric
oxide synthase (NOS; see 163729) signaling in nonerythroid cells. The
authors suggested that this model may be relevant to heme-containing
globins in a broad range of NOS-containing somatic cells.

MAPPING

By study of rodent-human hybrids, Fisher et al. (1977) demonstrated that
the locus for NADH-diaphorase-1 (methemoglobin reductase; cytochrome b5
reductase) is on chromosome 22.

Bull et al. (1988) mapped the CYB5R3 gene to chromosome 22 by somatic
cell hybridization.

Narahara et al. (1992) described a 7-month-old girl with a terminal
deletion of chromosome 22: del(22)(q13.31). They demonstrated partial
deficiency of arylsulfatase A (ARSA; 607574) and normal levels of
CYB5R3, suggesting that the ARSA locus can be regionally assigned to
22q13.31-qter and the CYB5R3 locus excluded from the same segment.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Electrophoretic variants of red cell NADH-diaphorase were described by
Hopkinson et al. (1970). Data on gene frequencies of allelic variants
were tabulated by Roychoudhury and Nei (1988).

In sibs with type II methemoglobinemia (250800), characterized by
neurologic involvement, Kobayashi et al. (1990) identified a homozygous
mutation in the CYB5R3 gene (S128P; 613213.0001). Enzyme activity in
patient lymphoblastoid cells was reduced to 10% of normal.

In a patient with type I hereditary methemoglobinemia (250800),
characterized only by cyanosis and no neurologic involvement, Katsube et
al. (1991) found a homozygous mutation in the CYB5R3 gene (R58Q;
613213.0002). In an Italian patient with type I methemoglobinemia,
Shirabe et al. (1992) identified a homozygous mutation in the CYB5R3
gene (V106M; 613213.0004). The mutant enzyme was less heat stable than
the wildtype enzyme.

In 3 unrelated patients with severe recessive congenital
methemoglobinemia type II manifested by cyanosis in association with
severe mental retardation and neurologic impairment, Vieira et al.
(1995) identified homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the
CYB5R3 gene (613213.0006-613213.0009).

Percy et al. (2002) stated that 33 different mutations in the CYB5R3
gene causing autosomal recessive congenital methemoglobinemia had been
reported.

Maran et al. (2005) reported 4 unrelated patients with recessive
methemoglobinemia: 2 with type I and 2 with type II. Four different
mutations in the CYB5R3 gene were identified (see, e.g., 613213.0008 and
613218.0012). Methemoglobin levels ranged from 12 to 30%.

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

Shirabe (1997) pointed out that missense mutations found in patients
with type II methemoglobinemia are located close to the catalytic center
of the enzyme and the recombinant mutant enzymes have low catalytic
efficiency, whereas mutations in patients with type I are in the
marginal portion of the enzyme, which may only be detrimental to the
stability of the enzyme.

Aalfs et al. (2000) presented a diagram of the CYB5R3 gene showing the
location of 6 mutations that cause methemoglobinemia type I and 13
mutations that cause type II. It appeared that type II was more often
associated with full stops or deletions, whereas type I was more likely
to be associated with amino acid substitutions.

Dekker et al. (2001) investigated 7 families with methemoglobinemia type
I and found 7 novel mutations in the b5R gene. Six of these mutations
predicted amino acid substitutions at sites not involved in reduced NADH
or FAD binding. The seventh mutation, a splice site mutation leading to
skipping of exon 5 in mRNA, was present in heterozygous form together
with a missense mutation on the other allele. Two other substitutions
known to cause the type II form of the disease were found to affect the
consensus FAD-binding site directly or influence NADH binding
indirectly. These data supported the idea that enzyme inactivation is a
cause of type II disease, whereas enzyme instability may lead to the
type I form.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
METHEMOGLOBINEMIA, TYPE II
CYB5R3, SER128PRO

This variant, originally reported as SER127PRO, has been designated
SER128PRO based on revised numbering (Percy and Lappin, 2008).

In sibs with type II methemoglobinemia (250800), Kobayashi et al. (1990)
identified a homozygous 382T-C transition in exon 5 of the CYB5R3 gene,
resulting in a ser128-to-pro (S128P) substitution. Enzyme activity in
patient lymphoblastoid cells was reduced to 10% of normal controls, but
mRNA and protein were detectable. The mutation was predicted to be in an
alpha-helix structure that is part of a nucleotide-binding domain,
suggesting that it caused a significant conformation change and
functional enzyme deficiency.

Yubisui et al. (1991) prepared and characterized mutant enzymes in which
ser128 was replaced by pro (S128P) or by ala (S128A) by utilizing the
expression system of the soluble form of the enzyme in Escherichia coli
and by site-directed mutagenesis. The purified mutant enzymes showed
indistinguishable spectral properties, which differed from those of the
wildtype enzyme, and were less thermostable than the wildtype enzymes.
The results indicated that ser128 plays an important role in maintaining
the structure of the NADH-binding site in the enzyme. The numbering of
ser128 is for the membrane-bound form of b5R, which has 300 residues.
This variant was referred to as 'b5R Hiroshima.'

.0002
METHEMOGLOBINEMIA, TYPE I
CYB5R3, ARG58GLN

This variant, originally reported as ARG57GLN, has been designated
ARG58GLN based on revised numbering (Percy and Lappin, 2008).

In a patient with type I hereditary methemoglobinemia (250800), Katsube
et al. (1991) found a 173G-A transition in exon 3 of the CYB5R3 gene,
resulting in an arg58-to-gln (R58Q) substitution. The mutation abolished
the MspI recognition site. Homozygosity for the mutation was confirmed
by restriction analysis of PCR-amplified fragments and by dot-blot
hybridization of amplified products with allele-specific oligonucleotide
probes. This variant was referred to as 'b5R Toyoake.'

.0003
METHEMOGLOBINEMIA, TYPE I
CYB5R3, LEU149PRO

This variant, originally reported as LEU148PRO, has been designated
LEU149PRO based on revised numbering (Percy and Lappin, 2008).

In 2 Japanese brothers, born of consanguineous parents, with hereditary
methemoglobinemia (250800) without neurologic impairment (Tanishima et
al., 1985), Katsube et al. (1991) found a homozygous 446T-C transition
in exon 5 of the CYB5R3 gene, resulting in a leu148-to-pro (L148P)
substitution. The mutation generated a recognition site for MspI. This
variant was referred to as 'b5R Kurobe.' Deficiency of NADH cytochrome
b5 reductase was observed in lymphocytes and platelets as well as in
erythrocytes, but there was no associated mental retardation. Katsube et
al. (1991) referred to this as 'type III.'

By in vitro functional studies, Nagai et al. (1993) found that the
mutant L159P enzyme retained about 60% of the catalytic activity of
wildtype, but was remarkably heat unstable. Incubation of the mutant
enzyme at 42 degrees C for 10 minutes resulted in 80% loss of enzyme
activity, whereas the wildtype enzyme lost less than 20% activity after
incubation at 50 degrees C for 30 minutes. Another mutant in which
leu149 was replaced by ala also showed decreased heat stability compared
to wildtype, implying a structural role for leu149. Reinvestigation of
the enzyme activity in the blood cells and fibroblasts of the type III
Kurobe patient (Katsube et al., 1991) revealed that about 40% of the
normal activity was detectable in these cells, in contrast to the
previous report. Thus, these patients, previously reported as having
hereditary methemoglobinemia type III, were shown to have type I. This
indicated that the designation of a type III methemoglobinemia is not
necessary because the sole family with this type actually had type I
disease.

.0004
METHEMOGLOBINEMIA, TYPE I
CYB5R3, VAL106MET

This variant, originally reported as VAL105MET, has been designated
VAL106MET based on revised numbering (Percy and Lappin, 2008).

In an Italian patient with type I methemoglobinemia (250800), Shirabe et
al. (1992) identified a 316G-A transition in exon 4 of the CYB5R3 gene,
resulting in a val106-to-met (V106M) substitution. The mutant enzyme was
less heat stable than the wildtype enzyme.

.0005
METHEMOGLOBINEMIA, TYPE II
CYB5R3, IVS8AS, G-T, -1

In the cultured fibroblasts of a patient with generalized deficiency of
NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase (type II methemoglobinemia; 250800),
Shirabe et al. (1995) identified a homozygous G-to-T transversion in
intron 8 of the CYB5R3 gene, resulting in a splice site mutation and
complete absence of immunologically detectable enzyme in blood cells and
skin fibroblasts. The patient was the daughter of Italian second-cousin
parents. She had appeared cyanotic from the first days of life, and
showed failure to thrive and psychomotor developmental delay. At 1 year
of age, she had severe spastic and dystonic quadriparesis with
hyperkinetic involuntary movements, severe microcephaly, and very simple
and primitive reactions to environmental changes. She also developed
refractory seizures. At the age of 9 years, the patient was in a
vegetative status. Cultured fibroblasts of the patient showed severely
reduced NADH-dependent cytochrome c reductase, ferricyanide reductase,
and semidehydroascorbate reductase activities. The last activity is
known to be due to enzyme located on outer mitochondrial membranes;
thus, their results demonstrated that the reductase in the endoplasmic
reticulum and in the outer mitochondrial membranes are the product of
the same gene and suggested that a defect in ascorbate regeneration may
contribute to the phenotype of hereditary methemoglobinemia of the
generalized type.

METHEMOGLOBINEMIA, TYPE II
CYB5R3, IVS5DS, G-C, +8

In an Algerian patient born of consanguineous parents with type II
methemoglobinemia, Vieira et al. (1995) identified a deletion of exon 5
of the CYB5R3 gene resulting from a G-to-C transversion in intron 5 at
position +8, downstream from the 5-prime splice site of exon 5. Abnormal
splicing of the primary transcripts apparently resulted in a frameshift
with a premature stop codon. The patient was homozygous for the
mutation.

.0007
METHEMOGLOBINEMIA, TYPE II
CYB5R3, ARG219TER

This variant, originally reported as ARG218TER, has been designated
ARG219TER based on revised numbering (Percy and Lappin, 2008).

In an Algerian patient with clinical manifestations of congenital
methemoglobinemia type II (250800), Vieira et al. (1995) identified
homozygosity for an arg219-to-ter (R219X) substitution in exon 8 of the
CYB5R3 gene. The patient had profound mental retardation, microcephaly,
and bilateral athetosis associated with cyanosis and absent enzyme
activities in erythrocytes, lymphocytes, and lymphoblastoid cell lines,

.0008
METHEMOGLOBINEMIA, TYPE II
CYB5R3, CYS204ARG

This variant, originally reported as CYS203ARG, has been designated
CYS204ARG based on revised numbering (Percy and Lappin, 2008).

In a child with methemoglobinemia type II (250800), Vieira et al. (1995)
identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the CYB5R3 gene: a
T-to-C transition in exon 7 resulting in a cys204-to-arg (C204R)
substitution, and 3-bp deletion (met273del; 613213.0009). The diagnosis
was established at the age of 15 days on the basis of persistent
cyanosis and neurologic manifestations associated with complete enzyme
deficiency in erythrocytes and lymphocytes. Heterozygous levels of
enzyme were detected in both parents who were not related; the mother
was of Spanish ancestry and the father French. One allele carried a
missense mutation with replacement of cys203

Maran et al. (2005) reported a patient with type II methemoglobinemia
resulting from the C204R mutation. There was 30% methemoglobin; CYB5R3
activity was 50% in red blood cells and 25% in cultured lymphocytes.

.0009
METHEMOGLOBINEMIA, TYPE II
CYB5R3, 3-BP DEL, MET273DEL

This variant, originally reported as MET272DEL, has been designated
MET273DEL based on revised numbering (Percy and Lappin, 2008).

See 613213.0008 and Vieira et al. (1995).

.0010
METHEMOGLOBINEMIA, TYPE II
CYB5R3, 3-BP DEL, 895TTC

This variant, originally reported as PHE298DEL, has been designated
PHE299DEL based on revised numbering (Percy and Lappin, 2008).

In a Japanese patient from Yokohoma with type II methemoglobinemia
(250800), Shirabe et al. (1994) identified a homozygous 3-bp in-frame
deletion (895delTTC) in exon 9 of the CYB5R3 gene, resulting in a
deletion of phenylalanine at position 299. Although the mechanism
leading to the deletion was still controversial, the slipped mispairing
model was proposed as the most plausible one. The patient, of Japanese
origin from Yokohama, had retarded growth, mental retardation, and
cyanosis. The mutant enzyme activity was 0.4% that of wildtype and much
less thermostable.

.0011
NADH-CYTOCHROME b5 REDUCTASE POLYMORPHISM
CYB5R3, THR117SER

This variant, originally reported as THR116SER, has been designated
THR117SER based on revised numbering (Percy and Lappin, 2008).

Jenkins and Prchal (1997) claimed to have demonstrated the first
polymorphism in the CYB5R3 gene: a C-to-G transversion in exon 5,
resulting in a thr117-to-ser (T117S) substitution. The polymorphism was
found only in African Americans among whom 26 of 112 chromosomes showed
the G form, giving an allele frequency of 0.23. It was not found in 108
Caucasian, 46 Asian, 44 Indo-Aryan, or 14 Arabic chromosomes.
Preliminary studies indicated that the polymorphism did not correlate
with enzyme activity or produce any disease phenotype. It remained to be
determined whether this African-specific polymorphism that apparently
originated recently in human evolution provides any special survival
advantage.

.0012
METHEMOGLOBINEMIA, TYPE II
CYB5R3, IVS5AS, A-C, -2

In a 4-year-old boy with type II methemoglobinemia (250800), Owen et al.
(1997) identified a homozygous in-frame deletion of exon 6 that resulted
in the deletion of 28 amino acids (codons 155 to 182). A homozygous
A-to-C transversion of the invariant AG dinucleotide of the intron 5
splice acceptor site was discovered and considered to be consistent with
skipping of exon 6. The patient had dystonic athetoid cerebral palsy
with mental retardation and microcephaly. He was found to have 60%
methemoglobin that was persistent but responded to ascorbic acid
treatment.

Maran et al. (2005) reported a patient with type II methemoglobinemia
resulting from the IVS5AS splice site mutation. The patient had 20%
methemoglobin. Four different mRNA transcripts were identified: a normal
transcript, an in-frame skipping of exon 6, and 2 transcripts with
partial inclusion of intron 6. Overall, mRNA levels were 7% of normal
controls. CYB5R3 activity was 2% of controls in red blood cells and 25%
in cultured lymphocytes.

.0013
METHEMOGLOBINEMIA, TYPE I
CYB5R3, LEU73PRO

This variant, originally reported as LEU72PRO, has been designated
LEU73PRO based on revised numbering (Percy and Lappin, 2008).

In a 3-year-old Chinese girl with type I methemoglobinemia (230800), Wu
et al. (1998) identified a homozygous T-to-C transition in the CYB5R3
gene, resulting in a leu73-to-pro (L73P) substitution. The patient was
born after normal pregnancy and delivery. From the age of 1 month she
appeared persistently cyanosed, but without mental or neurologic
abnormalities, and her respiratory and cardiac functions were normal.
The concentration of methemoglobin was 15%, and NADH-cytochrome b5R
activity in erythrocytes was decreased. Her 5-year-old brother had the
same symptoms with 14.5% methemoglobin and decreased b5R activity. The
unaffected parents had heterozygous levels of enzyme activity in red
cells (about 65% of normal controls).

.0014
METHEMOGLOBINEMIA, TYPE II
CYB5R3, GLN77TER

In a patient with methemoglobinemia type II (250800), Aalfs et al.
(2000) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 nonsense mutations in
the CYB5R3 gene: a gln77-to-ter (Q77X) mutation in exon 4 and an
arg160-to-ter mutation (R160X; 613213.0015) in exon 6. The affected
child, born of healthy, unrelated Hindustani Suriname parents, was small
for gestational age. Central cyanosis was noted shortly after birth. She
showed severe psychomotor retardation and microcephaly. There were
athetoid movements, generalized hypertonia, epilepsy, and a complete
head lag. At 6 years of age, MRI of the brain demonstrated frontal and
bitemporal cortical atrophy, cerebellar atrophy, retarded myelin
development, and hypoplasia of the basal ganglia. There was almost no
psychomotor development and spastic tetraplegia with scoliosis was
becoming evident. The patient died at the age of 8 years.

.0015
METHEMOGLOBINEMIA, TYPE II
CYB5R3, ARG160TER

See (613213.0014) and Aalfs et al. (2000).

.0016
METHEMOGLOBINEMIA, TYPE I
CYB5R3, CYS204TYR

This variant, originally reported as CYS203TYR, has been designated
CYS204TYR based on revised numbering (Percy and Lappin, 2008).

In a Chinese family, Wang et al. (2000) found that type I recessive
congenital methemoglobinemia (250800) was caused by homozygosity for a
G-to-A transition in exon 7 of the CYB5R3 gene, resulting in a
cys204-to-tyr (C204Y) substitution. A previously identified mutation in
the same codon, C204R (613213.0008), led to type II methemoglobinemia.
The milder manifestations in the patients studied by Wang et al. (2000)
was thought to be due to the fact that the catalytic activity of the
enzyme was not much affected, although the mutant enzyme exhibited
decreased heat stability and increased susceptibility to trypsin.

.0017
METHEMOGLOBINEMIA, TYPE I
CYB5R3, GLY292ASP

This variant, originally reported as GLY291ASP, has been designated
GLY292ASP based on revised numbering (Percy and Lappin, 2008).

In 1 of the original patients with type I recessive congenital
methemoglobulinemia (250800) from the studies of Deeny et al. (1943) and
Gibson (1948), Percy et al. (2002) identified heterozygosity for 2 novel
mutations in exon 9 of the CYB5R3 gene: a G-to-A transition predicting a
gly292-to-asp (G292D) substitution, and a 3-bp in-frame deletion of
codon 255 (GAG) (613213.0018), predicting loss of glutamic acid. Both
mutations occurred in the carboxyl-terminal NADH-binding lobe of the
protein. Using functional expression studies, Percy et al. (2005) showed
that the mutant G292D enzyme retained approximately 58% of residual
enzyme activity.

.0018
METHEMOGLOBINEMIA, TYPE I
CYB5R3, GLU256DEL

This variant, originally reported as GLU255DEL, has been designated
GLU256DEL based on revised numbering (Percy and Lappin, 2008).

See Percy et al. (2002) and 613213.0017. Using functional expression
studies, Percy et al. (2005) showed that the E256 deletion enzyme
retained approximately 38% of residual enzyme activity.

.0019
METHEMOGLOBINEMIA, TYPE I
CYB5R3, ASP240GLY

This variant, originally reported as ASP239GLY, has been designated
ASP240GLY based on revised numbering (Percy and Lappin, 2008).

In an Irish patient with type I methemoglobulinemia (250800), Percy et
al. (2005) identified a homozygous A-to-G transition in exon 8 of the
CYB5R3 gene, resulting in an asp240-to-gly (D240G) substitution within
the carboxyl-terminal NADH-binding lobe of the protein. In an unrelated
Irish family, 2 sibs with type I methemoglobulinemia were compound
heterozygous for the D240G mutation and another CYB5R3 mutation.
Functional expression studies showed that the D240G mutation retained
substantial enzyme activity, but had perturbed substrate binding,
causing both decreased specificity for NADH and increased specificity
for NADPH.

;;E2F DIMERIZATION PARTNER 2; DP2
DESCRIPTION Zhang and Chellappan (1995) cloned an E2F dimerization partner,
transcription factor DP2, from a human kidney cDNA library. The TFDP2
gene encodes a predicted 386-amino acid protein that is 68% identical to
TFDP1 (189902). Northern blot analysis revealed 5 distinct transcript
sizes ranging from 1.4 to 9.5 kb, with expression of at least one size
observed in all cell lines tested. TFDP2 is able to form a functional
heterodimer with E2F1 (189971).

Zhang et al. (1997) used fluorescence in situ hybridization to map the
TFDP2 gene to human chromosome 3q23.

607226	TITLE *607226 HISTONE DEACETYLASE 11; HDAC11
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Histone deacetylases, such as HDAC11, control DNA expression by
modifying the core histone octamers that package DNA into dense
chromatin structures and repress gene expression.

CLONING

By searching an EST database using the yeast HOS3 sequence as query,
followed by PCR using human dermal fibroblast cDNA as template, Gao et
al. (2002) cloned HDAC11. The deduced 347-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 39 kD and contains 9 deacetylase motifs
shared by both class I and class II HDACs. The putative catalytic core
region includes invariant active site residues shared by eukaryotic
HDACs. Northern blot analysis revealed a 1.7-kb transcript,
corresponding to the 347-amino acid protein, and a more abundant 3.2-kb
transcript. Expression was highest in brain, heart, skeletal muscle, and
kidney. Real-time PCR also revealed high expression of HDAC11 in testis.
HDAC11 partitioned with nuclear extracts following cell fractionation of
transfected 293 cells.

GENE FUNCTION

By in vitro assays of immunopurified recombinant HDAC11, Gao et al.
(2002) confirmed that HDAC11 has HDAC activity and that the activity is
inhibitable by trapoxin, an HDAC inhibitor. In coimmunoprecipitation
experiments, HDAC11 interacted with HDA6 (300272), but not with RbAp48
(RBBP4; 602923), NCOR (see 600848), SMART, or mouse Sin3a (607776).

GENE STRUCTURE

Gao et al. (2002) determined that the HDAC11 gene contains 9 exons and
spans about 25 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Gao et al. (2002) mapped the HDAC11 gene
to chromosome 3p25.2.

;;GLUTATHIONE S-TRANSFERASE M5;;
GLUTATHIONE S-TRANSFERASE, CLASS MU, 5
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The glutathione S-transferases (GST; EC 2.5.1.18) are dimeric enzymes
that metabolize a broad range of xenobiotics and carcinogens. They are
encoded by several multigene families. See GSTM1 (138350) for additional
background.

CLONING

By screening a human frontal cortex cDNA library with a rat cDNA that
cross-hybridized with other rodent and human mu class GST cDNAs,
Takahashi et al. (1993) isolated a cDNA encoding GSTM5. Northern blot
analysis revealed that GSTM5 is expressed primarily in brain and lung
and to a lesser extent in heart. The GSTM5 gene encodes a predicted
217-amino acid protein. By Western blot analysis using antibodies
against the unique C-terminal region of GSTM5, Takahashi et al. (1993)
detected GSTM5 in brain and testis but not liver.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Pearson et al. (1993) mapped the
GSTM5 gene and 4 other mu GST genes to 1p13.3. Xu et al. (1998) reported
that 4 mu GST genes are tightly clustered. These genes are spaced
approximately 20 kb apart and are arranged as: 5-prime--GSTM4
(138333)--GSTM2 (138380)--GSTM1--GSTM5--3-prime.

<Pseudogene>

Scott (2009) stated that genomic sequence comparisons indicate that the
class mu GST gene identified by Islam et al. (1989) on chromosome 3 and
symbolized GSTM1L is in fact a pseudogene of GSTM5.

603644	TITLE *603644 SCO1, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; SCO1
;;CYTOCHROME OXIDASE-DEFICIENT 1, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; SCOD1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Cytochrome c oxidase (COX; EC 1.9.3.1), the terminal component of the
mitochondrial respiratory chain, is a multiheteromeric enzyme embedded
in the mitochondrial inner membrane. COX consists of a protein backbone
bound to 2 copper-containing prosthetic groups, the cytochromes a and
a-3. In humans, COX is composed of 13 subunits. In S. cerevisiae,
mutations in the sco1 gene lead to a lack of COX subunit II. The sco1
protein is a constituent of the inner mitochondrial membrane and is
thought to play a role in either mitochondrial copper transport or
insertion of copper into the active site of COX. By searching an EST
database for sequences related to sco1, Petruzzella et al. (1998)
identified a cDNA encoding human SCOD1. The predicted 301-amino acid
human protein shares 34% identity with yeast sco1. SCOD1 contains a
mitochondrial leader peptide, a putative transmembrane domain, and a
copper-binding domain. In vitro mitochondrial import and
trypsin-protection assays demonstrated that the SCOD1 protein is
targeted to mitochondria. Northern blot analysis revealed that SCOD1 is
predominantly expressed in tissues characterized by high rates of
oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), including muscle, heart, and brain.

GENE FUNCTION

Leary et al. (2004) characterized the mitochondrial copper delivery
pathway in SCO1 and SCO2 (604272) patient backgrounds. Immunoblot
analysis of patient cell lines showed reduced levels of the mutant
proteins, resulting in a defect in COX assembly, and the appearance of a
common assembly intermediate. Overexpression of the metallochaperone
COX17 (604813) rescued the COX deficiency in SCO2 patient cells but not
in SCO1 patient cells. Overexpression of either wildtype SCO protein in
the reciprocal patient background resulted in a dominant-negative
phenotype, suggesting a physical interaction between SCO1 and SCO2.
Chimeric proteins, constructed from the C-terminal copper-binding and
N-terminal matrix domains of the 2 SCO proteins, failed to complement
the COX deficiency in either patient background, but mapped the
dominant-negative phenotype in the SCO2 background to the N-terminal
domain of SCO1, the most divergent part of the 2 SCO proteins. Leary et
al. (2004) concluded that the human SCO proteins have nonoverlapping,
cooperative functions in mitochondrial copper delivery.

Human SCO1 and SCO2 code for essential metallochaperones with
ill-defined functions in the biogenesis of the CuA site of cytochrome c
oxidase subunit II (COII) (MTCO2; 516040). Leary et al. (2009) used
patient cell lines to demonstrate that the synthesis of COII was reduced
in SCO2-mutant, but not in SCO1-mutant, cells. Despite this biosynthetic
defect, newly synthesized COII was more stable in SCO2-mutant cells than
in control cells. RNAi-mediated knockdown of mutant SCO2 abolished COII
labeling in a translation assay, whereas knockdown of mutant SCO1 did
not affect COII synthesis. These results indicated that SCO2 acts
upstream of SCO1 and that SCO2 is indispensable for COII synthesis. The
subsequent maturation of COII was contingent upon the formation of a
complex that included both SCO proteins, each with a functional CxxxC
copper-coordinating motif. In control cells, the cysteines in this motif
in SCO1 existed as a mixed population comprised of oxidized disulfides
and reduced thiols; however, the relative ratio of oxidized to reduced
cysteines in SCO1 was perturbed in cells from both SCO backgrounds.
Overexpression of wildtype SCO2, or knockdown of mutant SCO2, in
SCO2-mutant cells altered the ratio of oxidized to reduced cysteines in
SCO1, suggesting that SCO2 acts as a thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase to
oxidize the copper-coordinating cysteines in SCO1 during COII
maturation. Leary et al. (2009) presented a model in which each SCO
protein fulfills distinct, stage-specific functions during COII
synthesis and CuA site maturation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Horvath et al. (2000) determined that the SCO1 gene contains 6 exons and
spans approximately 17 kb.

MAPPING

The Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the SCO1 gene to
chromosome 17 (TMAP WI-12826). Based on sequence similarity to ESTs,
Petruzzella et al. (1998) mapped the SCO1 gene to 17p13-p12.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Studying a large family with multiple cases of neonatal ketoacidotic
coma and isolated COX deficiency (220110), Valnot et al. (2000) mapped
the disease locus to 17p13.1, in a region encompassing 2 candidate genes
involved in COX assembly: SCO1 and COX10 (602125). Mutation screening
showed compound heterozygosity for SCO1 gene mutations in the patients:
a 2-bp frameshift deletion (363insGA; 603644.0001) inherited from the
father and a pro174-to-leu missense mutation (P174L; 603644.0002)
inherited from the mother. The clinical presentation of the patients
differed markedly from that of patients harboring mutations in other COX
assembly and/or maturation genes, e.g., SURF1 (185620), SCO2, and COX10.

SCO1, 2-BP DEL, 363GA

Valnot et al. (2000) described 4 male sibs with mitochondrial cytochrome
c oxidase deficiency (220110) due to compound heterozygosity for
mutations in the SCO1 gene. From the father they inherited a 2-bp
frameshift deletion of nucleotides 363 and 364 in exon 2, resulting in
both a premature stop codon and a highly unstable mRNA. From the mother
they inherited a 520C-T transition in exon 3 that changed a highly
conserved proline into a leucine (P174L; 603644.0002). This proline,
adjacent to the copper-binding domain of SCO1, was thought to play a
crucial role in the tridimensional structure of the domain. The clinical
presentation of the patients differed markedly from that of patients
harboring mutations in other COX assembly and/or maturation genes, e.g.,
SURF1, SCO2, and COX10. They presented with a severe neurologic disorder
from birth and metabolic acidosis. One patient died at age 2 months; a
second at the age of 5 days. Histopathologic studies of the liver showed
swollen hepatocytes with microvesicular lipid vacuoles and panlobular
steatosis. A muscle biopsy sample showed an accumulation of lipid
droplets.

600960	TITLE *600960 SET TRANSLOCATION, MYELOID LEUKEMIA-ASSOCIATED; SET
;;INHIBITOR OF GZMA-ACTIVATED DNase; IGAAD
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The translocation (6;9)(p23q34) is the hallmark of a specific subtype of
acute myeloid leukemia (AML) characterized by a poor prognosis and a
young age of onset. It is classified in the French-American-British
(FAB) system mostly as M2/M4 and rarely as M1 or refractive anemia with
excess of blast cells (RAEB). On chromosome 9, breakpoints take place in
a specific intron, denoted icb-9, of a large gene named Cain (CAN;
114350). On chromosome 6, breakpoints occur in a single intron, icb-6,
of a gene named DEK (125264). In a patient with acute undifferentiated
leukemia and an apparently normal karyotype, von Lindern et al. (1992)
found a breakpoint in icb-9 of the CAN gene in a bone marrow sample but
detected no breakpoint in DEK. They isolated and characterized a novel
gene, named SET (suppressor of variegation, enhancer of zeste, and
Trithorax), that was fused to CAN in the leukemic cells of this patient.
A chimeric SET-CAN transcript whose sequence predicted a fusion protein
of 155 kD was detected. The SET gene encodes transcripts of 2.0 and 2.7
kb that result from the use of alternative polyadenylation sites. Both
transcripts contained the open reading frame for a putative protein with
a predicted molecular mass of 32 kD. The SET sequence showed homology
with the yeast nucleosome assembly protein NAP-I. The only common
sequence motif of SET and DEK proteins is an acidic region. SET has a
long acidic tail, of which a large part is present in the predicted
SET-CAN fusion protein.

GENE FUNCTION

Carlson et al. (1998) studied the role of SET in the regulation of renal
cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. The mRNA encoding SET was
expressed at much higher levels in transformed human and rodent cell
lines than in cultured renal epithelial and primary endothelial cells.
Consistent with a role for SET in cell proliferation, SET mRNA
expression was markedly reduced in cells rendered quiescent by serum
starvation, contact inhibition, or differentiation. Previous findings
during renal development were extended by demonstrating that SET protein
expression is also much greater in developing rat and human kidney than
in fully differentiated, mature kidney. Finally, high levels of SET mRNA
and SET protein expression were found in Wilms tumor but not in renal
cell carcinoma, adult polycystic kidney disease, or in transitional cell
carcinoma. The SET domain (Tschiersch et al., 1994) is found in proteins
that are involved in embryonic development (Tripoulas et al., 1996).

Granzyme A (GZMA; 140050) induces a caspase-independent cell death
pathway characterized by single-stranded DNA nicks and other features of
apoptosis. A GZMA-activated DNase (GAAD) is in an endoplasmic
reticulum-associated complex containing pp32 (600832) and the GZMA
substrates SET, HMG2 (163906), and APE1 (107748). Fan et al. (2003)
showed that GAAD is NM23H1 (156490), a nucleoside diphosphate kinase
implicated in suppression of tumor metastasis, and its specific
inhibitor (IGAAD) is SET. NM23H1 bound SET and was released from
inhibition by GZMA cleavage of SET. After GZMA loading or cytotoxic T
lymphocyte attack, SET and NM23H1 translocated to the nucleus and SET
was degraded, allowing NM23H1 to nick chromosomal DNA. GZMA-treated
cells with silenced NM23H1 expression were resistant to GZMA-mediated
DNA damage and cytolysis, while cells overexpressing NM23H1 were more
sensitive.

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis using the N-terminal 277 amino acids of SET
as bait, Minakuchi et al. (2001) identified SET-binding protein-1
(SETBP1; 611060). Deletion and mutagenesis analysis revealed that amino
acids 182 to 223 of SET interacted with amino acids 1238 to 1434 of
SETBP1. Immunoprecipitation analysis verified that SETBP1 interacted
with endogenous SET in a human osteosarcoma cell line.

Ischemia and seizure cause excessive neuronal excitation that is
associated with brain acidosis and neuronal cell death. Liu et al.
(2008) found that the neurotoxin kainic acid activated lysosomal
asparagine endopeptidase (AEP, or LGMN; 602620) in mouse brain and
triggered degradation of Set, followed by DNA nicking and neuronal cell
death. Pike-L (CENTG1; 605476) strongly bound Set in the nucleus and
protected Set from proteolytic cleavage by Aep in vitro and in vivo,
thereby diminishing DNA damage and neuronal cell death. Kainic acid or
stroke failed to provoke DNA nicking and neuronal cell death in
Aep-deficient mice.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, von Lindern et al. (1992)
assigned the SET gene to 9q34, centromeric of ABL (189980).

KERATIN, HARD, TYPE I, 7; HA7
DESCRIPTION See KRTHA1 (601077) for general information on hair keratins.

Rogers et al. (1998) isolated and characterized 2 overlapping human PAC
clones that cover 190 kb on 17q12-q21. These clones contain 9 type I
hair keratin genes, including the novel genes KRTHA7 and KRTHA8
(604542); 1 transcribed hair keratin pseudogene; and 1 orphan exon. The
order of the genes is 5-prime--KRTHA6 (604540)--KRTHA5 (602764)--KRTHA2
(602760)--orphan exon--KRTHA8--KRTHA7--pseudogene--KRTHA1--KRTHA4
(602763)--KRTHA3B (602762)--KRTHA3A (602761)--3-prime. The hair keratin
genes range in size from 4.2 to 7.5 kb, and the genes are separated from
each other by 5.5 to 18.4 kb; all are located within about 140 kb. Each
gene is transcribed from the 5-prime to 3-prime direction. Based on
sequence homologies, the genes can be grouped into 3 subclusters of
tandemly arranged genes. One subcluster, group A, consists of KRTHA1,
KRTHA3A, KRTHA3B, and KRTHA4, which share 89% overall amino acid
identity. A second subcluster, group B, contains KRTHA7 and KRTHA8, as
well as the hair keratin pseudogene, which the authors called HAA. The
functional hair keratins and hypothetical HAA hair keratin share
approximately 81% overall amino acid identity. Due to an almost
completely identical head domain, KRTHA7 and KRTHA8 are 92.6% identical.
The third subcluster, group C, consists of the structurally less related
hair keratins KRTHA2, KRTHA5, and KRTHA6, which share about 70% amino
acid identity.

Rogers et al. (1998) found that the deduced KRTHA7 protein, which they
called HA7, has 408 amino acids. The KRTHA7 gene contains 7 exons. By
RT-PCR, Rogers et al. (1998) showed that KRTHA7 is expressed in the
human hair follicle. See Langbein et al. (1999) for further details on
the expression pattern of the KRTHA7 gene in the hair follicle.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Acetylation and deacetylation, mediated by histone acetyltransferases,
such as HAT1 (603053), and histone deacetylases, such as HDAC9, play a
role in the regulation of gene expression.

CLONING

By screening for cDNAs encoding large proteins expressed in brain,
Nagase et al. (1998) identified a partial cDNA encoding HDAC9, which
they termed KIAA0744. The deduced 590-amino acid protein is 53%
identical to the N terminus of KIAA0288 (HDAC4; 605314). RT-PCR analysis
detected highest expression in brain, lower expression in heart and
smooth muscle, and little or no expression in other tissues.

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen with frog Mef2d (see 600663), Sparrow et
al. (1999) obtained mouse Mitr (Mef2-interacting transcriptional
repressor) and its human homolog, MITR, which is identical to KIAA0744
and lacks a C-terminal HDAC domain. Functional analysis showed that MITR
acts as a trichostatin A (TSA)-sensitive repressor of transcription and
that it interacts directly with HDAC1 (601241).

By RACE-PCR of brain cDNA with primers designed from the putative HDAC
domain on chromosome 7 downstream of MITR, Zhou et al. (2001) isolated
cDNAs encoding full-length HDAC9 and a shorter isoform, termed HDAC9A.
They referred to MITR as HDRP (histone deacetylase 4/5-related protein).
Sequence analysis predicted that the longer isoform contains 1,011 amino
acids and an HDAC domain, whereas HDAC9A possesses 879 amino acids
lacking 132 residues at the C terminus. Northern blot analysis revealed
ubiquitous but variable expression of 9.8- and 4.1-kb transcripts.
RT-PCR analysis detected preferential expression of HDAC9 in brain,
heart, and pancreas, whereas HDAC9A predominates in lung, liver, and
skeletal muscle. Expression is equivalent in placenta and kidney.
Functional analysis showed that both isoforms have comparable
TSA-inhibitable HDAC activity but much less activity than HDAC4. Western
blot analysis indicated that HDAC9 and HDAC9A, like MITR, specifically
repress MEF2C (600662)-mediated transcriptional activation. Zhou et al.
(2001) concluded that there are at least 6 splice variants of HDAC9,
including isoforms that lack the nuclear localization signal encoded by
exon 7.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Sparrow et al. (1999) determined that MITR
contains 12 exons covering a total of 173 kb on chromosome 7. They noted
the presence of a sequence potentially encoding an HDAC domain 56 kb
downstream of the MITR 3-prime UTR, indicating that the total locus is
454 kb long. Zhou et al. (2001) determined that the full-length gene
contains 23 exons spanning 458 kb. They also explained the variable exon
usage of the different HDAC9 isoforms.

GENE FUNCTION

Youn et al. (2000) reported that HDAC4 and MITR contain calmodulin
(114180)-binding domains that overlap with their MEF2 binding domains.
Binding of calmodulin to HDAC4 leads to its dissociation from MEF2,
relieving MEF2 from the transcriptional repression by HDAC4. Together,
HDAC4, MITR, and CABIN1 (604251) constitute a family of
calcium-sensitive transcriptional repressors of MEF2.

Electrical activity arising from motor innervation controls the
expression of many skeletal muscle genes. Mejat et al. (2005) showed
that Hdac9 is a signal-responsive transcriptional repressor in mouse
skeletal muscle that is downregulated upon denervation, with consequent
upregulation of chromatin acetylation and acetylcholine receptor (AChR;
see 100690) expression. Preventing Hdac9 downregulation in denervated
muscle abrogated both histone hyperacetylation and activation of the
myogenin (MYOG; 159980) and AChR genes. Inhibition of activity-dependent
genes and chromatin acetylation by electrical activity and Hdac9 was
mediated by Mef2, Hdac1, and Hdac3 (605166). Mejat et al. (2005)
concluded that HDAC9 mediates the effect of neuron-elicited electrical
activity on activity-responsive genes by governing the acetylation state
of chromatin.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the HDAC9 gene
to chromosome 7. By database analyses, Zhou et al. (2001) refined the
localization to chromosome 7p21-p15.

615168	TITLE *615168 ARCHAELYSIN FAMILY METALLOPEPTIDASE 1; AMZ1
;;ARCHAEMETZINCIN 1;;
KIAA1950
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

AMZ1 shares sequence similarity with archaeal metalloproteases called
archaemetzincins, but it appears to act predominantly as a basic
aminopeptidase (Diaz-Perales et al., 2005).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2001) cloned AMZ1, which they designated
KIAA1950. The transcript contains several repetitive elements in its
3-prime end. The deduced protein contains 535 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA
detected AMZ1 expression in adult and fetal brain and in all adult brain
regions examined. Lower expression was detected in adult lung, liver,
spleen, and ovary and in fetal liver, with little to no expression in
adult heart, skeletal muscle kidney, pancreas, and testis.

By searching databases for sequences similar to archaeal or bacterial
metalloproteases, followed by PCR of a brain cDNA library, Diaz-Perales
et al. (2005) cloned human AMZ1 and AMZ2 (615169). The deduced 498-amino
acid AMZ1 protein contains a catalytic domain related to neutral zinc
metalloproteases. The core catalytic motif of AMZ1 contains 4 cysteines
and 2 histidines conserved among archaemetzincins, but it lacks a third
conserved histidine found in all other archaemetzincins, including human
and rodent AMZ2. Northern blot analysis of 15 human tissues detected
AMZ1 transcripts of 1.2, 1.3, 1.7, and 1.8 kb predominantly in liver and
heart, with lower expression in adult pancreas, kidney, and testis. AMZ1
was also detected in all fetal tissues examined (kidney, liver, lung,
and brain).

GENE FUNCTION

By assaying recombinant protein expressed in E. coli, Diaz-Perales et
al. (2005) found that the isolated catalytic domain of AMZ1 (amino acids
1 to 320) showed significant hydrolytic activity against the synthetic
substrate alanine-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (ala-AMC), with much lower
activity with arg-AMC, and little to no activity with other synthetic
substrates examined. The AMZ1 catalytic domain showed a pH optimum of
8.0. AMZ1 exhibited aminopeptidase activity against neurogranin (NRGN;
602350), but not against angiotensins (see 106150), common
metallopeptidase substrates, or protein substrates. Activity was
inhibited by an aminopeptidase inhibitor and a general metalloprotease
inhibitor, but not by other metalloprotease inhibitors or inhibitors of
other protease classes.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Diaz-Perales et al. (2005) mapped the AMZ1
gene to chromosome 7p22.3.

EVOLUTION

By database analysis, Diaz-Perales et al. (2005) identified AMZ genes in
vertebrates and some fungi, but not in most bacterial species or model
organisms, such as C. elegans, S. cerevisiae, D. melanogaster, and A.
thaliana. The primordial AMZ gene, which is most related to the current
AMZ2 gene, arose in a common ancestor of archaeal and eukaryotic
organisms. Some bacterial species appeared to acquire an AMZ gene
through lateral gene transfer from archaeal organisms. Eukaryotic AMZ1
diverged from AMZ2 recently, probably by gene duplication.

;;CYTOCHROME P450, SUBFAMILY XXIV; CYP24;;
1,25-@DIHYDROXYVITAMIN D3 24-HYDROXYLASE;;
VITAMIN D 24-HYDROXYLASE
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3, the physiologically active form of vitamin D3,
exerts its functions through a receptor (VDR; 601769)-mediated
mechanism. In addition to its fundamental role in calcium metabolism,
1,25-(OH)2D3 acts on a variety of tissues. One of its most important
functions is its differentiating activity. The best-characterized
incidence of this activity is induction of differentiation of
promyelocytes into monocytes/macrophages. 1,25-(OH)2D3 is biologically
inactivated through a series of reactions beginning with
24-hydroxylation. 1,25-(OH)2D3 induces the 24-hydroxylase, whereas
hypocalcemia, through increased parathyroid hormone, suppresses this
enzyme. Chen et al. (1993) isolated the cDNA encoding the human
24-hydroxylase, sequenced it, and demonstrated that it is active when
expressed in genetic expression systems.

Vitamin D 24-hydroxylase is a mitochondrial enzyme responsible for
inactivating vitamin D metabolites through the C-24 oxidation pathway.
Ohyama et al. (1991) isolated a cDNA encoding 25-hydroxyvitamin
D(3)24-hydroxylase from a rat kidney cDNA library by use of specific
antibodies to the enzyme. The amino acid sequence showed less than 30%
similarity to those of previously reported cytochrome P450s.

Labuda et al. (1993) cloned part of the CYP24 gene: 776 bp of the coding
and 720 bp of the 3-prime untranslated region interrupted by an intron.
In the coding region, they found 79.8% similarity in DNA and 87.5%
similarity in deduced amino acid sequence between human and rat, with no
similarity in the 3-prime untranslated region.

Independently, Hahn et al. (1993) isolated a human kidney cDNA clone for
vitamin D 24-hydroxylase.

GENE STRUCTURE

Chen and DeLuca (1995) determined that the promoter region of CYP24
contains a TATA box, a CAAT box, GC boxes, 2 vitamin D-responsive
elements (VDREs), and AP1 (165160)- and AP2 (107580)-binding sites.
Functional characterization of the VDREs indicated that both are
required for optimal induction of CYP24 expression by
1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3.

MAPPING

By Southern blot hybridization of DNA from human-hamster somatic cell
hybrids and by in situ immunofluorescence hybridization, Labuda et al.
(1993) mapped the CYP24 gene to 20q13.1. Hahn et al. (1993) mapped the
CYP24 gene to 20q13.2-q13.3 by fluorescence in situ hybridization.

By study of an interspecific backcross, Malas et al. (1994) demonstrated
that the mouse homolog is located on chromosome 2 in a region of
conserved synteny with human chromosome 20.

GENE FUNCTION

Using DNA microarray and quantitative PCR analyses, Liu et al. (2006)
found that activation of TLR2 (603028) and TLR1 (601194) by a
mycobacterial ligand upregulated expression of VDR and CYP27B1 (609506),
the vitamin D 1-hydroxylase that catalyzes the conversion of vitamin D
to its active form, in monocytes and macrophages, but not dendritic
cells. Intracellular flow cytometric and quantitative PCR analyses
showed that treatment of monocytes with vitamin D upregulated expression
of CYP24 and cathelicidin (CAMP; 600474), an antimicrobial peptide, but
not DEFB4 (602215). Confocal microscopy demonstrated colocalization of
CAMP with bacteria-containing vacuoles of vitamin D-treated monocytes,
and vitamin D treatment of M. tuberculosis-infected macrophages reduced
the number of viable bacilli. Ligand stimulation of TLR2 and TLR1
upregulated CYP24 and CAMP in the presence of human serum, but not
bovine serum, and CAMP upregulation was more efficient in Caucasian than
in African American serum, in which vitamin D levels were significantly
lower. Vitamin D supplementation of African American serum reversed the
CAMP induction defect. Liu et al. (2006) proposed that vitamin D
supplementation in African and Asian populations, which may have a
reduced ability to synthesize vitamin D from ultraviolet light in
sunlight, might be an effective and inexpensive intervention to enhance
innate immunity against microbial infection and neoplastic disease.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Using array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), Albertson et al.
(2000) resolved 2 regions of amplification within an approximately 2-Mb
region of recurrent aberration at 20q13.2 in breast cancer (114480). The
putative oncogene ZNF217 (602967) mapped to one peak, and CYP24, whose
overexpression is likely to lead to abrogation of growth control
mediated by vitamin D, mapped to the other. Fine mapping demonstrated
that ZNF217 lies proximal to CYP24. As transcription of CYP24 is closely
coupled to the level and activity of VDR, Albertson et al. (2000)
measured both CYP24 and VDR transcript levels using quantitative PCR in
breast tumors. Expression of CYP24, normalized with respect to VDR,
correlated with copy number of CYP24 in the tumors, further supporting
an oncogenic role for CYP24.

In 7 patients from 8 unrelated families with infantile hypercalcemia
(143880), Schlingmann et al. (2011) identified homozygosity or compound
heterozygosity for mutations in the CYP24A1 gene (see, e.g.,
126065.0001-126065.0007). In 1 patient, a heterozygous complex deletion
in CYP24A1 was identified, but no other mutation was detected by
sequence analysis. Overexpression of the mutant CYP24A1 enzymes in a
eukaryotic cell line revealed complete or near-complete loss of function
for all identified mutations.

In molecular-modeling simulations, Ji and Shen (2011) found that among
the 4 missense mutations reported by Schlingmann et al. (2011), only
L409S (126065.0006) weakens the binding of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 to
24-hydroxylase. Noting that the catabolism of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3
by 24-hydroxylase is heme-dependent, Ji and Shen (2011) analyzed the
influence of these mutations on heme binding and found that the other 3
mutations, R159Q (126065.0004), R396W (126065.0005), and E322K
(126065.0007), all change interactions between the heme molecule and
24-hydroxylase.

In a 47-year-old man who had an episode of nephrolithiasis at 19 years
of age and was subsequently asymptomatic until hypercalcemia was
discovered on routine testing at 39 years of age, Streeten et al. (2011)
identified homozygosity for a 3-bp deletion in the CYP24A1 gene
(E143del; 126065.0002). Streeten et al. (2011) noted that this mutation
had been identified by Schlingmann et al. (2011) in patients with
infantile hypercalcemia. Noting that vitamin D prophylaxis was a factor
in the development of symptomatic hypercalcemia in the children reported
by Schlingmann et al. (2011), Schlingmann et al. (2011) suggested that
information on lifestyle, nutrition, and vitamin supplementation in the
patient described by Streeten et al. (2011) might identify a potential
trigger for clinical symptoms in adulthood.

OTHER FEATURES

Ogunkolade et al. (2006) hypothesized that chewing betel nut, an
addictive habit common throughout South Asian communities, contributes
to hypovitaminosis D by modulating the enzymes regulating circulating
activated vitamin D (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D) concentration. Peripheral
blood mononuclear cell 24-hydoxylase (CYP24A1) mRNA correlated
positively and serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D negatively with betel quids
per day. Betel chewing is a more powerful independent determinant of
increased 24-hydoxylase expression and of decreased serum calcitriol
than serum 25-dihydroxyvitamin D, supporting the hypothesis that this
habit could aggravate the effects of vitamin D deficiency.

ANIMAL MODEL

Kasuga et al. (2002) found that transgenic rats constitutively
expressing CYP24 showed significantly low levels of plasma
24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. They also developed albuminuria and
hyperlipidemia shortly after weaning. Plasma lipid profiles revealed
that all lipoprotein fractions were elevated. Transgenic rats showed
atherosclerotic lesions in the aorta, which progressed with high-fat and
high-cholesterol feeding.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HYPERCALCEMIA, INFANTILE
CYP24A1, 2-BP DEL, 1425TC

In an infant girl born of consanguineous Turkish parents, who developed
infantile hypercalcemia (143880) while receiving a 500 IU daily dose of
vitamin D, Schlingmann et al. (2011) identified homozygosity for a 2-bp
deletion (1425delTC) in the CYP24A1 gene, resulting in a frameshift and
predicted to cause premature termination of the protein. The mutation
was not found in at least 204 control alleles, and transfection studies
demonstrated complete loss of CYP24A1 catabolic activity with the mutant
compared to wildtype.

.0002
HYPERCALCEMIA, INFANTILE
CYP24A1, 3-BP DEL, 427GAA

In monozygotic twin brothers from a German family, who developed
infantile hypercalcemia (143880) while receiving a 500 IU daily dose of
vitamin D, Schlingmann et al. (2011) identified compound heterozygosity
for a 3-bp deletion (427delGAA) in the CYP24A1 gene, resulting in the
in-frame deletion of a glutamic acid residue at codon 143 (E143del), and
a 451G-T transversion, resulting in a gln151-to-ter (E151X; 126065.0003)
substitution. In a Turkish infant who also developed hypercalcemia on
500 IU per day of vitamin D, Schlingmann et al. (2011) identified
compound heterozygosity for the 3-bp deletion and a 476G-A transition in
the CYP24A1 gene, resulting in an arg159-to-gln (R159Q; 126065.0004)
substitution. The mutations were not found in at least 204 control
alleles, and transfection studies demonstrated ablation of CYP24A1
catabolic activity with either the 3-bp deletion or the R159Q mutation
compared to wildtype.

In a 47-year-old man who had an episode of nephrolithiasis at 19 years
of age and was subsequently asymptomatic until hypercalcemia was
discovered on routine testing at 39 years of age (see 143880), Streeten
et al. (2011) identified homozygosity for the E143del mutation in
CYP24A1. The patient had a suppressed parathyroid hormone level,
elevated levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, and
low levels of 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. His adult son with
normocalciuria was heterozygous for the E143del mutation.

In molecular-modeling simulations, Ji and Shen (2011) found that the
R159Q mutation changes interactions between the heme molecule and
24-hydroxylase, due to destruction of hydrogen bonds between the heme
propionate group and arginine.

.0005
HYPERCALCEMIA, INFANTILE
CYP24A1, ARG396TRP (dbSNP rs114368325)

In a German patient who developed infantile hypercalcemia (143880)
following a 600,000 IU oral dose of vitamin D, Schlingmann et al. (2011)
identified homozygosity for a 1186C-T transition in the CYP24A1 gene,
resulting in an arg396-to-trp (R396W) substitution. In 2 Russian
brothers who developed infantile hypercalcemia while taking 500 IU of
vitamin D per day, the R396W mutation was found in compound
heterozygosity with a 1226T-C transition in the CYP24A1 gene, resulting
in a leu409-to-ser (L409S; 126065.0006) substitution; and in 2 unrelated
patients from Germany who developed hypercalcemia of infancy after 2 and
3 oral boluses of 600,000 IU of vitamin D, respectively, previously
reported by Misselwitz and Hesse (1986), Schlingmann et al. (2011)
identified compound heterozygosity for the R396W mutation and a 964G-A
transition in CYP24A1, resulting in a glu322-to-lys (E322K; 126065.0007)
substitution. The E322K mutation was not found in at least 204 control
alleles; the R396W and L409S mutations, which had previously been
annotated as putative polymorphisms in the dbSNP database, were tested
in a sample of 1,024 control alleles, and L409S was not detected, but
R396W was identified in 4 of the control alleles. Transfection studies
demonstrated that R396W and E322K mutations resulted in complete loss of
CYP24A1 catabolic activity, whereas the L409S mutation retained small
but measurable levels of activity.

In molecular-modeling simulations, Ji and Shen (2011) found that the
R396W mutation changes interactions between the heme molecule and
24-hydroxylase, due to destruction of hydrogen bonds between the heme
propionate group and arginine.

HYPERCALCEMIA, INFANTILE
CYP24A1, LEU409SER (dbSNP rs6068812)

See 126065.0005 and Schlingmann et al. (2011).

In molecular-modeling simulations, Ji and Shen (2011) found that the
L409S mutation weakens the binding of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 to
24-hydroxylase.

.0007
HYPERCALCEMIA, INFANTILE
CYP24A1, GLU322LYS

See 126065.0005 and Schlingmann et al. (2011).

In molecular-modeling simulations, Ji and Shen (2011) found that the
E322K mutation changes interactions between the heme molecule and
24-hydroxylase. Schlingmann et al. (2011) stated that the E322K mutation
abolishes important hydrogen bonding between the I-helix and the
B-prime/C loop backbone, affecting their relative orientation and that
of the B-prime helix and thereby preventing correct protein folding and
stability.

615417	TITLE *615417 BET1-LIKE PROTEIN; BET1L
;;GOLGI SNARE, 15-KD; GS15
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

BET1L is part of a SNARE (SNAP receptor) complex that recruits soluble
N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF; 601633) attachment proteins
(SNAPs) to membranes. BET1L is a vesicle-associated SNARE (v-SNARE) that
pairs with a target membrane SNARE (t-SNARE), such as GOS28 (GOSR1;
604026) and syntaxin-5 (STX5; 603189) (Xu et al., 1997; Volchuk et al.,
2004).

CLONING

By searching databases using rat Bet1 (605456) as probe, followed by
screening a rat brain cDNA library, Xu et al. (1997) cloned rat Bet1l,
which they called Gs15. The deduced 111-amino acid protein has a
C-terminal hydrophobic region that may function as a membrane anchor.
Northern blot analysis revealed ubiquitous expression in rat tissues.
Immunoblot analysis and immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated
expression of a 15-kD protein on Golgi membranes.

GENE FUNCTION

Xu et al. (1997) showed that rat Gs15 bound to recombinant SNAP. They
concluded that GS15 is a C-terminal tail-anchored integral membrane
v-SNARE associated with the Golgi apparatus.

Using immunoelectron microscopy with mammalian cell lines and tissues,
Xu et al. (2002) showed that Gs15 was primarily found in the medial
cisternae of the Golgi apparatus and adjacent tubulovesicular elements.
Coimmunoprecipitation analysis identified rat Gs15 as part of a distinct
SNARE complex containing 3 other SNAREs, Stx5, Gs28, and Ykt6 (606209),
implicated in both ER-to-Golgi and intra-Golgi transport. Inhibition of
GS15 expression by small interfering RNA in HeLa cells resulted in
redistribution of Golgi markers into small dotty and diffuse labeling.
Xu et al. (2002) proposed that GS15 has an essential role in the Golgi
apparatus.

Using quantitative immunogold labeling in mammalian cells, Volchuk et
al. (2004) showed that the distribution of t-SNAREs was nearly even
across the Golgi stack from the cis to the trans side, whereas Gs15 was
present in a gradient of increasing concentration toward the trans face
of the stack. In contrast, the v- and t-SNARE subunits of a second
distinct SNARE complex required for intra-Golgi transport decreased in
concentration toward the trans face. Volchuk et al. (2004) proposed that
transport within the stack uses countercurrent gradients of 2 Golgi
SNAREpins (i.e., complexes of cognate v- and t-SNAREs bridging 2
membranes) and may involve a homotypic fusion mechanism.

MAPPING

Gross (2013) mapped the BET1L gene to chromosome 11p15.5 based on an
alignment of the BET1L sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF234160) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

142640	TITLE *142640 HISTIDINE-RICH GLYCOPROTEIN; HRG
;;HRGP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Koide et al. (1986) cloned HRG from a human liver cDNA library. The
deduced HRG protein contains a leader sequence of 18 amino acids and a
mature protein of 507 amino acids. It is histidine and proline rich and
has a molecular mass of 75 kD. More than half of the protein sequence
consists of 5 different types of internal repeats. Within the last 3
internal repeats (type V), there are 12 tandem repetitions of a 5-amino
acid segment with a consensus sequence of GHHPH. This 'histidine-rich
region' in the C terminus shows a high degree of similarity to the
histidine-rich region of high molecular weight kininogen (HMWK; see
612358); the N terminus shares sequence similarity with antithrombin III
(AT3; 107300).

GENE FUNCTION

Koide et al. (1986) noted that HRG interacts with heparin, the
lysine-binding site of plasminogen (173350), and thrombospondin (see
188060).

Shatsky et al. (1989) found that HRGP could inhibit or delay T-cell
proliferation and cytokine release by interfering with early T-cell
activation events. They proposed that HRGP may function as a natural
suppressive regulator of T-lymphocyte activation.

Hutchens et al. (1992) noted that HRG has high capacity to bind Zn(2+)
and Cu(2+), both of which are highly bioavailable in human milk. Using
dot blot and SDS-PAGE immunoblot analyses, they found that HRG was
present in both human colostrum and milk. Immuno- and Zn-affinity
isolation and N-terminal sequence analysis confirmed the identity of the
protein.

Leung (1993) characterized HRG as an abundant plasma protein and noted
that several biologic properties of the protein had been identified.
Properties that are relevant to the hemostatic mechanism are its binding
to plasminogen and to heparin. By binding to plasminogen, HRG reduces
the amount of plasminogen in the circulating blood that is available for
activation into plasmin and thus acts as an inhibitor of fibrinolysis.
By binding to heparin, HRG reduces the amount of heparin and through
this mechanism reduces the inhibition of coagulation by the
heparin-antithrombin III complex. Since both effects, the inhibition of
fibrinolysis and the reduction of inhibition of coagulation, work in the
same direction, an excess of HRG might be expected to have a
prothrombotic effect.

Using fluorescence and electron microscopy, Rydengard et al. (2007)
showed that HRGP exerted pH- and zinc-dependent activity against
gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. This activity required the
heparin-binding and histidine-rich domains of HRGP and was blocked in
the presence of heparin. A peptide consisting of the 4 consecutive GHHPH
motifs in HRGP was antibacterial.

Using ELISA, immunoblot analysis, bioassays, and confocal microscopy,
Manderson et al. (2009) showed that HRG bound strongly to, but neither
activated nor inhibited, several complement proteins and that complexes
existed in human serum and in synovial fluid of rheumatoid arthritis
(RA; see 180300) patients. HRG enhanced complement activation on
necrotic cells. Immune complexes formed in the presence of HRG showed
enhanced complement activation, while those formed in the presence of
C1q (120550) had diminished activation. Manderson et al. (2009) proposed
that HRG may assist in the maintenance of normal immune function by
mediating clearance of necrotic material and inhibiting formation of
insoluble immune complexes, allowing for better complement activation
and complex clearance.

MAPPING

Using a cDNA for HRG isolated by Koide et al. (1986) to screen a panel
of rodent-human somatic cell hybrids, Oldenburg et al. (1989) mapped the
HRG locus to chromosome 3. Van den Berg et al. (1990) showed that the
HRG gene could be excluded from 3pter-p14. By in situ hybridization,
Hennis et al. (1994) localized the HRG gene to the terminal region of
3q28-q29. They also identified a CA-repeat polymorphism in intron G and
used it in linkage analysis in the CEPH families to confirm the
localization to the most distal band of 3q. The availability of a
PCR-based genetic polymorphism of HRG should be useful for study of the
pathophysiologic role of HRG in families with thrombosis.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a 43-year-old woman with HRG deficiency who suffered from right
transverse sinus thrombosis (THPH11; 613116) during oral contraceptive
treatment, Shigekiyo et al. (1998) identified a 429G-A transition in
exon 3 of the HRG gene, which caused a gly85-to-glu substitution
(142640.0001) in the first cystatin-like domain of the protein. The
mutation was found in members of her family with HRG deficiency but not
in 50 unrelated healthy Japanese individuals.

- Association with Decreased Activated Partial Thromboplastin
Time

Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is considered a global test
of thrombotic tendency. A shortened aPTT is associated with an increased
risk of thrombosis as well as several prothrombotic risk factors
including age, female sex, estrogen use, and obesity. Prolonged aPTT is
an indicator of coagulation disorders in patients with deficiencies of
factors in the intrinsic pathways of coagulation. Houlihan et al. (2010)
conducted a genomewide association study for activated partial
thromboplastin time (aPTT) in a total of 1,477 relatively healthy adults
from the Lothian Birth Cohorts of 1936 (LBC1936) and 1921 (LBC1921). A
highly significant association with a relatively large effect size was
found between aPTT and a SNP in the HRG gene, dbSNP rs9898 (combined p =
1.34 x 10(-11)). The SNP dbSNP rs9898 represents a missense change,
pro204 to ser (P204S, 610C-T), in exon 5 of HRG gene. The effects of
dbSNP rs9898 were additive, with each T allele decreasing aPTT by 0.26
standard deviations. This SNP explained 1.8% and 0.77% of the variance
in aPTT in LBC1936 and LBC1921, respectively. HRG can inhibit rosette
formation (Shatsky et al., 1989) and interacts with heparin,
thrombospondin (188060), and plasminogen (173350) (Koide et al., 1986).
Mutations in HRG cause thrombophilia.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
THROMBOPHILIA DUE TO HISTIDINE-RICH GLYCOPROTEIN DEFICIENCY
HRG, GLY85GLU

In a 43-year-old Japanese proband with HRG deficiency who had a right
transverse sinus thrombosis (613116) while taking contraceptive
medication, Shigekiyo et al. (1998) identified heterozygosity for a
429G-A transition in exon 3 of the HRG gene, which caused a gly85-to-glu
substitution in the first cystatin-like domain of the protein. The
authors designated the variant HRG-Tokushima. HRG-Tokushima was found in
other family members with HRG deficiency but not in 50 unrelated
Japanese control individuals. To elucidate the identified mutation as
the cause of the secretion defect of HRG in the proband's plasma, they
constructed and transiently expressed the recombinant mutant in baby
hamster kidney (BHK) cells. They found that only about 20% of the
Tokushima-type HRG was secreted into the culture medium, and
intracellular degradation of the mutant was observed.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Acylphosphatase (EC 3.6.1.7) is a hydrolase that specifically catalyzes
the hydrolysis of the carboxyl-phosphate bond of acyl phosphates. It is
a small (relative molecular mass about 11 kD) and stable enzyme that is
distributed among a wide variety of species and tissues. The enzyme has
been purified from skeletal muscle of various mammals and birds and the
primary structures determined. The primary structure is well conserved
among different species (summary by Modesti et al., 1993). Also see
erythrocyte acylphosphatase (ACYP1; 600875).

CLONING

Modesti et al. (1993) constructed a DNA sequence coding for human muscle
acylphosphatase and studied its expression in E. coli and S. cerevisiae.

DESCRIPTION Thymidylate kinase (EC 2.7.4.9; ATP:dTMP phosphotransferase) catalyzes
the phosphorylation of dTMP to form dTDP in the dTTP synthesis pathway
for DNA synthesis. Knowledge of the essential function of dTMP kinase in
eukaryotes comes from the study of a cell cycle mutant, cdc8, in
Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The product of the cdc8 gene is involved in
the elongation step of S phase in cell cycle progression. Huang et al.
(1994) cloned the human thymidylate kinase gene by complementation with
the cdc8 mutation. The cDNA sequence revealed an open reading frame that
encodes a protein with a molecular weight of 23,806. Structural and
functional analyses suggested that the cDNA codes for authentic human
dTMP kinase. The mRNA levels and enzyme activities corresponded to cell
cycle progression and cell growth stages.

612842	TITLE *612842 RASD FAMILY, MEMBER 2; RASD2
;;RAS HOMOLOG ENRICHED IN STRIATUM; RHES;;
TUMOR ENDOTHELIAL MARKER 2; TEM2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE), St. Croix et al. (2000)
identified partial cDNAs corresponding to several tumor endothelial
markers (TEMs) that displayed elevated expression during tumor
angiogenesis. Among the genes they identified was TEM2.

Vargiu et al. (2004) determined that RHES, which contains 266 amino
acids in rat and human, is a putative Ras (HRAS; 190020)-like monomeric
G protein with an extended C-terminal domain compared with other Ras
family proteins. It terminates in a conserved CAAX box (CTIQ in human)
for targeting to the plasma membrane. RHES shares highest similarity
with DEXRAS (RASD1; 605550). Northern blot analysis of several rat
tissues detected high Rhes expression in brain, much lower expression in
thyroid gland, and little to no expression in other tissues. In situ
hybridization revealed prominent expression in striatum, in specific
regions of the cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, and thalamus, and in
several brain nuclei. Fluorescence-tagged rat Rhes localized to the
plasma membrane, which required farnesylation of the C-terminal CAAX
box.

Using Northern blot analysis, Spano et al. (2004) found that expression
of mouse Rhes was high in brain, low in kidney, thyroid, lung, heart,
and testis, and absent in liver. RT-PCR detected Rhes expression
beginning at mouse embryonic day 13.5.

GENE FUNCTION

The imidazoline compound efaroxan potentiates nutrient-induced insulin
secretion from pancreatic beta cells. Chan et al. (2002) showed that
efaroxan upregulated RHES expression in rat and human pancreatic beta
cells.

Vargiu et al. (2004) found that about 30% of endogenous Rhes was bound
to GTP in rat PC12 cells, and that the proportion bound to GTP was not
affected by typical Ras family nucleotide exchange factors (e.g., SOS1;
182530). Rhes activated PI3 kinase (see 601232). In contrast, Rhes
impaired activation of the cAMP/protein kinase A (see 601639) pathway by
TSH (see TSHB; 188540) and by a constitutively active beta-2 adrenergic
receptor (ADRB2; 109690) mutant by a mechanism that suggested uncoupling
of the receptor to its cognate heterotrimeric G protein (see GNAS;
139320).

Agretti et al. (2007) showed that RHES inhibited basal and bovine
TSH-stimulated cAMP production in COS-7 cells coexpressing RHES with TSH
receptor (TSHR; 603372). This inhibition was due to reduced expression
of TSHR at the cell surface. RHES also attenuated cAMP accumulation via
ligand-induced activation of coexpressed FSH receptor (FSHR; 136435) and
LH receptor (LHCGR; 152790).

MAPPING

Hartz (2009) mapped the RASD2 gene to chromosome 22q12.3 based on an
alignment of the RASD2 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF279143) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.1).

ANIMAL MODEL

Spano et al. (2004) found that Rhes -/- mice were viable and appeared to
develop normally, but they weighed less than wildtype mice and displayed
minor behavioral abnormalities. Rhes -/- mice showed altered locomotor
activity in an open-field test and performed worse than wildtype mice in
the rota-rod test. Female Rhes -/- mice appeared more anxious than
wildtype females.

602750	TITLE *602750 D-DOPACHROME TAUTOMERASE; DDT
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

D-dopachrome tautomerase (DDT) converts D-dopachrome into
5,6-dihydroxyindole (summary by Nishihira et al., 1998).

CLONING

By screening a liver library with a rat D-dopachrome tautomerase cDNA,
Nishihira et al. (1998) identified cDNAs encoding human DDT. The
sequence of the predicted 118-amino acid DDT protein is 80% identical to
that of the rat protein. The molecular mass of recombinant DDT expressed
in bacterial cells was 13 kD by SDS-PAGE. Northern blot analysis
revealed that DDT was expressed as a 0.6-kb mRNA in all tissues tested,
with the strongest expression in liver.

GENE FUNCTION

Using site-directed mutagenesis, Nishihira et al. (1998) showed that the
N-terminal proline is essential for D-dopachrome tautomerization.

GENE STRUCTURE

Esumi et al. (1998) found that the DDT gene in human and mouse is
identical in exon structure to the MIF gene (153620). Both genes have 2
introns that are located at equivalent positions relative to a 2-fold
repeat in protein structure. Although in similar positions, the introns
are in different phases relative to the open reading frame. Other
members of this superfamily exist in nematodes and a plant, and a
related gene in C. elegans shares an intron position with MIF and DDT.

MAPPING

In addition to similarities in structure, the genes for DDT and MIF are
closely linked on human chromosome 22 and mouse chromosome 10. Esumi et
al. (1998) demonstrated the close linkage by anaphase fluorescence in
situ hybridization in the human. The DDT gene was mapped in the mouse by
interspecific backcross analysis.

612282	TITLE *612282 ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 804A; ZNF804A
;;CHROMOSOME 2 OPEN READING FRAME 10; C2ORF10
DESCRIPTION 
GENE FUNCTION

Using a yeast 2-hybrid system to screen cDNA expression libraries,
including an adult brain cDNA library, Lim et al. (2006) showed that
C2ORF10 bound N-terminal sequences of ataxin-1 (ATXN1; 601556)
containing either 30 or 82 glutamine repeats.

MAPPING

Hartz (2008) mapped the ZNF804A gene to chromosome 2q32.1 based on an
alignment of the ZNF804A sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF052145) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.1).

603392	TITLE *603392 BCL2-INTERACTING KILLER; BIK
;;NBK
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The product of the BIK gene interacts with BCL2 (151430) and BCLXL
(600039) and promotes cell death (summary by Chittenden et al., 1995).

CLONING

The BCL2 protooncogene has been shown to enhance the survival of a
variety of cell types exposed to diverse cell death-inducing stimuli.
Members of the BCL2-related protein family contain 2 conserved domains,
BH1 and BH2. BCL2-related proteins either promote cell survival or
accelerate cell death. Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen with BCL2 as bait,
Boyd et al. (1995) isolated a human B-cell cDNA encoding BIK
(BCL2-interacting killer). Additional 2-hybrid assays along with in
vitro and in vivo binding studies demonstrated that BIK interacts with
the cellular survival-promoting proteins BCL2 and BCLXL as well as with
the viral survival-promoting proteins Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) BHRF1 and
adenovirus E1B 19-kD. In transient transfection assays, BIK promoted
cell death in a manner similar to the BCL2-related death-promoting
proteins BAX (600040) and BAK (600516). This death-promoting activity of
BIK was suppressed by coexpression of BCL2, BCLXL, EBV BHRF1, and E1B
19-kD, suggesting that BIK may be a common target for antiapoptotic
proteins. The predicted 160-amino acid BIK protein contains a C-terminal
hydrophobic domain, a characteristic shared by BCL2 family members.
Sequence analysis revealed that BIK lacked the BH1 and BH2 domains, but
did share a 9-amino acid domain (designated BH3) with BAX and BAK, which
Boyd et al. (1995) suggested was a critical determinant for the
death-promoting activity of these proteins.

GENE FUNCTION

Independently, Chittenden et al. (1995) identified the BH3 domain and
found that this domain is critical for the cell killing and BCLXL
binding activities of BAX, BIK, and BAK. By immunofluorescence, Han et
al. (1996) found that BIK, which they called NBK, colocalized with E1B
19-kD at the nuclear envelope and cytoplasmic membranes. BIK expression
functionally antagonized E1B 19kD-mediated inhibition of apoptotic cell
death and completely prevented transformation by E1A and E1B 19-kD.

Verma et al. (2000) used Northern blot analysis to reveal ubiquitous
expression of a 1.3-kb transcript with highest levels in heart and
skeletal muscle.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Verma et al. (2000) determined that the
BIK gene contains 5 exons and spans approximately 19 kb. Sequence and
mutation analysis indicated a lack of TATA and CCAAT boxes and localized
the minimal promoter region to nucleotides -211 to +153.

MAPPING

Using FISH, Verma et al. (2000) mapped the BIK gene to chromosome
22q13.3.
