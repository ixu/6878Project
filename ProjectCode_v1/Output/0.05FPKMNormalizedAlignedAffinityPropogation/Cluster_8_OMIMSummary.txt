;;NPH2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Mammalian neurexophilin was discovered as a 29-kD neuronal glycoprotein
that copurifies in a tight complex with neurexin I-alpha (600565)
(Petrenko et al., 1996). By searching sequence databases using the amino
acid sequence of mammalian neurexophilin as the query, Missler and
Sudhof (1998) identified human ESTs corresponding to neurexophilins-1
(NXPH1; 604639), -2 (NXPH2), -3 (NXPH3; 604636), and -4 (NXPH4; 604637).
Comparison of the amino acid sequences of human, rat, mouse, and bovine
neurexophilins revealed that neurexophilins share a common predicted
structure composed of 5 domains: an N-terminal signal peptide, a
variable N-terminal domain, a highly conserved central domain that is
N-glycosylated, a short linker region, and a conserved C-terminal domain
that is cysteine-rich. Northern blot analysis of a variety of human
tissues detected NXPH2 expression in brain and kidney. Missler and
Sudhof (1998) concluded that neurexophilins form a family of related
glycoproteins that are proteolytically processed after synthesis. They
suggested that neurexophilins are signaling molecules that resemble
neuropeptides and that act by binding to alpha-neurexins and possibly
other receptors.

609000	TITLE *609000 MONOOXYGENASE, DBH-LIKE, 1; MOXD1
;;MONOOXYGENASE X; MOX
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By differential display of genes showing altered expression during
senescence in human diploid fibroblasts, Chambers et al. (1998) cloned
MOXD1, which they called MOX. The 3-prime UTR contains multiple
consensus polyadenylation signals. The deduced 545-amino acid protein
has several cysteine residues likely to be involved in disulfide bond
formation. It also has a subset of cysteines within the catalytic core
that are conserved with DBH (223360) and PAM (170270), as well as other
conserved residues that are likely to coordinate copper and contribute
to enzymatic activity. The catalytic core regions of MOX and DBH share
about 40% amino acid identity. Northern blot analysis detected a MOX
transcript of about 3.3 kb in fibroblasts, and Northern blot analysis of
several tissues showed highest expression in lung, kidney, and brain.
RT-PCR analysis and RNA dot blot analysis confirmed highest expression
in kidney and lung, and MOX was also expressed in testis, fetal kidney,
uterus, and adrenal gland. Western blot analysis detected endogenous MOX
at an apparent molecular mass of 62.6 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

Chambers et al. (1998) found that most primary fibroblast or umbilical
vein endothelial cell cultures upregulated MOX expression during
replicative senescence.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Chambers et al. (1998) mapped the MOX gene
to chromosome 6q.

;;EME1, S. POMBE, HOMOLOG OF, 1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

EME1 and MUS81 (606591) form an endonuclease complex that cleaves
branched DNA structures, especially those arising during stalled DNA
replication (Abraham et al., 2003).

CLONING

By searching for homologs of S. pombe Eme1, followed by PCR, Ciccia et
al. (2003) cloned EME1 and EME2 (610886). The deduced 583-amino acid
EME1 protein has a calculated molecular mass of 65 kD and shares 44%
identity with EME2.

Abraham et al. (2003) cloned mouse Eme1, which encodes a 570-amino acid
protein that shares 66% identity with human EME1. Northern blot analysis
detected expression of Eme1 in all embryonic and adult mouse tissues
examined.

GENE FUNCTION

Ciccia et al. (2003) showed that recombinant EME1 interacted with
recombinant MUS81. The heterodimer had DNA endonuclease activity against
3-prime flap and replication fork substrates, but the activity was much
lower against splayed arm or Holliday junction substrates. Neither EME1
nor MUS81 alone showed nuclease activity.

Abraham et al. (2003) found that the mouse Eme1/Mus81 heterodimer
preferentially cleaved 3-prime flap structures and replication forks
rather than Holliday junctions in vitro. Eme1 -/- mouse embryonic stem
cells exhibited no changes in viability, growth rate, or activation of
DNA damage-activated cell cycle checkpoints. However, loss of Eme1 led
to increased aneuploidy, increased sister chromatid exchange upon DNA
damage, and increased levels of spontaneous chromosomal abnormalities,
including breaks, fragments, chromosomal fusions, and dicentric
chromosomes. Compared with wildtype cells, Eme1 -/- cells showed a
2-fold increase in chromosomal abnormalities following treatment with
the DNA-crosslinking agent mitomycin C. Abraham et al. (2003) concluded
that EME1 plays a key role in DNA repair and maintenance of genome
integrity.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Ciccia et al. (2003) mapped the EME1 gene
to chromosome 17q21.3. Abraham et al. (2003) mapped the mouse Eme1 gene
to chromosome 11C.
