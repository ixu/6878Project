CLONING

Kao et al. (1994) cloned cDNAs encoding NF45 and NF90. The NF90 gene
encodes a 671-amino acid polypeptide with limited similarity to several
RNA-binding proteins. The NF90 gene also appears to encode an
alternatively spliced 404-amino acid polypeptide, of which the first 394
amino acids are identical to the longer clone. Northern and Western blot
analysis demonstrated NF45 and NF90 expression in several cell types,
including both unstimulated and stimulated Jurkat T cells.

By immunoscreening a HeLa cell cDNA library for phosphoproteins,
Matsumoto-Taniura et al. (1996) isolated a partial cDNA encoding ILF3,
which they termed MPP4. Immunoprecipitation analysis indicated that MPP4
encodes 90- and 110-kD proteins. Immunofluorescence microscopy
demonstrated cytoplasmic expression during M phase and nuclear/nucleolar
expression during interphase.

Patel et al. (1999) purified double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-binding
proteins from HeLa cell extracts and microsequenced a 90-kD protein with
identity to MPP4 in its N terminus. Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen with a
mutant RNA-activated protein kinase (PRKR; 176871) as bait, followed by
RT-PCR, they isolated a full-length cDNA encoding ILF3, which they
called DRBP76. Sequence analysis predicted that the 702-amino acid
protein has a bipartite nuclear localization signal, 2 dsRNA-binding
domains, an RG2 domain, and multiple potential phosphorylation sites.
SDS-PAGE analysis showed expression of a 90-kD protein, larger than the
calculated 76 kD. EMSA analysis confirmed the dsRNA binding activity of
DRBP76. Autoradiographic analysis indicated that DRBP76 is
phosphorylated by PRKR.

Langland et al. (1999) noted that NF90 is primarily localized to
ribosomes.

Saunders et al. (2001) obtained a cDNA encoding DRBP76, which they
termed NFAR1, as well as a variant cDNA encoding a 110-kD, 894-amino
acid protein they designated NFAR2. Sequence analysis showed that the
NFAR proteins share homology with a known PRKR substrate, the
translation initiation factor EIF2S1 (603907). Northern blot analysis
revealed ubiquitous expression of multiple transcripts ranging from 4.0
to 8.0 kb. Immunoblot analysis indicated variable expression with lower
amounts particularly notable in liver and spleen, suggesting
differential regulation at the translational or posttranslational level.
Immunoblot analysis and confocal microscopy demonstrated that PRKR and
both NFAR variants reciprocally coimmunoprecipitate and colocalize in
the nucleus. Immunoprecipitation analysis indicated an association with
spliceosomes.

Viranaicken et al. (2006) identified splice variants of human and mouse
ILF3 that encode long and short isoforms of the ILF3 and NF90 proteins
via inclusion or exclusion of 13 N-terminal residues, respectively.

GENE FUNCTION

Kao et al. (1994) showed that the NF45 and NF90 proteins form an NFAT
DNA-binding activity that is enhanced by T-cell stimulation and
inhibited by cyclosporin A and FK506.

Functional analysis by Saunders et al. (2001) indicated that both NFAR
proteins regulate gene transcription, probably at the level of mRNA
elongation. NFAR2 exhibited potent, constitutive regulatory activity
through its unique C-terminal region, which specifically interacted with
FUS (137070) and SMN1 (600354). Saunders et al. (2001) concluded that
NFARs facilitate dsRNA-regulated gene expression at the level of
posttranscription.

Shim et al. (2002) showed that NF90 binds to a subregion of the 3-prime
untranslated region that contains several AU-rich elements (AREs) and
slows down the degradation of IL2 (147680) mRNA. In nonstimulated cells,
NF90 was mostly nuclear, but T-cell activation resulted in its
accumulation in the cytoplasm. The authors concluded that nuclear export
of NF90 is required for IL2 mRNA stabilization.

Pfeifer et al. (2008) found that NFAR1 and NFAR2 were involved in
retaining cellular transcripts in intranuclear foci and could regulate
mRNA export to the cytoplasm. They also remained associated with
exported ribonucleoprotein complexes. Treatment of HeLa cells with small
interfering RNA to NFAR1 and/or NFAR2 resulted in an increase in protein
synthesis rates, particularly in the presence the mRNA export factors
TAP (NXF1; 602647), p15 (NXT1; 605811), or RAE1 (603343). Depletion of
NFAR in mouse fibroblasts or HeLa cells dramatically increased their
susceptibility to vesicular stomatitis virus or influenza virus,
respectively. Pfeifer et al. (2008) concluded that NFAR1 and NFAR2 are
retained on polyribosomes and act to govern translation rates, and that
they also play a role in innate immune defense to virus infection.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Saunders et al. (2001) determined that the
NFAR gene contains 21 exons and spans 16.2 kb. The 90-kD NFAR1 variant
expresses exon 18, which contains several stop codons that lead to
termination at amino acid 702. The 110-kD NFAR2 variant lacks exon 18
but contains exons 19, 20, and 21.

Viranaicken et al. (2006) identified an additional alternatively spliced
exon within intron 2 of the mouse and human ILF3 genes, increasing the
total number of exons to 22.

MAPPING

Saunders et al. (2001) mapped the NFAR gene to chromosome 19p13 by FISH.

ANIMAL MODEL

Pfeifer et al. (2008) found that mice lacking Nfar died in utero.

603436	TITLE *603436 ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 205; ZNF205
;;ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 210; ZNF210
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The largest family of zinc finger proteins is the C2H2, or Kruppel,
type. See 165220. Some members of the Kruppel family contain a conserved
KRAB region that can be divided into 2 subregions, the A box and the B
box. See 601742. While constructing a transcript map of the critical
region of familial Mediterranean fever (see MEFV; 608107), Deng et al.
(1998) isolated cDNAs encoding ZNF205, which they designated ZNF210.
Sequence analysis indicated that the predicted 504-amino acid protein is
a Kruppel-type zinc finger protein that contains a KRAB A box N-terminal
to 8 zinc finger motifs. Northern blot analysis revealed that the 2.2-kb
ZNF210 mRNA was expressed in all tissues tested. An additional
transcript was detected in a number of tissues.

MAPPING

By analysis of clones from the MEFV region, Deng et al. (1998)
determined that the ZNF205 gene is located approximately 120 kb from the
MEFV gene on 16p13.3. They reported that 4 other zinc finger genes are
located in the MEFV region, including ZNF200 (603231), ZNF174, and
FPM315.

605475	TITLE *605475 BAI1-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 2; BAIAP2
;;INSULIN RECEPTOR SUBSTRATE p53; IRSP53
DESCRIPTION Brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor-1 (BAI1; 602682) is a secretin
receptor family member whose expression is induced by p53 (191170). Yeh
et al. (1996) cloned a hamster cDNA encoding a 53-kD BAI-associated
protein which, when expressed in mammalian cells, is tyrosine
phosphorylated by the insulin receptor. They termed the protein IRSp53
for insulin receptor substrate p53. The protein contains 521 amino acids
with a calculated molecular mass of 57 kD and is highly expressed in the
brain. The protein appears to be localized primarily in the particulate
fraction of cell lysates. The IRSp53 cDNA was found to encode an
additional protein product of 58 kD (p58) in vivo.

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen with cytoplasmic BAI1 as bait, followed by
screening of a human fetal brain cDNA library, Oda et al. (1999)
isolated a cDNA encoding BAIAP2 and a splice variant. Sequence analysis
predicted that the 520- and 521-amino acid proteins are homologous to
hamster IRSp53 with identity conserved in the C-terminal SH3 domain.
Northern blot analysis revealed expression of a 3.2-kb transcript
primarily in brain with very low levels in placenta, prostate, and
testis as well as ubiquitous expression of a 2.2-kb transcript that is
relatively abundant in liver, prostate, testis, and placenta. The
expression of the 3.2-kb transcript overlaps that of BAI1 in brain
subregions, is similar to that of neuron- and neuroendocrine-restricted
NSE (ENO2; 131360), but different from that of astrocyte-specific GFAP
(137780). Yeast 2-hybrid and GST pull-down analyses with mutated
proteins confirmed that the SH3 domain of BAIAP2 interacts with the
proline-rich cytoplasmic portion of BAI1. Double immunofluorescence
microscopy demonstrated colocalization of BAI1 and BAIAP2 in the
cytoplasmic membrane, whereas cells expressing BAIAP2 alone showed
diffuse staining of the cytosol and nucleus.

Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA; 125370) is an autosomal
dominant, progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by
selective neuron death in the dentatorubral and pallidoluysian pathways
and is associated with CAG repeats in the DRPLA gene (607462). Using a
yeast 2-hybrid screen of a human fetal brain cDNA library with
N-terminus-deleted DRPLA as bait, Okamura-Oho et al. (1999) identified
cDNAs encoding human IRSP53. Sequence analysis identified deduced
proteins of 552 and 521 amino acids. The latter sequence is 94%
identical to hamster IRSp53. Northern blot analysis revealed expression
of a 3.0-kb transcript in most tissues examined and a 3.8-kb transcript
mainly in brain, suggesting alternative splicing. After stimulation of
cells with insulin, immunoblot analysis detected a phosphorylated 58-kD
IRSP53 protein which did not enhance binding to DRPLA.
Coimmunoprecipitation analysis and reporter gene assays indicated that
DRPLA and IRSP53 do interact. Confocal microscopy demonstrated
colocalization in perinuclear dots. GST pull-down analysis determined
that the SH3 domain in the C terminus of IRSP53 binds to a proline-rich
region of DRPLA, which may be interfered with by extended polyglutamine
tracts in the form of CAG repeats.

Miki et al. (2000) demonstrated that IRSP53 is the critical linker
between RAC (see 602048) and WAVE2 (605875). Activated RAC binds to the
N terminus of IRSP53, and the C-terminal SH3 domain of IRSP53 binds to
WAVE2 to form a trimolecular complex. From studies of ectopic
expression, Miki et al. (2000) found that IRSP53 is essential for RAC to
induce membrane ruffling, probably because it recruits WAVE2, which
stimulates actin polymerization mediated by the ARP2/3 complex.

By FISH, Oda et al. (1999) mapped the BAIAP2 gene to chromosome 17q25.

608918	TITLE *608918 ATP SYNTHASE, MITOCHONDRIAL F1 COMPLEX, ASSEMBLY FACTOR 2; ATPAF2
;;ATP12, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; ATP12
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Mitochondrial ATPase is a multisubunit enzyme that catalyzes ATP
synthesis during oxidative phosphorylation. It consists of a globular,
membrane-extrinsic F1 catalytic part, and an H(+)-translocating,
membrane-spanning Fo part.

In yeast, Atp12 is required for the proper assembly of the F1 component
of the mitochondrial ATP synthase complex. By searching an EST database
for sequences similar to yeast Atp12, followed by PCR and 5-prime RACE
of a human fetal liver cDNA library, Wang et al. (2001) cloned ATPAF2.
The deduced 289-amino acid protein contains an N-terminal mitochondrial
targeting sequence. EST database analysis and SAGE data indicated that
ATPAF2 is widely expressed at moderate abundance.

GENE FUNCTION

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Wang et al. (2001) found that ATPAF2
interacted strongly with the ATP synthase F1 alpha subunit (ATP5A1;
164360) and weakly with the F1 beta subunit (ATP5B; 102910). ATPAF2 also
partially rescued an Atp12-deficient yeast strain.

GENE STRUCTURE

Wang et al. (2001) determined that the mouse Atpaf2 gene contains at
least 8 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Wang et al. (2001) mapped the ATPAF2 gene
to chromosome 17p11.2. They mapped the mouse Atpaf2 gene to a region of
chromosome 11 that shows homology of synteny to human chromosome
17p11.2.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In an infant with decreased complex V activity (MC5DN1; 604273), De
Meirleir et al. (2004) identified a homozygous trp92-to-arg mutation in
the ATPAF2 gene (608918.0001).

the ATPAF2 gene, resulting in a trp92-to-arg substitution (W94R)
adjacent to a highly conserved glutamine. The consanguineous Moroccan
parents and a healthy sib were heterozygous for the mutation, which was
not found in 50 healthy Moroccan controls. The infant presented with
degenerative encephalopathy characterized by cortical and subcortical
atrophy and she had elevated lactate levels in urine, plasma, and CSF.
She had severe developmental delay with seizures and failure to thrive,
and died at 14 months of age from intercurrent infection.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Transforming growth factor-beta, or TGFB (see TGFB1; 190180), remains
biologically latent after secretion, blocked from activity by its
N-terminal propeptide (the latency-associated peptide, or LAP). TGFB is
activated by its dissociation from LAP. The latent form of TGFB is
secreted in association with a latent TGFB-binding protein, or LTBP (see
LTBP1; 150390), and assembled into the extracellular matrix. LTBPs are
mainly composed of epidermal growth factor (EGF; 131530)-like repeats
and protein domains with 8-cysteine repeats, both of which are also
found in fibrillins (e.g., 134797).

See Oklu and Hesketh (2000) for a review of the LTBP gene family.

CLONING

By searching an EST database for cDNAs encoding EGF-like
repeat-containing proteins, Giltay et al. (1997) identified a cDNA
encoding a deduced 1,587-amino acid protein, which they called LTBP4.
Northern blot analysis detected strong expression of an approximately
5-kb LTBP4 transcript in heart, with slightly lower expression in
skeletal muscle and pancreas, moderate expression in placenta and lung,
and weak or no expression in brain, liver, and kidney.

By searching an EST database for cDNAs encoding 8-cysteine
repeat-containing proteins, Saharinen et al. (1998) isolated a human
heart cDNA encoding a deduced 1,511-amino acid protein, which they
termed LTBP4S. The authors also obtained cDNAs encoding 3 alternatively
spliced forms of LTBP4, including a partial cDNA encoding an
N-terminally extended form of LTBP4S that they called LTBP4L. Northern
blot analysis detected a 5.1-kb LTBP4 transcript that was strongly
expressed in heart, uterus, and small intestine, and weakly expressed in
placenta, lung, and skeletal muscle. In addition to these tissues, dot
blot hybridization detected significant levels of LTBP4 mRNA in aorta,
ovary, and adrenal gland. Immunoblot analysis of serum-free medium of
fibroblast cultures detected a proteinase-sensitive LTBP4 protein of 250
kD that binds in a covalent complex with TGFB1-LAP and associates with
extracellular matrix.

MAPPING

By FISH, Saharinen et al. (1998) mapped the LTBP4 gene to chromosome
19q13.1-q13.2.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 4 unrelated patients with cutis laxa and severe pulmonary,
gastrointestinal, and urinary abnormalities (ARCL1C; 613177), Urban et
al. (2009) identified 5 homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in
the LTBP4 gene (604710.0001-604710.0005). Four of the mutations were
predicted to lead to premature termination codons, and one replaced a
highly conserved cysteine in a hybrid domain. Four of the 5 mutations
were located in a hybrid or an 8-cysteine domain, which are known to
have long-range effects on fibrillin and LTBP conformation.

Callewaert et al. (2013) analyzed the FBLN4 (604633), FBLN5 (604580),
and LTBP4 genes in 12 families with type I ARCL and identified
homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the LTBP4 gene in 9
families (see, e.g., 604710.0005-604710.0008). Homozygous mutations in
FLBN5 were identified in 2 families (604580.0010 and 604580.0011,
respectively). No mutations were found in the FBLN4 gene, and no
mutations were detected in 1 family in which the proband had cutis laxa
and bladder diverticula without obvious emphysema. Callewaert et al.
(2013) noted that the FBLN5 and LTBP4 mutations caused a very similar
phenotype associated with severe pulmonary emphysema in the absence of
vascular tortuosity or aneurysms. Gastointestinal and genitourinary
tract involvement seemed to be more severe in patients with LTBP4
mutations.

ANIMAL MODEL

By using a gene trap strategy that selects for integrations into genes
induced transiently during early mouse development, Sterner-Kock et al.
(2002) disrupted the mouse homolog of the human LTBP4 gene. Mice
homozygous for the disrupted allele developed severe pulmonary
emphysema, cardiomyopathy, and colorectal cancer. These highly
tissue-specific abnormalities were associated with profound defects in
the elastic fiber structure and with a reduced deposition of TGF-beta in
the extracellular space, resulting in epithelial cells with reduced
levels of phosphorylated Smad2 (601366) proteins, overexpression of
c-myc (190080), and uncontrolled proliferation. This phenotype supported
the predicted dual role of LTBP4 as a structural component of the
extracellular matrix and as a local regulator of TGF-beta tissue
deposition and signaling.

cys274-to-gly (C274G) substitution. The mutation occurred in a hybrid
domain.

CUTIS LAXA, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE, TYPE IC
LTBP4, 1-BP INS, 4128C

In a patient with cutis laxa and severe pulmonary, gastrointestinal, and
urinary abnormalities (ARCL1C; 613177), offspring of unrelated Hispanic
parents, Urban et al. (2009) identified compound heterozygosity for 2
mutations in the LTBP4 gene: C857X (604710.0003) and a 1-bp insertion
(4128insC) in exon 33 resulting in a frameshift and a truncated protein
(P1376fsX1403). The latter mutation occurred in an 8-cysteine domain.
Neither mutation was identified in the mother and the father was not
available for study.

In 2 sisters from a consanguineous family who had cutis laxa with
pulmonary and gastrointestinal involvement, Callewaert et al. (2013)
identified homozygosity for a 4127dupC mutation, which they stated was
the same mutation previously reported by Urban et al. (2009). The
mutation was present in heterozygosity in the unaffected parents. The
mother had had 3 spontaneous abortions, and an older brother with
generalized cutis laxa had died after a bowel rupture at 5 days of age.
In addition to cutis laxa, the proband had atrial septal defect with
dysplastic aortic and pulmonary valves, esophageal tortuosity, and
diaphragmatic hernia, and underwent gastric perforation. Her 8-year-old
sister also had bowel perforation which was surgically repaired, and
underwent Nissen fundoplasty and gastrostomy tube placement for volvulus
through a massive hiatal hernia; her other features included mitral
valve prolapse, palpitations, and syncope. Skin fibroblasts from the
proband showed residual expression of mutant LTBP4 mRNA, suggesting
partial escape from nonsense-mediated decay; this was confirmed by
immunoblotting analysis of conditioned media samples from mutant
fibroblasts, in which LTBP4 was detectable using an antibody against the
amino terminus but not with an antibody against the carboxy terminus.
Double immunostaining for LTBP4 and fibrillin-1 (134797) in patient
fibroblasts showed strong extracellular matrix staining and complete
colocalization with fibrillin-1 microfibrils, which were abnormally
thick and wavy, indicating that the truncated LTBP4 alters fibrillin-1
microfibril bundle formation and elongation. TGFB1 (190180) levels were
similar in patient fibroblasts and controls.

CUTIS LAXA, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE, TYPE IC
LTBP4, ARG448TER

In a 23-year-old woman with cutis laxa (ARCL1C; 613177) primarily
localized to the thorax, abdomen, and thighs, Callewaert et al. (2013)
identified compound heterozygosity for a 1342C-T transition in the LTBP4
gene, resulting in an arg448-to-ter (R448X) substitution in the first
8-cys domain, and a 1-bp duplication (4115dupC; 614710.0007), causing a
frameshift predicted to result in a premature termination codon
(tyr1373ilefs*2) in the third 8-cys domain. Additional features in this
patient included mild pulmonary emphysema, diaphragmatic hernia, severe
bladder diverticulae requiring an artificial bladder, rectal prolapse,
joint hypermobility, and mild facial dysmorphism with large ears and a
beaked nose. The patient had an affected sib who died at 2 years of age.
Patient fibroblasts showed greatly reduced expression of mutant LTBP4
compared to controls at both the mRNA and protein levels; double
immunostaining for LTBP4 and fibrillin-1 (134797) showed no
extracellular LTBP4 staining and fibrillin-1 microfibrils appeared
normal. Patient cells released significantly higher levels of TGFB1
(190180) than controls (p = 0.0001).

In a 13-year-old girl with mild cutis laxa associated with emphysema
(ARCL1C; 613177) who died of brain abscesses, Callewaert et al. (2013)
identified homozygosity for a 4129C-T transition in the LTBP4 gene,
resulting in an arg1337-to-ter (R1337X) substitution in the third 8-cys
domain. The patient's emphysema appeared mild on CT, but lung function
tests showed severe obstructive disease with a Tiffeneau index of 41%.
She had bladder diverticulae with secondary hydronephrosis, requiring
ureterostomy. Other features included patent foramen ovale, tricuspid
insufficiency, peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis, pulmonary
hypertension, and dysmorphism consisting of prominent forehead,
blepharochalasis, epicanthal folds, short nose, elongated and marked
philtrum, low-set large ears, webbed neck, and low posterior hairline.

120353	TITLE *120353 MATRIX METALLOPROTEINASE 1; MMP1
;;COLLAGENASE, FIBROBLAST; CLG; CLGN;;
COLLAGENASE, INTERSTITIAL
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Matrix metalloproteinases are zinc-dependent proteases that degrade
extracellular matrix proteins. MMP1 is also known as collagenase (EC
3.4.23.7) (Nagase et al., 1992).

CLONING

Brinckerhoff et al. (1987) identified a cDNA clone of human collagenase.
The clone identified a single collagenase gene of about 17 kb from blots
of human genomic DNA. Restriction enzyme analysis and DNA sequence data
indicated that the cDNA clone was full length and that it was identical
to that described for human skin fibroblast collagenase. Collagenase is
the only enzyme able to initiate breakdown of the interstitial
collagens, types I, II, and III. The fact that the collagens are the
most abundant proteins in the body means that collagenase plays a key
role in the remodeling that occurs constantly in both normal and
diseased conditions. The identity of human skin and synovial cell
collagenase and the ubiquity of this enzyme and of its substrates,
collagens I, II, and III, imply that the common mechanism controlling
collagenolysis throughout the body may be operative in both normal and
disease states.

MAPPING

Gerhard et al. (1987) confirmed the assignment of the collagenase gene
to chromosome 11 by the use of a DNA probe for Southern analysis of
somatic cell hybrids. Analysis of cell lines with rearrangements
involving chromosome 11 indicated that the gene is in the region
11q11-q23. Church et al. (1983) had used somatic cell hybrids between
mouse cells and human normal skin and corneal fibroblasts and recessive
dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB; 226600) skin fibroblasts to
assign the human structural gene for collagenase to chromosome 11.
Production of collagenase was measured by a specific radioimmunoassay.
It appeared that both the normal and the RDEB collagenase gene mapped to
chromosome 11. This was earlier taken to indicate that the abnormal
collagenase produced by RDEB cells represented a mutation of the
structural gene. Later work indicated that both the autosomal dominant
(131750) and autosomal recessive forms of dystrophic epidermolysis
bullosa are due to mutations in the type VII collagen gene (COL7A1;
120120). The excessive formation of collagenase must represent a
secondary phenomenon, not the primary defect. It should be noted that
fibroblasts from patients with the Werner syndrome (277700) also express
high constitutive levels of collagenase in vitro (Bauer et al., 1986).

Pendas et al. (1996) isolated a 1.5-Mb YAC clone mapping to 11q22.
Detailed analysis of this nonchimeric YAC clone ordered 7 MMP genes as
follows: cen--MMP8 (120355)--MMP10 (185260)--MMP1--MMP3 (185250)--MMP12
(601046)--MMP7 (178990)--MMP13 (600108)--tel.

GENE FUNCTION

Maymon et al. (2000) measured levels of MMP1 in amniotic fluid from 353
women, including those with intact membranes, in term or preterm labor
or not in labor, and those with term and premature rupture of the
membranes (610504), with or without microbial invasion of the amniotic
cavity. MMP1 was detectable in 81.3% (287 of 353) amniotic fluid
samples, and the concentration increased with increasing gestational
age. Analysis of the matrix metalloproteinase profile of amniotic fluid
in term and preterm rupture of membranes showed that patterns were
similar for every enzyme except MMP1 and MMP8 (120355), suggesting
different molecular pathophysiologic mechanisms for extracellular matrix
degradation of rupture of membranes in term and preterm gestations.
Maymon et al. (2000) concluded that MMP1 is implicated in the mechanisms
of membrane rupture.

Lahmann et al. (2001) found significantly more MMP1 mRNA in the buttock
skin of smokers than nonsmokers and suggested that smoking-induced MMP1
might be important in the skin-aging effects of tobacco smoking.

Saffarian et al. (2004) showed that activated collagenase (MMP1) moves
processively on the collagen fibril. The mechanism of movement is a
biased diffusion with the bias component dependent on the proteolysis of
its substrate, not ATP hydrolysis. Inactivation of the enzyme by a
single amino acid residue substitution in the active center eliminated
the bias without noticeable effect on rate of diffusion. Monte Carlo
simulations using a model similar to a 'burnt bridge' Brownian ratchet
accurately described the experimental result and previous observations
on kinetics of collagen digestion. Saffarian et al. (2004) concluded
that the biologic implications of MMP1 acting as a molecular ratchet
tethered to the cell surface suggested novel mechanisms for its role in
tissue remodeling and cell-matrix interaction.

Boire et al. (2005) found that expression of PAR1 (F2R; 187930) was both
required and sufficient to promote growth and invasion of breast
carcinoma cells in a xenograft mouse model. MMP1 acted as a protease
agonist of PAR1, cleaving the receptor at the proper site to generate
PAR1-dependent Ca(2+) signals and migration. MMP1 activity was derived
from fibroblasts and was absent from the breast cancer cells. These
results demonstrated that MMP1 in the stromal-tumor microenvironment can
alter the behavior of cancer cells through PAR1 to promote cell
migration and invasion.

By in vivo selection, transcriptomic analysis, functional verification,
and clinical validation, Minn et al. (2005) identified a set of genes
that marks and mediates breast cancer metastasis to the lungs. Some of
these genes serve dual functions, providing growth advantages both in
the primary tumor and in the lung microenvironment. Others contribute to
aggressive growth selectivity in the lung. Among the lung metastasis
signature genes identified, several, including MMP1 (p less than
0.000001), were functionally validated. Two that were not functionally
validated but that achieved the highest statistical significance (p less
than 0.000001) were FSCN1 (602689) and angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4;
605910). Those subjects expressing the lung metastasis signature had a
significantly poorer lung metastasis-free survival, but not bone
metastasis-free survival, compared to subjects without the signature.

Metastasis entails numerous biologic functions that collectively enable
cancerous cells from a primary site to disseminate and overtake distant
organs. Using genetic and pharmacologic approaches, Gupta et al. (2007)
showed that the epidermal growth factor receptor ligand epiregulin
(602061), the cyclooxygenase COX2 (600262), and the matrix
metalloproteinases MMP1 and MMP2 (120360), when expressed in human
breast cancer cells, collectively facilitate the assembly of new tumor
blood vessels, the release of tumor cells into the circulation, and the
breaching of lung capillaries by circulating tumor cells to seed
pulmonary metastasis. Gupta et al. (2007) concluded that their findings
revealed how aggressive primary tumorigenic functions can be
mechanistically coupled to greater lung metastatic potential, and how
such biologic activities can be therapeutically targeted with specific
drug combinations.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Joos et al. (2002) found an association between a 1-bp insertion in the
MMP1 gene (G-1607GG; dbSNP rs1799750; 120353.0001) and the rate of
decline of lung function in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD;
606963).

Fujimoto et al. (2002) analyzed the G-1607GG promoter polymorphism in
the MMP1 gene in 75 African American infants who were born after preterm
premature rupture of the membranes (PPROM; 610504) and 235 controls, and
found a significant association between fetal carriage of a 2G allele
and PPROM (OR = 2.29; p = 0.028).

In studies in amnion fibroblasts, Wang et al. (2008) found that
inhibition of DNA methylation resulted in significantly increased MMP1
gene transcription and an associated significant increase in MMP1
production. These effects were correlated with reduced DNA methylation
at a specific site, -1538C, in the MMP1 promoter, and DNA methylation at
that site was reduced in a larger percentage of fetal membranes that
ruptured prematurely. The authors identified another SNP, 3447T-C
(numbering based on AF007878.1; dbSNP rs2075847), and observed that the
minor C allele was always methylated in vivo and that methylation
resulted in increased affinity for a nuclear protein in amnion
fibroblasts. Plasmid transfection studies and chromatin
immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated reduced promoter activity of the
minor C allele. In a case-control study involving 284 African American
neonates from pregnancies complicated by PPROM and 361 African American
neonates from normal term pregnancies, Wang et al. (2008) found the
minor C allele to be protective against PPROM (OR = 0.7451; p = 0.0326),
consistent with its reduced promoter function. Neonates homozygous for
the major T allele had 3.51-higher risk for PPROM compared to CC
homozygotes (p = 0.007). Wang et al. (2008) concluded that, in addition
to genetic variation, DNA methylation plays a role in controlling MMP1
expression and risk of PPROM.

Titeux et al. (2008) demonstrated that the G-1607GG polymorphism in MMP1
results in transcriptional upregulation. They found a significant
association between this SNP and disease severity among patients with
autosomal recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB; 226600).

Rutter et al. (1998) identified a SNP (dbSNP rs1799750) in the promoter
region of the MMP1 gene (position -1607) where an additional guanine
nucleotide creates a binding site for members of the Ets family of
transcription factors. The 2G SNP displayed significantly higher
transcription in normal fibroblasts and in melanoma cells compared to
the 1G SNP. The occurrence of 2G homozygotes was 30% in 100 CEPH
controls; in tumor cell lines it was 62.5%. Rutter et al. (1998)
suggested that increased MMP1 expression contributes to stromal
degradation involved in tumor invasion.

Rate of Decline of Lung Function in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary
Disease

Joos et al. (2002) investigated the role of MMP polymorphisms (including
G-1607GG in MMP1 and N357S in MMP12) in the development of chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (see 606963). The authors determined the
prevalence of these polymorphisms in 590 continuing smokers chosen from
the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Lung Health Study for
having the fastest (284 individuals) and slowest (306 individuals)
5-year rate of decline of lung function. Of 5 polymorphisms among 3 MMP
loci, only G-1607GG was associated with a rate of decline in lung
function. This allele was associated with a fast rate of decline (p =
0.02). However, haplotypes consisting of alleles from the G-1607GG and
N357S polymorphisms were associated with rate of decline of lung
function (p = 0.0007). Joos et al. (2002) concluded that polymorphisms
in the MMP1 and MMP12 genes, but not MMP9, are either causative factors
in smoking-related lung injury or are in linkage disequilibrium with
causative polymorphisms.

Preterm Premature Rupture of the Membranes

Fujimoto et al. (2002) studied the G-1607GG promoter polymorphism in
amnion-derived cells and found that the 2G promoter had more than 2-fold
greater activity than the 1G allele. Induction of MMP1 mRNA by phorbol
12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) was significantly greater in cells with a
1G/2G or 2G/2G genotype compared to cells homozygous for the 1G allele.
Analysis in 75 African American infants who were born after preterm
premature rupture of the membranes (PPROM; 610504) and 235 controls
demonstrated a significant association between fetal carriage of a 2G
allele and PPROM (OR = 2.29; p = 0.028). The authors concluded that the
2G allele has stronger promoter activity in amnion cells, that it
confers increased responsiveness of amnion cells to stimuli that induce
MMP1, and that this polymorphism contributes to the risk of PPROM.

Modifier of Epidermolysis Bullosa Dystrophica

Titeux et al. (2008) demonstrated that the G-1607GG polymorphism (dbSNP
rs1799750) in MMP1 results in transcriptional upregulation. The authors
found a significant association between this SNP and disease severity
among patients with autosomal recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa
(RDEB; 226600). In 3 affected sibs and a follow-up cohort of 31
unrelated French patients, the functional SNP resulting in increased
collagenase activity was associated with a more severe phenotype (p =
6.27 x 10(-5)). Titeux et al. (2008) concluded that increased MMP1 leads
to increased collagen degradation and worsening disease severity,
suggesting that MMP1 is a modifier gene in RDEB.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Transmembrane 4 (4TM) superfamily proteins are membrane proteins with 4
conserved transmembrane domains. Fitter et al. (1995) showed that the
platelet surface glycoprotein gp27 identified by Ashman et al. (1991) is
a member of this group. Fitter et al. (1995) cloned the gp27 gene,
designated PETA3 by them, by sequencing purified protein and using the
resulting probes in RT-PCR to obtain a cDNA from megakaryoblastic cells.
Fitter et al. (1995) assigned this 253-amino acid protein to the 4TM
group because it has 4 predicted hydrophobic regions and 30% homology to
other members of the group. Northern blot analysis showed that PETA3 is
expressed in most tissues, but not in brain. Hasegawa et al. (1996)
cloned the same gene, which they named SFA1, during a screen for genes
induced by HTLV-1 transformation in T cells. The 62-bp difference
between the 5-prime untranslated regions of the PETA3 and SFA1 cDNAs was
ascribed to alternative splicing in an erratum to Hasegawa et al.
(1996).

Bill et al. (1987) cloned the MER2 (179620) gene using a strategy that
involved cotransfection of resistance to an antibiotic.

GENE FUNCTION

Hemidesmosomes are specialized junctional complexes that function as
cell-attachment sites for binding to basement membranes. They appear as
electron-dense structures, resembling half a desmosome. Alpha-6 (ITGA6;
147556)/beta-4 (ITGB4; 147557) integrin is a major component of
hemidesmosomes. In addition to ITGA6/ITGB4, classic type I
hemidesmosomes contain BP180 (COL17A1; 113811) and BP230 (BPAG1;
113810), while type II hemidesmosomes, which are found in cylindrical
epithelia, contain plectin (601282). Using immunohistochemistry and
immunoelectron microscopy, Sterk et al. (2000) identified CD151, but not
the tetraspanins CD9 (143030) or CD81 (186845), codistributed with
ITGA6/ITGB4 in hemidesmosomes but not desmosomes at the basolateral
surfaces of basal keratinocytes. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot
analysis showed that CD151 associates with ITGA6/ITGB4 and with ITGA3
(605025)/ITGB1 (135630), but not with ITGA5 (135620)/ITGB1. In pyloric
atresia-junctional epidermolysis bullosa (PA-JEB; 226730) cells lacking
ITGB4 (thus lacking hemidesmosomes), CD151 colocalized with ITGA3/ITGB1.
Expression of ITGB4 in PA-JEB cells induced surface expression of
ITGA6/ITGB4 in hemidesmosomes together with CD151 and the apparent
replacement of ITGA3/ITGB1. Fluorescent microscopy showed that CD151 is
a component of both type I and type II hemidesmosomes. The authors
demonstrated that recruitment of CD151 requires the heterodimerization
of ITGB4 with ITGA6, with which CD151 is associated.

The 4-transmembrane domain superfamily (the tetraspanins) are integral
cell membrane proteins comprising at least 28 members in mammals.
Tetraspanins are widely distributed on animal cells, and several are
known to be expressed on human hematopoietic cells, including CD151.
Tetraspanin CD151 forms very stable laminin-binding complexes with
integrins alpha-3-beta-1 (605025; 135630) and alpha-6-beta-1 (147556;
135630) in kidney and alpha-3-beta-1 and alpha-6-beta-4 (147558; 147557)
in skin. Karamatic Crew et al. (2004) demonstrated that CD151 expresses
the MER2 blood group antigen and is located on erythrocytes.

CD151 is highly expressed in megakaryocytes and, to a lesser extent, in
platelets. Using Cd151-deficient mice, Lau et al. (2004) provided the
first direct evidence that CD151 is essential for normal platelet
function and that disruption of CD151 induces a moderate outside-in
integrin alpha-IIb-beta-3 (see 607759, 173470) signaling defect.

GENE STRUCTURE

By PCR and genomic sequence analyses, Whittock and McLean (2001)
determined that the CD151 gene contains 8 exons spanning 4.3 kb, with
exons 2 to 8 encoding the CD151 protein. They also described a PCR-based
mutation-detection strategy to facilitate identification of pathogenic
mutations in patients with fragile skin and mucous membranes.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Karamatic Crew et al. (2004) studied the CD151 gene in 3 patients who
were negative for the blood group antigen MER2 (179620), which is
expressed by the CD151 tetraspanin. The patients were of Indian Jewish
origin and had end-stage kidney disease. In addition to hereditary
nephritis, the sibs had sensorineural deafness, pretibial epidermolysis
bullosa, and beta-thalassemia minor. All 3 patients were homozygous for
a single-nucleotide insertion in exon 5 of CD151, causing a frameshift
and premature stop signal at codon 140 (602243.0001). The resultant
truncated protein would lack its integrin-binding domain. Karamatic Crew
et al. (2004) concluded that CD151 is essential for the proper assembly
of the glomerular and tubular basement membrane in kidney, has
functional significance in the skin, is probably a component of the
inner ear, and could play a role in erythropoiesis, as suggested by the
presence of beta-thalassemia minor.

MAPPING

Hasegawa et al. (1997) mapped the PETA3 gene to 11p15.5 by fluorescence
in situ hybridization. Whittock and McLean (2001) confirmed that the
CD151 gene maps to 11p15.5 by radiation hybrid analysis.

Daniels et al. (1987) assigned the MER2 locus to 11p15 by study of
somatic cell hybrids.

ANIMAL MODEL

Wright et al. (2004) generated mice with a homozygous deletion of all 6
coding exons of the Cd151 gene. The Cd151 -/- mice were viable, fertile,
and healthy, with normal blood and marrow cell counts and normal tissue
morphology and integrin expression in skin. However, the mice had a
minor abnormality in hemostasis, with longer bleeding times, greater
blood loss, and increased incidence of spontaneous tail vein rebleeding.
Cd151 -/- keratinocytes migrated poorly in skin explant cultures, and
mutant lymphocytes were hyperproliferative after mitogen stimulation in
vitro. Wright et al. (2004) noted that other tetraspanin deletion
mutants produce mild phenotypes and suggested that this may be due to
complementation by other tetraspanins or that these proteins function as
modifiers rather than as essential components of the molecular complexes
in which they participate.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
NEPHROPATHY WITH PRETIBIAL EPIDERMOLYSIS BULLOSA AND DEAFNESS
CD151, 1-BP INS, G383

In 3 MER2-negative patients of Indian Jewish origin with end-stage
kidney disease (609057), Karamatic Crew et al. (2004) found homozygosity
for a single-nucleotide insertion (G383) in exon 5 of the CD151 gene,
causing a frameshift and premature stop signal in codon 140. The
resultant truncated protein would lack its integrin-binding domain. The
findings suggested that CD151 is essential for the proper assembly of
the glomerular and tubular basement membrane in kidney, as well as
having functional significance in skin and probably the inner ear.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Serine proteases are endopeptidases that are involved in multiple
biologic processes, including proteolytic processing of proteins,
digestion, blood coagulation, immune response, and development.
Trypsin-like serine proteases (EC 3.4.21.4), such as PRSS3, catalyze the
hydrolysis of peptide bonds on the carboxyl side of lysine or arginine
residues (summary by Wiegand et al., 1993).

CLONING

Using a porcine trypsinogen cDNA probe to screen a human pancreas cDNA
library, Tani et al. (1990) cloned PRSS3, which they called trypsinogen
III. The deduced 247-amino acid protein has N-terminal signal and
activation processing sites and shares 85.0% and 86.6% identity with
trypsinogen I (PRSS1; 276000) and trypsinogen II (PRSS2; 601564),
respectively.

Using degenerate primers to amplify cDNAs encoding serine proteases from
total human brain mRNA, followed by screening genomic DNA for a 5-prime
fragment, Wiegand et al. (1993) cloned a PRSS3 splice variant that they
called trypsinogen IV. Trypsinogen IV differs from trypsinogen III (Tani
et al., 1990) only in the first exon. The deduced 304-amino acid protein
has characteristics of a serine protease, including a conserved
his-asp-ser catalytic triad and residues involved in substrate
recognition. PCR of brain and pancreas revealed tissue-specific
expression of the 2 PRSS3 variants.

Nyaruhucha et al. (1997) cloned PRSS3, which they called
mesotrypsinogen, from a pancreas cDNA library. The deduced protein
contains 247 amino acids.

GENE FUNCTION

Using purified human protein expressed in E. coli, Nyaruhucha et al.
(1997) showed that mesotrypsinogen cleaved a synthetic trypsin
substrate, but only following activation by enterokinase (PRSS7;
606635). Recombinant mesotrypsin showed resistance to proteinaceous
inhibitors and sensitivity to small pharmacologic serine protease
inhibitors, similar to purified human mesotrypsin. Significantly,
mesotrypsin was resistant to inhibition by soybean trypsin inhibitor
(SBTI) and the physiologic pancreatic serine protease inhibitor PSTI
(SPINK1; 167790).

Szmola et al. (2003) found that mesotrypsin did not autoactivate and did
not activate other pancreatic zymogens. They noted that mesotrypsin
contains arg198 in place of the signature gly198 found in
chymotrypsin-like serine proteases. Mutation of arg198 to gly partially
restored the ability of mesotrypsin to activate pancreatic zymogens and
restored its binding and sensitivity to the protein trypsin inhibitors
SBTI and SPINK1. Szmola et al. (2003) noted that in complexes of
proteases and canonical protease inhibitors, the reactive-site peptide
bond of the inhibitor is slowly cleaved. On the contrary, mesotrypsin
rapidly cleaved and deactivated SBTI and SPINK1. Szmola et al. (2003)
concluded that mesotrypsin has a role in degrading trypsin inhibitors
and suggested that it may function in digestion of foods high in
naturally occurring trypsin inhibitors.

Two of the 3 isoforms of amyloid precursor protein (APP; 104760) are
ubiquitously expressed and contain a 56-residue Kunitz-type serine
protease inhibitor domain. Secreted APP containing the Kunitz domain is
called protease nexin-2 and potently inhibits serine proteases. Using an
affinity-based proteomic screen, Salameh et al. (2010) showed that
mesotrypsin bound protease nexin-2. Mesotrypsin efficiently cleaved
protease nexin-2 and thereby compromised its ability to inhibit other
serine proteases.

GENE STRUCTURE

Wiegand et al. (1993) reported that the PRSS3 gene contains 6 coding
exons, including 2 alternate first exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Rowen et al. (1996) mapped the PRSS3 gene,
which they called T9, to chromosome 9p13. They found that this region of
chromosome 9, which also contains the PRSS1 and PRSS2 genes and several
trypsinogen pseudogenes, arose via a translocation event from chromosome
7q35.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Peshavaria and Day (1991) determined that the ENO3 gene encodes a
deduced 433-amino acid protein.

MAPPING

Chen and Giblett (1976) and Pearce et al. (1976) presented evidence for
3 enolase loci. By in situ hybridization studies using a probe for ENO2
(131360), Craig et al. (1989) found small aggregates of grains at
1pter-p36, the site of ENO1 (172430), and some at 17pter-p12.

Feo et al. (1990) mapped the muscle-specific beta-enolase (ENO3) to
chromosome 17pter-p11 by analysis of rodent-human somatic cell hybrids
and transfectant cell lines carrying different portions of chromosome
17. This muscle-specific enzyme maps to the region encoding the gene
cluster for the sarcomeric myosin heavy chains (MYH1; 160730).

GENE STRUCTURE

Peshavaria and Day (1991) determined that the ENO3 gene contains 12
exons and spans approximately 6 kb.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a man with glycogen storage disease XIII (GSD13; 612932), Comi et al.
(2001) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the ENO3
gene (G156D, 131370.0001; G374E, 131370.0002). Immunohistochemistry and
immunoblotting detected dramatically reduced beta-enolase protein in
this patient, while alpha-enolase was normally represented.

607419	TITLE *607419 GEM-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 7; GEMIN7
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

GEMIN7 is part of the large macromolecular SMN complex (see 600354),
which is localized to both the cytoplasm and the nucleus and plays a
role in the cytoplasmic assembly of small nuclear ribonuculeoproteins
(snRNPs).

CLONING

Pellizzoni et al. (2002) identified a number of proteins that
coimmunoprecipitate with SMN or with GEMIN2 (602595) from lysates of
human kidney cells, including GEMIN6 (607006) and a 15-kD protein.
Baccon et al. (2002) sequenced the 15-kD protein, which they called
GEMIN7, identified corresponding ESTs, and cloned GEMIN7 by PCR
amplification of a cDNA library. The deduced 131-amino acid GEMIN7
protein contains several RG repeats. By EST database searching, Baccon
et al. (2002) also identified the putative mouse ortholog, which shares
82% amino acid sequence identity with the human protein.

GENE FUNCTION

Using coimmunoprecipitation and immunolocalization experiments, Baccon
et al. (2002) demonstrated that GEMIN7 is a component of the SMN complex
and colocalizes with SMN in the cytoplasm and in gems. Binding
experiments showed that GEMIN7 interacts directly with SMN and GEMIN6
and mediates the association of GEMIN6 with the SMN complex. The RG
repeats were necessary for its interaction with SMN. GEMIN7 also
interacted with several Sm proteins of snRNPs, particularly with SmE
(SNRPE; 128260).

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the GEMIN7
gene to chromosome 19 (TMAP SHGC-112).

116957	TITLE *116957 RETINOBLASTOMA-LIKE 1; RBL1
;;CELLULAR PROTEIN p107; CP107; p107
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Ewen et al. (1991) obtained a partial cDNA for human RBL1, which they
called p107. The cDNA encodes a 936-residue protein. Comparison with RB1
(614041) showed a major region of homology extending over 564 residues.
This region in RB1 is essential to its growth-controlling function.
Sequences outside of this region are largely unique to each protein.

Kim et al. (1995) showed that the 4.9- and 2.4-kb Rbl1 transcripts of
the fetal mouse are a consequence of alternative splicing. The larger
message encodes a 119-kD protein and the smaller a 68-kD protein.

Huppi et al. (1996) cloned the mouse Rbl1 gene and compared its sequence
with its human counterpart. The extreme N-terminal and C-terminal
regions are the most conserved between the 2 sequences.

Using in situ hybridization, Vanderluit et al. (2004) found that p107
was expressed in a few select cells along the lateral ventricles of
adult mice. Western blot analysis detected p107 expression in neural
precursor cells from wildtype embryonic day-10 and adult neurospheres,
which are derived from multipotent stem cells.

GENE FUNCTION

The cellular protein p107, like RB1, had been shown to form a specific
complex with adenovirus E1A and SV40 large T antigen (T). The binding
characteristics implied that RB1 and p107 share a common biochemical
function (Ewen et al., 1991).

SMAD3 (603109) is a direct mediator of transcriptional activation by the
TGF-beta (190180) receptor (see 190181). Its target genes in epithelial
cells include cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK; see 116953) inhibitors that
generate a cytostatic response. Chen et al. (2002) defined how, in the
same context, SMAD3 can mediate transcriptional repression of the
growth-promoting gene MYC (190080). A complex containing SMAD3, the
transcription factors E2F4 (600659), E2F5 (600967), and DP1 (189902),
and the corepressor p107 preexists in the cytoplasm. In response to
TGF-beta, this complex moves into the nucleus and associates with SMAD4
(600993), recognizing a composite SMAD-E2F site on MYC for repression.
Previously known as the ultimate recipients of CDK regulatory signals,
E2F4/E2F5 and p107 act here as transducers of TGF-beta receptor signals
upstream of CDK. SMAD proteins therefore mediate transcriptional
activation or repression depending on their associated partners.

Williams et al. (2006) found that mouse fibroblasts lacking Rb were less
susceptible to an oncogenic HRAS (190020) allele than wildtype cells.
Depletion of RB from HRAS-transformed mouse cells or human tumor cells
harboring HRAS pathway mutations inhibited their proliferation and
anchorage-independent growth. In contrast to Rb -/- mouse fibroblasts,
p107 -/- and p130 (RBL2; 180203) -/- fibroblasts were more susceptible
to HRAS-mediated transformation than wildtype cells. Moreover, loss of
RB in human tumor cells harboring an HRAS mutation resulted in increased
expression of p107, and overexpression of p107, but not RB, strongly
inhibited proliferation of these tumor cells. Williams et al. (2006)
concluded that RB and p107 have distinct roles in HRAS-mediated
transformation and that p107 has a role as a tumor suppressor in the
context of activated HRAS.

Dgcr8 (609030)-knockout mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells lack microRNAs
(miRNAs), proliferate slowly, and accumulate in G1 phase of the cell
cycle. By screening mouse miRNAs for those that could rescue the growth
defect in Dgcr8-knockout mouse ES cells, Wang et al. (2008) identified a
group of related ES cell-specific miRNAs, including several members of
the miR290 cluster. Target sites for these miRNAs were identified in the
3-prime UTRs of several inhibitors of the cyclin E (see CCNE1;
123837)-CDK2 pathway, including Cdkn1a (116899), Rb1, Rbl1, Rbl2, and
Lats2 (604861). Quantitative RT-PCR confirmed increased expression of
these genes in Dgcr8-knockout mouse ES cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ichimura et al. (2000) determined that the RBL1 gene contains 22 exons
and spans more than 100 kb.

MAPPING

Ewen et al. (1991) used a partial cDNA for human p107 to map the gene to
20q11.2 by fluorescence in situ hybridization.

Huppi et al. (1996) found that the mouse Rbl1 gene maps to the distal
end of chromosome 2, as does also the E2f1 gene (189971).

ANIMAL MODEL

LeCouter et al. (1998) introduced a null mutation in p107 into the germ
line of mice and bred into a BALB/cJ genetic background. Mice lacking
p107 were viable and fertile but displayed impaired growth, reaching
about 50% of normal weight by 21 days of age. Mutant mice exhibited a
myeloproliferative disorder characterized by ectopic myeloid hyperplasia
in the spleen and liver. Embryonic p107 -/- fibroblasts and primary
myoblasts isolated from adult p107 -/- mice displayed a striking 2-fold
acceleration in doubling time. However, cell sort analysis indicated
that the fraction of cells in G1, S, and G2 was unaltered, suggesting
that the different phases of the cell cycle in p107 -/- cells was
uniformly reduced by a factor of 2. Western analysis of cyclin
expression in synchronized p107 -/- fibroblasts revealed that expression
of cyclins E and A preceded that of D1. Mutant embryos expressed
approximately twice the normal levels of Rb, whereas p130 levels were
unaltered. Finally, mutant mice reverted to a wildtype phenotype
following a single backcross with C57BL/6J mice, suggesting the
existence of modifier genes that have potentially epistatic
relationships with p107. LeCouter et al. (1998) concluded that p107 has
an important role in negatively regulating the rate of progression of
the cell cycle, but in a strain-dependent manner.

To examine the role of p107 in mouse lateral ventricles, Vanderluit et
al. (2004) developed p107-null mice. Adult mutant mice had elevated
numbers of proliferating progenitor cells in their lateral ventricles.
In vitro neurosphere assays revealed an increase in the number of
neurosphere-forming cells from p107 -/- brains that exhibited enhanced
capacity for self-renewal. An expanded stem cell population in
p107-deficient mice was indicated in vivo by increased numbers of slowly
cycling cells in the lateral ventricles and accelerated rates of neural
precursor repopulation after progenitor ablation. Notch1 (190198) was
upregulated in mutant neurospheres in vitro and brains in vivo.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation and p107 overexpression suggested that
p107 may modulate the Notch1 pathway. Vanderluit et al. (2004) concluded
that p107 negatively regulates the number of neural stem cells in
developing and adult brain, a function distinct from that of Rb.

Haigis et al. (2006) found that Rb was expressed in all epithelial cells
of mouse colon, whereas p107 was expressed predominantly in the lower
half of the crypt, and p130 was expressed in the upper portion of the
crypt and in the epithelium lining the lumen. Similarly,
undifferentiated cells in the mouse small intestinal crypt expressed Rb
and p107, whereas differentiated cells in the villi expressed Rb and
p130. Conditional deletion of Rb or p130 increased p107 levels, and
Rb/p130 double mutants had even higher levels of p107. Although mutating
any of these 3 genes singly had little or no effect, loss of Rb and p107
or p130 together produced chronic hyperplasia and dysplasia of the small
intestinal and colonic epithelium. In Rb/p130 double mutants, this
hyperplasia was associated with defects in terminal differentiation of
specific cell types and was dependent on the increased proliferation
seen in the epithelium of mutant animals.

186820	TITLE *186820 T-CELL ANTIGEN CD7; CD7
;;Tp41
DESCRIPTION The CD7 antigen is a cell surface glycoprotein found on thymocytes and
mature T cells. It is one of the earliest antigens to appear on cells of
the T-lymphocyte lineage and the most reliable clinical marker of T-cell
acute lymphocytic leukemia. Aruffo and Seed (1987) isolated and
sequenced a full-length CD7 cDNA as well as a cDNA for an unusual
intron-bearing precursor. They found that COS cells expressing CD7 do
not bind IgM. Van Dongen et al. (1985) assigned T-cell antigen Tp41
(CD7) to chromosome 17 by somatic cell hybridization. Osada et al.
(1988) confirmed the location of CD7 on chromosome 17 by studying
reactivity with Tp40 antibody in hybrid human-mouse T-cell clones. By
chromosomal in situ hybridization, Baker et al. (1990) localized CD7 to
17q25.2-q25.3. Schanberg et al. (1991) isolated and characterized the
human CD7 gene and its 5-prime flanking region; the gene comprises 4
exons that span 3.5 kb. Comparison of the organization of the CD7 gene
with that of other members of the immunoglobulin gene superfamily
revealed that the human CD7 gene most closely resembles the murine Thy-1
gene (188230). Both genes have 4 exons and promoters with no TATA boxes.
Yoshikawa et al. (1991) cloned and characterized the CD7 gene.

Jung et al. (1986) found that the T-cell surface membrane-associated
glycoprotein CD7, which they referred to as Tp40 (40,000 MW), was not
expressed by the T cells of a patient with severe combined
immunodeficiency. In addition to this abnormality, T-cell proliferative
responses to mitogens were defective and the IL2 receptor expression was
deficient on the patient's T lymphocytes. However, his T cells were
found to provide help for the differentiation of normal B cells to
Ig-secreting cells. Abundant circulating B cells were detected. The
findings were interpreted as supporting the idea that the Tp40
deficiency was related to a defect in T-cell precursors, and that Tp40
plays an essential role not only in T-cell interactions but also in
certain aspects of T-cell/B-cell interaction during early lymphoid
development. However, Bonilla et al. (1997) found that targeted
disruption of the mouse CD7 gene (located on chromosome 11 in that
species), with resulting CD7 deficiency, was associated with normal
histology of thymus and spleen, normal lymphocyte populations in primary
and secondary lymphoid tissues, and normal serum Ig levels. Specific
antibody responses after immunization with T-dependent and T-independent
antigens were equivalent in wildtype and CD7 knockout mice.
CD7-deficient lymphocytes responded normally to T-cell mitogenic and
allogeneic stimuli, and displayed normal NK cell cytotoxicity.

602572	TITLE *602572 ANNEXIN A11; ANXA11
;;ANNEXIN XI; ANX11;;
AUTOANTIGEN, 56-KD
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ANXA11 is a member of the annexin family of calcium-dependent
phospholipid-binding proteins. Annexins have unique N-terminal domains
and homologous C-terminal domains containing the calcium-dependent
phospholipid-binding sites.

CLONING

To identify a 56-kD antigen recognized by sera from patients with
autoimmune diseases, Misaki et al. (1994) screened a human
teratocarcinoma cDNA expression library with the anti-56-kD antigen
autoantibodies. They isolated a cDNA predicting a 505-amino acid protein
with 60% identity to other annexins in the conserved C-terminal domain
and 92.5% identity to bovine annexin XI over the entire protein. Misaki
et al. (1994) concluded that the 56-kD autoantigen is human annexin XI,
or ANXA11.

GENE STRUCTURE

Bances et al. (2000) determined that the mouse Anxa11 gene contains 15
exons and spans 40 kB. Exon 1 is untranslated, and intron 1 spans about
20 kb. The human ANXA11 gene has the same general structure as the mouse
gene; however, EST database analysis indicated that human ANXA11
transcripts also use variably spliced exons 1b and 1c, which can
lengthen the 5-prime UTR. The intronic sequences of the mouse and human
ANXA11 genes contain several types of repetitive elements, including
retroviral long terminal repeats. The mouse promoter region contains a
remnant LINE-1 insertion not found in the human gene. The 5-prime
flanking region of the ANXA11 gene contains a CpG island and MYOD
(159970), SP1 (189906), and glucocorticoid response elements, but no
proximal TATA or CAAT boxes.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

For discussion of a possible association between variation in the ANXA11
gene and susceptibility to sarcoidosis, see SS3 (612388).

MAPPING

Morgan et al. (1998) mapped the ANXA11 gene to 10q22.3-q23.1 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization.

By genomic sequence analysis, Bances et al. (2000) mapped the mouse
Anxa11 gene to chromosome 14.

614471	TITLE *614471 UBIQUITIN-SPECIFIC PROTEASE 19; USP19
;;KIAA0891
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

USP19 is a ubiquitin protein ligase (EC 3.4.19.12) with a role in
regulating cell cycle progression (Lu et al., 2009).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) cloned USP19, which they designated
KIAA0891. The deduced 1,371-amino acid protein shares significant
similarity with the ubiquitin protease UNPH (USP4; 603486). RT-PCR ELISA
detected highest expression in fetal liver, followed by adult spinal
cord. All other tissues, including adult and fetal brain, showed much
lower expression, and no expression was detected in spleen.

GENE FUNCTION

p27(KIP1) (CDKN1B; 600778) is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that
regulates the G1/S transition. Using rat myoblast and fibroblast cell
lines, Lu et al. (2009) showed that Usp19 regulated p27(KIP1) levels by
deubiquitinating and stabilizing Kpc1 (RNF123; 614472), an E3 ubiquitin
ligase that ubiquitinates cytosolic p27(KIP1) and targets it for
proteasomal degradation at G1 phase. Immunoprecipitation analysis
revealed that Usp19 interacted directly with Kpc1. Knockdown of Usp19
resulted in loss of Kpc1, accumulation of p27(KIP1), inhibition of cell
proliferation, and slower progression from G0/G1 to S phase.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the USP19 gene
to chromosome 3.

Hartz (2011) mapped the USP19 gene to chromosome 3p21.31 based on an
alignment of the USP19 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AB020698) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

604764	TITLE *604764 ZINC FINGER AND HOMEODOMAIN PROTEIN 1; ZHX1
DESCRIPTION NFYA (189903), NFYB (189904), and NFYC (605344) comprise the
heterotrimeric transcription factor known as nuclear factor Y (NF-Y), or
CCAAT-binding protein (CBF). NF-Y binds many CCAAT box elements and Y
box elements, which are inverted CCAAT boxes. Mutations of these
elements that disrupt the binding of NF-Y result in decreased
transcription from various tissue-specific and inducible promoters. To
identify proteins that interact with NF-Y and that may play a role in
tissue-specific or hormone-inducible promoter activity, Yamada et al.
(1999) screened a human liver cDNA library using a yeast 2-hybrid system
with the NFYA subunit as bait. They isolated a partial ZHX1 cDNA lacking
5-prime coding sequence. Yamada et al. (1999) subsequently cloned the
remaining ZHX1 coding sequence. The predicted 873-amino acid ZHX1
protein contains 2 N-terminal zinc fingers, 5 central and C-terminal
homeodomains, a C-terminal acidic region, and 2 putative nuclear
localization signals. Human and mouse ZHX1 share 91% amino acid sequence
identity. The authors demonstrated that ZHX1 specifically interacts with
NFYA both in vivo and in vitro. This interaction does not require the
zinc fingers of ZHX1. Northern blot analysis detected major 4.5- and
5-kb ZHX1 transcripts in all tissues tested, namely heart, lung, liver,
pancreas, kidney, brain, skeletal muscle, and placenta. The 5-kb
transcript was more highly expressed than the 4.5-kb transcript in most
of these tissues.

By analysis of a somatic cell hybrid panel, Yamada et al. (1999) mapped
the ZHX1 gene to chromosome 8. They localized the ZHX1 gene to 8q by
radiation hybrid mapping.

608503	TITLE *608503 POLY(rC)-BINDING PROTEIN 4; PCBP4
;;ALPHA-CP4;;
MCG10
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The poly(rC)-binding proteins are a subfamily of KH-domain-containing
RNA-binding proteins that bind C-rich pyrimidine tracts and play pivotal
roles in a broad spectrum of posttranscriptional events (Chkheidze and
Liebhaber, 2003).

CLONING

By subtraction hybridization for genes induced by p53 (191170) in a lung
cancer cell line, Zhu and Chen (2000) cloned PCBP4, which they
designated MCG10. They also identified an alternatively spliced
transcript, which they designated MCG10as. The deduced proteins contain
424 and 369 amino acids. Each protein contains an N-terminal KH (HNRNPK
(600712)-homology) domain, a C-terminal KH domain, 3 proline-rich
domains, a potential nuclear export signal, and a potential nuclear
localization signal.

Based on its sequence similarity with mouse and human PCBP2 (601210),
Makeyev and Liebhaber (2000) cloned mouse Pcbp4, and using this sequence
as query to search an EST database, they identified human PCBP4. Both
mouse and human PCBP4 encode 403-amino acid proteins with calculated
molecular masses of 41.5 kD. PCBP4 contains 2 KH domains in the
N-terminal half, and 1 near the C terminus. Quantitative RT-PCR detected
expression in all mouse tissues examined.

Chkheidze and Liebhaber (2003) cloned a PCBP4 transcript that encodes a
deduced 329-amino acid protein. Epitope-tagged PCBP4 localized to the
cytosol of transfected HeLa cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Zhu and Chen (2000) found that PCBP4 was induced following p53
expression in a lung cancer cell line. Expression of a p53 mutant
defective in transactivation, and a p53 lacking the proline-rich domain,
did not induce PCBP4 expression. Chemically-induced DNA damage also led
to p53-dependent PCBP4 upregulation. By generating cell lines that
inducibly expressed either wildtype or mutated forms of the 2 PCBP4
splice variants, Zhu and Chen (2000) found that both variants suppressed
cell proliferation by inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in
G(2)-M. Through their KH domains, both variants bound poly(rC) and their
RNA-binding activity was necessary to induce apoptosis and cell cycle
arrest.

GENE STRUCTURE

Zhu and Chen (2000) identified 3 potential p53-binding sites in the
untranslated region upstream of the PCBP4 transcription start site.
Makeyev and Liebhaber (2000) determined that the PCBP4 gene contains 14
exons and spans 9.8 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Zhu and Chen (2000) and Makeyev and
Liebhaber (2000) mapped the PCBP4 gene to chromosome 3p21. By FISH,
Makeyev and Liebhaber (2000) mapped the mouse Pcbp4 gene to a syntenic
region of mouse chromosome 9F1-F2.

;;SECRETED LY6/PLAUR DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 2; SLURP2;;
SECRETED LY6/UPAR-RELATED PROTEIN 2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The LYNX1 gene encodes a protein that shares characteristics with toxins
that bind and inhibit nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR; see,
e.g., CHRNA1, 100690) (Miwa et al., 1999). Components of snake venoms
often have structural and functional mammalian homologs. For example,
hemolytic snake venom toxins are related to cellular phospholipases
(e.g., PLA2G1B; 172410), and snake sarafotoxins may be related to
vertebrate endothelins (e.g., EDN1; 131240). The elapid venom
alpha-bungarotoxin also binds to and inhibits nAChR.

CLONING

By screening for central nervous system-specific, developmentally
regulated cDNAs in mouse, Miwa et al. (1999) identified a cDNA encoding
GC26, which was expressed in mouse cerebellum. Sequence analysis
predicted that the 116-amino acid protein contains a signal sequence at
its N terminus, a cysteine-rich consensus motif characteristic of LY6
family proteins (e.g., CD59; 107271) and snake alpha-neurotoxins, and an
asparagine/GPI anchor motif at its C terminus. The overall structure of
GC26 is similar to that of LY6 family proteins and snake
alpha-neurotoxins, and Miwa et al. (1999) redesignated the protein
'Ly6/neurotoxin-1,' or Lynx1. A partial sequence encoding a human Lynx1
homolog has been identified (GenBank GENBANK AF321824). Northern blot
analysis revealed predominant expression of Lynx1 in mouse brain. In
situ hybridization analysis showed Lynx1 expression in neurons in
multiple brain structures. Immunocytochemistry demonstrated expression
of Lynx1 in neuronal soma and proximal dendrites.

Using microarray analysis to identify ESTs expressed predominantly in
the skin of patients with psoriasis vulgaris (see 177900), followed by
PCR and RACE of cultured keratinocyte cDNA libraries, Tsuji et al.
(2003) cloned LYNX1, which they called SLURP2. The deduced 97-amino acid
protein contains a signal peptide and 10 conserved cysteine residues
with a spacing pattern characteristic of the LY6 superfamily, but it
does not have the GPI anchor or transmembrane domains found in
membrane-bound LY6 proteins. Northern blot analysis detected a 0.6-kb
transcript in esophagus and a 1.6-kb transcript in stomach and duodenum.
No expression was detected in other tissues examined, including skin.
RT-PCR detected abundant LYNX1 expression in cervix and esophagus, with
lower expression in adult and fetal skin and keratinocytes. Weak
expression was detected in brain, lung, stomach, small intestine, colon,
rectum, uterus, and thymus. No expression was detected in spleen and
bone marrow. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis detected a 3.8- to
2.8-fold increase in LYNX1 expression in lesional skin from 5 psoriasis
patients compared with nonlesional skin or normal skin.

GENE FUNCTION

Functional analysis by Miwa et al. (1999) indicated that Lynx1 is not a
ligand or neurotransmitter but has the capacity to enhance nicotinic
acetylcholine receptor function in the presence of acetylcholine.

Morishita et al. (2010) identified an increase in expression of Lynx1
protein in mice that prevented plasticity in the primary visual cortex
late in life. Removal of this molecular brake enhanced nicotinic
acetylcholine receptor signaling. Lynx1 expression thus maintains
stability of mature cortical networks in the presence of cholinergic
innervation. Morishita et al. (2010) concluded that modulating the
balance between excitatory and inhibitory circuits reactivates visual
plasticity.

GENE STRUCTURE

Tsuji et al. (2003) determined that the LYNX1 gene contains 3 exons and
spans about 5.6 kb. The promoter region contains 3 Sp1 (189906)- and 2
AP1 (165160)-binding sites, as well as single sites for E2F (189971) and
GATA3 (131320). It lacks TATA and CAAT consensus sequences. There are 2
major transcriptional initiation sites.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Tsuji et al. (2003) mapped the LYNX1 gene
to chromosome 8q24.3. Southern blot analysis indicated that LYNX1 is a
single-copy gene.

EVOLUTION

Human evolution is characterized by a dramatic increase in brain size
and complexity. To probe its genetic basis, Dorus et al. (2004) examined
the evolution of genes involved in diverse aspects of nervous system
biology. These genes, including LYNX1, displayed significantly higher
rates of protein evolution in primates than in rodents. This trend was
most pronounced for the subset of genes implicated in nervous system
development. Moreover, within primates, the acceleration of protein
evolution was most prominent in the lineage leading from ancestral
primates to humans. Dorus et al. (2004) concluded that the phenotypic
evolution of the human nervous system has a salient molecular correlate,
i.e., accelerated evolution of the underlying genes, particularly those
linked to nervous system development.

ANIMAL MODEL

Miwa et al. (2006) found that Lynx1 -/- mice showed no gross
abnormalities in size, viability, CNS morphology, or longevity compared
to wildtype mice. However, Lynx1-null mice showed increased learning and
memory in a fear-conditioned paradigm and displayed increased
sensitivity to nicotine in motor tasks compared to wildtype. Neurons
from Lynx1-null mice showed heightened sensitivity and increased
intracellular calcium levels in response to nicotine. Loss of Lynx1
decreased receptor desensitization and enhanced synaptic efficacy.
Mutant neurons were also more sensitive to excitotoxic insult, and Lynx1
mutant mice exhibited age-dependent degeneration that was exacerbated by
nicotine and rescued by null mutations in nAChR subunits. These data
supported the hypotheses that Lynx1 normally decreases activity of
nAChRs and that deletion of Lynx1 shifts the balance in favor of
increased neuronal activity and synaptic plasticity. But the short-term
benefits of the loss of Lynx1 were counterbalanced by an increased
vulnerability of Lynx1 mutant neurons to glutamate toxicity and by loss
of nicotine's neuroprotective effect on these cells. Miwa et al. (2006)
concluded that Lynx1 modulates nAChR function to maintain low
sensitivity and plays a critical role in maintaining a balance between
the beneficial effects of short-term nAChR activation and the
degenerative effects of chronic receptor activation.

300822	TITLE *300822 OPSIN 1, LONG-WAVE-SENSITIVE; OPN1LW
;;RED CONE PIGMENT; RCP
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The long-wave-sensitive opsin-1 gene (OPN1LW) encodes red cone pigment,
1 of 3 light-sensitive pigments that mediate human color vision. The
red-sensitive and green-sensitive (OPN1MW; 300821) opsins comprise a
family of repeated genes on the X chromosome. Whereas there is a single
red pigment gene, green pigment genes vary in number among persons with
normal color vision. The red pigment gene and the multiple green pigment
genes are arranged in a head-to-tail tandem array. The maximal
sensitivity of red cones is 560 nm (Nathans et al., 1986, 1986).

A master switch for the genes of this locus, called the locus control
region (LCR; 300824), is located between 3.1 kb and 3.7 kb 5-prime of
the gene array and has been shown to be essential for expression of both
the red and green pigment genes as well as cone-specific expression of
the genes and their segregated expression in separate cones (summary by
Deeb, 2005).

CLONING

Nathans et al. (1986) isolated and sequenced genomic and cDNA clones
that encode each of the 3 visual pigments. The deduced amino acid
sequences show 41% identity with rhodopsin (180380). The red and green
pigments show 96% mutual identity, but only 43% identity with the blue
pigment (613522). In determining which of the 3 opsin genes corresponded
to each of the 3 cone pigments, Nathans et al. (1986) used the fact that
2 are X-linked and 1 is autosomal. The autosomal one was clearly the
blue cone pigment which is defective in tritan colorblindness (190900);
which of the other genes was for the red pigment and which for the green
was resolved by study of males with red (protan) or green (deutan)
colorblindness.

GENE STRUCTURE

Nathans et al. (1986) determined that the OPN1LW gene contains 6 exons.

MAPPING

Nathans et al. (1986) mapped the OPN1LW and OPN1MW genes to the distal
part of Xq, tightly linked to each other and to the G6PD gene (305900).

GENE FUNCTION

Visual pigments consist of an apoprotein, opsin, covalently linked to a
small, conjugated chromophore, 11-cis retinal, or in some cases 11-cis
dehydroretinal. Photon absorption by the visual pigments initiates
visual excitation by causing an 11-cis to all-trans isomerization of the
chromophore. Variation in absorption spectra of different visual
pigments is thought to arise from differences in the primary structure
of the apoprotein. Specifically, the visual pigments of the 3 types of
cones that mediate color vision are thought to differ in their
absorption spectra as a result of attachment of 11-cis retinal to 3
structurally distinct cone opsins. A corollary of the hypothesis is that
colorblindness arises from alterations in the genes encoding the cone
opsins. Most humans can match any color by mixing 3 primary colors: red,
green, and blue. Thomas Young (1802) hypothesized that this phenomenon
(trichromacy) is the consequence of humans having 3 independent
light-sensitive mechanisms. It is now known that Young's 3 mechanisms
are embodied in 3 classes of cone photoreceptor cells in the retina.
Each class contains a different visual pigment, which determines the
spectral sensitivity of all the cones of that class. The maximal
sensitivity of red, green, and blue cones is 560 nm, 530 nm, and 420 nm,
respectively (Nathans et al., 1986, 1986; Deeb, 2005).

Light exposure can induce suppression and/or circadian phase shift of
plasma melatonin levels in subjects with normal color vision. To
determine if normal cone photoreceptor systems are necessary for
light-induced melatonin suppression, Ruberg et al. (1996) tested whether
color vision-deficient humans also have light-induced melatonin
suppression. In 1 study, 14 red-green color vision-deficient subjects
and 7 normal controls were exposed to a 90-min, 200-lux, white light
stimulus from 0200-0330 h. Melatonin suppression was observed in
controls (t = -7.04; P less than 0.001), all color vision-deficient
subjects (t = -4.76; P less than 0.001), protanopic observers (t =
-6.23; P less than 0.005), and deuteranopic observers (t = -3.48; P less
than 0.05), with no significant difference in the magnitude of
suppression between groups. These findings suggested that a normal
trichromatic visual system is not necessary for light-mediated
neuroendocrine regulation.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Nathans et al. (1986) determined that whereas there is a single red
pigment gene, green pigment genes vary in number among persons with
normal color vision. The red pigment gene and the multiple green pigment
genes are arranged in a head-to-tail tandem array, with the red pigment
gene at the 5-prime end. Nathans et al. (1986) suggested that
nonhomologous pairing and unequal crossing-over can explain the
development of protan (red; 303800) and deutan (green; 303900)
colorblindness. Gene conversion may also be involved.

Although there are 15 amino acid differences between the MW (green) and
LW (red) opsins, the greater part of the spectral shift in sensitivity
is the result of substitutions at sites 180, 277, and 285, with 5 other
sites having smaller effects. Site 180 (see 300822.0002) is polymorphic
in both MW and LW opsin genes. The middlewave opsin is missing or
defective in deuteranopia and the longwave opsin in protanopia. Using
refined methods, Neitz and Neitz (1995) reexamined the numbers and
ratios of genes in the Xq28 cluster in men with normal color vision.
Results indicated that many men have more pigment genes on the X
chromosome than had previously been suggested and that many have more
than 1 longwave pigment gene.

In a study of 33 unrelated subjects with blue cone monochromacy
(303700), Nathans et al. (1993) found one subject with a single red
pigment gene carrying an arg247-to-ter mutation (300822.0001). In
another subject, they identified a cys203-to-arg mutation in both the
red pigment (300822.0003) and the green pigment (300821.0002) genes. In
addition, in 14 unrelated BCM probands, Nathans et al. (1993) identified
a single 5-prime red, 3-prime green hybrid gene carrying the C203R
mutation.

In a Danish family with BCM, Ladekjaer-Mikkelsen et al. (1996)
identified an isolated red pigment gene with deletion of exon 4
(300822.0005). The authors stated that this was the first intragenic
deletion reported among the red and green pigment genes and that it
represented a new mechanism underlying the development of BCM.

Ueyama et al. (2002) analyzed DNA in 217 Japanese males with congenital
red/green color vision deficiencies. The normal genotype of a single red
gene, followed by a green gene, was found in 23 subjects. Four of the 23
were from the 69 protan subject groups and 19 of the 23 were from the
148 deutan subject group. Three of the 23 subjects had missense
mutations: asn94-to-lys (300821.0003) in the single green gene of a
deutan subject; arg330-to-gln (300821.0004) in both green genes of
another deutan subject; and gly338-to-glu (300822.0004) in the single
red gene of a protan subject. Both normal and mutant opsins were
expressed in cultured COS-7 cells and visual pigments were regenerated
with 11-cis-retinal. The mutations resulted in no absorbance or a low
absorbance spectrum. Therefore, these 3 mutant opsins probably affected
the folding process, resulting in a loss of function as a visual
pigment.

In a British family segregating X-linked recessive BCM, Michaelides et
al. (2005) identified a single hybrid 5-prime-L/M-3-prime gene
containing the C203R substitution in exon 4 (see 300822.0003).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
BLUE CONE MONOCHROMACY
OPN1LW, ARG247TER

In the male proband from a 4-generation BCM family with 3 affected
individuals, who had been previously studied by Reitner et al. (1991)
(patient 'MP'), Nathans et al. (1993) identified a single red pigment
gene carrying a C-T transition in exon 4, resulting in an arg247-to-ter
(R247X) substitution.

.0002
RED CONE POLYMORPHISM
OPN1LW, SER180ALA

Genetic variation of human senses within the normal range probably
exists but usually cannot be investigated in detail for lack of
appropriate methods. Subtle perceptual differences in red-green vision
can be studied, however, since both photo-pigment genotypes and
psychophysical phenotypes can be assessed by sophisticated techniques.
Color matches of males with normal color vision fall into 2 main groups
that appear to be transmitted by X-linked inheritance. This difference
in color matching is likely to reflect small variations in the
absorption maxima of visual pigments, suggesting the presence of 2
common variants of the red and/or green visual pigments that differ in
spectral positioning. Winderickx et al. (1992) reported a common single
amino acid polymorphism (62% ser, 38% ala) at residue 180 of the RCP
gene, explaining the finding of 2 major groups in the distribution of
color matching among males with normal color vision.

.0003
BLUE CONE MONOCHROMACY
OPN1LW AND OPN1MW, CYS203ARG

In the male proband from a 3-generation family with 8 individuals with
blue cone monochromacy (303700), Nathans et al. (1993) identified a
cys203-to-arg (C203R) mutation in both the RCP and the GCP (300821.0002)
genes. In addition, in 14 unrelated BCM probands, Nathans et al. (1993)
identified a single 5-prime red, 3-prime green hybrid gene carrying the
C203R mutation.

Reyniers et al. (1995) described a family with BCM due to the presence
of a C203R mutation in both RCP and GCP. The flanking sequences of the
C203R mutation in exon 4 of RCP were characteristic for GCP, indicating
that this mutation was transferred from GCP into RCP by gene conversion.

In a British family segregating X-linked recessive BCM, Michaelides et
al. (2005) identified a single hybrid 5-prime-L/M-3-prime gene, which
was the result of recombination within intron 4, with a C203R
substitution in exon 4.

.0004
COLORBLINDNESS, PROTAN
RCP, GLY338GLU

In a person with protan colorblindness (303900), Ueyama et al. (2002)
found a gly338-to-glu (GGG to GAG; G338E) mutation in the single red
pigment gene. The mutant opsin showed no absorbance.

.0005
BLUE CONE MONOCHROMACY
OPN1LW, EX2DEL

In the proband of a Danish family with blue cone monochromacy (303700),
Ladekjaer-Mikkelsen et al. (1996) identified a single red pigment gene
in which exon 4 had been deleted. The same deletion was found in a
maternal half-brother with BCM and their unaffected carrier mother,
whereas the deletion was not found in a brother with normal color
vision. The deletion was predicted to generate a premature stop codon,
resulting in a protein that lacks the final 3 of 7 transmembrane
alpha-helices, including the lysine at codon 312 where 11-cis retinal
covalently attaches to normal pigment.

;;PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE, MAGNESIUM-DEPENDENT, 1, GAMMA ISOFORM;;
PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE 2C, GAMMA ISOFORM; PP2CG;;
PP2C-GAMMA
DESCRIPTION Protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation are key regulatory
mechanisms in many cellular processes. Four major classes of
serine/threonine protein phosphatases have been described: PP1, PP2A,
PP2B, and PP2C. These proteins differ in their substrate specificity,
divalent cation requirements, and sensitivity to inhibitors. PP1, PP2A,
and PP2B phosphatases have catalytic subunits with significant sequence
similarity, and regulatory subunits which are believed to regulate
activity or cellular localization. In contrast, PP2C phosphatases are
monomeric and have amino acid sequences that are distinct from those of
the other phosphatases. By searching an EST database using the amino
acid sequence of PP2C-alpha (PPM1A; 606108) as the query, Travis and
Welsh (1997) identified PPM1G, which they called PP2C-gamma. They
isolated a human skeletal muscle cDNA containing a complete PPM1G coding
sequence. The deduced 546-amino acid PPM1G protein contains the highly
conserved signature sequences of PP2C phosphatases, suggesting that it
is a member of the PP2C family. However, PPM1G shares only 34% amino
acid sequence identity with human PP2C-alpha. A distinctive feature of
PPM1G is the presence of a large acidic domain. PPM1G also contains
putative PEST sequences, numerous potential sites for phosphorylation,
and a possible myristylation site. Travis and Welsh (1997) demonstrated
that recombinant PPM1G expressed in bacteria requires magnesium or
manganese for activity, and is inhibited by fluoride but not okadaic
acid or vanadate. Northern blot analysis detected an approximately
2.3-kb PPM1G transcript in all human tissues examined, with the highest
levels in testis, skeletal muscle, and heart.

Dephosphorylation of splicing factors may be important for catalysis
after spliceosome assembly. To identify activities involved in human
pre-mRNA splicing, Murray et al. (1999) separated HeLa cell nuclear
extract into 5 complementing fractions. They purified an activity that
they called 'splicing-complementing factor-1' (SCF1) from 1 of these
fractions by assaying for reconstitution of splicing in the presence of
the remaining 4 fractions. Murray et al. (1999) showed that a component
of SCF1 is PPM1G. They demonstrated that human PPM1G is physically
associated with the spliceosome in vitro throughout the splicing
reaction, but is first required during the early stages of spliceosome
assembly for efficient formation of the A complex. The phosphatase
activity is required for the splicing function of PPM1G, as an active
site mutant does not support spliceosome activity. The requirement for
PPM1G is highly specific, as the closely related phosphatase PP2C-alpha
cannot substitute for PPM1G. Consistent with a role in splicing, PPM1G
localizes to the nucleus in vivo. Murray et al. (1999) concluded that at
least 1 specific dephosphorylation event catalyzed by PPM1G is required
for formation of the spliceosome.
