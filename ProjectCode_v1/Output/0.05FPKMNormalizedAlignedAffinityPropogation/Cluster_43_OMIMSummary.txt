DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Pragnell et al. (1991) isolated a cDNA clone encoding a protein with
high homology to the beta subunit of the rabbit skeletal muscle
dihydropyridine-sensitive calcium channel from a rat brain cDNA library.
This rat brain beta-subunit cDNA hybridized to a 3.4-kb message that was
expressed in high levels in the cerebral hemispheres and hippocampus and
much lower levels in cerebellum. The open reading frame encodes 597
amino acids with a predicted mass of 65,679 Da which is 82% homologous
with the skeletal muscle beta subunit. Pragnell et al. (1991) suggested
that the encoded brain beta subunit, which has a primary structure
highly similar to its isoform in skeletal muscle, may have a comparable
role as an integral regulatory component of a neuronal calcium channel.

Powers et al. (1992) demonstrated that the skeletal muscle and brain
isoforms of the beta subunit are encoded by a single gene. The human
skeletal muscle beta-1 cDNA encodes a protein of 523 amino acids that is
97% identical to the rabbit skeletal muscle beta subunit. Two different
cDNAs were obtained from the human hippocampus library. One encodes a
protein of 478 amino acids that is identical to the skeletal muscle beta
subunit except for an internal region of 52 amino acids. The other
encodes a protein of 596 amino acids, which is identical to the
478-amino acid skeletal muscle beta subunit at amino acids 1-444;
however, it had a unique 152-amino acid C terminus. All 3 cDNAs
represented transcripts encoded by a single gene.

MAPPING

Pragnell et al. (1991) localized the human dihydropyridine-sensitive
calcium channel beta-subunit (CACNB1) gene to chromosome 1 by analysis
of somatic cell hybrids.

Iles et al. (1993) mapped the CACNLB1 gene to 17q11.2-q24, approximately
16 cM centromeric to HOX2B (142961). For this purpose, they used a
highly polymorphic dinucleotide repeat found close to the gene in
linkage analysis. At the same time, they excluded the CACNLB1 gene as
the site of the mutation in malignant hyperthermia (see 145600) families
that do not show linkage to chromosome 19q13.1 markers.

ANIMAL MODEL

To determine the role of the beta-1 subunit in channel activity and
excitation-contraction coupling, Gregg et al. (1996) used gene targeting
to inactivate the beta-1 subunit in mice. Homozygous mutant fetuses had
a phenotype very similar to that seen in mice with mutations in either
the alpha-1S subunit ('muscular dysgenic') or in the ryanodine
receptor-1 (180901), 'skrr.' All 3 mutants lacked excitation-contraction
coupling. Beta-1-null mice died at birth from asphyxia. Electrical
stimulation of beta-1-muscle failed to induce twitches; however,
contractures were induced by caffeine. In isolated beta-1-null myotubes,
action potentials were normal but failed to elicit calcium ion
transient. Immunohistochemistry of cultured myotubes showed that not
only was the beta-1 subunit absent, but the amount of alpha-1S in the
membrane was also undetectable. In contrast, the beta-1 subunit was
appropriately localized in alpha-1S-null cells. Therefore, Gregg et al.
(1996) concluded that the beta-1 subunit may not only play an important
role in the transport/insertion of the alpha-1S subunit into the
membrane, but may also be vital for the targeting of the muscle
dihydropyridine receptor complex to the transverse tubule/sarcoplasmic
reticulum junction.

604407	TITLE *604407 LEUCINE ZIPPER/EF-HAND-CONTAINING TRANSMEMBRANE PROTEIN 1; LETM1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Endele et al. (1999) isolated LETM1 cDNA clones from human craniofacial,
amniocyte, and normalized infant brain cDNA libraries. The deduced
739-amino acid protein is 83.8% identical to mouse Letm1 and contains 2
EF-hand calcium-binding sites, a transmembrane domain, a leucine zipper
motif, several coiled-coil domains, and phosphorylation sites. Northern
blot analysis showed that LETM1 was expressed in all adult and fetal
human tissues tested. The authors identified 4 different transcript
sizes, possibly resulting from alternative polyadenylation. RNA in situ
hybridization showed that Letm1 expression was ubiquitous in mouse
embryo sections at day 13.5.

Schlickum et al. (2004) determined that rat Letm1 localized to
mitochondria of transfected human embryonic kidney cells. Deletion of an
N-terminal domain containing a mitochondria targeting signal resulted in
diffuse cytoplasmic staining.

GENE STRUCTURE

By PCR using genomic DNA from PAC clones, Endele et al. (1999)
determined the genomic structure of the LETM1 gene. The gene contains 14
exons.

MAPPING

Endele et al. (1999) mapped the LETM1 gene to chromosome 4p16.3 by FISH.

GENE FUNCTION

Dimmer et al. (2008) found that human LETM1 localized to the inner
mitochondrial membrane, was exposed to the matrix, and oligomerized into
higher molecular mass complexes. Downregulation of LETM1 in HeLa cells
via RNA interference did not disrupt these complexes, but it led to
fragmentation of the mitochondrial network. Fragmentation was reversed
by nigericin, which catalyzes the electroneutral exchange of K+ against
H+. Downregulation of LETM1 caused necrosis-like death that was
independent of caspase (see CASP1; 147678) activation and refractory to
BCL2 (151430) overexpression. Fibroblasts from Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome
(WHS; 194190) patients, who are haploinsufficient for LETM1 due to
monoallelic deletion of part of chromosome 4p, showed normal
mitochondrial morphology.

Using a genomewide Drosophila RNAi screen, Jiang et al. (2009)
identified Letm1 as a regulator of mitochondrial Ca(2+) and H+
concentrations. RNA knockdown, overexpression, and liposome
reconstitution of purified Letm1 protein demonstrated that mammalian
Letm1 is a mitochondrial Ca(2+)/H+ antiporter.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Endele et al. (1999) reported that the LETM1 gene is deleted in nearly
all Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome patients and is located less than 80 kb
distal to the minimal WHS critical region.

ANIMAL MODEL

Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome (WHS; 194190) is a multigenic disorder
resulting from a hemizygous deletion on chromosome 4. LETM1 is a
candidate gene for seizures, a strong haploinsufficiency phenotype of
WHS patients. McQuibban et al. (2010) identified the Drosophila gene
CG4589 as the ortholog of LETM1 and renamed it DmLETM1. They assayed the
effects of downregulating the DmLETM1 gene on mitochondrial function in
vivo and in vitro. Conditional inactivation of DmLETM1 function in
specific tissues resulted in roughening of the adult eye, mitochondrial
swelling, and developmental lethality in third-instar larvae, possibly
the result of deregulated mitophagy. Neuronal-specific downregulation of
DmLETM1 resulted in impairment of locomotor behavior in the fly and
reduced synaptic neurotransmitter release. DmLETM1 complemented growth
and mitochondrial K+/H+ exchange (KHE) activity in yeast deficient for
LETM1. The authors proposed that DmLETM1 functions as a mitochondrial
osmoregulator through its mitochondrial K+/H+ exchange activity and may
explain part of the pathophysiologic WHS phenotype.

DESCRIPTION The CNGB1 and CNGA1 (123825) gene products form the heterotetrameric rod
photoreceptor cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channel, which conducts a
cation current in response to changes in intracellular levels of cGMP
and mediates the electrical response to light (summary by Kondo et al.,
2004).

CLONING

The human and bovine rod photoreceptor cGMP-gated cation channel
consists of 2 subunits: alpha (63 kD, CNGA1) and beta (240 kD). Ardell
et al. (1996) provided evidence that the human GAR1 protein is encoded
by the N-terminal region of the gene encoding the beta subunit of the
cGMP-gated photoreceptor channel.

Sugimoto et al. (1991) identified a unique glutamic acid-rich protein in
bovine rod photoreceptors. Chen et al. (1994) suggested that this
protein is a third subunit (gamma) of the rod cGMP-gated cation channel.
Ardell et al. (1995) characterized the CNCG3L gene (also referred to by
them as GAR1) that encodes a human homolog of the bovine gamma subunit.
Sequence analysis of cDNA clones encoding human CNCG3L revealed an open
reading frame predicting a protein of 299 amino acids (approximately 32
kD), half the size of the bovine gamma subunit. Within the first 31
amino acids, they found 90% identity between the human and bovine
sequences, and only 60% homology was found throughout the remainder of
the protein sequence. As in bovine gamma, the predicted isoelectric
point of the human protein is very acidic despite the absence of the
bovine C-terminal glutamic acid-rich domain.

Ardell et al. (1996) presented the complete sequence of the human beta
subunit and stated that the GAR1 gene previously reported by Ardell et
al. (1995) encodes the beta subunit N-terminal region. Using PCR, RNA
blot, and genomic DNA analysis, Ardell et al. (1996) provided evidence
that the beta subunit is produced from a locus on chromosome 16
consisting of 2 nonoverlapping transcription units that is capable of
generating independent transcripts corresponding to GAR1 and the
C-terminal two-thirds of the beta subunit. They showed that the
CNCG-beta subunit mRNA encodes the first 291 amino acids of human GAR1,
337 amino acids present only in the beta subunit, and the entire 623
amino acids predicted from the 2a cDNA sequence reported by Chen et al.
(1993).

GENE STRUCTURE

Ardell et al. (1995) demonstrated that the protein coding region of the
human CNGB1 gene consists of 12 exons spanning approximately 11 kb with
sequence identical to that of the cDNA clones.

GENE FUNCTION

Korschen et al. (1999) identified glutamic acid-rich proteins (GARPs) as
multivalent proteins that interact with the key players of cGMP
signaling, phosphodiesterase (see 602676) and guanylate cyclase (see
600179), and with the retina-specific ATP-binding cassette transporter
(ABCR; 601691), through 4 short repetitive sequences. In electron
micrographs, GARPs are restricted to the rim region and incisures of
discs in close proximity to the guanylate cyclase and ABCR, whereas the
phosphodiesterase is randomly distributed. GARP2 associates more
strongly with light-activated than with inactive phosphodiesterase, and
GARP2 potently inhibits phosphodiesterase activity. Korschen et al.
(1999) concluded that the GARPs organize a dynamic protein complex near
the disc rim that may control cGMP turnover and possibly other
light-dependent processes.

Kizhatil et al. (2009) found that targeting of cyclic nucleotide-gated
(CNG) channels to the rod outer segment required their interaction with
ankyrin-G (600465). Ankyrin-G localized exclusively to rod outer
segments, coimmunoprecipitated with the CNG channel, and bound to the
C-terminal domain of the channel beta-1 subunit. Ankyrin-G depletion in
neonatal mouse retinas markedly reduced CNG channel expression.
Transgenic expression of CNG channel beta-subunit mutants in Xenopus
rods showed that ankyrin-G binding was necessary and sufficient for
targeting of the beta-1 subunit to outer segments. Thus, Kizhatil et al.
(2009) concluded that ankyrin-G is required for transport of CNG
channels to the plasma membrane of rod outer segments.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Zhong et al. (2002) reported the identification of a leucine zipper
homology domain named CLZ (carboxy-terminal leucine zipper) that is
present in the distal C terminus of CNG channel A subunits but is absent
from B subunits and mediates an inter-subunit interaction. With
crosslinking, nondenaturing gel electrophoresis, and analytical
centrifugation, this CLZ domain was found to mediate a trimeric
interaction. In addition, a mutant cone CNG channel A subunit with its
CLZ domain replaced by a generic trimeric leucine zipper produced
channels that behaved much like the wildtype, but less so if replaced by
a dimeric or tetrameric leucine zipper. This A-subunit-only, trimeric
interaction suggested that heteromeric CNG channels actually adopt a
3A:1B stoichiometry. Biochemical analysis of the purified bovine rod CNG
channel confirmed this conclusion. Zhong et al. (2002) concluded that
this revised stoichiometry provides a new foundation for understanding
the structure and function of the CNG channel family.

In Xenopus oocytes, Trudeau and Zagotta (2002) showed that CNGA1-RP, a
mutant form of the CNGA1 subunit which lacks the final 37 amino acids in
the C-terminal region (123825.0004), formed normally-expressed
functional homomeric channels similar to wildtype. In contrast,
coexpression of CNGA1-RP and wildtype CNGB1 resulted in heteromeric
channels that did not convey current and were not detectable at the
membrane surface, despite the presence of these subunit proteins within
the cell interior. Studies revealed a protein-protein interaction
between the C-terminal region of CGNA1, which is deleted in CNGA1-RP,
and an N-terminal region of CNGB1. In the absence of this interaction,
an exposed short N-terminal region in CNGB1 prevented membrane
expression of the heteromeric channel.

Zheng and Zagotta (2004) found that when cRNA for 3 rat olfactory CNG
channel subunits, Cnga2 (300338), Cnga4 (609472), and Cngb1b, a splice
variant of Cngb1, were coinjected into Xenopus oocytes, functional
channels in the surface membrane contained a fixed ratio of
Cnga2:Cnga4:Cngb1b of 2:1:1. When expressed individually with Cnga2, the
Cnga4 and Cngb1b subunits were present as single copies, and when
expressed alone, they did not self-assemble.

MAPPING

Ardell et al. (1995) demonstrated localization of the CNCG3L gene to
chromosome 16 by PCR of somatic cell hybrid DNA with primer pairs that
amplified a portion of the gene. The location of the gene was further
delimited by fluorescence in situ hybridization, which placed the gene
at 16q13. Ardell et al. (1996) localized the CNCG2 gene to chromosome
16q13 by somatic hybrid cell DNA analysis.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Bareil et al. (2001) studied a consanguineous French family with
autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (RP45; 613767). Bareil et al.
(2001) excluded linkage to known loci involved in RP and by homozygosity
mapping localized the disease gene in this family to 16q13-q21. They
noted 2 candidate genes, KIFC3 (604535) and CNGB1. Mutation analysis
demonstrated that CNGB1 was mutated in this family.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
RETINITIS PIGMENTOSA 45
CNGB1, GLY993VAL

In a consanguineous French family affected by autosomal recessive
retinitis pigmentosa (RP45; 613767) Bareil et al. (2001) found that
affected individuals were homozygous for a 2978G-T transversion in exon
30 of the CNGB1 gene, predicted to result in a gly993-to-val (G993V)
amino acid change in the protein. This mutation was not found in normal
samples or in other RP samples. Gly993 is a conserved residue; the
missense G993V change was predicted to change the cyclic
nucleotide-binding domain of the beta-subunit of the rod cGMP-gated
channel.

.0002
RETINITIS PIGMENTOSA 45
CNGB1, IVS32, G-A, +1

In a 67-year-old Japanese man who noticed night blindness at school age
and who had received the diagnosis of retinitis pigmentosa (RP45;
613767) at the age of 30, Kondo et al. (2004) found a novel homozygous
splice site mutation at the donor site of exon 32 of the CNGB1 gene
(3444+1G-A) that resulted in frameshift and truncation of the last 28
amino acids.

;;EPIDERMODYSPLASIA VERRUCIFORMIS GENE 1; EVER1; EV1
DESCRIPTION For phenotypic information on epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV), see
226400.

CLONING

Ramoz et al. (2002) positionally cloned the EVER1 gene from the EV1
locus on 17q25 (Ramoz et al., 1999). Computational analysis of the EV1
interval on the Human Genome Draft Sequence allowed construction of a
contig of partially sequenced overlapping BACs. The region contained the
genes encoding thymidine kinase-1 (TK1; 188300) and synaptogyrin-2
(SYNGR2; 603926) as well as the EV1 and EV2 genes, which were assigned
the symbols EVER1 and EVER2 (605829), respectively. The EVER1 gene
encodes 2 alternatively spliced proteins, one of 805 amino acids and the
other of 454 amino acids, in the same open reading frame. The EVER1
protein was predicted to contain 10 transmembrane domains and 2 leucine
zipper motifs. EVER1 shares approximately 75% amino acid identity with a
mouse homolog, and EVER1 and EVER2 share approximately 28% of their
constituent amino acids. EVER1 and EVER2 are expressed in the cytoplasm
and colocalize with calnexin (114217), an integral membrane protein
located in the endoplasmic reticulum.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ramoz et al. (2002) determined that the EVER1 gene contains 20 exons.
The EVER1 and EVER2 genes are in opposite orientation from the first
in-frame ATG start codon and are separated by 4,732 bp.

MAPPING

Ramoz et al. (1999) mapped a susceptibility locus for epidermodysplasia
verruciformis (226400) to chromosome 17qter (EV1), within the 1-cM
interval between markers D17S939 and D17S802 in 3 consanguineous
families. Ramoz et al. (2000) performed genotyping for 10 microsatellite
markers spanning 29 cM around EV1 in 2 additional consanguineous
epidermodysplasia verruciformis families. Using homozygosity mapping,
linkage with 17qter markers was observed in 1 family, and multipoint
linkage analysis yielded maximum multipoint lod score values above 10
between markers D17S1839 and D17S802, encompassing the EV1 locus.

Ramoz et al. (2002) narrowed the EV1 interval to about 180 kb on 17q25
and cloned the EVER1 gene from this region.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Ramoz et al. (2002) studied 2 Algerian and 2 Colombian consanguineous
families who had been previously described (Ramoz et al., 1999; Ramoz et
al., 2000) and an additional EV1-linked Algerian family in which an
individual was affected with HPV5. In 2 Algerian families and in 1
Colombian family, Ramoz et al. (2002) found that epidermodysplasia
verruciformis was associated with homozygosity for separate nonsense
mutations of the EVER1 gene. They also found 2 mutations in the EVER2
gene.

In a Japanese woman with epidermodysplasia verruciformis, Tate et al.
(2004) identified compound heterozygosity for mutations in the EVER1
gene (605828.0003-605828.0004).

In 2 consanguineous Algerian families, Ramoz et al. (2002) found that
epidermodysplasia verruciformis (226400) was associated with
homozygosity for a C-to-T transition of nucleotide 280 in the TMC6 cDNA,
predicted to cause a nonsense change, arg94 to ter (R94X). Affected
individuals in the 2 families shared the same haplotype markers in
homozygosity, suggesting a common ancestral mutation.

EPIDERMODYSPLASIA VERRUCIFORMIS
TMC6, GLU576TER

In a consanguineous Colombian family, Ramoz et al. (2002) found that
epidermodysplasia verruciformis (226400) was associated with
homozygosity for a 1726G-T transversion in the TMC6 gene, resulting in a
glu576-to-ter (E576X) mutation.

In a 65-year-old Japanese woman with epidermodysplasia verruciformis
(226400), Tate et al. (2004) found compound heterozygosity for mutations
in the TMC6 gene: a 744C-A transversion in exon 8, resulting in a
tyr248-to-ter mutation (Y248X), and an IVS8AS-2A-T transversion
(605828.0004). The patient had suffered from warts beginning when she
was a teenager. Excision of Bowen disease from the skin of the hand was
carried out 3 times at the ages of 51, 52, and 64 years, and gastrectomy
was performed for gastric cancer when she was 53 years of age. Multiple
skin cancers of the face showed squamous cell carcinoma and Bowen
disease. The parents were unaffected and were not related. Three of 6
sibs were also affected.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are members of a
superfamily of ligand-gated ion channels that mediate fast signal
transmission at synapses. The nAChRs are thought to be (hetero)pentamers
composed of homologous subunits. See 118508 for additional background
information on nAChRs.

CLONING

Monteggia et al. (1995) obtained the full-length cDNA sequence for the
alpha-4 neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit. The predicted
amino acid sequence is 89% similar to the rat sequence, with most
differences in the cytoplasmic domain. Elliott et al. (1996) also cloned
the alpha-4 gene.

GENE STRUCTURE

Steinlein et al. (1996) determined that the CHRNA4 gene consists of 6
exons distributed over approximately 17 kb of genomic DNA.

MAPPING

By genomic Southern blot analysis of hamster/human somatic cell hybrid
DNAs, Anand and Lindstrom (1992) mapped the gene encoding the alpha-4
subunit of the human neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor to
chromosome 20. Pilz et al. (1992) likewise mapped the gene to human
chromosome 20 by Southern blot analysis of human/rodent somatic cell
hybrids. The corresponding gene is located on chromosome 2 in the mouse
(Bessis et al., 1990).

By fluorescent in situ hybridization, Steinlein et al. (1994) positioned
CHRNA4 on a contig between D20S24 and D20S20 on chromosome
20q13.2-q13.3. The 2 markers were separated by 160 kb. Steinlein et al.
(1994) suggested that the location of CHRNA4 made it a possible
candidate gene for either benign neonatal familial convulsions (EBN1;
121200) or the electroencephalographic variant pattern 1 (EEGV1;
130180).

GENE FUNCTION

Monteggia et al. (1995) found that transfection of expression vectors
for the alpha-4 and beta-2 (CHRNB2; 118507) nAChR subunits into HEK293
cells resulted in the formation of binding sites with the expected high
affinity for cytosine.

Elliott et al. (1996) demonstrated that human alpha-4 encodes a
functional receptor when expressed in combination with human beta-2 or
beta-4 (CHRNB4; 118509) in Xenopus oocytes.

By immunoprecipitation analysis of mouse striatal extracts, Champtiaux
et al. (2003) identified 3 main types of heteromeric nAChRs:
alpha-4/beta-2, alpha-6 (CHRNA6; 606888)/beta-2, and
alpha-4/alpha-6/beta-2. Alpha-6/beta-2 nAChRs were mainly located on
dopamine (DA) nerve terminals and were the direct target of
alpha-conotoxin MII inhibition. A combination of alpha-6/beta-2 and
alpha-4/beta-2 nAChRs mediated endogenous cholinergic modulation of DA
release induced by systemic nicotine administration at nerve terminals.
Alpha-4/beta-2 nAChRs appeared to represent the majority of nAChRs on DA
neuron soma and contributed to nicotine reinforcement.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Xiu et al. (2009) showed that at the brain acetylcholine receptors
alpha-4-beta-2 thought to underlie nicotine addiction, the high affinity
for nicotine is the result of a strong cation-pi interaction to a
specific aromatic amino acid of the receptor, TrpB. In contrast, the low
affinity for nicotine at the muscle-type acetylcholine receptor is
largely due to the absence of this key interaction, even though the
immediate binding site residues, including the key amino acid TrpB, are
identical in the brain and muscle receptors. At the same time a hydrogen
bond from nicotine to the backbone carbonyl of TrpB is enhanced in the
neuronal receptor relative to the muscle type. A point mutation near
TrpB that differentiates alpha-4-beta-2 and muscle-type receptors seems
to influence the shape of the binding site, allowing nicotine to
interact more strongly with TrpB in the neuronal receptor.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Autosomal Dominant Nocturnal Frontal Lobe Epilepsy

Steinlein et al. (1995) demonstrated a missense mutation in the CHRNA4
gene (118504.0002) associated with autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal
lobe epilepsy (600513), which had previously been mapped to 20q. The
mutation was sought because CHRNA4 maps to the candidate region of 20q
and the gene is expressed in all layers of the frontal cortex. Mutations
in the CHRNA4 gene appear to account for only a small proportion of the
cases of nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy.

- Associations with Other Disorders

Nicotine is the major addictive substance in cigarettes, and genes
involved in sensing nicotine are logical candidates for vulnerability to
nicotine addiction (188890). Feng et al. (2004) studied 6
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CHRNA4 gene and 4 SNPs in
the CHRNB2 gene (118507) in relation to nicotine dependence in a
collection of 901 subjects (815 sibs and 86 parents) from 222 nuclear
families with multiple nicotine-addicted sibs. They found 2 SNPs in exon
5 of the CHRNA4 gene to be significantly associated with a protective
effect against nicotine addiction. Furthermore, a common (22.5%) CHRNA4
haplotype was significantly associated with a protective effect against
nicotine addiction.

Li et al. (2005) analyzed 6 SNPs within CHRNA4 for association with
nicotine dependence (ND). In a sample of European American families,
SNPs dbSNP rs2273504 and dbSNP rs1044396 (118504.0005) were
significantly associated with the adjusted smoking quantity and
Fagerstrom test for ND score, respectively. In the African American
families, SNPs dbSNP rs3787137 and dbSNP rs2236196 were each
significantly associated with at least 2 adjusted ND measures. Haplotype
analysis of dbSNP rs2273505, dbSNP rs2273504, and dbSNP rs2236196 showed
significant association after Bonferroni correction of a C-G-G haplotype
(53.4%) with 3 adjusted ND measures in samples from the African American
females.

For a possible association between variation in the CHRNA4 gene and the
psychologic trait of harm avoidance, see 607834.

HISTORY

Benign familial neonatal seizures 1 (BFNS1; 121200) was shown to be
caused by mutations in the KCNQ2 gene (602235), which also maps to
chromosome 20q13 (Singh et al., 1998). The finding of a presumed
mutation (Beck et al., 1994) in the CHRNA4 gene, which maps to the same
region, in 1 of 20 families, was presumably an error.

ANIMAL MODEL

Marubio et al. (1999) disrupted the alpha-4 subunit of the neuronal
nicotinic acetylcholine receptor by homologous recombination and studied
homozygous alpha-4-null mice and mice lacking the beta-2 subunit of the
nAChR. The homozygous alpha-4 -/- mice no longer expressed high-affinity
nicotine binding sites throughout the brain. In addition, both types of
mutant mice displayed a reduced antinociceptive effect of nicotine on
the hot-plate test and diminished sensitivity to nicotine in the
tail-flick test. Patch-clamp recordings revealed that raphe magnus and
thalamic neurons no longer responded to nicotine. Marubio et al. (1999)
stated that the alpha-4 nAChR subunit, thought to associate with the
beta-2 nAChR subunit, is therefore crucial for nicotine-elicited
antinociception.

The electroconvulsive threshold (ECT) test has been used extensively to
determine the protection conferred by antiepileptic drug candidates
against induced seizures in rodents. Yang et al. (2003) adopted the ECT
test to screen the progeny of ethylnitrosourea-treated male C57BL/6J
mice. In a small-scale screen, several mutant lines conferring a low
threshold to ECT minimal clonic seizures were mapped to the telomeric
region of mouse chromosome 2 in independent founder families. Genetic
and physical mapping data indicated that several lines shared a single
mutation, Szt1 (seizure threshold-1), consisting of a 300-kb deletion of
genomic DNA involving 3 known genes. Two of these genes, Kcnq2 and
Chrna4, are known to be mutated in human epilepsy families. Szt1
homozygotes and heterozygotes displayed similar phenotypes to those
found in the respective Kcnq2 knockout mutant mice, suggesting that
Kcnq2 haploinsufficiency may lie at the root of the Szt1 seizure
sensitivity.

Tapper et al. (2004) generated mutant mice with alpha-4 nicotinic
subunits containing a single point mutation, leu9-prime to ala, in the
pore-forming M2 domain, rendering alpha-4 mutant receptors
hypersensitive to nicotine. Selective activation of alpha-4 mutant
nicotinic acetylcholine receptors with low doses of agonist
recapitulated nicotine effects thought to be important in dependence,
including reinforcement in response to acute nicotine administration, as
well as tolerance and sensitization elicited by chronic nicotine
administration. Tapper et al. (2004) concluded that activation of
alpha-4 mutant receptors is sufficient for nicotine-induced reward,
tolerance, and sensitization.

Klaassen et al. (2006) generated 2 mouse models of autosomal dominant
nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy by introducing an S252F (118504.0002)
mutation or a leu264 insertion in the Chrna4 gene, respectively. Mice
heterozygous for the S252F mutation or the leu264 insertion showed
abnormal cortical EEGs with prominent delta and theta frequencies,
frequent spontaneous seizures, and increased sensitivity to the
proconvulsant action of nicotine. Voltage-clamp studies showed that a
considerable fraction of mutant Chrna4-containing nAChRs were located on
presynaptic terminals of cortical GABAergic interneurons and that
activation of these receptors resulted in elevated presynaptic calcium
levels. The results were consistent with a model of epileptogenesis in
which acetylcholine significantly enhances cortical GABAergic
transmission, which contributes to epileptogenesis through inhibitory
resetting and synchronization of neural networks.

EPILEPSY, NOCTURNAL FRONTAL LOBE, TYPE 1
CHRNA4, SER252PHE

In affected members of a large Australian kindred with autosomal
dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (600513) reported by Phillips
et al. (1995), Steinlein et al. (1995) used single-strand conformation
analysis to identify a C-to-T transition in exon 5 of the CHRNA4 gene,
resulting in ser248-to-phe (SER248PHE) substitution in the sixth amino
acid position of transmembrane domain 2 (M2) and reduced receptor
function. Their numbering was based on the Torpedo californica Chrna4
sequence. Saenz et al. (1999) noted that in the human sequence codon 252
is homologous to the Torpedo codon 248, and they referred to the
mutation as ser252 to phe (S252F).

Forman et al. (1996) suggested an alternative mechanism for pathogenesis
of epilepsy associated with this CHRNA4 mutation. From studies of the
mouse muscle alpha-1 nicotinic receptor (100690) noted in Forman et al.
(1995), Forman et al. (1996) speculated that the mutation in CHRNA4 may
cause receptor hyperactivity that could lead to epileptic activity.

In 11 affected members of a large Spanish family with nocturnal frontal
lobe epilepsy, Saenz et al. (1999) identified the S252F mutation. Saenz
et al. (1999) noted that the clinical features were similar to those
reported by Steinlein et al. (1995). This same residue is affected in
the S252L mutation (118504.0004)

Using PET scans, Fedi et al. (2008) observed decreased striatal D1
receptor (DRD1; 126449) binding, particularly in the right putamen, in
12 ADNFLE individuals with the S252L mutation compared to controls.
Decreased D1 receptor binding was postulated to represent receptor
downregulation from increased extracellular levels of dopamine.
Increased dopamine release may result from a gain-of-function in nAChRs
with the mutant CHRNA4 subunit, since nAChRs regulate dopamine release.

.0003
EPILEPSY, NOCTURNAL FRONTAL LOBE, TYPE 1
CHRNA4, 3-BP INS, 776GCT

In a Norwegian family with autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe
epilepsy (600513), Steinlein et al. (1997) identified a 3-bp (GCT)
insertion at nucleotide position 776 into the region of the CHRNA4 gene
coding for the C-terminal end of the M2 domain. Physiologic
investigations of the receptor reconstituted with the mutated CHRNA4
subunit revealed that this insertion does not prevent the receptor
function but increases its apparent affinity for acetylcholine. In
addition, this mutant receptor showed a significantly lower calcium
permeability that, at the cellular level, may correspond to a loss of
function.

.0004
EPILEPSY, NOCTURNAL FRONTAL LOBE, TYPE 1
CHRNA4, SER252LEU

In a Japanese family with autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe
epilepsy (600513), Hirose et al. (1999) identified a 755C-T transition
in exon 5 of the CHRNA4 gene, causing a ser252-to-leu (S252L)
substitution. The mutation was not found in 200 alleles of healthy
volunteers. Based on analysis of the amino acid sequence, Hirose et al.
(1999) suggested that the serine-to-leucine change undermines the
channel function considerably.

In a Korean family in which 9 members in 3 generations were affected
with ADNFLE, Cho et al. (2003) identified the S252L mutation. Cho et al.
(2003) noted that the clinical phenotype in the Korean family was
similar to that reported by Hirose et al. (1999) in the Japanese family
with the same mutation. Shared features included mental retardation and
drug resistance.

This same residue is affected in the S252F mutation (118504.0002).

By haplotype analysis, Hwang et al. (2011) determined that the common
mutation identified by Hirose et al. (1999) and Cho et al. (2003), which
Hwang et al. (2011) referred to as ser284-to-leu (S284L), did not arise
from a common founder, but rather occurred independently. The mutation
was associated with a CpG hypermutable site.

NICOTINE ADDICTION, PROTECTION AGAINST
CHRNA4, EX5, C-T

Feng et al. (2004) found a single-nucleotide polymorphism in exon 5 of
the CHRNA4 gene, dbSNP rs1044396, to be significantly associated with a
protective effect against nicotine addiction (188890). The C-to-T
transition is synonymous (ser-ser). The variant T allele is the
protective allele.

.0006
NICOTINE ADDICTION, PROTECTION AGAINST
CHRNA4, EX5, G-A

Feng et al. (2004) found a single-nucleotide polymorphism in exon 5 of
the CHRNA4 gene, dbSNP rs1044397, to be significantly associated with a
protective effect against nicotine addiction (188890). The G-to-A
transition is synonymous (ala-ala). The variant A allele is the
protective allele.

300255	TITLE *300255 O-LINKED N-ACETYLGLUCOSAMINE TRANSFERASE; OGT
;;UDP-N-ACETYLGLUCOSAMINE:POLYPEPTIDE BETA-N-ACETYLGLUCOSAMINYL TRANSFERASE;;
GlcNAc TRANSFERASE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) transferase (OGT) catalyzes the
addition of a single N-acetylglucosamine in O-glycosidic linkage to
serine or threonine residues. Since both phosphorylation and
glycosylation compete for similar serine or threonine residues, the 2
processes may compete for sites, or they may alter the substrate
specificity of nearby sites by steric or electrostatic effects (Lubas et
al., 1997).

CLONING

Haltiwanger et al. (1992) purified rat liver OGT and determined that it
has a molecular mass of 340 kD. They proposed that OGT exists as a
heterotrimeric complex with 2 subunits of 110 kD and 1 of 78 kD.
However, using rabbit OGT, Lubas et al. (1997) analyzed the proteolytic
fingerprint of both polypeptides and found that the 2 are related. They
suggested that the 78-kD band is a proteolytic product of the 110-kD
polypeptide or the product of an alternative translation start site.
Kreppel et al. (1997) cloned rat cDNAs encoding the 110-kD subunit.
Immunofluorescence of human cells expressing rat OGT indicated that OGT
is present in both the nucleus and cytosol.

By searching an EST database with the partial protein sequence of rabbit
OGT, Lubas et al. (1997) identified human and C. elegans OGT cDNAs. The
predicted 920-amino acid human protein contains 9 tetratricopeptide
repeats and a putative bipartite nuclear localization signal. HeLa cells
expressing OGT did not survive well during prolonged incubations,
suggesting that this protein may be toxic to the cells. Southern blot
analysis indicated that a single OGT gene is present in humans. Northern
blot analysis revealed that OGT is expressed as multiple transcripts
that are present in different amounts in various human tissues, with the
highest levels of expression in pancreas.

GENE FUNCTION

Nuclear and cytoplasmic protein glycosylation is a widespread and
reversible posttranslational modification in eukaryotic cells.
Intracellular glycosylation by the addition of N-acetylglucosamine to
serine and threonine is catalyzed by OGT. This 'O-GlcNAcylation' of
intracellular proteins can occur on phosphorylation sites, and has been
implicated in controlling gene transcription, neurofilament assembly,
and the emergence of diabetes and neurologic disease. To study OGT
function in vivo, Shafi et al. (2000) used gene-targeting approaches in
male embryonic stem cells. They found that OGT mutagenesis requires a
strategy that retains an intact OGT gene as accomplished by using
Cre-loxP recombination, because a deletion of the OGT gene results in
loss of embryonic stem cell viability. OGT RNA expression in mice was
comparatively high among most cell types, with lower levels in the
pancreas. Segregation of OGT alleles in the mouse germline revealed that
intact OGT alleles are required for completion of embryogenesis. These
studies illustrated the necessity of conditional gene-targeting
approaches in the mutagenesis and study of essential X-linked genes, and
indicated that OGT participation in intracellular glycosylation is
essential for embryonic stem cell viability and for mouse ontogeny.

Transcription factors and RNA polymerase II can be modified by O-GlcNAc
monosaccharides at serine or threonine residues, yet the precise
functional roles of this modification are largely unknown. Yang et al.
(2002) showed that OGT, the enzyme that catalyzes this posttranslational
modification, interacts with a histone deacetylase complex by binding to
the corepressor Sin3A (607776). Functionally, OGT and Sin3A
cooperatively repress transcription in parallel with histone
deacetylation. The authors proposed that Sin3A targets OGT to promoters
to inactivate transcription factors and RNA polymerase II by O-GlcNAc
modification, which acts in concert with histone deacetylation to
promote gene silencing in an efficient and specific manner.

Zhang et al. (2003) demonstrated that the mammalian 26S proteasome could
be inhibited by Ogt-mediated modification, resulting in inhibited
proteolysis of the transcription factor Sp1 (189906) and a hydrophobic
test peptide. The Rpt2 ATPase in the proteasome 19S cap was modified by
O-GlcNAc in vitro and in vivo, and as its modification increased,
proteasome function decreased.

Yang et al. (2008) showed that OGT harbors a previously unrecognized
type of phosphoinositide-binding domain. After induction with insulin,
phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate recruits OGT from the nucleus to
the plasma membrane, where the enzyme catalyzes dynamic modification of
the insulin signaling pathway by O-GlcNAc. This results in the
alteration in phosphorylation of key signaling molecules and the
attenuation of insulin signal transduction. Hepatic overexpression of
OGT impairs the expression of insulin-responsive genes and causes
insulin resistance and dyslipidemia. Yang et al. (2008) concluded that
their findings identified a molecular mechanism by which nutritional
cues regulate insulin signaling through O-GlcNAc, and underscored the
contribution of this modification to the etiology of insulin resistance
and type 2 diabetes (125853).

Increases in the concentration of circulating glucose activate the
hexosamine biosynthetic pathway and promote the O-glycosylation of
proteins by OGT. Dentin et al. (2008) showed that OGT triggers hepatic
gluconeogenesis through the O-glycosylation of the transducer of
regulated cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) 2 (TORC2 or
CRTC2; 608972). CRTC2 was O-glycosylated at sites that normally
sequester CRTC2 in the cytoplasm through a phosphorylation-dependent
mechanism. Decreasing amounts of O-glycosylated CRTC2 by expression of
the deglycosylating enzyme O-GlcNAcase (604039) blocked effects of
glucose on gluconeogenesis, demonstrating the importance of the
hexosamine biosynthetic pathway in the development of glucose
intolerance.

Fujiki et al. (2011) reported that histone H2B (see 609904) is acylated
by O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAcylated) at residue S112 by OGT in
vitro and in living cells. Histone GlcNAcylation fluctuated in response
to extracellular glucose through the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway.
H2B S112 GlcNAcylation promotes K120 monoubiquitination, in which the
GlcNAc moiety can serve as an anchor for a histone H2B ubiquitin ligase.
H2B S112 GlcNAc was localized to euchromatic areas on fly polytene
chromosomes. In a genomewide analysis, H2B S112 GlcNAcylation sites were
observed widely distributed over chromosomes including transcribed gene
loci, with some sites colocalizing with H2B K120 monoubiquitination.
Fujiki et al. (2011) concluded that H2B S112 GlcNAcylation is a histone
modification that facilitates H2BK120 monoubiquitination, presumably for
transcriptional activation.

Using protein affinity purification, Chen et al. (2013) searched for
functional partners of TET proteins, and found that TET2 (612839) and
TET3 (613555) associates with OGT, an enzyme that by itself catalyzes
the addition of O-GlcNAc onto serine and threonine residues
(O-GlcNAcylation) in vivo. TET2 directly interacts with OGT, which is
important for the chromatin association of OGT in vivo. Although this
specific interaction does not regulate the enzymatic activity of TET2,
it facilitates OGT-dependent histone O-GlcNAcylation. Moreover, OGT
associates with TET2 at transcription start sites. Downregulation of
TET2 reduces the amount of histone 2B S112 GlcNAc marks in vivo, which
are associated with gene transcription regulation. Chen et al. (2013)
concluded that, taken together, their results revealed a TET2-dependent
O-GlcNAcylation of chromatin. The double epigenetic modifications on
both DNA and histones by TET2 and OGT coordinate for the regulation of
gene transcription.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Lazarus et al. (2011) reported 2 crystal structures of human OGT, as a
binary complex with UDP (2.8-angstrom resolution) and as a ternary
complex with UDP and a peptide substrate (1.95-angstrom resolution). The
structures provided clues to the enzyme mechanism, showed how OGT
recognizes target peptide sequences, and revealed the fold of the unique
domain between the 2 halves of the catalytic region.

MAPPING

Shafi et al. (2000) determined that a single copy of the OGT gene is
present in the male genome. By FISH, they mapped the human OGT gene to
Xq13, a region associated with neurologic diseases. By radiation hybrid
analysis, they mapped the mouse homolog to the X chromosome near the
centromere in region D.

603473	TITLE *603473 LARGE TUMOR SUPPRESSOR, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, 1; LATS1
DESCRIPTION In studies in Drosophila, Xu et al. (1995) used mosaic flies to screen
for tumor suppressors or negative regulators of cell proliferation. The
cellular composition of these flies resembled that of cancer patients
who are chimeric individuals carrying a small number of mutated somatic
cells. One of the genes they identified was the 'large tumor suppressor'
gene, lats (also known as wts), which encodes a putative
serine/threonine kinase. Somatic cells mutant for lats undergo extensive
proliferation and form large tumors in many tissues in mosaic adults.
Mutants homozygous for various lats alleles display a range of
developmental defects, including embryonic lethality. Although many
tumor suppressors were identified in Drosophila melanogaster, it was not
clear whether these fly genes were directly relevant to tumorigenesis in
mammals.

Tao et al. (1999) isolated mammalian homologs of Drosophila lats. Human
LATS1 and mouse Lats1 share 99% amino acid sequence identity in the
C-terminal kinase domain; human LATS1 and fly lats share 74% amino acid
sequence identity in this region. Northern blot analysis detected LATS1
expression in all fetal and adult tissues examined, with highest
expression in adult ovary. Human LATS1 suppressed tumor growth and
rescued all developmental defects, including embryonic lethality, in
flies. In mammalian cells, LATS1 was phosphorylated in a cell
cycle-dependent manner and complexed with CDC2 (116940) in early
mitosis. These and other biochemical observations indicated that LATS1
is a novel negative regulator of CDC2/cyclin A.

To elucidate further the function of mammalian LATS1, St. John et al.
(1999) generated Lats1 -/- mice. The homozygous deficient animals
exhibited a lack of mammary gland development, infertility, and growth
retardation. Accompanying these defects were hyperplastic changes in the
pituitary and decreased serum hormone levels. The reproductive hormone
defects of the homozygous deficient mice were reminiscent of isolated
LH-hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and corpus luteum insufficiency in
humans. Furthermore, the Lats1 -/- mice developed soft-tissue sarcomas
and ovarian stromal cell tumors and were highly sensitive to
carcinogenic treatments. The data demonstrated a role for LATS1 in
mammalian tumorigenesis and specific endocrine dysfunction. The
significance of the findings of Tao et al. (1999) and St. John et al.
(1999) were discussed by Kemp (1999).

600823	TITLE *600823 PROTEASE, SERINE, 8; PRSS8
;;PROSTASIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Human seminal fluid contains a variety of proteolytic enzymes, including
prostate-specific antigen (176820) and acrosin (102480). These enzymes
are involved in the postejaculatory hydrolysis of proteins and in semen
coagulation and liquefaction. Yu et al. (1995) obtained partial amino
acid sequence of a 40-kD protein isolated from seminal fluid originally
by Yu et al. (1994). Yu et al. (1995) designed degenerate primers based
on the amino acid sequence and used to screen a human prostate cDNA
library by PCR. The 3-prime end of the cDNA was obtained by the RACE
(rapid amplification of cDNA ends) method. A 1.8-kb cDNA sequence was
assembled encoding a predicted protein of 343 amino acids which contains
a 32-amino acid signal peptide. The protein, designated serine
protease-8 (PRSS8), was called prostasin by the authors. The precursor,
proprostasin, is cleaved between residues 12 and 13 to produce a
12-amino acid light chain and a 299-amino acid heavy chain which are
associated through a disulfide bond. The predicted amino acid sequence
is between 34 and 42% identical to human acrosin, plasma kallikrein
(229000), and hepsin (142440). The deduced protein has a hydrophobic
domain at the C terminus, indicating to the authors that it may be
membrane anchored. The authors showed that the hydrophobic region is
cleaved between residues 290 and 291 during secretion. Expression levels
of the prostasin mRNA were assayed by Southern blots of RT-PCR products.
Expression was noted in a wide variety of tissues. In the prostate
gland, expression was localized to the epithelial cells.

Donaldson et al. (2002) found evidence for the regulation of the
epithelial sodium channel (ENaC; see 600228) by prostasin. They cloned
prostasin in their search for a human homolog of a channel-activating
protease (xCAP1) of Xenopus kidney epithelial cells. They determined
that prostasin shares 41% sequence identity with the Xenopus protease
and 76% identity with the mouse homolog.

GENE FUNCTION

Donaldson et al. (2002) found that coexpression of prostasin with either
Xenopus or rat ENaC in Xenopus oocytes resulted in a 60 to 80% increase
in amiloride-sensitive sodium currents, and that the addition of
aprotinin, a serine protease inhibitor, completely prevented this
activation. By in situ hybridization, they determined that both
prostasin and TMPRSS2 (602060) show a tissue distribution in human
airway epithelia consistent with a role in ENaC regulation. Both had
strong expression in superficial epithelial cells lining the nose,
trachea, and distal airways, and both were expressed at the alveolar
level, most notably at alveolar junctions in a distribution
characteristic of type II pneumocytes. Expression was also pronounced in
submucosal glands associated with nasal, tracheal, and bronchial
tissues. Donaldson et al. (2002) suggested that prostasin is likely to
be the more physiologically relevant protease.

GENE STRUCTURE

Yu et al. (1996) isolated and characterized the full-length PRSS8 gene.
They found that it consists of 6 exons and 5 introns. The authors
characterized the 5-prime flanking region of the gene and found a number
of potential regulatory elements, including an AP2 site, 2
erythroid-specific promoter elements, and a sterol regulatory element,
although no TATA box was found. In addition, there were a variant GC box
and a variant AP1 site in the promoter region. Yu et al. (1996) found
that PRSS8 is a single-copy gene.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Yu et al. (1996) mapped the PRSS8
gene to chromosome 16p11.2.

606968	TITLE *606968 EUKARYOTIC ELONGATION FACTOR 2 KINASE; EEF2K
;;CALMODULIN-DEPENDENT PROTEIN KINASE III
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Elongation factor-2 (EEF2; 130610) kinase, or EEF2K, is a highly
conserved serine/threonine kinase in the calmodulin-mediated signaling
pathway whose activity is increased in many cancers. EEF2 is an abundant
cytoplasmic protein that catalyzes the movement of the ribosome along
mRNA during translation in eukaryotic cells.

CLONING

Using degenerate PCR primers based on worm and rabbit peptide sequences
for Eef2k, followed by 5-prime and 3-prime RACE and RT-PCR on a glioma
cell line, Ryazanov et al. (1997) obtained cDNAs encoding rodent and
human EEF2K. The deduced 725-amino acid human protein is 90% identical
to the rodent proteins. EEF2K lacks homology to other serine/threonine
kinases or to other calmodulin-dependent kinases, apart from a
glycine-rich loop that is part of the ATP-binding site. All EEF2K
sequences contain a highly conserved 200-residue catalytic domain. There
is also a conserved C-terminal coiled-coil region. SDS-PAGE and
functional analysis showed expression of a 100-kD protein whose activity
was strictly calmodulin-dependent. Northern blot analysis revealed
ubiquitous expression of a major 3.1-kb transcript and minor 6.1- and
2.5-kb transcripts. Expression was particularly abundant in heart and
skeletal muscle, suggesting that EEF2 phosphorylation may be
particularly important in muscle.

Arora et al. (2002) found that a majority of patients with systemic
lupus erythematosus (SLE; 152700) have high titer anti-EEF2K antibodies
capable of immunoprecipitating functional enzyme.

GENE FUNCTION

Autry et al. (2011) showed that ketamine and other NMDAR (see 138249)
antagonists produce fast-acting behavioral antidepressant-like effects
in mouse models, and that these effects depend on the rapid synthesis of
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF; 113505). They found that the
ketamine-mediated blockade of NMDAR at rest deactivates EEF2K, resulting
in reduced EEF2 phosphorylation and desuppression of translation of
BDNF. Furthermore, Autry et al. (2011) found that inhibitors of EEF2K
induce fast-acting behavioral antidepressant-like effects. Autry et al.
(2011) concluded that the regulation of protein synthesis by spontaneous
neurotransmission may serve as a viable therapeutic target for the
development of fast-acting antidepressants.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the EEF2K
gene to chromosome 16 (TMAP WI-11344).

610537	TITLE *610537 DIPEPTIDYL PEPTIDASE VII; DPP7
;;QUIESCENT CELL PROLINE DIPEPTIDASE; QPP
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

DPP7 is a proline dipeptidase found in peripheral blood mononuclear
cells (PBMCs) (Underwood et al., 1999).

CLONING

By screening PBMCs and DPP4 (102720)-negative Jurkat cells for
dipeptidase activity, followed by biochemical purification of the
cleavage activity, searching EST databases, and 5-prime RACE of human
leukocyte cDNA, Underwood et al. (1999) cloned DPP7, which they called
QPP. The predicted 492-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular
mass of 54.3 kD and contains the consensus sequence for the active-site
serine residue of serine-type proteases. It shares 42% amino acid
identity with the carboxypeptidase PRCP (176785), with higher identity
at the putative active-site residues. Northern blot analysis detected a
1.7-kb transcript in PBMCs and Jurkat T cells. SDS-PAGE analysis showed
expression of a 58-kD protein.

GENE FUNCTION

Underwood et al. (1999) showed that recombinant QPP expressed in 293T
human fibroblasts had ala-pro-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin cleaving
activity. QPP was active at both acidic and neutral pH.

Chiravuri et al. (2000) found that QPP underwent N-glycosylation, and
that the glycosylation was required for QPP enzymatic activity. Western
blot analysis of fractionated cell lines and confocal microscopy showed
that QPP was targeted to intracellular vesicles distinct from lysosomes.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the DPP7
gene to chromosome 9 (TMAP RH103183).

116949	TITLE *116949 CELL DIVISION CYCLE 25B; CDC25B
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The cell division cycle 25 (CDC25) family of proteins are highly
conserved dual specificity phosphatases that activate cyclin-dependent
kinase (CDK) complexes, which in turn regulate progression through the
cell division cycle. CDC25 phosphatases are also key components of the
checkpoint pathways that become activated in the event of DNA damage. In
mammalian cells, 3 isoforms have been identified: CDC25A (116947),
CDC25B, and CDC25C (157680). CDC25B and CDC25C are required primarily
for entry into mitosis. CDC25B is proposed to be responsible for the
initial activation of CDK1 (116940)-cyclin B (123836) at the centrosome
during the G2-M transition, which is then followed by a complete
activation of CDK1-cyclin B complexes by CDC25C in the nucleus at the
onset of mitosis (summary by Boutros et al., 2007).

MAPPING

Lane et al. (1993) demonstrated by fluorescence in situ hybridization
that CDC25B maps to 20p13. PCR analysis of a monochromosomal hybrid cell
panel yielded results supporting this chromosome assignment. Demetrick
and Beach (1993) also mapped CDC25B to chromosome 20p13 by fluorescence
in situ hybridization with confirmation by the polymerase chain reaction
of hamster/human somatic cell hybrid DNA.

GENE FUNCTION

Bulavin et al. (2001) reported that p38 kinase (600289) has a critical
role in the initiation of a G2 delay after ultraviolet radiation.
Inhibition of p38 blocks the rapid initiation of this checkpoint in both
human and murine cells after ultraviolet radiation. In vitro, p38 binds
and phosphorylates CDC25B at serines 309 and 361, and CDC25C at
serine-216; phosphorylation of these residues is required for binding to
14-3-3 proteins (see 113508). In vivo, inhibition of p38 prevents both
phosphorylation of CDC25B at serine-309 and 14-3-3 binding after
ultraviolet radiation, and mutation of this site is sufficient to
inhibit the checkpoint initiation. In contrast, in vivo CDC25C binding
to 14-3-3 is not affected by p38 inhibition after ultraviolet radiation.
Bulavin et al. (2001) proposed that regulation of CDC25B phosphorylation
by p38 is a critical event for initiating the G2/M checkpoint after
ultraviolet radiation.

By mutation and deletion analyses, Dalvai et al. (2011) showed that
downregulation of human CDC25B by p53 (TP53; 191170) was dependent on
the presence of functional SP1 (189906)/SP3 (601804)- and NFY (see
605344)-binding sites in CDC25B. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis
showed that p53 bound to the CDC25B promoter and mediated
transcriptional attenuation through SP1 and NFY transcription factors.
Dalvai et al. (2011) concluded that CDC25B is downregulated by the basal
level of p53 and proposed that CDC25B upregulation after p53 loss may
contribute to tumorigenesis.

ANIMAL MODEL

Lincoln et al. (2002) generated Cdc25b-deficient mice by targeted
disruption and found that they were viable. As compared with wildtype
cells, fibroblasts from Cdc25b -/- mice grew vigorously in culture and
arrested normally in response to DNA damage. Female Cdc25b -/- mice were
sterile and Cdc25b -/- oocytes remained arrested at prophase with low
maturation-promoting factor activity. Microinjection of wildtype Cdc25b
mRNA into Cdc25b -/- oocytes caused activation of maturation-promoting
factor and resumption of meiosis. Thus, Lincoln et al. (2002) concluded
that Cdc25b -/- female mice were sterile because of permanent meiotic
arrest resulting from the inability to activate the maturation-promoting
factor component CDK1. Cdc25b is therefore essential for meiotic
resumption in female mice. Lincoln et al. (2002) stated that mice
lacking Cdc25b provided the first genetic model for studying the
mechanisms regulating prophase arrest in vertebrates.

300462	TITLE *300462 A-KINASE ANCHOR PROTEIN 14; AKAP14
;;A-KINASE ANCHOR PROTEIN, 28-KD; AKAP28
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

A-kinase anchor proteins (AKAPs; see 602449) target protein kinase A
(PKA; see 176911) to discrete locations within the cell by binding the
regulatory subunit dimer of the PKA holoenzyme. AKAP28 is an axonemal
AKAP.

CLONING

Kultgen et al. (2002) identified AKAP28 as an axoneme-enriched PKA type
II regulatory subunit (RII)-binding protein by overlay analysis of
isolated cilia from well-differentiated human bronchial epithelial
(WD-HBE) cells. By screening a WD-HBE cDNA expression library using RII
as probe, followed by 5-prime and 3-prime RACE and database analysis,
Kultgen et al. (2002) obtained a full-length cDNA encoding AKAP28. The
deduced AKAP28 protein contains 197 amino acids and has an apparent
molecular mass of 28 kD. By database analysis, Kultgen et al. (2002)
determined that there are at least 3 AKAP28 splice variants, and RT-PCR
detected all 3 variants in trachea and testis. Northern blot analysis of
HBE cells detected upregulation of a 0.8-kb AKAP28 transcript as cells
differentiated and began to display a mucociliary phenotype. Northern
blot analysis of a multiple-tissue array showed predominant expression
of AKAP28 in trachea and testis, the only tissues examined that contain
axoneme-based organelles. Faint expression was also detected in adult
and fetal lung. Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry localized
AKAP28 to airway cilia.

GENE FUNCTION

By mutation analysis, Kultgen et al. (2002) confirmed that amino acids
35 to 52 of AKAP28 mediate binding of RII. Coimmunoprecipitation
analysis showed that recombinant AKAP28 associated with RII and the PKA
catalytic subunit, but not with RI, in HeLa cells. When heterologously
expressed in a cervical adenocarcinoma cell line, AKAP28 preferentially
bound type II PKA and was able to copurify with the PKA catalytic
subunit. Kultgen et al. (2002) concluded that AKAP28 acts as a type II
PKA anchor within cells.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Kultgen et al. (2002) mapped the AKAP28
gene to chromosome Xq24.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

O'Connell et al. (1989, 1990) demonstrated by genetic linkage and by
somatic cell hybrid and pulsed field gel electrophoresis that EVI2
(EVI2A), the human homolog of the mouse myeloid leukemia-associated gene
Evi2, maps between 2 breakpoints on the proximal part of 17q that define
the neurofibromatosis I region (162200).

Cawthon et al. (1990) isolated EVI2A cDNAs from human bone marrow and
frontal cortex cDNA libraries. The deduced 232-amino acid protein is
predicted to be a glycosylated protein with a single membrane-spanning
domain, a leucine zipper motif, and a cytoplasmic domain. There is a
high degree of conservation between the human and mouse EVI2A proteins.

MAPPING

Viskochil et al. (1991) reported that 3 genes, EVI2A, OMGP (164345), and
EVI2B, are embedded within an intron of NF1 on chromosome 17q11.2. All 3
genes had the same transcriptional orientation, which was opposite to
that of the NF1 gene.

;;PSF3, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; PSF3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The yeast heterotetrameric GINS complex is made up of Sld5 (GINS4;
610611), Psf1 (GINS1; 610608), Psf2 (GINS2; 610609), and Psf3. The
formation of the GINS complex is essential for the initiation of DNA
replication in yeast and Xenopus egg extracts (Ueno et al., 2005). See
GINS1 for additional information about the GINS complex.

CLONING

By searching a human database for sequences similar to yeast Psf3,
Takayama et al. (2003) identified GINS3, which they called PSF3. The
deduced protein contains 216 amino acids.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the GINS3
gene to chromosome 16 (TMAP RH65173).

NOMENCLATURE

The GINS complex derives its name from the Japanese words Go, Ichi, Nii,
and San, which mean 5, 1, 2, and 3, respectively, and refer to the
numbering of the yeast homologs of the GINS complex (Takayama et al.,
2003).

602887	TITLE *602887 DISCS LARGE, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, 4; DLG4
;;POSTSYNAPTIC DENSITY 95; PSD95;;
SYNAPSE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 90; SAP90
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

DLG4 belongs to the discs large (DLG) subfamily of the
membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family (see DLG1; 601014).
DLG4 interacts with both N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors (see
138249) and Shaker-type potassium channels (see 176260) and plays an
important role in the formation and maintenance of synaptic junctions
(Zhou and Blumberg, 2003).

CLONING

Proteins related to Drosophila 'discs large' (Dlg) are associated with
the cortical actin cytoskeleton and appear to have both structural and
functional roles. By screening a human mammary gland cDNA library with a
human EST showing homology to rat Psd95, which is also known as Sap90
(Kistner et al., 1993), Stathakis et al. (1997) cloned a cDNA encoding
DLG4, which they called PSD95. The predicted 723-amino acid DLG4 protein
has 3 PSD95-DLG-Z01 (PDZ) domains in its N-terminal half, a central src
homology-3 (SH3) motif, and a C-terminal guanylate kinase
(GUK)-homologous domain. The human DLG4 protein is 99% identical to the
rat and mouse Psd95 proteins and 56% identical to the Drosophila Dlg
protein. Northern blot analysis detected 6 DLG4 transcripts with
different expression patterns, including a 4.2-kb transcript that was
variably expressed in all 17 human tissues examined. Western blot
analysis using antibodies against DLG4 detected multiple proteins with
complex distribution patterns, including a ubiquitous 85-kD and
tissue-specific variants.

By examining human brain, mammary gland, pancreas, and testis cDNA
libraries, Stathakis et al. (1999) identified 3 splice variants of DLG4.
A transcript lacking exon 3 was detected in brain, but not in other
tissues. This variant introduces an early frameshift and encodes a
predicted 45-amino acid peptide. However, a downstream ORF from exons 4
through 22 has the potential to encode a 664-amino acid protein
containing all functional domains of DLG4, with a single residue before
the first PDZ domain. A variant lacking exon 20 was detected in mammary
gland and testis, but not in brain or pancreas. This variant encodes a
deduced 670-amino acid protein that lacks part of the C-terminal GUK
domain. A variant containing a 99-nucleotide extension of exon 4 (exon
4b) was detected in testis, but not in other tissues. This variant
encodes a deduced 803-amino acid protein with 33 additional amino acids
inserted before the first PDZ domain.

Zhou and Blumberg (2003) stated that the N terminus of DLG4 is modified
by thioester-linked palmitate, which targets the protein to cell
membranes. Palmitoylation is also a critical regulatory mechanism for
receptor interactions with DLG4. Real-time RT-PCR detected DLG4
expression in all tissues examined, with highest expression in brain,
followed by heart, placenta, lung, pancreas, spleen, thymus, testis,
ovary, and small intestine.

GENE FUNCTION

The proper distribution of voltage-gated and ligand-gated ion channels
on the neuronal surface is critical for the processing and transmission
of electrical signals in neurons. Kim et al. (1995) and Kim et al.
(1996) demonstrated that PSD95 and chapsyn-110 (603583) mediated
clustering of both NMDA receptors and potassium channels. Chapsyn-110
and PSD95 heteromultimerized with each other and were recruited into the
same NMDA receptor and potassium channel clusters. Kim et al. (1996)
suggested that these 2 proteins may interact at postsynaptic sites to
form a multimeric scaffold for the clustering of receptors, ion
channels, and associated signaling proteins.

In cultured cortical neurons, Sattler et al. (1999) suppressed
expression of the NMDA receptor scaffolding protein PSD95 and observed
selective attenuation of excitotoxicity triggered via NMDA receptors,
but not by other glutamate or calcium ion channels. NMDA receptor
function was unaffected because receptor expression, NMDA currents, and
calcium-45 loading were unchanged. Suppressing PSD95 blocked
calcium-activated nitric oxide production by NMDA receptors selectively
without affecting neuronal nitric oxide synthase expression or function.
Thus, PSD95 is required for efficient coupling of NMDAR activity to
nitric oxide toxicity and imparts specificity to excitotoxic calcium
signaling.

El-Husseini et al. (2000) found that overexpression of PSD95 in
hippocampal neurons could drive maturation of glutamatergic synapses.
PSD95 expression enhanced postsynaptic clustering and activity of
glutamate receptors. Postsynaptic expression of PSD95 also enhanced
maturation of the presynaptic terminal. These effects required synaptic
clustering of PSD95 but did not rely on its guanylate kinase domain.
PSD95 expression also increased the number and size of dendritic spines.
El-Husseini et al. (2000) concluded that PSD95 can orchestrate synaptic
development and suggested that PSD95 has a role in synapse stabilization
and plasticity.

Neuregulins and their receptors, the ERBB protein tyrosine kinases, are
essential for neuronal development, but their functions in the adult
central nervous system are unknown. Huang et al. (2000) reported that
ERBB4 (600543) is enriched in the postsynaptic density and associates
with PSD95. Heterologous expression of PSD95 enhanced NRG (142445)
activation of ERBB4 and MAP kinase (see 176948). Conversely, inhibiting
expression of PSD95 in neurons attenuated NRG-mediated activation of MAP
kinase. PSD95 formed a ternary complex with 2 molecules of ERBB4,
suggesting that PSD95 facilitates ERBB4 dimerization. Finally, NRG
suppressed induction of long-term potentiation in the hippocampal CA1
region without affecting basal synaptic transmission. Thus, NRG
signaling may be synaptic and regulated by PSD95. Huang et al. (2000)
concluded that a role of NRG signaling in the adult central nervous
system may be modulation of synaptic plasticity.

El-Husseini et al. (2002) identified palmitate cycling on PSD95 at the
synapse and found that palmitate turnover on PSD95 is regulated by
glutamate receptor activity. Acutely blocking palmitoylation dispersed
synaptic clusters of PSD95 and caused a selective loss of synaptic AMPA
receptors (e.g., GRIA1; 138248). The authors also found that rapid
glutamate-mediated AMPA receptor internalization requires
depalmitoylation of PSD95. In a nonneuronal model system, clustering of
PSD95, stargazin (602911), and AMPA receptors was also regulated by
ongoing palmitoylation of PSD95 at the plasma membrane. El-Husseini et
al. (2002) concluded that palmitate cycling on PSD95 can regulate
synaptic strength and activity-dependent plasticity.

To treat stroke without blocking NMDA receptors, Aarts et al. (2002)
transduced neurons with peptides that disrupted the interaction of NMDA
receptors with the postsynaptic density protein PSD95. This procedure
dissociated NMDA receptors from downstream neurotoxic signaling without
blocking synaptic activity or calcium influx. The peptides, when applied
either before or 1 hour after an insult, protected cultured neurons from
excitotoxicity, reduced focal ischemic brain damage in rats, and
improved their neurologic function. Aarts et al. (2002) concluded that
their approach circumvents the negative consequences associated with
blocking NMDA receptors and may constitute a practical stroke therapy.

In cotransfection experiments, Tanemoto et al. (2002) showed that Kir5.1
(KCNJ16; 605722) assembled to form a functional homomeric potassium
channel by interacting with PSD95. The authors observed that Kir5.1
expressed alone was distributed mostly in the cytoplasm, but Kir5.1
coexpressed with PSD95 was located on the plasma membrane in a clustered
manner. Using GST pull-down studies, Tanemoto et al. (2002) identified
domains responsible for Kir5.1/PSD95 interaction. They reported that
protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated phosphorylation of Kir5.1 disrupted the
binding of Kir5.1 with PSD95. Tanemoto et al. (2002) hypothesized that
Kir5.1/PSD95 forms a functional brain potassium channel that may be a
physiologic target of PKA-mediated signaling. They concluded that PSD95
mediates formation of a functional potassium channel in the brain.

Conroy et al. (2003) showed that PDZ-containing proteins of the Psd95
family were required for maturation of functional nicotinic synapses in
embryonic chicken ciliary ganglia. These proteins also helped mediate
downstream activation of transcription factors.

Colledge et al. (2003) found that Psd95 interacted with and was
ubiquitinated by the E3 ligase Mdm2 (164785). In response to NMDA
receptor activation in cultured rat hippocampal neurons, Psd95 was
ubiquitinated and rapidly removed from synaptic sites by
proteasome-dependent degradation. Mutations that blocked Psd95
ubiquitination prevented NMDA-induced AMPA receptor endocytosis.
Likewise, proteasome inhibitors prevented NMDA-induced AMPA receptor
internalization and synaptically induced long-term depression. Colledge
et al. (2003) concluded that ubiquitination of PSD95 through an
MDM2-mediated pathway regulates AMPA receptor surface expression during
synaptic plasticity.

Bao et al. (2004) found that sound-induced synaptic activity in the
mouse cochlea increased the level of nuclear neuregulin-1 intracellular
domain (Nrg-ICD) and upregulated PSD95 in postsynaptic spiral ganglion
neurons. Nrg-ICD enhanced the transcriptional activity of the PSD95
promoter by binding to Eos (606239), a zinc finger transcription factor.
The findings identified a molecular basis for activity-dependent
synaptic plasticity.

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis of a mouse brain cDNA library, Li et al.
(2006) found that Gng13 (607298) interacted with Psd95. Mutation
analysis showed that the interaction involved the third PDZ domain of
Psd95 and the C-terminal CAAX motif of Gng13. Coexpression of Gng13 with
its G protein partner, Gnb1 (139380), did not interfere with the
interaction. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis confirmed the interaction
between Psd95 and Gng13.

Aartsen et al. (2006) found that Mpp4 -/- mouse retinas showed
downregulation of Psd95 and mislocalization of both Psd95 and Veli3
(LIN7C; 612332) at the photoreceptor presynaptic membrane. They proposed
that MPP4 may function as a recruitment factor to organize signal
transducers at the photoreceptor synapse.

Kim et al. (2007) showed that phosphorylation of Psd95 in rat
hippocampal neurons enhanced Psd95 synaptic accumulation and the ability
of Psd95 to recruit surface AMPA receptors and potentiate excitatory
postsynaptic currents. They determined that the Rac1 (602048)-Jnk1
(MAPK8; 601158) signaling pathway mediated this phosphorylation.
Overexpression of a phosphomimicking mutant of Psd95 inhibited
NMDA-induced AMPA receptor internalization and blocked induction of
long-term depression.

Using PSD95 inhibitors, which uncouple postsynaptic density protein
PSD95 from neurotoxic signaling pathways, in gyrencephalic nonhuman
primates (cynomolgus macaques), Cook et al. (2012) showed that stroke
damage can be prevented when a PSD95 inhibitor is administered after
stroke onset in clinically relevant situations. The treatment reduced
infarct volumes as gauged by MRI and histology, preserved the capacity
of ischemic cells to maintain gene transcription in genomewide screens
of ischemic brain tissue, and significantly preserved neurologic
function in neurobehavioral assays. The degree of tissue neuroprotection
by MRI corresponded strongly to the preservation of neurologic function,
supporting the intuitive but unproven dictum that integrity of brain
tissue can reflect functional outcome. Cook et al. (2012) concluded that
their findings established that tissue neuroprotection and improved
functional outcome after stroke is unequivocally achievable in
gyrencephalic nonhuman primates treated with PSD95 inhibitors.

GENE STRUCTURE

Stathakis et al. (1999) determined that the DLG4 gene contains 22 exons
and spans about 30 kb. All splice sites conform to the GT-AG rule,
except for the splice acceptor site of intron 5, which is TG instead of
AG. The promoter region contains no TATA or CAAT boxes, but has a large
GC-rich domain with characteristics of a CpG island.

Zhang et al. (2003) noted that the VLCAD (609575) and the DLG4 genes are
located in a head-to-head orientation on chromosome 17p. The transcribed
regions of the 2 genes overlap by about 220 bp. Using serial promoter
partial deletion constructs in a reporter gene assay, they found that
the essential promoter activity of DLG4 is carried within a region of
about 400 bp and covers the entire VLCAD minimal promoter, which spans
about 270 bp. The results from di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate
(DEHP)-treated HepG2 cells revealed that the minimal VLCAD promoter can
upregulate VLCAD expression in response to DEHP treatment. Site-directed
mutagenesis experiments showed that a mutated AP2 (107580)-binding site
markedly reduced the transcriptional activity of both the VLCAD and DLG4
promoters and abolished the minimal VLCAD promoter's response to DEHP
treatment.

Independently, Zhou and Blumberg (2003) determined that the VLCAD and
DLG4 genes overlap. The 2 genes share 245 nucleotides at their 5-prime
ends, and the transcription start site for DLG4 extends into the coding
region of VLCAD exon 1. The upstream regions of the VLCAD and DLG4
genes, including the overlapping region, contain 2 potential TATA-less
promoters with potential binding sites for several common transcription
factors. RT-PCR detected unique patterns of expression for VLCAD and
DLG4, indicating that, although they share common regulatory elements,
VLCAD and DLG4 also have distinct tissue-specific elements. The mouse
Dlg4 and Vlcad genes are oriented in a head-to-head manner, but they do
not overlap and are separated by almost 3.5 kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid mapping, Stathakis et al. (1997) localized the DLG4
gene to chromosome 17p13.1.

ANIMAL MODEL

Specific patterns of neuronal firing induce changes in synaptic strength
that may contribute to learning and memory. If the postsynaptic NMDA
receptors are blocked, long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term
depression (LTD) of synaptic transmission and the learning of spatial
information are prevented. The NMDA receptor can bind PSD95, which may
regulate the localization of and/or signaling by the receptor. Migaud et
al. (1998) found that in mutant mice lacking Psd95, the frequency
function of NMDA-dependent LTP and LTD was shifted to produce strikingly
enhanced LTP at different frequencies of synaptic stimulation. In
keeping with neural-network models that incorporate bidirectional
learning rules, this frequency shift was accompanied by severely
impaired spatial learning. Synaptic NMDA-receptor currents, subunit
expression, localization, and synaptic morphology were all unaffected in
the mutant mice. PSD95 thus appears to be important in coupling the NMDA
receptor to pathways that control bidirectional synaptic plasticity and
learning.

Using microarray analysis, Yao et al. (2004) identified Psd95 among a
small number of genes whose expression was downregulated in Dat (SLC6A3;
126455) -/- mice, Net (SLC6A2; 163970) -/- mice, and Vmat2 (SLC18A2;
193001) +/- mice, all of which are models of dopamine supersensitivity,
as well as in mice chronically treated with cocaine. In all 4 models,
Psd95 mRNA and protein levels were downregulated in nucleus accumbens
and caudate putamen. Psd95 protein was also decreased specifically in
striatum, but not in cortex and hippocampus, of cocaine-treated animals.
Enhanced long-term potentiation of frontocortico-accumbal glutamatergic
synapses correlated with reduced Psd95 levels in all 4 models. Yao et
al. (2004) also found that Psd95 -/- mice were supersensitive to cocaine
and lacked chronic cocaine-induced behavioral plasticity.

Beique et al. (2006) found that Psd95-null mice had decreased glutamate
AMPA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission but NMDA receptors were not
affected. Although most of the affected synapses were located on
morphologically mature dendritic spines, a significant population of
synapses appeared unaffected by Psd95 depletion, suggesting that the
functional role of Psd95 displays synapse specificity.

606016	TITLE *606016 KELCH-LIKE ECH-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 1; KEAP1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

KEAP1 is a substrate adaptor protein for a CUL3 (603136)-dependent
ubiquitin ligase complex that functions as a sensor for thiol-reactive
chemopreventive compounds and oxidative stress (Lo and Hannink, 2006).

CLONING

Transcription factor NRF2 (600492), which is homologous to the chicken
Ech protein, is essential for the expression of detoxifying enzymes and
oxidative stress-inducible genes to protect against DNA damage. Using a
yeast 2-hybrid screen of a mouse embryo cDNA library with mouse Nrf2 as
bait, Itoh et al. (1999) isolated cDNAs encoding a protein they named
'Kelch-like Ech-associated protein-1,' or Keap1, due to its resemblance
to the Drosophila Kelch protein. Sequence analysis predicted that the
624-amino acid mouse protein is 94% identical to the 624-amino acid
human KIAA0132 protein identified by Nagase et al. (1995). Keap1
contains a central BTB/POZ domain and a C-terminal double glycine repeat
(DGR), or Kelch, module. By RT-PCR analysis, Nagase et al. (1995)
detected strong expression of KIAA0132 in heart and skeletal muscle,
with lower expression in brain, placenta, lung, liver, testis, ovary,
small intestine, and colon, and weaker or undetectable expression in
other tissues.

MAPPING

Nagase et al. (1995) mapped the KIAA0132 gene (KEAP1) to chromosome 19
by analysis of a human-rodent hybrid cell panel.

GENE FUNCTION

Using yeast 2-hybrid and BIAcore analyses of mutant Keap1, Itoh et al.
(1999) showed that the Kelch motifs of Keap1 interact with the Neh2
domain of Nrf2 and that this interaction is required for the repression
of Nrf2 by Keap1. Fluorescence microscopy demonstrated that Keap1 is
expressed in the cytoplasm with Nrf2. In the presence of the
electrophilic agent diethylmalate, Nrf2 activity was released from Keap1
and Nrf2 translocated to the nucleus.

Eades et al. (2011) found that microRNA-200A (MIR200A; 612090) bound to
the 3-prime UTR of the KEAP1 transcript, leading to degradation of the
mRNA. Epigenetic silencing of MIR200A in breast cancer cells resulted in
KEAP1 dysregulation, inhibition of NRF2 transcriptional activity, and
reduced expression of NQO1 (125860), a detoxifying NRF2 target gene.
Overexpression of MIR200A in human breast cancer cells or treatment of a
mouse model of breast cancer with a histone deacetylase inhibitor
enhanced MIR200A-dependent KEAP1 downregulation and restored NRF2
expression.

Using mass spectrometric analysis and database analysis to identify
transcripts encoding proteins other than NRF2 that copurified with KEAP1
from the MD-MB-231 breast carcinoma cell line, Lo and Hannink (2006)
identified 2 splice variants of PGAM5 (614939). Protein interaction
assays and mutation analysis revealed that the putative N-terminal
KEAP1-binding motif of both PGAM5 isoforms interacted with the Kelch
domain of KEAP1 in transfected HEK293T cells. Coexpression of KEAP1 with
the long isoform of PGAM5 (PGAM5L) resulted in PGAM5L ubiquitination and
reduced PGAM5L half-life and total protein content. Coexpression of CUL3
and RBX1 (603814) markedly induced KEAP1-dependent PGAML ubiquitination,
and proteasome inhibition blocked KEAP1-dependent PGAM5L degradation.
Oxidative stress or treatment of cells with the chemotherapeutic
isothiocyanate sulforaphane inhibited KEAP1-dependent PGAM5L
ubiquitination and increased steady-state PGAM5L protein levels.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Padmanabhan et al. (2006) resolved the crystal structure of the 6-bladed
Kelch repeat and the C-terminal region of mouse Keap1. Extensive inter-
and intrablade hydrogen bonds maintained the structural integrity and
proper association of Keap1 with Nrf2. A peptide containing the ETGE
motif of Nrf2 bound the beta propeller of Keap1 at the entrance of the
central cavity on the bottom side via electrostatic interactions with
conserved arginines. Padmanabhan et al. (2006) identified 2 mutations in
cell lines from lung cancer patients that disrupted the interaction
between Keap1 and Nrf2, thus reducing the ability of Keap1 to repress
Nrf2 transcriptional activity.

ANIMAL MODEL

Transcription factor NRF2 (600492) regulates a battery of detoxifying
and antioxidant genes, and KEAP1 represses NRF2 function. Wakabayashi et
al. (2003) found that Keap1-deficient mice died postnatally, probably
from malnutrition resulting from hyperkeratosis in the esophagus and
forestomach. Nrf2 activity affects the expression levels of several
squamous epithelial genes. Biochemical data showed that, without Keap1,
Nrf2 constitutively accumulates in the nucleus to stimulate
transcription of cytoprotective genes. Breeding to Nrf2-deficient mice
reversed the phenotypic Keap1 deficiencies. These experiments showed
that Keap1 acts upstream of Nrf2 in the cellular response to oxidative
and xenobiotic stress.

Wakabayashi et al. (2003) observed that the transient scaling phenotype
of Keap1 -/- mouse skin is similar to that of autosomal recessive
congenital ichthyosis (ARCI). In a Finnish kindred, Virolainen et al.
(2000) identified an ARCI locus corresponding to 19p13.2-p13.1 (see
ARCI5; 604777). The human KEAP1 locus is located at the same chromosomal
position as this autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis locus. Thus,
KEAP1 may have some relationship to congenital ichthyosis. The scaling
of the reported Finnish cases was mild, as in the scaling phenotype of
the Keap1 mutants, but the neonatal onset of the disorder in Keap1
mutants differed from the human disorder.

;;EPH-RELATED RECEPTOR TYROSINE KINASE LIGAND 6; EPLG6;;
LIGAND OF EPH-RELATED KINASE 6; LERK6
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

See 179610 for background on ephrins and the Eph receptor family.

CLONING

By screening a human genomic library with a mouse ephrin-A2 (Efna2)
cDNA, Cerretti and Nelson (1998) isolated the genomic sequence of EFNA2.
The predicted 213-amino acid EFNA2 protein is composed of a signal
sequence, a receptor-binding region, a spacer region, and a hydrophobic
region.

By screening a fetal brain cDNA library with a fragment of human EFNA4
(601380), Aasheim et al. (1998) cloned a human EFNA2 cDNA. The deduced
214-amino acid protein contained a signal sequence, 3 potential
N-glycosylation sites, and a hydrophilic C terminus including a GPI
linkage signal. Northern blot analysis of human tissues detected a
single 2.4-kb transcript in fetal intestine and brain and in adult
colon, small intestine, and lung. During mouse embryogenesis, Efna2 is
first detected in the dorsal region of the presumptive midbrain at
embryonic (E) day 8. By E9, there are high levels of Efna2 expression in
the midbrain and lower levels in the dorsal anterior hindbrain. Between
E8.5 and E11, it is expressed in the first and second branchial arches,
somites, and limb buds.

GENE STRUCTURE

Cerretti and Nelson (1998) determined that the EFNA2 gene has 4 exons;
its structure is identical to the gene structures of mouse Efna3
(601381), Efna4, and Efnb1 (300035) through the first 3 exons.

GENE FUNCTION

Although ephrins form a high-affinity multivalent complex with their
receptors present on axons, axons can be rapidly repelled rather than
being bound. Hattori et al. (2000) showed that ephrin-A2 forms a stable
complex with the metalloproteinase Kuzbanian (ADAM10; 602192), involving
interactions outside the cleavage region and the protease domain. Eph
receptor binding triggered ephrin-A2 cleavage in a localized reaction
specific to the cognate ligand. The cleavage-inhibiting mutation in
ephrin-A2 delayed axon withdrawal. Hattori et al. (2000) concluded that
their studies reveal mechanisms for protease recognition and control of
cell surface proteins, and, for ephrin-A2, they may provide a means for
efficient axon detachment and termination of signaling.

Using immunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy, Lim et al. (2008)
demonstrated that nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR; 162010) and
ephrin-As, including Efna2 and Efna5 (601535), colocalized within
caveolae along mouse retinal axons and formed a complex required for Fyn
(137025) phosphorylation upon binding EphAs, activating a signaling
pathway that led to cytoskeletal changes. Retinal axons repulsed EphAs
by ephrin-A reverse signaling in an Ngfr-dependent manner. Mice lacking
Ngfr constitutively or specifically in retina had aberrant anterior
shifts in retinal axon terminations in the superior colliculus,
consistent with diminished repellent activity mediated by graded
collicular EphAs. Lim et al. (2008) concluded that NGFR is a signaling
partner for EPHAs and that the EPHA/NGFR complex reverse signals to
mediate axon repulsion required for guidance and mapping.

MAPPING

Using PCR-based screening of genomic DNA from human/rodent hybrid cell
lines, Aasheim et al. (1998) mapped the EFNA2 gene to chromosome 19. By
FISH, they narrowed the location to 19p13.3.

ANIMAL MODEL

Cang et al. (2005) created Efna2/Efna3 (601381)/Efna5 (601535)
triple-knockout (TKO) mice and found that the thalamocortical
projections from the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus to the visual
cortex showed abnormal topographic mapping. Functional imaging in
Efna-TKO mice revealed that the primary visual area (V1) was rotated and
shifted medially and that the internal organization of the visuotopic
map was disrupted. Cang et al. (2005) concluded that EFNAs guide the
formation of functional maps in the visual cortex.

;;ADP-RIBOSYLATION FACTOR GUANINE NUCLEOTIDE EXCHANGE PROTEIN, 100-KD;
ARFGEP100;;
LONER, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF;;
KIAA0763
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated human brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) cloned IQSEC1, which they designated
KIAA0763. The deduced protein contains 841 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA
detected highest IQSEC1 expression in brain, ovary, heart, lung, liver,
and kidney. Moderate expression was detected in skeletal muscle,
pancreas, spleen, and testis.

Someya et al. (2001) further characterized the KIAA0763 clone, which
they designated ARFGEP100. The deduced protein contains an N-terminal
IQ-like motif, a central serine-rich region and Sec7 domain, and a
C-terminal pleckstrin homology domain. Northern blot analysis detected
an 8-kb transcript expressed abundantly in leukocytes, brain, and spleen
and at lower levels in lung, placenta, small intestine, liver, and
kidney. A 7-kb transcript was also detected in brain. Endogenous
ARFGEP100 distributed with the cytosolic fraction of a fractionated
human glioblastoma cells. Western blot analysis detected ARFGEP100 at an
apparent molecular mass of 100 kD. Immunofluorescence microscopy
revealed ARFGEP100 in a cytosolic punctate pattern, and it colocalized
with ARF6 (600464) in peripheral areas.

GENE FUNCTION

Someya et al. (2001) found that ARFGEP100 accelerated binding of a
nonhydrolyzable GTP analog to recombinant ARF1 (103180) and ARF5
(103188) 2- to 3-fold and to ARF6 12-fold. ARFGEP100 activity was not
altered by brefeldin A or phospholipids.

Chen et al. (2003) found that Drosophila Loner, the homolog of human
IQSEC1, was required for myoblast fusion. In Drosophila embryos, Loner
localized to subcellular sites of fusion and acted downstream of cell
surface fusion receptors by recruiting Arf6 and stimulating guanine
nucleotide exchange.

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis of a fetal brain cDNA library, Hiroi et al.
(2006) found that GEP100 specifically interacted with alpha-catenin
(CTNNA1; 116805). Coimmunoprecipitation analysis of hepatoma (HepG2) and
cervical carcinoma (CaSki) cell lines confirmed interaction between
endogenous GEP100 and alpha-catenin. Depletion of GEP100 by small
interfering RNA in HepG2 and CaSki cells increased E-cadherin (CDH1;
192090) content 3-fold and blocked hepatocyte growth factor (HGF;
142409)-induced redistribution of E-cadherin, consistent with a known
role of ARF6 in this process. F-actin was markedly decreased in rat
kidney cells overexpressing wildtype GEP100, but not its GEP-inactive
mutants. Hiroi et al. (2006) concluded that GEP100 has a role in
activation of ARF6 for its functions in E-cadherin recycling and actin
remodeling.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the IQSEC1
gene to chromosome 3.

;;ATP-BINDING CASSETTE 50; ABC50
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The family of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) proteins (e.g., 601691) is
extensive and is responsible for the transport of a variety of molecules
across biologic membranes. Using differential display PCR to identify
genes that are modulated by TNF-alpha (191160) in synoviocytes, Richard
et al. (1998) isolated a cDNA encoding a novel member of the ABC family,
named ABC50. The deduced 807-amino acid ABC50 protein has 2 ABC
transporter family signature motifs, 2 ATP/GTP-binding site A motifs,
and 3 nuclear localization patterns. The authors found that ABC50 also
contains a signature sequence that is characteristic of yeast cluster IV
ABC proteins. Unlike most previously reported family members, ABC50 does
not contain a transmembrane domain. Northern blot analysis demonstrated
ubiquitous expression of a 3.7-kb ABC50 transcript in human tissues.
TNF-alpha stimulation increased the expression of the ABC50 mRNA in
cultured synoviocytes.

GENE STRUCTURE

Berezikov et al. (2007) determined that intron 13 of the ABCF1 gene
contains the microRNA MIRN877 (611619).

MAPPING

Richard et al. (1998) used fluorescence in situ hybridization to map the
human ABC50 gene to chromosome 6p21.33.

609775	TITLE *609775 YIP1 DOMAIN FAMILY, MEMBER 3; YIPF3
;;KILLER LINEAGE PROTEIN 1; KLIP1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using RNA differential display to identify genes expressed during early
human embryonic hematopoiesis, followed by screening a human lung cDNA
library, Prost et al. (2002) cloned YIPF3, which they designated KLIP1.
The deduced 350-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 37
to 38 kD. KLIP1 contains an N-terminal signal sequence, followed by an
extracellular domain, 5 transmembrane regions, and a cytoplasmic
C-terminal sequence. It also has 3 potential protein kinase C (see
PRKCA; 176960) phosphorylation sites. KLIP1 expression closely
correlated with hematopoietic activity in both intra- and
extra-embryonic hematopoietic sites. In day 30/32 human embryo sections,
KLIP1 protein expression was restricted to circulating hematopoietic
cells at hematopoiesis sites. Membrane KLIP1 was expressed by fetal and
adult GPA (111300)-positive erythroblasts, the fetal liver CD34
(142230)-positive subset, fetal spleen, and adult bone marrow CD56
(NCAM1; 116930)-positive natural killer and CD19 (107265)-positive B
cells. Among mature blood cells, surface KLIP1 expression was restricted
to CD56-positive natural killer cells. Western blot analysis of fetal
liver extracts and in vitro translated KLIP1 cDNA detected the KLIP1
protein at an apparent molecular mass of 37 kD. Phylogenetic analysis
indicated that KLIP1 is highly conserved.

GENE STRUCTURE

Prost et al. (2002) determined that the YIPF3 gene contains 9 exons and
spans about 5 kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Prost et al. (2002) mapped the YIPF3 gene
to chromosome 6p21.2-p21.1.

300526	TITLE *300526 WD REPEAT-CONTAINING PROTEIN 45; WDR45
;;WD40 REPEAT PROTEIN INTERACTING WITH PHOSPHOINOSITIDES 4; WIPI4
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

WD40 repeat proteins are key components of many essential biologic
functions. They regulate the assembly of multiprotein complexes by
presenting a beta-propeller platform for simultaneous and reversible
protein-protein interactions. Members of the WIPI subfamily of WD40
repeat proteins, such as WIPI4, have a 7-bladed propeller structure and
contain a conserved motif for interaction with phospholipids
(Proikas-Cezanne et al., 2004).

CLONING

By searching a genomic database for sequences similar to WIPI1 (609224),
followed by RT-PCR of normal testis mRNA, Proikas-Cezanne et al. (2004)
cloned WIPI4. The deduced protein contains 7 WD-like repeats. Northern
blot analysis detected ubiquitous expression of an approximately 1.8-kb
transcript. Highest expression was in heart and skeletal muscle.
Proikas-Cezanne et al. (2004) also found that WIPI4 expression was
downregulated in a significant portion of renal and pancreatic cancers.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Proikas-Cezanne et al. (2004) mapped the
WIPI4 gene to chromosome Xp11.23. They identified a putative WIPI4
pseudogene at chromosome 4q31.3.

GENE FUNCTION

The WDR45 gene has an important role in the autophagy pathway, which is
the major intracellular degradation system by which cytoplasmic
materials are packaged into autophagosomes and delivered to lysosomes
for degradation (summary by Saitsu et al., 2013).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 20 unrelated patients with neurodegeneration with brain iron
accumulation-5 (NBIA5; 300894), Haack et al. (2012) identified 19
different de novo heterozygous or hemizygous mutations in the WDR45 gene
(see, e.g., 300526.0001-300526.0002). Most of the mutations were
truncating, but 2 were missense mutations affecting highly conserved
residues. The mutations were located throughout the coding sequence.
Initial mutations were identified by exome sequencing and all were
confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Seventeen females and 3 males were
affected, and the phenotype was similar in all. Since WDR45 is on the X
chromosome, Haack et al. (2012) concluded that the males must be somatic
mosaic for the mutation, which was demonstrated in 1 affected male.
Presumably, males with germline WDR45 mutations are nonviable. Females
may either harbor germline or somatic mutations, and several affected
females had evidence of skewed X inactivation. These factors may
contribute to disease manifestations.

Saitsu et al. (2013) identified 5 different de novo heterozygous
truncating mutations in the WDR45 gene (see, e.g.,
300526.0003-300526.0005) in 5 unrelated women with NBIA5. The initial
mutations were identified by exome sequencing of 2 patients. Patients
had delayed psychomotor development in infancy or early childhood that
remained stable until young adulthood when all patients developed
further severe motor and cognitive decline, with parkinsonism, dystonia,
extrapyramidal signs, and dementia. Most became bedridden with an
inability to care for themselves. Brain MRI showed iron accumulation in
the globus pallidus and substantia nigra. Lymphoblastoid cells from 4 of
the patients showed exclusive expression of the mutant transcript,
suggesting X inactivation of the wildtype allele. All patient cells
showed decreased levels of the mutant proteins, suggesting protein
instability. Patient cells showed impaired autophagic flux.
Immunofluorescence studies showed the accumulation of autophagic
structures in patient cells, consistent with improper autophagosome
formation. The findings suggested that impairment of autophagy
contributes to the pathogenesis of this neurodegenerative disorder.

153337	TITLE *153337 LYMPHOCYTE ACTIVATION GENE 3; LAG3
;;CD223 ANTIGEN; CD223
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Triebel et al. (1990) identified a novel human gene of the Ig
superfamily, which they designated LAG3. Expression of this gene was
undetectable in resting peripheral blood lymphocytes, whereas it was
found in activated T and NK cells. The corresponding cDNA encodes a
498-amino acid membrane protein with 4 extracellular Ig-like domains.
The sequence data, exon/intron organization, and chromosomal
localization all indicate a close relationship of LAG3 to CD4 (186940).
The 2 genes are probably derived from a common evolutionary ancestor.

GENE FUNCTION

Andreae et al. (2002) showed that a LAG3-immunoglobulin (Ig) fusion
protein induced the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs). LAG3-Ig bound
MHC class II molecules expressed in plasma membrane lipid rafts and
induced rapid morphologic changes, including the formation of dendritic
projections. Furthermore, it upregulated the expression of costimulatory
molecules and the production of interleukin-12 (IL12; 161561) and tumor
necrosis factor (TNF; 191160). At the same time, the fusion protein, but
not MHC class II-specific antibody, disabled DCs in their capacity to
capture soluble antigens and increased DCs capacity to induce
proliferation and gamma-interferon (IFNG; 147570) secretion by
allogeneic T cells.

Brignone et al. (2007) noted that resistance to tuberculosis and
favorable breast cancer outcomes are associated with high serum levels
of a natural soluble form of LAG3. They found that a soluble LAG3-Ig
fusion protein, which they termed IMP321, bound to a small subset of
peripheral blood cells, including all myeloid DCs. These myeloid DCs
then produced TNF and CCL4 (182284), followed by DC-dependent granzyme
(GZMB; 123910)-positive fully differentiated CD8 (see 186910) and NK
lymphocyte production of IFNG and TNF. Brignone et al. (2007) proposed
that IMP321 activates effector cells that may promote responses
beneficial to cancer patients.

GENE STRUCTURE

Triebel et al. (1990) determined that the LAG3 gene contains 8 exons.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using mice expressing influenza virus HA either as a self antigen or as
a tumor/tissue antigen and wildtype or Lag3 -/- mouse T cells, Grosso et
al. (2007) demonstrated a role for Lag3 in regulating T-cell tolerance
to both self and tumor antigens. Lag3 expression was increased on
antigen-specific Cd8 (see 186910)-positive T cells within
antigen-expressing organs or tumors. Blockade or genetic deletion of
Lag3 resulted in increased accumulation and effector function of
antigen-specific Cd8-positive T cells within organs and tumors
expressing their cognate antigen. Moreover, combining Lag3 blockade with
specific antitumor vaccination significantly increased numbers of
activated Cd8-positive T cells in tumors and disrupted the tumor
parenchyma. Grosso et al. (2007) concluded that LAG3 is expressed on
CD8-positive tumor-infiltrating cells and that LAG3 blockade may be
useful in cancer treatment.

MAPPING

Triebel et al. (1990) localized the LAG3 gene to 12p13.3 (probably
12p13.32) by in situ hybridization using a biotinylated LAG3 probe.

612693	TITLE *612693 UBIQUITIN-RELATED MODIFIER 1, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; URM1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching databases for sequences similar to mouse Urm1, Singh et al.
(2005) identified human URM1. The deduced 101-amino acid protein shares
93% identity with mouse Urm1.

Schlieker et al. (2008) cloned human URM1 from a HeLa cell cDNA library.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, Singh et al. (2005)
determined the solution structure of mouse Urm1. They found that Urm1
assumed a beta-grasp fold similar to those of eukaryotic ubiquitin (UBB;
191339) and the bacterial sulfur carrier proteins MoaD and ThiS.

GENE FUNCTION

Schlieker et al. (2008) showed that knockdown of URM1 via short hairpin
RNA reduced the growth rate of HeLa cells. Knockdown of URM1 in human
cell lines increased cell size, caused multinucleation, and increased
the population of cells with 4n or more chromosomes, suggesting that
URM1 is required for cytokinesis and thus for orderly cell cycle
progression. Use of a URM1-dependent suicide inhibitor with HEK293 cells
showed that URM1 interacted with ATPBD3 (612694). Biochemical analysis
revealed that the C-terminal thiocarboxylated glycine of URM1 functioned
as a sulfur carrier for the thiolation of tRNAs by ATPBD3. Knockdown of
either URM1 or ATPBD3 in HeLa cells reduced thiolation of uracil in the
anticodon region of tRNA-lys(UUU) (see TRNAK1; 189918).

MAPPING

Hartz (2009) mapped the URM1 gene to chromosome 9q34.11 based on an
alignment of the URM1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK001880) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.1).
