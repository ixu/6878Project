DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The RNA exosome is an approximately 400-kD multimeric ribonucleolytic
complex that participates in both endonucleolytic and 3-prime/5-prime
exonucleolytic activity in RNA processing and in the degradation of a
variety of RNA substrates. DIS3L is a catalytic subunit that has
3-prime/5-prime exonucleolytic activity (summary by Tomecki et al.,
2010).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2001) cloned DIS3L, which they designated
KIAA1955. The transcript contains a repetitive element in its 3-prime
end, and the deduced 947-amino acid protein shares 36% identity with
DIS3 (607533). RT-PCR ELISA detected highest expression in skeletal
muscle. Moderate to high expression was detected in all other adult and
fetal tissues and specific adult brain regions examined.

By searching a human EST database for sequences similar to yeast Dis3,
Tomecki et al. (2010) identified DIS3L. The deduced 1,000-amino acid
protein contains a weak N-terminal PIN-like domain, followed by 2
cold-shock domains, an RNB exonuclease catalytic domain, and a
C-terminal S1 domain. DIS3L localized predominantly to the cytoplasm in
HEK293 and HeLa cells, with exclusion from nucleoli.

By analyzing peptides associated with exosome complexes immunoaffinity
purified from HeLa cells, followed by database analysis and PCR analysis
of a teratocarcinoma cDNA library, Staals et al. (2010) cloned
full-length DIS3L, which they designated DIS3L1. The deduced 1,054-amino
acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 120.8 kD. It has a
poorly conserved N-terminal PIN domain, followed by 2 cold-shock
domains, a putative RNase II-type RNB exonuclease catalytic domain, and
a possible C-terminal S1 RNA-binding domain. Database analysis revealed
3 additional DIS3L1 splice variants. Fluorescence- and epitope-tagged
DIS3L1 and endogenous DIS3L1 localized to the cytoplasm of transfected
human HEP-2 cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Staals et al. (2010) confirmed that fluorescence- or epitope-tagged
DIS3L1 coprecipitated with RRP4 (EXOSC2; 602238) and other exosome
components. Immunopurified DIS3L1 showed Mg(2+)-dependent
exoribonuclease activity and converted substrate RNA into nucleotide
monophosphates. It has no endonuclease activity. Blocking of the 3-prime
end impaired degradation, consistent with 3-prime/5-prime
exoribonuclease activity. Small interfering RNA-mediated depletion of
DIS3L1 reduced exoribonuclease activity from immunopurified exosomes.
Mutation of asp486 within the RNB domain of DIS3L1 abrogated its
ribonuclease activity and resulted in the accumulation of truncated 28S
rRNA fragments.

Tomecki et al. (2010) found that epitope-tagged human DIS3 or DIS3L
coimmunoprecipitated with core exosome subunits from transfected HEK293
cells. Depletion of DIS3L from HeLa cells had no effect on accumulation
of nuclear RNAs, but it contributed to the stabilization of cytoplasmic
MYC (190080) induced by knockdown of DIS3. DIS3L purified from
transfected HEK293 cells showed 3-prime/5-prime exonuclease activity
against single stranded RNA, but showed no endonuclease activity against
a circular RNA substrate. Domain analysis revealed that the RNB domains
of DIS3L conferred exonuclease activity.

MAPPING

Hartz (2011) mapped the DIS3L gene to chromosome 15q22.31 based on an
alignment of the DIS3L sequence (GenBank GENBANK AB075835) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).
