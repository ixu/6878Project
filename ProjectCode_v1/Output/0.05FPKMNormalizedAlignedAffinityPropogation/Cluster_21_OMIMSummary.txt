192225	TITLE *192225 VASCULAR CELL ADHESION MOLECULE 1; VCAM1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, a cell surface glycoprotein expressed
by cytokine-activated endothelium, mediates the adhesion of monocytes
and lymphocytes (Cybulsky et al., 1991). In inflammatory conditions and
in cardiac allografts undergoing rejection, VCAM1 is upregulated in
endothelium of postcapillary venules. Arterial expression of VCAM1 is
also found in experimental models of atherosclerosis in the rabbit.

GENE STRUCTURE

Cybulsky et al. (1991) demonstrated that VCAM1 is present in single copy
in the human genome and contains 9 exons spanning about 25 kb of DNA. At
least 2 different VCAM1 precursors can be generated from the human gene
as a result of alternative mRNA splicing events, which include or
exclude exon 5.

MAPPING

Cybulsky et al. (1991) mapped the VCAM1 gene to chromosome 1 by Southern
analysis of somatic cell hybrids. A study of 2 hybrid lines carrying
translocations involving chromosome 1 permitted regionalization to
1p34-p21. Fluorescence in situ hybridization to metaphase chromosomes
further narrowed the localization to 1p32-p31. (Another endothelial
leukocyte adhesion molecule, ELAM1 (131210), is located on chromosome 1,
but on the long arm.)

Kumar et al. (1994) mapped the murine Vcam1 gene to chromosome 3 near
Amy1.

GENE FUNCTION

In a review of molecular pathways controlling heart development, Olson
and Srivastava (1996) cited studies indicating that deficiencies of the
cell adhesion molecules VCAM and alpha-4 integrin (192975) result in
epicardial dissolution and subsequent myocardial thinning.

Lu and Cyster (2002) studied the mechanisms that control localization of
marginal zone B cells. They demonstrated that marginal zone B cells
express elevated levels of the integrins LFA1 (see 153370/600065) and
alpha-4 (192975)-beta-1 (135630), and that the marginal zone B cells
bind to the ligands ICAM1 (147840) and VCAM1. These ligands are
expressed within the marginal zone in a lymphotoxin-dependent manner.
Combined inhibition of LFA1 and alpha-4-beta-1 causes a rapid and
selective release of B cells from the marginal zone. Furthermore,
lipopolysaccharide-triggered marginal zone B cell relocalization
involves downregulation of integrin-mediated adhesion. Lu and Cyster
(2002) concluded that their studies identified key requirements for
marginal zone B cell localization and established a role for integrins
in peripheral lymphoid tissue compartmentalization.

Garmy-Susini et al. (2005) demonstrated that integrin alpha-4-beta-1 and
VCAM1 are expressed by proliferating but not quiescent endothelial cells
and mural cells, respectively. Antagonists of this integrin-ligand pair
blocked the adhesion of mural cells to proliferating endothelia in vitro
and in vivo, thereby inducing apoptosis of endothelial cells and
pericytes and inhibiting neovascularization. Garmy-Susini et al. (2005)
concluded that integrin alpha-4-beta-1 and VCAM1 facilitate a critical
cell-cell adhesion event required for survival of endothelial and mural
cells during vascularization.

Garrison et al. (2005) described cotransin, a small molecule that
inhibits protein translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum. Cotransin
acts in a signal-sequence-discriminatory manner to prevent the stable
insertion of select nascent chains (specifically VCAM1, and P-selectin,
173610) into the Sec61 translocation channel. Garrison et al. (2005)
concluded that the range of substrates accommodated by the channel can
be specifically and reversibly modulated by a cell-permeable small
molecule that alters the interaction between signal sequences and the
Sec61 complex. This has various implications for drug development.

Besemer et al. (2005) developed a very similar VCAM1 depressing agent,
which they called CAM741. CAM741 works similar to cotransin in that it
represses the biosynthesis of VCAM1 cells by blocking the process of
cotranslational translocation, which is dependent on the signal peptide
of VCAM1. CAM741 does not inhibit targeting of the VCAM1 nascent chains
to the translocon channel but prevents translocation to the luminal side
of the endoplasmic reticulum through a process that involves the
translocon component Sec61-beta (609214). Consequently, the VCAM1
precursor protein is synthesized towards the cytosolic compartment of
the cells, where it is degraded.

By in vivo selection, transcriptomic analysis, functional verification,
and clinical validation, Minn et al. (2005) identified a set of genes
that marks and mediates breast cancer metastasis to the lungs. Some of
these genes serve dual functions, providing growth advantages both in
the primary tumor and in the lung microenvironment. Others contribute to
aggressive growth selectivity in the lung. Among the lung metastasis
signature genes identified, several, including VCAM1, were functionally
validated. Those subjects expressing the lung metastasis signature had a
significantly poorer lung metastasis-free survival, but not bone
metastasis-free survival, compared to subjects without the signature.

Campbell et al. (2006) found that increased serum levels of soluble
VCAM1 predicted recurrent ischemic stroke (601367) in a study of 252
patients. A smaller but similar trend was noted for serum levels of
N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NPPB; 600295). Patients in
the highest quarters for both sVCAM1 and NT-proBNP levels had 3.6 times
the risk of recurrent ischemic stroke compared to patients in the lowest
quarters for both biologic markers.

By database analysis, Harris et al. (2008) identified a potential target
sequence for miR126 (MIRN126; 611767), a microRNA selectively expressed
in endothelial cells, in the 3-prime UTR of VCAM1. Transfection of human
endothelial cells with antisense miR126 permitted an increase in
TNF-alpha (TNF; 191160)-stimulated VCAM1 expression. Conversely,
overexpression of the miR126 precursor increased miR126 levels and
decreased VCAM1 expression. Decreasing endogenous miR126 levels
increased leukocyte adherence to endothelial cells. Harris et al. (2008)
concluded that miR126 inhibits VCAM1 expression.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Taylor et al. (2002) identified 33 SNPs in the VCAM1 locus. They then
analyzed a subset of these SNPs in 51 cases of stroke in sickle cell
disease (603903) patients derived from a single institution in Jamaica
and in 51 matched controls. They found that the C variant allele of the
nonsynonymous SNP 1238G-C, which results in a gly413-to-ala amino acid
change (G413A), may be associated with protection from stroke (odds
ratio = 0.35). Dover (2002) stated that sickle cell disease is not a
single gene disorder and emphasized the need for further studies of the
relationship of VCAM1 to strokes in this disorder.

Idelman et al. (2007) stated that VCAM1 transcription induction is
highly dependent on cell and organ type and mode of stimulation by
various transcription factors. The authors identified 8 VCAM1 promoter
haplotypes comprising 13 SNPs previously identified by Taylor et al.
(2002) in African Americans. Functional cellular expression studies in T
cells stimulated by T-cell mitogens assessed the inducibility of
expression of the different haplotypes. A -540A-G SNP (dbSNP rs3783605)
was found to gain an ETS2 (164740)-binding site, which was postulated by
Idelman et al. (2007) to have functional importance.

601002	TITLE *601002 GLUTATHIONE SYNTHETASE; GSS
;;GSHS
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Glutathione (GSH), a ubiquitous low molecular mass thiol, is important
for a variety of biologic functions, including protection of cells from
oxidative damage by free radicals, detoxification of xenobiotics, and
membrane transport (Meister and Anderson, 1983; Uhlig and Wendel, 1992).
The consecutive actions of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (606857)
and glutathione synthetase produce GSH from the amino acids cysteine,
glutamate, and glycine.

CLONING

Shi et al. (1996) cloned and characterized the human GSS gene.

MAPPING

Webb et al. (1995) found by Southern blots hybridized with a glutathione
synthetase cDNA that there appears to be a single glutathione synthetase
gene (GSS) in the human genome. Analysis of somatic cell hybrids showed
that GSS is located on chromosome 20, and this assignment was refined to
20q11.2 by fluorescence in situ hybridization.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Shi et al. (1996) performed a mutation search of the GSS gene in 3
families with glutathione synthetase deficiency (GSSD; 266130), or
5-oxoprolinuria, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized, in its
severe form, by massive urinary excretion of 5-oxoproline, metabolic
acidosis, hemolytic anemia, and central nervous system damage. They
identified 7 mutations at the GSS locus on 6 alleles: 1 splice site
mutation, 2 deletions, and 4 missense mutations
(601002.0001-601002.0006). Bacterial expression and yeast
complementation assays of the cDNAs encoded by these alleles
demonstrated their functional defects. They also identified a homozygous
missense mutation in the GSS gene (601002.0007) in an individual
affected by the milder form of GSS deficiency, which is apparently
restricted to erythrocytes and only associated with hemolytic anemia
(GSSDE; 231900).

Dahl et al. (1997) identified a total of 13 different mutations in the
GSS gene in 9 patients with severe glutathione synthetase deficiency.
The patients were all unrelated and came from different geographic
areas. All patients had presented with metabolic acidosis, hemolytic
anemia, and 5-oxoprolinuria; however, neurologic symptoms were variable.
Among the 13 different missense mutations involved, 2 were found in
patients presenting with functional impairment of the central nervous
system. One of these, aged 22 years at last examination, had a low
normal IQ and abnormal retinogram. Four patients were found to be
compound heterozygotes and 2 were apparently homozygous. Reduced enzyme
activities were demonstrated in recombinant protein expressed from cDNAs
in 4 cases with different missense mutations. The results from
biochemical analysis of patient specimens, supported by the properties
of the expressed mutant proteins, indicated that residual activity was
present in affected individuals. Dahl et al. (1997) suggested that
complete loss of function of both glutathione synthetase alleles is
probably lethal. They postulated that missense mutations will account
for the phenotype in most patients with severe GS deficiency.

In 41 patients (33 previously reported) with glutathione synthetase
deficiency from 33 families, Njalsson et al. (2005) evaluated genotype,
enzyme activity, metabolite levels, and clinical phenotype. They
identified 27 different mutations; 23 patients were homozygotes and 18
were compound heterozygotes. The moderate and severe clinical phenotypes
could not be distinguished based on enzyme activity or glutathione or
gamma-glutamylcysteine levels in cultured fibroblasts. All mutations
causing frameshifts, premature stop codons, or aberrant splicing were
associated with moderate or severe clinical phenotypes. Njalsson et al.
(2005) concluded that additional genetic or environmental factors modify
at least the moderate and severe phenotypes and that the clinical
classification given to patients may be influenced by variation in
follow-up.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
GLUTATHIONE SYNTHETASE DEFICIENCY
GSS, ARG164GLN

In a family in which 2 brothers exhibited 5-oxoprolinuria (GSSD;
266130), metabolic acidosis, hemolytic anemia, and mental retardation,
Shi et al. (1996) found compound heterozygosity for mutations in the GSS
gene: a G-to-A transition at the end of exon 4 (position 491) of the
cDNA, which may cause an RNA splicing error or a missense mutation
(arg164-to-gln); and, in exon 1, a deletion of G corresponding to
nucleotide 3 or 4 in the cDNA sequence (+1ATGGCC...), predicting a
frameshift and/or abolition of the translation initiation site. These 2
changes were designated as 491G-A and 3(4)delG, respectively.

.0002
GLUTATHIONE SYNTHETASE DEFICIENCY
GSS, 1-BP DEL, NT3/4G

See 601002.0001 and Shi et al. (1996).

.0003
GLUTATHIONE SYNTHETASE DEFICIENCY
GSS, ARG267TRP

In a patient with 5-oxoprolinuria (266130), Shi et al. (1996) found
compound heterozygosity for 2 C-to-T transitions at nucleotides 799 and
847, implying 2 missense mutations: arg267 to trp and arg283 to cys
(601002.0004) in exons 8 and 9, respectively.

.0004
GLUTATHIONE SYNTHETASE DEFICIENCY
GSS, ARG283CYS

See 601002.0003 and Shi et al. (1996).

.0005
GLUTATHIONE SYNTHETASE DEFICIENCY
GSS, ARG125CYS

In a patient with 5-oxoprolinuria (266130), Shi et al. (1996) found 3
sequence alterations: 2 missense mutations (373C-T, leading to arg125 to
cys, and 941C-T, leading to pro314 to leu) plus a 6-bp in-frame deletion
(1137del6, resulting in the deletion of val380 and gln381) in exons 4,
9, and 11, respectively. The arg125-to-cys mutation was transmitted from
the father; the other 2 mutations came from the mother, indicating that
they are on the same allele (601002.0006). In an in vitro expression
system, the mutant cDNAs corresponding to the 2 alleles from this family
failed to complement and produced proteins with undetectable activity
(373C-T) or altered solubility (doubly mutant allele).

.0006
GLUTATHIONE SYNTHETASE DEFICIENCY
GSS, PRO314LEU AND 6-BP DEL, NT1137

See 601002.0005 and Shi et al. (1996).

.0007
GLUTATHIONE SYNTHETASE DEFICIENCY OF ERYTHROCYTES, HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA
DUE TO
GSS, ASP219GLY

In a patient with GSS deficiency restricted to erythrocytes and
associated only with hemolytic anemia (GSSDE; 231900) (Mohler et al.,
1970), Shi et al. (1996) found homozygosity for the nucleotide
substitution 656A-G that resulted in the missense mutation asp219 to gly
(D219G). Although the patient's parents were not related, they were both
of Scottish descent, and the families had lived in the same county for
several generations. The allele was responsible for reduced activity and
instability of the expressed protein, but was more active than the other
6 alleles which were found by Shi et al. (1996) to result in
5-oxoprolinuria.

Vives Corrons et al. (2001) found the D219G mutation in 2 unrelated
Spanish adults with a well-compensated hemolytic syndrome without anemia
or splenomegaly at steady state. One of these patients was diagnosed
after an episode of acute hemolytic anemia following fava bean
ingestion.

;;SEMAPHORIN L; SEMAL;;
SEMAPHORIN K1; SEMAK1;;
CDW108
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SEMA7A is an 80-kD membrane-bound semaphorin that associates with cell
surfaces via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) linkage. It is
preferentially expressed on activated lymphocytes and erythrocytes.
SEMA7A carries the John Milton Hagen (JMH) blood group antigens (see
614745) (summary by Yamada et al., 1999).

CLONING

By PCR using primers designed from alcelaphine herpesvirus-1 (AHV) sema,
followed by 5-prime and 3-prime RACE, Lange et al. (1998) cloned
full-length SEMA7A, which they designated SEMAL, from a placenta cDNA
library. The deduced 666-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular
mass of about 75 kD, and the unglycosylated protein has a calculated
molecular mass of about 70 kD following signal peptide cleavage. SEMA7A
contains a 44-amino acid N-terminal signal sequence, a semaphorin domain
of about 500 amino acids, an immunoglobulin-like motif, and a C-terminal
hydrophobic domain that lacks a significant intracellular tail. The
semaphorin domain has several conserved cysteine residues and an RGD
motif. SEMA7A also contains 5 N-glycosylation sites and several
myristoylation sites. Northern blot analysis detected a 3.2-kb
transcript expressed predominantly in spleen, thymus, testis, and ovary.
Little or no expression was detected in prostate, small intestine,
colon, and peripheral blood leukocytes. RNA dot blot analysis detected
expression in placenta, spleen, and gonadal tissue, but not in neuronal
or muscular tissue.

By searching an EST database using AHV sema as probe, Xu et al. (1998)
identified SEMA7A, which they designated SEMAK1. SEMA7A shares about 50%
amino acid identity with AHV sema and less than 30% identity with other
semaphorins. Northern blot analysis of adult mouse tissues detected a
4.4-kb Sema7a transcript expressed at high levels in brain, spinal cord,
lung, and testis. In situ hybridization detected weak but dynamic
expression of Sema7a in spinal cord, cerebellum, and cortex during
embryonic development. In adult mice, Sema7a was expressed in several
brain structures and cell layers.

By PCR using primers based on the N-terminal amino acid sequence of
SEMA7A, followed by screening a leukemic T-cell line cDNA library and a
placenta cDNA library, Yamada et al. (1999) cloned SEMA7A, which they
called CDW108. Northern blot analysis detected a 3.5-kb transcript
expressed at highest levels in placenta, testis, and spleen, with low
levels in brain and thymus. Yamada et al. (1999) detected 5
differentially glycosylated forms of SEMA7A by SDS-PAGE of a transfected
esophageal cancer cell line. The largest protein had an apparent
molecular mass of about 80 kD. Treatment with peptide-N-glycosidase
revealed a deglycosylated protein with an apparent molecular mass of
about 65 kD.

Sato and Takahashi (1998) cloned mouse Sema7a. They noted that the
immunoglobulin-like domain of the deduced 664-amino acid protein is of
the C2 type. Human and mouse SEMA7A share 89.5% identity. Northern blot
analysis of rat tissues detected highest expression in the nervous
system, and expression in the cerebellum and brain stem increased during
development. Moderate expression was detected in thymus and spleen.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lange et al. (1998) determined that the SEMA7A gene contains at least 13
exons and spans about 9 kb.

Seltsam et al. (2007) stated that the SEMA7A gene contains 14 exons.

MAPPING

By FISH, Lange et al. (1998) mapped the SEMA7A gene to chromosome
15q22.2-q23. Using radiation hybrid analysis, Yamada et al. (1999)
mapped the SEMA7A gene to chromosome 15q23-q24.

Lange et al. (1998) mapped the mouse Sema7a gene to chromosome 9A3.3-B.

GENE FUNCTION

Xu et al. (1998) demonstrated that SEMA7A is a GPI-anchored membrane
protein. SEMA7A was expressed on the cell surface of transfected COS-7
cells, and treatment with phospholipase C (see 600220) released the
protein from the cell surface. A soluble mutant of SEMA7A bound to
macrophage and mast cell lines, but it did not bind to COS-7 cells
expressing neuropilin-1 (602069) or neuropilin-2 (602070), receptors for
several secreted semaphorins. Xu et al. (1998) concluded that these
macrophage and mast cell lines contain a specific receptor for SEMA7A.

Pasterkamp et al. (2003) showed that semaphorin 7A, a membrane-anchored
member of the semaphorin family of guidance proteins known for its
immunomodulatory effects, can also mediate neuronal functions.
Pasterkamp et al. (2003) showed that unlike many other semaphorins,
which act as repulsive guidance cues, SEMA7A enhances central and
peripheral axon growth and is required for proper axon tract formation
during embryonic development. Unexpectedly, SEMA7A enhancement of axon
outgrowth requires integrin receptors and activation of MAPK signaling
pathways. Pasterkamp et al. (2003) concluded that their findings defined
a theretofore unknown biologic function for semaphorins, identified an
unexpected role for integrins and integrin-dependent intracellular
signaling in mediating semaphorin responses, and provided a framework
for understanding and interfering with SEMA7A function in both immune
and nervous systems. Pasterkamp et al. (2003) showed that
SEMA7A-mediated axon growth is plexin C1 (604259)-independent.

Suzuki et al. (2007) demonstrated that SEMA7A, which is expressed on
activated T cells, stimulates cytokine production in monocytes and
macrophages through alpha-1-beta-1 integrin (192968, 135630) (also known
as very late antigen-1) as a component of the immunologic synapse, and
is critical for the effector phase of the inflammatory immune response.
Sema7A-null mice are defective in cell-mediated immune responses such as
contact hypersensitivity and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.
Although antigen-specific and cytokine-producing effector T cells could
develop and migrate into antigen-challenged sites in Sema7a-null mice,
Sema7a-null T cells failed to induce contact hypersensitivity even when
directly injected into the antigen-challenged sites. Thus, Suzuki et al.
(2007) concluded that the interaction between SEMA7A and alpha-1-beta-1
integrin is crucial at the site of inflammation.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Association with Bone Mineral Density

Koh et al. (2006) genotyped 5 polymorphisms of the SEMA7A gene in 560
postmenopausal Korean women and measured bone mineral density (BMD; see
601884) of the lumbar spine and proximal femur. The SEMA7A polymorphisms
15775C-G (dbSNP rs2072649) and 22331A-G (dbSNP rs741761) were associated
with a low BMD of the femoral neck and lumbar spine (p = 0.02 and 0.04,
respectively) in a recessive model. A haplotype based on the 5 SNPs,
so-called ht4, was associated with risk of vertebral fracture (OR = 1.87
and 1.93, p = 0.03 and 0.02, in dominant and codominant models,
respectively). Koh et al. (2006) suggested that variations in SEMA7A may
play a role in decreased BMD and risk of vertebral fracture.

- John Milton Hagen Blood Group System: JMH-Variant Phenotype

In 5 unrelated individuals with JMH-variant phenotype (see 614745) from
5 different countries, Seltsam et al. (2007) identified 4 missense
mutations in the SEMA7A gene (607961.0001-607961.0004). These mutations
were not detected in genomic DNA from 100 randomly selected individuals
from Northern Germany. All 4 missense mutations occurred in the
semaphorin domain of SEMA7A.

ANIMAL MODEL

Czopik et al. (2006) found that T cells from immunized Sema7a -/- mice
had increased proliferative responses to antigen that were not
attributable to Sema7a deficiency on macrophages or dendritic cells.
Sema7a -/- mice were prone to die at the onset of experimental
autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and had higher clinical EAE scores
compared with wildtype littermates. Delayed-type hypersensitivity
responses were also enhanced in Sema7a -/- mice. Czopik et al. (2006)
concluded that SEMA7A plays an important T cell-intrinsic inhibitory
role and is essential in limiting T cell-mediated autoimmunity.

with the R347L variant form.

604677	TITLE *604677 COLLAGEN, TYPE IV, ALPHA-3 BINDING PROTEIN; COL4A3BP
;;GOODPASTURE ANTIGEN-BINDING PROTEIN; GPBP
DESCRIPTION In patients with Goodpasture syndrome (233450), autoantibodies against
the noncollagenous C-terminal domain (NC1) of the alpha-3 chain of
collagen IV, or Goodpasture antigen (COL4A3; 120070), cause a rapid
glomerulonephritis and often lung hemorrhage. The N terminus of the
alpha-3 chain of humans is highly divergent from that of other species
as well as from the other 5 alpha(IV) chains and contains a unique
5-amino acid motif, KGRDS. The motif conforms to a functional
phosphorylation site for type A protein kinases. In addition, COL4A3 has
a number of splice variants, the presence of which upregulates
phosphorylation of the N terminus of the Goodpasture antigen.

By screening multiple cDNA libraries for proteins interacting with the
divergent region of the Goodpasture antigen, Raya et al. (1999)
identified a HeLa cell cDNA encoding a deduced 624-amino acid protein,
designated COL4A3BP. Raya et al. (1999) termed the protein GPBP (for
Goodpasture antigen-binding protein). Sequence analysis revealed that
18% of the GPBP residues are phosphorylatable and 16% are acidic. Serine
residues comprise 9% of the protein, but in 2 regions account for 40% of
the amino acids. There is also a pleckstrin homology domain at the N
terminus. Northern blot analysis revealed expression of 2 major
transcripts of approximately 4.4 and 7.5 kb. Expression is highest in
skeletal muscle and heart muscle, moderate in brain, placenta, kidney,
and pancreas, and lowest in lung and liver. Immunoblot analysis revealed
an 80- to 89-kD antigen, suggesting differential posttranslational
modifications. Affinity purification and kinase renaturation assays
defined GPBP as a novel nonconventional serine/threonine kinase.
Immunohistochemistry showed diffuse, predominantly cytosolic staining of
specific cell types in numerous tissues, many of which are targets of
autoimmune responses.

Ceramide is synthesized at the endoplasmic reticulum and translocated to
the Golgi compartment for conversion to sphingomyelin. The main pathway
of ceramide transport to the Golgi is genetically impaired in a
mammalian mutant cell line, LY-A. Hanada et al. (2003) identified CERT
as a splicing variant of the Goodpasture antigen-binding protein
(GPBP-delta26). GPBP was initially identified as a protein that could
bind a carboxy-terminal noncollagenous region of human collagen alpha3
(IV) chain in a cell-free system. GPBP-delta26, which has 26 fewer amino
acid residues than GPBP, is a more common isoform and is expressed
widely in various tissues, although its expression varies according to
the cell type. Both GPBPs are hydrophilic cytoplasmic proteins, which
conflicts with their proposed pathologic role in the phosphorylation of
extracellular collagen. CERT is a cytoplasmic protein with a
phosphatidylinositol-4-monophosphate-binding domain and a putative
domain for catalyzing lipid transfer. In vitro assays showed that this
lipid transfer-catalyzing domain specifically extracts ceramide from
phospholipid bilayers. CERT expressed in LY-A cells has an amino acid
substitution that destroys its
phosphatidylinositol-4-monophosphate-binding activity, thereby impairing
its Golgi targeting function. Hanada et al. (2003) concluded that CERT
mediates intracellular trafficking of ceramide in a nonvesicular manner.

MITOGEN-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE 1C; MAPKAPK1C;;
MAPKAP KINASE 1C
DESCRIPTION Serine/threonine protein kinases in the ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) family
have been implicated as signaling intermediates in the cellular response
to several growth factors. Moller et al. (1994) described the cloning
and characterization of 3 genes encoding 3 isoforms of ribosomal protein
S6 kinase, which they called HU1 (RPS6KA1; 601684), HU2 (RPS6KA2), and
HU3 (RPS6KA3; 300075). The partial HU2 cDNA (GenBank GENBANK L07598)
encodes a predicted protein containing 2 distinct consensus ATP-binding
site sequences. Northern blot and RNase protection analyses detected
major 7.5-kb and minor 3.5-kb HU2 transcripts in fibroblasts, skeletal
muscle, lymphocytes, and placenta.

Zhao et al. (1995) cloned a full-length cDNA encoding the RPS6KA2
isoform of ribosomal protein S6 kinase, which they designated RSK3. The
deduced 733-amino acid RSK3 protein has 84% and 75% sequence identity
with RSK2 (RPS6KA3) and RSK1 (RPS6KA1), respectively. RSK3 has a unique
N-terminal sequence which contains a putative bipartite nuclear
localization signal. Immunoblot analysis of human cell lysates detected
an 83-kD RSK protein. The authors demonstrated serum-stimulated nuclear
translocation of endogenous RSK3 in HeLa cells. RSK3 exhibited
growth-stimulated autophosphorylation and kinase activity; however, its
relative activity toward several known RSK substrates differed from the
activities of other RSKs. Unlike RSK1, RSK3 was not activated by ERK2
(PRKM1; 176948) in vitro. Northern blot analysis detected a single
6.5-kb RSK3 transcript in all tissues examined, with the highest
expression in lung and skeletal muscle.

Goustin (1998) reported that the RSK3 gene (GenBank GENBANK Z98049,
GENBANK AL022069) contains 217,693 bp from the transcriptional start
site to the polyadenylation signal. The gene has 21 exons, with an
88.1-kb intron between exons 1 and 2.

By analysis of somatic cell hybrids, Moller et al. (1994) mapped the
RPS6KA2 gene to chromosome 6. Zhao et al. (1995) refined the mapping to
6q27 by fluorescence in situ hybridization.

Zeniou et al. (2002) determined the expression of the RSK1, RSK2, and
RSK3 genes in various human tissues, during mouse embryogenesis, and in
mouse brain. The 3 RSK mRNAs were expressed in all human tissues and
brain regions tested, supporting functional redundancy. However,
tissue-specific variations in levels suggested that the proteins may
also serve specific roles. The mouse Rsk3 gene was prominently expressed
in the developing neural and sensory tissues, whereas Rsk1 gene
expression was the strongest in various other tissues with high
proliferative activity, suggesting distinct roles during development. In
adult mouse brain, the highest levels of Rsk2 expression were observed
in regions with high synaptic activity, including the neocortex, the
hippocampus, and Purkinje cells. The authors suggested that in these
areas, which are essential to cognitive function and learning, the RSK1
and RSK3 genes may not be able to fully compensate for a lack of RSK2
function.

;;DAG;;
DYSTROGLYCAN, ALPHA;;
AGRIN RECEPTOR; AGRNR
DYSTROGLYCAN, BETA, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The DAG1 gene encodes 2 dystroglycan proteins, both of which are
dystrophin-associated glycoproteins (DAGs). Dystrophin (DMD; 300377), a
large skeletal muscle protein localized to the inner surface of the
sarcolemma, is tightly linked to a large complex of glycoproteins that
comprise the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC). Alpha- and
beta-dystroglycan are parts of the DGC (Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya et al.,
1992).

Beta-dystroglycan is an integral membrane protein, whereas
alpha-dystroglycan is membrane-associated through its noncovalent
interaction with the extracellular domain of beta-dystroglycan. The
alpha- and beta-dystroglycans provide important physical linkages
between components of basement membranes and cytoplasmic proteins that
bind to the actin cytoskeleton (Spear, 1998).

CLONING

Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya et al. (1992) demonstrated that the transmembrane
43-kD and extracellular 156-kD DAG proteins are encoded by a single
5.8-kb mRNA. The deduced 895-residue precursor protein has a molecular
mass of 96 kD and undergoes posttranslational processing to generate a
43-kD transmembrane protein and a 156-kD extracellular protein. The
predicted amino acid sequence of human and rabbit dystroglycan are 93%
identical, with predicted glycosylation sites being conserved. Both
dystroglycan proteins were expressed in a variety of fetal and adult
tissues. The muscle and nonmuscle isoforms of dystroglycan differ by
carbohydrate moieties but not protein sequence.

GENE STRUCTURE

The coding sequence of the DAG1 gene is organized into 2 exons,
separated by a large intron (Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya et al., 1993).

MAPPING

Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya et al. (1992, 1993) mapped the DAG gene to
chromosome 3 by Southern blot analysis of human/Chinese hamster somatic
cell hybrid DNAs. The regional assignment to 3p21 was confirmed and
further refined by fluorescence in situ hybridization.

Gorecki et al. (1994) demonstrated that the Dag1 gene is located on
mouse chromosome 9 in a region of conserved synteny with human 3p. The
location was consistent with a possibility that dystroglycan mutations
are involved in either of 2 mouse neurologic mutations, 'ducky' (du) or
'tippy' (tip).

GENE FUNCTION

Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya et al. (1992) demonstrated that the extracellular
156-kD DAG binds laminin, and thus may provide linkage between the
sarcolemma and extracellular matrix (ECM).

Agrin (103320) is a component of the synaptic basal lamina which induces
the aggregation of acetylcholine receptors and other elements of the
postsynaptic membrane. Ma et al. (1993) determined the localization,
binding characteristics, and biochemical profile of the agrin receptor
in Torpedo electric organ membranes and defined domains of agrin that
bind this receptor. Campanelli et al. (1994) and Gee et al. (1994)
presented evidence that the alpha-dystrophin-associated glycoprotein
functions as an agrin receptor. Utrophin (128240) colocalizes with
agrin-induced acetylcholine receptor clusters. Agrin may function by
initiating or stabilizing a synapse-specific membrane cytoskeleton that
in turn serves as a scaffold upon which synaptic molecules are
concentrated. Sealock and Froehner (1994) reviewed the evidence that
alpha-dystroglycan is an agrin-binding protein and the functional
implications of this.

Yamada et al. (1996) showed that dystroglycan is a dual receptor for
agrin and laminin-2 in the Schwann cell membrane. Laminin-2 is composed
of the alpha-2 (156225), beta-1 (150240), and gamma-1 (150290) laminin
chains.

Rambukkana et al. (1998) showed that alpha-DG serves as a Schwann cell
receptor for Mycobacterium leprae, the causative organism of leprosy.
They found that M. leprae specifically binds to alpha-DG only in the
presence of the G domain of the alpha-2 chain of laminin-2. Native
alpha-DG competitively inhibited the laminin-2-mediated M. leprae
binding to primary Schwann cells. Thus, M. leprae may use linkage
between the extracellular matrix and the cytoskeleton through laminin-2
and alpha-DG for its interaction with Schwann cells. The neuropathy of
leprosy is caused, in part, by invasion of peripheral nerves by M.
leprae. The Schwann cell is an important target for bacterial invasion.
In the endoneurium of peripheral nerves, Schwann cells are covered by
basal lamina, composed of laminin, type IV collagen, entactin/nidogen,
and heparan sulfate proteoglycans. Similarly, Cao et al. (1998) found
that alpha-DG serves as a receptor for lymphocytic choriomeningitis
virus (LCMV) and for Lassa fever virus (LFV). They purified a peripheral
membrane protein that is interactive with LCMV from cells permissive to
infection by this virus. Tryptic peptides from this protein were
determined to be alpha-DG. Several strains of LCMV and other
arenaviruses, including LFV, Oliveros, and Mobala, bound to purified
alpha-DG protein. Soluble alpha-DG blocked both LCMV and LFV infection.
Cells bearing a null mutation of the gene encoding DG were resistant to
LCMV infection, and reconstitution of DG expression in null mutant cells
restored susceptibility to LCMV infection. Thus, alpha-DG is a cellular
receptor for both LCMV and LFV.

Spence et al. (2004) localized beta-dystroglycan to microvilli
structures in a number of cell types where it associated with the
cytoskeletal adaptor ezrin (VIL2; 123900), through which it was able to
modulate the actin cytoskeleton and induced peripheral filopodia and
microvilli. Ezrin was able to interact with dystroglycan through a
cluster of basic residues in the juxtamembrane region of dystroglycan,
and mutation of these residues both prevented ezrin binding and the
induction of actin-rich surface protrusions.

Wright et al. (2012) found that mouse dystroglycan bound directly to the
laminin G domain of the axonal guidance molecule Slit (see SLIT1,
603742) in a calcium-dependent manner. Binding to dystroglycan was
required for proper Slit localization within the basement membrane and
floor plate, and for development of normal commissural axon guidance
tracts. Mutations in mouse Ispd (614631) or B3gnt1 (605517) that
disrupted dystroglycan glycosylation resulted in similar abnormalities
in axonal pathfinding.

- Role in Muscular Dystrophy

Abnormal glycosylation of DAG1 results in several forms of congenital
muscular dystrophy that range phenotypically from severe forms with
brain and eye anomalies (see, e.g., MDDGA1; 236670) to milder
limb-girdle types (see, e.g., MDDGC1; 609308). Mutations in 6 different
genes involved in glycosylation of DAG1 have been identified; these
genes include POMT1 (607423), POMT2 (607439), POMGNT1 (606822), FKTN
(607440), FKRP (606596), and LARGE (603590). These disorders are
collectively known as 'dystroglycanopathies' (Godfrey et al., 2007).

Matsumura et al. (1993) demonstrated deficient expression of multiple
dystrophin-associated glycoproteins in a form of congenital muscular
dystrophy due to mutation in the FKTN gene (607440). This form of
congenital muscular dystrophy, also known as Fukuyama-type congenital
muscular dystrophy (FCMD) or muscular dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy with
brain and eye anomalies (type A4; MDDGA4; 253800) is characterized by
defective glycosylation of DAG1. Matsumura et al. (1993) noted that the
156DAG/43DAG proteins are expressed in both muscle and brain.

Arahata et al. (1993) found preservation of immunostaining for 43DAG in
FCMD at the plasma membrane of the muscle fibers. On the other hand,
they found reduced laminin M (or merosin (156225), a striated
muscle-specific basal-lamina-associated protein) in most muscle fibers
of FCMD, suggesting that it may have an early or primary role in the
pathogenesis of the disorder.

Matsumura et al. (1993) showed that truncation of the dystrophin
molecule with loss of the C-terminal domains can lead to severe muscular
dystrophy, even when truncated dystrophin is demonstrable in the
subsarcolemmal cytoskeleton. This is because the C-terminal domains are
involved in the interaction with the large oligomeric complex of
sarcolemmal glycoproteins, including dystroglycan.

Tinsley et al. (1994) reviewed the 'increasing complexity of the
dystrophin-associated protein complex.' Although the exact function of
dystrophin remained to be determined, analysis of its interaction with
this large oligomeric protein complex at the sarcolemma and the
identification of a structurally related protein, utrophin (128240),
were leading to the identification of candidate genes for various
neuromuscular disorders.

As reviewed by Spear (1998), structural integrity of the sarcolemma in
skeletal and cardiac muscle appears to depend in part on binding of the
cytoplasmic protein dystrophin to both actin and the cytoplasmic tail of
beta-dystroglycan, and binding of alpha-dystroglycan to laminin-2 in the
basal lamina. Laminins are composed of 3 polypeptide chains designated
alpha, beta, and gamma. The multiple isoforms of laminin differ in their
constituent chains. Laminin-2 is composed of alpha-2, beta-1, and
gamma-1. Homozygous deletion of the gene encoding dystroglycan is lethal
at the embryonic stage in mice (Williamson et al., 1997) and would
presumably also be lethal in humans.

Yamada et al. (2001) demonstrated that a 30-kD fragment of
beta-dystroglycan is the product of proteolytic processing of the
extracellular domain of beta-dystroglycan by the membrane-associated
matrix metalloproteinase (MMP2; 120360). This processing disintegrates
the dystroglycan complex and disrupts this particular link between the
ECM and cell membrane. The authors proposed that this processing of
beta-dystroglycan may play a crucial role in the molecular pathogenesis
of sarcoglycanopathy.

Using PCR, immunohistochemistry, and immunoblotting to analyze samples
from patients with Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy, Hayashi et
al. (2001) confirmed a deficiency of fukutin (FKTN; 607440) and found
marked deficiency of highly glycosylated DAG1 in skeletal and cardiac
muscle and reduced amounts of DAG1 in brain tissue. Beta-dystroglycan
was normal in all tissues examined. These findings supported the
suggestion that fukutin deficiency affects the modification of
glycosylation of DAG1, which then cannot localize or function properly
and may be degraded or eluted from the extracellular surface membrane of
the muscle fiber. Hayashi et al. (2001) concluded that this disruption
underlies the developmental, structural, and functional damage to
muscles in patients with FCMD.

Using transfection experiments, Esapa et al. (2002) determined that
fukutin and fukutin-related protein (FKRP; 606596) are targeted to the
medial Golgi apparatus through their N termini and transmembrane
domains. Overexpression of FKRP in CHO cells altered the
posttranslational processing of alpha- and beta-dystroglycan, thus
inhibiting maturation of the 2 isoforms. Mutations in the DxD motif or
in the Golgi-targeting sequence, which cause inefficient trafficking of
FKRP to the Golgi apparatus, did not alter dystroglycan processing in
vitro. The pro448-to-leu mutation in FKRP (P448L; 606596.0003) resulted
in mislocalization of the mutant protein and disruption in dystroglycan
processing. Esapa et al. (2002) concluded that FKRP is required for the
posttranslational modification of dystroglycan. They suggested that
aberrant processing of dystroglycan caused by a mislocalized FKRP mutant
could be a novel mechanism that causes congenital muscular dystrophy.

Kanagawa et al. (2004) showed that both the N-terminal domain and a
portion of the mucin-like domain of alpha-dystroglycan are essential for
high-affinity laminin receptor function. They found that
posttranslational modification of alpha-dystroglycan by LARGE (603590)
occurs within the mucin-like domain, but the N-terminal domain interacts
with LARGE, defining an intracellular enzyme-substrate recognition motif
necessary to initiate functional glycosylation. Gene replacement in
dystroglycan-deficient muscle demonstrated that the dystroglycan
C-terminal domain is sufficient only for dystrophin-glycoprotein complex
assembly. To prevent muscle degeneration, expression of a functional
dystroglycan through LARGE recognition and glycosylation was required.
The authors concluded that molecular recognition of dystroglycan by
LARGE is a key determinant in the biosynthetic pathway to produce mature
and functional dystroglycan.

Using mass spectrometry- and nuclear magnetic resonance-based structural
analyses, Yoshida-Moriguchi et al. (2010) identified a phosphorylated
O-mannosyl glycan on the mucin-like domain of recombinant alpha-DG,
which was required for laminin binding. Yoshida-Moriguchi et al. (2010)
demonstrated that patients with muscle-eye-brain disease (253280) and
Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy (253800), as well as mice with
myodystrophy, commonly have defects in a postphosphoryl modification of
this phosphorylated O-linked mannose, and that this modification is
mediated by the LARGE protein. Yoshida-Moriguchi et al. (2010) concluded
that their findings expand our understanding of the mechanisms that
underlie congenital muscular dystrophy.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a Turkish woman with limb-girdle muscular
dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy type C (MDDGC9; 613818) and severe
cognitive impairment reported by Dincer et al. (2003), Hara et al.
(2011) identified a homozygous mutation in the DAG1 gene (T192M;
128239.0001). Functional expression analysis in vitro and in mice
indicated that the mutation decreased LARGE (603590)-mediated
posttranslational O-mannosyl glycosylation of DAG1, interfering with its
receptor function and laminin binding in skeletal muscle and brain.

ANIMAL MODEL

Williamson et al. (1997) found that heterozygous Dag1-null mice were
viable and fertile. In contrast, homozygous embryos exhibited gross
developmental abnormalities beginning around 6.5 days' gestation. They
found that an early defect in the development of homozygous embryos was
a disruption of the Reichert membrane, an extra-embryonic basement
membrane. Consistent with the functional defects observed in Reichert
membrane, dystroglycan protein was localized in apposition to this
structure in normal egg cylinder-stage embryos. They also showed that
the localization of 2 critical structural elements of Reichert membrane,
laminin and collagen IV, were specifically disrupted in the homozygous
Dag1 embryos. The data indicated that dystroglycan is required for the
development of Reichert membrane and that disruption of basement
membrane organization is a common feature of muscular dystrophies linked
to the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex.

Henry and Campbell (1998) found that Dag1-null murine embryonic stem
cells had defective formation of basement membranes in embryoid bodies.
These results further indicated that dystroglycan-laminin interactions
are prerequisite for the deposition of other basement membrane proteins.
Dystroglycan may exert its influence on basement membrane assembly by
binding soluble laminin and organizing it on the cell surface.

Cote et al. (1999) reported that chimeric mice generated with ES cells
targeted for both dystroglycan alleles have skeletal muscles essentially
devoid of dystroglycans and develop a progressive muscle pathology with
changes emblematic of muscular dystrophies in humans. In addition, many
neuromuscular junctions are disrupted in these mice. The ultrastructure
of basement membranes and the deposition of laminin within them,
however, appears unaffected in dystroglycan-deficient muscles. Cote et
al. (1999) concluded that dystroglycans are necessary for myofiber
survival and synapse differentiation or stability, but not for the
formation of the muscle basement membrane, and that dystroglycans may
have more than a purely structural function in maintaining muscle
integrity.

Moore et al. (2002) showed that brain-selective deletion of dystroglycan
in mice is sufficient to cause congenital muscular dystrophy-like brain
malformations, including disarray of cerebral cortical layering, fusion
of cerebral hemispheres and cerebellar folia, and aberrant migration of
granule cells. Dystroglycan-null brain loses its high affinity binding
to the extracellular matrix protein laminin (see 150240) and shows
discontinuities in the pial surface basal lamina (glia limitans) that
probably underlie the neuronal migration errors. Furthermore, mutant
mice have severely blunted hippocampal long-term potentiation with
electrophysiologic characterization indicating that dystroglycan might
have a postsynaptic role in learning and memory. Moore et al. (2002)
concluded that these data strongly supported the hypothesis that defects
in dystroglycan are central to the pathogenesis of structural and
functional brain abnormalities seen in congenital muscular dystrophies.

Michele et al. (2002) demonstrated in both muscle-eye-brain disease
(253280) and Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy (253800) patients
that alpha-dystroglycan is expressed at the muscle membrane, but similar
hypoglycosylation in the diseases directly abolishes binding activity of
dystroglycan for the ligands laminin, neurexin (see 600565), and agrin
(103320). Michele et al. (2002) showed that this posttranslational
biochemical and functional disruption of alpha-dystroglycan is
recapitulated in the muscle and central nervous system of mutant
myodystrophy (myd) mice, who have a mutation in the LARGE gene. Michele
et al. (2002) demonstrated that myd mice have abnormal neuronal
migration in the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and hippocampus, and show
disruption of the basal lamina. In addition, myd mice reveal that
dystroglycan targets proteins to functional sites in brain through its
interactions with extracellular matrix proteins. Michele et al. (2002)
suggested that at least 3 mammalian genes function within a convergent
posttranslational processing pathway during the biosynthesis of
dystroglycan and that abnormal dystroglycan-ligand interactions underlie
the pathogenic mechanism of muscular dystrophy with brain abnormalities.

Cohn et al. (2002) found that striated muscle-specific disruption of the
Dag1 gene in mice resulted in loss of the dystrophin-glycoprotein
complex in differentiated muscle and a remarkably mild muscular
dystrophy with hypertrophy and without tissue fibrosis. They found that
satellite cells, expressing dystroglycan, supported continued efficient
regeneration of skeletal muscle along with transient expression of
dystroglycan in regenerating muscle fibers. Cohn et al. (2002)
demonstrated a similar phenomenon of reexpression of functional
dystroglycan in regenerating muscle fibers in a mild form of human
muscular dystrophy caused by disruption of posttranslational
dystroglycan processing. They concluded that maintenance of regenerative
capacity by satellite cells expressing dystroglycan is likely
responsible for mild disease progression in mice and possibly humans.
Cohn et al. (2002) suggested that inadequate repair of skeletal muscle
by satellite cells represents an important mechanism affecting the
pathogenesis of muscular dystrophy.

Hara et al. (2011) demonstrated that mice with a homozygous T190M
mutation in the Dag1 gene, which corresponds to the human T192M mutation
(128239.0001), developed muscular dystrophy and neurologic motor
impairment. The mutation decreased LARGE (603590)-mediated
posttranslational O-mannosyl glycosylation of Dag1, interfering with its
receptor function and laminin binding in skeletal muscle and brain.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY-DYSTROGLYCANOPATHY (LIMB-GIRDLE), TYPE C, 9 (1
family)
DAG1, THR192MET

In a Turkish woman with limb-girdle muscular
dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy (MDDGC9; 613818) and cognitive impairment,
Hara et al. (2011) identified a homozygous 575C-T transition in the DAG1
gene, resulting in a thr192-to-met (T192M) substitution in a highly
conserved residue in the N terminus of the protein. Each unaffected
parent was heterozygous for the mutation, which was not found in 200
control chromosomes. Functional expression analysis in vitro and in mice
indicated that the mutation decreased LARGE (603590)-mediated
posttranslational O-mannosyl glycosylation of DAG1, interfering with its
receptor function and laminin binding in skeletal muscle and brain.

609591	TITLE *609591 RIC-LIKE PROTEIN WITHOUT CAAX MOTIF 1; RIT1
;;RAS-LIKE PROTEIN EXPRESSED IN MANY TISSUES; RIT;;
ROC1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

RIT belongs to the RAS (HRAS; 190020) subfamily of small GTPases (Hynds
et al., 2003).

CLONING

By PCR using degenerate primers based on the conserved G3 and G4 domains
of RAS, followed by screening a mouse retina cDNA library, Lee et al.
(1996) cloned mouse Rit. The deduced 219-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 25.6 kD. By EST database analysis, Lee et
al. (1996) identified human RIT. The deduced human protein contains 219
amino acids and shares 94% identity with mouse Rit. Human and mouse RIT
have 5 highly conserved domains characteristic of small G proteins, but
they lack the C-terminal CAAX prenylation motif found in several other
RAS-like proteins. Northern blot analysis detected a 1.2-kb transcript
in all mouse tissues examined. Epitope-tagged mouse Rit localized to the
plasma membrane of transfected cells.

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to Drosophila Ric,
Wes et al. (1996) identified human RIT and RIN (609592). The core GTPase
domain of RIT shares 76% identity with that of RIN, and there is only 1
conservative substitution between the 2 human proteins and Drosophila
Ric within the effector G2 region. Northern blot analysis detected RIT
transcripts of 1.35, 2.9, and 3.9 kb in most tissues examined.

GENE FUNCTION

Lee et al. (1996) demonstrated that mouse Rit bound radiolabeled GTP.

Shao et al. (1999) demonstrated that recombinant human RIT and RIN bound
GTP and exhibited intrinsic GTPase activity. Conversion of gln79 to leu
in RIT resulted in complete loss of GTPase activity. The activity of RIT
and RIN was significantly different from that of the majority of
RAS-related GTPases, and the GTP dissociation rates were 5- to 10-fold
faster than most RAS-like GTPases. Yeast 2-hybrid analysis showed that
RIT and RIN interacted with the RAS-binding proteins RALGDS (601619),
RLF (180610), and AF6 (MLLT4; 159559), but not with RAF kinases (e.g.,
RAF1; 164760), RIN1 (605965), or the p110 subunit of PI3K (see 171834).
Shao et al. (1999) concluded that RIT and RIN regulate signaling
pathways and cellular processes distinct from those controlled by RAS.

By expression of RIT in a human neuroblastoma cell line, Hynds et al.
(2003) demonstrated that RIT increased neurite outgrowth and branching
through MEK (see MEK1; 176872)-dependent and MEK-independent signaling
mechanisms, respectively. Adenoviral expression of wildtype or
constitutively active RIT increased neurite initiation, elongation, and
branching on endogenous matrix or a purified laminin-1 substratum. This
outgrowth was morphologically distinct from that promoted by
constitutively active RAS or RAF. Constitutively active RIT increased
phosphorylation of ERK1 (MAPK3; 601795)/ERK2 (MAPK1; 176948), but not
AKT (see AKT1; 164730). A MEK inhibitor blocked RIT-induced neurite
initiation, but not elongation or branching.

Shi and Andres (2005) found that stimulation of a rat pheochromocytoma
cell line by growth factors, including nerve growth factor (NGF;
162030), resulted in rapid and prolonged Rit activation. Ectopic
expression of active human RIT promoted neurite outgrowth and stimulated
activation of both Erk and p38 MAP kinase (MAPK14; 600289) signaling
pathways. RIT-induced differentiation depended upon both MAP kinase
cascades, since MEK inhibition blocked RIT-induced neurite outgrowth,
and p38 blockade inhibited neurite elongation and branching, but not
neurite initiation. Moreover, the ability of NGF to promote neuronal
differentiation was attenuated by Rit knockdown.

Heo et al. (2006) surveyed plasma membrane targeting mechanisms by
imaging the subcellular localization of 125 fluorescent
protein-conjugated Ras, Rab, Arf, and Rho proteins. Of 48 proteins that
were localized to the plasma membrane, 37 contained clusters of
positively charged amino acids. To test whether these polybasic clusters
bind negatively charged phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate lipids,
Heo et al. (2006) developed a chemical phosphatase activation method to
deplete plasma membrane phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate.
Unexpectedly, proteins with polybasic clusters dissociated from the
plasma membrane only when both phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and
phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate were depleted, arguing that
both lipid second messengers jointly regulate plasma membrane targeting.

MAPPING

Wes et al. (1996) stated that the RIT gene was mapped to chromosome 1 by
somatic cell hybrid analysis. The mouse Rit gene maps to chromosome 3.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 17 unrelated patients with Noonan syndrome-8 (NS8; 615355), Aoki et
al. (2013) identified heterozygous mutations in the RIT1 gene (see,
e.g., 609591.0001-609591.0004). The first mutations were found by exome
sequencing and subsequent mutations were identified from a larger cohort
of patients screened for the RIT1 gene. A total of 9 missense mutations
were found in 17 (9%) of 180 individuals suspected to have the disorder.
The phenotype was characterized by short stature, distinctive facial
features, and a high incidence of congenital heart defects and
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. A subset of patients showed intellectual
disabilities. All of the mutations occurred de novo, except in 1 patient
who inherited the mutation from a mother with a Noonan syndrome
phenotype. The mutations tended to cluster in the switch II region, and
in vitro functional expression studies of 3 of the mutations showed that
they resulted in a gain of function. Transfection of 2 of the mutations
into zebrafish embryos resulted in a variety of developmental defects,
including gastrulation defects, craniofacial abnormalities, pericardial
edema, and elongated yolk sac. A smaller percentage of mutant embryos
showed even more disorganized growth and abnormal cardiogenesis. The
findings were similar to those observed with mutations in other RAS
genes (see, e.g., PTPN11, 176876; SOS1, 182530; NRAS, 164790) causing
other forms of Noonan syndrome.

RIT1 gene, resulting in a glu81-to-gly (E81G) substitution at a
conserved residue. In vitro cellular expression studies showed that the
E81G mutation resulted in a gain of function. Transfection of the E81G
mutation into zebrafish embryos resulted in a variety of developmental

sequencing, was not present in several control databases. In vitro
cellular expression studies showed that the F82L mutation resulted in a
gain of function.

In 4 unrelated patients with Noonan syndrome-8 (615355), Aoki et al.

of the RIT1 gene, resulting in a gly95-to-ala (G95A) substitution. The
mutation, which was initially found by exome sequencing, was not present
in several control databases. In vitro cellular expression studies
showed that the G95A mutation resulted in a gain of function.
Transfection of the G95A mutation into zebrafish embryos resulted in a
variety of developmental defects, including gastrulation defects,

601239	TITLE *601239 DYSTROBREVIN, ALPHA; DTNA
;;DYSTROBREVIN;;
DYSTROPHIN-RELATED PROTEIN 3; DRP3;;
D18S892E
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching an EST database for novel dystrophin (300377)-related
genes, followed by screening human adult brain and skeletal muscle cDNA
libraries, Sadoulet-Puccio et al. (1996) cloned dystrobrevin. The
largest ORF in the dystrobrevin gene shows 50% homology to the
cysteine-rich and C-terminal domains of dystrophin, and 84% homology to
a phosphoprotein found in the electric organ postsynaptic membrane in
Torpedo californica. Five distinct mRNA transcripts were preferentially
expressed in different tissues.

Newey et al. (2001) stated that 3 Dtna isoforms are expressed in mouse
skeletal muscle. The longest isoform, Dtna1, contains an N-terminal
EF-hand region, followed by zinc-binding ZZ domain, a muscle-expressed
variable region, 2 coiled-coil regions, and a C-terminal domain with a
tyrosine phosphorylation motif. Dtna1 also has 2 syntrophin (see SNTA1;
601017)-binding sites that overlap the variable region and a
dystrophin-binding site that overlaps the first coiled-coil domain.
Dtna2 lacks part of the C-terminal domain, including the tyrosine
phosphorylation motif, and Dtna3 lacks the variable region and
coiled-coil domains.

GENE STRUCTURE

Sadoulet-Puccio et al. (1997) determined that the DTNA gene contains 23
exons and spans at least 180 kb. Three different C termini of
dystrobrevin are generated by mutually exclusive mRNA splicing of 3
exons. Two alternatively spliced exons (exons 11A and 12) are used
exclusively in striated muscle. A comparison of the genomic organization
of dystrophin and dystrobrevin showed that the 2 genes have significant
similarities in their genomic structure, implying an ancestral or
evolutionary relationship.

MAPPING

Khurana et al. (1994) mapped an EST corresponding to the DTNA gene to
chromosome 18q12.1-q12.2 by FISH.

Ambrose et al. (1997) mapped the mouse homolog of dystrobrevin to
proximal mouse chromosome 18.

GENE FUNCTION

The dystrophin-associated protein complex (DPC), located at the
sarcolemma, can be divided into 3 subcomplexes: the dystroglycan
complex, the sarcoglycan complex, and the cytoplasmic complex. The last
consists of 2 families of proteins, the syntrophins and dystrobrevin.
Metzinger et al. (1997) found that anti-dystrobrevin antibodies stain
the sarcolemma in normal skeletal muscle, indicating that dystrobrevin
colocalizes with dystrophin and the dystrophin-associated protein
complex. By contrast, dystrobrevin membrane staining was severely
reduced in muscles of Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients and also
dramatically reduced in patients with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy
arising from the loss of 1 or all of the sarcoglycan components (e.g.,
LGMD2C; 253700). Normal dystrobrevin staining was observed in patients
with other forms of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy where dystrophin and
the rest of the dystrophin-associated protein complex are normally
expressed (e.g., LGMD2A; 253600), as well as in other neuromuscular
disorders. Their results showed that dystrobrevin deficiency is a
generic feature of dystrophies linked to dystrophin and the
dystrophin-associated proteins. This was the first indication that a
cytoplasmic component of the dystrophin-associated protein complex may
be involved in the pathogenesis of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy.

Yoshida et al. (2000) found that the N-terminal half of dystrobrevin
participates in an association with the sarcoglycan-sarcospan complex.
The authors hypothesized that the sarcoglycan-sarcospan complex is
linked to the signaling protein neuronal nitric oxide synthase (163731)
via alpha-syntrophin (601017) associated with dystrobrevin.

The mammalian dystrobrevin gene encodes several protein isoforms that
are expressed in different tissues, including brain and muscle. Blake et
al. (1998) reported a form of dystrobrevin, designated beta-dystrobrevin
(602415) by them, a dystrophin-related protein that is abundantly
expressed in brain and other tissues, but is not found in muscle. The
dystrobrevin in muscle was designated alpha-dystrobrevin.

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis and coimmunoprecipitation analysis of
transfected COS-7 cells, Newey et al. (2001) showed that the mouse
intermediate filament protein syncoilin (SYNC1; 611750) interacted with
mouse Dtna1 and Dtna2. Dtna and syncoilin colocalized at the
neuromuscular junction of skeletal muscle. Newey et al. (2001) concluded
that DTNA provides a link between dystrophin protein complex and the
intermediate filament network at the neuromuscular junction.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a 4-generation Japanese family with left ventricular noncompaction
(LVNC1; 604169), Ichida et al. (2001) analyzed the DTNA gene and
identified heterozygosity for a missense mutation (P121L; 601239.0001)
in affected members that was not found in unaffected family members or
in 300 age- and sex-matched controls.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
LEFT VENTRICULAR NONCOMPACTION 1
DTNA, PRO121LEU

In 6 affected members of a 4-generation Japanese family with left
ventricular noncompaction-1 (604169), Ichida et al. (2001) identified
heterozygosity for a 362C-T transition in exon 3 of the DTNA gene,
resulting in a pro121-to-leu (P121L) substitution. Protein sequence
analysis predicted that the P121L substitution would result in the
reduction of an alpha-helix by 2 amino acids and the removal of a loop
in this portion of the protein, which encodes the calcium-binding
EF-hand domain, possibly resulting in a significant secondary structural
change. Five of the 6 affected family members had other congenital heart
defects, primarily one or more ventricular septal defects, in addition
to LVNC. The mutation was not found in unaffected family members or in
300 age- and sex-matched controls (200 of which were Japanese and 100
Caucasian).

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Sasahara et al. (2000) cloned novel mouse and human cDNAs, which they
designated SR-25, from insulinoma cDNA libraries. The deduced human
218-amino acid protein shares 77.7% sequence identity with the mouse
homolog and contains a serine-arginine (SR) repeat and 2 types of amino
acid clusters: a serine cluster and a highly basic cluster. Northern
blot analysis detected expression in all mouse tissues tested, with
abundant expression in testis and thymus. Based on the structure and
expression pattern of SR-25, Sasahara et al. (2000) suggested that the
protein is localized in the nucleus and may contribute to RNA splicing.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the ARL6IP4
gene to chromosome 12 (TMAP stSG29931).

118970	TITLE *118970 CLATHRIN, LIGHT POLYPEPTIDE B; CLTB
;;LCB
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Clathrin is the main structural component of the lattice covering the
cytoplasmic face of the coated pits and coated vesicles in which
specific macromolecules are entrapped in the process of
receptor-mediated endocytosis. Clathrin is a large, soluble protein
composed of heavy chains, which have molecular masses of about 192 kD,
and light chains, which have molecular masses of about 32 to 38 kD. Two
major classes of clathrin light chains, referred to as LCA (CLTA;
118960) and LCB (CTLB), have been identified (summary by Kirchhausen et
al., 1987). For additional information on clathrin, see 118960.

CLONING

Jackson et al. (1987) identified 4 distinct forms of bovine clathrin
light chains. This molecular variability derived from tissue-specific
splicing of Lca and Lcb genes.

Brodsky et al. (1987) identified that part of the light chain sequence
that mediates heavy chain binding and is the region of strongest
homology with intermediate filament proteins. Sequence analysis shows an
overall homology of 60% between LCA and LCB and the presence of
brain-specific insertion sequences.

Jackson and Parham (1988) compared cDNAs encoding the brain and nonbrain
forms of human LCA and LCB with their homologs in cow and rat. The
significant differences that distinguish LCA from LCB and the brain from
the nonbrain forms show remarkable preservation in all 3 species. Each
clathrin triskelion consists of 3 heavy chains and 3 light chains. In
the brain, tissue-specific mRNA splicing yields larger forms of LCA and
LCB, containing additional insertion sequences of 30 and 18 amino acids,
respectively.

MAPPING

By Southern blot analysis carried out on genomic DNA extracted from a
panel of mouse-human somatic cell hybrids and by isotopic in situ
hybridization, Ponnambalam et al. (1994) assigned the CLTB gene to human
chromosome 4q2-q3. However, Gross (2011) mapped the CLTB gene to
chromosome 5q35.2 based on an alignment of the CLTB sequence (GenBank
GENBANK BC006457) with the genomic sequence (GRCh37).

603647	TITLE *603647 BCS1, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG-LIKE; BCS1L
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The human BCS1L gene encodes a homolog of S. cerevisiae bcs1 protein
involved in the assembly of complex III of the mitochondrial respiratory
chain.

CLONING

The S. cerevisiae bcs1 protein is a constituent of the inner
mitochondrial membrane and is required for the expression of functional
ubiquinol-cytochrome-c reductase (bc1) complex (see 191328). The bcs1
protein shares sequence similarity with members of the AAA (ATPases
associated with various cellular activities) superfamily (see 601681).
By searching an EST database for sequences related to bcs1, Petruzzella
et al. (1998) identified a cDNA encoding human BCS1L (BCS1-like). The
predicted 420-amino acid human protein is 50% identical to yeast bcs1
and, like bcs1, contains 2 conserved nucleotide-binding motifs. Although
BCS1L does not contain an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence,
in vitro mitochondrial import and trypsin-protection assays demonstrated
that it is imported into mitochondria. Northern blot analysis revealed
that BCS1L is expressed ubiquitously as a 1.4-kb mRNA. The authors also
detected a 4.5-kb transcript that they considered to be either an
alternative BCS1L mRNA or an mRNA derived from a related gene.

GENE FUNCTION

Found within the inner mitochondrial membrane, BCS1L is presumed to
facilitate insertion of Rieske Fe/S protein into precursors to complex
III during assembly of the respiratory chain (Cruciat et al., 1999).
Complex III then becomes assembled with complexes IV and I into a
respirasome supercomplex that facilitates the electron transfer required
for the synthesis of ATP.

MAPPING

Based on sequence similarity to ESTs, Petruzzella et al. (1998)
tentatively mapped the BCS1L gene to 2q33.

GENE STRUCTURE

De Lonlay et al. (2001) showed that the BCS1L gene consists of 7 exons.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Mitochondrial Complex III Deficiency, Nuclear Type 1

De Lonlay et al. (2001) found 4 biallelic mutations in the BCS1L gene in
6 patients from 4 families with mitochondrial complex III deficiency
nuclear type 1 (MC3DN1; 124000) characterized by neonatal proximal
tubulopathy, hepatic involvement, and encephalopathy. Complementation
studies in yeast confirmed the deleterious effect of these missense
mutations. De Lonlay et al. (2001) suggested that mutation of BCS1L is a
frequent cause of complex III deficiency, as one-third of their Turkish
patients had mutations in the BSC1L gene. De Lonlay et al. (2001)
reported that they had not been able to detect BCS1L mutations in
complex III-deficient patients with clinical presentations other than
neonatal tubulopathy with hepatic involvement and encephalopathy.

- GRACILE Syndrome

The GRACILE (growth retardation, amino aciduria, cholestasis, iron
overload, lactic acidosis, and early death) syndrome (603358) belongs to
the disease heritage of Finland. All affected families carry the same
ancestral haplotype on 2q33-q37, indicating 1 founder mutation (Visapaa
et al., 1998). Visapaa et al. (2002) identified a homozygous
ser78-to-gly mutation (S78G; 603358.0005) in the BCS1L gene in all
Finnish patients with GRACILE syndrome studied. In addition, they
identified 5 different mutations in the BCS1L gene in 3 British infants,
previously reported by Morris et al. (1995), whose symptoms resembled
those in GRACILE syndrome but who also had complex III deficiency and
neurologic symptoms. The phenotype of the Turkish patients in whom de
Lonlay et al. (2001) demonstrated mutations in the BCS1L gene was
distinctly different from that of the Finnish patients. Whereas the
Turkish patients had complex III deficiency, the Finnish patients had
complex III activity within the normal range. The Finnish patients had
no neurologic problems, but had marked hepatic iron overload, associated
with abnormal levels of proteins involved in iron transfer and storage,
and free plasma iron. These findings implied that BCS1L has another
cellular function that is uncharacterized but essential, and that it is
putatively involved in iron metabolism.

- Bjornstad Syndrome

Bjornstad syndrome (262000) is an autosomal recessive condition
characterized by sensorineural hearing loss and pili torti. Lubianca
Neto et al. (1998) mapped the Bjornstad syndrome locus to 2q34-q36.
Hinson et al. (2007) refined the map location of the disorder to 2q35
and demonstrated mutations in the BCS1L gene (e.g., 603647.0001).

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

To understand how BCS2L mutations cause such widely different clinical
phenotypes, Hinson et al. (2007) considered the locations of defects on
the BCS1L protein structure and compared the function of mutant BCS1L in
yeast and in human lymphocytes. Their studies showed that all BCS1L
mutations disrupted the assembly of mitochondrial respirasomes (the
basic unit of respiration in human mitochondria), but the clinical
severity of the mutations was correlated with the production of reactive
oxygen species. The data indicated that in addition to mitochondrial
heteroplasmy and variable energy requirements of tissues,
tissue-specific sensitivities to reactive oxygen species contribute to
the variability of the manifestations of mitochondrial defects.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX III DEFICIENCY, NUCLEAR TYPE 1
BCS1L, SER277ASN

In 2 affected sibs and 1 fetus in a consanguineous family with
mitochondrial complex III deficiency nuclear type 1 (MC3DN1; 124000)
characterized by neonatal tubulopathy, encephalopathy, and liver
failure, de Lonlay et al. (2001) identified a homozygous 830G-A
transition in the BCS1L gene, resulting in a ser277-to-asp (S277N)
substitution.

.0002
LEIGH SYNDROME DUE TO MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX III DEFICIENCY
BCS1L, PRO99LEU

In 2 patients with complex III deficiency (124000), a boy and a girl,
born to unrelated consanguineous families, de Lonlay et al. (2001)
identified the same homozygous C-to-T transition at nucleotide 296 in
exon 1 of the BCS1L gene, causing the substitution of a leucine for a
highly conserved proline at codon 99 (P99L). The patients had metabolic
acidosis, hepatic involvement, neurologic deterioration, and brainstem
and basal ganglia lesions consistent with a diagnosis of Leigh syndrome
(256000). One patient had abnormal ventilation patterns and proximal
renal tubulopathy.

.0003
MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX III DEFICIENCY, NUCLEAR TYPE 1
BCS1L, ARG155PRO

In a boy of Turkish origin with complex III deficiency (124000) born to
nonconsanguineous parents, de Lonlay et al. (2001) identified compound
heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the BCS1L gene: a 464C-G transversion
in exon 3 of the BCS1L gene, resulting in an arg155-to-pro (R155P)
substitution, and a 1057G-A transition in exon 7, resulting in a
val353-to-met (V353M; 603647.0004) substitution.

GRACILE SYNDROME
BCS1L, SER78GLY

Visapaa et al. (2002) reported that all GRACILE syndrome (603358)
patients in Finland were homozygous for a 232A-G mutation in exon 2 of
the BCS1L gene, resulting in a ser78-to-gly (S78G) substitution. Unlike
the Turkish patients reported by de Lonlay et al. (2001), the Finnish
patients had normal complex III activity and no neurologic problems, but
did have marked iron overload.

.0006
MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX III DEFICIENCY, NUCLEAR TYPE 1
BCS1L, ARG45CYS

In 2 Spanish sibs with fatal infantile complex III deficiency (124000),
De Meirleir et al. (2003) identified compound heterozygosity for
mutation in the BCS1L gene: a 246C-T transition in exon 1, resulting in
an arg45-to-cys (R45C) substitution, and a 279C-T transition in exon 1,
resulting in an arg56-to-ter (R56X; 603647.0007) substitution. The R45C
substitution occurs in a crucial targeting signal of the gene and is
predicted to interfere with proper protein functioning. Each parent was
heterozygous for 1 of the mutations. Both patients had severe metabolic
acidosis noted shortly after birth, as well as severe liver dysfunction
and a renal tubulopathy. One died at age 3 weeks of lactic acidosis. The
second infant also had obvious neurologic involvement, with delayed
myelination, axial hypotonia, and developmental delay. He died at age 3
months. Postmortem liver examination of both infants showed liver
fibrosis, severe cholestasis, and hepatosiderosis with accumulation of
iron in aggregates of macrophages and in Kupffer cells. Mitochondria
appeared enlarged with few or no cristae and a fluffy matrix. De
Meirleir et al. (2003) suggested that the iron accumulation could be
explained by the lack of incorporation of iron in the iron-sulfur
cluster of complex III.

Ramos-Arroyo et al. (2009) reported another Spanish infant with the R45C
and R56X mutations. She presented with neonatal severe hypotonia, food
intolerance, and vomiting. She soon developed a proximal renal
tubulopathy with glucosuria, phosphaturia, and aminoaciduria, metabolic
lactic acidosis, and hepatic involvement. Bilateral cataracts were also
noted. At age 4 months, she showed nystagmus, hypertonia, microcephaly,
developmental delay, and failure to thrive. Her neurologic condition and
metabolic acidosis worsened rapidly, and she died at 6 months of age.
Biochemical studies of muscle tissue showed impaired activity of
mitochondrial complex III. Ramos-Arroyo et al. (2009) noted that this
child did not have evidence of altered iron metabolism, as had been
observed in the patients reported by De Meirleir et al. (2003), and as
has been observed in patients with the allelic disorder GRACILE syndrome
(603358). Ramos-Arroyo et al. (2009) postulated that phenotypic
variability even in individuals with the same BCS1L genotype may reflect
tissue-specific expression of the mutant gene.

BJORNSTAD SYNDROME
BCS1L, ARG183HIS

In affected members of the family with Bjornstad syndrome (262000) in
which Lubianca Neto et al. (1998) demonstrated linkage to 2q, Hinson et
al. (2007) identified homozygosity for a C-to-T transition in the BCS1L
gene, resulting in an arg183-to-his (R183H) substitution. Eight
individuals in 2 sibships related as first cousins once removed were
affected; the parents in each case were consanguineous.

.0009
BJORNSTAD SYNDROME WITH MILD MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX III DEFICIENCY
MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX III DEFICIENCY, NUCLEAR TYPE 1, INCLUDED
BCS1L, ARG184CYS

In a sporadic case of Bjornstad syndrome (262000) with mild
mitochondrial complex III deficiency (124000), Hinson et al. (2007)
found compound heterozygosity for 2 missense mutations in the BCS1L
gene: arg184 to cys (R184C) and gly35 to arg (G35R; 603647.0010).

In a Moroccan girl with mitochondrial complex III deficiency (124000),
Fernandez-Vizarra et al. (2007) identified compound heterozygosity for
the R184C mutation and a 547C-T transition in exon 3 of the BCS1L gene,
resulting in an arg183-to-cys (R183C; 603647.0012) substitution. She
presented at age 9 months with acute psychomotor regression, hypotonia,
and failure to thrive, which progressed to spastic quadriparesis and
mental retardation associated with abnormal signal intensities in the
thalami, basal ganglia, and periventricular white matter, consistent
with an encephalopathy. Heart, liver, and kidneys were apparently
unaffected, but she was also noted to have brittle hair. Studies in
yeast showed that both mutations significantly reduced mitochondrial
cytochrome content and respiratory activity, as well as caused a
decreased incorporation of the Rieske iron-sulfur protein (UQCRFS1;
191327) into complex III. Further studies showed decreased levels of
fully assembled complex III. The findings suggested that BCS1L is
necessary for proper complex III assembly.

MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX III DEFICIENCY, NUCLEAR TYPE 1
BCS1L, THR50ALA

In a 4-year-old Spanish boy with isolated mitochondrial complex III
deficiency (124000), Blazquez et al. (2009) identified a homozygous
148A-G transition in exon 1 of the BCS1L gene, resulting in a
thr50-to-ala (T50A) substitution in the mitochondrial sorting sequence.
He presented at 6 months of age with psychomotor retardation, failure to
thrive, hypotonia, lactic acidosis, and hepatic dysfunction. Physical
examination showed unstable head support, poor eye fixation, coarse
facies, and epicanthus. There was hypertrichosis of the frontal head
zone and limbs, and excessive fat distribution in the upper back, neck,
hands and feet, with almost no fat on the limbs. Respiratory chain
activity in muscle and fibroblasts showed an isolated complex III defect
(58% of normal in muscle, 93% in fibroblasts). At age 4 years, he still
showed psychomotor retardation, had developed mild sensorineural hearing
loss, and persistent lactic acidemia, but renal function, hair, and iron
metabolism were normal. Brain MRI was normal. The mutation was not found
in 400 control alleles, and each unaffected parent was heterozygous for
the mutation.

CLONING

By genomic sequence analysis, Marzluff et al. (2002) identified the
mouse and human HIST1H4B genes. All mouse and human H4 genes, including
HIST1H4B, encode the same protein.

MAPPING

By analysis of a YAC contig from 6p21.3, Albig et al. (1997)
characterized a cluster of 35 histone genes, including H4/i.

By genomic sequence analysis, Marzluff et al. (2002) determined that the
histone gene cluster on chromosome 6p22-p21, which they called histone
gene cluster-1 (HIST1), contains 55 histone genes, including HIST1H4B.

NCK-INTERACTING KINASE; NIK
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Activation of the JNK (see 601158) pathway by a variety of environmental
and extracellular stimuli is mediated by multiple STE20-like protein
kinases (e.g., STK25, 602255). By screening a human macrophage cDNA
library with degenerate PCR primers to sequences of STE20 family
members, Yao et al. (1999) obtained a novel cDNA that they termed HGK
(for HPK1/GCK-like kinase). The HGK cDNA encodes a 1,165-amino acid
protein. Its N terminus has a catalytic kinase domain with 11 kinase
subdomains. It shares 47% and 48% amino acid sequence identity to the
catalytic domain of HPK1 (601983) and GCK (603166), respectively. The
authors identified 2 HGK isoforms, one of which has no proline-rich
domains, and another, longer variant that contains such domains and
appears to be expressed in brain only. Northern blot analysis revealed
expression of 3 HGK transcripts of approximately 4.6, 6.5, and 8.5 kb in
heart, brain, skeletal muscle, pancreas, placenta, liver, lung, and
kidney. By Western blot analysis with a polyclonal antibody, Yao et al.
(1999) found that the 130-kD protein is expressed in multiple cell
lines. Expression of HGK in transfected cell lines resulted in strong
JNK activation and, in turn, c-jun transcriptional activity. HGK-induced
JNK activation was inhibited by dominant-negative MKK4 (MAP2K4; 601335),
MKK7 (MAP2K7; 603014), and TAK1 (MAP3K7; 602614) mutants. TNFA (191160)
also stimulated HGK kinase activity.

GENE FUNCTION

Using an RNA interference-based screen, Tang et al. (2006) found 4
negative regulators of insulin-responsive glucose transport in mouse
adipocytes: Pctk1 (311550), Pftk1 (610679), Ikbka (CHUK; 600664), and
Map4k4. Map4k4 suppressed expression of adipogenic transcription
factors, Cebpa (116897), Cebpb (189965), and Pparg (601487), and it
suppressed surface expression of Glut4 (SLC2A4; 138190), resulting in
attenuated membrane hexose transport activity. Depletion of Map4k4 by
RNA interference early in differentiation enhanced adipogenesis and
triglyceride deposition; in fully differentiated adipocytes, loss of
Map4k4 upregulated Glut4 expression. Conversely, conditions that
inhibited adipogenesis, such as Tnfa treatment or Pparg depletion,
markedly upregulated Map4k4. Tang et al. (2006) concluded that
MAP4K4-dependent signaling inhibited PPARG-responsive gene expression,
adipogenesis, and insulin-stimulated glucose transport.

Aouadi et al. (2009) reported the engineering of
beta-1,3-D-glucan-encapsulated siRNA particles (GeRPs) as efficient oral
delivery vehicles that potently silenced genes in mouse macrophages in
vitro and in vivo. Oral gavage of mice with GeRPs containing as little
as 20 micrograms per kilogram siRNA directed against TNF-alpha (191160)
depleted its mRNA in macrophages recovered from peritoneum, spleen,
liver, and lung, and lowered serum TNF-alpha levels. Screening with
GeRPs for inflammation genes revealed that Map4k4 is a mediator of
cytokine expression. Importantly, silencing Map4k4 in macrophages in
vivo protected mice from lipopolysaccharide-induced lethality by
inhibiting TNF-alpha and interleukin-1-beta (147720) production. Aouadi
et al. (2009) concluded that their technology defined a strategy for
oral delivery of siRNA to attenuate inflammatory responses in human
disease.

MAPPING

By analysis of somatic cell hybrids, Ishikawa et al. (1998) mapped the
MAP4K4 gene, which they termed KIAA0687, to chromosome 2.

608920	TITLE *608920 PHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL TRANSFER PROTEIN, MEMBRANE-ASSOCIATED, 2; PITPNM2
;;PYK2 N-TERMINAL DOMAIN-INTERACTING RECEPTOR 3; NIR3;;
KIAA1457
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

PITPNM2 belongs to a family of membrane-associated phosphatidylinositol
transfer domain-containing proteins that share homology with the
Drosophila retinal degeneration B (rdgB) protein (Ocaka et al., 2005).

CLONING

By screening brain and heart cDNA libraries using PITPNM3 (608921) as
probe, Lev et al. (1999) cloned PITPNM2, which they called NIR3. The
deduced 1,349-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 150
kD. PITPNM2 shares structural domains with other PITPNM family members,
including an N-terminal phosphatidylinositol (PI) transfer domain, an
acidic calcium-binding region, 6 transmembrane domains, and a conserved
C-terminal domain. Lev et al. (1999) also cloned a PITPNM3 splice
variant that encodes a protein lacking amino acids 50 to 328 in the
N-terminal PI transfer domain. The calculated molecular mass of this
variant is 125 kD. Northern blot analysis detected PITPNM2 transcripts
of 7.5 and 9.5 kb that were highly expressed in thymus, heart, brain,
ovary, and testis. Immunohistochemical analysis of adult rat brain found
Pitpnm2 prominently expressed in cell bodies within pyramidal layer V
and in Purkinje cells of the cerebellum. PITPNM2 expression was also
detected in supraoptic nuclei, in the middle of the preoptic region, and
in the inner segment and the inner and outer plexiform layers of the
retina.

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned PITPNM2, which they designated
KIAA1457. RT-PCR ELISA detected robust PITPNM2 expression in all adult
and fetal tissues and all specific brain regions examined.

GENE FUNCTION

Lev et al. (1999) found that the acidic domain of PITPNM2 bound calcium,
the C-terminal domain bound PYK2 (601212), and the isolated PI transfer
domain supported PI transfer in mutant yeast. Analysis of PITPNM2 or
PYK2 immunoprecipitates of cells coexpressing PITPNM2 and PYK2
demonstrated that both proteins were tyrosine phosphorylated, suggesting
that PITPNM2 is a PYK2 substrate.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ocaka et al. (2005) determined that the PITPNM2 gene contains 25 exons
and spans approximately 49 kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (2000) mapped the PITPNM2
gene to chromosome 12. Ocaka et al. (2005) mapped the PITPNM2 gene to
chromosome 12p24 using radiation hybrid analysis and FISH.

NORWALK VIRUS INFECTION, RESISTANCE TO, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The classic human secretor locus (Se) FUT2 encodes
alpha-(1,2)fucosyltransferase, which regulates expression of the Lewis
ABO(H) histo-blood group antigens on the surface of epithelial cells and
in body fluids and determines the secretion status of the ABO antigens
(see 110300). Secretor status of this polymorphic protein was used by
Mohr (1951) to provide the first autosomal linkage in humans between
secretor factor and the Lutheran blood group (see 111200) (summary by
Hazra et al., 2008).

The secretor factor (Se) might be considered either a physiologic trait
or an honorary blood group (VAM). The individual who is a so-called
secretor has demonstrable ABH blood group antigen in the saliva and
other body fluids; the nonsecretor does not. Secretor is dominant.

CLONING

Rouquier et al. (1995) used the FUT1 cDNA to screen chromosome 19 cosmid
libraries in search of the FUT2 gene. One cosmid was isolated that
contained 2 distinct segments that cross-hybridized with FUT1.

Kelly et al. (1995) found that SEC2 encodes a predicted 332-amino acid
polypeptide and a longer isoform that shares 68% sequence identity with
the COOH-terminal 292 residues of human FUT1.

GENE FUNCTION

The secretor locus is linked to the Lutheran blood group locus (111200)
and the myotonic dystrophy locus (DMPK; 605377). Coupled with the
ability to determine the secretor status of the fetus from amniotic
fluid (Harper et al., 1971), this linkage potentially allows prenatal
diagnosis of myotonic dystrophy (DM; 160900). Oriol et al. (1981)
suggested that the Se locus and the Hh (FUT1) locus (211100) may be
closely linked. This is a condition of their model. Classically, the Se
gene is considered to be a regulatory gene controlling expression of the
structural gene H in external secretions. Under this hypothesis, Bombay
(h-h) persons should not be able to express the Se gene. Oriol et al.
(1981) analyzed statistically the 44 published Bombay pedigrees and
concluded that in fact there is no suppression of Se in Bombay persons.
Furthermore, they found a lod score of 12.9 at 1% recombination for
linkage of Bombay and secretor. They suggested that Hh and Se are both
structural genes, each coding for a 2-alpha-L-fucosyltransferase.

Le Pendu et al. (1982) presented evidence that the fucosyltransferase of
epithelial origin, coded by the Se gene, is able to transform both type
1 and type 2 natural substrate, whereas the enzyme of mesodermal origin,
coded by the H gene (mutant in the Bombay phenotype), works
preferentially on type 2 natural substrate. The close linkage of the 2
genes is of interest. The possible existence of 2 alpha (1-to-2)
fucosyltransferases was first suggested on the basis of stereochemical
differences between the 2 precursor chains, types 1 and 2. Gedde-Dahl et
al. (1984) found linkage of Se and APOE (107741)--peak lod score 3.3 at
recombination fraction 0.08 in males and 1.36 at 0.22 in females, and
linkage of APOE and Lu with lod score 4.52 at zero recombination in
sexes combined. C3-APOE linkage gave lod score 4.0 at theta 0.18 in
males but 0.04 at theta 0.45 in females. A summarizing map was given
(Gedde-Dahl et al., 1984; see their Figure 3).

Kudo et al. (1996) reviewed briefly the biosynthetic pathways involved
in synthesis of Lewis blood group antigens and secretion of ABH into
saliva.

MAPPING

The Lutheran secretor linkage was the first autosomal linkage identified
in man. It was first discovered by Mohr (1951) as a linkage of the
Lutheran blood group and the 'recessive' Lewis blood group. This was
recognized as the Lutheran-secretor linkage (Mohr, 1954) after the
ingenious interpretation by Grubb (1953) of the interactions between the
Lewis (FUT3) locus (111100) determining the presence/absence of Lewis
substance in the saliva and on red cells and the Se locus determining
secretion of ABH blood group substances in the saliva and Le(a) or Le(b)
expression in red cells. Discovery of the secretor-C3 linkage in Mohr's
department (Eiberg et al. (1983)) and the assignment of the C3 locus
(120700) to chromosome 19 indicated that this historic linkage group is
on that chromosome.

Rouquier et al. (1995) observed that a 100-kb cosmid contig, localized
to 19q13.3 by fluorescence in situ hybridization, contained FUT1 and 2
FUT1-related sequences, termed SEC1 and SEC2 for secretor candidate 1
and 2. SEC1 and SEC2 were separated by 12 kb and were 65.5 kb and 35 kb
apart, respectively, from the FUT1 gene. They concluded that SEC1 was a
pseudogene with translational frameshifts and termination codons
interrupting potential open reading frames that would otherwise share
primary sequence similarity with FUT1.

Reguigne-Arnould et al. (1995) pointed out that 5 of the 7
fucosyltransferase genes cloned to that time had been mapped to 2
clusters, 1 with FUT1 and FUT2 on 19q and the other with FUT6 (136836),
FUT3, and FUT5 (136835) on 19p. Linkage studies using microsatellite
markers and comparison of genetic and physical maps suggested that FUT1
and FUT2 loci are located on 19q13.3.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Data on gene frequencies of allelic variants were tabulated by
Roychoudhury and Nei (1988).

Kelly et al. (1995) found that approximately 20% of randomly selected
individuals were apparently homozygous for an enzyme-inactivating W143X
nonsense mutation (182100.0001) at the FUT2 locus, in correspondence
with the frequency of the nonsecretor phenotype in most human
populations. Furthermore, each of 6 unrelated nonsecretor individuals
were apparently homozygous for this null allele.

Kudo et al. (1996) discussed the possibility of a selective advantage
accounting for the development of different inactivating mutations of
the SEC2 gene in different ethnic groups (see 182100.0002). The absence
or presence of Lewis antigens, proven to be the product of Le and Se
genes, and antigen expression in digestive organs, may be biologically
much more important than expression in erythrocytes.

Koda et al. (1996) reviewed the molecular basis for the
secretor-negative phenotype in Japanese. The nonsense mutation of the
FUT2 gene, 428G-A (182100.0001), found in Caucasians and symbolized se1,
was not found. They found, however, a missense mutation, 385A-T
(182100.0002), designated se2, and 2 nonsense mutations (571C-T, se3,
and 628C-T, se4) in the Japanese Se enzyme-deficient allele. In
addition, Koda et al. (1996) found a fusion gene, which consisted of the
5-prime region of the pseudogene (FUT2P) and the 3-prime region of the
functional FUT2 gene, as an Se enzyme-deficient allele (se5). The DNA
sequence analysis of the fusion gene indicated that the crossover region
corresponded to regions between bases 253 and 313 of the pseudogene and
between bases 211 and 271 of the FUT2 gene. The findings suggested that
the fusion gene was generated by homologous but unequal crossover. A
population study on 141 randomly selected Japanese individuals indicated
to Koda et al. (1996) that se2 is a common Se enzyme-deficient allele in
the Japanese population and that secretor-deficient alleles are race
specific. Liu et al. (1999) investigated 5 populations from 3 ethnic
groups in East Asia for the fusion gene. The fusion gene was found at a
high frequency in 2 Japanese populations (0.0551 in Okinawa and 0.0792
in Akita), and at a very low frequency in a Korean population (0.0063 in
Seoul). No individuals with the fusion gene were identified among 292
patients from 2 Chinese populations. The authors suggested that the
fusion gene likely emerged from within the Japanese population, given
its high frequency in the Japanese but rare occurrence in neighboring
populations.

The common nonsecretor allele found in Caucasians (182100.0001) is
virtually absent in Taiwanese and mainland Chinese. In several groups
indigenous to Taiwan, the Le(a+b-) nonsecretor phenotype has been found,
as reviewed by Yu et al. (1999).

Koda et al. (1997) found that a 725T-G transversion in FUT1
(211100.0004), which results in an amino acid change, leu242 to arg, and
complete deletion of FUT2 (182100.0003) are responsible for the classic
Bombay phenotype.

Lindesmith et al. (2003) found that individuals who are homozygous for
the FUT2 G428A allele (182100.0001) in the ABH histo-blood group family
do not express the H type-1 oligosaccharide ligand required for Norwalk
virus binding. The FUT2 susceptibility allele is fully penetrant against
Norwalk virus infection as none of these individuals developed an
infection after challenge, regardless of dose. Of the susceptible
population that encoded a functional FUT2 gene, a portion was resistant
to infection, suggesting that a memory immune response or some other
unidentified factor also affords protection from Norwalk virus
infection.

Hazra et al. (2008) found a strong association between dbSNP rs492602 in
FUT2 and positive plasma vitamin B12 levels in a genomewide scan and an
independent replication sample from the Nurses' Health Study. Women
homozygous for the dbSNP rs492602 G allele had higher B12 levels. This
allele is in strong linkage disequilibrium with the FUT2 nonsecretor
variant encoding W143X (182100.0001), suggesting a plausible mechanism
for altered B12 absorption and plasma levels. This association was found
in a cohort of healthy women of European descent.

Tanaka et al. (2009) performed a genomewide association analysis to
identify genetic factors affecting circulating vitamin B12 levels and
identified dbSNP rs602662 in the FUT2 gene (p = 2.83 x 10(-20)) in
Italians in the InCHIANTI (1,175 participants), SardiNIA (1,115
participants), and BLSA (640 participants) studies. The top locus was
replicated in an independent sample from the 687 participants in the
Progetto Nutrizione study.

For discussion of a possible association between variation in the FUT2
gene and susceptibility to Crohn disease, see 266600.

ANIMAL MODEL

Falk et al. (1995) created transgenic mice with the human Le gene and
showed that Helicobacter pylori, a causative agent of gastric disorders,
attached to gastric epithelial cells in the transgenic mice but not in
their normal littermates. This implies that Le/Le individuals may have
an advantage in avoiding H. pylori infection (600263).

Using gene targeting in embryonic stem cells, Domino et al. (2001)
generated strains of mice that were deficient in Fut2. Fut2-null mice
developed normally and exhibited no gross phenotypic abnormalities.
Using immunohistochemistry, the authors observed that Fut2-null mice no
longer exhibited the wildtype expression pattern of
alpha(1,2)-fucosylated glycans in the uterine epithelium. However,
normal fertility was observed. Domino et al. (2001) concluded that
alpha(1,2)-fucosylated glycans play nonessential roles in blastocyst
implantation or sperm function in mice.

FUT2, TRP143TER

Kelly et al. (1995) found that a nonsense mutation involving codon 143
(numbered from the putative initiator methionine of the short FUT2
protein) is responsible for the nonsecretor phenotype. See also Rouquier
et al. (1995). The nonsense mutation was due to a G-to-A transition at
nucleotide 428. However, the trp143-to-ter mutation found in ethnic
groups other than Japanese was not found in any of 45 Japanese
nonsecretors. Instead, 2 novel mutations, a C-to-T transition at
nucleotide 357 and an A-to-T transversion at nucleotide 385 were found
in Japanese nonsecretors. The 357C-T mutation was silent insofar as
amino acid substitution was concerned; the 385A-T missense mutation
(182100.0002) resulted in inactivation of the
alpha(1,2)fucosyltransferase.

Lindesmith et al. (2003) showed that the nonsecretor status in
homozygosity prevents expression of the H type-1 oligosaccharide ligand
and is fully protective from Norwalk virus infection.

Hazra et al. (2008) found that 3 single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the
FUT2 gene, including dbSNP rs601338, which encodes the W143X variant,
are in strong linkage disequilibrium and are strongly associated with
plasma levels of vitamin B12 as a quantitative trait (B12QTL1; 612542).
Hazra et al. (2008) considered the W143X polymorphism to be a plausible
causal variant for this association.

In 1,174 Crohn disease (CD; 266600) cases and 357 controls, McGovern et
al. (2010) found association of the FUT2 W143X polymorphism and CD (p =
2.6 x 10(-5)).

SECRETOR/NONSECRETOR POLYMORPHISM, JAPANESE TYPE
FUT2, ILE129PHE

In the SE gene, designated SEC2 by Rouquier et al. (1995), Kudo et al.
(1996) found homozygosity for an A-to-T transversion at nucleotide 385,
resulting in a missense substitution ile129-to-phe in all Japanese
nonsecretor individuals. They referred to the mutant allele in Japanese
nonsecretors as sej; sej/sej homozygosity accounted for more than 15% of
the Japanese population. The inactivated sej allele had a frequency of
39% in the Japanese. Kudo et al. (1996) discussed the possibility of a
selective advantage accounting for the development of different
inactivating mutations of the SEC2 gene in different ethnic groups.

.0003
BOMBAY PHENOTYPE, CLASSIC
FUT2, DEL

In 3 unrelated individuals with the Bombay phenotype, Koda et al. (1997)
found that a 725T-G transversion in FUT1 (211100.0004), which results in
an amino acid change, leu242 to arg, and complete deletion of FUT2 were
responsible for the classic Bombay phenotype. The individuals lacked the
H antigen not only on blood cells but also in saliva, which prompted
Koda et al. (1997) to investigate the FUT2 gene in these persons. The
mutations in both genes were homozygous. The results of analyses of FUT1
and FUT2 by Koda et al. (1997) suggested that the homozygosity for these
2 unusual and linked genetic mutations is common in individuals with the
classic Bombay phenotype.

Koda et al. (2000) isolated the junction region of the deletion of FUT2
and found evidence that the deletion was generated by Alu-Alu
recombination.

612681	TITLE *612681 CUGBP- AND ELAV-LIKE FAMILY, MEMBER 6; CELF6
;;BRUNO-LIKE 6; BRUNOL6;;
CUGBP- AND ETR3-LIKE FACTOR 6
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the CELF family, such as CELF6, play various roles in
cotranscriptional and posttranscriptional RNA processing. All CELF
proteins appear to affect pre-mRNA splicing, but individual CELFs have
divergent roles in regulating mRNA stability and translation (summary by
Wagnon et al., 2012).

CLONING

By searching databases for human sequences similar to Xenopus Brunol1
(TNRC4; 612678), Good et al. (2000) identified BRUNOL6. The deduced
protein contains 2 N-terminal domain RNA-recognition motifs (RRMs), a
long linker region, and a C-terminal RRM.

By searching genomic sequences from CELF-like proteins, followed by PCR
of a human brain cDNA library, Ladd et al. (2004) cloned full-length
BRUNOL6, which they called CELF6. The deduced 481-amino acid protein has
a calculated molecular mass of 50.4 kD. CELF6 has 3 RRMs, with a
268-amino acid divergent domain separating RRM2 and RRM3. It also has
numerous potential phosphorylation sites, a potential nuclear
localization signal at the C terminus, and an alanine-rich region within
the divergent domain. Ladd et al. (2004) also identified 3 splice
variants of CELF6 that encode proteins with C-terminal truncations
compared with full-length CELF6 (isoform-1). Isoform-2 contains RRM1 and
part of RRM2, isoform-3, the shortest isoform, contains only RRM1, and
isoform-4 contains RRM1, RRM2, and part of the divergent domain.
Northern blot analysis detected 7.5- and 4.0-kb transcripts that were
abundantly expressed in kidney and brain, respectively. Both variants
were detected at low levels in several other tissues. RNA dot blot
analysis revealed highest CELF6 expression in adult kidney, brain, and
testis, with low expression in most other tissues. CELF6 was detected in
fetal brain, but only low expression was detected in fetal kidney.
Western blot analysis showed that full-length CELF6, isoform-2, and
isoform-4 were expressed in transfected quail fibroblasts, but isoform-3
was not detected, apparently due to protein instability.

GENE FUNCTION

CELF proteins (e.g., TNRC4; 612678) promote active exon inclusion of
cardiac troponin T (TNNT2; 191045) minigenes in vivo via muscle-specific
splicing enhancer (MSE) sequences. Ladd et al. (2004) showed that
full-length CELF6, isoform-2, and isoform-4 promoted exon inclusion from
these minigenes in a dose- and isoform-dependent manner. Full-length
CELF6 also promoted insulin receptor (INSR; 147670) exon 11 skipping in
a dose-dependent manner, similar to CUGBP (601074), whereas CELF6
isoform-4 showed weaker exon skipping potential, and isoform-2 had no
effect.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Good et al. (2000) mapped the BRUNOL6 gene
to chromosome 15q24.

300522	TITLE *300522 IQ MOTIF- AND SEC7 DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 2; IQSEC2
;;KIAA0522
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The IQSEC2 gene encodes a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the ARF
family of GTP-binding proteins (see, e.g., ARF1; 103180) (Shoubridge et
al., 2010).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) cloned IQSEC2, which they designated
KIAA0522. The deduced 1,560-amino acid protein shares weak homology with
rat Sec7a. RT-PCR detected high expression of IQSEC2 in brain, kidney,
and small intestine, and intermediate to low expression in placenta,
pancreas, ovary, prostate, and liver. No expression was detected in
other tissues examined.

Shoubridge et al. (2010) characterized 2 isoforms of the IQSEC2 gene
that are generated by alternative splicing. The longer isoform contains
15 exons and encodes a 1,488-residue protein, whereas the shorter
isoform contains 14 exons and encodes a 949-residue protein. The
proteins have 906 amino acids in common, which include the IQ, Sec7, and
PH functional domains, but vary at both the N and C termini. An
alternative transcript for the longer isoform, resulting in a
1,478-residue protein, was also proposed. Both the long and short
isoforms were expressed in fetal and adult human brain.

GENE FUNCTION

Filippova et al. (2005) determined that the mouse Iqsec2 gene is subject
to X inactivation, but human IQSEC2 escapes X inactivation. They
attributed this difference to the presence of a CTCF (604167)-binding
site at the 5-prime end of the upstream Jarid1c gene (314690) in mice
that is not present in humans.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the IQSEC2
gene to chromosome X. Filippova et al. (2005) noted that the mouse
Iqsec2 gene also maps to chromosome X. In both mice and humans, the
IQSEC2 gene lies between the JARID1C and SMC1A (300040) genes.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of 4 unrelated families with X-linked nonsyndromic
mental retardation (MRX1; 309530), Shoubridge et al. (2010) identified 4
different hemizygous mutations in the IQSEC2 gene
(300522.0001-300522.0004). Some carrier females had learning
disabilities. The authors suggested that a defect in the GTP-binding
activity of mutant IQSEC2 may influence the regulation of actin
cytoskeleton organization and neuronal development in the brain.

resulting in an arg863-to-trp (R863W) substitution affecting a conserved
residue in the Sec7 domain. The mutation was not found in 1,310 control
individuals. In vitro functional expression studies showed that the

compared to wildtype.

gln801-to-pro (Q801P) substitution affecting a conserved residue in the
Sec7 domain. The mutation was not found in 1,310 control individuals. In

significantly decreased GTP binding to ARF6 (600464) compared to
wildtype.

substitution affecting a conserved residue in the Sec7 domain. The
mutation was not found in 1,310 control individuals. In vitro functional
expression studies showed that the mutant protein had significantly
decreased GTP binding to ARF6 (600464) compared to wildtype.

transition in exon 4 of the IQSEC2 gene, resulting in an arg359-to-cys
(R359C) substitution affecting a conserved residue in the IQ-like
domain. The mutation was not found in 1,310 control individuals. In
vitro functional expression studies showed that the mutant protein
resulted in a decrease of GTP-bound ARF6 (600464).

602170	TITLE *602170 MYELOID DIFFERENTIATION PRIMARY RESPONSE GENE 88; MYD88
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MyD88 is a key downstream adapter for most Toll-like receptors (TLRs)
and interleukin-1 receptors (IL1Rs) (summary by Von Bernuth et al.,
2008).

CLONING

The myeloid differentiation (MyD) marker MyD88 was first characterized
during a study of the early genetic responses of murine myeloid cells to
various differentiation and growth inhibitory stimuli (Lord et al.,
1990). Myeloid differentiation primary response genes are activated in
M1 myeloleukemic cells in response to interleukin-6 (IL6; 147620), which
induces both growth arrest and terminal differentiation. Hardiman et al.
(1997) described the cloning of the mouse MyD88 gene. The first exon
encodes a complete 'death domain' similar to the intracellular segment
of TNF receptor-1 (191190). Zoo-blot analysis demonstrated that it is an
evolutionarily conserved gene. Northern blot analysis revealed
widespread expression of the gene in many adult mouse tissues, and
RT-PCR detected MyD88 mRNA in T- and B-cell lines and differentiating
embryonic stem cells. The broad expression pattern demonstrated that
mouse Myd88 expression is not restricted to cells of myeloid lineage as
was originally believed.

Bonnert et al. (1997) cloned a human MYD88 cDNA that encodes a 296-amino
acid polypeptide with a predicted mass of 33 kD. MYD88 shares 81% amino
acid identity with murine MyD88. The 150-amino acid C-terminal region
has significant homology to the type I interleukin-1 receptor (147810)
cytoplasmic domain. Northern blot analysis revealed that human MYD88 is
expressed as 2 MYD88 hybridizing 1.6- and 3-kb mRNAs in a variety of
tissues and cell lines.

Using immunofluorescence analysis, Kagan and Medzhitov (2006) found that
human MYD88 localized to discrete foci scattered throughout the cytosol
of transfected mouse embryonic fibroblasts and macrophages.

GENE FUNCTION

Bonnert et al. (1997) found that overexpression of MYD88 caused an
increase in the level of transcription from the interleukin-8 (146930)
promoter.

Muzio et al. (1997) reported that the C-terminal domain of MYD88 has
significant sequence similarity to the cytoplasmic domain of IL1RAP
(602626). They showed that ectopic expression of MYD88 strongly induced
NFKB (e.g., 164011) activity in a concentration-dependent manner. In
addition, the C-terminal region of MYD88 acted as a dominant-negative
inhibitor of IL1R1 (147810)/IL1RAP-induced NFKB activity. MYD88 formed
an immunoprecipitable complex with IL1RAP and with IRAK2 (603304).

Medzhitov et al. (1998) demonstrated that signaling by the human TOLL
receptor (see TLR4; 603030) employs an adaptor protein, MyD88, and
induces activation of NFKB via the IRAK (IRAK1; 300283) kinase and the
TRAF6 (602355) protein. The Toll-mediated signaling cascade using the
NFKB pathway is essential for immune responses in adult Drosophila, and
a human homolog of the Drosophila Toll protein induces various immune
response genes via this pathway. These findings implicate MyD88 as a
general adaptor/regulator molecule for the Toll/IL1R family of receptors
for innate immunity.

Hayashi et al. (2001) showed that expression of TLR5 (603031) induces
NFKB (see 164011) activation and TNFA (191160) production.
Pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) known to stimulate other
TLR family members failed to stimulate TLR5; however, luciferase
reporter assays indicated TLR5 activation in gram-positive and -negative
bacterial culture supernatants. By fractionation of Listeria culture
supernatants followed by SDS-PAGE, Hayashi et al. (2001) identified
flagellin as the TLR5 ligand. Flagellin, a principal component of
bacterial flagella, is a virulence factor recognized by the innate
immune system in plants, insects, and mammals. Expression of flagellin
in nonflagellated bacteria resulted in TLR5 activation, and deletion of
flagellin from flagellated bacteria abrogated TLR5 activation. Hayashi
et al. (2001) demonstrated that injection of flagellin induces the
production of IL6 (147620) in wildtype mice, but not in those lacking
the MyD88 adaptor protein, required for TLR signaling. Hayashi et al.
(2001) concluded that TLR5 is a pattern-recognition receptor and that
its PAMP is flagellin, a protein with conserved N and C termini in a
broad group of motile pathogens.

Burns et al. (2003) noted that a MYD88 splice variant encodes a protein,
MYD88s, lacking the 58-amino acid intermediary domain between the death
domain and the C-terminal TIR domain. MYD88s is detected only after
continuous stimulation with bacterial products, such as
lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or proinflammatory cytokines. Expression of
MYD88s blocks LPS- or IL1-induced NFKB activation, even though, like the
full-length protein, MYD88s binds both IL1R and IRAK1. By Western blot
analysis of a reconstituted MYD88 -/- cell line, Burns et al. (2003)
showed that MYD88, but not MYD88s, triggered IRAK1 phosphorylation and
NFKB activation in an IRAK4 (606883)-dependent manner. MYD88s did not
bind IRAK4 and blocked its recruitment to IL1Rs. Burns et al. (2003)
concluded that MYD88s acts as a negative regulator of IL1R/TLR/MYD88
signals, leading to a controlled negative regulation of innate immune
responses.

Diebold et al. (2004) confirmed that mouse plasmacytoid dendritic cells
(PDCs) expressing B220 (PTPRC; 151460) but not Cd11b (ITGAM; 120980)
were resistant to suppression of Ifna (147660) production mediated by
influenza virus NS1 protein, suggesting that PDCs use a
dsRNA-independent pathway for recognizing influenza. Chloroquine
inhibited influenza-induced Ifna production, indicating that recognition
of the virus occurs in the endosomal compartment. Ifna production in
response to live or inactivated influenza virus or to viral genomic or
host ssRNA required the presence of Myd88 and Tlr7 (300365), but not
other TLRs.

Kagan and Medzhitov (2006) found that human TIRAP (606252), a TLR
adaptor protein, recruited human MYD88 to the plasma membrane of
transfected mouse fibroblasts and macrophages. They proposed that TIRAP
functions primarily to recruit MYD88 to activated TLR4 to initiate
signal transduction.

Chen et al. (2007) found that the acute neutrophilic inflammatory
response to cell injury requires the signaling protein Myd88. Analysis
of the contribution of Myd88-dependent receptors to this response
revealed only a minor reduction in mice doubly deficient in Toll-like
receptor-2 (Tlr2; 603028) and Tlr4 (603030) and normal responses in mice
lacking Tlr1 (601194), Tlr3 (603029), Tlr6 (605403), Tlr7 (300365), Tlr9
(605474), or Tlr11 (606270) or the IL18 receptor (IL18R; 604494).
However, mice lacking IL1R (147810) showed a markedly reduced
neutrophilic inflammatory response to dead cells and tissue injury in
vivo as well as greatly decreased collateral damage from inflammation.
This inflammatory response required IL1-alpha (147760), and IL1R
function was required on non-bone-marrow-derived cells. Notably, the
acute monocyte response to cell death, which is thought to be important
for tissue repair, was much less dependent on the IL1R-Myd88 pathway.
Also, this pathway was not required for the neutrophil response to a
microbial stimulus. These findings suggested that inhibiting the
IL1R-MYD88 pathway in vivo could block the damage from acute
inflammation that occurs in response to sterile cell death, and do so in
a way that might not compromise tissue repair or host defense against
pathogens.

Cirl et al. (2008) showed that virulent bacteria, such as uropathogenic
E. coli and Brucella melitensis, secreted inhibitory homologs of TIR
domain-containing proteins (TCPs). These TCPs promoted intracellular
bacterial survival and kidney pathology after instillation of organisms
in mouse bladder. Bacterial TCPs impeded TLR signaling through MYD88 and
impaired innate host defense. Molecular epidemiologic analysis of
clinical isolates from patients with urinary tract infections further
supported the proposal that bacterial TCPs represent a class of
virulence factors.

Alu RNA accumulation due to DICER1 (606241) deficiency in retinal
pigmented epithelium (RPE) is implicated in geographic atrophy, an
advanced form of age-related macular degeneration (AMD; see 603075).
Using mouse and human RPE cells and mice lacking various genes, Tarallo
et al. (2012) showed that a DICER1 deficit or Alu RNA exposure activated
the NLRP3 (606416) inflammasome, triggering TLR-independent MYD88
signaling via IL18 (600953) in the RPE. Inhibition of inflammasome
components, MYD88, or IL18 prevented RPE degeneration induced by DICER1
loss or Alu RNA exposure. Because RPE in human geographic atrophy
contained elevated NLRP3, PYCARD, and IL18, Tarallo et al. (2012)
suggested targeting this pathway for prevention and/or treatment of
geographic atrophy.

Zhu et al. (2012) showed that the direct, immediate, and disruptive
effects of IL1-beta (IL1B; 147720) on endothelial stability in a human
in vitro cell model are NF-kappa-B (see 164011)-independent and are
instead the result of signaling through the small GTPase
ADP-ribosylation factor-6 (ARF6; 600464) and its activator ARF
nucleotide-binding site opener (ARNO; 602488). Moreover, Zhu et al.
(2012) showed that ARNO binds directly to the adaptor protein MYD88, and
thus proposed MYD88-ARNO-ARF6 as a proximal IL1-beta signaling pathway
distinct from that mediated by NF-kappa-B. Finally, Zhu et al. (2012)
showed that SecinH3 (182115), an inhibitor of ARF guanine nucleotide
exchange factors such as ARNO, enhances vascular stability and
significantly improves outcomes in animal models of inflammatory
arthritis and acute inflammation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hardiman et al. (1997) described the gene structure of the mouse MyD88
gene. The complete coding sequence spans 5 exons.

Bonnert et al. (1997) found that the human MYD88 gene is encoded by 5
exons.

MAPPING

By interspecific backcross mapping, Hardiman et al. (1997) localized the
mouse MyD88 gene to chromosome 9; the human homolog was mapped to
3p22-p21.3 by PCR analysis of a chromosome 3 somatic cell hybrid mapping
panel. Bonnert et al. (1997) used fluorescence in situ hybridization to
map the human MYD88 gene to 3p22-3p21.3.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Lin et al. (2010) reported the crystal structure of the MyD88-IRAK4
(606883)-IRAK2 (603304) death domain complex, which revealed a
left-handed helical oligomer that consists of 6 MyD88, 4 IRAK4, and 4
IRAK2 death domains. Assembly of this helical signaling tower is
hierarchical, in which MyD88 recruits IRAK4 and the MyD88-IRAK4 complex
recruits the IRAK4 substrates IRAK2 or the related IRAK1. Formation of
these myddosome complexes brings the kinase domains of IRAKs into
proximity for phosphorylation and activation. Composite binding sites
are required for recruitment of the individual death domains in the
complex, which are confirmed by mutagenesis and previously identified
signaling mutations. Specificities of myddosome formation are dictated
by both molecular complementation and correspondence of surface
electrostatics.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Von Bernuth et al. (2008) identified 3 different mutations in the MYD88
gene in children with MYD88 deficiency (612260) that resulted in
susceptibility to pyogenic bacterial infections. Four children from 3
kindreds were homozygous for in-frame deletion of glu52 (E52del;
602170.0001). Two sibs were homozygous for an arg196-to-cys (R196C;
602170.0002) mutation, and 1 child from another kindred was compound
heterozygous for the R196C mutation and a leu93-to-pro (L93P;
602170.0003) mutation. Two sibs who died in infancy were presumably
homozygous for the same E52del mutation found in their surviving
brother. The mutations were not found in healthy controls, and all
affected conserved residues. Fibroblast from patients representing the 3
combinations of mutant MYD88 alleles showed normal MYD88 mRNA levels.
Western blot analysis revealed low MYD88 protein levels with the
homozygous E52del mutation and the compound heterozygous L93P/R196C
mutation and normal MYD88 protein levels with the R196C homozygous
mutation. Functional analysis using patient fibroblasts and expression
of wildtype or mutant alleles in cell lines confirmed that all 3 MYD88
mutations resulted in loss of function and led to complete MYD88
deficiency. Von Bernuth et al. (2008) concluded that, like IRAK4
deficiency (607676), MYD88 deficiency abolishes most cytokine responses
to TLR stimulation. Von Bernuth et al. (2008) noted that the immunologic
phenotype of the 9 children they reported with MYD88 deficiency was
similar to that of Myd88-deficient mice, but the infectious phenotype
was different. The MYD88-deficient patients were susceptible to
Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Streptococcus
pneumoniae, but were normally resistant to most other infectious agents.
In contrast, Myd88-deficient mice had been shown to be susceptible to
almost all pathogens tested.

For a discussion of somatic MYD88 mutation in IgM monoclonal gammopathy
of undetermined significance (MGUS) and Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia,
see 602170.0004.

ANIMAL MODEL

Adachi et al. (1998) observed that mice with a targeted disruption of
the Myd88 gene were unable to respond to IL1 (e.g., 147760), as
determined by defective T-cell proliferation and the production of
cytokines. Likewise, Myd88-deficient mice were unable to produce
gamma-interferon (IFNG; 147570) and mediate natural killer cell activity
in response to IL18 (600953). NFKB activation in response to IL1 or IL18
was also impaired. These results indicated that MYD88 is a critical
component in the IL1R and IL18R (604494) signaling cascades. Kawai et
al. (1999) extended these studies to show that responses to
lipopolysaccharide, mediated by TLR4 and CD14 (158120), were lost or
delayed in Myd88-deficient mice, establishing that MYD88 is part of the
TLR signaling cascade as well, acting just upstream of IRAK.

Takeuchi et al. (2000) showed that Tlr2 (603028)- and, particularly,
Myd88-deficient mice are highly susceptible, in terms of growth in blood
and kidney and decreased survival, to infection with Staphylococcus
aureus compared to wildtype mice. In vitro, Tlr2-deficient macrophages
produced reduced TNF and interleukin-6 (IL6; 147620) in response to S.
aureus compared to wildtype or Tlr4-deficient macrophages, whereas
Myd88-deficient macrophages produced no detectable TNF or IL6. The
authors concluded that TLR2 and MYD88 are critical in the defense
against gram-positive bacteria.

Skerrett et al. (2004) found that Myd88-deficient mice were highly
susceptible to aerosol infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but not to
aerosol infection with S. aureus. They concluded that Myd88-dependent
signaling is essential for innate immunity to P. aeruginosa and is
dispensable for resistance to pulmonary S. aureus infection.

Using nonlethal microbial stimuli on Il12b (161561)-deficient mice,
Jankovic et al. (2002) showed that although Th1-type cytokine production
was diminished in the absence of Il12b, the pathogen-specific Cd4
(186940)-positive T cells that emerged nevertheless displayed an
Ifng-dominated lymphokine profile and failed to default to a Th2
phenotype. In mice lacking both Il12b and Il10 (124092), these Th1 cells
were protective. In contrast, in mice lacking Myd88, not only was a
normal Th2-type response to Schistosoma mansoni antigens developed, but,
in response to Toxoplasma gondii antigens, no Ifng was detected and the
mice defaulted to a Th2-type response. Jankovic et al. (2002) proposed
that microbial-induced Th1 polarization is determined during the initial
encounter of pathogens with pattern recognition receptors (e.g., TLRs)
on antigen-presenting cells. They concluded that IL12, however, does not
determine Th1 versus Th2 phenotype.

LaRosa et al. (2008) generated bone marrow chimeras in which T cells,
but not cells involved in innate immune responses, lacked Myd88. These
chimeric mice showed increased susceptibility to T. gondii disease,
developing fatal encephalitis within 30 days. They displayed reduced
Ifng production, and the increased susceptibility was independent of
Il1r and Il18r signaling. LaRosa et al. (2008) proposed that, in
addition to innate immunity, MYD88 expression is necessary in T cells
for prolonged resistance to pathogens.

Bjorkbacka et al. (2004) examined atherosclerotic lesion development in
uninfected Apoe (APOE; 107741) single-null mice and Apoe -/- Myd88 -/-
double-null mice, and found that the Myd88-deficient mice showed a
marked reduction in early atherosclerosis. Inactivation of the Myd88
pathway led to a reduction in atherosclerosis through a decrease in
macrophage recruitment to the artery wall that was associated with
reduced chemokine levels. The findings linked elevated serum lipid
levels to a proinflammatory signaling cascade that is also engaged by
microbial pathogens.

To examine whether Toll-like receptor signaling regulates phagocytosis,
Blander and Medzhitov (2004) compared macrophages from wildtype, Myd88
null, and Tlr2-Tlr4 (603030) double-null mice. Myd null and Tlr2-Tlr4
double-null macrophages were unresponsive to inactivated E. coli.
Blander and Medzhitov (2004) found that activation of the Toll-like
receptor signaling pathway by bacteria, but not apoptotic cells,
regulated phagocytosis at multiple steps including internalization and
phagosome maturation. Phagocytosis of bacteria was impaired in the
absence of Toll-like receptor signaling. Two modes of phagosome
maturation were observed, constitutive and inducible; their differential
engagement depended on the ability of the cargo to trigger Toll-like
receptor signaling.

Fremond et al. (2004) noted that previous investigations had suggested a
minor and redundant role for TLR2, TLR4, and TLR6 (605403) in the early
host response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection, but a more
important role in control of chronic infection. Using Myd88 -/- mice,
Fremond et al. (2004) investigated the role of MYD88, which most TLRs,
except TLR3 (603029), use as an intracellular adaptor, in resistance to
Mtb. Macrophages from Myd88 -/- mice had normal upregulation of
costimulatory molecules but reduced cytokine production in response to
Mtb infection. Myd88 -/- mice succumbed to a low-dose aerosol Mtb
infection in approximately 4 weeks, whereas Tnf -/- mice died within 3
weeks, and wildtype mice survived. Death was accompanied by
significantly reduced body weight, increased lung weight, and 2 logs
higher bacillary burden. Like Tnf -/- mice, Myd88 -/- mice developed
massive necrosis and infiltration of inflammatory cells, primarily
neutrophils and macrophages, in lungs. Although BCG vaccination failed
to elicit a delayed-type hypersensitivity response in Myd88 -/- mice, it
did induce antigen-specific Ifng production in splenocytes and also
protected the mice from acute Mtb infection. The Myd88 -/- mice could
not, however, durably control the infection. Fremond et al. (2004)
concluded that the MYD88-mediated signaling pathway is critically
involved in the development of innate, but not adaptive, immunity in
response to Mtb infection.

Using mice lacking Myd88 or various members of the IL1R/TLR superfamily,
Bellocchio et al. (2004) found that the Myd88-dependent pathway was
required for resistance to Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus.
Myd88 signaling could occur through distinct TLRs depending on the
fungal pathogen and the route of infection, and individual TLRs
activated specialized antifungal effector functions on neutrophils.
Myd88-dependent signaling in dendritic cells was crucial for priming the
antifungal Th1 response. Bellocchio et al. (2004) concluded that innate
and adaptive immunity to C. albicans and A. fumigatus requires the
coordinated action of distinct members of the IL1R/TLR superfamily
acting through MYD88.

To evaluate the role of TLRs in B-cell activation and antibody
production, Pasare and Medzhitov (2005) transferred purified B cells
from wildtype, Myd88-deficient, Tlr4-deficient, and Cd40
(109535)-deficient mice into B cell-deficient mu-MT mice, which have a
mutation in the Ighm gene (147020). They found that primary B-cell
activation, including induction of IgM, IgG1, and IgG2 responses, but
not IgE or, probably, IgA responses, required TLRs in addition to helper
T cells. In contrast, Cd40 was required for isotype switching.

Hyaluronan, an extracellular matrix glycosaminoglycan with a repeating
disaccharide structure, is produced after tissue injury, and impaired
clearance results in unremitting inflammation. Jiang et al. (2005) noted
that CD44 (107269) is essential for regulating turnover of hyaluronan,
but it is not required for expression of chemokines by macrophages after
lung injury. Using Tlr-deficient mouse macrophages, they found that
hyaluronan fragments stimulated Mip2 (CXCL2; 139110), Mip1a (CCL3;
182283), and Kc (CXCL1; 155730) in a Tlr2- and Tlr4-dependent manner
that also required Myd88. Mice deficient in Tlr2, Tlr4, or Myd88 showed
impaired transepithelial migration of inflammatory cells, but decreased
survival and enhanced epithelial cell apoptosis after lung injury. Lung
epithelial cell overexpression of high molecular mass hyaluronan
protected against acute lung injury and apoptosis, in part, through
TLR-dependent basal activation of NFKB. Jiang et al. (2005) concluded
that interaction of TLR2 and TLR4 with hyaluronan provides signals that
initiate inflammatory responses, maintain epithelial cell integrity, and
promote recovery from acute lung injury.

Mice genetically deficient in both Myd88 and Trif (607601) have a
complete lack of known Toll-like receptor signaling, thus allowing
assessment of Toll-like receptor dependence of antibody responses. Gavin
et al. (2006) used these double knockouts to investigate the role of
Toll-like receptor signaling in antibody responses to immunization and
the augmenting roles of 4 typical adjuvants (alum, Freund complete
adjuvant, Freund incomplete adjuvant, and monophosphoryl-lipid
A/trehalose dicorynomycolate adjuvant) to that response. Regardless of
adjuvant, these mice exhibited robust antibody responses. Gavin et al.
(2006) concluded that Toll-like receptor signaling does not account for
the action of classical adjuvants and does not fully explain the action
of strong adjuvant containing a Toll-like receptor ligand.

Brown et al. (2007) found that Myd88 -/- mice and Ptgs2 -/- mice
exhibited a profound inhibition of endothelial proliferation and
cellular organization within rectal crypts after injury. The effects of
injury in both mutant mouse strains could be rescued by exogenous
prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), suggesting that Myd88 signaling is upstream of
Ptgs2 and PGE2. In wildtype mice, the combination of injury and Myd88
signaling led to repositioning of a subset of Ptgs2-expressing stromal
cells from the mesenchyme surrounding the middle and upper crypts to an
area surrounding the crypt base adjacent to colonic epithelial
progenitor cells. Brown et al. (2007) concluded that the MYD88 and
prostaglandin signaling pathways interact to preserve epithelial
proliferation during injury, and that proper cellular mobilization
within the crypt niche is critical to repair after injury.

Apc (611731) Min/+ mice spontaneously develop intestinal tumors and, on
average, die within 6 months of age. Rakoff-Nahoum and Medzhitov (2007)
showed that deletion of Myd88 in Min/+ mice reduced morbidity and
mortality, as well as the size and numbers of intestinal polyps,
compared with sex- and age-matched controls. They concluded that
MYD88-dependent signaling controls the expression of several key
modifier genes of intestinal tumorigenesis and that MYD88 has a critical
role in both spontaneous and carcinogen-induced tumor development.

Wen et al. (2008) showed that specific pathogen-free NOD mice lacking
Myd88, an adaptor for multiple innate immune receptors that recognize
microbial stimuli, do not develop type 1 diabetes (222100). The effect
is dependent on commensal microbes because germ-free Myd88-negative NOD
mice develop robust diabetes, whereas colonization of these germ-free
Myd88-negative NOD mice with a defined microbial consortium
(representing bacterial phyla normally present in human gut) attenuates
type 1 diabetes. Wen et al. (2008) also found that Myd88 deficiency
changes the composition of the distal gut microbiota, and that exposure
to the microbiota of specific pathogen-free Myd88-negative NOD donors
attenuates type 1 diabetes in germ-free NOD recipients. Wen et al.
(2008) concluded that, taken together, their findings indicated that
interaction of the intestinal microbes with the innate immune system is
a critical epigenetic factor modifying type 1 diabetes predisposition.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MYD88 DEFICIENCY
MYD88, 3-BP DEL, 160GAG

Von Bernuth et al. (2008) identified a homozygous in-frame 3-bp (GAG)
deletion in exon 1 of the MYD88 gene, resulting in deletion of glu52
(E52del), in 4 children with functional MYD88 deficiency (612260). A
French patient with the E52del mutation died in infancy. Two sibs of a
Spanish Gypsy patient with the mutation also died in infancy and were
presumed to have the mutation. The surviving patients were 3.5 to 7
years old. All patients shared a history of susceptibility to pyogenic
bacterial infections caused by S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, or S.
pneumoniae. Functional analysis confirmed that the E52del mutation
resulted in loss of function.

.0002
MYD88 DEFICIENCY
MYD88, ARG196CYS

Von Bernuth et al. (2008) identified a homozygous 586C-T transition in
exon 3 of the MYD88 gene, resulting in an arg196-to-cys (R196C)
substitution, in 2 sibs from Portugal with functional MYD88 deficiency
(612260). These patients were 9 and 16 years old. Von Bernuth et al.
(2008) also identified an unrelated, 3-year-old patient from Turkey who
was compound heterozygous for the R196C mutation and a 278T-C transition
in exon 1 that resulted in a leu93-to-pro (L93P; 602170.0003)
substitution. All 3 patients shared a history of susceptibility to
pyogenic bacterial infections caused by S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, or S.
pneumoniae. Functional analysis confirmed that both mutations resulted
in loss of function.

MYD88, LEU265PRO (dbSNP rs38182641)

Ngo et al. (2011) described the dependence of activated B cell-like
(ABC) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCLs) on MYD88 and the discovery
of highly recurrent oncogenic mutations affecting MYD88 in ABC DLBCL
tumors. RNA interference screening revealed that MYD88 and the
associated kinases IRAK1 (300283) and IRAK4 (606883) are essential for
ABC DLBCL survival. High-throughput RNA resequencing uncovered MYD88
mutations in ABC DLBCL lines. Notably, 29% of ABC DLBCL tumors harbored
the same amino acid substitution, L265P, in the MYD88 Toll/IL1 receptor
(TIR) domain at an evolutionarily invariant residue in its hydrophobic
core. This mutation was rare or absent in other DLBCL subtypes and
Burkitt lymphoma (113970), but was observed in 9% of mucosa-associated
lymphoid tissue lymphomas. At a lower frequency, additional mutations
were observed in the MYD88 TIR domain, occurring in both the ABC and
germinal center B cell-like (GCB) DLBCL subtypes. Survival of ABC DLBCL
cells bearing the L265P mutation was sustained by the mutant but not the
wildtype MYD88 isoform, demonstrating that L265P is a gain-of-function
driver mutation. The L265P mutant promoted cell survival by
spontaneously assembling a protein complex containing IRAK1 and IRAK4,
leading to IRAK4 kinase activity, IRAK1 phosphorylation, NF-kappa-B (see
164011) signaling, JAK kinase (see 147795) activation of STAT3 (102582),
and secretion of IL6 (147620), IL10 (124092), and interferon-beta
(147640). Hence, Ngo et al. (2011) concluded that the MYD88 signaling
pathway is integral to the pathogenesis of ABC DLBCL, supporting the
development of inhibitors of IRAK4 kinase and other components of this
pathway for the treatment of tumors bearing oncogenic MYD88 mutations.

Treon et al. (2012) performed whole-genome sequencing of bone marrow
lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL) cells in 30 patients with Waldenstrom
macroglobulinemia (153600), with paired normal-tissue and tumor-tissue
sequencing in 10 patients. Sanger sequencing was used to validate the
findings from an expanded cohort of patients with LPL, those with other
B-cell disorders that have some of the same features as LPL, and healthy
donors. Among the patients with Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, Treon et
al. (2012) identified a somatic mutation, L265P (dbSNP rs38182641), in
samples from all 10 patients with paired tissue samples and in 17 of 20
samples from patients with unpaired samples. This T-to-C transition
predicted an amino acid change that triggers IRAK-mediated NF-kappa-B
signaling. Sanger sequencing identified MYD88 L265P in tumor samples
from 49 of 54 patients with Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia and in 3 of 3
patients with non-IgM-secreting lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL) (91% of
all patients with LPL). MYD88 L265P was absent in paired normal-tissue
samples from patients with Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia or non-IgM LPL
and in B cells from healthy donors and was absent or rarely expressed in
samples from patients with multiple myeloma, marginal-zone lymphoma, or
IgM monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance. Inhibition of MYD88
signaling reduced I-kappa-B-alpha (164008) and NF-kappa-B p65 (164014)
phosphorylation, as well as NF-kappa-B nuclear staining, in Waldenstrom
macroglobulinemia cells expressing MYD88 L265P. Similar results were
obtained when cells expressing MYD88 L265P were incubated with an
IRAK1/4 kinase inhibitor. Somatic variants in ARID1A (603024) in 5 of 30
patients (17%), leading to a premature stop or frameshift, were also
identified and were associated with an increased disease burden. In
addition, 2 of 3 patients with Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia who had
wildtype MYD88 had somatic variants in MLL2 (602113). Treon et al.
(2012) concluded that MYD88 L265P is a commonly recurring mutation in
patients with Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia that can be useful in
differentiating Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia and non-IgM LPL from
B-cell disorders that have phenotypic overlap.

Landgren and Staudt (2012) used Sanger sequencing to assess the status
of MYD88 L265P expression in patients with IgM monoclonal gammopathy of
undetermined significance (MGUS) and found expression of this variant in
5 of 9 patients. All of these patients had both clonal plasma cells and
clonal lymphocytes in bone marrow (lymphoplasmacytic precursor
neoplasm), suggesting to Landgren and Staudt (2012) that this mutation
is a precursor to Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia rather than
transformation from IgM MGUS to Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia. Treon et
al. (2012) commented that, to overcome the limitations of Sanger
sequencing, they developed an allele-specific polymerase chain reaction
(AS-PCR) assay to detect the MYD88 L265P mutation with a threshold
detection limit of 0.1% (approximately 100-fold better than that of
Sanger sequencing). They found that 88 of 96 patients with Waldenstrom
macroglobulinemia (92%) and 5 of 11 patients with IgM MGUS (45%), as
defined by consensus criteria, were positive for MYD88 L265P expression
by either conventional or quantitative AS-PCR assays. Treon et al.
(2012) concluded that IgM MGUS is heterogeneous and that MYD88 L265P is
probably a driver mutation toward Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia.

605703	TITLE *605703 VESICLE-ASSOCIATED MEMBRANE PROTEIN-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN A; VAPA
;;VAMP-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN A;;
VAMP-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN, 33-KD; VAP33
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SNAREs (see 603215) are compartmentally specific, cytoplasmically
oriented integral membrane proteins involved in the fusion of membranes
and the transport of intracellular proteins. Recognition of vesicles and
target membranes is mediated by v-SNAREs (e.g., VAMP8; 603177) and
t-SNAREs (e.g., SNAP23; 602534), respectively.

CLONING

By searching an EST database for human homologs of the Aplysia 33-kD
VAMP-associated protein (Vap33), Weir et al. (1998) identified a cDNA
encoding VAPA, which they termed VAP33. Sequence analysis predicted that
the 242-amino acid protein, which is 50% identical to the molluscan
sequence, contains 8 potential phosphorylation sites, an alpha-helical
coiled-coil domain, and a C-terminal transmembrane domain. Northern blot
analysis of mouse tissues detected a major 1.9-kb transcript and minor
3.9- and 7.1-kb transcripts in all tissues tested, with highest
expression in brain, testis, ovary, kidney and skeletal muscle. In
contrast, Vap33 expression is neuron specific in Aplysia.

Nishimura et al. (1999) identified cDNAs encoding VAPA and the 60%
homologous VAPB (605704). Northern blot analysis detected a 1.7-kb VAPA
transcript in all human tissues tested.

GENE FUNCTION

By Western blot analysis, Weir et al. (1998) showed that VAPA interacts
with VAMP1 (185880) and VAMP2 (185881) but not with SNAP25 (600322).

By SDS-PAGE analysis, Nishimura et al. (1999) demonstrated that the
transmembrane domain of recombinant VAPA interacted with VAPA and VAPB
fusion proteins.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the VAPA
gene to chromosome 18 (TMAP stSG49693).

;;CELL DIVISION CYCLE 2-LIKE 5; CDC2L5;;
CELL DIVISION CONTROLLER, CHOLINESTERASE-RELATED; CHED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Lapidot-Lifson et al. (1992) cloned a glioblastoma cDNA encoding a
protein related to the S. pombe cdc2 kinase. They designated the
predicted 418-amino acid protein CHED, for cholinesterase-related cell
division controller. The CHED protein shares 34 to 42% sequence identity
with human CDC2 (116940), S. cerevisiae Cdc28, and S. pombe Cdc2, 3
functionally interchangeable proteins. Northern blot analysis revealed
that CHED is expressed as 2.2- to 2.3-kb mRNAs in several fetal tissues
and tumor cell lines.

GENE FUNCTION

Using an antisense oligonucleotide, Lapidot-Lifson et al. (1992) found
that reduced CHED expression selectively inhibited megakaryocyte
development in murine bone marrow cultures but did not prevent other
hematopoietic pathways. Antisense mRNA inhibition of BCHE (177400)
expression had a similar effect. The authors suggested that CHED and
BCHE are interrelated components responsive to cholinergic signals in
the hematopoietic pathway. They stated that a link between cholinergic
signaling and cell division might be mediated through individual CDC
proteins in a cell lineage-specific manner.

MAPPING

Gross (2012) mapped the CDK13 gene to chromosome 7p14.1 based on an
alignment of the CDK13 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AJ297709) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

610104	TITLE *610104 MICRO RNA 125B1; MIR125B1
;;miRNA125B1;;
MIRN125B1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MicroRNAs, such as MIR125B, are small noncoding RNAs that regulate
target gene expression posttranscriptionally through basepairing with
their target mRNAs. MIR125B1 and MIR125B2 (610105) both encode
precursors of the same mature MIR125B sequence, but the precursors
differ in the sequences flanking the mature MIR125B sequence (Lee et
al., 2005).

CLONING

Using synthetic siRNAs designed against the loop region of both MIR125B1
and MIR125B2, Lee et al. (2005) determined that MIR125B2 was the source
of most of the miR125b they detected in human cell lines.

Using quantitative real-time PCR, Sonkoly et al. (2007) found ubiquitous
but variable expression of miR125B in human tissues. Highest expression
was in prostate, heart, cervix, brain, and bladder.

GENE FUNCTION

Using microarray analysis, Ciafre et al. (2005) found that expression of
MIR125B1 was significantly upregulated in primary glioblastomas compared
with normal peripheral brain tissue.

Using microarray analysis, van Rooij et al. (2006) identified miR125B
among a group of miRNAs upregulated in 2 independent mouse models of
cardiac hypertrophy. Northern blot analysis showed increased expression
of miR125B in idiopathic end-stage failing human hearts.

Laneve et al. (2007) found that MIRN9 (see 611186), MIRN125A (611191),
and MIRN125B were upregulated in a human neuroblastoma cell line by
retinoic acid. They identified the mRNA encoding t-NTRK3, a truncated
isoform of NTRK3 (191316), as a target of the 3 miRNAs. The 3-prime UTR
of the t-NTRK3 transcript has a binding site for MIRN9 and another for
both MIRN125A and MIRN125B, which share the same seed sequence. These
miRNAs repressed t-NTRK3 expression in an additive manner, and
downregulation of t-NTRK3 was critical for regulating neuroblastoma cell
growth. Consistent with their function, MIRN9, MIRN125A, and MIRN125B
were downmodulated in primary neuroblastoma tumors.

Using microarray analysis and quantitative real-time PCR, Sonkoly et al.
(2007) found that expression of miR125B was decreased in psoriasis (see
177900) and atopic eczema (see 603165) compared with normal human skin.

To investigate the functional consequences of heterozygous mutations in
ATM (607585), homozygous mutations in which cause ataxia-telangiectasia
(AT; 208900), Smirnov and Cheung (2008) compared the gene and microRNA
expression phenotypes of noncarriers, AT carriers, and AT patients. The
authors found that some expression phenotypes are more similar between
noncarriers and AT carriers compared to AT patients, as expected for a
recessive disorder. However, for some expression phenotypes, AT carriers
are more similar to the patients than to the noncarriers. Analysis of
one of these expression phenotypes, TNFSF4 (603594) level, allowed
Smirnov and Cheung (2008) to uncover a regulatory pathway in which ATM
regulates TNFSF4 expression through MIRN125B. In AT carriers and AT
patients, this pathway is disrupted. As a result, the level of MIRN125B
is lower and the level of its target gene, TNFSF4, is higher than in
noncarriers. A decreased level of MIRN125B is associated with breast
cancer, and an elevated level of TNFSF4 is associated with
atherosclerosis. Thus, Smirnov and Cheung (2008) concluded that their
findings provided a mechanistic suggestion for the increased risk of
breast cancer and heart disease in AT carriers.

Le et al. (2009) identified highly conserved miRNA response elements in
the 3-prime UTRs of zebrafish and human p53 (TP53; 191170) transcripts
and showed that MIR125B bound directly to these elements. MIR125B
repressed translation of endogenous p53, reduced expression of p53
target genes, and countered drug-induced apoptosis in human cells.
Knockdown of mir125b in zebrafish embryos resulted in severe
developmental defects, particularly accumulation of dead cells in the
brain, and loss of mir125b increased p53 protein and p53-dependent
apoptosis. Treatment of zebrafish embryos with DNA-damaging agents
resulted in downregulation of mir125b and a rapid increase in p53
protein. Le et al. (2009) concluded that MIR125B is an important
negative regulator of p53 and p53-induced apoptosis during development
and during the stress response.

MAPPING

Lee et al. (2005) stated that the MIRN125B1 gene maps to chromosome 11
and is located in the exon of an uncharacterized gene.

Ciafre et al. (2005) stated that the MIR125B1 gene maps to chromosome
11q24.1, where it lies in a cluster with the LET7A2 (612142) and MIR100
(613186) genes.

ANIMAL MODEL

Bousquet et al. (2010) found that inoculation of mice with
Mir125b-overexpressing hematopoietic mouse fetal liver cells resulted in
an elevated number of neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes and
macrocytic anemia. Within 12 to 29 weeks posttansplantation, half of the
inoculated mice succumbed to a hematologic malignancy, including
myeloproliferative neoplasm, B-cell acute lymphoid leukemia (B-ALL), and
T-cell acute lymphoid leukemia (T-ALL). The type of leukemia appeared to
be related to the level of Mir125b expression, with lower expression in
T-ALL and higher expression in myeloid neoplasm. Overexpression of
Mir125b also accelerated the development of BCR (151410)/ABL
(189980)-induced leukemia in mice.

601155	TITLE *601155 MINOR HISTOCOMPATIBILITY ANTIGEN HA-1; HMHA1
;;HISTOCOMPATIBILITY (MINOR) HA-1;;
HLA-HA1;;
KIAA0223
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Cytotoxic T lymphocytes directed against minor histocompatibility
antigens of the host were demonstrated in blood from recipients of bone
marrow from donors who were genotypically HLA identical. Clones of such
cytotoxic T cells were isolated from lymphocyte populations in the blood
of patients with severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD; see 614395).
These clones were used as reagents to identify 5 nonsex-linked minor
histocompatibility antigens, designated HA-1, -2 (600642) , -3, -4, and
-5 by van Els et al. (1992). Most of the cytotoxic-T-cell clones
isolated from various patients reacted against HA-1 (van Els et al.,
1992). Goulmy et al. (1996) stated that for immune recognition, the
HA-1, -2, -4, and -5 antigens must be presented to cytotoxic T cells by
the major histocompatibility antigen HLA-A2. In this way, they behave
like antigens recognized in an HLA-restricted fashion. The HA-1 antigen
is present in 69% of normal people who express HLA-A2, whereas the
frequencies of the 3 others in this set of HLA-A2-restricted minor
histocompatibility antigens are either high (95% for HA-2); or low (16%
of HA-4 and 7% for HA-5). The HLA-1-restricted minor histocompatibility
antigen HA-3 occurs in 88% of persons positive for HLA-A1. HA-1, -2, -4,
and -5 are inherited independently of the HLA genes; each of them is
encoded by a single gene, and none has a locus within the HLA region
(Schreuder et al., 1993).

GENE FUNCTION

To investigate whether mismatching of minor histocompatibility antigens
contributes to acute GVHD in recipients of genotypically HLA-identical
bone marrow, Goulmy et al. (1996) studied 148 bone marrow recipients and
their sib donors. Fifty pairs were positive for HLA-A1, 117 were
positive for HLA-A2, and 19 were positive for both. The pairs were typed
with cytotoxic-T-cell clones specific for HA-1, -2, -3, -4, and -5. A
mismatch of only HA-1 was significantly correlated with GVHD of grade II
or higher in adults.

Den Haan et al. (1998) identified HA-1 as a nonapeptide derived from a
partial cDNA sequence, designated KIAA0223, derived from the acute
myelogenous leukemia KG-1. HA-1 has the amino acid sequence VLHDDLLEA,
termed HA-1(H). A single amino acid substitution of arginine for
histidine leads to HA-1-negative status, termed HA-1(R). Den Haan et al.
(1998) found that HA-1(H) is presented by its recognizing antigen,
HLA-A*0201, while HA-1(R) is not. The binding affinity of the HA-1(R)
peptide for HLA-A*0201 is 1/12 that of HA-1(H). The authors concluded
that HA-1(R) is a null allele and that only bone marrow transplantation
from an HA-1(R/R) donor to an HA-1(H/H) or HA-1(H/R) recipient, and not
the reverse, would be significantly associated with GVHD. Den Haan et
al. (1998) suggested that HA-1 typing before bone marrow transplantation
of HLA-matched donor-recipient combinations would improve bone marrow
donor selection and prediction of HA-1-induced GVHD.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kaminski et al. (2000) determined that the HA-1 gene contains 23 exons
and spans 16 kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1996) mapped the KIAA0223
gene to chromosome 19. Kaminski et al. (2000) mapped the HA-1 gene to
chromosome 19p13.3 based on sequence identity shared with a BAC clone
mapped to 19p13.3.

600108	TITLE *600108 MATRIX METALLOPROTEINASE 13; MMP13
;;COLLAGENASE 3; CLG3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Freije et al. (1994) cloned a cDNA coding for a novel human matrix
metalloproteinase (MMP) from a cDNA library derived from a breast tumor.
The isolated cDNA contains an open reading frame coding for a
polypeptide of 471 amino acids. The predicted protein sequence displays
extensive similarity to previously known MMPs and presented all the
structural features characteristic of this protein family, including the
well-conserved PRCGXPD motif. In addition, it contains in its amino acid
sequence several residues specific to the collagenase subfamily (tyr214,
asp235, and gly237) and lacks the 9-residue insertion present in the
stromelysins. Because of the structural characteristics, Freije et al.
(1994) called the new MMP collagenase-3 (CLG3), since it represented the
third member of this family, composed of fibroblast (MMP1; 120353) and
neutrophil (MMP8; 120355) collagenases. Northern blot analysis of RNA
from normal and pathologic tissues demonstrated the existence in breast
tumors of 3 different mRNA species, which seemed to be the result of
utilization of different polyadenylation sites present in the 3-prime
noncoding region of the gene. By contrast, no CLG3 mRNA was detected
either by Northern blot or RNA polymerase chain reaction analysis with
RNA from other human tissues, including normal breast, mammary
fibroadenomas, liver, placenta, ovary, uterus, prostate, and parotid
gland. A possible role for this metalloproteinase in the tumoral process
was proposed.

GENE FUNCTION

Freije et al. (1994) expressed CLG3 cDNA in a vaccinia virus system and
found that the recombinant protein was able to degrade fibrillar
collagens, providing support to the idea that it codes for an authentic
collagenase.

Mitchell et al. (1996) concluded that the expression of MMP13 in
osteoarthritic cartilage and its activity against type II collagen
indicates that the enzyme plays a significant role in cartilage collagen
degradation and must, therefore, form part of a complex target for
proposed therapeutic interventions based on collagenase inhibition.
Reboul et al. (1996) likewise presented data on collagenase-3 expression
and synthesis in human cartilage cells and suggested its involvement in
human osteoarthritis cartilage pathophysiology.

Lausch et al. (2009) suggested that there is a functional link between
MMP13 and MMP9 (120361) in the endochondral ossification, as impaired
MMP9 protein function, caused by direct inactivation (in recessive
disease due to MMP9 loss of function), impaired activation (in recessive
disease due to MMP13 loss of function), or transcatalytic degradation
(in dominant disease caused by MMP13 gain of function) appears to be a
common downstream step in the pathogenesis of metaphyseal anadysplasia.

GENE STRUCTURE

Pendas et al. (1997) reported that the MMP13 gene contains 10 exons and
spans approximately 12.5 kb. The overall gene organization is similar to
those of other MMP genes, including MMP1, MMP7 (178990), and MMP12
(601046).

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Pendas et al. (1995) localized
the CLG3 gene (also symbolized MMP13) to 11q22.3. Physical mapping of a
YAC clone containing CLG3 revealed that this gene is tightly linked to
those genes encoding other matrix metalloproteinases, including
fibroblast collagenase (MMP1), stromelysin-1 (MMP3; 185250), and
stromelysin-2 (MMP10; 185260). Further mapping of this region using
pulsed field gel electrophoresis showed that the CLG3 gene is located on
the telomeric side of the matrix metalloproteinase cluster. Pendas et
al. (1995) found the relative order of the loci to be
cen--STMY2--CLG1--STMY1--CLG3--tel. Pendas et al. (1996) isolated a
1.5-Mb YAC clone mapping to 11q22. Detailed analysis of this nonchimeric
YAC clone ordered 7 MMP genes as follows:
cen--MMP8--MMP10--MMP1--MMP3--MMP12--MMP7--MMP13--tel.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

The spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasias (SEMDs) are a heterogeneous group
of skeletal disorders featuring defective growth and modeling of the
spine and long bones. In affected members of a family segregating the
Missouri type of SEMD (602111) originally described by Patel et al.
(1993), Kennedy et al. (2005) identified heterozygosity for a missense
mutation (F56S; 600108.0001) in the MMP13 gene. Kennedy et al. (2005)
predicted, by modeling MMP13 structure, that the F56S mutation would
result in a hydrophobic cavity with misfolding, autoactivation, and
degradation of mutant protein intracellularly. Expression of wildtype
and mutant MMP13s in human embryonic kidney cells confirmed abnormal
intracellular autoactivation and autodegradation of F56S MMP13 such that
only enzymatically inactive, small fragments were secreted. Thus, the
F56S mutation results in deficiency of MMP13, which leads to the human
skeletal developmental anomaly seen in the Missouri form of SEMD.

Lausch et al. (2009) investigated the molecular basis of metaphyseal
anadysplasia in 5 families and identified heterozygous (see
600108.0002-600108.0003) or homozygous (600108.0004) mutations in the
MMP13 gene in 4; see MANDP1 (602111). In the fifth family, they
identified a mutation in the MMP9 gene (120361.0002); see MANDP2
(613073). Lausch et al. (2009) found that recessive metaphyseal
anadysplasia is caused by homozygous loss of function of either MMP9 or
MMP13, whereas dominant metaphyseal anadysplasia is caused by missense
mutations in the prodomain of MMP13 that determine autoactivation of
MMP13 and intracellular degradation of both MMP13 and MMP9, resulting in
a double enzymatic deficiency.

ANIMAL MODEL

By gene targeting, Inada et al. (2004) created Mmp13-null mice.
Homozygous null mice were born at predicted mendelian ratios and
appeared healthy at birth. However, mutant mice showed profound defects
in growth plate cartilage, with markedly increased hypertrophic domains,
as well as delayed endochondral ossification and formation and
vascularization of primary ossification centers. Absence of Mmp13
resulted in significant interstitial collagen accumulation due, in part,
to lack of collagenase-mediated cleavage that normally occurs in growth
plates and primary ossification centers. Cartilaginous growth plate
abnormalities persisted in adult mice and phenocopied defects observed
in human hereditary chondrodysplasias.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
SPONDYLOEPIMETAPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA, MISSOURI TYPE
MMP13, PHE56SER

In the Missouri family with spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia (602111)
originally described by Patel et al. (1993), Kennedy et al. (2005)
demonstrated that the disorder was caused by a 252T-C transition in
codon 56 of the MMP13 gene that resulted in substitution of serine for
an evolutionarily conserved phenylalanine residue (F56S) in the
proregion domain of the protein.

.0002
METAPHYSEAL ANADYSPLASIA 1, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
MMP13, PHE55SER

In 3 affected members of a German family segregating a dominant form of
metaphyseal anadysplasia (see 602111), Lausch et al. (2009) identified
heterozygosity for a 249-C transition in the MMP13 gene, resulting in a
phe55-to-ser (F55S) substitution in the prodomain. The mutation was not
found among 228 alleles of ancestry-matched unaffected individuals.

.0003
METAPHYSEAL ANADYSPLASIA 1, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
MMP13, MET72THR

In 7 patients from 2 families, one German and the other Japanese,
segregating a dominant form of metaphyseal anadysplasia (see 602111),
Lausch et al. (2009) identified heterozygosity for a 300T-C transition
in exon 2 of the MMP3 gene, resulting in an met72-to-thr (M72T)
substitution in the prodomain. The mutation was not present among 228
alleles of ancestry-matched unaffected individuals.

.0004
METAPHYSEAL ANADYSPLASIA 1, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
MMP13, HIS213ASN

In a Moroccan patient with metaphyseal anadysplasia (see 602111), whose
family was consanguineous, Lausch et al. (2009) identified homozygosity
for a 722C-A transition in exon 5 of the MMP13 gene, which changed the
highly conserved histidine 213 of the catalytic domain to asparagine
(H213N) in the predicted open reading frame of proMMP13. The parents
were heterozygous for the mutation and unaffected sibs were either
heterozygous or homozygous wildtype. The mutation was not found among
228 alleles of unaffected controls.

272460	TITLE #272460 SPONDYLOCARPOTARSAL SYNOSTOSIS SYNDROME; SCT
;;SPONDYLOCARPOTARSAL SYNDROME;;
SYNSPONDYLISM, CONGENITAL;;
VERTEBRAL FUSION WITH CARPAL COALITION;;
SCOLIOSIS, CONGENITAL, WITH UNILATERAL UNSEGMENTED BAR
DESCRIPTION A number sign (#) is used with this entry because spondylocarpotarsal
synostosis syndrome is caused by mutation in the gene encoding filamin B
(FLNB; 603381) on chromosome 3p14.3.

CLINICAL FEATURES

Wiles et al. (1992) used the designation congenital synspondylism for a
form of congenital familial extensive vertebral anomalies (CFEVA). They
suggested that this represents an entity separate from spondylocostal
dysplasia (SCD; 122600) and spondylothoracic dysplasia (STD; 277300).
They reported 2 brothers and an unrelated girl who had an unusual
constellation of vertebral fusions without rib anomalies as well as
carpal coalition. By analogy to symphalangism (185800), they chose the
designation synspondylism. The 2 brothers had Lebanese parents born in
the same district of Lebanon but not known to be consanguineous. Two
sibs with apparently the same disorder were reported by Langer and Moe
(1975) and by Akbarnia and Moe (1978). Scoliosis was a more impressive
feature than in the case of the Lebanese brothers reported by Wiles et
al. (1992). Akbarnia and Moe (1978) referred to the condition as
'familial congenital scoliosis with unilateral unsegmented bar.' Their
patients were an Iranian brother and sister whose parents were first
cousins. Both showed right thoracic lordoscoliosis with failure of
segmentation on the left from the third to the eleventh thoracic
vertebra. Both had clubfeet as well as partial coalition of the carpal
bones. Ventruto and Catani (1986) described 2 Italian brothers, aged 16
and 8 years, who had 8 normal sibs and whose gypsy parents were first
cousins. The unilateral unsegmented fusion bar was on the left in the
older brother and on the right in the younger brother. Ventruto and
Catani (1986) were impressed by the presence of joint laxity, congenital
inguinal hernias, clubfoot, and peculiar facies (hypertelorism, short
nasal septum, and broad bridge and tip of the nose).

Langer et al. (1994) reported 6 additional patients, 2 of them sibs.
They used the term spondylocarpotarsal synostosis syndrome, with or
without unilateral unsegmented bar, because carpal synostosis, usually
capitate-hamate and lunate-triquetrum, was a feature and tarsal
synostoses were present in all patients in whom the feet had been
radiographed. The patients were of short stature, with
disproportionately short trunk. The feet were flat. Cleft palate and
sensorineural or mixed hearing loss were variable manifestations. Wiles
et al. (1992) gave a useful review of several types of congenital
familial extensive vertebral anomalies, including the costovertebral
segmentation defect with mesomelia (COVESDEM syndrome; 268310).

Coelho et al. (1998) described 3 patients (2 of them sibs born to
first-cousin parents) with spondylocarpotarsal synostosis syndrome.
Sensorineural deafness was found in 2 of the 3 patients. Of 18 reported
patients, including these 3, 10 were sib pairs from 5 families, with
first-cousin consanguinity of parents in 3.

Seaver and Boyd (2000) reported a sporadic case, which they stated
brought the number of well-documented cases of spondylocarpotarsal
synostosis to 19 and was the first case documenting cervical spine
instability. The 5-year-old girl had hypoplasia of C1 and odontoid and
subluxation of C2 on C3.

Steiner et al. (2000) reported a Brazilian family with
spondylocarpotarsal synostosis. The parents were first cousins and had
10 children, 5 of whom were affected. The 3 described in the report had
short-trunk dwarfism of postnatal onset, scoliosis, unsegmented thoracic
vertebrae with unilateral bar, and carpal bone fusion. Lens opacities,
rarefaction of retinal pigmentation, and narrowing of retinal vessels
were seen in 2 patients. These ocular manifestations may be coincidental
or represent previously undescribed findings in this condition.

Mitter et al. (2008) described a 5-year-old German boy, born of
first-cousin parents, with spondylocarpotarsal synostosis and a mutation
in the FLNB gene (603381.0013). In addition to the typical findings of
this disorder, he demonstrated ossification delay of multiple epiphyses
(especially delayed carpal bone age) and bilateral proximal femoral
epiphyseal dysplasia. Similar radiographic findings were described in
another boy with spondylocarpotarsal synostosis reported by Honeywell et
al. (2002).

Brunetti-Pierri et al. (2008) reported an Italian girl, born of
consanguineous parents, with spondylocarpotarsal synostosis syndrome due
to a homozygous FLNB mutation (603381.0014). She had short stature,
scoliosis, short trunk, delayed bone age, vertebral fusions, and
capitate-hamate fusion. She did not have facial dysmorphic features.
Growth hormone (GH) deficiency was documented, but there was no response
to GH administration. MRI did not show any abnormality of the
hypothalamo-pituitary area, but there was platybasia and basilar
impression, stenosis of the foramen magnum, but no signs of medullary
compression at the cervicomedullary junction. A younger brother, who was
heterozygous for the mutation, had short stature and transient GH
deficiency.

INHERITANCE

Autosomal recessive inheritance of spondylocarpotarsal synostosis
syndrome was confirmed by the finding of homozygous or compound
heterozygous mutations in the FLNB gene (603381) in patients with the
disorder.

MAPPING

In a study of 4 families with spondylocarpotarsal synostosis syndrome, 3
of which were consanguineous, Steiner et al. (2004) used linkage
analysis to establish that the disease gene is located on chromosome
3p14. A common region of homozygosity was found between markers D3S3724
and D3S1300 on 3p, defining a physical interval of approximately 4
million bp.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 4 unrelated SCT families, Krakow et al. (2004) found that affected
individuals were either homozygous or compound heterozygous for nonsense
mutations in the FLNB gene (603381). In all 4 families, the segregation
of the mutations was compatible with autosomal recessive inheritance.
The premature stop codons all were located within the repeat domain of
filamin B, and Krakow et al. (2004) concluded that SCT results from the
absence or truncation of filamin B.

HETEROGENEITY

Isidor et al. (2008) described a mother and her son with clinical and
radiologic criteria for spondylocarpotarsal synostosis syndrome.
Molecular analysis failed to identify mutations in the FLNB or the NOG
gene (602991). Isidor et al. (2008) suggested that SCT is genetically
heterogeneous and that both dominant and autosomal recessive forms of
inheritance should be considered.
