;;ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 262; ZNF262;;
KIAA0425
CELL DEATH-INHIBITING RNA, INCLUDED; CDIR, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Ishikawa et al. (1997) cloned ZNF262, which they designated
KIAA0425. The deduced protein contains 1,224 amino acids. RT-PCR
detected variable ZNF262 expression in all tissues examined, with
highest expression in kidney and lowest expression in spleen.

By searching an EST database for sequences encoding zinc finger-like
proteins, Smedley et al. (1999) identified ZNF262. The deduced protein
contains 5 tandem myeloproliferative and mental retardation (MYM)
motifs, conserved motifs that closely resemble zinc-binding sequences.
Northern blot analysis detected variable expression of several ZNF262
transcripts in all tissues examined, with highest expression in heart,
skeletal muscle, kidney, and liver.

By screening for cDNAs that inhibited interferon-gamma (147570)-induced
cell death in HeLa cells, Shchors et al. (2002) obtained a
441-nucleotide ZNF262 splice variant that they called CDIR. CDIR
contains only nucleotides 4,416 through 4,856 from the 3-prime UTR of
the full-length 6,108-nucleotide ZNF262 transcript. CDIR has a short ORF
encoding a putative 70-amino acid peptide and 14 stretches of 3 or more
consecutive U nucleobases characteristic of a U- or AU-rich element.

GENE FUNCTION

Shchors et al. (2002) showed that expression of CDIR in HeLa cells
inhibited interferon-gamma-induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner.
Domain analysis revealed that only full-length CDIR, and not its
isolated 3-prime or 5-prime ends or ORF, confers resistance to cell
killing. Mutation analysis revealed that the U-rich motifs AUUUUC and
UUUCAUUUU are required for this protection. Resistance to cell killing
was accompanied by elevated levels of p21 (CDKN1A; 116899) and BCL2
(151430) mRNA and protein. In vitro RNA-protein binding assays and
Western blot analysis revealed that HSP27 (HSPB1; 602195) and all
isoforms of AUF1 (HNRNPD; 601324) are components of a protein complex
that binds CDIR. Use of recombinant proteins revealed that AUF1, but not
HSP27, directly bound CDIR. Transfection of HeLa cells with another AUF1
target, the 3-prime UTR of MYC (190080), also inhibited
interferon-gamma-induced cell killing, but in a limited manner. Shchors
et al. (2002) concluded that the antiapoptotic effect of CDIR is due to
the sequestration of AUF1 by CDIR, resulting in elevated levels and
activity of p21 and BCL2.

MAPPING

Using fluorescence in situ hybridization and genomic sequence analysis,
Smedley et al. (1999) and Sohal et al. (1999) independently mapped the
ZNF262 gene to chromosome 1p34-p32.
