614768	TITLE *614768 TRANSMEMBRANE PROTEIN 66; TMEM66
;;SOCE-ASSOCIATED REGULATORY FACTOR; SARAF
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TMEM66 downregulates store-operated calcium entry (SOCE), a cellular
process of calcium influx in response to depleted endoplasmic reticulum
(ER) calcium stores (Palty et al., 2012).

CLONING

By screening a heart cDNA library for clones that reduced mitochondrial
calcium content following transfection of HEK293 cells, Palty et al.
(2012) identified TMEM66, which they called SARAF. The deduced 339-amino
acid protein has an N-terminal signal sequence, followed by a predicted
ER-luminal-facing domain, a transmembrane domain, a serine-proline-rich
cytoplasmic-facing domain, and a C-terminal cluster of basic residues.
Palty et al. (2012) also cloned a SARAF splice variant lacking exon 2
that encodes an N-terminally truncated protein with only the
transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains.

GENE FUNCTION

SOCE is mediated by STIM (see STIM1, 605921), which functions as an ER
Ca(2+) sensor, and ORAI (ORAI1; 610277), which functions as an
activatable Ca(2+) channel at the plasma membrane. Upon ER Ca(2+)
depletion, STIM dimerizes and translocates to the plasma membrane
opening ORAI Ca(2+) channels for restoration of intracellular Ca(2+)
stores. Palty et al. (2012) found that SARAF is a negative regulator of
SOCE. Overexpression of SARAF lowered basal mitochondrial Ca(2+) and ER
Ca(2+) levels in transfected human cell lines. In contrast, knockdown of
SARAF via small interfering RNA in HeLa or Jurkat cells elevated basal
cytosolic and ER calcium levels. Both long and short isoforms of SARAF
and the isolated SARAF C-terminal domain interacted with STIM1 and was
translocated with STIM1 to the plasma membrane, where it countered
STIM1-dependent Ca(2+) channel opening. Knockdown of SARAF resulted in
elevated plasma membrane localization of STIM1 and elevated basal
cytoplasmic Ca(2+) concentration. SARAF appeared to function by
inhibiting STIM1 dimerization.

MAPPING

Hartz (2012) mapped the TMEM66 gene to chromosome 8p12 based on an
alignment of the TMEM66 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF100748) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

610635	TITLE *610635 COLLAGEN TRIPLE-HELIX REPEAT-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1; CTHRC1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CTHRC1 is specifically expressed in vascular calcifications of carotid
artery lesions and may contribute to vascular remodeling of injured
arteries (Pyagay et al., 2005).

CLONING

By suppressive subtractive hybridization to identify genes
preferentially expressed in balloon-injured rat arteries, Pyagay et al.
(2005) cloned Cthrc1. Using 5-prime RACE, they cloned human CTHRC1 from
smooth muscle cell RNA. The deduced 243-amino acid human protein has an
N-terminal signal peptide and a short collagen (see COL1A1; 120150)
domain containing gly-X-Y repeats. Northern blot analysis revealed
Cthrc1 expression in rat lung and brain, with much lower levels in other
tissues examined. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry
localized rat Cthrc1 mRNA and protein to blood vessel adventitia at 8
and 14 days after balloon injury, with lower levels in developing
neointima. Significantly less Cthrc1 mRNA expression was detected 4
weeks after injury. Rat Cthrc1 protein was not detected in normal
arteries. Immunohistochemistry of human carotid artery lesion
endarterectomy samples detected CTHRC1 in vascular calcifications,
particularly at the outer margins of the calcification fronts, and in
chondrocyte-like cells surrounding the calcified tissue. Human CTHR1 was
not detected in noncalcified plaque regions.

GENE FUNCTION

By SDS-PAGE, glycosidase treatment, and collagenase analysis, Pyagay et
al. (2005) found that in vitro translated rat Cthrc1 was glycosylated
and formed a trimer, rendering it susceptible to cleavage by collagenase
(see 120353). Endogenous Cthrc1 mRNA levels increased in NIH3T3 mouse
fibroblasts following stimulation with BMP4 (112262) or TGFB1 (190180).
Scratch wound assays using Cthrc1-overexpressing rat smooth muscle cells
and mouse primary embryonic fibroblasts showed that Cthrc1 promoted cell
migration.

Yamamoto et al. (2008) found that Cthrc1 -/- mice appeared normal and
were fertile, but Cthrc1 -/- Vangl2 (600533) +/- mice displayed defects
in planar cell polarity comparable to those in Vangl2 -/- mice,
including midbrain neural tube closure defects and misorientation of
cochlear sensory hair cells. Since planar cell polarity requires Wnt
signaling, Yamamoto et al. (2008) examined interaction of mouse Cthrc1
with several components of the Wnt signaling pathway in transfected
HEK293T cells. They found that cell surface-anchored Cthrc1 bound to
specific Wnt proteins (e.g., WNT3A; 606359), Fzd proteins (e.g., FZD3;
606143), and Ror2 (602337), and that Cthrc1 enhanced the interaction of
Wnt proteins with Fzd-Ror2 by forming the Cthrc1-Wnt-Fzd-Ror2 complex.
Consistent with these findings, Ror2 -/- mice also showed planar cell
polarity-related abnormalities in the inner ear. Yamamoto et al. (2008)
concluded that CTHRC1 is a Wnt cofactor that selectively activates the
Wnt/planar cell polarity pathway by stabilizing ligand-receptor
interaction.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the CTHRC1
gene to chromosome 8 (TMAP RH102528).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Orloff et al. (2011) identified a germline gln44-to-pro (Q44P;
610635.0001) mutation in the CTHRC1 gene in 1 (1.1%) of 116 patients of
European descent with Barrett esophagus and/or esophageal adenocarcinoma
(614266). The mutation was not found in 125 controls. The same mutation
was found in 1 (1.7%) of 58 independent cases in a replication study.
This genomic region was studied after being identified by genomewide
linkage analysis of 21 concordant and 11 discordant sib pairs with the
disorder. Orloff et al. (2011) suggested that variation in the CTHRC1
gene may be important in the host tissue repair response to
gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD; 109350).

;;WOLF-HIRSCHHORN SYNDROME CANDIDATE 1;;
NUCLEAR SET DOMAIN-CONTAINING 2; NSD2;;
MULTIPLE MYELOMA SET DOMAIN; MMSET
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome (WHS; 194190) is a malformation syndrome
associated with a hemizygous deletion of the distal short arm of
chromosome 4 (4p16.3). The shortest region of overlap of the deletions
observed in WHS patients, the WHS critical region, has been confined to
a region of 165 kb (Wright et al., 1997). This region was sequenced
completely during the search for the Huntington disease gene (Baxendale
et al., 1993). Stec et al. (1998) described a novel developmental gene,
two-thirds of which maps in the distal part of the WHS critical region.
They designated the gene WHSC1 (Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome candidate-1).
The WHSC1 gene was identified initially through its high similarity to
the translation product of an expressed sequence tag, located in the
165-kb WHCR, with the SET domain (see 600960) of the Drosophila protein
ASH1 (607999). The SET domain is found in proteins that are involved in
embryonic development. The WHSC1 gene was found to be expressed
ubiquitously in early development and to undergo complex alternative
splicing and differential polyadenylation. It encodes a 136-kD protein
containing 4 domains present in other developmental proteins: a PWWP
domain, an HMG box, a SET domain also found in the Drosophila dysmorphy
gene ash-encoded protein, and a PHD-type zinc finger. It is expressed
preferentially in rapidly growing embryonic tissues, in a pattern
corresponding to affected organs in WHS patients. The nature of the
protein motifs, the expression pattern, and its mapping to the critical
region led Stec et al. (1998) to propose WHSC1 as a good candidate gene
to be responsible for many of the phenotypic features of WHS.

GENE FUNCTION

Nimura et al. (2009) showed that the H3K36me3-specific histone
methyltransferase Whsc1 functions in transcriptional regulation together
with developmental transcription factors whose defects overlap with the
human disease Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome (WHS). Nimura et al. (2009) found
that mouse Whsc1, 1 of 5 putative Set2 homologs, governed H3K36me3 along
euchromatin by associating with the cell type-specific transcription
factors Sall1 (602218), Sall4 (607343), and Nanog (607937) in embryonic
stem cells, and Nkx2-5 (600584) in embryonic hearts, regulating the
expression of their target genes. Whsc1-deficient mice showed growth
retardation and various WHS-like midline defects, including congenital
cardiovascular anomalies. The effects of Whsc1 haploinsufficiency were
increased in Nkx2-5 heterozygous mutant hearts, indicating their
functional link. Nimura et al. (2009) proposed that WHSC1 functions
together with developmental transcription factors to prevent the
inappropriate transcription that can lead to various pathophysiologies.

Pei et al. (2011) found that H4K20 methylation actually increases
locally upon the induction of double-strand breaks and that methylation
of H4K20 at double-strand breaks is mediated by the histone
methyltransferase MMSET in mammals. Downregulation of MMSET
significantly decreases H4K20 methylation at double-strand breaks and
the subsequent accumulation of 53BP1 (605230). Furthermore, Pei et al.
(2011) found that the recruitment of MMSET to double-strand breaks
requires the gamma-H2AX (601772)-MDC1 (607593) pathway; specifically,
the interaction between the MDC1 BRCT domain and phosphorylated ser102
of MMSET. Thus, Pei et al. (2011) proposed that a pathway involving
gamma-H2AX-MDC1-MMSET regulates the induction of H4K20 methylation on
histones around double-strand breaks, which, in turn, facilitates 53BP1
recruitment.

GENE STRUCTURE

The WHSC1 gene contains 25 exons (Stec et al., 1998).

MAPPING

Stec et al. (1998) mapped the WHSC1 gene to chromosome 4p16.3 based on
genomic sequence analysis.

CYTOGENETICS

Stec et al. (1998) noted that the t(4;14)(p16.3;q32.3) translocations
described in a significant fraction of multiple myelomas (Richelda et
al., 1997; Chesi et al., 1997) have breakpoints located less than 100 kb
centromeric of the FGFR3 gene (134934) on 4p16.3. They found that at
least 3 of the breakpoints merged the immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene
(IGHG1; 147100) on chromosome 14 with the WHSC1 gene. This fusion of
genes and their untimely expression in the myeloid lineage driven from
the 5-prime IgH enhancer may indicate that WHSC1-encoded proteins are
involved in the clinical heterogeneity of multiple myeloma.

603549	TITLE *603549 CDP-DIACYLGLYCEROL SYNTHASE 2; CDS2
;;PHOSPHATIDATE CYTIDYLYLTRANSFERASE 2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) plays a central role in
Drosophila phototransduction. A photoreceptor-specific form of the
enzyme CDP-diacylglycerol synthase (CDS; EC 2.7.7.41), which catalyzes
the formation of CDP-diacylglycerol from phosphatidic acid, is a key
regulator of the amount of PIP2 available for signaling. By screening
EST databases, Halford et al. (1998) identified a partial human cDNA
with sequence similarity to CDS1 (603548). The deduced partial
polypeptide, which they designated CDS2, is 69% identical to CDS1.

Volta et al. (1999) isolated additional cDNAs encoding mouse and human
CDS2. The predicted human CDS2 protein contains 445 amino acids with 9
transmembrane domains. The sequences of human CDS2 and Drosophila CDS
proteins are 65% identical. Northern blot analysis revealed that CDS2
was expressed as greater than 9.5-, 4.4-, and approximately 3-kb mRNAs
in all tissues tested. In situ hybridization to adult and embryonic
mouse tissue sections showed that Cds2 is highly expressed in the
differentiating neuroblasts of the neural retina and in the central
nervous system during embryonic development, although not in the adult
retina.

MAPPING

By analysis of a radiation hybrid mapping panel and by fluorescence in
situ hybridization, Halford et al. (1998) localized the CDS2 gene to
20p13. Using analysis of an interspecific backcross, Volta et al. (1999)
mapped the mouse Cds2 gene to chromosome 2, in a region showing homology
of synteny with human chromosome 20p13.

603377	TITLE *603377 SOLUTE CARRIER FAMILY 22 (ORGANIC CATION TRANSPORTER), MEMBER 5; SLC22A5
;;ORGANIC CATION TRANSPORTER 2; OCTN2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Wu et al. (1998) cloned a full-length cDNA for OCTN2 (SLC22A5), a member
of the organic cation transporter family, from a human placental
trophoblast cell line. The OCTN2 cDNA encodes a predicted 557-amino acid
protein.

Tamai et al. (1998) cloned OCTN2 from a human kidney cDNA library. The
deduced protein shares 75.8% similarity with OCTN1 (604190). Northern
blot analysis showed that OCTN2 is strongly expressed in kidney,
skeletal muscle, heart, and placenta. identified OCTN2 as a
physiologically important, high affinity sodium carnitine cotransporter
in humans.

GENE STRUCTURE

Wu et al. (1998) determined that the OCTN2 gene consists of 10 exons and
spans approximately 26 kb.

GENE FUNCTION

Functional expression studies of OCTN2 in HEK293 cells by Tamai et al.
(1998) indicated that OCTN2 is a physiologically important, high
affinity carnitine transporter that shows significant sodium ion
dependence.

Heintzman et al. (2007) determined the chromatin modification states in
high resolution along 30 Mb of the human genome and found that active
promoters are marked by trimethylation of lys4 of histone H3 (H3K4),
whereas enhancers were marked by monomethylation, but not
trimethylation, of H3K4. They developed computational algorithms using
these distinct chromatin signatures to identify new regulatory elements,
predicting over 200 promoters and 400 enhancers within the 30-Mb region.
This approach accurately predicted the location and function of
independently identified regulatory elements with high sensitivity and
specificity and uncovered a novel functional enhancer for the carnitine
transporter SLC22A5 (OCTN2). The results provided insight into the
connections between chromatin modifications and transcriptional
regulatory activity and provided a new tool for the functional
annotation of the human genome.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Primary Systemic Carnitine Deficiency

Based on the observation that OCTN2 has the ability to transport
carnitine in a sodium-dependent manner, Nezu et al. (1999) searched for
mutations in the gene encoding OCTN2, designated SLC22A5, both in the
mouse model ('jvs') of primary systemic carnitine deficiency and in the
human disorder (CDSP; 212140). In the mouse model, they found a
loss-of-function missense mutation, a substitution of a hydrophilic
amino acid (arg) for a hydrophobic residue (leu) in a membrane-spanning
region of the OCTN2 transporter. In 3 unrelated families with systemic
carnitine deficiency, they found that CDSP patients were carrying
mutations in the SLC22A5 gene (603377.0001-603377.0004).

Lamhonwah and Tein (1998) studied the expression of OCTN2 in cultured
fibroblasts and lymphoblasts from 2 unrelated patients in whom they had
previously documented a carnitine uptake defect (Tein et al., 1990). In
both patients, they found truncating mutations in the cDNA
(603377.0005-603377.0007).

Wang et al. (1999) identified mutations in the OCTN2 gene in 2 unrelated
patients with CDSP, 1 homozygous and the other a compound heterozygous
(603377.0008-603377.0009).

Wang et al. (2000) studied 4 European families with primary carnitine
deficiency and found homozygosity for novel missense mutations in 3
patients. The fourth patient was compound heterozygous for R169W
(603377.0014) and W351R (603377.0015). Further studies failed to
indicate a correlation between residual carnitine transport and severity
of the phenotype or age at presentation, which varies from early in life
with hypoketotic hypoglycemia to later in life with skeletal myopathy or
cardiomyopathy.

Wang et al. (2001) reported 4 novel mutations in the SLC22A5 gene
causing primary carnitine deficiency. Alleles introducing premature stop
codons reduced the levels of the mRNA.

Lamhonwah et al. (2002) performed mutation screening of the OCTN2 gene
in 11 individuals with CDSP by direct nucleotide sequencing of PCR
products of all 10 exons. Carnitine uptake in cultured skin fibroblasts
ranged from 1 to 20% of normal controls. Eleven mutations were
described. No correlation between residual uptake and severity of
clinical presentation was found, which suggested that the wide
phenotypic variability was likely related to exogenous stressors that
exacerbated carnitine deficiency.

Rahbeeni et al. (2002) reported 2 novel mutations in the OCTN2 gene from
2 Saudi patients with systemic carnitine deficiency.

Dobrowolski et al. (2005) validated the dye-binding/high-resolution
thermal denaturation method for the identification of mutations in the
SLC22A5 gene and expanded the mutational spectrum in primary carnitine
deficiency.

Di San Filippo et al. (2006) found by confocal microscopy that several
OCTN2 missense mutants matured normally to the plasma membrane. By
contrast, other mutations caused significant retention of the mutant
OCTN2 transporter in the cytoplasm. Failed maturation to the plasma
membrane is a common mechanism in disorders affecting membrane
transporters/ion channels, including cystic fibrosis. To correct this
defect, di San Filippo et al. (2006) tested whether drugs reducing the
efficiency of protein degradation in the endoplasmic reticulum
(phenylbutyrate, curcumin) or capable of binding the OCTN2 carnitine
transporter (verapamil, quinidine) could improve carnitine transport.
Prolonged incubation with phenylbutyrate, quinidine, and verapamil
partially stimulated carnitine transport, while curcumin was
ineffective. Thus, pharmacologic therapy can be effective in partially
restoring activity of mutant transporters.

El-Hattab et al. (2010) reported 5 families in which low free carnitine
levels in the infants' newborn screen led to the diagnosis of maternal
systemic primary carnitine deficiency. Affected mothers were compound
heterozygotes or homozygotes for missense mutations. All infants were
asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis, and 1 was found to have systemic
primary carnitine deficiency. Three mothers were asymptomatic, one had
decreased stamina during pregnancy, and the fifth had mild fatigability
and developed preeclampsia. El-Hattab et al. (2010) concluded that these
findings provided further evidence that systemic primary carnitine
deficiency presents with a broad clinical spectrum from a metabolic
decomposition in infancy to an asymptomatic adult.

- Inflammatory Bowel Disease 5

For discussion of an association between variation in the SLC22A5 gene
and inflammatory bowel disease-5, see 606348.

ANIMAL MODEL

Shekhawat et al. (2007) found that Octn2 +/- mice were viable and
fertile, but Octn2 -/- mice survived only 4 to 5 weeks without carnitine
supplementation. Octn2 -/- mice developed enlarged fatty liver,
steatosis of other organs, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In addition,
Octn2 -/- mice developed intestinal villous atrophy and intestinal
breakdown and inflammation with intense lymphocyte and macrophage
infiltration, leading to ulcer formation and gut perforation. Shekhawat
et al. (2007) observed increased apoptosis of Octn2 -/- gut epithelial
cells and upregulation of Hsf1 (140580) and several heat shock proteins
(e.g., HSPA1A; 140550), which regulate OCTN2 gene expression. Intestinal
and colonic epithelial cells in wildtype mice showed high expression and
activity of enzymes of the beta-oxidation pathway (e.g., ADADM; 607008).
Shekhawat et al. (2007) concluded that carnitine-dependent oxidation of
long-chain fatty acids in mitochondria is essential for normal gut
function.

In 2 affected sibs with systemic carnitine deficiency (212140) in a
Japanese family reported by Matsuishi et al. (1985), Nezu et al. (1999)
found homozygosity for a 113-bp deletion in the SLC22A5 gene that
encompassed the initiation codon in exon 1. The next available ATG in
the correct frame was at codon 177, translation initiation at which
would lead to loss of 2 transmembrane domains in the protein.

SLC22A5, 1-BP INS, 226C

In a patient with primary systemic carnitine deficiency (212140)
reported by Shoji et al. (1998), Nezu et al. (1999) found compound
heterozygosity for mutations in the SLC22A5 gene. One allele had a
frameshift caused by a single cytosine insertion just after the start
codon. The second allele had a single base substitution in codon 132
(the first codon of exon 2), which changed a tryptophan (TGG) to a stop
codon (TGA) (W132X).

.0003
CARNITINE DEFICIENCY, SYSTEMIC PRIMARY
SLC22A5, TRP132TER

See 603377.0002 and Nezu et al. (1999).

In a Chinese family with systemic primary carnitine deficiency (212140)
reported by Tang et al. (1998), Tang et al. (1999) described compound
heterozygosity for a truncating mutation (trp132 to ter) and a missense
mutation (pro478 to leu; 603377.0011) in the SLC22A5 gene. Expression of
mutant cDNAs revealed virtually no uptake activity for both mutations.
The proband was the second child in the family. He was admitted with
acute metabolic derangement at the age of 6 months, went into cardiac
arrest, and succumbed shortly after admission. Peri-mortem serum free
carnitine was very low with a normal free carnitine-to-acylcarnitine
ratio. The diagnosis was established by measurement of carnitine uptake
into fibroblasts, which was only 5% of normal. His elder sister had died
after similar presentation. Physiologic studies in the parents indicated
that both were heterozygotes for a defective carnitine transporter.

.0004
CARNITINE DEFICIENCY, SYSTEMIC PRIMARY
SLC22A5, IVS8AS, G-A, -1

In a 5-year-old boy with systemic carnitine deficiency (212140), Nezu et
al. (1999) found that the SLC22A5 gene carried an acceptor splice site
mutation, a G-to-A transition in the last nucleotide of intron 8. The
most likely consequence of this mutation, the joining of exon 8 with
exon 10, was predicted to result in the creation of a premature stop
codon after 2 residues. The patient had recurrent episodes of Reye
syndrome, including encephalopathy, hyperammonemia, elevated liver
enzymes, and liver steatosis, with hypoglycemia between ages 2 and 3
years. He had been taking carnitine orally without any recurrence of the
episodes.

.0005
CARNITINE DEFICIENCY, SYSTEMIC PRIMARY
SLC22A5, 1394-BP DEL

In 2 patients with carnitine uptake defect (212140) reported by Tein et
al. (1990), Lamhonwah and Tein (1998) found compound heterozygosity for
mutations in the SLC22A5 gene. Both patients showed a partial cDNA
deletion of nucleotides 255-1649, resulting in a predicted truncated
protein of 92 amino acids. In patient 1, the second mutant allele
carried a 19-bp insertion between nucleotides 874 and 875, resulting in
a frameshift and yielding a predicted truncated protein of 284 amino
acids; in patient 2, the second mutant allele had a deletion of
nucleotides 875-1046, resulting in a predicted truncated protein of 237
amino acids. Patient 1 was a male of Italian descent; patient 2 was a
female of Mexican descent with a family history of an affected brother
who had died of cardiomyopathy. Both children had early-onset myopathy,
cardiomyopathy, and failure to thrive with less than 5% of control
carnitine concentrations in muscle and had a dramatic improvement in
growth, strength, and cardiac function following institution of high
dose oral carnitine supplementation. Patient 1 had a striking decrease
in renal reabsorption of carnitine (52%; normal greater than 95%)
despite low serum carnitine concentrations. His muscle carnitine
concentration increased to only 13% of control after carnitine
supplementation; however, this was sufficient to result in a resolution
of the lipid storage and a restoration of motor power.

CARNITINE DEFICIENCY, SYSTEMIC PRIMARY
SLC22A5, ARG282TER

In a patient with primary carnitine deficiency (212140), Wang et al.
(1999) found homozygosity for a C-to-T transition in exon 5 of the
SLC22A5 gene, converting codon 282 from CGA (arg) to TGA (stop). Both
parents were heterozygous.

Vaz et al. (1999) found the arg282-to-ter mutation in homozygous state
in a patient with classic manifestations of systemic carnitine
deficiency. Reintroduction of wildtype OCTN2 cDNA into fibroblasts of
the patient by transient transfection restored the cellular carnitine
uptake, confirming that mutation in OCTN2 was the cause of the systemic
carnitine deficiency.

Burwinkel et al. (1999) identified the arg282-to-ter mutation in 2
German patients who had different haplotypes, suggesting that this
mutation may either be recurrent or an ancient founder mutation. They
also found that the arg282-to-ter mutation was associated with a
splicing abnormality at the intron 6/exon 7 junction. However, no
mutations were present in exon 6, intron 6, or exon 7, suggesting that
defective splicing of exon 7 on the arg282-to-ter allele was due to an
unconventional, long-distance mechanism.

.0009
CARNITINE DEFICIENCY, SYSTEMIC PRIMARY
SLC22A5, TYR401TER

In a patient with primary carnitine deficiency (212140), Wang et al.
(1999) found compound heterozygosity for a paternal allele containing a
1-bp (A) insertion in exon 7, converting codon 401 from TAT (tyr) to TAA
(stop), and a maternal allele containing a 1-bp (G) deletion in exon 8
(603377.0010), causing a frameshift starting at codon 435 (gly) and
resulting in a premature termination signal at codon 458.

CARNITINE DEFICIENCY, SYSTEMIC PRIMARY
SLC22A5, TYR211CYS

In 2 unrelated patients with classic systemic carnitine deficiency
(212140), Vaz et al. (1999) found homozygosity for the same missense
mutation, 632A-G, which changes the tyrosine at amino acid position 211
into a cysteine (Y211C). The first patient had been reported by
Rodrigues Pereira et al. (1988) and by Scholte et al. (1990). The second
patient was admitted to hospital at 7 months of age because of failure
to thrive. Physical examination showed dilated cardiomyopathy. Cardiac
decompensation had existed from the age of 5 months. Treatment with
digoxin and diuretics was started. At the age of 20 months, she
presented with lowered consciousness, respiratory insufficiency,
hypoglycemia, hyperammonemia, elevated transaminases, and low plasma
carnitine concentrations. With carnitine therapy, improvement of the
echocardiographic findings was noted by the age of 2 years. At the age
of 5.5 years, the echocardiograph was almost normal.

.0013
CARNITINE DEFICIENCY, SYSTEMIC PRIMARY
SLC22A5, ARG169GLN

On 1 of 4 chromosomes from 2 unrelated German patients with systemic
primary carnitine deficiency (212140), Burwinkel et al. (1999)
identified a G-to-A transition at nucleotide 506 of the SLC22A5 gene,
resulting in an arg169-to-gln substitution. The mutation involved an
arginine residue absolutely conserved in the entire transporter
superfamily to which SLC22A5 belongs. On the 3 other chromosomes, they
identified an arg282-to-ter mutation in exon 5 of the gene
(603377.0008).

.0014
CARNITINE DEFICIENCY, SYSTEMIC PRIMARY
SLC22A5, ARG169TRP

Wang et al. (2000) described compound heterozygosity for arg169 to trp
and trp351 to arg (603377.0015) in a patient with systemic primary
carnitine deficiency (212140). The patient had presented at 5 years of
age with acute metabolic decompensation. The parents were unrelated.
This C-to-T transition in exon 2 occurred in a CpG region; therefore, it
was not surprising that another patient had a different mutation (R169Q;
603377.0013) in the same residue.

.0016
CARNITINE DEFICIENCY, SYSTEMIC PRIMARY
SLC22A5, ARG399GLN

Wang et al. (2001) reported Iranian Jewish sibs homozygous for a G-to-A
transition at nucleotide 1196 in exon 7 of the SLC22A5 gene, resulting
in an arginine-to-glutamine substitution at codon 399 (R399Q). Both
parents were heterozygous for this mutation. The first sib presented at
2 years of age in coma during an episode of gastroenteritis, while her
older sister had weakness of the proximal limb girdle musculature
requiring physical therapy, and developmental delays involving language
skills, concentration, and attention span. Starting her on carnitine
resulted in marked improvement of muscle tone, general mood, alertness,
activity, and concentration span.

.0017
RECLASSIFIED - VARIANT OF UNKNOWN SIGNIFICANCE
SLC22A5, -207G-C

This variant, formerly titled INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE 5, ASSOCIATION
WITH, has been reclassified based on the findings of Martinez et al.
(2006) and Silverberg et al. (2007).

Peltekova et al. (2004) found a 2-allele haplotype enriched in
individuals with Crohn disease (IBD5; 606348) involving a SNP in SLC22A4
(1672C-T; 604190.0002) and G-to-C transversion in the SLC22A5 promoter
(-207G-C). The 2-allele risk haplotype was referred to as TC for the
nucleotides involved in Crohn disease risk. The TC haplotype was not
enriched in individuals with ulcerative colitis.

In a case-control study of 309 Spanish patients with Crohn disease and
408 controls, Martinez et al. (2006) found conflicting evidence for the
role of the SLC22A4 1672C-T and the SLC22A5 -207G-C polymorphisms.
Separate analysis for each variant showed no disease association,
whereas a combination of the 2 variants showed a mildly increased
disease risk. The authors suggested that certain haplotypes in defined
populations may confer susceptibility or protection to Crohn disease.

Silverberg et al. (2007) evaluated 1,879 affected offspring and parents
ascertained by a North American IBD Genetics Consortium for 6 IDB5 SNPs.
The findings rejected the previously reported -207G-C SNP as the
potential causative variant for Crohn disease susceptibility, although
it did not compromise the observation that this SNP may alter SLC22A5
expression.

.0018
CARNITINE DEFICIENCY, SYSTEMIC PRIMARY
SLC22A5, MET1ILE

Dobrowolski et al. (2005) demonstrated a 3G-T transversion in the
SLC22A5 gene, predicted to produce a met1-to-ile substitution (M1I), as
the cause of systemic primary carnitine deficiency (212140). The
causative role of this missense mutation was confirmed by expression in
Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells.

.0019
CARNITINE DEFICIENCY, SYSTEMIC PRIMARY
SLC22A5, ARG254TER

In 2 unrelated Chinese patients with systemic primary carnitine
deficiency (212140), one of whom had previously been described by
Marques (1998), Tang et al. (2002) identified homozygosity for a 981C-T
transition in exon 4 of the SLC22A5 gene, resulting in an arg254-to-ter
(R254X) substitution. The predicted protein has only 5 of the 12
transmembrane domains and is a loss-of-function mutant. Both patients
had presented with acute heart failure and dilated cardiomyopathy.

Yamak et al. (2007) identified homozygosity for the R254X mutation in
affected members of 2 Lebanese families segregating for primary systemic
carnitine deficiency. Their patients shared a common haplotype with the
2 Chinese patients reported by Tang et al. (2002).

Lamhonwah et al. (2004) identified homozygosity for the R254X mutation
in a Saudi Arabian girl with systemic carnitine deficiency. Laboratory
studies showed impaired fatty acid oxidation and decreased carnitine
uptake in skin fibroblasts (less than 1% of control values). Western
blot analysis showed absence of the protein. Lamhonwah et al. (2004)
stated that the substitution resulted from a 760C-T transition in exon
4.

.0020
CARNITINE DEFICIENCY, SYSTEMIC PRIMARY
SLC22A5, ARG399TRP

In an African American family in which an infant was identified as
having low carnitine in newborn screening, subsequent analysis showed
that the asymptomatic mother actually had systemic carnitine deficiency
(212140), with a free plasma carnitine level of 1 micromol/L and a total
plasma carnitine of 2 micromol/L. She was found to be compound
heterozygous for a C-to-T transversion at nucleotide 1195 of the SLC22A5
gene, resulting in an arg-to-trp substitution at codon 399 (R399W), and
a second missense mutation (A442I; 603377.0021).

.0021
CARNITINE DEFICIENCY, SYSTEMIC PRIMARY
SLC22A5, ALA442ILE

In an African American family in which an infant was identified as
having low carnitine in newborn screening, subsequent analysis showed
that the asymptomatic mother actually had systemic carnitine deficiency
(212140). She was found to be compound heterozygous for a GC-to-AT
substitution at nucleotides 1324/1325 of the SLC22A5 gene, resulting in
an ala-to-ile substitution at codon 442 (A442I), and another missense
mutation (R399W; 603377.0020).

.0022
CARNITINE DEFICIENCY, SYSTEMIC PRIMARY
SLC22A5, GLY15TRP

El-Hattab et al. (2010) identified low carnitine in an Indian infant by
newborn screening. Subsequent analysis revealed that his mother had
primary carnitine deficiency (212140) with a free plasma carnitine level
of 3 micromol/L and total plasma carnitine of 7 micromol/L. She was
completely asymptomatic at the age of 33 years. She was homozygous for a
G-to-T transversion at nucleotide 43 of the SLC22A5 gene, resulting in a
gly-to-trp substitution at codon 15 (G15W).

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS; 194050) is a multisystem developmental
disorder caused by the deletion of contiguous genes at chromosome
7q11.23. A common interval that includes as many as 17 genes is deleted
in most patients. Meng et al. (1998) constructed a physical map
encompassing the 1.5-Mb region that is commonly deleted in WBS. They
identified 3 genes within this region, including WBSCR14, which they
designated WS-bHLH. By EST database searching, sequencing, and screening
of a human fetal brain cDNA library, they isolated a partial WBSCR14
cDNA encoding a protein belonging to the basic helix-loop-helix
leucine-zipper family of transcription factors.

De Luis et al. (2000) fully characterized the WBSCR14 gene. They
identified 2 intragenic polymorphic dinucleotide repeats and used them
to verify hemizygosity in WBS patients. They found that the WBSCR14 cDNA
encodes an 852-amino acid protein which, in addition to the bHLH-ZIP
motif, has a bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS). Northern blot
analysis detected a 4.2-kb transcript predominantly in adult liver and
at late stages of fetal development. De Luis et al. (2000) also cloned
the mouse homolog. Given that other bHLH-ZIP proteins are dose sensitive
and based on the putative function of WBSCR14 as a transcription factor,
de Luis et al. (2000) suggested that hemizygosity at this locus may be
involved in some features of WBS.

Kawaguchi et al. (2002) cloned Chrebp from rat liver. The rat Chrebp
protein shares approximately 94% and 82% identity with mouse and human
WBSCR14, respectively.

GENE FUNCTION

Cairo et al. (2001) found that WBSCR14 was expressed in multiple
tissues, including regions of the brain and the intestinal tract.
WBSCR14 formed heterodimers with the bHLH-ZIP protein Mlx (602976) to
bind the DNA sequence CACGTG. Like Max (154950), Mlx has no intrinsic
transcriptional activity, but its association with Mad1 (602686), Mad4,
Mnt (603039), or WBSCR14 can repress E-box-dependent transcription.
Preliminary results suggested a possible role of WBSCR14 in growth
control. The authors hypothesized that the Max-like bHLH-ZIP protein,
Mlx, is a key element of a transcription factor network, and that
WBSCR14 may contribute to some aspects of the WBS pathology.

Kawaguchi et al. (2001) noted that rat Chrebp is essential for
activation of the liver pyruvate kinase gene (PKLR; 609712). They stated
that Chrebp is activated by high glucose and is inhibited by cAMP. By
mutation analysis of mouse Chrebp, Kawaguchi et al. (2001) demonstrated
that the N-terminal NLS and the C-terminal bHLH and leucine zipper
domains were essential for transcription of a reporter gene from the PKL
promoter in transfected rat hepatocytes. These 2 domains were targets
for regulation by cAMP and glucose. Kawaguchi et al. (2001) found that
cAMP-dependent protein kinase (see 601639) phosphorylated ser196 near
the NLS, which inactivated nuclear import of Chrebp, and thr666 near the
bHLH domain, which dissociated Chrebp from DNA and inactivated PKL
transcription. On the other hand, high glucose stimulated
dephosphorylation, leading to translocation of Chrebp from the cytosol
into the nucleus, where dephosphorylation led to DNA binding.

Kawaguchi et al. (2002) found that acetate and fatty acids inhibited the
glucose-induced transcription of PKL in Chrebp-transfected rat
hepatocytes. Inhibition was associated with a significant increase in
cytosolic AMP and activation of AMPK (see 602739). They determined that
AMPK phosphorylated Chrebp on ser568, resulting in loss of DNA binding.

Several endocrine phenotypes, in particular impaired glucose tolerance
and silent diabetes, have been described in Williams-Beuren syndrome. A
heterodimeric complex consisting of WBSCR14 and the MAX-like protein
(MLX; 602976), binds and activates, in a glucose-dependent manner,
carbohydrate response element (ChoRE) motifs in the promoter of
lipogenic enzymes. Merla et al. (2004) identified 5 novel
WBSCR14-interacting proteins, 4 14-3-3 isotypes (beta, 601289; gamma,
605356; zeta, 601288; and theta, 609009) and NIF3L1 (605778), which form
a single polypeptide complex in mammalian cells. WBSCR14 was exported
actively from the nucleus through a CRM1-dependent mechanism. This
translocation was contingent upon the ability to bind 14-3-3. The
authors proposed that through this mechanism, the 14-3-3 isotypes may
directly affect the WBSCR14:MLX complexes, which may activate the
transcription of lipogenic genes.

Herman et al. (2012) reported that adipose tissue GLUT4 (138190)
regulates the expression of CHREBP, a transcriptional regulator of
lipogenic and glycolytic genes. Furthermore, adipose CHREBP is a major
determinant of adipose tissue fatty acid synthesis and systemic insulin
sensitivity. Herman et al. (2012) found a new mechanism for glucose
regulation of CHREBP: glucose-mediated activation of the canonical
CHREBP isoform (CHREBP-alpha) induces expression of a novel, potent
isoform (CHREBP-beta) that is transcribed from an alternative promoter.
CHREBP-beta expression in human adipose tissue predicts insulin
sensitivity.

GENE STRUCTURE

De Luis et al. (2000) determined that the WBSCR14 gene contains 17 exons
and spans 33 kb.

MAPPING

Meng et al. (1998) mapped the WBSCR14 gene to the WBS deletion region on
chromosome 7q11.23. De Luis et al. (2000) mapped the mouse Wbscr14 gene
to chromosome 5 in a region of conserved synteny with human 7q11.23.

;;NFE2-RELATED TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR;;
NFE2-RELATED FACTOR 1; NRF1;;
TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR 11; TCF11
DESCRIPTION The promoters of eukaryotic protein-encoding genes contain short
cis-acting elements that are binding sites for sequence-specific
DNA-binding proteins involved in the regulation of gene transcription.
These DNA-binding transcription factors can be grouped into classes on
the basis of their structural motifs for recognition. One of the
simplest DNA-binding motifs, the basic leucine zipper (bZIP), has been
identified in many different transcriptional regulatory proteins in
diverse organisms. The bZIP motif is made up of 2 distinct but usually
adjacent subdomains, a DNA-binding or basic domain that interacts with
sequence-specific DNA and a dimerization or leucine zipper domain.

Chan et al. (1993) devised a complementation assay in yeast to clone
mammalian transcription activators and used it to identify a distinct
human bZIP transcription factor, NFE2L1, which they designated NRF1
(NFE2-related factor-1) because of its similarities to NFE2 (601490).
Chan et al. (1995) showed that the NFE2L1 gene encodes a 742-amino acid
protein with a different molecular weight than either the p45 subunit
(NFE2) or the Maf protein subunit (MafF, MafG (602020), or MafK
(600197)) of nuclear factor erythroid-2. Chan et al. (1993) found that
NFE2L1 activates transcription via NFE2-binding sites in yeast cells.
The ubiquitous expression pattern of NFE2L1 and the range of promoters
containing the NFE2-binding motif suggested that this gene may play a
role in the regulation of heme synthesis and ferritin genes.

Luna et al. (1994) cloned and characterized cDNA clones and a genomic
clone encoding the NFE2L1 protein, which they called TCF11. The
structure of the derived protein and other evidence identified TCF11 as
a member of the bZIP family of transcription factors. The predicted gene
product showed a high degree of similarity to p45 NF-E2 (NFE2), the
hematopoietic cell-specific 45-kD subunit of the human globin locus
control region-binding protein NF-E2. These 2 proteins showed regions of
remarkable homology to 2 invertebrate proteins, CNC and skn-1,
postulated to regulate embryonic development in Drosophila melanogaster
and Caenorhabditis elegans, respectively.

McKie et al. (1995) cloned the mouse homolog of NFE2L1. The deduced
amino acid sequence was shown to have 97% homology to the human protein.

Luna et al. (1994) localized the human NFE2L1 gene to 17q22 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Chan et al. (1995) localized
NFE2L1 to chromosome 17q21.3 by FISH. By in situ hybridization, McKie et
al. (1995) mapped the mouse Nfe2l1 gene to 11DE, but signals were also
detected at 7D1-7F1 and 2E4-2G. McKie and Scambler (1996) also mapped
the murine homolog to mouse chromosome 11, using haplotype analysis of
an interspecific backcross.

ANIMAL MODEL

To determine the function of Nrf1, Chan et al. (1998) disrupted the
mouse gene by homologous recombination. Heterozygous Nfr1 mutant mice
developed normally, were fertile, and showed no obvious abnormalities.
Mice homozygous for the Nrf1 mutation suffered from anemia as a result
of abnormal fetal liver erythropoiesis and died in utero at mid-late
gestation. The authors did not detect defects in globin gene expression.
Abnormal red cell production appeared to result from a defect in the
fetal liver microenvironment specific for erythroid cells. Chan et al.
(1998) suggested that target genes regulated by Nrf1 play an essential
role during fetal liver hematopoiesis.

In adult mice with conditional deletion of hepatic Nrf1, Xu et al.
(2005) observed hepatic cancer. Before cancer development, mutant livers
exhibited steatosis, apoptosis, necrosis, inflammation, and fibrosis.
Nrf1 -/- hepatocytes showed oxidative stress, and gene expression
analysis revealed decreased expression of antioxidant response
element-containing genes (e.g. Gstm3 138390) and upregulation of Cyp4a
genes (see 601310). Xu et al. (2005) concluded that NRF1 has a
protective function against oxidative stress and, potentially, a
function in lipid homeostasis in the liver.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing candidate genes in the ALS2 (205100) critical region,
followed by RT-PCR and 5-prime RACE of brain and lymphocyte total RNA,
Hadano et al. (2001) cloned ALS2CR3. The deduced 914-amino acid protein
has a calculated molecular mass of about 101.4 kD. ALS2CR3 contains a
coiled-coil domain that shares significant homology with the coiled-coil
region in huntingtin-associated protein-1 (HAP1; 600947). Northern blot
analysis revealed ubiquitous expression of 7.0- and 4.5-kb transcripts,
reflecting the use of 2 alternate polyadenylation signals; expression
was highest in heart.

Using a sequence from the beta-2 subunit of the GABA-A receptor (GABRB2;
600232) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a rat brain cDNA library,
Beck et al. (2002) cloned rat Als2cr3, which they called Grif1. Northern
blot analysis detected a major 6.2-kb transcript in all tissues tested
except testis, which expressed a truncated transcript of 2.9 kb; a minor
4.2-kb transcript was also detected. Western blot analysis revealed
tissue-specific expression of 3 Grif1 species with different molecular
masses in brain, heart, and skeletal muscle. Grif1 was expressed in
HEK293 cells as 3 proteins with apparent molecular masses of 98, 106,
and 115 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

Beck et al. (2002) found that transfected rat Grif1 colocalized with
GABA-A receptor subunits. Immobilized Grif1 specifically precipitated
the alpha-1 (GABRA1; 137160) and beta-2 subunits of the GABA-A receptor
from detergent extracts of adult rat brain.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hadano et al. (2001) determined that the ALS2CR3 (TRAK2) gene contains
16 exons and spans more than 43 kb. It is transcribed in the
telomere-to-centromere direction. The promoter for ALS2CR3 is close to,
or overlaps, the promoter for ALS2CR2 (607333), which is transcribed in
the opposite orientation.

MAPPING

Hadano et al. (2001) mapped the TRAK2 gene within the ALS2 critical
region on chromosome 2q33-q34.

;;K23
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Keratin-23 is a member of the type I keratin family (Zhang et al.,
2001).

CLONING

Sodium butyrate (NaBu) induces differentiation and apoptosis in human
pancreatic cancer cell lines. By a suppression subtractive
hybridization-based technique, Zhang et al. (2001) identified a novel
intermediate filament protein, designated KRT23, that is highly induced
upon NaBu treatment of pancreatic cancer cells. The KRT23 cDNA expresses
a 1.65-kb mRNA encoding a deduced 422-amino acid protein that shares 42
to 46% sequence identity with other type I keratins within the
alpha-helical rod domain. Trichostatin A, a potent and specific
inhibitor of histone deacetylase, similarly induced KRT23 mRNA
expression. Treatment with either actinomycin D or cycloheximide
efficiently blocked the induction of KRT23 mRNA by either sodium
butyrate or trichostatin A. The results suggested that KRT23 is a novel
member of the acidic keratin family that is induced in pancreatic cancer
cells undergoing differentiation by a mechanism involving histone
hyperacetylation. The authors also showed that expression of
cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 (CDKN1A; 116899) is necessary for
efficient induction of KRT23 mRNA bu histone deacetylase inhibitors.

ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 255, INCLUDED; ZNF255, INCLUDED;;
BONE MARROW ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 2, INCLUDED; BMZF2, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Zinc finger proteins (ZNFs) are DNA-binding transcriptionl regulators,
and ZNFs containing Kruppel-associated box (KRAB) domains typically
mediate transcriptional repression. The ZNF224 gene encodes 2 splice
variants, ZNF224 and ZNF255 (also known as BMZF2), that are
differentially expressed in adult and fetal tissues and encode proteins
with different subcellular localizations. ZNF224 contains a KRAB domain,
localizes to the nucleus, and functions as a transcriptional repressor
of the aldolase A (ALDOA; 103850) gene. ZNF255 lacks the KRAB domain and
localizes throughout the cell, including nucleus, cytosol, and
nucleolus. Both ZNF224 and ZNF255 interact physically and functionally
with specific isoforms of WT1 (607103) (Medugno et al., 2007; Florio et
al., 2010).

CLONING

Using PCR primers based on conserved sequences of Kruppel-like genes to
screen a bone marrow cDNA library, followed by database searching and
3-prime and 5-prime RACE, Han et al. (1999) isolated cDNAs encoding
several zinc finger proteins, including ZNF255. The deduced 623-amino
acid ZNF255 protein contains 18 tandemly repeated C-terminal zinc finger
motifs with interspersed conserved knuckle sequences, as well as an
N-terminal Kruppel-related novel box (KRNB), which is also found in
FDZF2 (ZNF230). RT-PCR analysis detected wide expression that was
highest in hemopoietic tissues and cell lines.

By affinity chromatography to isolate HeLa cell nuclear proteins that
interact with WT1, followed by peptide analysis and RT-PCR of HeLa cell
mRNA, Lee et al. (2002) obtained a cDNA encoding ZNF255, which they
called BMZF2. The deduced 622-amino acid protein has a calculated
molecular mass of 72 kD. Northern blot analysis detected expression only
in fetal tissues. Transcripts of about 5.0 and 4.0 were detected in
fetal brain, lung, liver, and kidney, and a transcript of about 3.4 kb
was also detected in fetal lung. Western blot analysis of cytosolic and
nuclear fractions obtained from transfected cells indicated that ZNF255
is expressed in the nucleus.

Medugno et al. (2003) identified ZNF224 as a 97-kD protein that
interacted with the ALDOA (103850) negative regulatory element (NRE). By
database analysis, they identified a ZNF224 cDNA. The deduced 707-amino
acid protein contains 19 tandemly repeated C2H2-type zinc finger motifs
separated by 7-amino acid linkers.

Medugno et al. (2007) determined that ZNF224 and ZNF255 are splice
variants of the same gene that differ at their 5-prime UTRs and 5-prime
coding regions. The longer ZNF224 protein contains an N-terminal KRAB
domain and 19 C-terminal zinc fingers. ZNF255 lacks the KRAB domain of
ZNF224, but it has the 19 zinc fingers. Semiquantitative PCR detected
variable ZNF224 expression in all adult and fetal tissues examined.
Expression of ZNF255 was more restricted in adult tissues and showed
generally lower expression in adult tissues compared with fetal tissues.
Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that ZNF224 was expressed
exclusively in the nucleus. In contrast, ZNF255 was expressed in both
nucleus and cytoplasm, and it was also distributed in the nucleolus in
20 to 30% of cells, where it colocalized with fibrillarin (FBL; 134795).

Florio et al. (2010) noted that mouse does not contain an ortholog of
the ZNF224 gene.

GENE FUNCTION

Han et al. (1999) showed that the KRNB box of ZNF255 has a slight but
significant transactivation activity in yeast cells, but not in
mammalian cells.

Lee et al. (2002) demonstrated that ZNF255 interacted with WT1 in vitro
and in vivo. Mutation analysis showed that zinc fingers 6 to 10 of
ZNF255 were required to interact with the zinc finger region of WT1.
ZNF255 inhibited transcriptional activation by WT1, and the presence of
a repressor domain within ZNF255 was confirmed in a reporter assay.

By gel shift assay, Medugno et al. (2003) confirmed that ZNF224 bound
the negative cis element NRE in the ALDOA gene. Progressive deletion of
ZNF224 C-terminal zinc fingers reduced the ALDOA NRE binding. Expression
of ZNF224 in COS cells inhibited reporter activity from a promoter
containing 2 ALDOA NRE core elements in a dose-dependent manner. Medugno
et al. (2003) concluded that ZNF224 negatively regulates ALDOA gene
expression during the cell cycle and differentiation.

Using chromatin immunoprecipitation and reporter gene assays with
transfected HEK293 cells, Medugno et al. (2007) showed that ZNF255 was
weaker than ZNF224 in binding the NRE in the ALDOA promoter region and
in repressing expression of an ALDOA reporter plasmid.

By coimmunoprecipitation analysis of human cell lines, Florio et al.
(2010) discovered that ZNF224 interacted specifically and exclusively
with the -KTS isoform of WT1, whereas ZNF255 interacted with both the
+KTS and -KTS isoforms of WT1. Using a reporter plasmid containing the
promoter region of a WT1 target gene, VDR (601769), Florio et al. (2010)
showed that cotransfection of ZNF224 caused a dose-dependent enhancement
of WT1(-KTS)-mediated VDR expression, while ZNF255 had no effect.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed that ZNF224 was recruited
with WT1 to the VDR promoter. Knockdown of ZNF224 reduced VDR mRNA and
protein. In contrast, ZNF255, but not ZNF224, colocalized with WT1(+KTS)
in the polysome fraction of HEK293 cells and copurified with poly(A)
ribonuclear particles.

GENE STRUCTURE

Medugno et al. (2007) determined that the ZNF224 gene contains 6 exons.
The first 3 exons are noncoding. The 5-prime UTR of the ZNF255
transcript corresponds to intron 5, and the coding region of ZNF255 is
completely contained within exon 6.

MAPPING

By analysis of somatic cell hybrids and by in situ hybridization,
Rousseau-Merck et al. (1993) demonstrated that the KOX22 (ZNF224) gene
and the KOX5 (ZNF45; 194554) genes mapped to 19q13.2-qter. Furthermore,
by pulsed field gel electrophoresis experiments they showed that the
pair of genes lie within a DNA segment less than 300 kb long.

Using FISH, Han et al. (1999) mapped the ZNF224 gene to chromosome
19q13, where the ZNF256 gene (606956) maps.

608127	TITLE *608127 PRE-B-CELL LEUKEMIA TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR 4; PBX4
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database analysis, RT-PCR, and 3-prime RACE, Wagner et al. (2001)
cloned human and mouse PBX4. The deduced human and mouse proteins
contain 374 and 378 amino acids, respectively. RT-PCR and Northern blot
analyses of mouse tissues showed almost exclusive expression in testis.
Pbx4 was expressed in mouse prepubertal testis at around postnatal day
14, when the first spermatocytes had reached the pachytene stage of the
meiotic prophase. In situ hybridization of adult mouse testis detected
expression in all tubules in a ring of cells several layers thick in a
region corresponding to meiotic spermatocytes. Immunostaining detected
Pbx4 within the XY bodies of pachytene spermatocytes. RT-PCR detected
PBX4 expression in most human tumor cell lines examined.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Wagner et al. (2001) mapped the PBX4 gene
to chromosome 19p12. Using FISH, they mapped the mouse Pbx4 gene to
chromosome 8C proximal, in a region that shows homology of synteny to
human chromosome 19p13-p12.

609158	TITLE *609158 NODAL MODULATOR 2; NOMO2
;;PM5, CENTROMERIC COPY
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing tryptic fragments of a protein that interacted with
nicalin (NCLN; 609156) in human embryonic kidney cells, followed by
database analysis, Haffner et al. (2004) identified NOMO2, which they
referred to as NOMO and PM5. The deduced protein is a type I
transmembrane protein. Northern blot analysis detected a 4.5-kb
transcript expressed at highest levels in pancreas and skeletal muscle.
Expression was somewhat lower in heart and was very low in all other
tissues examined. The expression pattern of NOMO2 was similar to that of
nicalin. Endogenous human embryonic kidney cell NOMO2 had an apparent
molecular mass of 130 kD by SDS-PAGE. NOMO2 was associated with a 500-
to 550-kD complex that also contained nicalin. NOMO2 and nicalin
cofractionated with endoplasmic reticulum membranes.

GENE FUNCTION

By coimmunoprecipitation of cotransfected cells, Haffner et al. (2004)
confirmed a direct interaction between NOMO2 and nicalin. Ectopic
expression of both proteins in zebrafish embryos caused cyclopia, a
phenotype that can arise from a defect in mesendoderm patterning
mediated by the Nodal (601265) signaling pathway. Accordingly,
downregulation of Nomo resulted in an increase in anterior axial
mesendoderm and the development of an enlarged hatching gland.
Inhibition of Nodal signaling by ectopic expression of Lefty (see
603037) could be rescued by reducing Nomo levels. Furthermore, Nodal-
and activin (see 147290)-induced signaling were inhibited by nicalin and
NOMO2 in a cell-based reporter assay.

Using affinity purification and coimmunoprecipitation experiments,
Dettmer et al. (2010) showed that NOMO and nicalin interacted with
TMEM147 (613585). Knockdown of each of these components by RNA
interference showed that they stabilized one another. Knockdown and
overexpression studies suggested that nicalin is the key regulator of
the complex and that it binds to NOMO prior to inclusion of TMEM147 in
the complex. Mutation analysis revealed that the transmembrane domain of
nicalin was required for interaction with TMEM147, but not NOMO.
Coprecipitation studies with zebrafish embryos revealed conservation of
the nicalin-NOMO-TMEM147 complex.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Loftus et al. (1999) mapped the PM5 gene (see
NOMO1; 609157) to a region of chromosome 16p13.1-p11.2 that shows a high
degree of gene duplication. Scott (2004) mapped 3 copies of the PM5
gene, including NOMO2, within this region. The NOMO2 gene maps
centromeric to the ABCC6 gene (603234) and telomeric to the XYLT1 gene
(608124).

;;SGC32445;;
CHROMOSOME 5 OPEN READING FRAME 19; C5ORF19
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Lai et al. (2001) identified C5ORF19, which they called SGC32445, within
a region of chromosome 5q frequently deleted in malignant myelomas. The
deduced 152-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of about
17 kD. Northern blot analysis detected a transcript of about 2.2 kb.
C5ORF19 expression was abundant in brain, heart, and skeletal muscle,
low in placenta, kidney, and pancreas, and absent in lung and liver.

Transport of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to the cell surface
membrane is critical for receptor-ligand recognition. However, mammalian
GPCR odorant receptors (ORs), when heterologously expressed in cells,
are poorly expressed on the cell surface. By screening for genes that
induced cell surface expression of ORs expressed in human embryonic
kidney cells, Saito et al. (2004) identified mouse and human REEP1
(609139). They searched databases for homologs of REEP1 and identified
several other REEP genes, including REEP2. In situ hybridization of
mouse olfactory epithelium revealed that, unlike Reep1, Reep2 was not
expressed in olfactory neurons.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lai et al. (2001) determined that the C5ORF19 gene contains 8 exons and
spans more than 7 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Lai et al. (2001) mapped the REEP2 gene to
chromosome 5q31.

602770	TITLE *602770 CHROMOBOX HOMOLOG 2, DROSOPHILA POLYCOMB CLASS; CBX2
;;M33, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

'Polycomb' genes in Drosophila maintain the repressed state of homeotic
and other developmentally regulated genes (Wedeen et al., 1986; Kuziora
and McGinnis, 1988) by mediating changes in higher-order chromatin
structure (Paro and Hogness, 1991). M33, a mouse homolog of polycomb,
was isolated by means of the structural similarity of its chromodomain
(Pearce et al., 1992). The fifth exon of M33 contains a region of
homology shared by Drosophila and Xenopus. In Drosophila, its deletion
results in the loss of polycomb function.

CLONING

Gecz et al. (1995) isolated genomic clones of the human M33 homolog,
which they designated CBX2.

MAPPING

By analysis of somatic cell hybrids and by fluorescence in situ
hybridization, Gecz et al. (1995) mapped the CBX2 gene to 17q25.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Biason-Lauber et al. (2009) identified 2 missense mutations in the CBX2
gene in a patient who was prenatally identified as having a 46,XY
karyotype and born with completely normal external and internal female
genitalia.

ANIMAL MODEL

Katoh-Fukui et al. (1998) disrupted the M33 gene in mice by inserting a
poly(A) targeting vector into its fifth exon. More than half of the
resultant homozygous mutant mice died before weaning, and survivors
showed male-to-female sex reversal. Formation of genital ridges was
retarded in both XX and XY homozygous mutant embryos. Gonadal growth
defects appeared near the time of expression of the
Y-chromosome-specific Sry gene (480000), suggesting that M33 deficiency
may cause sex reversal by interfering with steps upstream of Sry.
Katoh-Fukui et al. (1998) pointed out that point mutations in the human
SOX9 gene (608160) cause campomelic dysplasia (CMPD1; 114290) associated
with male sex reversal. Because M33 is located distal to Sox9 on mouse
chromosome 11 with a linkage of 5.3 cM, the possibility that Sox9 was
affected coincidentally during gene targeting in ES cells was
considered. However, this possibility was ruled out by other transgenic
experiments. Katoh-Fukui et al. (1998) suggested that these homozygous
M33-mutant mice represent the first case in which male-to-female gonadal
sex reversal results from a defect in a known recessive gene.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
46,XY SEX REVERSAL 5
CBX2, PRO98LEU

In a child whose prenatally determined karyotype was 46,XY but who was
born a phenotypically normal female (613080), Biason-Lauber et al.
(2009) identified on the paternal allele a C-to-T transition at
nucleotide 293 of the CBX2 gene resulting in a pro-to-leu substitution
at codon 98 (P98L). The maternal allele contained an arg443-to-pro
mutation (602770.0002).

.0002
46,XY SEX REVERSAL 5
CBX2, ARG443PRO

In a phenotypically normal female with 46,XY karyotype (613080),
Biason-Lauber et al. (2009) identified a G-to-C transversion at
nucleotide 1370 of the CBX2 gene that resulted in an arg-to-pro
substitution at codon 443 (R443P). Both this mutation, on the maternal
allele, and the mutation on the paternal allele (602770.0001) occurred
in exon 5. Neither mutation was identified in 160 unrelated individuals.

179837	TITLE *179837 REPLICATION PROTEIN A3, 14-KD; RPA3
;;RPA14;;
REPA3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Umbricht et al. (1993) cloned RPA3, which is the 14-kD subunit of human
RPA, from a HeLa cell cDNA library. The RPA3 gene has a 692-basepair
sequence with an open reading frame encoding a protein of 121 amino
acids. The deduced amino acid sequence showed only limited similarity to
the small subunit of yeast RPA. See also RPA1 (179835) and RPA2
(179836).

GENE FUNCTION

The function of the ATR (601215)-ATRIP (606605) protein kinase complex
is crucial for the cellular response to replication stress and DNA
damage. Zou and Elledge (2003) demonstrated that the RPA complex, which
associates with single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), is required for recruitment
of ATR to sites of DNA damage and for ATR-mediated CHK1 (603078)
activation in human cells. In vitro, RPA stimulates the binding of ATRIP
to single-stranded DNA. The binding of ATRIP to RPA-coated
single-stranded DNA enables the ATR-ATRIP complex to associate with DNA
and stimulates phosphorylation of the RAD17 (603139) protein that is
bound to DNA. Furthermore, Ddc2, the budding yeast homolog of ATRIP, is
specifically recruited to double-stranded DNA breaks in an RPA-dependent
manner. A checkpoint-deficient mutant of RPA, rfa1-t11, is defective for
recruiting Ddc2 to single-stranded DNA both in vivo and in vitro. Zou
and Elledge (2003) concluded that RPA-coated single-stranded DNA is the
critical structure at sites of DNA damage that recruits the ATR-ATRIP
complex and facilitates its recognition of substrates for
phosphorylation and the initiation of checkpoint signaling.

Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID; 605257) is a ssDNA deaminase
required for somatic hypermutation and class switch recombination of
immunoglobulin genes. Class switch recombination involves transcription
through switch regions, which generates ssDNA within R loops. Chaudhuri
et al. (2004) characterized the mechanism of AID targeting to in vitro
transcribed substrates harboring somatic hypermutation motifs. They
showed that the targeting activity of AID is due to RPA, a ssDNA-binding
heterochimeric protein involved in replication, recombination, and
repair. The 32-kD subunit of RPA interacts specifically with AID from
activated B cells in a manner that seems to be dependent on
posttranslational AID modification. Chaudhuri et al. (2004) concluded
that RPA is implicated as a novel factor involved in immunoglobulin
diversification, and proposed that B cell-specific AID-RPA complexes
preferentially bind to ssDNA of small transcription bubbles at somatic
hypermutation hotspots, leading to AID-mediated deamination and
RPA-mediated recruitment of DNA repair proteins.

MAPPING

Using PCR amplification of genomic DNA from rodent-human hybrid cell
lines, Umbricht et al. (1993) mapped the human REPA3 gene to chromosome
7. By Southern analysis and PCR amplification of somatic cell hybrids of
chromosome 7, as well as by fluorescence in situ hybridization, Umbricht
et al. (1994) mapped RPA3 to 7p22.

612959	TITLE *612959 EPITHELIAL SPLICING REGULATORY PROTEIN 1; ESRP1
;;RNA-BINDING MOTIF PROTEIN 35A; RBM35A
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ESPR1 is an epithelial cell-type-specific splicing regulator (Warzecha
et al., 2009).

CLONING

Using a cell-based cDNA expression screen with human embryonic kidney
293T cells, Warzecha et al. (2009) identified mouse Esrp1 and Esrp2
(612960) as regulators of FGFR2 (176943) splicing. By database analysis,
they identified human ESRP1, which encodes a deduced 681-amino acid
protein containing 3 central RNA recognition motifs (RRMs). Comparison
of ESRP orthologs in diverse species showed significant sequence
conservation within the RRM domains, particularly RRM1. In situ
hybridization of neonatal and adult mice revealed distinct
epithelial-specific expression of Esrp1 in diverse tissues and organs,
with highest expression in skin and gastrointestinal epithelia.

GENE FUNCTION

Cell type-specific expression of epithelial and mesenchymal isoforms of
FGFR2 is achieved through tight regulation of mutually exclusive exons
IIIb and IIIc, respectively. Warzecha et al. (2009) showed that
expression of epitope-tagged mouse Esrp1 or Esrp2 in 293T cells induced
a substantial switch of endogenous FGFR2 transcripts from the
mesenchymal form with exon IIIc to the epithelial form with exon IIIb.
Microarray analysis revealed that cell lines classified as epithelial
expressed higher levels of ESRP1 and/or ESRP2 than cell lines classified
as mesenchymal. Depletion of ESRP1 and ESRP2 in a human prostate
epithelial cell line via RNA interference (RNAi) caused a significant
switch from exon IIIb to exon IIIc splicing in the endogenous FGFR2
transcript. Rescue experiments with mouse cDNAs showed that FGFR2-IIIb
splicing was more dependent on ESRP1 than ESRP2. RNAi experiments
revealed that ESRP1 and ESRP2 also regulated splicing of CD44 (107269),
CTNND1 (601045), and ENAH (609061), transcripts that undergo changes in
splicing during the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.

MAPPING

Hartz (2009) mapped the ESRP1 gene to chromosome 8q22.1 based on an
alignment of the ESRP1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK00178) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

601908	TITLE *601908 G PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTOR 20; GPR20
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

O'Dowd et al. (1997) reported the discovery of 4 novel human putative G
protein-coupled receptor (GPR) genes. The GPR20 gene was isolated by
amplifying genomic DNA from oligonucleotides based on the opioid and
somatostatin-related receptor genes and subsequent screening of a
genomic library. By screening an EST database, they identified cDNA
sequences that partially encode 3 additional GPRs. These cDNA fragments
were used to screen a genomic library to isolate the full-length coding
region of the genes. This resulted in the isolation of genes GPR21
(601909), GPR22 (601910), and GPR23 (LPAR4; 300086). The 4 encoded
receptors share significant identity to each other and to other members
of the receptor family (see GPR1; 600239). Northern blot analysis
revealed expression of GPR20 and GPR22 in several human brain regions,
while GPR20 expression was detected also in liver.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, O'Dowd et al. (1997) mapped GPR20
to 8q24.2-q24.3, GPR21 to 9q33, GPR22 to 7q22-q31.1, and GPR23 to
Xq13-q21.1.

609463	TITLE *609463 MKL1/MYOCARDIN-LIKE 2; MKL2
;;MYOCARDIN-RELATED TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR B, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF; MRTFB
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching a genomic database for sequences similar to MKL1 (606078)
and myocardin (MYOCD; 606127), followed by PCR and 5-prime RACE of HeLa
cell RNA, Selvaraj and Prywes (2003) cloned MKL2. The 3-prime noncoding
region of the cDNA is more than 3 kb long and contains 4 polyadenylation
elements. The deduced 1,049-amino acid protein contains an N-terminal
MKL homology domain with 3 RPEL motifs, followed by a basic region, a
glutamine-rich region, a SAP domain, and a leucine zipper-like region.
MKL2 shares 44% amino acid identity with MKL1 and 36% identity with
myocardin. Northern blot analysis detected a 9.5-kb transcript in all
tissues examined except lung. Expression was highest in skeletal muscle.

GENE FUNCTION

Cen et al. (2003) found that RNA interference of MKL1 or MKL2 reduced
serum and RhoA (165390) activation in HeLa cells, and the combination of
MKL1 and MKL2 RNA interference completely abolished induction.

Selvaraj and Prywes (2003) found that MKL2 was a strong transactivator
of promoters containing serum response elements (SRE). Activation by
MKL2 had a threshold effect in that 0.5 microgram caused little
activation, whereas 2.0 microgram caused 40-fold activation. Gel
mobility shift assays indicated that MKL2 did not bind DNA by itself,
but formed a complex with SRF (600589). Mutation analysis indicated that
the N-terminal 71 amino acids of MKL2 repressed the interaction between
MKL2 and SRF. The leucine zipper-like domain of MKL2 promoted
interaction with itself and with MKL1, as well as contributed to
transactivation. The transcriptional activation domain of MKL2 was
mapped to the C terminus, and the region from amino acid 701 to the C
terminus showed higher transcriptional activity than the full-length
protein. A C-terminal deletion mutant lacking the transcriptional
activation domain behaved in a dominant-negative manner to block
expression of SRF target genes in a mouse myoblast cell line, and it
blocked differentiation of the myoblasts to myotubes.

GENE STRUCTURE

Selvaraj and Prywes (2003) determined that the MKL2 gene contains 17
exons and spans more than 126 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Selvaraj and Prywes (2003) mapped the MKL2
gene to chromosome 16p13.1.

ANIMAL MODEL

Li et al. (2005) found that Mrtfb-null mice died between embryonic day
17.5 and postnatal day 1 from cardiac outflow tract defects. Mrtfb was
expressed in the premigratory neural crest, in rhombomeres 3 and 5, and
in the neural crest-derived mesenchyme surrounding the aortic arch
arteries. Consistent with the pattern of expression, Mrtfb-null embryos
exhibited deformation of aortic arch arteries 3, 4, and 6 and severe
attenuation of smooth muscle cell differentiation in the arch arteries
and the aorticopulmonary septum, despite normal migration and initial
patterning of cardiac neural crest cells. The pathology could be rescued
by targeting Mrtfb expression to the neural crest. Li et al. (2005)
concluded that Mrtfb plays a critical role in regulating differentiation
of cardiac neural crest cells into smooth muscle and that neural
crest-derived smooth muscle differentiation is required for normal
cardiovascular morphogenesis. Oh et al. (2005) reported similar findings
in Mrtfb-null mice.

DESCRIPTION Griffith et al. (1997) used serum from a Sjogren syndrome (270150)
patient with scleroderma to isolate a cDNA strand encoding a Golgi
complex antigen from a HeLa cell cDNA library. The clone encoded a
predicted 767-amino acid protein with a pI of 5.09, a granin motif (see
113705), and coiled-coil domains. On Western blots of HeLa cell
extracts, the encoded protein migrated at 97 kD, and so Griffith et al.
(1997) named it 'golgin-97.' Antibodies to golgin-97 stained the Golgi
complex.

607362	TITLE *607362 RGM DOMAIN FAMILY, MEMBER A; RGMA
;;REPULSIVE GUIDANCE MOLECULE; RGM
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Monnier et al. (2002) cloned and characterized a chicken
membrane-associated glycoprotein, RGM, that is a repulsive guidance
molecule for retinal axons. Chick RGM contains a signal peptide, an RGD
site, a von Willebrand factor (VWF; 613160) domain, a hydrophobic
region, and a GPI (glycosylphosphatidylinositol) anchor. Its mRNA is
distributed in a gradient with increasing concentration from the
anterior to posterior pole of the embryonic tectum of chicken.
Recombinant RGM at low nanomolar concentration induced collapse of
temporal but not of nasal growth cones and guided temporal retinal axons
in vitro, demonstrating its repulsive and axon-specific guiding
activity.

Wiemann et al. (2001) isolated a cDNA corresponding to human RGM
(GenBank GENBANK AL136826).

GENE FUNCTION

Rajagopalan et al. (2004) presented evidence that neogenin (NEO1;
601907) functions as a receptor for Rgm. Like Rgm, neogenin was
expressed in a gradient across the embryonic chicken retina. The
avoidance of Rgm by chicken temporal retinal axons was blocked by
anti-neogenin antibody and the soluble neogenin ectodomain. Dorsal root
ganglion axons were unresponsive to Rgm, but were converted to a
responsive state by neogenin expression.

Matsunaga et al. (2004) found that neogenin overexpression and Rgm
downexpression in the developing embryonic chicken neural tube induced
apoptosis. The proapoptotic activity of neogenin in immortalized
neuronal cells and in the neural tube was associated with cleavage of
its cytoplasmic domain by caspases.

Muramatsu et al. (2011) found that mouse dendritic cells expressed Rgma
mRNA and protein and that mouse Cd4 (186940)-positive T cells expressed
neogenin. Human RGMA bound mouse Cd4-positive T cells in a
concentration-dependent manner and enhanced adhesion in a Rap1 (see
605061)-dependent manner. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated
increased expression of Rgma in mice with experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis (EAE) and in brains and spinal cords of deceased
patients with multiple sclerosis (MS; see 126200). Neogenin was also
expressed in mice with EAE and in human MS tissues, but its expression
levels did not differ from controls. Treatment of mice with an antibody
to Rgma attenuated clinical signs of EAE and diminished T-cell responses
and cytokine secretion. Treatment with an RGMA-specific antibody also
reduced proliferative and cytokine responses of T cells from MS
patients. Muramatsu et al. (2011) concluded that an RGMA-specific
antibody suppresses T-cell responses, and they suggested that RGMA is a
potential target for treating MS.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Wiemann et al. (2001) mapped the human RGM gene to
15q26.1.

601717	TITLE *601717 SYNTAXIN-BINDING PROTEIN 2; STXBP2
;;UNC18, C. ELEGANS, HOMOLOG OF, 2;;
UNC18B;;
MUNC18-2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Several mammalian homologs of the C. elegans gene Unc18 have been
identified, including STXBP2. These genes are conserved across species
from yeast to man and are believed to take part in membrane-fusion
processes. See STXBP1 (602926).

CLONING

Ziegler et al. (1996) identified STXBP2, which they called UNC18B, as
part of a random sequencing of genes from IL2-activated human
natural-killer (NK) cells. Sequence analysis of a full-length cDNA
revealed that it encodes a polypeptide of 593 amino acids, which is most
closely related to mouse Unc18b (95% identical) and less closely related
to Unc18a (64% identical) and Unc18c (48% identical). Ziegler et al.
(1996) found by Northern blot analysis that UNC18B is expressed
predominantly as a 2.4-kb message in placenta, lung, liver, kidney, and
pancreas, as well as in peripheral blood lymphocytes.

GENE STRUCTURE

Zur Stadt et al. (2009) noted that the STXBP2 gene contains 19 exons.

MAPPING

Ziegler et al. (1996) mapped the STXBP2 gene to human chromosome
19p13.3-p13.2 and to the proximal arm of mouse chromosome 8.

GENE FUNCTION

Zur Stadt et al. (2009) demonstrated colocalization of STXBP2 and STX11
(605014) in CD8+ T and NK cells by immunofluorescence analysis.
Stimulation with IL2 (147680) further enhanced colocalization in CD8+
and NK cells. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated shared binding
sites between STXBP2 and STX11.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 8 unrelated probands with familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis
(FHL) mapping to chromosome 19p (FHL5; 613101), from 2 Saudi Arabian and
6 Turkish consanguineous families, zur Stadt et al. (2009) sequenced the
candidate gene STXBP2 and identified homozygous mutations in STXBP2 in
all 8 patients (see, e.g., 601717.0001-601717.0003). Sequence analysis
in other patients from nonconsanguineous FHL families revealed
homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for mutations in STXBP2 in 4
additional patients from Germany and the Czech Republic (see, e.g.,
601717.0004-601717.0006), 2 of whom had been previously reported (Beutel
et al., 2009; Sparber-Sauer et al., 2009). Corresponding heterozygous
mutations were found in all available unaffected parents, and none of
the mutations were detected in 210 chromosomes from ethnically matched
controls. Zur Stadt et al. (2009) identified STX11, a mutation in which
causes FHL4 (603552), as an interaction partner of STXBP2, and
demonstrated that this interaction is eliminated by the missense
mutations identified in the FHL5 patients, leading to decreased
stability of both proteins. Activity of NK and cytotoxic T cells was
markedly reduced or absent in FHL5 patients.

In affected members of 6 consanguineous families with FHL mapping to
chromosome 19p13.3-p13.2, Cote et al. (2009) sequenced the STXBP2 gene
and identified homozygosity for the P477L mutation (601717.0001) in 3
Saudi Arabian families and for the IVS14 splice site mutation
(601717.0003) in 3 families of Turkish, Palestinian Arab, and Iranian
origin, respectively.

Cetica et al. (2010) analyzed the STXBP2 gene in 28 FHL families in
which mutations in known FHL genes had been excluded by sequence
analysis, and identified homozygosity for 4 different missense mutations
in the STXBP2 gene in 4 (14%) of the 28 families, originating from
Italy, England, Kuwait, and Pakistan, respectively (see, e.g.,
601717.0001 and 601717.0007).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HEMOPHAGOCYTIC LYMPHOHISTIOCYTOSIS, FAMILIAL 5
STXBP2, PRO477LEU

In 2 brothers and another proband from unrelated consanguineous Saudi
Arabian families, who had onset of familial hemophagocytic
lymphohistiocytosis (FHL5; 613101) before 1 year of age, zur Stadt et
al. (2009) identified homozygosity for a 1430C-T transition in exon 16
of the STXBP2 gene, resulting in a pro477-to-leu (P477L) substitution at
a conserved residue. Analysis of CD107 degranulation in the 2 brothers
revealed that activity of NK and cytotoxic T cells was markedly reduced
or absent, and immunoblot analysis of cell lysates showed reduced
amounts of STXBP2; markedly decreased levels of syntaxin-11 (STX11;
605014) were also observed in the sibs. Coimmunoprecipitation studies
showed that ability to bind STX11 was absent with the P477L mutant. One
of the brothers underwent mismatched unrelated donor hematopoietic stem
cell transplantation (HSCT) at 12 months of age and had no active
disease at most recent follow-up; the other brother, who had central
nervous system involvement, underwent matched unrelated donor HSCT at 3
months of age but later died of venoocclusive disease.

In affected members of 3 unrelated consanguineous Saudi Arabian families
with FHL5, Cote et al. (2009) identified homozygosity for the P477L
mutation in the STXBP2 gene. No STXBP2 protein was detected in
lymphoblasts from 2 affected female sibs of 1 family. The parents and
unaffected sibs were all heterozygous for the mutated STXBP2 allele,
which was not found in 80 French, 50 Turkish, or 80 Arabic or Iranian
controls. The 5 patients were all diagnosed between 1 and 3.5 months of
age, and 3 of the 5 patients had died between 4 and 16 months of age.

In a Kuwaiti girl who was diagnosed with FHL at 7 months of age and was
still alive at 3.5 years of age after undergoing matched sib donor HSCT,
Cetica et al. (2010) identified homozygosity for the P477L mutation in
the STXBP2 gene.

.0002
HEMOPHAGOCYTIC LYMPHOHISTIOCYTOSIS, FAMILIAL 5
STXBP2, 3-BP DEL, 693GAT

In 2 unrelated Turkish probands from consanguineous families, who had
onset of familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (FHL5; 613101) at
1.5 and 2 months of age, respectively, zur Stadt et al. (2009)
identified homozygosity for a 3-bp deletion (693delGAT) in exon 9 of the
STXBP2 gene, resulting in deletion of ile232 at a conserved residue.
Coimmunoprecipitation studies showed that ability to bind STX11 was
absent with the ile232 deletion. Both patients had central nervous
system involvement; one underwent matched sib donor hematopoietic stem
cell transplantation (HSCT) at 4.5 months of age and had no active
disease at approximately 8 years of follow-up, whereas the other patient
did not undergo HSCT and died.

.0003
HEMOPHAGOCYTIC LYMPHOHISTIOCYTOSIS, FAMILIAL 5
STXBP2, IVS14AS, G-C, -1

In 2 unrelated probands of Turkish and German origin, who had onset of
familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (FHL5; 613101) at 28 and 44
months, respectively, zur Stadt et al. (2009) identified homozygosity
for a G-to-C transversion at the splice acceptor site in intron 14 of
the STXBP2 gene (1247-1G-C). Analysis of RNA from the Turkish patient
revealed a deletion of exon 15, resulting in a frameshift and 126 new
codons, in about 95% of clones, as well as 2 minor in-frame and 4
frameshift products. Analysis of CD107 degranulation in this patient
revealed that activity of NK and cytotoxic T cells was markedly reduced
or absent. The German patient underwent matched unrelated donor
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) at 16 years of age but
later died. The Turkish patient, who did not undergo HSCT, had recurrent
reactivations that were responsive to steroids. In another 3 unrelated
FHL patients, all with onset of disease after 1 year of age, the splice
site mutation was found in compound heterozygosity with a missense
mutation (601717.0004) and 2 different 1-bp deletions (601717.0005 and
601717.0006), respectively.

In 3 probands with FHL5 from consanguineous families of Turkish,
Palestinian Arab, and Iranian origin, respectively, Cote et al. (2009)
identified homozygosity for the 1247-1G-C mutation in the STXBP2 gene.
Sequencing of RT-PCR products revealed that rather than leading to a
premature stop codon, the splice mutation resulted in exchange of the
first 17 amino acids of exon 15 for 19 new amino acids from the intronic
sequence, in-frame with the last 20 amino acids of wildtype exon 15. The
parents were all heterozygous for the mutated STXBP2 allele, which was
not found in 80 French, 50 Turkish, or 80 Arabic or Iranian controls.
Lymphoblasts from the Turkish and the Iranian patients showed markedly
decreased STXBP2 protein expression. In the Turkish patient, his
homozygous brother who remained asymptomatic at 2.6 years of age, and
the Iranian patient, cultured NK cells exhibited impaired cytotoxic
granule exocytosis; the defect was overcome by ectopic expression of
wildtype STXBP2. The 3 symptomatic probands were diagnosed between 8
years and 12.5 years of age. The Iranian patient died at 20 years of age
after HSCT and had a sister who died at age 22 months with a
retrospective diagnosis of FHL5.

.0004
HEMOPHAGOCYTIC LYMPHOHISTIOCYTOSIS, FAMILIAL 5
STXBP2, LEU209PRO

In a German patient with onset of familial hemophagocytic
lymphohistiocytosis (FHL5; 613101) at 28 months of age, who had central
nervous system involvement and had recurrent reactivations with
spontaneous remissions or response to steroids, zur Stadt et al. (2009)
identified compound heterozygosity for a splice site mutation
(601717.0003) and a 626T-C transition in exon 8 of the STXBP2 gene,
resulting in a leu209-to-pro (L209P) substitution. Analysis of CD107
degranulation in this patient revealed that activity of NK and cytotoxic
T cells was markedly reduced or absent.

.0005
HEMOPHAGOCYTIC LYMPHOHISTIOCYTOSIS, FAMILIAL 5
STXBP2, 1-BP DEL, 260T

In a German patient with onset of familial hemophagocytic
lymphohistiocytosis (FHL5; 613101) at 15 months of age, who underwent
matched unrelated donor hematopoietic stem cell transplantation at 7
years of age but later died, zur Stadt et al. (2009) identified compound
heterozygosity for a splice site mutation (601717.0003) and a 1-bp
deletion (260delT) in exon 5 of the STXBP2 gene, resulting in a
frameshift and premature termination of the protein.

.0006
HEMOPHAGOCYTIC LYMPHOHISTIOCYTOSIS, FAMILIAL 5
STXBP2, 1-BP DEL, 706G

In a Czech patient with onset of familial hemophagocytic
lymphohistiocytosis (FHL5; 613101) at 15 months of age, who underwent
mismatched unrelated donor hematopoietic stem cell transplantation at 28
months of age and had no active disease at last follow-up, zur Stadt et
al. (2009) identified compound heterozygosity for a splice site mutation
(601717.0003) and a 1-bp deletion (706delG) in exon 9 of the STXBP2
gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature termination of the
protein.

.0007
HEMOPHAGOCYTIC LYMPHOHISTIOCYTOSIS, FAMILIAL 5
STXBP2, GLY541SER

In a Caucasian girl from the United Kingdom with FHL, who was still
alive at 2.75 years of age after undergoing matched unrelated donor
HSCT, Cetica et al. (2010) identified homozygosity for a 1621G-A
transition in exon 18 of the STXBP2 gene, resulting in a gly541-to-ser
(G541S) substitution at a highly conserved residue. The mutation was not
found in 120 healthy Caucasian controls. Biochemical analysis revealed
that G541S mutant disrupts association of STXBP2 with STX11 (605014).
Granule release assay using the patient's lymphocytes showed minimal
release in NK cells and completely absent release in CD3(+)CD8 cells;
cytotoxic T-cell lymphocytes from the patient showed a reduced but not
absent cell-killing capacity.

614725	TITLE *614725 SERINE ACTIVE SITE-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1; SERAC1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SERAC1 functions in phosphatidylglycerol remodeling that is essential
for mitochondrial function and intracellular cholesterol trafficking
(Wortmann et al., 2012).

CLONING

Wortmann et al. (2012) reported that the deduced SERAC1 protein has an
N-terminal signal sequence and a C-terminal serine-lipase/esterase
domain containing the consensus lipase motif GxSxG. Quantitative PCR
analysis detected variable SERAC1 expression in all adult and fetal
tissues examined, with highest expression in fetal skeletal muscle,
followed by adult brain, fetal heart, and fetal kidney. Expression in
fetal brain was much lower than that in adult brain. SERAC1 was detected
in all specific adult brain regions examined, with highest expression in
occipital cortex, followed by frontal cortex, cerebellum, and
hippocampus. Western blot analysis of fractionated human fibroblasts and
immunohistochemical analysis showed SERAC1 localization in both
mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum in a pattern consistent with
enrichment in the mitochondria-associated membranes. Database analysis
identified SERAC1 orthologs in all eukaryotes examined, with highest
conservation in the lipase domain.

GENE FUNCTION

Wortmann et al. (2012) assayed control fibroblasts and fibroblasts from
patients with 3-methylglutaconic aciduria with deafness, encephalopathy,
and Leigh-like syndrome (MEGDEL; 614739) due to SERAC1 mutations and
transfected patient fibroblasts with wildtype SERAC1. The results showed
that SERAC1 functions in the transacylation-acylation reaction that
converts phosphatidylglycerol-34:1 to phosphatidylglycerol-36:1.

GENE STRUCTURE

Wortmann et al. (2012) determined that the SERAC1 gene contains 17 exons
and spans about 59 kb.

MAPPING

Hartz (2012) mapped the SERAC1 gene to chromosome 6q25.3 based on an
alignment of the SERAC1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK027823) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 15 individuals from 13 families with 3-methylglutaconic aciduria with
deafness, encephalopathy, and Leigh-like syndrome (MEGDEL; 614739),
Wortmann et al. (2012) identified 14 different homozygous or compound
heterozygous mutations in the SERAC1 gene (see, e.g.,
614725.0001-614725.0005). The first 2 mutations were identified by exome
sequencing and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. The patients had
psychomotor retardation, spasticity and/or dystonia, deafness, and brain
lesions on MRI. Laboratory studies showed increased serum lactate and
alanine, urinary 3-MGA, mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation defects,
abnormal mitochondria, an abnormal phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin
spectrum in fibroblasts, and abnormal accumulation of unesterified
cholesterol within cells.

SERAC1, ARG148TER

In 3 members of a consanguineous Turkish family with 3-methylglutaconic
aciduria with deafness, encephalopathy, and Leigh-like syndrome (MEGDEL;
614739), Wortmann et al. (2012) identified a homozygous 442C-T
transition in the SERAC1 gene, resulting in an arg148-to-ter (R148X)
substitution. The mutation was identified by exome sequencing and
confirmed by Sanger sequencing, and was not found in 369 controls. The
index patient had previously been reported as patient 3 by Wortmann et
al. (2006). Clinical features included psychomotor retardation,
recurrent infections in infancy, hypoglycemia, spasticity, dystonia,
sensorineural deafness, brain atrophy, and lesions on brain imaging.
Laboratory studies showed increased serum lactate and alanine, urinary
3-MGA, mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation defects, abnormal
mitochondria, an abnormal phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin spectrum
in fibroblasts, and abnormal accumulation of unesterified cholesterol

SERAC1, IVS13DS, G-C, +1

In 2 unrelated patients with MEGDEL (614739), Wortmann et al. (2012)
identified a homozygous G-to-C transversion in the donor splice site of
exon 13 of the SERAC1 gene (1403+1G-C), resulting in the skipping of
exon 13 and nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. One patient was born of
consanguineous Pakistani parents and the other of unrelated Indian
parents; haplotype analysis suggested a founder effect. The mutation was
not found in 369 controls. The patients had psychomotor retardation,
spasticity, dystonia, Leigh syndrome-like lesions on brain imaging, and
increased urinary 3-MGA. Only 1 had hearing loss.

Wortmann et al. (2012) identified a homozygous 4-bp deletion
(1167delTCAG) in a canonical splice site of the SERAC1 gene, resulting
in the skipping of exon 12 and nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. The
mutation was not found in 369 controls. The patient, who was originally
reported as patient 1 by Wortmann et al. (2006), had recurrent
infections, failure to thrive, mental retardation, spasticity and
extrapyramidal symptoms, deafness, hypoglycemia, increased serum
lactate, abnormal lesions on brain imaging, and oxidative
phosphorylation defects.

In a Turkish girl, born of consanguineous parents, with MEGDEL (614739),
Wortmann et al. (2012) identified a homozygous 3-bp deletion
(1435delCTT) in the SERAC1 gene, resulting in an in-frame deletion of an
amino acid in the highly conserved lipase domain. The patient was
originally reported as patient 4 by Wortmann et al. (2006). The mutation
was not found in 369 controls.

In a Dutch girl with MEGDEL (614739), Wortmann et al. (2012) identified
a homozygous 2-bp duplication (1627dupTC) in the SERAC1 gene, resulting
in a frameshift and premature termination (Val544LeufsTer43). The
patient was originally reported as patient 2 by Wortmann et al. (2006).
The mutation was not found in 369 controls.

614611	TITLE *614611 KN MOTIF- AND ANKYRIN REPEAT DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 3; KANK3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the KANK family, such as KANK3, contain a KANK N-terminal
(KN) motif, at least 1 coiled-coil domain, and an ankyrin (see 612641)
repeat domain. KANK proteins appear to regulate formation of actin
stress fibers (Zhu et al., 2008).

CLONING

By database analysis, Zhu et al. (2008) identified human KANK2 (614610),
KANK3, and KANK4 (614612). They identified orthologs of all 3 KANK genes
in rat and mouse and at least 1 KANK ortholog in chicken, fish, sea
urchin, fly, and nematode. The deduced 821-amino acid human KANK3
protein contains a KN motif, followed by 2 coiled-coil motifs and 5
C-terminal ankyrin repeats. The KN motif contains leucine- and
arginine-rich regions and potential nuclear localization and export
signals. RT-PCR detected KANK3 expression in all tissues examined, with
highest expression in breast, liver, lung, skeletal muscle, and kidney.

GENE FUNCTION

Zhu et al. (2008) found that overexpression of human KANK2, KANK3, or
KANK4 in mouse fibroblasts reduced formation of actin stress fibers.

MAPPING

Hartz (2012) mapped the KANK3 gene to chromosome 19p13.2 based on an
alignment of the KANK3 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK128815) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

116897	TITLE *116897 CCAAT/ENHANCER-BINDING PROTEIN, ALPHA; CEBPA
;;C/EBP-ALPHA;;
CEBP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein bears sequence homology and
functional similarities to liver activator protein (LAP, or CEBPB;
189965) (Descombes et al., 1990). See Landschulz et al. (1989).

Using rat Cebp-alpha to screen a human liver cDNA library, followed by
screening a human placenta genomic library, Swart et al. (1997) cloned
full-length CEBP-alpha. The deduced 357-amino acid protein has an
N-terminal transactivation domain and a C-terminal DNA-binding and
dimerization domain. Northern blot analysis detected high expression of
a 2.7-kb CEBP-alpha transcript in human placenta, liver, and spleen.
Lower expression was detected in colon, smooth muscle, lung, and kidney
medulla, and no expression was detected in kidney cortex. CEBP-alpha was
also expressed in normal and psoriatic human skin, in cultured human
keratinocytes, and in rat aorta and liver. Immunohistochemical analysis
detected CEBP-alpha in nuclei of epidermal keratinocytes from normal
human skin and lesional psoriatic skin. Intense staining was detected in
suprabasal cells, hair follicle keratinocytes, and glandular sebocytes,
but not in cells of the inflammatory infiltrate or capillaries.

GENE STRUCTURE

Swart et al. (1997) determined that the CEBPA gene is intronless.

MAPPING

By means of somatic cell hybrids segregating either human or rat
chromosomes, Szpirer et al. (1992) mapped the CEBP gene to human
chromosome 19 and rat chromosome 1. These results provided further
evidence for conservation of synteny on these chromosomes (and on mouse
chromosome 7). Using human/hamster somatic cell hybrids containing
restricted fragments of human chromosome 19, Hendricks-Taylor et al.
(1992) mapped the CEBPA gene to chromosome 19q13.1, between the GPI
(172400) and TGFB1 (190180) genes. This position was confirmed by
fluorescence in situ hybridization. Birkenmeier et al. (1989) mapped the
Cebpa gene to mouse chromosome 7.

GENE FUNCTION

Miller et al. (1996) characterized the promoter of the human gene
encoding leptin (164160), a signaling factor expressed in adipose tissue
with an important role in body weight homeostasis. They found that CEBPA
modulates leptin expression and suggested a function for CEBPA in
treatment of human obesity.

Wang et al. (2001) found that CEBPA directly interacts with CDK2
(116953) and CDK4 (123829) and arrests cell proliferation by inhibiting
these kinases. A region between amino acids 175 and 187 of CEBPA was
determined to be responsible for direct inhibition of cyclin-dependent
kinases and caused growth arrest in cultured cells. CEBPA inhibited CDK2
activity by blocking the association of CDK2 with cyclins. The
activities of Cdk4 and Cdk2 were increased in mouse Cebpa knockout
livers, leading to increased proliferation.

The myeloid transcription factor CEBPA is crucial for normal
granulopoiesis, and dominant-negative mutations of the CEBPA gene are
found in a significant proportion of patients with myeloblastic subtypes
(M1 and M2) of acute myeloid leukemia (AML; 601626). Pabst et al. (2001)
demonstrated that the AML1 (RUNX1; 151385)-ETO (CBFA2T1; 133435) fusion
protein suppressed CEBPA expression. Helbling et al. (2004) found that
the leukemic AML1-MDS1-EAI1 (AME; see 151385) fusion protein suppressed
CEBPA protein. In contrast to the AML1-ETO fusion, AME failed to
suppress CEBPA mRNA expression. Helbling et al. (2004) found that a
putative inhibitor of CEBPA translation, calreticulin (CRT; 109091), was
strongly activated after induction of AME in a cell line experimental
system (14.8-fold) and in AME patient samples (12.2-fold). Moreover,
inhibition of CRT by small interfering RNA restored CEBPA levels. These
results identified CEBPA as a key target of the leukemic fusion protein
AME and suggested that modulation of CEBPA by CRT may represent a
mechanism involved in the differentiation block in AME leukemias.

Menard et al. (2002) showed that Cebpa was expressed in mouse cortical
progenitor cells and could induce expression of a reporter gene
containing the minimal promoter of alpha-tubulin (TUBA1A; 602529), a
neuron-specific gene.

Skokowa et al. (2006) found significantly decreased or absent LEF1
(153245) expression in arrested promyelocytes from patients with
congenital neutropenia (see 202700). Competitive binding and chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays showed that LEF1 directly bound to and
regulated CEBPA, suggesting that LEF1-dependent downregulation of CEBPA
in congenital neutropenia leads to a maturation block in promyelocytes
similar to that seen in CEBPA dominant-negative AML.

By peptide analysis of nuclear proteins that interacted with CEBPA,
Bararia et al. (2008) identified TIP60 (KAT5; 601409) as a CEBPA binding
partner. The interaction was confirmed by coprecipitation analysis and
protein pull-down assays. TIP60 enhanced the ability of CEBPA to
transactivate a TK (TK1; 188300) promoter containing 2 CCAAT sites, and
the histone acetyltransferase activity of TIP60 was required for its
cooperativity with CEBPA. Domain analysis revealed that TIP60 interacted
with the DNA-binding and transactivation domains of CEBPA.
Immunoprecipitation analysis showed that TIP60 was recruited to the
promoters of CEBPA and GCSFR (CSF3R; 138971) following
beta-estradiol-induced differentiation of K562 myelogenous leukemia
cells, which was concomitant with histone acetylation at the CEBPA and
GCSFR promoters.

Reddy et al. (2009) showed that microRNA-661 (MIR661; 613716)
downregulated expression of MTA1 (603526), a gene that is upregulated in
several cancers. They identified putative CEBP-alpha-binding sites in
the promoter region of the MIR661 gene. Reporter gene assays showed that
CEBP-alpha upregulated MIR661 expression in transfected HeLa and MDA-231
breast cancer cells. Expression of CEBP-alpha and MIR661 was inversely
proportional to that of MTA1 in breast cancer cell lines, and the level
of MTA1 protein was progressively upregulated with increasing metastatic
potential. Overexpression of MIR661 in MDA-231 breast cancer cells
inhibited cell motility, invasiveness, and anchorage-independent growth,
and it reduced their ability to form tumors in a xenograft model. Reddy
et al. (2009) concluded that CEBP-alpha downregulates MTA1 expression
and cancer cell growth by upregulating expression of MIR661.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In the hematopoietic system, CEBPA is exclusively expressed in
myelomonocytic cells. It is specifically upregulated during granulocytic
differentiation. No mature granulocytes are observed in Cebpa-mutant
mice, whereas all the other blood cell types are present in normal
proportions. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML; 601626), the most prominent
abnormality is a block in differentiation of granulocytic blasts. With
this background information, Pabst et al. (2001) studied cases of AML
and demonstrated that CEBPA is mutated in 16% of AML-M2 patients that
lack the 8;21 translocation (ETO, 133435; RUNX1, 151385). They found
that 5 mutations in the N terminus truncate the full-length protein, but
did not affect the 30-kD protein initiated further downstream. The
mutated proteins blocked wildtype C/EBP-alpha DNA binding and
transactivation of granulocyte target genes in a dominant-negative
manner, and failed to induce the granulocytic differentiation. This was
the first report of CEBPA mutations in human neoplasia.

Pabst et al. (2001) detected 5 deletions, 2 insertions, and 4 point
mutations. All deletions caused a shift into the same alternative
reading frame, as the number of missing basepairs was (3n+1). The mean
age at diagnosis of the patients with CEBPA mutations was 66 years.
CEBPA mutations were found in 7.3% of AML patients.

Snaddon et al. (2003) stated that the t(8;21) translocation is found in
10 to 15% of cases of AML, particularly those of the M2 subtype, where
it accounts for 40% of cases. Using a PCR-SSCP and sequencing approach,
they screened for CEBPA mutations in 99 patients with AML type M1 or M2.
They identified 9 CEBPA mutations in 8 patients. All of the mutations
were clustered toward the C terminus of the protein. Two patients
carried biallelic mutations: one was homozygous for a 57-bp insertion at
nucleotide 1137 (116897.0004) and the other was compound heterozygous
for a 27-bp insertion at nucleotide 1096 (116897.0005) and a 4-bp
insertion (GGCC) at nucleotide 363 (116897.0006).

EVOLUTION

To explore the evolution of gene regulation, Schmidt et al. (2010) used
chromatin immunoprecipitation with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq)
to determine experimentally the genomewide occupancy of 2 transcription
factors, CEBPA and HNF4A (600281), in the livers of 5 vertebrates: Homo
sapiens, Mus musculus, Canis familiaris, Monodelphis domesticus
(short-tailed opossum), and Gallus gallus. Although each transcription
factor displayed highly conserved DNA binding preferences, most binding
was species-specific, and aligned binding events present in all 5
species were rare. Regions near genes with expression levels that are
dependent on a transcription factor were often bound by the
transcription factor in multiple species yet showed no enhanced DNA
sequence constraint. Binding divergence between species can be largely
explained by sequence changes to the bound motifs. Among the binding
events lost in one lineage, only half are recovered by another binding
event within 10 kb. Schmidt et al. (2010) concluded that their results
revealed large interspecies differences in transcriptional regulation
and provided insight into regulatory evolution.

NOMENCLATURE

According to the nomenclature proposed by Cao et al. (1991), the
CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein is C/EBP-alpha and NF-IL6 (LAP) is
C/EBP-beta, with the corresponding genes being CEBPA and CEBPB (189965).
CEBPB was formerly symbolized TCF5.

ANIMAL MODEL

Wang et al. (1995) found that mice homozygous for the targeted deletion
of the Cebpa gene did not store hepatic glycogen and died from
hypoglycemia within 8 hours after birth. In these mutant mice, the
amounts of glycogen synthase (138571) mRNA were 50 to 70% of normal and
the transcriptional induction of the genes for 2 gluconeogenic enzymes,
phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (261680) and glucose-6-phosphatase
(613742), was delayed. The hepatocytes and adipocytes of the mutant mice
failed to accumulate lipid, and the expression of the gene for
uncoupling protein (113730), the defining marker of brown adipose
tissue, was reduced. The findings demonstrated that C/EBP-alpha is
critical for the establishment and maintenance of energy homeostasis in
neonates.

Flodby et al. (1996) made transgenic knockout mice in which the CEBPA
gene was selectively disrupted. The homozygous mutant Cebpa -/- mice
died, usually within the first 20 hours after birth and had defects in
the control of hepatic growth and lung development. Histologic analysis
revealed that these animals had severely disturbed liver architecture,
with acinar formation, in a pattern suggestive of either regenerating
liver or hepatocellular carcinoma. Pulmonary histology showed
hyperproliferation of type II pneumocytes and disturbed alveolar
architecture. Molecular analysis showed that accumulation of glycogen
and lipids in the liver and adipose tissue is impaired and that the
mutant animals are severely hypoglycemic. The authors found by Northern
blot analysis that levels of c-myc and c-jun RNAs are specifically
induced by several fold in the livers of these animals indicating an
active proliferative state. They found by immunohistology that
cyclin-stained cells are present in the liver of Cebpa -/- mice at a 5
to 10 times higher frequency than normal, also indicating abnormally
active proliferation. Flodby et al. (1996) suggested that CEBPA may have
an important role in the acquisition and maintenance of terminal
differentiation in hepatocytes.

Mice deficient in Cebpa have defective development of adipose tissue. Wu
et al. (1999) used fibroblasts from Cebpa -/- mice in combination with
retroviral vectors expressing Cebpa and peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARG; 601487) to determine the
precise role of CEBPA in adipogenesis. The authors found that Cebpa -/-
fibroblasts underwent adipose differentiation through expression and
activation of Pparg. Cebpa-deficient adipocytes accumulated less lipid
and did not induce endogenous Pparg, indicating that cross-regulation
between CEBPA and PPARG is important in maintaining the differentiated
state. The cells also showed a complete absence of insulin (INS;
176730)-stimulated glucose transport, secondary to reduced gene
expression and tyrosine phosphorylation for the Ins receptor (147670)
and Ins receptor substrate-1 (147545). Wu et al. (1999) concluded that
CEBPA has multiple roles in adipogenesis and that cross-regulation
between PPARG and CEBPA is a key component of the transcriptional
control of this cell lineage.

164035	TITLE *164035 NUCLEOLIN; NCL
;;C23
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Nucleolin, also known as C23, is an abundantly expressed acidic
phosphoprotein of exponentially growing cells and is located mainly in
dense fibrillar regions of the nucleolus. It is involved in the control
of transcription of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes by RNA polymerase I, in
ribosome maturation and assembly, and in nucleocytoplasmic
transportation of ribosomal components (Srivastava et al., 1989).

CLONING

From a lambda-gt10 human retinal library using a bovine cDNA probe,
Srivastava et al. (1989) isolated a cDNA containing the entire coding
region of nucleolin. The cDNA hybridized to a transcript of 3,000 bases
from fast-dividing cells, as well as terminally differentiated tissues
of several species. Translation of the nucleotide sequence showed a long
open reading frame encoding a predicted a 707-amino acid protein with
several distinct domains.

GENE FUNCTION

Using in vitro pull-down assays, Ying et al. (2000) showed that A-Myb
(MYBL1; 159405) and c-Myb (MYB; 189990), but not B-Myb (MYBL2; 601415),
interacted with nucleolin. Coimmunoprecipitation assays confirmed the
interaction in a human lymphoma cell line. Cotransfection of nucleolin
with c-Myb and a reporter plasmid revealed that nucleolin inhibited the
transcriptional activity of c-Myb in a dose-dependent manner. Mutational
analysis indicated that the R2 and R3 repeats of c-Myb were sufficient
for nucleolin binding and that arg161, which is found only in c-Myb and
A-Myb but not in B-Myb, was critical for this interaction.

Using affinity chromatography with immobilized L-selectin (SELL;
153240), mass spectroscopy, and cell-surface labeling, Harms et al.
(2001) showed that nucleolin is partly exposed on the cell surface and
is a ligand of L-selectin in human leukocytes and hematopoietic
progenitor cells.

Using Northern blot and EMSA analyses, Grinstein et al. (2002) found
that nucleolin bound during S-phase in a sequence-specific manner to the
enhancer of HPV18, a human papillomavirus strain highly associated with
the development of cervical cancer. Treatment with nucleolin antisense
inhibited HPV18 oncogene transcription and blocked proliferation of
HPV18-positive cervical cancer cells. In contrast, nucleolin had no
effect on HPV16 oncogene transcription or proliferation of
HPV16-positive cervical cancer cells. Immunohistochemical analysis
showed that nucleolin expression shifted from a diffuse, homogeneous
nuclear pattern to a speckled nuclear distribution in HPV18-positive
precancerous and cancerous cervical uterine tissue. Grinstein et al.
(2002) concluded that nucleolin is directly linked to HPV18-induced
cervical carcinogenesis.

Early apoptotic human Jurkat T cells undergo capping of CD43 (SPN;
182160), and its polylactosaminyl saccharide chains serve as ligands for
phagocytosis by macrophages. Hirano et al. (2005) showed that nucleolin
is the polylactosaminoglycan-binding receptor on macrophages.
Nucleolin-transfected HEK293 cells expressed nucleolin on the cell
surface and bound early apoptotic cells but not
phosphatidylserine-exposing late apoptotic cells. The binding of early
apoptotic cells was inhibited by anti-nucleolin antibody, by
polylactosamine-containing oligosaccharides, and by anti-CD43 antibody.
Hirano et al. (2005) concluded that nucleolin is a macrophage receptor
for apoptotic cells.

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen and in vitro and in vivo binding assays,
including reciprocal immunoprecipitation assays, Tompkins et al. (2006)
showed that nucleolin bound the p19(ARF) isoform of CDKN2A (600160), but
not the p16(INK4A) isoform.

Using protein pull-down assays to identify proteins in 293T cells that
associated with acetylated interferon regulatory factor-2 (IRF2;
147576), Masumi et al. (2006) identified nucleolin. Nucleolin in the
presence of the transcription regulatory factor PCAF (602303) enhanced
IRF2-dependent H4 (see 602822) promoter activity in NIH3T3 mouse
fibroblasts. Nucleolin knockdown using small interfering RNA (siRNA)
reduced IRF2/PCAF-mediated promoter activity. Chromatin
immunoprecipitation analysis indicated that PCAF transfection increased
the interaction of nucleolin with IRF2 bound to the H4 promoter. Masumi
et al. (2006) concluded that nucleolin is recruited to acetylated IRF2,
thereby contributing to gene regulation crucial for cell growth control.

By immunoprecipitation analysis using membrane fractions of human
mammary epithelial cells, Shi et al. (2007) showed that endostatin
(120328), an inhibitor of angiogenesis and tumor growth, specifically
bound to cell surface nucleolin with high affinity. Blockage of
nucleolin with neutralizing antibody or knockdown of nucleolin by RNA
interference countered the antiendothelial activity of endostatin and
abrogated its antiangiogenic and antitumor activity in vivo. Nucleolin
and endostatin colocalized on the cell surface of endothelial cells in
tumors, and endostatin was internalized and transported into cell nuclei
of endothelial cells via nucleolin. In the nucleus, phosphorylation of
nucleolin, which is critical for cell proliferation, was inhibited by
endostatin. Shi et al. (2007) concluded that nucleolin is an endostatin
receptor that mediates the antiangiogenic and antitumor activities of
endostatin.

Padilla et al. (2008) found that BIG1 (ARFGEF1; 604141) coprecipitated
with nucleolin from nuclei of human hepatoma cells. Incubation of nuclei
with RNase A or DNase abolished the interaction, indicating that it
depended on nucleic acids, and Padilla et al. (2008) showed that U3
snoRNA (see 180710) was associated with BIG1 and nucleolin in nuclei.
The complex also contained fibrillarin (FBL; 134795), nucleoporin p62
(NUP62; 605815), and La (SSB; 109090). Fibrillarin was not present in
complexes containing BIG1 and nucleolin at the nuclear envelope,
suggesting that BIG1 and nucleolin participate in dynamic molecular
complexes that change composition while moving through nuclei.

Using antibody neutralization, competition, and RNA interference (RNAi)
assays, as well as expression of human nucleolin in nonpermissive insect
cells, Tayyari et al. (2011) demonstrated that respiratory syncytical
virus (RSV) interacted with host cell nucleolin via the viral fusion
envelope glycoprotein and bound specifically to nucleolin at the apical
cell surface. RNAi-mediated knockdown of lung nucleolin significantly
reduced RSV infection in mice. Tayyari et al. (2011) concluded that
nucleolin is a functional RSV receptor in vitro and in vivo.

GENE STRUCTURE

Srivastava et al. (1990) found that the gene consists of 14 exons with
13 introns and spans approximately 11 kb. Sequences in the 5-prime
flanking region and the first intron contain a high content of GC
residues consistent with nucleolin being a housekeeping gene. Introns 3
and 6 contain complete Alu repeats in reverse orientation relative to
the gene, and these are followed by 9-nucleotide poly(A) tracts. Intron
6 contains a partial Alu repeat and a partial KpnI repeat. Southern blot
analysis indicated that the gene is present in 1 copy in the haploid
genome.

Nicoloso et al. (1994) demonstrated that intron 11 of the NCL gene in
humans and rodents encodes a small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA), which they
designated U20 (604012). Sequence analysis revealed that U20 contains a
region of perfect complementarity with a conserved sequence in 18S rRNA,
suggesting that like nucleolin, it may be involved in the formation of
the small ribosomal subunit.

Rebane and Metspalu (1999) identified the snoRNA U82 (SNORD82; 611133)
in intron 5 of the human, rat, and mouse nucleolin genes. They stated
that intron 12 contains the snoRNA U23 (SNORA75).

MAPPING

By analysis of rodent/human somatic cell hybrids, Srivastava et al.
(1989) mapped the NCL gene to 2q12-qter.

600163	TITLE *600163 SODIUM CHANNEL, VOLTAGE-GATED, TYPE V, ALPHA SUBUNIT; SCN5A
;;NAV1.5
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Gellens et al. (1992) cloned and characterized the cardiac sodium
channel gene SCN5A. The deduced 2,016-amino acid protein has a structure
similar to that of previously characterized sodium channels (see 182392)
and contains 4 homologous domains, each of which has 6 putative
membrane-spanning regions.

GENE STRUCTURE

Wang et al. (1996) found that SCN5A consists of 28 exons spanning
approximately 80 kb. They described the sequences of all intron/exon
boundaries and a dinucleotide repeat polymorphism in intron 16.

MAPPING

George et al. (1995) mapped the SCN5A gene to chromosome 3p21 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization, thus making it an important
candidate gene for long QT syndrome-3 (LQT3; 603830).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Missense mutations in the skeletal muscle sodium channel gene, SCN4A
(603967), cause myotonia. Physiologic data show that these mutations
affect sodium channel inactivation and lead to repetitive
depolarizations, consistent with the myotonic phenotype. By analogy,
similar mutations in the cardiac sodium channel gene might be expected
to cause a phenotype like LQT. Indeed, Wang et al. (1995) found a
mutation in the SCN5A gene in families with chromosome 3-linked LQT (see
600163.0001).

Bennett et al. (1995) determined the functional defect resulting from
the 3-amino acid (KPQ) deletion (600163.0001) in the SCN5A protein. By
expression of recombinant human heart sodium channels in Xenopus laevis
oocytes, mutant channels showed a sustained inward current during
membrane depolarization. Single-channel recordings indicated that mutant
channels fluctuate between normal and noninactivating gating modes.
Persistent inward sodium current explains prolongation of cardiac action
potentials and provides a molecular mechanism for the chromosome
3-linked form of long QT syndrome.

Wang et al. (1995) identified SCN5A mutations in affected members of 4
additional families with chromosome 3-linked LQT. Two of the families
had the same 9-bp deletion found earlier; the other families were found
to have missense mutations affecting highly conserved amino acid
residues (600163.0002 and 600163.0003). The location and character of
the mutation suggested to the authors that this form of LQT results from
a delay in cardiac sodium channel fast inactivation or altered
voltage-dependence of inactivation.

Wang et al. (1996) determined the biophysical and functional
characteristics of each of the 3 distinct mutations that had been
identified in the cardiac sodium channel gene in patients with LQT3 to
that time. For this they used heterologous expression of a recombinant
human heart sodium channel in a mammalian cell line. Each mutation
caused a sustained, noninactivating sodium current amounting to a few
percent of the peak inward sodium current, observable during long (more
than 50 msec) depolarizations. The voltage dependence and rate of
inactivation were altered and the rate of recovery from inactivation was
changed compared with wildtype channels. These mutations in diverse
regions of the ion channel protein all produced a common defect in
channel gating that can cause the long QT phenotype. The sustained
inward current caused by these mutations would prolong the action
potential. Furthermore, they might create conditions that promote
arrhythmias due to prolonged depolarization and the altered recovery
from inactivation.

Wang et al. (1997) explored the potential for targeted suppression of
the defect in LQT3 by heterologous expression of mutant channels in
cultured human cells. Channel behavior and inhibition by mexiletine were
investigated by whole-cell patch-clamp methods. The investigators showed
that late-opening LQT3 mutant channels were much more sensitive to
inhibition by mexiletine than were wildtype sodium channels. The
defective late openings were selectively suppressed more than the peak
sodium current and these late openings could be suppressed by
concentrations at the lower end of the therapeutic range.

Using a candidate gene approach, Chen et al. (1998) studied 6 small
families and 2 sporadic patients with idiopathic ventricular
fibrillation (IVF; 603829) using SSCP and DNA sequence analyses to
identify mutations in known ion channel genes, including the cardiac
sodium channel gene SCN5A. They identified several mutations in families
with a distinct form of IVF known as Brugada syndrome (BRGDA1; 601144).
In 1 family all affected members had 2 mutations: an arg1232-to-trp
mutation in exon 21 of the gene in the extracellular loop between
transmembrane segments S1 and S2 of domain III of the protein, and a
thr1620-to-met mutation in exon 28 of the gene in the extracellular loop
between S3 and S4 of domain IV of the protein (600163.0004). Additional
SCN5A mutations were found in 2 IVF families: insertion of 2 nucleotides
(AA) in the splice-donor sequence of intron 7 (600163.0005); and
deletion of a single nucleotide (A) at codon 1397, resulting in an
in-frame stop codon (600163.0006). The frameshift mutation caused the
sodium channel to be nonfunctional.

Schott et al. (1999) reported a mutation in the SCN5A gene that
segregated with progressive familial heart block (PFHB1A; 113900) in an
autosomal dominant manner in a large French family. In a smaller Dutch
family, another SCN5A mutation cosegregated with familial nonprogressive
conduction defect (see 113900). The French family with PFHB1A was
identified through a member with right bundle branch block (RBBB) and
syncope; a brother had RBBB, and a sister had complete atrioventricular
(AV) block and syncope. Clinical and electrocardiographic abnormalities
were found in 15 members of the family; mean QRS duration was 135 +/- 7
ms. RBBB was present in 5, left bundle branch block (LBBB) in 2, left
anterior or posterior hemiblock in 3, and long PR interval (more than
210 ms) in 8. None had a structural heart disease. Four members of
earlier generations had received a pacemaker implantation because of
syncope or complete AV block. Long-term follow-up of several affected
members demonstrated that their conduction defect increased in severity
with age. In the Dutch family, the proband presented after birth with an
asymptomatic first-degree AV block associated with RBBB (PR interval and
QRS duration, 200 and 120 ms, respectively). In the French family,
Schott et al. (1999) excluded the chromosome 19 locus for this disorder
(604559) by linkage studies, as well as other loci for inherited cardiac
disorders associated with conduction defects. SCN5A was considered a
candidate locus, and using markers flanking SCN5A, the authors
demonstrated segregation of the disease with D3S1260 in every affected
individual (maximum lod score of 6.03 at theta of 0.0). A donor splice
site mutation in SCN5A was found in the French family (600163.0009), and
a frameshift mutation was identified in the Dutch family (600163.0010).
Clinical data and family histories indicated that none of the affected
individuals in these 2 families had LQT3 or idiopathic ventricular
fibrillation (Brugada syndrome). Therefore, PFHB1 represents a third
cardiac disease linked to SCN5A.

Splawski et al. (2000) screened 262 unrelated individuals with LQT
syndrome for mutations in the 5 defined genes (KCNQ1, 607542; KCNH2,
152427; SCN5A; KCNE1, 176261; and KCNE2, 603796) and identified
mutations in 177 individuals (68%). KCNQ1 and KCNH2 accounted for 87% of
mutations (42% and 45%, respectively), and SCN5A, KCNE1, and KCNE2 for
the remaining 13% (8%, 3%, and 2%, respectively).

Tan et al. (2002) demonstrated that calmodulin (114180) binds to the
carboxy terminal 'IQ' domain of the SCN5A in a calcium-dependent manner.
This binding interaction significantly enhances slow inactivation, a
channel-gating process linked to life-threatening idiopathic ventricular
arrhythmias. Mutations targeted to the IQ domain disrupted calmodulin
binding and eliminated calcium/calmodulin-dependent slow inactivation,
whereas the gating effects of calcium/calmodulin were restored by
intracellular application of a peptide modeled after the IQ domain. A
naturally occurring mutation (A1924T; 600163.0012) in the IQ domain
altered SCN5A function in a manner characteristic of the Brugada
syndrome, but at the same time inhibited slow inactivation induced by
calcium/calmodulin, yielding a clinically benign (arrhythmia-free)
phenotype.

Splawski et al. (2002) identified a common variant of the SCN5A gene,
ser1103 to tyr (S1103Y; 600163.0024), which is present in 13.2% of
African Americans and is associated with accelerated channel activation,
increasing the likelihood of abnormal cardiac repolarization and
arrhythmia. Splawski et al. (2002) suggested that the S1103Y mutation in
the African American population may be a useful molecular marker for the
prediction of arrhythmia susceptibility in the context of additional
acquired risk factors such as the use of certain medications or the
presence of hypokalemia.

Rivolta et al. (2001) identified 2 mutations at the same codon of the
SCN5A gene: a tyr1795-to-cys mutation (Y1795C; 600163.0029) in a patient
with LQT3, and a Y1795H (600163.0030) mutation in a patient with Brugada
syndrome. Functional analysis revealed marked and opposing effects on
channel gating consistent with activity associated with the cellular
basis of each clinical disorder: Y1795H accelerated and Y1795C slowed
the onset of activation; Y1795H, but not Y1795C, caused a marked
negative shift in the voltage dependence of inactivation; and neither
affected the kinetics of the recovery from inactivation. However, both
mutations increased the expression of sustained Na(+) channel activity
compared with wildtype channels, although this effect was most
pronounced for the Y1795C mutation, and both promoted entrance into an
intermediate or slowly developing inactivated state. Rivolta et al.
(2001) concluded that these data confirmed the key role of the
C-terminal tail of the cardiac Na(+) channel in the control of channel
gating and provided further evidence of the close interrelationship
between Brugada syndrome and LQT3 at the molecular level.

Clancy et al. (2002) performed detailed kinetic analyses of the Y1795C
mutant described by Rivolta et al. (2001). Theoretical entry and exit
rates from the bursting mode of gating were derived from single
channels. Computational analysis suggested that the amount of time
mutant channels spend bursting (burst mode dwell time) is primarily
responsible for rate-dependent changes in single-channel bursting and
macroscopic inward sodium channel (I-sus), hence delaying repolarization
and prolonging the QT interval. This prediction was experimentally
confirmed by analysis of delta-KPQ mutant channels (600163.0001) for
which the burst mode exit rate (determined by the burst mode dwell time)
was found to be very similar to the derived rate for Y1795C channels.
These results provided an explanation of the molecular mechanism for
bradycardia-induced QT prolongation in patients carrying LQT3 mutations.

Veldkamp et al. (2003) studied the effect of the 1795insD SCN5A mutation
(600163.0013), which causes LQT3 or Brugada syndrome, on sinoatrial (SA)
pacemaking. Activity of 1795insD channels during SA node pacemaking was
confirmed by action potential (AP) clamp experiments, and the previously
characterized persistent inward current (I-pst) and negative shift were
implemented into SA node (AP) models. The -10 mV shift decreased the
sinus rate by decreasing the diastolic depolarization rate, whereas the
I-pst decreased the sinus rate by AP prolongation, despite a concomitant
increase in the diastolic depolarization rate. In combination, a
moderate I-pst (1 to 2%) and the shift reduced the sinus rate by about
10%. Veldkamp et al. (2003) concluded that sodium channel mutations
displaying an I-pst or a negative shift in inactivation may account for
the bradycardia seen in LQT3 patients, whereas SA node pauses or arrest
may result from failure of SA node cells to repolarize under conditions
of extra net inward current.

Based on prior associations with disorders of cardiac rhythm and
conduction, Benson et al. (2003) screened the SCN5A gene as a candidate
gene in 10 pediatric patients from 7 families who were diagnosed with
autosomal recessive congenital sick sinus syndrome (SSS1; 608567) during
the first decade of life. Probands from 3 kindreds exhibited compound
heterozygosity for 6 distinct SCN5A alleles (e.g., 600163.0025), 2 of
which had previously been associated with dominant disorders of cardiac
excitability. Biophysical characterization of the mutants using
heterologously expressed recombinant human heart sodium channels
demonstrated loss of function or significant impairment in channel
gating that predicted reduced myocardial excitability. Thus Benson et
al. (2003) provided a molecular basis for some forms of congenital SSS
and defined a recessive disorder of a human heart voltage-gated sodium
channel.

In a patient with Brugada syndrome, Mohler et al. (2004) identified an
E1053K mutation (600163.0033) in the ankyrin-binding motif of Na(v)1.5.
The mutation abolished binding of Na(v)1.5 to ankyrin-G (ANK3; 600465),
and also prevented accumulation of Na(v)1.5 at cell surface sites in
ventricular cardiomyocytes. Both ankyrin-G and Na(v)1.5 localized at
intercalated disc and T-tubule membranes in cardiomyocytes, and Na(v)1.5
coimmunoprecipitated with the 190-kD ankyrin-G isoform from
detergent-soluble lysates from rat heart. These data suggested that
Na(v)1.5 associates with ankyrin-G and that ankyrin-G is required for
Na(v)1.5 localization at excitable membranes in cardiomyocytes.

Miller et al. (2004) reported a case of repeated germline transmission
of a severe form of LQT syndrome from an asymptomatic mother with
somatic mosaicism for a mutation in the SCN5A gene (600163.0007).

Maekawa et al. (2005) sequenced the SCN5A gene in 166 Japanese patients
with arrhythmia who were not diagnosed with LQT or Brugada syndrome and
in 232 healthy controls, identifying 69 genetic variations including 66
SNPs. The frequency of a 703+130G-A SNP was significantly higher in
patients than in controls (OR, 1.70), suggesting an association with an
unknown risk factor for arrhythmia. Haplotype analysis revealed that the
so-called GG haplotype with both the leu1988-to-arg and his558-to-arg
(600163.0031) SNPs was significantly less frequent in patients than in
controls (p = 0.018), suggesting a possible protective effect.

Tester et al. (2005) analyzed 5 LQTS-associated cardiac channel genes in
541 consecutive unrelated patients with LQT syndrome (average QTc, 482
ms). In 272 (50%) patients, they identified 211 different pathogenic
mutations, including 88 in KCNQ1, 89 in KCNH2, 32 in SCN5A, and 1 each
in KCNE1 and KCNE2. Mutations considered pathogenic were absent in more
than 1,400 reference alleles. Among the mutation-positive patients, 29
(11%) had 2 LQTS-causing mutations, of which 16 (8%) were in 2 different
LQTS genes (biallelic digenic). Tester et al. (2005) noted that patients
with multiple mutations were younger at diagnosis, but they did not
discern any genotype/phenotype correlations associated with location or
type of mutation.

In 44 unrelated patients with LQT syndrome, Millat et al. (2006) used
DHLP chromatography to analyze the KCNQ1, KCNH2, SCN5A, KCNE1, and KCNE2
genes for mutations and SNPs. Most of the patients (84%) showed a
complex molecular pattern, with an identified mutation associated with 1
or more SNPs located in several LQTS genes; 4 of the patients also had a
second mutation in a different LQTS gene (biallelic digenic inheritance;
see, e.g., 600163.0007 and 603796.0005).

In affected members of the family reported by Greenlee et al. (1986)
with a form of dilated cardiomyopathy (CMD1E; 601154), McNair et al.
(2004) identified heterozygosity for a missense mutation (D1765N;
600163.0001) in the SCN5A gene.

Groenewegen et al. (2003) found the same D1275N mutation, coinherited
with polymorphisms in the atrial-specific junction channel protein
connexin-40 (GJA5; 121013), in a family with atrial standstill. None of
the affected members in this family had dilated cardiomyopathy, leading
Groenewegen and Wilde (2005) to question the relationship of the SCN5A
mutation to dilated cardiomyopathy in the family reported by McNair et
al. (2004). McNair et al. (2005) responded that the younger age of the
affected members studied by Groenewegen et al. (2003) as well as
additional or genetic environmental factors may account for the
difference between the 2 families.

Olson et al. (2005) analyzed the SCN5A gene in 156 unrelated patients
with dilated cardiomyopathy who were negative for mutations in the known
CMD genes encoding cardiac actin (102540), alpha-tropomyosin (191010),
and metavinculin (see 193065), and identified 5 heterozygous mutations
in 5 probands, respectively (see, e.g., 600163.0037-600163.0039). All of
the mutations altered highly conserved residues in the transmembrane
domains of SCN5A.

Albert et al. (2008) analyzed 5 cardiac ion channel genes, SCN5A, KCNQ1,
KCNH2, KCNE1, and KCNE2, in 113 cases of sudden cardiac death. No
mutations or rare variants were identified in any of the 53 male
subjects, but in 6 (10%) of 60 female subjects, 5 rare missense variants
in SCN5A were identified, 2 previously associated with long QT syndrome,
1 with sudden infant death syndrome, and 2 not previously reported in
control populations. Functional studies showed that all of the variants
resulted in significantly shorter recovery times from inactivation.
Albert et al. (2008) concluded that functionally significant mutations
and rare variants in the SCN5A gene may contribute to the risk of sudden
cardiac death in women.

Makita et al. (2008) genotyped 66 members of 44 LQT3 families of
multiple ethnicities and identified the E1784K mutation (600163.0008) in
41 individuals from 15 (34%) of the kindreds; the diagnoses in these
individuals included LQT3 syndrome, Brugada syndrome, and/or sinus node
dysfunction (see 608567). In vitro functional characterization of E1784K
channels compared to properties reported for other LQT3 variants
suggested that a negative shift of steady-state Na channel inactivation
and enhanced tonic block in response to Na channel blockers confer an
additional Brugada syndrome/sinus node dysfunction phenotype, and
further indicated that class IC drugs should be avoided in patients with
Na channels displaying these behaviors.

In a large Finnish family with atrial fibrillation (AF) and conduction
defects (ATFB10; 614022), Laitinen-Forsblom et al. (2006) analyzed the
SCN5A gene and identified a heterozygous missense mutation (600163.0034)
that segregated with disease and was not found in more than 370 control
chromosomes.

Ellinor et al. (2008) analyzed the SCN5A gene in 57 probands with a
familial history of isolated or 'lone' atrial fibrillation and
identified heterozygosity for a missense mutation (600163.0041) in a
45-year-old male proband and his affected father. The authors concluded
that SCN5A gene was not a major cause of familial AF.

Darbar et al. (2008) analyzed the SCN5A gene in 375 probands with AF,
including 118 with lone AF, which was defined as AF occurring in
individuals less than 65 years of age who did not have hypertension,
overt structural heart disease, or thyroid dysfunction. The authors
identified 8 heterozygous variants in 10 probands that were not found in
360 age-, sex-, and ethnicity-matched controls (see, e.g.,
600163.0042-600163.0045). In addition, 11 previously reported rare
nonsynonymous coding region variants were identified in 12 probands
(see, e.g., 600163.0033), and 3 known common nonsynonymous SCN5A
polymorphisms were also identified in the AF cohort (see, e.g.,
600163.0024 and 600163.0031). Darbar et al. (2008) stated that in their
study, nearly 6% of AF probands carried heterozygous mutations or rare
variants in the SCN5A gene.

In affected members of 2 unrelated families with CMD and conduction
system disease, Hershberger et al. (2008) identified heterozygosity for
2 different missense mutations in the SCN5A gene, R222Q (600163.0046)
and I1835T (600163.0047), respectively. Cheng et al. (2010) restudied
the 2 families, noting that all affected individuals were also either
homozygous or heterozygous for the SCN5A common polymorphism, H558R
(600163.0031). Whole-cell voltage clamp studies in HEK293 cells using
the Q1077del background, which is the more abundant alternatively
spliced SCN5A transcript present in human hearts (65%), showed that
sodium current densities of the R222Q and I1835T mutants were not
different from wildtype, but the combined variants R222Q/H558R and
I1835T/H558R caused approximately 35% and 30% reduction, respectively,
and each showed slower recovery from inactivation than wildtype. With
the Q1077del background, R222Q and R222Q/H558R variants also exhibited a
significant negative shift in both activation and inactivation, whereas
I1835T/H558R showed a significant negative shift in inactivation that
tended to decrease window current. In contrast, expression in the Q1077
background showed no changes in peak sodium current densities, decay, or
recovery from inactivation for R222Q/H558R or I1835T/H558R. Cheng et al.
(2010) concluded that CMD-associated SCN5A rare variants perturb the
SCN5A biophysical phenotype that is modulated by SCN5A common variants.

In 3 unrelated families with multifocal ectopic Purkinje-related
premature contractions and dilated cardiomyopathy, Laurent et al. (2012)
identified heterozygosity for the R222Q mutation in the SCN5A gene,
which was fully penetrant and strictly segregated with the cardiac
phenotype in each family. Laurent et al. (2012) stated that the R222Q
effects that they observed on channel parameters were similar to those
measured by Cheng et al. (2010); in addition, they noted that the
effects were intermediate in the heterozygous state and also impaired
the window current, which is crucial during the plateau phase of the
action potential. In vitro studies recapitulated the normalization of
the ventricular action potentials in the presence of quinidine.

In affected members of a 3-generation Canadian family with CMD and
junctional escape ventricular capture bigeminy, Nair et al. (2012)
identified the R222Q mutation in the SCN5A gene. Heterologous expression
studies revealed a unique biophysical phenotype of R222Q channels in
which an approximately 10-mV leftward shift in the sodium current
steady-state activation curve occurs without corresponding shifts in
steady-state inactivation at cardiomyocyte resting membrane-potential
voltages. Nair et al. (2012) noted that the absence of H558R in these
patients established that the H558R polymorphism is not required for the
induction of cardiomyopathy in patients carrying the R222Q mutation.

In 16 affected members over 3 generations of a large kindred with CMD
and multiple arrhythmias, including premature ventricular complexes
(PVCs) of variable morphologies, Mann et al. (2012) identified
heterozygosity for the R222Q mutation in the SCN5A gene. The mutation
was also identified in 1 clinically unaffected family member, a
56-year-old man with a normal EKG and echocardiogram. None of the R222Q
carriers had the common SCN5A variant, H558R.

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

Westenskow et al. (2004) analyzed the KCNQ1, KCNH2, SCN5A, KCNE1, and
KCNE2 genes in 252 probands with long QT syndrome and identified 19 with
biallelic mutations in LQTS genes, of whom 18 were either compound
(monogenic) or double (digenic) heterozygotes and 1 was a homozygote.
They also identified 1 patient who had triallelic digenic mutations (see
152427.0021). Compared with probands who had 1 or no identified
mutation, probands with 2 mutations had longer QTc intervals (p less
than 0.001) and were 3.5-fold more likely to undergo cardiac arrest (p
less than 0.01). All 20 probands with 2 mutations had experienced
cardiac events. Westenskow et al. (2004) concluded that biallelic mono-
or digenic mutations (which the authors termed 'compound mutations')
cause a severe phenotype and are relatively common in long QT syndrome.
The authors noted that these findings support the concept of arrhythmia
risk as a multi-hit process and suggested that genotype can be used to
predict risk.

Niu et al. (2006) analyzed the SCN5A gene in 17 members of a
4-generation Han Chinese family with apparent autosomal dominant
inheritance of cardiac arrhythmias and sudden death. All affected
individuals were heterozygous for a nonsense mutation in the SCN5A gene
(W1421X; 600163.0036), and 1 unaffected individual was compound
heterozygous for the W1421X mutation and R1193Q (600163.0023). Niu et
al. (2006) suggested that the R1193Q mutation, which results in a gain
of sodium channel function, may compensate for the deleterious effects
of W1421X.

ANIMAL MODEL

Nuyens et al. (2001) reported that mice heterozygous for a knockin KPQ
deletion (600163.0001) of the Scn5a gene showed the essential features
of LQT3 and spontaneously developed life-threatening polymorphous
ventricular arrhythmias. Sudden accelerations in heart rate or premature
beats caused lengthening of the action potential with early
after-depolarization and triggered arrhythmias in mice heterozygous for
the deletion. Adrenergic agonists normalized the response to rate
acceleration in vitro and suppressed arrhythmias upon premature
stimulation in vivo. These results showed the possible risk of sudden
heart rate accelerations. The heterozygous knockin mouse with its
predisposition for pacing-induced arrhythmia might be a useful model for
the development of new treatments for the LQT3 syndrome.

Papadatos et al. (2002) showed that disruption of the mouse Scn5a gene
caused intrauterine lethality in homozygotes with severe defects in
ventricular morphogenesis, whereas heterozygotes showed normal survival.
Whole-cell patch-clamp analyses of isolated ventricular myocytes from
adult Scn5a +/- mice demonstrated a reduction of approximately 50% in
sodium conductance. Scn5a +/- hearts had several defects, including
impaired atrioventricular conduction, delayed intramyocardial
conduction, increased ventricular refractoriness, and ventricular
tachycardia with characteristics of reentrant excitation. These findings
reconciled reduced activity of the cardiac sodium channel leading to
slowed conduction with several apparently diverse clinical phenotypes,
providing a model for the detailed analysis of the pathophysiology of
arrhythmias. Noble (2002) commented that detailed understanding of the
mechanisms of cardiac arrhythmia at all relevant levels is important to
the design of therapeutic programs, and cited the work of Papadatos et
al. (2002) as an important step.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
LONG QT SYNDROME 3
SCN5A, 9-BP DEL, NT4661

In 2 apparently unrelated kindreds with chromosome 3-linked LQT syndrome
(603830), Wang et al. (1995) found deletion of 9 basepairs beginning at
nucleotide 4661 of their cDNA for SCN5A. The deletion, which was
detected by sequencing an aberrant SSCP conformer, resulted in deletion
of lys-pro-gln (KPQ), which are 3 conserved amino acids in the
cytoplasmic linker between domains III and IV of the channel protein.
The 3 amino acids involved in the in-frame deletion are lys1505,
pro1506, and gln1507. The effect of this mutation on membrane
depolarization was studied by Bennett et al. (1995).

Clancy and Rudy (1999) developed a model representative of the behavior
of the sodium channel in heart muscle cells using a single-channel-based
Markov model approach. They showed that the delta-KPQ mutant form of the
sodium channel stays open for too long, causing an overlarge inward
current of sodium which gives rise to arrhythmia. This model view was
corroborated by experiments recording actual sodium currents in cardiac
muscle cells.

.0002
LONG QT SYNDROME 3
SCN5A, ARG1644HIS

In a mother and son with the long QT syndrome (603830), Wang et al.
(1995) demonstrated a CGC-to-CAC mutation in codon 1644, resulting in
the substitution of a highly conserved arginine residue by histidine.

.0003
LONG QT SYNDROME 3
SCN5A, ASN1325SER

In a family in which members of 4 generations had been affected by the
long QT syndrome (603830), Wang et al. (1995) found an AAT-to-AGT
transition in codon 1325, predicted to cause substitution of a highly
conserved asparagine residue by a serine residue.

.0004
BRUGADA SYNDROME 1
SCN5A, ARG1232TRP AND THR1620MET

In affected members of a family with Brugada syndrome (601144), a
distinct form of idiopathic ventricular fibrillation, Chen et al. (1998)
found an arg1232-to-trp (R1232W) and a thr1620-to-met (T1620M) mutation
on the same chromosome with no mutation in the other chromosome,
suggesting to them that IVF in this family was inherited as an autosomal
dominant trait. The presence of both normal and mutated sodium channels
in the same tissue would promote heterogeneity of the refractory period,
a well established mechanism in arrhythmogenesis, and therefore may be
the underlying molecular defect that causes re-entrant arrhythmia in
this family. The potential contribution of R1232W and T1620M mutations
to the mechanism of IVF was determined by heterologous expression in
Xenopus oocytes. They found that sodium channels with the missense
mutation recovered from inactivation more rapidly than normal,
indicating that IVF with right bundle branch block (RBBB) and ST-segment
elevation is a defect distinct from long QT syndrome. When studied
alone, the R1232W mutant behaved most like normal channels, whereas the
T1620M mutant closely followed the kinetic pattern of the double mutant.
This indicated that T1620M is the mutation probably responsible for the
IVF phenotype in this kindred and that R1232W could be a rare
polymorphism. In summary, biophysical analysis of the 2 missense
mutations in SCN5A showed a shift in the voltage dependence of
steady-state inactivation toward more positive potentials associated
with a 25 to 30% acceleration in recovery time from inactivation at
potentials near -80mV.

Commenting that studies of the thr1620-to-met mutant by Chen et al.
(1998) revealed an abnormal electrophysiologic profile at room
temperature that did not adequately explain the ECG signature of Brugada
syndrome, Dumaine et al. (1999) undertook a more detailed
electrophysiologic study of the thr1620-to-met mutant protein. Dumaine
et al. (1999) expressed the mutant protein in a mammalian cell line and
employed a patch-clamp technique to study current kinetics at 32 degrees
C. The results indicated that current decay kinetics were faster in
mutant than in wildtype channels at this temperature and that recovery
from inactivation was slower, with a significant shift in steady-state
activation. These findings provided an explanation for the ECG features
of Brugada syndrome and represented the first illustration of a cardiac
sodium channel mutation in which arrhythmogenicity is revealed only at
temperatures approaching the physiologic range.

Voltage-gated sodium channels are multimeric structures consisting of a
large, heavily glycosylated alpha subunit and 1 or 2 smaller beta
subunits. The beta subunits are thought necessary for normal gating
function. In brain and skeletal muscle, the beta-1 subunit (600235)
accelerates sodium channel inactivation. Makita et al. (2000)
characterized the functional roles of the auxiliary beta subunit by
coexpression of the beta subunit with either wildtype SCN5A or SCN5A
carrying the heterologously expressed T1620M mutation in Xenopus
oocytes. The midpoint of steady-state inactivation was significantly
shifted to positive potentials in the T1620M alpha/beta-1 channel, with
an acceleration in recovery from inactivation when compared to other
channels. Makita et al. (2000) therefore suggested that coexpression of
T1620M alpha/beta-1 subunits exposed a significant electrophysiologic
deficit that may predispose to ventricular fibrillation. Expression of
both normal and mutant channels, as in the hearts of patients with
Brugada syndrome, would promote heterogeneity of the refractory period
in their myocardium, which serves as an ideal electrical substrate for
reentrant arrhythmia.

.0005
BRUGADA SYNDROME 1
SCN5A, IVS7DS, 2-BP INS

In affected members of a family with idiopathic ventricular fibrillation
with right bundle branch block (RBBB) and elevated ST segments, a
disorder known as Brugada syndrome (601144), Chen et al. (1998) found an
insertion of 2 nucleotides, AA, after the first 4 nucleotides (gtaa) in
the splice donor sequence of intron 7 of the SCN5A gene. The functional
consequences of this splicing mutation were not established.

.0006
BRUGADA SYNDROME 1
SCN5A, 1-BP DEL, VAL1398TER

In affected members of a family with idiopathic ventricular fibrillation
characterized by RBBB and elevated ST segments, a disorder known as
Brugada syndrome (601144), Chen et al. (1998) found a deletion of a
single nucleotide (A) from codon 1397 of the SCN5A gene. This deletion
resulted in an in-frame stop at codon 1398 (normally val). The resulting
truncation eliminated DIII/S6, DIV/S1-S6, and the C-terminal portion of
the cardiac sodium channel.

.0007
LONG QT SYNDROME 3
LONG QT SYNDROME 3/6, DIGENIC, INCLUDED
SCN5A, ARG1623GLN

In an infant Japanese girl with a severe form of LQT3 (603830), Makita
et al. (1998) identified a de novo missense mutation, arg1623 to gln
(R1623Q), in the S4 segment of domain 4 of the SCN5A gene. When
expressed in oocytes, mutant sodium channels exhibited only minor
abnormalities in channel activation, but in contrast to 3 previously
characterized LQT3 mutations, had significantly delayed macroscopic
inactivation. Single channel analysis revealed that R1623Q channels had
significantly prolonged open times with bursting behavior, suggesting a
novel mechanism of pathophysiology in Na(+) channel-linked long QT
syndrome.

Kambouris et al. (2000) reported that the R1623Q mutation imparts
unusual lidocaine sensitivity to the sodium channel that is attributable
to its altered functional behavior. Studies of lidocaine on individual
R1623Q single-channel openings indicated that the open-time distribution
was not changed, indicating the drug does not block the open pore as
proposed previously. Rather, the mutant channels have a propensity to
inactivate without ever opening ('closed-state inactivation'), and
lidocaine augments this gating behavior. An allosteric gating model
incorporating closed-state inactivation recapitulated the effects of
lidocaine on the pathologic sodium current. These findings explained the
unusual drug sensitivity of R1623Q and provided a general and
unanticipated mechanism for understanding how sodium channel-blocking
agents may suppress the pathologic, sustained sodium current induced by
LQT3 mutations.

In a male infant diagnosed with ventricular arrhythmias and cardiac
decompensation in utero at 28 weeks' gestation and with long QT syndrome
(603830) at birth, Miller et al. (2004) identified heterozygosity for
the R1623Q mutation. The mother had no ECG abnormalities, but a previous
and a subsequent pregnancy both ended in stillbirth at 7 months. Initial
studies detected no genetic abnormality, but a sensitive restriction
enzyme-based assay revealed a small percentage (8 to 10%) of cells
harboring the mutation in the mother's blood, skin, and buccal mucosa;
R1623Q was also identified in cord blood from the third fetus. Miller et
al. (2004) concluded that recurrent late-term fetal loss or sudden
infant death can result from unsuspected parental mosaicism for
LQT-associated mutations.

In a 1-month-old male infant who had syncope, torsade de pointes,
cardiac arrest, and a QTc of 460 ms, Millat et al. (2006) identified
biallelic digenic mutations: a 4868G-A transition in exon 28 of the
SCN5A gene resulting in the R1623Q substitution; and a missense mutation
in the KCNE2 gene (F60L; 603796.0005).

SCN5A, GLU1784LYS

Wei et al. (1999) described a family in which the 13-year-old proband
died suddenly at rest with no antecedent illness and no significant
findings at postmortem. Her father had sinus bradycardia with occasional
sinus pauses and ventricular ectopy together with profound prolongation
of his QT interval (QTc = 527 ms) (see LQT3; 603830). He experienced
only occasional light-headedness. Other family members experienced
occasional syncope and had sinus bradycardia and prolonged QT intervals
on their ECGs. In those individuals with prolonged QT intervals, SSCP
analysis detected an aberrant conformer in the coding region of the
SCN5A gene corresponding to the C terminus. Nucleotide sequencing
revealed a G-to-A transition at codon 1784, resulting in a glu-to-lys
substitution. This mutation occurs at a highly conserved residue in most
voltage-gated sodium channels in most animals, including invertebrates.
When the mutation was expressed in Xenopus oocytes, a defect in channel
inactivation was demonstrated in the form of a small residual steady
state current throughout prolonged depolarization. Wei et al. (1999)
explored this further by engineering SCN5A constructs with amino acid
substitutions at other positions in the C terminus. All exhibited
similar electrophysiologic phenotypes, suggesting that heterozygous
charge-neutralizing amino acid substitution at this site causes an
allosteric effect on sodium channel gating, resulting in delayed
myocardial repolarization. This provided a novel mechanism for LQT3.

Makita et al. (2008) genotyped 66 members of 44 LQT3 families of
multiple ethnicities and identified the E1784K mutation in 41
individuals from 15 (34%) of the kindreds, including the family
previously reported by Wei et al. (1999); the diagnoses in these
individuals included LQT3 syndrome, Brugada syndrome (601144), and/or
sinus node disease (see 608567). Heterologously expressed E1784K
channels showed a 15.0-mV negative shift in the voltage dependence of Na
channel inactivation and a 7.5-fold increase in flecainide affinity for
resting-state channels, properties also seen with other LQT3 mutations
associated with a mixed clinical phenotype. Furthermore, these
properties were absent in Na channels harboring the T1304M mutation,
which is associated with LQT3 without a mixed clinical phenotype. Makita
et al. (2008) suggested that a negative shift of steady-state Na channel
inactivation and enhanced tonic block by class IC drugs represent common
biophysical mechanisms underlying the phenotypic overlap of LQT3 and
Brugada syndromes, and further indicated that class IC drugs should be
avoided in patients with Na channels displaying these behaviors.

PROGRESSIVE FAMILIAL HEART BLOCK, TYPE IA
SCN5A, IVS22DS, T-C, +2

In a large French family with progressive heart block (113900), Schott
et al. (1999) identified a T-to-C transition in the highly conserved +2
donor splice site of intron 22 of the SCN5A gene. The abnormal
transcript predicted in-frame skipping of exon 22 and an impaired gene
product lacking the voltage-sensitive DIIIS4 segment.

HEART BLOCK, NONPROGRESSIVE
SCN5A, 1-BP DEL, 5280G

In a Dutch family with asymptomatic first-degree atrioventricular block
associated with right bundle branch block from birth, without apparent
progression (see 113900), Schott et al. (1999) identified a 1-bp
deletion (G) at nucleotide 5280 of the SCN5A gene, resulting in a
frameshift predicted to cause a premature stop codon.

BRUGADA SYNDROME 1
SCN5A, ARG1512TRP

In the screening of SCN5A in 6 individuals with Brugada syndrome
(601144), Rook et al. (1999) found missense mutations in the coding
region of the gene in 2: arg1512 to trp (R1512W) in the DIII-DIV
cytoplasmic linker, and ala1924 to thr (A1924T; 600163.0012) in the
C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. In 2 other patients mutations were
detected near intron/exon junctions. To assess the functional
consequences of the R1512W and A1924T mutations, wildtype and mutant
sodium channel proteins were expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Both missense
mutations affected channel function and seemed to be associated with an
increase in inward sodium current during the action potential upstroke.

BRUGADA SYNDROME 1, INCLUDED
SCN5A, 3-BP INS, 5537TGA

In a large Dutch family with electrocardiographic features both of LQT3
(603830) and Brugada syndrome (601144), Bezzina et al. (1999)
demonstrated a 3-bp insertion at nucleotide position 5537 of the SCN5A
gene, predicted to cause insertion of an aspartic acid residue at amino
acid position 1795 (1795insD) in the C-terminal domain of the protein.
Expression of this mutant channel protein in Xenopus oocytes permitted
characterization of defects in channel activation and inactivation when
compared to a wildtype control. These defects were predicted to cause a
reduction in sodium flux during the upstroke of the cardiac action
potential.

The co-occurrence of Brugada syndrome and long QT syndrome in this
family was paradoxical, since LQT3 is associated with activating SCN5A
mutations and Brugada syndrome with inactivating mutations. Clancy and
Rudy (2002) modeled the cellular effects of the 1795insD mutation in a
virtual transgenic cell. Since ion channel proteins are expressed
nonuniformly throughout the myocardium, there is an intrinsic
electrophysiologic heterogeneity. The authors demonstrated that the
interplay between this underlying myocardial electrophysiologic
heterogeneity and the mutation-induced changes in cardiac sodium channel
function provided the substrate for both ST segment elevation (in
Brugada syndrome) and QT prolongation (LQT3) in a rate-dependent manner.

.0014
VENTRICULAR FIBRILLATION, PAROXYSMAL FAMILIAL
SCN5A, SER1710LEU

Akai et al. (2000) screened 25 Japanese patients with idiopathic
ventricular fibrillation (603829). The diagnosis was based on the
occurrence of at least one episode of syncope and/or cardiac arrest and
documentation of ventricular fibrillation. Structural heart disorders
were excluded. Eighteen patients were diagnosed as Brugada syndrome. The
authors identified a heterozygous ser1710-to-leu missense mutation of
the SCN5A gene in a 39-year-old man who was admitted to the hospital for
recurrent syncope and suffered an episode of spontaneous ventricular
fibrillation while hospitalized. An implanted cardiac defibrillator was
successful in preventing further attacks of palpitation or syncope.
Brugada syndrome was not present. The paternal grandfather and a
paternal uncle had died suddenly in their sixth decade of unknown cause;
the parents and sibs were asymptomatic.

.0015
LONG QT SYNDROME 3
SCN5A, SER941ASN

Schwartz et al. (2000) described an infant who nearly died of SIDS
(272120), whose parents had normal QT intervals and in whom the long QT
syndrome (603830) was diagnosed with identification of a spontaneous
mutation of the SCN5A gene: a change of codon 941 from TCC (serine) to
AAC (asparagine). The patient had all the classic features of near-SIDS.
Before the episode, the infant appeared to be in perfect health. His age
at the time of the episode (7 weeks) was within the age range of 5 to 12
weeks during which the incidence of SIDS peaks. The parents found him
cyanotic, apneic, and pulseless. Ventricular fibrillation was documented
in an emergency room; this point is important given the frequent
statements that ventricular arrhythmias have not been recorded in
infants at risk for SIDS. Had the infant died--an outcome that was
almost a certainty in the absence of cardioversion--the absence of an
electrocardiogram and the normal QT intervals of both parents would have
eliminated suspicion of the long QT syndrome and would have prompted a
diagnosis of SIDS.

.0016
CARDIAC CONDUCTION DEFECT, NONPROGRESSIVE
SCN5A, GLY514CYS

Tan et al. (2001) studied a family who came to medical attention when
the proband, a 3-year-old girl, experienced episodes of fainting during
a febrile illness. Her 12-lead ECG showed characteristics of slow
conduction throughout the atria and ventricles, including broad P waves,
PR interval prolongation, and a wide QRS complex (see 113900).
Continuous monitoring revealed episodes of severe bradycardia (25
beats/minute). During these slow periods the cardiac rhythm was
maintained by infrequent atrioventricular nodal 'escape' impulses.
Conduction disturbance persisted after the febrile illness, but there
was no evidence of structural heart disease or systemic diseases
associated with conduction defects in children. Therapeutic intervention
with a dual-chamber pacemaker was initially limited by inability to pace
the atrium (maximal stimulus: 10 V, 1 ms); however, this difficulty
resolved with 1 week of empiric steroid treatment. During the 4 years
following diagnosis, the patient continuously required dual-chamber
pacing. The proband's 6-year-old sister was similarly affected and
required pacemaker implantation, with episodes of noncapture that
reproducibly resolved with corticosteroid therapy. Three other family
members with no structural heart disease had ECG evidence of conduction
slowing (prolonged PR and QRS intervals), but did not experience
bradycardia or require pacemaker implantation. All affected family
members had a G-to-T transversion in the first nucleotide of codon 514
in exon 12 of the SCN5A gene resulting in the replacement of glycine by
cysteine (G514C). Biophysical characterization of the mutant channel
showed that there were abnormalities in voltage-dependent gating
behavior that could be partially corrected by dexamethasone, consistent
with the salutary effects of glucocorticoids on the clinical phenotype.
Computational analysis predicts that the gating defects of G514C
selectively slow myocardial conduction, but do not provoke the rapid
cardiac arrhythmias associated previously with SCN5A mutations.

.0017
PROGRESSIVE FAMILIAL HEART BLOCK, TYPE IA
SCN5A, ASP1595ASN

Wang et al. (2002) reported a family in which the proband had presented
with first-degree atrioventricular block at the age of 9, progressing to
complete AV block by the age of 20 (113900). The proband's sister and
father had electrocardiographic evidence of right bundle branch block
and left axis deviation with normal PR intervals. The corrected QT
interval was normal (less than 420 ms) in all 3 individuals. Sequencing
of the coding region of SCN5A revealed a G-to-A mutation at nucleotide
position 4783, which replaced an aspartic acid residue at amino acid
position 1595 with asparagine (D1595N). The G4783A mutation was
engineered into a recombinant human heart sodium channel and transiently
coexpressed with human sodium channel beta-1 subunit (600760) in a
cultured mammalian cell line (tsA201). Functional characterization using
a patch-clamp technique revealed a significant defect in the kinetics of
fast-channel inactivation distinct from those of SCN5A mutations
reported in LQT3 (603830). The authors considered this a plausible
mechanism for the observed conduction system disease in this family.

.0018
PROGRESSIVE FAMILIAL HEART BLOCK, TYPE IA
SCN5A, GLN298SER

Wang et al. (2002) reported a child in whom second-degree
atrioventricular block had been diagnosed at the age of 6, progressing
to complete atrioventricular block by the age of 12 (113900). The
child's mother had a normal electrocardiogram and the father declined
testing. There was no family history of sudden death. Sequencing of the
coding region of SCN5A revealed a G-to-A mutation at nucleotide position
892 that replaced a glycine residue at amino acid position 298 with
serine (G298S). The G892A mutation was engineered into a recombinant
human heart sodium channel and transiently coexpressed with human sodium
channel beta-1 subunit (600760) in a cultured mammalian cell line
(tsA201). Functional characterization using a patch-clamp technique
revealed a significant defect in the kinetics of fast-channel
inactivation distinct from those of SCN5A mutations reported in LQT3
(603830). The authors considered this a plausible mechanism for the
observed conduction system disease in this family.

LONG QT SYNDROME 3
SCN5A, ALA997SER

In a 6-week-old male infant who died of SIDS (272120), Ackerman et al.
(2001) identified a heterozygous G-to-T transversion in the SCN5A gene,
resulting in an ala997-to-ser substitution. The mutation was not
detected in 800 control alleles. Ackerman et al. (2001) determined that
amino acid 997 is located in the cytoplasmic connector between the
second and third domains of the sodium channel and is highly conserved
across species. They demonstrated that the mutant SCN5A channel
expressed a sodium current characterized by slower decay and a 2- to
3-fold increase in late sodium current.

.0020
LONG QT SYNDROME 3
SCN5A, ARG1826HIS

In a 42-day-old male infant who died of possible SIDS (272120), Ackerman
et al. (2001) identified a heterozygous G-to-A replacement in the SCN5A
gene, resulting in an arg1826-to-his substitution. The mutation was not
detected in 800 control alleles. Ackerman et al. (2001) determined that
amino acid 1826 is located in the cytoplasmic C-terminal region of the
sodium channel and is highly conserved. They demonstrated that the SCN5A
mutant channel expressed a sodium current characterized by slower decay
and a 2- to 3-fold increase in late sodium current.

.0021
BRUGADA SYNDROME 1
SCN5A, ARG367HIS

Sudden unexplained nocturnal death syndrome (SUNDS), a disorder found in
southeast Asia, is characterized by an abnormal electrocardiogram with
ST-segment elevation in leads V1 to V3 and sudden death due to
ventricular fibrillation, identical to that seen in Brugada syndrome
(601144). Vatta et al. (2002) found mutations in the SCN5A gene in 3 of
10 Asian SUNDS patients. In a sporadic Asian SUNDS patient, the authors
identified a 1100G-A transition in SCN5A. The mutation is predicted to
result in an arg367-to-his (R367H) substitution, which lies in the first
P segment of the pore-lining region between the DIS5 and DIS6
transmembrane segments. In transfected Xenopus oocytes, the R367H mutant
channel did not express any current. The authors hypothesized that the
likely effect of this mutation is to depress peak current due to the
loss of one functional allele.

.0022
BRUGADA SYNDROME 1
SCN5A, ALA735VAL

In a family with SUNDS, a disorder identical to Brugada syndrome
(601144), that exhibited autosomal dominant inheritance, Vatta et al.
(2002) identified among affected members a 2204C-T transition, which is
predicted to result in an ala735-to-val (A735V) substitution. The
mutation lies in the first transmembrane segment of domain II, (DIIS1),
close to the first extracellular loop between DIIS1 and DIIS2. In
transfected Xenopus oocytes, the A735V mutant expressed currents with
steady-state activation voltage shifted to more positive potentials and
exhibited reduced sodium channel current at the end of phase I of the
action potential.

SCN5A, ARG1193GLN

In a pair of Japanese dizygotic twins, one of whom died at 4 months of
SUNDS, a disorder identical to Brugada syndrome (601144), Vatta et al.
(2002) identified a 3575G-A transition in exon 20 of the SCN5A gene,
predicted to result in an arg1192-to-gln (R1192Q) substitution in Domain
III. In transfected Xenopus oocytes, the mutation accelerated the
inactivation of the sodium channel current and exhibited reduced sodium
channel current at the end of phase I of the action potential. Wang
(2005) stated that this variant was mislabeled in the Vatta et al.
(2002) report and should be designated R1993Q.

In an 82-year-old Caucasian male who developed long QT syndrome after
the administration of D-sotolol or quinidine (see 603830), Wang et al.
(2004) identified heterozygosity for the R1993Q mutation in the SCN5A
gene. The mutation was found in 4 of 2,087 predominantly Caucasian
controls (0.2%). Electrophysiologic studies showed that mutant R1193Q
channels destabilize inactivation gating and generate a persistent,
nonactivating current that is expected to prolong the cardiac action
potential duration, leading to LQT syndrome; single channel recording
revealed the molecular mechanism to be frequent, dispersed reopening of
the channels. The patient also carried the H558R SCN5A variant
(600163.0031), but due to a lack of family members, it could not be
determined whether H558R was in cis or trans with R1993Q.

Hwang et al. (2005) found the R1993Q mutation in 11 of 94 (12%) randomly
selected Han Chinese individuals and concluded that the variant is a
common polymorphism in this population. None of the carriers had
electrocardiographic signs of Brugada syndrome, although 1 had a
prolonged QTc interval (472 ms) and another, who was homozygous for the
mutation, had a borderline long QTc (437 ms).

In an asymptomatic 73-year-old male member of a 4-generation Han Chinese
family with autosomal dominant cardiac arrhythmias and sudden death, Niu
et al. (2006) identified compound heterozygosity for R1193Q and a
nonsense mutation in the SCN5A gene (W1421X; 600163.0036). Niu et al.
(2006) suggested that the R1193Q mutation, which results in a gain of
sodium channel function, may compensate for the deleterious effects of
W1421X. Haplotype analysis of an asymptomatic daughter-in-law and 2
asymptomatic grandchildren who also carried the R1193Q mutation revealed
that the children inherited the mutation from their mother rather than
their grandfather.

SUDDEN INFANT DEATH SYNDROME, INCLUDED
SCN5A, SER1103TYR

Splawski et al. (2002) screened DNA samples from individuals with
nonfamilial cardiac arrhythmias and identified a C-to-A transversion in
the SCN5A gene leading to a ser1103-to-tyr (S1103Y) substitution 1
patient. Ackerman et al. (2004) noted that the variant was originally
published as SER1102TYR from numbering based on the 2,015 amino acid
alternatively spliced transcript. Subsequently, numbering was revised to
account for the full-length 2,016 amino acid transcript. Serine-1103 is
a conserved residue located in the intracellular sequences that link
domains II and III of the channel. The proband had idiopathic dilated
cardiomyopathy and hypokalemia and developed prolonged QT and torsade de
pointes ventricular tachycardia while on amiodarone. Splawski et al.
(2002) determined that the Y1103 allele is present in 19.2% of West
Africans and Caribbeans and in 13.2% of African Americans. The Y1103
allele was not found in 511 Caucasians or 578 Asians. Splawski et al.
(2002) studied 22 African Americans with acquired arrhythmia and 100
population-matched controls. The Y1103 allele was overrepresented among
arrhythmia patients, being found in 56.5% of cases and among 13% of
controls. The likelihood of displaying signs of arrhythmia in a Y1103
carrier heterozygote or homozygote yielded an odds ratio of 8.7 (95% CI
3.2 to 23.9). The odds ratio was not significantly altered after
controlling for age or gender. To determine whether this mutation is an
inherited risk factor for arrhythmias, Splawski et al. (2002) examined
the extended family of 1 proband. They ascertained and phenotypically
characterized 23 members of this kindred. Phenotypic analysis revealed
that 11 members of the family had prolonged QT and/or a history of
syncope. All 11 phenotypically affected members of this family carried
the Y1103 allele (6 were homozygotes and 5 were heterozygotes).
Physiologic analysis of the effect of this mutation recorded a small but
significant negative shift in the voltage dependence of activation.
Splawski et al. (2002) concluded that the Y1103 allele is a common SCN5A
variant in Africans and African Americans and causes a small but
inherent chronic risk of acquired arrhythmia. In the setting of
additional acquired risk factors, including medications, hypokalemia, or
structural heart disease, individuals carrying this allele are at
increased risk of arrhythmia.

In 3 white sisters and their father, Chen et al. (2002) identified the
S1103Y mutation, thus demonstrating that this mutation does exist in the
white population. The mutation was associated with a considerable risk
of syncope, ventricular arrhythmia, ventricular fibrillation, and sudden
death, Each of the 3 sibs was genotyped for 31 'ancestry informative
markers' to provide an estimation of biogeographic ancestry on 3 axes:
Native American, West African, and European. The maximum likelihood
point estimates for each of the sibs were 100% European, 0.0% African,
and 0.0% Native American. The proband had a baseline QTc of 520 ms, and
developed 2 episodes of syncope at age 49 years. The first episode was
triggered by emotion and excitement. The second episode occurred in the
setting of amiodarone and low serum potassium, and progressed to
ventricular fibrillation and cardiac arrest. She was resuscitated by
cardioversion. The second sister had a QTc of 431 ms, and died suddenly
at age 44 years when awakening from sleep. The third sister had a QTc of
452 ms, developed 1 episode of syncope at the age of 33 years, and had
complained of palpitations all her life. The father died suddenly in his
sleep at age 50 years. Family members without S1103Y had a normal QTc.

Plant et al. (2006) screened DNA samples from 133 African American
autopsy-confirmed cases of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS; 272120)
and identified 3 that were homozygous for the S1103Y variant. Among
1,056 African American controls, 120 were carriers of the heterozygous
genotype, suggesting that infants with 2 copies of S1103Y have a 24-fold
increased risk for SIDS. Variant Y1103 channels were found to operate
normally under baseline conditions in vitro. Because risk factors for
SIDS include apnea and respiratory acidosis, Y1103 and wildtype channels
were subjected to lowered intracellular pH; only Y1103 channels
developed abnormal function, with late reopenings suppressible by the
drug mexiletine. Plant et al. (2006) suggested that the Y1103 variant
confers susceptibility to acidosis-induced arrhythmia, a
gene-environment interaction.

Darbar et al. (2008) stated that the S1103Y variant was a known common
nonsynonymous polymorphism in the SCN5A gene; they detected S1103Y in 1
patient with lone atrial fibrillation and in 5 patients with atrial
fibrillation associated with other heart disease, as well as in 15 of
720 control chromosomes, for a minor allele frequency of 0.7%.

in a thr220-to-ile (T220I) mutation, and the maternal allele carried a

mutation slowed the onset of activation, but did not cause a marked

SCN5A, THR512ILE AND HIS558ARG

In a 2-year-old boy with second-degree atrioventricular conduction block
(113900) necessitating a pacemaker, Viswanathan et al. (2003) identified
a heterozygous 1535C-T transition in the SCN5A gene, resulting in a
thr512-to-ile (T512I) substitution. In addition, there was a homozygous
1673A-G transition, resulting in a his558-to-arg (H558R) substitution.
H558R (dbSNP rs1805124) is a polymorphism present in 20% of the
population (Yang et al., 2002). One of the patient's alleles contained
both T512I and H558R. The patient's father was heterozygous for the
H558R substitution, the asymptomatic mother was compound heterozygous
for the T512I and H558R substitutions, and 2 sibs were heterozygous for
the H558R substitution. Functional expression studies showed that
activation and inactivation of wildtype and H558R channels were similar.
By contrast, voltage-dependent activation and inactivation of the T512I
channel was shifted negatively by 8 to 9 mV and had enhanced slow
activation and slower recovery from inactivation compared to the
wildtype channel. Studies of the double H558R/T512I channel showed that
H558R eliminated the negative shift induced by T512I, but only partially
restored the kinetic abnormalities. Viswanathan et al. (2003) suggested
that enhanced slow inactivation disproportionately affected Purkinje
cells, which have a longer action potential duration and smaller
diastolic interval, resulting in slowed atrioventricular conduction.

Darbar et al. (2008) stated that the H558R variant was a known common
nonsynonymous polymorphism in the SCN5A gene; they detected H558R in 59
patients with lone atrial fibrillation and in 130 patients with atrial
fibrillation associated with other heart disease, as well as in 128 of
720 control chromosomes, for a minor allele frequency of approximately
25%.

BRUGADA SYNDROME 1
SCN5A, GLY1262SER

Shin et al. (2004) studied a family with 9 members as well as 12
unrelated sporadic cases, all Koreans, diagnosed with Brugada syndrome
(601144). They identified a novel missense mutation associated with
Brugada syndrome in the family: a single-nucleotide substitution of G to
A at nucleotide position 3934 in exon 21 of the SCN5A gene that changed
glycine-1262 to serine (G1262S) in segment 2 of domain III of the SCN5A
protein. Four individuals in the family carried the identical mutation,
but none of the 12 sporadic patients did. The mutation was not found in
150 unrelated normal individuals.

ATRIAL FIBRILLATION, FAMILIAL, 10, INCLUDED
SCN5A, GLU1053LYS

In a patient with Brugada syndrome (601144), Mohler et al. (2004)
identified a 3157G-A transition in the SCN5A gene resulting in a
glu1053-to-lys (E1053K) mutation in the ankyrin-binding motif of the
cardiac sodium channel. The mutation abolished binding of Na(v)1.5 to
ankyrin-G (600465) and also prevented accumulation of Na(v)1.5 at cell
surface sites in ventricular cardiomyocytes.

In a patient with lone atrial fibrillation (ATFB10; 614022), Darbar et
al. (2008) identified heterozygosity for the E1053K mutation in the
SCN5A gene. The mutation was not found in 720 control alleles.

SCN5A, ASP1275ASN

In a large family reported by Greenlee et al. (1986) with dilated
cardiomyopathy with conduction disorder and arrhythmia (CMD1E; 601154),
McNair et al. (2004) identified heterozygosity for a 3823G-A mutation in
exon 21 of the SCN5A gene, resulting in an asp1275-to-asn (D1275N)
substitution and predicting a change of charge within the S2 segment of
domain III. The mutation was present in 22 affected family members and
was not found in 300 control chromosomes.

Groenewegen et al. (2003) reported the D1275N mutation, coinherited with
polymorphisms in the atrial-specific gap junction channel protein
connexin-40 (GJA5; 121013), in affected members of a family with atrial
standstill (see 108770). No member of this family had dilated
cardiomyopathy, leading Groenewegen and Wilde (2005) to question whether
the D1275N mutation was the primary cause of dilated cardiomyopathy as
reported by McNair et al. (2004).

In affected members of a large Finnish family with atrial fibrillation
(AF) and conduction defects (ATFB10; 614022), Laitinen-Forsblom et al.
(2006) identified heterozygosity for the D1275N mutation in the SCN5A
gene. The mutation was not found in more than 370 control chromosomes.
Echocardiography revealed an enlarged left ventricle with an increased
end-diastolic left ventricular diameter in 1 affected individual, and
the right ventricle was slightly enlarged in 3 other affected
individuals.

.0035
LONG QT SYNDROME 2/3, DIGENIC
SCN5A, ASP1819ASN

In a 41-year-old female who had cardiac arrest due to torsade de pointes
triggered by exercise and leading to ventricular fibrillation, and a QTc
of 520 ms (see 603830), Millat et al. (2006) identified biallelic
digenic mutations: a 5455G-A transition in exon 28 of the SCN5A gene,
resulting in an asp1819-to-asn (D1819N) substitution; and a missense
mutation in the KCNH2 gene (R100G; 152427.0023).

.0036
BRUGADA SYNDROME 1
SCN5A, TRP1421TER

In affected members of a 4-generation Han Chinese family with autosomal
dominant cardiac arrhythmias and sudden death (601144), Niu et al.
(2006) identified heterozygosity for a G-A transition in exon 24 of the
SCN5A gene, resulting in a trp1421-to-ter (W1421X) substitution. The
mutation was not found in 95 control subjects. An asymptomatic
73-year-old male family member was found to be compound heterozygous for
W1421X and the R1993Q mutation (600163.0023). Niu et al. (2006)
suggested that R1193Q, which results in a gain of sodium channel
function, may compensate for the deleterious effects of W1421X.

SCN5A, THR220ILE

In a 54-year-old man with dilated cardiomyopathy (601154), atrial
fibrillation, and heart block, Olson et al. (2005) identified
heterozygosity for a 659C-T transition in exon 6 of the SCN5A gene,
resulting in a thr220-to-ile (T220I) substitution at a highly conserved
residue in the transmembrane domain. Coronary artery disease was
excluded by angiography; cardiac biopsy showed moderate myocyte
hypertrophy and marked interstitial fibrosis. He died 13 years later in
severe congestive heart failure. A female first cousin once removed who
also carried the mutation was diagnosed at 55 years of age with dilated
cardiomyopathy (ejection fraction, 10%) and incomplete bundle branch
block; she died 2 years later, also in severe congestive heart failure.
Other relatives were reported to have enlarged hearts, but were
unavailable for evaluation.

SCN5A, 2-BP INS, NT2550

In a man with dilated cardiomyopathy (601154) and monomorphic
ventricular tachycardia who later developed third-degree heart block
requiring pacemaker implantation, Olson et al. (2005) identified
heterozygosity for a 2-bp insertion (2550insTG) in exon 17 of the SCN5A
gene, resulting in a premature stop codon and a truncated protein.
Cardiac biopsy was normal. His father, who carried the mutation, was
diagnosed with CMD (ejection fraction, 30%), left bundle branch block,
and monomorphic ventricular tachycardia at age 67 years. The mutation
was also present in a paternal uncle who had sinus bradycardia,
first-degree heart block, and complete left bundle branch block; his
paternal grandfather developed congestive heart failure at 50 years of
age and died 6 years later, but DNA was unavailable for evaluation.

SCN5A, ASP1595HIS

In a 7-year-old boy with early manifestations of dilated cardiomyopathy
(601154) including sinus bradycardia, left ventricular dilation, and
normal contractile function, Olson et al. (2005) identified
heterozygosity for a 4783G-C transversion in exon 27 of the SCN5A gene,
resulting in an asp1595-to-his (D1595H) substitution at a highly
conserved residue in the transmembrane domain. The mutation was found in
DNA from postmortem tissue of a brother who died at 34 years of age with
an autopsy diagnosis of cardiomyopathy and only mild coronary artery
disease. The mutation was also identified in 2 sibs and a paternal
uncle, all of whom had sinus bradycardia, and a paternal aunt with
borderline left atrial enlargement. His father, an obligate mutation
carrier, had atrial fibrillation and died at 49 years of age from
pulmonary embolism; his paternal grandfather, a presumed mutation
carrier, developed congestive heart failure at 70 years of age.

.0040
BRUGADA SYNDROME 1
SCN5A, VAL232ILE and LEU1308PHE

In a 45-year-old black man with no history of cardiac disease who
developed monomorphic wide-complex ventricular tachycardia with right
precordial ST segment elevation consistent with Brugada syndrome (see
601144) after the administration of lidocaine, Barajas-Martinez et al.
(2008) identified 2 mutations in the SCN5A gene, a G-to-A transition in
exon 6 of the SCN5A gene, resulting in a val232-to-ile (V232I)
substitution in the C terminus of the transmembrane segment S4 of domain
I, and a C-to-T transition in exon 22, resulting in a leu1308-to-phe
(L1308F) substitution, in the C terminus of transmembrane segment S4 of
domain III. Although L1308F had previously been identified as a
polymorphism found mostly in Americans of African descent (Ackerman et
al., 2004), Barajas-Martinez et al. (2008) did not find either mutation
in over 400 alleles from 200 ethnically matched controls. The patient's
parents were unavailable for study, but given the severity of his
clinical manifestations, the authors strongly suspected that both
mutations were on the same allele (Dumaine, 2009). Using patch-clamp
techniques in mammalian TSA201 cells, Barajas-Martinez et al. (2008)
observed use-dependent inhibition of I(Na) by lidocaine that was more
pronounced in double-mutant channels than in wildtype; the individual
mutations produced a much less accentuated effect. The authors concluded
that the double mutation in SCN5A alters the affinity of the cardiac
sodium channel for lidocaine such that the drug assumes class IC
characteristics with potent use-dependent block of the sodium channel.

ATRIAL FIBRILLATION, FAMILIAL, 10
SCN5A, ASN1986LYS

In a father and son with atrial fibrillation (ATFB10; 614022), Ellinor
et al. (2008) identified heterozygosity for a 5958C-A transversion in
the SCN5A gene, resulting in an asn1986-to-lys (N1986K) substitution in
the C-terminal region of the protein. The mutation was not found in more
than 600 ethnically and racially matched control chromosomes. Expression
of the N1986K mutant in Xenopus oocytes revealed a hyperpolarizing shift
in channel steady-state inactivation.

.0042
ATRIAL FIBRILLATION, FAMILIAL, 10
SCN5A, HIS445ASP

In white male proband who was diagnosed with paroxysmal lone atrial
fibrillation (ATFB10; 614022) at 39 years of age, Darbar et al. (2008)
identified heterozygosity for a G-to-C transversion in the SCN5A gene,
resulting in a his445-to-asp (H445D) substitution at a highly conserved
residue that was predicted to perturb cardiac sodium channel function.
The proband had left atrial enlargement and an ejection fraction of 60%
by transthoracic echocardiography. The mutation was also detected in his
affected father and brother, but was not found in an unaffected sister
or in 720 control alleles.

In a black male proband who was diagnosed with paroxysmal lone atrial
fibrillation (ATFB10; 614022) at 17 years of age, Darbar et al. (2008)
identified heterozygosity for a G-to-C transversion in the SCN5A gene,
resulting in an asn470-to-lys (N470K) substitution at a highly conserved
residue and predicted to perturb cardiac sodium channel function. The
proband had left atrial enlargement with an ejection fraction of 60% by
transthoracic echocardiography. The mutation was also detected in his
affected mother and maternal grandmother, but was not found in an
unaffected maternal aunt or in 720 control alleles.

In a white male proband who was diagnosed with paroxysmal lone atrial

identified heterozygosity for a A-to-G transversion in the SCN5A gene,
resulting in an glu428-to-lys (E428K) substitution at a highly conserved
residue and predicted to perturb cardiac sodium channel function. The
proband had left atrial enlargement with an ejection fraction of 58% by
transthoracic echocardiography. The mutation was also detected in his
affected daughter and granddaughter, but was not found in an unaffected
daughter and granddaughter or in 720 control alleles.

In a white female proband who was diagnosed with paroxysmal lone atrial
fibrillation (ATFB10; 614022) at 37 years of age, Darbar et al. (2008)
identified heterozygosity for an A-to-G transition in the SCN5A gene,
resulting in a glu655-to-lys (E655K) substitution at a highly conserved
residue that was predicted to perturb cardiac sodium channel function.
The proband had a normal-sized left atrium and ventricle with an
ejection fraction of 55% by transthoracic echocardiography. The mutation
was also detected in her affected daughter and maternal grandmother, but
was not found in 720 control alleles.

CARDIOMYOPATHY, DILATED, 1E
SCN5A, ARG222GLN (dbSNP rs45546039)

In 6 affected members over 3 generations of a non-Hispanic white family
with cardiomyopathy and conduction system disease (CMD1E; 601154),
Hershberger et al. (2008) identified heterozygosity for a 36683G-A
(numbering per SeattleSNP) transition in exon 6 of the SCN5A gene,
resulting in an arg222-to-gln (R222Q) substitution at a conserved
residue. The mutation was not found in unaffected family members or in
253 controls.

In 19 affected individuals from 3 unrelated 3-generation families with
multifocal ectopic Purkinje-related premature contractions and dilated
cardiomyopathy (CMD), Laurent et al. (2012) identified heterozygosity
for the 665G-A (R222Q) mutation in the SCN5A gene, located in the
voltage-sensing S4 segment of domain I. The mutation, which was fully
penetrant and strictly segregated with the cardiac phenotype in each
family, was not found in 600 control chromosomes; haplotype analysis
showed that a founder effect for these 3 families was very unlikely. In
vitro studies recapitulated the normalization of the ventricular action
potentials in the presence of quinidine. Because only 6 of the 19
patients carrying the R222Q mutation had CMD, and the cardiomyopathy
recovered at least partially with antiarrhythmia treatment and a
reduction in the number of premature ventricular contractions, Laurent
et al. (2012) suggested that CMD might be a consequence of the
arrhythmia and not directly linked to the mutation.

In affected members of a 3-generation Canadian family with CMD and
junctional escape ventricular capture bigeminy, Nair et al. (2012)
identified the R222Q mutation in the SCN5A gene. Heterologous expression
studies in Chinese hamster ovary K1 cells revealed a unique biophysical
phenotype of R222Q channels in which an approximately 10-mV leftward
shift in the sodium current steady-state activation curve occurs without
corresponding shifts in steady-state inactivation at cardiomyocyte
resting membrane-potential voltages. The activation and inactivation of
cells expressing equimolar combinations of wildtype and R222Q channels
showed properties intermediate between those seen in cells expressing
either wildtype or mutant channels alone. The changes in mutant channel
properties were predicted to produce hyperexcitability of R222Q sodium
channels.

In 16 affected members over 3 generations of a large kindred with CMD
and multiple arrhythmias, including premature ventricular complexes
(PVCs) of variable morphology, Mann et al. (2012) identified
heterozygosity for the R222Q mutation in the SCN5A gene. The mutation
was also identified in 1 clinically unaffected family member, a
56-year-old man with a normal EKG and echocardiogram, but was not found
in 200 control chromosomes. Patch-clamp studies showed that the R222Q
mutation did not alter sodium channel current density, but did shift
steady-state parameters of activation and inactivation to the left.
Using a voltage ramp protocol, normalized current responses of mutant
channels were of earlier onset and greater magnitude than wildtype.
Action potential modeling using Purkinje fiber and ventricular cell
models suggested that rate-dependent ectopy of Purkinje fiber origin is
the predominant ventricular effect of the R222Q variant; this was
supported by the clinical observation that PVC frequency increased
during periods of low heart rate at rest and at night, and was reduced
by high heart rates during exercise. Patients responded to
sodium-channel blocking drugs with early and substantial reductions in
PVCs followed by normalization of CMD over time.

In 3 affected members over 2 generations of an African American family

Hershberger et al. (2008) identified heterozygosity for a 99599T-C
transition (numbering per SeattleSNP) in exon 28 of the SCN5A gene,
resulting in an ile1835-to-thr (I1835T) substitution at a conserved
residue. The mutation was not found in unaffected family members or in
253 controls.

612993	TITLE *612993 FILAMIN A-INTERACTING PROTEIN 1-LIKE; FILIP1L
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Kwon et al. (2008) stated that the 893-amino acid FILIP1L protein shares
46% identity with FILIP1 (607307). FILIP1L contains an extended
coiled-coil region in its N-terminal half that includes 2 leucine zipper
motifs and a prefoldin (see 604897) domain. The N-terminal half of
FILIP1L shares significant similarity with bacterial SbcC, an ATPase
involved in DNA repair, and the C-terminal half of FILIP1L shares
similarity with herpes virus major outer envelope glycoprotein. A second
FILIP1L isoform has an N-terminal extension and contains 1,135 amino
acids. Western blot analysis of fractionated human umbilical vein
endothelial cells (HUVECs) detected FILIP1L at an apparent molecular
mass of 110 kD predominantly in the cytoplasm, with less expression in
membrane and nuclear fractions. Immunohistochemical analysis of normal
human colon tissue detected FILIP1L in the vasculature and muscularis
mucosa. In colon cancer, FILIP1L was expressed in the vasculature and
tumor stroma. Kwon et al. (2008) noted that FILIP1L orthologs have only
been found in mammals.

GENE FUNCTION

Kwon et al. (2008) found that expression of FILIP1L was upregulated in
HUVECs following treatment with angiogenesis inhibitors, with strong
punctate FILIP1L staining in the cytoplasm. Overexpression of FILIP1L in
endothelial cells led to inhibition of cell proliferation and increased
apoptosis. Truncation of FILIP1L after residue 790 increased its ability
to inhibit cell proliferation. Expression of truncated FILIP1L in human
melanoma cells inhibited tumor growth following injection in nude mice.
Tumors of these mice showed reduced vascular density and extensive
apoptosis compared with tumors grown from cells lacking truncated
FILIP1L.

MAPPING

Kwon et al. (2008) stated that the FILIP1L gene maps to chromosome
3q12.1.

602024	TITLE *602024 CHLORIDE CHANNEL, KIDNEY, A; CLCNKA
;;CLCK1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The CLCNKA gene, a member of the chloride channel (ClC) family, encodes
a kidney-specific chloride channel that mediates transepithelial
chloride transport in the thin ascending limb of the Henle loop (tAL) in
the inner medulla (Matsumura et al., 1999). Transport of NaCl in the tAL
is thought to be a component of urinary concentration in a passive model
of the countercurrent multiplication system. Each member of the ClC
family is thought to have 12 transmembrane domains and intracellular N
and C termini (Jentsch and Gunther, 1997).

CLONING

Kieferle et al. (1994) cloned 2 closely related putative chloride
channels from both rat kidney and human kidney. The human genes,
designated ClCK1 and ClCK2 (CLCNKB; 602023) by them, each comprise 687
amino acids and share approximately 90% identity.

GENE STRUCTURE

Simon et al. (1997) demonstrated that the intron-exon organization of
the CLCNKA and CLCNKB genes is identical, with each channel encoded by
19 exons. Overall, the genes show 94% DNA sequence identity in exons.
The 2 genes are transcribed from the same DNA strand, with CLCNKA
5-prime of CLCNKB. The 2 genes are separated by 11 kb of genomic DNA.

MAPPING

Saito-Ohara et al. (1996) mapped the CLCNKA and CLCNKB genes to
chromosome 1p36 by in situ hybridization. Simon et al. (1997) confirmed
that the CLCNKA and CLCNKB genes map to chromosome 1.

GENE FUNCTION

Estevez et al. (2001) demonstrated that barttin (BSND; 606412) acts as
an essential beta subunit for CLCNKA and CLCNKB chloride channels, with
which it colocalizes in basolateral membranes of renal tubules and of
potassium-secreting epithelia of the inner ear. Disease-causing
mutations in either CLCNKB or barttin compromise currents through
heteromeric channels. Currents can be stimulated further by mutating a
proline-tyrosine (PY) motif on barttin. Estevez et al. (2001) concluded
that their work described the first known beta subunit for CLC chloride
channels and revealed that heteromers formed by chloride channels and
barttin are crucial for renal salt reabsorption and potassium recycling
in the inner ear.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a child with renal salt wasting and deafness (Bartter syndrome type
4B; 613090) who had no mutation in the BSND gene (606412), Schlingmann
et al. (2004) identified both a homozygous deletion of the CLCNKB gene
(602023.0008) and a homozygous trp80-to-cys mutation in the CLCNKA gene
(W80C; 602024.0001). Because this combined impairment of the CLCNKA and
CLCNKB genes resulted in a phenotype mimicking the form of infantile
Bartter syndrome with sensorineural deafness caused by mutation in the
BSND gene (Bartter syndrome type 4A; 602522), Schlingmann et al. (2004)
concluded that this case supported the notion that the CLCK-type
channels are regulated by barttin and offered strong evidence of genetic
heterogeneity in patients who have both severe renal salt wasting and
deafness.

Nozu et al. (2008) reported a 2-year-old Japanese girl with a severe
form of Bartter syndrome with sensorineural deafness who was born of
nonconsanguineous parents. Genetic analysis showed 2 heterozygous
mutations in the CLCNKA (602024.0002) and CLCNKB (602023.0011) genes on
the paternal allele, and a 12-kb deletion involving portions of the
CLCNKA and CLCNKB genes on the maternal allele. Neither parent was
clinically affected. The findings indicated clear digenic inheritance in
this patient and confirmed that loss of function of all 4 alleles of the
CLCNKA and CLCNKB genes can result in Bartter syndrome type 4B.

ANIMAL MODEL

Matsumura et al. (1999) provided direct evidence that CLCK1 is involved
in urine concentration. To analyze the physiologic function of CLCK1 in
vivo, they generated mice lacking CLC-K1 by targeted gene disruption.
Clcnk1 -/- mice were normal in physical appearance but produced
approximately 5 times more urine than did heterozygous or homozygous
normal mice. After 24 hours of water deprivation, the homozygous
deficient mice were severely dehydrated and lethargic, with a decrease
of approximately 27% in body weight. Intraperitoneal injection of dDAVP
(1-desamino-8D-arginine vasopressin) induced a 3-fold increase in urine
osmolarity in heterozygous and homozygous normal mice, whereas only a
minimal increase was seen in the homozygous deficient mice, indicating
nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. After in vitro perfusion of the tAL, the
lumen-to-bath chloride gradient did not produce a diffusion potential in
the homozygous deficient mice in contrast to the homozygous normal and
heterozygous mice. These results established that CLCK1 has a role in
urine concentration, and that the countercurrent system in the inner
medulla is involved in the generation and maintenance of hypertonic
medullary interstitium. Matsumura et al. (1999) suggested that mutations
of CLCNKA may be associated with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus in those
cases where mutations in the vasopressin V2 receptor (AVPR2; 300538) and
the AQP2 water channel (107777) are lacking.

In a child with renal salt wasting and deafness (Bartter syndrome type
4B; 613090) who had no mutation in the BSND gene (606412), Schlingmann
et al. (2004) identified both a homozygous deletion of the CLCNKB gene
(602023.0008) and a homozygous G-to-C transversion in exon 3 of the
CLCNKA gene, resulting in a cys80-to-trp (C80W) mutation. The patient
was born prematurely to consanguineous parents, and the pregnancy was
complicated by severe maternal polyhydramnios during the last 6 weeks of
gestation.

CLCNKA, GLN260TER

In a 2-year-old Japanese girl with a severe form of Bartter syndrome
with sensorineural deafness (613090), Nozu et al. (2008) identified a
heterozygous 778C-T transition in exon 7 of the CLCNKA gene, resulting
in a gln260-to-ter (Q260X) substitution, and a heterozygous splice site
mutation in the CLCNKB gene (602023.0011), both inherited from the
father. The maternal allele had a 12-kb deletion including portions of
both CLCNKA and CLCNKB. Neither parent was clinically affected. The
findings indicated clear digenic inheritance in this patient and
confirmed that loss of function of all 4 alleles of the CLCNKA and
CLCNKB genes can result in Bartter syndrome type 4B.

613746	TITLE *613746 BREAST CANCER ANTIESTROGEN RESISTANCE 4; BCAR4
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching for genes involved in antiestrogen resistance in breast
cancer, Godinho et al. (2010) identified BCAR4. The deduced BCAR4
protein contains 2 transmembrane domains.

GENE FUNCTION

Godinho et al. (2010) found that upregulation of BCAR4 mRNA in breast
cancer was associated with unfavorable response to tamoxifen treatment
and poor survival. Transfection of BCAR4 into ZR-75-1 breast cancer
cells increased the phosphorylation of ERBB2 (164870) and ERBB3
(190151), resulting in activation of AKT (see 164730) and ERK1 (MAPK3;
601795)/ERK2 (MAPK1; 176948). Knockdown of ERBB2, ERBB3, or ERBB4
(600543) via small interfering RNA inhibited proliferation in
BCAR4-overexpressing cells in the presence of 4-hydroxytamoxifen or
estradiol.

MAPPING

Hartz (2011) mapped the BCAR4 gene to chromosome 16p13.13 based on an
alignment of the BCAR4 sequence (GenBank GENBANK CR606007) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

150340	TITLE *150340 LAMIN B1; LMNB1
;;LMNB
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Lamins are the major components of the nuclear lamina which underlies
the nuclear envelope of eukaryotic cells (see lamin A, 150330). Maeno et
al. (1995) noted that lamins are members of the intermediate filament
protein family. Vertebrate lamins are classified into 2 types, A and B,
and mammalian somatic cells show 2 species of each type: lamins A and C
for the A type and B1 and B2 for the B type. In addition,
germ-cell-specific lamins have been reported for both types (Furukawa
and Hotta, 1993 and Furukawa et al., 1994). Whereas A-type lamins are
expressed in a developmentally controlled manner, B-type lamins are
expressed in all kinds of cells.

CLONING

Pollard et al. (1990) cloned a lamin B cDNA from the human T-cell line
MOLT-4. LMNB1 encodes a deduced 586-amino acid protein with a calculated
molecular mass of 66,334 Da. The LMNB1 protein shares approximately 72%
sequence similarity with lamin A/C (150330).

GENE FUNCTION

Lamin B, a component of the interphase nuclear lamina, is required to
maintain nuclear shape and mechanical integrity (Goldman et al., 2002).

Tsai et al. (2006) reported that lamin B has a role in spindle assembly.
Lamin B assembled into a matrix-like network in mitosis through a
process that depended on the presence of the GTP-bound form of the small
guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) Ran (601179). Depletion of lamin B
resulted in defects in spindle assembly. Dominant-negative mutant lamin
B proteins that disrupt lamin B assembly in interphase nuclei also
disrupted spindle assembly in mitosis. Furthermore, lamin B was
essential for the formation of the mitotic matrix that tethers a number
of spindle assembly factors. Tsai et al. (2006) proposed that lamin B is
a structural component of the long-sought-after spindle matrix that
promotes microtubule assembly and organization in mitosis.

Kim et al. (2011) found that mouse embryonic stem cells do not need any
lamins for self-renewal and pluripotency. Although genomewide lamin-B
binding profiles correlate with reduced gene expression, such binding is
not directly required for gene silencing in embryonic stem cells or
trophectoderm cells. However, B-type lamins are required for proper
organogenesis. Defects in spindle orientation in neural progenitor cells
and migration of neurons probably cause brain disorganizations found in
lamin-B-null mice. Kim et al. (2011) concluded that their studies not
only disprove several prevailing views of lamin-Bs but also establish a
foundation for redefining the function of the nuclear lamina in the
context of tissue building and homeostasis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lin and Worman (1995) determined that the human LMNB1 gene contains 11
exons. The transcription unit spans more than 45 kb and the
transcription start site is 348 nucleotides upstream from the
translation initiation codon. Exon 1 codes for the N-terminal head
domain and the first portion of the central rod domain, exons 2 through
6 the central rod domain, and exons 7 through 11 the C-terminal tail
domain. Intron positions are conserved in other lamin genes from frogs,
mice, and humans but different in lamin genes from Drosophila and C.
elegans.

Maeno et al. (1995) demonstrated that the mouse lamin B1 gene spans
about 43 kb of the genome and contains 11 exons, Exon/intron structure
of the B1 gene clearly showed the conserved organization among the
intermediate filament protein family genes. The presumptive promoter
region has high GC content and contains a CAAT box and multiple Sp1
sites but no classical TATA box, suggesting to the authors that the
lamin B1 gene has a typical housekeeping gene promoter with a CpG
island.

MAPPING

The lamin B gene in the mouse is located on chromosome 18 (Justice et
al., 1992) in a region of linkage homology to the long arm of human
chromosome 5. Wydner et al. (1996) mapped the human LMNB1 gene to
5q23.3-q31.1 by fluorescence in situ hybridization.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Padiath et al. (2006) identified a tandem genomic duplication resulting
in an extra copy of the LMNB1 gene (150340.0001) as the cause of
adult-onset autosomal dominant leukodystrophy (ADLD; 169500), a slowly
progressive neurologic disorder characterized by symmetric widespread
myelin loss in the central nervous system. The duplication was
identified by sequencing genomic DNA from affected individuals and also
from mouse-human hybrid cell lines derived from cells of affected
individuals. The hybrid cell lines enabled Padiath et al. (2006) to
separate chromosomes derived from each of the 2 parents of an individual
and to assign phase unambiguously when identifying sequencing variants.
They constructed a haplotype map of the chromosome carrying the
disease-causing mutation and observed a large shared haplotype block in
the critical region, suggesting that the 2 families arose from a common
founder. Increased expression of lamin B1 in Drosophila melanogaster
resulted in a degenerative phenotype. In addition, an abnormal nuclear
morphology was apparent when cultured cells overexpressed this protein.
Padiath et al. (2006) stated that ADLD was the first human disease
attributable to mutations in the gene encoding lamin in the LMNB1 gene.
Antibodies to lamin B are found in individuals with autoimmune diseases,
and it is also an antigen recognized by a monoclonal antibody raised
against plaques from brains of individuals with multiple sclerosis
(126200). This raised the possibility that lamin B may be a link to the
autoimmune attack that occurs in multiple sclerosis.

Brussino et al. (2009) found a 140- to 190-kb duplication of 5q
including the entire LMNB1 gene, the AX748201 transcript, and the
3-prime end of the MARCH3 gene (613333) in 1 of 8 Italian probands with
adult-onset leukoencephalopathy. The patient's affected cousin also
carried the duplication, and there was a family history of a similar
disorder. Lamin B1 expression was increased in lymphoblasts from one of
the patients with the duplication.

In affected members of 4 unrelated families with ADLD, Schuster et al.
(2011) found duplication of the LMNB1 gene. All 4 duplications were of
different sizes, ranging from 107 to 218 kb, supporting independent
events. Five patients from 2 families had about a 2-fold increased level
of LMNB1 protein in white blood cells, and LMNB1 mRNA was also increased
compared to controls. Each duplication extended over part of the MARCH3
gene, but MARCH3 mRNA was not increased in patient leukocytes. Schuster
et al. (2011) concluded that an accurate molecular diagnosis of the
disorder could be made by direct analysis of LMNB1 in peripheral
leukocytes.

ANIMAL MODEL

Mutations affecting A-type lamins have been associated with a variety of
human diseases, including muscular dystrophy (e.g., 181350),
cardiomyopathy (e.g., 115200), lipodystrophy (e.g., 151660), and
progeria (176670), but mutations in B-type lamins had not been
identified in humans or in experimental animals. To investigate the in
vivo function of lamin B1, Vergnes et al. (2004) generated mice with an
insertional mutation in Lmnb1. The mutation resulted in the synthesis of
a mutant lamin B1 protein lacking several key functional domains,
including a portion of the rod domain, the nuclear localization signal,
and the CAAX motif (the C-terminal signal for farnesylation). Homozygous
Lmnb1 mutant mice survived embryonic development but died at birth with
defects in lung and bone. Fibroblasts from mutant embryos grew under
standard cell culture conditions but displayed grossly misshapen nuclei,
impaired differentiation, increased polyploidy, and premature
senescence. Thus, the lamin B1 mutant mice provided evidence for a broad
and nonredundant function of lamin B1 in mammalian development.

LMNB1, DUP, Chr5:126,102,443-126,199,753 SRO, GRCh37

In 2 families of Irish American descent and in 2 other families with
autosomal dominant adult-onset leukodystrophy (169500), Padiath et al.
(2006) found a duplication of the LMNB1 gene and part of the MARCH3 gene
(613333). Haplotype analysis suggested that the 2 Irish American
families arose through a common founder.

In affected members of 4 unrelated families with ADLD, Schuster et al.
(2011) found duplication of the LMNB1 gene and part of the MARCH3 gene.
All 4 duplications were of different sizes, ranging from 107 to 218 kb,
supporting independent events. Five patients from 2 families had about a
2-fold increased level of LMNB1 protein in white blood cells, and LMNB1
mRNA was also increased compared to controls. MARCH3 mRNA was not
increased in patient leukocytes. Schuster et al. (2011) concluded that
an accurate molecular diagnosis of the disorder could be made by direct
analysis of LMNB1 in peripheral leukocytes.

In a symptomatic man with ADLD and his asymptomatic sister who had
leukodystrophy on brain imaging, Dos Santos et al. (2012) identified a
148-kb duplication on chromosome 5q23.2 including the LMNB1 gene, but
not the MARCH3 gene. The findings confirmed the central role of the
LMNB1 gene in ADLD.

Using a custom array, Giorgio et al. (2013) performed detailed
breakpoint junction sequence analysis of the duplicated 5q23 region
containing the LMNB1 gene in 20 independent families with ADLD in whom
genomic LMNB1 duplication was initially identified by aCGH, QT-PCR, or
MLPA. Seven families had previously been reported (Brussino et al.,
2009; Schuster et al., 2011; Dos Santos et al., 2012). There were a
total of 16 unique rearrangements. Three of the duplications were shared
by more than 1 family: 1 was found in 3 families and the other 2
duplications were found in 2 families each. Individuals with identical
junctions shared the same haplotype, consistent with a founder effect.
Duplication sizes ranged from about 128 kb to 475 kb. The largest
duplication also included the PHAX (604924), ALDH7A1 (107323), and
GRAMD3 genes. Comparison of all the samples identified a 72-kb minimal
critical duplicated region required for ADLD that contained only the
LMNB1 gene. All but 1 of the duplications were in the direct tandem
orientation; the remaining duplication was inverted. Characterization of
the junction sequences showed that most (11 of 15) showed short
stretches of microhomology overlap ranging from 1 to 6 nucleotides,
whereas the others showed small insertions at the breakpoints. All
duplications resulted from intrachromosomal rearrangements. Analysis of
the genomic architecture suggested several potential mechanisms for the
duplications, including nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) or fork
stalling and template switching/microhomology-mediated break-induced
repair (FoSTeS/MMBIR). The enrichment of Alu repetitive elements at the
centromeric breakpoints (found in 4 cases), higher GC content, and high
frequency of repetitive sequences at breakpoints likely also played a
role in mediating ADLD duplications. RT-PCR of patients fibroblasts or
blood showed increased LMNB1 expression (2.1- to 4.8-fold compared to
controls), as well as increased protein levels (1.6- to 3.2-fold
compared to controls). There was no apparent difference in phenotype
according to duplication size, with the exception of the 1 family with a
large inverted duplication affecting multiple genes.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The CYP21A2 gene encodes the 21-hydroxylase enzyme (EC 1.14.99.10),
which is essential for adrenal steroidogenesis (summary by Araujo et
al., 2007).

CLONING

White et al. (1986) found that cDNA corresponding to 21-hydroxylase is 2
kb long. The encoded protein is predicted to contain 494 amino acids
with a molecular weight of 55,000. The enzyme is at most 28% homologous
to other cytochrome P450 enzymes that have been studied.

GENE STRUCTURE

The gene encoding 21-hydroxylase contains 10 exons; the genes for other
P450 enzymes contain 7, 8, or 9 exons. The inactive A gene has an 8-base
deletion in codons 110 through 112, resulting in a frameshift that
brings a stop codon into the reading frame at codon 130; a second
frameshift and a nonsense mutation occur farther downstream. The two
P450C21 genes have 9 introns and are about 3.4 kb long (Higashi et al.,
1986).

MAPPING

Carroll et al. (1985) identified two 21-hydroxylase genes situated in
the following relationship to C4A and C4B:
5-prime--C4A--21-OHA--C4B--21-OHB- -3-prime. White et al. (1985)
presented evidence for the existence of 2 genes encoding steroid
21-hydroxylase in the C4 gene region, i.e., among the MHC class III
genes. The order appears to be:
centromere--GLO--DP--DQ--DR--C2--BF--C4A--21OHA--C4B--2 1OHB--B--C--A.
The 21-hydroxylase B gene and the adjacent C4B gene appear to be deleted
on the chromosome carrying HLA-Bw47 and the allele for salt-wasting
21-hydroxylase deficiency. In contrast, the chromosome carrying the
HLA-A1;B8;DR3 haplotype is not associated with 21-hydroxylase deficiency
and in the conclusions of White et al. (1985) based on restriction
enzyme analysis may have a deletion of the C4A and 21OHA genes. This
suggests that the latter is not functional. (In the human, the
21-hydroxylase B gene is functional; the A gene is missing 8 basepairs
from exon 2. In the mouse, the 21-hydroxylase A gene is functional; the
B gene is missing 215 basepairs from exon 2.)

The 21-hydroxylase pseudogene, symbolized CYP21P or CYP21A, is situated
on 6p, close to the functional gene, CYP21. Higashi et al. (1986)
suggested that this particular genomic anatomy predisposes the
functional gene to mutation through gene conversion or through deletion
by homologous recombination and unequal crossing-over.

Higashi et al. (1986) confirmed close linkage to C4 by finding that the
cloned P450C21 genes hybridized with the 5-prime or 3-prime end regions
of human C4 DNA. The P450C21 gene that is nonfunctional is identical to
the other except for 3 mutations, each of which is capable of causing
premature termination: a 1-base insertion, an 8-base deletion, and a
transition mutation. Higashi et al. (1986) suggested that tandem
arrangement of the highly homologous pseudo- and genuine genes in close
proximity could account for the high incidence of P450C21 gene
deficiency or defect through nonhomologous pairing and unequal
crossing-over.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

White et al. (1984) demonstrated that the mutations in the several forms
of congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency
involve the structural gene for the adrenal microsomal cytochrome P450
specific for steroid 21-hydroxylation (EC 1.14.99.10). Rodrigues et al.
(1987) pointed out that 21-hydroxylation was the first enzymatic
activity ascribed to any cytochrome P450 (Cooper et al., 1965).

Rodrigues et al. (1987) determined the nucleotide sequence of the
21-hydroxylase B gene in a patient with congenital adrenal hyperplasia.
Eleven nucleotide differences from the normal were found: 2 in the
5-prime flanking region, 4 in introns, 1 in the 3-prime untranslated
region, and 4 in exons. Two of the differences in exons caused codon
changes: serine-269 to threonine and asparagine-494 to serine. Rodrigues
et al. (1987) confirmed that the 21-hydroxylase A gene is a pseudogene
due to 3 deleterious mutations in the exons. Comparison of published
sequences with those they determined suggested that the 21-hydroxylase B
gene is polymorphic. They suggested, as had others, that the 4 distinct
clinical forms of 21-hydroxylase deficiency (simple virilizing,
salt-wasting, late-onset, and cryptic) may be the consequence of
different allelic mutations in the 21-hydroxylase B gene.

Jospe et al. (1987) performed genomic restriction analysis of 14
unrelated patients with salt-losing congenital adrenal hyperplasia,
identifying 3 patterns of mutation in the CA21HB gene: in 16 of the 28
chromosomes (or haplotypes) analyzed, there was no detectable
restriction fragment abnormality suggesting that these were point
mutations or small deletions or insertions. Complete deletion of CA21HB
was found in 9 of 28 haplotypes (32%). In 3 of 28 haplotypes (11%),
apparent conversion of CA21HB to the pseudogene CA21HA had occurred.
Jospe et al. (1987) described how apparent gene conversion could be
detected in the restriction fragment patterns. An alternative
explanation to conversion is that unequal crossing-over occurred between
a haplotype of 2 CA21HA genes and 1 CA21HB gene, and a normal haplotype
to produce loss of the CA21HB gene from the first haplotype but
retention of 2 CA21HA genes. CA21HB deletion was associated with
HLA-Bw47 in 6 haplotypes and with absent C4B expression in 7 haplotypes
of the 9.

In studies of DNA from 20 patients with 21-hydroxylase deficiency,
Rumsby et al. (1986) found one homozygous for a deletion encompassing
the C4B and 21-hydroxylase genes. They presented evidence that this
originated by recombination between homologous regions of 21-hydroxylase
A and B. No alteration in the 21-hydroxylase gene was detected in 12
patients. Seven patients appeared to be heterozygous for the above
deletion; i.e., they were genetic compounds.

In molecular studies of the C4/21-hydroxylase genes in patients with the
classic salt-wasting form, Schneider et al. (1986) found deletion of C4B
and 21-hydroxylase B genes in some. In 2, only the 21-hydroxylase B gene
was deleted. Werkmeister et al. (1986) found deletion of the active
CA21H gene in almost one-fourth of classic cases of 21-hydroxylase
deficiency, whereas mild 'nonclassic' 21-hydroxylase deficiency was
associated with a duplicated CA21H gene.

Using multiple restriction enzymes in the analysis of the 21-hydroxylase
gene in 10 families, each of which included 2 or more affected persons,
Matteson et al. (1987) concluded that the 'deletions' that have been
reported as a frequent finding in CAH patients probably represent gene
conversions, unequal crossovers, and polymorphisms rather than simple
gene deletions. Miller (1987) challenged the interpretation of a high
frequency of gene deletion underlying 21-hydroxylase deficiency. White
et al. (1987) defended their interpretation. They reiterated their view
that probes for the closely linked and highly polymorphic HLA genes
should be used for prenatal diagnosis, not CYP21 probes (Mornet et al.,
1986).

By Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA using a 21-hydroxylase DNA
probe, Harada et al. (1987) found an apparent absence of restriction
fragments corresponding to the 21-hydroxylase B gene. They found that
this apparent absence was not due to deletion of the gene but rather to
a conversion of the functional 21-hydroxylase B gene into the
nonfunctional 21-hydroxylase A pseudogene. In 2 patients studied, the
affected HLA haplotypes were different, suggesting that conversion had
occurred as independent events in the 2 instances. Harada et al. (1987)
suggested that gene conversion-like events may be a relatively common
cause of 21-hydroxylase deficiency in Japanese. They suggested that this
mechanism might also account in part for the predominance of congenital
adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency over that due to
deficiency of other steroidogenic P450 enzymes. There may be other
examples of gene conversion-like events that are responsible for
monogenic disorders when related homologous genes reside in tandem
array.

Baumgartner-Parzer et al. (2001) studied the mutational spectrum of
21-hydroxylase deficiency in 79 unrelated Austrian patients with classic
and nonclassic forms of CAH and their respective 112 family members.
Apparent large gene deletions/conversions were present in 31% of the 158
unrelated CAH alleles, whereas the most frequent point mutations were
intron 2 splice (613815.0006; 22.8%), I172N (613815.0001; 15.8%), V281L
(613815.0002; 12%), and P30L (613815.0004; 7.6%), in line with the
frequencies reported for other countries. Previously described mutations
were not present in 1.2% of unrelated CAH alleles, including those of
one female patient presenting with severe genital virilization. Sequence
analysis of the complete functional 21-hydroxylase gene revealed a novel
mutation in exon 10, arg426 to his (R426H; 613815.0026). In vitro
expression experiments showed that the R426H mutant exhibited only low
enzyme activity toward the natural substrate 17-hydroxyprogesterone.

Olney et al. (2002) developed an assay using real-time quantitative PCR
to detect deletions of CYP21A2. This assay was able to detect
heterozygous gene deletions with an alpha error rate of less than 5% and
with a power greater than 95%. When combined with allele-specific PCR,
genotyping for the 9 most common mutations could be completed within
hours of blood sampling. This technique was used to study subjects with
21-hydroxylase deficiency in north Florida. Twenty-eight subjects with
CAH, 7 first-degree relatives, and 13 normal subjects were
characterized. Of 96 chromosomes, 69 abnormal alleles were identified.
Among unrelated abnormal alleles, the frequency of specific mutations
was 28% for a gene deletion (613815.0011), 24% for the intron 2 splice
mutation, 10% for I172N, 8% each for V281L and the exon 6 cluster
(613815.0016), and 6% for gln318 to ter (Q318X; 613815.0020). These
frequencies, as well as the genotype/phenotype correlation, were similar
to those found in comparable populations.

Tukel et al. (2003) performed allele-specific PCR for the 8 most
frequently reported CYP21 point mutations in 31 Turkish families having
at least 1 21-hydroxylase-deficient individual. The allele frequencies
of the point mutations were as follows: P30L (613815.0004), 0%; IVS2
(613815.0006), 22.5%; G110-delta-8nt (613815.0015) , 3.2%; I172N
(613815.0001), 11.4%; exon 6 cluster (613815.0016), 3.2%; V281L
(613815.0002), 0%; Q318X (613815.0020), 8%; and R356W (613815.0003),
9.6%. Large deletions and gene conversions were detected by Southern
blot analysis, with allele frequencies of 9.6% and 22.5%, respectively.
Sequence analysis of CYP21, performed on patients with only 1 mutant
allele, revealed 2 missense mutations, R339H (613815.0021) and P453S
(613815.0010). A semiquantitative PCR/enzyme digestion-based method for
the detection of large-scale deletions/conversions of the gene was
developed for routine diagnostic purposes, and its accuracy was shown by
comparison with the results of Southern blot analysis.

To determine the mutational spectrum in the Tunisian CAH population,
Kharrat et al. (2004) analyzed the CYP21 active gene in 51 unrelated
patients using a strategy of digestion by restriction enzyme and
sequencing. All patients had a classical form of 21-hydroxylase
deficiency. Mutations were detected in over 94% of the chromosomes
examined. The most frequent mutation in the Tunisian CAH population was
Q318X (613815.0020), with large prevalence (35.3%), in contrast to the
0.5-13.8% described in other series. Incidence of other mutations did
not differ, as had been described: large deletions (e.g., 613815.0011)
(19.6%), mutation in intron 2 (613815.0006) (17.6%), and I172N
(613815.0001) (10.8%). Four novel mutations were found in 4 patients
with the salt-wasting form.

Sido et al. (2005) reported molecular analysis of 43 Romanian patients
with classical CAH, 38 with 21-hydroxylase deficiency and 5 with
11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency. The most frequent mutation in patients
with 21-hydroxylase deficiency was I2G (613815.0006) (43.9%), followed
by deletions and large conversions (16.7%). Genotypes were categorized
in 3 mutation groups according to their predicted functional
consequences and compared with clinical phenotype. Overall
genotype-phenotype correlation was 87.88%. In the 5 patients with
11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency, 3 homozygous mutations were identified.

- Origin of Mutations

Mornet et al. (1991) estimated that gene conversions involving small DNA
segments probably account for 74% of cases of 21-hydroxylase deficiency.
Complete deletion of the CYP21B gene (613815.0011) accounted for about
20% of cases of the classic form of the disease. Complete deletion of
CYP21B was associated with the salt-wasting form, as was an 8-bp
deletion in the third exon (613815.0015). A G-to-T transversion in the
seventh exon (613815.0002) was associated with the late-onset form of
the disease. Ghanem et al. (1990) concluded that about 70% of the
mutations in the CYP21B gene causing classic and nonclassic CAH are
point mutations, because the defective gene was indistinguishable from
its structurally intact corresponding gene in Southern blot analysis.
Due to the presence of a varying number of C4/21-hydroxylase repeat
units, this gene region varies in length among haplotypes. Haplotypes
carrying one C4/21-hydroxylase repeat unit with a CYP21P gene transmit
the severe form of 21-hydroxylase deficiency. Haglund-Stengler et al.
(1991) found association between triplication of the C4/21-hydroxylase
repeat unit and the mild form of 21-hydroxylase deficiency.

Gene conversion, a nonreciprocal exchange of homologous genetic
information, has been studied extensively in lower eukaryotes in which
all the products of a single meiosis can be recovered and analyzed.
Because the latter is not possible in mammals, nonreciprocality of the
genetic exchange cannot formally be demonstrated. Despite this
limitation, the designation 'gene conversion' has been applied to
exchanges observed in mammalian genomes that involve an alteration of an
allele at a specific locus in such a way as to suggest that an internal
portion of its sequence has been replaced by a homologous segment copied
from another allele or locus. Gaucher disease (230800) is another
example of a disorder in which conversion events occur between the
functional gene and a neighboring pseudogene. Gene conversion has been
postulated in other clustered gene families, including those for globins
(e.g., 142200), immunoglobulins (e.g., 147070), red-green visual
pigments (300822, 300821), and others. With the notable exception of the
HLA genes, in which many of the presumed gene conversion events involve
allelic exchanges, the postulated gene conversion events in the other
systems involve interlocus exchange. The evidence for gene conversion in
the human genome had been circumstantial until the description by
Collier et al. (1993) of a de novo mutation which permitted the direct
comparison of the 'converted' allele with its original form. They
observed the de novo introduction of a CYP21A pseudogene-specific
mutation into a CYP21B allele. Despite extensive investigations, not a
single mutant CYP21B allele has been reported to lack
pseudogene-specific mutations that are incompatible with normal gene
expression. Consequently, the pathogenesis of 21-hydroxylase deficiency
appears to be due almost exclusively to gene-pseudogene exchanges.
Tajima et al. (1993) concluded that approximately 90% of the genes in
patients with 21-hydroxylase deficiency are accounted for either by a
causative mutation from the pseudogene or by a deletion and suggested
that the remaining 10% may represent new mutations that do not exist in
the pseudogene. Tajima et al. (1993) described a de novo mutation of the
CYP21B gene causing CAH. HLA-identical affected and unaffected sibs were
observed. Both inherited a missense mutation in exon 4 from the father,
but only the affected sib received an intron 2 mutation that caused
aberrant RNA splicing from the mother, who was homozygous normal.

White et al. (1994) reviewed mutations in the CYP21 gene which are
responsible for more than 90% of cases of the inherited inability to
synthesize cortisol. Most of the mutations in CYP21 causing CAH are
generated by recombinations between CYP21 and CYP21P which either delete
CYP21 or transfer deleterious mutations from CYP21P to CYP21.

Miller (1988) discussed gene conversion in relation to the monogenic
form of adrenal hyperplasia. Higashi et al. (1988) presented evidence
for either unequal intragenic or intergenic recombination and/or gene
conversion events taking place between the pseudogene and the functional
gene.

In 4 steroid 21-hydroxylase B mutations from three
21-hydroxylase-deficient patients, Higashi et al. (1988) observed
several base changes as compared with the functional B gene. Many of
these base changes were identical to those in the CYP21A pseudogene. Two
of them were shown to have a point mutation in the second intron,
causing aberrant splicing. A third carried 3 clustered missense
mutations in the sixth exon, which impaired 21-hydroxylase activity.
Since all of these critical mutations could be seen in the corresponding
site of the CYP21A pseudogene, the data strongly suggested the
involvement of gene conversion in this genetic disease.

Using a genomic probe, Morel et al. (1989) defined 5 haplotypes that
identified the mutations in 57 families. Specifically, of 116
CAH-bearing chromosomes, 114 could be sorted into 1 of these 5
haplotypes, based on blots of DNA digested with TaqI and BglII.
Haplotype 1, present in 65.6%, was indistinguishable from the normal,
and therefore bore very small lesions, presumably point mutations.
Haplotype 2, present in 3.4%, and haplotype 3, present in 6.9%, had
deletions and duplications of the CYP21 pseudogene but had especially
intact functional genes, presumably bearing point mutations. Thus, point
mutation was the genetic defect in 75.9% of the chromosomes. Haplotypes
4 and 5, present in 11.2%, appeared to represent a gene that had
undergone a gene conversion event. Haplotype 5, present in 11.2%,
appeared to have a deletion of about 30 kb of DNA, resulting in a single
hybrid CYPA/B gene.

Donohoue et al. (1989) concluded that a single unequal crossing-over
between the CYP21A and CYP21B genes yields deletion of the latter active
gene to result in salt-losing CAH; furthermore, these crossovers do not
occur randomly within the complex. In a patient with 21-hydroxylase
deficiency, Sinnott et al. (1990) demonstrated a maternally inherited
haplotype that carried a de novo deletion of an approximately 30-kb
segment including the CYP21B gene and the associated C4B gene. The
disease haplotype appeared to have been generated through meiotic
unequal crossing-over. One of the maternal haplotypes was the frequently
occurring HLA-DR3,B8,A1 haplotype that normally carries a deletion of an
approximately 30-kb segment including the CYP21A gene and C4A gene.
Haplotypes of this type may act as premutations, increasing the
susceptibility to development of a 21-hydroxylase deficiency mutation by
facilitating unequal chromosome pairing. Mutations in the pseudogene
CYP21A include a C-to-T change that leads to a termination codon, TAG,
in the eighth exon. Urabe et al. (1990) found that same change in a
mutant CYP21B gene isolated from a patient with 21-hydroxylase
deficiency. Furthermore, a reciprocal change, i.e., a T-to-C change in
the eighth exon of the CYP21A gene, was observed in the Japanese
population. This was considered evidence for gene conversion.

Wu and Chung (1991) studied the effects of induced missense mutations at
cysteine-428, valine-281, and serine-268 of the 21-hydroxylase gene. A
ser268-to-thr mutation (613815.0005) had been found in a patient
suffering from CAH and a val281-to-leu mutation (613815.0002) was
identified in a patient with nonclassic CAH characterized by partial
enzyme deficiency. Cysteine-428 is the invariant cys among all
cytochrome P450s and is presumed to be the heme ligand. Wu and Chung
(1991) mutated ser268 to thr, cys, and met to see if these changes
altered the function of 21-hydroxylase. They changed val281 to leu, ile,
and thr, similarly, to study the effects on structure and function of
21-hydroxylase. Val, leu, and ile share properties; therefore,
substituting one with another should not drastically disturb the
structure of the protein. Wu and Chung (1991) changed cys428 to thr,
met, and ser to study the effects of these mutations. They found that
the cys428, val281, and ser268 mutations resulted in complete, partial,
or no loss of enzymatic activity, respectively. All the cys428 mutants
had neither enzymatic activity nor P450 absorption, thus supporting the
notion that cys428 is the heme ligand. All the 268-mutants exhibited the
same activity as normal 21-hydroxylase, demonstrating that the
clinically observed ser268-to-thr change represents a polymorphism
rather than the cause of enzyme deficiency.

Tusie-Luna and White (1995) pointed out that steroid 21-hydroxylase
deficiency is unusual among genetic diseases in that approximately 95%
of the mutant alleles have apparently been generated by recombination
between a normally active gene (CYP21) and a closely linked pseudogene
(CYP21P). Approximately 20% of mutant alleles carry DNA deletions of 30
kb that have presumably been generated by unequal meiotic crossing-over,
whereas 75% carry one or more mutations in CYP21 that are normally found
in the CYP21P pseudogene. These latter mutations are termed 'gene
conversions.' To assess the frequency at which these different
recombination events occur, Tusie-Luna and White (1995) used PCR to
detect de novo deletions and gene conversions in matched sperm and
peripheral blood leukocyte DNA samples from normal persons. Deletions
with breakpoints in a 100-bp region in intron 2 and exon 3 were detected
in sperm DNA samples with frequencies of approximately 1 in 10(5)-10(6)
genomes but were not detected in the matching leukocyte DNA. Gene
conversions in the same region occurred in approximately 1 in
10(3)-10(5) genomes in both sperm and leukocyte DNA. These data
suggested to the authors that whereas deletions occur exclusively in
meiosis, gene conversions occur during both meiosis and mitosis, or
perhaps only during mitosis. Thus, the authors concluded that gene
conversions must occur by a mechanism distinct from unequal
crossing-over.

Araujo et al. (2007) studied the CYP21A2 promoter/regulatory regions in
17 patients with the nonclassical form of 21-hydroxylase deficiency with
undetermined genotype and 50 controls. Promoter mutations were found in
compound heterozygosity with the V281L mutation in 1 patient and with
the I2 splice mutation in another. The authors concluded that
microconversions between CYP21A2 and CYP21A1P promoters could be
involved in the nonclassical form and that CYP21A2 promoter analysis
should be included in genetic studies of the disorder.

CYP21A2, the adjacent complement C4A gene, and parts of the flanking
genes serine/threonine protein kinase-19 (STK19; 604977) and tenascin-X
(TNXB; 600985) constitute a tandemly duplicated arrangement. The typical
number of repeats of the CYP21/C4 region is 2, with 1 repeat carrying
CYP21A2 and the other carrying the highly homologous pseudogene CYP21A1P
(see 613815.0012). Koppens et al. (2002) determined that apparent
large-scale conversions accounted for the defect in 9 of 77 chromosomes
in a group of patients with CAH due to steroid 21-hydroxylase
deficiency. They further showed that 4 of the 9 'conversions' extended
into the flanking TNXB gene. This implies that 1 in every 10 steroid
21-hydroxylase deficiency patients is a carrier of tenascin-X
deficiency, which is associated with a recessive form of the
Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (606408). Koppens et al. (2002) stated that data
on the structure of 'deletion' and 'large-scale conversion' chromosomes
strongly suggest that both are the result of the same mechanism, namely
unequal meiotic crossover.

Baumgartner-Parzer et al. (2007) identified 2 unrelated female patients
with CAH who inherited the intron 2 splice mutation (613815.0006) from
their father and harbored a de novo gene aberration on their maternal
haplotype, a large deletion in one and the I172N mutation (613815.0001)
in the other. Both mothers were found to be carriers of rare duplicated
CYP21A2 haplotypes, which were not detected in the daughters.
Baumgartner-Parzer et al. (2007) hypothesized that duplicated CYP21A2
genes could predispose for de novo mutations in offspring, which is
relevant for prenatal CYP21 genotyping and genetic counseling.

Lopez-Gutierrez et al. (1998) studied 47 Mexican families with
21-hydroxylase deficiency. In 9 families they failed to detect the
mutation found in the proband in either parent; paternity was
established in all cases. In 1 individual, paternal uniparental disomy
for 6p was established, and Lopez-Gutierrez et al. (1998) hypothesized
that germline mutations might explain the segregation pattern in the
remaining 8 families.

Corticosteroids have specific effects on cardiac structure and function
mediated by mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid receptors (MR and GR
(138040), respectively). Aldosterone and corticosterone are synthesized
in rat heart. To see whether they might also be synthesized in the human
cardiovascular system, Kayes-Wandover and White (2000) examined the
expression of genes for steroidogenic enzymes as well as genes for GR,
MR, and 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD11B2; 614232), which
maintains the specificity of MR. Human samples were from left and right
atria, left and right ventricles, aorta, apex, intraventricular septum,
and atrioventricular node, as well as whole adult and fetal heart. Using
RT-PCR, mRNAs encoding CYP11A, CYP21, CYP11B1 (610613), GR, MR, and
HSD11B2 were detected in all samples except ventricles, which did not
express CYP11B1. CYP11B2 (124080) mRNA was detected in the aorta and
fetal heart, but not in any region of the adult heart, and CYP17 was not
detected in any cardiac sample. Levels of steroidogenic enzyme gene
expression were typically 0.1% those in the adrenal gland. The authors
concluded that these findings are consistent with autocrine or paracrine
roles for corticosterone and deoxycorticosterone, but not cortisol or
aldosterone, in the normal adult human heart.

In each of 2 women with hyperandrogenism (see 201910), Lajic et al.
(2002) identified a novel missense mutation in the CYP21 gene
(613815.0031 and 613815.0032). The women were predicted to carry
mutations by hormonal evaluation, but did not display any of the
genotypes commonly associated with congenital adrenal hyperplasia. The
authors studied the functional and structural consequences of the
mutations, and their results emphasized the importance of genetic
evaluation and counseling in hyperandrogenic women who are predicted to
carry CAH-causing mutations by biochemical tests.

EVOLUTION

The CYP21 pseudogene has 3 main defects: an 8-bp deletion in exon 3, a T
insertion in exon 7, and a stop codon in exon 8. Kawaguchi et al. (1992)
demonstrated that the 8-bp deletion is present in the chimpanzee also,
whereas the other 2 defects are not found in the chimpanzee, gorilla, or
orangutan. In the gorilla and orangutan, however, extra CYP21 copies are
inactivated by other defects so that the number of functional copies is
reduced in each species. Comparison of the sequences revealed evidence
for intraspecific homogenization (concerted evolution) of the CYP21
genes, presumably through an expansion-contraction process effected by
relatively frequent unequal but homologous crossing-over.

Most mutations in the CYP21 gene causing congenital adrenal hyperplasia
(201910) are deletions. Amor et al. (1988) reported the cloning and
characterization of a nondeleted mutant CYP21B gene. Codon 172 of the
mutant gene was found to be changed from ATC, encoding isoleucine, to
AAC, encoding asparagine. This mutation (I172N) is normally present in
the CYP21A pseudogene, so that it may have been transferred to the
mutant CYP21B gene by gene conversion. Hybridization of oligonucleotide
probes corresponding to this and 2 other mutations normally present in
CYP21A demonstrated that 4 out of 20 patients carried the codon 172
mutation; in 1 of these patients, the mutation was present as part of a
larger gene conversion involving at least exons 3-6. Gene conversion may
be a frequent cause of 21-hydroxylase deficiency alleles due to the
presence of 6 chi-like sequences (GCTGGGG) in the CYP21 genes and the
close proximity of the CYP21A pseudogene, which has several potentially
deleterious mutations. Chiou et al. (1990) also found this mutation on 1
allele in a compound heterozygote. Partanen and Campbell (1991)
amplified the full-length genomic P450C21 gene by PCR. The ile172-to-asn
mutation in exon 4 was demonstrated. This mutation was observed also by
Wedell et al. (1992), who referred to it as ILE173ASN. Speiser et al.
(1992) found this mutation in 16% of 88 families with congenital adrenal
hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency. The mutation falls into
their group B with 2% enzyme activity and a simple virilizing phenotype.
Among 127 patients with 21-hydroxylase deficiency in Sweden, Wedell et
al. (1994) found that the ile173-to-asn mutation accounted for 20.8% of
186 unrelated chromosomes. (In the same study, the CYP21 gene was
completely absent in 29.8% of chromosomes, the val281-to-leu mutation
accounted for 5.4%, and the arg356-to-trp mutation accounted for 3.8%.
The most frequent nondeletional mutation was the splice mutation in
intron 2, which accounted for 27.7% of the chromosomes.) This mutation
is found in 28% of all the cases of simple virilizing type (White et
al., 1994). To clarify the molecular basis of nonclassic CAH detectable
by neonatal screening in Japan, Tajima et al. (1997) identified 2 sibs
and 2 unrelated newborns who were diagnosed with probable nonclassic
steroid 21-hydroxylase deficiency. The 2 sibs were found to have 1
allele that had 2 mutations, ile172 to asn and arg356 to trp.

In 9 patients with nonclassic 21-hydroxylase deficiency (201910)
associated with HLA-B14;DR1, Speiser et al. (1988) found a change in
codon 281 from GTG, encoding valine, to TTG, encoding leucine. Speiser
et al. (1989) concluded that this codon 281 mutation is a consistent
change in nonclassic 21-hydroxylase deficiency associated with
HLA-B14;DR1. The val281-to-leu mutation (V281L), found in association
with the HLA-B14;DR1 haplotype, accounts for 75 to 80% of nonclassic
21-hydroxylase deficiency (Mornet et al., 1991). This mutation was
observed in several patients by Wedell et al. (1992), who referred to it
as VAL282LEU.

In an analysis of steroid 21-hydroxylase gene mutations in the Spanish
population, Ezquieta et al. (1995) found that the most frequent mutation
causing the late onset form of disease (present in 15 of 38 patients)
was val281 to leu, found in 18 of 30 chromosomes (37%). This mutation is
found in 34% of all cases of the nonclassic type (White et al., 1994).

In samples from 2 patients (1 with a cortisol-producing adenoma and 1
with an androgen-secreting adrenocortical carcinoma), Beuschlein et al.
(1998) detected the heterozygous germline mutation val281 to leu in exon
7.

In a patient with simple virilizing CAH (201910) who was a compound
heterozygote for CYP21A2 mutations, Chiou et al. (1990) found a
CGG-to-TGG change in 1 allele resulting in substitution of a tryptophan
residue for arginine-356 (R356W). Mutants corresponding to this and the
ile172-to-asn (I172N; 613815.0001) allele were constructed from the
normal CYP21 cDNA by site-directed mutagenesis. Both mutations failed to
produce active enzyme. This mutation was also observed by Wedell et al.
(1992), who referred to it as ARG357TRP. Tajima et al. (1997) analyzed
CYP21 genes for nonclassic steroid 21-hydroxylase deficiency. The 4
patients tested (2 sibs and 2 unrelated newborns) carried the R356W
mutation.

NONCLASSIC TYPE
CYP21A2, PRO30LEU

The mild nonclassic form of steroid 21-hydroxylase deficiency (201910)
is one of the most common autosomal recessive disorders in humans,
occurring in almost 1% of Caucasians and about 3% of Ashkenazi Jews.
Many patients with this disorder carry a val281-to-leu (V281L) mutation
in the CYP21 gene. This and most other mutations causing 21-hydroxylase
deficiency are normally present in the CYP21P pseudogene and have
presumably been transferred to CYP21 by gene conversion. To identify
other potential nonclassic alleles, Tusie-Luna et al. (1991) used
recombinant vaccinia virus to express 2 mutant enzymes carrying the
mutations pro30 to leu (normally present in CYP21P) and ser268 to thr
(considered a normal polymorphism of CYP21; see 613815.0005). Whereas
the activity of the protein carrying the ser-to-thr mutation was indeed
indistinguishable from the wildtype, the enzyme with the pro-to-leu
substitution had 60% of the wildtype activity for 17-hydroxyprogesterone
and about 30% of normal activity for progesterone when assayed in intact
cells. Proline-30 is conserved in many microsomal P450 enzymes and may
be important for proper orientation of the enzyme with respect to the
amino-terminal transmembrane segment. The pro30-to-leu mutation was
present in 5 of 18 patients with nonclassic 21-hydroxylase deficiency.
Tajima et al. (1997) observed the P30L mutation in 1 allele in 3 of 4
patients (2 sibs and 2 unrelated newborns) with nonclassic CAH in Japan.

Rodrigues et al. (1987) identified a substitution of threonine for
serine-268 in 21-hydroxylase (S268T) in a patient with congenital
adrenal hyperplasia. Wu and Chung (1991) reported studies of induced
mutations changing ser268 to thr, cys, and met. All of these 268-mutants
exhibited the same activity as normal 21-hydroxylase, demonstrating that
the ser268-to-thr change clinically represents a polymorphism rather
than the cause of the enzyme deficiency.

ADRENAL HYPERPLASIA, CONGENITAL, DUE TO 21-HYDROXYLASE DEFICIENCY
CYP21A2, IVS2AS, A/C-G, -13

The most frequent nondeletional mutation found in patients with classic
congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency (201910)
is an A-to-G transition at position -2 in the acceptor splice site of
intron 2. As a result of the mutation, an aberrant splice acceptor site
is activated 7 bases upstream of the mutation (Higashi et al., 1988). As
pointed out by Miller (1996), this mutation, located in intron 2, is 13
bases (not 2) from the splice acceptor site of exon 3. According to the
nucleotide numbering system of Higashi et al. (1988), it is residue 655.
Miller (1996) noted that this base is normally polymorphic, being either
C or A with roughly equal frequency in the normal population. Either a
C-to-G or A-to-G mutation at nucleotide -13 causes the severe 21-OH
deficiency.

This mutation has been detected in patients affected with either the
salt-wasting or simple virilizing forms of the disorder (Owerbach et
al., 1990; Mornet et al., 1991). White et al. (1994) reported that this
mutation represents 22% of the salt-wasting cases, 25% of the simple
virilizing cases, and 12% of the nonclassic cases.

As reported by Hirschfeld and Fleshman (1969) and Pang et al. (1982),
the Yupik Eskimos of western Alaska have the world's highest prevalence
of HLA-linked classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to steroid
21-hydroxylase deficiency. The frequency was estimated to be between 1
in 282 and 1 in 490 liveborn infants. Studying 4 patients from 3
apparently unrelated Eskimo families residing in geographically distant
villages, Speiser et al. (1992) found that all were homozygous for a
substitution of G for A at base 656 in the second intron. They concluded
that allele-specific hybridization should be an efficient means of
prenatal diagnosis in this isolated population.

In the Spanish population, Ezquieta et al. (1995) found this splicing
mutation in 30% of 41 mutant chromosomes, making it the most frequent
cause of severe CAH in this population. They stated the mutation as an
A-to-G change at nucleotide 655 of their clone. During the course of
genetic analysis of CYP21 mutations in CAH families,

Day et al. (1996) noticed a number of relatives genotyped as nucleotide
656G homozygotes who showed no clinical signs of disease. They proposed
that the putative asymptomatic nucleotide 656G/G individuals are
incorrectly typed due to a dropout of 1 haplotype during PCR
amplification of CYP21. They recommended that for prenatal diagnosis,
microsatellite typing be used as a supplement to CYP21 genotyping in
order to resolve ambiguities at nucleotide 656.

Lee et al. (2003) noted that approximately 75% of defective CYP21 genes
that cause CAH are generated through intergenic recombination, termed
apparent gene conversion, from the neighboring CYP21P pseudogene. Among
them, the common intron 2 splice site mutation, which Lee et al. (2003)
designated IVS2-12A/C-G, is believed to be derived from this mechanism
and is the most prevalent case among all ethnic groups. However,
mutation of 707-714delGAGACTAC (613815.0015) rarely exists alone,
although this locus is 53 nucleotides away from IVS2-12A/C-G. From the
molecular characterization of the mutation of IVS2-12A/C-G combined with
707-714delGAGACTAC in patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia, Lee
et al. (2003) found that it appeared to be in a 3.2- rather than a
3.7-kb fragment generated by Taq I digestion in a PCR product of the
CYP21 gene. Interestingly, the 5-prime end region of such a CYP21
haplotype had CYP21P-specific sequences. The authors concluded that the
coexistence of these 2 mutations is caused by deletion of the CYP21P, XA
(TNXA; see 600985), RP2 (pseudogene of STK19, 604977), and C4B (120820)
genes and intergenic recombination in the C4-CYP21 repeat module.

Among 370 unrelated alleles from patients in the Netherlands with
21-hydroxylase deficiency, Stikkelbroeck et al. (2003) found this to be
the most common point mutation, occurring in 28.1% of alleles. They
referred to the mutation as I2G (IVS2-13A/C-G; 656A/C-G).

Wedell et al. (1992) developed selective PCR amplification and direct
sequencing of the full-length CYP21 gene and thereby identified 3
previously unknown mutations. One of them, in a patient with severe
steroid 21-hydroxylase deficiency (201910), represented a substitution
of serine for glycine-292 (G292S). The mutation was the result of a
G-to-A transition at nucleotide 1718 in exon 7. The patient was 1 of 20
hemizygous patients, i.e., patients with only 1 copy of the functional
CYP21 gene.

In 2 sibs with the late-onset form of 21-hydroxylase deficiency (201910)
manifested by pseudoprecocious puberty, growth acceleration, and
clitoral enlargement at ages 8 and 10 years, Wedell et al. (1992)
identified hemizygosity (i.e., only 1 functional CYP21 gene was present)
for 3 sequence changes: C to T at 4 bases upstream of translation
initiation, pro106 to leu, and pro454 to ser. Since pro454 is conserved
in 4 species, it is likely to be important for normal enzyme function.
(White et al. (1994) later referred to the pro106-to-leu substitution as
pro105 to leu, and Owerbach et al. (1992) referred to the pro454-to-ser
substitution as pro453 to ser.)

Nikoshkov et al. (1997) tested the function of the -4, pro105-to-leu,
and pro453-to-ser mutations by in vitro translation after expression of
the mutant enzymes in cultured cells. While the -4 substitution had no
measurable effect, the pro105-to-leu and pro453-to-ser mutations reduced
enzyme activity to 62% and 68% for 17-hydroxyprogesterone and 64% and
46% for progesterone, respectively. When present in combination, these 2
mutations caused a reduction of enzyme activity to 10% for
17-hydroxyprogesterone and 7% for progesterone. These results indicated
that pro105-to-leu and pro453-to-ser alleles should only cause very
subtle disease when not in combination but may be considered when
genotyping patients with the mildest forms of CAH1.

Using PCR in a study of the structure of the CYP21 gene in 13 unrelated
nonclassic steroid 21-hydroxylase deficiency (201910) patients, 3
affected sibs, and 55 blood donors, Owerbach et al. (1992) found the
val281-to-leu (613815.0002) and pro30-to-leu (613815.0004) mutations, as
well as a pro453-to-ser (P453S) mutation in exon 10. The P453S mutation
was identified in 46.2% of unrelated nonclassic CAH patients, but only
7.7% and 3.6% of salt-wasting CAH patients and blood donors,
respectively. In contrast to the other 2 'nonclassic' mutations, pro453
to ser had not been detected in the CYP21 pseudogene and, therefore,
probably had not arisen by gene conversion.

Soardi et al. (2008) found that P453S and another nonclassic mutation,
H62L (613815.0034), had a synergistic interaction. When the mutant
proteins were expressed together in COS cells, the activity of the
enzyme was reduced to 4.1% and 2.3% toward 17OHP and progesterone,
respectively. Two unrelated patients who both carried P453S+H62L on the
paternal allele had a mild simple virilizing phenotype.

In 13 patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (201910), White et
al. (1988) identified a deletion of approximately 30 kb, leaving behind
the C4A gene (encoding the fourth component of complement; 120820) and a
single CYP21P-like gene. The deletion prevents the synthesis of the
protein and destroys all enzymatic activity. This mutation is very

Higashi et al. (1988) discovered that the CYP21P genes in 11 patients
with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (201910) seemed to be replaced
frequently in their 3-prime portions by the CYP21 gene sequences. All of
these alterations occurred without changing the characteristic length
(3.2 kb) of the TaqI fragment of the CYP21P gene, a result strongly
suggesting that frequent gene conversions and/or intragenic
recombinations have happened in the P-450 (C21) genes. This mutation
results in a salt-wasting type and destroys all enzymatic activity. Gene
conversions were observed in 8 normal individuals, suggesting that the
resulting gene sequences do not always contain deleterious mutations
from the CYP21 pseudogene.

By hybridization with specific oligonucleotide probes, White et al.

causes the salt-wasting type of congenital adrenal hyperplasia. This
mutation is present in about 8% of the salt-wasting CAH (201910) cases.

In a patient with the salt-wasting form of congenital adrenal
hyperplasia caused by 21-hydroxylase deficiency (201910), Higashi et al.
(1988) identified a cluster mutation in exon 6 of the CYP21A2 gene
(ILE235ASN (I235N), VAL236GLU (V236E), and MET238LYS (M238K)). Each of
these substitutions was caused by a T-to-A transversion at nucleotide
position 1380, 1383, and 1389, respectively. This mutation was presumed
to have arisen in a gene conversion event.

Tusie-Luna et al. (1990) expressed the exon 6 cluster mutation at high
levels in cultured COS-1 cells using recombinant vaccinia virus to
determine its functional effect. They found that this mutation had no
detectable enzymatic activity.

Robins et al. (2005) excluded the M239K mutation as a disease-causing
mutation in this cluster by demonstrating that it has no effect on
enzyme activity. V237E abolished enzyme function and is thus a null
mutation, whereas very low but measurable activity remained for I236N.

Globerman et al. (1988) identified a T-to-C substitution at nucleotide
1994 in exon 8 of the CYP21A2 gene, resulting in a stop codon at
position 318 (Q318X). Individuals homozygous for this mutation have the
salt-wasting form of 21-hydroxylase deficiency (201910) and no enzymatic
activity. This mutation is normally present in the CYP21 pseudogene.

In a Spanish population, Ezquieta et al. (2002) provided data on the
contributions of gene conversion and founder effect to the distribution
of the 2 most frequent severe point mutations of the CYP21A2 gene
causing congenital adrenal hyperplasia: the 655G splicing mutation at
intron 2 (613815.0006) and gln318-to-ter. Both mechanisms were found to
contribute to the mutant alleles in different degrees. The 655G splicing
mutation (accounting for 15.5% of alleles) seemed to be almost
exclusively related to recent conversion events, whereas Q318X
(accounting for 8.3% of alleles) was more likely to be due to the
dissemination of remotely generated mutant alleles.

had not been identified in any pseudogenes, suggesting that the mutation

heterozygous state. They identified a heterozygous G-to-A transition at
nucleotide 2494, resulting in a gly424-to-ser (G424S) substitution in a
region where glycine is conserved in at least 4 species. Overall, the
gly424-to-ser mutation was found in a compound heterozygous state in 5
Brazilian families; 4 presented the simple virilizing form, and 1
presented the nonclassic form. Interestingly, 3 of the 5 families had a
mulatto origin. All patients with the gly424-to-ser mutation had CYP21P

large gene deletion of the CYP21B (paternal) and CYP21A (maternal)
genes. One of the 3 sisters had given birth to a daughter who was a
clinically asymptomatic carrier of the R426H mutation. In vitro
expression experiments showed the R426H mutant to exhibit only low
enzyme activity toward the natural substrate 17-hydroxyprogesterone.

ADRENAL HYPERPLASIA, CONGENITAL, DUE TO 21-HYDROXYLASE DEFICIENCY,
CLASSIC TYPE
CYP21A2, 1-BP INS, 82C

Genotyping of 41 Brazilian patients with the classical form of
21-hydroxylase deficiency revealed 64% microconversion, whereas
deletions and large gene conversions accounted for up to 21% of the
molecular defect (Araujo et al., 1996; Paulino et al., 1999). Lau et al.
(2001) reported a novel mutation disclosed by sequencing the entire
CYP21 gene of a patient in whom no pseudogene-originated mutation had
been found. The patient, who had the classical form of 21-hydroxylase
deficiency (201910), was the daughter of a consanguineous marriage; she
was homozygous for a novel frameshift, an insertion of a cytosine
between nucleotides 82 and 83, within exon 1. The mutation caused
conversion of codon 28 from histidine to proline and premature
termination at amino acid 78.

ADRENAL HYPERPLASIA, CONGENITAL, DUE TO 21-HYDROXYLASE DEFICIENCY,
CLASSIC TYPE
CYP21A2, IVS2, A-G, -2

In 3 unrelated Brazilian patients with the classic form of the
21-hydroxylase deficiency (201910), Billerbeck et al. (2002) found 3
novel mutations after CYP21 gene sequencing. In 1 patient and her
brother, both affected with the simple virilizing form, and in their
aunt, with the nonclassic form, an AG-to-GG transition was found in the
acceptor site of intron 2. In the sibs, this mutation was found in
compound heterozygosity with the I172N mutation (613815.0001); in their
aunt, it was found in compound heterozygosity with P30L (613815.0004),
which confers more than 30% enzyme activity, explaining why she
presented with the nonclassic form. In another patient with the
salt-wasting form, they found an insertion of an adenine between
nucleotides 1003 and 1004, in exon 4, that altered the reading frame and
created a stop codon at codon 297. In the third patient and his sister,
they found a C-to-T transition in codon 408 predicted to encode an
arg408-to-cys (R408C) substitution in a region where arginine is
conserved in at least 4 different species. Microsatellite studies, using
markers flanking CYP21 gene, revealed that each new mutation presents
the same haplotype, suggesting a gene founder effect for each one.

HYPERANDROGENISM, NONCLASSIC TYPE, DUE TO 21-HYDROXYLASE DEFICIENCY
CYP21A2, VAL304MET

In a woman with hyperandrogenism (201910), Lajic et al. (2002)
identified a novel homozygous val304-to-met (V304M) mutation in the
CYP21 gene. After expression in COS-1 cells, the mutated enzyme was
found to have a residual activity of 46% for conversion of
17-hydroxyprogesterone and 26% for conversion of progesterone compared
with the normal enzyme. A normal degradation pattern for this mutant
enzyme indicated that the mutation is of functional, rather than
structural, importance.

.0032
HYPERANDROGENISM, NONCLASSIC TYPE, DUE TO 21-HYDROXYLASE DEFICIENCY
CYP21A2, GLY375SER

In a woman with signs of hyperandrogenism (201910), Lajic et al. (2002)
identified a novel gly375-to-ser (G375S) mutation in the CYP21 gene in
heterozygous state with a pro453-to-ser (P453S; 613815.0010) mutation,
which is known to cause nonclassic CAH. The G375S variant almost
completely abolished enzyme activity; conversion was 1.6% and 0.7% of
normal for 17-hydroxyprogesterone and progesterone, respectively.

ADRENAL HYPERPLASIA, CONGENITAL, DUE TO 21-HYDROXYLASE DEFICIENCY
CYP21A2, VAL281LEU, PHE306+1, GLN318TER, AND ARG356TRP

Stikkelbroeck et al. (2003) found a clustering of pseudogene-derived
mutations in exons 7 and 8 of the CYP21A2 gene (val281 to leu, a 1-bp
insertion after codon 306, gln318 to ter, and arg356 to trp) in 7 of 370
unrelated alleles (1.9%) from a population of Dutch patients with
21-hydroxylase deficiency (201910). This cluster had been reported by
Koppens et al. (2000) in 2 Dutch patients (2 of 75 unrelated alleles)
and by Wilson et al. (1995) in 2 patients (2 of 394 alleles).
Stikkelbroeck et al. (2003) suggested that this cluster may be specific
to the Dutch population and may be attributable to a common founder.

.0034
ADRENAL HYPERPLASIA, CONGENITAL, DUE TO 21-HYDROXYLASE DEFICIENCY
CYP21A2, HIS62LEU

Of 60 novel mutations in CYP21 identified in a screen of 2,900 patients
with steroid 21-hydroxylase deficiency (201910), Menassa et al. (2008)
found that a his-to-leu substitution at codon 62 (H62L) was the most
frequent. The H62L substitution, which arises from an A-to-T
transversion at nucleotide 185 in exon 1 of the CYP21 gene, was found in
13 patients from 12 unrelated families, either isolated or associated on
the same allele with a mild mutation. In isolation, or when associated
with a partial conversion of the promoter, the H62L mutation was
responsible for a nonclassic form; associated with the P453S
(613815.0010) or P30L (613815.0004) mutations, H62L contributed to a
simple virilizing phenotype more severe than that associated with P453S
or P30L alone, but not as severe as the phenotype associated with I172N
(613815.0001). Analysis of a 3-dimensional model structure of the CYP21
protein localized the H62L mutation to the beta-1-sheet region, in a
large hydrophobic area considered important for membrane anchoring.

Soardi et al. (2008) found that the H62L mutant protein showed an
activity compatible with a nonclassic mutation in functional assays.
Determination of apparent kinetic constants revealed that the substrate
binding capacity was in the same magnitude for mutant and normal enzyme.
Soardi et al. (2008) found that the H62L mutation was associated with
other mutations in both Brazilian and Scandinavian patients. In the
Scandinavian patients H62L was associated on the paternal allele with
the nonclassical P453S (613815.0010) mutation. In vitro activity data
revealed a synergistic effect of the H62L+P453S mutation, which may
explain the mild simple virilizing phenotype in these patients.

.0035
ADRENAL HYPERPLASIA, CONGENITAL, DUE TO 21-HYDROXYLASE DEFICIENCY
CYP21A2, LYS121GLN

In a female patient with nonclassical 21-hydroxylase deficiency
(201910), Riepe et al. (2008) detected heterozygosity for a novel
mutation in the CYP21A2 gene, a 364A-C transversion in exon 3 resulting
in a lys121-to-gln substitution (K121Q). This mutation was present on
the maternal allele; the paternal allele carried a P453S mutation
(613815.0010). In vitro expression analysis of the mutant K121Q enzyme
in transiently transfected COS-7 cells revealed reduced CYP21 activity
of approximately 14.0% for the conversion of 17-hydroxyprogesterone and
19.5% for the conversion of progesterone. K121 is located on helix C in
the CYP21 protein, which is part of the heme coordinating system. In
addition, helix C is involved in the interaction with the
electron-providing enzyme P450 oxidoreductase (124015). Riepe et al.
(2008) hypothesized that the K121Q mutation impairs electron flux
between P450 oxidoreductase and CYP21 and alters substrate affinity by
displacing the heme coordination site.
