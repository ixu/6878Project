VAULT RNA COMPONENT 2; VAULTRC2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Vaults are large cytoplasmic ribonucleoproteins composed largely of MVP
(605088) and a nontranslated vault RNA component. By PCR of a human
genomic DNA library, Kickhoefer et al. (1998) cloned 3 vault RNA genes,
HVG1 (VTRNA1-1; 612695), HVG2 (VTRNA1-2), and HVG3 (VTRNA1-3; 612697).
Both HVG2 and HVG3 contain 86 bases and have an internal RNA polymerase
III (see 606007)-type promoter element and a typical polymerase III
termination signal. They both have an internal 10-base deletion compared
with HVG1.

Kickhoefer et al. (1999) found that only HVG1 was expressed in all human
cell lines examined. When expressed, HVG2 and HVG3 were often associated
with the supernatant fraction rather than microsomal pellets containing
vaults.

Nandy et al. (2009) described the structure of VTRNA1-2. The
88-nucleotide RNA forms an extended stem-loop structure with asymmetric
internal bulges. It contains characteristic internal polymerase III
A-box and B-box promoter elements and a downstream B2-box motif. Size
exclusion chromatography of fractionated HeLa cells, followed by
Northern and Western blot analyses, detected about 5% of the VTRNA1-1
and VTRNA1-2 content eluting with MVP, while 95% remained in the
supernatant.

GENE FUNCTION

Kickhoefer et al. (1998) found that HVG1, but not HVG2 or HVG3,
associated with vaults in human cell lines.

Nandy et al. (2009) found that expression of VTRNA1-1, VTRNA1-2,
VTRNA1-3, and CBL3 (VTRNA2-1; 614938) was upregulated in cord blood
lymphocytes infected with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Upregulation was
highest for VTRNA1-1 (about 1,100-fold) and lowest for CBL3 (about
3-fold). Expression of VTRNA1-1, VTRNA1-2, and CBL3 was also upregulated
by the EBV-related Kaposi sarcoma virus, but not by members of other
virus families.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kickhoefer et al. (2003) determined that the upstream region of the
VTRNA1-2 gene contains a TATA-like element, a consensus proximal
sequence, and a cAMP response element.

MAPPING

Kickhoefer et al. (2003) stated that the VTRNA1-1, VTRNA1-2, and
VTRNA1-3 genes map to a 16-kb region of chromosome 5.

Nandy et al. (2009) stated that the VTRNA1-2 gene is located near the
PCDHA gene cluster (604966), which Wu and Maniatis (1999) mapped to
chromosome 5q31.

209901	TITLE *209901 BBS1 GENE; BBS1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

BBS1 is 1 of 7 BBS proteins that form the stable core of a protein
complex required for ciliogenesis (Nachury et al., 2007).

CLONING

By positional cloning, Mykytyn et al. (2002) identified the gene that is
mutant in Bardet-Biedl syndrome-1 (see 209900). It was selected for
further examination because its encodes protein with modest similarity
to the BBS2 protein (606151). The gene consists of 3,370 bp with an open
reading frame of 593 codons. By Northern blot analysis, Mykytyn et al.
(2002) demonstrated that BBS1 was ubiquitously expressed, including
expression in fetal tissues, testis, retina, and adipose tissue. The
pattern of expression was similar to those seen for BBS2, BBS4 (600374),
and BBS6 (MKKS; 604896).

GENE STRUCTURE

Mykytyn et al. (2002) found that the BBS1 gene contains 17 exons and
spans approximately 23 kb. Mykytyn et al. (2003) showed that the BBS1
gene is highly conserved between mouse and human.

MAPPING

Mykytyn et al. (2002) identified the BBS1 gene within the critical
region defined for Bardet-Biedl syndrome-1 on chromosome 11q34.

Based on genomic sequence analysis, Sheffield (2003) assigned the mouse
Bbs1 gene to chromosome 19.

GENE FUNCTION

Nachury et al. (2007) found that BBS1, BBS2 (606151), BBS4 (600374),
BBS5 (603650), BBS7 (607590), BBS8 (TTC8; 608132), and BBS9 (607968)
copurified in stoichiometric amounts from human retinal pigment
epithelium (RPE) cells and from mouse testis. PCM1 (600299) and
alpha-tubulin (see 602529)/beta-tubulin (191130) copurified in
substoichiometric amounts. The apparent molecular mass of the complex,
which Nachury et al. (2007) called the BBSome, was 438 kD, and it had a
sedimentation coefficient of 14S. The complex localized with PCM1 to
nonmembranous centriolar satellites in the cytoplasm and, in the absence
of PCM1, to the ciliary membrane. Cotransfection and immunoprecipitation
experiments suggested that BBS9 was the complex-organizing subunit and
that BBS5 mediated binding to phospholipids, predominantly
phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate. BBS1 mediated interaction with RABIN8
(RAB3IP; 608686), the guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the small G
protein RAB8 (RAB8A; 165040). Nachury et al. (2007) found that RAB8
promoted ciliary membrane growth through fusion of exocytic vesicles to
the base of the ciliary membrane. They concluded that BBS proteins
likely function in membrane trafficking to the primary cilium.

Loktev et al. (2008) found that BBIP10 (613605) copurified and
cosedimented with the BBS protein complex from RPE cells. Knockdown of
BBIP10 in RPE cells via small interfering RNA compromised assembly of
the BBS protein complex and caused failure of ciliogenesis. Knockdown of
BBS1, BBS5, or PCM1 resulted in a similar failure of ciliogenesis in RPE
cells. Depletion of BBIP10 or BBS8 increased the frequency of centrosome
splitting in interphase cells. BBIP10 also had roles in cytoplasmic
microtubule stabilization and acetylation that appeared to be
independent of its role in assembly of the BBS protein complex.

Using a protein pull-down assay with homogenized bovine retina, Jin et
al. (2010) showed that ARL6 (608845) bound the BBS protein complex.
Depletion of ARL6 in human RPE cells did not affect assembly of the
complex, but it blocked its localization to cilia. Targeting of ARL6 and
the protein complex to cilia required GTP binding by ARL6, but not ARL6
GTPase activity. When in the GTP-bound form, the N-terminal amphipathic
helix of ARL6 bound brain lipid liposomes and recruited the BBS protein
complex. Upon recruitment, the complex appeared to polymerize into an
electron-dense planar coat, and it functioned in lateral transport of
test cargo proteins to ciliary membranes.

Ishizuka et al. (2011) reported that phosphorylation of DISC1 (605210)
acts as a molecular switch from maintaining proliferation of mitotic
progenitor cells to activating migration of postmitotic neurons in mice.
Unphosphorylated DISC1 regulates canonical Wnt signaling via an
interaction with GSK3-beta (605004), whereas specific phosphorylation at
serine-710 triggers the recruitment of Bardet-Biedl syndrome (see
209900) proteins to the centrosome. In support of this model, loss of
BBS1 (209901) leads to defects in migration, but not proliferation,
whereas DISC1 knockdown leads to deficits in both. A phospho-dead mutant
can only rescue proliferation, whereas a phospho-mimic mutant rescues
exclusively migration defects. Ishizuka et al. (2011) concluded that
their data highlight a dual role for DISC1 in corticogenesis and
indicate that phosphorylation of this protein at serine-710 activates a
key developmental switch.

By mass spectrometric analysis of transgenic mouse testis, Seo et al.
(2011) found that Lxtfl1 (606568) copurified with human BBS4 and with
the core mouse BBS complex subunits Bbs1, Bbs2, Bbs5, Bbs7, Bbs8, and
Bbs9. Immunohistochemical analysis of human RPE cells showed
colocalization of LXTFL1 and BBS9 in cytoplasmic punctae. Use of small
interfering RNA revealed distinct functions for each BBS subunit in BBS
complex assembly and trafficking. LZTFL1 depletion and overexpression
studies showed a negative role for LZTFL1 in BBS complex trafficking,
but no effect of LZTFL1 on BBS complex assembly. Mutation analysis
revealed that the C-terminal half of Lztfl1 interacted with with the
C-terminal domain of Bbs9 and that the N-terminal half of Lztfl1
negatively regulated BBS complex trafficking. Depletion of several BBS
subunits and LZTFL1 also altered Hedgehog (SHH; 600725) signaling, as
measured by GLI1 (GLI; 165220) expression and ciliary trafficking of SMO
(SMOH; 601500).

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Using computational analysis, Jin et al. (2010) found that the BBS
protein complex shares structural features with the canonical coat
complexes COPI (601924), COPII (see 610511), and clathrin AP1 (see
603531). BBS4 and BBS8 consist almost entirely of tetratricopeptide
repeats (TPRs) (13 and 12.5 TPRs, respectively), which are predicted to
fold into extended rod-shaped alpha solenoids. BBS1, BBS2, BBS7, and
BBS9 each have an N-terminal beta-propeller fold followed by an
amphipathic helical linker and a gamma-adaptin (AP1G1; 603533) ear
motif. In BBS2, BBS7, and BBS9, the ear motif is followed by an
alpha/beta platform domain and an alpha helix. In BBS1, a 4-helix bundle
is inserted between the second and third blades of the beta propeller.
BBS5 contains 2 pleckstrin (PLEK; 173570) homology domains and a 3-helix
bundle, while BBIP10 consists of 2 alpha helices. Jin et al. (2010)
concluded that the abundance of beta propellers, alpha solenoids, and
appendage domains inside the BBS protein complex suggests that it shares
an evolutionary relationship with canonical coat complexes.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Mykytyn et al. (2002) sequenced the BBS1 gene in the probands from 6
families (5 of Puerto Rican and 1 of Turkish ancestry) showing linkage
to the BBS1 region on chromosome 11. In a consanguineous Puerto Rican
family, they found a homozygous G-to-T transversion in exon 16 that
results in a nonsense mutation, glu549 to ter (E549X; 209901.0002). In a
second consanguineous Puerto Rican family, they found a homozygous
T-to-G transversion in exon 12, predicted to result in a nonconservative
substitution from methionine to arginine at codon 390 (M390R;
209901.0001). Two additional Puerto Rican families were compound
heterozygotes with respect to the E549X and M390R mutations. Analysis of
a fifth Puerto Rican revealed the presence of a heterozygous E549X
mutation and a heterozygous G-to-A transition at the +1 position of the
splice donor site in exon 4 (432+1G-A; 209901.0003). Affected
individuals in the consanguineous Turkish family showed a homozygous
deletion of 1 bp in exon 10, resulting in a premature termination at
codon 288 (tyr284fsX288; 209901.0004). In an evaluation of 60 unrelated
North American probands with BBS of mostly northern European ancestry
for the presence of the 4 mutations identified in the extended families,
using single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis, Mykytyn
et al. (2002) identified 22 individuals who had at least 1 copy of the
M390R mutation. Of these 22 individuals, 16 were homozygous with respect
to this variant (allele frequency = 0.32). A sequence variant was not
detected in 192 control chromosomes from individuals of mostly northern
European ancestry.

Mykytyn et al. (2002) found that in their families with BBS1 the
disorder segregated as an autosomal recessive disease, with no evidence
of involvement of the common M390R mutation in triallelic inheritance.
See the INHERITANCE section of 209900 for a full discussion. Badano et
al. (2003) found heterozygous mutation in BBS1 (209901.0006) and
homozygous mutation in BBS7 (607590.0002) in affected individuals,
raising the possibility that BBS7 may interact genetically with other
loci to produce the BBS phenotype.

Beales et al. (2003) presented a comprehensive analysis of the spectrum,
distribution, and involvement in nonmendelian trait transmission of
mutant alleles in BBS1, the most common BBS locus. Analyses of 259
independent families segregating a BBS phenotype indicated that BBS1
participates in complex inheritance and that, in different families,
mutations in BBS1 can interact genetically with mutations at each of the
other known BBS genes, as well as genes at unknown loci, to cause the
phenotype. Consistent with this model, they identified homozygous M390R
alleles (209901.0001), the most frequent BBS1 mutation, in asymptomatic
individuals in 2 families. Moreover, their statistical analyses
indicated that the prevalence of the M390R allele in the general
population is consistent with an oligogenic rather than a recessive
model of disease transmission. Although all BBS alleles appeared to be
capable of interacting genetically with each other, some genes,
especially BBS2 and BBS6, are more likely to participate in triallelic
inheritance, suggesting a variable ability of the BBS proteins to
interact genetically with each other.

Mykytyn et al. (2003) evaluated the involvement of the BBS1 gene in a
cohort of 129 probands with BBS and reported 10 novel BBS1 mutations,
including a leu518-to-pro (L518P; 209901.0005) mutation.

ANIMAL MODEL

Davis et al. (2007) generated a knockin mouse model of the BBS1 M390R
mutation. Mice homozygous for M390R recapitulated aspects of the human
phenotype, including retinal degeneration, male infertility, and
obesity. Morphologic evaluation of Bbs1 mutant brain revealed
ventriculomegaly of the lateral and third ventricles, thinning of the
cerebral cortex, and reduced volume of the corpus striatum and
hippocampus. Ultrastructural examination of the ependymal cell cilia
that lined the enlarged third ventricle of Bbs1 mutant brains showed
that, whereas the 9+2 arrangement of axonemal microtubules was intact,
elongated cilia and cilia with abnormally swollen distal ends were
present. Davis et al. (2007) concluded that the M390R mutation does not
affect axonemal structure, but it may play a role in regulation of cilia
assembly and/or function.

Using mice lacking Bbs2, Bbs4, or Bbs6 and mice with the M390R mutation
in Bbs1, Shah et al. (2008) showed that expression of BBS proteins was
not required for ciliogenesis, but their loss caused structural defects
in a fraction of cilia covering airway epithelia. The most common
abnormality was bulges filled with vesicles near the tips of cilia, and
this same misshapen appearance was present in airway cilia from all
mutant mouse strains. Cilia of Bbs4-null and Bbs1 mutant mice beat at a
lower frequency than wildtype cilia. Neither airway hyperresponsiveness
nor inflammation increased in Bbs2- or Bbs4-null mice immunized with
ovalbumin compared with wildtype mice. Instead, mutant animals were
partially protected from airway hyperresponsiveness.

By immunostaining for axonemal proteins, Tan et al. (2007) demonstrated
that mouse dorsal root ganglion neurons contain cilia. Bbs1-null and
Bbs4-null mice demonstrated behavioral deficits in thermosensation and
mechanosensation associated with alterations in the trafficking of the
thermosensory channel Trpv1 (602076) and the mechanosensory channel
Stoml3 (608327) within sensory neurons. The findings were replicated in
C. elegans lacking Bbs7 or Bbs8 (TTC8; 608132). Detailed examination of
9 patients with BBS showed a noticeable decrease in peripheral sensation
in most of them.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
BARDET-BIEDL SYNDROME 1
BBS1, MET390ARG

Mykytyn et al. (2002) identified a met390-to-arg (M390R) mutation in the
BBS1 gene in affected members of a consanguineous Puerto Rican family
with Bardet-Biedl syndrome (209900). The substitution results from a
T-to-G transversion at nucleotide 1169 (1169T-G) in exon 12 (Mykytyn,
2002). Two other Puerto Rican families carried this mutation and the
glu549-to-ter mutation (209901.0002) in compound heterozygosity. Mykytyn
et al. (2002) found the M390R mutation in 22 of 60 unrelated North
American probands with Bardet-Biedl syndrome of mostly northern European
ancestry. Sixteen of the 22 individuals were homozygous for the variant
(allele frequency = 0.32).

Mykytyn et al. (2003) found that the M390R mutation accounts for
approximately 80% of all BBS1 mutations and is found on a similar
genetic background across populations.

Beales et al. (2003) identified homozygous M390R alleles in asymptomatic
individuals in 2 separate families. They interpreted this as consistent
with an oligogenic rather than a recessive model of disease
transmission, as seen in triallelic inheritance.

Fan et al. (2004) reported the cases of 2 sisters homozygous for the
M390R mutation. One sister, who was also heterozygous for a G169A
mutation in the BBS3 gene (600151.0002), was more severely affected than
the sister without the additional mutation, suggesting a modifying
effect of the mutation in BBS3.

.0002
BARDET-BIEDL SYNDROME 1
BBS1, GLU549TER

In a consanguineous Puerto Rican family with Bardet-Biedl syndrome
(209900), Mykytyn et al. (2002) found a homozygous G-to-T transversion
at nucleotide 1655 (1655G-T) in exon 16 of the BBS1 gene that resulted
in a glu549-to-ter (E549X) nonsense mutation.

.0003
BARDET-BIEDL SYNDROME 1
BBS1, IVS4, G-A, +1

In a Puerto Rican family with Bardet-Biedl syndrome (209900), Mykytyn et
al. (2002) found a heterozygous G-to-A transition at the +1 position of
the splice donor site in exon 4 of the BBS1 gene (432+1G-A). Affected
individuals were compound heterozygous for the E549X mutation
(209901.0002).

.0004
BARDET-BIEDL SYNDROME 1
BBS1, 1-BP DEL, 851A

In a consanguineous Turkish family with Bardet-Biedl syndrome (209900),
Mykytyn et al. (2002) found a homozygous deletion of 1 bp in exon 10 of
the BBS1 gene (851delA), resulting in premature termination at codon 288
(tyr284fsX288).

.0005
BARDET-BIEDL SYNDROME 1
BBS1, LEU518PRO

One of 10 novel mutations in the BBS1 gene reported by Mykytyn et al.
(2003) was a 1553T-C transition in exon 15 of the cDNA, resulting in a
leu518-to-pro (L518P) change. It was detected in 3 patients with
Bardet-Biedl syndrome (209900), all in combination with the M390R
mutation (209901.0001), and in none of 96 control subjects.

.0006
BARDET-BIEDL SYNDROME 7
BBS1, GLU234LYS

In a family with Bardet-Biedl syndrome (209900), Badano et al. (2003)
found a heterozygous glu234-to-lys (E234K) mutation in the BBS1 gene in
all 3 affected members. These individuals were also homozygous for a
thr211-to-ile (T211I) amino acid substitution in the BBS7 gene
(607590.0002), raising the possibility that the BBS1 and BBS7 loci
interact. Since none of the unaffected sibs was homozygous for the
defect in BBS7, it was considered equally likely that the third mutant
allele (in BBS1) is either required for pathogenesis of the BBS7
phenotype or modifies the phenotype.

.0007
BARDET-BIEDL SYNDROME 1
BBS1, 1-BP DEL, 1650C

In 2 sisters with BBS1 (209900), Badano et al. (2003) identified
compound heterozygosity for mutations in the BBS1 gene: a 1-bp deletion
in exon 16, 1650delC, resulting in a frameshift at codon 548 and a
premature stop at codon 579, and met390-to-arg (M390R; 209901.0001). The
more severely affected sister was heterozygous for a thr325-to-pro
substitution in the MKKS gene (T325P; 604896.0014).

;;WDR15;;
KIAA1351;;
BROMODOMAIN- AND WD REPEAT-CONTAINING PROTEIN 2, FORMERLY; BRWD2,
FORMERLY
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

WDR11 is a member of the WD repeat-containing protein family. For
background information on this family, see 604734.

CLONING

Allelic deletions in 10q25-q26 and 19q13.3-q13.4 are common genetic
alterations in glial tumors. Chernova et al. (2001) identified a
balanced t(10;19) reciprocal translocation in a glioblastoma cell line
that involved both critical regions on chromosomes 10 and 19. By
positional cloning of the translocation breakpoint, they identified a
novel WD-repeat gene on chromosome 10, which they designated WDR11.
WDR11 encodes a deduced 1,224-amino acid polypeptide with a calculated
molecular mass of 137 kD. It contains 6 putative WD40 repeats, a
predicted transmembrane region, and a tyrosine kinase phosphorylation
site. Northern blot analysis detected ubiquitous expression of 3 major
transcripts (4.5, 2.7 and 2.0 kb) in all tissues tested. Chernova et al.
(2001) determined that the translocation resulted in deletion of exon 5
and fusion of intron 4 of WDR11 to the 3-prime untranslated region of
ZNF320 (606427), a novel member of the Kruppel-like zinc finger gene
family on chromosome 19. Since ZNF320 is oriented toward the centromere
of chromosome 19, both genes appeared on the same derivative chromosome,
der(10). The chimeric transcript encodes an aberrant WDR11 polypeptide,
which is truncated after the second of the 6 WD repeats. Because of the
localization of WDR11 in a region frequently showing loss of
heterozygosity in glioblastoma (see DMBT1; 601969) and because WDR11 is
inactivated in glioblastoma cells, Chernova et al. (2001) considered
WDR11 to be a candidate tumor suppressor gene involved in tumorigenesis
of glial and other tumors.

To investigate developmental expression of Wdr11, Kim et al. (2010)
performed whole-mount in situ hybridization analysis in mouse embryos
from days E10.5 to E14.5. As early as E10.5, the entire developing
central nervous system, except for the spinal cord, revealed Wdr11
expression. The neuroepithelium, including the diencephalic region that
gives rise to hypothalamic neurons where GnRH (152760) neurons reside,
stained strongly for Wdr11 at E11.5 and E12.5. At E14.5, high levels of
Wdr11 expression were particularly noteworthy in the developing cortex
and olfactory bulb. In the adult brain, intense Wdr11 expression was
restricted to the olfactory bulb, the olfaction-related piriform cortex,
the granule cell layer of the cerebellum, and neurons of the hippocampal
formation. Kim et al. (2010) noted that the pattern of expression was
consistent with a role for WDR11 in both normosmic and anosmic forms of
hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.

GENE STRUCTURE

Chernova et al. (2001) determined that the WDR11 gene contains 29 exons
distributed over 58 kb and is oriented towards the telomere.

MAPPING

By positional cloning, Chernova et al. (2001) mapped the WDR11 gene to
chromosome 10q26.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen, Kim et al. (2010) identified EMX1
(600034) as a WDR11 binding partner. The interaction was confirmed in
mammalian cells by coimmunoprecipitation assays and further confirmed by
GST pull-down analysis. Kim et al. (2010) generated WDR11 deletion
mutants and performed GST pull-down assays to assess binding, which
demonstrated that both the N terminus and the central portion of WDR11
bind to EMX1, whereas the C terminus does not. Immunostaining in a
physiologically relevant human cell system consisting of immortalized
human embryonic olfactory GnRH neuroblasts isolated from olfactory
epithelium of an 8- to 12-week-old human embryo (FCNB4-hTERT cells)
localized WDR11 to the cytoplasm. Fluorescence microscopy of transfected
U2OS cells also showed a cytoplasmic localization for WDR11, whereas
EMX1 localized to the nucleus. However, after treatment with leptomycin
B, an inhibitor of nuclear export, both EMX1 and WDR11 colocalized in
the nucleus, suggesting that WDR11 might be shuttling between nucleus
and cytoplasm.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Kim et al. (2010) screened 201 normosmic and hyposmic/anosmic patients
with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH14; 614858) for mutations in the
candidate gene WDR11 (606417) and identified 5 different heterozygous
missense mutations in 6 unrelated probands, including 5 normosmic
patients (see, e.g., 606417.0001 and 606417.0002) and 1 anosmic patient
(606417.0003). DNA from the parents was unavailable, but the mutations
were not found in more than 400 controls.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM 14 WITHOUT ANOSMIA
WDR11, PHE1150LEU

In a man with incomplete hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and an unrelated
woman with complete HH, both of whom were normosmic (HH14; 614858), Kim
et al. (2010) identified heterozygosity for a 3450T-G transversion in
exon 28 of the WDR11 gene, resulting in a phe1150-to-leu (F1150L)
substitution at a highly conserved residue near the C terminus. The
mutation was not found in 420 white controls. Haplotype analysis
indicated a shared haplotype around WDR11, suggesting that the 2
patients were likely to be descended from a recent common ancestor.

.0002
HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM 14 WITHOUT ANOSMIA
WDR11, ALA435THR

In a Turkish man with complete hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, who had
bilateral cryptorchidism and a normal sense of smell (HH14; 614858), Kim
et al. (2010) identified heterozygosity for a 1303G-A transition in exon
10 of the WDR11 gene, resulting in an ala435-to-thr (A435T) substitution
at a highly conserved residue within the sixth WD domain. Transfection
studies in HEK293 cells demonstrated that the A435T mutation abolishes
EMX1 (600034) binding. The mutation was not found in 402 Turkish
controls or 426 white controls.

.0003
HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM 14 WITH ANOSMIA
WDR11, HIS690GLN

In a man with anosmic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH14; 614858), Kim
et al. (2010) identified heterozygosity for a 2070T-A transversion in
exon 16 of the WDR11 gene, resulting in a his690-to-gln (H690Q)
substitution at a highly conserved residue within the ninth WD domain.
Transfection studies in HEK293 cells demonstrated that the H690Q
mutation abolishes EMX1 (600034) binding. The mutation was not found in
420 white controls.

612605	TITLE *612605 LATE CORNIFIED ENVELOPE 1C; LCE1C
;;LATE ENVELOPE PROTEIN 3; LEP3
DESCRIPTION For background information on the LCE gene cluster, see 612603.

CLONING

By database analysis to identify human orthologs of mouse genes encoding
late envelope proteins (LEPs), Marshall et al. (2001) identified LCE1C,
which they called LEP3.

Using real-time PCR, Jackson et al. (2005) detected high LCE1C
expression in human fetal, arm, penal, and abdominal skin. Expression
was much lower in vulva and was not detected in tongue and esophagus.

GENE FUNCTION

Jackson et al. (2005) showed that expression of LCE1 genes, including
LCE1C, was upregulated in cultured normal human keratinocytes by
ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, but not by calcium. Induction of LCE1C
could be detected 24 hours after UV irradiation and was very high 36
hours after UV irradiation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Jackson et al. (2005) determined that the LCE1C gene contains 2 exons.
Exon 1 is noncoding.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Marshall et al. (2001) mapped the LCE1C
gene within the LCE gene cluster on chromosome 1q21. Jackson et al.
(2005) stated that the mouse Lce1c gene maps to a syntenic LCE gene
cluster on chromosome 3F1.

600267	TITLE *600267 PROTEIN-TYROSINE PHOSPHATASE, NONRECEPTOR-TYPE, 13; PTPN13
;;PROTEIN-TYROSINE PHOSPHATASE PTPL1;;
FAS-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN-TYROSINE PHOSPHATASE 1; FAP1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a PCR-based approach, Saras et al. (1994) cloned a cytoplasmic
protein tyrosine phosphatase of nonreceptor type, which they designated
PTPL1. Overlapping cDNA clones encompassed an open reading frame of
7,398 bp, predicting a 2,466-amino acid protein with a molecular mass of
275 kD. PTPL1 was found to have a wide tissue distribution, a 9.5-kb
transcript being expressed in most tissues. PTPL1 has a protein-tyrosine
phosphatase domain located in the C terminus. In the nonenzymatic part
of PTPL1, 3 different structural motifs were identified; 2 of these are
often found in proteins at the interface between the plasma membrane and
the cytoskeleton, namely, a domain with similarity to the band 4.1
(130500) superfamily, and a region consisting of 5 copies of an 80-amino
acid repeat found in a variety of cytoskeleton-associated proteins. In
addition, PTPL1 has a leucine zipper motif. Saras et al. (1994) noted
that PTPL1 was the largest known PTP and the only one known to contain a
leucine zipper motif. Its structure suggests that it may be able to form
dimers and may localize to the submembranous cytoskeleton.

Both Banville et al. (1994) and Maekawa et al. (1994) isolated the same
nonreceptor-type protein-tyrosine phosphatase, PTPN13, which they
referred to as hPTP1E and PTP-BAS, respectively. Maekawa et al. (1994)
originally isolated a PCR product from basophil mRNA using degenerate
primers and RT-PCR. This was used as a probe to screen a
basophil-enriched KU812E cell cDNA library. The fully characterized cDNA
was over 8.1 kb and encoded a 2,485-amino acid predicted reading frame.
The Banville et al. (1994) cDNA was isolated by screening a ZR-75-1
breast carcinoma cell line at low stringency with a probe for LAR cDNA
(179590). The cDNA they identified was over 8.3 kb long and encoded a
2,490-amino acid reading frame. Both groups noted that the N-terminal
region contains motifs showing similarity to the GLGF motifs found in
guanylate kinase proteins that may play a role in the subcellular
distribution of these proteins within specialized structures of the cell
membrane where cell-cell interactions occur. Maekawa et al. (1994)
presented evidence for alternative splicing producing at least 3
different isoforms of PTPN13. Banville et al. (1994) expressed the
protein in E. coli and showed that the recombinant protein had the
expected protein-tyrosine phosphatase activity. Northern blot analysis
showed expression in a variety of tissues with especially high levels in
the kidney, lung, and fetal brain.

PTPN13 binds to a negative regulatory domain in Fas that inhibits
Fas-induced apoptosis; it has therefore also been called Fas-associated
protein-tyrosine-1 (FAP1) (Inazawa et al., 1996).

GENE STRUCTURE

Yoshida et al. (2002) determined that the PTPN13 gene is located only
633 bp upstream from JNK3 (602897) in a head-to-head orientation. A
short G/C-rich region between the cap sites of the 2 genes suggested
that they might share a bidirectional promoter region that appears to
contain multiple cis elements. They found that the PTPN13 gene, which
contains 48 exons, initiates transcription within exon 2 and terminates
in exon 48.

MAPPING

Banville et al. (1994) assigned the PTPN13 gene to chromosome 11 by PCR
of somatic cell hybrid DNAs. In an erratum, they stated that the gene
had been assigned to chromosome 4 and not 11 as reported.

Inazawa et al. (1996) localized the PTPN13 gene to 4q21.3 by both
fluorescence in situ hybridization and PCR analysis of somatic cell
hybrids. They noted that the 4q21.3 chromosomal region contains a gene
for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (173910) and is
frequently deleted in liver and ovarian cancers.

The assignment to 4q21 was confirmed by van den Maagdenberg et al.
(1996) who also mapped the gene to mouse chromosome 5.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Wang et al. (2004) performed a mutational analysis of the tyrosine
phosphatase gene superfamily in human cancers and identified 83 somatic
mutations in 6 protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPRF, 179590; PTPRG,
176886; PTPRT, 608712; PTPN3, 176877; PTPN13; and PTPN14, 603155),
affecting 26% of colorectal cancers and a smaller fraction of lung,
breast, and gastric cancers. Fifteen mutations were nonsense,
frameshift, or splice site alterations predicted to result in truncated
proteins lacking phosphatase activity. Wang et al. (2004) biochemically
examined 5 missense mutations in PTPRT, the most commonly altered
protein-tyrosine phosphatase, and found that they reduced phosphatase
activity. Expression of wildtype but not a mutant PTPRT in human cancer
cells inhibited cell growth. Wang et al. (2004) concluded that their
observations suggested that the mutated tyrosine phosphatases are tumor
suppressor genes, regulating cellular pathways that may be amenable to
therapeutic intervention.

607376	TITLE *607376 DYNACTIN 2; DCTN2
;;DYNAMITIN;;
DYNACTIN COMPLEX, 50-KD SUBUNIT; DCTN50
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

DCTN2 is a 50-kD subunit of dynactin, a multiprotein complex associated
with dynein. Cytoplasmic dynein is a molecular motor responsible for
minus-end-directed movement along microtubules. See DCTN1 (601143) and
DNCH1 (600112) for additional information about the dynactin complex and
dynein.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the DCTN2
gene to chromosome 12 (TMAP RH70660).

ANIMAL MODEL

LaMonte et al. (2002) generated a mouse model of amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis (ALS; 105400) by overexpressing dynamitin in postnatal motor
neurons of transgenic mice. They found that dynamitin overexpression
disrupted the dynein-dynactin complex, resulting in an inhibition of
retrograde axonal transport. The authors observed a late-onset, slowly
progressive motor neuron degenerative disease in the transgenic mice and
concluded that their mouse model confirms the critical role of disrupted
axonal transport in the pathogenesis of motor neuron degenerative
disease.

137780	TITLE *137780 GLIAL FIBRILLARY ACIDIC PROTEIN; GFAP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Glial fibrillary acidic protein is an intermediate-filament (IF) protein
that is highly specific for cells of astroglial lineage. Reeves et al.
(1989) isolated a cDNA encoding GFAP and determined its nucleotide
sequence. The predicted amino acid sequence indicated that GFAP shares
structural similarities--particularly in the central rod domain and to a
lesser degree in the carboxyl-terminal domain--with other IF proteins
found in nonepithelial cell types. Considerable sequence divergence in
the amino-terminal region of GFAP suggested that the tissue-specific
functions of this IF protein may be mediated through this region of the
molecule. GFAP is a useful marker of astroglia in the brain.

Using PS1 (104311) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen, Nielsen et al.
(2002) cloned a splice variant of GFAP, which they called GFAP-epsilon,
from a fetal brain cDNA library. GFAP-epsilon contains 42 amino acids
encoded by exon 7a at its C terminus in place of the 43-amino acid C
terminus encoded by exons 8 and 9 of GFAP-alpha, the originally
identified GFAP transcript.

MAPPING

Bernier et al. (1988) used cDNA probes to determine the chromosomal
location of the GFAP gene in the mouse by following its segregation in a
panel of interspecies somatic cell hybrids. Furthermore, they defined
RFLPs associated with the gene. Patterns of inheritance of these RFLPs
in recombinant inbred strains of mice showed that GFAP is encoded by a
single genetic locus on mouse chromosome 11. The murine gene is in close
proximity to the genes encoding p53 and myeloperoxidase. By Southern
blot hybridization of somatic cell hybrids and by in situ hybridization,
Bongcam-Rudloff et al. (1991) mapped the GFAP gene to human 17q21.
Brownell et al. (1991) also assigned the GFAP gene to chromosome 17 by
screening a mouse/human somatic cell hybrid panel with a GFAP cDNA
fragment.

GENE FUNCTION

Using binding assays with recombinant proteins, Nielsen et al. (2002)
determined that the unique C terminus of the GFAP-epsilon splice variant
was required for interaction with PS1, as were the coiled-coil 2 and
linker 1-2 regions shared with GFAP-alpha. GFAP-alpha did not interact
with PS1. Yeast 2-hybrid analysis of point mutations introduced into PS1
indicated that 2 nonconservative amino acid substitutions abolished
interaction with GFAP-epsilon, but 2 conservative substitutions, both
associated with Alzheimer disease, did not effect GFAP-epsilon binding.
By transfection in human embryonic kidney cells and in mouse
neuroblastoma cells, Nielsen et al. (2002)found that GFAP-epsilon
associated with intermediate filaments and perfectly colocalized with
GFAP-alpha, suggesting that both isoforms are polymerized into the same
filamentous structures. A subpopulation of GFAP-epsilon also colocalized
with PS1 in the perinuclear region and in cytoplasmic granules.

Radomska et al. (2013) stated that 3 major GFAP splice variants,
GFAP-alpha, -delta, and -kappa, are present in human central nervous
system. They found that GFAP-alpha was the dominant GFAP variant in
primary cultured human astrocytes. Knockdown of the RNA-binding protein
QKI (609590), predominantly the QKI7 variant, reduced astrocyte content
of GFAP-alpha mRNA. Treatment of astrocytes with the antipsychotic drug
haloperidol increased the expression of both QKI7 and GFAP-alpha.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Alexander disease (203450) is a rare disorder of the central nervous
system. Infants with Alexander disease develop a leukoencephalopathy
with macrocephaly, seizures, and psychomotor retardation, leading to
death usually within the first decade; patients with juvenile or adult
forms typically experience ataxia, bulbar signs and spasticity, and a
more slowly progressive course. The pathologic hallmark of all forms of
Alexander disease is the presence of Rosenthal fibers, cytoplasmic
inclusions in astrocytes that contain the intermediate filament protein
GFAP in association with small heat-shock proteins. By sequence analysis
of DNA from patients representing different Alexander disease
phenotypes, Brenner et al. (2001) found that most cases were associated
with nonconservative mutations in the coding region of the GFAP gene.
Alexander disease, therefore, represents the first example of a primary
genetic disorder of astrocytes, one of the major cell types in the
vertebrate CNS. Each mutation identified in the GFAP gene was
heterozygous, suggesting a dominant mutation. Because parental DNA was
normal in all instances where it was available, the authors concluded
that most cases of Alexander disease result from de novo mutations. It
was noteworthy that mutations in only 4 codons accounted for Alexander
disease in 10 of 11 patients, and these were all arginine codons.
Arginine codons are recognized as particularly prone to mutation,
presumably due to methylation of the CpG dinucleotide. Brenner et al.
(2001) suggested that the GFAP mutations in Alexander disease most
likely act in a dominant gain-of-function manner, as the phenotype of
Gfap-null mice is subtle and does not resemble Alexander disease. They
pointed out that the results do not exclude the possibility that defects
in other genes may be responsible for some cases of Alexander disease.
For example, Schuelke et al. (1999) reported a child with a phenotype
resembling Alexander disease (but without pathologic confirmation) who
was homozygous for a mutation in the NDUFV1 gene (161015.0003).

Rodriguez et al. (2001) searched for GFAP mutations in a series of
patients who had heterogeneous clinical symptoms but were candidates for
Alexander disease on the basis of suggestive neuroimaging abnormalities.
De novo heterozygous missense GFAP mutations were found in exon 1 or
exon 4 in 14 of the 15 patients analyzed, including patients without
macrocephaly. Nine patients carried arginine mutations that had been
described elsewhere: 4 had arg239 to cys (137780.0001); 1 had arg239 to
his (137780.0002); and 1 had arg79 to his (137780.0004). The other 5
patients had 1 of 4 novel mutations, of which 2 affected arginine and 2
affected nonarginine residues. All mutations were located in the rod
domain of GFAP, and there was a correlation between clinical severity
and the affected amino acid.

Li et al. (2005) identified mutations in the GFAP gene in 41 patients
with Alexander disease. They stated that a total of 42 different GFAP
mutations had been identified, and almost all mutations resulted in a
gain-of-function dominant effect. There was a suggestion of male
predominance of the disorder.

Li et al. (2006) determined that the paternal chromosome carried the
GFAP mutation in 24 of 28 unrelated cases of Alexander disease analyzed,
suggesting that most mutations occur during spermatogenesis rather than
in the embryo. No effect of paternal age was observed.

In 13 unrelated Italian patients with Alexander disease, including 8
with the infantile, 2 with the juvenile, and 3 with the adult form,
Caroli et al. (2007) identified 11 different mutations in the GFAP gene
(see, e.g., 137780.0005), including 4 novel mutations. Ten mutations
occurred in the rod domains and 1 in the tail domain.

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

Rodriguez et al. (2001) could discern a genotype-phenotype correlation
for the 2 most frequently mutated arginine residues, R79 (8 patients)
and R239 (10 patients), with the phenotype of the R79 mutations
appearing much less severe than that of the R239 mutations. The 4
patients they found with R79 mutations appeared to be the least severely
affected: none developed macrocephaly, 3 achieved independent walking,
and, at the time of report, all were alive at ages 2.5 to 20 years.
Similarly, among the 4 patients with R79 mutations who were reported by
Brenner et al. (2001), 2 lived until the ages of 14 and 48 years, the
other 2 were still alive, at ages 7 and 8 years, at the time of report
by Rodriguez et al. (2001). Patients with R239 mutations, reported by
both Brenner et al. (2001) and Rodriguez et al. (2001), had marked
impairment of psychomotor development, and some had progressive
macrocephaly.

Gorospe et al. (2002) reported 12 genetically confirmed cases of
Alexander disease caused by 9 heterozygous point mutations in the GFAP
gene. The cases demonstrated variable ages of onset and symptoms. The
authors stated that no clear-cut genotype-phenotype correlations were
apparent.

ANIMAL MODEL

Messing et al. (1998) found that overexpression of human GFAP in
astrocytes of transgenic mice was fatal and was accompanied by the
presence of inclusion bodies indistinguishable from human Rosenthal
fibers, the pathologic hallmark of all forms of Alexander disease. These
results suggested that a primary alteration in the GFAP gene may be
responsible for Alexander disease.

Gomi et al. (1995), Pekny et al. (1995), Shibuki et al. (1996), and
Liedtke et al. (1996) independently reported generation of
GFAP-deficient mice. In all cases, the mutant mice are normal at birth
and develop grossly normal. Using immunohistochemical analysis, Pekny et
al. (1995) concluded that GFAP knockout mice are lacking intermediate
filaments in astrocytes of the hippocampus and in the white matter of
the spinal cord. Using microscopic analysis of brain sections, Liedtke
et al. (1996) observed a mutant phenotype characterized by abnormal
myelination, alterations in the blood-brain barrier, disorganization of
white matter architecture and vascularization, and hydrocephalus in
older mice associated with loss of white matter. They concluded that
GFAP is necessary for the long-term maintenance of normal CNS
myelination. Shibuki et al. (1996) observed that long-term depression at
parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapses is deficient in GFAP knockout
mice. Furthermore, GFAP mutant mice exhibited a significant impairment
of eyeblink conditioning without any detectable deficits in motor
coordination tasks. They concluded that GFAP may be required for
communications between Bergmann glia and Purkinje cells during long-term
depression induction and maintenance.

Hagemann et al. (2005) performed gene expression analysis on olfactory
bulbs of transgenic mice overexpressing wildtype human GFAP at 2
different ages. Expression profiles revealed a stress response that
included genes involved in glutathione metabolism, peroxide
detoxification, and iron homeostasis. Many of these genes are regulated
by the transcription factor Nfe2l2 (600492), which is also increased in
expression at 3 weeks. An immune-related response occurred with
activation of cytokine and cytokine receptor genes, complement
components, and acute phase response genes. These transcripts were
further elevated with age, with additional induction of
macrophage-specific markers, such as Mac1 (ITGAM; 120980) and CD68
(153634), suggesting activation of microglia. At 4 months, decreased
expression of genes for microtubule-associated proteins, vesicular
trafficking proteins, and neurotransmitter receptors became apparent.
Interneuron-specific transcription factors, including Dlx family members
and Pax6 (607108), were downregulated as well as Gad1 (605363) and Gad2
(138275), suggesting impairment of GABAergic granule cells. Hagemann et
al. (2005) proposed a mechanism wherein an initial stress response by
astrocytes results in the activation of microglia and compromised
neuronal function.

Hagemann et al. (2009) noted that Rosenthal fibers in the complex
astrocytic inclusions characteristic of Alexander disease contain GFAP,
vimentin (VIM; 193060), plectin (PLEC1; 601282), ubiquitin (UBB;
191339), HSP27 (HSPB1; 602195), and alpha-B-crystallin (CRYAB; 123590).
CRYAB regulates GFAP assembly, and elevation of CRYAB is a consistent
feature of Alexander disease; however, its role in Rosenthal fibers and
disease pathology is not known. In a mouse model of Alexander disease,
Hagemann et al. (2009) showed that loss of Cryab resulted in increased
mortality, whereas elevation of Cryab rescued animals from terminal
seizures. When mice with Rosenthal fibers induced by overexpression of
GFAP were crossed into a Cryab-null background, over half died at 1
month of age. Restoration of Cryab expression through the GFAP promoter
reversed this outcome, showing the effect was astrocyte-specific.
Conversely, in mice carrying an Alexander disease-associated mutation
and in mice overexpressing wildtype GFAP, which, despite natural
induction of Cryab also died at 1 month, transgenic overexpression of
Cryab resulted in a markedly reduced CNS stress response, restored
expression of the glutamate transporter Glt1 (SLC1A2; 600300), and
protected these animals from death.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
ALEXANDER DISEASE
GFAP, ARG239CYS

Brenner et al. (2001) found that 5 unrelated patients with Alexander
disease (203450) were heterozygous for mutations in codon 239 of the
GFAP gene. In 4 of these, a C-to-T transition at nucleotide 729 led to
an arg239-to-cys mutation (R239C). Age at death in these 4 patients
varied from 4 years to 11 years. The fifth patient had an arg239-to-his
mutation (137780.0002). DNA was normal in the parents where available.

In a 1-year-old female with typical features of Alexander disease,
Shiroma et al. (2001) identified the frequent R239C missense mutation.
The patient was born of nonconsanguineous parents. Early developmental
milestones were normal, but at the age of 1 year she had the first
febrile seizure, and after 2 weeks she had status epilepticus with
fever. Thereafter, she lost the ability to stand with help and to speak
words. Examination showed increased head circumference (+2.3 SD) and
good social response. Plantar responses were bilaterally extensor. In
addition to the typical manifestations of macrocephaly, psychomotor
retardation, spasticity, and seizures, the radiologic findings were
typical of Alexander disease.

Rodriguez et al. (2001) found the arg239-to-cys mutation in heterozygous
state in 4 of 14 patients with infantile Alexander disease. One of the
patients was 18 months old at the time of onset, underwent deterioration
of psychomotor development at the age of 6 years, had a head
circumference of 1.5 standard deviations above the mean, and was alive
at age 8 years.

Li et al. (2005) reported 2 unrelated patients with juvenile-onset
Alexander disease who were heterozygous for the R239C mutation. One
patient had onset at age 2 years and the other at age 4 years.

.0002
ALEXANDER DISEASE
GFAP, ARG239HIS

In a patient with Alexander disease (203450), Brenner et al. (2001)
identified a G-to-A transition at nucleotide 730 of the GFAP gene,
causing an arg239-to-his substitution. This infant died at the age of 11
months. Four other patients had an arg239-to-cys mutation; see
137780.0001.

Li et al. (2005) reported 5 unrelated patients with Alexander disease
resulting from the R239H mutation. All patients had a severe form of the
disease, with onset by age 6 months and death by age 5 years.

.0003
ALEXANDER DISEASE
GFAP, ARG416TRP

In 2 unrelated patients with Alexander disease (203450) that led to
death at ages 7 and 8, respectively, Brenner et al. (2001) identified a
C-to-T transition at nucleotide 1260 of the GFAP gene, resulting in an
arg416-to-trp substitution.

Li et al. (2005) noted that the R416W mutation had been identified in
patients with infantile-, juvenile-, and adult-onset Alexander disease.

A pathologic hallmark of Alexander disease is the abundance of protein
aggregates in astrocytes. These aggregates, termed Rosenthal fibers,
contain the protein chaperones alpha-B crystallin (123590) and HSP27
(602195) as well as GFAP. Perng et al. (2006) showed that the R416W
mutation in GFAP significantly perturbs in vitro filament assembly. The
filamentous structures formed resemble assembly intermediates but
aggregated more strongly. Consistent with the heterozygosity of the
mutation, this effect was dominant over wildtype GFAP in coassembly
experiments. Transient transfection studies demonstrated that R416W GFAP
induces the formation of GFAP-containing cytoplasmic aggregates in a
wide range of different cell types, including astrocytes. Monoclonal
antibodies specific for R146W GFAP revealed, for the first time for any
intermediate filament-based disease, the presence of the mutant protein
in the characteristic histopathologic features of the disease, namely,
Rosenthal fibers. The data confirmed that the effects of the R416W GFAP
are dominant, changing the assembly process in a way that encourages
aberrant filament-filament interactions that then lead to protein
aggregation and chaperone sequestration as early events in Alexander
disease.

.0004
ALEXANDER DISEASE
GFAP, ARG79HIS

In a patient with Alexander disease (203450) with onset at age 10 years
and death at age 48 years, Brenner et al. (2001) identified a G-to-A
transition at nucleotide 250 of the GFAP gene, leading to an
arg79-to-his substitution. Brenner et al. (2001) found the same mutation
in a patient with Alexander disease still living at the age of 8 years.

.0005
ALEXANDER DISEASE
GFAP, ARG79CYS

In a patient with Alexander disease (203450) with onset at 3 months and
death at 14 years, Brenner et al. (2001) identified a C-to-T transition
at nucleotide 249 of the GFAP gene, leading to an arg79-to-cys (R79C)
substitution. Brenner et al. (2001) found the same mutation in a patient
with Alexander disease still living at the age of 7 years.

Caroli et al. (2007) identified the R79C mutation in 3 unrelated Italian
boys with Alexander disease. All had onset before age 10 months. One of
the patients died at age 19 years.

.0006
ALEXANDER DISEASE
GFAP, ARG88CYS

In 2 unrelated patients with Alexander disease (203450), Rodriguez et
al. (2001) found an arg88-to-cys (R88C) mutation in the GFAP gene.

.0007
ALEXANDER DISEASE
GFAP, ARG88SER

In a patient with Alexander disease (203450), Rodriguez et al. (2001)
found an arg88-to-ser (R88S) missense mutation in heterozygous state in
the GFAP gene.

.0008
ALEXANDER DISEASE
GFAP, LEU76PHE

In a patient with Alexander disease (203450), Rodriguez et al. (2001)
found a leu76-to-phe (L76F) heterozygous missense mutation in the GFAP
gene.

.0009
ALEXANDER DISEASE
GFAP, ASN77TYR

In a patient with Alexander disease (203450), Rodriguez et al. (2001)
found a de novo, heterozygous missense mutation, asn77-to-tyr (N77Y), in
the GFAP gene.

.0010
ALEXANDER DISEASE
GFAP, GLU362ASP

In a patient with juvenile-onset Alexander disease (203450), Sawaishi et
al. (2002) identified a homozygous 1100G-C transition in the GFAP gene,
resulting in a glu362-to-asp substitution. A brother and the parents did
not carry the mutation. The mutation occurred in the C-terminal end of
the central rod domain, a highly conserved region of GFAP and other
types of intermediate filaments (e.g., vimentin (193060), desmin
(125660), keratin-1 (139350)).

.0011
ALEXANDER DISEASE
GFAP, ARG276LEU

In 2 Japanese brothers with Alexander disease (203450), Namekawa et al.
(2002) described an 841G-T transition at nucleotide 841, resulting in an
arg276-to-leu (R276L) substitution. Both brothers had spastic paresis
without palatal myoclonus, and MRI showed marked atrophy of the medulla
oblongata and cervicothoracic cord. The autopsy showed severely involved
shrunken pyramids but scarce Rosenthal fibers. Moderate numbers of
Rosenthal fibers were observed in the stratum subcallosum and
hippocampal fimbria. One patient was well until age 33; the second
brother developed regressive spastic gait at the age of 48 years and
gradually noticed that he could not raise his left arm. The parents were
nonconsanguineous and both died in their eighth decade without apparent
evidence of a neurologic disorder. They had only the 2 offspring, both
of whom had no children. The R276L mutation was heterozygous in both
brothers. Assuming accurate attribution of paternity, one might suggest
that this represented an example of parental gonadal mosaicism.

.0012
ALEXANDER DISEASE
GFAP, LEU352PRO

In a patient with a severe form of infantile Alexander disease (203450),
Bassuk et al. (2003) identified a heterozygous 1055T-C transition in the
GFAP gene, resulting in a leu352-to-pro (L352P) substitution. Residue
352 is a highly conserved amino acid that is found in all intermediate
filament proteins and across species.

.0013
ALEXANDER DISEASE
GFAP, ASP78GLU

In a family with an autosomal dominant adult form of Alexander disease
(203450), Stumpf et al. (2003) identified a heterozygous C-to-A change
in exon 1 of the GFAP gene, resulting in an asp78-to-glu (D78E)
substitution. Amino acid 78 lies in the rod domain of the protein. The
clinical phenotype varied in severity, but the pattern of evolution was
similar in all affected members. Although sleep disturbances and
dysautonomia, primarily constipation, began in childhood, the major
neurologic features began in the third or fourth decade of life. MRI of
the older patients showed atrophy of the medulla without signal
abnormalities.

601589	TITLE *601589 RAS p21 PROTEIN ACTIVATOR 2; RASA2
;;GTPase-ACTIVATING PROTEIN OF RAS; GAP1M
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Maekawa et al. (1994) isolated a mammalian GTPase-activating protein of
RAS from rat (GAP1M) that shows sequence similarity to the suppressor of
RAS (see 190020) function in Drosophila, known as Gap1 (Gaul et al.,
1992). Expression was relatively high in brain, placenta, and kidney but
lower in other tissues. A recombinantly expressed protein containing the
GAP-related domain was shown to stimulate GTPase activity of RAS.

Li et al. (1996) isolated the human homolog of rat GAP1M from a brain
cDNA library. The deduced 853-amino acid protein is 89.4% identical to
the rat protein.

MAPPING

Using a panel of somatic cell hybrid DNAs, Li et al. (1996) mapped the
human GAP1M gene to chromosome 3. By fluroescence in situ hybridization,
they mapped GAP1M to 3q22-q23.

;;SPRY DOMAIN-CONTAINING SOCS BOX PROTEIN 3; SSB3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database analysis, Wang et al. (2005) identified SPSB3, which they
called SSB3. The deduced 348-amino acid protein shares 16% amino acid
identity with SPSB1 (611657) and has a long N-terminal extension. SPSB3
contains a central SPRY domain and a C-terminal SOCS box.
Coimmunoprecipitation studies showed that SPSB3 interacted with MET
(164860).

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the SPSB3
gene to chromosome 16 (TMAP RH103022).

600694	TITLE *600694 INTERLEUKIN 6 SIGNAL TRANSDUCER; IL6ST
;;GP130 TRANSDUCER CHAIN; GP130
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Initially described as the interleukin-6 signal transducer, gp130 is a
transducer chain shared by many cytokines, including IL6 (147620), IL11
(147681), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF; 159540), oncostatin M (OSM;
165095), and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF; 118945), as reviewed by
Kishimoto et al. (1994). All of these cytokines act via a bi- or
tripartite receptor complex in which signaling is triggered by
homodimerization (IL6) or heterodimerization with LIF-Rb/gp190 protein
(IL11, LIF, OSM, and CNTF) of gp130. These cytokines thus mediate
similar biologic activities in various tissues. See also IL6RA (147880).

CLONING

By immunoscreening a placenta cDNA expression library with antibodies to
human gp130, followed by screening a myeloma cell line cDNA library,
Hibi et al. (1990) cloned gp130. The deduced 918-amino acid protein has
an N-terminal signal peptide, followed by a 597-amino acid extracellular
region, a transmembrane domain, and a 277-amino acid cytoplasmic domain.
It also contains 14 potential N-glycosylation sites. The mature
896-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 101 kD. Part
of the extracellular region, including 4 conserved cysteines and a WSxWS
motif, shows significant homology with cytokine receptors. Gp130 is most
closely related to GCSFR (CSF3R; 138971). Both receptors contain 6
fibronectin (135600) type III modules in the extracellular region. The
intracellular domain has a consensus nucleotide-binding domain, but it
has no protein kinase catalytic domain. Four sequences in the
intracellular domain are similar to GTP-binding motifs of RAS
(190020)-related proteins. Northern blot analysis detected a 7.0-kb
transcript in all cell lines examined. Gp130 showed an apparent
molecular mass of 130 kD by SDS-PAGE.

Saito et al. (1992) cloned mouse gp130. The deduced 917-amino acid
protein has a domain structure equivalent to that of human gp130,
including 4 conserved cysteines and the 4 GTP-binding motif-like
sequences. Mouse and human gp130 share 76.8% amino acid homology,
including 100% identity in a 116-amino acid stretch that spans the
transmembrane domain. Northern blot analysis detected 7.0- and 10.0-kb
transcripts expressed in varying ratios in all tissues examined. Lowest
expression was in spleen. During mouse embryonic development, robust
expression of both gp130 transcripts was detected on day 6, and
expression peaked on day 8.

Narazaki et al. (1993) purified 2 soluble forms of gp130 (sgp130) from
human serum. These proteins had apparent molecular masses of 90 and 110
kD.

Diamant et al. (1997) cloned sgp130 from a peripheral blood mononuclear
cell cDNA library. The deduced protein contains 624 amino acids. Diamant
et al. (1997) determined that the sgp130 transcript results from
alternative splicing and includes an 85-bp exon just before the
transmembrane-coding exon. This insertion results in a frameshift, and
the sequence following the insertion encodes 4 amino acids not found in
full-length membrane-bound gp130, followed by a stop codon 1 bp from the
transmembrane-coding region. PCR analysis detected expression of sgp130
in all myeloma cell lines tested except 1 line growing independent of
IL6 stimulation. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells transfected with
sgp130 secreted the protein into the medium. Some sgp130 was also
secreted by CHO cells transfected with cDNA encoding full-length gp130,
but at a much lower concentration. Diamant et al. (1997) concluded that
sgp130 could be generated both by shedding and by expressing an
alternatively spliced transcript.

GENE FUNCTION

Hibi et al. (1990) determined that cells transfected with IL6RA
expressed mainly low-affinity IL6-binding sites. Cotransfection of gp130
cDNA increased the number of high-affinity binding sites, but gp130 did
not directly bind IL6 or several other cytokines. Mouse IL3
(147740)-dependent pre-B cells proliferated when cultured with IL6 plus
soluble IL6RA only following transfection with human gp130. Hibi et al.
(1990) concluded that gp130 is involved in the formation of
high-affinity IL6-binding sites and in IL6 signal transduction.

Murakami et al. (1991) analyzed C-terminal truncation mutants of gp130.
Mutants retaining only the last 10 amino acids of the 277-amino acid
C-terminal region proximal to the transmembrane domain were capable of
binding the IL6/IL6R complex; however, these mutants were unable to
transduce the growth signal following IL6/IL6R complex binding. Signal
transduction required a 61-amino acid region containing 2 short segments
that share homology with other cytokine receptor family members. Gp130
molecules with mutations in either of these segments could not transduce
a growth signal. Loss of signal-transducing ability coincided with loss
of IL6-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of gp130.

Saito et al. (1992) determined that administration of IL6 in mice caused
upregulation of gp130 mRNA in several tissues. In liver, both gp130 and
Il6ra mRNA were upregulated by IL6.

Narazaki et al. (1993) determined that sgp130 within human serum or
exogenous recombinant sgp130 inhibited growth of transfected mouse pre-B
cells induced by the IL6/IL6R complex. Recombinant sgp130 also inhibited
growth in erythroleukemia cells stimulated by OSM or the CNTF/CNTFR
(118946) complex in a dose-dependent manner. Recombinant sgp130 was less
inhibitory to growth induced by LIF or the IL6/IL6R complex. Narazaki et
al. (1993) concluded that sgp130 has a role in modulating signals
transduced by membrane-bound gp130.

Chow et al. (2001) noted that cytokines that activate gp130 share a
common 4-helix bundle fold and that gp130 recognition of ligands occurs
through its cytokine-binding homology region, located at domains 2 and
3. In addition, activation occurs through a separate N-terminal, Ig-like
domain (domain 1). Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV, or
HHV-8) encodes a functional homolog of IL6 (termed vIL6; 25% sequence
homology) that is expressed in KSHV-infected cells and is able to induce
angiogenesis and hematopoiesis in IL6-dependent cell lines. In contrast
to IL6, which binds to gp130 only after it forms a complex with IL6RA,
vIL6 directly activates gp130. By crystal structure analysis, Chow et
al. (2001) demonstrated that in the extracellular signaling assembly
between vIL6 and gp130, 2 complexes are cross-linked into a tetramer
through direct interactions between the Ig domain of gp130 and site III
of vIL6, which is necessary for gp130 activation. Unlike IL6, vIL6 uses
mainly hydrophobic residues to contact gp130, enhancing the
complementarity of the vIL6-gp130 binding interfaces. Identical
positions of 2 disulfide bonds in IL6 and vIL6 and the high conservation
of the hydrophobic core residues account for the reproduction of the
helical scaffold by vIL6, enabling gp130 contact.

Pflanz et al. (2004) found that transfection of WSX1 (605350) into a
cell line expressing gp130 but only low levels of WSX1 resulted in IL27
(see 605816)-dependent phosphorylation of STAT1 (600555) and STAT3
(102582). In addition, they showed that anti-gp130 blocked IL27-mediated
cellular effects. Quantitative PCR analysis indicated that, in addition
to naive CD4 (186940)-positive T cells, numerous cell types expressed
both gp130 and WSX1, including mast cells. IL27 stimulation of mast
cells resulted in upregulation of proinflammatory cytokine expression.
Pflanz et al. (2004) concluded that IL27 not only contributes to the
development of an adaptive immune response through its action on
CD4-positive T cells, but also directly acts on cells of the innate
immune system.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

IL6 is an immunoregulatory cytokine that activates a cell-surface
signaling assembly composed of IL6, IL6RA, and the shared signaling
receptor gp130. Boulanger et al. (2003) solved the crystal structure of
the extracellular signaling complex to 3.65-angstrom resolution, which
revealed a hexameric, interlocking assembly mediated by a total of 10
symmetry-related, thermodynamically coupled interfaces. Assembly of the
hexameric complex occurs sequentially: IL6 is first engaged by
IL6R-alpha and then presented to gp130 in the proper geometry to
facilitate a cooperative transition into the high affinity,
signaling-competent hexamer. The quaternary structures of other IL6/IL12
family signaling complexes are likely constructed by means of a similar
topologic blueprint.

GENE STRUCTURE

Szalai et al. (2000) determined that the IL6ST gene contains 17 exons
and spans about 51 kb.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Rodriguez et al. (1995) assigned
the functional IL6ST gene to chromosome 5q11 and its nontranscribed
pseudogene to 17p11.

Hartz (2010) mapped the IL6ST gene to chromosome 5q11.2 based on an
alignment of the IL6ST sequence (GenBank GENBANK AB015706) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

- Pseudogenes

Kidd et al. (1992) concluded that there are 2 functional genes for
IL6ST. Rodriguez et al. (1995) showed, however, that the 2 localizations
correspond to a pseudogene (on chromosome 17) and the functional gene on
chromosome 5.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Rebouissou et al. (2009) demonstrated a marked activation of the IL6
(147620) signaling pathway in inflammatory hepatocellular adenomas.
Sequencing candidate genes pinpointed the response to somatic
gain-of-function mutations in the IL6ST gene, which encodes the
signaling coreceptor gp130. Rebouissou et al. (2009) found that 60% of
inflammatory hepatocellular adenomas harbor small in-frame deletions
that target the binding sites of gp130 for IL6, and expression of 4
different gp130 mutants in hepatocellular cells activated STAT3 (102582)
in the absence of ligand. Furthermore, analysis of hepatocellular
carcinomas revealed that rare gp130 alterations are always accompanied
by beta-catenin (116806)-activating mutations, suggesting a cooperative
effect of these signaling pathways in the malignant conversion of
hepatocytes. The recurrent gain-of-function gp130 mutations in these
human hepatocellular adenomas fully explains activation of the acute
inflammatory phase observed in tumorous hepatocytes, and suggests that
similar alterations may occur in other inflammatory epithelial tumors
with STAT activation.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using Cre-loxP-mediated recombination to generate mice harboring a
ventricular-restricted knockout of the gp130 cytokine receptor, Hirota
et al. (1999) demonstrated a critical role for a gp130-dependent myocyte
survival pathway in the transition to heart failure. Such conditional
mutant mice have normal cardiac structure and function, but during
aortic pressure overload, these mice displayed rapid onset of dilated
cardiomyopathy and massive induction of myocyte apoptosis compared with
the control mice, which exhibited compensatory hypertrophy. Thus,
cardiac myocyte apoptosis is a critical point in the transition between
compensatory cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. Hirota et al. (1999)
suggested that gp130-dependent cytokines may represent a novel
therapeutic strategy for preventing in vivo heart failure.

Tebbutt et al. (2002) noted that gp130 contains at least 2
cell-signaling modules. One encompasses 4 phosphotyrosine-binding sites
for the SH2 domains of STAT1 and STAT3, whereas the other includes a
phosphotyrosine that activates SHP2 (176876) upstream of the RAS
(190020)-ERK (see 601795) pathway. Tebbutt et al. (2002) generated mice
carrying targeted mutations in each of these modules. Mice homozygous
for a truncated version of gp130 lacking all Stat-binding sites
spontaneously developed intestinal ulceration at sites associated with
repeated mechanical trauma (gastric pylorus and rectum). Unlike wildtype
mice, those with the Stat-binding domain mutation were unable to recover
from trauma induced by ingestion of sodium dextran sulfate. Tebbutt et
al. (2002) noted that impaired wound healing occurs in Tff3
(600633)-null mice, and biochemical analysis confirmed reduced levels of
Tff3 in the mice with the Stat-binding domain mutation. Mice homozygous
for a tyr757-to-phe (Y757F) mutation, which inactivated the Shp2-binding
domain of gp130, developed normally into superficially healthy adults,
but they showed age-dependent enlargement of the stomach, proximal small
intestine, and spleen. Histologic examination revealed
hyperproliferative lesions within the antropyloric mucosa, often
circumferential, resulting in gastric outlet obstruction. Tebbutt et al.
(2002) noted that the gastric pathology was essentially phenocopied in
Tff1 (113710) null mice, and biochemical analysis of gastric Tff1 levels
in mice with the Shp2-binding domain mutation confirmed a 75% reduction
in comparison with wildtype mice; levels of Tff3 were elevated in the
mutant mice. Using a luciferase reporter assay with cells transiently
transfected with gp130 carrying the Stat- and Shp2-binding domain
mutations, Tebbutt et al. (2002) confirmed simultaneous activation of
the Stat1/Stat3 and Shp2-Ras-Erk pathways in response to IL6 activation,
resulting in enhanced luciferase activity of Tff1-luc and Tff3-luc
reporter constructs. Tebbutt et al. (2002) concluded that the
pathologies observed in the gp130 mutant mice resulted from disruption
of the normally simultaneous and coordinated activation of the
Stat1/Stat3 and Shp2-Ras-Erk signaling cascades.

Atsumi et al. (2002) generated mice with a tyr759-to-phe mutation in the
Shp2-binding site of gp130. These mice developed a rheumatoid arthritis
(RA; 180300)-like joint disease at about 1 year of age, accompanied by
autoantibody production and accumulation of memory/activated T cells and
myeloid cells. Before disease onset, T cells were hyperresponsive in
vitro. Mutant mice that were also Rag2 (179616) deficient did not
develop disease, indicating the importance of lymphocytes in this model.
Atsumi et al. (2002) concluded that point mutation in the gp130 cytokine
receptor can induce autoimmune disease.

Jenkins et al. (2005) assessed the contribution of exaggerated Stat3
activation to the phenotype of mice homozygous for Y757F, which disrupts
the negative feedback mechanism on gp130-dependent Stat signaling
(Tebbutt et al., 2002). They found that development of abnormalities
associated with gp130(Y757F) homozygosity, including reduced life span,
splenomegaly, exaggerated hepatic acute-phase response, and spontaneous
gastric adenomas while young, was attenuated when gp130(Y757F)
homozygosity was expressed on a Stat3 +/- background.

Both bone formation and resorption are altered significantly in gp130
-/- mice. Although the mutation results in neonatal lethality, reduced
trabecular bone mass, associated with an increase in osteoclastogenesis,
is a feature of the neonatal skeleton (Kawasaki et al., 1997; Shin et
al., 2004). Sims et al. (2004) found that mouse strains homozygous for
gp130 mutations in the Stat activation sites had normal trabecular bone
volume and bone turnover, but reduced bone length and premature growth
plate closure, suggesting a role for gp130-STAT1/3 signaling in
chondrocyte differentiation. In contrast, mice with mutations in the
gp130 Shp2-Ras-Mapk (see 176948) activation sites showed normal bone
size, but reduced trabecular bone volume and high bone turnover,
associated with increased osteoclastogenesis. Sims et al. (2004)
concluded that gp130 controls balanced regulation of bone growth and
mass depending on selective activation of distinct downstream signaling
pathways.

116952	TITLE *116952 CELL DIVISION CYCLE 42; CDC42
;;GTP-BINDING PROTEIN, 25-KD; G25K
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CDC42 is a Ras (see 190020)-related GTP-binding protein. It is
implicated in a variety of biologic activities, including establishment
of cell polarity in yeast, regulation of cell morphology, motility, and
cell cycle progression in mammalian cells, and induction of malignant
transformation (summary by Wu et al., 2000).

CLONING

Shinjo et al. (1990) isolated cDNA clones that code for cdc42, a low
molecular weight GTP-binding protein originally designated G(p) and also
called G25K, from a human placenta library. The predicted amino acid
sequence of the protein was very similar to those of various members of
the RAS superfamily of low molecular weight GTP-binding proteins,
including NRAS, KRAS, HRAS, and the RHO proteins. The highest degree of
sequence identity (80%) was found with the Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell
division cycle protein CDC42. The human placental gene complemented a
cdc42 mutation in S. cerevisiae. Munemitsu et al. (1990) presented
further evidence that G25K is the human homolog of the CDC42 gene
product.

Marks and Kwiatkowski (1996) identified 2 isoforms of mouse Cdc42. They
demonstrated that the 2 murine isoforms arise from a single gene by
alternative splicing. Although one is expressed in a wide variety of
tissues, the second isoform appeared to be expressed exclusively in
brain.

GENE FUNCTION

Erickson et al. (1996) used cell fractionation and immunofluorescence to
show that cdc42 is localized to the Golgi apparatus of mammalian cells.
It colocalizes with the nonclathrin coat proteins ARF3 (103190) and COPB
(600959) and its Golgi localization is disrupted by the drug brefeldin
A. Based on their findings, Erickson et al. (1996) suggested that cdc42
may be involved in the delivery of newly synthesized proteins and lipids
to the plasma membrane and that the GTP-binding/GTPase cycle may dictate
its subcellular localization.

By screening rat brain cytosol for proteins that interacted with
Ras-related GTPases, or p21 proteins, of the Rho (RHOA; 165390)
subfamily, Manser et al. (1994) identified 3 proteins, designated PAKs
(see PAK1; 602590) that interacted with the GTP-bound forms of human
CDC42 and RAC1 (602048), but not RHOA. Brown et al. (1996) found that
activity of human PAK1 was induced by coexpression with RAC1 or CDC42.

Zheng et al. (1996) reported that the FGD1 protein (305400) acts as a
cdc42-specific GDP-GTP exchange factor. Cells expressing a fragment of
the FGD1 protein encompassing the pleckstrin and Dbl homology domains
activated 2 elements downstream of cdc42, namely, Jun kinase (165160)
and p70 S6 kinase.

Manser et al. (1993) identified ACK1 (606994) as a binding partner and
inhibitor of the GTP-bound form of CDC42. Interaction between GTP-CDC42
and ACK1 inhibited both the intrinsic and GAP-stimulated GTPase activity
of CDC42.

CDC42 can regulate the actin cytoskeleton through activation of WASP
family members (see 301000). Activation relieves an autoinhibitory
contact between the GTPase-binding domain and the C-terminal region of
WASP proteins. Kim et al. (2000) reported the autoinhibited structure of
the GTPase-binding domain of WASP, which can be induced by the
C-terminal region or by organic cosolvents. In the autoinhibited
complex, intramolecular interactions with the GTPase-binding domain
occlude residues of the C terminus that regulate the Arp2/3
actin-nucleating complex (see 604221). Binding of CDC42 to the
GTPase-binding domain causes a dramatic conformational change, resulting
in disruption of the hydrophobic core and release of the C terminus,
enabling its interaction with the actin regulatory machinery.

Wu et al. (2000) identified a CDC42 mutant, Cdc42F28L, that binds GTP in
the absence of a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, but still
hydrolyzes GTP with a turnover number identical to that for wildtype
CDC42. Expression of this mutant in fibroblasts causes cellular
transformation, mimicking many of the characteristics of cells
transformed by the DBL oncoprotein (311030), a known guanine nucleotide
exchange factor for CDC42. Wu et al. (2000) searched for new CDC42
targets in an effort to understand how CDC42 mediates cellular
transformation. They identified the gamma-subunit of the coatomer
complex (gamma-COP; 604355) as a specific binding partner for activated
CDC42. The binding of CDC42 to gamma-COP is essential for a transforming
signal distinct from those elicited by Ras.

Dendritic cells (DCs) developmentally regulate antigen uptake by
controlling their endocytic capacity. Immature DCs actively internalize
antigen. Mature DCs, however, are poorly endocytic, functioning instead
to present antigens to T cells. Garrett et al. (2000) found that
endocytic downregulation reflects a decrease in endocytic activity
controlled by RHO family GTPases, especially CDC42. Blocking CDC42
function by toxin B treatment or injection of dominant-negative
inhibitors of CDC42 abrogated endocytosis in immature DCs. In mature
DCs, injection of constitutively active CDC42 or microbial delivery of a
CDC42 nucleotide exchange factor reactivated endocytosis. DCs regulated
endogenous levels of CDC42-GTP with activated CDC42 detectable only in
immature cells. Garrett et al. (2000) concluded that DCs developmentally
regulate endocytosis at least in part by controlling levels of activated
CDC42.

Using Mardin Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells expressing Cdc42 mutants
defective in nucleotide binding or hydrolysis, Musch et al. (2001)
showed that Cdc42 differentially regulated the exit of apical and
basolateral proteins from the trans-Golgi network (TGN).
GTPase-deficient Cdc42 accelerated the exit of an apical marker from the
TGN and inhibited the release of basolateral proteins. Basolateral
protein transport by Cdc42 with an activating mutation was accompanied
by changes in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton.

Sin et al. (2002) used in vivo time-lapse imaging of optic tectal cells
in Xenopus laevis tadpoles to demonstrate that enhanced visual activity
driven by a light stimulus promotes dendritic arbor growth. The
stimulus-induced dendritic arbor growth requires glutamate receptor (see
138249)-mediated synaptic transmission, decreased RhoA (165390)
activity, and increased RAC and CDC42 activity. Sin et al. (2002)
concluded that their results delineated a role for Rho GTPases in the
structural plasticity driven by visual stimulation in vivo.

Morphologic changes in dendritic spines are believed to be caused by
dynamic regulation of actin polymerization. Irie and Yamaguchi (2002)
found that the EphB2 receptor tyrosine kinase (600997) physically
associates with the guanine nucleotide exchange factor intersectin-1
(602442) in cooperation with the actin-regulating protein N-WASP
(605056), which in turn activates Cdc42 and spine morphogenesis.

In higher eukaryotes, the small GTPase CDC42, acting through a
PAR6-atypical protein kinase C (see PKC-zeta, 176982) complex, is
required to establish cellular asymmetry during epithelial
morphogenesis, asymmetric cell division, and directed cell migration.
Etienne-Manneville and Hall (2003) used primary rat astrocytes in a cell
migration assay to demonstrate that PAR6-PKC-zeta interacts directly
with and regulates glycogen synthase kinase-3-beta (GSK3-beta; 605004)
to promote polarization of the centrosome and to control the direction
of cell protrusion. CDC42-dependent phosphorylation of GSK3-beta occurs
specifically at the leading edge of migrating cells, and induces the
interaction of APC (611731) protein with the plus ends of microtubules.
The association of APC with microtubules is essential for cell
polarization. Etienne-Manneville and Hall (2003) concluded that CDC42
regulates cell polarity through the spatial regulation of GSK3-beta and
APC.

Wu et al. (2003) presented evidence that activation of CDC42 protects
EGF receptor (EGFR; 131550) from the negative regulatory activity of CBL
(165360), a ubiquitin ligase.

Yasuda et al. (2004) demonstrated that Cdc42 and mDia3 (DIAPH2; 300108)
regulate microtubule attachment to kinetochores.

Nalbant et al. (2004) reported the development of a biosensor capable of
visualizing the changing activation of endogenous unlabeled Cdc42 in
living cells. With the use of a dye that reports protein interactions,
the biosensor revealed localized activation in the trans-Golgi
apparatus, microtubule-dependent Cdc42 activation at the cell periphery,
and activation kinetics precisely coordinated with cell extension and
retraction.

By electroporating genes into chicken presomitic mesenchymal cells,
Nakaya et al. (2004) demonstrated that Cdc42 and Rac1 play different
roles in mesenchymal-epithelial transition. Different levels of Cdc42
appeared to affect the binary decision between epithelial and
mesenchymal states. Proper levels of Rac1 were also necessary for
somitic epithelialization, since cells with either activated or
inhibited Rac1 failed to undergo correct epithelialization.

Using functional and proteomic screens to identify regulators of Cdc42,
Wells et al. (2006) identified a network of proteins that centered on
Rich1 (ARHGAP17; 608293) and organized apical polarity in canine kidney
epithelial cells. Rich1 bound the coiled-coil domain of Amot (300410)
and was thereby targeted to a complex at tight junctions containing the
PDZ domain-containing proteins Pals1 (MPP5; 606958), Patj (INADL;
603199), and Par3 (PARD3; 606745). Regulation of Cdc42 by Rich1 was
required for maintenance of tight junctions. The coiled-coil domain of
Amot was required for its localization to apical membranes and for Amot
to relocalize Pals1 and Par3 to internal puncta. Wells et al. (2006)
proposed that RICH1 and AMOT maintain tight junction integrity by
coordinated regulation of CDC42 and by linking specific components of
the tight junction to intracellular protein trafficking.

Formation of the apical surface and lumen is a fundamental step in
epithelial organ development. Martin-Belmonte et al. (2007) showed that
Pten (601728) localized to the apical plasma membrane during epithelial
morphogenesis to mediate enrichment of phosphatidylinositol
4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) at this domain during cyst development
in a 3-dimensional Madin-Darby canine kidney cell system. Ectopic
PtdIns(4,5)P2 at the basolateral surface caused apical proteins to
relocalize to the basolateral surface. Annexin-2 (ANX2; 151740) bound
PtdIns(4,5)P2 and was recruited to the apical surface. Anx2 bound Cdc42
and recruited it to the apical surface, and Cdc42 in turn recruited the
Par6 (607484)/atypical protein kinase C (aPKC; see 176982) complex to
the apical surface. Loss of function of Pten, Anx2, Cdc42, or aPKC
prevented normal development of the apical surface and lumen.
Martin-Belmonte et al. (2007) concluded that PTEN, PtdIns(4,5)P2, ANX2,
CDC42, and aPKC control apical plasma membrane and lumen formation.

Hamann et al. (2007) found that both ASEF1 and ASEF2 were guanine
nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for CDC42, but not for RAC1 or RHOA.
ASEF2 required the lipid-modified form of CDC42. Using deletion mutants,
Hamann et al. (2007) showed that the tandem N-terminal ABR and SH3
domain (ABRSH3) of the ASEF proteins was required to bind the armadillo
repeat region of APC. ABRSH3 also functioned in an autoinhibitory
reaction by binding the C-terminal tails of ASEF1 and ASEF2 and
inhibiting their GEF activities. Deletion of ABRSH3 or coexpression of
the APC armadillo repeat sequence with full-length ASEF2 stimulated
filopodia formation in transfected HeLa cells. Hamann et al. (2007)
concluded that activation of ASEF1 and ASEF2 involves binding of APC to
ABRSH3, which disrupts the autoinhibitory interaction of ABRSH3 with the
ASEF C-terminal tail and allows GDP/GTP exchange on CDC42.

Kawasaki et al. (2007) found that ASEF2 was a GEF for both CDC42 and
RAC1 in MDCK and HeLa cells. Overexpression of ASEF2 increased membrane
ruffling and CDC42-mediated filopodia formation in HeLa cells.

Shen et al. (2008) showed that Nudel (NDEL1; 607538) colocalized with
Cdc42gap (ARHGAP1; 602732) at the leading edge of migrating NIH3T3 mouse
fibroblasts. This localization of Nudel required its phosphorylation by
Erk1 (MAPK3; 601795)/Erk2 (MAPK1; 176948). Shen et al. (2008) found that
Nudel competed with Cdc42 for binding Cdc42gap. Consequently, Nudel
inhibited Cdc42gap-mediated inactivation of Cdc42 in a dose-dependent
manner. Depletion of Nudel by RNA interference or overexpression of a
nonphosphorylatable Nudel mutant abolished Cdc42 activation and cell
migration. Shen et al. (2008) concluded that NUDEL facilitates cell
migration by sequestering CDC42GAP at the leading edge to stabilize
active CDC42 in response to extracellular stimuli.

Kang et al. (2008) performed a global characterization of rat neural
palmitoyl proteomes and identified most of the known neural palmitoyl
proteins, 68 in total, plus more than 200 novel palmitoyl protein
candidates, with further testing confirming palmitoylation for 21 of
these candidates. The novel palmitoyl proteins included neurotransmitter
receptors, transporters, adhesion molecules, scaffolding proteins, as
well as SNAREs and other vesicular trafficking proteins. Of particular
interest was the finding of palmitoylation for a brain-specific Cdc42
splice variant. The palmitoylated Cdc42 isoform (Cdc42-palm) differs
from the canonical, prenylated form (Cdc42-prenyl), with regard to both
localization and function: Cdc42-palm concentrates in dendritic spines
and has a special role in inducing these postsynaptic structures.
Furthermore, assessing palmitoylation dynamics in drug-induced activity
models identified rapidly induced changes for Cdc42 as well as for other
synaptic palmitoyl proteins, suggesting that palmitoylation may
participate broadly in the activity-driven changes that shape synapse
morphology and brain function.

Machacek et al. (2009) examined GTPase coordination in mouse embryonic
fibroblasts both through simultaneous visualization of 2 GTPase
biosensors and using a 'computational multiplexing' approach capable of
defining the relationships between multiple protein activities
visualized in separate experiments. They found that RhoA (165390) is
activated at the cell edge synchronous with edge advancement, whereas
Cdc42 and Rac1 are activated 2 microns behind the edge with a delay of
40 seconds. This indicates that Rac1 and RhoA operate antagonistically
through spatial separation and precise timing, and that RhoA has a role
in the initial events of protrusion, whereas Rac1 and Cdc42 activate
pathways implicated in reinforcement and stabilization of newly expanded
protrusions.

Frank et al. (2009) found that Cdc42 was involved in a signaling complex
that modulated presynaptic Cav2.1 (CACNA1A; 601011) calcium channels in
the Drosophila neuromuscular junction. This signaling system involved
the Rho-type GEF ephexin (NGEF; 605991), which appeared to act with
Cdc42 to activate the Eph receptor (see EPHA1; 179610) for modulation of
Cav2.1 channel activity.

Murakoshi et al. (2011) used 2-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging
microscopy to monitor the activity of 2 Rho GTPases, RhoA and Cdc42, in
single dendritic spines undergoing structural plasticity associated with
long-term potentiation in CA1 pyramidal neurons in cultured slices of
rat hippocampus. When long-term volume increase was induced in a single
spine using 2-photon glutamate uncaging, RhoA and Cdc42 were rapidly
activated in the stimulated spine. These activities decayed over about 5
minutes, and were then followed by a phase of persistent activation
lasting more than half an hour. Although active RhoA and Cdc42 were
similarly mobile, their activity patterns were different. RhoA
activation diffused out of the stimulated spine and spread over about 5
microns along the dendrite. In contrast, Cdc42 activation was restricted
to the stimulated spine, and exhibited a steep gradient at the spine
necks. Inhibition of the Rho-Rock pathway preferentially inhibited the
initial spine growth, whereas the inhibition of the Cdc42-Pak pathway
blocked the maintenance of sustained structural plasticity. RhoA and
Cdc42 activation depended on calcium ion/calmodulin-dependent kinase
(CaMKII). Thus, Murakoshi et al. (2011) concluded that RhoA and Cdc42
relay transient CaMKII activation to synapse-specific, long-term
signaling required for spine structural plasticity.

Using synthetic derivatives of the enteropathogenic Escherichia coli
guanine-nucleotide exchange factor Map, Orchard et al. (2012) found that
CDC42 GTPase signal transduction was controlled by interaction between
Map and the PDZ domains of EBP50 (SLC9A3R1; 604990) and the induction of
clusters of actin-rich membrane protrusions.

Keestra et al. (2013) demonstrated that NOD1 (605980) senses cytosolic
microbial products by monitoring the activation state of small Rho
GTPases. Activation of RAC1 (602048) and CDC42 by bacterial delivery or
ectopic expression of SopE, a virulence factor of the enteric pathogen
Salmonella, triggered the NOD1 signaling pathway with consequent RIP2
(603455)-mediated induction of NF-kappa-B (see 164011)-dependent
inflammatory responses. Similarly, activation of the NOD1 signaling
pathway by peptidoglycan required RAC1 activity. Furthermore, Keestra et
al. (2013) showed that constitutively active forms of RAC1, CDC42, and
RHOA (165390) activated the NOD1 signaling pathway.

GENE STRUCTURE

Nicole et al. (1999) determined the organization of the CDC42 gene and
found that the gene encodes the placental and brain isoforms generated
by alternative splicing.

Moats-Staats and Stiles (1995) showed that the 5-prime end of another
gene, called BB1 by them (601106), overlaps the 3-prime end of G25K.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Through a structural analysis of DOCK9 (607325)-CDC42 complexes, Yang et
al. (2009) identified a nucleotide sensor within the alpha-10 helix of
the DHR2 domain that contributes to release of guanine diphosphate (GDP)
and then to discharge of the activated GTP-bound Cdc42. Magnesium
exclusion, a critical factor in promoting GDP release, is mediated by a
conserved valine residue within this sensor, whereas binding of
GTP-magnesium ion to the nucleotide-free complex results in
magnesium-inducing displacement of the sensor to stimulate discharge of
Cdc42-GTP. Yang et al. (2009) concluded that their studies identified an
unusual mechanism of GDP release and defined the complete guanine
nucleotide exchange factor catalytic cycle from GDP dissociation
followed by GTP binding and discharge of the activated GTPase.

MAPPING

Using SSCP analysis of a mouse backcross panel, Marks and Kwiatkowski
(1996) demonstrated that the gene encoding cdc42 is localized to the
distal portion of mouse chromosome 4 between Ephb2 proximally and Cappb
(601572) distally. The human homologs of both of the 2 flanking genes
were mapped to human chromosome 1p36.1 by Barron-Casella et al. (1995),
thus indicating that this is the likely site of the human CDC42 gene.
The CDC42 gene was mapped to the 1p36-p35 region by radiation hybrid
analysis (Schuler et al., 1996; Jensen et al., 1997; Deloukas et al.,
1998).

Nicole et al. (1999) demonstrated a CDC42-like transcript on chromosome
4 that does not contain introns and is similar to the placental isoform,
suggesting that it is a processed pseudogene.

Nicole et al. (1999) excluded the CDC42 gene as the site of mutation in
the Schwartz-Jampel syndrome type 1 (255800).

ANIMAL MODEL

Wu et al. (2006) stated that constitutive knockout of Cdc42 in mice
results in death around implantation. In order to examine the role of
Cdc42 in the differentiation of skin stem cells into hair follicles,
they targeted Cdc42 deletion to keratinocytes. Mutant mice were born
without obvious defects but showed impaired hair formation and growth
retardation. Within 4 weeks, all hairs were lost and did not grow again
in older animals. In the absence of Cdc42, degradation of beta-catenin
(CTNNB1; 116806) increased corresponding to decreased phosphorylation of
Gsk3-beta and increased phosphorylation of axin (603816), which is
required for binding of beta-catenin to the degradation machinery. Wu et
al. (2006) concluded that Cdc42 regulation of beta-catenin turnover is
required for terminal differentiation of hair follicle progenitor cells.

By targeted deletion of Cdc42 in telencephalic neural progenitors in
mouse embryos, Chen et al. (2006) found that Cdc42 was essential for
establishment of apical-basal polarity of the telencephalic
neuroepithelium, a necessity for expansion and bifurcation of cerebral
hemispheres.

605541	TITLE *605541 VAV3 ONCOGENE; VAV3
;;ONCOGENE VAV3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the VAV family, such as VAV3, are guanine nucleotide exchange
factors (GEFs) for Rho (see 165390) and Rac (see 602048) family GTPases.
Upon cell stimulation, VAV proteins become rapidly and transiently
phosphorylated on tyrosine residues, leading to activation of their
GDP-GTP exchange activity towards Rho/Rac proteins. VAV proteins are an
essential and direct link between receptors with intrinsic or associated
tyrosine kinase activity and the mitogenic and cytoskeletal pathways
regulated by Rho/Rac proteins (review by Bustelo, 2000).

CLONING

By searching EST databases for sequences corresponding with fragments of
VAV1 (164875) and VAV2 (600428), followed by screening a placenta cDNA
library, Movilla and Bustelo (1999) isolated a cDNA encoding VAV3. The
predicted 847-amino acid protein shares approximately 69% and 66%
sequence similarity with VAV1 and VAV2, respectively. It contains Dbl
homology (DH) and pleckstrin homology domains, common in Rho and Rac
GEFs, as well as a calponin homology (CH) region, an acidic motif, a
zinc finger (ZF) domain, 2 SH3 regions, and 1 SH2 domain, like the other
VAVs. Northern and dot blot analyses revealed variable but wide
expression of a 5-kb transcript, with highest levels in peripheral blood
lymphocytes, spleen, and brain, and lower levels in thymus, heart,
kidney, liver, placenta, and lung.

Trenkle et al. (2000) identified a splice variant of VAV3, which they
termed VAV3.1, that encodes a VAV3 isoform containing only the
C-terminal SH3-SH2-SH3 region.

GENE FUNCTION

Using immunoblot analysis, Movilla and Bustelo (1999) found that VAV3
displayed low levels of tyrosine phosphorylation in nonstimulated cells,
but became rapidly phosphorylated upon T-cell receptor (TCR; see 186880)
or epidermal growth factor (EGF; 131530) receptor (131550) activation.
Analysis of enzymatic activity showed that VAV3 acted as a GEF
preferentially on RhoG (ARHG; 179505), RhoA (ARHA; 165390), and, to a
lesser extent, RAC1 (602048), and it associated maximally with these
GTPases in the nucleotide-free state. In contrast to VAV1 and VAV2,
neither full-length nor truncated versions of VAV3 induced cellular
transformation either alone or in combination with a mutant protein
tyrosine kinase, LCK (153390). On the other hand, confocal microscopy
analysis showed that expression of truncated VAV3 lacking the CH domain
or the CH and SH3/SH2 domains, but containing active DH and ZF domains,
led to extensive lamellipodia, membrane ruffling, and the formation of
an actomyosin ring, similar to the changes elicited by VAV1 and VAV2.
These truncated proteins were expressed predominantly in the perinuclear
area and along stress fibers, membrane ruffles, and the plasma membrane
of nonmitotic fibroblasts, colocalizing with F-actin (see ACTA1;
102610). Microscopic analysis also showed that the truncated VAV3
proteins, particularly those with the N-terminal CH deletion, but not
VAV1 or the LBC oncogene (604686), induced defects in cytokinesis and
the generation of polynucleated cells.

Moores et al. (2000) expressed VAV1, VAV2, and VAV3 at equivalent levels
and found that each responded to similar surface receptor tyrosine
kinases. Integrin-induced phosphorylation required the presence of SYK
(600085). Only VAV1 could efficiently cooperate with TCR signaling to
enhance NFAT (600489)-dependent transcription, while only VAV1 and VAV3
could enhance nuclear factor kappa-B (NFKB; see 164011)-dependent
transcription.

Trenkle et al. (2000) found that the VAV3.1 splice variant appeared to
be downregulated by EGF and transforming growth factor-beta (TGFB;
190180).

Bustelo (2000) presented a comprehensive review of the regulatory and
signaling properties of the VAV family.

MAPPING

Bustelo (2000) stated that the VAV3 gene maps to chromosome 1 (TMAP
stSG3811).

ANIMAL MODEL

Faccio et al. (2005) generated Vav3 -/- mice and observed increased bone
density and protection from bone loss induced by systemic bone
resorption stimuli. Vav3-deficient osteoclasts showed defective actin
cytoskeleton organization, polarization, spreading, and resorptive
activity. Diminished Vav3 phosphorylation was observed in
protein-tyrosine kinase (SYK; 600085)-deficient preosteoclasts in vitro.
Vav3 +/- Syk +/- mice had increased bone mass, and Vav3 +/- Syk +/-
osteoclasts did not resorb bone in vitro. Faccio et al. (2005) concluded
that VAV3 is essential for stimulated osteoclast activation and bone
density in vivo, and that SYK is a crucial upstream regulator of VAV3 in
osteoclasts.

Sauzeau et al. (2006) found that Vav3-deficient mice demonstrated
tachycardia, systemic arterial hypertension, and extensive
cardiovascular remodeling consistent with hypertension by 4 months of
age. Further analysis showed activation of the renin (REN;
179820)-angiotensin (see 106150) system, which was confirmed by
pharmacologic studies, and hyperactivity of sympathetic neurons with
high catecholamine levels. The mice showed a resultant progressive loss
of cardiovascular and renal homeostasis.

Sindrilaru et al. (2009) observed impaired wound closure in Vav3 -/-
mice, but not in Vav1 -/- or Vav2 -/- mice. Delayed wound healing in
Vav3 -/- mice was associated with diminished numbers of macrophages,
myofibroblasts, and blood vessels. Recruitment of polymorphonuclear
neutrophils (PMNs) to the wound site was normal. After clearing wounds
of invading pathogens, PMNs normally undergo apoptosis and are removed
by macrophages by adhesion-dependent phagocytosis. Macrophages then
release activated TGF-beta-1 (TGFB1; 190180), which initiates
myofibroblast differentiation, followed by myofibroblast-driven wound
contraction and neoangiogenesis. Wounds of Vav3 -/- mice showed
defective beta-2 integrin (ITGB2; 600065)-dependent adhesion between
apoptotic PMNs and macrophages and defective release of active
Tgf-beta-1 from macrophages. Local injection of either Vav3-competent
macrophages or recombinant human TGF-beta-1 into wounds of Vav3 -/- mice
fully rescued wound healing. Sindrilaru et al. (2009) concluded that
VAV3 is critical for formation of the phagocytic synapse between
macrophages and PMNs and initiation of wound repair.

601882	TITLE *601882 DNA FRAGMENTATION FACTOR, 45-KD, ALPHA SUBUNIT; DFFA
;;DFF1;;
DFF45;;
INHIBITOR OF CASPASE-ACTIVATED DNase; ICAD
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Liu et al. (1997) identified and purified from HeLa cytosol a protein
that induces DNA fragmentation in coincubated nuclei after it is
activated by caspase-3 (600636). This protein, designated DNA
fragmentation factor (DFF) by them, was found to be a heterodimer of
40-kD (DFFB; 601883) and 45-kD (DFFA) subunits. Amino acid sequence of
the HeLa cell 45-kD subunit, determined from its cDNA sequence, showed
that it is a novel protein.

GENE FUNCTION

Liu et al. (1997) determined that caspase-3 cleaves the 45-kD subunit at
2 sites to generate an active factor that produces DNA fragmentation
without further requirement of caspase-3 or other cytosolic proteins. In
cells undergoing apoptosis, the 45-kD subunit was cleaved in the same
pattern as it is cleaved by caspase-3 in vitro. These results delineated
a direct signal transduction pathway during apoptosis: caspase-3 to DFF
to DNA fragmentation.

Inohara et al. (1998) reported the identification and characterization
of 2 mammalian genes, which they called CIDEA (604440) and CIDEB
(604441) (cell death-inducing DFFA-like effectors A and B), encoding
highly related proteins with homology to the N-terminal region of DFF45.
CIDEA and CIDEB were found to activate apoptosis in mammalian cells, and
this was inhibited by DFF45 but not by caspase inhibitors. Expression of
CIDEA induced DNA fragmentation in 293T cells, and this was also
inhibited by DFF45, further suggesting that DFF45 inhibits the apoptotic
activities of CIDEs. In addition to mammalian CIDEA and CIDEB, Inohara
et al. (1998) identified DREP1, a Drosophila homolog of DFF45 that could
inhibit CIDEA-mediated apoptosis. Mutant analysis revealed that the
C-terminal region of CIDEA was necessary and sufficient for killing,
whereas the region with homology to DFF45 located in the N terminus was
required for DFF45 to inhibit CIDEA-induced apoptosis. CD95/Fas
(134637)-mediated apoptosis was enhanced by CIDEs but inhibited by
DFF45. These studies suggested that DFF45 is evolutionarily conserved
and implicated CIDEs as DFF45-inhibitable effectors that promote cell
death and DNA fragmentation.

GENE STRUCTURE

By in silico analysis, Abel et al. (2002) determined that the DFFA gene
contains 6 exons that span approximately 11 kb of genomic DNA.

MAPPING

Leek et al. (1997) mapped the DFFA gene to 1p36.3-p36.2 by fluorescence
in situ hybridization.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Abel et al. (2002) presented evidence that the DFFA gene is located in
the smallest region of deletion overlap in Scandinavian neuroblastoma
tumors (see 256700). They performed genomic sequence analysis of DFFA
and caspase-9 (602234) in 44 primary neuroblastoma tumors and in 2
detected a rare allelic variant in the DFFA gene, i.e., a 206T-C
transition in exon 2, resulting in a nonpolar-to-polar substitution
(ile69 to thr; I60T) in a preserved hydrophobic patch of the protein.
The variant was present in hemizygous form due to deletion of the more
common allele of this polymorphism in 1 tumor and was present in
heterozygous form in the other. Only 1 of 194 normal control alleles was
found to carry this variant; thus, none of 97 healthy control
individuals was homozygous. Moreover, RT-PCR expression studies showed
that the DFFA gene was expressed in low-stage neuroblastoma tumors and
to a lesser degree in high-stage neuroblastomas.

300222	TITLE *300222 INTEGRAL MEMBRANE PROTEIN 2A; ITM2A
;;E25A
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By differential screening of a cDNA library constructed from in vitro
cultured condyles, Deleersnijder et al. (1996) isolated a novel gene in
the mouse, which they called E25A, or integral membrane protein-2
(Itm2). The full-length E25A cDNA was predicted to encode a type II
integral membrane protein of 263 amino acid residues. In situ
hybridization showed that E25A is expressed in the outer perichondrial
rim of the postnatal mandibular condyle, which contains the
proliferating progenitor cells, but not in the deeper layers of the
condyle containing the more differentiated chondroblasts and
chondrocytes. Strong in situ hybridization signals were also detected on
bone trabeculae of mature bone, in tooth germs, and in hair follicles.
Northern blot analysis showed strong expression in osteogenic tissues,
such as neonatal mouse calvaria, paws, and tail, and in skin. Homology
searches of DNA databanks showed that E25A belongs to a novel multigene
family, containing at least 3 members in both man and mouse.

Mao et al. (1998) found that the human homolog of murine E25A is
expressed in human CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells.

By subtractive hybridization for sequences differentially expressed by
plasmacytoid dendritic cells, Rissoan et al. (2002) detected ITM2A,
which they designated BRI3. The deduced type II transmembrane protein
contains an N-terminal cytosolic domain, an uncleaved signal anchor
sequence, and a tyrosine-rich C-terminal extracellular domain. The
312-amino acid mouse Itm2a protein shares 91% homology with human ITM2A.
RT-PCR of human lymphoid cells showed higher expression of ITM2A in
plasmacytoid dendritic cells than in monocytes and monocyte-derived
dendritic cells. A faint band was detected in CD34-derived dendritic
cells. Northern blot analysis revealed a 2.1-kb transcript in several
lymphoid tissues, including appendix, peripheral blood leukocytes, bone
marrow, fetal liver, with lower levels in spleen, lymph nodes, and
thymus.

MAPPING

Deleersnijder et al. (1996) mapped the mouse E25A gene to the X
chromosome.

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Pittois et al. (1999) mapped the
mouse Itm2a gene to chromosome XA2-A3 and the human homolog to
Xq13.3-q21.2.

;;DYNAMITIN;;
DYNACTIN COMPLEX, 50-KD SUBUNIT; DCTN50
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

DCTN2 is a 50-kD subunit of dynactin, a multiprotein complex associated
with dynein. Cytoplasmic dynein is a molecular motor responsible for
minus-end-directed movement along microtubules. See DCTN1 (601143) and
DNCH1 (600112) for additional information about the dynactin complex and
dynein.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the DCTN2
gene to chromosome 12 (TMAP RH70660).

ANIMAL MODEL

LaMonte et al. (2002) generated a mouse model of amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis (ALS; 105400) by overexpressing dynamitin in postnatal motor
neurons of transgenic mice. They found that dynamitin overexpression
disrupted the dynein-dynactin complex, resulting in an inhibition of
retrograde axonal transport. The authors observed a late-onset, slowly
progressive motor neuron degenerative disease in the transgenic mice and
concluded that their mouse model confirms the critical role of disrupted
axonal transport in the pathogenesis of motor neuron degenerative
disease.

CACP GENE; CACP;;
SUPERFICIAL ZONE PROTEIN; SZP
HEMANGIOPOIETIN, INCLUDED; HAPO, INCLUDED;;
LUBRICIN, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Merberg et al. (1993) first detected megakaryocyte-stimulating factor
(MSF) in the urine of patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation
during a period of acute thrombocytopenia. Subsequent cloning studies
demonstrated that this 20- to 25-kD urinary metabolite of MSF was an
N-terminal cysteine-rich polypeptide component derived from a larger,
highly glycosylated precursor protein of approximately 400 kD. The
smaller urinary metabolite was shown to stimulate growth in both pure
and mixed megakaryocyte colonies from bone marrow fibrin cultures. MSF
precursor is a multifunctional domain protein with polypeptide sequence
homologies to both serum adhesive glycoproteins and secretory mucins
(see 158370). Articular cartilage MSF precursor contains large (76 to 78
repeats) and small (6 to 8 repeats) mucin-like O-ringed
oligosaccharide-rich repeat domains flanked by cysteine-rich N- and
C-terminal domains that are homologous to the somatomedin B and
hemopexin domains of vitronectin (193190), respectively.

Schumacher et al.(1994) described superficial zone protein (SZP), an
approximately 345-kD proteoglycan specifically synthesized by
chondrocytes located at the surface of bovine articular cartilage, and
also by some synovial lining cells. They demonstrated that SZP is
secreted by superficial zone chondrocytes and not by chondrocytes from
other zones of articular cartilage. SZP contains both chondroitin
sulfate and keratan sulfate glycosaminoglycans. SZP is extensively
degraded by papain, trypsin (276000), and pronase, but limited pepsin
(see 169700) treatment decreases its molecular mass only to 315 kD. SZP
is predominantly found in the media of explant and cell cultures.

Flannery et al. (1999) used cDNA sequencing and homology analysis to
elucidate the complete amino acid composition for the superficial zone
protein from human and bovine cartilage. They established that human
cartilage SZP is homologous with the proteoglycan first described as the
precursor protein of a megakaryocyte-stimulating factor by Merberg et
al. (1993). The cDNA encodes a protein of 1,404 amino acids with a
somatomedin B homology domain, heparin-binding domains, multiple
mucin-like repeats, a hemopexin domain, and an aggregation domain. There
are 3 consensus sequences for N-glycosylation and 1 chondroitin sulfate
substitution site. Bovine SZP and human MSF precursor sequences are
about 75% identical at both the nucleotide and amino acid levels.

Using a positional cloning approach, Marcelino et al. (1999) identified
the MSF gene within the chromosome 1q25-q31 critical region for the
autosomal recessive camptodactyly-arthropathy-coxa vara-pericarditis
syndrome (CACP; 208250) locus. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that
a 4.5-kb MSF mRNA is expressed in several tissues, including liver,
lung, and heart, and is highly expressed in synovial tissue. A 30-kD
N-terminal MSF fragment was detectable in serum and urine.

By Northern blot analysis, Ikegawa et al. (2000) demonstrated limited
expression of the human PRG4 gene as 4.2- and 1.7-kb transcripts;
expression was strongest in liver, but was also observed in heart,
brain, and muscle. RT-PCR analysis demonstrated strong expression in
cartilage. RT-PCR also detected 4 types of alternative splicing. Type A
consisted of exons 1-6, type B of exons 1 and 3-5, type C of exons 1-3,
and type D of exons 1 and 3. Resultant deletions caused by skipping
these exons were all in-frame. Types A and B were expressed
ubiquitously; types C and D showed tissue-limited expression.

The cells of hematopoietic and vascular endothelial cell lineages are
believed to share a common precursor, termed the hemangioblast. Liu et
al. (2004) reported the identification of hemangiopoietin (HAPO), a
novel growth factor acting on both hematopoietic and endothelial cell
lineages. The cDNA clone encoding HAPO is an alternative splicing
variant lacking exon 5 of PRG4, as demonstrated by a comparative cDNA
sequence analysis of HAPO and PRG4. Liu et al. (2004) suggested that
HAPO may have a clinical potential in the treatment of various
cytopenias and radiation injury and in the expansion of hematopoietic
and endothelial stem/progenitor cells.

Jay et al. (2000) purified lubricin from pooled synovial fluid with
normal lubricating activity that was obtained from patients with
osteoarthritis. Purified lubricin has an apparent molecular mass of 280
kD by SDS-PAGE; deglycosylation decreased the apparent molecular mass to
120 kD. Sequencing revealed a 100% match with exons 6 to 9 of the MSF
gene. Lubricin exhibited boundary-lubricating activity similar to that
of whole synovial fluid. Jay et al. (2000) concluded that lubricin is
secreted by synovial fibroblasts. They stated that lubricin is the only
lubricating component in the final lubricating fraction of human
synovial fluid.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ikegawa et al. (2000) determined that the human and mouse PRG4 genes
each contain 12 exons and that they span 18 and 16 kb, respectively.

MAPPING

Using a positional cloning approach, Marcelino et al. (1999) identified
the MSF gene within the chromosome 1q25-q31 critical region for the
autosomal recessive camptodactyly-arthropathy-coxa vara-pericarditis
syndrome (CACP; 208250) locus.

By FISH, Ikegawa et al. (2000) mapped the human PRG4 gene to chromosome
1q24-q25. By the same method they mapped the mouse mouse Prg4 gene to
chromosome 1G, in a region showing syntenic homology to human 1q24-q25.

GENE FUNCTION

Jay et al. (2007) used a multiple-particle-tracking microrheology
technique to study the molecular interaction between lubricin and
hyaluronic acid in bovine synovial fluid. They found that lubricin
affects the diffusive behavior of synovial fluid and contributes to the
elastic absorption and energy dissipation of synovial fluid at
physiologic shear frequencies. In studies involving synovial fluid from
a patient with camptodactyly-arthropathy-coxa vara-pericarditis,
hyaluronic acid molecules adopted an extended and more rigid
conformation, suggesting that synovial fluid lacking lubricin would be
less able to dissipate the energy of impact that occurs during mammalian
locomotion. Jay et al. (2007) concluded that lubricin provides a
chondroprotective feature to synovial fluid that is distinct from the
role lubricin plays at the cartilage surface as a boundary lubricant.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Marcelino et al. (1999) identified 8 likely disease-causing mutations in
the MSF gene in patients with CACP from consanguineous families. Four
were homozygous deletions. Additionally, they detected a dinucleotide
transversion that created a nonsense codon, and a 41-bp insertion 14
nucleotides upstream of the intron 6 splice acceptor site that disrupted
the polypyrimidine tract of the splice site. Each of these mutations was
predicted to result in a truncated protein. Due to its high
glycosylation content and mucin-like repeats, Marcelino et al. (1999)
suggested that MSF may act as a joint/intimal cell lubricant. Both
synovial and pericardial cell hyperplasia may represent secondary
consequences of insufficient cell surface lubrication. Alternatively,
cell overgrowth may be primary to the pathogenesis of CACP.

ANIMAL MODEL

Rhee et al. (2005) generated Prg4 -/- mice, in which joints appeared
normal at birth; with aging there were abnormal protein deposits on the
cartilage surface, disappearance of underlying superficial zone
chondrocytes, and hyperplasia of intimal cells in the synovium. Purified
or recombinant lubricin inhibited the growth of those synoviocytes in
vitro. Tendon and tendon sheath involvement was present in the ankle
joints, with morphologic changes and abnormal calcification. Rhee et al.
(2005) concluded that lubricin has multiple functions in articulating
joints and tendons that include the protection of surfaces and control
of synovial cell growth.

IPORIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones from a size-fractionated brain cDNA library, Nagase
et al. (1997) cloned a partial RUSC2 cDNA, which they called KIAA0375.
RT-PCR detected high expression in human kidney, ovary, and testis,
followed by moderate expression in brain, placenta, lung, liver, and
skeletal muscle, and low expression in prostate and small intestine.

By yeast 2-hybrid screen of a human placental cDNA library with mutant
Rab1b (612565) as prey, Bayer et al. (2005) identified RUSC2, which they
called iporin. The deduced 1516-amino acid protein contains a RUN domain
and an SH3 domain, as well as proline and glutamic acid-rich regions.
The mouse homolog shares 84% similarity to human RUSC2. Northern blot
analysis of human tissues detected ubiquitous expression of a 5.5-kb
transcript, with highest levels in brain and testis. The RUN domain of
RUSC2 mediated binding to Rab1. Western blot analysis detected a 220-kD
protein mainly associated with membrane fractions. Immunofluorescence
microscopy showed a cytosolic distribution with punctate perinuclear
enrichment. RUSC2 interacted with the Rab1-binding protein GM130
(GOLGA2; 602580) on yeast 2-hybrid and in vitro binding assays.

GENE STRUCTURE

Bayer et al., 2005 determined that the RUSC2 gene contains 11 exons and
spans about 14 kb.

MAPPING

Bayer et al. (2005) noted that the RUSC2 gene maps to chromosome 9p13.1.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The UGTs are of major importance in the conjugation and subsequent
elimination of potentially toxic xenobiotics and endogenous compounds.
UGT2B8 demonstrates reactivity with estriol. See UGT2B4 (600067).

CLONING

Coffman et al. (1990) found that the cDNA corresponding to UGT2B8 is
2,094 bp and encodes a protein of 523 amino acids, including a 16-amino
acid leader sequence, and has an untranslated 3-prime region of 525 bp.

MAPPING

The steroid-metabolizing isoforms of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase are
encoded by multiple genes. By fluorescence in situ hybridization with a
YAC containing all 3 genes, Monaghan et al. (1994) localized UGT2B4,
UGT2B9 (600068), and UGT2B15 to 4q13. They provisionally ordered the
genes as UGT2B9--UGT2B4--UGT2B15.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Iida et al. (2002) provided a catalog of 86 SNPs in 3 uridine
diphosphate glycosyltransferase genes: UGT2A1 (604716), UGT2B15, and
UGT8 (601291).

POPULATION GENETICS

Using DNA from 100 healthy unrelated Caucasian volunteers, Menard et al.
(2009) characterized the common UGT2B17 (601903) and UGT2B28 (606497)
deletions and observed that their cooccurrence with a D85Y polymorphism
(dbSNP rs1902023) in the UGT2B15 gene generates 7 distinct haplotypes.
The authors concluded that analyzing copy number variation of UGT2B17
without evaluating UGT2B28 and the D85Y variant in UGT2B15 may over- or
underestimate the phenotypic impact of each gene.

;;C27-3-BETA-HSD
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Schwarz et al. (2000) used expression cloning to isolate cDNAs encoding
a microsomal 3-beta-hydroxy-delta-5-C27-steroid oxidoreductase that is
expressed predominantly in the liver. The predicted product showed 34%
sequence identity with the C19 and C21 3-beta-HSD enzymes, which
participate in steroid hormone metabolism. Schwarz et al. (2000)
observed that, when transfected into cultured cells, the enzyme encoded
by the C27 3-beta-HSD cDNA was active against four 7-alpha-hydroxylated
sterols, indicating that a single C27 3-beta-HSD enzyme can participate
in all pathways of bile acid synthesis known to that time. The expressed
enzyme did not metabolize several different C19/21 steroids as
substrates. The levels of hepatic C27 3-beta-HSD mRNA in the mouse were
not sexually dimorphic and did not change in response to dietary
cholesterol or to changes in bile acid pool size. The human C27
3-beta-HSD gene encodes a protein of 369 amino acids that is about 86%
identical to the mouse protein.

MAPPING

Schwarz et al. (2000) mapped the human HSD3B7 gene to chromosome
16p12-p11.2 by analysis of radiation hybrid panels.

Schwarz et al. (2000) determined that the HSD3B7 gene contains 6 exons
and spans 3 kb of DNA.

GENE FUNCTION

Schwarz et al. (2000) observed that the C27 3-beta-HSD enzymes are
active only against 7-alpha hydroxylated sterol substrates. Human C27
3-beta-HSD enzymes were active against the 7-alpha hydroxylated forms of
24-hydroxycholesterol, 25-hydroxycholesterol, and 27-hydroxycholesterol
and showed no preference for any of those compounds. Northern blot
analysis identified a single 2.4-kb species present at high levels in
liver, pancreas, and kidney, and at lower levels in heart, skeletal
muscle, and placenta.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Schwarz et al. (2000) identified a 2-bp deletion in the C27 3-beta-HSD
gene (607764.0001) in a patient with a congenital defect in bile acid
synthesis (CBAS1; 607765) and neonatal cholestasis.

Cheng et al. (2003) performed a molecular analysis of 15 additional
patients from 13 kindreds with C27 3-beta-HSD deficiency deficiency and
identified 12 different mutations in the HSD3B7 gene (see, e.g.,
607764.0001-607764.0005). They studied 10 mutations in detail; these
were shown to cause complete loss of enzyme activity and, in 2 cases,
alterations in the size or amount of the transcribed RNA. Mutations were
homozygous in 13 patients from 10 families and heterozygous in 4
patients from 3 families. Cheng et al. (2003) concluded that a diverse
spectrum of HSD3B7 mutations underlies this rare form of neonatal
cholestasis.

BILE ACID SYNTHESIS DEFECT, CONGENITAL, 1
HSD3B7, 2-BP DEL, NT1057

In a Saudi Arabian boy with neonatal progressive intrahepatic
cholestasis (607765), the fifth child of consanguineous parents in the
family originally described by Clayton et al. (1987), Schwarz et al.
(2000) identified a 2-bp deletion in exon 6 of the HSD3B7 gene. This
mutation was found in homozygosity and was not present in 25 healthy
controls. It was predicted to shift the translational reading frame,
causing premature termination and the removal of 23 amino acids from the
carboxy terminus of the protein. In vitro studies showed that the
protein carrying the 2-bp deletion prevented the production of enzyme
capable of isomerizing and oxidizing the 7-alpha-hydroxylated forms of
24-hydroxycholesterol, 25-hydroxycholesterol, and 27-hydroxycholesterol.

Cheng et al. (2003) confirmed this mutation in the family of Clayton et
al. (1987) and found it in a second consanguineous Saudi family. They
determined that the 1057deltaCT mutation gives rise to a protein in
which the first 346 amino acids of the normal protein are fused to a
5-residue extension. The mutation was found to produce mRNAs that were
similar in size and amount to those derived from the normal gene but
failed to encode an active enzyme when introduced into HEK293 cells. It
was not known whether inactivation resulted from elimination of the
normal C-terminal sequences or addition of the spurious residues.

In a Chilean family with neonatal cholestasis caused by C27 3-beta-HSD
deficiency (607765), Cheng et al. (2003) found a deletion of a C
nucleotide at position 310 in exon 1 of the HSD3B7 gene.

.0003
BILE ACID SYNTHESIS DEFECT, CONGENITAL, 1

In a French family with neonatal cholestasis caused by C27 3-beta-HSD
deficiency (607765), Cheng et al. (2003) found a splice junction
mutation in intron 2 of the HSD3B7 gene, 340+1G-T.

.0004
BILE ACID SYNTHESIS DEFECT, CONGENITAL, 1
HSD3B7, GLU147LYS

In 2 French families with neonatal cholestasis caused by C27 3-beta-HSD
deficiency (607765), Cheng et al. (2003) found a missense mutation in
HSD3B7, glu147 to lys (E147K). The amino acid substitution resulted from
a G-to-A transition in exon 4. Although an apparently stable mRNA of
normal abundance was transcribed from the mutant gene, no enzyme
activity was detected in transfected cells. Glutamate-147 is conserved
among all members of the 3-beta-HSD enzyme family in human, mouse, and
rat.

In a British and a Canadian family with neonatal cholestasis caused by
C27 3-beta-HSD deficiency (607765), Cheng et al. (2003) found deletion
of AG at nucleotide 63 in exon 1 of the HSD3B7 gene.

607668	TITLE *607668 ADP-RIBOSYLATION-LIKE FACTOR 6-INTERACTING PROTEIN 4; ARL6IP4
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Sasahara et al. (2000) cloned novel mouse and human cDNAs, which they
designated SR-25, from insulinoma cDNA libraries. The deduced human
218-amino acid protein shares 77.7% sequence identity with the mouse
homolog and contains a serine-arginine (SR) repeat and 2 types of amino
acid clusters: a serine cluster and a highly basic cluster. Northern
blot analysis detected expression in all mouse tissues tested, with
abundant expression in testis and thymus. Based on the structure and
expression pattern of SR-25, Sasahara et al. (2000) suggested that the
protein is localized in the nucleus and may contribute to RNA splicing.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the ARL6IP4
gene to chromosome 12 (TMAP stSG29931).

;;TRANSLOCON-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN, BETA;;
TRAP-BETA
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

In order to translocate membrane or secretory proteins across the
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, the signal sequence of a nascent
peptide is recognized by a signal recognition particle (SRP), by which
the nascent peptide associated with a ribosome can bind to the ER
membrane receptor (or docking protein). The SRP is released from both
the ribosome and the signal sequence; the latter lies near an integral,
glycosylated ER membrane protein referred to as the signal sequence
receptor (SSR). The SSR consists of 2 subunits: a 34-kD glycoprotein,
alpha-SSR (SSR1; 600868), and a 22-kD glycoprotein, beta-SSR (SSR2)
(summary by Chinen et al., 1995).

CLONING

Chinen et al. (1995) isolated a human cDNA clone homologous to the
canine beta-SSR gene. Northern blot analysis revealed ubiquitous
expression of beta-SSR in all organs examined.

MAPPING

By FISH, Chinen et al. (1995) mapped the SSR2 gene to chromosome
1q21-q23.

603501	TITLE *603501 POLY(ADP-RIBOSE) GLYCOHYDROLASE; PARG
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The synthesis and rapid turnover of ADP-ribose polymers is an immediate
cellular response to DNA damage. Once synthesized by PARP (173870),
polymers are rapidly turned over and converted to free ADP-ribose by the
action of poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG).

CLONING

By PCR with degenerate primers based on the partial protein sequence of
bovine PARG, Lin et al. (1997) isolated bovine PARG cDNAs. The protein
had a calculated molecular mass of 111 kD, nearly twice the size of the
59-kD enzymatically active PARG isolated from bovine thymus. Using an
activity gel assay of extracts from bacteria expressing PARG, the
authors determined that cDNA encoded proteins of approximately 115 and
59 kD. The larger protein was sensitive to proteolysis, yielding a
protein of approximately 59 kD. The enzymatically active 59-kD PARG
corresponded to the C-terminal portion of the protein. The authors
suggested that proteolysis explains the presence of PARG activity with a
molecular mass of approximately 74 and 59 kD in bovine thymus
preparations, and previous reports of a 74-kD PARG in guinea pig liver
and human placenta. Using the sequence of the bovine cDNA, they searched
sequence databases and identified human and rat PARG cDNAs.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Slade et al. (2011) showed that filamentous fungi and a number of
bacteria possess a divergent form of PARG that has all the main
characteristics of the human PARG enzyme. Slade et al. (2011) presented
the first PARG crystal structure (derived from the bacterium
Thermomonospora curvata), which revealed that the PARG catalytic domain
is a distant member of the ubiquitous ADP-ribose-binding macrodomain
family. High-resolution structures of T. curvata PARG in complexes with
ADP-ribose and the PARG inhibitor ADP-HPD, complemented by biochemical
studies, allowed the authors to propose a model for PAR binding and
catalysis by PARG.

GENE FUNCTION

The poly(ADP ribose) polymerase PARP1 (173870) and the apoptosis factor
AIF (AIFM1; 300169) are members of an apoptotic signaling cascade.
Andrabi et al. (2006) and Yu et al. (2006) demonstrated that PARP1
activity induces cell death through its product, poly(ADP ribose) (PAR)
polymer. Andrabi et al. (2006) showed that degradation of PAR polymer by
Parg or phosphodiesterase-1 (see PDE1A, 171890) prevented PAR
polymer-induced cell death in cultured neurons, and increased Parg
expression in mice reduced damage caused by ischemia following middle
cerebral artery occlusion. Yu et al. (2006) showed that Parg prevented
Parp1-dependent Aif release from mitochondria in mouse cortical neurons
and prevented its accumulation in nuclei.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Ame et al. (1999) mapped the PARG
gene to human chromosome 10q11.23 and mouse chromosome 14B.

ANIMAL MODEL

Hanai et al. (2004) described a loss-of-function mutant in Drosophila.
The mutant lacked the conserved catalytic domain of poly(ADP-ribose)
glycohydrolase and was associated with lethality in the larval stages at
the normal development temperature of 25 degrees centigrade. However,
one-fourth of the mutants progressed to adult stage at 29 degrees
centigrade but showed progressive neurodegeneration with reduced
locomotor activity and a short life span. In association with this,
extensive accumulation of poly(ADP-ribose) could be detected in the
central nervous system. These results suggested that poly(ADP-ribose)
metabolism is required for maintenance of the normal function of
neuronal cells. Hanai et al. (2004) suggested that the phenotypes
observed in the Parg mutant might be useful to understand
neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer and Parkinson disease,
which are caused by abnormal accumulation of substances in nerve tissue.

123680	TITLE *123680 CRYSTALLIN, GAMMA-C; CRYGC
;;CRYSTALLIN, GAMMA-3; CRYG3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The crystallin proteins alpha (see 123660), beta (see 123610), and gamma
account for more than 90% of total lens proteins. Different
gamma-crystallin isoforms account for approximately one-third of total
lens proteins (Bloemendal et al., 2004).

GENE STRUCTURE

Den Dunnen et al. (1985) isolated a genomic cosmid clone containing 2
closely linked gamma-crystallin genes (CRYGC and CRYGB; 123670) oriented
in the same direction. Both genes contain 3 exons. Den Dunnen et al.
(1985) sequenced the coding regions of the genes as well as their
5-prime and 3-prime flanking regions. The genes share 80% homology.

MAPPING

Shiloh et al. (1986) localized the gamma-crystallin genes to 2q33-q36,
most probably 2q34-q35, by Southern analysis of DNA from somatic cell
hybrids and by in situ hybridization.

GENE FUNCTION

The alpha-crystallin subunits alpha-A (123580) and alpha-B (123590) each
can form an oligomer by itself or with the other. Fu and Liang (2002)
used a 2-hybrid system to study heterogeneous interactions among lens
crystallins of different classes. They found interactions between
alpha-A- (or alpha-B-) and beta-B2- (123620) or gamma-C-crystallins, but
the intensity of interaction was one-third that of alpha-A-alpha-B
interactions. HSP27 (602195), a member of the small heat-shock protein
family, showed similar interaction properties with alpha-B-crystallin.
Experiments with N- and C-terminal domain-truncated mutants demonstrated
that both N- and C-terminal domains were important in alpha-A-crystallin
self-interaction, but that only the C-terminal domain was important in
alpha-B-crystallin self-interaction.

Fu and Liang (2003) studied the effect of crystallin gene mutations that
result in congenital cataract on protein-protein interactions.
Interactions between mutated crystallins alpha-A (R116C; 123580.0001),
alpha-B (R120G; 123590.0001), and gamma-C (T5P; 123680.0001) and the
corresponding wildtype proteins, as well as with wildtype
beta-B2-crystallin and HSP27, were analyzed in a mammalian cell 2-hybrid
system. For mutated alpha-A-crystallin, interactions with wildtype
beta-B2-crystallin and gamma-C-crystallin decreased and those with
wildtype alpha-B-crystallin and HSP27 increased. For mutated
alpha-B-crystallin, the interactions with wildtype alpha-A-crystallin
and alpha-B-crystallin decreased, but those with wildtype
beta-B2-crystallin and gamma-C-crystallin increased slightly. For
mutated gamma-C-crystallin, most of the interactions were decreased. The
results indicated that crystallin mutations involved in congenital
cataracts alter protein-protein interactions, which might contribute to
decreased protein solubility and formation of cataract.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a family with Coppock-like cataract (CTRCT2; 604307), originally
reported by Harman (1910) and shown to be linked to the gamma-crystallin
gene family on chromosome 2q by Lubsen et al. (1987), Heon et al. (1999)
identified a heterozygous mutation in the CRYGC gene (T5P; 123680.0001).

In affected members of a family with autosomal dominant variable zonular
pulverulent cataract, Ren et al. (2000) identified a 5-bp duplication in
exon 2 of the CRYGC gene (123680.0002).

In a mother and 2 children with congenital lamellar cataract, Santhiya
et al. (2002) identified a heterozygous missense mutation in the CRYGC
gene (R168W; 123680.0003).

In 6 affected individuals from a 4-generation Mexican family segregating
autosomal dominant nuclear cataract, Gonzalez-Huerta et al. (2007)
identified heterozygosity for the R168W CRYGC mutation, previously
identified in an Indian family with lamellar cataract (Santhiya et al.,
2002).

In a 4-generation Chinese family with autosomal dominant nuclear
cataract and microcornea, Zhang et al. (2009) identified a heterozygous
nonsense mutation in the CRYGC gene (W157X; 123680.0004) that segregated
fully with disease in the family.

In a 4-generation Chinese family segregating autosomal dominant nuclear
cataract and microcornea, Guo et al. (2012) identified heterozygosity
for a W157X mutation in the CRYGC gene (123680.0005) in affected family
members. The substitution was caused by a different nucleotide change
from that identified by Zhang et al. (2009), which also resulted in a
W157X substitution (123680.0004).

In an 8-year-old Chinese girl with congenital nuclear cataract, Li et
al. (2012) identified heterozygosity for a missense mutation in the
CRYGC gene (G129C; 123680.0006). The mutation was present in her
affected mother and maternal grandfather, but was not found in
unaffected family members or in 50 controls. In a zebrafish model, the
G129C mutant recapitulated the human cataract phenotype.

ANIMAL MODEL

Li et al. (2012) generated zebrafish embryos overexpressing
gamma-C-crystallin G129C mutant mRNA and observed obvious vacuoles in
83% of the mutant embryos at 28 hours post fertilization (hpf), compared
to 4% of zebrafish embryos injected with wildtype CRYGC mRNA. At 2 days
postfertilization (dpf), the lens and eyes of G129C mutant embryos
appeared relatively smaller than those expressing wildtype CRYGC, and at
3 to 4 dpf, there was marked opacity and roughness in the lens core of
mutant zebrafish compared to wildtype. Apart from ocular abnormalities,
no other developmental defects were observed in injected embryos.
Histologic examination demonstrated that lens fiber cell nuclei were
still present at 3 dpf and 4 dpf, indicating incomplete denucleation. In
situ hybridization revealed that 2 lens markers, CX23 and LIM2.3, were
significantly downregulated at 28 hpf in mutant embryos compared to
wildtype.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CATARACT 2, COPPOCK-LIKE
CRYGC, THR5PRO

In the original family diagnosed with Coppock-like cataract (CTRCT2;
604307) and shown to be linked to the gamma-crystallin gene family on
chromosome 2q, Heon et al. (1999) identified an A-to-C transversion in
exon 2 (nucleotide 225) of the CRYGC gene, resulting in a thr5-to-pro
substitution. Brakenhoff et al. (1994) had suggested that reactivation
of the CRYG5 (or crystallin-gamma-E pseudogene; 123660) and concomitant
overexpression of the gamma-crystallin fragment may be the cause of
Coppock-like cataract. However, the findings of Heon et al. (1999)
suggested that the reported sequence changes in the CRYG5 promoter
region are not causally related to cataract.

Fu and Liang (2003) observed that gamma-C-crystallin carrying the T5P
mutation had decreased interactions with wildtype gamma-C-crystallin and
alpha-A-, alpha-B-, and beta-B2-crystallins. Interactions between T5P
mutants themselves were unchanged versus wildtype gamma-C-crystallins,
indicating that homogeneous interaction sites or domains differ from
those used in heterogeneous interactions.

.0002
CATARACT 2, ZONULAR PULVERULENT
CRYGC, 5-BP DUP, NT226

In affected members of a family with autosomal dominant variable zonular
pulverulent cataract (CTRCT2; 604307), Ren et al. (2000) found a
heterozygous 5-bp duplication in exon 2 of the CRYGC gene. The
duplicated sequence was GCGGC, located between nucleotides 220 and 230
of the cDNA. Affected persons were heterozygous. The range of severity
of cataract in this kindred varied from a subtle unilateral zonular
pulverulent cataract not impairing visual function to dense bilateral
nuclear cataracts resulting in blindness. Detailed clinical findings of
affected individuals were previously reported by Scott et al. (1994).

.0003
CATARACT 2, MULTIPLE TYPES
CRYGC, ARG168TRP

In a mother and 2 children with congenital lamellar cataract (CTRCT2;
604307), Santhiya et al. (2002) observed a 502C-T transition in exon 3
of the CRYGC gene, leading to an arg168-to-trp (R168W) amino acid
change. Although there was consanguinity in the family, the mutation was
present in heterozygous state in the family of Indian descent.

In 6 affected individuals from a 4-generation Mexican family segregating
autosomal dominant nuclear cataract, Gonzalez-Huerta et al. (2007)
identified heterozygosity for the R168W in the CRYGC gene. The mutation
was not found in unaffected family members or in 170 controls.

.0004
CATARACT 2, NUCLEAR, WITH MICROCORNEA
CRYGC, TRP157TER, 470G-A

In affected members of a 4-generation Chinese family with autosomal
dominant nuclear cataract and microcornea (CTRCT2; 604307), Zhang et al.
(2009) identified heterozygosity for a c.470G-A transition in exon 3 of
the CRYGC gene, resulting in a trp157-to-ter (W157X) substitution at a
highly conserved residue. The mutation was not found in unaffected
family members or in 100 control individuals. Also see 123680.0005.

.0005
CATARACT 2, NUCLEAR, WITH MICROCORNEA
CRYGC, TRP157TER, 471G-A

In affected members of a 4-generation Chinese family segregating
autosomal dominant nuclear cataract and microcornea (CTRCT2; 604307),
Guo et al. (2012) identified heterozygosity for a c.471G-A transition in
exon 3 of the CRYGC gene, resulting in a W157X substitution. The
mutation was not found in unaffected family members or in 100 ethnically
matched controls. Also see 123680.0004.

.0006
CATARACT 2, NUCLEAR
CRYGC, GLY129CYS

In affected members of a 3-generation Chinese family with nuclear
cataract (CTRCT2; 604307), Li et al. (2012) identified heterozygosity
for a c.385G-T transversion in exon 3 of the CRYGC gene, resulting in a
gly129-to-cys (G129C) substitution at a highly conserved residue. The
mutation was not found in unaffected family members or in 50 controls.
In a zebrafish model, the G129C mutant recapitulated the human cataract
phenotype. Molecular modeling and spectroscopic studies indicated that
the mutation impairs the tertiary structure of the protein by modifying
the H-bonding network in the C-terminal domain. The G129C mutant caused
a dramatic decrease in the thermal stability of gamma-C-crystallin as
well as a significant increase in the propensity for aggregation when
subject to high concentrations, heat, and UV-irradiation stresses.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

FGF2 (134920) is a highly conserved, multifunctional heparin-binding
growth factor involved in neuroectoderm development, angiogenesis, and
wound healing. Elevated levels of FGF2 are associated with proliferation
of smooth muscle in atherosclerosis and with proliferation of tumors.
The FGF2 antisense gene, NUDT6, may regulate FGF2 expression.

CLONING

By analyzing sequences of the reverse complement of FGF2 cDNA for
homology to frog Fgf2-antisense, followed by RT-PCR, Murphy and Knee
(1994) obtained a cDNA encoding NUDT6, which they called GFG1. The
deduced 150-amino acid GFG1 protein is 74% identical to the frog
antisense protein. Northern blot analysis revealed expression of a
1.5-kb GFG1 transcript in breast cancer cells, but expression was not
detected in gliomas. Ubiquitous expression of Gfg1 was found in rat
tissues. RT-PCR analysis detected increasing FGF2 levels, but not GFGF1
levels, in glioma cells with increasing cell density, suggesting
independent transcription of the 2 factors. Murphy and Knee (1994)
concluded that there is an inverse relationship between FGF2 and GFG1
expression, indicating that the antisense transcript may regulate FGF2
expression in mammalian tissues.

By screening a Jurkat cDNA library, Gagnon et al. (1999) identified 2
FGF2AS cDNAs encoding splice variants. Using RT-PCR analysis, they
observed that peripheral blood T lymphocytes and T-cell lines
predominantly express FGF2AS, whereas hepatoma cells preferentially
express FGF2. Primer extension analysis of the promoter region of FGF2AS
detected no TATA or CCAAT boxes but found 2 SP1 (189906)-binding sites
and sequences for ETS (see 605255), GATA (see GATA4; 600576), and LYF1
(ZNFN1A1; 603023) transcription factors. Luciferase analysis of mutant
promoters showed that ETS-like transcription factors are most prominent
in the regulation of T-cell FGF2AS expression.

GENE FUNCTION

Asa et al. (2001) showed that human pituitary tumors express FGF2 and
GFG. While normal pituitary expressed GFG but not FGF2, pituitary
adenomas expressed FGF2 and had reduced levels of GFG; aggressive and
recurrent adenomas expressed more FGF2 than GFG mRNA. Transiently and
stably transfected cells expressed the 35-kD GFG protein, which was
localized to the cytoplasm. These cells exhibited enhanced prolactin
(176760) expression. The authors concluded that the GFG protein has
divergent hormone-regulatory and antiproliferative actions in the
pituitary that are independent of FGF2 expression and that GFG
represents a novel mechanism involved in restraining pituitary tumor
cell growth while promoting hormonal activity.

GENE STRUCTURE

Gagnon et al. (1999) determined that the FGF2AS gene contains 5 exons.
Both splice variants use exons 2 through 5 and differ only in the first
exon, either 1a or 1b.

MAPPING

Using YACs, somatic cell hybrid analysis, and radiation hybrid analysis,
Asa et al. (2001) mapped the NUDT6 gene to 4q25-q27, where the FGF2 gene
is localized.
