DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Ribonuclease P (RNase P) removes the 5-prime leader sequences from
precursor tRNA molecules. RNase P consists of an RNA species (H1 RNA),
the POP1 protein (602486), and at least 7 proteins called RPPs. The RPPs
have apparent molecular masses of 14 kD (RPP14; 606112), 20 kD (RPP20;
606113), 25 kD (RPP25), 29 kD (RPP29; 606114), 30 kD (RPP30; 606115), 38
kD (RPP38), and 40 kD (RPP40; 606117). Patients with scleroderma
(181750) have serum reactive with RNase P, the Th antigen, which is also
referred to as the To antigen, and RPP30 and RPP38 (summary by Jarrous
et al., 1998, 1999).

CLONING

By biochemical purification of RNase P, micropeptide sequence analysis,
PCR on a fetal liver cDNA library, and EST database searching, Eder et
al. (1997) obtained a cDNA encoding RPP38. The deduced 283-amino acid
protein has a leucine zipper RNA-binding motif and a predicted molecular
mass of nearly 32 kD, less than the 38 kD observed in SDS-PAGE analysis.

Jarrous et al. (1998) determined that RPP38 is a major target for
antisera from systemic sclerosis patients and that the antigen is likely
to be localized in both the nucleoplasm and nucleolus.
Immunoprecipitation analysis showed that polyclonal antibodies raised
against RPP20, RPP30, RPP38, or RPP40 interact with RNase P from HeLa
cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Following depletion of RNase P from HeLa cell extracts, Reiner et al.
(2006) found a severe deficiency in RNA polymerase (Pol) III (see
606007)-mediated transcription of tRNA and other small noncoding RNA
genes. Targeted cleavage of the H1RNA (RPPH1; 608513) moiety of RNase P
altered enzyme specificity and diminished Pol III transcription.
Similarly, inactivation of RNase P protein subunits, such as RPP38, by
small interfering RNA inhibited Pol III function and Pol III-directed
promoter activity in the cell. RNase P exerted its role in transcription
through association with Pol III and chromatin of active tRNA and 5S
rRNA (180420) genes. Reiner et al. (2006) concluded that RNase P has a
role in Pol III transcription and that transcription and early tRNA
processing may be coordinated.

MAPPING

Gross (2013) mapped the RPP38 gene to chromosome 10p13 based on an
alignment of the RPP38 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC029494) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).
