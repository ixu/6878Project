DESCRIPTION There are 4 classes of murine leukemia virus (MLV): xenotropic (X),
ecotropic (E), amphotropic (A), and polytropic (P). X- and E-MLV cannot
exogenously infect mouse cells and are inherited as part of the mouse
genome. While X-MLV can infect other mammalian species but not cells
from laboratory mice, A- (see SLC20A2; 158378) and P-MLV can infect
mouse and other species. See Levy (1999) for a review of MLVs.

By cloning a human T-lymphocyte cDNA library into a retroviral vector,
transducing the library into naturally X-MLV-resistant mouse
fibroblasts, and PCR amplification, Tailor et al. (1999) isolated a cDNA
encoding XPR1. Expression of XPR1 in mouse and hamster MLV-resistant
fibroblasts rendered the cells susceptible to both X- and P-MLV. The
deduced 696-amino acid XPR1 protein contains 8 or 9 potential
membrane-spanning regions, 7 potential N-glycosylation sites, and 7
dileucines that may stimulate endocytosis via clathrin-coated pits.
Northern blot analysis detected a 4.5-kb XPR1 transcript in all tissues
tested, with highest expression in pancreas, kidney, placenta,
hematopoietic tissues, and heart, and lowest expression in skeletal
muscle. Expression of XPR1 was greater in fetal liver than adult liver.
A 9.5-kb XPR1 transcript was also detected in all tissues tested except
liver and bone marrow.

Using methods similar to those of Tailor et al. (1999), Battini et al.
(1999) isolated a cDNA encoding XPR1. Sequence analysis predicted that
XPR1, which shares 25% amino acid identity with the yeast Syg1 protein,
contains a 236-amino acid, hydrophilic N-terminal region that precedes
the 8 hydrophobic domains.

By radiation hybrid analysis, Battini et al. (1999) mapped the XPR1 gene
to 1q25.1, flanked by the AT3 (107300) and LAMC1 (150290) genes. Yang et
al. (1999) and Tailor et al. (1999) mapped the mouse Xpr1 gene, also
called Rmc1, to chromosome 1.
