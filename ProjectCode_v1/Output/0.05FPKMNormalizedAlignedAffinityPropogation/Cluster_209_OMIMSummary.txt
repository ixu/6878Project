608172	TITLE *608172 DEHYDRODOLICHYL DIPHOSPHATE SYNTHASE; DHDDS
;;DEDOL-PP SYNTHASE;;
HDS
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Dehydrodolichyl diphosphate (dedol-PP) synthase catalyzes cis-prenyl
chain elongation to produce the polyprenyl backbone of dolichol, a
glycosyl carrier lipid required for the biosynthesis of several classes
of glycoproteins (summary by Endo et al., 2003).

CLONING

By searching databases for sequences similar to E. coli undecaprenyl
diphosphate synthase (UPS) and S. cerevisiae dedol-PP synthase, followed
by RT-PCR of a testis cDNA library, Endo et al. (2003) cloned DHDDS,
which they designated HDS. The deduced 333-amino acid DHDDS protein
contains all 5 regions conserved among cis-prenyl chain-elongating
enzymes in several eukaryotic and prokaryotic species. DHDDS shares
41.8% homology with yeast dedol-PP synthase and 37.6% homology with E.
coli UPS. Northern blot analysis detected high DHDDS expression in
testis and kidney, with lower levels in heart, spleen, and thymus.

Zelinger et al. (2011) performed RT-PCR analysis in 21 human tissues and
observed ubiquitous expression of DHDDS, with a band of higher intensity
in the retinal sample compare to other tissues. The analysis confirmed
the expression of the full-length transcript in the retina as well as 3
alternatively spliced variants, 2 of which were in-frame and likely to
encode a protein.

GENE STRUCTURE

Endo et al. (2003) determined that the DHDDS gene contains 8 coding
exons and spans more than 37 kb. Zelinger et al. (2011) noted that the
DHDDS gene contains 9 exons and that exon 1 is noncoding.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Endo et al. (2003) mapped the DHDDS gene
to chromosome 1p35.

By genomic sequence analysis, Zelinger et al. (2011) mapped the DHDDS
gene to chromosome 1p36.11.

GENE FUNCTION

By in vitro assay, Endo et al. (2003) demonstrated cis-prenyltransferase
activity in DHDDS-transformed yeast membrane fractions incubated with
radiolabeled isopentenyl diphosphate and farnesyl diphosphate as
substrates. Thin-layer chromatography detected synthesis of high levels
of dolichols with major chain lengths of C90, C95, and C100, consistent
with dolichols isolated from human tissues.

Zelinger et al. (2011) performed immunohistochemical analysis of the
human retina with anti-DHDDS antibodies and observed intense labeling of
the cone and rod photoreceptor inner segments.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 3 affected sibs from an Ashkenazi Jewish family with retinitis
pigmentosa (RP59; 613861), in whom mutation in all known RP genes had
been excluded, Zuchner et al. (2011) performed whole-exome sequencing
and identified homozygosity for a missense mutation in the DDHS gene
(K42E; 608172.0001) that was not present in their unaffected sib. The
unaffected parents were heterozygous for the mutation, which was
detected in heterozygosity in 8 of 717 Ashkenazi Jewish controls but was
not found in 6,977 confirmed non-Ashkenazi white controls; the variant
was also found once in 5,893 additional white controls for whom
genomewide genotype data were not available. Zuchner et al. (2011)
stated that E42K likely arose from an ancestral founder.

In 15 (12%) of 123 Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) probands with RP, Zelinger et
al. (2011) identified homozygosity for the K42E founder mutation. The
K42E mutation was found in heterozygosity in 1 of 322 ethnically matched
controls, indicating a carrier frequency of 0.3% in the AJ population,
but was not detected in an additional set of 109 AJ patients with RP, in
20 AJ patients with other inherited retinal diseases, or in 70 patients
with retinal degeneration of other ethnic origins.

ANIMAL MODEL

By morpholino-knockdown of Dhdds in zebrafish, Zuchner et al. (2011)
observed failure to exhibit the typical escape response to light on-off
switches, and microscopic examination of the morphant retina revealed
that photoreceptor outer segments were very short or completely missing;
in addition, one-third of zebrafish morphants had smaller eyes and a
slight ventral flexion to the body axis.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
RETINITIS PIGMENTOSA 59
DHDDS, LYS42GLU

In 3 affected sibs from an Ashkenazi Jewish family with retinitis
pigmentosa (RP59; 613861), Zuchner et al. (2011) identified homozygosity
for a 124A-G transition in exon 3 of the DHDDS gene, resulting in a
lys42-to-glu (K42E) substitution at a highly conserved residue located
close to the catalytic center and the substrate binding site for
farnesyl phosphate. The unaffected parents were heterozygous for the
mutation, which was also detected in heterozygosity in 8 of 717
Ashkenazi Jewish controls but not found in 6,977 confirmed non-Ashkenazi
white controls; the variant was also found once in 5,893 additional
white controls for whom genomewide genotype data were not available.

In 20 Ashkenazi Jewish patients with RP from 15 families, Zelinger et
al. (2011) identified homozygosity for the E42K founder mutation in exon
3 of the DHDDS gene.

609249	TITLE *609249 HECT DOMAIN AND RCC1-LIKE DOMAIN 6; HERC6
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

HERC6 belongs to the HERC family of ubiquitin ligases, all of which
contain a HECT domain and at least 1 RCC1 (179710)-like domain (RLD).
The 350-amino acid HECT domain is predicted to catalyze the formation of
a thioester with ubiquitin before transferring it to a substrate, and
the RLD is predicted to act as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for
small G proteins (Hochrainer et al., 2005).

CLONING

Hochrainer et al. (2005) cloned a partial HERC6 cDNA from an endothelial
cell cDNA library and obtained the full-length sequence by 5-prime and
3-prime RACE. The deduced 1,022-amino acid protein contains an
N-terminal RLD and a C-terminal HECT domain. Hochrainer et al. (2005)
identified several alternatively spliced HERC6 transcripts in the human
Jurkat T-cell line, in human skin microvascular endothelial cells, and
in HeLa cells. Most of these splicing events cause frameshifts,
resulting in truncated proteins containing only the RLD. Confocal
immunofluorescence microscopy of transiently transfected HeLa cells
showed HERC6 in a punctate cytoplasmic distribution.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hochrainer et al. (2005) determined that the HERC6 gene contains 23
exons, with the initiation codon in exon 1.

MAPPING

Using somatic cell hybridization, Hochrainer et al. (2005) mapped the
HERC6 gene to chromosome 4. By genomic sequence analysis, they
determined that HERC3 (605200), HERC5 (608242), and HERC6 are clustered
within a 330-kb region on chromosome 4q22. HERC6 and HERC5 are separated
by 14 kb, and HERC5 and HERC3 are separated by 86 kb.

139160	TITLE *139160 GUANINE NUCLEOTIDE-BINDING PROTEIN, ALPHA Z POLYPEPTIDE; GNAZ
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By cDNA cloning, Blatt et al. (1988) identified a G protein-encoding
gene which they called G(z-alpha) and symbolized GNAZ. The corresponding
protein was found to differ strikingly from other G-alpha subunits in
amino acid sequence in a number of regions, and it appeared to be highly
enriched in neural tissue (Fong et al., 1988; Matsuoka et al., 1988).

MAPPING

Blatt et al. (1988) assigned the GNAZ locus to chromosome 22 by
hybridization to the DNA from a panel of rodent-human cell hybrids. By
in situ hybridization, Wilkie et al. (1992) demonstrated that the GNAZ
gene is located in band 22q11. By the analysis of RFLVs in an
interspecific backcross, they showed that the corresponding gene is
located on mouse chromosome 10. Budarf et al. (1991) further narrowed
the localization to 22q11.2 by fluorescence in situ hybridization on
reverse banded metaphase chromosomes. They confirmed the localization by
means of a regional mapping panel of somatic cell hybrids.

BRUNO-LIKE 2; BRUNOL2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the CELF family, such as CELF1, play various roles in
cotranscriptional and posttranscriptional RNA processing. All CELF
proteins appear to affect pre-mRNA splicing, but individual CELFs have
divergent roles in regulating mRNA stability and translation (summary by
Wagnon et al., 2012).

CLONING

An unstable CTG triplet repeat expansion in the DMPK gene (605377) is
responsible for myotonic dystrophy (DM1; 160900). To detect proteins
that bind to CTG triplet repeats, Timchenko et al. (1996) performed
bandshift analysis using as probes double-stranded DNA fragments having
CTG repeats and single-stranded oligonucleotides having CTG repeats or
RNA CUG repeats. The proteins were derived from nuclear and cytoplasmic
extracts of HeLa cells, fibroblasts, and myotubes. Proteins binding to
the double-stranded DNA repeat were inhibited by the nonlabeled repeat
but not by a nonspecific DNA fragment. Another protein binding to the
single-stranded CTG probe and the RNA CUG probe was inhibited by
nonlabeled CTG(8) and CUG(8) repeats. The protein binding only to the
RNA repeat (CUG)8 was inhibited by nonlabeled (CUG)8 but not by
nonlabeled single- or double-stranded CTG repeats. Furthermore, the
protein, designated CUG-binding protein (CUGBP) by the authors,
exhibited no binding to an RNA oligonucleotide of triplet repeats of the
same length but having a different sequence, CGG. The CUG-binding
protein was localized to the cytoplasm, whereas double-stranded DNA
binding proteins were localized to the nuclear extract. Thus, Timchenko
et al. (1996) concluded that several trinucleotide-binding proteins
exist and their specificity is determined by the triplet sequence.

CTG trinucleotide repeats encode CUG repeat regions in the corresponding
mRNAs. Timchenko et al. (1996) identified 2 proteins, termed CUGBP1 and
CUGBP2, that bind specifically to CUG repeats in RNA. They suggested
that these 2 proteins, with masses of 49 kD and 51 kD, respectively, are
isoforms encoded by the same gene. Timchenko et al. (1996) cloned a
gene, termed NAB50 by them, based on the interaction between its protein
product and the yeast Nab2 protein. The authors stated that the NAB50
gene encodes the CUGBP1 and CUGBP2 proteins because anti-Nab50
antibodies crossreacted with both CUGBP isoforms. The gene predicts a
482-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 52 kD. The
predicted protein contains 3 RNA-binding domains and is homologous to
the hnRNPs.

Good et al. (2000) identified CUGBP1 as BRUNOL2, a member of a human
gene family related to the transcriptional regulator 'Bruno' of
Drosophila. By PCR, they cloned BRUNOL2 from a brain cDNA library. The
deduced protein contains 2 N-terminal RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), a
long linker region, and a C-terminal RRM. BRUNOL2 and BRUNOL3 (CUGBP2;
602538) share 80% amino acid identity overall and more than 92% identity
in their RRMs. Good et al. (2000) determined that the BRUNOL2 cDNA and
the CUGBP1 cDNA reported by Timchenko et al. (1996) differ in their
3-prime UTRs due to alternative splicing. Good et al. (2000) also
identified a BRUNOL2 splice variant with an additional 12 bp, resulting
in a 4-amino acid insertion in the linker region. Northern blot analysis
detected variable expression of 3 major BRUNOL2 transcripts of about
9.5, 7.5, and 2.4 kb in all tissues examined.

Using RNA dot blot analysis, Ladd et al. (2004) confirmed ubiquitous
expression of CUGBP1.

GENE FUNCTION

Timchenko et al. (1996) showed that the NAB50 gene product bound the CUG
repeat region of DMPK.

Using 2 biologic systems with reduced DMPK levels, a homozygous DM
patient and DMPK knockout mice, Roberts et al. (1997) demonstrated that
the intracellular distribution of CUGBP isoforms was altered in the
absence of DMPK. DMPK phosphorylated the CUGBP protein in vitro,
suggesting regulation of nuclear CUGBP localization via phosphorylation.

Using ultraviolet light crosslinking and gel mobility shift assays, Good
et al. (2000) showed that BRUNOL2 bound RNA containing a BRUNO response
element (BRE).

Dudaronek et al. (2007) showed that Ifnb (147720) induced expression of
Lip, a truncated, dominant-negative isoform of Cebpb (189965), and
suppressed active simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) replication in
macaque macrophages. In a human monocyte cell line, IFNB induced
phosphorylation of CUGBP1 and formation of CUGBP1-CEBPB mRNA complexes.
Depletion of Cugbp1 in macaque macrophages via small interfering RNA
showed that Cugbp1 was required for Ifnb-mediated induction of Lip and
for Ifnb-mediated suppression of SIV replication. Dudaronek et al.
(2007) concluded that CUGBP1 is a downstream effector of IFNB signaling
in primary macrophages that plays an important role in innate immune
responses controlling acute human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or SIV
replication in brain.

A transgenic fly model of fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome
(FXTAS; 300623) in which the 5-prime UTR of human FMR1 (309550)
containing 90 CGG repeats is expressed specifically in the eye results
in disorganized ommatidia, depigmentation, and progressive loss of
photoreceptor neurons. Sofola et al. (2007) found that overexpression of
human CUGBP1 suppressed the neurodegenerative eye phenotype in
transgenic flies. CUGBP1 did not interact directly with the CGG repeats,
but did so via HNRNPA2B1 (600124). Expression of the A2 isoform of human
HNRNPA2B1, or the Drosophila orthologs, also suppressed the eye
phenotype of FXTAS flies. CUGBP1 did not interact with other HNRNPs
examined.

Tang et al. (2012) observed altered splicing of the calcium channel
subunit CAV1.1 (CACNA1S; 114208) in muscle of patients with DM1 and DM2
(602668) compared with normal adult muscle and muscle of patients with
facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD; see 158900). A significant
fraction of CAV1.1 transcripts in DM1 and DM2 muscle showed skipping of
exon 29, which represents a fetal splicing pattern. Forced exclusion of
exon 29 in normal mouse skeletal muscle altered channel gating
properties and increased current density and peak electrically evoked
calcium transient magnitude. Downregulation of Mbnl1 (606516) in mouse
cardiac muscle or overexpression of Cugbp1 in mouse tibialis anterior
muscle enhanced skipping of exon 29, suggesting that these splicing
factors may be involved in the CAV1.1 splicing defect in myotonic
dystrophy.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Good et al. (2000) mapped the CUGBP1 gene
to chromosome 11p11.

ANIMAL MODEL

Wang et al. (2007) generated an inducible and heart-specific mouse model
of DM1 that expressed expanded human DMPK CUG-repeat RNA and
recapitulated pathologic features of the human disorder, including
dilated cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias, and systolic and diastolic
dysfunction. The mice also showed misregulation of developmental
alternative splicing transitions, including the Tnnt2 (191045) and Fxr1
(600819) genes. All died of heart failure within 2 weeks.
Immunohistochemical studies showed increased CUGBP1 protein levels
specifically in nuclei containing foci of DMPK CUG-repeat RNA. A
time-course study showed that increased CUGBP1 cooccurred within hours
of induced expression of the CUG repeat and coincided with reversion to
embryonic splicing patterns. The results indicated that increased CUGBP1
is a specific and early event of DM1 pathogenesis and represents a
primary response to expression of DMPK CUG-repeat mutant RNA.

Koshelev et al. (2010) expressed human CUGBP1 in adult mouse heart.
Upregulation of CUGBP1 was sufficient to reproduce molecular,
histopathologic, and functional changes observed in a DM1 mouse model
that expressed expanded CUG RNA repeats (Wang et al., 2007) as well as
in individuals with DM1. The authors concluded that CUGBP1 upregulation
plays an important role in DM1 pathogenesis.

By inducing expression of human CUGBP1 in adult skeletal muscle of
transgenic mice, Ward et al. (2010) showed that the pathogenic features
of DM1 could be explained by upregulated CUGBP1 expression. Within weeks
of induction of CUGBP1 expression, transgenic mice exhibited impaired
movement, reduced muscle function, abnormal gait, and reduced total body
weight compared with uninduced controls. Histologic analysis of
transgenic muscle overexpressing CUGBP1 revealed centrally located
nuclei, myofiber degeneration with inflammatory infiltrate, and pyknotic
nuclear clumps. RT-PCR analysis revealed reversion to embryonic splicing
patterns in several genes in transgenic muscle overexpressing CUGBP1.
Ward et al. (2010) concluded that CUGBP1 has a major role in DM1
skeletal muscle pathogenesis.

607074	TITLE *607074 PROTEIN KINASE D2; PRKD2
;;PKD2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By EST database searching with the conserved C-terminal sequence of
serine kinases and screening of a human ductal pancreatic cDNA library,
Sturany et al. (2001) cloned a novel serine/threonine protein kinase,
which they called PKD2. The deduced 878-amino acid protein, which has a
predicted molecular mass of 97 kD, contains an N-terminal hydrophobic
area predicted to be a transmembrane region, 2 cysteine-rich motifs that
form zinc finger-like repeats, a pleckstrin homology domain, and a
putative kinase domain containing the ATP-binding consensus sequence. An
invariant aspartate essential for kinase activity is located within a
motif conserved in serine/threonine kinases. The first zinc finger-like
domain shares 88% identity to the corresponding domains in PKD/PKC-mu
(PRKCM; 605435) and PKC-nu (PRKCN; 607077). Northern blot analysis
detected constitutive low expression of a 4-kb transcript; higher levels
were observed in pancreas, heart, lung, smooth muscle, and brain, and
lower levels kidney and liver. SDS-PAGE revealed a protein with a
molecular mass of 105 kD, as did Western blot analysis of endogenous
PRKD2 or protein expressed following transfection.

GENE FUNCTION

Sturany et al. (2001) demonstrated phorbol ester binding to the duplex
zinc finger-like motif of PRKD2 as well as autophosphorylation following
phorbol ester stimulation. The addition of phosphatidyl-L-serine caused
synergistic stimulation. Phorbol ester-activated PRKD2 migrated more
slowly than inactive PRKD2 by SDS-PAGE, suggesting hyperphosphorylation
upon activation.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the PRKD2
gene to chromosome 19 (TMAP R67403).

607281	TITLE *607281 LSM1 PROTEIN; LSM1
;;CANCER-ASSOCIATED SM-LIKE PROTEIN; CASM
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Sm-like proteins, such as LSM1, were identified in a variety of
organisms based on sequence homology with the Sm protein family (see
SNRPD2; 601061). Sm-like proteins contain the Sm sequence motif, which
consists of 2 regions separated by a linker of variable length that
folds as a loop. Sm-like proteins are thought to form a stable heteromer
present in tri-snRNP particles, which are important for pre-mRNA
splicing (Achsel et al., 1999). LSM1 localizes to cytoplasmic processing
bodies (P bodies) involved in mRNA storage, processing, regulation, and
degradation and is required for P-body formation (Scheller et al.,
2007).

CLONING

LSM1 was first isolated from human pancreatic cancers as an upregulated
gene and termed 'cancer-associated Sm-like protein' (CASM) by
Schweinfest et al. (1997). The deduced LSM1 protein contains 133 amino
acids.

In a search for human Sm-like proteins, Achsel et al. (1999)
fractionated proteins present in purified (U4/U6.U5) tri-snRNPs and
isolated 7 Sm-like proteins, which they named LSm2-LSm8. Using partial
peptide sequence for database searches, they identified and sequenced
EST clones. Using additional sequence obtained by PCR amplification of a
HeLa cDNA library, they assembled full-length cDNA sequences for
LSM2-LSM8.

Salgado-Garrido et al. (1999) searched database sequence for Sm proteins
and identified 16 potential Sm-related genes in yeast as well as some
Sm-related genes in human and archaebacteria. Using a multiple sequence
alignment of Sm domains, they built a phylogenetic tree of yeast, human,
and archaeal Sm and Sm-like proteins.

Using Northern blot analysis, Scheller et al. (2007) detected variable
expression of a 0.95-kb LSM1 transcript in all human tissues examined.
In HeLa cells, LSM1 colocalized with PATL1 (614660), DCP1 (see 607010),
and RCK (DDX6; 600326) in cytoplasmic P bodies.

GENE FUNCTION

Using electron-microscopy, Achsel et al. (1999) observed that purified
LSm proteins form a heteromer that is stable even in the absence of RNA
and exhibits a doughnut-shaped structure similar to the Sm core RNP
structure. They demonstrated that the purified LSm heteromer binds
specifically to the U6 snRNA at its 3-prime-terminal U-tract. They also
showed that the LSm proteins facilitate the formation of U4/U6 RNA
duplexes in vitro and concluded that the LSm proteins may play a role in
U4/U6 snRNP formation.

Using immunoprecipitation experiments, Salgado-Garrido et al. (1999)
concluded that there is a complex of 7 Sm-like proteins bound to RNA in
yeast. Lsm2-Lsm8 coprecipitate the U4, U5 and U6 snRNAs and directly
associate with the U6 snRNA present in the free U6 snRNP. Additionally,
the yeast Lsm2-Lsm7 proteins were found to be associated with the
pre-RNase P RNA but not the mature RNase RNA. Using immunoprecipitation
experiments from human cell extracts, Salgado-Garrido et al. (1999)
showed that the LSM3 and LSM4 proteins are specifically associated with
snRNP complexes containing the U6 snRNA. Salgado-Garrido et al. (1999)
concluded that Sm and Sm-like proteins assemble in at least 2
functionally conserved complexes of deep evolutionary origin.

By disrupting the Sm and Sm-like genes in yeast, Salgado-Garrido et al.
(1999) concluded that disruption of genes encoding Sm-like proteins
directly associated with the U6 snRNA (Lsm2-8) generated variable
phenotypes. Lsm2, Lsm3, Lsm4, and Lsm8 are essential for vegetative
growth. Lsm5, Lsm6, and Lsm7 are not essential for growth; however,
their disruptions lead to slow growth especially at elevated
temperature. The levels of the U6 snRNA were strongly reduced in the
strains harboring the Lsm5, Lsm6, and Lsm7 disruptions. Lsm1 and Lsm9
are dispensable for vegetative growth, but Lsm1 is required for optimal
vegetative growth at 30 degrees and is temperature sensitive.

Ingelfinger et al. (2002) determined that human LSM1 to LSM7, but not
LSM8, were expressed in HeLa cells within cytoplasmic foci. The foci
also contained a decapping enzyme (DCP1/2) and the exonuclease XRN1
(607994). Coexpression of wildtype and mutant LSM proteins, as well as
fluorescence resonance energy transfer, indicated that the LSM proteins
form a complex similar to one found in yeast. Ingelfinger et al. (2002)
concluded that the foci contain a partially or fully assembled machinery
for the degradation of mRNA.

Using cDNA-representational difference analysis, Takahashi et al. (2002)
searched for genes differentially expressed in advanced prostate cancers
and thereby isolated the LSM1 gene as 1 that is downregulated. They
transfected an LSM1 expression vector into PC3 cells, which normally
feature downregulated LSM1. In the transfectants, no differences in
morphology or cell proliferation were evident in comparison with parent
PC3 or PC3/mock-transfectants. In contrast, significant suppression of
invasive potential or metastatic ability of LSM1 transfectants was
observed in the Matrigel chemoinvasion assay and in nude mice,
respectively. In studies of human prostate cancers, Takahashi et al.
(2002) found that almost all informative prostatectomized cases without
neoadjuvant therapy showed allelic retention in the LSM1 region, whereas
refractory cancers frequently showed allelic loss in this region. No
critical gene mutations were found in the open reading frame of LSM1 in
prostate cancers, including localized and refractory cancers. These
results suggested that LSM1 is deeply involved in prostate cancer
progression through its downregulation, independent of any gene
mutation.

By array CGH, Yang et al. (2006) analyzed the copy number and expression
level of genes in the 8p12-p11 amplicon in 22 human breast cancer
(114480) specimens and 7 breast cancer cell lines. Of the 21 potential
genes identified, PCR analysis and functional analysis indicated that 3
genes, LSM1, BAG4 (603884), and C8ORF4 (607702), are breast cancer
oncogenes that can work in combination to influence a transformed
phenotype in human mammary epithelial cells.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the LSM1
gene to chromosome 8 (TMAP stSG26021). Most of the genes encoding the
Lsm proteins map to different chromosomes.

601772	TITLE *601772 H2A HISTONE FAMILY, MEMBER X; H2AFX
;;H2AX HISTONE;;
H2AX
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Histones wrap DNA to form nucleosome particles that compact eukaryotic
genomes. Each nucleosome core particle consists of DNA wrapped by an
octamer containing 2 molecules each of the highly conserved histones H2A
(see 613499), H2B (see 609904), H3 (see 602810), and H4 (see 602822). H1
histones (see 142709) occupy the linker DNA between nucleosomes.
Canonical histone genes are clustered in repeat arrays and their
transcription is tightly coupled to DNA replication. In contrast,
noncanonical variant histone genes are found singly in the genome, are
constitutively expressed, and encode histones that differ in primary
amino acid sequence from their canonical paralogs. Unlike canonical
histones that function primarily in genome packaging and gene
regulation, variant histones have roles in DNA repair, meiotic
recombination, chromosome segregation, transcription initiation and
termination, sex chromosome condensation, and sperm chromatin packaging.
H2AFX is variant histone of the H2A family (review by Talbert and
Henikoff, 2010).

For additional background information on histones, histone gene
clusters, and the H2A histone family, see HIST1H2AA (613499).

CLONING

Ivanova et al. (1994) stated that this gene, termed H2A.X by them, is 1
of 3 whose synthesis is not linked to DNA replication. They stated that
H2AX is encoded by an alternatively processed transcript that yields 2
mRNA species, a 0.6-kb stemloop transcript indistinguishable from those
of replication-linked histones, and a 1.6-kb read-through polyadenylated
transcript. Ivanova et al. (1994) noted that the gene encodes a
142-amino acid protein having a unique C-terminal sequence, QASQEY,
which has been conserved from lower eukaryotes.

GENE FUNCTION

Chen et al. (2000) reported that the Nijmegen breakage syndrome protein
(NBS1; 602667) and phosphorylated H2AX (gamma-H2AX), which associate
with irradiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), are also found
at sites of V(D)J (variable, diversity, joining) recombination-induced
DSBs. In developing thymocytes, NBS1 and gamma-H2AX form nuclear foci
that colocalize with the T-cell receptor-alpha (TCRA; see 186880) locus
in response to recombination-activating gene-1 (RAG1; 179615)
protein-mediated V(D)J cleavage. Chen et al. (2000) concluded that their
results suggest that surveillance of T-cell receptor recombination
intermediates by NBS1 and gamma-H2AX may be important for preventing
oncogenic translocations.

Class switch recombination is a region-specific DNA recombination
reaction that replaces one immunoglobulin heavy-chain constant region
gene with another. This enables a single variable region gene to be used
in conjunction with different downstream heavy-chain constant region
genes, each having a unique biologic activity. Activation-induced
cytidine deaminase (AID; 605257), a putative RNA editing enzyme, is
required for this action. Petersen et al. (2001) reported that the NBS1
protein and gamma-H2AX, which facilitate DNA double-strand break repair,
form nuclear foci at the heavy-chain constant region in the G1 phase of
the cell cycle in cells undergoing class switch recombination. Class
switch recombination is impaired in H2AX -/- mice. Localization of NBS1
and gamma-H2AX to the immunoglobulin heavy-chain locus during class
switch recombination is dependent on AID. In addition, AID is required
for induction of switch region-specific DNA lesions that precede class
switch recombination. Petersen et al. (2001) concluded that AID
functions upstream of the DNA modifications that initiate class switch
recombination.

Chowdhury et al. (2005) found that protein phosphatase-2A (PP2A) is
involved in removing gamma-H2AX from DNA foci during double-stranded
break repair. The PP2A catalytic subunit (PPP2CA; 176915) and gamma-H2AX
coimmunoprecipitated from human cell lines and colocalized in DNA damage
foci, and PP2A dephosphorylated gamma-H2AX in vitro. Recruitment of
PPP2CA to DNA damage foci was H2AX dependent. Inhibition of PPP2CA by
RNA interference led to the persistence of gamma-H2AX foci, inefficient
DNA repair, and cells that were hypersensitive to DNA damage.

Gorgoulis et al. (2005) analyzed a panel of human lung hyperplasias, all
of which retained wildtype p53 (191170) genes and had no signs of gross
chromosomal instability, and found signs of a DNA damage response,
including histone H2AX and CHK2 (604373) phosphorylation, p53
accumulation, focal staining of p53 binding protein-1 (53BP1; 605230),
and apoptosis. Progression to carcinoma was associated with p53 or 53BP1
inactivation and decreased apoptosis. A DNA damage response was also
observed in dysplastic nevi and in human skin xenografts, in which
hyperplasia was induced by overexpression of growth factors. Both lung
and experimentally-induced skin hyperplasias showed allelic imbalance at
loci that are prone to DNA double-strand break formation when DNA
replication is compromised (common fragile sites). Gorgoulis et al.
(2005) proposed that, from its earliest stages, cancer development is
associated with DNA replication stress, which leads to DNA double-strand
breaks, genomic instability, and selective pressure for p53 mutations.

By examining immunoglobulin heavy chain (see 147100) class switch
recombination in mouse B-lymphocytes deficient in H2ax, Atm (607585),
53bp1, or Mdc1 (607593), Franco et al. (2006) determined that these
factors promote end joining and thereby prevent DNA double-strand breaks
from progressing into chromosomal breaks and translocations.

Keogh et al. (2006) described a 3-protein complex in S. cerevisiae,
which they called HTP-C for histone H2A phosphatase complex, containing
the phosphatase Pph3 that regulates the phosphorylation status of
gamma-H2AX in vivo and efficiently dephosphorylates gamma-H2AX in vitro.
Gamma-H2AX is lost from chromatin surrounding a double-strand break
independently of the HTP-C, indicating that the phosphatase targets
gamma-H2AX after its displacement from DNA. The dephosphorylation of
gamma-H2AX by the HTP-C is necessary for efficient recovery from the DNA
damage checkpoint.

Using a combination of proteomics, cytology, and functional analysis in
C. elegans, Chu et al. (2006) reduced 1,099 proteins copurified with
spermatogenic chromatin to 132 proteins for functional analysis. This
strategy to find fertility factors conserved from C. elegans to mammals
achieved its goal: of mouse gene knockouts corresponding to nematode
proteins, 37% (7 of 19) cause male sterility. This list includes PPP1CC
(176914), H2AX, SON (182465), TOP1 (126420), DDX4 (605281), DBY
(400010), and CENPC (117141).

GABA(A) receptors signal through S-phase checkpoint kinases of the
phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase-related kinase family and the histone
variant H2AX. This signaling pathway critically regulates proliferation
independently of differentiation, apoptosis, and overt damage to DNA.
Andang et al. (2008) demonstrated that autocrine/paracrine
gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) signaling by means of GABA(A) receptors
negatively controls embryonic stem (ES) cell and peripheral neural crest
stem (NCS) cell proliferation, preimplantation embryonic growth, and
proliferation in the boundary-cap stem cell niche, resulting in an
attenuation of neuronal progenies from this stem cell niche. Activation
of GABA(A) receptors leads to hyperpolarization, increased cell volume,
and accumulation of stem cells in S phase, thereby causing a rapid
decrease in cell proliferation. Andang et al. (2008) concluded that
their results indicated the presence of a fundamentally different
mechanism of proliferation control in these stem cells, in comparison
with most somatic cells, involving proteins in the DNA damage checkpoint
pathway.

Ayoub et al. (2008) identified a dynamic change in chromatin that
promotes H2AX phosphorylation in mammalian cells. DNA breaks swiftly
mobilized heterochromatin protein-1-beta (HP1-beta; 604511), a chromatin
factor bound to histone H3 methylated on lysine-9 (H3K9me; see 602810).
Local changes in histone tail modifications were not apparent. Instead,
phosphorylation of HP1-beta on amino acid thr51 accompanied
mobilization, releasing HP1-beta from chromatin by disrupting hydrogen
bonds that fold its chromodomain around H3K9me. Inhibition of casein
kinase-2 (CK2; see 115442), an enzyme implicated in DNA damage sensing
and repair, suppressed thr51 phosphorylation and HP1-beta mobilization
in living cells. CK2 inhibition, or a constitutively chromatin-bound
HP1-beta mutant, diminished H2AX phosphorylation. Ayoub et al. (2008)
concluded that their findings revealed a signaling cascade that helps to
initiate the DNA damage response, altering chromatin by modifying a
histone code mediator protein, HP1, but not the code itself.

During the double-strand break response, mammalian chromatin undergoes
reorganization demarcated by H2A.X ser139 phosphorylation. Xiao et al.
(2009) reported a regulatory mechanism mediated by WSTF (BAZ1B; 605681),
a component of the WICH (WSTF-ISWI ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling)
complex. Xiao et al. (2009) showed that WSTF has intrinsic tyrosine
kinase activity by means of a domain that shares no sequence homology to
any known kinase fold. They showed that WSTF phosphorylates tyr142 of
H2A.X, and that WSTF activity has an important role in regulating
several events that are critical for the DNA damage response. Xiao et
al. (2009) concluded that their work demonstrated a novel mechanism that
regulates the DNA damage response and expanded the knowledge of domains
that contain intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. The kinase domain of
WSTF consists of an N motif containing the conserved WAC domain, and a
novel C motif.

Cook et al. (2009) reported that the protein-tyrosine phosphatase EYA
(601653) is involved in promoting efficient DNA repair rather than
apoptosis in response to genotoxic stress in mammalian embryonic kidney
cells by executing a damage signal-dependent dephosphorylation of an
H2AX carboxy-terminal tyrosine phosphate (Y142). This posttranslational
modification determines the relative recruitment of either DNA repair or
proapoptotic factors to the tail of serine-phosphorylated histone H2AX
and allows it to function as an active determinant of repair/survival
versus apoptotic responses to DNA damage, revealing an additional
phosphorylation-dependent mechanism that modulates survival/apoptotic
decisions during mammalian organogenesis.

In vivo, Helmink et al. (2011) demonstrated that in murine cells the
histone protein H2AX prevents nucleases other than Artemis (605988) from
processing hairpin-sealed coding ends; in the absence of H2AX, CtIP
(604124) can efficiently promote the hairpin opening and resection of
DNA ends generated by RAG (see 179615) cleavage. This CtIP-mediated
resection is inhibited by gamma-H2AX and by MDC1 (607593), which binds
to gamma-H2AX in chromatin flanking DNA double-strand breaks. Moreover,
the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated kinase (ATM; 607585) activates
antagonistic pathways that modulate this resection. CtIP DNA end
resection activity is normally limited to cells at postreplicative
stages of the cell cycle, in which it is essential for homology-mediated
repair. In G1-phase lymphocytes, DNA ends that are processed by CtIP are
not efficiently joined by classical nonhomologous end joining and the
joints that do form frequently use microhomologies and show significant
chromosomal deletions. Helmink et al. (2011) concluded that H2AX
preserves the structural integrity of broken DNA ends in G1-phase
lymphocytes, thereby preventing these DNA ends from accessing repair
pathways that promote genomic instability.

Pei et al. (2011) found that H4K20 methylation actually increases
locally upon the induction of double-strand breaks and that methylation
of H4K20 at double-strand breaks is mediated by the histone
methyltransferase MMSET (602952) in mammals. Downregulation of MMSET
significantly decreases H4K20 methylation at double-strand breaks and
the subsequent accumulation of 53BP1 (605230). Furthermore, Pei et al.
(2011) found that the recruitment of MMSET to double-strand breaks
requires the gamma-H2AX-MDC1 pathway; specifically, the interaction
between the MDC1 BRCT domain and phosphorylated ser102 of MMSET. Thus,
Pei et al. (2011) proposed that a pathway involving
gamma-H2AX-MDC1-MMSET regulates the induction of H4K20 methylation on
histones around double-strand breaks, which, in turn, facilitates 53BP1
recruitment.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ivanova et al. (1994) cloned the human genomic region encompassing the
H2AX gene. They reported that the upstream region of this gene contains
2 CCAAT boxes, the more proximal of which shares homology and binding
factors with another replication-unlinked histone, H2A.Z (142763).

MAPPING

Ivanova et al. (1994) mapped the human H2AX gene to chromosome
11q23.2-q23.3 using fluorescence in situ hybridization. This
localization is not near clusters of other human histone genes on
chromosomes 1, 6, and 12. They also noted that the downstream sequence
of the H2AX gene overlaps the hydroxymethylbilane synthase gene (HMBS;
609806), which has also been mapped to chromosome 11q.

Porcher and Grandchamp (1995) reported that in both mouse and human, the
H2AX and AIP genes are arranged in an opposite, tail-to-tail,
orientation, with less than 340 nucleotides separating their 3-prime
ends. They mapped mouse H2AX to chromosome 9 based on its proximity to
the previously mapped mouse AIP, or UPS, gene.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Srivastava et al. (2008) found an alteration of the H2AFX gene copy
number in 25 (37%) of 65 breast cancer (114480) tissues derived from
patients with sporadic forms of the disorder. Gene deletion accounted
for 19 (29%) of total cases and gene amplification for 6 (9%). Patients
with estrogen (ES1R1; 133430) and progesterone receptor (PGR;
607311)-positive tumors had more significantly altered copy numbers of
H2AFX compared to those with ER/PR-negative tumors. None of the tissues
contained H2AFX sequence alterations.

ANIMAL MODEL

Celeste et al. (2002) generated mice deficient in H2AX by targeted
disruption. Although H2AX is not essential for irradiation-induced
cell-cycle checkpoints, H2ax -/- mice were radiation sensitive, growth
retarded, and immune deficient, and mutant males were infertile. These
pleiotropic phenotypes were associated with chromosomal instability,
repair defects, and impaired recruitment of NBS1 (602667), TP53BP1
(605230), and BRCA1 (113705), but not RAD51 (179617), to
irradiation-induced foci. Thus, Celeste et al. (2002) concluded that
H2AX is critical for facilitating the assembly of specific DNA-repair
complexes on damaged DNA.

Phosphorylation of the human histone variant H2AX and H2Av, its homolog
in Drosophila melanogaster, occurs rapidly at sites of DNA double-strand
breaks. Kusch et al. (2004) demonstrated that the Drosophila Tip60
(HTATIP; 601409) chromatin-remodeling complex acetylated nucleosomal
phospho-H2Av and exchanged it with an unmodified H2Av. Both the histone
acetyltransferase Tip60 as well as the ATPase Domino/p400 (606265)
catalyzed the exchange of phospho-H2Av. Thus, Kusch et al. (2004)
concluded that their data reveal a previously unknown mechanism for
selective histone exchange that uses the concerted action of 2 distinct
chromatin-remodeling enzymes within the same multiprotein complex.

During meiotic prophase in males, the X and Y chromosomes condense to
form a macrochromatin body, termed the sex (or XY) body, within which X-
and Y-linked genes are transcriptionally repressed. Fernandez-Capetillo
et al. (2003) found that H2ax-null mouse spermatocytes did not form a
sex body and failed to undergo sex chromosome inactivation. Moreover,
apoptotic elimination of H2ax-null spermatocytes occurred at the
pachytene stage via a p53 (191170)-independent pathway.
Fernandez-Capetillo et al. (2003) concluded that H2AX is essential for
condensation and silencing of the sex chromosomes during male meiosis.

Fernandez-Capetillo et al. (2003) found that H2ax was dispensable for
mitotic telomere maintenance and chromosome fusions arising from either
shortened or deprotected telomeres. However, telomeres of H2ax-deficient
mouse spermatocytes showed abnormally lengthy clustering along the
nuclear periphery during the first meiotic prophase. Atm (607585)-null
leptotene/zygotene-stage spermatocytes showed a similar lengthy telomere
clustering in addition to absence of H2ax staining. Fernandez-Capetillo
et al. (2003) concluded that ATM facilitates telomere-promoted homolog
pairing via phosphorylation of H2AX.

Celeste et al. (2003) found that loss of a single H2ax allele
compromised genomic integrity and enhanced susceptibility to cancer in
mice lacking p53. Compared with heterozygotes, tumors arose earlier in
the H2ax homozygous null background, and H2ax -/- p53 -/- lymphomas
harbored an increased frequency of clonal nonreciprocal translocations
and amplifications, including complex rearrangements that juxtaposed the
Myc oncogene (190080) to antigen receptor loci. Restoration of the
H2ax-null allele with wildtype H2ax restored genomic stability and
radiation resistance, but this effect was abolished by substitution of
the conserved serine phosphorylation sites in H2ax with alanine or
glutamic acid. Celeste et al. (2003) concluded that H2AX is a genomic
caretaker that requires the function of both alleles for optimal
protection against tumorigenesis. Bassing et al. (2003) presented
similar findings.

Hypoxia induces neovascularization and can also induce a DNA-damage
response. Economopoulou et al. (2009) showed that hypoxia-induced
replication-associated generation of phosphorylated gamma-H2AX in human
umbilical vein endothelial cells in vitro and in mice. In mice, this was
associated with retinal neovascularization. H2ax-null mice showed
decreased endothelial cell proliferation under hypoxic conditions,
including deficient hypoxia-induced neovascularization in proliferative
retinopathy, in response to hind-limb ischemia, and in tumor
angiogenesis. In contrast, developmental angiogenesis was not affected.
Endothelial-specific H2ax deletion resulted in reduced hypoxia-driven
retinal neovascularization and tumor neovascularization. Economopoulou
et al. (2009) suggested that H2AX and activation of the DNA repair
response is needed for endothelial cells to maintain their proliferation
under hypoxic conditions, and that H2AX is crucial for hypoxia-driven
neovascularization.

611888	TITLE *611888 ETS2 REPRESSOR FACTOR; ERF
;;PE2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the ETS family of transcription factors, such as ERF,
regulate cell proliferation and differentiation. They share a highly
conserved DNA-binding domain, the ETS domain, that recognizes the
sequence GGAA/T (de Castro et al., 1997). For further information on ETS
transcription factors, see ETS1 (164720).

CLONING

By screening a myelogenous leukemia cell line cDNA library with an
ETS-binding site in the ETS2 (164740) promoter, followed by screening a
placenta cDNA library, Sgouras et al. (1995) obtained full-length ERF.
The deduced 548-amino acid protein contains an N-terminal ETS domain
structurally similar to the ETS domains of ELK1 (311040) and SAP1 (ELK4
600246). It also has a central proline-rich region, 2 putative SH3
interaction sites, and several putative phosphorylation sites. Northern
blot analysis detected a 2.7-kb transcript in all tissues and cell lines
examined. Western blot analysis showed multiple phosphorylated forms of
ERF ranging from 75 to 85 kD.

By RT-PCR of human leukemia cell lines using degenerate oligonucleotides
based on the ETS domains of FLI1 (193067) and ERG (165080), followed by
screening leukemia cell line and testis cDNA libraries, de Castro et al.
(1997) cloned ERF, which they called PE2. The ETS domain of ERF is most
similar to the ETS domains of PE1 (ETV3; 164873), FLI1, and ERG.
Northern blot analysis detected ERF expression in all human tissues and
cell lines examined, with highest levels in heart, testis, ovary, and
pancreas.

Liu et al. (1997) cloned mouse Erf. The human and mouse ERF proteins
share 98% amino acid identity, with most of the differences in the
C-terminal transcriptional repressor domain.

By whole-mount RNA in situ hybridization and RT-PCR, Twigg et al. (2013)
observed Erf expression in wildtype mice along the osteogenic margins of
developing calvarial bones, in a similar distribution to that seen for
the master osteogenic regulator Runx2 (600211).

GENE STRUCTURE

De Castro et al. (1997) determined that the ERF gene contains 4 exons
and spans more than 9 kb. The 5-prime flanking region is GC rich. It has
no canonical TATA-binding motif, but contains several binding motifs for
AP-1 (see 165160) and CREB (see 123810) factors and a single MYB
(189990)-binding site.

Liu et al. (1997) identified a conserved TATA element in mouse and human
ERF. Several transcription factor-binding sites are also conserved,
including 2 SP1 (189906) sites and an ETS-binding site.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid analysis and FISH, de Castro et al. (1997) mapped
the ERF gene to chromosome 19q13.2-q13.31.

Using FISH, Liu et al. (1997) mapped the ERF gene to chromosome 19q13.1.
They mapped the mouse Erf gene to a region of chromosome 7 that shares
homology of synteny with human chromosome 19q13.

GENE FUNCTION

Using transfection assays of HeLa cells, Sgouras et al. (1995) found
that ERF repressed the ETS2 promoter more than 30-fold. ERF also
repressed the GATA1 (605371) promoter in the presence of its
transactivator, GATA1. ERF suppressed the ETS-dependent transforming
activity of the gag-myb (18990)-ets fusion oncogene of the avian E26
virus. The level of transcriptional repression by ERF was proportional
to its affinity for the ERF target sequence in the promoter. The
isolated DNA-binding domain of ERF strongly inhibited the ETS2 promoter,
whereas removal of the DNA-binding domain of ERF abrogated its repressor
activity. Sgouras et al. (1995) mapped the ERF repressor domain between
amino acids 472 and 530. Although the ERF protein level remained
constant throughout the cell cycle, ERF phosphorylation status was
altered as a function of the cell cycle and after mitogenic stimulation.
ERF was hyperphosphorylated in cells transformed by the activated Ha-ras
(HRAS; 190020) and v-src (SRC; 190090) genes, and the transcription
repressor activity of ERF was decreased after cotransfection with
activated Ha-ras or the kinase domain of RAF1 (164760), indicating that
ERF activity is probably regulated by the Ras/MAPK pathway. Consistent
with the in vivo phosphorylation and inactivation by Ha-ras, ERF was
efficiently phosphorylated in vitro by Erk2 (MAPK1; 176948) and CDC2
(116940)/cyclin B (see CCNB1; 123836) kinases at sites similar to those
detected in vivo. Mutation of thr526 to ala eliminated a major ERF
phosphoprotein in vivo, after phorbol ester induction, and in vitro,
after ERK2 phosphorylation. Substitution of thr526 for glu also
decreased the repression ability of ERF. Sgouras et al. (1995) concluded
that ERF is involved in transcriptional regulation of genes activated
during entry into G1 phase.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 12 families with craniosynostosis (CRS4; 600775), Twigg et al. (2013)
identified heterozygosity for mutations in the ERF gene (see, e.g.,
611888.0001-611888.0005).

ANIMAL MODEL

Papadaki et al. (2007) found that mouse Erf was expressed throughout
embryonic development and adulthood. However, in situ hybridization of
developing placenta showed that, after 7.5 days postcoitum, expression
of Erf was restricted to extraembryonic ectoderm, and after 9.5 days
postcoitum, it was restricted to a subpopulation of labyrinth cells. Erf
+/- mice appeared normal and were fertile, but Erf -/- embryos died in
utero at day 10 due to severe placenta defects. Erf -/- embryos failed
to undergo chorioallantoic attachment and labyrinth development and
instead had an expanded chorion layer that failed to further
differentiate. These mice also failed to close the ectoplacental cone
cavity. Erf -/- placentas had abnormalities in the giant cell and
spongiotrophoblast layers. Erf -/- trophoblast stem cells showed delayed
differentiation compared with wildtype cells and failed to express
specific differentiation markers.

Twigg et al. (2013) generated mice with a conditional Erf allele and
observed that mice heterozygous or homozygous for the conditional allele
were grossly normal, whereas mice that were compound heterozygous for
the conditional allele and a null allele had domed heads that became
apparent during the first 3 to 6 weeks of life. Micro-CT scanning showed
craniosynostosis affecting multiple calvarial sutures. No other specific
skeletal abnormalities were evident. Quantification of transcripts in
embryonic day 16.5 calvariae showed up to 2-fold downregulation of
multiple osteogenic markers in conditional/null mutants compared to
wildtype littermates. Despite this mildly delayed embryonic
ossification, by postnatal day 14 there was variable fusion of the
cranial sutures of mutant, but not of wildtype, pups.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CRANIOSYNOSTOSIS 4
ERF, ARG183TER

In 2 brothers with craniosynostosis (CRS4; 600775), Twigg et al. (2013)
identified heterozygosity for a c.547C-T transition in exon 4 of the ERF
gene, resulting in an arg183-to-ter (R183X) substitution. The mutation
was also present in their mother, who had exorbitism and midface
hypoplasia suggestive of Crouzon syndrome (123500) but was negative for
mutation in the FGFR2 gene (176943); she had inherited the R183X ERF
mutation from her mother, who exhibited only macrocephaly.
Immunoblotting of fibroblasts or lymphoblastoid cells from affected
individuals showed lower expression of full-length ERF compared to
wildtype cells. The older brother had craniosynostosis affecting all
sutures of the cranial vault, whereas the younger brother had metopic,
sagittal, and left coronal synostosis.

.0002
CRANIOSYNOSTOSIS 4
ERF, 2-BP DEL, 891AG

In 4 affected individuals from 3 unrelated families with
craniosynostosis (CRS4; 600775), Twigg et al. (2013) identified
heterozygosity for a 2-bp deletion (c.891_892delAG) in exon 4 of the ERF
gene, causing a frameshift predicted to result in a premature
termination codon (Gly299ArgfsTer9) within the ERK interaction domain.
Haplotype analysis in 2 of the families revealed different
microsatellite genotypes. One 10-year-old male proband was diagnosed
with syndromic pansynostosis and had a copper-beaten appearance of the
skull, hypertelorism, exorbitism, downslanting palpebral fissures, and
global developmental delay involving poor attention span and receptive
language, and behavioral difficulties. The 9.4-year-old male proband
from a second family, who was diagnosed with nonsyndromic
craniosynostosis involving the sagittal and bilateral lambdoid sutures,
had elevated intracranial pressure preoperatively as well as specific
language impairment. In the third family, there were 2 affected sisters
diagnosed with syndromic craniosynostosis: the elder, who had features
suggestive of Crouzon syndrome (123500) but was negative for mutation in
the FGFR2 gene (176943), exhibited bilateral coronal and lambdoid
synostosis, hypertelorism, exorbitism, and midface hypoplasia, whereas
the younger had bilateral lambdoid involvement with hypertelorism,
hyperactivity, and poor concentration. Their mother, who also carried
the 2-bp deletion in the ERF gene, exhibited exorbitism and short
digits.

.0003
CRANIOSYNOSTOSIS 4
ERF, ARG86CYS

In 2 unrelated boys with craniosynostosis (CRS4; 600775), Twigg et al.
(2013) identified heterozygosity for a c.256C-T transition in exon 2 of
the ERF gene, resulting in an arg86-to-cys (R86C) substitution at a
highly conserved residue in the ETS domain. One of the boys, who was
diagnosed with nonsyndromic synostosis of the right lambdoid suture, had
a Chiari type I malformation (see 118420), macrocephaly, speech and
language delay, and middle ear effusions; he had inherited the mutation
from his unaffected mother. The other boy, who had been diagnosed with
Crouzon (123500)-like syndromic craniosynostosis but was negative for
mutation in the FGFR2 gene (176943), had synostosis of the sagittal and
bilateral lambdoid sutures with elevated intracranial pressure at the
time of his first operative procedure, and exhibited hypertelorism,
exorbitism, class I dental malocclusion, broad thumbs and halluces, and
a speech articulation disorder with verbal dyspraxia and general motor
development dyspraxia. The R86C mutation arose de novo in both the
second proband and in the first proband's mother.

.0004
CRANIOSYNOSTOSIS 4
ERF, ARG65GLN

In a 9.9-year-old boy with craniosynostosis (CRS4; 600775), Twigg et al.
(2013) identified heterozygosity for a c.194G-A transition in exon 2 of
the ERF gene, resulting in an arg65-to-gln (R65Q) substitution at a
conserved residue in the ETS domain. The boy, who was diagnosed with
nonsyndromic craniosynostosis involving the sagittal and right coronal
sutures, also had a platelet disorder. He inherited the mutation from
his mother, who was macrocephalic without known craniosynostosis.

.0005
CRANIOSYNOSTOSIS 4
ERF, GLN424TER

In a 10-year-old girl with craniosynostosis (CRS4; 600775), Twigg et al.
(2013) identified heterozygosity for a c.1270C-T transition in exon 4 of
the ERF gene, resulting in a gln424-to-ter (Q424X) substitution.
Immunoblotting of fibroblasts or lymphoblastoid cells from affected
individuals showed lower expression of full-length ERF compared to
wildtype cells. The girl, who had been diagnosed with a Crouzon
(123500)-like syndromic craniosynostosis but was negative for mutation
in the FGFR2 gene (176943), had synostosis of all sutures of the cranial
vault, a Chiari type I malformation (see 118420), copper-beaten
appearance of skull, hypertelorism, exorbitism, thoracic and lumbar
scoliosis, and broad toes. Her 8-year-old brother, who also carried the
mutation, did not have craniosynostosis but did have a Chiari I
malformation, as well as hypertelorism, exorbitism, and broad toes. The
sibs inherited the Q424X mutation from their mother, who exhibited only
hypertelorism, and also had an unspecified cardiac septal defect and von
Willebrand disease (see 193400).

involved in CoQ biosynthesis (Casarin et al., 2008).

CLONING

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to yeast Coq4,
followed by PCR of fibroblast cDNA, Casarin et al. (2008) cloned human
COQ4. The deduced 265-amino acid protein has an N-terminal mitochondrial
localization sequence with a consensus cleavage site at pro22. COQ4 was
predicted to be a soluble protein. Northern blot analysis detected a
transcript of 1.3 to 1.4 kb in all tissues examined, with highest
expression in liver, lung, and pancreas. EST database analysis and
5-prime RACE detected a splice variant that lacks exon 1 and initiates
translation from an ATG codon within exon 2. The isoform encoded by this
variant, COQ4 isoform-2, lacks the first 24 amino acids of full-length
COQ4 isoform-1. Fluorescence-tagged COQ4 isoform-1 localized to
mitochondria in transfected HeLa cells, whereas COQ4 isoform-2 localized
mainly to the cytosol and to some extent the nucleus, but not to
mitochondria.

GENE FUNCTION

Casarin et al. (2008) showed that full-length COQ4, but not COQ4
isoform-2, restored growth in Coq4-deficient yeast.

GENE STRUCTURE

Casarin et al. (2008) determined that the COQ4 gene contains 7 exons and
spans about 12 kb. The 5-prime flanking region lacks a TATA box, but it
contains numerous consensus transcription factor binding sites and 4
transcription initiation sites. Intron 1 also contains several consensus
transcriptional elements and an additional transcription initiation
site.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Casarin et al. (2008) mapped the COQ4 gene
to chromosome 9q34.13.

CYTOGENETICS

Salviati et al. (2012) reported a boy with a severe encephalomyopathic
disorder, including poor growth, hypotonia, and delayed psychomotor
development with moderate mental retardation and an inability to walk at
age 3 years, associated with a de novo heterozygous 3.9-Mb deletion of
chromosome 9q34; the deleted region included at least 80 genes, 1 of
which was COQ4. Laboratory studies showed a reduction of mitochondrial
respiratory complexes II and III in fibroblasts and a decrease of
coenzyme Q content (43% of control), consistent with coenzyme Q
deficiency (607426). Supplementation of coenzyme Q in patient
fibroblasts resulted in correction of the complex II and III
deficiencies. A 50% knockdown of COQ4 mRNA in HeLa cells resulted in an
approximately 50% decrease in COQ4 protein, and haploinsufficiency of
Coq4 in yeast caused a reduction in complex II and III activity. Oral
supplementation with coenzyme Q using ubiquinone and subsequently
ubiquinol in the patient resulted in clinical improvement. Salviati et
al. (2012) maintained that haploinsufficiency for the COQ4 gene in this
patient caused the CoQ deficiency, while noting that the disorder is
usually inherited as an autosomal recessive trait.

605453	TITLE *605453 ATP-BINDING CASSETTE, SUBFAMILY B, MEMBER 9; ABCB9
DESCRIPTION For background information on the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family of
transporter proteins, see ABCA4 (601691). In addition to the 'full' ABC
transporters with 2 transmembrane domains and 2 nucleotide-binding
domains, there are 'half' proteins that contain only 1 of each domain
(e.g., ABCB1; 171050). Full transporters are usually found in the plasma
membrane, whereas half transporters are found in subcellular organelles.

By searching an EST database and screening a T-lymphoblast cDNA library,
Zhang et al. (2000) obtained a cDNA encoding ABCB9. Sequence analysis
predicted that the 766-amino acid ABCB9 protein has 10 potential
N-terminal transmembrane segments. ABCB9 shares 94% identity with the
rodent sequences and is approximately 39% identical to 2 human
endoplasmic reticulum half transporters, TAP1 (ABCB2; 170260) and TAP2
(ABCB3; 170261). RT-PCR and genomic sequence analysis established the
existence of a splice variant with a 129-bp deletion expressed in testis
and brain. Northern blot analysis detected low expression of a 3.7-kb
transcript in most tissues tested, with an additional 2.2-kb transcript
detected in tissues with relatively high expression, such as testis.
Western blot analysis showed expression of a 72-kD nonglycosylated
protein, significantly smaller than the predicted mass of 84.5 kD, that
was enriched in lysosomes. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated
colocalization of ABCB9 with the lysosomal proteins LAMP1 (153330) and
LAMP2 (309060). Immunohistochemical analysis detected ABCB9 expression
in Sertoli cells of rodent seminiferous tubules.

Allikmets et al. (1996) mapped an EST corresponding to the ABCB9 gene to
12q24.

G PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTOR 92; GPR92;;
GPR93
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs, or GPRs) contain 7 transmembrane
domains and transduce extracellular signals through heterotrimeric G
proteins.

CLONING

Lee et al. (2001) identified GPR92, which they designated GPR93, in a
genomic database using the sequences of the cysteinyl leukotriene-2
receptor (605666) as query. GPR92 encodes a deduced 372-amino acid
protein that shares 36 to 40% sequence identity in the transmembrane
regions with the G protein-coupled purinergic receptor P2Y5 (P2RY5;
609239), GPR23 (300086), and GPR17 (603071).

MAPPING

Lee et al. (2001) mapped the GPR92 gene to chromosome 12 based on
sequence similarity between the GPR92 sequence and a BAC clone (GenBank
GENBANK AC006087) localized to chromosome 12. White et al. (2000)
identified GPR92 near the FGF23 gene on chromosome 12p13.

194558	TITLE *194558 ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 83; ZNF83
DESCRIPTION 
MAPPING

Marine et al. (1994) assigned the ZNF83 gene (also known as HPF1) to
chromosome 19 by screening a human/rodent hybrid panel and localized the
gene further to 19q13.3-q13.4 by fluorescence in situ hybridization and
digital imaging microscopy.

HISTORY

Conserved structural motifs define large families of nucleic acid
binding proteins in eukaryotes. The C2H2-type zinc finger motif,
conferring both specific RNA and DNA binding activities, was first
detected within the amino acid sequence of the Xenopus transcription
factor IIIA (Miller et al., 1985). Thereafter, vertebrate genomes were
shown to encode hundreds of so-called zinc finger proteins (ZFPs).
Subfamilies were defined on the basis of conserved sequence elements
outside the finger repeat, such as the KRAB domain. Several members of
these subfamilies were found to have a clustered genomic organization.

604695	TITLE *604695 ADP-RIBOSYLATION FACTOR-LIKE 3; ARL3
;;ARFL3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs) are low molecular weight GTP-binding
proteins belonging to the RAS superfamily; see ARF1 (103180). By
sequence analysis of clones randomly isolated from a fetal brain cDNA
library, Cavenagh et al. (1994) obtained an EST encoding ARL3. The
predicted 182-amino acid ARL3 protein shares 97% amino acid identity
with rat Arl3 and 43% identity with human ARF1. Like the ARFs, ARL3 has
a glycine at position 2, the site of N myristoylation, and lacks
cysteine residues near the C terminus, which are found in other members
of the RAS family. Northern blot analysis detected a 1-kb ARL3
transcript in all tissues tested, with highest expression in heart and
lung, and lower expression in brain, liver, kidney, ovary, and testis. A
5.5-kb transcript was also detected in most tissues, with highest
expression in brain. Immunoblot analysis detected ARL3 in human tumor
cell lines but not in normal rodent cells. Although ARL3 binds GTP, it
is devoid of activity in the cholera toxin-dependent ADP-ribosylation of
Gs (see 139320), and is therefore classified as an ARF-like protein.

By immunohistochemical analysis of several mammalian cell lines,
including human, Zhou et al. (2006) found that both ARL2 (601175) and
ARL3 were expressed at centrosomes, in cytoplasmic punctae, and in the
nucleus. ARL3 was also expressed at Golgi membranes and at the mitotic
spindle, particularly in metaphase and anaphase. Both ARL2 and ARL3
localized to centrosomes throughout the cell cycle, and their expression
in other structures was cell type specific.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid and radiation hybrid analyses, Kim (1998) mapped
the ARL3 gene to chromosome 10q23.3.

GENE FUNCTION

Mutations in the retinitis pigmentosa-2 gene (RP2; 300757) cause a
severe form of X-linked retinal degeneration (see 312600). RP2 is a
plasma membrane-associated protein which shares homology with
tubulin-specific chaperone cofactor C (TBCC; 602971). The RP2 protein,
like cofactor C, stimulates the GTPase activity of tubulin in
combination with cofactor D. RP2 has also been shown to interact with
ARL3 in a nucleotide- and myristoylation-dependent manner. Grayson et
al. (2002) examined the relationship between RP2, cofactor C, and ARL3
in patient-derived cell lines and in the retina. In human retina, RP2
was localized to the plasma membrane in both rod and cone
photoreceptors, extending from the outer segment through the inner
segment to the synaptic terminals. In contrast, cofactor C and ARL3
localized predominantly to the photoreceptor-connecting cilium in rod
and cone photoreceptors. Cofactor C was cytoplasmic in distribution,
whereas ARL3 localized to other microtubule structures within all cells.
Grayson et al. (2002) suggested that RP2 may function in concert with
ARL3 to link the cell membrane with the cytoskeleton in photoreceptors
as part of the cell signaling or vesicular transport machinery.

Veltel et al. (2008) found that recombinant human RP2 formed a complex
with murine Arl3 and with human HRG4 (UNC119; 604011), the retinal
homolog of PDE-delta (PDE6D; 602676). RP2 induced hydrolysis of Arl3-GTP
in the Arl3-HRG4 complex, leading to the release of HRG4, which bound
only weakly to Arl3-GDP.

Zhou et al. (2006) stated that ARL2 and ARL3 arose from a common
ancestor early in eukaryotic evolution and that they remain highly
related. However, Zhou et al. (2006) found that the 2 GTPases had
distinct effects on microtubule function in mammalian cells. Knockdown
of ARL3 using RNA interference changed HeLa cell morphology, caused
Golgi fragmentation, and increased acetylation of alpha-tubulin (see
602529), which resulted in failure of cytokinesis, with increased number
of binucleated cells. Overexpression of ARL3 had little effect. In
contrast, knockdown of ARL2 in HeLa cells showed little effect, but
expression of ARL2 with a dominant activating mutation caused failure of
tubulin polymerization, with loss of microtubules and microtubule-based
mitotic spindle, resulting in cell cycle arrest in M phase.

Ismail et al. (2011) stated that PDE-delta binds to farnesylated small G
proteins. They presented the 1.7-angstrom structure of human PDE-delta
in complex with C-terminally farnesylated human RHEB (601293). PDE-delta
interacted almost exclusively with the C-terminal farnesyl moiety of
RHEB, which was inserted within the farnesyl-binding pocket of
PDE-delta. The interaction did not require guanine nucleotide, which
bound RHEB on a surface nearly opposite to the PDE-delta-binding site.
PDE-delta also interacted with mouse Arl2. The interaction of PDE-delta
with Arl2 was dependent upon GTP and caused a conformational change in
PDE-delta that closed its farnesyl-binding pocket. In solution, addition
of Arl2-GTP dissociated the PDE-delta-farnesylated RHEB complex.
Addition of Arl3-GTP also caused release of farnesylated RHEB from
PDE-delta. In transfected canine kidney cells, fluorescence-labeled RHEB
showed endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi localization. Addition of
PDE-delta relocalized RHEB into a cytoplasmic and nuclear distribution,
and subsequent addition of Arl2-GTP restored RHEB localization to ER and
Golgi membranes. Ismail et al. (2011) concluded that PDE-delta functions
as a solubilization factor for farnesylated RHEB and that ARL2 and ARL3
act in a GTP-dependent manner as allosteric release factors for
farnesylated RHEB.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Veltel et al. (2008) solved the crystal structure of the central G
domain of mouse Arl3 bound to a GTP analog and human RP2 to 2.6-angstrom
resolution. Both switch regions of Arl3 interacted with the N-terminal
beta-helix domain of RP2. Biochemical analysis showed that Arl3 had a
slow intrinsic rate of GTP hydrolysis, which was accelerated more than
1,400-fold by catalytic amounts of RP2. Veltel et al. (2008) also
determined that arg118 of RP2 and gln71 of Arl3 were crucial active site
catalytic residues. They concluded that RP2 is a GTPase-activating
protein (GAP) for ARL3.

ANIMAL MODEL

Schrick et al. (2006) found that while Arl3 +/- mice appeared normal,
Arl3 -/- mice were obtained at a submendelian ratio, were small and
sickly, and had markedly swollen abdomens. Arl3 -/- mice failed to
thrive and all died by 3 weeks of age. They exhibited abnormal
development of renal, hepatic, and pancreatic epithelial tubule
structures, with abnormal epithelial cell proliferation and cyst
formation characteristic of ARPKD (263200). Moreover, mice lacking Arl3
exhibited photoreceptor degeneration as early as postnatal day 14.
Schrick et al. (2006) concluded that absence of Arl3 causes a ciliary
disease affecting the kidney, biliary tract, pancreas, and retina.

103020	TITLE *103020 ADENYLATE KINASE 2; AK2
;;ADENYLATE KINASE, MITOCHONDRIAL MYOKINASE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Nucleoside monophosphate kinases, including adenylate kinases, catalyze
the reversible phosphorylation between nucleoside triphosphates and
monophosphates.

CLONING

Bruns and Regina (1977) analyzed the subcellular compartmentalization of
adenylate kinase-2 (EC 2.7.4.3) in HeLa cells, mouse RAG cells, and
RAG-human hybrids expressing human AK2. The results indicated that AK2
is a mitochondrial enzyme.

Noma et al. (1998) isolated cDNAs encoding human adenylate kinase-2 from
a HeLa cell cDNA library, using bovine AK2 cDNA as probe. Two
transcripts were identified: one, designated AK2A, encodes a deduced
239-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 26.5 kD, and
the other, designated AK2B, encodes a deduced 232-amino acid protein
with a predicted molecular mass of 25.6 kD. Northern blot analysis
demonstrated 3 strong hybridizing signals of 0.9 (AK2A), 1.7 (AK2B), and
3.5 kb, with high expression in liver, heart, skeletal muscle, and
pancreas, moderate expression in kidney, placenta, and brain, and weak
expression in lung. However, Western blot analysis showed high levels of
AK2 protein in liver, heart, and kidney, low levels in lung, and
undetectable levels in brain and skeletal muscle.

MAPPING

The existence of a second adenylate kinase locus linked to PGM1 and
peptidase C, i.e., on chromosome 1, was suggested by cell hybridization
studies by Van Cong et al. (1972). The Goss-Harris method of mapping
combines features of recombinational study in families and synteny tests
in hybrid cells. As applied to chromosome 1, the method shows that AK2
and UMPK are distal to PGM1 and that the order of the loci is PGM1:
UMPK: (AK2, alpha-FUC): ENO1 (Goss and Harris, 1977). Carritt et al.
(1982) presented evidence that AK2 is in 1p34.

GENE FUNCTION

Lee et al. (2007) showed that intrinsic apoptosis in human cells that
was induced by the chemotherapeutic agent etoposide or the antibiotic
staurosporine, but not by FAS ligand (TNFSF6; 134638) or TRAIL (TNFSF10;
603598), caused translocation of AK2 from mitochondria to the cytoplasm,
followed by formation of a complex between AK2, FADD (602457), and
CASP10 (601762). Yeast 2-hybrid analysis, protein pull-down assays, and
immunoprecipitation analysis showed that the N- and C-terminal domains
of AK2, which include nucleoside- and substrate-binding domains,
respectively, bound the C-terminal death domain of FADD. AK2 binding
promoted association of CASP10 with FADD, and addition of purified AK2
protein to cell extracts induced activation of CASP10 via FADD, leading
to subsequent activation of CASP9 (602234) and CASP3 (600636). Apoptosis
through the AK2 complex did not correlate with the adenylate kinase
activity of AK2, did not require CASP8 (601763)-mediated apoptotic
responses, and did not involve mitochondrial cytochrome c release.
Immunodepletion or knockdown of AK2, FADD, or CASP10 abrogated
etoposide-induced apoptosis, and AK2 complexes were not observed in
several etoposide-resistant human tumor cell lines that were deficient
in expression of FADD, CASP10, or CASP3. In contrast to the findings in
human cells, etoposide-induced apoptosis was observed in mouse embryonic
fibroblasts that lacked Fadd expression. Since mice also lack Casp10,
Lee et al. (2007) concluded that mice lack an apoptotic pathway
comparable to the AK2-FADD-CASP10 pathway in humans.

Pannicke et al. (2009) showed that knockdown of zebrafish ak2 also leads
to aberrant leukocyte development, demonstrating the evolutionarily
conserved role of AK2. They concluded that their results provide in vivo
evidence for AK2 selectivity in leukocyte differentiation.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 6 affected individuals from 5 families segregating reticular
dysgenesis (267500), Pannicke et al. (2009) identified 6 causative
mutations in homozygous or compound heterozygous state
(103020.0001-103020.0006).

Lagresle-Peyrou et al. (2009) identified biallelic mutations in AK2
(103020.0007-103020.0013) in 7 individuals with reticular dysgenesis.
These mutations resulted in absent or strongly decreased protein
expression. The authors then demonstrated that restoration of AK2
expression in the bone marrow cells of individuals with reticular
dysgenesis overcomes the neutrophil differentiation arrest, underlining
its specific requirement in the development of a restricted set of
hematopoietic lineages. Finally, Lagresle-Peyrou et al. (2009)
established that AK2 is specifically expressed in the stria vascularis
region of the inner ear, which provides an explanation for the
sensorineural deafness in these individuals. Lagresle-Peyrou et al.
(2009) concluded that their results identified a previously unknown
mechanism involved in regulation of hematopoietic cell differentiation
in one of the most severe human immunodeficiency syndromes.

(2009) identified a homozygous 5,038-bp deletion encompassing parts of
exon 6, all of intron 6 and parts of exon 7 reaching into the 3-prime
UTR of the AK2 gene. The mutation led to a complete loss of detectable

gene: a 1-bp deletion (118delT) leading to a frameshift and early
truncation of the protein, and a 1A-G transition leading to a
met1-to-val (M1V) substitution (103020.0003). The mutation led to a
complete loss of detectable AK2 protein in fibroblasts and in bone

mutations. The mutations were not found in 112 German or 50 Turkish

complete loss of detectable AK2 protein in fibroblasts and in bone
marrow mononuclear cells. The parents were heterozygous for the
mutation, which was not found in 112 German or 50 Turkish healthy
subjects.

In a Turkish female with reticular dysgenesis (267500), the offspring of
consanguineous parents, Pannicke et al. (2009) identified homozygosity
for a splicing mutation, 498+1G-A, in the AK2 gene. The mutation led to
a complete loss of detectable AK2 protein in fibroblasts and in bone

610669	TITLE *610669 TNFAIP3-INTERACTING PROTEIN 2; TNIP2
;;A20-BINDING INHIBITOR OF NFKB 2; ABIN2;;
FLIP1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TNIP2 binds to the C-terminal zinc finger domain of A20 (TNFAIP3;
191163) and is involved in activation of the ERK (see MAPK3; 601795) MAP
kinase pathway in various cell types (Van Huffel et al., 2001;
Papoutsopoulou et al., 2006).

CLONING

By yeast 2-hybrid screening of a mouse fibrosarcoma cDNA library using
A20 as bait, followed by database analysis, Van Huffel et al. (2001)
identified human TNIP2, which they called ABIN2. The mouse and human
proteins share 76% amino acid identity. Northern blot analysis of mouse
tissues revealed ubiquitous expression, with highest expression in
kidney and weakest expression in skeletal muscle. Western blot analysis
revealed a 50-kD endogenous Abin2 protein in mouse macrophages and
fibrosarcoma cells.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis and coimmunoprecipitation analysis in
transfected human embryonic kidney cells, Van Huffel et al. (2001)
showed that the C-terminal region of mouse Abin2 interacted with the
zinc finger-containing C-terminal half of A20. Fluorescence microscopy
demonstrated cytoplasmic colocalization of Abin2 and A20 following
ectopic expression in HeLa cells. Ectopically expressed Abin2 inhibited
induction of NFKB (see 164011) activation upstream of the IKK (see
IKBKB; 603258) complex. RT-PCR analysis showed that, unlike A20,
expression of Abin2 was not induced by treatment with TNF (191160) or
IFNG (147570).

Chien et al. (2003) found that full-length human ABIN2 could function as
a transcriptional coactivator when expressed in yeast. In contrast, only
a C-terminal fragment of ABIN2, and not the full-length protein, had
transactivating activity when expressed in human embryonic kidney cells.
Chien et al. (2003) showed that the N-terminal 195 amino acids of ABIN2
functioned as a regulatory domain in mammalian cells, retaining the
protein in the cytoplasm and thereby rendering it unable to
transactivate.

Interaction of TPL2 (MAP3K8; 191195) with NFKB1 p105 (164011) is
required to maintain TPL2 metabolic stability and also negatively
regulates TPL2 MEK kinase activity. By affinity purification in HeLa
cells, Lang et al. (2004) identified ABIN2 as a protein associated with
p105. Cotransfection studies in HeLa cells showed that ABIN2 also
interacted with TPL2 and preferentially formed a ternary complex with
both proteins. In bone marrow-derived macrophages, a substantial
fraction of endogenous ABIN2 was associated with both p105 and TPL2.
Mutation and binding analysis showed that ABIN2 interacted with the
death domain and PEST region of p105 and with the C terminus of TPL2.
Depletion of ABIN2 by RNA interference in HeLa cells and human embryonic
kidney cells dramatically reduced TPL2 protein levels, but did not alter
TPL2 mRNA or p105 protein levels. ABIN2 increased the half-life of
cotransfected TPL2 in human embryonic kidney cells. Lang et al. (2004)
concluded that optimal TPL2 stability requires interaction with both
ABIN2 and p105.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the TNIP2
protein to chromosome 4 (TMAP SHGC-68050).

ANIMAL MODEL

Papoutsopoulou et al. (2006) generated healthy mice lacking Tnip2. Using
antigen-presenting cells from these mice, they found that Abin2 was
required for optimal activation of Erk induced by receptors that signal
via Tpl2, including Tlr4 (603030) and Tnfr1 (TNFRSF1A; 191190) in
macrophages, and Cd40 (109535) in B cells. In contrast, Abin2 deficiency
did not affect agonist-induced regulation of Nfkb. Challenge of Tnip2
-/- mice with lipopolysaccharide resulted in serum concentrations of Tnf
equivalent to those in wildtype mice, whereas Il1b (147720)
concentrations were much lower than in wildtype mice. Papoutsopoulou et
al. (2006) concluded that ABIN2 acts to positively regulate ERK
signaling potential by stabilizing TPL2.

601045	TITLE *601045 CATENIN, DELTA-1; CTNND1
;;CATENIN, DELTA; CTNND;;
CADHERIN-ASSOCIATED SRC SUBSTRATE; CAS;;
p120(CTN)
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Catenins were discovered as proteins that are linked ('catena' means
'chain' in Latin) to the cytoplasmic domain of transmembrane cadherin
(see 601120) proteins. Delta-catenin, also called CAS, p120(cas), or
p120(ctn), is a tyrosine kinase substrate implicated in ligand-induced
receptor signaling through the EGF receptor (131550), the PDGF receptor
(PDGFR; see 173490), and the CSF1 receptor (164770), as well as in cell
transformation by SRC (190090). Delta-catenin is a major component of
multiprotein cell-cell adhesion complexes containing E-cadherin
(192090), alpha-catenin (116805), beta-catenin (116806), and
gamma-catenin, also known as plakoglobin (173325) (summary by
Keirsebilck et al., 1998).

CLONING

Reynolds et al. (1992) isolated a mouse p120(ctn) cDNA. Like
beta-catenin and plakoglobin, the predicted protein contains copies of a
repeat originally identified in the Drosophila 'Armadillo' protein.

Keirsebilck et al. (1998) identified human p120(ctn) isoforms, which
they designated 1 to 4, that arise by alternative use of start codons
and additional isoforms that differ due to alternative splicing of 3
exons, which they named A, B, and C. The longest isoform was of type
1ABC and contained 968 amino acids. Isoform 1A contains 933 amino acids
and is 97% identical to mouse p120(ctn). Human p120(ctn) contains up to
10 Armadillo repeats. Keirsebilck et al. (1998) used RT-PCR to
demonstrate tissue-specific and cell line-specific expression of various
isoforms.

Independently, Nagase et al. (1997) identified KIAA0384, a human
p120(ctn) cDNA that encodes isoform 1AC, in a screen for brain cDNAs
encoding proteins larger than 100 kD. RT-PCR detected expression in all
tissues examined except skeletal muscle. Highest expression was detected
in placenta, lung, liver, and kidney, followed by ovary and small
intestine.

GENE FUNCTION

Dillon et al. (1998) reported that a complete loss of p120(ctn)
expression was observed in approximately 10% of invasive ductal breast
carcinomas investigated.

Wildenberg et al. (2006) found that depletion of p120-catenin in NIH3T3
mouse fibroblasts by small interfering RNA caused constitutive
activation of Rho (RHOA; 165390), cell transformation, loss of contact
inhibition, and growth in the absence of serum. Moreover, Pdgfr and
integrin (see 135630) signaling pathways involved in remodeling the
actin cytoskeleton were selectively impaired. Wildenberg et al. (2006)
traced these effects to obligatory roles of p120-catenin and Arhgap5
(602680) in a pathway that connects Rac (RAC1; 602048) activation to Rho
inhibition. They concluded that p120-catenin and ARHGAP5 use Rho GTPases
to mediate crosstalk between a wide variety of receptors to coordinate
cadherin function with other activities that direct cell adhesion,
motility, and proliferation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Keirsebilck et al. (1998) determined that the human p120(ctn) gene
contains 21 exons, potentially encoding up to 32 protein isoforms as
products of alternative splicing.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Reynolds et al. (1996) determined
that the human gene, symbolized CTNND, is localized immediately adjacent
to the centromere in band 11q11. By interspecific backcross analysis,
they assigned the murine gene, symbolized Catns, to the middle of mouse
chromosome 2. By analysis of radiation hybrids, Nagase et al. (1997)
confirmed that the p120 gene maps to human chromosome 11. By
fluorescence in situ hybridization and analysis of a somatic cell hybrid
mapping panel, Bonne et al. (1998) mapped the CTNND1 gene to chromosome
11q11.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using conditional targeting of p120(ctn) in mouse epidermis,
Perez-Moreno et al. (2006) found that p120-null neonatal epidermis
exhibited reduced intercellular adherens junction components, but no
overt disruption in barrier function or intercellular adhesion. As the
mice aged, they displayed epidermal hypoplasia and chronic inflammation,
typified by hair degeneration and loss of body fat. Use of skin
engraftments and antiinflammatory drugs showed that these features were
not due to reductions in junctional cadherins and catenins, but rather
to NF-kappa-B (see 164011) activation. Both in vivo and in vitro,
p120-null epidermal cells activated NF-kappa-B, triggering a cascade of
proinflammatory NF-kappa-B targets. NF-kappa-B activation in p120-null
keratinocytes was accompanied by alterations in Rho GTPase activity that
appeared to reside upstream from NF-kappa-B activation and downstream
from p120 loss.

601463	TITLE *601463 HYALURONAN SYNTHASE 1; HAS1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan (HA) is a high-molecular-mass
polysaccharide made up of alternating D-glucuronic acid and
D-N-acetylglucosamine residues linked via alternating beta-1,4 and
beta-1,3 glycosidic bonds. Unlike other glycosaminoglycans, HA is
synthesized at the plasma membrane rather than the Golgi by the HA
synthases HAS1, HAS2 (601636), and HAS3 (602428). HA is thought to be
elongated at the reducing, as opposed to the nonreducing, terminus, and
the linear polymer is extruded to the outside of the cell. HA has been
implicated in a wide range of extracellular matrix-mediated processes,
including cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation, and HA may also
function intracellularly (summary by Monslow et al., 2003).

CLONING

Itano and Kimata (1996) used a transient expression system in a mouse
mammary carcinoma cell line lacking HA expression to isolate cDNA clones
capable of restoring HA synthesis activity. The mouse cDNA sequence
identified predicted a 583-amino acid protein with similarity to the
Xenopus DG42 protein and a bacterial HA synthase.

Itano and Kimata (1996) isolated a cDNA encoding human hyaluronan
synthase from a human fetal brain cDNA library by screening with a DNA
probe generated from the coding sequence of murine hyaluronan synthase.
The clone contains a 2,107-bp cDNA insert that is composed of a 1,629-bp
open reading frame and a short segment of the 3-prime untranslated
region. The gene was predicted to encode a 543-amino acid polypeptide.
Comparative analysis of the predicted coding region with the murine
hyaluronan synthase sequence indicated 84.4% and 96.0% identity in
nucleotide sequence and amino acid sequences, respectively. Northern
analysis indicated that the gene is ubiquitously expressed in human
tissues.

Shyjan et al. (1996) also used an expression cloning strategy to obtain
the HAS1 cDNA. However, the reading frame was extended at the 5-prime
end to predict a protein of 578 amino acids.

GENE STRUCTURE

Monslow et al. (2003) determined that the HAS1 gene has 5 coding exons
and spans about 10.9 kb. The 500-bp region upstream of the transcription
start site contains 46 transcription factor-binding sites. The 5-prime
splice junction of intron 1 contains a (GT)n microsatellite repeat
sequence.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid analysis, hybridization to a cosmid contig, and
fluorescence in situ hybridization, Spicer et al. (1997) localized the
human HAS1 gene to chromosome 19q13.3-q13.4. Monslow et al. (2003)
mapped the HAS1 gene to chromosome 19q13.41 by genomic sequence
analysis.

By interspecific backcross analysis, Spicer et al. (1997) mapped the
mouse Has1 gene to chromosome 17.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Cotranslational N-glycosylation of nascent polypeptides in the
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) requires the transfer of a complex
oligosaccharide chain from its dolichyl pyrophosphate (Dol-P-P) carrier
lipid to the nitrogen of an asparagine residue, concomitant with the
release of Dol-P-P into the lumen of the ER. DOLPP1 (EC 3.6.1.43)
converts Dol-P-P to dolichyl phosphate (Dol-P), which is subsequently
translocated to the cytoplasmic leaflet of the ER for regeneration and
participation in subsequent rounds of N-glycosylation (Rush et al.,
2002).

CLONING

Rush et al. (2002) obtained a mouse brain cDNA encoding Dolpp1. The
deduced 238-amino acid protein has 4 putative transmembrane domains and
a consensus lipid-phosphate phosphatase motif. The N and C termini are
predicted to be on the cytosolic face of the ER, and the catalytic
domain is predicted to be on the luminal face of the ER. Northern blot
analysis detected a 2.0-kb transcript in all mouse tissues examined,
with highest expression in brain, kidney, lung, and intestine.
Sedimentation and immunofluorescence analyses revealed that Dolpp1 was
expressed in the ER of transfected COS cells. Protease digestion studies
suggested that the active site was oriented within the lumen of the ER.

GENE FUNCTION

Rush et al. (2002) found that microsomes isolated from yeast or insect
cells expressing mouse Dolpp1 readily dephosphorylated Dol-P-P to Dol-P,
whereas Dol-P and phosphatidic acid were relatively poor substrates.
Expression of mouse Dolpp1 complemented the defect in growth and protein
N-glycosylation in yeast lacking Cwh8, the ortholog of Dolpp1.
Overexpression of either Dolpp1 or Cwh8 in mutant yeast reversed the
accumulation of Dol-P-P.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis and FISH, Gilley and Fried (1999) mapped
the DOLPP1 gene to chromosome 9q34.1.

610663	TITLE *610663 SET AND MYND DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 2; SMYD2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SET domain-containing proteins, such as SMYD2, catalyze lysine
methylation (Brown et al., 2006).

CLONING

By database analysis, Brown et al. (2006) identified mammalian Smyd2.
The deduced 433-amino acid protein has a SET domain that is split into 2
segments by a MYND domain, followed by a cysteine-rich domain. Northern
blot analysis of mouse tissues detected highest expression in heart,
brain, liver, kidney, and ovary. In situ hybridization of day-13.5 mouse
embryos showed Smyd2 expression in heart and hypothalamus.

GENE FUNCTION

Brown et al. (2006) showed that the SET domain of mammalian Smyd2
mediated demethylation of lys36 of histone H3 (see 602810), and Smyd2
repressed transcription from an SV40 reporter plasmid. Exogenous
expression of Smyd2 in mouse fibroblasts decreased cell growth.

Huang et al. (2006) reported that the lysine methyltransferase SMYD2
methylates a previously unidentified site, lys370, in p53 (191170). This
methylation site, in contrast to the known site lys372, is repressing to
p53-mediated transcriptional regulation. SMYD2 helps to maintain low
concentrations of promoter-associated p53. Huang et al. (2006) showed
that reducing SMYD2 concentrations by siRNA enhances p53-mediated
apoptosis. They further found that SET9 (606594)-mediated methylation of
lys372 inhibits SMYD2-mediated methylation of lys370, providing
regulatory crosstalk between posttranslational modifications. In
addition, Huang et al. (2006) showed that the inhibitory effect of
lys372 methylation on lys370 methylation is caused, in part, by blocking
the interaction between p53 and SMYD2. Thus, similar to histones, p53 is
subject to both activating and repressing lysine methylation. Huang et
al. (2006) suggested that their results also predicted that Smyd2 may
function as a putative oncogene by methylating p53 and repressing its
tumor suppressive function.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the SMYD2
gene to chromosome 1 (TMAP SHGC-76339).

607991	TITLE *607991 SOLUTE CARRIER FAMILY 8 (SODIUM-CALCIUM EXCHANGER), MEMBER 3; SLC8A3
;;SODIUM-CALCIUM EXCHANGER 3; NCX3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Plasma membrane sodium-calcium exchangers, such as SLC8A3, are
reversible transporters controlling Ca(2+) homeostasis. The forward
sodium-calcium exchange extrudes 1 Ca(2+) for 3 extracellular Na(+)
ions, using the Na(+) gradient and the electrical potential across the
plasma membrane as an energy source.

CLONING

Nicoll et al. (1996) cloned rat Slc8a3, which they designated Ncx3. The
deduced 927-amino acid protein contains an N-terminal signal peptide, 11
transmembrane segments, a long cytoplasmic loop between transmembrane
segments 5 and 6, and alpha and beta repeat sequences characteristic of
exchange proteins. The authors predicted that the N terminus is
extracellular and the C terminus is intracellular. Slc8a3 contains 5
N-glycosylation sites and 4 phosphorylation sites. Northern blot
analysis of rat tissues detected a 6.0-kb transcript only in brain and
skeletal muscle.

By searching databases for sequences similar to rat Slc8a3, followed by
RT-PCR of neuroblastoma cell line total RNA, Gabellini et al. (2002)
cloned SLC8A3, which they designated NCX3. The deduced 921-amino acid
protein contains an N-terminal cluster of 5 transmembrane domains and a
C-terminal cluster of 5 transmembrane domains. The clusters are
separated by a large hydrophilic intracellular loop. Gabellini et al.
(2002) identified complex alternative splicing in the exons encoding the
intracellular loop. The form expressed in brain and the neuroblastoma
cell line has 7 of 9 exons, lacking exons 3 and 5. In addition to this
isoform, 2 other isoforms were expressed in skeletal muscle: one lacking
only exon 3, and the other lacking exons 3, 4, and 5, resulting in a
terminating frameshift. The predicted proteins range in size from 68 to
100 kD. The coding region of SLC8A3 shares 68% and 71% amino acid
identity with SLC8A1 (182305) and SLC8A2 (601901), respectively, and 97%
identity with rat Slc8a3.

GENE FUNCTION

Nicoll et al. (1996) determined that transfection of rat Slc8a3 into
baby hamster kidney cells mediated a 12-fold increase in Na(+)
gradient-dependent Ca(2+) uptake relative to control cells.

Using promoter-reporter constructs, Gabellini et al. (2002) found that
expression of the SLC8A3 promoter in neuroblastoma cells was promoted by
retinoic acid, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (113505), and rising
cAMP levels. Ca(2+) was inhibitory, and inhibition was mediated by CAMK2
(see 114078)-directed phosphorylation of CREB (see 123810).

GENE STRUCTURE

Gabellini et al. (2002) determined that the SLC8A3 gene contains 9 exons
and spans about 150 kb. Exon 1 is untranslated.

Gabellini et al. (2002) determined that the promoter region of SLC8A3
contains a TATA box and several GC boxes, indicating constitutive
transcription. It also includes binding sites for brain-specific AP2
(107580) transcription factor and for muscle-specific MyoD (159970),
GATA2 (137295), and GATA3 (131320).

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Gabellini et al. (2002) mapped the SLC8A3
gene to chromosome 14q24.2. Nicoll et al. (1996) mapped the mouse Slc8a3
gene to chromosome 12.

ANIMAL MODEL

Sokolow et al. (2004) produced mice deficient in Ncx3. Ncx3-deficient
mice presented a skeletal muscle fiber necrosis and a defective
neuromuscular transmission, reflecting the absence of Ncx3 in the
sarcolemma of the muscle fibers and at the neuromuscular junction. The
defective neuromuscular transmission was characterized by the presence
of electromyographic abnormalities. The findings indicated that NCX3
plays an important role in vivo in the control of Ca(2+) concentrations
in skeletal muscle fibers and at the neuromuscular junction.

Molinaro et al. (2008) demonstrated that homozygous ablation of the Ncx3
gene in mice increased the extent of ischemic brain lesions after middle
cerebral artery occlusion, particularly in the temporoparietal cortex,
compared to controls. Cultured hippocampal cells from Ncx3-deficient
mice showed significantly increased cell death in response to oxygen
glucose deprivation compared to wildtype cells. Hypoxic conditions
increased the reverse mode of the transporter in wildtype cells, but
this reverse current was significantly decreased in Ncx3-deficient
cells. The findings indicated impaired Ca(2+) and Na(+) homeostasis
resulting from absence of Ncx3. Molinaro et al. (2008) noted that NCX3
activity is ATP-independent and can thus function normally even during
ischemic conditions, and suggested that wildtype Ncx3 may have
beneficial effects during hypoxic conditions by decreasing cellular
Na(+) content in the initial stages.

609089	TITLE *609089 F-BOX ONLY PROTEIN 3; FBXO3
;;FBX3;;
FBA
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the F-box protein family, such as FBXO3, are characterized by
an approximately 40-amino acid F-box motif. SCF complexes, formed by
SKP1 (601434), cullin (see CUL1; 603134), and F-box proteins, act as
protein-ubiquitin ligases. F-box proteins interact with SKP1 through the
F box, and they interact with ubiquitination targets through other
protein interaction domains (Jin et al., 2004).

CLONING

Using SKP1 as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen, and by searching an EST
database, Winston et al. (1999) identified a partial FBXO3 cDNA, which
they designated FBX3.

By searching for genes in a region of chromosome 11 associated with WAGR
syndrome (194072), Gawin et al. (1999) identified and cloned FBXO3,
which they designated clone 29944. Northern blot analysis detected
variable expression of a 2.5-kb transcript in all human tissues
examined, with highest expression in heart. Fbxo3 was also detected in
all adult mouse tissues examined. In developing mouse, expression was
low at embryonic day 10 and rose thereafter.

Ilyin et al. (2000) cloned mouse Fbxo3, which they designated Fba. The
deduced 415-amino acid protein contains an N-terminal F box and a
C-terminal domain that shares similarity with bacterial ApaG proteins.

GENE FUNCTION

Winston et al. (1999) showed that in vitro translated FBXO3 interacted
with SKP1 in an in vitro binding assay and in transfected human
embryonic kidney cells.

MAPPING

By analyzing a PAC contig covering chromosome 11p14.1-p13, Gawin et al.
(1999) mapped the FBXO3 gene to chromosome 11p13, centromeric to the
C11ORF41 gene (612297) and telomeric to the LMO2 gene (180385).

Jin et al. (2004) stated that the FBXO3 gene maps to chromosome 11p13
and the mouse Fbxo3 gene maps to chromosome 2E2.0.

614176	TITLE *614176 ZINC FINGER FYVE DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 28; ZFYVE28
;;LST2, C. ELEGANS, ORTHOLOG OF; LST2;;
KIAA1643
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned ZFYVE28, which they designated
KIAA1643. The deduced protein contains 993 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA of
human tissues detected very high ZFYVE28 expression in whole adult
brain, followed by fetal brain, with much lower expression in all other
tissues examined. Within specific adult brain regions, highest
expression was detected in amygdala, caudate nucleus, hippocampus, and
thalamus, followed by substantia nigra and subthalamic nucleus.

By searching a human database for sequences similar to C. elegans Lst2,
Mosesson et al. (2009) identified ZFYVE28, which they called LST2. The
deduced 887-amino acid protein contains a C-terminal FYVE domain and 2
conserved regions, an N-terminal domain, called NDom, and a central
domain, called the CBox. RT-PCR and Western blot analysis of mouse
tissues detected high Lst2 expression in brain. LST2 was also detected
in human cell lines. The most prominent protein had an apparent
molecular mass of 130 to 140 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

Mosesson et al. (2009) found that LST2 regulated internalization and
degradation of EGFR (131550), thereby terminating EGFR signaling. LST2
was monoubiquitinated on lys87 within the NDom domain, and
ubiquitination required the CBox. In the absence of ubiquitination, the
FYVE domain of LST2 bound the endosomal phospholipid
phosphoinositol-3-phosphate (PI3P), and LST2 localized to early
endosomes with EGFR and promoted receptor degradation. Ubiquitination of
LST2 inhibited its PI3P-binding ability and released it from endosomes.
Yeast 2-hybrid analysis of mouse brain lysates showed LST2 also bound
Trim3 (605493), a coordinator of endosomal trafficking.

MAPPING

Using radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (2000) mapped the ZFYVE28
gene to chromosome 4. Mosesson et al. (2009) stated that the ZFYVE28
gene maps to chromosome 4p16.
