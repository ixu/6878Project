610058	TITLE *610058 TUBULIN-SPECIFIC CHAPERONE A; TBCA
;;CHAPERONIN COFACTOR A
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Microtubules are polymers of alpha-tubulin (see TUBA1; 191110) and
beta-tubulin (see TUBB; 191130) that participate in essential cell
functions. A multistep process involving molecular chaperones and
cofactors, including TBCA, produces tubulin heterodimers competent to
polymerize. TBCA specifically interacts with a folding intermediate of
beta-tubulin and acts as a molecular chaperone (Nolasco et al., 2005).

CLONING

By sequencing cDNAs obtained from umbilical cord blood CD34
(142230)-positive hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, Mao et al. (1998)
identified TBCA.

GENE FUNCTION

Tian et al. (1996) found that purified bovine cofactor A formed a stable
complex with beta-tubulin intermediates generated by ATP-dependent
action of the cytosolic chaperonin complex. Through this interaction,
cofactor A appeared to increase the rate of tubulin cycling and,
secondarily, to stimulate the ATPase activity of the complex.

Using small interfering RNA to silence TBCA expression in HeLa and MCF7
mammary carcinoma cell lines, Nolasco et al. (2005) found that TBCA was
essential for cell viability. TBCA knockdown produced a decrease in the
amount of soluble tubulin, modifications in microtubules, and G1 cell
cycle arrest. In MCF7 cells, cell death was preceded by a change in cell
shape resembling differentiation.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid mapping Consortium mapped the TBCA
gene to chromosome 5 (TMAP SHGC-34767).

;;THIOREDOXIN-LIKE PROTEIN p19; TLP19;;
ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM PROTEIN, 18-KD; ERP18;;
ANTERIOR GRADIENT 1, XENOPUS, HOMOLOG OF; AGR1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TXNDC12 belongs to the thioredoxin superfamily (see TXN; 187700).
Members of this superfamily possess a thioredoxin fold with a consensus
active-site sequence (CxxC) and have roles in redox regulation, defense
against oxidative stress, refolding of disulfide-containing proteins,
and regulation of transcription factors (Liu et al., 2003).

CLONING

By searching genomic and EST databases for putative secretory proteins,
followed by RT-PCR of human liver RNA, Liu et al. (2003) cloned TXNDC12,
which they called TLP19. The transcript contains 2 putative poly(A)
signals in its 3-prime UTR. The deduced 172-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 19.2 kD. TLP19 has an N-terminal signal
peptide and a central thioredoxin-like domain containing the consensus
active-site motif. Northern blot analysis detected a 1.6-kb TLP19
transcript in all tissues examined, with highest expression in placenta
and liver. Placenta also expressed a 1.2-kb TLP19 transcript.
Epitope-tagged TLP19 was expressed in the Golgi apparatus of transiently
transfected COS-7 cells, and it was secreted into the culture medium.

Alanen et al. (2003) cloned TXNDC12, which they called ERP18, from a
liver cDNA library. They identified a putative C-terminal endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) retention signal (EDEL) within the deduced protein.
Alanen et al. (2003) also noted that the active-site motif of ERP18
(CGAC) is unlike the catalytic motifs of other thioredoxin superfamily
members, including thioredoxins, isomerases, and oxidating enzymes. The
overall structure of the ERP18 catalytic domain most strongly resembles
those of protein disulfide isomerases (PDI; see 176790). In contrast to
the findings of Liu et al. (2003), Alanen et al. (2003) found that
fluorescence-tagged ERP18 was retained in the ER of transfected COS-7
cells, and the staining did not overlap that of a Golgi marker.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

From circular dichroism and NMR measurements, Alanen et al. (2003)
determined that ERP18 undergoes only a minor conformational change upon
dithiol-disulfide exchange in the active site. Guanidinium chloride
denaturation curves indicated that the reduced form of the protein is
more stable than the oxidized form, suggesting that ERP18 is involved in
disulfide bond formation.

GENE FUNCTION

Liu et al. (2003) found that recombinant TLP19 without the signal
peptide showed reducing activity against an insulin-disulfide substrate.

Alanen et al. (2003) found that ERP18 showed significant peptide
thiol-disulfide oxidase activity in vitro, and the activity was
dependent on the presence of both active-site cysteines. The activity
differed from that of the human PDI family in that it was limited by
substrate oxidation and not by enzyme reoxidation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Liu et al. (2003) determined that the TLP19 gene contains 7 exons and
spans more than 35 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Liu et al. (2003) mapped the TLP19 gene to
chromosome 1p32.3.

614277	TITLE *614277 UBIQUITIN-CONJUGATING ENZYME 2W; UBE2W
;;UBC16, ARABIDOPSIS, HOMOLOG OF; UBC16
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Ubiquitination is a common posttranslational modification that plays
roles in many cellular pathways and in protein degradation. Conjugation
of ubiquitin to substrate proteins requires an E1 ubiquitin-activating
enzyme (e.g., UBE1; 314370), an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (e.g.,
UBE2A; 312180), and an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase (e.g., UBE3A;
601623). UBE2W is an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (summary by Zhang
et al., 2011).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a human fetal brain cDNA library, Yin
et al. (2006) cloned UBE2W, which they called UBC16. The deduced
162-amino acid protein has an approximately 150-amino acid catalytic
core, termed the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (UBC) domain, which
contains 2 nuclear localization signals at its C-terminal end. Human
UBC16 shares 51% amino acid identity with Arabidopsis Ubc16. RT-PCR
detected ubiquitous UBC16 expression, with highest expression in heart,
brain, liver, and pancreas. Fluorescence-tagged UBC16 localized to
nuclei of transfected HEK293 cells.

GENE FUNCTION

By mutation analysis, Yin et al. (2006) showed that nuclear localization
of human UBC in transfected HEK293 cells required both the nuclear
localization signals and enzyme activity.

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Zhang et al. (2011) showed that mouse
Ube2w interacted with Fancl (608111), an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in
DNA damage repair. They confirmed the interaction by protein pull-down
and coimmunoprecipitation analyses. Fancl showed a ubiquitous
intracellular localization in the absence of Ube2w and a nuclear
localization in the presence of Ube2w. Ube2w formed nuclear homodimers.
Ube2w exhibited ubiquitin-conjugating activity and monoubiquitinated the
PHD domain of Fancl in vitro. Ubiquitination by Ube2w required a
conserved active-site cysteine within its ubiquitin-conjugating domain.
Ube2w also monoubiquitinated Fancd2 (613984). Downregulation of UBE2W in
human cell lines markedly reduced FANCD2 monoubiquitination caused by
ultraviolet irradiation, but not FANCD2 monoubiquitination caused by the
DNA crosslinking agent mitomycin C or FANCD2 monoubiquitination that
occurs normally during S phase.

GENE STRUCTURE

Yin et al. (2006) determined that the UBE2W gene contains 7 exons and
spans 8.6 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Yin et al. (2006) mapped the UBE2W gene to
chromosome 8q13-q21.1.

103020	TITLE *103020 ADENYLATE KINASE 2; AK2
;;ADENYLATE KINASE, MITOCHONDRIAL MYOKINASE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Nucleoside monophosphate kinases, including adenylate kinases, catalyze
the reversible phosphorylation between nucleoside triphosphates and
monophosphates.

CLONING

Bruns and Regina (1977) analyzed the subcellular compartmentalization of
adenylate kinase-2 (EC 2.7.4.3) in HeLa cells, mouse RAG cells, and
RAG-human hybrids expressing human AK2. The results indicated that AK2
is a mitochondrial enzyme.

Noma et al. (1998) isolated cDNAs encoding human adenylate kinase-2 from
a HeLa cell cDNA library, using bovine AK2 cDNA as probe. Two
transcripts were identified: one, designated AK2A, encodes a deduced
239-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 26.5 kD, and
the other, designated AK2B, encodes a deduced 232-amino acid protein
with a predicted molecular mass of 25.6 kD. Northern blot analysis
demonstrated 3 strong hybridizing signals of 0.9 (AK2A), 1.7 (AK2B), and
3.5 kb, with high expression in liver, heart, skeletal muscle, and
pancreas, moderate expression in kidney, placenta, and brain, and weak
expression in lung. However, Western blot analysis showed high levels of
AK2 protein in liver, heart, and kidney, low levels in lung, and
undetectable levels in brain and skeletal muscle.

MAPPING

The existence of a second adenylate kinase locus linked to PGM1 and
peptidase C, i.e., on chromosome 1, was suggested by cell hybridization
studies by Van Cong et al. (1972). The Goss-Harris method of mapping
combines features of recombinational study in families and synteny tests
in hybrid cells. As applied to chromosome 1, the method shows that AK2
and UMPK are distal to PGM1 and that the order of the loci is PGM1:
UMPK: (AK2, alpha-FUC): ENO1 (Goss and Harris, 1977). Carritt et al.
(1982) presented evidence that AK2 is in 1p34.

GENE FUNCTION

Lee et al. (2007) showed that intrinsic apoptosis in human cells that
was induced by the chemotherapeutic agent etoposide or the antibiotic
staurosporine, but not by FAS ligand (TNFSF6; 134638) or TRAIL (TNFSF10;
603598), caused translocation of AK2 from mitochondria to the cytoplasm,
followed by formation of a complex between AK2, FADD (602457), and
CASP10 (601762). Yeast 2-hybrid analysis, protein pull-down assays, and
immunoprecipitation analysis showed that the N- and C-terminal domains
of AK2, which include nucleoside- and substrate-binding domains,
respectively, bound the C-terminal death domain of FADD. AK2 binding
promoted association of CASP10 with FADD, and addition of purified AK2
protein to cell extracts induced activation of CASP10 via FADD, leading
to subsequent activation of CASP9 (602234) and CASP3 (600636). Apoptosis
through the AK2 complex did not correlate with the adenylate kinase
activity of AK2, did not require CASP8 (601763)-mediated apoptotic
responses, and did not involve mitochondrial cytochrome c release.
Immunodepletion or knockdown of AK2, FADD, or CASP10 abrogated
etoposide-induced apoptosis, and AK2 complexes were not observed in
several etoposide-resistant human tumor cell lines that were deficient
in expression of FADD, CASP10, or CASP3. In contrast to the findings in
human cells, etoposide-induced apoptosis was observed in mouse embryonic
fibroblasts that lacked Fadd expression. Since mice also lack Casp10,
Lee et al. (2007) concluded that mice lack an apoptotic pathway
comparable to the AK2-FADD-CASP10 pathway in humans.

Pannicke et al. (2009) showed that knockdown of zebrafish ak2 also leads
to aberrant leukocyte development, demonstrating the evolutionarily
conserved role of AK2. They concluded that their results provide in vivo
evidence for AK2 selectivity in leukocyte differentiation.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 6 affected individuals from 5 families segregating reticular
dysgenesis (267500), Pannicke et al. (2009) identified 6 causative
mutations in homozygous or compound heterozygous state
(103020.0001-103020.0006).

Lagresle-Peyrou et al. (2009) identified biallelic mutations in AK2
(103020.0007-103020.0013) in 7 individuals with reticular dysgenesis.
These mutations resulted in absent or strongly decreased protein
expression. The authors then demonstrated that restoration of AK2
expression in the bone marrow cells of individuals with reticular
dysgenesis overcomes the neutrophil differentiation arrest, underlining
its specific requirement in the development of a restricted set of
hematopoietic lineages. Finally, Lagresle-Peyrou et al. (2009)
established that AK2 is specifically expressed in the stria vascularis
region of the inner ear, which provides an explanation for the
sensorineural deafness in these individuals. Lagresle-Peyrou et al.
(2009) concluded that their results identified a previously unknown
mechanism involved in regulation of hematopoietic cell differentiation
in one of the most severe human immunodeficiency syndromes.

138760	TITLE *138760 HYDROXYACYL GLUTATHIONE HYDROLASE; HAGH
;;GLYOXALASE II; GLO2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Glyoxalase II (EC 3.1.2.6), otherwise known as hydroxyacyl-glutathione
hydrolase, converts the intermediate substrate S-lactoyl-glutathione to
reduced glutathione and D-lactate (summary by Honey and Shows, 1981).

CLONING

Ridderstrom et al. (1996) cloned a cDNA coding for glyoxalase II from
human liver. The 1,011-bp sequence contains a full-length coding region
of 780 basepairs, corresponding to a 260-amino acid polypeptide. The
calculated molecular mass of the protein is 28,861 Da. They expressed
the gene in bacteria and the recombinant enzyme showed a kinetic
behavior indistinguishable from that of the native enzyme.

MAPPING

By study of somatic cell hybrids, Honey and Shows (1981) concluded that
the gene for glyoxalase II is on chromosome 16. Mulley and Callen (1986)
confirmed the assignment of HAGH to chromosome 16 by studies of a
human-mouse hybrid panel. They found that both HAGH and phosphoglycolate
phosphatase (PGP; 172280) were present only in those cell lines
containing 16p13.

Mulley et al. (1990) assigned the HAGH locus to 16p13.3 by
electrophoretic detection of enzymes from a mouse/human somatic cell
panel, the members of which carried portions of human chromosome 16 with
precisely defined breakpoints.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Board (1980) described rare polymorphism of glyoxalase II, observed only
in a Micronesian population, in which a new variant allele had a
frequency of 0.016. In the heterozygotes, the electrophoretic pattern
was a double band, suggesting that the structure of glyoxalase II is
monomeric. The enzyme shows a high degree of polymorphism in anthropoid
primates (Board et al., 1981).

Data on gene frequencies of allelic variants were tabulated by
Roychoudhury and Nei (1988).

610152	TITLE *610152 CENTROMERIC PROTEIN M; CENPM
;;PROLIFERATION-ASSOCIATED NUCLEAR ELEMENT 1; PANE1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The centromere is a specialized chromatin domain, present throughout the
cell cycle, that acts as a platform on which the transient assembly of
the kinetochore occurs during mitosis. All active centromeres are
characterized by the presence of long arrays of nucleosomes in which
CENPA (117139) replaces histone H3 (see 602810). CENPM is an additional
factor required for centromere assembly (Foltz et al., 2006).

CLONING

By searching databases for homologs of mouse Pane1, Bierie et al. (2004)
identified human CENPM, which they called PANE1. The deduced protein
contains 180 amino acids. In silico analysis suggested that PANE1 was
expressed predominantly in cancer tissues. Dot and Northern blot
analyses revealed highest expression of a 1.2-kb transcript in fetal
liver, thymus, and spleen, as well as in lymphoid cells and tumor cell
lines, including B- and T-cell leukemias. PANE1 was expressed in
activated, but not resting, B and T lymphocytes. Immunofluorescence
microscopy showed nuclear localization of PANE1 in nonconfluent culture
cells, but not in confluent or dividing cells.

Brickner et al. (2006) identified a novel minor histocompatibility
antigen (mHAg) recognized by a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte clone derived from
a hemopoietic cell transplant recipient. By database analysis, they
determined that the mHAg is encoded by 1 of 11 variants of PANE1. The
variant, designated transcript K, contains a unique first exon and a
second exon common to 5 of the longer PANE1 variants, including
transcript C, which encodes the full-length form. Transcript K encodes a
58-amino acid protein whose 46 C-terminal amino acids are identical to
those of the full-length protein. Immunogenicity of the mHAg resulted
from a nonsense SNP in the unique exon 1 of transcript K. Quantitative
RT-PCR analysis detected selective expression of transcript K in
B-lymphoid cells, with highest expression in resting B cells and B-cell
chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells. Transcript C was selectively
expressed in activated B cells, suggesting a reciprocal expression
pattern for transcripts K and C. Brickner et al. (2006) proposed that
PANE1 is a potential therapeutic target in B-lineage chronic lymphocytic
leukemia.

GENE STRUCTURE

Bierie et al. (2004) determined that the CENPM gene contains 6 exons and
spans 8.4 kb.

GENE FUNCTION

By immunoprecipitation of CENPA-containing complexes from HeLa cells,
followed by multiple tandem affinity purifications, Foltz et al. (2006)
identified CENPM as a component of a CENPA nucleosome-associated
complex. Epitope-tagged CENPM bound to centromeres throughout interphase
and during mitosis. CENPM, CENPN (611509), CENPT (611510), and CENPU
(MLF1IP; 611511), together with CENPC (117141) and CENPH (605607), bound
CENPA in a proximal nucleosome-associated complex. Small interfering RNA
(siRNA)-mediated depletion of CENPM disrupted recruitment of the core
complex, caused the loss of CENPN from centromeres, and increased the
number of cells in mitosis.

Okada et al. (2006) found that chicken B cells expressing a conditional
Cenpm deletion stopped proliferating and died following induction of the
deletion. Cenpm deletion led to loss of centromeric localization of
Cenph, Cenpi, Cenpk (611502), and Cenpl (611503), and while preexisting
Cenpa was stable, incorporation of newly synthesized Cenpa into
centromeres appeared defective in mutant cells.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Brickner et al. (2006) mapped the CENPM
gene to chromosome 22q13.31, about 12 kb from the TNFRSF13C gene
(606269).

605255	TITLE *605255 ETS VARIANT GENE 7; ETV7
;;ETS TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR TEL2; TEL2;;
TELB
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The ETS (E26 transformation-specific) family of transcription factors,
of which ETV7 is a member, is a large group of evolutionarily conserved
transcriptional regulators that play an important role in a variety of
cellular processes throughout development and differentiation, and are
involved in oncogenesis as well (Potter et al., 2000).

CLONING

Potter et al. (2000) sequenced cDNA clones corresponding to a novel ETS
gene from an activated T-cell cDNA library, as well as from breast
tissue and meningioma cDNA libraries. The cDNA, which the authors
designated TEL2, encodes a deduced 341-amino acid protein that shares
38% sequence identity with TEL1 (ETV6; 600618). TEL2 contains a
C-terminal ETS domain and an N-terminal PNT domain, which is thought to
mediate protein-protein interactions. Northern blot analysis revealed
expression of TEL2 mRNA predominantly in hematopoietic tissues; a
predominant band of approximately 1.2 kb was present in fetal liver and
bone marrow and was faintly present in peripheral blood leukocytes.
Using antibodies raised against the C terminus of the TEL2 protein,
Potter et al. (2000) showed that TEL2 localizes to the nucleus. The
striking similarities of TEL2 to TEL1, its expression in hematopoietic
tissues, and its ability to associate with TEL1 suggested that TEL2 may
be an important hematopoietic regulatory protein.

Poirel et al. (2000) identified the TELB gene by comparison of the TEL
sequence with genomic sequence databases. Northern blot analysis
detected ubiquitous expression of TELB.

GENE STRUCTURE

Potter et al. (2000) determined that the TEL2 gene contains 8 exons
spanning approximately 21 kb.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization and by inclusion within a PAC
clone, Potter et al. (2000) mapped the TEL2 gene to chromosome 6p21.

Poirel et al. (2000) mapped the TELB gene to 6p21 by genomic sequence
analysis.

602731	TITLE *602731 FYN-BINDING PROTEIN; FYB
;;SLAP130;;
p120/130;;
ADHESION AND DEGRANULATION ADAPTOR PROTEIN; ADAP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

T-cell receptor signaling involves activation of the src
protein-tyrosine kinases LCK (153390) and FYN (137025), leading to the
phosphorylation of various substrates including SLP76 (LCP2; 601603). Da
Silva et al. (1993) identified FYB (called p120/130 by them), a 120- and
130-kD protein doublet that associates with the SH2 domain of FYN.
T-cell receptor ligation led to increased tyrosine phosphorylation of
FYB. Da Silva et al. (1997) showed that the 120- and 130-kD doublet is
composed of 2 related isoforms of FYB. In T cells from FYN mutant mice,
the phosphorylation of FYB was reduced, but not abolished, suggesting to
da Silva et al. (1997) that FYB could be phosphorylated by another
kinase. By screening a Jurkat T-cell line expression library with
antibodies against FYB, da Silva et al. (1997) identified FYB cDNAs.
Northern blot analysis revealed that the 4.5-kb FYB mRNA is expressed
only in myeloid and T cells. Expression of FYB in mammalian cells
yielded a protein that migrated at 120 kD on SDS-PAGE. By Western
blotting, da Silva et al. (1997B) showed that FYB coimmunoprecipitated
with FYN and with SLP76 in mammalian cell lysates. They concluded that
FYB acts as a component of the FYN and SLP76 signaling cascades in T
cells.

Musci et al. (1997) cloned cDNAs encoding SLAP130, a 130-kD
phosphoprotein that is associated with SLP76. Da Silva et al. (1997)
stated that SLAP130 is identical to FYB except for 2 conservative and 1
nonconservative amino acid substitutions. Musci et al. (1997) attributed
the difference between the calculated mass of SLAP130 (86 kD) and the
observed mass by SDS-PAGE (130 kD) to posttranslational modifications or
the abundance of charged amino acids.

Da Silva et al. (1997) used the human FYB cDNA to clone the mouse
homolog. The sequence of the predicted 783-amino acid human FYB protein
shares 77% identity with that of mouse FYB.

GENE FUNCTION

By immunoblot analysis, Geng et al. (2001) showed that FCER1A (147140)
aggregation induces rapid FYB tyrosine phosphorylation in rat basophilic
leukemia mast cells and the release of beta hexosaminidase (see 606873).
Confocal microscopy demonstrated that FYB colocalizes with actin (see
ACTA1; 102610) in membrane ruffles. FYB overexpression enhanced mast
cell adhesion to fibronectin (FN1; 135600) and SH3 domain-mediated
release of beta hexosaminidase, implying increased histamine release as
well. Mast cell adhesion had no effect on FYB phosphorylation but
enhanced beta hexosaminidase release.

Medeiros et al. (2007) presented evidence for a previously unrecognized
function for ADAP in regulating T-cell receptor (TCR)-mediated
activation of the transcription factor NF-kappa-B (see 164011).
Stimulation of ADAP-deficient mouse T cells with antibodies to CD3 (see
186740) and CD28 (186760) resulted in impaired nuclear translocation of
NF-kappa-B, a reduced DNA binding, and delayed degradation and decreased
phosphorylation of I-kappa-B (see 164008). TCR-stimulated assembly of
the CARMA1 (607210)-BCL10 (603517)-MALT1 (604860) complex was
substantially impaired in the absence of ADAP. Medeiros et al. (2007)
further identified a region of ADAP that is required for association
with the CARMA1 adaptor and NF-kappa-B activation but is not required
for ADAP-dependent regulation of adhesion.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using gene targeting strategies, Griffiths et al. (2001) and Peterson et
al. (2001) each generated mice lacking Fyb expression in mature T
lymphocytes. Although lymphocyte development was normal in these mice,
splenic CD4 (186940)-positive and CD8 (see 186910)-positive T-cell
numbers were reduced, suggesting that Fyb may be required for peripheral
T-cell homeostasis. T-cell proliferation in response to phorbol ester
was normal in Fyb-deficient cells, but responses to anti-CD3E (186830),
with or without anti-CD28 (186760), were reduced, as were cytokine
production and activation marker upregulation. These results
demonstrated that Fyb acts as a positive regulator of T-cell activation.
Fyb-deficient mice also had reduced antibody production to T-dependent
antigens in vivo. Although downstream signaling pathways and antigen
receptor clustering were normal, clustering of the integrin LFA1 (see
153370 and 600065) was not. Flow chamber analysis demonstrated that
anti-CD3E-stimulated but not phorbol ester-stimulated Fyb-deficient T
cells were defective in adhering to mouse Icam1 (147840), to human ICAM2
(146630), and to other substrates mediated by integrins, although
integrin expression was not reduced. Using confocal microscopy, Peterson
et al. (2001) showed that Fyb-deficient T cells had normal clustering of
actin but no polarization of LFA1, whereas LFA1 clustering was markedly
increased in wildtype T cells. Griffiths et al. (2001) concluded that
the T-cell receptor-induced adhesion defect in integrin activation was
due to a block in 'inside-out' signaling between the T-cell receptor and
integrins. Peterson et al. (2001) and Griffiths et al. (2001) proposed
that on the basis of these findings and studies by Geng et al. (2001),
which implicated FYB in vasoactive mediator release, that FYB be
redesignated 'adhesion and degranulation adaptor protein,' or ADAP.

606649	TITLE *606649 HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS TYPE 1 ENHANCER-BINDING PROTEIN 3; HIVEP3
;;ZAS FAMILY, MEMBER 3; ZAS3;;
KRC, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF; KRC;;
SCHNURRI, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, 3; SHN3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the ZAS family, such as ZAS3 (HIVEP3), are large proteins
that contain a ZAS domain, a modular protein structure consisting of a
pair of C2H2 zinc fingers with an acidic-rich region and a
serine/threonine -rich sequence. These proteins bind specific DNA
sequences, including the kappa-B motif (GGGACTTTCC), in the promoters
and enhancer regions of several genes and viruses, including human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV). ZAS genes span more than 150 kb and
contain at least 10 exons, one of which is longer than 5.5 kb (summary
by Allen and Wu, 2004).

CLONING

Hicar et al. (2001) cloned HIVEP3, a member of the HIVEP family (see
HIVEP1; 194540). HIVEPs encode large zinc finger proteins and regulate
transcription via the kappa-B enhancer motif. HIVEP3 is homologous to
the mouse Krc (kappa-B-binding and recognition component of the V(D)J
recombination signal sequence) protein. The largest open reading frame
of HIVEP3 contains 2,406 amino acids and is 80% identical to Krc. RNA
studies showed that multiple HIVEP3 transcripts are differentially
expressed and regulated. Transcription termination occurs in the
ultimate exon, exon 10, or in exon 6. Therefore, HIVEP3 may produce
protein isoforms that contain or exclude the C-terminal DNA-binding
domain and the leucine zipper by alternative RNA splicing and
differential polyadenylation.

GENE FUNCTION

Oukka et al. (2002) described a function for the zinc finger
transcription factor Krc in regulating patterns of gene activation in
response to proinflammatory stimuli. Krc overexpression inhibited, while
antisense or dominant-negative Krc enhanced, NF-kappa-B (NFKB; see
164011)-dependent transactivation and JNK (601158) phosphorylation and
consequently inhibited apoptosis and cytokine gene expression. The
effect of Krc was mediated through its interaction with the adaptor
protein TRAF2 (601895). Oukka et al. (2002) concluded that Krc is a
participant in the signal transduction pathway leading from the TNF
receptor (see 602746) to gene activation and may play a critical role in
inflammatory and apoptotic responses.

Hong et al. (2003) found an absence of non-Rel kappa-B protein and
constitutive nuclear expression and activation of the NFKB p65 subunit
(RELA; 164014) in immortalized pre-B-cell lines from a malignant mouse
teratoma that spontaneously developed in a Zas3 -/- Rag2 (179616) -/-
mouse. The results suggested that ZAS3 modulates NFKB transcriptional
activation.

Using T-cell lines, Oukka et al. (2004) showed that KRC was induced by
T-cell receptor (TCR; see 186880) signaling and enhanced IL2 (147680)
production by binding to JUN (165160) and coactivating AP1 (165160),
which bound the IL2 promoter.

Jones et al. (2006) showed that Schnurri-3 (Shn3), a mammalian homolog
of the Drosophila zinc-finger adaptor protein Shn, is an essential
regulator of adult bone formation. Mice lacking Shn3 display adult-onset
osteosclerosis with increased bone mass due to augmented osteoblast
activity. Shn3 was found to control protein levels of Runx2 (600211),
the principal transcriptional regulator of osteoblast differentiation,
by promoting its degradation through recruitment of the E3 ubiquitin
ligase WWP1 (602037) to Runx2. By this means, Runx2-mediated
extracellular matrix mineralization was antagonized, revealing an
essential role for Shn3 as a central regulator of postnatal bone mass.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Hicar et al. (2001) determined that the
HIVEP3 gene spans at least 300 kb and has 10 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Hicar et al. (2001) mapped the HIVEP3 gene
to chromosome 1p34.

ANIMAL MODEL

By deleting exon 2 of the Krc gene, Oukka et al. (2004) generated mice
lacking the Krc protein but retaining normal lymphoid development and
CD4 T-cell numbers and CD4 T-cell maturation markers. CD4 T cells from
Krc -/- mice produced significantly less IL2 after TCR stimulation, but
were able to respond to exogenous IL2 with normal Ifng (147570)
production.

Jones et al. (2010) stated that Shn2 (HIVEP2; 143054) -/- mice display a
modest low-turnover osteopenia due to reduced osteoclast and osteoblast
function, whereas Shn3 -/- mice show severe osteosclerosis due to
increased osteoblast activity and elevated rate of bone formation. Jones
et al. (2010) found that Shn2 -/- Shn3 -/- double-knockout mice
displayed severe growth retardation resulting in dwarfism and did not
survive beyond 3 weeks of age. Shn2 -/- Shn3 -/- skeletal defects were
due to shortening of both axial and appendicular skeletons, incomplete
formation of thoracic vertebrae, impaired sternum development, and
shortening of proximal and distal limb bones. Increased bone mass in
Shn2 -/- Shn3 -/- mice was similar to that observed in Shn3 -/- mice and
was due to elevated osteoblast activity. Complete ablation of both Shn2
and Shn3 was necessary to perturb growth plate maturation, whereas
deletion of a single Shn3 allele was sufficient to cause increased bone
mass, which could be augmented by deletion of an Shn2 allele.

192225	TITLE *192225 VASCULAR CELL ADHESION MOLECULE 1; VCAM1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, a cell surface glycoprotein expressed
by cytokine-activated endothelium, mediates the adhesion of monocytes
and lymphocytes (Cybulsky et al., 1991). In inflammatory conditions and
in cardiac allografts undergoing rejection, VCAM1 is upregulated in
endothelium of postcapillary venules. Arterial expression of VCAM1 is
also found in experimental models of atherosclerosis in the rabbit.

GENE STRUCTURE

Cybulsky et al. (1991) demonstrated that VCAM1 is present in single copy
in the human genome and contains 9 exons spanning about 25 kb of DNA. At
least 2 different VCAM1 precursors can be generated from the human gene
as a result of alternative mRNA splicing events, which include or
exclude exon 5.

MAPPING

Cybulsky et al. (1991) mapped the VCAM1 gene to chromosome 1 by Southern
analysis of somatic cell hybrids. A study of 2 hybrid lines carrying
translocations involving chromosome 1 permitted regionalization to
1p34-p21. Fluorescence in situ hybridization to metaphase chromosomes
further narrowed the localization to 1p32-p31. (Another endothelial
leukocyte adhesion molecule, ELAM1 (131210), is located on chromosome 1,
but on the long arm.)

Kumar et al. (1994) mapped the murine Vcam1 gene to chromosome 3 near
Amy1.

GENE FUNCTION

In a review of molecular pathways controlling heart development, Olson
and Srivastava (1996) cited studies indicating that deficiencies of the
cell adhesion molecules VCAM and alpha-4 integrin (192975) result in
epicardial dissolution and subsequent myocardial thinning.

Lu and Cyster (2002) studied the mechanisms that control localization of
marginal zone B cells. They demonstrated that marginal zone B cells
express elevated levels of the integrins LFA1 (see 153370/600065) and
alpha-4 (192975)-beta-1 (135630), and that the marginal zone B cells
bind to the ligands ICAM1 (147840) and VCAM1. These ligands are
expressed within the marginal zone in a lymphotoxin-dependent manner.
Combined inhibition of LFA1 and alpha-4-beta-1 causes a rapid and
selective release of B cells from the marginal zone. Furthermore,
lipopolysaccharide-triggered marginal zone B cell relocalization
involves downregulation of integrin-mediated adhesion. Lu and Cyster
(2002) concluded that their studies identified key requirements for
marginal zone B cell localization and established a role for integrins
in peripheral lymphoid tissue compartmentalization.

Garmy-Susini et al. (2005) demonstrated that integrin alpha-4-beta-1 and
VCAM1 are expressed by proliferating but not quiescent endothelial cells
and mural cells, respectively. Antagonists of this integrin-ligand pair
blocked the adhesion of mural cells to proliferating endothelia in vitro
and in vivo, thereby inducing apoptosis of endothelial cells and
pericytes and inhibiting neovascularization. Garmy-Susini et al. (2005)
concluded that integrin alpha-4-beta-1 and VCAM1 facilitate a critical
cell-cell adhesion event required for survival of endothelial and mural
cells during vascularization.

Garrison et al. (2005) described cotransin, a small molecule that
inhibits protein translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum. Cotransin
acts in a signal-sequence-discriminatory manner to prevent the stable
insertion of select nascent chains (specifically VCAM1, and P-selectin,
173610) into the Sec61 translocation channel. Garrison et al. (2005)
concluded that the range of substrates accommodated by the channel can
be specifically and reversibly modulated by a cell-permeable small
molecule that alters the interaction between signal sequences and the
Sec61 complex. This has various implications for drug development.

Besemer et al. (2005) developed a very similar VCAM1 depressing agent,
which they called CAM741. CAM741 works similar to cotransin in that it
represses the biosynthesis of VCAM1 cells by blocking the process of
cotranslational translocation, which is dependent on the signal peptide
of VCAM1. CAM741 does not inhibit targeting of the VCAM1 nascent chains
to the translocon channel but prevents translocation to the luminal side
of the endoplasmic reticulum through a process that involves the
translocon component Sec61-beta (609214). Consequently, the VCAM1
precursor protein is synthesized towards the cytosolic compartment of
the cells, where it is degraded.

By in vivo selection, transcriptomic analysis, functional verification,
and clinical validation, Minn et al. (2005) identified a set of genes
that marks and mediates breast cancer metastasis to the lungs. Some of
these genes serve dual functions, providing growth advantages both in
the primary tumor and in the lung microenvironment. Others contribute to
aggressive growth selectivity in the lung. Among the lung metastasis
signature genes identified, several, including VCAM1, were functionally
validated. Those subjects expressing the lung metastasis signature had a
significantly poorer lung metastasis-free survival, but not bone
metastasis-free survival, compared to subjects without the signature.

Campbell et al. (2006) found that increased serum levels of soluble
VCAM1 predicted recurrent ischemic stroke (601367) in a study of 252
patients. A smaller but similar trend was noted for serum levels of
N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NPPB; 600295). Patients in
the highest quarters for both sVCAM1 and NT-proBNP levels had 3.6 times
the risk of recurrent ischemic stroke compared to patients in the lowest
quarters for both biologic markers.

By database analysis, Harris et al. (2008) identified a potential target
sequence for miR126 (MIRN126; 611767), a microRNA selectively expressed
in endothelial cells, in the 3-prime UTR of VCAM1. Transfection of human
endothelial cells with antisense miR126 permitted an increase in
TNF-alpha (TNF; 191160)-stimulated VCAM1 expression. Conversely,
overexpression of the miR126 precursor increased miR126 levels and
decreased VCAM1 expression. Decreasing endogenous miR126 levels
increased leukocyte adherence to endothelial cells. Harris et al. (2008)
concluded that miR126 inhibits VCAM1 expression.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Taylor et al. (2002) identified 33 SNPs in the VCAM1 locus. They then
analyzed a subset of these SNPs in 51 cases of stroke in sickle cell
disease (603903) patients derived from a single institution in Jamaica
and in 51 matched controls. They found that the C variant allele of the
nonsynonymous SNP 1238G-C, which results in a gly413-to-ala amino acid
change (G413A), may be associated with protection from stroke (odds
ratio = 0.35). Dover (2002) stated that sickle cell disease is not a
single gene disorder and emphasized the need for further studies of the
relationship of VCAM1 to strokes in this disorder.

Idelman et al. (2007) stated that VCAM1 transcription induction is
highly dependent on cell and organ type and mode of stimulation by
various transcription factors. The authors identified 8 VCAM1 promoter
haplotypes comprising 13 SNPs previously identified by Taylor et al.
(2002) in African Americans. Functional cellular expression studies in T
cells stimulated by T-cell mitogens assessed the inducibility of
expression of the different haplotypes. A -540A-G SNP (dbSNP rs3783605)
was found to gain an ETS2 (164740)-binding site, which was postulated by
Idelman et al. (2007) to have functional importance.

608692	TITLE *608692 BASIC LEUCINE ZIPPER NUCLEAR FACTOR 1; BLZF1
;;JEM1;;
GOLGIN 45
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By differential display to identify transcripts upregulated following
retinoic acid stimulation of a promyelocytic leukemia cell line (NB4)
cDNA library, Duprez et al. (1997) cloned BLZF1, which they designated
JEM1. The deduced 400-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass
of 45 kD. The N-terminal region of JEM1 is followed by a basic region
containing a nuclear localization signal; a hinge region; a leucine
zipper dimerization motif; and a C-terminal PEST motif. JEM1 also
contains several phosphorylation sites. Northern blot analysis detected
a 3.0-kb transcript in T-cell leukemia, pro-B, pre-B, myeloma, and
plasmacytoma cell lines, but not in Burkitt lymphoma cells. Expression
of JEM1 was also detected in several normal tissues, including adrenal
gland. Epitope-tagged JEM1 was expressed in a punctate staining pattern
in the nuclei of transfected COS-7 cells; it was excluded from nucleoli.
SDS-PAGE of in vitro translated cDNA detected JEM1 at an apparent
molecular mass of 42 kD.

By analyzing ESTs, Tong et al. (2000) determined that JEM1 is expressed
ubiquitously. They identified a JEM1 splice variant, designated JEM1s,
generated by exon 3 extension and polyadenylation. The deduced 174-amino
acid JEM1s protein lacks the leucine repeat, the PEST domain, and
several terminal phosphorylation sites. Northern blot analysis detected
both variants in NB4 cell RNA. Western blot analysis of transfected cell
lysates detected JEM1s at an apparent molecular mass of 23 kD. Confocal
analysis of transfected cells showed that JEM1s localized to the
cytoplasm rather than the nucleus.

GENE FUNCTION

Duprez et al. (1997) found that expression of JEM1 was enhanced in NB4
cells 24 to 72 hours after retinoic acid treatment, prior to sudden
growth arrest.

Tong et al. (2000) determined that retinoids increased reporter
transcript expression in HeLa cells transfected with JEM1.

Short et al. (2001) presented evidence that mammalian Blzf1, which they
designated golgin-45, interacts with the medial-Golgi matrix protein
Grasp55 (608693) and with the GTP-bound form of Rab2 (179509), but not
with other Golgi Rab proteins. Depletion of Blzf1 disrupted the Golgi
apparatus and caused a block in secretory protein transport. Short et
al. (2001) concluded that Grasp55 and Blzf1 form a Rab2 effector complex
on medial Golgi essential for normal protein transport and Golgi
structure.

GENE STRUCTURE

Duprez et al. (1997) determined that the 5-prime UTR of BLZF1 contains
typical Sp1 (189906) enhancer elements. The 3-prime UTR contains 3
polyadenylation sequences.

Tong et al. (2000) determined that the BLZF1 gene contains 7 exons and
spans more than 34 kb. The promoter region lacks a TATA box, Inr motifs,
or DPE motifs, but it contains a typical CCAAT box. BLZF1 has cis-acting
elements for several transcriptional regulators, but no retinoic acid
receptor (see 180240) elements or retinoid X receptor (see 180245)
elements. The 3-prime UTR region upstream of the polyadenylation sites
contains numerous repetitive elements.

MAPPING

By FISH, Duprez et al. (1997) mapped the BLZF1 gene to chromosome 1q24.

103180	TITLE *103180 ADP-RIBOSYLATION FACTOR 1; ARF1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs), such as ARF1, are small guanine
nucleotide-binding proteins that enhance the enzymatic activities of
cholera toxin. ARFs are essential and ubiquitous in eukaryotes, being
involved in vesicular transport and functioning as activators of
phospholipase D. The functions of ARF proteins in membrane traffic and
organelle integrity are intimately tied to their reversible association
with membranes and specific interactions with membrane phospholipids. A
common feature of these functions is their regulation by the binding and
hydrolysis of GTP (summary by Bobak et al. (1989) and Amor et al.
(1994)).

CLONING

Bobak et al. (1989) cloned 2 ARF cDNAs, ARF1 and ARF3 (103190), from a
human cerebellum library. Based on deduced amino acid sequences and
patterns of hybridization of cDNA and oligonucleotide probes with
mammalian brain poly(A)+ RNA, human ARF1 is the homolog of bovine ARF1.
Human ARF3, however, appeared to represent a newly identified, third
type of ARF, which differs from bovine ARF1 and bovine ARF2. Peng et al.
(1989) also reported cloning of ADP-ribosylation factor.

Lee et al. (1992) found that human ARF1 is identical to its bovine
counterpart, has a distinctive pattern of tissue and developmental
expression, and is encoded by an mRNA of approximately 1.9 kb.

GENE FUNCTION

Coatomer, or COPI (see 601924), is a heptameric protein recruited to
membranes by ARF1. Coat assembly helps in the transport of budding off
membrane between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus.
Using fluorescence microscopy, Presley et al. (2002) showed that guanine
nucleotide exchange-activated ARF1 at the Golgi membrane recruits and
binds cytoplasmic COPI to the membranes. Photobleaching experiments
demonstrated that COPI remains at the membranes after ARF1-GTP has been
hydrolyzed by ARFGAP1 (608377). COPI binds to membrane cargo,
soluble-cargo receptors, or other Golgi proteins. Uncoating, or the
release of COPI from Golgi membranes to the cytoplasm, then occurs,
which can be inhibited by aluminum fluoride. Presley et al. (2002)
concluded from their kinetic and biochemical analyses that COPI and ARF1
continuously bind and release from Golgi membranes, allowing the
membrane at these sites to recruit cargo, alter their phospholipid
composition, and become larger, phase-separated domains.

Endocytosis of glycosylphosphatidyl inositol (GPI)-anchored proteins and
the fluid phase takes place primarily through a dynamin (see DNM1;
602377)- and clathrin (see CLTC; 118955)-independent, CDC42
(116952)-regulated pinocytic mechanism. In Chinese hamster ovary cells,
Kumari and Mayor (2008) found that reduced activity or levels of Arf1
inhibited GPI-anchored protein and fluid-phase endocytosis without
affecting other clathrin-dependent or -independent endocytic pathways.
Arf1 was activated at distinct sites on the plasma membrane, and it
recruited the CDC42 GTPase-activating protein Arhgap10 (609746) to the
plasma membrane, thereby modulating cell surface Cdc42 dynamics. Kumari
and Mayor (2008) concluded that ARF1 regulates both endocytosis and
secretion and may provide a mechanism for crosstalk between these
processes.

Using a yeast genetic screen for substrates of the Shigella flexneri
type III effector protein IpaJ, Burnaevskiy et al. (2013) identified
Arf1 and Arf2 (ARF4; 601177). Mass spectrometric analysis showed that
IpaJ cleaved the peptide bond between myristoylated gly2 and asn3 of
human ARF1. Further analysis showed that IpaJ cleaved numerous
N-myristoylated proteins with various functions. Burnaevskiy et al.
(2013) concluded that IpaJ is a cysteine protease that cleaves the
N-myrisoylated glycine from ARF1, possibly as the substrate cycles
between activity-dependent conformational states. They proposed that
cleavage of lipidated proteins may be a mechanism of microbial
pathogenesis.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Amor et al. (1994) described the 3-dimensional structure of full-length
human ARF1 in its GDP-bound nonmyristoylated form.

Mossessova et al. (1998) reported the crystal structure of the catalytic
Sec7 homology domain of ARNO (602488), a human guanine nucleotide
exchange factor (GEF) for ARF1, determined at 2.2-angstrom resolution.
The Sec7 domain is an elongated, all-helical protein with a distinctive
hydrophobic groove that is phylogenetically conserved. Structure-based
mutagenesis identifies the groove and an adjacent conserved loop as the
ARF-interacting surface. The sites of Sec7 domain interaction on ARF1
have subsequently been mapped, by protein footprinting experiments, to
the switch 1 and switch 2 GTPase regions, leading to a model for the
interaction between ARF GTPases and Sec7 domain exchange factors.

Nucleotide dissociation from small G protein-GEF complexes involves
transient GDP-bound intermediates. In the case of ARF proteins, small G
proteins that regulate membrane traffic in eukaryotic cells, such
intermediates can be trapped either by the natural inhibitor brefeldin A
or by charge reversal at the catalytic glutamate of the Sec7 domain of
their GEFs. Renault et al. (2003) reported the crystal structure of
these intermediates, which shows that membrane recruitment of ARF and
nucleotide dissociation are separate reactions stimulated by the Sec7
domain. The reactions proceed through sequential rotations of the
Arf-GDP core towards the Sec7 catalytic site, and are blocked by
interfacial binding of brefeldin A and unproductive stabilization of GDP
by charge reversal.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lee et al. (1992) determined that the ARF1 gene has 4 introns and spans
approximately 16.5 kb. Exon 1 (46 bp) contains only untranslated
sequence. The 5-prime flanking region has a high GC content but no TATA
or CAAT box, as found in housekeeping genes. The authors stated that the
2 human class I ARF genes, ARF1 and ARF3, have similar exon/intron
organizations and use GC-rich promoters.

MAPPING

Hirai et al. (1996) obtained an expressed sequence tag related to the
ARF1 gene and used fluorescence in situ hybridization to assign ARF1 to
1q42.

603515	TITLE *603515 CHORIONIC SOMATOMAMMOTROPIN HORMONE-LIKE 1; CSHL1
;;CHORIONIC SOMATOMAMMOTROPIN-LIKE; CSL
DESCRIPTION The human growth hormone/human chorionic somatomammotropin (GH/CS) gene
cluster contains 5 genes, including chorionic somatomammotropin-like
(CSL). See CSH1 (CSA; 150200).

Chen et al. (1989) recovered CSL cDNAs from a placenta library. They
noted that CSL cDNAs were present at a relatively low level in the
library compared to CSA and CSB (118820) cDNAs. The CSL gene has a
single nucleotide substitution (relative to the other 4 genes in the
cluster) in a splice donor site that results in a different mRNA
splicing pattern and, hence, in a novel sequence of the predicted CSL
protein. Chen et al. (1989) proposed that the CSL protein may be
evolving into a distinct hormone. Using RT-PCR, MacLeod et al. (1992)
found 2 alternatively spliced CSL transcripts in the placental villi.
However, they found no evidence that either of these transcripts is
translated or functional.

Misra-Press et al. (1994) found that CSL is actively transcribed in the
placenta and exhibits a complex pattern of alternative splicing. The
majority of the CSL transcripts encode predicted nonfunctional proteins.
However, a subpopulation of mRNAs retain the potential for synthesis of
a functional, secreted, gestational hormone. These authors noted that
Goossens et al. (1986) (see 139250) and Wurzel et al. (1982) (see CSA)
described normally developed infants who lacked the other 3 placentally
expressed genes of the GH/CS cluster but who had an intact CSL gene.
Misra-Press et al. (1994) stated that these studies suggest that CSL
might compensate for absence of the other members of the GH/CS cluster
during human gestation.

By in situ hybridization, Harper et al. (1982) mapped the GH gene
cluster to 17q22-q24.

;;PROTEOGLYCAN II;;
PG II;;
PG40
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Decorin and biglycan (301870) are related but distinct small
proteoglycans found in many connective tissues. Using Northern blot
analysis or RT-PCR, Danielson et al. (1993) detected the 2 alternatively
spliced leader exons of the DCN gene in a variety of mRNAs isolated from
human cell lines and tissues. Sequences highly homologous (74-87%) to
exons Ia and Ib were found in the 5-prime untranslated region of avian
and bovine decorin, respectively. This high degree of conservation among
species suggested regulatory functions for these leader exons. In situ
hybridization studies of developing mouse embryos suggested that decorin
may play a role in epithelial/mesenchymal interactions during organ
development and shaping (Scholzen et al., 1994).

GENE STRUCTURE

Danielson et al. (1993) found that the human decorin gene spans more
than 38 kb and contains 8 exons and very large introns, 2 of which are
5.4 and more than 13.2 kb. They discovered 2 alternatively spliced
leader exons, Ia and Ib, in the 5-prime untranslated region.

MAPPING

By Southern analysis of a panel of human-rodent somatic cell hybrid DNAs
with cDNA probes, McBride et al. (1990) assigned the DCN gene to
chromosome 12. Regionalization to 12p12.1-qter was obtained by examining
hybrids containing spontaneous breaks or well-characterized
translocations involving chromosome 12. Hybridization with subfragment
cDNA probes suggested the presence of 2 copies of the DCN gene, or
related sequences, at the locus on chromosome 12, although there was no
evidence for the function of more than one DCN gene. By in situ
hybridization, Pulkkinen et al. (1992) placed the DCN gene at 12q21-q22.
Vetter et al., (1993) mapped the human decorin gene by in situ
hybridization to 12q21.3. Using a genomic clone as the labeled probe and
in situ hybridization, Danielson et al. (1993) mapped the DCN gene to
12q23. They specifically noted that there were 4 times as many grains
centered on 12q23 as on 12q21, where Pulkkinen et al. (1992) had placed
the probable site. In a study of candidate genes for Noonan syndrome
(163950), Ion et al. (2000) reassigned the map position of DCN to
12q13.2 using FISH. Scholzen et al. (1994) assigned the homologous gene
in the mouse to chromosome 10, using interspecific backcrossing.

GENE FUNCTION

Vogel and Clark (1989) found little evidence that the metabolism of
either decorin or biglycan is altered by abnormalities in the structure
or secretion of types I and III collagen. In a presumably homozygous
case of the Marfan syndrome (154700) reported by Schollin et al. (1988),
Pulkkinen et al. (1990) found markedly decreased level of mRNA for
decorin, markedly decreased decorin polypeptide in the culture medium of
fibroblasts from the infant, and deficient effect of interleukin-1-beta
(147720) on the transcription of decorin as tested in these fibroblasts.
In 3 of 12 other unrelated Marfan patients, they also found deficient
decorin expression.

Dyne et al. (1996) studied 2 patients with osteogenesis imperfecta and
the same gly415-to-ser mutation of the COL1A1 gene (120150.0044), but a
different clinical expression. They speculated that these differences
could be the result of abnormalities in other connective tissue
proteins. Since decorin is a component of connective tissue, binds to
type I collagen fibrils, and plays a role in matrix assembly, they
studied decorin production in skin fibroblasts from these 2 patients.
Cultured fibroblasts from the patient with extremely severe osteogenesis
imperfecta (classified as type II/III) were found to secrete barely
detectable amounts of decorin into culture medium. Northern blot
analysis showed decorin mRNA levels below the limit of detection. The
patient with a less severe phenotype had fibroblasts that expressed
decorin normally. Dyne et al. (1996) suggested that the different
clinical phenotypes could be due to the differing genetic backgrounds of
the patients, such that in the more severely affected patient the
absence of decorin aggravated the clinical phenotype.

When expressed ectopically, decorin is capable of suppressing the growth
of various tumor cell lines. Moscatello et al. (1998) demonstrated that
it induced a marked growth suppression in A431 squamous carcinoma cells,
when either exogenously added or endogenously produced by a transgene.
Decorin caused rapid phosphorylation of the EGF receptor (131550) and a
concurrent activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase signal
pathway. Thus, EGF and decorin converge functionally to regulate the
cell cycle through activation of a common pathway that ultimately leads
to growth suppression.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a family with congenital stromal corneal dystrophy (CSCD; 610048),
Bredrup et al. (2005) identified a heterozygous 1-bp deletion in the
last exon, which they erroneously labeled exon 10 (Rodahl, 2009), of the
DCN gene (125255.0001). The deletion was found in all affected family
members but not in any healthy family member or in 200 normal controls.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001

DCN, 1-BP DEL, 967T

In a Norwegian family originally reported by Odland (1968) with
congenital stromal corneal dystrophy (CSCD; 610048), Bredrup et al.
(2005) identified a heterozygous 1-bp deletion (967delT) in the last
exon, which they erroneously labeled exon 10 (Rodahl, 2009), of the DCN
gene. The mutation was predicted to lead to a frameshift, alteration of
4 amino acids, and loss of the C-terminal 33 amino acids (S323fsX5).
Bredrup et al. (2005) postulated that the defective interaction of
mutant decorin with collagen would disturb the regularity of corneal
collagen in affected heterozygotes.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The GTF2IRD1 gene was identified within the chromosomal region on
7q11.23 commonly deleted in Williams syndrome (194050) and is involved
in mammalian craniofacial and cognitive development (Tassabehji et al.,
2005).

CLONING

Tassabehji et al. (1999) isolated and characterized a 3.4-kb gene, which
they called general transcription factor III (GTF3), which occupies
about 140 kb of the region deleted in Williams syndrome. Northern blot
analysis showed that the gene is expressed in skeletal muscle and heart,
and RT-PCR analysis showed expression in a range of adult tissues with
stronger expression in fetal tissues. Part of the conceptual GTF3
protein sequence was found to be almost identical to a slow muscle-fiber
enhancer binding protein identified by O'Mahoney et al. (1998) and
termed MusTRD1. GTF3 showed significant homology to the 90-amino acid
putative helix-loop-helix repeat (HLH) domains of the transcription
factor TFII-I (GTF2I; 601679), which maps distal to GTF4 within the
Williams syndrome deleted region.

Osborne et al. (1999) identified the same gene, which they termed
WBSCR11, by genomic DNA sequence analysis and screening of 2 colon
carcinoma cell line cDNA libraries. The cDNA sequence predicts an
895-amino acid protein.

Franke et al. (1999) cloned GTF2IRD1 from cDNA libraries representing
several diverse tissues, and they obtained a full-length cDNA by 5-prime
RACE of an adult brain cDNA library. They also identified several splice
variants arising from exon skipping. The longest deduced protein
contains 944 amino acids. In addition to the repeated GTF2I motifs and
HLH repeats, Franke et al. (1999) identified a myc (190080)-type HLH
dimerization domain, a number of putative phosphorylation sites and
N-myristoylation sites, an amidation site, and several putative nuclear
localization signals. Northern blot analysis detected expression of
GTF2IRD1 in all adult and fetal tissues except leukocytes. The dominant
transcript was 3.6 kb long, with sizes ranging from 1.5 kb to 5.0 kb.

By Western blot analysis, Yan et al. (2000) found that endogenous
GTF2IRD1, which they designated CREAM1, was expressed at low levels as a
120-kD protein in a variety of human cell lines and tissues. GTF2IRD1
was expressed in the nucleus of transfected cells, and deletion of the
C-terminal nuclear localization signal resulted in cytoplasmic
expression.

Bayarsaihan and Ruddle (2000) cloned mouse Gtf2ird1, which they
designated Ben. The deduced full-length 1,072-amino acid protein
contains an N-terminal leucine zipper motif, followed by 6
helix-loop-helix domains, a nuclear localization signal, and a
C-terminal serine-rich region. Northern blot analysis detected several
Ben transcripts in all mouse tissues examined. Western blot analysis
showed several Ben isoforms with apparent molecular masses of 40 to 165
kD.

GENE STRUCTURE

Osborne et al. (1999) determined that the WBSCR11 gene spans 95 kb of
genomic DNA and consists of 26 exons, not including the last noncoding
exon.

Franke et al. (1999) determined that the GTF2IRD1 gene contains up to 30
exons and spans about 105 kb. The coding sequence uses 26 exons.

Palmer et al. (2010) determined that the region upstream of the GTF2IRD1
gene contains a well-conserved CCAAT box and 3 canonical
GTF2IRD1-recognition sequences (GGATTA), one of which is inverted.

MAPPING

Franke et al. (1999) reported that the GF2IRD1 gene maps within the WBS
deletion region on chromosome 7q11.23 and is oriented 5-prime to 3-prime
in the centromeric to telomeric orientation.

Tassabehji et al. (1999) tabulated 11 genes in addition to GTF3 that had
been mapped to the deleted area of chromosome 7 in classic Williams
syndrome.

Lazebnik et al. (2008) stated that the mouse Gtf2ird1 gene maps to a
region of chromosome 5 that shares homology of synteny with human
chromosome 7.

GENE FUNCTION

Yan et al. (2000) determined that GTF2IRD1 interacted with the RB1
protein (614041) in vitro and in vivo. They also showed that full length
GTF2IRD1 stimulated transcription of a reporter gene and, by mutation
analysis, they localized the activation domain to the N terminus.

Using yeast 1-hybrid analysis, Bayarsaihan and Ruddle (2000) showed that
in vitro-translated mouse Ben interacted with an early enhancer upstream
of the Hoxc8 (142970) transcription start site.

Ring et al. (2002) characterized the Xenopus homolog of GTF2IRD1,
Xwbscr11. They determined that Xwbscr11 binds DNA via selective HLH
repeats and interacts with the transcription factor FOXH1 (603621) and
the signal transduction molecules Smad2 (601366) and Smad3 (603109) to
affect activin (147290)/nodal-mediated induction of the distal element
of the Xenopus goosecoid promoter.

Vullhorst and Buonanno (2003) characterized mouse Gtf3 splice variants.
They determined that HLH domain 4 is necessary and sufficient for
binding the bicoid-like motif of the troponin (191042) enhancer. An
isoform that lacks exon 23 and exons 26 through 28 interacted most
avidly with the bicoid-like motif. Isoforms that included these exons
failed to bind in gel retardation assays. The authors also determined
that Gtf3 polypeptides associate with each other via the leucine zipper.

Lazebnik et al. (2008) showed that BEN bound the 8-bp core consensus
sequence CAG(C/G)G(C/A)GA, surrounded by G- and C-rich sequences. BEN
repressed expression of a reporter gene containing 3 copies of the
sequence 5-prime-GGGGGCAGCGACAGCCCCC-3-prime. Knockdown of Ben
expression in C2C12 mouse myoblasts enhanced expression of Bmpr1b
(603248), Sox4 (184430), En1 (131290), and Fgf15, the mouse ortholog of
FGF19 (603891). Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis followed by
quantitative PCR confirmed binding of BEN to Fgf15.

Palmer et al. (2010) found that GTF2IRD1 is subject to negative
autoregulation. All isoforms of mouse or human GTF2IRD1 bound 3
canonical GTF2IRD1-binding sites (GGATTA) in the region upstream of the
GTF2IRD1 gene. EMSA using artificial DNA probes and in vitro-translated
GTF2IRD1 revealed enhanced binding in the presence of 3 GGATTA sites and
dimerization of GTF2IRD1 proteins via an N-terminal leucine zipper
region. Binding by GTF2IRD1 repressed expression of a reporter gene.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Tassabehji et al. (1999) found that GTF3 was deleted in patients with
classic Williams syndrome, but not in patients with partial deletions
who had only supravalvular aortic stenosis. They suggested that
haploinsufficiency of the GTF3 gene may be the cause of the abnormal
muscle fatigability that is characteristic of Williams syndrome.

Tassabehji et al. (2005) reported a rare WBS individual with an atypical
deletion, including the GTF2IRD1 gene, showed facial dysmorphism and
cognitive deficits that differed from those of classic WBS cases. They
proposed a mechanism of cumulative dosage effects of duplicated and
diverged genes applicable to other human chromosomal disorders.

ANIMAL MODEL

Tassabehji et al. (2005) demonstrated that GTF2IRD1 is involved in
mammalian craniofacial and cognitive development. Gtf2ird1-null mice
exhibited phenotypic abnormalities reminiscent of the human
microdeletion disorder Williams-Beuren syndrome; craniofacial imaging
revealed abnormalities in both skull and jaws that may arise through
misregulation of goosecoid (138890), a downstream target of Gtf2ird1.

Palmer et al. (2010) found that mutant mice lacking Gtf2ird1 exon 2
expressed a mutant Gtf2ird1 transcript. The mutant transcript was
expressed at wildtype levels due to escape from nonsense mediated decay
and escape from negative autoregulation by Gtf2ird1 itself.

102750	TITLE *102750 ADENOSINE KINASE; ADK
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The ADK gene encodes adenosine kinase (ATP:adenosine
5-prime-phosphotransferase; EC 2.7.1.20), an abundant enzyme in
mammalian tissues that catalyzes the transfer of the gamma-phosphate
from ATP to adenosine, thereby serving as a potentially important
regulator of concentrations of both extracellular adenosine and
intracellular adenine nucleotides. Adenosine has widespread effects on
the cardiovascular, nervous, respiratory, and immune systems, and
inhibitors of ADK could play an important pharmacologic role in
increasing intravascular adenosine concentrations and acting as
inflammatory agents (summary by Spychala et al., 1996).

CLONING

Spychala et al. (1996) obtained full-length cDNA clones encoding
catalytically active ADK from lymphocyte, placental, and liver cDNA
libraries. On Northern blots of all tissues examined, they identified
mRNA species of 1.3 and 1.8 kb, attributable to alternative
polyadenylation sites at the 3-prime end of the gene. The encoded
protein consisted of 345 amino acids with a calculated molecular size of
38.7 kD and without any sequence similarities to other
well-characterized mammalian nucleoside kinases. In contrast, 2 regions
were identified with significant sequence identity to microbial
ribokinase and fructokinases and a bacterial inosine/guanosine kinase.
Thus, ADK is a structurally distinct mammalian nucleoside kinase that
appears to be akin to sugar kinases of microbial origin.

McNally et al. (1997) also cloned human cDNAs encoding adenosine kinase.
They found cDNAs encoding both the 345-amino acid form and a 362-amino
acid form of the enzyme. These 2 alternately spliced forms differed only
at the 5-prime end. When expressed, both isoforms of the enzyme
phosphorylated adenosine with identical kinetics and both required Mg2+
for activity.

MAPPING

The structural gene for this enzyme was tentatively assigned to
chromosome 10 by somatic cell hybrid studies (Klobutcher et al., 1976).
By the principle of gene dosage, Francke and Thompson (1979) concluded
by exclusion that ADK must be in the region 10q11-10q24.

In a case of trisomy 10p, Snyder et al. (1984) found normal levels of
ADK.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

By exome sequencing, Bjursell et al. (2011) identified a homozygous
mutation in the ADK gene (102750.0001) in 2 Swedish sibs with severe
developmental delay, mild liver dysfunction, and persistent
hypermethioninemia due to adenosine kinase deficiency (614300).
Subsequent analysis of this gene in Malaysian patients with a similar
phenotype revealed 2 different homozygous mutations in the ADK gene
(102750.0002 and 102750.0003) in 2 families. The phenotype was
characterized by global developmental delay, early-onset seizures, mild
dysmorphic features, and characteristic biochemical anomalies, including
persistent hypermethioninemia with increased levels of
S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) and S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy);
homocysteine was typically normal. Bjursell et al. (2011) concluded that
the phenotype resulted from a combination of direct adenosine toxicity,
a defect in the regulation of adenosine, and disruption of a wide range
of methyltransferase reactions.

ANIMAL MODEL

Neonatal hepatic steatosis (228100) is a fatal condition characterized
by rapid microvesicular fat infiltration and enlargement of the liver,
which shows a pale and yellowish coloration. Microvesicular fat
infiltration, liver failure, coma, and death are considered to be a
consequence of severe impairment of mitochondrial function. Boison et
al. (2002) pursued the hypothesis that a deficit in adenosine-dependent
metabolism is a causative factor for the development of microvesicular
hepatic steatosis. A deficiency of adenosine kinase, the major
adenosine-removing enzyme of postnatal liver, was expected to affect
liver function on 3 levels: availability of adenine nucleotides;
disruption of the futile cycle between AMP and adenosine; and
maintenance of transmethylation reactions. Homozygous Adk -/- mice,
generated through Adk targeting of embryonic stem cells, developed
normally during embryogenesis. However, within 4 days after birth they
displayed microvesicular hepatic steatosis and died within 14 days with
fatty liver. Adenine nucleotides were decreased and
S-adenosylhomocysteine, a potent inhibitor of transmethylation
reactions, was increased in the mutant liver. Thus, a deficiency of
adenosine metabolism is identified as a powerful contributor to the
development of neonatal hepatic steatosis, providing a model for the
rapid development of postnatally lethal fatty liver.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HYPERMETHIONINEMIA DUE TO ADENOSINE KINASE DEFICIENCY
ADK, ALA301GLU

In 2 Swedish sibs with hypermethioninemia due to adenosine kinase
deficiency (614300), Bjursell et al. (2011) identified a homozygous
902C-A transversion in the ADK gene, resulting in an ala301-to-glu
(A301E) substitution adjacent to the catalytic site. Each unaffected
parent was heterozygous for the mutation, which was not found in 105
controls. In vitro functional expression studies in E. coli showed that
the mutant protein had almost no enzymatic activity.

HYPERMETHIONINEMIA DUE TO ADENOSINE KINASE DEFICIENCY
ADK, ASP218ALA

In 2 Malaysian sibs with hypermethioninemia due to adenosine kinase
deficiency (614300), Bjursell et al. (2011) identified a homozygous
653A-C transversion in the ADK gene, resulting in an asp218-to-ala
(D218A) substitution in the central beta-sheet domain. Each unaffected
parent was heterozygous for the mutation. In vitro functional expression
studies in E. coli showed that the mutant protein had about 20% residual
enzymatic activity compared to wildtype.

HYPERMETHIONINEMIA DUE TO ADENOSINE KINASE DEFICIENCY
ADK, GLY13GLU

In 2 Malaysian sibs with hypermethioninemia due to adenosine kinase
deficiency (614300), Bjursell et al. (2011) identified a homozygous
38G-A transition in the ADK gene, resulting in a gly13-to-glu (G13E)
substitution close to the binding site for adenosine. Each unaffected
parent was heterozygous for the mutation. In vitro functional expression
studies in E. coli showed that the mutant protein had about 10% residual
enzymatic activity compared to wildtype.
