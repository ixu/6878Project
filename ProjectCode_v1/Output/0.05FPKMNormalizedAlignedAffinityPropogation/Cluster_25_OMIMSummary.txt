;;GRANULOCYTE-MACROPHAGE COLONY-STIMULATING FACTOR RECEPTOR, LOW AFFINITY,
ALPHA SUBUNIT; GMCSFR
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GMCSF, or CSF2;
138960) activates STAT5 (601511) and other signaling pathways via
binding to a cell surface receptor composed of a ligand-binding alpha
subunit, encoded by CSF2RA, and a nonbinding affinity-enhancing beta
subunit, encoded by CSF2RB (138981) (Suzuki et al., 2008).

CLONING

Using an expression cloning strategy, Gearing et al. (1989) isolated a
cDNA encoding CSF2RA, which they called GMCSFR, from a human placenta
cDNA library. The deduced 400-amino acid precursor protein has a
22-amino acid signal peptide. The 378-amino acid mature protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 43.7 kD and contains a single transmembrane
domain, a glycosylated extracellular domain, and a short
intracytoplasmic tail. Northern blot analysis detected GMCSFR expression
in a variety of hemopoietic cells displaying GMCSF binding.

Raines et al. (1991) identified a truncated, soluble form of the
low-affinity GMCSF receptor in choriocarcinoma cells. Clones encoding
the soluble receptor were identical in sequence to the membrane-bound
form except for a 97-nucleotide deletion. The amino acid sequence of
this deleted cDNA predicted a protein that lacks the 84 C-terminal amino
acids of the membrane-bound receptor, including the transmembrane and
cytoplasmic domains, and contains 16 different amino acids at its C
terminus. RNase protection analysis indicated that this variant cDNA was
derived from a naturally occurring mRNA. Soluble receptors had been
identified for several other hematopoietin receptors and may be a
general feature of this class. It is likely that alternative mRNA
splicing is the mechanism by which the soluble counterparts are
generated.

GENE STRUCTURE

Rappold et al. (1992) found that the CSF2RA gene spans at least 45 kb.

MAPPING

By Southern blot analysis of a panel of mouse-human somatic cell
hybrids, Gough et al. (1990) demonstrated that the CSF2R gene is on the
X chromosome. The possibility that an allele also maps to the Y
chromosome was suggested by the observation that many DNA samples from
normal males carry 2 alleles of this gene. Among 65 normal persons, 23
females and 20 males were homozygous for an allele of fragment A,
whereas 8 females and 14 males were heterozygous. By in situ
hybridization, Gough et al. (1990) showed that the CSF2R gene maps to
the tip of the short arm of the X chromosome and the short arm of the Y
chromosome (see 425000), with the most likely localization being
Xpter-p21 and Ypter-p11.2. Although this information was consistent with
its location in the pseudoautosomal region (PAR), conclusive proof
required study of segregation of the locus with respect to sexual
phenotype. They found in a total of 14 informative male meioses, 3
recombination events; i.e., in 2 cases a daughter had inherited the
allele from the paternal Y chromosome, and in 1 instance a son had
inherited the allele from the paternal X chromosome. Thus, the CSF2R
locus is distal to the MIC2 locus (313470), which shows only about 2.5%
recombination and maps close to the PAR boundary. This was the first
localization of a gene of known function to this region, which
encompasses about 2,500 kb.

By pulsed field gel electrophoresis, Rappold et al. (1992) localized the
CSF2RA gene 1,180 to 1,300 kb from the telomere, in close proximity to
the CpG island B5. The gene showed abundant hypervariable sequences, and
a number of informative restriction fragment length polymorphisms were
defined. Rappold et al. (1992) suggested that these polymorphisms might
be useful in proving the pseudoautosomal inheritance of apparently
autosomal traits, as has been suggested for schizophrenia (Crow, 1988),
cerebral dominance (Crow, 1989), and Kabuki make-up syndrome (Niikawa et
al., 1988; 147920), among others.

Rappold (1993) discussed in detail the pseudoautosomal regions that
exist at the tips of the short and long arms of the X and Y chromosomes
and cover 2.6 and 0.4 Mb, respectively.

By both in situ hybridization and linkage analysis, Disteche et al.
(1992) found that the murine Csf2ra gene maps to chromosome 19.

GENE FUNCTION

DiPersio et al. (1988) studied the binding of GMCSF, over a wide range
of concentrations, to normal human peripheral blood cells, bone marrow,
acute and chronic myeloid leukemia cells, and a number of established
human myeloid and nonmyeloid cell lines; thereby, they defined the
receptors.

Gearing et al. (1989) found that transfection of GMCSFR cDNA into COS
cells directed expression of a GMCSF receptor showing a single class of
affinity and specificity for human GMCSF, but not interleukin-3 (IL3;
147740).

Hayashida et al. (1990) showed that the high-affinity GMCSF receptor is
composed of at least 2 components in a manner analogous to the IL2
receptor (see 147730). They proposed to designate the low-affinity GMCSF
receptor as the alpha subunit, and the 'new' protein that they
identified and called KH97 as the beta subunit (see 138981). The 2
subunits are approximately 80 and 120 kD, respectively.

Raines et al. (1991) found that expression of the variant cDNA encoding
the truncated, soluble CSF2R isoform produced a secreted protein that
retained its capacity to bind CSF2 in solution.

Kondo et al. (2000) showed that a clonogenic common lymphoid progenitor,
a bone marrow-resident cell that gives rise exclusively to lymphocytes
(T, B, and natural killer cells), can be redirected to the myeloid
lineage by stimulation through exogenously expressed interleukin-2
receptor (146710) and GMCSF receptor. Analysis of mutants of the
beta-chain of the IL2 receptor revealed that the granulocyte and
monocyte differentiation signals are triggered by different cytoplasmic
domains, showing that the signaling pathways responsible for these
unique developmental outcomes are separable. Finally, Kondo et al.
(2000) showed that the endogenous myelomonocytic cytokine receptors for
GMCSF and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (CSF1R; 164770) are
expressed at low to moderate levels on the more primitive hematopoietic
stem cells, are absent on common lymphoid progenitors, and are
upregulated after myeloid lineage induction by IL2 (147680). Kondo et
al. (2000) concluded that cytokine signaling can regulate cell fate
decisions and proposed that a critical step in lymphoid commitment is
downregulation of cytokine receptors that drive myeloid cell
development.

Loss of either the X or the Y chromosome is apparent in 25% of acute
myeloid leukemias of the M2 subtype (AML-M2), compared with only 1 to 6%
in other AML subtypes, suggesting the involvement of a 'recessive
oncogene' in the genesis of M2 AMLs. The presumed gene is likely to be
in the PAR, because if it were located in the portion of the X
chromosome not shared with the Y, then similar loss of the Y chromosome
would not be predicted, and vice versa. Gough et al. (1990) suggested
that CSF2R may be the gene in question. Loss or inactivation of both
copies of the gene in a myeloid progenitor cell would be expected to
result in a clone of cells unable to respond to GMCSF, and hence in the
relatively undifferentiated phenotype of the M2 form of leukemia.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a rare lung disorder in which
surfactant-derived lipoproteins accumulate excessively within pulmonary
alveoli, causing severe respiratory distress. It is a disorder of
surfactant metabolism. The importance of CSF2 in the pathogenesis of PAP
has been confirmed in humans and mice, wherein CSF2 signaling is
required for pulmonary alveolar macrophage catabolism of surfactant.
Using flow cytometry, Martinez-Moczygemba et al. (2008) found that
CSF2RA was absent on monocytes from a 4-year-old girl with PAP due to
pulmonary surfactant metabolism dysfunction (SMDP4; 300770). The
patient's mother expressed CSF2RA on all monocytes, whereas the
patient's father and sister expressed CSF2RA only on a subpopulation of
monocytes. Stimulation of granulocytes with CSF2 induced upregulation of
CD11B (ITGAM; 120980) in the mother, but not the patient. Karyotypic
analysis showed that the patient had 1 X chromosome of apparently normal
length and 1 X chromosome with a truncated Xp arm that did not hybridize
with a PAR1 probe. RT-PCR analysis detected expression of CSF2RA in
leukocytes from the patient's family members, but not in those from the
patient. PCR analysis of the 11 coding exons of the CSF2RA gene revealed
a deletion of exons 5 through 13 (306250.0001) in the patient's DNA,
providing a genetic basis for the absence of CSF2RA mRNA and protein.

Using flow cytometry, Suzuki et al. (2008) found that both CSF2RA and
CSF2RB were present on leukocytes from 2 sisters with PAP, as well as
all family members tested. However, Western blot analysis showed that
the affected sisters expressed only a truncated form of CSF2RA, whereas
their father was heterozygous for the normal and truncated forms, and
their mother expressed only normal CSF2RA. CSF2 binding and
CSF2-dependent signaling were severely reduced, but not abolished, in
the sisters, and their CD11B stimulation test was abnormal. Suzuki et
al. (2008) identified a mutation in the CSF2RA gene in the affected
sisters that resulted in a gly174-to-arg (G174R; 306250.0002)
substitution. The father was heterozygous for the G174R mutation, but
the mother had only wildtype CSF2RA. PCR analysis showed that CSF2RA
copy number was reduced in the sisters and their mother, but not in the
father. FISH analysis demonstrated a 1.6-Mb deletion of PAR1, including
the CSF2RA gene, in 1 X chromosome of the sisters and mother. Suzuki et
al. (2008) concluded that PAP may be caused by compound heterozygous
abnormalities affecting the CSF2RA gene, and that CSF2 signaling is
critical for surfactant homeostasis in humans.

ANIMAL MODEL

Schweizerhof et al. (2009) presented evidence that GCSF (CSF3; 138970)
and GMCSF mediate bone cancer pain and tumor-nerve interactions.
Increased levels of both factors were detected in bone marrow lysates
and adjoining connective tissue in a mouse sarcoma model of bone
tumor-induced pain compared to controls. The functional receptors GCSFR
(CSF3R; 138971) and GMCSFR were expressed on peripheral nerves in the
bone matrix and in dorsal root ganglia. GMCSF sensitized nerves to
mechanical stimuli in vitro and in vivo, potentiated CGRP (114130)
release, and caused sprouting of sensory nerve endings in the skin. RNA
interference of GCSF and GMCSF signaling in the mouse sarcoma model led
to reduced tumor growth and nerve remodeling, and abrogated bone cancer
pain.

CSF2RA, EX5-13 DEL

In a 4-year-old girl with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (300770),
Martinez-Moczygemba et al. (2008) identified a deletion of exons 5
through 13 in the CSF2RA gene. Karyotypic analysis showed that the
patient's other X chromosome had a truncated Xp arm that did not
hybridize with a probe for pseudoautosomal region-1, which contains
CSF2RA. The patient's mother expressed CSF2RA on all monocytes, whereas
the patient's father and sister expressed CSF2RA only on a subpopulation
of monocytes. Stimulation of granulocytes with CSF2 (1389060) induced
upregulation of CD11B (ITGAM; 120980) in the mother, but not the
patient. RT-PCR analysis detected expression of CSF2RA in leukocytes
from the patient's family members, but not in those from the patient.

CSF2RA, GLY174ARG

Suzuki et al. (2008) identified a G-to-A transition in exon 7 of the
CSF2RA gene in genomic DNA from 2 sisters with pulmonary alveolar
proteinosis (300770), one 6 years of age and the other 8 years of age.
The mutation resulted in a gly174-to-arg (G174R) substitution that
altered 1 of 11 potential N-glycosylation sites in the CSF2RA protein.
Western blot analysis showed that the affected sisters expressed only a
truncated form of CSF2RA, whereas their father was heterozygous for the
normal and truncated forms, and their mother expressed only normal
CSF2RA. CSF2 (138960) binding and CSF2-dependent signaling were severely
reduced, but not abolished, in the sisters, and their CD11B (120980)
stimulation test was abnormal. The father was heterozygous for the G174R
mutation, but the mother had only wildtype CSF2RA. PCR analysis showed
that CSF2RA copy number was reduced in the sisters and their mother, but
not in the father. FISH analysis demonstrated a 1.6-Mb deletion of
pseudoautosomal region-1, including the CSF2RA gene, in 1 X chromosome
of the sisters and mother. Transfection of CSF2RA with the G174R
mutation into 293 cells reproduced the CSF2 signaling defect at
physiologic CSF2 concentrations. At high CSF2 concentrations, similar to
those observed in the index patient, signaling was partially rescued,
thereby providing a molecular explanation for the slow disease
progression in the 2 sisters.

;;INHIBITOR OF APOPTOSIS PROTEIN, MELANOMA; MLIAP;;
INHIBITOR OF APOPTOSIS PROTEIN, KIDNEY; KIAP;;
LIVIN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) contain conserved, unique
N-terminal baculovirus IAP repeats (BIRs) and usually a C-terminal RING
finger domain. The BIR domain is essential for inhibitory activity and
typically interacts with cysteine-containing aspartate-specific
proteases (caspases, e.g., CASP3; 600636) or with APAF1 (602233), which
together with cytochrome C (123970) mediates activation of CASP9
(602234). The RING finger domain sometimes enhances antiapoptotic
activity but does not inhibit apoptosis alone.

CLONING

By searching a sequence database for BIR-containing sequences, Vucic et
al. (2000) identified cDNAs encoding BIRC7, which they termed MLIAP. The
deduced 280- and 298-amino acid BIRC7 proteins each contain a single BIR
domain and a RING finger motif. The BIR domain is most similar to the
second and third BIRs of BIRC2 (601712), BIRC3 (601721), and BIRC4
(XIAP; 300079). Northern blot analysis revealed highest expression of
1.5- and 2.2-kb transcripts in melanomas, with lower expression in some
lymphomas, fetal kidney, fetal liver, testis, and thymus; expression was
not detected in normal melanocytes. Confocal microscopy showed
localization predominantly to the cytoplasm and, unlike that of survivin
(BIRC5; 603352), not to mitotic spindles.

Lin et al. (2000) also cloned BIRC7, which they called KIAP, by
searching an EST database and using 5-prime and 3-prime RACE on a fetal
kidney cDNA library. Like apollon (BIRC6; 605638) and survivin, the
deduced 299-amino acid BIRC7 protein contains only 1 BIR motif with the
signature 3 cysteines and 1 histidine. Northern blot analysis detected
1.4-, 2.2-, and 4.0-kb transcripts in placenta, lymph node, and fetal
kidney; expression was not detected in other normal tissues tested.

Kasof and Gomes (2001) also cloned BIRC7, which they termed livin. The
deduced 280-amino acid protein lacks the coiled-coil domain found in
survivin but does have a RING finger. Northern blot analysis revealed
expression of 1.4-, 2.0-, and 2.8-kb transcripts in placenta and fetal
brain, as well as in melanomas and, to a lesser extent, in HeLa cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Functional analysis by Vucic et al. (2000) showed that expression of
BIRC7 blocked apoptosis induced by engagement of FAS (134637), tumor
necrosis factor receptor-1 (TNFR1; 191190), death receptor-4 (DR4;
603611), and DR5 (603612), as well as apoptosis induced by
chemotherapeutic agents, with a potency comparable to that observed with
BIRC2 and BIRC4. Further analysis indicated that MLIAP is active against
CASP3 and the cytochrome C pathway but not against CASP7 (601761).
Mutational analysis determined that the BIR domain is essential for
antiapoptotic activity.

Lin et al. (2000) showed that BIRC7 blocked apoptosis induced by BAX
(600040) induction of cytochrome C release from mitochondria. The
authors also found that BIRC7 blocked apoptosis induced by
chemotherapeutic agents, but in contrast to the findings of Vucic et al.
(2000), it did not block apoptosis induced by FAS.

Kasof and Gomes (2001) demonstrated that, through its BIR domain, livin
inhibited apoptosis mediated by DR6 and downstream adaptor proteins
within the TNF/FAS pathway. This inhibition could be reversed by an
antisense construct to livin. Immunoprecipitation and Western blot
analysis indicated livin binds to CASP3, CASP7, and CASP9, but it only
inhibits CASP9. In contrast to the findings of Vucic et al. (2000),
immunofluorescence microscopy detected overexpressed livin in the
nucleus and in a filamentous pattern in the cytoplasm, as observed with
survivin.

The identification of antigens associated with tumor destruction is a
major goal of cancer immunology. Vaccination with irradiated tumor cells
engineered to secrete granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor
(CSF2; 138960) generates potent, specific, and long-lasting antitumor
immunity through improved tumor antigen presentation by dendritic cells
and macrophages. A phase I clinical trial of this immunization strategy
in patients with disseminated melanoma revealed the consistent induction
in distant metastases of dense T- and B-cell infiltrates that
effectuated substantial tumor necrosis and fibrosis (Soiffer et al.,
1998). To delineate the target antigens of this vaccine-stimulated tumor
destruction, Schmollinger et al. (2003) screened a melanoma cDNA
expression library with postimmunization sera from a long-term
responding patient. High-titer IgG antibodies recognized MLIAP. Although
the patient harbored antibodies to this protein at the time of study
entry, multiple courses of vaccination over 4 years increased antibody
titers and elicited isotype switching. Moreover, lymphocyte infiltrates
in necrotic metastases included CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells specific for
MLIAP, as revealed by proliferation, tetramer, enzyme-linked immunospot,
and cytotoxicity analysis. Whereas melanoma cells in densely infiltrated
lesions showed strong MLIAP expression by immunohistochemistry, lethal
disease progression was associated with the loss of MLIAP staining and
the absence of lymphocyte infiltrates. These findings demonstrated that
MLIAP can serve as a target for immune-mediated tumor destruction, but
that antigen-loss variants can lead to immune escape.

Ye et al. (2013) found that microRNA-198 (MIR198; 605547) downregulated
livin expression in human prostate cancer cells by directly binding to
the livin 3-prime UTR.

MAPPING

Vucic et al. (2000) mapped the BIRC7 gene to 20q13, a region frequently
amplified in melanomas and other malignancies, using radiation hybrid
analysis. By FISH, Lin et al. (2000) localized the BIRC7 gene to
20q13.3.

;;EI24, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF;;
p53-INDUCED GENE 8; PIG8
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The EI24 gene is an immediate-early response gene that is directly
regulated by p53 (TP53; 191170), suppresses cell growth, and induces
cell death (Gu et al., 2000).

CLONING

DNA damage and/or hyperproliferative signals activate wildtype p53 tumor
suppressor protein (TP53; 191170), inducing cell cycle arrest or
apoptosis. Mutations that inactivate p53 occur in 50% of all tumors.
Polyak et al. (1997) used serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) to
evaluate cellular mRNA levels in a colorectal cancer cell line
transfected with p53. Of 7,202 transcripts identified, only 14 were
expressed at levels more than 10-fold higher in p53-expressing cells
than in control cells. Polyak et al. (1997) termed these genes
'p53-induced genes,' or PIGs, several of which, including PIG8, were
predicted to encode redox-controlling proteins. They noted that reactive
oxygen species (ROS) are potent inducers of apoptosis. Flow cytometric
analysis showed that p53 expression induces ROS production, which
increases as apoptosis progresses under some conditions. The authors
stated that PIG8 is the human homolog of murine ei24, an
etoposide-induced gene.

By analysis of a BAC clone, Gu et al. (2000) determined that the PIG8
sequence reported by Polyak et al. (1997) is incorrect and that the
corrected 358-amino acid PIG8 protein shares 98% amino acid identity
with ei24. Western blot analysis indicated that ei24 expression is
approximately 500-fold higher in dead cells than in healthy cells. Phase
contrast and fluorescence microscopy showed that cells expressing Ei24
but not those coexpressing the apoptosis suppressor BCL2L1 (600039)
displayed the typical morphologic features of apoptosis. These results
suggested that ei24 suppresses cell growth through the activation of an
apoptotic pathway.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a murine myeloid leukemia cell line expressing a
temperature-sensitive p53 gene, Gu et al. (2000) showed that ei24, the
murine homolog of PIG8, directly responds to p53 as an immediate-early
response gene and is not induced secondary to p53-mediated cell death.
Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis demonstrated that purified
wildtype p53 protein specifically binds to a p53 response element in the
ei24 protein.

MAPPING

By FISH, Gu et al. (2000) mapped the PIG8 gene to 11q23, a region
frequently altered in cancers. Gu et al. (2000) mapped the mouse Ei24
gene to the proximal region of chromosome 9.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The glutathione S-transferases (GST; EC 2.5.1.18) are a family of
enzymes responsible for the metabolism of a broad range of xenobiotics
and carcinogens (Mannervik, 1985). This enzyme catalyzes the reaction of
glutathione with a wide variety of organic compounds to form thioethers,
a reaction that is sometimes a first step in a detoxification process
leading to mercapturic acid formation.

Based on amino acid sequence similarities and antibody
cross-reactivities, the mammalian cytosolic GSTs are divided into
several classes, including alpha (e.g., 138359), mu, kappa (602321),
theta (e.g., 600436), pi (134660), omega (605482), and zeta (603758). In
addition, there is a class of microsomal GSTs (e.g., 138330). Each class
is encoded by a single gene or a gene family.

CLONING

Board (1981) showed that the most active GSTs of liver are the products
of 2 autosomal loci, GST1 (GSTM1) and GST2 (GSTA2; 138360), both of
which are polymorphic.

Strange et al. (1984) reported that GST1 is easily demonstrable in adult
liver, kidney, adrenal and stomach but is only weakly expressed in
skeletal and cardiac muscle and not at all in fetal liver, fibroblasts,
erythrocytes, lymphocytes and platelets. GST2 is not detectable in the
last 4 tissues but is found in many other tissues including fetal liver.
GST3 (GSTP1; 134660) is found in every tissue except adult liver.

DeJong et al. (1988) isolated a cDNA clone that encodes a human liver
GST H(b) subunit representing GST1.

MAPPING

By in situ hybridization, DeJong et al. (1988) mapped the GST1 gene to
chromosome 1p31. Zhong et al. (1992) used oligonucleotide primers
specific for intron 5 sequences in the GSTM1 gene to amplify a unique
718-bp fragment. They confirmed the assignment to 1p by analysis of DNA
from a panel of somatic cell hybrids and refined the localization to
1p13 by linkage analysis in 3-generation CEPH families.

Pearson et al. (1993) used locus-specific PCR primer pairs spanning exon
6, intron 6, and exon 7 as probes on DNA from human/hamster somatic cell
hybrids to map 5 glutathione transferase genes to chromosome 1: GSTM1,
GSTM2 (138380), GSTM3 (138390), GSTM4 (138333), and GSTM5 (138385). For
GSTM1, the assignment was confirmed by Southern blot hybridization. The
organization of the 5 genes was confirmed by the isolation of a YAC
clone that contained all 5. With this clone, the location of this
cluster on chromosome 1 was confirmed by fluorescence in situ
hybridization and regionalized to a point in or near 1p13.3. Xu et al.
(1998) reported that 4 mu GST genes are tightly clustered. These genes
are spaced approximately 20 kb apart and are arranged in the following
order: 5-prime--GSTM4--GSTM2--GSTM1--GSTM5--3-prime.

Islam et al. (1989) mapped a GST mu gene to human chromosome 3 (138385).

NOMENCLATURE

Mannervik et al. (1992) gave recommendations on nomenclature for human
glutathione transferases.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Data on gene frequencies of allelic variants were tabulated by
Roychoudhury and Nei (1988).

A null allele at the GSTM1 locus has a high frequency of about 0.7
(Board et al., 1990). The GST1 null phenotype has a frequency of greater
than 50% among Caucasian, Chinese, and Indian populations (Board, 1981;
Board et al., 1990).

The GSTM1 null phenotype appears to be caused by the deletion of the
GSTM1 gene (Seidegard et al., 1988, 1990).

The close physical proximity of the GSTM1 and GSTM2 loci, which share
99% nucleotide sequence identity over 460 nucleotides of 3-prime
untranslated mRNA, suggested to Pearson et al. (1993) that the GSTM1
null allele may result from unequal crossing-over. Xu et al. (1998)
constructed a partial physical map of the GST gene cluster on 1p13.3 and
localized the end points of the GSTM1 deletion. The same deletion was
found in 13 unrelated individuals (20 null alleles) examined.

In a study of liver specimens from 168 autopsies in Japanese
individuals, Harada et al. (1987) found that the null allele of GST1 was
more frequent in livers with hepatitis and carcinoma than in control
livers. This supported the notion of Board (1981) that individuals with
the null allele are exposed to elevated levels of certain electrophilic
carcinogens.

GSTM1 deficiency may be a risk factor for cancer by providing increased
sensitivity to particular chemical carcinogens (Strange et al., 1991;
van Poppel et al., 1992). Seidegard et al. (1986, 1990) found an
association between the GSTM1 null phenotype and susceptibility to lung
cancer.

Zhong et al. (1993) found a significant excess of GSTM1 null individuals
among cases of colorectal cancer: 56.1% compared with the control group
value of 41.8%. More than 70% of individuals with a tumor in the
proximal colon were GSTM1 null.

Chen et al. (1996) described a method for simultaneous characterization
of GSTM1 and GSTT1 (600436) and studied the genotypes in whites and
blacks. The frequency of the null genotype for GSTM1 (GSTM1-) was higher
in whites and that for GSTT1- was higher in blacks. The observed
frequency of the 'double null' genotype was not significantly different
from that predicted, assuming that the 2 polymorphisms are independent
and did not differ by race or sex.

McLellan et al. (1997) found that 2 Saudi Arabian individuals with
ultrarapid GSTM1 enzyme activity were heterozygous for a tandem GSTM1
gene duplication. They suggested that the duplication was generated as
the reciprocal product of the homologous unequal crossing-over event
that produces the null allele.

The formation of DNA and protein adducts by environmental pollutants is
modulated by host polymorphisms in genes that encode metabolizing
enzymes. In a study of 67 smokers, Godschalk et al. (2001) studied
aromatic-DNA adduct levels in relation to polymorphisms in GSTM1, GSTT1,
and NAT1 (108345) and NAT2 (612182). Adjusted for the amount of
cigarettes smoked per day, DNA adduct levels were higher in GSTM1 null
individuals than in GSTM1+ subjects; higher in NAT1 slow acetylators
than in NAT1 fast acetylators; and associated with the NAT2 acetylator
status for slow or fast acetylators. Highest DNA adduct levels were
observed in slow acetylators for both NAT1 and NAT2 who also lacked the
GSTM1 gene, and lowest in GSTM1+ subjects with the fast acetylator
genotype for both NAT1 and NAT2. The results showed the combined effects
of genetic polymorphisms at these 4 loci and indicated that, due to the
complex carcinogen exposure, simultaneous assessment of multiple
genotypes may identify individuals at higher cancer risk.

Patients with reduced ability to metabolize environmental carcinogens or
toxins may be at risk of developing aplastic anemia. GST has been
implicated in detoxifying mutagenic electrophilic compounds. Lee et al.
(2001) investigated whether homozygous deletions of GSTM1 and GSTT1
affect the likelihood of developing aplastic anemia. They found that the
incidence of GSTM1 and GSTT1 gene deletions was significantly higher for
aplastic anemia patients than for healthy controls (odds ratio = 3.1, p
= 0.01, and odds ratio = 3.1, p = 0.004, respectively). Among the
aplastic anemia patients, 17.5% had chromosomal abnormalities at the
time of diagnosis, and all aplastic anemia patients with chromosomal
abnormalities showed GSTT1 gene deletions.

Carless et al. (2002) examined the role of GSTM1, GSTT1, GSTP1 (134660),
and GSTZ1 (603758) gene polymorphisms in susceptibility to solar
keratoses development. Using DNA samples from volunteers involved in the
Nambour Skin Cancer Prevention Trial, allele and genotype frequencies
were determined. No significant differences were detected in GSTP1 or
GSTZ1 allele or genotype frequencies; however, a significant association
between GSTM1 genotypes and solar keratoses development was detected,
with null individuals having an approximate 2-fold increase in risk for
solar keratoses development and a significantly higher increase in risk
in conjunction with high outdoor exposure. Also, a difference in GSTT1
genotype frequencies was detected, although considering that multiple
testing was undertaken, this was found not to be significant. Fair skin
and inability to tan were found to be highly significant risk factors
for solar keratoses development, with odds ratios of 18.5 (CI, 5.7-59.9)
and 7.4 (CI, 2.6-21.0), respectively. Overall, GSTM1 conferred a
significant increase in risk of solar keratoses development,
particularly in the presence of high outdoor exposure and
synergistically with phenotypic risk factors of fair skin and inability
to tan.

Lohmueller et al. (2003) performed a metaanalysis of 301 published
genetic association studies covering 25 different reported associations.
For 8 of the associations, pooled analysis of follow-up studies yielded
statistically significant replication of the first report, with modest
estimated genetic effects. One of these 8 associations was that between
GSTM1 and head/neck cancer (275355), as first reported by Trizna et al.
(1995). Head/neck cancer showed association with homozygosity for a null
allele of the GSTM1 gene.

Verlaan et al. (2003) investigated whether polymorphisms in the GSTM1,
GSTT1, and GSTP1 genes modified the risk for chronic pancreatitis
(167800). DNA was studied from 142 adult chronic pancreatitis patients
with alcoholic (79 patients), hereditary (21 patients), or idiopathic
(42 patients) origin. The rates of GSTT1 and GSTP1 genotypes did not
differ between chronic pancreatitis patients and healthy controls;
however, GSTM1 null alleles were significantly less common in alcoholic
chronic pancreatitis patients (odds ratio = 0.56) as compared to healthy
controls and to alcoholic controls. The frequency of the GSTM1 null
genotype was significantly lower in alcoholic chronic pancreatitis
patients, especially young female patients. Thus it appears that GSTM1
null alcohol users are less susceptible to chronic pancreatitis. The
molecular change leading to the GSTM1 null phenotype is a partial gene
deletion. It is associated with complete absence of GSTM1 enzyme
activity. The frequency of the GSTM1 null genotype ranges from 23 to 62%
in different populations around the world and is approximately 50% in
Caucasians, as reviewed by Cotton et al. (2000).

Gilliland et al. (2004) found that GSTM1 and GSTP1 modify the adjuvant
effect of diesel exhaust particles on allergic inflammation. They
challenged ragweed-sensitive patients intranasally with allergen alone
and with allergen plus diesel exhaust particles, and found that
individuals with GSTM1 null or GSTP1 ile105 wildtype genotypes showed
significant increases in IgE and histamine after challenge with diesel
exhaust particles and allergens; the increase was largest in patients
with both the GSTM1 null and GSTP1 ile/ile genotypes.

French et al. (2005) genotyped 126 children with newly diagnosed acute
lymphoblastic leukemia at 16 well-characterized functional
polymorphisms. The GSTM1 null polymorphism was a significant predictor
of global gene expression, dividing patients based on their germline
genotypes. Genes whose expression distinguished the null genotype from
the non-null genotype included NBS1 (602667) and PRKR (176871). Although
GSTM1 expression is concentrated in liver, it is involved in the
conjugation (and thus transport, excretion, and lipophilicity) of a
broad range of endobiotics and xenobiotics, which French et al. (2005)
suggested could plausibly have consequences for gene expression in
different tissues.

Observational studies have provided consistent evidence for a protective
role of vegetable consumption against lung cancer, with the evidence
being most apparent for green cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli
and cabbage. Such vegetables are rich is isothiocyanates, which have
been shown in animals to have strong chemopreventative properties
against lung cancer (Hecht, 1996). In studies of the effect of
cruciferous vegetables, a definite protective effect against any type of
cancer is hard to identify, in view of the small size of studies and
potential for confounding from other dietary sources. Brennan et al.
(2005) addressed the problem of confounding by adopting a mendelian
randomization approach. Isothiocyanates are thought to be eliminated by
glutathione-S-transferase enzymes, most notably GSTM1 and GSTT1
(600430). Both GSTM1 and GSTT1 genes have null alleles with homozygous
null phenotypes, resulting in no enzyme being produced. Individuals who
are homozygous for the inactive form of either or both genes probably
have higher isothiocyanate concentrations because of their reduced
elimination capacity. Furthermore, and implicit in the mendelian
randomization approach, the roles of GSTM1 and GSTT1 genes are likely to
be independent of other dietary or lifestyle factors. To investigate the
role of cruciferous vegetable consumption in the prevention of lung
cancer in interaction with GST genotypes, Brennan et al. (2005)
investigated this relation in a case-control study of 2,141 cases and
2,168 controls in 6 countries of central and eastern Europe, a region
that has traditionally high rates of cruciferous vegetable consumption.
Weekly consumption of cruciferous vegetables protected against lung
cancer in those who were GSTM1-null (odds ratio = 0.67), GSTT1-null
(odds ratio = 0.63), or both (odds ratio = 0.28). No protective effect
was seen in people who were both GSTM1- and GSTT1-positive. Similar
protective results were noted for consumption of cabbage and a
combination of broccoli and brussels sprouts.

Through a genomewide association study, Huang et al. (2009) identified a
significant association between dbSNP rs366631, a single-nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) approximately 11 kb downstream of the GSTM1 gene, and
GSTM1 expression. Utilizing lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from
International HapMap Consortium CEU and YRI populations, the authors
determined that the dbSNP rs366631 SNP is a nonpolymorphic site. The
false genotyping call arose from sequence homology, a common GSTM1
region deletion, and a non-specific genotyping platform used to identify
the SNP. However, the HapMap call for dbSNP rs366631 genotype is an
indicator of GSTM1 upstream region deletion. Furthermore, this upstream
deletion can be used as a marker of GSTM1 gene deletion. More than 75%
of the Caucasian (CEU) samples exhibited GSTM1 deletion, and none
contained 2 copies of GSTM1. In contrast, up to 25% of African (YRI)
samples were found to have 2 copies of GSTM1. The authors concluded that
dbSNP rs366631 is a pseudo-SNP that can be used as a GSTM1 deletion
marker.

HISTORY

Scott and Wright (1980) found that the amount of GST of red cells, while
homogeneous on electrophoresis, varies more than 6-fold among
individuals. Family studies showed no correlation of levels in husbands
and wives but a strong correlation between the level in children and the
mean level of their parents. They could devise no way to use this enzyme
as a genetic marker.

DeJong et al. (1991) stated that the H(a) or A genes encode the alpha
class proteins, and the H(b) or B genes encode the mu class proteins.
They concluded that the H(b) genes of GST are located on 3 separate
chromosomes: 1, 6, and 13. They suggested that a polymorphic mu GST gene
is probably located on chromosome 13. They suggested further that this
may be a presence/absence polymorphism of a gene created through
retrotransposition.

603033	TITLE *603033 COLLAGENIC TAIL OF ENDPLATE ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE; COLQ
;;ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE-ASSOCIATED COLLAGEN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The COLQ gene encodes a collagen-like strand that associates into a
triple helix to form a tail that anchors catalytic subunits of
acetylcholinesterase (ACHE; 100740) to the basal lamina.

Asymmetric AChE is the major form of AChE at the endplate of the
neuromuscular junction in higher vertebrates. Asymmetric AChE is
composed of the T isoform of ACHE, ACHE(T), linked to a triple helical
COLQ tail. AChE rapidly hydrolyzes acetylcholine released at cholinergic
synapses in the nervous system, thus limiting the number of collisions
between ACh and the ACh receptor (AChR), and the duration of the
synaptic response (Ohno et al., 1998).

CLONING

Krejci et al. (1991) cloned ColQ from Torpedo. Krejci et al. (1997)
cloned the rat and mouse ColQ genes, and found that the ColQ subunits
form homotrimers and attach to AChE. Northern blot analysis detected
ColQ expression in cholinergic tissues, brain, muscle, and heart, as
well as in noncholinergic tissues such as lung and testes.

Ohno et al. (1998) used mouse ColQ primers to isolate human COLQ cDNA
from a human adult skeletal muscle cDNA library. The cDNA encodes a
deduced 455-amino acid protein with 89% homology to the rodent ColQ
peptide. Conserved domains include a secretion signal peptide, a
proline-rich attachment domain (PRAD) that interacts with AChE(T), 2
cysteines that form disulfide bonds with AChE(T), a collagen domain,
conserved cysteines that stabilize the tripal helical domain, and
proteoglycan binding domains that anchor the tripal helical domain to
the basal lamina. Several alternative transcripts were identified.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ohno et al. (1998) determined that the COLQ gene spans approximately 50
kb and comprises 17 constitutive exons and 2 alternatively transcribed
exons.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Ohno et al. (1998) mapped the
COLQ gene to chromosome 3p25. By radiation hybrid analysis, Donger et
al. (1998) mapped the COLQ gene to chromosome 3p24.2.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In patients with endplate AChE deficiency (EAD; 603034), Ohno et al.
(1998) identified 6 recessive mutations in the COLQ gene
(603033.0001-603033.0006). Coexpression of each of the 6 ColQ mutants
with wildtype AChE(T) in SV40-transformed monkey kidney fibroblast (COS)
cells showed that a mutation proximal to the ColQ attachment domain for
AChE(T) prevented association of ColQ with AChE(T); mutations distal to
the attachment domain generated a mutant species of acetylcholinesterase
composed of 1 AChE(T) tetramer and a truncated ColQ strand. The authors
concluded that the mutations prevented the insertion of the gene product
into the basal lamina.

In 6 sibs with a mild form of endplate AChE deficiency, Donger et al.
(1998) identified a homozygous mutation in the COLQ gene (603033.0007).

Shapira et al. (2002) reported 3 novel mutations in the COLQ gene in 8
patients with variable features of EAD: 1 patient was a compound
heterozygote; the other 7 patients, 6 Palestinian Arabs and 1 Iraqi Jew,
were all homozygous for a gly240-to-ter mutation (G240X; 603033.0010),
suggesting a founder mutation. Expression studies of the 3 mutations in
COS-7 cells showed that each prevented formation of insertion competent
asymmetric AChE.

ANIMAL MODEL

Feng et al. (1999) generated ColQ -/- mice to study the roles played by
ColQ and AChE in synapses and elsewhere. Such mice failed to thrive and
most died before reaching maturity. They completely lacked asymmetric
AChE in skeletal and cardiac muscles, specifically at the neuromuscular
junction and in the brain. Nonetheless, neuromuscular function was
present. A compensatory mechanism appeared to be a partial ensheathment
of nerve terminals by Schwann cells. Such mice also lacked the
asymmetric forms of Bche (177400). Surprisingly, globular AChE tetramers
were absent as well, suggesting a role for the ColQ gene in assembly or
stabilization of AChE forms that do not contain a collagenous subunit.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
ENDPLATE ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE DEFICIENCY
COLQ, 215-BP DEL, NT107

In a patient with endplate acetylcholinesterase deficiency (603034),
Ohno et al. (1998) found deletion of 215 basepairs following nucleotide
107 of the COLQ gene. The deletion was caused by skipping of exons 2 and
3, causing a frameshift after codon 35. The mutation abolished the
proline-rich attachment domain (PRAD) and predicted 25 missense codons
followed by a stop codon. The mutation was present in compound
heterozygous state with the E214X mutation (603033.0002). The deletion
mutation was inherited from the mother and the truncating mutation from
the father.

.0002
ENDPLATE ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE DEFICIENCY
COLQ, GLU214TER

See 603033.0001 and Ohno et al. (1998). In another patient with EAD
(603034), Ohno et al. (1998) identified homozygosity for the
glu214-to-ter (E214X) mutation.

.0003
ENDPLATE ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE DEFICIENCY
COLQ, SER169TER

In a patient with EAD (603034), Ohno et al. (1998) identified a
homozygous ser169-to-ter (S169X) mutation, which resulted in loss of the
distal two-thirds of the collagen domain.

.0004
ENDPLATE ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE DEFICIENCY
COLQ, ARG282TER

In a patient with EAD (603034), Ohno et al. (1998) identified compound
heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the COLQ gene: an arg282-to-ter
(R282X) mutation and a 1-bp deletion (1082delC). The R282X mutation
truncated COLQ 10 codons upstream to the C-terminal end of the collagen
domain. The 1-bp deletion caused a frameshift after codon 360,
predicting 64 missense codons followed by a stop codon; 1082delC spared
the entire collagen domain but abolished the C-terminal domain of COLQ.

.0005
ENDPLATE ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE DEFICIENCY
COLQ, 1-BP DEL, 1082C

See 603033.0005 and Ohno et al. (1998). In another patient with EAD
(603034), Ohno et al. (1998) identified homozygosity for the 1082delC
mutation. The asymptomatic parents were heterozygous for the mutation.

.0006
ENDPLATE ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE DEFICIENCY
COLQ, 1-BP INS, 788C

In a patient with EAD (603034), Ohno et al. (1998) identified a
homozygous 1-bp insertion (788insC) in the COLQ gene that caused a
frameshift after codon 262, predicting 36 missense codons followed by a
stop codon. The 788insC mutation spared 85% of the collagen domain. The
asymptomatic parents were heterozygous for the mutation.

.0007
ENDPLATE ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE DEFICIENCY
COLQ, TYR431SER

In 6 affected sibs in a consanguineous Spanish family with EAD (603034),
Donger et al. (1998) identified a homozygous tyr431-to-ser (Y431S)
substitution in the conserved C-terminal domain of COLQ. The mutation
was predicted to disturb the attachment of collagen-tailed
acetylcholinesterase to the neuromuscular junction. Donger et al. (1998)
referred to the disorder in these patients as CMS Ic (for congenital
myasthenic syndrome type Ic). The authors noted that most previously
described CMS Ic patients had a marked decrease in total muscle
acetylcholinesterase with essentially no collagen-tailed forms. These
forms were present in affected members of the Spanish family but the
defect interfered with attachment to the neuromuscular junction.

.0008
ENDPLATE ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE DEFICIENCY
COLQ, ARG315TER

Ohno et al. (1999) described a patient with congenital EAD (603034)
caused by compound heterozygosity for an arg315-to-ter (R315X) mutation
and a splice donor site mutation at position +3 of intron 16 of COLQ
(603033.0009).

.0009
ENDPLATE ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE DEFICIENCY
COLQ, IVS16DS, A-G, +3

See 603033.0008 and Ohno et al. (1999). Using a minigene harboring the
COLQ IVS16+3A-G mutation for functional expression studies, Ohno et al.
(1999) found that the splice site mutation resulted in skipping of exon
16. The mutant splice donor site of intron 16 harbors 5 discordant
nucleotides (at -3, -2, +3, +4, and +6) that do not basepair with U1
small nuclear (sn) RNA (RNU1; 180680), the RNA responsible for splice
donor site recognition. Versions of the minigene harboring, at either +4
or +6, nucleotides complementary to U1 snRNA restored normal splicing.
Analysis of 1,801 native splice donor sites revealed that the presence
of a G nucleotide at +3 is associated with preferential usage, at
positions +4 to +6, of nucleotides concordant to U1 snRNA. Analysis of
11 disease-associated IVS+3A-G mutations indicated that, on average, 2
of 3 nucleotides at positions +4 to +6 failed to basepair, and that the
nucleotide at +4 never basepaired, with U1 snRNA. Ohno et al. (1999)
concluded that, with G at +3, normal splicing generally depends on the
concordance that residues at +4 to +6 have with U1 snRNA, but other
cis-acting elements may also be important in assuring the fidelity of
splicing.

.0010
ENDPLATE ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE DEFICIENCY
COLQ, GLY240TER

In 6 Palestinian Arabs and 1 Iraqi Jew with variable features of EAD
(603034), Shapira et al. (2002) identified a homozygous 718G-T
transition in a splice acceptor consensus sequence of exon 12 of the
COLQ gene, resulting in a gly240-to-ter (G240X) mutation and causing
premature termination of the protein. The mutation prevented proper
formation of asymmetric AChE in COS-7 cells. The patients demonstrated
phenotypic variability, including differences in age of onset, disease
progression, respiratory and feeding difficulties, severity of weakness,
and ophthalmoplegia.

604097	TITLE *604097 UROTENSIN II; UTS2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Coulouarn et al. (1998) clearly established the existence of urotensin
II in mammals by characterizing cDNAs encoding the urotensin II
precursors not only in frog but also in human. In both species, the UTS2
sequence is located at the C-terminal position of the precursor. Human
UTS2 is composed of only 11 amino acid residues, while fish and frog
UTS2 possess 12 and 13 amino acid residues, respectively. The cyclic
region of UTS2, which is responsible for the biologic activity of the
peptide, has been fully conserved from fish to human. Northern blot and
dot blot analysis showed that UTS2 precursor mRNAs are found
predominantly in the frog and human spinal cord. In situ hybridization
studies showed that the UTS2 precursor gene is actively expressed in
motoneurons. The fact that evolutionary pressure has acted to conserve
fully the biologically active sequence of UTS2 suggests that the peptide
may exert important physiologic functions in humans.

GENE FUNCTION

Ames et al. (1999) identified a human G protein-coupled receptor, GPR14
(600896), which functions as a urotensin II receptor. Human urotensin II
binds to recombinant human GPR14 with high affinity, and the binding is
functionally coupled to calcium mobilization. Human urotensin II is
found within both vascular and cardiac tissue, including coronary
atheroma, and effectively constricts isolated arteries from nonhuman
primates. The potency of vasoconstriction of urotensin II was an order
of magnitude greater than that of endothelin-1 (131240), making human
urotensin II the most potent mammalian vasoconstrictor identified to
that time. In vivo, human urotensin II markedly increased total
peripheral resistance in anesthetized nonhuman primates, a response
associated with profound cardiac contractile dysfunction. Furthermore,
urotensin II immunoreactivity was found within the central nervous
system and endocrine tissues, suggesting that it may have additional
activities.

UTS2 has several cardiovascular actions, including potent vasoactive,
and cardiac inotropic and hypertropic properties. Douglas et al. (2002)
investigated the degree of expression of UTS2 and its receptor GPR14 in
the myocardium of patients with congestive heart failure. They obtained
specimens of myocardium from the hearts of 19 patients with end-stage
congestive heart failure, 5 patients with early-stage congestive heart
failure, and 8 healthy controls. They found strong expression of UTS2 in
the cardiomyocytes, and to a lesser extent in the vascular smooth muscle
cells, endothelial cells, and inflammatory cells of patients with
end-stage congestive heart failure. There was significantly less UTS2
expression in the myocardium of patients with early-stage congestive
heart failure, and little or no UTS2 expression in the myocardium of
healthy controls. RT-PCR showed increased concentrations of UTS2 and the
presence of urotensin receptor mRNA in the myocardium of patients with
congestive heart failure. Confocal microscopy showed a significant
increase in the binding sites for urotensin in the myocardium of
patients with end-stage congestive heart failure.

GENE FAMILY

The caudal neurosecretory system of teleost fish, which terminates in
the urophysis, exhibits morphofunctional similarities to the
hypothalamoneurohypophyseal complex (Bern et al., 1985). Two major
regulatory peptides have been isolated from urophysial extracts and
chemically characterized. Urotensin I, a 41-amino acid peptide, is
structurally similar to mammalian corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF;
122560) and to the frog skin peptide sauvagine; urotensin II (UTS2) is a
cyclic 12-amino acid peptide that has some sequence similarity, but is
not homologous, to somatostatin-14 (see 182450). The characterization of
UTS2 from the urophysis of various teleost species has shown that the
structure of the C-terminal cyclic hexapeptide has been fully conserved,
while several substitutions have occurred in the N-terminal region of
the molecule. Subsequently it was found that urotensin II-like molecules
are present in distant taxa, from mollusks to amphibians, suggesting
that urotensin-related peptides may also occur in mammals. In support of
this hypothesis, a peptide with a high degree of sequence similarity
with UTS1, called urocortin (UCN; 600945), was characterized in the rat
and human brain. In addition, specific binding sites for urotensin II
were demonstrated in rat blood vessels, and fish urotensin II was found
to exert cardiovascular effects in rat and rabbit. It was also found
that the mouse anococcygeus muscle has special sensitivity to urotensin
II (summary by Coulouarn et al., 1998).

102574	TITLE +102574 ACTININ, ALPHA-3; ACTN3
ACTN3 DEFICIENCY, INCLUDED;;
SPRINTING PERFORMANCE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Alpha-actinin is an actin-binding protein with multiple roles in
different cell types. In nonmuscle cells, the cytoskeletal isoform is
found along microfilament bundles and adherens-type junctions, where it
is involved in binding actin to the membrane (see ACTN1; 102575). In
contrast, skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle isoforms are localized to
the Z disc and analogous dense bodies, where they help anchor the
myofibrillar actin filaments. Beggs et al. (1992) characterized 2 human
muscle-specific alpha-actinin genes, ACTN2 (102573) and ACTN3. The
deduced 901-amino acid ACTN3 protein has a calculated molecular mass of
about 103 kD. ACTN3 has an N-terminal actin-binding domain of about 250
amino acids, followed by 4 central repeats and 2 EF-hand motifs near the
C terminus. Northern blot analysis of mouse tissues detected Actn3
expression in skeletal muscle, but not in heart, brain, liver, kidney,
or small intestine. ACTN3 was also detected in human fetal skeletal
muscle.

Seto et al. (2011) stated that the central repeats of ACTN3 are spectrin
(see 182860)-like repeats that form a rod domain.

MAPPING

Beggs et al. (1992) assigned the ACTN3 gene to human chromosome 11 by
use of somatic cell hybrids and narrowed the localization to chromosome
11q13-q14 by fluorescence in situ hybridization.

Mills et al. (2001) mapped the 4 murine actinin orthologs, which were
all located at evolutionarily conserved syntenic regions for the 4 human
genes.

GENE FUNCTION

Mills et al. (2001) demonstrated that murine Actn2 and Actn3 are
differentially expressed, spatially and temporally, during embryonic
development and that, in contrast to humans, alpha-actinin-2 expression
does not completely overlap alpha-actinin-3 in postnatal skeletal
muscle, suggesting independent function. Furthermore, sequence
comparison of human, mouse, and chicken alpha-actinin genes demonstrated
that ACTN3 has been conserved over a long period of evolutionary time,
implying a constraint on evolutionary rate imposed by continued function
of the gene.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

ACTN2 is expressed in all skeletal muscle fibers, whereas
alpha-actinin-3 expression is limited to a subset of type 2 (fast)
fibers. North et al. (1999) identified a common nonsense mutation in
ACTN3, arg577-to-ter (R577X; 102574.0001; dbSNP rs1815739), in the
general population in many ethnic groups. The R577X mutation had an
allele frequency ranging from 0.22 +/- 0.05 to 0.52 +/- 0.04 in ethnic
populations from Asia, the Americas, Australasia, Africa, and Europe.
Approximately 16% of the world population is predicted to have
congenital deficiency of alpha-actinin-3. No disease phenotype is
associated with this deficiency. North et al. (1999) concluded that
other factors likely compensate for the absence of alpha-actinin-3 at
the Z lines of skeletal muscle fast fibers. These results demonstrated
that ACTN3 is not an essential gene, and suggested that absence of a
structural protein caused by homozygosity for a null mutation cannot be
assumed to be disease-related without additional family and population
data.

Yang et al. (2003) demonstrated highly significant associations between
ACTN3 genotype and athletic performance. Both male and female elite
sprint athletes had significantly higher frequencies of the 577R allele
than did controls. This suggested that the presence of alpha-actinin-3
has a beneficial effect on the function of skeletal muscle in generating
forceful contractions at high velocity, and provides an evolutionary
advantage because of increased sprint performance. There is also a
genotype effect in female sprint and endurance athletes, with higher
than expected numbers of R577X heterozygotes among sprint athletes and
lower than expected numbers among endurance athletes. The lack of a
similar effect in males suggested that the ACTN3 genotype affects
athletic performance differently in males and females. The differential
effects in sprint and endurance athletes suggested that the R577X
polymorphism may have been maintained in the human population by
balancing natural selection. It is likely that there is a 'trade off'
between sprint and endurance traits that imposes important constraints
on the evolution of physical performance in humans and other vertebrates
(Garland et al., 1990). This hypothesis is supported by data from
world-class decathletes, which demonstrated that performance in the
100-meter sprint, shot put, long jump, and 110-meter hurdles (which rely
on explosive power and fast fatigue-susceptible muscle fibers) is
negatively correlated with performance in the 1,500-meter race (which
requires endurance and fatigue-resistant slow fiber activity) (Van Damme
et al., 2002).

ANIMAL MODEL

MacArthur et al. (2008) found that muscle from Actn3-knockout mice
displayed reduced force generation, reduced fast fiber diameter,
increased activity of multiple enzymes in the aerobic metabolic pathway,
altered contractile properties, and enhanced recovery from fatigue.
MacArthur et al. (2008) concluded that null mutation of ACTN3, such as
R577X, shifts the properties of fast fibers toward those characteristic
of slow fibers.

Quinlan et al. (2010) demonstrated a link between alpha-actinin-3 and
glycogen metabolism. Actn3 knockout mice had higher muscle glycogen
content and a 50% reduction in the activity of glycogen phosphorylase,
GPh (PYGM; 608455). The reduction in enzyme activity was accompanied by
altered posttranslational modification of GPh, suggesting that
alpha-actinin-3 may regulate GPh activity by altering its level of
phosphorylation. Quinlan et al. (2010) proposed that the changes in
glycogen metabolism underlie the downstream metabolic consequences of
alpha-actinin-3 deficiency.

Seto et al. (2011) found that, compared with wildtype, Actn3 -/- mouse
extensor digitorum longus muscle generated significantly reduced force
and was susceptible to contraction-induced damage during eccentric
contraction when stretched 30% above optimal length. Damage in Actn3 -/-
muscle was accompanied by upregulation of genes involved in muscle
regeneration. Expression of Actn2 was upregulated in Actn3 -/- muscle
such that the total sarcomeric content of alpha-actinin was unchanged.
The Z-disc proteins Zasp (LDB3; 605906), titin (TTN; 188840), and
vinculin (VCL; 193065) bound more avidly to Actn2 than to Actn3,
suggesting a biochemical basis for altered mechanics and fragility in
Actn3 -/- muscle.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
ACTININ, ALPHA-3 POLYMORPHISM
ACTN3 DEFICIENCY;;
SPRINTING PERFORMANCE
ACTN3, ARG577TER (dbSNP rs1815739)

North et al. (1999) identified a C-to-T transition at nucleotide 1747
(dbSNP rs1815739) in exon 16 of the ACTN3 gene, which resulted in a stop
codon replacing the arg at residue 577 (R577X). This mutation resulted
in no protein detectable by Western blot. Sixteen percent of the world
population is predicted to be homozygous for this mutation. No disease
phenotype is associated; therefore, North et al. (1999) suggested that
the ACTN3 gene is functionally redundant in humans.

Mills et al. (2001) genotyped nonhuman primates and concluded that the
R577X null mutation most likely arose in humans.

Suminaga et al. (2000) found an allele frequency of 0.49 for the 1747C-T
polymorphism in Japanese. Although the incidence (24.2%) of congenital
deficiency of alpha-actinin-3 was high, no evidence could be found that
the homozygous state modified the dystrophinopathies Duchenne muscular
dystrophy (310200) and Becker muscular dystrophy (300376).

Yang et al. (2003) found that the R577X genotype is associated with
human elite athletic performance. Both male and female elite sprint
athletes had significantly higher frequencies of the 577R allele than
did controls. In female sprint and endurance athletes there was a higher
than expected number of R577X heterozygotes among sprint athletes and
lower than expected numbers among endurance athletes. The lack of a
similar effect in males suggested that the ACTN3 genotype affects
athletic performance differently in males and females. The differential
effects in sprint and endurance athletes suggested that the R577X
polymorphism may have been maintained in the human population by
balancing natural selection.

Niemi and Majamaa (2005) determined the ACTN3 R577X genotype in 52 elite
Finnish endurance and 89 sprint athletes and found that the frequency of
the XX genotype was higher and RR lower among the endurance athletes,
and that none of the top Finnish sprinters had the XX genotype.

The association of the R577X polymorphism with elite athlete status and
human muscle performance suggests that ACTN3 deficiency influences the
function of fast muscle fibers. MacArthur et al. (2007) showed that loss
of ACTN3 expression in a knockout mouse model resulted in a shift in
muscle metabolism toward the more efficient aerobic pathway and an
increase in intrinsic endurance performance. In addition, they
demonstrated that the genomic region surrounding the 577X null allele
shows low levels of genetic variation and recombination in individuals
of European and East Asian descent, consistent with strong, recent
positive selection. They proposed that the 577X allele has been
positively selected in some human populations owing to its effect on
skeletal muscle metabolism.

In a study of 992 Greek adolescent boys and girls, Moran et al. (2007)
found a significant association between the ACTN3 R577X polymorphism and
40 meter sprint times in males (p = 0.003) that accounts for 2.3% of
phenotypic variance, with the 577R allele contributing to faster times
in an additive fashion. The R577X polymorphism was not associated with
other predominantly strength/power-related or endurance phenotypes.

In 52 white and 23 black elite-level bodybuilders and powerlifters from
the U.S., Roth et al. (2008) found significantly lower XX genotype
frequency in strength athletes (6.7%) compared to controls (16.3%; p =
0.005). The XX genotype was significantly lower in white athletes (9.7%)
compared to white controls (19.9%; p = 0.018), but did not reach
significance in black athletes (0%) compared to black controls (4.8%; p
= 0.10). Roth et al. (2008) concluded that the 577X allele is
underrepresented in elite strength athletes in addition to sprint
athletes, consistent with previous reports indicating that ACTN3
deficiency appears to impair muscle performance.

601989	TITLE *601989 S100 CALCIUM-BINDING PROTEIN A13; S100A13
DESCRIPTION Wicki et al. (1996) reported the characterization of a human gene they
symbolized S100A13, a calcium-binding protein belonging to the S100
protein family. S100 proteins are small EF-hand calcium-binding proteins
of variable lengths and sequence identities. At least 12 of 15 members
of the family are clustered on chromosome 1q21 (see S100A1; 176940);
S100A13 likewise colocalizes with S100A1 on the 1q21 cluster. The
predicted 98 amino acid S100A13 protein shows sequence homologies to
other S100 proteins between 50.5% (S100A5; 176991) and 59.3% (S100A12;
603112). Northern blot analysis showed high amounts of S100A13 mRNA in
adult skeletal muscle, heart, kidney, ovary, spleen, small intestine,
and pancreas and in fetal lung, heart, cochlea, liver, spleen, and
parathyroid tumor cells. Moderate levels were detected in all other
tissues examined, with the exception of placenta and leukocytes, which
had very low or undetectable levels. Wicki et al. (1996) also cloned the
mouse S100A13 gene. Mouse S100A13 is composed of 98 amino acids and
displays 86.7% homology compared to human S100A13.

604098	TITLE *604098 SUPPRESSOR OF G2 ALLELE OF SKP1, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; SUGT1
;;SGT1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Kitagawa et al. (1999) identified the S. cerevisiae SGT1 (suppressor of
G2 allele of SKP1) gene, which, like SKP1 (see 601434), is required for
both the G1/S and G2/M transitions in the cell cycle. The SGT1 protein
physically associates with the SKP1 protein and the SCF (SKP1/Cdc53/F
box protein) ubiquitin ligase complex (see 603134) and is required for
kinetochore function, where it serves as an activator of the Ctf13
protein. Kitagawa et al. (1999) also cloned the human homolog of the
yeast SGT1 gene. The yeast and human SGT1 proteins share 26% identity
and 30% similarity. Human SGT1 could perform the essential functions of
SGT1 in budding yeast, indicating that SGT1 function is conserved
throughout eukaryotes.

MAPPING

Gross (2012) mapped the SUGT1 gene to chromosome 13q14.3 based on an
alignment of the SUGT1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF132856) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

600412	TITLE *600412 GUANYLATE-BINDING PROTEIN 2, INTERFERON-INDUCIBLE; GBP2
;;GUANYLATE-BINDING PROTEIN 1, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF; GBP1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Guanylate-binding proteins, such as GBP2, are induced by interferon and
hydrolyze GTP to both GDP and GMP (Vestal, 2005).

CLONING

Cheng et al. (1991) cloned cDNAs for GBP1 (600411) and GBP2.

Vestal (2005) reported that the 592-amino acid GBP2 protein shares 76%
and 64% identity with GBP1 (600411) and GBP5 (611467), respectively.
Like GBP1 and GBP5, GBP2 has a C-terminal CaaX isoprenylation motif.

Olszewski et al. (2006) found that GBP2 shares 76% amino acid identity
with GBP3 (600413), but only 54% and 57% identity with GBP6 (612467) and
GBP7 (612468), respectively. All GBPs, including GBP2, have a conserved
N-terminal globular GTP-binding domain containing 2 consensus sequences
and a third T(L/V)RD sequence not found in other GTPases. EST database
analysis indicated wide expression of GBP2 in human tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

Using RT-PCR, Tripal et al. (2007) detected high expression of GBP1,
GBP2, and GBP3 in endothelial cells after stimulation with IFNG
(147570), TNF (191160), or IL1B (147720). Immunofluorescence analysis
demonstrated cytoplasmic expression of GBP2. In the presence of aluminum
fluoride, IFNG induced translocation of GBP2 to the Golgi apparatus.

Kim et al. (2011) examined a complete mouse 65-kD guanylate-binding
protein (Gbp) gene family as part of a 43-member
interferon-gamma-inducible guanosine triphosphatase superfamily in mouse
and human genomes. Family-wide loss of function analysis found that at
least 4 Gbps--Gbp1, Gbp6, Gbp7 (612468), and Gbp10--conferred
cell-autonomous immunity to listerial or mycobacterial infection within
macrophages and gene-deficient animals. These Gbps solicited host
defense proteins, including the phagocyte oxidase, antimicrobial
peptides, and autophagy effectors, to kill intracellular bacteria. Thus,
Kim et al. (2011) concluded that specific 65-kD Gbps coordinate a potent
oxidative and vesicular trafficking program to protect the host from
infection.

GENE STRUCTURE

Olszewski et al. (2006) determined that, like other GBPs, the GBP2 gene
contains 11 exons and begins translation in exon 2.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Olszewski et al. (2006) mapped the GBP2
gene to the GBP gene cluster on chromosome 1p22.2. It is located
telomeric to GBP7 and centromeric to GBP1.

602661	TITLE *602661 TUBULIN, BETA-3; TUBB3
;;TUBB4;;
TUBULIN, BETA, CLASS III
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Microtubules are dynamic polymeric structures consisting of heterodimers
of alpha-tubulins (see 602529) and beta-tubulins, such as TUBB3, that
are continuously incorporated and released. Microtubules function in
mitosis, intracellular transport, neuron morphology, and ciliary and
flagellar motility (Leandro-Garcia et al., 2010).

CLONING

Sullivan and Cleveland (1986) isolated a partial TUBB3 cDNA, which they
designated beta-4, from a human placenta cDNA library. Ranganathan et
al. (1998) cloned cDNAs encoding human TUBB3 from a prostate carcinoma
cell line.

Wang et al. (1986) cloned mouse Tubb3, which they called M-beta-3, from
testis and bone marrow cDNA libraries. Northern blot analysis detected
abundant Tubb3 expression in testis, where expression began around
postnatal day 32. Much lower Tubb3 levels were detected in all other
adult mouse tissues examined except brain, where expression was even
lower.

Burgoyne et al. (1988) stated that the mouse homolog of human TUBB3,
M-beta-6, is expressed primarily in neural tissue.

By RT-PCR analysis of a human brain cDNA library, Poirier et al. (2010)
cloned TUBB3, which encodes a 450-amino acid protein. RT-PCR,
immunocytochemical, and Western blot analyses showed that TUBB3 was
significantly expressed in fibroblasts.

Using database analysis, Leandro-Garcia et al. (2010) identified 8 major
beta-tubulins, including TUBB3. Quantitative RT-PCR of 21 normal human
tissues detected highest TUBB3 expression in brain, much lower
expression in small intestine, testis, and placenta, and little to no
expression in other tissues.

MAPPING

Tischfield et al. (2010) noted that the TUBB3 gene maps to chromosome
16q24.3.

GENE FUNCTION

Antimicrotubule drugs are used in cancer chemotherapy. By RT-PCR and
Western blot analyses, Ranganathan et al. (1998) found that drug
treatment of prostate carcinoma cells selectively increased TUBB3 mRNA
and protein levels. In brain tumor cell lines, the amount of TUBB3
protein was positively correlated with resistance to an antimicrotubule
agent. Ranganathan et al. (1998) suggested that the selective increase
in TUBB3, an isotype that imparts more dynamicity to microtubules, may
provide a way for cells to overcome the effect of antimicrotubule
agents.

Hari et al. (2003) transfected beta III tubulin into Chinese hamster
ovary cells and demonstrated that beta III tubulin diminished
microtubule assembly in a dose-dependent manner and was toxic when
present at high levels. Cells expressing beta III tubulin at moderate
levels were weakly resistant to paclitaxel, a commonly used
chemotherapeutic agent.

Raspaglio et al. (2008) found that hypoxia induced TUBB3 expression in
several human cell lines, but not in a paclitaxel-resistant cell line.
RNA interference revealed that HIF1A (603348) mediated hypoxia-induced
TUBB3 expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed that
HIF1A bound an HIF1A-binding site in the 5-prime flanking region of the
TUBB3 gene. Methylation of an enhancer in the 3-prime flanking region
abolished hypoxia-induced TUBB3 expression.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Congenital Fibrosis of Extraocular Muscles 3A

Tischfield et al. (2010) identified 8 different heterozygous mutations
in the TUBB3 gene (see, e.g., 602661.0001-602661.0005) in affected
individuals with autosomal dominant or sporadic congenital fibrosis of
extraocular muscles type 3A with or without extraocular involvement
(CFEOM3A; 600638). In vitro functional expression studies, mutant mouse
studies, and yeast studies showed that all of the mutations resulted in
altered microtubule dynamics and stability, and some showed various loss
of kinesin microtubule interactions. Most affected individuals had
congenital fibrosis of extraocular muscles, but some showed additional
defects, including developmental delay or learning disabilities
associated with dysgenesis of the corpus callosum. Other variable
features included facial weakness and peripheral axonal neuropathy,
sometimes associated with wrist and finger contractures. There were some
genotype/phenotype correlations: those with the E410K (602661.0005) and
D417H (602661.0003) mutations had a severe phenotype with additional
features, including facial weakness and learning disabilities, whereas
those with the D417N (602661.0004) mutation had peripheral neuropathy
and hypoplasia of the corpus callosum, and those with the common R262C
mutation (602661.0001) had the mildest phenotype. Overall, the findings
were consistent with defects in axonal guidance, suggesting that the
TUBB3 gene is critical for normal microtubule dynamics, axonal guidance,
and brain development.

- Complex Cortical Dysplasia With Other Brain Malformations
1

In affected members of 7 unrelated families with complex cortical
dysplasia with other brain malformations-1 (CDCBM1; 614039), Poirier et
al. (2010) identified 6 different heterozygous missense mutations in the
TUBB3 gene (see, e.g., 602661.0006-602661.0009). In vitro functional
expression studies showed that most of the mutations resulted in
impairment of the tubulin heterodimerization process or caused impaired
microtubule stability. Affected individuals had mild to severe mental
retardation, strabismus, axial hypotonia, and spasticity. Brain imaging
showed variable malformations of cortical development, including
polymicrogyria, gyral disorganization, and fusion of the basal ganglia,
as well as thin corpus callosum, hypoplastic brainstem, and dysplastic
cerebellar vermis. Extraocular muscles were not involved.

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

Three of the TUBB3 mutations identified by Poirier et al. (2010) in
patients with complex cortical dysplasia and other brain malformations
(G82R, T178M; 602661.0008, and M323V; 602661.0009) were localized to the
surface of the tubulin molecule, on the opposite side of TUBB3 mutations
reported by Tischfield et al. (2010) (R262C; 602661.0001, E410K;
602661.0005, and D417N; 602661.0004), suggesting that these 2 groups of
mutations could impair microtubules and/or their interactions with
proteins critical for microtubule function in different ways. Mutations
associated with different phenotypes might reside in different
functional areas of the protein. However, in the specific case of the
ala302 residue, the nature of the variation seemed to influence the
resulting phenotype, since the A302T (602661.0002) and A302V
(602661.0008) mutations resulted in CFEOM3A and CDCBM syndromes,
respectively.

ANIMAL MODEL

Tischfield et al. (2010) showed that heterozygous mice carrying the
R262C mutation (602661.0001) appeared healthy and had no external eye
phenotypes. Homozygous mice failed to breathe normally and died within
hours of birth. Homozygous mice showed defects in the guidance of
commissural axons and cranial nerves, and some had agenesis of the
corpus callosum; heterozygous mice had thin anterior commissures. Both
homo- and heterozygous R262C mice had decreased levels of Tubb3 protein,
but the Tubb3 protein resulted in increased microtubule stability with
decreased Kif21a (608283) microtubule interactions.

FIBROSIS OF EXTRAOCULAR MUSCLES, CONGENITAL, 3A, WITH OR WITHOUT EXTRAOCULAR
INVOLVEMENT
TUBB3, ARG262CYS

In affected members of 11 unrelated pedigrees with congenital fibrosis
of extraocular muscles-3A (600638), Tischfield et al. (2010) identified
a heterozygous 784C-T transition in exon 4 of the TUBB3 gene, resulting
in an arg262-to-cys (R262C) substitution. Several of the pedigrees had
previously been reported by Doherty et al. (1999), Gillies et al.
(1995), Mackey et al. (2002), and Yamada et al. (2004). The ocular
motility defects ranged from severe to mild. Brain MRI of affected
members in 4 pedigrees showed hypoplasia of the oculomotor nerve and the
muscles innervated by its superior division, the levator palpebrae
superioris and superior rectus, as well as the medial rectus muscle
innervated by its inferior division. The oculomotor nerve also
aberrantly innervated the lateral rectus muscle, normally innervated by
the abducens nerve. The findings were consistent with axon guidance
defects. In addition, affected individuals in some of the families
showed developmental delay or learning disabilities, and some had mild
dysgenesis of the corpus callosum. In vitro studies showed patchy mutant
heterodimer incorporation into microtubules. Further studies showed
decreased polymerization rates and increased depolymerization rates, as
well as altered interaction with kinesins. The mutation was not found in
over 1,700 control chromosomes.

TUBB3, ALA302THR

In affected members of 3 unrelated pedigrees with congenital fibrosis of
extraocular muscles-3A (600638), Tischfield et al. (2010) identified a
heterozygous 904G-A transition in exon 4 of the TUBB3 gene, resulting in
an ala302-to-thr (A302T) substitution in a region proposed to mediate
lateral interactions between tubulin heterodimers, which assemble to
form microtubules. Two affected individuals in 1 of the families showed
learning disabilities and hypoplasia of the corpus callosum. In vitro
functional expression studies showed that the A302T mutant incorporated
into microtubules, increased the stability of microtubules, and
diminished overall microtubule dynamics. The mutation was not found in
over 1,700 control chromosomes.

Notably, a mutation affecting the same residue, A302V (602661.0008), was
identified as causative of complex cortical dysplasia and other brain
malformations (614039) (Poirier et al., 2010).

TUBB3, ASP417HIS

In a mother and 2 sons with CFEOM3A (600638), Tischfield et al. (2010)
identified a heterozygous 1249G-C transversion in the TUBB3 gene,
resulting in an asp417-to-his (D417H) substitution in a region on the
external surface of microtubules that mediate interactions with motor
proteins and other proteins. Other clinical features included facial
weakness, wrist and finger contractures, peripheral axonal neuropathy in
2, and developmental delay in 1. Brain imaging was not performed. In
vitro functional expression studies in yeast showed that the mutation
resulted in altered kinesin microtubule interactions. The mutation was
not found in over 1,700 control chromosomes. Another mutation in this
residue was also identified (D417N; 602661.0004).

TUBB3, ASP417ASN

In affected members of 4 unrelated pedigrees with CFEOM3A (600638),
Tischfield et al. (2010) identified a heterozygous 1249G-A transition in
exon 4 of the TUBB3 gene, resulting in an asp417-to-asn (D417N)
substitution in a region on the external surface of microtubules that
mediate interactions with motor proteins and other proteins. Affected
members of 2 families had isolated CFEOM, but affected members in the
other 2 families also developed axonal peripheral neuropathy in the
second to third decade. One Belgian family, previously reported by
Abeloos et al. (1990), had 9 affected individuals, 4 of whom also had
developmental delay or learning disabilities. Five mutation carriers in
this family had peripheral neuropathy in the absence of CFEOM. In vitro
functional expression studies in yeast showed that the mutation resulted
in altered kinesin microtubule interactions. The mutation was not found
in over 1,700 control chromosomes. Another mutation in this residue was
also identified (D417H; 602661.0003).

TUBB3, GLU410LYS

In 6 unrelated individuals with sporadic CFEOM3A (600638), Tischfield et
al. (2010) identified a heterozygous 1228G-A transition in exon 4 of the
TUBB3 gene, resulting in a glu410-to-lys (E410K) substitution in a
region on the external surface of microtubules that mediate interactions
with motor proteins and other proteins. All of the mutations appeared to
be de novo. In addition to CFEOM, all individuals had developmental
delay and facial weakness. Some had agenesis of the corpus callosum on
brain MRI. One also had peripheral neuropathy with wrist and finger
contractures. In vitro functional expression studies and yeast studies
showed that the mutation resulted in decreased polymerization rates and
increased depolymerization rates, as well as altered kinesin microtubule
interactions. The mutation was not found in over 1,700 control
chromosomes.

CORTICAL DYSPLASIA, COMPLEX, WITH OTHER BRAIN MALFORMATIONS 1
TUBB3, THR178MET

In a patient with complex cortical dysplasia and other brain
malformations-1 (CDCBM1; 614039), Poirier et al. (2010) identified a de
novo heterozygous c.533C-T transition in exon 4 of the TUBB3 gene,
resulting in a thr178-to-met (T178M) substitution in the N-terminal
domain. The mutation was not detected in 360 Caucasian controls. Protein
modeling showed that the mutation localized to the surface of the
alpha-beta tubulin heterodimer. Structural data suggested that the
mutation may influence GTP binding. In vitro functional expression
assays showed that the mutant protein was translated and could form
tubulin heterodimers that were properly incorporated into microtubules,
although the microtubules were less stable than wildtype. The patient
had microcephaly, virtually no psychomotor development, axial hypotonia,
spastic tetraplegia, refractory epilepsy, cortical gyral
disorganization, hypoplasia of the cerebellum and brainstem, agenesis of
the corpus callosum, and fusion of the caudate and putamen.

TUBB3, GLU205LYS

In affected members of 2 unrelated families with complex cortical
dysplasia and other brain malformations-1 (614039), Poirier et al.
(2010) identified a heterozygous c.613G-A transition in exon 4 of the
TUBB3 gene, resulting in a glu205-to-lys (E205K) substitution in the
intermediate domain. The mutation occurred de novo in 1 family and was
inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern in the other family. The
mutation was not detected in 360 Caucasian controls. In vitro functional
expression studies showed that the mutant protein did not form tubulin
heterodimers and had a subtle impairment in its ability to incorporate
into the cytoskeleton. Studies of patient fibroblasts showed no major
alterations in the microtubule network, but the microtubules were less
stable than wildtype. The patients had moderate to severe mental
retardation, polymicrogyria, dysplastic cerebellum, hypoplasia of the
brainstem, and fusion of the caudate and putamen.

CORTICAL DYSPLASIA, COMPLEX, WITH OTHER BRAIN MALFORMATIONS 1
TUBB3, ALA302VAL

In 4 affected members of a family with complex cortical dysplasia and
other brain malformations-1 (614039), Poirier et al. (2010) identified a
heterozygous c.905C-T transition in exon 4 of the TUBB3 gene, resulting
in an ala302-to-val (A302V) substitution in the intermediate domain. The
mutation was not detected in 360 Caucasian controls. In vitro functional
expression studies showed that the mutant protein did not form tubulin
heterodimers. The mother had mild mental retardation, gyral
disorganization, and dysplasia of the cerebellar vermis. One of her
daughters was homozygous for the mutation and had a more severe
phenotype with axial hypotonia, gyral disorganization, dysplastic
cerebellar vermis, hypoplastic brainstem, thin corpus callosum, and
fusion of the caudate and putamen.

Notably, a mutation affecting the same residue, A302T (602661.0002), had
been identified as causative of CFEOM3A (600638) (Tischfield et al.,
2010).

CORTICAL DYSPLASIA, COMPLEX, WITH OTHER BRAIN MALFORMATIONS 1
TUBB3, MET323VAL

In a father and son with complex cortical dysplasia and other brain
malformations-1 (614039), Poirier et al. (2010) identified a
heterozygous c.967A-G transition in exon 4 of the TUBB3 gene, resulting
in a met323-to-val (M323V) substitution in intermediate domain. Protein
modeling showed that the mutation localized to the surface of the
alpha-beta tubulin heterodimer. In vitro functional expression assays
showed that the mutant protein was translated, but generated diminished
levels of tubulin heterodimers. The patients had mental retardation,
gyral disorganization, dysplastic cerebellum, hypoplastic brainstem,
thin corpus callosum, and mild fusion of the basal ganglia.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ATP2C1 is a Golgi-localized ATPase that mediates Golgi uptake of
cytosolic Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) and has a role in regulating Ca(2+) and
Mn(2+) cellular content (Ton et al., 2002).

CLONING

Hu et al. (2000) identified an EST corresponding to the ATP2C1 gene
within a 1.3-Mb YAC/BAC contig spanning the region of chromosome
3q21-q24 deleted in a family with Hailey-Hailey disease (HHD; 169600).
This EST had been annotated as homologous to a yeast gene encoding a
calcium ATPase with a function predicted to be related to that of SERCA2
(ATP2A2; 108740). Hu et al. (2000) isolated the full-length cDNA
corresponding to the human EST. Similar to other Ca(2+) ATPase genes,
the ATP2C1 gene encodes 2 alternatively spliced transcripts, ATP2C1a and
ATP2C1b. These transcripts differed in their C termini (encoding amino
acids 877 to the end), but had the same expression patterns in all
tissues examined. ATP2C1a was predicted to encode 919 amino acids, and
ATP2C1b was predicted to encode 888 amino acids. The protein encoded by
ATP2C1 was highly homologous (97% identity) to rat Pmr1, which in turn
is homologous to the yeast calcium pump Pmr1, but less homologous to
other calcium pumps. Northern blot analysis detected a 4.4-kb ATP2C1
transcript in keratinocytes and in all 12 whole tissues examined.
Highest expression was in kidney and heart, and lowest expression was in
colon, thymus, and leukocytes. Patients with HHD are not known to have
extracutaneous manifestations of the disease. Hu et al. (2000) found no
differences in ATP2C1 mRNA levels between skin taken from the axilla and
skin from the buttock (sites particularly prone vs resistant to
blistering, respectively, in HHD patients) of one normal individual and
little change in ATP2C1 mRNA levels in normal human epidermal
keratinocytes cultured with glucocorticoid.

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned ATP2C1 clone, which they designated
KIAA1347. The deduced 918-amino acid protein shares 97% identity with
its rat ortholog, a calcium-transporting ATPase. RT-PCR ELISA detected
variable ATP2C1 expression in all adult and fetal tissues examined, with
highest expression in ovary, followed by lung, testis, brain, liver, and
kidney. Within specific adult brain regions, highest expression was
detected in thalamus, followed by amygdala and substantia nigra.

Ton et al. (2002) showed that epitope-tagged human SPCA1 localized to
the Golgi compartment following expression in yeast and Chinese hamster
ovary cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hu et al. (2000) detected 27 exons in the ATP2C1 gene. Dobson-Stone et
al. (2002) detected 28 translated exons.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (2000) mapped the ATP2C1
gene to chromosome 3. Hu et al. (2000) mapped the ATP2C1 gene to
chromosome 3q21-q24.

GENE FUNCTION

Pmr1, the yeast ortholog of SPCA1, is expressed in the Golgi compartment
and functions as a high-affinity Ca(2+)/Mn(2+) pump involved in Ca(2+)
and Mn(2+) secretion. Deletion of Pmr1 in yeast causes hypersensitivity
to Ca(2+) chelators and Mn(2+) toxicity, with defects in protein
glycosylation, processing, sorting, and endoplasmic reticulum
(ER)-related glycosylation. Ton et al. (2002) found that heterologous
expression of human SPCA1, but not SERCA-type Ca(2+)-transporting
ATPases, reduced Mn(2+) toxicity and complemented Ca(2+)-related
phenotypes in Pmr1-null yeast. Yeast Golgi vesicles expressing human
SPCA1 showed high-affinity Ca(2+) transport activity that was
inhibitable by Mn(2+), but not by thapsigargin, an inhibitor of
SERCA-type ATPases. Ton et al. (2002) proposed that SPCA1 plays a role
in maintaining Ca(2+) and Mn(2+) concentrations in Golgi and the
secretory pathway.

Using RNA interference with HeLa cells, Van Baelen et al. (2003) showed
that SPCA1 was completely responsible for thapsigargin-insensitive
Ca(2+) uptake into Golgi vesicles. Knockdown of SPCA1 did not alter
Ca(2+) handling in the ER and had only a small effect on baseline
histamine-induced Ca(2+) oscillations in whole cells.

Mukhopadhyay and Linstedt (2011) found that exposure of HeLa cells to
increased extracellular Mn(2+), but not Ca(2+), induced trafficking of
the Golgi phosphoprotein GPP130 (GOLIM4; 606805) from the Golgi to
multivesicular bodies and then to lysosomes, followed by GPP130
degradation. They showed that a gln747-to-ala (Q747A) point mutation in
SPCA1 increased Golgi uptake of cellular Mn(2+), leading to increased
GPP130 degradation and reduced Mn(2+) toxicity via secretion. In
contrast, SPCA1 containing either an asp350-to-ala (D350A) mutation,
which blocks autophosphorylation and transport of Mn(2+) and Ca(2+), or
a gly309-to-cys (G309C) mutation, which blocks transport of Mn(2+), but
not Ca(2+), reduced Golgi uptake of Mn(2+), resulting in reduced GPP130
degradation and increased Mn(2+) toxicity.

Kourtis et al. (2012) demonstrated that heat stroke triggers pervasive
necrotic cell death and neurodegeneration in C. elegans. Preconditioning
of animals at a mildly elevated temperature strongly protected from
heat-induced necrosis. The heat-shock transcription factor HSF1 (140580)
and the small heat-shock protein HSP-16.1 mediate cytoprotection by
preconditioning. HSP-16.1 localizes to the Golgi, where it functions
with the calcium- and magnesium-transporting ATPase PMR1 to maintain
calcium homeostasis under heat stroke. Preconditioning also suppresses
cell death inflicted by diverse insults, and protects mammalian neurons
from heat cytotoxicity. Kourtis et al. (2012) concluded that their
findings revealed an evolutionarily conserved mechanism that defends
against diverse necrotic stimuli. In mouse cortical neurons and striatal
cells, Kourtis et al. (2012) found that overexpression of crystallin
alpha-A (123580), which colocalizes with the Golgi marker
alpha-mannosidase-II (154582) and the PMR1 ATPase, was sufficient to
protect mammalian neurons from heat stroke-induced death, even in the
absence of preconditioning. Heat stroke caused massive necrotic death
and axonal degeneration in neurons expressing short hairpin RNAs against
Pmr1, even after preconditioning.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Hailey-Hailey disease (HHD; 169600) is an autosomal dominant disorder
characterized by persistent blisters and erosions of the skin. By family
linkage studies, the HHD region was localized to 3q21-q24. Study of a
family carrying a deletion helped narrow the location. To screen HHD
patients for ATP2C1 mutations, Hu et al. (2000) identified intron sites
by comparison of genomic and cDNA sequences, designed primers flanking
the 27 identified exons, and assessed PCR products from patients and
controls by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) or
conformation-sensitive gel electrophoresis (CSGE) analyses. Among 51
unrelated kindreds of European descent and 10 of Japanese descent, they
identified 21 abnormalities (16/51 and 5/10). Of the abnormal sequences,
6 predicted single amino acid substitutions, 2 predicted aberrant
splicing, and 13 predicted prematurely truncated products through
frameshifts or single-basepair substitution. A high frequency of the
last type of mutation supported a haploinsufficiency pathogenesis
consistent with the complete deletion of the gene in 1 kindred and
further suggested that calcium pumps of the PMR1 family function as
monomers. The mechanism by which mutant ATPC1 causes acantholysis is
unknown, but it may be through abnormally elevated cytoplasmic calcium
or abnormally low Golgi Ca(2+) levels. Elevated cytoplasmic calcium
might act by altering posttranslational modification of proteins or by
inducing changes in gene expression.

Sudbrak et al. (2000) identified 13 different mutations, including
nonsense, frameshift insertion and deletions, splice-site mutations, and
nonconservative missense mutations, in ATP2C1 in patients with
Hailey-Hailey disease. The identification of ATP2A2 as the gene
defective in Darier disease (124200) provided further evidence of the
critical role of Ca(2+) signaling in maintaining epidermal integrity.

Ikeda et al. (2001) reported ATP2C1 mutations in 11 Japanese patients
with Hailey-Hailey disease. Some affected individuals had unique
clinical features (generalization of Hailey-Hailey disease and
generalized skin eruption resembling keratotic papules in Darier
disease), but other affected individuals did not, suggesting the
presence of intrafamilial phenotypic variations. These findings
reinforced the conclusion that differences in clinical phenotypes in
Hailey-Hailey disease are probably related to factors other than the
type of causative mutation.

Chao et al. (2002) identified 7 different ATP2C1 mutations, 6 of them
novel, in 7 Taiwanese kindreds with Hailey-Hailey disease. They found 3
deletion mutations, 2 nonsense mutations, 1 missense mutation, and 1
splicing mutation.

Dobson-Stone et al. (2002) screened all 28 translated exons of ATP2C1 in
24 Hailey-Hailey disease families and 3 sporadic cases and identified 22
mutations (18 novel) in 25 probands. The novel mutations comprised 3
nonsense, 6 insertion/deletion, 3 splice site, and 6 missense mutations,
and were distributed throughout the ATP2C1 gene. They noted that 6 of
the mutations were found in multiple families in their study as well as
in the studies of Sudbrak et al. (2000) and Hu et al. (2000). Haplotype
analysis revealed that 2 of these were recurrent mutations. Comparison
between genotype and phenotype in 23 families failed to yield any clear
correlation between the nature of the mutation and clinical features of
Hailey-Hailey disease. The extensive inter- and intrafamilial phenotypic
variability suggested that modifying genes and/or environmental factors
may greatly influence the clinical features of this disease.

In a patient with unilateral segmental exacerbations of Hailey-Hailey
disease, Poblete-Gutierrez et al. (2004) identified heterozygosity for a
splice site mutation in exon 22 of the ATP2C1 gene (604384.0009).
Haplotype analysis of the more severely affected segmental skin regions
revealed consistent loss of the paternal wildtype allele, confirming the
authors' hypothesis that such segmental exacerbations represent a form
of mosaicism with hemizygosity for the mutation.

a 4-bp insertion after nucleotide 767 in exon 10 of the ATP2C1 gene. The
insertion resulted in a frameshift with a premature termination codon 42
amino acids downstream of the mutation.

.0002
HAILEY-HAILEY DISEASE
ATP2C1, ALA304THR

In a family with Hailey-Hailey disease (169600), Hu et al. (2000)
identified a G-to-T transversion of nucleotide 910 of the ATP2C1 gene,
resulting in an ala304-to-thr amino acid substitution.

.0003
HAILEY-HAILEY DISEASE
ATP2C1, ARG468TER

In a family with Hailey-Hailey disease (169600), Hu et al. (2000) found
a 1402C-T transition in the ATP2C1 gene that altered codon 468 from
arginine to stop.

.0004
HAILEY-HAILEY DISEASE
ATP2C1, 4-BP DEL, 2374TTTG

In 2 unrelated families with Hailey-Hailey disease (169600), Hu et al.
(2000) found an identical 4-bp deletion of 2374delTTTG in the ATP2C1
gene. The 2 families had different alleles of the D3S1587 marker, a
locus less than 100 kb from the mutant gene, on the mutant chromosome.
This may indicate that these were independent mutations. The deletion
resulted in a premature termination codon 10 amino acids downstream of
the mutation.

.0005
HAILEY-HAILEY DISEASE
ATP2C1, IVS11, G-A, -1

Sudbrak et al. (2000) identified a G-to-A transition at the 3-prime end
of intron 11 (nucleotide position 852) of the ATP2C1 gene in a family
with Hailey-Hailey disease (169600). The effect on the cDNA was not
determined.

.0006
HAILEY-HAILEY DISEASE
ATP2C1, CYS490PHE

In a Japanese patient who represented a sporadic occurrence of
Hailey-Hailey disease (169600), Yokota et al. (2002) reported a
cys490-to-phe (C490F) amino acid substitution that arose from a 1469G-T
transversion in exon 17 of the ATP2C1 gene.

.0007
HAILEY-HAILEY DISEASE
ATP2C1, 1-BP DEL, 2460G

In a Japanese patient who represented a sporadic occurrence of
Hailey-Hailey disease (169600), Yokota et al. (2002) reported a
frameshift mutation in the ATP2C1 gene, 2460delG, that resulted in a
premature termination codon at exon 25.

.0008
HAILEY-HAILEY DISEASE
ATP2C1, LEU584PRO

In a Japanese patient who represented a sporadic occurrence of
Hailey-Hailey disease (169600), Yokota et al. (2002) reported a T-to-C
transition at nucleotide 1751 in exon 19 of the ATP2C1 gene, resulting
in a leu584-to-pro (L584P) amino acid substitution.

.0009
HAILEY-HAILEY DISEASE
ATP2C1, IVS22, G-A, +1

In a patient with unilateral segmental exacerbations of Hailey-Hailey
disease (169600), originally reported by Vakilzadeh and Kolde (1985),
Poblete-Gutierrez et al. (2004) identified heterozygosity for a G-to-A
transition at the first base of the consensus splice donor site of exon
22 of the ATP2C1 gene. The mutation, which they designated 2146+1G-A,
resulted in the skipping of the 69-bp exon 22. Haplotype analysis of the
more severely affected segmental skin regions revealed consistent loss
of the paternal wildtype allele, confirming the authors' hypothesis that
such segmental exacerbations represent a form of mosaicism with
hemizygosity for the mutation.

612658	TITLE *612658 TIGHT JUNCTION-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 1; TJAP1
;;PROTEIN INCORPORATED LATER INTO TIGHT JUNCTIONS; PILT;;
TIGHT JUNCTION PROTEIN 4; TJP4
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By yeast 2-hybrid screening of a mouse 11-day-old embryo library using
human DLG2 (603583) SH3 and GK domains as bait, Kawabe et al. (2001)
cloned mouse Tjap1, which they called Pilt. By database analysis, they
identified full-length human TJAP1, which encodes a 547-amino acid
protein with a calculated molecular mass of 60.7 kD. TJAP1 contains an
N-terminal coiled-coil domain and a central proline-rich region, and
shares 74% amino acid identity with its mouse homolog. TJAP1 shares 43%
and 51% amino acid identity over its N-terminal and C-terminal regions,
respectively, with the same regions of BEGAIN. SDS-PAGE detected TJAP1
as an 86-kD band. Northern blot analysis detected an approximately
3.0-kb transcript in all 16 human tissues examined.

GENE FUNCTION

By immunofluorescence microscopy of mouse mammary tumor cells, Kawabe et
al. (2001) localized TJAP1 to cell-cell junctions where it colocalized
with ZO-1 (TJP1; 601009) at tight junctions. Using endogenous and stably
expressed TJAP1, the authors confirmed colocalization of TJAP1 and ZO-1
to tight junctions in small intestine cells where TJAP1 localized to the
Golgi complex. TJAP1 was absent from apical junctions and desmosomes. By
observing TJAP1 incorporation into cell-cell junctions over time in a
mouse wound healing model, the authors showed that TJAP1 was
incorporated into tight junctions at the very late stages of cell-cell
junction formation. Kawabe et al. (2001) used GST pull-down assays to
confirm that TJAP1 binds DLG2. Immunohistochemical studies using
cadherin deficient L-cells expressing claudin-1 (CLDN1; 603718) or JAM
(JAM1; 605721) showed no evidence of interaction between TJAP1 and
either of these 2 proteins.

162096	TITLE *162096 MIDKINE; MDK
;;MIDGESTATION AND KIDNEY; MK;;
NEURITE GROWTH-PROMOTING FACTOR 2, FORMERLY; NEGF2, FORMERLY
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Midkine is a retinoic acid-responsive, heparin-binding growth factor
expressed in various cell types during embryogenesis. It promotes
angiogenesis, cell growth, and cell migration. Midkine is also expressed
in several carcinomas, suggesting that it may play a role in
tumorigenesis, perhaps through its effects on angiogenesis (summary by
Reynolds et al., 2004).

CLONING

Using mouse Mk to screen a midgestation human embryonic kidney cDNA
library, followed by screening a placenta genomic library, Tsutsui et
al. (1991) cloned human MDK, which they called MK. The deduced 121-amino
acid protein has a signal sequence and shares 87% identity with mouse
Mk. Orthologs of MK were detected in rat, cow, and chicken. The chicken
ortholog, Rihb, is a retinoic acid-induced heparin-binding protein. MK
shares about 50% amino acid homology with the human heparin-binding
protein pleiotrophin (PTN; 162095), with highest conservation in the
central part of the molecule and complete conservation of cysteine
residues. Northern blot analysis detected a transcript of about 1 kb in
adult human kidney and PA1 human teratocarcinoma cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Reynolds et al. (2004) found that hypoxia induced midkine expression in
alveolar epithelial cells and pulmonary vasculature in a strain of mice
sensitive to hypoxia. Hypoxia induced expression of both HIF1-alpha
(603348) and midkine in human placental adenocarcinoma, mouse fetal lung
mesenchyme, and human pulmonary adenocarcinoma cell lines. HIF1-alpha
induced midkine expression via regulatory elements in the mouse midkine
promoter. Chronic expression of midkine during embryonic development in
transgenic mice resulted in pulmonary arterial remodeling and
muscularization, but only during the postnatal phase of lung
development. In fetal mouse lung mesenchymal cells and transgenic mice,
midkine upregulated expression of myocardin (MYOCD; 606127), a regulator
of smooth muscle cell differentiation.

Intraperitoneal adhesions between organs or between organs and
peritoneal walls occur in more than 90% of cases involving major
abdominal operations. Using a model of postoperative adhesions and
Mk-null mice, Inoh et al. (2004) showed that midkine was fundamentally
involved in the formation of intraperitoneal adhesions, at least partly
by promoting migration of macrophages and neutrophils to the omentum.

Hobo et al. (2009) found that 5/6 nephrectomy in mice, a model of
chronic kidney disease, induced expression of midkine in lung, leading
to elevated angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE; 106180) activity and
plasma angiotensin II (106150) levels and subsequent hypertension.
Exposure to midkine enhanced ACE expression in primary cultured human
lung microvascular endothelial cells. Oxidative stress may have
contributed to midkine expression, since 5/6 nephrectomy induced
expression of NADH/NADPH oxidase-1 (NOX1; 300225), Nox2 (CYBB; 300481),
and Nox4 (605261). Furthermore, an antioxidant reduced midkine
expression and plasma angiotensin II levels and ameliorated hypertension
in 5/6 nephrectomized mice.

GENE STRUCTURE

Uehara et al. (1992) determined that the MDK gene contains 4 exons. The
5-prime flanking region adjacent to the start site contains 5 GC boxes,
a steroid/thyroid hormone receptor-binding site, and an A/T-rich island,
but there is no obvious CAAT box. Further upstream there is a region
with high GC content. The mouse Mdk gene has a similar organization,
with conservation of exons and significant homology in the 5-prime
region adjacent to the start site. There are 3 additional regions of
homology between mouse and human MDK in the 5-prime UTR.

MAPPING

By study of somatic cell hybrids, Eddy et al. (1991) demonstrated that
the MDK gene segregates concordantly with chromosome 11 and, using cell
hybrids carrying translocations involving chromosome 11, they mapped the
gene regionally to 11p13-p11. Kaname et al. (1993) mapped the MDK gene
to human chromosome 11p11.2 by fluorescence in situ hybridization.
Simon-Chazottes et al. (1992) mapped the mouse Mdk gene to chromosome 2,
using an interspecific backcross panel and microsatellite polymorphisms
as markers. O'Hara et al. (1995) used somatic cell hybrid analysis and
interspecific backcross analysis, respectively, to map human Mdk to
chromosome 11p13-p11 and mouse Mdk to a syntenic region of mouse
chromosome 2. They also mapped an Mdk pseudogene to mouse chromosome 11.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using microarray analysis, Ezquerra et al. (2005) found that aortae of
Mk -/- mice showed elevated expression of renin (REN; 179820),
angiotensinogen (106150), angiotensin II receptor-1 (AGTR1; 106165), and
angiotensin II receptor-2 (AGTR2; 300034) and decreased expression of
Ace.
