;;SEC31-LIKE 1; SEC31L1;;
KIAA0905
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SEC31A is a subunit of coat protein complex II (COPII)-coated vesicles,
which are essential for secretion (Jin et al., 2012).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) cloned SEC31L1, which they designated
KIAA0905. The deduced protein contains 1,220 amino acids. RT-PCR
detected moderate expression in all adult and fetal tissues and specific
brain regions examined.

By searching EST databases for sequences similar to yeast Sec31,
followed by screening a pancreas cDNA library, Tang et al. (2000) cloned
SEC31L1, which they called SEC31A. The deduced 1,218-amino acid protein
shares 25.8% identity with yeast Sec31. It contains 5 WD40 or WD40-like
repeats at its N terminus and a proline-rich region in its C-terminal
half. Northern blot analysis detected a 4-kb transcript that was
abundantly and ubiquitously expressed. In rat kidney cells, Sec31a
colocalized with Sec13 (SEC13L1; 600152) in vesicular-tubular structures
characteristic of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) exit sites.

GENE FUNCTION

By immunostaining for Sec31a in intact and permeabilized rat kidney
cells, Tang et al. (2000) found that Sec31a was not tightly associated
with the membrane. Binding of Sec31a to specific membrane structures was
restored by incubating washed cells with cytosol, indicating that Sec31a
was recruited to membranes. The membrane association of Sec31a was
greatly enhanced in the presence of a nonhydrolyzable GTP analog. Tang
et al. (2000) demonstrated that Sec31A and Sec13 coimmunoprecipitated
and that the proteins existed in a 600- to 700-kD complex.
Immunodepletion studies showed that rat Sec31a was required for
ER-to-Golgi vesicular transport.

Jin et al. (2012) found that monoubiquitination of Sec31 in mouse
embryonic stem cells by Klhl12 (614522) and the Cul3 (603136) E3
ubiquitin ligase complex was required for COPII vesicle expansion to
accommodate large cargo proteins, such as procollagens (see 120150). A
Sec31-binding mutant of Klhl12 neither colocalized with Sec31 at
intracellular vesicles nor induced formation of large vesicles.
Disruption of KLHL12-CUL3 function in human HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells
impaired COPII vesicle expansion and collagen export, but it had no
effect on export of smaller cargo by small COPII vesicles. Jin et al.
(2012) concluded that KLHL12-CUL3 monoubiquitination of SEC31 is
required for COPII vesicle expansion to accommodate large or bulky cargo
molecules.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the SEC31L1
gene to chromosome 4.

610745	TITLE *610745 STIMULATED BY RETINOIC ACID 6; STRA6
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Bouillet et al. (1997) cloned mouse Stra6. The deduced 670-amino acid
protein has 9 potential transmembrane domains. RT-PCR detected highest
Stra6 expression in brain, kidney, spleen, testis, and female genital
tract, and much lower expression in heart, lung, and liver.
Immunohistochemical analysis and in situ hybridization of embryonic and
adult mice showed that Stra6 was broadly expressed in a cell
type-specific manner. In adult mice, Stra6 was strongly expressed at
blood-organ barriers. In vitro translation resulted in a protein with an
apparent molecular mass of 74 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

Using differential subtractive hybridization, Bouillet et al. (1997)
found that expression of Stra6 was upregulated in mouse embryonal
carcinoma cells following treatment with retinoic acid. RT-PCR showed
that Stra6 transcripts accumulated in a time- and retinoic acid
concentration-dependent manner. In mouse Sertoli cells, Stra6 was
expressed in a spermatogenic cell cycle-dependent manner. However, in
testes of retinoic acid receptor-alpha (RARA; 180240)-null mice, Stra6
was abnormally expressed in all tubules.

Kawaguchi et al. (2007) identified STRA6 as the membrane receptor for
retinol binding protein (RBP1; 180260), which mediates cellular uptake
of vitamin A.

GENE STRUCTURE

Bouillet et al. (1997) determined that the mouse Stra6 gene contains 19
exons.

Pasutto et al. (2007) determined that the human STRA6 gene contains 20
exons.

MAPPING

Gross (2013) mapped the STRA6 gene to chromosome 15q24.1 based on an
alignment of the STRA6 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF370419) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Pasutto et al. (2007) observed 2 unrelated consanguineous families with
malformation syndromes sharing clinical anophthalmia and distinct
eyebrows as common signs, but differing for alveolar capillary dysplasia
or complex congenital heart defect in one and diaphragmatic hernia in
the other family (MCOPS9; 601186). Homozygosity mapping revealed linkage
to a common locus on chromosome 15, and pathogenic homozygous mutations
were identified in STRA6, a member of a large group of 'stimulated by
retinoic acid' genes encoding novel transmembrane proteins,
transcription factors, and secreted signaling molecules or proteins.
Subsequently, Pasutto et al. (2007) demonstrated homozygous STRA6
mutations in 3 of 13 patients chosen on the basis of significant
phenotypic overlap to the original cases. A homozygous deletion
generating a premature stop codon (G50AfsX22; 610745.0002) led to
absence of the immunoreactive protein in the patient's fibroblast
culture. Structural analysis of 3 missense mutations (P90L, 610745.0005;
P293L, 610745.0001; and T321P, 610745.0005) suggested significant
effects on the geometry of the loop connecting the transmembrane helices
of STRA6. Two further variations in the C terminus (T644M, 610745.0004
and R655C, 610745.0003) altered specific functional sites, an
SH2-binding motif and a phosphorylation site, respectively. STRA6
mutations thus define a pleiotropic malformation syndrome representing
the first human phenotype associated with mutations in a gene from the
STRA group.

Retinoic acid is a potent teratogen in all vertebrates when tight
homeostatic controls on its endogenous dose, location, or timing are
perturbed during early embryogenesis. STRA6 encodes an integral cell
membrane protein that favors retinoic acid uptake from soluble
retinol-binding protein; its transcription is directly regulated by
levels of retinoic acid. Golzio et al. (2007) performed molecular
analysis of the STRA6 gene in 2 families with Matthew-Wood syndrome
(MCOPS9; 601186). One of the fetuses had a homozygous insertion/deletion
in exon 2 and the other had a homozygous insertion in exon 7. Both
predicted a premature stop codon in STRA6 transcripts.

Using DNA extracted from a paraffin block of autopsy tissue from a male
infant with clinical anophthalmia and diaphragmatic eventration, who was
originally reported by Steiner et al. (2002), West et al. (2009)
identified compound heterozygosity for a 2-bp insertion and a nonsense
mutation, both in exon 2 of the STRA6 gene (610745.0009 and
610745.0010).

Segel et al. (2009) reported a 2.5-year-old girl with clinical
anophthalmia, bushy eyebrows, patent ductus arteriosus, and normal
cognitive development who was compound heterozygous for 2 missense
mutations in the STRA6 gene (610745.0012 and 610745.0013). The authors
suggested that clinical anophthalmia is the major phenotypic effect of
STRA6 mutations and that it may be compatible with normal psychomotor
development.

In a large consanguineous Irish Traveller family with isolated
microphthalmia and coloboma (MCOPCB8; see 601186), Casey et al. (2011)
identified homozygosity for a missense mutation in the STRA6 gene
(G304K; 610745.0011). Homozygosity for the same G304K mutation was
identified in 2 more Irish Traveller probands, 1 with microphthalmia and
dysplastic right kidney, and 1 who fulfilled the criteria for
Matthew-Wood syndrome (MCOPS9). Functional analysis showed that G304K
mutant STRA6 is mislocalized and has severely reduced vitamin A uptake
activity.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using a retinoic acid (RA) synthesis inhibitor in zebrafish embryos,
Casey et al. (2011) modeled different levels of RA and observed
dose-dependent microphthalmia. The inhibitor produced developmental eye
defects ranging from mild to severe microphthalmia as well as retinal
pigment epithelium coloboma, also in a range of severity. Other
developmental defects were visible, including defects in heart
morphogenesis, consistent with the role of RA in multiple developmental
processes.

MICROPHTHALMIA, SYNDROMIC 9
STRA6, PRO293LEU

In 2 affected female infants of a consanguineous Turkish family who had
bilateral clinical anophthalmia and variable pulmonary and cardiac
defects (MCOPS9; 601186), Pasutto et al. (2007) identified homozygosity
for an 878C-T transition in exon 12 of the STRA6 gene that resulted in a
pro293-to-leu (P293L) substitution. One infant died at 6 months of age
due to respiratory insufficiency and the other at 2 days of age due to a
complex cyanotic heart defect.

STRA6, 1-BP DEL, 145C

In the 14-year-old male proband of a consanguineous Turkish family who
had bilateral clinical anophthalmia, diaphragmatic hernia, atrial and
ventricular septal defects, severe short stature, and profound mental
retardation (MCOPS9; 601186), Pasutto et al. (2007) identified
homozygosity for a 1-bp insertion in exon 4 of the STRA6 gene
(145-147delC) that resulted in frameshift and premature termination of
the protein product (G50AfsX22).

.0003
MICROPHTHALMIA, SYNDROMIC 9
STRA6, ARG655CYS

In a male infant with bilateral clinical anophthalmia, left
diaphragmatic eventration, and right inguinal hernia (MCOPS9; 601186)
who died at 3 months of age, Pasutto et al. (2007) identified a
homozygous missense mutation, arg655 to cys (R655C), caused by a 1963C-T
transition in exon 20 of the STRA6 gene. The parents were distantly
related. An older brother, who had bilateral clinical anophthalmia,
truncus arteriosus communis with right aortic arch, pulmonary artery
atresia, and patent ductus arteriosus, died at age 22 months due to
thrombosis of the bronchial arterial branches. This child could feed
himself and speak in short sentences and thus showed no evidence of
mental retardation.

MICROPHTHALMIA, SYNDROMIC 9
STRA6, THR644MET

In a female infant with bilateral clinical anophthalmia, right
diaphragmatic hernia, pulmonary hypoplasia, and bilateral hydronephrosis
(MCOPS9; 601186), Pasutto et al. (2007) identified homozygosity for a
1931C-T transition in exon 20 of the STRA6 gene, resulting in a
thr644-to-met (T644M) substitution. The unaffected parents were not
known to be related. An earlier male sib had died at 24 hours of age
with pulmonary hypoplasia and unilobar left lung, tetralogy of Fallot,
patent ductus arteriosus, undescended testes, horseshoe kidney, and
hypoplastic renal arteries; an earlier female sib died within 24 hours
of birth with bilateral clinical anophthalmia, pulmonary hypoplasia with
unilobar lungs, patent ductus arteriosus, coarctation of the aorta, and
uterine dysplasia.

STRA6, PRO90LEU

In a Pakistani female infant with bilateral clinical anophthalmia, left
diaphragmatic hernia, right diaphragmatic eventration, bilateral severe
lung hypoplasia, patent ductus arteriosus, and bicornuate uterus
(MCOPS9; 601186), Pasutto et al. (2007) identified homozygosity for 2
missense mutations in the STRA6 gene. One was a 269C-T transition in
exon 6 that gave rise to a pro90-to-leu (P90L) substitution; the other,
a 961A-C transversion in exon 13, caused a thr321-to-pro (T321P)
substitution (610745.0006). The patient died at 7 hours of age; the
mother had 2 previous midtrimester miscarriages.

STRA6, 3-BP DEL/2-BP INS

In a fetus considered to have the Matthew-Wood syndrome (MCOPS9;
601186), the child of consanguineous Romanian parents, Golzio et al.
(2007) found homozygosity for an insertion/deletion in exon 2 of the
STRA6 gene (52_52delACTinsCC) that resulted in frameshift and premature
termination of the protein (asp17alafsX55). An older brother with
isolated coloboma of the retina and iris was heterozygous for the
mutation, as were the clinically unaffected parents. Intrauterine death
in the proband occurred at 31 weeks' gestation. The anatomic findings
included bilateral anophthalmia, bilateral agenesis of the lungs,
bilateral eventration of the diaphragm, bilateral absence of pulmonary
artery branches, duodenal stenosis, and annular pancreas.

STRA6, 1-BP INS, 527G

In a fetus with Matthew-Wood syndrome (MCOPS9; 601186), the child of
consanguineous Portuguese parents, Golzio et al. (2007) detected a
homozygous insertion of a single basepair in exon 7 of the STRA6 gene,
527_528insG that predicted a premature stop codon (gly176glyfsX59).
Clinical features included bilateral anophthalmia, bilateral agenesis of
the lungs, bilateral eventration of the diaphragm, pulmonary trunk and
pulmonary artery absence, ventricular septal defect, duodenal stenosis,
and absent pancreas. Intrauterine death occurred at 28 weeks' gestation.

STRA6, 2-BP INS, 277CC

Analyzing DNA extracted from a paraffin block of autopsy tissue from a
male infant with clinical anophthalmia and diaphragmatic eventration
(MCOPS9; 601186), who was originally reported by Steiner et al. (2002),
West et al. (2009) identified compound heterozygosity for a 2-bp
insertion (277insCC) in exon 2 of the STRA6 gene, predicted to cause a
frameshift and premature stop codon, and a 310G-A transition, also in
exon 2, predicted to result in a trp23-to-ter (W23X) substitution
(610745.0010). The patient was hypotonic at birth, with respiratory
distress requiring ventilator support. Multiple anomalies included flat
face with bitemporal narrowing, bilateral clinical anophthalmia, short
palpebral fissures, mildly prominent nose with anteverted nares, long
philtrum, small jaw, full cheeks, high and arched palate, bilateral
diaphragmatic eventration, cryptorchidism, and bilateral inguinal
hernia. After staged repair of the diaphragm, respiratory distress
worsened and support was withdrawn. At autopsy, the orbits lacked globes
and contained fibroadipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and retinal
rudiments. Other findings included small optic nerves, thin corpus
callosum, ostium primum and fossa ovalis atrial septal defects, severe
right ventricular hypertrophy, and incomplete lobation of the lungs. The
patient had a twin sib who was normal.

STRA6, GLY304LYS

In affected members of a large consanguineous Irish Traveller family
with isolated microphthalmia and coloboma (MCOPCB8; see 601186), Casey
et al. (2011) identified homozygosity for a 910GG-AA transition in the
STRA6 gene, resulting in a gly304-to-lys (G304K) substitution at a
highly conserved residue in the initial segment of the sixth
transmembrane domain. The mutation was not found in unaffected family
members or in 50 ethnically matched Irish Traveller controls.
Homozygosity for the G304K mutation was also found in 2 more Irish
Traveller probands, a boy with bilateral clinical anophthalmia and a
dysplastic right kidney, and a girl who fulfilled the criteria for
Matthew-Wood syndrome (MCOPS9; 601186). Haplotype analysis supported a
common ancestral origin for the disease mutation in all 3 families.
Transfection studies in COS1 cells demonstrated that the G304K mutation
almost completely abolished vitamin A uptake activity compared to
wildtype. Live-cell staining showed that the G304K mutation led to loss
of cell surface expression of STRA6; permeabilized immunostaining
demonstrated that the G304K mutant was still expressed, suggesting that
the mutation either causes misfolding of STRA6 or interferes with its
targeting mechanism to prevent cell surface expression. Casey et al.
(2011) suggested that the intrafamilial phenotypic heterogeneity might
be attributed to variability in vitamin A intake and/or uptake by RBP
(180260)/STRA6-independent mechanisms.

In a 2.5-year-old girl with clinical anophthalmia, bushy eyebrows,
patent ductus arteriosus, and normal motor and cognitive development
(MCOPS9; 601186), Segel et al. (2009) identified compound heterozygosity
for 2 missense mutations in the STRA6 gene: a 1678G-C transversion in
exon 17, resulting in an asp560-to-his (D560H) substitution, and a
1964G-A transition in exon 19, resulting in an arg655-to-his (R655H;
610745.0013) substitution. The healthy parents were each heterozygous
for 1 of the mutations, neither of which was found in 190 controls.

;;PRX2;;
PEROXIDE REDUCTASE, THIOREDOXIN-DEPENDENT; TDPX1; TPX1;;
NATURAL KILLER-ENHANCING FACTOR B; NKEFB
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Shau et al. (1994) identified a red blood cell factor, NKEF, that
enhances natural killer (NK) cell activity. By immunoscreening an
erythroleukemia cDNA library, they isolated cDNAs encoding NKEFA (PRDX1;
176763) and NKEFB. The NKEFA and NKEFB proteins contain 199 and 198
amino acids, respectively, and are 75% identical. The authors noted that
proteins related to NKEFA and NKEFB appear to be induced by oxidative
stress. Shau et al. (1994) concluded that in addition to
immunoregulation of NK activity, the NKEFs may be important for cells in
coping with oxidative insults.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and free radicals that are produced during
normal metabolism have the potential of damaging cellular
macromolecules. Defenses against such damage include a number of
antioxidant enzymes that specifically target the removal or dismutation
of the reactive agent. Pahl et al. (1995) isolated a human gene,
symbolized TDPX1 (for thioredoxin-dependent peroxide reductase-1), that
encodes an enzyme homologous to the yeast thioredoxin peroxidase (TPX).
The human coding sequence was determined from the product of a PCR
amplification of human cDNA using primers based on the rat sequence
(Chae et al., 1994). The 198-amino acid rat protein was, in turn,
isolated as a cDNA from a brain expression library with antibodies to
bovine thiol-specific antioxidant (TSA) enzyme. The rat and yeast TSA
proteins show significant similarity to Salmonella typhimurium alkyl
hydroperoxide reductase.

MAPPING

Based on PCR analysis of DNAs from a human/rodent somatic cell hybrid
panel, Pahl et al. (1995) assigned the TDPX1 locus to chromosome 13.
Further localization to 13q12 was achieved by fluorescence in situ
hybridization, using as a probe DNA from a YAC that contained the TDPX1
gene. However, Gross (2012) mapped the PRDX2 gene to chromosome 19p13.2
based on an alignment of the PRDX2 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC003022)
with the genomic sequence (GRCh37).

GENE FUNCTION

To clarify the physiologic relevance of peroxiredoxins, Lee et al.
(2003) generated a mouse model deficient in PRDX2, which is abundantly
expressed in all types of cells. The Prdx2 -/- mice were healthy in
appearance and fertile. However, they had splenomegaly caused by the
congestion of red pulp with hemosiderin accumulation. Heinz bodies were
detected in their peripheral blood, and morphologically abnormal cells
were increased in the dense red blood cell (RBC) fractions, which
contained markedly higher levels of ROS. The null mice had significantly
decreased hematocrit levels, but increased reticulocyte counts and
erythropoietin levels, indicative of a compensatory action to maintain
hematologic homeostasis. A labeling experiment in null mice showed that
a variety of RBC proteins were highly oxidized. The results suggested
that Prdx -/- mice have hemolytic anemia and that peroxiredoxin II plays
a major role in protecting RBCs from oxidative stress in mice.

Choi et al. (2005) demonstrated that PRDX2 is a negative regulator of
PDGF (see 190040) signaling. Prx II deficiency results in increased
production of peroxide, enhanced activation of PDGF receptor (PDGFR; see
173490) and phospholipase C-gamma-1 (172420), and subsequently increased
cell proliferation and migration in response to PDGF. These responses
are suppressed by expression of wildtype Prx II, but not an inactive
mutant. Notably, Prx II is recruited to PDGFR upon PDGF stimulation, and
suppresses protein tyrosine phosphatase inactivation. Prx II also leads
to the suppression of PDGFR activation in primary culture and in a
murine restenosis model, including PDGF-dependent neointimal thickening
of vascular smooth muscle cells. Choi et al. (2005) concluded that their
results demonstrate a localized role for endogenous peroxide in PDGF
signaling, and indicate a biologic function for Prx II in cardiovascular
disease.

By immunoblot, liquid chromatographic mass spectrometric,
immunoelectron, and confocal microscopic analyses, Koncarevic et al.
(2009) showed that human PRX2 was enriched in the malaria parasite,
Plasmodium falciparum. Importation of PRX2 into the parasite cytosol
compensated for the lack of catalase and glutathione peroxidase and
helped to maintain an adequate antioxidant defense. Pull-down
experiments demonstrated that PRX2 interacted with and was active with
parasite Trx1. PRX2 accounted for about half of the thioredoxin activity
in parasite extracts, and PRX2 expression was increased in the presence
of chloroquine, regardless of P. falciparum strain susceptibility to the
drug. Koncarevic et al. (2009) concluded that P. falciparum has adapted
to adopt PRX2, using the host protein for its own purposes.

O'Neill and Reddy (2011) studied circadian clocks in human red blood
cells in order to avoid the transcription-translation feedloop that is
presumed to be essential for clock formation. Human red blood cells have
no nucleus and therefore cannot perform transcription. O'Neill and Reddy
(2011) found that transcription is not required for circadian
oscillations in humans, and that nontranscriptional events seem to be
sufficient to sustain cellular circadian rhythms. Using red blood cells,
they found that peroxiredoxins, highly conserved antioxidant proteins,
undergo approximately 24-hour redox cycles, which persist for many days
under constant conditions (i.e., in the absence of external cues).
Moreover, these rhythms are entrainable (i.e., tunable by environmental
stimuli) and temperature-compensated, both key features of circadian
rhythms. O'Neill and Reddy (2011) anticipated that their findings would
facilitate more sophisticated cellular clock models, highlighting the
interdependency of transcriptional and nontranscriptional oscillations
in potentially all eukaryotic cells.

O'Neill et al. (2011) showed that nontranscriptional mechanisms are
sufficient to sustain circadian timekeeping in the eukaryotic lineage,
although they normally function in conjunction with transcriptional
components. They identified oxidation of peroxiredoxin proteins as a
transcription-independent rhythmic biomarker, which is also rhythmic in
mammals. Moreover, O'Neill et al. (2011) showed that pharmacologic
modulators of the mammalian clock mechanism have the same effects on
rhythms in Ostreococcus tauri, a unicellular pico-eukaryotic alga that
possesses a naturally minimized clock. Posttranslational mechanisms, and
at least 1 rhythmic marker, seem to be better conserved than
transcriptional clock regulators. O'Neill et al. (2011) postulated that
it is plausible that the oldest oscillator components are
nontranscriptional in nature, as in cyanobacteria, and are conserved
across kingdoms.

607096	TITLE *607096 SOLUTE CARRIER FAMILY 22 (URATE TRANSPORTER), MEMBER 12; SLC22A12
;;ORGANIC ANION TRANSPORTER 4-LIKE; OAT4L;;
URATE TRANSPORTER 1; URAT1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The SLC22A12 gene encodes URAT1, a renal urate-anion exchanger that
regulates blood urate levels.

CLONING

Enomoto et al. (2002) isolated a SLC22A12 cDNA from a human kidney cDNA
library. The cDNA, which they called URAT1 for 'urate transporter-1,'
corresponds to a gene of 2,642 basepairs encoding a protein of 555 amino
acids that is 42% identical to OAT4 (SLC22A11; 607097). The hydropathy
plot predicts 12 membrane-spanning domains in URAT1, which are similar
to those in members of the OAT family. URAT1 has 3 consensus sequences
for N-glycosylation and 2 cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase
phosphorylation sites. High stringency Northern analysis revealed
predominant expression of URAT1 mRNA in the human adult and fetal
kidney, and immunohistochemical analysis revealed that URAT1 protein is
prominent in epithelial cells of the proximal tubule of the renal
cortex. Under high magnification, the protein was found to be located in
the luminal membrane of the epithelium of proximal tubules but not in
that of distal tubules.

GENE FUNCTION

Enomoto et al. (2002) demonstrated that Xenopus oocytes injected with
URAT1 cRNA exhibited time-dependent transport activity of [14C]urate but
not of various typical substrates of OATs or organic cation
transporters. URAT1 was found to be a cotransporter with anions, in
particular chloride, bromide, or iodine, but not fluoride. Enomoto et
al. (2002) found that urate transport via URAT1 is inhibited selectively
by organic anions such as lactate, nicotinate, acetoacetate,
hydroxybutyrate, and succinate. Para-aminohippurate (PAH), the
representative substrate of OATs, did not exert an inhibitory effect on
urate uptake via URAT1, consistent with the observation that PAH has no
effect on the fractional excretion of urate in humans. Benzbromarone,
probenecid, phenylbutazone, sulfinpyrazone, nonsteroidal
antiinflammatory drugs, and diuretics inhibited urate uptake.
Trans-stimulation experiments indicated that the major counteranions
that exchange for urate via URAT1 are organic anions rather than
inorganic chloride.

Thangaraju et al. (2006) found the urinary excretion of urate was
significantly elevated in Cebpd (116898) -/- mice, although expression
of Urat1 was unaltered. However, expression of the Na(+)/lactate
cotransporters Slc5a8 (608044) and Slc5a12 (612455) was almost
completely ablated in Cebpd -/- mice. Thangaraju et al. (2006) proposed
that lactate reabsorption by SLC5A8 and SLC5A12 is coupled to urate
reabsorption by URAT1 at the proximal tubule apical membrane.

MAPPING

Enomoto et al. (2002) identified a sequence representing the SLC22A12
gene within a BAC clone (GenBank GENBANK AC044790) mapping to chromosome
11q13, near the SLC22A11 gene.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In patients with renal hypouricemia (220150), Enomoto et al. (2002) and
Tanaka et al. (2003) identified mutations in the SLC22A12 gene
(607096.0001-607096.0003).

Ichida et al. (2008) identified SLC22A12 mutations in 66 of 71 71
Japanese patients with hypouricemia. The W258X mutation (607096.0001)
was by far the most common mutation, occurring in 93 alleles, including
31 homozygotes and 23 compound heterozygotes. A total of 13 mutations,
including 3 novel mutations, were identified (see, e.g. 607096.0005;
607096.0006). Acute renal failure and urolithiasis occurred in 21.1% and
8.5% of patients, respectively. Three patients had chronic renal
failure. By haplotype analysis, Ichida et al. (2008) found that W258X
was a founder mutation with an estimated age of 6,820 years.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HYPOURICEMIA, RENAL, 1
SLC22A12, TRP258TER

In a 48-year-old male with idiopathic renal hypouricemia (220150),
Enomoto et al. (2002) identified a G-to-A transition at nucleotide 774
within exon 4 of the SLC22A12 gene, resulting in a tryptophan-to-stop
substitution at codon 258 (W258X). This mutation was found in
homozygosity and was not identified in 180 randomly chosen control
Japanese individuals.

In 2 brothers with hereditary renal hypouricemia and exercise-induced
acute renal failure, Tanaka et al. (2003) identified homozygosity for
the W258X mutation. The parents of the sibs and all of the sibs' 5
children were heterozygous for the mutation.

By haplotype analysis of 31 Japanese individuals homozygous for the
W258X mutation, Ichida et al. (2008) estimated that the mutation is
about 6,820 years old. This mutation dates back from between the time
when the Jomon people predominated in Japan and the time when the Yayoi
people started to migrate to Japan from the Korean peninsula.

.0002
HYPOURICEMIA, RENAL, 1
SLC22A12, THR217MET

In a patient with idiopathic renal hypouricemia (220150), Enomoto et al.
(2002) identified a C-to-T transition at nucleotide 650 in exon 3 of the
SLC22A12 gene, resulting in a threonine-to-methionine substitution at
codon 217 (T217M). This mutation was found in homozygosity and was not
identified in any of 180 randomly chosen control Japanese individuals.

.0003
HYPOURICEMIA, RENAL, 1
SLC22A12, GLU298ASP

In a patient with idiopathic renal hypouricemia (220150), Enomoto et al.
(2002) identified a G-to-T transversion at nucleotide 894 in exon 5 of
the SLC22A12 gene, resulting in a glutamic acid-to-aspartic acid
substitution at codon 298 (E298D). This mutation was found in
homozygosity and was not identified in any of 180 randomly chosen
control Japanese individuals.

.0004
HYPOURICEMIA, RENAL, 1
SLC22A12, LEU418ARG

In the affected member of a Japanese family with renal hypouricemia
(220150), Wakida et al. (2005) detected compound heterozygosity for
W258X (607096.0001) and for a novel mutation, a 1253T-G transversion in
the SLC22A12 gene that resulted in a leu418-to-arg (L418R) substitution
in the tenth transmembrane domain of the protein. The L418R mutation had
significantly reduced urate-transporting activities compared with
wildtype (P less than 0.05), suggesting that it is a loss-of-function
mutation.

.0005
HYPOURICEMIA, RENAL, 1
SLC22A12, ARG90HIS

In a Japanese man with renal hypouricemia (220150), Ichida et al. (2008)
identified a homozygous 269G-A transition in the SLC22A12 gene,
resulting in an arg90-to-his (R90H) substitution. Nine additional
affected individuals were compound heterozygous for R90H and W258X
(607096.0001).

.0006
HYPOURICEMIA, RENAL, 1
SLC22A12, GLY361VAL

In 2 unrelated Japanese individuals with renal hypouricemia (220150),
Ichida et al. (2008) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations
in the SLC22A12 gene: a 1082G-T transversion resulting in a
gly361-to-val (G361V) substitution, and W258X (607096.0001). In vitro
functional expression assays showed that the G361V-mutant protein had
decreased uric acid transport activity.

612385	TITLE *612385 MEDIATOR COMPLEX SUBUNIT 19; MED19
;;LUNG CANCER METASTASIS-RELATED PROTEIN 1; LCMR1;;
DT2P1G7
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MED19 is a component of the Mediator complex, which is a coactivator for
DNA-binding factors that activate transcription via RNA polymerase II
(Sato et al., 2003).

CLONING

By searching a human brain cDNA library for clones containing a CAG
repeat, Reddy et al. (1997) identified MED19, which they called DT2P1G7.
Northern blot analysis detected a 1.3-kb MED19 transcript.

Using HeLa cells overexpressing epitope-tagged MED10 (612382), Sato et
al. (2003) purified several components of the human Mediator complex,
including MED19, which they called LCMR1, and subsequently cloned the
corresponding cDNA.

GENE FUNCTION

Using in vitro-translated epitope-tagged proteins for protein-binding
assays, Sato et al. (2003) found MED19 directly interacted with Mediator
subunits SOH1 (MED31), TRAP80 (MED17; 603810), and TRAP37 (MED27;
605044). Interaction between MED19 and SOH1 was confirmed by
coimmunoprecipitation analysis of transfected 293T cells and insect
cells.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Reddy et al. (1997) mapped the MED19 gene
to chromosome 11q11.

604099	TITLE *604099 GLUTAMATE RECEPTOR, METABOTROPIC, 2; GRM2
;;MGLUR2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

L-glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the central
nervous system and activates both ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate
receptors (mGluRs). The mGluRs, which are G protein-coupled receptors,
have been divided into 3 groups on the basis of sequence homology,
putative signal transduction mechanisms, and pharmacologic properties.
Group II, which includes mGluR2 and mGluR3 (601115), and group III
mGluRs are linked to the inhibition of the cyclic AMP cascade, but
differ in their agonist selectivities.

CLONING

By screening human hippocampus and fetal brain libraries with rat mGluR2
cDNAs, Flor et al. (1995) isolated human mGluR2 cDNAs. Like other mGluRs
and G protein-coupled receptors, the predicted 872-amino acid human
mGluR2 protein contains a putative N-terminal signal sequence and 7
transmembrane domains. Human and rat mGluR2 are 97% identical on the
amino acid level. Northern blot analysis revealed that the human mGluR2
gene was expressed as a major transcript of approximately 3.5 kb and as
minor transcripts of approximately 5 and 7 kb in all tissues of the
adult central nervous system tested. When expressed in mammalian cells,
rat and human mGluR2 exhibited similar pharmacologic properties.

Tanabe et al. (1992) cloned rat brain cDNAs encoding mGluR2, mGluR3, and
mGluR4 (604100).

GENE FUNCTION

Poulopoulou et al. (2005) found significantly decreased GRM2 mRNA levels
in T lymphocytes of 20 patients with sporadic amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis (ALS; 105400) compared to healthy controls and patients with
other neurologic disorders. The authors suggested that decreased levels
of GRM2 may play a role in glutamate excitotoxicity that has been
postulated in ALS disease pathogenesis.

Metabotropic glutamate receptor-dependent long-term depression in the
ventral tegmental area efficiently reverses cocaine-induced
strengthening of excitatory inputs onto dopamine neurons. Mameli et al.
(2007) showed that metabotropic glutamate receptor long-term depression
is expressed by an exchange of GluR2-lacking AMPA receptors for
GluR2-containing receptors with a lower single-channel conductance. The
synaptic insertion of GluR2 depends on de novo protein synthesis via
rapid mRNA translation of GluR2. Mameli et al. (2007) concluded that
regulated synthesis of GluR2 in the ventral tegmental area is required
to reverse cocaine-induced synaptic plasticity.

Gonzalez-Maeso et al. (2008) demonstrated that mGluR2 interacts through
specific transmembrane helix domains with HTR2A (182135), a member of an
unrelated G protein-coupled receptor family, to form functional
complexes in brain cortex. The serotonin HTR2A receptor-mGluR2 complex
triggers unique cellular responses when targeted by hallucinogenic
drugs, and activation of mGluR2 abolishes hallucinogen-specific
signaling and behavioral responses. In postmortem schizophrenic human
brain from untreated subjects, HTR2A is upregulated and mGluR2 is
downregulated, a pattern that could predispose to psychosis.
Gonzalez-Maeso et al. (2008) concluded that the HTR2A-mGluR2 complex may
be involved in the altered cortical processes of schizophrenia.

GENE STRUCTURE

Marti et al. (2002) demonstrated that the GRM2 gene contains 5 exons,
with sizes ranging from 74 to 1,076 bp.

MAPPING

By analysis of a somatic cell hybrid panel, Flor et al. (1995) mapped
the human GRM2 gene to chromosome 3. By radiation hybrid analysis, Marti
et al. (2002) sublocalized the GRM2 gene to 3p21.2-p21.1.

ANIMAL MODEL

The mGluR2 gene is expressed in the presynaptic elements of hippocampal
mossy fiber-CA3 synapses. Yokoi et al. (1996) found that knockout mice
deficient in mGluR2 lacked long-term depression (LTD) induced by
low-frequency stimulation at hippocampal mossy fiber-CA3 synapses.
However, the mutant mice performed normally in water maze learning
tasks. The authors concluded that the presynaptic mGluR2 is essential
for inducing LTD at the mossy fiber-CA3 synapses, but that this
hippocampal LTD may not be required for spatial learning.

Morishima et al. (2005) generated mGluR2 -/- mice and observed a
significant increase in locomotor sensitization and conditioned place
preference in association with repeated cocaine administration compared
to their wildtype littermates. In vivo microdialysis analysis after
cocaine administration revealed increased extracellular levels of
dopamine and a markedly changed response pattern of glutamate release in
the nucleus accumbens of mGluR2-null mice. The null mice also exhibited
impaired motor coordination in the accelerating rota-rod test and
hyperlocomotion in novel environmental and stressful conditions.
Morishima et al. (2005) concluded that mGluR2 contributes to behavioral
responses implicated in reinforcement and addiction to cocaine, and
plays a pivotal role in synaptic regulation of glutamatergic
transmission in the neural network.

;;ONCOGENE ERBB3;;
TYROSINE KINASE-TYPE CELL SURFACE RECEPTOR HER3; HER3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Kraus et al. (1989) detected a DNA fragment related to but distinct from
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR; 131550) and ERBB2 (164870). cDNA
cloning showed a predicted 148-kD transmembrane polypeptide with
structural features identifying it as a member of the ERBB gene family,
prompting the designation ERBB3. Markedly elevated ERBB3 mRNA levels
were demonstrated in certain human mammary tumor cell lines, suggesting
that it may play a role in some human malignancies just as does EGFR
(also called ERBB1).

GENE FUNCTION

Epidermal growth factor (131530), transforming growth factor alpha
(190170), and amphiregulin (104640) are structurally and functionally
related growth regulatory proteins. They all are secreted polypeptides
that bind to the 170-kD cell-surface EGF receptor, activating its
intrinsic kinase activity. Plowman et al. (1990) speculated that these 3
proteins may differentially interact with a homolog of EGFR. They failed
to show any interaction between these 3 secreted growth factors and
ERBB2, a known EGFR-related protein. Searching for other members of this
family of receptor tyrosine kinases, however, they cloned and studied
the expression of ERBB3, which they referred to as HER3. The cDNA was
isolated from a human carcinoma cell line, and its 6-kb transcript was
identified in various human tissues.

Carraway et al. (1994) demonstrated that ERBB3 is a receptor for
heregulin (NRG1; 142445) and is capable of mediating HGL-stimulated
tyrosine phosphorylation of itself.

Memon et al. (2004) used real-time PCR to quantify expression of NRG1,
NRG2 (603818), NRG3 (605533), and NRG4 (610894) and their receptors HER3
and HER4 (ERBB4; 600543) in biopsies from 88 bladder cancer patients.
They detected NRG4 expression in 91% of bladder cancer cases, with
significantly lower expression in biopsies of superficial invasive
tumors in comparison to superficial tumors, indicating early loss of
NRG4 expression during bladder cancer progression. NRG4 downregulation
was strongly correlated with stage, grade, and type of tumor. Increased
expression of HER3, HER4, and NRG4 correlated to better survival.
Coexpression of HER3 and HER4 with NRG4 showed even better correlation
with survival (p = 0.0034 and p = 0.0080, respectively).

Jones et al. (2006) used microarrays comprising virtually every Src
homology 2 (SH2) and phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain encoded in the
human genome to measure the equilibrium dissociation constant of each
domain for 61 peptides representing physiologic sites of tyrosine
phosphorylation on the 4 ErbB receptors. By slicing through the network
at different affinity thresholds, Jones et al. (2006) found surprising
differences between the receptors. Most notably, EGFR and ErbB2 became
markedly more promiscuous as the threshold was lowered, whereas ErbB3
did not. Because EGFR and ErbB2 are overexpressed in many human cancers,
Jones et al. (2006) concluded that the extent to which promiscuity
changes with protein concentration may contribute to the oncogenic
potential of receptor tyrosine kinases.

In lung cancer specimens that had developed resistance to gefitinib,
Engelman et al. (2007) found that amplification of MET (164860) caused
gefitinib resistance by driving ERBB3-dependent activation of
phosphoinositide 3-kinase, a pathway thought to be specific to EGFR/ERBB
family receptors. Thus, Engelman et al. (2007) proposed that MET
amplification may promote drug resistance in other ERBB-driven cancers
as well.

Early social isolation results in adult behavioral and cognitive
dysfunction that correlates with white matter alterations. Makinodan et
al. (2012) showed that mice isolated for 2 weeks immediately after
weaning have alterations in prefrontal cortex function and myelination
that do not recover with reintroduction into a social environment. These
alterations, which occur only during this critical period, are
phenocopied by loss of oligodendrocyte ErbB3 receptors, and social
isolation leads to reduced expression of the ErbB3 ligand neuregulin-1
(142445). Makinodan et al. (2012) concluded that social experience
regulates prefrontal cortex myelination through neuregulin-1/ErbB3
signaling and that this is essential for normal cognitive function, thus
providing a cellular and molecular context to understand the
consequences of social isolation.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Cho and Leahy (2002) determined the 2.6-angstrom crystal structure of
the entire extracellular region of human HER3. The structure consists of
4 domains with structural homology to domains found in the type I
insulin-like growth factor receptor (147370). The HER3 structure
revealed a contact between domains II and IV that constrains the
relative orientations of ligand-binding domains and provides a
structural basis for understanding both multiple-affinity forms of EGFRs
and conformational changes induced in the receptor by ligand binding
during signaling.

MAPPING

By in situ hybridization, Kraus et al. (1989) mapped the ERBB3 gene to
chromosome 12q13.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Lethal congenital contracture syndrome type 2 (LCCS2; 607598), a
neonatally lethal form of arthrogryposis, originally described in 2
Israeli Bedouin kindreds, is characterized by multiple joint
contractures, anterior horn atrophy in the spinal cord, and a unique
feature of markedly distended urinary bladder. Narkis et al. (2007)
showed that the disorder is caused by aberrant splicing of ERBB3, which
leads to a predicted truncated protein. ERBB3, an activator of the
phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/Akt pathway, which regulates cell survival
and vesicle trafficking, is essential for the generation of precursors
of Schwann cells that normally accompany peripheral axons of motor
neurons. Gain-of-function mutations in members of the epidermal growth
factor tyrosine kinase receptor family are associated with predilection
to cancer; see ERBB2 (164870). This was the first report of a human
phenotype resulting from loss of function of a member of this group. The
human disorder is reminiscent of the phenotype of the null mutant of
this mouse ortholog. Most Erbb3-knockout embryos die before birth,
without Schwann cell precursors and Schwann cells that normally
accompany peripheral axons of sensory and motor neurons.

The Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (2007) reported an
association between dbSNP rs2292239 in the ERBB3 gene and type 1
diabetes (222100) (p = 1.49 x 10(-9); OR, 1.30). In a study of 4,000
individuals with type 1 diabetes, 5,000 controls, and 2,997 family trios
independent of the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (2007) study,
Todd et al. (2007) confirmed the previously reported association of
dbSNP rs2292239 (p = 3.83 x 10(-16); combined with WTCCC p = 1.52 x
10(-20)).

Barrett et al. (2009) reported the findings of a genomewide association
study of type 1 diabetes, combined in a metaanalysis with 2 previously
published studies (Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium, 2007; Cooper
et al., 2008). The total sample set included 7,514 cases and 9,045
reference samples. Using an analysis that combined comparisons over the
3 studies, they confirmed several previously reported associations,
including dbSNP rs2292239 at 12q13.2 (P = 2.2 x 10(-25)).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
LETHAL CONGENITAL CONTRACTURE SYNDROME 2
ERBB3, IVS10, A-G, -8

In all affected members of a large Israeli Bedouin family with lethal
congenital contracture syndrome type 2 (LCCS2; 607598), and in an
affected individual from another family, Narkis et al. (2007) found a
homozygous A-to-G substitution 8 basepairs 5-prime of exon 11 of the
ERBB3 gene (IVS10-8A-G). The mutation caused an insertion of 8 basepairs
between exons 10 and 11 and resulted in frameshift and premature
termination, generating a 399-amino acid protein instead of the native
1,341 amino acids.

605210	TITLE *605210 DISRUPTED IN SCHIZOPHRENIA 1; DISC1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

DISC1 regulates multiple aspects of embryonic and adult neurogenesis
(Kim et al., 2009).

CLONING

Millar et al. (2000) isolated and sequenced a translocation breakpoint
region on chromosome 1q42 that had been identified by St. Clair et al.
(1990) in a large Scottish family with mental and/or behavioral
disorders, including schizophrenia (see 604906), schizoaffective
disorder, recurrent major depression, and adolescent conduct and
emotional disorders. Within the 1q42 chromosomal region, Millar et al.
(2000) identified 2 novel genes directly disrupted by the translocation,
which the authors termed 'disrupted in schizophrenia' 1 and 2 (DISC1 and
DISC2, 606271). The major DISC1 gene is predicted to encode an 854-amino
acid protein containing a globular N-terminal domain and a helical
C-terminal domain with the potential to form a coiled-coil by
interaction with another protein(s). Northern blot analysis identified a
7.5-kb mRNA transcript with ubiquitous expression. DISC2 apparently
specifies a single exon thought to be a noncoding RNA molecule that is
antisense to DISC1, an arrangement that has been observed at other loci
where the antisense RNA may regulate expression of the sense gene.
Millar et al. (2000) suggested that DISC1 and DISC2 may confer
susceptibility to psychiatric illnesses.

Ma et al. (2002) cloned and characterized mouse Disc1, which encodes an
851-amino acid protein that shares 56% sequence identity with the human
protein. Both the mouse and human genes show conservation of leucine
zipper and coiled-coil domains. In situ hybridization in adult mouse
brain showed a restricted expression pattern, with highest levels in the
dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and lower expression in CA1-CA3 of the
hippocampus, cerebellum, cerebral cortex, and olfactory bulbs. Ozeki et
al. (2003) cloned and characterized mouse and rat Disc1.

Using Western blot analysis of human brain tissue and cultured human
cell lines, Sawamura et al. (2005) found that the DISC1 protein was
expressed as 2 distinct bands of 95 to 100 kD and 75 to 85 kD.
Subcellular fractionation showed that the 95- to 100-kD isoform was
enriched in the cytoplasm, whereas the 75- to 85-kD isoform was present
in both the nucleus and cytoplasm.

GENE FUNCTION

Ozeki et al. (2003) demonstrated that rodent Disc1 expression displayed
pronounced developmental regulation, with the highest levels in late
embryonic life during development of the cerebral cortex. In a yeast
2-hybrid assay of a human whole brain cDNA library, DISC1 interacted
with a variety of cytoskeletal proteins. One of these, NUDEL (NDEL1;
607538), is associated with cortical development and is linked to LIS1
(601545). A schizophrenia-associated DISC1 mutant with a C-terminal
257-residue truncation did not bind NUDEL. Expression of mutant DISC1,
but not wildtype DISC1, reduced neurite extension in rat adrenal
pheochromocytoma cells.

Using yeast 2-hybrid, mammalian 2-hybrid, and coimmunoprecipitation
assays, Morris et al. (2003) showed that DISC1 interacts with multiple
proteins of the centrosome and cytoskeletal system, including MIPT3
(607380), MAP1A (600178), and NUDEL; proteins that localize receptors to
membranes, including alpha-actinin-2 (ACTN2; 102573) and beta-4-spectrin
(SPTBN4; 606214); and proteins that transduce signals from membrane
receptors, including ATF4 (604064) and ATF5 (606398). Truncated mutant
DISC1 failed to interact with ATF4, ATF5, or NUDEL. Deletion mapping
demonstrated that DISC1 has distinct interaction domains: MAP1A
interacts via its LC2 domain with the N terminus of DISC1, whereas MIPT3
and NUDEL bind via their C-terminal domains to the central coiled-coil
domain of DISC1, and ATF4/5 bind via their C-terminal domains to the C
terminus of DISC1. In its full-length form, the DISC1 protein localized
to predominantly perinuclear punctate structures which extended into
neurites in some cells; mutant truncated DISC1, by contrast, was seen in
a diffuse pattern throughout the cytoplasm and abundantly in neurites.
Both forms colocalized with the centrosomal complex, although truncated
less abundantly than full-length DISC1. Although both full-length and
mutant DISC1 were found in microtubule fractions, neither form appeared
to bind directly to microtubules, but rather did so in a MIPT3-dependent
fashion that was stabilized by taxol. Morris et al. (2003) concluded
that DISC1 is a multifunctional protein whose truncation may contribute
to schizophrenia susceptibility by disrupting intracellular transport,
neurite architecture, and/or neuronal migration.

Millar et al. (2005) showed that DISC1 interacts with the UCR2 domain of
phosphodiesterase-4B (PDE4B; 600127), implicated in susceptibility to
schizophrenia, and that elevation of cellular cAMP leads to dissociation
of PDE4B from DISC1 and in increase in PDE4B activity. The
phosphodiesterases inactivate cAMP, a second messenger implicated in
learning, memory, and mood. Millar et al. (2005) proposed a mechanistic
model whereby DISC1 sequesters PDE4B in resting cells and releases it in
an activated state in response to elevated cAMP.

Kamiya et al. (2005) identified Disc1 as a component of the
microtubule-associated dynein motor complex in rat PC12 neural precursor
cells. Disc1 was essential for maintaining the motor complex at the
centrosome. A schizophrenia-associated C-terminally truncated Disc1
mutant functioned in a dominant-negative manner by interacting with and
redistributing wildtype Disc1 and by disassociating the Disc1-dynein
complex from the centrosome. Depletion of endogenous Disc1 by RNA
interference or expression of truncated Disc1 impaired neurite outgrowth
in PC12 cells in vitro. In embryonic mice, Disc1 RNA interference led to
impaired cerebral cortex development. Kamiya et al. (2005) concluded
that loss of normal DISC1 function during cerebral cortex development
may underlie neurodevelopmental dysfunction in schizophrenia.

Sawamura et al. (2005) analyzed the 75- to 85-kD isoform of DISC1 in
postmortem orbitofrontal cortex from 3 groups of 15 individuals with
schizophrenia, major depression, and bipolar disorder, respectively, and
15 controls. There was an increased P:S ratio (nuclear
pellet:postnuclear supernatant) in schizophrenia and major depression
compared to controls; the increase in bipolar disorder did not reach
statistical significance. The P:S ratio changes in major depression were
significantly influenced by substance/alcohol abuse and by postmortem
interval. The alteration in schizophrenic brains was not associated with
confounding factors, although an interaction with substance/alcohol
abuse could not be ruled out.

Burdick et al. (2008) noted that NDE1 (609449) is a homolog of NDEL1 and
also binds to DISC1. NDE1 was expressed at constant levels in the rat
cerebral cortex from embryonic day (E) 14 to adulthood, whereas NDEL1
expression showed a time-course increase peaking at postnatal day 7.
Further studies with a ser704-to-cys (S704C) polymorphism in the DISC1
gene showed that NDE1 bound stronger to ser704, while NDEL1 bound
stronger to cys704. The findings suggested an interaction of these 3
proteins, with possible competitive binding between NDEL1 and NDE1 for
DISC1.

Using knockdown studies, Mao et al. (2009) found that Disc1 was required
for neural progenitor cell proliferation in vitro, during embryonic
mouse brain development, and in adult mouse dentate gyrus. Disc1
interacted directly with Gsk3-beta (GSK3B; 605004) and inhibited
recombinant Gsk3-beta activity in a dose-dependent manner. This
inhibition of Gsk3-beta caused reduced phosphorylation and increased
stabilization of beta-catenin (CTNNB1; 116806). Knockdown of Disc1 in
adult mouse dentate gyrus resulted in hyperactivity and depression-like
behaviors. All effects of Disc1 knockdown were reversed by pharmacologic
inhibition of Gsk3-beta. Mao et al. (2009) concluded that DISC1
regulates neural progenitor proliferation by modulating GSK3-beta
activity and beta-catenin abundance.

By immunoprecipitation analysis of cotransfected HEK293 cells, Enomoto
et al. (2009) found that mouse Disc1 interacted with girdin (CCDC88A;
609736), a protein required for proper migration and positioning of
mouse dentate gyrus cells. Domain mapping revealed that the N-terminal
globular domain of Disc1 interacted with the N-terminal domain of
girdin. Girdin colocalized with Disc1 in cultured rat hippocampal
neurons, and knockdown of Disc1 via small interfering RNA impaired
girdin localization at growth cones.

Kim et al. (2009) found that adenovirus-mediated delivery of Kiaa1212
(CCDC88A) or a short hairpin RNA targeting Disc1 in adult mouse newborn
neurons caused elevated Akt (AKT1; 164730) signaling and resulted in a
migratory and positioning defect in the manipulated neurons. Disc1
knockdown or Kiaa1212 overexpression also caused an increase in neuronal
soma size and accelerated primary dendrite branching. Disc1 and Kiaa1212
coimmunoprecipitated from cultured mouse hippocampal neurons, dissected
adult mouse hippocampus, and transfected HEK293 cells. Direct
interaction of Disc1 with Kiaa1212 prevented Kiaa1212-dependent
activation of Akt signaling, and knockdown of Kiaa1212 abrogated
Disc1-dependent downregulation of Akt signaling. Pharmacologic blockage
of Mtor (FRAP1; 601231) also abrogated the effects of Disc1 knockdown or
Kiaa1212 overexpression, suggesting that Mtor is a major downstream
mediator of this signaling pathway.

Ishizuka et al. (2011) reported that phosphorylation of DISC1 acts as a
molecular switch from maintaining proliferation of mitotic progenitor
cells to activating migration of postmitotic neurons in mice.
Unphosphorylated DISC1 regulates canonical Wnt signaling via an
interaction with GSK3-beta, whereas specific phosphorylation at
serine-710 triggers the recruitment of Bardet-Biedl syndrome (see
209900) proteins to the centrosome. In support of this model, loss of
BBS1 (209901) leads to defects in migration, but not proliferation,
whereas DISC1 knockdown leads to deficits in both. A phospho-dead mutant
can only rescue proliferation, whereas a phospho-mimic mutant rescues
exclusively migration defects. Ishizuka et al. (2011) concluded that
their data highlight a dual role for DISC1 in corticogenesis and
indicate that phosphorylation of this protein at serine-710 activates a
key developmental switch.

By Western blot analysis of 60 fractionated postmortem brain samples
divided approximately evenly between individuals diagnosed with chronic
schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or depression, and normal controls,
Leliveld et al. (2008) found that DISC1 partitioned in the insoluble
pellet in a subset of cases with psychiatric disease. In transfected
human neuroblastoma cells, when DISC1 was expressed at low levels, it
interacted with endogenous NDEL1; in contrast, when DISC1 was expressed
at high levels, it became insoluble and did not interact with NDEL1.

Using transfected COS-7 cells and cultured rat neurons, Atkin et al.
(2012) found that overexpressed human DISC1 accumulated in perinuclear
aggregates. Insoluble DISC1 recruited endogenous DISC1 away from the
mobile pool of DISC1 puncta and disrupted mitochondrial movement.
Treatment of cultured rat neurons with hydrogen peroxide shifted the
distribution of endogenous Disc1 to an insoluble fraction. Inhibition of
the proteasome or lysosome acidification increased the number of
DISC1-containing aggregates, suggesting that overexpressed DISC1 was
recruited to the aggresome-autophagy pathway for protein removal. Atkin
et al. (2012) concluded that insoluble DISC1 associates with aggresomes
and negatively impacts neuronal function.

Eastwood et al. (2010) found that the DISC1 binding partner PCM1
(600299) was localized to the centrosome in glia of human superior
temporal gyrus, but not in neurons, which showed widespread
immunoreactivity. The authors quantified centrosomal PCM1
immunoreactivity in superior temporal gyrus glia of 81 controls and 67
subjects with schizophrenia, and genotyped the subjects for the 2 DISC1
polymorphisms leu607 to phe (dbSNP rs6675281) and ser704 to cys (dbSNP
rs821616). Centrosomal PCM1 immunoreactive area was smaller in cys704
carriers than in ser704 homozygotes, with a similar trend in phe607
homozygotes compared with leu607 carriers. No differences were seen
between controls and subjects with schizophrenia. The authors concluded
that DISC1 coding variants modulate centrosomal PCM1 localization, and
proposed a role for DISC1 in glial function that may be altered in
psychiatric disorders.

MAPPING

Ma et al. (2002) determined that the mouse Disc1 gene maps to chromosome
8 in a region with homology of synteny to human chromosome 1q42. Ma et
al. (2002) demonstrated that translin-associated factor X (TSNAX;
602964), which is situated 35 kb proximal to the DISC1 sequence on human
chromosome 1, is located approximately 20 kb proximal to Disc1 in the
mouse at 69.5 cM.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

The family studied by St. Clair et al. (1990) and Millar et al. (2000)
was originally ascertained by Jacobs et al. (1970), who reported the
translocation in the propositus, who had adolescent conduct disorder,
and in members of 4 generations of the extended family. Blackwood et al.
(2001) provided a follow-up. Of the 87 members of the family who were
karyotyped, 37 carried the (1;11)(q42;q14.3) translocation. A
psychiatric diagnosis was reached in 29 carriers, 38 noncarriers, and
the 2 founders (who were not karyotyped). The range of symptoms in this
family crossed traditional diagnostic boundaries, and the locus
identified by the breakpoint on 1q42 appeared to be implicated in either
schizophrenia or bipolar disorder (125480). Furthermore, Blackwood
(2000) reported abnormalities in the auditory P300 event-related
potential, which showed prolonged latency and reduced amplitude in
affected members of the family.

Ekelund et al. (2001) used a large, population-based study sample (221
Finnish families, 557 affected individuals) to refine the localization
of schizophrenia loci on chromosome 1q. The results were analyzed
separately for families originating from an internal isolate of Finland
and for families from the rest of Finland, as well as for all families
jointly. Evidence for linkage was obtained for 1 locus in the combined
sample (maximum lod = 2.71, D1S2709) and in the nuclear families from
outside the internal isolate (maximum lod = 3.21, D1S2709). In the
families from the internal isolate the strongest evidence for linkage
was obtained with markers located 22 cM centromeric from this marker
(maximum lod = 2.30, D1S245). The strongest evidence for linkage in the
combined study sample was obtained for marker D1S2709, which is a marker
within DISC1. In a follow-up study to Ekelund et al. (2001), Ekelund et
al. (2004) genotyped 300 polymorphic markers on chromosome 1 using a
sample of 70 Finnish families with multiple individuals affected with
schizophrenia or related conditions. They again found linkage on
chromosome 1q42 maximizing within the DISC1 gene (dbSNP rs1000731, lod
of 2.70).

By analysis of SNPs and corresponding haplotypes across candidate genes
in the 1q42 region identified by Ekelund et al. (2001) as being linked
to schizophrenia in a Finnish sample, Hennah et al. (2003) identified a
significant region of interest within the DISC1 gene. They identified a
2-SNP haplotype spanning from intron 1 to exon 2 of the DISC1 gene,
designated HEP3 (605210.0001), and demonstrated that it was
undertransmitted to affected women in the general Finnish population.
The HEP3 haplotype also displayed sex differences in transmission
distortion, the undertransmission being significant only in affected
females. Hodgkinson et al. (2004) presented data from a case-control
study of a North American white population, confirming the
underrepresentation of the HEP3 haplotype in individuals with
schizoaffective disorder. Multiple haplotypes contained within 4
haplotype blocks extending between exon 1 and exon 9 were associated
with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and bipolar disorder.
Hodgkinson et al. (2004) also found overrepresentation of a missense
allele of the DISC1 gene, leu607 to pro (L607P; dbSNP rs6675281) in
schizoaffective disorder. These data supported the idea that these
apparently distinct disorders have at least a partially convergent
etiology and that variation at the DISC1 locus predisposes individuals
to a variety of psychiatric disorders.

Cannon et al. (2005) conducted a population-based twin cohort study in
Finland to examine the association of SNPs of DISC1 and TRAX (TSNAX;
602964) with schizophrenia and several endophenotypic traits thought to
be involved in the disease pathogenesis. Two hundred and thirty-six
subjects consisting of 7 pairs concordant for schizophrenia (6
monozygotic, 1 dizygotic), 52 pairs discordant for schizophrenia (20
monozygotic, 32 dizygotic), and 59 demographically balanced normal pairs
(28 monozygotic, 31 dizygotic) were drawn from a twin cohort consisting
of all same-sex twins born in Finland from 1940 through 1957. Diagnosis
was confirmed and performance on neurocognitive tests of short- and
long-term memory as well as gray matter volume measurements as assessed
on MRI images were recorded. A common haplotype incorporating 3 SNPs
near the translocation breakpoint of DISC1 (HEP1; odds ratio, 2.6; p =
0.02) and a rare haplotype incorporating 4 markers from the DISC1 and
TRAX genes (combined HEP2/HEP3; odds ratio, 13.0; p = 0.001) were
significantly overrepresented among individuals with schizophrenia.
These haplotypes were also associated with several quantitative and
endophenotypic traits including impairments in short- and long-term
memory, functioning, and reduced gray matter density in the prefrontal
cortex.

Song et al. (2008) analyzed the regions of likely functional
significance in the DISC1 gene in 288 patients with schizophrenia and
288 controls. Six patients with schizophrenia were heterozygous for
'ultra-rare' missense variants (R37W, S90L, T603I, G14A, and R418H) not
found in 288 controls (p = 0.015) and shown to be ultra-rare by their
absence in a pool of 10,000 control alleles. Song et al. (2008)
concluded that these variants in DISC1 are associated with an
attributable risk of about 2% for schizophrenia. In addition, they
replicated the finding that 2 common structural variants (Q264R and
S704C) slightly elevate the risk for schizophrenia (OR, 1.3, 95% CI,
1.0-1.7).

Schumacher et al. (2009) reported a circumscribed interval in intron 9
of DISC1, which was significantly associated with schizophrenia in
females (p = 4.0 x 10(-5)) and contributed most strongly to early-onset
cases (p = 9.0 x 10(-5)) in a central European population of 1,621
individuals. The SNP interplay effect between dbSNP rs1538979 and dbSNP
rs821633 significantly conferred disease risk in male patients with
schizophrenia (p = 0.016; OR, 1.57). In a metaanalysis of 9
schizophrenia samples from different European populations covering 50
SNPs, the authors found evidence for a common schizophrenia risk
interval within DISC1 introns 4 to 6 (p = 0.002; OR, 1.27). Schumacher
et al. (2009) proposed a complex association between schizophrenia and
DISC1, including the presence of different risk loci and SNP interplay
effects.

ANIMAL MODEL

Hikida et al. (2007) developed a transgenic mouse model expressing a
dominant-negative truncated form of human DISC1. In vivo brain MRI
showed enlarged lateral ventricles particularly on the left side in
juvenile mutant mice, similar to asymmetric brain changes observed in
patients with schizophrenia. There was also selective reduction of
immunoreactivity to parvalbumin (PVALB; 168890) in the cortex, marking a
possible interneuron deficit. Mutant mice displayed several behavioral
abnormalities, including hyperactivity, disturbances in sensorimotor
gating and olfactory-associated behavior, and an
anhedonia/depression-like deficit. Hikida et al. (2007) suggested that
the dominant-negative human DISC1 transgenic mouse could be an animal
model for schizophrenia.

Li et al. (2007) used an inducible and reversible transgenic system to
demonstrate that early postnatal, but not adult induction, of mutant
C-terminal DISC1 in mice resulted in a cluster of schizophrenia-related
phenotypes, including reduced hippocampal dendritic complexity,
decreased hippocampal synaptic transmission, depressive-like traits,
abnormal spatial working memory, and reduced sociability. Li et al.
(2007) postulated that alterations in DISC1 function during brain
development may contribute to pathogenesis of schizophrenia.

Clapcote et al. (2007) reported the behavioral phenotypes of 2
ENU-induced Disc1 mouse mutants: Q31L and L100P, both in exon 2. All
mutant mice were viable and grossly indistinguishable from their
wildtype littermates. L110P-mutant mice showed a schizophrenic-like
phenotype, with decreased prepulse inhibition and latent inhibition that
could be ameliorated by antipsychotic treatment. In contrast,
Q31L-mutant mice showed depressive-like behavior, with deficits in the
forced swim test and other measures that could be reversed by treatment
with the antidepressant buproprion, but not by rolipram, a PDE4
inhibitor. Brain MRI showed decreased brain volume in L100P-mutant mice
(decreased by 13%) and L31-mutant mice (decreased by 6%). Both mutant
Disc1 proteins showed decreased binding to PDE4B, and Q31L-mutant mice
had decreased PDE4B activity in the brain.

Kvajo et al. (2008) generated mice carrying a deletion in the mouse
Disc1 gene, resulting in premature termination, that modeled the
disease-associated translocation identified in humans and associated
with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder by Blackwood et al. (2001).
Mutant mice had alterations in the organization of newly born and mature
neurons of the dentate gyrus. Field recordings showed a deficit in
short-term plasticity in the hippocampus of mutant mice. Both homozygous
and heterozygous mutant mice showed a selective impairment in working
memory during a battery of cognitive tests. The results were consistent
with malfunction of neural circuits.

Wood et al. (2009) mapped the expression of zebrafish Disc1 and studied
its role in early embryonic development using morpholino antisense
methods. There was a critical requirement for Disc1 in oligodendrocyte
development by promoting specification of Olig2 (606386)-positive cells
in the hindbrain and other brain regions. Disruption of neuregulin
(Nrg1; 142445) and ErbB (EGFR; 131550) signaling in zebrafish brain
development yielded similar defects to those seen in disc1 morphant
embryos. Knockdown of Disc1 or Nrg1 caused near total loss of
Olig2-positive cerebellar neurons, but caused no apparent loss of spinal
motor neurons. Wood et al. (2009) suggested that Disc1 and Nrg1 function
in common or related pathways controlling development of
oligodendrocytes and neurons from Olig2-expressing precursor cells.

In developing mouse hippocampus, Meyer and Morris (2009) showed that in
utero electroporation of Disc1 short hairpin RNAs hindered the migration
of dentate gyrus granule cells. Disc1 knockdown did not affect the
migration of CA1 pyramidal neurons, suggesting that the role of Disc1 in
regulating neuronal migration may be spatially restricted within the
hippocampus. Meyer and Morris (2009) suggested that DISC1 abnormalities
that contribute to the onset of schizophrenia may do so through their
influences on hippocampal development.

Using in utero RNA interference transfer, Niwa et al. (2010) showed that
transient knockdown of Disc1 in prefrontal cortex in mice at embryonic
day 14 led to maturation-dependent deficits in mesocortical dopaminergic
projections and associated behavioral changes, including those in
information processing and cognition.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
SCHIZOPHRENIA 9
DISC1, HAPLOTYPE, HEP3

Hennah et al. (2003) identified a common haplotype, HEP3, that was
undertransmitted in Finnish females with schizophrenia (SCZD9; 604906).
The HEP3 haplotype contains 2 SNPS in the DISC1 gene (dbSNP rs751229,
dbSNP rs3738401) that span 62 kb from intron 1 to exon 2. Hodgkinson et
al. (2004) confirmed underrepresentation of the HEP3 haplotype in
individuals with schizoaffective disorder.

Hennah et al. (2005) tested whether identified allelic haplotypes of
TRAX (602964)/DISC were associated with visual or verbal memory
dysfunction known to aggregate with schizophrenia in families. The HEP3
haplotype of DISC1 displayed association with poorer performance on
tests assessing short-term visual memory and attention. Analysis of
affected and unaffected offspring separately revealed that both samples
contributed to the observed association in visual working memory. The
results provided genetic support for the view that the DISC1 gene
contributes to sensitivity to schizophrenia and affects short-term
visual memory functions.

Among Finnish twin pairs discordant for the HEP3 haplotype, Li et al.
(2007) found a significant association between presence of the haplotype
and decreased sociability, suggesting that DISC1 has an effect on social
behavior.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

BTB/POZ domains can form homomeric or heterodimeric complexes and are
found in some viral and cellular proteins that may not be associated
with transcription. By screening mouse embryo cDNA libraries using
RT-PCR with degenerate primers to detect cDNAs encoding BTB/POZ
domain-containing proteins, followed by screening a mouse heart cDNA
library and a human genomic library, Davies et al. (1999) obtained cDNAs
encoding mouse and human LRF (leukemia/lymphoma-related factor). The
mouse and human LRF proteins share 88% amino acid identity. Northern
blot analysis revealed wide expression of 3 transcripts in various cell
lines as well as in skin, lung, and liver, but not in spleen or thymus.
Whole mount in situ hybridization analysis showed expression of Lrf in
the first 2 pharyngeal arches, limb buds, tail buds, and the neural tube
of mouse embryos, suggesting a role in stimulating cell proliferation.

By biochemical purification, micropeptide sequence analysis, EST
database searching, and screening a human embryonic carcinoma cDNA
library, Morrison et al. (1999) independently isolated a cDNA encoding
LRF, which they called FBI1 for 'factor that binds to IST,' the HIV-1
inducer of short transcripts. Sequence analysis predicted that the
584-amino acid protein contains 4 C-terminal Kruppel-type zinc fingers,
a bipartite nuclear localization signal, and an N-terminal POZ domain.
Northern blot analysis detected expression in peripheral blood
leukocytes, colon, small intestine, and ovary. SDS-PAGE and Western blot
analysis showed that FBI1 is expressed as an 86-kD protein, which is
significantly higher than its calculated molecular mass of 61.5 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

PLZF (176797) and BCL6 (109565) are BTB/POZ domain-containing zinc
finger proteins implicated in oncogenesis as well as in myelopoiesis and
lymphopoiesis, respectively. By coimmunoprecipitation and yeast 2-hybrid
analyses, Davies et al. (1999) found that LRF interacted with BCL6 but
not with PLZF. The interaction required both the BTB/POZ and zinc finger
domains of the 2 proteins. Confocal microscopy demonstrated
colocalization of LRF and BCL6 in the nucleus.

By EMSA and supershift analysis, Morrison et al. (1999) determined that
the first 2 zinc fingers of FBI1 associated with the HIV-1 IST element
and with wildtype Tat. In addition, they found that FBI1 self-associated
through its POZ domain in vitro and in vivo and through its zinc finger
domains in vivo only.

Maeda et al. (2005) identified the transcriptional repressor FBI1, which
they called Pokemon (POK erythroid myeloid ontogenic factor), as a
critical factor in oncogenesis. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking
Zbtb7 were completely refractory to oncogene-mediated cellular
transformation. Conversely, FBI1 overexpression led to overt oncogenic
transformation both in vitro and in vivo in transgenic mice. FBI1 can
specifically repress the transcription of the tumor suppressor gene ARF
(600160) through direct binding. Maeda et al. (2005) found that FBI1 is
aberrantly overexpressed in human cancers, and its expression levels
predict biologic behavior and clinical outcome.

MAPPING

Davies et al. (1999) mapped the LRF gene to 19p13.3 by FISH.

ANIMAL MODEL

Maeda et al. (2007) found that Lrf -/- mice exhibited embryonic
lethality at 16.5 days postcoitum due to severe anemia, which was
preceded by reduced numbers of fetal liver B lymphocytes after the pro-B
stage of differentiation. In contrast, T-cell levels in mice with a
conditionally deleted Lrf gene were comparable to those in control mice,
but polyclonal extrathymic Cd4/Cd8 double-positive cells accumulated in
the marrow. Treatment of Lrf conditional knockout mice with a
gamma-secretase inhibitor, which also inhibits Notch (see 190198)
signaling, rescued abnormal B- and T-cell commitment and led to
resumption of Vpreb1 (605141) expression. Maeda et al. (2007) concluded
that LRF acts as a master regulator in determination of B versus T
lymphoid fate by negatively regulating T-lineage commitment by opposing
NOTCH function. Thus, loss of LRF results in aberrant activation of the
NOTCH pathway, with upregulation of NOTCH target genes in hemopoietic
stem cells and common lymphoid progenitors.

601914	TITLE *601914 PROLINE ARGININE-RICH END LEUCINE-RICH REPEAT PROTEIN; PRELP
DESCRIPTION PRELP (proline arginine-rich end leucine-rich repeat protein) is a
connective tissue glycoprotein of the leucine-rich-repeat (LRR) family.
The LRR motif is believed to participate in protein-protein
interactions; Bengtsson et al. (1995) stated that this motif is found in
several matrix-binding proteins. Bengtsson et al. (1995) isolated the
58-kD PRELP protein from bovine articular cartilage and cloned the human
PRELP cDNA from an articular chondrocyte cDNA library. Sequencing
revealed that the gene encodes a 382-amino acid polypeptide with a
calculated molecular mass of 42 kD. The protein sequence contains a
putative secretory signal sequence, 10 leucine-rich repeats, several
glycosylation sites, and a proline- and arginine-rich N-terminus. They
reported that the protein sequence was 36% similar to fibromodulin
(600245) and 33% similar to bovine lumican (see 600616).

Grover et al. (1996) characterized the expression pattern and genomic
structure of human PRELP. They determined that PRELP is encoded by
messages of 1.7, 4.6, and 6.7 kb, in descending order of expression
level. The messages are abundant in juvenile and adult cartilage, but
not present in neonatal cartilage nor in cultured fibroblasts. Among
other adult tissues, PRELP is expressed in lung. Grover et al. (1996)
reported that the PRELP gene contains 2 introns. They mapped the gene to
human chromosome 1q32; interestingly, the fibromodulin gene also resides
at this location.

613590	TITLE *613590 BUTYROPHILIN, SUBFAMILY 2, MEMBER A1; BTN2A1
;;BT2.1;;
BTF1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The butyrophilin (BTN) genes are a group of major histocompatibility
complex (MHC)-associated genes that encode type I membrane proteins with
2 extracellular immunoglobulin (Ig) domains and an intracellular B30.2
(PRYSPRY) domain. Three subfamilies of human BTN genes are located in
the MHC class I region: the single-copy BTN1A1 gene (601610) and the
BTN2 (e.g., BTN2A1) and BTN3 (e.g., BNT3A1; 613593) genes, which have
undergone tandem duplication, resulting in 3 copies of each (summary by
Smith et al., 2010).

CLONING

By genomic sequence analysis, RT-PCR of peripheral blood leukocytes and
human cell lines, and 3-prime RACE of a fetal tissue cDNA library,
Rhodes et al. (2001) cloned BTN2A1. They also identified alternative
splicing affecting the 3-prime end of BTN2A1. Immunofluorescence
microscopy showed surface expression of BTN2A1 in transfected HeLa and
Chinese hamster ovary cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Rhodes et al. (2001) determined that the BTN2A1 gene spans approximately
12 kb and contains 7 coding exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Rhodes et al. (2001) mapped the BTN2A1
gene within the BTN gene cluster on chromosome 6p22.1. The BTN gene
cluster is located about 4 Mb telomeric to the classical MHC class I
genes.

602740	TITLE *602740 PROTEIN KINASE, AMP-ACTIVATED, NONCATALYTIC, BETA-1; PRKAB1
;;AMP-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE, NONCATALYTIC, BETA-1;;
AMPK-BETA-1
DESCRIPTION The mammalian 5-prime-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) appears to act
as a metabolic stress-sensing protein kinase. AMPK is a heterotrimeric
protein composed of a catalytic alpha subunit, a noncatalytic beta
subunit, and a noncatalytic gamma subunit. See PRKAA1 (602739) for
additional background.

CLONING

Using PCR with degenerate oligonucleotides based on the rat Ampk-beta-1
protein sequence, Woods et al. (1996) isolated rat liver cDNAs encoding
Ampk-beta-1. Both the Ampk-beta-1 mRNA and protein are widely expressed
in rat tissues. The predicted 270-amino acid protein has a calculated
mass of 30 kD, but Woods et al. (1996) reported that it migrates as a
38-kD protein by SDS-PAGE. Immunoprecipitation studies suggested that
Ampk-beta-1 mediates the association of the AMPK heterotrimeric complex
in vitro.

By searching the sequence databases with a rat Ampk-beta-1 cDNA,
Stapleton et al. (1997) identified an EST encoding human AMPK-beta-1.
The human and rat AMPK-beta-1 proteins have 95% amino acid sequence
identity. Thornton et al. (1998) reported that the predicted 271-amino
acid human AMPK-beta-1 protein shares 71% sequence identity with human
AMPK-beta-2 (PRKAB2; 602741). They found that both beta isoforms form
complexes with Ampk-alpha-1 (PRKAA1) and Ampk-alpha-2 (PRKAA2; 600497)
in rat liver and skeletal muscle. Coexpression of the alpha and
AMPK-gamma-1 (PRKAG1; 602742) subunits with either AMPK-beta-1 or
AMPK-beta-2 in mammalian cells did not reveal a significant difference
in AMPK activity between the 2 beta isoforms. Using Western blot
analysis and immunoprecipitation studies, Thornton et al. (1998)
determined that Ampk-beta-1 was expressed at higher levels than
Ampk-beta-2 in rat liver, while Ampk-beta-2 was more abundant in
skeletal muscle. They suggested that the marked difference in expression
patterns of Ampk-beta-1 and Ampk-beta-2 indicates tissue-specific roles
for these isoforms. By Northern blot analysis, Thornton et al. (1998)
found that AMPK-beta-1 was expressed as a 3-kb mRNA in all tissues
tested.

GENE FUNCTION

Minokoshi et al. (2004) investigated the potential role of AMP-activated
protein kinase (AMPK) in the hypothalamus in the regulation of food
intake. Minokoshi et al. (2004) reported that AMPK activity is inhibited
in arcuate and paraventricular hypothalamus by the anorexigenic hormone
leptin (164160), and in multiple hypothalamic regions by insulin
(176730), high glucose, and refeeding. A melanocortin receptor (see
155555) agonist, a potent anorexigen, decreased AMPK activity in
paraventricular hypothalamus, whereas agouti-related protein (602311),
an orexigen, increased AMPK activity. Melanocortin receptor signaling is
required for leptin and refeeding effects of AMPK in the paraventricular
hypothalamus. Dominant-negative AMPK expression in the hypothalamus was
sufficient to reduce food intake and body weight, whereas constitutively
active AMPK increased both. Alterations of hypothalamic AMPK activity
augmented changes in arcuate neuropeptide expression induced by fasting
and feeding. Furthermore, inhibition of hypothalamic AMPK is necessary
for leptin's effects on food intake and body weight, as constitutively
active AMPK blocks these effects. Thus, Minokoshi et al. (2004)
concluded that hypothalamic AMPK plays a critical role in hormonal and
nutrient-derived anorexigenic and orexigenic signals and in energy
balance.

Baba et al. (2006) showed that FNIP1 (610594) interacted with the alpha,
beta, and gamma subunits of AMPK. FNIP1 was phosphorylated by AMPK, and
its phosphorylation was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by an AMPK
inhibitor, resulting in reduced FNIP1 expression. FLCN (607273)
phosphorylation was diminished by rapamycin and amino acid starvation
and facilitated by FNIP1 overexpression, suggesting that FLCN
phosphorylation may be regulated by mTOR (FRAP1; 601231) and AMPK
signaling. Baba et al. (2006) concluded that FLCN and FNIP1 may be
involved in energy and/or nutrient sensing through the AMPK and mTOR
signaling pathways.

MAPPING

Stapleton et al. (1997) mapped the human AMPK-beta-1 gene to 12q24.1 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Xiao et al. (2007) reported the crystal structure of the regulatory
fragment of mammalian AMPK in complexes with AMP and ATP. The phosphate
groups of AMP/ATP lie in a groove on the surface of the gamma domain,
which is lined with basic residues, many of which are associated with
disease-causing mutations. Structural and solution studies revealed that
2 sites on the gamma domain bind either AMP or magnesium ATP, whereas a
third site contains a tightly bound AMP that does not exchange. Xiao et
al. (2007) stated that their binding studies indicated that under
physiologic conditions AMPK mainly exists in its inactive form in
complex with magnesium ATP, which is much more abundant than AMP. Their
modeling studies suggested how changes in the concentration of AMP
enhance AMPK activity levels. The structure also suggested a mechanism
for propagating AMP/ATP signaling whereby a phosphorylated residue from
the alpha and/or beta subunits binds to the gamma subunit in the
presence of AMP but not when ATP is bound.

614121	TITLE *614121 POLY(A) POLYMERASE-ASSOCIATED DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 4; PAPD4
;;GLD2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

PAPD4 is a poly(A) polymerase (PAP; EC 2.7.7.19). Gld2, the C. elegans
ortholog of PAPD4, functions as a cytoplasmic PAP that regulates stem
cell fate and is required for stem cells to complete meiosis (Kwak et
al., 2004).

CLONING

By searching a human database for sequences similar to C. elegans Gld2,
followed by PCR of a human breast cancer cell line, Kwak et al. (2004)
cloned PAPD4, which they called GLD2. The deduced 484-amino acid protein
contains a catalytic domain within a central domain that shares higher
similarity with C. elegans cytosolic Gld2 than with canonic nuclear PAP
(PAPOLA; 605553). Kwak et al. (2004) also cloned mouse Gld2, which
encodes a deduced 484-amino acid protein that shares 93% identity with
human GLD2.

GENE FUNCTION

Kwak et al. (2004) stated that C. elegans Gld2 has little PAP activity
until it is directed to RNA via interaction with Gld3, an RNA-binding
protein. They showed that Gld2 tethered to RNA via Ms2, a nonnative
RNA-binding protein, efficiently catalyzed polyadenylation of reporter
mRNA. Similarly, mouse and human GLD2 catalyzed polyadenylation of
reporter mRNA to which they were tethered.

MAPPING

Hartz (2011) mapped the PAPD4 gene to chromosome 5q14.1 based on an
alignment of the PAPD4 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK095818) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

608398	TITLE *608398 CUB AND SUSHI MULTIPLE DOMAINS 2; CSMD2
;;KIAA1884
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2001) cloned CSMD2, which they designated
KIAA1884. The CSMD2 transcript contains an Alu repeat in the 3-prime
untranslated region. RT-PCR detected intermediate expression in fetal
brain, adult brain, spinal cord, and all specific adult brain regions
examined. Lower levels were detected in spleen, lung, and testis, and
little to no expression was detected in the other tissues examined.

By screening databases using the partial KIAA1884 clone obtained by
Nagase et al. (2001), followed by RT-PCR of a fetal brain cDNA library
and 5-prime RACE, Lau and Scholnick (2003) cloned full-length CSMD2. The
deduced 3,487-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of
about 380 kD. Like CSMD1 (608397), CSMD2 contains 14 alternating CUB and
sushi domains, followed by 12 additional tandem sushi domains (CSMD1 has
14), a single transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic tail that
contains putative phosphorylation sites. Unlike CSMD1 and CSMD3
(608399), CSMD2 does not have a signal peptide.

GENE FUNCTION

Lau and Scholnick (2003) detected expression of CSMD2 at levels greater
than expected in 5 of 18 squamous cell carcinoma cell lines.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lau and Scholnick (2003) determined that the CSMD2 gene contains 70
exons and spans about 651 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis using 2 genomic databases, Lau and
Scholnick (2003) determined that the CSMD2 gene maps to chromosome
1p34.3 or chromosome 1p35.3.

605995	TITLE *605995 KINESIN FAMILY MEMBER 1B; KIF1B
;;KIAA0591
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Nangaku et al. (1994) cloned a member of the mouse kinesin superfamily,
Kif1b, which encodes an N-terminal-type motor protein. Kif1b was
expressed in all tissues tested. In situ hybridization revealed that
Kif1b was expressed abundantly in differentiated nerve cells.

Zhao et al. (2001) identified an isoform of mouse Kif1b, which they
called Kif1b-beta, that is distinct from Kif1b-alpha (Nangaku et al.,
1994) in its cargo-binding domain.

Yang et al. (2001) identified the KIF1B gene in a homozygously deleted
region of chromosome 1p36.2 in a neuroblastoma cell line. They reported
results suggesting that the gene is not a candidate for tumor suppressor
gene of neuroblastoma. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that human
KIF1B has at least 2 isoforms. The long isoform (KIF1B-beta) was
expressed in a wide variety of tissues, while the short isoform
(KIF1B-alpha) was detected only in adult testis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Schlisio et al. (2008) stated that the KIF1B gene contains 46 coding
exons.

MAPPING

By STS analysis, Gong et al. (1996) mapped the human KIF1B gene to
chromosome 1p36. They mapped the mouse Kif1b gene to chromosome 4.

Zuchner et al. (2004) stated that the KIF1B gene maps to chromosome
1p36.2, about 1.65 Mb telomeric to the MFN2 gene (608507), which is
mutant in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease-2A2 (CMT2A2; 609260).

NOMENCLATURE

Lawrence et al. (2004) presented a standardized kinesin nomenclature
based on 14 family designations. Under this system, KIF1B belongs to the
kinesin-3 family.

GENE FUNCTION

Nangaku et al. (1994) found that mouse Kif1b works as a monomer, having
a microtubule plus-end-directed motility. Rotary shadowing electron
microscopy revealed mostly single globular structures.
Immunocytochemically, Kif1b was colocalized with mitochondria in vivo. A
subcellular fractionation study showed that Kif1b was concentrated in
the mitochondrial fraction, and purified Kif1b could transport
mitochondria along microtubules in vitro. These data suggested that
Kif1b works as a monomeric motor for anterograde transport of
mitochondria.

Schlisio et al. (2008) found that apoptosis caused by NGF (see NGFB;
162030) withdrawal from cultured neuronal cells was mediated by EGLN3
(606426) and its downstream effector, KIF1B-beta.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease 2A1

In all affected members of a family with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease-2A1
(CMT2A1; 118210), Zhao et al. (2001) identified a loss-of-function
mutation in the KIF1B gene (605995.0001).

- Role in Cancer

In 1 medulloblastoma (155255), 3 neuroblastomas (NBLST1; 256700), and 2
pheochromocytoma (171300) tumor samples, Schlisio et al. (2008)
identified 6 different missense mutations in the KIF1B gene. In 3 tumors
there was loss of the wildtype allele and in 3 there was retention,
including 1 in which there was low-level amplification of the mutant
allele. In the 4 cases in which corresponding germline DNA samples from
the respective patients were available, the mutations were also present
(605995.0002-605995.0005). Functional studies in primary rat sympathetic
neurons revealed that induction of apoptosis was impaired with all of
the KIF1B variants compared to wildtype.

ANIMAL MODEL

Zhao et al. (2001) generated Kif1b knockout mice by gene targeting.
Kif1b knockout mice died at birth from apnea due to nervous system
defects. Death of knockout neurons in culture could be rescued by
expression of the Kif1b-beta isoform. The Kif1b heterozygotes had a
defect in transporting synaptic vesicle precursors and suffered from
progressive muscle weakness similar to human neuropathies.

Lyons et al. (2009) identified a mutation in the zebrafish Kif1b gene
that disrupted localization of Mbp (159430) mRNA in the central nervous
system (CNS) and outgrowth of the posterior lateral line nerve in the
peripheral nervous system (PNS). Using antisense morpholino
oligonucleotides to block translation of individual Kif1b isoforms, they
found that the phenotype was due to loss of Kif1b-beta rather than
Kif1b-alpha, even though the mutation occurred in the common region
shared by both isoforms. Examination of the zebrafish mutants revealed
that Kif1b was required to localize myelin mRNA to oligodendrocyte
processes, to elaborate the correct amount of myelin around axons, and
to prevent ectopic production of myelin-like membrane. Normal Kif1b
function was also required for development of certain axons in the CNS
and PNS.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, AXONAL, TYPE 2A1
KIF1B, GLN98LEU

In all affected individuals of a Japanese family (family 694) with
autosomal dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2A1 (CMT2A1; 118210)
reported by Saito et al. (1997), Zhao et al. (2001) identified an A-to-T
transversion in the KIF1B gene, resulting in a gln98-to-leu (Q98L)
substitution. The Q98L mutation was not identified in 95 healthy,
unrelated Japanese controls. The mutation occurred in the middle of the
P loop, the consensus ATP-binding site, and was predicted to disrupt the
function of this mechanochemical enzyme. Zhao et al. (2001) tested the
motor activity of recombinant mouse Kif1b with the Q98L mutation. The
microtubule-activated ATP turnover rates were reduced in the mutant
protein. Furthermore, the Q98L mutant protein remained and aggregated in
the perinuclear region, while the wildtype Kif1b protein accumulated at
the cell periphery. These data suggested that the Q98L mutation resulted
in a functional loss of motor activity.

KIF1B, GLU656VAL

In a neuroblastoma (256700) tumor sample and in germline DNA from the
corresponding patient, Schlisio et al. (2008) identified an A-T
transversion in exon 20 of the KIF1B gene, resulting in a glu646-to-val
(E646V) substitution. There was loss of the wildtype allele in the tumor
sample, and MYCN (164840) amplification was present.

In a neuroblastoma (256700) tumor sample and in germline DNA from the
corresponding patient, Schlisio et al. (2008) identified a C-T
transition in exon 24 of the KIF1B gene, resulting in a thr827-to-ile
(T827I) substitution. The wildtype allele was retained in the tumor
sample; no amplification of MYCN (164840) was present, but low-level
(2-fold) amplification of the mutant allele was detected.

In a neuroblastoma (256700) tumor sample and in germline DNA from the
corresponding patient, Schlisio et al. (2008) identified a C-T
transition in exon 33 of the KIF1B gene, resulting in a pro1217-to-ser
(P1217S) substitution. There was loss of the wildtype allele in the
tumor sample, and no MYCN (164840) amplification was present.

PHEOCHROMOCYTOMA
NEUROBLASTOMA, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, 1, INCLUDED
KIF1B, SER1481ASN

In a pheochromocytoma (171300) tumor sample and in germline DNA from the
corresponding patient, Schlisio et al. (2008) identified a 4442G-A
transition in exon 41 of the KIF1B gene, resulting in a ser1481-to-asn
(S1481N) substitution. The wildtype allele was retained in the tumor
sample. The proband was a 28-year-old female who presented at 17 months
of age with a neuroblastoma (256700) and in adulthood developed a mature
ganglioneuroma and bilateral pheochromocytoma. Her paternal grandfather
harbored the mutant S1481N allele and also developed bilateral
pheochromocytoma. In vitro functional expression studies showed that the
mutant protein was deficient in the ability to induce apoptosis of
sympathetic precursor cells in response to growth factor withdrawal
compared to wildtype KIF1B.

Yeh et al. (2008) reported further analysis of the family reported by
Schlisio et al. (2008). The proband developed a leiomyosarcoma, and her
father, who also carried the S1481N mutation, developed adenocarcinoma
of the lung (211980). Analysis of tumor tissue revealed that all 4
neural crest tumors and the leiomyosarcoma retained both KIF1B alleles
and showed no loss of heterozygosity (LOH), consistent with a
haploinsufficiency mechanism. Yeh et al. (2008) postulated that the
leiomyosarcoma may have evolved secondary to the proband's childhood
treatment for neuroblastoma. In contrast, about 45% of cells from the
lung tumor showed LOH at this locus, suggesting a possible role for gene
dosage in development of this nonneural tumor.

608507	TITLE *608507 MITOFUSIN 2; MFN2
;;KIAA0214
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The size and arrangement of mitochondria differs with cell type,
physiologic condition, and pathologic state. Mitofusins, such as MFN2,
mediate the fusion of mitochondria and thereby contribute to the dynamic
balance between fusion and fission that determines mitochondria
morphology (Santel and Fuller, 2001).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated immature myeloid
cell line cDNA library, Nagase et al. (1996) cloned MFN2, which they
designated KIAA0214. The deduced 757-amino acid protein contains an
ATP/GTP-binding site motif. Northern blot analysis detected expression
of MFN2 in all tissues and cell lines examined, with highest expression
in heart and skeletal muscle.

By searching EST databases, Santel and Fuller (2001) found that KIAA0214
showed significant similarity to the Drosophila mitochondria fusion
gene, Fzo, and they further characterized the cDNA clone. The deduced
757-amino acid protein contains an N-terminal GTPase domain and a
transmembrane domain near the C terminus. MFN2 shares 60% identity with
MFN1 (608506), with the most extensive homology in the GTPase domains.
The N- and C-terminal ends are more variable. When stably expressed in
COS-7 cells, MFN2 colocalized with mitochondrial markers. An internal
region, including the predicted bipartite transmembrane domain, was
sufficient to target MFN2 to mitochondria.

Bach et al. (2003) cloned rat Mfn2, which shares 95% identity to human
MFN2. Northern blot analysis of human tissues detected a 4.7-kb
transcript expressed at high levels in skeletal muscle and heart, and at
lower levels in brain, kidney, and liver. Little to no expression was
detected in other tissues. Very little Mfn2 was expressed in a rat
myoblast cell line, but expression was induced following differentiation
into myotubes. Western blot analysis detected rat Mfn2 at an apparent
molecular mass of 110 kD in heart, skeletal muscle, brown adipose
tissue, and kidney. Endogenous Mfn2 was enriched in mitochondrial
fractions of these tissues.

GENE STRUCTURE

Casasnovas et al. (2010) noted that the MFN2 gene contains 19 exons.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis and by examining a human-rodent hybrid
panel, Nagase et al. (1996) mapped the MFN2 gene to chromosome 1.

Zuchner et al. (2004) stated that the MFN2 gene maps to chromosome
1p36.2, about 1.65 Mb centromeric to the KIF1B gene (605995), which is
mutant in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease-2A1 (CMT2A1; 118210).

GENE FUNCTION

Santel and Fuller (2001) found that overexpression of MFN2 caused
perinuclear mitochondrial clustering. Mutation analysis revealed that
the C-terminal coiled-coil domain mediated mitochondrial clustering, and
the GTPase domain mediated mitochondrial fusion. Furthermore, a
GTPase-dead DRP1 (603850) caused similar mitochondrial clustering in
transfected COS-7 cells, and COS-7 cells cotransfected with the
GTPase-dead DRP1 and MFN2 developed mitochondrial filaments and networks
that extended from the perinuclear mitochondrial cluster toward the cell
periphery. Santel and Fuller (2001) concluded that the size and
morphologic arrangement of mitochondria are due to a dynamic balance
between MFN-dependent mitochondrial fusion and DRP1-dependent
mitochondrial fission.

Bach et al. (2003) found that the induction of Mfn2 during
differentiation in a rat myogenic cell line into myotubes paralleled the
development of an extensive mitochondrial network. Overexpression of
Mfn2 collapsed the network and mitochondria clustered around the
nucleus. Knock-down of Mfn2 expression in muscle cells with mouse Mfn2
antisense sequence led to fragmentation of the mitochondrial network
into independent clusters and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential.
Reduced Mfn2 expression in rat myotubes and mouse fibroblasts was
associated with a 30% reduction of glucose oxidation. Repression of Mfn2
expression also reduced mitochondrial membrane potential and cell
respiration, and reduced mitochondrial proton leak. Bach et al. (2003)
further found that Mfn2 expression was repressed in obesity, being
reduced by 34% in muscle from obese rats, and reduced by 36% in muscle
of obese human subjects. Expression in mitochondrial fractions was 39%
lower in obese rats, and 43% lower in obese humans in comparison with
lean controls. Bach et al. (2003) concluded that MFN2 expression is
crucial in mitochondrial metabolism through the maintenance of the
mitochondrial network architecture, and reduced MFN2 expression may
explain some of the metabolic alterations associated with obesity.

Pich et al. (2005) showed that Mfn2 loss of function inhibited pyruvate,
glucose, and fatty acid oxidation and reduced mitochondrial membrane
potential, whereas Mfn2 gain of function increased glucose oxidation and
mitochondrial membrane potential. Mfn2 loss of function repressed
nuclear-encoded subunits of OXPHOS complexes I, II, III and V, whereas
Mfn2 overexpression induced the subunits of complexes I, IV, and V.
Obesity-induced Mfn2 deficiency in rat skeletal muscle was also
associated with a decrease in the subunits of complexes I, II, III, and
V. In addition, the effect of Mfn2 overexpression on mitochondrial
metabolism was mimicked by a truncated Mfn2 mutant that was inactive as
a mitochondrial fusion protein. Pich et al. (2005) concluded that Mfn2
triggers mitochondrial energization, at least in part, by regulating
OXPHOS expression through signals that are independent of its role as a
mitochondrial fusion protein.

Two members of the BCL2 family, BAX (600040) and BAK (600516), change
intracellular location early in the promotion of apoptosis to
concentrate in focal clusters at sites of mitochondrial division.
Karbowski et al. (2006) reported that in healthy cells, BAX or BAK is
required for normal fusion of mitochondria into elongated tubules. BAX
seems to induce mitochondrial fusion by activating assembly of the large
GTPase MFN2 and changing its submitochondrial distribution and membrane
mobility--properties that correlate with different GTP-bound states of
MFN2. Karbowski et al. (2006) concluded that BAX and BAK regulate
mitochondrial dynamics in healthy cells and that BCL2 family members may
also regulate apoptosis through organelle morphogenesis machineries.

Guo et al. (2007) found that a variety of apoptotic stimuli induced
expression of Mfn2 in rat vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs).
Overexpression of Mfn2 triggered apoptosis of VSMCs in culture and in
balloon-injured rat carotid arteries, which helped prevent neointima
formation after angioplasty. Conversely, Mfn2 silencing protected VSMCs
against H2O2- or Mfn2 overexpression-induced apoptosis. The proapoptotic
effect of Mfn2 was independent of its role in mitochondrial fusion and
was mediated by inhibition of Akt (see AKT1; 164730) signaling,
resulting in activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway.
Mfn2-induced apoptosis was blocked by overexpression of an active
phosphoinositide 3-kinase (see PIK3CG; 601232) mutant or inhibition of
Bclxl (600039) or caspase-9 (CASP9; 602234). Guo et al. (2007) concluded
that, in addition to its antiproliferative effects, MFN2 is a primary
determinant of VSMC apoptosis.

De Brito and Scorrano (2008) showed that MFN2 is enriched at the
endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-mitochondria interface. Ablation or silencing
of Mfn2 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and HeLa cells disrupted ER
morphology and loosened ER-mitochondria interactions, thereby reducing
the efficiency of mitochondrial calcium uptake in response to stimuli
that generate inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate. An in vitro assay as well as
genetic and biochemical evidences supported a model in which Mfn2 on the
ER bridges the 2 organelles by engaging in homotypic and heterotypic
complexes with Mfn1 (608506) or Mfn2 on the surface of mitochondria.
Thus, de Brito and Scorrano (2008) concluded that Mfn2 tethers ER to
mitochondria, a juxtaposition required for efficient mitochondrial
calcium uptake.

Chen and Dorn (2013) demonstrated that the mitochondrial outer membrane
guanosine triphosphatase MFN2 mediates parkin (602544) recruitment to
damaged mitochondria. Parkin bound to MFN2 in a PINK1 (608309)-dependent
manner; PINK1 phosphorylated MFN2 and promoted its parkin-mediated
ubiquitination. Ablation of Mfn2 in mouse cardiac myocytes prevented
depolarization-induced translocation of parkin to the mitochondria and
suppressed mitophagy. Accumulation of morphologically and functionally
abnormal mitochondria induced respiratory dysfunction in Mfn2-deficient
mouse embryonic fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes and in parkin-deficient
Drosophila heart tubes, causing dilated cardiomyopathy. Thus, Chen and
Dorn (2013) concluded that MFN2 functions as a mitochondrial receptor
for parkin and is required for quality control of cardiac mitochondria.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of several families with Charcot-Marie-Tooth
disease-2A2 (CMT2A2; 609260), Zuchner et al. (2004) identified mutations
in the MFN2 gene (608507.0001-608507.0006).

Kijima et al. (2005) studied the MFN2 gene in 81 Japanese patients with
axonal or unclassified CMT and detected 7 mutations in 7 unrelated
patients. Six mutations were novel, and 1 was a de novo mutation. Most
mutations were located within or immediately upstream of the GTPase
domain or within 2 coiled-coil domains critical for mitochondrial
targeting of MFN2. Kijima et al. (2005) stated that formation of the
mitochondrial network would be required to maintain the functional
peripheral nerve axon.

In affected members of 6 unrelated families with hereditary motor and
sensory neuropathy with optic atrophy (HMSN6; 601152), Zuchner et al.
(2006) identified 6 different heterozygous mutations in the MFN2 gene
(see, e.g., 608507.0009-608607.0012).

Chung et al. (2006) identified 10 pathogenic MFN2 mutations (see, e.g.,
608507.0004; 608507.0009; 608507.0011) in 26 patients from 15 (24.2%) of
62 Korean families with CMT2A2 or HMSN VI. There were 2 main groups of
patients, including those with early onset before 10 years and those
with late onset after age 10 years. Those with early onset had a severe
disorder, often with scoliosis and contractures, whereas those with
later onset had a milder disorder and a higher frequency of unusual
findings such as tremor, pain, and hearing loss. The severity of the
disorder tended to be the same within families, suggesting a
genotype/phenotype correlation.

In fibroblasts derived from CMT2A2 patients with MFN2 mutations (see,
e.g., R94Q, 608507.0001), Guillet et al. (2010) found an uncoupling of
mitochondrial oxygen consumption and decreased efficiency of oxygen
utilization, but normal ATP production. Normal ATP production was
maintained by an increased respiration rate, mainly involving complex II
proteins. Mutant fibroblasts also showed overexpression and increased
activity of ANT3 (SLC25A6; 300151), which was believed to result in
reduced efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation. The findings suggested
that MFN2 plays a role in controlling ATP/ADP exchange in mitochondria.

Calvo et al. (2009) identified 20 different missense mutations,
including 10 novel mutations, in the MFN2 gene in 20 of 150 probands
with CMT and a nerve conduction velocity (NCV) of 25 m/s or greater.
Eighteen of the patients had been previously reported. The mutation
frequency in CMT2 was 17.8% (19 of 107 patients) and in CMT1 was 2.3% (1
of 43). Four patients had proven de novo mutations, 8 families had
autosomal dominant inheritance, and 3 had autosomal recessive
inheritance; the remaining 5 patients were sporadic cases with
heterozygous mutations. The phenotypes varied from mild forms to
early-onset severe forms, and additional features, such as pyramidal
signs or vasomotor dysfunction, were encountered in 8 patients (32%).
The study indicated that MFN2 mutations are a frequent cause of CMT2,
with variable severity and either dominant or recessive inheritance.
Calvo et al. (2009) suggested that testing for mutations in MFN2 showed
be a first-line analysis in axonal CMT regardless of the mode of
inheritance or the severity of the peripheral neuropathy.

Casasnovas et al. (2010) identified 9 different heterozygous MFN2
mutations, including 4 novel mutations, in 24 patients from 14 different
Spanish families with CMT2A2. Six (42.8%) of 14 families carried the
same mutation (R468H; 608507.0015). Overall, MFN2 mutations were
identified in 16% of the total cohort of 85 Spanish families with axonal
CMT, and Casasnovas et al. (2010) concluded that MFN2 is the most
frequent cause of axonal CMT in this population.

ANIMAL MODEL

Chen et al. (2003) found that both Mfn1- and Mfn2-deficient mice died in
midgestation. Whereas Mfn2 mutant embryos showed disruption of the
placental trophoblast giant cell layer, Mfn1-deficient giant cells were
normal. Embryonic fibroblasts lacking Mfn displayed fragmented
mitochondria due to severe reduction in mitochondrial fusion. Mfn1 and
Mfn2 formed homotypic and heterotypic complexes, and rescue of mutant
cells indicated that the homotypic complexes were functional for fusion.
A subset of mitochondria in mutant cells also lost membrane potential.
The authors concluded that Mfn1 and Mfn2 have both redundant and
distinct functions and act in 3 separate molecular complexes to promote
mitochondrial fusion.

Detmer et al. (2008) generated transgenic mice expressing a pathogenic
Mfn2 T105M mutation in peripheral motor neurons. Mutant mice developed
key clinical features of CMT2A in a dose-dependent manner. Homozygous
mice had a severe gait defect from birth due to an inability to
dorsiflex the hindpaws, and they consequently dragged their hindpaws
while walking and supported themselves on the hind knuckles, rather than
the soles. Anterior calf muscles showed severe atrophy. There was
decreased penetrance of the defects as well as lack of progression.
Histologic studies showed reduced numbers of motor axons in the motor
roots and improper mitochondrial distribution with tight clusters of
mitochondria within axons. Homozygous mice had drastically short tails
that were deformed, whereas heterozygous mice had shorter tails with
mild to moderate bony kinks or thickening.

Fyfe et al. (2011) used genomewide linkage analysis followed by
candidate gene sequencing to identify a homozygous 3-bp deletion in the
canine Mfn2 gene as causative of a severe autosomal recessive form of
fetal-onset neuroaxonal dystrophy. The in-frame 3-bp deletion was
predicted to result in the deletion of a conserved glu539 residue.
Mutant mRNA was expressed, but mutant protein was nearly undetectable on
Western blot analysis of dog tissues. Immunohistochemical studies of
normal pup brainstem showed robust granular cytoplasmic staining of Mfn2
in cerebellar Purkinje cells, deep cerebellar nuclei, and most large
neurons in identified nuclei. The phenotype was characterized by death
at birth due to respiratory failure. Affected fetuses had swollen
axons/spheroids throughout the extrapyramidal motor system of the
brainstem, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves, as well as cerebellar
hypoplasia. Axonal swelling was composed of membrane-bound fragments of
variably degenerated mitochondria and other tubulofilamentous material.
The phenotype was reminiscent of human neuroaxonal dystrophy (256600)
caused by mutation in the PLA2G6 gene (603604); however, brain iron
accumulation was not observed in canines with the Mfn2 mutation.

MFN2, ARG94GLN

In affected members of a Japanese kindred (family 693) with
Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease-2A2 (CMT2A2; 609260) originally reported by
Saito et al. (1997) and a Russian kindred with CMT2A2, Zuchner et al.
(2004) identified a 281G-A transition in the MFN2 gene, resulting in an
arg94-to-gln (R94Q) substitution in the predicted beginning of the
GTPase domain of the protein. Age at disease onset in the 2 kindreds
ranged from 3 to 17 years. A different mutation affecting the same codon
(R94W; 608507.0009) was identified in another patient.

Casasnovas et al. (2010) identified a heterozygous R94Q mutation in
affected members of a Spanish family with early-onset severe CMT2A2 and
optic atrophy.

Zuchner et al. (2004) identified a 2219G-C transversion in the MFN2
gene, resulting in a trp740-to-ser (W740S) substitution. Age at disease
onset ranged from 5 to 52 years.

CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, AXONAL, TYPE 2A2
MFN2, LEU76PRO

In affected members of a family with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease-2A2
(CMT2A2; 609260) originally reported by Pericak-Vance et al. (1997),
Zuchner et al. (2004) identified a 227T-C transition in the MFN2 gene,
resulting in a leu76-to-pro (L76P) substitution. Age at disease onset
ranged from 7 to 44 years.

.0004
CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, AXONAL, TYPE 2A2
MFN2, ARG280HIS

In affected members of a family with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease-2A2
(CMT2A2; 609260) originally reported by Pericak-Vance et al. (1997),
Zuchner et al. (2004) identified an 839G-A transition in the MFN2 gene,
resulting in an arg280-to-his (R280H) substitution. Age at disease onset
ranged from 11 to 35 years.

Chung et al. (2006) reported a large multigenerational Korean family
with late-onset CMT2A2 carrying a heterozygous R280H mutation. Onset
ranged between 11 and 42 years, and affected individuals had mild muscle
weakness and atrophy. Associated but variable features included pain,
tremor, dysarthria, extensor plantar responses, and migraine. One
patient had sensorineural hearing loss.

.0005
CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, AXONAL, TYPE 2A2
MFN2, PRO251ALA

In affected members of an Italian family with Charcot-Marie-Tooth
disease-2A2 (CMT2A2; 609260) originally reported by Muglia et al.
(2001), Zuchner et al. (2004) identified a 751C-G transversion in the
MFN2 gene, resulting in a pro251-to-ala (P251A) substitution. Age at
disease onset ranged from 8 to 50 years.

.0006
CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, AXONAL, TYPE 2A2
MFN2, VAL69PHE

In affected members of a Turkish family with Charcot-Marie-Tooth
disease-2A2 (CMT2A2; 609260), Zuchner et al. (2004) identified a 205G-T
transversion in the MFN2 gene, resulting in a val69-to-phe (V69F)
substitution. Age at disease onset ranged from 5 to 15 years. The family
had previously been reported by Bissar-Tadmouri et al. (2004).

.0007
CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, AXONAL, TYPE 2A2
MFN2, LYS357ASN

In a Japanese patient with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease-2A2 (CMT2A2;
609260), Kijima et al. (2005) identified an apparently de novo missense
mutation, lys357 to asn (K357N), resulting from a G-to-C transversion at
nucleotide 1071 of the MFN2 gene.

.0008
CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, AXONAL, TYPE 2A2
MFN2, HIS165ASP

In 11 affected members of a family with CMT2A2 (609260), Zhu et al.
(2005) identified a heterozygous 493C-G transversion in exon 6 of the
MFN2 gene, resulting in a his165-to-asp (H165D) substitution in the
conserved GTPase domain. The family was previously reported by Vucic et
al. (2003) as having CMT with pyramidal features.

.0009
CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, AXONAL, TYPE 2A2
HEREDITARY MOTOR AND SENSORY NEUROPATHY VI, INCLUDED
MFN2, ARG94TRP

In a patient with early-onset CMT2A2 (609260), Zuchner et al. (2004)
identified a heterozygous 280C-T transition in exon 4 of the MFN2 gene,
resulting in an arg94-to-trp (R94W) substitution. A different mutation
affecting the same codon (R94Q; 608507.0001) was identified in another
family.

Zuchner et al. (2006) identified a heterozygous R94W mutation in an
African American mother and daughter with hereditary motor and sensory
neuropathy with optic atrophy (HMSN6; 601152). Both patients had early
onset of axonal neuropathy, at ages 8 and 3 years, respectively, and
late onset of optic atrophy, at ages 50 and 40 years, respectively.

Chung et al. (2006) identified a heterozygous R94W mutation in 2 Korean
families with severe early-onset CMT2A2 and no evidence of optic
atrophy.

.0010
HEREDITARY MOTOR AND SENSORY NEUROPATHY VI
MFN2, GLN276ARG

In a woman with HMSN VI (601152), Zuchner et al. (2006) identified a
heterozygous 827A-G transition in exon 9 of the MFN2 gene, resulting in
a gln276-to-arg (Q276R) substitution. The patient's mother and sister
both carried the mutation, but only had peripheral neuropathy without
optic atrophy. Zuchner et al. (2006) suggested incomplete penetrance.

.0011
HEREDITARY MOTOR AND SENSORY NEUROPATHY VI
CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, AXONAL, TYPE 2A2, INCLUDED
MFN2, ARG364TRP

In a father and 2 sons with HMSN VI (601152), Zuchner et al. (2006)
identified a heterozygous 1090C-T transition in exon 11 of the MFN2
gene, resulting in an arg364-to-trp (R364W) substitution. All patients
had a severe form of the disorder with neuropathy developing by age 1
year and optic atrophy by age 10 years.

Chung et al. (2006) reported 4 unrelated Korean families with
early-onset neuropathy before 10 years of age and a heterozygous R364W
mutation. In 1 family, only 1 of 3 mutation carriers had optic atrophy.
In another family, both mutation carriers had optic atrophy. Optic
atrophy was not present in the remaining 2 families, more consistent
with a diagnosis of CMT2A2 (609260). All except 1 patient had scoliosis
and most had contractures.

.0012
HEREDITARY MOTOR AND SENSORY NEUROPATHY VI
MFN2, THR206ILE

In a father and son with HMSN VI (601152), Zuchner et al. (2006)
identified a heterozygous 617C-T transition in exon 7 of the MFN2 gene,
resulting in a thr206-to-ile (T206I) substitution.

.0013
CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, AXONAL, TYPE 2A2
MFN2, ARG707TRP

In a woman with early-onset severe axonal neuropathy (609260), Nicholson
et al. (2008) identified a homozygous 2119C-T transition in the MFN2
gene, resulting in an arg707-to-trp (R707W) substitution in a highly
conserved residue. Each parent was heterozygous for the mutation and
showed a mild form of peripheral neuropathy. Nicholson et al. (2008)
noted that the apparent autosomal recessive inheritance of the disorder
in this family was actually semidominant and that the parents showed
incomplete penetrance. The homozygous mutation in the daughter resulted
from the combined effect of 2 mutations and a more severe phenotype with
earlier onset.

.0014
HEREDITARY MOTOR AND SENSORY NEUROPATHY VI
CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, AXONAL, TYPE 2A2, INCLUDED
MFN2, ARG104TRP

In an Italian father and 2 sons with peripheral neuropathy, Del Bo et
al. (2008) identified a heterozygous 310C-T transition in exon 4 of the
MFN2 gene, resulting in an arg104-to-trp (R104W) substitution in a
highly conserved residue in the GTPase domain. The phenotype was highly
variable within the family. The father had a symmetric axonal
predominantly motor polyneuropathy, spastic gait, and pes cavus,
consistent with CMT2A2 (609260), as well as impaired nocturnal vision
and sensorineural hearing loss, consistent with HMSN6 (601152). He also
showed cognitive decline first noted in his forties. Both sons had
delayed motor and language development, decreased IQ, steppage gait,
distal muscle weakness and atrophy, and axonal sensorimotor neuropathy
at ages 10 and 7 years, respectively. One son also had optic nerve
dysfunction. MR spectroscopy (MRS) in the father suggested a defect in
mitochondrial energy metabolism in the occipital cortex. Del Bo et al.
(2008) suggested that central nervous system involvement and cognitive
impairment may be other phenotypic features of MFN2 mutations.

.0015
CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, AXONAL, TYPE 2A2
MFN2, ARG468HIS

Casasnovas et al. (2010) identified a heterozygous 1403G-A transition in
exon 14 of the MFN2 gene, resulting in an arg468-to-his (R468H)
substitution, in affected members of 6 (42.8%) of 14 unrelated Spanish
families with autosomal dominant CMT2A2 (609260). All patients with the
R468H mutation had either mild or moderate disease that presented late
in adult life in the third to fifth decade. Fibroblasts from 1 patient
with the R468H mutation showed a mitochondrial coupling defect, a 50%
decrease in ATP production, and an increase of the respiration rate
linked to complex II.

.0016
CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, AXONAL, TYPE 2A2
MFN2, IVS13DS, T-C, +2

In 3 sibs with a severe form of adult-onset CMT2A2 (608260) who all
developed a fatal subacute encephalopathy, Boaretto et al. (2010)
identified a heterozygous T-to-C transition (1392+2T-C) in intron 13 of
the MFN2 gene. Their father had died at age 61 of a similar disorder.
The mutation was not found in 200 control chromosomes, but was present
in an unaffected 64-year-old sister, indicating incomplete penetrance.
RT-PCR analysis showed that the splice site mutation resulted in 4
aberrant MFN2 transcripts and completely abolished correct splicing of
exon 13. There were different splicing patterns in the cell lines,
suggesting that activation of cryptic splice sites may be under control
of tissue-specific factors. Boaretto et al. (2010) noted the unusual
encephalopathy present in this family, and suggested that the nature of
the mutation may have put sensitive areas of the brain in a precarious
energetic equilibrium. However, unknown genetic, epigenetic factors, or
environmental factors likely played a role in the phenotype.

.0017
CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, AXONAL, TYPE 2A2, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
MFN2, PHE216SER

In 2 British sibs with autosomal recessive inheritance of severe
early-onset CMT2A2 (609260), Polke et al. (2011) identified compound
heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the MFN2 gene: a 647T-C transition in
exon 7, resulting in a phe216-to-ser (F216S) substitution on the
maternal allele, and a deletion of exons 7 and 8 (608507.0018) on the
paternal allele. Transcript analysis showed low levels of a shortened
transcript from the paternal allele, in which exon 6 was spliced to exon
9, suggested that some of the mutant transcript was subject to
nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. If translated, the deletion transcript
would result in a truncated out-of-frame protein lacking several
important domains. Thus, it could represent either a null mutation or
have a dominant-negative effect with reduced penetrance if coexpressed
with a normal allele. The patients had onset at 12 and 18 months,
respectively, of foot drop associated with marked upper and lower limb
muscle weakness. Pinprick sensation was decreased, whereas vibration
sense was basically preserved. One patient had optic atrophy and the
other had pale optic disc; both were wheelchair-bound later in
childhood. Each parent was clinically unaffected.

MFN2, THR362MET

In a Korean mother and daughter with CMT2A2 (609260), Chung et al.
(2006) identified a heterozygous 1085C-T transition in the MFN2 gene,
resulting in a thr362-to-met (T362M) substitution. The patients had late
onset and a mild phenotype.

In 2 adult Italian sibs with autosomal recessive inheritance of severe
early-onset CMT2A2 (609260), Polke et al. (2011) identified compound
heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the MFN2 gene: a T362M substitution on
the maternal allele, and a 3-bp in-frame deletion (113delAGA;
608507.0020) resulting in a deletion of lys38 (lys38del), presumably
from the paternal allele, although no DNA was available from the
deceased father. The patients had onset of foot drop and upper and lower
limb weakness at age 3 years. They also had decreased pinprick and
vibration senses, more severe in the lower limbs, kyphosis, pale optic
discs, visual loss, severe facial weakness, and respiratory muscle
weakness. One had hearing loss and vocal cord palsy. Both were
wheelchair-bound. Nerve conduction studies showed absence of nerve
conduction in 1 patient tested. Neither parent was affected. Polke et
al. (2011) noted that the T362M mutation had also been reported in
families with dominant transmission, suggesting that it has a
dominant-negative effect; the pathogenic effect of the lys38 deletion
mutation was unknown, although it was not found in 550 control
chromosomes.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

High molecular weight kininogen (HMWK) plays an important role in
assembly of the plasma kallikrein (see 147910)-kinin system. The KNG1
gene generates both HMWK and low molecular weight kininogen (LMWK)
through alternative splicing. Both HMWK and LMWK contain an identical
heavy chain consisting of protein domains 1, 2, and 3. However, HMWK
contains a 56-kD light chain that consists of domains 5 and 6H, whereas
LMWK contains a unique 4-kD light chain that consists of domain 5L. In
both proteins, the heavy and light chains are linked by domain 4, which
contains the bradykinin (BK) nonapeptide. BK, which is released by
plasma kallikrein, is a potent inflammatory mediator that causes
vasodilation and enhanced capillary permeability, induces pain, and
stimulates production of nitric oxide and prostacyclin (see 601699) from
endothelial cells. During vascular damage, BK stimulates smooth muscle
proliferation and intimal hypertrophy. Release of BK from HMWK generates
a 2-chain HMWK, termed HMWKa, containing the heavy and light chains
joined by a disulfide bond (Merkulov et al., 2008).

CLONING

In the 1970s, a number of similar patients with abnormal coagulation
tests but no apparent bleeding tendency were identified and described as
lacking a coagulation factor variously termed Fitzgerald factor,
Flaujeac factor, or Williams factor, among other names (see 228960). At
first the nature of these factors was uncertain, but further studies
showed that they were identical to high molecular weight kininogen
(Davie, 1979; Giangrande, 2003).

Takagaki et al. (1985) isolated human cDNAs encoding the HMW and LMW
prekininogens. They determined that the HMW and LMW prekininogen mRNAs
are identical throughout the 5-prime UTR and the protein-coding region
up to the sequence encoding the 12 amino acids distal to the BK
sequence, after which the 2 mRNAs completely diverge. The HMW and LMW
prekininogens contain 626 and 427 amino acids, respectively. They share
a common signal peptide, heavy chain, and BK moiety, which consist of
18, 362, and 9 amino acids, respectively. The unique light chains of HMW
and LMW prekininogens consist of 255 and 38 amino acids, respectively.
There are 17 cysteines in both the bovine and human heavy chain,
indicating that the human heavy chain, like its bovine counterpart, can
form 8 loops, each connected by 2 adjacent cysteines.

Merkulov et al. (2008) determined that the mouse genome contains 2
kininogen genes, Kng1 and Kng2, that are 91% identical. Using RT-PCR,
they found that Kng1 was expressed predominantly in liver and adrenal
gland, whereas Kng2 was expressed predominantly in kidney, with lower
expression in liver.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kitamura et al. (1985) determined that the KNG1 gene contains 11 exons
and spans 27 kb. Exons 1 through 9 encode the 5-prime UTR and the signal
peptide and heavy chain sequences common to both HMWK and LMWK. Exon 10
encodes the common sequence for BK and the unique sequence for HMWK, and
exon 11 encodes the unique sequence for LMWK.

MAPPING

Fong et al. (1991) mapped the KNG gene to chromosome 3 using
human-hamster somatic cell hybrids and the PCR of hybrid DNA with
gene-specific primers. KNG was further assigned to chromosome 3q26-qter
using DNA from a second panel of chromosome 3 deletion mapping cell
hybrids. Cheung et al. (1992) also mapped the KNG gene to chromosome
3q26-qter by in situ hybridization. The assignment substantiated the
evolutionary relationship of kininogen to 2 other members of the
cystatin superfamily, alpha-2HS-glycoprotein (AHSG; 138680) and
histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRG; 142640), which also map to the long
arm of chromosome 3.

Merkulov et al. (2008) determined that the 2 mouse kininogen genes, Kng1
and Kng2, are located in a head-to-head orientation on chromosome 16.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Cheung et al. (1993) demonstrated that Ms. Williams, the patient with
total kininogen deficiency (228960) reported by Colman et al. (1975),
was homozygous for a nonsense mutation in the KNG1 gene (612358.0001).

Krijanovski et al. (2003) found that a 6-year-old boy with cerebral
artery thrombosis and HMWK deficiency was homozygous for a 1-bp deletion
of 1492A in the KNG1 gene (612358.0002), corresponding to amino acid 480
of the mature protein. The mutation resulted in a frameshift and
premature termination at amino acid 532 of the mature protein. Each
parent and a sib were heterozygous for the mutation. Krijanovski et al.
(2003) found that truncation or frameshift at or before position 480 of
mature HMWK prevented biosynthesis, processing, and/or secretion of the
protein into plasma. Krijanovski et al. (2003) also identified the
causative mutation in Fitzgerald trait as a 17-bp substitution in intron
9 of the KNG1 gene (612358.0003). They provided a diagram comparing the
molecular defects of Williams trait (612358.0001), their reported
deletion of 1492A, and Fitzgerald trait with normal HMWK.

Using immunoblot and Southern blot analyses, Hayashi et al. (1990)
detected no molecular abnormality of kininogen in the DNA from patients
from 4 Japanese families with total kininogen deficiency or from 1
patient with isolated HMWK deficiency. However, in the patient with
isolated HMWK deficiency, a partial deletion in intron 7 was found by
restriction analysis. This partial deletion was assumed to be related to
an abnormality of alternative splicing of HMW prekininogen mRNA.
However, Shigekiyo et al. (2007) found that this patient with isolated
HMWK deficiency was homozygous for a 1-bp insertion (C) at nucleotide
1217 in exon 10 of the KNG1 gene (612358.0004). The insertion resulted
in a frameshift in codon 406 and a premature stop signal in codon 415.
The patient's parents and brother were heterozygous for the mutation.

- Association with Decreased Activated Partial Thromboplastin
Time

Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is considered a global test
of thrombotic tendency. A shortened aPTT is associated with an increased
risk of thrombosis as well as several prothrombotic risk factors
including age, female sex, estrogen use, and obesity. Prolonged aPTT is
an indicator of coagulation disorders in patients with deficiencies of
factors in the intrinsic pathways of coagulation. Houlihan et al. (2010)
conducted a genomewide association study for activated partial
thromboplastin time (aPTT) in a total of 1,477 relatively healthy adults
from the Lothian Birth Cohorts of 1936 (LBC1936) and 1921 (LBC1921). A
highly significant association with a relatively large effect size was
found between aPTT and a SNP in the KNG1 gene, dbSNP rs710446 (combined
p = 9.52 x 10(-22)). The SNP dbSNP rs710446 represents a missense
change, ile581 to thr (I581T, 1742T-C), in exon 10 of kininogen 1
isoform 1. The effects of dbSNP rs710446 were additive, with each G
allele decreasing aPTT by 0.36 standard deviations. This SNP explained
5.2% and 8.1% of the variance in aPTT in LBC1936 and LBC1921,
respectively. Mutations in KNG1 cause high molecular weight kininogen
(HMWK) deficiency, an autosomal recessive coagulation defect; Kng1
knockout mice demonstrate prolonged aPTT and delayed arterial thrombosis
(Merkulov et al., 2008).

Among 1,542 European patients with venous thrombosis (see 188050) and
1,110 controls, Morange et al. (2011) found a significant association
between the C allele of dbSNP rs710446 and risk of thrombosis (odds
ratio (OR) of 1.196; p = 0.0012) A borderline association was observed
in a small independent sample of 590 controls and 596 patients (OR of
1.171; p = 0.059). This allele was also associated with decreased aPTT
levels. Morange et al. (2011) concluded that the I581T variant is a
genetic risk factor for venous thrombosis.

ANIMAL MODEL

Merkulov et al. (2008) found that Kng1 -/- mice were viable and appeared
normal, although they lacked plasma HMWK and LMWK. Kng1 -/- mice showed
normal tail vein bleeding times, but they displayed significantly
prolonged time to vessel occlusion in an induced arterial thrombosis
model.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
KININOGEN DEFICIENCY, TOTAL
KNG1, ARG196TER

In the patient (Ms. Williams) with total kininogen deficiency (228960)
reported by Colman et al. (1975) as having Williams trait, Cheung et al.
(1993) found homozygosity for a C-to-T transition at nucleotide 22 in
exon 5 (nucleotide 587 of the cDNA) of the KNG1 gene, resulting in a CGA
(arg)-to-TGA (stop) mutation in exon 5. All 3 daughters were found to be
heterozygous and a granddaughter was found to be normal. In the proband,
both high and low molecular weight kininogens were completely absent;
the 3 daughters had approximately 50% high molecular weight kininogen
and the granddaughter had normal high molecular weight kininogen. Using
the amino acid count according to Nakanishi, which includes the signal
peptide, Kunapuli (1993) determined that the amino acid altered was
arg196.

.0002
HIGH MOLECULAR WEIGHT KININOGEN DEFICIENCY
KNG1, 1-BP DEL, 1492A

Krijanovski et al. (2003) described studies of the plasma and DNA of a
6-year-old male, born of first-cousin parents, with cerebral artery
thrombosis and HMWK deficiency (228960). The previously healthy child
had headache and vomiting 10 days after moderate cerebral trauma,
followed by loss of consciousness and subsequent visual impairment. CT
scan and angiography showed extensive left vertebral-basilar artery
thrombosis and a left vertebral artery dissection. The patient had a
prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and received
fresh frozen plasma before arteriography and then daily for 8 days,
which resulted in normalization of the APTT and resolution of neurologic
symptoms. There was full neurologic recovery with warfarin anticoagulant
therapy for 6 months, and there had been no recurrence after 2 years of
follow-up. The child had no high molecular weight kininogen procoagulant
activity and antigen (less than 1%). He was found to be homozygous for
deletion of an adenine at cDNA position 1492 in exon 10 of the KNG1
gene, corresponding to position 480 of the mature protein. The mutation
resulted in a frameshift and premature termination at amino acid 532 of
the mature protein. Each parent and a sib were heterozygous for the same
defect. Krijanovski et al. (2003) found that truncation or frameshift at
or before position 480 of mature HMWK prevented biosynthesis,
processing, and/or secretion of the protein into plasma.

.0003
HIGH MOLECULAR WEIGHT KININOGEN DEFICIENCY
KNG1, 17-BP DEL/17-BP INS, NT1559

The first plasma with HMWK deficiency (228960) to be recognized was
derived from an African American of the surname Fitzgerald (Waldmann et
al., 1975). Studying DNA prepared from a more that 25-year-old frozen
plasma specimen, Krijanovski et al. (2003) determined that the KNG1
defect in Fitzgerald trait resides in intron 9, with substitution of 17
consecutive basepairs at nucleotides 1559 through 1575. The substituted
segment had 1559T and 1575A at its 2 ends and consisted of 5 TGT
triplets, which in Fitzgerald DNA were changed to 5 GTG triplets, the
end nucleotides being changed to 1559G and 1575G. Also at nucleotide
position 1578, a GT sequence in normal DNA was changed to TG in
Fitzgerald intron 9. Furthermore, in Fitzgerald intron 9, single
basepair polymorphisms were found at nucleotide positions 119 (C to T),
1586 (T to G), and 1736 (A to G).

.0004
HIGH MOLECULAR WEIGHT KININOGEN DEFICIENCY
KNG1, 1-BP INS, 1217C

Using restriction analysis, Hayashi et al. (1990) found that a Japanese
patient with isolated HMWK deficiency (228960) had a partial deletion in
intron 7 of the KNG1 gene. This partial deletion was assumed to be
related to an abnormality of alternative splicing of HMW prekininogen
mRNA. However, Shigekiyo et al. (2007) found that this patient with
isolated HMWK deficiency was homozygous for a 1-bp insertion (C) at
nucleotide 1217 in exon 10 of the KNG1 gene. The insertion resulted in a
frameshift in codon 406 and a premature stop signal in codon 415. The
patient's brother and parents, who were second cousins, were
heterozygous for the mutation.

;;MITOGEN-INDUCIBLE GENE 6; MIG6;;
RECEPTOR-ASSOCIATED LATE TRANSDUCER; RALT;;
GENE 33, RAT, HOMOLOG OF
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ERRFI1 is a cytoplasmic protein whose expression is upregulated with
cell growth (Wick et al., 1995). It shares significant homology with the
protein product of rat gene-33, which is induced during cell stress and
mediates cell signaling (Makkinje et al., 2000; Fiorentino et al.,
2000).

CLONING

By differential screening of cDNA libraries developed from unstimulated
versus serum-stimulated lung fibroblasts, followed by 5-prime RACE of a
hepatoma cell cDNA library, Wick et al. (1995) cloned ERRFI1, which they
called MIG6. The deduced protein contains 462 amino acids and shares
significant homology with the rat gene-33 protein product.
Epitope-tagged MIG6 showed exclusively cytoplasmic staining following
transfection into mouse fibroblasts.

Makkinje et al. (2000) determined that the protein encoded by rat
gene-33 contains a CRIB domain, an SH3-binding motif, a 14-3-3 (see
113508)-binding domain, an ACK (606994) homology domain, and a
PDZ-binding region. Makkinje et al. (2000) hypothesized that the protein
is an adaptor capable of binding monomeric GTPases of the Rho (see
602924) subfamily.

GENE FUNCTION

Wick et al. (1995) determined that serum induction of the MIG6
transcript was blocked by inhibition of RNA polymerase and was partially
blocked by inhibitors of protein synthesis. In contrast to other
mitogen-responsive genes, MIG6 mRNA expression was also regulated during
normal cell cycle progression, showing a clear peak around mid-G1.
Consistent with cell cycle regulation, terminal differentiation of
myeloid leukemia cells to either granulocytic or macrophage-like cells
led to clear changes in MIG6 mRNA levels. The pattern of MIG6 expression
depended upon the lineage induced.

Makkinje et al. (2000) determined that gene-33 mRNA was induced in rat
renal mesangial cells following osmotic stress, exposure to human
endothelin-1 (131240) or angiotensin-2 (106150), or calcium
mobilization. It was also induced in human pulmonary epithelial cells
following mechanical strain. Gene-33 protein interacted in vivo with
CDC42 (116952); in vitro, this interaction was GTP-dependent. Transient
expression of gene-33 in human embryonic kidney cells resulted in
selective activation of stress-activated protein kinases (see MAPK8;
601158).

Fiorentino et al. (2000) showed that the rat gene-33 protein, which they
designated Ralt, interacted with Erbb2 (164870). Direct interaction
required the catalytic activity of Erbb2. Expression of gene-33 was
absent in quiescent mouse fibroblasts but was induced following serum
stimulation. Overexpression of gene-33 in mouse fibroblasts inhibited
several Erbb2-dependent processes, including cell proliferation, cell
transformation, and the sustained activation of Erk1 (601795) and Erk2
(176948). Overexpression did not inhibit cell proliferation or ERK
activation induced by serum, and it did not inhibit cell transformation
induced by Ras (190020) or Src (190090). Fiorentino et al. (2000)
hypothesized that gene-33 is a feedback inhibitor of Erbb2 and
suppresses its mitogenic and oncogenic activity.

By Western blot analysis, Ferby et al. (2006) found undetectable MIG6
levels in 6 of 9 human breast cancer cell lines expressing EGFR
(131550). Of those, 3 cell lines showed the highest levels of EGFR
phosphorylation. In contrast, the 3 cell lines expressing MIG6 had low
to undetectable phosphorylation of EGFR. Depletion of MIG6 by siRNA
resulted in increased phosphorylation of EGFR over time as MIG6 protein
levels decreased. Ferby et al. (2006) concluded that downregulation of
MIG6 leads to activation of ERBB signaling.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Zhang et al. (2007) determined the crystal structure of a complex
between the EGFR kinase domain and a fragment of MIG6 at 2.9-angstrom
resolution, which showed that an approximately 25-residue epitope from
MIG6 binds to the distal surface of the C lobe of the kinase domain.
Biochemical and cell-based analyses confirmed that this interaction
contributes to EGFR inhibition by blocking the formation of the
activating dimer interface. A longer MIG6 peptide that is extended C
terminal to segment 1 has increased potency as an inhibitor of the
activated EGFR kinase domain, while retaining a critical dependence on
segment 1. Zhang et al. (2007) showed that signaling by EGFR molecules
that contain constitutively active kinase domains still requires
formation of the asymmetric dimer, underscoring the importance of dimer
interface blockage in MIG6-mediated inhibition.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the ERRFI1
gene to chromosome 1 (TMAP stSG4733).

ANIMAL MODEL

Zhang et al. (2005) found that Mig6 -/- mice were viable, but they were
born in less than the expected ratio, indicating some embryonic
lethality. Although Mig6 was highly expressed in wildtype mouse liver
and kidney, no obvious pathologic changes were observed in these tissues
in Mig6 -/- mice. Instead, most Mig6 -/- mice showed an abnormal gait at
1 month of age. With time, they showed progressive enlargement and
deformity of multiple joints, including bony outgrowths or osteophyte
formation within joint spaces, especially the knees, ankles, and
temporomandibular joints (TMJs). All Mig6 -/- mice developed joint
deformities, and the majority died within 6 months, most likely due to
TMJ ankylosis, resulting in the inability to eat or drink. The
osteophyte formation appeared to be due to proliferation of mesenchymal
progenitor cells, followed by differentiation into chondrocytes.

Ferby et al. (2006) found that Errfi1 -/- mice were born at the expected
mendelian ratio and, within a few days after birth, they showed a fully
penetrant skin phenotype characterized by thickening, flaking, and
ulceration of tail and footpad skin. The epidermal hyperplasia varied
somewhat in severity, depending on genetic background. Most Errfi1 -/-
mice also had a 5- to 10-day delay in the opening of the eyelids
compared with control littermates. Deletion of the Errfi1 gene caused
hyperactivation of endogenous Egfr and sustained signaling through the
MAPK (see MAPK1; 176948) pathway, resulting in overproliferation and
impaired differentiation of epidermal keratinocytes. Ferby et al. (2006)
showed that Errfi1 -/- mice developed spontaneous tumors in various
organs and were highly susceptible to chemically induced skin tumors.

605170	TITLE *605170 ETOPOSIDE-INDUCED 1.4 mRNA; EI24
;;EI24, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF;;
p53-INDUCED GENE 8; PIG8
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The EI24 gene is an immediate-early response gene that is directly
regulated by p53 (TP53; 191170), suppresses cell growth, and induces
cell death (Gu et al., 2000).

CLONING

DNA damage and/or hyperproliferative signals activate wildtype p53 tumor
suppressor protein (TP53; 191170), inducing cell cycle arrest or
apoptosis. Mutations that inactivate p53 occur in 50% of all tumors.
Polyak et al. (1997) used serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) to
evaluate cellular mRNA levels in a colorectal cancer cell line
transfected with p53. Of 7,202 transcripts identified, only 14 were
expressed at levels more than 10-fold higher in p53-expressing cells
than in control cells. Polyak et al. (1997) termed these genes
'p53-induced genes,' or PIGs, several of which, including PIG8, were
predicted to encode redox-controlling proteins. They noted that reactive
oxygen species (ROS) are potent inducers of apoptosis. Flow cytometric
analysis showed that p53 expression induces ROS production, which
increases as apoptosis progresses under some conditions. The authors
stated that PIG8 is the human homolog of murine ei24, an
etoposide-induced gene.

By analysis of a BAC clone, Gu et al. (2000) determined that the PIG8
sequence reported by Polyak et al. (1997) is incorrect and that the
corrected 358-amino acid PIG8 protein shares 98% amino acid identity
with ei24. Western blot analysis indicated that ei24 expression is
approximately 500-fold higher in dead cells than in healthy cells. Phase
contrast and fluorescence microscopy showed that cells expressing Ei24
but not those coexpressing the apoptosis suppressor BCL2L1 (600039)
displayed the typical morphologic features of apoptosis. These results
suggested that ei24 suppresses cell growth through the activation of an
apoptotic pathway.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a murine myeloid leukemia cell line expressing a
temperature-sensitive p53 gene, Gu et al. (2000) showed that ei24, the
murine homolog of PIG8, directly responds to p53 as an immediate-early
response gene and is not induced secondary to p53-mediated cell death.
Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis demonstrated that purified
wildtype p53 protein specifically binds to a p53 response element in the
ei24 protein.

MAPPING

By FISH, Gu et al. (2000) mapped the PIG8 gene to 11q23, a region
frequently altered in cancers. Gu et al. (2000) mapped the mouse Ei24
gene to the proximal region of chromosome 9.

602597	TITLE *602597 B-CELL CLL/LYMPHOMA 9; BCL9
;;LEGLESS, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF; LGS
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Studying a cell line (CEMO-1) from a patient with precursor-B-cell acute
lymphoblastic leukemia with a t(1;14)(q21;q32), Willis et al. (1998)
identified a fusion partner of the IGHJ gene (147010) on 14q. One allele
showed novel sequences upstream of JH5 with no homology to either IGH or
any other sequence in databases. Using a single-copy restriction
fragment immediately 5-prime of JH5, PAC clones were isolated and mapped
to 1q21 on normal metaphases by fluorescence in situ hybridization,
confirming that this allele represented the translocation breakpoint.
Sequence analysis of the 1q21 restriction fragment showed identity with
an expressed sequenced tag, and this probe was therefore used to probe
Northern blots. Willis et al. (1998) designated the gene on 1q21 BCL9.
Sequence analysis predicted a protein of 1,394 amino acids, with no
recognizable protein motifs or significant homologies to known proteins.
The CEMO-1 1q21 breakpoint fell within the 3-prime untranslated region
(UTR) of the BCL9 gene. By screening of a panel of 39 B-cell
malignancies with 1q abnormalities by Southern blotting, Willis et al.
(1998) found 1 additional case with a breakpoint in the 3-prime UTR of
BCL9, indicating that this is a recurrent breakpoint. Fluorescence in
situ hybridization analysis using an 850-kb YAC spanning BCL9 identified
a further case of t(1;22)(q21;q11) causing juxtaposition of BCL9 to the
IGL locus (147220).

MAPPING

By analysis of a translocation t(1;14)(q21;q32) breakpoint, Willis et
al. (1998) mapped the BCL9 gene to chromosome 1q21.

GENE FUNCTION

WNT (see 602863) signaling controls many fundamental processes during
animal development. WNT transduction is mediated by the association of
beta-catenin (116806) with nuclear TCF (e.g., LEF1; 153245) DNA-binding
factors. Kramps et al. (2002) identified 2 segment polarity genes in
Drosophila, legless (Lgs), and pygopus (Pygo), and showed that their
products are required for WNT signal transduction at the level of
nuclear beta-catenin. Lgs encodes the homolog of human BCL9, and the
authors provided genetic and molecular evidence that these proteins
exert their function by physically linking Pygo to beta-catenin. Kramps
et al. (2002) identified 2 human homologs of the Drosophila Pygo gene,
PYGO1 (606902)and PYGO2 (606903), that possess a highly conserved PHD
finger that interacts with homology domain-1 (HD1) of BCL9. The findings
suggested that the recruitment of PYGO permits beta-catenin to
transcriptionally activate WNT target genes and raised the possibility
that a deregulation of these events may play a causal role in the
development of B-cell malignancies.

615367	TITLE *615367 N-TERMINAL ASPARAGINE AMIDASE; NTAN1
;;N-TERMINAL ASPARAGINE AMIDOHYDROLASE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The N-end rule relates the in vivo half-life of a protein to the
identity of its N-terminal residue. By enzymatic deamidation, NTAN1
converts the tertiary destabilizing N-terminal residue asparagine to the
secondary destabilizing residue aspartate (Grigoryev et al., 1996).

CLONING

Grigoryev et al. (1996) cloned mouse Ntan1, which encodes a deduced
310-amino acid protein. By database analysis, they identified 2 splice
variants of human NTAN1. Full-length mouse and human NTAN1 share 92%
amino acid identity. Northern blot analysis detected variable expression
of an approximately 1.4-kb transcript in all 8 mouse tissues examined,
with lowest expression in testis. A transcript of about 1.1 kb was
prominently expressed in testis only.

GENE FUNCTION

By assaying yeast expressing mouse Ntan1, Grigoryev et al. (1996) found
that Ntan1 showed amidase activity toward N-terminal asparagine, but not
N-terminal glutamine, and reduced the half-life of the deamidated test
protein. Northern blot analysis showed that Ntan1 expression decreased
following differentiation in C2C12 mouse myoblasts, but not in MEL mouse
leukemia cells.

MAPPING

Hartz (2013) mapped the NTAN1 gene to chromosome 16p13.11 based on an
alignment of the NTAN1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF092440) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

By interspecific backcross analysis, Grigoryev et al. (1996) mapped the
mouse Ntan1 gene to a proximal region of mouse chromosome 16 that shares
homology of synteny with human chromosome 16p.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Pall et al. (2004) cloned mouse Mospd3 and identified the human MOSPD3
gene. The deduced 235-amino acid MOSPD3 protein contains an N-terminal
major sperm protein domain and 2 transmembrane domains.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Pall et al. (2004) mapped the MOSPD3 gene
to chromosome 7q22. They mapped the mouse Mospd3 gene to a region of
chromosome 5 that shows homology of synteny to human chromosome 7q22.

ANIMAL MODEL

Pall et al. (2004) found that homozygous Mospd3-null mice had a right
ventricle defect with 50% probability of neonatal lethality. The
phenotypic defect was dependent on the genetic background, indicating
the presence of modifier loci.

610656	TITLE *610656 CYSTEINE CONJUGATE BETA-LYASE 2; CCBL2
;;KYNURENINE AMINOTRANSFERASE III; KAT3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Kynurenic acid (KYNA), a metabolite of tryptophan, is a broad-spectrum
antagonist of excitatory amino acid receptors, suggesting it may
participate in normal brain function as a modulator of glutamatergic
neurotransmission. The level of KYNA is altered in several
neurodegenerative diseases. KAT3 is a kynurenine aminotransferase that
forms KYNA by transamination of kynurenine (Yu et al., 2006).

CLONING

By searching databases for sequences similar to KAT1 (CCBL1; 600547) and
KAT2 (AADAT; 611754), followed by PCR of brain cDNA libraries, Yu et al.
(2006) cloned mouse and human CCBL2, which they called KAT3. The deduced
454-amino acid human protein has a calculated molecular mass of 51.4 kD
and shares 83.7% identity with mouse Kat3. Yu et al. (2006) also
identified a human KAT3 splice variant that lacks exon 2 and encodes a
deduced 420-amino acid protein. Northern blot analysis of mouse tissues
detected strong expression in liver, kidney, and heart, and weaker
expression in brain and testis. Expression of Kat3 increased in mouse
tissues from postnatal day 7 through 17.

GENE FUNCTION

Yu et al. (2006) noted that Kat2 -/- mice have lower hippocampal KYNA
levels and are hyperactive compared with wildtype mice, but these
abnormalities occur early and are transitory. Yu et al. (2006) found
that Kat1 and Kat3 expression, when measured together, was higher in
Kat2 -/- mice at postnatal day 60, but not at postnatal days 7, 14, 21,
or 28, compared with wildtype mice. The increased Kat1 and Kat3
expression paralleled restoration of the normal phenotype in Kat2 -/-
mice. Yu et al. (2006) concluded that upregulation of Kat1 and Kat3
compensates for loss of Kat2 in Kat2 -/- mice.

GENE STRUCTURE

Yu et al. (2006) determined that the CCBL2 gene contains 14 exons and
spans about 143 kb. The first exon is noncoding.

MAPPING

By database analysis, Yu et al. (2006) mapped the CCBL2 gene to
chromosome 1p22.2. They mapped the mouse Ccbl2 gene to chromosome 3.

612959	TITLE *612959 EPITHELIAL SPLICING REGULATORY PROTEIN 1; ESRP1
;;RNA-BINDING MOTIF PROTEIN 35A; RBM35A
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ESPR1 is an epithelial cell-type-specific splicing regulator (Warzecha
et al., 2009).

CLONING

Using a cell-based cDNA expression screen with human embryonic kidney
293T cells, Warzecha et al. (2009) identified mouse Esrp1 and Esrp2
(612960) as regulators of FGFR2 (176943) splicing. By database analysis,
they identified human ESRP1, which encodes a deduced 681-amino acid
protein containing 3 central RNA recognition motifs (RRMs). Comparison
of ESRP orthologs in diverse species showed significant sequence
conservation within the RRM domains, particularly RRM1. In situ
hybridization of neonatal and adult mice revealed distinct
epithelial-specific expression of Esrp1 in diverse tissues and organs,
with highest expression in skin and gastrointestinal epithelia.

GENE FUNCTION

Cell type-specific expression of epithelial and mesenchymal isoforms of
FGFR2 is achieved through tight regulation of mutually exclusive exons
IIIb and IIIc, respectively. Warzecha et al. (2009) showed that
expression of epitope-tagged mouse Esrp1 or Esrp2 in 293T cells induced
a substantial switch of endogenous FGFR2 transcripts from the
mesenchymal form with exon IIIc to the epithelial form with exon IIIb.
Microarray analysis revealed that cell lines classified as epithelial
expressed higher levels of ESRP1 and/or ESRP2 than cell lines classified
as mesenchymal. Depletion of ESRP1 and ESRP2 in a human prostate
epithelial cell line via RNA interference (RNAi) caused a significant
switch from exon IIIb to exon IIIc splicing in the endogenous FGFR2
transcript. Rescue experiments with mouse cDNAs showed that FGFR2-IIIb
splicing was more dependent on ESRP1 than ESRP2. RNAi experiments
revealed that ESRP1 and ESRP2 also regulated splicing of CD44 (107269),
CTNND1 (601045), and ENAH (609061), transcripts that undergo changes in
splicing during the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.

MAPPING

Hartz (2009) mapped the ESRP1 gene to chromosome 8q22.1 based on an
alignment of the ESRP1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK00178) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

;;TBP1-INTERACTING PROTEIN; TBPIP;;
GT198;;
HOP2, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; HOP2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The PSMC3IP gene encodes a nuclear, tissue-specific protein with
multiple functions, including a role in meiotic recombination and as a
coactivator of ligand-dependent transcription mediated by nuclear
hormone receptors (summary by Zangen et al., 2011).

CLONING

By sequencing putative genes centromeric to the BRCA1 gene (113705) on
chromosome 17, followed by screening a breast cancer cell line cDNA
library, Rommens et al. (1995) cloned GT198. The deduced protein
contains 203 amino acids. Northern blot analysis detected a 1.6-kb
transcript in all adult and fetal tissues examined, with abundant
expression in testis, colon, a breast cancer cell line, and a lymphoma.

Tanaka et al. (1997) cloned Gt198, which they called Tbpip, from a mouse
testis cDNA library. The deduced 217-amino acid protein has several
putative phosphorylation sites. RT-PCR detected Tbpip expression in CD4
(186940)-positive T cells and in macrophages. In situ hybridization
found Tbpip mRNA colocalized with Tbp1 (186852) in seminiferous tubules
of adult mouse testis. Western blot analysis detected Tbpip at an
apparent molecular mass of 24 kD. Immunohistochemical analysis of mouse
testis detected Tbpip in nuclei of primary and secondary spermatocytes.

By PCR using primers designed from mouse Tbpip, Ijichi et al. (2000)
cloned full-length human TBPIP from breast cancer cell line mRNA and a
testis cDNA library. The deduced 217-amino acid protein contains an
acidic region near the C terminus and several putative phosphorylation
sites. Mouse and human TBPIP share 88% amino acid homology.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Rommens et al. (1995) mapped the TBPIP
gene to chromosome 17q21. Using radiation hybrid analysis, Ijichi et al.
(2000) mapped the TBPIP gene to chromosome 17q12-q21.

GENE FUNCTION

The human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) regulatory protein Tat is
essential for HIV-1 gene expression and replication in infected cells.
TBP1 is a cellular protein that suppresses Tat-mediated transactivation
of HIV replication. Tanaka et al. (1997) found that mouse Tbpip
synergistically cooperated with Tbp1 to suppress Tat-mediated
transactivation of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat promoter.

Ijichi et al. (2000) showed that human TBPIP interacted directly with
TBP1 and enhanced TBP1-mediated inhibition of HIV Tat-mediated
transactivation.

Enomoto et al. (2006) demonstrated that coexpression of human MND1
(611422) and HOP2 in E. coli resulted in the formation of stable
heterodimers. The HOP2-MND1 complex stimulated DMC1 (602721)- and RAD51
(179617)-mediated DNA strand exchange, and preferentially bound to a
3-stranded DNA branch, which mimics the strand-exchange intermediate.
Enomoto et al. (2006) concluded that the HOP2-MND1 complex may ensure
proper pairing between homologous chromosomes by stimulating strand
exchange during meiosis.

Chi et al. (2007) found that the Hop2 component of the mouse recombinant
Hop2-Mnd1 complex was the major DNA-binding subunit, and that Mnd1 was
the Rad51-interacting entity. Hop2-Mnd1 stabilized the
Rad51-single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) nucleoprotein filament, and enhanced
the ability of the Rad51-ssDNA nucleoprotein filament to capture duplex
DNA, which is an obligatory step in the formation of the synaptic
complex critical for DNA joint formation. Pezza et al. (2007) showed
that the mouse Hop2-Mnd1 complex stimulated Dmc1 to promote synaptic
complex formation on long duplex DNAs. Synaptic alignment was a
consequence of the ability of Hop2-Mnd1 to stabilize the Dmc1-ssDNA
nucleoprotein complex and facilitate the conjoining of DNA molecules
through the capture of double-stranded DNA by the Dmc1-ssDNA
nucleoprotein filament.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a large consanguineous Arab Palestinian pedigree with
hypergonadotropic ovarian dysgenesis mapping to chromosome 17 (ODG3;
614324), Zangen et al. (2011) analyzed candidate genes and identified
homozygosity for a 3-bp deletion in the PSMC3IP gene (608665.0001) that
segregated with disease in the family. In cell lines, the glu201del
mutation abolished PSMC3IP activation of estrogen-driven transcription.

ANIMAL MODEL

Petukhova et al. (2003) found that Hop2 knockout mice showed no gross
anomalies in somatic tissues but developed a profound deficiency in
gametogenesis. Hop2 -/- spermatocytes arrested at the stage of
pachytene-like chromosome condensation. Axial elements were fully
developed, but synapsis was limited. While meiotic double-stranded
breaks were formed and processed in Hop2 -/- mice, they failed to be
repaired.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
OVARIAN DYSGENESIS 3
PSMC3IP, 3-BP DEL, 600GAG

In affected members of a large consanguineous Arab Palestinian pedigree
with hypergonadotropic ovarian dysgenesis (ODG3; 614324), Zangen et al.
(2011) identified homozygosity for an in-frame 3-bp deletion in the
acceptor splice junction of exon 8 of the PSMC3IP gene, resulting in
deletion of glu201. The unaffected parents were heterozygous for the
deletion, which was not found in 254 ethnically matched chromosomes.
RT-PCR analysis of leukocyte DNA from affected and unaffected family
members showed no alternative splicing, suggesting that the mutation
does not affect PSMC3IP splicing. Transfection studies in the IGROV1
ovarian carcinoma and MCF7 breast cancer cell lines demonstrated that
the glu201del mutation abolished PSMC3IP activation of estrogen-driven
transcription.

611574	TITLE *611574 SPHINGOMYELIN SYNTHASE 2; SGMS2
;;SMS2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Sphingomyelin (SM) is a major component of plasma membranes. It is
preferentially concentrated in the outer leaflet and has a role in the
formation of lipid rafts. SM synthases (EC 2.7.8.27), such as SGMS2,
produce SM in the lumen of the Golgi and on the cell surface through the
transfer of phosphocholine from phosphatidylcholine onto ceramide,
yielding diacylglycerol as a side product (Huitema et al., 2004).

CLONING

By searching databases for sequences encoding motifs characteristic of
SM synthases, Huitema et al. (2004) identified SGMS2, which they called
SMS2. The deduced 366-amino acid protein contains 5 membrane-spanning
alpha helices connected by hydrophilic extramembrane loops as well as 4
highly conserved motifs, designated D1 to D4. Protease protection
analysis of transfected HeLa cells revealed that the C terminus was
cytosolic, indicating that the putative active site residues are in the
extracellular space. Northern blot analysis of human tissues detected a
1.9-kb transcript in brain, heart, kidney, liver, muscle, and stomach.
SGMS2 localized primarily to the plasma membrane as well as to the Golgi
apparatus.

GENE FUNCTION

By heterologous expression in S. cerevisiae, Huitema et al. (2004)
showed that human SGMS2 formed SM in the presence of choline and
ceramide. Both phosphatidylcholine and SM itself were utilized as
phosphorylcholine group donors, but lysophosphatidylcholine was a very
poor substrate, and other donors, including other phospholipids, did not
support SM formation. Huitema et al. (2004) concluded that SGMS2
requires 2 fatty chains on the phosphocholine donor molecule for it to
be utilized as a substrate. SGMS2 could also catalyze the reverse
reaction.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the SGMS2
gene to chromosome 4 (TMAP STS-H01973).

;;IMMUNOGLOBULIN G Fc RECEPTOR III-2;;
FCRIII-2;;
CD16A
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The Fc receptor with low affinity for IgG (FCGR3, or CD16) is encoded by
2 nearly identical genes, FCGR3A and FCGR3B (610665), resulting in
tissue-specific expression of alternative membrane-anchored isoforms.
FCGR3A encodes a transmembrane protein expressed on activated
monocytes/macrophages, natural killer (NK) cells, and a subset of T
cells. In contrast, FCGR3B encodes a glycosylphosphatidylinositol
(GPI)-anchored protein that is expressed constitutively by neutrophils
and after gamma-interferon (IFNG; 147570) stimulation by eosinophils
(summary by Gessner et al., 1995).

CLONING

By Western blot and flow cytometric analyses, Ravetch and Perussia
(1989) demonstrated differential expression of FCGR3 on
polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) and NK cells. The glycoprotein on
NK cells (FCGR3A) had a molecular mass 6 to 10 kD larger than that on
neutrophils (FCGR3B) and was resistant to phosphatidylinositol-specific
phospholipase C. Transcripts derived from FCGR3A and FCGR3B in NK cells
and PMNs, respectively, have multiple single nucleotide differences,
including 1 that converts a termination codon to a codon encoding arg,
thereby extending the cytoplasmic domain by 21 amino acids and
introducing a transmembrane anchor for FCGR3A in NK cells. The deduced
FCGR3A protein contains 254 amino acids, whereas the deduced FCGR3B
protein contains 233 amino acids. Ravetch and Perussia (1989) concluded
that cell type-specific expression of 2 genes encoding alternative FCGR3
proteins has a significant effect on the biologic functions of the
molecules.

GENE STRUCTURE

Gessner et al. (1995) isolated and sequenced genomic clones of FCGR3A
and FCGR3B, located their transcription initiation sites, identified the
different organizations of their 5-prime regions, and demonstrated 4
distinct classes of FCGR3A transcripts compared with a single class of
FCGR3B transcripts. The gene promoters displayed different
tissue-specific transcriptional activities reflecting expression of
FCGR3A in NK cells and FCGR3B in neutrophils.

MAPPING

Le Coniat et al. (1990) mapped the FCGR3A gene to chromosome 1q23 by in
situ hybridization.

GENE FUNCTION

Anderson et al. (1990) concluded that CD16 is included in the zeta
natural killer cell receptor complex (CD3Z; 186780).

Some gamma-delta T cells (see TCRG, 186970 and TCRD, 186810) express
CD16. Using flow cytometric analysis, Bodman-Smith et al. (2000)
examined the relative proportions of CD16+ gamma-delta T cells in the
blood and synovial fluid of rheumatoid arthritis (RA; 180300) patients
and the blood of control subjects. There was a significant reduction in
CD16+ gamma-delta T cells in synovial fluid compared with the
circulation. Mitogenic stimulation of circulating gamma-delta T cells
resulted in an increased expression of the HLA-DR activation marker and
a concomitant time-dependent decrease in the expression of CD16.
Bodman-Smith et al. (2000) concluded that CD16 expression is lost in the
synovial compartment as a result of activation.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

On the natural killer (NK) cells of a 3-year-old boy who suffered from
recurrent viral respiratory tract infections since birth, de Vries et
al. (1996) found an unusual CD16 phenotype. The child also had severe
clinical problems with BCG vaccination and after Epstein-Barr virus and
varicella-zoster virus infections. His peripheral blood lymphocytes
contained a normal percentage and absolute number of CD3(-)CD7(+) cells,
which were positively stained with CD16 monoclonal antibodies. FCGR3
expression on granulocytes appeared to be normal. Sequence analysis of
the FCGR3A gene, encoding CD16 on NK cells and macrophages, showed a
T-to-A nucleotide substitution at position 230 on both alleles,
predicting a leucine to histidine amino acid change at position 48
(146740.0002).

By cloning and sequencing FCGR3A cDNA from NK cells and macrophages of a
heterozygous donor, de Haas et al. (1996) identified a 230T-G SNP that
resulted in a leu48-to-arg (L48R) substitution in the first
extracellular Ig-like domain and caused a higher electrophoretic
mobility of deglycosylated FCGR3A. PCR and restriction analysis
identified a 230T-A SNP, resulting in a leu48-to-his (L48H)
substitution, in another donor. Genotype analysis revealed a gene
frequency of 86% for 230T (L48), 6% for 230G (R48), and 8% for 230A
(H48) in 93 FCGR3B-positive individuals. In contrast, the frequency of
the 230G allele was significantly higher in 12 FCGR3B-deficient donors.
The H48 and R48 variants exhibited a higher binding capacity for IgG1,
IgG3, and IgG4 than did the common L48 variant. De Haas et al. (1996)
concluded that SNPs at position 230 of FCGR3A influence IgG binding, as
well as reactivity of CD16 monoclonal antibodies.

Koene et al. (1997) used PCR-based restriction analysis to genotype 87
donors for a 559T-G SNP in FCGR3A that results in a phe158-to-val
(F158V) substitution. They found gene frequencies of 57% and 43% for
F158 and V158, respectively. F158 was linked to L48, and V158 was linked
to R48 or H48. Through functional analysis, Koene et al. (1997)
determined that the previously identified differences in IgG binding
among the 3 FCGR3A variants at position 48 are a consequence of the
linked polymorphism at position 158.

Among 1,115 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA; 180300) and 654
controls, Robinson et al. (2012) found no significant association
between FCGR3A copy number and disease.

Although nearly all adults have been exposed to herpes simplex virus
(HSV)-1, the clinical course of infection varies remarkably. By
analyzing the contribution of gene families on chromosomes 1, 6, 12, and
19 to susceptibility to HSV-1 infection in 302 individuals, Moraru et
al. (2012) identified no specific susceptibility locus. However, they
found that the risk of suffering clinical HSV-1 infection was modified
by MHC class I allotypes, HLA-C1 (142840) interaction with KIR2DL2
(604937), and the phe/val polymorphism at codon 158 of CD16A.

EVOLUTION

By determining the nature and rate of copy number variation (CNV)
mutation and investigating the global variation of disease-associated
variation at the FCGR locus, Machado et al. (2012) determined that CNV
of the FCGR3 genes is mediated by recurrent nonallelic homologous
recombination between the 2 segmental duplications that carry FCGR3A and
FCGR3B. They showed that pathogen richness, particularly helminth
pathogens, is likely to have influenced the patterns of variation in
FCGRs in humans. Machado et al. (2012) proposed that alterations to IgG
binding in the context of helminth infection have driven positive
selection in FCGR among different mammalian species, linking
evolutionary pressure of helminth infection with autoimmune disease via
adaptation at the genetic level. This model supports the 'hygiene
hypothesis,' which states that in the absence of chronic helminth
infection in modern populations, previously selected alleles respond to
immune system challenges differently and therefore may alter
susceptibility to autoimmune disease.

ANIMAL MODEL

Pinheiro da Silva et al. (2007) found that Fcrg (FCER1G; 147139) -/-
mice showed reduced mortality in an acute peritonitis model caused by
cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) compared with wildtype mice. The
reduced mortality in Fcrg -/- mice was associated with lower serum and
peritoneal Tnf (191160) and significantly increased capacity of
neutrophils and macrophages to phagocytose E. coli. Fcgr3 -/- mice also
had reduced sepsis after CLP. Fcgr3 bound E. coli, inducing Fcrg
phosphorylation, recruitment of tyrosine phosphatase Shp1 (PTPN6;
176883), and dephosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K;
see 171834). Decreased Pi3k activity inhibited E. coli phagocytosis and
increased Tnf production through Tlr4 (603030). Confocal microscopy
demonstrated negative regulation of Marco (604870) by Fcrg. Interaction
of E. coli with Fcgr3 induced recruitment of Shp1 to Marco and inhibited
E. coli phagocytosis. Pinheiro da Silva et al. (2007) concluded that
binding of E. coli to FCGR3 triggers an inhibitory FCRG pathway that
impairs MARCO-mediated bacterial clearance and activates TNF secretion.

In a 3-year-old boy who had suffered from recurrent viral respiratory
tract infections since birth, de Vries et al. (1996) found an unusual
CD16 phenotype on the natural killer (NK) cells. Sequence analysis of
the IGFR3 gene showed a T-to-A nucleotide substitution at position 230
on both alleles, predicting a leucine-to-histidine amino acid change at
position 48 in the first extracellular Ig-like domain of the FCGR3A
protein. The child had also had severe problems with BCG vaccination and
with Epstein-Barr virus and varicella-zoster virus infections. The
clinical pattern was considered compatible with an in vivo dysfunction
of NK cells. Only 1 patient with absolute NK cell deficiency had been
previously described. Biron et al. (1989) reported the case of an
adolescent with recurrent life-threatening herpesvirus infections, who
completely lacked CD16 and/or CD56 positive cells in vivo and
NK-activity in vitro. In a note added in proof, de Vries et al. (1996)
called attention to the case of homozygosity for a IGFR3 mutation
reported by Jawahar et al. (1996).
