300161	TITLE *300161 EUKARYOTIC TRANSLATION INITIATION FACTOR 2, SUBUNIT 3; EIF2S3
;;EUKARYOTIC TRANSLATION INITIATION FACTOR 2, GAMMA; EIF2G
DESCRIPTION Translation initiation factor eIF-2 is a heterotrimeric GTP-binding
protein involved in the recruitment of methionyl-tRNA(i) to the 40 S
ribosomal subunit. Gaspar et al. (1994) cloned a human cDNA encoding the
largest subunit of eIF-2, EIF2G. The EIF2G cDNA encodes a 472-amino acid
protein with a molecular mass of 51.8 kD and contains 3 consensus
GTP-binding elements. Human EIF2G is highly related to the yeast
homolog, GCD11, exhibiting 71% sequence identity and an additional 13%
similarity.

Genes controlling the functions of spermatogenesis, Spy, and expression
of the male-specific minor transplantation antigen H-Y, Hya (426000),
map to a region of the short arm of the mouse Y chromosome,
delta-Sxr(b), that lies between the zinc finger genes Zfy1 and Zfy2
(490000) and is deleted in Sxr(b) mutant mice. These Sxr(b) mice arose
from an original sex-reversed mutation, Sxr(a), that carries a
duplication of most of the Y chromosome short arm translocated to the
telomeric end of the pseudoautosomal region of the Y chromosome. Several
genes were mapped to that interval of the mouse Y chromosome and each
was found to have a homolog on the X chromosome. Four of them, Zfy1 and
Zfy2 (490000), Ube1y (489000), and Dffry (400005), are expressed
specifically in the testis and their X homologs (Zfx, 314980; Ube1x,
314370; Dffrx, 300072) are not transcribed from the inactive X
chromosome. A further 2, Smyc (426000) and Uty (400009), are
ubiquitously expressed and their X homologs (Jarid1c/Smcx, 314690; Utx,
300128) escape X inactivation. Ehrmann et al. (1998) identified another
gene from this region of the mouse Y chromosome. It was found to encode
the highly conserved eukaryotic translation initiation factor
eIF-2-gamma. In the mouse this gene was found to be ubiquitously
expressed, to have an X chromosome homolog that maps close to Dmd
(300377), and to escape X inactivation. The coding regions of the X and
Y genes show 86% nucleotide identity and encode the putative products
with 98% amino acid identity. Ehrmann et al. (1998) found that the human
homolog is located on Xp21 and also escapes X inactivation. No evidence
of a Y copy of this gene was found in humans, however. In both humans
and mice, Ehrmann et al. (1998) identified autosomal retroposons of
EIF2G in both humans and mice and an additional retroposon on the X
chromosome in some mouse strains. Ark blot analysis of eutherian and
metatherian genomic DNA indicated that X-Y homologs are present in all
species tested except in simian primates and kangaroo and that
retroposons are common to a wide range of mammals. ('Zoo blots' are
Southern blots of genomic DNA from multiple species without regard to
gender; 'ark blots' are Southern blots used to compare male and female
from multiple species.)

Ehrmann et al. (1998) mapped the human EIF2S3 gene to Xp21 by isotopic
in situ hybridization. The largest number of grains were located on the
region Xp22.2-p22.1. A secondary hybridization repeat was detected on
12p13.2-p12.3. No significant accumulation of grains was detected on the
human Y chromosome.

611411	TITLE *611411 CALCIUM/CALMODULIN-DEPENDENT PROTEIN KINASE KINASE 1, ALPHA; CAMKK1
;;CAMKK-ALPHA; CAMKKA
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CAMKK1 catalyzes the phosphorylation and activation of Ca(2+)/calmodulin
kinase (CaMK) as an upstream component of the CaMK cascade that has been
implicated in neuronal gene transcription, synaptic plasticity, and
long-term memory consolidation (Blaeser et al., 2006).

CLONING

By screening a rat brain cDNA library using partial amino acid sequence
of a 68-kD purified rat brain CaMK kinase, followed by 5-prime RACE,
Tokumitsu et al. (1995) cloned rat Camkk1. The deduced 505-amino acid
protein has a calculated molecular mass of 56 kD. Camkk1 shares 30 to
40% amino acid identity over the catalytic domains of serine/threonine
kinases such as the CaM-kinase family (see CAMK2A; 114078). Camkk1
contains a 22-amino acid proline-, arginine-, and glycine-rich insert
between the ATP-binding motif and DGF kinase motif that is similar to
the insert in yeast Ste11. Northern blot analysis of rat tissues
detected high expression in forebrain, lower expression in cerebellum,
and detectable signal in thymus and spleen.

GENE FUNCTION

Using Western blot analysis or gel overlay, Tokumitsu et al. (1995)
showed that Camkk1 binds calmodulin (CALM1; 114180) and activated Camk4
(114080) with a 6-fold increase in total activity and a 100-fold
increase in Camk4 Ca(2+)-independent activity. Camkk1 catalyzed a
10-fold increase in the total activity of Camk1 (604998) and had no
effect on Camk2 (see CAMK2A; 114078). Cotransfection of COS-7 cells with
Camkk1 and Camk4 resulted in a 14-fold increase in CRE-binding protein
(CREB1; 123810)-dependent transcription compared with Camk4 alone,
suggesting that Camkk1 enhances Camk4-mediated transcriptional
regulation.

Using pharmacologic inhibitors to block potential pathways involved in
cytomegalovirus (CMV)-mediated activation of glycolysis, McArdle et al.
(2011) found that inhibition of CAMKK, but not CAMK2 or protein kinase A
(PKA; see 176911), blocked CMV-mediated glycolysis activation. CMV
infection also induced CAMKK1 mRNA and protein expression. Inhibition of
CAMKK had a negligible impact on CMV immediate-early protein
accumulation, but it severely attenuated production of CMV viral
progeny, reduced expression of 1 early CMV gene, and blocked viral DNA
replication. CAMKK inhibition had no impact on herpes simplex virus
(HSV)-1-induced glycolytic activation and a limited impact on HSV-1
replication. McArdle et al. (2011) concluded that CAMKK has a role that
is CMV specific and that it is an important factor in both CMV
replication and glycolytic activation.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the CAMKK1
gene to chromosome 17 (TMAP SHGC-32989).

ANIMAL MODEL

Blaeser et al. (2006) generated mice with targeted disruption of Camkk1
and carried out a variety of behavioral and learning and memory tests.
Mutant mice exhibited normal long-term spatial memory, cued fear memory,
basal synaptic transmission, and long-term potentiation. However, mutant
mice displayed deficient long-term contextual fear memory, as measured
in the post-shock freezing response. Mutant mice displayed decreased
stress-induced anxiety-like behavior; however, other measures of anxiety
such as the elevated plus maze and open field tests showed no difference
from wildtype. Blaeser et al. (2006) concluded that Camkk1 plays a
selective role in contextual fear memory. They showed that mice lacking
Camkk1 displayed decreased phosphorylation and activation of Camk4 and
Creb in specific brain areas involved in contextual fear memory
formation.

300522	TITLE *300522 IQ MOTIF- AND SEC7 DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 2; IQSEC2
;;KIAA0522
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The IQSEC2 gene encodes a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the ARF
family of GTP-binding proteins (see, e.g., ARF1; 103180) (Shoubridge et
al., 2010).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) cloned IQSEC2, which they designated
KIAA0522. The deduced 1,560-amino acid protein shares weak homology with
rat Sec7a. RT-PCR detected high expression of IQSEC2 in brain, kidney,
and small intestine, and intermediate to low expression in placenta,
pancreas, ovary, prostate, and liver. No expression was detected in
other tissues examined.

Shoubridge et al. (2010) characterized 2 isoforms of the IQSEC2 gene
that are generated by alternative splicing. The longer isoform contains
15 exons and encodes a 1,488-residue protein, whereas the shorter
isoform contains 14 exons and encodes a 949-residue protein. The
proteins have 906 amino acids in common, which include the IQ, Sec7, and
PH functional domains, but vary at both the N and C termini. An
alternative transcript for the longer isoform, resulting in a
1,478-residue protein, was also proposed. Both the long and short
isoforms were expressed in fetal and adult human brain.

GENE FUNCTION

Filippova et al. (2005) determined that the mouse Iqsec2 gene is subject
to X inactivation, but human IQSEC2 escapes X inactivation. They
attributed this difference to the presence of a CTCF (604167)-binding
site at the 5-prime end of the upstream Jarid1c gene (314690) in mice
that is not present in humans.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the IQSEC2
gene to chromosome X. Filippova et al. (2005) noted that the mouse
Iqsec2 gene also maps to chromosome X. In both mice and humans, the
IQSEC2 gene lies between the JARID1C and SMC1A (300040) genes.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of 4 unrelated families with X-linked nonsyndromic
mental retardation (MRX1; 309530), Shoubridge et al. (2010) identified 4
different hemizygous mutations in the IQSEC2 gene
(300522.0001-300522.0004). Some carrier females had learning
disabilities. The authors suggested that a defect in the GTP-binding
activity of mutant IQSEC2 may influence the regulation of actin
cytoskeleton organization and neuronal development in the brain.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MENTAL RETARDATION, X-LINKED 1
IQSEC2, ARG863TRP

In affected members of a family with X-linked mental retardation 1
(MRX1; 309530) reported by Suthers et al. (1988), Shoubridge et al.
(2010) identified a 2587C-T transition in exon 8 of the IQSEC2 gene,
resulting in an arg863-to-trp (R863W) substitution affecting a conserved
residue in the Sec7 domain. The mutation was not found in 1,310 control
individuals. In vitro functional expression studies showed that the
mutant protein had significantly decreased GTP binding to ARF6 (600464)
compared to wildtype.

In affected members of a family with X-linked mental retardation 18 (see
309530 and Gedeon et al., 1994), Shoubridge et al. (2010) identified a
2402A-C transversion in exon 6 of the IQSEC2 gene, resulting in a
gln801-to-pro (Q801P) substitution affecting a conserved residue in the
Sec7 domain. The mutation was not found in 1,310 control individuals. In
vitro functional expression studies showed that the mutant protein had
significantly decreased GTP binding to ARF6 (600464) compared to
wildtype.

exon 5 of the IQSEC2 gene, resulting in an arg758-to-gln (R758Q)
substitution affecting a conserved residue in the Sec7 domain. The
mutation was not found in 1,310 control individuals. In vitro functional
expression studies showed that the mutant protein had significantly
decreased GTP binding to ARF6 (600464) compared to wildtype.

In affected members of an Australian family with X-linked mental
retardation (309530), Shoubridge et al. (2010) identified a 1075C-T
transition in exon 4 of the IQSEC2 gene, resulting in an arg359-to-cys
(R359C) substitution affecting a conserved residue in the IQ-like
domain. The mutation was not found in 1,310 control individuals. In
vitro functional expression studies showed that the mutant protein
resulted in a decrease of GTP-bound ARF6 (600464).

607977	TITLE *607977 HEADCASE, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF; HECA
;;HDC
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

HECA is a homolog of the Drosophila 'headcase' protein (hdc). In
Drosophila, hdc is required for adult development and is an inhibitor of
epithelial sprouting and branching morphogenesis.

CLONING

By searching an EST database and screening cDNA libraries to identify
genes located in a region of chromosome 6q that is commonly deleted in
pancreatic cancers, Makino et al. (2001) cloned HECA, which they called
HDC. The deduced protein contains 543 amino acids and the transcript has
a long 3-prime untranslated region. HECA shares 40% identity over 320
amino acids with Drosophila hdc. Northern blot analysis detected
ubiquitous expression of a 5.6-kb transcript.

GENE FUNCTION

Makino et al. (2001) found low expression of HECA in 17 of 21 (81%)
pancreatic cancer cell lines and in 4 of 5 (80%) renal cell carcinoma
cell lines.

GENE STRUCTURE

Makino et al. (2001) determined that the HECA gene contains 4 exons. The
last exon is large and contains an Alu repeat in the 3-prime
untranslated region in the opposite strand.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Makino et al. (2001) mapped the HECA gene
to chromosome 6q24.
