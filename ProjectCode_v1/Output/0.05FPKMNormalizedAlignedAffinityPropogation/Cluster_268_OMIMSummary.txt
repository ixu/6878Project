DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The PDGFRB gene encodes platelet-derived growth factor receptor-beta, a
cell surface tyrosine kinase receptor for members of the
platelet-derived growth factor family (see, e.g., PDFGB, 190040).
Activation of the receptor leads to activation of downstream signaling
pathways, inducing cellular proliferation, differentiation, survival,
and migration (summary by Nicolas et al., 2013).

See also PDGFRA (173490).

CLONING

Stimulation of cell proliferation of the receptor for PDGF (190040) has
been implicated in atherogenesis and in cell transformation by the SIS
oncogene. Escobedo et al. (1986) sequenced the receptor and cloned its
gene.

Gronwald et al. (1988) cloned a cDNA coding for human PDGFR and studied
its expression. The cDNA contained an open reading frame that coded for
a protein of 1,106 amino acids. In transfectants, Gronwald et al. (1988)
found that the PDGFR clone expressed a high affinity receptor specific
for the BB isoform of PDGF, i.e., PDGF dimers composed of 2 B chains.
There may be a separate class of PDGF receptor that binds both the
homodimers and the heterodimer.

Claesson-Welsh et al. (1988) determined the structure of the human PDGF
receptor as deduced from a full-length cDNA clone. The receptor
expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells was found to bind specifically
to B-chain-containing PDGF molecules (190040). With the description of a
second PDGF receptor (173490), it is necessary to use the symbol PDGFR1.
Matsui et al. (1989) designated the second type of PDGFR as type alpha
because PDGF binding was blocked by AA as well as BB isoforms of the
ligand; the product of the earlier cloned PDGF receptor was termed type
beta.

The PDFGRB gene is expressed in pericytes in the developing vascular
walls of mouse brain (Lindahl et al., 1997). It is expressed
particularly in the basal ganglia and dentate nucleus of the cerebellum
(summary by Nicolas et al., 2013).

GENE FUNCTION

Di Pasquale et al. (2003) characterized 43 cell lines as permissive or
nonpermissive for adeno-associated virus type 5 (AAV-5) transduction and
compared the gene expression profiles derived from cDNA microarray
analyses of those cell lines. A statistically significant correlation
was observed between expression of PDGFR-alpha (173490) and AAV-5
transduction. Subsequent experiments confirmed the role of PDGFR-alpha
and PDGFR-beta as receptors for AAV-5.

Gilbertson and Clifford (2003) presented data confirming that PDGFRB is
preferentially expressed in metastatic medulloblastoma (155255) and
suggested that it may prove useful as a prognostic marker and as a
therapeutic target for the disease.

Svegliati Baroni et al. (2006) presented evidence showing that
stimulatory autoantibodies to PDGFR are a specific hallmark of
scleroderma (181750). These antibodies appeared to trigger an
intracellular loop that involves Ras (190020), ERK1 (601795)/ERK2
(176948), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) and that leads to increased
type I collagen (120150) expression. The authors suggested that the
biologic activity of PDGFR antibodies on fibroblasts has a causal role
in the pathogenesis of the disease. Tan (2006) suggested that the
profibrotic phenotype of fibroblasts in patients with scleroderma is
maintained by at least 3 mechanisms involving TGFB1 (190180), PDGFR, and
the Ras-ERK1/ERK2-ROS cascade.

Greenberg et al. (2008) defined a role for VEGF (192240) as an inhibitor
of neovascularization on the basis of its capacity to disrupt vascular
smooth muscle cell function. Specifically, under conditions of
PDGF-mediated angiogenesis, VEGF ablates pericyte coverage of nascent
vascular sprouts, leading to vessel destabilization. At the molecular
level, VEGF-mediated activation of VEGFR2 (191306) suppresses PDGFRB
signaling in vascular smooth muscle cells through the assembly of a
receptor complex consisting of PDGFRB and VEGFR2. Inhibition of VEGFR2
not only prevents assembly of this receptor complex but also restores
angiogenesis in tissues exposed to both VEGF and PDGF. Finally, genetic
deletion of tumor cell VEGF disrupts PDGFRB/VEGFR2 complex formation and
increases tumor vessel maturation. Greenberg et al. (2008) concluded
that their findings underscored the importance of vascular smooth muscle
cells/pericytes in neovascularization and revealed a dichotomous role
for VEGF and VEGFR2 signaling as both a promoter of endothelial cell
function and a negative regulator of vascular smooth muscle cells and
vessel maturation.

Nazarian et al. (2010) showed that acquired resistance of BRAF(V600E)
(164757.0001)-positive melanomas to PLX4032, a novel class I
RAF-selective inhibitor, develops by mutually exclusive PDGFRB
upregulation or NRAS (164790) mutations but not through secondary
mutations in BRAF(V600E). Nazarian et al. (2010) used PLX4032-resistant
sublines artificially derived from BRAF(V600E)-positive melanoma cell
lines and validated key findings in PLX4032-resistant tumors and
tumor-matched, short-term cultures from clinical trial patients.
Induction of PDGFRB RNA, protein, and tyrosine phosphorylation emerged
as a dominant feature of acquired PLX4032 resistance in a subset of
melanoma sublines, patient-derived biopsies, and short-term cultures.
PDGFRB-upregulated tumor cells had low activated RAS levels and, when
treated with PLX4032, did not reactivate the MAPK (see 176872) pathway
significantly. In another subset, high levels of activated NRAS
resulting from mutations led to significant MAPK pathway reactivation
upon PLX4032 treatment. Knockdown of PDGFRB or NRAS reduced growth of
the respective PLX4032-resistant subsets. Overexpression of PDGFRB or
mutated NRAS conferred PLX4032 resistance to PLX4032-sensitive parental
cell lines. Importantly, Nazarian et al. (2010) showed that MAPK
reactivation predicts MEK inhibitor sensitivity. Thus, Nazarian et al.
(2010) concluded that melanomas escape BRAF(V600E) targeting not through
secondary BRAF(V600E) mutations but via receptor tyrosine kinase
(RTK)-mediated activation of alternative survival pathway(s) or
activated RAS-mediated reactivation of the MAPK pathway, suggesting
additional therapeutic strategies.

MAPPING

By Southern blotting of DNA from somatic cell hybrids and by in situ
hybridization, Francke et al. (1986) mapped the gene for PDGFR to
5q31-q32. The gene is flanked proximally by GMCSF (138960) and distally
by FMS (164770). All 3 loci may be implicated in the 5q- syndrome
(153550). See also Yarden et al. (1986). Buchberg et al. (1989) cited
unpublished observations indicating that Pdgfr is located on mouse
chromosome 18.

The Treacher Collins Syndrome Collaborative Group (1996) determined that
the PDGFRB gene is located within approximately 900 kb proximal of the
TCOF1 gene (606847).

The PDGFRB gene and the CSF1R gene (164770) encode proteins that belong
to the same subfamily of receptor tyrosine kinases (Yarden and Ullrich,
1988). Both genes are located on 5q and are linked physically in a
head-to-tail array with less than 500 bp between the polyadenylation
signal of the PDGFRB gene and the transcription start point of the CSF1R
gene (Roberts et al., 1988). (This finding is inconsistent with the
conclusion that the PDGFRB gene is located at 5q31-q32 and the presumed
assignment of CSF1R to 5q33.2-q33.3. One of the assignments must be in
error.) Close linkage of the 2 genes has been demonstrated also in the
mouse and How et al. (1996) demonstrated that in the pufferfish (Fugu
rubripes) the 2 genes are linked tandemly in a head-to-tail array with
2.2 kb of intragenic sequence.

Gross (2013) mapped the PDGFRB gene to chromosome 5q32 based on an
alignment of the PDGFRB sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC032224) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

CYTOGENETICS

- PDGFRB Fusion Genes

Abe et al. (1997) reported that in a patient with acute myelogenous
leukemia (AML; 601626), the TRIP11 gene (604505), which they called
CEV14, was fused to the PDGFRB gene as a result of a t(5;14)(q33;q32)
translocation. On initial diagnosis, this patient had exhibited a sole
t(7;11) translocation, but the t(5;14)(q33;q32) translocation appeared
during the relapse phase. The CEV14-PDGFRB chimeric gene consisted of
the 5-prime region of CEV14 fused to the 3-prime region of PDGFRB.

Apperley et al. (2002) noted that a small proportion of patients with
chronic myeloproliferative disorders have constitutive activation of the
PDGFRB gene, resulting in many cases from a chromosome translocation
such as t(5;12), which creates a fusion gene with ETV6 (600618). Fusions
between PDGFRB and H4/D10S170 (601985), rabaptin-5 (RABPT5; 603616), and
huntingtin-interacting protein-1 (HIP1; 601767) have also been reported
in cases of chronic myeloproliferative disorders. The protein tyrosine
kinase activity of PDGFRB, like that of ABL1 (189980) and KIT (164920),
is inhibited by imatinib mesylate. The compound has been shown to be
effective in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (151410) and
gastrointestinal stromal tumors (606764), which are caused by
abnormalities in the ABL1 and KIT genes, respectively. Apperley et al.
(2002) demonstrated that imatinib mesylate was also effective in the
treatment of chronic myeloproliferative disorders with rearrangements of
the PDGFRB gene. Three of 4 patients presented with leukocytosis and
eosinophilia (see 131440), and their leukemia cells carried the
ETV6-PDGFRB fusion gene.

Steer and Cross (2002) reviewed the acquired reciprocal chromosomal
translocations that involve 5q31-q33 and are associated with a
significant minority of patients with BCR-ABL-negative chronic myeloid
leukemias. The most common of these fuses the ETV6 gene to the PDGFRB
gene, but at the time of the review 4 additional partner genes were
known: H4 (D10S170), HIP1, CEV14 (TRIP11), and rabaptin-5. Clinically,
most patients present with a myeloproliferative disorder with
eosinophilia, eosinophilic leukemia, or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia
and thus fall into the broad category of myeloproliferative
disorders/myelodysplastic syndromes (MPD/MDS). With the advent of
targeted signal transduction therapy, patients with rearrangement of
PDGFRB might be better classified as a distinct subgroup of MPD/MDS.

In 9 patients with BCR-ABL-negative chronic myeloproliferative disorders
or MPD/MDS, Baxter et al. (2003) described translocations involving
chromosome bands 5q31 or 5q33, resulting in fusion of the PDGFRB gene
with other genes. They commented that several PDGFRB partner genes
remained to be characterized.

Pierce et al. (2008) showed that expression of TEL/PDGFRB in murine
myeloid FDCP-Mix cells prevented cell differentiation, increased cell
survival, increased the level of phosphatidylinositol
3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdInsP3), and increased the expression and
phosphorylation of Thoc5 (612733). Elevated Thoc5 expression also led to
increased cell survival and PtdInsP3 levels, suggesting that the effects
associated with TEL/PDGFRB expression were due, at least in part, to
Thoc5 upregulation.

Walz et al. (2009) reported a 51-year-old male with imatinib-responsive
eosinophilia associated with atypical myeloproliferative neoplasm who
presented with a t(5;17)(q33-34;q11.2). The translocation resulted in
the fusion of MYO18A (610067) intron 40 to PDGFRB intron 9, and RT-PCR
confirmed in-frame fusion between MYO18A exon 40 and PDGFRB exon 10. The
predicted 2,661-amino acid chimeric protein contains almost all of the
MYO18A sequence fused to the PDGFRB transmembrane, WW-like, and kinase
domains. RT-PCR also detected the reciprocal PDGFRB-MYO18A transcript,
with PDGFRB exon 9 fused to MYO18A exon 41.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Idiopathic Basal Ganglia Calcification 4

In affected members of a large 3-generation family with idiopathic basal
ganglia calcification-4 (IBGC4; 615007), Nicolas et al. (2013)
identified a heterozygous mutation in the PDGFRB gene (L658P;
173410.0001). The mutation, which was identified by exome sequencing of
2 affected individuals and confirmed by Sanger sequencing, segregated
with the disorder in this family and was not found in several large
exome databases. Many mutation carriers were asymptomatic, but 1 had
late-onset parkinsonism and dementia, and several had depression or
migraine. Nicolas et al. (2013) noted that animal models have shown a
key role for Pdgfrb in the development of pericytes in vessels within
the brain, and that pericytes have a key role in maintaining the
integrity of the blood-brain barrier, which is hypothesized to be
impaired in IBGC. In addition, the PDGFB-PDGFRB pathway appears to be
involved in phosphate-induced calcifications in vascular smooth muscle
cells by modulating expression of the phosphate transporter SLC20A1
(137570) (Villa-Bellosta et al., 2009); IGBC3 (614540) is caused by
mutation in a related phosphate transporter SLC20A2 (158378). These
findings suggest that cerebral phosphate homeostasis may play a role in
vascular calcifications.

- Infantile Myofibromatosis 1

In affected members of 4 unrelated families with infantile
myofibromatosis-1 (IMF1; 228550), Cheung et al. (2013) identified the
same heterozygous missense mutation in the PDGFRB gene (R561C;
173410.0003). The families were of Chinese, European, French Canadian,
and French origin, respectively. The mutation, which was identified by
exome sequencing and confirmed by Sanger sequencing in the first 2
families, segregated with the phenotype in all families and was not
found in several large control databases. In addition, tumor tissue from
1 of the patients who carried a germline R561C mutation harbored an
additional somatic PDGFRB mutation (N666K) that was predicted to be
damaging. Structural modeling indicated that the R561C mutation occurs
in the cytoplasmic juxtamembrane (JM) region between the helical
transmembrane segment and the kinase domain, and was predicted to
compromise the autoinhibitory role of the JM domain, leading to
increased kinase firing and promoting the formation of myofibromas in
tissues with high PDGFRB signaling activity. Modeling also predicted
that the N666K mutation would favor an active kinase formation. In vitro
functional studies were not performed. Sequencing the PDGFRB gene in 5
individuals with nonfamilial IMF did not identify any causative
mutations.

Martignetti et al. (2013) identified a heterozygous R561C mutation in
the PDGFRB gene in affected members from 7 unrelated families with
autosomal dominant infantile myofibromatosis. The mutation, which was
identified by exome sequencing and confirmed by Sanger sequencing,
segregated with the disorder and was not found in several large control
databases. Another family with the disorder carried a different
heterozygous mutation in the PDGFRB gene (P660T; 173410.0004).

ANIMAL MODEL

Klinghoffer et al. (2001) created 2 complementary lines of knockin mice
in which the intracellular signaling domains of one PDGFR had been
removed and replaced by those of the other PDGFR. While both lines
demonstrated substantial rescue of normal development, substitution of
the Pdgfrb signaling domains with those of Pdgfra resulted in varying
degrees of vascular disease.

Armulik et al. (2010) demonstrated a direct role of pericytes at the
blood-brain barrier in vivo. Using a set of adult viable
pericyte-deficient mouse mutants, they showed that pericyte deficiency
increases the permeability of the blood-brain barrier to water and a
range of low molecular mass and high molecular mass tracers. The
increased permeability occurs by endothelial transcytosis, a process
that is rapidly arrested by the drug imatinib. Furthermore, Armulik et
al. (2010) showed that pericytes function at the blood-brain barrier in
at least 2 ways: by regulating blood-brain barrier-specific gene
expression patterns in endothelial cells, and by inducing polarization
of astrocyte end-feet surrounding central nervous system (CNS) blood
vessels. Armulik et al. (2010) concluded that their results indicated a
novel and critical role for pericytes in the integration of endothelial
and astrocyte functions at the neurovascular unit, and in the regulation
of the blood-brain barrier.

Daneman et al. (2010) independently showed that the blood-brain barrier
is formed during embryogenesis as endothelial cells invade the CNS and
pericytes are recruited to the nascent vessels, over a week before
astrocyte generation. Analyzing mice with null and hypomorphic alleles
of Pdgfrb, which have defects in pericyte generation, they demonstrated
that pericytes are necessary for the formation of the blood-brain
barrier, and that absolute pericyte coverage determines relative
vascular permeability. Daneman et al. (2010) demonstrated that pericytes
regulate functional aspects of the blood-brain barrier, including the
formation of tight junctions and vesicle trafficking in CNS endothelial
cells. Pericytes do not induce blood-brain barrier-specific gene
expression in CNS endothelial cells, but inhibit the expression of
molecules that increase vascular permeability and CNS immune cell
infiltration. Daneman et al. (2010) concluded that pericyte-endothelial
cell interactions are critical to regulate the blood-brain barrier
during development, and that disruption of these interactions may lead
to blood-brain barrier dysfunction and neuroinflammation during CNS
injury and disease.

kinase domain. The mutation, which was identified by exome sequencing
and confirmed by Sanger sequencing, segregated with the disorder and was
found at very low frequency (0.000077) in control databases (dbSNP
rs144050370). In vitro functional studies were not performed.

148030	TITLE *148030 KERATIN 15; KRT15
;;CYTOKERATIN 15;;
K15
DESCRIPTION Keratins are a family of structurally related proteins that form
intermediate filaments in epithelial cells. Keratins can be divided into
2 subfamilies: acidic (type I) and basic (type II). A comparison of the
amino acid and nucleotide sequences corresponding to different keratin
polypeptides shows a constant principle of organization, namely, a
conserved central rod of coiled-coil alpha-helical arrangement of 300 to
330 amino acids flanked by head and tail regions of highly variable
sizes. Sequence homologies are restricted to the alpha-helical core
portion. Members of the acidic subfamily display little, if any, amino
acid homology to polypeptides of the basic one. Although in vitro any of
the 10 to 15 acidic polypeptides is able to associate with any of the
basic ones, the composition of the keratin pairs found in vivo is highly
specific. For example, the basal cells of human epidermis express 2
keratin subunits, acidic keratin 14 (K14; 148066) and basic keratin 5
(K5; 148040), whereas suprabasal cells committed to terminal
differentiation express acidic keratin 10 (K10; 148080) and basic
keratin 1 (K1; 139350).

Hanukoglu and Fuchs (1982) sequenced a cloned cDNA complementary to the
mRNA for the 50-kilodalton human epidermal keratin.

Marchuk et al. (1985) reported the complete nucleotide sequence for a
gene encoding the 50-kD keratin expressed in abundance in human
epidermal cells. (Keratin represents almost 30% of the protein
synthesized in basal epidermal cells.) The gene appears to have a single
transcriptional initiation site and a single polyadenylation signal.
Upstream, 3 regulatory sequences sharing homology with viral and
immunoglobulin enhancer elements were found. Types I and II (Fuchs et
al., 1981) represent the 2 distinct sequence classes of the 20
polypeptides which comprise 8 nm cytoplasmic filaments in most, if not
all, epithelial cells. Although the sequences of the 2 classes differ,
their secondary structures are very similar. At least 1 member of each
of the 2 keratin classes is expressed in all tissues, suggesting the
importance of the 2 types of sequences in filament assembly.
RayChaudhury et al. (1986) rejected the suggestion that different
keratin mRNAs may arise by differential processing of a small number of
heterogeneous nuclear RNA transcripts. They also isolated 3 separate
type I keratin genes and showed that they are physically tightly linked.
They appear to be separate from the previously sequenced type I keratin
gene referred to as K14 (Marchuk et al., 1985).

Blumenberg and Savtchenko (1986) proposed that the human genome contains
at least 20 genes for keratin proteins. In epithelial intermediate
filaments, keratins from both families appear to be coordinately
expressed.

In the mouse, basic or beta-keratin is coded by chromosome 11 in a
segment near the Hox-2 gene (Nadeau et al., 1989); thus, it may be that
the corresponding gene in man is linked to HOX2 (142960). This would
place the basic keratin gene in the segment 17q11-q22. In the mouse, a
mutation that affects the development of hair ('Rex') is also closely
linked to Hox-2 (Nadeau et al., 1989). The close linkage of several
genes for type I keratins, including the epidermal keratin K10, to the
rex locus with no crossovers in 239 opportunities suggests that the
mutation responsible for rex may be in a type I keratin gene.

Using a cDNA probe in the analysis of a panel of human-hamster cell
hybrids, Romano et al. (1987) mapped the gene for what they termed
cytokeratin 13 to chromosome 17; later, Romano et al. (1988) revised the
identification of the gene they studied and referred to it as
cytokeratin 15. Barletta et al. (1989, 1990) showed by in situ
hybridization that cytokeratin 15 is localized to human chromosome
17q21-q23. Rosenberg et al. (1988) determined that 2 genes encoding K16
(148067) and 3 genes encoding K14 are clustered in 2 distinct segments
of chromosome 17. The genes within each cluster were found to be tightly
linked. By in situ hybridization, 1 cluster of genes was located at band
17p12-p11 and a second at band 17q12-q21. Small clusters of grains were
also noted on the long arm of chromosome 14 at bands q31-q32 and on the
long arm of chromosome 21. These may have represented sites of more
distantly related keratin genes. The clustering of the K16 and K14 genes
is of interest in light of their coordinate expression. Savtchenko et
al. (1990) demonstrated physical linkage of 3 groups of acidic keratin
genes. Romano et al. (1991) demonstrated that the KRT10, KRT13 (148065),
and KRT15 genes are located in the same large pulsed field gel
electrophoresis fragment. A correlation of assignments of the 3 genes
makes 17q21-q22 the likely location of the cluster.

Compton (1994) gave an enumeration of the known keratin mutations.

601918	TITLE *601918 GROWTH/DIFFERENTIATION FACTOR 9; GDF9
DESCRIPTION Growth factors synthesized by ovarian somatic cells directly affect
oocyte growth and function. Incerti et al. (1994) described the
structure of the mouse Gdf9 gene. Gdf9 mRNA is synthesized only in the
oocyte from the primary 1-layer follicle stage until after ovulation.
McGrath et al. (1995) used in situ hybridization methods to show that
Gdf9 mRNA is expressed exclusively in mouse oocytes at all stages of
follicular development, except in primordial follicles, in both neonatal
and adult ovaries. Expression continued after ovulation but disappeared
1.5 days after fertilization. McGrath et al. (1995) also isolated the
human homolog of the gene (GDF9) whose amino acid sequence shares 90%
identity with the mouse protein in the mature C-terminal portion of the
molecule.

Dong et al. (1996) showed that Gdf9, a member of the transforming growth
factor-beta superfamily, is required for ovarian folliculogenesis. They
analyzed ovaries from female mice deficient in Gdf9 and demonstrated
that primordial and primary 1-layer follicles could be formed, but there
was a block in follicular development beyond the primary 1-layer
follicle stage that led to complete infertility. Oocyte growth and zona
pellucida formation proceeded normally, but other aspects of oocyte
differentiation were compromised. Thus, the investigators concluded that
Gdf9 is the first oocyte-derived growth factor shown to be required for
somatic cell function in vivo.

Aaltonen et al. (1999) determined the localization of the GDF9 mRNA and
protein during human folliculogenesis by in situ hybridization and
immunohistochemical analyses and compared it with that of GDF9B
(300247). GDF9 transcripts were not detected in primordial follicles but
were abundantly expressed in primary follicles in frozen sections of
ovarian cortical tissue obtained at laparoscopic surgery. Human GDF9B
transcripts could be detected only in the gonads by RT-PCR analysis, and
in situ hybridization studies indicated that GDF9B is not expressed in
small primary follicles but rather in the oocytes of late primary
follicles. The authors concluded that 1) both GDF9 mRNA and protein are
abundantly expressed in oocytes of primary follicles in human ovary,
suggesting that the GDF9 transcript is translated at this early stage of
folliculogenesis; 2) human GDF9B is specifically expressed in gonads at
low levels; 3) expression of GDF9 mRNA begins slightly earlier than that
of GDF9B in human oocytes during follicular development; and 4) the
results are consistent with the suggestion that GDF9 and GDF9B regulate
human folliculogenesis in a manner specific to the ovary.

Filho et al. (2002) compared the pattern and level of expression of GDF9
and BMP15 (300247) mRNA in ovaries from 12 normal-cycling, 5 polycystic
ovary syndrome (PCOS; 184700), and 7 polycystic ovary (PCO) individuals.
In situ hybridization studies showed that expression of GDF9 and BMP15
was restricted to oocytes in all ovaries examined. A decreased level of
GDF9 signal was observed in developing PCOS and PCO oocytes, compared
with normal. This difference was evident throughout folliculogenesis,
beginning at recruitment initiation and continuing through the small
Graafian follicle stage. The results indicated that the expression of
GDF9 mRNA is delayed and reduced in PCOS and PCO oocytes during their
growth and differentiation phase. Because oocyte-derived GDF9 is crucial
for normal folliculogenesis and female fertility, the authors suggested
that a dysregulation of oocyte GDF9 expression may contribute to
aberrant folliculogenesis in PCOS and PCO women.

Palmer et al. (2006) studied the frequency of rare variants in GDF9 in
families with a history of dizygotic (DZ) twinning. They recruited 3,450
individuals from 915 DZ twinning families (1,693 mothers of twins) and
1,512 controls of Caucasian origin. DNA samples from 279 mothers of DZ
twins were screened for rare variants in GDF9 using denaturant high
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Palmer et al. (2006) found 2
novel insertion/deletions and 4 missense alterations in the GDF9
sequence in mothers of twins. Two of the missense variants were located
in the proregion of GDF9, and 2 were in the mature protein region. For
each variant, the frequencies were higher in cases compared with
controls. The proportion of mothers of DZ twins carrying any variant
(4.12%) was significantly higher (P less than 0.0001) than the
proportion of carriers in controls (2.29%).

603039	TITLE *603039 MAX-BINDING PROTEIN; MNT
;;ROX
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Proteins of the MYC (190080) and MAD (600021) family are involved in
transcriptional regulation and mediate cell differentiation and
proliferation. These molecules share a basic helix-loop-helix leucine
zipper domain (bHLHZip) and bind DNA at the E box (CANNTG) consensus by
forming heterodimers with MAX (154950). MYC-MAX complexes activate
transcription, while MAD-MAX complexes repress transcription through
recruitment of the SIN3 corepressor (see 607776). Meroni et al. (1997)
identified the human ROX gene, a new member of the bHLHZip family, as a
transcribed sequence from 17p13.3 and isolated human fetal brain ROX
cDNAs. The deduced 582-amino acid human ROX protein shares 88.5%
identity with the 591-amino acid mouse Rox. In vitro translated ROX
protein has a molecular mass of 70 kD. The authors showed that ROX is a
nuclear protein that heterodimerizes with MAX and binds the E box with
its bHLHZip domain. ROX repressed transcription in both human HEK293
cells and yeast; repression in yeast was through interaction between its
N terminus and the Sin3 corepressor. The authors demonstrated that ROX
is highly expressed in quiescent fibroblasts and that expression is
decreased when cells enter the cell cycle. Northern blot analysis
detected a 4.8-kb ROX transcript in all human tissues examined.

GENE FUNCTION

By searching for proteins that interact with Max in a yeast 2-hybrid
system, Hurlin et al. (1997) isolated mouse cDNAs encoding Mnt. They
found that Mnt-Max heterodimers act as transcriptional repressors of E
box promoters and that repression by Mnt maps to the Sin3-interaction
domain (SID). Wildtype Mnt suppressed Myc+Ras cotransformation of
primary cells, while a Mnt protein containing a SID deletion cooperated
with Ras in the absence of Myc to transform cells. Hurlin et al. (1997)
detected expression of Mnt mRNA in both proliferating and
differentiating cells, and in a wide range of embryonic cell types
together with Nmyc (164840) and Myc mRNAs. They also found that Mnt-Max
and Myc-Max heterocomplexes coexist in proliferating cell populations.
Transgenic mice expressing Mnt under the control of the beta-actin
(102630) promoter exhibited a delay in development and appeared to die
between days 8.5 and 10.5 of gestation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lo Nigro et al. (1998) determined that the human ROX gene contains 6
exons and spans less than 40 kb. Using single-stranded conformational
polymorphism analysis of the ROX coding region in 16 sporadic breast
cancers showing loss of heterozygosity at 17p13.3, they were unable to
find mutations in the nondeleted allele of ROX. Polymorphic proteins
identified in this study showed no significant decreases in their
abilities to bind DNA or to repress transcription.

MAPPING

Meroni et al. (1997) identified the human ROX gene as a transcribed
sequence from chromosome 17p13.3. They mapped the mouse Rox gene to
chromosome 11, in a region showing homology of synteny with the location
of the human ROX gene.

ANIMAL MODEL

Toyo-oka et al. (2004) produced knockout mice for MAX-binding protein
(Mnt). Virtually all homozygote mutants in a mixed (129S6 x NIH Black
Swiss) or inbred (129S6) genetic background died perinatally.
Mnt-deficient embryos exhibited small size throughout development and
showed reduced levels of c-Myc (190080) and N-Myc (164840). In addition,
37% of mixed-background mutants displayed cleft palate as well as
retardation of skull development, a phenotype not observed in the inbred
mutants. The authors proposed an important role for Mnt in embryonic
development and survival, and suggested that Mnt may play a role in the
craniofacial defects displayed by patients with Miller-Dieker syndrome
(247200).

172280	TITLE *172280 PHOSPHOGLYCOLATE PHOSPHATASE; PGP
DESCRIPTION This enzyme (EC 3.1.3.18) may have an important regulatory influence on
oxygen transport in man by indirectly affecting the level of red cell
2,3-diphosphoglycerate. (The spellings 'phosphoglycolate' and
'phosphoglycollate' have been used interchangeably, but the former is
preferred.) Barker and Hopkinson (1978) devised a method for detecting
PGP isozymes after starch-gel electrophoresis. They are present in all
human tissues, with highest activities in skeletal and cardiac muscle.
Six different electrophoretic phenotypes were identified. Family studies
showed that these are determined by 3 alleles at an autosomal locus. In
a sample of Europeans, the frequency of the alleles were PGP(1), 0.826;
PGP(2), 0.129; PGP(3), 0.045. The 3-banded isozyme pattern in
heterozygotes suggested that the enzyme is dimeric.

The phosphoglycolate phosphatase locus was assigned to chromosome 16 by
Donald et al. (1979) and by Blankenstein-Wijnen et al. (1979). Family
data suggested that PGP is not close to 16qh or alpha-haptoglobin (Povey
et al., 1980). The most likely regional assignment was considered to be
16p13 or 16p12, but a site on 16q could not be excluded (Povey et al.,
1980). Koeffler et al. (1981) assigned the PGP locus to 16p by mouse-man
somatic cell hybridization. Bale et al. (1984) suggested the existence
of recombination heterogeneity in the linkage with haptoglobin. Reeders
et al. (1986) showed that the PGP locus is, like the alpha-globin locus,
close to the adult polycystic kidney disease locus (maximum lod = 8.21,
theta = 0.00). PGP versus the 3-prime-HVR (hypervariable region 3-prime
to the alpha-globin locus) gave a maximum lod score of 11.61 at theta =
0.00. Thus, PGP, HBA, and APCKD are all close together on 16p. Mulley et
al. (1990) assigned the PGP gene to 16p13.3 by electrophoretic detection
of enzymes from a human/mouse somatic cell panel, the members of which
carried portions of human chromosome 16 with precisely defined
breakpoints. Eiberg et al. (1993) reported a suggestion of linkage
between manic-depressive illness (125480) and PGP; a maximum lod score
of 2.20 at 0% recombination was found in a single large family. A second
family was uninformative.

Data on gene frequencies of allelic variants were tabulated by
Roychoudhury and Nei (1988).

610195	TITLE *610195 PROSTATE TUMOR OVEREXPRESSED GENE 1; PTOV1
;;ACTIVATOR INTERACTION DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 2; ACID2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using differential display to identify genes upregulated in prostate
tumors, followed by database analysis and RT-PCR, Benedit et al. (2001)
cloned PTOV1. The deduced 416-amino acid protein consists almost
entirely of 2 tandemly arranged blocks that share 66% identity and are
joined by a short linker sequence. PTOV1 was predicted to form
alternating alpha helices and beta sheets. Northern blot analysis
detected a 1.8-kb transcript abundantly expressed in brain, heart,
skeletal muscle, kidney, and liver. Normal prostate expressed low PTOV1
levels. Western blot analysis of prostate tumor tissue detected PTOV1 at
an apparent molecular mass of 58 kD. Immunocytochemical analysis
detected endogenous PTOV1 in the cytoplasm, concentrated around the
nucleus.

GENE FUNCTION

Benedit et al. (2001) found that PTOV1 was overexpressed in 9 of 11
prostate tumor samples. It was markedly overexpressed in foci of
prostate tumors with malignant morphology, and it was modestly elevated,
but with a homogeneous distribution, in morphologically normal cells
located in benign peripheral zones of the same tumors. In a human
prostate carcinoma cell line, expression of PTOV1 increased following
exposure to 5-alpha-dihydroxytestosterone.

By immunohistochemical analysis, Santamaria et al. (2003) found that
PTOV1 was overexpressed in 71% of 38 prostate carcinomas and in 80% of
samples with prostate intraepithelial neoplasia. High levels of PTOV1 in
tumors correlated significantly with proliferative index and
localization of PTOV1 in the nucleus. In quiescent cultured prostate
tumor cells, PTOV1 localized to the cytoplasm and was excluded from
nuclei. After serum stimulation, PTOV1 partially translocated to the
nucleus at the beginning of S phase. At the end of mitosis, PTOV1 exited
the nucleus. Transient transfection of fluorescence-tagged PTOV1 forced
entry of cells into S phase and increased expression of cyclin D1
(CCND1; 168461).

Santamaria et al. (2005) found that PTOV1 interacted with the lipid raft
protein flotillin-1 (FLOT1; 606998) in detergent-insoluble membrane
fractions. Flotillin-1 colocalized with PTOV1 at the plasma membrane and
in the nucleus, and it entered the nucleus concomitant with PTOV1
shortly before initiation of S phase. Protein levels of PTOV1 and
flotillin-1 oscillated during the cell cycle, with a peak in S phase.
Depletion of PTOV1 significantly inhibited nuclear localization of
flotillin-1, whereas depletion of flotillin-1 did not affect nuclear
localization of PTOV1. Depletion of either protein markedly inhibited
cell proliferation under basal conditions. Overexpression of PTOV1 or
flotillin-1 strongly induced proliferation, which required their
localization to the nucleus and was dependent on the reciprocal protein.
Santamaria et al. (2005) concluded that PTOV1 assists flotillin-1 in its
translocation to the nucleus and that both proteins are required for
cell proliferation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Benedit et al. (2001) determined that the PTOV1 gene contains 12 exons.

MAPPING

By FISH, Benedit et al. (2001) mapped the PTOV1 gene to chromosome
19q13.3-q13.4.

126391	TITLE *126391 LIGASE I, DNA, ATP-DEPENDENT; LIG1
;;DNA LIGASE I
DESCRIPTION The major DNA ligase activity in proliferating mammalian cells is due to
the high molecular weight enzyme designated DNA ligase I. Barnes et al.
(1990) cloned cDNA for human DNA ligase I, both by functional
complementation of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae cdc9 mutation and by
hybridization with oligonucleotide probes corresponding to peptide
sequences of the purified bovine enzyme. Hybridization between the
cloned sequences and mRNA as well as genomic DNA indicated that the
human enzyme is transcribed from a single-copy gene. Barnes et al.
(1990) mapped the DNA ligase I gene to chromosome 19 by hybridization to
DNAs from well-characterized rodent-human somatic cell hybrids retaining
subsets of human chromosomes. By analysis of rodent-human somatic cell
hybrids and by 2-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), Barnes
et al. (1992) assigned the LIG1 gene to 19q13.2-q13.3 and demonstrated
that it is distal to ERCC1 (126380). By FISH, Trask et al. (1993)
assigned the LIG1 gene to 19q13.2-q13.3.

Using a mapping panel from an interspecific cross, Gariboldi et al.
(1995) mapped the Lig1 gene to the centromeric part of mouse chromosome
7, a region homologous to human 19q.

Noguiez et al. (1992) demonstrated that the LIG1 gene has 28 exons
spanning 53 kb of genomic DNA. The first exon is untranslated and uses a
GC dinucleotide instead of the canonical GT splice donor. The 5-prime
flanking region lacks a TATA box and is highly GC-rich, as is
characteristic of 'housekeeping' genes. In common with the promoters of
genes encoding other DNA replication enzymes, such as DNA polymerase
alpha (312040), the 5-prime flanking region of the LIG1 gene contains
recognition elements for several transcription factors that may mediate
increased expression in quiescent cells in response to growth factors.

It has been suggested that a defect in the DNA ligase I gene accounts
for the primary metabolic defect in Bloom syndrome; see 210900. By
screening the coding sequence of the LIG1 gene in 4 cases of Bloom
syndrome, Barnes et al. (1992) found no mutation. However, in a cell
line referred to as 46BR, derived from a patient who displayed
immunodeficiency, stunted growth, and sun sensitivity, they detected 2
missense mutations occurring in different alleles of the LIG1 gene (see
126391.0001). The identification of a definitive and different molecular
defect in Bloom syndrome (210900.0001) excludes further the involvement
of LIG1 in that disorder.

Lindahl and Barnes (1992) gave an extensive review of the mammalian DNA
ligases.

Although it had been reported that DNA ligase I is essential for cell
viability, Bentley et al. (1996) showed that cells lacking DNA ligase I
are, in fact, viable. Using gene targeting in embryonic stem (ES) cells,
they produced DNA ligase I-deficient mice. Embryos developed normally to
midterm, when hematopoiesis usually switches to the fetal liver.
Thereupon, acute anemia developed, despite the presence of
erythroid-committed progenitor cells in the liver. Thus, Bentley et al.
(1996) concluded that DNA ligase I is required for normal development
but is not essential for replication. They proposed that a previously
unsuspected redundancy must exist between mammalian DNA ligases.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure {8:Pascal et al. (2004)} reported the
crystal structure of human DNA ligase I (residues 233-919) in complex
with a nicked, 5-prime adenylated DNA intermediate. The structure shows
that the enzyme redirects the path of the double helix to expose the
nick termini for the strand-joining reaction. It also reveals a unique
feature of mammalian ligases: a DNA-binding domain that allows ligase I
to encircle its DNA substrate, stabilizes the DNA in a distorted
structure, and positions the catalytic core on the nick. Pascal et al.
(2004) suggested that similarities in the toroidal shape and dimensions
of DNA ligase I and the proliferating cell nuclear antigen sliding clamp
are suggestive of an extensive protein-protein interface that may
coordinate the joining of Okazaki fragments.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
DNA LIGASE I DEFICIENCY
LIG1, GLU566LYS

Webster et al. (1982) described a syndrome of immunodeficiency and
increased cellular sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents. The patient had
sun sensitivity and stunted growth and died at the age of 19 years with
lymphoma (Webster et al., 1992). Developmental milestones had been
delayed; she was able to sit at 2 years and did not walk or have normal
sphincter control until 3 years. Recurrent middle ear and chest
infections led to poor hearing and bronchiectasis. Secondary sexual
characteristics did not develop during adolescence. At the age of 17,
patches of venous dilatation appeared on her skin, mainly on the limbs.
There was also some telangiectasia on the bulbar conjunctivae. The
photographs showed the proband to have been less than 130 cm tall at age
14 years (Webster et al., 1992). The cell line derived from the patient,
called 46BR, was shown by Barnes et al. (1992) to contain 2 missense
mutations in different alleles of the DNA ligase I gene, i.e., the
patient was a compound heterozygote. One allele showed a substitution of
lysine for glutamic acid-566 and was presumably derived from the
deceased father because the other allele carried an arg771-to-trp
mutation (126391.0002) which was present also in the mother of the
proband. The cultured fibroblasts exhibited retarded joining of Okazaki
fragments during DNA replication and hypersensitivity to a variety of
DNA-damaging agents.

608537	TITLE *608537 VHL GENE; VHL
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The evolutionarily conserved VHL gene encodes 2 protein products, a
30-kD full-length form (p30) and a 19-kD form (p19). The protein
products of the VHL gene play a role in the oxygen-sensing pathway, in
microtubule stability and orientation, tumor suppression, cilia
formation, regulation of senescence, cytokine signaling, collagen IV
(see 120130) regulation, and assembly of a normal extracellular
fibronectin matrix (summary by Nordstrom-O'Brien et al., 2010).

CLONING

By positional cloning, Latif et al. (1993) identified the VHL tumor
suppressor gene. The gene encodes a 213-amino acid protein with a
predicted acidic repeat domain found in the procyclic surface membrane
glycoprotein of Trypanosoma brucei. The authors identified 2 widely
expressed mRNA transcripts of approximately 6 and 6.5 kb.

Iliopoulos et al. (1995) demonstrated that the product of the VHL gene
is an approximately 30-kD protein.

By screening a rat liver cDNA library, Duan et al. (1995) isolated the
rat VHL gene, which is predicted to encode a 185-amino acid protein. The
rat protein is 88% identical to the aligned 213-amino acid human VHL
gene product. The human and rat proteins had molecular masses of 28 and
21 kD, respectively.

Richards et al. (1996) used in situ hybridization to investigate the
principal sites of VHL expression during embryogenesis. They also
analyzed a variety of fetal tissues for levels of the 2 VHL isoforms,
isoform I, which contains all 3 exons, and isoform II, which contains
only exons 1 and 3. Although VHL expression was found to be ubiquitous,
particularly high levels of expression were detected in the urogenital
system, brain, spinal cord, sensory ganglia, eyes, and bronchial
epithelium. Richards et al. (1996) noted that this expression pattern
correlated to some extent with the pattern of organ involvement in VHL
syndrome but that there were significant differences. Both isoforms of
VHL were detected in all tissues, and the ratio of isoforms was similar
between tissues.

Schoenfeld et al. (1998) identified a second native VHL gene product.
They showed that this 18-kD protein is initiated from the second
translation start site at codon 54, which contains a more conserved
Kozak consensus sequence and thus may serve as a second, internal,
translation initiation site. The significance of a second translation
start site is underscored by the lack of mutations found between the
first and second methionine codons of the VHL gene in both sporadic and
VHL-associated renal carcinomas. This observation suggested that
mutation in this region may not lead to VHL inactivation if translation
could be initiated at the second methionine codon, producing a
functional VHL protein. Furthermore, both the rat and mouse contain only
19 of the 53 amino acids present in this region in the human VHL ORF.
Schoenfeld et al. (1998) concluded that the 18-kD protein contains the
biologic activity of the VHL gene.

Iliopoulos et al. (1998) also demonstrated that in addition to the
213-amino acid VHL protein with an apparent molecular mass of 30 kD
(VHL30), a second VHL protein (VHL19) resulted from internal translation
from the second methionine within the VHL ORF. VHL30 resides primarily
in the cytosol, with lower amounts found in the nucleus or associated
with cell membranes. In contrast, VHL19 is equally distributed between
the nucleus and cytosol and is not found in association with membranes.
VHL19, like VHL30, can bind to elongin B (600787), elongin C (600788),
and Hs-Cul2 in coimmunoprecipitation assays and can inhibit the
production of hypoxia-inducing proteins such as VEGF (192240) and GLUT1
(138140) when reintroduced into renal carcinoma cells that lack a
wildtype VHL allele. Thus, cells contain 2 biologically active VHL gene
products.

GENE STRUCTURE

Latif et al. (1993) determined that the VHL gene contains at least 3
exons.

Zatyka et al. (2002) analyzed the promoter region of the VHL gene and
found 4 regions of conservation between human, primate, and rodent
sequences. In silico analysis identified binding sites for numerous
transcription factors within the conserved regions, and deletion
analysis of the promoter in a reporter assay in 293 and HeLa cells
identified 1 negative and 2 positive regulatory elements. The promoter
contains a functional SP1 (189906) site and overlapping SP1/AP2 (107580)
sites.

GENE FUNCTION

- Role in Tumor Suppression

Maher et al. (1990) compared age incidence curves for sporadic
cerebellar hemangioblastoma and sporadic renal cell carcinoma to those
for familial forms of these tumors that occur as part of von
Hippel-Lindau syndrome (193300). The curves for tumors in VHL syndrome
were compatible with a single mutation model, whereas the age incidence
curves for sporadic tumors suggested a 2-stage mutation process. On the
whole, the findings suggested that the VHL gene functions as a recessive
tumor suppressor gene.

Crossey et al. (1994) presented convincing evidence that the VHL
syndrome gene functions as a recessive tumor suppressor gene and that
inactivation of both alleles of the VHL gene is a critical event in the
pathogenesis of VHL neoplasms. Studies of loss of heterozygosity (LOH)
showed that in 7 tumors from 7 familial cases in which the parental
origin of the 3p26-p25 allele loss could be determined, the allele had
been lost from the chromosome inherited from the unaffected parent. In 4
VHL tumors, LOH on other chromosomes (5q21, 13q, 17q) was found,
indicating that homozygous VHL gene mutations may be required but not
sufficient for tumorigenesis in von Hippel-Lindau syndrome.

When expressed in COS-7 cells, Duan et al. (1995) found that both the
human and the rat VHL proteins showed predominant nuclear, nuclear and
cytosolic, or predominant cytosolic VHL staining by immunofluorescence.
A complicated pattern of cellular proteins was seen that could be
specifically coimmunoprecipitated with the introduced VHL protein. A
complex containing VHL and proteins with apparent molecular masses of 16
and 9 kD was the most consistently observed. Certain naturally occurring
VHL missense mutations demonstrated either complete or partial loss of
the p16-p9 complex. Duan et al. (1995) concluded that the VHL tumor
suppressor gene product is a nuclear protein, perhaps capable of
specifically translocating between the nucleus and the cytosol. They
suggested that VHL may execute its function via formation of specific
multiprotein complexes.

Vogelstein (1995) referred to the VHL gene as a gatekeeper gene for
cancers such as those of the kidney. Rubenstein and Yaari (1994)
suggested that the VHL gene may serve that role in relation to
astrocytoma. They presented the pedigree of a Puerto Rican family in
which at least 9 members had von Hippel-Lindau syndrome and 2 of these
had astrocytoma.

To elucidate the biochemical mechanisms underlying tumor suppression by
the VHL protein, Duan et al. (1995) and Kibel et al. (1995) searched for
cellular proteins that bind to wildtype VHL protein but not to
tumor-derived VHL protein mutants. They found that 2 transcriptional
elongation factors, elongin B (600787) and elongin C (600788), bind in
vitro and in vivo to a short, colinear region of the VHL protein that is
frequently mutated in human tumors. Kibel et al. (1995) showed that a
peptide replica of this region inhibited binding of VHL protein to
elongin B and elongin C, whereas a point-mutant derivative,
corresponding to a naturally occurring VHL missense mutation, had no
effect. Duan et al. (1995) showed that recombinant VHL competes with
elongin A (600786) for elongin B and C binding in vitro. The results
were interpreted as indicating that the normal tumor suppression
function of VHL protein involves the inhibition of transcription
elongation by its binding to elongin B and elongin C.

In a review article, Tyers and Willems (1999) stated that the VHL
protein is part of a complex that includes elongin B, elongin C, and
cullin-2 (CUL2; 603135), proteins that are associated with
transcriptional elongation and ubiquitination. Components of the VCB
(VHL/elongin C/elongin B) complex share sequence similarities with the
E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes SCF (SKP1, (601434); CUL1, (603134); F-box
protein) and APC (anaphase promoting complex; see 603462). Thus, elongin
B is ubiquitin-like, and elongin C and CUL2 are similar to the SKP1 and
CUL1 components of SCF, respectively. Substrate recognition by E3
enzymes such as SCF and APC is crucial because protein degradation must
be highly selective. Both SCF and APC interact with a set of adaptor
proteins that recruit different binding partners through specific
protein-protein interaction domains. SOCS-box-containing proteins (see
603597) may act as adaptors for the VCB complex.

Feldman et al. (1999) demonstrated that the folding and assembly of VHL
into a complex with its partner proteins, elongin B and elongin C, is
directly mediated by the chaperonin TRiC, also called CCT (see 600114).
Association of VHL with TRiC is required for formation of the
VHL-elongin B-elongin C complex. A 55-amino acid domain of VHL (amino
acids 100 to 155) is both necessary and sufficient for binding to TRiC.
Mutation or deletion of this domain is associated with VHL syndrome, and
2 mutations that disrupt the normal interaction with TRiC and impair VHL
folding were identified. These results defined a novel role for TRiC in
mediating oligomerization and suggested that inactivating mutations can
impair polypeptide function by interfering with chaperone-mediated
folding.

Lee et al. (1996) demonstrated that there is a tightly regulated,
cell-density-dependent transport of the VHL protein into and/or out of
the nucleus. In densely grown cells, it is predominantly in the
cytoplasm, whereas in sparse cultures, most of the protein can be
detected in the nucleus. They identified a putative nuclear localization
signal in the first 60 and first 28 amino acids of the human and rat VHL
protein, respectively. Sequences in the C-terminal region of VHL protein
may also be required for localization to the cytosol. The findings
indicated a novel cell-density-dependent pathway responsible for the
regulation of VHL cellular localization.

Iliopoulos et al. (1995) showed that the renal cell carcinoma cell line
786-O, which is known to harbor a VHL mutation, fails to produce a
wildtype VHL protein. Reintroduction of wildtype, but not mutant, VHL
into these cells had no demonstrable effect on their growth in vitro but
inhibited their ability to form tumors in nude mice. Like many cancer
cells, the 786-0 RCC fails to exit the cell cycle upon serum withdrawal.
Pause et al. (1998) showed that reintroduction of the wildtype VHL gene
restores the ability of VHL-negative RCC cells to exit the cell cycle
and enter G0/quiescence in low serum. The cyclin-dependent kinase
inhibitor p27 (CDKN1B; 600778) accumulates upon serum withdrawal, only
in the presence of VHL, as a result of an increase in protein stability.
Pause et al. (1998) proposed that loss of the wildtype VHL gene results
in a specific cellular defect in serum-dependent growth control, which
may initiate tumor formation. Thus, VHL appears to be the first tumor
suppressor involved in the regulation of cell cycle exit, which is
consistent with its gatekeeper function in the kidney.

To discover genes involved in VHL-mediated carcinogenesis, Ivanov et al.
(1998) used renal cell carcinoma cell lines stably transfected with
wildtype VHL-expressing transgenes. Large-scale RNA differential display
technology applied to these cell lines identified several differentially
expressed genes, including an alpha carbonic anhydrase gene, termed CA12
(603263). The deduced protein sequence was classified as a one-pass
transmembrane carbonic anhydrase possessing an apparently intact
catalytic domain in the extracellular CA module. Reintroduced wildtype
VHL strongly inhibited the overexpression of the CA12 gene in the
parental renal cell carcinoma cell lines. Similar results were obtained
with CA9 (603179) which encodes another transmembrane carbonic anhydrase
with an intact catalytic domain. Although both domains of the VHL
protein contributed to regulation of CA12 expression, the elongin
binding domain alone could effectively regulate CA9 expression. By
fluorescence in situ hybridization, Ivanov et al. (1998) mapped CA12 and
CA9 to chromosome bands 15q22 and 17q21.2, respectively, regions prone
to amplification in some human cancers. Ivanov et al. (1998) stated that
additional experiments were necessary to define the role of CA IX and CA
XII enzymes in the regulation of pH in the extracellular
microenvironment and its potential impact on cancer cell growth.

Roe et al. (2006) found that VHL directly associated with and stabilized
p53 (TP53; 191170) by suppressing MDM2 (164785)-mediated ubiquitination
and nuclear export of p53. Moreover, upon genotoxic stress, VHL invoked
an interaction between p53 and p300 (EP300; 602700) and the acetylation
of p53, which led to an increase in p53 transcriptional activity and
cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Roe et al. (2006) concluded that VHL
has a function in upregulating p53.

Yang et al. (2007) noted that VHL-defective renal carcinoma cells
exhibit increased NF-kappa-B (see 164011) activity, which can promote
resistance to chemotherapy or cytokines. They showed that VHL
downregulates NF-kappa-B activity by acting as an adaptor to promote
casein kinase-2 (see 115440)-mediated inhibitory phosphorylation of
CARD9 (607212), an NF-kappa-B agonist.

- Role in Oxygen-Related Gene Expression

The highly vascular tumors associated with von Hippel-Lindau syndrome
overproduce angiogenic peptides such as vascular endothelial growth
factor/vascular permeability factor (VEGF/VPF; 192240). Iliopoulos et
al. (1996) found that renal carcinoma cells lacking wildtype VHL protein
produce mRNAs encoding VEGF/VPF, the glucose transporter GLUT1 (SLC2A1;
138140), and the platelet-derived growth factor B chain (190040) under
both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Reintroduction of wildtype, but
not mutant, VHL protein into these cells specifically inhibited
production of these mRNAs under normoxic conditions, thus restoring
their previously described hypoxia-inducible profile. Iliopoulos et al.
(1996) concluded that the VHL protein appears to play a critical role in
the transduction of signals generated by changes in ambient oxygen
tension.

VEGF mRNA is upregulated in von Hippel-Lindau syndrome-associated
tumors. Mukhopadhyay et al. (1997) assessed the effect of the VHL gene
product on VEGF expression. Using a VEGF promoter-luciferase construct
for cotransfection with a wildtype VHL vector in embryonic kidney and
renal cell carcinoma cell lines, they showed that wildtype VHL protein
inhibited VEGF promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner up to 5- to
10-fold. Deletion analysis defined a 144-bp region of the VEGF promoter
necessary for VHL repression. This VHL-responsive element is GC rich and
specifically bound the transcription factor Sp1 (189906) in crude
nuclear extracts. They further demonstrated that VHL and Sp1 directly
interact with an inhibitory effect on Sp1, suggesting that loss of Sp1
inhibition may be important in the pathogenesis of von Hippel-Lindau
syndrome and renal cell carcinoma.

Maxwell et al. (1999) studied the involvement of VHL in oxygen-regulated
gene expression using ribonuclease protection analysis of 2
VHL-deficient renal carcinoma cell lines, RCC4 and 786-O. Eleven genes
encoding products involved in glucose transport, glycolysis, high energy
phosphate metabolism, and angiogenesis were examined; 9 were induced by
hypoxia in other mammalian cells and 2 were repressed by hypoxia. None
of these responses were seen in the VHL-defective cell lines. Responses
to hypoxia were restored by stable transfection of a wildtype VHL gene,
with effects ranging from a modest action of hypoxia to substantial
regulation. These results indicated that the previously described
upregulation of hypoxia-inducible mRNAs in VHL-defective cells extend to
a broad range of oxygen-regulated genes and involves a constitutive
'hypoxia pattern' for both positively and negatively regulated genes.

Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF1; 603348) has a key role in cellular
response to hypoxia, including the regulation of genes involved in
energy metabolism, angiogenesis, and apoptosis. The alpha subunits of
HIF are rapidly degraded by the proteasome under normal conditions but
are stabilized by hypoxia. Cobaltous ions or iron chelators mimic
hypoxia, indicating that the stimuli may interact through effects on a
ferroprotein oxygen sensor. Maxwell et al. (1999) demonstrated a
critical role for the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene product
VHL in HIF1 regulation. In VHL-defective cells, HIF-alpha subunits were
constitutively stabilized and HIF1 was activated. Reexpression of VHL
restored oxygen-dependent instability. VHL and HIF-alpha subunits
coimmunoprecipitated, and VHL was present in the hypoxic HIF1
DNA-binding complex. In cells exposed to iron chelation or cobaltous
ions, HIF1 is dissociated from VHL. These findings indicated that the
interaction between HIF1 and VHL is iron dependent and that it is
necessary for the oxygen-dependent degradation of HIF-alpha subunits.
Maxwell et al. (1999) suggested that constitutive HIF1 activation may
underlie the angiogenic phenotype of VHL-associated tumors.

In the presence of oxygen, HIF is targeted for destruction by an E3
ubiquitin ligase containing the VHL tumor suppressor protein. Ivan et
al. (2001) found that human VHL protein binds to a short HIF-derived
peptide when a conserved proline residue at the core of this peptide is
hydroxylated. Because proline hydroxylation requires molecular oxygen
and iron, this protein modification may play a key role in mammalian
oxygen sensing. Jaakkola et al. (2001) also demonstrated that the
interaction between VHL protein and a specific domain of the HIF1-alpha
subunit is regulated through hydroxylation of a proline residue
(HIF1-alpha P564) by an enzyme which they termed HIF-alpha
prolyl-hydroxylase (HIF-PH). An absolute requirement for dioxygen as a
cosubstrate and iron as a cofactor suggests that HIF-PH functions
directly as a cellular oxygen sensor.

Mahon et al. (2001) showed that the N-terminal 155 residues of VHL
interact with HIF1AN (606615). They found that VHL functions as a
transcriptional corepressor inhibiting HIF1A transactivation by
recruiting HDAC1 (601241), HDAC2 (605164), and HDAC3 (605166). Epstein
et al. (2001) defined a conserved HIF-VHL-prolyl hydroxylase pathway in
C. elegans and identified Egl9 as a dioxygenase that regulates HIF by
prolyl hydroxylation. In mammalian cells, they showed that the
HIF-prolyl hydroxylases are represented by 3 proteins, PHD1 (606424),
PHD2 (606425), and PHD3 (606426), with a conserved
2-histidine-1-carboxylate iron coordination motif at the catalytic site.
Direct modulation of recombinant enzyme activity by graded hypoxia, iron
chelation, and cobaltous ions mirrored the characteristics of HIF
induction in vivo, fulfilling requirements for these enzymes being
oxygen sensors that regulate HIF.

Hoffman et al. (2001) reported that the products of 4 different type 2C
VHL alleles retain the ability to downregulate HIF but are defective for
promotion of fibronectin (135600) matrix assembly. Furthermore, leu188
to val (L188V; 608537.0014), a well-studied type 2C mutation, retained
the ability to suppress renal carcinoma growth in vivo.

Clifford et al. (2001) investigated in detail the effect of 13 naturally
occurring VHL mutations (11 missense), representing each phenotypic
subclass, on HIF-alpha subunit regulation. Mutations associated with the
PHE-only phenotype (type 2C) promoted HIF-alpha ubiquitylation in vitro
and demonstrated wildtype binding patterns with VHL interacting
proteins, suggesting that loss of other VHL functions are necessary for
PHE susceptibility. Mutations causing HAB susceptibility (types 1, 2A,
and 2B) demonstrated variable effects on HIF-alpha subunit and elongin
binding, but all resulted in defective HIF-alpha regulation and loss of
fibronectin binding. All RCC-associated mutations caused complete
HIF-alpha dysregulation and loss of fibronectin binding. These studies
strengthened the notion that HIF deregulation plays a causal role in
hemangioblastoma and renal carcinoma, and raised the possibility that
abnormal fibronectin matrix assembly contributes to pheochromocytoma
pathogenesis in the setting of VHL syndrome.

Hemangioblastomas of the central nervous system and retina in VHL
patients overexpress vascular endothelial growth factor, which
represents a potential target for anti-angiogenic drugs. In 3 VHL
patients with CNS or retinal hemangioblastomas treated by the anti-VEGF
receptor SU5416, Richard et al. (2002) observed, after 3 to 4 months of
treatment, a secondary paradoxical polycythemia. Hematocrit was normal
before the beginning of the trial, and no progression of
hemangioblastomas was observed. Polycythemia had never been reported in
SU5416 trials for advanced malignancies. In the studies of Richard et
al. (2002), the polycythemia may have represented a specific action on
red blood cell precursors occurring only in the absence of a functional
VHL gene.

Staller et al. (2003) demonstrated that the VHL tumor suppressor protein
negatively regulates CXCR4 (162643) expression owing to its capacity to
target HIF1A (603348) for degradation under normoxic conditions. This
process is suppressed under hypoxic conditions, resulting in
HIF-dependent CXCR4 activation. An analysis of clear cell renal
carcinoma that manifests mutations in the VHL gene in most cases
revealed an association of strong CXCR4 expression with poor
tumor-specific survival. Staller et al. (2003) concluded that their
results suggest a mechanism for CXCR4 activation during tumor cell
evolution and imply that VHL inactivation acquired by incipient tumor
cells early in tumorigenesis confers not only a selective survival
advantage but also the tendency to home to selected organs.

Corn et al. (2003) established that the VHL protein binds to Tat-binding
protein-1 (TBP1; 186852). TBP1 associates with the beta-domain of VHL
and complexes with VHL and HIF1A in vivo. Overexpression of TBP1
promotes degradation of HIF1A in a VHL-dependent manner that requires
the ATPase domain of TBP1. Several distinct mutations in exon 2 of the
VHL gene disrupt binding of VHL to TBP1. A VHL protein mutant containing
an exon 2 missense substitution coimmunoprecipitated with HIF1A, but not
TBP1, and did not promote degradation of HIF1A. Thus, the ability of the
VHL protein to degrade HIF1A depends in part on its interaction with
TBP1 and suggests a new mechanism for HIF1A stabilization in some
VHL-deficient tumors.

To identify novel target genes of the VHL protein, Zatyka et al. (2002)
investigated the effect of wildtype VHL protein on the expression of 588
cancer-related genes in 2 VHL-defective renal cell carcinoma cell lines.
Expression array analysis identified 9 genes that demonstrated a greater
than 2-fold decrease in expression in both RCC cell lines after
restoration of wildtype VHL protein. Three of the 9 genes, VEGF, PAI1
(173360), and LRP1 (107770), had previously been reported as targets of
the VHL protein and are hypoxia-inducible. In addition, 6 novel targets
were detected, including cyclin D1 (CCND1; 168461). No evidence was
found that CCND1 expression was influenced by hypoxia, suggesting that
VHL protein downregulates these targets by an HIF-independent mechanism.

Homozygous disruption of the Vhl gene in mice results in embryonic
lethality from lack of placental vasculogenesis (Gnarra et al., 1997).
To investigate Vhl function in the adult, Haase et al. (2001) generated
a conditional Vhl-null allele (2-lox allele) and a null allele (1-lox
allele) by Cre-mediated recombination in embryonic stem cells. They
showed that mice heterozygous for the 1-lox allele developed cavernous
hemangiomas of the liver, a rare manifestation in the human disease.
Histologically, these tumors were associated with hepatocellular
steatosis and focal proliferations of small vessels. To study the
cellular origin of these lesions, Haase et al. (2001) inactivated VHL
tissue specifically in hepatocytes. Deletion of VHL in the liver
resulted in severe steatosis, many blood-filled vascular cavities, and
foci of increased vascularization within the hepatic parenchyma. These
histopathologic changes were similar to those seen in livers from mice
heterozygous for the 1-lox allele. Hypoxia-inducible mRNAs encoding
vascular endothelial growth factor, glucose transporter-1, and
erythropoietin (EPO; 133170) were upregulated. Thus, targeted
inactivation of mouse Vhl replicated clinical features of the human
disease and underscored the importance of the VHL gene product in the
regulation of hypoxia-responsive genes in vivo.

Wang et al. (2007) showed that mice overexpressing Hif1a in osteoblasts
through selective deletion of Vhl expressed high levels of Vegf (192240)
and developed extremely dense, heavily vascularized long bones. In
contrast, mice lacking Hif1a in osteoblasts had long bones that were
significantly thinner and less vascularized than those of controls. Loss
of Vhl in osteoblasts increased endothelial sprouting from the embryonic
metatarsals in vitro but had little effect on osteoblast function in the
absence of blood vessels. Wang et al. (2007) concluded that activation
of the HIF1A pathway in osteoblasts during bone development couples
angiogenesis to osteogenesis.

Endocytosis plays a major role in the deactivation of receptors
localized to the plasma membrane, and early endocytic events require the
small GTPase RAB5 (179512) and its effector rabaptin-5 (RABEP1; 603616).
Wang et al. (2009) found that hypoxia, via the VHL-HIF2A (603349)
signaling pathway, downregulated rabaptin-5 expression, leading to
decelerated endocytosis and prolonged activation of ligand-bound EGFR
(131550). Primary kidney and breast tumors with strong hypoxic
signatures showed significantly lower expression of rabaptin-5 RNA and
protein. Wang et al. (2009) identified a conserved hypoxia-responsive
element (HRE) in the rabaptin-5 promoter that bound in vitro-translated
HIF1A and HIF2A, leading to displacement of RNA polymerase II and
attenuating rabaptin-5 transcription.

Mehta et al. (2009) reported that in C. elegans the loss of VHL1
significantly increased life span and enhanced resistance to
polyglutamine and beta-amyloid toxicity. Deletion of HIF1 (603348) was
epistatic to VHL1, indicating that HIF1 acts downstream of VHL1 to
modulate aging and proteotoxicity. VHL1 and HIF1 control longevity by a
mechanism distinct from both dietary restriction and insulin-like
signaling. Mehta et al. (2009) concluded that their findings define VHL1
and the hypoxic response as an alternative longevity and protein
homeostasis pathway.

Russell et al. (2011) demonstrated that VHL binds to SOCS1 (603597) and
promotes degradation of phosphorylated JAK2 (147796) via
ubiquitin-mediated destruction.

- Role in Protein Assembly

Ohh et al. (1998) showed that fibronectin coimmunoprecipitated with
normal VHL protein but not tumor-derived VHL mutants. Immunofluorescence
and biochemical fractionation experiments showed that fibronectin
colocalized with a fraction of VHL associated with the endoplasmic
reticulum, and cold competition experiments suggested that complexes
between fibronectin and VHL protein exist in intact cells. Assembly of
an extracellular fibronectin matrix by VHL -/- renal carcinoma cells, as
determined by immunofluorescence and ELISA assays, was grossly defective
compared with VHL +/+ renal carcinoma cells. Reintroduction of wildtype,
but not mutant, VHL protein into VHL -/- renal carcinoma cells partially
corrected this defect. Extracellular fibronectin matrix assembly by VHL
-/- mouse embryos and mouse embryo fibroblasts, unlike their VHL +/+
counterparts, was grossly impaired. Ohh et al. (1998) concluded that VHL
protein is important in fibronectin matrix assembly.

Hergovich et al. (2003) found that VHL is a microtubule-associated
protein that can protect microtubules from depolymerization in several
cell lines. Both the microtubule binding and stabilization functions
depended on amino acids 95-123, a hotspot for mutations in VHL syndrome.
They found that the syndrome-associated mutations Y98H (608537.0009) and
Y112H (608537.0012) disrupted the microtubule-stabilizing function of
the protein.

- Role in Ciliary Maintenance

Using immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy, Lolkema et al. (2008)
showed that Vhl localized to cilia extending from basal bodies stained
with gamma-tubulin (TUBG1; 191135) in primary mouse kidney cells. Cilia
were absent in renal cell carcinoma cells derived from a VHL patient,
but reintroduction of VHL into these cells resulted in rapid cilia
assembly. The cilia function of VHL required residues 1 to 53, which
constitute an acidic domain, and residues 95 to 123, which were
previously implicated in microtubule binding and tumor suppression.

- Role in Central Nervous System Development

Kanno et al. (2000) investigated the role of the VHL gene in CNS
development using rodent CNS progenitor cells. They showed that
expression of the VHL protein is correlated with neuronal
differentiation but not with glial differentiation in CNS progenitor
cells, and also that VHL gene transduction induces neuronal
differentiation. Furthermore, a VHL mRNA antisense oligonucleotide
inhibited differentiation of CNS progenitor cells and upregulated their
cell cycle.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

The ubiquitination of HIF by VHL plays a central role in the cellular
response to changes in oxygen availability. VHL protein binds to HIF
only when a conserved proline in HIF is hydroxylated, a modification
that is oxygen-dependent. Min et al. (2002) determined the 1.85-angstrom
structure of a 20-residue HIF1A-VHL protein-elongin B-elongin C complex
that shows that HIF1A binds to VHL protein in an extended beta
strand-like conformation. The hydroxyproline inserts into a gap in the
VHL hydrophobic core, at a site that is a hotspot for tumorigenic
mutations, with its 4-hydroxyl group recognized by buried serine and
histidine residues. Although the beta sheet-like interactions contribute
to the stability of the complex, the hydroxyproline contacts are central
to the strict specificity characteristic of signaling.

Hon et al. (2002) determined the crystal structure of a hydroxylated
HIF1A peptide bound to the VHL protein, elongin C, and elongin B and
performed solution binding assays, which revealed a single, conserved
hydroxyproline-binding pocket in the VHL protein. They found that
optimized hydrogen bonding to the buried hydroxyprolyl group confers
precise discrimination between hydroxylated and unmodified prolyl
residues. Hon et al. (2002) concluded that this mechanism provides a new
focus for development of therapeutic agents to modulate cellular
responses to hypoxia.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Nordstrom-O'Brien et al. (2010) provided a review of the molecular
genetics of the VHL gene, including the mutational spectrum and
associated phenotypes.

- Von Hippel-Lindau Syndrome

Using restriction fragment analysis, Latif et al. (1993) identified
rearrangements of the VHL gene in 28 of 221 kindreds with von
Hippel-Lindau syndrome (193300). Eighteen of these rearrangements were
due to deletion in the candidate gene. Using pulsed field gel
electrophoresis and cosmid mapping, Latif et al. (1993) established a
physical map of the VHL gene region and identified 3 large
nonoverlapping constitutional deletions in 3 unrelated VHL patients; 1
of these was an in-frame 3-nucleotide deletion at nucleotide 434,
predicted to remove ile146 in the gene product (608537.0001).

Using single-strand conformation polymorphism and heteroduplex analysis
to investigate 94 VHL patients without large deletions, Crossey et al.
(1994) identified 40 different mutations in the VHL gene in 55 unrelated
kindreds: 19 missense mutations, 6 nonsense mutations, 12 frameshift
deletions or insertions, 2 in-frame deletions, and 1 splice donor site
mutation. The 2 most frequent mutations were arg238-to-gln (608537.0005)
and arg238-to-trp (608537.0003), which were detected in 5 and 4
unrelated kindreds, respectively.

Olschwang et al. (1998) screened 92 unrelated patients with VHL syndrome
for point mutations and found 61 DNA variants. In addition, a search for
EcoRI rearrangements revealed germline anomalies in 5 patients. The 61
variants could be subdivided into 20 mutations predicted to alter the
open reading frame and 43 DNA sequence variants that on a priori grounds
were of unknown biologic consequence. The 3-prime end of the coding
sequence of the VHL gene, which encodes the elongin (see 600787)-binding
domain, was the site of 5 of 20 truncating mutations (25%) and 18 of 41
DNA variants (44%) of uncertain functional significance. A similar
screening in 18 patients with sporadic hemangioblastoma revealed 2
missense DNA variants.

Wait et al. (2004) performed genetic analysis of 5 CNS hemangioblastomas
excised from 3 related VHL patients with the same germline VHL gene
deletion. All of the tumors showed distinct 'second-hit' point mutations
on the wildtype allele, even those tumors originating in the same
patient. Moreover, the same types of tumors from the same locations also
showed different point mutations. Wait et al. (2004) concluded that the
somatic mutations were random, and that there is a unique mechanism
underlying tumorigenesis in patients with germline deletion mutations.

Using markers specific for chromosome 3, Glasker et al. (2006) mapped
the deletion size of the 'second-hit' in 16 tumor tissue specimens from
a single patient with VHL syndrome who had a germline heterozygous
partial deletion in the VHL gene. The tumors consisted of 3 central
nervous system hemangioblastomas, 7 renal cell carcinomas, 3 cystic
renal structures, 2 pancreatic tumors, and 1 pancreatic cyst. Deletion
size was highly variable, ranging from short deletions around the VHL
gene to complete deletion of chromosome 3. However, there was no
correlation between deletion size and site of the germline mutation,
affected organ, or type or biological behavior of the tumor. Glasker et
al. (2006) concluded that loss of VHL gene function alone is not
immediately causative for neoplastic growth and suggested that further
molecular events may be required for tumor formation.

- Cancer

The Knudson model predicts that sporadic cancers should be associated
with mutations in the same locus affected in the corresponding
hereditary cancer. Using SSCP and RT-PCR techniques, Latif et al. (1993)
identified aberrant patterns in the VHL gene in 5 renal cell carcinoma
(RCC) lines. In 4 of them, the pattern was due to small, 1- to
10-nucleotide deletions that created frameshift mutations and,
presumably, truncated proteins. In the fifth RCC line, the change was a
nonsense mutation, resulting from a 761C-A transversion.

Eng et al. (1995) identified mutations in the VHL gene in 4 of 48
sporadic pheochromocytomas (171300). Two mutations were somatic and 2
were germline. In a mother and 2 sons with pheochromocytoma, Crossey et
al. (1995) identified a VHL mutation (R238W; 6085327.0003) mutation.
None of them had evidence of VHL syndrome.

In 30 (11%) of 271 unrelated patients with sporadic pheochromocytoma,
Neumann et al. (2002) identified 22 different germline mutations in the
VHL gene (see, e.g., 608537.0014 and 608537.0026).

Zhuang et al. (1996) analyzed VHL gene alterations in sporadic human
colon carcinomas and adenomas using techniques that allowed for
procurement and analysis of selected subpopulations of cells from
paraffin embedded and frozen human tumor specimens. Allelic loss of the
VHL gene was detected in 7 of 11 (64%) of informative patients with
sporadic colon carcinoma. No allelic loss was shown in colon adenomas
from 8 informative patients. The authors suggested that VHL gene loss
may represent a relatively late event in colonic neoplasia progression.

Oberstrass et al. (1996) found abnormalities of the VHL gene in 10 of 20
capillary hemangioblastomas of the CNS. Seven tumors had a frameshift
mutation due either to deletion of 1 or more basepairs (6 cases) or to
insertion of 1 basepair (1 case). The remaining 3 tumors had either
point mutations with intron splice site sequences (2 cases) or a point
mutation resulting in an amino acid substitution (1 case). Evidence for
germline alterations of the VHL gene was found in 2 patients who showed
identical mutations in both tumors and corresponding leukocyte DNA.
Oberstrass et al. (1996) noted that it is significant that one of the 2
tumors with a germline mutation was in an 18-year-old male, and the
other in a 40-year-old female. The non-germline mutations included
tumors from individuals 70, 62, 60, 55, and 52 years old.

Kenck et al. (1996) investigated 91 different parenchymal tumors of the
kidney for mutation in the VHL gene by SSCP and/or heteroduplex
techniques. Evidence of mutation of the VHL gene was associated
exclusively with nonpapillary renal cell carcinoma.

Fearon (1997) reviewed more than 20 different hereditary cancer
syndromes that had been defined and attributed to specific germline
mutations in various inherited cancer genes. In a useful diagram, he
illustrated the roles of allelic variation ('1 gene - different
syndromes') and genetic heterogeneity ('different genes - 1 syndrome')
in inherited cancer syndromes. VHL mutations were used as an example of
the former: inactivating mutations, such as nonsense mutations or
deletions, predisposed to clear-cell renal carcinoma, retinal angioma,
and cerebellar and spinal hemangioblastoma; missense mutations, e.g., in
codon 167, predisposed to these tumors and pheochromocytoma in addition.

Van der Harst et al. (1998) screened the VHL gene for germline mutations
in 68 patients who were operated on for pheochromocytoma. This was
undertaken to follow up on the work of Neumann et al. (1993), who
reported that, according to clinical criteria, approximately 23% of the
apparently sporadic pheochromocytomas may in fact be related to a
familial disorder; these disorders are, in addition to von Hippel-Lindau
syndrome, neurofibromatosis-1 (NF1; 162200) and multiple endocrine
neoplasia types IIA (MEN2A; 171400) and IIB (MEN2B; 162300). They found
mutations in the VHL gene in 8 patients; 2 patients were an uncle and
nephew who had the same missense mutation, R64P (608537.0015). In 4
other patients, missense mutations, P25L, L63P (608537.0016), G144Q, and
I147T, were identified. Three of these mutations (P25L, L63P, and R64P)
were located closer to the N terminus of the VHL protein than any
previously reported VHL mutation. In 2 other cases, the mutations were
located not in the coding region but in the intronic sequence (but not
within splice sites), adjacent to the exon, so that they were probably
not related to the syndrome. The results suggested that 8.8% of patients
(6 of 68) with apparently sporadic pheochromocytomas may carry germline
mutations in the VHL gene. This is a relatively high proportion,
although not as high as the 23% reported earlier.

Gallou et al. (1999) investigated the nature of somatic VHL mutations in
173 primary sporadic human renal cell carcinomas using PCR and SSCP
analysis. They detected an abnormal SSCP pattern in 73 samples. After
sequencing, they identified microdeletions in 58% of cases,
microinsertions in 17%, nonsense mutations in 8%, and missense mutations
in 17%. VHL mutations were found only in the nonpapillary renal cell
carcinoma subtype, as previously reported. To compare somatic and
germline mutations, they used the VHL database, which included 507
mutations. The study of mutational events revealed a significant
difference between somatic and germline mutations. Mutations leading to
truncated proteins were observed in 78% of somatic mutations but in only
37% of germline mutations (P less than 0.001). The authors postulated
that a specific pattern of VHL mutations is associated with sporadic
RCC. This pattern corresponds to mutations leading to truncated
proteins, with few specific missense mutations.

Bender et al. (2000) studied 36 VHL-related pheochromocytomas for
somatic VHL and RET gene alterations and LOH of markers on chromosome
arms 1p, 3p, and 22q. For comparison, they performed the same analyses
in 17 sporadic pheochromocytomas. They found significantly different LOH
frequencies at 3 loci between sporadic and VHL tumors; the more than 91%
LOH of markers on 3p and the relatively low frequencies of LOH at 1p and
22q (15% and 21%, respectively) in VHL pheochromocytomas argue for the
importance of VHL gene dysregulation and dysfunction in the pathogenesis
of almost all VHL pheochromocytomas. In contrast, the relatively low
frequency of 3p LOH (24%) and the lack of intragenic VHL alterations
compared with the high frequency of 1p LOH (71%) and the moderate
frequency of 22q LOH (53%) in sporadic pheochromocytomas argue for genes
other than VHL, especially on 1p, that are significant for sporadic
tumorigenesis and suggest that the genetic pathways involved in sporadic
versus VHL pheochromocytoma genesis are distinct.

Renal cell carcinomas occur frequently in patients treated with
long-term dialysis, especially in cases of end-stage renal disease
(ESRD)/acquired cystic disease of the kidney (ACDK). In patients
receiving dialysis, Yoshida et al. (2002) examined 14 RCCs (7 clear-cell
and 7 papillary carcinomas) for somatic mutations of the VHL gene as
well as of the tyrosine kinase domain of the MET oncogene (164860) to
address the molecular pathogenesis of ESRD/ACDK-associated RCCs. They
found that 3 tumors had VHL frameshifts; 1 showed additional LOH at the
VHL gene locus. All 3 tumors were clear-cell RCCs occurring in ESRD with
55, 106, and 156 months of dialysis, respectively. No mutations were
found in the tyrosine kinase domain of the MET oncogene, where mutations
had previously been found in cases of papillary RCCs.

Maranchie et al. (2004) observed a paradoxically lower prevalence of RCC
in patients with complete germline deletion of VHL. They retrospectively
evaluated 123 patients from 55 families with large germline VHL
deletions, including 42 intragenic partial deletions and 13 complete VHL
deletions. An age-adjusted comparison demonstrated a higher prevalence
of RCC in patients with partial germline VHL deletions relative to
complete deletions (48.9% vs 22.6%, p = 0.007). This striking phenotypic
dichotomy was not seen for cystic renal lesions or for CNS (p = 0.22),
pancreas (p = 0.72), or pheochromocytoma (p = 0.34). Deletion mapping
demonstrated that development of RCC had an even greater correlation
with retention of HSPC300 (C3ORF10; 611183), located within the 30-kb
region of 3p, immediately telomeric to VHL (52.3% vs 18.9%, p less than
0.001), suggesting the presence of a neighboring gene or genes critical
to the development and maintenance of RCC.

Gallou et al. (2004) studied the renal phenotype in 274 individuals from
126 unrelated VHL families in whom 92 different VHL mutations were
identified. The incidence of renal involvement was increased in families
with mutations leading to protein truncation or large rearrangement, as
compared to families with missense mutations (81% vs 63%, respectively;
p = 0.03). In the group with missense mutations, Gallou et al. (2004)
identified 2 mutation cluster regions (MCRs) associated with a high risk
of harboring renal lesions: MCR-1 (codons 74-90) and MCR-2 (codons
130-136). In addition, the incidence of RCCs was higher in families with
mutations leading to protein truncation than in families with missense
mutations (75% vs 57%, respectively; p = 0.04). Furthermore, missense
mutations within MCR-1, but not MCR-2, conferred genetic susceptibility
to RCC.

- Autosomal Recessive Familial Erythrocytosis 2

Inheritance of germline mutations in both VHL alleles was found by Ang
et al. (2002) and by others (Pastore et al., 2003; Percy et al., 2002)
as the cause of autosomal recessive familial erythrocytosis (ECYT2,
263400; see 608537.0019). The VHL protein plays an important role in
hypoxia sensing. It binds to hydroxylated HIF1-alpha and serves as a
recognition component of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. In hypoxia or
secondary to a mutated VHL gene, the nondegraded HIF1-alpha forms a
heterodimer with HIF1-beta and leads to increased transcription of
hypoxia-inducible genes, including EPO. Pastore et al. (2003) reported 7
erythrocytosis patients with VHL mutations in both alleles
(608537.0021-608537.0024). Two Danish sibs and an American boy were
homozygous for the R200W mutation (608537.0019). Three unrelated white
Americans were compound heterozygous for R200W and another VHL mutation:
L188V (608537.0014) in 2 and P192A (608537.0023) in the third.
Additionally, a Croatian boy was homozygous for an H191D mutation
(608537.0024). Pastore et al. (2003) stated that they had not observed
VHL syndrome-associated tumors in subjects with erythrocytosis or their
heterozygous relatives. They found that up to half of the consecutive
patients with apparent congenital erythrocytosis and increased serum EPO
(133170) whom they had examined had mutations of both VHL alleles. They
concluded that VHL mutations are the most frequent cause of recessive
congenital erythrocytosis and define a class of disorders due to
augmented hypoxia sensing.

ANIMAL MODEL

Gemmill et al. (2002) isolated the Drosophila homolog of TRC8 (603046)
and studied its function by genetic manipulations and a yeast 2-hybrid
screen. Human and Drosophila TRC8 proteins localize to the endoplasmic
reticulum. Loss of either Drosophila Trc8 or Vhl resulted in an
identical ventral midline defect. Direct interaction between Trc8 and
Vhl in Drosophila was confirmed by GST-pull-down and
coimmunoprecipitation experiments. Gemmill et al. (2002) found that in
Drosophila, overexpression of Trc8 inhibited growth consistent with its
presumed role as a tumor suppressor gene. Human JAB1 (604850)
localization was dependent on VHL mutant status. Thus, the VHL, TRC8,
and JAB1 proteins appear to be linked both physically and functionally,
and all 3 may participate in the development of kidney cancer.

Ding et al. (2006) used the Cre-loxP system to delete the Vhl gene from
podocytes in the glomerular basement membrane of mice. At about 4 weeks
of age, the mice developed rapidly progressive renal disease with
hematuria, proteinuria, and renal failure with crescentic
glomerulonephritis with prominent segmental fibrin deposition and
fibrinoid necrosis. No immune deposits were present; the phenotype was
similar to human 'pauci-immune' rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis
(RPGN). Gene expression profiling showed increased expression of the HIF
target gene Cxcr4 (162643) in glomeruli from both mice and humans with
RPGN. Treatment of the mice with a Cxcr4 antibody resulted in clinical
improvement, and isolated overexpression of Cxcr4 was sufficient to
cause glomerular disease. Ding et al. (2006) hypothesized that
upregulation of Cxcr4 allowed terminally differentiated podocytes to
reenter the cell cycle, proliferate, and form cellular crescents.

Hickey et al. (2007) found that mice homozygous for the Chuvash
polycythemia-associated VHL mutation (R200W; 608537.0019) developed
polycythemia similar to the human disease. Although bone marrow
cellularity and morphology was similar to controls, spleens from the
mutant mice showed increased numbers of erythroid progenitors and
megakaryocytes, as well as erythroid differentiation of splenic cells in
vitro. Further analysis showed upregulation of HIF2A (603349) and of key
target genes, including EPO, VEGF (192240), GLUT1 (138140), and PAI1
(173360), that contribute to polycythemia.

Using immunofluorescence microscopy, Zehetner et al. (2008) found that
Vhl was expressed in mouse insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells.
Conditional inactivation of Vhl in beta cells promoted a diversion of
glucose away from mitochondria into lactate production, causing cells to
produce high levels of glycolytically derived ATP and to secrete
elevated levels of insulin at low glucose concentrations. Vhl-deficient
mice exhibited diminished glucose-stimulated changes in cytoplasmic
Ca(2+) concentration, electrical activity, and insulin secretion, which
culminated in impaired systemic glucose tolerance. Vhl deletion was
associated with upregulation of Hif1a and the glucose transporter Glut1,
an Hif1a target gene. Combined deletion of Vhl and Hif1a rescued the
defects due to Vhl deletion alone, implying that they resulted from
Hif1a activation.

Lee et al. (2009) generated transgenic mouse embryonic stem cells with
the homozygous VHL type 2B mutation R167Q (608537.0005). Mutant cells
had preserved regulation of both HIF-alpha factors with slightly greater
normotoxic dysregulation of HIF2-alpha. R167Q-derived teratomas had a
growth advantage and showed hemangioma formation. Homozygous mice were
embryonic lethal due to placental failure, and heterozygous mice
developed renal cysts and were predisposed to the carcinogen-promoted
renal carcinoma.

Following the revised codon numbering system of Kuzmin et al. (1995),
the ARG238TRP mutation has been renumbered as ARG167TRP (R167W).

In a study of 94 VHL (193300) patients without large deletions, Crossey
et al. (1994) found that the 2 most frequent mutations were missense
mutations at codon 238: 4 kindreds had a 712C-T transition, resulting in
an arg238-to-trp (R238W) change, and 5 kindreds had a 713G-A transition,
leading to an arg238-to-gln (R238Q; 608537.0005) substitution. Another
mutation 712C-G transversion, resulting in an arg238-to-gly (R238G)
substitution (608537.0004). All 3 mutations at codon 238 occurred at a
CpG dinucleotide. The authors noted that although pheochromocytoma
occurs in only about 7% of patients with VHL, a codon 238 mutation
carried a high risk (62%) of pheochromocytoma.

The R238W mutation was found by Garcia et al. (1997) in a Spanish family
in which VHL was manifested predominantly as familial pheochromocytoma
in 2 generations, consistent with VHL syndrome type 2C.

In a mother and 2 sons with pheochromocytoma (171300), consistent with
VHL syndrome type 2C, Crossey et al. (1995) identified the R238W
mutation.

Zbar et al. (1996) confirmed previous observations that germline codon
167 mutations of the VHL gene (R167W and R167Q; 608537.0005) convey a
high risk for the development of pheochromocytoma and renal cell
carcinoma. In 21 of 33 families with mutations at codon 167,
pheochromocytoma occurred, compared to 15 of 223 families without a
mutation at codon 167. The association between codon 167 mutations and
pheochromocytoma was detected in all nationalities tested. Two of 4
Japanese VHL pheochromocytoma families had mutations at codon 167; and 3
of 10 French VHL pheochromocytoma families had mutations at codon 167.

Neumann et al. (2002) identified the R167Q substitution in the germline
of a patient with sporadic pheochromocytoma (171300).

In the germlines of 6 unrelated patients with sporadic pheochromocytoma
(171300), Neumann et al. (2002) identified the R167W substitution. The
mutation was not identified in 600 control chromosomes.

In a patient with von Hippel-Lindau syndrome (193300), Loeb et al.
(1994) identified a 694C-T transition in exon 3 of the VHL gene,
resulting in an amber stop codon arg232-to-ter (R232X).

Gilcrease et al. (1995) found the identical 694C-T transition as a
somatic mutation in a clear cell papillary cystadenoma of the epididymis
in a patient who showed no evidence of von Hippel-Lindau syndrome and in
whom somatic cells did not contain this mutation.

Following the revised codon numbering system of Kuzmin et al. (1995),
the TRP159SER mutation has been renumbered as TRP88SER (W88S).

In 13 sporadic cases of cerebellar hemangioblastoma, Kanno et al. (1994)
sought somatic mutations in the VHL gene with single-strand conformation
polymorphism analyses of the tumor DNAs. An abnormal SSCP pattern was
detected in 7, and in 3 of these the mutation was successfully
characterized by direct sequencing. The somatic mutations were 2
missense mutations and 1 deletion of a single base. One of the missense
mutations was a 476G-C transversion, resulting in a trp-to-ser change.
The codon number was not noted.

In a Japanese patient with VHL (193300), the Clinical Research Group for
VHL in Japan (1995) identified the 476G-C transversion, which resulted
in a trp159-to-ser (W159S) substitution.

Following the revised codon numbering system of Kuzmin et al. (1995),
the TYR169HIS mutation has been renumbered as TYR98HIS (Y98H), resulting
from a 292T-C transition.

In 14 apparently unrelated von Hippel-Lindau syndrome type 2A (193300)
families from the Black Forest region of Germany, Brauch et al. (1995)
found a 505T-C transition in the VHL gene, resulting in a tyr169-to-his
(Y169H) substitution. Brauch et al. (1995) suggested that more than 75
VHL germline mutations had been identified in VHL patients to that date.
The same mutation, associated with pheochromocytoma, had been identified
by Chen et al. (1995) in 2 VHL 2A families in Pennsylvania. All affected
individuals in the 16 families shared the same VHL haplotype, indicating
a founder effect. In at least one of the Pennsylvania families, the
Y169H mutation probably derived from their Pfalz ancestors, who were
among Germans who migrated to Pennsylvania.

In a patient with the Y169H mutation as the cause of VHL, Schimke et al.
(1998) found a functioning carotid paraganglioma.

Allen et al. (2001) performed a longitudinal clinical study and DNA
analysis of 24 family members, 16 of whom exhibited a 505T-C change in
exon 1 of the VHL gene. Two of the 16 were asymptomatic carriers of the
505T-C mutation. Twelve of 16 (75%) of the gene carriers had 1 or more
ocular angiomas. The mean number of ocular angiomas per gene carrier was
3.3. Six eyes had optic disc angiomas. Five gene carriers (31%) lost
vision because of ocular angiomatosis. Four patients (25%) had
cerebellar hemangioblastomas and 11 patients (69%) had
pheochromocytomas. No patient had renal cell carcinoma, consistent with
the clinical diagnosis of VHL syndrome type 2A. The authors stated that
recognition of the VHL syndrome 2A phenotype suggested the presence of a
specific mutation (505T-C) in the VHL gene. They suggested that
confirmation of this genotype would increase a clinician's ability to
provide favorable prognostic information to affected family members.

Bender et al. (2001) studied 125 individuals in southern Germany
carrying the 505T-C mutation. Forty-seven percent had pheochromocytoma;
36% had retinal angioma; 36%, hemangioblastoma of the spine; and 16% had
hemangioblastoma of the brain. Forty-seven percent of patients were
symptomatic; 30% were asymptomatic despite the presence of at least 1
VHL-related tumor; and 23% of the carriers had no detectable VHL lesion.
Of the 19 patients who died, 10 died of symptomatic VHL lesions. Overall
penetrance by cumulative incidence was estimated at 48% by 35 years and
88% by 70 years. Bender et al. (2001) suggested that the mortality rate
for those carrying this mutation was much lower than in unselected VHL
mutations and was comparable to that of the general population of
Germany.

leu188-to-val (L188V) mutation in the VHL gene. Nine patients had
pheochromocytoma without renal carcinoma (Zbar et al., 1996).

In 6 members of the same German family identified by Neumann et al.
(1995) with von Hippel-Lindau syndrome type 2C, Weirich et al. (2002)
found a P81S mutation in the VHL gene (608537.0020) which cosegregated
with the L188V mutation. Weirich et al. (2002) discussed the possible
impact of these mutations on protein function and phenotype.

In 2 unrelated white American children, a 15-year-old male and a
13-year-old female, who presented at 5 years of age with familial
erythrocytosis (ECYT2; 263400), Pastore et al. (2003) identified a
562C-G transversion in the VHL gene, resulting in the L188V mutation. In
both patients the mutation was in compound heterozygous state with the
common R200W mutation (608537.0019).

Neumann et al. (2002) identified the L188V mutation in the germline of a
patient with sporadic pheochromocytoma (171300). The mutation was not
identified in 600 control chromosomes.

.0015
PHEOCHROMOCYTOMA
VHL, ARG64PRO

In an uncle and his nephew with apparently isolated pheochromocytoma
(171300), van der Harst et al. (1998) found an arg64-to-pro (R64P)
mutation in the VHL gene. This mutation was 1 of 3 missense mutations
identified by van der Harst et al. (1998) that were located closer to
the N terminus of the VHL protein than any previously reported VHL
mutation (see also 608537.0016).

.0016
PHEOCHROMOCYTOMA
VHL, LEU63PRO

In a patient with apparently sporadic pheochromocytoma (171300), van der
Harst et al. (1998) found a leu63-to-pro (L63P) mutation in the VHL
gene. This mutation was 1 of 3 missense mutations identified by van der
Harst et al. (1998) that were located closer to the N terminus of the
VHL protein than any previously reported VHL mutation (see also
608537.0015).

.0017
VON HIPPEL-LINDAU SYNDROME
VHL, TYR112ASN

In a family with VHL (193300), Bradley et al. (1999) identified a 547T-A
transversion in exon 1 of the VHL gene, resulting in a tyr112-to-asn
(Y112N) substitution. Of 13 affected individuals, 7 had renal cell
carcinoma and 1 had pheochromocytoma. The authors contrasted this family
to 2 families reported by Chen et al. (1996) that had a mutation at the
same position but causing a different amino acid change (tyr112 to his;
608537.0012). In these families, 19 of 22 affected individuals had
pheochromocytoma and none had renal cell carcinoma. Bradley et al.
(1999) concluded that different amino acid changes at the same position
can cause very distinct clinical phenotypes.

.0018
RENAL CELL CARCINOMA WITH PARANEOPLASTIC ERYTHROCYTOSIS
VHL, LEU163PRO

Wiesener et al. (2002) described a 50-year-old man, admitted to hospital
for acute myocardial infarction, who was found to have marked
erythrocytosis. Serum erythropoietin (EPO; 133170) was increased, and
ultrasonography demonstrated a mass at the upper pole of the left
kidney. Following nephrectomy, which confirmed the diagnosis of renal
cell carcinoma (144700), EPO serum concentration decreased within 7 days
and hemoglobin levels returned to normal. The patient was well 9 months
later with normal EPO serum concentration. In this patient, Wiesener et
al. (2002) reported that EPO mRNA was not detectable in normal kidney
tissue but markedly upregulated in the tumor. Hypoxia-inducible genes,
including VEGF (192240), GLUT1 (138140), carbonic anhydrase-9 (603179),
lactate dehydrogenase-A (150000), and aldolase A (103850), were also
strongly induced in the tumor. Immunoblots showed significant
overexpression of the HIF1A (603348) and HIF2A (603349) subunits in the
tumor, and immunohistochemistry performed for HIF1A showed nuclear
accumulation of the transcription factor in virtually every tumor cell.
A mutation analysis of the VHL gene in tumor cells revealed a
leu163-to-pro (L163P) missense mutation due to a 701T-C transition in
exon 3. This mutation had previously been identified in another RCC. The
mutation was not present in other tissues of the patient. In this case,
there was a clear indication that the pronounced erythrocytosis was a
precipitating factor in the coronary thrombosis.

.0019
POLYCYTHEMIA, CHUVASH TYPE
VHL, ARG200TRP

Chuvash polycythemia, familial erythrocytosis-2 (263400) caused by this
specific mutation, is an autosomal recessive disorder of erythrocytosis
that is endemic to the mid-Volga River region. Ang et al. (2002) studied
5 multiplex Chuvash families and confirmed that polycythemia was
associated with significant elevations of serum erythropoietin (EPO;
133170) levels and ruled out a location of the gene on chromosome 11 as
had been reported previously by Vasserman et al. (1999). They also ruled
out mutation in the HIF1A gene (603348), which is located in 14q. Using
a genomewide screen, they identified a region on 3p with a lod score
greater than 2 and identified a 598C-T transition in the VHL gene,
resulting in an arg200-to-trp (R200W) mutation in all cases. Ang et al.
(2002) concluded that the R200W substitution impairs the interaction of
VHL with HIF1-alpha, reducing the rate of degradation of HIF1-alpha and
resulting in increased expression of downstream target genes including
EPO, SLC2A1 (138140), transferrin (TF; 190000), transferrin receptor
(TFRC; 190010), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF; 192240).
Mutations in VHL had been associated with pheochromocytoma,
hemangioblastoma, and renal cell carcinoma, none of which were observed
in individuals with Chuvash polycythemia or obligate carriers of the
R200W mutation. Ang et al. (2002) stated that more than 700 mutations
had been reported in VHL (Beroud et al., 1998), but that no individual
had been found to be homozygous or compound heterozygous for germline
mutations.

Pastore et al. (2003) evaluated the role of the VHL gene in 8 children
with a history of polycythemia and an elevated serum EPO level and
identified 3 different germline VHL mutations in 4 of them. One child
was homozygous for the R200W mutation, and another was compound
heterozygous for the R200W mutation and a val130-to-leu mutation (V130L;
608537.0021). Of 2 sibs who were heterozygous for an asp126-to-tyr
mutation (D126Y; 608537.0022), 1 fulfilled some criteria of VHL syndrome
(193300); a pulmonary angioma was discovered at 10 years of age and
treated by coil embolization without effect on the polycythemia, and at
15 years of age nephrectomy was performed for a subcapsular hemangioma.

Percy et al. (2002) observed homozygosity for the R200W mutation in 3
Bangladeshi families with Chuvash-type congenital polycythemia living in
the United Kingdom.

By haplotype analysis of 101 ethnically diverse individuals with the
common R200W mutation, including 72 Chuvash individuals, Liu et al.
(2004) determined that the R200W mutation is due to a founder effect
that originated from 14,000 to 62,000 years ago.

In a matched cohort study, Gordeuk et al. (2004) found that homozygosity
for the 598C-T transition in the VHL gene was associated with vertebral
hemangiomas, varicose veins, lower blood pressures, and elevated serum
VEGF concentrations (p less than 0.0005), as well as premature mortality
related to cerebral vascular events and peripheral thrombosis.
Spinocerebellar hemangioblastomas, renal carcinomas, and
pheochromocytomas typical of classic VHL syndrome were not found,
suggesting that overexpression of HIF1-alpha and VEGF is not sufficient
for tumorigenesis. Although hemoglobin-adjusted serum erythropoietin
concentrations were approximately 10-fold higher in 598C-T homozygotes
than in controls, erythropoietin response to hypoxia was identical.
Gordeuk et al. (2004) concluded that Chuvash polycythemia is a distinct
VHL syndrome manifested by thrombosis, vascular abnormalities, and
intact hypoxic regulation despite increased basal expression of
hypoxia-regulated genes.

Cario et al. (2005) reported a Turkish patient who was homozygous for
the R200W mutation. Haplotype analysis showed a different haplotype than
that associated with the Chuvash population, indicating that the
mutation arose independently and is not geographically restricted.

Perrotta et al. (2006) found that the R200W missense mutation (598C-T)
causing Chuvash polycythemia is more frequent on the island of Ischia in
the Bay of Naples (0.070) than it is in Chuvashia (0.057). The haplotype
of all patients in Ischia matched that identified in the Chuvash
cluster, thus supporting the single founder hypothesis. Perrotta et al.
(2006) also found that unaffected heterozygotes had increased HIF1-alpha
activity, which might confer a biochemical advantage for mutation
maintenance. They suggested that this form of familial polycythemia may
be endemic in other regions of the world, a hypothesis supported by the
reports of Percy et al. (2002, 2003).

Russell et al. (2011) presented evidence suggesting 2 main molecular
mechanisms by which the R200W and H191D (608537.0024) VHL mutations
result in polycythemia. In vitro studies showed that the R200W mutation
attenuated formation of the E3 ubiquitin ligase and attenuated binding
of HIF1 (603348). In patients, this would lead to overproduction of the
HIF-target erythropoietin (EPO; 133170) and thus secondary polycythemia.
In addition, VHL mutations result in conformational changes causing
increased binding to SOCS1 (603597), which inhibits binding and
degradation of phosphorylated JAK2 (147796). The resulting pJAK2
stabilization promotes hyperactivation of the JAK2-STAT5 (601511)
pathway in erythroid progenitors, causing hypersensitivity to
erythropoietin and thereby to primary polycythemia. Treatment of
R200W/R200W transgenic mice with a JAK2 inhibitor resulted in decreased
hematocrit, smaller spleen, and decreased sensitivity to EPO compared to
untreated transgenic mice.

VON HIPPEL-LINDAU SYNDROME
VHL, PRO81SER

In 6 members of a German family in which the L188V mutation in the VHL
gene (608537.0014) had previously been identified in association with
von Hippel-Lindau syndrome type 2C (193300), Weirich et al. (2002)
identified a 454C-T transition in exon 1 of the VHL gene, resulting in a
pro81-to-ser (P81S) mutation. The concurrent P81S mutation was
identified by novel screening approaches, including denaturing
high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) and sequencing. The 2
mutations cosegregated with the syndrome. Weirich et al. (2002)
discussed the possible impact of the mutations on protein function and
phenotype.

VHL, PRO192SER

In a 10-year-old white American boy who presented at age 9 years with
familial erythrocytosis (263400), Pastore et al. (2003) identified
compound heterozygosity for a 574C-T transition in the VHL gene,
resulting in a pro192-to-ser (P192S) change, and the common R200W
mutation (608537.0019).

.0024
ERYTHROCYTOSIS, FAMILIAL, 2
VHL, HIS191ASP

In a 17-year-old Croatian boy who presented at age 1 year with familial
erythrocytosis (263400), Pastore et al. (2003) identified homozygosity
for a 571C-G transversion in the VHL gene, resulting in a his191-to-asp
(H191D) change.

Russell et al. (2011) presented evidence suggesting 2 main molecular
mechanisms by which the H191D and R200W (608537.0019) VHL mutations
result in polycythemia. In vitro studies showed that the H191D mutation
attenuated formation of the E3 ubiquitin ligase and attenuated binding
of HIF1 (603348). In patients, this would lead to overproduction of the
HIF-target erythropoietin (EPO; 133170) and thus secondary polycythemia.
In addition, VHL mutations result in conformational changes causing
increased binding to SOCS1 (603597), which inhibits binding and
degradation of phosphorylated JAK2 (147796). The resulting pJAK2
stabilization promotes hyperactivation of the JAK2-STAT5 (601511)
pathway in erythroid progenitors, causing hypersensitivity to
erythropoietin and thereby to primary polycythemia. Treatment of
R200W/R200W transgenic mice with a JAK2 inhibitor resulted in decreased
hematocrit, smaller spleen, and decreased sensitivity to EPO compared to
untreated transgenic mice.

VON HIPPEL-LINDAU SYNDROME
VHL, VAL84LEU

Following the revised codon numbering system of Kuzmin et al. (1995),
the VAL155LEU (V155L) mutation has been renumbered as V84L.

In 2 sibs from Wales with bilateral pheochromocytoma without other
features of VHL syndrome, consistent with VHL type 2C (193300), Crossey
et al. (1995) identified a heterozygous 463G-T transversion in exon 1 of
the VHL gene, resulting in a val155-to-leu (V155L) substitution.

Abbott et al. (2006) identified the V84L substitution in affected
individuals from 3 unrelated families with early-onset isolated
pheochromocytoma consistent with VHL syndrome type 2C. Although no other
signs of VHL syndrome were present in 7 patients, 1 patient was
suspected to have a spinal hemangioblastoma based on imaging studies.

.0026
PHEOCHROMOCYTOMA
VHL, GLY93SER

In the germlines of 2 unrelated patients with sporadic pheochromocytoma
(171300), Neumann et al. (2002) identified a 490G-A transition in exon 1
of the VHL gene, resulting in a gly93-to-ser (G93S) substitution. The
mutation was not identified in 600 control chromosomes.

.0027
VON HIPPEL-LINDAU SYNDROME
VHL, GLN164ARG

In a 2.5-year-old girl who presented with a pheochromocytoma but no
other manifestations of von Hippel-Lindau syndrome (193300), Sovinz et
al. (2010) identified a heterozygous 491A-G transition in exon 3 of the
VHL gene, resulting in an gln164-to-arg (Q164R) substitution in a
protein surface residue. Genotyping of the family indicated that she
inherited the mutation from her father, in whom it occurred de novo.
Although he was in good health and asymptomatic, detailed physical
examination found a retinal angioma, an adrenal adenoma, and bilateral
pheochromocytoma, consistent with VHL syndrome. Sovinz et al. (2010)
noted that Ong et al. (2007) had identified the Q164R mutation in a
family in which a patient developed pheochromocytoma at age 10 years and
retinal angioma at age 23 years, suggesting that this mutation may be
associated with early onset of symptoms.

601832	TITLE *601832 RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN L29; RPL29
;;HP/HS-INTERACTING PROTEIN; HIP;;
HEPARIN/HEPARAN SULFATE-BINDING PROTEIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Liu et al. (1996) used RT-PCR to identify transcripts encoding cell
surface heparin/heparan sulfate- (HP/HS-) binding peptides. One clone
isolated in this manner had a predicted peptide sequence with features
of an HP/HS-binding motif; the authors termed this transcript HIP, for
'HP/HS interacting protein.' Liu et al. (1996) cloned the corresponding
cDNA from a HeLa cell cDNA library and found that it encodes a 159-amino
acid polypeptide 80% similar to the rodent ribosomal protein L29.
Transfection of HIP cDNA demonstrated cell surface expression, and the
sequence encodes neither a membrane-spanning region nor a glycosylation
site. Northern blot analysis revealed that HIP is expressed as a 1.3-kb
message in a variety of human cell lines and tissues.

Mammalian ribosome proteins are members of multigene families that are
composed predominantly of multiple processed pseudogenes and 1
functional-containing gene, although some, such as human ribosomal
protein L37a, are present as single-copy genes. During a large-scale
partial sequencing of human heart cDNA clones, Law et al. (1996) found a
novel clone that was very similar to the rat ribosomal protein L29 in
both DNA and amino acid sequences. The cDNA encodes a protein that shows
80.4% homology to protein L29 from the large ribosomal subunit of rat.
The putative protein has a large excess of basic residues over acidic
residues, with a unique lysine-rich tandem repeat structure that
suggested a binding function. Liu et al. (1996) showed that RPL29 had
the same nucleotide sequence as does cell surface heparin/heparan
sulfate-binding protein, also designated HB/HS interacting protein.

GENE FUNCTION

Rohde et al. (1996) demonstrated direct binding between heparin and HIP.
They showed that HIP is expressed on the surfaces of intact RL95 uterine
epithelial cells and that RL95 cell suspensions form aggregates when
incubated with antibodies directed against HIP. Using
immunofluorescence, Rohde et al. (1996) demonstrated that HIP is
expressed in both luminal and glandular epithelium of normal human
endometrium.

MAPPING

Garcia-Barcelo et al. (1997) used a PCR-based strategy to distinguish
the functional intron-containing gene RPL29 from multiple pseudogenes.
By somatic cell hybrid analysis, radiation hybrid mapping, and
fluorescence in situ hybridization, they localized RPL29 to the
telomeric region of 3q, where it was the most distal marker identified
to that time. The gene is close to RPL35A (180468), which maps to
3q29-qter.

Kirn-Safran et al. (2000) mapped the single-copy mouse Rpl29 gene to
distal chromosome 9. Promoter analysis indicated the presence of binding
motifs for ubiquitously expressed transcription factors and for nuclear
factor kappa-B (NFKB; see 164011), as well as the lack of a TATA box.

601555	TITLE *601555 RHO FAMILY GTPase 2; RND2
;;RAS HOMOLOG GENE FAMILY, MEMBER N; RHON;;
ARHN;;
GTP-BINDING PROTEIN RHO7; RHO7
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

In the course of a complete genomic sequence analysis of 117 kb from
chromosome 17 containing the BRCA1 gene (113705) located on 17q21, Smith
et al. (1996) identified just centromeric to the BRCA1 gene a novel gene
they designated RHO7. RHO7 was identified initially as a homolog to the
RHO family (see 165370) of GTP-binding proteins (Chardin, 1991) by a
database search using deduced amino acid sequences from predicted exons.
The gene was found to be highly similar to the mouse EST homolog, with
more than 90% identity between the 2 nucleotide sequences.

By screening a human fetal brain cDNA library using bovine Rnd1 (609038)
as probe, Nobes et al. (1998) cloned RND2. The deduced protein contains
227 amino acids and has a calculated molecular mass of 25.3 kD. It has 3
guanine-binding motifs, 2 loops and a threonine involved in phosphate
binding, and 3 major residues that coordinate magnesium in the GTP-bound
state. However, RND2 lacks the residues important for the intrinsic
GTPase activity of RAS (see 190020). RND2 ends with a CAAX box motif and
a terminal methionine residue, suggesting that RND2 is farnesylated.
Northern blot analysis detected high expression of a 1.5-kb RND2
transcript only in testis, with little to no expression in all other
adult and fetal tissues examined.

GENE FUNCTION

Heng et al. (2008) demonstrated that the proneural protein neurogenin-2
(Neurog2; 606624), which controls neurogenesis in the embryonic cortex,
directly induces the expression of the small GTP-binding protein Rnd2 in
newly generated mouse cortical neurons before they initiate migration.
Rnd2 silencing leads to a defect in radial migration of cortical neurons
similar to that observed when the Neurog2 gene is deleted. Remarkably,
restoring Rnd2 expression in Neurog2-mutant neurons is sufficient to
rescue their ability to migrate. Heng et al. (2008) concluded that their
results identified Rnd2 as a novel essential regulator of neuronal
migration in the cerebral cortex and demonstrated that Rnd2 is a major
effector of Neurog2 function in the promotion of migration. Thus, a
proneural protein controls the complex cellular behavior of cell
migration through a remarkably direct pathway involving the
transcriptional activation of a small GTP-binding protein.

MAPPING

By FISH, Nobes et al. (1998) mapped the RND2 gene to chromosome 17q21.

;;KALLIKREIN 4;;
PROTEASE, SERINE, 17; PRSS17;;
PROSTASE; PSTS;;
ENAMEL MATRIX SERINE PROTEINASE 1; EMSP1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Identification of genes with selective expression in specific organs or
cell types provides an entry point for understanding biologic processes
that occur uniquely within a particular tissue. Using a subtraction
approach designed to identify genes preferentially expressed in specific
tissues, Nelson et al. (1999) identified PRSS17, which they referred to
as prostase, a human serine protease with prostate-restricted
expression. The prostase cDNA encodes a putative 254-amino acid
polypeptide with a conserved serine protease catalytic triad and an
amino-terminal pre-propeptide sequence, indicating a potential secretory
function. Prostase shares 35% amino acid identity with prostate-specific
antigen (PSA; 176820) and 78% identity with the porcine enamel matrix
serine proteinase-1, an enzyme involved in enamel matrix degradation and
with a putative role in the disruption of intercellular junctions.
Northern blot analysis revealed that the prostase gene was expressed as
a 1.3-kb transcript in hormonally responsive normal and neoplastic
prostate epithelial tissues, but not in prostate stromal constituents.
The sequence homology between prostase and other well-characterized
serine proteases suggests several potential functional roles for the
prostase protein, including the degradation of extracellular matrix and
the activation of PSA and other proteases.

By RT-PCR of 35 adult and fetal tissues, Gan et al. (2000) detected
highest KLK4 expression in prostate, with weaker expression in several
other tissues.

Using heterozygous Klk4-Xgal reporter mice, Simmer et al. (2009) showed
that Klk4 expression began in ameloblasts of the developing mouse tooth
starting at postnatal day 8, concurrent with the transition stage, and
continued thereafter. Klk4 was not expressed in secretory stage
ameloblasts or in odontoblasts.

GENE FUNCTION

By immunohistochemical analysis of a prostate tissue microarray, Klokk
et al. (2007) found overexpression of KLK4 in malignant prostate
compared with normal prostate. KLK4 was predominantly expressed in
nuclei of basal cells in the prostate epithelium, in keeping with its
distribution in prostate cancer cells in vitro. Adenovirus-mediated KLK4
expression dramatically induced proliferation of prostate cancer cells,
at least in part, through significant alterations in cell cycle
regulatory gene expression. Consistent with these data, small
interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of endogenous KLK4 in LNCaP prostate
cancer cells inhibited cell growth. Klokk et al. (2007) concluded that
KLK4 is a proliferative factor with effects on gene expression and
suggested that it may have a role in prostate cancer development and
progression.

GENE STRUCTURE

Nelson et al. (1999) determined that the PRSS17 (KLK4) genomic sequence
contains multiple copies of a chromosome 19q-specific minisatellite
repeat.

Hu et al. (2000) determined that the human KLK4 gene contains 6 exons, 5
of which are coding.

MAPPING

By PCR analysis of a radiation hybrid panel, Nelson et al. (1999) mapped
the PRSS17 gene to chromosome 19q13, a region containing several other
serine proteases, including prostate-specific kallikrein-2 (KLK2;
147960). By fluorescence in situ hybridization, DuPont et al. (1999)
assigned the PRSS17 gene to 19q13.3-q13.4.

By sequencing the kallikrein gene cluster on chromosome 19q13, Gan et
al. (2000) identified 13 kallikrein-related genes, including KLK4, and 5
pseudogenes.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 2 affected sibs of a family with autosomal recessive hypomaturation
amelogenesis imperfecta (204700), Hart et al. (2004) identified a
nonsense mutation in the KLK4 gene (603767.0001).

ANIMAL MODEL

Simmer et al. (2009) found that Klk4-null mice developed normally but
often died prior to maturity due to difficulty eating. When weaned late
and placed on a soft diet, young Klk4-null mice eventually achieved
normal adult body size and near normal fertility. Scanning electron
microscopy revealed that the enamel on all biting surfaces of Klk4-null
teeth was abraded following weaning. Individual enamel crystallites of
erupted teeth failed to grow together, interlock, and function as a
unit. Instead, individual crystallites appeared to spill out of the
enamel when fractured. Simmer et al. (2009) concluded that KLK4 is
essential for removal of enamel proteins and proper maturation of enamel
crystals.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
AMELOGENESIS IMPERFECTA, PIGMENTED HYPOMATURATION TYPE
KLK4, TRP153TER

In 2 sibs with autosomal recessive pigmented hypomaturation amelogenesis
imperfecta (204700), Hart et al. (2004) found the substitution of a stop
codon for a tryptophan residue at codon 153 of kallikrein-4 (W153X).
Tryptophan-153 is completely conserved across KLK4 proteins in mouse and
pig, and across all human kallikrein proteins. The resultant truncated
protein would lack the final 101 amino acids, including the serine-107
of the catalytic triad.

SPLICEOSOME-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN, 130-KD; SAP130
DESCRIPTION For background information on the SF3B proteins, see SF3B1 (605590).

CLONING

By SDS-PAGE fractionation of spliceosomal complex A, micropeptide
sequence analysis, database searching, and cDNA library screening, Das
et al. (1999) isolated a cDNA encoding SF3B3, which they called SAP130.
SF3B3 encodes a predicted 1,217-amino acid protein identical to that
encoded by the KIAA0017 cDNA identified by Nomura et al. (1994) .
Western blot analysis detected a 130-kD protein in nuclear extracts, in
vitro translated cDNA, and spliceosomal complexes. Coimmunoprecipitation
and Western blot analysis determined that SF3B3 and other SF3B proteins
are components of U2 snRNP, and that SF3B1, SF3B2 (605591), and SF3B3
exist in a specific protein complex independent of SF3A and U2 snRNA.
Das et al. (1999) observed that the interaction between SF3B3 and SF3B1
is tighter than the interaction between SF3B3 and SF3B2.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the SF3B3
gene to chromosome 16 (TMAP WI-15368).

610316	TITLE *610316 POLYRIBONUCLEOTIDE NUCLEOTIDYLTRANSFERASE 1; PNPT1
;;OLD35;;
PNPase
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

PNPT1 is a subunit of the exosome complex, which is involved in
3-prime-to-5-prime exoribonuclease activity for RNA processing and
degradation (Raijmakers et al., 2002). The enzyme is predominantly
located in the mitochondrial intermembrane space and is involved in
import of RNA to mitochondria (Vedrenne et al., 2012).

CLONING

By screening for genes expressed in both terminally differentiated and
senescent cells, followed by 3-prime and 5-prime RACE of a human
metastatic melanoma cell line cDNA library, Leszczyniecka et al. (2002)
cloned 2 variants of PNPT1, which they called OLD35. The variants differ
only in the length of their 3-prime UTRs, and both encode a deduced
783-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 86 kD. PNPT1
contains 2 RNase PH domains, a KH domain, and a C-terminal S1 domain.
Northern blot analysis detected 4.0- and 2.6-kb transcripts in
terminally differentiated human melanoma cells.

Raijmakers et al. (2002) identified a putative mitochondrial targeting
sequence in the N terminus of PNPT1. By immunohistochemical analysis,
Piwowarski et al. (2003) demonstrated colocalization of endogenous PNPT1
with a mitochondrial marker protein in HeLa cells. Mutation analysis
confirmed that N-terminal sequences of PNPT1 target it to mitochondria.

Leszczyniecka et al. (2003) cloned mouse Pnpt1, which encodes a
782-amino acid protein that shares about 90% amino acid identity with
human PNPT1.

Von Ameln et al. (2012) demonstrated expression of the Pnpt1 gene in the
murine cochlea, including the inner and outer sensory hair cells and the
auditory ganglion neurons. The protein showed predominantly
mitochondrial localization. The zebrafish ortholog was broadly expressed
during early development, and later showed more restricted expression in
the tectum, the gill arches, and the developing ear. The findings were
compatible with a role for the protein auditory function.

GENE FUNCTION

By in vitro analysis of the recombinant protein, Leszczyniecka et al.
(2002) found that PNPT1 was a phosphate-dependent 3-prime-to-5-prime RNA
exonuclease that produced nucleotide diphosphates, but not nucleotide
monophosphates, during degradation of an RNA substrate. Expression of
PNPT1 was induced by interferon-beta (see IFNB1; 147640) in a human
metastatic melanoma cell line, and expression of PNPT1 suppressed
melanoma cell colony formation.

By mutation analysis of the PNPT1 promoter, Leszczyniecka et al. (2003)
found that a region containing an interferon-stimulated regulatory
element (ISRE) and an SP1 (189906) element was required for
IFNB-stimulated PNPT1 expression in a human melanoma cell line, but a
GAS element and an IFN regulatory factor-1 (IRF1; 147575)-binding site
were not required. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated
that the ISGF3 complex (see ISGF3G; 147574) bound the ISRE, and IFNB
stimulation increased ISGF3 binding. PNPT1 mRNA levels and promoter
activity were stimulated about 3.5-fold by IFNB in a human fibrosarcoma
cell line, but not in lines defective in JAK (see JAK1; 147795)-STAT
(see STAT1; 600555) signaling. IFNB did not affect PNPT1 mRNA stability,
and PNPT1 upregulation did not require protein synthesis, indicating
that PNPT1 is an early IFN response gene.

GENE STRUCTURE

Leszczyniecka et al. (2003) determined that the PNPT1 gene contains 28
exons and spans about 54 kb. The promoter region has no TATA or CAAT
elements, but has an ISRE, a GAS element, and IRF1-binding sites. The
3-prime UTR of PNPT1 is AU rich and contains 4 AUUUA motifs.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid and genomic sequence analyses, Leszczyniecka et al.
(2003) mapped the PNPT1 gene to chromosome 2p16.1-p15. They identified
PNPT1 pseudogenes on chromosomes 3p26.1 and 7q31.31.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Combined Oxidative Phosphorylation Deficiency 13

In 2 Moroccan sibs, born of consanguineous parents, with combined
oxidative phosphorylation deficiency-13 (COXPD13; 614932), Vedrenne et
al. (2012) identified a homozygous mutation in the PNPT1 gene (Q387R;
610316.0001). The patients had a severe encephalomyopathy with onset of
severe hypotonia and movement abnormalities in late infancy. Biochemical
studies showed that the mutation impaired normal import of several RNA
species into mitochondria and caused a defect in mitochondrial
translation, resulting in mitochondrial respiratory chain deficiency.

- Autosomal Recessive Deafness 70

By homozygosity mapping followed by candidate gene analysis of a
Moroccan family with autosomal recessive deafness-70 (DFNB70; 614934),
von Ameln et al. (2012) identified a homozygous mutation in the PNPT1
gene (E475G; 610316.0002). The mutant protein was expressed, stable, and
showed normal mitochondrial localization in HEK293T cells, but in vitro
studies in bacteria, yeast, and mammalian cells showed that the mutation
results in a hypofunctional protein leading to disturbed PNPase
trimerization and impaired mitochondrial RNA import. The findings
indicated that PNPT1 plays a role in auditory function.

PNPT1, GLN387ARG

In 2 Moroccan sibs, born of consanguineous parents, with early-onset
encephalomyopathy due to combined oxidative phosphorylation
deficiency-13 (COXPD13; 614932), Vedrenne et al. (2012) identified a
homozygous 1160A-G transition in exon 13 of the PNPT1 gene, resulting in
a gln387-to-arg (Q387R) substitution at a highly conserved residue. The
mutation was found by exome sequencing and confirmed by Sanger
sequencing. Patient fibroblasts showed about 50 to 60% of normal PNPase
levels, suggesting that the mutation destabilizes the mutant protein.
Immunoblot analysis of patient cells showed absence of PNPase trimers,
suggesting that the mutation alters multimerization of the protein.
Patient cells also showed a significant decrease in 5S rRNA (180420) and
RNase mitochondrial RNA processing (MRP)-related RNA import into
mitochondria compared to control; similar findings were observed in
control cells with siRNA knockdown of PNPT1. Patient cells also showed a
decrease in mitochondrial translation. Overexpression of wildtype PNPT1
in patient cells rescued these defects.

In 3 Moroccan sibs, born of consanguineous parents, with autosomal

(2012) identified a homozygous 1424A-G transition resulting in
substitution of gly at glu475 (E475G), a highly conserved residue in the
second RNase-PH domain. The mutation segregated with deafness in the
family and was not found in multiple control databases. The mutant
protein was expressed, stable, and showed normal mitochondrial
localization in HEK293T cells, but in vitro studies in bacteria, yeast,
and mammalian cells showed that the mutation results in a hypofunctional
protein leading to disturbed PNPase trimerization and impaired
mitochondrial RNA import.

614027	TITLE *614027 INSULINOMA-ASSOCIATED 2; INSM2
;;INSULINOMA-ASSOCIATED GENE 6; IA6
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

INSM2 belongs to the SNAI1 (604238)/GFI1 (600871)/INSM1 (600010) family
of transcriptional repressors (Cai et al., 2011).

CLONING

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to INSM1, followed by
PCR of a human brain cDNA library, Cai et al. (2011) cloned INSM2. The
deduced 566-amino acid protein contains an SNAI1/GFI1 motif followed by
2 proline-rich sequences in its N-terminal half and 5 C2H2-type zinc
fingers in its C-terminal half. INSM2 shares 51% amino acid identity
with INSM1. Northern blot analysis detected a 4.8-kb INSM2 transcript
that was highly expressed in heart and pancreas, with lower expression
in liver, skeletal muscle, and kidney, and little to no expression in
brain, placenta, and lung. Northern blot analysis of mouse tissues
showed a similar expression profile. Insm2 was detected at all embryonic
mouse stages examined, with highest expression between days 11.5 and
13.5 of whole embryos. In developing mouse brain, expression peaked 2
weeks postnatally and gradually decreased to adult levels. Western blot
analysis detected Insm2 at an apparent molecular mass of 60 kD in mouse
pancreas and brain, mouse MIN6 islet and N2a neuroblastoma cells, and
rat PC12 adrenal pheochromocytoma cells. Immunofluorescence analysis
detected INSM2 in mouse and human pancreatic islet alpha and beta cells,
but not in acinar cells. It was also detected in fetal duodenum and in
deeper layers of mouse adrenal glands, neuronal cells of the cerebral
cortex, Purkinje cells of cerebellum, and CA1 and CA3 regions of the
hippocampus. INSM2 colocalized with NGN3 (NEUROG3; 604882) and NEUROD1
(601724) in human and mouse fetal pancreas.

GENE FUNCTION

Cai et al. (2011) identified 10 putative E boxes (CANNTG) in the 5-prime
region of mouse and human INSM2. They found that the 2 most proximal E
boxes of the mouse Insm2 gene were bound by the basic helix-loop-helix
transcription factors Ngn3 and NeuroD1. Ngn3 and NeuroD1 upregulated
expression of a reporter gene containing these Insm2 E boxes. Activation
of the Insm2 promoter by Ngn3 and NeuroD1 was enhanced by the cofactor
E47 (TCF3; 147141).

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Cai et al. (2011) mapped the INSM2 gene to
chromosome 14q13.2.

NOMENCLATURE

Although PTPRN (601773) has been referred to as insulinoma-associated
protein-2, or IA2, in the literature, it is distinct from INSM2.

300278	TITLE *300278 NYCTALOPIN; NYX
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By positional cloning and the candidate gene approach, directed at the
elucidation of the defect in complete congenital stationary night
blindness (CSNB1; 310500), Bech-Hansen et al. (2000) identified a novel
gene, NYX, that encodes a protein (nyctalopin) of 481 amino acids.
Nyctalopin shows sequence similarity with members of the superfamily of
proteins containing tandem arrays of the leucine-rich repeat (LRR)
motif, as well as other features qualifying the protein as a member of
the subfamily of small leucine-rich proteoglycans (SLRPs). By PCR
amplification of tissue-specific cDNA, Bech-Hansen et al. (2000)
detected expression of NYX in retina and kidney only. In the retina it
appeared to be expressed in photoreceptors, bipolar and amacrine
interneurons, and ganglion cells.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Bech-Hansen et al. (2000) studied 22 families with X-linked complete
CSNB and found 14 different mutations, including 1 founder mutation in 7
families from the United States, in the NYX gene.

Pusch et al. (2000) likewise detected 14 different mutations. In 3
families the gene was partially deleted. They found expression of the
gene at low levels in retina, brain, testis, and muscle.

ANIMAL MODEL

Gregg et al. (2003) studied the naturally occurring mouse mutant nob (no
b-wave) to determine whether it provided an animal model for the
complete form of human X-linked congenital stationary night blindness.
They found that the nob phenotype was caused by an 85-bp deletion in the
mouse Nyx gene. Behavioral testing showed that the nob mice had a
significant decrease in visual sensitivity. Thus, they concluded, the
nob mouse was a model for human CSNB1.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
NIGHT BLINDNESS, CONGENITAL STATIONARY, TYPE 1A
NYX, 24-BP DEL

In 7 families from the United States, Bech-Hansen et al. (2000) found
that the same in-phase 24-bp deletion was associated with X-linked
complete congenital stationary night blindness (310500). The deletion
was predicted to result in the loss of the 8 amino acids RACPAACA from
the N-terminal cysteine cluster of nyctalopin. A genotype analysis of
the X chromosomes with this deletion suggested that these families share
a common founder mutation.

.0002
NIGHT BLINDNESS, CONGENITAL STATIONARY, TYPE 1A
NYX, TRP350TER

In 2 large pedigrees of Hispanic origin (from Costa Rica), Bech-Hansen
et al. (2000) found that X-linked complete congenital stationary night
blindness (310500) was associated with a trp350-to-ter (W350X) mutation
in the NYX gene. This was predicted to eliminate the portion of
nyctalopin required for establishing the GPI anchor, and potentially
resulted in the protein being soluble rather than membrane-tethered.

.0003
NIGHT BLINDNESS, CONGENITAL STATIONARY, TYPE 1A
NYX, CYS35TER

In 4 families, Pusch et al. (2000) found that complete congenital
stationary night blindness (310500) was associated with a cys35-to-ter
(C35X) mutation in the NYX gene, resulting from a C-to-A transversion at
nucleotide 105, changing TGC to TGA. No evidence for a founder allele
was found for these families.

.0004

NYX, ALA187LYS

Pusch et al. (2000) found an ala187-to-lys (A187K) mutation in the NYX
gene in affected members of 3 families from Sweden with congenital
stationary night blindness (310500). They were found to share a common
haplotype.

.0005
NIGHT BLINDNESS, CONGENITAL STATIONARY, TYPE 1A
NYX, ARG94PRO

In affected members of a large Chinese family with congenital stationary
night blindness (310500), Xiao et al. (2006) identified a 281G-C
transversion in the NYX gene, resulting in an arg94-to-pro (R94P)
substitution in the second leucine-rich repeat of the protein. The
mutation was not identified in 96 control individuals.

.0006
NIGHT BLINDNESS, CONGENITAL STATIONARY, TYPE 1A
NYX, ILE101THR

In a Chinese boy with congenital stationary night blindness (310500),
Xiao et al. (2006) identified a 302T-C transition in the NYX gene,
resulting in an ile101-to-thr (I101T) substitution in the third
leucine-rich repeat of the protein. Two additional male family members
were affected, although molecular analysis was not performed. The
mutation was not identified in 96 control individuals.

107265	TITLE *107265 CD19 ANTIGEN; CD19
;;B-LYMPHOCYTE ANTIGEN CD19
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CD19 is a cell surface molecule expressed only by B lymphocytes and
follicular dendritic cells of the hematopoietic system. It is the
earliest of the B-lineage-restricted antigens to be expressed and is
present on most pre-B cells and most non-T-cell acute lymphocytic
leukemia cells and B-cell type chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells
(Tedder and Isaacs, 1989).

CLONING

Tedder and Isaacs (1989) isolated cDNA clones that encode CD19 from a
human tonsil cDNA library and determined the amino acid sequence. The
amino acid sequence showed no significant homology with other known
proteins, but the putative extracellular region contained 2 Ig-like
domains, indicating that CD19 is a new member of the Ig superfamily. The
CD19 molecule has a molecular mass of about 95,000 Da.

GENE FUNCTION

Carter and Fearon (1992) described the role of CD19 in helping the B
cell resolve its dilemma, the conflict between broad specificity and
sensitivity. The former is met by low-affinity antigen receptors, which
precludes achieving the latter with high-affinity receptors. Coligation
of CD19 with the antigen receptor of B lymphocytes decreases the
threshold for antigen receptor-dependent stimulation by 2 orders of
magnitude. Thus, B lymphocytes proliferate when approximately 100
antigen receptors per cell, 0.03% of the total, are ligated with CD19.

Fujimoto et al. (2000) noted that CD19, which contains a 240-amino acid
cytoplasmic tail with 9 conserved tyr (Y) residues, intersects with
multiple intracellular signaling pathways. LYN (165120), the predominant
Src kinase in B cells, is critical in B-cell antigen receptor (BCR,
e.g., IgM; 147020) signaling and regulation. Using cells from transgenic
mice, the authors demonstrated that following BCR and/or CD19 ligation,
LYN phosphorylates CD19 at Y513, then binds to CD19 via its SH2 domain
and phosphorylates Y482 through what Fujimoto et al. (2000) called
'processive phosphorylation.' Phosphorylated CD19-Y482 then recruits
another LYN molecule, leading to LYN phosphorylation and/or
autophosphorylation. CD19 phosphorylation induces conformational changes
that permit phosphorylation of CD19-Y391. This molecule then recruits
VAV (164875), which is in turn phosphorylated by LYN. In vivo, CD19
deficiency impaired, and CD19 overexpression enhanced, LYN kinase
activity. CD19 thus functions as a specialized adaptor protein for the
amplification of Src family kinases that is crucial for intrinsic and
antigen receptor-induced signal transduction.

Sato et al. (2000) subtly increased CD19 cell surface expression in mice
using transgenic techniques and found that these changes induced
autoantibody production. They found a similar increase in CD19
expression on B cells in patients with systemic sclerosis (see 181750),
whereas CD20 (MS4A1; 112210), CD22 (107266), and CD40 (109535)
expression was unchanged. Sato et al. (2000) proposed that modest
changes in expression of regulatory molecules, such as CD19, may shift
the balance between tolerance and immunity to autoimmunity.

MAPPING

Ord et al. (1994) assigned the CD19 gene to 16p11.2 by in situ
hybridization and by PCR analysis of a panel of human/hamster somatic
cell hybrid DNAs. The mouse gene was mapped to bands F3-F4 of chromosome
7 by in situ hybridization. Segregation analysis in interspecific
backcross progeny showed linkage to loci previously mapped to the same
region of mouse chromosome 7 in a region of conserved synteny with human
chromosome 16.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Van Zelm et al. (2006) evaluated 4 patients from 2 unrelated families
who had increased susceptibility to infection, hypogammaglobulinemia,
and normal numbers of mature B cells in blood, consistent with common
variable immunodeficiency (CVID3; 613493). They found that all 4
patients had homozygous mutations in the CD19 gene. Levels of CD19 were
undetectable in 1 patient and substantially reduced in the other 3.
Levels of CD21 (120650) were decreased, whereas levels of CD81 (186845)
and CD225 (IFITM1; 604456) were normal, in all 4 patients. The
composition of the precursor B-cell compartment in bone marrow and the
total numbers of B cells in blood were normal. However, the number of
CD27-positive (186711) memory B cells and CD5-positive (153340) B cells
were decreased. Secondary follicles in lymphoid tissues were small to
normal in size and had a normal cellular composition. The few B cells
that showed molecular signs of switching from one immunoglobulin class
to another contained V(H)-C(alpha) and V(H)-C(gamma) transcripts with
somatic mutations. The response of the patients' B cells to in vitro
stimulation through the B-cell receptor was impaired, and in all 4
patients, the antibody response to rabies vaccination was poor. Van Zelm
et al. (2006) concluded that mutation of the CD19 gene causes a type of
hypogammaglobulinemia in which the response of mature B cells to
antigenic stimulation is defective. On the basis of the crucial role of
CD19 in signaling by the B-cell receptor on antigen recognition, van
Zelm et al. (2006) thought it likely that defects in other members of
the CD19 complex (CD21, CD81, and CD225) also lead to antibody
deficiency in humans.

ANIMAL MODEL

Hasegawa et al. (2001) generated mice deficient in both Cd19 and Lyn.
Cd19 deficiency suppressed the hyperresponsive phenotype of Lyn -/- B
cells and autoimmunity characterized by serum autoantibodies and immune
complex-mediated glomerulonephritis in Lyn -/- mice. Cd19/Lyn -/- mice
had additional reduction of primitive, predominantly IgM-secreting B1
lymphocytes. Cd19 deficiency inhibited activation of Src family protein
tyrosine kinase-dependent signaling pathways and delayed enhanced
intracellular calcium responses following B-cell antigen receptor
ligation in Lyn -/- B cells. Hasegawa et al. (2001) concluded that Cd19
expression is required for the development of autoimmunity in Lyn -/-
mice.

By selective inactivation of Pten (601728) in mouse B lymphocytes and
immunohistochemical analysis, Anzelon et al. (2003) detected a selective
expansion of marginal zone (MZ) B and B1 cells. Pten-deficient B cells
were hyperproliferative in response to mitogenic stimuli and had a lower
threshold for activation through the B lymphocyte antigen receptor.
Inactivation of Pten rescued germinal center, MZ B, and B1 cell
formation in Cd19 -/- mice, which exhibit reduced activation of PI3K
(see PIK3CG; 601232). Anzelon et al. (2003) concluded that intracellular
phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate has a central role in the
regulation of differentiation of peripheral B-cell subsets.

Using immunohistochemistry and flow cytometric analysis, You et al.
(2009) demonstrated that Signr1 (see CD209; 604672)-positive MZ
macrophages were absent and Cd11c (ITGAX; 151510)-positive MZ dendritic
cells were abnormally distributed in Cd19 -/- mice. Adoptively
transferred normal mouse B cells could reconstitute MZ B cells in Cd19
-/- mice and restore MZ macrophage and dendritic cell distribution. In
contrast, Cd19 -/- B cells failed to enter the MZ of normal mice. You et
al. (2009) concluded that MZ B cells are required for MZ macrophage
differentiation and MZ dendritic cell localization, but that MZ B-cell
deficiency in Cd19 -/- mice is due to a defect of intrinsic B-cell
signaling.

Saito et al. (2002) found that B cells of 'tight-skin' (Tsk/+) mice (see
134797), a model for human systemic sclerosis, had decreased IgM
expression, enhanced serum IgG production, spontaneous autoantibody
production, and enhanced Cd19 tyrosine phosphorylation, Vav
phosphorylation, and Lyn kinase activity. Tsk/+ mice deficient in Cd19
expression showed decreased skin fibrosis, upregulated surface IgM
expression, abrogation of hypergammaglobulinemia and autoantibody
production, and inhibition of Il6 (147620) production. Saito et al.
(2002) concluded that chronic B-cell activation resulting from augmented
Cd19 signaling in Tsk/+ mice leads to skin sclerosis and autoimmunity,
possibly through overproduction of Il6.

IMMUNODEFICIENCY, COMMON VARIABLE, 3
CD19, 1-BP INS, 972A

In a Turkish girl, born of consanguineous parents, who had common
variable immunodeficiency-3 (613493), van Zelm et al. (2006) identified
homozygosity for an insertion of an adenine in exon 6 of the CD19 gene.
This insertion caused a frameshift, resulting in a premature stop codon
at the intracellular amino acid 328. The patient had a history of
recurrent bronchiolitis and bronchopneumonia starting at 1 year of age
and meningitis starting at 8 years of age. A diagnosis of postinfectious
glomerulonephritis was made at the age of 10 years, at which time she
was found to have hypogammaglobulinemia.

CD19, 2-BP DEL, 1384GA

In 3 sibs, offspring of unrelated parents of Colombian descent, examined
at ages 35, 33, and 49 years of age, respectively, for common variable
immunodeficiency (613493), van Zelm et al. (2006) identified
homozygosity for a dinucleotide deletion of guanine and adenine in exon
11 of the CD19 gene, resulting in a premature stop codon at the
intracellular amino acid 465. The parents and several members of the
family were heterozygous for the mutation but had no clinical features
of immunodeficiency. All 3 sibs had had otitis media, sinusitis, and
pharyngitis during childhood. In addition, 1 had had 4 bouts of
pneumonia between the ages of 18 and 35 years; he had received diagnoses
of bacterial conjunctivitis and chronic gastritis (Helicobacter pylori
infection). The study showed that the disruption of CD19 signaling
results in a primary antibody deficiency, mainly characterized by a poor
antigen-specific response. Normal levels of CD19 transcripts were found
in B cells from all patients.

607362	TITLE *607362 RGM DOMAIN FAMILY, MEMBER A; RGMA
;;REPULSIVE GUIDANCE MOLECULE; RGM
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Monnier et al. (2002) cloned and characterized a chicken
membrane-associated glycoprotein, RGM, that is a repulsive guidance
molecule for retinal axons. Chick RGM contains a signal peptide, an RGD
site, a von Willebrand factor (VWF; 613160) domain, a hydrophobic
region, and a GPI (glycosylphosphatidylinositol) anchor. Its mRNA is
distributed in a gradient with increasing concentration from the
anterior to posterior pole of the embryonic tectum of chicken.
Recombinant RGM at low nanomolar concentration induced collapse of
temporal but not of nasal growth cones and guided temporal retinal axons
in vitro, demonstrating its repulsive and axon-specific guiding
activity.

Wiemann et al. (2001) isolated a cDNA corresponding to human RGM
(GenBank GENBANK AL136826).

GENE FUNCTION

Rajagopalan et al. (2004) presented evidence that neogenin (NEO1;
601907) functions as a receptor for Rgm. Like Rgm, neogenin was
expressed in a gradient across the embryonic chicken retina. The
avoidance of Rgm by chicken temporal retinal axons was blocked by
anti-neogenin antibody and the soluble neogenin ectodomain. Dorsal root
ganglion axons were unresponsive to Rgm, but were converted to a
responsive state by neogenin expression.

Matsunaga et al. (2004) found that neogenin overexpression and Rgm
downexpression in the developing embryonic chicken neural tube induced
apoptosis. The proapoptotic activity of neogenin in immortalized
neuronal cells and in the neural tube was associated with cleavage of
its cytoplasmic domain by caspases.

Muramatsu et al. (2011) found that mouse dendritic cells expressed Rgma
mRNA and protein and that mouse Cd4 (186940)-positive T cells expressed
neogenin. Human RGMA bound mouse Cd4-positive T cells in a
concentration-dependent manner and enhanced adhesion in a Rap1 (see
605061)-dependent manner. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated
increased expression of Rgma in mice with experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis (EAE) and in brains and spinal cords of deceased
patients with multiple sclerosis (MS; see 126200). Neogenin was also
expressed in mice with EAE and in human MS tissues, but its expression
levels did not differ from controls. Treatment of mice with an antibody
to Rgma attenuated clinical signs of EAE and diminished T-cell responses
and cytokine secretion. Treatment with an RGMA-specific antibody also
reduced proliferative and cytokine responses of T cells from MS
patients. Muramatsu et al. (2011) concluded that an RGMA-specific
antibody suppresses T-cell responses, and they suggested that RGMA is a
potential target for treating MS.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Wiemann et al. (2001) mapped the human RGM gene to
15q26.1.

607041	TITLE *607041 ATP-BINDING CASSETTE, SUBFAMILY C, MEMBER 12; ABCC12
;;MULTIDRUG RESISTANCE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 9; MRP9
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Tammur et al. (2001) identified ABCC12 and ABCC11 (607040) by database
analysis using ABC transporter sequences as queries. The deduced
1,359-amino acid ABCC12 protein contains 2 ATP-binding domains and 2
transmembrane regions. It shares 42% amino acid sequence identity with
ABCC5 (605251). PCR of a 16-tissue panel revealed expression only in
testis, ovary, and prostate.

Yabuuchi et al. (2001) cloned ABCC12 from an adult liver cDNA library
after identifying the putative ABC transporter by database analysis of a
BAC clone. The deduced 1,359-amino acid protein shares about 47%
identity with ABCC11 and contains 12 putative transmembrane domains. PCR
analysis of multiple human tissues revealed near ubiquitous expression.
The authors identified 4 ABCC12 splice variants in cDNA libraries of
adult liver, pancreas, testis, and fetal thymus. These variants, which
they designated A, B, C, and D, are identical to the full-length protein
in their N-terminal halves. After exon 19, exon skipping and alternative
splicing leads to deletions in the second halves of the variants and the
addition of a stop codon. Variants A, B, and D encode proteins of 1,009,
935, and 1,009 amino acids, respectively. They contain only 8 or 9
transmembrane domains and lack the C-terminal domain with the second
ATP-binding cassette. The cDNA for variant C contains 2 open reading
frames encoding proteins of 1,009 and 331 amino acids, respectively. By
sequence analysis of numerous ABCC12 cDNA clones, Yabuuchi et al. (2001)
determined that expression of the splice variants significantly exceeds
expression of the full-length clone.

Bera et al. (2002) cloned a variant of ABCC12, which they called MPR9,
from a testis cDNA library. Sequence analysis indicated that MPR9
consists of 26 exons and, in comparison to the sequence reported by
Tammur et al. (2001), it lacks exons 5, 16, and 26 and shows alternative
splicing at exon 22, resulting in a stop codon. The deduced 930-amino
acid protein contains 8 membrane-spanning domains and a single
nucleotide-binding domain. They also identified a small variant encoding
a deduced 233-amino acid protein, resulting from use of an alternate
transcription start site at exon 23, that contains the
nucleotide-binding domain missing in the longer sequence. By dot blot
analysis and PCR, Bera et al. (2002) detected expression in testis,
pancreas, ovary, skeletal muscle, and various brain regions. Northern
blot and dot blot analyses using variant-specific probes revealed a
4.5-kb transcript expressed in testis, normal breast, and breast cancer
tissues, and a 1.3-kb transcript in brain, skeletal muscle, and ovary.
In situ hybridization of normal and cancerous breast tissue revealed
stronger staining in tumor cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Tammur et al. (2001) determined that the ABCC12 gene contains 29 exons.
They found that the ABCC11 and ABCC12 genes were located tandemly,
separated by about 200 kb, with the 5-prime ends facing the centromere.

Yabuuchi et al. (2001) determined that the ABCC12 gene spans 63 kb and
that the separation between ABCC11 and ABCC12 is about 20 kb.

MAPPING

Tammur et al. (2001) mapped the ABCC12 gene to chromosome 16q12.1 by
radiation hybrid analysis and by the presence of ABCC12 within a BAC
clone. They stated that chromosomal localization, potential function,
and expression profiles of the ABCC11 and ABCC12 genes make them
promising candidates for paroxysmal kinesigenic choreoathetosis (PKC;
128200) and infantile convulsions with paroxysmal choreoathetosis (ICCA;
602066).

604397	TITLE *604397 GUANINE NUCLEOTIDE-BINDING PROTEIN, ALPHA-14; GNA14
DESCRIPTION For background information on G proteins, see 600874.

Rubio et al. (1999) constructed a YAC contig of the choreoacanthocytosis
(CHAC; 200150) critical region on chromosome 9q21. Using a PCR-based
strategy with primers from the mouse G-alpha-14 gene, they cloned a
full-length human G-alpha-14 (GNA14) cDNA from the contig. GNA14, which
contains 7 exons, encodes a predicted 355-amino acid protein that is 98%
and 99% identical to the mouse and bovine proteins, respectively. Rubio
et al. (1999) established the genetic structure of both the GNA14 and
GNAQ (600998) genes, which are situated in a head-to-tail arrangement
(cen--GNAQ--GNA14--qter). Northern blot analysis revealed that
expression of GNAQ is ubiquitous, whereas that of GNA14 is restricted to
fetal lung and kidney. Mutation analysis of GNAQ and GNA14 in 10 CHAC
individuals identified no changes likely to cause the disease.

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Rubio et al. (1999) confirmed the
assignment of the GNA14 gene to 9q21.

611850	TITLE *611850 MITOCHONDRIAL RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN L45; MRPL45
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Mitochondria have their own translation system for production of 13
inner membrane proteins essential for oxidative phosphorylation. MRPL45
is a component of the large subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome that
is encoded by the nuclear genome (Koc et al., 2001).

CLONING

By searching databases using bovine Mrpl45 as query, Koc et al. (2001)
identified human MRPL45. They also identified MRPL45 homologs in mouse,
Drosophila, and C. elegans, but not in yeast, E. coli, or Arabidopsis.
Mouse and human MRPL45 share 79.4% amino acid identity.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Zhang and Gerstein (2003) mapped the
MRPL45 gene to chromosome 17q21.31. They identified MRPL45 pseudogenes
on chromosomes 2 and 17.

300304	TITLE *300304 CULLIN 4B; CUL4B
;;KIAA0695
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Kipreos et al. (1996) identified the cullin gene family, which includes
at least 5 members in nematodes, 6 in humans, and 3 in S. cerevisiae.
Human CUL4A (603137) and CUL4B are orthologs of nematode cul4. The
partial C-terminal amino acid sequences of CUL4A and CUL4B share 88%
identity. Rasooly (1998) found that a brain cDNA isolated by Ishikawa et
al. (1998), KIAA0695, was 99% identical to CUL4B. Using RT-PCR, Ishikawa
et al. (1998) determined that KIAA0695 is expressed ubiquitously.

Tarpey et al. (2007) reported that the CUL4B gene encodes a protein of
913 amino acids. The cullin domain is located between amino acid
residues 217 and 815 and is characterized a by C-terminal globular
domain (cullin homology domain) and a series of N-terminal repeats
(cullin repeats).

GENE STRUCTURE

The CUL4B gene contains 22 exons (Tarpey et al., 2007).

MAPPING

Although Ishikawa et al. (1998) mapped the KIAA0695 gene to human
chromosome 10, Rasooly (1998) noted the presence of sequences in GenBank
(GENBANK AC002476) identical to CUL4B within a cloned region in Xq23.
Tarpey et al. (2007) placed the CUL4B gene in Xq24.

GENE FUNCTION

Zhong et al. (2003) showed that the CUL4 ubiquitin ligase temporally
restricts DNA replication licensing in Caenorhabditis elegans.
Inactivation of CUL4 causes massive DNA rereplication, producing cells
with up to 100C DNA content. The C. elegans ortholog of the
replication-licensing factor CDT1 (605525) is required for DNA
replication. C. elegans CDT1 is present in G1-phase nuclei but
disappears as cells enter S phase. In cells lacking CUL4, CDT1 levels
failed to decrease during S phase and instead remained constant in the
rereplicating cells. Removal of 1 genomic copy of CDT1 suppressed the
CUL4 rereplication phenotype. Zhong et al. (2003) proposed that CUL4
prevents aberrant reinitiation of DNA replication, at least in part, by
facilitating the degradation of CDT1.

By mass spectrometric analysis, Higa et al. (2006) identified over 20
WD40 repeat-containing (WDR) proteins that interacted with the CUL4-DDB1
(600045)-ROC1 (RBX1; 603814) complex. Sequence alignment revealed that
most of the interacting WDR proteins had a centrally positioned WDxR/K
submotif. Knockdown studies suggested that the WDR proteins functioned
as substrate-specific adaptors. For example, inactivation of L2DTL (DTL;
610617), but not other WDR proteins, prevented CUL4-DDB1-dependent
proteolysis of CDT1 following gamma irradiation. Inactivation of WDR5
(609012) or EED (605984), but not other WDR proteins, altered the
pattern of CUL4-DDB1-dependent histone H3 (see 602810) methylation.

Ohtake et al. (2007) characterized a fat-soluble ligand-dependent
ubiquitin ligase complex in human cell lines, in which dioxin receptor
(AHR; 600253) is integrated as a component of a novel cullin-4B
ubiquitin ligase complex, CUL4B(AHR). Complex assembly and ubiquitin
ligase activity of CUL4B(AHR) in vitro and in vivo are dependent on the
AHR ligand. In the CUL4B(AHR) complex, ligand-activated AHR acts as a
substrate-specific adaptor component that targets sex steroid receptors
for degradation. Ohtake et al. (2007) concluded that their findings
uncovered a function for AHR as an atypical component of the ubiquitin
ligase complex and demonstrated a nongenomic signaling pathway in which
fat-soluble ligands regulate target protein-selective degradation
through a ubiquitin ligase complex.

Kerzendorfer et al. (2010) showed that cells from patients with mental
retardation, macrocephaly, tremor, and peripheral neuropathy (300354)
and CUL4B mutations exhibited sensitivity to camptothecin (CPT),
impaired CPT-induced topoisomerase I (TOP1; 126420) degradation and
ubiquitination, suggesting that TOP1 may be a novel CUL4-dependent
substrate. These cells exhibited increased levels of CPT-induced DNA
breaks, as well as overexpression of the known CUL4-dependent substrates
CDT1 and p21 (CDKN1A; 116899).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Tarpey et al. (2007) undertook a systematic mutational screen of the X
chromosome in 250 families with multiple members with mental retardation
to provide an alternative strategy to positional cloning. The approach
was not dependent on mapping by genetic linkage and was a direct search
for putative disease-causing mutations. Each family in this screen had a
normal karyotype by conventional 500 G-banding resolution and was
negative for an expansion of the trinucleotide repeat in the FMR1 gene
(309550). They identified 3 truncating, 2 splice site, and 3 missense
variants at conserved amino acids in the CUL4B gene in 8 of the 250
families with X-linked mental retardation. During the adolescence of the
affected subjects, a syndrome emerged with delayed puberty,
hypogonadism, relative macrocephaly, moderate short stature, central
obesity, unprovoked aggressive outbursts, fine intention tremor, pes
cavus, and abnormalities of the toes. This syndrome was first described
by Cabezas et al. (2000) (300354) in a family that was included in the
study of Tarpey et al. (2007); see 300304.0001.

Tarpey et al. (2009) sequenced the coding exons of the X chromosome in
208 families with X-linked mental retardation. They identified 5
nonrecurrent mutations in the CUL4B gene that segregated completely with
mental retardation in the families and were not identified in unaffected
family members. In addition to mental retardation, affected family
members had relative macrocephaly, hypogonadism, central obesity, and
tremor.

In a family reported by Wei et al. (1993) with X-linked mental
retardation in 5 affected males in 4 sibships, Zou et al. (2007)
narrowed the candidate interval on Xq25 and identified a nonsense
mutation in the CUL4B gene (300304.0004). The mutation occurred in exon
9 and truncated the protein before the C-terminal domain. Since the C
terminus is required for the formation of the catalytic core, the
truncated peptide was predicted to have no function. The nonsense
mutation also resulted in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay in patients. In
peripheral leukocytes of obligate carriers, a strong selection against
cells expressing the mutant allele resulted in an extremely skewed
X-chromosome inactivation pattern. The findings pointed to the
functional significance of CUL4B in cognition and in other aspects of
human development. Protein ubiquitination regulates the functions of a
broad spectrum of protein substrates in diverse cellular pathways. Many
human genetic disorders have been found to be caused by errors in
ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation (Jiang and Beaudet, 2004).
For example, lack of expression of UBE3A (601623), a gene that encodes
an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, causes Angelman syndrome (105830), which
is characterized by mental retardation, ataxia, absence of speech, and
other features. Opitz syndrome (300000), which is associated with
midline abnormalities--such as cleft lip, laryngeal cleft, heart
defects, and hypospadias--and with mental retardation, is caused by an
impairment of the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of the MID1 protein
(300552). UBE2A (312810), a gene encoding ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme
E2, has been identified to be the cause of a type of syndromic XLMR
(312180). These findings suggested that ubiquitylation is critical in
cognition as well as other aspects of human development.

In a patient with X-linked mental retardation with relative
macrocephaly, short stature, lack of speech development, hypogonadism,
and abnormal gait, Isidor et al. (2010) identified a 60-kb de novo
deletion at chromosome Xq24 that encompassed the 3-prime region of the
CUL4B gene and the MCTS1 gene (300587). Isidor et al. (2010) concluded
that the deletion would result in premature termination and
nonsense-mediated mRNA decay of CUL4B.

Ravn et al. (2012) identified a maternally inherited 28-kb deletion at
Xq24 in a pair of male monozygotic twins with moderate mental
retardation and pronounced language deficit, short stature, truncal
obesity, relative macrocephaly, characteristic facial dysmorphism,
tremor, and seizures. Using quantitative PCR, Ravn et al. (2012) mapped
the proximal breakpoint within intron 4 of CUL4B and the distal
breakpoint 1,000 bp downstream of the 3-prime UTR. X-inactivation
studies in the unaffected mother revealed an extremely skewed
X-inactivation pattern, consistent with her being an unaffected carrier.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MENTAL RETARDATION, X-LINKED, WITH SHORT STATURE, HYPOGONADISM, AND
ABNORMAL GAIT
CUL4B, ARG572CYS

In a family with X-linked mental retardation with short stature,
hypogonadism, and abnormal gait (300354), Tarpey et al. (2007) described
a 1714C-T transition in exon 14 of the CUL4B gene, giving rise to an
arg572-to-cys (R572C) amino acid substitution. Residue R572 is highly
conserved throughout evolution and is located within the cullin domain,
and the arginine-to-cysteine change is a nonconservative substitution.
This was the family originally reported by Cabezas et al. (2000) and
comprised 6 affected individuals in 2 generations and 4 sibships
connected through carrier females.

.0002
MENTAL RETARDATION, X-LINKED, WITH SHORT STATURE, HYPOGONADISM, AND
ABNORMAL GAIT
CUL4B, ARG388TER

In a family in which 3 males in 2 sibships in 2 generations with
syndromic X-linked mental retardation (300354), Tarpey et al. (2007)
described an 1162C-T transition in exon 9 of the CUL4B gene that caused
an arg388-to-ter (R388X) mutation.

In a Chinese family originally reported by Wei et al. (1993), Zou et al.
(2007) identified a nonsense mutation in the CUL4B gene as the cause of
a syndromic form of X-linked mental retardation. All affected members in
this family had a R388X substitution, which Zou et al. (2007) stated
resulted from a 1564C-T transition in exon 9 (a different numbering
system was used). The mutation rendered the peptide completely devoid of
the C-terminal catalytic domain. Mutant mRNA was degraded by
nonsense-mediated decay (NMD).

.0003
MENTAL RETARDATION, X-LINKED, WITH SHORT STATURE, HYPOGONADISM, AND
ABNORMAL GAIT
CUL4B, IVS6, A-G, -2

In a family in which 3 brothers had X-linked mental retardation with
short stature, hypogonadism, and abnormal gait (300354), Tarpey et al.
(2007) found a splice acceptor site mutation leading to premature
termination of the CUL4B protein: 901-2A-G. To investigate the effect of
this variant on splicing, CUL4B exons 6 through 11 were amplified.
Sequence analysis demonstrated that the mutated exon 7 splice acceptor
site is ignored, with the result that exon 7 (74 bp) was excluded from
the mature transcript. Removal of exon 7 resulted in a translational
frameshift, with the inclusion of 7 novel amino acids and a premature
termination at codon 308.

604632	TITLE *604632 VAC14, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; VAC14
;;ASSOCIATED REGULATOR OF PIKFYVE; ARPIKFYVE;;
TAX1-BINDING PROTEIN 2; TAX1BP2;;
TAX-REACTIVE PROTEIN X; TRX
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The content of phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,5)P2) in
endosomal membranes changes dynamically with fission and fusion events
that generate or absorb intracellular transport vesicles. VAC14 is a
component of a trimolecular complex that tightly regulates the level of
PtdIns(3,5)P2. Other components of this complex are the
PtdIns(3,5)P2-synthesizing enzyme PIKFYVE (609414) and the PtdIns(3,5)P2
phosphatase FIG4 (609390). VAC14 functions as an activator of PIKFYVE
(Sbrissa et al., 2007).

CLONING

Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type-1 (HTLV-1) encodes Tax1, a 40-kD
protein that plays a key role in viral replication, transformation, and
gene regulation. By screening a human Jurkat T-cell cDNA expression
library with biologically active Tax1 protein to identify Tax1-binding
proteins, Mireskandari et al. (1996) isolated a cDNA encoding VAC14,
which they called TRX. The deduced 221-amino acid TRX protein is
predominantly hydrophilic in its C-terminal region. Northern blot
analysis of human tissues detected a major 3.5-kb TRX transcript in all
tissues examined, namely brain, heart, lung, liver, pancreas, kidney,
skeletal muscle, and placenta. However, Western blot analysis detected
TRX expression only in lymphocytes and lymphocytic-derived cell lines.

Sbrissa et al. (2004) obtained a full-length cDNA clone of human VAC14.
The deduced protein contains 782 amino acids. Western blot analysis of
human and other mammalian cell lines and of mouse tissues detected VAC14
at an apparent molecular mass of 82 kD. Fractionation and Western blot
analysis of HEK293 human embryonic kidney cells revealed endogenous
VAC14 in both cytosolic and membrane compartments. Immunohistochemical
analysis of transfected COS cells showed that human VAC14 localized
predominantly to the perinuclear region and also in more dispersed
vesicles.

HEAT repeats contain 2 antiparallel helices connected by a short loop
and provide surfaces for protein-protein interactions. Jin et al. (2008)
identified 17 HEAT repeats in mouse and human VAC14.

GENE FUNCTION

Mireskandari et al. (1996) demonstrated a specific interaction between
Tax1 and TRX by coimmunoprecipitation and Far Western blot analyses.

Using immunohistochemical analysis, Sbrissa et al. (2004) showed that
human VAC14 colocalized with mouse Pikfyve in the perinuclear region
following cotransfection of COS cells. Knockdown of VAC14 expression in
HEK293 cells did not alter cell morphology, but it sensitized cells to
brief treatment with a weak base, which resulted in formation of
cytoplasmic vacuoles and decreased production of PtsIns(3,5)P and
PtdIns(5)P by PIKFYVE. Conversely, overexpression of VAC14 in HEK293
cells increased PIKFYVE protein levels and PIKFYVE activity. Reciprocal
coimmunoprecipitation studies showed that endogenous Pikfyve and Vac14
interacted directly in rat PC12 cells, and the immunoprecipitates
synthesized PtdIns(5)P and PtdIns(3,5)P2. Sbrissa et al. (2004)
concluded that VAC14 is an activator of PIKFYVE, and thereby regulates
PtdIns(3,5)P2 synthesis and intracellular membrane homeostasis.

Using coimmunoprecipitation analysis, Sbrissa et al. (2007) showed that
endogenous PIKFYVE, ARPIKFYVE, and SAC3 (FIG4) formed a stable ternary
complex in HEK293 cells and other mammalian cell lines.

Sbrissa et al. (2008) found that ARPIKFYVE interacted with both SAC3 and
PIKFYVE and concluded that it is the principal organizer of the
PIKFYVE-ARPIKFYVE-SAC3 (PAS) complex.

MAPPING

Gross (2010) mapped the VAC14 to chromosome 16q22.1-q22.2 based on an
alignment of the VAC14 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK056433) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

Jin et al. (2008) mapped the mouse Vac14 gene to chromosome 8.

ANIMAL MODEL

Zhang et al. (2007) obtained Vac14-null mice at mendelian ratios, but
all died within 2 days of birth due to massive neurodegeneration,
particularly in the midbrain and in peripheral sensory neurons. Cell
bodies of affected neurons were vacuolated, and empty spaces were found
in areas where neurons should have been. Similar vacuoles were found in
cultured Vac14-null neurons and fibroblasts. Defects were observed in
intracellular trafficking, particularly in retrograde
endosome-to-trans-Golgi trafficking. Vac14-null cells showed abnormal
accumulation of PI(3)P and reduced levels of PI(3,5)P2 and PI(5)P
compared with wildtype cells. Overexpression of human FAB1 reversed the
effect of Vac14 deletion in mouse fibroblasts. Zhang et al. (2007) noted
that Fig4-null mice and Vac14-null mice show similar defects in PI(3,5)2
synthesis and acquire profound vacuolation in the same types of neurons.
They speculated that the neurodegeneration observed in both mouse
mutants is due to defects in metabolism of PI(3,5)P2 and/or PI(5)P, and
they concluded that VAC14 and FIG4 control FAB1 activity to maintain
normal levels of PI(3)P, PI(3,5)P2, and PI(5)P.

Mice homozygous for the spontaneous Ingls (infantile gliosis) mutation
exhibit reduced body size and diluted pigmentation. Homozygous Ingls
mice die within 3 weeks of birth and histologically show enlarged brain
ventricles. Jin et al. (2008) identified Ingls as a missense mutation
resulting in substitution of an invariant leu156 with arg within helix B
of HEAT repeat 4 in the Vac14 protein. Western blot analysis of Ingls
brains revealed normal Vac14 protein abundance, but cultured Ingls
fibroblasts showed reduced PtdIns(3,5)P2 levels. Yeast 2-hybrid analysis
showed that the leu156-to-arg mutation disrupted interaction of Vac14
with Fab1 (Pikfyve), but not Fig4.

Mutations affecting the conversion of PI3P to the signaling lipid
PI(3,5)P2 result in spongiform degeneration of mouse brain and are
associated with the human disorders Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Ferguson et al. (2009) reported
accumulation of the proteins Lc3II (MAP1LC3A; 601242), p62 (SQSTM1;
601530), and Lamp2 (309060) in neurons and astrocytes of mice with
mutations in 2 components of the PI(3,5)P2 regulatory complex, Fig4
(609390) and Vac14. Cytoplasmic inclusion bodies containing p62 and
ubiquitinated proteins were present in regions of the mutant brain that
underwent degeneration. Colocalization of p62 and LAMP2 in affected
cells indicated that formation or recycling of the autolysosome may be
impaired. The authors proposed a role for PI(3,5)P2 in autophagy in the
mammalian central nervous system and demonstrated that mutations
affecting PI(3,5)P2 may contribute to inclusion body disease.

608660	TITLE *608660 INSULIN-INDUCED GENE 2; INSIG2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The gated movement of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (see
SREBP2; 600481) from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi complex
is the central event in lipid homeostasis in animal cells. SREBPs
activate genes encoding enzymes required for synthesis of cholesterol,
fatty acids, triglycerides, and phospholipids. In the presence of
sterols, INSIG2 regulates lipid synthesis by blocking the proteolytic
activation of SREBPs by SCAP (601510) and causing SREBPs to be retained
in the ER (Yabe et al., 2002).

CLONING

By searching an EST database for proteins homologous to INSIG1 (602055),
Yabe et al. (2002) identified INSIG2. The deduced 225-amino acid protein
contains 6 membrane-spanning helices. Northern blot analysis detected
Insig2 expression in several mouse tissues, with highest expression in
liver. Human INSIG2 shares 97%, 95%, and 80% amino acid identity with
mouse, hamster and zebrafish Insig2, respectively; most variation occurs
in the hydrophilic N- and C-terminal sequences. INSIG2 shares 59% amino
acid identity with INSIG1.

Yabe et al. (2003) cloned a liver-specific Insig2 variant, which they
designated Insig2a, in mouse and rat. Insig2a differs from the
ubiquitous transcript, Insig2b, only in the promoter region; the
protein-coding sequences are identical.

GENE FUNCTION

Yabe et al. (2002) showed that INSIG2 restored sterol-dependent
inhibition of SREB2 and SREBP1a (184756) processing in transfected
Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells overexpressing SCAP. The inhibition of
SREBP processing resulted in a lack of nuclear SREBP.
Coimmunoprecipitation of proteins from transfected CHO cells confirmed
that INSIG2 binds the SCAP/SREBP2 complex only in the presence of
sterols.

Yabe et al. (2003) showed that the liver-specific Insig2a isoform was
expressed in fed mice and that its expression was downregulated by
insulin. Insig2a mRNA increased when mice were fasted, and its
expression declined when they were refed. Expression of the transcript
also increased following streptozoticin-induced diabetes in rats, and
its expression was reduced when insulin was injected. Yabe et al. (2003)
hypothesized that the insulin-mediated decrease in Insig2a expression
may allow Srebp1c to be processed, thereby allowing insulin to stimulate
fatty acid synthesis, even under conditions in which hepatic cholesterol
levels are elevated.

Asp205 in INSIG1 and asp149 in INSIG2 are conserved residues that abut
the fourth transmembrane helix at the cytosolic side of the ER membrane.
Gong et al. (2006) found that mutation of these residues to alanine
resulted in INSIG proteins that were unable to bind SCAP and suppress
cleavage of SREBPs. The mutant INSIGs were also ineffective in
accelerating sterol-stimulated degradation of 3-hydroxy-2-methylglutaryl
CoA reductase.

GENE STRUCTURE

Yabe et al. (2003) determined that the mouse Insig2 gene contains 3
exons. The first 2 exons are alternatively spliced and contain the
5-prime UTRs, whereas the common third exon encodes the open reading
frame.

MAPPING

Herbert et al. (2006) noted that the INSIG2 gene maps to chromosome
2q14.1.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

For discussion of an association between variation upstream of the
transcription start site of the INSIG2 gene and obesity, see BMIQ13
(612459).

ANIMAL MODEL

Takaishi et al. (2004) infected Zucker diabetic fatty rats (see 601007)
with recombinant adenovirus containing Insig1 or Insig2 cDNA.
Triacylglycerols in the liver and plasma of control diabetic rats rose
steeply, whereas the Insig-infected rats exhibited substantial
attenuation of hepatic steatosis and hyperlipidemia. Insig
overexpression was also associated with a reduction in the elevated
level of nuclear Srebp1c and reduced expression of Srebp1c lipogenic
target enzymes. In normal animals, overexpression of the Insigs reduced
the increase in Srebp1c mRNA and its target enzymes caused by refeeding.
Takaishi et al. (2004) concluded that both Insigs have antilipogenic
action.

Engelking et al. (2005) found that, whereas cholesterol feeding reduced
nuclear Srebps and lipogenic mRNAs in wildtype mice, this feedback
response was severely blunted in Insig1/Insig2 double-knockout mice, and
synthesis of cholesterol and fatty acids was not repressed.

;;ASPARAGINYL-tRNA SYNTHETASE, MITOCHONDRIAL;;
MITOCHONDRIAL ASNRS
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching databases for aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases containing a
mitochondrial targeting sequence, Bonnefond et al. (2005) identified
NARS2, which the called mitochondrial ASNRS. The deduced 477-amino acid
protein has an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting signal with a
predicted cleavage site after residue 14. NARS2 has characteristics of a
class II mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase and is expected to
function as a dimer.

GENE STRUCTURE

Bonnefond et al. (2005) determined that the NARS2 gene contains 14 exons
and spans 137.8 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Bonnefond et al. (2005) mapped the NARS2
gene to chromosome 11.

;;TRIMERIC INTRACELLULAR CATION CHANNEL TYPE A; TRICA;;
MITSUGUMIN 33
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

In the course of screening membrane proteins participating in cellular
calcium handling, Yazawa et al. (2007) identified a protein with a
calculated molecular mass of 33,300 from rabbit skeletal muscle, and
called it trimeric intracellular cation channel (TRIC) type A. The
authors identified TRIC channel subtypes TRICA and TRICB (611236) from
several species, including human. TRICA contains 3 proposed
transmembrane segments, and forms homotrimers with a bullet-like
structure. Northern blot analysis of mouse tissues indicated that TRICA
is preferentially expressed in excitable tissues, including striated
muscle and brain. Western blot analysis of fractionated muscle membranes
suggested that TRICA is distributed throughout the sarcoplasmic
reticulum but not in the cell surface membranes. In further
immunochemical studies antibodies to TRICA decorated the sarcoplasmic
reticulum and nuclear membranes in skeletal muscle. In limited
proteolysis analysis using membrane vesicles, Yazawa et al. (2007) found
that the amino terminus of TRICA is located in the sarcoplasmic
reticulum/endoplasmic reticulum lumen, whereas the carboxy terminus of
TRICA is exposed to the cytoplasm.

ANIMAL MODEL

Yazawa et al. (2007) generated knockout mice lacking TRICA. Trica-null
mice were viable and fertile. Trica/Tricb double knockout mice exhibited
a weak heartbeat at embryonic day 9.5 and subsequent loss of
cardiomyocyte viability, leading to terminal embryonic cardiac lethality
beyond embryonic day 10.5. These data suggested that TRIC subtypes share
complementary physiologic functions. TRIC-deficient skeletal muscle
sarcoplasmic reticulum showed reduced potassium permeability, as well as
altered calcium ion 'spark' signaling and voltage-induced calcium
release. Therefore, Yazawa et al. (2007) concluded that TRIC channels
are likely to act as counter-ion channels that function in
synchronization and calcium release from intracellular stores.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The KIAA0319 gene encodes a plasma membrane protein with a large, highly
glycosylated, extracellular domain. This protein is proposed to function
in adhesion and attachment and may play a role during neuronal migration
in the developing brain. In addition, cleavage of the protein may play a
role in intra- and extracellular signaling (summary by Velayos-Baeza et
al., 2010).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1997) cloned KIAA0319. The deduced 1,072-amino
acid protein has an apparent molecular mass of over 100 kD by SDS-PAGE.
RT-PCR detected low expression only in brain. The predicted size of the
full-length protein is 116 kD (Velayos-Baeza et al., 2010).

Cope et al. (2005) noted that 4 polycystic kidney disease (PKD) domains
in KIAA0319 show homology to the extracellular domains of PKD1 (601313),
which are involved in cell adhesive functions.

Paracchini et al. (2006) found expression of KIAA0319 in the developing
mouse and human brain. In mice, there was low expression in the frontal
neocortex, ganglionic eminence, mesencephalon, and cerebellum at
embryonic day (E) 13.5. Staining was more intense at E15.5 in the
cerebral neocortex and mesencephalon. By E18.5, when neuronal migration
is largely completed, KIAA0319 was expressed prominently in the cortical
plate (CP) and in the remnant of the ventricular zone (VZ), with less
intense expression in the subventricular zone (SVZ). In the adult mouse
brain, there was intense expression of KIAA0319 in the CA3 region of the
hippocampus and dentate gyrus, and in the Purkinje cell layer of the
cerebellum. In human fetal brain, KIAA0319 expression was found in the
developing neocortex, ganglionic eminence, CP, and VZ.

By database analysis and RT-PCR of adult and fetal whole brain,
Velayos-Baeza et al. (2007) identified a number of KIAA0319 splice
variants. Most alternative splicing affects the 5-prime UTR, coding
exons 2 through 4 at the 5-prime end, and coding exons 18 through 20 at
the 3-prime end. The dominant transcript, variant A, uses all exons. The
deduced full-length 1,072-amino acid protein has an N-terminal signal
peptide, followed by a 'motif at the N terminus with 7 cysteines'
(MANSC), 5 central tandem PKD domains, a motif with 6 cysteines (C6), a
transmembrane domain, and a short C terminus, as well as putative N- and
O-glycosylation sites. The common variants B and C lack exon 19 and
exons 19 and 20, respectively, and encode proteins lacking the
C-terminal transmembrane domain. Northern blot analysis detected a major
transcript of 7.5 to 8 kb that was widely expressed in brain, notably in
cerebellum, cerebral cortex, putamen, amygdala, and hippocampus. Weaker
expression of transcripts of about 4.5 and 2.5 kb was also detected.
Alternative splicing patterns similar, but not identical, to those
observed for human KIAA0319 were detected in the mouse and rat
orthologs.

Velayos-Baeza et al. (2008) found that the MANSC domain of KIAA0319
(Velayos-Baeza et al., 2007) is actually a MANEC (motif at the N
terminus with eight cysteines) domain. Using coimmunoprecipitation and
Western blot analysis of epitope-tagged proteins, Velayos-Baeza et al.
(2008) determined that KIAA0319 isoform A predominantly formed dimers
under nonreducing conditions; however, monomers and higher order
oligomers were also observed. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that
isoform A localized to the plasma membrane of transfected human lung
fibroblasts and that the N terminus was extracellular and the C terminus
was cytoplasmic. Biochemical analysis confirmed that isoform A was N-
and O-glycosylated. Isoforms B and C, which lack the transmembrane
domain, were secreted into the culture medium and retained in the
endoplasmic reticulum, respectively.

GENE STRUCTURE

Velayos-Baeza et al. (2007) determined that the KIAA0319 gene contains
21 exons and spans 102 kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1997) mapped the KIAA0319
gene to chromosome 6. Cope et al. (2005) noted that the KIAA0319 gene
resides within a dyslexia susceptibility region on chromosome 6p22.2
(DYX2; 600202).

GENE FUNCTION

Using deletion and mutation analyses, Velayos-Baeza et al. (2008) showed
that the transmembrane domain of the full-length KIAA0319 isoform was
necessary for plasma membrane localization. The C6 domain was required
for dimerization, and the transmembrane domain strengthened dimer
interactions.

Levecque et al. (2009) observed that KIAA0319 often colocalized with the
early endosomal marker EEA1 (605070) in juxtanuclear vesicles in human
cell lines. Internalization of KIAA0319 was dependent on RAB5 (179512),
a key regulator of early endocytosis. Yeast 2-hybrid and protein
pull-down assays showed that KIAA0319 interacted with the mu-2 subunit
(AP2M1; 601024) of the adaptor protein-2 (AP2) complex, which is
involved in internalization of proteins through the clathrin (see CLTC;
118955)-mediated endocytosis pathway. Deletion and mutation analysis
revealed that the YTIL motif in the cytoplasmic juxtamembrane region of
KIAA0319 mediated the interaction of KIA0319 with AP2 mu-2. Mutation of
Y995 within this motif prevented binding between KIAA0319 and AP2 mu-2.
RNA interference-mediated depletion of AP2 mu-2 or CLTC in HeLa cells
prevented internalization of KIAA0319. Levecque et al. (2009) concluded
that surface expression of KIAA0319 is regulated by the classical
clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathway.

By in vitro studies of HEK293 cells, Velayos-Baeza et al. (2010) showed
that KIAA0319 undergoes ectodomain shedding and intramembrane cleavage,
releasing N-terminal fragments, including the MANEC domain, into the
extracellular domain, and C-terminal intracellular fragments into the
cytoplasm. The process involved at least 5 different cleavage events, 4
in the extracellular domain and 1 within the transmembrane domain, but
the cleavage was not carried out by gamma-secretase (see PSEN1; 104311).
The soluble cytoplasmic domain of KIAA0319 translocated to the nucleus
and accumulated in nucleoli, suggesting a possible indirect role in the
regulation of gene expression. These results suggested that KIAA0319 may
have signaling functions in addition to a direct role in neuronal
migration.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

For a discussion of a possible association between variation in the
KIAA0319 gene and dyslexia, see DYX2 (600202).

In individuals with dyslexia, Francks et al. (2004) found an association
between dyslexia and a 77-kb region on chromosome 6p22.2 spanning the
TTRAP gene (605764) and the first 4 exons of KIAA0319. One main risk
haplotype (1-1-2) for reading disability (frequency of approximately
12%) was found in both U.K. and U.S. samples: the 1-1-2 haplotype
comprised dbSNP rs4504469, dbSNP rs2038137, and dbSNP rs2143340.

Cope et al. (2005) found that 6 SNPs in the 6p22.2 region showed
significant evidence of association with dyslexia, including a SNP in
exon 4 of the KIAA0319 gene that changed an amino acid (A311T, dbSNP
rs4504469). Haplotype data implicated KIAA0319 as a susceptibility gene
for dyslexia.

In lymphoblastoid and neuroblastoma cell lines, Paracchini et al. (2006)
found that heterozygosity for the 1-1-2 haplotype identified by Francks
et al. (2004) resulted in a decrease of KIAA0319 expression by about
40%, but did not affect expression of the neighboring TTRAP or THEM2
genes. The effect on gene expression could not be detected by looking at
individual SNPs, but only by the haplotype background. The authors used
matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF)
mass spectrometry to assess quantitative allele-specific transcripts.
Paracchini et al. (2006) noted that reading disability may be related to
irregularities in neuronal migration, and suggested that downregulation
of KIAA0319 may be a susceptibility factor in the development of
dyslexia when combined with other genetic and environmental factors.

ANIMAL MODEL

Paracchini et al. (2006) found expression of KIAA0319 in the developing
rodent brain. RNA interference (RNAi) of KIAA0319 in rats disrupted
neuronal migration and caused migrating neurons to assume an orthogonal
rather than parallel orientation to radial glial fibers. The findings
were suggestive of a role for KIAA0319 in neuronal migration during
formation of the cerebral cortex.

611056	TITLE *611056 SELENOCYSTEINE LYASE; SCLY
;;SCL
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Selenocysteine lyase (SCLY; EC 4.4.1.16) catalyzes the pyridoxal 5-prime
phosphate-dependent conversion of L-selenocysteine to L-alanine and
elemental selenium (Mihara et al., 2000).

CLONING

By database analysis using porcine Scly as probe, followed by screening
a mouse liver cDNA library and human EST libraries, Mihara et al. (2000)
cloned a full-length mouse Scly cDNA and identified a partial human SCLY
cDNA sequence. The deduced mouse protein has 432 amino acids. RT-PCR
detected Scly expression in mouse brain, heart, lung, stomach, liver,
kidney, spleen, and testis. Western blot analysis detected expression in
all mouse tissues examined, with the highest expression in liver,
kidney, and testis. Mouse Scly localized to the cytosolic fraction in
mouse liver and formed homodimers.

GENE FUNCTION

Mihara et al. (2000) showed that mouse Scly catalyzed the conversion of
L-selenocysteine to L-alanine. Scly activity required pyridoxal 5-prime
phosphate, was specific to L-selenocysteine, and showed maximum
reactivity at pH 9.0.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the human
SCLY gene to chromosome 2 (TMAP SHGC-81267).

605324	TITLE *605324 AMYLOID BETA PRECURSOR PROTEIN-BINDING PROTEIN 2; APPBP2
;;PROTEIN INTERACTING WITH APP TAIL 1; PAT1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Epithelial cell surfaces are divided into apical and basolateral
domains. The basolateral sorting of cell surface proteins depends on the
presence of peptide-based basolateral sorting signals (BaSS) in the
cytoplasmic domains of proteins. Amyloid precursor protein (APP;
104760), a basolateral protein implicated in the pathogenesis of
Alzheimer disease (AD; 104300), contains a tyrosine-based BaSS. Mutation
of the tyrosine results in nonpolarized transport of APP. Using APP-BaSS
as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a HeLa cell cDNA library, followed
by negative selection with a tyr-ala mutant APP-BaSS as bait and 5-prime
RACE, Zheng et al. (1998) isolated a cDNA encoding amyloid beta
precursor protein-binding protein-2 (APPBP2), which they called PAT1
(protein interacting with APP tail-1). The deduced 585-amino acid
hydrophilic APPBP2 protein, which is identical to the uncharacterized
KIAA0228 protein identified by Nagase et al. (1996), lacks signal or
transmembrane sequences but contains N- and C-terminal globular
structures, a coiled coil domain, several protein kinase C
phosphorylation sites, and 4 imperfect C-terminal tandem repeats.
Binding analysis determined that APPBP2 binds specifically to the
tyrosine-containing APP-BaSS and to the complete cytoplasmic domain of
APP; it does not bind to mutant APP-BaSS. Western blot analysis showed
that APPBP2 is present as a 70-kD protein in both cytosolic and,
together with APP, membrane-associated cell fractions.
Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated that APPBP2 is present in the
Golgi region and that its distribution overlaps that of APP. SDS-PAGE
and immunoblotting showed that APPBP2 interacts with microtubules and is
functionally associated with APP transport and/or processing. By
Northern blot analysis, Nagase et al. (1996) detected ubiquitous
expression of KIAA0228 as an approximately 6.5-kb transcript.

MAPPING

Nagase et al. (1996) mapped the APPBP2 gene to chromosome 17 by
radiation hybrid analysis.

Li et al. (2002) noted that the APPBP2 gene lies within 100 kb of the
PPM1D gene (605100) on 17q22-q23 and suggested that its amplification in
breast cancer is probably the secondary consequence of its proximity to
PPM1D, as it alone did not induce any oncogenic phenotype when
overexpressed.

608568	TITLE *608568 MYOSIN, HEAVY CHAIN 14, NONMUSCLE; MYH14
;;NONMUSCLE MYOSIN HEAVY CHAIN IIC;;
NMHC IIC;;
KIAA2034
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MYH14 is a member of the nonmuscle myosin II family of ATP-dependent
molecular motors, which interact with cytoskeletal actin and regulate
cytokinesis, cell motility, and cell polarity (Golomb et al., 2004).

CLONING

By sequence analysis and RT-PCR of sciatic nerve RNA, Leal et al. (2003)
cloned MYH14. The deduced 1,995-amino acid protein has a calculated
molecular mass of 228 kD. MYH14 contains an N-terminal myosin domain, a
myosin head region, 2 IQ domains, and a C-terminal myosin tail. It
shares significant similarity with MYH9 (160775), MYH10 (160776), and
MYH11 (160745), with highest conservation in the myosin head domain.
Northern blot analysis detected a 7.0-kb transcript expressed at highest
levels in small intestine, colon, and skeletal muscle. By EST analysis
and RT-PCR of colon and peripheral nerve RNA, Leal et al. (2003)
identified several splice variants resulting from exon skipping and the
use of alternate acceptor and donor sites.

Golomb et al. (2004) cloned mouse and human MYH14 and identified 2
splice variants of each. Northern blot analysis of several human tissues
detected highest expression in skeletal muscle. Expression was also
detected in brain, heart, colon, kidney, liver, small intestine, and
lung, but not in thymus, spleen, placenta, and lymphocytes. RNA dot blot
analysis detected elevated MYH14 expression in corpus callosum. Little
MYH14 was detected in organs composed mainly of smooth muscle, such as
aorta, uterus, and bladder. Human fetal tissues showed little or no
MYH14 expression compared with adult tissues. Immunofluorescent
microscopy of developing mouse embryos revealed Myh14 expression in the
developing sensory area of the cochlea and in the apical area of
intestinal epithelial cells. This pattern of expression differed from
those displayed by Myh9 and Myh10

Choi et al. (2011) demonstrated MYH14 expression in human skeletal
muscle by quantitative real-time PCR.

GENE FUNCTION

By immunoprecipitation of mouse lung proteins, Golomb et al. (2004)
demonstrated that Myh14 forms a homodimer and does not form heterodimers
with either Myh9 or Myh10. Recombinant MYH14, expressed in insect cells,
bound to skeletal muscle actin in the absence of MgATP and was released
in the presence of MgATP.

Kim et al. (2005) found that the mouse Myh14 isoform containing an
8-amino acids insertion in loop 1 had higher MgATPase activity and
supported more rapid in vitro actin-filament sliding activity than the
Myh14 isoform without the insertion.

GENE STRUCTURE

Leal et al. (2003) determined that the MYH14 gene contains 41 exons and
spans 108 kb. Exon 1 is untranslated.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Leal et al. (2003) mapped the MYH14 gene
to chromosome 19q13.33. Golomb et al. (2004) mapped the mouse Myh14 gene
to chromosome 7.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

MYH14 was considered a strong candidate gene for hearing loss because it
maps to the same region of chromosome 19 as does a form of autosomal
dominant nonsyndromic sensorineural deafness (DFNA4; 600652), and
because a number of unconventional and conventional myosins are known to
be involved in various forms of hereditary deafness. After demonstrating
that Myh14 is highly expressed in mouse cochlea, Donaudy et al. (2004)
performed mutation screening of the MYH14 gene in a series of 300
hearing-impaired patients from Italy, Spain, and Belgium, and in a
German kindred linked to the DFNA4 region. They identified 1 nonsense
(608568.0001) and 2 missense (608568.0002-608568.0003) mutations in
large pedigrees linked to DFNA4, as well as a de novo allele in a
sporadic case (608568.0004). These mutations were not found in 200
healthy control individuals.

By genomewide linkage analysis followed by candidate gene sequencing of
a large Korean family with autosomal dominant peripheral neuropathy,
myopathy, hoarseness, and hearing loss (PNMHH; 614369), Choi et al.
(2011) identified a heterozygous mutation in the MYH14 gene (R941L;
608568.0006). The phenotype was characterized by onset around age 10
years of progressive distal muscle weakness and atrophy, affecting the
lower limbs more than the upper limbs. Older individuals developed
hoarseness and sensorineural hearing loss. Sensation was not affected,
although most had decreased or absent deep tendon reflexes. Laboratory
studies suggested a myopathic and neurogenic process.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
DEAFNESS, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT 4
MYH14, SER7TER

In affected members of a 4-generation German kindred with autosomal
dominant nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing loss (600652) that mapped to
the DFNA4 region of chromosome 19, Donaudy et al. (2004) identified a
20C-A transversion in exon 1 of the MYH14 gene, resulting in a
ser7-to-ter (S7X) change in the motor domain of the protein. Affected
individuals showed progressive sensorineural hearing impairment that
started in the first or second decade of life and led to severe to
profound hearing loss in the fourth decade of life.

.0002
DEAFNESS, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT 4
MYH14, LEU976PHE

In affected members of an Italian family with autosomal dominant
nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing loss (600652), Donaudy et al. (2004)
identified heterozygosity for a 2926C-T transition in exon 22 of the
MYH14 gene, resulting in a leu976-to-phe (L976F) change in the tail of
the protein. Affected members in this family had a mild to moderate
bilateral sensorineural hearing impairment without vestibular symptoms.

.0003
DEAFNESS, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT 4
MYH14, ARG726SER

In affected members of a large Belgian kindred with autosomal dominant
nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing loss (600652), Donaudy et al. (2004)
identified a 2176C-A transversion in exon 16 of the MYH14 gene,
resulting in an arg726-to-ser (R726S) change in the tail of the protein.
The patients showed a mild to moderate progressive hearing loss without
vestibular involvement.

Kim et al. (2005) found that a mutation homologous to R726S in mouse
Myh14 (R230S) had no effect on its actin-activated MgATPase activity,
but it decreased the rate of actin-filament sliding.

.0004
DEAFNESS, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT 4
MYH14, GLY376CYS

In a 9-year-old Italian patient with autosomal dominant nonsyndromic
sensorineural hearing loss (600652), Donaudy et al. (2004) identified a
1126G-T transversion in exon 9 of the MYH14 gene, resulting in a
gly376-to-cys (G376C) change in the motor domain of the protein. The
patient apparently represented a de novo mutation. The patient had a
moderate bilateral sensorineural hearing loss without vestibular
involvement.

.0005
DEAFNESS, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT 4
MYH14, SER120LEU

In affected members of a 4-generation German family with autosomal
dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss (600652), Yang et al. (2005)
identified a 466C-T transition in exon 1 of the MYH14 gene, predicting a
ser120-to-leu (S120L) substitution. Audiogram profiles of affected
members were characterized by moderate hearing loss across all
frequencies tested.

.0006
PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY, MYOPATHY, HOARSENESS, AND HEARING LOSS
MYH14, ARG941LEU

In affected members of a large Korean family with autosomal dominant
inheritance of peripheral neuropathy, myopathy, hoarseness, and hearing
loss (PNMHH; 614369), Choi et al. (2011) identified a heterozygous
2822G-T transversion in the MYH14 gene, resulting in an arg941-to-leu
(R941L) substitution in a highly conserved residue in the tail domain.
The mutation was not found in 566 control chromosomes. The mutation was
found by genomewide linkage analysis followed by candidate gene
sequencing.

176842	TITLE *176842 PROTEASOME SUBUNIT, ALPHA-TYPE, 2; PSMA2
;;HC3;;
PSC2
DESCRIPTION Proteasomes (multicatalytic proteinase complexes) are symmetric,
ring-shaped or cylindrical cytoplasmic particles with the unusually
large size of 20S (Mr approximately 750,000). They are composed of
polysubunits of similar sizes (Mr 21,000-32,000) but different charges.
They are ubiquitously distributed in eukaryotic cells at considerably
high concentrations, suggesting their general importance in cellular
functions. Proteasomes have been demonstrated to catalyze an
energy-dependent degradative process in a nonlysosomal pathway. Tamura
et al. (1991) reported molecular cloning and sequencing of full-length
cDNAs for 5 subunits of proteasomes which they symbolized HC2 (602854),
HC3, HC5 (602017), HC8 (176843), and HC9 (PSMA4; 176846). The
proteasomes of human liver were studied with description of their
structure and homology with the subunits of proteasomes from other
species. The 5 subunits had 263, 234, 241, 255, and 261 amino acid
residues and calculated molecular weights of 29,554, 25,897, 26,847,
28,431, and 29,482, respectively. They were encoded by single
independent genes. Most of the genes for proteasome components are
highly homologous and their proteins show approximately 30% identity in
amino acid sequence. The exception is component 5 (PSMA5; 176844), which
may have diverged in eukaryotes during evolution.

Tamura et al. (1994) isolated 2 human proteasome genes encoding the
alpha-type HC3 and the beta-type HC5 subunits. Analysis of their
promoter sequences revealed the absence of TATA and CAAT elements and
the existence of 2 or 3 GC boxes that function coordinately as promoters
of the 2 genes. Differences in the exon/intron organizations of these
genes, however, suggested that they diverged at an early stage of
evolution.

Okumura et al. (1995) mapped the PSMA2 gene to 6q27 by fluorescence in
situ hybridization.

603302	TITLE *603302 ADENYLATE CYCLASE 9; ADCY9
;;ADENYLYL CYCLASE 9
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The adenylyl cyclases (EC 4.6.1.1) are membrane-associated enzymes that
are expressed in most human tissues. These enzymes catalyze the
formation of cAMP and are regulated by a family of G protein-coupled
receptors, protein kinases, and calcium.

CLONING

Adenylate cyclase-9 (ADCY9) is a widely distributed adenylyl cyclase
that was originally cloned from mouse (Paterson et al., 1995; Premont et
al., 1996). Hacker et al. (1998) cloned human cardiac ADCY9 cDNAs and
found that the deduced 1,294-amino acid protein is 90% identical to
mouse Adcy9. Like mouse Adcy9, the predicted human ADCY9 protein
contains 12 transmembrane domains, Asn-linked glycosylation sites, and
cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation sites; however, these
proteins differ in the C2b domain due to a frameshift in the human ADCY9
coding sequence relative to the coding sequence of mouse Adcy9. Northern
blot analysis detected 8.5- and 6.3-kb ADCY9 transcripts in all human
tissues examined.

By semiquantitative RT-PCR, Ludwig and Seuwen (2002) found that human
ADCY9 was highly expressed in colon, moderately expressed in lung,
kidney, spleen, testis, and ovary, and weakly expressed in most other
tissues examined.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ludwig and Seuwen (2002) determined that the ADCY9 gene contains 11
exons and spans 153 kb.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Hacker et al. (1998) mapped the
human and mouse ADCY9 genes to 16p13.3 and chromosome 16 band B1,
respectively.

GENE FUNCTION

Hacker et al. (1998) found that ADCY9 is stimulated by beta-adrenergic
receptor (see ABRB2; 109690) activation but is insensitive to forskolin,
calcium, and somatostatin (182450). In contrast to mouse Adcy9, the
activity of human ADCY9 is unaffected by inhibitors of calcineurin (see
114107).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Toyota et al. (2002) studied polymorphisms of the ADCY9 gene in relation
to mood disorders and found no significant association in Japanese.

In asthma (see 600807), the response to beta-agonists acting at
beta-2-adrenergic receptors displays extensive interindividual
variation. Tantisira et al. (2005) identified a 2316A-G transition
resulting in ile772-to-met (I772M; dbSNP rs2230739) substitution in the
C1b region of the catalytic domain. In stably transfected A431 squamous
carcinoma cells, met772 resulted in decreased catalytic activity
compared to wildtype ile772. However, cells expressing met772 cultured
in the presence of glucocorticoid had a significantly increased
albuterol-stimulated adenylyl cyclase response when compared with those
expressing ile772 (80% vs 20%; p = 0.02). An equivalent increase in
ADRB2 expression was observed in both lines due to glucocorticoid, but
ADCY9 expression was unaffected. Among 436 asthmatic children, met772
carriers on budesonide, an inhaled corticosteroid, showed a significant
improvement in forced expiratory volume compared to control treatment.
Moreover, a highly significant interaction was found for budesonide
treatment and the ADCY9 polymorphism. Tantisira et al. (2005) concluded
that this ADCY9 polymorphism alters albuterol responsiveness in the
context of concomitant inhaled corticosteroid administration, which may
provide a predictor for pharmacologic responsiveness.

;;TELOMERASE CATALYTIC SUBUNIT; TCS1;;
EST2
CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Human telomeres consist of many kilobases of (TTAGGG)n together with
various associated proteins. Small amounts of these terminal sequences
are lost from the tips of the chromosomes each S phase because of
incomplete DNA replication, but de novo addition of TTAGGG repeats by
the enzyme telomerase compensates for this loss. Many human cells
progressively lose terminal sequence with cell division, a loss that
correlates with the apparent absence of telomerase in these cells
(Kipling, 1995).

CLONING

Morin (1989) identified the ribonucleoprotein telomerase in HeLa cells.

Catalytic subunits of telomerase from the ciliate Euplotes aediculatus
and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae contain reverse transcriptase
motifs. Nakamura et al. (1997) identified homologous genes from the
fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe and human. The human gene
encodes a 1,132-amino acid polypeptide with a predicted molecular mass
greater than 100 kD. Sequence comparisons placed the telomerase proteins
in the reverse transcriptase family but revealed hallmarks that
distinguish them from related retroviral and retrotransposon enzymes.
Thus, the proposed telomerase catalytic subunits are phylogenetically
conserved and represents a deep branch in the evolution of reverse
transcriptases.

Meyerson et al. (1997) cloned a human gene that shares significant
sequence similarity with the telomerase catalytic subunit genes of lower
eukaryotes. They referred to the gene as EST2, using the designation of
the gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The human EST2 gene was expressed
at high levels in primary tumors, cancer cell lines, and
telomerase-positive tissues, but was undetectable in telomerase-negative
cell lines and differentiated telomerase-negative tissues.

Independently, Kilian et al. (1997) cloned the human telomerase
catalytic subunit gene, which they symbolized TCS1.

Wick et al. (1999) identified a novel TERT splice variant.

Moriarty et al. (2005) stated that the TERT protein contains an
N-terminal RNA-interaction domain (RID1), followed by a linker region, a
second RNA-interaction domain (RID2), a central reverse transcriptase
domain, and a C-terminal domain.

GENE FUNCTION

Morin (1989) found that human telomerase recognized a single-stranded
G-rich telomere primer and added multiple telomeric repeats to its
3-prime end by using an RNA template in vitro.

Wilkie et al. (1990) found that a case of human alpha-thalassemia was
caused by a truncation of chromosome 16 that had been healed by the
addition of telomeric repeats (TTAGGG)n. Using an in vitro assay, Morin
(1991) showed that human telomerase correctly recognized the chromosome
16 breakpoint sequence and added the repeats indicated. They suggested
that telomerase-based chromosome healing may stabilize a broken
chromosome and allow its stable inheritance. The Miller-Dieker syndrome
(247200) and the Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome (194190) are other examples of
terminal chromosome deletions.

Nakamura et al. (1997) found that disruption of the S. pombe telomerase
gene resulted in telomere shortening and senescence, and expression of
mRNA from the human gene correlated with telomerase activity in cell
lines.

Meyerson et al. (1997) found that the human EST2 transcript was
upregulated concomitant with activation of telomerase during
immortalization of cultured cells and was downregulated during in vitro
cellular differentiation. These observations suggested that induction of
EST2 mRNA expression is required for the telomerase activation that
occurs during cellular immortalization and tumor progression.

Activation of telomerase, the enzyme that synthesizes the telomere ends
of linear chromosomes, has been implicated in human cell immortalization
and cancer cell pathogenesis. Enzyme activity is undetectable in most
normal cells and tissues, but present in immortal cells and cancer
tissues. Kolquist et al. (1998) used in situ hybridization to study TERT
expression at the single-cell level in normal tissues and in various
stages of tumor progression. In normal tissues, including some known to
be telomerase-negative, TERT mRNA was present in specific subsets of
cells thought to have long-term proliferative capacity. This included
mitotically inactive breast lobular epithelium in addition to some
actively regenerating cells such as the stratum basale of the skin. TERT
expression appeared early during tumorigenesis in vivo, beginning with
early preinvasive changes in human breast and colon tissues and
increasing gradually during progression, both in the amount of TERT mRNA
present within the individual cells and in the number of expressing
cells within a neoplastic lesion. The physiologic expression of TERT
within normal epithelial cells that retained proliferative potential and
its presence at the earliest stages of tumorigenesis have implications
for the regulation of telomerase expression and for the identification
of cells that may be targets for malignant transformation.

Fossel (1998) reviewed the status of studies examining the relationship
between telomerase activity and the aging process, as well as the
implications of these studies for human health.

The ectopic expression of telomerase in normal human cells extends their
replicative life span. Although telomerase expression is a hallmark of
cancer, both Jiang et al. (1999) and Morales et al. (1999) found that
cells with forced expression of the TERT gene retained normal growth
control and displayed no changes associated with the malignant
transformation, such as growth in soft agar or tumor formation in vivo.

The MYC protooncogene (190080) encodes a ubiquitous transcription factor
involved in the control of cell proliferation and differentiation.
Deregulated expression of MYC caused by gene amplification, retroviral
insertion, or chromosomal translocation is associated with
tumorigenesis. Understanding of the function of MYC and its role in
tumorigenesis was aided by the demonstration by Wu et al. (1999) that
MYC has a direct role in induction of the activity of telomerase, the
ribonucleoprotein complex expressed in proliferating and transformed
cells, in which it preserves chromosome integrity by maintaining
telomere length. They found that MYC activates telomerase by inducing
expression of its catalytic subunit, telomerase-reverse transcriptase
(TERT). TERT and MYC are expressed in normal and transformed
proliferating cells, and are downregulated in quiescent and terminally
differentiated cells; both can induce immortalization when
constitutively expressed in transfected cells. Consistent with the
reported association between MYC overexpression and induction of
telomerase activity (Wang et al., 1998), Wu et al. (1999) found that the
TERT promoter contains numerous MYC binding sites that mediate TERT
transcriptional activation. MYC-induced TERT expression is rapid and
independent of cell proliferation and additional protein synthesis,
consistent with direct transcriptional activation of TERT. The results
indicated that TERT is a target of MYC activity and identified a pathway
linking cell proliferation and chromosome integrity in normal and
neoplastic cells.

Hahn et al. (1999) found that ectopic expression of TERT in combination
with 2 oncogenes, the simian virus 40 (SV40) large-T oncoprotein and an
oncogenic allele of HRAS (190020), resulted in direct tumorigenic
conversion of normal human epithelial and fibroblast cells. When cells
expressing large-T, HRAS, and TERT were introduced into nude mice,
rapidly growing tumors were repeatedly observed with high efficiency.
Cells carrying only large-T, large-T and HRAS, or large-T and TERT were
unable to form tumors in nude mice. The authors suggested that these
results demonstrated that disruption of the intracellular pathways
regulated by large-T, oncogenic ras, and telomerase suffices to create a
human tumor cell. Although expression of telomerase does not by itself
lead to a tumorigenic phenotype, telomere maintenance facilitated by
TERT expression in vivo might cooperate with additional oncogenic
mutations to create a malignantly transformed clone.

Wang et al. (2000) demonstrated that TERT-driven cell proliferation is
not genoprotective because it is associated with activation of the MYC
oncogene. Human mammary epithelial cells, which normally stop dividing
in culture at 55 to 60 population doublings (PDs), were infected with
human TERT retrovirus at PD40 and maintained until PD250. Wang et al.
(2000) then tested whether telomerase activity was essential for the
immortalized phenotype by excising the TERT retrovirus at PD150 using
Cre recombinase. The resulting cells were maintained for at least
another 20 population doublings, and no decline in growth rates in
either pooled cells or individual clones was observed. Ectopic
expression of MYC was found to be upregulated between 107 and 135
population doublings. Wang et al. (2000) suggested that under standard
culture conditions, extension of life span by telomerase selects for MYC
overexpression in human mammary epithelial cells.

Shay et al. (2001) reviewed the role of telomere shortening in cell
senescence, protein interactions with telomerase and telomeres, the use
of telomerase in cancer diagnostics, and anti-telomerase cancer
therapeutic approaches.

Cardiac muscle regeneration after injury is limited by 'irreversible'
cell cycle exit. Telomere shortening is one postulated basis for
replicative senescence, via downregulation of telomerase reverse
transcriptase (TERT); telomere dysfunction also is associated with
greater sensitivity to apoptosis. Oh et al. (2001) found that forced
expression of TERT in cardiac muscle in transgenic mice was sufficient
to rescue telomerase activity and telomere length. Initially, the
ventricle was hypercellular, with increased myocyte density and DNA
synthesis. By 12 weeks, cell cycling subsided; instead, cell enlargement
(hypertrophy) was seen, without fibrosis or impaired function. Likewise,
viral delivery of TERT was sufficient for hypertrophy in cultured
cardiac myocytes. The TERT virus and transgene also conferred protection
from apoptosis, in vitro and in vivo. Hyperplasia, hypertrophy, and
survival all required active TERT and were not seen with a catalytically
inactive mutation. Thus, TERT can delay cell cycle exit in cardiac
muscle, induce hypertrophy in postmitotic cells, and promote cardiac
myocyte survival.

Increased expression of survivin (603352) was shown to be a negative
predictor of survival in patients with soft tissue sarcoma. In a study
of 89 adults with soft tissue sarcomas, Wurl et al. (2002) determined
that coexpression of survivin and TERT transcripts identifies patients
at high risk of tumor-related death.

Resting human lymphocytes do not have telomerase activity, but
activation by a variety of stimuli induces TERT expression and
telomerase activity. Yago et al. (2002) found that activated human T and
B lymphocytes expressed USF1 (191523) and the full-length isoform of
USF2 (600390), and that dimers of these proteins bound E boxes in the
TERT promoter and activated TERT expression. In contrast, resting human
T and B lymphocytes expressed both the N-terminally truncated isoform of
USF2 and full-length USF2, and the truncated isoform had a
dominant-negative effect on TERT expression induced by full-length USF2.

Masutomi et al. (2003) demonstrated that the rate-limiting telomerase
catalytic subunit TERT is expressed in cycling primary presenescent
human fibroblasts, which were previously thought to lack TERT expression
and telomerase activity. Disruption of telomerase activity in normal
human cells slowed cell proliferation, restricted cell life span, and
altered the maintenance of the 3 single-stranded telomeric overhang
without changing the rate of overall telomere shortening. These
observations supported the view that telomerase and telomere structure
are dynamically regulated in normal human cells and that telomere length
alone is unlikely to trigger entry into replicative senescence.

To explore telomerase regulation, Lin and Elledge (2003) employed a
general genetic screen in HeLa cells to identify negative regulators of
TERT. They discovered 3 tumor suppressor/oncogene pathways involved in
TERT repression. One, the MAD1 (602686)/MYC pathway, had been previously
implicated in TERT regulation. The second, SIP1 (ZEB2; 605802), a
transcriptional target of the TGF-beta (190180) pathway, mediates
TGF-beta-regulated repression of TERT. The third, the tumor suppressor
menin (613733), is a direct repressor of TERT. Depleting menin
immortalized primary human fibroblasts and caused a transformation
phenotype when coupled with expression of SV40 large and small T antigen
and oncogenic RAS.

To investigate whether the expression of telomerase subunits is
reflected in the malignant transition of pheochromocytomas, Boltze et
al. (2003) determined mRNA and/or protein expression in 28 benign and 9
malignant pheochromocytomas and compared the results with telomerase
activity. RT-PCR analysis revealed that TEP1 (601686) was ubiquitously
expressed. Telomerase RNA component (TERC; 602322) was found in all
malignant (100%) and in 13 of 28 (46%) benign pheochromocytomas. In
contrast, TERT was clearly associated with aggressive biologic behavior.
All of the malignant (100%) but only 2 of 28 benign (7%)
pheochromocytomas expressed TERT. HSP90 (140571) was increased in
malignant pheochromocytomas, but was also expressed at a lower level in
benign tumors. The authors concluded that TERT, HSP90, and telomerase
activity are upregulated in malignant cells of the adrenal medulla. The
common expression of TERT and telomerase activity thus represents an
additional prognostic marker that may identify more aggressive tumors.

By mutation analysis, Moriarty et al. (2005) determined that the RID1
and C-terminal domains of TERT contribute to the affinity of telomerase
for its substrate, and that RID1 may form part of the telomerase anchor
site.

Wang et al. (2005) found that transfection of human TERT into bovine
lens epithelial cells (BLECs) provided the cells with telomerase
activity and significantly extended their population doublings in
culture in a healthy but undifferentiated state. In contrast, control
BLECs underwent terminal differentiation after comparatively few
population doublings. Wang et al. (2005) demonstrated that TERT
prevented replicative senescence in BLECs by synthesizing new telomeres,
and that it inhibited BLEC differentiation by suppressing MEK (see
176872)/ERK (see 601795) signaling

Massard et al. (2006) found that short-term knockdown of TERT by small
interfering RNA (siRNA) had no adverse effect on the viability or
proliferation of HeLa and human colon carcinoma cell lines. However,
TERT depletion facilitated induction of apoptotic cell death by
chemotherapeutic agents, mitomycin C, and reactive oxygen species, but
not by the CD95 death receptor (TNFRSF6; 134637). BAX (600040), but not
p53 (TP53; 191170), was involved in the chemosensitizing effect of TERT
depletion. Depletion of TERT facilitated the conformational activation
of BAX induced by genotoxic agents, and BAX knockout abolished the
chemosensitizing effect of TERT siRNAs. Inhibition of mitochondrial
membrane permeabilization, which inhibited BAX, prevented induction of
cell death by the combination of TERT depletion and chemotherapeutic
agents. Massard et al. (2006) concluded that TERT inhibition facilitates
apoptosis induced through the mitochondrial pathway.

Cohen et al. (2007) purified human telomerase 10(8)-fold, with the final
elution dependent on the enzyme's ability to catalyze nucleotide
addition onto a DNA oligonucleotide of telomeric sequence, thereby
providing specificity for catalytically active telomerase. Mass
spectrometric sequencing of the protein components and molecular size
determination indicated an enzyme composition of 2 molecules each of
TERT, TERC, and dyskerin (DKC1; 300126).

Tomas-Loba et al. (2008) engineered mice to be cancer resistant via
enhanced expression of several tumor suppressors. Tert overexpression in
these mice improved the fitness of epithelial barriers, particularly
skin and intestine, and produced a systemic delay in aging accompanied
by extension of the median life span.

Venteicher et al. (2009) showed that TCAB1 (612661) associates with
TERT, established telomerase components dyskerin and TERC, and small
Cajal body RNAs (scaRNAs), which are involved in modifying splicing
RNAs. Depletion of TCAB1 by using RNA interference prevented TERC from
associating with Cajal bodies, disrupted telomerase-telomere
association, and abrogated telomere synthesis in telomerase. Thus,
Venteicher et al. (2009) concluded that TCAB1 controls telomerase
trafficking and is required for telomere synthesis in human cancer
cells.

Park et al. (2009) demonstrated that telomerase directly modulates
Wnt/beta-catenin (see 116806) signaling by serving as a cofactor in a
beta-catenin transcriptional complex. The telomerase protein component
TERT interacts with BRG1 (SMARCA4; 603254), a SWI/SNF-related chromatin
remodeling protein, and activates Wnt-dependent reporters in cultured
cells and in vivo. TERT serves an essential role in formation of the
anterior-posterior axis in Xenopus laevis embryos, and this defect in
Wnt signaling manifests as homeotic transformations in the vertebrae of
Tert-null mice. Chromatin immunoprecipitation of the endogenous TERT
protein from mouse gastrointestinal tract showed that TERT physically
occupies gene promoters of Wnt-dependent genes such as AXIN2 (604025)
and MYC (190080). Park et al. (2009) concluded that their data revealed
an unanticipated role for telomerase as a transcriptional modulator of
the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway.

Maida et al. (2009) demonstrated that TERT interacts with the RNA
component of mitochondrial RNA processing endoribonuclease (RMRP;
157660), the gene that is mutated in cartilage-hair hypoplasia (250250).
Human TERT and RMRP form a distinct ribonucleoprotein complex that has
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity and produces double-stranded RNAs
that can be processed into small interfering RNA (siRNA) in a Dicer
(606241)-dependent manner. The human TERT-RMRP RNA-dependent RNA
polymerase (RdRP) shows a strong preference for RNA templates that can
form 3-prime fold-back structures. Using RMRP as a template, the
TERT-RMRP RdRP produces double-stranded RNAs that are processed by Dicer
into 22-nucleotide double-stranded RNAs that contain 5-prime
monophosphate and 3-prime hydroxyl groups that are loaded into AGO2
(606229), confirming that these short RNAs represent endogenous siRNAs.
The involvement of human TERT in 2 syndromes characterized by stem cell
failure (cartilage-hair hypoplasia and dyskeratosis congenita, 127550)
suggested to Maida et al. (2009) that ribonucleoprotein complexes
containing TERT have a critical role in stem cell biology.

A cardinal feature of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS) is
acquisition of indefinite self-renewal capacity, which is accompanied by
induction of the telomerase reverse transcriptase gene TERT. Agarwal et
al. (2010) investigated whether defects in telomerase function would
limit derivation maintenance of iPS cells from patients with
dyskeratosis congenita (DKC). The authors showed that reprogrammed DKC
cells overcome a critical limitation in telomerase RNA component (TERC;
602322) levels to restore telomere maintenance and self-renewal. Agarwal
et al. (2010) discovered that TERC upregulation is a feature of the
pluripotent state, that several telomerase components are targeted by
pluripotency-associated transcription factors, and that in autosomal
dominant DKC, transcriptional silencing accompanies a 3-prime deletion
at the TERC locus. Agarwal et al. (2010) concluded that their results
demonstrated that reprogramming restores telomere elongation in DKC
cells despite genetic lesions affecting telomerase, and showed that
strategies to increase TERC expression may be therapeutically beneficial
in DKC.

Hoffmeyer et al. (2012) reported a molecular link between
Wnt/beta-catenin signaling and the expression of the telomerase subunit
Tert. Beta-catenin-deficient mouse embryonic stem cells have short
telomeres; conversely, embryonic stem cells expressing an activated form
of beta-catenin (beta-catenin(deltaEx3/+)) have long telomeres.
Hoffmeyer et al. (2012) showed that beta-catenin regulates Tert
expression through the interaction with Klf4 (602253), a core component
of the pluripotency transcriptional network. Beta-catenin binds to the
Tert promoter in a mouse intestinal tumor model and in human carcinoma
cells. Hoffmeyer et al. (2012) uncovered a theretofore unknown link
between the stem cell and oncogenic potential whereby beta-catenin
regulates Tert expression, and thereby telomere length, which could be
critical in human regenerative therapy and cancer.

GENE STRUCTURE

To investigate mechanisms of TERT gene expression, Cong et al. (1999)
cloned genomic sequences which encompassed the complete TERT
transcription unit. They found that the gene consists of 16 exons and 15
introns spanning approximately 35 kb. Transient transfections of
immortal human cells with potential regulatory 5-prime sequences linked
to a reporter, combined with deletion analysis of these sequences,
indicated that elements responsible for promoter activity are contained
within a region extending from 330 bp upstream of the ATG to the second
exon of the gene. Assays in different cell types showed that the human
TERT promoter is inactive in normal and in transformed pre-immortal
cells, but, like telomerase, it is activated with cell immortalization.
Sequence analysis showed that the TERT promoter is GC-rich, lacks TATA
and CAAT boxes, but contains binding sites for several transcription
factors that may be involved in its regulation. The abundance of these
sites suggested that TERT expression may be subject to multiple levels
of control and may be regulated by different factors in different
cellular contexts.

Wick et al. (1999) characterized the genomic organization and promoter
of the TERT gene. It encompasses more than 37 kb and contains 16 exons.
They showed that all insertion and deletion variants described to that
time most likely resulted from the use of alternative splice consensus
sequences in intron or exon regions.

Renaud et al. (2003) found that the TERT core promoter region just
upstream of the translation initiation site had bidirectional activity,
a common feature of TATA-less promoters. They identified a splicing
regulatory region upstream of the core promoter and 2 regions, one
upstream of the core promoter and the other within the 5-prime end of
the coding region, that negatively regulated TERT promoter activity.

MAPPING

By study of radiation hybrid analysis, Meyerson et al. (1997) mapped the
TERT gene to chromosome 5p15.33, close to marker D5S678.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Dyskeratosis Congenita

In all 6 affected members of a family with autosomal dominant
dyskeratosis congenita-2 (DKCA2; 613989), Armanios et al. (2005)
identified a heterozygous mutation in the TERT gene (187270.0007).
Anticipation of clinical features was observed, and all affected
individuals showed increased frequency of short telomeres compared to
unaffected family members.

Basel-Vanagaite et al. (2008) identified a heterozygous mutation in the
TERT gene (R631Q; 187270.0011) in affected members of an Iraqi Jewish
family with autosomal dominant dyskeratosis congenita-2.

Marrone et al. (2007) identified homozygous TERT mutations (187270.0012
and 187270.0013) in patients with a severe form of autosomal recessive
dyskeratosis congenita-4 (DKCB4; see 613989).

- Telomere-Related Pulmonary Fibrosis and/or Bone Marrow Failure
1

Mutations in the TERC gene cause short telomeres in autosomal dominant
congenital aplastic anemia of dyskeratosis congenita-1 (DKCA1; 127550)
and in some cases of apparently acquired aplastic anemia. Yamaguchi et
al. (2005) investigated whether mutations in genes for other components
of telomerase also occur in patients with aplastic anemia due to bone
marrow failure (PFBMFT1; 614742). They found 5 heterozygous,
nonsynonymous mutations in TERT (187270.0001-187270.0005) among 7
unrelated patients. Leukocytes from these patients had short telomeres
and low telomerase enzymatic activity. Three patients had a relative
with myelodysplastic syndrome, one of whom had acute myeloid leukemia.
In 1 family, 4 individuals with the mutation also had short telomeres
and reduced telomerase activity, but no evident hematologic abnormality.
The results of coexpression of wildtype TERT and TERT with aplastic
anemia-associated mutations in a telomerase-deficient cell line
suggested that haploinsufficiency was the mechanism of telomere
shortening due to TERT mutations.

Tsakiri et al. (2007) performed a genomewide linkage scan in 2 large
Caucasian families with interstitial lung disease, many cases of which
met the clinical criteria for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and found
linkage to chromosome 5p15 with a maximum lod score of 2.8. Sequencing
TERT, a candidate gene in the interval, revealed heterozygosity for a
missense mutation (187270.0008) and a frameshift mutation (187270.0009)
that cosegregated with pulmonary disease in the 2 families,
respectively. Analysis of the TERT gene in probands of 44 additional
unrelated families and 44 sporadic cases of interstitial lung disease
revealed 5 other heterozygous mutations. Although all family members
with pulmonary fibrosis were heterozygous for these mutations, some
carriers had no evidence of pulmonary disease; however, heterozygous
carriers of TERT mutations had some clinical features of DKC, including
anemia, osteoporosis or osteopenia, cirrhosis, and cancer. Mutation
carriers had shorter telomeres than age-matched family members without
the mutations. Tsakiri et al. (2007) concluded that mutations in TERT
that result in telomere shortening over time confer a dramatic increase
in susceptibility to adult-onset pulmonary fibrosis.

Armanios et al. (2007) screened 73 probands with familial idiopathic
pulmonary fibrosis for mutations in the TERT or TERC genes and
identified 5 mutations in TERT (see, e.g., 187270.0010) and 1 in TERC
(602322.0009) in 6 probands, respectively. Average telomere length was
significantly less in probands and asymptomatic mutation carriers than
in relatives who did not carry the mutation (p = 0.006), suggesting that
asymptomatic carriers may also be at risk for the disease. None of the
classic features of dyskeratosis congenita were seen in the 5 families
carrying a mutation in the TERT gene.

In affected members of 2 unrelated families with variable manifestations
of telomere-related pulmonary fibrosis and/or bone marrow failure-1,
Kirwan et al. (2009) identified 2 different heterozygous mutations in
the TERT gene. One mutation carrier presented with myelodysplastic
syndrome (MDS) and another with MDS/acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Each
family contained at least 1 asymptomatic member who carried the
mutation, suggesting incomplete penetrance and that the mutations are
risk factors for development of the disease. Mutation carriers had short
telomeres, and there was a correlation between shorter telomere length
and disease manifestation. Overall, Kirwan et al. (2009) identified TERT
or TERC mutations in 4 of 20 families presenting with MDS/AML.

- Susceptibility to Cutaneous Malignant Melanoma

Horn et al. (2013) reported a 4-generation family with malignant
melanoma segregating a T-to-G transversion at the -57 position from the
ATG translation start site of TERT (187270.0023). The mutation was found
in all 4 affected family members sequenced and in 1 of 4 unaffected
family members. Two family members had additional forms of cancer. This
mutation was not found among 140 sporadic melanoma cases, 165 healthy
controls, index cases from 34 Spanish melanoma families, or in dbSNP or
the 1000 Genomes databases. Horn et al. (2013) screened 168 melanoma
cell lines derived from sporadic cases of metasatic melanoma, none of
which carried the germline mutation found in the melanoma-prone family
studied by them. They identified recurrent ultraviolet signature
mutations in the TERT core promoter in 125 cell lines (74%), in 45 of 53
corresponding metastatic tumor tissues (85%) and in 25 of 77 (33%)
primary melanomas. Two frequent mutations, G-to-A (C-to-T on the
opposite strand) transitions at positions -124 and -146, were mutually
exclusive and occurred in 27% and 38% of cell lines, respectively. These
mutations generate binding motifs for Ets/TCF (ternary complex factor)
transcription factors. Among 77 paraffin-embedded primary melanoma
tumors, the -124G-A mutation was found in 7 (9%) and the -146G-A
mutation in 5 (7%).

Huang et al. (2013) independently found the -124G-A and -146G-A TERT
promoter mutations, which they called C228T and C250T, respectively, in
50 of 70 (71%) of melanomas examined. These mutations generate de novo
consensus binding motifs for ETS transcription factors and increased
transcriptional activity from the TERT promoter by 2- to 4-fold.
Examination of 150 cancer cell lines derived from diverse tumor types
revealed the same 2 mutations in 24 cases (16%) with preliminary
evidence of elevated frequency in bladder and hepatocellular cancer
cells. The C228T/-124G-A mutation occurs at genomic coordinate
Chr5:1,295,228 (GRCh37), and C250T/-146G-A at Chr5:1,295,250 (GRCh37).

- Other Disease Associations

Zhang et al. (2003) demonstrated that heterozygous deletion of TERT
occurred in all 10 patients with cri-du-chat syndrome (123450) whom they
examined. Induction of TERT mRNA in proliferating lymphocytes derived
from 5 of 7 patients was lower than that in unaffected control
individuals. The patient lymphocytes exhibited shorter telomeres than
age-matched unaffected individuals (P less than 0.0001). A reduction in
replicative life span and a high rate of chromosome fusions were
observed in cultured patient fibroblasts. Reconstitution of telomerase
activity by ectopic expression of TERT extended the telomere length,
increased the population doublings, and prevented the end-to-end fusion
of chromosomes.

Matsubara et al. (2006) found an association between a -1327T-C
polymorphism in the promoter region of the TERT gene (187270.0006) and
coronary artery disease and telomere length in Japanese patients.

Calado et al. (2009) found a significantly increased number of germline
mutations in the TERT gene in patients with sporadic acute myeloid
leukemia (AML; 601626) compared to controls. One mutation in particular,
A1062T (187270.0022), was 3-fold higher among 594 AML patients compared
to 1,110 controls (p = 0.0009). In vitro studies showed that the
mutations caused haploinsufficiency of telomerase activity. An abnormal
karyotype was found in 18 of 21 patients with TERT mutations who were
tested. Calado et al. (2009) suggested that telomere attrition may
promote genomic instability and DNA damage, which may contribute to the
development of leukemia.

gene and lung cancer, see 612571.

gene and glioma, see GLM8 (613033).

ANIMAL MODEL

Gonzalez-Suarez et al. (2002) developed transgenic mice with
overexpression of Tert targeted to basal keratinocytes of stratified
epithelia. They had previously found that, upon exposure to chemical
carcinogens, transgenic epithelia showed a higher susceptibility to
developing papillomas. Transgenics also showed a faster rate of wound
healing and a higher proliferation rate upon mitogenic stimuli than
wildtype animals. In order to determine the impact of telomerase
overexpression with aging, Gonzalez-Suarez et al. (2002) maintained
several transgenic founder lines for more than 2 years. In comparison to
wildtype controls, transgenics showed a decreased life span that was
associated with a higher incidence of preneoplastic and neoplastic
lesions in various tissues. Neoplasia was coincident with Tert
overexpression in affected tissues. The increased cancer incidence and
reduced viability was aggravated when the transgene was introduced into
a p53 +/- background.

Sarin et al. (2005) showed that conditional transgenic induction of Tert
in mouse skin epithelium causes a rapid transition from telogen (the
resting phase of the hair follicle cycle) to anagen (the active phase),
thereby facilitating robust hair growth. Tert overexpression promotes
this developmental transition by causing proliferation of quiescent,
multipotent stem cells in the hair follicle bulge region. Sarin et al.
(2005) demonstrated that this function for TERT does not require TERC,
which encodes the template for telomere addition, and therefore operates
through a mechanism independent of its activity in synthesizing telomere
repeats. Sarin et al. (2005) concluded that their data indicate that, in
addition to its established roles in extending telomeres, TERT can
promote proliferation of resting stem cells through a noncanonical
pathway.

Flores et al. (2005) showed through analysis of mouse models that
telomere length, as well as the catalytic component of telomerase, Tert,
are critical determinants in the mobilization of epidermal stem cells.
Telomere shortening inhibited mobilization of stem cells out of their
niche, impaired hair growth, and resulted in suppression of stem cell
proliferative capacity in vitro. In contrast, Tert overexpression in the
absence of changes in telomere length promoted stem cell mobilization,
hair growth, and stem cell proliferation in vitro. Flores et al. (2005)
concluded that the effects of telomeres and telomerase on stem cell
biology anticipate their role in cancer and aging.

Expression of TERT in human tissues is significantly different from that
in mouse tissues. Using transgenic mice expressing human TERT and
mutation analysis, Horikawa et al. (2005) determined that a nonconserved
GC box within the human TERT promoter is responsible for repression of
TERT expression in certain tissues, such as liver, kidney, lung, uterus,
and fibroblasts. They concluded that a difference in cis regulation of
transcription, rather than transacting transcription factors, is
critical to species differences in tissue-specific TERT expression.

Armanios et al. (2009) generated wildtype mice with short telomeres. In
these mice, Armanios et al. (2009) identified hematopoietic and immune
defects that resembled those present in patients with dyskeratosis
congenita (see 305000). Patients with dyskeratosis congenita have a
premature aging syndrome that can be caused by mutations in the RNA or
catalytic component of telomerase. When mice with short telomeres were
interbred, telomere length was only incrementally restored, and even
several generations later, wildtype mice with short telomeres still
displayed degenerative defects. Armanios et al. (2009) concluded that
their findings implicated telomere length as a unique heritable trait
and demonstrated that short telomeres are sufficient to mediate the
degenerative defects of aging.

Jaskelioff et al. (2011) sought to determine whether entrenched
multisystem degeneration in adult mice with severe telomere dysfunction
can be halted or possibly reversed by reactivation of endogenous
telomerase activity. To this end, they engineered a knock-in allele
encoding a 4-hydroxytamoxifen-inducible telomerase reverse
transcriptase-estrogen receptor (TERT-ER) under transcriptional control
of the endogenous TERT promoter. Homozygous TERT-ER mice had short
dysfunctional telomeres and sustained increased DNA damage signaling and
classical degenerative phenotypes upon successive generational matings
and advancing age. Telomerase reactivation in such late generation
TERT-ER mice extended telomeres, reduced DNA damage signaling and
associated cellular checkpoint responses, allowed resumption of
proliferation in quiescent cultures, and eliminated degenerative
phenotypes across multiple organs including testes, spleen, and
intestine. Notably, somatic telomerase reactivation reversed
neurodegeneration with restoration of proliferating Sox2 (184429)+
neural progenitors, Dcx (300121)+ newborn neurons, and Olig2 (606386)+
oligodendrocyte populations. Consistent with the integral role of
subventricular zone neural progenitors in generation and maintenance of
olfactory bulb interneurons, this wave of telomerase-dependent
neurogenesis resulted in alleviation of hyposmia and recovery of innate
olfactory avoidance responses. Jaskelioff et al. (2011) concluded that
accumulating evidence implicating telomere damage as a driver of
age-associated organ decline and disease risk, and the marked reversal
of systemic degenerative phenotypes in adult mice observed by them,
supported the development of regenerative strategies designed to restore
telomere integrity.

BONE MARROW FAILURE, TELOMERE-RELATED, 1
TERT, ALA202THR

In 2 unrelated patients with telomere-related bone marrow failure-1
(614742), Yamaguchi et al. (2005) identified heterozygosity for an
ala202-to-thr missense mutation (A202T) in exon 2 of the TERT gene.
Study of 1 patient's family suggested that short telomeres were
associated with the presence of the same mutation in 3 of 4 sibs of the
proband and in 1 of 2 daughters of the proband. No abnormalities in
peripheral blood cell counts were present in these carriers; only the
proband was pancytopenic. Telomere length in patient granulocytes was
less than 10% of control values, and cell lysates carrying the mutation
showed less than 1% telomerase activity.

In a Scottish man with autosomal recessive dyskeratosis congenita-4 (see
613989), Du et al. (2008) identified compound heterozygosity for H412Y
and P704S (187270.0014). Du et al. (2008) showed that the mutant H412Y
protein had 36% residual activity.

Matsubara et al. (2006) examined the -1327T-C promoter polymorphism in
104 Japanese male patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and 115
age-matched male controls and found an association between the -1327 CC
genotype and CAD (p = 0.0218). Among the 104 CAD patients, the CC
genotype was also associated with shorter telomere length (p = 0.0287).
Matsubara et al. (2006) suggested that the -1327 CC genotype is a risk
factor for CAD and that it relates to shorter telomere length among CAD
patients.

identified heterozygosity for a G-to-C transversion in exon 11 of the
TERT gene, resulting in a lys902-to-asn (K902N) substitution in a highly

the K902N mutant protein had almost no telomerase activity, resulting in
haploinsufficiency.

In a 58-year-old man with telomere-related pulmonary fibrosis-1 (614742)
from a 4-generation Caucasian family with interstitial lung disease,
Tsakiri et al. (2007) identified a heterozygous 2594G-A transition in
the TERT gene, resulting in an arg865-to-his (R865H) substitution in the
consensus sequence of motif C, which is conserved in all reverse
transcriptase proteins. The mutant protein had about 30% residual
activity and affected individuals had shorter telomeres compared to
family members without the mutation. Three mutation carriers had anemia,
4 had osteoporosis or osteopenia, 2 had cancer, and 1 had cirrhosis, but
2 mutation carriers did not have lung disease.

In a 67-year-old man with telomere-related pulmonary fibrosis-1 (614742)
from a 4-generation Caucasian family with interstitial lung disease,
Tsakiri et al. (2007) identified a heterozygous 1-bp deletion (2240delT)
in the TERT gene, creating a frameshift predicted to result in a
truncated protein missing half of the reverse-transcriptase domain and
the entire C terminus (V747fsX766). The mutant protein had essentially
no enzymatic activity. There were 5 members of the next generation who
inherited the mutation but had no evidence of pulmonary disease, but all
carriers of the mutation had shorter telomeres than age-matched family
members without the mutation. One mutation carrier had anemia, 2 had
osteopenia or osteoporosis, and 1 had lymphoma.

In a male nonsmoker with telomere-related pulmonary fibrosis-1 (614742)
who was diagnosed at 58 years of age and died at age 67 years, Armanios
et al. (2007) identified heterozygosity for a +1G-A transition in intron
1 of the TERT gene, located at a consensus sequence conserved in 99.9%
of all eukaryotic genes and predicted to alter splicing. The mutation
was also found in his 2 affected sibs and in his as-yet unaffected
daughter and niece; the mutation was not found in 623 controls. Telomere
length in the lymphocytes of the unaffected niece was less than 1% of
controls. None of the mutation carriers had skin manifestations or
evidence of bone marrow involvement.

In affected members of an Iraqi Jewish family with autosomal dominant
dyskeratosis congenita-2 (613989), Basel-Vanagaite et al. (2008)
identified a heterozygous 1892G-A transition in the TERT gene, resulting
in an arg631-to-gln (R631Q) substitution in a conserved residue in motif
2 of the RT domain. Affected males presented with thrombocytopenia, and
later developed aplastic anemia, premature graying of the hair, and
pulmonary and hepatic fibrosis. One patient developed cardiac fibrosis
and another developed dilated cardiomyopathy. Anticipation for these
features was observed. While all 6 males of the family were severely
affected, 2 female mutation carriers had only premature gray hair;
however, all mutation carriers had a similar shortening of telomere
length.

In a 13-year-old Libyan girl, born of consanguineous parents, with
autosomal recessive dyskeratosis congenita-4 (DKCB4; see 613989),
Marrone et al. (2007) identified a homozygous 2431C-T transition in exon
8 of the TERT gene, resulting in an arg811-to-cys (R811C) substitution
in the nonconserved region of the RT domain. In vitro functional
expression assays showed that the mutant protein had less than 50%
residual activity, and there was no evidence of a dominant-negative
effect. The patient had poor growth, bone marrow failure, reticulated
pigmentation of the skin, leukoplakia, and nail dysplasia. Her parents,
who were each heterozygous for the mutation, had mild manifestations,
such as dysplastic toenails and hyperpigmented skin.

TERT, ARG901TRP

In a 3-year-old girl, born of consanguineous Iranian-Jewish parents,
with autosomal recessive dyskeratosis congenita-4 (see 613989), Marrone
et al. (2007) identified a homozygous 2701C-T transition in exon 11 of
the TERT gene, resulting in an arg901-to-trp (R901W) substitution in a
conserved D motif of the RT domain. In vitro functional expression
assays showed that the mutant protein had less than 25% residual
activity, and there was no evidence of a dominant-negative effect. The
parents were heterozygous for the mutation, confirming autosomal
recessive inheritance. The patient had early bone marrow failure,
leukoplakia, failure to thrive, cerebellar hypoplasia, microcephaly, and
developmental delay. Telomere lengths were severely shortened in the
patient and at the low-normal level in both parents. Marrone et al.
(2007) noted that the presence of developmental delay and cerebellar
hypoplasia was consistent with a clinical diagnosis of
Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson syndrome, which is a severe variant of DKC.

In a 31-year-old Scottish man with autosomal recessive dyskeratosis

2110C-T transition in exon 5 of the TERT gene, resulting in a
pro704-to-ser (P704S) substitution. Functional analysis showed that the
mutant protein had 13% residual activity. The patient had short stature,
elfin appearance, esophageal stricture, leukoplakia of the buccal
mucosa, anus, and penis, abnormal pigmentation, hyperkeratosis of his
palms, ridged fingernails, avascular necrosis of both hips, tooth loss,
chronic diarrhea, learning difficulties, pulmonary infiltrates, and
progressive bone marrow failure. The mother, who healthy, was
heterozygous for the P704S mutation. The father, who had osteoporosis at
age 61, was compound heterozygous for P704S and another mutation (H412Y;
187270.0002). However, he had normal peripheral blood counts.
Coexpression of the 2 TERT mutations in the father resulted in an
intermediate telomerase activity of 22%. Both the proband and his father
had very short telomeres.

In a man with onset of telomere-related pulmonary fibrosis-1 (614742) at
age 77 years, Armanios et al. (2007) identified a heterozygous T-to-A
transversion in the TERT gene, resulting in a leu55-to-gln (L55Q)
substitution. A brother had died of the disease, but no DNA was
available for study. Two of the proband's asymptomatic children also
carried the mutation. Telomere length in 2 mutation carriers was less
than 10% of control values. None of the mutation carriers had skin
manifestations or evidence of bone marrow involvement.

PULMONARY FIBROSIS, TELOMERE-RELATED, 1
TERT, IVS9AS, A-C, -2

In a woman with onset of telomere-related pulmonary fibrosis-1 (614742)
at age 48 years, Armanios et al. (2007) identified a heterozygous A-to-C
transversion in intron 9 of the TERT gene (IVS9-2A-C). Her unaffected
brother also carried the mutation; telomere length in his lymphocytes
was less than 10% of control values. The proband did not have skin
manifestations or evidence of bone marrow involvement.

.0017
PULMONARY FIBROSIS, TELOMERE-RELATED, 1
TERT, VAL791ILE AND VAL867MET

In affected members of 2 unrelated families with telomere-related
pulmonary fibrosis-1 (614742), Alder et al. (2011) identified
heterozygosity for an allele carrying 2 mutations in cis in the TERT
gene: a 2371G-A transition in exon 7 and a 2599G-A transition in exon
10, resulting in a val791-to-ile (V791I) and a val867-to-met (V867M)
substitution, respectively. The mutations were not found in 200
controls. In 1 family, the mutant allele segregated with the phenotype
across 3 generations. Haplotype analysis and family histories of the 2
families indicated a founder effect. A common ancestor had emigrated
from the British Isles to the United States in the 18th century. In
vitro functional expression studies showed that the double mutant showed
severe defects in telomere repeat addition processivity, with the V867M
mutation causing most, if not all, of the functional defects. All
mutation carriers had telomere lengths below the 10th percentile, and 6
of 9 mutation carriers had lengths below the 1st percentile. Most
mutation carriers had adult-onset pulmonary fibrosis, 2 had liver
abnormalities, 1 had cytopenia, and 1 developed acute myeloid leukemia.
None had abnormal skin findings.

.0018
PULMONARY FIBROSIS AND/OR BONE MARROW FAILURE, TELOMERE-RELATED, 1
TERT, VAL170MET

In affected members of 2 unrelated families with telomere-related
pulmonary fibrosis and/or bone marrow failure-1 (614742), Parry et al.
(2011) identified a heterozygous mutation in the TERT gene, resulting in
a val170-to-met (V170M) substitution. One mutation carrier had liver
disease. The V170M mutation was demonstrated to cause decreased
telomerase activity (about 65% of control activity).

.0019
PULMONARY FIBROSIS AND/OR BONE MARROW FAILURE, TELOMERE-RELATED, 1
TERT, ALA716THR

In affected members of a family with telomere-related pulmonary fibrosis
and/or bone marrow failure-1 (614742), Parry et al. (2011) identified a
heterozygous mutation in the TERT gene, resulting in an ala726-to-thr
(A716T) substitution. The A726T mutation was demonstrated to cause
severely compromised telomerase activity (close to 0%).

.0020
PULMONARY FIBROSIS AND/OR BONE MARROW FAILURE, TELOMERE-RELATED, 1
TERT, LYS902ARG

In affected members of a family with telomere-related pulmonary fibrosis
and/or bone marrow failure-1 (614742), Parry et al. (2011) identified a
heterozygous mutation in the TERT gene, resulting in a lys902-to-arg
(K902R) substitution. Two mutation carriers had liver disease.

.0021
PULMONARY FIBROSIS AND/OR BONE MARROW FAILURE, TELOMERE-RELATED, 1
TERT, PRO923LEU

In a 56-year-old man with telomere-related pulmonary fibrosis and bone
marrow failure-1 (614742), Gansner et al. (2012) identified a
heterozygous 2768C-T transition in the TERT gene, resulting in a
pro923-to-leu (P923L) substitution in a conserved residue in the
putative oligomerization domain. The patient had a family history of a
similar disorder: his father and 1 sister had pulmonary fibrosis, a
second sister had pulmonary fibrosis and thrombocytopenia, and a third
sister had pulmonary fibrosis and acute myeloid leukemia. Telomere
lengths in the proband were less than 1% of control values.

.0022
LEUKEMIA, ACUTE MYELOID, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
TERT, ALA1062THR

Calado et al. (2009) found a significant association between the
presence of a germline ala1062-to-thr (A1062T) mutation in the TERT gene
in patients with sporadic acute myeloid leukemia (AML; 601626) compared
to controls. A1062T was 3-fold higher among 594 patients compared to
1,110 controls (p = 0.0009). In vitro studies showed that the mutation
caused haploinsufficiency of telomerase activity. A high proportion of
mutation carriers had an abnormal karyotype. Calado et al. (2009)
suggested that telomere attrition may promote genomic instability and
DNA damage, which may contribute to the development of leukemia.

.0023
MELANOMA, CUTANEOUS MALIGNANT, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, 9
TERT, -57, T-G

In affected members of a 4-generation family prone to malignant melanoma
(CMM9; 615134), Horn et al. (2013) identified a T-to-G transversion at
the -57 position of the TERT promoter. Affected individuals developed
melanoma at a young age and 2 individuals had additional forms of
cancer. This mutation was not found among 140 sporadic melanoma cases,
165 healthy controls, index cases from 34 Spanish melanoma families, or
in dbSNP or the 1000 Genomes databases.

614088	TITLE *614088 INTRACELLULAR ADHESION MOLECULE 4; ICAM4
;;CD242 ANTIGEN; CD242;;
LW GENE; LW
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Intracellular adhesion molecule-4 (ICAM4) is a member of the
immunoglobulin (Ig) gene superfamily and encodes the Landsteiner-Wiener
(LW) blood group antigens (111250) (Bailly et al., 1994; Bailly et al.,
1995).

CLONING

Bailly et al. (1994) cloned ICAM4 cDNAs from a human bone marrow cDNA
library. One form encodes a single-spanning transmembrane protein of 270
amino acids, including a 29-amino acid signal peptide. A second form
encodes a shortened protein of 236 residues without transmembrane and
cytoplasm domains. The predicted protein shares approximately 30%
identity with intercellular adhesion molecules ICAM1 (147840), ICAM2
(146630), and ICAM3 (146631), which are the counterreceptors for the
lymphocyte function-associated antigen LFA1 (see 153370 and 600065). The
extracellular domain of ICAM4 consists, like that of ICAM2, of 2 Ig-like
domains, and the critical residues involved in binding of LFA1 to ICAMs
are partially conserved in ICAM4.

Using RT-PCR, Hermand et al. (1995) cloned ICAM4 from whole blood RNA.
The sequence was identical to that of the full-length cDNA reported by
Bailly et al. (1994) except for differences in the region encoding the
signal sequence. The corrected ICAM4 sequence reported by Hermand et al.
(1995) encodes a 271-amino acid protein with a 30-amino acid signal
peptide.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hermand et al. (1996) characterized the ICAM4 gene, which contains 3
exons spanning approximately 2.65 kb.

MAPPING

ICAM4 maps to chromosome 19p13.2, based on the previous mapping of the
LW locus to this location (Hermand et al., 1995).

GENE FUNCTION

Bailly et al. (1995) purified the ICAM4 (LW) protein from red cells and
found that the protein bound to the leukocyte CD11a/CD18 and CD11b/CD18
integrins (see 600065). They speculated that ICAM4 may be involved in
regulation of red cell turnover.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- LW Blood Group System: LW(a)/LW(b) Polymorphism

Hermand et al. (1995) determined that the LW(a)/LW(b) polymorphism of
the LW blood group system (111250) is determined by a single-basepair
substitution in the ICAM4 gene (614088.0001).

- LW Blood Group System: LW(a-b-) Phenotype

Using Southern blot analysis, Hermand et al. (1995) showed that the
ICAM4 gene was not grossly rearranged in an individual with the LW(a-b-)
phenotype of the LW blood group system (111250) or in individuals with
the Rh-null phenotype, who also lack LW antigens. RFLP analysis using
PvuII indicated that the LW(a-b-) individual and 3 Rh-null individuals
were homozygous for a phenotypically silent LW(a) allele.

In an individual with the LW(a-b-) phenotype who carried a normal Rh
phenotype, Hermand et al. (1996) found a 10-bp deletion in the ICAM4
gene (614088.0002) that generated a premature stop codon and encoded a
truncated protein without the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains.
Heterogeneity was indicated by the fact that no detectable abnormality
of the LW gene or transcript could be detected in another LW(a-b-)
individual.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
LW BLOOD GROUP SYSTEM, LW(a)/LW(b) POLYMORPHISM
ICAM4, GLN100ARG

Hermand et al. (1995) demonstrated that the molecular basis for the
LW(a)/LW(b) polymorphism of the LW blood group system (111250) is an
A-to-G change at nucleotide 299 (relative to the translation initiation
site) of the ICAM4 gene that correlates with a PvuII restriction site
and results in a gln100-to-arg (Q100R) amino acid substitution. COS-7
cells transfected with LW(a) or LW(b) cDNAs reacted with human
anti-LW(a) and anti-LW(b) sera, respectively, as well as with a murine
monoclonal anti-LW(ab) antibody, as shown by flow cytometry analysis.
Hermand et al. (1995) referred to this polymorphism as an A-to-G change
at nucleotide 308 (relative to the transcription initiation site),
resulting in a GLN70ARG (Q70R) substitution (numbering using the mature
ICAM4 protein sequence, after removal of the signal peptide).

.0002
LW BLOOD GROUP SYSTEM, LW(a-b-) PHENOTYPE
ICAM4, 10-BP DEL, NT346

In an individual with the rare LW(a-b-) phenotype of the LW blood group
system (111250) who carried a normal Rh phenotype, Hermand et al. (1996)
identified a 10-bp deletion (ACCTGCGCAG) at nucleotide 346 (relative to
the translation initiation site) in exon 1 of the ICAM4 gene. The
deletion generated a premature stop codon, resulting in a truncated
protein without the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. Heterogeneity
was indicated by the fact that no detectable abnormality of the ICAM4
gene or transcript could be detected in another LW(a-b-) individual.
Hermand et al. (1996) referred to this mutation as a 10-bp deletion at
nucleotide 355 (relative to the transcription initiation site).

142370	TITLE *142370 HEMOPOIETIC CELL KINASE; HCK
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

HCK is an SRC (190090) family tyrosine kinase that is expressed
predominantly in granulocytic and monocytic cells. It has proposed
functional roles in phagocytosis and receptor-mediated signaling
(summary by Scott et al., 2002).

CLONING

During a search for a cDNA clone representing human SRC (190090),
Quintrell et al. (1987) encountered a previously unrecognized gene that
appeared to encode a protein-tyrosine kinase similar to SRC. Ziegler et
al. (1987) found the same gene by a different route. Expression of this
gene may be limited to certain hemopoietic cells and is especially
prominent in cells of myeloid lineage, particularly mature granulocytes
and monocytes. Therefore, Quintrell et al. (1987) designated the gene
HCK (pronounced 'hick') for hemopoietic cell kinase. They described the
nucleotide sequence of a cDNA clone representing most or all of the mRNA
for HCK, the deduced amino acid sequence of the protein encoded by HCK,
and the distribution of RNA transcribed from HCK among various
hemopoietic cells. The deduced HCK protein contains 505 amino acids and
has a calculated molecular mass of about 57 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

Using mass spectrometric analysis, Scott et al. (2002) identified 25
potential binding partners in a human monocyte cell line for the SH3
domain of HCK. Analysis with purified proteins and in intact cells
confirmed the interactions with WIP (WIPF1; 602357), WASP (WAS; 300392),
and ELMO1 (606420). ELMO1 was heavily tyrosine phosphorylated in cells
coexpressing HCK and ELMO1, suggesting that ELMO1 is a HCK substrate.
Pull-down analysis showed that binding of ELMO1 to the HCK SH3 domain
could be inhibited by polyproline peptides, indicating that an ELMO1
polyproline motif interacts with HCK. Scott et al. (2002) concluded that
WIP, WASP, and ELMO1 may be activators or effectors of HCK.

MAPPING

By spot-blot analysis of sorted chromosomes and by in situ
hybridization, Quintrell et al. (1987) assigned the HCK gene to
chromosome 20q11-q12. Since this region is affected by interstitial
deletions in some acute myeloid leukemias and myeloproliferative
disorders, they suggested that damage to HCK may contribute to the
pathogenesis of these conditions.

300081	TITLE *300081 DEOXYRIBONUCLEASE I-LIKE 1; DNASE1L1
;;DNase I, LYSOSOMAL-LIKE; DNL1L;;
DNase I-LIKE, MUSCLE-SPECIFIC
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Parrish et al. (1995) isolated a novel cDNA from the region of Xq28
between QM (312173) and DXS1010E. Translation of the long open reading
frame found in the cDNA yielded a putative 302-amino acid protein with
37.6% identity to human DNase I (125505). The protein was predicted to
contain a signal sequence at the amino terminus, a transmembrane domain
near the carboxyl terminus, and a helix-loop-helix domain. The
transcript was present at highest levels in skeletal and cardiac muscle,
with lower expression in other tissues.

Pergolizzi et al. (1996) screened cDNA libraries with a cosmid that had
been mapped to Xq28 in the region between RCP/GCP (300822; 300821) and
G6PD (305900). They obtained a 2.1-kb cDNA and showed that it encodes a
putative 302-amino acid protein with 44% sequence identity to pig DNase
I and 39% identity to human DNase I. Northern blot analysis detected a
single 2.0-kb transcript in adult heart and skeletal muscle and an
additional transcript of 2.5 kb in some fetal tissues. The sequence of
Pergolizzi et al. (1996) was identical to that reported by Parrish et
al. (1995).

MAPPING

The DNASE1L1 gene maps to chromosome Xq28 (Parrish et al., 1995).
