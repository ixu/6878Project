DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SFRS12 belongs to the superfamily of serine/arginine-rich (SR) splicing
factors. It modulates splice site selection by regulating the activities
of other SR proteins (Barnard et al., 2002).

CLONING

Barnard and Patton (2000) cloned rat Sfrs12, which they called Srrp86.
The deduced 495-amino acid protein contains an RNA recognition motif
(RRM) near its N terminus and 2 SR domains separated by a unique EK
(glutamic acid and lysine)-rich region.

By PCR of a human pancreas cDNA library, Zhang et al. (2002) cloned
SFRS12, which they called SRRp508. The deduced 508-amino acid protein
contains an N-terminal RRM and 2 C-terminal regions rich in SR
dipeptides. The rat and human SFRS12 proteins share 86% identity. Zhang
et al. (2002) determined that SFRS12 has an extensive expression
profile.

GENE FUNCTION

Barnard and Patton (2000) found that immunodepletion of SRRp86 did not
affect the ability of HeLa cell nuclear extracts to splice an RNA test
substrate. However, SRRp86 could modulate the ability of purified
mammalian SR proteins to activate splicing in vitro and in vivo.
Mammalian SRp20 (SFRS3; 603364) was activated by SRRp86, whereas ASF
(SFRS1; 600812), SC35 (SFRS2; 600813), and SRp55 (SFRS6; 601944) were
inhibited. Full-length mammalian SRRp86, but not a mutant lacking the 2
RS domains and the intervening EK-rich region, preferentially interacted
with itself, SRp20, ASF, SRp55, and, to a lesser extent, SC35. Barnard
and Patton (2000) concluded that the pairwise combination of SRRp86 and
specific SR proteins leads to altered splicing efficiency and
differential splice site selection.

By Western blot analysis of several rat tissues, Barnard et al. (2002)
found that the ratio of Srrp86, Srp20, and Sc35 was tissue specific.
They hypothesized that the altered ratio of SR proteins could allow for
fine-tuned control of tissue-specific alternative splicing by varying
the levels of activators and repressors of splice site selection.

Li et al. (2002) generated a series of chimeric proteins by swapping the
RRM and SR domains between mammalian SRRp86, ASF, and SRp75 (SFRS4;
601940). Although domain swaps between SRRp86 and ASF showed that the
RRMs primarily determined splicing activity, swaps between SRRp86 and
SRp75 demonstrated that the SR domains could also determine activity.
The EK domain of SRRp86 repressed splicing and splice site selection
both in vitro and in vivo. Li et al. (2002) concluded that the EK domain
of SRRp86 plays a modulatory role in controlling SR domain function.

GENE STRUCTURE

Zhang et al. (2002) determined that the SFRS12 gene contains 12 exons.
The promoter region contains a TATA box.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Zhang et al. (2002) mapped the SFRS12 gene
to chromosome 5q11.2-q12.1.

607103	TITLE *607103 ARGINYLTRANSFERASE 1; ATE1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The N-end rule relates the in vivo half-life of a protein to the
identity of its N-terminal residue. N-terminal arginine is a primary
destabilizing residue for ubiquitin-dependent degradation, while
N-terminal aspartate and glutamate are secondary destabilizing residues
due to their role as substrates for arginylation by ATE1.

CLONING

Based on sequence similarity to mouse Ate1, Kwon et al. (1999)
identified human ATE1 within an EST clone and subsequently cloned 2
forms of ATE1 cDNA from human embryonic kidney cells. They determined
that the 2 variants of ATE1, which they termed ATE1-1 and ATE1-2, are
found in both human and mouse and result from the use of alternate
second exons. In mouse, both variants encode deduced 516-amino acid
proteins with calculated molecular masses of about 59 kD. The 43-residue
sequences encoded by the alternate exons are 31% identical. Northern
blot analysis of mouse tissues revealed a 5-kb transcript in all tissues
tested except testis, where the major transcript was 2 kb. Restriction
digests of the transcripts suggested that the ratio of Ate1-1 to Ate1-2
varies between tissues. Transfection of fluorescence-tagged Ate1-1 into
mouse fibroblasts resulted in both nuclear and cytosolic localization,
whereas Ate1-2 localization was exclusively cytosolic.

ANIMAL MODEL

Kwon et al. (2002) generated mice lacking ATE1. Ate1 -/- embryos died
with defects in heart development and in angiogenic remodeling of the
early vascular plexus. Through biochemical analyses, Kwon et al. (2002)
demonstrated that the N-terminal cysteine, in contrast to N-terminal
aspartate and glutamate, is oxidized before its arginylation by
R-transferase, suggesting that the arginylation branch of the N-end rule
pathway functions as an oxygen sensor. Ate1 +/- mice were apparently
normal, but Ate1 knockout embryos were pale and had thinner blood
vessels and frequent skin edema in embryonic days 9.5 to 12.5.
Hemorrhages were a consistent feature of homozygous mutant embryos and
were the likely proximal cause of death. Of 22 Ate1 -/- hearts examined
at embryonic days 13.5 to 15.5, about 85% had an atrial septal defect.
The atria were thin-walled with sparse trabeculae and a large atrial
septal defect. About 90% of examined Ate1-knockout embryonic hearts
exhibited hypoplasia of both the right and left ventricular myocardium.
The compact zone of the left ventricular myocardium was 2 or 3 cells
thick, in contrast to 7 to 10 cells in wildtype embryos. About 70% of
knockout Ate1 knockout mice had persistent truncus arteriosus, with the
common root of the aorta and pulmonary artery straddling a large ventral
septal defect. Vasculogenesis was normal at embryonic day 9.5, but
angiogenic remodeling was suppressed. Kwon et al. (2002) identified a
physiologic function for the posttranslational conjugation of arginine
to N-termini of proteins, a reaction first described by Kaji et al.
(1963). Kwon et al. (2002) also showed that the N-terminal cysteine
undergoes 2 covalent modifications, oxidation and arginylation, by the
N-end rule pathway. Methionine-aminopeptidases cleave off the N-terminal
methionine of the newly formed protein if a second residue is small
enough. Among the arginylatable residues, only cysteine satisfies this
condition.

In immunoprecipitation studies of embryonic fibroblasts from wildtype
and knockout mice deficient in the arginylation enzyme Ate1, Karakozova
et al. (2006) found that approximately 40% of intracellular beta-actin
(102630) is arginylated in vivo. In both wildtype and Ate1-null cells
beta-actin was stable, suggesting that arginylation does not induce
beta-actin degradation. Karakozova et al. (2006) found that arginylation
of beta-actin regulates cell motility. The majority of Ate1-null cells
appeared smaller than wildtype cells and were apparently unable to form
lamellae during movement along the substrate. Ate-null cells failed to
form normal lamellae during motility, resulting in their inability to
cover the same distance or occupy the same area of th substrate as the
control cells. In addition, Ate1-null cells exhibited apparent defects
in ruffling activity and cortical flow. Karakozova et al. (2006)
concluded that arginylation of beta-actin apparently represents a
critical step in the actin N-terminal processing needed for actin
functioning in vivo.

GENE FUNCTION

By stabilization assays and N-terminal sequencing of beta-galactosidase
substrate proteins, Kwon et al. (1999) found that both mouse Ate1-1 and
Ate1-2 conferred instability on asp-beta-galactosidase through
arginylation of the N-terminal asp. Cys-beta-galactosidase was a
less-efficient substrate.

The conjugation of arginine to proteins is a part of the N-end rule
pathway of protein degradation. Three N-terminal residues--aspartate,
glutamate, and cysteine--are arginylated by ATE1-encoded
arginyl-transferases. Hu et al. (2005) reported that oxidation of
N-terminal cysteine is essential for its arginylation. They showed that
the in vivo oxidation of N-terminal cysteine, before its arginylation,
requires nitric oxide, and reconstituted this process in vitro as well.
The levels of regulatory proteins bearing N-terminal cysteine, such as
RGS4 (602516), RGS5 (603276), and RGS16 (602514), were greatly increased
in mouse Ate1-null embryos, which lack arginylation. Stabilization of
these proteins, the first physiologic substrates of mammalian N-end rule
pathway, may underlie cardiovascular defects in Ate1-null embryos. Hu et
al. (2005) concluded that their findings identify the N-end rule pathway
as a new nitric oxide sensor that functions through its ability to
destroy specific regulatory proteins bearing N-terminal cysteine, at
rates controlled by nitric oxide and apparently by oxygen as well.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kwon et al. (1999) determined that the mouse Ate1 gene contains 3 exons.
Two alternate 129-bp regions, which are separated by 0.8 kb, are used as
exon 2.

614454	TITLE *614454 UBIQUITIN PROTEIN LIGASE E3C; UBE3C
;;HECTH2;;
KIAA0010;;
KIAA10
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Ubiquitin (UBB; 191339) modification of lysine residues targets proteins
for degradation via the proteasome (see 606223). Ubiquitination requires
a ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1; see 314370), a ubiquitin-carrier
protein (E2; see 602961), and a ubiquitin-protein ligase (E3), such as
UBE3C. E3 enzymes transiently accept ubiquitin from the E2 in a thiol
ester linkage prior to transferring ubiquitin to the target lysine
(summary by You and Pickart, 2001).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated human immature
myeloid cell line KG-1, Nomura et al. (1994) obtained a partial UBE3C
clone, which they designated KIAA0010. The deduced protein shares
significant similarity with E6AP (UBE3A; 601623), and it contains a
lipid attachment site and a tyrosine kinase phosphorylation site.
Northern blot analysis detected KIAA0010 expression in all tissues and
cell lines examined, with highest expression in lung, liver, skeletal
muscle, kidney, spleen, testis, and ovary, and weakest expression in
thymus.

You and Pickart (2001) cloned full-length UBE3C, which they called
KIAA10. The deduced 1,083-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular
mass of about 120 kD. KIAA10 has a unique N-terminal domain predicted to
mediate substrate binding and a C-terminal HECT domain, suggesting that
it functions as a HECT domain family E3 ligase.

GENE FUNCTION

Schwarz et al. (1998) showed that in vitro-translated human UBE3C, which
they called HECTH2, formed a thioester complex with ubiquitin in the
presence of an E1 enzyme and the E2 enzyme UBCH5 (UBE2D1; 602961), with
reduced efficiency with the E2 UBCH7 (UBE2L3; 603721).

You and Pickart (2001) showed that full-length KIAA10 and its isolated
428-amino acid C terminus, including the HECT domain, assembled
polyubiquitin chains linked through lys29 or lys48. KIAA10 also
displayed autoubiquitination. The N-terminal KIAA10 domain was devoid of
activity. Mutation analysis revealed that the N terminus of KIAA10
interacted directly with the S2 subunit of the proteasome 26S complex
(PSMD2; 606223).

MAPPING

By PCR of a human-rodent hybrid cell line panel, Nomura et al. (1994)
mapped the UBE3C gene to chromosome 7.

Hartz (2012) mapped the UBE3C gene to chromosome 7q36.3 based on an
alignment of the UBE3C sequence (GenBank GENBANK D13635) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

600418	TITLE *600418 AMPHIPHYSIN; AMPH
;;AMPHIPHYSIN I
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Lichte et al. (1992) isolated a novel synaptic vesicle-associated
protein, amphiphysin, by screening a chicken brain lambda-gt11 library
with antibodies raised against chicken brain synaptic proteins. An
acidic protein present also in mammalian nervous tissue, amphiphysin,
was shown by immunocytochemistry to be concentrated in nerve terminals.
See also amphiphysin-like (AMPHL; 601248).

GENE FUNCTION

David et al. (1994) found that the N- and C-terminal domains of the
amphiphysin protein are highly conserved between chicken and human.
Autoantibodies from patients with the stiff-man syndrome show a dominant
autoepitope located in the C-terminal region, which contains an SH3
domain.

Yamamoto et al. (1995) noted that the tissue distribution of AMPH and
its association with neurotransmitter vesicles make the gene a candidate
for involvement in such diverse heritable disorders as those of the
nervous system, certain endocrine tissues (such as the adrenal medulla,
pituitary gland or endocrine pancreas), or male fertility.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Pathogenic Role of Anti-Amphiphysin Antibodies

Stiff-man syndrome (184850) is a rare disease of the central nervous
system characterized by progressive rigidity of the body musculature
with superimposed painful spasms. An autoimmune origin of the disease
has been proposed. Approximately 60% of patients are positive for
autoantibodies directed against the GABA-synthesizing enzyme glutamic
acid decarboxylase (GAD; 605363). A few patients, all women affected by
breast cancer, were found to be negative for GAD autoantibodies but
positive for autoantibodies directed against a 128-kD synaptic protein.
De Camilli et al. (1993) found that this antigen is amphiphysin. Both
GAD and amphiphysin are nonintrinsic membrane proteins that are
concentrated in nerve terminals, where a pool of the 2 proteins is
associated with the cytoplasmic surface of synaptic vesicles.

Wessig et al. (2003) reported a 71-year-old woman with invasive ductal
carcinoma and a paraneoplastic stiff-person syndrome characterized by
stiffness in the right arm, stiff and unsteady gait, and increased
sweating. Anti-amphiphysin antibodies were detected in the patient's
serum and CSF, and the patient temporarily responded to plasmapheresis.
Postmortem studies detected antibodies in the central nervous system
parenchyma, suggesting a pathogenic role.

- Crystal Structure

Peter et al. (2004) solved the structure of the Drosophila amphiphysin
BAR domain. It is a crescent-shaped dimer that binds preferentially to
highly curved negatively charged membranes. With its amino-terminal
amphipathic helix and BAR domain, amphiphysin can drive membrane
curvature in vitro and in vivo. The structure is similar to that of
arfaptin-2 (601638), which Peter et al. (2004) found also binds and
tubulates membranes. From this, Peter et al. (2004) predicted that BAR
domains are in many protein families, including sorting nexins,
centaurins, and oligophrenins. The universal and minimal BAR domain is a
dimerization, membrane-binding, and curvature-sensing module.

MAPPING

By PCR analysis of hybrid cell DNAs and by fluorescence in situ
hybridization, Yamamoto et al. (1995) mapped the AMPH gene to 7p14-p13.
The homologous locus Amph was mapped to the proximal region of mouse
chromosome 13 by Jenkins et al. (1995).

Yamamoto et al. (1995) excluded AMPH as a candidate gene for either RP9
(180104) or dominant cystoid macular dystrophy (MDDC; 153880) by showing
that AMPH maps to a different segment of the genetic map of chromosome
7, defined by microsatellite markers, than does either of the eye
disorders.

ANIMAL MODEL

Di Paolo et al. (2002) generated Amph knockout mice and found that lack
of Amph caused a parallel loss of amphiphysin-2 (601248) selectively in
brain. Cell-free assembly of endocytic protein scaffolds was defective
in mutant brain extracts and there were defects in synaptic vesicle
recycling. These defects correlated with major learning deficits and
with increased mortality due to rare irreversible seizures, suggesting
that Amph has a critical role in higher brain functions.

601398	TITLE *601398 VASCULAR ENDOTHELIAL GROWTH FACTOR B; VEGFB
;;VASCULAR ENDOTHELIAL GROWTH FACTOR-RELATED FACTOR; VRF
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Vascular endothelial growth factor B (VEGFB) signals via the endothelial
receptor VEGFR1 (165070) and is a regulator of blood vessel physiology,
with a role in endothelial targeting of lipids to peripheral tissues
(summary by Hagberg et al., 2010).

CLONING

Grimmond et al. (1996) cloned and characterized a member of the vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF; 192240) gene family, which they
designated VRF for VEGF-related factor. By sequencing of cDNAs from a
human fetal brain library and RT-PCR products from normal and tumor
tissue cDNA pools, they identified 2 alternatively spliced messages with
open reading frames of 621 and 564 bp, respectively. The predicted 186-
and 167-amino acid polypeptides differ at their carboxyl ends, resulting
from a shift in the open reading frame. Both isoforms show strong
homology to VEGF at their amino termini, but only the shorter isoform
maintained homology to VEGF at its carboxyl terminus and conserved all
16 cysteine residues of the 165-amino acid form of VEGF. VRF was
predicted to contain a signal peptide, suggesting to Grimmond et al.
(1996) that it may be a secreted factor. The investigators found that
VRF is ubiquitously expressed as 2 transcripts of 2.0 and 5.5 kb and
that the level of expression is similar among normal and malignant
tissues.

Olofsson et al. (1996) showed that mouse and human VEGFB-167 share 88%
sequence identity. By Northern blot analysis of human tissues, they
identified a 1.4-kb VEGFB-167 transcript expressed in heart, skeletal
muscle, pancreas, and prostate.

Olofsson et al. (1996) showed that the C termini of VEGFB-167, VEGF, and
other related growth factors contain a strongly basic cysteine-rich
heparin binding domain, whereas the C terminus of VEGFB-186 has no
heparin binding domain, is less basic and more hydrophobic, and has no
similarity to any published sequence. Olofsson et al. (1996) performed
Northern blot analysis using a probe specific to VEGFB-186 and found a
1.4-kb transcript expressed in a pattern nearly identical to that
described by Olofsson et al. (1996) for VEGFB-167.

GENE STRUCTURE

Grimmond et al. (1996) found that the protein coding region of VRF,
which spans approximately 5 kb, is composed of 8 exons that range in
size from 36 to 431 bp. Exons 6 and 7 are contiguous and the 2 isoforms
of VRF arise through alternate splicing of exon 6.

GENE FUNCTION

In a large panel of tumors of endocrine and nonendocrine origin,
Grimmond et al. (1996) observed a reduction in expression of VRF only in
those endocrine tumors known to be hemizygous for 11q. The authors
pointed out that the putative role of VRF as a growth factor makes it an
unlikely candidate for the MEN1 tumor suppressor gene.

Olofsson et al. (1996) noted that VEGF and VEGFB-167 are coexpressed in
many tissues. In situ hybridization revealed that VEGFB-167 is expressed
predominantly in muscular tissues and that expression can be detected at
an early stage during embryonic development. Expression of VEGF and
VEGFB-167 in transfected human embryonic 293EBNA cells and subsequent
analysis by SDS/PAGE showed that VEGFB-167 forms cell-associated
disulfide-linked dimers and can form heterodimers with VEGF. Olofsson et
al. (1996) demonstrated that VEGFB-167 can act as an endothelial cell
growth factor.

Olofsson et al. (1996) reported the expression of VEGF and VEGFB-186 in
transfected human embryonic 293EBNA cells; subsequent analysis by
SDS/PAGE revealed that VEGFB-186 is secreted as a disulfide-linked
homodimer and that, like VEGFB-167, this isoform can form
disulfide-linked heterodimers with VEGF. Expression experiments using
COS cells and digestion with neuraminidase also revealed that VEGFB-186
undergoes O-linked glycosylation during its intracellular transport and
secretion.

Silvestre et al. (2003) analyzed the angiogenic effect of VEGFB in 2
different models of angiogenesis: an in vivo model of Matrigel and a
mouse model of surgically induced hindlimb ischemia. They demonstrated
that VEGFB, in part through its receptor VEGFR1 (165070), promotes
angiogenesis in association with activation of AKT (164730) and
endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS; 163729)-related pathways.

Hagberg et al. (2010) showed that VEGFB has a role in endothelial
targeting of lipids to peripheral tissues. Dietary lipids present in
circulation must be transported through the vascular endothelium to be
metabolized by tissue cells. Bioinformatic analysis showed that Vegfb
was tightly coexpressed with nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes across
a large variety of physiologic conditions in mice, pointing to a role
for VEGFB in metabolism. VEGFB specifically controlled endothelial
uptake of fatty acids via transcriptional regulation of vascular fatty
acid transport proteins. As a consequence, Vegfb -/- mice showed less
uptake and accumulation of lipids in muscle, heart, and brown adipose
tissue, and instead shunted lipids to white adipose tissue. This
regulation was mediated by VEGFR1 and neuropilin-1 (NRP1; 602069)
expressed by the endothelium. The coexpression of VEGFB and
mitochondrial proteins introduces a novel regulatory mechanism, whereby
endothelial lipid uptake and mitochondrial lipid use are tightly
coordinated.

MAPPING

Grimmond et al. (1996) showed that the VRF gene is located within a
cosmid (the D11S750 locus) which maps to 11q13 in the region of multiple
endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1; 131100). PCR-based mapping against a
human/hamster hybrid panel confirmed single gene copy number and
localization to 11q13.

By FISH, Gerace et al. (2001) mapped the Vegfb gene to mouse chromosome
19B.

ANIMAL MODEL

Bellomo et al. (2000) described the Vegfb -/- mouse. Unlike Vegfa -/-
mice, which die during embryogenesis, Vegfb -/- mice are healthy and
fertile. Although Vegfb -/- hearts appeared morphologically and
functionally normal in unstressed mice, Bellomo et al. (2000) found that
Vegfb -/- hearts were marginally smaller and displayed vascular
dysfunction after coronary occlusion and impaired recovery from
experimentally induced myocardial ischemia.

Mould et al. (2003) studied 2 mouse models of arthritis, antigen- and
collagen-induced arthritis, in Vegfb knockout mice. Knee joint swelling,
synovial inflammation, and inflammation-associated vessel density in
arthritic joints were reduced in Vegfb -/- mice compared to wildtype
mice. Mould et al. (2003) concluded that the reduction in
inflammation-associated synovial angiogenesis in Vegfb -/- mice
implicated VEGFB in pathologic vascular remodeling in inflammatory
arthritis.

Hagberg et al. (2012) showed that decreased Vegfb signaling in rodent
models of type 2 diabetes (see 125853) restores insulin sensitivity and
improves glucose tolerance. Genetic deletion of Vegfb in diabetic db/db
(leptin receptor-null; see 601007) mice prevented ectopic lipid
deposition, increased muscle glucose uptake, and maintained
normoglycemia. Pharmacologic inhibition of Vegfb signaling by antibody
administration to db/db mice enhanced glucose tolerance, preserved
pancreatic islet architecture, improved B-cell function, and ameliorated
dyslipidemia, key elements of type 2 diabetes and the metabolic
syndrome. The potential use of VEGFB neutralization in type 2 diabetes
was further elucidated in rats fed a high-fat diet, in which it
normalized insulin sensitivity and increased glucose uptake in skeletal
muscle and heart. Hagberg et al. (2012) concluded that the vascular
endothelium can function as an efficient barrier to excess muscle lipid
uptake even under conditions of severe obesity and type 2 diabetes, and
that this barrier can be maintained by inhibition of VEGFB signaling.

601011	TITLE *601011 CALCIUM CHANNEL, VOLTAGE-DEPENDENT, P/Q TYPE, ALPHA-1A SUBUNIT; CACNA1A
;;CALCIUM CHANNEL, L TYPE, ALPHA-1 POLYPEPTIDE, ISOFORM 4; CACNL1A4;;
CaV2.1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The CACNA1A gene encodes the transmembrane pore-forming subunit of the
P/Q-type or CaV2.1 voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) (Kordasiewicz et
al., 2006). Voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channels not only mediate the entry
of Ca(2+) ions into excitable cells but are also involved in a variety
of Ca(2+)-dependent processes, including muscle contraction, hormone or
neurotransmitter release, and gene expression. Diriong et al. (1995)
noted that calcium channels are multisubunit complexes and that the
channel activity is directed by a pore-forming alpha-1 subunit, which is
often sufficient to generate voltage-sensitive Ca(2+) channel activity.
There are at least 6 classes of alpha-1 subunits: alpha-1A, B, C, D, E,
and S, which are derived from 6 genes representing members of a gene
family. The auxiliary subunits beta (e.g., 114207), alpha-2/delta, and
gamma (e.g., 114209) regulate channel activity.

CLONING

Ophoff et al. (1996) characterized the CACNL1A4 gene and reported the
amino acid sequence for residues 1-2262 of the protein. Northern
analysis detected a 9.8-kb transcript in cerebellum, cerebral cortex,
thalamus, and hypothalamus.

Kordasiewicz et al. (2006) showed that a 75-kD human polypeptide
consisting of C terminus of CACNA1A is cleaved from the full-length
protein and is present in the nucleus of HEK293 cells, as well as in
mouse and human cerebellar Purkinje cells. Nuclear translocation
depended partly on the presence of 3 nuclear localization signals within
the C terminus.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ophoff et al. (1996) characterized the CACNL1A4 gene in preparation for
a mutation search in neurologic disorders that map to 19p13. They found
that the gene covers 300 kb with 47 exons. Sequencing of all exons and
their surroundings revealed polymorphic variations, including a
(CA)n-repeat (D19S1150) and a (CAG)n-repeat in the 3-prime-UTR.

Trettel et al. (2000) determined that the CACNL1A4 gene is alternatively
spliced. A second isoform contains an alternative exon 37 that differs
from the first by 97 nucleotides.

MAPPING

By FISH, Diriong et al. (1995) assigned the CACNA1A gene to chromosome
19p13.

GENE FUNCTION

Ca(2+) currents have been described on the basis of their biophysical
and pharmacologic properties and include L-, N-, T-, P-, Q-, and R-
types. The distinctive properties of these Ca(2+) channel types are
related primarily to the expression of a variety of alpha-1 isoforms
(Dunlap et al., 1995). The alpha-1A isoform is abundantly expressed in
neuronal tissue and corresponds to the P/Q Ca(2+) channel type. The B
and E isoforms are also expressed in neuronal tissue and correspond to
the N-type and R-type of Ca(2+) channels, respectively (Lehmann-Horn and
Jurkat-Rott, 1999). The genes encoding the alpha-1A, B, and E isoforms
are symbolized CACNL1A4 or CACNA1A, CACNL1A5 (601012), and CACNL1A6
(601013) and are located on 19p13, 9q34 and 1q25-q31, respectively
(Diriong et al., 1995).

Alpha-1C, D, and S are involved with L-type Ca(2+) channels and are
referred to as cardiac, neuroendocrine/brain, and skeletal muscle
isoforms, respectively. They are encoded, respectively, by the CACNL1A1
gene (114205) on 12p13.3, the CACNL1A2 gene (114206) on 3p14.3, and the
CACNL1A3 gene (114208) on 1q31-q32.

Takamori et al. (1997) and Takamori (2004) presented evidence suggesting
that the alpha-1A subunit of the P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channel
contains antigenic sites implicated in Lambert-Eaton myasthenic
syndrome.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Nishimune et al. (2004) showed that laminin beta-2 (150325), a component
of the synaptic cleft at the neuromuscular junction, binds directly to
calcium channels that are required for neurotransmitter release from
motor nerve terminals. This interaction leads to clustering of channels
which in turn recruit other presynaptic components. Perturbation of this
interaction in vivo results in disassembly of neurotransmitter release
sites, resembling defects previously observed in an autoimmune
neuromuscular disorder, Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (600003).
Nishimune et al. (2004) concluded that their results identify an
extracellular ligand of the voltage-gated calcium channel as well as a
new laminin receptor, suggest a model for the development of nerve
terminals, and provide clues to the pathogenesis of a synaptic disease.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Episodic Ataxia Type 2

In 2 unrelated patients with episodic ataxia type 2 (EA2; 108500),
Ophoff et al. (1996) identified 2 mutations in the CACNA1A gene
resulting in a disrupted reading frame. The first of these was deletion
of a single C, nucleotide 4073 in codon 1266 (601011.0005), leading to a
frameshift in the putative translation product with a stop codon in the
next exon (codon 1294). See also 601011.0006.

Eunson et al. (2005) identified 2 splice site mutations in the CACNA1A
gene in 2 unrelated families with EA2.

Riant et al. (2010) identified 4 different exonic deletions in the
CACNA1A gene in 4 (14%) of 27 patients with episodic ataxia, in whom
sequencing analysis was negative for CACNA1A point mutations. The EA2
phenotype in the patients with deletion was similar to that of patients
with point mutations. The findings indicated that screening for
deletions in the CACNA1A gene should also be done for a complete genetic
workup.

Labrum et al. (2009) used multiplex ligation-dependent probe
amplification (MLPA) to screen for large-scale genetic rearrangements in
CACNA1A in 53 patients with a clinical diagnosis of episodic ataxia type
2 (EA2; 108500) or familial hemiplegic migraine type 1 (FHM1; 141500) in
whom sequencing analysis was negative for CACNA1A point mutations.
Labrum et al. (2009) identified 5 previously unreported large-scale
deletions in the CACNA1A gene in 6 families with EA2 and the first
pathogenic duplication in CACNA1A in an index patient with isolated
episodic diplopia without ataxia (601011.0030) whose father reportedly
had typical EA2 (601011.0030). Labrum et al. (2009) suggested that
large-scale deletions and duplications can cause CACNA1A-associated
channelopathies and that screening for large-scale rearrangements by
rapid techniques such as MLPA should be considered as a first-line
approach for genetic diagnostic testing of CACNA1A-associated
channelopathies.

- Familial Hemiplegic Migraine

In 5 unrelated families with familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM; 141500),
Ophoff et al. (1996) identified 4 different missense mutations in the
CACNA1A gene (601011.0001-601011.0004). The authors raised the
possibility that a similar defect may be involved in common types of
migraine. Based on their mutational findings, Ophoff et al. (1996)
suggested that FHM and EA2 are allelic channelopathies.

To determine the pathophysiologic consequences of missense mutations in
the pore-forming human alpha-1A subunit of neuronal P/Q-type calcium
channels associated with FHM, Kraus et al. (1998) introduced 4 single
mutations (R192Q, 601011.0001; T666M, 601011.0002; V714A, 601011.0003;
and I1811L, 601011.0004) into alpha-1A and investigated possible changes
in channel function after functional expression of mutant subunits in
Xenopus laevis oocytes. Changes in channel gating were observed for
mutants T666M, V714A, and I1811L, but not for R192Q. Barium current
inactivation was slightly faster in mutants T666M and V714A than in
wildtype. The time course of recovery from channel inactivation was
slower than in wildtype in T666M and accelerated in V714A and I1811L.
Kraus et al. (1998) concluded that 3 of the 4 FHM mutations, located at
the putative channel pore, alter inactivation gating and provide a
pathophysiologic basis for the postulated neuronal instability in
patients with FHM.

Kraus et al. (2000) continued their channel function studies with 3
additional mutations associated with FHM, including D715E (601011.0010)
and V1457L (601011.0019). All 3 mutations significantly shifted the
voltage dependence of activation to more negative potentials, resulting
in altered calcium signaling by increasing channel activity at weak
depolarizations. The authors suggested that these gating abnormalities
underlie channel dysfunction in FHM.

Tottene et al. (2002) extended single-channel analysis to human
voltage-gated P/Q type calcium channels (Ca(v)2.1) containing the V1457L
mutation. This mutation increased the channel open probability by
shifting its activation to more negative voltages and reduced both the
unitary conductance and the density of functional channels in the
membrane. To investigate the possibility of changes in Ca(v)2.1 function
common to all FHM mutations, Tottene et al. (2002) calculated the
product of single-channel current and open probability as a measure of
calcium ion influx through single Ca(v)2.1 channels. All 5 FHM mutants
analyzed showed a single-channel calcium ion influx larger than
wildtype. They also expressed the FHM mutants in cerebellar granular
cells from mice null for the mutation. The FHM mutations invariably led
to a decrease of the maximal Ca(v)2.1 current density in neurons. The
data showed that mutational changes of functional channel densities can
be different in different cell types, and uncovered 2 functional effects
common to all FHM mutations analyzed: increase of single-channel calcium
ion influx and decrease of maximal Ca(v)2.1 current density in neurons.
Tottene et al. (2002) hypothesized that these 2 apparently contradictory
effects may underlie parallel processes of migraine and aura. This
notion came from the clinical evidence that the migraine aura and the
headache are not necessarily sequential, and that the aura may not be
the trigger for the pain.

By studying mouse hippocampal neurons transfected with 4 human
FHM1-related CACNA1A mutations (R192Q, T666M, V714A, and I1811L), Cao
and Tsien (2005) observed that all 4 mutations resulted in decreased
channel current without a change in voltage dependence. The mutant P/Q
calcium channels were associated with a defect in GABA inhibitory
transmission, although overall basal inhibitory transmission remained
well preserved owing to a shift to N-type calcium channels. This shift
increased the susceptibility to G protein-coupled modulation of
presynaptic neurotransmission, which may be weakened in a heightened
state of neuromodulation, like that provoked by triggers of migraine
such as stress.

In approximately 20% of cases of FHM, the disease is associated with a
mild permanent cerebellar ataxia which may be progressive (PCA). The
CACNA1A gene is involved in about 50% of unselected hemiplegic migraine
families and in all families with FHM/PCA. Ducros et al. (1999) screened
16 families and 3 nonfamilial cases with HPM/PCA for specific CACNA1A
mutations and found 9 families and 1 nonfamilial case with the same
T666M mutation (601011.0002), 1 novel mutation (D715E; 601011.0010) in 1
family, and no CAG repeat expansion. Both T666M and D715E substitutions
were absent in 12 probands belonging to pure HPM families whose disease
appeared to be linked to CACNA1A. Finally, haplotyping with neighboring
markers suggested that T666M arose through recurrent mutational events.
These data suggested that the PCA observed in 20% of HPM families
results from specific pathophysiologic mechanisms.

Ducros et al. (2001) found 9 mutations in the CACNA1A gene in 15 of 16
probands of families affected by hemiplegic migraine and cerebellar
signs, in 2 of 3 subjects with sporadic hemiplegic migraine and
cerebellar signs, and in 4 of 12 probands of families affected by pure
hemiplegic migraine. Genotyping of probands and relatives identified a
total of 117 subjects with mutations whose clinical manifestations were
assessed in detail. Of the subjects with mutations, 89% had attacks of
hemiplegic migraine. One-third had severe attacks with coma, prolonged
hemiplegia, or both, with full recovery. All 9 mutations, including 5
newly identified ones, were missense mutations. Six mutations were
associated with hemiplegic migraine and cerebellar signs, and 83% of the
subjects with these 6 mutations had nystagmus, ataxia, or both. Three
mutations were associated with pure hemiplegic migraine.

Kim et al. (1998) sought mutations in the CACNA1A gene in 9 propositi of
families with migraine headaches and episodic vertigo inherited in an
autosomal dominant pattern. All 47 exons and flanking introns were
subjected to SSCP analysis of PCR-amplified genomic DNA. Several
polymorphisms were found, but no mutations were identified in any of the
47 exons of the 9 patients. They also determined the CAG repeat length
at the 3-prime end of CACNA1A. No index case had a CAG repeat length
greater than 13 (normal less than 17). Thus, mutations in CACNA1A must
be uncommon in families with migraine headaches and episodic vertigo.
Other ion channel genes expressed in the brain and inner ear remained
candidate genes.

Labrum et al. (2009) used multiplex ligation-dependent probe
amplification to screen for large-scale genetic rearrangements in
CACNA1A in 53 patients with a clinical diagnosis of episodic ataxia type
2 or familial hemiplegic migraine type 1 in whom sequencing analysis was
negative for CACNA1A point mutations. They identified a large-scale
deletion in 1 patient with FHM1 (601011.0034) and in several patients
with EA2.

- Spinocerebellar Ataxia 6

Zhuchenko et al. (1997) identified expansion of a CAG repeat
(601011.0007) predicted to code for polyglutamine in the C-terminal
coding region of the CACNL1A4 gene in families with slowly progressive
spinocerebellar ataxia designated SCA6 (183086).

Analysis of CAG repeat expansion in the CACNL1A4 gene by Ishikawa et al.
(1997) revealed expansion in 8 of 15 Japanese families with autosomal
dominant cerebellar ataxia; all affected individuals had larger alleles
(range of CAG repeats 21 to 25), compared with alleles observed in
neurologically normal Japanese (range 5 to 20 repeats). Inverse
correlation between the CAG-repeat number and the age of onset was found
in affected individuals with expansion. The number of CAG repeats in
expanded chromosomes was completely stable within each family, which was
consistent with the fact that anticipation was not statistically proved
in these SCA6 families. Ishikawa et al. (1997) concluded that more than
half of Japanese cases of ADPCA map to 19p and are strongly associated
with the mild CAG expansion in the SCA6/CACNL1A4 gene.

Using a whole-cell voltage clamp technique, Toru et al. (2000)
demonstrated functional alterations of human alpha-1A channels carrying
various polyglutamine lengths in a model of SCA6. Alpha-1A channels
lacking an asparagine-proline (NP) stretch in domain IV corresponded to
P-type channels expressed in Purkinje cells, the main cell that is
degenerated in SCA6. Polyglutamine elongation caused a proportional
negative shift of voltage-dependent inactivation, and the authors
hypothesized that the resulting reduction of calcium influx may
contribute to Purkinje cell death.

Kordasiewicz et al. (2006) found that the 75-kD C-terminal fragment of
CACNA1A, which is the location of the polyglutamine tract expanded in
SCA6, is cleaved from the full-length protein and translocated to the
nucleus, where it is toxic to cells when in the expanded state. The
polyglutamine-mediated cell toxicity was dependent on nuclear
localization, suggesting that specific processing and localization of
the mutant protein is involved in the pathogenesis of SCA6.

Li et al. (2009) confirmed that C-terminal fragments of CACNA1A
localized predominantly to the nucleus of HEK293 cells where they
existed as speckle-like structures resembling promyelocytic leukemia
nuclear bodies (PMLNBs). HEK293 cells expressing an expanded (24 CAG
repeats) C-terminal end of CACNA1A showed decreased viability when
exposed to toxic cadmium compared to cells with nonexpanded (13 CAG)
repeats. However, there were no differences in viability under normal
culture conditions. Cadmium treatment also disrupted PMLNBs and enhanced
aggregation of C-terminal CACNA1A fragments, particularly in
CAG-expanded cells. Immunocytochemical studies showed that
cadmium-induced death was caspase-3 (CASP3; 600636)-dependent,
indicating apoptosis. Gene expression studies showed downregulation of
the HSF1 (140580)-HSPA1A (140550) axis as an event in 24-CAG repeat
cells that appeared to be critical for cellular toxicity. The findings
were consistent with SCA6 pathogenesis being related to polyglutamine
diseases.

- Idiopathic Generalized Epilepsy

Chioza et al. (2001) provided direct evidence that the CACNA1A gene is
involved in the etiology of idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE;
600669). They analyzed 4 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from
patients with IGE and found that 1 of them, SNP8, showed significant
association with the disease. Because SNP8 is a silent polymorphism, the
authors suggested that the association must be with a closely linked
variant.

PATHOGENESIS

Ackerman and Clapham (1997) provided a comprehensive review of the role
of ion channel defects in disease. They provided useful illustrations of
the physiology and structure of ion channels and of patch-clamp
measurement of ion channel activity. They also discussed the design and
use of drugs that target ion channels.

- Drug Design

Hoffman and Gardner (1997) pointed out that a drug designed to correct
for the calcium-channel defect in patients with mutations of the
CACNL1A4 gene may need to be completely 'phenotype-specific' as well as
'channel-specific' and may need to modulate the activity of the calcium
channel differently between several disorders, despite the shared site
of the biochemical defect. Conceivably, inhibitors of channel function
may be effective in disorders caused by change-of-function mutations
(e.g., in patients with hemiplegic migraine), whereas agents that
stimulate the same channel might be beneficial in patients with
loss-of-function mutations (such as those in episodic ataxia). Drugs
that modulate the level of function of the channels may have little
efficacy in patients with the SCA6 phenotype, since this disorder
results from progressive cerebellar cell loss which is probably due to
neurotoxicity of the polyglutamine peptide that is mutated in the
disorder.

ANIMAL MODEL

By a positional cloning approach, Fletcher et al. (1996) identified an
alpha-1 voltage-sensitive Ca(2+) channel gene that is mutated in the
'tottering' mutations in tg and tg(la) mice. The tg mutation is a
well-studied mutation that gives rise to behavioral arrest seizures,
which may be compared to human absence (or petit mal) epilepsy (600131)
and cerebellar ataxia. The tottering phenotype also includes motor
seizures. Fletcher et al. (1996) noted that the tg leaner mice, tg(la),
suffer from absence seizures but do not have motor seizures. These mice
are severely ataxic. Fletcher et al. (1996) mapped the tg phenotype to
mouse chromosome 8 in the vicinity of the Junb gene (165161). Fletcher
et al. (1996) evaluated the Ca(2+) channel gene as a candidate for the
tg locus using RT-PCR and sequencing. In the tg(la) mice they
demonstrated a single G-to-A change in a splice donor site in the
portion of the mouse gene encoding the putative regulatory C-terminal
domain of the channel. This mutation resulted in several aberrant mRNA
species, including insertion of 98 nucleotides at position 5901/2 and
deletion of nucleotides 5763-5901, either of which altered the reading
frame 3-prime to the mutations. The tg transcript contained a C-to-A
change at position 1802 relative to the control sequence. Fletcher et
al. (1996) reported that this alteration leads to a nonconservative
proline-to-leucine amino acid substitution that may affect the pore
function of the Ca(2+) channel. Fletcher et al. (1996) noted that this
is the first gene identified as being involved in absence epilepsy.

The alpha-1 voltage-sensitive Ca(2+) channel sequence reported by
Fletcher et al. (1996) is the mouse homolog of the human Ca(2+) channel
alpha subunit, also designated CACNL1A4. It is noteworthy that the
CACNL1A4 gene maps to chromosome 19p13 in a region that is homologous to
the region of mouse chromosome 8 where tg maps.

In a provocatively entitled minireview, 'Migraines in Mice?,' Hess
(1996) compared the tottering/leaner mouse mutations with the human
mutations in CACNL1A4. She referred to inherited ion channel mutations
as channelopathies.

Thibault and Landfield (1996) used partially dissociated hippocampal
slice preparations to analyze single Ca(2+) channel activity in neurons
of adult and aged rats. They reported that total L-type Ca(2+) channel
activity increased primarily because of increased density of functional
channels. They noted that learning in aged animals was inversely
correlated with channel density. Thibault and Landfield (1996)
postulated that the observed increase in functional Ca(2+) channels with
aging could underlie the vulnerability of neurons to age-associated
neurodegenerative conditions.

Van den Maagdenberg et al. (2004) generated a transgenic mouse model
carrying the human CACNA1A mutation R192Q (601011.0001). Cultured
cerebellar granule cells from R192Q mice showed increased Ca(v)2.1
channel current densities, which were activated at more negative
voltages than wildtype channels. Neuromuscular synapses with the mutant
CACNA1A channels had increased induced neurotransmission and increased
spontaneous miniature endplate potential frequency at low Ca(2+) levels
compared to controls, consistent with a gain of function. In addition,
the intact transgenic animal showed increased susceptibility to cortical
spreading depression, the likely mechanism for migraine aura. Van den
Maagdenberg et al. (2004) concluded that the underlying mechanism in FHM
is cortical hyperexcitability due to excessive release of excitatory
amino acids in response to increased Ca(2+) influx through a defective
Ca(v)2.1 channel.

Near postnatal day 10, mice lacking P/Q-type calcium channels have
difficulty walking, have absence seizures, and are ataxic and dystonic.
Neurologic symptoms in these mice become more acute with age, until they
are unable to walk and die at about 3 weeks of age (Jun et al., 1999).
Mutant animals also show increased density of T-type channels (CACNA1G;
604065) that support low-threshold action potentials in the absence of
P/Q-type channels (Song et al., 2004). Llinas et al. (2007) found that
in vitro patch recordings of thalamic neurons from mice lacking P/Q-type
channels showed no gamma band subthreshold oscillation, and
voltage-sensitive dye imaging demonstrated absence of cortical gamma
band-dependent columnar activation involving cortical inhibitory
interneuron activity. In vivo EEGs showed showed persistent absence
status and dramatically reduced gamma band activity. Pharmacologic
blockade of T-type channels left knockout mice in a coma-like state,
indicating that increased T-type channel expression in thalamocortical
neurons was causally related to generation of absence seizures. Llinas
et al. (2007) concluded that P/Q-type calcium channels are essential for
generation of gamma band activity and resultant cognitive function.

Watase et al. (2008) found that knockin mice expressing a hyperexpanded
polyglutamine (84Q) Cacna1a repeat developed progressive motor
impairment consistent with SCA6. Knockin mice with normal 14 CAG or
expanded 30 CAG repeats did not show such defects. Electrophysiologic
analysis of cerebellar Purkinje cells revealed similar calcium channel
current density among the 3 mouse models, although all were decreased
compared to wildtype due to decreased channel abundance. Neither voltage
sensitivity of activation nor inactivation was altered in the Sca6(84Q)
neurons, suggesting that the expanded CAG repeat does not per se affect
the intrinsic electrophysiologic properties of the channels. Mice with
the hyperexpanded polyglutamine repeat showed cytoplasmic neuronal
inclusions, consistent with aggregation of mutant calcium channels.
Watase et al. (2008) concluded that the pathogenesis of SCA6 is related
to an age-dependent process accompanied by accumulation of mutant
CACNA1A channels resulting in a toxic gain-of-function effect.

Van Oosterhout et al. (2008) found that R192Q-mutant mice showed
atypical phase resetting of their circadian rhythms when subjected to
6-hour advance shifts of the light/dark cycle. Compared to controls,
mutant mice showed a more than 2-fold enhanced adjustment of behavioral
wheel-running activity and EEG patterns, as well as enhanced shifts of
electrical activity of suprachiasmatic neurons (SCN) in vivo. No
differences were observed for a 6-hour delay. The physiologic inhibitory
process appeared to be mediated by CACNA1A channel-dependent afferent
signaling from extra-SCN brain areas to the SCN. Van Oosterhout et al.
(2008) interpreted the findings as suggesting that abrupt circadian
rhythm changes may trigger migraine attacks, possibly because patients
have an inadequate adaptation mechanism.

Eikermann-Haerter et al. (2009) found that transgenic mice expressing
the R192Q or S218L (601011.0017) CACNA1A mutations had increased
frequency and speed of spreading depression and enhanced corticostriatal
propagation compared to wildtype mice after induction. Mutant mice also
developed severe and prolonged neurologic deficits. The susceptibility
to spreading depression and neurologic deficits was affected by allele
dosage and was higher in S218L than R192Q mutants, similar to
observations in humans. Female mutant mice were more susceptible to
spreading depression and neurologic deficits than males, and this sex
difference was abrogated by ovariectomy or senescence and partially
restored by estrogen replacement. The findings implicating ovarian
hormones in the observed sex differences in humans with FHM1. In a
follow-up study, Eikermann-Haerter et al. (2009) demonstrated that
orchidectomy in R192Q-mutant male mice increased susceptibility to
cortical spreading depression, and that chronic testosterone replacement
restored the lower susceptibility in mutant males. These findings
implicated androgens as a modulating factor in genetically-enhanced
susceptibility to cortical spreading depression.

Van den Maagdenberg et al. (2010) found that transgenic S218L homozygous
mice had mild cerebellar ataxia and reduced arborization of proximal
primary dendrites of cerebellar Purkinje neurons. They exhibited 2 types
of spontaneous attacks: those consistent with hemiparesis observed in
patients with FHM1 and attacks of generalized seizures that were fatal
in some cases. In addition, homozygous mutant mice developed significant
brain edema 24 hours after mild head impact, indicating that these mice
mimicked the broad complex neurologic spectrum of spontaneous episodic,
mild impact-triggered, and permanent clinical features seen in human
patients heterozygous for the S218L mutation. In vitro studies on mouse
cerebellar granule neurons showed that the S218L mutation increased
whole-cell calcium current density at negative voltages, resulted in a
leftward shift in voltage-dependent activation, and increased
spontaneous neurotransmitter release, consistent with a gain of
function. The calcium current in homozygous mutant cells was 6.6 times
greater than that in wildtype neurons. Further studies showed that
mutant mice had an increased susceptibility to successive cortical
spreading depression events compared to wildtype and mutant R192Q mice.
In general, all of the changes associated with the S218L mutation were
quantitatively more pronounced than those observed with the R192Q
mutation.

CACNA1A, THR666MET

In families with hemiplegic migraine (141500), Ophoff et al. (1996)
discovered a C-to-T transition in nucleotide 2272 of CACNL1A4, resulting
in a thr666-to-met (T666M) amino acid substitution.

Ducros et al. (1999) screened 16 families and 3 nonfamilial cases with
hemiplegic migraine associated with progressive cerebellar ataxia. They
found the T666M mutation in 9 families and 1 nonfamilial case. The T666M
mutation was absent in 12 probands belonging to pure HPM families whose
disease appeared to be linked to CACNA1A.

Friend et al. (1999) found this recurrent mutation in exon 16 in an
Australian patient with familial hemiplegic migraine.

Terwindt et al. (2002) studied 27 patients with sporadic hemiplegic
migraine and found the T666M mutation in a 78-year-old woman who had
characteristic attacks starting at age 14 as well as interictal
nystagmus, dysarthria, limb and gait ataxia, and cerebellar atrophy.

Kors et al. (2003) reported the clinical symptoms of 5 families with
hemiplegic migraine and the T666M mutation. Three of the families
displayed cerebellar ataxia, 3 had loss of consciousness or coma
associated with episodes, 1 had attacks with confusion but without
hemiparesis, and 1 had progressive cognitive dysfunction. The authors
emphasized the inter- and intrafamilial clinical heterogeneity.

CACNA1A, ILE1811LEU

In 2 unrelated families, Ophoff et al. (1996) found that members with
hemiplegic migraine (141500) had an A-to-C transversion at nucleotide
5706 of the CACNL1A4 gene, resulting in an ile1811-to-leu (I1811L) amino
acid substitution in the gene product. The mutation occurred on
different 19p13 haplotypes in the 2 families, indicating that this was a
recurrent mutation rather than a founder effect. Cerebellar atrophy is
said to occur in approximately 40% of chromosome 19-linked HPM families
but not in unlinked HPM families (Terwindt et al., 1996). Of the 2
families with the I1811L mutation, Ophoff et al. (1996) noted that only
1 displayed cerebellar atrophy and in that family only some members were
affected. Apparently other factors in this amino acid substitution
further contribute to the phenotypic variability. These factors may
include genetic polymorphisms elsewhere in the gene or at other
channel-related loci and the net effect of other ion channels on the
polarity of the cell membrane.

CACNA1A, 1-BP DEL, 4073C

In 2 unrelated patients with episodic ataxia type 2 (108500), Ophoff et
al. (1996) identified mutations resulting in a disrupted reading frame.
The first of these was deletion of a single C, nucleotide 4073 in codon
1266, leading to a frameshift in the putative translation product with a
stop codon in the next exon (codon 1294). See also 601011.0006.

CACNA1A, IVS24DS, G-A, +1

In a patient with episodic ataxia type 2 (108500), Ophoff et al. (1996)
identified a G-to-A transition in the first nucleotide of intron 24,
changing the highly conserved GT dinucleotide of the intronic 5-prime
splice junction. The mutation resulted in the loss of a BsaAI
restriction site. The brain-specific expression of CACNL1A4 precluded
testing the hypothesis that this mutation produced aberrantly spliced
RNAs by retaining the intron or utilizing other cryptic 5-prime splice
sites. Such was, however, presumably the case.

.0007
SPINOCEREBELLAR ATAXIA 6
CACNA1A, (CAG)n EXPANSION

Zhuchenko et al. (1997) identified expansion of a CAG repeat predicted
to encode for polyglutamine in exon 47 of the coding region of the
CACNL1A4 gene in families with slowly progressive spinocerebellar ataxia
designated SCA6 (183086).

Matsuyama et al. (1997) analyzed 60 SCA6 individuals from 39 independent
Japanese SCA6 families and found that the CAG repeat length in the
CACNL1A4 gene was inversely correlated with age of onset. SCA6
chromosomes contained 21 to 30 repeat units, whereas normal chromosomes
displayed 6 to 17 repeats. There was no overlap between the normal and
affected CAG repeat number. Anticipation was observed clinically in all
8 parent-child pairs examined; the mean age of onset was significantly
lower (P = 0.0042) in children than in parents. However, a parent-child
analysis showed an increase in the expansion of CAG repeats only in 1
pair and no diminution in any affected cases. The results suggested that
factors other than CAG repeats may produce the clinical anticipation. A
homozygotic case could not demonstrate unequivocal gene dosage effect on
the age of onset. See also Ishikawa et al. (1997).

Riess et al. (1997) found that the SCA6 mutation accounts for
approximately 10% of autosomal dominant SCA in Germany. They observed
the trinucleotide expansion in 4 ataxia patients without obvious family
history of the disease, indicating the necessity to search for the SCA6
(CAG)n expansion even in sporadic patients. In their series of 32
patients, onset was usually late and the (CAG)n stretch varied between
22 and 28 trinucleotide units, the shortest trinucleotide repeat
expansion causing spinocerebellar ataxia. Analyzing 248 apparently
healthy octogenarians, Riess et al. (1997) found 1 allele of 18 repeats,
the longest normal CAG repeat in the CACNL1A4 gene reported to that
time. They could demonstrate no repeat instability of the expanded
allele on transmission and no repeat instability was found for the
normal allele in 431 meioses in the CEPH families.

Sasaki et al. (1998) described neuropathologic and molecular findings in
a Japanese woman who died of lymphoma at the age of 61 years after a
7-year history of progressive pure cerebellar ataxia. Neuropathologic
examination showed neuronal degeneration confined to the cerebellar
Purkinje cells and, to a lesser degree, the granular cells, without
involvement of other CNS structures. The pathologic selectivity
correlated with the localized expression of the CACNA1A gene and
coincided with the neurologic manifestations. The father and a sister
were also affected. Each of the affected sisters was heterozygous for an
expanded allele with a repeat size that fell into the range of the SCA6
mutation.

Craig et al. (2008) identified a common core haplotype carrying the
CACNA1A CAG repeat in 45 SCA6 families from different geographic
regions, including Europe, Brazil, and Japan. The haplotype was also
present in the unaffected father of a proven de novo Japanese patient,
suggesting that the shared chromosome predisposes to the CAG repeat
expansion at the SCA6 locus. The SCA6 expansion lies immediately
downstream of a CpG island, which could act as a cis-acting element
predisposing to repeat expansion, as observed for other CAG/CTG repeat
diseases.

.0008
EPISODIC ATAXIA, TYPE 2
CACNA1A, (CAG)n EXPANSION

In a family with a clinical diagnosis of episodic ataxia-2 (108500),
Jodice et al. (1997) found a (CAG)23 repeat allele segregating in
patients showing different interictal symptoms, ranging from nystagmus
only to severe progressive cerebellar ataxia. No additional mutations in
coding and intron-exon junction sequences in disequilibrium with the CAG
expansion were found. In a second family, initially classified as
autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia of unknown type, an
intergenerational allele size change showed that a (CAG)20 allele was
associated with an EA2 phenotype and a (CAG)25 allele with progressive
cerebellar ataxia. These results suggested that EA2 and SCA6 (183086)
are the same disorder with a high phenotypic variability, at least
partly related to the number of repeats, and suggested that the small
expansions may not be as stable as previously reported. See also
601011.0007.

CACNA1A, GLY293ARG

Yue et al. (1997) studied a family in which multiple members had severe
progressive cerebellar ataxia involving the trunk, extremities, and
speech (183086). The proband started at age 15 years with gradual onset
of imbalance and incoordination. Slurred speech was first noted in her
twenties. She became confined to a wheelchair at the age of 44 years. By
that time prominent atrophy of the cerebellum was demonstrated by
magnetic resonance imaging. Two sons had episodes of vertigo and ataxia
that were not responsive to acetazolamide, consistent with episodic
ataxia type 2 (108500). Quantitative eye movement testing showed a
consistent pattern of abnormalities localized to the cerebellum.
Genotyping suggested linkage to 19p, and SSCP showed an aberrant
migrating fragment in exon 6 of the CACNA1A gene which cosegregated with
the disease. Sequencing of exon 6 identified a G-to-A transition in 1
allele, at nucleotide 1152, resulting in a predicted gly293-to-arg amino
acid substitution. The CAG-repeat expansion associated with SCA6
(601011.0007) was not present in any family member. Yue et al. (1997)
indicated that replacement of a neutral amino acid (glycine) with a
positively charged amino acid (arginine) near the center of the pore in
domain I would likely lead to a distortion of the pore region. Two
patients in the family had prominent ataxic episodes, whereas the other
2 patients had no episodes, suggesting that other factors such as
modifying genes or metabolic factors such as hormone levels may be
important in determining susceptibility to episodic dysfunction. On the
other hand, all 4 patients exhibited gradually progressive ataxia,
indicating that this pore mutation resulted in chronic increased
intracellular calcium, ultimately leading to neuronal death.

Wan et al. (2005) performed functional expression studies of the G293R
mutation in the family reported by Yue et al. (1997) and the adjacent
C287Y mutation (601011.0025).

a patient with episodic ataxia (108500). The amino acid substitution
occurred in a highly conserved position within the gene. This
represented the first point mutation that did not result in a proposed
truncated protein. One member of the family, who had inherited both the
mutation and the affected haplotype, had no clinical evidence of
cerebellar dysfunction. On examination, he had no signs of nystagmus on
lateral gaze, and his balance and cerebellar examination were within
normal limits. He did, however, experience migraines.

CACNA1A, PHE1491SER

Guida et al. (2001) reported the first functional analysis of a novel
missense mutation associated with an EA2 phenotype: a T-to-C transition
at nucleotide 4747 in exon 28 of the CACNA1A gene, predicted to change a
highly conserved phenylalanine residue to a serine at codon 1491,
located in the putative transmembrane segment S6 of domain III.
Patch-clamp recording in HEK 293 cells, coexpressing the mutagenized
human alpha-1A subunit, together with the human beta and alpha-delta
subunits, showed that channel activity was completely abolished,
although the mutated protein was expressed in the cell. These results
indicated that a complete loss of P/Q channel function is the mechanism
underlying EA2, whether due to truncating or to missense mutations.

CACNA1A, TYR1385CYS

In a patient with hemiplegic migraine associated with coma,
hyperthermia, meningeal signs, and partial seizures, Vahedi et al.
(2000) identified a de novo A-to-G transversion (TAC to TGC) at codon
1385 of the CACNA1A gene, resulting in a tyrosine-to-cysteine amino acid
substitution in the alpha-1A subunit of the P/Q-type calcium channel.
The mutation was not detected in 200 control chromosomes or in either of
the healthy parents, suggesting that the mutation is not a polymorphism.
The mutation is in the highly conserved segment 5 of the third domain of
the calcium channel, an area previously shown to be important in
familial hemiplegic migraine (Ophoff et al., 1996; Ducros et al., 1999).

of the CACNA1A gene, resulting in a glu1757-to-lys substitution. The
authors did not detect the mutation in 200 control chromosomes. The

CACNA1A, SER218LEU

Noting that familial hemiplegic migraine (141500) can be triggered by
minor head trauma, Kors et al. (2001) investigated a role for CACNA1A in
'delayed cerebral edema,' a severe, sometimes even fatal, cerebral edema
and coma occurring after a lucid interval as a result of trivial head
trauma. In 2 patients with the phenomenon from a family with extreme
familial hemiplegic migraine and in 1 patient whose parent had familial
hemiplegic migraine and whose family suffered from various neurologic
abnormalities, Kors et al. (2001) identified heterozygosity for a
mutation in the CACNA1A gene, resulting in the replacement of a
hydrophilic serine for a hydrophobic leucine at residue 218 (S218L) in
the highly conserved intracellular loop of the alpha-1A subunit. The
authors suggested a pathogenic mechanism involving ionic perturbation
resulting from inappropriately depolarized ion channels.

Chan et al. (2008) reported 3 Malaysian sibs with FHM1 due to
heterozygosity for a 935C-T transition in exon 5 of the CACNA1A gene,
resulting in the S218L mutation. The phenotype of the hemiplegic
migraine episodes was severe in the older brother and sister, each of
whom became comatose on at least 1 occasion. A history of generalized
seizures was associated with mild head trauma in the older boy and with
febrile illness in the younger boy. The older brother and sister also
had cerebellar atrophy on brain MRI. EEG studies of them during
hemiplegic attacks showed evidence of depressed cortical activity
contralateral to the hemiparesis, perhaps representing cortical
spreading depression due to a defect in calcium channel activity.

CACNA1A, ARG583GLN

In 2 Italian sisters with familial hemiplegic migraine (141500) and
late-onset cerebellar ataxia and cerebellar atrophy, Battistini et al.
(1999) identified an arg583-to-gln (R583Q) mutation in a putative
voltage sensor domain of the CACNA1A gene. The frequency and severity of
the attacks increased near the sixth decade for both patients, when the
cerebellar signs developed. Acetazolamide was effective prophylactic
therapy.

Terwindt et al. (2002) studied 27 patients with sporadic hemiplegic
migraine and found the R583Q mutation in a 16-year-old boy with no
cerebellar signs.

In a large Portuguese family in which 17 patients over 4 generations
were affected with hemiplegic migraine and/or progressive cerebellar
ataxia-6 (SCA6; 183086), Alonso et al. (2003) found that all patients
shared a common haplotype and carried the R583Q mutation. Mean age at
onset for hemiplegic migraine symptoms was in the second decade and
onset of cerebellar signs was approximately 20 years later. Four
patients, all under the age of 18 years, had only hemiplegic migraine, 8
patients had isolated progressive cerebellar ataxia, and 5 patients had
both hemiplegic migraine and cerebellar ataxia. Several patients
reported symptoms triggered by minor head trauma. Alonso et al. (2003)
postulated that the mutation, which occurs in a transmembrane segment of
the voltage sensor of the channel, may cause a shift in the voltage
dependence of the channel, leading to an increase in intracellular
calcium. They suggested that episodic ataxia-2 (108500), SCA6, and
familial hemiplegic migraine are not only allelic disorders, but may be
the same disorder with great phenotypic variability.

De Vries et al. (2007) identified a 2021G-A transition in the CACNA1A
gene, resulting in an R583Q substitution, in a patient who developed FHM
at age 13 years. The mutation was also identified in his mother, who had
migraine with aura. The findings suggested either reduced penetrance or
a common pathogenetic mechanism for both hemiplegic and nonhemiplegic
migraine.

In a 5-generation Caucasian family originating from northeastern Italy,
in which the average age of onset of familial hemiplegic migraine
(141500) was 33.8 years, Carrera et al. (1999) found a G-to-T
transversion at nucleotide position 4644 in exon 27 of the CACNA1A gene,
which resulted in a val1457-to-leu (V1457L) amino acid substitution. All
patients had clinical symptoms preceded by aura, followed by hemiparesis
and various degrees of aphasia congruent with the hemispheric dominance
of each individual. Patients did not report cerebellar ataxia or coma.
Carrera et al. (1999) noted that the location of the mutation, in the
putative pore-forming (P) region between the S5-S6 transmembrane domains
in motif III of CACNA1A, suggests a potential for interference in
transmembrane conductance.

Yue et al. (1998) reported a patient with episodic ataxia type 2
(108500) who carried a 4410C-T substitution in exon 23 of the CACNA1A
gene, resulting in an arg1281-to-ter (R1281X) mutation that predicts a
truncated product containing only the first 2 domains of the protein.
The patient experienced attacks of vertigo, truncal and limb ataxia,
nystagmus, and diffuse weakness during ataxic spells.

By use of whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, Jen et al. (2001)
demonstrated that the R1281X, R1549X (601011.0021), and F1406C
(601011.0022) mutations, when expressed in COS-7 cells, resulted in
markedly diminished barium current density and amplitude compared with
the wildtype gene. They used single-fiber EMG (SFEMG) recordings to
examine synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction in the 3
patients who carried these mutations, all of whom complained of episodic
weakness. The SFEMG demonstrated abnormal neuromuscular transmission in
vivo, suggesting that these mutations contributed to the symptoms of

Jen et al. (2001) reported a patient with episodic ataxia type 2
(108500) who also developed progressive episodic weakness beginning in
his teens. Mutation analysis revealed a 4486T-G change in exon 26 of the
CACNA1A gene, resulting in a phe1406-to-cys (F1406) change in the
putative P loop of the protein between domains 3 and 4, which may
disrupt pore formation. See also 601011.0020.

EPISODIC ATAXIA, TYPE 2, AND EPILEPSY
CACNA1A, ARG1820TER

In an isolated case of a boy with seizures, episodic ataxia type 2
(108500), and interictal progressive cerebellar signs, Jouvenceau et al.
(2001) identified a heterozygous 5733C-T transition in the CACNA1A gene,
resulting in a premature stop codon (arg1820 to ter; R1820X) between the
last transmembrane segment (IVS6) and the intracellular C terminus of
the mature protein. Functional expression studies indicated a
dominant-negative effect on channel conductance. Jouvenceau et al.
(2001) noted that mouse models of absence epilepsy and cerebellar
degeneration harbor mutations in the CACNA1A gene.

Holtmann et al. (2002) reported a family in which a father and daughter
had idiopathic focal epilepsy, episodic ataxia type 2, and migraine.
Four other family members had migraine, and 2 had reported seizures.
Holtmann et al. (2002) suggested that the cooccurrence of periodic
neurologic disorders in their family was similar to that in the case
presented by Jouvenceau et al. (2001).

MIGRAINE, FAMILIAL HEMIPLEGIC, 1
SPINOCEREBELLAR ATAXIA 6, INCLUDED
CACNA1A, ILE1710THR

In a mother and her 2 adult children who had familial hemiplegic
migraine (141500) and childhood-onset of cerebellar ataxia (183086),
Kors et al. (2004) identified a heterozygous 5405T-C transition in exon
33 of the CACNA1A gene, resulting in an ile1710-to-thr (I1710T)
substitution within transmembrane segment 5 of the fourth domain of the
protein. Kors et al. (2004) stated that the affected residue is strongly
conserved. In addition to FHM and SCA6, both children had complex
partial and generalized tonic-clonic seizures that occurred
independently of the FHM attacks and were restricted to childhood.

.0025
EPISODIC ATAXIA, TYPE 2
CACNA1A, CYS287TYR

In affected members of a family with episodic ataxia type 2 (108500) and
mild baseline ataxia, Wan et al. (2005) identified a 1096G-A transition
in exon 6 of the CACNA1A gene, resulting in a cys287-to-tyr (C287Y)
substitution in the putative P loop between transmembrane segments S5
and S6 within domain I of the protein. The mutation is adjacent to
another mutation, G293R (601011.0009), in the same region of the
protein. Functional expression studies of both mutations indicated that
the mutant channels exhibited decreased current densities (31 to 35% of
wildtype), which were partially restored by cooling. Immunofluorescence
studies showed that the mutant proteins accumulated in the endoplasmic
reticulum. The findings suggested that the mutations caused misfolding
and altered trafficking of the protein, resulting in a defect in plasma
membrane targeting. Once expressed at the cell surface, the mutant
channels were able to conduct current but with altered biophysical
properties. Wan et al. (2005) hypothesized that the episodic features of
EA2 result from altered channel function, while the interictal features
result from protein mishandling, eventually leading to cerebellar
neuronal death.

.0026
EPISODIC ATAXIA, TYPE 2
CACNA1A, 39.5-KB DEL

In 3 affected members of a family with episodic ataxia type 2 (108500),
Riant et al. (2008) identified a heterozygous 39.5-kb deletion in the
CACNA1A gene, resulting in the removal of the last 16 coding exons of
the gene. Sequence analysis of the deletion boundaries suggested that
the deletion arose through homologous recombination of Alu sequences.

.0027
MIGRAINE, FAMILIAL HEMIPLEGIC, 1
CACNA1A, ARG1347GLN

In affected members of 4 unrelated families with FHM1 (141500), Stam et
al. (2008) identified a heterozygous 4040G-A transition in exon 25 of
the CACNA1A gene, resulting in an arg1347-to-gln (R1347Q) substitution
in the S4 segment of protein domain III. Haplotype analysis excluded a
founder effect. In 3 of the 4 families, age at onset was before age 3
years. Two patients in 1 family also had focal seizures. Stam et al.
(2008) stated that the R1347Q mutation was the third most common CACNA1A
mutation associated with FHM1, after T666M (601011.0002) and R583Q
(601011.0018).

.0028
EPISODIC ATAXIA, TYPE 2
CACNA1A, 146.1-KB DEL

In 2 affected members of a family with episodic ataxia type 2 (108500),
Labrum et al. (2009) identified a heterozygous 146.1-kb deletion in the
CACNA1A gene, resulting in deletion of exon 4 Exon 4 encodes the S4
voltage sensor segment of domain I and the removal of this exon is
likely to have deleterious effects on kinetic parameters, such as the
voltage dependence of activation. The deletion was not detected in a
panel of 180 normal control chromosomes.

.0029
EPISODIC ATAXIA, TYPE 2
CACNA1A, 35.7-KB DEL

In 8 affected members of a 4-generation family with episodic ataxia type
2 (108500), Labrum et al. (2009) identified a heterozygous 35.7-kb
deletion in the CACNA1A gene, resulting in deletion of exon 6. The
deletion was not identified in an unaffected member of this family or in
a panel of 180 normal control chromosomes.

.0030
EPISODIC ATAXIA, TYPE 2
CACNA1A, 35.7-KB DUP

In an index patient with isolated episodic diplopia without ataxia,
Labrum et al. (2009) identified a heterozygous 35.7-kb duplication in
the CACNA1A gene, resulting in duplication of exon 6. The patient's
father reportedly had typical EA2 (108500). The duplication was not
detected in a panel of 180 normal control chromosomes.

.0031
EPISODIC ATAXIA, TYPE 2
CACNA1A, 7.4-KB DEL

In a proband with episodic ataxia type 2 (108500), Labrum et al. (2009)
identified a heterozygous 7.4-kb deletion in the CACNA1A gene, resulting
in deletion of exon 27. The deletion was not detected in a panel of 180
normal control chromosomes.

.0032
EPISODIC ATAXIA, TYPE 2
CACNA1A, 86.1-KB DEL

In a proband with episodic ataxia type 2 (108500), Labrum et al. (2009)
identified a heterozygous 86.1-kb deletion in the CACNA1A gene,
resulting in deletion of exons 20 to 38. The deletion was not detected
in a panel of 180 normal control chromosomes.

.0033
EPISODIC ATAXIA, TYPE 2
CACNA1A, 18.2-Kb DEL

In 2 unrelated patients with episodic ataxia type 2 (108500), Labrum et
al. (2009) identified a heterozygous 18.2-kb deletion in the CACNA1A
gene, resulting in deletion of exons 39 to 47. The deletion was not
detected in a panel of 180 normal control chromosomes.

.0034
MIGRAINE, FAMILIAL HEMIPLEGIC, 1
CACNA1A, 18.2-Kb DEL

In a patient with sporadic hemiplegic migraine (141500), Labrum et al.
(2009) identified a heterozygous 18.2-kb deletion in the CACNA1A gene,
resulting in deletion of exons 39 to 47. The deletion was not detected
in a panel of 180 normal control chromosomes.

;;CHAC GENE; CHAC;;
CHOREIN;;
KIAA0986
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

In the choreoacanthocytosis (200150) critical region on chromosome 9q,
Rampoldi et al. (2001) identified the VPS13A gene, which they called
CHAC. They identified 2 splice variants: transcript A, which contains
exons 1 to 68 and 70 to 73 and encodes a 3,174-amino acid protein, and
transcript B, which contains exons 1 to 69 and encodes a 3,095-amino
acid protein. Northern blot analysis detected 2 bands of high molecular
mass corresponding to the 2 splice variants in all tissues analyzed.
Additionally, RT-PCR detected expression in the erythrocyte precursor
cell line K562. Rampoldi et al. (2001) showed that the CHAC gene encodes
an evolutionarily conserved protein, which may be involved in protein
sorting.

Independently, Ueno et al. (2001) identified the VPS13A gene and found
that it encodes a 3,096-amino acid protein, which they termed chorein.
Northern blot analysis detected a 10-kb transcript in brain, heart,
skeletal muscle, and kidney.

By EST database analysis and RT-PCR of lymphoid cell line and brain RNA,
Velayos-Baeza et al. (2004) identified several additional splice
variants of VPS13A generated by exon skipping or utilization of
alternative internal exons. Northern blot analysis and RT-PCR detected
VPS13A expression at variable levels in all tissues examined, and
transcript encoding the 3,174-amino acid protein was the major variant.

GENE STRUCTURE

Rampoldi et al. (2001) determined that the VPS13A gene contains 73 exons
and spans 250 kb. Velayos-Baeza et al. (2004) identified 5 additional
alternative exons in the VPS13A gene, exons 7b, 31b, 34b, 68b, and 69b,
but 3 of these, exons 31b, 34b, and 69b, have stop codons in all 3
reading frames.

MAPPING

Rampoldi et al. (2001) mapped the VPS13A gene to chromosome 9q21-q22.
Velayos-Baeza et al. (2004) mapped the mouse Vps13a gene to chromosome
19A.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of 11 families with choreoacanthocytosis, Rampoldi
et al. (2001) identified 16 different mutations in the VPS13A gene (see,
e.g., 605978.0001).

In 4 affected patients from 3 Japanese pedigrees with
choreoacanthocytosis, Ueno et al. (2001) identified a homozygous
deletion in the coding region of the VPS13A gene (605978.0003).

Among 43 patients with choreoacanthocytosis, Dobson-Stone et al. (2002)
identified 57 different mutations distributed throughout the CHAC gene
(see, e.g., 605978.0004). In 7 patients, only 1 heterozygous mutation
was found; in 4 patients, no disease mutations were found. The authors
noted that small gene deletions or rearrangements may not have been
detected in these patients.

Dobson-Stone et al. (2005) stated that 75 different mutations in the
VPS13A gene had been identified in 58 probands with
choreoacanthocytosis.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CHOREOACANTHOCYTOSIS
VPS13A, ILE90LYS

In a patient with choreoacanthocytosis (200150), Rampoldi et al. (2001)
found compound heterozygosity for a 269T-A transversion in exon 4 of the
VPS13A gene and an insertion of a T between nucleotides 6404 and 6405 in
exon 48. The mutations resulted in an ile90-to-lys (I90K) amino acid
change and a frameshift, respectively.

.0002
CHOREOACANTHOCYTOSIS
VPS13A, 1-BP INS, 6404T

See 605978.0001 and Rampoldi et al. (2001).

.0003
CHOREOACANTHOCYTOSIS
VPS13A, 260-BP DEL

In affected members of 3 Japanese families with choreoacanthocytosis
(200150), Ueno et al. (2001) identified a homozygous 260-bp deletion in
the VPS13A gene, leading to a truncated protein. The families originated
from a small area in Japan, and haplotype analysis indicated a founder
effect. Some of the patients' parents, who were heterozygous for the
mutation, showed a slight degree of acanthocytosis in peripheral blood
but no distinct neurologic abnormalities except for cryptogenic abducens
palsy in 1 parent.

.0004
CHOREOACANTHOCYTOSIS
VPS13A, ARG208TER

In 3 patients with choreoacanthocytosis, Dobson-Stone et al. (2002)
identified a 622C-T change in exon 9 of the CHAC gene, resulting in an
arg208-to-ter nonsense substitution (R208X). One patient was homozygous
for the mutation and 2 others were compound heterozygous for R208X and
another CHAC mutation. The R208X mutation had previously been reported
by Rampoldi et al. (2001) in a family with choreoacanthocytosis.

.0005
CHOREOACANTHOCYTOSIS
VPS13A, 8035G-A

In 2 affected sibs from a Japanese family with choreoacanthocytosis
(200150) with apparent autosomal dominant inheritance, Saiki et al.
(2003) identified a heterozygous G-to-A transversion at the last
nucleotide of exon 57 of the CHAC gene, predicted to induce skipping of
exon 57 and premature termination of the protein. The mutation was not
detected in their unaffected mother. Family history revealed that 3
other living family members were affected and 2 deceased members were
believed to be affected. All 5 living affected members showed
acanthocytosis (approximately 15-20%) and involuntary movements. In an
erratum, the authors stated that an error in sequencing had occurred and
the inheritance pattern should have been reported as autosomal recessive
(pseudodominant). Tomiyasu et al. (2011) identified the 2 mutations in
the VPS13A gene in this family: an 8035G-A transition in exon 57,
causing a frameshift and premature termination (Ile2652HisfsTer12), and
a 1305G-A transition in exon 15, resulting in a trp435-to-ter (W435X;
605978.0010) substitution; the latter mutation was also identified in
the unaffected mother.

.0006
CHOREOACANTHOCYTOSIS
VPS13A, 1-BP DEL, 6059C

In 2 unrelated males of Ashkenazi Jewish descent with
choreoacanthocytosis (200150), Lossos et al. (2005) identified a
homozygous 1-bp deletion (6059delC) in exon 46 of the VPS13A gene,
predicted to result in premature termination of the protein.

.0007
CHOREOACANTHOCYTOSIS
VPS13A, 7-KB DEL

In an Iraqi Jewish woman with choreoacanthocytosis (200150), Lossos et
al. (2005) identified a homozygous 7-kb deletion spanning exon 23 of the
VPS13A gene. She had trichotillomania and anxiety but little
neuromuscular involvement.

.0008
CHOREOACANTHOCYTOSIS
VPS13A, 37-KB DEL

In affected members of 3 French Canadian families with
choreoacanthocytosis (200150), Dobson-Stone et al. (2005) identified a
homozygous 37-kb deletion in the VPS13A gene, resulting in the deletion
of exons 70 through 73. The deletion also encompassed the 2 terminal
exons of the neighboring GNA14 gene (604397). Haplotype analysis
indicated a founder effect.

.0009
CHOREOACANTHOCYTOSIS
VPS13A, 2-BP DUP, 3556AC

In 2 Mexican mestizo sisters, born of consanguineous parents, with
choreoacanthocytosis (200150), Ruiz-Sandoval et al. (2007) identified a
homozygous 2-bp duplication (3556dupAC) in exon 33 of the VPS13A gene,
resulting in a frameshift and premature termination. The proband had
onset at age 32 years and showed severe progression of the disorder; at
age 42, she was emaciated, anarthric, and reactive only to simple
commands. In contrast, her sister had onset at age 45 years and
primarily showed motor and verbal tics, paranoid behavior, and
depression.

604730	TITLE *604730 TUBBY-LIKE PROTEIN 3; TULP3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By degenerate PCR screening, Nishina et al. (1998) identified a novel
member of the TUB gene (601197) family, tubby-like-3 (TULP3). They
isolated human and mouse TULP3 cDNAs containing complete coding
sequences. The deduced 442-amino acid human TULP3 protein contains 2
putative nuclear localization signals, several potential
phosphorylation, myristoylation, and glycosylation sites, and a
C-terminal stretch of 15 predominantly hydrophobic residues flanked by
charged residues, which is a feature found in all known tubby family
members and which is reminiscent of a membrane anchor domain. The human
and mouse TULP3 proteins share 69% amino acid sequence identity, with
higher identity at the N and C termini than in the central region.
Phylogenetic analysis indicated that TULP3 is more closely related to
TUB than to TULP1 (602280) or TULP2 (602309). Northern blot analysis of
human tissues detected a major 3.4-kb TULP3 transcript in most of the
tissues examined, with highest expression in brain, spinal cord, ovary,
testis, thyroid, adrenal gland, and bone marrow. Mouse Tulp3 was also
highly expressed in eye and adipose depots, tissues not tested in human.
Within human brain, highest TULP3 expression was found in the
cerebellum, occipital pole, and corpus callosum.

MAPPING

By analysis of a radiation hybrid mapping panel, Nishina et al. (1998)
mapped the TULP3 gene to chromosome 12p13. They mapped the mouse Tulp3
gene to chromosome 6.

GENE FUNCTION

Santagata et al. (2001) demonstrated that tubby functions in signal
transduction from heterotrimeric G protein-coupled receptors. Tubby
localizes to the plasma membrane by binding phosphatidylinositol
4,5-bisphosphate through its carboxy-terminal 'tubby domain.' X-ray
crystallography reveals the atomic-level basis of this interaction and
implicates tubby domains as phosphorylated-phosphatidylinositol-binding
factors. Receptor-mediated activation of G protein alpha-q (G-alpha-q;
600998) releases tubby from the plasma membrane through the action of
phospholipase C-beta (604114), triggering translocation of tubby to the
cell nucleus. The localization of TULP3 is similarly regulated.
Santagata et al. (2001) concluded that tubby proteins function as
membrane-bound transcription regulators that translocate to the nucleus
in response to phosphoinositide hydrolysis, providing a direct link
between G protein signaling and the regulation of gene expression.

ANIMAL MODEL

Ikeda et al. (2001) generated a germline mutation in the mouse Tulp3
gene by homologous recombination. Embryos homozygous for the Tulp3
mutant allele exhibited failure of neural tube closure and died by
embryonic day 14.5. Failure of cranial neural tube closure coincided
with increased neuroepithelial apoptosis specifically in the hindbrain
and the caudal neural tube. In addition, the number of beta-III-tubulin
positive cells was significantly decreased in the hindbrain of Tulp3 -/-
embryos. The authors hypothesized that disruption of the Tulp3 gene
affects the development of a particular neuronal cell population.

Patterson et al. (2009) described the 'hitchhiker' mouse that carries
strongly hypomorphic Tulp3 allele and exhibited expansion of ventral
markers in the caudal spinal cord, as well as neural tube defects and
preaxial polydactyly, consistent with increased Shh (600725) signaling.
Tulp3 acted downstream of Shh and Smoothened (SMO; 601500) in neural
tube patterning and exhibited a genetic interaction with Gli3 (165240)
in limb development. Tulp3 did not appear to alter expression or
processing of Gli3, and transcriptional regulation of negative
regulators Rab23 (606144), Fkbp8 (604840), Thm1 (TTC21B; 612014), Sufu
(607035) and PKA (see 188830) was not affected.

Norman et al. (2009) generated mutant mice lacking the tubby domain of
the Tulp3 gene. They found that ventral cell types in the lumbar neural
tube, which acquire their identities in response to Shh signaling, were
ectopically specified at the expense of dorsal cell types. Genetic
epistasis experiments showed that this ventralized phenotype occurred
independently of Shh and Smo, but was dependent on the transcription
factor Gli2 (165230). The ventralized phenotype was also dependent on
the kinesin II subunit Kif3A (604683), which is required for
intraflagellar transport and ciliogenesis. In addition, Tulp3 was
required for proper Shh-dependent limb patterning and for maintaining
the correct balance between differentiation and proliferation in the
neural tube. Norman et al. (2009) speculated that, since TULP3 was
localized to the tips of primary cilia, it may regulate the Hedgehog
pathway within this structure.

300512	TITLE *300512 WD REPEAT-CONTAINING PROTEIN 13; WDR13
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By screening a human testis cDNA library, Singh et al. (2003) cloned
WDR13. The deduced 485-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular
mass of 53 kD. The N-terminal domain of WDR13 contains several consensus
phosphorylation sites, and the C terminus contains 6 WD repeats. Singh
et al. (2003) also identified a splice variant that encodes a 393-amino
acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 43 kD. Northern blot
analysis detected variable expression of transcripts at about 3.0 and
2.0 kb in all tissues examined. RNA dot blot analysis confirmed
widespread expression in adult and fetal tissues. Transfection of the
WDR13 splice variants in Chinese hamster ovary cells demonstrated
expression of the 53-kD isoform in the nucleus and expression of the
43-kD isoform in both cytoplasm and nucleus.

GENE STRUCTURE

Singh et al. (2003) determined that the WDR13 gene contains 9 exons and
spans 7.3 kb. The promoter region contains a GC box and binding sites
for AP1 (see JUN, 165160), SP1 (189906), and GATA1 (305371).

MAPPING

By FISH and genomic sequence analysis, Singh et al. (2003) mapped the
WDR13 gene to chromosome Xp11.23.

604881	TITLE *604881 RABPHILIN 3A-LIKE; RPH3AL
;;NOC2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a DNA fragment encoding the Rab3A (179490)-binding domain of a
mouse rabphilin-3A (RPH3A; 612159) cDNA, Kotake et al. (1997) probed a
rat islet cDNA library under low stringency and identified rat Rph3al,
which they designated Noc2. A full-length Noc2 clone was isolated from a
rat insulin-secreting cell line cDNA library. The Noc2 cDNA encodes a
302-amino acid protein that shows 40.7% amino acid identity and 77.9%
similarity to the N-terminal region of rat rabphilin-3A. However, it
lacks the C2 domains, and hence the Noc2 (no C2 domain) designation.
Noc2 contains 1 potential protein kinase A and 3 potential protein
kinase C phosphorylation sites. RNA blot analysis revealed that a single
2.2- or 2.6-kb transcript of Noc2 is expressed at very high levels in
pancreatic islets, and at low to moderate or high levels in other
endocrine tissues and hormone-secreting cell lines, but at very low
levels in brain. Screening a mouse embryonic cDNA library with the yeast
2-hybrid system, Kotake et al. (1997) showed that Noc2 interacts with
the LIM domain-containing protein zyxin (602002), a component of the
cytoskeleton. The authors suggested that Noc2 is probably involved in
regulated exocytosis in endocrine cells by interacting with the
cytoskeleton.

Using cDNA selection, Smith et al. (1999) identified a human transcript
spanning a common deletion on 17p13.3 found in approximately 40% of
medulloblastomas. The full-length coding sequence predicted a 315-amino
acid protein displaying 77% amino acid identity with the rat Noc2
(Rph3al) protein. Northern blot analysis detected moderate to high
expression of a 2.6-kb RPH3AL transcript in thyroid, ovary, stomach,
heart, pancreas, skeletal muscle, kidney, and liver.

GENE STRUCTURE

Smith et al. (1999) determined that the RPH3AL gene contains 9 exons.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Smith et al. (1999) determined that at least 1 exon of the RPH3AL gene
maps within the common 9-kb deletion on chromosome 17p13.3 found in
medulloblastomas. However, they found no mutations in this gene in 33
tumor samples with allelic loss of 17p13, including 10 medulloblastomas,
14 follicular thyroid cancers, and 9 ovarian cancers.

611422	TITLE *611422 MEIOTIC NUCLEAR DIVISION 1, S. CEREVISIAE. HOMOLOG OF; MND1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The product of the MND1 gene associates with HOP2 (608665) to form a
stable heterodimeric complex that binds DNA and stimulates the
recombinase activity of RAD51 (179617) and DMC1 (602721) (Chi et al.,
2007). Both the MND1 and HOP2 genes are indispensable for meiotic
recombination.

GENE FUNCTION

Tsubouchi and Roeder (2002) found that Mnd1-null yeast cells arrested in
meiotic prophase, with most double-strand breaks unrepaired.
Synaptonemal complex formation was incomplete, and homolog pairing was
severely reduced. Mnd1 localized to chromatin throughout meiotic
prophase, and this localization required Hop2. Mnd1 localized to
chromosomes even in mutants that failed to initiate meiotic
recombination. Hop2 and Mnd1 proteins coimmunoprecipitated from meiotic
cell extracts. Tsubouchi and Roeder (2002) concluded that HOP2 and MND1
work as a complex to promote meiotic chromosome pairing and
double-strand break repair.

Enomoto et al. (2006) demonstrated that coexpression of human MND1 and
HOP2 in E. coli resulted in the formation of stable heterodimers. The
HOP2-MND1 complex stimulated DMC1- and RAD51-mediated DNA strand
exchange, and preferentially bound to a 3-stranded DNA branch, which
mimics the strand-exchange intermediate. Enomoto et al. (2006) concluded
that the HOP2-MND1 complex may ensure proper pairing between homologous
chromosomes by stimulating strand exchange during meiosis.

Chi et al. (2007) showed that the Hop2 component of the mouse
recombinant Hop2-Mnd1 complex was the major DNA-binding subunit, and
that Mnd1 interacted with Rad51. Hop2-Mnd1 stabilized the
Rad51-single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) nucleoprotein filament, and enhanced
the ability of the Rad51-ssDNA nucleoprotein filament to capture duplex
DNA, which is an obligatory step in the formation of the synaptic
complex critical for DNA joint formation.

Pezza et al. (2007) found that the mouse Hop2-Mnd1 complex stimulated
Dmc1 to promote synaptic complex formation on long duplex DNAs. Synaptic
alignment was a consequence of the ability of Hop2-Mnd1 to stabilize
Dmc1-ssDNA nucleoprotein complex and facilitate the conjoining of DNA
molecules through the capture of double-stranded DNA by the Dmc1-ssDNA
nucleoprotein filament.

MAPPING

Hartz (2007) mapped the MND1 gene to chromosome 4q31.3 based on an
alignment of the MND1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AY028916) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.2).

;;SUCCINATE DEHYDROGENASE 1, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF;;
SDH1, HOMOLOG OF
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Complex II of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, also known as
succinate dehydrogenase or succinate:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (EC
1.3.5.1), consists of 4 nuclear-encoded polypeptides. In order of
decreasing molecular mass, these are the flavoprotein subunit (SDHA),
the iron sulfur protein subunit (SDHB; 185470), and the integral
membrane protein subunits SDHC (602413) and SDHD (602690).

CLONING

Hirawake et al. (1994) isolated a cDNA corresponding to the flavoprotein
subunit of SDH from a human liver cDNA library. The deduced 621-amino
acid protein has a molecular mass of approximately 68 kD and shows high
homology to the bovine heart flavoprotein subunit.

Morris et al. (1994) cloned and sequenced the flavoprotein subunit of
human heart SDH.

Burnichon et al. (2010) determined that the SDHA gene is highly
polymorphic.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Bourgeron et al. (1995)
demonstrated that the flavoprotein subunit gene is duplicated in the
human genome, present on chromosomes 3q29 and 5p15, with only the gene
on chromosome 5 expressed in human/hamster somatic cell hybrids. The
gene on chromosome 3q29 is a pseudogene.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Mitochondrial Complex II Deficiency

In 2 sibs with mitochondrial complex II deficiency (252011) presenting
as Leigh syndrome (256000), Bourgeron et al. (1995) identified a
homozygous mutation in the SHDA gene (600857.0001). Bourgeron et al.
(1995) claimed that this was the first report of a nuclear gene mutation
causing a mitochondrial respiratory chain deficiency in humans.

In a patient with Leigh syndrome due to complex II deficiency, Parfait
et al. (2000) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the
SDHA gene (600857.0002; 600857.0003).

In a female infant who died at 5.5 months of age following a respiratory
infection and was found to have mitochondrial complex II deficiency
(252011), Van Coster et al. (2003) identified homozygosity for a
missense mutation in the SDHA gene (G555E; 600857.0004). The authors
noted that the patient died in infancy before signs of Leigh syndrome
could develop.

Pagnamenta et al. (2006) reported a 10-year-old Palestinian boy with
Leigh syndrome in whom they identified homozygosity for the G555E
mutation in the SDHA gene. Pagnamenta et al. (2006) noted that the
patient previously reported by Van Coster et al. (2003) with the G555E
mutation was also of Middle Eastern origin, suggesting the possibility
of an ancestral mutation.

- Dilated Cardiomyopathy 1GG

In 15 Bedouin patients from a single tribe with neonatal dilated
cardiomyopathy (CMD1GG; 613642), Levitas et al. (2010) identified
homozygosity for the G555E mutation in the SDHA gene. The patients all
had a normal neuromuscular examination at presentation and follow-up,
and psychomotor development was appropriate for age. Brain MRI was
performed in 2 patients and showed no focal lesions.

- Paragangliomas 5

In a woman with a catecholamine-secreting extraadrenal paraganglioma
(PGL5; 614165), Burnichon et al. (2010) identified a heterozygous
germline mutation in the SDHA gene (R589W; 600857.0005). Tumor tissue
showed loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the SDHA locus. In vitro
functional expression studies in the yeast homolog showed that the
mutation resulted in a loss of SDH activity and rendered the mutant SDHA
protein more susceptible to proteolysis. Studies of tumor tissue from
the patient showed lack of SDHA and SDHB (185470) expression.
Transcriptome analysis of the patient's tumor showed a similar pattern
as that of other SDH-subunit mutated paraganglioma tumors, including
stabilization of HIF1A (603348), consistent with activation of a
pseudohypoxic pathway and angiogenesis. The findings indicated that
SDHA, like other SDH subunits, can act as a tumor suppressor gene.
Analysis of a large series of paragangliomas and pheochromocytomas found
LOH at the SDHA locus in only 9 (4.5%) of 202 tumors, suggesting that it
is an infrequent event.

HISTORY

High similarity between yeast and human mitochondria allows functional
genomic study of S. cerevisiae to be used in identifying human genes
involved in disease (Foury, 1997). A considerable number of heritable
disorders had been attributed to defects in known nuclear-encoded
mitochondrial proteins in humans. Many mitochondrial diseases remained
unexplained, however, in part because only 40 to 60% of the presumed 700
to 1,000 proteins involved in mitochondrial function and biogenesis had
been identified (Wallace, 1999). Steinmetz et al. (2002) applied a
systematic functional screen using the preexisting whole-genome pool of
yeast deletion mutants to identify mitochondrial proteins. A large
number of measurements of strain fitness identified 466 genes whose
deletions impaired mitochondrial respiration, 265 of which were new. The
approach gave higher selection than other systematic approaches,
including 5-fold greater selection than gene expression analysis. To
apply these advantages to human disorders involving mitochondria, human
orthologs were identified and linked to heritable diseases using genomic
map positions. Steinmetz et al. (2002) identified 22 human
mitochondria-related genes that give rise to disease and for which there
was an associated quantitative deletion phenotype in yeast. They also
identified new human candidate genes as the possible basis of
mitochondria-related diseases, including spastic paraplegia-5A (270800),
Friedreich ataxia-2 (FRDA2; 601992), and 2 forms of optic atrophy: OPA2
(311050) and OPA4 (605293). Deletion in the yeast homolog suggested
genes as the basis of the human disorder.

LEIGH SYNDROME DUE TO MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX II DEFICIENCY
SDHA, ARG554TRP

In 2 sibs with complex II mitochondrial respiratory chain deficiency
(252011) presenting as Leigh syndrome (256000), Bourgeron et al. (1995)
demonstrated a 1684C-T transition in the succinate dehydrogenase
flavoprotein subunit gene in a CpG dinucleotide, resulting in an
arg554-to-trp (R554W) substitution in a conserved domain of the protein.
Functional expression studies in an SDH-negative yeast strain
transformed with the mutant R554W protein showed decreased catalytic
activity (approximately 50% of controls). The mutation was absent from
120 controls.

.0002
LEIGH SYNDROME DUE TO MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX II DEFICIENCY
SDHA, ALA524VAL

In a girl with Leigh syndrome (256000) due to complex II deficiency
(252011), Parfait et al. (2000) identified compound heterozygosity for 2
mutations in the SDHA gene: a C-to-T transition, resulting in an
ala524-to-val (A524V) substitution, and an A-to-C transversion,
resulting in a met1-to-leu (M1L; 600857.0003) substitution. The patient
was the first child of unrelated, healthy parents and was born at term
after a normal pregnancy and delivery. She developed normally until 9
months of age, when psychomotor delay was noted. She could not sit
unaided before 16 months of age, when truncal ataxia and cerebellar
syndrome were noticed. There was mild hyperlactatemia, and cerebrospinal
fluid lactate was mildly elevated. Magnetic resonance imaging showed
necrotic lesions in the basal ganglia compatible with the diagnosis of
Leigh syndrome.

SDHA, GLY555GLU

In a patient with mitochondrial complex II deficiency (252011), born of
first-cousin parents, Van Coster et al. (2003) identified a homozygous
1664G-A transition in exon 13 of the SDHA gene, resulting in a
gly555-to-glu (G555E) substitution. The patient died at 5.5 months of
age following a respiratory infection. Crossreacting material (CRM) for
flavoprotein as well as iron-containing protein was decreased, and CRM
for the entire complex II was reduced even more. The observation
prompted speculation of a labile interaction between iron-containing
protein and flavoprotein polypeptides and of a key role of the amino
acid at position 555 in the interacting domain. The observation pointed
to the fragile equilibrium of intermediate metabolism in infants with
complex II deficiency. Although the patient's clinical course differed
from that in the patients with Leigh syndrome (256000) reported by
Bourgeron et al. (1995) and Parfait et al. (2000) (see 600857.0001 and
600857.0002), Van Coster et al. (2003) noted that she had died in
infancy before any sign of Leigh syndrome could develop.

Pagnamenta et al. (2006) reported a 10-year-old boy with relatively mild
Leigh syndrome and isolated deficiency of mitochondrial complex II, born
of consanguineous Palestinian parents, in whom they identified
homozygosity for the G555E mutation in the SDHA gene. The unaffected
parents were heterozygous for the mutation, which was not found in 60
controls. The authors noted that the patient previously reported by Van
Coster et al. (2003) with the G555E mutation was also of Middle Eastern
origin, suggesting the possibility of an ancestral mutation. Pagnamenta
et al. (2006) stated that both patients had comparable activities and
stability of mitochondrial respiratory chain enzymes. Biochemical
studies of cultured fibroblasts showed that the size of the band
corresponding to the partially assembled complex II differed slightly
between the 2 patients; however, their phenotypic variability remained
unexplained.

In 15 Bedouin patients from a single tribe with neonatal dilated
cardiomyopathy (CMD1GG; 613642), including 13 patients from 2
consanguineous families and 2 sporadic patients, Levitas et al. (2010)
identified homozygosity for the G555E mutation. The patients all had a
normal neuromuscular examination at presentation and follow-up, and
psychomotor development was appropriate for age. Brain MRI was performed
in 2 patients and showed no focal lesions. Levitas et al. (2010) noted
that the unaffected father of 1 of the patients was also homozygous for
the G555E mutation, and he had 3 sibs who had died at a young age due to
cardiovascular failure. Evaluation of other subunits of complex II
(SDHB, 185470; SDHD, 602690) and a candidate modifier gene (SDHAF1;
612848) showed no difference between the father, his affected son, and
other Bedouin patients. The enzymatic activity of the father's complex
II was decreased by 42% and was more similar to that of the other
patients than to the heterozygous mother or controls. Levitas et al.
(2010) stated that they did not have an explanation for the normal
phenotype of the father.

PARAGANGLIOMAS 5
SDHA, ARG589TRP

In a woman with a catecholamine-secreting extraadrenal paraganglioma
(PGL5; 614165), Burnichon et al. (2010) identified a heterozygous
germline 1765C-T transition in the SDHA gene, resulting in an
arg589-to-trp (R589W) substitution in a highly conserved residue. The
mutation was not found in 740 control chromosomes. Tumor tissue showed
loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the SDHA locus. In vitro functional
expression studies in the yeast homolog showed that the mutation
resulted in a loss of SDH activity and rendered the mutant SDHA protein
more susceptible to proteolysis. Studies of tumor tissue from the
patient showed lack of SDHA and SDHB (185470) expression. Transcriptome
analysis of the patient's tumor showed a similar pattern as that of
other SDH-subunit mutated paraganglioma tumors, including stabilization
of HIF1A (603348), consistent with activation of a pseudohypoxic pathway
and angiogenesis. The findings indicated that SDHA, like other SDH
subunits, can act as a tumor suppressor gene.

MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX II DEFICIENCY
SDHA, THR508ILE

In a boy with mitochondrial complex II deficiency (252011), Alston et
al. (2012) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the
SDHA gene: a 1523C-T transition in exon 11 resulting in a thr508-to-ile
(T508I) substitution, and a 1526C-T transition in exon 11 resulting in a
ser509-to-leu (S509L; 600857.0007) substitution. Both mutations occurred
at highly conserved residues within the catalytic flavoprotein subunit
of the complex. Each unaffected parent was heterozygous for 1 of the
mutations. The patient developed dilated cardiomyopathy at age 3 months,
and later showed delayed motor development and spasticity associated
with leukoencephalopathy.

608529	TITLE *608529 FIBRILLIN 3; FBN3
;;KIAA1776
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Fibrillins, such as FBN3, are extracellular matrix macromolecules that
perform architectural functions in most connective tissues. Fibrillins
assemble into microfibrils that can be identified ultrastructurally as
uniform, small-diameter fibrils (Corson et al., 2004).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2001) cloned FBN3, which they also called
KIAA1776. The deduced 2,816-amino acid protein has an N-terminal signal
sequence, numerous EGF (131530)-like repeats, and several 8-cysteine
modules called TB domains. FBN3 shares more than 60% amino acid identity
with FBN1 (134797), FBN2 (612570), and mouse Fbn2.

By searching for sequences similar to FBN2, followed by RT-PCR of normal
neonate skin fibroblast total RNA and 5-prime and 3-prime RACE of a
pooled fetal lung cDNA library, Corson et al. (2004) cloned FBN3. The
deduced 2,851-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of
about 305 kD. It contains multiple cysteine-rich calcium-binding
EGF-like domains, 8-cysteine modules, and hybrid modules, and these are
interrupted by a unique internal sequence rich in glycine and proline.
FBN3 also has N- and C-terminal furin (136950)-like cleavage sites, 2
RGD motifs, and several N-glycosylation sites. All cysteines are
absolutely conserved in FBN1, FBN2, and FBN3. Corson et al. (2004)
identified 3 FBN3 variants that utilize alternate first exons, but all
encode the same protein. They identified FBN3 orthologs in cow and
chicken cDNA libraries, but found only partial, nonfunctional FBN3-like
sequences in rat and mouse cDNA libraries. Northern blot analysis
revealed a transcript of about 9.5 kb in fetal brain. RNA dot blot
analysis showed highest expression in fetal lung, brain, and kidney, and
much lower expression in all fetal and adult tissues examined. RT-PCR
detected expression in all cell lines examined. Immunolocalization of
FBN3 in fetal human, bovine, and chicken tissues showed prominent
staining in connective tissues, but not in liver or in major and
peripheral blood vessels of a variety of organs. Ultrastructural
immunolocalization demonstrated that FBN3 associated with microfibrils
in perichondrium and human and bovine fetal skin.

GENE STRUCTURE

Corson et al. (2004) determined that the FBN3 gene contains 66 exons and
spans about 85 kb.

MAPPING

Using radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (2001) mapped the FBN3
gene to chromosome 19. By genomic sequence analysis, Corson et al.
(2004) mapped the FBN3 gene to chromosome 19p13.3-p13.2, about 8.0 Mb
from the telomere and near the CCL25 gene (602565).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Urbanek et al. (2007) reported the sequence analysis and fine mapping of
the chromosome 19p13.2 polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS; see 184700)
susceptibility locus and determined its impact on metabolic features of
PCOS. They performed a family-based association study using DNA obtained
from 1,723 individuals in 412 families with 412 index cases and 43
affected sisters, predominantly of European origin. Genotype-phenotype
associations were assessed in 601 women with PCOS and 168 brothers of
affected women. The D19S884 allele 8 (A8) of the FBN3 gene showed the
strongest evidence for association with PCOS of 53 variants tested (P
corrected = 0.0037). These findings strongly suggested that A8 of
D19S884 accounts for the association of PCOS susceptibility at the
chromosome 19p13.2 locus. The A8 allele is a dinucleotide repeat
polymorphism, (CA)n, in intron 55 of FBN3, 105 basepairs 3-prime to exon
55.

604693	TITLE *604693 A-KINASE ANCHOR PROTEIN 7; AKAP7
;;A-KINASE ANCHOR PROTEIN, 18-KD; AKAP18
DESCRIPTION A-kinase anchor proteins (AKAPs; see 602449) direct the activity of
protein kinase A (PKA; see 176911) by tethering the enzyme near its
physiologic substrates.

By screening a fetal brain cDNA library with regulatory type II (RII)
PKA as a probe, Fraser et al. (1998) obtained a cDNA encoding a novel
AKAP protein, AKAP7, which the authors designated AKAP18. AKAP7 contains
81 amino acids. Northern blot analysis demonstrated the expression of a
major 2.9-kb transcript in pancreas, brain, and heart as well as a minor
band of 4.3 kb in cardiac and skeletal muscle. Helical wheel analysis
showed that the RII-binding amphipathic helix domain comprises residues
29 to 42. Sequence analysis identified a myristoylation signal at the
N-terminal glycine residue and 2 palmitoylation sites at cys4 and cys5.
Immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence confocal microscopy analyses
of wildtype and mutant AKAP18 showed that the lipids are required for
attachment of AKAP18 to the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane.
Expression of AKAP18 in cells expressing cardiac L-type calcium channels
promoted an increase in cAMP-responsive calcium currents, suggesting
that membrane anchoring of PKA participates in physiologically relevant
events involving ion channel activation.

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Corsortium mapped the AKAP7
gene to chromosome 6 (TMAP stSG41406).

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Irion and Leptin (1999) cloned DDX41, which they called ABS, by PCR of a
HeLa cell cDNA library. The deduced 621-amino acid protein shares 64%
identity with the Drosophila abstrakt protein, including 100% identity
in 7 of the 8 motifs characteristic of DEAD box proteins.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the DDX41
gene to chromosome 5 (TMAP RH47489).

ANIMAL MODEL

Using temperature-sensitive alleles, Irion and Leptin (1999) determined
that abstrakt is essential for survival at all stages of the fly life
cycle. Mutants showed specific defects in many developmental processes,
including cell shape changes, localization of RNA, and apoptosis.

;;KIAA0561
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) cloned MAST3, which they designated
KIAA0561. The transcript contains repetitive elements in its 3-prime
UTR, and the deduced 1,308-amino acid protein shares significant
similarity with mouse Mast205 (MAST2; 612257) and human MAST4. RT-PCR
detected variable MAST3 expression in all tissues examined, with highest
levels in kidney, brain, and small intestine.

GENE FUNCTION

Valiente et al. (2005) showed that the C-terminal tail of human PTEN
(601728) bound to the PDZ domains of rat Magi2 (606382), Magi3, and Dlg
(DLG1; 601014), mouse Sast (MAST1; 612256) and Mast205, and human MAST3.
Interaction of PTEN with Magi2 increased PTEN protein stability, and
interaction of PTEN with the MAST kinases facilitated phosphorylation of
PTEN by these kinases.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the MAST3 gene
to chromosome 19.

609178	TITLE *609178 MIS12, S. POMBE, HOMOLOG OF; MIS12
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching for sequences similar to yeast Mis12, followed by PCR of a
HeLa cell cDNA library, Goshima et al. (2003) cloned MIS12. The deduced
205-amino acid protein contains 2 conserved blocks in its N-terminal 100
amino acids, followed by a coiled-coil region of about 50 amino acids.
Endogenous HeLa cell MIS12 had an apparent molecular mass of about 25
kD. Immunolocalization showed MIS12 colocalized at kinetochores with
CENPA (117139) and CENPC (117141), and its position during the cell
cycle was that of a typical kinetochore protein. The level of MIS12 did
not fluctuate during the cell cycle.

GENE FUNCTION

Using RNA interference (RNAi) in HeLa cells, Goshima et al. (2003)
demonstrated that reduced MIS12 resulted in misaligned metaphase
chromosomes, abnormally extended metaphase spindle length, lagging
anaphase chromosomes, and interphase micronuclei without mitotic delay.
Spindle checkpoint protein MAD2 (601467) temporally localized at
kinetochores at early mitotic stages after MIS12 RNAi. Kinetochore
localization of MIS12 was unaffected by CENPA RNAi.

Following MIS12 overexpression in HeLa cells, Obuse et al. (2004)
immunoprecipitated MIS12 in a kinetochore-associated complex that
contained PMF1 (609176), DC8 (609174), C20ORF172 (609175), and HP1-alpha
(CBX5; 604478). ZWINT (609177) also associated with the complex at
kinetochores during mitosis. Immunoprecipitation of transfected cells
indicated that MIS12 could form stable complexes with C20ORF172 and DC8.
Much weaker interaction was detected between MIS12 and ZWINT. Exclusion
chromatography revealed 3 peaks containing MIS12 and C20ORF172, but only
the middle peak, which had a mass of 669 kD, contained HP1-alpha. MIS12
knockdown by RNAi abolished the kinetochore association of ZWINT, DC8,
and C20ORF172.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the MIS12
gene to chromosome 17 (TMAP SHGC-36031).

606376	TITLE *606376 CARBOHYDRATE SULFOTRANSFERASE 10; CHST10
;;HNK1 SULFOTRANSFERASE; HNK1ST
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Cell surface carbohydrates modulate a variety of cellular functions and
are typically synthesized in a stepwise manner. HNK1ST plays a role in
the biosynthesis of HNK1 (see 151290), a neuronally expressed
carbohydrate that contains a sulfoglucuronyl residue.

CLONING

Using an antibody to HNK1 to immunoscreen a fetal brain cDNA library
expressed in a cell line also expressing NCAM (116930), Ong et al.
(1998) identified a cDNA encoding HNK1ST. Sequence analysis predicted
that the 356-amino acid type II transmembrane protein contains 3
potential N-glycosylation sites and a conserved RDP sequence that is
found in other Golgi-associated sulfotransferases. Northern blot
analysis revealed wide expression of a 3.0-kb HNK1ST transcript that was
most prominent in adult and fetal brain and adult testis and ovary.

GENE FUNCTION

Using Western blot analysis, Ong et al. (1998) showed that expression of
HNK1ST and GLCATP (B3GAT1; 151290) is necessary to form the HNK1
carbohydrate epitope on NCAM. Functional analysis indicated that HNK1ST
transfers a sulfate group to the appropriate substrate. Ong et al.
(1999) used mutational analysis to define the conserved residues
involved in maintaining the functional conformation of HNK1ST.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping consortium mapped the HNK1ST
gene to chromosome 2 (TMAP RH75259).

;;ENDOTHELIAL DIFFERENTIATION GENE 8; EDG8;;
S1P RECEPTOR 5; S1P5
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The lysosphingolipid sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) regulates cell
proliferation, apoptosis, motility, and neurite retraction. Its actions
may be both intracellular as a second messenger and extracellular as a
receptor ligand. S1P and the structurally related lysolipid mediator
lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) signal cells through a set of G
protein-coupled receptors known as EDG receptors. Some EDG receptors
(e.g., EDG1; 601974) are S1P receptors; others (e.g., EDG2; 602282) are
LPA receptors.

NOMENCLATURE

Chun et al. (2002) proposed a nomenclature scheme for the LPA and S1P
receptors that is consistent with the International Union of
Pharmacology (IUP) guidelines. According to these guidelines, a receptor
is to be named with the abbreviation of the natural agonist with the
highest potency, followed by a subscripted arabic number. Thus they
suggested that the designation EDG8 should be changed to S1P5.

CLONING

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to the S1P EDG
receptors, followed by screening a rat brain cDNA library, Im et al.
(2000) isolated a cDNA encoding Edg8. The authors identified a human
sequence (GenBank GENBANK AC011461) from chromosome 19 that is 87%
identical to rat Edg8. The conceptualized 400-amino acid rat Edg8
protein shares 42 to 49% amino acid identity with the human S1P
receptors EDG1, EDG3 (601965), and EDG5 (605111). Binding analysis
confirmed that expression of Edg8 leads to high-affinity binding for
labeled S1P. Northern blot and in situ hybridization analyses detected
widespread expression of a 2.2-kb Edg8 transcript in rat tissues, with
strongest expression in spleen and white matter tracts of the brain.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the S1PR5
gene to chromosome 19 (TMAP SHGC-53359).

which they called MMR2. The deduced 791-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 91 kD. The mature protein has an N-terminal
extracellular domain, followed by a transmembrane domain and a
C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. The extracellular domain contains 4
N-glycosylation sites and a predicted HLA (see 142800)-binding region,
and the cytoplasmic domain contains 2 immunoreceptor tyrosine-based
activation motifs (ITAMs) and several putative phosphorylation sites.
MMR2 orthologs were present in numerous species, and human MMR2 shares
98% and 84% amino acid identity with chimpanzee and mouse Mmr2,
respectively. PCR analysis detected MMR2 in all 20 human tissues
examined. In mouse tissues, strong expression was detected in brain,
with weaker expression in 7 other tissues, prior to perfusion. After
perfusion, strong expression was only present in brain, suggesting that
Mmr2 is expressed in mouse brain and peripheral blood cells. Variable
levels of MMR2 expression were detected in peripheral blood mononuclear
cells from healthy volunteers, including some showing no MMR2
expression. Expression of Mmr2 in peripheral blood cells also varied
between mouse strains.

GENE FUNCTION

By expression in human embryonic kidney cells, Shimizu et al. (2010)
showed that MMR2 specifically bound pentameric HLA-B62 (142830)
molecules.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Shimizu et al. (2010) mapped the MFSD6
gene to chromosome 2q32.2.

DESCRIPTION For background information on the acetylcholine receptor, see CHRNA1

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

By recording images at liquid-helium temperatures and applying a
computational method to correct for distortions, Miyazawa et al. (2003)
reported the crystal structure of the acetylcholine receptor of the
Torpedo electric ray at a resolution of 4 angstroms. The pore is shaped
by an inner ring of 5 alpha helices, which curve radially to create a
tapering path for the ions, and an outer ring of 15 alpha helices, which
coil around each other and shield the inner ring from the lipids. The
gate is a constricting hydrophobic girdle at the middle of a lipid
bilayer, formed by weak interactions between neighboring inner helices.
When acetylcholine enters the ligand-binding domain, it triggers
rotations of the protein chains on opposite sides of the entrance to the
pore. These rotations are communicated through the inner helices and
open the pore by breaking the girdle apart.

MAPPING

In the Torpedo (electric ray), the 4 subunits of the AChR show
conspicuous sequence homology. Heidmann et al. (1986) analyzed
restriction fragment length polymorphisms of each of the 4 subunits of
muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in crosses between 2 mouse
species. They found that the beta subunit gene is located on mouse
chromosome 11. The beta subunit gene was found to be tightly linked with
the locus encoding the different isoforms (embryonic, perinatal and
adult) of the myosin heavy chain genes which are located on mouse
chromosome 11. In man these genes are located on chromosome 17p
(160730), arguing from likely homology of synteny. The beta subunit of
the acetylcholine receptor may be coded by a gene on human 17p also.
Using a panel of human-rodent somatic cell hybrids segregating human
chromosomes, Beeson et al. (1989) demonstrated that the CHRNB locus is
on human chromosome 17. Beeson et al. (1990) regionalized the CHRNB gene
to 17p12-p11 by in situ hybridization.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a patient with slow-channel congenital myasthenic syndrome (601462),
Engel et al. (1996) identified a heterozygous mutation in the CHRNB1
gene (100710.0001).

In 3 sibs with congenital myasthenic syndrome associated with
acetylcholine receptor deficiency (608931), Quiram et al. (1999)
identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the CHRNB1 gene
(100710.0003; 100710.0004).

CHRNB1, VAL266MET

In a 19-year-old female with slow-channel congenital myasthenic syndrome
(601462), Engel et al. (1996) identified a heterozygous 796G-A
transition in exon 8 of the CHRNB1 gene, resulting in a val266-to-met
(V266M) substitution in a conserved residue in the M2 transmembrane
domain of the AChR-beta subunit. Functional expression studies showed
that the V266M mutation slowed the rate of AChR channel closure and
increased the apparent affinity for ACh. The mutation also caused
pathologic channel openings even in the absence of ACh, resulting in a
leaky channel. Cationic overload of the postsynaptic region caused an
endplate myopathy.

.0002
MYASTHENIC SYNDROME, CONGENITAL, SLOW-CHANNEL
CHRNB1, LEU263MET

In a 32-year-old male with slow-channel congenital myasthenic syndrome
(601462), Gomez et al. (1996) identified a heterozygous C-to-A
transversion in the CHRNB1 gene, resulting in a leu263-to-met (L263M)
substitution. Functional expression studies showed that the L263M
mutation interrupted the leucine ring of the AChR channel gate, causing
an 8-fold increase in channel open time and resulting in severe endplate
myopathy and extensive remodeling of the postsynaptic membrane. The
pronounced abnormalities in neuromuscular synaptic architecture and
function and the muscle fiber damage and weakness resulting from a
single point mutation were a dramatic example of a mutation having a
dominant gain of function and of hereditary excitotoxicity.

MYASTHENIC SYNDROME, CONGENITAL, ASSOCIATED WITH ACETYLCHOLINE RECEPTOR
DEFICIENCY
CHRNB1, 9-BP DEL, NT1276

In 3 sibs with congenital myasthenia and AChR deficiency (608931),
Quiram et al. (1999) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations
in the CHRNB1 gene. One mutation was a 9-bp deletion (1276del9) in exon
10, resulting in a deletion of 3 codons (426-428) in the long
cytoplasmic loop between the M3 and M4 domains of the protein. The
second mutation was a skipping of exon 8 (100710.0004), truncating the
beta subunit before its M1 transmembrane domain and abolishing surface
expression of pentameric AChR. By coexpressing the 3-codon deleted
subunit with combinations of wildtype subunits in HEK293 cells, Quiram
et al. (1999) demonstrated that the mutation impairs AChR assembly by
disrupting a specific interaction between the beta and delta (100720)
subunits. Studies with related deletion and missense mutations indicated
that secondary structure in this region of the beta subunit is crucial
for interaction with the delta subunit. The findings implied that the
mutated residues are positioned at the interface between beta and delta
subunits and demonstrated contribution of this local region of the long
cytoplasmic loop to AChR assembly.

603267	TITLE *603267 SMALL OPTIC LOBES, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF; SOLH
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The Drosophila small optic lobes (sol) gene encodes a protein with zinc
finger-like repeats, a calpain (see 114240)-like protease domain, and a
C-terminal region of unknown function. Mutations in sol cause a severe
reduction in the cell numbers of the neuropiles of the medulla and
lobula complexes of the adult optic lobes. Banfi et al. (1996)
identified a human EST encoding a protein with homology to the sol gene
product. By screening human brain cDNA libraries with this EST, Kamei et
al. (1998) isolated cDNAs corresponding to the complete coding sequence
of SOLH. The predicted 1,086-amino acid protein shares 44% sequence
identity with sol. The calpain-like domain and C-terminal region are
highly conserved between SOLH and sol, and similar zinc fingers are
present in the N-terminal regions of these proteins. Using Northern
blots, the authors demonstrated that SOLH is expressed as an
approximately 5-kb mRNA in various human tissues; additional smaller
transcripts were observed in some tissues. Kamei et al. (1998)
identified cDNAs and genomic clones encoding mouse, C. elegans, and Fugu
rubripes (Japanese pufferfish) homologs of sol.

GENE STRUCTURE

Banfi et al. (1996) determined that the SOLH gene contains at least 14
exons distributed over more than 45 kb.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Banfi et al. (1996) mapped the
SOLH gene to chromosome Xq24. Southern blot analysis indicated that SOLH
is a single-copy gene.

However, in contrast with the results of Banfi et al. (1996), Kamei et
al. (1998) mapped the SOLH gene to chromosome 16p13.3 using radioactive
and fluorescence in situ hybridizations. Kamei et al. (1998) stated that
the preliminary localization of the mouse Solh gene to a region showing
homology of synteny with human 16p13.3 supports 16p13.3 as the correct
map position.

P450, RETINOIC ACID-INACTIVATING, 2; P450RAI2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Retinoids, particularly all-trans-retinoic acid (RA), are important
regulators of cell differentiation, cell proliferation, and apoptosis.
All-trans-RA plays a role during development and in the maintenance of
adult tissues. The level of all-trans-RA in cells and tissues is
regulated by the balance between its biosynthesis and its catabolism to
inactive metabolites. The cytochrome P450 enzyme P450RAI (CYP26A1;
602239), referred to by White et al. (2000) as P450RAI1, is partially
responsible for the inactivation of all-trans-RA. White et al. (2000)
identified an EST clone from a human retina cDNA library that showed
significant sequence homology to P450RAI1. Using PCR primers, they
amplified a partial cDNA, designated P450RAI2 (CYP26A2), encoding a
512-amino acid protein that is also involved in the specific
inactivation of all-trans-RA. Northern blot analysis detected a 5-kb
P450RAI2 transcript in most tissues tested, with highest expression in
human adult brain, particularly in the cerebellum and pons but also in
the cerebral cortex, medulla, occipital pole, frontal lobe, and temporal
lobe. P450RAI1, on the other hand, did not show appreciable expression
in any of the human brain tissues tested.

GENE FUNCTION

White et al. (2000) found that transiently transfected P450RAI2 was
capable of converting all-trans-RA to more polar metabolites.
Competition experiments with other retinoids suggested that all-trans-RA
is the preferred substrate.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 3 sibs and an unrelated Turkish patient with radiohumeral fusions and
other skeletal and craniofacial anomalies (614416), Laue et al. (2011)
identified homozygous missense mutations in the CYP26B1 gene (R363L,
605207.0001, and S146P, 605207.0002, respectively).

ANIMAL MODEL

Yashiro et al. (2004) found that mice express Cyp26b1 in the distal
region of the developing limb bud. Mice that lacked Cyp26b1 exhibited
severe limb malformations. The lack of Cyp26b1 resulted in spreading of
the RA signal toward the distal end of the developing limb and induced
proximodistal patterning defects characterized by expansion of proximal
identity and restriction of distal identity. Cyp26b1 deficiency also
induced pronounced apoptosis in the developing limb and delayed
chondrocyte maturation. Wildtype embryos exposed to excess RA
phenocopied the limb defects of Cyp26b1-deficient mice. Yashiro et al.
(2004) concluded that RA acts as a morphogen to determine proximodistal
identity and that CYP26B1 prevents apoptosis and promotes chondrocyte
maturation in the developing limb.

Bowles et al. (2006) found that retinoic acid, produced by mesonephroi
of both sexes, caused germ cells in the ovary to enter meiosis and
initiate oogenesis. Meiosis is retarded in the fetal testis by the
action of the retinoid-degrading enzyme CYP26B1, ultimately leading to
spermatogenesis. In testes of Cyp26b1-knockout mouse embryos, germ cells
entered meiosis precociously, as if in a normal ovary. Thus, Bowles et
al. (2006) concluded that precise regulation of retinoid levels during
fetal gonad development provides the molecular control mechanism that
specifies germ cell fate.

Laue et al. (2011) analyzed murine embryos exposed to a chemical
inhibitor of Cyp26 enzymes and zebrafish lines with mutations in cyp26b1
and suggested that the endochondral bone fusions are due to unrestricted
chondrogenesis at the presumptive sites of joint formation within
cartilaginous templates, whereas craniosynostosis is induced by a defect
in osteoblastic differentiation. Ultrastructural analysis, in situ
expression studies, and in vitro quantitative RT-PCR experiments of
cellular markers of osseous differentiation indicated that the most
likely cause for these phenomena is aberrant osteoblast-osteocyte
transitioning.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
RADIOHUMERAL FUSIONS WITH OTHER SKELETAL AND CRANIOFACIAL ANOMALIES
CYP26B1, ARG363LEU

In 3 sibs, born to first-cousin parents, who exhibited combinations of
severe craniofacial malformation, occipital encephalocele, radiohumeral
fusions, oligodactyly, advanced osseous maturation, and calvarial
mineralization defects (614416), Laue et al. (2011) identified
homozygosity for a 1088G-T transversion in the CYP26B1 gene, predicting
an arg363-to-leu (R363L) substitution. Both parents were heterozygous
for the mutation, which was not found in 190 unrelated control
individuals. The mutation occurs within an EXXR motif that is highly
conserved across species and all human CYP450 proteins. Substitutions of
residues within this motif are known to ablate the catalytic properties
of these enzymes. Cellular cotransfection of CYP26B1-expression
constructs encoding the R363L substitution alongside an RA-responsive
luciferase reporter gene demonstrated a significantly attenuated ability
to metabolize exogenously applied RA in HEK293 cells (86% reduction).
The reduction of enzymatic activity noted for the mutant protein was
comparable to that conferred by a truncating mutation underlying a
zebrafish cyp26b1 null allele, indicating that the human mutation
constitutes a null allele.

RADIOHUMERAL FUSIONS WITH OTHER SKELETAL AND CRANIOFACIAL ANOMALIES
CYP26B1, SER146PRO

In a Turkish patient, born to consanguineous parents, with coronal and
lambdoid craniosynostosis, a large sagittal skull defect, limited elbow
extension, and arachnodactyly (614416), Laue et al. (2011) identified a
homozygous 436T-C transition in the CYP26B1 gene, predicting a
ser146-to-pro (S146P) substitution. Th3 mutation is predicted to disrupt
helix C, a broadly represented structural element in CYP450 enzymes.
Cellular cotransfection of CYP26B1-expression constructs encoding the
S146P substitution alongside an RA-responsive luciferase reporter gene
demonstrated a significantly attenuated ability to metabolize
exogenously applied RA in HEK293 cells (31% reduction). The retention of
activity by the S146P substitution was consistent with it constituting a
hypomorphic mutation.

102630	TITLE *102630 ACTIN, BETA; ACTB
;;BETA-ACTIN;;
ACTIN, CYTOPLASMIC, 1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

From studies of the amino acid sequence of cytoplasmic and muscle
actins, Vandekerckhove and Weber (1978) concluded that mammalian
cytoplasmic actins are the products of 2 different genes and differ by
many amino acids from muscle actin. In a neoplastic cell line resulting
from treatment of cultured human diploid fibroblasts with a chemical
mutagen, Leavitt et al. (1982) observed a mutant form of beta actin.
Toyama and Toyama (1984) isolated and characterized lines of KB cells
resistant to cytochalasin B. They found that one resistant line had an
alteration in beta-actin. Such cells bound less cytochalasin B than did
parental KB cells. The authors suggested that the primary site of action
of cytochalasin B on cell motility processes is beta-actin.

Using chick beta-actin cDNA as probe, Gunning et al. (1983) cloned
beta-actin and gamma-actin (ACTG1; 102560) from a fibroblast cDNA
library. They noted that the N-terminal methionine is
posttranslationally removed from the mature beta- and gamma-actin
proteins.

MAPPING

Ng et al. (1985) assigned the ACTB gene to 7pter-q22 by Southern blot
analysis of DNA from somatic cell hybrids. Habets et al. (1992)
generated hybrids that harbor only specific regions of human chromosome
7 and assigned the ACTB locus to 7p15-p12.

Ueyama et al. (1996) used fluorescence in situ hybridization to map ACTB
to 7p22. By PCR of somatic cell hybrid DNAs, they mapped 4 ACTB
pseudogenes to other chromosomes.

GENE FUNCTION

Interaction of phospholipase D (see PLD1; 602382) with actin
microfilaments regulates cell proliferation, vesicle trafficking, and
secretion. Kusner et al. (2002) found that highly purified globular
actin (G-actin) inhibited both basal and stimulated PLD1 activity,
whereas filamentous actin (F-actin) had the opposite effect.
Actin-induced modulation of PLD1 activity was independent of the
activating stimulus. The effects of actin on PLD1 were isoform specific:
human platelet actin, which exists in a 5:1 ratio of beta- and
gamma-actin, was only 45% as potent and 40% as efficacious as rabbit
skeletal muscle alpha-actin.

Localization of beta-actin mRNA to sites of active actin polymerization
modulates cell migration during embryogenesis, differentiation, and
possibly carcinogenesis. This localization requires the oncofetal
protein ZBP1 (608288), which binds to a conserved 54-nucleotide element
in the 3-prime untranslated region of the beta-actin mRNA known as the
'zipcode.' ZBP1 promotes translocation of the beta-actin transcript to
actin-rich protrusions in primary fibroblasts and neurons. Huttelmaier
et al. (2005) showed that chicken ZBP1 modulates the translation of
beta-actin mRNA. ZBP1 associates with the beta-actin transcript in the
nucleus and prevents premature translation in the cytoplasm by blocking
translation initiation. Translation occurs only when the ZBP1-RNA
complex reaches its destination at the periphery of the cell. At the
endpoint of mRNA transport, the protein kinase Src (190090) promotes
translation by phosphorylating a key tyrosine residue in ZBP1 that is
required for binding to RNA. These sequential events provide both
temporal and spatial control over beta-actin mRNA translation, which is
important for cell migration and neurite outgrowth.

In immunoprecipitation studies of embryonic fibroblasts from wildtype
and knockout mice deficient in the arginylation enzyme Ate1 (607103),
Karakozova et al. (2006) found that approximately 40% of intracellular
beta-actin is arginylated in vivo. In both wildtype and Ate1-null cells
beta-actin was stable, suggesting that arginylation does not induce
beta-actin degradation. Karakozova et al. (2006) found that arginylation
of beta-actin regulates cell motility. The majority of Ate1-null cells
appeared smaller than wildtype cells and were apparently unable to form
a lamella during movement along the substrate. In addition, Ate1-null
cells exhibited apparent defects in ruffling activity and cortical flow.
Karakozova et al. (2006) concluded that arginylation of beta-actin
apparently represents a critical step in the actin N-terminal processing
needed for actin functioning in vivo.

Nitric oxide (NO) is a paracrine mediator of vascular and platelet
function that is produced in the vasculature by NO synthase-3 (NOS3;
163729). Using human platelets, Ji et al. (2007) demonstrated that
polymerization of beta-actin regulated the activation state of NOS3, and
hence NO formation, by altering its binding to heat-shock protein-90
(HSP90, or HSPCA; 140571). NOS3 bound the globular, but not the
filamentous, form of beta-actin, and the affinity of NOS3 for globular
beta-actin was, in turn, increased by HSP90. Formation of this ternary
complex of NOS3, globular beta-actin, and HSP90 increased NOS activity
and cyclic GMP, an index of bioactive NO, and increased the rate of
HSP90 degradation, thus limiting NOS3 activation. Ji et al. (2007)
concluded that beta-actin regulates NO formation and signaling in
platelets.

The mammalian cytoskeletal proteins beta- and gamma-actin are highly
homologous, but only beta-actin is N-terminally arginylated in vivo,
which regulates its function. Zhang et al. (2010) examined the metabolic
fate of exogenously expressed arginylated and nonarginylated actin
isoforms. Arginylated gamma-actin, unlike beta-actin, was highly
unstable and was selectively ubiquitinated and degraded in vivo. This
instability was regulated by the differences in the nucleotide coding
sequence between the 2 actin isoforms, which conferred different
translation rates. Gamma-actin was translated more slowly than
beta-actin, and this slower processing resulted in the exposure of a
normally hidden lysine residue for ubiquitination, leading to the
preferential degradation of gamma-actin upon arginylation. Zhang et al.
(2010) suggested that this degradation mechanism, coupled to nucleotide
coding sequence, may regulate protein arginylation in vivo.

Glinka et al. (2010) noted that the beta-actin mRNA binding protein
HNRNPR (607201) has been identified as a partner of the survival motor
neuron protein (SMN1; 600354) that is deficient in spinal muscular
atrophy. They reported that hnRNPR and beta-actin mRNA colocalized in
axons. Recombinant hnRNPR interacted directly with the 3-prime UTR of
beta-actin mRNA. Suppression of hnRNPR in developing zebrafish embryos
resulted in reduced axon growth in spinal motor neurons, without any
alteration in motor neuron survival. ShRNA-mediated knockdown in
isolated embryonic mouse motor neurons reduced beta-actin mRNA
translocation to the axonal growth cone, which was paralleled by reduced
axon elongation. Dendrite growth and neuronal survival were not affected
by hnRNPR depletion in these neurons. The loss of beta-actin mRNA in
axonal growth cones of hnRNPR-depleted motor neurons resembled that
observed in Smn-deficient motor neurons, a model for the human disease
spinal muscular atrophy. In particular, hnRNPR-depleted motor neurons
also exhibited defects in presynaptic clustering of voltage-gated
calcium channels. Glinka et al. (2010) suggested that hnRNPR-mediated
axonal beta-actin mRNA translocation may play an essential physiologic
role in axon growth and presynaptic differentiation.

- Pseudogenes

Ng et al. (1985, 1985) showed that there are about 20 pseudogenes widely
distributed in the genome. ACTBP1 is on Xq13-q22; ACTBP2, on chromosome
5; ACTBP3, on chromosome 18; ACTBP4, on chromosome 5 and ACTBP5, on
7q22-7qter. All have been mapped in somatic cell hybrids by use of DNA
clones.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Juvenile-Onset Dystonia

In the monozygotic twins reported by Gearing et al. (2002) with
juvenile-onset dystonia (607371), Procaccio et al. (2006) identified a
point mutation in the beta-actin gene that resulted in
arginine-to-tryptophan substitution at position 183 (102630.0001). The
disease phenotype included developmental midline malformations, sensory
hearing loss, and a delayed-onset generalized dystonia syndrome.
Cellular studies of a lymphoblastoid cell line obtained from an affected
patient demonstrated morphologic abnormalities of the actin cytoskeleton
and altered actin depolymerization dynamics in response to latrunculin
A, an actin monomer-sequestering drug. Resistance to latrunculin A was
also observed in NIH 3T3 cells expressing the mutant actin. These
findings suggested that mutations in nonmuscle actins may be associated
with a broad spectrum of developmental malformations and/or neurologic
abnormalities such as dystonia.

Riviere et al. (2012) suggested that this report should be interpreted
with caution given the absence of replication studies and unavailability
of parental DNA.

- Baraitser-Winter Syndrome 1

Riviere et al. (2012) identified heterozygous missense mutations in 10
of 18 patients with Baraitser-Winter syndrome-1 (BRWS1; 243310). In all
cases where parental DNA was available the mutation was shown to have
occurred de novo. Seven of the 10 patients carried a recurrent
arg196-to-his mutation (102630.0002). One carried a different mutation
at the same codon, arg196-to-cys (102630.0003), and the other 2 patients
carried different de novo missense mutations in the ACTB gene.

In a 7-year-old girl with atypical Baraitser-Winter syndrome-1, who did
not exhibit lissencephaly or seizures, Johnston et al. (2013) identified
a de novo missense mutation in the ACTB gene (E117K; 102630.0006).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
DYSTONIA, JUVENILE-ONSET
ACTB, ARG183TRP

In the twins with juvenile-onset dystonia (607371) originally described
by Gearing et al. (2002), Procaccio et al. (2006) detected a
heterozygous arg183-to-trp (R183W) mutation in the ACTB gene. The amino
acid substitution was the result of a 547C-T transition in exon 4. The
constellation of malformations exhibited by the patients resembled Opitz
syndrome (300000), but no mutations were found in the MID1 gene (300552)
and no evidence was found for involvement of genes causing the autosomal
form of Opitz syndrome. No mutations in ACTB were identified in the
mother and 2 half brothers. Paternal samples were not available for
analysis.

Riviere et al. (2012) suggested that this report should be interpreted
with caution given the absence of replication studies and unavailability
of parental DNA.

BARAITSER-WINTER SYNDROME 1
ACTB, ARG196HIS

In 7 of 10 patients with Baraitser-Winter syndrome-1 (BRWS1; 243310),
Riviere et al. (2012) identified a heterozygous G-to-A transition at
nucleotide 587 of the ACTB gene, resulting in an arg-to-his substitution
at codon 196 (R196H). In 2 patients from whom parental DNA was available
the mutation was determined to have occurred de novo. This mutation was
not identified in 212 other exomes. Lymphoblastoid cell lines
established from patients carrying this mutation had greatly increased
F-actin content and multiple, anomalous F-actin-rich, filopodia-like
protrusions compared to control cells, resulting in an increased cell
perimeter.

One of the patients found by Riviere et al. (2012) to carry the R196H
mutation had been described by Fryns and Aftimos (2000) as patient 1 in
the original report of Fryns-Aftimos syndrome (606155).

.0003
BARAITSER-WINTER SYNDROME 1
ACTB, ARG196CYS

In an individual with Baraitser-Winter syndrome-1 (BRWS1; 243310),
Riviere et al. (2012) identified a heterozygous C-to-T transition at
nucleotide 586 of the ACTB gene, resulting in an arg-to-cys substitution
at codon 196 (R196C). This mutation was not found in 214 other exomes.

.0004
BARAITSER-WINTER SYNDROME 1
ACTB, LEU65VAL

In an individual with Baraitser-Winter syndrome-1 (BRWS1; 243310),
Riviere et al. (2012) identified a de novo mutation, a heterozygous
C-to-G transversion at nucleotide 193 of the ACTB gene resulting in a
leu-to-val substitution at codon 65 (L65V). This mutation was not
identified in 244 other exomes.

.0005
BARAITSER-WINTER SYNDROME 1
ACTB, ASN12ASP

In an individual with Baraitser-Winter syndrome-1 (BRWS1; 243310),
Riviere et al. (2012) identified a de novo mutation, a heterozygous
A-to-G transition at nucleotide 34 of the ACTB gene resulting in an
asn-to-asp substitution at codon 12 (N12D). This mutation was not
identified in 24 other exomes.

.0006
BARAITSER-WINTER SYNDROME 1, ATYPICAL
ACTB, GLU117LYS

In a 7-year-old girl with atypical Baraitser-Winter syndrome-1 (243310),
who had microcephaly, intellectual disability, and facial dysmorphism
but no lissencephaly or seizures, Johnston et al. (2013) identified
heterozygosity for a de novo c.349G-A transition in the ACTB gene,
resulting in a glu117-to-lys (E117K) substitution. The mutation was not
present in either of her unaffected parents. Patient lymphocytes
demonstrated significantly decreased ability to adhere to a
fibronectin-coated surface and formed few actin-rich protrusions
compared to the parents' lymphocytes. Studies in yeast showed virtually
complete loss of normal polarization of the cytoskeleton with the
mutant, and mutant cells were almost completely resistant to the
depolymerizing agent latrunculin A, suggesting that E117K might result
in strengthened actin monomer-monomer interactions and increased
filament stability.

607117	TITLE *607117 MCPH1 GENE; MCPH1
;;MICROCEPHALIN;;
BRCT-REPEAT INHIBITOR OF TERT EXPRESSION 1; BRIT1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The MCPH1 gene encodes a regulator of chromosome condensation (Trimborn
et al., 2004).

CLONING

To identify the causative gene in a form of primary microcephaly linked
to chromosome 8p23 (MCPH1; 251200), Jackson et al. (2002) sought a
founder effect in 2 linked families and then sequenced positional
candidates. Of 2 genes identified in the MCPH1 interval, angiopoietin-2
(ANGPT2; 601922) showed no changes. However, the other gene, which was
previously uncharacterized, showed a nonsense mutation (607117.0001) in
both families sharing the ancestral 8p23 haplotype. Jackson et al.
(2002) termed the predicted 835-amino acid protein encoded by this gene
microcephalin. Microcephalin contains 3 BRCA1 (113705) C-terminal (BRCT)
domains. It shares only 57% identity with its mouse ortholog, with the
most conserved regions being the BRCT domains, where there is 80%
identity.

Using RT-PCR of fetal tissues, Jackson et al. (2002) confirmed that
microcephalin is expressed in fetal brain. A similar level of expression
was present in fetal liver and kidney, and transcripts were detectable
at low levels in a range of other fetal tissues, as well as in a number
of adult tissues. In situ hybridization experiments on fetal mouse
sections showed that microcephalin is expressed during neurogenesis. In
fetal brain, high levels of gene expression localized to the developing
forebrain and, in particular, to the walls of the lateral ventricles.
Progenitor cells in this region divide to produce neurons that migrate
to form the cerebral cortex.

Using Western blot analysis, Xu et al. (2004) detected a 100-kD MCPH1
protein in human cell lines.

GENE FUNCTION

Lin et al. (2005) examined the role of BRIT1 in DNA damage response and
found that it was required for intra-S and G2/M checkpoints after
irradiation damage in a human osteosarcoma cell line. These BRIT1
activities appeared to result from regulation or activation of at least
3 other checkpoint regulators, CHK1 (CHEK1; 603078), BRCA1, and NBS1
(602667).

Using immunofluorescence, Xu et al. (2004) showed MCPH1 colocalized in
ionizing irradiation (IR)-induced foci with NFBD1 (MDC1; 607593) and
other DNA damage checkpoint proteins in human embryonic kidney cells
following IR exposure. Inhibition of MCPH1 expression by small
interfering RNA led to defective IR-induced intra-S-phase and G2/M
checkpoints and was associated with decreased BRCA1 and CHK1 mRNA and
protein.

Alderton et al. (2006) found defective G2/M checkpoint arrest, nuclear
fragmentation after DNA damage, and supernumerary mitotic centrosomes in
human lymphoblastoid cell lines with different truncating mutations in
MCPH1. Mutant cells failed to inhibit CDC45 (603465) loading onto
chromatin after replication arrest. They also showed low levels of
tyr15-phosphorylated CDK1 (CDC2; 116940) in S and G2 phase, which
correlated with elevated frequency of G2-like cells displaying premature
chromosome condensation. Alderton et al. (2006) concluded that MCPH1 has
a role in maintaining inhibitory CDK1 phosphorylation, which prevents
premature entry into mitosis.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Jackson et al. (2002) determined that the
MCPH1 gene contains 14 exons.

MAPPING

By positional cloning, Jackson et al. (2002) mapped the MCPH1 gene to
the primary microcephaly-1 critical region on chromosome 8p23. Jackson
et al. (2002) mapped the mouse Mcph1 gene to chromosome 8A2, a region
that also contains the Angpt2 gene and thus shows homology of synteny to
human chromosome 8p23.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Jackson et al. (2002) identified a homozygous mutation in the
microcephalin gene (S25X; 607117.0001) in 2 families with primary
microcephaly-1 (MCPH1; 251200) sharing an ancestral 8p23 haplotype. All
7 affected individuals were homozygous for the mutation, and their 8
parents (obligate carriers) were heterozygous for this mutation. The
S25X mutation occurred in the first BRCT domain and considerably
truncated the microcephalin protein.

In 2 sibs, born of consanguineous parents, with microcephaly and
premature chromosome condensation syndrome originally reported by
Neitzel et al. (2002), Trimborn et al. (2004) identified a homozygous
1-bp insertion (427insA; 607117.0002) in exon 5 of the MCPH1 gene. The
cellular phenotype showed premature chromosome condensation in the early
G2 phase of the cell cycle, which may be a useful diagnostic marker for
individuals with mutation in the MCPH1 gene. Trimborn et al. (2004)
demonstrated that siRNA-mediated depletion of MCPH1 is sufficient to
reproduce this cellular phenotype, and also showed that MCPH1-deficient
cells exhibit delayed decondensation postmitosis. These findings
implicated microcephalin as a regulator of chromosome condensation and
linked the apparently disparate fields of neurogenesis and chromosome
biology.

Darvish et al. (2010) identified 8 different homozygous mutations in the
MCPH1 gene (see, e.g., 607117.0004-607117.0006) in 8 (8.7%) of 112
Iranian families with primary microcephaly, mental retardation, and
premature chromosome condensation. Six of the mutations were predicted
to result in a truncated protein. One of the families and the
corresponding mutation had been reported by Garshasbi et al. (2006).

EVOLUTION

Human evolution is characterized by a dramatic increase in brain size
and complexity. To probe its genetic basis, Dorus et al. (2004) examined
the evolution of genes involved in diverse aspects of nervous system
biology. These genes, including MCPH1, displayed significantly higher
rates of protein evolution in primates than in rodents. This trend was
most pronounced for the subset of genes implicated in nervous system
development. Moreover, within primates, the acceleration of protein
evolution was most prominent in the lineage leading from ancestral
primates to humans. Dorus et al. (2004) concluded that the phenotypic
evolution of the human nervous system has a salient molecular correlate,
i.e., accelerated evolution of the underlying genes, particularly those
linked to nervous system development.

Similarly, Evans et al. (2004) showed that the evolution of
microcephalin's protein sequence was highly accelerated throughout the
lineage from simian ancestors to humans and chimpanzees, with the most
pronounced acceleration seen in the early periods of this lineage. This
accelerated evolution was coupled with signatures of positive selection.
Statistical analysis suggested that about 45 advantageous amino acid
changes in microcephalin might have fixed during the 25 to 30 million
years of evolution from early simian progenitors to modern humans. These
observations supported the notion that the molecular evolution of
microcephalin may have contributed to brain expansion in the simian
lineage leading to humans.

Wang and Su (2004) sequenced the coding region of microcephalin gene in
humans and 12 representative nonhuman primate species covering great
apes, lesser apes, Old World monkeys, and New World monkeys.
Microcephalin was highly polymorphic in human populations. Among 22
substitutions in the coding region of microcephalin gene in human
populations, 15 caused amino acid changes. Neutrality tests and
phylogenetic analysis indicated that the sequence variations of
microcephalin in humans were likely caused by the combination of recent
population expansion and Darwinian positive selection.
Synonymous/nonsynonymous analyses in primates revealed positive
selection on microcephalin during the origin of the last common ancestor
of humans and great apes, which coincides with the drastic brain
enlargement from lesser apes to great apes. A codon-based neutrality
test also indicated the signal of positive selection on 5 individual
amino acid sites of microcephalin, which may contribute to brain
enlargement during primate evolution and human origin.

Evans et al. (2005) presented evidence that haplotype 49 of
microcephalin, corresponding to the C allele of the G37995C SNP,
increased its frequency too rapidly to be compatible with neutral drift.
This indicates that it has spread under strong positive selection. The
G37995C SNP occurs in exon 8 and changes amino acid 314 from an
ancestral aspartate to a histidine (D314H). Position 37995 of the
genomic sequence corresponds to position 940 of the open reading frame.

Currat et al. (2006) commented on the paper by Evans et al. (2005),
stating that they had developed models of human history including both
population growth and spatial structure that could generate the observed
pattern of microcephalin haplotypes without selection. Mekel-Bobrov et
al. (2006) responded that the demographic models adopted by Currat et
al. (2006) strongly contradicted a decade of empirical research on human
demographic history and did not account for the critical features of the
data on which Mekel-Bobrov et al. (2006) had developed their argument
for selection.

In a study of 5 independent population-based samples comprising 2,393
individuals, Mekel-Bobrov et al. (2007) did not find a detectable
association between the recent adaptive evolution of either the ASPM
(605481) or microcephalin genes and normal variation in IQ.

Maghirang-Rodriguez et al. (2009) found no association between the 940G
variant of MCPH1 and microcephaly or mental retardation among 1,054
affected individuals compared to 401 controls. However, in controls the
frequency of the 940G allele was significantly higher among African
Americans (66%) compared to Caucasians (17%).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MICROCEPHALY 1, PRIMARY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
MCPH1, SER25TER

Jackson et al. (2002) identified a C-to-G transversion at nucleotide 74
in exon 2 of the microcephalin gene, resulting in a ser25-to-ter (S25X)
substitution, in 2 families with primary microcephaly (251200) sharing
an ancestral 8p23 haplotype. All 7 affected individuals were homozygous
for the mutation, and their 8 parents (obligate carriers) were
heterozygous for this mutation. The S25X mutation occurred in the first
BRCT domain of microcephalin and considerably truncated the protein.

Alderton et al. (2006) found that cells expressing the S25X mutation had
reduced, but residual, MCPH1 protein expression. The mutant protein
would result in loss of the N-terminal BRCT domain.

MCPH1, 1-BP INS, 427A

In 2 sibs, born to consanguineous parents, with microcephaly (251200)
and premature chromosome condensation originally reported by Neitzel et
al. (2002), Trimborn et al. (2004) sequenced the entire coding region of
the MCPH1 gene; they identified a homozygous 1-bp insertion in exon 5,
427insA, resulting in a frameshift with a premature stop codon in exon 6
and, thus, a markedly truncated protein of 146 amino acids encoding only
the N-terminal BRCT domain of the protein. The insertion, which occurred
within a run of 6 adenines, was heterozygous in both unaffected parents
and not present in 220 control alleles. Trimborn et al. (2004) concluded
that the cellular phenotype was due to functional loss of the
microcephalin protein.

Alderton et al. (2006) found that cells expressing the 427insA mutant
lacked detectable MCPH1 protein. The mutant transcript underwent
nonsense-mediated decay, but residual mutant mRNA was detectable.

In 6 affected members of a consanguineous Iranian family with mental
retardation, mild microcephaly (-3 SD), and premature chromosome
condensation in at least 10 to 15% of cells (251200), Garshasbi et al.
(2006) identified a homozygous 150- to 200-kb deletion encompassing the
promoter and the first 6 exons of the MCPH1 gene.

MCPH1, 1-BP INS, 566A

In 3 affected members of a consanguineous Iranian family with
microcephaly (-6 SD), moderate mental retardation, and premature
chromosome condensation (251200), Darvish et al. (2010) identified a
homozygous 1-bp insertion (566insA) in exon 6 of the MCPH1 gene,
predicted to result in a frameshift. The mutation was not found in 160
German and 190 Iranian controls.

In 4 affected members of a consanguineous Iranian family with
microcephaly (-7 to -9 SD), moderate mental retardation, and premature
chromosome condensation (251200), Darvish et al. (2010) identified a
homozygous 147C-G transversion in exon 3 of the MCPH1 gene, predicted to
result in his49-to-gln (H49Q) substitution in the BRCT1 domain. The
mutation was not found in 160 German and 190 Iranian controls.

In 3 affected members of a consanguineous Iranian family with
microcephaly (-6 to -7 SD), mild to moderate mental retardation, and
premature chromosome condensation (251200), Darvish et al. (2010)
identified a homozygous 215C-T transition in exon 3 of the MCPH1 gene,
predicted to result in ser72-to-leu (S72L) substitution in the BRCT1
domain. The mutation was not found in 160 German and 190 Iranian
controls.

MICROCEPHALY 1, PRIMARY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
MCPH1, SER101TER

In a Danish female with primary microcephaly-1 (251200), previously
reported by Tommerup et al. (1993), Farooq et al. (2010) identified a
homozygous 302C-G transversion in exon 4 of the MCPH1 gene, resulting in
a ser101-to-ter (S101X) substitution. The truncated protein was
predicted to retain the N-terminal BRCT domain but lack the 2 C-terminal
BRCT domains. The patient also had craniosynostosis, ptosis, and
bird-like facies with micrognathia. The cellular phenotype of
chromosomal sensitivity to DNA damage was particularly severe, which the
authors suggested may be related to presence of the N-terminal BRCT
domain.

607070	TITLE *607070 ZINC FINGER MYND DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 10; ZMYND10
;;BLU
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The ZMYND10 gene encodes a protein involved in motile ciliary function
(Zariwala et al., 2013).

CLONING

By physical cloning methodologies and bioinformatic computational
analyses, Lerman and Minna (2000) identified a number of genes,
including BLU, in a region of chromosome 3p21.3 that is associated with
a putative lung cancer tumor suppressor gene. The deduced 440-amino acid
conserved soluble cytoplasmic protein is 89% identical to the mouse
protein and is somewhat homologous to the MTG/ETO family of
transcription factors (see CBFA2T1; 133435). It contains a zinc knuckle
motif. Northern blot analysis revealed expression of a 2.0-kb transcript
limited to lung, with trace expression in kidney, liver, placenta, and
brain; a shorter isoform was found to be expressed in testis. BLU was
expressed in few lung cancer cell lines. Mutations were found in
approximately 5% of cell lines tested, but none of the genes identified
in the search had a high frequency of mutations. Lerman and Minna (2000)
suggested that BLU is a candidate for functional tumor suppressor gene
studies.

In mouse embryos, Moore et al. (2013) found expression of the Zmynd10
gene in the ciliated epithelial layers associated with nasal and lung
epithelium, where motile cilia are located.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Lerman and Minna (2000) determined that
the BLU gene contains 12 exons and spans 4.7 kb. The testis isoform
contains 11 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Lerman and Minna (2000) determined that
the BLU gene resides in a 120-kb critical region for a lung cancer tumor
suppressor gene on chromosome 3p21.3.

GENE FUNCTION

To evaluate the role of BLU in tumorigenesis, Agathanggelou et al.
(2003) analyzed BLU promoter methylation status in tumor cell lines and
detected promoter region hypermethylation in 39% of lung, 42% of breast,
50% of kidney, 86% of neuroblastoma, and 80% of nasopharyngeal tumor
cell lines. Methylation of the BLU promoter region correlated with the
downregulation of BLU transcript expression in tumor cell lines.
Expression was recovered in tumor cell lines treated with 5-aza
2-deoxycytidine.

Zariwala et al. (2013) found that ZMYND10 bound to LRRC6 (614930) in
HEK293T and in human tracheal epithelial cells. These 2 proteins
localized to both the basal body and the striated rootlet in Xenopus
ciliated epithelial cells. Pull-down studies indicated that the
C-terminal MYND domain of ZMYND10 was insufficient for interaction with
the CS domain of LRRC6; rather, a C-terminal fragment that extended
beyond the MYND domain was necessary for interaction between the 2
proteins. Similar studies using progressive truncating constructs of
LRRC6 confirmed that the C-terminal CS domain of LRRC6 was sufficient
for pull-down of ZMYND10. The C termini of the 2 proteins engaged in a
protein-protein interaction that was abrogated by truncating mutations
in either gene in patients with CILD. Immunofluorescence studies in rat
trachea showed that ZMYND10 localized to sites proximal to the axoneme
and colocalized to cytoplasmic puncta of varying sizes with SAS6
(609321), which is required for centriole assembly during ciliogenesis,
and PCM1 (600299), which is a component of centriolar satellites. LRRC6
colocalized with ZMYND10 to the cytoplasmic puncta, but not to the
axonemal domain. In cellular studies, knockdown of ZMYND10 using shRNA
was associated with decreased amounts of DNAH5 and DNALI1 mRNA,
suggesting that ZMYND10 can regulate transcription of dynein proteins.
Overall, the findings indicated that ZMYND10 has a role in motile cilia.

Moore et al. (2013) also found that ZMYND10 interacted with LRRC6.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of 14 families with primary ciliary dyskinesia-22
(CILD22; 615444) with or without situs inversus, Zariwala et al. (2013)
identified 11 different homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in
the ZMYND10 gene (see, e.g., 607070.0001-607070.0004). The initial
mutation was found by homozygosity mapping combined with whole-exome
sequencing in an Israeli individual with situs inversus. The subsequent
mutations were found by sequencing the ZMYND10 gene in 300 patients with
CILD. Transmission electron microscopy of respiratory ciliary epithelial
samples from affected individuals showed a lack of outer and inner
dynein arms on the ciliary axonemes, and immunofluorescence studies
showed absence of the inner-arm protein DNALI1 (602135) and the
outer-arm protein DNAH5 (603335). Truncating mutations in ZMYND10 (see,
e.g., 606070.0002 and 606070.0004) abrogated the interaction between
ZMYND10 and LRRC6, whereas missense mutations did not.

Moore et al. (2013) identified biallelic mutations in the ZMYND10 gene
(see, e.g., 607070.0001; 607070.0005-607070.0006) in 6 (16%) of 38
families with CILD characterized by inner and outer dynein arm defects
on ultrastructural analysis of respiratory epithelial cells. The initial
mutations were found by whole-exome sequencing and confirmed by Sanger
sequencing. The mutations segregated with the disorder in the families.
Most patients had a loss of inner and outer dynein arms from the cilia,
but those with the missense mutation V16G (607070.0001) had an
apparently intermediate phenotype with variable retention of the inner
and outer dynein arms. Video microscopy of most patients showed cilia
that were almost completely static, but 1 patient with the V16G mutation
had cilia with a slowed and stiff beating pattern.

ANIMAL MODEL

Zariwala et al. (2013) found that knockdown of the Zmynd10 gene in
zebrafish caused ciliopathy phenotypes, including the appearance of 3
otoliths, kidney cysts, and dilated kidney tubules. Cilia in the kidney
showed disorganized cilia bundles with either severely reduced beat
amplitude or paralysis, and olfactory motile cilia were nearly
completely paralyzed. Knockdown of Zmynd10 in Xenopus embryos caused a
defect in ciliogenesis and a weaker flow.

Moore et al. (2013) found that the Drosophila Zmynd10 ortholog is highly
expressed in the transcriptome of developing chordotonal sensory
neurons, which have motile mechanosensory cilia. In adults, Zmynd10 was
exclusively expressed in the testes. Drosophila homozygous for a
loss-of-function Zmynd10 mutation showed uncoordinated locomotion due to
defective proprioception as a result of malfunctioning chordotonal
neurons. The mice were also infertile. Ultrastructural analysis of the
chordotonal neuron cilium from mutant flies showed that the inner and
outer dynein arms were reduced, although ciliogenesis appeared normal.
Sperm from mutant flies were immotile and sperm flagella showed a
partial loss of dynein arms, as well as axoneme splitting.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CILIARY DYSKINESIA, PRIMARY, 22
ZMYND10, VAL16GLY (dbSNP rs138815960)

In a patient with primary ciliary dyskinesia-22 (CILD22; 615444) and
situs inversus, Zariwala et al. (2013) identified a homozygous c.47T-G
transversion in exon 1 of the ZMYND10 gene, resulting in a val16-to-gly
(V16G) substitution at a conserved residue. Video microscopy of patient
respiratory cells showed immotile cilia, and electron microscopy showed
outer and inner dynein arm defects.

In 3 patients from 2 unrelated families of northern European descent
with CILD22, Moore et al. (2013) identified a homozygous V16G (dbSNP
rs138815960) substitution. The mutation, which was found by whole-exome
sequencing and confirmed by Sanger sequencing, segregated with the
disorder in the families. The V16G variant was present in 6 of 4,300
European control exomes from the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project Exome
Variant Server, corresponding to a frequency of 0.000698; the variant
was absent from 700 in-house control exomes. The clinical features were
available for 1 of the homozygous patients. She had recurrent
respiratory infections from birth, persistent rhinitis, recurrent otitis
media, and bronchiectasis. Light microscopy of respiratory epithelial
cells from this patient showed cilia with slowed frequency and stiff
beat, and electron microscopy showed reduced, but not absent, inner and
outer dynein arms. Two additional unrelated patients with CILD22 were
compound heterozygous for V16G and another pathogenic mutation in the
ZMYND10 gene (see, e.g., 607070.0006). Haplotype analysis suggested a
founder effect among these patients. Transfection of the corresponding
mutation (V14G) in Drosophila restored fertility in a mutant model, but
not as fully as transfection with the wildtype protein. The findings
suggested that the V16G allele may retain some function.

CILIARY DYSKINESIA, PRIMARY, 22
ZMYND10, 1-BP DEL, 300C

In a patient with CILD22 (615444), Zariwala et al. (2013) identified a
homozygous 1-bp deletion (c.300delC) in exon 3 of the ZMYND10 gene,
resulting in a frameshift and premature termination (Phe101SerfsTer38).
Video microscopy of patient respiratory cells showed immotile cilia, and
electron microscopy showed outer and inner dynein arm defects.

CILIARY DYSKINESIA, PRIMARY, 22
ZMYND10, 1-BP DUP, 486A

In a Turkish patient, born of consanguineous parents, with CILD22
(615444), Zariwala et al. (2013) identified a homozygous 1-bp
duplication (c.486dupA) in exon 5 in the ZMYND10 gene, resulting in a
frameshift and premature termination (Ser163IlefsTer20).
Immunofluorescence studies showed decreases in DNAH5 (603335) and DNALI1
(602135), and video microscopy of patient respiratory cells showed
immotile cilia.

.0004
CILIARY DYSKINESIA, PRIMARY, 22
ZMYND10, GLN323TER

In 2 unrelated patients of French and Hispanic origin, respectively,
with CILD22 (615444), Zariwala et al. (2013) identified a homozygous
c.967C-T transition in exon 9 of the ZMYND10 gene, resulting in a
gln323-to-ter (Q323X) substitution. Both patients had situs inversus and
defects of the outer and inner dynein arms on electron microscopy. Video
microscopy, which was done on 1 patient's respiratory cells, showed
immotile cilia.

.0005
CILIARY DYSKINESIA, PRIMARY, 22
ZMYND10, 2-BP DEL, 589TG

In a girl of northern European descent with CILD22 (615444), Moore et
al. (2013) identified compound heterozygous mutations in the ZMYND10
gene: a 2-bp deletion (c.589_590delTG), resulting in a frameshift and
premature termination (Val198GlyfsTer13), and V16G (607070.0001). The
patient had respiratory distress from birth, chronic cough, persistent
rhinosinusitis, bronchiectasis, otitis media, and dextrocardia. Light
microscopy of respiratory epithelial cells showed static cilia, and
electron microscopy showed absence of the inner and outer dynein arms.
The unaffected parents were heterozygous for 1 of the mutations. The
mutation was present at a frequency of less than 0.01 in the 1000
Genomes Project database and was not found in 700 in-house control
exomes.

.0006
CILIARY DYSKINESIA, PRIMARY, 22
ZMYND10, LEU266PRO

In 2 sibs of northern European descent with CILD22 (615444), Moore et
al. (2013) identified a homozygous c.797T-C transition in the ZMYND10
gene, resulting in a leu266-to-pro (L266P) substitution at a conserved
residue in an LxxLL motif. Both had recurrent respiratory infections,
ciliary motility defects, and absence of the inner and outer dynein arms
on electron microscopy. One had situs inversus. The mutation was present
at a frequency of less than 0.01 in the 1000 Genomes Project database
and was not found in 700 in-house control exomes. The unaffected parents
were heterozygous for the mutation.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The intake, export, and intracellular compartmentalization of copper is
strictly regulated. In S. cerevisiae, the CTR1, CTR2, and CTR3 genes
have been identified as copper uptake genes. By searching the expressed
sequence tag (EST) database with the deduced human CTR1 (COPT1; 603085)
protein sequence, Zhou and Gitschier (1997) identified ESTs encoding
COPT2, which they called CTR2. They obtained the full-length coding
sequences of CTR2 and an alternatively spliced transcript, which they
named CTR2X, by screening cDNA libraries. The predicted 143-amino acid
CTR2 protein has 3 transmembrane domains, lacks obvious metal-binding
motifs, and has a lower abundance of histidine and methionine residues
than does CTR1, suggesting to the authors that human CTR2 is analogous
to the yeast low-affinity copper uptake protein CTR2. Northern blot
analysis detected a 2-kb CTR2 transcript in all human tissues and organs
examined.

MAPPING

Zhou and Gitschier (1997) found that ESTs corresponding to the human
CTR2 gene had previously been mapped to 9q31-q32. By analysis of YAC
clones, they showed that CTR1 and CTR2 are not adjacent genes.

600845	TITLE *600845 PURINERGIC RECEPTOR P2X, LIGAND-GATED ION CHANNEL, 1; P2RX1
;;PURINOCEPTOR P2X1; P2X1;;
P2X RECEPTOR, SUBUNIT 1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Biologic responses to ATP, ADP, and other extracellular nucleotides are
mediated by P2-nucleotide receptors belonging to 2 major classes: G
protein-coupled P2Y receptors (see, e.g., P2RY1, 601167) and
nucleotide-gated ion channel P2X receptors. Multiple types of
P2-nucleotide receptors are expressed in platelets and blood cells
(Clifford et al., 1998).

CLONING

The rat P2X1 gene was cloned by Valera et al. (1994). By screening a
bladder library with the rat cDNA, Valera et al. (1995) isolated cDNAs
encoding human P2X1, or P2RX1. The sequence of the predicted 399-amino
acid human protein is 89% identical to that of the rat and mouse
homologs. Northern blot analysis revealed that P2X1 was expressed
predominantly as a 2.6-kb mRNA in various tissues. Additional 1.8-, 3.6-
and 4.2-kb mRNAs were detected in some tissues.

Sun et al. (1998) isolated platelet cDNAs corresponding to the 1.8-kb
P2RX1 transcript. Although the coding regions are identical, the
platelet transcript has a longer 5-prime untranslated region and a
truncated 3-prime untranslated region. Sun et al. (1998) suggested that
the different transcripts arise from alternative promoters or splicing.
On Western blots of extracts of mammalian cells expressing P2X1, the
protein had an apparent molecular mass of 70 kD, significantly higher
than the 45-kD mass predicted from the amino acid sequence. Sun et al.
(1998) stated that the difference may be due to glycosylation of the
extracellular domain.

GENE FUNCTION

By heterologous expression of human P2X1 in Xenopus oocytes, Valera et
al. (1995) showed that the receptor was sensitive to the purinergic
agonists ATP and alpha,beta-methylene ATP.

Sun et al. (1998) found that, when expressed in astrocytoma cells, the
P2X1 receptor exhibited both ATP- and ADP-stimulated calcium influx.

Electrophysiologic and biochemical studies indicated expression of the
P2X1 receptor in human and rat platelets, rat basophilic leukemia cells,
and phorbol myristate acetate-differentiated myeloid cells. Although
these findings suggested that P2X1 receptors are present in both blood
leukocytes and blood platelets, Clifford et al. (1998) found significant
expression of P2X1 receptors in human platelets, but not in mature
neutrophils, monocytes, or blood lymphocytes. Studies of
nucleotide-induced changes in Ca(2+) influx/mobilization demonstrated
that the platelet P2X1 receptors are pharmacologically distinct from the
well-characterized P2Y1 receptors. ATP was the most potent physiologic
nucleotide agonist for the P2X1 receptor, with ADP a full but less
potent agonist. In contrast, the P2Y1 receptor shows an absolute
selectivity for ADP as physiologic agonist and is antagonized by high
concentrations of extracellular ATP. These divergent selectivities
indicated that platelets may use ATP and ADP for distinct types of
regulation, and suggested a unique role for P2X1 receptors in hemostasis
or thrombosis.

Adrian et al. (2000) analyzed the expression of several purinergic
receptors during differentiation in a promyelocytic leukemia cell line.
Granulocytic differentiation was induced by dimethylsulfoxide, and a
monocytic/macrophage phenotype was induced by phorbol esters. No change
from the low basal expression of P2X1 was detected during granulocytic
differentiation, but expression was upregulated 10- to 14-fold at 36
hours of monocytic differentiation.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Valera et al. (1995) mapped the
P2X1 gene to 17p13.3.

Liang et al. (2001) mapped the mouse P2rx1 gene to a region of syntenic
homology on chromosome 11.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a girl with a severe bleeding disorder due to platelet defect (see
609821), Oury et al. (2000) identified a somatic heterozygous mutation
in the P2RX1 gene (600845.0001) in her platelets. However, Cattaneo
(2005) noted that the defect of ADP-induced platelet aggregation in the
patient reported by Oury et al. (2000) could not be explained by the
P2X1 receptor defect, since that receptor has no role in ADP-induced
platelet aggregation. Thus, the relationship between genotype and
phenotype in this patient is unclear.

ANIMAL MODEL

P2X1 receptors for ATP are ligand-gated cation channels, present on many
excitable cells including vas deferens smooth muscle cells. A
substantial component of the contractile response of the vas deferens to
sympathetic nerve stimulation, which propels sperm into the ejaculate,
is mediated through P2X receptors. Mulryan et al. (2000) demonstrated
that male fertility is reduced by approximately 90% in mice with a
targeted deletion of the P2X1 receptor gene. P2X1 -/- male mice
copulated normally. Reduced fertility resulted from a reduction of sperm
in the ejaculate and not from sperm dysfunction. Female and heterozygous
mice were unaffected. In P2X1-receptor-deficient mice, contraction of
the vas deferens to sympathetic nerve stimulation was reduced by up to
60%, and responses to P2X receptor agonists were abolished. Mulryan et
al. (2000) stated that P2X1 receptors are essential for normal male
reproductive function and suggested that the development of selective
P2X1 receptor antagonists may provide an effective nonhormonal male
contraceptive pill. In addition, agents that potentiate the actions of
ATP at P2X1 receptors may be useful in the treatment of male
infertility. P2X1 receptors are present on a variety of smooth muscle
preparations in addition to the vas deferens, including the urinary
bladder, arteries, and parts of the nervous system. There was no obvious
effect on the behavior of P2X1-receptor -/- mice, and heart rate and
bladder function appeared normal. There was, however, a small increase
in systolic blood pressure at rest in P2X1 -/- mice when compared to
their wildtype littermates.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
BLEEDING DISORDER DUE TO P2RX1 DEFECT, SOMATIC
P2RX1, 3-BP DEL, 1051CTG

In platelet cDNA isolated from a 6-year-old girl with a severe bleeding
disorder (see 609821), Oury et al. (2000) identified a somatic
heterozygous 3-bp deletion in the P2RX1 gene (1051delCTG), resulting in
the deletion of residue leu351 within a stretch of 4 leucine residues in
the second transmembrane-2 domain of the P2X1 receptor, which is
believed to be part of the ion-conducting region. The mutation was not
identified in cDNAs from the patient's reticulocytes or in the P2X1 gene
from patient neutrophil and mononuclear cells, suggesting a clonal
origin. Functional expression studies showed that the mutant P2X1
receptor had exhibited proper membrane localization, but formed a
nonfunctional channel. Coexpressed with wildtype P2RX1 showed that the
mutant protein exhibited a dose-dependent dominant-negative effect on
the normal ATP- or ADP-induced P2X1 channel activity. Clinically, the
patient presented at age 19 months with pronounced bleeding and was
hospitalized for severe exsanguination from a nosebleed. She continued
to have recurrent spontaneous generalized petechiae and ecchymoses.
Laboratory studies showed normal platelet count and size, but a
selective impairment of ADP-induced platelet aggregation. However,
Cattaneo (2005) noted that the defect of ADP-induced platelet
aggregation in the patient reported by Oury et al. (2000) could not be
explained by the P2X1 receptor defect, since that receptor has no role
in ADP-induced platelet aggregation. Thus, the relationship between
genotype and phenotype in this patient is unclear.

;;TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR 13-LIKE 1; TCF13L1;;
TRANSCRIPTIONAL ENHANCER FACTOR 1-RELATED GENE; RTEF1;;
TRANSCRIPTIONAL ENHANCER FACTOR 3; TEF3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Several gene products related to the transcription factor TEF1 (TCF13;
189967) have been identified. One of these, called RTEF1, binds to the
M-CAT regulatory element which directs muscle-specific gene expression.
Stewart et al. (1996) initially identified a human homolog of avian
RTEF1 in a random sequencing screen of a human colorectal cancer cDNA
library. They then cloned the full-length human RTEF1 gene from a human
heart cDNA library. Northern blot analysis revealed that RTEF1 is
expressed as 2-kb and 8-kb transcripts, with the highest level of
expression in skeletal muscle and lower levels in heart, placenta, and
kidney. The authors stated that the expression pattern appears to
correlate closely with that of TEF1. Hsu et al. (1996) used an mRNA
differential display method to identify FGF1-inducible genes in mouse
NIH-3T3 fibroblasts.

Jacquemin et al. (1996) cloned the mouse and human homologs of TEF3, a
member of the TEA/ATTS transcription factor family. They found that the
TEF3 gene encodes a polypeptide of 427 amino acids, which is 76%
identical to TEF1. Additionally, they observed that TEF3 can
noncooperatively bind the GT-IIC and Sph(I+II) enhansons of the SV40
enhancer. Jacquemin et al. (1996) determined by RT-PCR that human TEF3
is expressed in many human cell lines, and they determined by in situ
hybridization that tef3 is expressed almost exclusively in mouse embryo
skeletal muscle precursor cells.

MAPPING

Stewart et al. (1996) used fluorescence in situ hybridization to map
human RTEF1 to chromosome 12p13.3-p13.2. Hsu et al. (1996) mapped the
mouse homolog, which they designated Fr19, to the distal region of mouse
chromosome 6. The designation Fr19 referred to fibroblast growth factor
(FGF; 131220)-regulated.

608531	TITLE *608531 BTB/POZ DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 2; BTBD2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching sequence databases for homologs of BTBD1 (608530), followed
by 5-prime RACE of a fetal brain cDNA library, Carim-Todd et al. (2001)
cloned a partial BTBD2 cDNA. Both BTBD1 and BTBD2 contain N-terminal BTB
protein-protein interaction motifs. BTBD2 shares 95% amino acid
similarity with mouse Btbd2, as well as significant similarity with
partial rat and bovine orthologs. It shares 82% amino acid identity with
BTBD1.

Using the core domain of TOP1 (126420) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid
screen, Xu et al. (2002) cloned BTBD2 from a HeLa cell cDNA library.
However, like Carim-Todd et al. (2001), they were unable to clone the
5-prime end of the full-length transcript, probably due to the high GC
content at the 5-prime end. Northern blot analysis detected a 2.8-kb
BTBD2 transcript expressed more highly in skeletal muscle than in all
other tissues examined.

Xu et al. (2003) found that BTBD2 colocalized with BTBD1 in punctate or
elongated cytoplasmic bodies in all cell types tested. None of the
BTBD1/BTBD2 immunostaining colocalized with common organelle or
cytoskeleton marker proteins.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis and in vitro pull-down assays of deleted
BTBD2 peptides, Xu et al. (2002) determined that the last C-terminal 50
residues of BTBD2 interacted with TOP1; the BTB domain was not required
for this interaction. Recombinant BTBD2 slightly inhibited the supercoil
relaxation activity of TOP1 and produced a slight inhibition of TOP1
cleavage activity.

Xu et al. (2003) determined that at least part of the BTB domain of
BTBD2 was required for colocalization with coexpressed full-length BTBD1
or BTBD2, suggesting that homomeric or heteromeric interaction via the
BTB domain is required for colocalization to cytoplasmic bodies.
Endogenous BTBD1/BTBD2 appeared to assemble onto speckles containing
fluorescence-tagged TRIM5-delta (608487).

GENE STRUCTURE

Carim-Todd et al. (2001) determined that the BTBD2 gene contains at
least 9 exons and spans more than 27.7 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Carim-Todd et al. (2001) mapped the BTBD2
gene to chromosome 19p13.3.
