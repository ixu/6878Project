609267	TITLE *609267 MELANOMA ANTIGEN, FAMILY F, 1; MAGEF1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Stone et al. (2001) cloned MAGEF1 from an ovarian tumor cDNA library.
The deduced 308-amino acid protein contains a C-terminal MAGE motif and
shares extensive homology with the MAGE superfamily of tumor antigens
(e.g., MAGEA1; 300016). By EST database analysis, Stone et al. (2001)
identified MAGEF1 clones containing either 6 or 7 GGA trinucleotide
microsatellite repeats encoding glutamic acids. They also identified a
separate set of 2 GGAs encoding 2 glycine resides. The trinucleotide
repeats appeared to be unique to MAGEF1. Northern blot analysis detected
a 1.7-kb transcript in normal ovary and peripheral blood leukocytes and
in 6 of 7 ovarian tumors examined. RNA dot blot analysis detected MAGEF1
expression in all tissues examined.

GENE STRUCTURE

Stone et al. (2001) determined that a single exon contains the coding
region of the MAGEF1 gene.

MAPPING

By PCR of chromosome-specific DNA from rodent/human hybrid cell lines,
Stone et al. (2001) mapped the MAGEF1 gene to chromosome 3.

608041	TITLE *608041 ANTHRAX TOXIN RECEPTOR 2; ANTXR2
;;CAPILLARY MORPHOGENESIS GENE 2; CMG2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The ANTXR2 gene encodes a transmembrane protein in which the von
Willebrand A (vWA) domain binds to both lamin (see, e.g., LMNA, 150330)
and collagen IV (see, e.g., COL4A1, 120130), suggesting that this
protein plays a role in basement membrane matrix assembly and
endothelial cell morphogenesis. It also functions as a receptor for the
anthrax toxin (summary by Denadai et al., 2012).

CLONING

Using differential display and library screening to identify genes
upregulated during capillary morphogenesis, Bell et al. (2001) cloned
CMG2 from an umbilical vein endothelial cell cDNA library. The deduced
386-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 45 kD. CMG2
contains a potential N-terminal signal sequence, followed by a von
Willebrand factor (613160) type A (VWFA) domain and a central
transmembrane domain. RT-PCR of several adult and fetal tissues detected
expression only in placenta. Infection of fluorescence-tagged CMG2 with
an adenovirus vector revealed targeting of CMG2 to the endoplasmic
reticulum. CMG2 was also present within intracellular vesicles in some
cells.

Using an RT-PCR-based approach, Scobie et al. (2003) cloned full-length
CMG2 from placenta mRNA. The deduced protein contains 489 amino acids.
The VWFA domain of CMG2 shares 60% amino acid identity with the VWFA
domain of TEM8 (ANTXR1; 606410), and both proteins have a metal
ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) within their VWFA domain. Scobie et
al. (2003) determined that several isoforms of CMG2 are generated by
alternative splicing. A 488-amino acid isoform differs from the
489-amino acid form only in the final 12 C-terminal amino acids. The
489-amino acid CMG2 protein was expressed at the plasma membrane of
transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells. Northern blot analysis detected
transcripts of about 3.4, 3.9, and 5.1 kb. Expression of at least 1 CMG2
transcript was detected in heart, lung, liver, skeletal muscle,
peripheral blood leukocytes, placenta, small intestine, kidney, colon,
and spleen. No expression was detected in brain and thymus.

GENE FUNCTION

Bell et al. (2001) determined that CMG2 was 1 of several transcripts
upregulated by umbilical vein endothelial cells during capillary
morphogenesis in 3-dimensional collagen matrices. A bacterially
expressed recombinant VWFA domain of CMG2 bound collagen type IV (see
120130) and laminin (see 150320), but not other extracellular matrix
proteins.

Scobie et al. (2003) determined that the 489-amino acid CMG2 isoform,
like TEM8, functions as an anthrax toxin receptor. Following expression
in receptor-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cells, CMG2 bound the
protective antigen (PA) subunit of anthrax toxin and mediated toxin
internalization. Binding between the VWFA domain of CMG2 and PA was
direct and depended on divalent cations, with highest preference for
Ca(2+), followed by Mn(2+), Mg(2+), and Zn(2+). A soluble version of the
CMG2 VWFA domain inhibited intoxication of cells expressing endogenous
toxin receptors.

Rainey et al. (2005) found that the pH threshold for conversion of the
anthrax PA toxin prepore to pore and translocation of toxin from the
endosome to the cytosol differed by a pH unit depending on which
receptor was used. PA associated with the relatively low-affinity ANTXR1
receptor could proceed through these events at near neutral pH and
showed low sensitivity to ammonium chloride. In contrast, PA associated
with the high-affinity ANTXR2 receptor required more acidic conditions
to proceed through these events and could be inhibited by ammonium
chloride. Rainey et al. (2005) also found that PA dissociated from
ANTXR1 or ANTXR2 upon pore formation. They proposed that toxin can form
pores at different points in the endocytic pathway depending on which
receptor is used for entry.

Carette et al. (2009) used insertional mutagenesis to develop a
screening method to generate null alleles in a human cell line haploid
for all chromosomes except chromosome 8. Using this approach, they
identified genes encoding important elements of the biosynthetic pathway
of diphthamide, which are required for the cytotoxic effects of
diphtheria toxin and exotoxin A. Mutants in the known anthrax toxin
receptor ANTXR2 were recovered, as well as mutants in HB-EGF (126150),
the known diphtheria toxin receptor.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Bell et al. (2001) mapped the CMG2 gene to
chromosome 4q. The mapping of juvenile hyaline fibromatosis and
infantile systemic hyalinosis (hyaline fibromatosis syndrome; see
228600) to 4q21 and the demonstration of mutations in CMG2 in both of
these disorders (Hanks et al., 2003) indicated that the CMG2 gene is
located at 4q21.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Santelli et al. (2004) reported the crystal structure of the anthrax
protective antigen bound to CMG2 at 2.5-angstrom resolution. The
structure reveals an extensive receptor-pathogen interaction surface
mimicking the nonpathogenic recognition of the extracellular matrix by
integrins. The binding surface is closely conserved in the 2 receptors
across species, but is quite different in the integrin domains,
explaining the specificity of the interaction. CMG2 engages 2 domains of
the anthrax protective antigen. Modeling of the receptor-bound
protective antigen(63) heptamer suggested that the receptor acts as a
pH-sensitive brace to ensure accurate and timely membrane insertion.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In patients with variable age at onset of hyaline fibromatosis syndrome
(HFS; 228600), Hanks et al. (2003) identified homozygous or compound
heterozygous mutations in the ANTXR2 gene (608041.0001-608041.0002,
608041.0006-608041.0007). Preliminary genotype-phenotype analyses
suggested that abrogation of binding by the VWFA domain resulted in a
more severe disease, whereas in-frame mutations affecting a novel,
highly conserved cytoplasmic domain result in a milder phenotype. CMG2
is a transmembrane protein that is induced during capillary
morphogenesis and that binds laminin (156225) and collagen IV via a VWFA
domain. The findings implicated perturbation of basement membrane matrix
assembly as the cause of the characteristic perivascular hyaline
deposition seen in this disorder.

Using the 4q21 location for the gene mutant in HFS as a guide for
candidate gene identification, Dowling et al. (2003) identified and
characterized mutations in the CMG2 gene causing the disorder (see
608041.0003-608041.0005).

Deuquet et al. (2009) analyzed the cellular consequences of several
disease-associated mutations in the CMG2 gene, including mutations
affecting the von Willebrand factor ectodomain (G105D; 608041.0003 and
I189T; 608041.0006) and the transmembrane region (L329R; 608041.0004).
All these mutant proteins were retained intracellularly, with labeling
at the nuclear envelope and especially in the endoplasmic reticulum, in
contrast to the wildtype protein, which showed mainly plasma membrane
staining. Further studies showed decreased surface expression of these
mutant proteins (less than 20% to about 30% of normal). Results of
ligand-binding experiments with anthrax toxin showed that the mutants
were able to bind ligand effectively, but there was a partial to
complete loss of function in the cellular context due to varying degrees
of retention of the mutant proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum.
Deuquet et al. (2009) suggested that treatments based on chemical
chaperones could be beneficial.

In 2 sibs and 2 unrelated patients, all of Brazilian origin, with HFS,
Denadai et al. (2012) identified a truncating mutation in the ANTXR2
gene (1074delT; 608041.0008). All patients carried this mutation in
compound heterozygosity with another pathogenic ANTXR2 mutation (see,
e.g., 1073insC; 608041.0007). The 1074delT mutation had previously been
reported by El-Kamah et al. (2010) in the homozygous state in 3 Egyptian
sibs, born of consanguineous parents, who had a severe form of HFS
resulting in death in childhood in all patients.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HYALINE FIBROMATOSIS SYNDROME
ANTXR2, EX14DEL

In 2 seemingly unrelated families in India, Hanks et al. (2003) found
that juvenile-onset hyaline fibromatosis syndrome (HFS; 228600) was
related to homozygosity for a 1707G-A transition in the CMG2 gene, a
synonymous substitution that altered a consensus splice junction base,
resulting in an in-frame deletion of exon 14; 4q21 haplotype data were
consistent with this being a founder mutation in these 2 Indian
families.

Denadai et al. (2012) noted that Hanks et al. (2003) did not number
their mutations using the A of the ATG start codon of their ANTXR2
sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK091721) as nucleotide 1. The correct
numbering of this mutation, using the A of the ATG start codon of the
ANTXR2 reference sequence (GenBank GENBANK NM_058172.5) as nucleotide 1,
is 1179G-A.

.0002
HYALINE FIBROMATOSIS SYNDROME
ANTXR2, TYR381CYS

In 2 members of a Moroccan family with juvenile-onset hyaline
fibromatosis syndrome (228600), Hanks et al. (2003) found that the
disorder was associated with a 1670A-G transition in exon 14 of the CMG2
gene, resulting in a tyr381-to-cys (Y381C) substitution.

Denadai et al. (2012) noted that Hanks et al. (2003) did not number
their mutations using the A of the ATG start codon of their ANTXR2
sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK091721) as nucleotide 1. The correct
numbering of this mutation, using the A of the ATG start codon of the
ANTXR2 reference sequence (GenBank GENBANK NM_058172.5) as nucleotide 1,
is 1142A-G.

.0003
HYALINE FIBROMATOSIS SYNDROME
ANTXR2, GLY105ASP

In a Turkish patient with juvenile-onset hyaline fibromatosis syndrome
(228600) born to consanguineous parents, Dowling et al. (2003)
identified a homoallelic gly105-to-asp (G105D) mutation in the CMG2
gene, which destabilized a von Willebrand factor A extracellular domain
alpha helix.

.0004
HYALINE FIBROMATOSIS SYNDROME
ANTXR2, LEU329ARG

In an African American patient with juvenile-onset hyaline fibromatosis
syndrome (228600) from a consanguineous family, Dowling et al. (2003)
identified homozygosity for a leu329-to-arg (L329R) mutation in the
transmembrane domain of CMG2.

.0005
HYALINE FIBROMATOSIS SYNDROME
ANTXR2, GLU220TER

In a Turkish patient with infantile-onset hyaline fibromatosis syndrome
(228600) born to consanguineous parents, Dowling et al. (2003)
identified a truncating mutation in the CMG2 gene, glu220 to ter
(E220X).

.0006
HYALINE FIBROMATOSIS SYNDROME
ANTXR2, ILE189THR

In 2 sibs of Swiss origin, Hanks et al. (2003) found that
infantile-onset hyaline fibromatosis syndrome (228600) was related to
compound heterozygosity for a 1094T-C transition in exon 7 of the CMG2
gene, resulting in an ile189-to-thr (I189T) mutation, and a frameshift
1-bp insertion in the poly(C) tract in exon 13 (1601insC; 608041.0007).

Denadai et al. (2012) noted that Hanks et al. (2003) did not number
their mutations using the A of the ATG start codon of their ANTXR2
sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK091721) as nucleotide 1. The correct
numbering of this mutation, using the A of the ATG start codon of the
ANTXR2 reference sequence (GenBank GENBANK NM_058172.5) as nucleotide 1,
is 566T-C.

.0007
HYALINE FIBROMATOSIS SYNDROME
ANTXR2, 1-BP INS, 1073C

In a Hispanic individual living in the United States, Hanks et al.
(2003) found that infantile-onset hyaline fibromatosis syndrome (228600)
was related to homozygosity for insertion of a cytosine in the poly(C)
tract in exon 13 of the CMG2 gene. In 2 other families, each with 1
affected individual (1 of Puerto Rican/African American origin and 1 of
Chinese origin), Hanks et al. (2003) identified the 1601insC frameshift
mutation in heterozygous state; the other allele was not characterized
in these cases. The mutation appeared to have arisen independently in
these 3 families, because they carried different 4q21 haplotypes and
CMG2 polymorphisms. Moreover, 2 further families had different mutations
involving the poly(C) tract, which appears to be a mutation hotspot,
presumably owing to the repetitive sequence.

Denadai et al. (2012) noted that Hanks et al. (2003) did not number
their mutations using the A of the ATG start codon of their ANTXR2
sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK091721) as nucleotide 1. The correct
numbering of this mutation, using the A of the ATG start codon of the
ANTXR2 reference sequence (GenBank GENBANK NM_058172.5) as nucleotide 1,
is 1073insC.

.0008
HYALINE FIBROMATOSIS SYNDROME
ANTXR2, 1-BP DEL, 1074T

In 2 sibs and 2 unrelated patients, all of Brazilian origin, with
hyaline fibromatosis syndrome (228600), Denadai et al. (2012) identified
a 1-bp deletion (1074delT) in exon 13 of the ANTXR2 gene, resulting in a
frameshift and premature truncation (A359Hfs*50). All patients carried
this mutation in compound heterozygosity with another pathogenic ANTXR2
mutation (see, e.g., 1073insC; 608041.0007). The mutation had previously
been reported by El-Kamah et al. (2010) in the homozygous state in 3
Egyptian sibs, born of consanguineous parents, who had a severe form of
hyaline fibromatosis syndrome resulting in death in childhood in all
patients.

611542	TITLE *611542 ARYLSULFATASE B; ARSB
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The ARSB gene encodes arylsulfatase B (N-acetylgalactosamine
4-sulfatase; EC 3.1.6.12), a lysosomal enzyme that removes the C4
sulfate ester group from the N-acetylgalactosamine sugar residue at the
nonreducing terminus of the glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) dermatan sulfate
and chondroitin sulfate during lysosomal degradation (Karageorgos et
al., 2007).

CLONING

Schuchman et al. (1990) cloned a full-length ARSB cDNA from a human
testes cDNA library. The deduced 533-residue protein has 6 potential
N-glycosylation sites. Comparison of the predicted amino acid sequences
of arylsulfatases A (ARSA; 607574), B, and C (ARSC; 300747) demonstrated
regions of identity, particularly in their N termini.

Kunieda et al. (1995) isolated the rat Arsb gene.

GENE STRUCTURE

The ARSB gene contains 8 exons and spans about 206 kb (Karageorgos et
al., 2007).

MAPPING

Hellkuhl and Grzeschik (1978) assigned a gene for arylsulfatase B to
chromosome 5 by human-mouse somatic cell hybrids. By somatic cell
hybridization methods, DeLuca et al. (1979) assigned arylsulfatases A
and B to chromosomes 22 and 5, respectively. By study of an interstitial
deletion of 5q12, Dudin et al. (1984) excluded ARSB and HEXB from this
segment.

Fidzianska et al. (1984) assigned the ARSB locus to 5p11-qter by
analysis of somatic cell hybrids isolated from 2 separate fusions of
human fibroblasts carrying a translocation involving chromosome 5 with a
Chinese hamster cell line. By study of rearranged chromosomes in
human/hamster hybrids, using a tritium-labeled human genomic DNA
fragment for in situ hybridization, Fidzianska et al. (1986) narrowed
the assignment of ARSB to 5q11-q13.

Litjens et al. (1989) localized the ARSB gene to 5q13-q14.

By rat/mouse somatic cell hybridization, Kunieda et al. (1995) localized
the rat Arsb gene to chromosome 2.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a patient with mucopolysaccharidosis type VI (253200), Wicker et al.
(1991) identified a homozygous mutation in the ARSB gene (611542.0001).

In patients with MPS VI, Jin et al. (1992) identified homozygous or
compound heterozygous mutations in the ARSB gene
(611532.0002-611542.0004).

In 9 patients with MPS VI, Litjens et al. (1996) identified several
mutations in the ARSB gene (see, e.g., 611542.0008-611542.0010). All
patients were compound heterozygotes and showed variable phenotypes
ranging from mild to severe. For each patient, the combined biochemical
phenotypes of the 2 mutant sulfatase alleles demonstrated a good
correspondence with the observed clinical phenotype.

Litjens and Hopwood (2001) stated that a total of 45 clinically relevant
mutations had been identified in the ARSB gene in patients with
mucopolysaccharidosis type VI. Missense mutations represented the
largest group, with 31 identified. No common mutations had been
described, making screening of the general population difficult.

Karageorgos et al. (2007) identified 83 different ARSB mutations among
105 patients with MPS VI. The most frequent mutation was Y210C
(611542.0009), which was identified in 18% of patients and associated
with an attenuated phenotype.

Among 12 Spanish and 4 Argentinian patients with MPS VI, Garrido et al.
(2007) identified 19 different mutations, including 9 novel mutations,
in the ARSB gene. The most common mutant alleles were splice site
mutations, 611542.0011 and 611542.0012, which accounted for 21.9% and
12.5% of mutant alleles, respectively.

ANIMAL MODEL

Yoshida et al. (1993) reported the clinical, morphologic, and
biochemical features of a rat model of MPS VI. Affected rats had facial
dysmorphia, dysostosis multiplex, and increased urinary excretion of
glucosaminoglycans. Ultrastructural studies revealed storage of GAGs
throughout the reticuloendothelial cells, cartilage, and other
connective tissues, but no deposition was observed in the nervous
system. Biochemical analyses demonstrated that the excreted GAG was
dermatan sulfate and the activity of hepatic arylsulfatase B was less
than 5% of the normal mean value. Pedigree analysis showed that the
phenotype was inherited as an autosomal recessive single trait. Yoshida
et al. (1994) demonstrated that the responsible gene lies on rat
chromosome 2. It had been known that some loci on rat chromosome 2
correspond to those on human chromosome 5 and mouse chromosome 13.
Kunieda et al. (1995) demonstrated furthermore MPS VI in rats was due to
a homozygous 1-bp insertion (507insC) in the Arsb gene, resulting in a
frameshift and premature termination at codon 258.

Evers et al. (1996) produced a targeted disruption of the Arsb gene in
mice and found that homozygous mutant animals exhibited arylsulfatase B
enzyme deficiency and elevated urinary secretion of dermatan sulfate.
They developed progressive symptoms resembling those of MPS VI in
humans. Around 4 weeks of age, facial dysmorphism became overt, long
bones were shortened, and pelvic and costal abnormalities were observed.
Major alterations in bone formation with perturbed cartilaginous tissues
in newborns and widened, perturbed, and persisting growth plates in
adult animals were seen. All major parenchymal organs showed storage of
glycosaminoglycans preferentially in interstitial cells and macrophages.
Affected mice were fertile and mortality was not elevated up to 15
months of age.

McGovern et al. (1985) studied the mutant arylsulfatase B enzymes in
homozygotes for separately ascertained cat lines with MPS VI. They
showed that the enzymes were distinguishable in physicokinetic and
immunologic properties as well as in ability to dimerize with normal
enzyme in heterozygotes.

Yogalingam et al. (1996) studied the Arsb (feline f4S) gene in MPS VI
Siamese cats. They cloned the gene from a normal feline heart cDNA
library, sequenced it, and identified a missense mutation (leu476pro;
L476P) in the gene in MPS VI cats. Expression of the normal f4S gene,
accompanied by mannose-6-phosphate (M6P), corrected the lysosomal
storage of undegraded sulfated glycosaminoglycans in these cells. The
observation suggested that expression of the normal f4S gene in MPS VI
myoblasts is predominantly mediated by an M6P receptor (154540).

Crawley et al. (1996) used a feline model of MPS VI to investigate
enzyme replacement therapy. They evaluated tissue distribution and
clinical efficacy of 3 forms of recombinant human
N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfatase. Intravenously administered enzyme was
rapidly cleared from the circulation. The majority of the enzyme was
distributed to the liver but was also detected in most other tissues.
Tissue half-life was approximately 2-4 days. In 3 MPS VI cats, regular
intravenous infusions of recombinant enzyme for up to 20 months showed
variable reduction of storage vacuoles in Kupffer cells and connective
tissues; however, cartilage chondrocytes remained vacuolated. Vertebral
bone mineral volume was improved in 2 MPS VI cats in which therapy was
initiated before skeletal maturity, and increased bone volume appeared
to correlate with earlier age of onset of therapy. One cat showed
greater mobility in response to therapy. Crawley et al. (1996) suggested
that, given their results, significant reduction in disease progression
and tissue pathology might be expected in patients with this disorder.

Crawley et al. (1997) reported a dose-related response effect of enzyme
replacement therapy in MPS VI cats treated from birth. The evidence came
from clinical, biochemical, and histopathologic observations.

Crawley et al. (1998) stated that the family of cats with MPS VI used
for testing the efficacy of enzyme replacement therapy were homozygous
for the L476P substitution in the Arsb gene. An additional mutation,
asp520asn (D520N), inherited independently from L476P and identified in
the same family of cats, resulted in 3 clinical phenotypes: L476P
homozygotes exhibited dwarfism and facial dysmorphia due to epiphyseal
dysplasia, abnormal low leukocyte 4S/beta-hexosaminidase ratios,
dermatan sulfaturia, lysosomal inclusions in most tissues (including
chondrocytes), corneal clouding, degenerative joint disease, and
abnormal leukocyte inclusions. Similarly, D520N/D520N and L476P/D520N
cats had abnormally low leukocyte 4S/beta-hexosaminidase ratios, mild
dermatan sulfaturia, lysosomal inclusions in some chondrocytes, and
abnormal leukocyte inclusions; however, both had normal growth and
appearance. In addition, L476P/D520N cats had a high incidence of
degenerative joint disease. Crawley et al. (1998) concluded that
L476P/D520N cats have a very mild MPS VI phenotype not previously
described in MPS VI humans. Yogalingam et al. (1998), from the same
group, also reported biochemical and clinical assessment of L476P
homozygous, D520N/L476P compound heterozygous, and D520N homozygous
cats. They showed that the entire range of clinical phenotypes, from
severe MPS VI, to mild MPS VI, to normal were clustered within a narrow
range of residual 4S activity from 0.5 to 4.6% of normal levels. The
results suggested that the D520N mutation causes a rapid degradation of
4S protein. The effect of this is partially ameliorated as a result of a
significant elevation in the specific activity of mutant D520N 4S
reaching the lysosomes.

MUCOPOLYSACCHARIDOSIS TYPE VI, INTERMEDIATE
ARSB, GLY137VAL

In a patient with mucopolysaccharidosis type VI (253200), born of
consanguineous parents, Wicker et al. (1991) identified a homozygous
410G-T transversion in the ARSB gene, resulting in a gly137-to-val
(G137V) substitution. The mutation did not affect protein synthesis, but
severely reduced protein stability. The phenotype was of intermediate
severity.

.0002
MUCOPOLYSACCHARIDOSIS TYPE VI, SEVERE
ARSB, CYS117ARG

In a patient with severe MPS VI (253200), Jin et al. (1992) identified a
homozygous 349T-C transition in the ARSB gene, resulting in a
cys117-to-arg (C117R) substitution. The patient's cultured fibroblasts
showed about 2% of normal arylsulfatase B activity compared to a value
of about 7% in cultured fibroblasts from a patient with mild MPS VI
(L236P; 611542.0003).

.0003
MUCOPOLYSACCHARIDOSIS TYPE VI, MILD
ARSB, LEU236PRO

In a patient with mild MPS VI (253200), Jin et al. (1992) identified
compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the ARSB gene: a 707T-C
transition resulting in a leu236-to-pro (L236P) substitution, and a
1214G-A transition resulting in a cys405-to-tyr (C405Y; 611542.0004)
substitution. The patient's cultured fibroblasts showed about 7% of
normal arylsulfatase B activity compared to a value of about 2% in
cultured fibroblasts from a patient with severe MPS VI (C117R;
611542.0002).

MUCOPOLYSACCHARIDOSIS TYPE VI, SEVERE
ARSB, 1-BP DEL, 238G

In an 11-year-old boy with severe MPS VI (253200), Litjens et al. (1992)
identified a homozygous 1-bp deletion (238delG), resulting in a
frameshift and premature termination at codon 113. As an infant, he had
coarse dysmorphic features, advanced bone age, dysostosis multiplex, and
corneal clouding. Hydrocephalus required shunting at 4 years, and
cervical cord compression resulting from upper cervical instability
required surgical stabilization at 6 years of age.

.0006
MUCOPOLYSACCHARIDOSIS TYPE VI, SEVERE
ARSB, 1-BP DEL, 743C

In a child with a severe form of Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome (253200),
Isbrandt et al. (1996) identified compound heterozygosity for 2
deletions in the ARSB gene. One allele carried a 1-bp deletion (743delC)
in exon 4 resulting in a frameshift and premature termination. The
protein was predicted to be 221 amino acids, which is less than 42% of
the 533 amino acid wildtype enzyme. The second allele carried an 11-bp
deletion in exon 1 and a leu72-to-gln substitution (611542.0007). The
patient presented at 2.5 years with facial dysmorphism, scoliosis and
dysostosis multiplex, corneal clouding, hepatomegaly, and umbilical
hernia. At age 7 years, he had short stature, severe kyphoscoliosis,
restriction of joint movement, and pyramidal symptoms.

.0007
MUCOPOLYSACCHARIDOSIS TYPE VI, SEVERE
ARSB, 11-BP DEL AND LEU72GLN

In a child with severe Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome (253200), Isbrandt et al.
(1996) found a 1-bp deletion in the ARSB gene (611542.0006) and an 11-bp
deletion which resulted in premature termination and a shortened protein
predicted to be less than 23% of the length of the wildtype enzyme. In
addition to the 11-bp deletion, they observed a 215T-A transversion
resulting in a leu72-to-gln (L72Q) substitution on the same allele.

.0008
MUCOPOLYSACCHARIDOSIS TYPE VI
ARSB, ARG95GLN

In a patient with a severe form of MPS VI (253200), Litjens et al.
(1996) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the ARSB
gene: a 284G-A transition resulting in an arg95-to-gln (R95Q)
substitution, and H393P (611542.0010). She presented at age 13 months
with mild developmental delay, thoracolumbar kyphosis,
hepatosplenomegaly, and skeletal changes characteristic of the disorder.
In another family, 2 sibs with a mild form of MPS VI were compound
heterozygous for R95Q and Y210C (611542.0009). Functional expression
studies in CHO cells showed that the R95Q mutant retained about 0.02%
residual activity.

.0009
MUCOPOLYSACCHARIDOSIS TYPE VI
ARSB, TYR210CYS

In 2 sibs with a mild form of MPS VI (253200), Litjens et al. (1996)
identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the ARSB gene: a
629A-G transition resulting in a tyr210-to-cys (Y210C) substitution, and
R95Q (611542.0008). An additional unrelated patient with an intermediate
phenotype was compound heterozygous for Y210C and H393P (611542.0010).
Functional expression studies in CHO cells showed that the Y210C mutant
retained about 2% residual activity.

.0010
MUCOPOLYSACCHARIDOSIS TYPE VI
ARSB, HIS393PRO

In a patient with a severe form of MPS VI (253200), Litjens et al.
(1996) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the ARSB
gene: a 1178A-C transversion resulting in a his393-to-pro (H393P)
substitution, and R95Q (611542.0008) Functional expression studies in
CHO cells showed that the H393P mutant expressed no ARSB protein and
thus had no residual activity.

ARSB, IVS5AS, G-C,-1

Garrido et al. (2007) identified a G-to-C transversion in intron 5 of
the ARSB gene (1143-1G-C) in 21.9% of mutant alleles from 16 Spanish and
Argeninian patients with MPS VI (253200). RT-PCR analysis showed that
the mutation resulted in the skipping of exon 6 and premature
termination. Haplotype analysis indicated a founder effect.

the ARSB gene (1143-8T-G) in 12.5% of mutant alleles from 16 Spanish and
Argeninian patients with MPS VI (253200). RT-PCR analysis showed that
the mutation resulted in the skipping of exon 6 and premature
termination. Haplotype analysis indicated a founder effect.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Caspase-10 is an aspartate-specific cysteine protease of the ICE/CED3
(see 147678) family. These proteases take part in a cascade of reactions
thought to be responsible for the apoptotic changes observed in
mammalian cells undergoing programmed cell death.

CLONING

Fernandes-Alnemri et al. (1996) used degenerate PCR to identify CASP10,
a novel member of the ICE/CED3 protease family. They subsequently cloned
the cDNA, which they termed MCH4, from a human Jurkat T-cell cDNA
library. Sequence analysis revealed that MCH4 encodes a 479-amino acid
polypeptide. They found that MCH4 is most closely related to MCH5
(CASP8; 601763) and that MCH4 and MCH5 contain the active site
pentapeptide QACQG instead of the QACRG present in all other known
members of the family. Furthermore, the authors found that the sequences
of MCH4 and MCH5 contain Fas-associating protein with death domain
(FADD; 602457)-like domains, suggesting possible interaction with FADD.
Northern blot analysis showed that MCH4 was expressed as a 4-kb message
in most human tissues examined.

By searching an EST database for clones containing the conserved GSW
sequences found in the small catalytic subunit of caspases, Vincenz and
Dixit (1997) identified a cDNA encoding a splice variant of CASP10,
CASP10B, which they called FLICE2. Sequence analysis predicted that the
deduced 521-amino acid FLICE2 protein contains a 50-amino acid insert in
the C terminus of the prodomain and a 48-amino acid sequence distinct
from CASP10 at the C terminus. FLICE2 also contains 2 death effector
domains (DEDs). Northern blot analysis detected a 4.4-kb FLICE2
transcript particularly in tissues enriched in lymphoid cells and in the
K562 chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line.

GENE FUNCTION

Fernandes-Alnemri et al. (1996) stated that MCH4, like other members of
the ICE/CED3 family, forms an active protease only after cleavage of its
proenzyme into 2 subunits which dimerize to form the active enzyme. They
found that the mature enzyme cleaves both CPP32 (CASP3; 600636) and MCH3
(601761) proenzymes into their mature forms.

Functional analysis by Vincenz and Dixit (1997) showed that FLICE2
cleaves poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP; 173870) to its 85-kD
apoptotic form, binds FADD through the DEDs of each molecule, and binds
to the CD95 (TNFRSF6, or FAS; 134637) and TNFR1 (191190) death
receptors. The binding of CD95 and TNFR1 by FLICE2 is enhanced in the
presence of FADD. Overexpression of FLICE2, but not overexpression of an
active-site mutant, induced apoptosis.

Wang et al. (2001) showed that caspase-10 can function independently of
caspase-8 (CASP8; 601763) in initiating FAS- and tumor necrosis
factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand-receptor-mediated apoptosis.
Moreover, FAS crosslinking in primary human T cells leads to the
recruitment and activation of caspase-10. They showed that the
death-effector domains of caspases 8 and 10 interact with the
death-effector domain of FADD. Nonetheless, they found that caspases 8
and 10 may have different apoptosis substrates and therefore potentially
distinct roles in death receptor signaling or other cellular processes.

Lee et al. (2007) showed that intrinsic apoptosis in human cells that
was induced by the chemotherapeutic agent etoposide or the antibiotic
staurosporine, but not by FAS ligand (TNFSF6; 134638) or TRAIL (TNFSF10;
603598), caused translocation of AK2 (103020) from mitochondria to the
cytoplasm, followed by formation of a complex between AK2, FADD, and
CASP10. Yeast 2-hybrid analysis, protein pull-down assays, and
immunoprecipitation analysis showed that the N- and C-terminal domains
of AK2, which include nucleoside- and substrate-binding domains,
respectively, bound the C-terminal death domain of FADD. AK2 binding
promoted association of CASP10 with FADD, and addition of purified AK2
protein to cell extracts induced activation of CASP10 via FADD, leading
to subsequent activation of CASP9 (602234) and CASP3. Apoptosis through
the AK2 complex did not correlate with the adenylate kinase activity of
AK2, did not require CASP8-mediated apoptotic responses, and did not
involve mitochondrial cytochrome c release. Immunodepletion or knockdown
of AK2, FADD, or CASP10 abrogated etoposide-induced apoptosis, and AK2
complexes were not observed in several etoposide-resistant human tumor
cell lines that were deficient in expression of FADD, CASP10, or CASP3.
In contrast to the findings in human cells, etoposide-induced apoptosis
was observed in mouse embryonic fibroblasts that lacked Fadd expression.
Since mice also lack Casp10, Lee et al. (2007) concluded that mice lack
an apoptotic pathway comparable to the AK2-FADD-CASP10 pathway in
humans.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hadano et al. (2001) determined that the CASP10 gene contains 11 exons
and spans about 48 kb. It is transcribed in the centromere-to-telomere
direction.

MAPPING

Fernandes-Alnemri et al. (1996) mapped the MCH4 gene to 2q33-q34 by
FISH. Hadano et al. (2001) determined that the CFLAR (603599), CASP10,
and CASP8 genes are tandemly located within 200 kb.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Autoimmune Lymphoproliferative Syndrome type IIA

In an African American girl with type IIA autoimmune lymphoproliferative
syndrome (ALPS2A; 603909) characterized by abnormal lymphocyte and
dendritic cell homeostasis and immune regulatory defects, Wang et al.
(1999) identified a heterozygous mutation in the CASP10 gene (L285F;
601762.0001). The mutation resulted in decreased caspase activity and
interfered with death receptor-induced apoptosis, particularly that
stimulated by Fas ligand (134638) and TRAIL (603598). These results
provided evidence that inherited nonlethal caspase abnormalities cause
pleiotropic apoptosis defects underlying autoimmunity in ALPS2. A second
patient, of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, was reported to have a homozygous
substitution in the CASP10 gene (V410I), which was later determined to
be a polymorphism with apoptotic activity similar to the wildtype CASP10
protein (Gronbaek et al., 2000; Zhu et al., 2006). In addition, the
Ashkenazi Jewish patient was found to have a mutation in the TNFRSF1A
gene (191190), which is mutated in the TNF receptor-associated periodic
syndrome (TRAPS; 142680) (Zhu et al., 2006). Zhu et al. (2006) presented
association data suggesting that the V410I substitution may offer some
protection from severe disease in patients with ALPS1A (601859) who have
mutations in the TNFRSF6 gene (134637).

In 2 sisters and an unrelated boy with APLS2A, Zhu et al. (2006)
identified a heterozygous pathogenic mutation in the CASP10 gene (I406L;
601762.0007).

- Cancer

To explore the possibility that mutation in the CASP10 gene might be
involved in the development of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL; 605027), Shin
et al. (2002) analyzed the entire coding region and all splice sites of
the CASP10 gene for the detection of somatic mutations in 117 human
NHLs. Seventeen NHLs (14.5%) had CASP10 mutations, of which 3 were
identified in the coding regions of the prodomain, 11 in the p17 large
protease subunit, and 3 in the p12 small protease subunit. There were 2
frameshift mutations and 1 nonsense mutation; the remaining 14 were
missense mutations. Shin et al. (2002) expressed the tumor-derived
CASP10 mutants in 293 cells and found that apoptosis was suppressed.
These data suggested that the inactivating mutations of the CASP10 gene
may lead to the loss of its apoptotic function and contribute to the
pathogenesis of some human NHLs.

Park et al. (2002) analyzed the genetic alterations of the entire coding
region and all splice sites of the CASP8 and CASP10 genes in 99 gastric
cancers by PCR-SSCP and sequencing. Of the 99 gastric cancers, 3 had
CASP10 mutations, whereas no mutations were detected in CASP8. In vitro
expression studies showed that the met147-to-thr (M147T; 601762.0006)
and gln257-to-ter (Q257X; 601762.0004) mutants severely impaired
CASP10-mediated apoptosis. Park et al. (2002) suggested that somatic
alterations of the CASP10 gene may contribute to pathogenesis in a
subset of gastric cancers through loss of apoptotic function.

CASP10, LEU285PHE

In an African American patient with ALPS2A (603909), Wang et al. (1999)
identified a heterozygous 724C-T transition in the CASP10 gene,
resulting in a leu242-to-phe (L242F) substitution (L285F in the longer
CASP10 isoform). The proband's mother, who exhibited high levels of
autoantibodies to nuclear antigens and defective lymphocyte apoptosis,
also had the mutation. The proband's unaffected father and 2 sisters did
not have the mutation. The mutation was not found in 200 normal
chromosomes or in any patient with ALPS type I (601859).

Park et al. (2002) identified 3 somatic mutations in the CASP10 gene in
gastric cancers (137215): met147 to thr (M147T), and the previously
described gln257 to ter (Q257X; 601762.0004). By in vitro expression

AUTOIMMUNE LYMPHOPROLIFERATIVE SYNDROME, TYPE IIA
CASP10, ILE406LEU

In a 7-year-old boy with ALPS2A (603909), Zhu et al. (2006) identified a
heterozygous 1400A-T transversion in exon 9 of the CASP10 gene,
resulting in an ile406-to-leu (I406L) substitution near the active site
of the protein. Neither parent had a history suggestive of ALPS, but his
father, an adult-onset diabetic, also carried the mutation. The I406L
mutation was also identified in 2 sisters of mixed Jamaican and Guyanese
ancestry who had early-onset ALPS2A. Their mother and a third sister
were mutation carriers and asymptomatic at the time of evaluation, but
showed defective T cell apoptosis in vitro, increased numbers of
double-negative T cells, and positive direct antiglobulin IgG tests and
antithyroid antibodies. In vitro functional expression studies showed
that the I406L mutant protein had defective apoptosis and exerted a
dominant-negative effect when cotransfected with the wildtype protein.
The I406L substitution was not identified in 576 controls.

606592	TITLE *606592 VANIN 3; VNN3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By EST database analysis, Granjeaud et al. (1999) identified a novel
human VNN gene, VNN3. Martin et al. (2001) cloned a full-length VNN3
cDNA encoding a deduced 501-amino acid protein with strong similarity to
the mouse vnn3 molecule. Both the mouse and human proteins lack the
GPI-anchor motif found in VNN1 (603570) and VNN2 (603571). Northern blot
analysis detected a 1.8-kb VNN3 mRNA in human liver, placenta, and
peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs). A 3.8-kb mRNA was observed in PBLs.

GENE FUNCTION

Martin et al. (2001) found that all vanin proteins are ectoenzymes with
pantetheinase activity. They showed that mouse vanin-3 and, by analogy,
human VNN3 are secreted molecules.

GENE STRUCTURE

Martin et al. (2001) determined that the human VNN1, VNN2, and VNN3
genes, as well as the mouse vnn1 and vnn3 genes, all contain 7 exons.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Martin et al. (2001) mapped the VNN3 gene to human
chromosome 6q23-q24 and mouse chromosome 10 in a cluster with VNN1 and
VNN2. All 3 genes are aligned in the same transcriptional orientation.

601510	TITLE *601510 SREBP CLEAVAGE-ACTIVATING PROTEIN; SCAP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Studying the molecular defect in a class of sterol-resistant Chinese
hamster ovary (CHO) cells, Hua et al. (1996) found that the phenotype
was caused by a gain-of-function point mutation in a gene encoding a
novel membrane protein which they called SCAP (for 'SREBP
cleavage-activating protein'). The mutant SCAP activates cleavage of the
sterol regulatory element binding proteins (184756; 600481), and it
renders the reaction resistant to suppression by sterols. Although
wildtype SCAP can exert the same effect when overexpressed by
transfection, the mutant form is much more active. The mutation that
activates SCAP in the mutant CHO cells is a G-to-A transition that
changes codon 443 from aspartic acid to asparagine. The hamster SCAP
gene encodes a 1,276-amino acid polypeptide that is highly homologous to
C. elegans D2013.8 (Wilson et al., 1994) and to a human gene (GenBank
GENBANK D83782) designated KIAA0199 by Nagase et al. (1996). The deduced
1,277-amino acid protein contains G-beta repeats found in
beta-transducins. Northern blot analysis detected SCAP expression in all
tissues examined, with highest expression in kidney and ovary.

By PCR of KIAA0199 and 5-prime RACE of a human hepatoma cell line, Hua
et al. (1996) cloned full-length SCAP. They demonstrated that SCAP
contains multiple membrane-spanning segments, some of which show a
highly significant resemblance to the membrane-spanning segments of HMG
CoA reductase (142910), an enzyme whose degradation is regulated by
sterols. Hua et al. (1996) stated that SCAP appears to be a central
regulator of cholesterol metabolism in animal cells.

Nakajima et al. (1999) cloned a full-length human SCAP cDNA. The deduced
protein contains 8 transmembrane regions in the N terminus, followed by
a sterol-sensing domain and hydrophilic C-terminal domains containing 4
copies of the WD repeat.

GENE STRUCTURE

Nakajima et al. (1999) determined that the SCAP gene contains 23 exons
and spans over 30 kb. Exon 1 is noncoding. The 5-prime flanking region
is G/C rich and contains ADD1/SREBP1 binding sites in addition to SP1
(189906) and AP2 (107580) sites.

GENE FUNCTION

Cholesterol homeostasis in animal cells is achieved by regulated
cleavage of SREBPs, membrane-bound transcription factors. Proteolytic
release of the active domains of SREBPs from membranes requires a
sterol-sensing protein called SCAP, which forms a complex with SREBPs.
In sterol-depleted cells, DeBose-Boyd et al. (1999) found that SCAP
escorts SREBPs from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi, where
SREBPs are cleaved by site-1 protease (S1P; 603355). The authors showed
that sterols block this transport and abolish cleavage. Relocating
active S1P from Golgi to ER by treating cells with brefeldin A or by
fusing the ER retention signal KDEL to S1P obviated the SCAP requirement
and rendered cleavage insensitive to sterols. DeBose-Boyd et al. (1999)
concluded that transport-dependent proteolysis may be a common mechanism
to regulate the processing of membrane proteins.

Nohturfft et al. (2000) reported an in vitro system to measure
incorporation of SCAP into ER vesicles. When membranes were isolated
from sterol-depleted cells, SCAP entered vesicles in a reaction
requiring nucleoside triphosphates and cytosol. SCAP budding was
diminished in membranes from sterol-treated cells. Kinetics of induction
of budding in vitro matched kinetics of ER exit in living cells
expressing green fluorescent protein-SCAP. These data localized the
sterol-regulated step to budding of SCAP from ER and provided a system
for biochemical dissection.

Brown et al. (2002) showed that addition of cholesterol to ER membranes
in vitro caused a conformational change in SCAP, detected by the
unmasking of closely spaced trypsin cleavage sites. Two mutant forms of
SCAP (tyr298 to cys and asp443 to asn) that were refractory to sterol
regulation in vivo were also refractory to sterol-induced conformational
change in vitro. A potent regulator of SCAP in vivo,
25-hydroxycholesterol, failed to change the conformation of SCAP in
vitro, suggesting that oxysterols act in intact cells by translocating
cholesterol from plasma membrane to ER. These studies demonstrated an in
vitro effect of cholesterol on the sterol regulatory machinery.

Cao et al. (2002) identified a loss-of-function -11C-T promoter
polymorphism in the SCAP gene in 2 unrelated Caucasian subjects
ascertained on the basis of a biochemical diagnosis of combined
hyperlipidemia (144250). The mutation was absent from normolipidemic
subjects across 3 ethnic groups. The -11T allele was associated with a
marked reduction in promoter activity in a luciferase-based expression
system.

ANIMAL MODEL

In mice with a conditional SCAP deficiency in liver, Kuriyama et al.
(2005) observed that decreased fatty acid synthesis in the liver was
balanced by an equal increase in nonhepatic tissues, primarily adipose
tissue. This compensatory response was mediated by an insulin-dependent
increase in adipocyte SREBP1c (see 184756) and disappeared upon fasting.
Adipocytes showed insulin hypersensitivity, and plasma VLDL
triglycerides were dramatically reduced in these mice.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

By PCR and SSCP analysis of SCAP in 75 Caucasian individuals, Iwaki et
al. (1999) identified a common amino acid polymorphism of
isoleucine/valine at codon 796 in exon 16. The allelic frequencies were:
isoleucine (A) allele, 0.57, and valine (G) allele, 0.43.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1996) mapped the SCAP gene
to chromosome 3.

614758	TITLE *614758 DYNACTIN 4; DCTN4
;;DYN4;;
DYNACTIN, 62-KD SUBUNIT;;
p62
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

DCTN4 is a subunit of the 20S dynactin complex. The dynactin complex is
involved in microtubule-dependent vesicular transport, spindle assembly,
and cell division (summary by Karki et al., 2000).

CLONING

By gene dosage analysis and sequencing candidate genes in a YAC contig
covering the critical region of the 5q deletion syndrome (153550),
followed by database analysis, Boultwood et al. (2000) identified a
DCTN4 clone designated 605d01. Northern blot analysis detected a 7.5-kb
DCTN4 transcript in all 15 human tissues examined.

By mass spectrometric analysis of the 62-kD protein that affinity
purified with human dynactin, followed by EST database analysis and PCR
of an NT2 human teratocarcinoma cDNA library, Karki et al. (2000) cloned
DCTN4, which they called p62. The deduced 460-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 52.3 kD. It has an N-terminal domain with
11 cysteines, the last 8 of which fit the consensus sequence for a RING
domain predicted to bind 2 Zn(2+) atoms. Northern blot analysis detected
variable expression of an approximately 4.2-kb transcript in all tissues
examined, with highest expression in heart and skeletal muscle.
Immunocytochemical analysis revealed that p62 had a punctate cytoplasmic
distribution as well as a centrosomal distribution typical of dynactin.

By immunohistochemical analysis, Ayalon et al. (2008) showed that Dyn4
colocalized with other dynactin subunits in adult mouse muscle fibers.
Dyn4 localized in a punctate distribution along costamere lines.

GENE FUNCTION

Karki et al. (2000) stated that p62 is present in the dynactin complex
at a stoichiometry of 1 copy per complex and that it localizes at 1 end
of the central ARP1 (ACTR1A; 605143) polymeric filament. Using
biochemical and immunoprecipitation analyses, they showed that p62
associated with the rat 20S dynactin complex. Recombinant human p62
bound immobilized in vitro-translated human ARP1. Overexpression of p62
in PtK2 porcine kidney cells did not disrupt microtubule organization or
the integrity of the Golgi, but it resulted in some p62 nuclear
localization.

ATP7B (606882) localizes to the trans-Golgi network, where it transports
copper to apoceruloplasmin (CP; 117700). When copper levels are in
excess, ATP7B redistributes to a vesicular compartment near the biliary
canalicular membranes, where excess copper is eliminated into bile.
Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a human liver cDNA library, Lim et al.
(2006) found that the N-terminal domain of ATP7B, which contains 6
N-terminal metal-binding sites, interacted with the C-terminal domain of
p62. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis revealed that ATP7B, but not ATP7A
(300011), interacted with endogenous p62 in a human fibroblast line.
Depletion of copper reduced interaction of ATP7B with p62. Mutation
analysis revealed that the metal-binding CxxC motifs of ATP7B were
required for its interaction with p62, predominantly CxxC motifs 4
through 6. Lim et al. (2006) concluded that ATP7B is transported along
liver cell microtubules in a copper-dependent manner via interaction
with p62.

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis of a mouse heart cDNA library, Ayalon et al.
(2008) found that Ankb (ANK2; 106410) interacted with Dyn4. Protein
pull-down assays confirmed the interaction. Depletion of Ankb in adult
mouse skeletal muscle fibers disrupted costamere-associated
microtubules, concomitant with loss of costamere-associated Dyn4
expression.

MAPPING

By database and YAC contig analyses, Boultwood et al. (2000) mapped the
DCTN4 gene to chromosome 5q31-q32.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Emond et al. (2012) used exome sequencing and an extreme phenotype study
design to discover genetic variants influencing Pseudomonas aeruginosa
infection in cystic fibrosis. Forty-three individuals with early age of
onset of chronic P. aeruginosa infection (all below the tenth percentile
of age at onset), and the 48 oldest individuals who had not reached
chronic P. aeruginosa infection (all past the mean age of onset) were
sequenced. After Bonferroni adjustment, a single gene, DCTN4, was
significantly associated with time to chronic P. aeruginosa infection
(naive P = 2.2 x 10(-6); adjusted P = 0.025). Twelve of the 43
individuals in the early extreme sample carried a missense variant in
DCTN4, 9 a phe349-to-leu substitution (F349L; dbSNP rs11954652) and 3 a
tyr270-to-cys substitution (Y270C; dbSNP rs35772018). None of the 48
individuals in the late P. aeruginosa extreme sample had either missense
variant. Subsequently, 696 individuals with varied CFTR genotypes were
studied. Seventy-eight participants were heterozygous and 9 were
homozygous for the F349L (614758.0001) mutation; 15 were heterozygous
for the Y270C (614758.0002) mutation; 1 individual was heterozygous for
both mutations. The presence of at least 1 DCTN4 missense variant was
significantly associated with both early age of first P.
aeruginosa-positive culture (p = 0.01, hazard ratio = 1.4) and with
early age of onset of chronic P. aeruginosa infection (p = 0.004, hazard
ratio = 1.9). The risk was highest in individuals with less selective
bias toward a P. aeruginosa-negative history, i.e., children enrolled
before 1.5 years of age and 103 enrollees who participated in the study
despite a history of P. aeruginosa-positive cultures. No significant
interaction was found between CFTR genotypes and DCTN4 mutations,
although power to detect such an interaction was low.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

HIF is a transcriptional complex that plays a central role in mammalian
oxygen homeostasis. Posttranslational modification by prolyl
hydroxylation is a key regulatory event that targets HIF (see HIF1A,
603348) subunits for proteasomal destruction via the von Hippel-Lindau
(VHL; 608537) ubiquitylation complex. Epstein et al. (2001) defined a
conserved HIF-VHL-prolyl hydroxylase pathway in C. elegans and
identified Egl9 as a dioxygenase that regulates HIF by prolyl
hydroxylation. In mammalian cells, they showed that the HIF-prolyl
hydroxylases are represented by 3 proteins with a conserved
2-histidine-1-carboxylate iron coordination motif at the catalytic site.
The genes encoding these proteins were cloned and termed PHD1 (606424),
PHD2, and PHD3 (606426) by the authors. Direct modulation of recombinant
enzyme activity by graded hypoxia, iron chelation, and cobaltous ions
mirrored the characteristics of HIF induction in vivo, fulfilling
requirements for these enzymes being oxygen sensors that regulate HIF.

By restriction enzyme screening of a YAC clone spanning the 1q42.1
translocation breakpoint associated with major psychosis for CpG
island-rich sequences, Dupuy et al. (2000) identified a cDNA encoding
EGLN1, which they termed C1ORF12. The predicted 426-amino acid EGLN1
protein is 87% identical to the rat SM20 protein and contains 2 nuclear
localization signals.

Bruick and McKnight (2001) independently identified the conserved family
of HIF prolyl hydroxylase enzymes, which they called HPH1, 2, and 3,
respectively, that appear to be responsible for the posttranslational
modification of HIF that targets it for ubiquitination.

By quantitative RT-PCR of 17 human tissues, Oehme et al. (2002) found
that EGLN1 expression was high in adipose tissue, moderate in heart, and
low in brain, small intestine, kidney, thymus, testis, adrenal gland,
pancreas, and uterus. No expression was detected in other tissues.

Independently, Hirsila et al. (2003) cloned HIFP4H1, HIFP4H2, and
HIFP4H3 by PCR of human colon, aorta, and lung cDNA. They identified
HIFP4H2 splice variants lacking exons 3 or 4. Skipping of exon 3 was
expected to result in an inactive protein due to the loss of key
catalytic residues. Skipping of exon 4 changes the C-terminal tail, but
it does not alter the catalytic site. PCR analysis revealed HIFP4H2
expression in all tissues examined, with highest expression in adult
heart, brain, lung, and liver and in fetal brain, heart, spleen, and
skeletal muscle. The splice variants showed weaker expression that
full-length HIFP4H2 in all tissues examined.

GENE FUNCTION

In cultured mammalian cells, Bruick and McKnight (2001) found that the
inappropriate accumulation of HIF caused by forced expression of the
HIF1A subunit under normoxic conditions was attenuated by coexpression
of HPH. Suppression of HPH in cultured Drosophila melanogaster cells by
RNA interference resulted in elevated expression of the
hypoxia-inducible gene LDH (see 150000) under normoxic conditions.
Bruick and McKnight (2001) concluded that HPH is an essential component
of the pathway through which cells sense oxygen.

Using recombinant proteins expressed in insect cells, Hirsila et al.
(2003) found that HIFP4H1, HIFP4H2, and HIFP4H3 showed in vitro
2-oxoglutarate-dependent hydroxylation of a 19-residue peptide
corresponding to the C-terminal prolyl hydroxylation site of HIF1-alpha.
The protein encoded by the HIFP4H2 variant lacking exon 4 was inactive
in this assay. All 3 full-length enzymes showed lower or no activity
against a peptide corresponding to a more N-terminal putative prolyl
hydroxylation site in HIF1-alpha. All 3 enzymes hydroxylated peptides
designed from putative prolyl hydroxylation sites of human HIF2-alpha
(EPAS1; 603349), HIF3-alpha (HIF3A; 609976), and C. elegans HIF-alpha.
The isoform encoded by the short HIFP4H3 splice variant was inactive.

Ozer et al. (2005) found that ING4 (608524) suppressed expression of HIF
target genes under hypoxic conditions. ING4 directly interacted with
HPH2, a mediator of HIF stability, providing a mechanism for ING4
recruitment to HIF. ING4 association with HPH2 did not affect
hydroxylase activity or HIF stability, but it suppressed HIF activity in
a chromatin-dependent manner. Ozer et al. (2005) hypothesized that ING4,
recruited to HIF by HPH2 under hypoxic conditions, acts as an adaptor
protein to recruit transcriptional repressors to mediate HIF activity.

Minamishima and Kaelin (2010) showed that loss of all 3 PHDs (PHD1,
606424; PHD2; and PHD3, 606426) in the liver dramatically increased EPO
(133170) and hematocrit values to concentrations vastly in excess of
those achieved after renal PHD2 inactivation. Minamishima and Kaelin
(2010) found that PHD2 inactivation is sufficient to induce near maximal
renal EPO production, whereas inactivation of all 3 PHDs is needed to
reactivate hepatic EPO production.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hirsila et al. (2003) determined that the EGLN1 gene contains 4 coding
exons.

MAPPING

Using YAC and genomic sequence analysis and FISH, Dupuy et al. (2000)
mapped the EGLN1 gene to chromosome 1q42-q43, centromeric to the
breakpoint associated with major psychosis.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a father, son, and daughter with familial erythrocytosis-3 (ECYT3;
609820), Percy et al. (2006) identified a heterozygous mutation in the
EGLN1 gene (606425.0001). The mutant protein showed dramatically
decreased hydroxylase activity towards both HIF1-alpha and HIF2-alpha
(603349). The findings provided evidence that EGLN1 plays a critical
role in regulating HIF levels in EPO-producing cells in humans.

Percy et al. (2007) identified a second heterozygous mutation in the
EGLN1 gene (606425.0002) in a patient with modest erythrocytosis and
inappropriately normal EPO levels.

ANIMAL MODEL

Mazzone et al. (2009) found that Phd2 -/- mice died at midgestation,
while Phd2 +/- mice were healthy and displayed normal angiogenesis.
Vessels formed in tumors often appear abnormal and function
inefficiently. Tumors with abnormal angiogenesis developed in wildtype
mice injected with several types of cancer cell lines; however, tumors
grown in Phd2 +/- mice appeared normal and showed improved oxygenation.
Phd2 haploinsufficiency also limited tumor metastasis.

Takeda et al. (2011) found that haplodeficient Phd2 mice displayed
preformed collateral arteries that preserved limb perfusion and
prevented tissue necrosis in ischemia. Improved arteriogenesis in Phd2
heterozygous mice was due to an expansion of tissue-resident, M2-like
macrophages and their increased release of arteriogenic factors, leading
to enhanced smooth muscle cell recruitment and growth. Both chronic and
acute deletion of one Phd2 allele in macrophages was sufficient to skew
their polarization towards a proarteriogenic phenotype. Mechanistically,
collateral vessel preconditioning relied on the activation of the
canonical NF-kappa-B (see 164011) pathway in Phd2 heterozygous
macrophages.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
ERYTHROCYTOSIS, FAMILIAL, 3
EGLN1, PRO317ARG

In a father, son, and daughter with familial erythrocytosis-3 (609820),
Percy et al. (2006) identified a heterozygous 950C-G transversion in the
EGLN1 gene, resulting in a pro317-to-arg (P317R) substitution in a
highly conserved region of the protein. In vitro functional expression
studies showed that the mutant protein had markedly decreased enzyme
activity. The mutation was not identified in 200 control samples.
Erythropoietin (133170) levels in the son and daughter were
inappropriately normal, suggesting dysregulation of the EPO axis.

.0002
ERYTHROCYTOSIS, FAMILIAL, 3
EGLN1, ARG371HIS

In a patient with erythrocytosis-3 (609820), Percy et al. (2007)
identified a heterozygous 1112G-A transition in the EGLN1 gene,
resulting in an arg371-to-his (R371H) substitution, 3 residues away from
an iron-chelating residue. In vitro functional expression studies showed
that the mutant protein had decreased binding to HIF2A (603349) and
HIF1A (603348), and showed decreased prolyl hydroxylase activity
compared to wildtype EGLN1. The patient had modest erythrocytosis with
inappropriately normal EPO levels.

.0003
ERYTHROCYTOSIS, FAMILIAL, 3
EGLN1, HIS374ARG

In a man with erythrocytosis-3 (609820), Ladroue et al. (2008)
identified a heterozygous 1121A-G transition in the EGLN1 gene,
resulting in a his374-to-arg (H374R) substitution in a highly conserved
residue that is important for binding of Fe(2+). In vitro functional
expression studies showed that the H374R mutant protein was unable to
suppress HIF-alpha subunits (see, e.g., HIF1A; 603348), indicating
impaired activity. The patient also had a recurrent paraaortic
paraganglioma associated with hypertension. Examination of tumor tissue
showed the H374R mutation and loss-of-heterozygosity for the wildtype
EGLN1 allele. The findings suggested that EGLN1 may also act as a
tumor-suppressor gene. Ladroue et al. (2008) noted that hereditary
paraganglioma syndromes (see, e.g., PGL1; 168000) can be caused by
mutations in genes encoding succinate dehydrogenase (see, e.g., SDHD;
602690), which result in accumulation of succinate and inhibition of PHD
function with overexpression of HIF. The authors suggested that
alteration of the ELGN1/HIF pathway could contribute to the growth of a
paraganglioma.

;;LYSOPHOSPHATIDIC ACID ACYLTRANSFERASE-BETA;;
LPAAT-BETA
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a phospholipid with diverse biologic
activities. LPA acyltransferase (LPAAT), or
1-acyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.51),
catalyzes the conversion of LPA to PA. By searching an EST database for
human homologs of yeast LPAAT, West et al. (1997) identified cDNAs
encoding 2 proteins which they designated LPAAT-alpha (603099) and
LPAAT-beta. The predicted LPAAT-beta protein is 278 amino acids long.
Overall, the sequences of the 2 human proteins are 12% identical to the
sequence of yeast LPAAT. Northern blot analysis revealed that, unlike
LPAAT-alpha, LPAAT-beta is expressed in a distinct tissue-specific
pattern, with the highest levels of expression observed in liver and
heart. West et al. (1997) demonstrated that both human LPAATs
complemented an E. coli LPAAT mutation. Overexpression of the human
LPAATs in mammalian cell lines led to increased enzyme activity. This
increase in activity correlated with enhanced transcription and
synthesis of IL6 (147620) and TNF-alpha (191160), suggesting that LPAAT
overexpression may amplify the cellular response to cytokine
stimulation.

Lu et al. (2005) cloned mouse Agpat2. The deduced 278-amino acid protein
has a putative N-terminal signal sequence and 3 transmembrane domains.
It contains catalytic and substrate-binding motifs and a third motif
conserved among AGPAT family members. Mouse and human AGPAT2 share 76%
amino acid identity. RT-PCR analysis of mouse tissues detected highest
expression in liver, followed by kidney, gut, skeletal muscle, and
heart. All other tissues showed little to no expression.

GENE FUNCTION

Using RT-PCR, Lu et al. (2005) found that activation of Ppar-alpha
(170998) in mouse heart elevated Agpat2 expression.

GENE STRUCTURE

Eberhardt et al. (1997) reported that the LPAAT-beta gene contains 6
exons and spans less than 20 kb.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Eberhardt et al. (1997) mapped
the LPAAT-beta gene to 9q34.3. Aguado and Campbell (1998) observed that
the LPAAT-alpha gene is located at 6p21, making the LPAAT genes another
example of 2 members of a gene family being found at 9q34 and 6p21. The
authors suggested that the 2 chromosomal regions arose from duplication
of an ancestral chromosomal segment.

Lu et al. (2005) mapped the mouse Agpat2 gene to chromosome 2.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of 11 pedigrees with autosomal recessive
Berardinelli-Seip congenital lipodystrophy showing linkage to 9q34
(BSCL1; 608594), Agarwal et al. (2002) identified 11 mutations in the
AGPAT2 gene (see, e.g., 603100.0001-603100.0005). All affected members
carried homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations. The AGPAT2 enzyme
catalyzes an essential reaction in the biosynthetic pathway of
glycerophospholipids and triacylglycerol. Agarwal et al. (2002)
suggested that the AGPAT2 enzyme is likely to affect triacylglycerol
synthesis in adipose tissue, and that mutations may cause lipodystrophy
by resulting in triglyceride-depleted adipocytes.

Fu et al. (2004) screened for mutations in AGPAT2 and BSCL2 (606158) in
27 families with congenital generalized lipodystrophy. They found
mutations in either AGPAT2 or BSCL2 in all but 4 probands, including 3
novel mutations in AGPAT2, lys215 to ter (603100.0006), IVS3-1G-C
(603100.0007), and phe189 to ter (603100.0008). In 3 sibs with
congenital generalized lipodystrophy and cystic angiomatosis of long
bones (a phenotypic variant known as Brunzell syndrome), they identified
a splice site mutation in AGPAT2 (IVS4-2A-G; 603100.0002). Fu et al.
(2004) concluded that there did not appear to be any distinguishing
clinical characteristics between subjects with congenital generalized
lipodystrophy with AGPAT2 or BSCL2 mutations with the exception of
mental retardation in carriers of BSCL2.

In affected sibs from 2 unrelated families segregating Berardinelli-Seip
congenital lipodystrophy-1 (608594), one from Turkey and the other from
Belgium, Agarwal et al. (2002) found a 202C-T transition in the AGPAT2
gene in homozygous state, leading to an arg68-to-ter (R68X) amino acid
change. In one family the 2 sibs were 50 and 53 years old; in the other,
the 2 sibs were 15 and 17 years old.

LIPODYSTROPHY, CONGENITAL GENERALIZED, TYPE 1
AGPAT2, IVS4AS, A-G, -2

In affected members of 5 families of African descent with
Berardinelli-Seip congenital lipodystrophy-1 (608594), Agarwal et al.
(2002) found either homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for a splice
site mutation in the AGPAT2 gene (IVS4-2A-G) resulting in a frameshift
and a premature termination at codon 228 (gln196fsX228). In 2 African
American families living in the U.S., the mutation was present in
homozygous state. In another U.S. African American family, it was
present in compound heterozygous state with a 1-bp insertion, 377insT,
causing a frameshift, leu126fsX146 (603100.0003). In a Caribbean family
living in the U.K., it was found in compound heterozygous state with a
missense mutation, leu228 to pro (603100.0004). In an African Caribbean
family living in Trinidad, it was present in compound heterozygous state
with a 3-bp deletion, 418delTTC (603100.0005), resulting in loss of
phenylalanine-140. The 4 homozygous individuals in 2 families varied in
age from 23 to 37 years. Agarwal et al. (2002) found that the splice
site mutation in the 5 families of African origin was on an allele that
had the same haplotype for 7 markers extending 33 kb, suggesting a
common ancestral mutation.

Fu et al. (2004) found this mutation in an African American female with
congenital generalized lipodystrophy and in 3 African American sibs with
cystic angiomatosis of the long bones (a phenotype designated Brunzell
syndrome; see 608594). In the African American sibship, the 2 females
had primary amenorrhea.

In a U.S. African American family, Agarwal et al. (2002) found that 2
individuals, aged 29 and 31 years, with congenital generalized
lipodystrophy-1 (608594) were compound heterozygotes for the AGPAT2
IVS4-2A-G splice site mutation (603100.0002) and a 1-bp deletion,
377insT, which caused a frameshift mutation beginning with leu126 and
ending with premature termination at codon 146.

AGPAT2, LEU228PRO

In an African Caribbean family living in the U.K., Agarwal et al. (2002)
found that affected members with congenital generalized lipodystrophy-1
(608594) were compound heterozygotes for mutations of the AGPAT2 gene:
the IVS4 acceptor splice mutation (603100.0002) and a missense mutation,
leu228 to pro (L228P), resulting from a 683T-C transition. The affected
individuals were 13 and 15 years old.

AGPAT2, 3-BP DEL, 418TTC

In an African Caribbean family from Trinidad with congenital generalized
lipodystrophy-1 (608594), Agarwal et al. (2002) found that 1 affected
individual, a 3-year-old female, was a compound heterozygote for the
AGPAT2 intron 4 acceptor splice site mutation (603100.0002) and a 3-bp
deletion, 418delTTC, causing deletion of phenylalanine at codon 140.

.0006
LIPODYSTROPHY, CONGENITAL GENERALIZED, TYPE 1
AGPAT2, LYS215TER

In 2 female sibs from an African American family with congenital
generalized lipodystrophy-1 (608594), Fu et al. (2004) found
homozygosity for an A-to-T transversion at nucleotide 712 in exon 5 of

LIPODYSTROPHY, CONGENITAL GENERALIZED, TYPE 1
AGPAT2, IVS3, A-G, -1

In an individual from Brazil of African descent with congenital
generalized lipodystrophy-1 (608594) Fu et al. (2004) found compound
heterozygosity for mutations in the AGPAT2 gene. One allele carried a
splice site mutation (IVS3-1G-C); the other carried a premature
termination mutation (603100.0008). The IVS3-1G-C mutation predicted
frameshift and premature termination (asn164fsX249).

LIPODYSTROPHY, CONGENITAL GENERALIZED, TYPE 1
AGPAT2, PHE189TER

Fu et al. (2004) found that 1 AGPAT2 allele of a Brazilian individual
with congenital generalized lipodystrophy-1 (608594) contained a C-to-A
transversion at nucleotide 636 in exon 4 that resulted in a premature
termination at phe189 (F189X). The other allele carried a splice site
mutation (603100.0007).

LIPODYSTROPHY, CONGENITAL GENERALIZED, TYPE 1
AGPAT2, 1,036-BP DEL

In all 10 affected members from 2 families with congenital generalized
lipodystrophy-1 (608594) from southeastern Brazil, Gomes et al. (2004)
identified homozygosity for a 1.036-bp deletion encompassing nucleotide
50 of exon 3 to nucleotide 534 within intron 4 of the AGPAT2 gene,
resulting in the skipping of exons 3 and 4 and inducing the deletion of
nucleotides 317-588. The mutation causes a frameshift and premature
termination codon, gly106fsX188. Gomes et al. (2004) noted that this
mutation had previously been described in a large consanguineous
pedigree from Portugal by Agarwal et al. (2002).

114182	TITLE *114182 CALMODULIN 2; CALM2
;;PHKD2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Sen Gupta et al. (1987) first identified and cloned the second
calmodulin gene. Fischer et al. (1988) noted that, although the CALM1
(114180), CALM2, and CALM3 (114183) proteins are identical, at the
nucleotide level they share only about 80% identity within their coding
regions, and they contain no significant homology within their noncoding
regions.

Using a sequence from CALM3 as probe, Toutenhoofd et al. (1998) cloned
CALM2 from a small intestine mucosa cDNA library. Northern blot analysis
revealed a major 1.4-kb transcript in all tissues tested, with highest
expression in brain. High levels of expression were also found in heart,
placenta, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, and kidney, with lowest levels
found in pancreas.

GENE STRUCTURE

Toutenhoofd et al. (1998) determined that the CALM2 gene contains 6
exons and spans more than 16 kb. Within the 5-prime flanking region,
CALM2 contains a TATA-like sequence, a far upstream CCAAT box, several
AP1 (165160)-, AP2 (see 107580)-, and CRE (see 123811)-binding sites,
and a repeated AGGGA motif that is found in other CALM genes.

MAPPING

McPherson et al. (1991) tentatively assigned the CALM2 gene to
chromosome 10 by study of somatic cell hybrids. However, by PCR-based
amplification of CALM2-specific sequences using DNA from human/hamster
cell hybrids as template, Berchtold et al. (1993) found that the CALM2
gene is located on chromosome 2. They regionalized the gene to
2p21.3-p21.1 by in situ hybridization.

600006	TITLE *600006 REGULATORY FACTOR X, 1; RFX1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The RFX1 gene product is a transactivator of the human hepatitis B viral
enhancer I. Reith et al. (1994) commented that The RFX family members,
particularly RFX1 and RFX3 (601337), constitute the nuclear complexes
referred to previously as enhancer factor C (EF-C), EP, and
methylation-dependent DNA-binding protein (MDBP), or rpL30-alpha
(summary by Reith et al., 1994).

Emery et al. (1996) reviewed RFX1, RFX5 (601863), and other members of
the RFX family of DNA binding proteins.

CLONING

Reith et al. (1994) identified and cloned 3 members of the RFX gene
family from both human and mouse using lambda gt11 cDNA libraries.
Homology between the 3 RFX proteins is restricted largely to 5 conserved
regions, including the 2 domains required for DNA binding and
dimerization. Reith et al. (1994) found that RFX1, RFX2 (142765), and
RFX3 have similar DNA-binding specificities. The RFX monomers can
heterodimerize both in vivo and in vitro, but all 3 are capable of
binding DNA as monomers. They showed that the RFX1 transcript is
expressed in many mouse tissues.

MAPPING

Pugliati et al. (1989) used an RFX cDNA for in situ hybridization to
show that the gene maps to 19p13. (Pugliatti's surname was misspelled in
the 1989 abstract.) By in situ hybridization using tritium-labeled RFX1
cDNA, Pugliatti et al. (1992) identified 2 distinct targets on the short
arm of chromosome 19, 19p13.1 and 19p13.3-p13.2. By the use of in situ
hybridization with a biotinylated genomic cosmid clone they localized
RFX1 to 19p13.1. RFX1 is close to another DNA-binding factor, LYL1
(151440). Doyle et al. (1996) physically mapped RFX1 to cosmid contigs
for chromosome 19. The gene was localized between MEL (165040) and LYL1.
Doyle et al. (1996) used interspecific backcross mapping to place Rfx1
in the central region of mouse chromosome 8 near the homolog of JUNB
(165161).

ACONITASE, SOLUBLE; ACONS;;
IRON-RESPONSIVE ELEMENT-BINDING PROTEIN 1; IREB1;;
IRE-BINDING PROTEIN 1; IREBP1; IREBP;;
IRON REGULATORY PROTEIN 1; IRP1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Soluble aconitase is a bifunctional protein with mutually exclusive
functions as an iron responsive element (IRE)-binding protein involved
in the control of iron metabolism or as the cytoplasmic isoform of
aconitase. Aconitases are iron-sulfur proteins that require a 4Fe-4S
cluster for their enzymatic activity, in which they catalyze conversion
of citrate to isocitrate (EC 4.2.1.3) (Eisenstein, 2000).

CLONING

Rouault et al. (1990) used RNA affinity chromatography and 2-dimensional
gel electrophoresis to isolate IREBP for protein sequencing. They used
an oligonucleotide probe derived from the peptide sequence to isolate a
cDNA encoding a protein of 87 kD. The corresponding mRNA of about 3.6 kb
was found in a variety of cell types.

GENE FUNCTION

Aconitase-1 functions as a cytoplasmic IRE-binding protein (IREBP). IREs
are translational regulatory sequences in the 5-prime UTR of ferritin
(see 134790) mRNA and in the 3-prime UTR of transferrin receptor mRNA
(190010). The cytoplasmic IREBP interacts with the IREs of these mRNAs.
The iron status of the cell determines the ability of IREBP to bind to
an IRE through reversible oxidation-reduction of sulfhydryl groups that
are critical for the high-affinity RNA-protein interaction. Thus, IREBP
plays a central role in cellular iron homeostasis by regulating ferritin
mRNA translation and TFRC mRNA stability (Hentze et al., 1989).

Eisenstein (2000) reviewed of the role of the iron regulatory proteins,
IRP1 and IRP2 (147582), and the molecular control of mammalian iron
metabolism.

Meyron-Holtz et al. (2004) found that IRP2-null cells misregulated iron
metabolism when cultured in 3 to 6% oxygen, which is comparable to
physiologic tissue concentrations, but not in 21% oxygen, a
concentration that activated IRP1 and allowed it to substitute for IRP2.
Thus, IRP2 dominates regulation of mammalian iron homeostasis because it
alone registers iron concentrations and modulates its RNA-binding
activity at physiologic oxygen tensions.

Condo et al. (2010) demonstrated that the extramitochondrial form of
frataxin (FXN; 606829) directly interacted with IRP1 through the
'iron-sulfur switch' mechanism. Cytosolic aconitase defect and
consequent IRP1 activation occurring in Friedreich ataxia cells were
reversed by the action of extramitochondrial frataxin.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

IRP1 binds IREs in mRNAs, to repress translation or degradation, or
binds an iron-sulfur cluster, to become a cytosolic aconitase enzyme.
Walden et al. (2006) determined the crystal structure of IRP1 bound to
ferritin H (134770) IRE to 2.8-angstrom resolution. The IRP1:ferritin H
IRE complex showed an open protein conformation compared with that of
cytosolic aconitase. The extended, L-shaped IRP1 molecule embraced the
IRE stem loop through interactions at 2 sites separated by about 30
angstroms, each involving about a dozen protein:RNA bonds. Walden et al.
(2006) concluded that extensive conformational changes related to
binding the IRE or an iron-sulfur cluster explain the alternate
functions of IRP1 as an mRNA regulator or enzyme.

MAPPING

In studies of man-Chinese hamster somatic cell hybrids, Westerveld et
al. (1975) showed that human gal-1-p uridyl transferase (GALT; 606999)
and aconitase are syntenic.

Povey et al. (1976) assigned the ACO1 gene to chromosome 9. ACO1 and
GALT are on chromosome 9p in man and on chromosome 4 in the mouse
(Nadeau and Eicher, 1982). The location in the mouse was predicted from
the human linkage. The smallest region of overlap for ACO1 was estimated
to be 9p22-p13 (Robson and Meera Khan, 1982).

Because of the possibility that idiopathic hemochromatosis, which is the
result of a mutant gene that maps to 6p21, is due to mutation in IREBP,
Hentze et al. (1989) attempted to map the IREBP gene. Since the gene had
not been cloned, and since they did not have specific antibodies for the
protein, they mapped the gene in human/rodent hybrid cells by taking
advantage of the different mobilities of the human and rodent IRE/IREBP
complexes on nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels. Using a panel of 34
different hybrid cell lines, they assigned the IREBP gene to human
chromosome 9. Southern hybridization analysis of rodent-human somatic
hybrid cell lines by Rouault et al. (1990) corroborated the assignment
of IREBP to chromosome 9. A high frequency RFLP was also identified.

By interspecific backcross linkage analysis, Pilz et al. (1995) mapped
the Irebp gene to mouse chromosome 4.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Schmitt and Ritter (1974) found electrophoretic variants of the soluble
form of aconitate hydratase in human placenta. No mitochondrial variants
were found.

Slaughter et al. (1975) reported an electrophoretic survey that
demonstrated 7 alleles at the ACONS locus. Among the populations
studied, Nigerians showed polymorphism for ACONS.

Data on gene frequencies of allelic variants were tabulated by
Roychoudhury and Nei (1988).

EVOLUTION

Aconitase-1 and aconitase-2 (ACO2; 100850) are isozymes present in the
cytosol and mitochondria, respectively. Other pairs of cytosolic and
mitochondrial isozymes are ALDH1 (100640) and ALDH2 (100650), GOT1
(138180) and GOT2 (138150), IDH1 (147700) and IDH2 (147650), MDH1
(154200) and MDH2 (154100), SOD1 (147450) and SOD2 (147460), and TK1
(188300) and TK2 (188250). In all these cases, the 2 isozymes of
different subcellular localization, although similar in structure and
function, are encoded by genes on different chromosomes, i.e., are
nonsyntenic. The presumption is that in each case both originated from a
common ancestral gene in a primordial genome, but that whereas the
cytosolic isozyme is encoded by a gene that is a direct descendant from
a nuclear progenitor gene, the mitochondrial isozyme, although now
encoded by a nuclear gene, is descended from a gene in the
bacterium-like progenitor of the mitochondrion. When this primitive
organism took up intracellular existence, most of its genes were
transferred to the nuclear genome and since they inserted more or less
at random into the nuclear genome, it was to be expected that the
cytosolic and mitochondrial forms of the enzyme would end up being
encoded by genes on different chromosomes. That mitochondrial DNA can be
inserted into the nuclear genome is indicated by work such as that of
Shay and Werbin (1992) who characterized in detail 2 instances of
mitochondrial DNA fragments that had been inserted into the nucleus of
HeLa cells. In one of these cases, the mitochondrial sequence encoding
cytochrome c oxidase subunit III was contiguous with and 5-prime of
exons 2 and 3 of the MYC oncogene (190080) and the chimeric gene was
transcribed. Shay and Werbin (1992) discussed possible mechanisms for
the transfer of mitochondrial DNA into the nucleus.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By positional cloning in a 700-kb critical region for Birt-Hogg-Dube
syndrome (BHD; 135150) on chromosome 17p11.2, Nickerson et al. (2002)
identified a novel gene encoding a deduced 579-amino acid protein
designated folliculin. The protein contains a conserved SLS potential
phosphorylation site, a glutamic acid-rich coiled-coil domain, an
N-glycosylation site, and 3 myristoylation sites. High sequence
conservation was found between human folliculin and homologs in mice,
Drosophila, and C. elegans. Northern blot analysis detected expression
of a 3.8-kb transcript in most normal adult tissues, including skin,
lung, and kidney, and in fetal lung, kidney, liver, and brain tissue.

GENE STRUCTURE

The FLCN gene contains 14 exons (Nickerson et al., 2002).

MAPPING

By positional cloning, Nickerson et al. (2002) identified the FLCN gene
on chromosome 17p11.2.

GENE FUNCTION

Using coimmunoprecipitation of FNIP1 (610594) and FLCN expressed in
HEK293 cells and in vitro binding assays, Baba et al. (2006) showed that
the C terminus of FLCN and amino acids 300 to 1166 of FNIP1 were
required for optimal FLCN-FNIP1 binding. FLCN and FNIP1 colocalized to
the cytoplasm in a reticular pattern. FNIP1 was phosphorylated by AMPK
(see 602739), and its phosphorylation was inhibited in a dose-dependent
manner by an AMPK inhibitor, resulting in reduced FNIP1 expression. FLCN
phosphorylation was diminished by rapamycin and amino acid starvation
and facilitated by FNIP1 overexpression, suggesting that FLCN
phosphorylation may be regulated by mTOR (FRAP1; 601231) and AMPK
signaling. Baba et al. (2006) concluded that FLCN and FNIP1 may be
involved in energy and/or nutrient sensing through the AMPK and mTOR
signaling pathways.

Using small interfering RNAs with several human cell lines, Hartman et
al. (2009) found that downregulation of TSC2 (191092) enhanced
phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 (RPS6; 180460), whereas
downregulation of BHD reduced phosphorylation of RPS6, suggesting that
TSC2 and BHD down- and upregulate activity of the TORC1 complex (see
601231), respectively.

Hudon et al. (2010) confirmed the tumor suppressor activity of FLCN by
nude mouse xenograft assays of 2 human renal cell carcinoma (RCC) lines
with either diminished or reexpressed FLCN. Loss of FLCN expression led
to context-dependent effects on RPS6. The authors observed diminished
and increased activation of Rps6 resulting from diminished and increased
expression levels of FLCN in human RCC cells when grown subcutaneously
as solid tumors. In mouse Flcn +/- kidney sections, Rps6 was elevated in
multilocular and large cysts from polycystic kidneys but was absent in
small single cysts and very low in surrounding normal tissue. Hudon et
al. (2010) concluded that FLCN is a general tumor suppressor in the
kidney, and that loss of FLCN expression results in improperly elevated
or diminished activation of RPS6, depending on cellular context.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome is a rare inherited genodermatosis characterized
by hair follicle hamartomas, kidney tumors, and spontaneous
pneumothorax. In 9 BHD families and an additional 53 probands from small
BHD families, Nickerson et al. (2002) identified insertion or deletion
mutations within a hypermutable C8 tract in exon 11 of the BHD gene in
27 (44%) of 62 patients. Eighteen had a 1-bp duplication (1285dupC;
607273.0001), and 9 had a 1-bp deletion (1285delC; 607273.0002) in the
C8 tract. A slippage-mediated mechanism during DNA replication was
thought to be responsible for these frameshift mutations leading to
protein truncation. Nickerson et al. (2002) also identified an
insertion-deletion mutation (607273.0003), a 28-bp duplication
(607273.0004), and a tyr463-to-ter (Y463X; 607273.0005) mutation.

The studies of Khoo et al. (2002) further confirmed that the poly(C)
tract in exon 11 of the BHD gene is a mutation hotspot.

Shin et al. (2003) screened the poly(C)8 tract of the BHD gene and
identified mutations in 5 (16%) of 32 microsatellite instability (MSI)
sporadic colorectal carcinomas and in 1 (7.7%) of 13 MSI colorectal
carcinoma cell lines. They were unable, however, to find any frameshift
mutation in 80 microsatellite stable (MSS) sporadic carcinomas or 9 MSS
colorectal carcinoma cell lines. In addition, they identified 2
heterozygous missense mutations in different cell lines with MSI. Shin
et al. (2003) found that the 16% frequency of mutations in the BHD gene
was the same as that in the IGF2R gene (147280) and this was less than
that of the TGFBR2 (190182), MSH3 (600887), BAX (600040), and MSH6
(600678) genes. All tumors with the BHD gene mutation harbored
concurrent mutations of the poly(C)8 tract of the MSH6 gene, but the
frameshift mutations of the BHD and IGF2R genes were mutually exclusive.
These findings strongly suggested that the BHD gene is associated with
colon cancer and that putative MSI target genes are involved in the
development of MSI colorectal carcinomas.

Khoo et al. (2002) reported a high incidence of colorectal polyps and
carcinomas in patients with confirmed BHD germline mutations, indicating
that the BHD gene may be involved in colorectal tumorigenesis. Kahnoski
et al. (2003) evaluated the role of the BHD gene in 47 unselected
colorectal tumors (10 polyps and 37 carcinomas) by screening all coding
exons of the BHD gene for mutations and analyzing 46 of the tumors for
loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in the chromosome region surrounding the
BHD locus. Alterations in BHD promoter methylation profiles were
determined in 23 cases of matched normal/carcinoma tissues. They
reported the detection of 2 novel somatic missense mutations of the BHD
gene and LOH in 81% of primary sporadic colorectal tumors with no change
in promoter methylation profile. All mutations were detected in
microsatellite stable (MSS) tumors.

Primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP; 173600), a condition in which air
enters the pleural space and causes secondary lung collapse, is most
often a sporadic trait but also occurs in families. In almost all
patients it is associated with emphysema-like changes (bullae) in the
lungs. By a genomewide scan in a large Finnish family with a dominantly
inherited tendency to PSP, Painter et al. (2005) mapped the PSP locus to
chromosome 17p11 where the FLCN gene maps. Screening of the FLCN gene
revealed a 4-bp deletion in the first coding exon, which created a
frameshift and protein truncation (607273.0009). All carriers of the
deletion had bullous lung lesions. Unlike previously identified
mutations in the FLCN gene, the exon 4 deletion seemed to be associated
only with PSP, which showed 100% penetrance. The results suggested that
changes in FLCN may have an important role in the development of PSP
and, more importantly, of emphysema. Because of the strong association
between primary spontaneous pneumothorax and the Birt-Hogg-Dube
syndrome, Painter et al. (2005) suggested that patients with familial
PSP should be investigated for increased risk of renal cancer.

Schmidt et al. (2005) performed direct sequencing of the BHD gene in 30
families with BHD and reported that combined with their previous data
(Nickerson et al., 2002), they had identified germline BHD mutations in
51 (84%) of 61 families with BHD; 27 (53%) of the mutations involved
either a cytosine insertion or deletion in the mononucleotide tract of 8
cytosines in exon 11 (607273.0001 and 607273.0002, respectively), which
appears to represent a mutation hotspot. Schmidt et al. (2005) noted
that most reported mutations were predicted to terminate folliculin
prematurely and to result in loss of function and suggested that BHD may
act as a tumor suppressor gene.

In 5 of 8 unrelated Japanese patients with multiple lung cysts and
spontaneous pneumothorax, but without skin or renal lesions, Gunji et
al. (2007) identified mutations in the BHD gene (see, e.g., 607273.0001;
607273.0010; 607273.0011). All 5 patients had a family history of the
disorder. Gunji et al. (2007) suggested that isolated pulmonary cysts
and pneumothorax may be a milder form of the BHD syndrome and that
patients should be monitored for renal or skin lesions.

In 10 of 102 Chinese probands with spontaneous pneumothorax, Ren et al.
(2008) identified 4 different mutations in the FLCN gene (see, e.g.,
607273.0001; 607272.0012-607272.0013). Although only 5 of the probands
reported a family history of the disorder, genetic analysis showed that
8 of the probands had family members with either pneumothorax or
pulmonary cysts as determined by imaging studies. Two mutation carriers
from 2 different families did not have pulmonary cysts. The findings
indicated reduced penetrance of both the pneumothorax phenotype and the
cyst phenotype.

In affected individuals from 51 (88%) of 58 families with BHD, Toro et
al. (2008) identified 23 different mutations in the FLCN gene, including
13 novel mutations (see, e.g., 607273.0014). The 1285insC and 1285delC
mutations were most common, occurring in 14 and 5 families,
respectively. All mutations except 1 were predicted to result in a
truncated protein. There were no apparent genotype/phenotype
correlations.

Nahorski et al. (2010) did not find any germline mutations in the FLCN
gene among 50 patients with familial nonsyndromic colorectal cancer. In
the same study involving 51 families with BHD, the authors found that
those with the 1285dupC mutation (607273.0001) had a higher risk of
colorectal neoplasia compared to those with the 610delGCinsTA mutation
(607273.0016) (p = 0.016). Furthermore, somatic frameshift mutations in
the exon 11 C(8) mononucleotide tract of FLCN were detected in 7 (23%)
of 30 sporadic colorectal cancers with microsatellite instability, and
the frequency of these somatic mutations was more common in tumors that
also showed loss of MLH1 (120436) or MSH2 (609309) protein expression.
The findings suggested that FLCN inactivation may contribute to
colorectal tumorigenesis.

Kunogi et al. (2010) identified 15 different heterozygous germline FLCN
mutations, including 2 large genomic deletions (see, e.g., 607273.0017),
in 25 (69.4%) of the 36 Japanese patients with multiple lung cysts of
undetermined cause, all but 1 of whom had suffered at least 1
pneumothorax. Only 6 of the mutation-positive patients had skin lesions,
and 2 others had renal tumors. Kunogi et al. (2010) noted that mutations
were most frequently identified in the 3-prime end of the FLCN gene, and
that these Japanese patients with FLCN mutation had a very low incidence
of skin and renal involvement.

ANIMAL MODEL

Nickerson et al. (2002) pointed to mapping studies suggesting that
germline mutations in dog and rat BHD homologs lead to inherited renal
cancer.

Hereditary multifocal renal cystadenocarcinoma and nodular
dermatofibrosis (RCND) is a naturally occurring canine kidney cancer
syndrome that was originally described in German shepherd dogs. Lingaas
et al. (2003) narrowed the RCND interval to a small region on canine
chromosome 5 that overlapped the human BHD gene. The authors described a
his255-to-arg mutation in exon 7 of the canine Bhd gene that segregated
with the disease phenotype.

Okimoto et al. (2004) studied a model of renal carcinoma found in a
colony of Sprague-Dawley rats in Japan. This hereditary renal carcinoma
model was designated the 'Nihon' rat. In heterozygotes, renal carcinomas
developed from early preneoplastic lesions, seen as early as 3 weeks of
age, into adenomas by 8 weeks of age with complete penetrance of this
renal carcinoma gene by the age of 6 months. The renal carcinomas that
developed in heterozygotes were predominantly of the clear cell type, as
is the case in the Eker rat, which likewise carries a single gene
mutation, in the TSC2 gene (191092), as the cause of renal carcinoma.
The Nihon mutation is tightly linked to genes located on the distal part
of rat chromosome 10 close to the TSC2 gene (Hino et al., 2001). In the
Nihon rat, Okimoto et al. (2004) identified a germline mutation in the
BHD gene caused by insertion of a single nucleotide, resulting in a
frameshift with a stop codon 26 amino acids downstream. They found that
the homozygous mutant condition was lethal at an early stage of fetal
life in the rat. They detected loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the BHD
locus in 10 of 11 primary renal carcinomas and found a nonsense point
mutation in 1 LOH-negative case, fitting the Knudson 2-hit model.
Okimoto et al. (2004) concluded that the Nihon rat provides insights
into a tumor suppressor gene that is related to renal carcinogenesis and
an animal model of human BHD syndrome. In the rat, the TSC2 gene on
chromosome 10 is separated from the BHD gene by the IL3 gene (147740).
In the human, the TSC2 gene is located on 16p13.3 and the BHD gene on
17p11.2. Demonstration of a germline mutation in the BHD gene in the
Nihon rat indicates that there is no homology of synteny in this case.

Hartman et al. (2009) found that targeted deletion of Bhd in mice was
embryonic lethal. Bhd +/- mice had no obvious physical or behavioral
abnormalities, but they developed renal cysts and solid tumors made up
of oncocyte-like cells. These cysts and tumors were visible
microscopically between 3 and 6 months of age, and they increased in
size and severity with age. Between 9 and 17 months of age, Bhd +/- mice
also showed various hyperproliferative diseases of lung, skin, heart,
liver, and spleen. Renal cyst formation in Bhd +/- mice was enhanced by
exposure to the mitogen N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea. The oncocytic cells
lining renal cysts were uniformly negative for phosphorylated Rps6,
while adjacent normal tubules were moderately positive.

Hasumi et al. (2009) reported that heterozygous loss of Bhd in mice
caused kidney tumor development with activation of Torc1 (CRTC1; 607536)
and Torc2 (CRTC2; 608972). Human BHD kidney tumors showed similar
activation of TORC1 and TORC2.

Hudon et al. (2010) generated a mouse model of Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome.
Fcln -/- mice died before embryonic day 8.5, whereas heterozygous mice
manifested early preneoplastic kidney lesions, devoid of Flcn
expression, that progressed toward malignancy, including cytopapillary
adenomas.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
BIRT-HOGG-DUBE SYNDROME
PNEUMOTHORAX, PRIMARY SPONTANEOUS, INCLUDED
FLCN, 1-BP DUP, 1285C

Based on the numbering system used by Wei et al. (2009), the 1733DUPC
mutation has been renumbered as 1285dupC. Nickerson et al. (2002) found
that 27 (44%) of 62 cases of Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome (135150) were due
to a duplication (1285dupC) or a deletion (1285delC; 607273.0002) of 1
cytosine in a hypermutable C8 tract in exon 11 of the FLCN gene. In 18
(29%) of 62 unrelated BHD patients, they found the 1285dupC mutation,
also known as the C9 mutation, resulting in a frameshift and protein
truncation. In 9 (15%) of 62 BHD patients, they found the 1285delC
mutation, also known as the C7 mutation.

Khoo et al. (2002) found the 1285insC and 1285delC mutations in exon 11
of the FLCN gene in 3 of 4 families with BHD as well as in 2 of 4
sporadic cases.

Gunji et al. (2007) identified the 1285insC mutation in a Japanese
patient with isolated pulmonary cysts and primary spontaneous
pneumothorax (173600), but no renal or skin manifestations of the BHD
syndrome. She had her first pneumothorax at age 16 years and had a
cousin with spontaneous pneumothorax.

Ren et al. (2008) identified the 1285insC mutation in affected members
of a Chinese family with primary spontaneous pneumothorax and pulmonary
cysts.

Nahorski et al. (2010), who referred to this mutation as 1285dupC based
on numbering of +1 at the A of the initiation codon, found this mutation
in 37 individuals from 9 families with BHD syndrome. Five individuals
developed a colorectal neoplasm, including 3 with a malignant colorectal
neoplasm, suggesting a genotype/phenotype correlation.

BIRT-HOGG-DUBE SYNDROME
FLCN, 1-BP DEL, 1285C

Based on the numbering system used by Wei et al. (2009), the 1733DELC
mutation has been renumbered as 1285delC. See 607273.0002 and Nickerson
et al. (2002). The 1285delC mutation, which occurs in exon 11 of the
FLCN gene, produces a frameshift and protein truncation.

.0003
BIRT-HOGG-DUBE SYNDROME
FLCN, 2-BP DEL, 632AG AND 1-BP INS, 632C

Based on the numbering system used by Wei et al. (2009), the
1087DELAGINSC mutation has been renumbered as 632delAGinsC. In affected
members of a family with Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome (135150), Nickerson et
al. (2002) found an insertion-deletion mutation in exon 7 of the FLCN
gene, resulting in a frameshift with protein truncation.

BIRT-HOGG-DUBE SYNDROME
FLCN, 28-BP DUP, NT923

Based on the numbering system used by Wei et al. (2009), the
1378_1405DUP mutation has been renumbered as 923_950dup. In In a family
with Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome (135150), Nickerson et al. (2002) found
that affected members had a 28-bp duplication in exon 9 of the FLCN
gene. The mutation produced a frameshift and protein truncation.

.0005
BIRT-HOGG-DUBE SYNDROME
FLCN, TYR463TER

Nickerson et al. (2002) found that affected members of a family with
Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome (135150) had a tyr463-to-ter (Y463X) mutation
resulting from a C-to-G transversion at nucleotide 1844 in exon 12.
Based on the numbering system used by Wei et al. (2009), this mutation
has been renumbered as 1389C-G.

.0006
RENAL CARCINOMA, CHROMOPHOBE, SOMATIC
FLCN, 2-BP DEL, 1284TC AND 2-BP INS, 1284AC

Based on the numbering system used by Wei et al. (2009), this mutation
has been renumbered as 1284delTCinsAC. In a chromophobe renal carcinoma
occurring in a patient with Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome (135150), Khoo et
al. (2002) demonstrated a novel somatic mutation, 1732DELTCINSAC. This
demonstrated that the Knudson second hit in some BHD-related tumors is a
somatic mutation rather than loss of heterozygosity. The pedigree
indicated affected members in 3 successive generations and by inference
in a fourth earlier generation. The germline mutation occurred in the
poly(C) tract in exon 11 of the FLCN gene.

.0007
COLORECTAL CANCER, SOMATIC
FLCN, SER79TRP

In a colorectal carcinoma (114500), Kahnoski et al. (2003) found a
somatic missense mutation, ser79 to trp (S79W).

COLORECTAL CANCER, SOMATIC
FLCN, ALA445THR

In a colorectal carcinoma (114500), Kahnoski et al. (2003) found a
somatic missense mutation, ala445 to thr (A445T).

PNEUMOTHORAX, PRIMARY SPONTANEOUS
FLCN, 4-BP DEL, 235TCGG

In affected members of a family with primary spontaneous pneumothorax
(173600) inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, Painter et al.
(2005) identified a 4-bp deletion in exon 4 (the first coding exon) of
the FLCN gene (733delTCGG, or 690delTCGG), causing a frameshift and a
stop codon 50 amino acids downstream. All family members with bullous
lung lesions were heterozygous for the mutation with the exception of 1
male who had experienced one PSP episode; the authors considered PSP in
this individual to be sporadic. Based on the numbering system used by
Wei et al. (2009), this mutation has been renumbered as 235delTCGG.

.0010
PNEUMOTHORAX, PRIMARY SPONTANEOUS
FLCN, 4-BP DEL, 1533GATG

In affected members of a Japanese family with pulmonary cysts and
primary spontaneous pneumothorax (173600), Gunji et al. (2007)
identified a heterozygous 4-bp deletion (1988delGATG) in exon 13 of the
FLCN gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature protein termination.
Based on the numbering system used by Wei et al. (2009), this mutation
has been renumbered as 1533delGATG.

.0011
PNEUMOTHORAX, PRIMARY SPONTANEOUS
FLCN, 1-BP DEL, 404C

In a Japanese woman with pulmonary cysts and spontaneous pneumothorax
(173600), Gunji et al. (2007) identified a heterozygous 1-bp deletion
(857DELC) in exon 6 of the FLCN gene, resulting in a frameshift and
premature protein termination. She had her first pneumothorax at age 25
years. Her brother and father were affected; her father also had a

PNEUMOTHORAX, PRIMARY SPONTANEOUS
FLCN, 3-BP DEL, 469TTC

Based on the numbering system used by Wei et al. (2009), this mutation
has been renumbered as 469delTTC. In affected members of 4 unrelated
Chinese families with spontaneous pneumothorax and/or pulmonary cysts
(173600), Ren et al. (2008) identified a 3-bp in-frame deletion
(924DELTTC) in exon 6 of the FLCN gene, resulting in loss of the phe157
residue. One of the families had 6 mutation carriers. Two patients from
different families were unaffected. Haplotype analysis excluded a common
ancestry.

.0013
PNEUMOTHORAX, PRIMARY SPONTANEOUS
FLCN, 20-BP DEL, NT1156

Based on the numbering system used by Wei et al. (2009), this mutation
has been renumbered as 1156_1175del. In affected members of 4 unrelated
Chinese families with spontaneous pneumothorax and/or pulmonary cysts
(173600), Ren et al. (2008) identified a 20-bp deletion at nucleotide

syndrome (135150), Toro et al. (2008) identified a heterozygous A-to-G
transition in intron 4 of the FLCN gene, predicted to result in
premature protein termination. Based on the numbering system used by Wei
et al. (2009), this mutation has been renumbered as 250-2A-G.

.0015
BIRT-HOGG-DUBE SYNDROME
FLCN, 11-BP DEL, NT1301-2 AND 1-BP DEL/2-BP INS, NT1323

In 18 members of a large Dutch family with Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome
(135150), Kluijt et al. (2009) identified a heterozygous complex
mutation in the FLCN gene consisting of an 11-bp deletion in intron 11
(c.1756-7del11), resulting in the deletion of the splice acceptor site
of exon 12, and a 1-bp deletion/2-bp insertion in exon 12
(c.1778delCinsGA). Two family members developed early-onset renal cancer
at age 27 and 32 years, respectively. Based on the numbering system used
by Wei et al. (2009), these mutations have been renumbered as

insertion (610delGCinsTA) in exon 6 of the FLCN gene. None of the
patients with this mutation developed a colorectal polyp or colorectal
cancer. The authors noted that the mutation had been previously

312180	TITLE *312180 UBIQUITIN-CONJUGATING ENZYME E2A; UBE2A
;;RAD6, YEAST, HOMOLOG OF, TYPE A; RAD6A;;
HHR6A
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

As deduced from the pleiotropic phenotype of rad6 deletion mutants in
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the RAD6 protein plays an important role in
various cellular processes. The protein is strongly conserved in
eukaryotic evolution, a property that permitted Koken et al. (1991) to
clone to human homologs by evolutionary walking using
Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Drosophila melanogaster homologs as
'intermediates.' The human HHR6A and HHR6B (179095) proteins (HHR for
human homolog of rad6) shared about 95% amino acid sequence identity
with each other and about 70% amino acid sequence with their yeast
counterparts, but notably lacked the acidic C-terminal domain, the
occurrence of which seemed to be limited to S. cerevisiae rad6.

GENE FUNCTION

Ulrich and Jentsch (2000) demonstrated that RAD18 (605256) and RAD5
(608048), play a central role in mediating physical contacts between the
members of the RAD6 pathway. RAD5 recruits the UBC13 (603679)-MMS2
(603001) complex to DNA by means of its RING finger domain. Moreover,
RAD5 association with RAD18 brings UBC13-MMS2 into contact with the
RAD6-RAD18 complex. Interaction between the 2 RING finger proteins thus
promotes the formation of a heteromeric complex in which the 2 distinct
ubiquitin-conjugating activities of RAD6 and UBC13-MMS2 can be closely
coordinated. Ulrich and Jentsch (2000) found that while UBC13 and MMS2
are largely cytosolic proteins, DNA damage triggers their redistribution
to the nucleus.

Hishida et al. (2009) examined the response of yeast cells to chronic
low dose ultraviolet light (CLUV) and identified a key role for the
RAD6-RAD18-RAD5 error-free postreplication repair (PRR) pathway in
promoting cell growth and survival. They found that loss of the RAD6
error-free PRR pathway resulted in DNA damage checkpoint-induced G2
arrest in CLUV-exposed cells, whereas wildtype and nucleotide excision
repair-deficient cells were largely unaffected. Cell cycle arrest in the
absence of the RAD6 error-free PRR pathway was not caused by a repair
defect or by the accumulation of ultraviolet-induced photoproducts.
Hishida et al. (2009) observed increased replication protein A (RPA; see
179835)- and Rad52 (600392)-yellow fluorescent protein foci in the
CLUV-exposed Rad18 (605256)-delta cells and demonstrated that
Rad52-mediated homologous recombination is required for the viability of
the Rad18-delta cells after release from CLUV-induced G2 arrest. These
and other data presented suggest that, in response to environmental
levels of ultraviolet exposure, the RAD6 error-free PRR pathway promotes
replication of damaged templates without the generation of extensive
single-stranded DNA regions. Thus this pathway is specifically important
during chronic low dose ultraviolet exposure to prevent
counterproductive DNA checkpoint activation and allow cells to
proliferate normally.

MAPPING

By in situ hybridization with biotinylated probes, Koken et al. (1992)
localized the RAD6A gene to Xq24-q25 and the RAD6B gene (179095) to
5q23-q31. The assignment of RAD6A to the X chromosome was confirmed with
an X-specific human-mouse/hamster somatic cell hybrid panel.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 3 males with X-linked syndromic mental retardation (MRXSN; 300860),
Nascimento et al. (2006) identified a nonsense mutation in the UBE2A
gene (Q128X; 312180.0001). The presumptive obligate carriers had
completely skewed X inactivation in leukocytes, as demonstrated by the
methylation status of the CAG repeat of the androgen receptor gene
(313700). Indeed, skewed X-chromosome inactivation appears to be
characteristic of carriers of many gene mutations involved in XLMR
(Plenge et al., 2002). This prompted a search for an X-linked gene
involved in the syndrome in this family. Given the family's small size,
an inclusion-mapping strategy was performed. Genotyping of 36 markers
spaced at approximately 5 cM disclosed 3 loci, at Xq23-q25, harboring
alleles shared by all 3 affected males. Nascimento et al. (2006) found
30 genes within a narrowed candidate region that were expressed in
brain. However, only 1 of these gene, UBE2A, was expressed in both brain
and lymphocytes. Because of the skewed X-inactivation in the patients'
mothers, which likely represented the survival/proliferation advantage
of lymphocytes with the active normal allele in a woman with the
mutation, the authors sequenced the UBE2A gene and found a 382C-T
substitution leading to a premature stop codon (Q128X; 312180) in all 3
affected males and in their mothers. The sister of 1 of the affected
males, with a rather random X-inactivation pattern as documented by the
methylation status of the AR gene, did not carry this mutation. No
mutations in UBE2A were found in 19 idiopathic XLMR-affected families
mapped to intervals encompassing UBE2A.

In affected members of 2 unrelated families with syndromic XLMR, Budny
et al. (2010) identified 2 different missense mutations in the UBE2A
gene (312180.0002 and 312180.0003, respectively). The phenotype was
characterized by mental retardation and very poor speech, as well as
striking dysmorphic features, including large head, synophrys, prominent
supraorbital ridges, almond-shaped and deep-set eyes, large ears, wide
mouth, myxedematous appearance, hirsutism, abnormal hair whorls,
micropenis, and onychodystrophy.

MENTAL RETARDATION, X-LINKED, SYNDROMIC, NASCIMENTO TYPE
UBE2A, GLN128TER

In 3 males with an X-linked mental retardation syndrome (300860) in 3
sibships connected through carrier females in 2 generations, Nascimento
et al. (2006) identified a 382C-T transition in the UBE2A gene leading
to a premature UAG stop codon (gln128 to stop; Q128X). As a consequence
of the mutation, the predicted polypeptide lacked the 25 C-terminal
amino acid residues. The importance of this terminal sequence for UBE2
function was inferred by its conservation in vertebrates and in
Drosophila. No UBE2A mutations were found in 15 families with
nonsyndromic and 4 families with syndromic idiopathic XLMR previously
mapped to intervals encompassing this gene. This was the first
description of a mutation in a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme gene as the
cause of a human disease. The affected males in the family presented a
neurodevelopmental disorder that included seizures, severe speech
impairment, marked general hirsutism, synophrys, and a low posterior
hairline.

UBE2A, GLY23ARG

In affected members of a large 5-generation family with X-linked
syndromic mental retardation (300860), Budny et al. (2010) identified a
67G-A transition in exon 2 of the UBE2A gene, resulting in a
gly23-to-arg (G23R) substitution in a highly conserved residue. The
mutation was not found in unaffected family members or in 168 male
controls. Three obligate female carriers showed skewed X-inactivation
profiles. The mutation was found by linkage analysis followed by
candidate gene sequencing. Functional studies were not performed.

.0003

UBE2A, ARG11GLN

In 2 males from a family with X-linked syndromic mental retardation
(300860), Budny et al. (2010) identified a 32G-A transition in exon 1 of
the UBE2A gene, resulting in an arg11-to-gln (R11Q) substitution in a
highly conserved residue. The mutation was not found in unaffected
family members or in 168 male controls. Functional studies were not
performed.

609671	TITLE *609671 SIX-TRANSMEMBRANE EPITHELIAL ANTIGEN OF PROSTATE 3; STEAP3
;;TUMOR SUPPRESSOR-ACTIVATED PATHWAY 6; TSAP6
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Passer et al. (2003) cloned human STEAP3, which they called TSAP6, from
a pooled-tissue cDNA library. The deduced 488-amino acid protein
contains an N-terminal motif associated with oxidoreductases and
dehydrogenases and 5 or 6 transmembrane domains. Human TSAP6 shares 87%
amino acid identity with mouse Tsap6. Northern blot analysis of human
tissues detected a 4.3-kb transcript expressed highly in liver and at a
lower level in skeletal muscle. Heart, brain, placenta, lung, kidney,
and pancreas expressed little to no TSAP6. Northern blot analysis of
mouse tissues detected expression predominantly in heart, spleen, lung,
liver, and skeletal muscle. Western blot analysis of mouse and human
cell lines detected TSAP6 at an apparent molecular mass of 50 to 55 kD.

Using Western blot analysis, Lespagnol et al. (2008) detected Tsap6
proteins of 46 and 52 kD in mouse NIH3T3 cells, and they showed that the
larger protein resulted from glycosylation. Confocal microscopy of mouse
embryonic fibroblasts showed colocalization of endogenous Tsap6 with the
trans-Golgi network maker Tgn38 (TGOLN; 603062). Punctuated cytoplasmic
and plasma membrane staining of Tsap6 partially colocalized with
transferrin receptor (TFRC; 190010) and Eea1 (605070), suggesting that
Tsap6 is expressed in the endosomal compartment.

MAPPING

By FISH, Passer et al. (2003) mapped the STEAP3 gene to chromosome
2q14.2. They mapped the mouse Steap3 gene to chromosome 1.

GENE FUNCTION

Using Northern blot analysis, Passer et al. (2003) found that p53 (TP53;
191170) upregulated TSAP6 expression in mouse and human cell lines. They
identified a p53-responsive element upstream of the first exon of the
mouse Tsap6 gene. TSAP6 antisense cDNA decreased the level of
p53-induced apoptosis, and TSAP6 small interfering RNA inhibited
apoptosis in TSAP6-overexpressing cells. Yeast 2-hybrid analysis,
protein pull-down assays, and coimmunoprecipitation analysis revealed
that TSAP6 interacted with NIX (BNIP3; 605368), a proapoptotic BCL2
(151430)-related protein, and with MYT1 kinase (602474), a negative
regulator of G2/M transition. Moreover, TSAP6 enhanced the
susceptibility of cells to apoptosis and cooperated with NIX to
exacerbate this effect. Cell cycle studies indicated that TSAP6 could
augment MYT1 activity. Passer et al. (2003) concluded that TSAP6 may act
downstream of p53 to interface apoptosis and cell cycle progression.

Histamine-releasing factor (TPT1; 600763) is a secreted protein that
participates in inflammatory responses by promoting the release of
histamine. Amzallag et al. (2004) found that secretion of TPT1 proceeded
by a nonclassical pathway independent of the endoplasmic reticulum and
Golgi apparatus. They determined that TSAP6 interacted with TPT1 in
several protein interaction assays, and the 2 proteins codistributed to
small vesicles called exosomes at the plasma membrane and around the
nucleus in several human cell lines. Overexpression of TSAP6 increased
the level of TPT1 in exosome preparations and consistently enhanced TPT1
secretion. Amzallag et al. (2004) concluded that TSAP6 has a role in the
export of TPT1 via a nonclassical pathway and suggested that TSAP6 may
have a general role in the regulation of vesicular trafficking and
secretion.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 3 sibs with hypochromic microcytic anemia and iron overload (615234),
born of nonconsanguineous Pakistani parents, Grandchamp et al. (2011)
analyzed 7 candidate genes and identified heterozygosity for a nonsense
mutation in the STEAP3 gene (C100X; 609671.0001) that was inherited from
their unaffected father. Quantitative analysis of mRNA levels suggested
that the father was heterozygous with 1 null allele and 1 normal, highly
expressed allele, whereas their unaffected mother had 2 weakly expressed
alleles, and each affected offspring had inherited the mutated allele
from their father and 1 of the weakly expressed alleles from their
mother. Using two 3-prime common polymorphisms in high linkage
disequilibrium as markers to perform quantitative sequencing of cDNA
from the blood of 20 control individuals, Grandchamp et al. (2011)
demonstrated a 2.5-fold variation in the C/T and A/C ratios among 17
individuals informative for dbSNP rs6753006 and 12 individuals
informative for dbSNP rs3731603, respectively, thus confirming
variability of STEAP3 expression in the general population.

ANIMAL MODEL

The reduction of iron is an essential step in the transferrin (TF;
190000) cycle, which is the dominant pathway for iron uptake by red
blood cell precursors. A deficiency in iron acquisition by red blood
cells leads to hypochromic, microcytic anemia. Using a positional
cloning strategy, Ohgami et al. (2005) identified the Steap3 gene as
responsible for the iron deficiency anemia in the mouse mutant nm1054.
They showed that Steap3 is expressed highly in hematopoietic tissues,
colocalizes with the transferrin cycle endosome, and facilitates
transferrin-bound iron uptake. Overexpression of Steap3 stimulated the
reduction of iron, and mice lacking Steap3 were deficient in erythroid
ferrireductase activity. These findings taken together were interpreted
as indicating that Steap3 is an endosomal ferrireductase required for
efficient transferrin-dependent iron uptake in erythroid cells.

Lespagnol et al. (2008) generated Tsap6 -/- mice and found that Tsap6
-/- splenocytes accumulated Tctp (TPT1) and Tfrc. Spleens of Tsap6 -/-
mice were enlarged with altered splenic architecture on histopathologic
analysis, and reticulocytes and erythrocytes were small and abnormally
shaped, consistent with microcytic anemia. Analysis of reticulocyte
maturation revealed a delay in Tfrc expulsion and reduced secretion of
exosomes. Induction of p53-mediated apoptosis, but not of p53- dependent
p21 (CDKN1A; 116899) expression, was attenuated in Tsap6 -/- spleen.
Following activation of p53 by DNA damage, Tsap6 -/- cells exhibited a
significant reduction in exosome secretion and an absence of exosomal
protein upregulation compared with wildtype controls. Lespagnol et al.
(2008) concluded that increased p53-mediated secretion of exosomes
following DNA damage is dependent on TSAP6 and that TSAP6 is needed to
expel proteins no longer required by cells.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
ANEMIA, HYPOCHROMIC MICROCYTIC, WITH IRON OVERLOAD 2 (1 family)
STEAP3, CYS100TER

In 3 sibs with hypochromic microcytic anemia and iron overload (615234),
born of nonconsanguineous Pakistani parents, Grandchamp et al. (2011)
identified heterozygosity for a c.300C-A transition in exon 3 of the
STEAP3 gene, resulting in a cys100-to-ter (C100X) substitution. The
mutation was inherited from their unaffected father and was not found in
their unaffected mother or 200 control chromosomes. Quantitative RT-PCR
from blood mRNA of all 5 family members and 10 controls showed that the
STEAP3 mRNA level was considerably lower in the 3 patients, whereas both
parents had a level of STEAP3 mRNA corresponding to the low-normal range
found in controls. In B lymphocyte-cell lines treated to prevent
degradation due to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, quantitative sequencing
of a cDNA fragment encompassing the mutated nucleotide demonstrated that
expression of the normal allele relative to that of the mutated allele
was significantly higher in the father than in the 3 sibs. Grandchamp et
al. (2011) suggested that the father was heterozygous with 1 null allele
and 1 normal, highly expressed allele, whereas the mother had 2 weakly
expressed alleles, and each affected offspring had inherited the mutated
allele from their father and 1 of the weakly expressed alleles from
their mother. This was supported by the fact that expression of both
alleles from the mother produced an amount of mRNA that was roughly
equivalent to the expression products from the single normal allele of
the father.

609212	TITLE *609212 ASPARAGINASE-LIKE PROTEIN 1; ASRGL1
;;ALP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Obstruction of the male reproductive tract causes an autoimmune
response. Using rat sera collected after vasectomy, Bush et al. (2002)
identified Alp as an autoantigenic protein, and they cloned the cDNA
from a rat testis cDNA library. By database searching and PCR of a
testis cDNA library, they cloned human ALP. The deduced 308-amino acid
protein contains an O-glycosylation site, several putative
phosphorylation sites, and a putative cleavage site for activation of
the precursor protein into alpha and beta asparaginase subunits. The
human and rat proteins share 77% identity. Northern blot analysis of rat
tissues detected 2.5- and 1.4-kb transcripts. Highest expression was in
testis, with lower expression in brain, liver, kidney, heart, and
skeletal muscle, and no expression in spleen. Western blot analysis of
human sperm extracts revealed 2 ALP peptides of 25 and 17 kD.
Immunofluorescence visualization of fixed spermatozoa detected ALP
expression at the midpiece, where it colocalized with a mitochondrial
marker.

GENE STRUCTURE

Bush et al. (2002) determined that the ASRGL1 gene contains 9 exons.
Exons 8 and 9 are an exact tandem duplication of exons 6 and 7.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Bush et al. (2002) mapped the ASRGL1 gene
to chromosome 11q12.3.

607156	TITLE *607156 ST3 BETA-GALACTOSIDE ALPHA-2,3-SIALYLTRANSFERASE 6; ST3GAL6
;;ALPHA-2,3-SIALYLTRANSFERASE VI; ST3GALVI
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Sialyltransferases, such as ST3GAL6, catalyze the transfer of sialic
acid from cytidine 5-prime monophospho-N-acetylneuraminic acid
(CMP-NeuAc) to terminal positions of glycoprotein and glycolipid
carbohydrate groups. Terminal NeuAc residues are key determinants of
carbohydrate structures, such as the sialyl-Lewis X determinants, and
are widely distributed in many cell types.

CLONING

Using mouse St3galv (SIAT9; 604402) as the probe, Okajima et al. (1999)
cloned ST3GALVI from a human melanoma cDNA library. The deduced
331-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of about 38 kD.
It contains an N-terminal type II transmembrane domain, 2 sialyl motifs,
a C-terminal motif conserved among ST3GAL subfamily members, and 6
potential N-linked glycosylation sites. The ST3GALVI protein shares 38%,
34%, and 33% identity with ST3GALIV, ST3GALIII, and mouse St3galv,
respectively. Northern blot analysis revealed abundant expression of
1.8- and 3.0-kb transcripts in heart, placenta, and liver, with lower
levels in most other tissues tested.

By 5-prime RACE of human hepatocellular carcinoma cDNA, Taniguchi et al.
(2001) determined that there are 2 forms of ST3GALVI mRNA, which they
called type 1 and type 2, that differ only in the 5-prime untranslated
region. RNA dot blot analysis revealed that ST3GALVI is expressed at
similar levels in most tissues, with highest levels in septum
interventricle and pericardium. Type-1 mRNA was enriched in septum
interventricle, adipose tissue, and lymph nodes, and type-2 mRNA was
enriched in prostate.

GENE FUNCTION

Okajima et al. (1999) determined that ST3GALVI, in contrast to ST3GALIII
and ST3GALIV, exhibits restricted substrate specificity. Their analysis
led them to conclude that ST3GALVI is involved in the synthesis of
sialyl-paragloboside, a precursor of sialyl-Lewis X determinant.
However, expression of ST3GALVI did not correlate well with sialyl-LeX
expression among several human cancer cell lines.

GENE STRUCTURE

Taniguchi et al. (2001) determined that the ST3GALVI gene contains 10
exons and spans more than 62 kb. They identified 2 unique promoter
regions corresponding to 2 mRNA species. The promoters have different
constellations of putative transcriptional factor-binding sites, and the
type-2 mRNA promoter lacks a canonical TATA box found in the type-1 mRNA
promoter.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the
ST3GALVI gene to chromosome 3 (TMAP stSG8985).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Cheung et al. (2003) undertook to determine how extensive variation in
transcript levels is and to what extent individual differences in
expression level are genetically determined. They used lymphoblastoid
cells to examine variation in gene expression and identified 40 genes
whose transcript levels differed greatly among unrelated individuals.
The 40 genes with the highest variance ratios were not clustered in
genomic location; instead, they mapped to many chromosomes across the
genome. The ST3GALVI gene was one of the most highly variable and was
used to investigate the genetic basis of variation among 3 groups of
people: 49 unrelated individuals; offspring from CEPH families; and 10
pairs of monozygotic twins. For this and 4 other genes studied in this
way, variability in expression levels was less in more closely related
individuals and least in monozygotic twins, with intermediate
variability in sibs and greatest variability in unrelated individuals.
Of the 5 genes examined, the variance among unrelated individuals was 3
to 11 times greater than that between monozygotic twins, and the
variance among sibs was 2 to 5 times greater than that between twins.

611687	TITLE *611687 KHDC3-LIKE PROTEIN, SUBCORTICAL MATERNAL COMPLEX MEMBER; KHDC3L
;;CHROMOSOME 6 OPEN READING FRAME 221; C6ORF221;;
EMBRYONIC STEM CELL-ASSOCIATED TRANSCRIPT 1; ECAT1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching for genes similar to the 3 mouse Khdc1 genes, Pierre et al.
(2007) identified a family of related genes in eutherian mammals. In
humans, this family includes KHDC1 (611688), DPPA5 (611111), OOEP
(611689), and ECAT1 (KHDC3L), which is absent in rodents. The proteins
encoded by these genes contain an atypical KH domain with amino acid
changes at critical sites, suggesting that it may not bind RNA like
canonical KH domains.

Parry et al. (2011) investigated the expression of C6ORF221 by using
RT-PCR on amplified cDNA derived from a developmental series of staged
human ovarian follicles, oocytes, preimplantation embryos, and human
blastocysts. Expression appeared to be maximal in germinal vesicle
oocytes, tapering off through metaphase II oocytes, and becoming
undetectable following the completion of the oocyte to embryo
transition. Parry et al. (2011) noted that this temporal pattern of
expression is similar to that reported for NLRP7 (609661) and is typical
of the expression reported for oocyte-specific genes.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Pierre et al. (2007) mapped the ECAT1 gene
to chromosome 6q13.

EVOLUTION

Pierre et al. (2007) identified a family of KHDC1-related genes,
including ECAT1, in eutherian mammals, but not in fish, bird, or
opossum. These genes map to a single syntenic region in human,
chimpanzee, macaque, dog, and bovine, but a paracentric inversion
separated the genes in mouse and rat. Pierre et al. (2007) noted that
the ECAT1 gene is absent in rodents.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a multiply consanguineous Pakistani family with recurrent biparental
complete hydatidiform mole (HYDM2; 614293) that did not map to the known
locus on chromosome 19q (HYDM1; 231090), Parry et al. (2011) performed a
homozygosity scan and identified a mutation in the initiation codon of
the C6ORF221 gene (611687.0001) that segregated with disease in the
family and was not found in 328 ethnically matched control chromosomes.
By sequencing of C6ORF221 in 14 additional probands with recurrent
hydatidiform mole who were known to be negative for mutation in the
NLRP7 gene (609661) on chromosome 19q, Parry et al. (2011) identified
mutations in homozygous or compound heterozygous state in 2
(611687.0002-611687.0003).

Fallahian et al. (2013) performed genetic analysis of tissue from the
fourth complete hydatidiform mole (CHM) pregnancy of the woman in whom
Parry et al. (2011) had identified compound heterozygosity for mutations
in the KDHC3L gene (see 611687.0002), and detected 1 nonmaternal and 2
maternal alleles, consistent with a digynic triploid conceptus. The
proband's sister, who was also compound heterozygous for the KDHC3L
mutations, had undergone 2 CHM pregnancies; genotyping of the second CHM
showed that it was a biparental CHM, with both a maternal and paternal
contribution to the genome. Fallahian et al. (2013) stated that these
findings were consistent with a role for KDHC3L in setting and/or
maintaining the maternal imprint.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HYDATIDIFORM MOLE, RECURRENT, 2
KDHC3L, 3G-T

In affected individuals from a multiply consanguineous Pakistani family
with recurrent biparental complete hydatidiform mole (HYDM2; 614293),
previously studied by Judson et al. (2002), Parry et al. (2011)
identified homozygosity for a 3G-T transversion in the initiation codon
of the C6ORF221 gene, predicted to change ATG to ATT. Functional
analysis in HEK293 cells confirmed production of a shortened protein,
consistent with initiation of the mutant protein at the next available
ATG at position 14. The mutation segregated with disease in the family
and was not found in 328 ethnically matched control chromosomes.

.0002
HYDATIDIFORM MOLE, RECURRENT, 2
KDHC3L, 4-BP DEL, 322GACT

In the proband from a Tunisian family with recurrent biparental complete
hydatidiform mole (HYDM2; 614293), previously studied by Landolsi et al.
(2011), Parry et al. (2011) identified homozygosity for a 4-bp deletion
(322delGACT) in exon 2 of the C6ORF221 gene, causing a frameshift and
resulting in premature termination after 29 novel amino acids. The
mutation was not found in 208 Tunisian control chromosomes. In a proband
of Asian origin with biparental recurrent hydatidiform mole, previously
studied by Wang et al. (2009), Parry et al. (2011) identified compound
heterozygosity for the 4-bp deletion and a 1A-G transition in the
initiation codon of the C6ORF221 gene (611687.0003). Neither mutation
was found in more than 1,100 individuals for whom a genotype could be
called in the 1000 Genomes Project.

Fallahian et al. (2013) performed genetic analysis of tissue from the
fourth complete hydatidiform mole pregnancy of the woman previously
studied by Wang et al. (2009), in whom Parry et al. (2011) had
identified compound heterozygosity for mutations in the KDHC3L gene.
Although DNA was unavailable from her partner, 2 alleles were maternal
in origin and a third allele was nonmaternal, consistent with a digynic
triploid conceptus. The proband had 1 sister with 3 normal pregnancies,
but another sister, who was also compound heterozygous for the KDHC3L
mutations, had undergone 2 CHM pregnancies; genotyping of the second CHM
showed that it was a biparental CHM, with both a maternal and paternal
contribution to the genome.

610440	TITLE *610440 SMALL G PROTEIN SIGNALING MODULATOR 3; SGSM3
;;RUN AND TBC1 DOMAINS-CONTAINING PROTEIN 3; RUTBC3;;
MERLIN-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN; MAP;;
MERLIN-BINDING PROTEIN;;
RUSC3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using full-length merlin (NF2; 607379) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid
screen of a brain cDNA library, followed by RACE-PCR of placenta cDNA,
Lee et al. (2004) cloned RUTBC3, which they called MAP. The deduced
749-amino acid protein has a predicted molecular mass of 84.5 kD,
confirmed by in vitro translation. RUTBC3 contains an N-terminal TBC
domain, a central SH3 domain, and a C-terminal RUN domain. Northern blot
analysis detected 2.8- and 3.6-kb transcripts in most human tissues
examined, with highest expression in skeletal muscle and heart, followed
by spleen, thymus, liver, kidney, and placenta. Immunoblot analysis
detected RUTBC3 expression in neuroblastoma, lung carcinoma, mammary
adenocarcinoma, and NIH3T3 cell lines.

By database searching with the sequence of small G protein signaling
modulator-1 (SGSM1; 610440) as query, Yang et al. (2007) identified and
subsequently cloned RUTBC3, which they called SGSM3, from a human brain
cDNA library. The deduced protein shares a RAP (see RAP1A,
179520)-interacting domain (RAPID) (amino acids 301-350), containing 5
conserved blocks of sequence following the RUN domain, with SGSM1 and
SGSM2 (611418). Northern blot analysis detected variable expression of
3.4- and 4.0-kb SGSM3 transcripts in several human tissues. Mouse
tissues showed a similar Sgsm3 expression profile.

GENE FUNCTION

Using in vitro and in vivo assays, Lee et al. (2004) showed that RUTBC3
binds merlin and that the interaction is mediated by the RUTBC3 RUN
domain and the C-terminal region of merlin. By confocal microscopy of
RUTBC3 and merlin expressed in NIH3T3 cells, the authors found that
RUTBC3 localized to perinuclear and membrane regions and merlin
localized to the cytoplasmic membrane. When RUTBC3 was coexpressed with
merlin, RUTBC3 and merlin colocalized to the cytoplasmic membrane. In
NIH3T3 cells, RUTBC3 increased merlin-mediated repression of
AP1-dependent promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner. Expression
of either RUTBC3 or merlin alone reduced colony formation to between 50
and 60% of the control level, and coexpression further inhibited colony
formation to 10% of the control level. Lee et al. (2004) concluded that
RUTBC3 acts in cooperation with merlin to enhance suppression of cell
growth.

Using immunoprecipitation and Western blot analyses of proteins
expressed by transfected human embryonic kidney cells, Yang et al.
(2007) showed that SGSM1, SGSM2, and SGSM3 coimmunoprecipitated with all
RAP proteins examined, including RAP1A, RAP1B (179530), RAP2A (179540),
and RAP2B (179541). Yang et al. (2007) also found that endogenous Rab4
(179511) and Rab11 (see RAB11A, 605570) interacted with all SGSM
proteins in the mouse neuroblastoma cell line; however, Rab3 (see RAB3A,
179490), Rab5 (see RAB5A, 179512), and Rab8 (see RAB8A, 165040)
interacted only with SGSM1 and SGSM3.

GENE STRUCTURE

Yang et al. (2007) determined that the SGSM3 gene contains 22 exons.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the SGSM3
gene to chromosome 22 (TMAP NIB2041). By genomic sequence analysis, Yang
et al. (2007) localized the gene to 22q13.1.

606269	TITLE *606269 TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR RECEPTOR SUPERFAMILY, MEMBER 13C; TNFRSF13C
;;B CELL-ACTIVATING FACTOR RECEPTOR;;
BAFF RECEPTOR; BAFFR
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The TNFRSF13C gene encodes the B cell-activating factor receptor, whose
ligand, TNFSF13B (BAFF; 603969) enhances B-cell survival in vitro and is
a regulator of the peripheral B-cell population (Thompson et al., 2001).

CLONING

Overexpression of Baff in mice results in mature B-cell hyperplasia and
symptoms of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE; 152700) (Mackay et al.,
1999). Likewise, some SLE patients have increased levels of BAFF in
serum. Like APRIL (TNFSF13; 604472), BAFF binds to both TACI (604907)
and BCMA (TNFRSF17; 109545); however, mice deficient in these molecules
maintain some B-cell function (Xu and Lam, 2001; Yan et al., 2001),
suggesting the existence of a third BAFF receptor.

By screening an expression library of a B-cell line with undetectable
BCMA and low TACI expression, Thompson et al. (2001) isolated a cDNA
encoding the third BAFF receptor, BAFFR. Sequence analysis predicted
that the 184-amino acid transmembrane protein is 56% identical to the
mouse protein. TNF receptors typically contain multiple cysteine-rich
domains (CRDs), each with 6 cys residues. BAFFR, however, has only 1 CRD
that contains 4 extracellular cys residues. The C terminus of BAFFR has
a conserved region of 25 consecutive amino acids that is probably
involved in signal transduction. Northern blot analysis revealed
expression of a 4.5-kb BAFFR transcript in spleen and lymph node, with
lower levels in thymus and peripheral blood leukocytes. Binding analysis
indicated that BAFFR binds human and mouse BAFF but no other TNF ligand,
including APRIL. Soluble BAFFR inhibited BAFF-mediated costimulation of
B-cell proliferation. Thompson et al. (2001) concluded that BAFFR is the
principal receptor required for BAFF-mediated mature B-cell survival.

MAPPING

By homology to a BAC clone, Thompson et al. (2001) mapped the BAFFR gene
to chromosome 22q13.1-q13.31. They mapped the mouse Baffr gene to
chromosome 15.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 2 sibs with adult-onset common variable immunodeficiency-4 (CVID4;
613494), Warnatz et al. (2009) identified a homozygous deletion in the
BAFFR gene (606269.0001). Both patients had normal or increased numbers
of pre-B cell transition cells, but reduced class-switched memory B
cells and deficient IgG and IgM antibody production. The findings
indicated that BAFFR signals support the survival of transitional B
cells while differentiating into mature follicular B cells.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using PCR, Thompson et al. (2001) determined that the A/WySnJ strain of
mice, which resemble Baff knockout mice in their reduced number of
mature B cells, lack the intracellular signaling domain-encoding exon 3
of the Baffr gene. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that expression
of the Baffr extracellular and transmembrane domains, which are encoded
by exons 1 and 2, respectively, is maintained in this strain and that
these cells are able to bind Baff.

Using FACS analysis, Schiemann et al. (2001) showed that A/WySnJ mice
and Baff-deficient mice, but not Bcma -/- or wildtype mice, had
substantially reduced follicular and marginal zone splenic B cells. The
authors concluded that the Baff -/- phenotype is more severe than the
A/WySnJ mutation, but that both BAFF and BAFFR are involved in promoting
the survival and maturation of B2-type memory B cells.

Claudio et al. (2002) showed that bone marrow (BM) cells from Nfkb2
(164012)-deficient mice, but not Nfkb1 (164011)-deficient mice, failed
to increase relative and total IgD-positive transitional-1 (T1) stage B
cells in response to Baff. In vivo, however, Nfkb2-deficient mice did
generate mature B cells, but at reduced numbers. Mice of the aly/aly
strain, which are naturally deficient in Nik (604655), and mice of the
A/WySNJ strain, which have a mutation in Baffr, also failed to produce
T1 B cells in response to Baff. Baff stimulation enhanced expression of
Bcl2 (151430) in T1 B cells, thereby promoting B-cell survival, and
caused the processing of the p100 form of Nfkb2 to p52, which again
required Baffr and Nik, but not Nemo (IKKG; 300248). Immunoblot analysis
showed that BM cells contained primarily p100. In contrast, T1 splenic
cells had higher levels of p52, and even higher amounts of p52 were
found in T2/mature B-cell subsets. Claudio et al. (2002) concluded that
through sustained exposure, BAFF activates NFKB in B cells primarily via
processing of p100 and contributes to B-cell survival in vivo probably
from the T1 stage onwards.

Ju et al. (2006) crossed Baffr-mutant A/WySnJ mice with MRL-lpr mice, a
model of SLE, and found that the Baffr mutation inhibited B-cell
development in spleen and germinal center formation, but it had no
affect on autoantibody production, hypergammaglobulinemia, or immune
complex-mediated glomerulonephritis. Flow cytometric and ELISPOT
analyses demonstrated increased numbers of B cells secreting Ig in bone
marrow of Baffr-mutant MRL-lpr mice compared with Baffr-intact MRL-lpr
mice. Ju et al. (2006) proposed that BAFF may interact with other
unidentified receptors when BAFFR is mutated.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
IMMUNODEFICIENCY, COMMON VARIABLE, 4
TNFRSF13C, 24-BP DEL, NT89

In 2 sibs, born of consanguineous parents, with adult-onset common
variable immunodeficiency-4 (613494), Warnatz et al. (2009) identified a
homozygous 24-bp in-frame deletion (del89_96) in exon 2 of the TNFRSF13C
gene, resulting in the removal of a stretch of 8 hydrophobic amino acids
from the transmembrane region. The mutation was not found in 100
controls. The mutant protein was not identified in immortalized patient
lymphocytes, indicating that it was likely unstable. The proband was a
57-year-old man with a lifelong history of chronic sinusitis and
adult-onset recurrent pneumonia. His 80-year-old sister had an
unremarkable medical history except for a severe Herpes zoster infection
at age 70. Laboratory studies of both patients showed very low serum IgG
and IgM, but normal mucosal IgA. Both individuals also had a severe and
persistent B-cell lymphopenia and reduced numbers of class-switched
memory B cells. Surface protein phenotyping of the B cells showed a
developmental arrest after the transitional stage and before the cells
became mature follicular B cells. In vitro functional expression studies
showed that the mutant protein failed to bind BAFF (603969) and failed
to induce downstream NFKB (164011) processing. Warnatz et al. (2009)
emphasized the phenotypic differences in the patients, which suggested
residual sufficient potential to develop B cells that can differentiate
and provide host defense even in the absence of BAFFR function.

608757	TITLE *608757 CLP1, YEAST, HOMOLOG OF; CLP1
;;HEAB
HEAB/AF10 FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By cloning and sequencing a complex rearrangement involving chromosomes
10 and 11, Tanabe et al. (1996) obtained a partial genomic clone of
HEAB. By 5-prime and 3-prime RACE of several cDNA libraries, they
obtained a full-length cDNA. The 3-prime UTR contains 2 putative
polyadenylation sites. The deduced 425-amino acid protein is valine- and
leucine-rich and contains a domain sharing similarity with the
ATP/GTP-binding domain of ABC transporters. It also has a possible
tyrosine kinase phosphorylation site. Northern blot analysis detected a
major 2.0-kb transcript that was expressed ubiquitously, with highest
expression in testis and skeletal muscle. A 3.2-kb transcript was less
abundant in many tissues, with highest expression in peripheral blood
leukocytes and thymus.

De Vries et al. (2000) purified pre-mRNA cleavage factor IIm (CFIIm) of
the 3-prime end processing complex (see 604978) from HeLa cell nuclear
extracts and determined that it contains PCF11 (608876) and CLP1. By
searching databases and PCR of a HeLa cell cDNA library, they cloned
CLP1. The deduced protein contains highly conserved Walker A and B
motifs, which have been implicated in ATP/GTP binding.

GENE FUNCTION

De Vries et al. (2000) found that immunodepletion of CLP1 reduced
pre-mRNA cleavage activity, but not polyadenylation activity, in
purified HeLa cell CFIIm. CLP1 interacted with CFIm and
cleavage-polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF; see 606027),
suggesting that it bridges these two 3-prime end processing factors
within the cleavage complex.

Paushkin et al. (2004) identified and characterized the human tRNA
splicing endonuclease (see SEN2; 608753). They found that human
endonuclease complexes are associated with pre-mRNA 3-prime end
processing factors, including CLP1. Small interfering RNA-mediated
depletion of SEN2 led to defects in maturation of both pre-tRNA and
pre-mRNA. These findings demonstrated a link between pre-tRNA splicing
and pre-mRNA 3-prime end formation, suggesting that the endonuclease
subunits function in multiple RNA processing events.

Weitzer and Martinez (2007) applied a chromatographic approach that
resulted in the identification of the human protein CLP1, a component of
both tRNA splicing and mRNA 3-prime-end formation machineries, as the
RNA kinase responsible for phosphorylation of the 5-prime end of siRNAs
necessary for their subsequent incorporation into the RISC complex
(RNA-induced silencing complex). Weitzer and Martinez (2007) reported
that the kinase CLP1 phosphorylates and licenses synthetic siRNAs to
become assembled into RISC for subsequent target RNA cleavage. More
importantly, Weitzer and Martinez (2007) demonstrated that the
physiologic role of CLP1 as the RNA kinase that phosphorylates the
5-prime end of the 3-prime exon during human tRNA splicing, allowing the
subsequent ligation of both exon halves by an unknown tRNA ligase.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid analysis and FISH, Tanabe et al. (1996) mapped
the CLP1 gene to chromosome 11p12.

CYTOGENETICS

Tanabe et al. (1996) identified an invins(10;11)(p12;q23q12) and other
complex chromosomal rearrangements in a 2-year old boy with acute
monoblastic leukemia (AML-M5). Cloning of the proximal 10p breakpoint
showed that the MLL gene (159555) at chromosome 11q23 was fused to the
3-prime portion of AF10 (MLLT10; 602409) at chromosome 10p12. Cloning of
the telomeric 10p junction revealed that the 5-prime portion of AF10 was
fused with the HEAB gene. The 5-prime AF10/HEAB fusion transcript was
out of frame.

ANIMAL MODEL

Hanada et al. (2013) generated kinase-dead Clp1 mice that showed a
progressive loss of spinal motor neurons associated with axonal
degeneration in the peripheral nerves and denervation of neuromuscular
junctions, resulting in impaired motor function, muscle weakness,
paralysis, and fatal respiratory failure. Transgenic rescue experiments
showed that Clp1 functions in motor neurons. Mechanistically, loss of
Clp1 activity results in accumulation of a novel set of small RNA
fragments, derived from aberrant processing of tyrosine pre-transfer
RNA. These tRNA fragments sensitize cells to oxidative stress-induced
p53 (191170) activation and p53-dependent cell death. Genetic
inactivation of p53 rescues Clp1 kinase-dead mice from the motor neuron
loss, muscle denervation, and respiratory failure. Hanada et al. (2013)
concluded that their experiments uncovered a mechanistic link between
tRNA processing, formation of a new RNA species, and progressive loss of
lower motor neurons regulated by p53.

604067	TITLE *604067 REGULATOR OF G PROTEIN SIGNALING 9; RGS9
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the RGS family, such as RGS9, are signaling proteins that
suppress the activity of G proteins by promoting their deactivation.

CLONING

He et al. (1998) identified RGS9 as the mammalian rod outer segment
phototransduction GAP (GTPase-accelerating protein).

Burchett et al. (1998) isolated rat striatum cDNAs encoding several RGS
proteins, including RGS9.

By searching an EST database for homologs of rat RGS9, Granneman et al.
(1998) identified a human cDNA encoding an RGS9 isoform that they called
RGS9L. The predicted 674-amino acid human RGS9L protein contains an
N-terminal DEP (dishevelled, egl10, pleckstrin) domain, an RGS domain,
and a C-terminal region highly enriched in proline and serine residues.
Granneman et al. (1998) reported that the mouse and bovine retinal forms
of RGS9 isolated by He et al. (1998) represent an alternatively spliced
isoform, which they designated RGS9S. RGS9S lacks the C-terminal
proline-rich domain found in RGS9L. Northern blot analysis and nuclease
protection assays indicated that forebrain regions receiving dopamine
innervation, such as striatum, hypothalamus, and nucleus accumbens,
express RGS9L, while retina and pineal gland express RGS9S almost
exclusively. This tissue-specific splicing pattern appeared to be highly
conserved between human and rodents, suggesting cell-specific
differences in the function of these isoforms. RGS9S and RGS9L are
encoded by 9- and 2.5-kb mRNAs, respectively.

Zhang et al. (1999) cloned RGS9 variants, which they designated RGS9-1
and RGS9-2, from a retina cDNA library. Northern blot analysis indicated
that the major transcript in retina is a 9.5-kb mRNA encoding RGS9-1,
and the major transcript in brain is a 2.5-kb mRNA encoding RGS9-2. PCR
analysis of retina detected RGS9-2 at a much lower level than RGS9-1.
The RGS9-1 and RGS9-2 variants result from alternative splicing of exon
17 and encode proteins of 484 and 671 amino acids, respectively. Both
proteins share DEP, GGL (G protein gamma subunit-like), and RGS domains,
but RGS9-1 has an 18-residue C terminus, whereas RGS9-2 has a
205-residue, proline-rich C terminus. Zhang et al. (1999) also cloned
RGS9-1 and RGS9-2 variants with a 9-bp insertion at the 3-prime end of
exon 6, resulting in 3 additional amino acids in the proteins. Western
blot analysis of retina detected RGS9-1 at an apparent molecular mass of
58 kD, and Western blot analysis of brain detected RGS9-2 at an apparent
molecular mass of 70 kD, both in line with their expected masses.
Immunocytochemical analysis of bovine and human retina found strong RGS9
staining of cones, weak staining of rods, and punctate staining of
photoreceptor cell bodies. Weak staining was also detected in the inner
retina, possibly in amacrine cells.

GENE FUNCTION

He et al. (1998) found that the RGS domain of RGS9 accelerated GTP
hydrolysis by transducin, the visual G protein (see 189970).

Granneman et al. (1998) showed that, when expressed in mammalian cells,
RGS9L suppressed signaling mediated by Gi, the inhibitory GTP-binding
regulator of adenylate cyclase (see 139310). They stated that this was
probably due to RGS9L acting as a GAP.

Makino et al. (1999) reported that the GAP for transducin in rod
photoreceptors is a tight complex between RGS9 and the long splice
variant of G protein beta-5 (GNB5; 604447).

By coimmunoprecipitation analysis, Hu and Wensel (2002) determined that
bovine Rgs9 was associated with a heterotetrameric complex containing
R9ap (607814), Gnb5, and Gnat (see 139330) in detergent-solubilized rod
outer segment (ROS) membranes. R9ap interacted specifically with the
N-terminal domain of Rgs9. Hu and Wensel (2002) concluded that the
C-terminal transmembrane domain of R9ap functions as the membrane anchor
for the other largely soluble interacting partners. Hu et al. (2003)
determined that the formation of a membrane-bound complex with bovine
R9ap increased the GTPase-accelerating activity of Rgs9 by a factor of
4.

By single-cell RT-PCR and immunoprecipitation analysis, Cabrera-Vera et
al. (2004) detected Rgs9-2 and Gnb5 mRNA and protein complexes in rat
striatal cholinergic and gamma-aminobutyric acidergic neurons.
Introduction of bovine Rgs9 constructs through a patch pipette in these
cells showed that the RGS domain of Rgs9-2 modulated D2 dopamine
receptor (DRD2; 126450)-mediated inhibition of Cav2.2 (CACNA1B; 601012)
Ca(2+) channels. This modulation was blocked by the introduction of the
DEP-GGL domain of Rgs9-2. Rgs9 did not modulate the M2 muscarinic
receptor (CHRM2; 118493) linkage to Cav2.2 channels in the same cell.

GENE STRUCTURE

Zhang et al. (1999) determined that the RGS9 gene contains 19 exons and
spans more than 75 kb. The RGS9-1 transcript is derived from exons 1
through 17, and the RGS9-2 transcript is derived from exons 1 through
16, a short segment of exon 17, and exons 18 and 19. Exon 17 is
alternatively spliced in a cell-specific manner. Alternative splicing of
exon 6, resulting in a 9-bp insertion, occurs in some RGS9-1 and RGS9-2
variants.

Sierra et al. (2002) determined that the RGS9 gene contains 19 exons and
spans 91 kb.

MAPPING

By analysis of a radiation hybrid panel and by FISH, Granneman et al.
(1998) mapped the RGS9 gene to chromosome 17q23-q24. Zhang et al. (1999)
confirmed this localization by somatic cell hybrid analysis and FISH.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Nishiguchi et al. (2004) identified 4 unrelated Dutch patients with
bradyopsia (608415), each homozygous for a trp299-to-arg in the RGS9
gene (W299R; 604067.0001).

ANIMAL MODEL

Chen et al. (2000) generated mice deficient in Rgs9 by homologous
recombination. The rod outer segment membranes from mice lacking Rgs9
hydrolyzed GTP more slowly than rod outer segment membranes from control
mice. The G-beta-5-L protein that forms a complex with Rgs9 was absent
from Rgs9 -/- retinas, although G-beta-5-L mRNA was still present. The
flash responses of Rgs9 -/- rods rose normally, but recovered much more
slowly than normal. Chen et al. (2000) concluded that Rgs9, probably in
a complex with G-beta-5-L, is essential for acceleration of hydrolysis
of GTP by the rod transducin alpha subunit (139330) and for normal
recovery of the photoresponse.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
BRADYOPSIA
RGS9, TRP299ARG

In 4 unrelated Dutch patients with prolonged electroretinal response
suppression (PERRS; 608415), Nishiguchi et al. (2004) identified a
homozygous T-to-C transition at cDNA nucleotide 895 of RGS9 that
resulted in a tryptophan-to-arginine substitution at codon 299 (W299R).
The segregation of the W299R allele in the 4 families was consistent
with its pathogenicity. The electrophysiologic findings of W299R
homozygotes were similar to those in rgs9 knockout mice. W299 is one of
the most highly conserved residues in the catalytic RGS domain among RGS
family members in species ranging from C. elegans to human. The
substitution of a hydrophobic tryptophan with a positively charged
arginine residue was expected to disrupt the hydrophobic interactions of
the RGS domain. Nishiguchi et al. (2004) expressed the domain with the
W299R mutation and evaluated its function. The mutant was much less
soluble than the corresponding wildtype domain, and its ability to
stimulate the GTPase activity of transducin (see 139340) was about
20-fold lower than that of the wildtype domain.

615359	TITLE *615359 MISSING OOCYTE/MEIOSIS REGULATOR, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF; MIOS
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

In Drosophila, Mio is required for oocyte development (Iida and Lilly,
2004).

CLONING

Iida and Lilly (2004) cloned Drosophila Mio, and by database analysis,
they identified orthologs conserved from yeast to humans. The deduced
867-amino acid fly protein shares 30% identity with human MIOS. Mio
orthologs have an N-terminal WD40 repeat region and a C-terminal zinc
finger-like domain. In mammals, the WD40 repeat domain contains 6 WD40
repeats and in flies, only 4. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that
Mio was expressed in fly pro-oocyte nuclei in early prophase of meiosis
I.

MAPPING

Hartz (2013) mapped the MIOS gene to chromosome 7p21.3 based on an
alignment of the MIOS sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK000330) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

ANIMAL MODEL

In Drosophila, a single oocyte and 15 polyploid nurse cells develop
within a 16-cell germline cyst. Iida and Lilly (2004) found that 2
Drosophila strains with null mutations in the Mio gene were viable, but
female sterile. All cells of the female germline cyst were polyploid.
Mio was not required for oocyte specificity or for progression to
pachytene, but was required at later stages of oogenesis for meiotic
progression and maintenance of oocyte cell fate. Inhibition of
double-strand breaks during meiosis significantly suppressed the
16-nurse cell phenotype and associated developmental delay.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Certain cytokines of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) ligand family
induce apoptosis by binding to their respective death domain-containing
receptors. By searching an EST database for sequences related to the TNF
receptor-1 (TNFR1; 191190) death domain, Pan et al. (1997) identified a
cDNA encoding a protein that they designated 'death receptor-4' (DR4).
The predicted 468-amino acid DR4 protein contains a putative signal
peptide, 2 cysteine-rich pseudorepeats resembling corresponding regions
in TNFR1, DR3 (TNFRSF25; 603366), and FAS (134637), a transmembrane
domain, and an intracellular death domain. The death domain of DR4
shares 28% and 30% identity with those of DR3 and TNFR1, respectively.
Northern blot analysis revealed that DR4 is expressed as 2.6-, 4.6-, and
7.2-kb mRNAs in most human tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

Pan et al. (1997) found that, as with FAS, TNFR1, and DR3,
overexpression of DR4 induced apoptosis. However, unlike the other 3
death receptors, DR4 did not use FADD (602457) to transmit the death
signal, suggesting the use of distinct proximal signaling machinery.

MAPPING

By analysis of radiation hybrids, Marsters et al. (1997) mapped the DR4
gene to 8p21. The TRAIL (603598) receptor DR5 (603612), and 2 decoy
receptors for TRAIL, DCR1 (603613), and DCR2 (603614), are located in
the same region, suggesting that these receptors arose from recent gene
duplication events.

ANIMAL MODEL

Mice have only 1 Trail receptor, Trailr, that is equally related to the
human TRAIL receptors DR4 and DR5. Grosse-Wilde et al. (2008) generated
healthy and fertile mice lacking Trailr. Trailr-deficient mice showed no
increased susceptibility to primary skin tumors, but they exhibited
increased metastasis to lymph nodes. Adherent Trailr-expressing skin
carcinoma cells were resistant to Trail in vitro, but they could be
sensitized to Trail in vivo upon detachment by inactivation of the Erk
(see 601795) signaling pathway. Grosse-Wilde et al. (2008) concluded
that treatment of cancer patients with TRAILR agonists may reduce the
incidence of metastasis.

Finnberg et al. (2008) showed that monoallelic loss of Trailr was
sufficient to significantly decrease lymphoma-free survival and to
increase metastasis in a mouse model of Burkitt lymphoma (113970). Lack
of Trailr also increased bronchopneumonia and fibrosis in lung,
indicating that Trailr suppresses chronic inflammation. Mice lacking
Trailr were more susceptible to diethylnitrosamine-induced liver cancer.
Finnberg et al. (2008) concluded that TRAILR may function as an
inflammation and tumor suppressor in multiple tissues in vivo.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Interleukin-6 (147620), an important polypeptide hormone produced by
various cell types, plays a central role in a variety of biologic
phenomena. It modulates the immune response, is involved in the control
of body temperature, and in the liver regulates the synthesis of plasma
proteins, the 'acute phase' proteins. The IL6 receptor (IL6R; 147880)
consists of 2 chains, a ligand-binding chain and a glycoprotein
essential for transmembrane signaling which associates with the
ligand-binding chain only after binding of the ligand. Two different
IL6-responsive elements involved in the induction of acute phase
proteins (IL6REs) were identified, one in the promoter of the
haptoglobin and hemopexin genes and another in the promoter of the
alpha-2 macroglobulin gene. The haptoglobin and hemopexin gene IL6RE
sequence contains the recognition site for a family of nuclear proteins.
One of these proteins, IL6-dependent DNA-binding protein (IL6DBP), is
induced by IL6. It is identical to the liver-enriched transcriptional
activator protein of Descombes et al. (1990). This protein was found to
have a molecular weight of 32 kD and to stimulate transcription of
chimeric genes containing the albumin D-promoter elements both in vivo
and in vitro. LAP shared extensive sequence homology (71%) in its
DNA-binding and leucine zipper domains with CCAAT/enhancer-binding
protein (CEBPA; 116897). As a consequence, these 2 proteins show an
indistinguishable DNA-binding specificity and readily heterodimerize.
TCF5 is also identical to NF-IL6 (Akira et al., 1990). CEBPA and NF-IL6
(CEBPB, according to the nomenclature proposed by Cao et al., 1991) are
2 transcription factors belonging to a family of DNA-binding proteins
predominantly characterized by a leucine zipper motif that mediates
dimerization and a basic DNA binding domain. Notably, the CEBPA and
CEBPB genes contain no introns.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Although collagen is known to enhance hepatocyte differentiation and
hepatocytes produce collagen in vivo, the transcription factors
responsible for collagen type I gene expression in hepatic cells is not
known. Houglum et al. (1994) showed that LAP binds to the COL1A1
(120150) promoter at both reverse CCAAT motifs and activates
transcription. Furthermore, they found an upstream element, collagen
element I (-370/-344), which shares homology with the LAP binding
cis-element of the albumin promoter (9 of 13 bp). This collagen element
I stimulates transcription in both orientations and when placed in front
of either a homologous or a heterologous chimeric report construct.
Thus, LAP may be important in the expression of collagen and
differentiated hepatocytes through both the promoter and the newly
described upstream element.

Hormonal induction of growth-arrested 3T3-L1 preadipocytes rapidly
activates expression of CEBPB. Acquisition of DNA-binding activity by
CEBPB, however, is delayed until the cells synchronously enter the S
phase of mitotic clonal expansion (MCE). After MCE, CEBPB activates
expression of CEBPA and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma
(PPARG; 601487), which then transcriptionally activate genes that give
rise to the adipocyte phenotype. Zhang et al. (2004) studied the effect
on adipogenesis of the CEBPB dominant-negative mutation that blocks
CEBPB DNA binding by dimerizing with its leucine zipper. They provided
evidence that the dominant-negative mutant prevented entry of CEBPB into
the nucleus of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and thereby blocks MCE and
adipogenesis.

GENE FUNCTION

Menard et al. (2002) showed that Cebpb was expressed in mouse cortical
progenitor cells and could induce expression of a reporter gene
containing the minimal promoter of alpha-tubulin (TUBA1A; 602529), a
neuron-specific gene. Gel and supershift assays confirmed that Cebpb
bound the alpha-tubulin promoter in embryonic mouse brain. Menard et al.
(2002) also showed that Cebpb was a downstream target of Mek (see
176872), which activated Rsk (see 601684) to phosphorylate Cebpb.

By computational analysis of the expression patterns of thousands of
genes across hundreds of tumor specimens, Lamb et al. (2003) found that
CEBP-beta participates in the consequences of cyclin D1 (CCND1; 168461)
overexpression. Functional analysis confirmed the involvement of CEBPB
in the regulation of genes affected by cyclin D1 and established CEBPB
as a principal effector of cyclin D1 activity in human cancer.

By expression profiling of ALK (105590)-positive anaplastic large cell
lymphomas (ALCLs), Piva et al. (2006) identified a large group of
ALK-regulated genes. Functional RNA interference screening on a set of
these transcriptional targets revealed that CEBPB and BCL2A1 (601056)
were absolutely necessary to induce cell transformation and/or to
sustain growth and survival of ALK-positive ALCL cells.

Dudaronek et al. (2007) showed that Ifnb (147720) induced expression of
Lip, a truncated, dominant-negative isoform of Cebpb, and suppressed
active simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) replication in macaque
macrophages. In a human monocyte cell line, IFNB induced phosphorylation
of CUGBP1 (601074) and formation of CUGBP1-CEBPB mRNA complexes.
Depletion of Cugbp1 in macaque macrophages via small interfering RNA
showed that Cugbp1 was required for Ifnb-mediated induction of Lip and
for Ifnb-mediated suppression of SIV replication. Dudaronek et al.
(2007) concluded that CUGBP1 is a downstream effector of IFNB signaling
in primary macrophages that plays an important role in innate immune
responses controlling acute human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or SIV
replication in brain.

Using a cDNA complementation screen, Kinoshita and Taguchi (2008)
identified NFIL6 as a host molecule that rendered primary CD4
(186940)-positive T cells permissive for HIV-1 replication. They found
that NFIL6 regulated HIV-1 replication during reverse transcription
after infection by binding to and inactivating the cytidine deaminase
activity of APOBEC3G (607113) and also during gene transcription after
integration. Binding and inactivation of APOBEC3G required ser288 in
NFIL6. Overexpression of NFIL6 in nonpermissive cells enhanced HIV-1
replication, even in the absence of the HIV-1 protein Vif. Kinoshita and
Taguchi (2008) proposed that NFIL6 evolved to negatively regulate
APOBEC3G to limit DNA mutations, but that this mechanism backfires
during HIV-1 infection, where it facilitates viral reverse transcription
and replication.

Ishikawa et al. (2008) demonstrated that cAMP-induced binding of
CEBP-beta to multiple motifs in the CYP19A1 (107910) promoter I.3/II
region is a critical mechanism regulating aromatase expression in
leiomyoma (see 150699) smooth muscle cells in primary culture. The
authors concluded that definition of this mechanism further may assist
in designing inhibitors of aromatase specific for leiomyoma tissue.

Kajimura et al. (2009) demonstrated that PRDM16 (605557) forms a
transcriptional complex with the active form of C/EBP-beta, acting as a
critical molecular unit that controls the cell fate switch from
myoblastic precursors to brown fat cells. Forced expression of PRDM16
and C/CEBP-beta was sufficient to induce a fully functional brown fat
program in naive fibroblastic cells, including skin fibroblasts from
mouse and man. Transplantation of fibroblasts expressing these 2 factors
into mice gave rise to an ectopic fat pad with the morphologic and
biochemical characteristics of brown fat. Like endogenous brown fat,
this synthetic brown fat tissue acted as a sink for glucose uptake, as
determined by positron emission tomography with fluorodeoxyglucose.
Kajimura et al. (2009) concluded that the PRMD16-C/EBP-beta complex
initiates brown fat formation from myoblastic precursors and may provide
opportunities for the development of therapeutics for obesity and type 2
diabetes.

Carro et al. (2010) used reverse engineering and an unbiased
interrogation of a glioma-specific regulatory network to reveal the
transcriptional module that activates expression of mesenchymal genes in
malignant glioma. Two transcription factors, C/EBP-beta and STAT3
(102582), emerged as synergistic initiators and master regulators of
mesenchymal transformation. Ectopic coexpression of C/EBP-beta and STAT3
reprogrammed neural stem cells along the aberrant mesenchymal lineage,
whereas elimination of the 2 factors in glioma cells led to collapse of
the mesenchymal signature and reduced tumor aggressiveness. In human
glioma, expression of C/EBP-beta and STAT3 correlated with mesenchymal
differentiation and predicted poor clinical outcome. Carro et al. (2010)
concluded that the activation of a small regulatory module is necessary
and sufficient to initiate and maintain an aberrant phenotypic state in
cancer cells.

Bostrom et al. (2010) found that expression of Cebpb in mice was
significantly downregulated during cardiac hypertrophy induced by
exercise endurance training, but not during pathologic cardiac
hypertrophy. Knockdown of Cebpb by small interfering RNA in primary rat
cardiomyocytes increased cell size, the rate of protein synthesis, and
cell number. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis showed that Cebpb interacted
with Srf (600589), and knockdown of Cebpb increased binding of Srf to
the promoters of the critical cardiac genes alpha-MHC (MYH6; 160710) and
Gata4 (600576). Expression of Cited4 (606815) increased robustly in
exercised hearts, and its expression level was altered by Cebpb gain or
loss of function in vitro. Knockdown of Cited4 completely abolished the
effect of Cebpb reduction on cardiomyocyte proliferation.

Overexpression of P-cadherin (CDH3; 114021) has been associated with
proliferative lesions of high histologic grade, decreased cell polarity,
and poor survival of patients with breast cancer. In vitro studies
showed that it can be upregulated by the antiestrogen drug ICI 182,780,
suggesting that the lack of estrogen receptor-alpha (ESRA; 133430)
signaling may responsible for the aberrant P-cadherin overexpression and
for its role in inducing breast cancer cell invasion and migration.
Albergaria et al. (2010) showed that ICI 182,780 was able to increase
P-cadherin promoter activity, inducing high levels of the active
chromatin marker H3 lysine-4 dimethylation (H3K4me2). Albergaria et al.
(2010) also showed that CEBPB was able to upregulate P-cadherin promoter
activity in breast cancer cells. Moreover, the expression of P-cadherin
and CEBPB were highly associated in human breast carcinomas and linked
with a worse prognosis in breast cancer patients. The authors concluded
that epigenetic upregulation of P-cadherin by ICI 182,780 in MCF-7/AZ
breast cancer cells occurs through chromatin remodeling at the CDH3
promoter, bringing forward the growing evidence that ESRA signaling
abrogation by antiestrogens may be able to induce the expression of
ESRA-repressed genes which, in the appropriate cell biology context, may
contribute to a breast cancer cell invasion phenotype.

MAPPING

By analysis of human/mouse somatic cell hybrids, Szpirer et al. (1991)
assigned the TCF5 gene to human chromosome 20. By corresponding studies
in rat/mouse hybrids, they localized the gene to rat chromosome 3.
Hendricks-Taylor et al. (1992) mapped the human CEBPB gene to chromosome
20 by Southern blot analysis of Chinese hamster/human and mouse/human
somatic cell hybrids and regionalized the gene to 20q13.1 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization. Using interspecific backcross
analysis, Jenkins et al. (1995) showed that the Cebpb gene maps to mouse
chromosome 2.

EVOLUTION

Lynch et al. (2011) showed that amino acid changes in the transcription
factor CEBPB in the stem lineage of placental mammals changed the way it
responds to cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA; see 176911) signaling. By
functionally analyzing resurrected ancestral proteins, they identified 3
amino acid substitutions in an internal regulatory domain of CEBPB that
are responsible for the novel function. These amino acid substitutions
reorganize the location of key phosphorylation sites, introducing a new
site and removing 2 ancestral sites, reversing the response of CEBPB to
GSK-3-beta (605004)-mediated phosphorylation from repression to
activation. Lynch et al. (2011) concluded that changing the response of
transcription factors to signaling pathways can be an important
mechanism of gene regulatory evolution.

ANIMAL MODEL

To determine the role of C/EBP-beta in the regenerating liver, Greenbaum
et al. (1998) examined the regenerative response after partial
hepatectomy in mice that had a targeted disruption of the gene.
Posthepatectomy, hepatocyte DNA synthesis was decreased to 25% of normal
in the homozygous deficient mice. The reduced regenerative response was
associated with a prolonged period of hypoglycemia that was independent
of expression of C/EBP-alpha protein and gluconeogenic genes. The
homozygous C/EBP-beta-deficient livers showed reduced expression of
immediate-early growth-control genes. This study demonstrated that C/EBP
is required for a normal proliferative response.

Wang et al. (2000) performed detailed biochemical experiments on
CEBPB-deficient mice. They found that the deletion caused decreased
plasma free fatty acid levels and increased insulin signal transduction,
specifically in skeletal muscle, and that both contribute to increased
whole-body insulin sensitivity.

Croniger et al. (2001) noted that there are 2 distinct phenotypes, A and
B, in Cebpb-deficient mice. Phenotype A mice survive to adulthood but
have hypoglycemia as well as lipid, amino acid, and immunologic
deficiencies. Phenotype B mice survive only 2 hours after birth and
display profound hypoglycemia in spite of above normal levels of hepatic
glycogen. Croniger et al. (2001) detailed the metabolic consequences in
Cebpb-deficient mice. In these mice, relatively small changes in the
rate of hepatic cAMP degradation and a shift in the pattern of protein
kinase A (PKA; see 176911) isoform gene expression result in a lower
concentration of cAMP in the liver. More cAMP is required to activate
PKA, and the result is a failure of the normal response to glucagon.

Upon activation by liver injury, hepatic stellate cells produce
excessive fibrous tissue leading to cirrhosis. Buck et al. (2001) found
that the hepatotoxin CCl4 induced activation of Rsk (601684),
phosphorylation of Cebpb on thr217 (Cebpb-Pthr217), and proliferation of
stellate cells in normal mice, but it caused apoptosis of these cells in
Cebpb -/- or Cebpb-ala217 (a dominant-negative nonphosphorylatable
mutant) transgenic mice. Both Cebpb-Pthr217 and the phosphorylation
mimicked Cebpb-glu217, but not Cebpb-ala217; were associated with
procaspase-1 (147678) and -8 (601763) in vivo and in vitro; and
inhibited activation of these procaspases. These data suggested that
Cebpb phosphorylation on thr217 creates a functional XEXD caspase
substrate/inhibitor box (K-phospho-T(217)VD) that is mimicked by
Cebpb-glu217 (KE(217)VD). Cebpb -/- and Cebpb-ala217 stellate cells were
rescued from apoptosis by the cell-permeant KE(217)VD tetrapeptide or
Cebpb-glu217.

A surge of luteinizing hormone (LH; see 152780) from the pituitary gland
triggers ovulation, oocyte maturation, and luteinization for successful
reproduction in mammals. Because the signaling molecules RAS (190020)
and ERK1/2 (see 601795) are activated by an LH surge in granulosa cells
of preovulatory follicles, Fan et al. (2009) disrupted Erk1/2 in mouse
granulosa cells and provided in vivo evidence that these kinases are
necessary for LH-induced oocyte resumption of meiosis, ovulation, and
luteinization. In addition, biochemical analyses and selected disruption
of the Cebpb gene in granulosa cells demonstrated that C/EBP-beta is a
critical downstream mediator of ERK1/2 activation. Thus, Fan et al.
(2009) concluded that ERK1/2 and C/EBP-beta constitute an in vivo
LH-regulated signaling pathway that controls ovulation- and
luteinization-related events.

Bostrom et al. (2010) stated that homozygous Cebpb deletion in mice
results in pre- and perinatal lethality, but that Cebpb +/- mice are
relatively normal. They found increased heart weight and cardiomyocyte
hypertrophy in Cebpb +/- mice, similar to that found in wildtype mice
following endurance training. Cebpb +/- mice displayed a clear increase
in exercise capacity at baseline, but no hypertrophy following training.
Cultured cardiomyocytes from Cebpb +/- mice proliferated more readily
than wildtype cardiomyocytes. Cebpb +/- mice also showed resistance to
pathologic cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction caused by pressure
overload. Knockdown of Cebpb in zebrafish caused an increase in
cardiomyocyte cell number, but no change in cardiomyocyte size. Bostrom
et al. (2010) concluded that reduced CEBPB activity during exercise
contributes to physiologic cardiac hypertrophy.

608786	TITLE *608786 PYRUVATE CARBOXYLASE; PC
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Pyruvate carboxylase (EC 6.4.1.1) is a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial
enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to oxaloacetate. It is
a key regulatory enzyme in gluconeogenesis, lipogenesis, and
neurotransmitter synthesis. Human PC is a tetramer composed of identical
subunits (Barden et al., 1974).

CLONING

Using an oligonucleotide probe specific for the amino acid sequence at
the biotin site of pyruvate carboxylase to screen a human liver cDNA
library, Freytag and Collier (1984) isolated 3 cDNA clones for pyruvate
carboxylase. Northern blot analysis detected a 4.2-kb mRNA.

Wexler et al. (1994) isolated a PC cDNA, which encodes a deduced
1,178-amino acid protein with a molecular mass of 129.6 kD for the
full-length precursor and 127.4 kD for the mature apoprotein. Northern
blot analysis demonstrated that the highest level of PC mRNA is in the
liver. Based on homology with other biotin-containing proteins, the ATP,
pyruvate, and biotin-binding sites were identified. MacKay et al. (1994)
isolated and cloned PC cDNA from human kidney.

Carbone et al. (1998) characterized the PC gene by PCR amplification,
subcloning, and sequencing.

GENE STRUCTURE

Carbone et al. (1998) determined that the PC gene contains 19 exons
spanning approximately 16 kb of genomic DNA.

MAPPING

Using Southern blotting of human-Chinese hamster somatic cell hybrids,
Freytag and Collier (1984) localized the PC gene to the long arm of
chromosome 11.

Rochelle et al. (1992) indicated that the corresponding locus in the
mouse is located on chromosome 19 near the centromere. Comparative
mapping suggested that the human PC locus is in the proximal part of
11q, perhaps 11q12-q13.

Using fluorescence in situ hybridization to normal chromosomes and
chromosomes carrying the FRA11A (136560) fragile site, Walker et al.
(1995) mapped PC to 11q13, distal to FRA11A, thus localizing it to
11q13.4-q13.5. Perucca-Lostanlen et al. (1997) used fluorescence in situ
hybridization with yeast artificial chromosome and cosmid probes on
metaphase chromosomes of patients expressing the fragile site to show
that FRA11A is situated centromeric to ACTN3 (102574) and telomeric to
D11S913, these markers being within an interval of approximately 1 Mb in
the 11q13.3 region.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 11 Ojibwa and 2 Cree patients with group A pyruvate carboxylase
deficiency (266150), Carbone et al. (1998) identified a missense
mutation in the PC gene (608786.0001). In 2 brothers of Micmac origin,
they identified a transversion mutation in the PC gene (608786.0002).
Carrier frequency was estimated to be as high as 1 in 10 in some
groupings. The 2 point mutations were located in the region of homology
conserved among yeast, rat, and human PC, in the vicinity of the
carboxylation domain of the enzyme.

NOMENCLATURE

Brun et al. (1999) referred to pyruvate carboxylase as a key enzyme in
the gluconeogenesis and anaplerotic metabolic pathways. Anaplerotic is a
somewhat archaic term derived from the Greek stems ana, meaning 'for
up,' and plerotic, meaning 'for filling.' The adjective anaplerotic
refers to a reaction that effects best the formation of an intermediate
of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, in order to maintain the intracellular
concentration of it, or of another such intermediate, as those
intermediates are utilized for biosynthesis.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
PYRUVATE CARBOXYLASE DEFICIENCY
PC, ALA610THR

In 11 Ojibwa and 2 Cree Amerindian patients with simple pyruvate
carboxylase deficiency (266150), Carbone et al. (1998) identified a
homozygous 1828G-A transition in the PC gene, resulting in an
ala610-to-thr (A610T) substitution.

.0002
PYRUVATE CARBOXYLASE DEFICIENCY
PC, MET743ILE

In 2 Micmac brothers from Nova Scotia with simple pyruvate carboxylase
deficiency (266150), Carbone et al. (1998) identified a 2229G-T
transversion in the PC gene, resulting in a met743-to-ile (M743I)
substitution in the carboxylation domain of the enzyme.

.0003
PYRUVATE CARBOXYLASE DEFICIENCY
PC, VAL145ALA

In affected members of a consanguineous family with PC deficiency
(266150), Wexler et al. (1998) identified a homozygous 434T-C transition
in the PC gene, resulting in a val145-to-ala (V145A) substitution. Both
parents were heterozygous for the mutation. The patients were found to
have low PC activity (range 2-25% of control) in blood lymphocytes and
skin fibroblasts associated with either diminished or normal protein
levels.

.0004
PYRUVATE CARBOXYLASE DEFICIENCY
PC, ARG451CYS

In an affected brother and sister from a consanguineous family with PC
deficiency (266150), Wexler et al. (1998) identified a homozygous
1351C-T transition the PC gene, resulting in an arg451-to-cys (R451C)
substitution. Both parents were heterozygous for the mutation. Both
mutations occurred in relatively conserved amino acid residues and were
located in the biotin carboxylase domain.

.0005
PYRUVATE CARBOXYLASE DEFICIENCY
PC, IVS15, 4-BP DEL, TAGG, +2-5

In 2 brothers with severe (type B) pyruvate carboxylase deficiency
(266150), Carbone et al. (2002) found compound heterozygosity for 2
mutations in the PC gene: a TAGG deletion at the exon 15/intron 15
splice site (IVS15+2-5delTAGG) and a dinucleotide deletion in exon 16
(2491-2492delGT; 608786.0006). By RT-PCR and sequencing of aberrant
transcripts, Carbone et al. (2002) found that the splice site mutation
resulted in the retention of intron 15 during pre-mRNA splicing. In
addition, both deletions were predicted to result in a frameshift to
generate a premature termination codon such that the encoded mRNA would
be subject to nonsense-mediated decay. In 1 brother, the diagnosis was
made at the age of 4 hours and death occurred at 7 weeks; in the younger
brother, the diagnosis was made in the fetus and death was in the
neonatal period.

PC, ARG156GLN

In a patient with type A PC deficiency (266150), Monnot et al. (2009)
identified a homozygous 467G-A transition in exon 3 of the PC gene,
resulting in an arg156-to-gln (R156Q) substitution in the biotin
carboxylase domain. The mutation had no detectable effect on mRNA size
or amount. Monnot et al. (2009) observed that the relatively milder type
A phenotype results from missense mutations in the PC gene.

.0008
PYRUVATE CARBOXYLASE DEFICIENCY
PC, ARG583LEU

In a patient with type B PC deficiency (266150), Monnot et al. (2009)
identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the PC gene: a
1748G-T transversion in exon 12, resulting in an arg583-to-leu (R583L)
substitution in the carboxytransferase domain, and a 1-bp duplication in
exon 17 (2876dupT; 608786.0009), resulting in a frameshift,
nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, and no functional protein. The R583L
mutation had no detectable effect on mRNA size or amount. Monnot et al.
(2009) commented that patients with the relatively more severe type B
tend to have at least 1 truncating mutation in the PC gene.

602539	TITLE *602539 MITOGEN-ACTIVATED KINASE KINASE KINASE 3; MAP3K3
;;MAP/ERK KINASE KINASE 3; MEKK3;;
MAPKKK3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Ellinger-Ziegelbauer et al. (1997) cloned a human kinase cDNA from an
activated peripheral blood T lymphocyte cDNA library and found that it
encodes the homolog of mouse Mekk3. Human MEKK3 (MAP3K3) is a 626-amino
acid polypeptide that is 96.5% identical to mouse Mekk3. Its catalytic
domain is closely related to those of several other kinases, including
mouse Mekk2 (MAP3K2; 609487), tobacco NPK, and yeast Ste11. Northern
blot analysis revealed a 4.6-kb MEKK3 transcript that appears to be
ubiquitously expressed.

GENE FUNCTION

Ellinger-Ziegelbauer et al. (1997) showed that MEKK3 directly regulates
the stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) and extracellular
signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) pathways by activating SEK
(601335) and MEK1/2 (176872, 601263), respectively; it does not regulate
the p38 pathway (see 600289). In cotransfection assays, MEKK3 enhanced
transcription from a nuclear factor kappa-B (NFKB; 164011,
164012)-dependent reporter gene, consistent with a role in the SAPK
pathway.

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis of a mouse T-cell cDNA library, Uhlik et al.
(2003) showed that a C-terminal fragment of mouse Osm (CCM2; 607929)
interacted with Mekk3, which activates p38 in response to
sorbitol-induced hyperosmotic conditions. Mekk3 and Osm colocalized in
the cytoplasmic compartment of cotransfected cells, and the Mekk3-Osm
complex was recruited to Rac1 (602048)- and cytoskeletal actin (see
102560)-containing membrane ruffles in response to sorbitol treatment.
Protein interaction assays showed that Osm interacted directly with the
Mekk3 substrate Mkk3 (MAP2K3; 602315), with actin, and with both GDP-
and GTP-loaded Rac1. Uhlik et al. (2003) concluded that the
RAC1-OSM-MEKK3-MKK3 complex is required for regulation of p38 activity
in response to osmotic shock.

Channavajhala et al. (2005) showed that cotransfection of KSR2 (610737)
with MEKK3 in HEK293T cells significantly reduced MEKK3-mediated ERK
activation but did not affect ERK activation by other MAP3Ks. KSR2 also
significantly reduced MEKK3-induced NF-kappa-B activation to near
background levels in the IL1B (147720)-mediated proinflammatory pathway
and downregulated MEKK3-induced IL8 (146930) production in response to
IL1B stimulation. Channavajhala et al. (2005) concluded that KSR2
specifically regulates the activity of MEKK3 and COT (MAP3K8; 191195)
but not other members of the MAP3K family.

MAPPING

MAP3K3 is contiguously distal to LYK5 (608626) on chromosome 17
(Puffenberger et al., 2007).

ANIMAL MODEL

The early development of blood vessels consists of 2 phases,
vasculogenesis and angiogenesis, which involve distinct and overlapping
molecular regulators. To define the intracellular signal transduction
pathways involved in these processes, Yang et al. (2000) disrupted the
Mekk3 gene in mice. Mekk3 -/- embryos died at approximately embryonic
day (E) 11, displaying disruption of blood vessel development and the
structural integrity of the yolk sac. Angiogenesis was blocked at
approximately E9.5 in mutant embryos. Mekk3 disruption did not alter the
expression of the genes encoding Vegf1 (VEGF; 192240), angiopoietin
(ANGPT1; 601667), or their receptors. The development of embryonic, but
not maternal, blood vessels in the placentas of Mekk3 -/- embryos was
impaired, revealing an intrinsic defect in Mekk3 -/- endothelial cells.
Moreover, Mekk3 activated myocyte-specific enhancer factor 2C (MEF2C;
600662), a transcription factor crucial for early embryonic
cardiovascular development through the p38 mitogen-activated protein
kinase cascade. Yang et al. (2000) concluded that Mekk3 is necessary for
blood vessel development and may be a possible target for drugs that
control angiogenesis.

605528	TITLE *605528 NEURAMINIDASE 2; NEU2
;;SIALIDASE 2; SIAL2;;
SIALIDASE, CYTOSOLIC
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Sialidases, also known as neuraminidases, are glycohydrolytic enzymes
that cleave sialic acid residues from the oligosaccharide components of
glycoconjugates.

CLONING

Using a hamster Sial3 probe, Monti et al. (1999) identified the gene
encoding sialidase-2, which they designated NEU2, from a human genomic
library. The 2 putative exons of NEU2 encode a deduced 380-amino acid
protein with a calculated molecular mass of 42.23 kD. The NEU2 protein
has significant homology with the mammalian, viral, and bacterial
sialidases. It shares over 72% similarity with the hamster and rat
cytosolic sialidases and over 42% similarity with human NEU1 (608272).
NEU2 contains a potential N-linked glycosylation site, 2 aspartic acid
block consensus sequences, and an N-terminal F/YRIP sequence motif which
is part of the active site of other sialidase enzymes. Monti et al.
(1999) hypothesized that NEU2 has a cytosolic localization because it
does not contain a cleavage site, transmembrane domain, or targeting
motifs. The promoter region of NEU2 contains a classic TATA box, a CCAAT
box, 3 GATA boxes, 2 CACCC boxes, and 4 E-box sequences that are
consensus binding sites for muscle-specific transcription factors. Using
Northern blot analysis, Monti et al. (1999) detected a 4-kb NEU2
transcript in skeletal muscle only. Using RT-PCR, they also detected
expression in fetal liver and in an embryonic carcinoma cell line.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization and radiation hybrid analysis,
Monti et al. (1999) mapped the NEU2 gene to chromosome 2q37 between
markers D2S331 and D2S345.

607130	TITLE *607130 REGULATORY ASSOCIATED PROTEIN OF MTOR; RPTOR
;;RAPTOR;;
KIAA1303
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

MTOR (FRAP1; 601231), the target of the immunosuppressive drug
rapamycin, is the central component of a nutrient- and hormone-sensitive
signaling pathway that regulates cell growth. Kim et al. (2002) reported
that MTOR forms a stoichiometric complex with RAPTOR, an evolutionarily
conserved protein with at least 2 roles in the MTOR pathway. They cloned
the full-length cDNA for RAPTOR, which contains an open reading frame
encoding a protein with 1,335 amino acids and a predicted molecular mass
of 149 kD. A previously identified partial cDNA, KIAA1303 (Nagase et
al., 2000), is contained within the RAPTOR cDNA. All RAPTOR homologs
have a novel N-terminal domain the authors called RNC (RAPTOR N-terminal
conserved) that consists of 3 blocks with at least 67 to 79% sequence
similarity and is predicted to have a high propensity to form alpha
helices. Following the RNC domain, all RAPTOR homologs have 3 HEAT
repeats, which are followed by 7 WD40 repeats in the C-terminal third of
the protein. Northern blot analysis showed that RAPTOR is expressed in
all tissues in a pattern similar to that of MTOR, with the highest
levels of both mRNAs in skeletal muscle, brain, kidney, and placenta.

Independently, Hara et al. (2002) also cloned the RAPTOR gene. They
found that RAPTOR is a 150-kD MTOR-binding protein that also binds
eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein-1 (4EBP1; 602223) and
p70 S6 kinase-alpha (S6K1; 608938). They determined that mouse and human
RAPTOR share about 97% amino acid identity.

GENE FUNCTION

Kim et al. (2002) showed that RAPTOR has a positive role in
nutrient-stimulated signaling to the downstream effector S6K1,
maintenance of cell size, and MTOR protein expression. The association
of RAPTOR with MTOR also negatively regulates the MTOR kinase activity.
Conditions that repress the pathway, such as nutrient deprivation and
mitochondrial uncoupling, stabilize the MTOR-RAPTOR association and
inhibit MTOR kinase activity. The authors proposed that RAPTOR is a
component of the MTOR pathway that, through its association with MTOR,
regulates cell size in response to nutrient levels.

Hara et al. (2002) showed that the binding of RAPTOR to MTOR is
necessary for the MTOR-catalyzed phosphorylation of 4EBP1 in vitro and
that it strongly enhances the MTOR kinase activity toward p70-alpha.
Rapamycin or amino acid withdrawal increased, whereas insulin strongly
inhibited, the recovery of 4EBP1 and RAPTOR on 7-methyl-GTP sepharose.
Partial inhibition of RAPTOR expression by RNA interference reduced
MTOR-catalyzed 4EBP1 phosphorylation in vitro. RNA interference of C.
elegans Raptor yielded an array of phenotypes that closely resembled
those produced by inactivation of CE-Tor. Thus, the authors concluded
that RAPTOR is an essential scaffold for the MTOR-catalyzed
phosphorylation of 4EBP1 and mediates TOR action in vivo.

The multiprotein mTORC1 protein kinase complex (see 601231) is the
central component of a pathway that promotes growth in response to
insulin, energy levels, and amino acids and is deregulated in common
cancers. Sancak et al. (2008) found that the Rag proteins, a family of 4
related small guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) (RAGA (612194), RAGB
(300725), RAGC (608267), and RAGD (608268)) interact with mTORC1 in an
amino acid-sensitive manner and are necessary for the activation of the
mTORC1 pathway by amino acids. Coimmunoprecipitation assays indicated
that RAPTOR is the key mediator of the Rag-mTORC1 interaction.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Kim et al. (2002) mapped the RPTOR gene to
chromosome 17q25.3.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a dataset of 233 parent-offspring trios with psoriasis (see 177900),
Capon et al. (2004) analyzed 8 representative SNPs selected from 2
psoriasis susceptibility (PSORS2; 602723) association peaks previously
identified by Helms et al. (2003) encompassing the SLC9AR1 (604990)-NAT9
genes and the third intron of the RAPTOR gene, respectively. They found
evidence for association only at RAPTOR dbSNP rs2019154 (p = 0.027).
Restricting the analysis to 116 trios with a well-documented family
history of psoriasis increased the significance of the association for 3
RAPTOR SNPs, with rs2019154 yielding a p value of 0.008.

In a study of 579 pedigrees with psoriasis, Stuart et al. (2006) found
no evidence for a disease association with 3 SNPS in the RAPTOR gene.

607023	TITLE *607023 POLO-LIKE KINASE 2; PLK2
;;SERUM-INDUCIBLE KINASE; SNK
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Serum-inducible kinase is a member of the 'polo' family of
serine/threonine protein kinases that have a role in normal cell
division.

CLONING

Liby et al. (2001) identified SNK in a database search of sequences with
significant homology to the polo kinases PRK (CNK; 602913) and PLK
(602098). The deduced 685-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular
mass of about 78 kD and contains an ATP-binding motif within the kinase
domain and a conserved polo box. SNK shares about 97% sequence identity
with the mouse and rat proteins. Dot blot analysis indicated a
ubiquitous low level of SNK expression. Highest expression was found in
adult testis, spleen, putamen, and occipital lobe, and in fetal lung,
spleen, kidney, and heart.

GENE FUNCTION

By Northern blot analysis, Liby et al. (2001) found rapid induction of
SNK mRNA in human lung fibroblasts upon reintroduction of serum
following 36 hours of serum deprivation.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the SNK
gene to chromosome 5 (TMAP WI-13092).

608005	TITLE *608005 SIL1, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; SIL1
;;BIP-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN; BAP
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SIL1 is a resident endoplasmic reticulum (ER) glycoprotein that
interacts with the ATPase domain of BIP (HSPA5; 138120) and enhances
nucleotide exchange.

CLONING

By searching EST databases for sequences showing similarity to yeast
Sil1, Tyson and Stirling (2000) identified human SIL1. The deduced
protein contains 461 amino acids.

Using an ATPase-defective rodent Bip mutant as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid
screen of a liver cDNA library, followed by database screening, Chung et
al. (2002) cloned SIL1, which they called BAP. The deduced 461-amino
acid protein contains an N-terminal ER targeting sequence, 2 putative
N-glycosylation sites, and a C-terminal ER retention signal. BAP mRNA
contains 2 polyadenylation sequences. BAP shares 29% homology with
Hsp70-binding protein-1 (HSPBP1; 612939), which inhibits the ATPase
activity of Hsp70 (see 140550). Northern blot analysis detected a 1.8-kb
transcript in all tissues examined, with highest levels in liver,
placenta, and kidney. Immunolocalization found epitope-tagged BAP
colocalized with endogenous GRP94 (191175) in the ER of transfected
COS-1 cells. Western blot analysis and endoglycosidase treatment
revealed that endogenous BAP is an N-linked glycoprotein with an
apparent molecular mass of about 54 kD.

GENE STRUCTURE

Takahata et al. (2010) stated that the SIL1 gene contains 10 exons.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the SIL1
gene to chromosome 5 (TMAP stSG44562). Takahata et al. (2010) noted that
the SIL1 gene maps to chromosome 5q31.

GENE FUNCTION

Tyson and Stirling (2000) determined that yeast Sil1 interacts directly
with the ATPase domain of Bip. They found that upregulation of Sil1 was
associated with the constitutively induced unfolded protein response
resulting from deletion of Lhs1, an ER resident heat shock protein
homologous to ORP150 (HYOU1; 601746).

By Northern blot analysis, Chung et al. (2002) detected expression of
BAP in the same tissues that express BIP. In vitro binding assays
between BAP, wildtype rodent Bip, and ATPase domain mutants of rodent
Bip showed that BAP bound more stably to the mutants than to wildtype
Bip. BAP stimulated the ATPase activity of BIP 2-fold, and addition of
both BAP and the ER protein ERDJ4 (DNAJB9; 602634) stimulated the ATPase
activity of BIP 4-fold. Chung et al. (2002) concluded that BAP is a
nucleotide exchange factor for BIP.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Marinesco-Sjogren syndrome (MSS; 248800) is an autosomal recessive
disorder characterized by cerebellar ataxia, progressive myopathy, and
cataracts. Anttonen et al. (2005) identified mutations in the SIL1 gene
in 8 families with MSS. The finding of mutations in the SIL1 gene in
affected individuals and the similar spatial and temporal patterns of
tissue expression of SIL1 and HSPA5, the heat-shock protein-70 (HSP70)
chaperone for which SIL1 is a nucleotide exchange factor, suggested that
disturbed SIL1-HSPA5 interaction and protein folding is the primary
pathology in Marinesco-Sjogren syndrome.

Senderek et al. (2005) identified the gene encoding the ER resident
protein SIL1 in the 2.8-Mb critical region for the MSS phenotype. They
noted that SIL1 is ubiquitously expressed, and they confirmed its
expression in tissues targeted by MSS. They proceeded to identify
homozygous SIL1 coding sequence variants in 3 affected individuals. They
also discovered sequence variants on both alleles in 2 additional
consanguineous families, in 2 affected sib pairs from 2
nonconsanguineous families, and in an apparently isolated case. Senderek
et al. (2005) suggested that there are several reasons why loss of
functional SIL1 could lead to a multisystem disorder like MSS. In
mammalian cells, most secretory pathway proteins enter the ER
cotranslationally through multiprotein complexes called 'translocons.'
Chaperone GRP78, also called HSPA5 and BIP, regulates translocon gating
at the ER membrane in an ATP-dependent manner. As SIL1 promotes BiP
ATP-ADP exchange, reduction of SIL1 levels could affect translocon
gating, resulting in decreased ER protein synthesis. Thus, MSS may be a
disorder of protein biosynthesis or processing in the ER.

In affected members of 5 families with Marinesco-Sjogren syndrome.
Anttonen et al. (2008) identified 4 novel homozygous mutations in the
SIL1 gene (see, e.g., 608005.0007 and 608005.0008). All had the classic
features of cerebellar atrophy and ataxia, cataracts, mental
retardation, and some form of myopathy though severity varied somewhat.

In 3 Japanese sibs with Marinesco-Sjogren syndrome, Takahata et al.
(2010) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 deletions in the SIL1
gene: a 5-bp deletion (598delGAAGA; 608005.0009) and a 58-kb deletion
(608005.0010) both in exon 6. Each unaffected parent was heterozygous
for 1 of the deletions. The 58-kb deletion was not detected by the
standard PCR sequencing protocol, and was only found after array
comparative genomic hybridization and quantitative PCR analysis.
Takahata et al. (2010) suggested that some MSS patients in whom
mutations are not found should be screened for larger deletions in the
SIL1 gene. All 3 patients had cataracts, ataxia, hypotonia, myopathy,
spasticity, mental retardation, and skeletal deformities.

ANIMAL MODEL

Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperones and ER stress have been implicated
in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer
(104300) and Parkinson (168600) diseases. Zhao et al. (2005) established
a direct in vivo link between ER dysfunction and neurodegeneration. They
showed that mice homozygous with respect to the 'woozy' (wz) mutation
develop adult-onset ataxia with cerebellar Purkinje cell loss. Affected
cells have intracellular protein accumulations reminiscent of protein
inclusions in both the ER and the nucleus. In addition, upregulation of
the unfolded protein response, suggestive of ER stress, occurs in mutant
Purkinje cells. Zhao et al. (2005) reported that the wz mutation
disrupts the gene Sil1, which encodes an adenine nucleotide exchange
factor of BiP (HSPA5; 138120), a crucial ER chaperone. The finding
provided evidence that perturbation of ER chaperone function in
terminally differentiated neurons leads to protein accumulation, ER
stress, and subsequent neurodegeneration.

Zhao et al. (2010) reported that overexpression of Hyou1 (601746), an
exchange factor that works in parallel to Sil1, prevented ER stress and
rescued neurodegeneration in Sil1 -/- mice, whereas decreasing
expression of Hyou1 exacerbated these phenotypes. In addition, loss of
Dnajc3 (601184), a cochaperone that promotes ATP hydrolysis by BiP,
ameliorated ER stress and neurodegeneration in Sil1 -/- mice. Zhao et
al. (2010) suggested that alterations in the nucleotide exchange cycle
of BiP may cause ER stress and neurodegeneration in Sil1 -/- mice.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MARINESCO-SJOGREN SYNDROME
SIL1, 4-BP DUP, 506AAGA

In all Finnish individuals with Marinesco-Sjogren syndrome (MSS;
248800), Anttonen et al. (2005) found a 4-nucleotide duplication,
506_509dupAAGA, in exon 6 of the SIL1 gene.

.0002
MARINESCO-SJOGREN SYNDROME
SIL1, IVS6, G-A, +1

In a 5-year-old Turkish male with MSS (248800), the offspring of
consanguineous parents, Senderek et al. (2005) found homozygosity for a
splice site mutation in intron 6, 645+1G-A, which resulted in skipping
of exon 6. Cataracts had been diagnosed at the age of 4.5 years. Ataxia,
hypotonia, short stature, cerebellar atrophy, myopathic EMG, and
myopathic biopsy showing membranous structure associated with myonuclei
were features. Senderek et al. (2005) generated a putative model of the
SIL1-BIP (138120) interaction, which suggested that SIL1 exons 6 and 9
have a key role in associating with BIP. Thus the mutants that lack
exons 6 or 9, or both, would be expected to be defective in binding to
BIP.

.0003
MARINESCO-SJOGREN SYNDROME
SIL1, IVS6, T-C, +2

In 2 Swedish individuals with a Finnish paternal ancestor and MSS
(248800), Anttonen et al. (2005) found compound heterozygosity for the
universal Finnish mutation (608005.0001) and a donor splice site
mutation in intron 6, 645+2T-C. RT-PCR analysis of SIL1 from lymphocyte
RNA showed that the duplication mutant transcript was of the expected
length, whereas 2 shorter variants were expressed from the splice site
mutated allele. In the shorter of these, which was expressed at higher
levels, exon 6 was skipped, predicting an in-frame deletion of 64 amino
acids. In the longer variant, a cryptic splice site in exon 6 was used,
predicting an in-frame deletion of 30 amino acids.

.0004
MARINESCO-SJOGREN SYNDROME
SIL1, ARG111TER

In a 14-year-old Iranian female with MSS (248800), offspring of
consanguineous parents, Senderek et al. (2005) found a homozygous
nonsense mutation, arg111 to stop (R111X), due to a change of nucleotide
331 in exon 4 from C to T. The girl had congenital cataracts, ataxia,
hypotonia, psychomotor delay, short stature, skeletal deformities,
hypogonadism, elevated serum creatine kinase, cerebellar atrophy,
myopathic biopsy and EMG, and membranous structure associated with
myonuclei. The R111X mutation was also found in homozygous form in
Turkish sisters, aged 38 and 16 years. Cataracts had been diagnosed at
the age of 4 years in each of them.

The R111X mutation was also described in a Turkish family by Anttonen et
al. (2005).

Aguglia et al. (2000) reported 2 Italian brothers who had MSS and
chylomicron retention disease (CMRD; 246700). In these patients, Jones
et al. (2003) identified a mutation in the SAR1B gene (607690.0006),
responsible for CMRD, and Annesi et al. (2007) identified an R111X
mutation in the SIL1 gene, responsible for MSS. The findings indicated
that the patients had 2 distinct diseases due to mutations in 2
different genes, rather than defects in a single gene leading to both
disorders.

.0005
MARINESCO-SJOGREN SYNDROME
SIL1, IVS9, G-A, +1

In an 11-year-old Bosnian male with MSS (248800), born of consanguineous
parents, Senderek et al. (2005) found homozygosity for a donor splice
site mutation of intron 9, 1029+1G-A, that resulted in skipping of exon
9. Congenital cataracts, ataxia, hypotonia, psychomotor delay, short
stature, cerebellar atrophy, and myopathic EMG and biopsy were
described.

.0006
MARINESCO-SJOGREN SYNDROME
SIL1, GLN438TER

In 4 affected members of 2 separate sibships in a consanguineous
Egyptian family with Marinesco-Sjogren syndrome (248800), Karim et al.
(2006) found a homozygous C-to-T transition at nucleotide 1312 in exon
10 of the SIL1 gene, resulting in a glutamine to stop codon change at
position 438 (Q438X). A curious feature in this family was the lack of
cerebellar ataxia in a 25-year-old male and 19-year-old female who were
sibs of the mother of 7- and 9-year-old females with full expression of
Marinesco-Sjogren syndrome. The older patients had delayed physical and
mental development, mental retardation, progressive muscle weakness,
hypotonia of legs, and cataract. The male showed hypogonadism.

.0007
MARINESCO-SJOGREN SYNDROME
SIL1, LEU457PRO

In 2 Japanese sibs with Marinesco-Sjogren syndrome (248800), born of
consanguineous parents, Anttonen et al. (2008) identified a homozygous
1370T-C transition in exon 10 of the SIL1 gene, resulting in a
leu457-to-pro (L457P) substitution. One of the affected sibs had a twin
brother who died soon after birth. Both brothers showed psychomotor
delay and distinct cerebellar symptoms, including limb and truncal
ataxia, hypotonia, and dysarthria. They also had congenital cataracts.
In transfected COS-1 cells, the L457P mutant protein showed altered
subcellular localization compared to the wildtype protein. The mutant
protein was observed to form aggregates within the endoplasmic
reticulum.

.0008
MARINESCO-SJOGREN SYNDROME
SIL1, 1-BP DUP, 936G

In 2 Japanese sisters with Marinesco-Sjogren syndrome (248800), Anttonen
et al. (2008) identified a homozygous 1-bp duplication (936dupG) in exon
9 of the SIL1 gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature termination.
The parents were second cousins once removed. Both sisters had bilateral
cataracts, learned to walk but with unstable gait, and lost ambulation
around 20 years of age. Other features included short stature,
psychomotor delay, hypotonia, and cerebellar atrophy.

.0009
MARINESCO-SJOGREN SYNDROME
SIL1, 5-BP DEL, 598GAAGA

In 3 Japanese sibs with Marinesco-Sjogren syndrome (248800), Takahata et
al. (2010) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 deletions in the
SIL1 gene: a 5-bp deletion (598delGAAGA) in exon 6, and a 58-kb deletion
in exon 6 (608005.0010). Each unaffected parent was heterozygous for 1
of the deletions. The 5-bp deletion was not detected in 80 healthy
Japanese individuals. The 58-kb deletion was not detected by the PCR
sequencing protocol, and was only found after array comparative genomic
hybridization and quantitative PCR analysis. The breakpoints of the
58-kb deletion were in a LINE/L1 repetitive sequence in intron 5 and in
a unique sequence in intron 7. Takahata et al. (2010) suggested that
some MSS patients in whom mutations are not found should be screened for
larger deletions in the SIL1 gene. All 3 patients had cataracts, ataxia,
hypotonia, myopathy, spasticity, mental retardation, and skeletal
deformities.

;;FBL16;;
CHROMOSOME 16 OPEN READING FRAME 22; C16ORF22
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the F-box protein family, such as FBXL16, are characterized
by an approximately 40-amino acid F-box motif. SCF complexes, formed by
SKP1 (601434), cullin (see CUL1; 603134), and F-box proteins, act as
protein-ubiquitin ligases. F-box proteins interact with SKP1 through the
F box, and they interact with ubiquitination targets through other
protein interaction domains (Jin et al., 2004).

CLONING

Jin et al. (2004) reported that the human FBXL16 protein contains an F
box in its N-terminal half, followed by a spacer, 8 tandemly arrayed
leucine-rich repeats, another spacer, and a C-terminal leucine-rich
repeat.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Daniels et al. (2001) mapped the FBXL16 gene,
which they called C16ORF22, to a gene-rich region of chromosome 16p13.3.

Jin et al. (2004) stated that the mouse Fbxl16 gene maps to chromosome
17A3.3.

189908	TITLE *189908 TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR 7; TCF7
;;TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR, T CELL-SPECIFIC, 1;;
T CELL FACTOR 1; TCF1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Three of the genes determining subunits of the CD3 complex, CD3-gamma
(CD3G; 186740), CD3-delta (CD3D; 186790), and CD3-epsilon (CD3E;
186830), are tightly clustered in a stretch of 60 kb of DNA on human
chromosome 11q23. This tight clustering might suggest that the CD3 genes
are controlled by a single cis-acting element. Experiments with
transgenic mice, however, have shown that at least the CD3D and CD3E
genes carry a complete and independent set of regulatory elements. CD3E
gene expression appears to be controlled by a downstream T
lymphocyte-specific enhancer element. By screening for proteins in human
T cells that bound the T lymphocyte-specific enhancer element downstream
of CD3E, followed by screening human T-cell line cDNA libraries, van de
Wetering et al. (1991) cloned 3 splice variants of TCF7, which they
called TCF1A, TCF1B, and TCF1C. The deduced proteins contain 269, 269,
and 268 amino acids, respectively. Each has an N-terminal proline-rich
domain, followed by an HMG1 (HMGB1; 163905)-like DNA-binding domain and
a unique C-terminal end. Northern blot analysis detected a 3-kb
transcript in all human T-cell lines examined, but not in non-T cell
lines.

Van de Wetering et al. (1992) stated that the HMG box domain of TCF7 is
almost identical to the HMG box domain of TCF1-alpha (LEF1; 153245).

Van de Wetering et al. (1996) cloned several additional TCF7 splice
variants encoding at least 8 TCF7 isoforms. The isoforms differ
predominantly in the presence or absence of a long N-terminal domain,
the presence or absence of an insertion near the center of the molecule,
and the presence or absence of a long C-terminal domain. The 116-amino
acid long N-terminal domain shares significant similarity with LEF1.
Western blot analysis of human thymocytes and Jurkat T cells showed
proteins with apparent molecular masses of 25 to 55 kD.
Dephosphorylation did not alter the mobility of the proteins.

GENE STRUCTURE

Van de Wetering et al. (1992) found that the TCF7 gene contains at least
10 exons, the first of which is noncoding. The region immediately
upstream of exon 1 is CG rich (75%) and includes a CpG island. The CpG
island coincided with a functional promoter that was preferentially
active in T-cell lines.

Van de Wetering et al. (1996) determined that the TCF7 gene spans about
12 kb and contains 14 exons, 4 of which are alternatively spliced. It
has 2 promoter regions and 2 transcriptional start sites.

MAPPING

Van de Wetering et al. (1991) mapped the TCF7 gene to chromosome 5q31.1
by somatic cell hybrid analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization.

Kingsmore et al. (1995) mapped the homologous gene to mouse chromosome
11.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a gel retardation assay, van de Wetering et al. (1991) showed that
all 3 recombinant isoforms of TCF7, which they called TCF1A, TCF1B, and
TCF1C, bound the same motif in the T lymphocyte-specific enhancer
element downstream of CD3E. Following expression in COS cells,
full-length TCF1A, but not TCF1A lacking part of its DNA-binding domain,
activated transcription of a reporter gene.

Van de Wetering et al. (1996) showed that all TCF7 isoforms with the
short N-terminal end moderately transactivated transcription through the
TCR-alpha (TCRA; see 186880) enhancer, a LEF1 target. In contrast, TCF7
isoforms with the long N-terminal end showed no transactivation
activity.

Roose et al. (1999) identified TCF7 mRNA by Northern blot analysis in 5
of 6 colorectal cell lines. Three of these were APC (611731) mutants,
and 2 others carried oncogenic mutations in beta-catenin (CTNNB1;
116806). The cell line that lacked TCF7 expression was wildtype for APC
and beta-catenin, suggesting that APC and beta-catenin may regulate TCF7
expression. Roose et al. (1999) also detected nuclear TCF7 protein in
normal human tissues: in proliferating intestinal epithelial cells and
in the basal epithelial cells of mammary gland epithelium. Roose et al.
(1999) noted that the most abundant TCF7 isoforms lack a beta-catenin
interaction domain and are likely to function as negative regulators of
Wnt signaling (see 164820). Roose et al. (1999) identified TCF7 as one
of the target genes of TCF4 (TCF7L2; 602228) in epithelial cells. They
found a putative enhancer upstream of promoter 1 of TCF7. Reporter
assays showed that a combination of TCF4 and beta-catenin transactivated
the enhancer, whereas a dominant-negative TCF4 inhibited enhancer
activity.

Gattinoni et al. (2009) reported that induction of Wnt/beta-catenin
signaling by inhibitors of Gsk3b (605004) or by Wnt3a (606359) arrested
mouse Cd8 (see 186910)-positive T-cell development into effector T cells
capable of cytotoxicity or Ifng (147570) production. Instead, Wnt
signaling promoted expression of Tcf7 and Lef1 (153245) and generation
of self-renewing multipotent Cd8-positive memory stem cells capable of
proliferation and antitumor activity. Gattinoni et al. (2009) concluded
that Wnt signaling has a key role in maintaining the self-renewing stem
cell-like properties of mature memory CD8-positive T cells.

Using RT-PCR and flow cytometric analysis, Zhao et al. (2010)
demonstrated that mouse Tcf7 and Lef1 were highly expressed in naive T
cells, downregulated in effector T cells, and upregulated in memory T
cells. Memory Cd8-positive T cells expressing the p45 Tcf7 isoform and
beta-catenin had enhanced Il2 (147680) production capacity and enhanced
effector capacity to clear Listeria monocytogenes. Zhao et al. (2010)
concluded that constitutive activation of the Wnt pathway favors memory
CD8 T-cell formation during immunization, resulting in enhanced immunity
upon a second encounter with the same pathogen.

Using a genetic approach, Driessens et al. (2010) found no evidence that
the beta-catenin pathway regulates T-cell memory phenotype, in contrast
with the findings of Gattinoni et al. (2009). The findings of Driessens
et al. (2010) suggested that the generation of Cd8-positive memory stem
cells observed by Gattinoni et al. (2009) with the use of Gsk3b
inhibitors was not a consequence of activation of the beta-catenin
pathway, but was rather due activation of another Gsk3b-dependent
pathway. In a reply, Gattinoni et al. (2010) noted that others,
including Zhao et al. (2010) and Jeannet et al. (2010), had also
identified Wnt and beta-catenin as crucial factors in postthymic
Cd8-positive T-cell differentiation and memory development. Using
Western blot analysis, Gattinoni et al. (2010) showed that addition of
Wnt3a or Gsk3b inhibitor stabilized beta-catenin in primed Cd8-positive
mouse T cells.

Weber et al. (2011) found that Tcf7 was highly expressed in mouse early
tymic progenitor cells and that its expression was upregulated in
response to Notch1 (190198) signals. Forcible expression of human TCF7
in mouse bone marrow progenitors drove development of T-lineage cells in
the absence of Notch1 signals. These Tcf7-induced cells expressed
T-cell-specific transcription factors, such as Gata3 (131320) and Bcl11b
(606558), as well as T-cell receptor components, such as Cd3e. Weber et
al. (2011) concluded that TCF7 is essential for normal T-cell
development and sufficient to establish many components of T-cell
identity.

ANIMAL MODEL

Verbeek et al. (1995) generated 2 independent germline mutations in Tcf7
by targeted disruption and found that thymocyte development in the
otherwise normal mutant mice was blocked at the transition from the
Cd8-positive immature single-positive to the Cd4
(186940)-positive/Cd8-positive double-positive stage. In contrast with
wildtype mice, most of the immature single-positive cells in the mutant
mice were not in the cell cycle, and the number of immunocompetent T
cells in the peripheral lymphoid organs was reduced. Verbeek et al.
(1995) concluded that TCF7 controls an essential step in thymocyte
differentiation.

Roose et al. (1999) found that Tcf7 -/- mice developed adenomas in the
gut and mammary glands. They hypothesized that one possible explanation
for the tumor phenotype in Tcf7 -/- mice is that Tcf7 acts as a feedback
transcriptional repressor of beta-catenin/Tcf4 target genes, and that
disruption of this negative-feedback loop allows the formation of
epithelial tumors, much like the loss of Apc. This notion predicts
synergy between the loss of Tcf7 and of Apc. To test this, Roose et al.
(1999) crossed the Apc allele Min into a Tcf7 -/- strain. Min/+ mice
developed multiple polyps, mostly in the small intestine. They
infrequently developed extraintestinal neoplasia, notably
adenoacanthomas in the mammary gland. Min/+ Tcf7 -/- mice displayed a
marked enhancement of the intestinal Min/+ phenotype. All intestinal
neoplasms expressed high levels of beta-catenin. In addition, all
females carried adenoacanthomas of the mammary gland by 8 weeks of age,
while substantial numbers of older male mice developed similar lesions.
Roose et al. (1999) concluded that TCF7 may act as a feedback repressor
of beta-catenin/TCF4 target genes and thus may cooperate with APC to
suppress malignant transformation of epithelial cells.

Jeannet et al. (2010) found that mice lacking Tcf7, a nuclear effector
of Wnt signaling, mounted normal effector and memory Cd8-positive T-cell
responses to viral infection. However, Tcf7-deficient mice were impaired
in their ability to expand upon secondary challenge and to protect from
recurrent virus infection due to a lack of Cd8 memory precursor T cells.
Establishment of memory cells was dependent on the Tcf7
beta-catenin-binding domain and required the Tcf7 coactivators and Wnt
signaling intermediates beta-catenin and gamma-catenin (JUP; 173325).
Jeannet et al. (2010) concluded that the Wnt signaling pathway plays an
essential role for CD8 central memory T-cell differentiation and
proposed that modulation of Wnt signaling may be exploited to improve
the generation of CD8 memory T cells during vaccination or
immunotherapy.

Zhou et al. (2010) showed that loss of Tcf7 in mice limited
proliferation of Cd8-positive effector T cells and impaired their
differentiation into memory cells. Tcf7 -/- memory Cd8-positive T cells
were progressively lost and exhibited reduced expression of Bcl2
(151430) and Il2rb (146710) and diminished Il15 (600554)-driven
proliferation. Transcriptome analysis of Tcf7 -/- memory Cd8-positive
cells showed strong downregulation of Eomes (604615). The Wnt-Tcf7
pathway was necessary and sufficient for inducing optimal expression of
Eomes, which positively regulated Il2rb expression and Il15
responsiveness. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed direct
and specific binding of Tcf7 and multiple conserved cis-regulatory
sequences of the Eomes gene. Zhou et al. (2010) concluded that TCF7 is a
critical player in a transcriptional program that regulates memory CD8
differentiation and longevity.

NOMENCLATURE

Although the symbol TCF1 (T cell-specific transcription factor-1) is
used in the literature for this gene, its official designation is TCF7.
It should not be confused with the HNF1A gene (142410), which has also
been referred to as TCF1 (transcription factor-1) in the literature.

137026	TITLE *137026 G PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTOR KINASE 4; GRK4
;;GPRK4;;
G PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTOR KINASE 2 (DROSOPHILA)-LIKE; GPRK2L
DESCRIPTION G protein-coupled receptor kinases are a family of serine/threonine
kinases that appear to play a role in receptor desensitization.
Beta-adrenergic receptor kinase-1 (109635) and rhodopsin kinase (180381)
are examples. They phosphorylate the activated form of the corresponding
receptor, increasing its ability to interact with beta-arrestin or
retinal arrestin, respectively. Binding of the arrestins to the
receptors then blocks further activation of the respective signal
transduction pathways.

CLONING

Ambrose et al. (1992) applied the exon amplification technique to
overlapping cosmids spanning the D4S127 locus, which displays strong
linkage disequilibrium with the Huntington disease (HD; 143100)
phenotype on 4p16.3. They identified a gene encoding a novel member of a
family of protein kinases that specifically phosphorylate the activated
forms of G protein-coupled receptors. Because of its location and
function, the gene was for a time considered a candidate for the site of
a mutation in HD.

Premont et al. (1996) determined that there are 4 isoforms of GPRK2L, or
GRK4. The full-length protein contains 578 amino acids, while the splice
variants enode proteins that contain 546, 532, and 500 amino acids due
to the absence of exon 2, exon 15, and both exons 2 and 15,
respectively. Northern blot analysis of 16 human tissues detected high
expression of a 2.5-kb GPRK2L transcript only in testis.

GENE FUNCTION

Sallese et al. (1997) showed that only the full-length GRK4 protein has
kinase activity and that it interacts with and is inhibitable by
calmodulin (CALM1; 114180).

GENE STRUCTURE

Premont et al. (1996) determined that the GPRK2L gene contains 16 exons
and spans more than 75 kb.

MAPPING

By cosmid analysis, Ambrose et al. (1992) mapped the GPRK2L gene to
chromosome 4p16.3. Grosson et al. (1994) mapped the murine homolog for
an anonymous G protein-coupled receptor kinase, symbolized Gprkl, to
chromosome 5 in a continuous linkage group that included the Huntington
disease homolog.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

GRKs are implicated in genetic and acquired hypertension (145500)
because they participate in the desensitization of G protein-coupled
receptors, including D1 receptors (126449). The GRK-mediated
desensitization is caused, in part, by serine phosphorylation of the
receptor. Basal serine-phosphorylated D1 receptor is increased in renal
proximal tubules from genetically hypertensive rodents, as well as from
humans with essential hypertension. Because GRK4 shows limited
expression, and because its gene locus has been linked to hypertension
(Casari et al., 1995), Felder et al. (2002) sought to determine whether
GRK4 is expressed in renal proximal tubules and whether genetic variants
of GRK4 affect renal function and blood pressure. They found that in
human essential hypertension, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of
the GRK4-gamma isoform increased GRK activity and caused the serine
phosphorylation and uncoupling of the D1 receptor from its G
protein/effector enzyme complex in the renal proximal tubule and in
transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells. Moreover, expressing the
ala142-to-val (A142V) SNP of GRK4-gamma, but not the wildtype gene, in
transgenic mice produced hypertension and impaired the diuretic and
natriuretic but not the hypotensive effects of D1-like agonist
stimulation. The authors concluded that these findings provide a
mechanism for the D1 receptor coupling defect in the kidney and may
explain the inability of the kidney to properly excrete sodium in
genetic hypertension.

;;INTERLEUKIN 27 RECEPTOR; IL27R;;
T-CELL CYTOKINE RECEPTOR; TCCR;;
WSX1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Interleukin-27 (IL27) is a heterodimeric cytokine composed of p28 (IL27;
608273) and EBI3 (605816) subunits. The IL27 receptor consists of the
unique IL27RA chain and the common gp130 (IL6ST; 600694) chain, which is
used by several other cytokines. IL27RA is widely expressed in the
immune system, and IL27 can trigger signaling in T cells, B cells, and
myeloid cells (Batten et al., 2006)

CLONING

Sprecher et al. (1998) searched an EST database for sequences similar to
the class I cytokine receptor gp130. They identified a cDNA encoding a
class I cytokine receptor, which they designated WSX1, from an infant
brain cDNA library. Using a homology screen, Chen et al. (2000)
identified TCCR (T-cell cytokine receptor), a type I cytokine receptor
family member identical to WSX1 and most homologous (26% identity; 37%
similarity) to IL12RB2 (601642).

By screening a peripheral blood leukocyte (PBL) library, Chen et al.
(2000) isolated a full-length cDNA encoding a deduced 636-amino acid
TCCR protein. Sequence analysis predicted a single transmembrane domain,
a WSX signature motif, and 7 potential N-glycosylation sites in its
extracellular domain, and a box1 motif in its intracellular region.
Mouse Tccr, isolated from a spleen library, is 62% identical to the
human sequence. Northern blot analysis revealed expression of a 3.5-kb
transcript in human PBL, thymus, and spleen as well as in adult and
fetal lung. Real-time PCR analysis of mouse splenocytes revealed highest
expression in CD4 (186940)-positive T cells and in natural killer cells.
Among CD4-positive T cells, expression was highest in undifferentiated
(Th0) cells, with reduced expression in Th1 and Th2 cells.

GENE FUNCTION

By screening cells expressing members of the IL6 (147620)/IL12 (see
IL12B; 161561) family of signaling receptors and coimmunoprecipitation
experiments, Pflanz et al. (2002) demonstrated that only WSX1 binds to
IL27, a heterodimer consisting of IL30 (IL27) and EBI3.

Takeda et al. (2003) showed that STAT1 (600555) interacted with a
conserved cytoplasmic domain tyrosine residue of WSX1 after the residue
was phosphorylated. IL27 stimulation induced phosphorylation of STAT1
and expression of TBET (TBX21; 604895) and IL12RB2 in wildtype, but not
WSX1-deficient, naive CD4-positive T cells. Together with IL12, IL27
augmented IFNG secretion in wildtype, but not WSX1-deficient, naive
CD4-positive T cells. Takeda et al. (2003) concluded that the IL27-WSX1
signaling system acts before the IL12R system in STAT1-mediated TBET
induction during the initiation of Th1 differentiation.

Pflanz et al. (2004) found that transfection of WSX1 into a cell line
expressing gp130 but only low levels of WSX1 resulted in IL27-dependent
phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 (102582). In addition, they showed
that anti-gp130 blocked IL27-mediated cellular effects. Quantitative PCR
analysis indicated that, in addition to naive CD4-positive T cells,
numerous cell types expressed both gp130 and WSX1, including mast cells.
IL27 stimulation of mast cells resulted in upregulation of
proinflammatory cytokine expression. Pflanz et al. (2004) concluded that
IL27 not only contributes to the development of an adaptive immune
response through its action on CD4-positive T cells, but also directly
acts on cells of the innate immune system.

Pradhan et al. (2007) isolated a cDNA encoding IL27R from an AML
(601626) patient cDNA library that transformed an IL3 (147740)-dependent
myeloid progenitor cell line to IL3 independence. IL27R-transformed
myeloid cells had elevated levels of activated STAT1, STAT3, STAT5
(601511), JAK1 (147795), JAK2 (147796), ERK1 (MAPK3; 601795), and ERK2
(MAPK1; 176948). Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated increased IL27R
expression on bone marrow cells from most AML patients examined.
Inhibition of JAK family kinases prevented IL27R-mediated transformation
of myeloid cells. Mutation analysis showed that IL27R required its box-1
motif, which is necessary for interaction with JAK proteins, for
transforming activity. IL27R could also transform IL3-dependent pro-B
lymphocytes lacking gp130 to IL3 independence, indicating that IL27R
does not need gp130 for its transforming activity. IL27R activated JAK2
with the val617-to-phe mutation (V617F; 147796.0001), which is found in
myeloproliferative disorders and AML, in transfected human embryonic
kidney cells. Pradhan et al. (2007) concluded that IL27R possesses
hematopoietic cell-transforming properties and suggested that, like
homodimeric type I cytokine receptors, single-chain components of
heterodimeric cytokine receptors can enhance activation of JAK2 V617F
and may be involved in myeloproliferative disorders.

MAPPING

Sprecher et al. (1998) mapped the WSX1 gene to chromosome 19 by PCR
analysis of a somatic cell hybrid panel. They refined the localization
to 19p13.11 by linkage analysis using a radiation hybrid panel.

ANIMAL MODEL

CD4-positive helper T cells differentiate into Th1 cells, which are
critical for cell-mediated immunity, predominantly under the influence
of IL12. IL4 (147780) influences their differentiation into Th2 cells,
which are critical for most antibody responses. Mice deficient in these
cytokines, their receptors, or associated transcription factors have
impaired, but not absent, Th1 or Th2 immune responses. Chen et al.
(2000) generated Tccr-deficient mice by gene targeting and showed that
these mice have intact or enhanced Th2 phenotypes, as assessed by IL4
production. Tccr-deficient mice are viable, fertile, and display no
overt abnormalities. Although intrinsic IFNG (147570) production is
normal in response to nonspecific stimulation with lipopolysaccharide,
Th1 responses, as measured by IFNG production in response to
immunization with keyhole limpet hemocyanin or IFNG-dependent production
of IgG2a antibodies in response to ovalbumin, are severely impaired. In
addition, infection of control and Tccr-deficient mice with the
intracellular pathogen Listeria monocytogenes resulted in bacterial
titers that were a million-fold higher in livers of Tccr-deficient mice.
The observed Th1 deficiency did not appear to be a result of a defect in
the IL12 receptor, as both subunits of the receptor were expressed
normally in activated T cells, and the cells proliferated in response to
IL12 stimulation. Chen et al. (2000) proposed that TCCR and its
potential ligand are candidate targets for intervention in Th1-mediated
autoimmune disease and allograft rejection.

Yoshida et al. (2001) generated mice deficient in Wsx1 by homologous
recombination. Wsx1-deficient mice were apparently normal and healthy.
In vitro immunologic analysis showed that the Wsx1 -/- mice had weak
IFNG primary responses but normal secondary responses to mitogen
compared with wildtype mice. In response to Leishmania infection, mice
lacking Wsx1 were more susceptible than wildtype mice and had weak early
IFNG responses. The footpads were enlarged with severe ulceration. The
phenotype was not as severe as that of Balb-c mice. RT-PCR analysis
indicated that high early IL4 levels were maintained in the knockout
mice. Infection with the avirulent Mycobacterium bovis BCG resulted in
numerous enlarged and poorly differentiated liver granulomas in Wsx1 -/-
mice compared with wildtype. However, there was no significant
difference in bacterial numbers or in liver damage as assessed by
transaminase levels. Yoshida et al. (2001) concluded that the impact of
lack of Wsx1 early in response to infectious agents is significant, but
the impact is mitigated by the presence of other cytokines, such as IFNG
and IL12, and their receptors in later phases of the infection.

Villarino et al. (2003) found that Wsx1-deficient mice that were
infected with the intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii established
protective T-cell responses, as measured by inflammatory cytokine
production. However, the infected Wsx1-deficient mice were unable to
downregulate these responses, which led to a lethal T cell-mediated
inflammatory disease. The pathology was characterized by excessive Ifng
production, persistence of highly activated T cells, and enhanced in
vivo T-cell proliferation. Villarino et al. (2003) concluded that WSX1
is not required for generation of IFNG-mediated immunity to T. gondii,
but it antagonizes T cell-mediated immune hyperactivity.

Hamano et al. (2003) reported that Wsx1 -/- mice were unable to control
the parasitemia after infection with the intracellular pathogen
Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, or American
trypanosomiasis. Wsx1-deficient mice also sustained severe liver injury
and increased mortality compared with wildtype mice. The pathology was
associated with enhanced levels of Th2 cytokines and the inflammatory
cytokines Il6 and Tnfa (191160), as well as overproduction of Ifng,
which was responsible for the liver lesions. Hamano et al. (2003)
concluded that WSX1 suppresses liver injury by regulating production of
proinflammatory cytokines and controls parasitemia by suppressing Th2
responses.

Batten et al. (2006) found that Il27ra -/- mice were hypersusceptible to
experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), with significantly
increased demyelination and inflammation, and had more inflammatory Il17
(IL17A; 603149)-producing T (Th17) cells in draining lymph nodes
compared with wildtype mice. Flow cytometric analysis showed that
increased Il17 production also occurred in the central nervous system of
mutant mice. In vitro, Il27 was more efficient than Ifng in suppressing
Th17 cell differentiation, and it could overcome the Th17-promoting
effects of Il6. The suppressive activity of Il27 was dependent on Stat1
activation. EAE was ameliorated in Il27ra -/- mice treated with
anti-Il17, but it was more severe in mice lacking both Il27ra and Ifngr
(107470). Batten et al. (2006) concluded that IL27 inhibits Th17
differentiation in a STAT1-dependent, IFNG-independent manner, and that
IL27 functions by antagonizing IL6, which is required for Th17 cell
differentiation and EAE pathogenesis.

Using RT-PCR, Stumhofer et al. (2006) found that mice with toxoplasmic
encephalitis showed a dramatic increase in expression of Il27 and a much
smaller increase in expression of Ebi3. T. gondii-infected mice lacking
Il27ra were protected from acute lethality by Ctla4 (123890)-Ig
treatment, but they succumbed during the chronic phase of infection due
to inflammation and necrosis associated with pathogenic Cd4-positive,
Il17-expressing T cells infiltrating the brain. Treatment of T cells
with anti-Il6 or Il27 inhibited Il17 production. Il27-mediated
inhibition of Il17 production was dependent on Stat1 and independent of
inhibition of Il6 signaling mediated by Socs3 (604176). Stumhofer et al.
(2006) proposed that IL27 may be a useful target in treating
inflammatory diseases mediated by Th17 cells.

176610	TITLE *176610 PROFILIN 1; PFN1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Profilin-1 is a 140-amino acid protein and major growth regulator of
filamentous (F)-actin through its binding of monomeric (G)-actin
(Mockrin and Korn, 1980).

CLONING

Profilin is a ubiquitous 12- to 15-kD protein which inhibits the
polymerization of actin. It is thought to function by complexing with
unpolymerized actin in vivo. Dissociation of the profilin-actin complex
is caused by binding of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to
profilin. Ampe et al. (1988) described the amino acid sequence of human
platelet profilin and found it to have 95% homology to the sequence of
calf spleen profilin.

GENE FUNCTION

Goldschmidt-Clermont and Janmey (1991) reviewed the function of
profilin, partly on the basis of work in the S. cerevisiae, homolog, PFY
(Vojtek et al., 1991). Theriot and Mitchison (1993) reviewed the
multiple functions of profilin.

MAPPING

By Southern blot analysis of somatic cell hybrid DNA, Kwiatkowski and
Bruns (1988) found that at least 4 dispersed genetic loci in the human
genome hybridize with the profilin cDNA as well as the untranslated
region fragments, suggesting that several of these loci represent
pseudogenes of recent evolutionary origin. Chromosomes 1, 6, 13, and 17
were implicated. In addition, 5-prime and 3-prime untranslated regions
were found to be conserved between humans and rodents, implying a
functional role for these regions of the profilin gene. Kwiatkowski et
al. (1990) localized the functional profilin gene to 17p13 by analysis
of somatic cell hybrids and by in situ hybridization. By study of
patients with deletions and by use of somatic cell hybrids containing a
deleted chromosome 17, Kwiatkowski et al. (1990) sublocalized the PFN1
gene to 17p13.3. This is the same region as that deleted in the
Miller-Dieker syndrome (MDLS; 247200). They found that the gene indeed
was deleted in some patients with MDLS but that other patients had
smaller deletions not affecting the profilin locus. Thus, a single
allelic deletion of the profilin locus may contribute to the clinical
phenotype of MDLS in some patients but does not play a major role in the
essential phenotype.

In the mouse, Klingenspor et al. (1997) mapped the Pfn1 gene to
chromosome 11 and a profilin-1 related sequence to chromosome 15.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Wu et al. (2012) identified 4 different mutations in the PFN1 gene in 7
of 274 familial ALS cases. One mutation (E117G; 176610.0004), was found
in 3 of 1,090 ALS cases and 3 of 7,560 controls. Wu et al. (2012)
performed in vitro assays and showed that mutant PFN1 produces
ubiquitinated, insoluble aggregates in transfected cells. In many cases
the aggregates contained the ALS-associated protein TDP43 (605078). The
E117G mutation (176610.0004) displayed a pattern more similar to
wildtype PFN1, with most of the expressed protein in the soluble
fraction. Wu et al. (2012) found that mutant PFN1 inhibited axon
outgrowth. Wu et al. (2012) concluded that mutations in the PFN1 gene
account for approximately 1 to 2% of familial ALS and suggested that
disruption of cytoskeletal pathways contribute importantly to ALS
pathogenicity.

ANIMAL MODEL

To examine the function of profilin-1 in vivo, Witke et al. (2001)
generated Pfn1 knockout mice. Homozygotes were not viable; they died as
early as the 2-cell stage, and no homozygous knockout blastocysts were
detectable. Adult heterozygotes showed a 50% reduction in profilin-1
expression with no apparent impairment of cell function. However,
heterozygous embryos had reduced survival during embryogenesis compared
with wildtype. Although weakly expressed in early embryos, profilin-2
(176590) could not compensate for lack of profilin-1. Their results
indicated that mouse profilin-1 is an essential protein that has
dosage-dependent effects on cell division and survival during
embryogenesis.

Yarovinsky et al. (2005) identified a profilin-like molecule from the
protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii that generates a potent IL12 (see
161560) response in murine dendritic cells that is dependent on MyD88
(602170). T. gondii profilin activates dendritic cells through TLR11
(606270) and is the first chemically defined ligand for this toll-like
receptor. Moreover, TLR11 is required in vivo for parasite-induced IL12
production and optimal resistance to infection, thereby establishing a
role for the receptor in host recognition of protozoan pathogens.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS 18
PFN1, CYS71GLY

In 3 families segregating autosomal dominant ALS18 (614808), Wu et al.
(2012) identified a T-to-G transversion at nucleotide 347 of the PFN1
gene, resulting in a cysteine-to-glycine substitution at codon 71
(C71G). In family 1, all 4 affected members for which DNA was available
possessed the C71G variant. A single obligate carrier of the C71G
variant did not develop disease, but she died before the average age of
onset of this family (50.0 +/- 6.6 years). All unaffected family members
displayed the wildtype genotype. This mutation was subsequently
identified in 2 other families. In family 3, the mutation was detected
in 3 other affected family members. A single unaffected member of the
family whose age was in the mid-forties was found to be a mutation
carrier. The average age of onset in this family was 41.1 +/- 4.3 years
for those definitively affected. Haplotype analysis suggested that the
C71G variant derives from a single ancestral mutation. This mutation was
not observed among 7,560 control samples (15,120 alleles).

.0002
AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS 18
PFN1, MET114THR

In 2 families (families 2 and 4) segregating autosomal dominant ALS18
(614808), Wu et al. (2012) identified a T-to-C transition at nucleotide
477 of the PFN1 gene, resulting in a methionine-to-threonine
substitution at codon 114 (M114T). In family 2, all 8 affected members
for whom DNA was available carried the mutation, and on the basis of
genotype in spouse and progeny, Wu et al. (2012) were able to confirm
that a ninth affected family member also carried the mutation. Of 7
unaffected members, 5 did not carry the M114T variant. One unaffected
mutation carrier was aged in the mid-forties and a second obligate
carrier was asymptomatic into the seventies, suggesting high but
incomplete penetrance of this mutation. The average age of onset for
family 2 was 41.9 +/- 5.3 years and for family 4 it was 52.0 +/- 13.1
years. This mutation was not observed among 7,560 control samples
(15,120 alleles).

.0003
AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS 18
PFN1, GLY118VAL

In an individual from a family with a parent-child segregating autosomal
dominant ALS18 (614808), Wu et al. (2012) identified a G-to-T
transversion at nucleotide 489 of the PFN1 gene, resulting in a
glycine-to-valine substitution at codon 118 (G118V). This mutation was
not observed among 7,560 control samples (15,120 alleles). The glycine
at this position is invariant down to zebrafish.

.0004
AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS 18
PFN1, GLU117GLY

In one family with autosomal dominant ALS (ALS18; 614808) with
incomplete penetrance, Wu et al. (2012) identified a 2-basepair
substitution, AA to GT, at nucleotides 46 and 47 of the PFN1 gene,
resulting in a glutamic acid-to-glycine substitution at codon 117
(E117G). This mutation was subsequently identified in 2 sporadic ALS
patients among 816 sequenced. Overall, this mutation was identified in 3
of 1,090 ALS cases and 3 of 7,560 control samples (2.75 x 10(-3) vs 3.97
x 10(-4); P = 0.030, two-tailed Fisher's exact test). Wu et al. (2012)
suggested that, while it could be argued that the E117G variant is
nonpathogenic, more likely it is less pathogenic than the other 3
mutations (C71G; 176610.0001, M114T; 176610.0002, and G118V;
176610.0003) identified in the PFN1 gene to that time. While Western
blot analysis of the soluble and insoluble fractions of cells
transfected with wildtype and mutant PFN1 proteins detected a
considerable portion of the C71G, M114T, and G118V mutant proteins in
the insoluble fraction, the E117G mutation displayed a pattern more
similar to wildtype PFN1, with most of the expressed protein in the
soluble fraction. The glu at position 117 is invariant down to
zebrafish.
