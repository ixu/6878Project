DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a candidate gene approach in the region of frequent allele loss on
chromosome 6q27 in sporadic ovarian cancer, Liu et al. (2002) identified
a human homolog of C. elegans unc93. The full-length UNC93A cDNA encodes
a deduced 457-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 50
kD. The protein contains a leader peptide followed by 7 transmembrane
domains. It shares 30% sequence identity with the C. elegans protein.
Northern blot analysis revealed a major transcript of approximately 2.1
kb in testis, small intestine, and colon; a smaller transcript of 1.1 kb
was also detected in spleen, prostate, ovary, small intestine, and
colon. No expression was detected in 8 ovarian cancer cell lines.
Transient expression of a GFP-UNC93A fusion protein in 293T cells showed
localization to the membrane.

GENE STRUCTURE

Liu et al. (2002) determined that the UNC93A gene contains 8 exons and
spans 24.5 kb. Alternative splicing results in 2 transcripts, one of
which lacks exon 4.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Liu et al. (2002) identified the UNC93A gene on
chromosome 6q27, centromeric to marker D6S149.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

By mutation analysis of the UNC93A gene in a panel of ovarian tumors and
ovarian cancer cell lines, Liu et al. (2002) found no evidence that
UNC93A is a tumor suppressor gene in sporadic ovarian cancer.

138250	TITLE *138250 ALDEHYDE DEHYDROGENASE 18 FAMILY, MEMBER A1; ALDH18A1
;;1-@PYRROLINE-5-CARBOXYLATE SYNTHETASE; PYCS;;
P5CS;;
GLUTAMATE GAMMA-SEMIALDEHYDE SYNTHETASE; GSAS
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Delta-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase (P5CS) catalyzes the ATP- and
NADPH-dependent conversion of L-glutamate to glutamic
gamma-semialdehyde, which is the metabolic precursor for proline
biosynthesis.

CLONING

By a method they referred to as 'database cloning,' Aral et al. (1996)
isolated and sequenced a cDNA encoding the human P5CS gene.

Hu et al. (1999) observed that mammalian P5CS undergoes alternative
splicing to generate 2 isoforms differing only by a 2-amino acid insert
at the N terminus of the gamma-glutamyl kinase active site. The short
isoform has high activity in the gut, where it participates in arginine
biosynthesis and is inhibited by ornithine. The long isoform, expressed
in multiple tissues, is necessary for the synthesis of proline from
glutamate and is insensitive to ornithine.

MAPPING

Jones (1975) presented evidence from cell hybrid studies that the
structural gene for the enzyme converting glutamate to its gamma
semialdehyde is located on chromosome 10. The fact that
glutamate-gamma-semialdehyde synthetase (GSAS) and glutamate
oxaloacetate transaminase (138180) are in the same biochemical pathway
and determined by genes on the same chromosome may have biologic
significance (Jones, 1975).

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Liu et al. (1996) mapped the PYCS
gene to 10q24.3.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Baumgartner et al. (2000) observed homozygosity for a missense mutation
in P5CS in the 2 sibs described by Rabier et al. (1992) with mental
retardation, joint hypermobility, skin hyperelasticity, cataract, and
metabolic abnormalities, including hyperammonemia, hypoprolinemia,
hypocitrullinemia, and hypoornithinemia (ARCL3A; 219150). The
arg84-to-gln mutation (R84Q; 138250.0001) alters a conserved residue in
the P5CS gamma-glutamyl kinase domain and dramatically reduces the
activity of both P5CS isoforms when expressed in mammalian cells.
Additionally, R84Q appears to destabilize the long isoform.

In affected individuals from a New Zealand family with mental
retardation, joint hypermobility, and skin laxity without metabolic
abnormalities, Bicknell et al. (2008) identified a homozygous mutation
in the ALDH18A1 gene (H784Y; 138250.0002). In vitro functional
expression studies indicated that the H784Y mutant protein retained
normal P5CS activity and did not impair proline synthesis. The findings
indicated that impaired enzymatic activity does not account for the
phenotype, as was suggested for the patients reported by Baumgartner et
al. (2000).

Skidmore et al. (2011) reported a child born of a consanguineous union
with features consistent with De Barsy syndrome (ARCL3A) with homozygous
mutation in the ALDH18A1 gene (138250.0003).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CUTIS LAXA, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE, TYPE IIIA
ALDH18A1, ARG84GLN

Baumgartner et al. (2000) determined that the 2 sibs reported by Rabier
et al. (1992) with mental retardation, joint hypermobility, skin laxity,
cataracts, and metabolic abnormalities (219150) were homozygous for a
251G-A transition of the PYCS gene, resulting in an arg84-to-gln (R84Q)
substitution. The mutation impairs the function of both the long and
short isoforms of PYCS.

.0002
CUTIS LAXA, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE, TYPE IIIA
ALDH18A1, HIS784TYR

In 4 affected sibs, born of consanguineous New Zealand Maori parents,
with mental retardation, joint hypermobility, skin laxity without
metabolic abnormalities (219150), Bicknell et al. (2008) identified a
homozygous 2350C-T transition in exon 18 of the ALDH18A1 gene, resulting
in a his784-to-tyr (H784Y) substitution in a conserved residue in the
C-terminal motif. In vitro functional expression studies indicated that
the H784Y-mutant protein retained normal P5CS activity and did not
impair proline synthesis. The findings indicated that impaired enzymatic
activity does not account for the phenotype.

.0003
CUTIS LAXA, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE, TYPE IIIA
ALDH18A1, NT1923, G-A, +1

In a severely affected child with clinical features consistent with De
Barsy syndrome (219150), born to consanguineous parents of Pakistani
origin, Skidmore et al. (2011) reported homozygosity for a G-to-A
transition at the exon 14-intron 14 boundary (nucleotide 1923+1) of the
ALDH18A1 gene. The mutation resulted in 2 anomalous transcripts that
were predicted to encode proteins lacking the catalytic site for the
enzyme. The cellular phenotype was characterized by diminished
production of collagens type I (see 120150) and III (see 120180),
altered elastin ultrastructure, and diminished cell proliferation of
cultured dermal fibroblasts. The child had lax, wrinkled, and thin skin
with dilated and tortuous subcutaneous blood vessels, corneal clouding,
and hypotonia. The child also had severe global developmental delay and
feeding difficulties, and died in infancy of unknown causes.

;;SDR FAMILY, MEMBER 1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By large scale DNA sequencing, Wu et al. (2002) cloned a novel cDNA,
designated DHRS1, from a human fetal cDNA library. The deduced 313-amino
acid DHRS1 protein has a molecular mass of 33.9 kD and contains a
short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) domain. Northern blot analysis
detected DHRS1 transcripts of 0.9 and 1.4 kb in several human tissues;
the former was most abundant in heart, and the latter most abundant in
liver.

GENE STRUCTURE

Wu et al. (2002) determined that the DHRS1 gene contains 9 exons and
spans 9.2 kb.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Wu et al. (2002) mapped the DHRS1 gene to
chromosome 14q21.3.
