603934	TITLE *603934 COACTIVATOR-ASSOCIATED ARGININE METHYLTRANSFERASE 1; CARM1
;;PROTEIN ARGININE N-METHYLTRANSFERASE 4; PRMT4
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Protein arginine N-methyltransferases, such as CARM1, catalyze the
transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosyl-L-methionine to the side
chain nitrogens of arginine residues within proteins to form methylated
arginine derivatives and S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine. Protein arginine
methylation has been implicated in signal transduction, metabolism of
nascent pre-RNA, and transcriptional activation (Frankel et al., 2002).

CLONING

Members of the p160 family of proteins, which includes SRC1 (NCOA1;
602691) and GRIP1 (NCOA2; 601993), mediate transcriptional activation by
nuclear hormone receptors. The AD2 activation domain, found in the
C-terminal region of p160 proteins, plays an important role in p160
coactivator function. Using a yeast 2-hybrid system to screen a mouse 17
day-embryo cDNA library, Chen et al. (1999) isolated a cDNA clone
encoding a 608-amino acid protein that bound to the C-terminal amino
acids of GRIP1. The central portion of the coding region had extensive
homology to a family of proteins with arginine-specific protein
methyltransferase activity. The protein, coactivator-associated arginine
methyltransferase-1 (CARM1), has a 3.8-kb mRNA that is widely but not
evenly expressed in adult mouse tissues.

Ohkura et al. (2005) identified 4 alternatively-spliced rat Carm1 cDNAs,
Carm1-v1 through Carm1-v4. The deduced proteins have between 573 and 608
amino acids. All contain the arginine methyltransferase domain and
Grip1-binding domain, but they differ in their C-terminal domains.
RT-PCR detected tissue-specific expression of the 4 transcripts.

By database analysis, Frankel et al. (2002) identified human PRMT4,
which encodes a 608-amino acid protein. The catalytic core region of
PRMT4 shares 29 to 36% amino acid identity with those of other PRMTs.

GENE FUNCTION

Because CARM1 is homologous to protein arginine methyltransferases, Chen
et al. (1999) tested it for methyltransferase activity. Protein arginine
methyltransferases transfer a methyl group from S-adenosylmethionine to
the guanidino group nitrogen atoms in arginine residues of specific
proteins. In vitro protein substrates for these enzymes include histones
(see 142711) and proteins involved in RNA metabolism such as hnRNPA1
(164017), fibrillarin (134795), and nucleolin (164035). CARM1
preferentially methylated histone H3, either in a bulk histone
preparation or in individually purified form. CARM1 coactivator function
was specific for AD2 and correlated with its ability to bind GRIP1.
CARM1 enhanced GRIP1 coactivator function for nuclear hormone receptors.
The presence of both protein methyltransferase and transcriptional
coactivator activities in CARM1 suggested that methylation of histones
or other proteins, or both, may play a role in transcriptional
regulation. CARM1 cDNA with the mutation in the putative
S-adenosylmethionine-binding domain substantially reduced both
methyltransferase and coactivator activities. In addition to GRIP1,
CARM1 was also able to interact with other members of the p160 family of
coactivators, including SRC1. Thus, coactivator-mediated methylation of
proteins in the transcription machinery may contribute to
transcriptional regulation.

Xu et al. (2001) described a molecular switch based on the controlled
methylation of nucleosomes and the transcriptional cofactors, CBP
(CREBBP; 600140)/p300 (EP300; 602700). These proteins share a
methylation site localized to an arginine residue that is essential for
stabilizing the structure of the KIX domain, which mediates CREB (CREB1;
123810) recruitment. Methylation of KIX by CARM1 blocks CREB activation
by disabling the interaction between KIX and the kinase-inducible domain
of CREB. Methylation analysis indicated that CARM1 methylates H3
acetylated nucleosomes in core histones and also, preferentially, p300.
Xu et al. (2001) concluded that CARM1 functions as a corepressor in the
cAMP signaling pathway via its methyltransferase activity while acting
as a coactivator for nuclear hormones. CARM1 thus has chromatin and
nonchromatin substrates. On the basis of in vitro and in vivo analyses,
they proposed that histone methylation plays a key role in
hormone-induced gene activation and that cofactor methylation is a
regulatory mechanism in hormone signaling. Xu et al. (2001) suggested
that their findings support the methylation 'code' hypothesis of
Jenuwein and Allis (2001).

Using systems reconstituted with recombinant chromatin templates and
coactivators, An et al. (2004) demonstrated the involvement of PRMT1
(602950) and CARM1 in p53 (191170) function; both independent and
ordered cooperative functions of p300, PRMT1, and CARM1; and mechanisms
involving direct interactions with p53 and obligatory modifications of
corresponding histone substrates. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses
confirmed the ordered accumulation of these (and other) coactivators and
cognate histone modifications on a p53-responsive gene, GADD45 (126335),
following ectopic p53 expression and/or ultraviolet irradiation.

HuR (ELAVL1; 603466) is an RNA-binding protein that stabilizes mRNAs
carrying AU-rich instability elements (AREs). Li et al. (2002) found
that mammalian Carm1 associated with HuR and activated HuR via
methylation in vitro and in vivo. HuR methylation increased in cells
that overexpressed Carm1, and lipopolysaccharide stimulation of mouse
macrophages caused increased methylation of endogenous HuR, leading to
the stabilization of TNF-alpha (TNF; 191160) mRNA.

Chen et al. (2002) demonstrated that Carm1 and Grip1 cooperatively
stimulated the activity of Mef2c (600662) in mouse mesenchymal stem
cells and found that there was direct interaction among Mef2c, Grip1,
and Carm1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated the in vivo
recruitment of Mef2 and Carm1 to the endogenous muscle creatine kinase
(CKM; 123310) promoter in a differentiation-dependent manner.
Furthermore, Carm1 was expressed in somites during mouse embryogenesis
and in the nuclei of muscle cells. Treatment of myogenic cells with a
methylation inhibitor or antisense Carm1 did not affect expression of
Myod (see MYOD1; 159970), but it inhibited differentiation and abrogated
the expression of key transcription factors myogenin (MYOG; 159980) and
Mef2 that initiate the differentiation cascade.

Ohkura et al. (2005) showed that rat Carm1-v3 associated with SNRPC
(603522) and affected 5-prime splice site selection during pre-mRNA
splicing. Carm1-v3, but not the other isoforms, stimulated a shift to
the distal 5-prime splice site of the pre-mRNA when the adenoviral E1A
minigene was used as a reporter and enhanced exons skipping in the CD44
(107269) reporter. The v3-specific C terminal and regions conserved
among the isoforms were required for this activity, but arginine
methyltransferase activity was not. Among the 4 rat Carm1 isoforms,
Carm1-v3 showed the highest activity as a cofactor for reporter activity
from an estrogen-responsive element (ERE), both in the presence and
absence of Grip1. Carm1-v1, but not Carm1-v3, showed reduced coactivator
activity from the ERE when arginine methyltransferase activity was lost.
All Carm1 variants showed comparable methylation of histone H3.

Using mouse and human cells, El Messaoudi et al. (2006) showed that
CARM1 is a regulator of cyclin E1 (CCNE1; 123837) and DHFR (126060) mRNA
expression.

By screening for methylated proteins in a mouse B-cell line, followed by
in vitro and in vivo methylation assays, Cheng et al. (2007) identified
Smb (SNRPB; 182282), Sap49 (SF3B4; 605593), U1c (SNRPC), and Ca150
(TCERG1; 605409) as splicing factors targeted by Carm1. Human CARM1
altered the patterns of exon choice in splicing a CD44 reporter minigene
and endogenous CD44 in mouse and human cell lines.

The carboxy-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II (see 180660) in mammals
undergoes extensive posttranslational modification, which is essential
for transcriptional initiation and elongation. Sims et al. (2011) showed
that the carboxy-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II is methylated at a
single arginine (R1810) by CARM1. Although methylation at R1810 is
present on the hyperphosphorylated form of RNA polymerase II in vivo,
ser2 or ser5 phosphorylation inhibits CARM1 activity toward this site in
vitro, suggesting that methylation occurs before transcription
initiation. Mutation of R1810 results in the misexpression of a variety
of small nuclear RNAs and small nucleolar RNAs, an effect that is also
observed in Carm1 -/- mouse embryo fibroblasts. Sims et al. (2011)
concluded that carboxy-terminal domain methylation facilitates the
expression of select RNAs, perhaps serving to discriminate the RNA
polymerase II-associated machinery recruited to distinct gene types.

Sanchez et al. (2013) found that Carm1 mRNA coimmunoprecipitated with
Smn1 (600354) in polyribosomes isolated from mouse motoneuron-derived
MN-1 cells. In vitro-translated human SMN1 repressed translation of
Carm1 mRNA, but had no effect on global mRNA translation, in MN-1 cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Frankel et al. (2002) determined that the CARM1 gene contains 16 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Frankel et al. (2002) mapped the CARM1
gene to chromosome 19.

ANIMAL MODEL

Yadav et al. (2003) showed that mouse embryos with a targeted disruption
of the Carm1 gene were small in size and died perinatally. The
methylation of 2 Carm1 substrates, Pabp1 (604679) and the
transcriptional cofactor p300 (602303), was abolished in knockout
embryos and cells. Furthermore, estrogen-responsive gene expression was
aberrant in Carm1 -/- fibroblasts and embryos.

600244	TITLE *600244 PROGRAMMED CELL DEATH 1; PDCD1
;;PD1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The PDCD1 gene encodes a cell surface receptor that is a member of the
B7 (see CD80; 112203)/CD28 (186760) superfamily involved in
immunomodulation. PDCD1 acts as an inhibitory molecule on T cells after
interacting with its ligands PDL1 (605402) and PDL2 (605723) (Kroner et
al., 2005).

CLONING

Programmed cell death (PCD) is essential for generation of the complex
structural and functional organization of various organs and systems in
the living organism. Most of the cells undergoing PCD require
transcriptional activation of genes that are essential for cell death.
Ishida et al. (1992) isolated cDNA encoding PD1, a cell surface membrane
protein of the immunoglobulin superfamily. In the mouse, they found that
PD1 is strongly induced in thymus when an anti-CD3 antibody is injected
and a large number of thymocytes are killed. Although the precise
function of the PD1 protein was unknown, strong correlation of its
expression with programmed cell death suggested a role in that
phenomenon. Shinohara et al. (1994) isolated and characterized the human
homolog of the mouse gene by screening a human T-cell cDNA library with
the mouse probe. The deduced amino acid sequence was 60% identical to
the mouse counterpart and a putative tyrosine kinase-association motif
was well conserved.

Finger et al. (1997) reported the complete cDNA sequence of the PDCD1
gene. The full-length cDNA is 2,106 bp long and encodes a predicted
protein of 288 amino acids. The human and mouse genes share 70% homology
at the nucleotide level and 60% homology at the amino acid level. The
mouse homolog was preferentially expressed in pro-B cells from adult
mouse bone marrow. Finger et al. (1997) concluded from these and other
data that the PDCD1 gene may play a role in B-cell differentiation
during the pro-B cell stage.

GENE FUNCTION

Freeman et al. (2000) demonstrated that the B7H1 gene (605402), which
they termed 'programmed cell death-1 ligand-1,' bound to PDCD1 and
resulted in negative regulation of lymphocyte activation. In mouse
cells, Latchman et al. (2001) demonstrated that the Pdl2 protein bound
to human PDCD1, resulting in inhibition of T-cell proliferation and
cytokine production.

Using microarray analysis and flow cytometry, Barber et al. (2006) found
that Pd1 was highly upregulated by functionally exhausted CD8 (see
186910) T cells from mice infected with a lymphocytic choriomeningitis
virus (LCMV) strain causing chronic infection, but not by functional
memory CD8 T cells from mice infected with an LCMV strain causing acute
infection. FACS analysis showed that Pd1 expression was transiently
upregulated on CD8 T cells in acutely infected mice. In contrast, Pd1
expression continued to rise and was sustained on virus-specific CD8 T
cells in chronically infected mice. Pdl1 was highly expressed on virally
infected cells. Treatment of chronically infected mice with a blocking
antibody to Pdl1 enhanced CD8 T-cell function, leading to cytotoxic
T-cell activity, production of Ifng (147570) and Tnf (191160), and
substantially reduced virus levels with no overt signs of disease. The
beneficial effects of Pdl1 blockade were also observed in mice depleted
of helper CD4 (186940) T cells. Expression of Pd1 was not affected by
anti-Pdl1 treatment, and CD8 T-cell function did not decline after
cessation of treatment. Pdl1 -/- mice chronically infected with LCMV
died due to immunopathologic damage, whereas Pdl1 -/- mice acutely
infected with LCMV behaved like wildtype mice. Barber et al. (2006)
concluded that antibody blockade of PDL1 (605402) may be an effective
immunologic strategy for treatment of chronic viral infections,
including human immunodeficiency virus, and virus-induced cancers,
although the potential for autoimmunity and immunopathology must be
carefully monitored.

To investigate the role of PD1 in a chronic human viral infection, Day
et al. (2006) examined PD1 expression from human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV)-specific CD8 T cells in 71 clade C-infected people who were naive
to anti-HIV treatments, using 10 major histocompatibility complex class
1 tetramers specific for frequently targeted epitopes. They reported
that PD1 is significantly upregulated on those cells and that expression
correlates with impaired HIV-specific CD8 T-cell function as well as
predictors of disease progression: positively with plasma viral load and
inversely with CD4 T-cell count. PD1 expression on CD4 T cells likewise
showed a positive correlation with viral load and an inverse correlation
with CD4 T-cell count, and blockade of the pathway augmented
HIV-specific CD4 and CD8 T-cell function. These data indicated that the
immunoregulatory PD1/PDL1 pathway is operative during a persistent viral
infection in humans, and defined a reversible defect in HIV-specific
T-cell function. Moreover, this pathway of reversible T-cell impairment
provides a potential target for enhancing the function of exhausted T
cells in chronic HIV infection.

Using flow cytometric analysis, Said et al. (2010) found that expression
of PD1 was upregulated on CD16 (146740)-positive and CD16-negative
monocytes, but not on dendritic cells, in viremic HIV-positive patients,
but not in highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)-treated
HIV-positive patients. PD1 upregulation in monocytes was induced by
microbial Toll-like receptor (TLR; see 603030) ligands and inflammatory
cytokines. In HIV-positive patients, PD1 expression on CD16-positive or
CD16-negative monocytes correlated with blood IL10 (124092)
concentrations. Furthermore, triggering of PD1 by PDL1, but not by PDL2,
induced monocyte IL10 production. PD1 triggering inhibited CD4-positive
T-cell responses. IL10 stimulation increased STAT3 (102582)
phosphorylation in CD4-positive T cells, and both CD4-positive and
CD8-positive T lymphocytes showed increased PD1 expression in viremic
HIV patients. Said et al. (2010) proposed that both IL10-IL10R (146933)
and PD1-PDL1 interactions need to be blocked to restore the immune
response during HIV infection.

Dai et al. (2010) noted that CD8-positive/CD122 (IL2RB; 146710)-positive
T cells have been shown to function, paradoxically, as both regulatory
and memory T cells. Using flow cytometric analysis, they demonstrated
that mouse Cd8-positive/Cd122-positive T cells included both
Pd1-positive and Pd1-negative subpopulations. Only the Pd1-positive
subpopulation suppressed T-cell responses in vitro and in vivo, and this
suppression occurred largely in an Il10-dependent manner. Il10
production, in turn, was dependent on costimulatory signaling of both
Cd28 and Pd1. Cd8-positive/Cd122-positive/Pd1-negative T cells mediated
skin graft rejection. Dai et al. (2010) concluded that
CD8-positive/CD122-positive T cells can be either regulatory or memory T
cells, depending on their PD1 expression and antigen specificity.

By analyzing gene expression in sorted CD8-positive T cells specific for
the HIV-1 Gag protein from HIV-positive individuals, Quigley et al.
(2010) showed that the PD1 inhibitory receptor coordinately upregulated
a program of genes in 'exhausted' CD8-positive T cells. The program
included upregulation of the transcription factor BATF (612476).
Enforced expression of BATF was sufficient to impair T-cell
proliferation and cytokine secretion, whereas BATF knockdown reduced PD1
inhibition. BATF silencing in T cells from individuals with chronic
viremia rescued HIV-specific T-cell function. Quigley et al. (2010)
concluded that inhibitory receptors can cause T-cell exhaustion by
upregulating genes, such as BATF, that inhibit T-cell function and may
be targets to improve T-cell immunity to HIV.

Kawamoto et al. (2012) provided evidence that the inhibitory co-receptor
PD1 regulates the gut microbiota through appropriate selection of IgA
plasma cell repertoires. PD1 deficiency generates an excess number of T
follicular helper cells with altered phenotypes, which results in
dysregulated selection of IgA precursor cells in the germinal center of
Peyer patches. Consequently, the IgAs produced in PD1-deficient mice
have reduced bacteria-binding capacity, which causes alterations of
microbial communities in the gut. Kawamoto et al. (2012) concluded that
PD1 plays a critical role in regulation of antibody diversification
required for the maintenance of intact mucosal barrier.

GENE STRUCTURE

Finger et al. (1997) determined that the PDCD1 gene contains 5 exons.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Shinohara et al. (1994) mapped
the PDCD1 gene to 2q37.3. Finger et al. (1997) confirmed the assignment
to 2q37.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Systemic lupus erythematosus is a complex autoimmune disease that
affects approximately 0.05% of the Western population, predominantly
women. A number of susceptibility loci for SLE had been suggested in
different populations. One of these susceptibility loci, SLEB2 (605218),
was reported in Nordic multicase families. Within this region, the PDCD1
gene was considered the strongest candidate for association with the
disease. Prokunina et al. (2002) analyzed 2,510 individuals, including
members of 5 independent sets of families as well as unrelated
individuals affected with SLE, for SNPs that they had identified in
PDCD1. They showed that one intronic SNP (600244.0001) was associated
with development of SLE in Europeans and Mexicans. The associated allele
of this SNP alters a binding site for the RUNT-related transcription
factor-1 (RUNX1; 151385) located in an intronic enhancer, suggesting a
mechanism through which it can contribute to the development of SLE in
humans.

Kroner et al. (2005) reported an association between the PDCD1 7146G-A
polymorphism (600244.0001) and disease progression in multiple sclerosis
(MS; 126200).

ANIMAL MODEL

Nishimura et al. (2001) generated mice deficient in PD1 by targeted
disruption. Pd1 -/- mice bred on a BALB/c background developed dilated
cardiomyopathy with severely impaired contraction and sudden death by
congestive heart failure. Affected hearts showed diffuse deposition of
immunoglobulin G on the surfaces of cardiomyocytes. All of the affected
Pd1 -/- mice exhibited high-titer circulating IgG autoantibodies
reactive to a 33-kD protein expressed specifically on the surface of
cardiomyocytes. Pd1 -/- mice bred on a BALB/c Rag2 (179616) -/-
background did not develop cardiomyopathy, suggesting that the
development of the heart disease in the BALB/c Pd1 -/- mice can be
attributed to the functions of T and/or B lymphocytes. Preliminary
studies by Nishimura et al. (2001) showed that the disease could be
successfully transferred into Rag2 -/- mice with spleen or bone marrow
cells from diseased mice. Nishimura et al. (2001) concluded that PD1 may
be an important factor contributing to the prevention of autoimmune
diseases.

Okazaki et al. (2003) followed up on the finding that mice lacking Pd1
develop autoimmune dilated cardiomyopathy, with production of high-titer
autoantibodies against a heart-specific, 30-kD protein. They purified
the protein from heart extract and identified it as cardiac troponin I,
which is encoded by the Tnni3 gene (191044). Mutation in the TNNI3 gene
can cause familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (192600). Administration
of monoclonal antibodies to Tnni3 induced dilatation and dysfunction of
hearts in wildtype mice.

Using a lethal model of histoplasmosis, Lazar-Molnar et al. (2008)
showed that all Pd1-deficient mice survived challenge with Histoplasma
capsulatum, whereas wildtype mice died with disseminated disease.
Infection induced an upregulation of Pdl on macrophages and splenocytes.
Macrophages from infected mice inhibited T-cell activation in vitro.
Antibody blocking Pd1 significantly increased survival of lethally
infected mice. Lazar-Molnar et al. (2008) concluded that the PD1-PDL
pathway has a key role in the regulation of antifungal immunity and may
be a target for immunotherapy.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS, ASSOCIATION WITH SUSCEPTIBILITY TO,

MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS, DISEASE PROGRESSION, MODIFIER OF
PDCD1, 7146G-A

Prokunina et al. (2002) identified a 7146G-A regulatory polymorphism
(see GENBANK AF363458), which they called PD-1.3, in an intronic
enhancer in the PDCD1 gene. They found an association between
susceptibility to SLE (605218) and the G allele. The presence of adenine
(A) disrupted the predicted DNA-binding site for RUNX1 (151385) in the
first repeat; specific binding occurred when guanine (G) was present at
this site. The enhancer-like structure in intron 4 of PDCD1 containing
the G/A SNP includes 4 imperfect tandem repeats containing binding sites
for transcription factors exclusively involved in hematopoietic
differentiation and inflammation, including RUNX1. Prokunina et al.
(2002) proposed that RUNX1 binds to the wildtype PDCD1 enhancer to
modulate transcription of PDCD1. On cellular activation with
self-antigen, the wildtype enhancer may provide a rapid increase in
PDCD1 expression, and PDCD1, containing an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based
inhibitory motif, inhibits autoreactive cells and preserves
self-tolerance. Disruption of the RUNX1 binding site by the presence of
adenine could lead to aberrant regulation of PDCD1, contributing to the
dysregulated self-tolerance and to the chronic lymphocyte hyperactivity
characteristic of SLE. Alternatively, the defect in PDCD1 expression may
take place during early lymphocyte development.

Among 939 German patients with multiple sclerosis (MS; 126200), Kroner
et al. (2005) reported an association between the A allele of the PD-1.3
polymorphism and disease progression. Of 94 patients with primary
progressive MS, 44% had the G/G genotype, and 53% had the A/G genotype.
Of 5 MS patients who were homozygous for the A allele, 3 had primary
progressive MS, and 1 had secondary progressive MS. In vitro studies
showed that PDCD1-mediated inhibition of T-cell activation and cytokine
secretion was impaired in cells from patients with the A allele compared
to cells from patients with only the G allele. Presence of the A allele
did not confer susceptibility to disease development.

600299	TITLE *600299 PERICENTRIOLAR MATERIAL 1; PCM1
PCM1/RET FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Balczon et al. (1994) identified a 228-kD centrosome autoantigen
designated PCM1.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a Xenopus epithelial cell line, Kubo et al. (1999) showed that
Pcm1 was not a pericentriolar material protein, but a component of
centriolar satellites, which are electron dense granules scattered
around centrosomes. Pcm1-containing centriolar satellites moved along
microtubules toward their minus ends, i.e., toward centrosomes, in
living cells and in in vitro-reconstituted asters. Immunofluorescence
microscopy of mouse nasal respiratory epithelium localized Pcm1 at the
apical cytoplasm during ciliogenesis. Electron microscopy showed Pcm1
associated exclusively with fibrous granules, which appeared to be
identical to centriolar satellites. Kubo et al. (1999) hypothesized that
PCM1-containing fibrous granules or centriolar satellites are associated
with centriolar replication.

Using several vertebrate cell lines, including human HeLa and U2OS cell
lines, Dammermann and Merdes (2002) showed that inhibition of PCM1
function by several methods reduced the targeting of centrin (see CETN1;
603187), pericentrin (see PCNT1; 170285), and ninein (608684) to
centrosomes. Inhibition or depletion of PCM1 disrupted the radial
organization of microtubules without affecting microtubule nucleation.
All these effects were also seen upon inhibition of dynactin (DCTN1;
601143) by dynamitin (DCTN2; 607376). Dammermann and Merdes (2002)
concluded that PCM1-containing centriolar satellites are involved in
microtubule- and dynactin-dependent recruitment of proteins to the
centrosome.

By coimmunoprecipitation of proteins from the human TERT-RPE1 cell line,
Kim et al. (2008) found that CEP290 (610142) interacted with PCM1. Both
proteins showed extensive overlap in their localization near centriolar
satellites. Knockdown and biochemical studies revealed that localization
of CEP290 to centriolar satellites was dependent on PCM1 and
microtubules. Conversely, depletion of CEP290 disrupted subcellular
distribution and protein complex formation of PCM1 and caused
disorganization of the cytoplasmic microtubule network. Both CEP290 and
PCM1 were required for ciliogenesis and ciliary targeting of RAB8A
(165040), a small GTPase that promotes ciliogenesis in conjunction with
the BBS protein complex (see BBS1; 209901).

The product of the schizophrenia candidate gene DISC1 (605210) binds
PCM1 and regulates its recruitment to the centrosome. Eastwood et al.
(2010) demonstrated that PCM1 immunoreactivity was localized to the
centrosome in glia of human superior temporal gyrus, but not in neurons,
which showed widespread immunoreactivity. The authors quantified
centrosomal PCM1 immunoreactivity in superior temporal gyrus glia of 81
controls and 67 subjects with schizophrenia, and genotyped the subjects
for the 2 DISC1 polymorphisms leu607 to phe (dbSNP rs6675281) and ser704
to cys (dbSNP rs821616). Centrosomal PCM1 immunoreactive area was
smaller in cys704 carriers than in ser704 homozygotes, with a similar
trend in phe607 homozygotes compared with leu607 carriers. No
differences were seen between controls and subjects with schizophrenia.
The authors concluded that DISC1 coding variants modulate centrosomal
PCM1 localization, and proposed a role for DISC1 in glial function that
may be altered in psychiatric disorders.

MAPPING

In the course of investigating the region 8p22-p21.3, commonly involved
in loss of heterozygosity in hepatocellular carcinomas, colorectal
cancers, and non-small-cell lung cancers, Ohata et al. (1994) identified
a gene that was 100% identical to the nucleotide sequences of the cDNA
for PCM1. The cosmid had previously been mapped to the 8p22-p21.3 region
by fluorescence in situ hybridization and by pulsed field gel
electrophoresis. Screening for rearrangements in Southern blots
containing DNAs of a large number of cancers of the above-mentioned 3
types failed to demonstrate obvious rearrangements; however, a HindIII
polymorphism in the PCM1 gene was found.

Using FISH, Corvi et al. (2000) confirmed the chromosomal localization
of PCM1 on 8p22-p21.

CYTOGENETICS

The RET protooncogene (164761) is often activated through somatic
rearrangements in papillary thyroid carcinomas (188550). Corvi et al.
(2000) identified a rearrangement involving the RET tyrosine kinase
domain and the 5-prime portion of PCM1. Immunohistochemistry using an
antibody specific for the C-terminal portion of PCM1 showed that the
protein level was drastically decreased and its subcellular localization
altered in papillary thyroid tumor tissue with respect to normal
thyroid.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

NHE3 (SLC9A3; 182307) is a sodium/hydrogen exchanger in the brush border
membrane of the proximal tubule, small intestine, and colon that plays a
major role in transepithelial sodium absorption. SLC9A3R2, as well as
SLC9A3R1 (604990) and protein kinase A phosphorylation, may play a role
in NHE3 regulation.

CLONING

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a HeLa cell cDNA library with SRY
(480000) as bait, Poulat et al. (1997) obtained a cDNA encoding
SLC9A3R2, which they termed SIP1. The deduced 326-amino acid protein
contains 2 highly conserved PDZ domains. Northern blot analysis revealed
wide expression of SLC9A3R2, suggesting a function not restricted to the
sex-determination process. Western blot analysis showed expression of a
34-kD protein. Binding and mutational analyses confirmed the interaction
of the PDZ domains of SLC9A3R2 with the C terminus of SRY.
Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated nuclear expression of
SLC9A3R2.

By means of a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a lung fibroblast cDNA library
with the cytoplasmic tail of NHE3 as bait, Yun et al. (1997) isolated a
cDNA encoding SLC9A3R2, which they designated E3KARP. Sequence analysis
predicted that the 337-amino acid protein is 55% identical to SLC9A3R1
(Reczek et al., 1997). Yun et al. (1997) concluded that either E3KARP or
EBP50 (SLC9A3R1) is necessary for the cAMP-dependent inhibition of NHE3.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Hall et al. (1998) determined that the DS/TxL motif at the cytoplasmic
tail of the beta-2 adrenergic receptor (ADRB2; 109690), P2Y1 (601167),
and CFTR (602421) is necessary for interaction with the first PDZ domain
of NHERF (SLC9A3R1) and NHERF2. They suggested that the presence of this
motif at the C terminus of a variety of proteins is a useful indicator
of potential NHERF binding to intracellular proteins.

Yun et al. (1998) showed that a central domain of NHE3, not a C-terminal
domain, interacts with NHERF2 through its second PDZ domain plus its C
terminus. Confocal microscopy demonstrated predominantly cytosolic
expression of NHERF2 in the absence of NHE3, with more plasma membrane
expression in the presence of NHE3. Gel overlay analysis showed that, as
seen with NHERF, the N terminus of ezrin (VIL2; 123900) interacts with
the C-terminal residues of NHERF2.

GENE FUNCTION

Mahon et al. (2002) demonstrated that parathyroid hormone receptor-1
(PTHR1; 168468) binds to the sodium/hydrogen exchanger regulatory
factors NHERF1 (604990) and NHERF2 through a PDZ-domain interaction in
vitro and in PTH target cells. NHERF2 simultaneously binds phospholipase
C-beta-1 and an atypical, carboxyl-terminal PDZ consensus motif, ETVM,
of the PTHR1 through PDZ1 and PDZ2, respectively. PTH treatment of cells
that express the NHERF2-PTH1R complex markedly activated phospholipase
C-beta and inhibits adenylylcyclase through stimulation of inhibitory G
proteins (see 139310). NHERF-mediated assembly of PTHR1 and
phospholipase C-beta is a unique mechanism to regulate PTH signaling in
cells and membranes of polarized cells that express NHERF, which may
account for many tissue- and cell-specific actions of PTH/PTH-related
protein (168470) and may also be relevant to signaling by many G
protein-coupled receptors.

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis of a human brain cDNA expression library,
DeMarco et al. (2002) found that PCMA2b (108733) interacted with NHERF2.
Coimmunoprecipitation analysis indicated that the interaction was
specific and selective, in that PCMA4b (108732) did not interact with
either NHERF2 or NHERF1, and PCMA2b preferred NHERF2 over NHERF1.
Fluorescence-tagged PCMA2b was expressed at the apical membrane of
canine kidney epithelial cells, where it colocalized with apically
targeted NHERF2. DeMarco et al. (2002) hypothesized that the
PCMA2b-NHERF2 interaction may allow the assembly of PMCA2b in a
multiprotein Ca(2+) signaling complex.

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis of a rat glomerular cDNA library, Takeda
et al. (2001) found that the PDZ-binding motif in the cytoplasmic
C-terminal tail of rat podocalyxin (PODXL; 602632) bound the second PDZ
domain of Nherf2. Immunocytochemical analysis colocalized Nherf2 with
podocalyxin and ezrin along the apical domain of the glomerular
epithelial cell membrane. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis showed that
Nherf2 and ezrin formed a multimeric complex with podocalyxin. The
complex interacted with the actin cytoskeleton, and this interaction was
disrupted in glomerular epithelial cells from rats treated with agents
that cause loss of foot processes. Takeda et al. (2001) concluded that
NHERF2 functions as a scaffold protein linking podocalyxin to ezrin and
the actin cytoskeleton.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis of the 3-prime-flanking sequence of the NTHL1 gene
(602656), Imai et al. (1998) mapped the SLC9A3R2 gene to an adjacent
region on chromosome 16p13.3.

;;La-RELATED PROTEIN; LARP;;
KIAA0731
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated human brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) cloned LARP1, which they designated
KIAA0731. The deduced protein contains 1,096 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA
detected high LARP1 expression in all tissues examined, with highest
level in heart.

Chauvet et al. (2000) cloned fly and mouse Larp, and they identified
orthologs in several species. All LARP proteins, including human LARP,
contain 2 conserved regions. The first conserved region shares homology
with La proteins (see SSB; 109090) from various species, whereas the
second conserved region is restricted to LARP proteins. In situ
hybridization of mouse embryos showed expression of Larp in dorsal root
ganglia and spinal cord, as well as in developing organs characterized
by epithelial-mesenchymal interactions.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the LARP1 gene
to chromosome 10. However, Hartz (2008) mapped the LARP1 gene to
chromosome 5q33.2 based on an alignment of the LARP1 sequence (GenBank
GENBANK AB018274) with the genomic sequence (build 36.1).

;;CYTOCHROME P450, SUBFAMILY IVF, POLYPEPTIDE 22
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database analysis, followed by RT-PCR, Lefevre et al. (2006) cloned
CYP4F22, which encodes a 531-amino acid protein with a calculated
molecular mass of about 62 kD. CYP4F22 is evolutionarily conserved,
displays 86% protein homology with rodent orthologs, and exhibits 67%
amino acid homology with CYP4F2 (604426) and CYP4F3 (601270), which are
also located in the F subfamily gene cluster on chromosome 19. RT-PCR
analysis of human tissues detected high expression in culture
keratinocytes and testis with lower expression in placenta, bone marrow,
small intestine, liver, skeletal muscle, brain, and kidney.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lefevre et al. (2006) determined that the CYP4F22 gene consists of 12
exons.

MAPPING

Lefevre et al. (2006) noted that the CYP4F22 gene maps to chromosome
19p13.12.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

By linkage analysis of 12 consanguineous families with autosomal
recessive congenital ichthyosis of the lamellar type (ARCI5; 604777),
Lefevre et al. (2006) mapped the disease locus to a 3-Mb region on
chromosome 19 (lod = 15.83 at D19S930, theta = 0.0). Lefevre et al.
(2006) identified 7 different mutations in the CYP4F22 gene (see, e.g.,
611495.0001-611495.0004) in the 12 consanguineous families. There were 5
missense mutations and 2 deletions. The phenotype usually presented as
lamellar ichthyosis and hyperlinearity of palms and soles. The authors
hypothesized that CYP4F22 plays a role in the 12(R)-lipoxygenase pathway
that has been implicated in Sjogren-Larsson syndrome (270200) and in
congenital ichthyosis (612281) due to mutation in the NIPAL4 gene
(609383).

In 4 affected individuals from a large consanguineous Israeli Druze
family with ARCI, Lugassy et al. (2008) identified homozygosity for a
nonsense mutation in the CYP4F22 gene (W521X; 611495.0005).

in the CYP4F22 gene, predicted to result in a trp521-to-ter (W521X)
substitution. The mutation segregated with disease in the family and was
not found in 50 controls.

601447	TITLE *601447 UBIQUITIN-SPECIFIC PROTEASE 5; USP5
;;ISOPEPTIDASE T; ISOT
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Ubiquitin (see 191339)-dependent proteolysis is a complex pathway of
protein metabolism implicated in such diverse cellular functions as
maintenance of chromatin structure, receptor function, and degradation
of abnormal proteins. A late step of the process involves disassembly of
the polyubiquitin chains on degraded proteins into ubiquitin monomers.
USP5 disassembles branched polyubiquitin chains by a sequential exo
mechanism, starting at the proximal end of the chain (Wilkinson et al.,
1995).

CLONING

Wilkinson et al. (1995) purified a 93-kD bovine protein with the
properties expected of a polyubiquitin disassembly protein. They
biochemically characterized the enzyme, which they called isopeptidase T
(ISOT), and cloned a cDNA encoding the human homolog (GenBank U35116).
The deduced 835-amino acid human polypeptide has a predicted molecular
mass of 93.3 kD.

Ansari-Lari et al. (1996) generated the genomic sequence of the human
CD4 gene (186940) and its neighboring region on chromosome 12 using the
large-scale shotgun sequencing strategy. A total of 117 kb of genomic
sequence and approximately 11 kb of cDNA sequence was obtained. They
identified in this sequence 8 genes, including CD4 and ISOT. Using a
battery of strategies, the exon/intron boundaries, splice variants, and
tissue expression patterns of the genes were determined. Tissue
expression analysis indicated a high level of expression of a 3.3-kb
ISOT transcript in brain, and a low level of expression in heart, lung,
spleen, and skeletal muscle. Sequence comparison showed that ISOT is a
member of the ubiquitin C-terminal hydroxylase family. Wilkinson et al.
(1995) originally cloned human ISOT and reported the sequence as 3,102
bp long. Ansari-Lari et al. (1996) stated that comparison of their cDNA
sequence with the sequence reported by Wilkinson et al. (1995) indicated
alternative splicing in exon 15. Four nucleotide differences were found
between the 2 sequences resulting in lys-to-arg and gly-to-asp
substitutions. The cDNA and genomic sequences were in full agreement.

Reyes-Turcu et al. (2006) stated that the 835-amino acid human USP5
protein contains 4 putative ubiquitin-binding domains: an N-terminal
zinc finger ubiquitin-binding domain (ZNF-UBP), a ubiquitin-specific
processing protease (UBP) domain formed by noncontiguous regions
containing the active-site cys and his boxes, and 2 ubiquitin-associated
domains (UBA1 and UBA2). UBA1 and UBA2 are located between the cys and
his boxes, which are in the central and C-terminal regions of USP5,
respectively.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Reyes-Turcu et al. (2006) reported the crystal structures of the ZNF-UBP
domain of USP5 alone and in complex with ubiquitin at 2.09-angstrom
resolution. They found that, unlike other ubiquitin-binding domains, the
ZNF-UBP domain contains a deep binding pocket where the C-terminal
diglycine motif of ubiquitin is inserted, thus explaining the
specificity of USP5 for an unmodified C terminus on the proximal subunit
of polyubiquitin. Mutation analysis showed that the ZNF-UBP domain was
required for optimal catalytic activation of USP5.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Ansari-Lari et al. (1996) mapped the USP5
gene to chromosome 12p13, near the CD4 gene (186940).

604028	TITLE *604028 SECRETION DEFICIENT 22, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF, C; SEC22C
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

SNAP (see 603215) receptors, or SNAREs, determine the specificity of the
docking and fusion of vesicles to the correct target membranes. The S.
cerevisiae Sec22, Bet1 (605456), and Bos1 SNAREs are interacting
proteins that play a role in endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi transport.
See GOSR2 (604027). By searching EST databases for sequences related to
rat SEC22A (612442), Tang et al. (1998) identified human cDNAs encoding
a protein that they designated SEC22C. Northern blot analysis revealed
that SEC22C is expressed ubiquitously as 1- and 5-kb mRNAs. The
predicted 250-amino acid SEC22C protein shares 36% and 19% sequence
identity with rat SEC22A and mouse Sec22b (604029), respectively. By
immunofluorescence of mammalian cells expressing epitope-tagged SEC22C,
Tang et al. (1998) found that SEC22C accumulated primarily at the ER. As
with Sec22b, overexpression of recombinant SEC22C protein disrupted the
localization of SNAREs involved in ER-Golgi transport, indicating that
SEC22C protein plays a role in ER-Golgi protein trafficking.

GENE FUNCTION

To fuse transport vesicles with target membranes, proteins of the SNARE
complex must be located on both the vesicle and the target membrane. In
yeast, 4 integral membrane proteins, Sed5, Bos1, Sec22, and Bet1 each
are believed to contribute a single helix to form the SNARE complex that
is needed for transport from endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi. This
generates a 4-helix bundle, which ultimately mediates the actual fusion
event. Parlati et al. (2000) explored how the anchoring arrangement of
the 4 helices affects their ability to mediate fusion. Parlati et al.
(2000) reconstituted 2 populations of phospholipid bilayer vesicles,
with the individual SNARE proteins distributed in all possible
combinations between them. Of the 8 nonredundant permutations of 4
subunits distributed over 2 vesicle populations, only 1 resulted in
membrane fusion. Fusion occurred only when the v-SNARE Bet1 is on 1
membrane and the syntaxin heavy chain Sed5 and its 2 light chains, Bos1
and Sec22, are on the other membrane, where they form a functional
t-SNARE. Thus, each SNARE protein is topologically restricted by design
to function either as a v-SNARE or as part of a t-SNARE complex.

607652	TITLE *607652 SERINE/THREONINE PROTEIN KINASE 36; STK36
;;FUSED, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF; FU;;
KIAA1278
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1999) cloned STK36, which they designated
KIAA1278. The deduced 1,311-amino acid protein shares about 55% identity
over 795 amino acids with the Drosophila 'fused' (Fu) protein. RT-PCR
ELISA detected expression of STK36 at low to moderate levels in most
tissues tested, but not in adult skeletal muscle and fetal liver.

Using Drosophila Fu as query, Murone et al. (2000) identified an EST
containing STK36, and they used this sequence to screen fetal lung and
adult testis cDNA libraries to obtain the full-length cDNA. The deduced
1,315-amino acid protein shares 55% homology with Drosophila Fu in the
N-terminal kinase domain, but only limited homology over the remaining
1,052 amino acids. Northern blot analysis detected a 5.0-kb transcript
expressed at low levels in most fetal tissues and in adult testis and
ovary. Highest expression was in testis.

GENE FUNCTION

Noting that the Drosophila Fu protein modulates the activity of
transcription factors, Murone et al. (2000) characterized the effects of
STK36 on the transcriptional activities of GLI1 (165220), GLI2 (165230),
and GLI3 (165240) in cotransfected mouse mesenchymal stem cells. STK36
did not affect the activity of GLI1 and GLI3, but strongly synergized
with GLI2. Mutation analysis indicated that STK36 lacking the kinase
domain was equally active. Murone et al. (2000) showed that SUFU
(607035) repressed the transcription-enhancing activity of STK36. STK36
coimmunoprecipitated with SUFU, GLI1, GLI2, and GLI3 in cotransfected
293 cells. In the presence of SUFU, about 3% of cells exhibited nuclear
staining of GLI1 or GLI2. When STK36 was introduced, however, about 20%
of cells possessed nuclear GLI1 or GLI2 staining. Murone et al. (2000)
concluded that STK36 controls the activity of GLI1 and GLI2 by opposing
the effect of SUFU.

Wilson et al. (2009) demonstrated that mouse Fu is essential for
construction of the central pair apparatus of motile, 9+2 cilia, and
offers a new model of human primary ciliary dyskinesia (see 244400).
They found that mouse Fu physically interacts with Kif27 (611253), a
mammalian Cos2 ortholog, and linked Fu to known structural components of
the central pair apparatus, providing evidence for the first regulatory
component involved in central pair construction. Wilson et al. (2009)
also demonstrated that zebrafish Fu is required both for hedgehog (see
600725) signaling and cilia biogenesis in Kupffer vesicle. Mouse Fu
rescued both hedgehog-dependent and -independent defects in zebrafish.
Wilson et al. (2009) concluded that their results delineated a new
pathway for central pair apparatus assembly, identified common
regulators of hedgehog signaling and motile ciliogenesis, and provided
insights into the evolution of the hedgehog cascade.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1999) mapped the STK36 gene
to chromosome 2. Murone et al. (2000) stated that they mapped the STK36
gene to chromosome 2q35, close to the PAX3 gene (606597).

ANIMAL MODEL

Fu has an essential role in hedgehog (SHH; 600725) signaling in
Drosophila, and its deletion is embryonic lethal. In contrast, Chen et
al. (2005) found that Fu-deficient mice were born at the expected
mendelian ratio. Mutant mice could not be distinguished from wildtype
littermates and appeared to develop normally. However, most Fu-deficient
mice died before 3 weeks of age, apparently of starvation. Histologic
examination showed no significant morphologic changes, and expression
studies revealed no changes in hedgehog signaling. Chen et al. (2005)
concluded that Fu does not have an essential role in hedgehog signaling
in vertebrates.

605925	TITLE *605925 PERICENTRIN; PCNT
;;KENDRIN; KEN;;
PERICENTRIN B;;
PERICENTRIN 2, FORMERLY; PCNT2, FORMERLY
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Eukaryotic chromosome segregation depends on mitotic spindle apparatus,
a bipolar array of microtubules nucleated from centrosomes. Centrosomal
microtubule nucleation requires attachment of gamma-tubulin (TUBG1;
191135) ring complexes to a salt-insoluble centrosomal core. In budding
yeast, this attachment is provided by the coiled-coil protein Spc110p,
which links the yeast gamma-tubulin complex to the core of the yeast
centrosome.

Flory et al. (2000) showed that kendrin is a human homolog of yeast
Spc110p. They identified kendrin by homology of its C-terminal
calmodulin-binding site with that of Spc110p. The N-terminal regions of
kendrin share significant sequence homology with pericentrin, a
centrosome component known to interact with gamma-tubulin. (It was later
determined that kendrin and pericentrin are identical.) Kendrin
localizes specifically to centrosomes throughout the cell cycle. In
mitotic human breast cancer cells containing abundant centrosome-like
structures, Flory et al. (2000) found kendrin only at centrosomes
associated with spindle microtubules.

By screening a human fetal liver cDNA expression library with
anti-centrosome serum, followed by 5-prime RACE and rescreening a cDNA
library with the RACE product, Li et al. (2001) isolated a cDNA encoding
kendrin, which they called pericentrin-B because of its high sequence
identity with pericentrin, then thought to be a separate protein.
Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated that kendrin is expressed in
centrosomes and is an essential component of the pericentriolar material
(PCM). Immunoblot analysis showed that kendrin is expressed as a greater
than 350-kD protein. Sequence analysis predicted that the 3,321-amino
acid protein contains a large N-terminal coiled-coil domain of
approximately 1,500 residues and a smaller C-terminal coiled-coil domain
of approximately 500 amino acids. Both coiled-coil domains are flanked
by non-coiled ends. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis
indicated that kendrin complexes with PCM1 (600299) but not with
gamma-tubulin. Functional analysis suggested that kendrin and PCM1
activities are not essential for the microtubule nucleation process.

Kantaputra et al. (2011) performed in situ hybridization analysis of
lower molar tooth expression in wildtype mice, and observed that the
first Pcnt signals were derived from tooth-presumptive epithelium at
embryonic day 9.5. Pcnt was expressed in the thickened tooth epithelium
and mesenchyme at E12.5, in the bud epithelium at embryonic day 13.5,
and in the cap epithelium and dental papillae at embryonic day 14.5,
with weak expression in both ameloblasts and odontoblasts at embryonic
day 18.5.

MAPPING

By PCR amplification, Southern blot analysis, and fluorescence in situ
hybridization, Chen et al. (1996) mapped the kendrin (PCNT) gene to 21q
between PFKL (171860) at 21q22.3 and 21qter.

GENE FUNCTION

Rauch et al. (2008) demonstrated that absence of PCNT results in
disorganized mitotic spindles and missegregation of chromosomes.

Using small interfering RNA, Graser et al. (2007) found that depletion
of pericentrin, CEP290 (610142), or CEP164 (614848) in human retinal
pigment epithelial cells prevented serum starvation-induced formation of
a primary cilium.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Individuals with microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism type
II (MOPD2; 210720) have an average birth weight of less that 1500 g at
term, an average adult height of 100 cm, a brain size comparable to that
of a 3-month old but usually with near-normal intelligence, and a
variety of associated bone abnormalities. Rauch et al. (2008) identified
29 different homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the PCNT
gene in 25 patients with MOPD2. There were 12 stop mutations and 17
frameshift mutations (4 splice site mutations, 2 small insertions, 2
small deletions, and 1 exon deletion). Two mutations occurred twice in
unrelated patients, namely, R1923X (605925.0004) and 841insG
(605925.0005). In contrast, they identified no PCNT mutations in 27
patients with a clinical diagnosis of MOPD1 (210710), MOPD3 (210730),
Seckel syndrome (see 210600), or unclassified growth retardation
syndromes. Absence of the PCNT protein was confirmed by Western blot
analysis of lymphoblastoid cell lines from 2 patients, and both
investigated heterozygous parents of 1 of these patients showed reduced
protein levels in lymphoblasts. Rauch et al. (2008) suggested that this
may explain their finding of significant reduction of the mean height of
heterozygous MOPD II parents.

Griffith et al. (2008) performed a SNP-microarray genomewide
homozygosity scan on 2 consanguineous families from the Middle East that
included individuals clinically diagnosed with Seckel syndrome and
showing cellular evidence of defective ATR signaling (601215). They
mapped the disorder in these families to chromosome 21q22.3 in the
region of the PCNT gene. By sequencing the 47 coding exons of the PCNT
gene in affected individuals from the 2 Middle Eastern families, they
identified homozygous truncating mutations in both: E220X (605925.0001)
in one and S629fs (605925.0002) in the other. From screening of
additional cases, they identified another truncating mutation in the
PCNT gene (605925.0003) in a consanguineous Moroccan family.

Willems et al. (2008) noted that mutations in the PCNT gene had been
identified in 28 patients, including the 25 with MOPD II reported by
Rauch et al. (2008) and the 3 diagnosed with Seckel syndrome reported by
Griffith et al. (2008). They performed direct sequencing of PCNT in 21
patients and identified 9 distinct mutations in 4 of the 16 patients
diagnosed with Seckel syndrome and in all 5 patients diagnosed with MOPD
II. Clinical analysis of the 4 Seckel syndrome patients with PCNT
mutations showed that all presented minor skeletal changes and a severe
growth retardation more suggestive of MOPD II. Willems et al. (2008)
concluded that, despite variable clinical severity, MOPD II is a
genetically homogeneous condition due to loss of function of
pericentrin. Thus, the patients reported by Griffith et al. (2008) with
mutations in the PCNT gene can be considered to have MOPD II. In their
full report, in which additional patients were studied, Willems et al.
(2010) identified a total of 13 distinct mutations in the PCNT gene,
including one in another patient diagnosed with Seckel syndrome
(605925.0009); this patient also had minor skeletal changes and clinical
features compatible with a diagnosis of MOPD II.

In a 3-year-old Italian boy who was diagnosed at birth with Seckel
syndrome but in whom the diagnosis was later revised to MOPD II, Piane
et al. (2009) identified homozygosity for a 1-bp insertion in the PCNT
gene (605295.0012). Noting the phenotypic overlap between Seckel
syndrome and MOPD II, the authors emphasized the need for reevaluation
in patients since certain clinical features may not be evident at birth;
they considered PCNT mutations to be the hallmark for a correct
diagnosis of MOPD II.

In 4 patients from 2 unrelated Thai pedigrees with features of MOPD II
as well as extreme microdontia and alveolar bone hypoplasia, Kantaputra
et al. (2011) identified homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for
mutations in the PCNT gene (605925.0004; 605925.0010-605925.0011).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MICROCEPHALIC OSTEODYSPLASTIC PRIMORDIAL DWARFISM, TYPE II
PCNT, GLU220TER

In affected male and female members of a consanguineous Saudi Arabian
family who had been diagnosed with Seckel syndrome (210600), Griffith et
al. (2008) identified homozygosity for a glu220-to-ter (E220X) mutation
in the PCNT gene. Both patients were born at 33 weeks' gestation and
were small at birth. One of them had diabetes mellitus. The parents in
each case were heterozygous for the mutation, which was not found in
over 200 control alleles. Willems et al. (2008) later reported that
patients with mutations in the PCNT gene have type II microcephalic
osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism (210720), a clinically variable but
genetically homogeneous condition.

MICROCEPHALIC OSTEODYSPLASTIC PRIMORDIAL DWARFISM, TYPE II
PCNT, SER629FS

In a female diagnosed with Seckel syndrome (210600), born of
first-cousin parents in Kuwait, Griffith et al. (2008) identified
homozygosity for a single-basepair deletion in exon 12 of the PCNT gene
that led to a frameshift which was predicted to result in premature
protein termination after an additional 65 amino acids (S629fs). The
parents were heterozygous for the mutation, which was not found in over
200 control alleles. Willems et al. (2008) later reported that patients
with mutations in the PCNT gene have type II microcephalic
osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism (210720), a clinically variable but
genetically homogeneous condition.

MICROCEPHALIC OSTEODYSPLASTIC PRIMORDIAL DWARFISM, TYPE II
PCNT, CYS1190FS

In a male diagnosed with Seckel syndrome (210600), born of first-cousin
parents in Morocco, Griffith et al. (2008) identified homozygosity for a
1-bp insertion in exon 18 of the PCNT gene, resulting in a frameshift at
codon 1190 (C1190fs). The parents were heterozygous for the mutation,
which was not found in over 200 control alleles. Willems et al. (2008)
later reported that patients with mutations in the PCNT gene have type
II microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism (210720), a
clinically variable but genetically homogeneous condition.

MICROCEPHALIC OSTEODYSPLASTIC PRIMORDIAL DWARFISM, TYPE II
PCNT, ARG1923TER

In 2 patients with microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism
type II (MOPD2; 210720) from consanguineous but unrelated families, one
of Omani descent and the other of Pakistani descent, Rauch et al. (2008)
identified homozygosity for a 5767C-T transition in the PCNT gene,
resulting in an arg1923-to-ter (R1923X) substitution. The patients, aged
5.5 and 1.5 years, were born prematurely, one at 34 and the other at 32
weeks' gestation, with severe intrauterine growth retardation. Both had
severe short stature, extreme microcephaly, and mild developmental
delay.

In a Thai brother and sister with features of MOPD II as well as extreme
microdontia and alveolar bone hypoplasia, originally reported by
Kantaputra (2002), Kantaputra et al. (2011) identified compound
heterozygosity for the R1923X mutation in the PCNT gene and a 3-bp
deletion (9460delAAG; 605925.0010) in exon 43, predicted to result in
deletion of lys315.

MICROCEPHALIC OSTEODYSPLASTIC PRIMORDIAL DWARFISM, TYPE II
PCNT, 1-BP INS, 841G

In 2 presumably unrelated Turkish patients with microcephalic
osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism type II (MOPD2; 210720), one from a
consanguineous and the other from an apparently nonconsanguineous union,
Rauch et al. (2008) identified homozygosity for a 1-bp insertion,
841_842insG, resulting in a frameshift at arg281 and a termination codon
at position 327 (R281fsX327). The patient from the nonconsanguineous
union was born at 35 weeks' gestation weighing 1300 g, and the other
patient was born at 40 weeks' gestation weighing 1320 g. The patients,
aged 12 and 5.5 years, had severe short stature and extreme microcephaly
with mild developmental delay. Both also had multiple brain aneurysms
and moyamoya disease (see 252350). Further analyses suggested that this
mutation was transmitted through an unknown common ancestor because both
patients were identical for all polymorphic sites identified within the
PCNT region.

PCNT, GLU1037TER

In a 12-year-old Turkish girl with microcephalic osteodysplastic
primordial dwarfism type II (210720), whose parents were consanguineous,
Rauch et al. (2008) identified homozygosity for a 3109G-T transversion
in the PCNT gene, resulting in a glu1037-to-ter (E1037X) substitution.
The child was born at 34 weeks' gestation weighing only 880 g. She had
severe short stature, extreme microcephaly, multiple brain aneurysms,
moyamoya disease, and mild developmental delay.

In a male patient from Turkey with the diagnosis of MOPD II, Willems et
al. (2010) identified homozygosity for the E1037X mutation.

PCNT, 486-BP DEL, NT84

In a 12.5-year-old girl of consanguineous Kurdish descent with
microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism type II (210720),
Rauch et al. (2008) identified homozygosity for a large deletion
extending from IVS30 at nucleotide 84 to IVS34 at nucleotide 569, which
resulted in a frameshift leading to a premature termination codon at
amino acid 2317 (IVS30-84_IVS31-569del). The child was born at term
weighing 1200 g. She was -9 SD in height and -8.7 SD for head
circumference. She had moyamoya disease and no developmental delay.

family, Rauch et al. (2008) identified homozygosity for an 8752C-T
transition in the PCNT gene, resulting in an arg2918-to-ter (R2918X)
substitution. The children showed severe intrauterine growth retardation
at birth with extreme short stature and microcephaly. Both had enlarged
ventricles and both showed severe developmental delay.

.0009
MICROCEPHALIC OSTEODYSPLASTIC PRIMORDIAL DWARFISM, TYPE II
PCNT, GLN1280HIS

In a patient with the diagnosis of Seckel syndrome, Willems et al.
(2010) identified homozygosity for a 3840G-C transversion affecting the
last base of exon 19 of the PCNT gene, resulting in an apparent missense
mutation, gln1280-to-his (Q2280H). The mutation was predicted to alter
splicing. This was confirmed by sequence analysis of RT-PCR products
which demonstrated exon 19 skipping, predictive of a premature
termination of translation (Pro1204GlyfsX11). The clinical analysis of
this patient showed that she presented minor skeletal changes and
clinical features compatible with the diagnosis of MOPD II.

In male and female third cousins with features of MOPD II (210720) as
well as extreme microdontia and alveolar bone hypoplasia, originally
reported by Kantaputra et al. (2004), Kantaputra et al. (2011)
identified homozygosity for a 3460G-T transversion in exon 17 of the
PCNT gene, resulting in a glu1154-to-ter (E1154X) substitution predicted
to cause premature termination of the protein. The unaffected parents
were each heterozygous for the mutation.

PCNT, 1-BP INS, 1527A

In a 3-year-old Italian boy with microcephalic osteodysplastic
primordial dwarfism type II (210720), Piane et al. (2009) identified
homozygosity for a 1-bp insertion (1527_1528insA) in exon 10 of the PCNT
gene, causing a frameshift predicted to result in a premature
termination codon (Thr510fs). (The protein change was incorrectly
published as Treo510fs.) His unaffected parents were heterozygous for
the mutation.

165162	TITLE *165162 ONCOGENE JUN-D; JUND
DESCRIPTION 
GENE FUNCTION

JUND is the most broadly expressed member of the JUN family and the AP1
transcription factor complex (see 165160). Weitzman et al. (2000) found
that primary fibroblasts lacking murine Jund displayed p53
(191170)-dependent growth arrest, upregulated p19(ARF) (see 600160)
expression, and premature senescence. In contrast, immortalized cell
lines lacking Jund showed increased proliferation and higher cyclin D1
(CCND1; 168461) levels. These properties were reminiscent of the effects
of oncogenic RAS (190020) expression on primary and established cell
cultures. Furthermore, Jund -/- fibroblasts exhibited increased
p53-dependent apoptosis upon ultraviolet irradiation and were sensitive
to the cytotoxic effects of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF; 191160).
The antiapoptotic role of JUND was confirmed using an in vivo model of
TNF-mediated hepatitis. The authors proposed that JUND protects cells
from senescence, or apoptotic responses to stress stimuli, by acting as
a modulator of the signaling pathways that link RAS to p53.

Gerald et al. (2004) found that mouse Jund reduced tumor angiogenesis by
limiting Ras-mediated production of reactive oxygen species. Using
Jund-deficient cells, they showed that Jund regulates genes involved in
antioxidant defense, H2O2 production, and angiogenesis. Accumulation of
H2O2 in Jund -/- cells decreased the availability of Fe(II) and reduced
the activity of HIF-prolyl hydroxylases (see 606424) that target
hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) alpha subunits (e.g., HIF1A; 603348) for
degradation. Subsequently, HIF-alpha proteins accumulated and enhanced
transcription of Vegfa (192240), a potent proangiogenic factor. Gerald
et al. (2004) concluded that their findings reveal the mechanism by
which JUND protects cells from oxidative stress and exerts an
antiangiogenic effect.

Behmoaras et al. (2008) demonstrated by combined congenic, linkage, and
microarray studies that the activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcription
factor JunD is a major determinant of macrophage activity and is
associated with glomerulonephritis susceptibility. Introgression of the
rat crescentic glomerulonephritis locus Crgn2 from the nonsusceptible
Lewis strain onto the Wistar Kyoto rat background led to significant
reductions in crescent formation, macrophage infiltration, Fc
receptor-mediated macrophage activation, and cytokine production.
Haplotype analysis restricted the Crgn2 linkage interval to a 430-kb
interval containing Jund, which is markedly overexpressed in Wistar
Kyoto macrophages and glomeruli. JunD knockdown in rat and human primary
macrophages led to significantly reduced macrophage activity and
cytokine secretion, indicating conservation of JunD function in
macrophage activation in rats and human and suggesting in vivo
inhibition of JunD as a possible therapeutic strategy for diseases
characterized by inflammation and macrophage activation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Sullivan et al. (1999) found that the JUND gene contains no introns.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Trask et al. (1993) assigned the
JUND gene to 19p13.1-p12. Sullivan et al. (1999) determined that the
JUND gene is located about 27 kb proximal to PDE4C (600128).

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Huang et al. (2012) reported the crystal structures of human menin
(613733) in its free form and in complexes with MLL1 (159555) or with
JUND, or with an MLL1-LEDGF (603620) heterodimer. These structures show
that menin contains a deep pocket that binds short peptides of MLL1 or
JUND in the same manner, but that it can have opposite effects on
transcription. The menin-JUND interaction blocks JUN N-terminal
kinase-mediated JUND phosphorylation and suppresses JUND-induced
transcription. In contrast, menin promotes gene transcription by binding
the transcription activator MLL1 through the peptide pocket while still
interacting with the chromatin-anchoring protein LEDGF at a distinct
surface formed by both menin and MLL1.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using Jund knockout mice and an experimental model of chronic renal
injury (75% nephron reduction), Pillebout et al. (2003) demonstrated
that Jund was not required for the initial compensatory growth phase but
was essential to inhibit a second wave of cell proliferation and to halt
the development of renal lesions. They also showed that the effects of
Jund inactivation involve upregulation of the paracrine mitogen
transforming growth factor-alpha (TGFA; 190170), and suggested that JUND
is part of a regulatory network that controls proliferation to prevent
pathologic progression in chronic renal diseases.

612969	TITLE *612969 TIGGER TRANSPOSABLE ELEMENT-DERIVED GENE 7; TIGD7
;;SANCHO
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

DNA transposons, such as Tiggers, are repetitive elements that move in
the genome by excision and reintegration without an RNA intermediate.
TIGD7 belongs to a family of genes derived from Tiggers (Smit and Riggs,
1996; Dou et al., 2004). For further information on Tiggers, see TIGD1
(612972).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a fetal brain cDNA library, Dou et
al. (2004) cloned full-length TIGD7. The deduced 511-amino acid protein
has a calculated molecular mass of 55.6 kD. Like other Tigger subfamily
proteins, TIGD7 contains a DDE domain, which is involved in catalysis of
DNA cleavage and the subsequent strand transfer reaction, and CENPBN and
CENPB domains, which are involved in DNA binding. PCR analysis detected
TIGD7 in all tissues examined, with highest expression in testis and
ovary. Database analysis suggested the existence of TIGD7 splice
variants.

GENE STRUCTURE

Dou et al. (2004) determined that the TIGD7 gene contains 2 exons and
spans 11.2 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Dou et al. (2004) mapped the TIGD7 gene to
chromosome 16p13.

611435	TITLE *611435 DOCKING PROTEIN 3; DOK3
;;DOK-LIKE PROTEIN; DOKL
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis using Abl (ABL1; 189980) as bait, followed by
5-prime RACE of a mouse liver cDNA library, Cong et al. (1999) cloned
mouse Dok3, which they called Dokl. The deduced 444-amino acid mouse
protein contains an N-terminal PH domain, a central PTB domain, and a
proline-rich C-terminal domain. Dokl is relatively serine/threonine-rich
overall and contains several potential phosphorylation sites for ser/thr
protein kinases. Dokl shares 60% and 57% sequence similarity with p62dok
(DOK1; 602919) over the PH and PTB domains, respectively, with lower
similarity over the C-terminal regions. Northern blot analysis of mouse
tissues detected several species with high expression in spleen and lung
and low levels in other tissues. RNAse protection studies detected very
high Dokl expression in bone marrow and spleen, low expression in
thymus, and no expression in NIH3T3 cells. Immunofluorescence studies
localized Dokl to the cytoplasm in NIH3T3 cells.

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis using Csk (124095) as bait, followed by
5-prime RACE of a mouse fetal thymus cDNA library, Lemay et al. (2000)
independently cloned mouse Dok3. RNAse protection assay of mouse tissues
detected high expression in spleen and bone marrow but not in thymus,
with little or no expression in nonlymphoid organs.

MAPPING

Berger et al. (2010) stated that the DOK3 gene maps to chromosome
5q35.3.

GENE FUNCTION

Using yeast 2-hybrid and immunoprecipitation analysis of Dokl and Abl
mutants, Cong et al. (1999) showed that the Dokl PTB domain bound
phosphotyrosines on Abl in a kinase-dependent manner. In addition, the
Dokl PTB domain bound weakly to insulin receptor (INSR; 147670).
Immunoprecipitation and phosphorylation studies showed that Dokl served
as a substrate for phosphorylation by v-Abl, c-Abl, and Bcr-Abl (see
BCR; 151410). Overexpression of Dokl inhibited v-Abl-dependent
activation of MAPK1 (176948) and v-Abl transforming activity.

Lemay et al. (2000) showed that, in response to immunoreceptor
stimulation, Dok3 was tyrosine phosphorylated by Src (190090) family
members Lck (153390), Fyn (137025), and Lyn (165120).
Immunoprecipitation studies showed that Dok3 bound inhibitors SHIP
(INPP5D; 601582) and Csk (124095) but did not bind RasGAP (RASA1;
139150). Dok3 binding to SHIP occurred via the SH2 domain. Dok3 also
bound Csk via the Csk SH2 domain with possible involvement of the Csk
SH3 domain as well. Overexpression of Dok3 in a murine B-cell line
inhibited immunoreceptor-mediated NFAT (see 600490) activation. Lemay et
al. (2000) concluded that Dok3 acts as an adaptor in the recruitment of
inhibitory molecules and may play a role in negative regulation of
immunoreceptor signaling in hematopoietic cells.

Using a constitutively active form of Src, Honma et al. (2006)
identified Grb2 (108355) as a protein that bound Dok3 downstream of its
tyrosine phosphorylation. Dok3 sequestered Grb2 from Shc (600560),
resulting in negative regulation of the Ras-Erk pathway.

ANIMAL MODEL

Berger et al. (2010) found that mice with knockout of Dok1 (602919),
Dok2 (604997), or Dok3 each developed lung adenocarcinoma (211980). Mice
with double-knockouts of different combinations of these 3 genes
developed lung adenocarcinoma at an earlier age and with high
penetrance, suggesting that the proteins have partially redundant or
overlapping functions. Compared to wildtype lung tissue, Dok-mutant
tumors showed moderate staining for phosphorylated Akt (164730) and
strong staining for phosphorylated Erk (176872). Immunohistochemical
studies on isolated cells showed that the tumor cells arose from a
population of bronchioalveolar stem cells with inactivation of the Dok
proteins. These findings were consistent with a model of tumorigenesis
in which inactivation of the Dok1, Dok2, and Dok3 genes leads to
hyperactivation of Akt and Erk, and an expansion of the stem cells that
differentiate into alveolar type II cells.

DESCRIPTION Boyer (1961, 1963) described an electrophoretic variant of alkaline
phosphatase (orthophosphoric monoester phosphohydrolase, alkaline
optimum; EC 3.1.3.1), which appears in the serum during pregnancy in
some women, and demonstrated its origin in the placenta. Since the human
placenta is largely fetal in origin, the polymorphism may be a
characteristic determined by the fetal genotype. Historically, this was
the first described example of a polymorphic placental protein. Robson
and Harris (1965) studied the genetics. Beckman et al. (1967) found a
rare phenotype, absence of placental alkaline phosphatase, in twins and
suggested that these twins might be homozygous for a 'silent allele'
('null allele'). The twins were also concordant for Crouzon craniofacial
dysostosis (123500), raising the question of a causal relationship.
Palmarino et al. (1979) found evidence for at least 11 different mutant
alleles at the placental alkaline phosphatase locus. Garattini et al.
(1985) demonstrated 'appreciable amounts' of placental alkaline
phosphatase in extracts of liver and intestine. Kam et al. (1985) cloned
placental alkaline phosphatase cDNA, sequenced it, and mapped the gene
by direct spot-blot hybridization to the DNA of chromosomes resolved by
dual laser chromosome sorting. A strong signal was obtained with
chromosome 2. With longer exposure, a weaker signal appeared also on
chromosome 17. They speculated that PLAP-related gene(s) may be located
there. Human testis and thymus contain small amounts of an ALP closely
resembling, but not identical to, placental ALP. This ALP has been
referred to as placentallike ALP or the Nagao isoenzyme (Henthorn et
al., 1987); see 171810. Millan and Stigbrand (1983) maintained that
placentallike ALP was probably the product of a separate locus.

Martin et al. (1987) used a cDNA probe in Southern blot analysis of
somatic cell hybrid DNA and in situ hybridization to locate PLAP to
2q37. Martin et al. (1987) described a RFLP of the PLAP gene. Griffin et
al. (1987) mapped both the placental and the intestinal alkaline
phosphatase genes to 2q34-q37 by chromosomal in situ hybridization and
hybridization to the DNA of somatic cell hybrids. By in situ
hybridization, Raimondi et al. (1988) assigned the ALPP gene to 2q37.
Knoll et al. (1988) concluded that 3 closely related alkaline
phosphatase genes reside on the long arm of chromosome 2 in man. One of
these genes (PLAP; the placental ALP-1, in their symbology) encodes the
classic heat-stabile placental alkaline phosphatase; a second (which
they referred to as placental ALP-2) is closely related to the first,
and may encode the so-called placental ALP-like enzyme of the testis and
thymus; the third member of this gene family, the intestinal ALP gene,
encodes intestinal alkaline phosphatase (171740). The expression of the
intestinal and placental genes is highly tissue-specific in spite of
nearly 90% sequence similarity within their exons. Knoll et al. (1988)
compared the placental alkaline phosphatase gene with the placentallike
gene.

Data on gene frequencies of allelic variants were tabulated by
Roychoudhury and Nei (1988).

Henthorn et al. (1986) determined the amino-terminal amino acid
sequences of the products of 3 common alleles at the PLAP locus. The
sequences differed at position 3, which was found to be proline in the
products of ALPP*1 and ALPP*2 (also called types 1 and 2) but leucine in
the product of ALPP*3 (also called type 3). From cDNA libraries, clones
covering the coding regions of types 1 and 3 cDNAs were isolated.
Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of type 1 (also called S)
and type 3 proteins showed 7 differences out of 513 amino acids, each
due to a single base substitution. cDNA sequence comparisons showed 3
silent substitutions in coding regions and 3 base differences in the
greater than 1 kb stretch of 3-prime untranslated sequences. Thus, a
remarkable degree of allelic variation was found. The differences
between type 1 and type 3 were pro3-to-leu, met44-to-val, arg241-to-his,
gln255-to-arg, thr263-to-ala, tyr367-to-cys, and ser372-to-gly,
respectively.

602513	TITLE *602513 REGULATOR OF G PROTEIN SIGNALING 14; RGS14
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Members of the 'regulator of G protein signaling' (RGS) gene family
encode proteins that downregulate signaling by heterotrimeric G
proteins. See 602189 for background. By PCR on rat glioma cell cDNA
using primers based on the conserved RGS domain, Snow et al. (1997)
identified 2 novel cDNAs, Rgs12 (602512) and Rgs14. The Rgs14 cDNA
encodes a predicted 544-amino acid protein. Northern blot analysis
showed 2.5- and 3-kb Rgs14 transcripts at high levels in brain, spleen,
and lung and at very low levels in other tissues. Snow et al. (1997)
identified human ESTs that are highly homologous to Rgs14 and that map
to chromosome 5, between marker D52006 and 5qter.

Using the yeast 2-hybrid system, Traver et al. (2000) isolated a mouse
brain cDNA encoding a protein that interacts with both Rap1a (179520)
and Rap2 (179540) but not with Ras (190020). Sequence analysis revealed
that the protein is 96% identical to rat Rgs14. Mutation analysis
defined the Rap-interacting domain between residues 300 to 427. Binding
analysis demonstrated that Rgs14 interacts preferentially with the
G-alpha-o (139311) subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins to stimulate
GTPase activity. Northern blot and Western blot analysis detected strong
expression restricted to brain and spleen of a 65-kD, primarily
cytosolic protein. In situ hybridization analysis showed coexpression of
G-alpha-o and Rgs14, as well as Rgs14 and Rap2 but not Rap1, in various
brain regions, particularly the hippocampus, late in embryonic
development. Traver et al. (2000) suggested that Rgs14 may constitute a
bridging molecule that allows cross-regulation of signaling pathways
downstream from G protein-coupled receptors.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Heterotrimeric G proteins bind to cell surface receptors and are
integral in transmission of signals from outside the cell. Upon
activation of the G-alpha subunit by binding of GTP, the G-alpha and
G-beta-gamma subunits dissociate and interact with effector proteins for
signal transduction. Regulatory proteins with the 19-amino acid GoLoco
motif, described by Takesono et al. (1999), can bind to G-alpha subunits
and maintain G protein subunit dissociation in the absence of G-alpha
activation. Kimple et al. (2002) described the structural determinants
of GoLoco activity as revealed by the crystal structure of G-alpha-i1
(139310)-GDP bound to the GoLoco region of RGS14. They described key
contacts between the GoLoco motif and G-alpha protein, including the
extension of GoLoco's highly conserved Asp/Glu-Gln-Arg triad into the
nucleotide-binding pocket of G-alpha to make direct contact with the GDP
alpha- and beta-phosphates. The structural organization of the
GoLoco-G-alpha-i1 complex suggests that the G-alpha all-helical domain
and GoLoco region carboxy-terminal residues control the specificity of
GoLoco-G-alpha interactions.

GENE STRUCTURE

Sierra et al. (2002) determined that RGS14 contains 15 exons and spans
more than 16 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Sierra et al. (2002) mapped the RGS14 gene
to chromosome 5q35.3. They mapped the mouse Rgs14 gene to chromosome 13
by interspecific backcross mapping.

;;ADAPTIN, DELTA;;
GARNET, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF;;
MOCHA, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

AP3D1 is a subunit of the AP3 adaptor-like complex, which is not
associated with clathrin. The AP3D1 subunit is implicated in
intracellular biogenesis and trafficking of pigment granules and
possibly platelet dense granules and neurotransmitter vesicles.

CLONING

Using homology with the alpha- (see AP2A1; 601026) and gamma-adaptins
(see AP1G1; 603533) of the AP2 and AP1 complexes, respectively, Simpson
et al. (1997) identified an EST clone of AP3D1, and they obtained the
full-length cDNA by screening a heart cDNA library. The predicted
1,112-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 125 kD and
contains an N-terminal domain, a highly hydrophilic linker or 'hinge'
domain, and a C-terminal 'ear' domain. It also has a WIIGEY consensus
sequence found in adaptins and in beta-COP (600959). AP3D1 shares only
about 15% identity with the alpha- and gamma-adaptins, and the homology
is restricted to the extreme N-terminal portion. AP3D1 shares 96%
identity with the homologous Drosophila 'garnet' protein across an
N-terminal 100-amino acid stretch. Using coimmunoprecipitation of pig
brain cytosol, Simpson et al. (1997) determined that AP3D1, beta-3 (see
AP3B1; 603401), sigma-3 (see AP3S1; 601507), and mu-3 (see AP3M1;
610366), but not gamma-adaptins, interact in AP3 complexes.
Immunofluorescence localization of AP3D1 showed colocalization with
AP3B. Endogenous AP3 complexes showed perinuclear staining with punctate
labeling extending to the cell periphery. Staining did not colocalize
with endosomal or trans-Golgi markers, nor did it colocalize with
clathrin.

Ooi et al. (1997) independently cloned AP3D1 based on sequence
similarity with the alpha- and gamma-adaptins. The predicted 1,153-amino
acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 130 kD. Ooi et al.
(1997) noted that a C-terminal extension results in the hinge/ear domain
being about 2-fold larger than those of the alpha- and gamma-adaptins.
They also identified 3 variants containing in-frame deletions. Northern
blot analysis revealed a 5-kb transcript in all tissues examined, with
highest expression in skeletal muscle, heart, pancreas, and testis. A
minor 5.5-kb transcript was detected in skeletal muscle and heart, and a
minor 4-kb transcript was detected in testis. Coimmunoprecipitations of
human fibroblasts confirmed that AP3D1 interacts with the other subunits
of the AP3 complex. Western blot analysis of AP3 complex affinity
purified from Jurkat cell cytosol showed AP3D1 to have an apparent
molecular mass of 160 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a yeast 2-hybrid assay, Lefrancois et al. (2004) determined that
the ear domain of the AP3 delta subunit (AP3D1) interacts with both
isoforms of the sigma-3 subunit, sigma-3A (AP3S1) and sigma-3B (AP3S2;
602416). An extended C-terminal segment of sigma-3 was necessary for the
interaction with the delta subunit. The delta-sigma-3 interaction
interfered with the binding of AP3 to ARF (see 103180), but not with its
binding to dileucine-based sorting signals. As a consequence, the delta
subunit ear inhibited the recruitment of AP3 to membranes both in vitro
and in vivo and impaired the sorting of lysosomal membrane proteins.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Consortium mapped the AP3D1 gene to
chromosome 19 (TMAP stSG50005). Kantheti et al. (1998) mapped the mouse
Ap3d1 gene to chromosome 10 in a region showing homology of synteny to
human chromosome 19p13.3.

ANIMAL MODEL

Simpson et al. (1997) and Ooi et al. (1997) showed that the garnet
mutation in Drosophila, which causes reduced pigmentation of the eyes
and other tissues, results from a mutation in the fly Ap3d1 gene.

The 'mocha' mouse mutant, a model for Hermansky-Pudlack syndrome
(203300), shows coat and eye color dilution, reduced levels of renal
lysosomal enzymes in urine, and prolonged bleeding due to storage pool
deficiency in the dense granules of platelets. Mocha mice have balance
problems due to otolith defects and eventually become deaf. They are
also hyperactive and have a unique hypersynchronized 6- to 7-Hz
electrocortigram. By Southern blot analysis of restriction digests of
mocha mouse DNA, Kantheti et al. (1998) determined that mocha is a null
allele of the Ap3d1 gene. They observed a lack of AP3 in mocha tissues
and reduced levels of the zinc transporter Znt3 (SLC30A3; 602878) in
brain, resulting in a lack of zinc-associated Timm historeactivity in
hippocampal mossy fibers.

603198	TITLE *603198 RNA POLYMERASE I AND TRANSCRIPT RELEASE FACTOR; PTRF
;;CAVIN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The PTRF gene encodes cavin, an essential factor in the biogenesis of
caveolae, which are 50- to 100-nm invaginations of cell-surface
membranes putatively involved in numerous processes, including signal
transduction and membrane and lipid trafficking (summary by Liu et al.,
2008).

CLONING

Termination of RNA polymerase I (Pol I; see 602000) transcription is a
2-step process that involves pausing of transcription elongation
complexes and release of both the pre-rRNA and Pol I from the template.
In mouse, pausing is mediated by Ttf1 (see 600777). Mason et al. (1997)
demonstrated that an additional trans-acting factor is required for
dissociation of the paused complex. Jansa et al. (1998) designated this
factor PTRF for 'Pol I and transcript release factor'. Using a yeast
2-hybrid screen with mouse Ttf1 as the bait, these authors isolated a
partial human cDNA encoding PTRF. They cloned a full-length mouse Ptrf
cDNA using a PCR-based approach. The predicted mouse and truncated human
PTRF proteins are 94% identical.

By Northern blot analysis, Miyoshi et al. (2001) determined that the
mouse Ptrf gene is expressed as a 3.2-kb transcript. Highest expression
was detected in lung and heart, with lower levels in all other tissues
examined.

Hayashi et al. (2009) noted that the PTRF gene encodes a 390-amino acid
protein. Immunoblotting detected PTRF as an approximately 50-kD band in
human muscle and 3T3 cells. In C2C12 myoblasts cotransfected with PTRF
and caveolin-3 (CAV3; 601253) or caveolin-1 (CAV1; 601047), PTRF was
detected at the cell membrane and colocalized with CAV3.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hayashi et al. (2009) noted that the PTRF gene contains 2 coding exons.
Miyoshi et al. (2001) determined that the mouse Ptrf gene contains 2
exons and spans 12 kb.

MAPPING

Miyoshi et al. (2001) mapped the mouse Ptrf gene to chromosome 11. The
order and orientation of genes at this locus, Ptrf--Stat3
(102582)--Stat5a (601511)--Stat5b (604260)--Lgp1 (608587)--Hcrt
(602358), are identical in the syntenic region of human chromosome
17q21.

GENE FUNCTION

Jansa et al. (1998) demonstrated that Ptrf interacts with both TTF1 and
Pol I, and binds to transcripts containing the 3-prime end of pre-rRNA
in vitro. Recombinant Ptrf induced the dissociation of ternary Pol I
transcription complexes in vitro, releasing both Pol I and nascent
transcripts from the template.

By comparative proteomic screening of Cav1-knockout and wildtype mouse
embryonic fibroblasts, Hill et al. (2008) identified Ptrf as a putative
caveolar coat protein. Ptrf associated with mature caveolae in the
plasma membrane, but not with Golgi-localized caveolin. In PC3 human
prostate cancer cells and during development of zebrafish notochord,
lack of PTRF expression correlated with lack of caveolae, and caveolin
redistributed to noncaveolar plasma membrane. Expression of PTRF in PC3
cells was sufficient to cause formation of caveolae. Knockdown of PTRF
reduced caveolae density, both in mammalian cells and in zebrafish.
Caveolin remained on the plasma membrane in PTRF-knockdown cells, but it
exhibited increased lateral mobility and accelerated lysosomal
degradation. Hill et al. (2008) concluded that PTRF is required for
caveola formation and sequestration of mobile caveolin into immobile
caveolae.

Zhu et al. (2011) showed that mouse Mg53 (TRIM72; 613288) and Ptrf
interacted with each other and functioned together in muscle membrane
repair. Ptrf was required for the translocation of Mg53 to the site of
membrane injury in cell culture models and in mice irradiated with a UV
laser to cause localized sarcolemma damage. A mouse mutant ortholog of
the PTRF 525delG mutation (603198.0002) resulted in mislocalization of
Ptrf to the nucleus in transfected human cell lines. Consequently,
mutant Ptrf was unable to target Mg53 to the plasma membrane for repair
of detergent-induced membrane damage. The authors also showed that
cholesterol, which is exposed during membrane damage, was critical for
membrane repair. Cholesterol, bound by Ptrf, functioned as a nucleation
site for the recruitment of Mg53-containing vesicles. Zhu et al. (2011)
hypothesized that, upon cell membrane disruption, PTRF recognizes
exposed cholesterol at the site of injury and tethers MG53 and its
associated intracellular vesicles to the damage site, allowing formation
of a membrane repair patch.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 4 unrelated Japanese patients with congenital generalized
lipodystrophy type 4 (CGL4; 613327) and muscular dystrophy, Hayashi et
al. (2009) identified a homozygous truncating mutation in the PTRF gene
(696insC; 603198.0001). A fifth Japanese patient was compound
heterozygous for the 696insC mutation and another truncating mutation
(525delG; 603198.0002).

In 10 patients from Oman with lipodystrophy, muscular dystrophy, and
cardiac conduction defects, consistent with CGL4 (Rajab et al., 2002),
Rajab et al. (2010) identified a homozygous truncating mutation in the
PTRF gene (160delG; 603198.0003), resulting in complete loss of protein
function. A girl from the U.K. with a similar phenotype was homozygous
for another truncating mutation (362dupT; 603198.0004). Rajab et al.
(2010) noted that the symptoms of the patients combine the features seen
in individuals with mutations in CAV1 (601047), such as CGL3 (612526),
and with those in CAV3 (601253), such as LGMD1C (607801) and rippling
muscle disease (RMD; 606072), since the PTRF gene product in essential
for caveolae biogenesis. PTRF is expressed in many tissues, but highest
mRNA levels are found in adipocytes, smooth muscle, skeletal muscle,
heart, and osteoblasts, consistent with the tissues affected in patients
with CGL4. The nervous system is spared.

In 3 patients, including 2 sibs, with CGL4, Shastry et al. (2010)
identified 2 different homozygous truncating mutations in the PTRF gene
(603198.0005-603198.0006). In addition, the affected sibs reported by
Simha et al. (2008) were found to be compound heterozygous for 2
truncating PTRF mutations (603198.0007 and 603198.0008). Clinical
information available from some of the parents, who carried heterozygous
PTRF mutations, showed some metabolic abnormalities, including increased
serum triglycerides and insulin intolerance, although none had
lipodystrophy.

ANIMAL MODEL

Liu et al. (2008) found that Ptrf-knockout mice were viable and of
normal weight, but had a metabolic phenotype of significantly reduced
adipose tissue mass, higher circulating triglyceride levels, glucose
intolerance, and hyperinsulinemia, consistent with a lipodystrophy.
Cells from various tissues of Ptrf-knockout mice, including lung
epithelium, intestinal smooth muscle, skeletal muscle, and endothelial
cells showed no detectable caveolae cells. These cells also had markedly
decreased expression of all 3 caveolin isoforms, although some tissues
showed increased mRNA, a possible compensatory response. The findings
indicated that cavin is required for the formation and/or stabilization
of morphologically defined caveolae. Liu et al. (2008) suggested that
the absence of cavin impairs the ability of adipocytes to store
triglycerides, which in turn leads an increase in circulating lipids,
glucose intolerance, and insulin resistance.

In 4 unrelated Japanese patients with congenital generalized
lipodystrophy type 4 (CGL4; 613327) and muscular dystrophy, Hayashi et
al. (2009) identified a homozygous 1-bp insertion (696insC) in exon 2 of
the PTRF gene. A fifth Japanese patient was compound heterozygous for
the 696insC mutation and a 1-bp deletion in exon 2 (525delG;
603198.0002). The 696insC mutation substitutes the last 158 amino acids
with an unrelated 191-amino acid sequence, and the 535delG mutation
changes the last 275 amino acids to a 98-amino acid sequence. Neither
mutation was found in 200 control individuals. Haplotype analysis of
696insC carriers suggested that a founder effect may not be likely but
could not be ruled out.

had lack of subcutaneous fat, prominent musculature, exercise

contractions. She also had atlanto-axial instability, osteoporosis,
hepatomegaly with fatty infiltration, and insulin resistance. She died
suddenly at age 13 years from sudden cardiac death to due ventricular

resulting in a frameshift and premature termination. The unaffected

result in a frameshift and premature termination, and a G-to-T
transversion in intron 1, predicted to result in the inclusion of 143

601989	TITLE *601989 S100 CALCIUM-BINDING PROTEIN A13; S100A13
DESCRIPTION Wicki et al. (1996) reported the characterization of a human gene they
symbolized S100A13, a calcium-binding protein belonging to the S100
protein family. S100 proteins are small EF-hand calcium-binding proteins
of variable lengths and sequence identities. At least 12 of 15 members
of the family are clustered on chromosome 1q21 (see S100A1; 176940);
S100A13 likewise colocalizes with S100A1 on the 1q21 cluster. The
predicted 98 amino acid S100A13 protein shows sequence homologies to
other S100 proteins between 50.5% (S100A5; 176991) and 59.3% (S100A12;
603112). Northern blot analysis showed high amounts of S100A13 mRNA in
adult skeletal muscle, heart, kidney, ovary, spleen, small intestine,
and pancreas and in fetal lung, heart, cochlea, liver, spleen, and
parathyroid tumor cells. Moderate levels were detected in all other
tissues examined, with the exception of placenta and leukocytes, which
had very low or undetectable levels. Wicki et al. (1996) also cloned the
mouse S100A13 gene. Mouse S100A13 is composed of 98 amino acids and
displays 86.7% homology compared to human S100A13.

172471	TITLE *172471 PHOSPHORYLASE KINASE, TESTIS/LIVER, GAMMA-2; PHKG2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The PHKG2 gene encodes the hepatic and testis isoform of the gamma
subunit of phosphorylase kinase (PHK; EC 2.7.11.19). The skeletal muscle
isoform of the gamma subunit is encoded by the PHKG1 gene (172470).

CLONING

Whitmore et al. (1994) isolated a clone identified as the PHKG2 gene
from a heteronuclear cDNA library constructed from a mouse/human somatic
cell hybrid that contained chromosome 16. Most of the sequence showed
100% homology with the sequence of an isoform of a catalytic subunit of
phosphorylase kinase (Hanks, 1989).

GENE STRUCTURE

Burwinkel et al. (1998) determined that the PHKG2 gene contains 10 exons
and spans 9.5 kb. The positions of introns were highly conserved between
PHKG2 and PHKG1. The beginning of intron 2 harbors a highly polymorphic
GGT/GT microsatellite repeat.

MAPPING

Whitmore et al. (1994) mapped the PHKG2 gene to chromosome 16p12.1-p11.2
by use of a high-resolution somatic cell panel.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Maichele et al. (1996) reported that autosomal liver-specific PHK
deficiency (glycogen storage disease IXc; GSD9C; 613027) was caused by
mutations in the PHKG2 gene. They found homozygous PHKG2 mutations in 3
patients of consanguineous parentage. One mutation was a single basepair
insertion in codon 89 that caused a frameshift and premature chain
termination (172471.0001). The 3 other mutations resulted in
nonconservative replacements of amino acid residues that are highly
conserved within the catalytic core regions of all protein kinases. The
findings suggested that the PHKG2 gene product is the predominant
isoform of catalytic gamma subunit of PHK not only in testis but also in
liver, erythrocytes, and possibly other nonmuscle tissues.

Burwinkel et al. (1998) identified homozygous translation-terminating
mutations in the PHKG2 gene, R442X (17241.0004) and 277delC
(172471.0005), in 2 patients with liver phosphorylase kinase deficiency
who developed cirrhosis in childhood. As liver phosphorylase kinase
deficiency is generally a benign condition and progression to cirrhosis
is very rare, the findings suggested to the authors that PHKG2 mutations
are particularly associated with an increased cirrhosis risk.

Burwinkel et al. (2000) reported compound heterozygosity for missense
mutations in the PHKG2 gene (172471.0006; 172471.0007) in a child with
phosphorylase kinase deficiency and cirrhosis.

ANIMAL MODEL

Malthus et al. (1980) described deficiency of liver phosphorylase kinase
in rats and concluded that it was an autosomal recessive trait. Apart
from hepatomegaly, the affected rats appear healthy. Clark and Haynes
(1988) described autosomal recessive glycogen storage disease in the rat
(gsd/gsd). Maichele et al. (1996) identified a homozygous mutation in
the rat Phkg2 gene (D215N) as responsible for the gsd phenotype in the
rat.

GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE IXc
PHKG2, 1-BP INS

In a Norwegian girl with autosomal recessive glycogen storage disease
IXc (613027) Sovik et al. (1982), Maichele et al. (1996) identified
homozygosity for a 1-bp insertion in codon 89 of the PHKG2 gene; the
resultant frameshift (after 22% of the normal length of the reading
frame) led to premature termination of the predicted polypeptide after
12 additional amino acids. The parents, who were fourth cousins, and a
sister were unaffected. She proband presented at 5 months of age, and
again at 3 years, with marked hepatomegaly, generalized muscular
hypotonia, growth retardation, elevated serum transaminases, and massive
liver glycogenosis. PHK activity was barely detectable in liver; in a
muscle biopsy, PHK activity was moderately reduced (35% of controls) but
muscle glycogen content was nevertheless low. No liver fibrosis was
observed. She attained a normal height of 172 cm at age 18, and menarche
was at age 17. The relative size of the liver gradually decreased, and
at age 18 serum activities of gamma-glutamyltransferase and alanine
aminotransferase were approaching normal ranges. Serum cholesterol was
normal, hypoglycemic symptoms were not noted, and body weight was
normal.

GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE IXc
PHKG2, GLY189GLU

In a French girl with glycogen storage disease IXc (613027), whose
parents were first cousins, Maichele et al. (1996) identified
homozygosity for a G-to-A transition in the PHKG2 gene that led to a
gly189-to-glu (G189E) substitution. G189 is absolutely conserved between
the testicular and muscle forms of the gamma subunit of several species
and is never occupied by charged amino acids. The patient had been
hospitalized at 7 months of age because of hypoglycemic episodes and
pronounced hepatomegaly. Mild muscle hypotonia and retardation of growth
and motor development were also observed. Notable laboratory findings
were persistent hypoglycemia with acidosis, and elevated triglycerides
and transaminases. Liver histology revealed fine portal fibrosis.

GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE IXc
PHKG2, VAL106GLU

In a Pakistani girl with glycogen storage disease IXc (613027), whose
parents were first cousins, Maichele et al. (1996) demonstrated
homozygosity for a val106-to-glu (V106E) missense mutation in the PHKG2
gene. The girl was admitted at the age of 15 months for investigation of
a distended abdomen due to hepatomegaly with no other clinical symptoms
except growth retardation. However, she had increased serum ALT and
triglycerides, increased liver glycogen, and severe fibrosis and
proliferation of bile ducts on liver biopsy.

GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE IXc
PHKG2, ARG44TER

In a female with liver phosphorylase kinase deficiency and cirrhosis
(GSD9C; 612027), whose parents were consanguineous, Burwinkel et al.
(1998) found point mutations in the PHKG2 gene. One patient had a C-to-T
transition in exon 3, resulting in an arg44-to-ter (R44X) nonsense
mutation. In an earlier biochemical analysis of her family (Kagalwalla
et al., 1995), her father and 2 sibs had PHK activities in the
heterozygous range, whereas her mother had normal PHK activity in
repeated tests, so that a new maternal mutation was suspected in spite
of her parents' consanguinity. However, analysis of the parents' DNA
indicated that both were heterozygous for the nonsense mutation.

GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE IXc
PHKG2, 1-BP DEL, 277C

In a female with deficiency of liver phosphorylase kinase and cirrhosis
(GSD9C; 613027) who had previously been described by Shiomi et al.
(1989), Burwinkel et al. (1998) identified deletion of a cytosine
residue in codon 93 (exon 4) of the PHKG2 gene, leading to a frameshift
after 23% of the coding sequence and termination of translation after 17
additional codons. The patient's parents were consanguineous.

PHKG2, HIS144TYR

In a male child of unrelated English parents with liver phosphorylase
kinase deficiency and cirrhosis (GSD9C; 613027), Burwinkel et al. (2000)
identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the PHKG2 gene: a
C-to-T transition resulting in a his144-to-tyr (H144Y) substitution,
which was inherited from his father, and a T-to-G transversion resulting
in a leu225-to-arg (L225R) substitution (172471.0007), which was
inherited from his mother.

607157	TITLE *607157 SIALIC ACID-BINDING IMMUNOGLOBULIN-LIKE LECTIN 11; SIGLEC11
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SIGLECs are a family of cell surface lectins defined by shared
structural motifs in the first 2 immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains and by
their ability to recognize sialic acids via the first Ig V set domain.

CLONING

By searching a genomic database for sequences homologous to SIGLECs,
Angata et al. (2002) identified SIGLEC11. They cloned the full-length
cDNA from a fetal liver cDNA library. The deduced 686-amino acid protein
contains 5 extracellular Ig-like domains, a single-pass transmembrane
domain, and a cytosolic tail. SIGLEC11 has conserved arginine and
aromatic amino acids at its N terminus and 3 conserved cysteines in the
first and second Ig-like domains. An aromatic amino acid conserved among
all other SIGLECs within beta strand G is replaced by a histidine in
SIGLEC11. RT-PCR readily detected SIGLEC11 in brain, placenta, lung,
liver, and pancreas, but not in heart, skeletal muscle, or kidney. No
SIGLEC11-positive cells were found by flow cytometry of peripheral blood
leukocytes. Immunohistochemical analysis of human tissue sections
revealed expression in Kupffer cells in liver, intestinal lamina propria
macrophages, brain microglia, perifollicular cells of the spleen, and
intense staining of chronically inflamed tissues. SIGLEC11 stably
expressed in a mouse macrophage cell line could be immunoprecipitated as
a 100-kD band under reducing conditions and as a 180-kD band under
nonreducing conditions, suggesting that it exists in the membrane as a
disulfide-linked dimer.

GENE FUNCTION

Using transient transfection in COS-7 cells, Angata et al. (2002)
detected cell-surface expression of SIGLEC11, but unlike other SIGLECs,
SIGLEC11 failed to show sialic acid-dependent binding of human
erythrocytes. Using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with several
sialylated oligosaccharides, they found that SIGLEC11 binds weakly but
with strict specificity to alpha-2-8-linked sialic acids, with a
preference toward shorter oligomers. The maximal binding was
significantly weaker than that observed using other SIGLECs. Point
mutation of a conserved arginine in beta strand F of the V set domain
reduced but did not abolish binding. When purified from transfected
mouse macrophages in the presence of a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor,
SIGLEC11 was found to be tyrosine phosphorylated, and when
phosphorylated, SIGLEC11 could be coimmunoprecipitated with SHP1
(176883) and SHP2 (176876).

Hayakawa et al. (2005) analyzed the approximately 3-kb region of
homology between human SIGLEC11 and the pseudogene SIGLECP16 and showed
that an approximately 2-kb segment designated A/A-prime including the
first 5 exons is 99.3% identical. However, the rest of this region,
designated B/B-prime, has a much lower identity (94.6%). A phylogenetic
tree of B/B-prime from the human and chimpanzee genomes shows the
topology expected from the gene orthology. In contrast, the A/A-prime
tree shows a within-species clustering of human SIGLEC11 and human
SIGLECP16, suggesting a recent gene conversion event. Pairwise genetic
distances calculations suggested that although the presumed gene
duplication event yielding ancestral SIGLEC11 and SIGLECP16 predated the
human-chimpanzee common ancestor, the subsequent gene conversion
occurred only in the human lineage. Both human SIGLEC11 and human
SIGLECP16 are more closely related to chimp SIGLECP16 than to chimp
SIGLEC11, and the genetic distance between human SIGLEC11 and chimp
SIGLECP16 is nearly the same as that between SIGLECP16 orthologs. Thus
human SIGLECP16 converted human SIGLEC11. A search of human
single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) databases suggested that the
SIGLEC11 sequence is universal to modern humans. The converted region
includes a 5-prime upstream region and exons encoding the Sia
recognition domain. Hayakawa et al. (2005) studied the Sia-binding
properties of recombinant, soluble Siglec11 protein. Chimp Siglec11
showed more robust binding than human SIGLEC11, specifically to
N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), the Sia type missing in humans.
Human SIGLEC11 still bound oligosialic acids, which are enriched in the
brain. Human brain cortex microglia showed strong SIGLEC11 staining in 8
individuals. However, despite positive macrophage staining in other
tissues, microglia showed only occasional staining in 5 chimps and none
in 2 orangutans. Thus, Hayakawa et al. (2005) suggested that brain
microglia gained specific and prominent SIGLEC11 expression in the human
lineage, possibly due to changes of regulatory sequences in the 5-prime
upstream region.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Angata et al. (2002) mapped the SIGLEC11
gene to chromosome 19q13.3-q13.4, about 1 Mb upstream of the SIGLEC3
(159590)-related gene cluster. They also identified a SIGLEC11
pseudogene about 8 kb upstream of the SIGLEC11 gene.

605662	TITLE *605662 RAS-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN RAB36; RAB36
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Homozygous deletions at chromosome 22q11.2 are a recurrent cytogenetic
characteristic of malignant rhabdoid tumors (MRTs; 609322), suggesting
the presence of a tumor suppressor gene in this region. Mori et al.
(1999) constructed a deletion map of the relevant part of 22q11.2 from a
panel of 7 MRT cell lines, and isolated a novel gene, designated RAB36,
from the center of the region. RAB36 encodes a deduced 333-amino acid
protein that contains 3 phosphate/magnesium-binding motifs, 3
guanine-binding motifs, a tyrosine kinase phosphorylation site, and a
C-terminal isoprenylation signal. It shares high amino acid sequence
identity with mouse Rab23 (606144) and human RAB13 (602672). Northern
blot analysis revealed 4.0- and 2.2-kb mRNAs in all human tissues
examined. The larger transcript contains a longer 3-prime noncoding
sequence. RT-PCR analysis revealed expression of RAB36 mRNAs in 1 MRT
cell line and overexpression in 2 others. Direct sequencing of cDNA from
these 3 cell lines showed neither nonsense nor frameshift mutations.
Moreover, a colony-formation assay indicated that RAB36 is not concerned
with cell proliferation or cell death. The authors concluded that RAB36
does not have a tumor suppressor function. Immunofluorescence studies
localized RAB36 at the Golgi body, suggesting that RAB36, like some
other Rab family proteins, is involved in vesicular transport around the
Golgi apparatus.

By use of exon trapping and large-scale genomic sequence analysis of 2
BAC clones, Zhou et al. (2000) also isolated RAB36, as well as another
gene, RTDR1 (605663), in the 22q11.2 region. They found no RAB36
mutations in rhabdoid tumor samples.

GENE STRUCTURE

Mori et al. (1999) determined that the RAB36 gene spans approximately 19
kb of genomic DNA and contains 11 exons.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Mori et al. (1999) and Zhou et al. (2000)
identified the RAB36 gene on chromosome 22q11.2.

601437	TITLE *601437 Fc FRAGMENT OF IgG, RECEPTOR TRANSPORTER, ALPHA; FCGRT
;;IMMUNOGLOBULIN RECEPTOR, INTESTINAL, HEAVY CHAIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The intestinal epithelium of neonatal mice and rats expresses an Fc
receptor (FcRn) that mediates the selective uptake of immunoglobulin G
(IgG) in mothers' milk, thereby helping newborn animals to acquire
passive immunity. Kandil et al. (1996) noted that the IgG in the milk is
bound to FcRn at the apical surface of the intestinal epithelium, and
the resultant FcRn-IgG complexes are transcytosed across the epithelium.
At the basolateral surface of intestinal epithelial cells, IgG is
released from FcRn into blood or tissue fluids. FcRn is structurally
similar to the major histocompatibility complex class I molecule, which
presents antigenic peptides to T cells. Like the MHC class I molecule,
FcRn is made up of a heavy chain (approximately 48 kD) and
beta-2-microglobulin (109700; approximately 12 kD). Its heavy chain
shows approximately 35% amino acid sequence identity to that of a
typical MHC class I molecule. Furthermore, the genomic organizations of
the MHC class I and mouse FcRn heavy chain genes are similar in that the
signal peptide, the 3 extracellular domains, the transmembrane region,
and the cytoplasmic region are all encoded by separate exons. Story et
al. (1994) cloned a cDNA encoding the human gene and symbolized it FcRn.
Kandil et al. (1996) isolated human genomic clones for the gene
(symbolized FCGRT by them) using 2 murine Fcgrt probes. The exonic
sequences of the genomic clones are identical to the cDNA sequence
described by Story et al. (1994).

GENE FUNCTION

Plasma protein catabolism occurs in vascular endothelium by endocytotic
processing of plasma contents. Vascular endothelium is the most active
endocytic tissue in the body and the principal site for plasma protein
catabolism. Plasma proteins diffusing or transported into extravascular
sites are isolated from catabolism while extravascular. The receptor
encoded by the FCGRT gene, alternatively called the Brambell receptor,
the protection receptor, or the neonatal receptor, is located in
endosomes of vascular endothelial cells and selectively recycles IgG to
the cell surface, thus protecting IgG from lysosomal catabolism that is
the fate of other, nonprotected plasma proteins. In mice with knockout
of this receptor, the fractional catabolic rate for IgG may be
accelerated up to 10-fold relative to wildtype animals in which
protection is intact (Junghans and Anderson, 1996). This protection
mechanism is directly responsible for making IgG the longest lived of
all plasma proteins (Waldmann and Strober, 1969).

Junghans et al. (2001) postulated that long-range cis inactivation of
the FCGRT gene is responsible for hypercatabolism of IgG in myotonic
dystrophy (DM; 160900). The FCGRT gene is closely situated to the DMPK
gene (605377), which is mutant in DM.

MAPPING

Ahouse et al. (1993) found that the mouse FcRn heavy chain gene,
designated Fcgrt, maps to chromosome 7 and thus is not encoded by the
MHC. Kandil et al. (1996) showed by fluorescence in situ hybridization
that the human gene, FCGRT, maps to 19q13.3. Thus, like its mouse
counterpart, FCGRT is not encoded by the MHC.

ANIMAL MODEL

Akilesh et al. (2004) showed that mice lacking FcRn were resistant to
transient inflammatory arthritis induced in wildtype mice upon transfer
of serum from arthritic K/BxN mice, which are universally susceptible to
autoimmune arthritis due to pathogenic anti-GPI (172400) IgG antibodies.
K/BxN mice deficient in FcRn had significantly delayed onset of
arthritis or only intermittent ankle inflammation without arthritic
disease, and they had low anti-GPI antibody titers without high B-cell
levels in popliteal lymph nodes during the experimental period.
Heterozygote and sick homozygote mice had lymphocytes expressing the
B-cell maturation markes Prdm1 (603423) and Tnfrsf17 (109545), the Th2
cytokines IL1b (147720) and IL10 (124092), the chemokines Scya20 (CCL20;
601960) and Scya3 (CCL3; 182283), and Fcgr1 (146760). Treatment of mice
with high-dose intravenous Ig (IVIg) reduced or eliminated arthritis
dependent on the presence of Fcgr2 (146790) and/or FcRn. Akilesh et al.
(2004) concluded that these findings provide a rational basis for the
use of IVIg and suggested that FcRn is a potential therapeutic target
linking the initiation and effector phases of humoral autoimmune
disease.

In contrast to rodents, in humans FcRn is expressed in adults, in
placenta--where it serves to transport IgG from mother to fetus (Story
et al., 1994)--and in several absorptive epithelial tissues, including
the lung, kidney, and intestine. The expression of FcRn in absorptive
epithelia, coupled with the description by Dickinson et al. (1999) of
FcRn transport of IgG through human intestinal epithelial cells in
vitro, suggested to Bitonti et al. (2004) that FcRn might be exploited
for the delivery of therapeutic proteins by conjugation of the proteins
to an FcRn-binding ligand, such as the Fc fragment of IgG1, which would
allow their transport across the epithelium. Bitonti et al. (2004)
showed that FcRn-mediated transport is functional in the lung of
nonhuman primates and that this transport system can be used to deliver
erythropoietin (EPO; 133170) when it is conjugated to the Fc region of
IgG1. Erythropoietin is a hormone used to stimulate red blood cell
production but requiring chronic therapy with either intravenous or
subcutaneous injection, making an alternative noninvasive method of
delivery desirable. FcRn-dependent absorption was more efficient when
the EPO-Fc fusion protein was deposited predominantly in the upper and
central airways of the lung, where epithelial expression FcRn was most
prominently detected. The bioavailability of an EPO-Fc monomer when
delivered through the lung was approximately equal to that reported for
unconjugated EPO delivered subcutaneously in humans. These studies
showed that FcRn can be harnessed to noninvasively deliver bioactive
proteins into the systemic circulation in therapeutic quantities.

603109	TITLE *603109 MOTHERS AGAINST DECAPENTAPLEGIC, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, 3; SMAD3
;;MADH3;;
SMA- AND MAD-RELATED PROTEIN 3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Drosophila Mad is required for signaling by the TGF-beta (e.g.,
190180)-related factor decapentaplegic. Zhang et al. (1996) cloned a
human cDNA encoding MADH3, a homolog of Drosophila Mad. The deduced
425-amino acid MADH3 protein (GenBank GENBANK 2522267) is 92% identical
to MADH2 (601366).

By searching an expressed sequence tag database with the protein
sequences of Mad and Mad homologs, Riggins et al. (1996) isolated human
cDNAs encoding MADH3, which they called JV15-2. The C terminus of MADH3
shows significant homology to that of Drosophila Mad.

GENE STRUCTURE

Arai et al. (1998) determined the genomic structure of SMAD3, which
contains 9 exons.

MAPPING

Riggins et al. (1996) mapped the MADH3 gene to 15q21-q22 by somatic cell
hybrid analysis and screening of YAC clones.

GENE FUNCTION

Zhang et al. (1996) showed that MADH3 and MADH4 (SMAD4; 600993)
synergized to induce strong ligand-independent TGF-beta-like responses.
MADH3 containing a C-terminal truncation acted as a dominant-negative
inhibitor of the normal TGF-beta response. The activity of MADH3 was
regulated by the TGF-beta receptors (e.g., 190181), and MADH3 was
phosphorylated and associated with the ligand-bound receptor complex.
Zhang et al. (1996) stated that these results define MADH3 as an
effector of the TGF-beta response.

Zawel et al. (1998) found that human SMAD3 and SMAD4 proteins could
specifically recognize an identical 8-bp palindromic sequence
(GTCTAGAC). Tandem repeats of this palindrome conferred striking
TGF-beta responsiveness to a minimal promoter. This responsiveness was
abrogated by targeted deletion of the cellular SMAD4 gene. These results
showed that SMAD proteins are involved in the biologic responses to
TGF-beta and related ligands.

Scleroderma is a chronic systemic disease that leads to fibrosis of the
skin and other affected organs. TGFB has been implicated in the
pathogenesis of scleroderma. SMAD proteins function as signaling
transducers downstream from TGFB receptors. Dong et al. (2002)
investigated the signaling components of the TGFB pathway and TGFB
activity in scleroderma lesions in vivo and in scleroderma fibroblasts
in vitro. Basal level and TGFB-inducible expression of SMAD7 (602932)
were selectively decreased, whereas SMAD3 expression was increased both
in scleroderma skin and in explanted scleroderma fibroblasts in culture.
TGFB signaling events were increased in scleroderma fibroblasts relative
to normal fibroblasts. In vitro adenoviral gene transfer with SMAD7
restored normal TGFB signaling in scleroderma fibroblasts. These results
suggested that alterations in the SMAD pathway, including marked SMAD7
deficiency and SMAD3 upregulation, may be responsible for TGFB
hyperresponsiveness observed in scleroderma.

You and Kruse (2002) studied corneal myofibroblast differentiation and
signal transduction induced by the TGFB family members activin A
(147290) and bone morphogenetic protein-7 (BMP7; 112267). They found
that activin A induced phosphorylation of SMAD2 (601366), and BMP7
induced SMAD1 (601595), both of which were inhibited by follistatin
(136470). Transfection with antisense SMAD2/SMAD3 prevented
activin-induced expression and accumulation of alpha-smooth muscle
actin. The authors concluded that TGFB proteins have different functions
in the cornea. Activin A and TGFB1, but not BMP7, are regulators of
keratocyte differentiation and might play a role during myofibroblast
transdifferentiation. SMAD2/SMAD3 signal transduction appeared to be
important in the regulation of muscle-specific genes.

SMAD3 is a direct mediator of transcriptional activation by the TGF-beta
receptor. Its target genes in epithelial cells include cyclin-dependent
kinase (CDK; see 116953) inhibitors that generate a cytostatic response.
Chen et al. (2002) defined how, in the same context, SMAD3 can mediate
transcriptional repression of the growth-promoting gene MYC (190080). A
complex containing SMAD3, the transcription factors E2F4 (600659), E2F5
(600967), and DP1 (189902), and the corepressor p107 (116957) preexists
in the cytoplasm. In response to TGF-beta, this complex moves into the
nucleus and associates with SMAD4, recognizing a composite SMAD-E2F site
on MYC for repression. Previously known as the ultimate recipients of
CDK regulatory signals, E2F4/E2F5 and p107 act here as transducers of
TGF-beta receptor signals upstream of CDK. SMAD proteins therefore
mediate transcriptional activation or repression depending on their
associated partners.

TGFB (190180) stimulation leads to phosphorylation and activation of
SMAD2 and SMAD3, which form complexes with SMAD4 that accumulate in the
nucleus and regulate transcription of target genes. Inman et al. (2002)
demonstrated that following TGFB stimulation of epithelial cells,
receptors remain active for at least 3 to 4 hours, and continuous
receptor activity is required to maintain active SMADs in the nucleus
and for TGFB-induced transcription. Continuous nucleocytoplasmic
shuttling of the SMADs during active TGFB signaling provides the
mechanism whereby the intracellular transducers of the signal
continuously monitor receptor activity. These data explain how, at all
times, the concentration of active SMADs in the nucleus is directly
dictated by the levels of activated receptors in the cytoplasm.

Based upon molecular allelotyping and comparative genomic hybridization
studies, chromosome 15q is the likely location of a tumor suppressor
gene important in the pathogeneses of sporadic enteropancreatic
endocrine tumors and parathyroid adenomas. To determine whether SMAD3
plays a primary role in the development of these tumors, Shattuck et al.
(2002) investigated 20 enteropancreatic tumors and 67 parathyroid
adenomas for LOH at DNA markers surrounding SMAD3. Twenty percent of
enteropancreatic tumors and 24% of parathyroid adenomas showed loss. All
9 coding exons and intron-exon boundaries of the SMAD3 gene were then
sequenced in genomic DNA from all 20 enteropancreatic and 25 parathyroid
tumors, including every case with LOH. No acquired clonal mutations,
insertions, or microdeletions in SMAD3 were detected in any tumors.
Because inactivating somatic mutation is the hallmark of an authentic
tumor suppressor, SMAD3 is unlikely to function as a classic tumor
suppressor gene in the pathogenesis of sporadic parathyroid or
enteropancreatic endocrine tumors.

Matsuura et al. (2004) showed that SMAD3 is a major physiologic
substrate of the G1 cyclin-dependent kinases CDK4 (123829) and CDK2
(116953). Except for the retinoblastoma protein family, SMAD3 was the
only CDK4 substrate demonstrated to that time. Matsuura et al. (2004)
mapped CDK4 and CDK2 phosphorylation sites to thr8, thr178, and ser212
in SMAD3. Mutation of the CDK phosphorylation sites increased Smad3
transcriptional activity, leading to higher expression of the CDK
inhibitor p15 (600431). Mutation of the CDK phosphorylation sites of
Smad3 also increased its ability to downregulate the expression of
c-myc. Using Smad3 knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts and other
epithelial cell lines, Matsuura et al. (2004) further showed that Smad3
inhibits cell cycle progression from G1 to S phase and that mutation of
the CDK phosphorylation sites in Smad3 increases this ability. They
concluded that CDK phosphorylation of SMAD3 inhibits its transcriptional
activity and antiproliferative function.

To determine the role of SMAD3 in the pathogenesis of lymphoid
neoplasia, Wolfraim et al. (2004) measured SMAD3 mRNA and protein in
leukemia cells obtained at diagnosis from 19 children with acute
leukemia: 10 with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 7 with
pre-B-cell ALL, and 2 with acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL). SMAD3
protein was absent in T-cell ALL but present in pre-B-cell ALL and ANLL.
No mutations in the SMAD3 gene were identified in T-cell ALL, and SMAD3
mRNA was present in T-cell ALL and normal T cells at similar levels.
Wolfraim et al. (2004) concluded that loss of SMAD3 protein is a
specific feature of pediatric T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia.

Gupta et al. (2006) retracted their paper describing the identification
of a microRNA in the latency-associated transcript (Lat) of herpes
simplex virus (HSV)-1 (miR-Lat) that targets TGFB and SMAD3 via
sequences in their 3-prime UTRs that show partial homology to miR-Lat.

In experiments using mouse muscle, Carlson et al. (2008) found that, in
addition to the loss of Notch (190198) activation, old muscle produces
excessive TGF-beta (but not myostatin, 601788), which induces unusually
high levels of Smad3 in resident satellite cells and interferes with the
regenerative capacity. Importantly, endogenous Notch and Smad3
antagonize each other in the control of satellite cell proliferation,
such that activation of Notch blocks the TGF-beta-dependent upregulation
of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors p15, p16 (600160), p21
(116899), and p27 (600778), whereas inhibition of Notch induces them.
Furthermore, in muscle stem cells, Notch activity determined the binding
of Smad3 to the promoters of these negative regulators of cell cycle
progression. Attenuation of TGF-beta/Smad3 in old, injured muscle
restored regeneration to satellite cells in vivo. Thus, a balance
between endogenous Smad3 and active Notch controls the regenerative
competence of muscle stem cells, and deregulation of this balance in the
old muscle microniche interferes with regeneration.

Davis et al. (2008) demonstrated that induction of a contractile
phenotype in human vascular smooth muscle cells by TGF-beta (190180) and
BMPs (see 112264) is mediated by miR21 (611020). miR21 downregulates
PDCD4 (608610), which in turn acts as a negative regulator of smooth
muscle contractile genes. Surprisingly, TGF-beta and BMP signaling
promoted a rapid increase in expression of mature miR21 through a
posttranscriptional step, promoting the processing of primary
transcripts of miR21 (pri-miR21) into precursor miR21 (pre-miR21) by the
Drosha complex (see 608828). TGF-beta and BMP-specific SMAD signal
transducers SMAD1 (601595), SMAD2 (601366), SMAD3, and SMAD5 (603110)
are recruited to pri-miR21 in a complex with the RNA helicase p68 (DDX5;
180630), a component of the Drosha microprocessor complex. The shared
cofactor SMAD4 (600993) is not required for this process. Thus, Davis et
al. (2008) concluded that regulation of microRNA biogenesis by
ligand-specific SMAD proteins is critical for control of the vascular
smooth muscle cell phenotype and potentially for SMAD4-independent
responses mediated by the TGF-beta and BMP signaling pathways.

Chuderland et al. (2008) identified an SPS motif in ERK2 (MAPK1; 176948)
and SMAD3 and a similar TPT motif in MEK1 (MAP2K1; 176872) that directed
protein nuclear accumulation when phosphorylated.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Using cDNA, Roth et al. (2000) conducted mutation analysis of the SMAD2,
SMAD3, and SMAD4 genes in 14 Finnish kindreds with hereditary
nonpolyposis colon cancer (see 120435). They found no mutations.

In a 4-generation Dutch family with arterial aneurysms and dissections
and early-onset osteoarthritis mapping to chromosome 15q22.2-q24.2, van
de Laar et al. (2011) analyzed the candidate gene SMAD3 and identified
heterozygosity for a missense mutation (R287W; 603109.0001) that
segregated with disease. The authors designated the disorder
aneurysms-osteoarthritis syndrome (AOS), but it is here incorporated
into the Loeys-Dietz phenotypic series as Loeys-Dietz syndrome type 3
(LDS3; 613795). Analysis of SMAD3 in 99 patients with thoracic aortic
aneurysms and dissections and Marfan-like features, who were known to be
negative for mutation in the FBN1 (134797), TGFBR1 (190181), and TGFBR2
(190182) genes, revealed 2 additional probands with heterozygous SMAD3
mutations (603109.0002; 603109.0003). All 3 mutations were located in
the MH2 domain, which mediates oligomerization of SMAD3 with SMAD4
(600993) and SMAD-dependent transcriptional activation.

Regalado et al. (2011) reported 4 new mutations in SMAD3. One mutation
(603109.0004) was a frameshift mutation in exon 5 segregating in a
family with LDS3 phenotype. The other 3 were missense mutations in
invariant codons.

Van de Laar et al. (2012) identified 5 novel SMAD3 mutations in 5
additional families with aneurysms-osteoarthritis syndrome (see, e.g.,
603109.0008-603109.0010).

ANIMAL MODEL

Zhu et al. (1998) reported the targeted disruption of the mouse Smad3
gene. Smad3 mutant mice were viable and fertile. Between 4 and 6 months
of age, the Smad3 mutant mice became moribund with colorectal
adenocarcinomas. The neoplasms penetrated through the intestinal wall
and metastasized to lymph nodes. Since TGF-beta transduces its signal to
the interior of the cell via Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4, these results
directly implicate TGF-beta signaling in the pathogenesis of colorectal
cancer and provide a compelling animal model for the study of human
colorectal cancer.

Yang et al. (1999) found that Smad3-null (ex8/ex8) mice died between 1
and 8 months due to a primary defect in immune function. The mice
exhibited inflammatory lesions in a number of organs, including the
nasal mucosa, stomach, pancreas, colon, and small intestine, as well as
enlarged lymph nodes, an involuted thymus, and the formation of
bacterial abscesses adjacent to mucosal surfaces. Immunostaining
revealed a significant increase in T-cell activation, suggesting that
Smad3 has a role in TGFB-mediated regulation of T-cell activation.

Renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis is a chronic inflammatory condition in
which renal fibrosis is associated with epithelial-mesenchymal
transition of the renal tubules and synthesis of extracellular matrix in
response to multiple entities, including ureteral obstruction. TGFB
plays a pivotal role in the disease process. Sato et al. (2003) found
that Smad3-null mice with ureteral obstruction were protected against
tubulointerstitial fibrosis, presumably by blocking the downstream
effects of TGFB. Levels of TGFB mRNA and mature protein were decreased
in the mutant animals compared to experimental controls, indicating that
the Smad3 pathway is also essential for autoinduction of TGFB.

Wolfraim et al. (2004) used mice in which 1 or both alleles of Smad3
were inactivated to evaluate the role of Smad3 in the response of normal
T cells to TGF-beta and in the susceptibility to spontaneous
leukemogenesis in mice in which both alleles of the tumor suppressor
p27(Kip1) (CDKN1B; 600778) were deleted. The loss of 1 allele for Smad3
impaired the inhibitory effect of TGF-beta on the proliferation of
normal T cells and worked in tandem with the homozygous inactivation of
p27(Kip1) to promote T-cell leukemogenesis. Wolfraim et al. (2004)
concluded that a reduction in Smad3 expression and the loss of p27(Kip1)
work synergistically to promote T-cell leukemogenesis in mice.

Ashcroft et al. (1999) generated Smad3-null mice and observed
accelerated cutaneous wound healing, with complete reepithelialization
by day 2 compared to day 5 in wildtype mice, and significantly reduced
local infiltration of monocytes. Smad3 -/- keratinocytes showed altered
patterns of growth and migration, and Smad3 -/- monocytes exhibited a
selectively blunted chemotactic response to TGF-beta (190180).

Arany et al. (2006) created excisional ear wounds in Smad3 -/- mice and
observed wound enlargement compared to wildtype controls. Levels of
elastin and glycosaminoglycans were increased, collagen fibers were more
compactly organized, and integrins, TGFB1, and matrix metalloproteinases
were altered both basally and after wounding in Smad3-knockout mice.
Mechanical testing revealed an increased modulus of elasticity,
suggesting an imbalance of tissue forces. Arany et al. (2006) proposed
that the altered mechanical elastic properties lead to a persistent
retractile force that is opposed by decreased wound contractile forces.

Kanamaru et al. (2005) found that bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs)
from Smad3-null mice had an augmented capacity to produce
proinflammatory cytokines upon stimulation with lipopolysaccharide. Mast
cell-deficient mice reconstituted with Smad3-null BMMCs survived
significantly longer in an acute peritonitis model than mast
cell-deficient mice reconstituted with wildtype BMMCs. Kanamaru et al.
(2005) proposed that SMAD3 in mast cells inhibits mast cell-mediated
immune responses against gram-negative bacteria.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
LOEYS-DIETZ SYNDROME, TYPE 3
SMAD3, ARG287TRP

In 20 affected members of a 4-generation Dutch family with arterial
aneurysms and dissections and early-onset osteoarthritis (LDS3; 613795),
van de Laar et al. (2011) identified heterozygosity for an 859C-T
transition in exon 6 of the SMAD3 gene, resulting in an arg287-to-trp
(R287W) substitution at a highly conserved residue within the MH2
domain. The mutation was not found in 7 unaffected family members or in
544 Dutch control chromosomes. Immunohistochemical analysis of aortic
wall tissue from 2 patients showed increased expression of key proteins
in the TGF-beta (see TGFB1, 190180) pathway.

.0002
LOEYS-DIETZ SYNDROME, TYPE 3
SMAD3, 2-BP DEL, 741AT

In 3 Dutch sibs with arterial aneurysms and dissections and early-onset
osteoarthritis (LDS3; 613795), van de Laar et al. (2011) identified
heterozygosity for a 2-bp deletion (741delAT) in exon 6 of the SMAD3
gene, resulting in a frameshift and a premature termination sequence at
codon 309 in exon 7 that removes nearly the complete MH2 domain
(Thr247ProfsX61). The deletion, which was presumably present in their
affected deceased father, was not found in their unaffected mother or in
544 Dutch control chromosomes. Analysis of patient cDNA showed very weak
mutant signal compared to wildtype, and treatment of patient fibroblast
cultures with cycloheximide markedly increased the mutant signal,
indicating that most of the abnormal RNA was subjected to nonsense
messenger RNA decay and that a truncated SMAD3 protein was barely
formed.

.0003
LOEYS-DIETZ SYNDROME, TYPE 3
SMAD3, THR261ILE

In a Dutch male patient with arterial aneurysm and early-onset
osteoarthritis (LDS3; 613795), van de Laar et al. (2011) identified
heterozygosity for a 783C-T transition in exon 6 of the SMAD3 gene,
resulting in a thr261-to-ile (T261I) substitution at a highly conserved
residue in the MH2 domain. The mutation was not found in 544 Dutch
control chromosomes.

.0004
LOEYS-DIETZ SYNDROME, TYPE 3
SMAD3, 1-BP DEL, 652A

In a 3-generation pedigree segregating autosomal dominant thoracic
aortic aneurysms and dissections with intracranial and other arterial
aneurysms (LDS3; 613795), Regalado et al. (2011) identified a deletion
of an A at nucleotide 652 in exon 5 of the SMAD3 gene, resulting in
frameshift leading to premature termination following asparagine-218
(N218fs). This mutation was present in all individuals with vascular
disease in the family and segregated with a lod score of 2.52. The
pedigree had originally been reported by Regalado et al. (2011). The
mutation was absent from 2,300 control exomes.

.0005
LOEYS-DIETZ SYNDROME, TYPE 3
SMAD3, ARG279LYS

In 2 unrelated families of European descent with autosomal dominant
thoracic aortic and other aneurysms (LDS3; 613795), Regalado et al.
(2011) identified a G-to-A transition at nucleotide 836 in exon 6 of the
SMAD3 gene, resulting in an arg-to-lys substitution at codon 279
(R279K). Arg279 is completely conserved from human to Drosophila, and
the R279K mutation was predicted to disrupt protein function. The
mutation was not identified in 2,300 control exomes. There was decreased
penetrance in younger family members.

.0006
LOEYS-DIETZ SYNDROME, TYPE 3
SMAD3, GLU239LYS

In a small family with 3 sibs affected with thoracic aortic aneurysm and
dissection (LDS3; 613795), Regalado et al. (2011) identified a G-to-A
transition at nucleotide 715 in exon 6 of the SMAD3 gene, resulting in a
glutamine-to-lysine substitution at codon 239 (E239K). Exon 6 encodes
the MH2 protein-protein binding domain. Glu239 is completely conserved
from human to Drosophila, and the E239K mutation was predicted to
disrupt protein function. The mutation was not identified in 2,300
control exomes.

.0007
LOEYS-DIETZ SYNDROME, TYPE 3
SMAD3, ALA112VAL

In a family segregating autosomal dominant thoracic aortic aneurysm with
dissection as well as other features of Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS3;
613795) including bifid uvula and scoliosis, and early-onset
osteoarthritis, Regalado et al. (2011) identified a heterozygous
alanine-to-valine substitution at codon 112 (A112V). The mutation
segregated with disease with reduced penetrance in this family and was
not identified in 2,300 control exomes. Guo (2012) stated that the
correct nucleotide change for the A112V mutation is 335C-T in exon 2
rather than 235C-T as cited in Regalado et al. (2011).

.0008
LOEYS-DIETZ SYNDROME, TYPE 3
SMAD3, 1-BP DEL, 313G

In a patient with aneurysms-osteoarthritis syndrome (LCS3; 613795), van
de Laar et al. (2012) identified a 1-bp deletion at nucleotide 313 of
the SMAD3 gene (313delG), resulting in a frameshift (ala105profsX11).

.0009
LOEYS-DIETZ SYNDROME, TYPE 3
SMAD3, PRO263LEU

In a patient with aneurysms-osteoarthritis syndrome (LCS3; 613795), van
de Laar et al. (2012) identified a 788C-T transition in the SMAD3 gene,
resulting in a pro263-to-leu (P263L) substitution.

.0010
LOEYS-DIETZ SYNDROME, TYPE 3
SMAD3, GLU361TER

In affected members of a family segregating aneurysms-osteoarthritis
syndrome (LCS3; 613795), van de Laar et al. (2012) identified a 1-bp
duplication at nucleotide 1080 in the SMAD3 gene (1080dupT), resulting
in a glu361-to-ter (E361X) substitution.

611529	TITLE *611529 CYTOCHROME P450, FAMILY 2, SUBFAMILY S, POLYPEPTIDE 1; CYP2S1
;;CYTOCHROME P450, SUBFAMILY IIS, POLYPEPTIDE 1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database analysis, followed by RT-PCR of human liver mRNA, Rylander
et al. (2001) cloned CYP2S1. The deduced 504-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 55.8 kD. CYP2S1 contains an N-terminal
hydrophobic stretch, a proline-rich region, and a conserved cysteine
predicted to act as the heme iron ligand. CYP2S1 shares highest sequence
similarity with CYP2B6 (123930), CYP2A6 (122720), and CYP2F1 (124070).
Dot-blot analysis of human tissues detected highest CYP2S1 expression in
trachea, lung, fetal lung, stomach, small intestine, and spleen, with
lower expression in colon, appendix, liver, kidney, thymus, substantia
nigra, peripheral leukocytes, and placenta. Northern blot analysis
detected a 2.4-kb transcript with high expression in lung, small
intestine, and spleen and lower expression in colon, liver, kidney, and
peripheral leukocytes. Sucrose gradient fractionation of human lung
tissue colocalized CYP2S1 with ER marker ERP29 (602287), and
immunofluorescence microscopy confirmed localization of CYP2S1 to the
endoplasmic reticulum.

GENE STRUCTURE

Rylander et al. (2001) determined that the CYP2S1 gene contains 9 exons
spanning more than 13 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Rylander et al. (2001) mapped the CYP2S1
gene to chromosome 19q13.2.

;;FOS-RELATED ANTIGEN 2; FRA2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Matsui et al. (1990) isolated a FRA2 cDNA by screening human cDNA
libraries using FOS (164810) as a probe. The FRA2 open reading frame
encodes a 326-amino acid protein with the leucine zipper domain and
C-terminal region conserved in the FOS family.

GENE FAMILY

The FOS gene family consists of 4 members: FOS, FOSB (164772), FRA1
(136515), and FRA2 (Molven et al., 1996). These genes encode leucine
zipper proteins that can dimerize with proteins of the JUN family (see
165160), thereby forming the transcription factor complex AP-1. As such,
the FOS proteins have been implicated as regulators of cell
proliferation, differentiation, and transformation. In some cases,
expression of the FOS gene has also been associated with apoptotic cell
death.

GENE FUNCTION

Bozec et al. (2008) demonstrated that the FOS-related protein FRA2
controls osteoclast survival and size. They observed that bones of
Fra2-deficient newborn mice had giant osteoclasts, and signaling through
leukemia-inhibitory factor (LIF; 159540) and its receptor (LIFR; 151443)
was impaired. Similarly, newborn animals lacking Lif had giant
osteoclasts, and Bozec et al. (2008) demonstrated that LIF is a direct
transcriptional target of FRA2 and c-JUN (604641). Moreover, bones
deficient in Fra2 and Lif were hypoxic and expressed increased levels of
hypoxia-induced factor 1-alpha (HIF1A; 603348) and Bcl2 (151430).
Overexpression of Bcl2 was sufficient to induce giant osteoclasts in
vivo, whereas Fra2 and Lif affected Hif1a through transcriptional
modulation of the Hif prolyl hydroxylase Phd2 (606425). This pathway is
operative in the placenta, because specific inactivation of Fra2 in the
embryo alone did not cause hypoxia or the giant osteoclast phenotype.
Bozec et al. (2008) concluded that thus, placenta-induced hypoxia during
embryogenesis leads to the formation of giant osteoclasts in young pups.

MAPPING

Molven et al. (1996) assigned FRA2 to chromosome 2p23-p22 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization.
