190170	TITLE *190170 TRANSFORMING GROWTH FACTOR, ALPHA; TGFA
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Transforming growth factors (TGFs) are biologically active polypeptides
that reversibly confer the transformed phenotype on cultured cells.
TGF-alpha shows about 40% sequence homology with epidermal growth factor
(EGF; 131530) and competes with EGF for binding to the EGF receptor
(131550), stimulating its phosphorylation and producing a mitogenic
response.

GENE STRUCTURE

Collin et al. (1999) determined the exon-intron structure of the TGFA
gene and excluded it as a candidate for Alstrom syndrome (203800).

MAPPING

Brissenden et al. (1985) used a human genomic DNA clone to map the TGFA
locus to chromosome 2p13-2p11 in somatic cell hybrids with confirmation
by in situ hybridization. They commented on the possible significance of
the fact that in Burkitt lymphoma with 2;8 translocation, the breakpoint
is at chromosome 2p13-p11. Thus, t(2;8) might place TGFA near the MYC
oncogene. Tricoli et al. (1985, 1986) likewise assigned TGFA to
chromosome chromosome 2p13 by in situ hybridization. Fowler et al.
(1993) demonstrated that the murine Tgfa gene is linked to Igkc
(147200), Fabp1 (134650), and Ly-2 (CD8A; 186910) on chromosome 6.

GENE FUNCTION

Ellis et al. (1987) presented evidence that TGFA plays a role in certain
paraneoplastic manifestations of melanoma: the sign of Leser-Trelat (the
sudden appearance of, or increase in the number and size of, seborrheic
keratoses), acanthosis nigricans, and eruptive acrochordons (sudden
onset of multiple skin tags).

Fernandez-Larrea et al. (1999) used the 2-hybrid screen to identify
pro-TGF-alpha cytoplasmic domain-binding proteins, which they referred
to as TACIPs (pro-TGF-alpha cytoplasmic domain-interacting proteins),
involved in the trafficking of pro-TGF-alpha. They cloned 2 such
proteins, which they designated TACIP1 (601017) and TACIP18 (602217).

The circadian clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus is thought to drive
daily rhythms of behavior by secreting factors that act locally within
the hypothalamus. In a systematic screen, Kramer et al. (2001)
identified TGFA as a likely suprachiasmatic nucleus inhibitor of
locomotion. TGFA is expressed rhythmically in the suprachiasmatic
nucleus, and when infused into the third ventricle it reversibly
inhibited locomotor activity and disrupted circadian sleep-wake cycles.
These actions were mediated by EGF receptors on neurons in the
hypothalamic subparaventricular zone. Mice with a hypomorphic EGF
receptor mutation exhibited excessive daytime locomotor activity and
failed to suppress activity when exposed to light. Kramer et al. (2001)
concluded that their results implicate EGF receptor signaling in the
daily control of locomotor activity. They identified a neural circuit in
the hypothalamus that likely mediates the regulation of behavior both by
the suprachiasmatic nucleus and the retina using TGFA and EGF receptors
in the retinohypothalamic tract.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

orofacial clefting, see OFC2 (602966).

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

O'Dowd et al. (1997) isolated 4 novel human putative G protein-coupled
receptor (GPCR) genes: GPR20 (601908), GPR21 (601909), GPR22, and GPR23
(LPAR4; 300086). All 4 contain the 7 putative transmembrane regions
characteristic of GPCRs. Their deduced proteins share significant
sequence identity to each other and to other members of the GPCR family.
Northern blot analysis revealed expression of GPR22 and GPR20 in several
human brain regions.

MAPPING

O'Dowd et al. (1997) mapped the GPR22 gene to chromosome 7q22-q31.1 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization.

614854	TITLE *614854 LEUCINE-RICH REPEAT-CONTAINING PROTEIN 59; LRRC59
;;p34
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By mass spectrometric analysis and peptide sequencing of proteins from
human U2OS cells that bound to immobilized acidic FGF (aFGF, or FGF1;
131220), Skjerpen et al. (2002) identified LRRC59, which they called
p34. They cloned the cDNA by RT-PCR of a U2OS cDNA library. The deduced
307-amino acid protein has an N-terminal domain, followed by 4 repeats
of a conserved 23-amino acid leucine-rich sequence, a coiled-coil
domain, a transmembrane domain, and a short C-terminal tail. Northern
blot analysis detected abundant expression of a 3.8-kb transcript in all
human tissues examined, with highest expression in placenta, followed by
skeletal muscle, colon, kidney, liver, and lung. Transcripts of 1.4 and
1.0 kb were also observed. Database analysis revealed orthologs of p34
in mouse, rat, fruit fly, and nematode. Crosslinking experiments
followed by SDS-PAGE revealed that p34 existed as a monomer but could
form dimers.

Zhen et al. (2012) stated that the C-terminal tail of human LRRC59 is
predicted to localize to the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).
Confocal microscopy confirmed that LRRC59 localized to the ER and also
detected LRRC59 at the nuclear envelope.

GENE FUNCTION

Using truncation analysis, Skjerpen et al. (2002) found that the the
coiled-coil domain of p34 bound aFGF. The interaction between p34 and
aFGF appeared to have a 1:1 ratio, and p34 did not bind a nonmitogenic
aFGF(K132E) mutant. CK2 (see CSNK2A1; 115440) competed with p34 for
binding to aFGF. p34 also bound basic FGF (FGF2; 134920), but more
weakly.

Zhen et al. (2012) stated that FGF1 is imported into the nucleus, where
it has growth regulatory activity. Nuclear FGF1 is phosphorylated by
protein kinase C-delta (PRKCD; 176977), signaling FGF1 export from the
nucleus for its cytosolic degradation. Using small interfering RNA
directed against LRRC59, Zhen et al. (2012) found that LRRC59 was
required for nuclear uptake and nuclear phosphorylation of exogenously
added FGF1 in BJ human fibroblasts. Knockdown of LRRC59 did not alter
FGF1 endocytic uptake or cytoplasmic accumulation. LRRC59 had no effect
on nuclear import of protein kinase C-delta, suggesting that it is not a
general nuclear import factor. Zhen et al. (2012) noted that LRRC34 was
originally believed to be a ribosome receptor, but that this function
has been rejected.

MAPPING

Hartz (2012) mapped the LRRC59 gene to chromosome 17q21.33 based on an
alignment of the LRRC59 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF119857) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

605781	TITLE *605781 RAS HOMOLOG GENE FAMILY, MEMBER D; RHOD
;;ARHD;;
RHO-RELATED PROTEIN HP1; RHOHP1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ARHD belongs to the Ras (190020) homolog, or Rho, gene family. Rho
proteins interact with protein kinases and may serve as targets of
activated GTPase. Rho family proteins play a critical role in muscle
differentiation by regulating the expression of myogenin (159980) and
MEF2 (see 600660) genes.

CLONING

By sequence analysis of placental cDNAs, Shimizu et al. (1997)
identified a cDNA encoding ARHD, which they termed RHOHP1. The deduced
210-amino acid protein is approximately 50% identical to other Rho
proteins and contains 4 conserved guanine nucleotide-binding stretches.
Northern blot analysis revealed expression of a 1.2-kb transcript in
heart, placenta, liver, skeletal muscle, and pancreas, with low levels
in several other tissues; this pattern was somewhat distinct from that
of other Rho family members.

GENE FUNCTION

Gasman et al. (2003) demonstrated that the DIA2C splice variant of
DIAPH2 (300108) interacted with ARHD both in vivo and in vitro and that
ARHD recruited cytosolic DIA2C onto early endosomes.
Coimmunoprecipitation of cotransfected HeLa cells indicated that DIA2C
interacted with ARHD in the GTP-bound form. The interaction induced the
alignment of early endosomes along actin filaments and reduced their
motility. In the absence of ARHD, deletion of the DIA2C GTPase-binding
domain led to DIA2C localization to endosomes and blocked about 85% of
endosomes in a nonmotile state. Coexpression of DIA2C and ARHD in HeLa
cells stimulated SRC kinase (CSK; 124095) activity, which was required
to alter endosome motility. Gasman et al. (2003) concluded that DIA2C
and SRC (190090) are sequentially activated by ARHD to regulate the
motility of early endosomes through interaction with the actin
cytoskeleton.

MAPPING

Kim et al. (2000) mapped the RHOD gene to 11q14.3 by radiation hybrid
analysis.

601281	TITLE *601281 SEMAPHORIN 3B; SEMA3B
;;SEMAPHORIN A; SEMAA;;
SEMAPHORIN V; SEMA5
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The semaphorin/collapsin family of molecules plays a critical role in
the guidance of growth cones during neuronal development. See
semaphorin-3F (601124).

CLONING

In the process of constructing a complete cosmid/P1 contig covering this
region for the positional cloning of oncogenes, Sekido et al. (1996)
identified 2 additional members of the human semaphorin family,
semaphorin-3B, which they called semaphorin A(V), and semaphorin-3F,
which they called semaphorin IV, in chromosome region 3p21.3. The 2
genes have widespread but distinct patterns of expression in nonneural
tissues, and have different patterns of expression in lung cancer. Human
semaphorin A(V) has 86% amino acid homology with murine semaphorin A,
whereas semaphorin IV is more closely related to murine semaphorin E,
with 50% homology. Sekido et al. (1996) showed that human semaphorin
A(V) is translated in vitro into a 90-kD protein that accumulates in the
endoplasmic reticulum. Human semaphorin A(V) was expressed in only 1 out
of 23 small cell lung cancers (SCLCs) and 7 out of 16 non-SCLCs, whereas
semaphorin IV was expressed in 19 out of 23 SCLCs and 13 out of 16
non-SCLCs. Mutational analysis of semaphorin A(V) revealed mutations
(germline in 1 case) in 3 of 40 lung cancers.

Using Northern blot analysis, Lerman and Minna (2000) detected wide
expression of a 3.4-kb SEMA3B transcript that was strongest in placenta,
weaker in other tissues, including lung and testis, and not detectable
in small cell lung cancer cell lines. Missense mutations were found in
nonsmall cell lung cancer cell lines. The authors stated that SEMA3B is
likely to be an extracellular secreted protein. Lerman and Minna (2000)
concluded that SEMA3B is an attractive candidate for methylation and
functional tumor suppressor gene analyses.

GENE FUNCTION

The short arm of chromosome 3 exhibits high loss of heterozygosity (LOH)
in several types of cancer, including ovarian, kidney, lung, and
testicular. In particular, overlapping homozygous deletions in lung
cancers have been identified in region 3p21.3; more than 90% of small
cell lung cancers (182280) exhibit LOH at this site. To examine the
question of whether the SEMA3B gene, which resides on 3p21.3, may be a
tumor suppressor gene, Tse et al. (2002) analyzed the effects of SEMA3B
on HEY cells, an ovarian cancer cell line. They found that HEY cells
expressing SEMA3B diminished tumorigenicity in nude mice. SEMA3B also
markedly reduced the anchorage independence of HEY cells.

Gong et al. (2003) described a large-scale screen to create an atlas of
CNS gene expression at the cellular level, and to provide a library of
verified bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) vectors and transgenic
mouse lines that offer experimental access to CNS regions, cell classes,
and pathways. They demonstrated that Sema3b is involved in axon-target
interactions. Sema3b can act to repulse axons expressing neuropilin-2
(NPN2; 602070) and can antagonize the repulsive action of Sema3a
(603961) on axonal growth cones expressing neuropilin-1 (602069).
Visualization of the expression of the enhanced green fluorescent
protein (EGFP) reporter in Sema3b BAC transgenic mice predicted an
important role for Sema3b in the formation of the circuitry of the
olfactory system. In embryonic day 15.5 embryos, Sema3b expression in
the developing olfactory system was widespread. Intense expression was
also present in the developing vomeronasal organ.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Lerman and Minna (2000) determined that
the SEMA3B gene contains 17 exons and spans 8 to 10 kb.

MAPPING

Sekido et al. (1996) mapped the SEMA3B and SEMA3F genes to chromosome
3p21.3. The 2 genes lie within approximately 70 kb of each other. SEMA3B
and SEMA3F are flanked by 2 GTP-binding protein genes, GNAI2 (139360)
and GNAT1 (139330). Sekido et al. (1996) stated that other human
semaphorin gene sequences, for example, human semaphorin III (SEMA3A;
603961) and homologs of murine semaphorins B (SEMA4A) and C (SEMA4B),
are not located on chromosome 3.

604163	TITLE *604163 RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN L3; RPL3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

RPL3 is an essential and indispensable component for formation of the
ribosomal peptidyltransferase center. It has a role in aminoacyl-tRNA
binding, peptidyltransferase activity, drug resistance, translational
frame maintenance, and virus replication. RPL3 also acts as a binding
site for a ribosome inhibitory protein (Meskauskas and Dinman, 2007).

CLONING

Adams et al. (1992) isolated the 3-prime region of an RPL3 cDNA as a
human brain EST. The complete coding sequence of the human RPL3 gene has
been deposited in GenBank (GENBANK X73460). The deduced RPL3 protein has
403 amino acids.

Cuccurese et al. (2005) identified an RPL3 splice variant in a human
lung carcinoma cell line that was induced by pharmacologic blockade of
the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway. This splice variant retains
the 3-prime-most 180 nucleotides of intron 3, resulting in an in-frame
premature termination codon. Northern blot analysis showed that the
variant transcript is 1.5 kb, while the major RPL3 transcript is 1.3 kb.
Intron 3 is highly conserved in human, mouse, and bovine RPL3.

GENE FUNCTION

Cuccurese et al. (2005) blocked nonsense-mediated mRNA decay using
cycloheximide and wortmannin and observed pronounced accumulation of the
1.5-kb RPL3 splice variant, but no change in the level of the major RPL3
transcript. The level of the 1.5-kb transcript progressively decreased
following drug withdrawal. RPL3 protein overexpression resulted in
accumulation of the alternative transcript in a dose-dependent manner.
Cuccurese et al. (2005) concluded that the RPL3 protein regulates
alternative splicing of the RPL3 gene.

Meskauskas and Dinman (2007) stated that RPL3 has 2 long tentacle-like
structures that extend deep into the mostly rRNA core of the ribosome.
The central extension, called the 'W finger,' reaches all the way to the
A-site side of the peptidyltransferase center. Meskauskas and Dinman
(2007) used targeted mutagenesis and structural, biochemical, and
genetic approaches to examine the W finger of S. cerevisiae Rpl3. The
findings suggested a model in which RPL3 plays a role in synchronizing
aminoacyl-tRNA accommodation and translocation by functioning as a
sensor of tRNA occupancy at the A site of the peptidyltransferase
center.

GENE STRUCTURE

Duga et al. (2000) determined that the RPL3 gene contains 10 exons and
spans about 6.7 kb. Introns 1, 3, 5, and 7 of the RPL3 gene encode the
C/D box small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) U43 (SNORD43; 611068), U86
(611069), U83A (SNORD83A; 611070), and U83B (SNORD83B; 611071),
respectively. Intron 4 harbors a 283-bp Alu-SP-like repeat.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid and radiation hybrid mapping analyses, Kenmochi
et al. (1998) mapped the human RPL3 gene to 22q.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Duga et al. (2000) identified a polymorphic 19-bp deletion within intron
6 of the RPL3 gene that showed an allelic frequency of about 3% in a
Northern Italian population.

611921	TITLE *611921 GAP JUNCTION PROTEIN, BETA-7; GJB7
;;CONNEXIN 25; CX25
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Connexins, such as GJB7, are involved in the formation of gap junctions,
intercellular conduits that directly connect the cytoplasms of
contacting cells. Each gap junction channel is formed by docking of 2
hemichannels, each of which contains 6 connexin subunits (Sohl et al.,
2003).

CLONING

By database analysis and PCR of human genomic DNA, Sohl et al. (2003)
cloned GJB7, which they called CX25. Northern blot analysis detected
weak expression of a 2.7-kb CX25 transcript in placenta only. Sohl et
al. (2003) stated that there is no ortholog of CX25 in mouse.

MAPPING

138322	TITLE *138322 GLUTATHIONE PEROXIDASE 4; GPX4
;;PHOSPHOLIPID HYDROPEROXIDE GLUTATHIONE PEROXIDASE; PHGPX
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

GPX4 reduces phospholipid hydroperoxides within membranes and
lipoproteins and acts in conjunction with alpha-tocopherol to inhibit
lipid peroxidation. Lipid peroxidation is implicated in a number of
pathophysiologic processes, including inflammation and atherogenesis.
GPX4 is a selenoprotein whose production and activity are sensitive to
selenium (Se), which is incorporated into selenoproteins as
selenocysteine (summary by Sneddon et al., 2003).

CLONING

Using porcine Phgpx to screen a testis cDNA library, Esworthy et al.
(1994) cloned human GPX4, which they called PHGPX. The 3-prime UTR
contains a selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) required for
insertion of selenocysteine at an opal codon (UGA). The deduced
197-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 19 kD. It has
putative active-site tryptophan and glutamic acid residues that are
predicted to interact with selenocysteine, and a tyrosine residue that
is phosphorylated in the porcine protein.

By fractionation and immunofluorescence microscopy of resting human
platelets, Januel et al. (2006) showed that GPX4 associated with
membranes, cytoplasm, and mitochondria, and that GPX4 activity showed an
identical distribution. Western blot analysis detected GPX4 at an
apparent molecular mass of 20 to 21 kD.

Roveri et al. (1992) found that rat Gpx4 was present primarily in
testis. Januel et al. (2006) stated that rat has mitochondrial and
nonmitochondrial forms of Gpx4.

Borchert et al. (2003) characterized the expression of 2 major isoforms
of Gpx4 in mouse tissues. One isoform, which they designated the
phospholipid (phGpx) form, was expressed in many tissues. The other,
designated the sperm nucleus (snGpx) isoform, was detected in mouse
testis and kidney, as well as in a human embryonic kidney cell line.
Subcellular fractionation and immunoelectron microscopy revealed
cytosolic localization. Immunohistochemical staining of mouse kidneys
showed staining for snGpx in cortical and medullary interstitial cells.
Analysis of the 5-prime flanking region common to both isoforms revealed
strong promoter activity. The snGpx4 promoter, which contains 334 bp of
intronic sequence, suppressed the activity of the common promoter.

GENE FUNCTION

In human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), Sneddon et al.
(2003) observed a dose-dependent increase in GPX4 mRNA and protein
levels with increasing Se concentration until the Se concentration
reached 76 nM. GPX4 enzyme activity was optimum at an even higher Se
concentration. Sneddon et al. (2003) noted that these findings
contrasted with findings in other tissues and cell types, suggesting
that Se regulates GPX4 in a tissue- and cell-type specific manner,
possibly reflecting the relative importance of GPX4 in individual
tissues. They also found that, in addition to Se, fatty acids,
cytokines, and redox state regulated GPX4 expression and activity, but
sometimes in different and opposing ways.

Activation of platelets by agonists such as thrombin (F2; 176930) leads
to a dramatic increase in cell surface expression of several receptors,
as well as changes in platelet shape, release of arachidonic acid from
phospholipids, and increased level of peroxides. Using fractionated
human platelets and confocal immunofluorescence microscopy, Januel et
al. (2006) found that GPX4 protein and enzymatic activity redistributed
from the cytosol to membranes following platelet activation. They
hypothesized that mobilization of GPX4 toward membranes protects
platelets against the burst of lipid hydroperoxides and limits the stage
of activation.

By yeast 3-hybrid screening of a mouse testis cDNA library, followed by
RNA mobility gel shift assays, Ufer et al. (2008) found that the
RNA-binding protein Grsf1 (604851) bound an AGGGGA motif in the 5-prime
UTR of mitochondrial Gpx4. Grsf1 upregulated Gpx4 UTR-dependent reporter
gene expression, recruited mitochondrial Gpx4 mRNA to translationally
active polysomes, and coimmunoprecipitated with Gpx4 mRNA. During
embryonic mouse brain development, Grsf1 and mitochondrial Gpx4 were
coexpressed, and knockdown of Grsf1 via small interfering RNA prevented
embryonic Gpx4 expression. Compared with mock controls, Grsf1-knockdown
embryos showed developmental retardation that paralleled increased
apoptosis and massive lipid peroxidation. Overexpression of
mitochondrial Gpx4 prevented the apoptotic changes and rescued
development in Grsf1-knockdown embryos. Ufer et al. (2008) concluded
that GRSF1 upregulates translation of GPX4 mRNA and that both proteins
are required for embryonic brain development.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

To overcome inefficient selenocysteine-incorporating machinery in
recombinant systems, Scheerer et al. (2007) expressed recombinant human
cytosolic GPX4 containing a sec46-to-cys (U46C) mutation, which retains
residual catalytic activity, in E. coli. They solved the crystal
structure of this molecule to 1.55-angstrom resolution. X-ray data
indicated that the monomeric protein consisted of 4 alpha helices and 7
beta strands. The catalytic triad (cys46, gln81, and trp136) localized
at a flat impression on the protein surface extending into a
surface-exposed patch of basic amino acids (lys48, lys135, and arg152)
that also contained polar thr139. Mutation analysis confirmed the
functional importance of the catalytic triad. Like the wildtype enzyme,
the U46C mutant exhibited a strong tendency toward polymerization, which
was prevented by reductants. Site-directed mutagenesis suggested
involvement of the catalytic cys46 and surface-exposed cys10 and cys66
in polymer formation. In GPX4 crystals, these residues contacted
adjacent protein monomers.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kelner and Montoya (1998) determined that the human GPX4 gene spans 2.8
kb and contains 7 exons. Analysis of the gene sequence identified a
potential alternative tissue-specific first exon.

MAPPING

By Southern analysis of genomic DNA from human/hamster somatic cell
hybrids, Chu (1994) showed that the GPX4 gene is located on chromosome
19. By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Kelner and Montoya (1998)
assigned the gene to chromosome 19p13.3.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Villette et al. (2002) examined the 3-prime UTR of the GPX4 gene in 66
healthy Scottish volunteers and identified a T-C SNP at position 718,
near the predicted SECIS element. The distribution of this SNP was in
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, with 34% CC homozygotes, 25% TT homozygotes,
and 41% TC heterozygotes. Individuals of different genotypes exhibited
significant differences in the levels of lymphocyte 5-lipoxygenase total
products, with CC homozygotes showing 36% and 44% more products than TT
homozygotes and TC heterozygotes, respectively. Villette et al. (2002)
concluded that GPX4 has a regulatory role in leukotriene biosynthesis
and that the 718T-C SNP has functional effects.

ANIMAL MODEL

Ran et al. (2004) stated that Gpx4 deletion in mice is embryonic lethal,
and that embryonic fibroblasts from Gpx4 +/- mice exhibit increased
lipid peroxidation, more cell death after exposure to oxidizing agents,
and growth retardation under high oxygen levels. They found that
expression of human GPX4 rescued the lethal phenotype of Gpx4 -/- mice.
Transgenic mice overexpressing human GPX4 showed reduced oxidative
injury after oxidative stress.

603110	TITLE *603110 MOTHERS AGAINST DECAPENTAPLEGIC, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, 5; SMAD5
;;MADH5;;
SMA- AND MAD-RELATED PROTEIN 5
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Drosophila Mad transduces signals from TGF-beta (e.g., 190180) family
members. By searching an expressed sequence tag (EST) database with the
protein sequences of Mad and Mad homologs, Riggins et al. (1996)
isolated partial human cDNAs encoding MADH5, which they called JV5-1.
The deduced MADH5 protein has 465 amino acids, with 57 of the C-terminal
59 residues identical to those of Mad.

Gemma et al. (1998) determined the full-length cDNA sequence of human
MADH5, which they called SMAD5. Using PCR-SSCP analysis to investigate
the frequency of SMAD5 somatic mutations in human cancers, Gemma et al.
(1998) did not detect either homozygous deletions or point mutations in
40 primary gastric tumors or 51 cell lines derived from diverse types of
cancer, including 20 cell lines resistant to the growth inhibitory
effects of TGF-beta. The SMAD5 protein has strong homology with SMAD1
(601595), SMAD2 (601366), SMAD3 (603109), and SMAD4 (600993) in the N-
and C-terminal domains, which are separated by a proline-rich sequence;
SMAD5 shows the greatest homology to SMAD1.

GENE FUNCTION

Bruno et al. (1998) showed that SMAD5 plays a critical role in the
signaling pathway by which TGF-beta inhibits the proliferation of human
hematopoietic progenitor cells.

Davis et al. (2008) demonstrated that induction of a contractile
phenotype in human vascular smooth muscle cells by TGF-beta and bone
morphogenetic proteins (BMPs; see 112264) is mediated by miR21 (611020).
miR21 downregulates PDCD4 (608610), which in turn acts as a negative
regulator of smooth muscle contractile genes. TGF-beta and BMP signaling
promoted a rapid increase in expression of mature miR21 through a
posttranscriptional step, promoting the processing of primary
transcripts of miR21 (pri-miR21) into precursor miR21 (pre-miR21) by the
Drosha complex (see 608828). TGF-beta and BMP-specific SMAD signal
transducers SMAD1, SMAD2, SMAD3, and SMAD5 (603110) are recruited to
pri-miR21 in a complex with the RNA helicase p68 (DDX5; 180630), a
component of the Drosha microprocessor complex. The shared cofactor
SMAD4 (600993) is not required for this process. Thus, Davis et al.
(2008) concluded that regulation of microRNA biogenesis by
ligand-specific SMAD proteins is critical for control of the vascular
smooth muscle cell phenotype and potentially for SMAD4-independent
responses mediated by the TGF-beta and BMP signaling pathways.

GENE STRUCTURE

By comparison of the SMAD5 cDNA sequence with the SMAD5 genomic
sequence, obtained from YAC clones, Gemma et al. (1998) showed that the
SMAD5 gene has 8 exons, with the coding sequence contained in exons 3 to
8. By 5-prime RACE, the authors identified a SMAD5 cDNA derived from an
alternatively spliced transcript that lacks the 75-bp exon 2.

MAPPING

Riggins et al. (1996) mapped the MADH5 gene to 5q31 by somatic cell
hybrid analysis and screening of YAC clones.

613974	TITLE *613974 DEAD BOX POLYPEPTIDE 60; DDX60
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

DDX60 is a type I interferon (e.g., IFNA1; 147660)-stimulated gene (ISG)
that encodes a protein that has activity against hepatitis C virus (HCV;
see 609532) (Schoggins et al., 2011).

CLONING

By RT-PCR of HeLa cell total RNA, Miyashita et al. (2011) cloned
full-length DDX60. The deduced 1,712-amino acid protein contains an RNA
helicase domain spanning amino acids 760 to 1330 that consists of a
DEXD/H box motif and a C-terminal RNA helicase motif. Northern blot
analysis detected variable expression of a 5.5-kb transcript in all
human tissues examined. Confocal microscopy localized epitope-tagged
DDX60 in the cytoplasm of transfected HeLa cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Using an overexpression screening approach to test more than 380 ISGs,
including DDX60, for their ability to inhibit replication of various
human and animal viruses, including HCV, yellow fever virus, West Nile
virus (see 610379), chikungunya virus, Venezuelan equine encephalitis
virus, and human immunodeficiency virus-1 (see 609423), Schoggins et al.
(2011) found that DDX60 had activity against HCV.

Using microarray analysis, Miyashita et al. (2011) found that viral
infection upregulated RIGI (DDX58; 609631)-like receptors (RLRs) and
Ddx60 in mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic cells. In human cell lines,
DDX60 coprecipitated with the antiviral RNA exosome components EXOSC1
(606493) and EXOSC4 (606491). DDX60 also associated with RIGI and the
RLRs MDA5 (IFIH1; 606951) and LGP2 (DHX58; 608588). In HEK293 cells,
endogenous RIGI bound DDX60 after vesicular stomatitis virus infection,
but not in its absence. Knockdown analysis of human cells showed that
DDX60 was required for RIGI- and MDA5-dependent type I interferon and
interferon-inducible gene expression in response to viral infection. The
antiviral activity of DDX60 was independent of the RNA exosome. The
isolated RNA helicase domain of DDX60 (amino acids 752 to 1337) bound
single-stranded RNA, double-stranded RNA, and double-stranded DNA in
vitro. Miyashita et al. (2011) concluded that DDX60 is an antiviral
helicase that promotes RIGI-like receptor-mediated signaling.

MAPPING

Gross (2011) mapped the DDX60 gene to chromosome 4q32.3 based on an
alignment of the DDX60 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC038115) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

600424	TITLE *600424 SOLUTE CARRIER FAMILY 19 (FOLATE TRANSPORTER), MEMBER 1; SLC19A1
;;FOLATE TRANSPORTER; FOLT;;
REDUCED FOLATE CARRIER 1; RFC1;;
INTESTINAL FOLATE CARRIER 1; IFC1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Transport of folate compounds into mammalian cells can occur via
receptor-mediated (see 136430) or carrier-mediated mechanisms. A
functional coordination between these 2 mechanisms has been proposed to
be the method of folate uptake in certain cell types. Methotrexate (MTX)
is an antifolate chemotherapeutic agent that is actively transported by
the carrier-mediated uptake system. RFC1 plays a role in maintaining
intracellular concentrations of folate.

CLONING

Several groups independently cloned cDNAs encoding the 591-amino acid
human folate transporter. Using a mouse reduced folate carrier (RFC)
partial cDNA as a probe, Wong et al. (1995) cloned a human RFC cDNA from
a library prepared from MTX transport-upregulated erythroleukemia cells.
Using homologous murine cDNAs as probes, Williams and Flintoff (1995),
Prasad et al. (1995), and Nguyen et al. (1997) independently isolated
human folate transporter cDNAs from lymphoblast, placenta, and small
intestine libraries, respectively.

Prasad et al. (1995) reported that the human folate transporter, which
they symbolized FOLT, had 65% amino acid sequence identity to mouse and
hamster folate transporters. When transfected into COS-1 and HeLa cells,
the human FOLT cDNA caused a significant increase in the uptake of
5-methyltetrahydrofolate. By Northern blot analysis, mRNA transcripts
hybridizing to the human FOLT cDNA were detected in placenta and liver
and also in several cell lines of human origin. The principal transcript
was approximately 2.7 kb.

Williams and Flintoff (1995) and Wong et al. (1995) observed that human
folate transport cDNAs expressed in MTX transport-deficient Chinese
hamster ovary cells restored MTX transport and sensitivity.

Nguyen et al. (1997) injected human intestinal folate carrier-1 (IFC1)
cRNA into Xenopus oocytes and observed increased uptake of
methyltetrahydrofolic acid. Northern blot analysis revealed that the
IFC1 gene was expressed as a 3.3-kb mRNA at a high level in placenta and
at lower levels in a variety of other tissues, including the small
intestine. In situ hybridization of thin sections of intestinal
epithelia demonstrated IFC1 expression localized to the villus and crypt
cells, particularly the upper half of the villi.

GENE FUNCTION

In luminal epithelial cells isolated from mouse small intestine, Chiao
et al. (1997) found increased PH-dependent folate influx associated with
RFC1 gene expression in the form of a 2.5-kb transcript and a 58-kD
brush border membrane protein detected by folate-based affinity labeling
and with antibodies against the transporter. The authors concluded that
RFC1 mediates intestinal folate transport.

GENE STRUCTURE

Point mutations in the reduced folate carrier-1 gene and alterations
resulting in the downregulation of its message are major factors in the
resistance to antifolate chemotherapeutic agents. As a framework for
understanding the significance of such changes in relation to gene
expression and function, Williams and Flintoff (1998) described the
organization of the RFC1 gene from human lymphoblasts. They found that
the gene contains 5 exons (2 to 6) coding for protein. At least 4
5-prime exons, used in a mutually exclusive manner in the production of
RFC1 message from lymphoblast cells, are spliced to exon 2, which
contains the translational start site. Semiquantitative PCR indicated
that exon 1 is preferentially used. The major transcriptional start site
was mapped by RACE and RNase protection to a region 109 to 135 bp
5-prime to the start of exon 1.

MAPPING

Yang-Feng et al. (1995) used the human folate transporter cDNA and a
human genomic clone hybridizing to the cDNA to perform chromosomal
mapping of the FOLT gene. Human/rodent somatic cell hybrid analysis
using the cDNA as the probe demonstrated perfect segregation with
chromosome 21. Isotopic in situ hybridization with the cDNA probe mapped
the gene to 21q22.3. Fluorescence in situ hybridization using the
genomic clone confirmed this chromosomal localization.

GENETIC VARIABILITY

Tolner et al. (1998) identified 3 splice variants of RFC1, incorporating
3 alternatives of exon 1 and 5 additional exons. By functional deletion
analysis, they identified 2 TATA-less promoters that show substantial
differences in the efficiency with which they drive transcription.
L1210/D3 mouse leukemia cells are resistant to
5,10-dideazatetrahydrofolate due to expansion of cellular folate pools
which block polyglutamation of the drug. These cells were found to have
2 point mutations in the RFC, resulting in the replacement of
isoleucine-48 by phenylalanine (I48F) and of tryptophan-105 by glycine
(W105G). Each mutation contributes to the resistance phenotype. Genomic
DNA from resistant cells contained both the wildtype and mutant alleles,
but wildtype message was not detected. Folic acid was a much better
substrate, and 5-formyltetrahydrofolate was a poorer substrate, for
transport in L1210/D3 cells relative to L1210 cells. Enhanced transport
of folic acid was due to a marked, approximately 20-fold, decrease in
the influx K(m). Influx of methotrexate and 5,10-dideazatetrahydrofolate
were minimally altered. Tse et al. (1998) concluded that the I48F and
W105G mutations in RFC caused resistance to
5,10-dideazatetrahydrofolate, that the region of the RFC protein near
these 2 positions defines the substrate-binding site, that the wildtype
allele was silenced during the multistep development of resistance, and
that this mutant phenotype represents a genetically dominant trait.

Using data from a California population-based case-control interview
study, Shaw et al. (2002) investigated whether spina bifida risk was
influenced by an interaction between a polymorphism of infant RFC1 at
nucleotide 80 (A80G) and maternal periconceptional use of vitamins
containing folic acid. Although the study did not find an increased
spina bifida risk for infants who were heterozygous or homozygous for
RFC1 A80G, it did reveal modest evidence for a gene-nutrient interaction
between infant homozygosity for the G80/G80 genotype and maternal
periconceptional intake of vitamins containing folic acid on the risk of
spina bifida.

604999	TITLE *604999 SH3 AND MULTIPLE ANKYRIN REPEAT DOMAINS 1; SHANK1
;;SOMATOSTATIN RECEPTOR-INTERACTING PROTEIN; SSTRIP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The somatostatin receptor (SSTR) family is widely expressed in neuronal
tissue and modulates synaptic responses by interacting with inhibitory G
proteins in presynaptic as well as postsynaptic compartments of neurons.
Many neurotransmitter receptors are anchored at their respective
specific sites of action by specialized anchoring proteins, which may
link receptors to components of the synaptic structure or the
cytoskeleton. Using the yeast 2-hybrid system to screen for proteins
intracellularly associated with the C terminus of rat Sstr2 (182452),
Zitzer et al. (1999) identified a partial human cDNA encoding SSTRIP.
They screened human brain cDNA libraries and isolated cDNAs representing
several full-length SSTRIP splice variants. The longest predicted form
of SSTRIP consists of 2,182 amino acids. This isoform contains 6
N-terminal ankyrin repeats followed by SH3 and PDZ domains, 7
proline-rich regions, and a C-terminal sterile alpha motif (SAM), which
has been implicated as a dimerization motif. Another SSTRIP isoform
lacked the 6 ankyrin repeats and the SH3 domain. Sequence comparisons
suggested that SSTRIP, together with cortactin (164765)-binding protein
(603290), form a family of cytoskeletal-anchoring proteins.
Fractionation of rat brain membranes indicated that Sstrip is enriched
in the postsynaptic density (PSD) fraction. Northern blot analysis of
various human tissues detected 9- and 7.5-kb SSTRIP transcripts in the
amygdala, hippocampus, substantia nigra, and thalamus. Only the 7.5-kb
transcript was found in organs other than brain, such as heart, skeletal
muscle, kidney, and liver. In situ hybridization of rat brain sections
revealed a striking overlap in the expression patterns of Sstr2 and
Sstrip, including in all layers of the cortex and in the hippocampus.
Both proteins are also prominently expressed in the medial habenula.
However, in the hippocampus, Sstrip mRNA was detected not only in cell
bodies but also in the molecular layer, suggesting that Sstrip mRNA may
be transported into neuronal dendrites.

Lim et al. (1999) identified 4 alternative splice sites in rat Shank1
and other Shank family members, some of which result in deletion of
specific domains in the Shank protein. The expression of Shank splice
variants showed differential regulation in various regions of rat brain
during development. Immunoblot analysis of rat brain revealed
heterogeneity in size and spatiotemporal expression of the Shank
isoforms. Shank1 immunoreactivity was concentrated at excitatory
synaptic sites in adult brain, and punctate Shank1 staining was seen in
developing rat brains by postnatal day 7. Lim et al. (1999) concluded
that alternative splicing of Shank family members may regulate the
molecular structure and the spectrum of Shank-interacting proteins in
PSDs of adult and developing brain.

GENE FUNCTION

Using overlay assays and coimmunoprecipitation experiments, Zitzer et
al. (1999) verified that SSTR2 interacts with SSTRIP.

Naisbitt et al. (1999) determined that the PDZ domain of rat Shank
mediates binding to the C terminus of GKAP (605445) and that this
interaction is important for the synaptic localization of Shank in
neurons. In addition, they showed that the SAM domain is responsible for
multimerization of Shank and that the proline-rich region contains a
specific binding site for cortactin, an actin crosslinking protein
involved in the regulation of the cortical actin cytoskeleton. Naisbitt
et al. (1999) hypothesized that Shank may function as a scaffold protein
in the PSD and potentially crosslink NMDA receptor (see 138249)/PSD95
(602887) complexes and couple them to regulators of the actin
cytoskeleton.

Tu et al. (1999) identified a Homer (see HOMER1; 604798)-binding domain
in rat Shank. Shank and Homer coimmunoprecipitated from rat brain and
colocalized at PSDs. Shank also clustered mGluR5 (138245) in
heterologous cells in the presence of Homer and mediated the
coclustering of Homer with PSD95/GKAP. Tu et al. (1999) concluded that
Shank may crosslink Homer and PSD95 complexes in the PSD and mediate
mGluR and NMDA receptor signaling.

Using rat Homer1b, human HOMER3A (604800), and rat Shank, Hayashi et al.
(2009) showed that Homer and Shank formed a mesh-like matrix structure.

MAPPING

Hartz (2005) mapped the SHANK1 gene to chromosome 19q13.33 based on an
alignment of the SHANK1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF163302) with the
genomic sequence.

CYTOGENETICS

Sato et al. (2012) provided evidence that disruption of the SHANK1 gene
may contribute to the development of autism spectrum disorder (see,
e.g., ASD, 209850) in males. Microarray analysis of 1,158 unrelated
Canadian patients with autism spectrum disorder identified 1 male
patient with a heterozygous 63.8-kb deletion eliminating exons 1 to 20
of the SHANK1 gene and the neighboring gene CLEC11A (604713). The
mutation was found to segregate with high-functioning autism, including
Asperger syndrome (see 608638), in 2 additional males of this family.
Two females without autism also carried the deletion, although both
women were shy and had anxiety. Whole-exome sequencing of 2 affected
males with the deletion identified a truncating mutation (tyr313 to ter)
in the PCDHGA11 gene (606298) that segregated with the SHANK1 deletion
and may have contributed to the phenotype. In a separate microarray
analysis, 1 of 456 European individuals with ASD was found to carry a de
novo heterozygous 63.4-kb deletion affecting the last 3 exons of SHANK1
and the entire neighboring SYT3 gene (600327); deletion of SYT3 may have
contributed to the phenotype in this patient. This patient had a
maternal half-sister with autism who did not carry the deletion. The
deletions in the first family and in the second patient did not overlap.
No deletions affecting the SHANK1 gene were identified in 15,122
controls individuals. Sato et al. (2012) noted that haploinsufficiency
of the SHANK2 (603290) and SHANK3 (606230) genes have been implicated in
autism, and suggested that SHANK1 deletions may also contribute to the
phenotype in males, with reduced penetrance in female carriers.

ANIMAL MODEL

Wohr et al. (2011) observed that Shank1-null mice had low levels of
ultrasonic vocalizations and scent marks compared to wildtype mice.
Shank1-null pups emitted fewer vocalizations when isolated from their
mothers and littermates, and adult Shank1-null mice deposited fewer
scent marks in proximity to females compared to controls. In addition,
wildtype mice changed their calling pattern dependent on previous female
interactions, while Shank1-null mice were unaffected, indicating a
failure of Shank1-null males to learn from a social experience. Wohr et
al. (2011) suggested that these abnormal behaviors were consistent with
a phenotype relevant to social communication deficits in autism.

300794	TITLE *300794 CANCER/TESTIS ANTIGEN FAMILY 45, MEMBER A3; CT45A3
;;CANCER/TESTIS ANTIGEN 45, MEMBER 3; CT45.3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching for genes upregulated in testis, followed by RT-PCR and
genomic sequence analysis, Chen et al. (2005) identified 6 nearly
identical copies of the CT45 gene, designated CT45A1 through CT45A6, on
chromosome X. The CT45 genes appeared to be products of a recent gene
duplication. RT-PCR and EST analysis revealed 3 CT45 transcript variants
that differ in their 3-prime ends and represent the accumulated
expression of the CT45 genes. All 3 transcripts encode a deduced
189-amino acid protein that shares significant similarity with DDX26B,
SAGE (300359), and DDX26 (604331). RT-PCR detected high CT45 expression
in testis and variable expression in several cell lines.

GENE STRUCTURE

Chen et al. (2005) determined that each CT45 gene contains 5 exons and
spans 8 to 9 kb. The first exon is untranslated.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Chen et al. (2005) mapped the CT45 gene
cluster to a 125-kb region on chromosome Xq26.3. The 3 centromeric genes
are transcribed in the centromeric-to-telomeric direction, and the 3
telomeric genes are transcribed in the opposite direction.

186940	TITLE *186940 CD4 ANTIGEN; CD4
;;T-CELL ANTIGEN T4/LEU3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CD4 is a cell surface glycoprotein that is expressed on subsets of
thymocytes and mature T lymphocytes, as well as on monocytes and
macrophages. CD4 plays an important role in T-helper (Th) cell
development and activation (summary by Zeitlmann et al., 2001).

CLONING

In a study of the structure and expression of human and mouse T4 genes,
Maddon et al. (1987) found that T4 RNA is expressed not only in T
lymphocytes, but also in B cells, macrophages, and granulocytes. It is
also expressed in a developmentally regulated manner in specific regions
of the brain. The authors suggested the possibility, therefore, that T4
plays a more general role in mediating cell recognition events than
merely those of cellular immune response. Since the T4 molecule serves
as a receptor for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV; see 609423),
this information may have relevance in relation to the manifestations of
AIDS.

GENE STRUCTURE

Littman (1987) reviewed CD4 gene structure.

Ansari-Lari et al. (1996) generated the genomic sequence of the human
CD4 gene and its neighboring region on chromosome 12p13 using the
large-scale shotgun sequencing strategy. A total of 117 kb of genomic
sequence and approximately 11 kb of cDNA sequence was obtained. They
identified in this sequence 6 genes with known functions, including CD4.
Using a battery of strategies, the exon/intron boundaries, splice
variants, and tissue expression patterns of the genes were determined.

MAPPING

With in situ hybridization, Isobe et al. (1986) regionalized the CD4
gene to chromosome 12pter-p12. By genomic sequence analysis, Ansari-Lari
et al. (1996) mapped the CD4 gene to chromosome 12p13.

Gross (2011) mapped the CD4 gene to chromosome 12p13.31 based on an
alignment of the CD4 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BT019791) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

GENE FUNCTION

CD4 binds to relatively invariant sites on class II major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules outside the peptide-binding
groove, which interacts with the T-cell receptor (TCR). CD4 enhances
T-cell sensitivity to antigen and binds to LCK (153390), which
phosphorylates CD3-zeta (CD3Z; 186780). Instead of clustering in a cap
at the interface with an antigen-presenting cell (APC), some signaling
molecules involved in T-cell recognition segregate into distinct areas
to form a SMAC (supramolecular activation cluster), contributing to the
immunologic synapse (see Grakoui et al. (1999)). Using T-cell lines
transfected with green fluorescent protein-fused CD4 or CD3Z and
3-dimensional video microscopy, Krummel et al. (2000) showed that in
response to peptide-loaded APC, CD3Z and CD4 initially cluster in the
contact area between the T cell and APC coincident with intracellular
calcium mobilization. Stable immunologic synapse formation was modulated
by peptide concentration and compromised by blocking the calcium
increase or cytoskeletal rearrangement. The authors determined that CD3Z
remains at the center of the interface while CD4 moves to the periphery.
Blocking with anti-TCR prevented CD3Z accumulation and inhibited calcium
mobilization. The data suggested that instead of stabilizing TCR-MHC
complexes, CD4 functions to initiate or augment the early phase of
T-cell activation.

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Zeitlmann et al. (2001) found that the
cytoplasmic tail of CD4 interacted with ACP33 (608181). Using
coimmunoprecipitation experiments, they confirmed that endogenous CD4
interacted with ACP33 in an ACP33-transfected CD4-positive T-cell line.
By analyzing the interaction between various truncation and point
mutants, they determined that the last 2 conserved hydrophobic amino
acids at the C terminus of CD4 and ser109 within the alpha/beta fold of
ACP33 were required for the interaction. Truncation of the last 2 amino
acids of CD4 enhanced T-cell receptor (see 186880)-induced T-cell
activation, suggesting that ACP33 is a negative regulator of CD4
activity. The CD4-ACP33 complex could also coprecipitate LCK. There was
no direct interaction between ACP33 and LCK, indicating that ACP33 and
LCK interact independently and simultaneously with CD4.

Although CD4 was identified initially as the cellular receptor for HIV,
several lines of evidence indicated that expression of CD4 alone was
insufficient to confer susceptibility to infection by the virus.
Specifically, HIV did not infect mouse cells transfected with a human
CD4 expression vector or mice transgenic for the expression of human
CD4. Furthermore, although HIV binding and internalization can be
mediated by CD4 acting together with one of several members of the
chemokine receptor superfamily, CCR5 (601373) appears to be the critical
coreceptor used by HIV in the initial stages of infection. However,
because mouse CCR5 differs significantly from human CCR5, it cannot
function as a coreceptor for HIV, and thus, expression of human CD4
alone is insufficient to permit entry of HIV into mouse cells. Browning
et al. (1997) found that mice transgenic for both CD4 and CCR5 are
susceptible to HIV infection.

In transgenic mice carrying the human CD4 gene, Buttini et al. (1998)
found that human CD4 is expressed on microglia, the resident mononuclear
phagocytes of brain. Normally there is no neuronal damage. Activation of
brain microglia by peripheral immune challenges elicited
neurodegeneration in human CD4 mice but not in nontransgenic controls.
In postmortem brain tissues from AIDS patients with opportunistic
infections, but without typical HIV encephalitis, human CD4 expression
correlated with neurodegeneration. Buttini et al. (1998) concluded that
human CD4 may function as an important mediator of indirect neuronal
damage in infectious and immune-mediated diseases of the central nervous
system (CNS). The important role of human CD4 expression on
microglia/macrophages creates a pathogenetic link between the immune
system and the CNS.

The Nef protein of primate lentiviruses downregulates the cell surface
expression of CD4 through a 2-step process. First, Nef connects the
cytoplasmic tail of CD4 with adaptor protein complexes (AP), thereby
inducing the formation of CD4-specific clathrin-coated pits that rapidly
endocytose the viral receptor. Second, Nef targets internalized CD4
molecules for degradation. Piguet et al. (1999) showed that Nef
accomplishes this second task by acting as a connector between CD4 and
the beta subunit of the coatomer protein complex (COPB; 600959) in
endosomes. A sequence encompassing a critical acidic dipeptide, located
nearby but distinct from the AP-binding determinant of HIV-1 Nef, is
responsible for COPB recruitment and for routing to lysosomes. A novel
class of endosomal sorting motif, based on acidic residues, was thus
revealed, and COPB was identified as its downstream partner.

Using immunofluorescence microscopy, Yeaman et al. (2004) examined
expression of the HIV receptors CD4 and galactosylceramide (see GALC;
606890) and the HIV coreceptors CXCR4 (162643) and CCR5 in ectocervical
specimens from hysterectomy patients with benign diseases. CD4
expression was detected on epithelial cells at early and
midproliferative stages of the menstrual cycle, whereas
galactosylceramide expression was uniform in all stages of the menstrual
cycle. CXCR4 was not detected on ectocervical epithelial cells, whereas
CCR5 was expressed on ectocervical epithelial cells at all stages of the
menstrual cycle. CD4-positive leukocytes were present in the basal and
precornified layers of squamous epithelium during early and
midproliferative phases of the menstrual cycle, but were absent in later
proliferative phases and the secretory phase; the presence of
CD4-positive leukocytes was not related to inflammation. Yeaman et al.
(2004) concluded that HIV infection of the ectocervix most likely occurs
through galactosylceramide and CCR5.

Using 3-dimensional fluorescence microscopy, Irvine et al. (2002) showed
that labeled mouse class II complexes containing even a single agonist
peptide on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) are sufficient to evoke
CD4-mediated transient calcium signaling by T cells. Only about 10
agonists are required for the contact zone between a T cell and an APC
to form a CD4-dependent immunologic synapse.

Ben-Sasson et al. (2009) reported that Il1-alpha (IL1A; 147760) and
Il1-beta (IL1B; 147720), but not other proinflammatory cytokines,
markedly induced robust and durable primary and secondary Cd4 responses
in mice, with an increase in cells producing Il17 (603149) and Il4
(147780), as well as serum IgG1 and IgE.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Zhou et al. (2007) constructed stabilized HIV-1 gp120 molecules
constrained to stay in the CD4-bound conformation, even in the absence
of CD4, and determined the crystal structure of gp120 in complex with
the neutralizing IgG1 antibody b12 at 2.3-angstrom resolution. Their
analyses revealed the functionally conserved surface that allows for
initial CD4 attachment and delineated the b12 epitope at the atomic
level. Zhou et al. (2007) proposed that the b12 epitope serves as a key
target for humoral neutralization of HIV-1 in long-term nonprogressors.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- OKT4 Epitope Deficiency

The OKT4 epitope of the CD4 protein is polymorphic in various
populations. In African American, Caucasian, and Japanese individuals
with OKT4 epitope deficiency (613949), Hodge et al. (1991) identified a
C-to-T change at nucleotide 868 of the CD4 gene, resulting in an
arg240-to-trp (R240W; 186940.0001) substitution. Independently, Lederman
et al. (1991) and Takenaka et al. (1993) identified the R240W
substitution as the cause of OKT4 epitope deficiency.

EVOLUTION

Tishkoff et al. (1996) reported linkage disequilibrium at the CD4 locus
on the basis of their studies in 42 geographically dispersed
populations. An Alu deletion polymorphism is associated with a short
tandem repeat polymorphism (STRP) in non-African and North-East African
populations. The Alu deletion is associated with a wide range of STRP
alleles in Sub-Saharan African populations. On the basis of this finding
the authors proposed a common and recent origin for all non-African
human populations. The STRP polymorphism described by Tishkoff et al.
(1996) consisted of a pentanucleotide sequence repeated between 4 and 15
times. The Alu deletion polymorphism that they described resulted from a
256-bp deletion of a 285-bp Alu element.

ANIMAL MODEL

Sawada et al. (1994) and Siu et al. (1994) identified a silencer element
in the first intron of the mouse CD4 gene that is sufficient to repress
CD4 transcription in cells of the CD8 (186910) lineage, as well as in
thymocytes at earlier stages of differentiation. Using mice in which the
CD4 silencer can be conditionally deleted, Zou et al. (2001) showed that
the functional element is required only at distinct stages of
development. If deleted before the initiation of lineage specification,
CD4 is derepressed and, therefore, expressed at stages where thymocytes
are normally double-negative (CD4-/CD8-). In mutant mice, there are no
CD8 single-positive cells in the thymus. Mature thymocytes express
either CD4 alone or both CD4 and CD8. Trichostatin A (TSA), an inhibitor
of deacetylation, was not able to reactivate the silenced CD4 locus,
suggesting that at least TSA-sensitive histone deacetylases (see HDAC3,
605166) are not involved in maintaining CD4 silencing. Zou et al. (2001)
concluded that the CD4 silencer is essential for converting a
transcriptionally active CD4 locus into a heritably silenced state. The
silencer must be maintained in newly committed CD8+ thymocytes to
generate an epigenetically silent CD4 locus in mature daughter cells.

Sun and Bevan (2003) found that mice lacking Cd4 mounted a primary Cd8
response equal to that of wildtype mice and rapidly cleared infection
with Listeria monocytogenes. However, the Cd4-deficient mice had
defective memory Cd8-positive T cells over time, indicating a need for
Cd4 help in promoting protective Cd8 memory development. Sun and Bevan
(2003) proposed that vaccination schemes targeting only CD8 immunity may
fail to provide long-term protection.

Shedlock and Shen (2003) showed that memory Cd8 cells generated in the
presence of Cd4 cells responded normally in Cd4 -/- mice, whereas Cd8
cells induced in Cd4 -/- mice were defective in their recall responses
to both lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus and L. monocytogenes antigens
in Cd4 +/+ mice. They concluded that CD4-positive cells are required in
the priming phase for functional CD8 memory, but they are dispensable
during the recall response for secondary expansion.

In a mouse model of hindlimb ischemia, Stabile et al. (2003)
demonstrated that Cd4 -/- mice had reduced collateral flow induction,
macrophage number, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF; 192240)
levels in the ischemic muscle, with delayed recovery of hindlimb
function and increased muscle atrophy and fibrosis, compared to wildtype
mice. Spleen-derived purified Cd4+ T cells infused into Cd4 -/- mice
selectively localized to the ischemic limb and significantly increased
collateral flow as well as macrophage number and VEGF levels in the
ischemic muscle, with improvement in muscle function and damage. Stabile
et al. (2003) suggested that CD4+ T cells control the arteriogenic
response to acute hindlimb ischemia, at least in part, by recruiting
macrophages to the site of active collateral artery formation, which in
turn triggers the development of collaterals through the synthesis of
arteriogenic cytokines.

NOMENCLATURE

CD4 is the official designation for T-cell antigen T4/leu3, consistent
with the recommendation of the Committee on Human Leukocyte
Differentiation Antigens (1984). CD stands for 'cluster of
differentiation'; the number that follows is arbitrarily assigned. In
the full designation the cell type and nature and molecular weight of
the antigen are given in brackets; for CD4, this is as follows:
[T,gp55].

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
OKT4 EPITOPE DEFICIENCY
CD4, ARG240TRP

In African American, Caucasian, and Japanese individuals with OKT4
epitope deficiency (613949), Hodge et al. (1991) identified a C-to-T
change at nucleotide 868 of the CD4 gene, resulting in an arg240-to-trp
(R240W) substitution.

Independently, Lederman et al. (1991) identified a G-to-A change at
nucleotide 867 of the CD4 gene, resulting in an R240W substitution, in
an individual homozygous for OKT4 epitope deficiency. Expression of a
CD4 cDNA containing this SNP confirmed that the R240W substitution
ablated binding of the OKT4 monoclonal antibody. Lederman et al. (1991)
noted that a positively charged amino acid at this position is found in
chimpanzee, rhesus macaque, mouse, and rat, suggesting that the R240W
change may confer unique functional properties to the OKT4-negative CD4
protein.

Takenaka et al. (1993) identified the R240W substitution in 4
individuals with OKT4 epitope deficiency from a large Japanese family.
Analysis showed different hydrophobicity at positions 239 and 240 of
OKT-negative CD4 from control, probably giving rise to a conformational
change that accounted for the lack of reactivity with OKT4.

607764	TITLE *607764 3-@BETA-HYDROXY-DELTA-5-C27-STEROID OXIDOREDUCTASE; HSD3B7
;;C27-3-BETA-HSD
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Schwarz et al. (2000) used expression cloning to isolate cDNAs encoding
a microsomal 3-beta-hydroxy-delta-5-C27-steroid oxidoreductase that is
expressed predominantly in the liver. The predicted product showed 34%
sequence identity with the C19 and C21 3-beta-HSD enzymes, which
participate in steroid hormone metabolism. Schwarz et al. (2000)
observed that, when transfected into cultured cells, the enzyme encoded
by the C27 3-beta-HSD cDNA was active against four 7-alpha-hydroxylated
sterols, indicating that a single C27 3-beta-HSD enzyme can participate
in all pathways of bile acid synthesis known to that time. The expressed
enzyme did not metabolize several different C19/21 steroids as
substrates. The levels of hepatic C27 3-beta-HSD mRNA in the mouse were
not sexually dimorphic and did not change in response to dietary
cholesterol or to changes in bile acid pool size. The human C27
3-beta-HSD gene encodes a protein of 369 amino acids that is about 86%
identical to the mouse protein.

MAPPING

Schwarz et al. (2000) mapped the human HSD3B7 gene to chromosome
16p12-p11.2 by analysis of radiation hybrid panels.

GENE STRUCTURE

Schwarz et al. (2000) determined that the HSD3B7 gene contains 6 exons
and spans 3 kb of DNA.

GENE FUNCTION

Schwarz et al. (2000) observed that the C27 3-beta-HSD enzymes are
active only against 7-alpha hydroxylated sterol substrates. Human C27
3-beta-HSD enzymes were active against the 7-alpha hydroxylated forms of
24-hydroxycholesterol, 25-hydroxycholesterol, and 27-hydroxycholesterol
and showed no preference for any of those compounds. Northern blot
analysis identified a single 2.4-kb species present at high levels in
liver, pancreas, and kidney, and at lower levels in heart, skeletal
muscle, and placenta.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Schwarz et al. (2000) identified a 2-bp deletion in the C27 3-beta-HSD
gene (607764.0001) in a patient with a congenital defect in bile acid
synthesis (CBAS1; 607765) and neonatal cholestasis.

Cheng et al. (2003) performed a molecular analysis of 15 additional
patients from 13 kindreds with C27 3-beta-HSD deficiency deficiency and
identified 12 different mutations in the HSD3B7 gene (see, e.g.,
607764.0001-607764.0005). They studied 10 mutations in detail; these
were shown to cause complete loss of enzyme activity and, in 2 cases,
alterations in the size or amount of the transcribed RNA. Mutations were
homozygous in 13 patients from 10 families and heterozygous in 4
patients from 3 families. Cheng et al. (2003) concluded that a diverse
spectrum of HSD3B7 mutations underlies this rare form of neonatal
cholestasis.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
BILE ACID SYNTHESIS DEFECT, CONGENITAL, 1
HSD3B7, 2-BP DEL, NT1057

In a Saudi Arabian boy with neonatal progressive intrahepatic
cholestasis (607765), the fifth child of consanguineous parents in the
family originally described by Clayton et al. (1987), Schwarz et al.
(2000) identified a 2-bp deletion in exon 6 of the HSD3B7 gene. This
mutation was found in homozygosity and was not present in 25 healthy
controls. It was predicted to shift the translational reading frame,
causing premature termination and the removal of 23 amino acids from the
carboxy terminus of the protein. In vitro studies showed that the
protein carrying the 2-bp deletion prevented the production of enzyme
capable of isomerizing and oxidizing the 7-alpha-hydroxylated forms of
24-hydroxycholesterol, 25-hydroxycholesterol, and 27-hydroxycholesterol.

Cheng et al. (2003) confirmed this mutation in the family of Clayton et
al. (1987) and found it in a second consanguineous Saudi family. They
determined that the 1057deltaCT mutation gives rise to a protein in
which the first 346 amino acids of the normal protein are fused to a
5-residue extension. The mutation was found to produce mRNAs that were
similar in size and amount to those derived from the normal gene but
failed to encode an active enzyme when introduced into HEK293 cells. It
was not known whether inactivation resulted from elimination of the
normal C-terminal sequences or addition of the spurious residues.

.0002
BILE ACID SYNTHESIS DEFECT, CONGENITAL, 1
HSD3B7, 1-BP INS, 310C

In a Chilean family with neonatal cholestasis caused by C27 3-beta-HSD
deficiency (607765), Cheng et al. (2003) found a deletion of a C
nucleotide at position 310 in exon 1 of the HSD3B7 gene.

.0003
BILE ACID SYNTHESIS DEFECT, CONGENITAL, 1
HSD3B7, IVS2, 340G-T, +1

In a French family with neonatal cholestasis caused by C27 3-beta-HSD
deficiency (607765), Cheng et al. (2003) found a splice junction
mutation in intron 2 of the HSD3B7 gene, 340+1G-T.

.0004
BILE ACID SYNTHESIS DEFECT, CONGENITAL, 1
HSD3B7, GLU147LYS

In 2 French families with neonatal cholestasis caused by C27 3-beta-HSD
deficiency (607765), Cheng et al. (2003) found a missense mutation in
HSD3B7, glu147 to lys (E147K). The amino acid substitution resulted from
a G-to-A transition in exon 4. Although an apparently stable mRNA of
normal abundance was transcribed from the mutant gene, no enzyme
activity was detected in transfected cells. Glutamate-147 is conserved
among all members of the 3-beta-HSD enzyme family in human, mouse, and
rat.

.0005
BILE ACID SYNTHESIS DEFECT, CONGENITAL, 1
HSD3B7, 2-BP DEL, 63AG

In a British and a Canadian family with neonatal cholestasis caused by
C27 3-beta-HSD deficiency (607765), Cheng et al. (2003) found deletion
of AG at nucleotide 63 in exon 1 of the HSD3B7 gene.

615495	TITLE *615495 GDP-MANNOSE PYROPHOSPHORYLASE A; GMPPA
;;GDP-MANNOSE PYROPHOSPHORYLASE, ALPHA SUBUNIT;;
GMPP-ALPHA
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

GMPPA is a homolog of GDP-mannose pyrophosphorylase B (GMPPB; 615320),
which catalyzes the synthesis of GDP-mannose from mannose-1-phosphate
and GTP. GMPPA and GMPPB are present in roughly equal amounts in native
GDP-mannose pyrophosphorylase (EC 2.7.7.13), but only GMPPB exhibits
enzymatic activity. Compared with GMPPB, GMPPA has a 2-amino acid
insertion within a highly conserved nucleotide-binding motif that likely
inactivated it after the duplication event that produced GMPPA and
GMPPB. GMPPA may serve a regulatory role for GMPPB (Koehler et al.,
2013).

CLONING

Koehler et al. (2013) identified the GMPPA gene within a region of
chromosome 2 linked to alacrima, achalasia, and mental retardation
syndrome (AAMR; 615510). The deduced GMPPA protein contains 420 amino
acids. It has a predicted N-terminal nucleotidyltransferase domain
followed by a hexapeptide repeat domain. GMPPA shares 32% amino acid
identity with GMPPB. Northern blot analysis detected variable Gmppa
expression in all 17 mouse tissues examined, with highest expression in
adrenal gland and testis, and lowest expression in lung and spleen. In
situ hybridization of day-17.5 mouse embryo found Gmppa expression in
many tissues, including cortex, stomach, intestine, submandibular gland,
and sublingual gland. Epitope-tagged human GMPPA was expressed in a
diffuse cytoplasmic pattern in transfected COS-7 cells. Database
analysis revealed orthologs of GMPPA in mammals and fish, and all had
the inactivating 2-amino acid insertion compared with GMPPB.

GENE FUNCTION

Koehler et al. (2013) stated that GMPPA binds GDP-mannose, but that it
does not show catalytic activity.

MAPPING

Hartz (2013) mapped the GMPPA gene to chromosome 2q35 based on an
alignment of the GMPPA sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF135422) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 13 patients from 9 unrelated families with alacrima, achalasia, and
mental retardation syndrome (AAMR; 615510), Koehler et al. (2013)
identified 9 different homozygous mutations in the GMPPA gene (see,
e.g., 615495.0001-615495.0005). The mutation in the first family was
found by linkage analysis and whole-exome sequencing. The subsequent
mutations were identified by sequencing the GMPPA gene in 63 families
with alacrima and achalasia who were negative for mutations in the AAAS
gene (605378). Immunoblot analysis of patient cells with missense
mutations showed lower levels of GMPPA compared to controls, consistent
with a loss of function. However, GDP-mannose levels were significantly
higher in patient cells compared to controls, whereas other nucleotide
diphosphate sugars were unchanged. There was no evidence of alterations
in N-glycosylation profiles in patients: serum transferrin,
immunoglobulin G, and serum Apo-CIII glycosylation profiles were similar
to those in controls. Koehler et al. (2013) suggested that changes
induced by GDP-mannose overload might only be significant in restricted
cell types or affect other glycosylation types, or may lead to
perturbations in the levels of other guanine nucleotides. Alternatively,
GMPPA might serve as a regulatory subunit. The clinical features of the
patients with mutations indicated that GMPPA is important in neurons and
autonomic nerve fibers innervating the distal esophageal sphincter or
the lacrimal glands.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
ALACRIMA, ACHALASIA, AND MENTAL RETARDATION SYNDROME
GMPPA, ARG99TER

In 3 sibs, born of consanguineous Pakistani parents, with alacrima,
achalasia, and mental retardation syndrome (AAMR; 615510), Koehler et
al. (2013) identified a homozygous c.295C-T transition in exon 5 of the
GMPPA gene, resulting in an arg99-to-ter (R99X) substitution. The
mutation, which was found by linkage analysis and whole-exome sequencing
and confirmed by Sanger sequencing, was not present in the dbSNP, 1000
Genomes Project, or Exome Variant Server databases, or in 200 in-house
control exomes. Cells transfected with the mutation showed no GMPPA
immunostaining, consistent with a loss of function.

GMPPA, THR334PRO

In 2 brothers, born of consanguineous Arab parents, with AAMR (615510),
Koehler et al. (2013) identified a homozygous c.1000A-C transversion in
exon 12 of the GMPPA gene, resulting in a thr334-to-pro (T334P)
substitution. The variant was not present in the dbSNP, 1000 Genomes
Project, or Exome Variant Server databases, or in 200 in-house control
exomes.

resulting in a gly182-to-asp (G182D) substitution. The variant was not
present in the dbSNP, 1000 Genomes Project, or Exome Variant Server

deletion (c.210delA) in exon 4 of the GMPPA gene, resulting in a
frameshift and premature truncation (Ala71ProfsTer19). The variant was
not present in the dbSNP, 1000 Genomes Project, or Exome Variant Server

;;CONE PHOTORECEPTOR cGMP-GATED CHANNEL;;
CYCLIC NUCLEOTIDE-GATED CHANNEL, OLFACTORY, 3; CNG3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) cation channels are essential in visual
and olfactory signal transduction. These proteins, CNG1 (123825) and
CNG2 (300338), are encoded by 2 different genes. The CNG1 channel is
activated at 40-fold higher cGMP concentrations than the CNG2 channel.
Biel et al. (1994) cloned an additional member of the cGMP-gated channel
family, termed CNG3, from bovine kidney. Its deduced amino acid sequence
was found to be 60% and 62% identical with the CNG-channel proteins from
bovine rod outer segment and bovine olfactory epithelium, respectively.
Northern analysis and RT-PCR showed that the CNG3 mRNA is present in
testis, kidney, and heart. Biel et al. (1994) suggested that chemotaxis
of sperm cells may be controlled during fertilization by a mechanism
similar to olfactory signal transduction because testis expresses
members of the olfactory-receptor gene family.

In complete achromatopsia, cone photoreceptors, the retinal sensory
neurons mediating color vision, seem viable but fail to generate an
electrical response to light. The CNGA3 gene encodes one of a family of
alpha subunits that form CNG ion channels required for sensory
transduction in rod photoreceptors and in olfactory neurons. The CNG3
channel consists of CNGA3 and CNGB3 (605080) in a heterotetrameric
structure of 2 alpha and 2 beta subunits (Sundin et al., 2000).

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Zhong et al. (2002) reported the identification of a leucine zipper
homology domain named CLZ (carboxy-terminal leucine zipper) that is
present in the distal C terminus of CNG channel A subunits but is absent
from B subunits and mediates an inter-subunit interaction. With
crosslinking, nondenaturing gel electrophoresis, and analytical
centrifugation, this CLZ domain was found to mediate a trimeric
interaction. In addition, a mutant cone CNG channel A subunit with its
CLZ domain replaced by a generic trimeric leucine zipper produced
channels that behaved much like the wildtype, but less so if replaced by
a dimeric or tetrameric leucine zipper. This A-subunit-only, trimeric
interaction suggested that heteromeric CNG channels actually adopt a
3A:1B stoichiometry. Biochemical analysis of the purified bovine rod CNG
channel confirmed this conclusion. Zhong et al. (2002) concluded that
this revised stoichiometry provides a new foundation for understanding
the structure and function of the CNG channel family.

GENE FAMILY

Yau (1994) reviewed the expanding family of cyclic nucleotide-gated
channels.

MAPPING

Wissinger et al. (1998) performed linkage analysis in 8 families with
total colorblindness (216900), also known as rod monochromacy or
achromatopsia, an autosomal recessively inherited condition. Linkage was
found with markers located at the pericentromeric region of chromosome
2. Further homozygosity mapping refined the locus to an interval of
approximately 3 cM covering the locus, which they designated ACHM2.
Radiation hybrid mapping of the CNGA3 gene resulted in a maximum lod
score of 16.1 with marker D2S2311, which had been shown to be closely
situated to the ACHM2 locus. The findings indicated that the CNGA3 gene
mapped within the critical interval of the ACHM2 locus.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Kohl et al. (1998) screened the CNGA3 gene in patients from 5 rod
monochromacy families in which linkage to 2q11 had been established. In
one family, affected members were homozygous for a pro163-to-leu
missense mutation (P163L; 600053.0001). In a second family, homozygosity
for an arg283-to-trp missense mutation was found (R283W; 600053.0002).
Compound heterozygosity was found in other patients. Notably, 7 of the 8
mutations identified by Kohl et al. (1998) were in exon 7; the
exceptional mutation, P163L, was located in exon 5.

Wissinger et al. (2001) screened for CNGA3 mutations in 258 independent
families with hereditary cone photoreceptor disorders and found CNGA3
mutations not only in patients with the complete form of achromatopsia,
but also in patients with incomplete achromatopsia and even in a few
patients diagnosed with severe progressive cone dystrophy. Mutations
were identified in 53 families and included 8 previously described
mutations and 38 novel mutations. These mutations comprised 39 amino
acid substitutions, 4 stop-codon mutations, two 1-bp insertions, and one
3-bp in-frame deletion. Most of the amino acid substitutions affected
residues conserved in the CNG channel family and were clustered at the
cytoplasmic face of transmembrane domains (TM) S1 and S2, in TM S4, and
in the cGMP-binding domain. Four mutations, arg277 to cys (R277C;
600053.0009), arg283 to trp (R283W; 600053.0002), arg436 to trp (R435W;
600053.0010), and phe547 to leu (F547L; 600053.0006), accounted for
41.8% of all the detected mutations.

Wiszniewski et al. (2007) analyzed the CNGA3, CNGB3, and GNAT2 (139340)
genes in 16 unrelated patients with autosomal recessive ACHM: 10
patients had mutations in CNGB3, 3 had mutations in CNGA3, and no coding
region mutations were found in 3 patients. The authors concluded that
CNGA3 and CNGB3 mutations are responsible for the substantial majority
of achromatopsia.

- Associations Pending Confirmation

In a female patient from a consanguineous Saudi Arabian family who had
been diagnosed with Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA; see 204000), Wang
et al. (2011) identified homozygosity for a missense mutation in the
CNGA3 gene (1579G-C; L527M) that segregated with disease in the family.
The mutation, located at a conserved residue in the cGMP-binding domain,
was not found in 200 controls or in the dbSNP130 or 1000 Genomes
databases. The female patient had nystagmus noted shortly after birth,
and electroretinogram was nonrecordable at 10 months of age. At 2 years
of age she was noted to have very sluggish pupils and no visual
responses were elicited.

ANIMAL MODEL

Hattar et al. (2003) investigated whether photoreceptor systems besides
rod-cone and melanopsin participate in pupillary reflex, light-induced
phase delays of the circadian clock, and period lengthening of the
circadian rhythm in constant light. Using mice lacking rods and cones,
Hattar et al. (2003) measured the action spectrum for phase-shifting the
circadian rhythm of locomotor behavior. This spectrum matched that for
the pupillary light reflex in mice of the same genotype, and that for
the intrinsic photosensitivity of the melanopsin-expressing retinal
ganglion cells. Hattar et al. (2003) also generated triple-knockout mice
(for Gnat, 139330, Cnga3, and Opn4, 606665) in which the rod-cone and
melanopsin systems were both silenced. These animals had an intact
retina but failed to show any significant pupil reflex, to entrain to
light/dark cycles, and to show any masking response to light. Thus,
Hattar et al. (2003) concluded that the rod-cone and melanopsin systems
together seem to provide all of the photic input for these accessory
visual functions.

Ding et al. (2009) observed that Cnga3 protein and mRNA levels were
significantly decreased in Cngb3 -/- mice; in contrast, mRNA levels of
S-opsin (CBD; 303800), Gnat2, and Pde6c (600827) were unchanged relative
to wildtype mice. The authors concluded that loss of CNGB3 reduces
biosynthesis of CNGA3 and impairs cone CNG channel function. They
suggested that downregulation of CNGA3 may contribute to the pathogenic
mechanism by which CNGB3 mutations lead to human cone disease.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
ROD MONOCHROMACY
CNGA3, PRO163LEU

Kohl et al. (1998) found that affected members in a family with rod
monochromacy (216900) were homozygous for a C-to-T transition at
nucleotide 528 of the CNGA3 gene, resulting in a pro163-to-leu (P163L)
substitution.

.0002
ROD MONOCHROMACY
CNGA3, ARG283TRP

In affected members of a family with rod monochromacy (216900), Kohl et
al. (1998) found homozygosity for a C-to-T transition at nucleotide 887
of the CNGA3 gene, resulting in an arg283-to-trp (R283W) substitution.

Wissinger et al. (2001) found the R283W mutation in 19 of 110 mutant
alleles, including 14 alleles in 7 homozygous patients. Haplotype
analysis suggested that these alleles, which were particularly frequent
among patients from Scandinavia and northern Italy, have a common
origin. Some of the patients homozygous for this mutation had complete
achromatopsia with no detectable cone function, whereas others had
incomplete achromatopsia with residual cone ERG responses and/or color
vision.

.0003
ROD MONOCHROMACY
CNGA3, ARG283GLN

Kohl et al. (1998) found that a single patient with rod monochromacy
(216900) was a compound heterozygote. One mutation was arg283 to gln
(R283Q), involving the same codon as the arg283-to-trp mutation
(600053.0002). The nucleotide change was G to A at nucleotide 888. The
second allele, of maternal origin, carried a G-to-A mutation at
nucleotide 1709, resulting in a gly557-to-arg (G557R) substitution
(600053.0004).

See 600053.0003 and Kohl et al. (1998).

.0005
ROD MONOCHROMACY
CNGA3, THR291ARG

Kohl et al. (1998) found compound heterozygosity of mutations in the
CNGA3 gene as the basis of rod monochromacy (216900) in one family:
thr291 to arg (T291R) and phe547 to leu (F547L; 600053.0006), where the
2 allelic mutations were caused by a C-to-G transversion at nucleotide
912 and C-to-A transversion at nucleotide 1681, respectively.

.0006
ROD MONOCHROMACY
CNGA3, PHE547LEU

See 600053.0005 and Kohl et al. (1998).

Wissinger et al. (2001) found the F547L mutation in 12 of 110 mutant
alleles and from patients from German, Dutch, Italian, Turkish, and
Pakistani families. Haplotype analysis suggested multiple origins of the
mutation.

.0007
ROD MONOCHROMACY
CNGA3, ARG411TRP

Kohl et al. (1998) found compound heterozygosity for mutations in the
CNGA3 gene in a sibship with 2 affected individuals with rod
monochromacy (216900). A C-to-T transition at nucleotide 1268 caused a
substitution of tryptophan for arginine at codon 411. The second
pathologic change was val529 to met (600053.0008).

.0008
ROD MONOCHROMACY
CNGA3, VAL529MET

In 2 sibs with rod monochromacy (216900), Kohl et al. (1998) identified
compound heterozygosity at the CNGA locus: one allele carried the
arg411-to-trp mutation (600053.0007); the other allele carried 2
changes, thr153 to met and val529 to met (V529M), of which the V529M
appeared to be the pathologic change. The V529M mutation was said to be
caused by a G-to-A transition at nucleotide 1625.

Zelinger et al. (2010) performed mutation analysis of more than 700
families from the Israeli and Palestinian populations with inherited
retinal diseases and identified the V529M mutation, caused by a 1585G-A
transition, in 10 of 30 families with achromatopsia, including 6 Arab
Muslim families and 4 Oriental Jewish families. Mutation carrier
frequencies were estimated at 0.8% and 1%, respectively. In addition,
V529M was identified in 3 previously unreported Christian European
families. The European patients were all compound heterozygous for V529M
and another CNGA3 mutation, whereas most of the Arab Muslim and Jewish
patients were homozygous for V529M. Haplotype analysis of
mutation-bearing chromosomes from Middle Eastern and European patients
revealed a shared Muslim-Jewish haplotype, which was different from the
haplotypes detected in European patients, indicating a recurrent
mutation stratified by a Jewish-Muslim founder effect. Microsatellite
analysis of a 21.5-cM interval including CNGA3 and the adjacent
chromosome 2 centromere revealed a unique and extremely rare haplotype
associated with the V529M mutation. The shared mutation was calculated
to have arisen about 200 generations earlier, in an ancient common
ancestor who lived approximately 5,000 years ago.

.0009
ROD MONOCHROMACY
CNGA3, ARG277CYS

In patients with rod monochromacy (216900), Wissinger et al. (2001)
identified a C-to-T transition at nucleotide 829 of the CNGA3 gene,
resulting in an arg277-to-cys (R277C) substitution; the mutation was
found in 9 of 110 mutant alleles.

.0010
ROD MONOCHROMACY
CNGA3, ARG436TRP

In patients with rod monochromacy (216900), Wissinger et al. (2001)
identified a C-to-T transition at nucleotide 1306 of the CNGA3 gene,
resulting in an arg436-to-trp (R436W) substitution; the mutation was
found in 6 of 110 mutant alleles. All but 1 of the patients with this
mutation were of German origin. Haplotype analysis suggested multiple
origins of the mutation.

615020	TITLE *615020 ELONGATOR ACETYLTRANSFERASE COMPLEX, SUBUNIT 6; ELP6
;;TRANSMEMBRANE PROTEIN 103; TMEM103;;
CHROMOSOME 3 OPEN READING FRAME 75; C3ORF75
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ELP6 is 1 of 6 subunits of the elongator complex. Elongator promotes RNA
polymerase II transcript elongation through histone acetylation in the
nucleus and also regulates translational fidelity through tRNA
modification in the cytoplasm (summary by Close et al., 2012).

CLONING

By mass spectrometric analysis of proteins that copurified with the
elongator complex in HEK293 cells, Close et al. (2012) identified ELP6.
SDS-PAGE detected ELP6 at an apparent molecular mass of 30 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

Using RNA interference, Close et al. (2012) found that depletion of any
of the elongator complex components Elp1 (IKBKAP; 603722), Elp3
(612722), Elp5 (615019), or Elp6 in B16-F10 mouse melanoma cells reduced
cell motility in a wound-healing assay and reduced the capacity of cells
to form colonies in soft agar.

MAPPING

Hartz (2013) mapped the ELP6 gene to chromosome 3p21.31 based on an
alignment of the ELP6 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK000218) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

602770	TITLE *602770 CHROMOBOX HOMOLOG 2, DROSOPHILA POLYCOMB CLASS; CBX2
;;M33, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

'Polycomb' genes in Drosophila maintain the repressed state of homeotic
and other developmentally regulated genes (Wedeen et al., 1986; Kuziora
and McGinnis, 1988) by mediating changes in higher-order chromatin
structure (Paro and Hogness, 1991). M33, a mouse homolog of polycomb,
was isolated by means of the structural similarity of its chromodomain
(Pearce et al., 1992). The fifth exon of M33 contains a region of
homology shared by Drosophila and Xenopus. In Drosophila, its deletion
results in the loss of polycomb function.

CLONING

Gecz et al. (1995) isolated genomic clones of the human M33 homolog,
which they designated CBX2.

MAPPING

By analysis of somatic cell hybrids and by fluorescence in situ
hybridization, Gecz et al. (1995) mapped the CBX2 gene to 17q25.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Biason-Lauber et al. (2009) identified 2 missense mutations in the CBX2
gene in a patient who was prenatally identified as having a 46,XY
karyotype and born with completely normal external and internal female
genitalia.

ANIMAL MODEL

Katoh-Fukui et al. (1998) disrupted the M33 gene in mice by inserting a
poly(A) targeting vector into its fifth exon. More than half of the
resultant homozygous mutant mice died before weaning, and survivors
showed male-to-female sex reversal. Formation of genital ridges was
retarded in both XX and XY homozygous mutant embryos. Gonadal growth
defects appeared near the time of expression of the
Y-chromosome-specific Sry gene (480000), suggesting that M33 deficiency
may cause sex reversal by interfering with steps upstream of Sry.
Katoh-Fukui et al. (1998) pointed out that point mutations in the human
SOX9 gene (608160) cause campomelic dysplasia (CMPD1; 114290) associated
with male sex reversal. Because M33 is located distal to Sox9 on mouse
chromosome 11 with a linkage of 5.3 cM, the possibility that Sox9 was
affected coincidentally during gene targeting in ES cells was
considered. However, this possibility was ruled out by other transgenic
experiments. Katoh-Fukui et al. (1998) suggested that these homozygous
M33-mutant mice represent the first case in which male-to-female gonadal
sex reversal results from a defect in a known recessive gene.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
46,XY SEX REVERSAL 5
CBX2, PRO98LEU

In a child whose prenatally determined karyotype was 46,XY but who was
born a phenotypically normal female (613080), Biason-Lauber et al.
(2009) identified on the paternal allele a C-to-T transition at
nucleotide 293 of the CBX2 gene resulting in a pro-to-leu substitution
at codon 98 (P98L). The maternal allele contained an arg443-to-pro
mutation (602770.0002).

.0002
46,XY SEX REVERSAL 5
CBX2, ARG443PRO

In a phenotypically normal female with 46,XY karyotype (613080),
Biason-Lauber et al. (2009) identified a G-to-C transversion at
nucleotide 1370 of the CBX2 gene that resulted in an arg-to-pro
substitution at codon 443 (R443P). Both this mutation, on the maternal
allele, and the mutation on the paternal allele (602770.0001) occurred
in exon 5. Neither mutation was identified in 160 unrelated individuals.

;;MYSTIQUE;;
STAT-INTERACTING LIM PROTEIN; SLIM
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Torrado et al. (2004) cloned rat Pdlim2 from eye total RNA. They
identified human PDLIM2 clones in retina, lens, retinal pigment
epithelium/choroid, and fetal eye cDNA libraries. Northern blot analysis
detected high expression in rat cornea and lower expression in sclera,
lung, and combined trabecular meshwork, iris, and ciliary body. No
expression was detected in retina. In situ hybridization of rat eye
tissues detected Pdlim2 in corneal epithelial cells, but not in corneal
stroma or endothelium or in other ocular tissues.

By searching a database for sequences similar to mouse Mystique,
followed by RT-PCR of breast cancer cell line mRNA, Loughran et al.
(2005) cloned 3 human Mystique variants that they called Mystique-1, -2,
and -3. The deduced proteins contain 366, 352, and 278 amino acids and
have calculated molecular masses of 39.2, 37.5, and 29.1 kD,
respectively. Mystique-1 and -2 have an N-terminal PDZ domain and a
C-terminal LIM domain separated by about 200 amino acids, but they
differ at their C termini. Mystique-3 has only the PDZ domain due to the
absence of exon 9 and introduction of a premature stop codon. RT-PCR
suggested there may be 2 additional human Mystique splice variants.
Northern blot analysis of mouse tissues showed tissue-specific
expression of 3 Mystique splice variants. Mystique-2 was the predominant
transcript in most tissues and was highly expressed in lung. Transient
expression of the 3 human cDNAs in HeLa cells showed Mystique-1 and -2
predominantly localized at the cytoskeleton and Mystique-3 localized
predominantly in the nucleus and more weakly near the cytoskeleton.
Western blot analysis detected endogenous Mystique-2 at an apparent
molecular mass of 37.5 kD in 3 of 5 human cell lines examined; other
Mystique isoforms were not detected. Mystique-2 colocalized with
alpha-actinin (see ACTN1; 102575) and beta-1-integrin (ITGB1; 135630) in
breast cancer cells.

By yeast 2-hybrid screening of a mouse Th1 clone cDNA library using the
N-terminal 133 amino acids of mouse Stat4 (600558) as bait, Tanaka et
al. (2005) isolated Pdlim2, which they called Slim. The predicted
349-amino acid mouse Slim protein has an N-terminal PDZ domain and a
C-terminal LIM domain. Northern blot analysis of mouse tissues detected
highest expression of Slim in lung, with strong expression in spleen and
thymus as well. Slim was highly expressed in primary mouse Cd4
(186940)-positive T cells, Cd8 (see 186910)-positive T cells, B cells,
macrophages, and dendritic cells. Western blot analysis showed that Slim
was present in nuclear but not cytoplasmic extracts of primary
Cd4-positive T cells both before and after stimulation with Il12 (see
161560).

GENE FUNCTION

Torrado et al. (2004) found that Pdlim2 coimmunoprecipitated with Actn1,
Actn4 (604638), filamin A (FLNA; 300017), and myosin heavy polypeptide-9
(MYH9; 160775) in rat corneal and lung extracts. Myosin VI (MYO6;
600970) coimmunoprecipitated with Pdlim2 from corneal but not lung
extracts. Alpha-actinins were the most abundant immunoprecipitated
proteins. Pull-down assays and gel overlay assays with purified proteins
confirmed direct interaction of Pdlim2 with alpha-actinins and filamin.
Pdlim2 and alpha-actinins colocalized mainly to stress fibers after
transfection into COS-7 cells, and complexes of Pdlim2 and Actn1
preferentially located along the basal aspect.

Loughran et al. (2005) found that expression of human Mystique-2 was
induced by IGF1 (147440) and cell adhesion. Overexpression of Mystique-2
in a breast cancer cell line suppressed anchorage-independent growth and
enhanced cell adhesion to collagen (see 120150) and fibronectin (FN1;
135600). Point mutation within either the PDZ and LIM domains reversed
the growth suppression, whereas mutation of the PDZ domain alone
abolished the enhancement of cell adhesion. Knockdown of Mystique-2 with
small interfering RNA abrogated both adhesion and migration in 2 breast
cancer cell lines. Loughran et al. (2005) concluded that Mystique is an
IGF1R (147370)-regulated adaptor protein located at the actin
cytoskeleton that is necessary for epithelial cell migration.

By yeast 2-hybrid, coimmunoprecipitation, and Western blot analyses,
Tanaka et al. (2005) showed that mouse Slim interacted with
tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat4. Cotransfection analysis revealed that
Slim impaired Stat-mediated gene expression and that Slim possessed
ubiquitin E3 ligase activity. Immunoblot analysis also showed that Slim
promoted degradation and dephosphorylation of Stat4. Slim -/-
Cd4-positive mouse T cells showed enhanced Ifng (147570) production, and
Slim -/- mice had an enhanced inflammatory response in liver to
heat-killed Listeria monocytogenes and higher levels of Stat1 (600555)
and Stat4 proteins compared with wildtype mice. Tanaka et al. (2005)
concluded that SLIM regulates both the level of STAT protein expression
and the extent of STAT activation, and thus the amount of IFNG produced
following CD4-positive T-cell stimulation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Loughran et al. (2005) determined that the PDLIM2 gene contains 12 exons
and spans about 20 kb. The translation start codon is in exon 2.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Loughran et al. (2005) mapped the PDLIM2
gene to chromosome 8p21.2.

ANIMAL MODEL

Tanaka et al. (2005) found that Slim -/- mice were healthy and fertile.
Slim -/- mice showed enhanced Ifng production by Cd4-positive T cells,
enhanced inflammatory response in liver to heat-killed Listeria
monocytogenes, and higher levels of Stat proteins compared with wildtype
mice.

300506	TITLE *300506 TSC22 DOMAIN FAMILY, MEMBER 3; TSC22D3
;;DELTA SLEEP-INDUCING PEPTIDE, IMMUNOREACTOR; DSIPI;;
GLUCOCORTICOID-INDUCED LEUCINE ZIPPER; GILZ
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The Drosophila 'shortsighted' (shs) protein, which is necessary for
photoreceptor differentiation, is a homolog of the mouse
TGF-beta-1-inducible protein Tsc22 (607715). Both of these proteins, as
well as the porcine protein DIP (DSIP-immunoreactive peptide), are
leucine zipper proteins that lack an N-terminal basic DNA-binding
region. Vogel et al. (1996) screened a human fetal brain cDNA library
with a porcine DIP cDNA fragment and isolated a 420-bp cDNA that encodes
a predicted 122-amino acid protein. The putative DSIPI protein exhibits
high identity with porcine DIP, differing in just 4 positions. Sequence
comparisons revealed a highly conserved leucine zipper region in DSIPI,
Tsc22, and shs. RT-PCR analysis demonstrated widespread distribution of
the DSIPI protein among various human tissues.

Using mouse Gilz to screen a human T-lymphocyte cDNA library, Cannarile
et al. (2001) cloned full-length GILZ. The deduced 135-amino acid
protein has a calculated molecular mass of 15 kD. GILZ contains a
leucine zipper, a C-terminal proline-rich and acidic region, an
N-glycosylation site, and several sites for threonine and serine
phosphorylation. Northern blot analysis detected highest GILZ expression
in brain, lung, spleen, skeletal muscle, and in all hematopoietic cell
lineages examined. Lower expression was found in heart and kidney, and
no expression was found in liver and pancreas. Western blot analysis
found complete concordance between mRNA and protein expression,
suggesting that GILZ expression is regulated at the transcriptional
level.

GENE FUNCTION

Cannarile et al. (2001) found that expression of GILZ increased in human
peripheral blood leukocytes, monocytes, and CD3 (see 186740)-positive
cells following dexamethasone treatment.

Berrebi et al. (2003) found that mouse and human macrophages produced
GILZ in noninflamed tissues, and production by macrophages was
stimulated by glucocorticoids and by IL10 (124092), both in vitro and in
vivo. In addition, GILZ inhibited the expression of Toll-like receptors
(TLRs; see 601194) and molecules involved in antigen presentation and
inflammation. GILZ expression was downregulated in macrophages from
inflammatory lesions of delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions, whereas
it persisted in tumor-infiltrating macrophages from Burkitt lymphomas
(113970).

GILZ appears to modulate the response of T lymphocytes to stimulation of
the T-cell receptor (TCR). Overexpression of GILZ in a murine lymphoid
cell line inhibited anti-CD3-induced apoptosis via downregulation of FAS
(134637)/FASL (134638) expression and also significantly affected
interleukin-2 (IL2; 147680) production and expression of IL2 receptor
(IL2R; 147730) (Ayroldi et al., 2001). GILZ may exert its effects by
interfering at various stages of the signaling pathways that are
triggered by TCR stimulation. Interleukin-2 withdrawal is a physiologic
process inducing cell death in activated T lymphocytes. Asselin-Labat et
al. (2004) reported that IL2 deprivation leads to expression of GILZ in
T lymphocytes. They characterized the GILZ promoter and showed that
forkhead box class O3 (FOXO3; 602681) binding to the foxhead responsive
elements identified in the promoter is necessary for induction of GILZ
expression when IL2 is withdrawn. GILZ overexpression protected CTLL2
cells from IL2 withdrawal-induced apoptosis, whereas cell death was
accelerated in cells unable to express GILZ. These and other experiments
indicated that GILZ is a transiently expressed protein induced upon IL2
withdrawal that protects T cells from the onset of apoptosis.

Ayroldi et al. (2007) demonstrated that Gilz interacted directly with
Ras (HRAS; 190020) in vitro and in vivo as shown by Gilz and Ras
coimmunoprecipitation and colocalization upon phorbol ester activation
in primary mouse spleen T lymphocytes and thymus cells. Analysis of Gilz
mutants showed that they bound Ras through the TSC box, and depending on
the Ras activation levels, formed a trimeric complex with Ras and Raf
(RAF1; 164760). As a consequence of these interactions, Gilz diminished
activation of Ras and Raf downstream targets, leading to inhibition of
Ras- and Raf-dependent cell proliferation and Ras-induced mouse
fibroblast transformation. Gilz silencing resulted in an increase in
concanavalin A-induced T cell proliferation and inhibition of
dexamethasone antiproliferative effects. Ayroldi et al. (2007) concluded
that GILZ is a negative regulator of RAS- and RAF-induced proliferation
and is a mediator of the antiproliferative effects of glucocorticoids.

MAPPING

By FISH, Cannarile et al. (2001) mapped the DSIPI gene to chromosome
Xq22.2.

600960	TITLE *600960 SET TRANSLOCATION, MYELOID LEUKEMIA-ASSOCIATED; SET
;;INHIBITOR OF GZMA-ACTIVATED DNase; IGAAD
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The translocation (6;9)(p23q34) is the hallmark of a specific subtype of
acute myeloid leukemia (AML) characterized by a poor prognosis and a
young age of onset. It is classified in the French-American-British
(FAB) system mostly as M2/M4 and rarely as M1 or refractive anemia with
excess of blast cells (RAEB). On chromosome 9, breakpoints take place in
a specific intron, denoted icb-9, of a large gene named Cain (CAN;
114350). On chromosome 6, breakpoints occur in a single intron, icb-6,
of a gene named DEK (125264). In a patient with acute undifferentiated
leukemia and an apparently normal karyotype, von Lindern et al. (1992)
found a breakpoint in icb-9 of the CAN gene in a bone marrow sample but
detected no breakpoint in DEK. They isolated and characterized a novel
gene, named SET (suppressor of variegation, enhancer of zeste, and
Trithorax), that was fused to CAN in the leukemic cells of this patient.
A chimeric SET-CAN transcript whose sequence predicted a fusion protein
of 155 kD was detected. The SET gene encodes transcripts of 2.0 and 2.7
kb that result from the use of alternative polyadenylation sites. Both
transcripts contained the open reading frame for a putative protein with
a predicted molecular mass of 32 kD. The SET sequence showed homology
with the yeast nucleosome assembly protein NAP-I. The only common
sequence motif of SET and DEK proteins is an acidic region. SET has a
long acidic tail, of which a large part is present in the predicted
SET-CAN fusion protein.

GENE FUNCTION

Carlson et al. (1998) studied the role of SET in the regulation of renal
cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. The mRNA encoding SET was
expressed at much higher levels in transformed human and rodent cell
lines than in cultured renal epithelial and primary endothelial cells.
Consistent with a role for SET in cell proliferation, SET mRNA
expression was markedly reduced in cells rendered quiescent by serum
starvation, contact inhibition, or differentiation. Previous findings
during renal development were extended by demonstrating that SET protein
expression is also much greater in developing rat and human kidney than
in fully differentiated, mature kidney. Finally, high levels of SET mRNA
and SET protein expression were found in Wilms tumor but not in renal
cell carcinoma, adult polycystic kidney disease, or in transitional cell
carcinoma. The SET domain (Tschiersch et al., 1994) is found in proteins
that are involved in embryonic development (Tripoulas et al., 1996).

Granzyme A (GZMA; 140050) induces a caspase-independent cell death
pathway characterized by single-stranded DNA nicks and other features of
apoptosis. A GZMA-activated DNase (GAAD) is in an endoplasmic
reticulum-associated complex containing pp32 (600832) and the GZMA
substrates SET, HMG2 (163906), and APE1 (107748). Fan et al. (2003)
showed that GAAD is NM23H1 (156490), a nucleoside diphosphate kinase
implicated in suppression of tumor metastasis, and its specific
inhibitor (IGAAD) is SET. NM23H1 bound SET and was released from
inhibition by GZMA cleavage of SET. After GZMA loading or cytotoxic T
lymphocyte attack, SET and NM23H1 translocated to the nucleus and SET
was degraded, allowing NM23H1 to nick chromosomal DNA. GZMA-treated
cells with silenced NM23H1 expression were resistant to GZMA-mediated
DNA damage and cytolysis, while cells overexpressing NM23H1 were more
sensitive.

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis using the N-terminal 277 amino acids of SET
as bait, Minakuchi et al. (2001) identified SET-binding protein-1
(SETBP1; 611060). Deletion and mutagenesis analysis revealed that amino
acids 182 to 223 of SET interacted with amino acids 1238 to 1434 of
SETBP1. Immunoprecipitation analysis verified that SETBP1 interacted
with endogenous SET in a human osteosarcoma cell line.

Ischemia and seizure cause excessive neuronal excitation that is
associated with brain acidosis and neuronal cell death. Liu et al.
(2008) found that the neurotoxin kainic acid activated lysosomal
asparagine endopeptidase (AEP, or LGMN; 602620) in mouse brain and
triggered degradation of Set, followed by DNA nicking and neuronal cell
death. Pike-L (CENTG1; 605476) strongly bound Set in the nucleus and
protected Set from proteolytic cleavage by Aep in vitro and in vivo,
thereby diminishing DNA damage and neuronal cell death. Kainic acid or
stroke failed to provoke DNA nicking and neuronal cell death in
Aep-deficient mice.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, von Lindern et al. (1992)
assigned the SET gene to 9q34, centromeric of ABL (189980).

182141	TITLE *182141 SEMENOGELIN II; SEMG2
DESCRIPTION Ulvsback et al. (1992) characterized the genes for semenogelin I
(182140) and II, the major protein constituents of the human seminal
fluid, by 3 overlapping clones in bacteriophage lambda, encompassing
31.5 kb of genomic DNA. They found that the 2 genes are located 11.5 kb
apart in the region 20q12-q13.1. Both genes are relatively compact,
spanning only 2.7 and 3.1 kb, respectively. The transcription units are
composed of 3 exons, of which the first encodes the signal peptide, the
second encodes secreted protein, and the third contains solely 3-prime,
noncoding nucleotides. The nucleotide sequences exhibited a similarity
of close to 90% in the exons and greater than 80% in the introns and
flanking nucleotides.

Postcopulatory sperm competition is a key aspect of sexual selection and
is believed to drive the rapid evolution of both reproductive physiology
and reproduction-related genes. It is well established that mating
behavior determines the intensity of sperm competition, with polyandry
(i.e., female promiscuity) leading to fiercer sperm competition than
monandry. Studies in mammals, particularly primates, showed that, owing
to greater sperm competition, polyandrous taxa generally have
physiologic traits that make them better adapted for fertilization than
monandrous species, including bigger testes, larger seminal vesicles,
higher sperm counts, richer mitochondrial loading in sperm, and more
prominent semen coagulation. Dorus et al. (2004) showed that the degree
of polyandry can also impact the dynamics of molecular evolution.
Specifically, they showed that the evolution of the gene encoding
semenogelin II, a main structural component of semen coagulum, is
accelerated in polyandrous primates relative to monandrous primates.

614355	TITLE *614355 ACYL-CoA SYNTHETASE SHORT CHAIN FAMILY, MEMBER 1; ACSS1
;;ACYL-CoA SYNTHETASE 1; ACECS1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Fatty acids are incorporated into membranes and signaling molecules and
have roles in energy storage and metabolism. These essential functions
require activation of the fatty acid by acyl-coenzyme A (CoA)
synthetases, such as ACSS1, which form an activating thioester linkage
between the fatty acid and CoA (Watkins et al., 2007).

CLONING

Fujino et al. (2001) cloned mouse Acss1 and Acss2 (605832), which they
called Acecs1 and Acecs2, respectively. The deduced 701-amino acid Acss1
protein shares 45.8% identity with Acss2. Northern blot analysis
detected high expression of a 3.6-kb Acss1 transcript in liver, kidney,
and testis. Lower expression was detected in heart, brain, spleen, lung,
and skeletal muscle. Fractionation of mouse kidney revealed cytosolic
localization for Acss1 and mitochondrial localization for Acss2.

By database analysis, Watkins et al. (2007) identified human ACSS1. The
deduced 689-amino acid protein contains 4 of 5 motifs characteristic of
acyl-CoA synthetases. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that ACSS1 belongs
to a short chain clade of acyl-CoA synthetases.

GENE FUNCTION

By assaying proteins purified from transfected COS-7 cells, Fujino et
al. (2001) showed that both mouse Acss1 and Acss2 preferred acetate as
substrate for the synthesis of acetyl-CoA. Little to no activity was
detected with other short or medium chain fatty acids. Acss1 expression,
but not Acss2 expression, was induced by differentiation of mouse 3T3-L1
cells. In contrast, Acss2 expression, but not Acss1 expression, was
induced by fasting in mice and by diabetes in Zucker rats.

GENE STRUCTURE

Watkins et al. (2007) determined that the ACSS1 gene contains 14 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Watkins et al. (2007) mapped the ACSS1
gene to the minus strand of chromosome 20p11.23-p11.21.

610998	TITLE *610998 METEORIN; METRN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Meteorin regulates glial cell differentiation and promotes the formation
of axonal networks during neurogenesis (Nishino et al., 2004).

CLONING

Nishino et al. (2004) isolated Metrn as a cDNA clone that displayed
induced expression in a mouse pluripotent embryonal carcinoma line in
response to all-trans retinoic acid exposure. The deduced 290-amino acid
protein shares 82% amino acid identity with the 293-amino acid human
ortholog. Both human and mouse meteorin contain a putative N-terminal
signal peptide. Immunoblot analysis of cell fractions from Chinese
hamster ovary cells expressing mouse meteorin localized meteorin to the
lysate and culture supernatant, suggesting that meteorin is secreted. In
situ hybridization of developing mouse tissues showed predominant
meteorin expression in the central and peripheral nervous system in
neural progenitors, glial progenitors, and cells of the astrocyte
lineage.

GENE FUNCTION

Using purified His-tagged meteorin, Nishino et al. (2004) showed that
mouse meteorin induced neurite outgrowth in dorsal root ganglion (DRG)
explant cultures. Meteorin induction of neurite outgrowth showed an
additive effect with neurotrophin-3 (NTF3; 162660) but not with NGF
(NGFB; 162030) or BDNF (113505). Meteorin promotion of neurite outgrowth
was most apparent in high-density DRG cultures compared to cells at low
density. In satellite glial cells, meteorin induced a change in
morphology that was independent of cell density and induced
phosphorylation of intracellular ERK1 (MAPK3; 601795)/ERK2 (MAPK1;
176948). Nishino et al. (2004) concluded that meteorin acts directly on
satellite glial cells to induce a change in morphology and that
transformed satellite glial cells induce the secondary effect of neurite
extension. In cerebellar explants, meteorin induced conversion of
cerebellar astrocytes into radial glia and promoted astrocyte
differentiation from embryonic day 11.5 cerebral cortex neurospheres.
Nishino et al. (2004) concluded that meteorin acts on astrocyte
precursor cells that have committed to the astrocyte lineage.

MAPPING

Nishino et al. (2004) stated that the METRN gene maps to chromosome
16p13.3 and that the mouse Metrn gene maps to chromosome 17.

612844	TITLE *612844 SENTRIN-SPECIFIC PROTEASE FAMILY, MEMBER 3; SENP3
;;SUMO-SPECIFIC PROTEASE 3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The reversible posttranslational modification of proteins by the
addition of small ubiquitin-like SUMO proteins (see SUMO1; 601912) is
required for numerous biologic processes. SUMO-specific proteases, such
as SENP3, are responsible for the initial processing of SUMO precursors
to generate a C-terminal diglycine motif required for the conjugation
reaction. They also have isopeptidase activity for the removal of SUMO
from high molecular mass SUMO conjugates (Di Bacco et al., 2006).

CLONING

Gong and Yeh (2006) determined that C-terminal catalytic domain of the
deduced 574-amino acid SENP3 protein shares 62% identity with that of
SENP5 (612845). SENP3 and SENP5 also share 40% amino acid identity in a
region directly preceding the catalytic domain. Gong and Yeh (2006)
noted that SENP3 localizes to nucleoli.

Di Bacco et al. (2006) stated that the catalytic domain of SENP3
includes the catalytic triad of his, asp, and cys.

GENE FUNCTION

Yun et al. (2008) found that SENP3 and SENP5 colocalized with
nucleophosmin (NPM1; 164040), a protein involved in ribosome biogenesis,
within the granular component of the nucleolus. Codepletion of SENP3 and
SENP5 in HeLa cells via RNA interference (RNAi), but not depletion of
either SENP alone, increased the nucleolar content of SUMO1, SUMO2
(603042), and SUMO3 (602231). Depletion of SENP3 alone inhibited
production of 28S rRNA from the 32S precursor RNA, whereas depletion of
SENP5 alone reduced 47S transcription. RNAi-mediated depletion of
nucleophosmin reduced SENP3 and SENP5 levels, likely via increased
degradation rather than decreased expression. Codepletion of SENP3 and
SENP5 or depletion of nucleophosmin resulted in accumulation of
sumoylated RPL37A and GNL2 (609365) proteins within nucleoli. Xenopus
Senp5, which is highly similar to human SENP5, bound nucleophosmin in
Xenopus oocyte extracts. Yun et al. (2008) concluded that sumoylation of
nucleolar proteins by SENP3 and SENP5 is involved in the control of
ribosome biogenesis.

Using epitope-tagged SENP3 in a protein pull-down assay of HEK293 cell
lysates, Haindl et al. (2008) showed that SENP3 interacted with
nucleophosmin. SENP3 countered ARF (600160)-induced sumoylation of
nucleophosmin with SUMO2. Depletion of SENP3 by short interfering RNA
interfered with nucleolar ribosomal RNA processing and inhibited
conversion of the 32S rRNA species to the 28S form, phenocopying the
defect observed upon nucleophosmin depletion. Furthermore, mimicking
constitutive modification of nucleophosmin by SUMO2 interfered with 28S
rRNA maturation. Haindl et al. (2008) concluded that SENP3 is an
essential factor for ribosome biogenesis and that deconjugation of SUMO2
from nucleophosmin by SENP3 is critical for 28S rRNA maturation.

MAPPING

Hartz (2009) mapped the SENP3 gene to chromosome 17p13.1 based on an
alignment of the SENP3 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AL050283) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.1).

602727	TITLE *602727 CHLORIDE CHANNEL 7; CLCN7
;;CLC7
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Brandt and Jentsch (1995) identified regions of chloride channel
proteins that are highly conserved within a given branch of the CLCN
family but show significant divergence between branches. By RT-PCR using
degenerate oligonucleotides based on the CLCN6 (602726) sequence within
these branch-specific regions, Brandt and Jentsch (1995) cloned a rat
brain cDNA encoding Clcn7. Using the rat Clcn7 cDNA to screen a human
cerebral cortex cDNA library, they isolated a partial human CLCN7 cDNA
which lacked about 15 codons at the 5-prime end. The predicted amino
acid sequence of human CLCN7 is 45% identical to that of CLCN6 but only
about 21 to 30% identical to the sequences of other known CLCNs.
Therefore, Brandt and Jentsch (1995) stated that CLCN6 and CLCN7
together define a new branch of the CLCN family. The human and rat CLCN7
protein sequences are 96% identical. Northern blot analysis revealed
that CLCN7 is expressed broadly as an approximately 4.2-kb transcript.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Brandt and Jentsch (1995) mapped
the CLCN7 gene to 16p13.

GENE FUNCTION

Lange et al. (2006) showed that CLCN7 and OSTM1 (607649) proteins
colocalize in late endosomes amd lysosomes of various tissues, as well
as in the ruffled border of bone-resorbing osteoclasts.
Coimmunoprecipitations showed that CLCN7 and OSTM1 form a molecular
complex and suggested that OSTM1 is a beta subunit of CLCN7. CLCN7 is
required for OSTM1 to reach lysosomes, where the highly glycosylated
OSTM1 luminal domain is cleaved. Protein but not RNA levels of Clcn7 are
greatly reduced in grey-lethal mice, which lack Ostm1, suggesting that
the Clcn7-Ostm1 interaction is important for protein stability. As Clcn7
protein levels in Ostm1-deficient tissues and cells, including
osteoclasts, are decreased below 10% of normal levels, Ostm1 mutations
probably cause osteopetrosis by impairing the acidification of the
osteoclast resorption lacuna, which depends on Clcn7. Lange et al.
(2006) concluded that their finding that grey-lethal mice, just like
Clcn7-deficient mice, show lysosomal storage and neurodegeneration in
addition to osteopetrosis implies a more general importance for
Clcn7-Ostm1 complexes.

Graves et al. (2008) directly demonstrated an anion transport pathway in
lysosomes that has the defining characteristics of a CLC Cl(-)/H(+)
antiporter and showed that this transporter is the predominant route for
Cl(-) through the lysosomal membrane. Knockdown of Clc7 expression by
short interfering RNA could essentially ablate this lysosomal Cl(-)/H(+)
antiporter activity and could strongly diminish the ability of lysosomes
to acidify in vivo. Graves et al. (2008) concluded that CLC7 is a
Cl(-)/H(+) antiporter, that it constitutes the major Cl(-) permeability
of lysosomes, and that it is important in lysosomal acidification.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Based on the similarity between the phenotype of patients with infantile
malignant osteopetrosis (see OPTB4; 611490) and that of mice with
targeted disruption of the Clcn7 gene (see ANIMAL MODEL), which develop
severe osteopetrosis and retinal degeneration, Kornak et al. (2001)
searched for mutations in the human CLCN7 gene in 12 patients with
infantile osteopetrosis. They identified compound heterozygosity for a
nonsense (Q555X; 602727.0001) and a missense (R762Q; 602727.0002)
mutation in the CLCN7 gene in 1 patient with the disease who had early
visual impairment. No retinal histology was available.

Cleiren et al. (2001) reported 7 different mutations in the CLCN7 gene
(see, e.g., 602727.0004 and 602727.0005) among 12 families with
autosomal dominant osteopetrosis-2 (OPTA2; 166600) analyzed. Among these
families was the Danish family that Van Hul et al. (1997) initially
linked to chromosome 1p21. Additionally, 1 patient with the severe
autosomal recessive infantile form of osteopetrosis (OPTB4) was
identified as being homozygous for a CLCN7 mutation (602727.0003). The
authors hypothesized that OPTA2 reflects a dominant-negative effect,
since loss-of-function mutations in CLCN7 do not cause abnormalities in
heterozygous individuals.

ANIMAL MODEL

Kornak et al. (2001) observed that mice with targeted disruption of the
Clcn7 gene (Clcn7 -/-) had severe osteopetrosis and retinal
degeneration. Although osteoclasts were present in normal numbers, they
failed to resorb bone because they could not acidify the extracellular
resorption lacuna. Clcn7 was found to reside in late endosomal and
lysosomal compartments. In osteoclasts it was highly expressed in the
ruffled membrane, formed by the fusion of H(+) ATPase-containing
vesicles, that secretes protons into the lacuna. The authors concluded
that CLCN7 provides the chloride conductance required for an efficient
proton pumping by the H(+) ATPase of the osteoclast ruffled membrane.

Kasper et al. (2005) showed that Clcn7 knockout mice, in addition to
osteopetrosis, display neurodegeneration and severe lysosomal storage
disease despite unchanged lysosomal pH in cultured neurons. Rescuing
their bone phenotype by transgenic expression of Clcn7 in osteoclasts
moderately increased the life span and revealed a further progression of
the central nervous system pathology. Histologic analysis demonstrated
an accumulation of electron-dense material in neurons, autofluorescent
structures, microglial activation, and astrogliosis. As in human
neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (see 256730), there was a strong
accumulation of subunit c of the mitochondrial ATP synthase (see 603192)
and increased amounts of lysosomal enzymes. Such alterations were minor
or absent in Clcn3 (600580) knockout mice, despite a massive
neurodegeneration. Osteopetrotic oc/oc mice, lacking a functional
proton-ATPase a3 subunit (604592), showed no comparable retinal or
neuronal degeneration.

Weinert et al. (2010) generated mice carrying a point mutation
converting Clc7 into an uncoupled chloride conductor. Despite
maintaining lysosomal conductions and normal lysosomal pH, these
Clcn7(unc/unc) mice showed lysosomal storage disease like mice lacking
Clc7. However, their osteopetrosis was milder, and they lacked a coat
color phenotype. Weinert et al. (2010) concluded that only some roles of
ClC7 Cl-/H+ exchange can be taken over by a chloride conductance. This
conductance was even deleterious in Clcn7/unc heterozygote mice.
Clcn7-null and Clcn7(unc/unc) mice accumulated less chloride in
lysosomes than did wildtype mice. Weinert et al. (2010) concluded that
lowered lysosomal chloride may underlie their common phenotypes.

CLCN7, GLN555TER

In a patient with autosomal recessive infantile malignant osteopetrosis
(OPTB4; 611490), Kornak et al. (2001) identified compound heterozygosity
for a C-to-T transition at codon 555 of the CLCN7 gene, leading to
gln-to-ter substitution, and a G-to-A transition at nucleotide 2285,
leading to an arg762-to-gln substitution (602727.0002). The
arg762-to-gln substitution abolished a positive charge within the
conserved CBS2 domain of CCLN7. To investigate whether the mutations
affected protein expression, fibroblasts were analyzed by Western blot
analysis and immunofluorescence. In contrast to control cells, CLCN7
protein could not be detected in the fibroblasts from the patient.

al. (2001) identified homozygosity for a T-to-C transition at codon 766
of the CLCN7 gene, leading to a leu766-to-pro (L766P) substitution. The

which was not found in 100 control chromosomes.

dinucleotide deletion (del2423AG) in the C-terminal portion of CLCN7.
The mutation was predicted to generate a frameshift and result in
substitutions for the last 10 amino acids of the protein.

In a patient with malignant osteopetrosis (611490), an offspring of

determine which of the 3 genes associated with this entity was related
to this case. Only the CLCN7 gene was located in an autozygous region.
Mutation analysis of the CLCN7 gene showed that the proband was
homozygous for a novel missense mutation, ile261 to phe (I261F), arising
from a 781A-T transition in exon 9.

606648	TITLE *606648 INTERLEUKIN 22 RECEPTOR, ALPHA-2; IL22RA2
;;INTERLEUKIN 22-BINDING PROTEIN; IL22BP
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

IL22RA2 encodes a soluble class II cytokine receptor and naturally
occurring IL22 (605330) antagonist (Xu et al., 2001).

CLONING

By DNA database screening for sequences with homology to the
extracellular domain of IL10RB and analysis of 6q24 BAC clone, Dumoutier
et al. (2001) identified a cDNA encoding IL22BP, which they designated
CRF2X. Sequence analysis predicted that the 231-amino acid protein,
approximately 33% identical to the extracellular domains of IL20RA
(605620) and IL22R, contains a signal peptide, 4 cysteines conserved
among members of the class II cytokine receptor family, and 5 potential
N-linked glycosylation sites, but lacks a transmembrane domain. RT-PCR
analysis detected expression in breast, lungs, and intestinal tract,
with lower levels in skin, testis, brain, heart, and thymus. ELISA
showed that IL22BP does indeed bind IL22. Functional and luciferase
reporter analysis indicated that IL22BP specifically blocked
IL22-induced STAT3 (102582) activation in an intestinal epithelial cell
line.

Using similar methods, Kotenko et al. (2001) also cloned and
characterized IL22BP, which they initially designated CRF2-10. Western
blot analysis showed expression of a 34- to 35-kD glycosylated secreted
protein. Crosslinking and autoradiographic analysis confirmed the
interaction of IL22 and IL22BP. Functional analysis indicated that
IL22BP inhibited IL22-mediated MHC class I antigen expression. EMSA
analysis demonstrated inhibition of STAT1 (600555) and STAT3 DNA-binding
complexes. Northern blot analysis showed blocking of SOCS3 (604176)
expression.

Xu et al. (2001) obtained a cDNA encoding IL22BP, which they termed
IL22RA2. They noted the presence of 2 cytokine-binding fibronectin type
III domains. IL22RA2 effectively inhibited proliferation of a mouse
pre-B cell line in response to IL22. Northern blot analysis revealed
expression of 1.6- and 3.0-kb transcripts in placenta and spleen, but
not in other tissues. RT-PCR analysis extended the range of tissues
expressing IL22RA2 to skin and lung, with lower levels in heart,
pancreas, and prostate, as well as the digestive and female reproductive
systems. In situ hybridization analysis demonstrated expression in
monocytes, activated B cells, and epithelium. Xu et al. (2001) concluded
that IL22RA2 may be important as an IL22 antagonist in the regulation of
inflammatory responses.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence and RT-PCR analysis, Dumoutier et al. (2001),
Kotenko et al. (2001) and Xu et al. (2001) determined that the IL22BP
gene contains 6 exons. Xu et al. (2001) determined that the IL22BP gene
spans about 29 kb of genomic DNA.

GENE FUNCTION

Huber et al. (2012) described the crucial role of IL22BP in controlling
tumorigenesis and epithelial cell proliferation in the colon. IL22BP is
highly expressed by dendritic cells in the colon in steady-state
conditions. Sensing of intestinal tissue damage via the NLRP3 (606416)
or NLRP6 (609650) inflammasomes led to an IL18 (600953)-dependent
downregulation of IL22BP, thereby increasing the ratio of IL22/IL22BP.
IL22, which is induced during intestinal tissue damage, exerted
protective properties during the peak of damage, but promoted tumor
development if uncontrolled during the recovery phase. Thus, the
IL22-IL22BP axis critically regulates intestinal tissue repair and
tumorigenesis in the colon.

MAPPING

By BAC analysis, Dumoutier et al. (2001) and Kotenko et al. (2001)
mapped the IL22BP gene to chromosome 6q24.1-q25.2, in the vicinity of
IFNGR1, in a head-to-tail orientation. By radiation hybrid analysis, Xu
et al. (2001) localized the gene to chromosome 6q23.3-q24.2.

606628	TITLE *606628 GLYCINE N-METHYLTRANSFERASE; GNMT
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT; EC 2.1.1.20) catalyzes the synthesis
of N-methylglycine (sarcosine) from glycine using S-adenosylmethionine
(AdoMet) as the methyl donor. The enzyme was first described by
Blumenstein and Williams (1960) in guinea pig liver. GNMT acts as an
enzyme to regulate the ratio of S-adenosylmethionine to
S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy) and participates in the detoxification
pathway in liver cells.

CLONING

Chen et al. (1998) isolated a full-length GNMT cDNA, consisting of 1,096
nucleotides, from a liver cDNA library. This clone differed in 4
nucleotides from one isolated by Ogawa et al. (1993), with a resulting
change in 1 amino acid (residue 24 changed from glutamic acid to
aspartic acid).

Chen et al. (2000) isolated a human GNMT gene by screening a human
placenta genomic library with the cDNA isolated by Chen et al. (1998).
Northern blot analysis detected expression of the 1.8-kb GNMT mRNA only
in adult liver, pancreas, and prostate, and fetal liver.

GENE STRUCTURE

The human GNMT gene comprises 6 exons and spans 10 kb (Chen et al.,
2000).

GENE FUNCTION

Using a combination of high-throughput liquid and gas
chromatography-based mass spectrometry, Sreekumar et al. (2009) profiled
more than 1,126 metabolites across 262 clinical samples related to
prostate cancer (42 tissues and 110 each of urine and plasma). These
unbiased metabolomic profiles were able to distinguish benign prostate,
clinically localized prostate cancer, and metastatic disease. Sarcosine,
an N-methyl derivative of the amino acid glycine, was identified as a
differential metabolite that is highly increased during prostate cancer
progression to metastasis and can be detected noninvasively in urine.
Sarcosine levels were also increased in invasive prostate cancer cell
lines relative to benign prostate epithelial cells. Knockdown of
glycine-N-methyl transferase, the enzyme that generates sarcosine from
glycine, attenuated prostate cancer invasion. Addition of exogenous
sarcosine or knockdown of the enzyme that leads to sarcosine
degradation, sarcosine dehydrogenase (604455), induced an invasive
phenotype in benign prostate epithelial cells. Androgen receptor (AR;
313700) and the ERG gene fusion product (see 165080) coordinately
regulate components of the sarcosine pathway. Sreekumar et al. (2009)
concluded that by profiling the metabolomic alterations of prostate
cancer progression, they revealed sarcosine as a potentially important
metabolic intermediary of cancer cell invasion and aggressivity.

GLYCERALDEHYDE-3-PHOSPHATE DEHYDROGENASE, TESTIS-SPECIFIC;;
GAPD2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenases (EC 1.2.1.12), such as GAPDS,
are NAD-dependent enzymes that remove hydrogen and add phosphate to
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate to form 1,3-diphosphoglycerate (summary by
Welch et al., 2000).

CLONING

Using mouse Gapds to probe a testis cDNA library, Welch et al. (2000)
cloned human GAPDS, which they designated GAPD2. The deduced 408-amino
acid protein contains a 72-amino acid proline-rich N-terminal segment
not found in somatic cell GAPD (138400), and the remainder of the
molecule contains conserved residues that fold into the
substrate-binding site and NAD+ cofactor-binding pocket. GAPDS shares
83% amino acid identity with mouse Gapds and 68% identity with GAPD.
Northern blot analysis of several tissues detected a 1.5-kb GAPDS
transcript only in testis. Immunolocalization of GAPDS in fixed
permeabilized spermatozoa showed staining restricted to the principal
piece of the flagellum. By SDS-PAGE, GAPDS had an apparent molecular
mass of about 56 kD. GAPDS activity, purified from spermatozoa, resisted
detergent extraction with CHAPS and remained associated with relatively
insoluble components.

GENE STRUCTURE

Welch et al. (2000) determined that the GAPDS gene contains 11 exons.

MAPPING

By FISH, Welch et al. (2000) mapped the GAPDS gene to chromosome
19q13.1.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Several groups, including Myers et al. (2002), have reported linkage on
chromosome 12 in late-onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD; 104300) families.
To follow up on these results, Li et al. (2004) genotyped 282
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) under the linkage peak which
their group had previously identified, studying a multiple case-control
series totaling 1,089 AD subjects and 1,196 non-demented controls. A
strong association was observed in a small region chromosome 12 that
includes the GAPD gene (138400), which led them to examine this gene and
its paralogs on other chromosomes. These studies showed association with
2 other paralogs: GAPD2 on chromosome 19, and a GAPD pseudogene on
chromosome 12. A significant association between LOAD and a compound
genotype of 3 GAPD genes was observed in all 3 sample sets. Individually
these SNPs made differential contributions to disease risk in each of
the case-control series, suggesting that variants in functionally
similar genes may account for series-to-series heterogeneity of disease
risk. In general, the observations raised the possibility that the GAPD
genes are AD risk factors, a hypothesis that is consistent with the role
of GAPD in neuronal apoptosis.

ANIMAL MODEL

Miki et al. (2004) disrupted expression of the Gapds gene to selectively
block sperm glycolysis in mice. Gapds -/- males were infertile and had
profound defects in sperm motility, exhibiting sluggish movement without
forward progression. Although mitochondrial oxygen consumption was
unchanged, sperm from Gapds -/- mice had ATP levels that were only 10.4%
of those in sperm from wildtype mice. Miki et al. (2004) concluded that
most of the energy required for sperm motility is generated by
glycolysis rather than oxidative phosphorylation.

;;SINGLE AXON-RELATED 1; SINGAR1;;
RAP2-INTERACTING PROTEIN X; RIPX
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By randomly sequencing clones from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) obtained a cDNA encoding RUFY3, which they
called KIAA0871, encoding a deduced 469-amino acid protein.

Using 2-dimensional electrophoresis analysis of proteins in stage 2 and
stage 3 hippocampal neurons, Mori et al. (2007) identified RUFY3, which
they called single axon-related-1 (singar1), in human, mouse, and rat.
The deduced proteins in all 3 species have 469 amino acids and contain a
RUN domain. The mouse and rat proteins contain a splice variant,
designated singar2, of 487 amino acids. Expression of singar1 in rat
brain was relatively low on embryonic day 15, peaked around postnatal
day 4, and decreased in the adult brain. Immunocytochemical analysis
showed that rat singar1 and singar2 accumulate in growth cones of minor
processes and axons.

GENE FUNCTION

Mori et al. (2007) found that rat singar1 became upregulated during
polarization of cultured hippocampal neurons and remained at high levels
thereafter. Reduction of singar1 expression by RNAi led to an increase
in the population of neurons bearing surplus axons. Overexpression of
singar1 suppressed the formation of surplus axons induced by excess
amounts of shootin1 (611171), without affecting normal polarization
processes.

MAPPING

Scott (2007) mapped the RUFY3 gene to chromosome 4q13.3 based on an
alignment of the RUFY3 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AB020678) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.2).

;;Mi2-ALPHA
DESCRIPTION See CHD1 (602118) for a description of this gene family.

CLONING

Anti-Mi2 autoantibody is strongly associated with dermatomyositis and is
found in sera of 20% of dermatomyositis patients. Mi2 antigen consists
of at least 8 components. By immunoscreening human thymocyte and HeLa
cell cDNA expression libraries with anti-Mi2 patient sera, Ge et al.
(1995) isolated a partial cDNA encoding Mi2-alpha, or CHD3. The deduced
partial protein contains 4 potential zinc finger domains. Antibodies
against recombinant Mi2-alpha reacted with a 240-kD HeLa cell protein.
Northern blot analysis detected a single 7.5- to 8.0-kb Mi2-alpha
transcript in HeLa cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Seelig et al. (1996) noted that the Mi2-alpha and Mi2-beta (CHD4;
603277) proteins react with most or all dermatomyositis patient anti-Mi2
sera. While these proteins are distinct, they have stretches of
identical sequence that could result in shared epitopes.

Woodage et al. (1997) characterized the CHD3 gene. The predicted
1,944-amino acid protein shares 22.9% identity and 34.5% similarity
overall with the mouse Chd1 gene product.

MAPPING

Woodage et al. (1997) mapped the CHD3 gene to 17p13 by PCR screening of
the Genebridge 4 radiation hybrid mapping panel.

605368	TITLE *605368 BCL2/ADENOVIRUS E1B 19-KD PROTEIN-INTERACTING PROTEIN 3-LIKE; BNIP3L
;;NIX
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

In a large-scale sequencing effort of randomly selected cDNA clones,
Matsushima et al. (1998) identified BNIP3L as a homolog of the
previously identified proapoptotic protein BNIP3 (603293). Chen et al.
(1999) and Yasuda et al. (1999) also identified BNIP3L sequences in
database searches for sequences homologous to BNIP3. BNIP3L encodes a
deduced 219-amino acid protein that contains a predicted transmembrane
domain, PEST sequences, and a BH3 domain in the C-terminal region.
BNIP3L shares 56% amino acid sequence identity with BNIP3. Chen et al.
(1999) predicted that BNIP3L forms a homodimer because the observed
48-kD protein product is about double the 23.8-kD predicted mass. By
Northern blot analysis, Matsushima et al. (1998) detected a 1.45-kb
BNIP3L transcript in all tissues examined, and Yasuda et al. (1999)
detected 1.6- and 3.9-kb transcripts in all tissues examined but at
lower levels in liver, skeletal muscle, and pancreas.

GENE FUNCTION

Using indirect immunofluorescence analysis of an epitope-tagged BNIP3L,
Yasuda et al. (1999) localized BNIP3L to mitochondria. Chen et al.
(1999) colocalized BNIP3L with the 60-kD heat-shock protein-1 (HSPD1;
118190) known to be located primarily in mitochondria. The localization
of BNIP3L to the mitochondria is dependent on the putative transmembrane
domain.

Consistent with the presence of PEST sequences, which are associated
with proteins having high turnover rates whose degradation is controlled
by the proteasome, Chen et al. (1999) found that BNIP3L is progressively
degraded over 42 hours following transfection. This proteolytic
degradation is dependent on an active proteasome and is inhibited with
lactacystin, the proteasome threonine protease inhibitor.

Matsushima et al. (1998) used colony formation assays to demonstrate
that transient overexpression of BNIP3L caused a suppression of cancer
cell growth. Chen et al. (1999) noted that this growth suppression can
be accounted for by the proapoptotic function proposed for BNIP3L.
Yasuda et al. (1999) and Chen et al. (1999) observed that BNIP3L
transfection induces apoptosis. Chen et al. (1999) demonstrated that
removal of the transmembrane domain prevents the cell death induction.
Additionally, BNIP3L expression can overcome the effect of the
antiapoptotic BCL2 (151430) and BCL2L1 (600039) in transfected cells.

Yasuda et al. (1999) showed that in vitro translated BNIP3L binds
specifically and directly with GST fusion proteins of various BCL2
family antiapoptosis proteins including BCL2, BCL2L1, and adenovirus E1B
19-kD. Cotransfection of BNIP3L significantly reduced the antiapoptotic
activity of E1B 19-kD and BCL2L1, leading Yasuda et al. (1999) to
suggest that, like BNIP3, BNIP3L may antagonize the activity of BCL2
family antiapoptosis proteins.

MAPPING

By FISH, Matsushima et al. (1998) mapped the BNIP3L gene to 8p21. The
authors noted that this region shows frequent loss of heterozygosity in
carcinomas of the colon, prostate, liver, and lung.

ANIMAL MODEL

Sandoval et al. (2008) generated mice deficient in Nix1 by targeted
disruption. Nix-null mice developed anemia with reduced mature
erythrocytes and compensatory expansion of erythroid precursors.
Erythrocytes in the peripheral blood of Nix-null mice exhibited
mitochondrial retention and reduced life span in vivo. Although the
clearance of ribosomes proceeded normally in the absence of Nix, the
entry of mitochondria into autophagosomes for clearance was defective.
Deficiency in Nix inhibited the loss of mitochondrial membrane
potential, and treatment with uncoupling chemicals or a BH3 mimetic
induced the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and restored the
sequestration of mitochondria into autophagosomes in Nix-null erythroid
cells. Sandoval et al. (2008) concluded that Nix-dependent loss of
mitochondrial membrane potential is important for targeting the
mitochondria into autophagesomes for clearance during erythroid
maturation, and interference with this function impairs erythroid
maturation and results in anemia.

607207	TITLE *607207 STIP1 HOMOLOGOUS AND U BOX-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1; STUB1
;;C TERMINUS OF HSC70-INTERACTING PROTEIN; CHIP
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

STUB1, or CHIP, is a ubiquitin ligase/cochaperone that participates in
protein quality control by targeting a broad range of chaperone protein
substrates for degradation (Min et al., 2008).

CLONING

In a search for tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR)-containing proteins,
Ballinger et al. (1999) isolated a cDNA encoding STUB1, which they
termed CHIP, from a heart cDNA library. The deduced 303-amino acid
protein has a molecular mass of 35 kD and contains three 34-amino acid
TPR domains at its N terminus, a central domain rich in charged
residues, and 2 potential nuclear localization signals. The N terminus
shares similarity with several TPR-containing proteins, particularly
those that interact with members of the heat-shock protein family. Human
CHIP shares 97% and 53% amino acid identity with its mouse and
Drosophila homologs, respectively, with the highest conservation in the
94 residues of the C terminus. Northern blot analysis detected a 1.3-kb
transcript at highest levels in striated muscle (heart and skeletal
muscle), with lower expression in pancreas and brain, and relatively
little expression in lung, liver, placenta, and kidney. Expression of
CHIP was readily detected in most cell lines and primary culture cells
tested, the exceptions being cells of hematopoietic origin and
undifferentiated neuronal cells. Transient transfection experiments in
COS-7 cells localized CHIP expression to the cytoplasm.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen, Ballinger et al. (1999) identified HSC70
(600816) and HSP70 (140550) as potential interaction partners for CHIP.
In vitro binding assays demonstrated direct interactions between CHIP
and both HSC70 and HSP70, and complexes containing CHIP and HSC70 were
identified in immunoprecipitates of human skeletal muscle cells in vivo.
CHIP interacted with the C-terminal residues 540 to 650 of HSC70,
whereas HSC70 interacted with the N-terminal residues 1 to 197 of CHIP,
which contain the TPR domain and the adjacent charged domain.
Recombinant CHIP inhibited HSP40 (see 604572)-stimulated ATPase activity
of HSC70 and HSP70, suggesting that CHIP blocks the forward reaction of
the HSC70-HSP70 substrate-binding cycle. Both luciferase refolding and
substrate binding in the presence of HSP40 and HSP70 were inhibited by
CHIP. These results indicated that CHIP decreases net ATPase activity
and reduces chaperone efficiency, and they implicated CHIP in the
negative regulation of the forward reaction of the HSC70-HSP70
substrate-binding cycle.

Using an in vitro ubiquitylation assay with recombinant proteins, Jiang
et al. (2001) demonstrated that CHIP possesses intrinsic E3 ubiquitin
ligase activity and promotes ubiquitylation. This activity was dependent
on the C-terminal U box, a domain that shares similarity with yeast UFD2
(603753). CHIP interacted functionally and physically with the
stress-responsive ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme family UBCH5 (602961). A
major target of the ubiquitin ligase activity of CHIP was HSC70 itself.
CHIP ubiquitylated HSC70, primarily with short, noncanonical
multiubiquitin chains, but had no appreciable effect on steady-state
levels or half-life of this protein. The authors concluded that CHIP is
a bona fide ubiquitin ligase and suggested that U box-containing
proteins may constitute a novel family of E3s.

Unfolded PAELR (602583) is a substrate of the E3 ubiquitin ligase parkin
(602544). Accumulation of PAELR in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of
dopaminergic neurons induces ER stress leading to neurodegeneration.
Imai et al. (2002) showed that CHIP, HSP70, parkin, and PAELR formed a
complex in vitro and in vivo. The amount of CHIP in the complex
increased during ER stress. CHIP promoted the dissociation of HSP70 from
parkin and PAELR, thus facilitating parkin-mediated PAELR
ubiquitination. Moreover, CHIP enhanced parkin-mediated in vitro
ubiquitination of PAELR in the absence of HSP70. CHIP also enhanced the
ability of parkin to inhibit cell death induced by PAELR. The authors
concluded that CHIP is therefore a mammalian E4-like molecule that
positively regulates parkin E3 activity.

Kampinga et al. (2003) found that overexpression of Chip in hamster
fibroblasts increased the refolding of proteins after thermal
denaturation. Inhibition of Hsp70 abolished the effect of Chip on
protein folding. Hsp40 competitively inhibited Chip-dependent refolding,
suggesting that Chip and Hsp40 have opposing effects on Hsp70 ATPase
activity. Consistent with this, Chip overexpression did not alter
protein folding following ATP depletion, when Hsp70 is in the ADP-bound
state. Kampinga et al. (2003) concluded that CHIP attenuates the HSP70
ATPase cycle.

Alberti et al. (2004) found that epitope-tagged HSPBP1 (612939)
immunoprecipitated HSC70 and CHIP from HeLa cell lysates. In the absence
of HSC70, HSPBP1 and CHIP bound each other with low affinity. In the
presence of ubiquitin-activating and -conjugating enzymes, CHIP mediated
ubiquitination of test proteins when bound to HSC70. Addition of HSPBP1
inhibited CHIP-mediated ubiquitination of test proteins as well as
CHIP-mediated ubiquitination of HSC70. Complex formation between HSPBP1,
HSC70, and CHIP was necessary for HSPBP1 to inhibit CHIP. Alberti et al.
(2004) concluded that HSPBP1 regulates CHIP ubiquitin ligase activity.

Shin et al. (2005) identified CHIP as a component of Lewy bodies in
human brain, where it colocalized with alpha-synuclein (SNCA; 163890)
and HSP70. In a human neuroglioma cell line, endogenous CHIP colocalized
with alpha-synuclein and HSP70 in intracellular inclusions, and CHIP
immunoprecipitated with alpha-synuclein, synphilin-1 (SNCAIP; 603779),
and HSP70. Overexpression of CHIP reduced alpha-synuclein protein levels
and inclusion formation. CHIP mediated alpha-synuclein degradation by
both the proteasome and lysosome pathways. Mutation analysis revealed
that the TRP domain of CHIP directed alpha-synuclein toward the
proteasome, whereas the U-box domain of CHIP directed alpha-synuclein
toward the lysosome. Shin et al. (2005) concluded that CHIP acts as a
molecular switch for the degradation of misfolded proteins via the
proteasome and lysosome pathways.

Qian et al. (2006) demonstrated that CHIP not only enhances HSP70
induction during acute stress, but also mediates its turnover during the
stress recovery process. Central to this dual phase regulation is its
substrate dependence: CHIP preferentially ubiquitinates chaperone-bound
substrates, whereas degradation of HSP70 by CHIP-dependent targeting to
the ubiquitin-proteasome system occurs when misfolded substrates have
been depleted. Qian et al. (2006) concluded that the sequential analysis
of the CHIP-associated chaperone adaptor and its bound substrate
provides an elegant mechanism for maintaining homeostasis by tuning
chaperone levels appropriately to reflect the status of protein building
within the cytoplasm.

Cystic fibrosis (219700) arises from misfolding and premature
degradation of CFTR (602421) containing a deletion of phe508 (delF508;
602421.0001). Younger et al. (2006) identified an endoplasmic reticulum
(ER) membrane-associated ubiquitin ligase complex containing the E3 RMA1
(RNF5; 602677), the E2 UBC6E (UBE2J1), and derlin-1 (DERL1; 608813) that
cooperated with the cytosolic HSC70/CHIP E3 complex to triage CFTR and
delFl508. Derlin-1 retained CFTR in the ER membrane and interacted with
RMA1 and UBC6E to promote proteasomal degradation of CFTR. RMA1 could
recognize folding defects in delF508 coincident with translation,
whereas CHIP appeared to act posttranslationally. A folding defect in
delF508 detected by RMA1 involved the inability of the second
membrane-spanning domain of CFTR to productively interact with
N-terminal domains. Younger et al. (2006) concluded that the RMA1 and
CHIP E3 ubiquitin ligases act sequentially in ER membrane and cytosol to
monitor the folding status of CFTR and delF508.

Base excision repair (BER) is the major pathway for processing simple
lesions in DNA and involves a stable complex of the scaffold protein
XRCC1 (194360), DNA polymerase-beta (POLB; 174760), and DNA ligase
III-alpha (LIG3; 600940). Cellular levels of these enzymes must be
tightly regulated, because increased amounts of BER enzymes lead to
elevated mutagenesis and genetic instability. Parsons et al. (2008)
showed that BER proteins not involved in a repair complex were
ubiquitinated by CHIP and subsequently degraded by the proteasome in
HeLa cells. Overexpression of CHIP reduced the levels of both endogenous
and transfected POLB and XRCC1 by about 3-fold compared with control
cells. Conversely, reduction in CHIP protein levels by RNA interference
increased the levels of POLB, XRCC1, and LIG3. CHIP-mediated control of
BER proteins did not require interaction of CHIP with heat-shock
proteins. Parsons et al. (2008) concluded that CHIP controls the
cellular level of BER enzymes and, correspondingly, the efficiency and
capacity of BER.

Okiyoneda et al. (2010) identified the components of the peripheral
protein quality control network that removes unfolded CFTR containing
the F508del mutation (602421.0001) from the plasma membrane. Based on
their results and proteostatic mechanisms at different subcellular
locations, Okiyoneda et al. (2010) proposed a model in which the
recognition of unfolded cytoplasmic regions of CFTR is mediated by HSC70
(600816) in concert with DNAJA1 (602837) and possibly by the HSP90
machinery (140571). Prolonged interaction with the chaperone-cochaperone
complex recruits CHIP-UBCH5C (602963) and leads to ubiquitination of
conformationally damaged CFTR. This ubiquitination is probably
influenced by other E3 ligases and deubiquitinating enzyme activities,
culminating in accelerated endocytosis and lysosomal delivery mediated
by Ub-binding clathrin adaptors and the endosomal sorting complex
required for transport (ESCRT) machinery, respectively. In an
accompanying perspective, Hutt and Balch (2010) commented that the
'yin-yang' balance maintained by the proteostasis network is critical
for normal cellular, tissue, and organismal physiology.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the STUB1
gene to chromosome 16 (TMAP RH15604).

ANIMAL MODEL

Min et al. (2008) found that Chip -/- mice exhibited increased perinatal
lethality compared with wildtype mice, likely due to impaired adaptation
to the stress of parturition. Both male and female Chip -/- mice were
smaller than controls, and the difference became more obvious as the
mice aged. Chip -/- mice, particularly males, showed significantly
reduced longevity. The median survival time for both male and female
wildtype mice was 25 months, whereas it was only 7.8 and 11.2 months for
Chip -/- males and females, respectively. Chip deficiency led to
accelerated age-related pathophysiologic changes that were accompanied
by accelerated cellular senescence, increased oxidative stress,
deregulation of protein quality control, and reduced proteasome
activity. Min et al. (2008) concluded that impaired protein quality
control contributes to cellular senescence and that CHIP-dependent
quality control influences longevity.

609134	TITLE *609134 UBIQUITIN-PROTEIN LIGASE E3 COMPONENT N-RECOGNIN 2; UBR2
;;CHROMOSOME 6 OPEN READING FRAME 133; C6ORF133;;
KIAA0349
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Proteolysis by the ubiquitin-proteasome system controls the
concentration of many regulatory proteins. The selectivity of
ubiquitylation is determined by ubiquitin E3 ligases, which recognize
the substrate's destabilization signal, or degron. The E3 ligase UBR2
participates in the N-end rule pathway, which targets proteins bearing
an N-terminal degron, or N-degron (Kwon et al., 2003).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1997) cloned UBR2, which they designated
KIAA0349. The deduced 1,275-amino acid protein shares 19.9% identity
over 710 amino acids with an S. cerevisiae N-end-recognizing protein.
RT-PCR of several tissues detected UBR2 expression only in testis.

Kwon et al. (2003) cloned mouse Ubr2. The deduced protein has a
calculated molecular mass of about 200 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

Kwon et al. (2003) determined that mouse Ubr2 bound to type-1 (arg) and
type-2 (leu or phe) destabilizing N-terminal residues of a test
substrate or a 12-residue peptide. It did not bind to stabilizing (met
or gly), secondary destabilizing (asp), or type-3 destabilizing (ser,
thr, or ala) residues.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kwon et al. (2003) determined that the mouse Ubr2 gene contains 48 exons
and spans about 98 kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1997) mapped the UBR2 gene
to chromosome 6. Using radiation hybrid analysis and FISH, Kwon et al.
(2003) mapped the UBR2 gene to chromosome 6p21-p11 and the mouse Ubr2
gene to the middle of chromosome 17.

ANIMAL MODEL

Kwon et al. (2003) found that Ubr2 knockout in mice was embryonic lethal
depending on both the gender and genetic background. In an inbred
strain, the Ubr2 -/- genotype was lethal to most embryos of either
gender. In a mixed background, most Ubr2 -/- females died as embryos and
Ubr2 -/- males were viable but infertile due to postnatal degeneration
of the testes. The gross architecture of Ubr2 -/- testes was normal and
spermatogonia were intact, but spermatocytes were arrested between
leptotene/zygotene and pachytene, and died through apoptosis. A
conspicuous defect of Ubr2 -/- spermatocytes was the absence of intact
synaptonemal complexes. Ubr2 +/- heterozygotes were produced at
approximately mendelian frequency and were phenotypically normal except
for reduced fertility compared with wildtype mice.

142858	TITLE *142858 MAJOR HISTOCOMPATIBILITY COMPLEX, CLASS II, DP BETA-1; HLA-DPB1
;;HLA-DP HISTOCOMPATIBILITY TYPE, BETA-1 SUBUNIT
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The DP (formerly SB) subregion of the HLA class II D region contains
genes encoding the alpha (142880) and beta chains of a heterodimeric,
cell-surface glycoprotein that presents antigens to CD4+ (helper) T
lymphocytes. Because the HLA class II molecules are highly polymorphic,
they can embrace a wide variety of antigens in their antigen-binding
groove and present them to diverse T-lymphocyte antigen receptors,
triggering antigen recognition. Amino acids located at key positions
along the alpha-helical portions of these HLA heterodimers dictate which
peptide antigens can bind. Even single amino acid substitutions in these
regions may alter the shape of HLA-peptide binding pocket sufficiently
to change its specificity.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Chronic beryllium disease (CBD) is a hypersensitivity lung disorder
caused by exposure to beryllium that is not strictly dependent on
beryllium concentration. CBD is a disorder that occurs in diverse
industries, including high-technology ceramics, electronics, dental
alloy preparation, nuclear weapons, metal extraction, and aerospace.
Only a subset of exposed workers develop the disease. Its
immunopathologic features predict that CBD is maintained by an
accumulation of large numbers of beryllium-specific CD4+ T cells in the
lungs of patients. Granulomas form around beryllium particles in the
walls of the alveoli. Blood lymphocytes from a person sensitive to
beryllium proliferate in vitro when cultured in the presence of
beryllium salts. This reaction is the basis of the beryllium lymphocyte
proliferation test that is used in the specific diagnosis of CBD and for
detection of early CBD in industrial screening programs. Richeldi et al.
(1993) demonstrated that a glutamic acid residue at position 69 of the
HLA-DPB1 polypeptide confers susceptibility to CBD. In an evaluation of
MHC class II genes in 33 CBD cases and 44 beryllium-exposed unaffected
controls, they found that 97% of the CBD cases expressed the form with
glutamic acid at residue 69, whereas only 30% of an unaffected
population showed that residue rather than the positively charged
lysine. The situation has a parallel to ankylosis spondylitis in which
about 90% of persons with the disorder are positive for HLA-B27 but only
2% of HLA-B27-positive persons in the general population develop the
disorder. The genetic connection raises ethical and societal issues
concerning genetic screening in the workplace.

Taylor et al. (1995) obtained preliminary evidence in a small series of
patients suggesting that susceptibility to childhood common acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) was associated with an allele at the
HLA-DPB1 locus, DPB1*0201. Taylor et al. (2002) tested this hypothesis
by comparing the frequency of children with leukemia (n = 982) who typed
for specific DPB1 alleles and 2 groups of non-leukemic children (1 with
solid tumors, excluding lymphomas, and a group of normal infants). The
authors found that significantly more children with common ALL and
T-cell ALL (but not progenitor B-cell ALL or acute non-lymphocytic ALL)
typed for DPB1*0201, as compared with children with solid tumors (odds
ratio, 95% CI for common ALL: 1.76, 1.20-2.56; T-cell ALL: 1.93,
1.01-3.80) and normal infants (odds ratio, 95% CI for common ALL: 1.83,
1.34-2.48; T-cell ALL: 2.00, 1.10-3.82). In childhood common ALL,
significantly more children than those with solid tumors or normal
infants typed for DPB1 alleles coding specific polymorphic amino acids
lining the antigen-binding site of the DPB1*0201 allotypic protein. The
authors suggested that susceptibility to childhood common ALL may be
influenced by DPB ABS amino acid polymorphisms shared by DPB1*0201 and
other DPB1 allotypes, which activate T-helper cells responsible for
proliferation of preleukemic cells.

In a study of patients with sarcoidosis (181000) and case-matched
controls, Rossman et al. (2003) found that the HLA-DPB1 locus
contributed to susceptibility for sarcoidosis but, in contrast to
chronic beryllium disease, a non-glu69-containing allele, HLA-DPB1*0101,
conveyed most of the risk.

For a discussion of a possible association between variation in the DPB1
gene and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) without
deep vein thrombosis, see 612862.

Kamatani et al. (2009) performed a 2-stage genomewide association study
using 786 Japanese chronic hepatitis B (see 610424) cases and 2,201
controls, and identified a significant association of chronic hepatitis
B with 11 SNPs in a region including HLA-DPA1 (142880) and HLA-DPB1.
Kamatani et al. (2009) validated these associations by genotyping 2 SNPs
from the region in 3 additional Japanese and Thai cohorts consisting of
1,300 cases and 2,100 controls (combined P = 6.34 x 10(-39) and 2.31 x
10(-38), odds ratio = 0.57 and 0.56, respectively). Subsequent analyses
revealed risk haplotypes (HLA-DPA1*0202-DPB1*0501 and
HLA-DPA1*0202-DPB1*0301, odds ratio = 1.45 and 2.31, respectively) and
protective haplotypes (HLA-DPA1*0103-DPB1*0402 and
HLA-DPA1*0103-DPB1*0401, odds ratio = 0.52 and 0.57, respectively).
Kamatani et al. (2009) concluded that genetic variants in the HLA-DP
locus are strongly associated with risk of persistent infection with
hepatitis B virus in Asians.

EVOLUTION

The coding regions of many of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC)
molecules are believed to be subject to balancing selection. To
determine whether the regulatory regions of such coding sequences are
also subject to the same type of selection, Liu et al. (2006) studied
the polymorphism of the regulatory regions of the HLA-DPA1 (142880) and
HLA-DPB1 genes among ethnic minorities in southwestern China.
Phylogenetic analysis revealed 2 deep clades more than 10 million years
old. There was almost complete linkage disequilibrium between the
regulatory and coding regions of HLA-DPA1, which hints at coadaptive
balancing selection on the entire region. Thus, the molecular mechanism
of balancing selection in MHC may involve expression modulation in
addition to coding region polymorphisms. Although the frequency of clade
II is more than 30% in some ethnic minorities, it decreases to less than
5% among southern Han Chinese and vanishes among Europeans. As
suspected, some ancient balanced polymorphisms, lost in major
populations, still exist in isolated ethnicities. These isolated
polymorphisms may thus contribute disproportionately to the total
diversity of modern humans.

HISTORY

Roux-Dosseto et al. (1983) isolated a class II antigen beta-chain cDNA
clone from a human B-cell cDNA library by using the mouse I-A(beta) gene
as a probe. It was shown to be distinct from DC-beta- and
DR-beta-related loci by DNA sequence analysis, and corresponded to SB
beta in all characteristics.

Richeldi et al. (1993) demonstrated that the HLA-DPB1 polypeptide had
glutamic acid at residue 69 in 97% of cases of chronic beryllium disease
but only 30% of an unaffected population.

Fontenot et al. (2000) isolated beryllium-specific T-cell lines from the
lungs of patients with chronic beryllium disease. These CD4+ T-cell
lines specifically responded to beryllium in culture in the presence of
antigen-presenting cells that expressed class II MHC molecules HLA-DR,
-DQ, and -DP. The response to beryllium was nearly completely and
selectively blocked by monoclonal antibody to HLA-DP. Additional studies
showed that only certain HLA-DP alleles allowed presentation of
beryllium. Overall, the DP alleles that presented beryllium to
disease-specific T-cell lines matched those implicated in disease
susceptibility, providing a mechanism for this association.

609091	TITLE *609091 F-BOX ONLY PROTEIN 9; FBXO9
;;FBX9;;
NY-REN-57
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the F-box protein family, such as FBXO9, are characterized by
an approximately 40-amino acid F-box motif. SCF complexes, formed by
SKP1 (601434), cullin (see CUL1; 603134), and F-box proteins, act as
protein-ubiquitin ligases. F-box proteins interact with SKP1 through the
F box, and they interact with ubiquitination targets through other
protein interaction domains (Jin et al., 2004).

CLONING

Using SKP1 as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen and by searching DNA
databases, Cenciarelli et al. (1999) identified several genes encoding
F-box proteins, including FBX9. The N-terminal half of FBX9 contains a
leucine zipper, followed by an F box.

Jin et al. (2004) reported that the FBXO9 protein contains an N-terminal
tetratricopeptide repeat, a central F box, and a C-terminal HNH nuclease
family domain.

MAPPING

Jin et al. (2004) stated that the FBXO9 gene maps to chromosome
6p12.3-p11.2 and the mouse Fbxo9 gene maps to chromosome 9E1.0.

IFT43 is a subunit of intraflagellar transport complex A (IFTA). IFTA is
involved in retrograde ciliary transport along axonemal microtubules
(summary by Arts et al., 2011).

CLONING

Arts et al. (2011) reported that alternative splicing of human IFT43
produces 2 major protein isoforms. The 2 isoforms contain 213 and 208
amino acids and differ only in a central region.

GENE STRUCTURE

Arts et al. (2011) reported that the IFT43 gene contains 10 exons.

MAPPING

Gross (2011) mapped the IFT43 gene to chromosome 14q24.3 based on an
alignment of the IFT43 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC010436) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a brother and sister from a consanguineous family of Moroccan descent
with cranioectodermal dysplasia mapping to chromosome 14 (CED3; 614099),
Arts et al. (2011) analyzed 2 candidate genes and identified
homozygosity for a missense mutation in the translation initiation codon
of the IFT43 gene (M1V; 614068.0001). Analysis of fibroblasts from 1 of
the sibs and from a previously studied patient (Gilissen et al., 2010)
with CED2 (613610) and mutations in WDR35 (613602) showed similar
ciliary defects, with accumulation of IFTB-complex proteins in the
distal part of the ciliary axoneme and in the ciliary tip, whereas in
the cilia of control fibroblasts, those proteins were less abundant and
primarily located at the basal body and transition zone. Cilia in mutant
IFT43 fibroblasts were also somewhat shorter than those of control
fibroblasts, as had been previously reported (Walczak-Sztulpa et al.,
2010) in patients with CED1 (218330) and mutations in IFT122 (606045).
Arts et al. (2011) concluded that CED results from defects in retrograde
intraflagellar transport due to disruption of the IFTA protein complex.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CRANIOECTODERMAL DYSPLASIA 3
IFT43, MET1VAL

In an affected brother and sister from a consanguineous family of
Moroccan descent with cranioectodermal dysplasia-3 (CED3; 614099), Arts
et al. (2011) identified homozygosity for a 1A-G transition at the
translation initiation codon of the IFT43 gene, resulting in a
met1-to-val (M1V) substitution. The unaffected first-cousin parents were
heterozygous for the mutation, which was not found in 192 Dutch or 122
Moroccan control alleles. Western blot analysis revealed that the mutant
IFT43 protein had a molecular mass that was approximately 3 kD lower
than wildtype, consistent with translation initiation in exon 2, at the
next available ATG initiation codon of the coding sequence, resulting in
an N-terminal deletion of 21 amino acids in the same open reading frame.
Patient fibroblasts showed accumulation of IFTB complex proteins in the
distal part of the ciliary axoneme and in the ciliary tip, whereas in
the cilia of control fibroblasts, those proteins were less abundant and
primarily located at the basal body and transition zone; the mutant
cilia were also somewhat shorter than those of controls.

601758	TITLE *601758 PEROXISOME BIOGENESIS FACTOR 12; PEX12
;;PEROXIN 12
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Chang et al. (1997) identified a human ortholog of yeast PEX12 by
screening the public database of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) for
cDNAs encoding a protein similar to the yeast PEX12 protein. The human
gene encodes a predicted 359-amino acid protein with a molecular mass of
approximately 40 kD. Although its sequence similarity to yeast PEX12 is
limited, the human PEX12 protein is also an integral peroxisomal
membrane protein. Like the yeast protein, human peroxin-12 has 2
membrane-spanning domains and a C3HC4 zinc-binding motif extending out
into the cytosol. This ring-finger domain is essential for the function
of PEX12 (Kalish et al., 1996).

Okumoto and Fujiki (1997) independently cloned a human PEX12 cDNA.
Okumoto et al. (1998) determined that the PEX12 protein exposes both N-
and C-terminal regions to the cytosol.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Chang et al. (1997) found that PEX12 expression restored peroxisomal
protein import in fibroblasts from PBD patients of complementation group
3 (CG3), and they identified frameshift mutations in PEX12 in 2
unrelated CG3 patients (e.g., 601758.0001).

Okumoto and Fujiki (1997) identified a homozygous nonsense mutation in
the PEX12 gene (601758.0004) resulting in PEX12 deficiency.

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

Chang and Gould (1998) demonstrated that all patients from
complementation group 3 of the peroxisome biogenesis disorder carry
mutations in PEX12. A comparison between PEX12 genotypes and the
clinical and cellular phenotypes of the corresponding PBD patients
suggested a relatively straightforward relationship between genotype and
phenotype in this group of the PBDs, such that the loss of PEX12
function leads to more severe cellular and clinical phenotypes.

Gootjes et al. (2004) reported 5 PBD patients with mutations in the
PEX12 gene. Four patients with a severe phenotype had mutations that
disrupted the protein and eliminated at least the last zinc-binding
domain. One patient with a milder phenotype had an allele that was
capable of producing a protein with the zinc-binding domain (see
601758.0009).

Gootjes et al. (2004) reported the biochemical characteristics and
molecular basis of a subset of atypical PBD patients. These patients
were characterized by abnormal peroxisomal plasma metabolites, but
otherwise normal to very mildly abnormal peroxisomal parameters in
cultured skin fibroblasts, including a mosaic catalase
immunofluorescence pattern in fibroblasts. Since the latter feature made
standard complementation analysis impossible, the authors used a novel
complementation technique in which fibroblasts were cultured at 40
degrees Celsius, which exacerbates the defect in peroxisome biogenesis.
Using this method, they assigned 8 patients to complementation group 3,
followed by identification of a single homozygous mutation in the PEX12
gene (601758.0006).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
PEROXISOMAL BIOGENESIS DISORDER 3A (ZELLWEGER)
PEX12, 4-BP INS, 733GCCT

In fibroblasts from a patient with peroxisome biogenesis disorder of
complementation group 3 (PBD3A; 614859), Chang et al. (1997) identified
compound heterozygosity for a 4-bp insertion after nucleotide 733 of the
PEX12 gene and a single T insertion after nucleotide 744 (601758.0002).
The 4-bp insertion creates a new Cac8I restriction site.

.0002
PEROXISOMAL BIOGENESIS DISORDER 3A (ZELLWEGER)
PEX12, 1-BP INS, 744T

See 601758.0001 and Chang et al. (1997). This insertion eliminates an
AccI restriction site in the PEX12 gene.

.0003
PEROXISOMAL BIOGENESIS DISORDER 3A (ZELLWEGER)
PEX12, 4-BP DEL, 684TAGT

In a patient with peroxisome biogenesis disorder of complementation
group 3 (PBD3A; 614859), Chang et al. (1997) identified a 4-bp
frameshift mutation in the PEX12 gene. No other PEX12 allele was
identified in this patient.

.0004
PEROXISOMAL BIOGENESIS DISORDER 3A (ZELLWEGER)
PEX12, LYS231TER

In a patient with peroxisome biogenesis disorder of complementation
group 3 (PBD3A; 614859), Okumoto and Fujiki (1997) identified
homozygosity for an A-to-T transversion in the PEX12 gene, resulting in
a termination codon being substituted for lysine at codon 231.
Transfection of the patient's PEX12 into a PEX12-deficient cell line did
not restore peroxisomes.

.0005
PEROXISOMAL BIOGENESIS DISORDER 3A (ZELLWEGER)
PEROXISOMAL BIOGENESIS DISORDER 3B, INCLUDED
PEX12, ARG180TER

In a patient with peroxisome biogenesis disorder of complementation
group 3 (PBD3A; 614859), Okumoto et al. (1998) identified homozygosity
for a 538C-T transition in the PEX12 gene, changing arginine at 180 to a
termination codon (R180X).

Gootjes et al. (2004) found this mutation in compound heterozygosity
with a missense mutation (L317F; 601758.0010) in a patient with a mild
form of peroxisome biogenesis disorder of complementation group 3
(PBD3B; 266510).

.0006
PEROXISOMAL BIOGENESIS DISORDER 3B
PEX12, SER320PHE

Gootjes et al. (2004) identified a 959C-T transition in the PEX12 gene,
resulting in a ser320-to-phe (S320F) substitution, in 8 PBD patients
with atypical features (PBD3B; 266510). The PEX12-S320F patients
displayed a relatively mild phenotype compared with the whole PBD
spectrum. When compared to mild PEX1-G843D patients (602136.0001), as
described by Preuss et al. (2002), they displayed fewer dysmorphic
features and ocular abnormalities, although their cerebral and liver
abnormalities were similar.

.0007
PEROXISOMAL BIOGENESIS DISORDER 3B
PEX12, 2-BP DEL, 26CA

In a patient with a mild form of peroxisome biogenesis disorder of
complementation group 3 (PBD3B; 266510), Chang and Gould (1998)
identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the PEX12 gene: a
2-bp deletion (26delCA) early in the coding region and a splice site
mutation (601758.0008). PEX12 mRNA present in the patient's cells was
derived from only the allele with the 2-bp deletion. The deduced protein
product of this mRNA would contain only the first 8 amino acids of the
protein, but functional expression studies showed that the mutant PEX12
protein retained significant residual activity, approximately
one-seventh that of the wildtype protein. Further analysis showed that
the 2-bp mutation resulted in the synthesis of a 29-kD PEX12 protein in
vitro, consistent with translation initiation at a downstream internal
AUG codon. The authors noted that translation initiation at internal AUG
codons may modulate disease phenotypes and should be considered when
unexpectedly mild phenotypes result from predicated 'severe' mutations
early in the coding region.

PEROXISOMAL BIOGENESIS DISORDER 3B
PEX12, ARG91SER

In a patient with a mild form of peroxisome biogenesis disorder of
complementation group 3 (PBD3B; 266510), Gootjes et al. (2004)
identified a homozygous 273A-T transversion in the PEX12 gene, resulting
in an arg91-to-ser (R91S) substitution in the N terminus. The levels of
PEX12 mRNA were relatively normal. Biochemical studies showed that the
patient's cells had normal levels of dihydroxyacetonephosphate
acyltransferase (DHAPAT) activity. The missense mutation, compared to
frameshift or nonsense mutations, is predicted to result in a
full-length protein that retains the transmembrane domains and the
zinc-binding domain. Gootjes et al. (2004) noted the genotype/phenotype
correlation between a milder phenotype and the residual protein
activity.

.0010
PEROXISOMAL BIOGENESIS DISORDER 3B
PEX12, LEU317PHE

In a patient with a mild form of peroxisome biogenesis disorder of
complementation group 3 (PBD3B; 266510), Gootjes et al. (2004)
identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the PEX12 gene: a
949C-T transition, resulting in a leu317-to-phe (L317F) substitution in
the zinc-binding domain of the protein, and an R180X (601758.0005)
substitution. Although biochemical analyses of the patient's plasma
suggested the presence of a peroxisomal disorder, studies of the
patient's fibroblasts were normal, suggesting that the defect was
organ-specific. Christensen et al. (1990) had previously diagnosed the
patient with a deficiency of trihydroxycholestanoyl-CoA oxidase, which
Gootjes et al. (2004) excluded as a distinct disease entity.

609935	TITLE *609935 EARLY B-CELL FACTOR 4; EBF4
;;KIAA1442
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

EBF4 belongs to the conserved Olf/EBF family of helix-loop-helix
transcription factors, members of which play important roles in neural
development and B-cell maturation (Wang et al., 2002).

CLONING

By sequencing clones from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA library,
Nagase et al. (2000) cloned EBF4, which they designated KIAA1442. They
identified an Alu element in the 3-prime untranslated region, and found
that the deduced 627-amino acid protein shares significant similarity to
the mouse Olf1 (EBF; 164343) transcription factor. RT-PCR ELISA detected
highest EBF4 expression in lung, ovary, kidney, fetal brain, and several
specific adult brain regions. Intermediate expression was detected in
heart, whole adult brain, pancreas, testis, and fetal liver, and low
expression was detected in adult liver, skeletal muscle, and spleen.

Wang et al. (2002) cloned mouse Ebf4, which they designated O/E-4, from
olfactory epithelium RNA. The deduced full-length protein contains an
N-terminal DNA binding domain, followed by a repeated helix-loop-helix
motif (rHLH) and a proline/serine-rich C-terminal domain. Wang et al.
(2002) identified 3 additional alternatively spliced transcripts that
encoded shorter proteins that differed after the first helix of the rHLH
motif. PCR analysis of mouse tissues detected highest expression in
olfactory epithelium and lower amounts in lung, spleen, and kidney. The
transcript encoding the full-length protein predominated, and the
expression of splice variants appeared to be differentially regulated
between neuronal and nonneuronal tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays, Wang et al. (2002) found
that all splice variants of mouse Ebf4 were able to bind the Olf1 site,
a pseudopalindromic consensus sequence. An Ebf4 isoform lacking the
second helix of the rHLH motif bound the Olf1 consensus site as an
apparent dimer, indicating that an intact rHLH motif is not necessary
for dimer formation and DNA binding. All Ebf4 isoforms were weaker than
O/E-1 (EBF), O/E-2 (EBF3; 607407) and O/E-3 (EBF2; 609934) in
transcriptional activation of a reporter construct. Full-length Ebf4
showed strongest transactivator activity.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (2000) mapped the EBF4 gene
to chromosome 20.

271150	TITLE #271150 SPINAL MUSCULAR ATROPHY, TYPE IV; SMA4
;;SPINAL MUSCULAR ATROPHY, ADULT FORM;;
SPINAL MUSCULAR ATROPHY, PROXIMAL, ADULT, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
DESCRIPTION A number sign (#) is used with this entry because autosomal recessive
adult-onset spinal muscular atrophy type IV (SMA4) is caused by mutation
or deletion in the SMN1 gene (600354).

Allelic disorders with overlapping phenotypes of differing severity and
age at onset include SMA type I (253300), SMA type II (253550), and SMA
type III (253400).

CLINICAL FEATURES

Pearn et al. (1978) described 9 patients from 6 families with
adult-onset spinal muscular atrophy. The median age at onset was 35
years, and the mean age at initial medical presentation was 37 years.
The condition was relatively benign, with symmetrical proximal muscle
involvement and preservation of the distal musculature. Family studies
suggested autosomal recessive inheritance.

Brahe et al. (1995) reported 6 patients from 4 families with autosomal
recessive adult-onset SMA. Age at onset ranged from 20 to 32 years, and
symptoms included tongue fasciculations, hand tremor, symmetrical
weakness of the proximal muscles that was more severe in the lower
limbs, and atrophy of the quadriceps muscle. Three patients had
bilateral hypertrophy of the calves. One patient was very mildly
affected; 3 patients had done military service, apparently without
problems. In a letter, Zerres et al. (1995) noted that they defined SMA
type IV as onset after age 30; patients with onset before age 30 years
who retained the ability to walk were defined as having SMA type III.

Clermont et al. (1995) reported a 73-year-old woman who developed type
IV SMA at age 47, with proximal muscle weakness, muscular atrophy, and
patellar areflexia. Three of her 5 children had SMA type II, and all
died before age 15 years. Molecular analysis showed that the mother had
deletion of SMN exons 7 and 8 on both chromosomes, but no DNA from the
children was available. Clermont et al. (1995) concluded that adult and
childhood SMA are allelic disorders, emphasizing the continuum of
clinical phenotypes caused by SMN gene mutations and deletions.

CLINICAL MANAGEMENT

Weihl et al. (2006) reported increased quantitative muscle strength and
subjective function in 7 adult patients with SMA3/SMA4 who were treated
with oral valproate for a mean duration of 8 months. Most patients
reported improvement within a few months of beginning treatment. The
authors noted that previous studies (see Brichta et al., 2003) had
suggested that inhibitors of histone deacetylase, such as valproate, may
increase SMN2 gene transcription and result in increased production of
full-length SMN protein.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 6 patients with SMA4, Brahe et al. (1995) identified deletion of
exons 7 and 8 of the SMN1 gene, indicating that autosomal recessive
adult SMA is allelic to the childhood forms of SMA.

Mazzei et al. (2004) found evidence for a gene conversion event in SMN1
in 3 patients with SMA4, supporting the notion that a gene conversion
event is usually associated with a milder SMA phenotype and a later age
at disease onset.

- Modifying Factors

Wirth et al. (2006) analyzed SMN2 copy number in 115 patients with SMA3
or SMA4 who had confirmed homozygous absence of SMN1 and found that 62%
of SMA3 patients with age of onset less than 3 years had 2 or 3 SMN2
copies, whereas 65% of SMA3 patients with age of onset greater than 3
years had 4 to 5 SMN2 copies. Of the 4 adult-onset (SMA4) patients, 3
had 4 SMN2 copies and 1 had 6 copies. Wirth et al. (2006) concluded that
SMN2 may have a disease-modifying role in SMA, with a greater SMN2 copy
number associated with later onset and better prognosis.

- Heterogeneity

Hahnen et al. (1995) reported 4 patients with onset of SMA after age 30
who showed no homozygous deletion of exons 7 and 8 of the SMN1 gene,
suggesting genetic heterogeneity. However, the 4 patients with presumed
SMA IV had no family history, and spontaneous autosomal dominant
mutation at a different locus could not be excluded.

611663	TITLE *611663 TBC1 DOMAIN FAMILY, MEMBER 20; TBC1D20
;;C20ORF140
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Sklan et al. (2007) used a 2-hybrid screen to isolate proteins that bind
with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) nonstructural protein NS5A. One such
protein, TBC1D20, contains a TBC (Tre2, Bub2, and Cdc16) domain found in
most Rab-GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), which are important in
vesicular membrane transport. Immunoprecipitation of tagged TBC1D20
showed that the precipitate included HCV NS5A, confirming the
interaction. Deletion experiments mapped the interaction domain with
NS5A to the C-terminal domain of TBC1D20.

GENE FUNCTION

Sklan et al. (2007) showed that reduction of TBC1D20 expression by siRNA
severely impaired HCV replication and inhibited new infection. The
authors noted that the interaction of HCV with TBC1D20, a protein that
may mediate endocytosis, trafficking, and sorting of cellular proteins,
represents a new mechanism by which viruses could subvert the host cell
and that this insight may offer a new route for pharmacologic
intervention.

Sklan et al. (2007) showed that TBC1D20 colocalized with calnexin
(114217) in the endoplasmic reticulum, which led them to investigate
Rabs associated with the ER as possible targets of TBC1D20. They
identified RAB1 (179508) as the GTPase activated by TBC1D20.

MAPPING

Scott (2007) mapped the TBC1D20 gene to chromosome 20p13 based on an
alignment of the TBC1D20 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AL121747) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.2).

;;PTTG-BINDING FACTOR; PBF;;
CHROMOSOME 21 OPEN READING FRAME 1; C21ORF1;;
CHROMOSOME 21 OPEN READING FRAME 3; C21ORF3
DESCRIPTION In the course of constructing a transcript map for chromosome 21, Yaspo
et al. (1995) isolated numerous coding segments from 21q22.3, including
transcription unit TU6. Yaspo et al. (1998) cloned cDNAs corresponding
to TU6 by screening a human fetal thymus cDNA library with a partial
cDNA and trapped exon from TU6. Homology searches of sequence databases
using the translated sequence did not detect similarities to known
proteins, and the authors named the novel gene C21ORF3. The predicted
180-amino acid C21ORF3 protein has features of a type Ia integral
membrane protein and contains the tetrapeptide YXRF, a motif observed in
proteins internalized via coated pit-mediated endocytosis. Northern blot
analysis detected a 2.69-kb C21ORF3 mRNA in all tissues examined.

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen on a human testis cDNA library with rat
pituitary tumor-transforming gene (PTTG; 604147) as bait, Chien and Pei
(2000) isolated a cDNA encoding PTTG1IP, which they called PBF
(PTTG-binding factor). Sequence analysis predicted that the 179-amino
acid PBF protein, which is 92% identical to C21ORF3, contains multiple
phosphorylation sites, 5 potential N- and O-glycosylation sites, a
potential N-terminal sorting signal, and a C-terminal nuclear
localization signal (NLS). Northern and dot blot analysis detected a
2.8-kb PBF transcript in all tissues tested, with highest expression in
placenta. Pull-down and coimmunoprecipitation analyses showed that PBF
and PTTG interact specifically via their C-terminal regions. Western
blot analysis and immunofluorescence microscopy showed that whereas PTTG
is expressed primarily in the cytoplasm, PBF is expressed in both the
cytoplasm and nucleus. The authors demonstrated that PBF, via its NLS,
facilitates the translocation of PTTG to the nucleus. Reporter assay
analysis indicated that coexpression of PBF and PTTG induces
transcription of basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF2; 134920).

Using FISH on metaphase chromosomes and chromatin fibers, Yaspo et al.
(1998) mapped the PTTG1IP gene, which they called C21ORF3, to 21q22.3,
approximately 200 kb distal to D21S171.

606055	TITLE *606055 PHOSPHATIDYLCHOLINE TRANSFER PROTEIN; PCTP
;;START DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 2; STARD2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Phosphatidylcholine (PC) transfer protein (PCTP) is a cytosolic protein
first purified from bovine and rat liver that catalyzes intermembrane
transfer of PC. By searching an EST database for homologs of bovine
Pctp, followed by 5-prime RACE and PCR of a kidney cDNA library, Cohen
et al. (1999) obtained a cDNA encoding human PCTP. The deduced 214-amino
acid human protein is 76% and 80% identical to bovine and rat Pctp,
respectively. Northern blot analysis revealed wide expression of an
approximately 2.3-kb PCTP transcript in all tissues tested except
thymus. Highest expression was detected in liver, placenta, testis,
kidney, and heart, and lowest levels were found in brain and lung.

Van Helvoort et al. (1999) cloned human and mouse PCTP. They noted that
the sn2 fatty acyl-binding domain is 100% identical in the rodent,
bovine, and human proteins.

GENE STRUCTURE

Using Southern blot analysis, van Helvoort et al. (1999) determined that
PCTP is a single-copy gene. By genomic sequence analysis, Cohen et al.
(1999) showed that the PCTP gene contains 6 exons and spans 13 to 23 kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Cohen et al. (1999) mapped the PCTP gene
to 17q21-q22. They localized the mouse gene to the central portion of
chromosome 11.

ANIMAL MODEL

Van Helvoort et al. (1999) disrupted the Pctp gene in mice. Pctp
knockout mice showed no defects in the secretion of PC into bile or lung
surfactant, and the lipid content and composition of bile and surfactant
was normal. The authors concluded that PCTP does not play a major role
in transporting PC from the endoplasmic reticulum, where it is
synthesized, to the hepatocyte canalicular membrane.

611218	TITLE *611218 GASDERMIN A; GSDMA
;;GASDERMIN 1; GSDM1;;
GSDM
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Saeki et al. (2000) cloned Gsdma, which they called Gsdm1, from newborn
mouse skin. The deduced 446-amino acid protein contains a leucine zipper
motif. Northern blot analysis detected Gsdm1 expression in mouse
stomach, skin, and esophagus, but not in other tissues examined.
Northern blot analysis of human tissues detected GSDM1 expression in
stomach only.

By database and sequence analysis, Tamura et al. (2007) identified
several members of the gasdermin family, including GSDMA, GSDMB
(611221), and GSDMC (608384).

By RT-PCR of human stomach RNA, Saeki et al. (2007) cloned GSDM1. GSDM1
mRNA was detected in epithelium of stomach, esophagus, mammary gland,
and skin. Both GSDM1 mRNA and protein were preferentially expressed in
differentiated gastric pit cells and not in proliferating cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Using Northern blot analysis, Saeki et al. (2000) found reduced
expression of GSDM1 in several human gastric cancer cell lines.

Saeki et al. (2007) found that the GSDM gene was frequently silenced in
primary gastric cancers and in gastric cancer cell lines. GSDM showed
apoptotic activity upon expression in a human gastric cancer cell line.
LMO1 (186921), RUNX3 (600210), and TGF-beta receptor II (TGFBR2; 190182)
were coexpressed with GSDM in pit cells, and both LMO1 and RUNX3 bound
to the GSDM promoter in vitro. TGF-beta (TGFB1; 190180) upregulated LMO1
and GSDM expression and induced apoptosis, and induction of apoptosis
was inhibited by suppression of LMO1, RUNX3, and GSDM expression. Saeki
et al. (2007) concluded that GSDM is a component of TGF-beta signaling
that induces apoptosis in gastric pit cells.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Saeki et al. (2000) mapped the GSDMA gene
to chromosome 17q12. They mapped the mouse gene to a region of
chromosome 11 that shows homology of synteny to human chromosome 17q12.

By genomic sequence analysis, Tamura et al. (2007) mapped the GSDMA gene
to chromosome 17q21. On mouse chromosome 11, they identified 3 GSDMA
orthologs, which they called Gsdma1, Gsdma2, and Gsdma3, respectively.

603889	TITLE *603889 SIGNAL REGULATORY PROTEIN, BETA-1; SIRPB1
DESCRIPTION Signaling through receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) regulates the growth
of many cell types. The transmembrane protein SIRP-alpha-1 (602461) is a
substrate of activated RTKs and binds to SH2 domains. Kharitonenkov et
al. (1997) defined 2 subfamilies of SIRPs (signal regulatory proteins).
Members of the SIRP-alpha subfamily have a cytoplasmic SHP2-binding
domain; members of the SIRP-beta subfamily lack this cytoplasmic tail.
Kharitonenkov et al. (1997) cloned 4 homologous SIRP genes. The
SIRP-beta-1 gene encodes a 398-amino acid polypeptide which lacks the
C-terminal SHP2-binding cytoplasmic domain.

;;AZI2, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF; AZ2;;
NAK-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 1; NAP1;;
TILP
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

AZI2, or NAP1, contributes to the activation of NFKB (see
164011)-dependent gene expression by activating IKK-related kinases,
such as NAK (TBK1; 604834) (Fujita et al., 2003).

CLONING

By yeast 2-hybrid screening of a HeLa cell cDNA library using NAK as
bait, followed by screening a testis cDNA library, Fujita et al. (2003)
isolated a cDNA encoding NAP1. The predicted 392-amino acid protein has
a calculated molecular mass of 44.8 kD and is homologous to mouse Azi2
(Miyagawa et al., 1999). Northern blot analysis revealed ubiquitous
expression of 3.2- and 4.2-kb transcripts, with highest levels in
pancreas and testis. In contrast to NAK, NAP1 was also highly expressed
in thymus. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated cytoplasmic
expression of NAP1 in fibroblasts.

GENE FUNCTION

By mutation, binding, and coimmunoprecipitation analyses, Fujita et al.
(2003) determined that residues 158 to 270 of NAP1 interacted with NAK.
Coexpression studies showed that NAP1 also interacted with IKKE (IKBKE;
605048), but not with IKKG (IKBKG; 300248) or IKKB (IKBKB; 603258).
Binding of NAP1 to NAK increased NAK kinase activity, resulting in
phosphorylation of ser536 of RELA (164014), and activated NFKB. RNA
interference analysis showed that NAP1 depletion impaired TNF
(191160)-induced NFKB activation and promoted TNF-induced apoptosis.
Fujita et al. (2003) concluded that the NAK-NAP1 complex may protect
cells from TNF-induced apoptosis by promoting NFKB activation.

MAPPING

Scott (2006) mapped the NAP1 gene to chromosome 3p24.1 based on sequence
similarity between the NAP1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AY151386) and a
chromosome 3 clone (GenBank GENBANK AC021117).

611906	TITLE *611906 FIBRONECTIN TYPE III DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 5; FNDC5
;;FRCP2
IRISIN, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database searching with the sequence of mouse Fndc4 (611905) as
query, Teufel et al. (2002) identified mouse Fndc5. The deduced
203-amino acid protein, like the Fndc4 protein, contains an N-terminal
signal peptide, a fibronectin type III domain, and a transmembrane
domain. The 2 proteins share 60% identity in the FNIII domain and 86% in
the transmembrane domain. Also by database analysis, Teufel et al.
(2002) identified human FNDC5, which shares over 95% amino acid homology
with mouse Fndc5. They found no homologs in invertebrates. Northern blot
analysis of multiple mouse tissues detected highest expression of Fndc5
in adult brain and heart, and low expression in lung, skeletal muscle,
and testis. Northern blot analysis of mouse embryonic mRNA first
detected Fndc5 expression at embryonic day 11, with strongest expression
at E15 and decreasing expression at E17. In situ hybridization
demonstrated expression of Fndc5 in the fore- and midbrain, as well as
in the brachial arches and the heart. Overexpression of a GFP-Fndc5
fusion protein in COS cells showed localization predominantly in the
endoplasmic reticulum, with small amounts in the plasma membrane.

GENE STRUCTURE

Irisin is a 22-kD cleaved fragment that comprises most of the
fibronectin-3 domain of FNDC5 and is comprised of 110 amino acids
(Bostrom et al., 2012). Mouse and human irisin are 100% identical.

GENE FUNCTION

In mouse, Bostrom et al. (2012) demonstrated that PGC1-alpha (604517)
expression in muscle stimulates an increase in expression of FNDC5, a
membrane protein that is cleaved and secreted as a novel hormone,
irisin. Irisin acts on white adipose cells in culture and in vivo to
stimulate UCP1 (113730) expression and a broad program of brown fat-like
development. Irisin is induced with exercise in mice and humans, and
mildly increased irisin levels in the blood cause an increase in energy
expenditure in mice with no changes in movement or food intake. This
results in improvements in obesity and glucose homeostasis. Bostrom et
al. (2012) postulated that irisin could be therapeutic for human
metabolic disease and other disorders that are improved with exercise.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the FNDC5
gene to chromosome 1 (TMAP SHGC-74545). Teufel et al. (2002) mapped the
mouse Fndc5 gene to chromosome 4.

604222	TITLE *604222 ACTIN-RELATED PROTEIN 3; ACTR3
;;ARP3
DESCRIPTION The Arp2/3 protein complex has been implicated in the control of actin
polymerization in cells. The human complex consists of 7 subunits: the
actin-related proteins ARP2 (ACTR2; 604221) and ARP3 (ACTR3), ARC41
(ARPC1B; 604223), ARC34 (ARPC2; 604224), ARC21 (ARPC3; 604225), ARC20
(ARPC4; 604226), and ARC16 (ARPC5; 604227). See ACTR2 for additional
information about the Arp2/3 complex.

CLONING

By searching an EST database with peptide sequences from the 7 subunits
of the human ARP2/3 complex, Welch et al. (1997) identified full-length
human cDNAs encoding each subunit. The ARP3 cDNA encodes a deduced
418-amino acid protein that is identical to bovine Arp3, 59% identical
to S. pombe Arp3, and 58% identical to S. cerevisiae Arp3. ARP3
localizes to the lamellipodia of stationary and locomoting fibroblasts.
It also localizes to the actin tails assembled by moving intracellular
Listeria monocytogenes bacteria and to actin clouds surrounding
stationary L. monocytogenes (Welch et al., 1997). ARP3 was not detected
in cellular bundles of actin filaments.

Machesky et al. (1997) purified the ARP2/3 complex from human
neutrophils and sequenced peptides from each of the subunits. Western
blot analysis detected ARP3 and ARC34 in all human tissues tested.

GENE FUNCTION

In a functional genomic screen using RNA interference to identify human
genes involved in ciliogenesis control, Kim et al. (2010) identified 2
gelsolin family proteins, GSN (137350) and AVIL (613397), which regulate
cytoskeletal actin organization by severing actin filaments. Depletion
of GSN proteins by 2 independent siRNAs significantly reduced ciliated
cell numbers, indicating that actin filament severing is involved in
ciliogenesis. In contrast, silencing of actin-related protein ACTR3,
which is a major constituent of the ARP2/3 complex that is necessary for
nucleating actin polymerization at filament branches, caused a
significant increase in cilium length and also facilitated ciliogenesis
independently of serum starvation. Kim et al. (2010) concluded that
their observations indicated an inhibitory role of branched actin
network formation in ciliogenesis.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Volkmann et al. (2001) performed electron cryomicroscopy and
3-dimensional reconstruction of Acanthamoeba castellanii and S.
cerevisiae Arp2/3 complexes bound to the WASP (301000) carboxy-terminal
domain. Asymmetric, oblate ellipsoids were revealed. Image analysis of
actin branches indicated that the complex binds the side of the mother
filament, and ARP2 and ARP3 are the first 2 subunits of the daughter
filament. Comparison to the actin-free WASP-activated complexes suggests
that branch initiation involves large-scale structural rearrangements
within ARP2/3.

Robinson et al. (2001) determined the crystal structure of bovine ARP2/3
complex at 2.0-angstrom resolution. ARP2 and ARP3 are folded like actin,
with distinctive surface features. Subunits ARPC2 and ARPC4 in the core
of the complex associate through long carboxy-terminal alpha helices and
have similarly folded amino-terminal alpha/beta domains. ARPC1 is a
7-blade beta propeller with an insertion that may associate with the
side of an actin filament. ARPC3 and ARPC5 are globular alpha-helical
subunits. Robinson et al. (2001) predicted that WASP/SCAR proteins
activate ARP2/3 complex by bringing ARP2 into proximity with ARP3 for
nucleation of a branch on the side of a preexisting actin filament.

600692	TITLE *600692 TROPONIN T3, FAST SKELETAL; TNNT3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The contraction of striated muscle is initiated by the binding of
intracellular calcium to the troponin complex located in the thin
filaments. The complex consists of the 3 different troponins, designated
troponin C (e.g., 191039), troponin T (e.g., 191041), and troponin I
(e.g., 191042). The troponin T subunit binds the complex to tropomyosin
(191010). The troponin T proteins occur as multiple isoforms that are
encoded by different members of a multigene family, the members of which
undergo alternative splicing (see also 191045). The fast skeletal
troponin T genes (also symbolized TNTF by Wu et al., 1994) have been
characterized in various species and have been shown to produce isoforms
as a consequence of differential splicing of any of 5 exons (exons 4-8)
at the 5-prime end of the gene or of exon 16 (or alpha) and 17 (or beta)
at the 3-prime end of the gene. The alpha and beta isoforms differ in 14
amino acids at the carboxy-terminus of the protein. The beta isoform is
constitutively expressed through development, whereas the alpha isoform
is primarily found in adult muscle. Wu et al. (1994) cloned the human
TNTF beta isoform cDNA from a library made from 18-week human fetal
skeletal muscle, using a portion of the rabbit TnTf cDNA as a probe. The
human cDNAs were derived from a single-copy gene which is expressed
primarily in fetal skeletal muscle. The 259-amino acid predicted protein
has a hydrophilic hydropathy plot consisting mostly of alpha helical
sequence. Wu et al. (1994) observed that the human and rat proteins are
approximately 93% identical.

GENE STRUCTURE

Stefancsik et al. (2003) determined that the TNNT3 gene spans
approximately 19 kb and contains 19 exons, including 2 exons specific to
fetal and/or neonatal TNNT3. The upstream region contains a TATA box, a
CAAT box, several potential E boxes, and an MEF2 (see MEF2A;
600660)-binding site, but no CG-rich regions. The TNNT3 gene also
contains an intronic LINE1 element, as well as TC and CCA repeats that
are unique to human TNNT3.

MAPPING

By analysis of somatic cell hybrids followed by fluorescence in situ
hybridization, Mao et al. (1996) mapped the TNNT3 gene to chromosome
11p15.5. Koch et al. (1997) cloned the mouse homolog and mapped it to
the distal region of mouse chromosome 7, which shares homology of
synteny with human 11p15-q13.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Because distal arthrogryposis type 1 (DA1; 108120) can be caused by
mutations in the TPM2 gene (190990) and distal arthrogryposis type 2B
(DA2B; 601680) by mutations in the TNNI2 gene (191043), Sung et al.
(2003) hypothesized that mutations in genes encoding other contractile
apparatus proteins specific to fast-twitch myofibers might also cause
multiple congenital contractures. They sequenced the TNNT3 gene in 47
families with either classic Freeman-Sheldon syndrome (193700) or DA2B,
and identified an arg63-to-his mutation (R63H; 600692.0001) in a woman
with DA2B and her 2 affected daughters.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
ARTHROGRYPOSIS, DISTAL, TYPE 2B
TNNT3, ARG63HIS

In a woman with distal arthrogryposis multiplex congenita type 2B
(601680) and her 2 affected daughters, Sung et al. (2003) identified a
188G-A transition in exon 9 of the TNNT3 cDNA, resulting in an
arg63-to-his (R63H) substitution. The mutation was thought to be
disease-causing for several reasons: it was identified in the proband
and was also present in all affected family members; it was not found in
488 chromosomes from an ethnically matched control group; it results in
the substitution of an amino acid residue that is conserved in all
isoforms of troponin T (TnT), implying that this difference is likely to
have structural and/or functional consequences; and Varnava et al.
(1999) found that substitution of the homologous amino acid residue in
the cardiac-specific form of TnT (TNNT2; 191045) causes cardiomyopathy.

Gurnett et al. (2009) identified the R63H mutation as a de novo
occurrence in an infant with 4-extremity arthrogryposis but no facial
involvement. The authors noted that it is admittedly difficult to
diagnose mild forms of facial weakness, particularly in infancy,
although they classified the disorder in this child as distal
arthrogryposis-1 (108120).

IKAROS/BCL6 FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Ikaros proteins are lymphoid-restricted zinc finger transcription
factors that are considered master regulators of lymphocyte
differentiation. Klug et al. (1998) noted that there are at least 8
alternatively spliced transcripts of the Ikaros gene that encode
isoforms with common N-terminal and C-terminal domains. By screening a
Jurkat T-cell cDNA library with a mouse Ikaros cDNA, Molnar et al.
(1996) isolated human Ikaros cDNAs. The deduced human and mouse Ikaros
proteins are 95% identical. RT-PCR of human thymus and peripheral blood
leukocyte mRNAs detected 6 Ikaros splicing variants which were expressed
at similar levels and ratios as the corresponding mouse leukocyte Ikaros
transcripts. The authors found that Ikaros proteins are conserved in
sequence composition and relative expression between human T cells and
mouse thymocytes. Northern blot analysis demonstrated the expression of
7.5- and 4.5-kb Ikaros transcripts in human thymus, spleen, and
peripheral blood leukocytes.

By PCR using primers based on a conserved nucleotide sequence of various
zinc finger proteins, Nietfeld and Meyerhans (1996) cloned human bone
marrow cDNAs encoding Ikaros, which they designated IK1. The deduced
519-amino acid protein is 93% identical to the mouse Ikaros isoform
1/LyF1 isoform VI and contains 4 N-terminal and 2 C-terminal zinc finger
domains. The authors detected 3 human mRNA species by Northern blot
analysis: a 4.4-kb transcript, which was prominent in peripheral blood
leukocytes; a 6.0-kb transcript, which was strongly expressed in spleen,
thymus, lymph node, and bone marrow; and a 7.0-kb transcript. They
stated that the human and mouse Ikaros genes have similar overall
transcription patterns.

Dijon et al. (2008) stated that the N-terminal Kruppel-like zinc finger
domain of Ikaros proteins is involved in DNA binding, while the
C-terminal zinc finger domain mediates homo- or heterodimerization with
other Ikaros proteins. Alternative splicing of exons 3 to 6 produces
Ikaros isoforms with 0 to 4 N-terminal zinc fingers, and those with at
least 3 efficiently bind DNA. The DNA-binding Ikaros isoforms include
IK1, IK2, IK3, and IKX, and IK4 can bind DNA on palindromic sequences.
IK5, IK6, IK7, and IK8 are considered dominant-negative isoforms due to
their capacity to bind other isoforms and their inefficiency in binding
DNA.

GENE FUNCTION

Harker et al. (2002) showed that Ikaros may play an important role in
CD4 (186940) versus CD8 (see CD8A; 186910) lineage commitment decisions
by demonstrating: (1) that it binds to regulatory elements in the
endogenous CD8A locus in vivo using thymocyte chromatin
immunoprecipitations; (2) that Ikaros suppresses position effect
variegation of transgenes driven by CD8 regulatory elements; and (3)
that mice with reduced levels of Ikaros and Aiolos (606221) show an
apparent increase in CD4 populations with immature phenotype, i.e.,
cells that fail to activate the CD8A gene. The authors proposed that
Ikaros family members function as activators of the CD8A gene and that
their associated activities are critical for appropriate chromatin
remodeling transitions during thymocyte differentiation and lineage
commitment.

Ezzat et al. (2005) demonstrated that Ikaros is expressed in the
hormone-producing pituitary corticomelanotroph cells of mice, where it
binds the proopiomelanocortin promoter and regulates endogenous gene
expression. Ikaros-null mice had contraction of the pituitary
corticomelanotroph population, reduced circulating adrenocorticotrophic
hormone levels, and adrenal glucocorticoid insufficiency. Hematopoietic
reconstitution failed to correct this hormonal deficit, but the
phenotype of reduced body weight and diminished survival was rescued by
systemic glucocorticoid-hormone administration. Ezzat et al. (2005)
concluded that Ikaros plays a role in orchestrating immune-endocrine
development and function.

Yap et al. (2005) identified Ikaros-binding elements in the 5-prime
flanking regions of pufferfish, mouse, and human STAT4 (600558).
Transactivation, electrophoretic mobility shift, and RNA interference
analyses showed that Ikaros bound to the STAT4 promoter and was involved
in regulation of STAT4 in human T cells.

Dijon et al. (2008) found that purified CD34 (142230)-positive human
cord blood cells and adult peripheral blood cells that were cultured
under erythroid conditions expressed the DNA-binding Ikaros isoforms IK1
through IK4, but not the dominant-negative isoform IK6.
Immunoprecipitation analysis showed that expression of IK6 in these
cells resulted in complex formation between IK6 and IK1, and IK6
decreased cell number and increased cell death. IK6 overexpression
disturbed erythroid differentiation and expression of erythroid-specific
genes, although it had no effect on Ikaros expression, and favored
myelopoiesis by promoting expression of myeloid-specific genes.

GENE STRUCTURE

Dijon et al. (2008) stated that the IKZF1 gene contains 7 translated
exons.

MAPPING

Using somatic cell hybrid DNAs, Molnar et al. (1996) mapped the human
Ikaros gene to 7p13-p11.1, near the EGFR gene (131550). They mapped the
mouse Ikaros gene to chromosome 11 by interspecific backcross analysis.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Ikaros is required for normal lymphocyte development. Germline mutant
mice that express only non-DNA-binding dominant-negative 'leukemogenic'
Ikaros isoforms lacking critical N-terminal zinc fingers develop an
aggressive form of lymphoblastic leukemia 3 to 6 months after birth (see
'Animal Model' below). These facts prompted Sun et al. (1999) to seek
molecular abnormalities involving the Ikaros gene in acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (ALL2; 613067) in infants. In leukemic cells from 12 ALL
infants less than 1 year of age, Sun et al. (1999) found high-level
expression of dominant-negative isoforms of Ikaros with abnormal
subcellular compartmentalization patterns. PCR cloning and nucleotide
sequencing were used to identify the specific Ikaros isoforms and detect
Ikaros gene mutations in these cells. Leukemic cells from 7 of 7 infants
with ALL, including 5 of 5 MLL-AF4-positive (159557) infants, expressed
dominant-negative Ikaros isoforms IK4, IK7, and IK8 that lack critical
N-terminal zinc fingers. In 6 of 7 patients, Sun et al. (1999) detected
an in-frame deletion of 10 amino acids (KSSMPQKFLG) upstream of the
transcription-activation domain adjacent to the C-terminal zinc fingers
of IK2, IK4, IK7, and IK8. In contrast, only wildtype IK1 and IK2
isoforms with normal nuclear localization were found in normal infant
bone marrow cells and infant thymocytes. These results implicated the
expression of dominant-negative Ikaros isoforms and the disruption of
normal Ikaros function in the leukemogenesis of ALL in infants.

Nakase et al. (2000) found overexpression of the dominant-negative IK6
isoform in 14 of 41 B-cell patients with adult B-cell ALL. None of the
other dominant-negative isoforms of the Ikaros gene were detected by
RT-PCR analysis. Southern blot analysis with PstI digestion revealed
that those patients with the dominant-negative IK6 isoform might have
small mutations in the Ikaros locus. The results suggested that Ikaros
plays a key role in human B-cell malignancies through the
dominant-negative isoform IK6.

Using RT-PCR to detect Ikaros isoforms with the 30-base deletion in exon
6, Payne et al. (2001) showed that transcripts for IK1 and IK1 with the
deletion were present in normal cord blood and bone marrow, as well as
in 3 ALL cell lines. In addition, they identified an isoform, IKX, that
was identical to IK3 except that it included exon 6; IKX was generated
from a novel exon combination with and without the 30-base deletion.
Payne et al. (2001) detected multiple DNA-binding and nonbinding
isoforms with a 60-base insertion linked to leukemia expressed at the
RNA level in normal hemopoietic cells. Immunoblot analysis indicated
that the predominant isoform in normal cells is IKX, while the
predominant form in leukemic cells is IK1.

In a genomewide analysis of leukemic cells from 242 pediatric ALL
patients using high resolution, single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
arrays and genomic DNA sequencing, Mullighan et al. (2007) identified
mutations in genes encoding principal regulators of B-lymphocyte
development and differentiation in 40% of B-progenitor ALL cases.
Deletions were detected in IKZF1, IKZF3 (606221),TCF3 (147141), EBF1
(164343), and LEF1 (153245). The PAX5 (167414) gene was the most
frequent target of somatic mutation, being altered in 31.7% of cases.

The Philadelphia chromosome, a chromosomal abnormality that encodes
BCR-ABL1 (see 151410, 189980), is the defining lesion of chronic
myelogenous leukemia (CML) and a subset of acute lymphoblastic leukemia
(ALL). To define oncogenic lesions that cooperate with BCR-ABL1 to
induce ALL, Mullighan et al. (2008) performed a genomewide analysis of
diagnostic leukemia samples from 304 individuals with ALL, including 43
BCR-ABL1 B-progenitor ALLs and 23 CML cases. IKZF1, encoding the
transcription factor Ikaros, was deleted in 83.7% of BCR-ABL1 ALL, but
not in chronic phase CML. Deletion of IKZF1 was also identified as an
acquired lesion at the time of transformation of CML to ALL (lymphoid
blast crisis). The IKZF1 deletions resulted in haploinsufficiency,
expression of a dominant-negative Ikaros isoform, or the complete loss
of Ikaros expression. Sequencing of IKZF1 deletion breakpoints suggested
that aberrant RAG-mediated recombination (see 179615) is responsible for
the deletions. Mullighan et al. (2008) concluded that genetic lesions
resulting in the loss of Ikaros function are an important event in the
development of BCR-ABL1 ALL.

Mullighan et al. (2009) identified deletions involving the IKZF1 gene in
leukemic cells of 63 (28.6%) of 221 children with B-cell acute
lymphoblastic leukemia. Cells from 20 patients had a deletion of coding
exons 3 through 6, resulting in the expression of a dominant-negative
form of IKZF1. IKZF1 deletions were associated with an increased risk of
relapse and adverse effects in the original cohort and in an independent
cohort of 258 patients (p values ranging from less than 0.001 to 0.004).

For a discussion of a possible association between variation in the
IKZF1 gene and acute lymphoblastic leukemia, see ALL2 (613067).

CYTOGENETICS

The BCL6 gene (109565), isolated from the breakpoints of 3q27-associated
chromosomal translocations, is implicated in diffuse large B-cell
lymphomas (DLBL). Hosokawa et al. (2000) described the molecular
characterization of novel t(3;7)(q27;p12) translocations in 2 patients
with DLBL. Molecular genetic analysis of the breakpoint area involving
BCL6 revealed the presence of the Ikaros gene. As a molecular
consequence of the translocation, the 5-prime regulatory region of BCL6
was replaced by the putative 5-prime regulatory region of the Ikaros
gene, probably leading to deregulated expression of the BCL6 gene
throughout B-cell differentiation. RT-PCR and FISH analyses of a patient
sample established that the translocation resulted in fusion of the
Ikaros and BCL6 genes. The clinical features of the 2 patients with DLBL
and t(3;7)(q27;p12) translocations were reported by Ichinohasama et al.
(1998).

ANIMAL MODEL

Mice homozygous for a germline mutation in the Ikaros DNA-binding domain
lack not only T and B lymphocytes and natural killer cells, but also
their earliest defined progenitors (Georgopoulos et al., 1994). In
contrast, the erythroid and myeloid lineages are intact in these mutant
mice. Klug et al. (1998) showed that the DNA-binding isoforms of mouse
Ikaros are localized in the nucleus of the most primitive hematopoietic
stem cell subset. They found that Ikaros localizes to heterochromatin in
Abelson-transformed pre-B lymphocytes. Changes in the RNA splicing
pattern of Ikaros occurred at 2 stages of lymphoid differentiation.

O'Neill et al. (1999, 2000) described the structure of a chromatin
remodeling complex associated with Ikaros that is present only in adult
hematopoietic cells. This complex binds to Ikaros-like DNA-binding
sites, including a long polypyrimidine-rich sequence upstream of the
human delta-globin gene (142000), and was thus called PYR complex.
Deletion of this sequence in a human beta locus-containing cosmid
(carrying sequences from the human gamma-A gene, 142200, through the
adult beta-globin gene, 141900) in transgenic mice resulted in delayed
switching from gamma-globin to beta-globin. Lopez et al. (2002) showed
that homozygous Ikaros-null mice lacked the PYR complex, demonstrating a
requirement for Ikaros in the formation of the complex on DNA.
Heterozygous Ikaros-null mice had about half as much PYR complex,
indicating a dosage effect for both Ikaros and PYR complex. They also
showed that Ikaros-null mice had multiple hematopoietic cell defects,
including anemia and megakaryocytic abnormalities, in addition to
lymphoid and stem cell defects. The null mice also had a delay in murine
embryonic-to-adult beta-globin switching and a delay in human
gamma-to-beta switching, consistent with the suggested role for PYR
complex in this process. Lastly, cDNA array analyses indicated that
several hematopoietic cell-specific genes in all blood lineages were
either up- or downregulated in 14-day embryos from Ikaros-null mice
compared with wildtype mice. These results indicated that Ikaros and PYR
complex function together in vivo at many adult hematopoietic
cell-specific genes and at intergenic sites, affecting their expression
and leading to pleiotropic hematopoietic defects.

Plasmacytoid dendritic cells are specialized dendritic cells that
produce high levels of type I interferon (see IFNA1; 147660) upon viral
infection. Allman et al. (2006) showed that mice expressing low levels
of Ikaros lacked peripheral plasmacytoid dendritic cells but not other
dendritic cell subsets. Loss of plasmacytoid dendritic cells was
associated with inability to produce type I interferon after challenge
with Tlr7 (300365) or Tlr9 (605474) ligands or murine cytomegalovirus.
Conventional dendritic cells were present in normal numbers and
exhibited normal responses to in vivo challenge with murine
cytomegalovirus or inactivated toxoplasma antigen.

611171	TITLE *611171 KIAA1598 GENE; KIAA1598
;;SHOOTIN1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned KIAA1598. The deduced protein
contains 446 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA detected very high expression in
adult brain, followed by liver, kidney, pancreas, and spinal cord.
Expression was moderate in heart, lung, spleen, testis, ovary, fetal
liver, and fetal brain, and low in adult skeletal muscle. Expression was
high in all specific adult brain regions examined, particularly in
thalamus and hippocampus.

By database analysis, Toriyama et al. (2006) determined that the
KIAA1598 gene, which they called SHOOTIN1, encodes a 456-amino acid
protein with a calculated molecular mass of 52.6 kD. KIAA1598 contains 3
coiled-coil domains and a proline-rich region.

GENE FUNCTION

Toriyama et al. (2006) found Shootin1 upregulated during polarization of
rat hippocampal neurons in culture. Expression fluctuated among multiple
neurites and eventually Shootin1 accumulated asymmetrically in a single
neurite, which led to axon induction and neuron polarization. Disturbing
the asymmetric organization of Shootin1 with excess Shootin1 disrupted
polarization, whereas repressing Shootin1 expression inhibited
polarization. Overexpression and RNA interference studies suggested that
Shootin1 was required for spatially localized phosphoinositide 3-kinase
(see PIK3CG; 601232) activity. Shootin1 showed anterograde transport to
the growth cones and diffused back to the soma, and inhibition of this
transport prevented its asymmetric accumulation in neurons. Toriyama et
al. (2006) proposed that Shootin1 is involved in the generation of
internal asymmetric signals required for neuronal polarization.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the
KIAA1598 gene to chromosome 10 (TMAP RH77773).

;;ROD-DERIVED CONE VIABILITY FACTOR; RDCVF;;
THIOREDOXIN-LIKE 6, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF; TXNL6;;
LOC115861
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By expression cloning using a viability assay based on cone-enriched
primary cultures from chicken embryos to isolate factors that could
support cone survival, Leveillard et al. (2004) identified Nxnl1, which
they called Rdcvf, a truncated thioredoxin-like protein specifically
expressed in photoreceptors. Rdcvf has 33% similarity to thioredoxin
(TXN; 187700). The Rdcvf protein contains a potential N-glycosylation
site and lacks a signal peptide sequence. The C terminus of Rdcvf
interrupts the thioredoxin motif, and unlike other members of the
thioredoxin family, Rdcvf did not have detectable oxidoreductase
activity; however, an alternatively spliced form of Rdcvf mRNA results
in a longer protein with a C-terminal extension and could have
oxidoreductase activity. Leveillard et al. (2004) suggested that Rdcvf
may be a bifunctional protein, with one extracellular form involved in
cone viability and the other, with the extended C terminus, having
oxidoreductase activity. Factors secreted from rods have been shown to
be essential for cone viability (see Fintz et al., 2003). As cone loss
is responsible for the main visual handicap in retinitis pigmentosa (RP;
268000), the identification of the Rdcvf protein was seen by Leveillard
et al. (2004) as presenting new treatment possibilities for RP.

Chalmel et al. (2007) identified NXNL1 genes predicted to encode long
and short NXNL1 variants, which they called RDCVFL and RDCVFS,
respectively, in most vertebrates examined. Human RDCVFL contains 212
amino acids and, like the mouse protein, has a predicted C-terminal
thioredoxin-like domain that is absent in the predicted RDCVFS isoform.

GENE FUNCTION

Reichman et al. (2010) identified the homeodomain proteins CHX10/VSX2
(142993), VSX1 (605020), and PAX4 (167413), as well as the zinc finger
protein SP3 (601804), as factors that could stimulate both the mouse and
human NXNL1 promoter. In addition, CHX10/VSX2 bound to the NXNL1
promoter in vivo. Rdcvf was expressed in the inner as well as the outer
retina of mice. The loss of rods in the rd1 mouse, a model of retinitis
pigmentosa, was associated with decreased expression of Rdcvf by inner
retinal cells as well as by rods. Reichman et al. (2010) proposed an
alternative therapeutic strategy aimed at recapitulating RDCVF
expression in the inner retina, where cell loss is not significant, to
prevent secondary cone death and central vision loss in patients
suffering from retinitis pigmentosa.

GENE STRUCTURE

Chalmel et al. (2007) determined that the NXNL1 gene contains 2 exons.

MAPPING

Hartz (2013) mapped the NXNL1 gene to chromosome 19p13.11 based on an
alignment of the NXNL1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC014127) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

Chalmel et al. (2007) mapped the mouse Nxnl1 gene to chromosome 8.

120320	TITLE *120320 COLLAGEN, TYPE XII, ALPHA-1; COL12A1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By screening a cDNA library constructed from tendon fibroblast mRNA for
the presence of collagenous coding sequences, Gordon et al. (1987) found
a clone that encodes a polypeptide that is distinct but homologous to
type IX short-chain collagen polypeptides (see 120210). They named the
type IX-like collagen chain alpha-1(XII) (COL12A1). Gordon et al. (1987)
concluded that types IX and XII collagen are 2 homologous members of a
family of unique collagenous proteins that show tissue-specific patterns
of expression. Based on their structure and the properties of their
genes, this family of collagen appears to be distinct from fibrillar
collagens. This family, which also includes collagen type XIV (120324),
is referred to as the FACIT (fibril-associated collagens with
interrupted triple helices) group. Members of this group show
alternating triple-helical and non-triple-helical domains.

By screening a human genomic library with a chicken Col12a1 cDNA as
probe, Oh et al. (1992) isolated a partial COL12A1 cDNA. The predicted
amino acid sequence showed 91% identity with mouse Col12a1.

Gerecke et al. (1997) isolated overlapping cDNA clones encoding
full-length human COL12A1 polypeptides; a long variant encodes a
predicted 3,063-amino acid protein and a short variant encodes a
1,899-amino acid protein. The proteins are predicted to have a 24-amino
acid signal peptide, fibronectin type III repeats, von Willebrand factor
A domains, and 2 triple-helical domains. Human COL12A1 shares 92% and
78% sequence identity with the mouse and chicken Col12a1 proteins,
respectively. RT-PCR analysis detected both COL12A1 variants in human
amnion, chorion, skeletal muscle, and small intestine, and in cell
cultures of human dermal fibroblasts, keratinocytes, and endothelial
cells. Only the short variant was detected in human lung, placenta,
kidney, and in a squamous cell carcinoma cell line.

GENE STRUCTURE

Gordon et al. (1987) found that the exon/intron structure of the gene
appeared to be homologous to those of the COL9A1 (120210) and COL9A2
(120260) genes.

MAPPING

By linkage analysis using DNA from interspecific backcrosses with Mus
spretus, Oh et al. (1992) demonstrated that the mouse Col12a1 gene is
located on chromosome 9. By blot hybridization to DNA from human/hamster
hybrid cell lines, Oh et al. (1992) mapped the COL12A1 gene to
chromosome 6.

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Gerecke et al. (1997) mapped the
COL12A1 gene to 6q12-q13.
