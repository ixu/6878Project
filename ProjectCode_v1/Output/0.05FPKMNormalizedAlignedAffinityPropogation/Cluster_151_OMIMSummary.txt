DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ZBED proteins, such as ZBED1, originated from domesticated hAT DNA
transposons and encode regulatory proteins with diverse, fundamental
functions in vertebrates (Hayward et al., 2013).

CLONING

Nagase et al. (1998) cloned the ZBED1 gene, which they designated
KIAA0785, from an adult brain cDNA library, The transcript contains 2
repetitive elements in its 3-prime end and encodes a deduced 694-amino
acid protein. RT-PCR ELISA detected high expression in brain, lung, and
ovary, moderate expression in heart, liver, kidney, pancreas, spleen,
and testis, and low expression in skeletal muscle.

In a search for genes that escape X inactivation, Esposito et al. (1999)
identified ZBED1, which they called TRAMP, as a pseudoautosomal gene
with a functional homolog on the Y chromosome. By PCR of teratocarcinoma
cell line cDNA libraries, they obtained a full-length TRAMP cDNA. The
putative 694-amino acid TRAMP protein shares sequence similarity with
transposases of the Ac family. Moreover, TRAMP shares similarity with
Drosophila Dref, a transcriptional regulatory factor that specifically
binds the promoter-activating element DNA replication-related element
(DRE) of DNA replication-related genes. Northern blot analysis detected
a 5-kb TRAMP transcript in all human tissues examined, with highest
levels in skeletal muscle and heart. RT-PCR confirmed that TRAMP escapes
X inactivation. Esposito et al. (1999) identified putative terminal
inverted repeats (TIRs) and a duplicate target site flanking the TRAMP
gene, suggesting that it is part of an ancient transposable element.
However, the nucleotide differences in these sites and the TIR-binding
inactivity of the putative TRAMP protein suggested that this element is
not an autonomous transposon.

Yamashita et al. (2007) determined that ZBED1, which they called DREF,
contains an N-terminal BED domain and a C-terminal hATC dimerization
domain. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that endogenous DREF
localized to nuclei of HeLa cells during interphase, but it was absent
from condensed chromosomes during mitosis.

Hayward et al. (2013) stated that the 694-amino acid ZBED1 protein has
an N-terminal zinc finger BED domain, named after the domesticated
Drosophila proteins Beaf and Dref, and a C-terminal catalytic domain.
The catalytic domain contains an alpha-helical region, a hAT-type
dimerization motif, and a predicted catalytic DDE motif similar to that
found in the catalytic pockets of integrases of retroviruses and long
terminal repeat retrotransposons.

GENE FUNCTION

Ohshima et al. (2003) demonstrated that human DREF bound DNA with the
consensus sequence 5-prime-TGTCG(C/T)GA(T/C)A. They identified
DREF-binding sequences in the promoter regions of several genes related
to cell proliferation, and they demonstrated that DREF bound and
activated the histone H1 (see 142711) promoter. DREF expression was low
in serum-deprived normal human fibroblasts, but it was induced by serum
and reached a maximum during S phase. RNA interference experiments
targeting DREF inhibited S-phase entry and reduced histone H1 mRNA in
HeLa cells. Ohshima et al. (2003) concluded that DREF has a role in
regulating genes related to cell proliferation.

Using protein pull-down assays, crosslinking, and immunoprecipitation
analysis, Yamashita et al. (2007) showed that the isolated hACT domain
of human DREF and full-length DREF formed dimers, and that DREF mutants
lacking the hATC domain did not dimerize. Point mutations within the
hATC domain revealed that the conserved hydrophobic amino acids trp590,
trp591, and leu601 were critical for DREF self-association. The hATC
domain was also required for efficient nuclear accumulation of DREF via
importin beta-1 (KPNB1; 602738). A cluster of basic amino acids outside
the hATC domain was also necessary for DREF nuclear targeting. EMSA
revealed that the DREF N-terminal domain mediated DNA binding.

GENE STRUCTURE

Esposito et al. (1999) determined that ZBED1 is a single-exon gene.

MAPPING

By Southern blot analysis, Esposito et al. (1999) mapped the TRAMP gene
to chromosome Xp22.33. Using YAC contigs, they localized the gene 350 to
450 kb distal from the boundary of PAR1.

EVOLUTION

Hayward et al. (2013) found that ZBED genes originated from at least 2
independent hAT DNA transposon domestication events in ancestors of
primitive jawed vertebrates, since no orthologs of ZBEDs were identified
in jawless fish or more primitive vertebrates. ZBED1 belongs to the Ac
family of domesticated hAT DNA transposons, which also includes ZBED2
(615246), ZBED3 (615250), ZBED4 (612552), and ZBED6 (613512).

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are members of a
superfamily of ligand-gated ion channels that mediate fast signal
transmission at synapses. The nAChRs are thought to be (hetero)pentamers
composed of homologous subunits. See 118508 for additional background
information on nAChRs.

Fornasari et al. (1990) cloned the human alpha-3 subunit (CHRNA3) by
using a rat alpha-3 probe to screen a human neuroblastoma cDNA library.
The predicted 502-amino acid protein has a putative 28-amino acid signal
peptide. The mature protein is 93% identical to rat alpha-3 protein. On
Northern blots, alpha-3 was expressed predominantly as a 3.5-kb mRNA in
neuron-like cell lines, with an additional 2.0-kb mRNA seen in 1
ganglion-like cell line.

To examine the role of thymic AChRs in the anti-AChR response seen in
myasthenia gravis (254200), Mihovilovic and Roses (1991) independently
isolated the human alpha-3 subunit from a thymus cDNA library. The open
reading frame coded for a 503-amino acid protein with a 29-amino acid
putative signal peptide. On Northern blots, alpha-3 was transcribed as a
major 3.0-kb mRNA with other minor bands in thymus but not in muscle or
liver. Groot Kormelink and Luyten (1997) reported that alpha-3 was
transcribed as a 3.0-kb mRNA on Northern blots of a neuroblastoma cell
line.

Elliott et al. (1996) also cloned the human alpha-3 gene and
demonstrated that it encodes a functional receptor when expressed in
combination with human beta-2 (118507) or beta-4 (CHRNB4; 118509) in
Xenopus oocytes. Both Elliott et al. (1996) and Groot Kormelink and
Luyten (1997) noted differences with the sequence reported by Fornasari
et al. (1990).

GENE FUNCTION

Flora et al. (2000) found that CHRNA3 is partially coexpressed with
CHRNA5 (118505) in human tissues.

Transmitter-gated cation channels are detectors of excitatory chemical
signals at synapses in the nervous system. Khakh et al. (2000) showed
that structurally distinct alpha-3-beta-4 nicotinic and P2X(2) (600844)
channels influence each other when coactivated. The activation of one
channel type affects distinct kinetic and conductance states of the
other, and coactivation results in nonadditive responses owing to
inhibition of both channel types. State-dependent inhibition of
nicotinic channels was revealed most clearly with mutant P2X(2)
channels, and inhibition was decreased at lower densities of channel
expression. In synaptically coupled myenteric neurons, nicotinic fast
excitatory postsynaptic currents were occluded during activation of
endogenously coexpressed P2X channels. Khakh et al. (2000) concluded
that their data provide a molecular basis and a synaptic context for
cross-inhibition between transmitter-gated channels.

By using a combination of pharmacologic, molecular genetic,
electrophysiologic, and feeding studies, Mineur et al. (2011) found that
activation of hypothalamic alpha-3-beta-4 (118509) nicotinic
acetylcholine receptors leads to activation of proopiomelanocortin
(POMC; 176830) neurons. POMC neurons and subsequent activation of
melanocortin-4 receptors (MC4R; 155541) were critical for
nicotinic-induced decreases in food intake in mice. The study of Mineur
et al. (2011) demonstrated that nicotine decreases food intake and body
weight by influencing the hypothalamic melanocortin system and
identified critical molecular and synaptic mechanisms involved in
nicotine-induced decreases in appetite.

GENE STRUCTURE

Prompted by the finding that mutations in the CHRNA4 gene (118504) are
responsible for some cases of autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe
epilepsy (600513), Rempel et al. (1998) determined the genomic structure
of the CHRNA3 gene necessary for mutational analysis of this gene as a
candidate in families with epilepsy unlinked to CHRNA4.

MAPPING

Boulter et al. (1990) found that 3 genes encoding subunits of the
neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, alpha-3, alpha-5, and beta-4,
are clustered within a 68-kb segment of the rat genome. By somatic cell
hybrid analysis, Eng et al. (1991) mapped 3 cDNAs corresponding to these
genes to human chromosome 15 and to mouse chromosome 9. Linkage analysis
using CEPH pedigrees showed that the CHRNA5 gene (118505) is closely
linked to 5 DNA markers on chromosome 15. Using interspecies crosses in
mice, they found that the Acra5 gene is closely linked to the Mpi1 locus
(154550). Thus, the human gene is probably in the region 15q22-qter,
where the human MPI gene is located. Raimondi et al. (1992) mapped the
CHRNA3, CHRNA5, and CHRNB4 (118509) genes to 15q24 by in situ
hybridization. Furthermore, by Southern blot analysis of 2 genomic
clones, Raimondi et al. (1992) demonstrated that the 3 genes are
physically linked. Anand and Lindstrom (1992) confirmed the assignment
to human chromosome 15 by genomic Southern analysis of human/hamster
somatic cell hybrid DNAs. They similarly confirmed the assignment of
CHRNA5 and CHRNB4 to chromosome 15. Their Table 4 provided a
comprehensive listing of the chromosomal location of mouse and human
acetylcholinesterase receptor subunit genes.

Duga et al. (2001) showed that CHRNA3 and CHRNA5, which are encoded on
opposite DNA strands, share a 466-bp overlap region at their 3-prime
ends. This tail-to-tail overlap produces, at the mRNA level, a 100-bp
region of complementarity between CHRNA5 and CHRNA3 mature transcripts.
Several pairs of genes are arranged in a similar (tail-to-tail)
overlapping manner.

Amos et al. (2008) placed the CHRNA3, CHRNA5, CHRNB4, and PSMA4 (176846)
genes within a 100-kb region on chromosome 15q25.1.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In separate large genomewide association studies to find variants
associated with risk of lung cancer (see SQTL3; 612052), Hung et al.
(2008) and Thorgeirsson et al. (2008) identified strong association with
variation in the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor gene cluster on
chromosome 15q24. These studies identified 2 single-nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) in strong linkage disequilibrium, one in the CHRNA3
gene (118503.0001) and the other in the CHRNA5 gene (118505.0001), as
representing the strongest associations.

In a multistage genomewide association study to identify risk variants
for nonsmall cell lung cancer, Amos et al. (2008) found that the SNP
dbSNP rs1051730 (118503.0001) was significantly associated with risk.

ANIMAL MODEL

The alpha-3 subunit of the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor is
widely expressed in autonomic ganglia and in some parts of the brain.
The alpha-3 subunit can form heteromultimeric ion channels with other
alpha subunits and with beta-2 and beta-4 subunits. To understand better
the function of CHRNA3 in vivo, Xu et al. (1999) prepared a null
mutation for the alpha-3 gene by the deletion of exon 5 and found that
homozygous -/- mice lacked detectable mRNA on Northern blotting. The
null mice survived to birth but had impaired growth and increased
mortality before and after weaning. The null mice had extreme bladder
enlargement, dribbling urination, bladder infection, urinary stones, and
widely dilated ocular pupils that did not contract in response to light.
Detailed histologic studies of null mice showed no significant
abnormalities in brain or peripheral tissues except urinary bladder,
where inflammation was prominent. Ganglion cells and axons were present
in bladder and bowel. Bladder strips from null mice failed to contract
in response to 0.1 mM nicotine, but did contract in response to
electrical field stimulation or carbamoylcholine. The number of
acetylcholine-activated single-channel currents was severely reduced in
the neurons of superior cervical ganglia in null mice with 5
physiologically distinguishable nicotinic acetylcholine receptor
subtypes with different conductance and kinetic properties in wildtype
mice, all of which were reduced in null mice. The findings in the
alpha-3-null mice suggested that this subunit is an essential component
of the nicotinic receptors mediating normal function of the autonomic
nervous system. Xu et al. (1999) suggested that the phenotype in null
mice may be similar to that of the rare megacystis-microcolon-intestinal
hypoperistalsis syndrome (MMIH; 249210).

In a large genomewide association study, Thorgeirsson et al. (2008)
identified a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the CHRNA3 gene,
dbSNP rs1051730, that was highly associated with smoking quantity (see
188890) and with risk of lung cancer (LNCR2; 612052) and peripheral
arterial occlusive disease. The SNP dbSNP rs1051730 represents a
synonymous C/T transition in exon 5. Thorgeirsson et al. (2008)
concluded that their study demonstrated that a sequence variant
associated with nicotine dependence, a brain disorder, confers risk of
lung and cardiovascular diseases through an effect on behavior, which is
an example of active gene-environment correlation in the pathogenesis of
disease. The SNP dbSNP rs1051730 is in strong linkage disequilibrium
with a SNP in the CHRNA5 gene (118505.0001) (Hung et al., 2008;
Thorgeirsson et al., 2008).

To identify risk variants for nonsmall cell lung cancer, Amos et al.
(2008) conducted a multistage genomewide association study. In the
discovery phase, the authors analyzed 315,450 tagging SNPS in 1,154
current and former (ever) smoking cases of European ancestry with
nonsmall cell lung cancer versus 1,137 frequency-matched, ever-smoking
controls from Houston, Texas. For replication, Amos et al. (2008)
evaluated 10 SNPs most significantly associated with lung cancer in an
additional 711 cases and 632 controls from Texas and 2,013 cases and
3,062 controls from the UK. The authors found that the SNP dbSNP
rs1051730 was significantly associated with risk (combined P = 7.00 x
10(-18)).

;;U5 snRNP-SPECIFIC PROTEIN, 116-KD;;
U5-116KD;;
KIAA0031
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The EFTUD2 gene encodes U5-116kD, a highly conserved spliceosomal GTPase
(Fabrizio et al., 1997).

CLONING

The 4 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) particles U1, U2, U4/U6,
and U5 are mRNA splicing factors that contain 1 or more of the small
nuclear RNA (snRNA) components. The 20S U5 snRNP contains the common
proteins present in each particle (see 603541) as well as 9 specific
proteins with molecular weights ranging from 15 to 220 kD. By searching
sequence databases with the partial protein sequence of U5-116kD,
Fabrizio et al. (1997) determined that the KIAA0031 cDNA identified by
Nomura et al. (1994) encodes human U5-116kD. The predicted 972-amino
acid protein is structurally closely related to the eukaryotic
translation elongation factor EF2 (130610), sharing 27 to 50% sequence
identity depending on the region examined. U5-116kD contains consensus
GTPase motifs, and Fabrizio et al. (1997) showed that this protein bound
GTP specifically. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that U5-116kD
is located in the nucleus of HeLa cells and colocalizes with
snRNP-containing nuclear speckles. Antibodies against U5-116kD inhibited
pre-mRNA splicing in a HeLa nuclear extract. These authors also
identified homologs in S. cerevisiae, C. elegans, and mouse, designating
them Snu114p, Caeel-116H, and U5-116kD, respectively. Human U5-116kD
shares 32%, 74%, and 99% identity with Snu114p, Caeel-116H, and mouse
U5-116kD, respectively.

Gordon et al. (2012) performed in situ hybridization on cryosections of
mice at embryonic day 11.5 and observed strong Eftud2 expression in the
mesenchyme of limb buds and lung buds. Eftud2 expression was also noted
in the trachea and esophagus, mandibular mesenchyme, ventricular zone
cells of the forebrain, and the epithelium of the otic vesicle.

MAPPING

By analysis of somatic cell hybrids, Nomura et al. (1994) mapped the
EFTUD2 gene to chromosome 17.

GENE FUNCTION

Fabrizio et al. (1997) demonstrated that yeast Snu114p is essential for
cell viability and pre-mRNA splicing in vivo. A mutation in the putative
GTP-binding site of Snu114p was lethal. The authors concluded that the
GTP-binding domain of the U5-116kD protein plays an important role in
either the splicing process itself or the recycling of spliceosomal
snRNPs.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 12 unrelated patients with mandibulofacial dysostosis with
microcephaly (MFDGA; 610536), Lines et al. (2012) identified
heterozygous de novo mutations in or deletions involving the EFTUD2 gene
(see, e.g., 603892.0001-603892.0005). A range of mutations, including
deletions, frameshifts, splice site, nonsense, and missense mutations
were identified, consistent with haploinsufficiency as the disease
mechanism. The mutations were found by exome capture and high-throughput
sequencing of 4 unrelated affected individuals, followed by analysis of
EFTUD2 in 8 additional patients. The phenotype was characterized by
progressive microcephaly, midface and malar hypoplasia, micrognathia,
microtia, dysplastic ears, preauricular skin tags, global developmental
delay, and speech delay. A significant number of patients had major
sequelae, including choanal atresia resulting in respiratory
difficulties, conductive hearing loss, and cleft palate. MFDGA is the
first multiple malformation syndrome attributed to a defect of the major
spliceosome.

In a patient with features of the Nager type of acrofacial dysostosis
(AFD1; 154400) but who also exhibited microcephaly and was negative for
mutation in the SF3B4 gene (605593), Bernier et al. (2012) identified a
nonsense mutation in the EFTUD2 gene (603892.0006). Bernier et al.
(2012) suggested that the correct diagnosis in this patient was MFDGA.

Gordon et al. (2012) analyzed the EFTUD2 gene in 3 groups of patients:
17 cases with isolated esophageal atresia, 19 cases with
oculoauriculovertebral spectrum (OAVS; see 164210), and 14 patients with
mandibulofacial dysostosis and esophageal atresia and/or microcephaly.
No mutations were found in the first 2 groups, but 10 of the last group
had pathogenic EFTUD2 mutations (see, e.g., 603892.0007 and 603892.0008)
or deletions. Of the 10 patients with pathogenic EFTUD2 mutations, 8
presented with esophageal atresia as a component of the phenotype;
Gordon et al. (2012) concluded that esophageal atresia is an additional
malformation caused by heterozygous EFTUD2 loss-of-function mutations.
The authors noted that microcephaly might not be a consistent feature in
this syndrome and proposed designating the entity 'MFD Guion-Almeida
type.'

In a patient with MFDGA (610536), Lines et al. (2012) identified a
heterozygous de novo c.1910T-G transversion in the EFTUD2 gene,
resulting in a leu637-to-arg (L637R) substitution in a highly conserved

EFTUD2, HIS208ARG

In a 4-year-old patient with the Guion-Almeida type of mandibulofacial
dysostosis (610536), Gordon et al. (2012) identified a heterozygous de
novo c.623A-G transition in the EFTUD2 gene, resulting in a
his208-to-arg (H208R) substitution at a conserved residue within the
switch II region of the GTP-binding domain, a putative guanine exchange
factor interaction site. The mutation was not found in the dbSNP or 1000
Genomes Project databases. The patient presented with choanal atresia,
esophageal atresia, facial asymmetry, dysplastic ears, hearing loss,
agenesis of the lateral semicircular canals, postnatal microcephaly, and
delayed psychomotor development.

gestation due to the association of esophageal atresia and delayed
gyration and in whom dysplastic ears, microretrognathia, and
microcephaly with no brain formation were reported on necropsy (MFDGA;
610536), Gordon et al. (2012) identified heterozygosity for a 1-bp
deletion involving the donor splice site of intron 27 (c.2823+1del),
predicted to abolish splicing. The mutation, which was inherited from
the mother in whom it had arisen de novo, was 'absent from databases.'
Features in the mother included microcephaly, mixed hearing loss, mild
intellectual disability, and brachydactyly of fingers.

601982	TITLE *601982 8-@OXOGUANINE DNA GLYCOSYLASE; OGG1
;;8-@HYDROXYGUANINE DNA GLYCOSYLASE
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The major mutagenic base lesion in DNA caused by exposure to reactive
oxygen species is 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG). This damaged base is excised by
a DNA glycosylase with an associated lyase activity for chain cleavage.
Lu et al. (1997), Aburatani et al. (1997), Bjoras et al. (1997),
Rosenquist et al. (1997), Radicella et al. (1997), and Roldan-Arjona et
al. (1997) cloned human cDNAs with partial sequence homology to the
yeast 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (OGG1) gene. Radicella et al. (1997)
found that the predicted protein has 345 amino acids and a calculated
molecular mass of 39 kD. Roldan-Arjona et al. (1997), who called the
enzyme 8-hydroxyguanine DNA glycosylase, estimated their 424-amino acid
predicted human enzyme to have a size of 47 kD. They showed that it
releases free 8-hydroxyguanine from oxidized DNA and introduces a chain
break in a double-stranded oligonucleotide specifically at an
8-hydroxyguanine residue base-paired with cytosine. Expression of the
human protein in a DNA repair-deficient E. coli strain partly suppressed
its spontaneous mutator phenotype. Radicella et al. (1997) showed that
when the human coding sequence was expressed in a yeast strain mutant in
Ogg1, it was able to complement the spontaneous mutator phenotype. Arai
et al. (1997) also cloned the human OGG1 gene and, by Northern blotting,
showed that the gene is ubiquitously expressed in a variety of human
organs.

Rosenquist et al. (1997) cloned both the human and mouse OGG1 genes.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Roldan-Arjona et al. (1997) and
Radicella et al. (1997) mapped the human OGG1 gene to 3p25
(3p25.3-p25.2). By the same method, Arai et al. (1997) mapped the OGG1
gene to 3p26.2. By radiation hybrid analysis, Ishida et al. (1999)
mapped the gene to 3p26, proximal to the VHL gene (608537).

GENE FUNCTION

Rosenquist et al. (1997) showed that the mouse ogg1 gene product acts
efficiently on DNA duplexes in which 8-oxodeoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) is
paired with dC, acts weakly on duplexes in which 8-oxodG is paired with
dT or dG, and is inactive against duplexes in which 8-oxodG is paired
with dA. The human, mouse, and yeast OGG1 genes contain the
helix-hairpin-helix motif characteristic of a family of DNA glycosylases
(Rosenquist et al., 1997; Arai et al., 1997).

By confocal laser microscopy, Bjoras et al. (1997) showed that OGG1 is
localized in the nucleus.

By Northern blot analysis, Kuo and Sklar (1997) found that OGG1 is
expressed as 2.0- and 1.8-kb transcripts predominantly in germinal
center B cells and tonsil and to a lesser extent in other lymphoid
cells. In situ hybridization analysis indicated that OGG1 is most
abundantly expressed in the dark zones of germinal centers. The function
and localization of OGG1 suggest that it may play a role in somatic
hypermutation of immunoglobulin genes.

Kohno et al. (1998) demonstrated that multiple isoforms of the OGG1
protein are produced in human lung cells as a result of genetic
polymorphisms and alternative splicing of the OGG1 gene. They also found
frequent loss of heterozygosity at the OGG1 locus in primary lung tumors
and an intragenic mutation of the OGG1 gene in a lung cancer cell line.

Perillo et al. (2008) analyzed how H3 histone methylation and
demethylation control expression of estrogen-responsive genes and showed
that a DNA-bound estrogen receptor (see ESRA, 133430) directs
transcription by participating in bending chromatin to contact the RNA
polymerase II (see 180660) recruited to the promoter. This process is
driven by receptor-targeted demethylation of H3K9 (see 602810) at both
enhancer and promoter sites and is achieved by activation of resident
LSD1 (609132) demethylase. Localized demethylation produces hydrogen
peroxide, which modifies the surrounding DNA and recruits
8-oxoguanine-DNA glycosylase 1 and topoisomerase II-beta (126431),
triggering chromatin and DNA conformational changes that are essential
for estrogen-induced transcription. Perillo et al. (2008) concluded that
their data showed a strategy that uses controlled DNA damage and repair
to guide productive transcription.

GENE STRUCTURE

Tani et al. (1998) analyzed the genomic structure of the mouse Ogg1 gene
and showed that it maps to chromosome 6. It consists of 7 exons
approximately 6 kb long, and 2 DNA-binding motifs are encoded in exons 4
through 5.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Banerjee et al. (2005) used a covalent trapping strategy to capture
human OGG1 protein in the act of interrogating normal DNA. The x-ray
structure of the trapped complex features a target G nucleobase extruded
from the DNA helix but denied insertion into the lesion recognition
pocket of the enzyme. Free energy difference calculations showed that
both the attractive and repulsive interactions have an important role in
the preferential binding of 8-oxoG compared with G to the active site.
Banerjee et al. (2005) concluded that the structure reveals an effective
gate-keeping strategy for lesion discrimination and suggests a mechanism
for 8-oxoG insertion into the human OGG1 active site.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Audebert et al. (2000) analyzed 99 renal tumors for alterations in the
OGG1 gene to determine its association with tumorigenesis. Loss of
heterozygosity in the 3p25 region was found in 85% of the informative
cases. They detected somatic missense mutations of the OGG1 gene in 4 of
the 99 tumor samples. Biochemical analysis of the mutant proteins
demonstrated that an arg46-to-gln substitution (601982.0001) impaired
the enzymatic activity. The authors also described several polymorphisms
as well as aberrantly spliced OGG1 transcripts.

In an E. coli complementation assay, Kohno et al. (1998) found that the
DNA repair activity of the cys326 variant of OGG1 is lower than that of
the ser326 variant. Wang et al. (2006) examined the association of the
ser326-to-cys (S326C) variant with insulin sensitivity in 279
glucose-tolerant Taiwanese individuals with no history of cancer.
Individuals with the cys/cys genotype had significantly lower insulin
sensitivity levels compared with the ser/ser and ser/cys genotypes (p
less than 0.001 for both). Multiple linear regression analysis showed
that the cys/cys genotype was independently and significantly associated
with the degree of insulin resistance (p = 0.001).

Kovtun et al. (2007) demonstrated that the age-dependent somatic CAG
expansion associated with Huntington disease (143100) occurs in the
process of removing oxidized base lesions, and is remarkably dependent
on the single-base excision repair enzyme 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine-DNA
glycosylase (OGG1). Both in vivo and in vitro results supported a 'toxic
oxidation' model in which OGG1 initiates an escalating
oxidation-excision cycle that leads to progressive age-dependent
expansion. Kovtun et al. (2007) concluded that age-dependent CAG
expansion provides a direct molecular link between oxidative damage and
toxicity in postmitotic neurons through a DNA damage response, and
error-prone repair of single-strand breaks.

ANIMAL MODEL

Trapp et al. (2007) stated that Ogg1 deficiency in mice leads to
elevated basal levels of 7,8-dihydro-8-oxo-2-prime-deoxyguanosine
(8-oxoG) and increased spontaneous mutation frequency, although repair
of 8-oxoG is not completely abolished. To elucidate the role of CSB
(ERCC6; 609413) in preventing mutations caused by oxidative DNA base
damage, Trapp et al. (2007) generated mice deficient in Ogg1 (Ogg1 -/-),
Csb (Csb m/m, which have a truncating mutation), or both Csb and Ogg1
(Csb m/m Ogg1 -/-) that carried a nontranscribed bacterial lacI gene for
mutation analysis. The overall spontaneous mutation frequency in livers
of Csb m/m Ogg1 -/- mice were elevated compared with heterozygous
control mice and Ogg1 -/- mice. The additional mutations caused by Csb
m/m in the Ogg1 -/- background were mostly GC-to-TA transversions and
small deletions. For all mouse strains, the background levels of
oxidative purine modification in livers correlated linearly with the
number of GC-to-TA transversions. Trapp et al. (2007) concluded that CSB
inhibits spontaneous oxidative DNA base damage in nontranscribed genes.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, CLEAR CELL, SOMATIC
OGG1, ARG46GLN

In a clear cell renal cell carcinoma (144700), Audebert et al. (2000)
found a 445G-A transition in the OGG1 cDNA, predicted to result in an
arg46-to-gln (R46Q) amino acid change. They demonstrated that the DNA
glycosylase/AP lyase activity was drastically reduced in the case of
this mutant; its specific activity was 4-fold lower than that of the
corresponding wildtype version, suggesting a strong impairment in its
DNA repair capacity.

;;STROMELYSIN III; STMY3
DESCRIPTION The family of matrix metalloproteinases appears to be involved in
physiologic and pathologic processes associated with extracellular
matrix remodeling such as those that occur in embryonic development,
tissue repair, and tumor progression (Matrisian, 1990). Stromelysin III,
a member of this gene family, is overexpressed in the stromal cells of
invasive breast carcinomas but not in the stromal cells surrounding
benign breast fibroadenomas. By in situ hybridization, Levy et al.
(1992) assigned the STMY3 gene to 22q. Using a panel of somatic cell
hybrids containing different segments of 22q, they demonstrated that the
STMY3 gene is in band 22q11.2, in close proximity to the BCR gene
involved in chronic myeloid leukemia (151410). Both STMY1 (185250) and
STMY2 (185260) are located on chromosome 11. The members of the
metalloproteinase (MMP) family can be partitioned into 2 subfamilies,
according to their general structure and chromosomal localization. The
first group includes the 72-kD (120360) and the 92-kD (120361) type IV
collagenases, which are characterized by the presence of a
fibronectin-like domain and colocalize on chromosome 16. The second
group contains type I collagenase (120355) and stromelysins I and II,
which lack the fibronectin-like domain and colocalize on chromosome 11.
Based on the comparison of MMP gene structures, the 92-kD type IV
collagenase seems to represent the ancient gene from which the other MMP
genes evolved by loss of coding sequences (Tryggvason et al., 1990).
Because STMY3 is located on chromosome 22, it may be a member of a third
MMP subfamily.

Stromelysin III is also called matrix metalloproteinase-11, or MMP11.
The nomenclature of the matrix metalloproteinases, together with symbols
and EC numbers, was provided by Nagase et al. (1992).

Pei and Weiss (1995) identified stromelysin III as the first matrix
metalloproteinase that can be processed directly to its enzymatic active
form by an obligate intracellular proteolytic event that occurs within
the constitutive secretory pathway. Intracellular activation is
regulated by an unusual 10-amino acid insert located between the pro-
and catalytic-domains of stromelysin III which is encrypted with an
arg-X-arg-X-lys-arg recognition motif for the Golgi-associated
proteinase, furin (FUR; 136950) (a mammalian homolog of a yeast
pheromone convertase). Pei and Weiss (1995) suggested that the
furin-stromelysin III processing system could serve as an example of
proprotein convertases as potential targets for therapeutic intervention
in matrix-destructive disease states.

;;FRUCTOSE-1,6-BISPHOSPHATASE, LIVER;;
FRUCTOSE-1,6-DIPHOSPHATASE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Hepatic fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBP1; EC 3.1.3.11) catalyzes the
hydrolysis of fructose-1,6 bisphosphate to fructose-6-phosphate and
inorganic phosphate. This reaction is an important regulatory site of
gluconeogenesis.

See also muscle FBP (FBP2; 603027).

CLONING

El-Maghrabi et al. (1995) isolated clones corresponding to the FBP1 gene
from human placenta and leukocyte cDNA libraries. The deduced
362-residue protein shares 77% identity to FBP2 (Tillmann and Eschrich,
1998).

GENE STRUCTURE

El-Maghrabi et al. (1995) determined that the FBP1 gene contains 7 exons
and spans more than 31 kb; the 6 introns are in the same position as in
the rat gene.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, El-Maghrabi et al. (1995)
localized the FBP1 gene to chromosome 9q22.2-q22.3.

By physical mapping with FISH and by genetic mapping of an associated GA
repeat polymorphism, Rothschild et al. (1995) mapped the hepatic FBP
gene to 9q22.3. Amplification using FBP exon-specific primers with a YAC
contig from this region of chromosome 9 further refined the placement of
FBP genomic sequences to an approximately 1.7-cM flanked by D9S289 and
D9S287, near the gene for Fanconi anemia group C (227645).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In Japanese patients with FBP1 deficiency (229700), Kikawa et al. (1997)
identified homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the FBP1
gene (see, e.g., 611570.0001-611570.0004). The 1-bp insertion (960insG;
611570.0001) was the most common, present in 10 of 16 mutant alleles.

In a Japanese girl with FBP1 deficiency, Matsuura et al. (2002)
identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the FBP1 gene
(611570.0005; 611570.0006). Matsuura et al. (2002) stated that 11
different pathogenic FBP1 mutations had been reported.

HISTORY

By linkage analysis with highly informative linked markers, Rothschild
et al. (1995) excluded FBP as a candidate gene for maturity-onset
diabetes of the young (MODY) and noninsulin-dependent diabetes (NIDDM)
in both Caucasian and African American families.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
FRUCTOSE-1,6-BISPHOSPHATASE DEFICIENCY
FBP1, 1-BP INS, 960G

In a 10-year-old Japanese girl with fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase
deficiency (229700), Kikawa et al. (1995) identified a homozygous 1-bp
insertion (960insG) in exon 7 of the FBP1 gene. The insertion occurred
immediately following codon gly320 in the sequence of 5 Gs at nucleotide
region 957-961, and resulted in a truncated protein. The patient's
unaffected parents were heterozygous for the mutation. The patient had
experienced recurrent attacks of metabolic acidosis and hypoglycemia
since birth and had undetectable FBPase activity in leukocytes and a
liver sample. Although the mutation was not well conserved, expression
studies showed no FBPase activity.

Kikawa et al. (1997) identified the 1-bp insertion in 10 of 16 alleles
from additional Japanese patients with FBP1 deficiency.

FRUCTOSE-1,6-BISPHOSPHATASE DEFICIENCY
FBP1, GLY164SER

In Japanese patients with FBP1 deficiency (227900), Kikawa et al. (1997)
identified a 490G-A transition in exon 4 of the FBP1 gene, resulting in
a gly164-to-ser (G164S) substitution. In all patients, the mutation was
in compound heterozygosity with another pathogenic FBP1 mutation.

581T-C transition in exon 5 resulting in a phe194-to-ser (F194S)
substitution, and an 851C-G transversion in exon 7 resulting in a
pro284-to-arg (P284R; 611570.0006) substitution. Each unaffected parent
was heterozygous for 1 of the mutations.

600327	TITLE *600327 SYNAPTOTAGMIN 3; SYT3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Synaptotagmin-1 (SYT1; 185605), an integral membrane protein of synaptic
vesicles, is thought to be involved in calcium-dependent exocytosis of
synaptic vesicles. Mizuta et al. (1994) cloned a novel isoform of
synaptotagmin, designated synaptotagmin-3, from a rat brain cDNA library
and studied its tissue distribution. The protein contains 588 amino
acids having 40.5, 38.3, and 64.0% identity with rat synaptotagmin-1,
rat synaptotagmin-2 (SYT2; 600104), and a third synaptotagmin isoform of
the marine ray, respectively. The region of the 2 internal repeats
homologous to the regulatory domain of protein kinase C was highly
conserved among the 3 synaptotagmins. RNA blot studies demonstrated that
synaptotagmin-3 mRNA is expressed in brain, various endocrine tissues,
and hormone-secreting clonal cells. It appeared to be involved in
Ca(2+)-dependent exocytosis of secretory vesicles in endocrine cells, as
well as in neurons.

GENE FUNCTION

By in vitro characterization of recombinant rat Syt3, Li et al. (1995)
determined that Syt3 showed Ca(2+)-dependent binding to phospholipids,
Ca(2+)-dependent binding to syntaxins (see 186590), and
Ca(2+)-independent binding to adaptor protein-2 (see 601026).

MAPPING

Using an interspecific backcross DNA panel, Jones et al. (1995)
demonstrated that the mouse Syt3 gene is located on mouse chromosome 7;
no recombinants were observed between Syt3 and the kallikrein gene
family (Kal) in 94 meioses. To map human SYT3, they probed a Southern
blot containing genomic DNAs from a somatic cell mapping panel and found
segregation with chromosome 19. Thus, SYT3 appears to be located in the
conserved linkage group on proximal mouse chromosome 7 and human
chromosome 19q that is known to include at least 28 genes (Holdener et
al., 1993). Kwon et al. (1995) likewise mapped Syt3 to mouse chromosome
7.

606059	TITLE *606059 PROTEIN KINASE, cAMP-DEPENDENT CATALYTIC, INHIBITOR ALPHA; PKIA
DESCRIPTION cAMP-dependent protein kinases (see 601639) coordinate cellular
responses to hormones and neurotransmitters by altering processes such
as cell division, membrane permeability, and transcription. Protein
kinase inhibitor (PKI) proteins are specific and potent inhibitors of
the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinases.

CLONING

Using the mouse protein kinase inhibitor-alpha to screen a human
neuroblastoma cell line cDNA library, Olsen and Uhler (1991) isolated
clones encoding human PKIA. The deduced 75-amino acid PKIA protein
shares 100% and 97% sequence identity with the rabbit and mouse
homologs, respectively. Northern blot analysis detected major 4-kb and
minor 2-kb PKIA transcripts in skeletal muscle. Using kinase assays with
transfected COS cells, Olsen and Uhler (1991) verified that the PKIA
cDNA produces a heat-stable inhibitor of protein kinase. Protein
extracts inhibited both the alpha (601639) and beta (176892) isoforms of
the protein kinase catalytic subunit with equal efficacy. Using a
transcriptional activation system, Olsen and Uhler (1991) demonstrated
that elimination of a conserved alternative translation start site in
PKI increased the inhibitory activity of the PKI expression vector.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the PKIA
gene to chromosome 8 (TMAP WI-6959).

;;DIFF6
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Nottenburg et al. (1990) cloned mouse Sept1, which they called Diff6.
The deduced protein has a putative leucine zipper and a calculated
molecular mass of 43.5 kD.

Using full-length Aurora B kinase (AURKB; 604970) as bait in a yeast
2-hybrid screen of a fetal liver cDNA library, Qi et al. (2005) cloned
human SEPT1. SEPT1 belongs to a conserved family of GTPases.
Fluorescence-tagged SEPT1 localized to the midbody of HeLa cells during
cytokinesis, but it remained at the centrosomes and nearby microtubule
region throughout mitosis. It colocalized with Aurora B during
cytokinesis.

GENE FUNCTION

Using protein pull-down assays and coimmunoprecipitation of
epitope-tagged proteins, Qi et al. (2005) confirmed that SEPT1
interacted with Aurora B. Aurora B phosphorylated SEPT1 on ser248,
ser307, and ser315 in vitro.

MAPPING

Hartz (2009) mapped the SEPT1 gene to chromosome 16p11.2 based on an
alignment of the SEPT1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC012161) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.1).

609737	TITLE *609737 CRUMBS, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, 3; CRB3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By EST database searching for mammalian Crumbs family members (see CRB1,
604210), Makarova et al. (2003) identified and subsequently cloned CRB3
from human retina cDNA. The CRB3 cDNA encodes a deduced 120-amino acid
protein with a putative signal peptide in the first 20 amino acids, a
putative extracellular N-glycosylation site, and a transmembrane domain.
The intracellular domain contains a conserved band-4.1
superfamily-binding site and a Pals PDZ domain-binding site, as found in
Drosophila Crumbs and human CRB1. Makarova et al. (2003) also identified
mouse Crb3. The intracellular domains of the human and mouse proteins
are highly conserved. Using RT-PCR, Makarova et al. (2003) found high
levels of CRB3 mRNA in lung, kidney, retina, colon, and mammary gland,
and moderate levels in liver, spleen, pancreas, placenta, and prostate.
By Northern blot analysis of multiple human tissues, Lemmers et al.
(2004) demonstrated CRB3 expression in all epithelial tissues analyzed
and in skeletal muscle, with weak expression in brain.

GENE FUNCTION

From immunoprecipitation assays carried out with Madin Darby canine
kidney (MDCK) cell lysates, Makarova et al. (2003) showed that CRB3
binds with PALS1 (MMP5; 606958) and the PALS1-associated tight junction
protein, PATJ (see 603199). The PALS1 PDZ domain was found to be
necessary for CRB3 binding. Immunoprecipitation experiments showed that
CRB3 is N-glycosylated. Makarova et al. (2003) demonstrated that CRB3 is
localized to the apical surface and tight junctions of MDCK cells and
that this localization is not dependent on glycosylation.

Lemmers et al. (2004) demonstrated that the apical localization of CRB3
is not dependent on the PDZ-binding domain (ERLI). Lemmers et al. (2004)
found that expression of CRB3 or of a chimera containing the
extracellular domain of the neurotrophin receptor p75NTR (NGFR; 162010)
and the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of CRB3 led to a slower
development of functional tight junctions in MDCK cells. This phenotype
relied on the presence of the CRB3 PDZ-binding domain, which is involved
in a direct interaction with PAR6-alpha (PARD6A; 607484), a regulator of
epithelial polarity and tight junction formation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lemmers et al. (2004) determined that the CRB3 gene contains 4 exons,
with the last exon containing the 3-prime untranslated region.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the CRB3
gene to chromosome 19 (TMAP STS-N23258).

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

At least 3 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades exist in
mammals, each consisting of a 3-kinase module composed of a MAPK, a MAPK
kinase (MAPKK), and a MAPKK kinase (MAPKKK). JUN N-terminal kinases
(JNKs; see 601158) are MAPKs that stimulate transcriptional activity of
JUN (165160) in response to growth factors, proinflammatory cytokines,
and certain environmental stresses, such as ultraviolet light or osmotic
shock. MAP2K4 is a MAPKK that directly activates the JNKs, as well as
the related MAPK p38 (MAPK14; 600289) (Wu et al., 1997).

CLONING

By screening a human T-lymphocyte Jurkat cDNA library with a mouse cDNA
encoding Mma1-Sek1, a potential MAPKK, Lin et al. (1995) identified a
human homolog of Mma1-Sek1, which they named JNKK. The deduced 399-amino
acid JNKK protein shares more than 95% sequence similarity with
Mma1-Sek1 in the kinase domain. JNKK is also similar to S. cerevisiae
Pbs2.

GENE FUNCTION

One Ras-dependent protein kinase cascade leading from growth factor
receptors to the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) subgroup of
MAPKs is dependent on the protein kinase RAF1 (164760), which activates
the MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK) dual-specificity kinases. A second protein
kinase cascade leading to activation of the JNKs is dependent on MEK
kinase (MEKK). Lin et al. (1995) found that JNKK was a dual-specificity
kinase that activated JNK and functioned between MEKK and JNK. JNKK
activated the JNKs, but not the ERKs, and was unresponsive to RAF1 in
transfected HeLa cells. It also activated another MAPK, p38, whose
activity is regulated similarly to that of the JNKs. Lin et al. (1995)
also showed that human JNKK could partially complement Pbs2 deficiency
in yeast.

The stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) and MAPK pathways are signal
transduction cascades with distinct functions in mammals. White et al.
(1996) noted that they are structurally related in their phosphorylation
activity but differ in the events leading to phosphorylation. MAPKs are
rapidly phosphorylated and activated in response to various
extracellular stimuli. MAPK is regulated by its own phosphorylation by
MAPK kinases (MAP2Ks), e.g., MAP2K1 (176872) and MAP2K6 (601254). In the
SAPK pathway, SAPKs are the dominant JNKs activated in response to a
variety of cellular stresses, including treatment with interleukin-beta
(147720) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFA, or TNF; 191160). MAP2K4,
or SERK1, is a potent physiologic activator of SAPKs.

Wu et al. (1997) showed that JNKK1 was a specific activator of JNK1
(601158), JNK2 (602896), and p38, but not of ERK2 (176948). Among MEKK1
(600982), MEKK2 (MAP3K2; 609487), GCK, and ASK (MEKK5), MEKK1 was the
most potent activator of JNKK1, followed by MEKK2; GCK and ASK only
slightly activated JNKK1.

A virulence factor from Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, YopJ, is a 33-kD
protein that perturbs a multiplicity of signaling pathways. These
include inhibition of the ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK pathways and inhibition
of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa-B) pathway. The expression of
YopJ has been correlated with the induction of apoptosis by Yersinia.
Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen based on a LexA-YopJ fusion protein and a
HeLa cDNA library, Orth et al. (1999) identified mammalian binding
partners of YopJ. These included the fusion proteins of the GAL4
activation domain with MAPK kinases MKK1 (176872), MKK2 (601263), and
MKK4/SEK1. YopJ was found to bind directly to MKKs in vitro, including
MKK1, MKK3 (602315), MKK4, and MKK5 (602448). Binding of YopJ to the MKK
blocked both phosphorylation and subsequent activation of the MKKs.
These results explain the diverse activities of YopJ in inhibiting the
ERK, JNK, p38, and NF-kappa-B signaling pathways, preventing cytokine
synthesis and promoting apoptosis. YopJ-related proteins that are found
in a number of bacterial pathogens of animals and plants may function to
block MKKs so that host signaling responses can be modulated upon
infection.

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen, McDonald et al. (2000) identified JNK3
(602897) as a binding partner of beta-arrestin-2 (ARBB2; 107941). These
results were confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation from mouse brain
extracts and cotransfection in COS-7 cells. The upstream JNK activators
apoptosis signal-regulating kinase-1 (ASK1; 602448) and MKK4 were also
found in complex with ARBB2. Cellular transfection of ARBB2 caused
cytosolic retention of JNK3 and enhanced JNK3 phosphorylation stimulated
by ASK1. Moreover, stimulation of the angiotensin II type 1A receptor
(AGTR1; 106165) activated JNK3 and triggered the colocalization of ARBB2
and active JNK3 to intracellular vesicles. Thus, McDonald et al. (2000)
concluded that ARBB2 acts as a scaffold protein, which brings the
spatial distribution and activity of this MAPK module under the control
of a G protein-coupled receptor.

Kan et al. (2010) reported the identification of 2,576 somatic mutations
across approximately 1,800 megabases of DNA representing 1,507 coding
genes from 441 tumors comprising breast, lung, ovarian, and prostate
cancer types and subtypes. Integrated analysis of somatic mutations and
copy number alterations identified 35 significantly altered genes
including GNAS (see 139320), indicating an expanded role for G-alpha
subunits in multiple cancer types. Experimental analyses demonstrated
the functional roles of mutant GNAO1 (139311) and mutant MAP2K4 in
oncogenesis.

Toll-like receptors (TLRs; see 603030) play a critical role in the
initiation of immune responses against invading pathogens. Lai et al.
(2013) found that stimulation of mouse peritoneal macrophages with
various TLR ligands reduced expression of microRNA-92A (MIR92A; see
609422) and most Mir92a family members. Decreased Mir92a expression
enhanced TLR-associated signaling events by increasing activation of the
JNK pathway, thereby promoting production of proinflammatory cytokines,
such as Il6 (147620) and Tnfa. Luciferase and knockdown analyses showed
that Mir92a directly targeted mouse Mkk4 and reduced TLR-induced
inflammatory responses.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid mapping, Rampoldi et al. (1997) assigned genes
involved in the MAPK cascade to specific chromosomal sites, including
MEK4, which they mapped to chromosome 17p12.

White et al. (1996) mapped the human and mouse genes encoding MAP2K4,
which they called SERK1. The human gene was assigned to chromosome 17 by
PCR analysis of hamster/human somatic cell hybrids containing a single
human chromosome. White et al. (1996) stated that MAP2K4 localized to
chromosome 17p11 by fluorescence in situ hybridization. In mouse, they
mapped the Map2k4 gene to chromosome 11 by analysis of interspecific
backcrosses. The mouse gene maps to a region with extensive homology of
synteny to human chromosome 17p11.2.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Somatic Mutations in Pancreatic Cancer

Biankin et al. (2012) performed exome sequencing and copy number
analysis to define genomic aberrations in a prospectively accrued
clinical cohort of 142 patients with early (stage I and II) sporadic
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Detailed analysis of 99 informative
tumors identified substantial heterogeneity with 2,016 nonsilent
mutations and 1,628 copy number variations. Biankin et al. (2012)
defined 16 significantly mutated genes, reaffirming known mutations and
uncovering novel mutated genes including additional genes involved in
chromatin modification (EPC1, 610999 and ARID2, 609539), DNA damage
repair (ATM; 607585), and other mechanisms (ZIM2 (see 601483); MAP2K4;
NALCN, 611549; SLC16A4, 603878; and MAGEA6, 300176). Integrative
analysis with in vitro functional data and animal models provided
supportive evidence for potential roles for these genetic aberrations in
carcinogenesis. Pathway-based analysis of recurrently mutated genes
recapitulated clustering in core signaling pathways in pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma, and identified new mutated genes in each pathway.
Biankin et al. (2012) also identified frequent and diverse somatic
aberrations in genes described traditionally as embryonic regulators of
axon guidance, particularly SLIT/ROBO (see 603742) signaling, which was
also evident in murine Sleeping Beauty transposon-mediated somatic
mutagenesis models of pancreatic cancer, providing further supportive
evidence for the potential involvement of axon guidance genes in
pancreatic carcinogenesis.

ANIMAL MODEL

To define the role of SEK1 in vivo, Ganiatsas et al. (1998) studied
stress-induced signaling in embryonic stem and fibroblast cells
homozygous for an Sek1 knockout and evaluated the phenotype of Sek1 -/-
mouse embryos during development. Sek1-deficient embryonic stem cells
showed defects in stimulated SAPK phosphorylation but not in the
phosphorylation of p38 kinase. In contrast, Sek1-deficient fibroblasts
exhibited defects in both SAPK and p38 phosphorylation, demonstrating
that crosstalk exists between the stress-activated cascades. Tumor
necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1 (see 147760) stimulation of both
stress-activated cascades was severely affected in the Sek1-deficient
fibroblasts. Sek1 deficiency led to embryonic lethality after embryonic
day 12.5 and was associated with abnormal liver development. The
phenotype was similar to that of the Jun-null mouse embryos (165160) and
suggested that SEK1 is required for phosphorylation and activation of
JUN during organogenesis of the liver.

Using a forward genetic screen of C. elegans mutants, Kim et al. (2002)
showed that viable worms lacking esp2 and esp8, homologs of the
mammalian MAP kinases SEK1 and ASK1, were highly susceptible to and died
more rapidly from both a gram-negative bacterium, P. aeruginosa, and a
gram-positive organism, E. faecalis, than wildtype worms.
RNA-interference and biochemical analyses likewise implicated the p38
MAP kinase (MAPK14; 600289) homolog, pmk1, in susceptibility to these
pathogens. Kim et al. (2002) concluded that MAP kinase signaling, which
is also involved in plant pathogen resistance, is a conserved element in
innate metazoan immunity to diverse pathogens.

Wang et al. (2007) targeted Mkk4 deletion to the neural lineage in mice.
Homozygous mutant mice were indistinguishable from control littermates
at birth, but they stopped growing a few days later and died. Mutant
mice displayed severe neurologic defects, including misalignment of
Purkinje cells in cerebellum and delayed radial migration in cerebral
cortex. Decreased Jnk activity due to Mkk4 deficiency correlated with
impaired phosphorylation of a subset of Jnk substrates and with altered
gene expression.

Knockout of Fah (613871) causes liver failure in mice due to
accumulation of intermediary hepatotoxins generated during incomplete
tyrosine catabolism. Lethality can be prevented by continuous treatment
with the drug nitisinone (NTBC). Wuestefeld et al. (2013) coupled NTBC
withdrawal in Fah -/- mice with short hairpin RNAs to identify genes
that influence liver failure and regeneration. They found that stable
knockdown of Mkk4 robustly increased the regenerative capacity of
hepatocytes and reduced the number of apoptotic hepatocytes in Fah -/-
mice following NTBC withdrawal, as well as in mouse models of acute and
chronic liver failure. Inhibition of Mkk4 resulted in faster cell-cycle
entry and progression of hepatocytes during liver regeneration by
compensatory upregulation of Mkk7 (MAP2K7; 603014) and Jnk1-dependent
activation of Atf2 (123811) and Elk1 (311040). Inhibition of Jnk1, but
not Jnk2, abolished the proregenerative effect of Mkk4 knockdown.
Wuestefeld et al. (2013) concluded that MKK4 is a master regulator of
liver regeneration.

612991	TITLE *612991 ADDITIONAL SEX COMBS-LIKE 2; ASXL2
;;KIAA1685
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ASXL2 is a human homolog of the Drosophila asx gene. Drosophila asx is
an enhancer of trithorax (see 159555) and polycomb (see 610231) (ETP)
gene that encodes a chromatin protein with dual functions in
transcriptional activation and silencing (summary by Katoh and Katoh,
2003).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated human hippocampus
cDNA library, Nagase et al. (2000) obtained a partial ASXL2 clone, which
they designated KIAA1685. RT-PCR ELISA detected relatively low
expression in all adult and fetal tissues and specific adult brain
regions examined.

By searching databases for sequences similar to ASXL1 (612990), followed
by EST database analysis, Katoh and Katoh (2003) obtained a full-length
ASXL2 cDNA. The deduced 1,435-amino acid protein shares 29.8% identity
with ASXL1. ASXL1 and ASXL2 share significant homology in their
N-terminal and middle domains, which the authors designated the ASXN and
ASXM domains, respectively, and both proteins have a C-terminal plant
homeodomain (PHD). Katoh and Katoh (2003) also identified a putative
splice variant of mouse Asxl2, which encodes a protein with an in-frame
internal deletion of about 50 amino acids compared with full-length
human ASXL2.

Ramocki et al. (2003) stated that in situ hybridization of mouse Asxl2
demonstrated ubiquitous expression in the central nervous system from
embryonic day 9.5 to 15.5.

GENE STRUCTURE

Katoh and Katoh (2003) determined that the ASXL2 gene contains 13 coding
exons that span about 139 kb.

GENE FUNCTION

Using mouse and human cell lines, Park et al. (2011) showed that mouse
Asxl1 and human ASXL2 interacted with PPAR-alpha (PPARA; 170998) and
PPAR-gamma (PPARG; 601487) and played opposite roles in adipogenesis.
Asxl1 suppressed transactivation activity of ligand-bound PPAR-gamma and
blocked adipogenic differentiation in mouse 3T3-L1 cells, whereas ASXL2
promoted these activities. Mutation analysis revealed that the
heterochromatin protein-1 (HP1; see 604478)-binding domain of Asxl1 was
required for its repressive activity. Without the HP1-binding domain,
Asxl1 behaved like ASXL2 to promote PPAR-gamma activity and induce
adipogenesis. In chromatin immunoprecipitation assays in 3T3-L1 cells,
Asxl1 occupied the promoter of the endogenous PPAR-gamma target Ap2
(FABP4; 600434) together with the inhibitory factors HP1-alpha (CBX5;
604478) and lys9-methylated histone H3 (see 602810), whereas ASXL2
occupied the Ap2 promoter together with the activating factors histone
lysine N-methyltransferase MLL1 (159555) and lys9-acetylated and
lys4-methylated H3 histones. Microarray analysis showed that Asxl1
repressed, whereas ASXL2 increased, the expression of a subset of
adipogenic genes, most of which are PPAR-gamma targets. Park et al.
(2011) concluded that ASXL1 is a PPAR-gamma corepressor and that ASXK2
is a PPAR-gamma coactivator. They proposed that ASXL1 and ASXL2
fine-tune adipogenesis via differential regulation of PPAR-gamma.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Katoh and Katoh (2003) mapped the ASXL2
gene to chromosome 2p23.3, where it lies between the DNMT3A (602769) and
KIF3C (602845) genes. This region of chromosome 2p is paralogous with
the DNMT3B (602900)-ASXL1-KIF3B (603754) locus on chromosome 20q.

;;RDS, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF; RDS;;
PERIPHERIN, PHOTORECEPTOR TYPE;;
RETINAL DEGENERATION, SLOW, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

PRPH2 and ROM1 are tetraspanning membrane proteins that assemble into
noncovalent tetramers and higher order disulfide-linked oligomers and
are involved in photoreceptor disc morphogenesis (Loewen et al., 2001).

CLONING

- Human Gene

Using a probe derived from the coding region of the mouse rds cDNA to
screen a human retina cDNA library, Travis et al. (1991) isolated a
human RDS cDNA clone that encodes a putative 346-amino acid protein with
92% homology to the mouse protein. Four hydrophobic domains of 22 to 26
residues, as well as 2 possible sites for N-linked glycosylation, were
conserved between the human and mouse proteins. Northern blot analysis
detected 2 RDS transcripts of 3.0 and 5.5 kb in human retina. Dryja et
al. (1989) also determined that the human RDS protein shares 92%
homology to its murine analog.

- Mouse Gene

Mouse 'retinal degeneration, slow' (rds) is a phenotype characterized by
abnormal development of photoreceptor outer segments in the retina
followed by a slow degeneration of rods and cones, resembling the
abnormalities seen in human retinopathies. Using a subtractive cDNA
cloning strategy based on the hypothesis that the rds gene is normally
expressed in photoreceptors, Travis et al. (1989) isolated and cloned
the putative mouse gene for the disorder. The gene encodes a 346-amino
acid specific retinal protein with homology to the rod outer segment
protein-1 (ROM1; 180721). An insertion of 10 kb of foreign DNA into an
rds exon appeared to be responsible for the murine rds defect. The
peripherin that is mutant in rds of the mouse is a different protein
from the peripherin (Prph) encoded on mouse chromosome 15 (Pendleton et
al., 1991); see 170710.

Connell et al. (1991) reported that the amino acid sequence of the
bovine photoreceptor cell protein peripherin is 92.5% identical to the
sequence of the mouse protein encoded by the normal rds gene.

MAPPING

Demant et al. (1979) localized the rds mutation to mouse chromosome 17,
which was confirmed by Travis et al. (1989).

By analysis of DNA from a panel of human/hamster somatic cell hybrids
and by direct in situ hybridization, Travis et al. (1991) showed that
the human PRPH2 gene is located on the proximal portion of chromosome
6p.

GENE FUNCTION

Bascom et al. (1990) presented the results of experiments designed to
characterize the RDS gene product at molecular and ultrastructural
levels. Preliminary evidence showed that the RDS and ROM1 gene products
form a heterodimer in vivo using disulfide bonds. Using antibodies
against a synthetic peptide derived from the predicted protein sequence,
Travis et al. (1991) showed that the rds protein is a
membrane-associated glycoprotein restricted to photoreceptor outer
segment discs. It may function as an adhesion molecule involved in
stabilization and compaction of outer segment discs.

Connell et al. (1991) used monoclonal antibodies with Western blot
analysis to show that the peripherin protein deficient in the rds mutant
is normally localized to the rod outer segments and that it exists as 2
subunits linked by one or more disulfide bonds.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Travis and Hepler (1993) commented on the variety of phenotypically
different retinal disorders caused by mutation in the RDS gene. The
mutations seem to affect both rods and cones. Although some mutations
are accompanied by autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (RP7;
608133), others have the phenotype of macular dystrophy, retinitis
punctata albescens (136880), or patterned pigment dystrophy of the fovea
(169150).

In a large Irish pedigree with autosomal dominant retinitis
pigmentosa-7, Farrar et al. (1991) identified a 3-bp deletion in the RDS
gene (179605.0001), resulting in loss of one of a pair of highly
conserved cysteine residues in the predicted third transmembrane domain
of peripherin (codon 118 or 119). The deletion segregated with the
disease phenotype but was not present in unaffected individuals. Wells
et al. (1993) found the same mutation in another family with autosomal
dominant retinitis pigmentosa.

Wells et al. (1993) analyzed the PRPH2 gene in 13 probands with various
macular dystrophies and identified 2 heterozygous missense mutations at
codon 172 (R172Q, 179605.0006; R172W, 179605.0007) in affected members
of 3 families with macular dystrophy involving the central retina, or
central areolar choroidal dystrophy-2 (CACD2; 613105), respectively; the
authors also identified a heterozygous nonsense mutation (179605.0008)
in a woman with adult-onset vitelliform macular dystrophy (608161).

Kajiwara et al. (1994) demonstrated that retinitis pigmentosa can be
caused by digenic mutations (double heterozygosity): the leu185-to-pro
mutation in the RDS gene (179605.0004) in combination with a null
mutation of the ROM1 gene (180721.0001). Two-locus hypotheses have been
proposed as the mechanism for a number of disorders; this is one of the
first examples of molecular documentation. Nadeau (2001) reviewed
modifier genes in mice and humans. He considered the digenic inheritance
of RP in this instance to be an example of dominance modification, ROM1
being the modifier gene and RDS the target modifier gene. He cited
classic examples of dominance modification in mouse mutants.

In patients with patterned macular dystrophy, Nichols et al. (1993,
1993) and Kim et al. (1995) identified mutations in the RDS gene (see
179605.0009, 179605.0010, and 179605.0013).

In a Spanish family with central areolar choroidal dystrophy (CACD2),
Reig et al. (1995) identified the R172W mutation in the PRPH2 gene.

Hoyng et al. (1996) analyzed exon 1 of the PRPH2 gene in 7 families with
CACD2 and identified heterozygosity for an arg142-to-trp (R142W;
179605.0022) mutation in affected individuals from each family; in
contrast, no mutations were detected in 4 sporadic CACD patients after
complete screening of the PRPH2 gene.

Piguet et al. (1996) analyzed the PRPH2, rhodopsin (180380), and TIMP3
(188826) genes in a large Swiss pedigree segregating autosomal dominant
progressive macular dystrophy and identified heterozygosity for the
PRPH2 R172W mutation in affected individuals.

Payne et al. (1998) analyzed the PRPH2 gene in 300 British patients with
autosomal dominant macular dystrophies and identified mutations in 7.3%
of patients. The R172W mutation was found in 11 families, including 2
previously reported families (Wells et al., 1993 and Chopdar, 1993,
respectively). Payne et al. (1998) demonstrated a shared haplotype
consistent with a founder effect in the 11 R172W families, and noted
that although the families had been referred separately with various
diagnoses, including cone dystrophy, macular dystrophy, and CACD, review
of the clinical data indicated a common phenotype involving significant
loss of central vision, with a distinctive retinal appearance.

In 3 affected members of a Japanese family with sharply demarcated
progressive chorioretinal atrophy in the macular area, compatible with
CACD, Yanagihashi et al. (2003) identified heterozygosity for a novel
missense mutation in the PRPH2 gene (R195L; 179605.0021).

Boon et al. (2009) analyzed the PRPH2 gene in 103 Dutch CACD patients
and identified the R142W mutation in 98 patients from 45 different
families and the R172Q mutation in 5 affected family members from 1
family. The great majority of R142W-carrying CACD patients originated
from the southeast region of the Netherlands, and haplotype analysis
suggested a common founder mutation.

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

Keen and Inglehearn (1996) reported that a total of 43 sequence variants
had been described in the human RDS gene, including 30 missense
mutations, 2 single-base substitutions producing termination codons, 7
small in-frame deletions, and 4 insertion/deletion events that break the
reading frame. Of these, 39 were associated with retinal phenotypes that
could be grouped into 4 broad categories: dominant retinitis pigmentosa,
progressive macular degeneration, digenic RP, and pattern dystrophies.
The mutations underlying dominant RP and severe macular degeneration
were largely missense or small in-frame deletions in a large intradiscal
loop between the third and fourth transmembrane domains. In contrast,
the mutations associated with the milder patterned phenotypes or with
digenic RP were scattered more evenly through the gene and were often
nonsense mutations. Keen and Inglehearn (1996) stated that this
distinction supported the hypothesis that the large loop is an important
site of interaction between RDS molecules and other protein components
in the disc.

Kohl et al. (1997) screened 76 independent families with various forms
of mostly central retinal dystrophies for mutations in the RDS gene. Two
nonsense mutations, 5 missense mutations, and 1 single-base insertion
were detected. All of these were in heterozygous state. Kohl et al.
(1997) commented on the remarkable variation in phenotype and disease
expression between and within families.

Anand et al. (2009) analyzed total area of geographic atrophy and
age-related visual acuity data in patients with the R172Q, R172W, and
R142W mutations in the PRPH2 gene and observed a trend toward earlier
age at onset and worse visual acuity with the R172W mutation compared to
R142W or R172Q. Linear regression analysis showed that up to 60 years of
age, visual acuity with the R172W mutation was significantly worse than
that with the R142W (p less than 0.001) or R172Q (p = 0.04) mutations.
Anand et al. (2009) suggested that the visual prognosis associated with
variation in the PRPH2 gene may be mutation-specific and may be worse
with the R172W mutation compared to R142W or R172Q mutations.

ANIMAL MODEL

Ma et al. (1995) showed that the rds phenotype in mice is caused by an
insertion mutation of a 9.2-kb repetitive genomic element into exon 2 of
the rds gene that is very similar to the haplotype-specific element in
the H-2 complex. The entire element is included in the RNA products of
the mutant locus. Ma et al. (1995) presented evidence that rds in mice
represents a null allele.

A common feature of peripherin-related retinitis pigmentosa and macular
dystrophy in the human and the rds mutation in mouse is the loss of
photoreceptor function. It is characterized by complete failure to
develop photoreceptor discs and outer segments, downregulation of
rhodopsin (180380), and apoptotic loss of photoreceptor cells. Ali et
al. (2000) demonstrated that subretinal injection of recombinant
adeno-associated virus encoding a Prph2 transgene resulted in stable
generation of outer segment structures and formation of new stacks of
discs containing both peripherin-2 and rhodopsin, which in many cases
were morphologically similar to normal outer segments. Moreover, the
reestablishment of the structural integrity of the photoreceptor layer
resulted in electrophysiologic correction. These studies demonstrated
for the first time that a complex ultrastructural by in vivo gene
transfer. Sarra et al. (2001) extended the analysis and demonstrated
that the potential for ultrastructural improvement is dependent upon the
age at which animals are treated, but the effect of a single injection
on photoreceptor ultrastructure may be long-term. However, there was no
significant effect on photoreceptor cell loss, irrespective of the date
of administration, despite the improvements in morphology and function.
These findings suggested that successful gene therapy in patients with
photoreceptor defects may ultimately depend upon intervention in early
stages of disease and upon accurate control of transgene expression.

Kedzierski et al. (2001) conducted a series of transgenic/knockout mouse
experiments to determine whether the clinical observation of digenic RP
in humans could be corroborated in the mouse model; how the pathogenic
L185P (179605.0004) and P216L (179605.0003) D2-loop substitutions in RDS
affect the abundance of RDS protein; and what the correlation is between
disorganization of outer segment discs and photoreceptor degeneration in
the different mutant RDS alleles. Photoreceptor degeneration in the
mouse model of digenic RP was faster than in the wildtype and monogenic
controls by histologic, electroretinographic, and biochemical analysis.
A simple deficiency of RDS and ROM1 protein appeared to be the cause of
the photoreceptor degeneration in RDS-mediated RP. The critical
threshold for the combined abundance of RDS and ROM1 was approximately
60% of wildtype. Below this value, the extent of outer segment
disorganization resulted in clinically significant photoreceptor
degeneration.

McNally et al. (2002) introduced a targeted single-base deletion at
codon 307 of the rds-peripherin gene in mice, similar to a human
mutation reported by Apfelstedt-Sylla et al. (1995) (179605.0019).
Histopathologic and electroretinographic analysis indicated that the
retinopathy in mice heterozygous and homozygous for the codon 307
mutation appeared more severe than that in rds +/- and rds -/- mice,
suggesting that the rds-307 mutation may exert a dominant-negative
effect on the phenotype.

Li et al. (2003) identified the skate ortholog of mammalian
peripherin/rds. Conservation of most of the residues associated with
human retinal diseases indicated that these residues serve important
functional roles.

Ding et al. (2004) created transgenic mice bearing the R172W
(179605.0007) mutation in Rds. While mutant Rds was appropriately
localized, a direct correlation existed between transgene expression
levels and the onset/severity of the phenotype. In the wildtype
background, both structure and function of cone and rod photoreceptors
were significantly diminished, suggesting a dominant-negative cone-rod
defect. Whereas Rds heterozygous mice maintained normal cone function at
early ages, cone responses in R172W/Rds double-heterozygous mice were
diminished to 40% of the wildtype level, signifying a preferential
damaging effect of the mutation on cones. Conversely, R172W/Rds double
heterozygotes showed a significant rescue of rod function and
improvement of rod outer segment structure. Although Rds-null mice have
no detectable rod or cone responses, R172W-homozygous/Rds-null animals
retained 30% of wildtype structure and rod function, but no significant
rescue of cone function was detected at 1 month of age. Biochemical
abnormalities were not observed in complex formation and association
with ROM1 (180721); however, R172W protein was more sensitive to tryptic
digestion, indicative of a change in protein conformation, possibly
contributing to the cone-dominated phenotype.

Lee et al. (2006) studied trafficking of peripherin/rds and Rom1
(180721) in several knockout and transgenic animal models.
Peripherin/rds transport and localization were polarized to the site of
outer segment morphogenesis before disc formation in developing
photoreceptors. Peripherin/rds and Rom1 trafficking was maintained in
rhodopsin-knockout mice, suggesting that rim proteins and rhodopsin have
separate transport pathways. The presence of truncated
peripherin/rds-GFP in the outer segment supported previous evidence that
peripherin/rds mice form homotetramers for outer segment targeting. The
finding that Rom1 transports to the outer segment domain in rds mice
suggested that Rom1 may possess its own sorting and transport signals.

Chakraborty et al. (2009) showed that transgenic mice containing the Rds
C150S mutation (C150S-Rds) failed to form higher-order Rds oligomers,
although interactions between C150S-Rds and Rom1 occurred in rods, but
not in cones. C150S-Rds mice exhibited marked early-onset reductions in
cone function and abnormal outer segment structure. In contrast,
C150S-Rds expression in rods partly rescued the Rds +/- phenotype.
Although C150S-Rds was detected in the outer segments in rods and cones,
a substantial percentage of C150S-Rds and cone opsins were mislocalized
to different cellular compartments in cones. The apparent outer segment
structural differences between rods and cones may cause cones to be more
susceptible to the elimination of higher-order Rds/Rom1 oligomers (e.g.,
as mediated by mutation of the Rds C150 residue).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
RETINITIS PIGMENTOSA 7
PRPH2, CYS118DEL

In a large Irish pedigree with autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa-7
(608133), Farrar et al. (1991) identified a 3-bp deletion in the RDS
gene, resulting in loss of one of a pair of highly conserved cysteine
residues in the predicted third transmembrane domain of peripherin
(codon 118 or 119). The deletion segregated with the disease phenotype
but was not present in unaffected individuals. The deletion was absent
in 152 unrelated normal individuals and in 59 other autosomal dominant
RP families. The mutation was identified by single-strand conformation
polymorphism electrophoresis of PCR-amplified DNA. Wells et al. (1993)
found the same mutation in another family with autosomal dominant
retinitis pigmentosa.

.0002
RETINITIS PIGMENTOSA 7
PRPH2, PRO219DEL

By single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis (SSCP) of
PCR-amplified DNA sequences from the RDS gene, Kajiwara et al. (1991)
identified 3 mutations in the RDS gene in patients with autosomal
dominant retinitis pigmentosa-7 (608133). One mutation, found in a
single patient, was a 3-bp deletion that precisely eliminated codon 219,
which normally specifies proline.

.0003
RETINITIS PIGMENTOSA 7
PRPH2, PRO216LEU

In a single patient with autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa-7
(608133), Kajiwara et al. (1991) identified a mutation in the RDS gene,
resulting in a pro216-to-leu (P216L) change.

.0004
RETINITIS PIGMENTOSA 7, DIGENIC
PRPH2, LEU185PRO

In 2 unrelated patients with autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa
(608133), Kajiwara et al. (1991) identified a mutation in the RDS gene,
resulting in a leu185-to-pro change (L185P). The 3 mutations described
by Kajiwara et al. (1991) occurred in 2 unrelated patients from a set of
139 with autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa, all without a
rhodopsin mutation. Electroretinograms suggested that mutations in the
RDS gene affect both rods and cones. Kajiwara et al. (1994) demonstrated
that this mutation causes retinitis pigmentosa only when combined with a
null mutation of the ROM1 gene in double heterozygous state; see
180721.0001.

Loewen et al. (2001) showed that the L185P mutant self-assembled into
dimers that further associated through intermolecular disulfide bonds to
form tetramers but not higher order oligomers, which are characteristic
of wildtype peripherin-2. The L185P mutant, however, could interact with
wildtype ROM1 and wildtype peripherin-2 to form core tetramers and
higher order disulfide-linked oligomers.

.0005
RETINITIS PUNCTATA ALBESCENS, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
PRPH2, 2-BP DEL

In a 59-year-old man with advanced retinal degeneration involving the
macula and with peripheral subretinal flecks (retinitis punctata
albescens; see 136880), Kajiwara et al. (1992, 1993) identified a 2-bp
deletion in codon 25 of the RDS gene, leading to a premature stop codon
54 bases downstream. The predicted protein product, if expressed, would
contain only 42 amino acid residues rather than the normal 346. Of the
patient's immediate relatives available for testing, only his
33-year-old daughter carried the mutation. She had no relevant visual
symptoms but had funduscopic abnormalities, including attenuated vessels
and subretinal flecks, and ERG findings indicating progressive retinal
degeneration.

.0006
CHOROIDAL DYSTROPHY, CENTRAL AREOLAR 2
PRPH2, ARG172GLN

In 4 affected members of a family segregating autosomal dominant macular
dystrophy affecting the central retina (CACD2; 613105), Wells et al.
(1993) identified a G-to-A transition in the PRPH2 gene resulting in an
arg172-to-gln (R172Q). The patients described difficulty passing from
light to dark during their third or fourth decades, and visual acuity
progressively worsened between the ages of 36 and 56 years. They denied
night blindness or peripheral field loss. Ophthalmoscopic changes,
identified by 35 years of age, consisted of macular atrophy; the
peripheral fundus was normal.

Boon et al. (2009) identified the R172Q mutation in 5 affected members
of a Dutch family with CACD.

.0007
CHOROIDAL DYSTROPHY, CENTRAL AREOLAR 2
PRPH2, ARG172TRP

In affected members of 2 families segregating autosomal dominant macular
dystrophy affecting the central retina (CACD2; 613105), Wells et al.
(1993) identified heterozygosity for a C-to-T transition in the PRPH2
gene resulting in an arg172-to-trp (R172W) substitution. Typically,
affected persons became symptomatic in the third decade with blurred
central vision and photophobia; none complained of night blindness or
restricted peripheral visual fields. By 40 years of age, visual acuity
was less than 6/60, and funduscopic examination showed sharply
demarcated atrophy of the central retina, pigment epithelium, and
choriocapillaris.

Wroblewski et al. (1994) described in greater detail the clinical,
psychophysical, and ERG findings in the 2 families described by Wells et
al. (1993). All affected members of these families had a progressive
symmetric macular dystrophy. Symptoms of progressive central visual loss
developed in the third or fourth decade of life, accompanied by central
scotoma and well-demarcated atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium
and choriocapillaris of the macula. Studies revealed evidence of primary
cone dysfunction and preservation of peripheral rod function.

Reig et al. (1995) identified the R172W mutation in a Spanish family
with central areolar choroidal dystrophy. The mutation was also detected
in 2 asymptomatic family members who showed irregular pigmentation in
the retinal pigment epithelium.

Piguet et al. (1996) analyzed the PRPH2, rhodopsin (180380), and TIMP3
(188826) genes in a large Swiss pedigree segregating autosomal dominant
progressive macular dystrophy and identified heterozygosity for the
PRPH2 R172W mutation in affected individuals.

Payne et al. (1998) identified the R172W mutation in 11 British families
segregating autosomal dominant macular dystrophies, including 2
previously reported families (Wells et al., 1993 and Chopdar, 1993,
respectively). Analysis of microsatellite markers revealed a shared
haplotype that was absent in 50 population-matched controls, suggesting
a founder effect. Although the families had been referred separately
with a variety of diagnoses, Payne et al. (1998) stated that review of
the clinical data indicated a common phenotype involving significant
loss of central vision, with a distinctive retinal appearance.

.0008
VITELLIFORM MACULAR DYSTROPHY, ADULT-ONSET
PRPH2, TYR258TER

Wells et al. (1993) identified a nonsense mutation involving
tyrosine-258 (Y258X) in a woman with adult vitelliform macular dystrophy
(608161). Her father was deceased but the disorder was verified in him
by fundus photographs. The patient became aware of distorted left eye
central vision in her middle thirties. At 44 years of age, her visual
acuity was 6/6 with the right eye and 6/12 with the left. Fundus
examination was normal except for a small discrete yellow deposit at the
level of the retinal pigment epithelium centered in the fovea of each
eye.

.0009
MACULAR DYSTROPHY, PATTERNED
PRPH2, GLY167ASP

Nichols et al. (1993) studied a family in which 12 individuals in 3
generations had butterfly dystrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium
(169150). An extraordinary feature of the family was the occurrence of
16 sibs in the second generation, all apparently living. In the affected
individuals, a G-A transition was found in the RDS gene, resulting in a
gly167-to-asp (G167D) substitution

.0010
MACULAR DYSTROPHY, PATTERNED
PRPH2, 2-BP DEL, 1137TG

Nichols et al. (1993) described deletion of 2 basepairs overlapping
codons 299 and 300 in the RDS gene in affected members of a family with
butterfly-shaped pigment dystrophy of the fovea (169150). The TG
deletion began at nucleotide 1137 of their clone. All affected patients
demonstrated perifoveal deposits of yellow pigment at the level of the
retinal pigment epithelium.

.0011
RETINITIS PIGMENTOSA 7, WITH BULL'S-EYE MACULOPATHY
PRPH2, ASN244LYS

By nonradioisotopic SSCP analysis, Kikawa et al. (1994) identified an
asn244-to-lys (N244K) mutation in the RDS gene in a family with a form
of autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (608133). The phenotypic
expression associated with the N244K mutation showed striking
intrafamilial concordance. The features were night blindness, usually
noticed by the patient in the early teens; decreased visual acuity, with
an onset in the late thirties; diffuse pigmentary retinal degeneration
in the midperipheral to peripheral retina; and bull's-eye maculopathy,
which also appeared in the late thirties. ERG assessments showed almost
extinguished amplitudes of rod-isolated responses and severely reduced
amplitudes of cone-isolated responses beginning at about age 9 years,
even though the patient had no complaint of difficulty with night
vision.

.0012
FOVEOMACULAR DYSTROPHY, ADULT-ONSET, WITH CHOROIDAL NEOVASCULARIZATION
PRPH2, PRO210ARG

Gass (1974) reported an unusual foveomacular dystrophy characterized by
bilateral, subfoveal, vitelliform lesions between the ages of 30 and 50
years (608161). Choroidal neovascularization is a rare finding in this
entity, having been described in 2 of 33 patients (3 of 58 eyes)
examined by Vine and Schatz (1980) and in none of the 18 patients
covered in their literature review. Feist et al. (1994) described
another example of choroidal neovascularization in a man who was found
to have pro210-to-arg (P210R) change in the RDS gene. Jackson et al.
(1993) had reported the same P210R mutation in one of the original
foveomacular dystrophy patients of Gass (1974).

.0013
MACULAR DYSTROPHY, PATTERNED
PRPH2, 4-BP INS, CODON 140

Kim et al. (1995) studied a kindred with patterned dystrophy of the
retina (169150) with probable autosomal dominant inheritance, although
no male-to-male transmission was observed. They demonstrated a 4-bp
insertion at codon 140 of the peripherin/RDS gene.

.0014
VITELLIFORM MACULAR DYSTROPHY, ADULT-ONSET
PRPH2, MET1THR

To assess the frequency of peripherin/RDS mutations in the clinically
heterogeneous group of adult vitelliform macular dystrophy (608161),
Felbor et al. (1997) analyzed the entire coding region of the gene in 28
unrelated patients. They identified 5 novel mutations including 2
presumed null allele mutations. Thus, 18% of AVMD patients carried point
mutations in the RDS gene, suggesting that it is frequently involved in
the pathogenesis of this macular disorder. Felbor et al. (1997)
concluded that the variable phenotypes in AVMD are due, at least in
part, to genetic heterogeneity and are likely to be caused by mutations
in disease genes unknown up to that time. In a German patient who was 67
years old at last visit, Felbor et al. (1997) found that adult
vitelliform macular dystrophy was associated with a met1-to-thr (M1T)
amino acid substitution.

.0015
VITELLIFORM MACULAR DYSTROPHY, ADULT-ONSET
PRPH2, TRP316TER

In a German patient, aged 55 years, with adult vitelliform macular
dystrophy (608161), Felbor et al. (1997) identified a trp316-to-ter
(W316X) nonsense mutation in the RDS gene.

.0016
FOVEOMACULAR DYSTROPHY, ADULT-ONSET, WITH CHOROIDAL NEOVASCULARIZATION
PRPH2, 1-BP DEL, 112G

Yang et al. (2003) reported a family in which all 8 members affected
with adult-onset foveomacular dystrophy (see 608161) had a frameshift
null mutation, a 1-bp deletion at nucleotide 112 (112delG), in the RDS
gene that was associated with relatively severe manifestations.
Choroidal neovascularization developed in 2 patients, and geography
atrophy involved the macula in 3 patients.

.0017
RETINITIS PIGMENTOSA 7
MACULAR DYSTROPHY, PATTERNED, INCLUDED;;
FUNDUS FLAVIMACULATUS, INCLUDED
PRPH2, 3-BP DEL

Weleber et al. (1993) reported the occurrence of 3 separate phenotypes
within a single family with a 3-bp deletion of codon 153 or 154 of the
RDS gene. The mother presented at age 63 with adult-onset retinitis
pigmentosa (608133) that progressed dramatically over 12 years, with
marked loss of peripheral visual field. One daughter developed pattern
macular dystrophy (169150) at age 31 years. At age 44 years, her ERG was
moderately abnormal, but her clinical disease was limited to the macula.
Another daughter presented at age 42 years with macular degeneration;
over 10 years, she developed a clinical picture of fundus flavimaculatus
(see 248200). Her peripheral visual field was preserved but her ERG was
moderately abnormal. A son had onset of macular degeneration at age 44
years. Pericentral scotomas were present and ERG was markedly abnormal.

.0018
FUNDUS FLAVIMACULATUS
PRPH2, ARG46TER

Meins et al. (1993) identified an arg46-to-ter (R46X) mutation in exon 1
of the RDS gene in a 58-year-old German man who had been diagnosed with
Stargardt macular dystrophy at age 27 and received the diagnosis of
retinitis pigmentosa at age 47. Apfelstedt-Sylla et al. (1995) performed
mutation analysis in this patient and his 40-year-old son and found that
both had the R46X mutation. Although the son denied having any visual
problems, he was found on ophthalmologic examination to have multiple
yellow-white deposits varying in shape and size within the retinal
pigment epithelium layer and abnormal ERG findings. Apfelstedt-Sylla et
al. (1995) discussed the variation in the phenotypes of the father and
son and concluded that both patients displayed disparate manifestations
of fundus flavimaculatus (see 248200).

.0019
RETINITIS PIGMENTOSA 7
PRPH2, 1-BP DEL, 1160T

Gruning et al. (1994) identified a 1-bp deletion at codon 307 of the RDS
gene in a 68-year-old German woman with typical late-onset retinitis
pigmentosa (608133). The deletion resulted in a frameshift and a
premature stop codon after 16 triplets. The C terminus of the protein is
radically altered by this change, and an additional HaeII site is
created. The same patient was reported by Apfelstedt-Sylla et al.
(1995).

.0020
RETINITIS PIGMENTOSA 7
PRPH2, ASP173VAL

In 10 patients with retinitis pigmentosa-7 (608133) from a large
multigeneration Spanish family, Gruning et al. (1994) identified an
A-to-T transversion in the RDS gene, resulting in an asp173-to-val
(D173V) substitution. The patients ranged in age from 6 to 47 years and
showed typical signs of retinitis pigmentosa of variable severity.

.0021
CHOROIDAL DYSTROPHY, CENTRAL AREOLAR 2
PRPH2, ARG195LEU

In 3 affected members of a Japanese family with sharply demarcated
progressive chorioretinal atrophy in the macular area, compatible with
central areolar choroidal dystrophy (CACD2; 613105), Yanagihashi et al.
(2003) identified heterozygosity for a transversion in the PRPH2 gene,
resulting in an arg195-to-leu (R195L) substitution.

.0022
CHOROIDAL DYSTROPHY, CENTRAL AREOLAR 2
PRPH2, ARG142TRP

In 11 affected members from 7 families with central areolar choroidal
dystrophy (CACD2; 613105), Hoyng et al. (1996) identified heterozygosity
for a 664C-T transition in exon 1 of the PRPH2 gene, resulting in an
arg142-to-trp (R142W) substitution. The mutation was also detected in a
65-year-old female family member who had 20/20 visual acuity bilaterally
and no posterior pole abnormalities on ophthalmoscopy or fluorescein
angiography. The mutation was not found in 7 other unaffected family
members or in 200 control chromosomes.

Boon et al. (2009) identified the R142W mutation in 98 patients with
CACD from 45 different Dutch families and noted that 96 (98%) of the
patients originated from the southeast region of the Netherlands.
Analysis of CA repeat markers and SNPs near the PRPH2 gene in 3 large
families carrying the R142W mutation revealed an approximately 519-kb
shared chromosomal segment, strongly suggesting that R142W represents a
founder mutation. Carrier frequency of R142W was analyzed in 57
asymptomatic controls over 70 years of age from the same region of the
Netherlands; the mutation was found in a 76-year-old man who reported no
visual disturbances, but who was found to have early stage II CACD on
ophthalmoscopic examination and fundus autofluorescence imaging.

;;FXNA, RAT, HOMOLOG OF;;
KIAA1815
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2001) cloned a novel human cDNA, which they
designated KIAA1815.

By differential display in the neonatal rat ovary, Garcia-Rudaz et al.
(2007) identified a novel cDNA, termed Fxna (Felix-ina), expressed
during folliculogenesis. Northern blot analysis detected wide expression
of Fxna in rat tissues, with highest levels in ovary, kidney,
hypothalamus, and hippocampus. Sequence analysis showed that Fxna is a
member of the metallopeptidase family M28. It contains at least 8
transmembrane domains near the C terminus, suggesting that it is a
membrane protein, and a peptidase domain near the N terminus.
Transfection experiments in COS-7 cells localized Fxna to the
endoplasmic reticulum.

GENE FUNCTION

By in situ analysis of rat ovaries collected 48 hours after birth,
Garcia-Rudaz et al. (2007) showed that Fxna was expressed in granulosa
cells surrounding the oocytes but not in the oocytes themselves.
Down-regulation of the gene with a lentiviral siRNA disrupted both the
rate of follicle assembly and the initiation of follicle growth. There
was a widespread loss of somatic germ cell organization in which
pregranulosa cells encircled more than one oocyte and many oocytes were
not surrounded by somatic cells.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the ERMP1
gene to chromosome 9 (TMAP WI-15054). Scott (2007) mapped the ERMP1 gene
to chromosome 9p24 based on an alignment of the ERMP1 sequence (GenBank
GENBANK AK093217) with the genomic sequence (build 36.2).

603325	TITLE *603325 PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE 1, REGULATORY SUBUNIT 9B; PPP1R9B
;;PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE 1, REGULATORY SUBUNIT 9; PPP1R9;;
SPINOPHILIN; SPINO;;
NEURABIN II
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Spinophilin is a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase-1 catalytic
subunit (PP1; see 176875) and is highly enriched in dendritic spines,
specialized protrusions from dendritic shafts that receive most of the
excitatory input in the central nervous system (Allen et al., 1997).

CLONING

Allen et al. (1997) used a yeast 2-hybrid screen to identify neuronal
subunits from rat brain mRNA. They identified the spinophilin gene,
which encodes a predicted 817-amino acid protein with a PDZ domain and a
pI of 4.6. Northern blot analysis detected expression of a 4.6-kb
transcript in all tissues examined, but most abundantly in brain.
Because the protein displayed a distinct localization to the heads of
dendritic spines of neurons, Allen et al. (1997) named the protein
spinophilin. Spinophilin forms a complex with PP1 and modulates its
activity in vitro. Satoh et al. (1998) identified spinophilin in rats as
an F-actin-binding protein, which they designated neurabin II.

To identify proteins that interact with the ARF protein encoded by the
CDKN2A gene (see 600160), Vivo et al. (2001) used a yeast 2-hybrid
screen of a human brain cDNA library with an ARF fusion construct as
bait. By database searching with the identified clones, they
reconstructed a full-length cDNA of human spinophilin. The deduced
813-amino acid protein shares 95% sequence identity with the rat homolog
and contains an F-actin binding domain, a PP1C binding site, a PDZ
domain, and a myosin-like left-handed alpha helix.

GENE FUNCTION

Vivo et al. (2001) performed coimmunoprecipitation and transfection
experiments demonstrating that the C-terminal region of spinophilin
(amino acids 607-706) interacts with ARF in vitro and in mammalian
cells. Studies with deletion mutants showed that the first 65 amino
acids in the N terminus of ARF are necessary for this interaction.
Ectopic expression in different human and mouse cell lines showed that
spinophilin reduced the number of G418-resistant colonies with an
efficiency similar to or higher than that of ARF; this effect was
independent of the status of p53 (191170), Rb1 (614041), and ARF.
Coexpression of ARF/spinophilin in Saos-2 cells suggested synergistic
activity. Transfection experiments with COS-7 and NIH 3T3 cells
demonstrated that spinophilin localizes in the cytoplasm and in the
nucleus. These data suggested that spinophilin is involved in cell
growth.

Wang et al. (2004) reported that spinophilin antagonizes the multiple
arrestin functions associated with G protein-coupled receptor
(GPCR)-mediated signaling and trafficking. Through blocking G protein
receptor kinase-2 (GRK2; 109635) association with receptor-G-beta-gamma
complexes, spinophilin reduces arrestin-stabilized receptor
phosphorylation, receptor endocytosis, and the acceleration of
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity following endocytosis.
Spinophilin knockout mice were more sensitive than wildtype mice to
sedation elicited by stimulation of alpha-2 adrenergic receptors
(alpha-AR; see 104210), whereas arrestin-3 (301770) knockout mice were
more resistant, indicating that the signal-promoting, rather than the
signal-terminating, roles of arrestin are more important for certain
response pathways. Wang et al. (2004) concluded that reciprocal
interactions of GPCRs with spinophilin and arrestin represent a
regulatory mechanism for fine-tuning complex receptor-orchestrated cell
signaling and responses.

Wang et al. (2005) demonstrated that spinophilin, which binds the third
intracellular loop of several G protein-coupled receptors, also binds
the N-terminal domain of Rgs2 (600861), as well as other Rgs proteins.
When expressed in Xenopus oocytes, spinophilin increased Rgs2-mediated
inhibition of Ca(2+) signaling by the alpha-adrenergic receptor A
constitutively active alpha-AR mutant, with a mutation in the third
intracellular loop, did not bind spinophilin and was relatively
resistant to Rgs2-mediated inhibition.

Using immunoprecipitation, mass spectrometric, and Western blot
analyses, Sagara et al. (2009) found that neurabin II interacted with
ASEF2 (SPATA13; 613324) in human embryonic kidney cells. In response to
HGF (142409) treatment of HeLa cells, ASEF2, neurabin II, and APC
accumulated and colocalized in lamellipodia and membrane ruffles. RNA
interference experiments showed that ASEF2, neurabin II, and APC were
involved in HGF-induced cell migration. Furthermore, knockdown of
neurabin II resulted in suppression of ASEF2-induced filopodia
formation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Vivo et al. (2001) determined that the PPP1R9B gene contains 12 exons
spanning 15 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Vivo et al. (2001) mapped the PPP1R9B gene
to chromosome 17.

ANIMAL MODEL

By using spinophilin knockout mice, Feng et al. (2000) provided evidence
that spinophilin modulates both glutamatergic synaptic transmission and
dendritic morphology. Deletion of the spinophilin gene caused a marked
increase in spine density during development in vivo as well as altered
filopodial formation in cultured neurons. Thus, spinophilin appears to
be required for the regulation of the properties of dendritic spines.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ZBED proteins, such as ZBED1, originated from domesticated hAT DNA
transposons and encode regulatory proteins with diverse, fundamental
functions in vertebrates (Hayward et al., 2013).

CLONING

Nagase et al. (1998) cloned the ZBED1 gene, which they designated
KIAA0785, from an adult brain cDNA library, The transcript contains 2
repetitive elements in its 3-prime end and encodes a deduced 694-amino
acid protein. RT-PCR ELISA detected high expression in brain, lung, and
ovary, moderate expression in heart, liver, kidney, pancreas, spleen,
and testis, and low expression in skeletal muscle.

In a search for genes that escape X inactivation, Esposito et al. (1999)
identified ZBED1, which they called TRAMP, as a pseudoautosomal gene
with a functional homolog on the Y chromosome. By PCR of teratocarcinoma
cell line cDNA libraries, they obtained a full-length TRAMP cDNA. The
putative 694-amino acid TRAMP protein shares sequence similarity with
transposases of the Ac family. Moreover, TRAMP shares similarity with
Drosophila Dref, a transcriptional regulatory factor that specifically
binds the promoter-activating element DNA replication-related element
(DRE) of DNA replication-related genes. Northern blot analysis detected
a 5-kb TRAMP transcript in all human tissues examined, with highest
levels in skeletal muscle and heart. RT-PCR confirmed that TRAMP escapes
X inactivation. Esposito et al. (1999) identified putative terminal
inverted repeats (TIRs) and a duplicate target site flanking the TRAMP
gene, suggesting that it is part of an ancient transposable element.
However, the nucleotide differences in these sites and the TIR-binding
inactivity of the putative TRAMP protein suggested that this element is
not an autonomous transposon.

Yamashita et al. (2007) determined that ZBED1, which they called DREF,
contains an N-terminal BED domain and a C-terminal hATC dimerization
domain. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that endogenous DREF
localized to nuclei of HeLa cells during interphase, but it was absent
from condensed chromosomes during mitosis.

Hayward et al. (2013) stated that the 694-amino acid ZBED1 protein has
an N-terminal zinc finger BED domain, named after the domesticated
Drosophila proteins Beaf and Dref, and a C-terminal catalytic domain.
The catalytic domain contains an alpha-helical region, a hAT-type
dimerization motif, and a predicted catalytic DDE motif similar to that
found in the catalytic pockets of integrases of retroviruses and long
terminal repeat retrotransposons.

GENE FUNCTION

Ohshima et al. (2003) demonstrated that human DREF bound DNA with the
consensus sequence 5-prime-TGTCG(C/T)GA(T/C)A. They identified
DREF-binding sequences in the promoter regions of several genes related
to cell proliferation, and they demonstrated that DREF bound and
activated the histone H1 (see 142711) promoter. DREF expression was low
in serum-deprived normal human fibroblasts, but it was induced by serum
and reached a maximum during S phase. RNA interference experiments
targeting DREF inhibited S-phase entry and reduced histone H1 mRNA in
HeLa cells. Ohshima et al. (2003) concluded that DREF has a role in
regulating genes related to cell proliferation.

Using protein pull-down assays, crosslinking, and immunoprecipitation
analysis, Yamashita et al. (2007) showed that the isolated hACT domain
of human DREF and full-length DREF formed dimers, and that DREF mutants
lacking the hATC domain did not dimerize. Point mutations within the
hATC domain revealed that the conserved hydrophobic amino acids trp590,
trp591, and leu601 were critical for DREF self-association. The hATC
domain was also required for efficient nuclear accumulation of DREF via
importin beta-1 (KPNB1; 602738). A cluster of basic amino acids outside
the hATC domain was also necessary for DREF nuclear targeting. EMSA
revealed that the DREF N-terminal domain mediated DNA binding.

GENE STRUCTURE

Esposito et al. (1999) determined that ZBED1 is a single-exon gene.

MAPPING

By Southern blot analysis, Esposito et al. (1999) mapped the TRAMP gene
to chromosome Xp22.33. Using YAC contigs, they localized the gene 350 to
450 kb distal from the boundary of PAR1.

EVOLUTION

Hayward et al. (2013) found that ZBED genes originated from at least 2
independent hAT DNA transposon domestication events in ancestors of
primitive jawed vertebrates, since no orthologs of ZBEDs were identified
in jawless fish or more primitive vertebrates. ZBED1 belongs to the Ac
family of domesticated hAT DNA transposons, which also includes ZBED2
(615246), ZBED3 (615250), ZBED4 (612552), and ZBED6 (613512).

601633	TITLE *601633 N-ETHYLMALEIMIDE-SENSITIVE FACTOR; NSF
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Mammalian N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive protein was first described by
Glick and Rothman (1987) as the protein that restored the ability of
Golgi membranes that had been inactivated with the reagent
N-ethylmaleimide to re-engage in vesicular transport. The NSF gene was
subsequently cloned from Chinese hamster cells by Block et al. (1988)
and Wilson et al. (1989). NSF is a member of the AAA (ATPases associated
with diverse cellular activities) gene family. Hoyle et al. (1996)
stated that the genes are most related throughout the approximately
200-amino acid domain (the AAA domain) that binds ATP; however, the
family is notable not only for its conservation but also for diverse
functions of its proteins in eukaryotic cells. The family can be
subdivided into those with either 1 or 2 ATP-binding domains. NSF is a
2-domain member of the AAA family. Valosin-containing protein (601023),
which is also involved in membrane fusion, is another 2-AAA domain
protein.

GENE FUNCTION

The process of vesicle targeting and fusion in the secretory and
endocytic pathways has been described by the SNAREs hypothesis (Rothman,
1994). This proposes that vesicles dock with specific target membranes
by binding to membrane-specific SNAREs (soluble
N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factors attachment protein receptors) (see
604026). Hoyle et al. (1996) noted that targeting specificity is also
affected by the Rabs, a group of small soluble GTPases. After the
vesicle has bound to the target membrane, the SNARE multimer is joined
by the soluble SNAP proteins and N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor
(NSF). The resulting large complex is thought to allow membrane fusion
and the ATPase activity of the NSF appears to be essential for the
process. Hoyle et al. (1996) stated that while many of different SNAREs,
Rabs, and SNAPs are involved in membrane fusion, there is only 1 NSF,
and the SNARE hypothesis describes NSF-dependent fusion.

By use of microarray expression profiling of prefrontal cortex from
matched pairs of patients with schizophrenia (181500) and control
subjects and hierarchical data analysis, Mirnics et al. (2000) found
that transcripts encoding proteins involved in the regulation of
presynaptic function were decreased in all subjects with schizophrenia.
Genes of presynaptic function showed a different combination of
decreased expression across subjects. Over 250 other gene groups did not
show altered expression. Selected presynaptic function gene microarray
observations were verified by in situ hybridization. Two of the most
consistently changed transcripts in the presynaptic functional gene
group, N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor and synapsin-2 (600755), were
decreased in 10 of 10 and 9 of 10 subjects with schizophrenia,
respectively. The combined data suggested that subjects with
schizophrenia share a common abnormality in presynaptic function.

MAPPING

By PCR amplification in a human monochromosomal somatic cell hybrid
mapping panel, Hoyle et al. (1996) mapped the NSF gene to human
chromosome 17. To determine a regional mapping position for NSF and to
confirm their cell hybrid results, they isolated NSF-containing human
cosmids for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) mapping. The
results showed that the gene mapped to 17q21-q22. They mapped the mouse
homolog, Nsf, to mouse chromosome 11 by analysis of DNA from
interspecific backcrosses. Hoyle et al. (1996) noted that there are
neurologic disorders mapping in that region of chromosome 17, such as
DDBAC (600274) and PPND (600274), which may be allelic disorders. They
noted that NSF is preferentially expressed in the mammalian nervous
system. An aberrant Nsf gene in Drosophila results in defective synaptic
transmission.

602238	TITLE *602238 EXOSOME COMPONENT 2; EXOSC2
;;RIBOSOMAL RNA-PROCESSING PROTEIN 4, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; RRP4
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Mitchell et al. (1997) cloned the human homolog of the yeast gene rrp4p
(Mitchell et al., 1996). The protein encoded by this gene is required
for a 3-prime to 5-prime exonuclease activity that generates the 3-prime
end of the 5.8S rRNA. The yeast protein, as well as its human homolog,
is only 1 enzymatic subunit of a multienzyme ribonuclease complex that
Mitchell et al. (1997) referred to as the 'exosome.' The human protein
is 43% identical to the yeast protein. Expression of the human RRP4 gene
in yeast complemented the mutation in the rrp4.1 strain.

Inherently unstable mammalian mRNAs contain AU-rich elements (AREs)
within their 3-prime untranslated regions. In yeast, 3-prime-to-5-prime
mRNA degradation is mediated by the exosome, a multisubunit particle.
Chen et al. (2001) purified and characterized the human exosome by mass
spectrometry and found its composition to be similar to its yeast
counterpart. They identified the following protein subunits within the
human exosome: p7, which is homologous to the yeast Rrp4 protein; p8,
which is homologous to the yeast Rrp42 protein (606488); p9, which is
homologous to the yeast Rrp43 protein (OIP2; 606019); p10, which is
homologous to the yeast Rrp40 protein (606489); p11, which is homologous
to the yeast Mtr3 protein (606490); p12A, which is homologous to the
yeast Rrp41 protein (606491); p12B, which is homologous to the yeast
Rrp46 protein (606492); and p13, which is homologous to the yeast Csl4
protein (606493). They also identified 2 exosome-associated factors, p1
(600478) and p14 (MPP6; 605500), that were not homologous to any yeast
exosome components.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a cell-free RNA decay system, Chen et al. (2001) demonstrated that
the mammalian exosome is required for rapid degradation of
ARE-containing RNAs but not for poly(A) shortening. They found that the
mammalian exosome does not recognize ARE-containing RNAs on its own. ARE
recognition required certain ARE-binding proteins that could interact
with the exosome and recruit it to unstable RNAs, thereby promoting
their rapid degradation.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Hall et al. (1990) isolated a novel human brain cDNA sequence encoding
n-chimerin, a 34-kD protein. They found that the N-terminal half shared
almost 50% identity with sequences in the regulatory domain of protein
kinase C (176960); the C-terminal half had 42% identity with the
C-terminal region of BCR, the product of the breakpoint cluster region
gene involved in the Philadelphia chromosome translocation (151410).

Also known as alpha-1-chimerin, n-chimerin is a brain GTPase-activating
protein (GAP) for the RAS-related p21 (RAC). Hall et al. (1993) found
another form of chimerin, termed alpha-2-chimerin, and showed that it is
the product of an alternately spliced transcript of the human n-chimerin
gene. The mRNAs corresponding to the 2 forms of chimerin were expressed
differently.

GENE FUNCTION

By Western blot analysis of mouse hippocampal lysates, Buttery et al.
(2006) found alpha-1-chimerin levels slowly increased during the first 2
weeks of postnatal development. Highest expression was in neurons of the
hippocampus and cortex, as well as Purkinje cells in the cerebellum.
Cultured hippocampal neurons also showed a developmental increase in
alpha-1-chimerin, and expression was highly sensitive to synaptic
activity inhibitors. Stimulation of phospholipase C-beta (PLCB; see
607120)-coupled receptors recruited alpha-1-chimerin to the plasma
membrane of cultured hippocampal neurons, and increased alpha-1-chimerin
activity resulted in the pruning of dendritic spines and branches, which
required both the diacylglycerol-binding and Rac GAP activity of
alpha-1-chimerin. Suppression of alpha-1-chimerin resulted in increased
process growth from the dendritic shaft and from spine heads. Buttery et
al. (2006) concluded that alpha-1-chimerin is an activity-dependent Rho
GTPase regulator that is activated by PLCB-coupled cell surface
receptors.

Ephrins and their receptors play critical roles in axon guidance and
growth cone collapse by regulating small Rho GTPases. Shi et al. (2007)
showed that alpha-2-chimerin was required for Epha4 (602188)-dependent
growth cone collapse. Prominent expression of alpha-2-chimerin was
detected in rat brain and cortical neurons and was enriched in
postsynaptic density fractions. The SH2 domain of alpha-2-chimerin
interacted specifically with Epha4 in rat brain in a kinase-dependent
manner. Ephrin-A1 (EFNA1; 191164)-stimulated activation of Epha4
resulted in phosphorylation of alpha-2-chimerin and increased
alpha-2-chimerin GAP activity toward Rac1 (602048), which was required
for Epha4-dependent growth cone collapse.

MAPPING

Hall et al. (1993) mapped the human n-chimerin gene to chromosome
2q31-q32.1 by Southern analysis of a hybrid cell DNA panel and by
fluorescence in situ hybridization.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Miyake et al. (2008) found 7 missense mutations in the CHN1 gene
(118423.0001-118423.0007) resulting in Duane retraction syndrome-2
(DURS2; 604356). These gain-of-function mutations increased
alpha-2-chimerin RacGAP activity in vitro. Several mutations appeared to
enhance alpha-2-chimerin translocation to the cell membrane or enhanced
its ability to self-associate. Expression of mutant alpha-2-chimerin
constructs in chick embryos resulted in failure of oculomotor axons to
innervate their target extraocular muscles. Miyake et al. (2008)
concluded that alpha-2-chimerin has a critical developmental function in
ocular motor axon pathfinding. Five of the 7 mutations resulted in
nonconservative amino acid substitutions. All were predicted to alter
amino acids that are conserved in 8 different species. All 7 nucleotide
substitutions cosegregated with the affected haplotypes, and none were
present in online SNP databases or on 788 control chromosomes.

In affected members of 2 families segregating DURS2 as a dominant trait,
Chan et al. (2011) identified heterozygous missense mutations in the
CHN1 gene (118423.0008-118423.0009). Both mutations altered residues
that participate in intramolecular interactions that stabilize the
inactive, closed conformation of alpha-2-chimerin and are thus predicted
to result in its hyperactivation.

609092	TITLE *609092 F-BOX ONLY PROTEIN 10; FBXO10
;;FBX10
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the F-box protein family, such as FBXO10, are characterized
by an approximately 40-amino acid F-box motif. SCF complexes, formed by
SKP1 (601434), cullin (see CUL1; 603134), and F-box proteins, act as
protein-ubiquitin ligases. F-box proteins interact with SKP1 through the
F box, and they interact with ubiquitination targets through other
protein interaction domains (Jin et al., 2004).

CLONING

Jin et al. (2004) reported that the FBXO10 protein contains a central F
box and a C-terminal CASH domain, which is found in carbohydrate-binding
proteins and sugar hydrolases.

MAPPING

Jin et al. (2004) stated that the FBXO10 gene maps to chromosome 9p13.1
and the mouse Fbxo10 gene maps to chromosome 4B1.

603816	TITLE *603816 AXIS INHIBITOR 1; AXIN1
;;AXIN;;
FUSED, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

During embryonic development and tissue homeostasis in adults, the Wnt
(see 164820)-beta-catenin (CTNNB1; 116806) signaling pathway modulates
cellular differentiation, proliferation, movement, and polarity. AXIN1
has both positive and negative regulatory roles in Wnt-beta-catenin
signaling. AXIN1 is a core component of a 'destruction complex' that
promotes phosphorylation and polyubiquitination of cytoplasmic
beta-catenin, resulting in beta-catenin proteasomal degradation in the
absence of Wnt signaling. Nuclear accumulation of AXIN1 can positively
influence beta-catenin-mediated transcription during Wnt signaling (Lui
et al., 2011).

CLONING

In the vertebrate embryo, the formation of the dorsal-ventral axis
depends on the activity of the Wnt signaling pathway (see 164820).
Mutations in the mouse gene 'fused' (fu) cause axis duplication in
homozygous mouse embryos. Zeng et al. (1997) renamed the fu gene 'axin'
to distinguish it from the unrelated Drosophila 'fused' gene, and cloned
mouse and human axin cDNAs. The human AXIN gene encodes a 900-amino acid
polypeptide with 87% identity to the mouse protein. Although the
sequence contains a bipartite nuclear localization signal, Zeng et al.
(1997) did not find that the protein was localized to the nucleus. The
sequence also contains a regulator of G protein signaling domain (RGS;
see 602189) and a C-terminal region with homology to a conserved
sequence near the N terminus of Drosophila and vertebrate 'dishevelled'
proteins (see 601365).

GENE FUNCTION

Zeng et al. (1997) found that injection of axin mRNA into frog embryos
inhibited dorsal axis formation, apparently by interfering with
signaling through the Wnt pathway.

The WNT signaling pathway is essential for development and
organogenesis. WNT signaling stabilizes beta-catenin (CTNNB1; 116806),
which accumulates in the cytoplasm, binds to T-cell factor, also known
as lymphoid enhancer-binding factor-1 (LEF1; 153245), and then
upregulates downstream genes. Mutations in CTNNB1 or APC (611731) occur
in human neoplasms including colon cancers and hepatocellular carcinomas
(HCC; 114550). Because hepatocellular carcinomas tend to show
accumulation of beta-catenin more often than mutations in CTNNB1, Satoh
et al. (2000) looked for mutations in AXIN1, which encodes a key factor
for WNT signaling, in 6 HCC cell lines and 100 primary HCCs. Among the 4
cell lines and 87 HCCs in which they did not detect CTNNB1 mutations,
they identified AXIN1 mutations in 3 cell lines and 6 mutations in 5 of
the primary HCCs. In cell lines containing mutations in either gene,
they observed increased DNA binding of T-cell factor associated with
beta-catenin in nuclei. Adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of wildtype
AXIN1 induced apoptosis in hepatocellular and colorectal cancer cells
that had accumulated beta-catenin as a consequence of either APC,
CTNNB1, or AXIN1 mutation, suggested that axin may be an effective
therapeutic molecule for suppressing growth of hepatocellular and
colorectal cancers.

To investigate whether the '2-hit' mutation of AXIN1 occurred in 5
primary HCCs in which AXIN1 mutations were found, Satoh et al. (2000)
examined loss of heterozygosity (LOH) using 2 polymorphic markers and
found LOH in 3 tumors, indicating that AXIN1 is likely to function as a
tumor suppressor. All of the AXIN1 mutations detected in hepatoma cell
lines and primary HCCs predicted truncated proteins lacking the binding
site for beta-catenin; hence, these products would lack the ability to
form complexes with beta-catenin, which would thus not be degraded
properly.

To understand how the WNT coreceptor LRP5 (603506) is involved in
transducing the canonical WNT signals, Mao et al. (2001) identified axin
as a protein that interacts with the intracellular domain of LRP5. LRP5,
when expressed in fibroblast cells, showed no effect on the canonical
WNT signaling pathway by itself, but acted synergistically with WNT. In
contrast, LRP5 mutants lacking the extracellular domain functioned as
constitutively active forms that bound axin and that induced LEF1
activation by destabilizing axin and stabilizing beta-catenin. Addition
of WNT caused the translocation of axin to the membrane and enhanced the
interaction between axin and LRP5. In addition, the LRP5 sequences
involved in interactions with axin were found to be required for LEF1
activation. The authors concluded that the binding of axin to LRP5 is an
important part of the WNT signal transduction pathway. In Rat1 and P19
cells, Chen et al. (2006) found that Macf1 (608271) interacted directly
with Axin and translocated with the Axin complex to the cell membrane
upon Wnt stimulation.

Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) have the ability to renew themselves and
to give rise to all lineages of the blood. Reya et al. (2003) showed
that the WNT signaling pathway has an important role in this process.
Overexpression of activated beta-catenin expands the pool of HSCs in
long-term cultures by both phenotype and function. Furthermore, HSCs in
their normal microenvironment activate a LEF1/TCF reporter, which
indicates that HSCs respond to WNT signaling in vivo. To demonstrate the
physiologic significance of this pathway for HSC proliferation, Reya et
al. (2003) showed that the ectopic expression of axin or a frizzled
(603408) ligand-binding domain, inhibitors of the WNT signaling pathway,
led to inhibition of HSC growth in vitro and reduced reconstitution in
vivo. Furthermore, activation of WNT signaling in HSCs induced increased
expression of HOXB4 (142965) and NOTCH1 (190198), genes previously
implicated in self-renewal of HSCs. Reya et al. (2003) concluded that
the WNT signaling pathway is critical for normal HSC homeostasis in
vitro and in vivo, and provide insight into a potential molecular
hierarchy of regulation of HSC development.

Huang et al. (2009) used a chemical genetic screen to identify a small
molecule, XAV939, which selectively inhibits beta-catenin-mediated
transcription. XAV939 stimulates beta-catenin degradation by stabilizing
axin, the concentration-limiting component of the destruction complex.
Using a quantitative chemical proteomic approach, Huang et al. (2009)
found that XAV939 stabilizes axin by inhibiting the
poly-ADP-ribosylating enzymes tankyrase-1 (603303) and tankyrase-2
(607128). Both tankyrase isoforms interact with a highly conserved
domain of axin and stimulate its degradation through the
ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.

Kim et al. (2013) reported that WNT signaling is governed by
phosphorylation regulation of the axin scaffolding function.
Phosphorylation by GSK3 (see 605004) kept axin activated (open) for
beta-catenin (116806) interaction and poised for engagement of LRP6
(603507). Formation of the WNT-induced LRP6-axin signaling complex
promoted axin dephosphorylation by protein phosphatase-1 (see 176875)
and inactivated (closed) axin through an intramolecular interaction.
Inactivation of axin diminished its association with beta-catenin and
LRP6, thereby inhibiting beta-catenin phosphorylation and enabling
activated LRP6 to selectively recruit active axin for inactivation
reiteratively.

Lui et al. (2011) found that the deubiquitinating protease USP34
(615295) stabilized nuclear AXIN1 in human cell lines and promoted
expression of beta-catenin target genes. USP34 immunoprecipitated with
ubiquitinated AXIN1. Lui et al. (2011) noted that tankyrase-dependent
poly-ADP-ribosylation of AXIN1 is a prerequisite for AXIN1
ubiquitination. Knockdown of USP34 or both AXIN1 and AXIN2 together in
human cell lines reduced Wnt reporter activity, suggesting that rescue
of AXIN1 from proteasomal degradation contributes to the positive effect
of AXIN1 on Wnt signaling. Lui et al. (2011) concluded that nuclear
AXIN1 has a positive regulatory role in Wnt-beta-catenin signaling that
is controlled by USP34 opposing tankyrase-dependent ubiquitination of
AXIN1.

MAPPING

By inclusion within mapped cosmids, Zeng et al. (1997) mapped the human
AXIN1 gene to 16p13.3.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

The high rate of discordance in monozygotic twin pairs for most complex
diseases is a puzzle. The possibility has been considered that
stochastically or environmentally triggered differences in the
epigenetic status of key genes may be responsible for some MZ
discordance and, indeed, for much of the burden of complex disease. For
most complex traits, there are very few identified genes whose
methylation status can be investigated or pertinent tissue is accessible
for methylation studies on living subjects. Until such genes for common
diseases become known, therefore, it is worth investigating cases of MZ
discordance for rare diseases in which the causal gene(s) are known or
strongly suspected. Caudal duplication anomaly (607864) resembles the
spinal duplication seen in Axin(Fu) mice, which carry a mutation in the
Axin locus (Zeng et al., 1997). Highly penetrant mice displayed
bifurcating tails as a result of caudal duplication in the distal
region.

Oates et al. (2006) studied a pair of monozygotic (MZ) twins discordant
for a caudal duplication anomaly (607864), in whom Kroes et al. (2002)
had found no mutation in the AXIN1 gene. Using bisulfite sequencing,
they examined methylation at the promoter region of the AXIN1 gene in
these twins and in age-related singleton controls. Methylation of the
promoter region (608271.0002) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was
variable among individuals, including MZ pairs. In the MZ pair
discordant for the caudal duplication, this region of the affected twin
was significantly more methylated than that of the unaffected twin (P
less than 0.0001), which was significantly more methylated than those of
the controls (P = 0.02). Oates et al. (2006) confirmed that this CpG
island functions as a promoter in vitro and that its activity is
inversely proportional to the extent of methylation. This finding raised
the possibility that hypermethylation of the AXIN1 promoter is
associated with the malformation. The authors suggested that this case
may be paradigmatic for some cases of MZ discordance.

HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA, SOMATIC
AXIN1, 33-BP DEL

In a primary hepatocellular carcinoma (114550), Satoh et al. (2000)
found a 33-bp deletion in exon 3 of the AXIN1 gene, involving 2 glycogen
synthase kinase-3-beta (GSK3B; 605004) phosphorylation sites. In
addition to this deletion they found 12 missense mutations, of which 9
occurred in codons encoding serine or threonine residues. They confirmed
that all 13 mutations found in primary HCCs occurred as somatic events.

CAUDAL DUPLICATION ANOMALY
AXIN1, PROMOTER HYPERMETHYLATION

Oates et al. (2006) examined methylation at the promoter region of the
AXIN1 gene in monozygotic twins discordant for a caudal duplication
anomaly (607864). Methylation of the promoter region in the peripheral
blood mononucleated cells was variable among individuals. The promoter
region of the AXIN1 gene was significantly more methylated in the twin
with the caudal duplication than in the unaffected twin, which was
significantly more methylated than those in controls.

606944	TITLE *606944 ERBB2 INTERACTING PROTEIN; ERBB2IP
;;DENSIN-180-LIKE PROTEIN; ERBIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

In a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a mouse kidney cDNA library with the 9
C-terminal residues of Erbb2 (164870) as bait, Borg et al. (2000) cloned
Erbb2ip, which they called Erbin. They cloned human ERBB2IP by RT-PCR of
a human B-lymphocyte cell line. The deduced 1,371-amino acid protein
contains 16 canonical LRR (leucine-rich repeat) motifs at the N
terminus, followed by an LRR-like domain, proline-rich stretches that
may represent binding sites for SH3 and WW domains, and a C-terminal PDZ
domain. Northern blot analysis revealed a 7.2-kb transcript in most
human and mouse tissues. Western blot analysis indicated a 180-kD
doublet in all tissues tested.

Favre et al. (2001) cloned ERBB2IP in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a human
keratinocyte cDNA library with the N terminus of bullous pemphigoid
antigen-1 (BPAG1; 113810) as bait. They observed several splice
variants. ERBB2IP was expressed as a doublet of about 6.9 to 7.4 kb in
human keratinocytes and in a keratinocyte cell line. Semiquantitative
RT-PCR indicated numerous transcripts expressed in most tissues. Western
blot analysis showed a 200-kD in differentiated cells but not in
undifferentiated keratinocytes.

Huang et al. (2001) cloned Erbb2ip from mouse muscle, brain, and heart
cDNA libraries in a yeast 2-hybrid screen using Erbb2 as bait. Erbb2ip
was expressed as a 180-kD protein in brain, skeletal muscle, primary
muscle cultures, and muscle cell lines. Erbb2ip expression was found at
a similar level in myoblasts and myotubes, suggesting that expression is
not differentially regulated in muscle. By immunolocalization studies,
they colocalized Erbb2ip with the acetylcholine receptor at the
neuromuscular junction. Both Erbb2 and Erbb2ip were also found in
synaptosomes from adult mouse brain and copurified with postsynaptic
densities.

GENE FUNCTION

Using coimmunoprecipitation, mutation analysis, and GST pull-down
experiments, Borg et al. (2000) determined that ERBB2IP interacts with
nonactivated ERBB2 and that the interaction requires the PDZ domain of
ERBB2IP. They further showed by immunolocalization studies that the 2
proteins colocalize to the basolateral surface of polarized human colon
carcinoma cells and that mutation of the PDZ domain of ERBB2IP causes
mislocalization of ERBB2 in stably transfected canine kidney cells.

By mutation analysis and in vitro binding assays, Favre et al. (2001)
determined that ERBB2IP interacts specifically with BPAG1 and integrin
beta-4 (147557).

Huang et al. (2001) found that mouse Erbb2ip associates with Psd95
(602887). Mutation analysis indicated that the interaction is dependent
upon the PDZ domain of Psd95.

GENE STRUCTURE

Favre et al. (2001) determined that the ERBB2IP gene contains at least
26 exons. Sequence comparison of ERBB2IP variants indicated that the
variants are likely caused by alternate splicing between exons 21 and
26.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the ERBB2IP
gene to chromosome 5 (TMAP WI-31186). Favre et al. (2001) stated that
sequence analysis places the ERBB2IP gene on the long arm of chromosome
5 between D5S427 and D5S647.

611732	TITLE *611732 MEMBRANE-BOUND O-ACETYLTRANSFERASE DOMAIN-CONTAINING 1; MBOAT1
;;MEMBRANE-BOUND O-ACETYLTRANSFERASE 1;;
LYSOPHOSPHATIDYLETHANOLAMINE ACYLTRANSFERASE 1; LPEAT1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MBOAT1 shares structural similarity with a superfamily of membrane-bound
O-acetyltransferases that transfer organic compounds, usually fatty
acids (e.g., cholesterol, diacylglycerol, palmitoyl), onto hydroxyl
groups of membrane-embedded targets (Dauwerse et al., 2007).

CLONING

Using database analysis to identify genes within a t(4;6) breakpoint
found in a man with a brachydactyly-syndactyly syndrome (611733),
followed by aligning available ESTs, Dauwerse et al. (2007) obtained a
full-length MBOAT1 cDNA sequence. The deduced 495-amino acid protein
contains 9 transmembrane domains, an extracellular N terminus, and an
intracellular C terminus. MBOAT1 shares similarity with membrane-bound
O-acetyltransferases, including conservation of polar residues within
and adjacent to the membrane, and an invariant active site histidine at
position 381. Dauwerse et al. (2007) noted that the mouse homolog
contains a signal sequence of 47 amino acids that is not found in human
MBOAT1.

Hishikawa et al. (2008) cloned mouse Mboat1, which they called Lpeat1.
The deduced 492-amino acid protein contains 9 putative transmembrane
domains and a C-terminal endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention motif
(KKxx). RT-PCR detected high Lpeat1 expression in stomach, epididymis,
and colon. Lpeat1 colocalized with an ER marker protein in transfected
Chinese hamster ovary cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Hishikawa et al. (2008) found that mouse Lpeat1 converted
lysophosphatidylethanolamine and lysophosphatidylserine to
phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine, respectively, and
preferred oleoyl-CoA as the acyl donor.

GENE STRUCTURE

Dauwerse et al. (2007) determined that the MBOAT1 gene contains 13 exons
and spans about 112 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Dauwerse et al. (2007) mapped the MBOAT1
gene to chromosome 6p23.

CYTOGENETICS

In a man with short stature, mild facial dysmorphism, cutaneous
syndactyly, and extreme brachydactyly (611733) who was found to have a
de novo translocation t(4;6)(q12;p23), Dauwerse et al. (2007) showed
that the MBOAT1 gene was disrupted by the breakpoint. No genes were
found to be disrupted on chromosome 4.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Dauwerse et al. (2007) analyzed the MBOAT1 gene by SCCP in 150 patients

610413	TITLE *610413 INSULIN-LIKE GROWTH FACTOR BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE 1; IGFBPL1
;;IGFBP-RELATED PROTEIN 4; IGFBPRP4
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Cai et al. (2005) cloned IGFBPL1 cDNA from human testes. The deduced
278-amino acid protein contains a signal peptide and conserved motifs
typical of the IGFBP family (see 146733). It shares 52% sequence
identity with IGFBP7 (602867). Expression of the cDNA in COS-7 cells
yielded a product of 38 kD. Semiquantitative real-time PCR revealed
highest levels of expression in brain and testis, and lower levels in
prostate, bladder, and lung. Expression was downregulated in all 5 colon
tumor samples and 4 of 6 lung tumor samples tested.

GENE FUNCTION

Using transient transfection experiments, Cai et al. (2005) demonstrated
that IGFBPL1 significantly inhibited the growth of HeLa cells. They
suggested that an apoptotic mechanism was responsible for the growth
inhibition.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the IGFBPL1
gene to chromosome 9 (TMAP WI-11112).

607845	TITLE *607845 EXPORTIN 5; XPO5
;;KIAA1291
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Exportin-5 belongs to a large family of karyopherins (see 602738) that
mediate the transport of proteins and other cargo between the nuclear
and cytoplasmic compartments.

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1999) cloned an XPO5 cDNA, which they designated
KIAA1291. RT-PCR ELISA detected low to moderate expression in all
tissues and specific brain regions examined.

Brownawell and Macara (2002) determined that KIAA1291 shares significant
homology with the general nucleoporin export receptor, CRM1 (XPO1;
602559). They obtained a full-length XPO5 cDNA by 5-prime RACE of a
brain cDNA library. The deduced 1,205-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of about 136 kD. XPO5 and XPO1 share 25% amino
acid identity. Northern blot analysis detected transcripts of about 3.6
and 5.0 kb in all tissues examined.

GENE FUNCTION

Using various criteria, Brownawell and Macara (2002) determined that
XPO5 shares several characteristics with other karyopherins. XPO5 bound
RAN (601179) in the GTP-bound conformation, and binding required the
N-terminal domain of XPO5. XPO5 bound the nucleoporins NUP214 (114350)
and NUP153 (603948) in a RAN-GTP-independent manner and bound a cargo
protein, ILF3 (603182), in a RAN-GTP-dependent manner. XPO5 bound ILF3
at its double-stranded RNA-binding domain (dsRBD) and also bound the
dsRBDs of other proteins. Using a heterokaryon fusion assay, Brownawell
and Macara (2002) demonstrated that XPO5 shuttles between the nuclear
and cytoplasmic compartments. They concluded that XPO5 regulates the
translocation of dsRBD proteins to the cytoplasm, where they interact
with target mRNAs.

By microinjection in Xenopus oocytes, Gwizdek et al. (2003) found that
XPO5 mediated the nuclear export of adenovirus VA1 RNA. XPO5 directly
interacted with VA1 RNA in a RAN-GTP-dependent manner. In vivo and in
vitro competition experiments with various VA1, artificial, and cellular
RNAs led the authors to conclude that XPO5 preferentially recognizes and
transports RNAs containing a minihelix motif, which is a double-stranded
stem structure.

Lund et al. (2004) demonstrated that exportin-5 mediates efficient
nuclear export of short microRNA (miRNA) precursors (pre-miRNAs) and
that its depletion by RNA interference results in reduced miRNA levels.
XPO5 binds correctly processed pre-miRNAs directly and specifically, in
a RAN-GTP-dependent manner, but interacts only weakly with extended
pre-miRNAs that yield incorrect miRNAs when processed by Dicer (606241)
in vitro. Thus, Lund et al. (2004) concluded that XPO5 is key to miRNA
biogenesis and may help coordinate nuclear and cytoplasmic processing
steps.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Okada et al. (2009) presented the 2.9-angstrom structure of the
pre-miRNA nuclear export machinery formed by pre-miRNA complexed with
Exp5 and a GTP-bound form of the small nuclear GTPase Ran (RANGAP1;
602362). The x-ray structure showed that Exp5:RanGTP recognizes the
2-nucleotide 3-prime overhang structure and the double-stranded stem of
the pre-miRNA. Exp5:RanGTP shields the pre-miRNA stem from degradation
in a baseball mitt-like structure where it is held by broadly
distributed weak interactions, whereas a tunnel-like structure of Exp5
interacts strongly with the 2-nucleotide 3-prime overhang through
hydrogen bonds and ionic interactions. RNA recognition by Exp5:RanGTP
does not depend on RNA sequence, implying that Exp5:RanGTP can recognize
a variety of pre-miRNAs.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the XPO5
gene to chromosome 6 (TMAP stSG6379).
