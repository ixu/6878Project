182465	TITLE *182465 SON DNA-BINDING PROTEIN; SON
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SON is a nuclear speckle-localized protein that shares homology with
pre-mRNA splicing accessory factors (Wynn et al., 2000).

CLONING

Berdichevskii et al. (1988) cloned a fragment designated Son3 from a
human embryonic cDNA bank. The nucleotide sequence was found to be 1,454
bp long with 6 possible open reading frames, only 1 of which did not
contain terminating codons. Translation of that open reading frame into
an amino acid sequence and database analysis showed that the Son3 region
codes for a protein with the following distinctive features: (1) the
presence of a cluster of short tandem repeats from 7 to 19 amino acids
long, located in the central part of the sequence; (2) the presence of
lengthy regions of homology with certain DNA-binding structural
proteins, such as gallin (55%), and also with oncoproteins encoded by
protooncogenes of the MYC family; and (3) the presence of a region of
homology with an oncoprotein encoded by the MOS protooncogene (190060).

Wynn et al. (2000) independently identified human SON, which shares
84.2% amino acid identity with its mouse homolog. SON has a basic
serine/arginine-rich C-terminal domain that shares homology with
proteins involved in mRNA processing. Immunofluorescence studies
localized endogenous SON to interchromatin granules of the interphase
nucleus in human epithelial cells. The nuclear speckled staining pattern
was similar to that observed with mRNA splicing factors, suggesting that
SON may play a role in mRNA processing.

GENE FUNCTION

From a human keratinocyte cDNA library, Khan et al. (1994) isolated a
clone for the DNA-binding protein SON. Using this clone, they found that
the SON gene is expressed in various cell types and that homologous
sequences can be detected in vertebrate and insect genomic DNA.

Using a combination of proteomics, cytology, and functional analysis in
C. elegans, Chu et al. (2006) reduced 1,099 proteins copurified with
spermatogenic chromatin to 132 proteins for functional analysis. This
strategy to find fertility factors conserved from C. elegans to mammals
achieved its goal: of mouse gene knockouts corresponding to nematode
proteins, 37% (7 of 19) cause male sterility. This list includes PPP1CC
(176914), H2AX (601772), SON, TOP1 (126420), DDX4 (605281), DBY
(400010), and CENPC (117141).

Karlas et al. (2010) reported the discovery of 287 human host cell genes
influencing influenza A virus replication, including SON, in a
genomewide RNA interference screen. Using an independent assay, Karlas
et al. (2010) confirmed 168 hits (59%) inhibiting either the endemic
HIN1 (119 hits) or the pandemic swine-origin (121 hits) influenza A
virus strains, with an overlap of 60%. SON was found to be important for
normal trafficking of influenza virions to late endosomes early in
infection.

GENE STRUCTURE

Slavov et al. (2000) predicted that the SON gene contains 10 exons
spanning 25 kb. Wynn et al. (2000) determined that the SON gene contains
12 exons.

MAPPING

Using PCR to amplify SON sequences from a panel of somatic cell hybrids,
Khan et al. (1994) assigned the human SON gene to chromosome 21. By use
of hybrids containing regions of chromosome 21, the localization was
refined to 21q22.1-q22.2.

Wynn et al. (2000) determined that both human and mouse SON and DONSON
(611428) are in tail-to-tail orientation and in the following order:
GART (138440)-SON-DONSON.

RHOMBOID-RELATED PROTEIN; RRP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The Drosophila Rhomboid protein has been implicated in the modulation of
epidermal growth factor receptor (see 131550) signaling. By searching
sequence databases for Rhomboid homologs, Pascall and Brown (1998)
identified a human genomic clone containing the RRP (Rhomboid-related
protein) gene. Using a PCR strategy with cDNA derived from a human
leukemic cell line, the authors cloned cDNAs corresponding to the entire
RRP coding region. Sequence analysis indicated that the predicted
438-amino acid protein has 7 transmembrane domains and an intracellular
N terminus. RRP and Rhomboid share 30% amino acid sequence identity. By
Northern blot analysis, Pascall and Brown (1998) determined that RRP is
expressed as a 1.7-kb mRNA in brain and kidney; larger transcripts were
detected in heart, skeletal muscle, and brain.

GENE STRUCTURE

Pascall and Brown (1998) determined that the RRP gene contains 7 exons
that span approximately 2.2 kb.

MAPPING

Pascall and Brown (1998) stated that the genomic clone containing the
RRP gene was derived from human chromosome 16.

604881	TITLE *604881 RABPHILIN 3A-LIKE; RPH3AL
;;NOC2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a DNA fragment encoding the Rab3A (179490)-binding domain of a
mouse rabphilin-3A (RPH3A; 612159) cDNA, Kotake et al. (1997) probed a
rat islet cDNA library under low stringency and identified rat Rph3al,
which they designated Noc2. A full-length Noc2 clone was isolated from a
rat insulin-secreting cell line cDNA library. The Noc2 cDNA encodes a
302-amino acid protein that shows 40.7% amino acid identity and 77.9%
similarity to the N-terminal region of rat rabphilin-3A. However, it
lacks the C2 domains, and hence the Noc2 (no C2 domain) designation.
Noc2 contains 1 potential protein kinase A and 3 potential protein
kinase C phosphorylation sites. RNA blot analysis revealed that a single
2.2- or 2.6-kb transcript of Noc2 is expressed at very high levels in
pancreatic islets, and at low to moderate or high levels in other
endocrine tissues and hormone-secreting cell lines, but at very low
levels in brain. Screening a mouse embryonic cDNA library with the yeast
2-hybrid system, Kotake et al. (1997) showed that Noc2 interacts with
the LIM domain-containing protein zyxin (602002), a component of the
cytoskeleton. The authors suggested that Noc2 is probably involved in
regulated exocytosis in endocrine cells by interacting with the
cytoskeleton.

Using cDNA selection, Smith et al. (1999) identified a human transcript
spanning a common deletion on 17p13.3 found in approximately 40% of
medulloblastomas. The full-length coding sequence predicted a 315-amino
acid protein displaying 77% amino acid identity with the rat Noc2
(Rph3al) protein. Northern blot analysis detected moderate to high
expression of a 2.6-kb RPH3AL transcript in thyroid, ovary, stomach,
heart, pancreas, skeletal muscle, kidney, and liver.

GENE STRUCTURE

Smith et al. (1999) determined that the RPH3AL gene contains 9 exons.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Smith et al. (1999) determined that at least 1 exon of the RPH3AL gene
maps within the common 9-kb deletion on chromosome 17p13.3 found in
medulloblastomas. However, they found no mutations in this gene in 33
tumor samples with allelic loss of 17p13, including 10 medulloblastomas,
14 follicular thyroid cancers, and 9 ovarian cancers.

610365	TITLE *610365 C1q- AND TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR-RELATED PROTEIN 1; C1QTNF1
;;G PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTOR-INTERACTING PROTEIN; GIP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using the second intracellular loop of V2R (AVPR2; 300538) as bait in a
yeast 2-hybrid screen of a human kidney cDNA library, followed by RACE
of heart and HEK293 mRNA, Innamorati et al. (2002) cloned C1QTNF1, which
they called GIP. The deduced protein contains 379 amino acids. The
extracellular N terminus contains a TNF (see 191160) family
cysteine-rich region, followed by a transmembrane domain, a C-terminal
collagen-like sequence of 14 Gly-X-Y repeats, and a globular domain.
Northern blot analysis detected prominent expression in heart and lower
expression in placenta, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, prostate and
ovary. Little to no expression was detected in other tissues examined.
In transfected HEK293 and COS cells, epitope-tagged GIP was expressed in
vesicular structures surrounding the nucleus and near the cell surface.
Western blot analysis detected epitope-tagged GIP at about 40 kD and 130
kD, suggesting GIP can form trimers.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a yeast 2-hybrid assay and pull-down experiments, Innamorati et
al. (2002) confirmed the interaction between the second intracellular
loop of V2R and the C-terminal portion of GIP.

GENE STRUCTURE

Innamorati et al. (2002) determined that the C1QTNF1 gene contains 3
coding exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Innamorati et al. (2002) mapped the
C1QTNF1 gene to chromosome 17q25.

601337	TITLE *601337 REGULATORY FACTOR X, 3; RFX3
DESCRIPTION The RFX1 gene product (600006) is a transactivator of the human
hepatitis B viral enhancer I. Reith et al. (1994) commented that the RFX
family members (in particular RFX1 and RFX3) constitute the nuclear
complexes referred to previously as enhancer factor C (EF-C), EP, and
methylation-dependent DNA-binding protein (MDBP), or rpL30-alpha. They
identified and cloned 3 members of this gene family from both human and
mouse using lambda gt11 cDNA libraries. Reith et al. (1994) found that
the gene for RFX3 encodes a 707-amino acid polypeptide. Homology between
the 3 RFX proteins is restricted largely to 5 conserved regions,
including the 2 domains required for DNA binding and dimerization. RFX1,
RFX2 (142765), and RFX3 all have similar DNA-binding specificities. The
RFX monomers can heterodimerize both in vivo and in vitro but all 3 are
capable of binding DNA as monomers. They showed that the RFX3 transcript
is expressed in many mouse tissues, with highest expression in the
brain, intestine, and testis but low expression in the seminal vesicle.

;;RIBOSOMAL RNA-PROCESSING PROTEIN 42, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; RRP42;;
KIAA0116
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing cDNAs randomly selected from a cDNA library derived from
the human immature myeloid cell line KG-1, Nagase et al. (1995) isolated
a cDNA encoding RRP42, which they designated KIAA0116. The predicted
290-amino acid KIAA0116 protein is 26.7% identical to the 75-kD
autoantigen (PMSCL1; 606180) over a 225-amino acid region. Northern blot
analysis detected expression of KIAA0116 in all tissues tested.

Inherently unstable mammalian mRNAs contain AU-rich elements (AREs)
within their 3-prime untranslated regions. In yeast, 3-prime-to-5-prime
mRNA degradation is mediated by the exosome, a multisubunit particle.
Chen et al. (2001) purified and characterized the human exosome by mass
spectrometry and found its composition to be similar to its yeast
counterpart. They identified the following protein subunits within the
human exosome: p7, which is homologous to the yeast Rrp4 protein
(602238); p8, which is homologous to the yeast Rrp42 protein; p9, which
is homologous to the yeast Rrp43 protein (OIP2; 606019); p10, which is
homologous to the yeast Rrp40 protein (606489); p11, which is homologous
to the yeast Mtr3 protein (606490); p12A, which is homologous to the
yeast Rrp41 protein (606491); p12B, which is homologous to the yeast
Rrp46 protein (606492); and p13, which is homologous to the yeast Csl4
protein (606493). They also identified 2 exosome-associated factors, p1
(600478) and p14 (MPP6; 605500), that were not homologous to any yeast
exosome components.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a cell-free RNA decay system, Chen et al. (2001) demonstrated that
the mammalian exosome is required for rapid degradation of
ARE-containing RNAs but not for poly(A) shortening. They found that the
mammalian exosome does not recognize ARE-containing RNAs on its own. ARE
recognition required certain ARE-binding proteins that could interact
with the exosome and recruit it to unstable RNAs, thereby promoting
their rapid degradation.

Using mammalian 2-hybrid and GST pull-down analyses, Raijmakers et al.
(2002) found that the CSL4 protein, but not mutant forms lacking N- or
C-terminal residues, interacted directly with RRP42 and RRP46. The
deletion mutants were also unable to interact with the exosome. RRP42
and RRP46 did not interact with each other.

MAPPING

By analysis of a panel of human/rodent hybrid cell lines, Nagase et al.
(1995) mapped the KIAA0116 gene to chromosome 3.

603871	TITLE *603871 BY THE RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN S6 GENE, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG-LIKE; BYSL
;;BYSTIN
DESCRIPTION Trophinin (300132) and tastin (603872) form a cell adhesion molecule
complex that may be involved in mediating the initial attachment of the
blastocyst to uterine epithelial cells at the time of implantation.
However, Suzuki et al. (1998) found that trophinin and tastin do not
bind to each other directly in vitro or in yeast 2-hybrid assays. By
using an expression assay, these authors isolated a cDNA that allowed
COS-1 cells expressing trophinin to adhere to the upper surfaces of
SNG-M endometrial adenocarcinoma cells. The cDNA encoded a predicted
306-amino acid protein that they named 'bystin' because it is 53%
identical to Drosophila bys (symbolizing 'by the ribosomal protein S6
gene'), or mrr (myosin rod-related), protein. Bystin has an apparent
molecular weight of 35 kD. Northern blot analysis revealed that bystin
is expressed as a 2-kb major transcript and a 3.6-kb minor transcript in
SNG-M cells and in human trophoblastic teratocarcinoma HT-H cells. Using
yeast 2- and 3-hybrid assays and in vitro protein binding assays, Suzuki
et al. (1998) determined that bystin binds directly to trophinin and
tastin, and that this binding is enhanced when cytokeratins 8 (148060)
and 18 (148070) are present. Immunocytochemistry of HT-H cells showed
that bystin colocalizes with trophinin, tastin, and the cytokeratins.
The authors suggested that these molecules form a complex in
trophectoderm cells at the time of implantation. Using
immunohistochemistry, Suzuki et al. (1999) determined that trophinin and
bystin are found in the placenta from the sixth week of pregnancy. Both
proteins were localized in the cytoplasm of the syncytiotrophoblast in
the chorionic villi and in endometrial decidual cells at the
uteroplacental interface. After week 10, the levels of trophinin,
tastin, and bystin decreased and then disappeared from placental villi.

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Pack et al. (1998) mapped the
bystin gene to 6p21.1.

604470	TITLE *604470 CD2 ANTIGEN-BINDING PROTEIN 2; CD2BP2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Human CD2 (186990) facilitates both adhesion and activation of T
lymphocytes on binding to its ligand CD58 (LFA3; 153420). This binding
augments interleukin-12 (IL12; see 161560)-driven T-cell responsiveness.
By use of interaction trap cloning with the yeast 2-hybrid system and
5-prime RACE PCR, Nishizawa et al. (1998) identified a T-cell line cDNA
encoding a 341-amino acid protein, termed CD2BP2, that interacts with
the cytoplasmic tail of CD2. The authors noted that a segment near the C
terminus contains a consensus site for tyrosine phosphorylation. RNA
blot analysis indicated that CD2BP2 is expressed in a wide variety of
organs as approximately 1.35- and 4-kb transcripts. Immunoprecipitation
experiments showed that CD2BP2 expressed in J77 Jurkat and COS-7 cells
associates specifically with CD2. Mutation analysis suggested that a
21-amino acid motif is critical for CD2 binding and that 2 PPPGHR
sequences within the CD2 cytoplasmic tail mediate the binding to CD2BP2.
Additional transfection studies showed that CD2BP2 expression
selectively enhances IL2 (147680) production on crosslinking of CD2.

;;ML4 GENE;;
MUCOLIPIDIN;;
TRANSIENT RECEPTOR POTENTIAL CATION CHANNEL, MUCOLIPIN SUBFAMILY,
MEMBER 1; TRPML1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By positional cloning of the mucolipidosis IV (252650) locus on
chromosome 19p, Bargal et al. (2000) identified a gene, designated
MCOLN1, encoding a 580-amino acid protein termed mucolipin-1. The
mucolipin-1 protein contains 1 transmembrane helix in the N-terminal
region and at least 5 transmembrane domains in the C-terminal region.

Bassi et al. (2000) also identified the MCOLN1 gene, which they termed
'ML4.' The corresponding protein, which the authors named 'mucolipidin,'
localizes on the plasma membrane and, in the carboxy-terminal region,
shows homology to polycystin-2, the product of the polycystic kidney
disease gene (PKD2; 173910), and to the family of transient receptor
potential Ca(2+) channels (see 602343). They suggested that mucolipidin
plays an important role in endocytosis.

Sun et al. (2000) independently cloned the MCOLN1 gene. The 65-kD
protein contains a transient receptor potential (TRP) cation channel
domain (amino acids 331-521) and an internal calcium and sodium channel
pore region (amino acids 496-521). The TRP domain spans transmembrane
segments 3-6, with the putative pore-forming loop between the fifth and
sixth segments. There is also a dileucine motif at the C terminus which
may serve as a late endosomal/lysosomal targeting motif. The protein is
predicted to have both the N- and C-termini within the cytoplasm. Sun et
al. (2000) suggested that mucolipin-1 may play a role in calcium ion
transport.

GENE STRUCTURE

Bargal et al. (2000) determined that the MCOLN1 gene contains 14 exons
spanning approximately 14 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Bargal et al. (2000) mapped the MCOLN1
gene to chromosome 19p13.3-p13.2.

GENE FUNCTION

Lysosomal exocytosis is a calcium-dependent process in which late
endosomes fuse with lysosomes, which then fuse to the plasma membrane.
The local calcium source is the luminal compartment of the late endosome
or lysosome itself. By in vitro electrophysiologic studies, LaPlante et
al. (2002, 2004) identified mucolipin-1 as a calcium channel that could
be transiently modulated by changes in calcium concentration. The
channel was also permeable to sodium and potassium, and was detected
both on intracellular vesicular membranes, including lysosomes, and on
the plasma membrane. Fibroblasts derived from ML IV patients with
mutations in the MCOLN1 gene showed disturbed calcium signaling, large
acidic organelles, and decreased fusion between endosomes and lysosomes
compared to wildtype cells. LaPlante et al. (2004) concluded that the
MCOLN1 channel contributes to the increase in local concentrations of
calcium during the transition between different stages in membrane
trafficking. Cells with defects in the MCOLN1 channel cannot release
enough calcium, resulting in slow and inefficient endosomal and
lysosomal fusion and an abnormal accumulation of lipid and other
materials as seen in ML IV.

Raychowdhury et al. (2004) assessed mucolipin-1 channel function from
endosomal vesicles of null (MCOLN1 -/-) and mucolipin-1 over-expressing
cells, and liposomes containing the in vitro translated protein.
Evidence from both preparations indicated that the wildtype protein is a
multiple subconductance nonselective cation channel whose function is
inhibited by a reduction of pH. The V446L and F408del ML IV-causing
mutations retained channel function but not the sharp inhibition by
lowering pH. Atomic force imaging of mucolipin-1 channels indicated that
changes in pH modified the aggregation of unitary channels. The mutant
protein did not change in size on reduction of pH. Raychowdhury et al.
(2004) concluded that mucolipin-1 channel activity is regulated by a
pH-dependent mechanism that is deficient in some ML IV-causing mutations
of the gene. They also suggested a role for cation channels in the
acidification and normal endosomal function.

By transfecting human embryonic kidney cells with various combinations
of mouse Trpml3 (MCOLN3; 607400), chicken Trpml2 (MCOLN2; 607399), and
human TRPML1, Venkatachalam et al. (2006) showed that each TRPML could
form homomultimers and heteromultimers with other TRPML proteins. When
expressed individually, TRPML1 and Trpml2 were lysosomal membrane
proteins, whereas Trpml3 was retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. In
contrast, when Trpml3 was coexpressed with either TRPML1 or Trpml2, it
relocalized to lysosomes. Mutation of the lysosomal targeting sequence
of TRPML1 or Trpml2 or disruption of clathrin-mediated endocytosis
caused mislocalization of TRPML1 and Trpml2 to the plasma membrane and
also resulted in plasma membrane distribution of Trpml3. Trpml3 did not
influence the intracellular localization of TRPML1 or Trpml2.

By measuring radiolabeled iron uptake, monitoring the levels of
cytosolic and intralysosomal iron, and by directly patch-clamping the
late endosomal and lysosomal membrane, Dong et al. (2008) showed that
TRPML1 functions as a Fe(2+)-permeable channel in late endosomes and
lysosomes. TRPML1 mutations resulting in ML IV (252650) impair the
permeability of TRPML1 to Fe(2+) to varying degrees, which correlate
well with disease severity. A comparison of TRPML1-null ML IV and
control human skin fibroblasts showed a reduction in cytosolic Fe(2+)
levels, an increase in intralysosomal Fe(2+) levels, and an accumulation
of lipofuscin-like molecules in TRPML1-null cells. Dong et al. (2008)
proposed that TRPML1 mediates a mechanism by which Fe(2+) is released
from late endosomes and lysosomes. Dong et al. (2008) concluded that
impaired iron transport may contribute to both hematologic and
degenerative symptoms of ML IV patients.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 21 Ashkenazi Jewish ML IV patients, Bargal et al. (2000) identified 2
mutations in the MCOLN1 gene (605248.0001; 605248.0002) that correlated
with the major and minor haplotypes identified by Slaugenhaupt et al.
(1999). Six patients were compound heterozygous for both mutations and 2
patients were compound heterozygous for 1 of the founder mutations and a
second unidentified mutation. The clinical manifestations of all
patients showed similar severity.

Bargal et al. (2001) identified 4 mutations in the MCOLN1 gene in
severely affected patients with ML IV. An in-frame deletion (F408del)
was identified in a patient with unusually mild psychomotor retardation.
The frequency of ML IV in the general Jewish Ashkenazi population was
estimated in a sample of 2,000 anonymous, unrelated individuals assayed
for the 2 founder mutations. This analysis indicated a heterozygote
frequency of about 1 in 100.

Edelmann et al. (2002) stated that the 2 common MCOLN1 mutations
(IVS3-2A-G, 605248.0001; del Ex1-Ex7, 605248.0002) accounted for more
than 95% of the mutant alleles in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. In
the greater New York metropolitan area, the frequency of the splice site
mutation was 0.54% and of the deletion mutation 0.25%, for a combined
carrier frequency of 0.79%, or 1 in 127 individuals. They suggested that
the addition of both mutations be considered for prenatal carrier
screening in this population.

Bach et al. (2005) found a carrier frequency of 0.0104 for ML IV in a
population of 66,749 Ashkenazi Jewish subjects of the Dor Yeshorim
program, a unique premarital population-screening program designed for
the Orthodox Jewish community. The distribution of the 2 Ashkenazi
Jewish founder mutations, IVS3-2A-G and del Ex1-Ex7, was determined to
be 78.15% and 21.85%, respectively.

ANIMAL MODEL

Unlike other lysosomal storage diseases, ML IV is not associated with a
lack of lysosomal hydrolases; instead, ML IV cells display abnormal
endocytosis of lipids and accumulate large vesicles, indicating that a
defect in endocytosis may underlie the disease. Fares and Greenwald
(2001) reported the identification of a loss-of-function mutation in the
Caenorhabditis elegans mucolipin-1 homolog, cup-5, and showed that this
mutation resulted in an enhanced rate of uptake of fluid-phase markers,
decreased degradation of endocytosed protein, and accumulation of large
vacuoles. Overexpression of cup-5(+) caused the opposite phenotype,
indicating that cup-5 activity controls aspects of endocytosis.

Venugopal et al. (2007) described a murine model for mucolipidosis type
IV that accurately replicated the phenotypes of patients with the
disorder. The Mcoln1 -/- knockout mice presented with numerous dense
inclusion bodies in all cell types in brain and particularly in neurons,
elevated plasma gastrin, vacuolization in gastric parietal cells, and
retinal degeneration. Neurobehavioral assessments, including analysis of
gait and clasping, confirmed the presence of a neurologic defect. Gait
deficits progressed to complete hind-limb paralysis and death at
approximately 8 months of age. The Mcoln1 -/- mice were born in
mendelian ratios, and both male and female Mcoln1 -/- mice were fertile.
A hallmark of human mucolipidosis IV is elevated plasma gastrin
(Schiffmann et al., 1998), which can be increased up to 13 times that of
normal. Serum gastrin in the knockout mice was significantly elevated
compared with that in wildtype mice.

Using a Drosophila model of ML IV, Venkatachalam et al. (2008) found
that vesicular accumulation of macromolecules was due to defective
autophagy, which resulted in oxidative stress and impaired synaptic
transmission. Late apoptotic cells accumulated in Trpml-mutant brains,
and accumulation of apoptotic cells and motor deficits were suppressed
by expression of wildtype Trpml in neurons, glia, or hematopoietic
cells. Venkatachalam et al. (2008) concluded that the neurodegeneration
and motor defects in this model of ML IV resulted primarily from
decreased clearance of apoptotic cells.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MUCOLIPIDOSIS IV
MCOLN1, IVS3AS, A-G, -2

In 12 of 21 Ashkenazi Jewish patients with mucolipidosis IV (252650)
associated with the major Ashkenazi founder haplotype defined by
Slaugenhaupt et al. (1999), Bargal et al. (2000) identified a homozygous
A-to-G transition in the acceptor splice site of the third intron of the
MCOLN1 gene. One heterozygote was found among 60 Ashkenazi normal
controls; this was consistent with the estimated frequency of
heterozygotes (1/50) in this population.

Bassi et al. (2000) identified this acceptor splice site mutation, which
they designated 486-2A-G, as the major founder mutation in Ashkenazi
Jewish patients. The mutation disrupted the GT-AG rule of splicing and
resulted in a transcript lacking 165 bp, because of the skipping of exon
4. This caused a frameshift leading to a premature translation
termination 374 bp downstream. The predicted truncated protein retained
only the first 21 amino acids of the wildtype protein.

.0002
MUCOLIPIDOSIS IV
MCOLN1, 6,450-BP DEL

In 1 of 21 Ashkenazi Jewish patients with mucolipidosis IV (252650)
associated with the minor founder haplotype defined by Slaugenhaupt et
al. (1999), Bargal et al. (2000) identified a homozygous 6,450-bp
deletion in the MCOLN1 gene. The deletion spanned a region from 928 bp
upstream from the first exon of MCOLN1 to bp 31 of exon 7 (del EX1-EX7).
The clinical manifestations for homozygotes for either this mutation or
IVS3-2A-G (605248.0001), or compound heterozygotes, showed similar
severity. Among 21 Ashkenazi ML IV patients, 12 were homozygous for the
splice mutation, 1 was homozygous for the del EX1-EX7 mutation, and 6
were compound heterozygotes. Two patients were compound heterozygotes
for one of these mutations and an unidentified second allele.

Bassi et al. (2000) demonstrated this deletion, which they measured to
be 6,432 bp, spanning a region from the 5-prime end of the gene to exon
6, as the minor founder mutation in Ashkenazi Jewish patients.

.0003
MUCOLIPIDOSIS IV
MCOLN1, ARG321TER

In an Arab-Druze mucolipidosis IV (252650) patient, Bargal et al. (2000)
identified a homozygous 1048C-T transition in exon 8 of the MCOLN1 gene,
resulting in an arg321-to-ter (R321X) mutation. The parents were first
cousins and carried the same unique haplotype.

.0004
MUCOLIPIDOSIS IV
MCOLN1, 3-BP DEL, 1346CTT

In an Ashkenazi Jewish ML IV (252650) patient, Sun et al. (2000)
identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the MCOLN1 gene: a
3-bp deletion eliminating codon 408 in the TRP cation channel domain,
and the common splice mutation (605248.0001).

.0005
MUCOLIPIDOSIS IV
MCOLN1, ASP362TYR

In a non-Ashkenazi Jewish ML IV patient (252650), Sun et al. (2000)
identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the MCOLN1 gene: a
1209G-T transversion resulting in an asp362-to-tyr (D362Y) substitution
in the TRP cation channel domain, and a 429C-T transition resulting in
an arg102-to-ter (R102X; 605248.0006) termination codon. Dobrovolny et
al. (2007) stated that the D362Y substitution occurs in the third
transmembrane region of the protein and leads to retention of the
protein in the endoplasmic reticulum. They also used nucleotide
designation 1084G-T.

In a non-Ashkenazi Jewish girl with ML IV, Dobrovolny et al. (2007)
identified compound heterozygosity for the D362Y substitution and a
splice site mutation (605248.0009) in the MCLON1 gene. The phenotype was
unusual in that the symptoms were restricted to the eyes, including
corneal clouding and decreased visual acuity. She had no neurologic
abnormalities.

MUCOLIPIDOSIS IV
MCOLN1, ARG403CYS

Goldin et al. (2004) described a 4-year-old girl with mucolipidosis IV
(252650) who was a compound heterozygote for 2 mutations in the MCOLN1
gene, only 1 of which, inherited from the father, was expressed. They
found in her mucolipin-1 cDNA a 1207C-T transition predicting an
arg403-to-cys change (R403C), which changes a basic amino acid to a
neutral one in the 4th transmembrane domain of mucolipin-1. From the
mother the patient had inherited a 93-bp segment from the mitochondrial
NADH dehydrogenase-5 gene (MTND5; 516005) that was inserted in-frame
prior to the last nucleotide of exon 2 of the MCOLN1 gene
(236-237ins93). This alteration abolished proper splicing of MCOLN1. The
splice site at the end of the exon was not used due to an inhibitory
effect of the inserted segment, resulting in 2 aberrant splice products
containing stop codons in the downstream intron. These products were
eliminated via nonsense-mediated decay. The authors stated that this was
the first report of an inherited transfer of mitochondrial DNA causing a
genetic disease. The elimination of a splice site by the mitochondrial
DNA required a change in splicing prediction models.

MUCOLIPIDOSIS IV
MCOLN1, 1704A-T

In a non-Ashkenazi Jewish girl with ML IV (252650), Dobrovolny et al.
(2007) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the MCOLN1
gene. One allele carried a 1704A-T transversion near the 3-prime end of
exon 13, resulting in erroneous splicing, a 4-bp deletion, and a
predicted protein product with the last 12 amino acids exchanged for 9
different ones. Both normal and pathologic splice forms were detected in
skin fibroblasts and leukocytes, with the normal form estimated at 40%,
presumably enough to prevent psychomotor retardation. The other allele
carried D362Y (605248.0005). The phenotype was unusual in that the
symptoms were restricted to the eyes, including corneal clouding and
decreased visual acuity. She had no neurologic abnormalities.

162096	TITLE *162096 MIDKINE; MDK
;;MIDGESTATION AND KIDNEY; MK;;
NEURITE GROWTH-PROMOTING FACTOR 2, FORMERLY; NEGF2, FORMERLY
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Midkine is a retinoic acid-responsive, heparin-binding growth factor
expressed in various cell types during embryogenesis. It promotes
angiogenesis, cell growth, and cell migration. Midkine is also expressed
in several carcinomas, suggesting that it may play a role in
tumorigenesis, perhaps through its effects on angiogenesis (summary by
Reynolds et al., 2004).

CLONING

Using mouse Mk to screen a midgestation human embryonic kidney cDNA
library, followed by screening a placenta genomic library, Tsutsui et
al. (1991) cloned human MDK, which they called MK. The deduced 121-amino
acid protein has a signal sequence and shares 87% identity with mouse
Mk. Orthologs of MK were detected in rat, cow, and chicken. The chicken
ortholog, Rihb, is a retinoic acid-induced heparin-binding protein. MK
shares about 50% amino acid homology with the human heparin-binding
protein pleiotrophin (PTN; 162095), with highest conservation in the
central part of the molecule and complete conservation of cysteine
residues. Northern blot analysis detected a transcript of about 1 kb in
adult human kidney and PA1 human teratocarcinoma cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Reynolds et al. (2004) found that hypoxia induced midkine expression in
alveolar epithelial cells and pulmonary vasculature in a strain of mice
sensitive to hypoxia. Hypoxia induced expression of both HIF1-alpha
(603348) and midkine in human placental adenocarcinoma, mouse fetal lung
mesenchyme, and human pulmonary adenocarcinoma cell lines. HIF1-alpha
induced midkine expression via regulatory elements in the mouse midkine
promoter. Chronic expression of midkine during embryonic development in
transgenic mice resulted in pulmonary arterial remodeling and
muscularization, but only during the postnatal phase of lung
development. In fetal mouse lung mesenchymal cells and transgenic mice,
midkine upregulated expression of myocardin (MYOCD; 606127), a regulator
of smooth muscle cell differentiation.

Intraperitoneal adhesions between organs or between organs and
peritoneal walls occur in more than 90% of cases involving major
abdominal operations. Using a model of postoperative adhesions and
Mk-null mice, Inoh et al. (2004) showed that midkine was fundamentally
involved in the formation of intraperitoneal adhesions, at least partly
by promoting migration of macrophages and neutrophils to the omentum.

Hobo et al. (2009) found that 5/6 nephrectomy in mice, a model of
chronic kidney disease, induced expression of midkine in lung, leading
to elevated angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE; 106180) activity and
plasma angiotensin II (106150) levels and subsequent hypertension.
Exposure to midkine enhanced ACE expression in primary cultured human
lung microvascular endothelial cells. Oxidative stress may have
contributed to midkine expression, since 5/6 nephrectomy induced
expression of NADH/NADPH oxidase-1 (NOX1; 300225), Nox2 (CYBB; 300481),
and Nox4 (605261). Furthermore, an antioxidant reduced midkine
expression and plasma angiotensin II levels and ameliorated hypertension
in 5/6 nephrectomized mice.

GENE STRUCTURE

Uehara et al. (1992) determined that the MDK gene contains 4 exons. The
5-prime flanking region adjacent to the start site contains 5 GC boxes,
a steroid/thyroid hormone receptor-binding site, and an A/T-rich island,
but there is no obvious CAAT box. Further upstream there is a region
with high GC content. The mouse Mdk gene has a similar organization,
with conservation of exons and significant homology in the 5-prime
region adjacent to the start site. There are 3 additional regions of
homology between mouse and human MDK in the 5-prime UTR.

MAPPING

By study of somatic cell hybrids, Eddy et al. (1991) demonstrated that
the MDK gene segregates concordantly with chromosome 11 and, using cell
hybrids carrying translocations involving chromosome 11, they mapped the
gene regionally to 11p13-p11. Kaname et al. (1993) mapped the MDK gene
to human chromosome 11p11.2 by fluorescence in situ hybridization.
Simon-Chazottes et al. (1992) mapped the mouse Mdk gene to chromosome 2,
using an interspecific backcross panel and microsatellite polymorphisms
as markers. O'Hara et al. (1995) used somatic cell hybrid analysis and
interspecific backcross analysis, respectively, to map human Mdk to
chromosome 11p13-p11 and mouse Mdk to a syntenic region of mouse
chromosome 2. They also mapped an Mdk pseudogene to mouse chromosome 11.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using microarray analysis, Ezquerra et al. (2005) found that aortae of
Mk -/- mice showed elevated expression of renin (REN; 179820),
angiotensinogen (106150), angiotensin II receptor-1 (AGTR1; 106165), and
angiotensin II receptor-2 (AGTR2; 300034) and decreased expression of
Ace.

;;PROTEIN KINASE, MITOGEN-ACTIVATED, KINASE 2; PRKMK2;;
MKK2; MAPKK2;;
MAPK/ERK KINASE 2; MEK2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Zheng and Guan (1993) isolated and sequenced 2 human cDNAs encoding
members of the MAP kinase kinase (MAP2K) family, designated MEK1
(176872) and MEK2 by them. The MEK2 cDNA encodes a predicted 400-amino
acid protein that shares 80% sequence identity with human MEK1.

Brott et al. (1993) cloned the mouse Mek2 gene.

GENE FUNCTION

Zheng and Guan (1993) showed that recombinant MEK2 and MEK1 both could
activate human ERK1 (601795) in vitro. They further characterized
biochemically the 2 MAP2Ks.

A virulence factor from Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, YopJ, is a 33-kD
protein that perturbs a multiplicity of signaling pathways. These
include inhibition of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase ERK,
c-jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAPK) pathways and inhibition of the nuclear factor kappa B
(NF-kappa-B; see 164011) pathway. The expression of YopJ has been
correlated with the induction of apoptosis by Yersinia. Using a yeast
2-hybrid screen based on a LexA-YopJ fusion protein and a HeLa cDNA
library, Orth et al. (1999) identified mammalian binding partners of
YopJ. These included the fusion proteins of the GAL4 activation domain
with MAPK kinases MKK1 (176872), MKK2, and MKK4/SEK1 (601335). YopJ was
found to bind directly to MKKs in vitro, including MKK1, MKK3 (602315),
MKK4, and MKK5 (602448). Binding of YopJ to the MKK blocked both
phosphorylation and subsequent activation of the MKKs. These results
explain the diverse activities of YopJ in inhibiting the ERK, JNK, p38,
and NF-kappa-B signaling pathways, preventing cytokine synthesis and
promoting apoptosis. YopJ-related proteins that are found in a number of
bacterial pathogens of animals and plants may function to block MKKs so
that host signaling responses can be modulated upon infection.

Mittal et al. (2006) found that the Yersinia YopJ virulence factor
inhibited the host inflammatory response and induced apoptosis of immune
cells by catalyzing acetylation of 2 ser residues in the activation loop
of MEK2, thereby blocking MEK2 activation and signal propagation. YopJ
also caused acetylation of a thr residue in the activation loop of both
IKKA (CHUK; 600664) and IKKB (IKBKB; 603258). Mittal et al. (2006)
concluded that ser/thr acetylation is a mode of action for bacterial
toxins that may also occur under nonpathogenic conditions to regulate
protein function.

Influenza A viruses are significant causes of morbidity and mortality
worldwide. Annually updated vaccines may prevent disease, and antivirals
are effective treatment early in disease when symptoms are often
nonspecific. Viral replication is supported by intracellular signaling
events. Using U0126, a nontoxic inhibitor of MEK1 and MEK2, and thus an
inhibitor of the RAF1 (164760)/MEK/ERK pathway (see Favata et al.
(1998)), Pleschka et al. (2001) examined the cellular response to
infection with influenza A. U0126 suppressed both the early and late ERK
activation phases after virus infection. Inhibition of the signaling
pathway occurred without impairing the synthesis of viral RNA or
protein, or the import of viral ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNP) into
the nucleus. Instead, U0126 inhibited RAF/MEK/ERK signaling and the
export of viral RNP without affecting the cellular mRNA export pathway.
Pleschka et al. (2001) proposed that ERK regulates a cellular factor
involved in the viral nuclear export protein function. They suggested
that local application of MEK inhibitors may have only minor toxic
effects on the host while inhibiting viral replication without giving
rise to drug-resistant virus variants.

Scholl et al. (2007) found that conditional deletion of either Mek1 or
Mek2 in mouse skin had no effect on epidermal development, but combined
Mek1/Mek2 deletion during embryonic development or in adulthood
abolished Erk1/Erk2 (MAPK1; 176948) phosphorylation and led to
hypoproliferation, apoptosis, skin barrier defects, and death.
Conversely, a single copy of either allele was sufficient for normal
development. Combined Mek1/Mek2 loss also abolished Raf-induced
hyperproliferation. To examine the effect of combined MEK deletion on
human skin, Scholl et al. (2007) used small interfering RNA to delete
MEK1 and MEK2 expression in normal primary human keratinocytes and used
these cells to regenerate human epidermal tissue on human dermis, which
was grafted onto immune-deficient mice. Control keratinocytes or those
lacking either MEK1 or MEK2 were able to regenerate 6 days after
grafting. In contrast, combined depletion of MEK1 and MEK2 led to either
graft failure or markedly hypoplastic epidermis that nonetheless
contained an intact stratum corneum. ERK2 expression rescued the defect.
Scholl et al. (2007) concluded that MEK1 and MEK2 are functionally
redundant in the epidermis and function in a linear relay in the MAPK
pathway.

MAPPING

Brott et al. (1993) mapped the mouse Mek2 gene to chromosome 10.

Puttagunta et al., (2000) constructed a cosmid/BAC map of human
chromosome 19p13.3 and localized over 50 genes, including MAP2K2, to the
contig. The 19p13.3 region shows syntenic homology with mouse chromosome
10.

Meloche et al. (2000) had erroneously mapped the MAP2K2 gene to 7q32.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Cardiofaciocutaneous Syndrome

In 23 patients with cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome (CFC4; 615280),
Rodriguez-Viciana et al. (2006) searched for mutations in downstream
effectors of RAS and found a missense mutation in MEK2 in 1 patient
(F57C; 601263.0001). The F57 codon of MEK2 is equivalent to codon F53 of
MEK1, which was mutated in another CFC patient (176872.0001).

In 3 (5.9%) of 51 CFC patients, Schulz et al. (2008) identified 2
different mutations in the MAP2K2 gene (F57V; 601263.0002 and Y134H;
601263.0003).

Rauen et al. (2010) and Linden and Price (2011) independently reported 2
unrelated families with autosomal dominant transmission of CFC due to
heterozygous mutations in the MAP2K2 gene (P128Q, 601263.0004 and G132D,
601263.0005, respectively).

- Somatic Mutations

Nikolaev et al. (2012) performed exome sequencing to detect somatic
mutations in protein-coding regions in 7 melanoma cell lines and
donor-matched germline cells. All melanoma samples had high numbers of
somatic mutations, which showed the hallmark of UV-induced DNA repair.
Such a hallmark was absent in tumor sample-specific mutations in 2
metastases derived from the same individual. Two melanomas with
noncanonical BRAF mutations harbored gain-of-function MAP2K1 (MEK1;
176872) and MAP2K2 mutations, resulting in constitutive ERK
phosphorylation and higher resistance to MEK inhibitors. Screening a
larger cohort of individuals with melanoma revealed the presence of
recurring somatic MAP2K1 and MAP2K2 mutations, which occurred at an
overall frequency of 8%.

ANIMAL MODEL

Belanger et al. (2003) developed Mek2-deficient mice. Mutant mice were
viable and fertile and showed no phenotypic abnormalities. Mutant
embryonic fibroblasts and purified lymphocytes proliferated normally,
demonstrating that Mek2 is not required for reentry into the cell cycle
or for T-cell development. Belanger et al. (2003) concluded that MEK1
can compensate for a lack of MEK2 function.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CARDIOFACIOCUTANEOUS SYNDROME 4
MAP2K2, PHE57CYS

In a patient with cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome (CFC4; 615280),
Rodriguez-Viciana et al. (2006) identified a T-to-G transversion at
nucleotide 170 of the MEK2 gene, resulting in a
phenylalanine-to-cysteine substitution at codon 57 (F57C).

By in vitro studies, Senawong et al. (2008) found that MEK1 mutants F53S
(176872.0001) and Y130C (176872.0002) and the MEK2 mutant F57C could not
induce ERK signaling unless phosphorylated by RAF at 2 homologous serine
residues in the regulatory loop. When these serine residues were
replaced with alanines, ERK phosphorylation was significantly reduced in
the presence of RAF. However, the F57C MEK2 mutant was less dependent on
RAF signaling than the other mutants. This difference resulted in F57C
MEK2 being resistant to the selective RAF inhibitor SB-590885. However,
all 3 mutants were sensitive to the MEK inhibitor U0126. Senawong et al.
(2008) suggested that MEK inhibition could have potential therapeutic
value in CFC.

.0002
CARDIOFACIOCUTANEOUS SYNDROME 4
MAP2K2, PHE57VAL

In 2 patients with cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome (CFC4; 615280), Schulz
et al. (2008) identified a heterozygous de novo 169T-G transversion in
exon 2 of the MAP2K2 gene, resulting in a phe57-to-val (F57V)
substitution. This same codon is affected in F57C (601263.0001). Both
patients had a unique facial phenotype with a long narrow face, tall
forehead, low-set ears, severe ptosis, epicanthal folds, and prominent
supraorbital ridges.

.0003
CARDIOFACIOCUTANEOUS SYNDROME 4
MAP2K2, TYR134HIS

In a patient with CFC (CFC4; 615280), Schulz et al. (2008) identified a
heterozygous 400T-C transition in exon 3 of the MAP2K2 gene, resulting
in a tyr134-to-his (Y134H) substitution.

.0004
CARDIOFACIOCUTANEOUS SYNDROME 4
MAP2K2, PRO128GLN

In affected members of a 4-generation Caucasian Cajun family with CFC
(CFC4; 615280), Rauen et al. (2010) identified a heterozygous 383C-A
transversion in exon 3 of the MAP2K2 gene, resulting in a pro128-to-gln
(P128Q) substitution. In vitro functional expression studies showed that
the mutant protein had increased kinase activity, but not as much as
other CFC-associated MAP2K2 mutations (e.g., F57C; 601263.0001), and was
considered a weak hypermorphic mutation. This was the first reported
case of vertical transmission of a MAP2K2 mutation in CFC. The phenotype
was variable, and included the classic craniofacial features, pulmonic
stenosis, ectodermal abnormalities, and variable degrees of learning
delays and disabilities. One of the mutation carriers died of acute
lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) at age 41 years, which the authors postulated
may have resulted from increased activity of the RAS pathway.

.0005
CARDIOFACIOCUTANEOUS SYNDROME 4
MAP2K2, GLY132ASP

In a mother and her 2 sons with CFC4 (615280), Linden and Price (2011)
identified a heterozygous 395G-A transition in exon 3 of the MAP2K2
gene, resulting in a gly132-to-asp (G132D) substitution in a conserved
residue. The proband was a 46-year-old man with mildly delayed
development, pulmonary stenosis as a child, myopia, short stature,
tightly curled short hair, absent eyebrows, hyperelastic skin, and
multiple lentigines. His 40-year-old brother and 68-year-old mother had
similar features. Linden and Price (2011) emphasized the rarity of
autosomal dominant transmission of CFC, and noted that the mild
cognitive phenotype in these patients suggests greater reproductive
success.

;;PROTEASE 26S, SUBUNIT 9; S9;;
p44.5
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The PSMD11 gene encodes a non-ATPase subunit of the PA700 regulatory
subcomplex of the 26S proteasome. The 26S proteasome is responsible for
the ATP-dependent degradation of a variety of cellular proteins.
Selective breakdown of these proteins is mediated by the ubiquitin
pathway. The 26S proteasome is a 2,000-kD protein complex composed of
the 20S proteasome, which is the catalytic subcomplex, and PA700, which
is the regulatory subcomplex. The approximately 700-kD PA700 complex
consists of approximately 20 heterogeneous proteins ranging from 25 to
112 kD. These subunits can be divided into 2 classes, those that are
members of the AAA (ATPases associated with various cellular activities)
family and those that are not (summary by Hoffman and Rechsteiner, 1997,
Saito et al., 1997).

CLONING

Hoffman and Rechsteiner (1997) sequenced peptides from subunit 9 of the
human 26S proteasome. Using the amino acid sequences, they cloned HeLa
cell cDNAs encoding subunit 9, also called PSMD11. The predicted
422-amino acid protein has 9 dileucine repeats, possible coiled-coil
domains, and potential myristylation and phosphorylation sites. PSMD11
is not a member of the ATPase family. Whereas the calculated molecular
mass of PSMD11 is 47,469 Da, it migrates as an approximately 46-kD
protein on SDS-polyacrylamide gels.

Saito et al. (1997) sequenced peptides from the p44.5 subunit of the
bovine PA700 complex. They identified human ESTs encoding homologous
proteins and used these ESTs to isolate hepatoblastoma HepG2 cell cDNAs
encoding human p44.5. The authors stated that the p44.5 subunit is
equivalent to subunit 9 (Hoffman and Rechsteiner, 1997), or PSMD11.
Saito et al. (1997) identified a putative S. cerevisiae homolog, which
they named NAS4, that shares 45.4% amino acid sequence identity with
PSMD11. Disruption of the NAS4 gene resulted in lethality.

GENE FUNCTION

Vilchez et al. (2012) demonstrated that human embryonic stem cells
exhibit high proteasome activity that is correlated with increased
levels of the 19S proteasome subunit PSMD11 and a corresponding
increased assembly of the 26S/30S proteasome. Ectopic expression of
PSMD11 is sufficient to increase proteasome assembly and activity. FOXO4
(300033), an insulin/insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF1;
147440)-responsive transcription factor associated with long lifespan in
invertebrates, regulates proteasome activity by modulating the
expression of PSMD11 in human embryonic stem cells. Proteasome
inhibition in human embryonic stem cells affects the expression of
pluripotency markers and the levels of specific markers of the distinct
germ layers. Vilchez et al. (2012) concluded that their results
suggested a new regulation of proteostasis in human embryonic stem cells
that links longevity and stress resistance in invertebrates to human
embryonic stem cell function and identity.

Bidirectional transport of macromolecules between the cytoplasm and

nuclear envelope. NPCs are composed of subcomplexes, and SEH1L is part
of one such subcomplex, Nup107-160 (Loiodice et al., 2004).

CLONING

By proteomic analysis and mass spectrometry, Cronshaw et al. (2002)
identified 94 proteins associated with NPCs purified from rat liver
nuclei. Seh1l, which they referred to as Sec13l and Seh1, was abundant,
with 16 to 32 copies per NPC. By database analysis, Cronshaw et al.
(2002) identified the deduced amino acid sequence of human SEH1L, which
contains WD repeats and has a calculated molecular mass of 40 kD. SEH1L
shares 34% amino acid identity with yeast Seh1 and 30% identity with
yeast Sec13 (600152). Transient transfection of fluorescence-tagged
SEH1L in HeLa cells resulted in punctate rim localization typical of
nucleoporins.

GENE FUNCTION

Loiodice et al. (2004) found that SEH1L was loosely associated with the
Nup107-160 complex biochemically. SEH1L depletion by RNA interference
led to phenotypes similar to knockdown of other constituents of this
complex, including delocalization of some nucleoporins from the nuclear
envelope. All constituents of the Nup107-160 complex, including SEH1L,
were targeted to kinetochores from prophase to anaphase during mitosis.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Nup85 (170285) and Seh1 constitute a module
in the heptameric Nup84 (NUP107) complex. Brohawn et al. (2008)
determined the structure of a complex of S. cerevisiae Nup85 residues 1
to 564 (of 744) and intact Seh1 at 3.5-angstrom resolution. Structural,
biochemical, and genetic analyses positioned the Nup84 complex in 2
peripheral nuclear pore complex rings. Brohawn et al. (2008) established
a conserved tripartite element, the ancestral coatomer element ACE1,
that reoccurs in several nucleoporins and vesicle coat proteins,
providing structural evidence of coevolution from a common ancestor.
They identified interactions that define the organization of the Nup84
complex on the basis of comparison with vesicle coats and confirmed the
sites by mutagenesis. Brohawn et al. (2008) proposed that the nuclear
pore complex scaffold, like vesicle coats, is composed of polygons with
vertices and edges forming a membrane-proximal lattice that provides
docking sites for additional nucleoporins.

MAPPING

Hartz (2005) mapped the SEH1L gene to chromosome 18p11.21 based on an
alignment of the SEH1L sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF136976) with the
genomic sequence.

DESCRIPTION 
MAPPING

Cannizzaro et al. (1993) mapped a member of the KOX gene family, ZNF23
(KOX16), to 16q22 by in situ hybridization. The map location is near 2
fragile sites, FRA16B and FRA16C. The 16q22 region is involved,
furthermore, in chromosomal alterations characteristic of acute myeloid
leukemia. The ZNF19 gene (194525) maps to the same region. Analogous
genes in the mouse map to chromosome 8 in a region of syntenic homology.
By pulsed field gel electrophoresis experiments, Rousseau-Merck et al.
(1993) showed that the ZNF19 and ZNF23 genes lie within a 200-300 kb DNA
fragment.

604926	TITLE *604926 PHOSPHATE CYTIDYLYLTRANSFERASE 1, CHOLINE, BETA ISOFORM; PCYT1B
DESCRIPTION CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CT; EC 2.7.7.15) is a key
regulator of phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis; see PCYT1A (123695).

By searching EST databases for CT-like cDNAs, Lykidis et al. (1998)
identified a sequence encoding PCYT1B. Sequence analysis of the deduced
330-amino acid protein showed that the catalytic core and helical domain
of PCYT1B are nearly identical to those of PCYT1A. The N-terminal
domain, however, lacks the nuclear localization motif found in PCYT1A.
The C terminus of PCYT1B is shorter than that of PCYT1A and has only 3
rather than the 16 serine residues of PCYT1A that are potential
phosphorylation sites. Northern blot analysis revealed ubiquitous
expression of approximately 6.5-, 1.9-, and 1.1-kb PCYT1B transcripts
that were most abundant in testis, placenta, brain, ovary, and all fetal
tissues tested. Like PCYT1A, PCYT1B has CT activity that is dependent on
the presence of stimulatory lipids. SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analyses
indicated that PCYT1B is expressed both as a 35-kD and a 42-kD protein,
with an apparent posttranslational modification of the first 26 amino
acids accounting for expression of the second form. Immunofluorescence
microscopy showed that PCYT1B is localized in the cytoplasm.

;;KENAE
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using Isaac syndrome patient serum to immunoscreen an NB-1 human
neuroblastoma cell cDNA library, followed by 5-prime RACE, Araya et al.
(2009) cloned full-length CCDC125, which they called Kenae. The deduced
511-amino acid protein has 4 coiled-coil domains. Real-time PCR detected
variable Ccdc125 expression in all mouse tissues examined, with highest
expression in thymus, spleen, and bone marrow. Epitope-tagged CCDC125
localized to the cytoplasm of transfected HEK293 cells. Orthologs of
CCDC125 were detected only in vertebrates.

GENE FUNCTION

By overexpression in HEK293 cells, Araya et al. (2009) showed that
CCDC125 inhibited migration in a wound healing cell migration assay.
CCDC125 both increased constitutive activation of the small GTPases RHOA
(165390), RAC1 (602048), and CDC42 (116952) and reduced their
responsiveness to extracellular stimuli. CCDC125 did not appear to
directly bind the small GTPases.

MAPPING

Hartz (2011) mapped the CCDC125 gene to chromosome 5q13.2 based on an
alignment of the CCDC125 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AL832658) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

608613	TITLE *608613 TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR Sp6; SP6
;;KRUPPEL-LIKE FACTOR 14; KLF14;;
EPIPROFIN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SP6 belongs to a family of transcription factors that contain 3
classical zinc finger DNA-binding domains consisting of a zinc atom
tetrahedrally coordinated by 2 cysteines and 2 histidines (C2H2 motif).
These transcription factors bind to GC-rich sequences and related GT and
CACCC boxes (Scohy et al., 2000).

CLONING

By searching for sequences related to the zinc finger DNA-binding domain
of SP1 (189906), followed by screening a fetal mouse liver cDNA library,
Scohy et al. (2000) cloned mouse Sp6, which they designated Klf14. By
database analysis, they identified human SP6. Mouse and human SP6 encode
deduced 376-amino acid proteins that share 96% amino acid identity.
Residues within each of the 3 zinc fingers that establish specific
contacts with DNA are completely conserved in SP6, suggesting that mouse
and human SP6 recognize a classical GC box. RT-PCR analysis revealed SP6
expression in all mouse tissues examined.

Nakamura et al. (2004) cloned mouse Sp6, which they called epiprofin.
The 5-prime sequence of mouse epiprofin differs from the sequence
reported by Scohy et al. (2000) and shares 80% identity with the 5-prime
sequence of human SP6. The Sp6 open reading frames reported by Nakamura
et al. (2004) and Scohy et al. (2000) are identical. Nakamura et al.
(2004) identified 2 C-terminal nuclear localization signals in the Sp6
protein. Northern blot analysis of several mouse tissues detected a
3.6-kb transcript only in newborn mouse molar RNA. RT-PCR analysis
detected expression in newborn mouse molar and incisor RNA, with faint
expression in skin, but not in any other tissue. In situ hybridization
of developing mouse embryos revealed epiprofin expressed primarily by
proliferating epithelial cells of teeth, hair follicles, developing
limbs, and the posterior neuropore. Fluorescence-labeled epiprofin
localized to the nucleus of transfected COS-7 cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Nakamura et al. (2004) determined that endogenous epiprofin expressed by
primary mouse dental epithelial cells and epiprofin expressed by
transfected COS-7 cells promoted cell proliferation. Transfection of an
N-terminally truncated vector containing only the zinc finger domain
resulted in no activity.

GENE STRUCTURE

Scohy et al. (2000) determined that the mouse and human SP6 genes
contain 2 exons. Exon 1 contains a potential ATG translation initiator
codon and an upstream TATAA box. Exon 2 contains a second potential ATG
start codon. Both potential initiator codons are in-frame with the zinc
finger protein sequence.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid analysis and FISH, Scohy et al. (2000) mapped the
SP6 gene to chromosome 17q21.3-q22.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Small et al. (2011) showed that the lipid phenotype-associated
cis-acting expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL), represented by
dbSNP rs4731702, of the maternally expressed transcription factor KLF14
is a master trans regulator of adipose gene expression. Expression
levels of genes regulated by this trans-eQTL were highly correlated with
concurrently measured metabolic traits, and a subset of the
trans-regulated genes harbored variants directly associated with
metabolic phenotypes.

600626	TITLE *600626 LECTIN, GALACTOSIDE-BINDING, SOLUBLE, 3 BINDING PROTEIN; LGALS3BP
;;MAC2-BINDING PROTEIN; MAC2BP;;
SERUM PROTEIN 90K; 90K;;
L3 ANTIGEN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using the monoclonal antibody SP-2, Iacobelli et al. (1986), Iacobelli
et al. (1988), and Iacobelli et al. (1993) identified a 90-kD protein,
designated serum protein 90K, that was found at elevated concentrations
in the serum of patients with various types of breast, lung, colorectal,
ovary, and endometrial cancer. Koths et al. (1993) cloned a cDNA
encoding 90K, which they called MAC2BP, from a human monocytic cell line
cDNA library using degenerate PCR primers based on the protein sequence.
MAC2BP is a 585-amino acid protein containing an N-terminal region that
is 45% identical to the extracellular, cysteine-rich domain of
macrophage scavenger receptor (MSR1; 153622), indicating that MAC2BP is
a member of the MSR1 superfamily. Koths et al. (1993) showed by
immunoblotting that breast milk, serum, semen, saliva, urine, and tears
likely contain MAC2B.

Ullrich et al. (1994) found by Northern blot analysis that all examined
normal tissues, with the exception of peripheral blood lymphocytes,
contain high levels of a 2.2-kb 90K transcript, with the highest levels
present in the gastrointestinal tissues. They also showed that primary
tumor samples and tumor cell lines express the 90K transcript at widely
varying levels.

GENE FUNCTION

Koths et al. (1993) found that MAC2BP specifically bound the human
macrophage-associated lectin LGALS3 (153619) via a carbohydrate-specific
interaction.

Ullrich et al. (1994) noted that 90K is present at elevated levels in
the serum of subpopulations of patients with AIDS. They demonstrated
that 90K could stimulate host defense systems, such as natural killer
cell and lymphokine-activated killer cell activities, and could induce
secretion of interleukin-2 (IL2; 147680). Ullrich et al. (1994)
suggested that oncogenic transformation, viral infection, or invasion by
pathogens enhances the production of 90K, which then stimulates the host
immune system via induction of IL2 and possibly other cytokines.

Using affinity chromatography and mass spectrometric analysis, Nonaka et
al. (2011) identified MAC2BP as a ligand for the lectin receptor DCSIGN
(CD209; 604672). DCSIGN recognized MAC2BP derived from some colorectal
carcinomas, but not from others. Recognition depended on the presence of
alpha-1,3,4-fucose moieties of Le glycans expressed on DCSIGN-binding
MAC2BP.

MAPPING

Calabrese et al. (1995) mapped the human 90K gene to chromosome 17q25 by
FISH. Brakebusch et al. (1997) used FISH to localize the mouse 90K gene
to chromosome 11, region E.
