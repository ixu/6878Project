600481	TITLE *600481 STEROL REGULATORY ELEMENT-BINDING TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR 2; SREBF2
;;STEROL REGULATORY ELEMENT-BINDING PROTEIN 2; SREBP2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The sterol regulatory element (SRE)-binding protein-2 (SREBP2) is
structurally related to SREBP1 (SREBF1; 184756), and both control
cholesterol homeostasis by stimulating transcription of sterol-regulated
genes (summary by Osborne, 2001).

CLONING

Hua et al. (1993) cloned SREBF2 from a HeLa cell cDNA library. The
deduced 1,141-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 124
kD. SREBF2 has an acidic N-terminal domain, a basic helix-loop-helix
leucine zipper (bHLH-ZIP) motif, and a long C terminus. It also has
histidine, glutamic acid, and arginine residues implicated in DNA
recognition by other bHLH-ZIP proteins. SREBF2 and SREBF1 share 47%
amino acid identity overall and 71% identity in the bHLH-ZIP region.
Northern blot analysis revealed a major SREBF2 transcript of 5.2 kb in
all tissues examined. A minor transcript of about 4.2 kb was also
observed.

Miserez et al. (1997) found that SREBP2 was expressed ubiquitously as 2
mRNAs (4.2 and 5.2 kb) that differ in their 3-prime untranslated regions
because of different polyadenylation signals.

GENE STRUCTURE

Miserez et al. (1997) found that the SREBF2 gene contains 19 exons and
spans 72 kb, with a sterol regulatory element in the promoter region.

MAPPING

Hua et al. (1995) isolated a genomic cosmid clone for SREBF2 and mapped
the gene to 22q13 by analysis of human/rodent somatic cell hybrids and
fluorescence in situ hybridization.

GENE FUNCTION

By transfection of human 293 cells, Hua et al. (1993) found that SREBF2,
like SREBF1, drove transcription from a reporter gene containing SRE1 in
both the presence or absence of sterols.

Cholesterol homeostasis in animal cells is achieved by regulated
cleavage of SREBPs, membrane-bound transcription factors. Proteolytic
release of the active domains of SREBPs from membranes requires a
sterol-sensing protein called SCAP (601510), which forms a complex with
SREBPs. In sterol-depleted cells, DeBose-Boyd et al. (1999) found that
SCAP escorts SREBPs from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi,
where SREBPs are cleaved by site-1 protease (S1P; 603355). The authors
showed that sterols block this transport and abolish cleavage.
Relocating active S1P from Golgi to ER by treating cells with brefeldin
A or by fusing the ER retention signal KDEL to S1P obviated the SCAP
requirement and rendered cleavage insensitive to sterols. DeBose-Boyd et
al. (1999) concluded that transport-dependent proteolysis may be a
common mechanism to regulate the processing of membrane proteins.

Shimano et al. (1997) concluded that SREBP2 can replace SREBP1 in
regulating cholesterol synthesis in livers of mice and that the higher
potency of SREBP2 leads to excessive hepatic cholesterol synthesis in
these animals.

See review by Osborne (2001).

Najafi-Shoushtari et al. (2010) and Rayner et al. (2010) found that the
microRNA miR33 (612156) embedded within intron 16 of the SREBP2 gene
plays a role in control of cholesterol homeostasis through
posttranscriptional repression of the adenosine triphosphate-binding
cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1; 600046).

Jeon et al. (2008) found that the nuclear level of hepatic Srebp2 was
elevated in mice fed a diet supplemented with lovastatin and ezetimibe
(L/E) to limit dietary sterol absorption and reduce HMG-CoA reductase
(HMGCR; 142910) activity. Genomic promoter-wide ChIP-chip analysis
revealed that Srebp2 bound a number of promoters for genes encoding
bitter taste-responding type-2 taste receptors (T2Rs; see 604867), which
are expressed in gut enteroendocrine cells and in the tongue and oral
cavity. Sterol depletion in the mouse enteroendocrine cell line STC-1,
or expression of human SREBP2 in STC-1 cells, led to increased T2R
expression. T2R expression was also increased in the proximal small
intestine of L/E-treated mice. In contrast, T2R expression in the tongue
was not induced by L/E feeding. Jeon et al. (2008) proposed that a low
cholesterol diet may induce SREBP2-mediated activation of bitter
signaling in the gut to prevent absorption of potentially toxic bitter
substances in plant-derived foods, in addition to maximizing lipid
uptake.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Lee et al. (2003) showed the crystal structure of importin-beta (see
602738) complexed with the active form of SREBP2. Importin-beta uses
characteristic long helices like a pair of chopsticks to interact with
an SREBP2 dimer. Importin-beta changes its conformation to reveal a
pseudo-2-fold symmetry on its surface structure so that it can
accommodate a symmetric dimer molecule.

EVOLUTION

Najafi-Shoushtari et al. (2010) identified the MIR33A gene within intron
16 of the SREBP2 gene. Brown et al. (2010) noted that the precursor for
mature miR33A is found within the same intron of SREBP2 from many animal
species, including large and small mammals, chickens, and frogs. There
is even a perfectly conserved mature form of miR33A in the single
SREBP-like gene of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. The latter is
most remarkable because insects do not synthesize sterols; their single
SREBP gene controls fatty acid production. Moreover, the fruit fly
genome does not contain ABCA1. While miR33A exhibits uniform
conservation, miR33B (613486), present in intron 17 of the SREBP1 gene
(184756), is present only in large mammals.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Yang et al. (1994) found a mutation in SREBF2 in a mutant CHO cell line
that is resistant to transcriptional repression by
25-hydroxycholesterol. The truncated gene product activates the LDL
receptor (606945) and HMG-CoA synthase (142940) genes independent of
sterols. The authors speculated that mutations or polymorphisms in
SREBF1 or SREBF2 could explain in part the wide variation in levels of
LDL-cholesterol seen in the general population.

Muller and Miserez (2002) presented evidence suggesting that mutations
in the SREBF2 gene are associated with hypercholesterolemia in man.

ANIMAL MODEL

In Abcg5 (605459)/Abcg8 (605460)-deficient mice, Yang et al. (2004)
demonstrated that accumulation of plant sterols perturbed cholesterol
homeostasis in the adrenal gland, with a 91% reduction in its
cholesterol content. Despite very low cholesterol levels, there was no
compensatory increase in cholesterol synthesis or in lipoprotein
receptor expression. Adrenal cholesterol levels returned to near-normal
levels in mice treated with ezetimibe, which blocks phytosterol
absorption. In cultured adrenal cells, stigmasterol but not sitosterol
inhibited SREBF2 processing and reduced cholesterol synthesis;
stigmasterol also activated the liver X receptor (see LXRA; 602423) in a
cell-based reporter assay. Yang et al. (2004) concluded that selected
dietary plant sterols disrupt cholesterol homeostasis by affecting 2
critical regulatory pathways of lipid metabolism.

Lens opacity-13 (lop13) is a spontaneous autosomal recessive mouse
mutant that exhibits nuclear cataracts. Merath et al. (2011) found that
mature cataracts developed in lop13 mice by 10 weeks of age and that
hypermature cataracts developed by 3 months of age. Histologic analysis
of lop13 eyes revealed swollen lens fiber cells and the presence of
bladder cells within the lens cortex, as well as morgagnian globules and
liquefied material at the lens posterior. Lens epithelial cells at the
anterior of the lens were normal. Lop13 mice also developed persistent
skin wounds at around 3 months of age, although lop13 skin was
indistinguishable from wildtype. Sequence analysis revealed a 3112C-T
mutation in exon 18 of the Srebf2 gene in lop13 mice, resulting in the
substitution of a highly conserved arginine within the Srebf2 regulatory
domain with cysteine (R1038C). Biochemical analysis revealed
significantly decreased cholesterol levels in lop13 brain and liver
compared with wildtype; however, serum cholesterol levels were normal.
Knockout of Srebf2 resulted in early embryonic lethality, but Srebf2 +/-
mice appeared normal. Since the adult ocular lens is nonvascularized,
Merath et al. (2011) hypothesized that SREBF2 and de novo cholesterol
synthesis are essential for normal lens function.

;;EIF3-p110;;
EUKARYOTIC TRANSLATION INITIATION FACTOR 3, SUBUNIT 8, FORMERLY; EIF3S8,
FORMERLY
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Eukaryotic initiation factor-3 (eIF3) is the largest of the eIFs and
consists of at least 10 nonidentical subunits, including EIF2C (Asano et
al., 1997).

CLONING

Asano et al. (1997) demonstrated that the 115-kD component of HeLa cell
eIF3 is actually composed of 2 proteins, p116 (PRT1; 603917) and p110.
By screening a HeLa cell expression library with antibodies against the
115-kD band, these authors identified cDNAs encoding p110. The predicted
913-amino acid p110 protein has a pI of 5.8 and is unrelated to p116.
p110 shares 31% identity to the S. cerevisiae Nip1 protein, which is
thought to be involved in nuclear import and the initiation phase of
protein synthesis. Asano et al. (1997) found that the p116, p110, and
p36 (603911) subunits localize on 40S ribosomes in cells active in
translation and coimmunoprecipitate with p170 (602039), indicating that
these proteins are integral components of eIF3. Northern blot analysis
revealed that p110 is expressed as a 3-kb mRNA.

GENE FUNCTION

By reciprocal yeast 2-hybrid and coimmunoprecipitation analyses of the
human STS26T malignant schwannoma cell line, Scoles et al. (2006) showed
that isoforms 1 and 2 of schwannomin (NF2; 607379) interacted with
EIF3C. Mutation analysis revealed that the FERM domain of schwannomin
interacted with the C-terminal half of EIF3C. Immunofluorescence
microscopy of STS26T cells showed that the 2 proteins partly colocalized
at punctate perinuclear structures and at some membranous structures.
Overexpression of EIF3C in STS26T cells elevated cell proliferation, and
schwannomin countered this effect. Western blot analysis revealed an
inverse abundance of schwannomin and EIF3C in human meningiomas.

MAPPING

Gross (2011) mapped the EIF3C gene to chromosome 16p11.2 based on an
alignment of the EIF3C sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC000533) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37). A nearly identical copy of EIF3C, designated
EIF3CL, also maps to chromosome 16p11.2.

608965	TITLE *608965 CALCIUM-BINDING PROTEIN 4; CABP4
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching databases for sequences similar to CABPs, Haeseleer et al.
(2000) identified a CABP4 genomic clone. Like other CABP family members,
the deduced CABP4 protein contains 4 EF-hand motifs.

Haeseleer et al. (2004) obtained a full-length human CABP4 cDNA by PCR
of a retina cDNA library. The deduced 275-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 30.4 kD. Haeseleer et al. (2004) noted that
the second EF-hand motif of CABP4 cannot coordinate Ca(2+) because the
lysine residue in position 1 is not suitable for Ca(2+) coordination.
Human, bovine, mouse, and rat CABP4 are highly homologous in their
C-terminal regions, but are less conserved in their N-terminal regions.
Northern blot analysis of several human tissues and rat retina and brain
detected 1.6- and 3.8-kb transcripts only in retina. RT-PCR of mouse
tissues detected expression only in retina. In situ hybridization and
immunocytochemical analysis of monkey retina detected Cabp4 only in
photoreceptors. Analysis of mouse retina found Cabp4 in rod spherules
and cone pedicles, where it colocalized with synaptic vesicle proteins.

GENE FUNCTION

Haeseleer et al. (2004) found that CABP4 associated with the C-terminal
domain of Ca(V)4.1 alpha-1 (CACNA1F; 300110) and shifted the activation
of the channel to hyperpolarized voltages following cotransfection in
human embryonic kidney cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Haeseleer et al. (2000) determined that the CABP4 gene contains 6 exons.
Haeseleer et al. (2004) determined that the CABP4 gene spans about 4 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Haeseleer et al. (2004) mapped the CABP4
gene to chromosome 11q13.1. CABP4 lies in the opposite orientation and
is separated from CABP2 (607314) by 4 genes and about 60 kb.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Zeitz et al. (2006) used the candidate gene approach to search for
molecular defects in patients with incomplete congenital stationary
night blindness without mutations in the CACNA1F gene (300110). Both the
CACNA1F protein (Cav1.4-alpha) and CABP4 are members of the CABP protein
family, which are neuronal Ca(2+)-binding proteins with similarity to
calmodulin (CALM1; 114180) and modulate voltage-dependent Ca(2+)
channels. Like Cav1.4-alpha, CABP4 is specifically located in
photoreceptor synaptic terminals, where it is directly associated with
the C-terminal domain of Cav1.4-alpha and shifts the activation of
Cav1.4 to hyperpolarized voltages in transfected cells. Mice lacking
Cabp4 showed a thinner outer plexiform layer, which, in wildtype mice,
contains the synapses between the photoreceptor and secondary neurons.
Electroretinography (ERG) studies indicated a reduction in cone and rod
synaptic function (Maeda et al., 2005). Similar morphologic and
functional alterations were observed in the retinas of Cacna1f-mutant
mice (Mansergh et al., 2005). These studies prompted Zeitz et al. (2006)
to study CABP4 as a possible site of mutations in autosomal recessive
CSNB. They identified CABP4 mutations in CABP4 in 2 families with
autosomal recessive incomplete congenital stationary night blindness
(CSNB2B; 610427).

ANIMAL MODEL

Haeseleer et al. (2004) developed Cabp4-null mice. The outer plexiform
layer, which contains the photoreceptor synapses with secondary neurons,
was thinner in mutant mice than in control mice. Cabp4 -/- retinas had
ectopic synapses originating from rod bipolar and horizontal cells that
extended into the outer nuclear layer. Rod bipolars were reduced in
sensitivity about 100-fold, and electroretinograms indicated reduced
cone and rod synaptic function. The phenotype of Cabp4-null mice was
similar to that of patients with incomplete congenital stationary night
blindness (300071).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
NIGHT BLINDNESS, CONGENITAL STATIONARY, TYPE 2B
CABP4, 2-BP DEL, 800AG

In 2 families with autosomal recessive incomplete congenital stationary
night blindness (CSNB2B; 610427), Zeitz et al. (2006) found a 2-bp
deletion, 800_801delAG, at the junction of intron 5 and exon 6 of the
CABP4 gene. The mutation occurred in homozygosity in 1 family and in
compound heterozygosity in the second family. The wildtype sequence of
CABP4 comprises a duplicate AG dinucleotide at the junction of intron 5
and exon 6. The 2-bp deletion removed 1 of the AG dinucleotides and,
thus, was predicted to cause a translational frameshift, or affect
transcript splicing by altering the acceptor site. A computational
search led to the conclusion that deletion of 1 of the 2 tandem AG
nucleotides may not dramatically alter splicing efficiency. RT-PCR
experiments indicated that the deletion did not cause aberrant splicing
of CABP4. Both families in whom the 2-bp deletion was demonstrated were
of Swiss extraction. The deletion mutation was located on the same
haplotype, suggesting a common origin. Family A had 2 affected sibs who
presented nystagmus and decreased visual acuity in early childhood. The
2 brothers were 39 and 45 years of age at the time of recent
examination. The index patient was the only affected member of the
second family in which the 2-bp deletion was present, in compound
heterozygosity with a missense mutation (608965.0002).

NIGHT BLINDNESS, CONGENITAL STATIONARY, TYPE 2B

In the second family with CSNB2B (610427) studied by Zeitz et al.
(2006), heterozygosity was found for the 2-bp deletion (608965.0001) and
a 370C-T substitution in exon 2 of the CABP4 gene, which was predicted
to introduce a binding site for SRp55 (601944), influencing splicing, or
to lead to an amino acid exchange (R124C). The patient exhibited CABP4
transcript levels 30 to 40% of those found in controls.

;;ARI2;;
TRIAD DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1; TRIAD1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Zinc-binding cysteine and histidine residues that form a 3-dimensional
structure, stabilized by zinc, are found in protein-interacting motifs
in LIM (e.g., LMO1; 186921), RING (e.g., RING1; 602045), or LAP (e.g.,
AF10; 602409) finger-containing proteins. Van der Reijden et al. (1999)
identified ARIH2, which they termed TRIAD1, a 493-amino acid nuclear
protein upregulated during retinoic acid-induced granulocytic
differentiation of acute promyelocytic leukemia cells. ARIH2 contains 2
RING fingers flanking a conserved cysteine-rich (C6HC) domain the
authors designated DRIL (double RING finger-linked domain); 2 C-terminal
coiled-coil domains; and an acidic N-terminal region. The DRIL domain
with its 2 flanking RING fingers, collectively referred to by the
authors as the TRIAD (2 RING fingers and DRIL) domain, spans
approximately 200 amino acids and was identified, with a preserved order
and distance, in more than 20 eukaryotic proteins.

MAPPING

604846	TITLE *604846 HEPARAN SULFATE 6-O-SULFOTRANSFERASE 1; HS6ST1
;;HS6ST
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Heparan sulfate (HS) 6-O-sulfotransferase catalyzes the transfer of
sulfate from 3-prime-phosphoadenosine 5-prime-phosphosulfate to position
6 of the N-sulfoglucosamine residue of heparan sulfate (Habuchi et al.,
1998).

CLONING

By screening a human fetal brain cDNA library with a Chinese hamster
Hs6st cDNA, Habuchi et al. (1998) isolated human HS6ST cDNAs. The
predicted 401-amino acid human HS6ST protein is a type II transmembrane
protein, with an N-terminal transmembrane domain. A putative cleavage
site occurs near the C-terminal end of the transmembrane domain. HS6ST
contains 2 potential N-glycosylation sites. It does not share
significant sequence similarity to other known sulfotransferases,
including HS2ST. HS6ST does not contain a conserved
3-prime-phosphoadenosine 5-prime-phosphosulfate-binding site sequence,
or a 'P-loop,' which is found in most sulfotransferases and has been
implicated as an ATP- or GTP-binding site. Northern blot analysis of
human fetal brain RNA detected a 3.9-kb HS6ST transcript.

Habuchi et al. (2000) cloned Hs6st1 from a mouse brain cDNA library. The
deduced 401-amino acid protein has characteristics of a type II
transmembrane protein, with a short N-terminal segment followed by a
hydrophobic sequence. It also contains 2 N-glycosylation sites. Northern
blot analysis detected a 3.9-kb Hs6st1 transcript in most mouse tissues
examined, with predominant expression in liver.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the HS6ST1
gene to chromosome 2 (TMAP RH78052).

GENE FUNCTION

Habuchi et al. (1998) found that recombinant HS6ST expressed in
mammalian cells exhibited HS6ST activity.

Habuchi et al. (2000) demonstrated elevated 6-O-sulfotransferase
activity in the cytoplasm of COS-7 cells transfected with mouse Hs6st1.
Hs6st1 was also secreted into the medium. Hs6st1 showed
6-O-sulfotransferase activity against HS, N-sulfated heparosan, heparin,
and some HS derivatives. It did not show sulfotransferase activity
toward other glycosaminoglycans examined.

In experiments in C. elegans, Tornberg et al. (2011) observed that HS
cell-specifically regulates neural branching in vivo in concert with
other genes that are associated with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (see
147950), including KAL1 (300836), FGF8 (600483), and FGFR1 (136350). The
findings were consistent with a model in which KAL1 acts as a modulatory
coligand with FGF to activate the FGF receptor in an HS-dependent
manner.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 7 probands with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism with or without anosmia
(HH15; 614880), Tornberg et al. (2011) identified 5 heterozygous
missense mutations (604846.0001-604846.0005). All of the HS6ST1 variants
affected highly conserved residues, exhibited reduced activity compared
to wildtype, and were not found in 500 controls or the SNP database.
Because clinical variability was evident both within and across families
carrying the same genetic variant, Tornberg et al. (2011) analyzed 8
additional HH-associated genes to test whether other genetic factors
were contributing to the observed variability, and identified
heterozygous variants in the FGFR1 gene (136350.0025) and in the NELF
gene (608137.0001) in 2 of the HH families, respectively. The authors
concluded that the identified HS6ST1 missense mutations might not be
sufficient to cause disease, and suggested that HS6ST1 represents an
important gene contributing pathogenic alleles to the genetic network
responsible for the neuroendocrine control of human reproduction.

In the HH family in which Tornberg et al. (2011) had identified
mutations in both the HS6ST1 (604846.0002) and FGFR1 (136350.0025)
genes, Miraoui et al. (2013) analyzed 7 genes involved in the FGF8
(600483)-FGFR1 (136350) network and identified additional mutations in 2
more genes, FGF17 (603725.0001) and FLRT3 (604808.0001 and 604808.0002).
Miraoui et al. (2013) concluded that mutations in genes encoding
components of the FGF pathway are associated with complex modes of
congenital HH (CHH) inheritance and act primarily as contributors to an
oligogenic genetic architecture underlying CHH.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM 15 WITH OR WITHOUT ANOSMIA, SUSCEPTIBILITY
TO
HS6ST1, ARG372TRP

In 1 female and 2 male probands from 3 unrelated families with
hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH15; 614880), 1 with anosmia and 2 with
a normal sense of smell, Tornberg et al. (2011) identified
heterozygosity for a 1114C-T transition in the HS6ST1 gene, resulting in
an arg372-to-trp (R372W) substitution at a highly conserved residue. In
vitro functional analysis demonstrated a 25 to 35% reduction in
enzymatic activity with the R372W mutant compared to wildtype, and in an
in vivo assay involving C. elegans, the R372W mutant displayed a reduced
capacity to rescue a kal1 (300836)-dependent axon branching phenotype
compared to wildtype HS6ST1. The mutation was not found in the SNP
database or in 500 ethnically and age-matched controls. The female HH
proband had absent puberty whereas the 2 male probands had partial
puberty, and 1 male patient, who was anosmic, had osteoporosis, whereas
the other male patient had osteopenia. In addition, the female proband
had a brother with delayed puberty who did not carry the HS6ST1 R372W
mutation, whereas the anosmic male proband had an unaffected brother who
did carry the mutation. Analysis of 8 known HH-associated genes in these
families revealed that the anosmic male proband carried an additional
heterozygous missense mutation in the NELF gene (608137.0001); no other
mutations were identified. Tornberg et al. (2011) concluded that
mutations in HS6ST1 might not be sufficient to cause disease, but rather
contribute to HH via oligogenic interactions with other genes in the
genetic network responsible for neuroendocrine control of human
reproduction.

.0002
HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM 15 WITH ANOSMIA, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
HS6ST1, ARG296TRP

In a 55-year-old woman with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism with anosmia
(HH15; 614880) from a large French Canadian pedigree with several
consanguineous loops, previously reported by White et al. (1983) and in
which affected individuals displayed variable phenotypes, Tornberg et
al. (2011) identified homozygosity for an 886C-T transition in the
HS6ST1 gene, resulting in an arg296-to-trp (R296W) substitution at a
highly conserved residue. In vitro functional analysis demonstrated an
approximately 50% reduction in enzymatic activity with the R296W mutant
compared to wildtype, and in an in vivo assay involving C. elegans, the
R296W mutant displayed a reduced capacity to rescue a kal1
(300836)-dependent axon branching phenotype compared to wildtype HS6ST1.
The mutation was not found in the SNP database or in 500 ethnically and
age-matched controls. Additional features in the proband included
bilateral genu valgus and osteoporosis with multiple vertebral and
tibial fractures. The proband's brother, who also had anosmic HH, was
heterozygous for the R296W mutation, as was their unaffected father and
3 other family members, including 1 with anosmic HH, 1 with anosmic HH
and cleft palate, and 1 unaffected individual. Other phenotypes among
untested family members included normosmic HH in 1 individual and
isolated cleft palate in 3. Analysis of 8 known HH-associated genes
revealed that the proband, her brother, and their unaffected father all
carried an additional heterozygous missense mutation in the FGFR1 gene
(R250Q; 136350.0025), as did 2 other family members, 1 with anosmic HH
and 1 with anosmic HH and cleft palate. The FGFR1 mutation was also
found in heterozygosity in an unaffected family member who did not carry
the R296W HS6ST1 mutation. No mutations were identified in the other
HH-associated genes. Tornberg et al. (2011) concluded that mutations in
HS6ST1 might not be sufficient to cause disease, but rather contribute
to HH via oligogenic interactions with other genes in the genetic
network responsible for neuroendocrine control of human reproduction.

In the French Canadian pedigree in which Tornberg et al. (2011) had
identified mutations in both the FGFR1 and HS6ST1 genes, Miraoui et al.
(2013) identified additional mutations in 2 FGF-network genes, FGF17
(I108T; 603725.0001) and FLRT3 (E97G, 604808.0001 and S144I,
604808.0002).

.0003
HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM 15 WITH ANOSMIA, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
HS6ST1, ARG296GLN

In a 10.5-year-old boy with anosmic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH15;
614880), born of consanguineous parents, Tornberg et al. (2011)
identified heterozygosity for an 887G-A transition in the HS6ST1 gene,
resulting in an arg296-to-gln (R296Q) substitution at a highly conserved
residue. In vitro functional analysis demonstrated an approximately 15
to 30% reduction in enzymatic activity with the R296Q mutant compared to
wildtype, and in an in vivo assay involving C. elegans, the R296Q mutant
displayed a reduced capacity to rescue a kal1 (300836)-dependent axon
branching phenotype compared to wildtype HS6ST1. The mutation was not
found in the SNP database or in 500 ethnically and age-matched controls.
MRI at 11 months of age revealed a normal hypothalamic area and small
pituitary, although the olfactory bulbs and nerves could not be
assessed. The proband's mother, who had only delayed puberty and a
normal sense of smell, was also heterozygous for the mutation. Tornberg
et al. (2011) proposed that mutations in HS6ST1 contribute to HH via
oligogenic interactions with other genes in the genetic network
responsible for neuroendocrine control of human reproduction.

.0004
HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM 15 WITH ANOSMIA, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
HS6ST1, ARG313GLN

In a 30-year-old man who was born with anosmic hypogonadotropic
hypogonadism (HH15; 614880), cleft palate, and bilateral genu valgus,
Tornberg et al. (2011) identified heterozygosity for a 938G-A transition
in the HS6ST1 gene, resulting in an arg313-to-gln (R313Q) substitution
at a highly conserved residue. In vitro functional analysis demonstrated
an approximately 30% reduction in enzymatic activity with the R313Q
mutant compared to wildtype when HS was the acceptor substrate, whereas
mutant activity was similar to wildtype when completely desulfated
re-N-sulfated heparin was used as the substrate. In an in vivo assay
involving C. elegans, the R313Q mutant displayed a reduced capacity to
rescue a kal1 (300836)-dependent axon branching phenotype compared to
wildtype HS6ST1. The mutation was not found in the SNP database or in
500 ethnically and age-matched controls. MRI in the proband showed
absent olfactory bulbs and a normal pituitary. The proband's father, who
had only delayed puberty, and an asymptomatic, fertile sister were both
also heterozygous for the mutation, whereas another sister with anosmia
did not carry the mutation. In addition, the paternal grandmother had
delayed puberty, and the paternal grandfather was anosmic. Tornberg et
al. (2011) proposed that mutations in HS6ST1 contribute to HH via
oligogenic interactions with other genes in the genetic network
responsible for human reproduction.

.0005
HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM 15 WITH ANOSMIA, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
HS6ST1, MET394VAL

In a 36-year-old man who had anosmic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism
(HH15; 614880), Tornberg et al. (2011) identified heterozygosity for a
1180A-G transition in the HS6ST1 gene, resulting in a met394-to-val
(M394V) substitution at a highly conserved residue. In vitro functional
analysis demonstrated a 30 to 70% reduction in enzymatic activity with
the M394V mutant compared to wildtype, and in an in vivo assay involving
C. elegans, the M394V mutant displayed a reduced capacity to rescue a
kal1 (300836)-dependent axon branching phenotype compared to wildtype
HS6ST1. The mutation was not found in the SNP database or in 500
ethnically and age-matched controls. At 21 years of age, the proband
presented for failure to undergo puberty. He was overweight and
eunuchoidal, with Tanner II pubic hair and small testes, and had severe
bilateral genu valgus. While the patient was on replacement testosterone
therapy, his wife conceived. Later, he was found to have a normal adult
serum testosterone level and normal sperm count after having
discontinued his replacement therapy, indicating reversal of his
GnRH-deficiency HH. Fourteen years later, repeat neuroendocrine
evaluation confirmed a sustained reversal of his GnRH deficiency; MRI
scan showed absent olfactory bulbs and a small pituitary gland.

;;CHROMOSOME 22 OPEN READING FRAME 1; C22ORF1;;
ADULT BRAIN PROTEIN 239; 239AB
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Schwartz and Ota (1997) described a cDNA sequence and expression profile
of a gene, designated 239AB by them, that was isolated from adult brain
library and shares 79% identity with 239FB (600911) isolated from fetal
brain. The deduced amino acid sequence of 239AB was 302 amino acids long
and contained 8 additional amino acids at its N terminus compared to
239FB. Northern blot analysis detected a 4.4-kb transcript in all adult
human tissues analyzed that was most prominent in pancreas, liver,
skeletal muscle, heart, and testis. An intensely hybridizing 3.6-kb
message was detected only in brain, and was the most abundant transcript
in this tissue. Both genes are highly conserved from C. elegans to birds
and mammals. Schwartz and Ota (1997) concluded that the 239FB and 239AB
genes belong to an ancient family of genes. Phylogenetic analysis
suggested that 239FB and 239AB have origins dating back to a time before
the emergence of modern animals.

MAPPING

Schwartz and Ota (1997) mapped the MPPED1 gene to chromosome 22 by PCR
analysis of monochromosomal human/rodent somatic cell hybrids.

612027	TITLE *612027 GRP1-ASSOCIATED SCAFFOLD PROTEIN; GRASP
;;TAMALIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Nevrivy et al. (2000) cloned mouse Grasp. The deduced 392-amino acid
protein has an alanine/proline-rich N-terminal region containing an Src
(190090) homology-3 domain-binding site (PxxP), followed by a PDZ domain
and a leucine-rich domain. It shares substantial similarity with
proteins of the MAGUK family (see 606959) and with RGS12 (602512).
RT-PCR detected high expression in mouse brain, moderate expression in
lung and heart, and low expression in kidney, ovary, and embryo.
Epitope-tagged Grasp localized to the plasma membrane of transfected
human embryonic kidney cells.

By searching databases, Kitano et al. (2003) identified orthologs of rat
Grasp, which they called tamalin, in several species, including human.
Human tamalin contains 395 amino acids.

GENE FUNCTION

Using subtractive hybridization, Nevrivy et al. (2000) found that
all-trans retinoic acid upregulated expression of Grasp in a mouse
embryo cell line. Yeast 2-hybrid screening and in vitro pull-down assays
showed that the leucine-rich region of Grasp interacted with the
N-terminal coiled-coil domain of Grp1 (PSCD3; 605081). Grasp also
interacted with the N-terminal coiled-coil domain of cytohesin-2 (PSCD2;
602488) in pull-down assays. In transfected HEK293 cells, Grasp enhanced
Grp1 association with the plasma membrane and also colocalized with
endogenous ADP-ribosylation factors (see ARF1, 103180) at the plasma
membrane. Mutation analysis showed the alanine/proline-rich region
and/or the PDZ domain of Grasp directed membrane localization.

Kitano et al. (2003) showed that rat tamalin interacted with multiple
neuronal proteins through its protein-binding domains. The PDZ domain of
tamalin bound to the PDZ-binding motifs of Sap90/Psd95-associated
protein (DLGAP3; 611413) and tamalin itself, whereas the PDZ-binding
motif of tamalin interacted with the PDZ domain of Sscam (MAGI2;
606382). Tamalin formed a complex with Psd95 (DLG4; 602887) and Mint2
(APBA2; 602712) by mechanisms other than PDZ-mediated interactions.
Tamalin assembled with these proteins in vivo, and the tamalin protein
complex was verified by coimmunoprecipitation of rat brain lysates.
Kitano et al. (2003) concluded that tamalin forms a protein complex with
multiple postsynaptic and protein-trafficking scaffold proteins.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the GRASP
gene to chromosome 12 (TMAP STS-AA024848).

ANIMAL MODEL

Ogawa et al. (2007) obtained tamalin-knockout mice in the expected
mendelian ratio, and these mice were viable and fertile with normal
physical, behavioral, and emotional characteristics. However, tamalin
deficiency reduced both acute and adaptive responses to morphine and
cocaine.

611905	TITLE *611905 FIBRONECTIN TYPE III DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 4; FNDC4
;;FRCP1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Teufel et al. (2002) cloned the genomic region for a predicted
fibronectin type III repeat-containing protein, Fndc4, from a mouse BAC
clone. The putative 219-amino acid protein contains an N-terminal signal
peptide, a fibronectin type III domain, and a transmembrane domain. By
database analysis, they identified human FNDC4, which encodes a protein
that shares over 95% homology with the mouse protein. They also
identified a second mouse gene, Fndc5 (611906), that shares 60% identity
in the FNIII domain and 86% identity in the transmembrane domain with
mouse Fndc4. They found no homologs in invertebrates. Northern blot
analysis of multiple mouse tissues detected 2 Fndc4 transcripts of
approximately 2 and 3 kb, with highest expression in adult brain and
liver, and low expression in heart, lung, kidney, and testis. The
transcripts were expressed at similar levels in most tissues except
liver, where the 2-kb transcript was expressed much more strongly.
Northern blot analysis of mouse embryonic mRNA revealed strongest
expression of Fndc4 at embryonic day 11 and decreasing expression at
E17. In situ hybridization demonstrated expression of Fndc4 in the fore-
and midbrain, and extending into the hindbrain. Overexpression of a
GFP-Fndc4 fusion protein in COS cells showed localization predominantly
in the endoplasmic reticulum, with small amounts in the plasma membrane.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the FNDC4
gene to chromosome 2 (TMAP RH102212). Teufel et al. (2002) mapped the
mouse Fndc4 gene to chromosome 5.

613620	TITLE *613620 TBC1 DOMAIN FAMILY, MEMBER 10B; TBC1D10B
;;RAB27AGAP-BETA
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Small G proteins of the RAB family (see 179508) function in
intracellular vesicle trafficking by switching from the GTP-bound state
to the GDP-bound state with the assistance of guanine nucleotide
exchange factors (GEFs; see 609700) and GTPase-activating proteins
(GAPs). TBC1D10B functions as a GAP for several proteins of the Rab
family (Ishibashi et al., 2009).

CLONING

By database analysis, Itoh and Fukuda (2006) determined that the deduced
533-amino acid TBC1D10B protein, which they called RAB27AGAP-beta,
contains a central TRE2 (USP6; 604334)/yeast Bub2/CDC16 (603461) (TBC)
domain and a C-terminal DAYF motif. The TBC domain is predicted to
function as a RabGAP, and the DAYF motif is predicted to interact with
PDZ domains. TBC1D10B shares highest sequence similarity with EPI64
(TBC1D10A; 610020). The TBC domains of TBC1D10B and TBC1D10A are 81%
identical, and both contain a highly conserved catalytic arginine.
Fluorescence-tagged TBC1D10B localized to the plasma membrane of
transfected mouse melanoma cells.

Ishibashi et al. (2009) found that fluorescence-tagged TBC1D10B
localized near the plasma membrane of differentiated rat PC12
pheochromocytoma cells.

GENE FUNCTION

By screening human and mouse cDNAs encoding putative RabGAPs for the
ability to catalyze GTP exchange in Rab proteins, Itoh and Fukuda (2006)
found that both TBC1D10A and TBC1D10B functioned as GAPs for mouse
Rab27a (603868) and induced melanosome aggregation in a mouse melanocyte
cell line. Both TBC1D10A and TBC1D10B increased the GTPase activity of
Rab27a and reduced the amount of GTP-Rab27a when coexpressed with
Rab27a.

Endogenous Rab3a (179490) is present on dense-core vesicles in the
distal portion of neurites in differentiated rat PC12 cells. By
overexpressing TBC1D10B in PC12 cells, Ishibashi et al. (2009) found
that TBC1D10B functioned as a GAP for Rab3a, reducing association of
Rab3a with neurites. Mutation of the catalytic arg134 in the TBC domain
of TBC1D10B completely inhibited its GAP activity against Rab3a in PC12
and transfected COS-7 cells. TBC1D10B also showed significant GAP
activity toward Rab22a (612966), Rab27a, and Rab35 (604199), but not
Rab2a (RAB2; 179509) or Rab6a (179513).

MAPPING

Hartz (2010) mapped the TBC1D10B gene to chromosome 16p11.2 based on an
alignment of the TBC1D10B sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC063112) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

;;NUCLEAR HORMONE RECEPTOR TR4 TESTICULAR NUCLEAR RECEPTOR 4; TR4;;
TAK1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the nuclear hormone receptor family, such as NR2C2, act as
ligand-activated transcription factors. The proteins have an N-terminal
transactivation domain, a central DNA-binding domain with 2 zinc
fingers, and a ligand-binding domain at the C terminus. The activated
receptor/ligand complex is translocated to the nucleus where it binds to
hormone response elements of target genes (Yoshikawa et al., 1996).

CLONING

Chang et al. (1994) cloned NR2C2, or TR4, a member of the nuclear
hormone receptor superfamily, using degenerate PCR on RNA from the
supraoptic nucleus of the brain with primers based on the conserved
DNA-binding domain of these genes. They isolated TR4 cDNAs from both
human and rat libraries. The cDNAs encode a predicted 615-amino acid
human protein and a 596-amino acid rat protein that are 98% identical.
The TR4 sequence is similar to that of the TR2 orphan receptor (Chang et
al., 1994). Together they appear to form a distinct subfamily.

Hirose et al. (1994) cloned the TR4 gene, which they designated TAK1,
from a human lymphoblastoma cDNA library. They stated that the predicted
protein is 596 amino acids long. On SDS-PAGE, TR4 migrated as a 65-kD
protein. Using Northern blot analysis, Hirose et al. (1994) found that
TR4 is expressed as a 9.4-kb mRNA in many tissues, and as a 2.8-kb mRNA
primarily in testis. The 2 transcripts appeared to differ in the length
of the 3-prime untranslated region. In mouse and rat testis, TR4 was
expressed most abundantly in spermatocytes.

Yoshikawa et al. (1996) used RT-PCR to show that in rat and human, 2
isoforms (with and without a 19 codon exon) could be detected; in human,
they were both expressed widely in tissues including brain, placenta,
and ovary. However, in the PA1 human ovarian cancer cell line only the
short form was detected. The difference in cDNA length is a consequence
of alternative splicing.

GENE FUNCTION

Nakajima et al. (2004) stated that TAK1 binds as a homodimer to direct
repeats of the consensus sequence AGGTCA. They identified TIP27 (JAZF1;
606246) as a repressor of TAK1 transcriptional activity. Yeast and
mammalian 2-hybrid analyses revealed that TIP27 interacted with TAK1,
but not with other nuclear receptors, either in the presence or absence
of their respective ligands. Protein pull-down and immunoprecipitation
analyses confirmed the interaction between TAK1 and TIP27. Deletion
analysis revealed that an N-terminal domain of TIP27 interacted with a
portion of the ligand-binding domain of TAK1. Reporter gene assays
showed that TIP27 repressed TIP1 transcriptional activity in a
dose-dependent manner. TIP27 did not interfere with TIP1
homodimerization or with binding of TIP1 to DNA, suggesting that
interaction of TIP27 with TAK1 may inhibit recruitment of a coactivator.

MAPPING

Yoshikawa et al. (1996) mapped the human NR2C2 gene to chromosome 3
using a somatic cell hybrid panel and refined the localization to 3p25
by fluorescence in situ hybridization.

ANIMAL MODEL

Collins et al. (2004) found that Nr2c2-null mice were born at lower than
mendelian ratios, with a significantly lower proportion of female than
male knockout mice. A growth defect was apparent early in postnatal life
in affected mice, and their fertility was greatly reduced. Additionally,
female mice lacking Nr2c2 exhibited behavioral abnormalities, including
defects in maternal behavior.

Independently, Mu et al. (2004) found that Tr4 -/- mice were smaller
than wildtype. Tr4 -/- mice exhibited varying degrees of behavioral
defects, such as hypersensitivity to environmental stimuli. Male
fertility was reduced in Tr4 -/- mice and was associated with delayed
spermatogenesis and decreased sperm production.

Chen et al. (2005) reported that behavioral abnormalities in Tr4 -/-
mice included mild trembling, unsteady gait, hyperreactivity upon
manipulation, hind limb grasping, decreased tendency to explore
surroundings, and impaired motor coordination and balance. Histologic
examination of postnatal Tr4 -/- cerebellum revealed gross abnormalities
in foliation, with loss of lobule VII in the anterior vermis.
Laminations of Tr4 -/- cerebellar cortex were abnormal, and Purkinje
cells showed aberrant dendritic arborization and loss of calbindin (see
CALB1, 114050) staining. Developing Tr4 -/- cerebellum exhibited reduced
expression of genes involved in cerebellar morphologic development.

;;S6K1;;
p70 S6 KINASE, ALPHA;;
p70(S6K)-ALPHA;;
p70-ALPHA
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

RPS6KB1 mediates the rapid phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6
(180460) on multiple serine residues in response to insulin or several
classes of mitogens (Grove et al., 1991).

CLONING

By screening fibroblast and hepatoma cell line cDNA libraries using a
rat Rps6kb1 probe, Grove et al. (1991) cloned 2 splice variants of human
RPS6KB1, which they designated alpha-I and alpha-II. The deduced
proteins contain 525 and 502 amino acids, respectively, and are
identical except for the 23 additional N-terminal residues present in
alpha-I. Exogenous expression of alpha-I cDNA in COS-7 cells resulted in
closely-spaced ladders of polypeptides between 65 and 70 kD and between
85 and 90 kD, whereas expression of the alpha-II cDNA resulted in
peptides between 65 and 70 kD only. Grove et al. (1991) determined that
alpha-I produced both polypeptide clusters by utilizing 2 initiator
methionine codons, the second of which is present in the alpha-II
transcript. The laddering within the 2 clusters was caused
posttranslational modification of the kinase polypeptide by
phosphorylation at multiple sites.

Gout et al. (1998) described the domain organization of the p70 alpha-1
protein, which includes an N-terminal noncatalytic region, a catalytic
domain, a kinase extension domain, an autoinhibitory domain, and a
C-terminal tail. The p70 alpha-1 protein shares 70% amino acid identity
with the p70 beta protein (RPS6KB2; 608939), and 7 serine or threonine
phosphorylation sites are completely conserved. Northern blot analysis
detected 3.4- and 7.4-kb transcripts in all tissues examined.

GENE FUNCTION

Grove et al. (1991) found that transient expression of p70 S6K alpha-I
and alpha-II in COS-7 cells resulted in a 2.5- to 4.0-fold increase in
overall S6 kinase activity. Immunoblot analysis detected alpha-I and
alpha-II as closely spaced ladders of polypeptides between 85 and 90 kD
and between 65 and 70 kD, respectively. Only the alpha-I and alpha-II
proteins of slowest mobility were associated with S6 kinase activity.
The slower mobility and higher enzymatic activity of the rat p70 S6K
proteins were due to serine/threonine phosphorylation, since
phosphatase-2A inactivated the kinase activity and increased the
mobility of the bands on polyacrylamide gels. Grove et al. (1991)
concluded that acquisition of S6 protein kinase catalytic function is
restricted to the most extensively phosphorylated polypeptides.

Gout et al. (1998) examined the catalytic activity of p70 alpha-1
transiently expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing
human insulin receptor (147670). S6 kinase activity was stimulated by
insulin, serum, phorbol ester, and PDGF (see 190040). In transfected
human embryonic kidney cells, serum-activated kinase activity was
potently inhibited by rapamycin and wortmannin in a dose-dependent
manner, suggesting that MTOR (601231) and PI3 kinase (see 602925) are
involved in p70 alpha-1 activation.

Saitoh et al. (1998) characterized p70 S6K-alpha expressed by human
embryonic kidney cells. A 32-mer S6 peptide was phosphorylated by the
wildtype kinase, but not by a catalytically inactivated lys100-to-arg
mutant kinase.

In mammals, MTOR cooperates with PI3K-dependent effectors in a
biochemical signaling pathway to regulate the size of proliferating
cells. Fingar et al. (2002) presented evidence that rat S6k1 alpha-II,
Eif4e (133440), and Eif4ebp1 (602223) mediate Mtor-dependent cell size
control.

Holz et al. (2005) showed that MTOR and S6K1 maneuvered on and off the
EIF3 (see 602039) translation initiation complex in HEK293 cells in a
signal-dependent, choreographed fashion. When inactive, S6K1 associated
with the EIF3 complex, while the S6K1 activator MTOR, in association
with its binding partner RAPTOR (607130), did not. Hormone- or
mitogen-mediated cell stimulation promoted MTOR/RAPTOR binding to the
EIF3 complex and phosphorylation of S6K1. Phosphorylation resulted in
S6K1 dissociation and activation, followed by phosphorylation of S6K1
targets, including EIF4B (603928), which, upon phosphorylation, was
recruited into the EIF3 complex. Holz et al. (2005) concluded that the
EIF3 preinitiation complex acts as a scaffold to coordinate responses to
stimuli that promote efficient protein synthesis.

Dorrello et al. (2006) found that the tumor suppressor programmed cell
death protein-4 (PDCD4; 608610) inhibits the translation initiation
factor EIF4A (see 602641), an RNA helicase that catalyzes the unwinding
of secondary structure at the 5-prime untranslated region of mRNAs. In
response to mitogens, PDCD4 was rapidly phosphorylated on ser67 by the
protein kinase S6K1 and subsequently degraded via the ubiquitin ligase
SCF-beta(TRCP) (603482). Expression in cultured cells of a stable PDCD4
mutant that was unable to bind beta-TRCP inhibited translation of an
mRNA with a structured 5-prime untranslated region, resulted in smaller
cell size, and slowed down cell cycle progression. Dorrello et al.
(2006) proposed that regulated degradation of PDCD4 in response to
mitogens allows efficient protein synthesis and consequently cell
growth.

Robitaille et al. (2013) found that mTORC1 indirectly phosphorylates the
trifunctional protein CAD (carbamoyl phosphate synthetase-2/aspartate
transcarbamoylase/ dihydroorotase; 114010), which catalyzes the first 3
steps in de novo pyrimidine synthesis, on residue S1859 through S6K.
CAD-S1859 phosphorylation promoted CAD oligomerization and thereby
stimulated de novo synthesis of pyrimidines and progression through S
phase of the cell cycle in mammalian cells. Ben-Sahra et al. (2013)
independently showed that activation of mTORC1 led to the acute
stimulation of metabolic flux through the de novo pyrimidine synthesis
pathway. mTORC1 signaling posttranslationally regulated this metabolic
pathway via its downstream target S6K1, which directly phosphorylates
S1859 on CAD. Growth signaling through mTORC1 thus stimulates the
production of new nucleotides to accommodate an increase in RNA and DNA
synthesis needed for ribosome biogenesis and anabolic growth.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the RPS6KB1
gene to chromosome 17 (TMAP SHGC-34099).

ANIMAL MODEL

Shima et al. (1998) generated mice deficient in S6k1 by targeted
disruption. These mice were viable and fertile, but exhibited a
conspicuous reduction in body size during embryogenesis, an effect that
was mostly overcome by adulthood. Shima et al. (1998) hypothesized that
the weak penetrance of the phenotype may arise from increased expression
in S6k1-deficient mice of the highly homologous gene S6k2.

Pende et al. (2000) showed that mice deficient for S6k1, a known
effector of the phosphatidylinositide-3-OH kinase signaling pathway,
were hypoinsulinemic and glucose intolerant. Whereas insulin resistance
was not observed in isolated muscle, such mice exhibited a sharp
reduction in glucose-induced insulin secretion and in pancreatic insulin
content. This was not due to a lesion in glucose sensing or insulin
production, but to a reduction in pancreatic endocrine mass, which was
accounted for by a selective decrease in beta-cell size. Pende et al.
(2000) concluded that the observed phenotype closely parallels those of
preclinical type II diabetes mellitus, in which malnutrition-induced
hypoinsulinemia predisposes individuals to glucose intolerance.

Pende et al. (2004) found that mice deficient in S6k1 or S6k2 were born
at expected mendelian ratios. Compared with wildtype mice, S6k1 -/- mice
were significantly smaller, and S6k2 -/- mice tended to be slightly
larger. Mice lacking both genes showed a sharp reduction in viability
due to perinatal lethality. Analysis of S6 phosphorylation in the
cytoplasm and nucleoli of cells derived from each S6k genotype suggested
that both kinases are required for full S6 phosphorylation, but that
S6k2 may contribute more to the response. Despite the impairment of S6
phosphorylation in cells from double-knockout mice, cell cycle
progression and translation of 5-prime terminal oligopyrimidine mRNAs
were still modulated by mitogens in a rapamycin-dependent manner.
Double-knockout cells also showed persistence of S6 phosphorylation on
the first 2 serines phosphorylated in response to mitogens, and this
step was catalyzed by a MAPK-dependent kinase. Pende et al. (2004)
concluded that a redundancy exists between the S6K and MAPK pathways in
mediating early S6 phosphorylation in response to mitogens.

Um et al. (2004) reported that S6k1-deficient mice are protected against
obesity due to enhanced beta-oxidation; however, on a high-fat diet,
levels of glucose and free fatty acids still rose in S6k1-deficient
mice, resulting in insulin receptor desensitization. Nevertheless,
S6k1-deficient mice remained sensitive to insulin due to the apparent
loss of a negative feedback loop from S6k1 to insulin receptor
substrate-1 (IRS1; 147545), which blunts phosphorylation of serines at
positions 307, 636, and 639, all sites involved in insulin resistance.
Moreover, wildtype mice on a high-fat diet as well as K/K A(y) and ob/ob
mice had markedly elevated S6k1 activity and, unlike S6k1-deficient
mice, increased phosphorylation of Irs1 serines at positions 307, 636,
and 639. Um et al. (2004) concluded that under conditions of nutrient
satiation, S6K1 negatively regulates insulin signaling.

Selman et al. (2009) demonstrated in mice that deletion of S6K1, a
component of the nutrient-responsive mTOR signaling pathway, led to
increased life span and resistance to age-related pathologies such as
bone, immune, and motor dysfunction and loss of insulin sensitivity.
Deletion of S6K1 induced gene expression patterns similar to those seen
in caloric restriction or with pharmacologic activation of adenosine
monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a conserved
regulator of the metabolic response to caloric restriction.

600694	TITLE *600694 INTERLEUKIN 6 SIGNAL TRANSDUCER; IL6ST
;;GP130 TRANSDUCER CHAIN; GP130
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Initially described as the interleukin-6 signal transducer, gp130 is a
transducer chain shared by many cytokines, including IL6 (147620), IL11
(147681), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF; 159540), oncostatin M (OSM;
165095), and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF; 118945), as reviewed by
Kishimoto et al. (1994). All of these cytokines act via a bi- or
tripartite receptor complex in which signaling is triggered by
homodimerization (IL6) or heterodimerization with LIF-Rb/gp190 protein
(IL11, LIF, OSM, and CNTF) of gp130. These cytokines thus mediate
similar biologic activities in various tissues. See also IL6RA (147880).

CLONING

By immunoscreening a placenta cDNA expression library with antibodies to
human gp130, followed by screening a myeloma cell line cDNA library,
Hibi et al. (1990) cloned gp130. The deduced 918-amino acid protein has
an N-terminal signal peptide, followed by a 597-amino acid extracellular
region, a transmembrane domain, and a 277-amino acid cytoplasmic domain.
It also contains 14 potential N-glycosylation sites. The mature
896-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 101 kD. Part
of the extracellular region, including 4 conserved cysteines and a WSxWS
motif, shows significant homology with cytokine receptors. Gp130 is most
closely related to GCSFR (CSF3R; 138971). Both receptors contain 6
fibronectin (135600) type III modules in the extracellular region. The
intracellular domain has a consensus nucleotide-binding domain, but it
has no protein kinase catalytic domain. Four sequences in the
intracellular domain are similar to GTP-binding motifs of RAS
(190020)-related proteins. Northern blot analysis detected a 7.0-kb
transcript in all cell lines examined. Gp130 showed an apparent
molecular mass of 130 kD by SDS-PAGE.

Saito et al. (1992) cloned mouse gp130. The deduced 917-amino acid
protein has a domain structure equivalent to that of human gp130,
including 4 conserved cysteines and the 4 GTP-binding motif-like
sequences. Mouse and human gp130 share 76.8% amino acid homology,
including 100% identity in a 116-amino acid stretch that spans the
transmembrane domain. Northern blot analysis detected 7.0- and 10.0-kb
transcripts expressed in varying ratios in all tissues examined. Lowest
expression was in spleen. During mouse embryonic development, robust
expression of both gp130 transcripts was detected on day 6, and
expression peaked on day 8.

Narazaki et al. (1993) purified 2 soluble forms of gp130 (sgp130) from
human serum. These proteins had apparent molecular masses of 90 and 110
kD.

Diamant et al. (1997) cloned sgp130 from a peripheral blood mononuclear
cell cDNA library. The deduced protein contains 624 amino acids. Diamant
et al. (1997) determined that the sgp130 transcript results from
alternative splicing and includes an 85-bp exon just before the
transmembrane-coding exon. This insertion results in a frameshift, and
the sequence following the insertion encodes 4 amino acids not found in
full-length membrane-bound gp130, followed by a stop codon 1 bp from the
transmembrane-coding region. PCR analysis detected expression of sgp130
in all myeloma cell lines tested except 1 line growing independent of
IL6 stimulation. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells transfected with
sgp130 secreted the protein into the medium. Some sgp130 was also
secreted by CHO cells transfected with cDNA encoding full-length gp130,
but at a much lower concentration. Diamant et al. (1997) concluded that
sgp130 could be generated both by shedding and by expressing an
alternatively spliced transcript.

GENE FUNCTION

Hibi et al. (1990) determined that cells transfected with IL6RA
expressed mainly low-affinity IL6-binding sites. Cotransfection of gp130
cDNA increased the number of high-affinity binding sites, but gp130 did
not directly bind IL6 or several other cytokines. Mouse IL3
(147740)-dependent pre-B cells proliferated when cultured with IL6 plus
soluble IL6RA only following transfection with human gp130. Hibi et al.
(1990) concluded that gp130 is involved in the formation of
high-affinity IL6-binding sites and in IL6 signal transduction.

Murakami et al. (1991) analyzed C-terminal truncation mutants of gp130.
Mutants retaining only the last 10 amino acids of the 277-amino acid
C-terminal region proximal to the transmembrane domain were capable of
binding the IL6/IL6R complex; however, these mutants were unable to
transduce the growth signal following IL6/IL6R complex binding. Signal
transduction required a 61-amino acid region containing 2 short segments
that share homology with other cytokine receptor family members. Gp130
molecules with mutations in either of these segments could not transduce
a growth signal. Loss of signal-transducing ability coincided with loss
of IL6-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of gp130.

Saito et al. (1992) determined that administration of IL6 in mice caused
upregulation of gp130 mRNA in several tissues. In liver, both gp130 and
Il6ra mRNA were upregulated by IL6.

Narazaki et al. (1993) determined that sgp130 within human serum or
exogenous recombinant sgp130 inhibited growth of transfected mouse pre-B
cells induced by the IL6/IL6R complex. Recombinant sgp130 also inhibited
growth in erythroleukemia cells stimulated by OSM or the CNTF/CNTFR
(118946) complex in a dose-dependent manner. Recombinant sgp130 was less
inhibitory to growth induced by LIF or the IL6/IL6R complex. Narazaki et
al. (1993) concluded that sgp130 has a role in modulating signals
transduced by membrane-bound gp130.

Chow et al. (2001) noted that cytokines that activate gp130 share a
common 4-helix bundle fold and that gp130 recognition of ligands occurs
through its cytokine-binding homology region, located at domains 2 and
3. In addition, activation occurs through a separate N-terminal, Ig-like
domain (domain 1). Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV, or
HHV-8) encodes a functional homolog of IL6 (termed vIL6; 25% sequence
homology) that is expressed in KSHV-infected cells and is able to induce
angiogenesis and hematopoiesis in IL6-dependent cell lines. In contrast
to IL6, which binds to gp130 only after it forms a complex with IL6RA,
vIL6 directly activates gp130. By crystal structure analysis, Chow et
al. (2001) demonstrated that in the extracellular signaling assembly
between vIL6 and gp130, 2 complexes are cross-linked into a tetramer
through direct interactions between the Ig domain of gp130 and site III
of vIL6, which is necessary for gp130 activation. Unlike IL6, vIL6 uses
mainly hydrophobic residues to contact gp130, enhancing the
complementarity of the vIL6-gp130 binding interfaces. Identical
positions of 2 disulfide bonds in IL6 and vIL6 and the high conservation
of the hydrophobic core residues account for the reproduction of the
helical scaffold by vIL6, enabling gp130 contact.

Pflanz et al. (2004) found that transfection of WSX1 (605350) into a
cell line expressing gp130 but only low levels of WSX1 resulted in IL27
(see 605816)-dependent phosphorylation of STAT1 (600555) and STAT3
(102582). In addition, they showed that anti-gp130 blocked IL27-mediated
cellular effects. Quantitative PCR analysis indicated that, in addition
to naive CD4 (186940)-positive T cells, numerous cell types expressed
both gp130 and WSX1, including mast cells. IL27 stimulation of mast
cells resulted in upregulation of proinflammatory cytokine expression.
Pflanz et al. (2004) concluded that IL27 not only contributes to the
development of an adaptive immune response through its action on
CD4-positive T cells, but also directly acts on cells of the innate
immune system.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

IL6 is an immunoregulatory cytokine that activates a cell-surface
signaling assembly composed of IL6, IL6RA, and the shared signaling
receptor gp130. Boulanger et al. (2003) solved the crystal structure of
the extracellular signaling complex to 3.65-angstrom resolution, which
revealed a hexameric, interlocking assembly mediated by a total of 10
symmetry-related, thermodynamically coupled interfaces. Assembly of the
hexameric complex occurs sequentially: IL6 is first engaged by
IL6R-alpha and then presented to gp130 in the proper geometry to
facilitate a cooperative transition into the high affinity,
signaling-competent hexamer. The quaternary structures of other IL6/IL12
family signaling complexes are likely constructed by means of a similar
topologic blueprint.

GENE STRUCTURE

Szalai et al. (2000) determined that the IL6ST gene contains 17 exons
and spans about 51 kb.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Rodriguez et al. (1995) assigned
the functional IL6ST gene to chromosome 5q11 and its nontranscribed
pseudogene to 17p11.

Hartz (2010) mapped the IL6ST gene to chromosome 5q11.2 based on an
alignment of the IL6ST sequence (GenBank GENBANK AB015706) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

- Pseudogenes

Kidd et al. (1992) concluded that there are 2 functional genes for
IL6ST. Rodriguez et al. (1995) showed, however, that the 2 localizations
correspond to a pseudogene (on chromosome 17) and the functional gene on
chromosome 5.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Rebouissou et al. (2009) demonstrated a marked activation of the IL6
(147620) signaling pathway in inflammatory hepatocellular adenomas.
Sequencing candidate genes pinpointed the response to somatic
gain-of-function mutations in the IL6ST gene, which encodes the
signaling coreceptor gp130. Rebouissou et al. (2009) found that 60% of
inflammatory hepatocellular adenomas harbor small in-frame deletions
that target the binding sites of gp130 for IL6, and expression of 4
different gp130 mutants in hepatocellular cells activated STAT3 (102582)
in the absence of ligand. Furthermore, analysis of hepatocellular
carcinomas revealed that rare gp130 alterations are always accompanied
by beta-catenin (116806)-activating mutations, suggesting a cooperative
effect of these signaling pathways in the malignant conversion of
hepatocytes. The recurrent gain-of-function gp130 mutations in these
human hepatocellular adenomas fully explains activation of the acute
inflammatory phase observed in tumorous hepatocytes, and suggests that
similar alterations may occur in other inflammatory epithelial tumors
with STAT activation.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using Cre-loxP-mediated recombination to generate mice harboring a
ventricular-restricted knockout of the gp130 cytokine receptor, Hirota
et al. (1999) demonstrated a critical role for a gp130-dependent myocyte
survival pathway in the transition to heart failure. Such conditional
mutant mice have normal cardiac structure and function, but during
aortic pressure overload, these mice displayed rapid onset of dilated
cardiomyopathy and massive induction of myocyte apoptosis compared with
the control mice, which exhibited compensatory hypertrophy. Thus,
cardiac myocyte apoptosis is a critical point in the transition between
compensatory cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. Hirota et al. (1999)
suggested that gp130-dependent cytokines may represent a novel
therapeutic strategy for preventing in vivo heart failure.

Tebbutt et al. (2002) noted that gp130 contains at least 2
cell-signaling modules. One encompasses 4 phosphotyrosine-binding sites
for the SH2 domains of STAT1 and STAT3, whereas the other includes a
phosphotyrosine that activates SHP2 (176876) upstream of the RAS
(190020)-ERK (see 601795) pathway. Tebbutt et al. (2002) generated mice
carrying targeted mutations in each of these modules. Mice homozygous
for a truncated version of gp130 lacking all Stat-binding sites
spontaneously developed intestinal ulceration at sites associated with
repeated mechanical trauma (gastric pylorus and rectum). Unlike wildtype
mice, those with the Stat-binding domain mutation were unable to recover
from trauma induced by ingestion of sodium dextran sulfate. Tebbutt et
al. (2002) noted that impaired wound healing occurs in Tff3
(600633)-null mice, and biochemical analysis confirmed reduced levels of
Tff3 in the mice with the Stat-binding domain mutation. Mice homozygous
for a tyr757-to-phe (Y757F) mutation, which inactivated the Shp2-binding
domain of gp130, developed normally into superficially healthy adults,
but they showed age-dependent enlargement of the stomach, proximal small
intestine, and spleen. Histologic examination revealed
hyperproliferative lesions within the antropyloric mucosa, often
circumferential, resulting in gastric outlet obstruction. Tebbutt et al.
(2002) noted that the gastric pathology was essentially phenocopied in
Tff1 (113710) null mice, and biochemical analysis of gastric Tff1 levels
in mice with the Shp2-binding domain mutation confirmed a 75% reduction
in comparison with wildtype mice; levels of Tff3 were elevated in the
mutant mice. Using a luciferase reporter assay with cells transiently
transfected with gp130 carrying the Stat- and Shp2-binding domain
mutations, Tebbutt et al. (2002) confirmed simultaneous activation of
the Stat1/Stat3 and Shp2-Ras-Erk pathways in response to IL6 activation,
resulting in enhanced luciferase activity of Tff1-luc and Tff3-luc
reporter constructs. Tebbutt et al. (2002) concluded that the
pathologies observed in the gp130 mutant mice resulted from disruption
of the normally simultaneous and coordinated activation of the
Stat1/Stat3 and Shp2-Ras-Erk signaling cascades.

Atsumi et al. (2002) generated mice with a tyr759-to-phe mutation in the
Shp2-binding site of gp130. These mice developed a rheumatoid arthritis
(RA; 180300)-like joint disease at about 1 year of age, accompanied by
autoantibody production and accumulation of memory/activated T cells and
myeloid cells. Before disease onset, T cells were hyperresponsive in
vitro. Mutant mice that were also Rag2 (179616) deficient did not
develop disease, indicating the importance of lymphocytes in this model.
Atsumi et al. (2002) concluded that point mutation in the gp130 cytokine
receptor can induce autoimmune disease.

Jenkins et al. (2005) assessed the contribution of exaggerated Stat3
activation to the phenotype of mice homozygous for Y757F, which disrupts
the negative feedback mechanism on gp130-dependent Stat signaling
(Tebbutt et al., 2002). They found that development of abnormalities
associated with gp130(Y757F) homozygosity, including reduced life span,
splenomegaly, exaggerated hepatic acute-phase response, and spontaneous
gastric adenomas while young, was attenuated when gp130(Y757F)
homozygosity was expressed on a Stat3 +/- background.

Both bone formation and resorption are altered significantly in gp130
-/- mice. Although the mutation results in neonatal lethality, reduced
trabecular bone mass, associated with an increase in osteoclastogenesis,
is a feature of the neonatal skeleton (Kawasaki et al., 1997; Shin et
al., 2004). Sims et al. (2004) found that mouse strains homozygous for
gp130 mutations in the Stat activation sites had normal trabecular bone
volume and bone turnover, but reduced bone length and premature growth
plate closure, suggesting a role for gp130-STAT1/3 signaling in
chondrocyte differentiation. In contrast, mice with mutations in the
gp130 Shp2-Ras-Mapk (see 176948) activation sites showed normal bone
size, but reduced trabecular bone volume and high bone turnover,
associated with increased osteoclastogenesis. Sims et al. (2004)
concluded that gp130 controls balanced regulation of bone growth and
mass depending on selective activation of distinct downstream signaling
pathways.

609948	TITLE *609948 RING FINGER PROTEIN 216; RNF216
;;TRIAD DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 3; TRIAD3;;
ZINC FINGER PROTEIN INHIBITING NFKB; ZIN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TRIAD proteins, such as TRIAD3, contain 2 RING fingers flanking a
conserved cysteine-rich (C6HC) zinc-binding domain called a double RING
finger-linked (DRIL) domain. Like other RING finger proteins, TRIADs
interact with a variety of proteins (van der Reijden et al., 1999).

CLONING

By yeast 2-hybrid screening of a B-cell cDNA library using RIP (RIPK1;
603453) as bait, followed by database searching and 5-prime RACE, Chen
et al. (2002) cloned TRIAD3, which they called ZIN. The predicted
488-amino acid protein contains 4 central RING-like domains (RLDs) and a
C-terminal proline-rich domain. Northern blot analysis revealed
ubiquitous expression of 3.0- and 6.0-kb transcripts, with highest
levels in peripheral blood leukocytes and testis. Western blot analysis
showed a 56-kD protein in several human cell lines. Immunofluorescence
microscopy suggested a cytoplasmic localization for ZIN, like that of
RIP.

By yeast-2 hybrid screening of a human leukocyte cDNA library using the
cytoplasmic TIR domain of TLR9 (605474) as bait, followed by database
analysis and screening a placenta cDNA library, Chuang and Ulevitch
(2004) cloned 5 splice variants of TRIAD3 that they designated TRIAD3A
to TRIAD3E. TRIAD3A and TRIAD3B encode predicted proteins of 866 and 923
amino acids, respectively. TRIAD3C, TRIAD3D, and TRIAD3E encode
identical proteins of 489 amino acids. All TRIAD3 isoforms contain a
C-terminal TRIAD domain and differ in their N-terminal halves. RT-PCR
analysis showed that TRIAD3A was the most abundant form and was
expressed widely in cell lines and tissues.

GENE STRUCTURE

Chuang and Ulevitch (2004) determined that the TRIAD3 gene contains 17
exons and spans about 160 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Chuang and Ulevitch (2004) mapped the
RNF216 gene to chromosome 7p22.

GENE FUNCTION

Using coimmunoprecipitation experiments and mutation analysis, Chen et
al. (2002) found that interaction of ZIN and RIP required the RLDs of
ZIN. Luciferase and Western blot analysis showed that ZIN inhibited
RIP-, IKKB (IKBKB; 603258)-, TNF (191160)-, and IL1 (see 147720)-induced
NFKB (see 164011) activation in an RLD-dependent manner. ZIN also
potentiated RIP-induced apoptosis. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments
showed that ZIN did not compete with TRAF2 (601895) for interaction with
RIP.

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Chuang and Ulevitch (2004) found that
TRIAD3 interacted with the cytoplasmic domains of TLR3 (603029), TLR4
(603030), TLR5 (603031), and TLR9, but not with that of TLR2 (603028).
Immunoblot analysis showed that expression of TRIAD3A with ubiquitin
(see 191339) resulted in TRIAD3A autoubiquitination and promoted
ubiquitination of TLR9 by acting through UBCH7 (UBE2L3; 603721). TRIAD3A
overexpression caused nearly complete degradation of TLR4 and TLR9
protein, but not TLR2 protein, while its effects on TLR3 and TLR5 were
smaller. The TRIAD3A-induced reduction in TLR protein expression was
paralleled by reductions in signal-specific activation for TLRs, as
shown by RT-PCR and small interfering RNA analyses. Chuang and Ulevitch
(2004) concluded that TRIAD3A is an intracellular protein that regulates
TLR expression and limits the potentially harmful effects that occur
after TLR activation.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a 7-generation consanguineous Palestinian family with cerebellar
ataxia and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (CAHH; 212840), Margolin et al.
(2013) performed exome sequencing and identified homozygosity for 2
missense mutations in 2 different genes, RNF216 (R751C; 609948.0001) and
OTUD4 (G333V; 611744.0001), that segregated with disease in the family.
Sequencing both genes in 9 more patients revealed no further mutations
in the OTUD4 gene, although 1 proband was compound heterozygous for
mutations in RNF216 (609948.0002 and 609948.0003). In addition, several
patients carried heterozygous mutations in RNF216 that were also
detected in unaffected parents and sibs. Margolin et al. (2013)
suggested that the most parsimonious explanation for the observed
patterns in these patients would be oligogenic inheritance.

ANIMAL MODEL

Margolin et al. (2013) injected splice-blocking morpholino
oligonucleotides against the zebrafish genes rnf216 or odud4 (611744)
and observed defects in the eye, optic tetum, and cerebellum.
Combinatorial suppression of both genes exacerbated these phenotypes,
which were rescued by wildtype but not mutant human RNF216 or OTUD4
messenger RNA.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CEREBELLAR ATAXIA AND HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM
RNF216, ARG751CYS

In 3 affected sibs from a 7-generation consanguineous Palestinian family
with cerebellar ataxia and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (CAHH; 212840),
originally reported by Seminara et al. (2002), Margolin et al. (2013)
identified homozygosity for 2 missense mutations in 2 genes: a c.2251C-T
transition in the RNF216 gene, resulting in an arg751-to-cys (R751C)
substitution at a highly conserved residue in the second RING domain,
and a missense mutation in the OTUD4 gene (G333V; 611744.0001). The
mutations segregated with disease in the family and neither was found in
672 Middle Eastern control chromosomes, including 36 Palestinian
chromosomes; furthermore, the RNF216 R751C mutation was not found in
13,006 chromosomes from the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, although the
OTUD4 G333V variant was detected in 2 of those chromosomes. The
phenotype of mutant zebrafish injected with splice-blocking morpholino
oligonucleotides against rnf216 could be rescued by wildtype but not
mutant RNF216 mRNA, suggesting that the R751C mutation affects protein
function. The 3 sibs had prominent cerebellar and mild cortical atrophy
with hypodensities in the cerebral white matter on CT scan, and all died
in the fifth decade of life after the development of dementia, 2 from
aspiration pneumonia and 1 from possible pulmonary embolism.
Neuropathologic examination of the brain of 1 sib revealed neuronal loss
in cerebellar pathways and the hippocampus; surviving hippocampal
neurons contained ubiquitin-immunoreactive intranuclear inclusions.

CEREBELLAR ATAXIA AND HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM
RNF216, CYS597TER

In a Caucasian man with cerebellar ataxia and hypogonadotropic
hypogonadism (212840), who developed dementia at 22 years of age and
died at age 36, Margolin et al. (2013) identified compound
heterozygosity for a c.1791T-A transversion in the RNF216 gene,
resulting in a cys597-to-ter (C597X) substitution in the first RING
finger domain, and a 2-bp deletion (c.615_616delGA; 609948.0003),
causing a frameshift predicted to result in a premature termination
codon (glu505aspfsX15). The patient's unaffected parents were each
heterozygous for 1 of the mutations, neither of which was found in
13,006 chromosomes from the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project.

130500	TITLE *130500 ERYTHROCYTE MEMBRANE PROTEIN BAND 4.1; EPB41
;;PROTEIN 4.1, RED BLOOD CELL TYPE; 4.1R;;
EL1 GENE
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Conboy et al. (1986) reported the molecular cloning and characterization
of human erythrocyte protein 4.1 cDNA and the complete amino acid
sequence of the protein. Probes prepared from the cloned erythrocyte
protein 4.1 cDNA hybridized with distinct mRNA species from a wide
variety of nonerythroid tissues, including brain, liver, placenta,
pancreas, and intestine, implying substantial homology between erythroid
and nonerythroid protein 4.1. Brain protein 4.1, also known as synapsin
I (313440), is the best characterized of the nonerythroid forms.

Tang et al. (1988) compared nucleotide sequences of mRNA encoding
erythroid and lymphoid protein 4.1 isoforms. The lymphoid protein 4.1
isoforms exhibited several nucleotide sequence motifs that appeared
either to be inserted into or deleted from the mRNA by alternative
splicing of a common mRNA precursor. One of the motifs, located within
the spectrin-actin binding domain, was found only in erythroid cells and
was specifically produced during erythroid cell maturation. Conboy et
al. (1988) demonstrated that alternative splicing accounts for multiple
isoforms of protein 4.1 in red cells. In his Figure 2, Conboy (1993)
provided a map of the alternative splicing of protein 4.1 mRNA,
emphasizing the total chromosome relative to many combinatorial splicing
possibilities among the exons of the EPB41 gene. There are, furthermore,
2 AUG initiation codons, 1 of which accounts for an N-terminal extension
on the 80-kD gene product.

By tissue screening, Baklouti et al. (1997) examined the complex pattern
of alternative splicing variants of the protein 4.1 gene. They noted
that many splicing variations occur in the spectrin/actin binding (SAB)
domain. In particular, they found a 51-bp exon that was expressed almost
exclusively in muscle.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Baklouti et al. (1997) determined that 22
exons spanning approximately 200 kb contain the entire erythroid and
nonerythroid coding sequences of the human protein 4.1 gene.

MAPPING

The protein 4.1 gene was mapped to chromosome 1pter-p32 (Conboy et al.,
1985, 1986) by hybridization to chromosomes sorted onto nitrocellulose
filters using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter. Studies of
translocations also localized the gene to chromosome 1pter-p32, the
region of the Rh gene (Kan, 1986). Thus, it seemed certain that the
protein 4.1 gene is mutant in Rh-linked elliptocytosis-1 (EL1; 611804).

Tang and Tang (1991) concluded that the EL1 gene is located in band
1p34.2-p33 on the basis of the FLpter value (the fractional length of
the total chromosome relative to the terminus of the short arm).

Parra et al. (1998) stated that the EPB41 gene is located on chromosome
1p33-p32.

Bahary et al. (1991) assigned the mouse Epb41 gene to chromosome 4.

GENE FUNCTION

The red cell membrane cytoskeletal network consists of spectrin (bands 1
and 2; see 182860 and 182870), actin (band 5; see 102630), and protein
4.1. Actin and protein 4.1 interact with spectrin at the junction of
spectrin heterotetramers. The resulting complex plays a critical role in
erythrocyte shape and deformability. (The protein band nomenclature
given here is that of Fairbanks et al., 1971.) Correas et al. (1986)
determined the complete primary structure of the functional site of
protein 4.1 involved in spectrin-actin associations. Antibodies against
2 different synthetic peptides of this portion of the protein inhibited
association between protein 4.1, spectrin, and actin.

Ponthier et al. (2006) stated that the 4.1R protein in early erythroid
progenitors, derived from transcripts in which exon 16 is skipped,
exhibits low affinity for spectrin and actin. In contrast, late-stage
erythroblasts include exon 16 and express a high-affinity isoform. This
stage-specific repression of exon 16 inclusion is mediated in part by
the binding of HNRNPA/B (602688) proteins to exonic splicing silencer
elements located within the exon. Ponthier et al. (2006) also found that
FOX1 (A2BP1; 605104) and FOX2 (RBM9; 612149) stimulate exon 16 splicing
into a 4.1R pre-mRNA minigene via specific binding to UGCAUG splicing
enhancer motifs downstream of exon 16.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Conboy et al. (1986) showed by Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA
from an Algerian family that in affected members the mutant protein 4.1
gene had a DNA rearrangement upstream from the initiation codon for
translation. The mRNA from the mutant gene was aberrantly spliced.

Lambert et al. (1988) reported an elliptocytosis family in which an
apparent rearrangement of the coding region of the protein 4.1 gene led
to restriction fragment length polymorphism when DNA was tested using a
fragment of the cDNA that encompassed the coding region of the gene.

McGuire et al. (1988) described a distinct variant of protein 4.1 in
each of 3 families with elliptocytosis. Affected members of family C, of
Italian ancestry, had red cells with reduced content of protein 4.1 of
normal molecular mass (approximately 80 kD).

EVOLUTION

Tan et al. (2005) found that the EPB41 and EPB41L3 (605331) genes from
fish, bird, amphibian, and mammalian genomes exhibit shared features,
including alternative first exons and differential splicing acceptors in
exon 2. In all cases, the most 5-prime exon, exon 1A, splices
exclusively to a weaker internal acceptor site in exon 2, skipping a
fragment designated exon 2-prime. Conversely, alternative first exons 1B
and 1C always splice to the stronger first acceptor site, retaining exon
2-prime. These correlations were independent of cell type or species of
origin. Since exon 2-prime contains a translation initiation site,
splice variants generate protein isoforms with distinct N termini. Tan
et al. (2005) calculated that coupling between upstream promoters and
downstream splicing in EPB41 and EBP41L3 has been conserved for at least
500 million years.

ANIMAL MODEL

The complex EPB41 gene on human chromosome 1p encodes a diverse family
of protein 4.1R isoforms. The prototypic 80-kD 4.1R in mature
erythrocytes is a key component of the erythroid membrane skeleton that
regulates red cell morphology and mechanical stability. To study the
function of 4.1R in nucleated cells, Shi et al. (1999) generated mice
with complete deficiency of all 4.1R protein isoforms. These 4.1R-null
mice were viable, with moderate hemolytic anemia but no gross
abnormalities. Platelet morphology and function were essentially normal.
Nonerythroid 4.1R expression patterns revealed focal expression in
specific neurons in the brain and in select cells of other major organs,
challenging the view that 4.1R expression is widespread among
nonerythroid cells.

Epb41-knockout mice have fragmented red blood cells that lack
glycophorin C (GPC; see 110750). In Epb41-null murine erythroblasts,
Salomao et al. (2010) found that GPC distributed exclusively to the
nuclei, whereas in enucleating erythroblasts from wildtype bone marrow,
GPC partitioned almost exclusively to nascent reticulocytes, with little
or no GPC observed in plasma membranes of extruding nuclei. In contrast,
glycophorin A (GPA; see 111300) partitioning was not perturbed, and GPA
sorted to nascent reticulocytes in both Epb41-null and wildtype
enucleating erythroblasts. The findings indicated that GPC deficiency in
Epb41-null erythroblasts is attributable to markedly abnormal protein
partitioning during enucleation, and suggested that reticulocytes in
hereditary elliptocytosis may differ from normal reticulocytes in their
biophysical properties of membrane cohesion or membrane deformability.
The results also showed that cytoskeletal attachments are an important
factor in regulating transmembrane protein sorting to reticulocytes.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
ELLIPTOCYTOSIS 1
EPB41, 318-BP DEL

This mutation was first reported by Feo et al. (1980) and Tchernia et
al. (1981) in homozygotes and heterozygotes and by Alloisio et al.
(1985) in heterozygotes. In this form of elliptocytosis (611804),
Takakuwa et al. (1986) demonstrated restitution of normal membrane
stability by incorporation of purified protein 4.1 into deficient red
cells by exchange hemolysis.

In an Algerian family with hereditary elliptocytosis caused by
deficiency of erythroid protein 4.1 (described by Tchernia et al., 1981;
defect partially characterized by Conboy et al., 1986), Conboy et al.
(1993) delineated the defect by study of erythroid and nonerythroid
cells in 1 of the homozygously affected sibs. The molecular lesion was
shown to involve deletion of the downstream AUG initiation codon in 4.1
mRNA, thus leading to the absence of protein 4.1 in red cells. In
contrast, isoforms that use the upstream AUG were detected in
nonerythroid cells, thus explaining the absence of manifestations in
other organ systems. The lesion consisted of a 318-nucleotide deletion
that encompassed the downstream AUG but left the upstream AUG intact.
Normally, multiple protein 4.1 isoforms are expressed in a variety of
tissues through complex alternative pre-mRNA splicing events, one
function of which is to regulate use of 2 alternative translation
initiation signals. Late erythroid cells express mainly the downstream
initiation site for synthesis of prototypic 80-kD isoforms; nonerythroid
cells in addition use an upstream site to encode higher molecular mass
isoform(s).

ELLIPTOCYTOSIS 1
PROTEIN 4.1(95)
EPB41, 369-BP DUP

In affected members of family N of Scottish-Irish descent, McGuire et
al. (1988) found heterozygosity for a high molecular weight form of
protein 4.1 at approximately 95 kD, referred to as protein 4.1(95).
Marchesi et al. (1990) described the site and nature of the insertion
resulting in protein 4.1(95) and the functional consequences of the
mutation. The elliptocytosis (611804) was mild without anemia. Protein
4.1(95) was found to contain an insertion of about 15 kD adjacent to the
spectrin/actin domain of the protein comprised, at least in part, of
repeated sequence. Conboy et al. (1990) used polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) techniques to clone and sequence mutant reticulocyte mRNAs and
correlate the duplication end points with exon boundaries of the gene.
Protein 4.1(95) mRNA was found to encode a protein with 2 spectrin/actin
binding domains by virtue of a 369-nucleotide duplication from the codon
for lys407 to that for gln529.

.0004
ELLIPTOCYTOSIS 1
PROTEIN 4.1(68/65)
EPB41, 240-BP DEL

In affected members of family G, of Italian descent, McGuire et al.
(1988) found heterozygosity for normal 4.1(80) and 2 low molecular
weight forms of protein 4.1 at about 68 and 65 kD, referred to as
protein 4.1(68/65). The mutation was associated with moderate
elliptocytosis (611804) and anemia. Protein 4.1(68/65) was found to lack
the entire spectrin/actin binding domain. Conboy et al. (1990)
demonstrated that protein 4.1(68/65) mRNA lacked sequences encoding the
functionally important spectrin-actin binding domain due to a
240-nucleotide deletion spanning the codons for lys407 to gly486.
Marchesi et al. (1990) described the site and nature of the deletions
resulting in protein 4.1(68/65) and the functional consequences of these
mutations.

ELLIPTOCYTOSIS 1
PROTEIN 4.1 MADRID
EPB41, MET1ARG

Dalla Venezia et al. (1992) studied homozygous hereditary elliptocytosis
(611804) in a Spanish patient whose parents were second cousins. He had
had intermittent jaundice and pallor since birth. During aplastic crisis
at the age of 31 years, the spleen was very large and was removed and
cholecystectomy for gallstones was also performed. Remarkable
hematologic improvement followed. The mother of the propositus was
healthy, although her blood smear showed elliptocytosis; the father was
deceased. Glycophorin C was sharply reduced. This finding, as in other
homozygous elliptocytosis cases, indicates that protein 4.1 stabilizes
glycophorin C (110750) in the membrane. Spectrin and actin were
slightly, yet significantly, diminished. Dalla Venezia et al. (1992)
demonstrated an abnormality in 4.1 cDNA, specifically an AUG-to-AGG
transversion in the downstream translation initiation codon, changing
methionine to arginine. No obvious disorders were noted in cell types
other than red cells or possibly sperm cells. The propositus, born in
1948, had infertility associated with azoospermia and a right
ureterocele. Whereas heterozygous 4.1(-) HE accounts for one-fourth to
one-third of all HE in Caucasians, the incidence of homozygous 4.1(-) HE
was, in the opinion of Dalla Venezia et al. (1992), lower than
anticipated. They suggested that some 4.1(-) HE alleles may not be
viable in the homozygous state by virtue of affecting all isoforms of
the protein and leaving all cells deficient in protein 4.1. This was the
first identification of a specific point mutation.

ELLIPTOCYTOSIS 1
PROTEIN 4.1 LILLE
EPB41, MET1THR

Like protein 4.1 Madrid (130500.0001), protein 4.1 Lille cause
elliptocytosis (611804) and results from a mutation in the downstream
translation start site (AUG-to-ACG). See Garbarz et al. (1995).

312173	TITLE *312173 RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN L10; RPL10
;;QM GENE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Ribosomal protein L10 (RPL10) is a highly conserved component of the
large ribosome subunit (60S) that plays a crucial role in protein
synthesis (summary by Gong et al., 2009).

CLONING

In an attempt to isolate a suppressor gene in Wilms tumor (see 194070),
Dowdy et al. (1991) performed a subtractive hybridization assay with a
tumorigenic Wilms tumor cell line and its nontumorigenic derivative,
which contained an extra t(X;11) translocation chromosome. A single
novel cDNA clone, designated QM, was identified. The QM mRNA was
modulated between tumorigenic and nontumorigenic cell lines, making QM
gene an attractive tumor suppressor candidate gene.

In the course of investigating disease genes in the Xqter region, van
den Ouweland et al. (1992) found a cosmid that appeared to harbor the QM
gene, as it demonstrated 100% identity with the cDNA sequence published
by Dowdy et al. (1991).

As an essential step toward an exhaustive analysis of the coding
potential of a large region of the genome, Korn et al. (1992) developed
a protocol allowing the rapid isolation of transcripts defined by
overlapping clone libraries. The technique was applied to the analysis
of transcripts from 2 cosmid contigs, which together encompassed a
region of 900 kb in Xq28. They identified 81 cDNA clones, of which 54
clones were mapped back to the cosmid contigs. Of the 54 clones placed
on the contig maps, 12 cDNA clones were shown to belong to 2 genes that
had previously been reported, L1CAM (308840) and QM.

In the process of characterizing cosmid clones from the Xq28 region,
Kaneko et al. (1992) identified a sequence conserved across species in a
particular clone. Using the conserved sequence as a probe, they isolated
cDNA clones and demonstrated that the nucleotide sequence was the same
as that of the QM cDNA. Dowdy et al. (1991) had demonstrated that the QM
cDNA encodes a predicted hydrophilic 25-kD basic protein primarily
consisting of alpha helices. Southern blot analysis of a somatic cell
hybrid panel suggested that the QM gene belongs to a multigene family
with other representatives on chromosomes 2, 3, 6, 14, 16, and possibly
other chromosomes. Northern blot analysis detected QM expression in all
adult tissues examined, as well as in cell lines, including HeLa cells,
fibroblasts, and somatic cell hybrids, with increased expression in
liver, spleen, testis, and adrenal gland.

QM is a 214-amino acid polypeptide encoded by a gene previously
designated DXS648. It contains a high percentage of charged amino acids
and binds to the JUN oncogene (165160) and to DNA. Although they found
no matches between QM and any other known transcription factors in
searches of DNA databases, Farmer et al. (1994) found a high degree of
conservation throughout the first 175 residues of the protein when
studies were performed on a diverse array of eukaryotes. Most notable
was the considerable conservation of charged amino acids within specific
regions. The rate of sequence divergence of the various homologs was
found to be slow, of the order of 1% change every 22 million years,
consistent with a critical role of QM in eukaryotic cells. Farmer et al.
(1994) suggested that QM belongs to a novel class of transcription
regulatory proteins.

Oh et al. (2002) determined that the 213-amino acid QM protein contains
4 alpha helices, 2 PKC (see 176960) phosphorylation sites, 2
N-myristoylation sites, and 2 amidation sites. QM colocalized with YES1
(164880) in the cytoplasm of several tumor cell lines.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a yeast 2-hybrid assay of a HeLa cell library, Oh et al. (2002)
showed that QM interacted with YES1. Immunoprecipitation analysis and
protein pull-down assays showed that QM interacted with the SRC (190090)
homology-3 (SH3) domain of YES1. QM also interacted with other SRC
family members, including SRC, FYN (137025), HCK (142370), and LYN
(165120). Mutation analysis revealed 2 regions within QM that were
required for YES1 binding, and neither region contained a canonical
SH3-binding motif. Full-length QM suppressed the kinase activity of YES1
by suppressing its autophosphorylation activity. This inhibitory
activity was due predominantly to the C-terminal domain of QM, with
smaller contributions by the 2 SH3-binding regions. QM was not a YES
substrate. Overexpression of QM resulted in increased YES1 mRNA and
protein expression.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kaneko et al. (1992) demonstrated that the QM gene contains at least 7
exons.

MAPPING

Using exon-specific PCR, van den Ouweland et al. (1992) demonstrated
that the QM gene maps to chromosome Xq28 in the region of the G6PD
(305900) and color vision genes (e.g., OPN1LW; 300822).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Klauck et al. (2006) identified 2 missense mutations (L206M, 312173.0001
and H213Q, 312173.0002) in conserved residues at the end of exon 7 of
the RPL10 gene in patients with autism (AUTSX5; 300847). Chiocchetti et
al. (2011) identified an additional family with the H213Q mutation.

- Somatic Mutation in T-cell ALL

De Keersmaecker et al. (2013) identified mutations affecting the
ribosomal proteins RPL5 (603634) and RPL10 (312173) in 12 of 122 (9.8%)
pediatric T-ALLs, with recurrent alterations in RPL10 of arg98, an
invariant residue from yeast to human. Yeast and lymphoid cells
expressing the RPL10 arg98 to ser mutant showed a ribosome biogenesis
defect.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
AUTISM, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, X-LINKED 5
RPL10, LEU206MET

In autistic dizygotic male twins from a German family (AUTSX5; 300847),
Klauck et al. (2006) identified a C-to-A transversion at nucleotide 616
in exon 7 of the RPL10 gene, resulting in a leu-to-met substitution at
codon 206 (L206M). This mutation was found in heterozygosity in the
mother. Leucine at position 206 is conserved through yeast, but an
isoleucine occurs at this codon in Drosophila. The mutation was not
identified in 408 control chromosomes.

.0002
AUTISM, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, X-LINKED 5
RPL10, HIS213GLN

In a German family with 2 brothers affected with autism (AUTSX5;
300847), Klauck et al. (2006) identified a C-to-G transversion at
nucleotide 693 in exon 7 of the RPL10 gene, resulting in a his-to-glu
substitution at codon 213 (H213Q). This mutation was found in both
affected sons, was not identified in the unaffected son or father, and
was identified in heterozygosity in the mother. Histine-213 is conserved
through all vertebrate species tested, including mouse, chicken,
Xenopus, and zebrafish. The mutation was not identified in 408 control
chromosomes.

Chiocchetti et al. (2011) identified another occurrence of this mutation
in an autistic male from a German family. The mother, older sister, and
maternal grandmother all carried the mutation. This family did not
appear to be related to the family reported by Klauck et al. (2006).
Chiocchetti et al. (2011) found normal RPL10 expression in probands with
H213Q mutant alleles, non-RPL10 mutated autism patients, and healthy
controls.

608122	TITLE *608122 PARVIN, GAMMA; PARVG
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the parvin family, including PARVG, are actin-binding
proteins associated with focal contacts.

CLONING

By searching EST databases for sequences similar to mouse Parva
(608120), followed by RT-PCR of a human T-cell line cDNA library, Olski
et al. (2001) cloned human PARVG. Mouse and human PARVG encode a deduced
331-amino acid protein that contains a single actin-binding domain made
up of 2 calponin (600806) homology domains separated by a linker region.
Unlike PARVA and PARVB (608121), the N terminus of PARVG does not
contain nuclear localization signals or SH3-binding domains.

By analyzing PARVG ESTs, Korenbaum et al. (2001) identified
alternatively spliced sequences and a single polyadenylation site.
Northern blot analysis revealed a strong smeared signal in heart, liver,
and several other tissues. Bands of about 1.6 and 4.0 kb were detected
in peripheral blood and spleen. RNA dot blot analysis detected highest
expression in lymphatic organs (spleen, thymus, lymph node, bone marrow,
and peripheral blood leukocytes) and moderate expression in the
digestive tract (stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, ileocecum, and
appendix), lung, and liver. In contrast, mouse Parvg showed highest
expression in testis, where there were at least 6 mRNA species. A 2.8-kb
Parvg transcript was expressed highly in spleen, moderately in lung, and
weakly in brain and heart. Parvg was expressed throughout mouse
embryonic development, with downregulation at embryonic day 11.
Korenbaum et al. (2001) stated that fluorescence-tagged PARVG, like
PARVA, localized at focal contacts.

GENE STRUCTURE

Korenbaum et al. (2001) determined that the PARVG gene contains 15 exons
and spans about 25 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Korenbaum et al. (2001) mapped the PARVG
gene to chromosome 22q13.31, where it lies head to tail about 12 kb
telomeric to the PARVB gene.

606829	TITLE *606829 FRATAXIN; FXN
;;FRDA GENE;;
X25
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Frataxin is a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial iron chaperone involved in
iron-sulfur biogenesis and heme biosynthesis. Some studies have also
suggested that frataxin functions as an iron storage molecule, an
antioxidant, and a tumor suppressor (summary by Schmucker et al.
(2008)).

CLONING

By searching the candidate region defined by analysis of recombination
events in families with Friedreich ataxia (229300), Montermini et al.
(1995) reported that they had located a 150-kb region in chromosome 9q13
that represented the FRDA locus. Campuzano et al. (1996) identified
potential exons in the region in chromosome 9q13 using cDNA selection
and sequence analysis. The FXN gene was isolated by this method and
called X25 by the authors. It encodes a 210-amino acid protein, termed
frataxin. It was shown to be expressed in a range of tissues, most
abundantly in heart. High levels of expression were also found in the
spinal cord; lower levels were detected in the cerebellum, and no
expression was demonstrated in the cerebral cortex.

Koutnikova et al. (1997) cloned the complete coding region of mouse
frataxin and studied its pattern of expression in developing and adult
tissues. Frataxin mRNA was predominantly expressed in tissues with a
high metabolic rate, including liver, kidney, brown fat, and heart. They
showed that mouse and yeast frataxin homologs contain a potential
mitochondrial targeting sequence in their N-terminal domains and that
disruption of the yeast gene results in mitochondrial dysfunction.

GENE STRUCTURE

Campuzano et al. (1996) found that the FXN gene contains 6 exons.

Baralle et al. (2008) stated that the FXN gene contains 7 exons and
spans about 80 kb. The GAA repeat, which when expanded is associated
with disease, is located in the middle of an Alu sequence in the
approximately 11-kb first intron.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Campuzano et al. (1996) mapped the FXN gene to
chromosome 9q13.

GENE FUNCTION

To study frataxin function, Campuzano et al. (1997) developed monoclonal
antibodies raised against different regions of the frataxin protein.
These antibodies detected a processed 18-kD protein in various human and
mouse tissues and cell lines that is severely reduced in Friedreich
ataxia patients. By immunocytofluorescence and immunocytoelectron
microscopy, Campuzano et al. (1997) demonstrated that frataxin is
located in mitochondria, associated with the mitochondrial membranes and
crests. Analysis of cellular localization of various truncated forms of
frataxin expressed in cultured cells and evidence of removal of an
N-terminal epitope during protein maturation demonstrated that the
mitochondrial targeting sequence is encoded by the first 20 amino acids.
Given the shared clinical features between Friedreich ataxia, vitamin E
deficiency, and some mitochondriopathies, Campuzano et al. (1997)
suggested that their data indicate that a reduction in frataxin results
in oxidative damage.

Using the yeast 2-hybrid assay (Fields and Song, 1989), Koutnikova et
al. (1998) identified mitochondrial processing peptidase-beta (MPPB;
603131) as a frataxin protein partner. In in vitro assays, MPPB bound
frataxin which is cleaved by the reconstituted MPP heterodimer. MPP
cleavage of frataxin results in an intermediate form (amino acids 41 to
210) that is processed further to the mature form. In vitro and in vivo
experiments suggested that 2 C-terminal missense mutations found in FRDA
patients, I151F (606829.0004) and G127V (606829.0005), modulate
interaction with MPP-beta, resulting in a slower maturation process at
the normal cleavage site. The slower processing rate of frataxin
carrying such missense mutations may therefore contribute to frataxin
deficiency, in addition to an impairment of its function. Similar
studies were reported by Gordon et al. (1999), with conflicting results.
They performed in vitro experiments with MPP, wildtype and I154F human
frataxin or its mutant yeast homolog, and purified mammalian or yeast
mitochondria. These authors concluded that MPP was capable of 1-step
processing of frataxin to the mature form, and that the I154F mutation
had no effect on mitochondrial import and/or maturation of frataxin.

Schmucker et al. (2008) found that the 210-amino acid FXN precursor
could be processed into several forms in vitro depending upon the assay
conditions. They determined that the physiologically relevant mature
peptide corresponds to amino acids 81 through 210, which is generated by
MPPB in 2 cleavage steps.

Ristow et al. (2000) demonstrated that overexpression of frataxin in
mammalian cells causes a Ca(2+)-induced upregulation of tricarboxylic
acid cycle flux and respiration, which, in turn, leads to an increased
mitochondrial membrane potential and results in an elevated cellular ATP
content. Thus, frataxin appears to be a key activator of mitochondrial
energy conversion and oxidative phosphorylation.

Santos et al. (2001) examined the role of frataxin in neuronal
differentiation by transfecting the P19 embryonic carcinoma cell line
with antisense or sense frataxin constructs. During retinoic
acid-induced neurogenesis of frataxin-deficient cells there was a
striking rise in cell death, while cell division remained unaffected.
However, frataxin deficiency did not affect cell survival in cells
induced to differentiate into cardiomyocytes. Frataxin deficiency
enhanced apoptosis of retinoic acid-stimulated cells, and the number of
neuronal-like cells expressing MAP2 (157130) was dramatically reduced in
these clones. In addition, antisense clones induced to differentiate
into neuroectoderm with retinoic acid had increased production of
reactive oxygen species, and only cells noncommitted to the neuronal
lineages could be rescued by the addition of the antioxidant
N-acetylcysteine (NAC). However, NAC treatment had no effect in
increasing the number of terminally differentiated neuronal-like cells
in frataxin-deficient clones. The authors suggested that frataxin
deficiency may render cells susceptible to apoptosis after exposure to
appropriate stimuli.

Adinolfi et al. (2002) compared the properties of 3 proteins from the
frataxin family (bacterial CyaY from Escherichia coli, yeast Yfh1, and
human frataxin) as representative of organisms of increasing complexity.
The 3 proteins have the same fold but different thermal stabilities and
iron-binding properties. While human frataxin has no tendency to bind
iron, CyaY forms iron-promoted aggregates with a behavior similar to
that of yeast frataxin. Mutants produced to identify the protein surface
involved in iron-promoted aggregation demonstrated that the process is
mediated by a negatively charged surface ridge. Mutation of 3 of these
residues was sufficient to convert CyaY into a protein with properties
similar to those of human frataxin. On the other hand, mutation of the
exposed surface of the beta sheet, which contains most of the conserved
residues, did not affect aggregation, suggesting to the authors that
iron binding is a nonconserved part of a more complex cellular function
of frataxins.

Cavadini et al. (2002) showed that the mature form of human frataxin,
when expressed in E. coli, assembles into a stable homopolymer that can
bind approximately 10 atoms of iron per molecule of frataxin. As
analyzed by gel filtration and electron microscopy, the homopolymer
consists of globular particles of approximately 1 megadalton and orders
rod-shaped polymers of these particles that accumulate small
electron-dense cores. When the human frataxin precursor was expressed in
S. cerevisiae, the mitochondrially-generated mature form was separated
by gel filtration into monomer and a high molecular weight pool of
approximately 600 kD, which was also present in mouse heart. In
radiolabeled yeast cells, human frataxin was recovered by
immunoprecipitation with approximately 5 atoms of iron bound per
molecule. The authors suggested that FRDA may result from decreased
mitochondrial iron storage due to frataxin deficiency, which may impair
iron metabolism, promote oxidative damage, and lead to progressive iron
accumulation.

Shoichet et al. (2002) demonstrated that transgenic overexpression of
human frataxin in murine 3T3-L1 cells increased cellular antioxidant
defense. Subsequent activation of glutathione peroxidase and elevation
of reduced thiols reduced the incidence of malignant transformation
induced by reactive oxygen species, as observed by tumor formation in
nude mice. The authors tentatively suggested a role for frataxin
mutations in the early induction of cancer.

Tan et al. (2003) analyzed gene expression in 3 human cell types using
microarrays and identified 48 transcripts whose expression was
significantly frataxin-dependent in at least 2 cell types. Significant
decreases in 7 transcripts occurred in the sulfur amino acid (SAA)
biosynthetic pathway and the iron-sulfur cluster (ISC) biosynthetic
pathway to which it is connected. Expression of ISC-S and rhodanese
(TST; 180370) transcripts was lower in mutants. Homocystine, cysteine,
cystathionine, and serine were significantly decreased in
frataxin-deficient cell extracts and mitochondria. Succinate
dehydrogenase and aconitase, whose activities require ISCs, were less
active. The ISC-U scaffold protein was specifically decreased in
frataxin-deficient cells, and sodium sulfide partially rescued the
oxidant sensitivity of the FRDA cells. Multiple transcripts involved in
the Fas (134637)/TNF (191160)/INF apoptosis pathway were upregulated in
frataxin-deficient cells, consistent with a multistep mechanism of
Friedreich ataxia pathophysiology and suggesting alternative
possibilities for therapeutic intervention.

By RNA interference (RNAi) of frataxin in HeLa cells, Stehling et al.
(2004) found that the enzyme activity of mitochondrial Fe/S proteins
aconitase (ACO1/IRP1; 100880) and succinate dehydrogenase (SDHA; 600857)
was decreased, while the activity of non-Fe/S proteins remained
constant. Fe/S cluster association with cytosolic IRP1 was diminished.
In contrast, no alterations in cellular iron uptake, iron content, and
heme formation were found, and no mitochondrial iron deposits were
observed upon frataxin depletion. Iron accumulation in FRDA mitochondria
appeared to be a late consequence of frataxin deficiency. Stehling et
al. (2004) concluded that frataxin is a component of the human Fe/S
cluster assembly machinery and that it plays a role in the maturation of
both mitochondrial and cytosolic Fe/S proteins.

Bulteau et al. (2004) found that aconitase (100850) activity can undergo
reversible citrate-dependent modulation in response to prooxidants.
Frataxin interacted with aconitase in a citrate-dependent fashion,
reduced the level of oxidant-induced inactivation, and converted the
inactive [3Fe-4S]1+ enzyme to the active [4Fe-4S]2+ form of the protein.
Bulteau et al. (2004) concluded that frataxin is an iron chaperone
protein that protects the aconitase [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster from disassembly
and promotes enzyme reactivation.

To further discern the role of oxidative stress in FRDA pathophysiology,
Seznec et al. (2005) tested the potential effect of increased
antioxidant defense using an MnSOD mimetic (SOD2; 147460) and Cu-Zn SOD
(SOD1; 147450) overexpression on murine FRDA cardiomyopathy. No positive
effect was observed, suggesting that increased superoxide production
could not solely explain the cardiac pathophysiology associated with
FRDA. Complete frataxin deficiency neither induced oxidative stress in
neuronal tissues nor altered MnSOD expression and induction in early
stages of neuronal and cardiac pathology. Cytosolic ISC aconitase
activity of IRP1 progressively decreased, whereas its apo-RNA binding
form increased despite the absence of oxidative stress, suggesting that
in a mammalian system the mitochondrial ISC assembly machinery is
essential for cytosolic ISC biogenesis. Seznec et al. (2005) concluded
that in FRDA, mitochondrial iron accumulation does not induce oxidative
stress, and FRDA is not associated with oxidative damage.

By immunoprecipitation analysis of mitochondria from human lymphoblasts
and transfected COS-7 cells, Shan et al. (2007) showed that FXN
interacted directly with several mitochondrial proteins, including the
iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis complex component ISD11 (LYRM4; 613311),
the mitochondrial chaperones HSPA9 (600548) and HSP60 (HSPD1; 118190),
the ATP synthase subunit ATP5L, the ATPase ATAD3A (612316), succinate
dehydrogenase subunit A (SDHA; 600857), AFG3L2 (604581), and FXN itself.
Reciprocal immunoprecipitation analysis confirmed the interactions of
FXN with ISD11 and HSPA9 in transfected HEK293 cells. The interaction
between FXN and ISD11 was reversed by EDTA and by several cations at
physiologic concentration, including Fe(3+). However, Ni(2+)
strengthened the interaction between FXN and ISD11. RT-PCR analysis of
lymphoblasts from Friedreich ataxia patients revealed that reduced FXN
mRNA was associated with reduced ISD11 mRNA. Shan et al. (2007) proposed
that FXN deficiency causes transcriptional corepression of genes
involved in iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis.

Using hybrid reporter minigenes with 100 GAA or TTC repeats transfected
into COS or HeLa cells, Baralle et al. (2008) found that both repeats
were efficiently transcribed and inserted into nascent pre-mRNAs that
bound multiple splicing factors. However, the GAA repeats, but not TTC
repeats, caused aberrant splicing of the pre-mRNA. The type of aberrant
splicing depended on the position used for insertion of the GAA repeat,
and the length of the repeat affected the severity of the splicing
abnormality. GAA repeats inserted in a frataxin minigene reduced
splicing efficiency without affecting the abundance of the nascent
transcript. The pathologic expansion induced a block in the processing
of 1 splicing intermediate that accumulated in the nucleus. Baralle et
al. (2008) proposed that the block caused by GAA expansion results from
interference from multiple splicing factors bound to the nascent GAA
repeat-containing transcript, resulting in degradation of the pre-RNA
and lower abundance of mature frataxin mRNA.

To address the physiologic function of human extramitochondrial
frataxin, Condo et al. (2010) searched for ISC-dependent interaction
partners. The authors demonstrated that the extramitochondrial form of
frataxin directly interacted with cytosolic aconitase/iron regulatory
protein-1 (ACO1/IRP1; 100880), a bifunctional protein alternating
between an enzymatic and an RNA-binding function through the
'iron-sulfur switch' mechanism. The cytosolic aconitase defect and
consequent IRP1 activation occurring in FRDA cells were reversed by the
action of extramitochondrial frataxin.

- Studies Using the Yeast Frataxin Homolog

Babcock et al. (1997) characterized a gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae
whose predicted gene product had high sequence similarity to the human
frataxin protein. The yeast gene (yeast frataxin homolog, YFH1) encodes
a mitochondrial protein involved in iron homeostasis and respiratory
function. Human frataxin also was shown to be a mitochondrial protein.

Wilson and Roof (1997) showed that YFH1 localizes to mitochondria and is
required to maintain mitochondrial DNA. They showed that the
YFH1-homologous domain of frataxin functions in yeast and that a
disease-associated missense mutation of this domain, or the
corresponding domain in YFH1, reduces function.

Adamec et al. (2000) expressed a mature form of the YFH1 protein in E.
coli and analyzed its function in vitro. The isolated protein is a
soluble monomer that contains no iron and shows no significant tendency
to self-associate. Aerobic addition of ferrous iron to the protein
resulted in assembly of regular spherical multimers. Each multimer
consists of approximately 60 subunits and can sequester more than 3,000
atoms of iron. Titration of the yeast protein with increasing iron
concentrations supported a stepwise mechanism of multimer assembly.
Sequential addition of an iron chelator and a reducing agent resulted in
quantitative iron release with concomitant disassembly of the multimer,
indicating that the yeast frataxin protein sequesters iron in an
available form. Adamec et al. (2000) proposed that iron-dependent
self-assembly of recombinant yeast frataxin protein reflects a
physiologic role for frataxin in mitochondrial iron sequestration and
bioavailability.

Cavadini et al. (2000) showed that wildtype FRDA cDNA can complement the
YFH1 protein-deficient yeast (YFH1-delta) by preventing the
mitochondrial iron accumulation and oxidative damage associated with
loss of YFH1. The G130V mutation (606829.0005) affected protein
stability and resulted in low levels of mature frataxin, which were
nevertheless sufficient to rescue YFH1-delta yeast. The W173G
(606829.0007) mutation affected protein processing and stability and
resulted in severe mature frataxin deficiency. Expression of the FRDA
W173G cDNA in YFH1-delta yeast led to increased levels of mitochondrial
iron which were not as elevated as in YFH1-deficient cells but were
above the threshold for oxidative damage of mitochondrial DNA and
iron-sulfur centers, causing a typical YFH1-delta phenotype. The authors
concluded that frataxin functions like YFH1 protein, providing
additional experimental support for the hypothesis that FRDA is a
disorder of mitochondrial iron homeostasis.

Gordon et al. (2001) mapped the 2 cleavage sites of the YFH1 protein
precursor. Mutations blocking the first or the second cleavage of YFH1
protein did not interfere with its import from the cytoplasm or with its
ability to complement phenotypes of the YFH1-delta mutant yeast strain.
The first cleaved domain (domain I), consisting of 20 N-terminal amino
acids, was able to import a nonmitochondrial passenger fusion protein.
However, neither domain I nor other matrix-targeting signals alone could
support efficient import of mature YFH1 protein. The second cleaved
domain (domain II), consisting of an additional 31 N-terminal amino
acids, was required as a spacer between a targeting signal and mature
YFH1 protein. Likewise, when YFH1 protein constructs lacking domain I or
II were expressed in vivo, they failed to attain appreciable
steady-state amounts in mitochondria and could not complement phenotypes
of the YFH1-delta mutant.

Karthikeyan et al. (2002) found that the absence of frataxin in yeast
leads to nuclear damage, as evidenced by inducibility of a nuclear DNA
damage reporter, increased chromosomal instability including
recombination and mutation, and greater sensitivity to DNA-damaging
agents, as well as slow growth. Addition of a human frataxin mutant did
not prevent nuclear damage, although it partially complemented the YFH1
mutant in preventing mitochondrial DNA loss. The effects in YFH1 mutants
appeared to result from reactive oxygen species, since (1) YFH1 cells
produce more hydrogen peroxide, (2) the effects are alleviated by the
radical scavenger N-acetylcysteine, and (3) the glutathione peroxidase
gene (GPX1; 138320) prevents an increase in mutation rates. The authors
concluded that the frataxin protein has a protective role for the
nucleus as well as the mitochondria.

Muhlenhoff et al. (2002) constructed a yeast strain (Gal-YFH1) that
carried the YFH1 gene under the control of a galactose-regulated
promoter. Yfh1p-deficient Gal-YFH1 cells were far less sensitive to
oxidative stress than delta-yfh1 mutants, maintained mitochondrial DNA,
and synthesized heme at wildtype rates. Yfh1p depletion caused a strong
reduction in the assembly of mitochondrial Fe/S proteins, which may
explain the respiratory deficiency of Gal-YFH1 cells. Yfh1p-depleted
Gal-YFH1 cells show decreased maturation of cytosolic Fe/S proteins and
accumulation of mitochondrial iron, which may be seen secondary to
defects in cytosolic Fe/S protein assembly. The authors proposed a
specific role of frataxin in the biosynthesis of cellular Fe/S proteins
which excluded most of the previously suggested functions.

Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells lacking the Yfh1 gene showed very low
cytochrome content. Lesuisse et al. (2003) showed that in delta-yfh1
strains, the level of ferrochelatase (612386) was very low as a result
of transcriptional repression of HEM15. However, the low amount of
ferrochelatase was not the cause of heme deficiency in delta-yfh1 cells.
Ferrochelatase, a mitochondrial protein able to mediate insertion of
iron or zinc into the porphyrin precursor, made primarily the zinc
protoporphyrin product. Yfh1p and ferrochelatase were shown to interact
in vitro by BIAcore studies. Lesuisse et al. (2003) concluded that Yfh1
mediates iron use by ferrochelatase.

Karthikeyan et al. (2003) developed a highly regulatable promoter system
for expressing frataxin in yeast to address the consequences of
chronically reduced amounts of this protein. Shutting off the promoter
resulted in changes normally associated with loss of frataxin, including
iron accumulation within the mitochondria and the induction of
mitochondrial 'petite' phenotype mutants. While there was considerable
oxidative damage to mitochondrial proteins, the 'petites' were likely
due to accumulation of mitochondrial DNA lesions and subsequent DNA
loss. Chronically reduced frataxin levels resulted in similar response
patterns. Furthermore, nuclear DNA damage was detected in a rad52 (see
600392) mutant, deficient in double-strand break repair. Karthikeyan et
al. (2003) concluded that reduced frataxin levels, which may be more
representative of the disease state in Friedreich ataxia, resulted in
considerable oxidative damage in both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA.

Campanella et al. (2004) expressed human mitochondrial ferritin (FTMT;
608847) in frataxin-deficient yeast cells. The human FTMT precursor was
efficiently imported by yeast mitochondria and processed to functional
ferritin that actively sequestered iron in the organelle. FTMT
expression rescued the respiratory deficiency caused by the loss of
frataxin protecting the activity of iron-sulfur enzymes and enabling
frataxin-deficient cells to grow on nonfermentable carbon sources.
Furthermore, FTMT expression prevented the development of mitochondrial
iron overload, preserved mitochondrial DNA integrity, and increased cell
resistance to H2O2. Campanella et al. (2004) concluded that FTMT can
substitute for most frataxin functions in yeast, suggesting that
frataxin may be directly involved in mitochondrial iron-binding and
detoxification.

Gonzalez-Cabo et al. (2005) showed that Yfh1 interacted physically with
succinate dehydrogenase complex subunits Sdh1 (SDHA; 600857) and Sdh2
(SDHB; 185470) of the yeast mitochondrial electron transport chain and
also with electron transfer flavoprotein complex ETF-alpha (608053) and
ETF-beta (130410) subunits from the electron transfer flavoprotein
complex. Genetic synthetic interaction experiments confirmed a
functional relationship between Yfh1 and Sdh1/Sdh2, and
coimmunoprecipitation showed physical interaction between human frataxin
and SDH1/SDH2, suggesting also a key role of frataxin in the
mitochondrial electron transport chain in humans. Gonzalez-Cabo et al.
(2005) suggested a direct participation of the respiratory chain in the
pathogenesis of Friedreich ataxia, and proposed that it be considered as
an OXPHOS disease.

Yfh1 interacts functionally and physically with Isu1 (ISCU; 611911), the
scaffold protein on which the Fe/S clusters are assembled. Leidgens et
al. (2010) generated 12 yeast Yfh1 mutants in conserved residues of the
frataxin beta-sheet. The Q129A, I130A, W131A(F), and R141A mutations,
which reside in surface-exposed residues of beta-strands, resulted in
severe cell growth inhibition on high-iron media and low aconitase
activity, indicating that Fe/S cluster biosynthesis was impaired. In
contrast, gln129, trp131, and arg141 residues (which are spatially
closely clustered) defined a patch important for protein function.
Coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that W131A, unlike W131F, was
the sole mutation that strongly decreased the interaction with Isu1.
Leidgens et al. (2010) concluded that trp131, which is the only strictly
conserved frataxin residue in all sequenced species, appears essential
for interaction with Isu1.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Mutation in the FXN gene has been shown to cause one form of Friedreich
ataxia (229300). Most patients with Friedreich ataxia have a GAA-repeat
expansion in the FXN gene. Delatycki et al. (1999) stated that 2% of
cases of Friedreich ataxia are due to point mutations, the other 98%
being due to expansion of a GAA trinucleotide repeat in intron 1. They
indicated that 17 mutations had been described.

Campuzano et al. (1996) screened 184 patients with Friedreich ataxia for
point mutations by PCR amplification of exons. Three different point
mutations were found (606829.0002- 606829.0004). Seventy-nine unrelated
FRDA patients, including 5 with point mutations, were screened for the
GAA repeat expansion in the first intron (606829.0001). In the group of
74 patients without a point mutation, 71 were found to be homozygous for
expanded alleles, and 3 were heterozygous for the expanded repeat. The 5
patients shown to carry point mutations were all found to be
heterozygous for the repeat, and the repeat and the polymorphism had
different parental origin. Repeat expansions in the patients were
typically between 200 and 900 copies. In controls, the repeat expansion
varied from 7 to 22 copies.

Delatycki et al. (1998) studied FRDA mutations in 66 Australian
patients. One of 56 parents had a premutation with 1 normal allele and 1
allele of approximately 100 repeats in leukocyte DNA. His sperm showed
an expanded allele in a tight range centering on a size of approximately
320 repeats. His affected son had repeat sizes of 1,040 and 540. Of 33
other father-to-offspring transmissions, 17 showed a definite decrease
in allele size and 4 showed a decrease or no change; in 12 cases it was
not possible to say if the allele had expanded or contracted in size.
The authors stated that in all informative carrier father-to-affected
child transmissions, other than in the premutation carrier, the
expansion size decreased. Delatycki et al. (1998) concluded that
expansion of the FRDA gene occurs in 2 stages, the first during meiosis
followed by a second mitotic expansion.

Gacy et al. (1998) showed that the GAA instability in Friedreich ataxia
is a DNA-directed mutation caused by improper DNA structure at the
repeat region. Unlike CAG or CGG repeats, which form hairpins, GAA
repeats form a YRY triple helix containing non-Watson-Crick pairs. As
with hairpins, triplex mediates intergenerational instability in 96% of
transmissions. In families with Friedreich ataxia, GAA instability is
not a function of the number of long alleles, ruling out homologous
recombination or gene conversion as a major mechanism. The similarity of
mutation pattern among triple repeat-related diseases indicates that all
trinucleotide instability occurs by a common, intraallelic mechanism
that depends on DNA structure. Secondary structure mediates instability
by creating strong polymerase pause sites at or within the repeats,
facilitating slippage or sister chromatid exchange.

De Castro et al. (2000) analyzed DNA samples from a cohort of 241
patients with autosomal recessive or isolated spinocerebellar ataxia for
the GAA triplet expansion. They found 7 compound heterozygous patients.
In 4 patients, a point mutation that predicted a truncated frataxin was
detected. Three of them were associated with classic early-onset
Friedreich ataxia with an expanded GAA allele greater than 800 repeats.
The fourth patient had disease onset at the late age of 29 years with a
350-GAA repeat expansion. In 2 patients manifesting the classic
phenotype, no changes were observed by SSCP analysis. Linkage analysis
in a family with 2 affected children with an ataxic syndrome, one of
them showing heterozygosity for the GAA expansion, confirmed no linkage
to the FRDA locus. Most point mutations in compound heterozygous
Friedreich patients are null mutations. In their collection of compound
heterozygotes, clinical phenotypes seemed to be related to the GAA
repeat number in the expanded allele.

To investigate the genetic background of apparently idiopathic sporadic
cerebellar ataxia, Schols et al. (2000) tested for CAG/CTG trinucleotide
repeats causing spinocerebellar ataxia types 1, 2 (SCA2; 183090), 3
(SCA3; 109150), 6 (SCA6; 183086), 7 (SCA7; 164500), 8 (SCA8; 608768),
and 12 (SCA12; 604326), and the GAA repeat of the frataxin gene in 124
patients, including 20 patients with the clinical diagnosis of multiple
system atrophy. Patients with a positive family history, atypical
Friedreich phenotype, or symptomatic (secondary) ataxia were excluded.
Genetic analyses uncovered the most common Friedreich mutation in 10
patients with an age of onset between 13 and 36 years. The SCA6 mutation
was present in 9 patients with disease onset between 47 and 68 years of
age. The CTG repeat associated with SCA8 was expanded in 3 patients. One
patient had SCA2 attributable to a de novo mutation from a paternally
transmitted, intermediate allele. Schols et al. (2000) did not identify
the SCA1, SCA3, SCA7, or SCA12 mutations in this group of idiopathic
sporadic ataxia patients. No trinucleotide repeat expansion was detected
in the multiple system atrophy subgroup. This study revealed the genetic
basis in 19% of apparently idiopathic ataxia patients. SCA6 was the most
frequent mutation in late-onset cerebellar ataxia. The authors concluded
that the frataxin trinucleotide expansion should be investigated in all
sporadic ataxia patients with onset before age 40, even when the
phenotype is atypical for Friedreich ataxia.

Sharma et al. (2002) used small-pool PCR to analyze somatic variability
among 7,190 individual FRDA molecules from peripheral blood DNA of
subjects carrying 12 different expanded alleles. Expanded alleles showed
a length-dependent increase in somatic variability, with mutation loads
ranging from 47 to 78%. There was a strong contraction bias among long
alleles (more than 500 triplets), which showed a 4-fold higher frequency
of large contractions versus expansions. Of all somatic mutations
scored, 5% involved contractions of more than 50% of the original allele
length, and 0.29% involved complete reversion to the normal/premutation
length (60 triplets or fewer). These observations contrasted sharply
with the strong expansion bias seen in CTG triplet repeats in myotonic
dystrophy (DM1; 160900). No somatic variability was detected in more
than 6000 individual FRDA molecules analyzed from 15 normal alleles (8
to 25 triplets). A premutation allele with 44 uninterrupted GAA repeats
was found to be unstable, ranging in size from 6 to 113 triplets, thus
establishing the threshold for somatic instability between 26 and 44 GAA
triplets. The authors concluded that expanded GAA alleles in Friedreich
ataxia are highly mutable and have a natural tendency to contract in
vivo, and that these properties may depend on multiple factors,
including DNA sequence, triplet-repeat length, and unknown cell
type-specific factors.

Sharma et al. (2004) reported 2 unrelated patients with late-onset
Friedreich ataxia who were compound heterozygous for a large clearly
pathogenic GAA expansion and a smaller 'borderline' GAA expansion in the
FXN gene. The first patient, who had expansions of 700 and 44 GAA
repeats, developed ataxia symptoms in her early forties. The second
patient, who had expansions of 915 and 66 GAA repeats, developed
symptoms in his late twenties. Genomic analysis of several different
tissues, including hair, skin, buccal cells, peripheral leukocytes, and
fibroblasts, showed somatic instability of both the 44 and 66 repeat
alleles. Cells from both patients showed an increase in mutation load,
the proportion of individual FRDA molecules that differed in length from
the constitutional allele by greater than 5%. Fifteen percent of the
GAA-44 and 75% of the GAA-66 cells contained alleles with greater than
66 repeats. The 53-year-old asymptomatic brother of the first patient
had alleles of 730 and 37 GAA repeats; the GAA-37 allele was somatically
stable. Sharma et al. (2004) concluded that borderline expanded FRDA
alleles ranging from 44 to 65 uninterrupted triplet repeats show somatic
variability and may result in a disease phenotype if a large enough
proportion of cells bear disease-causing expansions in pathologically
affected tissues. Thus, persons who are compound heterozygous for a
large repeat expansion and a borderline expansion have an increased risk
of disease development.

In order to gain insight into GAA triplet repeat instability, Clark et
al. (2004) analyzed all triplet repeats in the human genome. They
determined that the GAA triplet repeat has a significant tendency to
expand compared with all other triplet repeats. Eighty-nine percent of
GAA repeats of 8 or more map to the G/A islands of Alu elements, and 58%
map to Alu element poly(A) tails. Clark et al. (2004) found that only 2
other GAA repeats of 8 or more share the central Alu location seen at
the FRDA locus. Clark et al. (2004) theorized that the GAA repeat
coevolved with Alu elements during primate genomic evolution.

Pathogenic GAA repeat expansions in the FXN gene cause decreased mRNA
expression of FXN by inhibiting transcription. In peripheral blood cells
of 67 FRDA patients, Castaldo et al. (2008) used pyrosequencing to
perform a quantitative analysis of the methylation status of 5 CpG sites
located within intron 1 of the FXN gene, upstream of expanded GAA
repeats. FRDA patients had increased methylation compared to controls.
Significant differences were found for each CpG site tested, but the
largest differences were found for CpG1 and CpG2 (84.45% and 76.80%
methylation in patients compared to 19.65% and 23.34% in controls).
There was a direct correlation between triplet expansion size and
methylation at CpG1 and CpG2. In addition, a significant inverse
correlation was observed between methylation at CpG1 and CpG2 and age of
disease onset. Castaldo et al. (2008) concluded that epigenetic changes
in the FXN gene may cause or contribute to gene silencing in FRDA.

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

Filla et al. (1996) studied the relationship between the trinucleotide
(GAA) repeat length and clinical features in Friedreich ataxia. The
length of the FA alleles ranged from 201 to 1,186 repeat units. There
was no overlap between the size of normal alleles and the size of
alleles found in FA. The lengths of both the larger and the smaller
alleles varied inversely with the age of onset of the disorder. Filla et
al. (1996) reported that the mean allele length was significantly higher
in FA patients with diabetes and in those with cardiomyopathy. They
noted that there was meiotic instability with a median variation of 150
repeats. Isnard et al. (1997) examined the correlation between the
severity of left ventricular hypertrophy in Friedreich ataxia and the
number of GAA repeats. Left ventricular wall thickness was measured in
44 patients using M-mode echocardiography and correlated with GAA
expansion size on the smaller allele (267 to 1200 repeats). A
significant correlation was found (r = 0.51, p less than 0.001),
highlighting an important role for frataxin in the regulation of cardiac
hypertrophy.

In a study of 187 patients with autosomal recessive ataxia, Durr et al.
(1996) found that 140, with ages at onset ranging from 2 to 51 years,
were homozygous for a GAA expansion that had 120 to 1,700 repeats of the
trinucleotides. About one-quarter of the patients, despite being
homozygous, had atypical Friedreich ataxia; they were older at
presentation and had intact tendon reflexes. Larger GAA expansions
correlated with earlier age at onset and shorter times to loss of
ambulation. The size of the GAA expansions (and particularly that of the
smaller of each pair of alleles) was associated with the frequency of
cardiomyopathy and loss of reflexes in the upper limbs. The GAA repeats
were unstable during transmission. Thus, the clinical spectrum of
Friedreich ataxia is broader than previously recognized, and the direct
molecular test for the GAA expansion is useful for the diagnosis,
prognosis, and genetic counseling.

Pianese et al. (1997) presented data suggesting that (1) the FRDA GAA
repeat is highly unstable during meiosis, (2) contractions outnumber
expansions, (3) both parental source and sequence length are important
factors in variability of FRDA expanded alleles, and (4) the tendency to
contract or expand does not seem to be associated with particular
haplotypes. Thus, they concluded that FRDA gene variability appears to
be different from that found with other triplet diseases.

Bidichandani et al. (1997) found an atypical FRDA phenotype associated
with a remarkably slow rate of disease progression in a Caucasian
family. It was caused by compound heterozygosity for a G130V missense
mutation (606829.0005) and the GAA expansion of the X25 gene. The
missense mutation G130V was the second mutation to be identified in the
X25 gene and the first to be associated with a variant FRDA phenotype.
This and the other reported missense mutation (I154F; 229300.0004)
mapped within the highly conserved sequence domain in the C terminus of
the frataxin gene. Since the G130V mutation was unlikely to affect the
ability of the first 16 exons of the neighboring STM7 gene to encode a
functional phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase, Bidichandani et al.
(1997) questioned the role of STM7 in Friedreich ataxia.

Since Friedreich ataxia is an autosomal recessive disease, it does not
show typical features observed in other dynamic mutation disorders, such
as anticipation. Monros et al. (1997) analyzed the GAA repeat in 104 FA
patients and 163 carrier relatives previously defined by linkage
analysis. The GAA expansion was detected in all patients, most (94%) of
them being homozygous for the mutation. They demonstrated that clinical
variability in FA is related to the size of the expanded repeat: milder
forms of the disease (late-onset FA and FA with retained reflexes) were
associated with shorter expansions, especially with the smaller of the 2
expanded alleles. Absence of cardiomyopathy was also associated with
shorter alleles. Dynamics of the GAA repeat were investigated in 212
parent-offspring pairs. Meiotic instability showed a sex bias:
paternally transmitted alleles tended to decrease in a linear way that
depended on the paternal expansion size, whereas maternal alleles either
increased or decreased in size. All but 1 of the patients with
late-onset FA were homozygous for the GAA expansion; the exceptional
individual was heterozygous for the expansion and for another unknown
mutation. All but 1 of the FA patients with retained reflexes exhibited
an axonal sensory neuropathy. However, preservation of their tendon
reflexes suggested that the physiologic pathways of the reflex arch
remained functional. A close relationship was found between late-onset
disease and absence of heart muscle disease.

Delatycki et al. (1999) studied FRDA1 mutations in FA patients from
Eastern Australia. Of the 83 people studied, 78 were homozygous for an
expanded GAA repeat, while the other 5 had an expansion in one allele
and a point mutation in the other. The authors presented a detailed
study of 51 patients homozygous for an expanded GAA repeat. They
identified an association between the size of the smaller of the 2
expanded alleles and age at onset, age into wheelchair, scoliosis,
impaired vibration sense, and the presence of foot deformity. However,
no significant association was identified between the size of the
smaller allele and cardiomyopathy, diabetes mellitus, loss of
proprioception, or bladder symptoms. The larger allele size was
associated with bladder symptoms and the presence of foot deformity.

Gellera et al. (2007) reported 13 FA patients from 12 unrelated Italian
families who were compound heterozygous for the GAA expansion and a
small mutation in the FXN gene. Two missense and 5 frameshift or
truncating mutations were identified (see, e.g., 606829.0007;
606829.0008). In all 13 patients, there was a significant inverse
correlation between GAA size and age at onset. In 6 patients, age at
onset correlated with residual protein level, and GAA size inversely
correlated with residual protein level. Clinical data were consistent
with the hypothesis that FXN mutations are more severe than GAA
expansions. In patients with a null mutation and the GAA expansion, age
at onset was strongly dependent on the size of the expansion, indicating
that residual protein function derived from the expanded allele.

HISTORY

Duclos et al. (1993) identified a transcript containing the conserved
sequences around the D9S5 locus. The 7-kb transcript corresponded to a
gene designated X11 (APBA1; 602414) which extended at least 80 kb in a
direction opposite D9S15. The gene was expressed in the brain, including
the cerebellum, but was not detectable in several nonneuronal tissues
and cell lines. In situ hybridization of adult mouse brain sections
showed prominent expression in the granular layer of the cerebellum.
Expression was also found in the spinal cord. The cDNA contained an open
reading frame encoding a 708-amino acid sequence that showed no
significant similarity to other known proteins but contained a unique,
24-residue, putative transmembrane segment. On the basis of these
findings, Duclos et al. (1993) suggested that this 'pioneer' gene
represents the FRDA gene. Further studies by Rodius et al. (1994)
excluded X11 as a candidate for the Friedreich ataxia gene.

Carvajal et al. (1995) reported the isolation of a gene from the FRDA
critical region. Although no evidence of mutation was detected in the
transcript, the sequence, which they designated STM7 (602745),
represented only one of the shorter alternatively spliced species
identified by Northern analysis and direct sequencing. Carvajal et al.
(1995) still considered the gene a strong candidate for FRDA. Carvajal
et al. (1996) reported that the X25 gene (frataxin-encoding gene)
described by Campuzano et al. (1996) comprises part of STM7. They
reported that the transcription of both STM7 and X25 occurs from the
centromere toward the telomere, that the reported sequences of STM7 and
X25 did not represent a full-length transcript, that multiple
transcripts for each of these genes are present in Northern blots, and
that several of these transcripts are of similar size. Carvajal et al.
(1996) also reported that less than 10 kb separates the CpG island
identified in the X25/exon 1 from the 3-prime end of STM7/exon 16. They
further demonstrated that the recombinant protein corresponding to the
STM7.1 transcript has phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase
activity. They noted that the ataxia-telangiectasia gene (607585) has
C-terminal similarity to the catalytic domains of phosphatidylinositol
phosphate 3-kinases. This homology, and the observation by Matsumoto et
al. (1996) of an ataxia phenotype in mice lacking the type 1
inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate receptor (147265), provided support for a
defect in the phosphoinositide pathway constituting the pathogenetic
basis of Friedreich ataxia.

Cossee et al. (1997) concluded that there was no strong argument for a
role of STM7 in Friedreich ataxia, while the presence of mutations in
the frataxin gene fulfilled all criteria required of the FRDA gene. In
reply, Chamberlain et al. (1997) presented additional data and stated
the opinion that 'Cossee et al. have failed to present either a
plausible explanation for our original observations or a definitive
argument to contradict our interpretation of the data.' In rebuttal,
Pandolfo (1997) pointed out that no data have been presented showing the
existence of STM7/frataxin transcripts with methods other than RT-PCR,
the existence of a defect in PIP kinase activity in Friedreich patients,
or the existence of disease-causing mutations in STM7. In a review
article, Koenig and Mandel (1997) stated that there was strong evidence
negating the claim that the frataxin exons are alternative 3-prime STM7
exons, namely, the structure of frataxin cDNAs and mouse intronless
pseudogenes, the nature of point mutations found in some patients, and
the size of the endogenous frataxin protein.

ANIMAL MODEL

Koutnikova et al. (1997) cloned the complete coding region of mouse
frataxin and studied its pattern of expression in developing and adult
tissues. They found by in situ hybridization analyses that mouse
frataxin expression correlated well with the main site of
neurodegeneration in Friedreich ataxia, but the expression pattern was
broader than expected from the pathology of the disease. Frataxin mRNA
was predominantly expressed in tissues with a high metabolic rate,
including liver, kidney, brown fat, and heart. They showed that mouse
and yeast frataxin homologs contain a potential mitochondrial targeting
sequence in their N-terminal domains and that disruption of the yeast
gene results in mitochondrial dysfunction.

Cossee et al. (2000) generated a mouse model of Friedreich ataxia by
deletion of exon 4 of the Frda gene, leading to inactivation of the Frda
gene product. Homozygous deletions caused embryonic lethality a few days
after implantation; no iron accumulation was observed during embryonic
resorption, suggesting that cell death may be due to a mechanism
independent of iron accumulation. The authors suggested that the milder
phenotype in humans may be due to residual frataxin expression
associated with the expansion mutations.

Through a conditional gene targeting approach, Puccio et al. (2001)
generated in parallel a striated muscle frataxin-deficient mouse line
and a neuron/cardiac muscle frataxin-deficient line, which Seznec et al.
(2004) showed that in frataxin-deficient mice, Fe-S enzyme deficiency
occurred at 4 weeks of age, prior to cardiac dilatation and concomitant
development of left ventricular hypertrophy, while mitochondrial iron
accumulation occurred at a terminal stage. The antioxidant idebenone
delayed the cardiac disease onset, progression and death of
frataxin-deficient animals by 1 week, but did not correct the Fe-S
enzyme deficiency. The authors concluded that frataxin is a necessary,
albeit nonessential, component of the Fe-S cluster biogenesis, and that
idebenone acts downstream of the primary Fe-S enzyme deficit.

Thierbach et al. (2005) disrupted expression of frataxin specifically in
murine hepatocytes to generate mice with impaired mitochondrial function
and decreased oxidative phosphorylation. These animals had a reduced
life span and developed multiple hepatic tumors. Livers also showed
increased oxidative stress, impaired respiration, and reduced ATP levels
paralleled by reduced activity of iron-sulfur cluster (Fe/S)-containing
proteins, which all led to increased hepatocyte turnover by promoting
both apoptosis and proliferation. Accordingly, phosphorylation of the
stress-inducible p38 MAP kinase (600289) was specifically impaired
following disruption of frataxin. The authors hypothesized that frataxin
may act as a mitochondrial tumor suppressor protein in mammals.

Schoenfeld et al. (2005) microarrayed murine frataxin-deficient heart
tissue, liver tissue, and cardiocytes and observed a transcript
downregulation to upregulation ratio of nearly 2:1 with a mitochondrial
localization of transcriptional changes. Combining all mouse and human
microarray data for frataxin-deficient cells and tissues, the most
consistently decreased transcripts were mitochondrial coproporphyrinogen
oxidase (CPOX; 121300) of the heme pathway and mature T-cell
proliferation 1, a homolog of yeast COX23, which is thought to function
as a mitochondrial metallochaperone. Quantitative RT-PCR studies
confirmed the significant downregulation of Isu1 (ISCU; 611911), CPOX,
and ferrochelatase at 10 weeks in mouse hearts. Mutant cells were
resistant to aminolevulinate-dependent toxicity, and there was increased
cellular protoporphyrin IX levels, reduced mitochondrial heme a and heme
c levels, and reduced activity of cytochrome oxidase, suggesting a
defect between protoporphyrin IX and heme a. Fe-chelatase activities
were similar in mutants and controls, whereas Zn-chelatase activities
were slightly elevated in mutants, supporting the idea of an altered
metal-specificity of ferrochelatase. The authors suggested that frataxin
deficiency may cause defects late in the heme pathway. Since ataxic
symptoms occur in other diseases of heme deficiency, the authors
suggested that the heme defect observed in frataxin-deficient cells
could be primary to the pathophysiological process.

Anderson et al. (2005) used RNA interference (RNAi) to suppress the
Drosophila frataxin homolog (Dfh) and observed. distinct phenotypes in
larvae and adults, leading to giant long-lived larvae and to conditional
short-lived adults. Drosophila frataxin silencing differentially
dysregulated ferritin expression in adults but not in larvae, Silencing
of Dfh in the peripheral nervous system, a specific focus of Friedreich
pathology, permitted normal larval development but imposed a marked
reduction in adult life span. In contrast, Dfh silencing in motor
neurons had no deleterious effect in either larvae or adults. Finally,
overexpression of Sod1 (147450), Sod2 (147460), or Cat (115500) did not
suppress the failure of Dfh-deficient flies to successfully complete
eclosion, suggesting a minimal role of oxidative stress in this
phenotype.

Clark et al. (2007) found that transgenic mice carrying expanded human
FXN GAA repeats (190 or 82 triplets) showed tissue-specific and
age-dependent somatic instability specifically in the cerebellum and
dorsal root ganglia. The GAA(190) allele showed some instability by 2
months and significant expansion by 12 months, slightly greater than
that of GAA(82), suggesting that somatic instability was also repeat
length-dependent. There were lower levels of repeat expansion in
proliferating tissues, indicating that DNA replication per se was
unlikely to be a major cause of age-dependent expansion.

Anderson et al. (2008) showed that ectopic expression of H2O2 scavengers
suppressed the deleterious phenotypes associated with frataxin
deficiency in a Drosophila model of FRDA. In contrast, augmentation with
superoxide scavengers had no effect. Augmentation of endogenous catalase
(CAT; 115500) restored the activity of reactive oxygen species-sensitive
mitochondrial aconitase (ACO2; 100850) and enhanced resistance to H2O2
exposure, both of which were diminished by frataxin deficiency. Anderson
et al. (2008) concluded that H2O2 is an important pathologic substrate
underlying the phenotypes arising from frataxin deficiency in
Drosophila.

Coppola et al. (2009) performed microarray analysis of heart and
skeletal muscle in a mouse model of frataxin deficiency, and found
molecular evidence of increased lipogenesis in skeletal muscle, and
alteration of fiber-type composition in heart, consistent with insulin
resistance and cardiomyopathy, respectively. Since the peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG; 601487) pathway is known
to regulate both processes, the authors hypothesized that dysregulation
of this pathway could play a key role in frataxin deficiency. They
demonstrated a coordinate dysregulation of the PPARG coactivator Pgc1a
(PPARGC1A; 604517) and transcription factor Srebp1 (SREBF1; 184756) in
cellular and animal models of frataxin deficiency, and in cells from
FRDA patients, who have marked insulin resistance. Genetic modulation of
the PPAR-gamma pathway affected frataxin levels in vitro, supporting
PPAR-gamma as a potential therapeutic target in FRDA.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
FRIEDREICH ATAXIA
FRIEDREICH ATAXIA WITH RETAINED REFLEXES, INCLUDED
FXN, (GAA)n EXPANSION

GAA triplet repeat expansions between 200 and 900 copies in the first
intron of the frataxin gene occurred in 71 of 74 FRDA (229300) patients
studied by Campuzano et al. (1996). In unaffected individuals, the
triplet repeat expansion numbered between 7 and 20 units.

Among 101 FRDA patients homozygous for GAA expansion within the X25
gene, Coppola et al. (1999) found that 11 patients from 8 families had
FRDA with retained reflexes in the lower limbs (FARR; see 229300). The
mean size of the smaller allele was significantly less (408 +/- 252 vs
719 +/- 184 GAA triplets) in FARR patients.

.0002
FRIEDREICH ATAXIA
FXN, LEU106TER

In 2 affected members of a French family with Friedreich ataxia
(229300), Campuzano et al. (1996) identified compound heterozygosity for
the FRDA expansion repeat (606829.0001) and a T-to-G transversion in
exon 3 that changed a leucine (TTA) to a stop (TGA). The L106X mutation
came from the father; the other allele carrying the expansion was from
the mother.

.0003
FRIEDREICH ATAXIA
FXN, IVS3, A-G, -2

Campuzano et al. (1996) found compound heterozygosity in a member of a
Spanish family with Friedreich ataxia (229300) for the FRDA expansion
repeat (606829.0001) and an A-to-G transition which disrupted the
acceptor splice site at the end of the third intron.

.0004
FRIEDREICH ATAXIA
FXN, ILE154PHE

Campuzano et al. (1996) studied 5 patients with Friedreich ataxia
(229300) from 3 different Italian families and identified a change from
isoleucine-154 to phenylalanine in exon 4. These patients were
heterozygous for the FRDA expansion repeat (606829.0001). This I154F
mutation was found to occur in 1 out of 417 chromosomes examined from
the same Southern Italian population. Isoleucine at this position was
highly conserved across species. (Koutnikova et al. (1998) referred to
this mutation as ILE151PHE.)

Shan et al. (2007) showed that the I145F mutation did not affect FXN
protein expression following transfection of HEK293T cells. However,
I145F interfered with the interaction of FXN with ISD11 (LYRM4; 613311).

.0005
FRIEDREICH ATAXIA
FXN, GLY130VAL

Bidichandani et al. (1997) found compound heterozygosity for the GAA
triplet-repeat expansion (606829.0001) and a novel missense mutation,
G130V, in 3 sibs with variant Friedreich ataxia (229300). Three of 6
sibs were affected: a male age 42, a male age 39, and a female age 35.
Onset of disease was in the early teens, starting with weakness in the
lower limbs and followed by gradual progression over the ensuing 20
years. Two brothers were still ambulatory, using either a walking stick
or walker, and led fully productive working lives. Their upper limbs
were affected to a lesser extent than their legs and lacked several key
signs. They had sensory loss over the distal limbs, mild to moderate
motor weakness, impaired position and vibratory sense, and hypo- or
areflexia. Bilateral Babinski sign was also present in 1 brother. There
was no atrophy, and muscle tone was normal. Notably, there was no
dysarthria, and coordination was either very mildly affected or normal.
Nerve conduction studies revealed slowing of motor-conduction velocities
and absent sensory-evoked responses. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
revealed cervical spinal cord atrophy. No cardiac abnormalities were
detected. Blood glucose levels were borderline elevated, and mild
glucose intolerance was revealed in a 5-hour glucose-tolerance test. The
sister was somewhat more physically incapacitated than her older 2
brothers. (Koutnikova et al. (1998) referred to this mutation as
GLY127VAL.)

By haplotype analysis in the 4 families that had been described with the
G130V mutation, Delatycki et al. (1999) found results suggesting a
common founder.

Using transfected HEK293T cells, Shan et al. (2007) showed that the
G130V mutation interfered with FXN protein expression.

.0006
FRIEDREICH ATAXIA
FXN, MET1ILE

In 3 independent families, Zuhlke et al. (1998) found that affected
individuals with Friedreich ataxia (229300) were compound heterozygotes
for the repeat expansion (606829.0001) and an ATG-to-ATT (met1-to-ile;
M1I) mutation of the start codon of the FXN gene. Haplotype analysis
using 6 polymorphic chromosome 9 markers showed complete identity of
haplotype in 2 of the 3 chromosomes with the point mutation; the third
case showed partial conformity and may represent a single recombination
event. A common ancestor was suspected. An M1I start codon mutation has
been described in the HBB gene (141900.0430) as the cause of
beta-0-thalassemia, in the OAT gene (258870.0001) as the cause of gyrate
atrophy, in the PAH gene (261600.0048) as the cause of phenylketonuria,
and in the PLP gene (312080.0015) as the cause of Pelizaeus-Merzbacher
disease, but in all of these instances the nucleotide change represented
an ATG-to-ATA transition.

.0007
FRIEDREICH ATAXIA
FXN, TRP173GLY

In 2 unrelated patients with Friedreich ataxia (229300), Cossee et al.
(1999) identified a TGG-to-GGG change in exon 5a of the FXN gene,
resulting in a trp173-to-gly (W173G) substitution.

Gellera et al. (2007) identified a 517T-G transversion, resulting in a
W173G substitution, in compound heterozygosity with the GAA expansion
(606829.0001) in FA patients from 3 unrelated families of Italian
origin. All patients had a severe form of the disorder with relatively
early onset and presence of cardiomyopathy.

Using transfected HEK293T cells, Shan et al. (2007) showed that the
W173G mutation interfered with FXN protein expression.

.0008
FRIEDREICH ATAXIA
FXN, 1-BP DEL, 157C

Gellera et al. (2007) identified a 1-bp deletion (157delC) in the FXN
gene in compound heterozygosity with the GAA expansion (606829.0001) in
patients with Friedreich ataxia (229300) from 4 unrelated families of
Italian origin. The 1-bp deletion resulted in a frameshift and premature
termination of the protein at codon 75. Three of the patients who had
greater than 700 repeat expansions had onset by age 10 years. The fourth
patient, with 170 repeats, had onset at age 32 years.

.0009
FRIEDREICH ATAXIA
FXN, 6-BP DEL/15-BP INS, NT371

In 2 sibs with a rapidly progressive and severe Friedreich ataxia
(229300), Evans-Galea et al. (2011) identified compound heterozygosity
for a GAA expansion of 1,010 repeats in the FXN gene (606829.0001) and a
deletion-insertion mutation in exon 3 (c.371_376del6ins15). The
deletion-insertion mutation was predicted to change amino acid positions
124 through 127 from DVSF to VHLEDT, increasing frataxin from 211 to 214
residues. The mutant protein, if expressed, would have an altered acidic
patch, impairing the interaction of FXN with iron and with the
iron-sulphur cluster assembly factor. One sib had onset at age 4 years
and was wheelchair-bound by age 8. The other had onset at age 5 years
and was wheelchair-bound by age 10. Both had hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy, dysarthria, kyphoscoliosis, decreased joint range,
spasticity, and reduced hand function. Other features included diabetes
mellitus and abnormal ocular function. One patient died at age 20 years.

601012	TITLE *601012 CALCIUM CHANNEL, VOLTAGE-DEPENDENT, N TYPE, ALPHA-1B SUBUNIT; CACNA1B
;;CALCIUM CHANNEL, L TYPE, ALPHA-1 POLYPEPTIDE, ISOFORM 5; CACNL1A5;;
CaV2.2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channels are multisubunit complexes found in
the membrane of many excitable cells that regulate calcium entry (see
601011). N-type calcium channels, which control neurotransmitter release
from neurons, are dihydropyridine-insensitive and
omega-conotoxin-sensitive. The alpha-1 subunit forms the pore through
which calcium enters the cell, and is encoded by a family of at least 5
genes.

CLONING

Williams et al. (1992) cloned the neuronal alpha-1B subunit by probing
brain cDNA libraries with a rabbit probe. RT-PCR revealed 2
alternatively spliced isoforms, encoding predicted products of 2,339
(alpha-1B-1) and 2,237 (alpha-1B-2) amino acids, with 64% and 73%
identity to the rabbit gene product, respectively. Both isoforms are
transcribed only in central nervous system tissue.

MAPPING

Diriong et al. (1995) and Kim et al. (1997) mapped the CACNA1B gene to
chromosome 9q34 by fluorescence in situ hybridization.

GENE FUNCTION

Williams et al. (1992) used transient expression studies in HEK293 cells
to demonstrate that CACNA1B had N-type calcium channel activity.

Using binding and immunoprecipitation assays on adult rat cortical
tissue, Maeno-Hikichi et al. (2003) showed that the enigma-like LIM
domain protein (ENH; 605904) interacts specifically with protein kinase
C-epsilon (PRKCE; 176975) and the C terminus of CACNA1B to form a
macromolecular complex. Functional studies in Xenopus oocytes indicated
that expression of ENH resulted in increased rapid and specific
modulation of N-type calcium channels by PKCE. The authors concluded
that through interactions with a common adaptor protein, the formation
of a kinase-substrate complex is the molecular basis for the specificity
and efficiency of cellular signaling.

The CaV2.2 calcium channel interacts with and is modulated by CRMP2
(602463). Overexpression of CRMP2 leads to increased surface expression
of CaV2.2 on neurons, enhanced calcium currents, and an increase in
stimulated release of the neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide
(CGRP; 114130) from dorsal root ganglia (summary by Brittain et al.,
2011).

ANIMAL MODEL

Kim et al. (2001) found that CaV2.2-null mice were viable and fertile
and showed normal motor coordination. CaV2.2-null mice exhibited reduced
responses to certain pain stimuli, suggesting that CaV2.2 plays a role
in pain perception at the spinal level, but not at the supraspinal
level.

Kim et al. (2009) observed elevated aggression in CaV2.2-null mice.
CaV2.2 is highly expressed in the dorsal raphe nucleus of adult rats,
and injection of an N-type Ca(2+) channel blocker into the dorsal raphe
nucleus of wildtype mice resulted in increased aggressive behavior. Kim
et al. (2009) concluded that N-type Ca(2+) channels in the dorsal raphe
nucleus have a role in the control of aggression.

In rats, Brittain et al. (2011) demonstrated that inflammatory and
neuropathic hypersensitivity can be suppressed by a synthetic 15-mer
peptide (CBD3) that uncouples Crmp2 and CaV2.2 calcium channels in
neurons. Studies in cultured neurons and spinal cord slices showed that
CBD3 peptide bound CaV2.2, interfered with the interaction of Crmp2 and
CaV2.2, and reduced channel function, as evidenced by decreased CGRP
neuropeptide release from sensory neurons and decreased excitatory
synaptic transmission in dorsal horn neurons. In rats, treatment with
CBD3 also reduced meningeal blood flow and reduced nocifensive behavior
induced by peripheral formalin injection or corneal capsaicin
application, as well as reversed neuropathic hypersensitivity produced
by an antiretroviral drug. The peptide was mildly anxiolytic without
affecting memory retrieval, sensorimotor function or depression.

604567	TITLE *604567 DOUBLE C2-LIKE DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN, ALPHA; DOC2A
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

C2-like domains that interact with Ca(2+) and phospholipid are found in
synaptotagmin (see 600103) and rabphilin-3A (RPH3A; 612159), proteins
implicated in neurotransmitter release. By screening a human brain cDNA
library with a fragment showing homology to rabphilin-3A, Orita et al.
(1995) isolated a novel cDNA which they named DOC2 for 'double C2.' The
cDNA predicts a 400-amino acid protein with relative mass of 44,071 Da
and 2 repeated C2-like domains in the C-terminal region. Northern blot
analysis showed high levels of a 2.2-kb DOC2 transcript in brain.
Expression of a recombinant DOC2 protein in E. coli showed that it
interacts with Ca(2+) and phospholipid.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the DOC2A
gene to chromosome 16 (TMAP RH99266).

604374	TITLE *604374 METALLOTHIONEIN-LIKE 5, TESTIS-SPECIFIC; MTL5
;;TESTIS-SPECIFIC METALLOTHIONEIN-LIKE PROTEIN; TESMIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By randomized RT-PCR on mRNA from mouse tissues, Sugihara et al. (1999)
isolated a testis-specific transcript, which they called TF1. By
screening a human testis cDNA library with TF1 as a probe, they cloned a
novel cDNA, which they called testis-specific metallothionein-like
protein, or tesmin. Tesmin encodes a predicted cysteine-rich, 295-amino
acid protein that is 76.3% homologous to mouse tesmin. Sequence analysis
revealed the presence of 2 metallothionein (MT)-like motifs. MT
expression has been observed to be higher in testes than in liver tissue
(Salehi-Ashtiani et al., 1993) and to be actively expressed in a
developmentally regulated fashion in mouse male germ cells (De et al.,
1991). Tesmin shows no homology to other testis-specific genes. In situ
hybridization of adult mouse testicular sections showed that expression
of tesmin is restricted to spermatocytes. RT-PCR analysis on testicular
transcripts from mice showed that expression of tesmin occurs as early
as day 8 and coincides with the entry of germ cells in meiosis.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Sugihara et al. (1999) mapped the
MTL5 gene to human chromosome 11q13.2-q13.3 and mouse chromosome 19B.

612760	TITLE *612760 SNF-RELATED KINASE; SNRK
;;SNF1-RELATED KINASE;;
KIAA0096
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SNRK is a member of the sucrose nonfermenting (SNF)-related kinase
family of serine/threonine kinases (Kertesz et al., 2002).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated KG-1 immature
myeloid cell line cDNA library, Nagase et al. (1995) obtained a partial
SNRK clone, which they designated KIAA0096. The deduced protein has a
prenylation site. Northern blot analysis detected SNRK expression in all
tissues and cell lines examined, with highest expression in peripheral
blood leukocytes.

Using the partial cDNA clone KIAA0096 isolated by Nagase et al. (1995)
and the corresponding rat Snrk cDNA for 5-prime RACE, Kertesz et al.
(2002) cloned full-length human SNRK from KG-1 cell RNA. The deduced
766-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 84.27 kD and
shares 88% identity with mouse Snrk. Human, rat, and mouse SNRK proteins
share a conserved serine/threonine kinase catalytic domain, a bipartite
nuclear targeting signal, and an SNF1 homology domain (SNH), the latter
being characteristic of some SNF1-related proteins and also found within
a ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain in ubiquitin pathway enzymes.

By RT-PCR of CD34+ cell subsets sorted by FACS analysis, Kertesz et al.
(2002) detected significantly lower SNRK expression in quiescent
CD34+/CD38- cells compared to highly proliferating CD34+/CD38+ cells and
suggested that SNRK may be involved in hematopoietic proliferation. In
addition, they detected SNRK expression in numerous leukemic cell lines
with the exception of TF-1 cells. Whole-mount in situ hybridization of
mouse embryos detected Snrk expression at 8-8.5 days postcoitum
extending dorsally along the epithelium of the differentiating neural
tube. After 12.5 days postcoitum, Snrk expression became more restricted
to the caudal neurotube and neuropore. Snrk expression was also detected
in developing primitive gut endoderm, and pericardium of the developing
heart, aorta, and endothelial and hematopoietic cells of the yolk-sac
blood islands and vessels. Later in development, 12.5-14.5 days
postcoitum, Snrk expression persisted in the endocardium and heart
septum with decreased neural tube and gut expression. RT-PCR of adult
mouse tissues detected strong Snrk expression in kidney, liver, testis,
thymus, lymph node, and spleen with lower expression in brain, heart,
and lung.

Of 9 rat tissues studied by immunoprecipitation, immunoblot, and
activity assay, Jaleel et al. (2005) detected Snrk protein and enzymatic
activity only in testis.

GENE FUNCTION

By in vitro kinase assay of recombinant SNRK, Kertesz et al. (2002)
demonstrated that SNRK acts as a kinase and displays autophosphorylation
activity.

Jaleel et al. (2005) identified SNRK as a substrate for the LKB1 tumor
suppressor (STK11; 602216), which phosphorylated SNRK at residue thr173.
LKB1 is required for phosphorylation and activation of SNRK in HeLa
cells and required STRAD (608626) and MO25 (see CAB39, 612174) LKB1
complex-associated subunits.

Using morpholino-mediated gene knockdown in zebrafish, Pramanik et al.
(2009) showed that Dusp5 (603069) and Snrk1 targeted a common signaling
pathway and coordinately functioned in controlling angioblast numbers at
the lateral plate mesoderm.

Using gain- and loss-of-function studies, Chun et al. (2009) showed that
Snrk1 played an essential role in the migration, maintenance, and
differentiation of angioblasts in zebrafish. The kinase function of
Snrk1 was critical for migration and maintenance, but not for
differentiation of angioblasts. In vitro, Snrk1-knockdown endothelial
cells showed only defects in migration. Snrk1 acted downstream or
parallel to Notch (NOTCH1; 190198) and upstream of gridlock (HEY2;
604674) during artery-vein specification. The human SNRK gene
compensated for zebrafish Snrk1 knockdown, suggesting conservation of
function.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kertesz et al. (2002) determined that the SNRK gene contains 6 exons
spanning 39.8 kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1995) mapped the SNRK gene
to chromosome 3. By genomic sequence analysis, Kertesz et al. (2002)
mapped the SNRK gene to chromosome 3p21.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Somatic Mutations

Pramanik et al. (2009) identified a somatic arg248-to-gln (R248Q)
mutation in the SNRK gene in 8 of 24 vascular anomaly samples, including
venous and lymphatic malformations, but not infantile hemangiomas
(602089). Six of the 8 samples also carried a somatic ser147-to-pro
(S147P) mutation in the DUSP5 gene. Since studies in zebrafish
implicated a role for the Dusp5/Snrk signaling pathway in vascular
development, the findings suggested that variation in these genes may
provide susceptibility to the development of vascular anomalies in
humans.

604712	TITLE *604712 RIBONUCLEOTIDE REDUCTASE, M2 B; RRM2B
;;RIBONUCLEOTIDE REDUCTASE SMALL SUBUNIT 2-LIKE, p53-INDUCIBLE; P53R2;;
p53-INDUCIBLE AND RIBONUCLEOTIDE REDUCTASE SMALL SUBUNIT 2-LIKE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The RRM2B gene encodes the small subunit of p53 (191170)-inducible
ribonucleotide reductase, a heterotetrameric enzyme responsible for de
novo conversion of ribonucleoside diphosphates into the corresponding
deoxyribonucleoside diphosphates that are essential for DNA synthesis
(Bourdon et al., 2007).

CLONING

The p53 gene is frequently inactivated in human cancers. By using
differential display to examine mRNAs in a human colon cancer cell line
carrying a highly regulated wildtype p53 expression system, Tanaka et
al. (2000) detected a 5.5-kb transcript that was inducible by wildtype
p53 but not mutant p53. Using the differential display fragment
representing this transcript as a probe to screen a skeletal muscle cDNA
library, they isolated a cDNA sequence that incorporated an open reading
frame of 351 amino acids with 80% identity to the small subunit of human
ribonucleotide reductase (R2; 180390). Comparison of this sequence,
which they called p53R2 for 'p53-inducible ribonucleotide reductase
small subunit 2 homolog,' with those of yeast RNR2 and RNR4 revealed 60%
and 40% identity, respectively. Tanaka et al. (2000) considered p53R2 to
be a human counterpart of yeast RNR2. The protein has a ribonucleotide
reductase small subunit signature and 2 putative nuclear localization
signal sequences.

GENE STRUCTURE

Tanaka et al. (2000) found that the p53R2 gene consists of 9 exons and
spans a 30-kb genomic region. Electromobility shift assays identified a
20-nucleotide region in intron 1 as the p53 binding site.

MAPPING

Tanaka et al. (2000) mapped the p53R2 gene to chromosome 8q23.1 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization.

GENE FUNCTION

Tanaka et al. (2000) found that expression of p53R2, but not R2, was
induced by ultraviolet and gamma-irradiation and adriamycin treatment in
a wildtype p53-dependent manner. Induction of p53R2 in p53-deficient
cells caused G2/M arrest and protected cells from death in response to
adriamycin. Inhibition of endogenous p53R2 expression in cells that had
an intact p53-dependent DNA damage checkpoint reduced ribonucleotide
reductase activity, DNA repair, and cell survival after exposure to
various genotoxins. Tanaka et al. (2000) demonstrated nuclear
accumulation of p53R2 protein in response to genotoxic stress induced by
gamma-irradiation. Tanaka et al. (2000) concluded that p53R2 encodes a
ribonucleotide reductase that is directly involved in the p53 checkpoint
for repair of damaged DNA. The discovery of p53R2 clarified a
relationship between a ribonucleotide reductase activity involved in
repair of damaged DNA and tumor suppression by p53. Tanaka et al. (2000)
proposed that inactivation of p53 directly interferes with the
transcription of p53R2 in response to DNA damage, with the result that
ribonucleotide reductase activity is insufficient for normal DNA repair.
Faulty regulation of p53R2 might also enhance misincorporation of
deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs) and dysregulation of DNA
repair machinery and thereby increase the frequency of mutations. Tanaka
et al. (2000) suggested that the genomic instability often seen in
tumors lacking wildtype p53 may reflect dysfunction of ribonucleotide
reductase due to the failure of p53R2 induction.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Mitochondrial DNA Depletion Syndrome 8A (Encephalomyopathic
Type with Renal Tubulopathy)

In 7 patients from 4 families with severe autosomal recessive
mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion syndrome-8A (MTDPS8A; 612075),
associated with renal tubulopathy, Bourdon et al. (2007) identified
homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the RRM2B gene (see,
e.g., 604712.0001-604712.0005). All patients had 1 to 2% residual mtDNA
in skeletal muscle and died in the first months of life with severe
lactic acidosis. Respiratory chain complex activities were severely
decreased in muscle from these patients. The findings indicated that
RRM2B plays a crucial role in dNTP supply, especially for the synthesis
of mtDNA.

- Mitochondrial DNA Depletion Syndrome 8B (MNGIE Type)

Shaibani et al. (2009) identified compound heterozygosity for 2
mutations in the RRM2B gene (R110H, 604712.0008; R121H, 604712.0009) in
a 42-year-old woman with mtDNA depletion syndrome-8B, manifest as a
neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy (see 612075). The authors stated
that this was the oldest reported patient with RRM2B mutations and that
her clinical course was different from that reported previously in
patients with MNGIE.

- Autosomal Dominant Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia
5

By linkage analysis followed by candidate gene sequencing in a large
North American family with mild autosomal dominant progressive external
ophthalmoplegia-5 (PEOA5; 613077), Tyynismaa et al. (2009) identified a
heterozygous mutation in the RRM2B gene (R327X; 604712.0006) that
segregated with the disorder. Affected members of an unrelated Hungarian
family carried the same mutation, but there was no evidence of a common
origin.

By direct sequencing of the RRM2B gene in 75 unrelated probands with PEO
in whom mutations in other known PEO-related genes had been excluded,
Fratter et al. (2011) identified 3 different heterozygous truncating
mutations in the RRM2B gene (see, e.g., 604712.0010 and 604712.0011) in
7 (9.3%) patients. The findings suggested that truncating RRM2B
mutations are rather frequent in familial PEO with mtDNA deletions.
Three additional patients were found to carry 3 different heterozygous
missense variants, but the pathogenicity of the variants was considered
provisional in the absence of further supporting evidence.

ANIMAL MODEL

To determine whether ribonucleotide reductase is involved in DNA repair
by supplying deoxyribonucleotides (dNTPs) for resting cells in vivo,
Kimura et al. (2003) generated a strain of mice lacking Rrm2b. These
mice developed normally until they were weaned but from then on had
growth retardation and early mortality. Pathologic examination indicated
that multiple organs had failed, and all Rrm2b-null mice died from
severe renal failure by the age of 14 weeks. TUNEL staining showed a
greater number of apoptotic cells in kidneys of 8-week-old null mice
relative to wildtype. p53 (191170) was activated in kidney tissues of
the null mice, leading to transcriptional induction of p53 target genes.
Embryonic fibroblasts from null mice became immortal much earlier than
wildtype embryonic fibroblasts. dNTP pools were severely attenuated in
embryonic fibroblasts from null mice under oxidative stress. Rrm2b
deficiency caused higher rates of spontaneous mutation in the kidneys of
null mice. The results suggested that p53R2 has a pivotal role in
maintaining dNTP levels for repair of DNA in resting cells. Impairment
of this pathway may enhance spontaneous mutation frequency and activate
p53-dependent apoptotic pathways in vivo, causing severe renal failure,
growth retardation, and early mortality.

Bourdon et al. (2007) found that 12-week-old Rrm2b-null mice had
markedly decreased mtDNA content in kidney (5.57% of controls), muscle
(5.24%), and liver (21%).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MITOCHONDRIAL DNA DEPLETION SYNDROME 8A (ENCEPHALOMYOPATHIC TYPE WITH
RENAL TUBULOPATHY)
RRM2B, GLN284TER

In 3 sibs, born of consanguineous Moroccan parents, with mitochondrial
DNA depletion syndrome-8A (MTDPS8A; 612075), manifest as
encephalomyopathy and renal tubulopathy, Bourdon et al. (2007)
identified a homozygous 850C-T transition in the RRM2B gene, resulting
in a gln284-to-ter (Q284X) substitution. The substitution resulted in
the deletion of the last 68 C-terminal residues of the protein,
including part of the an alpha-helix as well as the heptapeptide
involved in the binding to R1. The sibs had hypotonia and lactic
acidosis and died within the first months of life. Severe mtDNA
depletion (less than 1% of controls) was found in muscle of 1 the sibs.

.0002
MITOCHONDRIAL DNA DEPLETION SYNDROME 8A (ENCEPHALOMYOPATHIC TYPE WITH
RENAL TUBULOPATHY)
RRM2B, IVS3AS, A-G, -2

In 2 French infants with mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome-8A
(612075), manifest as encephalomyopathy with renal tubulopathy, Bourdon
et al. (2007) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the
RRM2B gene: an A-to-G transition in intron 3 and E194K (604712.0003).
The sibs had lactic acidemia, hypotonia, tubulopathy, and seizures. Only
2% of normal mtDNA levels was detected in the muscle of 1 of the sibs.
Both died at 2 months of age.

.0003
MITOCHONDRIAL DNA DEPLETION SYNDROME 8A (ENCEPHALOMYOPATHIC TYPE WITH
RENAL TUBULOPATHY)
RRM2B, GLU194LYS

In 2 French infants with mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome-8A
(612075), manifest as encephalomyopathy with renal tubulopathy, Bourdon
et al. (2007) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the
RRM2B gene: a 580G-A transition, resulting in a glu194-to-lys (E194K)
substitution, and a splice site mutation (604712.0002). Residue 194 is
involved in iron binding.

.0004
MITOCHONDRIAL DNA DEPLETION SYNDROME 8A (ENCEPHALOMYOPATHIC TYPE WITH
RENAL TUBULOPATHY)
RRM2B, 3-BP DEL, 253GAG

In a French infant with severe mitochondrial DNA depletion with renal
tubulopathy (612075), Bourdon et al. (2007) identified compound
heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the RRM2B gene: a 3-bp deletion
(253delGAG), resulting in an in-frame deletion of glu85, and C236F
(604712.0005). The patient had neonatal hypotonia and increased plasma
and CSF lactate; she died at age 3 months. Muscle histology showed
ragged-red fibers, and mtDNA content was about 1% of normal. The
deletion of glu85 was predicted to disrupt the local subdomain structure
and the dimerization interface between R1 and R2.

.0005
MITOCHONDRIAL DNA DEPLETION SYNDROME 8A (ENCEPHALOMYOPATHIC TYPE WITH
RENAL TUBULOPATHY)
RRM2B, CYS236PHE

In a French infant with severe mitochondrial DNA depletion with renal
tubulopathy (612075), Bourdon et al. (2007) identified compound
heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the RRM2B gene: a 707G-T transversion,
resulting in a cys236-to-phe (C236F) substitution, and a 3-bp deletion
(604712.0004).

.0006
PROGRESSIVE EXTERNAL OPHTHALMOPLEGIA WITH MITOCHONDRIAL DNA DELETIONS,
AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT, 5
RRM2B, ARG327TER

In affected members of 2 unrelated families with autosomal dominant
progressive external ophthalmoplegia-5 (PEOA5; 613077), Tyynismaa et al.
(2009) identified a heterozygous 979C-T transition in the last exon of
the RRM2B gene, resulting in an arg327-to-ter (R327X) substitution. The
substitution was predicted to result in a protein lacking the last 25
amino acids. One family was North American of European origin, and the
second was Hungarian. The mutation was not observed in 380 control
European chromosomes, and there was no evidence of a founder effect. The
phenotype was characterized by late-onset of mild ophthalmoplegia and
mild muscle weakness. Skeletal muscle biopsies showed mtDNA deletions,
but normal mtDNA copy numbers. RNA studies showed that the R328X mRNA
escaped nonsense-mediated decay, and that the mutant protein was
expressed and stable. The findings suggested that the mutant RRM2B
protein can compete with wildtype in binding to ribonucleotide
reductase, causing a dominant-negative or gain-of-function effect.

.0007
MITOCHONDRIAL DNA DEPLETION SYNDROME 8A (ENCEPHALOMYOPATHIC TYPE WITH
RENAL TUBULOPATHY)
RRM2B, GLY229VAL

In 2 Sudanese brothers, born of consanguineous parents, with
encephalomyopathic mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome (612075),
Kollberg et al. (2009) identified a homozygous 686G-T transversion in
exon 7 of the RRM2B gene, resulting in a gly229-to-val (G229V)
substitution in the diferric iron center of the protein. Each unaffected
parent was heterozygous for the mutation. The phenotype was severe, with
hypotonia, seizures, poor visual contact, and lactic acidosis, and both
patients died by 5 months of age. One boy developed a proximal renal
tubulopathy. Southern blot analysis of patient cells showed severe mtDNA
depletion, about 1 to 4% of normal controls.

.0008
MITOCHONDRIAL DNA DEPLETION SYNDROME 8B (MNGIE TYPE)
RRM2B, ARG110HIS

In a 42-year-old woman with mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome-8B,
manifest as mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy syndrome
(MNGIE; see 612075), Shaibani et al. (2009) identified compound
heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the RRM2B gene: a 329G-A transition
resulting in an arg110-to-his (R110H) substitution, and a 362G-A
transition resulting in an arg121-to-his (R121H; 604712.0009)
substitution. Both mutations occurred in highly conserved residues. The
patient developed recurrent nausea, vomiting, and weight loss at age 30
years. At age 37, she developed restriction of eye movements, ptosis,
dysarthria, unsteady gait, muscle weakness, and areflexia consistent
with a peripheral neuropathy. Skeletal muscle showed mtDNA depletion
(12% of controls). Shaibani et al. (2009) noted that this was the oldest
reported patient with RRM2B mutations and that her clinical course was
different from that reported previously in patients with MNGIE. The
findings also broadened the phenotype associated with RRM2B mutations to
include an MNGIE-like picture.

.0010
PROGRESSIVE EXTERNAL OPHTHALMOPLEGIA WITH MITOCHONDRIAL DNA DELETIONS,
AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT, 5
RRM2B, 1-BP DEL, 950T

In 3 unrelated patients with PEOA5 (613077), Fratter et al. (2011)
identified a heterozygous 1-bp deletion (950delT) in the RRM2B gene,
resulting in a frameshift and premature termination at leu317. The
patients had onset at ages 30, 53, and 46 years, and all had a family
history of the disorder. All had PEO and ptosis, but additional variable
features in 2 patients included fatigue, ataxia, proximal myopathy,
dysphagia, and glaucoma. Skeletal muscle biopsies of the probands showed
a mosaic defect of cytochrome c oxidase activity and multiple mtDNA
deletions. The mutation was not found in 352 control alleles.

.0011
PROGRESSIVE EXTERNAL OPHTHALMOPLEGIA WITH MITOCHONDRIAL DNA DELETIONS,
AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT, 5
RRM2B, 1-BP DUP, 965A

In 3 unrelated patients with PEOA5 (613077), Fratter et al. (2011)
identified a heterozygous 1-bp duplication (965dupA) in the RRM2B gene,
resulting in a frameshift and premature termination. The patients had
onset at ages 30, 54, and 26 years, and all had a family history of the
disorder. All had PEO and fatigue, but additional features were variable
and included diabetes, gastrointestinal symptoms, dysphagia, dysphonia,
and proximal myopathy. Skeletal muscle biopsies of the probands showed a
mosaic defect of cytochrome c oxidase activity and multiple mtDNA
deletions. The mutation was not found in 352 control alleles.

.0012
VARIANT OF UNKNOWN SIGNIFICANCE
RRM2B, PHE202LEU

This variant is classified as a variant of unknown significance because
its contribution to progressive external ophthalmoplegia has not been
confirmed.

In a 14-year-old patient with early-onset progressive external
ophthalmoplegia at age 4 and hearing loss, Fratter et al. (2011)
identified compound heterozygous changes in the RRM2B gene: a 606T-A
transversion resulting in a phe202-to-leu (F202L) substitution, and an
817G-A transition resulting in a gly273-to-ser (G273S; 604712.0013)
substitution. Functional studies of the variants were not performed.
Skeletal muscle biopsy showed a mosaic defect of cytochrome c oxidase
activity and multiple mtDNA deletions. Neither variant was found in 352
control alleles, and both occurred in conserved residues. There was no
family history of a similar disorder, but information on the parents was
not provided. The findings suggested recessive inheritance of the
disorder.

.0013
VARIANT OF UNKNOWN SIGNIFICANCE
RRM2B, GLY273SER

See 604712.0012 and Fratter et al. (2011).

.0014
VARIANT OF UNKNOWN SIGNIFICANCE
RRM2B, PRO33SER

This variant is classified as a variant of unknown significance because
its contribution to progressive external ophthalmoplegia has not been
confirmed.

In a 43-year-old Japanese man, born of consanguineous parents, with
adult-onset progressive external ophthalmoplegia, Takata et al. (2011)
identified a homozygous 341G-A transition in the RRM2B gene, resulting
in a pro33-to-ser (P33S) substitution in a highly conserved residue in
the N terminus. The variant was found by whole-exome sequencing in
combination with runs of homozygosity analysis. Each unaffected parent
was heterozygous for the mutation, which was found in 1 of 718 control
chromosomes of Japanese origin. Functional studies of the variant were
not performed. The patient presented with hearing loss at age 16 years,
and later developed ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, and muscle weakness. He
also had pigmentary degeneration of the retina and gonadal atrophy.
Other features included depressed mood, anxiety, and hypochondriacal
complaints. Muscle biopsy showed marked variation of fiber size,
ragged-red fibers, COX-negative fibers, and multiple mtDNA deletions.
There was no family history of a similar disorder. Mutations in other
candidate genes were excluded. Takata et al. (2011) suggested that this
was the first case of recessive inheritance of PEO due to RRM2B
mutations.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the ZAS family, such as ZAS2 (HIVEP2), are large proteins
that contain a ZAS domain, a modular protein structure consisting of a
pair of C2H2 zinc fingers with an acidic-rich region and a
serine/threonine-rich sequence. These proteins bind specific DNA
sequences, including the kappa-B motif (GGGACTTTCC), in the promoters
and enhancer regions of several genes and viruses, including human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV). ZAS genes span more than 150 kb and
contain at least 10 exons, one of which is longer than 5.5 kb (summary
by Allen and Wu, 2004).

CLONING

Using the DNA-binding domain of HIVEP1 (194540) as probe, Nomura et al.
(1991) cloned HIVEP2 from T-cell and umbilical vein endothelial cell
cDNA libraries. The deduced 1,833-amino acid protein has a calculated
molecular mass of 202.1 kD. Northern blot analysis detected a 9.5-kb
transcript in a human T-cell line and in some tumor cell lines.

GENE FUNCTION

Nomura et al. (1991) found that expression of HIVEP2 increased about
10-fold following mitogen or phorbol ester stimulation of the Jurkat
human T-cell line. HIVEP2 bound to the HIV enhancer and other related
sequences. Similar to HIVEP1, HIVEP2 showed higher affinity for the
major histocompatibility enhancer than for the HIV enhancer.

Dorflinger et al. (1999) showed that rodent Mibp1 bound specifically to
a TC box in the human SSTR2 (182452) promoter and could activate
transcription. Mibp1 interacted with Sef2 (TCF4; 602272) to enhance
transcription from the basal Sstr2 promoter in murine brain.

Jin et al. (2006) found that Shn2 entered the nucleus of mouse embryonic
fibroblasts upon Bmp2 (112261) stimulation and that, in cooperation with
Smad1 (601595)/Smad4 (600993) and Cebp-alpha (CEBPA; 116897), Shn2
induced the expression of Ppar-gamma-2 (PPARG; 601487), a key
transcription factor for adipocyte differentiation. Shn2 directly
interacted with both Smad1/Smad4 and Cebpa on the Pparg2 promoter. Jin
et al. (2006) concluded that Shn2-mediated BMP signaling is critical for
adipogenesis.

Using yeast 2-hybrid and coimmunoprecipitation assays, Shukla et al.
(2009) showed that Clic4 (606536) and Schnurri-2 interacted in cultured
mouse keratinocytes. TGF-beta (TGFB1; 190180) induced association
between cytoplasmic Clic4 and Schnurri-2, leading to their translocation
to the nucleus. Knockdown of Clic4 or Schnurri-2 abrogated
TGF-beta-induced growth inhibition. Nuclear Clic4 associated with
phosphorylated Smad2 (601366) and Smad3 (603109) and protected them from
dephosphorylation by nuclear protein phosphatase-1a (PPM1A; 606108).
Direct targeting of Clic4 to the nucleus following Schnurri-2 depletion
revealed that Schnurri-2 was required for Clic4 nuclear translocation,
but not for Clic4-mediated inhibition of DNA synthesis or growth
inhibition.

In mice, Staton et al. (2011) showed that repression of T-cell antigen
receptor-induced (TCR) death pathways is critical for proper
interpretation of positive selecting signals in vivo, and identified
Schnurri-2 as a crucial death dampener. Staton et al. (2011) showed that
Schnurri-2 null double-positive thymocytes inappropriately undergo
negative selection in response to positive selecting signals, thus
leading to disrupted T-cell development. Schnurri-2 null double-positive
thymocytes are more sensitive to TCR-induced death in vitro and die in
response to positive selection interactions in vivo. However,
Schnurri-2-deficient thymocytes can be positively selected when
TCR-induced death is genetically ablated. Shn2 levels increase after TCR
stimulation, indicating that integration of multiple TCR-MHC-peptide
interactions may fine-tune the death threshold. Mechanistically,
Schnurri-2 functions downstream of TCR proximal signaling components to
dampen Bax (600040) activation and the mitochondrial death pathway.
Staton et al. (2011) concluded that their findings uncover a critical
regulator of T-cell development that controls the balance between death
and differentiation.

MAPPING

Using Southern analysis of human/rodent somatic cell hybrid DNA with a
specific HIVEP2 cDNA probe, Sudo et al. (1992) assigned the gene to
chromosome 6 and further localized it to 6q23-q24 by fluorescence in
situ hybridization.

ANIMAL MODEL

Jin et al. (2006) found that Shn2 -/- mice were slightly smaller than
wildtype mice postnatally and at 9 weeks of age. The fat mass in Shn2
-/- mice was markedly reduced compared to wildtype mice. Other tissues,
including liver, heart, and kidney, had weights similar to wildtype
controls, and there were no gross abnormalities. There was no
significant difference in brown adipose tissue between Shn2 -/- and
wildtype mice. In culture, Shn2 -/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts did not
efficiently differentiate into adipocytes.

Jones et al. (2010) stated that Shn2 -/- mice display a modest
low-turnover osteopenia due to reduced osteoclast and osteoblast
function, whereas Shn3 (HIVEP3; 606649) -/- mice show severe
osteosclerosis due to increased osteoblast activity and elevated rate of
bone formation. Jones et al. (2010) found that Shn2 -/- Shn3 -/-
double-knockout mice displayed severe growth retardation resulting in
dwarfism and did not survive beyond 3 weeks of age. Shn2 -/- Shn3 -/-
skeletal defects were due to shortening of both axial and appendicular
skeletons, incomplete formation of thoracic vertebrae, impaired sternum
development, and shortening of proximal and distal limb bones. Increased
bone mass in Shn2 -/- Shn3 -/- mice was similar to that observed in Shn3
-/- mice and was due to elevated osteoblast activity. Complete ablation
of both Shn2 and Shn3 was necessary to perturb growth plate maturation,
whereas deletion of a single Shn3 allele was sufficient to cause
increased bone mass, which could be augmented by deletion of an Shn2
allele.

;;CREBBP-ASSOCIATED FACTOR; CAF;;
p300/CBP-ASSOCIATED FACTOR; PCAF;;
P/CAF
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

CBP (600140) and p300 (602700) are large nuclear proteins that bind to
many sequence-specific factors involved in cell growth and/or
differentiation, including c-jun (see 165160) and the adenoviral
oncoprotein E1A. Based on its homology to yeast GCN5, which interacts
with yeast GCN4 (a counterpart of c-Jun), Yang et al. (1996) identified
a protein, designated P/CAF, that associates with p300/CBP. P/CAF
encodes a predicted 832-amino acid protein that Yang et al. (1996)
showed by RNA blotting to be expressed in all tissues, most strongly in
heart and skeletal muscle. Yang et al. (1996) showed P/CAF to have in
vitro and in vivo binding activity with CBP and p300. P/CAF competes
with E1A for binding sites in p300/CBP. Yang et al. (1996) found that
P/CAF has histone acetyl transferase activity with core histones and
nucleosome core particles, which indicates that P/CAF plays a direct
role in transcriptional regulation.

GENE FUNCTION

Zhong et al. (1998) reported that the transcriptional activity of
NF-kappa-B is stimulated upon phosphorylation of its p65 subunit
(164014) on serine-276 by protein kinase A (PKA). The transcriptional
coactivator CBP/p300 associates with NF-kappa-B p65 through 2 sites, an
N-terminal domain that interacts with the C-terminal region of
unphosphorylated p65, and a second domain that only interacts with p65
phosphorylated on serine-276. Phosphorylation by PKA both weakens the
interaction between the N- and C-terminal regions of p65 and creates an
additional site for interaction with CBP/p300. Therefore, PKA regulates
the transcriptional activity of NF-kappa-B by modulating its interaction
with CBP/p300.

Sartorelli et al. (1999) showed that MYOD (159970) is directly
acetylated by PCAF at evolutionarily conserved lysines (positions 99,
102, and 104). Acetylated MYOD displayed an increased affinity for its
DNA target. Conservative substitutions of acetylated lysines with
nonacetylatable arginines impaired the ability of MYOD to stimulate
transcription and to induce conversion, indicating that acetylation of
MYOD is functionally critical.

To elucidate the molecular basis of assembling the multiprotein
activation complex, Demarest et al. (2002) undertook a structural and
thermodynamic analysis of the interaction domains of CBP and the
activator for thyroid hormone and retinoid receptors (TRAM1; 601937).
Demarest et al. (2002) demonstrated that although the isolated domains
are intrinsically disordered, they combine with high affinity to form a
cooperatively folded helical heterodimer. The authors concluded that
their study uncovers a unique mechanism, which they termed 'synergistic
folding,' through which p160 coactivators recruit CBP to allow
transmission of the hormone signal to the transcriptional machinery.

Okumura et al. (2006) showed that PCAF interacted physically and
functionally with PTEN (601728). PCAF acetylated PTEN on lys125 and
lys128 within the catalytic cleft essential for phosphoinositol
phosphate specificity, and this acetylation depended on the presence of
growth factors. Reduction of endogenous PCAF in human embryonic kidney
cells using short hairpin RNA resulted in loss of PTEN acetylation in
response to growth factors, and restored PTEN- mediated downregulation
of PI3K signaling and induction of G1 cell cycle arrest.
Acetylation-resistant PTEN mutants retained the ability to regulate PI3K
and induce cell cycle arrest following PCAF overexpression.

Triboulet et al. (2007) showed that suppression of the polycistronic
miRNA cluster miR17-92 (see 609416) by HIV-1, required for efficient
viral replication, was dependent on the histone acetyltransferase Tat
cofactor PCAF. The authors concluded that their results highlighted the
involvement of the miRNA silencing pathway in HIV-1 replication and
latency.

Xenaki et al. (2008) found that PCAF functioned as a cofactor for HIF1A
(603348) in human osteosarcoma cell lines treated with desferrioxamine
(DSFX), a hypoxia-mimicking compound. PCAF and HIF1A interacted in
DSFX-treated cells, resulting in PCAF-dependent acetylation of HIF1A.
PCAF was recruited to the hypoxia response element of a subset of HIF1A
targets, including the proapoptotic gene BID (601997) and the angiogenic
gene VEGF (192240). DSFX-treated cells also showed HIF1A-dependent
apoptosis. DSFX treatment also reduced PCAF-dependent acetylation of the
tumor suppressor p53 (TP53; 191170), which directed p53 toward induction
of the cell cycle regulator p21 (CDKN1A; 116899) and away from
proapoptotic p53 targets. Xenaki et al. (2008) concluded that PCAF
functions as a coordinating factor in the regulation of HIF1A-mediated
apoptosis and p53-dependent cell cycle progression.

Using mass spectrometry to identify subunits of the SPT3 (SUPT3H;
602947)-TAF9 (600822)-GCN5 (KAT2A; 602301)/PCAF acetylase (STAGA) and
ADA2A (TADA2A; 602276)-containing (ATAC) histone acetyltransferase
complexes in HeLa cells, Wang et al. (2008) showed that both complexes
could incorporate either GCN5 or PCAF as acetyltransferase. Both
complexes shared the common subunits ADA3 (TADA3; 602945) and STAF36
(CCDC101; 613374), but differed by the inclusion of several subunits,
including ADA2B (TADA2B; 608790) in STAGA and ADA2A and the scaffolding
protein YEATS2 (613373) in ATAC. Human ATAC and STAGA specifically
acetylated nucleosomal histone H3 (see 602812), and ATAC repressed
transcription of a reporter gene in a dose-dependent manner. Wang et al.
(2008) concluded that STAGA and ATAC complexes link extracellular
signals to modification of chromatin structure and regulation of the
basal transcriptional machinery.

MAPPING

Hartz (2009) mapped the KAT2B gene to chromosome 3p24.3 based on an
alignment of the KAT2B sequence (GenBank GENBANK U57317) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

By linkage analysis with an interspecific backcross panel, Xu et al.
(1998) mapped the mouse Pcaf gene to the centromeric region of
chromosome 17.

601430	TITLE *601430 UPF1, YEAST, HOMOLOG OF; UPF1
;;HUPF1;;
REGULATOR OF NONSENSE TRANSCRIPTS 1; RENT1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

UPF1 is a helicase that shows RNA-dependent ATPase and
5-prime-to-3-prime RNA helicase activities. The ATPase activity of UPF1
is critical to the nonsense-mediated RNA decay (NMD) pathway, which
targets mRNAs with premature termination codons for rapid degradation
(summary by Franks et al., 2010).

CLONING

Perlick et al. (1996) noted that at least 3 transacting factors (Upf1-3)
are required for NMD in yeast. They identified a human cDNA encoding a
protein with strong homology to Upf1 that they termed RENT1. Although
divergence exists at the extreme N and C termini of the human and yeast
polypeptides, the large central region of the protein shows 58% residue
identity and 80% conservation. Perlick et al. (1996) stated that RENT1
is the first identified mammalian protein that contains all of the
putative functional elements found in Upf1, including zinc finger-like
nucleotide-binding domains and all the motifs common to members of
helicase superfamily I. By cloning of the mouse gene and subsequent
alignment of the sequences for all related helicases, Perlick et al.
(1996) demonstrated that RENT1, Upf1, Mov10, and Sen1 define a distinct
subset within the superfamily. As expected for an essential component of
the apparently ubiquitous NMD pathway, RENT1 was detected in all tissues
tested.

Independently, Applequist et al. (1997) isolated cDNAs encoding RENT1,
which they named HUPF1 (human Upf1 protein). They stated that HUPF1
encodes a predicted 1,118-amino acid protein. Western blot analysis of
human cell extracts showed that HUPF1 migrated as a 130-kD protein.
Using immunofluorescence, Applequist et al. (1997) found that human and
mouse HUPF1, like yeast Upf1, localized in the cytoplasm but not in the
nucleus. Northern blot analysis detected a predominant 5.5-kb HUPF1 mRNA
and a minor 3.7-kb HUPF1 mRNA in various human cell lines.

GENE FUNCTION

Perlick et al. (1996) found that expression of a chimeric protein
containing the central region of human RENT1 flanked by the extreme N
and C termini of yeast Upf1 complemented the Upf1-deficient growth
phenotype in yeast. These data demonstrated that RENT1 is a mammalian
ortholog of Upf1.

Sun et al. (1998) provided evidence for a factor that functions to
eliminate the production of nonsense-containing RNAs in mammalian cells.
They identified the factor, variously referred to as RENT1 and HUPF1, by
isolating cDNA for a human homolog of S. cerevisiae Upf1p, which is a
group I RNA helicase that functions in the nonsense-mediated decay of
mRNA in yeast. Using monkey COS cells and human HeLa cells, Sun et al.
(1998) demonstrated that expression of human Upf1 protein harboring an
arginine-to-cysteine mutation at residue 844 within the RNA helicase
domain acts in a dominant-negative fashion to abrogate the decay of
nonsense-containing mRNA that takes place in association with nuclei or
in the cytoplasm. These findings provided evidence that
nonsense-mediated mRNA decay is related mechanistically in yeast and in
mammalian cells, regardless of the cellular site of decay.

Mendell et al. (2002) assessed the role of factors essential for NMD in
nonsense-mediated altered splicing (NAS) with the use of RNA
interference in mammalian cells. Inhibition of RENT1 expression
abrogated both NMD and NAS of nonsense T-cell receptor beta (TCRB; see
186930) transcripts. In contrast, inhibition of RENT2 (UPF2; 605529)
expression did not disrupt NAS despite achieving comparable
stabilization of nonsense transcripts. Mendell et al. (2002) also
demonstrated that NAS and NMD are genetically separable functions of
RENT1. Mendell et al. (2002) demonstrated that RENT1 enters the nucleus,
where it may directly influence early events in mRNA biogenesis. Mendell
et al. (2002) concluded that their results provide compelling evidence
that NAS relies on a component of the nonsense surveillance machinery
but is not an indirect consequence of NMD.

Using immunoprecipitation and immunodepletion experiments, Ohnishi et
al. (2003) showed that SMG5 (610962) and SMG7 (610964) associated with a
hyperphosphorylated form of UPF1, and that SMG5 was involved in UPF1
dephosphorylation by the protein phosphatase-2A (PP2A; see 176915)
complex. SMG5 mutants that interfered with UPF1 dephosphorylation also
inhibited nonsense-mediated mRNA decay in a dominant-negative manner.

Amrani et al. (2004) used a primer extension inhibition (toeprinting)
assay to delineate ribosome positioning and found that premature
translation termination in yeast extracts is indeed aberrant. Ribosomes
encountering premature UAA or UGA codons in the Can1 mRNA failed to
release and, instead, migrated to upstream AUGs. This anomaly depended
upon prior nonsense codon recognition and was eliminated in extracts
derived from cells lacking the principal NMD factor Upf1p, or by
flanking the nonsense codon with a normal 3-prime untranslated region
(UTR). Tethered poly(A)-binding protein (Pab1p), used as a mimic of a
normal 3-prime UTR, recruited the termination factor Sup35p (eRF3) and
stabilized nonsense-containing mRNAs. Amrani et al. (2004) concluded
that efficient termination and mRNA stability are dependent on a
properly configured 3-prime UTR.

Staufen-1 (STAU1; 601716) is an RNA-binding protein that is thought to
function in mRNA transport and translational control. Kim et al. (2005)
described an mRNA decay mechanism involving STAU1, UPF1, and a
termination codon. Unlike nonsense-mediated decay, this mechanism did
not involve pre-mRNA splicing and occurred when UPF2 or UPF3X (UPF3B;
300298) was downregulated. STAU1 bound directly to UPF1 and elicited
mRNA decay when tethered downstream of a termination codon. STAU1 also
interacted with the 3-prime UTR of ADP-ribosylation factor-1 (ARF1;
103180) mRNA. Accordingly, downregulation of either STAU1 or UPF1
increased ARF1 mRNA stability. These findings suggested that ARF1 mRNA
is a natural target for STAU1-mediated decay, and data indicated that
other mRNAs are also natural targets.

In crosslinking and coimmunoprecipitation experiments on HeLa cell
nuclear extracts, Agranat et al. (2008) showed that ADAR1 (146920)
associated with the RNA surveillance protein HUPF1 in the
supraspliceosome, a 21-megadalton nuclear ribonucleoprotein complex. The
interaction did not depend on RNA. Knockdown of ADAR1 with small
interfering RNA upregulated the expression of 4 of 6 genes that undergo
both A-to-I editing by ADARs and degradation via HUPF1.

Cellular mRNAs exist as messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) complexes
containing the mRNA and associated proteins. Franks et al. (2010) found
that small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of UPF1 in HeLa cells or
expression of an ATPase-deficient UPF1 mutant caused accumulation of an
NMD mRNP in cytoplasmic processing bodies. In the absence of UPF1 ATPase
activity, the NMD factors SMG5, SMG6 (610963), and SMG7 colocalized with
a partially degraded 3-prime mRNA intermediate in cytoplasmic processing
bodies. ATPase-deficient UPF1 copurified with multiple NMD factors,
including XRN1 (607994) and PABPC1 (604679), in addition to SMG5, SMG6,
and SMG7, and with exon junction complex components (see 608546). Franks
et al. (2010) concluded that UPF1 ATPase activity is required for
disassembly of mRNP complexes, and that disassembly of these complexes
is required for degradation of mRNA by XRN1.

MAPPING

Perlick et al. (1996) mapped the mouse Rent1 gene to mouse chromosome 8
by analysis of the Jackson Laboratory BSS backcross DNA panel. The
region of mouse chromosome 8 was known to have homology of synteny to
19p13.2-p13.11; the human probe detected human chromosome 19-specific
restriction fragments within the NIGMS human/rodent somatic cell hybrid
panel. Perlick et al. (1996) noted that although tumorigenic or
accelerated aging phenotypes might be predicted to result from the
somatic accumulation of nonsense or frameshift mutations on an
NMD-deficient background, no apparently relevant phenotypes have been
linked to the map positions for the murine or human genes on syntenic
regions of chromosomes 8 and 19p13.2-p13.11, respectively.

ANIMAL MODEL

Medghalchi et al. (2001) explored the consequences of loss of NMD
function in vertebrates through targeted disruption of the Rent1 gene,
which encodes a mammalian ortholog of Upf1p, in murine embryonic stem
cells. Mice heterozygous for the targeted allele showed no apparent
phenotypic abnormalities but homozygosity was never observed,
demonstrating that Rent1 is essential for embryonic viability.
Homozygous targeted embryos showed complete loss of NMD and were viable
in the preimplantation period, but resorbed shortly after implantation.
Furthermore, Rent1 -/- blastocysts isolated at 3.5 days postcoitum
underwent apoptosis in culture following a brief phase of cellular
expansion. The authors hypothesized that NMD is essential for mammalian
cellular viability and supports a critical role for the pathway in the
regulated expression of selected physiologic transcripts.

;;CST8L
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using subtractive hybridization to identify genes expressed in Macaca
mulatta epididymis, Hamil et al. (2002) identified a novel member of the
cystatin type 2 family of competitive reversible cysteine protease
inhibitors, which they called cystatin 11. By database searching, Hamil
et al. (2002) also identified a human homolog of CST11. An additional
CST11 cDNA, missing exon 2, was amplified by PCR from a human
caput/corpus library, indicating the presence of an alternatively
spliced mRNA. Northern blot analysis of multiple M. mulatta tissues
detected abundant expression of an 0.8-kb CST11 mRNA in all 3 regions of
the epididymis but not in any other tissues tested. Imunnohistochemical
staining of human epididymis localized the CST11 protein in epithelial
cell cytoplasm and nuclei and in the lumen throughout the epididymis.
Immuonofluorescence studies showed that CST11 is also found on
ejaculated human sperm, where it is localized to the postacrosomal and
tail regions.

GENE FUNCTION

Hamil et al. (2002) found that a 3-dimensional model of CST11, based on
x-ray crystallography data for chicken CST, suggested that the 3 regions
corresponding to the protease inhibitory wedge of cystatin-3 (CST3;
604312) are similarly juxtaposed in CST11, consistent with protease
inhibitory function.

Using Northern blot analysis to study the level of CST11 mRNA in M.
Mulatta epididymis after castration and with or without androgen
replacement, Hamil et al. (2002) found that expression of CST11 is
dependent on testosterone. Consistent with this result, they showed that
the putative CST11 promoter contains a potential androgen response
element and at least 2 half sites.

Hamil et al. (2002) demonstrated that a 2-hour incubation of E. coli
with recombinant CST11 or exon 2-deleted CST11 protein resulted in a 30%
loss of colony-forming units, indicating that both forms have
antimicrobial activity.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Hamil et al. (2002) mapped the CST11 gene to
chromosome 20p11.21 near 3 other CST genes that are predominantly
expressed in the male reproductive tract.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hamil et al. (2002) demonstrated that the structure of CST11 is well
conserved with other CST2 family genes, having 3 exons and 2 identically
positioned introns.

;;WOLF-HIRSCHHORN SYNDROME CANDIDATE 1;;
NUCLEAR SET DOMAIN-CONTAINING 2; NSD2;;
MULTIPLE MYELOMA SET DOMAIN; MMSET
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome (WHS; 194190) is a malformation syndrome
associated with a hemizygous deletion of the distal short arm of
chromosome 4 (4p16.3). The shortest region of overlap of the deletions
observed in WHS patients, the WHS critical region, has been confined to
a region of 165 kb (Wright et al., 1997). This region was sequenced
completely during the search for the Huntington disease gene (Baxendale
et al., 1993). Stec et al. (1998) described a novel developmental gene,
two-thirds of which maps in the distal part of the WHS critical region.
They designated the gene WHSC1 (Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome candidate-1).
The WHSC1 gene was identified initially through its high similarity to
the translation product of an expressed sequence tag, located in the
165-kb WHCR, with the SET domain (see 600960) of the Drosophila protein
ASH1 (607999). The SET domain is found in proteins that are involved in
embryonic development. The WHSC1 gene was found to be expressed
ubiquitously in early development and to undergo complex alternative
splicing and differential polyadenylation. It encodes a 136-kD protein
containing 4 domains present in other developmental proteins: a PWWP
domain, an HMG box, a SET domain also found in the Drosophila dysmorphy
gene ash-encoded protein, and a PHD-type zinc finger. It is expressed
preferentially in rapidly growing embryonic tissues, in a pattern
corresponding to affected organs in WHS patients. The nature of the
protein motifs, the expression pattern, and its mapping to the critical
region led Stec et al. (1998) to propose WHSC1 as a good candidate gene
to be responsible for many of the phenotypic features of WHS.

GENE FUNCTION

Nimura et al. (2009) showed that the H3K36me3-specific histone
methyltransferase Whsc1 functions in transcriptional regulation together
with developmental transcription factors whose defects overlap with the
human disease Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome (WHS). Nimura et al. (2009) found
that mouse Whsc1, 1 of 5 putative Set2 homologs, governed H3K36me3 along
euchromatin by associating with the cell type-specific transcription
factors Sall1 (602218), Sall4 (607343), and Nanog (607937) in embryonic
stem cells, and Nkx2-5 (600584) in embryonic hearts, regulating the
expression of their target genes. Whsc1-deficient mice showed growth
retardation and various WHS-like midline defects, including congenital
cardiovascular anomalies. The effects of Whsc1 haploinsufficiency were
increased in Nkx2-5 heterozygous mutant hearts, indicating their
functional link. Nimura et al. (2009) proposed that WHSC1 functions
together with developmental transcription factors to prevent the
inappropriate transcription that can lead to various pathophysiologies.

Pei et al. (2011) found that H4K20 methylation actually increases
locally upon the induction of double-strand breaks and that methylation
of H4K20 at double-strand breaks is mediated by the histone
methyltransferase MMSET in mammals. Downregulation of MMSET
significantly decreases H4K20 methylation at double-strand breaks and
the subsequent accumulation of 53BP1 (605230). Furthermore, Pei et al.
(2011) found that the recruitment of MMSET to double-strand breaks
requires the gamma-H2AX (601772)-MDC1 (607593) pathway; specifically,
the interaction between the MDC1 BRCT domain and phosphorylated ser102
of MMSET. Thus, Pei et al. (2011) proposed that a pathway involving
gamma-H2AX-MDC1-MMSET regulates the induction of H4K20 methylation on
histones around double-strand breaks, which, in turn, facilitates 53BP1
recruitment.

GENE STRUCTURE

The WHSC1 gene contains 25 exons (Stec et al., 1998).

MAPPING

Stec et al. (1998) mapped the WHSC1 gene to chromosome 4p16.3 based on
genomic sequence analysis.

CYTOGENETICS

Stec et al. (1998) noted that the t(4;14)(p16.3;q32.3) translocations
described in a significant fraction of multiple myelomas (Richelda et
al., 1997; Chesi et al., 1997) have breakpoints located less than 100 kb
centromeric of the FGFR3 gene (134934) on 4p16.3. They found that at
least 3 of the breakpoints merged the immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene
(IGHG1; 147100) on chromosome 14 with the WHSC1 gene. This fusion of
genes and their untimely expression in the myeloid lineage driven from
the 5-prime IgH enhancer may indicate that WHSC1-encoded proteins are
involved in the clinical heterogeneity of multiple myeloma.
