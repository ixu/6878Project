DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the F-box protein family, such as FBXO17, are characterized
by an approximately 40-amino acid F-box motif. SCF complexes, formed by
SKP1 (601434), cullin (see CUL1; 603134), and F-box proteins, act as
protein-ubiquitin ligases. F-box proteins interact with SKP1 through the
F box, and they interact with ubiquitination targets through other
protein interaction domains (Jin et al., 2004).

CLONING

Using SKP1 as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen, and by searching EST
databases, Winston et al. (1999) identified several genes encoding F-box
proteins, including mouse Fbx17. The deduced protein contains an
N-terminal F box, followed by an F box-associated domain.

By searching EST databases using F box consensus sequences, followed by
PCR of a kidney cDNA library, Ilyin et al. (2002) obtained a full-length
cDNA encoding FBXO17, which they designated FBG4. The deduced protein
contains 278 amino acids. Northern blot analysis detected a 2.4-kb
transcript highly expressed in kidney. Lower expression was detected in
liver, and little to no expression was detected in all other tissues
examined.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ilyin et al. (2002) determined that the FBXO17 gene contains 6 exons and
spans about 34.3 kb. Exon 1 is untranslated.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Ilyin et al. (2002) mapped the FBXO17 gene
to chromosome 19q13, near the FBXO27 gene (609099). Jin et al. (2004)
stated that the FBXO17 gene maps to chromosome 19q13.2 and the mouse
Fbxo17 gene maps to chromosome 7A3.

608788	TITLE *608788 SUPPRESSOR OF CYTOKINE SIGNALING 7; SOCS7
;;NCK-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 4; NAP4;;
NCK-, ASH-, AND PLCG-BINDING PROTEIN 4
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis of a fetal brain cDNA library using the SH3
domain of NCK (600508) as bait, Matuoka et al. (1997) obtained a partial
cDNA of SOCS7, which they called NAP4. The longest open reading frame
encodes a predicted 485-amino acid protein containing several pro-rich
sequences, a putative nuclear localization signal, a pro- and gln-rich
region characteristic of nuclear proteins, and an SH2 domain. The third
pro-rich region of NAP4 was the only region that bound NCK in the yeast
2-hybrid analysis. Northern blot analysis detected a 4.2-kb NAP4
transcript in fetal brain and fetal lung fibroblasts. An 8.3-kb
transcript was also detected in fetal lung fibroblasts. RT-PCR showed
NAP4 expression in leukocytes and adult brain.

By in situ hybridization, Krebs et al. (2004) found mouse Socs7
expressed at high levels in the nervous system at embryonic day 12.5 and
in the cortical plate at embryonic day 15.5. Low levels were detected in
all other organ systems examined.

GENE FUNCTION

By coimmunoprecipitation analysis, Matuoka et al. (1997) showed that
NAP4 bound NCK, ASH (GRB2; 108355), and phospholipase C-gamma (PLCG; see
172420). They also found that the SH2 domain of NAP4 bound activated and
tyrosine-phosphorylated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR; 131550).

Banks et al. (2005) performed insulin tolerance and glucose tolerance
testing in mixed background Socs7-null mice and observed lower glucose
levels and prolonged hypoglycemia, and increased glucose clearance,
respectively, compared to wildtype mice. Socs7-null cells had increased
Irs1 (147545) protein levels and enhanced insulin action as demonstrated
by increased adipocyte differentiation. In HEK293 cells, SOCS7
coimmunoprecipitated with IRS1 and INSR (147670). Banks et al. (2005)
concluded that SOCS7 is a potent regulator of glucose homeostasis and
insulin signaling.

Kremer et al. (2007) showed that knockdown of SEPT2 (601506), SEPT6
(300683), and SEPT7 (603151) in HeLa cells caused actin stress fibers to
disintegrate and cells to lose polarity. They found that these septins
acted through SOCS7 to restrict nuclear accumulation of NCK. In the
absence of septin filaments, SOCS7 recruited NCK into the nucleus.
Moreover, depletion of NCK from the cytoplasm triggered dissolution of
actin stress fibers and loss of cell polarity. Kremer et al. (2007) also
showed that the association between septins, SOCS7, and NCK played a
role in the DNA damage checkpoint response. NCK entered the nucleus
following DNA damage and was required for ultraviolet (UV)-induced cell
cycle arrest. Furthermore, nuclear NCK was essential for activation of
p53 (TP53; 191170) in response to UV-induced DNA damage. Kremer et al.
(2007) concluded that septins, SOCS7, and NCK are part of a signaling
pathway that couples regulation of the DNA damage response to the
cytoskeleton.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the SOCS7
gene to chromosome 17 (TMAP WI-21045).

ANIMAL MODEL

Krebs et al. (2004) found that Socs7-null mice were born at normal
mendelian ratios, were fertile, and did not exhibit alterations in serum
biochemistry or gross organ morphology, but they were 7 to 10% smaller
than control littermates. Between 3 to 15 weeks of age, however, about
half of the Socs7-null mice developed fatal hydrocephalus characterized
by cranial distortion, dilation of the ventricular system, reduced
thickness of the cerebral cortex, and disorganization of the
subcommissural organ. Hydrocephalus associated with morbidity and
mortality was observed with only 40 to 60% incidence in Socs7-null mice,
suggesting that the mutant phenotype occurs with incomplete penetrance.
Banks et al. (2005) generated Socs7-null mice on a C57BL/6J background
that had the same phenotypic features noted by Krebs et al. (2004).
However, mixed background Socs7-null mice were identical in length,
weight, and body composition to wildtype littermates at up to 6 months
of age.

;;CORONIN-LIKE PROTEIN B; CLIPINB;;
WD REPEAT-CONTAINING PROTEIN 2; WDR2;;
IR10
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By screening a human epidermal cDNA library with products identified
through CpG island rescue PCR methodology, Zaphiropoulos and Toftgard
(1996) isolated a CORO2A clone, which they called IR10. IR10 encodes a
deduced 525-amino acid polypeptide with homology to several
actin-binding proteins. The IR10 sequence contains 5 WD repeats. The
IR10 gene is expressed as a 5-kb message in brain and several other
human tissues, and as a 2-kb message in epidermis.

GENE STRUCTURE

The IR10 gene contains of 2 putative exons (Zaphiropoulos and Toftgard,
1996).

GENE FUNCTION

Huang et al. (2011) provided evidence that CORO2A mediates Toll-like
receptor (TLR; e.g., see 603029)-induced NCoR (600849) turnover by a
mechanism involving interaction with oligomeric nuclear actin.
SUMOylated liver X receptors (LXRs) block NCoR turnover by binding to a
conserved SUMO2 (603042)/SUMO3 (602231)-interaction motif in CORO2A and
preventing actin recruitment. Intriguingly, the LXR transrepression
pathway can itself be inactivated by inflammatory signals that induce
calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II-gamma (CAMK2G;
602123)-dependent phosphorylation of LXRs, leading to their
deSUMOylation by the SUMO protease SENP3 (612844) and release from
CORO2A. Huang et al. (2011) concluded that their findings uncovered a
CORO2A-actin-dependent mechanism for the derepression of inflammatory
response genes that can be differentially regulated by phosphorylation
and by nuclear receptor signaling pathways that control immunity and
homeostasis.

MAPPING

Zaphiropoulos and Toftgard (1996) identified the IR10 gene on chromosome
9q22.3.

603639	TITLE *603639 A DISINTEGRIN AND METALLOPROTEINASE DOMAIN 17; ADAM17
;;TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR-ALPHA CONVERTING ENZYME; TACE
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Black et al. (1997) cloned a human cDNA encoding ADAM17, which they
called TACE. The gene encodes an 824-amino acid polypeptide containing
the features of the ADAM family: a secretory signal sequence, a
disintegrin domain, and a metalloprotease domain. Expression studies
showed that the encoded protein cleaves precursor tumor necrosis
factor-alpha (TNFA; 191160) to its mature form. Northern blot analysis
revealed that the gene was expressed as a 5-kb mRNA in all tissues
examined. Black et al. (1997) generated mouse T cells with a homozygous
deficiency in the TACE gene; these cells showed an 80 to 90% reduction
in the release of TNFA.

By screening human leukocyte and monocyte cDNA libraries with DNA
fragments from porcine Tace clones, Moss et al. (1997) obtained cDNAs
encoding human TACE. Immunoblot analysis showed that TACE is expressed
as a 70-kD enzyme that processes TNFA between ala76 and val77 to
generate the mature form. Sequence analysis predicted that the
proline-rich cytoplasmic tail of TACE has a tyrosine phosphorylation
site with the potential to bind the SH3 domain.

By differential display RT-PCR between normal and
osteoarthritic-affected cartilage, Patel et al. (1998) obtained a
full-length cDNA encoding TACE. The deduced transmembrane TACE protein
contains a cysteine switch-like region, a catalytic region, a
zinc-binding region, and an EGF-like region in addition to the motifs
described by Black et al. (1997) and Moss et al. (1997). RT-PCR analysis
detected upregulated expression of TACE and TNFA in both rheumatoid- and
osteoarthritis-affected cartilage, but not in normal cartilage.

MAPPING

Yamazaki et al. (1998) used PCR of a backcross panel to map the mouse
Tace gene to the proximal arm of chromosome 12. Hirohata et al. (1998)
used radiation hybrids to map ADAM17 to human chromosome 2p25.

GENE FUNCTION

Brou et al. (2000) purified the gamma-secretase-like activity that
accounts for the S2 cleavage of NOTCH1 (190198) in vitro and showed that
it is due to TACE. Furthermore, experiments on TACE -/- bone
marrow-derived monocytic precursor cells suggested that TACE plays a
prominent role in the activation of the Notch pathway.

Using a yeast 2-hybrid analysis with the cytoplasmic tails of several
ADAM proteins as bait, Nelson et al. (1999) found that MAD2L1 (601467)
interacts strongly with TACE but not with ADAM9 (602713), which
interacts with MAD2L2 (604094), or with other ADAMs tested. Further
binding analyses defined a 35-amino acid stretch of TACE containing a
proline-rich SH3-ligand domain (PXPXXP) as the interaction site for
MAD2L1.

Using mouse and human cells and DNA constructs, Garton et al. (2001)
provided evidence that TACE is the protease responsible for phorbol
ester-stimulated release of membrane-bound fractalkine (CX3CL1; 601880)
from the surface of endothelial cells and fibroblasts. TACE was not
required for constitutive fractalkine shedding. Fractalkine cleavage did
not rely on a specific TACE-sensitive amino acid sequence, but showed
relaxed sequence specificity and apparent recognition by TACE of the
structure of the juxtamembrane stalk region of membrane-bound
fractalkine.

Mohan et al. (2002) examined the cleavage of TNFA by native and
recombinant ADAM17. In contrast to the more broad specificity reported
by others, they found that ADAM17 showed strict specificity for the TNFA
cleavage site sequence. They also found that ADAM17 was 100- to
1,000-fold more efficient in TNFA processing than several matrix
metalloproteinases.

By transfecting double-stranded RNA corresponding to several ADAMs, Asai
et al. (2003) determined that the alpha-secretase activity displayed by
a human glioblastoma cell line toward amyloid precursor protein (APP;
104760) was catalyzed by the combined activity of ADAM9, ADAM10
(602192), and ADAM17.

Chen et al. (2007) found that ADAM10 and ADAM17 mediated shedding of
Klotho (KL; 604824) from cell membranes of Klotho-transfected COS-7
cells, a model system they validated by studies in rat kidney slices.
Insulin enhanced Klotho shedding, and this effect was abolished by
silencing of ADAM10 or ADAM17. Insulin appeared to stimulate ADAM10 and
ADAM17 proteolytic activity toward Klotho, but did not increase their
mRNA or protein levels.

Using immunoprecipitation analysis, Adrain et al. (2012) showed that
mouse iRhom2 (RHBDF2; 614404) interacted with mouse Tace in mouse
macrophages and transfected human cells. They observed near abolition of
serum Tnf in iRhom2 -/- mice and iRhom2 -/- macrophages injected or
stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), respectively. FACS and
immunoblot analyses showed increased expression of full-length Tnf on
the surface of iRhom2 -/- cells. Inhibition of Tace in wildtype cells
produced a similar phenotype. Lack of iRhom2 in macrophages did not
affect expression of Tace, but it abolished its activity and interfered
with its intracellular trafficking from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).
In iRhom2 -/- cells, Tace became resistant to endoglycosidase H and
furin (FUR; 136950) cleavage and failed to reach the trans-Golgi network
for activation. Knockdown of IRHOM2 via small interfering RNA in human
cells inhibited maturation of endogenous TACE, similar to findings in
iRhom2 -/- mice. Database analysis indicated that Tnf signaling
upregulates iRhom2 expression, suggesting a positive-feedback loop.
Adrain et al. (2012) concluded that IRHOM2 promotes trafficking and
activation of TACE.

Independently, McIlwain et al. (2012) found that overexpression of a
short isoform of mouse iRhom2 protected mouse L929 cells from
Tnf-induced apoptosis via metalloprotease-dependent release of Tnf
receptors from the cell surface. Immunoblot analysis showed that
full-length mouse iRhom2 associated with both the immature and active,
mature forms of Tace. iRhom2 -/- macrophages stimulated with LPS showed
upregulation of Tace and Tnf mRNA comparable to that in wildtype
macrophages. However, iRhom2 -/- macrophages exhibited increased surface
Tnf expression and significantly less secreted Tnf protein. Splenocytes
and bone marrow-derived macrophages from iRhom2 -/- mice exhibited only
immature, but not mature, Tace expression, and Tace was restricted to
granular vesicular compartments.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In an affected brother and sister from a consanguineous family of
Lebanese origin with neonatal inflammatory skin and bowel disease
(NISBD; 614328), Blaydon et al. (2011) performed SNP-homozygosity
mapping followed by targeted next-generation sequencing and identified
homozygosity for a 4-bp deletion in the ADAM17 gene (603639.0001).

ANIMAL MODEL

Peschon et al. (1998) found that mice lacking the zinc-binding domain of
Tace died in utero after embryonic day 17.5 or failed to survive beyond
1 week of age. The lethality was TNF-independent, since mice lacking
soluble TNF and its receptors were overtly normal. The eye, hair, and
skin phenotype of the mice lacking the zinc-binding domain of Tace
resembled that of soluble transforming growth factor-alpha (TGFA;
190170)-deficient mice. Radioimmunoassay analysis determined that
shedding of Tgfa from the cell membrane of cells lacking the Tace
zinc-binding domain was reduced 95%, suggesting an essential role for
soluble TGFA in normal development. In addition, Peschon et al. (1998)
found that Tace was essential for shedding of membrane-bound L-selectin
(SELL; 153240) and TNFRSF1B (191191), implying a broad range of
substrates for TACE.

Diwan et al. (2004) compared transgenic mice with targeted cardiac
overexpression of secreted wildtype Tnf to transgenic mice with targeted
cardiac overexpression of a noncleavable transmembrane form of Tnf. Both
lines of mice had overlapping levels of myocardial Tnf protein, but
developed strikingly different cardiac phenotypes: the mice
overexpressing the transmembrane form of Tnf developed concentric left
ventricular hypertrophy, whereas the mice overexpressing secreted Tnf
had dilated left ventricular hypertrophy. Diwan et al. (2004) suggested
that posttranslational processing of TNF by TACE, as opposed to TNF
expression per se, is responsible for the adverse cardiac remodeling
that occurs after sustained TNF overexpression.

Horiuchi et al. (2007) generated conditional Tace-deficient mice to
avoid early postnatal mortality observed in mice lacking Tace. They
found that either systemic or myeloid deletion of Tace at 6 weeks
offered strong protection from endotoxin shock lethality by preventing
increased Tnf serum levels. Horiuchi et al. (2007) concluded that Tace
is the major endotoxin-stimulated Tnf sheddase in mouse myeloid cells in
vivo and that TACE is a principal target for the treatment of
TNF-dependent pathologies, such as rheumatoid arthritis (180300), Crohn
disease (see 266600), and psoriasis (see 177900).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
INFLAMMATORY SKIN AND BOWEL DISEASE, NEONATAL
ADAM17, 4-BP DEL, 603CAGA

In an affected brother and sister from a consanguineous family of
Lebanese origin with neonatal inflammatory skin and bowel disease
(NISBD; 614328), Blaydon et al. (2011) identified a 4-bp deletion
(603delCAGA) in exon 5 of the ADAM17 gene, predicted to cause a
frameshift and premature termination with loss of the catalytic and
disintegrin domains, transmembrane segment, and cytosolic tail. The
unaffected parents were heterozygous for the mutation, which was not
found in the unaffected brother. Western blotting of both
peripheral-blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and keratinocyte lysates from
the affected boy showed an absence of ADAM17 expression. In addition,
patient PBMCs showed high levels of lipopolysaccharide-induced
production of interleukin-1-beta (IL1B; 147720) and interleukin-6 (IL6;
147620), but impaired release of TNF-alpha (191160).

142622	TITLE *142622 HIPPOCALCIN; HPCA
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Hippocalcin is a member of a family of neuron-specific Ca(2+)-binding
proteins found in the retina and brain.

CLONING

Hippocalcin is a 23-kD Ca(2+)-binding protein first identified in the
rat hippocampus (Kobayashi et al., 1992). The primary structure of rat
hippocalcin comprises 193 amino acid residues and shows striking
sequence similarities to proteins located in the photoreceptor cells
that regulate photosignal transduction in a Ca(2+)-sensitive manner.
Hippocalcin is associated with the plasma membrane. Takamatsu et al.
(1994) isolated a cDNA clone encoding human hippocalcin from a human
hippocampus cDNA library. The human sequence showed 100% amino acid
identity with the rat sequence and 92% nucleotide identity. Northern
blot analysis detected a single 2.0-kb HPCA transcript only in brain.

MAPPING

Takamatsu et al. (1994) mapped the HPCA gene to chromosome 1 by PCR
amplification of a human hippocalcin-specific DNA fragment on DNA from
human/rodent somatic cell hybrids.

603151	TITLE *603151 SEPTIN 7; SEPT7
;;CELL DIVISION CYCLE 10; CDC10
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The Saccharomyces cerevisiae CDC10 protein is a structural component of
the 10-nm filament which lies inside the cytoplasmic membrane and is
essential for budding. Nakatsuru et al. (1994) cloned a novel human gene
whose predicted 418-amino acid product shared 39% and 54% sequence
identity with yeast CDC10 and mouse H5 proteins, respectively. The human
CDC10 protein contains a conserved GTP-binding domain. Northern blot
analysis revealed a 2.4-kb mRNA that was expressed in all human tissues
tested.

GENE FUNCTION

Low and Macara (2006) noted that specific combinations of septins can
heterooligomerize and form filaments in vitro and in vivo. Using
fluorescence resonance energy transfer, size exclusion chromatography,
and multiangle light scattering analyses, they characterized the complex
formed by SEPT2 (601506), SEPT6 (300683), and SEPT7. SEPT6 and SEPT7
interacted through a parallel coiled-coil domain, and SEPT2 interacted
with SEPT6 through its C-terminal coiled-coil domain.

Kremer et al. (2007) showed that knockdown of SEPT2, SEPT6, and SEPT7 in
HeLa cells caused actin stress fibers to disintegrate and cells to lose
polarity. They found that these septins acted through SOCS7 (608788) to
restrict nuclear accumulation of NCK (NCK1; 600508). In the absence of
septin filaments, SOCS7 recruited NCK into the nucleus. Moreover,
depletion of NCK from the cytoplasm triggered dissolution of actin
stress fibers and loss of cell polarity. Kremer et al. (2007) also
showed that the association between septins, SOCS7, and NCK played a
role in the DNA damage checkpoint response. NCK entered the nucleus
following DNA damage and was required for ultraviolet (UV)-induced cell
cycle arrest. Furthermore, nuclear NCK was essential for activation of
p53 (TP53; 191170) in response to UV-induced DNA damage. Kremer et al.
(2007) concluded that septins, SOCS7, and NCK are part of a signaling
pathway that couples regulation of the DNA damage response to the
cytoskeleton.

Nagata et al. (2004) coprecipitated Sept11 (612887) with a septin
complex that included Sept2, Sept7, Sept8 (608418), and Sept9b (see
SEPT9, 604061) from a rat fibroblast cell line, and examined the
interaction of Sept11 with Sept7 and Sept9b. They found that the
C-terminal coiled-coil regions of Sept7 and Sept11 interact with each
other, and that these coiled-coil regions interact with the N-terminal
variable region of Sept9b. Sept7, Sept9b, and Sept11 formed thin
filaments when expressed alone in COS-7 cells. Coexpression of Sept11
with Sept7 disrupted the filaments formed by each component alone,
although Sept7 and Sept11 colocalized despite filament disruption.
Conversely, coexpression of Sept11 and Sept9b increased filament
bundling compared with filaments formed by each component alone. Nagata
et al. (2004) concluded that the filaments formed by individual septins
are affected by other septins in the filament complex.

Kim et al. (2010) identified control of septin localization by the
planar cell polarity (PCP) protein Fritz (613580) as a crucial control
point for both collective cell movement and ciliogenesis in Xenopus
embryos. Sept2 and Sept7 were expressed strongly in cells during
convergent extension, and morpholino-mediated knockdown of either
resulted in defective gastrulation. Cells in septin morphants displayed
reduced cell elongation but normal polarization, similar to Fritz
morphants. Data suggested that septins and Fritz collaborate during
PCP-mediated collective cell movements.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Sirajuddin et al. (2007) presented the crystal structures of the human
SEPT2 G domain and the heterotrimeric human SEPT2-SEPT6-SEPT7 complex.
This structure revealed a universal bipolar polymer building block,
composed of an extended G domain, which forms oligomers and filaments by
conserved interactions between adjacent nucleotide-binding sites and/or
the amino- and carboxy-terminal extensions. Unexpectedly, x-ray
crystallography and electron microscopy showed that the predicted coiled
coils are not involved in or required for complex and/or filament
formation. The asymmetrical heterotrimers associate head-to-head to form
a hexameric unit that is nonpolarized along the filament axis but is
rotationally asymmetrical. Sirajuddin et al. (2007) concluded that the
architecture of septin filaments differs fundamentally from that of
other cytoskeletal structures.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the SEPT7
gene to chromosome 7 (TMAP STS-S72008).

609450	TITLE *609450 MAX DIMERIZATION PROTEIN 3; MXD3
;;MAD3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Queva et al. (2001) found that adult mice expressed Mxd3 only in
proliferating areas of the thymus and testis. In the developing embryo,
Mxd3 RNA was detected from 9.5 to 12.5 days postcoitus, especially in
the ventricular zone of the neuroepithelia, in the progression zone of
the limb buds, and in the aortic arches and liver. In situ hybridization
and double labeling for BrdU incorporation suggested that Mxd3 was
expressed during the last S phase prior to terminal differentiation.

MAPPING

Hartz (2005) mapped the MXD3 gene to chromosome 5q35.3 based on an
alignment of the MXD3 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF114834) with the
genomic sequence.

ANIMAL MODEL

Queva et al. (2001) found that Mxd3-null mice were born at an expected
mendelian ratio, were viable and fertile, and showed no obvious
differences when compared with wildtype littermates. However, thymocytes
cultured from Mxd3-null mice were abnormally sensitive to gamma
irradiation, but not to any other apoptosis-inducing agents tested.
Gamma-irradiated embryos showed increased apoptosis in neural progenitor
cells at the periphery of the ventricular zone. These cells were found
to normally express Mxd3 and were in S phase of the cell cycle when
irradiated.

602180	TITLE *602180 SIGNAL-INDUCED PROLIFERATION-ASSOCIATED GENE 1; SIPA1
;;SPA1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Hattori et al. (1995) cloned the mouse Spa1 gene based on its inducible
expression in lymphoid cells stimulated with interleukin-2 (147680).

Kurachi et al. (1997) cloned the human SPA1 gene. The gene encodes a
1,042-amino acid polypeptide with a predicted mass of 130 kD. The
protein contains a C-terminal leucine zipper motif and an N-terminal
GTPase activating protein (GAP) domain homologous to the human RAP1GAP
(600278) protein. Human and mouse Spa1 amino acid sequences are 90%
identical, with their GAP domains 98% identical. Human SPA1 was
expressed at high levels in lymphohematopoietic tissues and at lower
levels in several other tissues. The authors noted that SPA1 and RAP1GAP
appeared to have nearly segregate expression patterns. The human SPA1
protein was localized to the perinuclear region.

GENE FUNCTION

Hattori et al. (1995) showed that mouse Spa1 hampers mitogen-induced
cell cycle progression when abnormally or prematurely expressed.

Kurachi et al. (1997) stated that SPA1 colocalized with the RAP1
(179520) and RAP2 (179540) proteins and activated these GTPases.

GENE STRUCTURE

Wada et al. (1997) cloned the mouse genomic Sipa1 gene and found that it
consists of 16 exons.

Ebrahimi et al. (1998) studied the organization of the human SIPA1 gene.

MAPPING

Wada et al. (1997) used fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to map
the human SIPA1 gene to chromosome 11q13.3. Using 2-color FISH, they
determined that the human SIPA1 locus is centromeric to the CCND1
(168461) locus.

ANIMAL MODEL

Hunter et al. (2001) identified a probable metastasis efficiency locus,
called Mtes1, on proximal mouse chromosome 19 (Hunter et al., 2001) in a
10-Mb region orthologous to human 11q12-q13. To identify potential
candidates for underlying Mtes1, Park et al. (2002) used multiple cross
and inbred strain haplotype mapping of the Mtes1 locus in 2 mouse
strains with high metastatic efficiency and 2 with low metastatic
efficiency, which reduced the number of high-priority candidate genes
from about 500 to 23, a more tractable number for further
characterization. Park et al. (2005), using a combination of
bioinformatics, sequence analysis, and in vitro and in vivo experiments,
identified the signal-induced proliferation-associated gene-1 (Sipa1) as
a strong candidate for underlying the Mtes1 locus. The gene was found to
contain a nonsynonymous amino acid polymorphism that affected its Sipa1
Rap-GAP function. Spontaneous metastasis assays using cells ectopically
expressing Sipa1 or cells with knocked-down Sipa1 expression showed that
metastatic capacity was correlated with cellular Sipa1 levels. They also
found that human expression data were consistent with the idea that
Sipa1 concentration has a role in metastasis. Park et al. (2005) stated
that, to their knowledge, this was the first demonstration of a
constitutional genetic polymorphism affecting tumor metastasis.

Ishida et al. (2006) found that Spa1 -/- mice had an age-dependent
increase in B220 (PTPRC; 151460)-expressing B1a lymphocytes producing
anti-double-stranded DNA antibody, an altered variable kappa isotype
repertoire, and lupus-like nephritis. Ishida et al. (2006) proposed that
regulated RAP1 signaling in immature B cells plays a role in modifying
the B-cell repertoire and in maintaining self-tolerance.

184420	TITLE *184420 FARNESYLDIPHOSPHATE FARNESYLTRANSFERASE 1; FDFT1
;;SQUALENE SYNTHASE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Farnesyldiphosphate farnesyltransferase (EC 2.5.1.21), or squalene
synthase, catalyzes the conversion of trans-farnesyldiphosphate to
squalene, the first specific step in the cholesterol biosynthetic
pathway (Shechter et al., 1994).

CLONING

Jiang et al. (1993) isolated a cDNA encoding human squalene synthase.

GENE STRUCTURE

Guan et al. (1995) cloned and characterized the promoter of the FDFT1
gene. A 69-bp sequence positioned 131 bp 5-prime to the transcription
start site conferred transcriptional competence and sterol regulation.
Sequence analysis of this region showed that it contains a sterol
regulatory element-1 (SRE1) previously identified in other
sterol-regulated genes and 2 potential NF1-binding sites.

MAPPING

To map the FDFT1 gene, Shechter et al. (1994) first isolated a yeast
artificial chromosome (YAC) containing the FDFT1 gene. They then used
fluorescence in situ hybridization with the YAC to map the gene to
chromosome 8. Assignment to chromosome 8 was confirmed by PCR analysis
of a somatic cell hybrid containing human chromosome 8. Use of a somatic
cell hybrid regional mapping panel dividing chromosome 8 into several
fragments localized the gene to chromosome 8pter-p21. Fractional length
analysis of the FISH mapping placed the signal generated with this YAC
at chromosome 8p23.1-p22.

GENE FUNCTION

Do et al. (2009) reviewed the role of squalene synthase in cholesterol
biosynthesis, including regulation of cellular and plasma cholesterol
levels, noting that it is responsible for the flow of metabolites into
either the sterol or nonsterol branch of the pathway.

CYTOGENETICS

In a study of the breakpoint at 8p23.1 associated with the inversion 8
chromosome found in at least 1 parent of all Rec(8) syndrome (179613)
individuals, Patterson et al. (1995) found that the clones contained at
least the 5-prime coding region of the FDFT1 gene, which they referred
to as DGPT.

ANIMAL MODEL

By positional cloning and genotyping in Shumiya cataract rats, Mori et
al. (2006) identified hypomorphic mutations in the Lss gene (600909) and
the Fdft1 gene, as well as a null mutation in Lss. Cataract onset was
associated with the specific combination of Lss and Fdft1 mutant alleles
that decreased cholesterol levels in cataractous lenses to about 57% of
normal. Mori et al. (2006) concluded that cholesterol insufficiency may
cause the deficient proliferation of lens epithelial cells in Shumiya
cataract rats, resulting in the loss of homeostatic epithelial cell
control of the underlying fiber cells and ultimately cataractogenesis.

611411	TITLE *611411 CALCIUM/CALMODULIN-DEPENDENT PROTEIN KINASE KINASE 1, ALPHA; CAMKK1
;;CAMKK-ALPHA; CAMKKA
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CAMKK1 catalyzes the phosphorylation and activation of Ca(2+)/calmodulin
kinase (CaMK) as an upstream component of the CaMK cascade that has been
implicated in neuronal gene transcription, synaptic plasticity, and
long-term memory consolidation (Blaeser et al., 2006).

CLONING

By screening a rat brain cDNA library using partial amino acid sequence
of a 68-kD purified rat brain CaMK kinase, followed by 5-prime RACE,
Tokumitsu et al. (1995) cloned rat Camkk1. The deduced 505-amino acid
protein has a calculated molecular mass of 56 kD. Camkk1 shares 30 to
40% amino acid identity over the catalytic domains of serine/threonine
kinases such as the CaM-kinase family (see CAMK2A; 114078). Camkk1
contains a 22-amino acid proline-, arginine-, and glycine-rich insert
between the ATP-binding motif and DGF kinase motif that is similar to
the insert in yeast Ste11. Northern blot analysis of rat tissues
detected high expression in forebrain, lower expression in cerebellum,
and detectable signal in thymus and spleen.

GENE FUNCTION

Using Western blot analysis or gel overlay, Tokumitsu et al. (1995)
showed that Camkk1 binds calmodulin (CALM1; 114180) and activated Camk4
(114080) with a 6-fold increase in total activity and a 100-fold
increase in Camk4 Ca(2+)-independent activity. Camkk1 catalyzed a
10-fold increase in the total activity of Camk1 (604998) and had no
effect on Camk2 (see CAMK2A; 114078). Cotransfection of COS-7 cells with
Camkk1 and Camk4 resulted in a 14-fold increase in CRE-binding protein
(CREB1; 123810)-dependent transcription compared with Camk4 alone,
suggesting that Camkk1 enhances Camk4-mediated transcriptional
regulation.

Using pharmacologic inhibitors to block potential pathways involved in
cytomegalovirus (CMV)-mediated activation of glycolysis, McArdle et al.
(2011) found that inhibition of CAMKK, but not CAMK2 or protein kinase A
(PKA; see 176911), blocked CMV-mediated glycolysis activation. CMV
infection also induced CAMKK1 mRNA and protein expression. Inhibition of
CAMKK had a negligible impact on CMV immediate-early protein
accumulation, but it severely attenuated production of CMV viral
progeny, reduced expression of 1 early CMV gene, and blocked viral DNA
replication. CAMKK inhibition had no impact on herpes simplex virus
(HSV)-1-induced glycolytic activation and a limited impact on HSV-1
replication. McArdle et al. (2011) concluded that CAMKK has a role that
is CMV specific and that it is an important factor in both CMV
replication and glycolytic activation.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the CAMKK1
gene to chromosome 17 (TMAP SHGC-32989).

ANIMAL MODEL

Blaeser et al. (2006) generated mice with targeted disruption of Camkk1
and carried out a variety of behavioral and learning and memory tests.
Mutant mice exhibited normal long-term spatial memory, cued fear memory,
basal synaptic transmission, and long-term potentiation. However, mutant
mice displayed deficient long-term contextual fear memory, as measured
in the post-shock freezing response. Mutant mice displayed decreased
stress-induced anxiety-like behavior; however, other measures of anxiety
such as the elevated plus maze and open field tests showed no difference
from wildtype. Blaeser et al. (2006) concluded that Camkk1 plays a
selective role in contextual fear memory. They showed that mice lacking
Camkk1 displayed decreased phosphorylation and activation of Camk4 and
Creb in specific brain areas involved in contextual fear memory
formation.

CLONING

By searching databases for homologs of CALHM1 (612234),
Dreses-Werringloer et al. (2008) identified CALHM2. The deduced
323-amino acid protein contains 4 hydrophobic regions and shares 26%
identity with CALHM1. Bioinformatic analysis suggested that CALHM2 is
widely expressed.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Exposure to interferons (IFNs; see, for example, 147570) leads to a
modulation in the levels of many cellular proteins (see 604456) that
mediate the pleiotropic effects of IFNs. Using a rabbit polyclonal
antibody against PKR p68 (PRKR; 176871), Kadereit et al. (1993) isolated
from interferon-induced Daudi cells crossreacting but otherwise
unrelated cDNAs encoding IFI41 and IFI75. IFI75 cDNA hybridized in
Northern blots with 2-kb mRNA from IFN-induced cells. IFI41 cDNA
hybridized in Northern blots with 2-kb mRNA from IFN-induced cells and
with 0.5-kb mRNA from both induced and control cells. Sequence analysis
revealed that IFI41 and IFI75 are very hydrophilic 248- and 371-amino
acid polypeptides, respectively, are rich in basic residues, and have
several potential phosphorylation sites. The 2 proteins contain an
identical 204-amino acid stretch and have protamine- and histone-like
nuclear targeting sequences. Expression in the rabbit reticulocyte
lysate system directed the synthesis of a 52-kD IFI75 protein, higher
than the calculated molecular mass of 42 kD. IFI75 expression in Sf9
cells in the baculovirus system resulted in a phosphorylated 65- to
67-kD protein that is associated with the nuclear pellet after NP40
detergent extraction. IFI41 had a molecular mass of 30 kD. In contrast
to IFI75, IFI41 was toxic for Sf9 cells in the baculovirus system.

GENE FUNCTION

Welsh et al. (1999) demonstrated that IFI41 is localized to the
nucleolus in mammalian cells. IFI75 is localized primarily in the
periphery of the nucleolus but is also found throughout the nucleoplasm
in mammalian cells. Treatment with interferon resulted in a
translocation of IFI41 to the periphery of the nucleolus. The authors
suggested that IFI41 and IFI75, in association with nucleolin, with
which they colocalize, play a role in ribosome biogenesis.

SP110 is associated with the PML (see 102578) nuclear body, a
macromolecular complex within the nucleus that is deployed to areas of
active host or viral DNA replication, transcription, and repair. In
addition to the regulation of gene transcription, the PML nuclear body
is involved in other cellular processes such as apoptosis, cell cycle
control, and the immune response. The findings of Roscioli et al. (2006)
were consistent with an important role of SP110 in the immune response
without being essential for PML nuclear body formation. The study
indicated that SP110 has an important role in immunoprotective
mechanisms against infectious organisms in humans.

Pan et al. (2005) identified a gene, which they designated intracellular
pathogen resistance-1 (Ipr1), within Sst1 (super-susceptibility to
tuberculosis-1) in the mouse. The Ipr1 gene is upregulated in the
Sst1-resistant macrophages after activation and infection, but it is not
expressed in the Sst1-susceptible macrophages. Expression of the Ipr1
transgene in the Sst1-susceptible macrophages limits the multiplication
not only of M. tuberculosis but also of Listeria monocytogenes and
switches a cell death pathway of the infected macrophages from necrosis
to apoptosis. Pan et al. (2005) concluded that the Ipr1 gene product
might have a previously undocumented function in integrating signals
generated by intracellular pathogens with mechanisms controlling innate
immunity, cell death, and pathogenesis. SP110 is the closest homolog of
the Ipr1 protein in humans. Both Ipr1 and the human SP110 proteins
contain motifs that are involved in protein-protein interactions (Sp100
domain), chromatin binding (SAND domain), nuclear localization signal,
and the nuclear receptor-binding (NRB) motif LXXLL.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the SP110
gene to chromosome 2q37.1 (TMAP stSG16476).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Hepatic venoocclusive disease with immunodeficiency syndrome (VODI;
235550) is an autosomal recessive primary immunodeficiency associated
with hepatic vascular occlusion and fibrosis. Roscioli et al. (2006)
performed homozygosity mapping in 4 affected individuals with VODI and
their parents, mapping the disorder to 2q36.3-q37.1. Fine-mapping
studies identified a conserved haplotype of 3 short tandem repeat (STR)
markers spanning a genomic interval of 1.422 Mb that contained the SP110
gene. Screening of the coding exons of SP110 for mutations by DNA
sequencing identified a homozygous single-base deletion, 642delC
(604457.0001), in exon 5 in affected individuals from 4 families. In a
fifth family no living affected individuals were available, but the
consanguineous parents and unaffected children were shown to share a
heterozygous single-base deletion, 40delC (604457.0002), in exon 2 on a
different haplotype background from the other 4 families. That mutation
was homozygous in archival material from the deceased member of family
5. Neither mutation was found in 50 unrelated Lebanese controls and no
mutation was found in the coding regions of SP110 in 89 isolated cases
of common variable immunodeficiency (240500) of European or Middle
Eastern origin.

The mouse Ipr1 gene, a homolog of SP110, has been shown to have a major
role in the outcome of tuberculosis infection (see 607948). Tosh et al.
(2006) examined 27 SNPs in the SP110 gene in 219 Gambian families and
identified 3 that were associated with tuberculosis: C/T in exon 11
(dbSNP rs3948464; 604457.0003), a nonsynonymous change in which the C
allele encodes ser425 and the T allele encodes leu425; T/C in intron 6
(dbSNP rs2114592; 604457.0004); and A/G in intron 10. For these 3 SNPs,
the most common allele was transmitted more often than expected to
affected offspring. Examination of an additional 99 Guinean and 102
Guinea-Bissau families independently replicated the associations for the
SNPs in exon 11 and intron 6. None of the SNPs affected known functional
domains of SP110, although the intronic SNPs may have roles in
alternative splicing. All 3 associated SNPs in Gambian families were in
strong linkage disequilibrium and were found to lie within a 31-kb block
of low haplotype diversity.

Thye et al. (2006) observed no significant differences in the
frequencies of 21 SP100 variants, including leu425 to ser, between 2,004
sputum-positive, HIV-negative Ghanaian tuberculosis patients and 1,231
exposed, healthy personal contacts and 1,135 community controls. They
concluded that an association of SP100 variants and distinct phenotypes
of human M. tuberculosis infection is doubtful.

Szeszko et al. (2007) genotyped 29 SNPs in SP110, including 7 causing
amino acid changes, and 15 ancestry-informative markers as genomic
controls in nearly 2,000 HIV-seronegative, M. tuberculosis
culture-positive Russians and a similar number of controls. They found
no evidence for association of SP11O SNPs, including leu425 to ser, with
susceptibility to adult pulmonary tuberculosis. Szeszko et al. (2007)
proposed that the effect of SP110 polymorphisms in outbred human
populations may be smaller than the effect of Ipr1 in inbred mice and
emphasized the importance of whole-genome scans to identify genes and
causal variants predisposing to tuberculosis in human populations.

leu425. The most common allele (C) was transmitted more often than

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Retinoid signaling is transduced by 2 families of nuclear receptors,
retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and retinoid X receptor (RXR; see 180245),
which form RXR/RAR heterodimers. In the absence of ligand, DNA-bound
RXR/RARA represses transcription by recruiting the corepressors NCOR1
(600849), SMRT (NCOR2; 600848), and histone deacetylase (see 601241).
When ligand binds to the complex, it induces a conformational change
allowing the recruitment of coactivators, histone acetyltransferases
(see 603053), and the basic transcription machinery. Translocations that
always involve rearrangement of the RARA gene are a cardinal feature of
acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL; 612376). The most frequent
translocation is t(15,17)(q21;q22), which fuses the RARA gene with the
PML gene (102578) (Vitoux et al., 2007).

CLONING

Petkovich et al. (1987) cloned a cDNA encoding a protein that bound
retinoic acid with high affinity. The protein was found to be homologous
to the receptors for steroid hormones, thyroid hormones, and vitamin D3,
and appeared to be a retinoic acid-inducible transacting enhancer
factor. Thus, the molecular mechanisms of the effect of vitamin A on
embryonic development, differentiation and tumor cell growth may be
similar to those described for other members of this nuclear receptor
family. The genes for all the steroid/thyroid receptors show a common
pattern of structure, with 4 regions: A/B, C, D, and E (Robertson,
1987). The function of region A/B is unknown; C encodes the DNA-binding
domain; D is believed to be a hinge region; and E encodes the
ligand-binding domain. In general, the DNA-binding domain is most highly
conserved, both within and between the 2 groups of receptors (steroid
and thyroid); the ligand-binding domains show less homology.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hjalt and Murray (1999) determined that the RARA gene contains 9 exons,
with the start codon in exon 2.

MAPPING

Arveiler et al. (1988) described a RFLP of the RAR gene. Bale et al.
(1988) indicated that the RAR locus had been assigned to chromosome 17
by study of human-rodent somatic cell hybrids. Using a cDNA probe,
Mattei et al. (1988) localized the RAR gene to 17q21 by in situ
hybridization.

Brand et al. (1988) presented evidence for the existence of 2 retinoic
acid receptors, RAR-alpha and RAR-beta (RARB; 180220), mapping to
chromosome 17q21.1 and 3p24, respectively. The alpha and beta forms of
RAR were found to be more homologous to the 2 closely related thyroid
hormone receptors alpha (190120) and beta (190160), located on 17q11.2
and 3p25-p21, respectively, than to any other members of the nuclear
receptor family. These observations suggest that the thyroid hormone and
retinoic acid receptors evolved by gene, and possibly chromosome,
duplications from a common ancestor, which itself diverged rather early
in evolution from the common ancestor of the steroid receptor group of
the family. They noted that the counterparts of the human RARA and RARB
genes are present in both the mouse and chicken genomes. By genetic
linkage studies using multiple DNA markers from the 17q12-q21 region,
Anderson et al. (1993) placed the RARA gene on the genetic map of the
region.

Mattei et al. (1991) mapped the RARA, RARB, and RARG (180190) genes in
man, mouse, and rat, thereby establishing or confirming and extending
the following homologies: (1) between human chromosome 17, mouse
chromosome 11, and rat chromosome 10, as indicated by the location of
RARA; (2) between human chromosome 3, mouse chromosome 14, and rat
chromosome 15, as indicated by RARB; and (3) between human chromosome
12, mouse chromosome 15, and rat chromosome 7, as indicated by RARG. The
various assignments also indicated the retention of tight linkage
between RAR and HOX gene clusters. Nadeau et al. (1992) pointed out
that, in the mouse, RARA is located on chromosome 11 near the homeobox-2
complex (see 142960) and the keratin type I complex (148080), whereas
RARG is on mouse chromosome 15 near the homeobox-3 complex (see 142970)
and the keratin type II complex (see 139350). The close proximity of
these genes may be functionally significant but has evolutionary
significance, at any rate, indicating the existence of homeologous
segments of both in man and mouse.

GENE FUNCTION

McNamara et al. (2001) reported a hormone-dependent interaction of the
nuclear receptors RARA and RXRA (180245) with CLOCK (601851) and MOP4
(603347). They found that these interactions negatively regulate
CLOCK-BMAL1 (602550) and MOP4-BMAL1 heterodimer-mediated transcriptional
activation of clock gene expression in vascular cells. MOP4 exhibited a
robust rhythm in the vasculature, and retinoic acid could phase shift
PER2 (603426) mRNA rhythmicity in vivo and in serum-induced smooth
muscle cells in vitro, providing a molecular mechanism for hormonal
control of clock gene expression. McNamara et al. (2001) proposed that
circadian or periodic availability of nuclear hormones may play a
critical role in resetting a peripheral vascular clock.

Germain et al. (2002) showed that RXR can bind ligand and recruit
coactivators as a heterodimer with apo-retinoic acid receptor (apo-RAR).
However, in the usual cellular environment corepressors do not
dissociate and they prohibit coactivator access because coregulator
binding is mutually exclusive.

Epping et al. (2005) identified PRAME (606021) as a dominant repressor
of retinoic acid receptor signaling. PRAME bound to RARA in the presence
of retinoic acid, preventing receptor activation, and PRAME expression
conferred resistance to retinoic acid-induced proliferation arrest,
differentiation, and apoptosis. Knockdown of PRAME in melanoma (155600)
cells using siRNA restored RAR signaling and reinstated sensitivity to
the antiproliferative effects of retinoic acid in vitro and in vivo.
Epping et al. (2005) noted that PRAME is overexpressed in a variety of
cancers, and likely confers growth or survival advantages in these cells
by antagonizing RAR signaling.

Fujiki et al. (2009) reported that nuclear GlcNAcylation of a histone
lysine methyltransferase (HKMT), MLL5 (608444), by O-GlcNAc transferase
(300255) facilitates retinoic acid-induced granulopoiesis in human HL60
promyelocytes through methylation of H3K4. MLL5 was biochemically
identified in a GlcNAcylation-dependent multisubunit complex associating
with nuclear retinoic acid receptor RAR-alpha, serving as a mono- and
dimethyl transferase to H3K4. GlcNAcylation at thr440 in the MLL5 SET
domain evoked its H3K4 HKMT activity and coactivated RAR-alpha in target
gene promoters. Increased nuclear GlcNAcylation by means of O-GlcNAc
transferase potentiated retinoic acid-induced HL60 granulopoiesis and
restored the retinoic acid response in the retinoic acid-resistant
HL60-R2 cell line. Thus, nuclear MLL5 GlcNAcylation triggers cell
lineage differentiation of HL60 through activation of its HKMT activity.

- RARA Fusion Proteins

For information on the generation of RARA fusion genes through
translocations associated with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), see
CYTOGENETICS.

Chen et al. (1994) cloned cDNAs encoding PLZF (176797)-RARA chimeric
proteins and studied their transactivating activities. A
'dominant-negative' effect was observed when PLZF-RARA fusion proteins
were cotransfected with vectors expressing RARA and RXRA. These abnormal
transactivation properties observed in retinoic acid-sensitive myeloid
cells strongly implicated the fusion proteins in the molecular
pathogenesis of APL.

Fusion of PML (102578) and TIF1A (603406) to RARA and BRAF (164757),
respectively, results in the production of PML-RAR-alpha and
TIF1-alpha-B-RAF (T18) oncoproteins. Zhong et al. (1999) showed that
PML, TIF1-alpha, and RXR-alpha (180245)/RAR-alpha function together in a
retinoic acid-dependent transcription complex. They found that PML acts
as a ligand-dependent coactivator of RXR-alpha/RARA-alpha. T18, similar
to PML-RAR-alpha, disrupts the retinoic acid-dependent activity of this
complex in a dominant-negative manner, resulting in a growth advantage.
PML-RAR-alpha was the first example of an oncoprotein generated by the
fusion of 2 molecules participating in the same pathway, specifically
the fusion of a transcription factor to one of its own cofactors. Since
the PML and RAR-alpha pathways converge at the transcriptional level,
there is no need for a double-dominant-negative product to explain the
pathogenesis of APL.

Grignani et al. (1998) demonstrated that both PML-RAR-alpha and
PLZF-RAR-alpha fusion proteins recruit the nuclear corepressor (NCOR;
see 600849)-histone deacetylase (see 601241) complex through the
RAR-alpha CoR box. PLZF-RAR-alpha contains a second, retinoic
acid-resistant binding site in the PLZF amino-terminal region. High
doses of retinoic acid release histone deacetylase activity from
PML-RAR-alpha, but not from PLZF-RAR-alpha. Mutation of the NCOR binding
site abolishes the ability of PML-RAR-alpha to block differentiation,
whereas inhibition of histone deacetylase activity switches the
transcriptional and biologic effects of PLZF-RAR-alpha from being an
inhibitor to an activator of the retinoic acid signaling pathway.
Therefore, Grignani et al. (1998) concluded that recruitment of histone
deacetylase is crucial to the transforming potential of APL fusion
proteins, and the different effects of retinoic acid on the stability of
the PML-RAR-alpha and PLZF-RAR-alpha corepressor complexes determines
the differential response of APLs to retinoic acid.

RAR and acute myeloid leukemia-1 (AML1; 151385) transcription factors
are found in leukemias as fusion proteins with PML and ETO (CBFA2T1;
133435), respectively. Association of PML-RAR and AML1-ETO with the
NCOR-histone deacetylase complex is required to block hematopoietic
differentiation. Minucci et al. (2000) showed that PML-RAR and AML1-ETO
exist in vivo within high molecular weight nuclear complexes, reflecting
their oligomeric state. Oligomerization requires PML or ETO coiled-coil
regions and is responsible for abnormal recruitment of NCOR,
transcriptional repression, and impaired differentiation of primary
hematopoietic precursors. Fusion of RAR to a heterologous
oligomerization domain recapitulated the properties of PML-RAR,
indicating that oligomerization per se is sufficient to achieve
transforming potential. These results showed that oligomerization of a
transcription factor, imposing an altered interaction with
transcriptional coregulators, represents a novel mechanism of oncogenic
activation.

The recruitment of the nuclear receptor corepressor SMRT (NCOR2; 600848)
and subsequent repression of retinoid target genes is critical for the
oncogenic function of PML-RARA. Lin and Evans (2000) showed that the
ability of PML-RARA to form homodimers is both necessary and sufficient
for its increased binding efficiency to corepressor and its inhibitory
effects on hormonal responses in myeloid differentiation. Furthermore,
the authors found that altered stoichiometric interaction of SMRT with
PML-RARA homodimers may underlie these processes. An RXR mutant lacking
transactivation function AF2 recapitulated many biochemical and
functional properties of PML-RARA. Taken together, these results
indicated that altered dimerization of a transcription factor can be
directly linked to cellular transformation and implicated dimerization
interfaces of oncogenes as potential drug targets.

Lin et al. (1998) reported that the association of PLZF-RAR-alpha and
PML-RAR-alpha with the histone deacetylase complex helps to determine
both the development of APL and the ability of patients to respond to
retinoids. Consistent with these observations, inhibitors of histone
deacetylase dramatically potentiate retinoid-induced differentiation of
retinoic acid-sensitive, and restore retinoid responses of retinoic
acid-resistant, APL cell lines. Lin et al. (1998) concluded that
oncogenic retinoic acid receptors mediate leukemogenesis through
aberrant chromatin acetylation, and that pharmacologic manipulation of
nuclear receptor cofactors may be a useful approach in the treatment of
human disease.

Pandolfi (2001) reviewed the roles of the RAR-alpha and PML genes in the
pathogenesis of APL.

Zelent et al. (2001) reviewed the functions of the proteins encoded by
the different RAR-alpha partner genes found in association with acute
promyelocytic leukemia, and the implications that these may have for the
molecular pathogenesis of APL. The 5 genes reviewed were PML (102578),
PLZF (176797), NPM (164040), NUMA1 (164009), and STAT5B (604260).

The fusion protein PML-RARA initiates APL when expressed in the early
myeloid compartment of transgenic mice. Lane and Ley (2003) found that
PML-RARA was cleaved in several positions by a neutral serine protease
in a human myeloid cell line; purification revealed that the protease
was neutrophil elastase (ELA2; 130130). Immunofluorescence localization
studies suggested that cleavage of PML-RARA must have occurred within
the cell, perhaps within the nucleus. The functional importance of ELA2
for APL development was assessed in Ela2-deficient mice. More than 90%
of bone marrow PML-RARA-cleaving activity was lost in the absence of
Ela2, and Ela2-deficient animals, but not cathepsin G (116830)-deficient
animals, were protected from APL development. The authors determined
that primary mouse and human APL cells also contained ELA2-dependent
PML-RARA-cleaving activity. Lane and Ley (2003) concluded that, since
ELA2 is maximally produced in promyelocytes, it may play a role in APL
pathogenesis by facilitating the leukemogenic potential of PML-RARA.

Villa et al. (2006) found that MBD1 (156535) cooperated with PML-RARA in
transcriptional repression and cellular transformation in human cell
lines. PML-RARA recruited MBD1 to its target promoter through an HDAC3
(605166)-mediated mechanism. Binding of HDAC3 and MBD1 was not confined
to the target promoter, but was instead spread over the locus. Knockdown
of HDAC3 expression by RNA interference in acute promyelocytic leukemia
cells alleviated PML-RARA-induced promoter silencing. Furthermore,
retroviral expression of dominant-negative mutants of MBD1 in human
hematopoietic precursors interfered with PML-RARA-induced repression and
restored cell differentiation. Villa et al. (2006) concluded that
PML-RARA recruits an HDAC3-MBD1 complex to target promoters to establish
and maintain chromatin silencing.

Guidez et al. (2007) identified CRABP1 (180230) as a target of both PLZF
and the RARA/PLZF fusion protein. PLZF repressed CRABP1 through
propagation of chromatin condensation from a remote intronic binding
element, culminating in silencing of the CRABP1 promoter. Although the
canonical PLZF/RARA oncoprotein had no effect on PLZF-mediated
repression, the reciprocal translocation product, RARA/PLZF, bound to
this remote binding site, recruited p300 (EP300; 602700), and induced
promoter hypomethylation and CRABP1 upregulation. Similarly, retinoic
acid-resistant murine blasts that expressed both fusion proteins
expressed much higher levels of Crabp1 than retinoic acid-sensitive
cells expressing Plzf/Rara alone. RARA/PLZF conferred retinoic acid
resistance to a retinoid-sensitive acute myeloid leukemia cell line in a
CRABP1-dependent fashion. Guidez et al. (2007) concluded that
upregulation of CRABP1 by RARA/PLZF contributes to retinoid resistance
in leukemia.

CYTOGENETICS

- RARA/PML Fusion Gene

Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), known as acute myeloid leukemia-3,
AML3, or M3 in the French-American-British (FAB) classification, is
characterized by a predominance of malignant promyelocytes that carry a
reciprocal translocation between the long arms of chromosomes 15 and 17:
t(15;17)(q22;q11.2-q12). This translocation is diagnostic for APL, as it
is present in almost 100% of cases. Borrow et al. (1990) used a NotI
linking clone to detect this translocation on pulsed field gel
electrophoresis and subsequently with conventional Southern analysis.
The breakpoints in 10 APL cases examined were shown to cluster in a
12-kb region of chromosome 17, which contained 2 CpG-rich islands. A
comparison of the sequence of cDNA clones from the region of the
breakpoint was compared with the EMBL database revealed that the cDNA
was that of RARA, which maps to 17q21.1, distal to the APL breakpoint
region. They concluded that the cDNAs lay outside the 12-kb breakpoint
region and that all of the 15q+ APL breakpoints lie in the first intron
of RARA. Since RARA is interrupted in an intron, it is most likely that
the product of the translocation is a fusion protein. Borrow et al.
(1990) suggested that the chimeric fusion protein encoded by the 15q+
derivative would retain the DNA- and ligand-binding domains of RARA,
whereas the transcription-activating function of the 5-prime end of RARA
would be replaced with a novel N-terminus, potentially changing the
profile of genes activated. The involvement of RARA at the APL
breakpoint may explain why the use of retinoic acid as a therapeutic
differentiation agent in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemias is
limited to APL. Lemons et al. (1990) also cloned the APL breakpoint
region.

Because RARA maps close to the breakpoint of the t(15;17) translocation
specifically associated with acute promyelocytic leukemia, and because
retinoic acid has the ability to induce in vivo differentiation of APL
cells into mature granulocytes, de The et al. (1990) analyzed the RARA
gene structure and expression in APL cells. In one APL-derived cell
line, they found that the RARA gene had been translocated to a locus,
MYL (PML; 102578), on chromosome 15, resulting in the synthesis of an
MYL/RARA fusion mRNA. (PML later became the preferred designation for
the chromosome 15 gene that contributed to the chimeric gene product.)
Using 2 probes located on either side of the cloned breakpoint, they
found genomic rearrangements of one or the other locus in 6 of 8
patients, demonstrating that the RARA and/or MYL genes are frequently
rearranged in APL and that the breakpoints are clustered. The findings
strongly implicated RARA in leukemogenesis.

Alcalay et al. (1991) likewise demonstrated that the chromosome 17
breakpoint in APL lies within the RARA locus. The translocation site
occurred in the 3-prime end of the RARA intron 1, 370 bp upstream from
the splicing donor site of exon 2, and separated the first coding exon
(exon 1) from the rest of the gene. By in situ hybridization, they
mapped a probe from the translocation site to normal 15q23-q24, which is
more distal than the site determined by others for either the chromosome
17 break in APL or the location of the normal RARA gene.

Hiorns et al. (1994) showed that APL patients with cytogenetically
normal chromosomes 15 and 17 may nevertheless have involvement of both
PML and RARA genes. Thus there is a subgroup of APL,
t(15;17)-negative/PML-RARA-positive, that is analogous to Philadelphia
chromosome-negative/BCR-ABL-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML;
608232). The amount of chromosome 17 material inserted into chromosome
15 in the case studied by Hiorns et al. (1994) was too small to be
detected cytogenetically. In cases of Philadelphia
chromosome-negative/BCR-ABL-positive CML, the amount of DNA transferred
can be substantial (Rassool et al., 1990).

- RARA/PLZF Fusion Gene

Almost all patients with APL have a chromosomal translocation
t(15;17)(q22;q21). Molecular studies reveal that the translocation
results in a chimeric gene through fusion between the PML gene on
chromosome 15 and the RARA gene on chromosome 17 (Chen et al., 1993).
Chen et al. (1993) reported studies of a Chinese patient with APL and a
variant translocation t(11;17)(q23;21) in which a gene on 11q23.1,
designated PLZF (176797), was fused to the RARA gene on chromosome 17.
Fluorescence in situ hybridization using a PLZF-specific probe localized
the PLZF gene to chromosome 11q23.1. Similar to t(15;17) APL, all-trans
retinoic acid treatment produced an early leukocytosis that was followed
by a myeloid maturation, but the patient died too early to achieve
remission.

- RARA/NUMA1 Fusion Gene

See Wells et al. (1997) and NUMA1 (164009) for discussion of a RAR-NUMA1
fusion gene associated with APL.

- RARA/PRKAR1A Fusion Gene

Catalano et al. (2007) reported a 66-year-old man with APL but without
the classic t(15;17) translocation. FISH and RT-PCR studies identified a
RARA/PRKAR1A fusion gene, possibly resulting from an insertion of RARA
distal to PRKAR1A on chromosome 17q24, followed by a deletion of 3-prime
PRKAR1A, 5-prime RARA, and any intervening sequences. The fusion
transcript resulted from cryptic splicing of the first 100 bases of
PRKAR1A exon 3 to RARA exon 3, and predicted a 495-amino acid fusion
protein. The C-terminal end of RARA involved is that shared by all RARA
rearrangements in APL. The patient had a good response to chemotherapy
with complete remission of the disease by 11 months.

ANIMAL MODEL

Cheng et al. (1999) generated transgenic mice with PLZF-RARA and NPM
(164040)-RARA. PLZF-RARA transgenic animals developed chronic myeloid
leukemia (CML; 608232)-like phenotypes at an early stage in life (within
3 months in 5 of 6 mice), whereas 3 NPM-RARA transgenic mice showed a
spectrum of phenotypes from typical APL to CML relatively late in life
(from 12 to 15 months). In contrast to bone marrow cells from PLZF-RARA
transgenic mice, those from NPM-RARA transgenic mice could be induced to
differentiate by all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). Cheng et al. (1999)
found that in interacting with nuclear coreceptors the 2 fusion proteins
had different ligand sensitivities, which may be the underlying
molecular mechanism for differential responses to ATRA. These data
clearly established the leukemogenic role of PLZF-RARA and NPM-RARA and
the importance of fusion receptor/corepressor interactions in the
pathogenesis as well as in determining different clinical phenotypes of
APL.

He et al. (2000) generated transgenic mice expressing RARA-PLZF and
PLZF-RARA in their promyelocytes. RARA-PLZF transgenic mice did not
develop leukemia. However, PLZF-RARA/RARA-PLZF double transgenic mice
developed leukemia with classic APL features. The authors demonstrated
that RARA-PLZF can interfere with PLZF transcriptional repression, and
that this is critical for APL pathogenesis, since leukemias in
PLZF-deficient/PLZF-RARA mutants and in PLZF-RARA/RARA-PLZF transgenic
mice were indistinguishable. Thus, both products of a cancer-associated
translocation are crucial in determining the distinctive features of the
disease.

In an animal model of acute promyelocytic leukemia, Padua et al. (2003)
developed a DNA-based vaccine by fusing the human PML-RARA oncogene to
tetanus fragment C (FrC) sequences. Padua et al. (2003) showed for the
first time that a DNA vaccine specifically targeted to an oncoprotein
can have a pronounced effect on survival, both alone and in combination
with ATRA. The survival advantage was concomitant with time-dependent
antibody production and an increase in interferon-gamma (IFNG; 147570).
Padua et al. (2003) also showed that ATRA therapy on its own triggered
an immune response in this model. When DNA vaccination and conventional
ATRA therapy were combined, they induced protective immune responses
against leukemia progression in mice. Padua et al. (2003) concluded that
this may provide a new approach to improve clinical outcome in human
leukemia.

Keegan et al. (2005) presented a new mechanism for regulating the number
of progenitor cells in organ development by limiting their density
within a competent region. Using a zebrafish mutation that disrupts
function of raldh2 (603687), they demonstrated that retinoic acid
signaling restricted cardiac specification in the zebrafish embryo.
Reduction of retinoic acid signaling caused formation of an excess of
cardiomyocytes, via fate transformations that increased cardiac
progenitor density within a multipotential zone. Thus, retinoic acid
signaling creates a balance between cardiac and noncardiac identities,
thereby refining the dimensions of the cardiac progenitor pool.

602518	TITLE *602518 LECTIN, GALACTOSIDE-BINDING, SOLUBLE, 4; LGALS4
;;GALECTIN 4; GAL4
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Galectins are a family of animal lectins defined by an affinity for
beta-galactoside-containing saccharides and by shared sequence elements.
Using a differential hybridization strategy to isolate genes whose
expression was modified during colorectal carcinogenesis, Rechreche et
al. (1997) identified a cDNA encoding galectin-4 (LGALS4). The 323-amino
acid LGALS4 protein contains 2 homologous, approximately 150-amino acid
carbohydrate recognition domains and all amino acids typically conserved
in galectins. Northern blot analysis showed that expression of the
1.2-kb LGALS4 transcript was restricted to small intestine, colon, and
rectum.

Huflejt et al. (1997) independently cloned a cDNA encoding LGALS4. They
found that LGALS4 is expressed as a 38-kD protein in the human colon
adenocarcinoma T84 cell line. By immunocytochemistry, the authors showed
that LGALS4 and LGALS3 (153619) had different cellular localizations. In
confluent T84 cells, LGALS4 was mainly cytosolic and was concentrated at
the basal membrane. In subconfluent T84 cells, it was found in
attachment sites of newly seeded cells and was concentrated at the
leading edge of lamellipodia. Based on the localization of LGALS4 and
the ability of immobilized recombinant rat Lgals4 to enhance adhesion of
T84 cells, Huflejt et al. (1997) suggested that LGALS4 plays a role in
cell adhesion.

GENE FUNCTION

Rechreche et al. (1997) compared the LGALS4 mRNA levels in the colon
adenocarcinoma and adjacent normal mucosa of 19 patients and found that
LGALS4 expression was 1.5- to 50-fold lower in the tumor in 18 patients.
There was no significant correlation between the level of decreased
LGALS4 expression and the degree of differentiation or Duke state of the
tumor, suggesting that decreased LGALS4 expression occurs early in
colorectal carcinogenesis.

By screening for innate proteins that could recognize human blood group
antigens, Stowell et al. (2010) identified GAL4 and GAL8 (LGALS8;
606099), both of which are expressed in the intestinal tract, as
proteins that recognized and killed E. coli expressing blood group
antigen, but not bacteria that did not express such antigens. Video,
fluorescence, and electron microscopy showed that bacterial cells lost
motility and membrane integrity upon treatment with these lectins.
Mutation analysis indicated that the killing activity was mediated by
the C-terminal domains of GAL4 and GAL8 in a rapid,
complement-independent manner. Stowell et al. (2010) concluded that
innate defense lectins provide immunity against pathogens expressing
blood group-like antigens on their surface.

MAPPING

Gross (2010) mapped the LGALS4 gene to chromosome 19q13.2 based on an
alignment of the LGALS4 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AB006781) and the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

615275	TITLE *615275 IMMUNORESPONSIVE GENE 1, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF; IRG1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

IRG1 is a highly conserved gene that encodes an enzyme that catalyzes
the decarboxylation of cis-aconitate to itaconic acid. Itaconic acid
inhibits isocitrate lyase, a key enzyme of the glyoxylate shunt, a
pathway essential for bacterial growth in macrophages (Michelucci et
al., 2013).

CLONING

Xiao et al. (2011) found that the predicted human IRG1 protein is highly
homologous to Irg1 proteins in chicken and various other mammals. By
RT-PCR of human fetal tissues, they detected IRG1 expression in
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) only. IRG1 expression in
adult PBMCs increased rapidly 18 hours after stimulation with
lipopolysaccharide (LPS), but IRG1 showed little to no expression before
this time point or 24 hours after stimulation. IRG1 expression was not
detected in unstimulated or LPS-stimulated leukemia cell lines.
Immunoblot analysis revealed a protein of about 80 kD, likely
representing full-length IRG1, in unstimulated fetal PBMCs and in adult
PBMCs 18 after LPS stimulation, with lower expression in adult PBMCs 24
hours after LPS stimulation.

GENE FUNCTION

Michelucci et al. (2013) performed metabolomic analysis of a mouse
macrophage cell line treated with Irg1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) and
stimulated with LPS and observed that the metabolite most affected by
Irg1 silencing was itaconic acid. Kinetic analysis showed that Irg1
expression preceded that of itaconic acid in mouse macrophages, and
purified human IRG1 catalyzed decarboxylation of cis-aconitate to
itaconic acid. Treatment of human macrophages with LPS also induced
expression of IRG1, but itaconic acid levels produced were lower than
those in mouse. Intraperitoneal injection of LPS increased expression of
mouse Irg1 and itaconic acid. Treatment of Salmonella enterica and
Mycobacterium tuberculosis, both of which synthesize isocitrate lyase
for biosynthesis through the glyoxylate shunt, with itaconic acid
resulted in dose-dependent inhibition of growth in minimal media.
Treatment of macrophages with Irg1 siRNA allowed increased bacterial
growth. Michelucci et al. (2013) concluded that IRG1 is upregulated upon
macrophage activation and mediates itaconic acid production, thereby
contributing to macrophage antimicrobial activity.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Xiao et al. (2011) mapped the IRG1 gene to
chromosome 13q22.3.

606489	TITLE *606489 EXOSOME COMPONENT 3; EXOSC3
;;RIBOSOMAL RNA-PROCESSING PROTEIN 40, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; RRP40
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The EXOSC3 gene encodes a core component of the human RNA exosome
complex that is present in the cytoplasm and the nucleus and especially
enriched in the nucleolus (Brouwer et al., 2001).

CLONING

Inherently unstable mammalian mRNAs contain AU-rich elements (AREs)
within their 3-prime untranslated regions. In yeast, 3-prime-to-5-prime
mRNA degradation is mediated by the exosome, a multisubunit particle.
Chen et al. (2001) purified and characterized the human exosome by mass
spectrometry and found its composition to be similar to its yeast
counterpart. They identified the following protein subunits within the
human exosome: p7, which is homologous to the yeast Rrp4 protein
(602238); p8, which is homologous to the yeast Rrp42 protein (606488);
p9, which is homologous to the yeast Rrp43 protein (OIP2; 606019); p10,
which is homologous to the yeast Rrp40 protein; p11, which is homologous
to the yeast Mtr3 protein (606490); p12A, which is homologous to the
yeast Rrp41 protein (606491); p12B, which is homologous to the yeast
Rrp46 protein (606492); and p13, which is homologous to the yeast Csl4
protein (606493). They also identified 2 exosome-associated factors, p1
(600478) and p14 (MPP6; 605500), that were not homologous to any yeast
exosome components.

By searching an EST database for homologs of yeast exosome components,
followed by PCR on a teratocarcinoma cell line and 5-prime RACE using
placenta RNA, Brouwer et al. (2001) isolated cDNAs encoding RRP40,
RRP41, and RRP46. The deduced 275-amino acid RRP40 protein is 88% and
30% identical to the mouse and yeast sequences, respectively. Western
blot analysis and immunofluorescence microscopy showed expression of a
31-kD protein in the nucleus, with additional forms expressed in the
cytoplasm and the highest concentration in nucleolus.

There are multiple alternatively spliced forms of EXOSC3, with the
longest reading frame encoding a 275-residue protein (summary by Wan et
al., 2012).

GENE STRUCTURE

Wan et al. (2012) stated that the EXOSC3 gene contains 4 exons.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a cell-free RNA decay system, Chen et al. (2001) demonstrated that
the mammalian exosome is required for rapid degradation of
ARE-containing RNAs but not for poly(A) shortening. They found that the
mammalian exosome does not recognize ARE-containing RNAs on its own. ARE
recognition required certain ARE-binding proteins that could interact
with the exosome and recruit it to unstable RNAs, thereby promoting
their rapid degradation.

Functional analysis by Brouwer et al. (2001) supported the conclusion
that RRP40 is present in human exosomes in a complex displaying
3-prime-to-5-prime exonuclease activity.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of 9 families with autosomal recessive
pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 1B (PCH1B; 614678), Wan et al. (2012)
identified homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the EXOSC3
gene (see, e.g., 606489.0001-606489.0005). The first mutation was
identified by genomewide scan and exome sequencing of a family with 4
affected brothers. The phenotype was severe and characterized by a
combination of cerebellar and spinal motor neuron degeneration beginning
at birth. There was diffuse muscle weakness, progressive microcephaly,
global and developmental delay, and brainstem involvement. The findings
indicated that proper RNA processing is important for the development
and survival of cerebellar and spinal motor neurons.

ANIMAL MODEL

Wan et al. (2012) found that morpholino knockdown of Exosc3 in zebrafish
embryos caused embryonic maldevelopment, with small brain size,
particularly in the hindbrain, a short and curved spine, and poor
motility. There was diminished expression of dorsal hindbrain
progenitor-specific markers and cerebellar-specific markers compared to
controls. The defects were largely rescued by coinjection with wildtype
zebrafish Exosc3 mRNA.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
PONTOCEREBELLAR HYPOPLASIA, TYPE 1B
EXOSC3, ASP132ALA

In 4 brothers from a family of American and European ancestry with
pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 1B (PCH1B; 614678), Wan et al. (2012)
identified a homozygous 395A-C transversion in exon 2 of the EXOSC3
gene, resulting in an asp132-to-ala (D132A) substitution in a highly
conserved residue in the putative RNA-binding S1 domain, which may be
important for intersubunit interaction within the exosome complex. The
mutation was identified by genomewide scan and exome sequencing, and
confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Sequencing of this gene identified the
same homozygous mutation in affected individuals from 3 additional
families with the disorder; 2 of these families were consanguineous.
Haplotype analysis of 3 of the families with a homozygous D132A mutation
was consistent with a remote common ancestor. Affected individuals in 3
additional families carried the D132A mutation in compound
heterozygosity with another pathogenic mutation in the EXOSC3 gene (see,
e.g., 606489.0002 and 606489.0003). All available unaffected parents
were heterozygous for 1 of the mutations, which were not found in 379
control individuals. The phenotype consisted of neonatal onset of severe
hypotonia, often with respiratory insufficiency, and global
developmental delay, without achieving any motor milestones or speech,
and progressive microcephaly. Other features included oculomotor
apraxia, progressive muscle wasting, and distal contractures. Brain MRI
showed marked cerebellar and pontine atrophy. Postmortem examination
showed severe loss of cerebellar and spinal motor neurons.

PONTOCEREBELLAR HYPOPLASIA, TYPE 1B
EXOSC3, ALA139PRO

In an 11-month-old Australian boy with PCH1B (614678), Wan et al. (2012)
identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the EXOSC3 gene: a
415G-C transition in exon 2 resulting in an ala139-to-pro (A139P)
substitution at a highly conserved residue in the RNA-binding S1 domain,
and D132A (606489.0001). Neither mutation was found in 379 control
individuals.

.0003
PONTOCEREBELLAR HYPOPLASIA, TYPE 1B
EXOSC3, 10-BP DEL, NT294

In a boy from New Caldonia with PCH1B (614678), Wan et al. (2012)
identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the EXOSC3 gene: a
10-bp deletion (294_303del) in exon 1, predicted to result in premature
truncation (99fs*11) or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, and D132A
(606489.0001). Neither mutation was found in 379 control individuals.

.0004
PONTOCEREBELLAR HYPOPLASIA, TYPE 1B
EXOSC3, GLY31ALA

In 2 Czech sibs with PCH1B (614678), Wan et al. (2012) identified
compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the EXOSC3 gene: a 92G-C
transversion in exon 1, resulting in a gly31-to-ala (G31A) substitution
at a highly conserved residue in the N-terminal domain, and a 712T-C
transition in exon 4, resulting in a trp238-to-arg (W238R; 606489.0005)
substitution at a highly conserved residue in the putative RNA-binding
KH domain. Another unrelated Czech boy with the disorder was homozygous
for the G31A mutation. Neither mutation was found in 379 control
individuals.

600456	TITLE *600456 NEUROTROPHIC TYROSINE KINASE, RECEPTOR, TYPE 2; NTRK2
;;TYROSINE KINASE RECEPTOR B; TRKB
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

For background information on the neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase
(NTRK) family, see NTRK1 (191315). The NTRK family specifically
interacts with neurotrophins, a small family of secreted proteins (see
NGFR; 162010), and mediates their function. NTRK2, also known as TRKB,
is the receptor for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF; 113505).
Together NTRK2 and BDNF regulate both short-term synaptic functions and
long-term potentiation of brain synapses.

CLONING

Nakagawara et al. (1995) isolated cDNAs spanning the entire coding
region of both human full-length and truncated forms of TRKB from human
brain cDNA libraries. The full-length TRKB coded for a protein of 822
amino acid residues. The putative mature peptide sequence was 49% and
55% homologous to human NTRK1 and NTRK3 (191316), respectively. Nine of
13 cysteine residues, 4 of 12 N-glycosylation sites in the extracellular
domain, and 10 of 13 tyrosine residues in the intracellular domain are
conserved among NTRK1, NTRK2, and NTRK3. Two major sizes of NTRK2
transcripts were expressed in human brain.

Using bioinformatic and RT-PCR analyses, Luberg et al. (2010) determined
that the NTRK2 gene is subject to a complex pattern of splicing and
produces at least 36 possible protein isoforms. The full-length TRKB
protein contains an N-terminal signal sequence, followed by a
cysteine-rich domain, a leucine-rich domain, a second cysteine-rich
domain, 2 immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains that make up the BDNF-binding
region, a transmembrane domain, an SHC (see 600560)-binding motif, a
tyrosine kinase domain near the C terminus, and a C-terminal PLC-gamma
(PLCG1; 172420)-docking site. Exons 6 through 15, except for exon 12,
are common to all transcripts. Transcripts initiating from exon 5c, and
lacking exons 1 through 5, encode an N-terminally truncated protein
lacking the signal sequence, leucine-rich domain, and most of the
cysteine-rich domains of full-length TRKB. PCR analysis showed that some
TRKB transcripts were expressed in all tissues examined, including
heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, pancreas, colon, testis, and prostate,
as well as in all specific adult brain regions. Transcripts initiating
from exon 5c were detected predominantly in neural tissues, although at
a much lower level than those containing exon 5. PCR analysis showed
that expression of specific TRKB transcripts was differentially
regulated during development of human prefrontal cortex. Expression of
the TRKB transcript encoding the full-length protein peaked during the
toddler stage. Most epitope-tagged TRKB proteins localized to both the
cell membrane and cytoplasm of transfected cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Soppet et al. (1991) demonstrated that the gp145 gene product of the
TRKB gene is rapidly phosphorylated on tyrosine residues upon exposure
to BDNF and NTF3. Furthermore, the gp145 gene product specifically binds
BDNF and NTF3 but does not bind NGF. Squinto et al. (1991) found that
both BDNF and NTF3, but not NGF, bind to TRKB, for which no ligand had
previously been identified. Human TRKA and TRKC have been cloned and
mapped to chromosome 1 and chromosome 15, respectively.

Bothwell (1996), Carter and Lewin (1997), and Bibel and Barde (2000)
reviewed neurotrophins and their receptors. Nerve growth factor receptor
(NGFR; 162010) is also referred to as p75(NTR) due to its molecular mass
and its ability to bind at low affinity not only NGF (see 162030), but
also other neurotrophins, including BDNF, neurotrophin-3 (NTF3; 162660),
and neurotrophin-4 (NTF4; 162662). As a monomer, NGFR binds NGF with low
affinity. Higher affinity binding is achieved by association with higher
molecular mass, low-affinity neurotrophin receptors, namely the
tropomyosin receptor kinases, TRKA (NTRK1), TRKB (NTRK2), and TRKC
(NTRK3). TRKA, TRKB, and TRKC are specific for or 'preferred by' NGF,
NTF4 and BDNF, and NTF3, respectively (Ip et al., 1993). NTF3 also binds
to TRKA and TRKB, but with significantly lower affinity.

To identify metastasis-associated oncogenes, Douma et al. (2004)
designed an unbiased genomewide functional screen solely on the basis of
anoikis (apoptosis resulting from loss of cell-matrix interactions)
suppression. The screen was based on rat intestinal epithelial cells
owing to their nonmalignancy and high sensitivity to anoikis. Douma et
al. (2004) reported the identification of TRKB as a potent and specific
suppressor of caspase-associated anoikis of nonmalignant epithelial
cells. By activating the phosphatidylinositol-3-hydroxykinase/protein
kinase B pathway, TRKB induced the formation of large cellular
aggregates that survived and proliferated in suspension. In mice, these
cells formed rapidly growing tumors that infiltrated lymphatics and
blood vessels to colonize distant organs. Consistent with the ability of
TRKB to suppress anoikis, metastases--whether small vessel infiltrates
or large tumor nodules--contained very few apoptotic cells. Douma et al.
(2004) concluded that these observations demonstrate the potent
oncogenic effects of TRKB and uncover a specific prosurvival function
that may contribute to its metastatic capacity, providing a possible
explanation for the aggressive nature of human tumors that overexpress
TRKB.

Neurotrophins (NTFs) act as survival and differentiation factors in the
nervous system and have been detected in the developing rodent testis.
To determine whether neurotrophins could influence development and
maturation of the human fetal testis, Robinson et al. (2003) examined
the cell-specific expression and distribution of several members of the
neurotrophin family and their receptors during the second trimester,
with particular emphasis on NT4 and TRKB. They detected expression of
mRNA for NGF, NTF3 and NTF4 (162662), brain-derived neurotrophic factor
(BDNF; 113505), the high-affinity receptors TRKA, TRKB, and TRKC, and
the low-affinity p75 receptor (NGFR) in the human testis between 14 and
19 weeks' gestation. NT4 mRNA and protein were predominantly localized
to the peritubular cells. These cells were also the site of expression
of p75. By contrast, NGF and NT3 were mainly expressed in Sertoli and
interstitial cells. The authors concluded that these data demonstrate
the expression of neurotrophins and their receptors in the human fetal
testis during the second trimester and indicate possible roles in the
regulation of proliferation and survival of germ cells and peritubular
cells.

Berghuis et al. (2005) found that anandamide, an endogenous cannabinoid,
acted as a chemoattractant and regulated rat Cb1r (CNR1;
114610)-positive interneuron migration by activating Trkb.
Anandamide-induced chemotaxis was additive with Bdnf-induced interneuron
migration, but prolonged anandamide exposure antagonized Bdnf-induced
differentiation of cortical interneurons. Neuronal differentiation was
associated with simultaneous recruitment of Cb1r and Trkb to axon
terminal segments in Cb1r-positive interneurons, and endocannabinoids
induced the assembly of Cb1r/Trkb complexes. In utero exposure of pups
to cannabinoids found in marijuana increased the density of hippocampal
Cck (118440)-positive interneurons, suggesting that overactivation of
CB1Rs affects postnatal positioning of developing neurons and prevents
proper patterning of cortical neuronal networks.

Using engineered embryonic stem cells, Nikoletopoulou et al. (2010)
demonstrated that the neurotrophin receptors TRKA (191315) and TRKC
(191316) instruct developing neurons to die, both in vitro and in vivo.
By contrast, TRKB, a closely related receptor primarily expression in
the central nervous system, does not. These results indicated that TRKA
and TRKC behave as dependence receptors, explaining why developing
sympathetic and sensory neurons become trophic factor-dependent for
survival. Nikoletopoulou et al. (2010) suggested that the expansion of
the TRK gene family that accompanied the segregation of the peripheral
from the central nervous system generated a novel mechanism of cell
number control.

Lobo et al. (2010) showed that deletion of TrkB, the BDNF receptor,
selectively from D1+ or D2+ neurons in the nucleus accumbens oppositely
affects cocaine reward. Because loss of TrkB in D2+ neurons increases
their neuronal excitability, Lobo et al. (2010) next used optogenetic
tools to control selectively the firing rate of D1+ and D2+ nucleus
accumbens neurons and studied consequent effects on cocaine reward.
Activation of D2+ neurons, mimicking the loss of TrkB, suppressed
cocaine reward, with opposite effects induced by activation of D1+
neurons.

By assaying transfected HEK293 cells, Luberg et al. (2010) showed that
all TRKB isoforms tested could autophosphorylate except for
TRKB-T-TK-delta-17, which lacks part of the intracellular tyrosine
kinase domain. However, TRKB-T-TK-delta-17 could be phosphorylated by
full-length TRKB.

GENE STRUCTURE

Yeo et al. (2004) stated that the TRKB gene contains 24 exons.

Luberg et al. (2010) noted that NTRK2 exons 1, 2, 3, 4, and the majority
of exon 5 constitute the 5-prime UTR of a number of NTRK2 transcripts.
These exons are GC rich, and each can serve as transcription start
sites. Luberg et al. (2010) also identified an additional NTRK2 exon,
5c, which introduces a new transcription start site 1.2 kb downstream
from exon 5. Exons 5 and 9 contain translational start sites.

MAPPING

Slaugenhaupt et al. (1995) identified a dinucleotide repeat within a
cosmid containing NTRK2 and used this marker to map the gene near D9S1
on the proximal long arm of chromosome 9. By fluorescence in situ
hybridization and somatic cell hybrid mapping, Nakagawara et al. (1995)
mapped the NTRK2 gene to 9q22.1. Slaugenhaupt et al. (1995) excluded
NTRK2 as a candidate for familial dysautonomia.

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Valent et al. (1997) confirmed
the assignment of NTRK2 to 9q22.

Dorsey et al. (2006) stated that mouse Ntrk2 maps to chromosome 13.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a boy with early-onset obesity, hyperphagia, and severe developmental
delay (613886), Yeo et al. (2004) identified a heterozygous de novo
mutation in the TRKB gene (600456.0001).

ANIMAL MODEL

To study the function of TRKB in the cerebellum, Rico et al. (2002)
deleted the Trkb gene in mouse cerebellar precursors by Wnt1-driven
Cre-mediated recombination. Despite the absence of Trkb, the mature
cerebellum of mutant mice appeared similar to that of wildtype, with all
types of cells present in normal numbers and positions. Granule and
Purkinje cell dendrites appeared normal, and the former had typical
numbers of excitatory synapses. By contrast, inhibitory interneurons
were strongly affected. Although present in normal number, inhibitory
interneurons exhibited reduced amounts of GABAergic markers and
developed reduced numbers of GABAergic boutons and synaptic
specializations. Thus, Rico et al. (2002) concluded that TRKB is
essential to the development of GABAergic neurons and regulates synapse
formation in addition to its role in the development of axon terminals.

Using the Cre-loxP recombination system, Minichiello et al. (1999)
generated conditionally gene targeted mice in which the knockout of
Ntrk2 was restricted to the forebrain and occurred only during postnatal
development. The conditional knockout mice were viable and developed
without gross morphologic defects. In behavioral tests, the adult
homozygous mutant mice exhibited a severe impairment in stressful
spatial learning tasks, but succeeded in less demanding, simple learning
tasks. Both the homozygous and heterozygous mutant mice showed reduced
hippocampal long-term synaptic potentiation, but the heterozygotes
appeared behaviorally normal. Electrophysiologic experiments led
Minichiello et al. (1999) to conclude that the mutant mice had normal
synaptic transmission, but impaired synaptic strengthening. The authors
suggested an essential role for NTRK2 signaling in complex learning and
synaptic plasticity mediated by the hippocampus and its proximally
connected forebrain structures.

Minichiello et al. (2002) found that targeted disruption of the
phospholipase C-gamma (PLCG; see 172420) docking site in mouse Ntrk2
impaired hippocampal long-term potentiation. Upon stimulation with BDNF,
these neurons displayed impaired induction of Creb (123810) and Camk4
(114080). Targeted disruption of the SHC (see 605217) docking site had
no effect on hippocampal long-term potentiation but reduced the ability
of BDNF-stimulated neurons to activate mitogen-activated protein kinases
(MAPKs; see 176948). Minichiello et al. (2002) concluded that MAPKs and
CREB act in parallel pathways, and that NRTK2 mediates hippocampal
plasticity via recruitment of PLCG and the subsequent phosphorylation of
CREB and CAMK4.

The melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R; 155541) has a critical role in
regulating energy balance, and mutations in the MC4R gene result in
obesity in mice and humans. Xu et al. (2003) found that similar to MC4R
mutants, mouse mutants that express decreased amounts of the BDNF
receptor TrkB showed hyperphagia and maturity-onset obesity, suggesting
a role for BDNF in energy balance. The authors found that BDNF is an
anorexigenic factor that is highly expressed in murine ventromedial
hypothalamic (VMH) nuclei and is regulated by feeding status. Deficiency
in MC4R signaling reduced expression of BDNF in the VMH, indicating that
BDNF and its receptor TrkB are downstream components in the
MC4R-mediated control of energy balance.

Zorner et al. (2003) investigated the behavioral characteristics of mice
with forebrain-specific knockout of Trkb. The mice showed stereotypic
hyperlocomotion with reduced explorative activity and impulsive
reactions to novel stimuli. No dysregulation of the
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis was observed under normal or
stressful conditions. Zorner et al. (2003) suggested that this mouse
line may be a good model of attention deficit disorder (see 143465).

Dorsey et al. (2006) noted that trisomy-16 (T16) in mouse causes altered
expression of the Trkb gene on chromosome 13, with overexpression of
Trkb.t1, an inactive truncated isoform of Trkb. Expression of Trkb.t1 in
T16 mice is associated with defects in Bdnf responsiveness, altered
phosphorylation and signaling through Trkb, elevated resting Ca(2+)
levels, and accelerated neuronal cell death. These effects are rescued
by overexpression of full-length, catalytically active Trkb. Using gene
targeting, Dorsey et al. (2006) showed that reduction of Trkb.t1 in T16
mice to levels found in wildtype euploid mice reduced apoptotic cell
death in T16 neurons in vitro and in vivo and restored T16 neuronal
responses to Bdnf. Trkb.t1 upregulation in T16 mice selectively reduced
Akt (see 164730) activation by Trkb in response to Bdnf, but it did not
alter Trkb-mediated activation of Erk (see 176948) signaling. Dorsey et
al. (2006) concluded that alternative splicing of the Trkb gene
regulates Trkb activity and that Trkb.t1 inhibits Trkb activity, but not
through a simple dominant-negative mechanism.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
OBESITY, HYPERPHAGIA, AND DEVELOPMENTAL DELAY
NTRK2, TYR722CYS

In a boy with early-onset obesity, hyperphagia, and severe developmental
delay (613886), Yeo et al. (2004) identified a heterozygous de novo
A-to-G transition in the TRKB gene, resulting in a tyr722-to-cys (Y722C)
substitution in a highly conserved residue in the activation loop of the
catalytic domain. The residue is conserved in all members of the Trk
family and in all species studied, including Xenopus laevis. Although
the patient had a normal birth weight, he rapidly gained weight from age
6 months, and his body mass index (BMI) was 3.5 SD above normal by age 8
years. Fasting plasma insulin was not markedly elevated and thyroid
function tests were normal. There were no dysmorphic features. He
demonstrated hyperphagia similar to individuals with congenital leptin
deficiency (see 164160). He also had severe developmental delay in motor
function, speech, and language, and demonstrated a blunted response to
nociceptive stimuli. Yeo et al. (2004) noted the phenotypic similarities
between their patient and the mouse model of TrkB deficiency reported by
Xu et al. (2003). In vitro functional expression studies showed that the
Y722C mutation was expressed normally on the cell surface, but resulted
in markedly impaired ligand-induced phosphorylation, as well as impaired
downstream MAPK (176948) phosphorylation.

604768	TITLE *604768 ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 254; ZNF254
;;ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 91-LIKE; ZNF91L
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Zinc finger proteins have been shown to interact with nucleic acids and
to have diverse functions. The zinc finger domain is a conserved amino
acid sequence motif containing 2 specifically positioned cysteines and 2
histidines that are involved in coordinating zinc. Kruppel-related
proteins form 1 family of zinc finger proteins. See ZFP93 (604749) for
additional information on zinc finger proteins.

CLONING

By sequencing cDNAs randomly selected from a cDNA library derived from
human umbilical cord CD34+ cells, Mao et al. (1998) identified the
ZNF254 gene, which they called HD-ZNF1. The full-length ZNF254 coding
sequence encodes a 353-amino acid protein with sequence similarity to
the Kruppel-related zinc finger protein HTF10, or ZNF91 (603971).

Han et al. (1999) also isolated a cDNA encoding ZNF254. The ZNF254
protein has 4 tandemly repeated C-terminal zinc finger motifs with
interspersed conserved knuckle sequences, as well as an N-terminal
Kruppel-associated box (KRAB). RT-PCR analysis detected variable
expression of ZNF254 that was highest in monocytic cell lines.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid mapping, Mao et al. (1998) mapped the ZNF254 gene to
19p13.12-p13.11.

600735	TITLE *600735 INTERFERON-INDUCED PROTEIN 35; IFI35
;;INTERFERON INDUCIBLE PROTEIN, 35-KD; IFP35
DESCRIPTION Interferons ( e.g., 147660) affect cellular functions by altering the
expression of a number of specific genes. Bange et al. (1994) reported a
human cDNA, designated IFP35 by them (interferon inducible protein of 35
kD), which they cloned from interferon-gamma induced HeLa cell mRNA
screened by differential hybridization. The cDNA encodes a 282-amino
acid predicted protein containing a leucine zipper motif at the amino
terminus. Unlike most other leucine zipper proteins, IFP35 lacks a basic
domain associated with DNA binding. Bange et al. (1994) found that in
vitro translation of IFP35 mRNA resulted in the synthesis of a 35-kD
protein. Northern blots showed that the 1.4-kb IFP35 mRNA occurs in
fibroblasts, macrophages, and epithelial cells following interferon
treatment. Western blots indicated that the IFP35 gene product can form
homodimers and that there was increased nuclear localization following
interferon treatment. Brown et al. (1995), as part of an effort to clone
the BRCA1 gene (113705), used exon trapping to identify genes in a
500-kb region on 17q21. Among the exons identified from a phage P1
artificial chromosome (PAC) that included regions from BRCA1 were
several coding regions with 100% identity to IFP35. Smith et al. (1996)
likewise found the IFP35 gene situated centromeric to the BRCA1 gene in
the course of sequencing and analyzing 117 kb of DNA from the 17q21
region.

612584	TITLE *612584 SPINSTER, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, 2; SPNS2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Kawahara et al. (2009) reported that human SPNS2 contains 548 amino
acids and shares significant homology with zebrafish Spns2.

GENE FUNCTION

Kawahara et al. (2009) showed that zebrafish Spns2, which contains 12
transmembrane domains, was expressed at the membrane of transfected
Chinese hamster ovary cells. Overexpression of either zebrafish or human
SPNS2 increased the release of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) into the
culture medium. Kawahara et al. (2009) concluded that SPNS2 functions as
an S1P transporter in S1P secretion.

MAPPING

Hartz (2009) mapped the SPNS2 gene to chromosome 17p13.2 based on an
alignment of the SPNS2 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC041772) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.1).

ANIMAL MODEL

Kawahara et al. (2009) found that an N-ethyl-N-nitrosurea-induced
arg153-to-ser mutation in zebrafish Spns2 led to cardiac bifida.
Expression of human SPNS2, but not human SPNS1 (612583), reversed the
defect. The defect was also rescued by S1P injection or by
reintroduction of zebrafish Spns2 in extraembryonic tissue yolk
syncytial layer. Kawahara et al. (2009) concluded that SPNS2 regulates
myocardial precursor migration.

614355	TITLE *614355 ACYL-CoA SYNTHETASE SHORT CHAIN FAMILY, MEMBER 1; ACSS1
;;ACYL-CoA SYNTHETASE 1; ACECS1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Fatty acids are incorporated into membranes and signaling molecules and
have roles in energy storage and metabolism. These essential functions
require activation of the fatty acid by acyl-coenzyme A (CoA)
synthetases, such as ACSS1, which form an activating thioester linkage
between the fatty acid and CoA (Watkins et al., 2007).

CLONING

Fujino et al. (2001) cloned mouse Acss1 and Acss2 (605832), which they
called Acecs1 and Acecs2, respectively. The deduced 701-amino acid Acss1
protein shares 45.8% identity with Acss2. Northern blot analysis
detected high expression of a 3.6-kb Acss1 transcript in liver, kidney,
and testis. Lower expression was detected in heart, brain, spleen, lung,
and skeletal muscle. Fractionation of mouse kidney revealed cytosolic
localization for Acss1 and mitochondrial localization for Acss2.

By database analysis, Watkins et al. (2007) identified human ACSS1. The
deduced 689-amino acid protein contains 4 of 5 motifs characteristic of
acyl-CoA synthetases. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that ACSS1 belongs
to a short chain clade of acyl-CoA synthetases.

GENE FUNCTION

By assaying proteins purified from transfected COS-7 cells, Fujino et
al. (2001) showed that both mouse Acss1 and Acss2 preferred acetate as
substrate for the synthesis of acetyl-CoA. Little to no activity was
detected with other short or medium chain fatty acids. Acss1 expression,
but not Acss2 expression, was induced by differentiation of mouse 3T3-L1
cells. In contrast, Acss2 expression, but not Acss1 expression, was
induced by fasting in mice and by diabetes in Zucker rats.

GENE STRUCTURE

Watkins et al. (2007) determined that the ACSS1 gene contains 14 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Watkins et al. (2007) mapped the ACSS1
gene to the minus strand of chromosome 20p11.23-p11.21.

123295	TITLE *123295 CREATINE KINASE, MITOCHONDRIAL 2; CKMT2
;;CREATINE KINASE, SARCOMERIC MITOCHONDRIAL; CKMTS
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Creatine kinase (EC 2.7.3.2) isoenzymes such as CKMT2 are crucial to
energy metabolism, particularly in tissues with high energy
requirements. Nuclear genes encode 4 known CK subunits: cytoplasmic
muscle (CKM; 123310), cytoplasmic brain (CKB; 123280), ubiquitous
mitochondrial (CKMT1; 123290), and sarcomeric mitochondrial (CKMT2)
(summary by Klein et al., 1991).

CLONING

Klein et al. (1991) reported the isolation and characterization of the
CKMT2 gene.

GENE STRUCTURE

Klein et al. (1991) determined that the CKMT2 gene contains 11 exons and
encompasses more than 37 kb. The sites of exon localization in the CKMT2
coding region and their precise sizes are identical to those of the
CKMT1 gene. The translation start codon is in the third exon and lies 17
kb from the transcription start site.

MAPPING

Klein et al. (1991) assigned the CKMT2 gene to chromosome 5 by analysis
of human/hamster somatic cell hybrid DNAs. The CKMTS gene contains
sequences homologous to several motifs that are shared among some
nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins and that may be essential
for the coordinated activation of these genes during mitochondrial
biogenesis.

Richard et al. (1993) assigned the CKMT2 gene to chromosome 5q13.3 by in
situ hybridization.

;;INTERLEUKIN 13 RECEPTOR, ALPHA; IL13RA;;
NR4, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Hilton et al. (1996) cloned murine NR4, a previously unrecognized
receptor identified on the basis of sequence similarity with members of
the hemopoietin receptor family. By using transient expression of the
mouse NR4 in COS-7 cells, they found that NR4 encodes the IL13 receptor
alpha-chain, a low-affinity receptor capable of binding IL13 (147683)
but not IL4 (147780) or interleukins 2, 7, 9, or 15. The NR4 cDNA was
predicted to encode a protein of 424 amino acid residues, containing a
putative signal sequence and transmembrane domain.

Aman et al. (1996) cloned cDNAs corresponding to the human IL13R-alpha
chain (see also IL13RA2; 300130). The protein had 76% homology to murine
IL13R-alpha, with 95% amino acid identity in the cytoplasmic domain.

GENE FUNCTION

IL4 and IL13 are 2 cytokines that are secreted by activated T cells and
have similar effects on monocytes and B cells. Zurawski et al. (1993)
demonstrated that the IL4 receptor (147781) is a complex of at least 2
components. They described a mutant form of human IL4 that competitively
antagonizes both human IL4 and human IL13. The amino acid sequences of
IL4 and IL13 are approximately 30% homologous, and circular dichroism
spectroscopy demonstrates that both proteins have a highly alpha-helical
structure. IL13 competitively inhibited binding of IL4 to functional
human IL4 receptors expressed on a cell line that responds to both IL4
and IL13. The binding of IL4 to an IL4-responsive cell line that does
not respond to IL13, and the binding of IL4 to cloned IL4R ligand
binding protein expressed on heterologous cells, were not inhibited by
IL13. The results demonstrated that IL4 and IL13 share a receptor
component that is important for signal transduction. Hilton et al.
(1996) reviewed these and other data suggesting a model of IL4 and IL13
receptor composition and function.

Hilton et al. (1996) showed that stable expression of NR4 in the
cytotoxic T-cell line CTLL2 resulted in the generation of high-affinity
IL13 receptors capable of transducing a proliferative signal in response
to IL13 and, moreover, led to competitive cross-reactivity in the
binding of IL4 and IL13. These results suggested to the authors that the
IL13 receptor alpha-chain (NR4) is a primary binding subunit of the IL13
receptor and may also be a component of IL4 receptors.

Only weak IL13 binding activity was found by Aman et al. (1996) in cells
transfected with only IL13R-alpha; however, the combination of both
IL13R-alpha and IL4R-alpha resulted in substantial binding activity,
indicating that both chains are essential components of the IL13
receptor. Whereas IL13R-alpha served as an alternative accessory protein
to the common cytokine receptor gamma chain for IL4 signaling, it could
not replace the function of gamma(c) (IL2RG; 308380) in allowing
enhanced IL2 binding activity. Nevertheless, the overall size and length
of the cytoplasmic domain of IL13R-alpha and gamma(c) are similar, and
like gamma(c), the IL13R-alpha gene (IL13RA) is located on the X
chromosome.

Because IL4 and IL13 and their specific signaling pathways are
considered attractive targets for the treatment of allergy and asthma,
Kelly-Welch et al. (2003) reviewed the signaling connections of these
cytokines. IL4 interacts with IL4R with high affinity, leading to
dimerization with either the common gamma chain (IL2RG), a component of
receptors for a number of cytokines, to create a type I receptor, or
with IL13RA1 to form a type II receptor. IL13, on the other hand, binds
with high affinity to IL13RA1, which induces heterodimerization with
IL4R to form a complex identical to the type II receptor. Alternatively,
IL13 may bind with even greater affinity to IL13RA2, which fails to
induce a signal, indicating that it acts as a decoy receptor. The
C-terminal tails of the IL4 and IL13 receptor subunits interact with
tyrosine kinases of the Janus kinase family (e.g., JAK1; 147795),
leading to interaction with STAT6 (601512), which binds to consensus
sequences in the promoters of IL4- and IL13-regulated genes. Kelly-Welch
et al. (2003) proposed that subtle differences in IL4 and IL13 signaling
due to polymorphisms near docking sites in IL4R may have profound
implications for allergy and asthma.

Using RT-PCR and flow cytometric analysis, Myrtek et al. (2004)
demonstrated that IL13 and IL4 have inhibitory effects on IL13RA1
expression on eosinophils, while IFNG (147570), TNFA (191160), and,
particularly, TGFB (190180) enhance IL13RA1 expression. The positive
regulatory responses evoked by TGFB and IFNG did not, however, prevent
the inhibitory effects of IL13. Myrtek et al. (2004) concluded that
there is a cytokine regulatory network influencing the reactivity of
eosinophils to IL13.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

LaPorte et al. (2008) reported the crystal structures of the complete
set of IL4 and IL13 type I (IL4RA/IL2RG/IL4) and type II
(IL4RA/IL13RA1/IL4 and IL4RA/IL13RA1/IL13) ternary signaling complexes
at the 3.0-angstrom level. They noted that the type I receptor complex
is more active in regulating Th2 development, whereas the type II
receptor complex is not found on T cells and is more active in
regulating cells that mediate airway hypersensitivity and mucus
secretion. The type I complex revealed a structural basis for the
ability of IL2RG to recognize 6 different IL2RG cytokines.

MAPPING

Aman et al. (1996) demonstrated the X-linkage of IL13RA by analysis of a
panel of 24 DNA samples from mostly monochromosomal somatic hybrids. An
IL13RA-specific band of 148 bp was amplified reproducibly from 2
hybrids, one containing only human chromosome X and the other containing
both human chromosomes 1 and X.

Guo et al. (1997) mapped the IL13RA gene to chromosome Xq24 by in situ
hybridization. It lies between 2 other cytokine receptor genes: IL2RG on
Xq13.1 and the interleukin-9 receptor gene (IL9R; 300007) on Xq28. The
lack of nucleotide sequence similarity suggests unrelated evolutionary
pathways between these receptor genes.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Heinzmann et al. (2000) determined that R130Q variant of human IL13
(147683.0002), which they referred to as R110Q, associated with asthma
in case-control populations from Britain and Japan (peak odds ratio (OR)
= 2.31, 95% confidence interval, 1.33 - 4.00); the variant also
predicted asthma and higher serum IL13 levels in a general, Japanese
pediatric population. A noncoding variant of IL13RA1, 1398A-G,
associated primarily with high IgE levels (OR = 3.38 in males, 1.10 in
females) rather than asthma.

605401	TITLE *605401 IQ MOTIF-CONTAINING GTPase-ACTIVATING PROTEIN 2; IQGAP2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) accelerate the intrinsic GTPase
activity of Ras proteins, resulting in conversion of these GTPases from
their active GTP-bound form to the inactive GDP-bound form (see 139150).
IQ motif-containing GAP1 (IQGAP1; 603379) was identified based on its
homology to a RasGAP homolog from S. pombe, Sar1. Brill et al. (1996)
identified IQGAP2 by screening a mouse brain cDNA library with a human
IQGAP1 probe at low stringency. Human IQGAP2 cDNA clones were then
isolated from liver cDNA libraries. The assembled full-length sequence
encodes a 1,575-amino acid protein that is 62% identical to IQGAP1 and
contains all domains previously identified in IQGAP1. These domains
include a calponin homology (CH) domain, which is present in several
actin-binding proteins; an IQGAP repeat domain containing 5 copies of a
novel 50- to 55-amino acid repeat; a WW putative protein interaction
domain; and 4 IQ motifs implicated in calmodulin (CALM1; 114180)
binding. Like IQGAP1, IQGAP2 has several segments that have a high
probability of forming coiled-coil structures similar to those in myosin
heavy chains and intermediate filament proteins. IQGAP1 and IQGAP2 also
share 25% amino acid identity with Sar1 over a 700-amino acid region.
Northern blot analysis detected expression of an IQGAP2 transcript in
mouse liver and of a shorter transcript in mouse testis. IQGAP2
expression was also detected in human hepatoblastoma and hepatocellular
carcinoma cell lines, suggesting that IQGAP2 is expressed within
hepatocytes in the liver.

GENE FUNCTION

By transfection and coprecipitation experiments, Brill et al. (1996)
demonstrated that IQGAP2 bound CALM1 and that this binding required the
IQ motifs of IQGAP2. IQGAP2 also bound the GTPases CDC42 (116952) and
RAC1 (602048) through its C terminus, but it showed no evidence of GAP
activity toward them.

MAPPING

By Southern blot analysis of somatic cell hybrid DNA, Brill et al.
(1996) mapped the IQGAP2 gene to chromosome 5q11-q13.

605255	TITLE *605255 ETS VARIANT GENE 7; ETV7
;;ETS TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR TEL2; TEL2;;
TELB
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The ETS (E26 transformation-specific) family of transcription factors,
of which ETV7 is a member, is a large group of evolutionarily conserved
transcriptional regulators that play an important role in a variety of
cellular processes throughout development and differentiation, and are
involved in oncogenesis as well (Potter et al., 2000).

CLONING

Potter et al. (2000) sequenced cDNA clones corresponding to a novel ETS
gene from an activated T-cell cDNA library, as well as from breast
tissue and meningioma cDNA libraries. The cDNA, which the authors
designated TEL2, encodes a deduced 341-amino acid protein that shares
38% sequence identity with TEL1 (ETV6; 600618). TEL2 contains a
C-terminal ETS domain and an N-terminal PNT domain, which is thought to
mediate protein-protein interactions. Northern blot analysis revealed
expression of TEL2 mRNA predominantly in hematopoietic tissues; a
predominant band of approximately 1.2 kb was present in fetal liver and
bone marrow and was faintly present in peripheral blood leukocytes.
Using antibodies raised against the C terminus of the TEL2 protein,
Potter et al. (2000) showed that TEL2 localizes to the nucleus. The
striking similarities of TEL2 to TEL1, its expression in hematopoietic
tissues, and its ability to associate with TEL1 suggested that TEL2 may
be an important hematopoietic regulatory protein.

Poirel et al. (2000) identified the TELB gene by comparison of the TEL
sequence with genomic sequence databases. Northern blot analysis
detected ubiquitous expression of TELB.

GENE STRUCTURE

Potter et al. (2000) determined that the TEL2 gene contains 8 exons
spanning approximately 21 kb.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization and by inclusion within a PAC
clone, Potter et al. (2000) mapped the TEL2 gene to chromosome 6p21.

Poirel et al. (2000) mapped the TELB gene to 6p21 by genomic sequence
analysis.

603255	TITLE *603255 NUCLEAR TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR, X BOX-BINDING, 1; NFX1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Expression of class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules
is usually restricted to cells of the immune system and dysregulated
expression is thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of a severe
combined immunodeficiency syndrome and certain autoimmune diseases. See
RFX5 (601863). MHC class II gene expression is controlled primarily at
the transcriptional level by transcription factors that bind to the X
and Y boxes, 2 highly conserved elements in the proximal promoter of MHC
class II genes. The X box is further subdivided into an upstream X1 box
and an X2 box.

CLONING

Raji cells are an EBV-transformed human B lymphoblastoid cell line that
expresses MHC class II molecules. By screening a Raji cell cDNA
expression library for the ability to bind oligonucleotides that contain
X box sequences, Song et al. (1994) isolated NFX1 cDNAs. The predicted
1,104-amino acid protein has a central cysteine-rich DNA-binding domain
that is subdivided into 7 repeated motifs; the motif is similar to, but
distinct from, LIM (see 601999) and RING finger (see 602045) domains.
Two acidic regions surround the cysteine-rich domain. Northern blot
analysis revealed that NFX1 was expressed as an approximately 4-kb mRNA.
Using RT-PCR and an RNase protection assay, Song et al. (1994) found
NFX1 expression in all cell lines tested, regardless of the MHC class II
phenotype.

Arlotta et al. (2002) cloned the mouse homolog of NFX1. The N and C
termini of the mouse protein share 70% and 88% homology with those of
the human protein, respectively, and mouse Nfx1 contains the conserved
central cysteine-rich DNA-binding motif, which is 95% homologous to that
of the human protein. Arlotta et al. (2002) noted that other studies
identified an important role for NFX1 in neuronal development.

GENE FUNCTION

Song et al. (1994) showed that recombinant NFX1 bound specifically to
the X1 boxes of HLA-DRA (142860) and other MHC class II genes in vitro.
Overexpression of NFX1 specifically repressed transcription of HLA-DRA.
Song et al. (1994) concluded that NFX1 is a potent and biologically
relevant repressor of HLA-DRA transcription.

MAPPING

Arlotta et al. (2002) mapped the mouse Nfx1 gene to the proximal region
of chromosome 4 by interspecific backcross analysis. By homology of
synteny, genomic sequence analysis, and other methods, they mapped the
human NFX1 gene to chromosome 9p13 in close proximity to the CNTFR gene
(118946).

;;VALACYCLOVIRASE;;
MUCIN-ASSOCIATED ANTIGEN; MCNAA;;
BREAST EPITHELIAL MUCIN-ASSOCIATED ANTIGEN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The serine hydrolases, including BPHL, are defined as a functional class
of hydrolytic enzymes that contain a serine residue in their active
site. They can be grouped into subfamilies that contain closely related
members in terms of substrate specificity or amino acid sequence
similarity (Puente and Lopez-Otin, 1995).

CLONING

By immunoscreening an expression library prepared from human lactating
breast tissue, Larocca et al. (1990) obtained a partial BPHL cDNA, which
they called BA70-1. Northern blot analysis detected a major 1.8-kb
transcript and a minor 0.65-kb transcript in human breast tumor cell
lines and several other carcinoma cell lines.

Puente and Lopez-Otin (1995) isolated a full-length human breast
carcinoma cDNA encoding a novel serine hydrolase, BPHL. The deduced
274-amino acid protein shows significant sequence similarity to
prokaryotic enzymes involved in the degradation of aromatic compounds;
the highest identities, about 25%, are to 4 serine hydrolases encoded by
the bphD genes of different strains of Pseudomonas, all of which degrade
biphenyl derivatives. Recombinant BPHL protein demonstrated serine
hydrolase activity that was abolished by a covalent inhibitor of serine
hydrolases. By Northern blot analysis of human tissues, the authors
detected a major 1.8-kb BPHL transcript, with highest levels in liver
and kidney, and a minor 2.4-kb transcript. They showed that BPHL is
expressed as an approximately 30-kD protein in human liver using Western
blot analysis.

GENE FUNCTION

Valacyclovir (VACV) is the 5-prime valyl ester prodrug of acyclovir, an
effective antiherpetic drug. VACV is relatively stable in gut lumen
while very susceptible to intracellular enzymatic hydrolysis. Kim et al.
(2003) found that the VACV hydrolase associated with human colon
carcinoma cell membranes is BPHL. Gel filtration chromatography detected
the enzyme at an apparent molecular mass of 27 kD. Hydrolysis of VACV by
recombinant BPHL was concentration-dependent, showed highest activity in
the pH range of 7.4 to 8.0, and was sensitive to serine hydrolase
inhibitors and a free thiol modifier, suggesting that cysteines as well
as serines have a role in the catalytic function of BPHL.

GENE STRUCTURE

Puente et al. (1998) determined that the BPHL gene spans approximately
30 kb and contains 8 exons.

MAPPING

By FISH, Puente et al. (1998) localized the BPHL gene to chromosome
6p25.

604226	TITLE *604226 ACTIN-RELATED PROTEIN 2/3 COMPLEX, SUBUNIT 4; ARPC4
;;ACTIN-RELATED PROTEIN 2/3 COMPLEX, 20-KD SUBUNIT; ARC20;;
p20-ARC
DESCRIPTION The Arp2/3 protein complex has been implicated in the control of actin
polymerization in cells. The human complex consists of 7 subunits: the
actin-related proteins ARP2 (ACTR2; 604221) and ARP3 (ACTR3; 604222),
ARC41 (ARPC1B; 604223), ARC34 (ARPC2; 604224), ARC21 (ARPC3; 604225),
ARC20 (ARPC4), and ARC16 (ARPC5; 604227). See ACTR2 for additional
information about the Arp2/3 complex.

CLONING

By searching an EST database with peptide sequences from the 7 subunits
of the human ARP2/3 complex, Welch et al. (1997) identified full-length
human cDNAs encoding each subunit. The ARC20 cDNA encodes a deduced
168-amino acid protein that is 68% and 67% identical to its homologs in
S. pombe and S. cerevisiae, respectively.

Machesky et al. (1997) purified the ARP2/3 complex from human
neutrophils and sequenced peptides from each of the subunits.

GENE FUNCTION

Volkmann et al. (2001) performed electron cryomicroscopy and
3-dimensional reconstruction of Acanthamoeba castellanii and S.
cerevisiae Arp2/3 complexes bound to the WASP (301000) carboxy-terminal
domain. Asymmetric, oblate ellipsoids were revealed. Image analysis of
actin branches indicated that the complex binds the side of the mother
filament, and ARP2 and ARP3 are the first 2 subunits of the daughter
filament. Comparison to the actin-free WASP-activated complexes suggests
that branch initiation involves large-scale structural rearrangements
within ARP2/3.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Robinson et al. (2001) determined the crystal structure of bovine ARP2/3
complex at 2.0-angstrom resolution. ARP2 and ARP3 are folded like actin,
with distinctive surface features. Subunits ARPC2 and ARPC4 in the core
of the complex associate through long carboxy-terminal alpha helices and
have similarly folded amino-terminal alpha/beta domains. ARPC1 is a
7-blade beta propeller with an insertion that may associate with the
side of an actin filament. ARPC3 and ARPC5 are globular alpha-helical
subunits. Robinson et al. (2001) predicted that WASP/SCAR proteins
activate ARP2/3 complex by bringing ARP2 into proximity with ARP3 for
nucleation of a branch on the side of a preexisting actin filament.

BASIC FIBROBLAST GROWTH FACTOR-INDUCED GENE IN GASTRIC CANCER; FIGC
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Li et al. (2003) cloned 2 splice variants of mouse Kcmf1, which they
called Debt91, from a mouse heart cDNA library. The deduced proteins
contain 331 and 381 amino acids and differ at their N termini. The
full-length protein is serine and threonine rich and has a cysteine- and
histidine-rich N terminus that is predicted to form zinc fingers. It
also has a bipartite nuclear localization signal, 3 possible
glycosylation sites, and multiple potential phosphorylation sites.
Northern blot analysis detected 2 transcripts in adult mouse heart,
skeletal muscle, and kidney, but only the smaller transcript was
expressed in liver and testis. No significant expression was detected in
brain, spleen, and lung. The smaller transcript was highly expressed
throughout mouse embryonic development, with high expression after day
15. Database analysis revealed high conservation of the DEBT91 protein
among human, mouse, fly, snail, and worm, particularly at the N-terminal
end.

By differential screening for basic FGF (FGF2; 134920)-inducible genes
in SNU-16 gastric cancer cells, followed by 5-prime and 3-prime RACE of
a brain cDNA library, Jang (2004) cloned human KCMF1, which he called
FIGC. The deduced 381-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass
of 42 kD. It has an N-terminal C6H2-type RING finger domain and a
proline-rich C terminus. The ring finger domain of FIGC has an
acidic-rich spacer region. Northern blot analysis detected FIGC
expression in human spleen, small intestine, ovary, peripheral blood,
lung, skeletal muscle, kidney, and pancreas, with much lower expression
in thymus, prostate, testis, colon, heart, brain, placenta, and liver.

GENE FUNCTION

Jang (2004) found that basic FGF induced expression of FIGC in SNU-16
human gastric cancer cells. Recombinant FIGC functioned as a
ubiquitin-protein ligase in the presence of ATP, ubiquitin (191339),
recombinant rabbit E1 (see 314370), and the E2 enzyme UBCH5B (602962),
resulting in FIGC polyubiquitination.

Beilke et al. (2010) observed upregulated nuclear KCMF1 expression in
pancreatic cancers and several other adenocarcinomas. Overexpression of
KCMF1 in HEK293 cells resulted in elevated cell proliferation,
migration, and formation of tumor nodules in vivo.

MAPPING

Hartz (2012) mapped the KCMF1 gene to chromosome 2p11.2 based on the
alignment of the KCMF1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF155652) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

Li et al. (2003) mapped the mouse Kcmf1 gene to a region of chromosome 6
that shares homology of synteny with human chromosome 2p11.2.

ANIMAL MODEL

Beilke et al. (2010) developed a line of mice with reduced Kcmf1
expression. Knockdown of Kcmf1 reduced development of TGF-alpha (TGFA;
190170)-dependent tumors compared with controls.

613004	TITLE *613004 HUNTINGTIN; HTT
;;IT15;;
HD GENE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The HTT gene encodes huntingtin, a ubiquitously expressed nuclear
protein that binds to a number of transcription factors to regulate
transcription. Abnormal expansion of a polyglutamine tract in the N
terminus of huntingtin causes Huntington disease (143100), a devastating
autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor,
psychiatric, and cognitive dysfunction (summary by Futter et al., 2009).

CLONING

By positional cloning and exon amplification of the Huntington disease
(HD; 143100) locus on chromosome 4p16.3, the Huntington's Disease
Collaborative Research Group (1993) identified a novel transcript,
designated IT15 (important transcript 15), from human retinal and
frontal cortex cDNA libraries. The corresponding gene was predicted to
encode a 3,144-residue protein with a molecular mass of 348 kD. The
protein was called 'huntingtin' (HTT) (Hoogeveen et al., 1993). Northern
blot analysis detected a 10 to 11-kb transcript in a variety of human
tissues. The reading frame was found to contain a polymorphic
trinucleotide repeat varying from 11 to 34 CAG copies in normal
individuals. This repeat was expanded to a range of 42 to over 66 copies
(613004.0001) in 1 allele from patients with Huntington disease.

Lee et al. (2002) identified an upstream open reading frame (uORF)
encoding a 21-amino acid peptide within the 5-prime UTR of the
huntingtin gene. This upstream ORF negatively influenced expression from
the huntingtin mRNA, perhaps by limiting ribosomal access to downstream
initiation sites.

Barnes et al. (1994) found that mouse Htt (It15, Hdh) shares 86% and 91%
sequence identity with human HTT DNA and protein, respectively. Despite
the overall high level of conservation, the murine gene possesses an
imperfect CAG repeat encoding only 7 consecutive glutamines, compared to
the 13 to 36 residues that are normal in the human. Although no evidence
for polymorphic variation of the CAG repeat was seen in mice, a nearby
CCG repeat differed in length by 1 unit between several strains of
laboratory mouse and Mus spretus. The absence of a long CAG repeat in
the mouse was consistent with the lack of a spontaneous mouse model of
HD.

Baxendale et al. (1995) cloned and sequenced the homolog of the HTT gene
in the pufferfish, Fugu rubripes.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ambrose et al. (1994) found that the HTT gene spans 180 kb and contains
67 exons ranging in size from 48 bp to 341 bp with an average of 138 bp.

Lin et al. (1995) presented a detailed comparison of the sequence of the
putative promoter and the organization of the 5-prime genomic region
encompassing the first 5 exons of the mouse Htt and human HTT genes.
They found 2 dinucleotide (CT) and 1 trinucleotide intronic polymorphism
in Htt and an intronic CA polymorphism in HTT. A comparison of 940-bp
sequence 5-prime to the putative translation start site revealed a
highly conserved region (78.8% nucleotide identity) between the Htt and
the HTT gene from mouse nucleotide -56 to -206.

Baxendale et al. (1995) found that the Fugu HTT homolog spans only 23 kb
of genomic DNA, compared to the 170-kb human gene, and yet all 67 exons
are conserved. The first exon, the site of the disease-causing triplet
repeat in the human, is highly conserved. However, the glutamine repeat
in Fugu consists of only 4 residues. Baxendale et al. (1995) also showed
that synteny may be conserved over longer stretches of the 2 genomes.
The work described a detailed example of sequence comparison between
human and Fugu and illustrated the power of the pufferfish genome as a
model system in the analysis of human genes.

MAPPING

The human HTT gene maps to chromosome 4p16.3 (Huntington's Disease
Collaborative Research Group, 1993).

- Mouse Gene

Using DNA markers near the Huntington disease gene on 4p, Cheng et al.
(1989) defined a conserved linkage group on mouse chromosome 5. By
linkage analyses using recombinant inbred strains, a standard outcross,
and an interspecific backcross, they assigned homologs of 4 anonymous
DNA segments and the QDPR gene (612676) to mouse chromosome 5 and
determined their relationship to previously mapped markers on that
autosome. The findings suggested that the murine counterpart of the HD
gene may lie between Hx and Emv1. Hx stands for hemimelia-extra toes;
the gene lies 6 cM distal to Emv1, an endogenous ecotropic provirus.

From studies of the comparative mapping of the 4p16.3 region in man and
mouse, Altherr et al. (1992) concluded that the homolog of the HD gene
should be located on mouse chromosome 5. Nasir et al. (1994) confirmed
this conclusion by using an interspecific backcross to map the murine
homolog of IT15 (Hdh) to an area of mouse chromosome 5 that is within
the region of conserved synteny with human chromosome 4p16.3. Near the
unstable CAG repeat encoding a stretch of polyglutamine that is involved
in the pathogenesis of HD, there is a polyproline-encoding CCG repeat
that shows more limited allelic variation. Barnes et al. (1994) used the
mouse homolog, Hdh, to map the gene to mouse chromosome 5 in a region
devoid of mutations causing any comparable phenotype.

Grosson et al. (1994) localized the mouse homologs of the HD gene and 17
other human chromosome 4 loci, including 6 previously unmapped genes, by
use of an interspecific cross. All loci mapped in a continuous linkage
group on mouse chromosome 5, distal to En2 (engrailed-2; 131310) and Il6
(interleukin-6; 147620), the human counterparts of which are located on
chromosome 7. The relative order of the loci on human chromosome 4 and
mouse chromosome 5 was maintained for the most part. Grosson et al.
(1994) knew of no phenotypic correspondence between human and mouse
mutations mapping to this region of syntenic conservation. The gene that
is mutant in achondroplasia (100800), namely, fibroblast growth factor
receptor-3 (FGFR3; 134934), was not among the genes mapped.

Lin et al. (1995) cloned the mouse Htt gene and showed that it maps to
mouse chromosome 5 within a region of conserved synteny with human
4p16.3.

GENE FUNCTION

Hoogeveen et al. (1993) synthesized oligopeptides corresponding to the
C-terminal end of the predicted HD gene product. Immunobiochemical
studies with polyclonal antibodies directed against this synthetic
peptide revealed the presence of a protein, called huntingtin by them,
with a molecular mass of approximately 330 kD in lymphoblastoid cells
from normal individuals and patients with Huntington disease.
Immunocytochemical studies showed a cytoplasmic localization in various
cell types, including neurons. In most of the neuronal cells, the
protein was also present in the nucleus. No difference in molecular mass
or intracellular localization was found between normal and mutant cells.

Dure et al. (1994) examined the in situ hybridization of riboprobes
specific for the IT15 gene against normal human fetal and adult brains.
In both types of specimen, the autoradiographic signal correlated
strongly with cell number except in the germinal matrix and white matter
where there is a significant proportion of glial cells. This suggested
that IT15 expression is predominantly neuronal. However, there was no
predominance of IT15 expression in the striatum of the fetal brain.

The wide expression of the HTT transcript does not correlate with the
pattern of neuropathology in the disease. To study the huntingtin
protein, Trottier et al. (1995) generated monoclonal antibodies against
4 different regions of the protein. On Western blots, these monoclonals
detected the huntingtin protein of approximately 350 kD in various human
cell lines and in neural and nonneural rodent tissues. A doublet protein
was detected in cell lines from HD patients, corresponding to the mutant
and normal huntingtin. Immunohistochemical studies in the human brain,
using 2 of these antibodies, detected huntingtin in perikarya of some
neurons, neuropils, and varicosities. Huntingtin was also visualized as
punctate staining likely to represent nerve endings.

Gutekunst et al. (1995) used both polyclonal and monoclonal antifusion
protein antibodies to identify native huntingtin in rat, monkey, and
human. Western blots revealed a protein with the expected molecular
weight that is present in the soluble fraction of rat and monkey brain
tissues and lymphoblastoid cell lines from control cases.
Immunocytochemistry indicated that huntingtin is located in neurons
throughout the brain, with the highest levels evident in larger neurons.
In the human striatum, huntingtin was enriched in a patch-like
distribution, potentially corresponding to the first areas affected in
HD. Subcellular localization of huntingtin was consistent with a
cytosolic protein primarily found in somatodendritic regions. Huntingtin
appears to be associated particularly with microtubules, although some
is also associated with synaptic vesicles. On the basis of the
localization of huntingtin in association with microtubules, Gutekunst
et al. (1995) speculated that the mutation impairs the cytoskeletal
anchoring or transport of mitochondria, vesicles, or other organelles or
molecules. Lymphoblastoid cell lines from juvenile-onset heterozygote HD
cases showed expression of both normal and mutant huntingtin; increasing
repeat expansion leads to lower levels of the mutant protein.

Li et al. (1995) described a huntingtin-associated protein (HAP1;
600947), which is enriched in brain. The authors found that binding of
HAP1 to huntingtin was enhanced by an expanded polyglutamine repeat.

De Rooij et al. (1996) used affinity-purified antibodies to analyze the
subcellular location of huntingtin. In mouse embryonic fibroblasts,
human skin fibroblasts, and mouse neuroblastoma cells, they detected
huntingtin in the cytoplasm and the nucleus.

Burke et al. (1996) described the isolation of a protein present in
brain homogenates that bound to a synthetic 60-glutamine peptide (such
as that found in huntingtin). Eighteen amino acids of this protein were
found to be identical to the N terminus of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (GAPD, or GAPDH; 138400). GAPD was also found to bind to
another protein with a polyglutamine tract, namely the DRPLA protein,
atrophin-1 (607462). Burke et al. (1996) demonstrated that synthetic
polyglutamine peptides, DRPLA protein, and huntingtin from unaffected
individuals with normal-sized polyglutamine tracts bind to GAPD. GAPD
had also been shown to bind to RNA, ATP, calcyclin (114110), actin (see
102610), tubulin (see 191130) and amyloid precursor protein (104760). On
the basis of their findings, the authors postulated that disease
characterized by the presence of an expanded CAG repeat, which share a
common mode of heritability, may also share a common metabolic
pathogenesis involving GAPD as a functional component. Both Roses (1996)
and Barinaga (1996) reviewed these findings.

In human lymphoblastoid cells, Kahlem et al. (1998) showed that
huntingtin is a substrate of transglutaminase (see, e.g., TGM1; 190195)
in vitro and that the rate constant of the reaction increases with
length of the polyglutamine over a range of an order of magnitude. As a
result, huntingtin with expanded polyglutamine is preferentially
incorporated into polymers. Both disappearance of huntingtin with
expanded polyglutamine and its replacement by polymeric forms are
prevented by inhibitors of transglutaminase. The effect of
transglutaminase therefore duplicates the changes in the affected parts
of the brain. In the presence of either tissue or brain
transglutaminase, monomeric huntingtin bearing a polyglutamine expansion
formed polymers much more rapidly than one with a short polyglutamine
sequence.

Zuccato et al. (2001) demonstrated that wildtype huntingtin upregulates
transcription of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF; 113505), a
prosurvival factor produced by cortical neurons that is necessary for
survival of striatal neurons in the brain. Zuccato et al. (2001) showed
that this beneficial activity of huntingtin is lost when the protein
becomes mutated, resulting in decreased production of cortical BDNF.
This leads to insufficient neurotrophic support for striatal neurons,
which then die. Zuccato et al. (2001) suggested that restoring wildtype
huntingtin activity and increasing BDNF production may be therapeutic
approaches for treating HD.

Kegel et al. (2002) demonstrated localization of huntingtin to
subnuclear compartments, including speckles, promyelocytic leukemia
protein bodies, and nucleoli, in normal and HD human fibroblasts and in
mouse neurons. Western blot analysis showed that purified nuclei had low
levels of full-length huntingtin compared with the cytoplasm, but
contained high levels of N- and C-terminal huntingtin fragments, which
tightly bound to the nuclear matrix. Full-length huntingtin
coimmunoprecipitated with the transcriptional CTBP1 (602618) protein,
and polyglutamine expansion in huntingtin reduced this interaction.
Full-length wildtype and mutant huntingtin repressed transcription when
targeted to DNA, but truncated N-terminal wildtype huntingtin did not,
suggesting that proteolysis of huntingtin in the nucleus may normally
occur in cells to terminate or modulate huntingtin function. However,
truncated N-terminal mutant huntingtin retained the ability to repress
transcription, suggesting an abnormal gain of function. Kegel et al.
(2002) suggested that wildtype huntingtin may function in the nucleus in
the assembly of nuclear matrix-bound protein complexes involved with
transcriptional repression and RNA processing. Proteolysis of mutant
huntingtin may disrupt nuclear functions by altering protein complex
interactions and inappropriately repressing transcription in HD.

By live-cell time-lapse video microscopy, Xia et al. (2003) visualized
polyglutamine-mediated aggregation and transient nuclear localization of
huntingtin over time in a striatal cell line. A classic nuclear
localization signal could not be detected in the huntingtin amino acid
sequence, but a nuclear export signal (NES) in the carboxy terminus of
huntingtin was discovered. Leptomycin B treatment of clonal striatal
cells enhanced the nuclear localization of huntingtin, and a mutant NES
huntingtin displayed increased nuclear localization, indicating that
huntingtin can shuttle to and from the nucleus. The huntingtin NES is
strictly conserved among all huntingtin proteins from diverse species.
This export signal may be important in Huntington disease because this
fragment of huntingtin is proteolytically cleaved during HD.

Zuccato et al. (2003) showed that the neuron-restrictive silencer
element (NRSE) is the target of wildtype huntingtin activity on BDNF
promoter II. Wildtype huntingtin inhibits the silencing activity of the
NRSE, increasing transcription of BDNF. Zuccato et al. (2003) showed
that this effect occurs through cytoplasmic sequestering of repressor
element-1 transcription factor/neuron-restrictive silencer factor
(REST/NRSF; 600571), the transcription factor that binds to NRSE. In
contrast, aberrant accumulation of REST/NRSF in the nucleus is present
in Huntington disease. Wildtype huntingtin coimmunoprecipitates with
REST/NRSF, and less immunoprecipitated material is found in brain tissue
with Huntington disease. Zuccato et al. (2003) also reported that
wildtype huntingtin acts as a positive transcriptional regulator for
other NRSE-containing genes involved in the maintenance of the neuronal
phenotype. Consistently, loss of expression of NRSE-controlled neuronal
genes was shown in cells, mice, and human brain with Huntington disease.
Zuccato et al. (2003) concluded that wildtype huntingtin acts in the
cytoplasm of neurons to regulate the availability of REST/NRSF to its
nuclear NRSE-binding site and that this control is lost in the pathology
of Huntington disease. The findings indicated a novel mechanism by which
mutation of huntingtin causes loss of transcription of neuronal genes.

Gauthier et al. (2004) showed that huntingtin specifically enhances
vesicular transport of BDNF along microtubules. They determined that
huntingtin-mediated transport involves HAP1 and the p150(Glued) (601143)
subunit of dynactin, an essential component of molecular motors. BDNF
transport was attenuated both in the disease context and by reducing the
levels of wildtype huntingtin. The alteration of the
huntingtin/HAP1/p150(Glued) complex correlated with reduced association
of motor proteins with microtubules. The
polyglutamine-huntingtin-induced transport deficit resulted in the loss
of neurotrophic support and neuronal toxicity. Gauthier et al. (2004)
concluded that a key role of huntingtin is to promote BDNF transport and
suggested that loss of this function might contribute to pathogenesis.

By yeast 1-hybrid and DNase footprint analyses, Tanaka et al. (2004)
identified 2 proteins, HDBP1 (SLC2A4RG; 609493) and HDBP2 (ZNF395;
609494), that bound a 7-bp consensus sequence (GCCGGCG) in the HTT
promoter. Mutation of the 7-bp consensus sequence abolished HTT promoter
function in a human neuronal cell line.

Using an antibody specific for HTT phosphorylated on ser421, Warby et
al. (2005) demonstrated that HTT phosphorylation was present at
significant levels under normal physiologic conditions in human and
mouse brain. Htt phosphorylation showed a regional distribution with
highest levels in the cerebellum, less in the cortex, and least in the
striatum. In cell cultures and in YAC transgenic mice, endogenous
phosphorylation of polyglutamine-expanded HTT was significantly reduced
relative to wildtype HTT. The presence and pattern of significant HTT
phosphorylation in the brain suggested to the authors that this dynamic
posttranslational modification may be important for the regulation of
HTT and may contribute to the selective neurodegeneration seen in HD.

Ralser et al. (2005) demonstrated that ataxin-2 (601517) interacted with
endophilin-A1 (SH3GL2; 604465) and endophilin-A3 (SH3GL3; 603362). In a
yeast model system, expression of ataxin-2 as well as both endophilin
proteins was toxic for yeast lacking Sac6, which encodes fimbrin (PLS3;
300131), a protein involved in actin filament organization and
endocytotic processes. Expression of huntingtin was also toxic in
Sac6-null yeast. These effects could be suppressed by simultaneous
expression of 1 of the 2 human fimbrin orthologs, L-plastin (LCP1;
153430) or T-plastin (PLS3). Ataxin-2 associated with L- and T-plastin,
and overexpression of ataxin-2 led to accumulation of T-plastin in
mammalian cells. Ralser et al. (2005) suggested an interplay between
ataxin-2, endophilin proteins, and huntingtin in plastin-associated
cellular pathways.

Cornett et al. (2005) studied the mechanism by which mutant HTT
accumulates in the nucleus; wildtype HTT is normally found in the
cytoplasm. They reported that N-terminal HTT shuttles between the
cytoplasm and nucleus and that small N-terminal HTT fragments interact
with the nuclear pore protein translocated promoter region (TPR;
189940), which is involved in nuclear export. PolyQ expansion and
aggregation decrease this interaction and increase the nuclear
accumulation of HTT. Reducing the expression of TPR by RNA interference
or deletion of 10 amino acids of N-terminal HTT, which are essential for
the interaction of HTT with TPR, increased the nuclear accumulation of
HTT. Cornett et al. (2005) concluded that TPR has a role in the nuclear
export of N-terminal HTT and that polyQ expansion reduces this nuclear
export to cause the nuclear accumulation of HTT.

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis of a human brain cDNA library and affinity
chromatography assays with mouse brain cytosol, Caviston et al. (2007)
demonstrated that Htt and dynein intermediate chain (see DYNC1I1;
603772) interacted directly. HTT RNA interference in HeLa cells resulted
in Golgi disruption similar to the effects of compromised
dynein/dynactin function. In vitro studies revealed that Htt and dynein
were both present on vesicles purified from mouse brain. Antibodies to
Htt inhibited vesicular transport along microtubules, suggesting that
Htt facilitates dynein-mediated vesicle motility. In vivo inhibition of
dynein function resulted in a significant redistribution of Htt to the
cell periphery, suggesting that dynein transports Htt-associated
vesicles toward the cell center.

Argonaute proteins, such as AGO1 (EIF2C1; 606228) and AGO2 (EIF2C2;
606229), are components of a ribonucleoprotein complex that regulates
mRNA translation via small interfering RNA. Savas et al. (2008) found
that an N-terminal fragment of Htt with 25 or 97 glutamines
immunoprecipitated AGO1 and AGO2 from transfected HeLa cells. AGO2 also
immunoprecipitated endogenous HTT from HeLa cells. A portion of
endogenous HTT colocalized with AGO2 in P bodies in human and mouse cell
lines and in primary rat hippocampal neurons, but not all HTT foci
colocalized with AGO2 and a P-body marker. Small interfering RNA,
reporter gene assays, and FRAP analysis suggested that HTT may have a
role in gene silencing through the RNA interference pathway, and that
mutant HTT may reduce incorporation of AGO2 into P bodies and P
body-associated gene silencing.

Futter et al. (2009) found that wildtype huntingtin could bind to a
number of nuclear receptors, including LXR-alpha (NR1H3; 602423), PPARG
(601487), VDR (601769), and THRA1 (190120). Overexpression of huntingtin
activated, whereas knockout of huntingtin decreased, LXR-mediated
transcription of a reporter gene. Loss of huntingtin also decreased
expression of the LXR target gene, ABCA1 (600046). In vivo,
huntingtin-deficient zebrafish had a severe phenotype with reduction of
cartilage in the jaw and reduced expression of LXR-regulated genes. An
LXR agonist was able to partially rescue the phenotype and the
expression of LXR target genes in huntingtin-deficient zebrafish during
early development. The data suggested a novel function for wildtype
huntingtin as a cofactor of LXR. However, this activity was lost by
mutant polyQ huntingtin, which only interacted weakly with LXR.

Smith et al. (2009) showed that mutant huntingtin disrupted
intracellular transport and insulin secretion by direct interference
with microtubular beta-tubulin (TUBB; 191130). Mutant huntingtin
impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in insulin-producing beta
cells, without altering stored levels of insulin. Mutant huntingtin also
retarded post-Golgi transport, and the speed of insulin vesicle
trafficking was reduced. There was an enhanced and aberrant interaction
between mutant huntingtin and beta-tubulin, implying the underlying
mechanism of impaired intracellular transport. Smith et al. (2009)
proposed a novel pathogenetic process by which mutant huntingtin may
disrupt hormone exocytosis from beta cells and possibly impair vesicular
transport in any cell that expresses the pathogenic protein.

Seong et al. (2010) investigated huntingtin's domain structure and
potential intersection with epigenetic silencer polycomb repressive
complex-2 (PRC2, see EZH1; 601674), suggested by shared embryonic
deficiency phenotypes. Analysis of a set of full-length recombinant
huntingtins, with different polyglutamine regions, demonstrated dramatic
conformational flexibility, with an accessible hinge separating 2 large
alpha-helical domains. Mouse embryos lacking huntingtin exhibited
impaired PRC2 regulation of Hox gene expression, trophoblast giant cell
differentiation, paternal X-chromosome inactivation, and histone H3K27
trimethylation, while full-length endogenous nuclear huntingtin in
wildtype embryoid bodies was associated with PRC2 subunits and was
detected with trimethylated histone H3K27 at Hoxb9 (142964). Supporting
a direct stimulatory role, full-length recombinant huntingtin
significantly increased the histone H3K27 trimethylase activity of
reconstituted PRC2 in vitro, and structure-function analysis
demonstrated that the polyglutamine region augmented full-length
huntingtin PRC2 stimulation, both in Hdh(Q111) embryoid bodies and in
vitro, with reconstituted PRC2. Seong et al. (2010) implicated a role
for the multisubunit PRC2 complex in neurodegenerative disorders such as
Huntington disease.

Song et al. (2011) found fragmented mitochondria in fibroblasts from a
patient with HD and in rat cortical neurons expressing human HTT with a
polyQ expansion. Neurons expressing mutant HTT also showed arrest in
mitochondrial movement and ultrastructural changes in mitochondrial
cristae. Mitochondrial changes were observed in a mouse model of HD
prior to emergence of neurologic deficits, neuronal cell death, and HTT
aggregate formation. Immunoprecipitation of normal and HD human or mouse
brain indicated that mutant, but not normal, huntingtin interacted with
Drp1 (DNM1; 603850), a protein involved in mitochondria and peroxisome
fission. In vitro assays with liposomes that mimicked the mitochondrial
outer membrane revealed that mutant huntingtin stimulated Drp1 GTPase
activity. Expression of a dominant-negative Drp1 mutant rescued mutant
huntingtin-mediated mitochondrial fragmentation, defects in
mitochondrial transport, and neuronal cell death. Electron microscopy
showed that the normal ring- and spiral-like organization of DRP1
oligomers had an additional layer of density with the addition of
mutant, but not normal, huntingtin.

Neurodegeneration in HD is thought to be due to proteolytic release of
toxic peptide fragments from mutant HTT. By transfecting small
interfering RNAs directed against 514 human proteases into polyQ
HTT-expressing HEK293 cells, Miller et al. (2010) identified 11
proteases, including MMP10 (185260), MMP14 (600754), and MMP23B
(603321), as putative polyQ HTT-processing proteases. Further
characterization revealed that MMP10 was the only metalloprotease in
this group that directly processed polyQ HTT; MMP14 and MMP23B appeared
to cause polyQ HTT degradation indirectly. MMP10 cleaved polyQ HTT at a
conserved site near the N terminus with the consensus sequence
(S/T)xxGG(I/L). Both Mmp10 and Mmp14 were upregulated in mouse striatal
cells expressing polyQ HTT, and knockdown of either Mmp10 or Mmp14
reduced cell death and caspase activation. Htt and Mmp10 colocalized in
cells undergoing apoptosis.

Godin et al. (2010) noted that HTT expression is associated with the
centrosomal region and microtubules of dividing cells. They found that
HTT localized to the spindle poles during mitosis from prophase to
anaphase in both HeLa cells and dividing mouse cortical neurons.
Knockdown of HTT expression in either cell model resulted in a spindle
orientation defect. The defect could be reversed in mouse cortical
neurons by expression of a 1,301-amino acid N-terminal fragment of mouse
Htt or a 620-amino acid N-terminal fragment of Drosophila Htt. Depletion
of Htt in mouse cells caused partial mislocalization of p150(Glued),
dispersal of dynein and Numa (NUMA1; 164009), and asynchronous cell
division. In day-14.5 mouse embryos, asynchronous division due to Htt
depletion led to premature neuronal differentiation at the expense of
proliferation and maintenance of progenitors in the neocortex. Godin et
al. (2010) concluded that HTT functions as a scaffold protein for the
dynein/dynactin complex in dividing cells.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

The Huntington's Disease Collaborative Research Group (1993) identified
an expanded (CAG)n repeat on 1 allele of the HTT gene (613004.0001) in
affected members from all of 75 HD families examined. The families came
from a variety of ethnic backgrounds and demonstrated a variety of
4p16.3 haplotypes. The findings indicated that the HD mutation involves
an unstable DNA segment similar to those previously observed in several
disorders, including the fragile X syndrome (300624), Kennedy syndrome
(313200), and myotonic dystrophy. The fact that the phenotype of HD is
completely dominant suggested that the disorder results from a
gain-of-function mutation in which either the mRNA product or the
protein product of the disease allele has some new property or is
expressed inappropriately (Myers et al., 1989).

Duyao et al. (1993), Snell et al. (1993), and Andrew et al. (1993)
analyzed the number of CAG repeats in a total of about 1,200 HTT genes
and in over 2,000 normal controls. Read (1993) summarized and collated
the results. In all 3 studies, the normal range of repeat numbers was
9-11 at the low and 34-37 at the high end, with a mean ranging from
18.29 to 19.71. Duyao et al. (1993) found a range of 37-86 in HD
patients, with a mean of 46.42.

Rubinsztein et al. (1996) studied a large cohort of individuals who
carried between 30 and 40 CAG repeats in the HTT gene. They used a PCR
method that allowed the examination of CAG repeats only, thereby
excluding the CCG repeats, which represent a polymorphism, as a
confounding factor. No individual with 35 or fewer CAG repeats had
clinical manifestations of HD. Most individuals with 36 to 39 CAG
repeats were clinically affected, but 10 persons (aged 67-95 years) had
no apparent symptoms of HD. The authors concluded that the HD mutation
is not fully penetrant in individuals with a borderline number of CAG
repeats.

Gusella et al. (1996) gave a comprehensive review of the molecular
genetic aspects of Huntington disease.

- Mechanism of Repeat Expansion

Zuhlke et al. (1993) studied the length variation of the repeat in 513
non-HD chromosomes from normal individuals and HD patients; the group
comprised 23 alleles with 11 to 33 repeats. In an analysis of the
inheritance of the (CAG)n stretch, they found meiotic instability for HD
alleles, (CAG)40 to (CAG)75, with a mutation frequency of approximately
70%; following the HD allele in 38 pedigrees during 54 meioses, they
found a ratio of stable to altered copy number of 15:39. On the other
hand, in 431 meioses of normal alleles, only 2 expansions were
identified. They found that the risk of expansion during spermatogenesis
was enhanced compared to oogenesis, explaining juvenile onset by
transmission from affected fathers. No mosaicism or differences in
repeat lengths were observed in the DNA from different tissues,
including brain and lymphocytes of 2 HD patients, indicating mitotic
stability of the mutation. Thus, the determination of the repeat number
in the DNA of blood lymphocytes is probably representative of all
tissues in a patient.

Telenius et al. (1994) found somatic mosaicism for the CAG repeat in
different tissues from 12 HD patients. Mosaicism for the highest numbers
of CAG repeats was found in the brain, particularly in the basal ganglia
and cortex, with lesser changes in the cerebellum. Sperm samples from 4
males also showed high levels of somatic mosaicism. Blood and other
tissues showed lower levels of mosaicism. Telenius et al. (1994)
suggested that expanded HTT gene CAG repeats are associated with
tissue-specific mitotic and meiotic instability.

MacDonald et al. (1993) found that unlike the similar CCG repeat in the
fragile X syndrome, the expanded HD repeat shows no evidence of somatic
instability in a comparison of blood, lymphoblast, and brain DNA from
the same persons. Furthermore, 4 pairs of monozygotic HD twins displayed
identical CAG repeat lengths, suggesting that repeat size is determined
in gametogenesis. However, in contrast to the fragile X syndrome and
with HD somatic tissue, mosaicism was readily detected as a diffuse
spread of repeat lengths in DNA from HD sperm samples. Thus, the
developmental timing of repeat instability appears to differ between HD
and fragile X syndrome, indicating perhaps that the fundamental
mechanisms leading to repeat expansion are distinct.

Leeflang et al. (1995) amplified the CAG triplet repeat region of the HD
gene in 923 single sperm from 3 affected and 2 normal individuals.
Average-sized alleles (15-18 repeats) showed only 3 contraction
mutations among 475 sperm (0.6%). A 30-repeat normal allele showed an
11% mutation frequency. The mutation frequency of a 36-repeat
intermediate allele was 53% with 8% of all gametes having expansions
that brought the allele size into the HD disease range (38 repeats or
more). Disease alleles (38-51 repeats) showed a very high mutation
frequency (92-99%). As repeat number increased, the authors found a
marked elevation in the frequency of expansions, in the mean number of
repeats added per expansion, and in the size of the largest observed
expansion. Contraction frequencies also appeared to increase with allele
size but decreased as repeat number exceeded 36. Since the sperm typing
data were of a discrete nature rather than consisting of smears of PCR
products from pooled sperm, Leeflang et al. (1995) could compare the
observed mutation frequency spectra to the distribution calculated using
discrete stochastic models based on current molecular ideas of the
expansion process. An excellent fit was found when the model specified
that a random number of repeats are added during the progression of the
DNA polymerase through the repeated region.

All mutations for Huntington disease arise from so-called intermediate
alleles (IAs) containing between 29 and 35 CAG repeats. The CAG repeats
expand on transmission through the paternal germline to 36 or more
repeats. Intermediate alleles are present on approximately 1% of normal
chromosomes of Caucasian descent. Affected individuals have an expanded
allele of between 36 to 121 CAGs, but incomplete penetrance has been
found for repeat lengths of 36 to 40 CAGs. Using single sperm analysis,
Chong et al. (1997) assessed CAG mutation frequencies of 4 IAs in
families with sporadic HD and IAs ascertained from the general
population by analyzing 1161 single sperm from 3 persons. They showed
that the intermediate alleles of the former group were more unstable
than those in the general population with identical size and sequence.
Furthermore, comparison of different sized IAs and IAs with different
sequences between the CAG and the adjacent CCG tracts indicated that DNA
sequence is a major influence on CAG stability. These studies provided
estimates of the likelihood of expansion to 36 or more CAG repeats for
individuals in the 2 groups. For an IA with (CAG)35 in the family with
sporadic HD, the likelihood for sibs to inherit a recurrent mutation
equal to or more than (CAG)36 was approximately 10%. For intermediate
alleles of a similar size in the general population, the risk of
inheriting an expanded allele of 36 or more CAGs through the paternal
germline was approximately 6%.

By typing greater than 3,500 sperm, Leeflang et al. (1999) determined
the size distribution of HD germline mutations produced by 26 men in the
Venezuelan cohort with CAG/CTG repeat numbers ranging from 37 to 62.
Both the mutation frequency and mean change in allele size increased
with increasing somatic repeat number. The mutation frequencies averaged
82%, and for individuals with at least 50 repeats, 98%. The
extraordinarily high mutation frequency levels are most consistent with
a process that occurs throughout germline mitotic divisions, rather than
resulting from a single meiotic event. A statistical model based on
incomplete processing of Okazaki fragments during DNA replication was
found to provide an excellent fit to the data, but variation in
parameter values among individuals suggests that the molecular mechanism
might be more complex.

Large intergenerational repeat expansions of the CAG trinucleotide
repeat in the HD gene are well documented for the male germline. Laccone
and Christian (2000) described a recurrent large expansion of a maternal
allele with 36 CAG repeats (to 66 and 57 repeats, respectively, in 2
daughters) associated with onset of Huntington disease in the second and
third decade in a family without history of HD. The findings gave
evidence of gonadal mosaicism in the unaffected mother. Laccone and
Christian (2000) hypothesized that large expansions also occur in the
female germline and that a negative selection of oocytes with long
repeats may explain the different instability behavior of the male and
female germlines.

Kovtun et al. (2000) followed the fate of the CAG trinucleotide repeat,
during transmission, in a transgene containing the exon 1 portion of the
human Huntington disease gene. Similar to humans, the mouse transmits
expansions predominantly through the male germline. However, the CAG
repeat size of the mutant human HD gene is different in male and female
progeny from identical fathers. Males predominantly expanded the repeat,
whereas females predominantly contracted the repeat. In contrast to the
classic definition of imprinting, CAG expansion is influenced by the
gender of the embryo. The authors hypothesized that there may be X- or
Y-encoded factors that influence repair or replication of DNA in the
embryo, and that gender dependence in the embryo may explain why
expansion in HD from premutation to disease primarily occurs through the
paternal line.

Yoon et al. (2003) performed single-molecule DNA analysis of testicular
germ cells isolated by laser capture microdissection from 2 HD patients,
showing that trinucleotide repeat expansion mutations were present
before the end of the first present meiotic division, and some mutations
were present even before meiosis began. Most of the larger Huntington
disease mutations were found in the postmeiotic cell population,
suggesting that expansions may continue to occur during meiosis and/or
after meiosis is complete.

Kennedy et al. (2003) showed dramatic mutation length increases (gains
of 16 to 1,000 CAG repeats) in human striatal cells early in the disease
course, most likely before the onset of pathologic cell loss. Studies of
knockin HD mice indicated that the size of the initial CAG repeat
mutation may influence both onset and tissue-specific patterns of
age-dependent, expansion-biased mutation length variability. Given that
CAG repeat length strongly correlates with clinical severity, Kennedy et
al. (2003) suggested that somatic increases of mutation length may play
a major role in the progressive nature and cell-selective aspects of
both adult-onset and juvenile-onset HD pathogenesis.

Cannella et al. (2005) reported a triplet size increase in an
intermediate-sized allele (34 CAG) of the huntingtin gene carried by a
lymphoblast cell culture after 30 passages. This finding demonstrated
that the huntingtin gene shows somatic as well as germline instability
and has a propensity for somatic CAG variation in human cells even with
repeat numbers under the expanded edge (i.e., intermediate alleles being
defined as containing between 29 and 35 CAG repeats). Factors
potentially cis acting with this particular mutation included a CCG
polymorphic stretch, deletion of the glutamic acid residue at position
2642, and the 4-codon segment between CAG and CCG polymorphisms.

Kovtun et al. (2007) demonstrated that the age-dependent somatic CAG
expansion associated with Huntington disease (Kennedy et al., 2003)
occurs in the process of removing oxidized base lesions, and is
remarkably dependent on the single-base excision repair enzyme
7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine-DNA glycosylase (OGG1; 601982). Both in vivo
and in vitro results supported a 'toxic oxidation' model in which OGG1
initiates an escalating oxidation-excision cycle that leads to
progressive age-dependent expansion. Kovtun et al. (2007) concluded that
age-dependent CAG expansion provides a direct molecular link between
oxidative damage and toxicity in postmitotic neurons through a DNA
damage response, and error-prone repair of single-strand breaks.

ANIMAL MODEL

Nasir et al. (1995) created a targeted disruption in exon 5 of Hdh, the
murine homolog of the HTT gene, using homologous recombination. They
found that homozygotes died before embryonic day 8.5 and initiated
gastrulation, but did not proceed to the formation of somites or to
organogenesis. Mice heterozygous for the mutation displayed increased
motor activity and cognitive deficits. Neuropathologic assessment of 2
heterozygous mice showed a significant neuronal loss in the subthalamic
nucleus. These studies showed that the HD gene is essential for
postimplantation development and that it may play an important role in
normal functioning of the basal ganglia.

To distinguish between 'loss-of-function' and 'gain-of-function' models
of HD, Duyao et al. (1995) inactivated the mouse Hdh by gene targeting.
Mice heterozygous for Hdh inactivation were phenotypically normal,
whereas homozygosity resulted in embryonic death. Homozygotes displayed
abnormal gastrulation at embryonic day 7.5 and were resorbing by day
8.5. The authors concluded that huntingtin is critical early in
embryonic development, before the emergence of the nervous system. That
Hdh inactivation did not mimic adult HD neuropathology suggested to the
authors that the human disease involves a gain of function.

Zeitlin et al. (1995) also used targeted gene disruption of Hdh and
found that mice nullizygous for the Hdh gene showed developmental
retardation and disorganization as embryos and died between days 8.5 and
10.5 of gestation. Based on the observation that the level of the
regionalized apoptotic cell death in the embryonic ectoderm, a layer
expressing the Hdh gene, was much higher than normal in the null
mutants, Zeitlin et al. (1995) proposed that huntingtin is involved in
processes counterbalancing the operation of an apoptotic pathway.

Hodgson et al. (1996) reported results of their studies designed to
rescue the embryonic lethality phenotype that results from targeted
disruption of the murine HD gene. They generated viable offspring that
were homozygous for the disrupted murine HD gene and that expressed
human huntingtin derived from a YAC transgene. These results indicated
that the YAC transgene was expressed prior to 7.5 days' gestation and
that the human huntingtin protein was functional in a murine background.

MacDonald et al. (1996) reviewed the work with targeted inactivation of
the mouse Hdh gene.

It is known that huntingtin plays a fundamental role in development,
since gene targeted Hd -/- mouse embryos died shortly after
gastrulation. Metzler et al. (2000) analyzed expression of huntingtin in
a variety of hematopoietic cell types, and in vitro hematopoiesis was
assessed using an Hd +/- and several Hd -/- embryonic stem (ES) cell
lines. Although wildtype and the 2 mutant cell lines formed primary
embryoid bodies (EBs) with similar efficiency, the number of
hematopoietic progenitors detected at various stages of the in vitro
differentiation were reduced in both of the heterozygous and the
homozygous ES cell lines examined. Expression analyses of hematopoietic
markers within the EBs revealed that primitive and definitive
hematopoiesis occurs in the absence of huntingtin. However, further
analysis using a suspension culture in the presence of hematopoietic
cytokines demonstrated a highly significant gene dosage-dependent
decrease in proliferation and/or survival of Hd +/- and Hd -/- cells.
Enrichment for the CD34+ (142230) cells within the EB confirmed that the
impairment is intrinsic to the hematopoietic cells. These observations
suggested that huntingtin expression is required for the generation and
expansion of hematopoietic cells and provides an alternative system in
which to assess the function of huntingtin.

Clabough and Zeitlin (2006) found that mice with targeted deletion of
the short CAG triplet repeat (7Q) in the Htt gene showed no gross
phenotypic differences compared to control littermates. However, adult
mice showed mild learning and memory deficits and slightly better motor
coordination compared to wildtype mice. Fibroblast cultures derived from
the 7Q-deletion mice had increased levels of ATP and senesced earlier
compared to wildtype fibroblasts. The findings indicated that the polyQ
stretch is not required for an essential function of HTT, but may be
required for modulating longevity in culture or modulating a function
involved in regulating energy homeostasis.

To determine whether caspase cleavage of HTT is a key event in the
neuronal dysfunction and selective neurodegeneration in HD, Graham et
al. (2006) generated YAC mice expressing caspase-3 (CASP3; 600636)- and
caspase-6 (CASP6; 601532)-resistant mutant human HTT. Mice expressing
mutant HTT resistant to cleavage by caspase-6, but not by caspase-3,
maintained normal neuronal function and did not develop
neurodegeneration. Furthermore, caspase-6-resistant mutant HTT mice were
protected against neurotoxicity induced by multiple stressors, including
NMDA, quinolinic acid, and staurosporine. Graham et al. (2006) concluded
that proteolysis of HTT at the caspase-6 cleavage site is a crucial and
rate-limiting step in the pathogenesis of HD.

Dietrich et al. (2009) inactivated the mouse Hdh gene in Wnt1 (164820)
cell lineages, which contribute to development of the midbrain,
hindbrain, granular cells of the cerebellum, and dorsal midline-derived
ependymal secretory structures, using the Cre-loxP system of
recombination. Conditional inactivation of the Hdh gene in Wnt1 cell
lineages resulted in congenital hydrocephalus, which was associated with
increase in CSF production by the choroid plexus, and abnormal
subcommissural organ.

Using synthetic antisense morpholinos to inhibit the translation of
huntingtin mRNA during early zebrafish development, Henshall et al.
(2009) determined the effects of huntingtin loss of function on the
developing nervous system, observing distinct defects in morphology of
neuromasts, olfactory placode, and branchial arches. There was impaired
formation of the anterior-most region of the neural plate as indicated
by reduced pre-placodal and telencephalic gene expression, with no
effect on mid- or hindbrain formation. The authors suggested a specific
'rate-limiting' role for huntingtin in formation of the telencephalon
and the pre-placodal region, and differing levels of requirement for
huntingtin function in specific nerve cell types.

Yamanaka et al. (2010) performed a comprehensive analysis of altered DNA
binding of multiple transcription factors using brains from R6/2 HD
mice, which express an N-terminal fragment of mutant huntingtin (Nhtt).
The authors observed a reduction of DNA binding of Brn2 (600494), a POU
domain transcription factor involved in differentiation and function of
hypothalamic neurosecretory neurons. Brn2 lost its function through 2
pathways, sequestration by mutant Nhtt and reduced transcription,
leading to reduced expression of hypothalamic neuropeptides. In
contrast, Brn1 (602480) was not sequestered by mutant Nhtt but was
upregulated in R6/2 brain, except in hypothalamus. Yamanaka et al.
(2010) concluded that functional suppression of Brn2 together with a
region-specific lack of compensation by Brn1 may mediate hypothalamic
cell dysfunction by mutant Nhtt.

Jiang et al. (2012) found that mutant Htt interacted with Sirt1 (604479)
and interfered with Sirt1 deacetylase activity in a mouse model of HD.
Overexpression of Sirt1 reversed neurodegeneration and molecular changes
observed in HD mice. Independently, Jeong et al. (2012) presented
similar findings, including interaction of Htt with Sirt1. They found
that interaction between Torc1 (CRTC1; 607536) and Creb (123810) had a
crucial role in Sirt1-mediated reversal of mutant Htt effects.

MODEL section in 143100.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HUNTINGTON DISEASE
HTT, (CAG)n EXPANSION

Huntington disease (HD; 143100) is caused by expansion of a polymorphic
trinucleotide repeat (CAG)n, encoding glutamine, located in the
N-terminal coding region of the HTT gene. In normal individuals, the
range of repeat numbers is 9 to 36. In those with HD, the repeat number
is above 37 (Duyao et al., 1993).

The trinucleotide repeat expansion was identified in affected members of
75 families with HD by the Huntington's Disease Collaborative Research
Group (1993). The families came from a variety of ethnic backgrounds and
demonstrated a variety of 4p16.3 haplotypes.

Gellera et al. (1996) noted that the unstable (CAG)n repeat lies
immediately upstream from a moderately polymorphic polyproline-encoding
(CCG)n repeat. They noted further that a number of reports in the
literature indicated that in normal subjects the number of (CAG)n
repeats ranges from 9 to 36, while in HD patients it ranges from 37 to
100. The downstream (CCG)n repeat may vary in size between 7 and 12
repeats in both affected and normal individuals. They reported the
occurrence of a CAA trinucleotide deletion (nucleotides 433-435) in HD
chromosomes in 2 families that, because of its position within the
conventional antisense primer hd447, hampered HD mutation detection if
only the (CAG)n tract were amplified. Therefore, Gellera et al. (1996)
stressed the importance of using a series of 3 diagnostic PCR reactions:
one that amplified the (CAG)n tract alone, one that amplified the (CCG)n
tract alone, and one that amplified the whole region.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Aminopeptidases play a role in the metabolism of several peptides that
may be involved in blood pressure and the pathogenesis of essential
hypertension (145500). Adipocyte-derived leucine aminopeptidase (ALAP)
is a member of the M1 family of zinc metallopeptidases.

CLONING

By searching for cDNAs with the potential to encode large proteins
expressed in brain, Nagase et al. (1998) identified a partial cDNA
encoding ERAP1, which they called KIAA0525. The 875-amino acid protein
was predicted to be 44% identical to ALPP (171800) over 428 amino acids.
RT-PCR analysis detected highest expression in placenta, ovary, kidney,
and thymus.

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to ALPP, Hattori et
al. (1999) obtained a full-length cDNA encoding ALAP. The deduced
941-amino acid protein contains an N-terminal signal peptide, 5
potential N-glycosylation sites, a potential membrane-spanning domain,
and a zinc-binding motif. Northern blot analysis revealed expression of
3.6- and 5.1-kb transcripts in all tissues tested except brain, where
only the 5.1-kb mRNA was expressed. An additional 5.6-kb transcript was
expressed in spleen and ovary. Hattori et al. (1999) identified an ALAP
splice variant encoding a protein with 948 residues. Western blot
analysis showed expression of an approximately 100-kD cytoplasmic
protein, close to the predicted size. Functional analysis indicated a
preference for leucine substrates.

By expressing recombinant ALAP in Chinese hamster ovary cells, Hattori
et al. (2000) showed that ALAP is a monomeric protein with a molecular
mass of 120 kD that hydrolyzes a variety of bioactive peptides,
including angiotensin II (see 106150). ALAP was expressed widely in
human tissues, including the cortex of the kidney, where tissue
kallikrein (147910) is localized. The authors suggested that ALAP plays
a role in the regulation of blood pressure through inactivation of
angiotensin II and/or generation of bradykinin (see 113503) in the
kidney.

Schomburg et al. (2000) cloned rat Alap, which they termed
puromycin-insensitive, leucyl-specific aminopeptidase, or Pilsap. Pilsap
is a 930-amino acid protein, and its hydrolytic activity appeared to be
restricted to leucine and, to a lesser extent, methionine.

Serwold et al. (2002) biochemically purified and cloned the 930-amino
acid mouse aminopeptidase, which they termed Eraap. Western blot and
immunofluorescence microscopy showed that the approximately 106-kD
glycosylated protein, which is upregulatable by gamma-interferon (IFNG;
147570), trims N-terminal lysine, leucine, tyrosine, and asparagine
residues when they are not followed by proline in the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) to yield the optimal octamer, primarily, and nonamer
peptides for antigen presentation by major histocompatibility complex
(MHC) molecules. Serwold et al. (2002) concluded that cytoplasmic
proteolysis generates only the C terminus of antigenic peptides. After
transport by TAP (170260), N-terminally extended peptides bind to MHC in
the ER and are then trimmed by Eraap to acquire the optimal length
before export from the ER, explaining why peptides presented by MHC
class I have precise lengths.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Hattori et al. (2001) determined that the
ERAP1 gene contains 20 exons and spans approximately 47 kb. Primer
extension analysis revealed 2 transcriptional initiation sites but no
TATA or CAAT boxes. Luciferase reporter assays revealed a functional
promoter activity in the 5-prime-flanking region of the gene and
suggested that the activity is regulated in a cell type-specific manner.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the ERAP1 gene
to chromosome 5. By genomic sequence analysis, Hattori et al. (2001)
mapped the ERAP1 gene to chromosome 5q15 close to the leucyl-cystinyl
aminopeptidase gene (LNPEP; 151300), suggesting a recent gene
duplication.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis and by coimmunoprecipitation experiments, Cui
et al. (2002) found that human ARTS1 bound to the extracellular domain
of TNFR1 (191190). Overexpression of ARTS1 resulted in increased TNFR1
shedding and decreased membrane-associated TNFR1. Reducing the membrane
levels of ARTS1 by expression of antisense ARTS1 mRNA had the opposite
effect. Recombinant ARTS1 demonstrated selective aminopeptidase activity
toward nonpolar amino acids, but it had no activity against TNFR1 and
was not the TNFR1 sheddase. ARTS1 neither bound to TNFR2 (191191) nor
altered its shedding, suggesting specificity for TNFR1. Cui et al.
(2002) concluded that formation of the TNFR1-ARTS1 molecular complex
represents a novel mechanism by which TNFR1 shedding is regulated.

Saric et al. (2002) and York et al. (2002) determined that purified
ERAP1 trims peptides greater than 10 residues in length, but it spares
and enhances the production of 8-residue peptides generated either in
the ER or cytosol. ERAP1 was also found to trim nearly half of 9-residue
peptides, thereby reducing the supply of antigenic peptides in the
absence of IFNG expression, which induces ERAP1 expression and instead
causes proteasomes to produce more N-terminally extended antigenic
precursors and 9-residue peptides.

Using fractionated ER contents to test for aminopeptidase activity,
Saveanu et al. (2005) found that ERAP1 and ERAP2 (609497) copurified.
Confocal microscopy confirmed colocalization of ERAP1 and ERAP2 in the
ER. Immunoprecipitation experiments suggested that ERAP1 and ERAP2 form
heterodimers. Enzymatic analysis showed that ERAP2 preferentially
hydrolyzed the basic residues arg and lys, whereas ERAP1 acted on leu.
Trimming did not continue after production of minimal nonamer epitopes.
Saveanu et al. (2005) concluded that ERAP1 and ERAP2 function in a
complementary manner on peptides with 9 or more residues.

Using synthetic peptides and natural antigenic precursors, Chang et al.
(2005) showed that ERAP1 preferred substrates of the same lengths (9 to
16 residues) as those transported by TAP. Like most MHC class I
molecules, ERAP1 preferred peptides with hydrophobic C-terminal amino
acids. Chang et al. (2005) concluded that these properties, particularly
its 'molecular ruler' mechanism of binding hydrophobic C termini 9 to 16
residues from the active site, distinguish ERAP1 from other
aminopeptidases. They proposed that ERAP1 evolved to facilitate antigen
presentation.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Hypothesizing that genomic variants of the ALAP gene may be associated
with hypertension or individual variations in blood pressure, Yamamoto
et al. (2002) screened the ALAP gene for mutations in 488 unrelated
Japanese individuals. They identified 33 polymorphisms, including 15
novel polymorphisms. One, lys528 to arg, showed an association with
essential hypertension. The estimated odds ratio for essential
hypertension was 2.3 for presence of the arg allele at codon 528, in
comparison with presence of the lys/lys genotype (P of 0.004). The lys
at codon 528 is conserved in ALAP, LNPEP, rat Pils, and mouse VEGF
(192240)-induced aminopeptidase.

For discussion of a possible association between variation in the ERAP1
gene and ankylosing spondylitis, see SPDA1 (106300).

ANIMAL MODEL

York et al. (2006) generated fertile, healthy mice lacking Erap1. MHC
class I levels were reduced in Erap1 -/- splenocytes, but not
fibroblasts, and peptide trimming in Erap1 -/- fibroblasts was reduced.
The immune response in Erap1 -/- mice to some viral peptides was altered
due to lack of the trimming enzyme.

607901	TITLE *607901 FERMITIN FAMILY (DROSOPHILA) HOMOLOG 3; FERMT3
;;UNC112-RELATED PROTEIN 2; URP2;;
KINDLIN 3; KIND3;;
MIG2B
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The FERMT3 gene encodes a protein involved in integrin activation; it is
specifically expressed in hematopoietic cells (Moser et al., 2008). See
also FERMT1 (607900), which is specific to epithelial cells, and FERMT2
(607746), which has more widespread expression.

CLONING

Using microarray analysis of genes showing altered expression in several
tumor tissues, followed by PCR of brain cDNA, Weinstein et al. (2003)
cloned a full-length URP2 cDNA, encoding a protein with significant
homology to the C. elegans protein Unc112. The deduced 663-amino acid
protein has a calculated molecular mass of about 75.4 kD. They also
cloned a variant that contains a 12-bp insertion from a leukocyte cDNA
library. This variant encodes a 667-amino acid protein with a calculated
molecular mass of almost 76 kD. In its C-terminal half, URP2 contains 2
FERM domains flanking a pleckstrin homology domain. URP2 shares 55.4%
identity with MIG2 (607746) and 58.7% identity with URP1 (607900). All 3
proteins share weak but significant homology with talin-1 (186745) and
talin-2 (607349). Northern blot analysis detected strong expression of a
2.7-kb URP2 transcript in thymus, spleen, and leukocytes, weaker
expression in lung and placenta, and little to no expression in other
tissues.

By analyzing membrane proteins expressed in chronic lymphocytic
leukemia, followed by database analysis, Boyd et al. (2003) identified
MIG2B cDNAs. Quantitative RT-PCR showed hemopoietic tissue-specific
MIG2B expression and increased MIG2B expression in B-cell malignancies.
By SDS-PAGE, the apparent molecular mass of MIG2B was 60 kD.

GENE STRUCTURE

Weinstein et al. (2003) determined that the URP2 gene contains 15 exons,
spans about 20 kb, and is oriented in the telomere-to-centromere
direction. The URP2 splice variant utilizes an alternative exon 10
acceptor site.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Weinstein et al. (2003) mapped the URP2
gene to chromosome 11q12.

GENE FUNCTION

Using immunoblot analysis, Manevich-Mendelson et al. (2009) showed that
KIND3-negative patients with leukocyte adhesion deficiency-3 (LAD3;
612840) who also lacked expression of CDGI (RAPGEF1; 600303) in resting
T cells (see MOLECULAR GENETICS) acquired CDGI expression after T-cell
activation. Inside-out (i.e., chemokine-mediated) activation with CXCL12
(600835) of normal and KIND3-negative cells resulted in normal CXCR4
(162643) expression but defective conformational activation of LFA1 (see
ITGB2; 600065) and diminished transient and firm adhesiveness during a
range of contact periods. In contrast, the intrinsic adhesiveness of
VLA4 (see ITGA4; 192975) was largely conserved in KIND3-negative cells.
Manevich-Mendelson et al. (2009) concluded that KIND3 is more critical
to LFA1 than to VLA4 adhesiveness in human lymphocytes.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Integrins, the major adhesion receptors of leukocytes and platelets,
bind poorly to their ligands but become active after 'inside-out'
signaling through other membrane receptors. Hematopoietically derived
cells from individuals with leukocyte adhesion deficiency-3 (LAD3;
612840) express beta-1 (ITGB1; 135630), beta-2 (ITGB2; 600065), and
beta-3 (ITGB3; 173470) integrins, but defective inside-out signaling
results in LAD1 (116920)-like immune deficiency and Glanzmann
thrombasthenia (GT; 273800)-like bleeding problems. Svensson et al.
(2009) noted that Pasvolsky et al. (2007) reported a C-to-A change at a
putative splice acceptor site for exon 16 of the RASGRP2 gene (605577)
as the cause of LAD3 in 2 Turkish patients. Svensson et al. (2009)
identified this RASGRP2 change in 2 additional Turkish LAD3 patients,
but a third Maltese LAD3 patient lacked any changes in the RASGRP2 gene.
Furthermore, Svensson et al. (2009) showed that the C-to-A change had
little or no effect on RASGRP2 mRNA and protein levels, and that RASGRP2
function could not be restored by expression of wildtype RASGRP2.
Instead, Svensson et al. (2009) identified mutations in the KINDLIN3
gene as the cause of LAD3 in the 2 Turkish patients and the Maltese
patient they reported. The Turkish patients were homozygous for an
arg509-to-ter (R509X; 607901.0001) nonsense mutation, and the Maltese
patient was homozygous for an A-to-G transition at the splice acceptor
site of exon 14 (607901.0002). RT-PCR analyses showed that both
mutations destabilized KINDLIN3 mRNA upstream of the mutations. Western
blot analysis showed no expression of KINDLIN3 protein in the patients,
whereas expression was normal in their parents. Interference reflection
microscopy revealed that wildtype KINDLIN3 corrected defective adhesion
to and migration on ICAM1 (147840) by patient B cells. Svensson et al.
(2009) concluded that mutations in KINDLIN3 cause LAD3, and that
wildtype KINDLIN3 can overcome LAD3 defects by generating integrin
adhesive contacts and integrin-mediated migration of LAD3 lymphocytes.

In 9 patients with LAD1V from 7 unrelated consanguineous families
originally from central Turkey, Kuijpers et al. (2009) identified 3
disease-associated variants in genes on chromosome 11q13: a splice site
mutation in RASGRP2, an intronic deletion in NRXN2 (600566), and the
R509X mutation in FERMT3. Two other patients, one from a consanguineous
family from southeastern Turkey and the other from a consanguineous
Arabic family, had novel nonsense mutations in FERMT3, but they lacked
variants in RASGRP2 and NRXN2. The novel FERMT3 mutations were arg573 to
ter (R573X; 607901.0004) in the Turkish patient and trp229 to ter
(W229X; 607901.0005) in the Arabic patient. FERMT3 protein expression
was undetectable in leukocytes and platelets of all patients tested, and
all patients had similar neutrophil and platelet defects. Kuijpers et
al. (2009) concluded that the silent RASGRP1 mutation and the NRXN2
intronic deletion are not disease causing, but are in linkage
disequilibrium with the nonsense mutation in exon 12 of the FERMT3 gene
in the 7 previously reported Turkish families with LAD1V. They noted
that variation in the clinical symptoms of the 11 LAD1V patients
suggests that there is no strict genotype-phenotype relationship in
LAD1V.

In an African American girl with severe LAD3, McDowall et al. (2010)
identified 2 different homozygous mutations in the FERMT3 gene: G308R
(607901.0007) and 1275delT (607901.0008). In vitro studies indicated
that the truncated protein could not restore either leukocyte adhesion
or migration, whereas the G308R-mutant protein affected only migration.
These findings indicated a second activity of FERMT3 essential for
migration, in addition to adhesion.

In a 33-month-old first son of consanguineous Gypsy parents with LAD3
syndrome, Robert et al. (2011) identified a homozygous splice-site
mutation in the FERMT3 gene (607901.0009). His parents were heterozygous
carriers. The patient and his unaffected mother were also heterozygous
for a mutation in the ITGA2B gene (607759.0008).

ANIMAL MODEL

Moser et al. (2008) found that Kind3 -/- mice died within a week of
birth with pronounced osteopetrosis and severe hemorrhages in the
gastrointestinal tract, skin, brain, and bladder that were already
apparent during development. Chimeric animals with Kind3 -/- livers also
suffered a pronounced hemostatic defect, suggesting platelet
dysfunction. Platelet counts were normal in Kind3 -/- chimeras, but the
platelets were unable to activate integrins. Activation of integrins
normally occurs after platelets contact a wounded vessel and is mediated
by binding of talin to beta-integrin (see ITGB3; 173470) cytoplasmic
tails. Moser et al. (2008) showed that Kind3 bound to regions of
beta-integrin tails distinct from those bound by talin and triggered
integrin activation. They concluded that KIND3 is an essential element
for platelet integrin activation in hemostasis and thrombosis.

Using immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence microscopy, and leukocyte
adhesion analysis with neutrophils from Kind3 -/- mice, Moser et al.
(2009) demonstrated that mouse Kind3 bound to Itgb2 and was essential
for neutrophil binding and spreading on Itgb2 ligands, such as Icam1
(147840) and C3b (120700). Kind3 -/- neutrophils lost firm adhesion and
arrest on endothelial cells in vitro and in vivo, whereas selectin (see
173610)-mediated rolling was unaffected. Moser et al. (2009) concluded
that KIND3 is essential for activation of ITGB1, ITGB2, and ITGB3 and
that loss of Kind3 function in mice results in a LAD3-like phenotype.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
LEUKOCYTE ADHESION DEFICIENCY, TYPE III
FERMT3, ARG509TER

In a 4-year old Turkish boy with LAD3 (612840) originally reported by
Kuijpers et al. (2007) and an unrelated Turkish female infant with LAD3,
Svensson et al. (2009) identified a homozygous C-to-T transition at
nucleotide 1525 in exon 12 of the FERMT3 gene, resulting in an
arg509to-ter (R509X) substitution in the FERM F2 subdomain of the
protein.

In 9 children from 7 consanguineous families from central Turkey with
LAD3 originally reported by Kuijpers et al. (2007), Kuijpers et al.
(2009) identified homozygosity for the R509X mutation in the FERMT3
gene. All parents were heterozygous for this mutation.

.0002
LEUKOCYTE ADHESION DEFICIENCY, TYPE III
FERMT3, IVS13AS, A-G, -2

In a Maltese patient with LAD3 (612840) originally reported by McDowall
et al. (2003), Svensson et al. (2009) identified a homozygous A-to-G
transition at the splice acceptor site of exon 14 of the FERMT3 gene.
McDowall et al. (2003) reported that a sister of the patient died with
widespread bleeding hours after birth. The index patient was
successfully treated with a bone marrow transplant.

.0003
LEUKOCYTE ADHESION DEFICIENCY, TYPE III
FERMT3, TRP16TER

In 2 sibs, a boy and a girl, from the United Arab Emirates with symptoms
consistent with a severe form of LAD3 (612840), Malinin et al. (2009)
identified a homozygous G-to-A transition in exon 2 of the FERMT3 gene,
resulting in a trp16-to-ter (W16X) substitution. Both sibs presented
with severe bleeding and recurrent infections from 2 weeks of age,
followed by development of osteopetrosis at about 5 months of age.
Western blot analysis revealed a 56-kD FERMT3 fragment in patient cells,
but no full-length FERMT3. The authors suggested that the FERMT3
fragment in patient cells may have resulted from an alternative
downstream transcription initiation site at codon 181.

.0004
LEUKOCYTE ADHESION DEFICIENCY, TYPE III
FERMT3, ARG573TER

In a 2 year old with LAD3 (612840) and consanguineous parents from
southeastern Turkey, Kuijpers et al. (2009) identified a homozygous
C-to-T transition at nucleotide 1717 in exon 14 of the FERMT3 gene,
resulting in an arg573-to-ter (R573X) substitution in the 2nd FERM
domain of the protein. Both parents were heterozygous for this mutation.

.0005
LEUKOCYTE ADHESION DEFICIENCY, TYPE III
FERMT3, TRP229TER

In a child with LAD3 (612840) and consanguineous Arabic parents,
Kuijpers et al. (2009) identified a homozygous G-to-A transition at
nucleotide 687 in exon 6 of the FERMT3, resulting in a trp229-to-ter
(W229X) substitution. Both parents were heterozygous for this mutation.
The patient died after a hematopoietic stem-cell transplant.

.0006
LEUKOCYTE ADHESION DEFICIENCY, TYPE III
FERMT3, ARG513TER

In 3 Turkish patients with LAD3 (612840), Mory et al. (2008) identified
a homozygous C-to-T transition at nucleotide 1632 of the FERMT3 gene,
resulting in an arg513-to-ter (R513X) substitution. The patients'
parents were all heterozygous carriers of the R513X mutation, which was
not detected in 68 Turkish controls. These patients also had the
putative splice site mutation in RASGRP2 (605577) that Svensson et al.
(2009) and Kuijpers et al. (2009) excluded as a cause of LAD3.

.0007
LEUKOCYTE ADHESION DEFICIENCY, TYPE III
FERMT3, GLY308ARG

In an 11-month-old African American girl with LAD3 (612840), McDowall et
al. (2010) identified 2 homozygous mutations in the FERMT3 gene. One
mutation was a 922G-A transition in exon 8, resulting in a gly308-to-arg
(G308R) substitution in the loop linking the first half of FERM
subdomain 2 and the PH domain. The second homozygous mutation was a 1-bp
deletion (1275delT; 607901.0008). In vitro studies showed that patient T
cells failed to firmly adhere to ICAM1 (147840) and fibronectin (FN1;
135600) when adhesion was stimulated by inside-out signaling agonists.
This defect was rescued by transfection with wildtype FERMT3. Patient T
cells had significantly decreased levels of FERMT3 mRNA and no FERMT3
protein. In vitro functional expression assays showed that B cells
transfected with the G308R-mutant protein had correct FERMT3 membrane
localization and were able to adhere to ICAM1, but were unable to
migrate correctly compared to wildtype. These findings indicated a
second activity of FERMT3 essential for migration, in addition to
adhesion. The patient had a severe disorder, with severe bleeding
tendency, recurrent infections, and osteopetrosis. She was successfully
treated with bone marrow transplantation. The patient's unaffected
mother was heterozygous for both mutations, and showed about half-levels
of FERMT3 mRNA, consistent with the lack of a functional gene on 1
allele.

.0008
LEUKOCYTE ADHESION DEFICIENCY, TYPE III
FERMT3, 1-BP DEL, 1275T

In an 11-month-old African American girl with LAD3 (612840), McDowall et
al. (2010) identified 2 homozygous mutations in the FERMT3 gene. One
mutation was a 1-bp deletion (1275delT) in exon 11, resulting in
premature termination in the PH domain in the loop between the beta-6
and beta-7 strands. The second homozygous mutation was a G308R
substitution (607901.0007). In vitro functional expression assays showed
that B cells transfected with the 1275delT mutant protein had no FERMT3
membrane localization and were unable to adhere to ICAM1. The findings
indicated that the truncated PH domain was no longer capable of membrane
anchoring. The patient's unaffected mother was heterozygous for both
mutations, and showed about half-levels of FERMT3 mRNA, consistent with
the lack of a functional gene on 1 allele.

.0009
LEUKOCYTE ADHESION DEFICIENCY, TYPE III
FERMT3, IVS2AS, A-C, -2

In a 33-month-old first son of consanguineous Gypsy parents with LAD3
syndrome (612840), Robert et al. (2011) identified a homozygous
splice-site mutation in intron 2 of the FERMT3 gene. The mutation was an
A-to-C change that affected the acceptor splice site for exon 3
(310-2A-C using the cDNA sequence), resulting in the use of a cryptic
splice site 10 nucleotides after the normal start of exon 3, a
frameshift, and premature termination. The parents were heterozygous
carriers. The mutation resulted in absence of normal FERMT3 protein in
platelets and lymphocytes, failure of integrin activation, and impaired
platelet and leukocyte integrin-dependent function. The patient and his
unaffected mother were also heterozygous for a mutation in the ITGA2B
gene (607759.0008).
