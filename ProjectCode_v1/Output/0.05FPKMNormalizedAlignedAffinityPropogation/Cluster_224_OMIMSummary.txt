DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By proteomic analysis of human sperm 2D gels, followed by RACE-PCR of
human testicular cDNA, Mandal et al. (2003) cloned SPACA3, which they
called SLLP1, and identified the mouse and rat homologs. The deduced
215-amino acid SPACA3 protein has a calculated molecular mass of 23.4
kD. SPACA3 contains a putative transmembrane region followed by a
predicted protease cleavage site between an ala-lys linkage, a signature
sequence for the alpha-lactalbumin (149750)/lysozyme C (LYZ; 153450)
protein family, 3 predicted N-terminal and 1 C-terminal myristoylation
sites, and 2 phosphorylation sites. SPACA3 shares 53% and 52% identity
with monkey stomach lysozyme and human lysozyme, respectively. Northern
blot analysis of human tissues detected a 1.0-kb transcript in testis
only. Immunofluorescent studies localized SPACA3 to the sperm head
acrosome and equatorial segment, and immunogold staining detected SPACA3
distribution over the entire acrosomal matrix, including the principal
and equatorial segments.

GENE FUNCTION

Mandal et al. (2003) found no evidence for SPACA3 bacteriolytic
activity, and SPACA3 displayed no significant effect on human sperm
binding and fusion to zona-free hamster eggs.

GENE STRUCTURE

Mandal et al. (2003) determined that the SPACA3 gene contains 5 exons
spanning about 6.0 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Mandal et al. (2003) mapped the SPACA3
gene to chromosome 17q11.2. Zhang et al. (2005) mapped the SPACA3 gene
to 17q12.
