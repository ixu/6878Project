166945	TITLE *166945 NEIGHBOR OF BRCA1 GENE 1; NBR1
;;MEMBRANE COMPONENT, CHROMOSOME 17, SURFACE MARKER 2; M17S2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

In an attempt to clone the CA125 gene (606154), Campbell et al. (1994)
isolated a cDNA from an expression library that mapped close to the
BRCA1 locus (113705) at 17q21.1. Closer investigation showed that it was
within the smallest known region containing the BRCA1 gene. The
predicted 966-amino acid polypeptide lacks the membrane protein
characteristics expected for CA125 but does include a B-box/coiled-coil
motif present in many genes with transformation potential.

GENE FUNCTION

Lange et al. (2005) identified a signaling complex where the titin
(188840) protein kinase domain (TK) interacts with the zinc finger
protein NBR1 through a mechanically inducible conformation. NBR1 targets
the ubiquitin-associated p62/SQSTM1 (601530) to sarcomeres, and p62 in
turn interacts with MURF2 (606469), a muscle-specific RING-B-box E3
ligase and ligand of the transactivation domain of the serum response
transcription factor (SRF; 600589). Nuclear translocation of MURF2 was
induced by mechanical inactivity and caused reduction of nuclear SRF and
repression of transcription.

GENE STRUCTURE

Campbell et al. (1994) determined the exon structure of the M17S2 gene.

Brown et al. (1994), who referred to the gene as 1A1-3B, showed that the
transcription start site of M17S2 is 295 bp distal from the initiation
site of BRCA1 and that the gene is transcribed divergently from BRCA1.
The authors speculated that M17S2 may be involved in the regulation of
transcription or translation of BRCA1.

Brown et al. (1996) described the genomic region that encompasses both
the BRCA1 and M17S2 genes. They found a tandem duplication of 30 kb that
results in 2 copies of exons 1 and 2 of BRCA1 and exons 1 and 3 of
M17S2.

MAPPING

Campbell et al. (1994) used fluorescence in situ hybridization to
demonstrate mapping within the BRCA1 minimum region at 17q21.1. YAC and
cosmid clones were isolated and used to refine the location of the M17S2
gene adjacent and proximal to the RNU2 locus (180690).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Using extensive SSCP and sequence analysis, Campbell et al. (1994) did
not detect mutations in the coding region of the M17S2 gene in over 100
tumor and normal DNAs from familial and sporadic breast cancers and
sporadic ovarian cancers.

607096	TITLE *607096 SOLUTE CARRIER FAMILY 22 (URATE TRANSPORTER), MEMBER 12; SLC22A12
;;ORGANIC ANION TRANSPORTER 4-LIKE; OAT4L;;
URATE TRANSPORTER 1; URAT1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The SLC22A12 gene encodes URAT1, a renal urate-anion exchanger that
regulates blood urate levels.

CLONING

Enomoto et al. (2002) isolated a SLC22A12 cDNA from a human kidney cDNA
library. The cDNA, which they called URAT1 for 'urate transporter-1,'
corresponds to a gene of 2,642 basepairs encoding a protein of 555 amino
acids that is 42% identical to OAT4 (SLC22A11; 607097). The hydropathy
plot predicts 12 membrane-spanning domains in URAT1, which are similar
to those in members of the OAT family. URAT1 has 3 consensus sequences
for N-glycosylation and 2 cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase
phosphorylation sites. High stringency Northern analysis revealed
predominant expression of URAT1 mRNA in the human adult and fetal
kidney, and immunohistochemical analysis revealed that URAT1 protein is
prominent in epithelial cells of the proximal tubule of the renal
cortex. Under high magnification, the protein was found to be located in
the luminal membrane of the epithelium of proximal tubules but not in
that of distal tubules.

GENE FUNCTION

Enomoto et al. (2002) demonstrated that Xenopus oocytes injected with
URAT1 cRNA exhibited time-dependent transport activity of [14C]urate but
not of various typical substrates of OATs or organic cation
transporters. URAT1 was found to be a cotransporter with anions, in
particular chloride, bromide, or iodine, but not fluoride. Enomoto et
al. (2002) found that urate transport via URAT1 is inhibited selectively
by organic anions such as lactate, nicotinate, acetoacetate,
hydroxybutyrate, and succinate. Para-aminohippurate (PAH), the
representative substrate of OATs, did not exert an inhibitory effect on
urate uptake via URAT1, consistent with the observation that PAH has no
effect on the fractional excretion of urate in humans. Benzbromarone,
probenecid, phenylbutazone, sulfinpyrazone, nonsteroidal
antiinflammatory drugs, and diuretics inhibited urate uptake.
Trans-stimulation experiments indicated that the major counteranions
that exchange for urate via URAT1 are organic anions rather than
inorganic chloride.

Thangaraju et al. (2006) found the urinary excretion of urate was
significantly elevated in Cebpd (116898) -/- mice, although expression
of Urat1 was unaltered. However, expression of the Na(+)/lactate
cotransporters Slc5a8 (608044) and Slc5a12 (612455) was almost
completely ablated in Cebpd -/- mice. Thangaraju et al. (2006) proposed
that lactate reabsorption by SLC5A8 and SLC5A12 is coupled to urate
reabsorption by URAT1 at the proximal tubule apical membrane.

MAPPING

Enomoto et al. (2002) identified a sequence representing the SLC22A12
gene within a BAC clone (GenBank GENBANK AC044790) mapping to chromosome
11q13, near the SLC22A11 gene.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In patients with renal hypouricemia (220150), Enomoto et al. (2002) and
Tanaka et al. (2003) identified mutations in the SLC22A12 gene
(607096.0001-607096.0003).

Ichida et al. (2008) identified SLC22A12 mutations in 66 of 71 71
Japanese patients with hypouricemia. The W258X mutation (607096.0001)
was by far the most common mutation, occurring in 93 alleles, including
31 homozygotes and 23 compound heterozygotes. A total of 13 mutations,
including 3 novel mutations, were identified (see, e.g. 607096.0005;
607096.0006). Acute renal failure and urolithiasis occurred in 21.1% and
8.5% of patients, respectively. Three patients had chronic renal
failure. By haplotype analysis, Ichida et al. (2008) found that W258X
was a founder mutation with an estimated age of 6,820 years.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HYPOURICEMIA, RENAL, 1
SLC22A12, TRP258TER

In a 48-year-old male with idiopathic renal hypouricemia (220150),
Enomoto et al. (2002) identified a G-to-A transition at nucleotide 774
within exon 4 of the SLC22A12 gene, resulting in a tryptophan-to-stop
substitution at codon 258 (W258X). This mutation was found in
homozygosity and was not identified in 180 randomly chosen control
Japanese individuals.

In 2 brothers with hereditary renal hypouricemia and exercise-induced
acute renal failure, Tanaka et al. (2003) identified homozygosity for
the W258X mutation. The parents of the sibs and all of the sibs' 5
children were heterozygous for the mutation.

By haplotype analysis of 31 Japanese individuals homozygous for the
W258X mutation, Ichida et al. (2008) estimated that the mutation is
about 6,820 years old. This mutation dates back from between the time
when the Jomon people predominated in Japan and the time when the Yayoi
people started to migrate to Japan from the Korean peninsula.

.0002
HYPOURICEMIA, RENAL, 1
SLC22A12, THR217MET

In a patient with idiopathic renal hypouricemia (220150), Enomoto et al.
(2002) identified a C-to-T transition at nucleotide 650 in exon 3 of the
SLC22A12 gene, resulting in a threonine-to-methionine substitution at
codon 217 (T217M). This mutation was found in homozygosity and was not
identified in any of 180 randomly chosen control Japanese individuals.

.0003
HYPOURICEMIA, RENAL, 1
SLC22A12, GLU298ASP

In a patient with idiopathic renal hypouricemia (220150), Enomoto et al.
(2002) identified a G-to-T transversion at nucleotide 894 in exon 5 of
the SLC22A12 gene, resulting in a glutamic acid-to-aspartic acid
substitution at codon 298 (E298D). This mutation was found in
homozygosity and was not identified in any of 180 randomly chosen
control Japanese individuals.

.0004
HYPOURICEMIA, RENAL, 1
SLC22A12, LEU418ARG

In the affected member of a Japanese family with renal hypouricemia
(220150), Wakida et al. (2005) detected compound heterozygosity for
W258X (607096.0001) and for a novel mutation, a 1253T-G transversion in
the SLC22A12 gene that resulted in a leu418-to-arg (L418R) substitution
in the tenth transmembrane domain of the protein. The L418R mutation had
significantly reduced urate-transporting activities compared with
wildtype (P less than 0.05), suggesting that it is a loss-of-function
mutation.

.0005
HYPOURICEMIA, RENAL, 1
SLC22A12, ARG90HIS

In a Japanese man with renal hypouricemia (220150), Ichida et al. (2008)
identified a homozygous 269G-A transition in the SLC22A12 gene,
resulting in an arg90-to-his (R90H) substitution. Nine additional
affected individuals were compound heterozygous for R90H and W258X
(607096.0001).

.0006
HYPOURICEMIA, RENAL, 1
SLC22A12, GLY361VAL

In 2 unrelated Japanese individuals with renal hypouricemia (220150),
Ichida et al. (2008) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations
in the SLC22A12 gene: a 1082G-T transversion resulting in a
gly361-to-val (G361V) substitution, and W258X (607096.0001). In vitro
functional expression assays showed that the G361V-mutant protein had
decreased uric acid transport activity.

612509	TITLE *612509 ATP-BINDING CASSETTE, SUBFAMILY C, MEMBER 10; ABCC10
;;MULTIDRUG RESISTANCE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 7; MRP7
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the ABC family of membrane proteins, such as ABCC10, are
involved in energy-dependent transport of a wide variety of substrates
across membranes (Allikmets et al., 1996).

CLONING

Using the N-terminal ATP-binding domain of PGY1 (ABCB1; 171050) and the
complete sequence of CFTR (602421) to query a human EST database,
Allikmets et al. (1996) identified an ABCC10 clone, which they
designated EST182763, from an infant brain cDNA library. Northern blot
analysis detected a 5.5-kb transcript in lung, liver, and skeletal
muscle.

By database analysis, Hopper et al. (2001) obtained a full-length cDNA
encoding ABCC10, which they called MRP7. The 1,492-amino acid ABCC10
protein has a calculated molecular mass of 162 kD. It contains 2
nucleotide-binding folds, 17 predicted transmembrane segments arranged
in 3 transmembrane domains, and 3 predicted N-glycosylation sites.
Northern blot analysis was unable to detected ABCC10 expression, but
RT-PCR detected ABCC10 expression in all 10 tissues examined. In
vitro-translated ABCC10 had an apparent molecular mass of 158 kD by
SDS-PAGE.

GENE FUNCTION

Using deletion analysis, in situ mutagenesis, and electromobility shift
assays, Dabrowska and Sirotnak (2004) showed that basal MRP7 promoter
activity relied upon a proximal segment of the 5-prime flanking region
bearing an E2F site (see E2F1; 189971) acting cooperatively with 2
closely positioned SP1 (189906) sites. Two additional SP1 sites further
downstream were less important. The sequence of the E2F site was
noncanonical, but its interaction with E2F protein was confirmed.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid, radiation hybrid, and YAC analyses, Allikmets et
al. (1996) mapped the ABCC10 gene to chromosome 6p21. Using FISH, Hopper
et al. (2001) mapped the ABCC10 gene to chromosome 6p21-p12.

605958	TITLE *605958 TRAF-INTERACTING PROTEIN; TRAIP
;;TRIP;;
RING FINGER PROTEIN 206; RNF206
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 (TNFR1; 191190) and CD95/FAS (134637)
interact via their death domains with signal-transducing partners such
as FADD (602457), TRADD (603500), and members of the TNFR-associated
factor (TRAF) family (e.g., TRAF2; 601895). TRAFs in turn interact with
downstream signal transducers, such as TRIP, leading to apoptosis via
activation of nuclear factor kappa-B (NFKB; see 164011) (Lee et al.,
1997).

CLONING

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a mouse thymocyte cDNA library with
TRAF1 (601711) or TRAF2 as bait, followed by screening human and mouse
thymocyte cDNA libraries and a mouse T-cell cDNA library, Lee et al.
(1997) isolated full-length cDNAs encoding human and mouse TRIP
(TRAF-interacting protein). Sequence analysis predicted that the
469-amino acid human protein, which is 76% identical to the mouse
protein, has an N-terminal RING finger motif and a putative coiled-coil
domain. Northern blot analysis revealed highest expression of a 2.1-kb
transcript in mouse testis, thymus, and spleen. Expression of Trip was
reduced in activated lymphocytes.

GENE FUNCTION

Binding analysis by Lee et al. (1997) indicated that the N-terminal
coiled-coil region of TRIP interacts with the N-terminal TRAF domain of
TRAF1 or TRAF2 and with TNFR2 (191191) or CD30 (153243) when coexpressed
with TRAF. Overexpression of TRIP inhibited NFKB activation induced by
TNF (191160), but not NFKB activation induced by interleukin-1 (see
147760).

By yeast 2-hybrid screening with CYLD (605018) as bait, followed by Far
Western blot and coimmunoprecipitation analyses, Regamey et al. (2003)
found that the C terminus of TRIP interacted with the central domain of
CYLD. CYLD downregulated TNF-induced NFKB activation, and this
downregulation was dependent on CYLD-TRIP interaction and the
deubiquitinating activity of CYLD.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the TRIP
gene to chromosome 3 (TMAP WI-13434).

604866	TITLE *604866 PLEOMORPHIC ADENOMA GENE-LIKE 2; PLAGL2
DESCRIPTION PLAG1 (603026), a developmentally regulated C2H2 zinc finger gene at
chromosome 8q12, is the main target for pleomorphic adenomas of the
salivary gland. By screening a human fetal kidney cDNA library with EST
sequences showing homology to PLAG1, Kas et al. (1998) isolated a cDNA,
which they designated PLAGL2, encoding a 496-amino acid protein.
Sequence analysis of PLAGL2 showed at least 6 zinc fingers in the
N-terminal region and a proline- and serine-rich C terminus. The N
terminus of PLAGL2 is very similar to that of PLAGL1 (603044) and PLAG1
but the C-terminal regions are rather divergent. Northern blot analysis
revealed expression of 7.5-kb major and 2.5-kb minor PLAGL2 transcripts
in fetal kidney, liver, lung, and brain but not in adult tissues. The
authors determined that PLAGL2 and PLAG1 have only weak
transactivational capacity compared to the strong activity of PLAGL1.

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the PLAGL2
gene to chromosome 20 (TMAP KIAA0198).

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Zinc finger proteins have been shown to interact with nucleic acids and
to have diverse functions. The zinc finger domain is a conserved amino
acid sequence motif containing 2 specifically positioned cysteines and 2
histidines that are involved in coordinating zinc. Kruppel-related
proteins form 1 family of zinc finger proteins. See 604749 for
additional information on zinc finger proteins.

CLONING

By screening a human fetal heart cDNA library with a degenerate
oligonucleotide based on the consensus sequence of the C2H2 zinc finger
domain, Wang et al. (1996) cloned 2 novel zinc finger cDNAs, designated
ZNF180 (606740) and ZNF181.

MAPPING

By FISH, Wang et al. (1996) mapped the ZNF180 and ZNF181 genes within a
cluster of zinc finger genes on chromosome 19q13.2.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS; 194050) is a multisystem developmental
disorder caused by the deletion of contiguous genes at chromosome
7q11.23. A common interval that includes as many as 17 genes is deleted
in most patients. Meng et al. (1998) constructed a physical map
encompassing the 1.5-Mb region that is commonly deleted in WBS. They
identified 3 genes within this region, including WBSCR14, which they
designated WS-bHLH. By EST database searching, sequencing, and screening
of a human fetal brain cDNA library, they isolated a partial WBSCR14
cDNA encoding a protein belonging to the basic helix-loop-helix
leucine-zipper family of transcription factors.

De Luis et al. (2000) fully characterized the WBSCR14 gene. They
identified 2 intragenic polymorphic dinucleotide repeats and used them
to verify hemizygosity in WBS patients. They found that the WBSCR14 cDNA
encodes an 852-amino acid protein which, in addition to the bHLH-ZIP
motif, has a bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS). Northern blot
analysis detected a 4.2-kb transcript predominantly in adult liver and
at late stages of fetal development. De Luis et al. (2000) also cloned
the mouse homolog. Given that other bHLH-ZIP proteins are dose sensitive
and based on the putative function of WBSCR14 as a transcription factor,
de Luis et al. (2000) suggested that hemizygosity at this locus may be
involved in some features of WBS.

Kawaguchi et al. (2002) cloned Chrebp from rat liver. The rat Chrebp
protein shares approximately 94% and 82% identity with mouse and human
WBSCR14, respectively.

GENE FUNCTION

Cairo et al. (2001) found that WBSCR14 was expressed in multiple
tissues, including regions of the brain and the intestinal tract.
WBSCR14 formed heterodimers with the bHLH-ZIP protein Mlx (602976) to
bind the DNA sequence CACGTG. Like Max (154950), Mlx has no intrinsic
transcriptional activity, but its association with Mad1 (602686), Mad4,
Mnt (603039), or WBSCR14 can repress E-box-dependent transcription.
Preliminary results suggested a possible role of WBSCR14 in growth
control. The authors hypothesized that the Max-like bHLH-ZIP protein,
Mlx, is a key element of a transcription factor network, and that
WBSCR14 may contribute to some aspects of the WBS pathology.

Kawaguchi et al. (2001) noted that rat Chrebp is essential for
activation of the liver pyruvate kinase gene (PKLR; 609712). They stated
that Chrebp is activated by high glucose and is inhibited by cAMP. By
mutation analysis of mouse Chrebp, Kawaguchi et al. (2001) demonstrated
that the N-terminal NLS and the C-terminal bHLH and leucine zipper
domains were essential for transcription of a reporter gene from the PKL
promoter in transfected rat hepatocytes. These 2 domains were targets
for regulation by cAMP and glucose. Kawaguchi et al. (2001) found that
cAMP-dependent protein kinase (see 601639) phosphorylated ser196 near
the NLS, which inactivated nuclear import of Chrebp, and thr666 near the
bHLH domain, which dissociated Chrebp from DNA and inactivated PKL
transcription. On the other hand, high glucose stimulated
dephosphorylation, leading to translocation of Chrebp from the cytosol
into the nucleus, where dephosphorylation led to DNA binding.

Kawaguchi et al. (2002) found that acetate and fatty acids inhibited the
glucose-induced transcription of PKL in Chrebp-transfected rat
hepatocytes. Inhibition was associated with a significant increase in
cytosolic AMP and activation of AMPK (see 602739). They determined that
AMPK phosphorylated Chrebp on ser568, resulting in loss of DNA binding.

Several endocrine phenotypes, in particular impaired glucose tolerance
and silent diabetes, have been described in Williams-Beuren syndrome. A
heterodimeric complex consisting of WBSCR14 and the MAX-like protein
(MLX; 602976), binds and activates, in a glucose-dependent manner,
carbohydrate response element (ChoRE) motifs in the promoter of
lipogenic enzymes. Merla et al. (2004) identified 5 novel
WBSCR14-interacting proteins, 4 14-3-3 isotypes (beta, 601289; gamma,
605356; zeta, 601288; and theta, 609009) and NIF3L1 (605778), which form
a single polypeptide complex in mammalian cells. WBSCR14 was exported
actively from the nucleus through a CRM1-dependent mechanism. This
translocation was contingent upon the ability to bind 14-3-3. The
authors proposed that through this mechanism, the 14-3-3 isotypes may
directly affect the WBSCR14:MLX complexes, which may activate the
transcription of lipogenic genes.

Herman et al. (2012) reported that adipose tissue GLUT4 (138190)
regulates the expression of CHREBP, a transcriptional regulator of
lipogenic and glycolytic genes. Furthermore, adipose CHREBP is a major
determinant of adipose tissue fatty acid synthesis and systemic insulin
sensitivity. Herman et al. (2012) found a new mechanism for glucose
regulation of CHREBP: glucose-mediated activation of the canonical
CHREBP isoform (CHREBP-alpha) induces expression of a novel, potent
isoform (CHREBP-beta) that is transcribed from an alternative promoter.
CHREBP-beta expression in human adipose tissue predicts insulin
sensitivity.

GENE STRUCTURE

De Luis et al. (2000) determined that the WBSCR14 gene contains 17 exons
and spans 33 kb.

MAPPING

Meng et al. (1998) mapped the WBSCR14 gene to the WBS deletion region on
chromosome 7q11.23. De Luis et al. (2000) mapped the mouse Wbscr14 gene
to chromosome 5 in a region of conserved synteny with human 7q11.23.

600174	TITLE *600174 PHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL TRANSFER PROTEIN, ALPHA; PITPNA
;;PITPN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Phosphatidylinositol transfer protein is a member of a diverse set of
cytosolic phospholipid transfer proteins that are distinguished by their
ability to transfer phospholipids between membranes in vitro (Wirtz,
1991).

CLONING

The rat Pitpna gene encodes a polypeptide of 271 amino acids and is
expressed in a wide range of tissues (Dickeson et al., 1989). The
protein predicted by the human PITPNA gene cloned and sequenced by
Dickeson et al. (1994) showed only 3 amino acid sequence differences
from the rat protein, 2 of which represented conservative substitutions.
Hay and Martin (1993) reported studies suggesting that PITPNA is
identical to priming-specific factor-3, one of the 3 priming factors
involved in the ATP-dependent priming of Ca(2+)-activated secretion. Rat
Pitpna shares 40% amino acid homology over its entire length with the
Drosophila retinal degeneration B (rdgB) protein (Vihtelic et al.,
1993). Flies carrying the rdgB mutation undergo light-enhanced retinal
degeneration.

MAPPING

As a first step toward investigations of possible involvement of the
PITPNA locus in retinal degeneration, Fitzgibbon et al. (1994) mapped
the PITPNA gene to human chromosome 17p13.3 by PCR analysis of a somatic
cell hybrid panel followed by fluorescence in situ hybridization. They
mapped the homologous gene to mouse chromosome 11 by interspecific mouse
backcross mapping.

ANIMAL MODEL

The mouse 'vibrator' (vb) mutation causes an early-onset progressive
action tremor, degeneration of brainstem and spinal cord neurons, and
juvenile death. Hamilton et al. (1997) cloned the vb mutation using an
in vivo positional complementation approach followed by complete
resequencing of the resulting 76-kb critical region in vb and its
progenitor strain. The authors showed that the vb mutation is an
intracisternal A particle retroposon insertion in intron 4 of the Pitpn
gene, causing a 5-fold reduction in Pitpn RNA and protein levels.
Expression of neurofilament light chain (NEFL; 162280) was also reduced
in vb mice, suggesting 1 signaling pathway that may underlie vb
pathology. The vb phenotype was suppressed in 1 intercross. By a
complete genome scan, they mapped a major suppressor locus (Mvb1) to
proximal mouse chromosome 19.

The modifier-of-vibrator-1 locus (Mvb1) controls levels of correctly
processed mRNA from genes mutated by endogenous retrovirus insertions
into introns, including the Pitpn(vb) tremor mutation. By positional
complementation cloning, Floyd et al. (2003) identified Mvb1 as the
nuclear export factor Nxf1 (602647), providing an unexpected link
between the mRNA export receptor and pre-mRNA processing.

By examining lipid profiles, Monaco et al. (2004) observed increased
neutral lipids, including cholesterol esters, triglycerides, and free
fatty acids, in vb/vb liver compared with wildtype. No changes were
detected in vb/vb liver phospholipid content or in the vb/vb brain lipid
profile. Mammary glands of vb/vb mice were significantly underdeveloped
compared with wildtype, and vb/vb mammary fat pads contained brown
rather than white adipose tissue. No defect in phospholipid-mediated
signaling was observed in isolated vb/vb fibroblasts. In Ptpa-null mice,
Monaco et al. (2004) found reduced circulating triglycerides, overall
reduction in body fat, low ATP/ADP ratio, and histologic evidence of
steatosis in liver and duodenal tissue. Monaco et al. (2004) suggested
that reduced Ptpa activity may result in biochemical uncoupling of
mitochondrial fuel metabolism from energy production.

615142	TITLE *615142 KINESIN FAMILY MEMBER 2B; KIF2B
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

KIF2A (602591), KIF2B, and KIF2C (604538) comprise the kinesin-13 family
of microtubule motor proteins, which are characterized by the
localization of the kinesin motor domain in the middle of the
polypeptide. Kinesin-13 proteins are nonmotile and induce microtubule
depolymerization by disassembling tubulin subunits from the polymer end.
KIF2B participates in several key events during mitosis, including
bipolar spindle assembly, cytokinesis, and chromosome movement (Manning
et al., 2007).

CLONING

Using Western blot analysis, Manning et al. (2007) found that KIF2B had
an apparent molecular mass of about 80 kD. KIF2B was highly expressed in
lung, with weaker expression in ovary, heart, kidney, skeletal muscle,
and placenta. Proteins with lower molecular mass were detected in
placenta, skeletal muscle, and spleen. No expression was detected in
brain, liver, or testis. Fluorescence-tagged KIF2B localized to spindle
midzone and midbody in late anaphase and telophase and colocalized with
HEC1 (NDC80; 607272) at kinetochores in prometaphase.

GENE FUNCTION

Using RNA interference in human U2OS and RPE cells, Manning et al.
(2007) found that each of the kinesin-13 family members has a distinct
role during mitosis. MCAK (KIF2C) deficiency resulted in exaggerated
astral microtubule length. KIF2A and KIF2B deficiency resulted in
similar defects, with delayed progression through mitosis, appearance of
monopolar or disorganized spindles, and increased number of binucleated
or dead cells. However, knockdown of KIF2B, but not KIF2A, reduced the
poleward kinetochore force acting on chromosomes. Knockdown of KIF2B did
not disrupt the pole localization of KIF2A or the centromere and spindle
localization of MCAK.

MAPPING

Manning et al. (2007) stated that the KIF2B gene maps to chromosome
17q22.

611106	TITLE *611106 ZINC FINGER CCCH DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 12D; ZC3H12D
;;p34;;
C6ORF95;;
MCPIP4
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ZC3H12D is a CCCH-type zinc finger protein, like TTP (ZFP36; 190700),
ZAP (ZC3HAV1; 607312), and ROQUIN (RC3H1; 609424), whereas most
mammalian zinc finger proteins are CCHH- or CCCC-type proteins. Liang et
al. (2008) found that ZC3H12B, also known as MCPIP2, and other MCPIP
proteins, MCPIP1 (ZC3H12A; 610562), MCPIP2 (ZC3H12B; 300889), and MCPIP3
(ZC3H12C; 615001), regulate macrophage activation.

CLONING

Wang et al. (2007) reported frequent loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on
chromosome 6q25.1 in sporadic lung tumors (211980) and determined a
2.2-Mb minimum region of LOH. By direct sequencing and SNP genotyping
using genomic DNAs from lung cancer pedigrees showing linkage to this
region, they identified a novel candidate gene, ZC3H12D, and identified
a nonsynonymous A/G SNP at codon 106 that changes a lysine to an
arginine. The deduced 321-amino acid protein has a predicted molecular
mass of 34 kD and contains a zinc finger CCCH (C-x8-C-x5-C-x3-H) motif.
The protein shares significant blocks of conservation with homologs in
other mammals and in lower organisms such as zebrafish and Drosophila.

By database searching for genes similar to MCPIP1, Liang et al. (2008)
identified MCPIP4, a 527-amino acid protein containing a single central
CCCH-type zinc finger and no other identifiable motifs. Mouse
macrophages treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), but not Ifng
(147570), showed some induction of MCPIP4 by Northern blot analysis.

GENE FUNCTION

Wang et al. (2007) performed in vitro clonogenic and in vivo nude mouse
studies which showed that overexpression of the ZC3H12D 106A allele
exerts tumor suppressor function compared with the G allele.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Wang et al. (2007) found that approximately 73% (8/11) of heterozygous
lung cancer tissues with LOH and the A/G SNP also exhibited loss of the
A allele. Wang et al. (2007) noted that the ZC3H12D gene was located
within a region containing a lung cancer susceptibility locus (608935),
but association studies of the A/G SNP demonstrated no association
between the less frequent 106G (arginine) allele and lung cancer
susceptibility in the families studied by Bailey-Wilson et al. (2004).

GENE STRUCTURE

Wang et al. (2007) determined that the ZC3H12D gene contains 6 coding
exons and 2 untranslated exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Wang et al. (2007) mapped the ZC3H12D gene
to chromosome 6q25.1 (build 36.2).

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

To identify proteins that modulate AKT activity, Du et al. (2003) used a
yeast 2-hybrid assay to screen for proteins from a preadipocyte cDNA
library that interacted with an AKT1 (164730) construct lacking the
N-terminal pleckstrin homology domain. They identified a 354-amino acid
protein previously identified as a neuronal cell death-inducible
putative protein kinase (NIPK) in the rat and designated in the GenBank
database as TRB3 (GenBank GENBANK AY247738). TRB3 and its related family
members TRB1 (TRIB1; 609461) and TRB2 (TRIB2; 609462) show 45% sequence
identity overall and bear strong resemblances to 'tribbles,' a
Drosophila protein that inhibits mitosis early in development by binding
to the CDC25 homolog 'string' and promoting its ubiquitination and
proteasome-mediated degradation. Like tribbles, TRB family members have
a truncated kinase domain that lacks an adenosine 5-prime-triphosphate
binding site (GXGXXG) and contains a variant catalytic core motif (TRB3:
amino acids 175 to 182; LRDLKLRR vs consensus: HRDLKPEN).
Correspondingly, Tribbles and its mammalian counterparts lack detectable
kinase activity by in vitro kinase assay.

Wu et al. (2003) cloned TRIB3, which they designated SINK, from a human
B-cell cDNA library. The deduced 358-amino acid protein contains a
kinase-like domain and shares significant homology with serine/threonine
protein kinases. Northern blot analysis detected SINK mRNA in spleen,
thymus, prostate, liver, and pancreas, but not in other tissues
examined.

By searching databases for sequences similar to TRIB1, Kiss-Toth et al.
(2004) identified TRIB3. Quantitative real-time PCR of several tissues
detected highest TRIB3 expression in pancreas, peripheral blood
leukocytes, and bone marrow.

GENE FUNCTION

Du et al. (2003) demonstrated that TRB3 functions as a negative
modulator of AKT. TRB3 expression is induced in liver under fasting
conditions, and TRB3 disrupts insulin signaling by binding directly to
AKT and blocking activation of the kinase. Amounts of TRB3 RNA and
protein were increased in livers of db/db (see LEPR, 601007) diabetic
mice compared with those of wildtype mice. Hepatic overexpression of
TRB3 in amounts comparable to those in db/db mice promoted hyperglycemia
and glucose intolerance. Du et al. (2003) concluded that by interfering
with AKT activation, TRB3 contributes to insulin resistance in
individuals with susceptibility to type 2 diabetes (125853).

Wu et al. (2003) found that overexpression of SINK in human embryonic
kidney cells inhibited NFKB (see 164011)-dependent transcription induced
by TNF (191160) stimulation or by its downstream signaling proteins, but
it did not inhibit NFKB translocation to the nucleus or binding of NFKB
to DNA. Coimmunoprecipitation and in vitro kinase assays indicated that
SINK specifically interacted with the NFKB transactivator p65 (RELA;
164014) and inhibited p65 phosphorylation. Consistent with its role in
inhibiting NFKB-dependent transcription, SINK also sensitized cells to
apoptosis induced by TNF and TRAIL (TNFSF10; 603598). Wu et al. (2003)
concluded that SINK is involved in a negative feedback control pathway
of NFKB-induced gene expression.

Kiss-Toth et al. (2004) found that overexpression of TRIB3 in HeLa cells
inhibited AP1 (165160) activity and blocked oncogenic Ras
(190020)-driven AP1 activation. ERK (see 601795) activation was enhanced
by TRIB3, but only at low TRIB3 doses. Coimmunoprecipitation and yeast
2-hybrid assays showed that MEK1 (MAP2K1; 176872) interacted with both
TRIB1 and TRIB3, and MKK7 (MAP2K7; 603014) interacted specifically with
TRIB3. Cotransfection of MKK7 enhanced the level of TRIB3, indicating
that the TRIB-MAPKK interaction stabilized TRIB3.

During fasting, increased concentrations of circulating catecholamines
promote the mobilization of lipid stores from adipose tissue in part by
phosphorylating and inactivating acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC; see
200350), the rate-limiting enzyme in fatty acid synthesis. Qi et al.
(2006) described a parallel pathway, in which the pseudokinase TRB3,
whose abundance is increased during fasting, stimulates lipolysis by
triggering the degradation of ACC in adipose tissue. TRB3 promoted ACC
ubiquitination through an association with the E3 ubiquitin ligase
constitutive photomorphogenic protein-1 (COP1; 608067). Indeed, Qi et
al. (2006) found that adipocytes deficient in TRB3 accumulated larger
amounts of ACC protein than did wildtype cells. Because transgenic mice
expressing TRB3 in adipose tissue are protected from diet-induced
obesity due to enhanced fatty acid oxidation, Qi et al. (2006) concluded
that their results demonstrated how phosphorylation and ubiquitination
pathways converge on a key regulator of lipid metabolism to maintain
energy homeostasis.

Using purified Helicobacter pylori lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and TLR2
(603028)-positive and -negative stomach cancer cell lines, Smith et al.
(2011) showed that H. pylori LPS induced NF-kappa-B (see 164011)
activation and IL8 (146930) production via TLR2 and multiple downstream
signaling components. H. pylori LPS also significantly decreased TRIB3
expression, and knockdown of TRIB3 enhanced the TLR2-mediated activating
properties of H. pylori LPS. TRIB3 expression was also decreased by H.
pylori through an LPS-independent mechanism via reduced CHOP (DDIT3;
126337) and ATF4 (604064) expression, resulting in NF-kappa-B activation
and chemokine induction. Smith et al. (2011) concluded that TRIB3
modulation by H. pylori and/or its products may be an important
mechanism of H. pylori-associated pathogenesis.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the TRIB3
gene to chromosome 20 (TMAP WI-15969).

606962	TITLE *606962 WW DOMAIN-BINDING PROTEIN 2; WBP2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The globular WW domain is composed of 38 to 40 semiconserved amino acids
shared by proteins of diverse functions including structural,
regulatory, and signaling proteins. The domain is involved in mediating
protein-protein interactions through the binding of polyproline ligands.
Thus, its function is similar to that of the Src homology-3 (SH3)
domain.

CLONING

Using a functional screen of a mouse cDNA expression library, Chen and
Sudol (1995) cloned 2 ligands, which they designated Wbp1 (606961) and
Wpb2, that bound to the WW domain of human Yes kinase-associated protein
(YAP; 606608). Sequence comparison showed no homology between the 2
proteins except in a short proline-rich region containing the invariant
residues PPPPY, which the authors designated the PY motif. Wbp1 contains
a single PY motif, whereas Wbp2 contains 2 in the forward orientation
and 1 in the reverse orientation. A structural similarity between the WW
and SH3 domains is a hydrophobic core of conserved aromatic residues
surrounded by beta loops containing charged amino acids. Northern blot
analysis of multiple human tissues detected Northern blot analysis of
multiple human tissues revealed ubiquitous expression of a 2.0-kb WBP2
transcript. Using the partial mouse cDNA as probe, Chen et al. (1997)
cloned WBP2 from a human lung fibroblast cDNA library. The cDNA encodes
a deduced 268-amino acid protein that shares 94% sequence identity with
the mouse protein.

GENE FUNCTION

Since Wbp1 contains only a single PY motif, Chen and Sudol (1995) used
this as a model protein to characterize interaction between the PY and
WW domains. By mutagenesis followed by Western ligand blot analysis,
they established that all residues of the PY motif engage in binding the
WW domain, and that P2, P3, and Y5 are crucial but not entirely
sufficient for optimal binding. Chen et al. (1997) confirmed and refined
the consensus PY motif as XPPXW.

MAPPING

By FISH, Chen et al. (1997) mapped the WBP2 gene to chromosome 17q25.

603322	TITLE *603322 NADH-UBIQUINONE OXIDOREDUCTASE 1 BETA SUBCOMPLEX, 6; NDUFB6
;;COMPLEX I, MITOCHONDRIAL RESPIRATORY CHAIN, B17 SUBUNIT; B17
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase), the first multisubunit
enzyme complex of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, has about 43
subunits with a combined molecular mass of 970 kD. Of these, 7 subunits
are encoded by the mitochondrial genome (ND1-6, ND4L). The remaining
subunits are encoded by the nuclear genome (Smeitink et al., 1998)

CLONING

Smeitink et al. (1998) provided a table of 15 known nuclear subunits and
reported the cloning of an additional subunit, B17. The B17 cDNA encodes
a protein of 128 amino acids with a calculated relative mass of 15.5 kD.
There was 82.7% and 78.1% homology, respectively, at the cDNA and amino
acid levels with the bovine counterpart. Multi-tissue dot blots showed
ubiquitous expression of B17 mRNA, with relatively higher expression in
tissues known for their high energy demands. Of these, kidney showed the
highest expression. Mutation analysis of the subunit revealed no
mutations or polymorphisms in 20 patients with isolated enzymatic
complex I deficiency in cultured skin fibroblasts.

Smeitink and van den Heuvel (1999) reviewed the available molecular data
regarding the human nuclear-encoding complex I subunits.

MAPPING

By searching the GenBank STS database using the cDNA sequence of the
human B17 subunit, Smeitink et al. (1998) mapped the NDUFB6 gene
(GenBank GENBANK G30177) to chromosome 2. However, by radiation hybrid
analysis, Emahazion et al. (1998) mapped the NDUFB6 gene to 9p13.2.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

NDUFB6 is among the set of OXPHOS genes showing significant reduction in
muscle from patients with type 2 diabetes (125853) compared with healthy
control subjects (Mootha et al., 2003; see 604517). In a study of young
and elderly twins with and without type 2 diabetes, Ling et al. (2007)
found that expression of NDUFB6 in skeletal muscle decreased with age. A
-544A-G polymorphism in the NDUFB6 promoter region (dbSNP rs629566) that
creates a possible DNA methylation site was associated with a decline in
muscle NDUFB6 expression with age; increased DNA methylation was found
in the promoter of elderly but not young subjects carrying the G/G
genotype. The degree of DNA methylation correlated negatively with
muscle NDUFB6 expression, which, in turn, was associated with insulin
sensitivity. Ling et al. (2007) suggested that genetic and epigenetic
factors may interact to increase age-dependent susceptibility to insulin
resistance.

610082	TITLE *610082 MYOSIN REGULATORY LIGHT CHAIN-INTERACTING PROTEIN; MYLIP
;;MIR;;
INDUCIBLE DEGRADER OF THE LOW DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN RECEPTOR; IDOL
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MYLIP belongs to the ezrin (VIL2; 123900)-radixin (RDX; 179410)-moesin
(MSN; 309845) (ERM) family of cytoskeletal effector proteins that link
actin to membrane-bound proteins at the cell surface (Olsson et al.,
1999).

CLONING

By database analysis and PCR of a fetal brain cDNA library, Olsson et
al. (1999) cloned MYLIP, which they called MIR. The deduced 445-amino
acid protein contains an N-terminal ERM homology domain and a C-terminal
RING finger domain. Northern blot analysis detected a 3-kb MIR
transcript in all human tissues examined, with prominent expression in
placenta and fetal lung. Endogenous and fluorescence-tagged MIR showed a
punctate, predominantly cytoplasmic distribution in COS-7 cells.

Using immunohistochemical analysis, Olsson et al. (2000) found that Mir
was expressed in rat embryonic hippocampal neuronal cell bodies and
growth cones. In rat PC12 neural precursor cells, Mir immunoreactivity
was observed in neurites and in large-sized growth cones induced by Ngf
(NGFB; 162030) treatment.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Olsson et al. (1999) found that MIR
interacted directly with myosin regulatory light chain B (MRLC2;
609211). Coimmunoprecipitation of cotransfected COS-7 cells confirmed
the interaction. In rat PC12 cells, MIR overexpression inhibited
NGF-induced neurite outgrowth, but it did not alter Trka (NTRK1; 191315)
phosphorylation by NGF, suggesting MIR is downstream of TRKA.

Bornhauser et al. (2003) found that MIR and MSAP (TMEM4; 605861)
interacted, but only if both proteins were full length. In rodent
neuronal precursor cell lines, MIR reduced the stimulatory effect of
MSAP overexpression on neurite outgrowth. MIR overexpression also
resulted in ubiquitination of MRLC2, and this ubiquitination could be
counteracted by MSAP overexpression.

Bornhauser et al. (2003) showed that the ERM domain of MIR increased the
solubility of the full-length protein, whereas the RING domain was
involved in protein-protein interactions and changes in cellular
localization. The RING domain was responsible for the inhibitory
activity of MIR on neurite outgrowth. Stability of the MIR protein was
regulated by ubiquitination, including autoubiquitination, which was
dependent upon cys387 within the RING domain.

Zelcer et al. (2009) demonstrated that the sterol-responsive nuclear
liver X receptor (LXR) (see 600380) helps maintain cholesterol
homeostasis, not only through promotion of cholesterol efflux but also
through suppression of LDL uptake. LXR inhibits the LDLR (606945)
pathway through the transcriptional induction of IDOL (MYLIP), an E3
ubiquitin ligase that triggers ubiquitination of the LDLR on its
cytoplasmic domain, thereby targeting it for degradation. LXR ligand
reduced, whereas LXR knockout increased, LDLR protein levels in vivo in
a tissue-selective manner. IDOL knockdown in hepatocytes increased LDLR
protein levels and promoted LDL uptake. Conversely, Zelcer et al. (2009)
found that adenovirus-mediated expression of IDOL in mouse liver
promoted LDLR degradation and elevated plasma LDL levels. Zelcer et al.
(2009) concluded that the LXR-IDOL-LDLR axis defines a complementary
pathway to sterol response element-binding proteins for sterol
regulation of cholesterol uptake.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Olsson et al. (2000) mapped the MYLIP gene
to chromosome 6p23-p22.3.

;;NTE-LIKE 1; NTEL1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Human patatin-like phospholipases, such as PNPLA7, have been implicated
in regulation of adipocyte differentiation and have been induced by
metabolic stimuli (Wilson et al., 2006).

CLONING

By database analysis, followed by screening of human EST databases,
Wilson et al. (2006) identified PNPLA7. The deduced 1,317-amino acid
protein has a patatin-like domain, a predicted transmembrane domain,
cyclic nucleotide binding sites, a glycosaminoglycan attachment site, 3
tyrosine kinase phosphorylation sites, and a cell attachment sequence.
PNPLA7 shares approximately 60% sequence identity with PNPLA6 (603197).
Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that PNPLA7 was predominantly
expressed in prostate, pancreas, and adipose tissue.

604676	TITLE *604676 HLA COMPLEX P5 GENE; HCP5
;;MAJOR HISTOCOMPATIBILITY COMPLEX, CLASS I, GENE P5-1;;
P5-1;;
D6S2650E
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is a genomic region on
chromosome 6p21.3 that is characterized by the presence of many
duplicated gene families. By screening various tissues and cell lines
with probes derived from an MHC class I YAC, Vernet et al. (1993)
detected a 2.5-kb mRNA transcript in B-cell lines, NK cell lines,
activated T cells, and normal spleen. Low stringency probing of genomic
DNA revealed multiple copies of a sequence, which the authors termed P5,
clustered near HLA-A (142800). One member of the multicopy gene family,
designated P5-1, encodes a 219-amino acid protein. Vernet et al. (1993)
showed that transcription of P5-1 is restricted to lymphoid tissues.
Avoustin et al. (1994) determined that P5-1 cDNA represents a chimeric
transcript in which the first exon of an HLA class I gene has fused to
an unrelated sequence.

Using computer and dot blot analysis, Kulski and Dawkins (1999) found
that P5 family members are related in sequence, particularly within the
pol and LTR regions to the human endogenous retroviruses HERV-L and
HERV-16 (see HHLA1, 604109). The authors noted that unlike the mRNA
sequences expressed by HLA class I genes, both P5-1 cDNA and HERV
sequences are characterized by many stop codons and short putative
coding regions.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Association With Drug-Induced Liver Injury Due To Flucloxacillin

In a genomewide association study of 51 patients with
flucloxacillin-induced liver injury and 282 controls, Daly et al. (2009)
found an association with dbSNP rs2395029 (p = 8.7 x 10(-33)) in the
HCP5 gene within the MHC region. The SNP is in complete linkage
disequilibrium with HLA-B*5701 (142830.0003). Further MHC genotyping of
64 flucloxacillin-tolerant controls confirmed the association with
HLA-B*5701 (odds ratio of 80.6; p = 9.0 x 10(-19)). The association was
replicated in a second cohort of 23 patients. In HLA-B*5701 carriers,
dbSNP rs10937275 in the ST6GAL1 (109675) gene on chromosome 3q also
showed genomewide significance (odds ratio of 4.1; p = 1.4 x 10(-8)).

- Association with Psoriasis/Psoriatic Arthritis

In a genomewide association study of 223 U.S. patients with psoriasis
(see 177900), including 91 with psoriatic arthritis (see 607507), and
519 European controls, followed by replication in a U.K. cohort of 576
patients with psoriatic arthritis and 480 controls and another U.S.
cohort of 577 patients with psoriasis and 737 controls, Liu et al.
(2008) identified association between dbSNP rs2395029, which encodes a
G2V polymorphism in the HCP5 gene, and psoriasis (p = 2.13 x 10(-26);
OR, 4.1) in the combined U.S. sample and psoriatic arthritis (p = 1.86 x
10(-10); OR, 3.2) in the U.K. sample. Conditioning upon dbSNP
rs10484554, which is 34.7 kb upstream of the HLA-C (142840) start site
and strongly correlated with the PSORS1 SNP dbSNP rs10456057, the p
value of dbSNP rs2395029 was still significant (p = 7 x 10(-10)),
indicating its effect is likely to be independent.

300512	TITLE *300512 WD REPEAT-CONTAINING PROTEIN 13; WDR13
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By screening a human testis cDNA library, Singh et al. (2003) cloned
WDR13. The deduced 485-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular
mass of 53 kD. The N-terminal domain of WDR13 contains several consensus
phosphorylation sites, and the C terminus contains 6 WD repeats. Singh
et al. (2003) also identified a splice variant that encodes a 393-amino
acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 43 kD. Northern blot
analysis detected variable expression of transcripts at about 3.0 and
2.0 kb in all tissues examined. RNA dot blot analysis confirmed
widespread expression in adult and fetal tissues. Transfection of the
WDR13 splice variants in Chinese hamster ovary cells demonstrated
expression of the 53-kD isoform in the nucleus and expression of the
43-kD isoform in both cytoplasm and nucleus.

GENE STRUCTURE

Singh et al. (2003) determined that the WDR13 gene contains 9 exons and
spans 7.3 kb. The promoter region contains a GC box and binding sites
for AP1 (see JUN, 165160), SP1 (189906), and GATA1 (305371).

MAPPING

By FISH and genomic sequence analysis, Singh et al. (2003) mapped the
WDR13 gene to chromosome Xp11.23.

;;TENASCIN X; TNX;;
HEXABRACHION-LIKE; HXBL
TENASCIN XB, ISOFORM 1, INCLUDED; TNXB1, INCLUDED;;
TENASCIN XB, ISOFORM 2, INCLUDED; TNXB2, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION The tenascins are a family of extracellular matrix proteins (ECMs); see
187380. The first member, termed tenascin or hexabrachion (TNC; 187380),
attracted attention because of its prominent expression during tissue
interactions in embryogenesis and its overexpression in many tumors.

CLONING

By screening a fetal adrenal cDNA library with a CYP21 (613815) probe,
Morel et al. (1989) obtained a partial cDNA corresponding to a gene on
the opposite strand of CYP21. Northern blot analysis revealed expression
of 3.5- and 1.8-kb transcripts in adult adrenal and a Leydig cell
adenoma. Xu and Doolittle (1990) determined that tenascin and the gene
product identified by Morel et al. (1989) have the same type of
fibronectin (135600) repeats. Gitelman et al. (1992) determined that the
functional gene, which they termed XB, is localized opposite CYP21B and
not the pseudogene CYP21A.

Matsumoto et al. (1992) also identified a tenascin-like gene in the
human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class III region.
Chromosome walking and sequencing in the region centromeric of CYP21
disclosed a cluster of fibronectin type III repeats. Such repeats
consist of approximately 90 amino acids and exist in a wide range of
protein species. Homology searches in protein databases showed that the
repeats had the highest homology with those of human tenascin.

By screening genomic libraries and multiple cDNA libraries, RT-PCR, and
5-prime RACE, Bristow et al. (1993) cloned the XB gene. Sequence
analysis of the estimated 3,816-amino acid XB gene product, which the
authors termed TNX, predicted the presence of 5 N-linked glycosylation
sites and multiple EFG and fibronectin type III repeats. RNase
protection analysis detected variable expression in all tissues tested,
with highest levels in fetal testis and fetal smooth, striated, and
cardiac muscle. In situ hybridization demonstrated homogeneous
expression of TNX in adult adrenal cortex.

Matsumoto et al. (1994) isolated a cDNA encoding mouse Tnx. They found
that the subunit molecular size of Tnx is approximately 500 kD,
suggesting that the protein may contain up to 40 fibronectin type III
repeats, making it the largest tenascin family member. The Tnx mRNA and
protein were predominantly expressed in heart and skeletal muscle, but
low levels of the mRNA were found in most tissues. Immunostaining showed
that the Tnx protein is associated with the extracellular matrix of the
muscle tissues and with blood vessels in all tissues analyzed. Although
the gene lies in the MHC class III region, it is not expressed in
lymphoid organs, except for the staining around blood vessels.

Tee et al. (1995) stated that in the compact region of the human class
III major histocompatibility locus on 6p21.3, genes for C4A (120810),
C4B (120820), and steroid 21-hydroxylase occur in 1 transcriptional
orientation, whereas the TNX gene overlaps the last exon of the CYP21
gene on the opposite strand of DNA in the opposite transcriptional
orientation. This complex locus is duplicated into A and B loci, so that
the orientation is 5-prime-C4A-21A-TNXA-C4B-21B-TNXB-3-prime. Although a
duplication event truncated the 65-kb TNXB gene to a 4.5-kb TNXA gene,
the TNXA gene is transcriptionally active in the adrenal cortex. To
examine the basis of the tissue-specific expression of TNXA and C4B, Tee
et al. (1995) cloned the 1763-bp region that lies between the cap sites
for TNXA and C4B and analyzed its promoter activity in both the TNXA and
the C4 orientations. Transcriptionally active, liver-specific sequences
lie within the first 75 to 138 bp from the C4B cap site, and weaker
transcriptional elements lie within 128 bp of the TNXA cap site that
function in both liver and adrenal cells. Because these elements 128 bp
upstream from the TNXA cap site are perfectly preserved in the TNXB
gene, Tee et al. (1995) sought to determine whether a transcript similar
to TNXA arises within the TNXB gene. RNase protection assays, cDNA
cloning, and RT-PCR showed that adrenal cells contain a novel
transcript, termed short XB (XB-S) by them, which has the same open
reading frame as the gene encoding tenascin-XA. Cell-free translation
and immunoblotting showed that this transcript encodes a novel 74-kD
XB-S protein that is identical to the C-terminal 673 residues of
tenascin-X. Because this protein consists solely of fibronectin type III
repeats and a fibrinogen-like domain, it appears to correspond to an
evolutionary precursor of the tenascin family of extracellular matrix
proteins.

Speek et al. (1996) identified a TNX promoter specific for transcription
in fetal adrenal and muscle tissue, as well as 2 promoters further
upstream specific for transcription in adrenocortical carcinoma cells.
Unlike TNC and TNR (601995), no alternative splicing in the
fibronectin-like domains could be detected by 5-prime RACE and RNase
protection analysis.

Ikuta et al. (1998) determined that the mouse and human TNX proteins are
73% identical. Mouse Tnx has an N-terminal domain containing cysteine
residues and 4 heptad repeats, followed by 18.5 EGF repeats, 31
fibronectin III repeats, and a C-terminal fibrinogen-like motif. Ikuta
et al. (1998) established that the human TNX protein contains 4,267
amino acids and has 33 fibronectin III repeats.

GENE STRUCTURE

By sequencing phage and cosmid clones and cDNA fragments, Bristow et al.
(1993) estimated that the TNX gene contains at least 39 exons and spans
65 kb. Speek et al. (1996) identified an additional exon 10 kb upstream
from the previously known exons. They noted that the TNX gene appears to
be unique in having both its 5-prime and 3-prime ends buried in other
genes.

In a comparative analysis of the mouse Tnx gene and the human TNX gene,
Ikuta et al. (1998) determined that mouse and human introns 1, 4, and 6
are highly conserved. The mouse Tnx gene has 43 exons.

MAPPING

Tee et al. (1995) stated that in the compact region of the human class
III major histocompatibility locus on 6p21.3, genes for C4 and steroid
21-hydroxylase occur in 1 transcriptional orientation, while the TNX
gene overlaps the last exon of the CYP21 gene on the opposite strand of
DNA in the opposite transcriptional orientation. This complex locus is
duplicated into A and B loci, so that the orientation is
5-prime-C4A-21A-TNXA-C4B-21B-TNXB-3-prime.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Burch et al. (1996) described a 25-year-old male with congenital adrenal
hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency, associated with an
Ehlers-Danlos type II (130010)-like phenotype (consisting of
hyperextensible skin and joints, patellar chondromalacia, and easy
bruising; see 606408). The patient was studied for a possible contiguous
gene syndrome inasmuch as the TNX gene is encoded by a gene overlapping
the opposite strand of the 21-hydroxylase B gene, CYP21. Western
blotting of heparin-Sepharose concentrated fibroblast-conditioned medium
with anti-human TNX antiserum showed no TNX in samples from the proband
and reduced amounts of TNX in conditioned medium from both parents
compared to controls. A 30-kb deletion (600985.0001) was found in the
proband and his father resulting in loss of the CYP21 gene and creation
of a hybrid gene between TNX and the partially duplicated TNX gene
(called XA by them) with early termination of TNX translation. The
nature of the molecular lesion in the proband's second TNX and CYP21
alleles was unknown. Burch et al. (1996) concluded that the patient's
Ehlers-Danlos phenotype was due to loss of TNX and represented the first
tenascin-related disease.

In their full report, Burch et al. (1997) stated that atypical
histologic findings suggested a novel mechanism of disease in their
proband: the most striking findings were abnormal elastin (130160)
bodies beneath the dermal-epidermal junction, a diffuse increase in
perivascular matrix, and uneven packing of the myelin sheaths of
peripheral nerves. TNX is a 100-kb gene overlapping the 3-prime
untranslated region of the CYP21B gene. The truncated XA gene is a
partially duplicated TNX that occurred in the primordial duplication
event involving this region of 6p. XA and TNX are at least 99%
identical, but XA is transcribed solely in the adrenal gland and
contains a 121-bp deletion that prematurely closes the reading frame
that corresponds to TNX. Since the coding regions of TNX and CYP21B do
not overlap, single point mutations are unlikely to disrupt the function
of both genes. Homologous recombination frequently produces deletion of
the CYP21B locus, but no deletion extending into TNX had been described.
However, recombination between the 5-prime end of XA and the homologous
point in TNX would delete CYP21B and create a TNX/XA fusion gene that
carries the internal deletion normally found in XA, thereby truncating
the TNX open reading frame. Erickson (1997) pointed out that, unlike the
tenascin gene knockout mice, which showed no obvious defect in
connective tissue or in wound healing (Saga et al., 1992), the human
'experiment of nature' indicates a vital role for TNX.

To investigate the role of tenascins in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome,
Schalkwijk et al. (2001) screened serum samples from 151 patients with
the classic (see 130000), hypermobility (130020), or vascular (130050)
types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome for the presence of tenascin-X and
tenascin-C by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The same assays were
done in 75 patients with psoriasis, 93 patients with rheumatoid
arthritis, and 21 healthy persons. In all subjects the authors examined
the expression of tenascins and type V collagen in skin by
immunohistochemical methods, and the TNX gene was sequenced. Absence of
tenascin-X from the serum was found in 5 unrelated patients, all of whom
had Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Expression of tenascin-C and type V collagen
was normal in these 5 patients. All 5 had hypermobile joints,
hyperelastic skin, and easy bruising, without atrophic scarring. The
authors identified mutations in the TNX gene in all 5 of these patients:
1 had a homozygous deletion, 1 was heterozygous for the same deletion,
and 3 others were homozygous for truncating point mutations, confirming
a causative role for tenascin-X in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and a
recessive pattern of inheritance. None of the parents of the 5 patients
with tenascin-X deficiency were related, and none of the 4 parents
available for study had clinical signs of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.

The gene for steroid 21-hydroxylase deficiency, the adjacent complement
C4 gene, and parts of the flanking genes serine/threonine protein
kinase-19 (STK19; 604977) and TNXB constitute a tandemly duplicated
arrangement. Koppens et al. (2002) determined that apparent large-scale
gene conversions accounted for the defect in 9 of 77 chromosomes in a
group of patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to steroid
21-hydroxylase deficiency. They further showed that 4 of 9 'conversions'
extended into TNXB. This implies that approximately 1 in every 10
steroid 21-hydroxylase deficiency patients is a carrier of tenascin-X
deficiency.

Zweers et al. (2003) demonstrated that haploinsufficiency of the TNXB
gene, caused by heterozygosity for a 30-kb deletion (600985.0001),
results in the hypermobility type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.

- Association with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus

For discussion of an association between variation in the TNXB gene and
systemic lupus erythematosus, see SLE (152700).

ANIMAL MODEL

Because TNXB is the first Ehlers-Danlos syndrome gene that does not
encode a fibrillar collagen or collagen-modifying enzyme, Mao and
Bristow (2001) suggested that tenascin-X may regulate collagen synthesis
or deposition. To test this hypothesis, Mao et al. (2002) inactivated
Tnxb in mice. Tnxb -/- mice showed progressive skin hyperextensibility,
similar to that of individuals with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.
Biomechanical testing confirmed increased deformability and reduced
tensile strength of their skin. The skin of Tnxb -/- mice was
histologically normal, but its collagen content was significantly
reduced. At the ultrastructural level, collagen fibrils of Tnxb -/- mice
were of normal size and shape, but the density of fibrils in their skin
was reduced, commensurate with the reduction in collagen content.
Studies of cultured dermal fibroblasts showed that although synthesis of
collagen I by Tnxb -/- and wildtype cells was similar, Tnxb -/-
fibroblasts failed to deposit collagen I into cell-associated matrix.
This study confirmed a causative role for TNXB in human Ehlers-Danlos
syndrome and suggested that tenascin-X is an essential regulator of
collagen deposition by dermal fibroblasts.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
EHLERS-DANLOS-LIKE SYNDROME DUE TO TENASCIN-X DEFICIENCY
EHLERS-DANLOS SYNDROME, HYPERMOBILITY TYPE, INCLUDED
TNXB, 30-KB DEL

Burch et al. (1996, 1997) described a patient with Ehlers-Danlos
syndrome (606408) combined with congenital adrenal hyperplasia resulting
from a 30-kb deletion in 6p21.3, which removed the functional
21-hydroxylase gene (CYP21; 613815) and produced partial duplication of
the TNX gene, resulting in a nonfunctional fusion gene. The patient
described by Burch et al. (1996, 1997) was referred to as the index
patient by Schalkwijk et al. (2001) and was heterozygous for the 30-kb
deletion. Patient 3 of a series of 5 patients with Ehlers-Danlos
syndrome identified by Schalkwijk et al. (2001) was homozygous for this
deletion, which explained both the presence of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome
and congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Both her parents and 2 sibs were
heterozygous for the deletion and were clinically normal, providing
evidence of recessive inheritance in this family. Patient 2 of
Schalkwijk et al. (2001) was heterozygous for the 30-kb deletion and did
not have congenital adrenal hyperplasia. They were unable to identify a
second TNX mutation in patient 2 and suggested that this patient, like
the index patient (Burch et al., 1997), may have had a mutation in
factors, not yet defined, that regulate the tenascin-X gene expression.

Zweers et al. (2003) demonstrated that haploinsufficiency of TNXB
resulting from heterozygosity for the 30-kb deletion results in the
hypermobility form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS III; 130020). They
measured serum TNX levels by ELISA in an unselected cohort of 80
patients with EDS III who were recruited through a Dutch organization
for EDS patients. In all patients, the diagnosis of EDS III was made by
a medical specialist, and approximately 90% were female. In 6 of these
patients (7.5%), all female, serum TNX levels were more than 2.5 S.D.
below the mean for unaffected individuals. Clinically, patients with
reduced TNX levels showed hypermobile joints, often associated with
joint subluxations and chronic musculoskeletal pain. Patients with
haploinsufficiency did not have skin hyperextensibility and lacked the
easy bruising seen in patients with complete TNX deficiency. In
addition, TNXB haploinsufficiency was autosomal dominant. Zweers et al.
(2003) found that 1 of these 6 patients had the 30-kb deletion, which
created a fusion gene of TNXB and XA, a partial duplicate of TNXB. The
XA gene has an internal deletion that truncates its open reading frame,
rendering it and the fusion gene nonfunctional (Gitelman et al., 1992).
The deleted allele also lacked CYP21 (613815).

.0002
EHLERS-DANLOS-LIKE SYNDROME DUE TO TENASCIN-X DEFICIENCY
EHLERS-DANLOS SYNDROME, HYPERMOBILITY TYPE, INCLUDED
TNXB, 2-BP DEL, 56063AA

In a patient with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (606408), Schalkwijk et al.
(2001) identified a homozygous 2-bp deletion, 56063delAA, in exon 8 of
the TNXB gene. The 2-bp deletion altered the open reading frame,
affecting amino acids 1184 through 1230, after which a premature stop
codon was encountered. The patient's clinically normal father was
heterozygous for the deletion; the mother could not be studied. One
sister carried the deletion. An unrelated patient was also homozygous
for this mutation, but her parents were unavailable for study.

In a patient with the hypermobility type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome
(130020), Zweers et al. (2003) identified heterozygosity for the
56063delAA mutation.

.0003
EHLERS-DANLOS-LIKE SYNDROME DUE TO TENASCIN-X DEFICIENCY
TNXB, 2-BP INS, 44906GT

In a patient with recessive Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (606408), Schalkwijk
et al. (2001) identified a homozygous 2-bp insertion, 44906insGT, in
exon 3 of the TNXB gene. The insertion of GT replaced the glutamic acid
residue at position 707 with a stop codon. Additional family members
were not available for study.

.0004
EHLERS-DANLOS SYNDROME, HYPERMOBILITY TYPE
TNXB, VAL1195MET

In a patient with the hypermobility type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome
(130020) and normal TNX serum levels, Zweers et al. (2005) identified a
heterozygous 3583A-G transition in the TNXB gene, resulting in a
val1195-to-met (V1195M) substitution. The V1195M mutation occurs in a
highly conserved region and was not identified in 96 control
individuals. Skin biopsy of the patient showed a significant increase in
elastic fiber length. The authors concluded that missense mutations in
the TNXB gene are also disease-causing.

;;G PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTOR STRL33; STRL33;;
BONZO
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Seven-transmembrane domain, G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are
involved in signaling in response to a diverse array of agonists,
including chemokines. By RT-PCR on tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte lines
with degenerate primers based on sequences of known chemokine receptors,
Liao et al. (1997) isolated a cDNA encoding a GPCR, which they
designated STRL33. Using an expression cloning strategy with a T-cell
cDNA library, Deng et al. (1997) isolated an identical cDNA that they
named BONZO. The predicted 342-amino acid STRL33/BONZO protein shares 25
to 30% amino acid identity with other chemokine receptors and is most
similar to other GPCRs in the transmembrane domains. Northern blot
analysis detected a 2.1-kb transcript in spleen, thymus, small
intestine, and to a lesser extent in peripheral blood leukocytes,
prostate, and colon; a 2.6-kb transcript was detected in placenta (Deng
et al., 1997).

By expression cloning of mouse Cxcl16 (605398), Matloubian et al. (2000)
identified a protein with 71% amino acid identity to human BONZO, which
they renamed CXCR6.

GENE FUNCTION

Some chemokine receptors, notably CCR5 (601613) and CXCR4 (162643),
serve along with CD4 (186940) as coreceptors for human immunodeficiency
virus-1 (HIV-1; see 609423). CCR5-tropic HIV strains are primarily
involved in transmission, while strains with a broader tropism,
particularly for CXCR4, tend to emerge during the progression to
immunodeficiency. By fluorometric calcium flux analysis, Liao et al.
(1997) were unable to detect responses in STRL33-expressing cells to a
variety of chemokines. However, coexpression of CD4 and STRL33/BONZO
rendered cells able to fuse with macrophage-tropic HIV-1
(transmission-type) strains as well as with simian immunodeficiency
virus. Liao et al. (1997) but not Deng et al. (1997) also detected
fusion with T-cell-tropic HIV-1 strains. Liao et al. (1997) and Deng et
al. (1997) speculated that expression of STRL33/BONZO may substitute for
other HIV coreceptors, for example in CCR5 -/- individuals who become
infected with HIV.

Matloubian et al. (2000) found that human and mouse cells expressing
CXCR6 showed a strong chemotactic response to CXCL16 but not to other
chemokines. The authors concluded that CXCL16 and CXCR6 probably
function in interactions between dendritic cells and T cells and in
regulating T-cell migration in the splenic red pulp.

Using flow cytometric analysis of CD4 and CD8 (see 186910) T cells
expressing Th1- or Th2-type cytokines or expressing granzyme A (140050),
Kim et al. (2001) demonstrated that Th1 and Tc1, but not type-2, T cells
preferentially express CXCR6. Examination of inflamed liver and synovial
tissue showed enrichment of CXCR6-positive T cells, in accordance with
their lack of expression of lymphoid homing receptors (e.g., CCR7,
600242, and SELL, 153240) but frequent expression of extralymphoid
homing receptors (ITGA4 (192975)/ITGB7 (147559)) for gut and cutaneous
lymphocyte-associated antigen (CLA, see 600738). Stimulation of naive T
cells by allogeneic dendritic cells enhanced CXCR6 expression. CXCR6
expression was further upregulated in the presence of IL12 (see 161561),
but decreased in the presence of IL4 (147780). Kim et al. (2001)
concluded that CXCR6 may be important in the trafficking of effector T
cells mediating type-1 inflammation.

MAPPING

By Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA and somatic cell hybrid
analysis, Liao et al. (1997) mapped the single-copy STRL33 gene to
chromosome 3. They suggested that the STRL33 gene may be localized
within the cluster of chemokine receptor-encoding genes in 3p21.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Duggal et al. (2003) identified a SNP in the CXCR6 gene that was
associated with progression from Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) to
death in African Americans infected with HIV. The SNP, a G-to-A change
at nucleotide 1469, results in a nonconservative glu-to-lys change in
codon 3 of the receptor (E3K). Duggal et al. (2003) observed a frequency
of 44% for the 3K allele in a cohort of 805 African American intravenous
drug users seropositive for HIV. The allele frequency of 3K in
European-Americans was reported to be less than 1%. Although time to
AIDS and PCP was similar for all CXCR6 genotypes, HIV-infected
individuals homozygous for 3K had a significantly prolonged survival
time after the onset of PCP, but not after Candida albicans disease or
other AIDS-defining conditions, compared with individuals homozygous or
heterozygous for 3E. The 3K homozygous individuals were 5.6 times less
likely to die from a PCP-mediated AIDS-related death than were
individuals with a 3E allele.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ANKFY1 contains several protein-interacting domains and shares
significant identity with a number of S. cerevisiae proteins involved in
vesicular trafficking (Kuriyama et al., 2000).

CLONING

Ito et al. (1999) cloned mouse Ankfy1, which they designated Ankhzn. The
deduced 1,184-amino acid protein has an apparent molecular mass of 130
kD. Ankhzn contains an N-terminal coiled-coil domain, a BTB/POZ domain,
17 ankyrin repeats, and a C-terminal zinc finger motif. The ankyrin
repeats are separated into a group of 4 repeats in the N-terminal half
and a group of 13 repeats in the C-terminal half. Ito et al. (1999)
determined that there is a soluble form of Ankhzn and a form that
associates with endosomes.

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1999) cloned ANKFY1, which they designated
KIAA1255. The deduced protein shares 88% identity with mouse Ankhzn.
RT-PCR ELISA detected high expression in whole adult brain and
intermediate expression in all other tissues and specific brain regions
examined, including fetal brain.

By searching databases for sequences sharing homology with mouse Ankhzn,
followed by PCR, Kuriyama et al. (2000) cloned ANKHZN from a fetal brain
cDNA library. The deduced 1,166 amino acid protein has a calculated
molecular mass of about 128 kD. ANKHZN shares 85% identity with mouse
Ankhzn, and the 2 proteins have the same domain structure. Kuriyama et
al. (2000) noted that the C-terminal zinc finger (FYVE) domain, which
contains 8 potential Zn(2+)-coordinating cysteine residues that bind 2
Zn(2+) ions, is well conserved among proteins related to intracellular
trafficking. Northern blot analysis detected a 7-kb transcript in both
human and mouse brain. RT-PCR detected expression in all tissues
examined. Subcellular fractionation of human kidney recovered ANKHZN in
both the soluble and membrane fractions.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kuriyama et al. (2000) determined that the ANKFY1 gene contains 25
exons.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1999) mapped the ANKFY1
gene to chromosome 17. By radiation hybrid analysis and FISH, Kuriyama
et al. (2000) mapped the ANKFY1 gene to chromosome 17p13. Southern blot
analysis indicated that ANKFY1 is a single-copy gene.

118970	TITLE *118970 CLATHRIN, LIGHT POLYPEPTIDE B; CLTB
;;LCB
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Clathrin is the main structural component of the lattice covering the
cytoplasmic face of the coated pits and coated vesicles in which
specific macromolecules are entrapped in the process of
receptor-mediated endocytosis. Clathrin is a large, soluble protein
composed of heavy chains, which have molecular masses of about 192 kD,
and light chains, which have molecular masses of about 32 to 38 kD. Two
major classes of clathrin light chains, referred to as LCA (CLTA;
118960) and LCB (CTLB), have been identified (summary by Kirchhausen et
al., 1987). For additional information on clathrin, see 118960.

CLONING

Jackson et al. (1987) identified 4 distinct forms of bovine clathrin
light chains. This molecular variability derived from tissue-specific
splicing of Lca and Lcb genes.

Brodsky et al. (1987) identified that part of the light chain sequence
that mediates heavy chain binding and is the region of strongest
homology with intermediate filament proteins. Sequence analysis shows an
overall homology of 60% between LCA and LCB and the presence of
brain-specific insertion sequences.

Jackson and Parham (1988) compared cDNAs encoding the brain and nonbrain
forms of human LCA and LCB with their homologs in cow and rat. The
significant differences that distinguish LCA from LCB and the brain from
the nonbrain forms show remarkable preservation in all 3 species. Each
clathrin triskelion consists of 3 heavy chains and 3 light chains. In
the brain, tissue-specific mRNA splicing yields larger forms of LCA and
LCB, containing additional insertion sequences of 30 and 18 amino acids,
respectively.

MAPPING

By Southern blot analysis carried out on genomic DNA extracted from a
panel of mouse-human somatic cell hybrids and by isotopic in situ
hybridization, Ponnambalam et al. (1994) assigned the CLTB gene to human
chromosome 4q2-q3. However, Gross (2011) mapped the CLTB gene to
chromosome 5q35.2 based on an alignment of the CLTB sequence (GenBank
GENBANK BC006457) with the genomic sequence (GRCh37).

607294	TITLE *607294 TRANSFORMING GROWTH FACTOR-BETA-INDUCED FACTOR 2; TGIF2
;;TGFB-INDUCED FACTOR 2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Homeodomain transcription factors play fundamental roles in directing
cellular proliferation and differentiation and in determining cell
fates. TGIF2 is a member of a subfamily of transcription factors with an
atypical homeodomain called a TALE (3-amino acid loop extension) that
inserts 3 amino acids between helices 1 and 2 of the homeodomain.

CLONING

By searching an EST database using TGIF (602630) as the query, followed
by RT-PCR of an ovarian cancer cell line, Imoto et al. (2000) obtained a
full-length cDNA encoding TGIF2. The deduced 237-amino acid protein has
a calculated molecular mass of about 30 kD and contains a TALE sequence.
It also has a repression domain containing a proline-rich region that is
a putative SH3 domain-binding site and is thought to be involved in
transcriptional regulation. The homeodomain of TGIF2 is 77% identical to
the corresponding domain within TGIF, but outside this domain the
similarity is only 49%. Northern blot analysis revealed ubiquitous
expression of a single transcript, with highest levels in heart, kidney,
and testis, and lowest levels in brain and prostate. Transfection of
COS-7 cells with fluorescence-tagged TGIF2 revealed localization in the
cell nucleus but exclusion from nucleoli.

GENE FUNCTION

Imoto et al. (2000) noted that chromosome 20q, where the TGIF2 gene
maps, is often amplified in ovarian cancers. They screened 14 ovarian
cancer cell lines for amplification and expression of the TGIF2 gene and
detected overexpression in 5 cell lines. These lines also showed
amplification by FISH analysis, with the mean copy numbers ranging from
4 to 8. All cell lines with low levels of TGIF2 expression showed no
increase in relative copy numbers.

GENE STRUCTURE

Imoto et al. (2000) determined that the TGIF2 gene contains 3 exons and
spans about 18 kb.

MAPPING

By FISH, Imoto et al. (2000) mapped the TGIF2 gene to chromosome
20q11.2-q12.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Le Coniat et al. (1992) cloned a cDNA encoding a nuclear 43-kD
glycoprotein, identified as the G hnRNP protein. They designated the
gene HNRPG. The HNRPG cDNA has 60% homology with RBMY1A1.

Mazeyrat et al. (1999) isolated and sequenced 2 Rbmx mouse cDNA clones,
which they named Rbmx1 and Rbmx2, with distinct 3-prime ends. RT-PCR
showed that both Rbmx transcripts are ubiquitously expressed. Mazeyrat
et al. (1999) concluded that, based on the absence of intronic sequence,
the mouse Hnrpg gene is a retroposon derived from Rbmx.

GENE FUNCTION

The genes on the human Y chromosome fall into 2 classes with distinct
evolutionary origins. Widely expressed, single-copy genes with X
homologs that escape inactivation (X-Y shared genes) derive from the
ancient proto X-Y chromosome pair. Testis-specific, multicopy genes with
no X homologs originate from autosomes and have accumulated on a
'selfish Y' because of their male-specific function. Copies of genes in
the RBMY gene family (see RBMY1A1, 400006) are candidate spermatogenesis
genes because they are found in all 3 azoospermia factor (AZF) deletion
intervals on the human Yq, which are associated with oligospermia or
azoospermia (Vogt et al., 1997). An active X-borne homolog of the
Y-borne RBMY gene was demonstrated in humans and marsupials by Delbridge
et al. (1999) and in the mouse by Mazeyrat et al. (1999). Delbridge et
al. (1999) stated that, like other gene pairs on the X and Y chromosomes
(e.g., DFFRX/DFFRY; see 400005), RBMX retained a widespread function and
RBMY evolved a male-specific function in spermatogenesis. Thus, RBMY1A1,
far from belonging to a 'second class' of testis-specific elements, is a
diverged X-Y shared gene.

Venables et al. (2000) used a yeast 2-hybrid system to show that the
RBMY gene product hnRNPG and a novel testis-specific relative (termed
hnRNPG-T) interact with Tra2-beta (TRA2B; 602719), an activator of
pre-mRNA splicing that is ubiquitous but highly expressed in testis. The
RBMY gene product and Tra2-beta colocalized in 2 major domains in human
spermatocyte nuclei. Incubation with the protein interaction domain of
the RBMY gene product inhibited splicing in vitro of a specific pre-mRNA
substrate containing an essential enhancer bound by Tra2-beta. The
RNA-binding domain of RBM affected 5-prime splice site selection. The
authors concluded that the hnRNPG family of proteins is involved in
pre-mRNA splicing and hypothesized that RBM may be involved in
Tra2-beta-dependent splicing in spermatocytes.

Using in vivo splicing assays, Hofmann and Wirth (2002) identified
hnRNPG and its paralog RBM as splicing factors that promoted the
inclusion of SMN2 (601627) exon 7. Both hnRNPG and RBM nonspecifically
bound RNA, but directly and specifically bound Htra2-beta1, an SR-like
splicing factor which stimulates inclusion of exon 7 through a direct
interaction with SMN2 exon 7 pre-mRNA. Using deletion mutants of hnRNPG,
the authors demonstrated a specific protein-protein interaction of
hnRNPG with Htra2-beta1, which mediated the inclusion of SMN2 exon 7
rather than the nonspecific interaction of hnRNPG with SMN pre-mRNA.
These trans-acting splicing factors were also effective on endogenous
SMN2 transcripts and increased the endogenous SMN protein level. The
authors presented a model of how exon 7 mRNA processing may be regulated
by these splicing factors.

Nasim et al. (2003) showed that HNRNPG and the splicing activator
protein TRA2B have opposite effects upon the incorporation of several
exons, and that both are capable of acting as either an activator or a
repressor. HNRNPG acts via a specific sequence to repress the skeletal
muscle-specific exon (SK) of human slow skeletal alpha-tropomyosin
(TPM3; 191030), and stimulates inclusion of the alternative nonmuscle
exon. The binding of HNRNPG to the exon is antagonized by TRA2B. The 2
proteins also have opposite effects upon a dystrophin (300377)
pseudoexon. This exon was incorporated to a higher level in patient
heart muscle than skeletal muscle, causing X-linked dilated
cardiomyopathy. Cotransfection with HNRNPG repressed incorporation in
cardiac myoblasts, whereas TRA2B increased it in skeletal myoblasts. The
authors proposed that the HNRNPG/TRA2B ratio may contribute to cellular
splicing preferences, and that the higher proportion of HNRNPG in
skeletal muscle may play a role in preventing the incorporation of the
pseudoexon and thus in preventing skeletal muscle dystrophy.

MAPPING

Delbridge et al. (1999) mapped the RBMX gene to human Xq26 by FISH. By
PCR analysis of human/mouse hybrid cell lines, Mazeyrat et al. (1999)
demonstrated mapping of the HNRPG-homologous structural gene to the
human X chromosome. By FISH, they mapped the mouse Rbmx gene to XA3-XA5,
a region sharing homology of synteny with human Xq26. Mazeyrat et al.
(1999) localized the Hnrpg retroposon, which they renamed Rbmxrt, to
mouse chromosome 14.

- PSEUDOGENES

Le Coniat et al. (1992) had mapped the HNRPG gene to chromosome 6p12 by
radioactive in situ hybridization. Delbridge et al. (1999) found that
the HNRPG locus on 6p12 represents a processed pseudogene and considered
it likely that this and other intronless copies with nucleotide homology
to the HNRPG cDNA on chromosomes 1, 4, 9, 11, and the X chromosome were
derived by retrotransposition from RBMY-like sequence on the human X
chromosome. They suggested that the erroneous localization of the HNRPG
cDNA probably occurred because of the preferential hybridization of the
cDNA clone to the processed pseudogene on chromosome 6. Delbridge et al.
(1999) proposed that the HNRPG locus be renamed RBMXP1.

190700	TITLE *190700 ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 36, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF; ZFP36
;;TRISTETRAPROLIN; TTP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The mouse tristetraprolin protein (TTP) is a basic proline-rich protein
of molecular mass 33,600 Da that contains 3 PPPP repeats (Lai et al.,
1990). Its mRNA level increases dramatically after stimulation with
various mitogens. Also called ZFP36, Nup475 (DuBois et al., 1990), and
TISII or TIS11 (Varnum et al., 1991), it has been localized to the cell
nucleus and is thought to contain an unusual zinc finger structure
(DuBois et al., 1990). Taylor et al. (1991) reported the sequence of
human TTP, which is 87% identical to the mouse protein; the putative
zinc finger structure is conserved among human, mouse and rat.

AU-rich elements (AREs) in the 3-prime untranslated regions (UTRs) of
unstable mRNAs dictate their degradation. Using an RNA
interference-based screen in Drosophila S2 cells, Jing et al. (2005)
found that Dicer-1 (606241), Argonaute-1 (AGO1, or EIF2C1; 606228), and
Ago2 (EIF2C2; 606229), components involved in microRNA (miRNA)
processing and function, were required for rapid decay of mRNA
containing AREs of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF; 191160). The
requirement for Dicer in the instability of ARE-containing mRNA
(ARE-RNA) was confirmed in HeLa cells.

TTP destabilizes TNF-alpha mRNA after binding directly to the ARE of the
3-prime UTR of the TNA-alpha mRNA. Lai et al. (2000) showed that
C-terminal truncated forms of TTP, as well as a 77-amino acid fragment
that contains both zinc fingers, could bind to the TNF-alpha ARE in
cell-free crosslinking and gel shift assays. In addition, the truncated
forms of TTP could stimulate the deadenylation and/or breakdown of
TNF-alpha mRNA in intact cells.

Jing et al. (2005) showed that miR16 (MIRN16-1; 609704), a human miRNA
containing an UAAAUAUU sequence that is complementary to the ARE
sequence, was required for ARE-RNA turnover. The role of miR16 in
ARE-RNA decay was sequence-specific and required the ARE-binding protein
TTP. TTP did not directly bind miR16, but interacted through association
with Ago/EIF2C family members to complex with miR16 and assist in the
targeting of ARE. Jing et al. (2005) concluded that miRNA targeting of
ARE appears to be an essential step in ARE-mediated mRNA degradation.

GENE FUNCTION

Belloc and Mendez (2008) reported genomewide functional screening to
identify previously unknown mRNAs cytoplasmically polyadenylated at
meiotic phase transitions. A significant fraction of transcripts
containing, in addition to cytoplasmic polyadenylation elements (CPEs),
ARE sequences were identified. Among these is the mRNA encoding C3H-4,
whose human homolog is ZFP36, an ARE-binding protein that Belloc and
Mendez (2008) found to accumulate in meiosis 1 and the ablation of which
induced meiotic arrest. Belloc and Mendez (2008) concluded that C3H-4
recruits the CCR4 (604836) deadenylase complex to ARE-containing mRNAs
and that this, in turn, causes shortening of poly(A) tails. They also
showed that the opposing activities of the CPEs and the AREs define the
precise activation times of the mRNAs encoding the anaphase-promoting
complex inhibitors Emi1 (606013) and Emi2 (609110) during distinct
phases of the meiotic cycle. Belloc and Mendez (2008) concluded that an
'early' wave of cytoplasmic polyadenylation activates a negative
feedback loop by activating the synthesis of C3H-4, which in turn would
recruit the deadenylase complex to mRNAs containing both CPEs and AREs.
This negative feedback loop is required to exit from metaphase into
interkinesis and for meiotic progression.

MAPPING

By study of panels of rodent/human hybrid cell lines, Taylor et al.
(1991) mapped the human TTP gene to chromosome 19. The mouse gene was
localized to chromosome 7, using an interspecific cross. The linkage
data suggested that it lies approximately 6 cM from the proximal end of
mouse chromosome 7 in a region homologous with 19q13.1 in the human.
This localization was confirmed by in situ hybridization of the human
cDNA probe to metaphase chromosome spreads. Hoovers et al. (1992) also
assigned zinc finger protein genes to both 19p and 19qter and commented
on the fact that a number of finger protein genes occur in linked
clusters. This mapping was part of an identification and partial
characterization of 101 potential human zinc finger protein genes which
were isolated with an oligonucleotide specific for the sequence that
frequently links contiguous zinc fingers. See Huebner et al. (1993) for
the assignment of other zinc finger protein genes to 19q.

ANIMAL MODEL

TNF-alpha is a major mediator of both acute and chronic inflammatory
responses in many diseases. In addition to its well-known role in acute
septic shock, it has been implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic
processes such as autoimmunity, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD; see
614395), rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn disease, and the cachexia
accompanying cancer and AIDS. Treatments such as neutralizing antibodies
to TNF-alpha and chimeric soluble TNF-alpha receptors have demonstrated
efficacy against some of these conditions in clinical trials (Lorenz et
al., 1996; Abraham et al., 1997). Carballo et al. (1998) developed mice
deficient in Ttp. Although the Ttp-deficient mice appeared normal at
birth, they soon developed a complex syndrome of inflammatory arthritis,
dermatitis, cachexia, autoimmunity, and myeloid hyperplasia. Essentially
all aspects of this syndrome could be prevented by repeated injections
of antibodies to TNF-alpha. Macrophages derived from the liver of
Ttp-deficient fetuses, or from bone marrow precursors or resident
peritoneal macrophages from adult mice, exhibited increased production
of TNF-alpha, as well as increased amounts of TNF-alpha mRNA, after
stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Carballo et al. (1998)
demonstrated direct Ttp binding to the AU-rich element of the TNF-alpha
mRNA. TTP is a cytosolic protein in these cells, and its biosynthesis
was induced by the same agents that stimulate TNF-alpha production,
including TNF-alpha itself. These findings identified TTP as a component
of a negative feedback loop that interferes with TNF-alpha production by
destabilizing its mRNA. This pathway represents a potential target for
anti-TNF-alpha therapies.

As indicated, deficiency of TTP results in a complex inflammatory
syndrome in mice. Most aspects of the syndrome are secondary to excess
circulating tumor necrosis factor, a consequence of increased stability
of TNF-alpha mRNA in Ttp-deficient macrophages. TTP can bind directly to
the AU-rich element in TNF-alpha mRNA, increasing its lability. Carballo
et al. (2000) showed that Ttp deficiency also results in increased
cellular production of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor
(CFS2; 138960) and increased stability of its mRNA, apparently secondary
to decreased deadenylation. Similar findings were observed in mice also
lacking both types of TNF-alpha receptors, excluding excess TNF-alpha
production as a cause of the increased CSF2 mRNA levels and stability.
TTP appears to be a physiologic regulator of CSF2 mRNA deadenylation and
stability.

610594	TITLE *610594 FOLLICULIN-INTERACTING PROTEIN 1; FNIP1
;;KIAA1961
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By randomly sequencing clones derived from an adult brain cDNA library,
Nagase et al. (2001) cloned FNIP1, which they designated KIAA1961.
RT-PCR ELISA detected ubiquitous expression in all human adult and fetal
tissues and specific brain regions examined, with highest expression in
spleen, testis, ovary, and adult and fetal liver.

Using coimmunoprecipitation with HA-tagged folliculin (FLCN; 607273)
expressed in HEK293 cells to identify FLCN-interacting proteins,
followed by mass spectrometry and database analysis, and PCR of a pooled
human tissue cDNA library, Baba et al. (2006) isolated full-length
FNIP1. The deduced 1,166-amino acid protein has no known functional
domains. Expression of FNIP1 in HEK293 cells yielded a protein that
migrated at 130 kD on SDS-PAGE. Northern blot analysis detected
strongest expression in heart, liver, and placenta with moderate
expression in kidney and lung.

Using quantitative real-time PCR, Hasumi et al. (2008) detected variable
FNIP1 expression in most human tissues. Highest expression was in
salivary gland, nasal mucosa, parathyroid gland, and muscle.

GENE FUNCTION

Using coimmunoprecipitation of FNIP1 and FLCN expressed in HEK293 cells
and in vitro binding assays, Baba et al. (2006) showed that the C
terminus of FLCN and amino acids 300 to 1166 of FNIP1 were required for
optimal FLCN-FNIP1 binding. FLCN and FNIP1 colocalized to the cytoplasm
in a reticular pattern. FNIP1 interacted with HSP90 (HSPCA; 140571) and
with the alpha (PRKAA1; 602739), beta (PRKAB1; 602740), and gamma
(PRKAG1; 602742) subunits of AMPK. FNIP1 was phosphorylated by AMPK, and
its phosphorylation was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by an AMPK
inhibitor, resulting in reduced FNIP1 expression. FLCN phosphorylation
was diminished by rapamycin and amino acid starvation and facilitated by
FNIP1 overexpression, suggesting that FLCN phosphorylation may be
regulated by mTOR (FRAP1; 601231) and AMPK signaling. Baba et al. (2006)
concluded that FLCN and FNIP1 may be involved in energy and/or nutrient
sensing through the AMPK and mTOR signaling pathways.

Using coimmunoprecipitation analysis with HEK293 cells, Hasumi et al.
(2008) detected FNIP2 (612768) in protein complexes with FNIP1, FLCN,
and AMPK. FNIP1 and FNIP2 formed homo- and heterodimers.

Takagi et al. (2008) found that, when expressed alone, FLCN localized to
the nucleus, but when coexpressed with FNIP1 or FNIP2, the coexpressed
proteins localized to the cytoplasm in a reticular pattern.
Downregulation of FLCN, FNIP1, or FNIP2 via small interfering RNA
resulted in decreased S6K1 (RPS6KB1; 608938) phosphorylation, suggesting
that the FLCN complex regulates S6K1 phosphorylation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Baba et al. (2006) determined that the FNIP1 gene contains 18 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Nagase et al. (2001) mapped the FNIP1 gene
to chromosome 5.

;;C/EBP-HOMOLOGOUS PROTEIN; CHOP;;
GROWTH ARREST- AND DNA DAMAGE-INDUCIBLE GENE GADD153; GADD153
CHOP/FUS FUSION GENE, INCLUDED;;
CHOP/EWS FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Ron and Habener (1992) cloned mouse Ddit3, which they called Chop.
Antisera raised against Chop recognized a nuclear protein with a
molecular mass of 29 kD.

Park et al. (1992) isolated the DDIT3 gene, which they called GADD153,
from human cells. The DDIT3 gene shows a high level of conservation in
both the structural and regulatory regions to the previously described
hamster gene. The human and hamster proteins share 91% amino acid
identity.

GENE FUNCTION

Ron and Habener (1992) showed that CHOP serves as a dominant-negative
inhibitor of the transcription factors C/EBP (116897, 116898) and LAP
(189965). They found that bacterially expressed CHOP inhibited the
DNA-binding activity of C/EBP and LAP by forming heterodimers that could
not bind DNA.

Using differential expression and immunohistochemical analyses of benign
nevi and melanomas of different levels, Korabiowska et al. (1997)
observed p53 (TP53; 191170) negativity and high expression of GADD34
(PPP1R15A; 611048), GADD45 (GADD45A; 126335), and GADD153 in all nevi.
However, in melanomas, p53 expression increased and GADD expression
decreased with the Clark level of melanoma thickness. Patient survival
time correlated negatively with p53 positivity and positively with
GADD45 and GADD153 expression. Korabiowska et al. (1997) concluded that
GADD proteins play an important role in the malignant transformation of
nevus to melanoma.

CHOP is activated by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress imposed by
unfolded and malfolded proteins. By transcriptional profiling, Marciniak
et al. (2004) compared gene expression in unstressed and ER-stressed
wildtype and Chop -/- primary mouse embryo fibroblasts. They found that
Chop directly activated Gadd34, which promoted ER protein biosynthesis
by dephosphorylating Eif2-alpha (EIF2S1; 603907) in stressed cells,
causing accumulation of high molecular mass protein complexes in the
stressed ER. Chop also activated Ero1-alpha (ERO1L; 615435), which
encodes an ER oxidase. Consequently, the ER of stressed Chop -/- cells
was hypooxidized relative to the ER of stressed wildtype cells.
Pharmacologic and genetic manipulations promoting a hypooxidized ER
reduced abnormal high molecular mass protein complexes and protected
cells from the lethal consequences of ER stress. Marciniak et al. (2004)
concluded that Chop deletion protected cells from ER stress by
decreasing ER protein load and changing redox conditions.

GENE STRUCTURE

Park et al. (1992) determined that the human and hamster DDIT3 genes
both contain 4 exons, with the intron/exon junctions maintained at
identical positions.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid analysis and in situ hybridization, Park et al.
(1992) mapped the DDIT3 gene to chromosome 12q13.1-q13.2.

CYTOGENETICS

CHOP is consistently rearranged in myxoid liposarcomas (613488) (Aman et
al., 1992). In the characteristic chromosomal translocation
t(12;16)(q13;p11), Crozat et al. (1993) showed that the CHOP gene is
fused with a gene on chromosome 16 provisionally designated TLS
(translocated in liposarcoma). The same gene was called FUS by Rabbitts
et al. (1993); see 137070. The TLS gene was found to be a novel nuclear
RNA-binding protein with extensive sequence similarity to EWS (133450),
the product of a gene commonly translocated in Ewing sarcoma (612219).
In TLS-CHOP, the RNA-binding domain of TLS is replaced by the
DNA-binding and leucine zipper dimerization domain of CHOP. Targeting of
a conserved effector domain of RNA-binding proteins to DNA may play a
role in tumor formation.

In an analysis of peripheral blood samples from 19 patients with myxoid
liposarcoma due to t(12;16) and in 1 patient with myxoid liposarcoma due
to t(12;22;20), resulting in the fusion of the CHOP and EWS genes,
Panagopoulos et al. (1996) found FUS/CHOP hybrid fragments in 3 patients
with t(12;16) and a EWS/CHOP hybrid in the patient with the latter
translocation.

ANIMAL MODEL

Endo et al. (2006) found that mice challenged intratracheally with
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) expressed Chop and Bip (HSPA5; 138120).
Compared with wildtype mice, mice lacking Chop showed reduced lung
inflammation in response to LPS, diminished Il1b (147720) activity, and
suppression of Casp11 (SFRS2IP; 603668) induction in bronchoalveolar
lavage fluid. Inflammation of lung in response to Il1b was not
attenuated in Chop-deficient mice. Endo et al. (2006) concluded that
CHOP is critical in LPS-induced lung injury and in induction of CASP11,
which mediates activation of pro-CASP1 (147678) and pro-IL1B.

176871	TITLE *176871 EUKARYOTIC TRANSLATION INITIATION FACTOR 2-ALPHA KINASE 2; EIF2AK2
;;PROTEIN KINASE, INTERFERON-INDUCIBLE DOUBLE-STRANDED RNA-ACTIVATED;
PRKR;;
PKR;;
p68 KINASE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

EIF2AK2 is a protein serine/threonine kinase that acquires enzymatic
activity following autophosphorylation, a process mediated by
double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Activation of EIF2AK2 allows the kinase to
phosphorylate its natural substrate, the alpha subunit of eukaryotic
protein synthesis initiation factor-2 (EIF2-alpha; 603907), leading to
the inhibition of protein synthesis (summary by Kuhen et al., 1996).

CLONING

Meurs et al. (1990) cloned EIF2AK2, which encodes a 550-amino acid
protein with a predicted molecular mass of 62 kD. Immunoblot assay of
interferon-treated human Daudi and murine L929 cells identified a 68-kD
protein in human cells and a 65-kD protein in mouse cells. Transcription
of EIF2AK2 was induced following exposure to interferon (IFNG; 147570)
in a dose-dependent manner and was not affected by inhibition of protein
synthesis.

Kuhen et al. (1996) isolated the EIF2AK2 gene, which they called PKR, as
lambda phage and P1 phage clones from a human genomic library, and
compared the structural organization of the mouse and human genes. The
human and mouse proteins shared approximately 60% amino acid identity.
Kuhen et al. (1996) determined the nucleotide sequence of the human
EIF2AK2 gene, which encodes a 551-amino acid protein.

Jeon et al. (2012) reported that PKR contains 2 N-terminal dsRNA-
binding motifs and a long C-terminal kinase domain.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kuhen et al. (1996) determined that the EIF2AK2 gene contains 17 exons
and spans approximately 50 kb.

MAPPING

Barber et al. (1993) mapped the EIF2AK2 gene to chromosome 2p21 by in
situ hybridization. The corresponding mouse gene was mapped to
chromosome 17 (band E2) by the same method. By FISH analysis, Squire et
al. (1993) assigned the EIF2AK2 gene to the boundary between chromosome
2p22-p21.

GENE FUNCTION

Ben-Asouli et al. (2002) showed that human gamma-interferon mRNA uses
local activation of PKR in the cell to control its own translation
yield. IFNG mRNA was found to activate PKR through a pseudoknot in its
5-prime untranslated region. Mutations that impaired pseudoknot
stability reduced the ability to activate PKR and strongly increased the
translation efficiency of IFNG mRNA. Nonphosphorylatable mutant
eIF2-alpha (eIF2A; 609234), knockout of PKR, and the PKR inhibitors
2-aminopurine, transdominant-negative PKR, or vaccinia E3L
correspondingly enhanced translation of IFNG mRNA. The potential to form
the pseudoknot was found to be phylogenetically conserved. Ben-Asouli et
al. (2002) proposed that the RNA pseudoknot acts to adjust translation
of IFNG mRNA to the PKR level expressed in the cell.

Taylor et al. (1999) studied the mechanism underlying the resistance of
hepatitis C virus (HCV) to interferon. They demonstrated that the HCV
envelope protein E2 contains a sequence identical with phosphorylation
sites of the interferon-inducible protein kinase PKR and the translation
initiation factor EIF2-alpha, a target of PKR. E2 inhibited the kinase
activity of PKR and blocked its inhibitory effect on protein synthesis
and cell growth. This interaction of E2 in PKR may be one mechanism by
which HCV circumvents the antiviral effect of interferon. Taylor et al.
(1999) hypothesized that another potential outcome of PKR inhibition is
the promotion of cell growth which may contribute to HCV-associated
hepatocellular carcinoma.

Huntington disease (143100) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a
trinucleotide repeat expansion within the huntingtin gene (613004),
resulting in generation of a polyglutamine tract in the protein product.
Peel et al. (2001) showed that PKR preferentially bound mutant
huntingtin RNA transcripts immobilized on streptavidin columns that had
been incubated with human brain extracts. Immunohistochemical studies
demonstrated that PKR was present in its activated form in both human
Huntington autopsy material and brain tissue derived from Huntington
yeast artificial chromosome transgenic mice. The increased
immunolocalization of the activated kinase was more pronounced in areas
most affected by the disease. The authors suggested a role for PKR
activation in the Huntington disease process.

Gale et al. (1998) showed that P58(IPK) (601184) is inhibited through a
direct interaction with P52(rIPK) (607374), which in turn results in
upregulation of PKR activity. Gale et al. (1998) concluded that their
data described a protein kinase-regulatory system that encompasses an
intersection of interferon-, stress-, and growth-regulatory pathways.

PKR, which is involved in TLR signaling and mediates apoptosis in
fibroblasts in response to viral infection and inflammatory cytokines,
also activates IKK (see 600664) and NFKB (see 164011), thereby
suppressing apoptosis. To determine the role of PKR in macrophage
apoptosis, Hsu et al. (2004) examined its regulation and found that both
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and poly(IC) activate PKR dependent on the
presence of TRIF (607601). Macrophages lacking PKR had normal activation
of p38 (MAPK14; 600289) and IKK as well as other NFKB target genes in
response to LPS, but exhibited defective STAT1 (600555) phosphorylation
and failed to undergo apoptosis, independent of the presence of IFNB
(147640). They observed that apoptosis induced by live pathogenic
gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria required both TLR4 (603030) and
PKR, possibly representing a major mechanism for pathogenic bacteria
that use specific virulence factors to avoid detection and destruction
by the innate immune system. Hsu et al. (2004) proposed that TLR4
activates PKR and triggers apoptosis through TRIF and TRAM (608321)
adaptor proteins and that inhibition of PKR may augment
macrophage-mediated antibacterial responses.

Zhang et al. (2004) used immunoprecipitation and reconstituted kinase
assays to show that the FANCC (227645), FANCA (607139), and FANCG
(602956) proteins functionally interacted with and inhibited PKR in bone
marrow cells. PKR showed strongest binding to the FANCC protein. PKR
activity was increased in bone marrow cells of patients with Fanconi
anemia (FA; 227650) with mutations in the FANCC, FANCA, or FANCG genes.
All 3 of these cell lines showed significant increases in PKR bound to
the FANCC protein, which correlated with increased PKR activation. The
cells also showed hypersensitivity to growth repression mediated by
IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha (191160). Forced expression of a patient-derived
FANCC mutation increased PKR activation and cell death. Zhang et al.
(2004) concluded that FA mutations cause increased binding of PKR to
FANCC and increased PKR activation, leading to growth inhibition of
hematopoietic progenitors and bone marrow failure in Fanconi anemia.

Nallagatla et al. (2007) reported that RNAs with very limited secondary
structures activate PKR in a 5-prime-triphosphate-dependent fashion in
vitro and in vivo. Activation of PKR by 5-prime-triphosphate RNA is
independent of RIG1 (ROBO3; 608630) and is enhanced by treatment with
type I interferon (IFNA; 147660). Surveillance of molecular features at
the 5-prime end of transcripts by PKR presents a means of allowing
pathogenic RNA to be distinguished from self-RNA. Nallagatla et al.
(2007) concluded that this form of RNA-based discrimination may be a
critical step in mounting an early immune response.

To be effective, PKR must recognize a conserved substrate (eIF2A;
609234) while avoiding rapidly evolving substrate mimics such as the
poxvirus-encoded K3L. Using the PKR-K3L system and a combination of
phylogenetic and functional analyses, Elde et al. (2009) uncovered
evolutionary strategies by which host proteins can overcome viral
mimicry. Elde et al. (2009) found that PKR has evolved under intense
episodes of positive selection in primates. The ability of PKR to evade
viral mimics is partly due to positive selection at sites most
intimately involved in eIF2A recognition. They also found that adaptive
changes on multiple surfaces of PKR produce combinations of
substitutions that increase the odds of defeating mimicry. Elde et al.
(2009) concluded that, although it can seem that pathogens gain
insurmountable advantages by mimicking cellular components, host factors
such as PKR can compete in molecular 'arms races' with mimics because of
evolutionary flexibility at protein interaction interfaces challenged by
mimicry.

Using HCT116 human colon carcinoma cells and mouse embryo fibroblasts,
Yoon et al. (2009) found PKR mRNA and protein were upregulated by p53
(TP53; 191170) and by genotoxic stress, which induces p53 expression.
Deletion analysis and DNase footprinting revealed 2 half-sites for p53
binding within the PKR promoter. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays,
chromatin immunoprecipitation, and reporter gene assays revealed direct
p53 binding to these sites, with activation of the PKR promoter. Binding
and activation of PKR by p53 was independent of interferon binding. In
response to genotoxic stress, cytoplasmic PKR was largely phosphorylated
and was associated with the phosphorylation and activation of
EIF2-alpha. Knockdown of either p53 or PKR abrogated all cellular
effects of genotoxic stress. PKR also played a role in p53-mediated
inhibition of translation, G2 arrest, and apoptosis following DNA
damage. Furthermore, knockdown of PKR in HCT116 cells and derived tumors
provided resistance to anticancer agents. Yoon et al. (2009) concluded
that PKR has a role in p53-mediated cellular responses to genotoxic
stress.

By studying HMGB1 (163905) release mechanisms, Lu et al. (2012)
identified a role for PKR in inflammasome activation. Exposure of
macrophages to inflammasome agonists induced PKR autophosphorylation.
PKR inactivation by genetic deletion or pharmacologic inhibition
severely impaired inflammasome activation in response to double-stranded
RNA, ATP, monosodium urate, adjuvant aluminum, rotenone, live E. coli,
anthrax lethal toxin, DNA transfection, and S. typhimurium infection.
PKR deficiency significantly inhibited the secretion of IL1-beta
(147720), IL18 (600953), and HMGB1 in E. coli-induced peritonitis. PKR
physically interacts with several inflammasome components, including
NLRP3 (606416), NLRP1 (606636), NLRC4 (606831), and AIM2 (604578), and
broadly regulates inflammasome activation. PKR autophosphorylation in a
cell-free system with recombinant NLRP3, ASC (PYCARD; 606838), and
pro-caspase-1 (147678) reconstituted inflammasome activity. Lu et al.
(2012) concluded that their results showed a crucial role for PKR in
inflammasome activation, and indicated that it should be possible to
pharmacologically target this molecule to treat inflammation.

Lee et al. (2011) found that the long noncoding RNA VTRNA2-1 (614938),
which they called pre-MIR886, directly bound to PKR in human cell lines
and inhibited its autoactivation. VTRNA2-1 was downregulated and PKR was
activated in a significant number of diverse cancer cell lines.
Knockdown of VTRNA2-1 resulted in PKR activation and PKR-dependent
phosphorylation of EIF2-alpha. PKR activation also independently induced
the NF-kappa-B pathway.

Kunkeaw et al. (2012) confirmed that VTRNA2-1, which they called NC886,
was a direct inhibitor of PKR. Knockdown of NC886 in nontransformed
cholangiocyte cells consistently activated the canonical PKR-EIF2-alpha
cell death pathway. However, in cholangiocarcinoma cells that either
lacked endogenous NC886 expression or in which NC886 expression was
knocked down, PKR activation frequently induced the NF-kappa-B cell
survival pathway. Kunkeaw et al. (2012) concluded that the effects of
NC886 downregulation or PKR activation depend on cellular context.

Jeon et al. (2012) found that a central region of NC886 stably
interacted with the 2 N-terminal dsRNA-binding motifs of PKR, with much
weaker binding to each motif individually. PKR bound preferentially to
NC886 in its slow-migrating conformation when the PKR-binding sequence
was single-stranded and sensitive to RNase digestion, but not when it
assumed a 4-nucleotide duplex structure. NC886 reciprocally competed
with double-stranded poly(I:C) for PKR binding. Because NC886 does not
show an extensive duplex region, Jeon et al. (2012) predicted that NC886
and dsRNAs bind PKR via different mechanisms. They hypothesized that
NC886 provides a threshold for PKR activation so that it occurs during
genuine viral infection and not in response to basal levels of cellular
dsRNA.

;;GRB2-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN; GASP;;
SIGNALING PHOSPHOPROTEIN SPECIFIC FOR T CELLS; SPOT;;
CHROMOSOME 6 OPEN READING FRAME 190; C6ORF190
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

THEMIS is critical to the transition of CD4 (186940)-positive/CD8 (see
186910)-positive double-positive (DP) thymocytes to major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-restricted
CD4-negative/CD8-positive or MHC class II-restricted
CD4-positive/CD8-negative single-positive (SP) thymocytes (Kakugawa et
al., 2009).

CLONING

Using subtractive hybridization to identify genes differentially
expressed in mouse T-cell receptor-alpha (TCRA; see 186880) -/- thymus
versus Rag1 (179615) -/- thymus, followed by database analysis and
screening a human Jurkat T-cell cDNA library, Fu et al. (2009) cloned
mouse and human THEMIS. The predicted 641-amino acid human protein
shares 81% identity with mouse Themis. Both human and mouse THEMIS
contain a putative bipartite nuclear localization signal and a highly
conserved C-terminal proline-rich region predicted to form 3 overlapping
SH3 domain recognition motifs. RNA blot analysis revealed that mouse
Themis was expressed in thymus and, to a lesser extent, in spleen, but
not in nonlymphoid tissues. Within thymus, expression was low in
double-negative stage-1 (DN1) and DN2, but it was upregulated in DN3 and
early DP thymocytes. Themis expression was downregulated again in mature
SP thymocytes. In situ hybridization analysis showed Themis expression
primarily in cortical rather than medullary thymocytes.

Using N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) mutagenesis screening in mice,
followed by database analysis, Johnson et al. (2009) identified mouse
and human THEMIS. They found that THEMIS contains an N-terminal tandem
repeat of a unique conserved globular domain, which they called CABIT
(cysteine-containing all-beta in THEMIS). The CABIT domain was predicted
to adopt an all beta-strand structure, and it contains a conserved
cysteine. Immunoblot analysis showed expression of a 73-kD protein in
mouse thymus, lymph node, and spleen, but not in nonlymphoid tissues.
Confocal microscopy revealed cytoplasmic localization of mouse Themis in
transfected human and mouse cells.

Using subtractive cDNA hybridization to identify mouse genes important
for T-cell development, followed by screening mouse fetal thymus and
human Jurkat cell cDNA libraries, Lesourne et al. (2009) cloned mouse
and human THEMIS. They detected Themis in both the nucleus and cytoplasm
of mouse thymocytes.

GENE FUNCTION

By immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analyses, Fu et al. (2009) showed
that THEMIS was phosphorylated quickly after TCR stimulation in mouse
and human cells. Using mouse Themis -/- thymocytes, they found that
Themis was required for optimal TCR-driven calcium mobilization and Erk
(see 601795) activation.

Johnson et al. (2009) showed that mouse Themis associated with GRB2
(108355) by coimmunoprecipitation analysis of transfected HEK293 and
Jurkat cells. Using an SH3 domain array screen and coimmunoprecipitation
analysis, Lesourne et al. (2009) independently showed that mouse Themis
bound Grb2.

By mutation analysis, Patrick et al. (2009) showed that human THEMIS,
which they called GASP, associated with the N-terminal SH3 domain of
GRB2. The C-terminal proline-rich region of GASP was not required for
association with GRB2.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Fu et al. (2009) mapped the THEMIS gene to
chromosome 6q22.33. They mapped the mouse gene to chromosome 10A4.

ANIMAL MODEL

Fu et al. (2009) generated Themis -/- mice, which were viable, born at
the expected mendelian frequency, and showed no gross abnormalities.
Themis -/- thymocytes exhibited defective positive selection, resulting
in fewer mature thymocytes, which were primarily Cd4-positive/Cd25
(IL2RA; 147730)-positive/Foxp3 (300292)-positive regulatory and Cd62l
(SELL; 153240)-low/Cd44 (107269)-high memory cells. Negative selection
was also impaired in Themis -/- mice.

Using ENU mutagenesis, Johnson et al. (2009) obtained mice with a
tyr489-to-ter (Y489X) mutation in the second CABIT domain of Themis. The
mutation crippled differentiation of DP T cells in SP cells. Mutant
thymocytes showed no substantial impairment in early TCR signaling, but
genes involved in cell cycling and survival had altered expression
before and during positive selection. Johnson et al. (2009) concluded
that THEMIS has a function in sustaining positive selection.

Lesourne et al. (2009) found that thymocyte selection was impaired and
the numbers of Cd4-positive/Cd8-intermediate thymocytes and Cd4-positive
or Cd8-positive SP thymocytes were lower in Themis -/- mice. Themis -/-
Cd4-positive/Cd8-intermediate thymocytes showed developmental defects
consistent with attenuated signaling that were reversible by TCR
stimulation. Lesourne et al. (2009) concluded that THEMIS is a critical
component of the T-cell development program, possibly functioning to
sustain and/or integrate signal required for proper lineage commitment
and maturation.

Patrick et al. (2009) showed that differentiation of Cd4 and Cd8 SP
cells in the thymus was severely inhibited in Themis -/- mice. No other
TCR-induced events were affected by Themis deficiency.

Using ENU mutagenesis and substitution of Themis exon 1 with green
fluorescent protein in mice, Kakugawa et al. (2009) independently showed
that Themis was essential for development of SP thymocytes.

601982	TITLE *601982 8-@OXOGUANINE DNA GLYCOSYLASE; OGG1
;;8-@HYDROXYGUANINE DNA GLYCOSYLASE
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The major mutagenic base lesion in DNA caused by exposure to reactive
oxygen species is 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG). This damaged base is excised by
a DNA glycosylase with an associated lyase activity for chain cleavage.
Lu et al. (1997), Aburatani et al. (1997), Bjoras et al. (1997),
Rosenquist et al. (1997), Radicella et al. (1997), and Roldan-Arjona et
al. (1997) cloned human cDNAs with partial sequence homology to the
yeast 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (OGG1) gene. Radicella et al. (1997)
found that the predicted protein has 345 amino acids and a calculated
molecular mass of 39 kD. Roldan-Arjona et al. (1997), who called the
enzyme 8-hydroxyguanine DNA glycosylase, estimated their 424-amino acid
predicted human enzyme to have a size of 47 kD. They showed that it
releases free 8-hydroxyguanine from oxidized DNA and introduces a chain
break in a double-stranded oligonucleotide specifically at an
8-hydroxyguanine residue base-paired with cytosine. Expression of the
human protein in a DNA repair-deficient E. coli strain partly suppressed
its spontaneous mutator phenotype. Radicella et al. (1997) showed that
when the human coding sequence was expressed in a yeast strain mutant in
Ogg1, it was able to complement the spontaneous mutator phenotype. Arai
et al. (1997) also cloned the human OGG1 gene and, by Northern blotting,
showed that the gene is ubiquitously expressed in a variety of human
organs.

Rosenquist et al. (1997) cloned both the human and mouse OGG1 genes.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Roldan-Arjona et al. (1997) and
Radicella et al. (1997) mapped the human OGG1 gene to 3p25
(3p25.3-p25.2). By the same method, Arai et al. (1997) mapped the OGG1
gene to 3p26.2. By radiation hybrid analysis, Ishida et al. (1999)
mapped the gene to 3p26, proximal to the VHL gene (608537).

GENE FUNCTION

Rosenquist et al. (1997) showed that the mouse ogg1 gene product acts
efficiently on DNA duplexes in which 8-oxodeoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) is
paired with dC, acts weakly on duplexes in which 8-oxodG is paired with
dT or dG, and is inactive against duplexes in which 8-oxodG is paired
with dA. The human, mouse, and yeast OGG1 genes contain the
helix-hairpin-helix motif characteristic of a family of DNA glycosylases
(Rosenquist et al., 1997; Arai et al., 1997).

By confocal laser microscopy, Bjoras et al. (1997) showed that OGG1 is
localized in the nucleus.

By Northern blot analysis, Kuo and Sklar (1997) found that OGG1 is
expressed as 2.0- and 1.8-kb transcripts predominantly in germinal
center B cells and tonsil and to a lesser extent in other lymphoid
cells. In situ hybridization analysis indicated that OGG1 is most
abundantly expressed in the dark zones of germinal centers. The function
and localization of OGG1 suggest that it may play a role in somatic
hypermutation of immunoglobulin genes.

Kohno et al. (1998) demonstrated that multiple isoforms of the OGG1
protein are produced in human lung cells as a result of genetic
polymorphisms and alternative splicing of the OGG1 gene. They also found
frequent loss of heterozygosity at the OGG1 locus in primary lung tumors
and an intragenic mutation of the OGG1 gene in a lung cancer cell line.

Perillo et al. (2008) analyzed how H3 histone methylation and
demethylation control expression of estrogen-responsive genes and showed
that a DNA-bound estrogen receptor (see ESRA, 133430) directs
transcription by participating in bending chromatin to contact the RNA
polymerase II (see 180660) recruited to the promoter. This process is
driven by receptor-targeted demethylation of H3K9 (see 602810) at both
enhancer and promoter sites and is achieved by activation of resident
LSD1 (609132) demethylase. Localized demethylation produces hydrogen
peroxide, which modifies the surrounding DNA and recruits
8-oxoguanine-DNA glycosylase 1 and topoisomerase II-beta (126431),
triggering chromatin and DNA conformational changes that are essential
for estrogen-induced transcription. Perillo et al. (2008) concluded that
their data showed a strategy that uses controlled DNA damage and repair
to guide productive transcription.

GENE STRUCTURE

Tani et al. (1998) analyzed the genomic structure of the mouse Ogg1 gene
and showed that it maps to chromosome 6. It consists of 7 exons
approximately 6 kb long, and 2 DNA-binding motifs are encoded in exons 4
through 5.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Banerjee et al. (2005) used a covalent trapping strategy to capture
human OGG1 protein in the act of interrogating normal DNA. The x-ray
structure of the trapped complex features a target G nucleobase extruded
from the DNA helix but denied insertion into the lesion recognition
pocket of the enzyme. Free energy difference calculations showed that
both the attractive and repulsive interactions have an important role in
the preferential binding of 8-oxoG compared with G to the active site.
Banerjee et al. (2005) concluded that the structure reveals an effective
gate-keeping strategy for lesion discrimination and suggests a mechanism
for 8-oxoG insertion into the human OGG1 active site.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Audebert et al. (2000) analyzed 99 renal tumors for alterations in the
OGG1 gene to determine its association with tumorigenesis. Loss of
heterozygosity in the 3p25 region was found in 85% of the informative
cases. They detected somatic missense mutations of the OGG1 gene in 4 of
the 99 tumor samples. Biochemical analysis of the mutant proteins
demonstrated that an arg46-to-gln substitution (601982.0001) impaired
the enzymatic activity. The authors also described several polymorphisms
as well as aberrantly spliced OGG1 transcripts.

In an E. coli complementation assay, Kohno et al. (1998) found that the
DNA repair activity of the cys326 variant of OGG1 is lower than that of
the ser326 variant. Wang et al. (2006) examined the association of the
ser326-to-cys (S326C) variant with insulin sensitivity in 279
glucose-tolerant Taiwanese individuals with no history of cancer.
Individuals with the cys/cys genotype had significantly lower insulin
sensitivity levels compared with the ser/ser and ser/cys genotypes (p
less than 0.001 for both). Multiple linear regression analysis showed
that the cys/cys genotype was independently and significantly associated
with the degree of insulin resistance (p = 0.001).

Kovtun et al. (2007) demonstrated that the age-dependent somatic CAG
expansion associated with Huntington disease (143100) occurs in the
process of removing oxidized base lesions, and is remarkably dependent
on the single-base excision repair enzyme 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine-DNA
glycosylase (OGG1). Both in vivo and in vitro results supported a 'toxic
oxidation' model in which OGG1 initiates an escalating
oxidation-excision cycle that leads to progressive age-dependent
expansion. Kovtun et al. (2007) concluded that age-dependent CAG
expansion provides a direct molecular link between oxidative damage and
toxicity in postmitotic neurons through a DNA damage response, and
error-prone repair of single-strand breaks.

ANIMAL MODEL

Trapp et al. (2007) stated that Ogg1 deficiency in mice leads to
elevated basal levels of 7,8-dihydro-8-oxo-2-prime-deoxyguanosine
(8-oxoG) and increased spontaneous mutation frequency, although repair
of 8-oxoG is not completely abolished. To elucidate the role of CSB
(ERCC6; 609413) in preventing mutations caused by oxidative DNA base
damage, Trapp et al. (2007) generated mice deficient in Ogg1 (Ogg1 -/-),
Csb (Csb m/m, which have a truncating mutation), or both Csb and Ogg1
(Csb m/m Ogg1 -/-) that carried a nontranscribed bacterial lacI gene for
mutation analysis. The overall spontaneous mutation frequency in livers
of Csb m/m Ogg1 -/- mice were elevated compared with heterozygous
control mice and Ogg1 -/- mice. The additional mutations caused by Csb
m/m in the Ogg1 -/- background were mostly GC-to-TA transversions and
small deletions. For all mouse strains, the background levels of
oxidative purine modification in livers correlated linearly with the
number of GC-to-TA transversions. Trapp et al. (2007) concluded that CSB
inhibits spontaneous oxidative DNA base damage in nontranscribed genes.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, CLEAR CELL, SOMATIC
OGG1, ARG46GLN

In a clear cell renal cell carcinoma (144700), Audebert et al. (2000)
found a 445G-A transition in the OGG1 cDNA, predicted to result in an
arg46-to-gln (R46Q) amino acid change. They demonstrated that the DNA
glycosylase/AP lyase activity was drastically reduced in the case of
this mutant; its specific activity was 4-fold lower than that of the

;;4-@NITROPHENYLPHOSPHATASE DOMAIN AND NONNEURONAL SNAP25-LIKE 2; NIPSNAP2;;
NIPSNAP, C. ELEGANS, HOMOLOG OF, 2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Chromosomal region 7p12, which contains the EGFR (131550) gene, is
amplified in approximately 40% of glioblastomas, the most common and
malignant form of central nervous system tumor. By screening DNA from
glioblastomas with ESTs from this region, Wang et al. (1998) identified
a gene that was amplified in 2 of 12 tumors and designated it GBAS
(glioblastoma amplified sequence). The predicted 286-amino acid protein
contains a signal peptide, a transmembrane domain, and 2 tyrosine
phosphorylation sites. Northern blot analysis revealed that the 2.2-kb
GBAS transcript is expressed in various tissues, most abundantly in
heart and skeletal muscle.

Seroussi et al. (1998) identified GBAS as a member of the NIPSNAP gene
family and designated it NIPSNAP2. See NIPSNAP1 (603249). They also
identified cDNAs encoding mouse Nipsnap2. The predicted mouse and human
NIPSNAP2 proteins are 91% identical.

MAPPING

By use of a radiation hybrid panel, Wang et al. (1998) mapped the GBAS
gene to within approximately 880 kb of EGFR at 7p12.

608124	TITLE *608124 XYLOSYLTRANSFERASE 1; XYLT1
;;XT1;;
UDP-D-XYLOSE:PROTEOGLYCAN CORE PROTEIN BETA-D-XYLOSYLTRANSFERASE 1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Xylosyltransferase (XT; EC 2.4.2.26) catalyzes the transfer of
UDP-xylose to serine residues within XT recognition sequences of target
proteins. Addition of this xylose to the core protein is required for
the biosynthesis of the glycosaminoglycan chains characteristic of
proteoglycans.

CLONING

By PCR using degenerate primers designed from tryptic fragments of
purified XT1, followed by 3-prime and 5-prime RACE, Gotting et al.
(2000) cloned a partial XT1 cDNA from a chondrosarcoma cell line cDNA
library. A stable secondary structure assumed by XT1 mRNA prevented
reverse transcription of the 5-prime untranslated region. The authors
determined that the XT1 protein contains at least 827 amino acids and
has a calculated molecular mass of at least 91 kD. It has 3 potential
N-glycosylation sites and a DxD motif essential for binding nucleotide
sugars in glycosyltransferases. Alignment of the XT1 and XT2 (608125)
proteins with Xt1 and Xt2 from rat liver revealed highly conserved
sequences in the central and C-terminal regions of the proteins. RT-PCR
detected XT1 expression in all tissues examined, with highest levels in
placenta, kidney, and pancreas, and lowest expression in skeletal
muscle.

Kuhn et al. (2001) found that XT purified from a choriocarcinoma cell
line showed an apparent molecular mass of about 120 kD. The mass
decreased following glycosidase digestion.

GENE FUNCTION

Gotting et al. (1998) showed that XT was secreted into the medium of
several human cell lines. Highest XT activity was detected in sternal
cartilage chondrocytes, chondrosarcoma, nasal septum tumor, and
choriocarcinoma cells. Activity was also detected in serum, cerebral
spinal fluid, rat serum, and all rat tissue lysates examined. Gotting et
al. (1998) identified XT recognition sequences in leukocyte-derived
isoforms of APP (104760) and APLP2 (104776). Synthetic peptides derived
from these APP and APLP2 isoforms were substrates for XT-mediated
xylosylation in vitro.

Gotting et al. (1999) determined that XT was secreted into the medium by
cultured human dermal fibroblasts. Chondrocytes secreted XT and
chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans simultaneously. Gotting et al. (1999)
detected increased XT activity in the serum of patients with systemic
sclerosis (see 181750) compared with controls, and the activity
correlated with clinical classification. Female patients with diffuse
cutaneous systemic sclerosis showed higher serum XT activity than
patients with limited systemic sclerosis. Gotting et al. (1999)
suggested that XT activity could be used as a diagnostic marker for the
determination of sclerotic activity in this disease.

Gotting et al. (2000) showed that recombinant XT1 expressed in Chinese
hamster ovary cells had XT activity by transferring xylose to the serine
of a test peptide through a beta linkage. The XT activity was inhibited
by the addition of heparin.

Gotting et al. (2002) measured reduced XT activity in seminal plasma of
infertile men compared with healthy donors. Analysis of fractionated
ejaculates revealed that the highest XT activity was associated with the
portion secreted by seminal vesicle glands.

GENE STRUCTURE

Schon et al. (2006) stated that the XYLT1 gene consists of 12 exons and
extends over 300 kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Gotting et al. (2000) mapped the XYLT1
gene to chromosome 16p13.1.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE; 264800) is a heritable disorder of
connective tissue caused by mutations in the ABCC6 gene (603234).
Fragmentation of elastic fibers and deposition of proteoglycans result
in a highly variable clinical picture. The altered proteoglycan
metabolism in the disorder suggested that enzymes from this pathway
function as genetic cofactors in the severity of PXE. Therefore, Schon
et al. (2006) proposed that the XYLT genes, that encoding
xylosyltransferase-1 (XYLT1), the chain-initiating enzyme in the
biosynthesis of proteoglycans, and the highly homologous XYLT2 (608125),
are candidate genes for this cofactor role. They screened all exons of
these 2 genes in 65 German PXE patients using denaturing high
performance liquid chromatography and analyzed the influence of
variations on clinical characteristics. They identified 22 variations in
the XYLT genes. The missense mutation ala115 to ser in XYLT1
(608124.0001) was associated with higher serum XT activity (p = 0.005).
The amino acid substitution thr801to arg in the XYLT2 gene (608125.0001)
occurred with significantly higher frequency in patients under 30 years
of age at diagnosis; all PXE patients with this variation suffered from
skin lesions compared to only 75% of the wildtype patients. The other
variants in the XYLT2 gene were found to be more frequent in patients
with higher organ involvement.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
PSEUDOXANTHOMA ELASTICUM, MODIFIER OF SEVERITY OF
XYLT1, ALA115SER

Schon et al. (2006) found a missense variation in the XYLT1 gene, ala115
to ser (A115S), that was associated with higher serum xylosyltransferase
activity in pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE; 264800) patients when present
in either homozygous or heterozygous state, as compared with patients
carrying the wildtype G allele in homozygous state (p = 0.005). The
amino acid substitution resulted from a 343G-T transversion in exon 1 of
the XYLT1 gene.

602406	TITLE *602406 HEART- AND NEURAL CREST DERIVATIVES-EXPRESSED 1; HAND1
;;HLH TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR HAND1;;
EHAND
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The HAND1 gene encodes a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription
factor that is essential for mammalian heart development
(Reamon-Buettner et al., 2009).

CLONING

Russell et al. (1997) cloned HAND1 from a human fetal cardiac cDNA
library, using the mouse Hand1 sequence as probe. The deduced 215-amino
acid protein contains a bHLH region and several potential
phosphorylation sites. The mouse and human sequences share 93% overall
sequence identity. Northern blot analysis detected a 1.8-kb transcript
in adult human heart, but not in brain, placenta, lung, liver, skeletal
muscle, kidney, or pancreas.

Knofler et al. (1998) cloned HAND1 from a heart-specific cDNA library
screened with a HAND1-specific cDNA fragment originally obtained by
RT-PCR of human choriocarcinoma cell line mRNA. The sequence predicts a
protein calculated to have a molecular mass of 23.6 kD. In vitro
translation results in a 29-kD protein, suggesting posttranslational
modification. Knofler et al. (1998) confirmed expression of HAND1 in
heart and also identified abundant expression in cytotrophoblastic cell
lines. Knofler et al. (2002) found that HAND1 mRNA is specifically
expressed in amniotic cells at different stages of gestation and
demonstrated that the protein is exclusively produced in the amniotic
epithelium in vivo and in purified amnion cells in vitro. RT-PCR and
immunohistochemical staining of blastocysts revealed the production of
HAND1 mRNA and polypeptide in the trophectodermal cell layer.

In mouse, Hand1 and Hand2 (602407) are expressed in the heart and
certain neural crest derivatives during embryogenesis. In addition,
Hand1 is expressed in extraembryonic membranes, whereas Hand2 is
expressed in the deciduum (Cserjesi et al., 1995; Srivastava et al.,
1995).

GENE FUNCTION

Knofler et al. (2002) found that human HAND1 can stimulate
transcriptional activity of E12/E47 (147141) through degenerate E-boxes
(the palindromic sequence CANNTG), or inhibit E12/E47 transcriptional
activity through perfect E-boxes. By mutation analysis, they determined
that 2 regions within the N terminus confers the repressor activity.

GENE STRUCTURE

Knofler et al. (1998) determined that the HAND1 gene contains 2 exons
spanning 3.3 kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Russell et al. (1997) mapped the HAND1
gene to chromosome 5q32.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Reamon-Buettner et al. (2008) sequenced the HAND1 gene in cardiac tissue
from 31 unrelated patients with hypoplastic hearts (see 241550), 24 with
left-sided hypoplasia and 7 with right-sided. A frameshift mutation
(376delG) in the bHLH domain of HAND1 was identified in 24 of 31
hypoplastic ventricles; the mutation was also present in the
nonhypoplastic ventricle in 9 patients. The authors noted that other
sequence alterations were also found in HAND1, but only 376delG was a
predictor for the hypoplastic condition. Examination of 68
formalin-fixed hearts selected for septation defects revealed that only
1, with severe malformations, carried the 376delG frameshift mutation;
the mutation was not found in 10 formalin-fixed or 5 frozen normal
hearts, or in 100 blood samples from healthy volunteers. Yeast-based
assays demonstrated that unlike wildtype HAND1, the 376delG mutant was
unable to modulate transcription of reporter constructs containing
specific DNA-binding sites. Reamon-Buettner et al. (2008) concluded that
HAND1 function is impaired in hypoplastic human hearts.

In tissue samples of human cardiac septal defects, including atrial
septal defects (see ASD1, 108800), ventricular septal defects (see VSD1,
614429), and atrioventricular septal defects (see AVSD1, 606215),
Reamon-Buettner et al. (2009) detected 32 somatic sequence alterations
leading to amino acid changes, of which 12 were in the bHLH domain of
the HAND1 gene. These sequence alterations were not detected in 15
normal heart tissue samples, 12 blood samples from congenital heart
disease patients, or 100 unrelated normal individuals. Functional
studies in yeast and mammalian cells enabled translation of sequence
alterations to HAND1 transcriptional activity, which was reduced or
abolished by certain somatic mutations. Reamon-Buettner et al. (2009)
suggested that HAND1 may also be affected in septation defects of the
human hearts, and thus may have a broader role in human heart
development and congenital heart disease.

ANIMAL MODEL

Firulli et al. (1998) generated a germline mutation in the mouse Hand1
gene by replacing the first coding exon with a beta-galactosidase
reporter gene. Embryos homozygous for the HAND1 null allele died between
embryonic days 8.5 and 9.5 and exhibited yolk sac abnormalities due to a
deficiency in extraembryonic mesoderm. Heart development was also
perturbed and did not progress beyond the cardiac-looping stage. The
results demonstrated important roles for HAND1 in extraembryonic
mesodermal and heart development.

Riley et al. (1998) likewise generated Hand1-null mutant mice by gene
targeting and found that homozygous mutant embryos arrested with defects
in trophoblast giant cell differentiation by embryonic day 7.5 of
gestation. This early mortality could be rescued by aggregation of
mutant embryos with wildtype tetraploid embryos, which contributed
wildtype cells to the trophoblast, but not the embryo. By embryonic day
10.5, however, the Hand1-null fetuses derived from tetraploid chimeras
died due to cardiac failure. Their heart tubes showed abnormal looping
and ventricular myocardial differentiation. Therefore, Hand1 is
essential for differentiation of both trophoblasts and cardiomyocytes,
which are embryologically distinct cell lineages.

;;HLAH
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

El Kahloun et al. (1993) used a yeast artificial chromosome with a
320-kb insert of genomic DNA that included the major histocompatibility
complex class I HLA-A gene (142800) to screen a human duodenal mucosa
cDNA library. They isolated 7 cDNA clones that corresponded to 7 new
non-class I structural genes. Since these genes were located within the
hemochromatosis (HFE1; 235200) candidate gene region, they referred to
the genes as HCG (hemochromatosis candidate gene) I-VII. El Kahloun et
al. (1993) concluded that HCG I, III, V, and VI are probably single-copy
genes situated 180, 155, 140, and 230 kb, respectively, centromeric to
HLA-A. There were several copies of the other 3 genes. Each of the genes
was associated with a CpG/HTF island.

Using cDNA hybridization selection with a 320-kb YAC containing the
HLA-A gene to screen a human duodenal cDNA library, Goei et al. (1994)
isolated and characterized 10 novel gene fragments. Also in search of
the HFE gene, Yaouang et al. (1994) identified a zone of linkage
disequilibrium which suggested that the HFE gene may reside within a
400-kb expanse of DNA between the locus they referred to as i97 and
HLA-F (143110). Totaro et al. (1996) generated a detailed 1.2-Mb
physical and transcription map of 6p spanning the HLA class I region
from HLA-E to approximately 500 kb telomeric of HLA-F. The localization
of known genes was refined, and a new gene from the RNA helicase
superfamily was identified. Overall, 14 transcription units in addition
to the HLA genes were detected and integrated into the map. Thirteen
cDNA fragments showed no similarity with known sequences, and could be
candidates for hemochromatosis.

By linkage disequilibrium and full haplotype analysis of hereditary
hemochromotosis patients, Feder et al. (1996) identified a 250-kb region
more than 3 Mb telomeric of the MHC on chromosome 6 that is identical by
descent in 85% of patient chromosomes. Within this region, they
identified a gene, which they termed HLA-H, that encodes a predicted
343-amino acid protein related to the MHC class I gene family. The
protein comprises a signal sequence, peptide-binding regions (alpha-1
and alpha-2 domains), a transmembrane region, and a small cytoplasmic
portion. One of the most conserved structural features of MHC class I
molecules in HLA-H are the 4 cysteine residues that form disulfide
bridges in the alpha-2 and alpha-3 domains. Northern blot analysis
detected a 4-kb major mRNA transcript in all tissues tested, except
brain.

Searching for new human MHC class I related genes, Hashimoto et al.
(1995) identified MHC-related protein-1 (MR1; 600764) and a second gene,
MR2. The HLA-H gene (HFE) reported by Feder et al. (1996) as a candidate
gene for hereditary hemochromatosis turned out to be identical to the
MR2 gene of Hashimoto et al. (1995). Hashimoto et al. (1997) isolated
the murine homolog of this gene. It was found to be similar to its human
counterpart with an overall predicted amino acid sequence similarity of
approximately 66% and expression in various tissues as in human. An
extra 8 amino acid residues between the alpha-1 and the alpha-2 domains
in the mouse molecule compared to the human counterpart could be
explained by the creation of the additional coding sequence from the
intron.

Thenie et al. (2001) isolated an antisense transcript originating from
the HFE gene locus. The RNA spans exon 1, exon 2, part of intron 1 of
the HFE gene, and 1 kb upstream of it. The antisense transcript is
polyadenylated, but displays no open reading frame, and appears to be
expressed at low levels in all tissues and cell lines tested. In vitro
coupled transcription-translation experiments revealed that HFE
expression is decreased by this antisense RNA, suggesting that it may
play a role in the regulation of HFE gene expression.

NOMENCLATURE

Mercier et al. (1997) urged strongly that the symbol HFE be used for the
hemochromatosis gene rather than 'HLA-H' as used by Feder et al. (1996).
The designation HLA-H was used also for a presumed pseudogene in the HLA
class I region; see 142800. Similarly, Bodmer et al. (1997) argued that
'HLA-H' is an undesirable designation and pointed to the accepted
authority of the WHO Nomenclature Committee for Factors of the HLA
System in determining symbols of genes in this region.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Lebron et al. (1998) determined the 2.6-angstrom crystal structure of
the HFE protein.

GENE STRUCTURE

Feder et al. (1996) determined that the HFE gene contains 7 exons
spanning 12 kb.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis, Hashimoto et al. (1995)
mapped the HFE gene to chromosome 6p22.

The HFE gene maps within the MHC region on chromosome 6p21.3 (Feder et
al., 1996).

Hashimoto et al. (1997) showed that whereas the human gene is located
telomeric to the MHC region on 6p, the mouse homolog was translocated
from the site telomeric to MHC on chromosome 17 to chromosome 13 along
with other genes.

GENE FUNCTION

Parkkila et al. (1997) generated an antibody to a C-terminal peptide and
used it for immunolocalization of the HLA-H protein in the
gastrointestinal tract of Finnish and American subjects presumed not to
have hereditary hemochromatosis. Although staining for the HLA-H protein
was seen in some epithelial cells in every segment of the alimentary
canal, its cellular and subcellular expression in the small intestine
was distinct from that in other segments. In contrast to the stomach and
colon, where staining is polarized and restricted to the basal lateral
surfaces, and in contrast to the epithelial cells of the esophagus and
submucosal leukocytes, which showed nonpolarized staining around the
entire plasma membrane, the staining in the small intestine was mainly
intracellular and perinuclear, limited to cells in deep crypts. Parkkila
et al. (1997) concluded that the unique subcellular localization in the
crypts of the small intestine in proximity to the presumed sites of iron
absorption supported the implication of this protein in the molecular
basis of hemochromatosis.

By immunohistochemistry, Parkkila et al. (1997) demonstrated that the
HFE protein is expressed in human placenta in the apical plasma membrane
of the syncytiotrophoblasts, where the transferrin-bound iron is
normally transported to the fetus via receptor-mediated endocytosis.
Western blot analyses showed that the HFE protein is associated with
beta-2-microglobulin (B2M; 109700) in placental membranes. Unexpectedly,
the transferrin receptor (TFR; 190010) was also found to be associated
with the HFE protein/B2M complex. These studies placed the normal HFE
protein at the site of contact with the maternal circulation where its
association with transferrin receptor raised the possibility that the
HFE protein plays some role in determining maternal/fetal iron
homeostasis.

Feder et al. (1998) demonstrated that the HFE protein forms stable
complexes with the transferrin receptor. Studies on cell-associated
transferrin at 37 degrees C suggested that overexpression of HFE protein
decreases the affinity of TFR for transferrin. Feder et al. (1998)
demonstrated that the mutant H63D (613609.0002) HFE protein found in
patients with hemochromatosis formed stable complexes with TFR, but that
overexpression of H63D did not decrease the affinity of TFR for
transferrin. In contrast, the mutant C282Y (613609.0001) HFE protein
only associated with TFR to a small degree. The results established a
molecular link between the HFE protein and the transferrin receptor,
raising the possibility that alterations in this regulatory mechanism of
iron transport may play a role in the pathogenesis of hereditary
hemochromatosis.

By analyzing the crystal structure of the HFE protein, Lebron et al.
(1998) identified a patch of histidines that could be involved in
pH-dependent interactions. Soluble TFR and HFE bound tightly at the
basic pH of the cell surface, but not at the acidic pH of intracellular
vesicles. TFR:HFE stoichiometry (2:1) differed from TFR:transferrin
stoichiometry (2:2), implying a different mode of binding for HFE and
transferrin to TFR, consistent with the demonstration that HFE,
transferrin, and TFR form a ternary complex. Lebron et al. (1998) used
the crystal structure to reveal the locations of hemochromatosis
mutations.

At the cell surface, HFE complexes with TFRC, increasing the
dissociation constant of transferrin (TF) for its receptor 10-fold. HFE
does not remain at the cell surface, but traffics with TFRC to
transferrin-positive internal compartments. Using a HeLa cell line in
which the expression of HFE is controlled by tetracycline, Roy et al.
(1999) showed that the expression of HFE reduced uptake of radioactive
iron from TF by 33%, but did not affect the endocytic or exocytic rates
of TFRC cycling. Therefore, HFE appears to reduce cellular acquisition
of iron from TF within endocytic compartments. HFE specifically reduces
iron uptake from TF, as non-TF-mediated iron uptake from
Fe-nitrilotriacetic acid was not altered. These results explained the
decreased ferritin levels seen in the HeLa cell system, and demonstrated
the specific control of HFE over the TF-mediated pathway of iron uptake.
These results also have implications for the understanding of cellular
iron homeostasis in organs such as the liver, pancreas, heart, and
spleen that are iron loaded in persons with hereditary hemochromatosis
lacking functional HFE.

The HFE protein normally binds to TFR in competition with transferrin
and, in vitro, reduces cellular iron by reducing iron uptake. However,
in vivo, HFE is strongly expressed by liver macrophages and intestinal
crypt cells, which behave as though they are relatively iron-deficient
in HH. These observations suggest, paradoxically, that expression of
wildtype HFE may lead to iron accumulation in these specialized cell
types. Drakesmith et al. (2002) showed that wildtype HFE protein raises
cellular iron by inhibiting iron efflux from the monocyte/macrophage
cell line, and extended these results to macrophages derived from
healthy individuals and HH patients. They found that the HH-associated
mutant H63D (H41D of the mature protein) lost the ability to inhibit
iron release despite binding to TFR as well as wildtype HFE. They also
showed that the ability of HFE to block iron release is not
competitively inhibited by transferrin. They concluded that HFE has 2
mutually exclusive functions: binding to TFR in competition with
transferrin and inhibition of iron release.

Zoller et al. (2003) studied the mRNA and protein expression and
activity of cytochrome b reductase-1 (CYBRD1; 605745) in duodenal
biopsies of patients with iron deficiency anemia, hereditary
hemochromatosis, and controls. They found that CYBRD1 activity in iron
deficiency is stimulated via enhanced protein expression, whereas in
hemochromatosis due to mutations in the HFE gene it is upregulated
posttranslationally. Hemochromatosis patients with no mutations in HFE
did not have increased CYBRD1 activity. Zoller et al. (2003) concluded
that there are different kinetics of intestinal iron uptake between iron
deficiency and hemochromatosis due to mutations in HFE, and that
duodenal iron accumulation in hereditary hemochromatosis due to
mutations in HFE and hereditary hemochromatosis due to mutations in
other genes is pathophysiologically different.

Drakesmith et al. (2005) found that the Nef protein of human
immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) downregulated macrophage-expressed HFE.
Iron and ferritin accumulation were increased in HIV-1-infected ex vivo
macrophages expressing wildtype HFE. The effect was lost with
Nef-deleted HIV-1 or with infected macrophages from hemochromatosis
patients expressing mutant HFE. Iron accumulation in HIV-1-infected
wildtype macrophages was paralleled by increased cellular HIV-1 Gag
protein expression.

Like classic class Ia MHC molecules, HFE has a peptide-binding groove,
but the HFE groove has no ligand. Rohrlich et al. (2005) studied the
interactions of human and mouse HFE with T lymphocytes and found that
the mouse alpha/beta TCR recognized human HFE, leading to Zap70 (176947)
phosphorylation. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes from mice lacking Hfe were able
to recognize murine Hfe. Rohrlich et al. (2005) proposed that the immune
system may be involved in control of iron metabolism.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In patients with hereditary hemochromatosis (HFE1; 235200), Feder et al.
(1996) identified 2 mutations in the HFE gene (C282Y, 613609.0001 and
H63D, 613609.0002). The C282Y mutation was detected in 85% of all HFE
chromosomes, indicating that in their population 83% of hemochromatosis
cases are related to C282Y homozygosity.

By sequence analysis of exons 2, 3, 4, and 5, and portions of introns 2,
4, and 5 of the HFE gene, Barton et al. (1999) identified novel
mutations in 4 of 20 hemochromatosis probands who lacked C282Y
homozygosity, C282Y/H63D compound heterozygosity, or H63D homozygosity.
Probands 1 and 2 were heterozygous for the previously undescribed
mutations ile105-to-thr (I105T; 613609.0009) and gly93-to-arg (G93R;
613609.0010). Probands 3 and 4 were heterozygous for the previously
described but uncommon HFE mutation ser65-to-cys (S65C; 613609.0003).
Proband 3 was also heterozygous for C282Y and had porphyria cutanea
tarda (see 176100), and proband 4 had hereditary stomatocytosis
(185000). Each of these 4 probands had iron overload. In each proband
with an uncommon HFE coding region mutation, I105T, G93R, and S65C
occurred on separate chromosomes from those with the C282Y or H63D
mutations. Neither I105T, G93R, nor S65C occurred as spontaneous
mutations in these probands. In 176 normal control subjects, 2 were
heterozygous for S65C, but I105T and G93R were not detected.

ANIMAL MODEL

To test the hypothesis that the HFE gene is involved in regulation of
iron homeostasis, Zhou et al. (1998) studied the effects of a targeted
disruption of the murine homolog of the HFE gene. The HFE-deficient mice
showed profound differences in parameters of iron homeostasis. Even on a
standard diet, by 10 weeks of age, fasting transferrin saturation was
significantly elevated compared with normal littermates, and hepatic
iron concentration was 8-fold higher than that of wildtype littermates.
Stainable hepatic iron in the HFE mutant mice was predominantly in
hepatocytes in a periportal distribution. Iron concentrations in spleen,
heart, and kidney were not significantly different from that in
littermates. Erythroid parameters were normal, indicating that the
anemia did not contribute to the increased iron storage. The study
showed that HFE protein is involved in the regulation of iron
homeostasis and that mutations in the gene are responsible for
hereditary hemochromatosis. Beutler (1998) emphasized the pathologic and
clinical importance of the knockout mouse model for hemochromatosis.

The puzzling linkage between genetic hemochromatosis and the
histocompatibility loci became even more puzzling when the gene
involved, HFE, was identified. Indeed, within the well-defined, mainly
peptide-binding, MHC-class I family of molecules, HFE seems to perform
an unusual but essential function. Understanding of HFE function in iron
homeostasis was only partial; an even more open question was its
possible role in the immune system. To advance knowledge in both of
these areas, Bahram et al. (1999) studied deletion of the HFE alpha-1
and alpha-2 putative ligand-binding domains in vivo. HFE-deficient mice
were analyzed for a comprehensive set of metabolic and immune
parameters. Faithfully mimicking human hemochromatosis, mice homozygous
for this deletion developed iron overload, characterized by a higher
plasma iron content and a raised transferrin saturation as well as an
elevated hepatic iron load. The primary defect could, indeed, be traced
to an augmented duodenal iron absorption. In parallel, measurement of
the gut mucosal iron content as well as iron regulatory proteins allowed
a more informed evaluation of various hypotheses regarding the precise
role of HFE in iron homeostasis. However, extensive phenotyping of
primary and secondary lymphoid organs including the gut provided no
compelling evidence for an obvious immune-linked function for HFE.

Inflammation influences iron balance in the whole organism. A common
clinical manifestation of these changes is anemia of chronic disease
(ACD; also called anemia of inflammation). Inflammation reduces duodenal
iron absorption and increases macrophage iron retention, resulting in
low serum iron concentrations (hyposideremia). Despite the protection
hyposideremia provides against proliferating microorganisms, this 'iron
withholding' reduces the iron available to maturing red blood cells and
eventually contributes to the development of anemia. Hepcidin
antimicrobial peptide (HAMP; 606464) is a hepatic defensin-like peptide
hormone that inhibits duodenal iron absorption and macrophage iron
release. HAMP is part of the type II acute phase response and is thought
to have a crucial regulatory role in sequestering iron in the context of
ACD. Roy et al. (2004) reported that mice with deficiencies in the
hemochromatosis gene product, Hfe, mounted a general inflammatory
response after injection of lipopolysaccharide but lacked appropriate
Hamp expression and did not develop hyposideremia. These data suggested
a previously unidentified role for Hfe in innate immunity and ACD.

Nairz et al. (2009) found that mice lacking 1 or both Hfe alleles were
protected from Salmonella typhimurium septicemia, displaying reduced
bacterial replication and prolonged host survival. Increased resistance
was associated with enhanced production of the enterochelin-binding
protein Lcn2 (600181), which reduced iron availability for Salmonella.
Macrophages lacking both Hfe and Lcn2 were unable to efficiently control
S. typhimurium or to withhold iron from the bacterium. Salmonella
lacking enterochelin overcame protection in Hfe -/- mice, as did
wildtype bacteria in Hfe -/- Lcn2 -/- double-knockout mice. Nairz et al.
(2009) concluded that loss of HFE confers host resistance to systemic
Salmonella infection by inducing the iron-capturing peptide LCN2,
thereby providing an evolutionary advantage that may account for the
high prevalence of genetic hemochromatosis.

Drakesmith et al. (2002) used a numbering system beginning from the
first amino acid of the mature protein, omitting the 22 amino acids of
the signal sequence, so that C282 of the immature protein is C260 of the
mature protein.

Hemochromatosis, Type 1

In patients with hemochromatosis (HFE1; 235200), Feder et al. (1996)
identified an 845G-A transition in the HFE gene (which they referred to
as HLA-H or 'cDNA 24'), resulting in a cys282-to-tyr (C282Y)
substitution. This missense mutation occurs in a highly conserved
residue involved in the intramolecular disulfide bridging of MHC class I
proteins, and could therefore disrupt the structure and function of this
protein. Using an allele-specific oligonucleotide-ligation assay on
their group of 178 patients, they detected the C282Y mutation in 85% of
all HFE chromosomes. In contrast, only 10 of the 310 control chromosomes
(3.2%) carried the mutation, a carrier frequency of 10/155 = 6.4%. One
hundred forty-eight of 178 HH patients were homozygous for this
mutation, 9 were heterozygous, and 21 carried only the normal allele.
These numbers were extremely discrepant from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.
The findings corroborated heterogeneity among the hemochromatosis
patients, with 83% of cases related to C282Y homozygosity.

Jazwinska et al. (1996) provided convincing evidence that the C282Y
mutation in homozygous form in the HFE gene is the cause of
hemochromatosis. In studies in Australia, patients properly
characterized at the genotypic and phenotypic level all showed
homozygosity for the C282Y substitution. Irrespective of haplotype, all
HH heterozygotes were cys/tyr heterozygotes, and all homozygous normal
controls were cys/cys homozygotes. The presence of a single mutation in
all patients contrasted with the data of Feder et al. (1996), who
reported a lower frequency of the mutation. Jazwinska et al. (1996)
suggested that different clinical criteria for the diagnosis of HH may
account for the difference, or that HH may not be as homogeneous as
previously believed. They noted that a key question is why there is a
variation in severity of iron loading in HH that is haplotype-related
when the mutation is identical in all haplotypes tested. Jazwinska et
al. (1996) hypothesized that the HFE locus is the primary HH locus, but
that there are likely to be other 6p-linked modifying genes that would
explain both the HLA-linked haplotype variation in expression of the
disorder and the large region of linkage disequilibrium present in all
populations and spanning at least 4.5 Mb distal of D6S265.

Jouanolle et al. (1996) commented on the significance of the C282Y
mutation on the basis of a group of 65 unrelated affected individuals
who had been under study in France for more than 10 years and identified
by stringent criteria. Homozygosity for the C282Y mutation was found in
59 of 65 patients (90.8%); 3 of the patients were compound heterozygotes
for the C282Y mutation and the H63D mutation (613609.0002); 1 was
homozygous for the H63D mutation; and 2 were heterozygous for H63D.
These results corresponded to an allelic frequency of 93.1% for the
C282Y and 5.4% for the H63D mutations, respectively. Of note, the C282Y
mutation was never observed in the family-based controls, whereas it was
present in 5.8% of the general Breton population. This corresponds to a
theoretical frequency of about 1 per 1,000 for the disease, which is
slightly lower than generally estimated. In contrast, the H63D allelic
frequency was nearly the same in both control groups (15% and 16.5% in
the family-based and general population controls, respectively). While
the experience of Jouanolle et al. (1996) appeared to indicate a close
relationship of C282Y to hemochromatosis, the implication of the H63D
variant was not clear.

Beutler et al. (1996) reported mutation analysis of 147 patients with
hereditary hemochromatosis and 193 controls; 121 (82.3%) HH patients
were homozygous for the C282Y mutation and 10 (6.8%) were heterozygous.
All of the C282Y homozygous patients were also homozygous for the
wildtype nucleotide 187C (see H63D; 613609.0002), and all C282Y
heterozygotes had at least 1 copy of 187C. Thus, the 2 nucleotides, 845
and 187, were in complete linkage disequilibrium; nucleotide 187 was a C
on all chromosomes with the 845A (C282Y) mutation. Eight of the 10
heterozygotes for 845A were heterozygous for 187G (H63D).

Among 132 unrelated hemochromatosis patients in Brittany, Jouanolle et
al. (1997) found that 92% were homozygous for the C282Y mutation and
that all 264 chromosomes except 5 carried either the C282Y mutation or
the H63D mutation. The UK Haemochromatosis Consortium (1997) genotyped
115 unrelated hereditary hemochromatosis patients and found that 105
(91%) were homozygous for the C282Y mutation. One of 101 controls was
also found to be homozygous but was subsequently found to have evidence
of iron overload. Compound heterozygosity for the C282Y and H63D
mutations was found in 3 patients who had mild disease and in 4 controls
who had no signs of iron overload. Five patients lacked either mutation,
2 of whom had atypical, early-onset disease.

Feder et al. (1997) confirmed the prediction that the C282Y mutation
would disrupt a critical disulfide bond in the alpha-3 loop of the HFE
protein and abrogate binding of the mutant HFE protein to
beta-2-microglobulin (B2M; 109700), as well as its transport to and
presentation on the cell surface. In vitro, the C282Y mutant HFE protein
failed to associate with endogenous B2M in human embryonic kidney cells
stably transfected with the mutant cDNA. Waheed et al. (1997) found that
whereas the wildtype and H63D HFE proteins associate with beta-2
microglobulin and are expressed on the cell surface of COS-7 cells,
these capabilities are lost by the C282Y HFE protein. They presented
biochemical and immunofluorescence data indicating that the C282Y mutant
protein is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and middle Golgi
compartments, fails to undergo late Golgi processing, and is subject to
accelerated degradation. The block in intracellular transport,
accelerated turnover, and failure of the C282Y protein to be presented
normally on the cell surface provides a possible basis for impaired
function of this mutant protein in hereditary hemochromatosis.

In 478 hemochromatosis probands in Brittany selected from their iron
status markers, primarily serum iron, serum ferritin, and transferrin
saturation, Mura et al. (1997) investigated the relationships between
the hemochromatosis phenotype and genotypes at the HLA-H locus and
surrounding markers. They found that the C282Y substitution is
unambiguously associated with the hemochromatosis phenotype; 81.2% of
all patients were homozygous. The subgroup of heterozygous individuals
showed lower values for serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, and iron
removed by phlebotomy than did the subgroup of hemochromatosis patients
homozygous for C282Y. In the subgroup not homozygous for C282Y, no other
mutation in the HLA-H gene was found; hence, the genotype remained
unclear. The authors suggested additional nongenetic cause, other
mutations, or another gene as explanations for the results in these
patients.

Rhodes et al. (1997) reported haplotype and mutation analysis in a
3-generation family. Three sibs with overt hemochromatosis, 1 male and 2
females aged 50 to 53 years, showed homozygosity for the C282Y mutation.
However, homozygosity for the mutation was detected in an asymptomatic
and biochemically normal 50-year-old male sib of the affected
individuals. Rhodes et al. (1997) concluded that this finding caused
them to question the possibility of population and presymptomatic
screening by genetic testing for hemochromatosis.

Roth et al. (1997) found no instance of the C282Y substitution in the
HFE gene of individuals originating from Algeria, Ethiopia, or Senegal,
whereas it is highly prevalent in populations of European ancestry. The
geographic distribution supported the previously suggested Celtic origin
of hemochromatosis. In contrast, the H63D substitution is not restricted
to European populations. Although absent in the Senegalese, it was found
on about 9% of the chromosomes of the central Ethiopians and Algerians
genotyped for this study. Thus, the H63D substitution must have occurred
earlier than the C282Y substitution.

Merryweather-Clarke et al. (1997) reported the prevalence of the C282Y
and H63D mutations in 2,978 people from 42 different populations
worldwide. The authors found the highest frequency of C282Y in northern
European populations, consistent with the theory of a north European
origin for the mutation. In this report, C282Y was seen rarely in the
African, Asian, and Australasian chromosomes studied, while H63D was
more widely distributed.

Although hemochromatosis is common in Caucasians, affecting more than 1
in 300 individuals of northern European origin, the disorder has not
been recognized in other populations. Cullen et al. (1998) used PCR and
restriction-enzyme digestion to analyze the frequency of the C282Y and
H63D mutations in HLA-typed samples of non-Caucasian populations,
comprising Australian Aboriginal, Chinese, and Pacific Islanders. They
found that the C282Y mutation was present in these populations (allele
frequency 0.32%), and that it was always seen in conjunction with HLA
haplotypes common in Caucasians, suggesting that C282Y may have been
introduced into these populations by Caucasian admixture. They found the
H63D mutation at an allele frequency of 2.68% in the 2 populations
analyzed (Australian Aboriginal and Chinese). In the Australian
Aboriginal samples, H63D was found to be associated with HLA haplotypes
common in Caucasians, again suggesting that it was introduced by recent
admixture. In the Chinese samples analyzed, on the other hand, H63D was
present in association with a wide variety of HLA haplotypes, showing
that this mutation is widespread and likely to predate the more
genetically restricted C282Y mutation.

In European populations, Lucotte (1998) found the frequency of the C282Y
mutation to be 6.88% in Celtics, 6.46% in Nordics, 5.95% in
Anglo-Saxons, 2.53% in southern Europeans, and 1.76% in Russians. They
believed these findings supported the suggestion concerning the Celtic
origin of the mutation. Celtic origin of the mutation was also supported
by the finding of Ryan et al. (1998) of a 14% carrier frequency of the
C282Y allele in Ireland, the highest frequency reported to the time of
report.

Jeffrey et al. (1999) identified a single nucleotide polymorphism
(5569G-A; 613609.0004) in intron 4 of the HFE gene that caused
overestimation of C282Y homozygote prevalence in hemochromatosis.

Beutler et al. (2002) screened 41,038 individuals attending a health
appraisal clinic in the U.S. for the C282Y and H63D (613609.0002) HFE
mutations, and analyzed laboratory data on signs and symptoms of
hemochromatosis as elicited by questionnaire. The most common symptoms
of hemochromatosis were no more prevalent among the 152 identified
homozygotes than among the controls. The age distribution of homozygotes
and compound heterozygotes did not differ significantly from that of
controls; there was no measurable loss of such individuals from the
population during aging. However, there was a significantly increased
prevalence of a history of hepatitis or 'liver trouble' among
homozygotes and in the proportion of homozygotes with increased
concentrations of serum aspartate aminotransferase and collagen IV;
these changes were not related to iron burden or to age. Only 1 of the
152 homozygotes had signs and symptoms that would suggest a diagnosis of
hemochromatosis. Beutler et al. (2002) concluded that the penetrance of
hereditary hemochromatosis is much lower than generally thought. They
estimated that less than 1% of homozygotes develop frank clinical
hemochromatosis.

Poullis et al. (2002) concluded that Beutler et al. (2002)
underestimated the penetrance of the C282Y HFE mutation. The immigration
of Hispanic and Asian populations into southern California may have
influenced the frequency.

Within South Wales, McCune et al. (2002) performed a systematic review
of patients with HH over a 2-year period which revealed that only 1.2%
of adult C282Y homozygotes had been diagnosed with iron overload and
received treatment. In those in whom body iron load could be estimated,
only 51% had more than 4 grams of iron (the diagnostic threshold for
iron overload). McCune et al. (2002) stated that screening the general
UK population by genetic testing could identify thousands of individuals
homozygous for the C282Y mutation, but the majority would not express a
phenotype leading to a diagnosis of HH and would likely remain healthy.
They concluded that until the cofactors determining disease expression
were more fully understood, the benefits of such screening, both to the
individual and to the community, would likely be outweighed by the
costs.

Andersen et al. (2004) undertook to determine the progression rate of
iron overload in hereditary hemochromatosis in individuals in the
general population, and to answer the question of how frequently
asymptomatic C282Y homozygotes identified in the population need to be
screened for manifestations of hemochromatosis in later years. As a
function of biologic age, transferrin saturation and ferritin levels
increase slightly in male and female C282Y homozygotes. None of the
C282Y homozygotes developed clinically overt hemochromatosis. The
authors concluded that most such homozygotes need to be screened for
manifestation of hemochromatosis every 10 to 20 years.

Saric et al. (2006) estimated the frequency of the C282Y mutation to be
1.6% in the population of Serbia and Montenegro. The authors noted that
the frequency of C282Y decreases going from northwest to southeast
Europe, consistent with a Viking or Celtic origin.

Livesey et al. (2004) analyzed the presence of the common mtDNA 16189T-C
variant, which appears to be a risk factor for type 2 diabetes (125853),
in British, French, and Australian C282Y homozygotes and controls, with
known iron status, and in birth cohorts. The frequency of the 16189
variant was found to be elevated in individuals with hemochromatosis who
were homozygous for the C282Y allele, compared with population controls
and with C282Y homozygotes who were asymptomatic. They concluded that
iron loading in C282Y homozygotes with hemochromatosis was exacerbated
by the presence of the 16189 variant.

Allen et al. (2008) reported on a study of HFE mutations in 31,192
persons of northern European descent between ages 40 and 69 years who
participated in the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study and were
followed for an average of 12 years. In a random sample of 1,438
subjects stratified according to HFE genotype, including all 203 C282Y
homozygotes (of whom 108 were women and 95 were men), they obtained
clinical and biochemical data, including 2 sets of iron measurements
performed 12 years apart. Disease related to iron overload was defined
as documented iron overload and one or more of the following conditions:
cirrhosis, liver fibrosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, elevated
aminotransferase levels, physician-diagnosed symptomatic
hemochromatosis, and arthropathy of the second and third
metacarpophalangeal joints. The proportion of C282Y homozygotes with
documented iron overload-related disease was 28.4% for men and 1.2% for
women. Only 1 non-C282Y homozygote (a compound heterozygote with his63
to asp) had documented iron overload-related disease. Male C282Y
homozygotes with a serum ferritin level of 1,000 micrograms per liter or
more were more likely to report fatigue, use of arthritis medicine, and
a history of liver disease than were men who had the wildtype gene.
Waalen and Beutler (2008) and Rienhoff (2008) commented that the study
by Allen et al. (2008) may have overestimated the clinical prevalence
and penetrance of iron-overload disease in C282Y homozygotes.

Levy et al. (1999) produced 2 mutations in the murine Hfe gene. The
first mutation deleted a large portion of the coding sequence,
generating a null allele. The second mutation introduced the C282Y
change into the Hfe gene but otherwise left the gene intact.
Homozygosity for either mutation resulted in postnatal iron loading. The
effects of the null mutation were more severe than the effects of the
C282Y mutation. The mice heterozygous for either mutation accumulated
more iron than normal controls. Although liver iron stores were greatly
increased, splenic iron was decreased. Levy et al. (1999) concluded that
the C282Y mutation does not result in a null allele.

Juvenile Hemochromatosis

Merryweather-Clarke et al. (2003) reported an individual with a juvenile
hemochromatosis (602390) phenotype who was heterozygous for the C282Y
mutation in the HFE gene as well as a 4-bp HAMP frameshift mutation
(606464.0003). In another family, they found the C282Y mutation in HFE
together with a G71D mutation in HAMP (606464.0004). There was a
correlation between severity of iron overload, heterozygosity for a G71D
HAMP mutation, and heterozygosity or homozygosity for the HFE C282Y
mutation.

Porphyria Cutanea Tarda

Roberts et al. (1997) analyzed 41 patients with sporadic porphyria
cutanea tarda and 101 controls for the presence of the C282Y and H63D
mutations. They identified the C282Y mutation in 18 (44%) patients
compared to 11 (11%) controls (relative risk = 6.2; p = 0.00003); 7
patients were homozygotes. In 12 patients, the C282Y mutation was
associated with markers of the HLA-A3-containing ancestral
hemochromatosis haplotype. There was no difference in the frequency of
the H63D mutation between the 2 groups. Roberts et al. (1997) concluded
that inheritance of one or more hemochromatosis genes is an important
susceptibility factor for sporadic porphyria cutanea tarda. They noted
that some C282Y homozygotes present late in life with porphyria cutanea
tarda, indicating that not all homozygotes present clinically with
hemochromatosis.

Among 8 patients with porphyria cutanea tarda, Mehrany et al. (2004)
found that 6 had mutations in the HFE gene: 3 were homozygous for C282Y,
1 was compound heterozygous for C282Y and H63D, and 2 were heterozygous
for C282Y. Mehrany et al. (2004) noted that early detection and
treatment of hereditary hemochromatosis limits progression of PCT and
improves life expectancy.

Porphyria Variegata

De Villiers et al. (1999) found that the mutant allele frequency of the
C282Y mutation was significantly lower in 73 apparently unrelated
variegate porphyria (176200) patients with the arg59-to-trp mutation in
the PPOX gene (600923.0003) than in 102 controls drawn from the same
population (P = 0.005). The authors concluded that the population
screening approach used in this study revealed considerable genotypic
variation in the HFE gene and supported previous data on involvement of
the HFE gene in the porphyria phenotype. Iron overload is a
well-established precipitating or aggravating factor in porphyria
variegata.

Susceptibility to Microvascular Complications of Diabetes 7

Walsh and Malins (1978) reported an association between diabetic
retinopathy (MVCD7; 603933) and idiopathic hemochromatosis. Peterlin et
al. (2003) searched for a relationship between the C282Y and H63D gene
mutations and the development of proliferative diabetic retinopathy in
Caucasians with type 2 diabetes (125853). A significantly higher
frequency of C282Y heterozygosity was found in patients with
proliferative diabetic retinopathy compared to subjects without it,
whereas no association was demonstrated with H63D. Logistic regression
analysis revealed that the C282Y mutation was a significant independent
risk factor for the development of PDR (odds ratio = 6.1; p = 0.027).

Oliva et al. (2004) analyzed the C282Y HFE polymorphism in 225 Spanish
patients with type 2 diabetes and detected a younger age of onset and
longer duration of disease in patients carrying at least 1 C282Y allele.
They also found an increased prevalence of retinopathy (p = 0.014) and
of nephropathy (p = 0.04) in individuals carrying at least 1 C282Y
allele; the increased prevalence of retinopathy, but not nephropathy, in
C282Y carriers was related to increased duration of disease.
Multivariate logistic regression analysis confirmed that the prevalence
of nephropathy was higher in the group of patients carrying at least 1 Y
allele.

Davis et al. (2008) analyzed H63D and C282Y HFE genotype data for 1,245
Australian patients with type 2 diabetes from the longitudinal
observational Fremantle Diabetes Study and found no independent positive
associations between HFE gene status and either microvascular or
macrovascular complications in cross-sectional and longitudinal
analyses.

Alzheimer Disease

Robson et al. (2004) noted that there is evidence that iron may play a
role in the pathology of Alzheimer disease (104300). Thus, genetic
factors that contribute to iron deposition resulting in tissue damage
might exacerbate AD. The authors examined the interaction between the C2
variant of the TF gene (19000.0004) and the C282Y allele of the HFE
gene, the most common basis of hemochromatosis, as risk factors for
developing AD. The results showed that each of the 2 variants was
associated with an increased risk of AD only in the presence of the
other. Neither allele alone had any effect. Carriers of both variants
were at 5 times greater risk of AD compared with all others.
Furthermore, carriers of these 2 alleles plus APOE4 (see 107741) were at
still higher risk of AD: of the 14 carriers of the 3 variants identified
in this study, 12 had AD and 2 had mild cognitive impairment. Robson et
al. (2004) concluded that their results indicated that the combination
of TF*C2 and HFE C282Y may lead to an excess of redoxactive iron and the
induction of oxidative stress in neurons, which is exacerbated in
carriers of APOE4. They noted that 4% of northern Europeans carry the 2
iron-related variants and that iron overload is a treatable condition.

Transferrin Serum Level Quantitative Trait Locus 2

In a genomewide association study of Australians of European descent,
Benyamin et al. (2009) found that the C282Y variant (dbSNP rs1800562)
was associated with serum iron (p = 3.5 x 10(-11)), serum transferrin
(see TFQTL2, 614193) (p = 1.1 x 10(-10)), transferrin saturation (p =
4.3 x 10(-15)), and serum ferritin (see FTH1, 134770) (p = 4.5 x
10(-5)). C282Y explained 9.5%, 9.1%, 13.2%, and 3.7% of the variation in
means of serum iron, serum transferrin, transferrin saturation, and
serum ferritin levels, respectively. Three SNPs in the TF gene plus the
HFE C282Y mutation explained about 40% of genetic variation in serum
transferrin (p = 7.8 x 10(-25)).

.0002
HEMOCHROMATOSIS, TYPE 1
MICROVASCULAR COMPLICATIONS OF DIABETES, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, 7, INCLUDED
HFE, HIS63ASP

Drakesmith et al. (2002) used a numbering system beginning with the
first amino acid of the mature HFE protein, omitting the 22 amino acids
of the signal sequence, so that H63 of the immature protein is H41 in
the mature protein.

Hemochromatosis, Type 1

In 9 patients with hemochromatosis (HFE1; 235200) who were heterozygous
for the C282Y mutation (613609.0001), Feder et al. (1996) identified a
C-to-G transversion in exon 2 of the HFE gene, resulting in a
his63-to-asp substitution (H63D). This variant was present in 8 of the 9
(89%) nonancestral chromosomes, representing a significant enrichment
over the 17% frequency observed in control chromosomes. One patient was
homozygous for the H63D variant.

An analysis of the H63D mutation in 13 families by Jouanolle et al.
(1996) did not support a relationship to HFE. The mutation was present
in 3 of 26 heterozygous parents of probands and in each case it was
present on the normal chromosome; the analysis of these individuals did
not support a compound heterozygous contribution to HFE.

In a study of 115 unrelated patients with hereditary hemochromatosis,
the UK Haemochromatosis Consortium (1997) found 1 patient who was
homozygous for the H63D mutation. However, 3 homozygotes with no
evidence of iron overloading were found among 101 control samples
derived from healthy blood donors. In addition, compound heterozygosity
for the H63D and C232Y mutations was found in 3 patients and 4 controls.

Beutler (1997), commenting on the conclusion of Carella et al. (1997)
that H63D is a polymorphic change, assembled evidence supporting the
likelihood that it is a hemochromatosis-causing mutation with reduced
penetrance. He suggested that most of the heterozygotes with mild
disease manifestations reported before discovery of the HFE gene will
prove, in fact, to be compound heterozygotes for C282Y (613609.0001) and
H63D.

Aguilar-Martinez et al. (2001) investigated the phenotypic consequences
of H63D homozygosity in 56 French homozygotes identified from a series
of blood samples submitted for HFE genotyping in response to a confirmed
(12) or suspected (38) clinical diagnosis of hemochromatosis or a family
history of hemochromatosis (6). Of these, 50 (89%) had evidence of iron
overload. In 16 individuals (32%) this appeared to be a phenomenon
secondary to dysmetabolic iron overload syndrome, porphyria cutanea
tarda, alcohol use, or hepatitis. In the remaining 34 (68%) individuals
a secondary cause of iron overload was not identified: 12 had a
phenotypic diagnosis of hemochromatosis and the remaining 22 had
ill-defined, variable degrees of iron overload with no apparent cause.
Extended genetic analysis failed to demonstrate any association between
phenotype and other HFE mutations/polymorphisms or the TFR2 Y250X
mutation (604720.0001)/TFR2 polymorphisms. The authors commented that,
in this selected population, H63D homozygosity was associated with
extremely variable phenotypes. They suggested that factors such as age
and sex may be important nongenetic phenotypic modifiers.

Cardoso et al. (2002) analyzed linkage disequilibrium between HLA
alleles and HFE mutations in a Portuguese population. The results
confirmed linkage disequilibrium of the HLA haplotype HLA-A3-B7 and the
HLA-A29 allele, respectively, with the HFE mutations C282Y and H63D.
Extensions of these studies showed significant linkage disequilibrium
between the H63D mutation and all HLA-A29-containing haplotypes,
favoring the hypothesis of a coselection of H63D and the HLA-A29 allele
itself. Insight into the biologic significance of this association was
given by the finding of significantly higher CD8+ T-lymphocyte counts in
subjects simultaneously carrying the H63D mutation and the HLA-A29
allele.

To examine whether the HFE H63D mutation is pathogenic, Tomatsu et al.
(2003) generated knockin mice homozygous for H67D (corresponding to
human H63D), mice homozygous for C294Y (corresponding to human C282Y),
and mice compound heterozygous for both mutations. The biochemical and
histopathologic severity of hepatic iron loading was significantly
increased in all 3 groups compared to control mice, but was less in H67D
homozygotes than in compound heterozygotes, and was highest in C294Y
homozygotes. Only the C294Y homozygous mice showed a significant
increase in transferrin saturation compared to controls. Tomatsu et al.
(2003) concluded that the H67D allele, when homozygous or combined with
a more severe mutation, leads to partial loss of Hfe function in mice
and to increased hepatic iron loading.

Susceptibility to Microvascular Complications of Diabetes 7

Moczulski et al. (2001) analyzed the H63D polymorphism in 563 Polish
patients with type 2 diabetes (125853) and 196 controls and observed an
increased frequency of the 63D allele (odds ratio, 1.8) among patients
with diabetic nephropathy (MVCD7; 612635).

In a study of 225 Spanish patients with type 2 diabetes, Oliva et al.
(2004) found that the prevalence of nephropathy was higher in the group
of patients carrying the homozygous D/D genotype compared to the group
carrying the wildtype or heterozygous D genotypes.

Davis et al. (2008) analyzed H63D and C282Y HFE genotype data for 1,245
Australian patients with type 2 diabetes from the longitudinal
observational Fremantle Diabetes Study and found no independent positive
associations between HFE gene status and either microvascular or
macrovascular complications in cross-sectional and longitudinal
analyses.

.0003
HEMOCHROMATOSIS, TYPE 1
HFE, SER65CYS

Mura et al. (1999) reported on the analysis of the cys282-to-tyr (C282Y;
613609.0001), his63-to-asp (H63D; 613609.0002), and ser65-to-cys (S65C)
mutations of the HFE gene in a series of 711 probands with hereditary
hemochromatosis (235200) and 410 controls. The results confirmed that
the C282Y substitution is the main mutation involved in HH, accounting
for 85% of carrier chromosomes, whereas the H63D substitution
represented 39% of the HH chromosomes that did not carry the C282Y
mutation. In addition, the screening showed that the S65C substitution,
which results from a 193A-T transversion, was significantly enriched in
probands with at least 1 chromosome without an assigned mutation. This
substitution accounted for 7.8% of HH chromosomes that were neither
C282Y nor H63D. This enrichment of S65C among HH chromosomes suggested
that the S65C substitution is associated with a mild form of
hemochromatosis.

Barton et al. (1999) identified the S65C mutation in 2 patients. One was
also heterozygous for C282Y, i.e., was a compound heterozygote, and had
porphyria cutanea tarda (see 176100). The other patient had hereditary
stomatocytosis (185000). Iron overload due to the HFE mutations probably
precipitated or exacerbated the porphyria cutanea tarda in the first
patient. In the second patient, iron overload from the hereditary
stomatocytosis undoubtedly exacerbated the iron overload due to the HFE
mutation.

.0004
HFE INTRONIC POLYMORPHISM
HFE, 5569G-A

In a population screening study of 5,211 voluntary blood donors, Jeffrey
et al. (1999) identified 31 putative 5474A (613609.0001) homozygotes.
When they validated the assay by genomic DNA sequence analysis, only 16
individuals were confirmed to be 5474A homozygotes and the remaining 15
were heterozygous for this mutation. Each of the 5474A heterozygotes was
also heterozygous for a previously unrecognized 5569G-A single
nucleotide polymorphism located in the binding region of the antisense
primer. Jeffrey et al. (1999) developed a new antisense primer that
excluded the site of this newly found polymorphism and confirmed the 15
putative homozygotes to be 5474A heterozygotes using restriction
endonuclease digestion. Hill and Robertson's maximum likelihood estimate
of linkage disequilibrium D (Hill and Robertson, 1968) was 0.71 (P less
than 0.005), confirming the presence of moderate to strong linkage
disequilibrium between the 2 variant sites. It was considered unlikely
that the 5569A polymorphism has functional significance, because it is
within intron 4 and does not disrupt a splice site consensus sequence.
Moreover, all 5474A/5569A compound heterozygotes had a transferrin
saturation in the normal range. In their population survey, Jeffrey et
al. (1999) found that 21% of 113 normal patients, corresponding to an
allele frequency of 0.106, had the polymorphism. In their sample, the
prevalence of hemochromatosis was reduced from 1 in 168 to 1 in 327 by
the use of new primers. These results had major public health
implications regarding the use of population screening for
hemochromatosis. Individuals previously considered to be nonexpressing
5474A homozygotes on the basis of PCR-based restriction endonuclease
digestion assay using the original Feder et al. (1996) primers require
confirmatory testing.

The European Haemochromatosis Consortium (1999), representing 11
laboratories, retyped 944 samples for the C282Y mutation (613609.0001)
by a primer external to the 5569G-A polymorphism or by sequencing. Five
hundred seventy-five previously diagnosed C282Y homozygotes were
confirmed using the new primer, as well as 192 C282Y wildtype
homozygotes, including 10 carrying the polymorphism in homozygosity, and
177 heterozygotes. Of the heterozygotes, 28 were C282Y/5569G-A compound
heterozygotes which had been reported correctly using the original Feder
reverse primer. The European Haemochromatosis Consortium (1999) did not
observe nonamplification of the polymorphic allele, demonstrating that
the validity of their previous publications was not compromised by
findings reported by Jeffrey et al. (1999). Noll et al. (1999) confirmed
the observations of the European Haemochromatosis Consortium (1999).
Gomez et al. (1999) reevaluated 221 putative C282Y homozygotes; 219 were
confirmed and 2 were found to be 5569A/282Y compound heterozygotes
without clinical evidence of iron overload. There was a significantly
higher prevalence of the 5569A allele in a group of healthy controls (33
of 314, or 10.5%) than in the putative HFE C282Y homozygous group (2 of
442, or 0.45%), suggesting that the polymorphism is very common, but is
not found on the same founder chromosome as the C282Y mutation.

HFE POLYMORPHISM
HFE, VAL53MET

In a mutation analysis of the HFE gene using DNA samples from members of
4 different ethnic groups in South Africa, de Villiers et al. (1999)
identified a 157G-A transition in exon 2 of the HFE gene, resulting in a
val53-to-met (V53M) substitution. The mutation was detected only in
South African Black and Bushman (Khoisan) populations. The mutation
created a new NlaIII site and abolished an MaeII site.

.0006
HFE POLYMORPHISM
HFE, VAL59MET

In a mutation analysis of the HFE gene using DNA samples from members of
4 different ethnic groups in South Africa, de Villiers et al. (1999)
identified a 175G-A transition in exon 2 of the HFE gene, resulting in a
val59-to-met (V59M) substitution in a South African Caucasian. The
mutation created an NlaIII site.

.0007
HEMOCHROMATOSIS, TYPE 1
HFE, GLN127HIS

In an 11-year-old girl with hemochromatosis (235200) and variegate
porphyria (176200), de Villiers et al. (1999) identified compound
heterozygosity for mutations in the HFE gene: a 381A-C transversion in
exon 3 resulting in a gln127-to-his (Q127H) substitution, and a
his63-to-asp (613609.0002) substitution. The severely affected patient
carried the R59W mutation (600923.0003) in the PPOX gene, which accounts
for dominantly inherited variegate porphyria in more than 80% of
affected South Africans. Iron overload is a well-established
precipitating or exacerbating factor in porphyria variegata.

.0008
HEMOCHROMATOSIS, TYPE 1
HFE, ARG330MET

Among 13 Caucasian South African patients referred for a molecular
diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis (235200), de Villiers et al.
(1999) identified a 989G-T transversion in exon 5 of the HFE gene,
resulting in an arg330-to-met (R330M) substitution.

.0009
HEMOCHROMATOSIS, TYPE 1
HFE, ILE105THR

In a patient with hemochromatosis (235200), Barton et al. (1999)
identified compound heterozygosity for a 314T-C transition in exon 2 of
the HFE gene, resulting in an ile105-to-thr (I105T) substitution, and
the H63D mutation (613609.0002).

.0010
HEMOCHROMATOSIS, TYPE 1
HFE, GLY93ARG

In a patient with hemochromatosis (235200), Barton et al. (1999)
identified compound heterozygosity for a 277G-C transversion in exon 2
of the HFE gene, resulting in a gly93-to-arg (G93R) substitution, and
the C282Y mutation (613609.0001).

.0011
HEMOCHROMATOSIS, TYPE 1
HFE, GLN283PRO

In affected members of a French family with hemochromatosis (235200), Le
Gac et al. (2003) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in
the HFE gene: an 848A-C transversion in exon 4, resulting in a
gln283-to-pro (Q283P) substitution within the alpha-3 domain, and a
C282Y (613609.0001) substitution. Molecular modeling studies predicted a
destabilizing effect for the Q283P substitution on the tertiary
structure of the protein.

By performing immunoprecipitation studies in HeLa cells, Ka et al.
(2005) found that the Q283P mutation prevented the normal interaction
between HFE protein and beta-2-microglobulin (B2M; 109700) and between
HFE protein and transferrin receptor (TFRC; 190010). Further studies
showed that the Q283P mutation decreased the capacity of HFE to reduce
transferrin-mediated iron uptake. Ka et al. (2005) noted that the Q283P
mutation is adjacent to the disulfide bridge formed by cys225 and
cys282, and concluded that the Q283P protein is retained in the
endoplasmic reticulum and middle Golgi compartments, similar to the
C282Y mutant protein. The results indicated that the Q283P mutation
leads to structural and functional consequences similar to those
described for the more common C282Y mutation.

611725	TITLE *611725 POTASSIUM CHANNEL TETRAMERIZATION DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 7; KCTD7
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the KCTD gene family, including KCTD7, encode predicted
proteins containing an N-terminal domain that is homologous to the T1
domain in voltage-gated potassium channels (see KCNA1, 176260). KCTD7
displays a primary sequence and hydropathy profile indicating
intracytoplasmic localization. EST database analysis showed that KCTD7
is expressed in human and mouse brain (Van Bogaert et al., 2007).

CLONING

Staropoli et al. (2012) detected expression of a full-length 31-kD Kctd7
isoform in mouse brain. Other major immunoreactive bands included a
28-kD species in the spleen, liver, and kidneys, a 37-kD species in the
kidneys, and a 62-kD form most likely corresponding to a stable dimer.
The presence of multiple bands was consistent with alternative splicing
and tissue-specific regulation.

Kousi et al. (2012) found expression of the Kctd7 gene in cultured mouse
hippocampal cells. Expression was found in the cell soma, in neuritic
varicosities along the developing neuronal extensions, and in neurite
growth cones, but not in the nucleus. Kctd7 was widely expressed in
neurons throughout the intact mouse brain, including in cortical
neurons, in granular and pyramidal cell layers of the hippocampus, and
in cerebellar Purkinje cells. However, not all neuronal cells were
immunopositive for Kctd7, and expression was not seen in astrocytes or
microglial cells. Expression was constant from P5 to 2 months in
cerebellar lysates. Overexpression of KCTD7 in HeLa and COS-1 cells,
which do not express endogenous KCTD7, showed diffuse cytosolic
localization, with no colocalization with markers for endosomes, ER,
Golgi, lysosomes, or the cytoskeleton.

MAPPING

The KCTD7 gene maps to chromosome 7q11.2 (Van Bogaert et al., 2007).

GENE FUNCTION

Azizieh et al. (2011) demonstrated that KCTD7 expression hyperpolarizes
the cell membrane and reduces the excitability of transfected neurons in
patch clamp experiments. Kctd7 was expressed in hippocampal and Purkinje
cells of the murine brain. Immunoprecipitation assays showed that KCTD7
directly interacted with cullin-3 (CUL3; 603136), a component of the
ubiquitin ligase complex.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 3 affected members of a large consanguineous Moroccan family with
progressive myoclonic epilepsy-3 (EPM3; 611726), Van Bogaert et al.
(2007) identified a homozygous mutation in the KCTD7 gene (611725.0001).

In 2 Mexican sibs with infantile onset of progressive myoclonic epilepsy
and pathologic findings of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis in multiple
cell types, Staropoli et al. (2012) identified a homozygous mutation in
the KCTD7 gene (R184C; 611725.0002). The mutation was identified by
whole-exome sequencing and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Staropoli et
al. (2012) designated the phenotype CLN14 (611726). KCTD7 mutations were
not found in 32 additional CLN samples.

In affected members of 7 unrelated families with progressive myoclonic
epilepsy-3, Kousi et al. (2012) identified 6 different mutations in the
KCTD7 gene (see, e.g., 611725.0003-611725.0007). All mutations were in
the homozygous or compound heterozygous state. The initial mutations
were found in 2 probands by homozygosity mapping followed by candidate
gene sequencing, and the other mutations were found by screening of the
gene in 108 Turkish patients and 1 Pakistani patient with the phenotype.
Four mutations were missense, 1 was an in-frame deletion, and 1 was
truncating. None of the patients with KCTD7 mutations tested had
evidence of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis on skin biopsy, and none of
22 additional patients with neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis carried
mutations in the KCTD7 gene.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
EPILEPSY, PROGRESSIVE MYOCLONIC 3, WITHOUT INTRACELLULAR INCLUSIONS
KCTD7, ARG99TER

In 3 affected members of a large consanguineous Moroccan family with
progressive myoclonic epilepsy-3 (611726), Van Bogaert et al. (2007)
identified a homozygous C-to-T transition in exon 2 of the KCTD7 gene,
resulting in an arg99-to-ter (R99X) substitution. The patients had onset
of myoclonic seizures and neurodegeneration between 16 and 24 months of
age. The phenotype was severe and included mental retardation. The
unaffected parents were heterozygous for the mutation. Ultrastructural
analysis of a skin biopsy was normal.

KCTD7, ARG184CYS

In 2 Mexican sibs with infantile onset of progressive myoclonic epilepsy
(611726) and intracellular inclusions, consistent with a diagnosis of
neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (designated CLN14), Staropoli et al.
(2012) identified a homozygous 550C-T transition in exon 4 of the KCTD7
gene, resulting in an arg184-to-cys (R184C) substitution. The mutation
was found by exome sequencing and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Each
unaffected parent was heterozygous for the mutation, which was not found
in over 6,000 controls. In cerebellar cells, wildtype KCTD7 showed
broad, punctate cytoplasmic localization and distinct signal at the
plasma membrane, whereas mutant A184C showed more diffuse cytoplasmic
localization, markedly diminished signaling at the plasma membrane, and
prominent cytoplasmic aggregates. These results suggested that the
mutation affects the trafficking and/or solubility of KCTD7. Studies in
HEK293T cells showed that the R184C mutation abrogated the interaction
with cullin-3 (CUL3; 603136), which Staropoli et al. (2012) suggested
may lead to an accumulation of toxic intracellular proteins.

In 2 unrelated Turkish patients with EPM3 (611726), Kousi et al. (2012)

In a Turkish boy with EPM3 (611726), Kousi et al. (2012) identified a
homozygous 818A-T transversion in exon 4 of the KCTD7 gene, resulting in
an asn273-to-ile (N273I) substitution at a highly conserved residue.
Another Turkish boy with the disorder was compound heterozygous for
N273I and a 343G-T transversion, resulting in an asp115-to-tyr (D115Y;
611725.0006) substitution. The D115Y substitution did not occur at a
highly conserved residue and was predicted to be benign, but neither
mutation was found in 150 Turkish control chromosomes.

171190	TITLE *171190 PHENYLETHANOLAMINE N-METHYLTRANSFERASE; PNMT
;;PENT
DESCRIPTION Phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT; EC 2.1.1.28) catalyzes the
synthesis of epinephrine from norepinephrine, the last step of
catecholamine biosynthesis. To isolate a cDNA clone for human PNMT,
Kaneda et al. (1988) first isolated a cDNA clone for bovine adrenal
medulla PNMT using mixed oligodeoxyribonucleotide probes whose synthesis
was based on the partial amino acid sequence of tryptic peptides from
the bovine enzyme. Using a bovine cDNA as a probe, they screened a human
pheochromocytoma cDNA library and isolated a cDNA clone with an insert
of about 1.0 kb, which contained a complete coding region of the enzyme.
Northern blot analysis of human pheochromocytoma polyadenylated RNA
using this cDNA insert as the probe demonstrated a single RNA species of
about 1,000 nucleotides, suggesting that this clone is a full-length
cDNA. The nucleotide sequence showed that human PNMT has 282 amino acid
residues with a predicted molecular weight of 30,853, including the
initial methionine. The amino acid sequence was 88% homologous to that
of bovine enzyme. Baetge et al. (1988) found that the PNMT gene consists
of 3 exons and 2 introns spanning about 2,100 basepairs. They
demonstrated that in transgenic mice the gene is expressed in adrenal
medulla and retina. A hybrid gene consisting of 2 kb of the PNMT
5-prime-flanking region fused to the simian virus 40 early region also
resulted in tumor antigen mRNA expression in adrenal glands and eyes;
furthermore, immunocytochemistry showed that the tumor antigen was
localized in nuclei of adrenal medullary cells and cells of the inner
nuclear cell layer of the retina, both prominent sites of epinephrine
synthesis. The results indicate that the enhancer(s) for appropriate
expression of the gene in these cell types are in the 2-kb
5-prime-flanking region of the gene.

Kaneda et al. (1988) assigned the human PNMT gene to chromosome 17 by
Southern blot analysis of DNA from mouse-human somatic cell hybrids.
Hoehe et al. (1989) assigned PNMT to chromosome 17 by probing of DNA
from somatic cell hybrids and demonstrated a RFLP. Hoehe et al. (1992)
narrowed the localization to 17q21-q22 by linkage analysis using RFLPs
related to the PNMT gene and several 17q DNA markers. The findings are
of interest in light of the description by Hilbert et al. (1991) and
Jacob et al. (1991) of a genetic locus associated with blood pressure
regulation in the stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR-SP)
on rat chromosome 10 in a conserved linkage synteny group corresponding
to human chromosome 17q22-q24. See essential hypertension (145500).

;;LATE ENVELOPE PROTEIN 8; LEP8
DESCRIPTION For background information on the LCE gene cluster, see 612603.

CLONING

By database analysis to identify human orthologs of mouse genes encoding
late envelope proteins (LEPs), Marshall et al. (2001) identified LCE4A,
which they called LEP8.

Using real-time PCR, Jackson et al. (2005) detected very low LCE4A
expression in adult and fetal skin. Little to no expression was detected
in vulva, tongue, and esophagus.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Marshall et al. (2001) mapped the LCE4A
gene to the LCE gene cluster on chromosome 1q21. Jackson et al. (2005)
stated that the mouse Lce4a gene maps to a syntenic LCE gene cluster on
chromosome 3F1.

;;MYSTIQUE;;
STAT-INTERACTING LIM PROTEIN; SLIM
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Torrado et al. (2004) cloned rat Pdlim2 from eye total RNA. They
identified human PDLIM2 clones in retina, lens, retinal pigment
epithelium/choroid, and fetal eye cDNA libraries. Northern blot analysis
detected high expression in rat cornea and lower expression in sclera,
lung, and combined trabecular meshwork, iris, and ciliary body. No
expression was detected in retina. In situ hybridization of rat eye
tissues detected Pdlim2 in corneal epithelial cells, but not in corneal
stroma or endothelium or in other ocular tissues.

By searching a database for sequences similar to mouse Mystique,
followed by RT-PCR of breast cancer cell line mRNA, Loughran et al.
(2005) cloned 3 human Mystique variants that they called Mystique-1, -2,
and -3. The deduced proteins contain 366, 352, and 278 amino acids and
have calculated molecular masses of 39.2, 37.5, and 29.1 kD,
respectively. Mystique-1 and -2 have an N-terminal PDZ domain and a
C-terminal LIM domain separated by about 200 amino acids, but they
differ at their C termini. Mystique-3 has only the PDZ domain due to the
absence of exon 9 and introduction of a premature stop codon. RT-PCR
suggested there may be 2 additional human Mystique splice variants.
Northern blot analysis of mouse tissues showed tissue-specific
expression of 3 Mystique splice variants. Mystique-2 was the predominant
transcript in most tissues and was highly expressed in lung. Transient
expression of the 3 human cDNAs in HeLa cells showed Mystique-1 and -2
predominantly localized at the cytoskeleton and Mystique-3 localized
predominantly in the nucleus and more weakly near the cytoskeleton.
Western blot analysis detected endogenous Mystique-2 at an apparent
molecular mass of 37.5 kD in 3 of 5 human cell lines examined; other
Mystique isoforms were not detected. Mystique-2 colocalized with
alpha-actinin (see ACTN1; 102575) and beta-1-integrin (ITGB1; 135630) in
breast cancer cells.

By yeast 2-hybrid screening of a mouse Th1 clone cDNA library using the
N-terminal 133 amino acids of mouse Stat4 (600558) as bait, Tanaka et
al. (2005) isolated Pdlim2, which they called Slim. The predicted
349-amino acid mouse Slim protein has an N-terminal PDZ domain and a
C-terminal LIM domain. Northern blot analysis of mouse tissues detected
highest expression of Slim in lung, with strong expression in spleen and
thymus as well. Slim was highly expressed in primary mouse Cd4
(186940)-positive T cells, Cd8 (see 186910)-positive T cells, B cells,
macrophages, and dendritic cells. Western blot analysis showed that Slim
was present in nuclear but not cytoplasmic extracts of primary
Cd4-positive T cells both before and after stimulation with Il12 (see
161560).

GENE FUNCTION

Torrado et al. (2004) found that Pdlim2 coimmunoprecipitated with Actn1,
Actn4 (604638), filamin A (FLNA; 300017), and myosin heavy polypeptide-9
(MYH9; 160775) in rat corneal and lung extracts. Myosin VI (MYO6;
600970) coimmunoprecipitated with Pdlim2 from corneal but not lung
extracts. Alpha-actinins were the most abundant immunoprecipitated
proteins. Pull-down assays and gel overlay assays with purified proteins
confirmed direct interaction of Pdlim2 with alpha-actinins and filamin.
Pdlim2 and alpha-actinins colocalized mainly to stress fibers after
transfection into COS-7 cells, and complexes of Pdlim2 and Actn1
preferentially located along the basal aspect.

Loughran et al. (2005) found that expression of human Mystique-2 was
induced by IGF1 (147440) and cell adhesion. Overexpression of Mystique-2
in a breast cancer cell line suppressed anchorage-independent growth and
enhanced cell adhesion to collagen (see 120150) and fibronectin (FN1;
135600). Point mutation within either the PDZ and LIM domains reversed
the growth suppression, whereas mutation of the PDZ domain alone
abolished the enhancement of cell adhesion. Knockdown of Mystique-2 with
small interfering RNA abrogated both adhesion and migration in 2 breast
cancer cell lines. Loughran et al. (2005) concluded that Mystique is an
IGF1R (147370)-regulated adaptor protein located at the actin
cytoskeleton that is necessary for epithelial cell migration.

By yeast 2-hybrid, coimmunoprecipitation, and Western blot analyses,
Tanaka et al. (2005) showed that mouse Slim interacted with
tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat4. Cotransfection analysis revealed that
Slim impaired Stat-mediated gene expression and that Slim possessed
ubiquitin E3 ligase activity. Immunoblot analysis also showed that Slim
promoted degradation and dephosphorylation of Stat4. Slim -/-
Cd4-positive mouse T cells showed enhanced Ifng (147570) production, and
Slim -/- mice had an enhanced inflammatory response in liver to
heat-killed Listeria monocytogenes and higher levels of Stat1 (600555)
and Stat4 proteins compared with wildtype mice. Tanaka et al. (2005)
concluded that SLIM regulates both the level of STAT protein expression
and the extent of STAT activation, and thus the amount of IFNG produced
following CD4-positive T-cell stimulation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Loughran et al. (2005) determined that the PDLIM2 gene contains 12 exons
and spans about 20 kb. The translation start codon is in exon 2.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Loughran et al. (2005) mapped the PDLIM2
gene to chromosome 8p21.2.

ANIMAL MODEL

Tanaka et al. (2005) found that Slim -/- mice were healthy and fertile.
Slim -/- mice showed enhanced Ifng production by Cd4-positive T cells,
enhanced inflammatory response in liver to heat-killed Listeria
monocytogenes, and higher levels of Stat proteins compared with wildtype
mice.

RECOMBINATION PROTEIN A; RECA;;

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

RAD51 has a critical role in the maintenance of genomic integrity by
functioning in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks. RAD51 mediates
homologous pairing and strand exchange in recombinatory structures known
as RAD51 foci in the nucleus (summary by Park et al., 2008).

CLONING

In Escherichia coli, the RecA protein searches for homologous regions
between 2 double-stranded DNA molecules and promotes strand exchange. It
is also involved in recombinational repair of double-strand breaks
(DSBs). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the protein encoded by rad51 is
required for repair of DSBs that occur in mitosis or meiosis. By
searching for orthologs of E. coli RecA, Shinohara et al. (1993) cloned
genes from human, mouse, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe (fission yeast)
that are homologous to rad51. Human and mouse RAD51 are identical
339-amino acid proteins and are highly homologous (83%) with the yeast
rad51 proteins. The mouse gene was transcribed at a high level in
thymus, spleen, testis, and ovary and at a lower level in brain.

By screening a testis cDNA library with a RAD51 probe, Park et al.
(2008) cloned a RAD51 splice variant lacking exon 9, which they called
RAD51-delta-ex9. The deduced 280-amino acid protein is identical to
full-length RAD51 for the first 259 amino acids, which includes an
N-terminal basic motif followed by the Walker A and B ATP-binding
motifs. The 2 proteins diverge at their C termini, but both C termini
contain basic motifs predicted to function as nuclear localization
signals. PCR analysis detected high expression of full-length RAD51 in
testis, with moderate expression detected in placenta, thymus, pancreas,
and colon, and weaker expression detected in lung, liver, skeletal
muscle, kidney, and ovary. RAD51-delta-ex9 was highly expressed in
testis, with much weaker expression only in skeletal muscle, pancreas,
thymus, and ovary. Western blot analysis of human testis detected RAD51
and RAD51-delta-ex9 at apparent molecular masses of 37 and 31 kD,
respectively. RAD51, but not RAD51-delta-ex9, was also detected at a
lower level in placenta, lung, and small intestine. Fluorescence-tagged
RAD51 and RAD51-delta-ex9 proteins both localized to the nucleus of
transfected COS-7 cells, with exclusion from nucleoli.

Using Western blot analysis, Sage et al. (2010) showed that a part of
the cytoplasmic pool of RAD51 in human cell lines fractionated with
mitochondria.

GENE FUNCTION

Solinger et al. (2002) showed that RAD54 (603615) protein dissociates
RAD51 from nucleoprotein filaments formed on double-stranded DNA
(dsDNA). Addition of RAD54 protein overcame inhibition of DNA strand
exchange by RAD51 protein bound to substrate dsDNA. Species preference
in the RAD51 dissociation and DNA strand exchange assays underlined the
importance of specific RAD54-RAD51 protein interactions. RAD51 protein
was unable to release dsDNA upon ATP hydrolysis, leaving it stuck on the
heteroduplex DNA product after DNA strand exchange. The authors
suggested that RAD54 protein is involved in the turnover of RAD51-dsDNA
filaments.

In S. cerevisiae, the Srs2 helicase negatively modulates recombination,
and later experiments have suggested that it reverses intermediate
recombination structures. Veaute et al. (2003) demonstrated that DNA
strand exchange mediated in vitro by RAD51 is inhibited by Srs2, and
that Srs2 disrupts RAD51 filaments formed on single-stranded DNA. Veaute
et al. (2003) concluded that their data provided an explanation for the
antirecombinogenic role of Srs2 in vivo and highlighted a theretofore
unknown mechanism for recombination control.

Krejci et al. (2003) clarified the role of Srs2 in recombination
modulation by purifying its encoded product and examining its
interactions with the RAD51 recombinase. Srs2 has a robust ATPase
activity that is dependent on single-stranded DNA and binds RAD51, but
the addition of a catalytic quantity of Srs2 to RAD51-mediated
recombination reactions causes severe inhibition of these reactions.
Krejci et al. (2003) showed that Srs2 acts by dislodging RAD51 from
single-stranded DNA. Thus, the attenuation of recombination efficiency
by Srs2 stems primarily from its ability to dismantle the RAD51
presynaptic filament efficiently. Krejci et al. (2003) suggested that
their findings have implications for the basis of Bloom (210900) and
Werner (277700) syndromes, which are caused by mutations in DNA
helicases and are characterized by increased frequencies of
recombination and a predisposition to cancers and accelerated aging.

Hussain et al. (2003) found that the FANCG protein (602956) colocalized
in nuclear foci with both BRCA2 (600185) and RAD51 following DNA damage
with mitomycin C. The authors concluded that BRCA2 is directly connected
to a pathway deficient in interstrand crosslink repair, and that at
least 1 other Fanconi anemia protein is closely associated with the
homologous recombination DNA repair machinery.

Dong et al. (2003) isolated a holoenzyme complex containing BRCA1
(113705), BRCA2, BARD1 (610593), and RAD51, which they called the BRCA1-
and BRCA2-containing complex (BRCC). The complex showed UBC5 (see
UBE2D1; 602961)-dependent ubiquitin E3 ligase activity. Inclusion of BRE
(610497) and BRCC3 (300617) enhanced ubiquitination by the complex, and
cancer-associated truncations in BRCA1 reduced the association of BRE
and BRCC3 with the complex. RNA interference of BRE and BRCC3 in HeLa
cells increased cell sensitivity to ionizing radiation and resulted in a
defect in G2/M checkpoint arrest. Dong et al. (2003) concluded that the
BRCC is a ubiquitin E3 ligase that enhances cellular survival following
DNA damage.

Yang et al. (2005) showed that a full-length Brca2 homolog (Brh2, from
the fungus Ustilago maydis) stimulates Rad51-mediated recombination at
substoichiometric concentrations relative to Rad51. Brh2 recruits Rad51
to DNA and facilitates the nucleation of the filament, which is then
elongated by the pool of free Rad51. Brh2 acts preferentially at a
junction between double-stranded DNA and single-stranded DNA, with
strict specificity for the 3-prime overhang polarity of a resected
double-stranded break. Yang et al. (2005) concluded that their results
established a BRCA2 function in RAD51-mediated double-stranded break
repair and explained the loss of this repair capacity in
BRCA2-associated cancers.

Enomoto et al. (2006) demonstrated that coexpression of human MND1
(611422) and HOP2 (608665) in E. coli resulted in the formation of
stable heterodimers that stimulated DMC1- and RAD51-mediated DNA strand
exchange. Chi et al. (2007) found that the Hop2 component of the mouse
recombinant Hop2-Mnd1 complex was the major DNA-binding subunit, and
that Mnd1 was the Rad51-interacting entity. Hop2-Mnd1 stabilized the
Rad51-single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) nucleoprotein filament, and enhanced
the ability of the Rad51-ssDNA nucleoprotein filament to capture duplex
DNA, which is an obligatory step in the formation of the synaptic
complex critical for DNA joint formation.

By combining optical tweezers with single-molecule fluorescence
microscopy and microfluidics, van Mameren et al. (2009) demonstrated
that disassembly of human RAD51 nucleoprotein filaments results from the
interplay between ATP hydrolysis and the release of the tension stored
in the filament. By applying external tension to the DNA, they found
that disassembly slows down and can even be stalled. The authors
quantified the fluorescence of RAD51 patches and found that disassembly
occurs in bursts interspersed by long pauses. After relaxation of a
stalled complex, pauses were suppressed resulting in a large burst. Van
Mameren et al. (2009) concluded that tension-dependent disassembly takes
place only from filament ends, after tension-independent ATP hydrolysis.

Using purified recombinant proteins, Tombline and Fishel (2002) showed
that human RAD51 had a 50-fold reduction in catalytic efficiency
compared to bacterial RecA and lacked the magnitude of ATP-induced
cooperativity that is a hallmark of RecA. Altering the ratio of
DNA/RAD51 and including salts that stimulate DNA strand exchange, such
as ammonium sulfate, were found to increase RAD51 catalytic efficiency.
RAD51 and RecA differed in the ability of ssDNA and dsDNA to induce
their ATPase activity and also showed differences in DNA site size.
RAD51 had a minimal site size of 3 nucleotides, but 6 to 8 nucleotides
of ssDNA per RAD51 monomer provoked optimal ATPase efficiency, whereas
RecA has a site size of 3 nucleotides for ssDNA.

Park et al. (2008) showed that RAD51-delta-ex9 showed approximately the
same DNA strand exchange activity as full-length RAD51 in vitro,
although it had significantly higher activity than RAD51 in homologous
DNA repair. Mutation analysis revealed that the unique C termini of
RAD51 and RAD51-delta-ex9 independently directed their nuclear
localization in transfected COS-7 cells.

Using Western blot analysis, Sage et al. (2010) found that mitochondrial
levels of RAD51, RAD51C, and XRCC3 in human cell lines increased in
response to oxidative stress and weak ionizing radiation.
Immunoprecipitation analysis showed that oxidative stress increased the
interaction of RAD51 with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), and knockdown of
RAD51, via small interfering RNA, increased mtDNA copy number,
apparently due to general inhibition of cell cycle progression.
Oxidative stress normally increases mtDNA copy number; however,
knockdown of RAD51, RAD51C, or XRCC3 suppressed this stress response and
resulted in decreased mtDNA copy number. Sage et al. (2010) concluded
that proteins of the homologous recombination pathway are required to
maintain the mitochondrial genome.

Jensen et al. (2010) reported the purification of BRCA2 and showed that
it both binds RAD51 and potentiates recombinational DNA repair by
promoting assembly of RAD51 onto ssDNA. BRCA2 acts by targeting RAD51 to
ssDNA over dsDNA, enabling RAD51 to displace replication protein-A (RPA;
179835) from ssDNA and stabilizing RAD51 ssDNA filaments by blocking ATP
hydrolysis. BRCA2 does not anneal ssDNA complexed with RPA, implying it
does not directly function in repair processes that involve ssDNA
annealing. The findings of Jensen et al. (2010) showed that BRCA2 is a
key mediator of homologous recombination and provided a molecular basis
for understanding how this DNA repair process is disrupted by BRCA2
mutations.

For additional information on RAD51 and the BRCC protein complex that
performs DNA repair and recombination, see BRCA2 (600185).

Jirawatnotai et al. (2011) performed a series of proteomic screens for
cyclin D1 (168461) protein partners in several types of human tumors and
found that cyclin D1 directly binds RAD51 and that cyclin D1-RAD51
interaction is induced by radiation. Like RAD51, cyclin D1 is recruited
to DNA damage sites in a BRCA2-dependent fashion. Reduction of cyclin D1
levels in human cancer cells impaired recruitment of RAD51 to damaged
DNA, impeded the homologous recombination-mediated DNA repair, and
increased sensitivity of cells to radiation in vitro and in vivo. This
effect was seen in cancer cells lacking the retinoblastoma protein
(614041), which do not require D-cyclins for proliferation. Jirawatnotai
et al. (2011) concluded that their findings revealed an unexpected
function of a core cell-cycle protein in DNA repair and suggested that
targeting cyclin D1 may be beneficial also in retinoblastoma-negative
cancers, which were thought to be unaffected by cyclin D1 inhibition.

Long et al. (2011) reported that the broken sister chromatid generated
by a DNA double-strand break in Xenopus extracts is repaired via
RAD51-dependent strand invasion into the regenerated sister.
Recombination acts downstream of FANCI (611360)-FANCD2 (613984), yet
RAD51 binds interstrand crosslinks-stalled replication forks
independently of FANCI and FANC2 and before double-strand break
formation. Long et al. (2011) concluded that their results elucidated
the functional link between the Fanconi anemia pathway and the
recombination machinery during interstrand crosslink repair. In
addition, their results demonstrated the complete repair of a
double-strand break via homologous recombination in vitro.

In the developing mouse cortex, Depienne et al. (2012) found that
expression of the Rad51 gene was highest at embryonic day 12 (E12), and
was mostly detected in the cortical ventricular proliferative zone. The
Dcc gene (120470) was also expressed at this time, but in a different
location in the preplate postmitotic zone. In the cortex of newborn
mice, Rad51 was mainly present in the subplate and, in lesser amounts,
in layer V, whereas Dcc was selectively located in axons innervating the
cortex. Rad51 was also detected in a subpopulation of corticospinal
axons at the pyramidal decussation in 2-day-old mice. The subcellular
location of Rad51 also changes with development: at E12, it was mostly
detected in the nucleus of progenitor cells, whereas after birth, it was
mainly localized in the cell soma. The results suggested that Rrad51
could have several functions related to different cellular
localizations.

With use of a separation-of-function mutant form of Rad51 that retains
filament-forming but not joint molecule (JM)-forming activity in S.
cerevisiae,, Cloud et al. (2012) showed that the JM activity of Rad51 is
fully dispensable for meiotic recombination. The corresponding mutation
in Dmc1 (602721) causes a profound recombination defect, demonstrating
that Dmc1's JM activity alone is responsible for meiotic recombination.
Cloud et al. (2012) further provided biochemical evidence that Rad51
acts with Mei5-Sae3 as a Dmc1 accessory factor. Thus, Rad51 is a
multifunctional protein that catalyzes recombination directly in mitosis
and indirectly, via Dmc1, during meiosis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Park et al. (2008) determined that the RAD51 gene contains 10 exons.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Slupianek et al. (2001) demonstrated that RAD51 is important for
resistance to cisplatin and mitomycin C in cells expressing the BCR
(151410)/ABL (189980) oncogenic tyrosine kinase. BCR/ABL significantly
enhanced the expression of RAD51 and several RAD51 paralogs. RAD51
overexpression was mediated by STAT5 (601511)-dependent transcription as
well as by inhibition of caspase-3 (600636)-dependent cleavage.
Phosphorylation of the RAD51 tyr315 residue by BCR/ABL appeared
essential for enhanced DSB repair and drug resistance.

- Crystal Structure

Pellegrini et al. (2002) reported the 1.7-angstrom crystal structure of
a complex between the BRC repeat, which is an evolutionarily conserved
sequence in BRCA2, and the RecA-homology domain of RAD51. The BRC repeat
mimics a motif in RAD51 that serves as an interface for oligomerization
between individual RAD51 monomers, thus enabling BRCA2 to control the
assembly of the RAD51 nucleoprotein filament, which is essential for
strand-pairing reactions during DNA recombination. The RAD51
oligomerization motif is highly conserved among RecA-like recombinases,
highlighting a common evolutionarily origin for the mechanism of
nucleoprotein filament formation, mirrored in the BRC repeat. Pellegrini
et al. (2002) showed that cancer-associated mutations that affect the
BRC repeat disrupt its predicted interaction with RAD51, yielding
structural insight into mechanisms for cancer susceptibility.

Chen et al. (2008) solved the crystal structures of the E. coli
RecA-ssDNA and RecA heteroduplex filaments. They showed that ssDNA and
ATP bind to RecA-RecA interfaces cooperatively, explaining the ATP
dependency of DNA binding. The ATP gamma-phosphate is sensed across the
RecA-RecA interface by 2 lysine residues that also stimulate ATP
hydrolysis, providing a mechanism for DNA release. The DNA is underwound
and stretched globally, but locally it adopts a B-DNA-like conformation
that restricts the homology search to Watson-Crick-type basepairing. The
complementary strand interacts primarily through basepairing, making
heteroduplex formation strictly dependent on complementarity. The
underwound, stretched filament conformation probably evolved to
destabilize the donor duplex, freeing the complementary strand for
homology sampling.

MAPPING

Shinohara et al. (1993) mapped the RAD51 gene to chromosome 15 by
analysis of a somatic cell hybrid panel and localized the mouse gene to
chromosome 2F1 by fluorescence in situ hybridization.

By FISH analysis, Takahashi et al. (1994) assigned the RAD51 gene to
chromosome 15q15.1 and the mouse gene to chromosome 2F1.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Susceptibility to Breast Cancer

RAD51, a homolog of RecA of E. coli, functions in recombination and in
DNA repair. The BRCA1 and BRCA2 proteins, implicated in familial breast
cancer, form a complex with RAD51, and these genes are thought to
participate in a common DNA damage response pathway associated with the
activation of homologous recombination and DSB repair. To investigate
the possibility that the RAD51 gene may be involved in the development
of hereditary breast cancer, Kato et al. (2000) screened Japanese
patients with hereditary breast cancer for RAD51 mutations and found a
single alteration in exon 6 (179617.0001). This was determined to be
present in the germline in 2 patients with bilateral breast cancer.

- Susceptibility to Mirror Movements 2

By exome sequencing of a large French family with congenital mirror
movements-2 (MRMV2; 614508) originally reported by Depienne et al.
(2011), Depienne et al. (2012) identified a heterozygous truncating
mutation in the RAD51 gene (179617.0003). The mutation was found in 8
affected individuals and in 8 unaffected individuals, indicating
significant incomplete penetrance (50%). A second truncating mutation in
the RAD51 gene (179617.0004) was identified in a German family with the
disorder. The authors concluded that haploinsufficiency was the
pathogenic mechanism. The mechanism linking RAD1 deficiency to the
disorder was unclear: insufficient RAD51-related DNA repair during early
corticogenesis might lead to excessive apoptosis and altered central
nervous system development; however, the authors noted that RAD51 may
have a direct or indirect role in axonal guidance.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using targeted gene mutation in embryonic stem (ES) cells, Tsuzuki et
al. (1996) introduced a small deletion into an essential region of the
mouse Rad51 gene and transmitted the mutation through mouse germ-cell
lines. Mice heterozygous for the mutation were viable and fertile. The
authors identified no Rad51 -/- pups among 148 neonates examined.
However, a few Rad51 -/- embryos were identified when examined during
the early stages of embryonic development. No Rad51 -/- ES cells were
detected under selective growth conditions. Tsuzuki et al. (1996)
concluded that the Rad51 protein plays an essential role in the
proliferation of cells and that a basic molecular defect present in the
Rad51 -/- embryos interferes with cell viability, leading to
pre-implantation lethality. The homozygous Rad51 null mutation can be
characterized as a preimplantational lethal mutation that disrupts basic
molecular functions of cells.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
BREAST CANCER, FAMILIAL
RAD51, ARG150GLN

In studies of 20 patients from breast cancer (114480) families and 25
patients with breast cancer that was early-onset, bilateral, or
accompanied by a history of primary cancer(s) of other organs, Kato et
al. (2000) found a missense mutation in 2 patients with familial breast
cancer: a G-to-A transition converting codon 150 from CGG (arg) to CAG
(gln). Both patients had bilateral breast cancer, one with synchronous
bilateral breast cancer and the other with synchronous bilateral
multiple breast cancer. The patients were presumed to be unrelated.

.0002
BREAST CANCER, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, IN BRCA1 AND BRCA2 CARRIERS
RAD51, 135G-C

Wang et al. (1999) presented evidence that a single nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) in the 5-prime untranslated region of RAD51 is
associated with increased breast cancer risk in BRCA1 (113705) and BRCA2
(600185) carriers but does not influence breast cancer risk in women who
are not BRCA1 or BRCA2 carriers. This SNP, designated 135g/c, is a
substitution of C for G at position 135 in the RAD51 cDNA. Levy-Lahad et
al. (2001) studied 257 female Ashkenazi Jewish carriers of one of the
common BRCA1 (185delAG; 113705.0003, or 5382insC; 113705.0018) or BRCA2
(6174delT; 600185.0009) mutations. They found that the 135 SNP modified
cancer risk in BRCA2 carriers but not in BRCA1 carriers. Survival
analysis in BRCA2 carriers showed that 135C increased risk of breast
and/or ovarian cancer with a hazard ratio (HR) of 4.0. This effect was
largely due to increased breast cancer risk with an HR of 3.46 for
breast cancer in BRCA2 carriers who were 135C heterozygotes. RAD51
status did not affect ovarian cancer risk.

Antoniou et al. (2007) pooled genotype data for 8,512 female carriers
from 19 studies for the RAD51 135G-C SNP. They found evidence of an
increased breast cancer risk in CC homozygotes (hazard ratio 1.92; 95%
confidence interval 1.25-2.94) but not in heterozygotes. When BRCA1 and
BRCA2 mutation carriers were analyzed separately, the increased risk was
statistically significant only among BRCA2 mutation carriers, in whom
they observed hazard ratios of 1.17 (95% confidence interval 0.91-1.51)
among heterozygotes and 3.18 (95% confidence interval 1.39-7.27) among
rare homozygotes. In addition, they determined that the 135G-C variant
affects RAD51 splicing within the 5-prime untranslated region. Thus,
135G-C may modify the risk of breast cancer in BRCA2 mutation carriers
by altering the expression of RAD51. Antoniou et al. (2007) stated that
RAD51 was the first gene to be reliably identified as a modifier of risk
among BRCA1/2 mutation carriers.

.0003
MIRROR MOVEMENTS 2, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
RAD51, ARG254TER

In 8 affected members of a large 4-generation French family with
congenital mirror movements-2 (MRMV2; 614508) (Depienne et al., 2011),
Depienne et al. (2012) identified a heterozygous 760C-T transition in
exon 8 of the RAD51 gene, resulting in an arg254-to-ter (R254X)
substitution. The mutation was not found in 644 controls, but it was
found in 8 unaffected family members, indicating striking incomplete
penetrance (50%). The mutation was found by exome sequencing. RAD51 mRNA
was significantly downregulated due to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay,
indicating haploinsufficiency as the pathogenic mechanism.

.0004
MIRROR MOVEMENTS 2
RAD51, 1-BP DUP, 855A

In a German mother and son with congenital mirror movements-2 (MRMV2;
614508) (Depienne et al., 2011), Depienne et al. (2012) identified a
heterozygous 1-bp duplication (855dupA) in exon 9 of the RAD51 gene,
resulting in a frameshift and premature termination. The mutation was
not found in 644 controls.

600169	TITLE *600169 MAJOR HISTOCOMPATIBILITY COMPLEX CLASS I CHAIN-RELATED GENE A; MICA
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I genes typically encode
polymorphic peptide-binding chains that are ubiquitously expressed and
mediate the recognition of intracellular antigens by cytotoxic T cells.
Motivated by the association of HLA-B27 with rheumatoid and inflammatory
diseases, Bahram et al. (1994) found a family of sequences in the human
MHC that are highly divergent from all of the known MHC class I genes
and were presumably derived early in the evolution of mammalian class I
genes. These MIC genes (for MHC class I chain-related genes) evolved in
parallel with the human class I genes and with those of most, if not
all, mammalian orders. Bahram et al. (1994) cloned the MICA gene in this
family and stated that it was by far the most divergent mammalian MHC
class I gene known. The MICA gene encodes a 383-amino acid polypeptide
with a predicted mass of 43 kD. It is further distinguished by its
unusual exon-intron organization and preferential expression in
fibroblasts and epithelial cells. However, the presence of distinctive
residues in the MICA amino acid sequence translated from cDNA suggested
that the putative MICA chain folds similarly to typical class I chains
and may have the capacity to bind peptide or other short ligands. Thus,
a second lineage of evolutionarily conserved MHC class I genes was
defined by these results. MICA and other members of this family may have
been selected for specialized functions that are either ancient or
derived from those of typical MHC class I genes, in analogy to some of
the nonclassic mouse H-2 genes.

MAPPING

Bahram et al. (1994) demonstrated that the MICA gene is located near
HLA-B (142830) on chromosome 6. Nalabolu et al. (1996) showed that the
MICA and MICB (602436) genes occur in a 200-kb region spanning the TNFA
(191160) and TNFB (153440) cluster at chromosome 6p21.3.

GENE FUNCTION

T cells with variable region V-delta-1 gamma/delta T-cell receptors (see
TCRG, 186970, and TCRD, 186810) are distributed throughout the human
intestinal epithelium and may function as sentinels that respond to self
antigens. The expression of MICA matches this localization. Groh et al.
(1998) found that MICA and the closely related MICB were recognized by
intestinal epithelial T cells expressing diverse V-delta-1 gamma/delta
TCRs. These interactions involved the alpha-1/alpha-2 domains of MICA
and MICB but were independent of antigen processing. With intestinal
epithelial cell lines, the expression and recognition of MICA and MICB
could be stress induced. Thus, these molecules may broadly regulate
protective responses by the V-delta-1 gamma/delta T cells in the
epithelium of the intestinal tract.

Bauer et al. (1999) found that MICA binds NKG2D (KLRK1; 611817) on
gamma/delta T cells, CD8+ alpha/beta T cells, and natural killer (NK)
cells. Engagement of NKG2D activated cytolytic responses of gamma/delta
T cells and NK cells against transfectants and epithelial tumor cells
expressing MICA. These results defined an activating immunoreceptor-MHC
ligand interaction that may promote antitumor NK- and T-cell responses.

MIC engagement of NKG2D stimulates NK-cell and T-cell effector
functions. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection induces the expression of
stress proteins such as HSP70 (140550). By flow cytometric analysis,
Groh et al. (2001) showed that CMV infection also induces MIC expression
and a concurrent downregulation of MHC class I molecules on fibroblasts
and endothelial cells. Immunohistochemical analysis of lung sections
from patients with CMV interstitial pneumonitis confirmed that induction
of MIC expression also occurs in vivo. Functional analysis of T-cell
cytotoxicity against CMV-infected fibroblasts showed that early after
infection when MIC expression was low, antibodies to MHC class I, but
not to MIC or NKG2D, could block T cell-mediated cytolysis. As MIC
expression increased, antibody masking of MIC or NKG2D reduced target
cell lysis; anti-MHC class I antibodies further reduced cytolysis. The
presence of MICA on stimulator cells also substantially enhanced
cytokine release by T-cell clones, and anti-MIC antibody abrogated this
production, suggesting that the MIC-NKG2D interaction provides an
important costimulatory activity.

Groh et al. (2002) showed that NKG2D binding of MIC induces endocytosis
and degradation of NKG2D. In cancer patients, NKG2D expression was
markedly reduced in both CD8+ tumor-infiltrating T cells and in
peripheral blood T cells, associated with circulating tumor-derived
soluble MICA. The downregulation of NKG2D causes a severe impairment of
tumor antigen-specific effector T cells. Groh et al. (2002) proposed
that this mode of T cell silencing through MIC shedding may promote
tumor immune evasion and inferred that it could also compromise host
resistance to infections.

Using immunohistopathologic and flow cytometric analyses, Hue et al.
(2004) found increased expression of MICA at epithelial cell surfaces in
celiac disease (CD; 212750) patients exposed to gliadin. Patient biopsy
specimens exposed to an IL15 (600554)-inducing gliadin fragment did not
express MICA in the presence of anti-IL15. Cytotoxicity assays showed
that NKG2D played primarily a costimulatory role on intraepithelial
lymphocytes (IELs), with a TCR-mediated signal required for complete
activation. However, in refractory celiac sprue patients, NKG2D mediated
a direct activating signal. ELISA detected soluble MICA in serum in half
of untreated CD patients, but in few patients on gluten-free diets; the
presence of soluble MICA was independent of MICA genotype. Hue et al.
(2004) proposed that villous atrophy in CD may be ascribed to
IEL-mediated damage to enterocytes involving NKG2D-MICA interaction
after gliadin-induced expression of MICA on gut epithelium.

Kriegeskorte et al. (2005) showed that the NKG2D ligands H60 and MICA
could mediate strong suppressive effects on T-cell proliferation. The
suppression did not occur in Il10 (124092)-deficient mice and involved a
receptor other than NKG2D. Kriegeskorte et al. (2005) concluded that
NKG2D ligands can induce strong inhibitory effects in addition to
stimulatory effects

Kaiser et al. (2007) showed that on the surface of tumor cells, MICA
associates with endoplasmic reticulum protein-5 (ERP5; 611099), which,
similar to protein disulfide isomerase (176790), usually assists in the
folding of nascent proteins inside cells. Pharmacologic inhibition of
thioreductase activity and ERP5 gene silencing revealed that
cell-surface ERP5 function is required for MICA shedding. ERP5 and
membrane-anchored MICA formed transitory mixed disulfide complexes from
which soluble MICA was released after proteolytic cleavage near the cell
membrane. Kaiser et al. (2007) suggested that reduction of the seemingly
inaccessible disulfide bond in the membrane-proximal alpha-3 domain of
MICA must involve a large conformational change that enables proteolytic
cleavage. They concluded that their results uncovered a molecular
mechanism whereby domain-specific deconstruction regulates MICA protein
shedding, thereby promoting tumor immune evasion, and identified surface
ERP5 as a strategic target for therapeutic intervention.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Using multiwavelength-anomalous dispersion phases at a resolution of 2.7
angstroms, Li et al. (2001) determined the crystal structure of MICA and
NKG2D. They showed that NKG2D forms a homodimer that interacts with a
MICA monomer.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

The predicted amino acid sequence of the MICA chain suggests that it
folds similarly to typical class I chains and may have the capacity to
bind peptides or other short ligands (Bahram et al., 1994). Therefore,
MICA was predicted to have a specialized function in antigen
presentation or T cell recognition. During nucleotide sequence analyses
of the MICA genomic clone, Mizuki et al. (1997) found a triplet repeat
microsatellite polymorphism (GCT/AGC)n in the transmembrane region of
the MICA gene. In 68 HLA homozygous B cell lines, 5 distinct alleles of
this microsatellite sequence were detected. One of them contained an
additional 1-bp insertion that created a frameshift resulting in a
premature termination codon in the transmembrane region. This particular
allele was thought to encode a soluble, secreted form of the MICA
molecule. Mizuki et al. (1997) also investigated this microsatellite
polymorphism in 77 Japanese patients with Behcet disease (109650), which
had previously been known to be associated with HLA-B51. The
microsatellite allele consisting of 6 repetitions of GCT/AGC was present
at significantly higher frequency in the patient population (Pc =
0.00055) than in a control population. Furthermore, the (GCT/AGC)6
allele was present in all B51 positive patients and in an additional 13
B51 negative patients. These results suggested the possibility of a
primary association of Behcet disease with MICA rather than HLA-B.

Wallace et al. (1999) investigated the association of the 16 previously
described external domain alleles and the transmembrane triplet repeats
of the MICA gene with Behcet disease in a Middle Eastern population. The
results showed an increase of MICA*009 in the Behcet disease patient
group (44 of 95; 46%) compared with controls (24 of 102; 24%), giving an
odds ratio (OR) of 2.8. The A6 form of a MICA transmembrane triplet
repeat was found to be significantly raised in the patients (80 of 95;
84%) compared with controls (58 of 102; 57%), giving an OR of 4. The
most significant association was that between Behcet disease and
HLA-B51. Wallace et al. (1999) interpreted the data as indicating that
since both MICA*009 and A6 are in strong linkage disequilibrium with
HLA-B51, they are unlikely to be the susceptibility genes for Behcet
disease but may be markers for additional risk factors.

Mizuki et al. (2000) studied the localization of the pathogenic gene of
Behcet disease using microsatellite analysis of 3 different populations:
Japanese, Greek, and Italian. In genotypic differentiation between
patients and controls, the authors found that only HLA-B51 was
significantly associated with BD in all 3 populations. These results
suggested that the pathogenic gene of BD is HLA-B51 itself and not other
genes located in the vicinity of HLA-B.

The MICA and MICB genes are polymorphic, displaying an unusual
distribution of a number of variant amino acids in their extracellular
alpha-1, alpha-2, and alpha-3 domains. To further define the
polymorphism of MICA, Petersdorf et al. (1999) examined its alleles
among 275 individuals with common and rare HLA genotypes. Of 16
previously defined alleles, 12 were confirmed, and 5 new alleles were
identified. A 2-by-2 analysis of MICA and HLA-B alleles uncovered a
number of significant associations. These results confirmed and extended
previous knowledge on the polymorphism of MICA. Petersdorf et al. (1999)
suggested that a strong positive linkage of certain MICA and HLA-B
alleles may have implications for studies related to MHC-associated
diseases and transplantation.

Komatsu-Wakui et al. (1999) studied polymorphisms in the MICA gene in
Japanese. They observed 8 MICA alleles in Japanese individuals, among
which 1, tentatively named MIC-AMW, had not previously been reported.
There was a strong linkage disequilibrium between MICA and HLA-B loci;
each MICA allele showed strong association with a particular HLA-B
group. Komatsu-Wakui et al. (1999) also identified a MICA-MICB null
haplotype, which was associated with HLAB*4801. In this haplotype, they
found large-scale deletion (of approximately 100 kb), including the
entire MICA gene, and a MICB gene that possessed a stop codon.

To summarize, the MICA gene has a microsatellite repeat, GCT(n), within
exon 5, encoding for a variable number of alanines (Ala = A).
Perez-Rodriguez et al. (2000) described a novel MICA allele with 10 GCT
repeats (A10); 4 different repeats of this microsatellite had been
previously reported: A4, A5, A6, and A9. An association of Behcet
disease with the A9 repeat had been reported by Mizuki et al. (1997).

Gambelunghe et al. (2001) concluded the existence of distinct genetic
markers for childhood/young-onset IDDM (222100) and for adult-onset
IDDM, namely the MICA5 and MICA5.1 alleles, respectively.

Mei et al. (2009) analyzed the relationship between Chlamydia
trachomatis, tubal pathology, and MICA allele polymorphisms in 214
infertile Chinese women. They found no association between MICA alleles
and the presence or absence of tubal pathology in infertile women with
antibodies to C. trachomatis. However, an association was found between
the MICA*008 allele and infertile women without antibodies to C.
trachomatis. Mei et al. (2009) concluded that MICA may modify host
susceptibility to C. trachomatis infection.

Aquino-Galvez et al. (2009) analyzed the MICA gene in 80 sporadic
patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF; 178500) and 201
controls and found a significant increase of MICA*001 allele in the IPF
cohort (odds ratio, 2.91; corrected p = 0.03). In addition, the MICA
*001/*00201 genotype was significantly increased in patients with IPF
compared with healthy controls (odds ratio, 4.72; corrected p = 0.01).
Strong immunoreactive MICA staining was localized in alveolar epithelial
cells and fibroblasts from IPF lungs, whereas control lungs were
negative. Soluble MICA was detected in 35% of IPF patients compared to
12% of control subjects (p = 0.0007). The expression of the MICA
receptor NKG2D (KLRK1; 611817) was significantly decreased in
gamma/delta T cells and natural killer cells obtained from IPF lungs.
Aquino-Galvez et al. (2009) concluded that MICA polymorphisms and
abnormal expression of NKG2D might contribute to IPF susceptibility.

region and progression from chronic hepatitis C to hepatocellular
carcinoma, see 114550.

ANIMAL MODEL

The MICA/MICB locus is not conserved in mice; however, mice do have
counterpart NKG2D ligands, Rae1-beta and H60. Diefenbach et al. (2001)
demonstrated that ectopic expression of these ligands in tumor cell
lines resulted not only in potent rejection mediated by either NK cells
or CD8-positive T cells, but that mice subsequently challenged with
tumor cell lines not expressing the ligands were also immune to the
tumors. Girardi et al. (2001) determined that immunity to cutaneous
malignancies could be mediated by NKG2D-expressing intraepithelial
gamma/delta T cells. Girardi et al. (2001) proposed that the diverse
expression of NKG2D on cytolytic cell types may allow attacks on tumor
cells in different anatomical compartments and that gamma/delta T cells
may be particularly important in skin and gut.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Peroxisomal beta-oxidation of fatty acids is catalyzed by enzymes that
are immunologically distinct from the analogous mitochondrial enzymes.
The ACOX1 gene encodes peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase (EC 1.3.3.6), the
first and rate-limiting enzyme in the peroxisomal fatty acid
beta-oxidation pathway. Hydrogen peroxide is a byproduct of acyl-CoA
oxidase activity (Fournier et al., 1994; Li et al., 2000).

See also ACOX2 (601641), which encodes the branched-chain peroxisomal
acyl-CoA oxidase, and ACOX3 (603402), which encodes the pristanoyl
peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase.

CLONING

Fournier et al. (1994) isolated cDNA clones encoding human peroxisomal
acyl-CoA oxidase from a human liver cDNA library. The deduced human
protein sequence is 89% similar to the rat protein. Like the rat
homolog, the human sequence also contains C-terminal ser-lys-leu (SKL)
residues which function as a peroxisomal targeting signal. Two mRNA
species, 1.9-kb and 2.1-kb, were identified in liver.

Aoyama et al. (1994) also cloned human acyl-CoA oxidase, which they
referred to as AOX. The 661-amino acid protein showed functional
expression in cultured human skin fibroblasts.

Nohammer et al. (2000) cloned mouse acyl-CoA oxidase, which encodes a
661-amino acid protein that contains the SKL motif. The mouse protein
shares 96% and 87% sequence homology with the rat and human proteins,
respectively. Protein and mRNA expression were highest in liver,
followed by kidney, brain, and adipose tissue. During mouse brain
development, acyl-CoA oxidase mRNA expression was highest during the
suckling period, indicating that peroxisomal beta-oxidation is critical
during this developmental stage.

Ferdinandusse et al. (2007) characterized the 2 ACOX isoforms, which
include either exon 3I or 3II, respectively, in yeast studies. The 3I
isoform showed highest activity with C10-CoA, and the activity decreased
with increasing chain length. In comparison, the exon 3II isoform was
active with a much broader range of substrates and showed activity
toward very long-chain acyl-CoAs. Human fibroblast studies showed that
both isoforms are expressed in equal amounts.

GENE STRUCTURE

Varanasi et al. (1994) demonstrated that the ACOX gene spans
approximately 33 kb and contains 14 exons. Primer-extension analysis
revealed 3 principal cap sites, which were mapped at 50, 52, and 53
nucleotides upstream of the initiator methionine codon. There are 2
different forms of exon 3, 3I and 3II, used in alternative splicing.

MAPPING

By in situ hybridization with use of a biotin labeled probe, Varanasi et
al. (1994) mapped the ACOX gene to chromosome 17q25. By PCR analysis of
human/rodent hybrid DNAs, Moghrabi et al. (1995) mapped the gene to
17q23-qter. They referred to the enzyme as 'peroxisomal palmitoyl-CoA
oxidase.'

GENE FUNCTION

Peroxisomal beta-oxidation of fatty acids, originally described by
Lazarow and de Duve (1976), is catalyzed by 3 enzymes: acyl-CoA oxidase,
the D-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratase/D-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase
bifunctional protein, also called D-bifunctional protein (HSD17B4;
601860), and 3-oxoacyl-CoA thiolase (ACAA1; 604054) (Fournier et al.,
1994).

Reddy and Rao (1986) concluded that the marked induction of acyl-CoA
oxidase, a hydrogen peroxide-producing enzyme in the liver of rats and
mice, contributed to oxidative DNA damage and hepatocarcinogenesis
resulting from exposure to peroxisome proliferators.

Li et al. (2000) showed that transient overexpression of rat ACOX1 in
COS-1 cells, in the presence of a hydrogen peroxide-generating
substrate, resulted in the activation of the transcription factor
NF-kappa-beta (NFKB1; 164011). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays
showed that ACOX1 expression increased NFKB1 DNA-binding activity in a
dose-dependent manner. The activation could be blocked by catalase (CAT;
115500) overexpression and by the antioxidant vitamin E. The findings
indicated that ACOX1 mediates, at least in part, peroxisome
proliferator-induced NFKB activation.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 2 sibs with acyl-CoA oxidase deficiency (264470) previously reported
by Poll-The et al. (1988), Fournier et al. (1994) identified an
approximately 17-kb deletion in the ACOX1 gene (609751.0001).

In Japanese patients with acyl-CoA oxidase deficiency, Suzuki et al.
(2002) identified homozygous mutations in the ACOX1 gene (609751.0002;
609751.0003).

Ferdinandusse et al. (2007) identified 20 different mutations in the
ACOX1 gene (see, e.g., 609751.0004; 609751.0005) in 22 patients with
acyl-CoA oxidase deficiency. One patient, who was clinically and
biochemically indistinguishable from the others, had a deletion in exon
3II of the ACOX1 gene (609751.0006).

ANIMAL MODEL

Fan et al. (1996) found that homozygous Acox1-null mice were viable, but
growth-retarded and infertile. Using Northern blots, immunoblots, and
enzyme assays, they determined that the livers of Acox1-null mice
completely lacked Acox1 mRNA and protein. Histologic observations showed
that 1- to 2-month-old mutant mice had severe microvesicular fatty
metamorphosis of hepatocytes, with few or no liver peroxisomes. By 5
months of age, there was proliferation of hepatocytes, with newly
emerging hepatocytes being devoid of lipid droplets. In 6- to
7-month-old mutant mice, the number of fatty hepatocytes decreased and
were replaced by regenerating cells with granular cytoplasm. Peroxisomes
were observed in the kidneys of these mice, though these peroxisomes
lacked Acox1 activity. The findings suggested a link between peroxisomal
beta-oxidation, peroxisome assembly, cell death, and cell proliferation
in the liver.

In liver tissue of Acox1-null mice, Infante et al. (2002) found a
dramatic increase in extremely long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids
compared to heterozygous and wildtype mice. Detailed biochemical
analysis suggested that the extremely long-chain fatty acids were
natural runaway elongation byproducts of fatty acids that are normally
disposed of by peroxisomal beta-oxidation. The findings confirmed that
Acox1 is required for beta-oxidation of long-chain fatty acids.

608242	TITLE *608242 HECT DOMAIN AND RCC1-LIKE DOMAIN 5; HERC5
;;CYCLIN E-BINDING PROTEIN 1; CEB1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

HERC5 belongs to the HERC family of ubiquitin ligases, all of which
contain a HECT domain and at least 1 RCC1 (179710)-like domain (RLD).
The 350-amino acid HECT domain is predicted to catalyze the formation of
a thioester with ubiquitin before transferring it to a substrate, and
the RLD is predicted to act as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for
small G proteins (Hochrainer et al., 2005).

CLONING

By a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a human B-cell cDNA library with both
cyclin E (123837) and its cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p21
(300237) as bait, Mitsui et al. (1999) identified a novel cDNA, which
they designated CEB1, encoding a deduced 1,024-amino acid protein
containing a HECT domain at its C terminus and an RLD consisting of 7
repetitive sequences at its N terminus. Immunofluorescence studies
indicated primarily cytoplasmic but some perinuclear localization of the
protein. Northern blot analysis detected expression of CEB1 specifically
in testis and to a lesser degree in ovary; low or no expression was
detected in human diploid lung fibroblasts or in tumor lines possessing
the functional tumor suppressors p53 (191170) or RB1 (614041).

Using RT-PCR, Hochrainer et al. (2005) detected highest HERC5 expression
in testis, followed by fetal brain. Expression was lower in placenta,
heart, and adult brain. Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy of
transiently transfected HeLa cells showed HERC5 in a punctate
cytoplasmic distribution.

GENE FUNCTION

Using coexpression studies in HEK293 cells, Mitsui et al. (1999)
demonstrated that cyclin E, as well as other cyclins tested,
specifically interacted with CEB1 even in the absence of p21. CDK
inhibitors, however, including p21 and p27 (600778), showed either weak
or no interaction with CEB1. Mitsui et al. (1999) identified at least 2
cyclin-binding sites within amino acids 499-925 of CEB1.

By several experimental approaches, Mitsui et al. (1999) found that the
expression of CEB1 appeared to be regulated by RB1 and p53. The authors
speculated that CEB1 regulates or mediates the activity of CDKs because
CEB1 was highly induced when both RB1 and p53 were inactivated, with
subsequent elevation of CDK activity.

Wong et al. (2006) expressed labeled ISG15 (147571) in a lung cell line
and identified proteins conjugated by ISG15 after IFNB (147640)
treatment, including HERC5. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis
confirmed that HERC5 specifically copurified with ISG15. RT-PCR analysis
detected upregulated HERC5 expression after IFNB treatment. Suppression
of HERC5 using small interfering RNA showed that HERC5 was required for
the ISG15 conjugation system (ISGylation) following IFNB treatment.
Overexpression of HERC5 in combination with UBE1L (191325) and UBCH8
(UBE2L6; 603890) allowed ISGylation in the absence of IFNB induction.
Mutation analysis showed that cys994 within the HECT domain of HERC5 was
essential for HERC5 E3 protein ligase activity in ISGylation. Wong et
al. (2006) concluded that HERC5 acts as an ISG15 protein ligase after
type I IFN stimulation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hochrainer et al. (2005) determined that the HERC5 gene contains 23
exons, with the initiation codon in exon 1.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Mitsui et al. (1999) mapped the
CEB1 gene to chromosome 4q22.2-q22.3.

Using somatic cell hybridization, Hochrainer et al. (2005) mapped the
HERC5 gene to chromosome 4. By genomic sequence analysis, they
determined that HERC3 (605200), HERC5, and HERC6 (609249) are clustered
within a 330-kb region on chromosome 4q22. HERC6 and HERC5 are separated
by 14 kb, and HERC5 and HERC3 are separated by 86 kb.

;;TRYPSINOGEN 1; TRY1;;
TRYPSINOGEN, CATIONIC
TRYPSIN 1, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Human pancreatic juice contains 3 isoforms of trypsinogen. On the basis
of their relative electrophoretic mobility, these are commonly referred
to as cationic trypsinogen (PRSS1), anionic trypsinogen (PRSS2; 601564),
and mesotrypsinogen (PRSS3; 613578). Normally, cationic trypsinogen
represents approximately two-thirds of total trypsinogen, while anionic
trypsinogen makes up approximately one-third. Mesotrypsinogen is a minor
species, accounting for less than 5% of trypsinogens or 0.5% of
pancreatic juice proteins (Scheele et al., 1981; Rinderknecht et al.
(1984); summary by Teich et al., 2004).

Trypsin (EC 3.4.21.4) is a member of the pancreatic family of serine
proteases.

CLONING

MacDonald et al. (1982) reported nucleotide sequences of cDNAs
representing 2 pancreatic rat trypsinogens.

Emi et al. (1986) isolated cDNA clones for 2 major human trypsinogen
isozymes from a pancreatic cDNA library. The deduced amino acid
sequences had 89% homology and the same number of amino acids (247),
including a 15-amino acid signal peptide and an 8-amino acid activation
peptide.

Rowen et al. (1996) found that 2 of 3 pancreatically expressed
trypsinogen cDNAs correspond to trypsinogen genes embedded in the beta
T-cell receptor (TCRB; see 186930) cluster of genes mapping to 7q35. T4
was denoted trypsinogen-1 and T8 was denoted trypsinogen-2 (601564). The
third pancreatic cDNA, identified independently as trypsinogen-3 (Tani
et al., 1990) and -4 (Wiegand et al., 1993), is distinct from the third
apparently functional trypsinogen gene (T6) in the TCRB locus but
related to the other pancreatic trypsinogens. Rowen et al. (1996) noted
that the intercalation of the trypsinogen genes in the TCRB locus is
conserved in mouse and chicken, suggesting shared functional or
regulatory constraints, as has been postulated for genes in the major
histocompatibility complex (such as class I, II, and III genes) that
share similar long-term organizational relationships.

GENE STRUCTURE

By alignment of pancreatic trypsinogen cDNAs with the germline
sequences, Rowen et al. (1996) showed that the trypsinogen genes contain
5 exons that span approximately 3.6 kb. Further analyses revealed 2
trypsinogen pseudogenes and 1 relic trypsinogen gene at the 5-prime end
of the sequence, all in inverted transcriptional orientation. They
denoted 8 trypsinogen genes T1 through T8 from 5-prime to 3-prime.

MAPPING

Using a rat cDNA probe, Honey et al. (1984, 1984) found that a 3.8-kb
DNA fragment containing human trypsin-1 gene sequences cosegregated with
chromosome 7, and assigned the gene further to 7q22-7qter by study of
hybrids with a deletion of this segment. The trypsin gene is on mouse
chromosome 6 (Honey et al., 1984). Carboxypeptidase A (114850) and
trypsin are a syntenic pair conserved in mouse and man.

Using Southern blot analysis of human genomic DNA with a cloned cDNA as
probe, Emi et al. (1986) showed that the human trypsinogen genes
constitute a family of more than 10, some of which may be pseudogenes or
may be expressed in other stages of development.

Rowen et al. (1996) mapped the gene corresponding to the third
pancreatic trypsinogen cDNA by fluorescence in situ hybridization. They
used a cosmid clone containing 3 trypsinogen genes. Strong hybridization
to chromosome 7 and weaker hybridization to chromosome 9 were observed.
They isolated and partially sequenced 4 cosmid clones from the
chromosome 9 region. They found that the region represents a duplication
and translocation of a DNA segment from the 3-prime end of the TCRB
locus that includes at least 7 V(beta) elements and a functional
trypsinogen gene denoted T9 (PRSS3; 613578).

Rowen et al. (1996) found that there are 8 trypsinogen genes embedded in
the beta T-cell receptor locus or cluster of genes (TCRB; see 186930)
mapping to 7q35. In the 685-kb DNA segment that they sequenced they
found 5 tandemly arrayed 10-kb locus-specific repeats (homology units)
at the 3-prime end of the locus. These repeats exhibited 90 to 91%
overall nucleotide similarity, and embedded within each is a trypsinogen
gene. Since hereditary pancreatitis (167800) had been mapped rather
precisely to 7q35 and since a defect in the trypsinogen gene has been
identified in hereditary pancreatitis, the assignment of the trypsinogen
gene can be refined from 7q32-qter to 7q35.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Whitcomb et al. (1996) stated that the high degree of DNA sequence
homology (more than 91%) present among this cluster of 5 trypsinogen
genes identified by Rowen et al. (1996) demanded that highly specific
sequence analysis strategies be developed for mutation screening in
families with hereditary pancreatitis (167800). This was necessary to
ensure that each sequencing run contained only the 2 alleles
corresponding to a single gene, thereby permitting detection of
heterozygotes in this autosomal dominant disorder, and not a dozen or
more alleles from multiple related trypsinogen-like genes, which would
make detection of heterozygotes nearly impossible. In a family with
hereditary pancreatitis, Whitcomb et al. (1996) found that affected
individuals had a single G-to-A transition mutation in the third exon of
cationic trypsinogen (276000.0001). This mutation was predicted to
result in an arg105-to-his substitution in the trypsin gene (residue
number 122 in the more common trypsinogen number system; the residue has
also been listed as 117; 276000.0001). Subsequently, the same mutation
was found in a total of 5 different hereditary pancreatitis kindreds (4
from the U.S. and 1 from Italy) containing a total of 20 affected
individuals and 6 obligate carriers. The mutation was found in none of
the obligate unaffected members (individuals who married into the
family). Subsequent haplotyping revealed that all 4 of the American
families displayed the same high risk haplotype over a 4-cM region
encompassing 7 STR markers, confirming the likelihood that these
kindreds shared a common ancestor, although no link could be found
through 8 generations. A fifth family from Italy displayed a unique
haplotype indicating that the same mutation had occurred on at least 2
occasions. The G-to-A mutation at codon 122 created a novel enzyme
recognition site for AflIII which provided a facile means to screen for
the mutation. As with the obligate unaffected members of the
pancreatitis kindreds, none of 140 controls possessed the G-to-A
mutation as assayed by the lack of AflIII digestion of the amplified
exonic DNA.

Ferec et al. (1999) studied 14 families with hereditary pancreatitis and
found mutations in the PRSS1 gene in 8 families. In 4 of these families,
the mutation (R122H; 276000.0001) had been described by Whitcomb et al.
(1996). Three mutations were described in 4 other families (276000.0002,
276000.0003, 276000.0005).

Sahin-Toth et al. (1999) studied the roles of the 2 most frequent PRSS1
mutations in hereditary pancreatitis, R122H and N29I (276000.0002). They
stated that the R122H mutation is believed to cause pancreatitis by
eliminating an essential autolytic cleavage site in trypsin, thereby
rendering the protease resistant to inactivation through autolysis.
Sahin-Toth et al. (1999) demonstrated that the R122H mutation also
significantly inhibited autocatalytic trypsinogen breakdown under
Ca(2+)-free conditions and stabilized the zymogen form of rat trypsin.
Taken together with findings demonstrating that the N29I mutation
stabilized rat trypsinogen against autoactivation and consequent
autocatalytic degradation, the observations suggested a unifying
molecular pathomechanism for hereditary pancreatitis in which zymogen
stabilization plays a central role.

Sahin-Toth and Toth (2000) demonstrated that the R122H and N29I
mutations significantly enhance autoactivation of human cationic
trypsinogen in vitro, in a manner that correlates with the severity of
clinical symptoms in hereditary pancreatitis. In addition, the R122H
mutation inhibited autocatalytic inactivation of trypsin, while the N29I
mutation had no such effect. Thus, increased trypsinogen activation in
the pancreas is presumably the common initiating step in both forms of
hereditary pancreatitis, whereas trypsin stabilization may also
contribute to hereditary pancreatitis associated with the R122H
mutation.

Chen et al. (2001) reviewed aspects of the molecular evolution and
normal physiology of trypsinogen revealed by studies of PRSS1 in
pancreatitis. First, the activation peptide of trypsinogen is under
strong selection pressure to minimize autoactivation in higher
vertebrates. Second, the R122 primary autolysis site (276000.0001) has
further evolved in mammalian trypsinogens. Third, evolutionary
divergence from threonine to asparagine at residue 29 in human cationic
trypsinogen provides additional advantage. Accordingly, Chen et al.
(2001) tentatively assigned, in human cationic trypsinogen, the strongly
selected activation peptide as the first line and the R122 autolysis
site as the second line of the built-in defensive mechanisms against
premature trypsin activation within the pancreas, and the positively
selected asparagine at residue 29 as an 'amplifier' to the R122
'fail-safe' mechanism.

Gene conversion--the substitution of genetic material from one gene to
another--in most cases takes place between a normal gene and its
pseudogene. Teich et al. (2005) reported the occurrence of
disease-associated gene conversion between 2 functional genes. They
analyzed PRSS1 in 1,106 patients with chronic pancreatitis and in 1
patient identified a novel conversion event affecting exon 2 and the
subsequent intron. The conversion replaced at least 289 nucleotides with
the paralogous sequence from the PRSS2 gene and resulted in asn29-to-ile
(N29I; 276000.0002) and asn54-to-ser (N54S) substitutions (276000.0007).
Analysis of the recombinant N29I/N54S double-mutant cationic trypsinogen
revealed increased autocatalytic activation, which was solely due to the
N29I mutation.

Teich et al. (2006) interpreted the 365_366GC-AT R122H variant
(276000.0008) as an example of a gene conversion event. In most such
cases, the donor gene is a duplicated pseudogene which has accumulated
mutations over time. However, there is evidence that gene conversion can
occur between 2 functional paralogous trypsinogen genes and cause
chronic pancreatitis. Trypsinogen genes are tandemly repeated within the
T-cell receptor beta locus (TCRB; see 186930) on 7q35. This is a hotspot
for gene conversion events to generate a broad variety of TCR-beta
genes. Therefore, conversion mutation within the interpolated
trypsinogen gene family are very likely to occur.

Teich et al. (2006) reviewed current information on trypsinogen
mutations and their role in pancreatic diseases. They pointed out that,
although the clinical presentation is highly variable, most affected
mutation carriers have relatively mild disease. Teich et al. (2006)
noted that, in addition to R122 mutations, pancreatitis-producing
mutations had also been identified in the neighboring residues ala121
and val123.

Le Marechal et al. (2006) reviewed observations suggesting that
trypsinogen may be sensitive to a gene dosage effect. They noted that
the R122H mutation (276000.0001) and other pancreatitis-causing PRSS1
missense mutations show by in vitro functional analysis an increase in
trypsin activity (see review by Sahin-Toth, 2006). On the other hand, an
N34S variation (167790.0001) in the SPINK1 gene and rare splicing and
frameshifting mutations in that gene have been detected in individuals
with chronic pancreatitis. SPINK1 encodes trypsin's physiologic
inhibitor, the physiologic function of which appears to be the
prevention of the trypsin-driven digestive enzyme activation cascade.
Loss-of-function mutations in PRSS1 (Chen et al., 2003) and a
degradation-sensitive variant (G191R; 601564.0001) in the PRSS2 gene
seem to confer protection against the disease. Le Marechal et al. (2006)
surmised that an increased copy number of the PRSS1 gene at 7q34 might
account for some of the families with hereditary pancreatitis without a
known causative mutation. They studied a well-characterized cohort of 34
French families with hereditary pancreatitis (defined as 3 or more
affected family members involving at least 2 generations) who did not
carry any causative point mutations in the PRSS1, PRSS2, SPINK1, and
CFTR genes. Analysis of 1 affected individual per family suggested that
the PRSS1 locus was triplicated, and this was confirmed in 5 of the
analyzed families. Use of walking quantitative fluorescent multiplex PCR
showed that the triplication extended approximately 605 kb and included
all members of the trypsinogen gene family on chromosome 7. The size of
the triplicated segment seemed to be the same in all carriers. Affected
individuals in these families shared an identical haplotype that
extended approximately 1,100 kb telomeric to the PRSS1 locus, suggesting
that the triplication represents an identical-by-descent mutation.

In all 6 affected members of a French family with chronic pancreatitis,
Masson et al. (2008) identified the presence of a heterozygous
PRSS1/PRSS2 hybrid gene. Quantitative fluorescent multiplex PCR and
RT-PCR revealed duplication of exons 3 to 5 of PRSS1, and further
analysis indicated that a nonallelic homologous recombination event
resulted in the generation of a hybrid gene containing exons 1 and 2
from PRSS2 and exons 3 to 5 from PRSS1. This hybrid gene was predicted
to encode a zymogen identical to a gene conversion-derived mutant
cationic trypsinogen containing the N29I (276000.0002) and N54S
(276000.0007) mutations. Masson et al. (2008) concluded that this hybrid
gene caused the disease through an inherent double gain-of-function
effect, acting simultaneously through an increased copy number effect
and the N29I mutation.

Szmola and Sahin-Toth (2010) presented evidence that the A121T variant
(276000.0011) is functionally innocuous and not a cause of pancreatitis.
The authors noted that only the index patient in the report of
Felderbauer et al. (2008) carried the A121T variant and suffered from
chronic pancreatitis. The patient's brother and first cousin, who both
carried the variant, had cholelithiasis, and his niece and her mother
were asymptomatic carriers. Functional expression studies by Szmola and
Sahin-Toth (2010) indicated that autoactivation of trypsinogens by the
A121T variant was similar to wildtype with equal enzyme kinetics. Szmola
and Sahin-Toth (2010) suggested that the variant may have been assigned
clinical relevance based on a perceived analogy with the neighboring
disease-causing R122H change (276000.0001 and 276000.0008).

HISTORY

Rowen et al. (1996) stated that the apparently functional T6 gene is
deleted in a common insertion-deletion polymorphism; if the gene is
functional, its function is apparently not essential.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
PANCREATITIS, HEREDITARY
PRSS1, ARG122HIS, 365G-A

The arg122-to-his mutation (R122H; previously designated ARG117HIS, or
R117H, by the chymotrypsin numbering system) was a consistent finding in
all cases of hereditary pancreatitis (167800) examined by Whitcomb et
al. (1996)--a total of 20 affected individuals and 6 obligate carriers
in 5 kindreds. X-ray crystal structure analysis, molecular modeling, and
protein digest data indicated that the arg117 residue is a
trypsin-sensitive site. The authors suggested that cleavage at this site
is probably part of a fail-safe mechanism by which trypsin, which is
activated within the pancreas, may be inactivated; loss of this cleavage
site would permit autodigestion resulting in pancreatitis.

Ferec et al. (1999) detected this mutation in 4 of 8 families with
hereditary pancreatitis caused by mutation in the PRSS1 gene.

In most cases the R122H mutation results from a G-to-A (CGC to CAC)
transition (365G-A), which most probably occurred as a spontaneous
deamination of 5-methylcytosine to give thymine in the CpG dinucleotides
on the opposite strand (Chen and Ferec, 2000). Chen et al. (2000)
identified a GC-to-AT (CGC to CAT) substitution (276000.0008), which
also resulted in an R122H mutation but clearly arose via a different
genetic mechanism, namely, gene conversion. This theory was strongly
supported by the presence of AT in the corresponding position of 2
homologous genes and a Chi-like sequence in the 3-prime vicinity of the
mutation. This mutation would not be detected by the generally used
screening method based on a specific restriction site.

Audrezet et al. (2002) analyzed the entire coding sequence and
exon/intron junctions of the PRSS1 gene by denaturing gradient gel
electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis and direct sequencing in 39 white French
patients with idiopathic chronic pancreatitis. The R122H missense
mutation was found in a 42-year-old male patient who had suffered the
disease from the age of 6 years, and with no family members reported to
have pancreatitis.

Simon et al. (2002) reported the trypsinogen mutation in 5 of 50
patients (10%) with idiopathic pancreatitis; all 5 had the R122H
mutation. Patients with trypsinogen mutations were significantly younger
at disease onset (mean age, 14 years) than the remaining cohort (38
years) and accounted for 35% of the patients younger than 25 years. At
least 1 of the 5 patients could be confidently stated to have a de novo
R122H mutation.

Among cases of chronic pancreatitis, mutations in arg122 and in
neighboring amino acid residues have been found with unusually high
frequency. Furthermore, the R122H mutation has been found worldwide and,
as noted, was identified as a de novo mutation in a German patient by
Simon et al. (2002). An R122C amino acid change (276000.0009) had been
found by 4 groups including their own, according to Teich et al. (2006).
Teich et al. (2006) proposed that the high frequency of mutations in or
close to arg122 causing chronic pancreatitis suggests that 'this
sequence is particularly prone to mutations.'

.0002
PANCREATITIS, HEREDITARY
PRSS1, ASN29ILE

In affected members and obligate carriers of a family originally
reported by Robechek (1967) with hereditary pancreatitis (167800)
believed to be due to hypertrophy of the sphincter of Oddi, Gorry et al.
(1997) identified heterozygosity for an A-to-T transversion in exon 2 of
the PRSS1 gene, resulting in an asn29-to-ile (N29I) substitution.
Affected members of an unrelated family with hereditary pancreatitis,
negative for the common R122H mutation in the PRSS1 gene (276000.0001),
were also found to have the N29I mutation, which was not identified in
188 unrelated control chromosomes.

In 2 unrelated families in a study of 14 hereditary pancreatitis
families, Ferec et al. (1999) reported an A-to-T transversion at codon
29 resulting in the substitution of isoleucine for asparagine.

Chen and Ferec (2000) suggested that the N29I mutation most likely arose
as a gene conversion event in which the functional anionic trypsinogen
gene (PRSS2; 601564) acted as the donor sequence. This hypothesis was
supported by the unique presence of isoleucine at residue 29 of the
anionic gene among the several highly homologous trypsinogen genes; a
single unbroken tract of nucleotides of up to 113 bp flanking the I29
residue in the anionic trypsinogen gene; and the presence of a chi-like
sequence in the 5-prime proximity and a palindromic sequence in the
3-prime vicinity of the N29I mutation. Furthermore, a multiple alignment
of the partial amino acid sequence of vertebrate trypsins around residue
29 indicated that N29 and I29 may represent advantageously selected
mutations of the 2 functional human trypsinogen genes in evolutionary
history.

This mutation has been designated ASN21ILE in a different numbering
system.

PANCREATITIS, HEREDITARY
PRSS1, LYS23ARG

In a study of 14 families with hereditary pancreatitis (167800), Ferec
et al. (1999) identified an A-to-G transition at codon 23 in the PRSS1
gene, resulting in a substitution of arginine for lysine, in 1 family.

PANCREATITIS, HEREDITARY
PRSS1, 3-BP DEL

In a single individual with hereditary pancreatitis (167800), Ferec et
al. (1999) reported a 3-bp deletion (TCC) at position -28 (from ATG).

.0006
PANCREATITIS, HEREDITARY
PRSS1, GLU79LYS

Teich et al. (2004) identified a glu79-to-lys (E79K; 235G-A) mutation of
the PRSS1 gene in 3 European families affected by pancreatitis (167800).
The index patient was a 57-year-old German woman who 6 years previously
had developed recurrent diarrhea that was assumed to be of psychosomatic
origin. Two years previously, she complained of permanently increased
stool frequency, fatty stools, and the recurrent appearance of
undigested nutrients in the stool. Ultrasound revealed calcifications in
the pancreas and a dilated pancreatic duct. Pancreatic enzyme
replacement therapy allowed her to regain weight and relieve her
symptoms. Because of increasing obstruction of the bile duct, a
duodenum-preserving pancreatic head resection was performed. A
68-year-old brother was similarly affected and both were heterozygous
for the E79K mutation.

Teich et al. (2004) described peculiar characteristics of the E79K
mutation. In vitro analysis of recombinant wildtype in mutant enzymes
revealed that the catalytic activity of E79K trypsin was normal, and its
inhibition by pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor (PSTI; 167790) was
unaffected. Although the E79K mutation produced a potential new tryptic
cleavage site, autocatalytic degradation (autolysis) of E79K-trypsin was
also unchanged. In contrast to previously characterized disease-causing
mutations, E79K markedly inhibited autoactivation of cationic
trypsinogen. Remarkably, however, E79K trypsin activated anionic
trypsinogen PRSS2 (601564) 2-fold while the common
pancreatitis-associated mutants R122H (276000.0001) or N29I
(276000.0002), had no such effect. The observations not only suggested a
novel mechanism of action for pancreatitis-associated trypsinogen
mutations, but also highlighted the importance of interactions between
the 2 major trypsinogen isoforms in the development of genetically
determined chronic pancreatitis.

.0007
PANCREATITIS, HEREDITARY
PRSS1, ASN54SER

In a patient with chronic pancreatitis (167800), Teich et al. (2005)
identified a conversion event whereby at least 289 nucleotides in exon 2
and the subsequent intron of the PRSS1 gene were replaced with the
paralogous sequence from the PRSS2 gene (601564), resulting in an 86A-T
transversion and a 161A-G transition, which caused asn29-to-ile (N29I;
276000.0002) and asn54-to-ser (N54S) substitutions, respectively. The
double-mutant cationic trypsinogen showed increased autocatalytic
activation, which was solely due to the N29I mutation.

.0008
PANCREATITIS, HEREDITARY
PRSS1, ARG122HIS, 365GC-AT

In addition to the originally reported and frequently found R122H
mutation due to a single-nucleotide substitution (276000.0001), Chen et
al. (2000) identified a GC-to-AT (CGC to CAT; 365-366GC-AT) substitution
which also causes an R122H mutation and results in chronic pancreatitis
(167800). Teich et al. (2006) interpreted this variant as an example of
a gene conversion event, i.e., the substitution of genetic material from
another gene.

.0009
PANCREATITIS, HEREDITARY
PRSS1, ARG122CYS

Four independent groups (see review by Teich et al., 2006) found this
mutation in arg122, R122C, resulting from a 364C-T transition in exon 3
of the PRSS1 gene in patients with hereditary pancreatitis (167800).

.0010
PANCREATITIS, HEREDITARY
PRSS1, TRIPLICATION

In a study of a cohort of 34 families with hereditary pancreatitis
(167800) but no known missense mutations in PRSS1, PRSS2, SPINK1, or
CFTR, Le Marechal et al. (2006) identified triplication of the PRSS1
gene. Some unaffected members of the family were heterozygous for the
same triplication, indicating a high but incomplete penetrance of the
hereditary pancreatitis caused by the triplication.

Chauvin et al. (2009) characterized the triplication copy number
mutation in the PRSS1 gene and found it to be part of a complex
rearrangement that also contains a triplicated 137-kb segment and 21-bp
sequence tract. The triplication allele constitutes a gain of 2 tandemly
arranged composite duplication blocks, each comprising a copy of the
605-kb segment, a copy of the inverted 137-kb segment, and a copy of the
inverted 21-bp sequence tract. All triplications and duplications
identified were found to arise from a common founder chromosome. The
authors proposed a 2-step process for the generation of the triplication
copy number mutation. Chauvin et al. (2009) hypothesized that many human
germline copy number variants may arise through replication-based
mechanisms during the premeiotic mitotic divisions of germ cells. The
low copy repeats generated could then serve to promote nonallelic
homologous recombination (NAHR) during meiosis, giving rise to amplified
DNA sequences, which could themselves predispose to further
recombination events during both mitosis and meiosis.

.0011
RECLASSIFIED - VARIANT OF UNKNOWN SIGNIFICANCE
PRSS1, ALA121THR

This variant, formerly titled HEREDITARY PANCREATITIS, has been
reclassified based on the findings of Szmola and Sahin-Toth (2010).

In affected members of a family with hereditary pancreatitis (167800),
Felderbauer et al. (2008) identified a heterozygous G-to-A transition in
exon 3 of the PRSS1 gene, resulting in an ala121-to-thr (A121T)
substitution. The proband had relatively late disease onset in his
thirties, and family history indicated reduced penetrance. In vitro
functional expression studies showed that the mutant protein resulted in
increased digestion by trypsin (more than 80% compared to wildtype
PRSS1) that was calcium-dependent. The findings were consistent with a
increased autodegradation and a loss of function mechanism, which was
opposite to that observed with the common R122H mutation (276000.0001).

Szmola and Sahin-Toth (2010) presented evidence that the A121T variant
is functionally innocuous and not a cause of pancreatitis. The authors
noted that only the index patient in the report of Felderbauer et al.
(2008) carried the A121T variant and suffered from chronic pancreatitis.
The patient's brother and first cousin, who both carried the variant,
had cholelithiasis, and his niece and her mother were asymptomatic
carriers. Functional expression studies by Szmola and Sahin-Toth (2010)
indicated that autoactivation of trypsinogens by the A121T variant was
similar to wildtype with equal enzyme kinetics. Szmola and Sahin-Toth
(2010) suggested that the variant may have been assigned clinical
relevance based on a perceived analogy with the neighboring
disease-causing R122H mutations (276000.0001 and 276000.0008).

.0012
PANCREATITIS, HEREDITARY
PRSS1, ARG116CYS

Teich et al. (2006) reported that the 346C-T transition in exon 3 of the
PRSS1 gene, resulting in an arg116-to-cys (R116C) substitution, had been
identified by 4 independent groups in Turkish, German, and Thai families
with hereditary pancreatitis (167800) and in 2 unrelated French patients
with pancreatitis.

In an 11-year-old German girl with hereditary pancreatitis, originally
reported by Teich et al. (2002), Kereszturi et al. (2009) showed that
trypsinogen misfolding is the likely disease mechanism. The R116C
substitution occurs in a surface loop that is highly sensitive to
autolytic cleavage. In vitro functional expression studies showed that
the R116C mutation resulted in misfolding of the protein, but residual
amounts of properly folded protein showed normal activation, catalytic
properties, and degradation. Expression of the mutant protein in HEK
293T cells showed decreased secretion compared to wildtype, suggesting
that the unpaired cysteine residue at codon 116 interferes with proper
protein folding, resulting in the mutant protein being retained inside
the cell. Biochemical evidence indicated activation of the unfolded
protein response, although there was no evidence of increased caspase-3
(CASP3; 600636) activity. The R116C mutation was also found in the
girl's 57-year-old affected maternal grandfather and her 38-year-old
unaffected mother, indicating incomplete penetrance.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (EC 4.1.2.13) is a glycolytic enzyme
that catalyzes the reversible conversion of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate to
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate. The enzyme is
a tetramer of identical 40-kD subunits. Vertebrates have 3 aldolase
isozymes, aldolases A, B (ALDOB; 612724), and C (ALDOC; 103870), which
are distinguished by their electrophoretic and catalytic properties. The
sequence of the aldolases around the active-site lysine is highly
conserved in evolution. Mammalian tissues express aldolase isozymes in a
well-characterized pattern. Developing embryo produces aldolase A, which
continues to be expressed in many adult tissues, sometimes at much
higher levels than in embryo. In adult muscle, aldolase A can be as much
as 5% of total cellular protein. In adult liver, kidney, and intestine,
aldolase A expression is repressed and aldolase B is produced. In brain
and other nervous tissue, aldolase A and C are expressed about equally.
In transformed liver cells, aldolase A replaces aldolase B (Rottmann et
al., 1984).

CLONING

Electrophoretic variants of fructoaldolase were reported by Charlesworth
(1972).

Sakakibara et al. (1985) cloned aldolase A from a human liver cDNA
library. The deduced protein contains 363 amino acids. RNA blot analysis
revealed a 1.6-kb ALDOA mRNA in skeletal muscle and a 1.7-kb ALDOA mRNA
in liver and placenta.

Freemont et al. (1988) presented the complete amino acid sequence of
human skeletal muscle fructose-bisphosphate aldolase, comprising 363
residues.

GENE STRUCTURE

Izzo et al. (1988) found that the ALDOA gene spans 7.5 kb and contains
12 exons. It occurs as a single copy per haploid human genome. Eight
exons containing the coding sequence were common to all mRNAs extracted
from several mammalian sources. Four additional exons were identified in
the 5-prime UTR: the first was contained in the ubiquitous mRNA, the
second in the muscle-specific mRNA, and the third and fourth in a minor
mRNA in human liver. S(1)-nuclease-protection analysis of the 5-prime
end of mRNA from cultured fibroblasts, muscle, and hepatoma cell lines
revealed 4 different transcription initiation sites. The presence of
conventional sequences for 4 eukaryotic promoters was also demonstrated.
The nucleotide similarities in the coding region and the intron-exon
organization of aldolases A, B, and C confirmed that they arose from a
common ancestral gene, with aldolase B diverging first.

MAPPING

Harris (1974) concluded that 3 loci determine aldolase. Cohen-Haguenauer
et al. (1985) assigned aldolase A to chromosome 16, whereas Kukita et
al. (1985) assigned it to chromosome 22. However, Kukita et al. (1987)
mapped the ALDOA gene to chromosome 16 by 3 different methods: molecular
hybridization to hybrid cell DNA, molecular hybridization to DNA of
sorted metaphase chromosomes, and in situ hybridization. In situ
hybridization indicated that the gene is located on the chromosome
16q22-q24 band. Serero et al. (1988) also assigned the aldolase A gene
to chromosome 16 by Southern blot analysis of human genomic DNA with a
cDNA probe. Aldolase A pseudogenes were found on chromosomes 3 and 10.
The map location of the 3 aldolase genes and the aldolase pseudogene
(see 612724) is of considerable interest from the point of view of
chromosome evolution. The 4 genes are found on 2 pairs of
morphologically similar chromosomes, 9 and 10, and 16 and 17. These
homeologous (i.e., of similar origin) chromosome pairs may have arisen
from 1 or 2 tetraploidization events (Comings, 1972; Ohno, 1973). As
predicted by the chromosomal locations, the coding sequences of the
expressed aldolase A and C genes on chromosomes 16 and 17, respectively,
are more homologous to each other than either of them is to the
expressed aldolase B gene on chromosome 9.

Amberger (2008) mapped the ALDOA gene to chromosome 16p11.2 based on an
alignment of the ALDOA sequence (GenBank GENBANK M11560) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.2).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Kishi et al. (1987) studied a patient with red cell aldolase deficiency,
or glycogen storage disease XII (GSD12; 611881), and identified a
mutation in the ALDOA gene that resulted in an asp128-to-gly (D128G;
103850.0001) substitution in the protein. The patient's enzyme from red
cells and from cultured lymphoblastoid cells was highly thermolabile,
and the enzyme expressed in E. coli was likewise thermolabile. The
parents had intermediate levels of red cell aldolase A. Southern blot
analysis of genomic DNA showed that the patient was homozygous for a
mutation that was heterozygous in both parents.

In a boy with aldolase A deficiency, Kreuder et al. (1996) identified a
homozygous germline mutation in the ALDOA gene that resulted
substitution of a negatively charged glutamic acid with a positively
charged lysine at the highly conserved residue 206 (E206L; 103850.0002).
The affected residue is highly conserved within the subunit interface
region.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE XII
ALDOA, ASP128GLY

In a patient with red cell aldolase deficiency, or glycogen storage
disease XII (GSD12; 611881), Kishi et al. (1987) identified an A-G
transversion at nucleotide 386 in the codon for the 128th amino acid,
leading to a change from aspartic acid (GAU) to glycine (GGU) (D128G) in
the aldolase protein. The patient's enzyme from red cells and from
cultured lymphoblastoid cells was highly thermolabile, and the enzyme
expressed in E. coli was likewise thermolabile. Since asp128 is
conserved in aldolase A, B (612724), and C (103870) of eukaryotes,
including Drosophila, this residue likely has a crucial role in
maintaining the correct spatial structure or in performing the catalytic
function of the enzyme. The parents had intermediate levels of red cell
aldolase A. The change in the aspartic acid codon extinguished an Fok1
restriction site (GGATG to GGGTG). Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA
showed that the patient was homozygous for a mutation that was
heterozygous in both parents.

.0002
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE XII
ALDOA, GLU206LYS

Kreuder et al. (1996) described a 4 1/2-year-old boy with predominantly
myopathic symptoms of aldolase A deficiency (611881) due to substitution
of a single amino acid within the subunit interface most essential for
the tetrameric structure of the enzyme. The patient showed muscle
weakness and premature muscle fatigue. He was unable to walk for more
than 10 minutes or climb more than 20 steps at a time. Several
unexplained episodes of jaundice and anemia required blood transfusions
during the first year of life. The parents were healthy and
nonconsanguineous. The patient showed slight jaundice, diminished muscle
mass, reduced muscle tone, and proximal muscle weakness. The liver and
spleen were somewhat enlarged. Creatine kinase was markedly elevated in
the blood of this patient, and several muscle enzymes, as well as serum
bilirubin, were increased. Codon 206 of the ALDOA gene was found to have
a homozygous transition from GAG (glu) to AAG (lys) (E206K). The authors
noted that a glutamate is present in all human aldolases at position 206
of the enzyme. Both parents and a healthy brother were heterozygous for
the mutation.
