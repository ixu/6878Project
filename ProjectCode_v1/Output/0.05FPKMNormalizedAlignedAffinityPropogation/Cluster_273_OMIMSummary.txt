;;PEROXISOMAL MEMBRANE PROTEIN 1-LIKE; PXMP1L;;
P70R;;
PMP69
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The ABCD4 gene encodes a protein with several transmembrane domains and
ATPase function. There is a cytosolic nucleotide (ATP)-binding domain
with highly conserved motifs at the C terminus. The protein is involved
in the intracellular processing of cobalamin (vitamin B12) (summary by
Coelho et al., 2012).

CLONING

The peroxisomal membrane contains several ATP-binding cassette (ABC)
transporters, including PMP70 (ABCD3; 170995), ALDP (ABCD1; 300371), and
ALDR (ABCD2; 601081). All 3 proteins are ABC half-transporters, which
dimerize to form an active transporter. See 603076. By searching an EST
database for homologs of PMP70 and ALDP, Shani et al. (1997) and
Holzinger et al. (1997) identified PXMP1L cDNAs. They respectively
designated the gene P70R and PMP69. Shani et al. (1997) reported that
the predicted 606-amino acid protein has the structure of an ABC
half-transporter and shares 25 to 27% sequence identity with PMP70,
ALDR, and ALDP. Antibodies against PXMP1L detected a 73-kD protein on
Western blots. Immunofluorescence studies localized the protein to
peroxisomes. Northern blot analysis revealed that PXMP1L was expressed
as a 2.6-kb mRNA in all tissues examined. Holzinger et al. (1997) and
Holzinger et al. (1998) found transcript variants resulting from
alternative splicing and use of alternative polyadenylation sites.

GENE STRUCTURE

Holzinger et al. (1998) reported that the PXMP1L gene contains 19 exons
and spans approximately 16 kb.

MAPPING

By analysis of a somatic cell hybrid panel and by identity with mapped
clones, Shani et al. (1997) mapped the PXMP1L gene to 14q24. Holzinger
et al. (1998) confirmed this localization by fluorescence in situ
hybridization. They noted that part of a PXMP1L cDNA was included in a
cosmid derived from chromosome 14q24.3.

GENE FUNCTION

Coelho et al. (2012) demonstrated that ABCD4 colocalized with the
lysosomal proteins LAMP1 (153330) and LMBRD1 (612625), the latter of
which is deficient in methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinuria, type
cblF (277380). Cellular studies with mutant ABCD4 alleles indicated that
the ATPase domain of ABCD4 may be involved in the intracellular
processing of vitamin B12 (cobalamin). The biochemical findings and
localization studies suggested that ABCD4 is involved in the lysosomal
release of cbl into the cytoplasm. Although ABCD4 was initially thought
to be a peroxisomal protein, Coelho et al. (2012) provided evidence
against the involvement of peroxisomes in cbl metabolism.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Childhood cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy (CCER), adrenomyeloneuropathy
(AMN), and AMN with cerebral demyelination are the main phenotypic
variants of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD; 300100), which is caused
by mutation in the ABCD1 gene (300371). The biochemical hallmark of ALD
is the accumulation of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) in plasma and
tissues. Asheuer et al. (2005) studied the expression of the ABCD1,
ABCD2, ABCD3 (170995), and ABCD4 genes and 2 VLCFA synthetase genes,
VLCS (SLC27A2; 603247) and BG1 (ACSBG1; 614362), in fibroblasts and
brains from normal controls and ALD patients with the 3 main phenotypes,
and they studied VLCFA concentrations in normal-appearing white matter
from ALD patients with the 3 main phenotypes. The authors showed that
ABCD1-truncating mutations were unlikely to cause variation in the ALD
phenotype. Accumulation of saturated VLCFA in normal-appearing white
matter correlated with ALD phenotype. Expression of ABCD4 and BG1, but
not of the ABCD2, ABCD3, and VLCS genes, tended to correlate with the
severity of the disease, acting early in the pathogenesis of ALD.

In 2 unrelated children with methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinuria
type cblJ (614857), Coelho et al. (2012) identified 4 different
mutations in the ABCD4 gene (603214.0001-603214.0004) in compound
heterozygous state. The mutations, which were found using
microcell-mediated chromosome transfer and exome sequencing, resulted in
a loss of function. The patients presented soon after birth with
hypotonia, respiratory distress, and evidence of bone marrow failure.
One child had mild dysmorphic features, cardiac abnormalities, and
delayed psychomotor development. Biochemical studies confirmed a defect
in cobalamin metabolism and were similar to abnormalities observed in
patients with cblF (277380). Patient cell lines showed no rescue of the
defect when transfected with LMBRD1, suggesting that these 2 genes
function in the same pathway.

In a North American child with methylmalonic aciduria and
homocystinuria, complementation group J (cblJ; 614857), Coelho et al.
(2012) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the ABCD4
gene: a 956A-G transition resulting in a tyr319-to-cys (Y319C)
substitution in the last transmembrane domain, and a 2-bp insertion
(1746insCT; 603214.0001), resulting in a frameshift and premature
termination (Glu583LeufsTer9) leading to the removal of 14 residues from
the C terminus in the predicted cytosolic nucleotide binding domain. The
mutations were identified by exome sequencing and confirmed by Sanger
sequencing. Each unaffected parent was heterozygous for 1 of the
mutations. Neither mutation was found in the 1000 Genomes Project data
set. Expression of wildtype ABCD4 in patient fibroblasts led to rescue
of the biochemical phenotype.

In a European child with methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinuria,

compound heterozygosity for 2 splice site mutations in the ABCD4 gene: a
G-T transversion in intron 5 (542+1G-T), resulting in the skipping of
exon 5 (D143_S181del), which encodes 1 of the transmembrane domains, and
a 1456G-T transversion at the last nucleotide in exon 14, resulting in
the skipping of exons 13 and 14 (G443_S485del; 603214.0004) in the
cytosolic nucleotide binding domain. The mutations were identified by
microcell-mediated chromosome transfer and exome sequencing. Neither
mutation was found in the 1000 Genomes Project data set. Expression of
wildtype ABCD4 in patient fibroblasts led to rescue of the biochemical
phenotype.

;;LIN28;;
ZINC FINGER CCHC DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1; ZCCHC1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database searching with the sequence of C. elegans lin28, a regulator
of developmental timing, Moss and Tang (2003) identified homologs in
several species from Drosophila to human. In each species the protein
contains a conserved combination of RNA-binding motifs: a cold shock
domain (CSD) and a pair of retroviral-type CCHC zinc knuckles. The human
and mouse LIN28A proteins share 97% sequence identity. Yang and Moss
(2003) showed that in mammals, LIN28A protein is stage-specifically
expressed in embryonic muscle, neurons, and epithelia, as well as in
embryonic carcinoma cells; however, it is suppressed in most adult
tissues except for skeletal and cardiac muscle.

GENE STRUCTURE

Moss and Tang (2003) determined that the LIN28A gene contains 4 exons.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Moss and Tang (2003) mapped the human LIN28A gene
to chromosome 1 and the mouse Lin28a gene to a region of syntenic
homology on chromosome 4.

Scott (2007) mapped the LIN28A gene to chromosome 1p36.11 based on an
alignment of the LIN28A sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF521099) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.2).

GENE FUNCTION

Wu and Belasco (2005) showed that human LIN28 mRNA is a target of the
micro RNAs miR-125b (610104) and miRNA-125a (611191). They identified 2
miRNA-responsive elements (miREs) that mediate repression in the 3-prime
UTR of LIN28. When the miREs were deleted, miRNA control over LIN28
nearly vanished. Lin28 downregulation by miR-125 involved reductions in
both translational efficiency and mRNA abundance.

By use of loss-of-function and gain-of-function assays in cultured
myoblasts, Polesskaya et al. (2007) showed that expression of Lin28 was
essential for skeletal muscle differentiation in mice and that Lin28
binds to polysomes, thereby increasing the efficiency of protein
synthesis. An important target of Lin28 is Igf2 (147470), a growth and
differentiation factor for muscle tissue. Interaction of Lin28 with
translation initiation complexes in skeletal myoblasts and in the
embryonic carcinoma cell line P19 was confirmed by localization of Lin28
to the stress granules, temporary structures that contain stalled
mRNA-protein translation complexes.

Yu et al. (2007) showed that 4 factors, OCT4 (164177), SOX2 (184429),
NANOG (607937), and LIN28, are sufficient to reprogram human somatic
cells to pluripotent stem cells that exhibit the essential
characteristics of embryonic stem cells. These induced pluripotent human
stem cells have normal karyotypes, express telomerase activity, express
cell surface markers and genes that characterize human ES cells, and
maintain the developmental potential to differentiate into advanced
derivatives of all 3 primary germ layers.

Viswanathan et al. (2008) showed that Lin28 selectively blocks the
processing of Let7 (see 605386) primary (pri-Let7) miRNAs in embryonic
cells. Using in vitro and in vivo studies, they found that Lin28 is
necessary and sufficient for blocking Microprocessor-mediated cleavage
of pri-Let7 miRNAs. Viswanathan et al. (2008) concluded that their
results identified Lin28 as a negative regulator of miRNA biogenesis,
and suggested that Lin28 may play a central role in blocking
miRNA-mediated differentiation in stem cells and in certain cancers.

Viswanathan et al. (2009) found that overexpression of murine Lin28 and
Lin28b (611044) in NIH/3T3 cells depleted levels of multiple mature
miRNAS in the LET7 family and resulted in increased c-Myc (190080) as
well as colony formation. Cells expressing either Lin28 or human LIN28B
formed tumors in nude mice. In vitro and in vivo studies with
cytokine-dependent BaF/3 cells showed that overexpression of LIN28 could
facilitate cellular transformation. LIN28 and LIN28B were found to be
overexpressed in primary human tumors and human cancer cell lines
(overall frequency of about 15%), and overexpression was linked to
repression of LET7 family miRNAs and derepression of LET7 target genes.
The findings provided a mechanism for the coordinate repression of LET7
miRNAs observed in a subset of human cancers, and associated activation
of LIN28 and LIN28B with poor clinical prognosis.

West et al. (2009) differentiated mouse embryonic stem cells carrying a
Stella (DPPA3; 608408) transgenic reporter into putative primordial germ
cells (PGCs) in vitro. The Stella-positive cells possessed a
transcriptional profile similar to embryo-derived PGCs, and like their
counterparts in vivo, lost imprints in a time-dependent manner. Using
inhibitory RNAs to screen candidate genes for effects on the development
of Stella-positive cells in vitro, West et al. (2009) found that Lin28,
a negative regulator of let7 microRNA processing, is essential for
proper PGC development. Furthermore, Blimp1 (PRDM1; 603423), a let7
target and a master regulator of PGC specification, rescued the effect
of Lin28 deficiency during PGC development, thereby establishing a
mechanism of action for Lin28 during PGC specification. Overexpression
of Lin28 promotes formation of Stella-positive cells in vitro and PGCs
in chimeric embryos, and is associated with human germ cell tumors.

Hanna et al. (2009) demonstrated that the reprogramming by Oct4, Sox2,
Klf4, and Myc transcription factors is a continuous stochastic process
where almost all mouse donor cells eventually give rise to induced
pluripotent stem (iPS) cells on continued growth and transcription
factor expression. Additional inhibition of the p53 (191170)/p21
(116899) pathway or overexpression of Lin28 increased the cell division
rate and resulted in an accelerated kinetics of iPS cell formation that
was directly proportional to the increase in cell proliferation. In
contrast, Nanog overexpression accelerated reprogramming in a
predominantly cell division rate-independent manner. Quantitative
analyses defined distinct cell division rate-dependent and -independent
modes for accelerating the stochastic course of reprogramming, and
suggested that the number of cell divisions is a key parameter driving
epigenetic reprogramming to pluripotency.

The pluripotency factor LIN28 blocks the expression of LET7 microRNAs in
undifferentiated cells during development by binding to pre-LET7 RNAs
and recruiting RNA uridyltransferases ZCCHC11 (613692) and ZCCHC6 to
uridylate pre-let7. The identity of the RNase that degrades uridylated
pre-LET7 was unknown. Chang et al. (2013) identified Dis3l2 (614184) as
the 3-prime-5-prime exonuclease responsible for the decay of uridylated
pre-let7 in mouse embryonic stem cells. Biochemical reconstitution
assays showed that 3-prime oligouridylation stimulates Dis3l2 activity
in vitro, and knockdown of Dis3l2 in mouse embryonic stem cells leads to
the stabilization of pre-let7. Chang et al. (2013) concluded that their
study established 3-prime oligouridylation as an RNA decay signal for
DIS3L2 and identified the first physiologic RNA substrate of this
exonuclease.

ANIMAL MODEL

Zhu et al. (2010) generated transgenic mice expressing Lin28a and
observed increased body size and crown-rump length, with increased bone
mineral content and density, and delayed onset of puberty. The
transgenic mice also had increased glucose metabolism and insulin
sensitivity. Zhu et al. (2010) noted that this phenotype models that of
human phenotypes (see MENAQ2, 612882) associated with genetic variation
in the LIN28-LET7 pathway.

614953	TITLE *614953 SCHLAFEN FAMILY, MEMBER 11; SLFN11
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The Schlafen (SFLN) family contains 9 mouse and 6 human genes that
encode proteins with a conserved N terminus containing a putative AAA
ATPase domain. Longer SLFN proteins, such as SLFN11, have C-terminal
motifs resembling DNA/RNA helicase domains. Studies in mouse have
implicated SLFN proteins in regulation of cell growth and T-cell
development (summary by Geserick et al. (2004) and Li et al. (2012)).

CLONING

Geserick et al. (2004) identified mouse Slfn5 (614952), Slfn8, Slfn9,
and Slfn10, which encode proteins that share significant homology with
mouse Slfn1 through Slfn4 in their N-terminal halves, but contain unique
C-terminal extensions with motifs homologous to DNA/RNA helicases.
Slfn8, Slfn9, and Slfn10 share 85 to 87% amino acid identity with one
another, whereas Slfn5 is more distantly related to the former group,
sharing 40% identity.

Van Zuylen et al. (2011) noted that human SLFN11 and SLFN13 (614957) are
orthologous to mouse Slfn8, Slfn9, and Slfn10.

Li et al. (2012) stated that the 901-amino acid human SLFN11 protein has
an AAA domain in its N-terminal half and a putative helicase sequence in
its C-terminal half. Quantitative RT-PCR showed that SLFN5 and SLFN11
were the most prominently expressed SLFN family members in several human
cell lines.

MAPPING

Gross (2012) mapped the SLFN11 gene to chromosome 17q12 based on an
alignment of the SLFN11 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC052586) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

Bustos et al. (2009) found that the SLFN genes are clustered within the
same orthologous region flanked by the UNC45 (UNC45B; 611220) and PEX12
(601758) genes in all mammalian genomes examined. The human and mouse
SLFN clusters are located on chromosomes 17 and 11, respectively.

GENE FUNCTION

Li et al. (2012) noted that levels of mouse SLFN proteins are elevated
after infection with Brucella or Listeria. Using quantitative RT-PCR,
they showed that lipopolysaccharide, poly-IC, or interferon (IFN)-alpha
(147660)/beta (147640) treatment of murine macrophages resulted in
induction of several SLFN genes. Treatment of human foreskin fibroblasts
with IFN-beta, poly-IC, or poly-dAdT revealed similar induction of SLFN
genes, including SLFN5 and SLFN11. Li et al. (2012) found that human
SLFN11, but not SLFN5, potently and specifically abrogated production of
retroviruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 (see 609423),
and diminished the number of viral particles released from cells. The
inhibitory activity resided in the 579-residue N-terminal half of
SLFN11, which includes the AAA domain. Rather than affecting early steps
of the retroviral infection cycle, including reverse transcription,
integration, and transcription, SLFN11 selectively inhibited expression
of viral proteins in a codon-usage-dependent manner. SLFN11 bound tRNA
and counteracted changes in the tRNA pool elicited by HIV. Li et al.
(2012) concluded that SLFN11 is a potent, IFN-inducible restriction
factor against retroviruses that mediates its antiviral effects on the
basis of codon usage discrimination.

- Putative Mouse Orthologs of SLFN11

Using Northern blot analysis, Geserick et al. (2004) detected expression
of most mouse SLFN genes examined in Listeria monocytogenes-infected
mouse splenocytes, with little or no expression in uninfected mouse
cells. Ifngr (107470) was required for Slfn5, Slfn8, Slfn9, and Slfn10
upregulation. Further analysis showed that mouse SLFNs were
differentially regulated in developing thymocytes, in activated
peripheral T cells, in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- or interferon-gamma
(IFNG; 147570)-activated macrophages, or during terminal myeloid
differentiation of M1 leukemia cells. Transgenic expression in mice
revealed that dysregulated expression of Slfn8 negatively influenced
thymocyte development and impaired the response of peripheral T cells to
T-cell receptor (see 186880)-mediated stimulation. Geserick et al.
(2004) concluded that SLFN genes are integrated into regulatory networks
that control T-cell development and activation.

EVOLUTION

Bustos et al. (2009) used genomic and phylogenetic studies to
investigate the evolution and role of the SLFN gene family. They found
that the SLFN family is widely distributed in mammals, with 4 major
clades that underwent lineage-specific expansions or contractions in
various orders, including primates and rodents. Bustos et al. (2009)
also identified SLFN family members in Chondrichthyes and Amphibia. They
found evidence that positive selection has acted on many SLFN genes. A
member of the SLFN family was horizontally transferred from mouse to
orthopoxviruses, where the authors hypothesized it plays a role in
allowing the virus to survive host defense mechanisms. The viral SLFN
sequences are evolving under purifying selection, indicating their
functional relevance.

Van Zuylen et al. (2011) noted that only 2 SLFN family members, SLFN5
and SLFN14 (614958), have direct orthologs in mouse and human,
consistent with rapid evolution of the SLFN family across mammalian
species. Human SLFN12 (614955) and SLFN12L (614956) have 4 orthologs in
mice (Slfn1, Slfn2, Slfn3, and Slfn4), and human SLFN11 and SLFN13 have
3 orthologs in mice (Slfn8, Slfn9, and Slfn10).

600540	TITLE *600540 TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR Sp4; SP4
;;HF1B
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Transcriptional regulation is exerted through protein factors that bind
to distinct DNA elements in the vicinity of target genes. Many control
elements are recognized by different members of transcription factor
families, opening combinatorial possibilities of the regulatory
interactions. Among the most widely distributed control elements are GC
boxes and related motifs bound by SP1 (189906). Hagen et al. (1992)
performed recognition site screening for factors which bind to the
uteroglobin promoter sequence GT box and cloned cDNAs encoding the
DNA-binding proteins SP3 (601804) and SP4, thus revealing the existence
of a multigene family of SP proteins. They found that SP1, SP3, and SP4
exhibit similar structural features: all contain DNA-binding domains
composed of 3 zinc fingers of the cys2/his2 type near the C terminus,
and all recognize GC- and GT-box sequences. Additionally, the N termini
of all 3 proteins are composed of long serine/threonine- and
glutamine-rich regions that have been identified in SP1 as
transactivation domains. Hagen et al. (1992) showed by Northern blot
analysis that SP4 is abundantly expressed as a 7.5-kb message in brain,
but barely detectable in other human cell lines.

GENE FUNCTION

Hagen et al. (1995) used cotransfection experiments to show that SP4 is
an activator protein like SP1. However, in contrast to SP1, they found
that SP4 is not able to act synergistically through adjacent binding
sites.

Hirose and Horvitz (2013) showed that the C. elegans Sp1 transcription
factor SPTF3, which is most similar to human SP4, specifies the
programmed cell deaths of at least 2 cells, the sisters of the
pharyngeal M4 motor neuron and the AQR sensory neuron, by
transcriptionally activating both caspase-dependent and -independent
apoptotic pathways. SPTF3 directly drives the transcription of the gene
egl-1, which encodes a BH3-only protein that promotes apoptosis through
the activation of the CED3 caspase. In addition, SPTF3 directly drives
the transcription of the AMP-activated protein kinase-related gene
pig-1, which encodes a protein kinase closely related to mammalian MELK
(607025), and functions in apoptosis of the M4 sister and AQR sister
independently of the pathway that activated CED3. Hirose and Horvitz
(2013) concluded that a single transcription factor controls 2 distinct
cell-killing programs that act in parallel to drive apoptosis.

MAPPING

Kalff-Suske et al. (1995) assigned the SP4 gene to human chromosome 7
using Southern blot hybridization to a human-rodent somatic cell hybrid
panel. Subsequently, they narrowed the assignment to 7p21-p13 by PCR
amplification of genomic template DNA from somatic cell hybrids
containing fragments of this chromosome. The chromosomal localization
was further refined by fluorescence in situ hybridization to 7p15. The
previous assignment of the SP1 gene to chromosome 12q13, together with
the assignment of the SP4 gene to chromosome 7p15, increases the number
of known paralogous relationships between human chromosomes 7 and 12.

ANIMAL MODEL

Nguyen-Tran et al. (2000) reported that mice deficient in Hf1b/Sp4
survived to term and exhibited normal cardiac structure and function but
displayed sudden cardiac death and a complete penetrance of conduction
system defects, including spontaneous ventricular tachycardia and a high
incidence of AV block. Continuous electrocardiographic recordings
clearly documented cardiac arrhythmogenesis as the cause of death.
Single-cell analysis revealed an anatomic substrate for
arrhythmogenesis, including a decrease and mislocalization of connexins
and a marked increase in action potential heterogeneity. Two independent
markers revealed defects in the formation of ventricular Purkinje
fibers. The authors concluded that these studies identified a novel
genetic pathway for sudden cardiac death via defects in the transition
between ventricular and conduction system cell lineages.

Gollner et al. (2001) found that Sp4 knockout mice, with a complete
absence of Sp4 expression due to targeted deletion of the exons encoding
the N-terminal activation domains, showed a complex phenotype. They
developed until birth without obvious abnormalities. After birth,
two-thirds died within 4 weeks. Surviving mice were growth retarded.
Males homozygous for the null mutation did not breed; the reason for
this remained obscure since they showed complete spermatogenesis, and
pheromone receptor genes in the vomeronasal organ appeared unaffected.
Female null mice had a smaller thymus, spleen, and uterus and exhibited
a pronounced delay in sexual maturation. Thus, the phenotype of the
Sp4-null mice differed significantly from those described for the Sp1-
and Sp3-null mice. The authors concluded that the structural
similarities, the common recognition motif, and the overlapping
expression pattern of these 3 transcription factors do not reflect
similar physiologic functions.

Zhou et al. (2010) stated that mice with hypomorphic Sp4 expression
display subtle vacuolization of the hippocampus and deficits in
sensorimotor gating and contextual memory. They found that Sp4
hypomorphic mice also showed deficits in spatial learning and memory.
Western blot and immunohistochemical analyses of Sp4 hypomorphic brain
revealed reduced protein expression of the NMDA receptor subunit Nr1
(GRIN1; 138249) in hippocampus and cortex. No difference was observed in
expression of the 4 Nr2 proteins (e.g., GRIN2A; 138253), and RT-PCR
detected no difference in Nr1 mRNA levels between Sp4 hypomorphic and
wildtype hippocampus. Zhou et al. (2010) suggested that the Sp4
hypomorphic mouse may represent a novel hypoglutamatergic model for
psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia (see 181500).

611665	TITLE *611665 DEAD/H BOX 54; DDX54
;;DEAD BOX RNA HELICASE, 97-KD; DP97
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

DEAD box family members, including DDX54, are putative ATP-dependent RNA
helicases that play important roles in a variety of cellular processes
including cell development, differentiation, and proliferation. The name
of the gene family is derived from the amino acid sequence
Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (DEAD), one of at least 8 highly conserved motifs shared
by the family members. See also DDX8 (600396).

CLONING

By yeast 2-hybrid screening of human breast cancer cells using
antiestrogen-liganded ER-alpha (ESR1; 133430) as bait, followed by
screening a human muscle cDNA library, Rajendran et al. (2003) cloned
DDX54, which they called DP97. The deduced 865-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 97 kD. DDX54 contains 2 bipartite nuclear
localization signals, 3 nuclear receptor boxes (LXXLL motifs), a
potential CoRNR box, and several stretches of glutamate and lysine
residues. Northern blot analysis detected a 3.1-kb transcript and a
minor 4.3-kb transcript in several human cancer cell lines and in all
tissues examined, with highest expression in pancreas and lung.
Immunocytochemical studies localized DDX54 to the nucleus where it was
distributed throughout the nucleoplasm and concentrated at the nucleoli.
DDX54 colocalized with ER-alpha to speckled structures in the
nucleoplasm.

GENE FUNCTION

Rajendran et al. (2003) showed that DDX54 displayed ATP-dependent RNA
helicase activity. In vitro binding and yeast 2-hybrid analysis showed
stronger interaction for antiestrogen-liganded ER-alpha than for
estradiol-liganded ER-alpha. In DDX54-transfected Chinese hamster ovary
(CHO) cells, transactivation assays demonstrated that DDX54 repressed
ER-alpha transcriptional activity, and DDX54 also displayed nuclear
receptor corepressor activity against ER-beta (ESR2; 601663),
progesterone (PGR; 607311), glucocorticoid (GCCR; 138040), and RARA
(180240). Deletion studies and Gal4 fusion studies showed that DDX54
amino acids 589-631 function as the transcriptional repression domain
and that the C-terminal DDX54 amino acids 664-865 interact with the
C-terminal portion of nuclear receptors. Both antisense and siRNA
knockdown of DDX54 caused an increase in ER transcriptional activity and
expression of estradiol-stimulated genes.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Rajendran et al. (2003) mapped the DDX54
gene to chromosome 12q22-q23.

612960	TITLE *612960 EPITHELIAL SPLICING REGULATORY PROTEIN 2; ESRP2
;;RNA-BINDING MOTIF PROTEIN 35B; RBM35B
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ESPR2 is an epithelial cell-type-specific splicing regulator (Warzecha
et al., 2009).

CLONING

Using a cell-based cDNA expression screen with human embryonic kidney
293T cells, Warzecha et al. (2009) identified mouse Esrp1 (612959) and
Esrp2 as regulators of FGFR2 (176943) splicing. By database analysis,
they identified human ESRP2, which encodes a deduced protein containing
3 central RNA recognition motifs (RRMs). Comparison of ESRP orthologs in
diverse species showed significant sequence conservation within the RRM
domains, particularly RRM1. In mouse embryos, expression of Esrp2
appeared to be specific to epithelial cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Cell type-specific expression of epithelial and mesenchymal isoforms of
FGFR2 is achieved through tight regulation of mutually exclusive exons
IIIb and IIIc, respectively. Warzecha et al. (2009) showed that
expression of epitope-tagged mouse Esrp1 or Esrp2 in 293T cells induced
a substantial switch of endogenous FGFR2 transcripts from the
mesenchymal form with exon IIIc to the epithelial form with exon IIIb.
Microarray analysis revealed that cell lines classified as epithelial
expressed higher levels of ESRP1 and/or ESRP2 than cell lines classified
as mesenchymal. Depletion of ESRP1 and ESRP2 in a human prostate
epithelial cell line via RNA interference (RNAi) caused a significant
switch from exon IIIb to exon IIIc splicing in the endogenous FGFR2
transcript. Rescue experiments with mouse cDNAs showed that FGFR2-IIIb
splicing was more dependent on ESRP1 than ESRP2. RNAi experiments
revealed that ESRP1 and ESRP2 also regulated splicing of CD44 (107269),
CTNND1 (601045), and ENAH (609061), transcripts that undergo changes in
splicing during the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.

MAPPING

Hartz (2009) mapped the ESRP2 gene to chromosome 16q22.1 based on an
alignment of the ESRP2 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK025571) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

600339	TITLE *600339 HEPATOMA-DERIVED GROWTH FACTOR; HDGF
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Nakamura et al. (1994) purified a novel hepatoma-derived growth factor
from the conditioned medium of human hepatoma-derived cell line HuH-7.
Molecular cloning of a cDNA from the cDNA library of the same cell line
was done on the basis of the N-terminal amino acid sequence. The cDNA
was 2.4 kb long and the deduced amino acid sequence contained 240 amino
acids without a signal peptide-like N-terminal hydrophobic sequence. The
primary sequence shared homology with the high mobility group-1 protein
(163905); they showed 23.4% amino acid identity and 35.6% amino acid
similarity.

GENE FUNCTION

By immunofluorescence study, Nakamura et al. (1994) showed that HDGF is
localized in the cytoplasm of hepatoma cells and northern blots showed
that it is expressed ubiquitously in normal tissues and tumor cell
lines. Nakamura et al. (1994) suggested that it is a novel
heparin-binding protein with mitogenic activity for fibroblasts.

MAPPING

By PCR screening of a commercial monochromosomal hybrid panel, Wanschura
et al. (1996) mapped HDGF to the X chromosome. By FISH, they refined the
localization to Xq25. Subsequently, however, the International Radiation
Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the HDGF gene to chromosome 1 (TMAP
SHGC-132090). Amberger (2007) refined the localization to 1q21 based on
an alignment of the HDGF sequence (GenBank GENBANK D16431) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.2).

188300	TITLE *188300 THYMIDINE KINASE, SOLUBLE; TK1
DESCRIPTION Thymidine kinase (EC 2.7.1.21) catalyzes the phosphorylation of
thymidine to deoxythymidine monophosphate. Genetic variation in soluble
thymidine kinase has not been identified in man. Weiss and Green (1967)
found that fusion of mouse cells lacking this enzyme with normal human
cells could be achieved, that progressive loss of human chromosomes from
the hybrid occurred with passage of time, and that at a stage when only
one human chromosome remained the cell still had the capacity to
synthesize thymidine kinase. The assumption was that the remaining
chromosome, now identified as chromosome 17 (Migeon and Miller, 1968;
Miller et al., 1971), carries the TK locus. Boone et al. (1972)
presented evidence that TK is on the long arm of chromosome 17.
McDougall et al. (1973) showed that adeno-12 virus causes a gap in the
long arm of chromosome 17. Since the adeno-12 virus causes a 2- or
3-fold increase in TK, the gap may represent the TK locus and may be
comparable to a puff. By study of an 11-17 translocation in mouse-man
hybrid cells, Francke and Busby (1974) located the TK locus to the
region distal to q21. In the African green monkey, the thymidine kinase
and galactokinase (604313) loci are both on a chromosome similar to
human E-17 in size, shape and Giemsa banding pattern (Croce et al.,
1974). This is another striking example of chromosomal homology. Lin et
al. (1983) cloned the TK1 gene and estimated its maximal size to be 14
kilobase pairs and its minimal size between 4 and 5 kilobase pairs. The
gene contains many noncoding inserts and numerous Alu sequences.
Nucleotide sequencing indicated considerable evolutionary conservation
of the TK gene; Bradshaw and Deininger (1984) found about 70% homology
between the human and chicken genes. Flemington et al. (1987) sequenced
the entire 12.9-kb human TK gene, along with flanking regions. TK is
composed of 7 exons. Within the introns, 13 Alu family repeated
sequences and a polypyrimidine stretch were found. Sherley and Kelly
(1988) purified and characterized the enzyme from HeLa cells.
Kucherlapati et al. (1974) assigned the TK1 locus to 17q21-q22. By
chromosome-mediated gene transfer (CMGT), Klobutcher and Ruddle (1979)
transferred the genes for thymidine kinase, galactokinase, and type I
procollagen (120150). The data indicated the following gene order:
cen--GALK--(TK1--COL1A1). Studies by vanTuinen and Ledbetter (1987) led
to the conclusion that TK is located in the segment 17q23-qter, which is
consistent with the conclusion of Sparkes et al. (1986). Xu et al.
(1988) mapped the TK locus to 17q23-q25 by in situ hybridization. Xu et
al. (1988) also used CMGT in the generation of a physical map of
chromosome 17. This is an established method of constructing hybrid
cells containing subchromosomal fragments of a selected donor
chromosome. The generation of transfectants for chromosome 17 is helped
by the presence of the selectable marker TK. Xu et al. (1988) generated
a panel of more than 50 transfectants containing different transgenomic
fragments of chromosome 17. By analyzing cotransfection frequencies, Xu
et al. (1988) found groups of loci that are closely situated on
chromosome 17. Their results confirmed, however, that although
substantial lengths of DNA may be transferred intact, interstitial
deletions occur frequently. Furthermore, multiple fragments of
transfected chromatin can be found in the same clone, and there is
selection for centromeric sequences. Their overall results indicated the
following order:
pter--(TP53--POLR2--D17S1)--(MYHSA2--MYHSA1)--D17Z1--CRYB1--
(ERBA1--GCSF--NGL)--acute promyelocytic leukemia
breakpoint--RNU2--HOX2--
(NGFR--COL1A1--MPO)--GAA--UMPH--GHC--TK1--GALK--qter. In the 5-prime
flanking region of the TK gene, Sauve et al. (1990) located the position
of nucleotide sequences that can act as binding sites for transacting
factors as well as potential cis-acting sequences. The latter were
compared with those of the promoter of the human PCNA gene (176740).
Both TK and PCNA are maximally expressed at the G1/S boundary of the
cell cycle.

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Kuo et al. (1996) mapped both GAA
(232300) and the thymidine kinase gene to 17q25.2-q25.3 and showed that
GAA is distal to TK1.

141850	TITLE *141850 HEMOGLOBIN--ALPHA LOCUS 2; HBA2
;;5-PRIME @ALPHA-GLOBIN GENE;;
ALPHA-GLOBIN LOCUS, SECOND;;
MAJOR ALPHA-GLOBIN LOCUS
DESCRIPTION Since at least as early as 1970, 2 alpha loci have been known to exist
in some humans (Brimhall et al., 1970): hemoglobins G (Pest) and J
(Buda) showed the existence of at least 2 alpha chains in the Hungarians
studied (141800.0041, 141850.0008), whereas hemoglobin J (Tongariki)
indicated that in Melanesians only 1 alpha locus exists (141800.0077).
The alpha locus is apparently double in Chinese (Kan, 1974), whereas in
American blacks, chromosomes with single or double alpha loci are about
equally frequent (Huisman, 1974). Rucknagel and Dublin (1974) estimated
that a chromosome with a single alpha locus has a frequency of about
0.27 in American blacks and about 0.36 in African blacks. Rucknagel and
Rising (1975) studied an American black family in which of 5 persons
heterozygous for hemoglobin G (Philadelphia), an alpha-chain mutant, 3
had about 30% Hb G and 2 had 40%. They suggested that the former persons
have 2 alpha hemoglobin loci and the latter persons 1 such locus. Three
members of a Hungarian family had 2 alpha-chain variants (Hb J Buda and
Hb G Pest), each variant accounting for 25% of hemoglobin, the rest
being Hb A (Brimhall et al., 1974). From studies of hemoglobin G
(Philadelphia), Baine et al. (1976) also concluded that there is
variability in the number of alpha-chain genes in the American black
population. In heterozygotes the proportion of Hb G (Philadelphia) was
trimodally distributed with modes at about 20%, 30%, and 40%. The
workers concluded that gene dosage accounts for this: 1 G gene out of 4
alpha genes leads to 20% Hb G; 1 G gene out of 3 alpha genes leads to
30% Hb G; 1 G gene out of 2 alpha genes or 2 G genes out of 4 alpha
genes leads to 40% Hb G. In Melanesians, Eng et al. (1974) observed
homozygous Hb Constant Spring and Hb A. The products of the 2
alpha-chain genes appear to have the same primary structure. Although
there is no direct proof, they are probably closely linked
(Politis-Tsegos et al., 1976). Unequal crossingover may be responsible
for the type of alpha-thalassemia with deleted alpha loci. From study of
Hb J(Mexico) in an Algerian family, Trabuchet et al. (1977) also
concluded that the alpha gene was duplicate in some chromosomes and
single in others. Two types of deletional alpha-plus-thalassemia are
identified by molecular genetic studies. One, termed leftward, shows a
deletion of 4.2 kb and removes the entire alpha-2 gene; the other,
termed rightward, has a deletion of 3.7 kb and gives rise to a hybrid
alpha-2/alpha-1 gene. The 3.7-kb rightward deletion can also remove the
entire alpha-1 gene and is 'possibly the most common mutation known to
produce a genetic disorder' (Bowden et al., 1987). It is prevalent in
most tropical and subtropical populations that have been studied,
including African and American blacks, Mediterraneans, Southeast Asians,
and some Pacific Island populations. In contrast, the 4.2-kb deletion of
the alpha-2 gene is very rare in African blacks and Mediterraneans. The
leftward one was found only in Asian cases until the report of a case in
East Sicily (Troungos et al., 1984).

El-Hazmi (1986) found several persons with the leftward deletion
alpha-thalassemia in Saudi Arabia, including homozygotes and
heterozygotes. Remarkably, in north coastal Papua New Guinea, the 4.2-kb
deletion is found in more than 80% of the population and appears to be
going to fixation (Oppenheimer et al., 1984). From comparison of the
level of hemoglobin Bart's at birth in homozygotes for each of the 2
deletions, Bowden et al. (1987) demonstrated that the alpha-2 gene, when
alone on the chromosome, reduces more alpha-globin than does the alpha-1
gene. (Since hemoglobin Bart's (142309) is a tetramer of gamma chains,
the level of this hemoglobin reflects in an inverse manner the amount of
alpha chains produced.) In a case of alpha-thalassemia, Whitelaw and
Proudfoot (1986) showed that the mutation in the 3-prime poly(A) site
leads to transcription of the mutant alpha-2 globin gene through into
the intergenic sequence past the normal termination site. They
interpreted these results as demonstrating that transcriptional
termination and 3-prime end processing of mRNA are coupled events for
the alpha-2 globin gene. Liebhaber et al. (1986) studied 8 separate
alpha-globin mutants mapped to the alpha-1 or the alpha-2 locus and
demonstrated that the alpha-2 gene encodes 2- to 3-fold more protein
than the alpha-1 gene. These results suggested that the human
alpha-globin cluster contains a major and a minor locus and that
deletions in the alpha-2 gene are more significant in the generation of
the alpha-thalassemia phenotype than are deletions in the alpha-1 gene.

N.B.: Alpha-globin variants for which it is unknown whether HBA1 or HBA2
is involved have been arbitrarily listed under HBA1 (141800).

Straub et al. (2012) reported a model for the regulation of nitric oxide
(NO) signaling by demonstrating that hemoglobin alpha, encoded by the
HBA1 (141800) and HBA2 genes, is expressed in human and mouse arterial
endothelial cells and enriched at the myoendothelial junction, where it
regulates the effects of NO on vascular reactivity. Notably, this
function is unique to hemoglobin alpha and is abrogated by its genetic
depletion. Mechanistically, endothelial hemoglobin alpha heme iron in
the Fe(3+) state permits NO signaling, and this signaling is shut off
when hemoglobin alpha is reduced to the Fe(2+) state by endothelial
cytochrome b5 reductase 3 (CYB5R3; 613213). Genetic and pharmacologic
inhibition of CYB5R3 increased NO bioactivity in small arteries. Straub
et al. (2012) concluded that their data revealed a mechanism by which
the regulation of the intracellular hemoglobin alpha oxidation state
controls nitric oxide synthase (NOS; see 163729) signaling in
nonerythroid cells. The authors suggested that this model may be
relevant to heme-containing globins in a broad range of NOS-containing
somatic cells.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HEMOGLOBIN CONSTANT SPRING
HEMOGLOBIN H DISEASE, NONDELETIONAL, INCLUDED
HBA2, TER142GLN

In this variant hemoglobin, named for the community in Jamaica where it
was first discovered (Clegg et al., 1971), alpha chains have 172 amino
acids rather than the normal 141. Clegg et al. (1971) suggested that
this may reflect a chain termination mutation. Hb Constant Spring
represents 1 to 2% of the hemoglobin of heterozygotes. When combined
with an alpha-thalassemia mutation, Hb H disease (613978) results. It is
the alpha-2 or 5-prime alpha-globin gene that is mutant in hemoglobin
Constant Spring. Hemoglobin Tak (141900.0279) is a termination defect of
the beta chain.

Hunt and Dayhoff (1972) searched 518 known protein sequences for a
31-amino acid sequence with the largest number of identities to that of
the extra piece on hemoglobin Constant Spring. The sequence that had the
greatest identity (9 amino acids) was the region 68-98 of the normal
alpha chain. See hemoglobin Wayne (141850.0004) for further discussion.

By use of allele-specific oligonucleotide probes, Kosasih et al. (1988)
demonstrated that Hb Constant Spring in a Batak Indonesian family was
due to replacement of T by C in the TAA terminal codon of the
alpha-2-globin gene, changing it to CAA, the codon for glutamine. This
resulted in read-through of the untranslated sequence of the mRNA.

Hsia et al. (1989) described a sensitive and specific DNA-based
screening test for improved detection of the Constant Spring variant
using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and allele-specific
oligonucleotide slot-blot hybridization. Since the Constant Spring
protein is difficult to detect by electrophoresis, Hsia et al. (1989)
suspected that the true incidence of the Constant Spring variant may be
greater than previously suspected on the basis of protein
electrophoresis.

Laig et al. (1990) found Hb CS gene frequencies between 0.05 and 0.06 in
northeastern Thailand. The Lao-speaking populations of the Mekong River
basin were found to have the highest frequencies of the gene in
Southeast Asia.

To identify nondeletion types of Hb H disease in Guangxi, China, Wen et
al. (1992) designed 3 primers: one specific for HBA1 DNA, another
specific for HBA2 DNA, and a third that was common to the 2. In 27 of 59
Hb H cases (45.8%), it was possible to confirm the disorder as
nondeletional in type. Of these, 22 (81.5%) had the Hb Constant Spring
mutation and one had the Hb Quong Sze mutation (141850.0005). The
nondeletion Hb H disease in Guangxi seemed to be more severe than the
deletion types.

.0002
HEMOGLOBIN ICARIA
HEMOGLOBIN H DISEASE, NONDELETIONAL, INCLUDED
HBA2, TER142LYS

Abnormally long alpha chain. Lysine is the 142nd amino acid. Glutamine
is the corresponding amino acid in the abnormally long alpha chain of Hb
Constant Spring (141850.0001), which like Hb Icaria is the result of a
terminator mutation (Clegg et al., 1974). The mutation is a TAA-to-AAA
change in codon 142 of the alpha-2 chain, converting it from 'stop' to
lysine. In a Yugoslavian teenager with moderate anemia with severe
microcytosis and hypochromia and 16% Hb H, Efremov et al. (1990)
identified the TAA-to-AAA mutation at codon 142 of the alpha-2 globin
gene. The patient also had an alpha-thalassemia-1 deletion of about 20.5
kb, common in Mediterranean populations. The one remaining alpha-1
globin gene was apparently able to compensate sufficiently for the loss
of the 3 alpha-globin genes to maintain a hemoglobin level of 8-9 g/dl.

The interaction of Hb Icaria with the Mediterranean type of alpha
thalassemia resulted in severe Hb H disease (613978); splenectomy
resulted in marked amelioration of clinical features (Kanavakis et al.,
1996).

.0003
HEMOGLOBIN KOYA DORA
HBA2, TER142SER

Excessive length of alpha-like chain (with at least 156 amino acids
rather than 141). De Jong et al. (1975) found that about 10% of members
of the Koya Dora tribe in Andhra Pradesh, India, carry this variant
hemoglobin. They found 2 persons with 2 alpha chain variants, Hb Rampa
and Hb Koya Dora, plus normal Hb A. This indicates that this population
carries 2 alpha chain loci. Hb Koya Dora resembles Hb Constant Spring
(141850.0001) in many respects including its alpha-thalassemia-like
expression. Serine is substituted at position 142 of the alpha-2 chain
(glutamine in Hb Constant Spring and lysine in Hb Icaria).

.0004
HEMOGLOBIN WAYNE
HBA2, LYS139ASN

Two hemoglobins, Hb W1 and Hb W2, with anomalous alpha chains were
observed in several members of a family. The alpha T-14 peptide was
replaced by a new peptide which was different in the 2. The sequence in
Hb A which was missing was thr-ser-lys-tyr-arg-COOH. In W1 it was
replaced by thr-ser-asn-thr-val-lys-leu-glu-pro-arg-COOH. Hb W2 had the
same peptide except that aspartic acid had been substituted for
asparagine in the third position. This was believed to represent the
result of enzymatic deamidation of Hb W1. This was the first reported
frameshift mutation in man. Deletion of a single nucleotide yields the
sequence observed in Hb W1. If the usual nucleotide sequence in the
alpha chain gene is ACX.UCX.AAA(G).UAC.CGU.UAA signifying
thr-ser-lys-tyr-arg-terminator, then hemoglobin Wayne has had a deletion
of the third nucleotide of codon 139 resulting in frameshift to
ACX.UCX.AAU.ACC.GUU.AAG.CUG.GAG etc., which reads
thr-ser-asn-thr-val-lys-leu-glu-etc. This interpretation agrees with
that for hemoglobin Constant Spring (141850.0001), which appears to be a
change in the first nucleotide of the terminator codon so that the above
sequence becomes ACX.UCX.AAA.UAC.CGU.CAA.GCU.GGA etc., which is read as
thr-ser-lys-tyr-arg-gln-ala-gly-etc. The mutation in Hb Wayne is in the
alpha-2 gene. See Seid-Akhavan et al. (1976) and Stamatoyannopoulos et
al. (1980). In a Canadian family of Scandinavian descent, Salkie et al.
(1992) described Hb Wayne in a mother and all of her 4 children.

.0005
HEMOGLOBIN QUONG SZE
HBA2, LEU125PRO

Goossens et al. (1982) described another nondeletion mechanism: mutation
in the 125th codon of the alpha-2 gene resulted in substitution of
proline for leucine in a region of the H helix of the alpha-globin
chain, which is critical for alpha-beta contact, resulting in impediment
to alpha-beta dimer formation, the initial step in hemoglobin tetramer
assembly. Thus, the alpha-thalassemia phenotype results from a novel
posttranslational mechanism. Goossens et al. (1982) named the mutant
Quong Sze, after the province in China where the mother of their proband
was born. Liang et al. (1991) reported a second example of this mutation
in a Chinese family in Guangxi (Quong Sze). Hb Quong Sze is a highly
unstable alpha-chain variant; because the abnormal alpha chains are
rapidly catabolized, the abnormal hemoglobin is difficult to detect in
reticulocytes. Identification was made through gene analysis.

.0006
HEMOGLOBIN EVANS
HBA2, VAL62MET

In the alpha-2 chain of hemoglobin from a Caucasian female with mild
hemolytic anemia, Wilson et al. (1989) demonstrated substitution of
methionine for valine at position 62. Dot-blot analysis of amplified DNA
using synthetic oligonucleotide probes confirmed the suspected G-to-A
mutation in the first position of codon 62; GTG was changed to ATG.

.0007
HEMOGLOBIN SUAN-DOK
HBA2, LEU109ARG

See Sanguansermsri et al. (1979). Hb Suan-Dok has an
alpha-thalassemia-like effect due to low production and instability of
the altered alpha-globin chain. Since the mutation (CTG to CGG) creates
a new SmaI restriction site, Hundrieser et al. (1990) diagnosed the
mutation by restriction analysis. Furthermore, they confirmed location
of the mutation in the HBA2 gene. The hemoglobin was identified in a
family from the province of Lampang in Northern Thailand. Weiss et al.
(1990) concluded that the thalassemia associated with the Suan-Dok
mutation results from instability of the mutant alpha-globin.

Regtuijt et al. (2004) described Hb Suan-Dok in a 58-year-old black
female from Curacao (West Indies) with persistent microcytic hypochromic
anemia.

.0008
HEMOGLOBIN J (BUDA)
ERYTHROCYTOSIS
HBA2, LYS61ASN

Hb J (Buda) and Hb G (Pest) (141800.0041), both alpha-chain mutants,
occurred together in a Hungarian male with erythrocytosis. The
occurrence of some normal Hb A in this man showed the existence of at
least 2 alpha loci. See Hollan et al. (1972) and Brimhall et al. (1974).
By selectively amplifying the alpha-1 and alpha-2-globin cDNAs and
hybridizing them to allele-specific oligonucleotides, Mamalaki et al.
(1990) demonstrated that the J-Buda variant has a change in the alpha-2
gene, namely, a change from AAG to AAC in codon 61.

.0009
HEMOGLOBIN SPANISH TOWN
HBA2, GLU27VAL

See Ahern et al. (1976). Cash et al. (1989) demonstrated that the
Spanish Town mutation is located in the HBA2 gene.

.0010
HEMOGLOBIN J (OXFORD)
HEMOGLOBIN I (INTERLAKEN);;
HEMOGLOBIN N (COSENZA)
HBA2, GLY15ASP

See Liddell et al. (1964), Marti et al. (1964), Silvestroni et al.
(1967), and Harano et al. (1984). This is a mutation of the HBA2 gene
(Cash et al., 1989).

.0011
HEMOGLOBIN I
HEMOGLOBIN I (BURLINGTON);;
HEMOGLOBIN I (PHILADELPHIA);;
HEMOGLOBIN I (SKAMANIA);;
HEMOGLOBIN I (TEXAS)
HBA2, LYS16GLU

The hemoglobin I mutation is curious in that it is encoded at both the
HBA1 locus (see 141800.0055) and at the HBA2 locus (Liebhaber et al.,
1984). This is presumably an example of gene conversion.

.0012
HEMOGLOBIN L (FERRARA)
HEMOGLOBIN HASHARON;;
HEMOGLOBIN SINAI;;
HEMOGLOBIN SEALY
HBA2, ASP47HIS

See Silvestroni et al. (1960, 1960), Bianco et al. (1963), Halbrecht et
al. (1967), Ostertag and Smith (1968), Charache et al. (1969), Nagel et
al. (1969), Lehmann and Vella (1974), Tentori (1977), and Pich et al.
(1978). The family in which hemoglobin Sealy was found was Ashkenazi
(Schneider et al., 1968). (Hemoglobin Beilinson was also found in an
Ashkenazi Jewish family and has a substitution of glycine for aspartic
acid at alpha 47.) See Benesch et al. (1982). This is a mutation of the
HBA2 gene (Cash et al., 1989).

.0013
HEMOGLOBIN MONTGOMERY
HEMOGLOBIN BIRMINGHAM (USA)
HBA2, LEU48ARG

See Brimhall et al. (1975), Huisman et al. (1980), and Mrad et al.
(1988). The designation of this hemoglobin was changed to Hb Montgomery
when it was discovered that Hb Birmingham had already been used for an
alpha variant hemoglobin from Birmingham, England (Hb J Birmingham)
(Schneider, 1974). This is a mutation of the HBA2 gene (Cash et al.,
1989).

.0014
HEMOGLOBIN G (BRISTOL)
HEMOGLOBIN D (BALTIMORE);;
HEMOGLOBIN D (ST. LOUIS);;
HEMOGLOBIN D (WASHINGTON);;
HEMOGLOBIN G (AZAKUOLI);;
HEMOGLOBIN G (KNOXVILLE);;
HEMOGLOBIN G (PHILADELPHIA);;
HEMOGLOBIN KNOXVILLE-1;;
HEMOGLOBIN STANLEYVILLE-I
HBA2, ASN68LYS

See Dherte et al. (1959), Atwater et al. (1960), Raper et al. (1960),
Baglioni and Ingram (1961), Gammack et al. (1961), Huehns and Shooter
(1961), McCurdy et al. (1961), Minnich et al. (1962), Weatherall et al.
(1962), Dance et al. (1964), Chernoff and Pettit (1965), Schroeder and
Jones (1965), Sancar et al. (1980), Surrey et al. (1980), Brudzdinski et
al. (1984), and Morle et al. (1984). This is a mutation of the HBA2 gene
(Cash et al., 1989).

.0015
HEMOGLOBIN INKSTER
HBA2, ASP85VAL

See Reed et al. (1974). This is a mutation of the HBA2 gene (Cash et
al., 1989).

Aguinaga et al. (2000) found the same hemoglobin variant in a nonsmoking
49-year-old Caucasian male who presented with polycythemia. The authors
stated that this was the first report of Hb Inkster associated with
polycythemia in a patient with an otherwise unexplained erythrocytosis.

(Polycythemia, erythrocytosis, and erythemia are synonyms meaning
increased red blood cell mass. Authors use the terms interchangeably,
although erythemia is now almost obsolete.)

.0016
HEMOGLOBIN COLUMBIA MISSOURI
HBA2, ALA88VAL

In a 22-year-old white man who was undergoing assessment for
erythrocytosis, Perry et al. (1991) found a hemoglobin variant resulting
from substitution of valine for alanine-88 in the alpha-2 chain.

.0017
HEMOGLOBIN SUN PRAIRIE
HBA2, ALA130PRO

Harkness et al. (1990) and Plaseska et al. (1990) identified this
variant hemoglobin in an Asiatic Indian child and an Asiatic Indian
adult, respectively. The child was apparently homozygous for a G-to-C
mutation in codon 130 of the alpha-2-globin gene resulting in marked
microcytosis and hypochromia. The patient reported by Plaseska et al.
(1990) was heterozygous. The change at codon 130 was GCT-to-CCT.

Ho et al. (1996) found Hb Sun Prairie in an Asian-Indian family in which
2 daughters were homozygous for this unstable alpha-2-globin variant.
They showed chronic hemolysis, whereas the heterozygous parents were
asymptomatic with a thalassemia carrier phenotype, distinct from the
chronic hemolytic state previously described in a heterozygote. Unlike
the earlier cases in which family studies were not available, this
family clearly exhibited autosomal recessive inheritance, unusual among
variants within the same region of helix H. Globin chain biosynthesis
ratios initially suggested a beta-thalassemic hemoglobinopathy; this was
excluded by normal sequence analysis of both beta-globin genes.

Sarkar et al. (2005) studied the effects of coinheritance of the Hb Sun
Prairie mutation with a point mutation in the 5-prime UTR on the same
HBA2 chromosome in both heterozygous and homozygous states in the
eastern Indian population. Depression of translation because of the
second mutation of a conserved base in the 5-prime UTR was thought to
account for clinical severity.

.0018
HEMOGLOBIN BOYLE HEIGHTS
HBA2, ASP6DEL

See Johnson et al. (1981, 1983). Hb Boyle Heights was originally
observed in an adult Mexican male. Zhao et al. (1990) observed it in a
Caucasian family living in South Carolina. They demonstrated that the
mutation is in the major alpha-globin gene, Hb A(2).

.0019
HEMOGLOBIN DAVENPORT
HBA2, ASN78HIS

Wilson et al. (1990) found a new, stable alpha-chain variant in 2
members of a Caucasian family living in Iowa. Hematologic data were
within normal limits. The hemoglobin moved between Hb A and Hb F in
isoelectric focusing (IEF) and eluted slightly faster than Hb A2 in
cation exchange HPLC. The family was of German descent. Replacement of
asparagine by histidine at position 78 was identified.

.0020
ALPHA-THALASSEMIA
HBA2, MET1THR

Pirastu et al. (1984) demonstrated that a nondeletion form of
alpha-thalassemia was due to an initiation codon mutation (AUG to ACG)
changing methionine to threonine.

Ayala et al. (1996) studied 10 Spanish families with nondeletional
alpha-thalassemia. In 9, they identified a 5-bp deletion at the donor
site of IVS1; in 1 case, they identified the ATG-to-ACG transition in
the initiation codon.

.0021
ALPHA-THALASSEMIA
HBA2, GLU116TER

In an American black woman with alpha-thalassemia, Liebhaber et al.
(1987) demonstrated a premature termination mutation at codon 116 (GAG
to UAG) changing a glu residue to 'stop.'

.0022
HEMOGLOBIN H DISEASE, NONDELETIONAL
HBA2, MET1VAL

In a family ascertained on the basis of hemoglobin H disease (613978),
Olivieri et al. (1987) found a new nondeletion form of alpha-thalassemia
mutation, an A-to-G substitution in the initiation codon of the HBA2
gene that changed methionine to valine. This mutation abolished an NcoI
restriction site and was therefore detectable in genomic DNA by Southern
blot analysis.

.0023
HEMOGLOBIN HANAMAKI
HBA2, LYS139GLU

In a 56-year-old Japanese female who by HPLC appeared to have an
abnormally high level of Hb A(1c), Orisaka et al. (1992) found a
lys139-to-glu mutation. The mother and 1 of 3 brothers also had the
abnormal hemoglobin. The mutation in Hb Tokoname (141800.0149) resides
in the same codon. The oxygen affinity properties of the 2 hemoglobins
are similar. A second case of Hb Hanamaki was described by Rahbar et al.
(1994) in an American family with erythrocytosis.

.0024
ALPHA-THALASSEMIA-2, NONDELETIONAL
HEMOGLOBIN H DISEASE, NONDELETIONAL, INCLUDED
HBA2, 3-UNT, A-G, +4

In a large family from southern Turkey, Yuregir et al. (1992) observed
nondeletional alpha-thalassemia-2 resulting from an A-to-G mutation at
nucleotide 4 in the polyadenylation signal of the HBA2 gene: AATAAA to
AATGAA. The same A-to-G replacement was present in the alpha-1
pseudogene. The mutation must cause a considerable alpha-chain
deficiency as evidenced by the hematologic data in 5 members of a family
with Hb H disease (613978) due to compound heterozygosity for
alpha-thalassemia-1 and the newly discovered poly(A) mutation.

.0025
HEMOGLOBIN KURDISTAN
HBA2, ASP47TYR

Giordano et al. (1994) reported a new alpha chain variant (Hb Kurdistan)
in a 15-year-old Kurdish refugee girl and her family from Amdea, Iraq.
Amplification and DNA analysis of both alpha genes indicated an
asp-to-tyr substitution (GAC-to-TAC) at position 47 of the HBA2 gene.
Replacement with the larger aromatic side chain of tyrosine at this
position does not induce any significant instability in the hemoglobin
molecule. In the proband's brother, this variant was associated with a
beta-thalassemia nonsense mutation at codon 39.

.0026
HEMOGLOBIN AGRINIO
HEMOGLOBIN H DISEASE, NONDELETIONAL, INCLUDED
HBA2, LEU29PRO

Hb Agrinio was discovered by Hall et al. (1993) in 3 individuals of
Greek origin with an atypical form of Hb H disease (613978)
characterized by a severe hypochromic, microcytic anemia. Hall et al.
(1993) indicated that the mutation consisted of a T-to-C transition in
codon 29 of the HBA2 gene causing a leucine-to-proline transition.
Although each affected individual was a compound heterozygote for Hb
Agrinio and a previously described mutation affecting the poly(A)
addition signal of the HBB gene (141900.0383), simple heterozygotes for
the leu29-to-pro mutation have the phenotype of the alpha-thalassemia
trait.

Traeger-Synodinos et al. (1998) reported the first case of homozygosity
for Hb Agrinio. The leu29-to-pro amino acid substitution in
alpha-2-globin was caused by a CTG-to-CCG transition. The 12-month-old
Greek proband presented with marked hypochromic microcytic anemia, a
very low level of Hb H, rare Hb H inclusions, and a balanced
alpha/non-alpha biosynthesis ratio. At the age of 13 years, the proband
had a clinical phenotype compatible with mild thalassemia intermedia
with moderate anemia (Hb = 7-8 g/dL), normal growth and development,
slight splenomegaly, and minimal bone changes, while Hb H and inclusion
bodies were not detected.

.0027
HEMOGLOBIN PAKSE
HEMOGLOBIN H DISEASE, NONDELETIONAL, INCLUDED
HBA2, TER142TYR

In a Laotian girl with hemoglobin H disease (613978), Waye et al. (1994)
found a TAA-to-TAT mutation converting the termination codon to a
tyrosine residue. The mutation gave rise to an elongated mRNA that would
code for an alpha-globin chain of 172 amino acid residues instead of the
normal 141 residues. The proband's father also carried the mutation. The
proband was a compound heterozygote for the Southeast Asian
alpha-thalassemia-1 deletion and the novel termination codon mutation.
Four previous mutations involving the termination codon of the
alpha-2-globin gene had been reported: Hb Constant Spring (141850.0001);
Hb Icaria (141850.0002); Hb Koya Dora (141850.0003); and Hb Seal Rock
(141850.0028).

.0028
HEMOGLOBIN SEAL ROCK
HBA2, TER142GLU

Hemoglobin Seal Rock carries a TAA-to-GAA mutation that converts the
termination codon of the HBA2 gene to glu (Bradley et al., 1975; Bunn
and Forget, 1986). Like 4 other mutations in the termination codon of
the HBA2 gene, the mutant allele codes for an alpha-chain variant of 172
amino acid residues that result in unstable elongated mRNA molecules.

.0029
HEMOGLOBIN ANAMOSA
HBA2, ALA111VAL

So-called 'silent' hemoglobin variants are characterized by the
replacement of an amino acid with one having a similar charge. These are
usually detected by separations in isoelectric focusing or HPLC because
of differences in hydrophobicity. The substitution occasionally may
affect the function of physicochemical properties of the variant to
determine the clinical or hematologic condition of its carrier. Kazanetz
et al. (1995) identified an ala111-to-val substitution in the core
peptide of HBA2 due to a change from GCC to GTC. The variant was
discovered in a Caucasian baby born in the Anamosa Community Hospital in
Anamosa, Iowa, and in his father. Stability tests on all red cell
lysates gave negative results, indicating stability of the variant
hemoglobin.

.0030
HEMOGLOBIN BIBBA
HBA2, LEU136PRO

In a large Caucasian family, Prchal et al. (1995) found that members
with congenital Heinz body hemolytic anemia were carriers of Hb Bibba.
Instability of the variant complicated isolation of the protein from
shipped blood samples. The mutation at codon 136 of the alpha-2 gene
resulted in a change from CTG to CCG and a leu136-to-pro substitution.
The first Hb Bibba heterozygote, characterized in 1968 by Kleihauer et
al. (1968), was believed to be a member of this family. The clinical
expression of the disease was surprisingly variable in severity.
Affected persons in 4 generations of the Alabama family had been
observed. (Please note that the mutation here is located in the HBA2
gene rather than in the HBA1 gene, as previously indicated in
141800.0011.)

.0031
HEMOGLOBIN SALLANCHES
HEMOGLOBIN H DISEASE, NONDELETIONAL, INCLUDED
HBA2, CYS104TYR

Morle et al. (1995) found homozygosity for a mutation in the HBA2 gene
resulting in hemolytic anemia associated with a low level of hemoglobin
H. The mutation was a TGC-to-TAC transition involving codon 104 and
resulting in replacement of a cysteine by tyrosine. In vitro and in vivo
biosynthetic studies suggested that the mechanism leading to Hb H
disease (613978) in this homozygous patient was related mostly to a
significant instability of the dimers between normal beta chains and
variant alpha chains.

Khan et al. (2000) identified Hb Sallanches in a Pakistani family having
3 homozygous patients with transfusion-dependent Hb H disease. The 2
previous reports had been of a French patient and a West Indian patient.
The Pakistani cases were thought to have originated as an independent
mutation.

.0032
ALPHA-THALASSEMIA TRAIT
HBA2, 9-BP DEL/8-BP INS

Efstratiadis et al. (1980) suggested that slipped strand mispairing
(SSM) is enhanced by short (2 to 8) direct repeats, which may induce
short deletions in mammalian DNA. SSM was later suggested to play an
important in the expansion of trinucleotide repeats, causing
neurodegenerative disorders such as spinocerebellar ataxia and
Huntington disease. In addition, the size variation of microsatellite
repeats, such as polymorphic markers, is also thought to result from
SSM. SSM probably also leads to the variability in microsatellite
repeats seen in tumor cells, reflecting the high degree of genomic
instability in those tissues. Thus, SSM appears to be occur both in
germline and in somatic cells. Slippage of the replication fork is not
in itself sufficient to explain the more complex mutations in which
small deletions are combined with insertions. Oron-Karni et al. (1997)
described a deletion/duplication mutation in the HBA2 gene that allowed
them to formulate a novel mechanism accounting for the generation of
this mutation, as well as a number of other human mutations. They found
a deletion of 9 bp (codons 39 to 41), which was replaced by a nucleotide
insertion, duplicating the adjacent downstream sequence. They proposed
that the mutation arose by SSM, creating a single-stranded loop,
followed by DNA elongation, strand breathing, and the formation of a
mismatch bubble. They found in the literature 6 additional
deletion/insertion mutations in humans in which the inserted nucleotides
came from the same DNA strand. Their model explained all 6 mutations,
suggesting that rearrangement of a mismatch loop or bubble during DNA
replication may be not uncommon. The patients in whom they made their
initial observations were 2 unrelated individuals of Yemenite-Jewish
origin, referred for evaluation of unexplained mild microcytic anemia.
The hematologic data were compatible with alpha-thalassemia trait.
Because of the rarity of the mutation and the fact that it had been
found only in the 2 individuals of Yemenite-Jewish origin, The subjects
may have had a common ancestor.

.0033
HEMOGLOBIN NATAL
HBA2, TYR140TER

See Jogessar et al. (1988). This variant resulted from a TAC
(tyr)-to-TAA (stop) transversion in codon 140 of the alpha-globin gene.

.0034
HEMOGLOBIN WATTS
HBA2, 3-BP DEL, ASP74DEL OR ASP75DEL

Rahbar et al. (1997) described the first example of a trinucleotide
deletion in the HBA2 gene. In a Mexican-American family, they found that
a slightly unstable alpha-chain hemoglobin variant was due to deletion
of an aspartic acid residue through the deletion of GAC at codon 74 or
codon 75 of the HBA2 gene.

.0035
HEMOGLOBIN CONAKRY
HBA2, LEU80VAL

Cohen-Solal et al. (1998) studied a Guinean woman who was heterozygous
for hemoglobin S and had episodes of marked anemia, repeated typical
metaphyseal painful crises, and hemosiderosis. Her sickling syndrome
resulted from the association of Hb S trait with a severe pyruvate
kinase (PK) deficiency (266200) leading to a 2,3-diphosphoglycerate
(DPG) concentration of twice normal. Sequencing of the PKLR gene
revealed a previously undescribed mutation within exon 5: a 2670C-A
transversion, leading to a ser130-to-tyr amino acid substitution
(609712.0010), which the authors referred to as 'PK Conakry.' In
addition, the patient carried a new hemoglobin variant, leu80 to val,
referred to as 'Hb Conakry,' which seemed to have a mild effect. The
high intraerythrocytic 2,3-DPG concentration induced by the PK
deficiency resulted in a decreased oxygen affinity which favored
sickling to a level almost similar to that of S/C compound heterozygous
patients.

.0036
HEMOGLOBIN J (SARDEGNA)
HBA2, HIS50ASP

See Tangheroni et al. (1968) and Manca and Masala (1989).

Paleari et al. (1999) provided molecular characterization of hemoglobin
J (Sardegna), which is particularly widespread in northern Sardinia.
They characterized the variant at the DNA level as a change of codon 50
of the HBA2 gene from CAC to AAC, predicting a his-to-asn substitution.
Protein analysis, however, showed a his-to-asp substitution in the same
position. A possible explanation for these findings is that a C-to-A
mutation caused the substitution of his for asn, and that the new asn
residue subsequently underwent a posttranslational partial deamidation
to asp. Indeed, Paleari et al. (1999) identified both the asp and the
asn forms of Hb J (Sardegna).

In addition to J (Sardegna), 6 other rare Hb variants had been reported
in which deamidation of an asn residue to an asp occurred as a
spontaneous posttranslational modification: Hb J (Singapore)
(141800.0075), Hb La Roche-sur-Yon (141900.0482), Hb Osler
(141900.0211), Hb Providence (141900.0227), Hb Redondo (141900.0404),
and Hb Wayne (141850.0004).

.0037
HEMOGLOBIN TARRANT
HBA2, ASP126ASN

Perea et al. (1999) provided the molecular characterization of a
hemoglobin variant in a Mexican family. Located in the HBA2 gene, an
asp126-to-asn amino acid substitution resulted in a variant with high
oxygen affinity. Previously described in 4 families with Mexican
ancestors, the variant was known as Hb Tarrant (Moo-Penn et al., 1977).

.0038
HEMOGLOBIN ANTANANARIVO
HBA2, VAL1GLY

During a systematic hematologic study, Kister et al. (1999) identified a
val1-to-gly mutation in the HBA2 gene in a 24-year-old woman who came
from Madagascar. The mutation is a clinically silent variant in which
the structural modification disturbs the oxygen-linked chloride binding.

.0039
HEMOGLOBIN BOGHE
HBA2, HIS58GLN

Lacan et al. (1999) found Hb Boghe in a 12-month-old girl who was
treated for malignant histiocytosis at 9 months of age and received a
bone marrow transplant from her sister. Hb Boghe was undetectable by
isoelectrofocusing and high performance liquid chromatography of
hemoglobins. It was only revealed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
of globin chains in the presence of urea-Triton X-100 and accounted for
10% of the total hemoglobin. The amino acid change resulted from a
CAC-to-CAA mutation in codon 58.

.0040
HEMOGLOBIN TOULON
HBA2, PRO77HIS

In 2 apparently unrelated diabetic women living in different parts of
France, Badens et al. (1999) found a hemoglobin variant during
chromatographic measurement of glycated Hb. Codon 77 of the HBA2 gene
was found to be changed from CCC (pro) to CAC (his).

Waye et al. (2000) reported a second instance of Hb Toulon in a Canadian
family of Italian descent.

Caruso et al. (2002) described what they referred to as the first
Italian case of Hb Toulon.

.0041
HEMOGLOBIN CAMPINAS
HBA2, ALA26VAL

Wenning et al. (2000) identified an electrophoretically silent
hemoglobin variant in a healthy 9-year-old Caucasian Brazilian boy and
his mother. The variant, which the authors called Hb Campinas, was a
single base substitution at codon 26 of the alpha-2 globin gene: GCG
(ala) to GTG (val).

.0042
HEMOGLOBIN NIKAIA
HBA2, HIS20ASP

Prehu et al. (2000) identified Hb Nikaia, a CAC-to-GAC change in the
HBA2 gene resulting in a his20-to-asp substitution, in a 50-year-old
French Caucasian man during measurement of glycated hemoglobin. The name
of the variant was derived from the ancient Greek name of the city of
Nice.

.0043
HEMOGLOBIN CLINICO-MADRID
HBA2, LYS90ARG

In a newborn in Madrid, Spain, Villegas et al. (2000) found an A-to-G
transition in exon 2 of the HBA2 gene, changing codon 90 from AAG (lys)
to AGG (arg).

.0044
HEMOGLOBIN CLINICO-MADRID
HEMOGLOBIN H DISEASE, NONDELETIONAL, INCLUDED
HBA2, IVS2AS, G-A, -1

In an Argentinian patient with Hb H disease (613978) and her daughter,
Noguera et al. (2001) found a splice acceptor consensus point mutation
changing AG to AA in intron 2. Their patient was of Arab and Italian
ancestry. The phenotypic expression observed in the heterozygote, namely
microcytic erythrocytes, slightly hypochromic, was rather more severe
than in individuals with a deleted gene. This observation was thought to
be in accord with the fact that the mutation affects HBA2, whose level
of expression is 3 times higher than that of the HBA1 gene.

.0045
HEMOGLOBIN DARTMOUTH
HBA2, LEU66PRO

McBride et al. (2001) reported a mutation in monozygotic twins and
designated it Hb Dartmouth, after the medical center at which the
patients were cared for. The mother, of Khmer ancestry, was heterozygous
for alpha-thalassemia-1 due to deletion of both HBA1 and HBA2, common in
Southeast Asians. The father, of Scottish-Irish ancestry, was a silent
carrier of a leu66-to-pro mutation of the HBA2 gene. The twins had
severe neonatal anemia requiring transfusion and were compound
heterozygotes for the 2 mutations.

.0046
HEMOGLOBIN GERLAND
HBA2, VAL55ALA

In studies of a 6-year-old boy with mild microcytic anemia, Lacan et al.
(2001) found a neutral alpha-chain variant involving the HBA2 gene and
designated it Hb Gerland. A GTT-to-GCT mutation of codon 55 was
predicted to result in a substitution of alanine for valine.

.0047
HEMOGLOBIN MANITOBA
HBA2, SER102ARG

Hb Manitoba (ser102 to arg) was discovered in a Canadian family by
Crookston et al. (1970) and was subsequently found in an Italian patient
by Sciarratta et al. (1984). Chang et al. (2001) observed the same
variant for the first time in an Asian family in Taiwan.

.0048
HEMOGLOBIN PARK RIDGE
HBA2, ASN9LYS

In an apparently well, 6-month-old Caucasian child, Hoyer et al. (2002)
found an AAC-to-AAG transversion in codon 9 of the HBA2 gene resulting
in an asn9-to-lys (N9K) change. Hb Delfzicht (141800.0208) has the same
mutation in the HBA1 gene.

.0049
HEMOGLOBIN NORTON
HBA2, HIS72ASP

In a 7-month-old Caucasian child who was apparently well and
hematologically normal, Hoyer et al. (2002) found a his72-to-asp
mutation in the alpha-2 chain. Three other alpha-chain variants had been
reported at this site with no apparent abnormality: Hb Gouda
(141800.0198), Hb Fuchu-I (141800.0196), and Hb Daneshgah-Tehran
(141800.0026). Hoyer et al. (2002) stated that 4 previously reported
beta chain variants with substitution of his77 in the beta-globin chain
likewise appeared to be without hematologic effect.

.0050
HEMOGLOBIN LOMBARD
HBA2, HIS103TYR

In a 34-year-old male of Italian (Calabrian) ancestry who was clinically
well and without hematologic abnormality, Hoyer et al. (2002) described
a CAC-to-TAC transition in codon 103 of the HBA2 gene, resulting in a
his103-to-tyr substitution. The same mutation had been reported in the
HBA1 gene as Hb Charolles (141800.0203) in a person of Sardinian origin,
who also had microcytosis that may have been due to mutation of the
3-prime polyadenylation site of the HBA2 gene.

.0051
HEMOGLOBIN SAN ANTONIO
HBA2, LEU113ARG

In a 1-year-old Caucasian male who was asymptomatic and hematologically
normal, Hoyer et al. (2002) found a CTC-to-CGC transversion in codon 113
of the HBA2 gene resulting in a leu113-to-arg (L113R) change.

.0052
HEMOGLOBIN RAMPA
HBA2, PRO95SER

Hb Rampa, a pro95-to-ser (P95S) change in the HBA2 gene, was first
described in a few members of the Koya Dora tribe of Andhra Pradesh,
India (De Jong et al., 1971). Additional cases were reported in a person
of north European origin (Smith et al., 1972) and a French-Canadian
family (Huisman et al., 1978). Hoyer et al. (2002) described Hb Rampa in
a 53-year-old asymptomatic male of German ancestry living in the United
States.

.0053
HEMOGLOBIN MANAWATU
HBA2, PRO37LEU

Brennan et al. (2002) described Hb Manawatu, a pro37-to-leu (P37L)
variant of the HBA2 gene, in a 28-year-old female of British descent
living in New Zealand who was heterozygous for a CCC-to-CTC transition.
The authors stated that the only other recorded mutation at position
alpha-37(C2) was Hb Bourmedes, a pro37-to-arg (P37R; 141800.0012) change
in the HBA1 gene.

.0054
HEMOGLOBIN G (HONOLULU)
HEMOGLOBIN G (HONG KONG);;
HEMOGLOBIN G (SINGAPORE);;
HEMOGLOBIN G (CHINESE)
HBA2, GLU30GLN

See Schneider and Jim (1961), Lehmann (1962), Swenson et al. (1962), and
Lie-Injo et al. (1979). The original Hb G (Chinese) variant was thought
to have a beta-chain substitution (Gammack et al., 1961).

Chang et al. (2002) observed this variant in a Taiwanese family and
found that it was caused by a G-to-C substitution at the first base of
codon 30 (GAG-to-CAG) of the HBA2 gene, resulting in the substitution of
a glutamic acid residue by glutamine (E30Q). The mutation created a PstI
restriction site and abolished an authentic BstNI site.

Shih et al. (2003) identified Hb G (Chinese) with alpha-thalassemia-1 of
the Thai type in a Taiwanese family.

.0055
HEMOGLOBIN PRATO
HBA2, ARG31SER

Marinucci et al. (1979) described this hemoglobin variant in a family of
Sicilian origin living in Prato (near Florence in northern Italy). De
Marco et al. (1992) found Hb Prato in a Calabrian family. The
replacement of the arginine residue by serine occurs at position 31
(arg31 to ser; R31S) of the alpha-2-globin chain. Shih et al. (2003)
observed this variant in a Taiwanese individual who was a compound
heterozygote for Hb Prato and alpha-thalassemia.

.0056
ALPHA-THALASSEMIA, DUTCH TYPE
HBA2, IVS1, A-G, -116

Harteveld et al. (1996) described an IVS1-116A-G acceptor splice site
mutation in the HBA2 gene, causing a very mild alpha(+)-thalassemia
phenotype, in 2 Dutch families.

Harteveld et al. (2003) reported a third independent case of this
alpha-thalassemia point mutation in a healthy 23-year-old Dutch woman;
this was the first case defining the phenotype in combination with a
frequent alpha(+)-thalassemia deletion defect.

.0057
ALPHA-THALASSEMIA, ZF TYPE
HBA2, METHYLATION SILENCING DUE TO ANTISENSE TRANSCRIPT

Barbour et al. (2000) reported an individual (called ZF) with
alpha-thalassemia due to a unique deletion (called alpha(-)-ZF) that
removed the HBA1 gene (141800) and the HBQ1 gene (142240) and juxtaposed
a region that normally lies approximately 18 kb downstream of the
alpha-globin cluster to a site next to the structurally normal HBA2
gene. The alpha(-)-ZF deletion did not remove any positive cis-acting
sequences, but expression of the structurally intact alpha-globin gene
was stably silenced and, during development, its CpG island became
densely methylated and insensitive to endonucleases over a region of
approximately 2 kb. Tufarelli et al. (2003) showed that the deletion had
truncated the widely expressed gene LUC7L (607782), which is transcribed
from the opposite DNA strand. They showed that in the affected
individual, in a transgenic model, and in differentiating embryonic stem
cells, transcription of antisense RNA mediated silencing and methylation
of the associated CpG island. This was identified as a novel mechanism
underlying human genetic disease.

.0058
HEMOGLOBIN CHARTRES
HBA2, PHE33SER

Prehu et al. (2003) found a new phe33-to-ser (F33S) variant (designated
Hb Chartres) in the HBA2 gene in a 31-year-old female of French origin
presenting with mild microcytic hypochromic anemia. No family studies
could be performed.

.0059
HEMOGLOBIN FUKUI
HBA2, LYS139ASN

Harano et al. (2003) found a lys139-to-asn (K139N) missense mutation,
resulting from an AAA-to-AAC transversion, in a 52-year-old Japanese
male. The change was in the same position 139 of the alpha-2 chain as
hemoglobin Tokoname (K139T; 141800.0149) and Hb Hanamaki (K139E;
141850.0023), 2 variants found in Japanese, both of which show high
oxygen affinity. Harano et al. (2003) found that the nucleotide sequence
of Hb Tokoname was ACA instead of AAA at codon 139 of the alpha-2-globin
gene. In the case of Hb Hanamaki, 9 of 12 Japanese families found
Honshu, the main island of Japan, were investigated, and the nucleotide
sequence GAA instead of AAA was identified at codon 139 of the
alpha-1-globin gene. However, in 1 family found in Kyushu, the western
most main island, the mutation was identified in the alpha-2-globin
gene. Thus, 3 different types of mutation at the same codon of the
alpha-globin gene were discovered in the same population and, moreover,
in the case of Hb Hanamaki, the nucleotide mutation was observed in both
the alpha-1- and the alpha-2-globin genes.

.0060
HEMOGLOBIN PART-DIEU
HBA2, ALA65THR

In a 58-year-old man of French Caucasian origin living in Lyon, France,
Lacan et al. (2004) identified an ala65-to-thr (A65T) mutation in the
HBA2 gene. The patient suffered from type II diabetes (125853) and had
hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, microlithiasis, hypercholesterolemia, and
hypertriglyceridemia.

.0061
HEMOGLOBIN DECINES-CHARPIEU
HBA2, ALA69THR

In a 34-year-old man of French Caucasian origin living in the city of
Decines-Charpieu in the south of France, Lacan et al. (2004) identified
an ala69-to-thr (A69T) mutation in the HBA2 gene.

.0062
HEMOGLOBIN VAL DE MARNE
HEMOGLOBIN FOOTSCRAY
HBA2, SER133ARG

Two different research teams, Wajcman et al. (1993) and Owen and Hendy
(1994), independently reported this hemoglobin variant, a ser133-to-arg
(S133R) substitution. Wajcman et al. (1993) discovered the mutation
(named Hb Val de Marne) in 2 French newborns who were first cousins.
Owen and Hendy (1994) found the hemoglobin variant (named Hb Footscray)
in a 27-year-old male of Polish-Hungarian descent. Position 133 is an
internal residue located near the heme pocket and the C-terminal end of
the alpha subunit. The mutation from serine to arginine at this position
may facilitate the access of oxygen, or water, to the heme iron. When
compared to adult hemoglobin (Hb A), the variant hemoglobin's oxygen
affinity is increased 1.7-fold and the autooxidation rate is slightly
increased.

Ma et al. (2004) demonstrated that the S133R mutation, caused by an
AGC-to-AGA transversion, is due to mutation in the HBA2 gene and not in
the HBA1 gene. They found the variant in a 15-year-old Chinese girl and
her father.

.0063
ALPHA-THALASSEMIA
HBA2, GLU23TER

Siala et al. (2004) described a 3-year-old Tunisian girl who had Hb
Bart's (gamma-4) at birth, later on presenting with moderate anemia,
microcytosis, and hypochromia; she had a normal HBA2 level and no
abnormal hemoglobin fraction. After excluding most of the common
Mediterranean mutations, sequencing of the HBA2 gene identified a
heterozygous change of codon 23 from GAG (glu) to TAG (ter) (glu23 to
ter). The E23X mutation was also found in the mother in heterozygous
state.

.0064
ALPHA-PLUS-THALASSEMIA
HBA2, GLY22GLY

In a 79-year-old woman of Surinamese-Hindustani origin with moderate
microcytic hypochromic anemia, Harteveld et al. (2004) identified a
silent mutation at codon 22 of the HBA2 gene, GGC (gly) to GGT (gly)
(gly22 to gly), resulting in a splice donor site consensus sequence
between codons 22 and 23. The abnormally spliced mRNA led to a premature
termination between codons 48 and 49. The presence of a downstream
intron was thought to induce the intracellular degradation of the
affected mRNA, through the pathway of nonsense-mediated decay (NMD),
thus explaining the alpha(+)-thalassemia phenotype of the patient. The
C-to-T transition was said to be the first reported mutation creating a
splice donor site in 1 of the alpha-globin genes.

.0065
HEMOGLOBIN ZURICH ALBISRIEDEN
ALPHA-PLUS-THALASSEMIA, INCLUDED
HBA2, GLY59ARG

In a patient presenting with persistent hypochromic microcytosis and
erythrocytosis, Dutly et al. (2004) identified a G-to-C transversion in
the HBA2 gene, resulting in a gly59-to-arg (G59R) substitution. The
defect, designated Hb Zurich Albisrieden, was not detected at the
protein level and led to alpha-plus-thalassemia.

.0066
HEMOGLOBIN PASSY
HBA2, SER81PRO

In a 3-month-old Turkish boy investigated for anemia with hypochromia
and microcytosis, Lacan et al. (2005) identified a TCC-to-CCC transition
in codon 81 of the HBA2 gene, resulting in substitution of proline for
serine (S81P).

.0067
HEMOGLOBIN PLASENCIA
HBA2, LEU125ARG

In a Spanish family residing in Plasencia with moderate microcytosis and
hypochromia, Martin et al. (2005) identified heterozygosity for a
CTG-to-CGG transversion at codon 125 of the HBA2 gene, resulting in a
leu125-to-arg substitution.

.0068
HEMOGLOBIN KUROSAKI
HBA2, LYS7GLU

In the course of assaying glycosylated hemoglobin in a diabetic patient,
Harano et al. (1995) found a new alpha-chain variant, which they named
Hb Kurosaki after the city where the patient lived. Structural analysis
demonstrated substitution of glutamic acid for lysine at position 7.
From studies of a 30-year-old Thai male with normal hematologic profile
at the steady state, Ngiwsara et al. (2005) found the same hemoglobin
variant and demonstrated that the mutation was localized to the HBA2
gene and was caused by heterozygosity for an AAG-to-GAG transition in
codon 7.

HEMOGLOBIN H DISEASE, NONDELETIONAL
HBA2, 1-BP DEL, 2T

Viprakasit et al. (2005) stated that in Thailand at least 7,000 new
cases of Hb H disease (613978) are expected each year, because nearly
25% of the population is heterozygous for either deletional or
nondeletional alpha-thalassemia determinants. The clinical phenotypes of
affected individuals with Hb H disease are highly variable, ranging from
stillbirths in Hb Bart's hydrops fetalis to very mild clinical symptoms.
Viprakasit et al. (2005) described a rare initiation codon mutation of
the HBA2 gene, a 1-bp deletion of thymine at the second nucleotide of
the ATG initiation codon, in compound heterozygous state with
alpha-0-thalassemia. Other reported changes in the initiation codon of
HBA2 are met1 to thr (141850.0020) and met1 to val (141850.0022).

This mutation was described for the first time by Waye et al. (1997) in
an 8-year-old Canadian girl of Vietnamese descent. Pallor had been
evident since birth, and hypochromic microcytic anemia was first
documented at age 20 months.

.0070
HEMOGLOBIN AL-HAMMADI RIYADH
HBA2, ASP75VAL

During a routine hemoglobin analysis for anemia in a 16-month-old boy
who lived in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Burnichon et al. (2006) identified
heterozygosity for an A-T transversion in exon 2 of the HBA2 gene,
resulting in an asp75-to-val (D75V) substitution. The child had no
hepatomegaly or splenomegaly. This was the sixth hemoglobin variant
described at position 75 of the alpha-globin chain.

.0071
ALPHA-THALASSEMIA, HMONG TYPE
HBA2, 1-BP DEL, 1A

Eng et al. (2006) studied a newborn male of Hmong descent who had an
elevated level of Hb Bart's (more than 25%) indicative of Hb H disease.
Deletion-specific PCR demonstrated that he was heterozygous for the
Southeast Asian alpha-0-thal deletion. PCR amplification and direct
nucleotide sequence analysis of the intact alpha-globin gene cluster
revealed a 1-bp deletion of adenine from the translation initiation
codon (ATG) of the HBA2 gene.

.0072
HEMOGLOBIN H HYDROPS FETALIS SYNDROME
HBA2, 3-BP DEL, GLU30

In a patient with hemoglobin H hydrops fetalis (see 236750), Chan et al.
(1997) detected a deletion of codon 30 (deltaGAG, glu) in the hemoglobin
alpha-2 gene on one chromosome The other chromosome carried a large
deletion that removed both alpha-globin genes and the zeta-globin
(142310) gene. The mutant protein was apparently highly unstable since
there was no detectable radioactive or protein peak upon in vitro globin
chain synthesis. HbH was 2.5%, Hb Bart's 31%, HbF 28%, and HbA 38.5%. In
a review of the literature, Lorey et al. (2001) noted that this patient
died minutes after birth at 39 weeks' gestation, with ascites,
hepatomegaly, and placentomegaly present.

.0073
HEMOGLOBIN H HYDROPS FETALIS SYNDROME
HBA2, GLY59ASP

In a patient with hemoglobin H hydrops fetalis (see 236750), Chan et al.
(1997) detected a gly59-to-asp (G59D) substitution on one allele of the
HBA2 gene, resulting from a G-to-A transition. Both alpha-globin genes
on the other chromosome were removed by the Southeast Asian deletion
(Lorey et al., 2001). Fetal blood sampling at 28 weeks' gestation
revealed Hb Bart's of 39%, HbF 39%, and HbA 9%. An intrauterine
transfusion was given at 29 weeks, and the patient was delivered by
cesarean section at 34 weeks. The baby survived a turbulent neonatal
period and was discharged at 3 months of age. He required monthly
transfusions and at age 2 years had passed normal developmental
milestones. Chan et al. (1997) noted that this same mutation had been
reported in the HBA1 gene (Hb Adana; 141800.0174) and had been
coinherited with an alpha-thalassemia-1 deletion on the other allele,
resulting in hemoglobin H disease. Chan et al. (1997) suggested that the
more severe phenotype in their patient had resulted from the missense
mutation's occurrence in the HBA2 gene, which transcribes up to twice as
much mRNA as the HBA1 gene.

.0074
HEMOGLOBIN H HYDROPS FETALIS SYNDROME
HBA2, SER35PRO

In a patient of Filipino ancestry with hemoglobin H hydrops fetalis
syndrome (see 236750), Lorey et al. (2001) detected a ser35-to-pro
(S35P) substitution in the paternal allele of the HBA2 gene that had
resulted from a T-to-C transition. The maternal chromosome carried the
Filipino deletion removing the alpha-1 (141800), alpha-2, and
zeta-globin (142310) genes. Clinical manifestations at birth by cesarean
section at 34 weeks included pericardial effusion, fetal distress,
jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, ambiguous genitalia with fourth-degree
hypospadias, and bilateral inguinal testes. He required 6 transfusions
in the first 4 months of life; thereafter, hemoglobin levels stabilized.
At 13 months of age developmental milestones were consistent with an
estimated chronologic age of 10 months.

DESCRIPTION 
GENE FUNCTION

Phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of the largest subunit of RNA
polymerase II (POLR2A; 180660) is believed to control the transition
from transcription initiation to elongation. The general transcription
factor TFIIH contains a kinase activity capable of phosphorylating this
domain (Lu et al., 1992). Factors that promote the association of RNA
polymerase II with the preinitiation complex stimulate this activity.
TFIIE, which is required for the stable association of TFIIH with the
preinitiation complex, affects the processivity of TFIIH kinase. TFIIH
is a multisubunit factor consisting of at least 5 polypeptides of 92
(133510), 62, 43 (601748), 40, and 35 (601750) kD (Flores et al., 1992).
A 52-kD subunit (601760) has also been identified as a component of the
TFIIH 'core,' along with p89, p62, p44, and p34 (Marinoni et al., 1997).
Lu et al. (1992) expressed the belief that TFIIH is the human
counterpart of the yeast general transcription factor b. See also 133530
and Habraken et al. (1996).

Shiekhattar et al. (1995) purified TFIIH and found that it contained
material that reacted with antibodies to cyclin-dependent kinase 7
(CDK7; 601955) and cyclin H (601953). The authors confirmed the presence
of the CDK-activating kinase complex as a distinct component of TFIIH,
suggesting a link, by the phosphorylation of the cell division cycle 2
(116940) or CDK2 (116953) genes, between TFIIH and the processes of
transcription, DNA repair, and cell cycle progression.

Mammalian CDK8 (603184) and cyclin C (123838) are components of the RNA
polymerase II holoenzyme complex, where they function as a protein
kinase that phosphorylates the C-terminal domain of the largest subunit
of RNA polymerase II. The CDK8/cyclin C protein complex is also found in
a number of mammalian 'Mediator'(see 602984)-like protein complexes,
which repress activated transcription independently of the C-terminal
domain in vitro. Akoulitchev et al. (2000) demonstrated that CDK8/cyclin
C can regulate transcription by targeting the CDK7/cyclin H subunits of
TFIIH. CDK8 phosphorylates mammalian cyclin H at serine-5 and serine-304
both in vitro and in vivo, in the vicinity of its functionally unique N-
and C-terminal alpha-helical domains. This phosphorylation represses
both the ability of TFIIH to activate transcription and its C-terminal
kinase activity. In addition, mimicking CDK8 phosphorylation of cyclin H
in vivo has a dominant-negative effect on cell growth. Akoulitchev et
al. (2000) concluded that their results linked the Mediator complex and
the basal transcription machinery by a regulatory pathway involving 2
cyclin-dependent kinases. This pathway appears to be unique to higher
organisms.

High levels of gene transcription by RNA polymerase II depend on high
rates of transcription initiation and reinitiation. Initiation requires
recruitment of the complete transcription machinery to a promoter, a
process facilitated by activators and chromatin remodeling factors.
Reinitiation is thought to occur through a different pathway. After
initiation, a subset of the transcription machinery remains at the
promoter, forming a platform for assembly of a second transcription
complex. Yudkovsky et al. (2000) described the isolation of a
reinitiation intermediate in yeast that includes transcription factors
TFIID, TFIIA (see 600520), TFIIH, TFIIE, and Mediator. This intermediate
can act as a scaffold for formation of a functional reinitiation
complex. Formation of this scaffold is dependent on ATP and TFIIH. In
yeast, the scaffold is stabilized in the presence of the activator
Gal4-VP16, but not Gal4-AH, suggesting a new role for some activators
and Mediator in promoting high levels of transcription.

Hoogstraten et al. (2002) generated cell lines expressing functional
GFP-tagged TFIIH. TFIIH was homogeneously distributed throughout the
nucleus with nucleolar accumulations. The authors provided in vivo
evidence for involvement of TFIIH in RNA polymerase I transcription.
Photobleaching revealed that TFIIH moved freely and was engaged in RNA
polymerase I and II transcription for approximately 25 seconds and
approximately 6 seconds, respectively. TFIIH readily switched between
transcription and repair sites, where it was immobilized for 4 minutes,
without large-scale alterations in composition. These findings supported
a model of diffusion and random collision of individual components that
permits a quick and versatile response to changing conditions.

Trichothiodystrophy (TTD; 601675) is a rare hereditary multisystem
disorder associated with defects in nucleotide excision repair (NER) as
a consequence of mutation in XPD (126340), XPB (133510), or TTDA
(608780), 3 genes that are related to TFIIH. Botta et al. (2002) showed
that all the mutations found in TTD cases, irrespective of whether they
were homozygotes, hemizygotes, or compound heterozygotes, caused a
substantial and specific reduction (by up to 70%) in the cellular
concentration of TFIIH. However, the degree of reduction in TFIIH did
not correlate with the severity of the pathologic phenotype, suggesting
that the severity of the clinical features in TTD cannot be related
solely to the effects of mutations on the stability of TFIIH. Mild
reductions (up to 40%) in TFIIH content were also found in some, but not
all, cell strains from patients with xeroderma pigmentosum (see 278700).
Botta et al. (2002) concluded that the severity of the clinical features
in TTD patients and the clinical outcome of differentially mutated XPD
proteins may depend both on the effects that each mutation has on the
stability of TFIIH as well as on the transcriptional activity of the
residual TFIIH complexes.

GENE FAMILY

Initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II is a complex process
requiring, in addition to the polymerase itself, 7 auxiliary factors.
Entry of the polymerase into the transcription cycle is mediated by
transcription factor TFIIF (see 189968) and requires a DNA-protein
complex composed of the TATA-binding protein subunit of TFIID (313650)
in association with the TATA motif and TFIIB (189963), the so-called DB
complex. The largest subunit of mammalian RNA polymerase II (POLR2A;
180660) contains a heptapeptide repeat, YSPTSPS in the single-letter
amino acid code, occurring 52 times at its C terminus. Because the
heptapeptide contains serine, threonine, and tyrosine, it is prone to
phosphorylation. As a result, RNA polymerase II occurs in 2 forms in
vivo: a highly phosphorylated II(O) form and a nonphosphorylated II(A)
form. The nonphosphorylated form of RNA polymerase II is recruited by
TFIIF to the DB complex. This complex is then recognized by TFIIE
(189962), TFIIH, and TFIIJ, which enter the transcription cycle in that
order, to generate a transcription-competent complex (summary by Lu et
al., 1992).

Giglia-Mari et al. (2004) tabulated the 10 subunits of TFIIH. They
referred to GTF2H1 as TFB1.

MAPPING

Heng et al. (1994) mapped the GTF2H1 gene to 11p15.1-p14 by fluorescence
in situ hybridization.

By PCR analysis on hybrid DNAs and the YACs, Fantes et al. (1995) placed
the GTF2H1 gene in their interval XX between the LDHA/C (150000; 150150)
and the SAA (104750) genes. Furthermore, restriction mapping placed
GTF2H1 within 50 kb of LDHA.

Fantes et al. (1995) described a detailed physical map of 11p, extending
from the distal part of 11p13 through the entirety of 11p14 to proximal
11p15.1. The primary level of mapping was based on chromosome
breakpoints that divided the region into 20 intervals. At higher
resolution, YACs covered approximately 12 Mb of the region. The map
incorporated 18 known genes, including precise localization of the
GTF2H1 gene encoding the 62-kD subunit of TFIIH.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Nakamura et al. (2002) cloned mouse Oppo1 (Odf4), which encodes a
protein localized to the outer dense fibers of the mature sperm tail.
Using a human EST with sequence homology to mouse Odf4, Kitamura et al.
(2003) isolated human ODF4 cDNA from a testis cDNA library and ODF4
genomic clones from whole blood. The deduced 257-amino acid ODF4 protein
shares 39.9% identity with the mouse protein. By RT-PCR analysis,
Kitamura et al. (2003) detected a 768-bp transcript expressed
exclusively in testis and, by Western analysis, a 30-kD ODF4 protein in
testis and sperm. Immunofluorescence staining of ejaculated sperm
localized ODF4 to a restricted region from the neck to the middle and
principal pieces of sperm flagellae.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kitamura et al. (2003) determined that the ODF4 gene contains 3 exons
and differs from the 5-exon structure of the mouse gene; most notably,
ODF4 exon 1 extends over mouse exons 1 and 2, and the ODF4 gene lacks an
exon corresponding to exon 3 of the mouse gene.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Kitamura et al. (2003) identified the ODF4
gene on chromosome 17 and the mouse homolog in a region of syntenic
homology on chromosome 11.

300384	TITLE *300384 EMERIN; EMD
;;STA
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The EMD gene encodes a ubiquitous protein, emerin, that is found along
the nuclear rim of many cell types and is a member of the nuclear
lamina-associated protein family. Mutation in the EMD gene has been
found to cause the Emery-Dreifuss type of muscular dystrophy (EDMD;
310300).

CLONING

Bione et al. (1993) constructed a transcriptional map of the 2-Mb region
of Xq28 to which the Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy locus had been
mapped by linkage studies. Within this region, they identified the STA
gene. Bione et al. (1994) determined that STA (EMD) encodes a 254-amino
acid protein, termed emerin, which lacks a signal peptide, contains a
long N-terminal domain, and is hydrophilic except for a highly
hydrophobic 20-amino acid sequence at the C-terminal region. It has
several putative phosphorylation sites and 1 potential glycosylation
site. Northern blot analysis demonstrated ubiquitous expression of a
major, approximately 1-kb transcript, with highest expression in
skeletal muscle and heart and abundant expression in other tissues,
including colon, testis, ovary, and placenta. Bione et al. (1994)
suggested that emerin belongs to a class of tail-anchored membrane
proteins of the secretory pathway involved in vesicular transport.

Manilal et al. (1996) developed a panel of 12 monoclonal antibodies to a
large fragment of emerin cDNA prepared by PCR and expressed as a
recombinant protein in E. coli. These antibodies detected 4 different
epitopes on emerin. All monoclonal antibodies recognized a 34-kD protein
in all tissues tested. Immunofluorescence and cell fractionation studies
confirmed that emerin is located in the nuclear membrane. Amino acid
sequence similarities and cellular localization suggested that emerin is
a member of the nuclear lamina-associated protein family.

Small et al. (1997) isolated and characterized the complete mouse emerin
gene. The 2.9-kb mouse emerin gene comprises 6 exons and encodes a
protein 73% identical to that of the human protein. As in the human, the
gene encodes a serine-rich protein similar to lamina-associated
protein-2 (LAP2; 188380) and shows critical LAP2 phosphorylation sites.

GENE FUNCTION

Cartegni et al. (1997) reported that emerin localizes to the inner
nuclear membrane via its hydrophobic C-terminal domain, but that in
heart and cultured cardiomyocytes, it is also associated with the
intercalated discs. They proposed a general role for emerin in membrane
anchorage to the cytoskeleton. In the nuclear envelope, emerin plays a
ubiquitous and indispensable role in association of the nuclear membrane
with the lamina. In heart, it is specifically located to desmosomes and
fasciae adherentes. Desmosomes and fasciae adherentes anchor
desmin-containing intermediate filaments and the bundles of sarcomeric
myofilaments, respectively. They consist of transmembrane adhesive
glycoproteins, members of the cadherin superfamily, and of cytoplasmic
proteins such as vinculin (193065), catenins, and actin-binding
proteins. Different assortments of the same or similar proteins in
desmosomes, fasciae adherentes, focal adhesions, and other adhesive
junctions seem to confer specific functions to ensure cell-cell
communication and tight adhesion between cells and to the extracellular
matrix. The role of this complex assortment of proteins is best
demonstrated by the existence of many genetic diseases that perturb
adhesion and in the heart by the dramatic consequences of plakoglobin
(gamma-catenin) knockout (Ruiz et al., 1996): plakoglobin -/- mice die
at midgestation due to rupture of the ventricles. In heart, the specific
localization of emerin to desmosomes and fasciae adherentes could
account for the characteristic conduction defects described in patients
with Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy.

Yorifuji et al. (1997) likewise demonstrated that emerin is localized at
the inner nuclear membrane. Studies for ultrastructural localization of
the protein in human skeletal muscle and HeLa cells, using ultrathin
cryosections, showed that immune-labeled colloidal gold particles were
localized on the nucleoplasmic surface of the inner nuclear membrane,
but not on the nuclear pore. They interpreted their results as
indicating that emerin anchors at the inner nuclear membrane through the
hydrophobic stretch and protrudes from the hydrophilic region to the
nuclear plasm where it interacts with the nuclear lamina. They
speculated that emerin contributes to maintenance of the nuclear
structure and stability, as well as nuclear functions, particularly in
muscle tissues that have severe stress with rigorous
contraction-relaxation movements and calcium flux.

By mutation analysis, Lee et al. (2001) determined that several, but not
all, disease mutations in emerin map to a central lamin A (LMNA;
150330)-binding domain, and that mutations in this region disrupt
emerin-lamin A interaction. They also found that emerin binds directly
to BAF (BANF1; 603811), a DNA-bridging protein, and this binding
required conserved residues in the N-terminal LEM domain of emerin. The
disease-linked emerin proteins all remained active for BAF binding both
in vitro and in vivo.

Haraguchi et al. (2001) visualized colocalization between emerin and BAF
at the 'core' region of chromosomes during telophase in HeLa cells. An
emerin mutant defective in BAF binding in vitro failed to localize at
the core in vivo and subsequently failed to localize at the reformed
nuclear envelope. In HeLa cells expressing a BAF mutant that did not
show core localization, endogenous emerin failed to localize at the core
region during telophase and did not assemble into the nuclear envelope
during the subsequent interphase. This BAF mutant also dominantly
dislocalized LAP2-beta (188380) and lamin A from the nuclear envelope.
Haraguchi et al. (2001) concluded that BAF is required for the assembly
of emerin and A-type lamins at the reforming nuclear envelope during
telophase and may mediate their stability in the subsequent interphase.

Jacque and Stevenson (2006) examined susceptibility of primary
macrophages to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection following
short interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated silencing of nuclear lamins and
several lamin-associated proteins. They found that silencing of emerin
and BAF prevented infection with HIV-1, but not murine leukemia virus,
by preventing integration of the virus into host DNA. Chromatin
immunoprecipitation analysis identified emerin and BAF as cooperative
cofactors of HIV-1, and mutation analysis showed that viral cDNA did not
associate with BAF defective in emerin binding or with emerin lacking
the LEM domain. Jacque and Stevenson (2006) concluded that HIV-1 cDNA,
upon entering the nucleus, must interact with emerin to contact
chromatin, and they suggested that molecules that prevent this
interaction might promote abortive HIV-1 infection of a cell.

Ho et al. (2013) demonstrated that ectopic expression of emerin, which
is mislocalized in Lmna-null and Lmna(N195K/N195K) (see 150330.0007)
mutant cells, restored nuclear translocation of the mechanosensitive
transcription factor megakaryoblastic leukemia-1 (MKL1; 606078) and
rescued actin dynamics. These data indicated that emerin is a crucial
modulator of actin polymerization and that loss of emerin from the
nuclear envelope causes disturbed actin dynamics and impaired MKL1
signaling. Ho et al. (2013) concluded that these and other findings
suggested a novel mechanism that could provide insight into the disease
etiology for the cardiac phenotype in many laminopathies, whereby lamin
A/C and emerin regulate gene expression through modulation of nuclear
and cytoskeletal actin polymerization.

GENE STRUCTURE

Bione et al. (1995) reported the sequence of the EMD gene, which is
2,100 bp long. The gene contains 6 exons.

MAPPING

Bione et al. (1994) identified the EMD gene on a transcriptional map of
Xq28.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 5 patients with X-linked Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD1;
310300), Bione et al. (1994) identified mutations in the EMD gene
(300384.0001-300384.0005). These mutations resulted in the loss of all
or part of the protein.

Ellis et al. (1999) stated that more than 70 different mutations had
been identified in the emerin gene. They described 2 missense mutations
involving proline-183: P183H (300384.0008) and P183T (300384.0009).
Biochemical analyses had demonstrated that the mobility and expression
levels of the mutant forms of emerin are indistinguishable from those of
wildtype emerin, but that they have weakened interactions with nuclear
lamina components.

In a large consanguineous Algerian family segregating isolated atrial
cardiac conduction defects and Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy, Ben
Yaou et al. (2007) identified a deletion of lys37 (delK37) in the EMD
gene. Two men with EDMD were hemizygous for the mutation and homozygous
for an LMNA mutation (150330.0020). Three males who were hemizygous for
delK37 developed isolated atrial cardiac conduction defects in their
forties; 1 asymptomatic male carrier was 32 years old. Three of 5 women
heterozygous for delK37 also had cardiac disease. Ben Yaou et al. (2007)
stated that this was the first report of an EMD mutation giving rise to
isolated cardiac disease.

Brown et al. (2011) identified pathogenic mutations in the EMD gene in
23 (9.0%) of 255 North American patients referred for testing for EDMD.
There were 8 novel and 10 recurrent mutations. Most (90.5%) of the
mutations were predicted to result in a severely truncated or lack of
protein. Analysis of 130 EMD mutations indicated that exon 2 may be a
hotspot, perhaps owing to the high GC content.

ANIMAL MODEL

Frock et al. (2006) found that most cultured muscle cells from Lmna
knockout mice exhibited impaired differentiation kinetics and reduced
differentiation potential. Similarly, knockdown of Lmna or emerin
expression by RNA interference in normal muscle cells impaired
differentiation potential and reduced expression of muscle-specific
genes, Myod (159970) and desmin (125660). To determine whether impaired
myogenesis was linked to reduced Myod or desmin levels, Frock et al.
(2006) individually expressed these proteins in Lmna-null myoblasts and
found that both increased the differentiation potential of mutant
myoblasts. Frock et al. (2006) concluded that LMNA and emerin are
required for myogenic differentiation, at least in part, through an
effect on expression of critical myoblast proteins.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001

In affected members of a family with Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy
(310300), Bione et al. (1994) found insertion of 2 basepairs after
nucleotide 198 of the EMD gene, resulting in a frameshift and a stop

.0005
EMERY-DREIFUSS MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, X-LINKED
EMD, IVSAS, A-G, -3, 214-BP INS

In affected members of a family with Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy
(310300), Bione et al. (1994) found an A-to-G transition at the -3
position in a 3-prime splice junction of the EMD gene. The mutation was
first detected as an abnormality in the sequence of an RT-PCR product
which showed insertion of 214 bp at nucleotide 324. The nucleotide
sequence of the genomic fragments confirmed that the 214-bp insertion
was an unspliced intron. In the presence of the mutation, alternative
3-prime splice junctions were used at position -87 of the same intron
and position 365 in the next exon, giving 2 additional bands of size
intermediate between the normal and the band reflecting the 214-bp
insertion.

Klauck et al. (1995) identified novel mutations in 3 families with
Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (310300). One of these was a C-to-T
transition at nucleotide 188, resulting in a change of codon 43 from CAG
(gln) to a stop codon.

EMD, 1-BP DEL, FS236TER

In a patient with Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (310300), Yamada and
Kobayashi (1996) found that the emerin gene carried a 1-bp deletion of C
at nucleotide 672 or 673. This deletion caused a frameshift leading to
change in the amino acid sequence (amino acids 206-235) and generating
an early stop codon.

EMD, PRO183HIS

In a man with Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (310300), Ellis et al.
(1999) identified a pro183-to-his mutation in the EMD gene, which they
called the STA gene. The patient was first referred to a neurologist at
age 31 because of back pain, weakness in the legs greater than the arms,
and leg numbness. As a child, he had been limited in his participation
in athletics in school. Upper limb weakness was noticed in childhood,
but no lower limb weakness was noted until age 25. He developed a
burning-quality low back pain at age 27 which radiated into the
posterior aspect of both legs. He had developed third-degree heart block
requiring a pacemaker. There were mild contractures of both ankles but
no elbow contractures.

102578	TITLE *102578 ACUTE PROMYELOCYTIC LEUKEMIA, INDUCER OF; PML
;;MYL
PML/RARA FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The PML tumor suppressor protein is essential for the formation of a
dynamic macromolecular nuclear structure called the PML-nuclear body
(PML-NB). PML-NBs have also been referred to as nuclear domains-10,
Kremer bodies, and PML oncogenic domains. Unlike more specialized
subnuclear structures, PML-NBs are involved in diverse cellular
functions, including sequestration and release of proteins, mediation of
posttranslational modifications, and promotion of nuclear events in
response to various cellular stresses. The PML gene is involved in the
t(15;17) translocation of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL; 612376),
which generates the oncogenic fusion protein PML-retinoic acid
receptor-alpha (RARA; 180240). PML-NBs are disrupted in APL and are thus
implicated in APL pathogenesis (Bernardi and Pandolfi, 2007; Salomoni et
al., 2008).

CLONING

In the process of analyzing the RARA gene in the t(15;17)(q22;q11.2-q12)
translocation specifically associated with APL, de The et al. (1990)
identified a novel gene on chromosome 15 involved with the RARA gene in
formation of a fusion product. This gene, which they called MYL for
'myelocytic leukemia,' was transcribed in the same direction as RARA on
the translocated chromosome. De The et al. (1990) identified a 144-bp
region, flanked by canonical splice acceptor and donor sequences, that
had a high probability of being an exon and showed no significant
similarity to any sequence in a protein data bank, thus suggesting that
MYL is a previously undescribed gene. In a later report, de The et al.
(1991) changed the name of the gene from MYL to PML. They reported,
furthermore, that the gene product contains a novel zinc finger motif
common to several DNA-binding proteins.

Goddard et al. (1991) demonstrated that PML is a putative zinc finger
protein and potential transcription factor that is commonly expressed,
with at least 3 major transcription products.

Goddard et al. (1995) cloned the murine Pml gene. The predicted amino
acid sequence of mouse Pml, a ring-finger protein, shows 80% similarity
to that of the human homolog, with greater than 90% similarity in the
proposed functional domains.

MAPPING

The PML gene maps to chromosome 15q22 (de The et al., 1990).

Goddard et al. (1995) mapped the mouse Pml gene to a region of
chromosome 9 with known homology of synteny to the region of 15q where
PML is located.

GENE FUNCTION

While PML does not colocalize with proliferating cell nuclear antigen
(PCNA; 176740) or spliceosomes, Dyck et al. (1994) showed that it is
part of a macromolecular structure, composed of at least 4 nuclear
proteins, that is adhered to the nuclear matrix. This structure shows a
labeling pattern resembling spheres that vary in both size and number
among individual cells of a given cell line. PML-RAR expression appears
to disrupt the integrity of these structures (referred to by Dyck et al.
(1994) as PML oncogenic domains, or PODs) and thus appears to be the
possible cause of their altered morphology. Retinoid treatment leads to
a striking reassembly of the POD, which in turn is linked to
differentiation of the leukemic cells. These results identified a novel
macromolecular nuclear structure and suggested that it may serve as a
target of cellular transformation.

From their analysis of the phosphoamino acids of the PML protein, Chang
et al. (1995) concluded that both tyrosine and serine residues are
phosphorylated. To investigate whether expression of the PML protein is
cell cycle related, HeLa cells synchronized at various phases of the
cell cycle were analyzed by immunofluorescence staining and confocal
microscopy. They found that PML was expressed at a lower level in S, G2,
and M phases and at a significantly higher level in G1 phase. Other
studies showed that PML is a phosphoprotein and is associated with the
nuclear matrix. Chang et al. (1995) noted that PML shares many
properties with tumor suppressors such as RB (614041).

Fusion of PML and TIF1A (603406) to RARA and BRAF (164757),
respectively, results in the production of PML-RAR-alpha and
TIF1-alpha-B-RAF (T18) oncoproteins. Zhong et al. (1999) showed that
PML, TIF1-alpha, and RXR-alpha (180245)/RAR-alpha function together in a
retinoic acid-dependent transcription complex. Zhong et al. (1999) found
that PML acts as a ligand-dependent coactivator of RXR-alpha/RARA-alpha.
PML interacts with TIF1-alpha and CREB-binding protein (CBP; 600140). In
PML -/- cells, the retinoic acid-dependent induction of genes such as
RARB2, and the ability of TIF1-alpha and CBP to act as transcriptional
coactivators on retinoic acid, are impaired. Zhong et al. (1999) showed
that both PML and TIF1-alpha are growth suppressors required for the
growth-inhibitory activity of retinoic acid. T18, similar to
PML-RAR-alpha, disrupts the retinoic acid-dependent activity of this
complex in a dominant-negative manner, resulting in a growth advantage.
PML-RAR-alpha was the first example of an oncoprotein generated by the
fusion of 2 molecules participating in the same pathway, specifically
the fusion of a transcription factor to one of its own cofactors. Since
the PML and RAR-alpha pathways converge at the transcriptional level,
there is no need for a double-dominant-negative product to explain the
pathogenesis of APL.

Pearson et al. (2000) reported that the tumor suppressor PML regulates
the p53 response to oncogenic signals. Pearson et al. (2000) found that
oncogenic RAS (190020) upregulates PML expression, and that
overexpression of PML induces senescence in a p53-dependent manner. p53
is acetylated at lysine-382 upon RAS expression, an event that is
essential for its biologic function. RAS induces relocalization of p53
and the CBP acetyltransferase within the PML nuclear bodies and induces
the formation of a trimeric p53-PML-CBP complex. Lastly, RAS-induced p53
acetylation, p53-CBP complex stabilization, and senescence are lost in
PML -/- fibroblasts. Pearson et al. (2000) concluded that their data
established a link between PML and p53 and indicated that integrity of
the PML bodies is required for p53 acetylation and senescence upon
oncogene expression.

Khan et al. (2001) showed that PML interacts with multiple corepressors
(SKI (164780), NCOR, and Sin3A (607776)) and histone deacetylase-1
(HDAC1; 601241), and that this interaction is required for
transcriptional repression mediated by the tumor suppressor MAD
(600021). PML-RARA has the 2 corepressor-interacting sites and inhibits
MAD-mediated repression, suggesting that aberrant binding of PML-RARA to
the corepressor complexes may lead to abrogation of the corepressor
function. The authors suggested that these mechanisms may contribute to
events leading to leukemogenesis.

Turelli et al. (2001) showed that incoming retroviral preintegration
complexes trigger the exportin (602559)-mediated cytoplasmic export of
the SWI/SNF component INI1 (601607) and of the nuclear body constituent
PML. They further showed that the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
genome associates with these proteins before nuclear migration. In the
presence of arsenic, PML was sequestered in the nucleus, and the
efficiency of HIV-mediated transduction was markedly increased. These
results unveiled an unsuspected cellular response that interferes with
the early steps of HIV replication.

Yang et al. (2002) determined that PML and checkpoint kinase-2 (CHEK2;
604373) mediated p53 (191170)-independent apoptosis following gamma
irradiation of several human cell lines. Endogenous CHEK2 bound PML
within PML nuclear bodies. Following gamma irradiation, CHEK2
phosphorylated PML on ser117, causing dissociation of the 2 proteins.
Apoptosis through this mechanism also required ATM (208900). Yang et al.
(2002) concluded that this pathway to gamma irradiation-induced
apoptosis utilizes ATM, CHEK2, and PML. Overexpression of PML alone
caused apoptosis in U937 myeloid cells.

Lin et al. (2004) demonstrated that cytoplasmic PML is an essential
modulator of TGF-beta signaling. Primary cells from Pml-null mice are
resistant to TGF-beta-dependent growth arrest, induction of cellular
senescence, and apoptosis. These cells also have impaired
phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of the TGF-beta signaling
proteins Smad2 (601366) and Smad3 (603109), as well as impaired
induction of TGF-beta target genes. Expression of cytoplasmic Pml is
induced by TGF-beta. Furthermore, cytoplasmic Pml physically interacts
with Smad2, Smad3, and SMAD anchor for receptor activation (SARA;
603755), and is required for association of Smad2 and Smad3 with Sara
and for the accumulation of Sara and TGF-beta receptor (see 190181) in
the early endosome. The PML-RAR-alpha oncoprotein of acute promyelocytic
leukemia can antagonize cytoplasmic PML function, and acute
promyelocytic leukemia cells have defects in TGF-beta signaling similar
to those observed in Pml-null cells. Lin et al. (2004) concluded that
their findings identified cytoplasmic PML as a critical TGF-beta
receptor and further implicated deregulated TGF-beta signaling in cancer
pathogenesis.

Trotman et al. (2006) demonstrated that the PML tumor suppressor
prevents cancer by inactivating phosphorylated AKT (164730) inside the
nucleus. They found in a mouse model that Pml loss markedly accelerated
tumor onset, incidence, and progression in Pten (601728) heterozygous
mutants, and led to female sterility with features that recapitulate the
phenotype of Foxo3a knockout mice. Trotman et al. (2006) showed that PML
deficiency on its own leads to tumorigenesis in the prostate, a tissue
that is exquisitely sensitive to phosphorylated AKT levels, and
demonstrated that PML specifically recruits the AKT phosphatase PP2a
(see 603113) as well phosphorylated AKT into PML nuclear bodies.
Notably, Trotman et al. (2006) found that PML-null cells are impaired in
PP2a phosphatase activity towards AKT, and thus accumulate nuclear
phosphorylated AKT. As a consequence, the progressive reduction in PML
dose leads to inactivation of FOXO3A-mediated transcription of
proapoptotic BIM (603827) and the cell cycle inhibitor p27(KIP1)
(600778). Trotman et al. (2006) concluded that their results demonstrate
that PML orchestrates a nuclear tumor suppressor network for
inactivation of nuclear phosphorylated AKT, and thus highlight the
importance of AKT compartmentalization in human cancer pathogenesis and
treatment.

Bernardi et al. (2006) identified PML as a critical inhibitor of
neoangiogenesis (the formation of new blood vessels) in vivo, in both
ischemic and neoplastic conditions, through the control of protein
translation. Bernardi et al. (2006) demonstrated that in hypoxic
conditions PML acts as a negative regulator of the synthesis rate of
hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF1A; 603348) by repressing MTOR
(601231). PML physically interacts with MTOR and negatively regulates
its association with the small GTPase RHEB (601293) by favoring MTOR
nuclear accumulation. Notably, PML-null cells and tumors display higher
sensitivity both in vitro and in vivo to growth inhibition by rapamycin,
and lack of PML inversely correlates with phosphorylation of ribosomal
protein S6 (180460) and tumor angiogenesis in mouse and human tumors.
Thus, Bernardi et al. (2006) concluded that their findings identified
PML as a novel suppressor of mTOR and neoangiogenesis.

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis of a human fetal brain cDNA library, followed
by coimmunoprecipitation analysis, Kunapuli et al. (2006) found that
ZNF198 (ZMYM2; 602221) was covalently modified by SUMO1 (601912).
Confocal microscopy showed that a proportion of ZNF198 colocalized with
SUMO1 and PML in PML nuclear bodies, and coimmunoprecipitation analysis
revealed that all 3 proteins resided in a protein complex. Mutation of
the SUMO1-binding site of ZNF198 resulted in degradation of ZNF198,
nuclear dispersal of PML, and loss of punctate PML nuclear bodies.
Kunapuli et al. (2006) found that the MDA-MB-157 breast cancer cell
line, which has a deletion in chromosome 13q11 encompassing the ZNF198
gene, lacked PML nuclear bodies, although PML protein levels appeared
normal. The fusion protein ZNF198/FGFR1 (136350), which occurs in
atypical myeloproliferative disease (613523) and lacks the SUMO1-binding
site of ZNF198, could dimerize with wildtype ZNF198 and disrupt its
function. Expression of ZNF198/FGFR1 disrupted PML sumoylation and
nuclear body formation and resulted in cytoplasmic localization of
SUMO1. Kunapuli et al. (2006) concluded that sumoylation of ZNF198 is
required for PML nuclear body formation.

Ito et al. (2008) showed that PML is critical in the maintenance of
quiescent leukemia-initiating cells and normal hematopoietic stem cells.
They suggested that targeting PML may be an effective treatment for
prevention of relapse in CML (608232).

Song et al. (2008) found that PTEN was aberrantly localized in APL in
which PML function was disrupted by the PML-RARA fusion oncoprotein.
Treatment with drugs that triggered PML-RARA degradation restored
nuclear PTEN. PML opposed the activity of HAUSP (USP7; 602519) towards
PTEN through a mechanism involving DAXX (603186). Confocal microscopy
and immunohistochemistry demonstrated that HAUSP was overexpressed in
prostate cancer and that levels of HAUSP directly correlated with tumor
aggressiveness and with PTEN nuclear exclusion. Song et al. (2008)
concluded that a PML-HAUSP network controls PTEN deubiquitinylation and
subcellular localization, which is perturbed in human cancers.

Arsenic, an ancient drug used in traditional Chinese medicine, has
attracted worldwide interest because it shows substantial anticancer
activity in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Arsenic
trioxide exerts its therapeutic effect by promoting degradation of
PML-RARA. PML and PML-RARA degradation is triggered by their
sumoylation, but the mechanism by which arsenic trioxide induces this
posttranslational modification was unclear. Zhang et al. (2010) showed
that arsenic binds directly to cysteine residues in zinc fingers located
within the RBCC domain of PML-RARA and PML. Arsenic binding induces PML
oligomerization, which increases its interaction with the small
ubiquitin-like protein modifier (SUMO)-conjugating enzyme UBC9 (601661),
resulting in enhanced sumoylation and degradation. Zhang et al. (2010)
concluded that the identification of PML as a direct target of arsenic
trioxide provides insights into the drug's mechanism of action and its
specificity for APL.

In mouse embryonic fibroblasts, Giorgi et al. (2010) found that
extranuclear Pml was specifically enriched at the endoplasmic reticulum
(ER) and at the mitochondria-associated membranes, signaling domains
involved in ER-to-mitochondria calcium ion transport and in induction of
apoptosis. They found Pml in complexes of large molecular size with the
inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor (IP3R; 147265), protein kinase Akt
(164730), and protein phosphatase 2a (176915). Pml was essential for
Akt- and PP2a-dependent modulation of Ip3r phosphorylation and in turn
for Ip3r-mediated calcium ion release from the endoplasmic reticulum.
Giorgi et al. (2010) concluded that their findings provided a
mechanistic explanation for the pleiotropic role of Pml in apoptosis.

functions of PML-NBs.

- PML/RARA Fusion Protein

For information on the generation of PML/RARA fusion genes through
translocations associated with APL, see CYTOGENETICS.

Grignani et al. (1993) expressed the PML-RARA protein in U937 myeloid
precursor cells and showed that they lost the capacity to differentiate
under the action of stimuli such as vitamin D3 and transforming growth
factor beta-1 (TGFB1; 190180), acquired enhanced sensitivity to retinoic
acid, and exhibited a higher growth rate consequent to diminished
apoptotic cell death. These results provided evidence of biologic
activity of the fusion protein and recapitulated critical features of
the promyelocytic leukemia phenotype.

Lin et al. (1998) reported that the association of PLZF-RAR-alpha (see
176797) and PML-RAR-alpha with the histone deacetylase complex (see
605164) helps to determine both the development of APL and the ability
of patients to respond to retinoids. Consistent with these observations,
inhibitors of histone deacetylase dramatically potentiate
retinoid-induced differentiation of retinoic acid-sensitive, and restore
retinoid responses of retinoic acid-resistant, APL cell lines. Lin et
al. (1998) concluded that oncogenic retinoic acid receptors mediate
leukemogenesis through aberrant chromatin acetylation, and that
pharmacologic manipulation of nuclear receptor cofactors may be a useful
approach in the treatment of human disease.

Grignani et al. (1998) demonstrated that both PML-RAR-alpha and
PLZF-RAR-alpha fusion proteins recruit the nuclear corepressor (NCOR;
see 600849)-histone deacetylase complex through the RAR-alpha CoR box.
PLZF-RAR-alpha contains a second, retinoic acid-resistant binding site
in the PLZF amino-terminal region. High doses of retinoic acid release
histone deacetylase activity from PML-RAR-alpha, but not from
PLZF-RAR-alpha. Mutation of the NCOR binding site abolishes the ability
of PML-RAR-alpha to block differentiation, whereas inhibition of histone
deacetylase activity switches the transcriptional and biologic effects
of PLZF-RAR-alpha from being an inhibitor to an activator of the
retinoic acid signaling pathway. Therefore, Grignani et al. (1998)
concluded that recruitment of histone deacetylase is crucial to the
transforming potential of APL fusion proteins, and the different effects
of retinoic acid on the stability of the PML-RAR-alpha and
PLZF-RAR-alpha corepressor complexes determines the differential
response of APLs to retinoic acid.

RAR and acute myeloid leukemia-1 (AML1; 151385) transcription factors
are found in leukemias as fusion proteins with PML and ETO (CBFA2T1;
133435), respectively. Association of PML-RAR and AML1-ETO with the
NCOR-histone deacetylase complex is required to block hematopoietic
differentiation. Minucci et al. (2000) showed that PML-RAR and AML1-ETO
exist in vivo within high molecular weight nuclear complexes, reflecting
their oligomeric state. Oligomerization requires PML or ETO coiled-coil
regions and is responsible for abnormal recruitment of NCOR,
transcriptional repression, and impaired differentiation of primary
hematopoietic precursors. Fusion of RAR to a heterologous
oligomerization domain recapitulated the properties of PML-RAR,
indicating that oligomerization per se is sufficient to achieve
transforming potential. These results showed that oligomerization of a
transcription factor, imposing an altered interaction with
transcriptional coregulators, represents a novel mechanism of oncogenic
activation.

The recruitment of the nuclear receptor corepressor SMRT (NCOR2; 600848)
and subsequent repression of retinoid target genes is critical for the
oncogenic function of PML-RARA. Lin and Evans (2000) showed that the
ability of PML-RARA to form homodimers is both necessary and sufficient
for its increased binding efficiency to corepressor and its inhibitory
effects on hormonal responses in myeloid differentiation. Furthermore,
the authors found that altered stoichiometric interaction of SMRT with
PML-RARA homodimers may underlie these processes. An RXR mutant lacking
transactivation function AF2 recapitulated many biochemical and
functional properties of PML-RARA. Taken together, these results
indicated that altered dimerization of a transcription factor can be
directly linked to cellular transformation, and they implicated
dimerization interfaces of oncogenes as potential drug targets.

Pandolfi (2001) reviewed the roles of the RARA and PML genes in the
pathogenesis of APL and discussed the multiple oncogenic activities of
PML-RARA.

Di Croce et al. (2002) demonstrated that PML-RARA fusion protein induces
gene hypermethylation and silencing by recruiting DNA methyltransferases
to target promoters and that hypermethylation contributes to its
leukemogenic potential. Retinoic acid treatment induces promoter
demethylation, gene reexpression, and reversion of the transformed
phenotype. Di Croce et al. (2002) concluded that their results establish
a mechanistic link between genetic and epigenetic changes during
transformation and suggest that hypermethylation contributes to the
early steps of carcinogenesis.

The fusion protein PML-RARA initiates APL when expressed in the early
myeloid compartment of transgenic mice. Lane and Ley (2003) found that
PML-RARA was cleaved in several positions by a neutral serine protease
in a human myeloid cell line; purification revealed that the protease
was neutrophil elastase (ELA2; 130130). Immunofluorescence localization
studies suggested that cleavage of PML-RARA must have occurred within
the cell, perhaps within the nucleus. The functional importance of ELA2
for APL development was assessed in Ela2-deficient mice. More than 90%
of bone marrow PML-RARA-cleaving activity was lost in the absence of
Ela2, and Ela2-deficient animals, but not cathepsin G (116830)-deficient
animals, were protected from APL development. The authors determined
that primary mouse and human APL cells also contained ELA2-dependent
PML-RARA-cleaving activity. Lane and Ley (2003) concluded that, since
ELA2 is maximally produced in promyelocytes, it may play a role in APL
pathogenesis by facilitating the leukemogenic potential of PML-RARA.

Villa et al. (2006) found that MBD1 (156535) cooperated with PML-RARA in
transcriptional repression and cellular transformation in human cell
lines. PML-RARA recruited MBD1 to its target promoter through an HDAC3
(605166)-mediated mechanism. Binding of HDAC3 and MBD1 was not confined
to the target promoter, but was instead spread over the locus. Knockdown
of HDAC3 expression by RNA interference in acute promyelocytic leukemia
cells alleviated PML-RARA-induced promoter silencing. Furthermore,
retroviral expression of dominant-negative mutants of MBD1 in human
hematopoietic precursors interfered with PML-RARA-induced repression and
restored cell differentiation. Villa et al. (2006) concluded that
PML-RARA recruits an HDAC3-MBD1 complex to target promoters to establish
and maintain chromatin silencing.

CYTOGENETICS

- PML/RARA Fusion Gene

In the process of analyzing the RARA gene in the t(15;17)(q22;q11.2-q12)
translocation specifically associated with acute promyelocytic leukemia
(APL), de The et al. (1990) identified a novel gene on chromosome 15
involved with the RARA gene in formation of a fusion product. This gene,
which they called MYL, was transcribed in the same direction as RARA on
the translocated chromosome. In the chimeric gene, the promoter and
first exon of the RARA gene were replaced by part of the MYL gene. De
The et al. (1990) established that the translocation chromosome
generates an MYL-RARA chimeric transcript. The findings strongly
implicated RARA in leukemogenesis. The possibility was raised that the
altered retinoic acid receptor behaves as a dominant-negative mutant
that blocks the expression of retinoic acid target genes involved in
granulocytic differentiation. In a later report, de The et al. (1991)
changed the name of the gene from MYL to PML. The PML-RARA mRNA encoded
a predicted 106-kD chimeric protein containing most of the PML sequences
fused to a large part of the RARA gene, including its DNA- and
hormone-binding domains.

Goddard et al. (1991) determined that the PML breakpoints were clustered
in 2 regions on either side of an alternatively spliced exon. Although
leukemic cells with translocations characteristically expressed only 1
fusion product, both PML-RARA (on the 15q+ derivative chromosome) and
RARA-PML (on the 17q- derivative) were transcribed. The contribution of
PML to the oncogenicity of the fusion products was demonstrated by the
following: no mutations affecting RARA alone were observed in 20 APLs
analyzed; 2 APLs cytogenetically lacking t(15;17) chromosomes were found
to have rearrangements of both PML and RARA; and PML but not RARA was
molecularly rearranged in a variant APL translocation in which
chromosome 15 had been translocated to another chromosome with no
visible involvement of chromosome 17.

Tong et al. (1992) found that in 20 of 22 patients with a detectable MYL
rearrangement the breakpoints were clustered within a 4.4-kb segment,
which they designated MYL(bcr). The 2 remaining patients exhibited a
more 5-prime rearrangement at about 10-kb upstream of the MYL(bcr)
region, indicating the lack of at least one MYL gene exon in the
resulting MYL-RARA fusion gene.

Cleary (1991) pointed out that detection of the PML-RARA fusion links a
specific molecular defect in neoplasia with a characteristic biologic
and clinical response to pharmacologic therapy. It is a useful marker
for the diagnosis of APL and for the identification of patients who may
benefit from retinoid treatment.

PML, the gene involved in the breakpoint on chromosome 15, is a putative
transcription factor: it contains a cysteine-rich motif that resembles a
zinc finger DNA-binding domain common to several classes of
transcriptional factors. Two fusion genes, PML-RARA and RARA-PML, are
formed as a result of the characteristic translocation in APL.
Heterogeneity of the chromosome 15 breakpoints accounts for the diverse
architecture of the PML-RARA mRNAs isolated from different APL patients,
and alternative splicing of PML exons gives rise to multiple isoforms of
the PML-RARA mRNAs even within a single patient. Alcalay et al. (1992)
investigated the organization and expression pattern of the RARA/PML
gene in a series of APL patients. A RARA-PML transcript was present in
most but not all APL patients. Among 70 patients with APL, Diverio et
al. (1992) found an abnormality in intron 2 of the RARA gene in all
cases, with clustering of rearrangements within the 20-kb intronic
region separating exons 2 and 3. A curious difference was found in the
location of breakpoints in males and females: breakpoints at the 5-prime
end of intron 2 of the RARA gene occurred in females and 3-prime
breakpoints predominated in males.

Stock et al. (2000) pointed out that breakpoints in chromosomes 15 and
17 leading to the translocation associated with APL had been described
as located between 15q22 and 15q26, and between 17q11 and 17q25. Most
studies using FISH had indicated the chromosome 15 breakpoint to be in
15q22. Stock et al. (2000) used a combination of G-banding, FISH, and
chromosome microdissection/reverse in situ hybridization to map the
breakpoints precisely to 15q24 and 17q21.1.

Zaccaria et al. (2002) studied a rare example of cryptic translocation
causing APL. Conventional cytogenetics showed a normal karyotype; PCR
showed a typical PML-RARA rearrangement in exon 1. FISH analysis
revealed that a submicroscopic part of chromosome 15 had been inserted
into 17q. Zaccaria et al. (2002) reviewed other cases of cryptic
translocation; their report appeared to be the first in which both pairs
of chromosomes 15 and 17 were cytogenetically normal and a PML-RARA
fusion gene, discovered after FISH analysis, was located on chromosome
17. A poor response to ATRA therapy was postulated to have a
relationship to the atypical translocation.

Abreu e Lima et al. (2005) described a 47-year-old woman with acute
myeloid leukemia who had simultaneous expression of the PML/RARA and the
AML1/ETO (133435) fusion genes. Despite prolonged use of therapeutic
doses of ATRA plus chemotherapy, the patient did not achieve remission,
in contrast to the experience of most patients with such fusion genes.
Conventional cytogenetics in this case showed the presence of only the
t(8;21) translocation. In previous reports of coexpression of these 2
fusion genes there was evidence of the presence of 2 or 3 distinct
leukemic clones harboring either or both chromosomal translocations.

ANIMAL MODEL

Brown et al. (1997) established a transgenic mouse model that documented
the ability of the chimeric PML-RARA gene to initiate leukemogenesis.
The mice developed 2 currently unrelated abnormalities. The first was a
severe papillomatosis of the skin; the second was a disturbance of
hematopoiesis that presented as a partial block of differentiation in
the neutrophil lineage of the transgenic mice and then progressed at low
frequency to overt APL. The leukemia appeared to be a faithful
reproduction of the human disease, including a therapeutic response to
retinoic acid that reflected differentiation of the leukemic cells. Both
the preleukemic state and the overt leukemia could be transplanted into
nontransgenic hosts. Brown et al. (1997) commented that the model should
be useful for exploring the pathogenesis and treatment of APL.

From studies in mice with disruption of the Pml gene, Wang et al. (1998)
demonstrated that normally, PML regulates hemopoietic differentiation
and controls cell growth and tumorigenesis. PML function is essential
for the tumor-growth-suppressive activity of retinoic acid (RA) and for
its ability to induce terminal myeloid differentiation of precursor
cells. PML was needed for the RA-dependent transactivation of the
p21(Waf1/Cip1) gene (116899), which regulates cell cycle progression and
cellular differentiation. These results provided a framework for
understanding the molecular pathogenesis of APL. Whereas APL might
result from the functional interference of PML/RARA with 2 independent
pathways, PML and RXR/RAR, Wang et al. (1998) showed that these proteins
act, at least in part, in the same pathway. Thus, by simultaneously
interacting with RXR and PML, the fusion gene product may inactivate
this pathway at multiple levels, leading to the proliferative advantage
and the block of hemopoietic differentiation that characterize APL.

David et al. (1997) generated an inducible line of transgenic mice in
which the expression of PML-RARA is driven by the metallothionein
promoter. After 5 days zinc stimulation, 27 of 54 mice developed hepatic
preneoplasia and neoplasia including foci of basophilic hepatocytes,
dysplasia, and carcinoma, with a significantly higher incidence of
lesions in females than in males. The rapid onset of liver pathologies
was dependent on overexpression of the transgene, since it was not
detected in noninduced transgenic animals of the same age. The PML-RARA
protein was always present in altered tissues at much higher levels than
in the surrounding normal liver tissues. In addition, overexpression of
PML-RARA resulted in a strong proliferative response in the hepatocytes.
David et al. (1997) concluded that overexpression of PML-RARA
deregulates subproliferation and can induce tumorigenic changes in vivo.

In an animal model of acute promyelocytic leukemia, Padua et al. (2003)
developed a DNA-based vaccine by fusing the human PML-RARA oncogene to
tetanus fragment C (FrC) sequences. Padua et al. (2003) showed for the
first time that a DNA vaccine specifically targeted to an oncoprotein
can have a pronounced effect on survival, both alone and in combination
with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). The survival advantage was
concomitant with time-dependent antibody production and an increase in
interferon-gamma (IFNG; 147570). Padua et al. (2003) also showed that
ATRA therapy on its own triggered an immune response in this model. When
DNA vaccination and conventional ATRA therapy were combined, they
induced protective immune responses against leukemia progression in
mice. Padua et al. (2003) concluded that this may provide a new approach
to improve clinical outcome in human leukemia.

604982	TITLE *604982 HPS1 GENE; HPS1
;;PALE EAR, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Oh et al. (1996) identified the HPS1 gene by positional cloning. The
HPS1 gene encodes a novel transmembrane protein that is thought to be a
component of multiple cytoplasmic organelles and is apparently crucial
for their normal development and function.

Wildenberg et al. (1998) demonstrated an apparent alternative transcript
of the HPS1 gene. By RT-PCR and Northern blot analysis, 2 polyadenylated
transcripts were found in normal human melanocytes, human bone marrow
cells, human melanoma cells, lymphoblastoid cell lines, and
megakaryocytic leukemia cells. Thus, the HPS1 gene is complex and may
have more than 1 biologically active transcript. Wildenberg et al.
(1998) noted that the same type of alternative splicing occurs in the
IGHM gene (147020), resulting in membrane-bound and secreted protein
products.

GENE FUNCTION

Martina et al. (2003) determined that HPS1 and HPS4 (606682) form a
lysosomal complex that they termed BLOC3 (biogenesis of lysosome-related
organelles complex-3). Coimmunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated
that epitope-tagged and endogenous HPS1 and HPS4 proteins assembled with
each other in vivo. The complex was predominantly cytosolic, with a
small amount peripherally associated with membranes. Size exclusion
chromatography and sedimentation velocity analysis of the cytosolic
fraction indicated that HPS1 and HPS4 formed a moderately asymmetric
complex with a molecular mass of about 175 kD. Hps4-deficient
fibroblasts from light ear mice displayed normal distribution and
trafficking of a lysosomal protein and an apparently normal accumulation
of Zn(2+) in intracellular vesicles. In contrast, fibroblasts of AP3
(see AP3B1; 603401)-deficient pearl mice showed deficits in both of
these measures. Martina et al. (2003) concluded that HPS1 and HPS4 are
components of a cytosolic complex that is involved in the biogenesis of
lysosomal-related organelles through a mechanism distinct from that
operated by the AP3 complex.

MAPPING

Fukai et al. (1995) used the linkage disequilibrium mapping approach to
localize the HPS1 locus in 2 groups in whom the Hermansky-Pudlak
syndrome (203300) is particularly frequent: a group in Puerto Rico and a
group in an isolated village in the Swiss Alps. They localized the HPS1
locus in both groups to a 0.6-cM interval in chromosome segment
10q23.1-q23.2. Wildenberg et al. (1995) likewise mapped the HPS1 locus
to 10q. They collected blood samples from a relatively homogeneous
population in Puerto Rico, where Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome has a
frequency of about 1 in 1,800, giving a carrier frequency estimated to
be 1 in 21. Analysis of pooled DNA samples allowed them to screen the
genome rapidly for candidate loci and identify linkage with a marker on
10q. The result was verified with additional markers, and a maximum lod
score of 5.07 at theta = 0.001 was calculated for marker D10S198.
Haplotype analysis placed the HPS1 locus in a region of approximately 1
cM that contains the markers D10S198 and D10S1239.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Oh et al. (1996) identified homozygous frameshifts in the HPS1 gene in
Puerto Rican, Swiss, Irish, and Japanese HPS patients.

Oh et al. (1998) performed mutation analysis on 44 unrelated Puerto
Rican and 24 unrelated non-Puerto Rican HPS patients. A 16-bp frameshift
duplication (604982.0001), the result of an apparent founder effect, was
nearly ubiquitous among Puerto Rican patients. A frameshift at codon 322
may be the most frequent HPS mutation in Europeans. The mutation in
these cases was a 1-bp insertion (or duplication) in a poly(C) tract at
codons 322 to 324. Oh et al. (1998) also described 6 novel HPS1
mutations: a 5-prime splice-junction mutation of IVS5, 3 frameshifts, a
nonsense mutation, and a 1-codon in-frame deletion. These mutations
defined an apparent frameshift hotspot at codons 321-322. Overall,
however, they detected mutations in the HPS1 gene in only about half of
non-Puerto Rican patients, and presented evidence suggesting locus
heterogeneity for HPS.

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

The different clinical HPS phenotypes associated with different HPS1
frameshifts suggested to Oh et al. (1996) that differentially truncated
HPS1 polypeptides may have somewhat different consequences for
subcellular function.

ANIMAL MODEL

Two genetically distinct mouse loci, 'pale ear' (ep) and 'ruby-eye'
(ru), both with mutant phenotypes similar to human Hermansky-Pudlak
syndrome, map close together in the homologous region of murine
chromosome 19, which suggested that one of these loci might be
homologous to human HPS. Feng et al. (1997) characterized the mouse Hps
cDNA and genomic locus, and identified pathologic Hps gene mutations in
ep but not in ru mice, establishing mouse 'pale ear' as an animal model
for human Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome. The phenotype of homozygous ep
mutant mice encompasses those of both Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome and
Chediak-Higashi syndrome, suggesting that these disorders may be closely
related. In addition, the mouse and human HPS genes both contain a rare
'AT-AC' intron (i.e., an intron with nonconsensus splice sites), and
comparison of the sequences of this intron in the mouse and human genes
identified conserved sequences that suggest a possible role for pre-mRNA
secondary structure in excision of this rare class of introns. (See
601428 and 601429 for a discussion of small nuclear RNAs necessary for
AT-AC intron splicing, and see Hall and Padgett (1994) for a discussion
of introns with nonconsensus splice sites.)

To test for in vivo interactions between the HPS1 and HPS2 genes in the
production and function of intracellular organelles, Feng et al. (2002)
created mice doubly heterozygous for the 2 mutant genes by appropriate
breeding. Cooperation between the 2 genes in melanosome production was
evident in increased hypopigmentation of the coat together with dramatic
quantitative and qualitative alterations of melanosomes of the retinal
pigment epithelium and choroid of double-mutant mice. Lysosomal and
platelet dense granule abnormalities, including hyposecretion of
lysosomal enzymes from kidneys and depression of serotonin
concentrations of platelet dense granules were likewise more severe in
double than in single mutants. Also, lysosomal enzyme concentrations
were significantly increased in lungs of double-mutant mice. Interaction
between the 2 genes was specific in that effects on organelles were
confined to melanosomes, lysosomes, and platelet dense granules.
Together, the evidence indicated that these 2 HPS genes function largely
independently at the whole-organism level to affect the production and
function of all 3 organelles. Furthermore, the increased lysosomal
enzyme levels in lung of double-mutant mice suggested a cause of a major
clinical problem of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome, lung fibrosis.

HERMANSKY-PUDLAK SYNDROME 1
HPS1, 16-BP DUP

By SSCP/heteroduplex analysis and DNA sequencing, Oh et al. (1996) found
that 22 Puerto Rican patients with Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (203300)
were homozygous for a 16-bp duplication within exon 15 of the HPS gene,
resulting in a frameshift distal to codon pro496, with termination of
the nonsense polypeptide at codon 586. Similarly, all 11 obligate
heterozygotes tested were heterozygous, whereas they did not observe
this mutation in 5 Puerto Rican or 15 Asian controls, or in 11
non-Puerto Rican Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome patients. Although
Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome is frequent on the island of Puerto Rico, it
has not been reported elsewhere in the Caribbean. Apparent homogeneity
of the 16-bp frameshift duplication among Puerto Rican Hermansky-Pudlak
syndrome patients suggests that this mutation arose in Puerto Rico
during its early population or colonization and that the frequency of
the mutation was amplified as a founder effect due to occult inbreeding
and genetic drift. The mutation was easily identified, even by simple
agarose electrophoresis of the exon 15 PCR product, which appears
abnormally large; furthermore, heterozygotes additionally exhibit a
prominent aberrant heteroduplex band. Thus, diagnosis, prenatal
diagnosis, and carrier testing for Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome in the
Puerto Rican population, in which the expected frequency of heterozygote
may be as high as 1 in 21 persons, is possible.

All identified patients with Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome in northwest
Puerto Rico were found to be homozygous for the 16-bp duplication in
exon 15 of the HPS gene. Gahl et al. (1998) compared the clinical and
laboratory characteristics of these patients with those of patients
without the 16-bp duplication. They studied 49 patients: 27 Puerto
Ricans and 22 patients from mainland United States who were not of
Puerto Rican descent. The diagnosis was based on the presence of
albinism and the absence of platelet dense bodies. Homozygosity for the
16-bp duplication was found in 25 of the 27 Puerto Rican patients,
whereas none of the non-Puerto Rican patients carried this mutation.
Like the patients without the duplication, the patients with the 16-bp
duplication had a broad variation in pigmentation. Nine of 16 adults
with the duplication, but none of the 10 without it, had a diffusing
capacity for carbon monoxide that was less than 80% of the predicted
value. High-resolution computed tomography in all 12 patients with the
16-bp duplication revealed minimal fibrosis in 8, moderate fibrosis in
1, severe fibrosis in 1, and no fibrosis in 2. Computed tomography in 8
patients without the duplication revealed minimal fibrosis in 3 and no
fibrosis in the rest. Inflammatory bowel disease developed in 8 patients
(4 in each group) between 3 and 25 years of age. Thus, the 16-bp
duplication in exon 15 of the HPS gene, which had been found only in
Puerto Rican patients, is associated with a broad range of pigmentation
and an increased risk of restrictive lung disease in adults.

HERMANSKY-PUDLAK SYNDROME 1
HPS1, 1-BP INS, 322C

In the inbred Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (203300) kindred studied by
Schallreuter et al. (1993), Oh et al. (1996) identified homozygosity for
a frameshift at codon pro324, due to an additional cytosine in a run of
8 cytosines, in the HPS gene. This same mutation (T322insC) was found in
an unrelated Irish-German patient (Oh et al., 1998). The 2 patients were
divergent for intragenic polymorphisms that flank this mutation; the
findings suggested that this frameshift arose independently in the 2
populations. A third patient was homozygous for the frameshift mutation
and for the polymorphic haplotype found in the patient of Irish-German
origin. Patient 4 was a compound heterozygote for the Swiss type
mutation but associated, however, with the Irish-German haplotype; the
other allele in this patient had a novel nonsense mutation, glu666 to
ter (604982.0003).

.0003
HERMANSKY-PUDLAK SYNDROME 1
HPS1, GLU666TER

In a non-Puerto Rican case of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (203300), Oh et
al. (1998) found compound heterozygosity for the T322insC frameshift
mutation (604982.0002) and a novel nonsense mutation, glu666 to ter
(E666X).

.0004
HERMANSKY-PUDLAK SYNDROME 1
HPS1, 1-BP DEL, 322C

Oh et al. (1998) described a Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (203300) patient
who was homozygous for a novel frameshift mutation in the HPS gene,
T322delC, that involved the same poly(C) tract involved in the T322insC
frameshift (604982.0002).

.0005
HERMANSKY-PUDLAK SYNDROME 1
HPS1, GLU133TER

Shotelersuk et al. (1998) studied 18 non-Puerto Rican Hermansky-Pudlak
syndrome (203300) families and identified HPS mutations in 3 of them. In
1 patient, one of the newly identified mutations, E133X, was present in
compound state with a previously described mutation, T322insC
(604982.0002). The patient was a 6-year-old girl of Italian, German, and
Ukrainian ancestry. Born with pale skin, she was noted to have nystagmus
at 2 months of age and pale retinas at 3 months of age, when
oculocutaneous albinism was diagnosed. Bruising began at 7 to 8 months
of age, and Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome was diagnosed at 18 months of age
based on abnormal platelet aggregation studies. Epistaxis occurred in
the winter months and prolonged bleeding accompanied a cut lip and
placement of myringotomy tubes. Asthma was diagnosed at 1 year of age.
There were no signs of colitis or pulmonary fibrosis.

.0006
HERMANSKY-PUDLAK SYNDROME 1
HPS1, 1-BP INS, 962G

Horikawa et al. (2000) reported a Japanese man with Hermansky-Pudlak
syndrome (203300), who had oculocutaneous albinism and a bleeding
diathesis. The patient was a compound heterozygote for 2 HPS1 mutations:
a frameshift mutation (962-963insG) at codon 321 in exon 11; and a
5-prime splice-junction mutation (IVS5+5G-A). The content of eumelanin
in the patient's hairs was significantly reduced. Histologic analysis
using light and electron microscopy revealed that melanocytes in the
patient's epidermis contained giant melanosomes.

603071	TITLE *603071 G PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTOR 17; GPR17
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Members of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily contain 7
transmembrane domains and transduce extracellular signals through
heterotrimeric G proteins. By PCR using degenerate oligonucleotides
based on regions conserved between IL8RA (146929) and the angiotensin II
chemokine GPCR (106165), Raport et al. (1996) isolated the GPR17 gene,
which they called R12. Independently, Blasius et al. (1998) used RT-PCR
to identify novel P2 nucleotide (P2Y) GPCRs (see 601167) and isolated
GPR17 cDNAs. They identified 2 GPR17 splice variants, designated HIP4
and FB1, which encode predicted proteins of 339 and 367 amino acids,
respectively. Northern blot analysis revealed that human GPR17 is
expressed as 2.3- and 6.3-kb mRNAs exclusively in brain. The 2
transcripts appear to represent alternatively polyadenylated variants.
Based on protein sequence homology and the conservation of certain key
residues, GPR17 appears to be closely related to the P2Y family of
GPCRs. However, Blasius et al. (1998) stated that preliminary functional
data did not support the hypothesis that classical P2Y agonists serve as
ligands for this receptor.

GENE FUNCTION

Ciana et al. (2006) expressed GPR17 in different cell lines and found
that stimulation with both uracil nucleotides and cysteinyl-leukotrienes
(CysLTs) resulted in specific and concentration-dependent responses. In
vivo, knockdown of Gpr17 by either CysLT receptor (CYSLTR1; 300201) or
P2Y receptor (e.g., P2RY12; 600515) antagonists or by antisense
technology prevented evolution of brain damage in a rat focal ischemia
model. RT-PCR analysis detected expression of GPR17 in human and rat
organs prone to ischemic damage, including brain, kidney, and heart.
GPR17 appeared to possess 2 distinct binding sites, one for nucleotides
and the other for CysLTs. Ciana et al. (2006) concluded that GPR17 is a
common molecular target that may mediate ischemia and inflammatory
effects induced by nucleotides and CysLTs.

Using mouse cDNAs, Maekawa et al. (2009) showed that Gpr17 downregulated
the function, but not the membrane localization, of the cysteinyl
leukotriene receptor Cyslt1r (CYSLTR1; 300201). Cotransfection of Gpr17
with Cyslt1r suppressed LTD4 binding and inhibited Cyslt1r-mediated Erk
(see MAPK1; 176948) phosphorylation in response to LTD4.
Coimmunoprecipitation studies revealed that Gpr17 and Cyslt1r interacted
directly. Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy revealed colocalization
of GPR17 and CYSLT1R on the surface of human peripheral blood monocytes.
Silencing of Gpr17 in mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages increased
Cyslt1r membrane expression and increased the magnitude and sensitivity
to LTD4-induced calcium flux. Gpr17 deficiency in mice increased
Cyslt1r-mediated vascular permeability in IgE-dependent mast
cell-mediated passive cutaneous anaphylaxis. The vascular leak in
Gpr17-deficient mice was markedly and significantly suppressed by
pharmacologic inhibition of Cyslt1r. Maekawa et al. (2009) concluded
that GPR17 functions as a negative regulator of CYSLT1R.

Mouse hypothalamic neurons expressing Agrp (602311) are involved in
feeding behavior. Ren et al. (2012) found that ablation of Foxo1
(136533) specifically in Agrp-positive hypothalamic neurons resulted in
reduced food intake, leanness, improved glucose homeostasis, and
increased sensitivity to leptin and insulin in mice. Quantitative PCR
and microarray analysis showed that Gpr17 was highly expressed in
Agrp-positive mouse neurons and that Gpr17 expression increased during
fasting. Gpr17 expression was decreased in Foxo1-deficient Agrp-positive
neurons. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis confirmed that Foxo1
bound the Gpr17 promoter. Ren et al. (2012) concluded that
downregulation of Gpr17, at least in part, mediates the anorexigenic
phenotype of Foxo1-deficient Agrp-positive neurons.

GENE STRUCTURE

Blasius et al. (1998) noted that the organization of the GPR17 gene
differs from that of many other GPCRs in that the ORF is distributed on
2 exons, with an additional exon containing the 5-prime UTR.

MAPPING

By analysis of somatic cell hybrids, Raport et al. (1996) mapped the R12
gene to chromosome 2. Blasius et al. (1998) regionalized the HIP4/FB1
gene to chromosome 2q21 using fluorescence in situ hybridization.

140581	TITLE *140581 HEAT-SHOCK TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR 2; HSF2
;;HEAT-SHOCK FACTOR 2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Heat-shock transcription factors activate heat-shock response genes
under conditions of heat or other stresses. Using the partial peptide
sequence of HSF1 (140580) from HeLa cells to screen a human T-cell cDNA
library, Schuetz et al. (1991) isolated HSF2. HSF1 and HSF2 encode
proteins that bind specifically to the heat-shock element and have
homology to HSFs of other species. Schuetz (1991) pointed out that
although the names HSF1 and HSF2 were chosen for historical reasons,
these peptides should be referred to as heat-shock transcription
factors.

Kallio et al. (2002) found that mouse Hsf2 was expressed in all 3
embryonic layers at embryonic day 7.5 and that the head fold was
strongly stained at embryonic day 8.5. At later developmental stages,
Hsf2 expression was progressively limited to the central nervous system.
In adults, Hsf2 expression was detected in spermatocytes and
spermatogonia, but not in elongated spermatids, spermatozoa, or Sertoli
cells.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the HSF2
gene to chromosome 6 (TMAP STS-M65217).

GENE FUNCTION

In contrast to most genomic DNA in mitotic cells, the promoter regions
of some genes, such as the stress-inducible hsp70i gene that codes for a
heat-shock protein, remain uncompacted, a phenomenon known as
bookmarking. Xing et al. (2005) showed that hsp70i bookmarking is
mediated by a transcription factor called HSF2, which binds this
promoter in mitotic cells, recruits protein phosphatase-2A (see 605997),
and interacts with the CAPG subunit of the condensin enzyme (606280) to
promote efficient dephosphorylation and inactivation of condensin
complexes in the vicinity, thereby preventing compaction at this site.
Blocking HSF2-mediated bookmarking by HSF2 RNA interference decreased
hsp70i induction and survival of stressed cells in the G1 phase. Xing et
al. (2005) concluded that this demonstrated the biologic importance of
gene bookmarking.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Mou et al. (2013) screened for exonic mutations in the candidate gene
HSF2 in 766 Chinese men with azoospermic infertility (see 258150) and
identified 1 patient carrying a heterozygous missense mutation (R502H;
140581.0001) with a dominant-negative effect on the wildtype allele. The
authors concluded that their findings supported a role for HSF2 in the
pathogenesis of idiopathic azoospermia.

ANIMAL MODEL

Kallio et al. (2002) found that Hsf2-null mice were born at the expected
mendelian ratio but had brain abnormalities and meiotic and gametogenic
defects in both genders. Enlargement of the lateral and third ventricles
and reduction of the hippocampus and striatum correlated with Hsf2
expression in proliferative cells of the neuroepithelium and in some
ependymal cells in adults. In Hsf2-null males, many developing
spermatocytes were eliminated via apoptosis in a stage-specific manner,
and pachytene spermatocytes displayed structural defects in the
synaptonemal complexes between homologous chromosomes. In Hsf2-null
females, abnormal egg production, reduced ovarian follicle number, and
hemorrhagic cystic follicles were consistent with meiotic defects.
Hsf2-null females also showed hormone response defects that could be
rescued by superovulation treatment, and they showed abnormal
luteinizing hormone receptor mRNA (152790) levels.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
VARIANT OF UNKNOWN SIGNIFICANCE
HSF2, ARG50HIS

This variant is classified as a variant of unknown significance because
its contribution to azoospermia (see 258150) has not been confirmed.

Mou et al. (2013) screened for exonic mutations in the candidate gene
HSF2 (140581) in 766 Chinese men with azoospermic infertility and 521
men with proven fertility, and identified 1 man with a heterozygous
missense mutation, a c.1505G-A transition resulting in an arg502-to-his
(R502H) substitution at a highly conserved residue. The mutation was not
found in the fertile controls, in the dbSNP135 database, or in the 1000
Genomes Project dataset. Functional analysis in HeLa and 293FT cell
lines demonstrated that in contrast to wildtype HSF2, the mutant failed
to activate the HSPA2 (140560) promoter. Coexpression analysis
demonstrated that the R502H mutant inhibited the transcriptional
regulatory activity of the wildtype allele through a dominant-negative
effect. Testicular biopsy from the patient carrying the heterozygous
variant confirmed the diagnosis of nonobstructive azoospermia, and
showed blockage of the spermatogenic process primarily at the
spermatocyte stage. Mou et al. (2013) concluded that their findings
supported a role for HSF2 in the pathogenesis of idiopathic azoospermia.

PSSALRE
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The p34(CDC2) protein kinase (116940) regulates important transitions in
the eukaryotic cell cycle. Using RT-PCR of HeLa cell mRNA with
degenerate primers corresponding to conserved regions of CDC2, Meyerson
et al. (1992) identified cDNAs encoding 7 novel human protein kinases.
They designated one of these proteins PSSALRE, following the accepted
practice of naming cdc2-related kinases based on the amino acid sequence
of the region corresponding to the conserved PSTAIRE motif of CDC2. The
predicted 291-amino acid PSSALRE protein shares 57% identity with CDC2.
The in vitro transcription/translation product has an apparent molecular
weight of 31 kD by SDS-PAGE. Northern blot analysis detected PSSALRE
expression in all human tissues and cell lines tested.

GENE FUNCTION

Cyclin-dependent kinase-5 is predominantly expressed in neurons where it
phosphorylates both high molecular weight neurofilaments (NEFH; 162230)
and microtubule-associated protein tau (157140) (Ohshima et al., 1995).

CDK5 is required for proper development of the mammalian central nervous
system (CNS). To be activated, CDK5 must associate with its regulatory
subunit, p35 (CDK5R1; 603460). Patrick et al. (1999) showed that p25, a
truncated form of p35, accumulates in neurons in the brains of patients
with Alzheimer disease (104300). This accumulation correlated with an
increase in CDK5 kinase activity. Unlike p35, p25 was not readily
degraded, and binding of p25 to CDK5 constitutively activated CDK5,
changed its cellular location, and altered its substrate specificity. In
vivo, the p25/CDK5 complex hyperphosphorylated tau, which reduced tau's
ability to associate with microtubules. Moreover, expression of the
p25/CDK5 complex in cultured primary neurons induced cytoskeletal
disruption, morphologic degeneration, and apoptosis. Patrick et al.
(1999) concluded that cleavage of p35, followed by accumulation of p25,
may be involved in the pathogenesis of cytoskeletal abnormalities and
neuronal death in neurodegenerative diseases.

Bibb et al. (1999) demonstrated that CDK5 can phosphorylate DARPP32
(604399) at threonine-75, converting it into an inhibitor of PKA (see
176911).

Cocaine enhances dopamine-mediated neurotransmission by blocking
dopamine reuptake at axon terminals. Most dopamine-containing nerve
terminals innervate medium spiny neurons in the striatum of the brain.
Cocaine addiction is thought to stem, in part, from neural adaptations
that act to maintain equilibrium by countering the effects of repeated
drug administration. Chronic exposure to cocaine upregulates several
transcription factors that alter gene expression and which could mediate
such compensatory neural and behavioral changes. One such transcription
factor is delta-FosB (164772), a protein that persists in striatum long
after the end of cocaine exposure. Bibb et al. (2001) identified Cdk5 as
a downstream target of delta-FosB by use of DNA array analysis of
striatal material from inducible transgenic mice. Overexpression of
delta-FosB, or chronic cocaine administration, raised levels of Cdk5
mRNA, protein, and activity in the striatum. Moreover, injection of Cdk5
inhibitors into the striatum potentiated behavioral effects of repeated
cocaine administration. Bibb et al. (2001) concluded that changes in
Cdk5 levels mediated by delta-FosB, and resulting alterations in
signaling involving D1 dopamine receptors, contribute to adaptive
changes in the brain related to cocaine addiction.

Wang et al. (2003) showed that transient forebrain ischemia in rat
caused hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neuronal cell death. Ischemia in these
cells led to an increase in p25, which was associated with prolonged
activation of CDK5. Activated CDK5 phosphorylated the NMDA receptor-2A
subunit (NR2A; 138253) at ser1232, resulting in enhanced current
activity through NMDA synaptic receptors. Inhibition of CDK5 or of the
interaction between CDK5 and NR2A protected CA1 pyramidal cells from
ischemic insult. Wang et al. (2003) concluded that modulation of NMDA
receptors by CDK5 is the primary intracellular event underlying ischemic
injury of CA1 pyramidal neurons.

In mice, Smith et al. (2003) showed that administration of MPTP, a toxin
that damages the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway, resulted in an
increase of cdk5 expression and activity. Inhibition of cdk5 attenuated
the loss of dopaminergic neurons caused by MPTP. Smith et al. (2003)
suggested that cdk5 may be a regulator of dopaminergic neuron
degeneration in Parkinson disease (168600).

Xie et al. (2003) found that Fak (PTK2; 600758) phosphorylation by Cdk5
was important for microtubule organization, nuclear movement, and
neuronal migration in cultured mouse neurons. Phosphorylated Fak was
enriched along a centrosome-associated microtubule fork abutting the
nucleus. Overexpression of a nonphosphorylatable Fak mutant resulted in
disorganization of the microtubule fork and impaired nuclear movement in
vitro and a neuronal positioning defect in vivo. Xie et al. (2003)
concluded that CDK5 phosphorylation of FAK is critical for neuronal
migration through regulation of a microtubule fork important for nuclear
translocation.

Phosphorylation of doublecortin (DCX; 300121) is developmentally
regulated in brain, and phosphorylation corresponds to expression of
p35, the major activating subunit for CDK5. Tanaka et al. (2004) found
that Dcx was phosphorylated on ser297 by Cdk5 during mouse brain
development. Phosphorylation lowered the affinity of Dcx to microtubules
in vitro, reduced its effect on polymerization, and displaced it from
microtubules in cultured neurons. In addition, mutation of ser297
blocked the effect of Dcx on neuron migration in a fashion similar to
inhibition of Cdk5 activity. Tanaka et al. (2004) concluded that DCX
phosphorylation by CDK5 regulates its actions on migrating neurons
through an effect on microtubules.

In beta cell-derived MIN6 cells and rat pancreatic islets, Wei et al.
(2005) demonstrated that inhibition of CDK5 enhanced insulin secretion
after stimulation by high concentrations of glucose, and p35-null mice
also showed enhanced insulin secretion in response to a glucose
challenge. In beta cells, CDK5 inhibition increased the Ca(2+) influx
across the L-type voltage-dependent calcium channel (see CACNA1C;
114205) upon stimulation with high glucose, but had no effect without
glucose stimulation. The inhibitory regulation by CDK5 on the beta cell
calcium channel was attributed to the phosphorylation of loop II-III of
CACNA1C at ser783, which prevented binding to SNARE proteins and
subsequently resulted in decreased activity of the channel. Wei et al.
(2005) concluded that CDK5 is part of a signaling cascade in the
regulation of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in pancreatic beta
cells.

Kim et al. (2006) demonstrated that Wave1 (605035) is phosphorylated at
multiple sites by Cdk5 both in vitro and in intact mouse neurons.
Phosphorylation of Wave1 by Cdk5 inhibited its ability to regulate
Arp2/3 complex (604221)-dependent actin polymerization. Loss of Wave1
function in vivo or in cultured neurons resulted in a decrease in mature
dendritic spines. Expression of a dephosphorylation-mimic mutant of
Wave1 reversed this loss of Wave1 function in spine morphology, but
expression of a phosphorylation-mimic mutant did not. Cyclic AMP
signaling reduced phosphorylation of the Cdk5 sites in Wave1 and
increased spine density in a Wave1-dependent manner. Kim et al. (2006)
concluded that phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of WAVE1 in neurons has
an important role in the formation of the filamentous actin
cytoskeleton, and thus in the regulation of dendritic spine morphology.

Choi et al. (2010) showed that obesity induced in mice by high fat
feeding activates the protein kinase CDK5 in adipose tissues. This
results in phosphorylation of the nuclear receptor PPARG (601487), a
dominant regulator of adipogenesis and fat cell gene expression, at
ser273. This modification of PPARG does not alter its adipogenic
capacity, but leads to dysregulation of a large number of genes whose
expression is altered in obesity, including a reduction in the
expression of the insulin-sensitizing adipokine adiponectin (605441).
The phosphorylation of PPARG by CDK5 is blocked by antidiabetic PPARG
ligands such as rosiglitazone and MRL24. This inhibition works both in
vitro and vivo, and is completely independent of classic receptor
transcriptional agonism. Similarly, inhibition of PPARG phosphorylation
in obese patients by rosiglitazone was very tightly associated with the
antidiabetic effects of this drug. Choi et al. (2010) concluded that all
these findings strongly suggested that Cdk5-mediated phosphorylation of
PPARG may be involved in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and
presented an opportunity for development of an improved generation of
antidiabetic drugs through PPARG.

Choi et al. (2011) described novel synthetic compounds that have a
unique mode of binding to PPARG, completely lack classic transcriptional
agonism, and block the CDK5-mediated phosphorylation in cultured
adipocytes and in insulin-resistant mice. Moreover, one such compound,
SR1664, has potent antidiabetic activity without causing the fluid
retention and weight gain that are serious side effects of many of the
PPARG drugs. Also, unlike thiazolidinediones, SR1664 does not interfere
with bone formation in culture. Choi et al. (2011) concluded that new
classes of antidiabetes drugs can be developed by specifically targeting
the CDK5-mediated phosphorylation of PPARG.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ohshima et al. (1995) cloned the mouse cdk5 gene and determined that it
contains 12 exons in a region of approximately 5 kb.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Demetrick et al. (1994) mapped
the CDK5 gene to chromosome 7q36. Ohshima et al. (1995) assigned mouse
cdk5 to the centromeric region of mouse chromosome 5 by interspecific
backcross mapping.

ANIMAL MODEL

Ohshima et al. (1996) generated Cdk5-null mice and found that they
exhibited unique lesions in the central nervous system associated with
perinatal mortality. The brains of Cdk5-null mice lacked cortical
laminar structure and cerebellar foliation. In addition, the large
neurons in the brainstem and in the spinal cord showed chromatolytic
changes with accumulation of neurofilament immunoreactivity. The authors
concluded that Cdk5 is an important molecule for brain development and
neuronal differentiation and suggested that Cdk5 may play critical roles
in neuronal cytoskeleton structure and organization.

Using immunohistochemistry and immunoblot experiments, Nguyen et al.
(2001) found that Cdk5 activity and the p25/p35 (see 603460) ratio were
abnormally elevated in the spinal cord of SOD1(G37R) transgenic mice
(see 147450.0001), a mouse model for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS;
105400). Using different transgenic mouse lines with various SOD1(G37R)
expression levels, Nguyen et al. (2001) observed a correlation between
Cdk5 activity and the longevity of the transgenic mice. Double
immunofluorescence microscopy confirmed that Cdk5 and p25 colocalize
with perikaryal neurofilament accumulations in SOD1(G37R) mutant mice
bred onto a neurofilament mutant background. Nguyen et al. (2001)
hypothesized that perikaryal accumulations of neurofilament proteins in
motor neurons may alleviate ALS pathogenesis in SOD1(G37R) mice by
acting as a phosphorylation sink for Cdk5 activity, thereby reducing the
detrimental hyperphosphorylation of tau and other neuronal substrates.

Cdk5, which is essential for the proper development of the CNS, is also
implicated in numerous complex functions of the adult CNS, such as
synaptic transmission, synaptic plasticity, and neuronal signaling. To
elucidate the molecular roles of Cdk5 in the adult CNS, Hirasawa et al.
(2004) abrogated neuronal expression of Cdk5 in perinatal mice using the
Cre-loxP system. The Cdk5-loxP flanked mice were crossed with the Cre
transgenic mice in which the Cre expression was driven by the Nefh
promoter, resulting in generation of viable Cdk5 conditional knockout
mice with the restricted deletion of the Cdk5 gene in specific neurons
beginning around embryonic day 16.5. Twenty-five percent of the Cdk5
conditional knockout mice carrying the heterozygous Cre allele had
neuronal migration defects confined to brain areas where neuronal
migration continues through the perinatal period. The results indicated
that abrogation of Cdk5 expression in mature neurons results in a viable
mouse model that enables investigation of the molecular roles of Cdk5 in
the adult CNS.

Fu et al. (2005) found reduced Erbb2 (164870) and Erbb3 (190151)
phosphorylation and Erbb2 kinase activity in Cdk5-deficient mouse
skeletal muscle. In addition, Cdk5-null mice displayed morphologic
abnormalities at the pre- and postsynaptic neuromuscular junction, and
intramuscular nerve projections exhibited profuse and anomalous
branching patterns. Acetylcholine receptor clustering was also abnormal.
These abnormalities were accompanied by elevated frequency of miniature
endplate potentials in Cdk5-null diaphragm. Fu et al. (2005) concluded
that CDK5 regulates the development of motor axons and neuromuscular
synapses.

Pareek et al. (2006) found high expression of Cdk5 and p35 in primary
afferent nociceptive C fibers in mouse dorsal root ganglia. Induction of
inflammation in peripheral nerves resulted in increased levels of Cdk5,
p35, and p25. P35-null mice showed delayed responses to painful thermal
stimulation, whereas transgenic mice overexpressing p35 were
hypersensitive to painful stimuli compared to controls. Pareek et al.
(2006) concluded that Cdk/p35 plays a role in primary afferent
nociceptive signaling.

609548	TITLE *609548 LMAN1-LIKE PROTEIN; LMAN1L
;;ERGIC53-LIKE PROTEIN; ERGL
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching an EST database for sequences highly expressed in prostate,
Yerushalmi et al. (2001) identified LMAN1L, which they called ERGL. The
deduced 527-amino acid protein contains an N-terminal signal sequence,
followed by a long extracellular lectin domain, a transmembrane domain,
and a short intracellular domain. ERGL has 1 possible glycosylation site
and 2 possible intracellular phosphorylation sites. The lectin and
transmembrane domains of ERGL share significant similarity with ERGIC53
(LMAN1; 601567). Northern blot analysis detected a strong, broad signal
between 4.4 and 7.5 kb in prostate and spleen, but not in other tissues.
Weaker but distinct 1.8- and 2.0-kb transcripts were detected in
prostate, and a 1.8-kb transcript was detected in spleen. RNA dot blot
analysis showed strongest ERGL expression in prostate, spleen, salivary
gland, and cardiac atrium. Weaker expression was observed in cerebellum,
spinal cord, appendix, adrenal gland, fetal spleen, and testis. PCR
analysis revealed 2 splice variants in prostate and a single variant in
salivary gland and spleen. In situ hybridization detected ERGL in normal
and neoplastic prostate epithelial cells, in acinar and duct epithelial
cells of salivary gland, in neurons and astrocytes of cerebral cortex,
in Purkinje cells of cerebellum, in motor neurons of the spinal cord
ventral horn, and in marginal zones of B-cell follicles in spleen.
Diffuse ERGL expression was detected in cardiac atrial muscle sarcoplasm
and in isolated subendocardial cells, but not in cardiac ventricles.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Yerushalmi et al. (2001) mapped the LMAN1L
gene to chromosome 15q22-q23.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By yeast 2-hybrid screening of a human liver cDNA library using the WD40
repeat region of MAWD (STRAP; 605986) as bait, Iriyama et al. (2001)
obtained a full-length cDNA encoding PBLD, which they called MAWBP. The
deduced protein contains 255 amino acids and is highly conserved from
single-cell to higher eukaryotes. It shares 37% amino acid identity with
the Arabidopsis enzyme Phzf, which catalyzes hydroxylation of
phenazine-1-carboxylic acid to 2-hydroxy-phenazine-1-carboxylic acid.
RT-PCR detected variable expression of MAWBP in all human tissues
examined except skeletal muscle.

;;BS69
BONE MORPHOGENETIC PROTEIN RECEPTOR-ASSOCIATED MOLECULE 1, INCLUDED;
BRAM1, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using adenovirus E1A as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a 16-day
whole mouse embryo cDNA library, followed by screening a human colon
carcinoma cDNA library, Hateboer et al. (1995) cloned ZMYND11, which
they called BS69. The deduced 562-amino acid protein had an apparent
molecular mass of about 69 kD following in vitro transcription and
translation. BS69 contains 2 N-terminal zinc finger motifs, followed by
a nuclear localization signal and a C-terminal E1A-binding domain.
Northern blot analysis detected a 4.7-kb transcript in all mouse tissues
examined, with highest expression in kidney.

Using the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of mouse Bmpr1a (601299)
as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a human placenta cDNA library,
followed by screening a kidney cDNA library and 5-prime RACE, Kurozumi
et al. (1998) cloned a splice variant of BS69 that they designated
BRAM1. The deduced BRAM1 protein contains the C-terminal 186 amino acids
of BS69 preceded by 12 amino acids unique to BRAM1. Northern blot
analysis detected variable expression of 4.4-kb and 1.3-kb transcripts
in all tissues examined. Following transfection in mouse fibroblasts,
BRAM1 localized to the cytoplasm, whereas BS69 localized to the nucleus.

Masselink and Bernards (2000) noted that BS69 contains 3 motifs involved
in transcription regulation: a PHD finger and bromodomain in its
N-terminal half, and a MYND domain at its extreme C terminus. The MYND
domain, which is also present in the BRAM1 variant, is a 2-zinc finger
motif first identified in Drosophila Deaf1 (602635) and human MTG8
(133435).

GENE FUNCTION

By coimmunoprecipitation, Hateboer et al. (1995) confirmed direct
interaction between BS69 and the 289-amino acid isoform of E1A (289R)
following cotransfection in a human cell line; BS69 did not interact
with the shorter 243R E1A isoform. Endogenous BS69 complexed with E1A in
adenovirus-transformed human embryonic kidney cells. C-terminal deletion
mutants of BS69 failed to interact with E1A. BS69 inhibited
transactivation mediated by the 289R E1A protein, but not the 243R E1A
protein. BS69 also suppressed E1A-stimulated transcription of retinoic
acid receptor (see 180240) in COS cells.

Kurozumi et al. (1998) determined that BRAM1 interacts specifically with
the kinase domain of BMPR1A. BS69 did not interact with BMPR1A,
suggesting that the N terminus of BS69 interferes with this interaction.
Further investigation indicated that BRAM1 also interacts with TAB1
(602615). Kurozumi et al. (1998) hypothesized that a ternary complex of
MBPR1A, TAB1, and BRAM1 may be involved in BMP-TAB1-TAK1 (601426)
signaling.

Masselink and Bernards (2000) determined that full transcriptional
repression by BS69 requires the MYND domain. BS69 and BRAM1 interacted
with NCOR (600849) through the MYND domain, but BRAM1 was unable to
repress transcription, indicating that NCOR interaction is necessary but
not sufficient for BS69 repression. Expression of E1A inhibited
repression mediated by BS69.

Ansieau and Leutz (2002) showed that the MYND domain of BS69 interacts
with a conserved PxLxP motif in E1A, the Epstein-Barr virus oncoprotein
EBNA2, and a MYC (190080)-related cellular protein, MGA. The viral
proteins competed with MGA for BS69 binding in a PxLxP-dependent
fashion.

MAPPING

By FISH, Masselink and Bernards (2000) mapped the ZMYND11 gene to
chromosome 10p14.

604089	TITLE *604089 HEMATOPOIETIC CELL SIGNAL TRANSDUCER; HCST
;;DNAX-ACTIVATION PROTEIN 10; DAP10
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Many immune receptors are composed of separate ligand-binding and
signal-transducing subunits. In natural killer (NK) and T cells, Wu et
al. (1999) identified DAP10 as a cell surface adaptor protein in an
activating receptor complex with NKG2D (602893), a receptor for the
stress-inducible and tumor-associated major histocompatibility complex
molecule MICA (600169). Wu et al. (1999) identified an EST with homology
to DAP12 (TYROBP; 604142). The DAP10 cDNA encodes a 93-amino acid type I
membrane protein. Northern blot and RT-PCR analyses detected DAP10
expression as an approximately 500-kb transcript primarily in
hematopoietic cells. Protein immunoblot analysis revealed multiple bands
migrating more slowly than the predicted 10 kD, primarily due to
O-linked glycosylation. Within the DAP10 cytoplasmic domain, an SH2
domain-binding site was capable of recruiting the p85 subunit of the
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (see 171833), providing for
NKG2D-dependent transduction. Thus, NKG2D-DAP10 receptor complexes may
activate NK and T-cell responses against MICA-bearing tumors.
Cotransfection of Flag-DAP10 and NKG2D resulted in surface expression of
both proteins, whereas alone they were minimally expressed. Wu et al.
(1999) concluded that the finding that NKG2D-DAP10 complex is a receptor
for the nonclassical MHC class I molecule MICA and evidence that these
molecules are stress-inducible and broadly expressed in epithelial
tumors suggest that the activating NKG2D-DAP10 complex may be involved
in innate immune surveillance.

GENE FUNCTION

Billadeau et al. (2003) noted that DAP10, which is associated with
NKG2D, lacks an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) in
its cytoplasmic tail. They identified a crucial tyr-ile-asn-met motif in
the DAP10 cytoplasmic tail that couples receptor stimulation to
downstream activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, VAV1 (164875),
Rho family GTPases (see 165390), and phospholipase C (see 600220).
Billadeau et al. (2003) concluded that activation of NKG2D-DAP10
proceeds independently of Syk family protein tyrosine kinases (see
600085) and ITAM-containing subunits, but it is capable of initiating
signals that induce killing.

MAPPING

Wu et al. (1999) reported that the human HCST gene resides on chromosome
19q13.1 in opposite transcriptional orientation to the DAP12 gene. The 2
genes are separated by 130 basepairs.

ANIMAL MODEL

Gilfillan et al. (2002) showed that CD8-positive T cells from
Dap10-deficient mice lacked Nkg2d expression and were unable to mount
tumor-specific responses. In contrast, NK cells from these animals
expressed a functional Nkg2d receptor through association with another
adaptor molecule, Dap12, which recruited protein tyrosine kinases.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Homeobox genes act as master genes that control pattern formation and
positional information during embryonic development. In the adult, they
are thought to maintain the differentiated states of cell populations
and to direct the renewal of specific cell types. While homeobox genes
are widely expressed in the developing vertebrate nervous system, only a
few, including NKX6B, continue to be expressed in the adult brain
(summary by Lee et al., 2001).

CLONING

Nkx6.2 was isolated in mouse by Komuro et al. (1993). Expression of
Nkx6.2 appeared to be tissue specific and developmentally regulated. In
day-18 mouse embryos, it was expressed in part of the forebrain as well
as in mid- and hindbrain, whereas in the adult CNS, expression was most
abundant in areas rich in oligodendrocyte cell bodies and astrocytes.
Together with DNA binding assays, these expression studies suggested
that the Nkx6.2 gene product may be important for differentiated
oligodendrocyte function and in the regulation of myelin gene
expression.

Lee et al. (2001) cloned and characterized NKX6B, the human homolog of
mouse Nkx6.2. The predicted 277-amino acid NKX6B protein shares 97%
identity with mouse Nkx6.2 and 52% homology with NKX6A (602563).
Northern blot analysis showed that NKX6B expression is tightly
controlled in a tissue-specific fashion, with highest expression in
brain.

GENE STRUCTURE

By DNA sequence analysis of an 11-kb genomic fragment, Lee et al. (2001)
demonstrated that the NKX6B gene spans 1.2 kb and contains 3 exons.

MAPPING

Using STS content mapping and radiation hybrid analysis, Lee et al.
(2001) mapped NKX6B gene to 10q26, a region where loss of heterozygosity
has frequently been observed in various malignant brain tumors. Lee et
al. (2001) suggested that NKX6B may be a tumor suppressor gene for brain
tumors, particularly for oligodendrogliomas.

Komuro et al. (1993) mapped the mouse Nkx6b gene to the distal portion
of chromosome 7.

607477	TITLE *607477 G2- AND S-PHASE EXPRESSED GENE 1; GTSE1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database searching for homologs of mouse Gtse1, Monte et al. (2000)
identified an EST for GTSE1 and obtained a full-length clone. The
deduced 720-amino acid protein shares 65% sequence identity with mouse
Gtse1. Western blot analysis of transiently transfected COS-7 cells
revealed an apparent molecular mass of about 110 kD. Transient
transfection of osteosarcoma cells resulted in immunofluorescent
localization of GTSE1 to microtubules and colocalization with tubulin
(see 191130).

GENE FUNCTION

Monte et al. (2000) determined that osteosarcoma cells overexpressing
GTSE1 contained a large subpopulation of cells with 4N DNA, indicative
of a prolonged G2/M phase. Synchronized human fibroblasts expressed
undetectable amounts of GTSE1 mRNA and protein while at rest and at 12
hours following cell cycle reentry. At 24 hours following cell cycle
reentry, however, GTSE1 was expressed along with cyclin B (123836), a
G2-phase marker. Monte et al. (2000) concluded that GTSE1, like its
mouse homolog, is a microtubule-localized protein, is cell cycle
regulated, and can induce G2/M-phase accumulation when overexpressed.

GENE STRUCTURE

Monte et al. (2000) determined that the GTSE1 gene contains 11 exons and
spans about 33 kb. Exon 1 contains the 5-prime untranslated region and
the ATG initiator codon.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Monte et al. (2000) mapped the GTSE1 gene
to chromosome 22q13.2-q13.3. By interspecific test-cross analysis, they
mapped the mouse Gtse1 gene to chromosome 15.

611864	TITLE *611864 ARMADILLO REPEAT-CONTAINING 10; ARMC10
;;SPLICING VARIANT INVOLVED IN HEPATOCARCINOGENESIS; SVH
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By representational difference analysis, followed by database analysis,
and screening a hepatoma cell line cDNA library, Huang et al. (2003)
cloned ARMC10, which they called SVH. The deduced 343-amino acid protein
contains an armadillo repeat, an N-terminal cell attachment sequence, an
N-terminal transmembrane domain, and 3 PKC and 6 casein kinase II
phosphorylation sites. Northern blot analysis detected a major 2.6-kb
transcript in all tissues tested with high expression in placenta,
liver, kidney, heart, and brain. RT-PCR analysis identified 4 splice
variants, resulting from alternative splicing of exons 2 and 5, which
they designated SVHA, SVHB, SVHC, and SVHD. Confocal microscopy and
immunofluorescence studies localized all splice variants to the
endoplasmic reticulum membrane, and the N-terminal transmembrane domain
was required for ER subcellular localization. Quantitative RT-PCR showed
that only SVHB, which lacks exon 2, was upregulated in hepatocellular
carcinoma samples.

GENE FUNCTION

Huang et al. (2003) showed that overexpression of the SVHB variant
accelerated cell growth in a normal liver cell line and promoted tumor
formation in nude mice. Antisense inhibition of SVHB mRNA decreased cell
growth and induced apoptosis in a hepatoma cell line.

GENE STRUCTURE

Huang et al. (2003) determined that the ARMC10 gene contains 7 exons
spanning approximately 25 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Huang et al. (2003) mapped the ARMC10 gene
to chromosome 7q11.2.

;;KIAA0415;;
SPG48 GENE; SPG48
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated human brain cDNA
library, Ishikawa et al. (1997) cloned KIAA0415. The deduced 634-amino
acid protein shares weak similarity with cyclin A1 (CCNA1; 604036).
RT-PCR detected variable KIAA0415 expression in all tissues examined. In
vitro-translated KIAA0415 had an apparent molecular mass of 68 kD by
SDS-PAGE.

Using RNA interference to screen HeLa cells for proteins involved in
homologous recombination DNA double-strand break repair, followed by
database analysis, Slabicki et al. (2010) identified KIAA0415, which
they called SPG48. KIAA0415 has a putative C-terminal helicase domain
characteristic of superfamily 2 (SF2)-type helicases. Western blot
analysis detected 2 possible KIAA0415 isoforms. Cell fractionation
revealed that the shorter isoform was predominantly nuclear, whereas the
longer isoform was predominantly cytoplasmic.

GENE FUNCTION

By immunoprecipitation analysis of HeLa cells, Slabicki et al. (2010)
showed that KIAA0415 exists in a core protein complex containing SPG11
(610844), SPG15 (ZFYVE26; 612012), C20ORF29 (AP5S1; 614824), and
DKFZp761E198 (614367). Knockdown of KIAA0415, C20ORF29, or SPG15 in HeLa
cells reduced homologous recombination in a test substrate, whereas
knockdown of SPG11 or DKFZp761E198 had no effect. Knockdown of KIAA0415
also reduced homologous recombination in U2OS human osteosarcoma cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Slabicki et al. (2010) determined that the KIAA0415 gene contains 17
coding exons.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Ishikawa et al. (1997) mapped the KIAA0415
gene to chromosome 7. Gross (2010) mapped the KIAA0415 gene to
chromosome 7p22.1 based on an alignment of the KIAA0415 sequence
(GenBank GENBANK AB007875) with the genomic sequence (GRCh37).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

By direct sequencing of the KIAA0415 gene in 166 unrelated patients with
unexplained hereditary spastic paraplegia, Slabicki et al. (2010)
identified a homozygous truncating mutation (613653.0001) in 2 affected
French sibs. Another patient with sporadic disease was heterozygous for
a deletion (613653.0002), but a second mutation was not identified. The
phenotype was consistent with adult-onset SPG48 (613647). Studies of
lymphoblastoid cells derived from 1 patient showed increased sensitivity
to DNA-damaging drugs. The findings suggested a link between this form
of spastic paraplegia, which could be considered a neurodegenerative
disease, and defects in DNA repair. Slabicki et al. (2010) studied
KIAA0415 as a candidate gene in this disorder because of its role in a
complex with the other SPG-related genes SPG11 and SPG15.

SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA 48, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
KIAA0415, 4-BP DEL/22-BP INS, NT80

In 2 French sibs with autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia-48 (SPG48;
613647), Slabicki et al. (2010) identified a homozygous complex
insertion/deletion mutation in exon 2 of the KIAA0415 gene. The mutation
comprised a 4-bp deletion (80del4) and a 22-bp insertion (84ins22),
resulting in a frameshift and premature stop codon following residue 29.
The insertion was found to be an imperfect quadruplication of a
sequence, suggesting DNA polymerase slippage during DNA synthesis as the
pathogenetic mechanism. The patients presented with progressive spastic
paraplegia associated with urinary incontinence from ages 50 and 49
years, respectively. One had a normal cerebral MRI, whereas the other
had spinal hyperintensities in the cervical spine. The unaffected
parents were not known to be consanguineous, but they originated from 2
neighboring villages. The mutation was not found in 156 Caucasian or 242
North African control chromosomes. Studies of lymphoblastoid cells
derived from 1 patient showed increased sensitivity to DNA-damaging
drugs. The findings suggested a link between this form of spastic
paraplegia, which could be considered a neurodegenerative disease, and
defects in DNA repair.

gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature termination following
residue 56. No family members were available for study, and no copy
number variations were found on chromosome 7, but a second small change
affecting the KIAA0415 gene could not be completely excluded. The
mutation was not found in 158 Caucasian or 84 North African control
chromosomes.

611993	TITLE *611993 MITOCHONDRIAL RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN S33; MRPS33
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Mitochondria have their own translation system for production of 13
inner membrane proteins essential for oxidative phosphorylation. MRPS33
is a component of the small subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome that
is encoded by the nuclear genome (Koc et al., 2001).

CLONING

By proteolytic digestion of whole bovine 28S subunits, followed by
peptide analysis and EST database analysis, Koc et al. (2001) identified
full-length human MRPS33. The deduced 106-amino acid MRPS33 protein has
a calculated molecular mass of 12.6 kD. Removal of a predicted 26-amino
acid N-terminal mitochondrial localization signal results in a mature
9.7-kD protein. Koc et al. (2001) identified MRPS33 orthologs in mouse,
Drosophila, and C. elegans, but not in yeast or E. coli. Mouse and human
MRPS33 share 80.2% amino acid identity.

GENE STRUCTURE

Zhang and Gerstein (2003) determined that the MRPS33 gene has no introns
in its coding region.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Zhang and Gerstein (2003) mapped the
MRPS33 gene to chromosome 7q32-q34. They identified 4 MRPS33 pseudogenes
scattered throughout the genome.

;;GTPase-ACTIVATING PROTEIN, RHO, 21;;
KIAA1424;;
RHO GTPase-ACTIVATING PROTEIN 10, FORMERLY; ARHGAP10, FORMERLY
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ARHGAP21 functions preferentially as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP)
for CDC42 (116952) and regulates the ARP2/3 complex (604221) and F-actin
dynamics at the Golgi through control of CDC42 activity (Dubois et al.,
2005).

CLONING

By screening an adult brain cDNA library for cDNAs likely to encode
large proteins, Nagase et al. (2000) isolated a partial cDNA encoding
ARHGAP21, which they called KIAA1424. RT-PCR ELISA detected wide
expression of KIAA1424, with highest expression in brain and spinal
cord. Within brain, highest expression was in corpus callosum and
hippocampus, followed by amygdala, cerebellum, caudate nucleus, and
substantia nigra.

By searching databases for potential cytoskeletal proteins, followed by
PCR of a brain cDNA library and RACE, Basseres et al. (2002) obtained a
full-length cDNA encoding ARHGAP21, which they termed ARHGAP10. The
predicted 1,957-amino acid protein contains a pleckstrin homology (PH)
domain, a RHOGAP domain, and a PDZ domain with a glycine-rich
nucleotide-binding P loop. Northern blot analysis revealed wide
expression of a 7.5-kb transcript, with highest expression in brain,
heart, skeletal muscle, and placenta. Expression was variable in several
cancer cell lines.

Using immunoblot and immunofluorescence analyses, Dubois et al. (2005)
found that ARHGAP21 was expressed as a juxtanuclear Golgi complex
protein of more than 250 kD. Its association with the Golgi complex was
reminiscent of ARF1 (103180) distribution.

GENE FUNCTION

Using real-time RT-PCR analysis, Basseres et al. (2002) showed that
hemopoietic stem cells stimulated towards myeloid or erythroid
differentiation had a marked increase in ARHGAP21 expression. They
concluded that ARHGAP21 is a cytoskeletal RHOGAP protein involved in
cell differentiation.

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Dubois et al. (2005) isolated ARHGAP21
via its interaction with activated mutants of ARF6 (600464) and ARF1.
GST pull-down and mutation analyses showed that the interactions
occurred through the PH domain of ARHGAP21. RHOGAP assays indicated that
ARHGAP21 acted preferentially on CDC42 over RHOA (ARHA; 165390) and RAC1
(602048). Small interfering (siRNA) treatment of ARHGAP21 led to
constitutive activation of CDC42 that resulted in actin cytoskeleton
remodeling, suggesting that ARHGAP21 is required for Golgi complex
organization. Loss of ARHGAP21 also caused a massive
activation/recruitment of the ARP2/3 complex in the juxtanuclear region.
Dubois et al. (2005) concluded that ARHGAP21 is a downstream partner of
ARF1 that regulates Golgi structure and function through control of
CDC42 activity.

Alpha-catenin (CTNNA1; 116805) is recruited by beta-catenin (CTNNB1;
116806) after interaction of CTNNB1 with the cytoplasmic domain of
E-cadherin (CDH1; 192090), a receptor for the Listeria monocytogenes
InlA protein. By yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Sousa et al. (2005) identified
ARHGAP21 as a CTNNA1-interacting partner. ARHGAP21 and CTNNA1
colocalized at cell-cell junctions, and ARHGAP21 was recruited to L.
monocytogenes entry sites. Knockdown of ARHGAP21 impaired both L.
monocytogenes entry and CTNNA1 recruitment at cell-cell contacts. In
contrast, overexpression of ARHGAP21 enhanced CTNNA1 levels at cell-cell
junctions and inhibited entry of the bacterium.

GENE STRUCTURE

Basseres et al. (2002) determined that the ARHGAP21 gene contains 25
exons and spans at least 88 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Basseres et al. (2002) mapped the ARHGAP21
gene to chromosome 10p12.32. They identified an intronless copy on
chromosome 6 that may represent a retropseudogene.

603288	TITLE *603288 KERATOCAN; KERA
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Keratan sulfate proteoglycans (KSPGs) are members of the small
leucine-rich proteoglycan (SLRP) family. KSPGs, particularly keratocan,
lumican (600616), and mimecan (602383), are important to the
transparency of the cornea (summary by Funderburgh et al., 1998).

CLONING

Liu et al. (1998) isolated mouse keratocan cDNA and genomic DNA. Mouse
keratocan cDNA predicts a 351-amino acid polypeptide containing a
conserved central leucine-rich repeat region. Northern blot analysis of
mouse tissues revealed that keratocan is expressed selectively in the
eye throughout development. In situ hybridization demonstrated that
keratocan is expressed early in neural crest development and later in
corneal stromal cells.

Tasheva et al. (1999) isolated the cDNA and identified the genomic
structure of the human keratocan gene. An open reading frame starting at
the beginning of the second exon encodes a protein of 352 amino acids.
The amino acid sequence of keratocan shows high identity among mammalian
species. This evolutionary conservation between the keratocan proteins
as well as the restricted expression of the KERA gene in cornea suggests
that this molecule might be important in developing and maintaining
corneal transparency.

GENE STRUCTURE

Tasheva et al. (1999) demonstrated that the human keratocan gene is
spread over 7.65 kb of DNA and contains 3 exons.

MAPPING

Funderburgh et al. (1998) mapped the mouse keratocan gene to distal
mouse chromosome 10, very closely linked to the lumican gene. By
fluorescence in situ hybridization, Tasheva et al. (2000) mapped the
human keratocan gene to 12q22. Pellegata et al. (2000) independently
cloned the human KERA gene and mapped it to 12q.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Pellegata et al. (2000) identified mutations in KERA in 47 patients with
recessive cornea plana (CNA2; 217300). Forty-six Finnish patients were
homozygous for a founder missense mutation (603288.0001), and 1 American
patient was homozygous for a mutation leading to a premature stop codon
that truncates the KERA protein (603288.0002). No mutations in KERA were
identified in CNA1 patients (121400).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CORNEA PLANA 2
KERA, ASN247SER

In 46 Finnish patients with autosomal recessive cornea plana (CNA2;
217300), Pellegata et al. (2000) found homozygosity for an A-to-G
transition resulting in an asparagine-to-serine substitution at codon
247 of the KERA gene (N247S). This amino acid substitution affects the N
residue in the LRR consensus motif, the most highly conserved amino acid
in the LRR motif throughout the SLRP family. This result agreed with the
hypothesis that all Finnish CNA2 patients share a single mutation
inherited from a common founding ancestor. None of 154 grandparents of
CEPH families carried the mutated allele, nor did any of 121 anonymous
blood donors from southern Finland. Among blood donors from northeastern
Finland, where most CNA2 patients originate, Pellegata et al. (2000)
found 2 individuals heterozygous for the mutated allele. A carrier
frequency of 2 in 126 is in agreement with expectations based on disease
incidence.

Sipila and Aula (2002) announced the creation of an up-to-date database
for the mutations of the Finnish disease heritage, i.e., the more than
30 monogenic disorders that are more prevalent in the Finnish population
than in the rest of the world. They noted that all Finnish cases of
cornea plana have had the N247S mutation.

.0002
CORNEA PLANA 2
KERA, GLN174TER

In an American CNA2 (217300) patient of Chinese origin, Pellegata et al.
(2000) identified a homozygous CAG-to-TAG transition in exon 2 that
caused a change of glutamine to a premature termination codon at codon
174 of the KERA gene (Q174X). This was the only genetic change found in
the entire coding region and intron-exon boundaries of the gene. Both
parents were heterozygous for this mutation. The parents were first
cousins.

.0003
CORNEA PLANA 2
KERA, THR215LYS

In a consanguineous pedigree in which cornea plana (217300) cosegregated
with microphthalmia, Lehmann et al. (2001) identified a C-to-A
transversion at codon 215 of the KERA gene, resulting in a thr215-to-lys
(T215K) substitution at the start of a highly conserved leucine-rich
repeat motif. Structural modeling predicted that this mutation altered
the length and position of 1 of these motifs on the beta-sheet array of
keratocan. The authors concluded that normal corneal function is
dependent on the regular spacing of collagen fibrils, and the predicted
alteration of the tertiary structure of KERA is the probable mechanism
of the cornea plana phenotype.

.0004
CORNEA PLANA 2
KERA, ARG313TER

In 5 children with autosomal recessive cornea plana (217300), the
offspring of first-cousin parents of ethnic Arab origin, Khan et al.
(2004) identified homozygosity for a 937C-T transition in exon 3 of the
KERA gene, resulting in a change of arginine to a premature termination
codon at codon 313 (R131X). The resulting truncated protein lacks the
highly conserved eleventh LRR motif of normal keratocan. Both parents
were heterozygous for the mutation, which was absent in a clinically
unaffected sib.

612332	TITLE *612332 LIN7, C. ELEGANS, HOMOLOG OF, C; LIN7C
;;VERTEBRATE LIN7 HOMOLOG 3; VELI3;;
MAMMALIAN LIN7 HOMOLOG 3; MALS3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching EST databases for homologs of C. elegans Lin7, Butz et al.
(1998) identified murine Lin7c, which they called Veli3. The deduced
197-amino acid Veli3 protein has a C-terminal PDZ domain.

By Northern blot analysis, Jo et al. (1999) found that rat Lin7c, which
they called Mals3, showed highest expression in kidney, followed by
brain and liver. Weak expression was detected in thymus and heart, and
no expression was detected in spleen. Mals3 had an apparent molecular
mass of 25 kD by Western blot analysis.

By immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization using antibodies and
cRNAs specific for mouse Mals1 (LIN7A; 603380), Mals2 (LIN7B; 612331),
and Mals3, Misawa et al. (2001) showed that each Mals protein localized
to distinct brain regions. The Mals proteins were predominantly
expressed in both neuronal cell bodies and neuropil, and they were not
detected in most nonneuronal cells in brain.

GENE FUNCTION

Butz et al. (1998) identified a complex of 3 proteins in rat brain that
had the potential to couple synaptic vesicle exocytosis to neuronal cell
adhesion. The 3 proteins were Cask (300172), a protein related to
membrane-associated guanylate kinases (MAGUKs); Mint1 (APBA1; 602414), a
putative vesicular trafficking protein; and the Velis. Cask, Mint1, and
the Velis formed a tight, salt-resistant complex. Butz et al. (1998)
determined that the N-terminal domains of Cask, Mint1, and the Velis
were involved in complex formation, leaving their C-terminal PDZ domains
free to recruit adhesion molecules, receptors, and channels to the
complex. Butz et al. (1998) proposed that the tripartite complex acts as
a nucleation site for the assembly of proteins involved in synaptic
vesicle exocytosis and synaptic junctions.

Jo et al. (1999) found that rat Mals proteins immunoprecipitated with
Psd95 (DLG4; 602887) and NMDA receptor-2B (GRIN2B; 138252) from
solubilized rat cerebral cortex membranes.

Misawa et al. (2001) found that Mals1 -/- Mals2 -/- double-knockout mice
appeared normal and showed normal excitatory synaptic activity in the
CA1 region of the hippocampus. Mals3 expression was upregulated in most
brain regions of the double-knockout mice, suggesting that Mals3 may
compensate for loss of Mals1 and Mals2 expression.

Aartsen et al. (2006) found that Mpp4 -/- mouse retinas showed
downregulation of Psd95 and mislocalization of both Psd95 and Veli3 at
the photoreceptor presynaptic membrane. They proposed that MPP4 may
function as a recruitment factor to organize signal transducers at the
photoreceptor synapse.

Onda et al. (2007) found that the expression of LIN7C was downregulated
in oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC; see 275355) compared with normal
oral keratinocytes. Overexpression of LIN7C in OSCC cells resulted in a
noninvasive phenotype with elevated beta-catenin (CTNNB1; 116806)
expression. In immunodeficient mice, tumor cells expressing LIN7C showed
reduced metastases. Onda et al. (2007) concluded that LIN7C in a tumor
suppressor that functions in the beta-catenin signaling pathway.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Taylor et al. (2006) mapped the LIN7C gene
to chromosome 11p14.1.

609864	TITLE *609864 TRANSMEMBRANE PROTEIN 55A; TMEM55A
;;PHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL 4,5-BISPHOSPHATE 4-PHOSPHATASE, TYPE II
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TMEM55A catalyzes the degradation of phosphatidylinositol
4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns-4,5-P2) by removing the 4-phosphate
(Ungewickell et al., 2005).

CLONING

By searching a database for genes encoding proteins similar to
Burkholderia pseudomallei virulence factor BopB, a putative phosphatase,
Ungewickell et al. (2005) identified TMEM55A. The deduced 300-amino acid
protein contains a central Cx(5)R phosphatase catalytic motif and 2
transmembrane domains near its C terminus, a characteristic of lysosomal
transmembrane proteins. RNA dot blot analysis detected expression in all
tissues examined. Fluorescence-tagged TMEM55A localized with membrane
markers of late endosomes or lysosomes.

GENE FUNCTION

Ungewickell et al. (2005) assayed the phosphatase activity of TMEM55A
synthesized in insect cells and found that it specifically catalyzed
removal of the 4-phosphate from PtdIns-4,5-P2. It showed no activity
toward other phosphatidylinositol substrates or inositol phosphates
tested.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Ungewickell et al. (2005) mapped the
TMEM55A gene to chromosome 8q21.3.
