DESCRIPTION Kuefer et al. (1996) described a cDNA whose predicted 248-amino acid
protein sequence is approximately 40% identical to myeloid leukemia
factor 1 (601402). Expression of MLF2 was ubiquitous. Kuefer et al.
(1996) mapped the gene by fluorescence in situ hybridization to 12p13, a
region associated with translocations in acute leukemias of lymphoid and
myeloid origin. However, they found no alterations in the structure of
the MLF2 locus in patients shown to have 12p translocations.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The antiinflammatory action of glucocorticoids has been attributed to
the induction of a group of proteins, collectively called lipocortin,
that inhibit phospholipase A2. These proteins are thought to control the
biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation, prostaglandins and
leukotrienes, by inhibiting release of their common precursor,
arachidonic acid, a process that requires hydrolysis of phospholipids by
phospholipase A2. Lipocortin-like proteins have been isolated from
monocytes, neutrophils, renal medullary cells, and other cell types. The
predominant active form has an apparent relative molecular mass of
40,000. Partially purified lipocortin mimics the effect of steroids and
mediates antiinflammatory activity in various in vivo model systems.
Using amino acid sequence information from purified rat lipocortin,
Wallner et al. (1986) cloned cDNA for human lipocortin and expressed the
gene in E. coli. They confirmed that LPC is a potent inhibitor of
phospholipase A2. Lipocortin I belongs to the family of annexins, which
are structurally related proteins that have a molecular mass of
approximately 35,000 to 40,000. They undergo Ca(2+)-dependent binding to
phospholipids that are preferentially located on the cytosolic face of
the plasma membrane. The individual proteins in this family have been
discovered by investigators with various goals in mind and have been
given a variety of names (Kaplan et al., 1988).

Horlick et al. (1991) isolated overlapping mouse genomic clones for
Lipo1. The gene in the mouse encodes a protein of 346 amino acid
residues.

GENE STRUCTURE

Horlick et al. (1991) demonstrated that the mouse Lipo1 gene spans about
17 kb and is divided into 13 exons. Horlick et al. (1991) pointed out a
similarity in gene structure between mouse Lipo1 and Lipo2 (151740),
suggesting that they have a recent evolutionary ancestor.

GENE FAMILY

Crompton et al. (1988) reviewed the lipocortin/calpactin family of
proteins. Pepinsky et al. (1988) described the characteristics of 3
proteins they called lipocortin III, lipocortin V, and lipocortin VI.
Lipocortins III and IV are apparently identical. Shohat et al. (1989)
advanced the hypothesis that familial Mediterranean fever (FMF; 249100)
patients are homozygous for a mutant allele for one of the lipocortin
genes.

MAPPING

Huebner et al. (1987, 1988) mapped the ANXA1 gene to 9q11-q22 by
chromosomal in situ hybridization and segregation analysis in somatic
cell hybrids using a cDNA clone. By analysis of recombinant inbred
strains, Horlick et al. (1991) showed that the Lipo1 gene is located on
mouse chromosome 19.

GENE FUNCTION

Walther et al. (2000) showed that ANXA1 acts through the formyl peptide
receptor (FPR; 136537) on human neutrophils. Peptides derived from the
unique N-terminal domain of ANXA1 serve as FPR ligands and trigger
different signaling pathways in a dose-dependent manner. Lower peptide
concentrations possibly found in inflammatory situations elicit Ca(2+)
transients without fully activating the mitogen-activated protein kinase
pathway. This causes a specific inhibition of the transendothelial
migration of neutrophils and a desensitization of neutrophils toward a
chemoattractant challenge. These findings identified ANXA1 peptides as
novel, endogenous FPR ligands and established a mechanistic basis of
ANXA1-mediated antiinflammatory effects.

Perretti et al. (2002) reported that inhibition of polymorphonuclear
neutrophil infiltration by aspirin and dexamethasone is a property
shared by aspirin-triggered lipoxins and the glucocorticoid-induced
ANXA1-derived peptides that are both generated in vivo and act at the
lipoxin A4 receptor (FPRL1; 136538) to halt polymorphonuclear neutrophil
diapedesis. These structurally diverse ligands specifically interact
directly with recombinant human ALXR demonstrated by specific
radioligand binding and function as well as immunoprecipitation of
polymorphonuclear neutrophil receptors. In addition, the combination of
both aspirin-triggered lipoxins and ANXA1-derived peptides limited
polymorphonuclear neutrophil infiltration and reduced production of
inflammatory mediators (i.e., prostaglandins and chemokines) in vivo.
Perretti et al. (2002) concluded that the results indicated functional
redundancies in endogenous lipid and peptide antiinflammatory circuits
that are spatially and temporally separate, where both aspirin-triggered
lipoxins and specific ANXA1-derived peptides act in concert at ALXR to
downregulate polymorphonuclear neutrophil recruitment to inflammatory
loci.

Oh et al. (2004) described a hypothesis-driven, systems biology approach
to identifying a small subset of proteins induced at the tissue-blood
interface that are inherently accessible to antibodies injected
intravenously. They used subcellular fractionation, subtractive
proteomics, and bioinformatics to identify endothelial cell surface
proteins exhibiting restricted tissue distribution and apparent tissue
modulation. Expression profiling and gamma-scintigraphic imaging with
antibodies established 2 of these proteins, aminopeptidase-P (602443)
and annexin A1, as selective in vivo targets for antibodies in lung and
solid tumors, respectively. Radioimmunotherapy to annexin A1 destroyed
tumors and increased animal survival.

Using mice in 3 distinct models of T cell-mediated inflammation, Yang et
al. (2013) showed that AnxA1 deficiency significantly increased
antigen-induced T cell proliferation and the resulting inflammation. In
a contact hypersensitivity model, there was increased adhesion of T
cells, including those expressing Ror-gamma-t (RORC; 602943) and IL17a
(603149), and neutrophils in the dermal microvasculature. In
collagen-induced arthritis, susceptibility was increased as was
antigen-specific T cell activation. In delayed hypersensitivity, there
was increased release of IL17 and Ifng (147570). Transfer of AnxA1 -/- T
cells to wildtype mice resulted in increased inflammatory responses.
Yang et al. (2013) concluded that T cell-expressed AnxA1 attenuates T
cell-driven inflammatory responses via effects on intracellular
signaling, proliferation, and Th1/Th17 cytokine release.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

3-Hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (HADH; EC 1.1.1.35) catalyzes the
reversible dehydrogenation of 3-hydroxyacyl-CoAs to their corresponding
3-ketoacyl-CoAs with concomitant reduction of NAD to NADH and exerts it
highest activity toward 3-hydroxydecanoyl-CoA (He et al., 1989).

CLONING

L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase was first purified from pig heart by
Noyes and Bradshaw (1973, 1973). The mature subunit of HADH from pig
heart is 302 amino acids long, corresponding to a molecular weight of 33
kD.

Vredendaal et al. (1996) screened a human liver cDNA library with a PCR
product obtained by degenerate PCR using primers based on the pig heart
HADH amino acid sequence reported by Bitar et al. (1980). Human HADH
encodes a deduced 314-amino acid protein composed of a 12-residue
mitochondrial import signal peptide and a 302-residue mature HADH
protein with a calculated molecular mass of 34.3 kD. The sequence of the
mature protein shows 94% identity with HADH from pig heart. Northern
blot analysis revealed expression of HADH in liver, kidney, pancreas,
heart, and skeletal muscle.

GENE STRUCTURE

Vredendaal et al. (1998) determined that the human HADH gene contains 8
exons and spans approximately 49 kb.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Vredendaal et al. (1996) mapped
the human HADH gene to chromosome 4q22-q26.

- Pseudogene

Vredendaal et al. (1998) identified a putative HADH pseudogene on
chromosome 15q17-q21.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a patient with HADH deficiency (231530) presenting as fulminant
hepatic failure, O'Brien et al. (2000) identified compound
heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the HADH gene (601609.0001;
601609.0002).

In patients with hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia (HHF4; 609975), Clayton
et al. (2001) and Molven et al. (2004) identified mutations in the HADH
gene (601609.0003, 601609.0004).

In 11 (10%) of 115 unrelated patients with diazoxide-responsive
hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia who were negative for mutation in the
hyperinsulinemia-associated genes ABCC8 (600509), KCNJ11 (600937), GCK
(138079), and HNF4A (600281), Flanagan et al. (2011) identified
homozygous mutations in the HADH gene (see, e.g., 601609.0005 and
601609.0006). When DNA was available, carrier status was confirmed in
the unaffected parents; none of the probands had an affected sib.

In a Turkish proband with diazoxide-responsive hyperinsulinemic
hypoglycemia mapping to chromosome 4q25, in whom no coding mutation in
the HADH gene had been found but who showed a reduction in HADH activity
in cultured skin fibroblasts, Flanagan et al. (2013) performed
next-generation sequencing of the entire genomic region of HADH and
identified homozygosity for a deep intronic splicing variant
(636+471G-T; 601609.0007). Screening for the variant in an additional 56
consanguineous and/or Turkish diazoxide-responsive HHF probands revealed
homozygosity for 636+471G-T in 8 more Turkish probands. All 9
mutation-positive Turkish patients were also homozygous for the
636+385A-G SNP (dbSNP rs732941), and 5 of the patients were known to
share a 1.6-Mb haplotype at chromosome 4q25. Flanagan et al. (2013)
stated that the 636+471G-T Turkish founder mutation was the most common
HADH mutation in their cohort and accounted for 9 (32%) of 28
individuals with HADH mutations.

NOMENCLATURE

Yang et al. (2005) discussed the confusion in the literature between the
nomenclature of 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (HADH) and short-chain
3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SCHAD; 300256). Although Vredendaal et
al. (1996) asserted that 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase exerted high
activity towards 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA, and thus referred to the enzyme
as a 'short-chain' dehydrogenase, He et al. (1989) demonstrated that the
enzyme had greater activity for 3-hydroxydecanoyl-CoA, a medium-chain
substrate. Yang et al. (2005) stated that the enzyme encoded by the HADH
gene should not be referred to as SCHAD. Accordingly, some cases of
human metabolic disorders previously reported as 'SCHAD deficiency'
(e.g., Tein et al., 1991; Bennett et al., 1996; Treacy et al., 2000;
Clayton et al., 2001) are in fact cases of 'HADH deficiency' (231530).

HADH, ALA28THR

In a patient with HADH deficiency (231530), O'Brien et al. (2000)
identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the HADH gene: a
118G-A transition in exon 1, resulting in an ala28-to-thr (A28T)
substitution, and a 171C-A transversion in exon 2, resulting in an
asp45-to-glu (D45E; 601609.0002) substitution.

HYPERINSULINEMIC HYPOGLYCEMIA, FAMILIAL, 4
HADH, PRO258LEU

In an Indian child with severe hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia (609975),
Clayton et al. (2001) identified a homozygous 773C-T transition in exon
7 of the HADH gene, resulting in a pro258-to-leu (P258L) substitution in
1 of the alpha-helices of the C-terminal domain. The mutation was
predicted to prevent normal protein folding. In vitro functional
expression studies showed that the mutant enzyme had no catalytic
activity. The parents were heterozygous for the mutation. Clayton et al.
(2001) postulated that the increased insulin secretion in this patient
was related to impaired fatty acid oxidation and suggested that a lipid
signaling pathway may be involved in the control of insulin secretion by
pancreatic beta-cells.

.0004
HYPERINSULINEMIC HYPOGLYCEMIA, FAMILIAL, 4
HADH, 6-BP DEL

In an inbred Pakistani family previously reported by Vidnes and
Oyasaeter (1977) in which 4 sibs, 2 males and 2 females, had
hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia (609975), Molven et al. (2004)
demonstrated a 6-bp deletion that removed the acceptor splice site
adjacent to exon 5 of the HADH gene. They demonstrated that exon 5 is
skipped during the mRNA splicing process, so that exon 4 is coupled
directly onto exon 6. This led to an in-frame deletion of 90 nucleotides
in the mature mRNA, resulting in a protein product predicted to lack 30
amino acids. Both parents were heterozygous.

.0005
HYPERINSULINEMIC HYPOGLYCEMIA, FAMILIAL, 4
HADH, ARG236TER

In 6 unrelated children with hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia (HHF4;
609975), 3 from Turkey, 2 from Iran, and 1 from Pakistan, Flanagan et
al. (2011) identified homozygosity for a 706C-T transition in exon 6 of
the HADH gene, resulting in an arg236-to-ter (R236X) substitution. When
DNA was available, carrier status was confirmed in the unaffected
parents; none of the probands had an affected sib. Flanagan et al.
(2011) noted that the R236X mutation had previously been reported in a
patient with hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia (Di Candia et al., 2009).

.0006
HYPERINSULINEMIC HYPOGLYCEMIA, FAMILIAL, 4
HADH, EX1DEL

In 2 unrelated boys from India with hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia (HHF4;
609975), Flanagan et al. (2011) identified homozygosity for deletion of
the minimal promoter and exon 1 (1-3440_132 + 1943del) in the HADH gene.
When DNA was available, carrier status was confirmed in the unaffected
parents; neither of the probands had an affected sib.

.0007
HYPERINSULINEMIC HYPOGLYCEMIA, FAMILIAL, 4
HADH, IVS5, G-T, +471

In 9 Turkish probands with diazoxide-responsive hyperinsulinemic
hypoglycemia (HHF4; 609975), 3 of whom were previously studied by
Flanagan et al. (2011), Flanagan et al. (2013) identified homozygosity
for a 636+471G-T transition deep within intron 5 of the HADH gene,
creating a cryptic splice donor site that results in the inclusion of an
out-of-frame 141-bp pseudoexon and premature termination. The mutation
was present in heterozygosity in tested parents. All 9 mutation-positive
Turkish patients were also homozygous for an HADH SNP, 636+385A-G (dbSNP
rs732941), and 5 of the patients were known to share a 1.6-Mb haplotype
at chromosome 4q25 (Chr4:108,874,712-108,968,640; GRCh37). Flanagan et
al. (2013) stated that the 636+471G-T Turkish founder mutation was the
most common HADH mutation in their cohort and accounted for 9 (32%) of
28 individuals with HADH mutations.

T2R48
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TAS2R19 belongs to a family of intronless genes that encode highly
related bitter taste receptors (TAS2Rs). TAS2Rs are G protein-coupled
receptors, which are characterized by 7 transmembrane domains (summary
by Fischer et al., 2005). For further information on the TAS2R gene
family, see 604791.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Fischer et al. (2005) mapped the TAS2R19
gene, which they called T2R48, to a TAS2R gene cluster on chromosome
12p13.

600018	TITLE *600018 OPIOID RECEPTOR, MU-1; OPRM1
;;OPRM;;
MU OPIOID RECEPTOR; MOR;;
MOR1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The OPRM1 gene encodes the mu opioid receptor, which is the primary site
of action for the most commonly used opioids, including morphine,
heroin, fentanyl, and methadone. It is also the primary receptor for
endogenous opioid peptides beta-endorphin (see POMC, 176830) and the
enkephalins (see PENK, 131330). The OPRM1 receptor is a membrane of the
G protein-coupled receptor family (Bond et al., 1998). There are at
least 3 types of opioid receptors, mu, kappa (OPRK1; 165196), and delta
(OPRD1; 165195), each with a distinct pharmacologic profile (Chen et
al., 1993).

CLONING

Chen et al. (1993) cloned cDNAs for the mu receptor from rat brain. They
demonstrated that this receptor, like the kappa-opioid receptor,
possesses a putative secondary structure of 7 transmembrane domains
common to G protein-coupled receptors and displays functional coupling
to adenylyl cyclase.

Using rat mu opiate receptor cDNA to screen a human cerebral cortex cDNA
library, Wang et al. (1994) cloned OPRM1, which they called MOR1. The
deduced 400-amino acid protein contains 5 N-glycosylation sites near the
N terminus, followed 7 transmembrane domains spread throughout the
molecule.

Cadet et al. (2003) identified an OPRM1 splice variant that they termed
mu-3. The deduced protein contains 434 amino acids. Northern blot
analysis detected a 1.3-kb mu-3 transcript in heart endothelium and
leukocytes.

Pan et al. (2003) cloned 2 OPRM splice variants that they termed MOR1O
and MOR1X. Both have alternative exons (exons O and X, respectively).

Pan (2005) reviewed the complex splicing of the mouse, rat, and human
OPRM1 genes. Of the 12 splice variants of human OPRM1 he reported, 10
differ at their 3-prime ends and encode proteins with different C
termini, which alters the kinase that can phosphorylate them. The other
2 human variants are mu-3 and MOR1S, which lacks the internal exons 2
and 3.

Shabalina et al. (2009) cloned 2 OPRM1 splice variants that they termed
MOR1K1 and MOR1K2. The longer MOR1K1 variant is preferentially expressed
in the medulla oblongata, while the shorter MOR1K2 variant is
preferentially expressed in the spinal cord. Both variants are present
in the frontal lobe and nucleus accumbens. The MOR1K isoforms encode a
truncated OPRM1 protein that lacks the extracellular N-terminal domain
and transmembrane domain I. The transcriptional start site was mapped to
an OPRM1 promoter region upstream of exon 13.

GENE STRUCTURE

Shabalina et al. (2009) characterized an expanded human OPRM1 gene with
additional promoters, alternative exons, and regulatory elements. They
determined that the OPRM1 gene contains 18 exons, which they designated
from 5-prime to 3-prime as exons 11, 1, T, 14, 13, 2, 3, R, Y, 16, X,
17, 5, 4, 18, 6, O/7, and 9.

MAPPING

Using multilocus cross analysis in the mouse, Kozak et al. (1994)
located the mu receptor gene, Oprm, to chromosome 10. Since the kappa
receptor gene, Oprk1, maps to chromosome 1, the 2 opioid receptors must
represent different gene products and not the product of differential
splicing from the same gene. Oprm is located in a region of chromosome
10 that is homologous to 6q. Wang et al. (1994) isolated an 18-kb
genomic clone and showed by in situ hybridization that the OPRM1 gene
maps to chromosome 6q24-q25. They identified an MspI polymorphism and
suggested that it might be useful in assessing the involvement of the
gene in neuropsychiatric disorders.

GENE FUNCTION

Wang et al. (1994) found that human MOR1 expressed in COS cells bound
with high affinity to a mu opiate-specific ligand. Binding between MOR1
and the ligand was disrupted by related opiate drugs and peptides and
was sensitive to sodium and GTP.

Mansour et al. (1995) demonstrated that immunoreactive fibers and/or
perikarya to polyclonal antibodies generated to the C terminal 63 amino
acids of the cloned mu receptor are distributed widely in the central
nervous system of the rat.

Using positron emission tomography and radioactive carfentanil, a
selective OPRM1 radiotracer, and by following up with magnetic resonance
imaging and the McGill Pain Questionnaire, Zubieta et al. (2001)
examined the function of the opioid system and mu opioid receptors in
individuals exposed to placebo and sustained pain applied to the jaw
muscles. They observed an increased release of endogenous opioids
blocking the OPRM1 sites in the ipsilateral amygdala and in the
contralateral ventrolateral portion of the thalamus. The interaction
with OPRM1 was associated with attenuation of the sensory and
pain-specific affective responses to a sustained painful stimulus.

He et al. (2002) demonstrated that DAMGO, a hydrolysis-resistant
derivative of enkephalin (see 131330), can facilitate the ability of
morphine to stimulate OPRM1 endocytosis. As a consequence, rats treated
chronically with both drugs showed reduced analgesic tolerance compared
to rats treated with morphine alone. These results demonstrated that
endocytosis of OPRM1 can reduce the development of tolerance and
suggested an approach for the development of opiate analogs with
enhanced efficacy for the treatment of chronic pain.

Cadet et al. (2003) found that the mu-3 OPRM variant selectively
responded to opiate alkaloids, releasing nitric oxide in response to
morphine. The mu-3 variant was insensitive to opioid peptides.

Pan et al. (2003) found that the MOR1O and MOR1X OPRM splice variants
showed high selectivity for mu opioids in binding assays.

Zubieta et al. (2003) examined the influence of a common functional
genetic polymorphism, the val158-to-met allele of COMT (116790.0001),
which affects the metabolism of catecholamines, on the modulation of
responses to sustained pain in humans. Individuals homozygous for the
met158 allele showed diminished regional mu opioid system responses to
pain compared with heterozygotes. These effects were accompanied by
higher sensory and affective ratings of pain and a more negative
internal affective state. Opposite effects were observed in the val158
homozygotes. Zubieta et al. (2003) concluded that the COMT val158-to-met
polymorphism influences the human experience of pain and may underlie
interindividual differences in the adaptation and responses to pain and
other stressful stimuli.

Paradoxically, morphine fails to promote desensitization and endocytosis
of MOR, processes that typically contribute to tolerance with other
receptors. Finn and Whistler (2001) showed that replacing the
cytoplasmic tail of mouse Mor with that of the delta opioid receptor
facilitated endocytosis and led to reduced development of cellular
tolerance and cAMP superactivation, a cellular hallmark of withdrawal.
Furthermore, mutant receptors with reduced endocytosis produced
exacerbated superactivation. Finn and Whistler (2001) concluded that
receptor endocytosis plays a critical role in the development of adverse
side effects associated with prolonged opiate use.

Agirregoitia et al. (2006) studied the expression and localization of
delta (OPRD1; 165195), kappa (OPRK1; 165196), and mu (OPRM1) opioid
receptors on human spermatozoa and the implication in sperm motility.
These receptors are located in different parts of the head, in the
middle region, and in the tail of the sperm. Progressive motility of
spermatozoa, an important parameter to evaluate male fertility, was
significantly reduced after incubation with the mu receptor agonist
morphine, whereas this effect was antagonized in the presence of the
corresponding antagonist naloxone. The delta receptor antagonist
naltrindole significantly reduced progressive motility immediately after
its addition. However, the delta receptor agonist DPDPE had no
significant effect. Finally, neither the kappa receptor agonist U50488
nor its antagonist norbinaltorphimine significantly affected the
progressive motility of human spermatozoa.

Duraffourd et al. (2012) found that Mor present in rodent nerves and
portal vein walls responded to infused or dietary peptides and regulated
intestinal gluconeogenesis and satiety.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Mogil (1999) and Uhl et al. (1999) reviewed the genetic basis of
individual differences in sensitivity to pain and its inhibition, and
suggested that the mu opiate receptor may be a candidate gene for
variation in pain perception and response to opioids. They noted that
there are differences between human individuals and between mouse
strains in levels of mu opiate receptor expression, responses to painful
stimuli, and responses to opiate drugs.

Hoehe et al. (2000) used a multiplex sequence comparison method to test
the potential role of OPRM1 in substance (heroin/cocaine) dependence
(see susceptibility to opioid dependence, 610064) in 250 cases and
controls. A total of 43 variants were identified within coding and
noncoding regions of the OPRM1 gene, and 52 different haplotypes were
predicted in the subgroup of 172 African Americans. These haplotypes
were classified by similarity clustering into functionally related
categories, one of which was significantly more frequent in
substance-dependent individuals. Common to this category was a
characteristic pattern of sequence variants [-1793T-A, -1699insT,
-1320A-G, -111C-T, +17C-T(A6V)], which was associated with substance
dependence.

Among 318 European American individuals with substance dependence
(opioid and alcohol dependence; 103780) and 179 controls, Luo et al.
(2003) found a significant difference in haplotype frequency of alleles
at the OPRM1 locus (p = 0.0036). Allele -2044C-A, in the 5-prime
putative regulatory region, and haplotypes that included -2044C-A were
the susceptibility allele and haplotypes, respectively, associated with
substance dependence. However, similar associations were not found among
124 African Americans with substance abuse and 55 African American
controls. The findings suggested that OPRM1 may play a role in the
pathophysiology of substance dependence and that the role is
population-specific.

Befort et al. (2001) investigated whether the mutations asn40 to asp
(N40D; dbSNP rs1799971; 600018.0001) in the extracellular N-terminal
region, asn152 to asp (N152D) in the third transmembrane domain, and
arg265 to his (R265H) and ser268 to pro (S268P) in the third
intracellular loop (Hoehe et al., 2000) altered functional properties
when the receptor was expressed in COS cells. Binding analysis
determined that affinities to structurally diverse opioids and opioid
peptides were not markedly different in the mutant receptors. However,
Scatchard analysis showed that expression of N152D was significantly
lower than that of the wildtype receptor. Binding and reporter gene
analysis indicated that both mutations in the third intracellular loop,
particularly S268P, impair signaling along the cAMP signaling cascade.
Given the ability of OPRM1 antagonists to alter drug and alcohol
dependence, Befort et al. (2001) proposed that examination of patients
expressing S268P from one or both alleles may illuminate the functional
consequences of decreased OPRM1 receptor function in humans.

Wang et al. (2001) studied 3 SNPs causing amino acid substitutions in
the third intracellular loop of MOR: S268P, R265H, and arg260 to his
(R260H). The 3 variants and wildtype MOR responded comparably to
morphine in terms of G protein coupling. However, spontaneous
agonist-independent (basal) MOR signaling, which is thought to play a
role in opioid tolerance and dependence, was significantly reduced in
the R260H and R265H variants. Furthermore, the R265H and R268H variants
showed deficient calmodulin (see CALM1; 114180) binding. Wang et al.
(2001) suggested that carriers of these 3 variants, which all show
substantial changes in basal G protein coupling, calmodulin binding, or
both, may display altered response to narcotic analgesics.

Hao et al. (2004) conducted a large-scale case-control study exploring
the associations of 426 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with
preterm delivery (PTD) in 300 mothers with PTD and 458 mothers with term
deliveries. Twenty-five candidate genes were included in the final
haplotype analysis. Gene haplotypes at IL1R2 (147811) in blacks, NOS2A
(163730) in whites, and OPRM1 in Hispanics were only associated with PTD
in these specific ethnic groups.

By haplotype analysis, Shabalina et al. (2009) identified a novel C-T
variant (dbSNP rs563649) in the 5-prime untranslated region of the MOR1K
isoforms that was the strongest individual contributor to measured pain
sensitivity responses in 196 pain-free Europan American females. The C-T
variant is located within a structurally conserved internal ribosome
entry site (IRES) upstream of exon 13 and affects both mRNA levels and
translation efficiency of MOR1K isoforms. Strong linkage disequilibrium
was identified between dbSNP rs563649 and dbSNP rs1799971, and the minor
T allele of dbSNP rs563649 tagged a 6-SNP (AGTCTG) haplotype associated
with high pain sensitivity. Shabalina et al. (2009) proposed an
essential role for MOR1K isoforms in nociceptive signaling and suggested
that genetic variations in alternative OPRM1 isoforms may contribute to
individual differences in opiate responses.

For a discussion of a possible association between variation in the
OPRM1 gene and susceptibility to idiopathic generalized epilepsy, see
600669.

EVOLUTION

Human evolution is characterized by a dramatic increase in brain size
and complexity. To probe its genetic basis, Dorus et al. (2004) examined
the evolution of genes involved in diverse aspects of nervous system
biology. These genes, including OPRM1, displayed significantly higher
rates of protein evolution in primates than in rodents. This trend was
most pronounced for the subset of genes implicated in nervous system
development. Moreover, within primates, the acceleration of protein
evolution was most prominent in the lineage leading from ancestral
primates to humans. Dorus et al. (2004) concluded that the phenotypic
evolution of the human nervous system has a salient molecular correlate,
i.e., accelerated evolution of the underlying genes, particularly those
linked to nervous system development.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Manglik et al. (2012) described the 2.8-angstrom crystal structure of
the mouse mu-opioid receptor in complex with an irreversible morphinan
antagonist. Compared to the buried binding pocket observed in most G
protein-coupled receptors published so far, the morphinan ligand binds
deeply within a large solvent-exposed pocket. Of particular interest,
the mu-opioid receptor crystallizes as a 2-fold symmetrical dimer
through a 4-helix bundle motif formed by transmembrane segments 5 and 6.

ANIMAL MODEL

Matthes et al. (1996) found that heterozygous or homozygous
Oprm1-knockout mice had no obvious morphologic abnormalities and no
overt behavioral abnormalities. Lack of the receptor abolished the
analgesic effect of morphine, as well as physical dependence, in mutant
mice. The findings indicated that Oprm1 is the molecular target of
morphine in vivo.

Moles et al. (2004) reported that mu opioid receptor knockout mouse pups
emit fewer ultrasonic vocalizations when removed from their mothers but
not when exposed to cold or male mice odors. Moreover these knockout
pups do not show a preference toward their mothers' cues and do not show
ultrasonic calls potentiation after brief maternal exposure. Moles et
al. (2004) concluded that their results from this study may indicate a
molecular mechanism for diseases characterized by deficits in attachment
behavior, such as autism or reactive attachment disorder. Gernsbacher et
al. (2005) questioned the validity of Moles et al. (2004) assertion that
autism is a deficit in attachment behavior.

Rousseaux et al. (2007) found that the probiotic bacterial strain
Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM induced a sustained increase of OPRM1 and
cannabinoid receptor-2 (CNR2; 605051) mRNA expression in human
intestinal epithelial cells. In vivo experiments in mice and rats
revealed that oral administration of L. bacillus NCFM induced colonic
expression of OPRM1 and CNR2 and, in studies in rats, decreased normal
visceral perception with a 20% increase in the pain threshold as
elicited by colorectal distention. In a rat model of chronic colonic
hypersensitivity that mimics irritable bowel syndrome, oral
administration of NCFM resulted in an antinocioceptive effect of the
same magnitude as that caused by the subcutaneous administration of 1 mg
per kg of morphine. NCFM-induced analgesia was significantly inhibited
by peritoneal administration of a CNR2-selective antagonist but not by
an opioid receptor antagonist. Rousseaux et al. (2007) concluded that
direct contact of NCFM with epithelial cells can induce OPRM1 and CNR2
expression and can contribute to modulation and restoration of the
normal perception of visceral pain.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
RECLASSIFIED - VARIANT OF UNKNOWN SIGNIFICANCE
OPRM1, 118A-G, ASN40ASP (dbSNP rs1799971)

This variant, formerly titled RESPONSE TO MORPHINE-6-GLUCURONIDE and
SUSCEPTIBILITY TO OPIOID DEPENDENCE (Lotsch et al., 2002 and Bart et
al., 2004), has been reclassified based on the findings of Hollt (2002)
and Arias et al. (2006).

The 118A-G SNP in the OPRM1 gene results in an asn40-to-asp (N40D)
substitution in the-N terminal region of the protein, and is predicted
to result in the loss of a putative N-glycosylation site (Bond et al.,
1998).

The overall frequency of the 118G allele is about 10.5%, but varies
significantly between different ethnic groups (African American, 0.016;
Caucasian, 0.115; Hispanic, 0.142) (Bond et al., 1998). The 118G allele
has a frequency varying from 0.078 to 0.341 in various populations
(LaForge et al., 2000). It is present in 49 to 60% of those of Asian
ancestry (Mague et al., 2009).

Bond et al. (1998) found that the asp40 variant receptor bound the
endogenous agonist beta-endorphin (see POMC, 176830) 3 times more
tightly than the wildtype receptor in Xenopus oocytes. No differences in
binding affinity were observed for other opioid alkaloids or peptides.
In contrast, Beyer et al. (2004) and Mague et al. (2009) found no
differences in binding affinities between the 2 SNP alleles for several
agonists, including morphine, beta-endorphin, naxolone, and
morphine-6-glucuronide in human embryonic kidney 293 cells and mouse
brain, respectively.

Zhang et al. (2005) observed that the OPRM1 118A mRNA allele was 1.5- to
2.5-fold more abundant than the 118G allele in heterozygous brain
autopsy tissues. Transfection and inhibition studies showed that only
118G, and not substitutions at position 118 with A, T, or C, resulted in
lower mRNA levels, in spite of equal stability. Moreover, 118G caused a
10-fold lower OPRM1 protein level as measured by Western blot and
receptor binding analyses. Zhang et al. (2005) concluded that 118G is a
functional variant that results in decreased levels of OPRM1 mRNA and
protein. These results were confirmed by Mague et al. (2009) in mice.

STUDIES OF PHENOTYPIC ASSOCIATIONS

The 118A-G SNP in OPRM1 has been widely studied for its association in a
variety of drug addiction and pain sensitivity phenotypes; however, the
results are conflicting and the mechanisms underlying these potential
associations remain elusive (Mague et al., 2009).

Although Bart et al. (2004) and Drakenberg et al. (2006) independently
reported an association between the 118G allele and opioid dependence
(610064), a metaanalysis of 22 published papers on the subject (Arias et
al., 2006) concluded that the N40D SNP does not affect the risk for
substance dependence. Hollt (2002) also noted that association studies
do not provide clear evidence that the 118A-G polymorphism is involved
in opioid or alcohol addiction.

In a study of 20 healthy individuals, comprising 10 118A/A homozygotes,
Lotsch et al. (2002) presented evidence that the 118G allele is
associated with decreased pupil constrictory effect of
morphine-6-glucuronide, the major metabolite of morphine. However, in
reviewing the findings of Lotsch et al. (2002), Hollt (2002) concluded
that differences in potencies most probably reflected a much lower
blood-brain barrier permeability of M6G compared to morphine, since the
receptor affinities of the 2 drugs are comparable (Wu et al., 1997).

In a study of 20 healthy individuals, comprising 10 118A/A homozygotes,
6 118G/G homozygotes, and 4 118A/G heterozygotes, Oertel et al. (2006)
found that carriers of the 118G allele showed decreased tolerance to
pain stimuli and decreased respiratory depression after alfentanil
administration compared to those without the 118G allele. When compared
to noncarriers, homozygous carriers needed 2 to 4 times higher
alfentanil concentrations to produce the same amount of analgesia, and
10 to 12 times higher concentrations to produce the same degree of
respiratory depression. Oertel et al. (2006) concluded that while both
homozygous and heterozygous carriers of the 118G allele may show
decreased opioid-induced analgesia, only homozygous carriers of 118G
show decreased opioid-induced respiratory depressive effects.

Mague et al. (2009) found that mice homozygous for the 118G allele
failed to exhibit morphine-induced hyperactivity, as seen in wildtype
mice. Homozygous G/G mice also showed a decrease in morphine-induced
antinociception compared to wildtype mice. Although G/G males were
similar to wildtype in preference to morphine-paired environments, G/G
females did not show a preference to morphine-paired environments.

609397	TITLE *609397 STORKHEAD BOX 1; STOX1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing genes within the critical region defined for a
preeclampsia locus on chromosome 10 (609404), van Dijk et al. (2005)
identified STOX1. RT-PCR detected 4 STOX1 splice variants in early
placenta, including invasive extravillous trophoblasts. The variants
encode 3 different proteins of 989 (isoform A), 227 (isoform B), and 169
(isoform C) amino acids. Isoform A has an 87-amino acid DNA-binding
winged helix domain, a nuclear localization signal, and a nuclear export
signal. The winged helix domain does not have the characteristic Y/F
sequence conserved in the related FOXO protein family. Isoform B lacks
the nuclear export signal, and isoform C lacks the nuclear export signal
and part of the winged helix domain. Immunolocalization of
fluorescence-tagged proteins localized isoform A to either the nucleus
or the cytoplasm of transfected immortalized normal diploid extravillous
trophoblasts, but no cells showed both nuclear and cytoplasmic
fluorescence. Isoform B localized to the nucleus, and isoform C to the
nucleolus.

GENE STRUCTURE

Van Dijk et al. (2005) determined that the STOX1 gene contains 5
alternatively spliced exons. Exons 1 and 2 are separated by an intron of
54 kb, and the start codon in exon 1 is contained within a CpG island of
about 1.5 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, van Dijk et al. (2005) mapped the STOX1
gene to chromosome 10q22.1 in a region that contains a cluster of DNA-
and RNA-binding proteins.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In preeclamptic sib pairs from 24 Dutch families, van Dijk et al. (2005)
identified 5 different missense mutations in the STOX1 gene, including
tyr153 to his (Y153H; 609397.0001) and glu608 to asp (E608D;
609397.0002); all 5 mutations were identical between affected sisters,
cosegregated with the preeclamptic phenotype, and followed matrilineal
inheritance. The Y153H mutation was the most common, occurring in 23 of
the 24 sib pairs; 6 sib pairs carried more than 1 mutation. Van Dijk et
al. (2005) concluded that STOX1 is a maternal-effect gene and that loss
of function of STOX1 in the placenta underlies preeclampsia (PEE4;
609404) in Dutch females.

Iglesias-Platas et al. (2007) concluded that their data did not support
the hypothesis that STOX1 has a role in maternal transmission of the
preeclampsia phenotype, either through an epigenetic mechanism or
through matrilineal transmission of polymorphic variants. In their
cohorts, the amino acid changes observed behaved as simple polymorphisms
rather than as mutations associated with a pathogenic condition. They
observed a high frequency of the CC genotype of the Y153H variation
(609397.0001) in uncomplicated pregnancies, demonstrating that this
allele cannot be considered a mutation predisposing to preeclampsia. In
the reply to Iglesias-Platas et al. (2007), van Dijk et al. (2007)
pointed out that preeclampsia occurs in at least 2 forms, placental and
maternal, which differ in etiology and in genetic risk and inheritance
(Oudejans et al., 2007). The placental form runs in families, with
recurrence across generations and occurrence within families. The
maternal form is likely to involve a maternal susceptibility gene with
low effect. By design, affected sib pair studies described by van Dijk
et al. (2005) target the familial form. The high incidence of
intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) confirms the early placental
origin of the familial form.

Kivinen et al. (2007) failed to find evidence in support of STOX1 as a
preeclampsia gene in a cohort of 245 Finnish women with preeclampsia
using genetic linkage analysis and haplotype analysis. They noted that
STOX1 expression studies with RNA from placentas of 8 preeclamptic and 6
uncomplicated deliveries failed to show a significant difference in
expression levels.

By using complementary in vitro and ex vivo approaches, van Dijk et al.
(2010) showed that the STOX1 risk allele Y153H 609397.0001 negatively
regulated trophoblast invasion by upregulation of the cell-cell adhesion
protein alpha-T-catenin (CTNNA3; 607667). This was effectuated at the
crucial epithelial-mesenchymal transition from proliferative into
invasive extravillous trophoblast. The STOX1-CTNNA3 interaction was
direct and included Akt (164730)-mediated phosphorylated control of
nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and ubiquitin-mediated degradation similar
to that of FOX multigene family members (see, e.g., FOXO3A, 602681). The
authors concluded that Y153H directly limits first-trimester
extravillous trophoblast invasion, the earliest hallmark of
preeclampsia.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
PREECLAMPSIA/ECLAMPSIA 4
STOX1, TYR153HIS

In 23 preeclamptic Dutch sib pairs (609404), van Dijk et al. (2005)
identified a tyr153-to-his (Y153H) substitution in exon 2 of the STOX1
gene. The substitution arose from a 458T-C transition. The authors
traced informative nucleotide variations across 3 generations in 6 of
the 23 families and found that the mutation on the maternal allele in
the second generation was transmitted to 13 children in the third
generation who were born from preeclamptic pregnancies, whereas the 2
children who were born of normal pregnancies did not carry the mutated
maternal allele.

Iglesias-Platas et al. (2007) observed a high frequency of the CC
genotype of the Y153H variation in uncomplicated pregnancies, which led
them to conclude that this allele cannot be considered a mutation
predisposing to preeclampsia.

.0002
PREECLAMPSIA/ECLAMPSIA 4
STOX1, GLU608ASP

In 2 preeclamptic Dutch sib pairs (609404), van Dijk et al. (2005)
identified a glu608-to-asp (E608D) substitution in exon 3 of the STOX1
gene. The mutation was also found in their mothers, who had a history of
pregnancy-induced hypertension (see 189800). One sib pair also carried
the Y153H mutation (609397.0001): 1 third-generation daughter carried
both mutations and was born of a preeclamptic pregnancy; the other
carried neither and was born of a normal pregnancy.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Calprotectin, the heterodimeric protein complex composed of S100A8
(123885) and S100A9, is a major calcium- and zinc-binding protein in the
cytosol of neutrophils, monocytes, and keratinocytes (Sampson et al.,
2002). Vogl et al. (2007) noted that complexes of S100A8 and S100A9 are
the physiologically relevant forms of these proteins.

CLONING

See 123885 for a description of calgranulin A (CAGA) and calgranulin B
(CAGB), which have molecular weights 11,000 and 14,000, respectively,
and together represent the cystic fibrosis antigen (CFAG). They are
coded by separate genes. Odink et al. (1987) identified and cloned the
calgranulin B gene, CAGB, also known as MRP14.

GENE FUNCTION

By study of DNA from a panel of somatic cell hybrids, van Heyningen et
al. (1989) and Dorin et al. (1990) showed that the CAGB gene
cosegregates with CAGA (S100A8; 123885) in somatic cell hybrids and that
both are closely situated to calcyclin (S100A6; 114110) and calcium
placental protein (S100A4; 114210).

Vogl et al. (2007) demonstrated that mice lacking Mrp8-Mrp14 complexes
are protected from endotoxin-induced lethal shock and Escherichia
coli-induced abdominal sepsis. Both proteins are released during
activation of phagocytes, and Mrp8-Mrp14 complexes amplify the
endotoxin-triggered inflammatory responses of phagocytes. Mrp8 is the
active component that induces intracellular translocation of myeloid
differentiation primary response protein-88 (MYD88; 602170) and
activation of interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-1 (IRAK1; 300283)
and nuclear factor-kappa-B (NFKB; see 164011), resulting in elevated
expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha; 191160). Using
phagocytes expressing a nonfunctional Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4;
603030), HEK293 cells transfected with TLR4, CD14 (158120), and MD2
(LY96; 605243), and by surface plasmon resonance studies in vitro, Vogl
et al. (2007) demonstrated that MRP8 specifically interacts with the
TLR4-MD2 complex, thus representing an endogenous ligand of TLR4. The
data demonstrated that MRP8 is the active component of the complex,
while MRP14 seems to regulate MRP8 function. Vogl et al. (2007)
concluded that MRP8-MRP14 complexes are novel inflammatory components
that amplify phagocyte activation during sepsis upstream of
TNF-alpha-dependent effects.

Corbin et al. (2008) found that neutrophil-derived calprotectin
inhibited growth of Staphylococcus aureus in abscesses through chelation
of Mn(2+) and Zn(2+), an activity that resulted in reprogramming of the
bacterial transcriptome. Abscesses of mice lacking calprotectin had
enhanced levels of metals and increased staphylococcal proliferation.
Corbin et al. (2008) concluded that calprotectin is a critical factor in
the innate immune response to infection and that metal chelation is a
mechanism for inhibiting microbial growth inside abscessed tissue.

Using a mouse model of autoimmunity, Loser et al. (2010) showed that
production of the damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) molecules
Mrp8 and Mrp14 was essential for induction of autoreactive Cd8 (see
186910)-positive T cells and development of systemic autoimmunity. FACS
analysis demonstrated that this effect of Mrp8 and Mrp14 was associated
with Tlr4 signaling and increased Il17 (603149) expression.
Immunohistochemical analysis revealed upregulated MRP8 and MRP14
expression in human cutaneous lupus erythematosus (see 152700) lesions,
and MRP8 and MRP14 were detectable in sera from individuals with active
disease. IL17 was upregulated in CD8-positive T cells from individuals
with lupus when stimulated with MRP8 and MRP14, suggesting that MRP8 and
MRP14 have a key role in the development of autoreactive lymphocytes
during autoimmune disease. Loser et al. (2010) concluded that there is a
link between the local expression of DAMP molecules and systemic
autoimmunity.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Psoriasis (see 177900) is an inflammatory skin disorder characterized by
keratinocyte hyperproliferation and altered differentiation. Linkage
analyses have identified at least 7 distinct disease susceptibility
regions. PSORS4 (603935) maps to chromosome 1q21, within the epidermal
differentiation complex (EDC; see 152445), a cluster that contains 13
genes encoding S100 calcium-binding proteins. Semprini et al. (2002)
analyzed S100 gene expression in psoriatic individuals from 2 large
pedigrees characterized by linkage studies, 1 linked and 1 unlinked to
the 1q21 locus. The analyses demonstrated that only the 1q21-linked
family had upregulation of S100A8, S100A9, and, to a lesser extent,
S100A7 (600353) and S100A12 (603112). Later studies confirmed
S100A8/S100A9-specific overexpression in 1q-linked pedigrees.

Calprotectin, the complex of S100A8 and S100A9, is the major calcium-
and zinc-binding protein of phagocytes. Sampson et al. (2002) reported 5
cases of hypercalprotectinemia (194470), a syndrome characterized by
hyperzincemia associated with excessively high plasma concentrations of
calprotectin. All patients presented with recurrent infections,
hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, and evidence of systemic inflammation; 2
patients were mother and son. Sampson et al. (2002) concluded that there
was probably no primary defect in S100A8 or S100A9, but that the
metabolism of calprotectin was defective.

Zenz et al. (2005) showed that inducible epidermal deletion of JunB
(165161) and its functional companion c-Jun (165160) in adult mice leads
within 2 weeks to a phenotype resembling the histologic and molecular
hallmarks of psoriasis, including arthritic lesions. In contrast to the
skin phenotype, the development of arthritic lesions required T and B
cells and signaling through tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 (TNFR1;
191190). Prior to the disease onset, the chemotactic proteins S100A8 and
S100A9, which map to the psoriasis susceptibility region PSORS4, were
strongly induced in mutant keratinocytes in vivo and in vitro. Zenz et
al. (2005) proposed that the abrogation of JunB/activator protein-1
(AP1) in keratinocytes triggers chemokine/cytokine expression, which
recruits neutrophils and macrophages to the epidermis, thereby
contributing to the phenotypic changes observed in psoriasis. Thus,
their data support the hypothesis that epidermal alterations are
sufficient to initiate both skin lesions and arthritis in psoriasis.

NOMENCLATURE

Schafer et al. (1995) isolated a YAC from 1q21 on which 9 different
genes coding for S100 calcium-binding proteins could be localized. The
clustered organization of S100 genes allowed introduction of a new
logical nomenclature based on their physical arrangement on the
chromosome with S100A1 (176940) being closest to the telomere and S100A9
being closest to the centromere. In the new nomenclature, CAGB became
S100A9.

610925	TITLE *610925 INTERLEUKIN 17 RECEPTOR C; IL17RC
;;INTERLEUKIN 17 RECEPTOR-LIKE PROTEIN; IL17RL
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

IL17RC is widely expressed in nonleukocyte tissues and forms a
heteromeric receptor for IL17 (603149) with IL17R (IL17RA; 605461)
(Haudenschild et al., 2002; Toy et al., 2006).

CLONING

By searching databases for sequences with homology to IL17R,
Haudenschild et al. (2002) identified IL17RC, which they termed IL17RL.
The predicted full-length 720-amino acid protein has an N-terminal
signal peptide, followed by an acidic extracellular domain with 9
potential N-glycosylation sites, a single-pass transmembrane domain, and
a basic cytoplasmic region with multiple phosphorylation sites. It has a
calculated molecular mass of 76.4 kD and shares 22% amino acid identity
with IL17R. By database analysis, Haudenschild et al. (2002) identified
numerous IL17RL splice variants with the potential to produce at least
12 protein isoforms, including both transmembrane receptors and soluble
decoy receptors. Northern blot analysis detected strongest expression in
prostate, kidney, liver, heart, and muscle, with barely detectable
levels in thymus and peripheral blood leukocytes. The major transcript
was 2.5 kb, and diffuse bands between 2.1 and 3.1 kb were also detected.
Quantitative RT-PCR analysis demonstrated frequent absence of exon 7,
possibly in a tissue-specific manner. Immunoblot analysis showed
multiple bands of 33 to 60 kD, suggesting the presence of numerous
IL17RL isoforms. Immunohistochemical analysis indicated expression in
skeletal muscle, prostate, kidney, and placenta. Prostate cancers showed
decreased reactivity in epithelial cells and increased reactivity in
stromal regions relative to normal prostate.

GENE FUNCTION

Using flow cytometric, ELISA, immunoprecipitation, and Western blot
analyses, Toy et al. (2006) showed that expression of both human IL17RA
and IL17RC on Il17ra-deficient mouse fibroblasts was necessary for
either human IL17 or IL17F (606496) to fully bind cells and induce
secretion of CXCL1 (155730). Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed a
physical association between IL17RA and IL17RC. Toy et al. (2006)
concluded that the functional IL17R is a heteromeric complex consisting
of at least IL17RA and IL17RC.

GENE STRUCTURE

Haudenschild et al. (2002) determined that the IL17RC gene contains 19
exons and spans 16.6 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Haudenschild et al. (2002) mapped the
IL17RC gene to chromosome 3p25.3-p24.1.

;;PRX2;;
PEROXIDE REDUCTASE, THIOREDOXIN-DEPENDENT; TDPX1; TPX1;;
NATURAL KILLER-ENHANCING FACTOR B; NKEFB
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Shau et al. (1994) identified a red blood cell factor, NKEF, that
enhances natural killer (NK) cell activity. By immunoscreening an
erythroleukemia cDNA library, they isolated cDNAs encoding NKEFA (PRDX1;
176763) and NKEFB. The NKEFA and NKEFB proteins contain 199 and 198
amino acids, respectively, and are 75% identical. The authors noted that
proteins related to NKEFA and NKEFB appear to be induced by oxidative
stress. Shau et al. (1994) concluded that in addition to
immunoregulation of NK activity, the NKEFs may be important for cells in
coping with oxidative insults.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and free radicals that are produced during
normal metabolism have the potential of damaging cellular
macromolecules. Defenses against such damage include a number of
antioxidant enzymes that specifically target the removal or dismutation
of the reactive agent. Pahl et al. (1995) isolated a human gene,
symbolized TDPX1 (for thioredoxin-dependent peroxide reductase-1), that
encodes an enzyme homologous to the yeast thioredoxin peroxidase (TPX).
The human coding sequence was determined from the product of a PCR
amplification of human cDNA using primers based on the rat sequence
(Chae et al., 1994). The 198-amino acid rat protein was, in turn,
isolated as a cDNA from a brain expression library with antibodies to
bovine thiol-specific antioxidant (TSA) enzyme. The rat and yeast TSA
proteins show significant similarity to Salmonella typhimurium alkyl
hydroperoxide reductase.

MAPPING

Based on PCR analysis of DNAs from a human/rodent somatic cell hybrid
panel, Pahl et al. (1995) assigned the TDPX1 locus to chromosome 13.
Further localization to 13q12 was achieved by fluorescence in situ
hybridization, using as a probe DNA from a YAC that contained the TDPX1
gene. However, Gross (2012) mapped the PRDX2 gene to chromosome 19p13.2
based on an alignment of the PRDX2 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC003022)
with the genomic sequence (GRCh37).

GENE FUNCTION

To clarify the physiologic relevance of peroxiredoxins, Lee et al.
(2003) generated a mouse model deficient in PRDX2, which is abundantly
expressed in all types of cells. The Prdx2 -/- mice were healthy in
appearance and fertile. However, they had splenomegaly caused by the
congestion of red pulp with hemosiderin accumulation. Heinz bodies were
detected in their peripheral blood, and morphologically abnormal cells
were increased in the dense red blood cell (RBC) fractions, which
contained markedly higher levels of ROS. The null mice had significantly
decreased hematocrit levels, but increased reticulocyte counts and
erythropoietin levels, indicative of a compensatory action to maintain
hematologic homeostasis. A labeling experiment in null mice showed that
a variety of RBC proteins were highly oxidized. The results suggested
that Prdx -/- mice have hemolytic anemia and that peroxiredoxin II plays
a major role in protecting RBCs from oxidative stress in mice.

Choi et al. (2005) demonstrated that PRDX2 is a negative regulator of
PDGF (see 190040) signaling. Prx II deficiency results in increased
production of peroxide, enhanced activation of PDGF receptor (PDGFR; see
173490) and phospholipase C-gamma-1 (172420), and subsequently increased
cell proliferation and migration in response to PDGF. These responses
are suppressed by expression of wildtype Prx II, but not an inactive
mutant. Notably, Prx II is recruited to PDGFR upon PDGF stimulation, and
suppresses protein tyrosine phosphatase inactivation. Prx II also leads
to the suppression of PDGFR activation in primary culture and in a
murine restenosis model, including PDGF-dependent neointimal thickening
of vascular smooth muscle cells. Choi et al. (2005) concluded that their
results demonstrate a localized role for endogenous peroxide in PDGF
signaling, and indicate a biologic function for Prx II in cardiovascular
disease.

By immunoblot, liquid chromatographic mass spectrometric,
immunoelectron, and confocal microscopic analyses, Koncarevic et al.
(2009) showed that human PRX2 was enriched in the malaria parasite,
Plasmodium falciparum. Importation of PRX2 into the parasite cytosol
compensated for the lack of catalase and glutathione peroxidase and
helped to maintain an adequate antioxidant defense. Pull-down
experiments demonstrated that PRX2 interacted with and was active with
parasite Trx1. PRX2 accounted for about half of the thioredoxin activity
in parasite extracts, and PRX2 expression was increased in the presence
of chloroquine, regardless of P. falciparum strain susceptibility to the
drug. Koncarevic et al. (2009) concluded that P. falciparum has adapted
to adopt PRX2, using the host protein for its own purposes.

O'Neill and Reddy (2011) studied circadian clocks in human red blood
cells in order to avoid the transcription-translation feedloop that is
presumed to be essential for clock formation. Human red blood cells have
no nucleus and therefore cannot perform transcription. O'Neill and Reddy
(2011) found that transcription is not required for circadian
oscillations in humans, and that nontranscriptional events seem to be
sufficient to sustain cellular circadian rhythms. Using red blood cells,
they found that peroxiredoxins, highly conserved antioxidant proteins,
undergo approximately 24-hour redox cycles, which persist for many days
under constant conditions (i.e., in the absence of external cues).
Moreover, these rhythms are entrainable (i.e., tunable by environmental
stimuli) and temperature-compensated, both key features of circadian
rhythms. O'Neill and Reddy (2011) anticipated that their findings would
facilitate more sophisticated cellular clock models, highlighting the
interdependency of transcriptional and nontranscriptional oscillations
in potentially all eukaryotic cells.

O'Neill et al. (2011) showed that nontranscriptional mechanisms are
sufficient to sustain circadian timekeeping in the eukaryotic lineage,
although they normally function in conjunction with transcriptional
components. They identified oxidation of peroxiredoxin proteins as a
transcription-independent rhythmic biomarker, which is also rhythmic in
mammals. Moreover, O'Neill et al. (2011) showed that pharmacologic
modulators of the mammalian clock mechanism have the same effects on
rhythms in Ostreococcus tauri, a unicellular pico-eukaryotic alga that
possesses a naturally minimized clock. Posttranslational mechanisms, and
at least 1 rhythmic marker, seem to be better conserved than
transcriptional clock regulators. O'Neill et al. (2011) postulated that
it is plausible that the oldest oscillator components are
nontranscriptional in nature, as in cyanobacteria, and are conserved
across kingdoms.

188855	TITLE *188855 GRANULYSIN; GNLY
;;T-LYMPHOCYTE ACTIVATION GENE 519; TLA519;;
D2S69E;;
NKG5
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The GNLY gene encodes granulysin, a member of the saposin-like protein
(SAPLIP) family that is present in cytotoxic granules of cytolytic T
cells (CTSs) and natural killer (NK) cells and is released from the
granules upon antigen stimulation (Jongstra et al., 1987; Pena et al.,
1997).

CLONING

Jongstra et al. (1987) isolated 2 overlapping clones corresponding to
the GNLY gene, which they termed '519,' from a human functional
cytolytic T cell cDNA library. The deduced 129-residue protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 14.6 kD. Northern blot analysis detected a
900-bp mRNA that was also detected in functional T-helper cell lines,
but not in several T-cell tumor lines or other tissues. The findings
indicated that 519 expression is restricted to IL2 (147680)-dependent,
antigen-driven functional T cells. Expression of 519 was induced at
least 10-fold in peripheral blood lymphocytes by antigenic or mitogenic
stimulation.

Yabe et al. (1990) cloned GNLY, which they termed NKG5, from a natural
killer cell cDNA library. The deduced 145-residue protein began at a
start codon at position 129, with significant homology with the 519 gene
reported by Jongstra et al. (1987). A sequence comparison showed that
the 519 and NKG5 sequences were identical except that NKG5 lacks a
242-bp segment that is found in 519, and that this deletion leads to the
use of a different putative translational start codon and different
N-terminal regions. Unlike 519, the predicted NKG5 protein has a
putative N-terminal signal peptide, suggesting that it is a secreted
protein. In contrast, the 519 protein is hydrophilic and proposed to act
intracellularly. Northern blot analysis detected 40-fold higher
expression of the NKG5 transcript compared to 519 in NK and T cells.
Southern blot analysis indicated that both mRNAs are transcripts from a
single gene, consistent with alternative splicing. Yabe et al. (1990)
concluded that the 519 transcript results from a nonproductive splicing
event and does not encode a functional protein.

Houchins et al. (1993) identified many potential regulatory segments
within the 5-prime flanking region of the NKG5 gene, including AP1, AP2,
AP3, and SRE motifs.

GENE STRUCTURE

Jongstra et al. (1987) identified 2 ATG translation initiation codons in
the 519 gene at positions 27 and 281: the latter at 281 was presumed to
be active, since the first ATG codon is followed by an in-frame stop
codon at position 69.

Houchins et al. (1993) determined that the GNLY gene contains 5 exons.

MAPPING

By in situ hybridization, Donlon et al. (1990) assigned the GNLY gene to
chromosome 2p12-q11.

GENE FUNCTION

Stenger et al. (1998) showed that granulysin is a critical effector
molecule of the antimicrobial activity of CTLs. Cytolytic T cells are
required for protective immunity against intracelluar pathogens such as
Listeria monocytogenes and Trypanosoma cruzi, which escape from
phagocytic vacuoles into the cytoplasm of infected host cells, as well
as Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, and Mycobacterium
tuberculosis, which are phagocytized by macrophages and remain localized
within phagosomes (Pena et al., 1997). An explanation for the functional
role of CTLs in immunity against intracellular infection was provided by
analysis of CTLs in tuberculosis (Kaufmann, 1988; Stenger et al., 1997).
These experiments suggested that CTLs that kill infected cells through
the granule-exocytosis pathway may release 1 or more effector molecules
with the capacity to kill the intracellular microbial pathogen directly.

Two subsets of CTLs exist, which differ in phenotype, cytotoxic effector
pathway, and antimicrobial activity. CD8+ CTLs lyse M.
tuberculosis-infected macrophages by a granule-dependent mechanism that
results in killing of the intracellular pathogen. In contrast, the
cytotoxicity of double negative CD4-/CD8- T cells is mediated by Fas-Fas
ligand interaction and does not inhibit growth of the mycobacteria. By
protein immunoblot analysis, Stenger et al. (1998) demonstrated the
presence of granulysin in CD8+ CTLs and the lack of granulysin
expression in CD4-/CD8- CTLs. Confocal microscopy of
granulysin-expressing cells showed a punctate pattern consistent with
granule localization. Furthermore, double staining of CD8+ T cells with
antibodies against granulysin and perforin (PRF1; 170280), a molecule
known to be expressed in cytotoxic granules, showed substantial
colocalization. Stenger et al. (1998) used recombinant granulysin to
test directly its antimicrobial activity against M. tuberculosis and
other organisms.

Chung et al. (2008) showed that blister cells from skin lesions from
patients with Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) or toxic epidermolysis
necrosis (TEN) (see 608579) primarily consisted of cytotoxic T
lymphocytes and natural killer cells, and that both blister fluids and
cells were cytotoxic. Gene expression profiling identified granulysin as
the most highly expressed cytotoxic molecule, confirmed by quantitative
PCR and immunohistochemistry. Depletion of granulysin reduced
cytotoxicity. In blister fluids, granulysin was in a 15-kD secretory
form, and injection of this form into mouse skin resulted in features
mimicking the skin necrosis. Chung et al. (2008) concluded that
secretory granulysin is a key molecule responsible for the disseminated
keratinocyte death in SJS/TEN. The findings also implicated a CTL- or NK
cell-mediated cytotoxicity that does not require direct cellular
contact.

605523	TITLE *605523 TRANSDUCER OF ERBB2, 1; TOB1
;;TOB
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Matsuda et al. (1996) cloned a cDNA encoding TOB1, which they called
TOB, a protein that interacts with the ERBB2 (164870) gene product p185.
Sequence analysis revealed that TOB1 is a 45-kD, 345-amino acid protein
whose N-terminal half is homologous to the antiproliferative gene
product BTG1 (109580). The C-terminal half of TOB1 is characterized by
the presence of a proline- and glutamine-rich sequence. Expression of
TOB1 mRNA was observed in various cell types.

GENE FUNCTION

Matsuda et al. (1996) found that, like BTG1, exogenously expressed TOB1
was able to suppress growth of NIH 3T3 cells, but the growth suppression
was hampered by the presence of kinase-active p185. By using GST-TOB1
proteins containing either full-length TOB1 or the N-terminal half of
TOB1, Matsuda et al. (1996) showed that the C-terminal half of TOB1 was
relevant to its interaction with p185. Furthermore, TOB1 could be
coimmunoprecipitated with anti-ERBB2 antibody, and reciprocally, p185
could be coimmunoprecipitated with anti-TOB1 antibodies. These data
suggested that p185 negatively regulates the TOB1-mediated
antiproliferative pathway through its interaction with TOB1, resulting
possibly in growth stimulation by p185. Expression of TOB1 mRNA was not
correlated with expression of ERBB2, suggesting that other receptor-type
protein-tyrosine kinases are also involved in the TOB1-mediated
regulation of cell growth.

Tzachanis et al. (2001) used antigen-specific T-cell clones rendered
anergic by stimulation of T-cell receptor (see 186810) in the absence of
costimulation or interleukin-2 (IL2; 147680) and suppression subtractive
hybridization and differential screening to identify genes selectively
expressed in anergic cells. TOB was constitutively expressed in primary
peripheral blood T lymphocytes and had to be downregulated for T-cell
activation. Immunoprecipitation, immunoblot, and gel-shift analyses
showed that TOB interacts with SMAD4 (MADH4; 600093) and, to a lesser
degree, with SMAD2 (601366) and augments SMAD DNA binding to sites in
the IL2 promoter, leading to an inhibition of IL2 transcription.
Tzachanis et al. (2001) concluded that T-cell quiescence is an actively
maintained phenotype that must be suppressed to allow T-cell activation
to occur, suggesting targets for the manipulation of the immune
response.

Xiong et al. (2006) found that zebrafish Tob1a was required for correct
dorsoventral patterning. Tob1a inhibited beta-catenin (CTNNB1; 116806)
transcriptional activity by physically associating with beta-catenin and
preventing formation of beta-catenin/Lef1 (153245) complexes. Although
Tob1a also inhibited the transcriptional activity of Smad3 (603109), its
role in limiting dorsal development was executed primarily by
antagonizing the beta-catenin signal. By immunoprecipitation analysis,
Xiong et al. (2006) showed that endogenous TOB1 and beta-catenin
interacted in human HEK293T cells. SMAD3 also immunoprecipitated with
TOB1 in human cells.

MAPPING

By FISH, Matsuda et al. (1996) mapped the TOB1 gene to 17q21.

ANIMAL MODEL

Yoshida et al. (2000) showed that murine Tob is a negative regulator of
bone morphogenetic protein (BMP; see 112265)/SMAD signaling in
osteoblasts. Mice carrying a targeted deletion of the Tob gene had a
greater bone mass due to increased numbers of osteoblasts. Orthotopic
bone formation in response to Bmp2 (112261) was elevated in
Tob-deficient mice. Overproduction of Tob repressed Bmp2-induced,
Smad-mediated transcriptional activation. Tob associated with
receptor-regulated Smads, including Smad1 (601595), Smad5 (603110), and
Smad8 (603295), and colocalized with these SMADs in the nuclear bodies
upon BMP2 stimulation. The results indicated that Tob negatively
regulates osteoblast proliferation and differentiation by suppressing
the activity of the receptor-regulated Smad proteins.

603761	TITLE *603761 RAD9, S. POMBE, HOMOLOG OF, A; RAD9A
;;RAD9, S. POMBE, HOMOLOG OF; RAD9
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

In S. pombe, rad9 is one of 6 genes essential for both the incomplete
DNA replication (S-M) and DNA damage checkpoints. See HUS1 (603760). By
searching an EST database, Lieberman et al. (1996) identified a partial
cDNA encoding HRAD9, a human rad9 homolog. The authors used the partial
cDNA to recover additional human RAD9 cDNAs corresponding to the entire
coding region. The predicted 391-amino acid human protein is 25%
identical to S. pombe rad9.

GENE FUNCTION

Lieberman et al. (1996) found that the human RAD9 gene partially
complemented the hydroxyurea sensitivity, radiosensitivity, and
checkpoint defects of rad9-null mutant cells.

On immunoblots of mammalian cell extracts, Volkmer and Karnitz (1999)
found that human RAD9 migrated at 70 kD, even though it has a predicted
molecular mass of 45 kD. The authors attributed this discrepancy to
complex posttranslational modifications. In vivo, the human RAD9 protein
was phosphorylated in response to DNA damage, suggesting that it
participates in a DNA damage-inducible signaling pathway.
Immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that the fully modified form of
RAD9 interacts selectively with RAD1 (603153) and HUS1 in a stable
complex. Volkmer and Karnitz (1999) concluded that these 3 proteins are
central components of a DNA damage-responsive protein complex in human
cells.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization and by analysis of somatic cell
hybrids, Lieberman et al. (1996) mapped the RAD9 gene to 11q13.1-q13.2.
They found that the 3-prime end of the RAD9 cDNA contains sequences from
the 3-prime untranslated region of PPP1CA (176875), indicating that the
2 genes are transcribed in opposite orientations.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Maniwa et al. (2005) found that a functional human RAD9 protein
accumulated in the nuclei of nonsmall cell lung carcinoma (211980)
cells. Maniwa et al. (2006) examined the RAD9 sequence in tumor and
peripheral normal lung tissues, and the expression of its mRNA using
RT-PCR. No sequence alterations were detected in the RAD9 gene, which
was found to be normally transcribed in surgically resected lung
carcinoma cells. However, in 8 (16%) cases a SNP was observed at the
second position of codon 239 (his/arg heterozygous variant) of the gene.
This frequency was significantly higher than that found in the normal
population.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Fernandez-Salguero et al. (1995) cloned 3 complete CYP2A genes, CYP2A6
(122720), CYP2A7, and CYP2A13 (608055), in addition to 2 pseudogenes
truncated after exon 5, all of which are located in a 350-kb region on
chromosome 19q13.2. The deduced CYP2A7 protein contains 494 amino acids.

GENE STRUCTURE

Fernandez-Salguero et al. (1995) determined that the CYP2A7 gene
contains 9 exons.

of the CYP2 gene cluster, which spans 350 kb on chromosome 19q13.2. They
also determined the directions of transcription.

;;SMALL INDUCIBLE CYTOKINE A7; SCYA7;;
MONOCYTE CHEMOTACTIC PROTEIN 3; MCP3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Chemokines are generally subdivided into C-C chemokines, which have 2
adjacent cysteines, and C-X-C chemokines, in which the cysteines are
separated by 1 amino acid. Members of the former subfamily predominantly
attract monocytes/macrophages, whereas the latter family consists of
neutrophil chemotactic proteins. CCL7, also known as MCP3, belongs to
the C-C chemokine family. Other members of the C-C chemokine family
include MCP1 (CCL2; 158105), SCYA5 (CCL5; 187011), MIP1A (CCL3; 182283),
SCYA1 (CCL1; 182281), and SCYA4 (CCL4; 182284), all of which are located
with CCL7 in a gene cluster on chromosome 17q.

CLONING

Monocyte chemotactic proteins (MCPs) are chemokines involved in
macrophage recruitment during inflammation and cancer invasion
(Mantovani et al., 1992). These factors are often produced by invasive
cancer cells. Recruitment of leukocytes to the invasion front and
stimulation of the secretion of invasion-promoting proteolytic enzymes
from the attracted leukocytes may contribute to invasion and metastasis
of tumor cells (Opdenakker and Van Damme, 1992). Opdenakker et al.
(1994) used a full-length cDNA for MCP3, also known as SCYA7, to isolate
the functional human MCP3 gene. Opdenakker et al. (1994) determined the
sequence of the MCP3 gene.

GENE FUNCTION

Tissue degradation by the matrix metalloproteinase gelatinase A (120360)
is pivotal to inflammation and metastasis. Recognizing the catalytic
importance of substrate-binding exosites outside the catalytic domain,
McQuibban et al. (2000) screened for extracellular substrates using the
gelatinase A hemopexin domain as bait in the yeast 2-hybrid system. MCP3
was identified as a physiologic substrate of gelatinase A. Cleaved MCP3
binds to CC-chemokine receptors-1 (601159), -2 (601267), and -3
(601268), but no longer induces calcium fluxes or promotes chemotaxis,
and instead acts as a general chemokine antagonist that dampens
inflammation. McQuibban et al. (2000) suggested that matrix
metalloproteinases are both effectors and regulators of the inflammatory
response.

Using dermal fibroblasts from patients with systemic sclerosis (181750)
and controls and from type-1 tight-skin (Tsk1) mice, Ong et al. (2003)
demonstrated overexpression of MCP3 in early-stage systemic sclerosis
and neonatal Tsk1 skin. Pro-alpha-2(I) collagen (COL1A2; 120160)
promoter-reporter gene constructs were activated by MCP3 in transgenic
mice and in transient transfection assays; the effects of MCP3 could be
diminished by a neutralizing antibody to transforming growth factor-beta
(TGFB1; 190180). Ong et al. (2003) concluded that MCP3 may operate as a
profibrotic mediator with the potential to activate gene expression in
the extracellular matrix, at least in part via induction of TGFB1, in
addition to promoting an inflammatory cellular response.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Opdenakker et al. (1994) mapped
the MCP3 gene to chromosome 17q11.2-q12.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Modi et al. (2003) genotyped 9 SNPs spanning the CCL2-CCL7-CCL11
(601156) gene cluster on chromosome 17q in more than 3,000 DNA samples
from 5 AIDS cohorts (see 609423). Extensive linkage disequilibrium was
observed, particularly for 3 SNPs, -2136T in the CCL2 promoter
(158105.0001), 767G in intron 1 of the CCL2 gene (158105.0002), and
-1385A in the CCL11 promoter (601156.0001), that formed a 31-kb
haplotype (H7) containing the 3 genes. The frequencies of these 3 SNPs
and the H7 haplotype were significantly elevated in uninfected
individuals repeatedly exposed to HIV-1 through high-risk sexual
behavior or contaminated blood products. Since these chemokines do not
bind the primary HIV-1 coreceptors CCR5 (601373) or CXCR4 (162643), Modi
et al. (2003) proposed that the influence of the H7 haplotype on HIV-1
transmission may result from activation of the immune system rather than
receptor blockage.

120252	TITLE *120252 COLLAGEN, TYPE VIII, ALPHA-2; COL8A2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Type VIII collagen molecules, expressed by corneal and vascular
endothelial cells, are heterotrimers composed of 2 genetically distinct
polypeptides, alpha-1(VIII) (COL8A1; 120251) and alpha-2(VIII) (COL8A2;
120252), in the ratio of 2:1. Collagen VIII is a member of the 'short
chain collagen' subfamily. It is a major component of the hexagonal
lattice in the Descemet membrane (Muragaki et al., 1991).

CLONING

Muragaki et al. (1991) characterized the COL8A2 gene, which encodes a
deduced 644-amino acid protein with 3 domains. The N-terminal region
consists of 20 residues of non-triple-helical sequence (NC2), followed
by a triple-helical sequence of 457 residues. The triple-helical domain
(COL1) is contiguous with a 167-residue non-triple helical domain (NC1)
on the carboxyl side.

GENE STRUCTURE

The triple-helical and carboxyl non-triple-helical domains of COL8A1 are
encoded by a single, large exon in both mice and humans (Muragaki et
al., 1991).

MAPPING

By in situ hybridization, Muragaki et al. (1991) demonstrated that the
COL8A2 gene is located in the region 1p34.3-p32.3.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

The corneal endothelial dystrophies arise from dysfunction of the
corneal epithelium, leading to corneal opacification. This group of
conditions includes Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD; see
136800), posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy (PPCD; see 122000);
and the congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophies (see 121700).
Biswas et al. (2001) conducted a genomewide search of a 3-generation
family with early-onset FECD and identified a critical region of 6 to 7
cM at chromosome 1p34.3-p32, which includes the COL8A2 gene. Analysis of
its coding sequence defined a gln455-to-lys missense mutation
(120252.0001) within the triple helical domain of the protein in this
family. Mutation analysis in other patients demonstrated further
missense substitutions in familial and sporadic cases of FECD, as well
as in a single family with PPCD2 (609140). The authors suggested that
the underlying pathogenesis of FECD and PPCD2 may be related to
disturbance of the role of type VIII collagen in influencing the
terminal differentiation of the neural crest-derived corneal endothelial
cell.

In affected members of the autosomal dominant kindred with early-onset
Fuchs corneal dystrophy reported by Magovern et al. (1979), Gottsch et
al. (2005) identified heterozygosity for a novel point mutation in the
COL8A2 gene that resulted in a leu450-to-trp amino acid substitution
(120252.0003).

In a 3-generation family with late-onset FECD (610158), Biswas et al.
(2001) identified heterozygosity for a G-to-A transition that resulted
in an arg155-to-gln (R155Q) mutation. However, among 15 unrelated
Japanese patients with late-onset FECD, Kobayashi et al. (2004) found
heterozygosity for the R155Q mutation not only in 3 patients but also in
5 of 72 chromosomes (6.9%) from normal subjects. Moreover, investigation
of family members of a proband with the R155Q mutation revealed that the
87-year-old mother carried the R155Q mutation in homozygosity (and
another mutation in heterozygosity) but showed no corneal guttae or
endothelial cell decrease. Kobayashi et al. (2004) concluded that the
R155Q mutation in the COL8A2 gene may not be causative for the disorder.

In all 13 affected individuals tested within a 3-generation family with

heterozygosity for a C-to-A transversion at position 1364 that resulted
in a gln455-to-lys (Q455K) mutation; the codon change was CAG to AAG.
The identical mutation was found in 2 individuals from another family
with ultrastructural changes consistent with posterior polymorphous
corneal dystrophy (PPCD2; 609140).

DESCRIPTION 
MAPPING

Kwiatkowski et al. (1991) identified highly informative dinucleotide
repeat polymorphisms in the TCTE1 locus, previously called D6S46.
Linkage mapping positioned this marker midway between the centromere and
HLA with recombination fractions as follows:
D6Z1--0.21--TCTE1--0.24--HLA. Two-color fluorescence in situ
hybridization placed TCTE1 proximal to D6S19, which in turn is proximal
to D6S29 and HLA.

;;C/EBP-EPSILON;;
CRP1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Basic leucine zipper DNA-binding domains and leucine repeat regions
necessary for dimerization are characteristic of the bZIP class of
transcription factors. A subclass of these is the CCAAT/enhancer binding
protein (C/EBP) family, whose members have conserved carboxyl regions
containing the bZIP domain but differ at their amino termini where the
transactivating domain is generally present (Antonson et al., 1996).
These proteins are thought to act as homo- or heterodimers with other
members of the family. Antonson et al. (1996) isolated the human
C/EBP-epsilon gene by low-stringency screening with probes from the
C/EBP-alpha (116897) and delta (116898) sequences. The gene encodes a
281-amino acid protein with 92% identity to the rat CRP1 sequence.
Expression studies using RT-PCR detected transcription of CEBPE in the
Jurkat T-cell and HL60 promyelocytic cell lines. Northern blots showed
highest expression of 1.4- and 2.0-kb transcripts in peripheral blood
mononuclear cells and in ovary.

GENE STRUCTURE

Antonson et al. (1996) determined that the CEBPE gene contains 2 exons.

GENE FUNCTION

In humans, 4 C/EBP-epsilon isoforms, referred to as p32, p30, p27, and
p14, are generated (Chumakov et al., 1997; Yamanaka et al., 1997). The
p32, p27, and p14 forms are encoded by 4 mRNA isoforms generated by
transcription from 2 different promoters, P-alpha and P-beta, combined
with differential splicing. A p30 isoform is synthesized by translation
from a downstream start codon at amino acid position 32 (Yamanaka et
al., 1997).

MAPPING

Using interspecific backcross analysis, Jenkins et al. (1995) mapped the
Cebpe gene to mouse chromosome 14. Although the gene had not been mapped
in humans at that time, they stated that the tight linkage between Cebpe
and Ctla1 in the mouse suggests that the human homolog, CEBPE, is
located on human 14q; CTLA1 (123910) maps to human 14q11.2. Antonson et
al. (1996) mapped CEBPE by fluorescence in situ hybridization to
14q11.2, telomeric to T-cell receptor alpha (see 186880). A dinucleotide
repeat 34 nucleotides 3-prime of the polyadenylation signal was shown to
be identical to the marker D14S990 (Dib et al., 1996).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Specific granule deficiency (SGD; 245480) is a rare congenital disorder.
Because individuals with SGD express normal levels of lactoferrin and
transcobalamin in their saliva but not in either their plasma or
neutrophils, the molecular basis of SGD was hypothesized to involve
mutation of a myeloid-specific transcription factor. The CEBPE gene
encodes such a transcription factor, which is expressed primarily during
granulocytic differentiation. Targeted disruption of the gene in mice
leads to defects in terminal differentiation of neutrophils with
increased numbers of morphologically atypical neutrophils, with
functional defects closely paralleling those of SGD (Yamanaka et al.,
1997). Lekstrom-Himes et al. (1999) identified a homozygous 5-bp
deletion in the second exon of the CEBPE gene in a patient with SGD
(600749.0001). Gombart et al. (2001) identified a 1-bp insertion in the
coding region of the CEBPE gene in a second patient with SGD
(600749.0002).

ANIMAL MODEL

Among the relatively few transcription factors known to be involved in
myelopoiesis are several members of the CCAAT/enhancer binding protein
family. Members of this family include both transcriptional activators
and repressors. Targeted disruption of the murine Cebpa gene causes
multiple abnormalities, including impaired glycogenesis, lung
abnormalities, and impaired neutrophil development due to the absence of
granulocyte colony-stimulating factor signaling. Targeted inactivation
of the mouse Cebpb gene (189965) results in macrophage dysfunction,
impaired tumor killing, and lymphoproliferative disorders (Tanaka et
al., 1995; Screpanti et al., 1995). Yamanaka et al. (1997) found that
mice with a 'knockout' of the Cebpe gene developed normally and were
fertile but failed to generate functional neutrophils and eosinophils.
Opportunistic infections and tissue destruction led to death by 3 to 5
months of age. Furthermore, end-stage mice developed myelodysplasia,
characterized by proliferation of atypical granulocytes that effaced the
bone marrow and resulted in severe tissue destruction. Thus,
Cebp-epsilon is essential for terminal differentiation and functional
maturation of committed granulocyte progenitor cells.

To identify myelomonocytic target genes regulated by Cebpe, Kubota et
al. (2000) performed a representational difference analysis using
peritoneal lavage cells from wildtype and Cebpe knockout mice. Several
genes were more abundant in the wildtype cells. In addition to novel
genes, the more abundant of the known genes were Eta1 (166490),
cathepsin L (116880), galactose/N-acetyl galactosamine-specific lectin,
and the 3 chemokines Ccl7 (158106), Mip1-gamma, and C10 chemokine.
Kubota et al. (2000) concluded that Cebpe expression enhances chemokine
expression in mice.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
SPECIFIC GRANULE DEFICIENCY
CEBPE, 5-BP DEL, NT224

Lekstrom-Himes et al. (1999) identified homozygosity for a 5-bp deletion
in the second exon of the CEBPE gene in a patient with specific granule
deficiency (245480). The predicted 5-bp frameshift resulted in
truncation of the transcriptionally active p32 and p30 isoforms with the
loss of the dimerization and DNA-binding domain regions. The p27 and p14
isoforms, which are unable to activate transcription, were unaffected.
The truncated protein was unable to activate transcription efficiently.
The parents were first cousins once removed.

.0002
SPECIFIC GRANULE DEFICIENCY
CEBPE, 1-BP INS, 1113A

In a patient with specific granule deficiency (245480), Gombart et al.
(2001) found insertion of a single A at nucleotide 1113, at the 3-prime
end of exon 2. The mutation predicted a frameshift and premature
termination of the encoded C/EBP-epsilon isoforms p32, p30, p27, and
p14. The premature termination would result in a loss of the basic
region and leucine zipper domains that are critical for DNA binding and
dimerization, respectively. Both parents were heterozygous for the
mutation which was homozygous in the patient.

606585	TITLE *606585 ENAMELIN; ENAM
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Dental enamel is a highly mineralized tissue with 85% of its volume
occupied by unusually large, highly organized, hydroxyapatite crystals.
This highly organized and unusual structure is thought to be rigorously
controlled in ameloblasts through the interaction of a number of organic
matrix molecules that include enamelin, amelogenin (AMELX; 300391),
ameloblastin (AMBN; 601259), tuftelin (TUFT1; 600087), dentin
sialophosphoprotein (DSPP; 125485), and a variety of enzymes. Enamelin
is the largest protein in the enamel matrix of developing teeth and
comprises approximately 5% of total enamel matrix protein (summary by Hu
et al., 2000; Rajpar et al., 2001).

CLONING

Hu et al. (1997) cloned and characterized mRNAs for porcine enamelin. In
porcine enamel, enamelin is secreted as a 186-kD precursor protein,
which undergoes a series of proteolytic cleavages to generate several
polypeptides that reside in various layers of the enamel matrix. The
enamelin protein has a 39-amino acid signal peptide and the secretory
protein has 1,103 amino acids.

Dong et al. (2000) and Hu et al. (2000) independently cloned the human
gene for enamelin. Hu et al. (2000) found that enamelin is expressed by
ameloblasts in day 1 mouse developing incisors.

MAPPING

Dong et al. (2000) and Hu et al. (2000) independently mapped the
enamelin gene to chromosome 4q21.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Amelogenesis imperfecta (AI) is an inherited defect of dental enamel
formation that shows both clinical and genetic heterogeneity. Karrman et
al. (1997) mapped a locus for autosomal dominant hypoplastic
amelogenesis imperfecta (AI1B; 104500) to a 4-Mb YAC contig on
chromosome 4q11-q21. Rajpar et al. (2001) analyzed a 3-generation family
with an autosomal dominant smooth hypoplastic form of AI. A mutation
(606585.0001) in the splice donor site of intron 7 of enamelin was found
in affected members of this family.

In affected members of 7 families from northern Sweden with local
hypoplastic AI, Mardh et al. (2002) identified a heterozygous nonsense
mutation (606685.0002) in the ENAM gene, a phenotype that accounts for
27% of the autosomally inherited cases in northern Sweden.

In 3 unrelated patients with severe autosomal recessive local
hypoplastic amelogenesis imperfecta and class II anterior openbite
malocclusion (204650), Hart et al. (2003) identified homozygosity for a
nonsense mutation (606585.0003) in the ENAM gene. Heterozygous family
members showed localized pitting enamel defects.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) mutagenesis, Masuya et al. (2005)
generated mice with AI-like phenotypes in the incisors and molars of the
affected animals. Linkage analysis mapped mutations to a region of
chromosome 5 that contained the Enam gene, and sequence analysis
revealed 3 separate point mutations.

Hu et al. (2008) generated and characterized an Enam knockout/NLS
beta-gal knockin mouse. Enam +/- mice showed nearly normal enamel in the
maxillary incisors, but the mandibular incisors were discolored and
tended to wear rapidly where they contacted the maxillary incisors. Enam
-/- mice showed no true enamel. Radiography, microcomputed tomography,
and light and scanning microscopy were used to document changes in the
enamel of Enam -/- mice but did not discern any perturbations of bone,
dentin, or any other tissue besides the enamel layer. Although a thick
layer of enamel proteins covered normal-appearing dentin of unerupted
teeth, von Kossa staining revealed almost a complete absence of mineral
formation in this protein layer. However, a thin, highly irregular,
mineralized crust covered the dentin on erupted teeth, apparently
arising from the formation and fusion of small mineralization foci in
the deeper part of the accumulated enamel protein layer. The results
demonstrated ameloblast-specific expression of enamelin and revealed
that enamelin is essential for proper enamel matrix organization and
mineralization.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
AMELOGENESIS IMPERFECTA, TYPE IB
ENAM, IVS7, G-A, +1

In a 3-generation family with autosomal dominant hypoplastic local
amelogenesis imperfecta (AI1B; 104500), Rajpar et al. (2001) identified
a G-to-A transition in the splice donor site following exon 7 of the
ENAM gene. The mutation disrupted a HphI site, which permitted
confirmation of cosegregation with the disease phenotype within the
family. The mutation was predicted to exclude exon 7 from the mature
mRNA of enamelin, but since expression is limited to ameloblasts,
confirmation of the effect on splicing using RT-PCR was not possible.

.0002
AMELOGENESIS IMPERFECTA, TYPE IB
ENAM, LYS53TER

In affected members of 6 families from northern Sweden with type IB AI
(104500), Mardh et al. (2002) identified a heterozygous 438A-T
transversion in exon 4 of the ENAM gene, resulting in a lys53-to-ter
(K53X) substitution. This nonsense mutation was predicted to result in a
truncated peptide of 52 amino acids, as compared with 1142 amino acids
of the full-length protein. Mardh et al. (2002) screened 6 additional
small families with local hypoplastic AI and identified the same
mutation in affected members of 1 family.

.0003
AMELOGENESIS IMPERFECTA, TYPE IC
ENAM, 2-BP INS, 13185AG

In 3 unrelated Turkish patients with severe autosomal recessive local
hypoplastic amelogenesis imperfecta and openbite malocclusion (204650),
Hart et al. (2003) identified a homozygous 2-bp insertion (13185insAG)
in exon 10 of the ENAM gene, resulting in a premature stop codon. The
predicted truncated protein is 695 amino acids shorter than the wildtype
protein of 1,142 amino acids. All 6 parents and other family members who
were heterozygous for the mutation had localized hypoplastic enamel
pitting defects without malocclusion, which the authors did not consider
to be a mild form of amelogenesis imperfecta. Hart et al. (2003)
concluded that the 2-bp insertion mutation manifested a dose-dependent
effect.

303100	TITLE #303100 CHOROIDEREMIA; CHM
;;TAPETOCHOROIDAL DYSTROPHY, PROGRESSIVE; TCD
CHOROIDAL SCLEROSIS, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION A number sign (#) is used with this entry because choroideremia is
caused by mutation in the CHM gene (300390), which encodes Rab escort
protein-1 (REP1).

DESCRIPTION

Choroideremia is an X-linked disease that leads to the degeneration of
the choriocapillaris, the retinal pigment epithelium, and the
photoreceptor of the eye (Cremers et al., 1990).

See also choroideremia, deafness, and mental retardation (303110), a
contiguous gene deletion syndrome involving the CHM and POU3F4 (300039)
genes on Xq21; X-linked deafness-2 with stapes fixation (DFNX2; 304400)
is caused by mutation in the CHM gene.

CLINICAL FEATURES

Affected males suffer progressive loss of vision (reduction of central
vision, constriction of visual fields, night blindness) beginning at an
early age, and the choroid and retina undergo complete atrophy.
Heterozygous females show no visual defect but often show striking
funduscopic changes such as irregular pigmentation and atrophy around
the optic disc (Cremers et al., 1989; Lesko et al., 1987; Ohba and
Isashiki, 2000). Fully affected females have been reported (Fraser and
Friedmann, 1967; Shapira and Sitney, 1943). These raise the usual
questions of X-chromosomal aberration, unfortunate lyonization in a
heterozygote, homozygosity, etc.

Stankovic (1958) reported a family with 'choroidal sclerosis,' which was
of interest because female carriers showed partial expression. Sorsby
(cited in Franceschetti et al., 1963) was of the opinion that the cases
reported by Sorsby and Savory (1956) as X-linked choroidal sclerosis
were instances of choroideremia. Krill and Archer (1971) were of the
same view. An extensive study in Holland was conducted by Kurstjens
(1965). Harris and Miller (1968) observed visual impairment in a
heterozygote in the family reported earlier by McCulloch and McCulloch
(1948). From study of affected members of 1 kindred, Shapiro and Gorlin
(1974) concluded that choroidal sclerosis is a stage in the evolution of
choroideremia.

In Finland, about 58 cases had been identified by 1980 (Forsius et al.,
1980). Almost all of them come from the northern part of the country.
Karna (1986) traced 111 choroideremia patients and 188 carriers in 4
kindreds from northern Finland and 1 from the Savo district. A large
proportion of both groups, 80 patients and 126 carriers, were examined
ophthalmologically. The largest of the kindreds, from the Salla area of
Finland, had 80 cases and 146 carriers in 8 generations among the more
than 3,000 descendants of an ancestral female. The clinical picture
proved unexpectedly variable with some males already virtually blind
under age 30 years and others over age 50 who were symptom-free. By
history only 7 of 105 carriers had symptoms but 21 of 52 carriers
examined had changes in the visual fields and defective dark adaptation.
Decline in the latter function over a 3-year period was observed in 1
heterozygote and the changes, including funduscopic alterations, were
most marked in older carriers. It was often difficult to be sure of the
diagnosis before the person was 10 years of age, but the diagnosis was
made in 2 boys aged 3 months and 10 months.

Cheung et al. (2004) showed that the multifocal electroretinogram might
be a sensitive tool to measure functional abnormalities in choroideremia
carriers. They also noted that mosaic inactivation of the normal allele
might cause expression of the mutation with severe visual loss in some
choroideremia carriers.

Grover et al. (2002) compared the extent of intraocular light scatter
(straylight) in carriers of CHM and the various forms of X-linked
retinitis pigmentosa (XLRP) to clarify the relationship between
photoreceptor cell degeneration and intraocular light scatter in
hereditary retinal degenerations. The carriers of XLRP who had evidence
of photoreceptor cell dysfunction (as determined by visual field loss
and reduced electroretinogram amplitudes) had increased levels of
intraocular straylight, whereas the carriers of CHM, who showed fundus
abnormalities alone, in the absence of demonstrable photoreceptor cell
dysfunction, had normal or minimally elevated levels of light scatter.
The authors concluded that the increased levels of intraocular light
scatter observed in some patients with hereditary retinal degenerations
may result from subclinical changes in the posterior subcapsular
cataract portion of the crystalline lens as a consequence of
photoreceptor cell degeneration.

Mura et al. (2007) reported the clinical, functional, and in vivo
microanatomic characteristics of a family with choroideremia with a
deletion of the entire CHM gene. At 4 years of age, the proband had a
hypopigmented fundus, retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) mottling, and
reduced dark-adapted electroretinograms (ERGs). Severe RPE and
choriocapillaris atrophy developed by age 6 years, paralleled by a
lesser ERG decline. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) findings showed
normal neural retina overlying mild changes in the RPE as well as
thinned neural retina with impaired lamination over RPE and
choriocapillaris atrophy. The carrier mother had diffuse elevation of
650-nm dark-adapted thresholds. Mura et al. (2007) concluded that
deletion of the CHM gene causes severe choroideremia. Results of serial
ERGs and fundus examinations documented progression first of rod and
then cone disease. Fundus appearance deteriorated rapidly, in excess of
the severity of the ERG decline. OCT findings explained this
observation, at least in part.

NOMENCLATURE

The term choroideremia, which is comparable to irideremia and means
absence of choroid, is, strictly speaking, inappropriate since there is
no congenital absence of the choroid. The condition is an abiotrophy
beginning shortly after birth and progressing gradually. Waardenburg
favored the alternative designation 'tapetochoroidal dystrophy' (TCD)
(Pameyer et al., 1960).

DIAGNOSIS

MacDonald et al. (1998) concluded that the clinical diagnosis of CHM can
be confirmed simply by immunoblot analysis with anti-REP1 antibody,
showing the absence of REP1 protein in peripheral blood samples. Because
all known mutations in the CHM gene create stop codons that truncate the
protein product and result in absence of REP1, the authors predicted
that most patients with CHM may be diagnosed by this procedure.

MAPPING

Nussbaum et al. (1985) found that the polymorphic DNA probe DXYS1,
located at Xq13-q21, shows no recombination with choroideremia (lod =
5.78). This result indicates that, with 90% probability, choroideremia
maps within 9 cM of DXYS1. Lesko et al. (1985) had a lod score of 12 for
0.0 recombination with DXYS1. Gal et al. (1986) suggested the following
order: Xcen--DXYS1--DXS3--TCD--DXS11--Xqter. DXS3 maps to Xq21.3-q22 and
DXS11 to Xq24-q26 (HGM8). Lesko et al. (1987) found recombination
frequencies of 0 to 4% between TCD and 5 markers located in Xq13-q22.
Uhlhaas et al. (1987) also provided data on linkage to multiple DNA
markers. MacDonald et al. (1987) found a maximum lod score of 3.98 at
theta = 0.14 for linkage with DXS3 and a total maximum lod score from
all studies of 5.23 at theta = 0.05 for DXYS1. These findings
represented looser linkage than had previously been reported. In a study
of 14 families, Wright et al. (1990) found linkage to 3 markers on Xq21,
giving a 4 point lod score of 8.25. No evidence of submicroscopic
deletion was observed using 2 DNA markers thought to lie within 1 Mb of
the TCD gene. Siu et al. (1988, 1990) found a de novo balanced
translocation, t(X;13)(q21.2;p12), in a patient with choroideremia. They
found evidence that the DXYS1 locus is distal to the choroideremia gene;
the derivative chromosome 13 carried a RFLP allele of this locus.
Cremers et al. (1989) reported a case of a female with TCD and a de novo
X-autosome translocation. Merry et al. (1990) also studied the X;13
translocation described by Siu et al. (1988).

- Genealogic Studies

Sankila et al. (1986, 1987) urged a historical-genealogic approach to
linkage analysis. In studies of isolated populations, they found that
all of 36 patients and 48 carriers with choroideremia in Finland had the
same haplotype: TCD/DXYS1, 11 kb/DXYS12, 1.6 kb. The DXYS1 locus and the
DXYS12 locus are located at Xq13-q21 and Xq13-q22, respectively. Given
that at least 105 female meioses transmitting TCD occurred in these
kindreds since 1650, extremely close linkage between the 3 loci is
suggested. Sankila et al. (1987) also reported haplotype data on Finnish
TCD using multiple DNA probes and presented evidence on the order of the
several marker loci and TCD. Multipoint linkage analysis by Sankila et
al. (1989) placed TCD distal to PGK (311800) and DXS72, very close to
DXYS1 and DXYS5 (maximum lod = 24 at theta = 0) and proximal to DXYS4.

Using DNA markers in 3 Danish families, Schwartz et al. (1986) provided
further evidence for assignment for the choroideremia locus to Xq13-q21.

- Deletion Studies

Hodgson et al. (1987) described a family in which an X-chromosome
deletion was segregating with choroideremia. The affected male was also
mentally retarded. The loss of 2 RFLPs in the affected male indicated
the localization of the choroideremia locus to Xq13-q21 and placed the
loci for anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (305100) and the X-linked
immunodeficiencies (e.g., 300755) outside this region. Schwartz et al.
(1987) mapped the TCD locus by demonstrating deletion of 3 XY-probes in
2 males with choroideremia and X-chromosomal deletion. Nussbaum et al.
(1987) studied 2 families in which males with choroideremia also had
mental retardation and deafness (303110). In 1 family an interstitial
deletion in Xq21 was visible by cytogenetic analysis, and 2 DNA markers,
DXYS1 and DXS72, were deleted. In the second family, an interstitial
deletion was suspected on phenotypic grounds but could not be confirmed
by high-resolution cytogenetic analysis.

Using subtractive hybridization, Lesko et al. (1987) isolated and
characterized the sequences deleted from an individual with
choroideremia and a visible deletion at Xq21. In 1 patient with no
visible deletion, submicroscopic deletion was indicated by the absence
of 2 single-copy sequences. Using these sequences as probes for in situ
hybridization, Lesko et al. (1987) localized the choroideremia gene to
Xq21. In 2 of 8 unrelated male patients with choroideremia, Cremers et
al. (1987) found deletion of DXS165, which maps to Xq12-q21.3. Two other
closely linked and probably flanking TCD markers, DXYS1 and DXS72, were
not deleted, which may indicate that the physical distance between
DXS165 and TCD is small. Schwartz et al. (1988) used DNA from 2
unrelated males who had choroideremia and an interstitial deletion on
the proximal long arm of the X chromosome. In one the deletion was
Xq21.1-q21.33; in the other the deletion was Xq21.2-q21.31. By Southern
blot analysis, the authors mapped 10 different polymorphic DNA loci to
the deletion and to the TCD locus. One probe was shown to cover one of
the breakpoints of the smaller deletion.

INHERITANCE

Choroideremia is an X-linked disorder. In his Atlas of the Fundus Oculi,
Wilmer (1934) showed the fundus of a 35-year-old man with 'choroidal
sclerosis' whose maternal grandfather was also affected. Furthermore, 2
brothers and the maternal grandfather of the proband's maternal
grandfather were also affected, i.e., the proband had inherited the
disorder from his great-great-grandfather through the intermediacy of a
carrier mother and great-grandmother.

CYTOGENETICS

Siu et al. (1988, 1990) found a de novo balanced translocation, t(X;13)
(q21.2;p12), in a patient with choroideremia (303100). Cremers et al.
(1989) reported another case of a female with TCD and a de novo
X-autosome translocation. Merry et al. (1990) also studied the X;13
translocation described by Siu et al. (1988). Van Bokhoven et al. (1994)
demonstrated that the breakpoint on the X chromosome in a CHM female
with an X;7 translocation lay between exons 3 and 4 of the CHM gene.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Van den Hurk et al. (1992) analyzed the CHM gene in 30 choroideremia
patients and identified 5 different nonsense and frameshift mutations in
5 probands (300390.0002-300390.0006, respectively). Each of these
mutations introduced a termination codon into the open reading frame of
the CHM candidate gene, thereby predicting a distinct truncated protein
product.

In affected individuals from 16 branches of a large, 13-generation Salla
pedigree from northeastern Finnish Lapland that accounted for one-fifth
of the world's choroideremia patients, Sankila et al. (1992) identified
a splice site mutation in the CHM gene (300390.0001), predicted to
result in a truncated gene product. The mutation was unique in that it
was not responsible for choroideremia in any of 4 additional Finnish
pedigrees. Haplotyping performed by Sankila et al. (1987) had previously
suggested that the large northern Finnish choroideremia pedigrees
carried the same mutation.

In 6 patients with choroideremia from 12 Danish families, Schwartz et
al. (1993) identified a nonsense mutation in the CHM gene (300390.0007).

Van Bokhoven et al. (1994) reviewed the spectrum of mutations in the CHM
gene in patients from 15 Danish and Swedish families. They noted that
all CHM gene mutations detected to that time gave rise to the
introduction of a premature stop codon.

In a male patient with choroideremia, van den Hurk et al. (2003)
identified an insertion of a full-length L1 retroposon in the coding
region of the CHM gene (300390.0010).

Perez-Cano et al. (2009) analyzed the X-inactivation pattern in 12
carrier females, 1 of whom was severely affected, from 2 Mexican
choroideremia families with mutations in the CHM gene. The X-chromosome
inactivation pattern was random in 11 of the 12 females, including the
affected female, who exhibited a fundus phenotype comparable to diseased
males. The remaining carrier female, who had a conspicuous pattern of
pigment epithelium mottling primarily in the peripheral retina, was
found to have a skewed inactivation pattern; however, further analysis
revealed that the preferentially inactivated X chromosome was the
mutation-carrying X chromosome. Perez-Cano et al. (2009) stated that
their results did not support a correlation between X-inactivation
status and abnormal retinal phenotype in heterozygous carrier females.

Esposito et al. (2011) screened 20 Italian probands with choroideremia
and identified mutations in the CHM gene in all but 1 of the men, in
whom the authors concluded that the phenotype might overlap with that of
other X-linked retinopathies. All of the variants were nonsense or
frameshift mutations or deletions except for 1 missense mutation (H507R;
300390.0011), which segregated with disease in the proband's family, was
not found in 200 control alleles, and caused functional impairment of
REP1 due to exclusion from the isoprenylation cycle. Esposito et al.
(2011) stated that this was the first evidence that a prenylation
deficiency is necessary to cause CHM.

PATHOGENESIS

In the rat, Seabra et al. (1992) purified component A of RAB
geranylgeranyl transferase, a single 95-kD polypeptide. The holoenzyme,
which consists of components A and B (179080), attaches
(3)H-geranylgeranyl to cysteines in 2 GTP-binding proteins, RAB3A
(179490) and RAB1A (179508). The reaction is abolished when both
cysteines in the COOH-terminal cys-cys sequence of RAB1A are mutated to
serines. Six peptides from rat component A showed striking similarity to
the products of the gene defective in choroideremia. The choroideremia
protein resembles RAB3A GDI, which binds RAB3A. Seabra et al. (1992)
suggested that component A binds conserved sequences in RAB and that
component B transfers geranylgeranyl. A defect in this reaction may
cause choroideremia. Seabra et al. (1993) established this to be the
case by demonstrating that lymphoblasts from choroideremia subjects have
a marked deficiency in the activity of component A, but not component B,
of RAB GG transferase. The deficiency was more pronounced when the
substrate was RAB3A, a synaptic vesicle protein, than it was when the
substrate was RAB1A, a protein of the endoplasmic reticulum. Their
studies suggested the existence of multiple component A proteins, one of
which is missing in choroideremia. The multiplicity and functional
redundancy of component A genes creates a situation in which defects in
one of them might cause a degenerative disease of the organ in which
that particular form of component A is most essential.

To clarify the pathogenesis of CHM, Syed et al. (2001) performed
histopathologic examination, including immunocytochemistry with an
antibody against the CHM gene product, REP1, and retinal cell-specific
markers, on the eyes of an 88-year-old symptomatic female carrier of CHM
and 6 normal, age-matched donors. The CHM carrier retina showed patchy
degeneration, but the photoreceptor and retinal pigment epithelium loss
appeared to be independent. The choriocapillaris was normal except where
the retina had degenerated severely. REP1 was localized in the cytoplasm
of rods but not cones. The authors stated that photoreceptor
degeneration in CHM is generally considered secondary to the loss of
choriocapillaris or retinal pigment epithelium. This study suggested
that the rod photoreceptors might be the primary site of disease in CHM.

ANIMAL MODEL

By conditional knockout of the Chm gene, Tolmachova et al. (2006)
created a mouse model of choroideremia: heterozygous-null females
exhibited characteristic hallmarks of CHM, with progressive degeneration
of photoreceptors, patchy depigmentation of the retinal pigment
epithelium, and Rab prenylation defects. Using tamoxifen-inducible and
tissue-specific Cre expression in combination with conditionally deleted
Chm alleles, Tolmachova et al. (2006) showed that CHM pathogenesis
involves independently triggered degeneration of photoreceptors and the
retinal pigment epithelium, associated with different subsets of
defective Rabs.

HISTORY

Close linkage of choroideremia with the Xg locus was excluded by Bell
and McCulloch (1971), who found 3 recombinants out of 6.

612439	TITLE *612439 ADP-RIBOSYLATION FACTOR GTPase-ACTIVATING PROTEIN 3; ARFGAP3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ADP ribosylation factors (ARFs) are critical in intracellular vesicular
trafficking. GTP hydrolysis by ARFs requires interaction with
GTPase-activating proteins, such as ARFGAP3 (Zhang et al., 2000).

CLONING

By large-scale sequencing of clones obtained from a fetal liver cDNA
library, followed by database analysis and 5-prime RACE, Zhang et al.
(2000) cloned ARFGAP3, which they called ARFGAP1. The deduced 516-amino
acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 57 kD and is 28%
identical to rat Arfgap1 (608377). ARFGAP3 has an N-terminal GATA1
(305371)-type zinc finger motif containing 4 cysteines that is highly
conserved among ARFGAPs, as well as multiple potential phosphorylation
sites. Northern blot analysis detected a 2.7-kb transcript in all fetal
tissues and cancer cell lines examined. RNA dot blot analysis revealed
variable ARFGAP3 expression in all adult and fetal tissues examined.
Highest expression was in testis and endocrine tissues, including
pancreas, adrenal gland, pituitary, salivary gland, and prostate.

Liu et al. (2001) found that fluorescence-tagged ARFGAP3 concentrated in
the perinuclear region of transfected COS-7 cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Using purified recombinant proteins, Liu et al. (2001) demonstrated that
ARFGAP3 stimulated ARF1 (103180)-mediated GTP hydrolysis in a
concentration-dependent manner. Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate
acted as an ARFGAP3 agonist, and phosphatidylcholine acted as an ARFGAP3
antagonist. Overexpression of ARFGAP3 in COS-7 cells reduced
constitutive secretion of secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP; 171800),
indicating that ARFGAP3 regulates the early secretory pathway of
proteins.

Using rat, monkey, and human cell lines, Frigerio et al. (2007) showed
that ARFGAP2 (606908) and ARFGAP3 functioned in intracellular
trafficking of COPI (601924)-coated vesicles. Both ARFGAP2 and ARFGAP3
colocalized with COPI subunits in the Golgi complex and peripheral
punctate structures and associated with COPI-coated vesicles generated
from Golgi membranes. Silencing of ARFGAP1 or a combination of ARFGAP2
and ARFGAP3 in HeLa cells did not decrease cell viability, but silencing
of all 3 ARFGAPs caused cell death.

GENE STRUCTURE

Zhang et al. (2000) determined that the ARFGAP3 gene contains 16 exons
and spans about 60 kb. The upstream region is 73.87% GC and includes 2
potential SP1 (189906)-binding sites. It has no CAAT or TATA box
elements.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid and genomic sequence analyses, Zhang et al. (2000)
mapped the ARFGAP3 gene to chromosome 22q13.2.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Calcineurin, a calmodulin-regulated protein phosphatase, is found in the
cells of all eukaryotes ranging from yeast to mammals. Wang et al.
(1996) described this heterodimeric protein as having a 19-kD
Ca(2+)-binding regulatory subunit, calcineurin B, and a 58- to 59-kD
catalytic subunit, calcineurin A. One gene encodes calcineurin B
(PPP3R1; 601302) in all tissues except testis, and it is highly
conserved at the level of both protein and DNA sequences in eukaryotes.
In contrast, there are 2 major isoforms, alpha (PPP3CA; 114105) and beta
(PPP3CB), of calcineurin A encoded by separate genes located on
different human chromosomes. A third isoform, A-gamma (PPP3CC; 114107),
is unique to testis. Additional diversity of calcineurin A is created by
alternative splicing of mRNAs. Calcineurin is especially abundant in
brain where it constitutes 1% of total protein.

MAPPING

By Southern analysis of human/hamster hybrid cell lines, Giri et al.
(1991) demonstrated that the CALNA2 gene is located on chromosome 10.
Wang et al. (1996) confirmed the assignment to chromosome 10 by Southern
blot analysis and regionalized the assignment to 10q21-q22 by isotopic
in situ hybridization.

GENE FUNCTION

Wang et al. (2011) found that Cna-alpha and -beta were critical in
executing a proapoptotic program following exposure of neonatal rat
cardiomyocytes to anoxia. Cna-alpha and -beta dephosphorylated the
mitochondrial fission protein Drp1 (DNM1L; 603850), permitting
translocation of Drp1 from the cytosol to mitochondria, followed by
mitochondrial fragmentation and apoptosis. Wang et al. (2011)
characterized upstream events in this apoptotic pathway and found that
p53 (191170) downregulated expression of microRNA-499 (MIR499; 613614),
which relieved Mir499-dependent repression of Cna-alpha and -beta.
Knockdown of either Cna-alpha or Cna-beta via small interfering RNA
attenuated Drp1 accumulation in mitochondria, mitochondria
fragmentation, and anoxia-induced cell death.

ANIMAL MODEL

In cardiomyocytes, calcineurin signaling has been implicated in the
regulation of the hypertrophic response caused by pressure overload or
neuroendocrine stimulation. Bueno et al. (2002) evaluated the necessary
function of calcineurin as a hypertrophic regulatory factor by
disrupting 1 of the 3 genes that encode the catalytic subunit,
calcineurin A-beta, in the mouse. Calcineurin A-beta-deficient mice were
viable, fertile, and overtly normal into adulthood, but displayed an 80%
decrease in calcineurin enzymatic activity in the heart that was
associated with a 12% reduction in basal heart size. Deficient mice were
dramatically impaired in their ability to mount a productive
hypertrophic response induced by pressure overload, angiotensin II
(300034) infusion, or isoproterenol infusion. Analysis of marker genes
associated with the hypertrophic response revealed a partial defect in
the molecular program of hypertrophy. Collectively, these data
solidified the hypothesis that calcineurin functions as a central
regulator of the cardiac hypertrophic growth response in vivo.

615467	TITLE *615467 GLYCOLIPID TRANSFER PROTEIN DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1; GLTPD1
;;GLTP DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1;;
CERAMIDE-1-PHOSPHATE TRANSFER PROTEIN, CPTP
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

GLTPD1 transfers the sphingolipid ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P) between
intracellular membranes (Simanshu et al., 2013).

CLONING

By searching databases for transcripts similar to glycolipid transfer
protein (GLTP; 608949), Simanshu et al. (2013) identified GLTPD1, which
they called CPTP. The deduced protein contains 214 amino acids. PCR
analysis detected variable CPTP expression in all 16 human tissues
examined, with highest expression in placenta, kidney, pancreas, and
testis. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed CPTP localization in the
cytosol and in association with the trans-Golgi network (TGN),
endosomes, nucleus, and plasma membrane.

GENE FUNCTION

Simanshu et al. (2013) showed that recombinant human CPTP transferred
labeled C1P between donor and acceptor vesicles of different lipid
composition in a protein concentration-dependent manner. Competition
experiments revealed optimized binding of 16:0 and 18:1 C1P species.
Knockdown of CPTP using small interfering RNA (siRNA) elevated cellular
content of 16:0 C1P and 24:1 C1P, decreased cellular content of
sphingosines, sphingomyelins, and ceramides, and induced fragmentation
of Golgi cisternal stacks. C1P accumulation in the TGN following siRNA
against CPTP increased proinflammatory arachidonic acid and eicosanoid
generation.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Simanshu et al. (2013) determined the crystal structure of purified
human CPTP in complex with 16:0-C1P to 1.9-angstrom resolution. CPTP
assumed a 2-layered alpha-helical topology with a positively-charged
surface cavity for anchoring the lipid phosphate head group and a deep
interior hydrophobic cavity to accommodate sphingosine and acyl chains.
CPTP showed 2 lipid-binding conformations, one a 'sphingosine-in' mode
where both ceramide chains occupied the hydrophobic pocket, and the
other a 'sphingosine-out' mode where only the acyl chain occupied the
pocket. Mutation analysis revealed that lys60 and arg106 of CPTP were
critical for head group recognition.

GENE STRUCTURE

Simanshu et al. (2013) determined that the GLTPD1 gene has 3 exons.

MAPPING

Simanshu et al. (2013) stated that the GLTPD1 gene maps to chromosome
1p36.33.

608822	TITLE *608822 KERATIN-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 1-5; KRTAP1-5
;;KAP1.5
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The main structural proteins of mammalian hair fiber are the hair
keratins (see 601077) and the keratin-associated proteins, which form a
rigid and resistant hair shaft through extensive disulfide bond
crosslinking with the abundant cysteines of hair keratins (Shimomura et
al., 2002).

CLONING

By screening a human PAC library and an arrayed human scalp cDNA
library, Rogers et al. (2001) cloned KAP1.5. The deduced 174-amino acid
protein has a calculated molecular mass of 18.0 kD. KAP1.5 is classified
as a high sulfur protein owing to a cysteine content of 24.1 mol %. It
contains 2 unique motifs conserved among KAP1 family members, several
characteristic pentapeptide repeats, and a 20-amino acid subdomain that
was conserved among KAP1 family members in all species examined. In situ
hybridization to cryosections of human scalp epidermis showed expression
of KAP1.5 in the middle/upper portions of the hair cortex, in the region
termed the keratogenous zone.

While Shimomura et al. (2002) found polymorphism in the KAP1.1 (608819)
and KAP1.3 (608820) genes in Japanese and Caucasian individuals, they
found none in the KAP1.5 gene.

GENE STRUCTURE

Rogers et al. (2001) stated that the KRTAP1-5 gene is about 1.0 kb long
and consists of a single exon.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Rogers et al. (2001) mapped the KRTAP1-5
gene to a region of chromosome 17q12-q21 that contains 8 other
identified KAP genes or pseudogenes.

609433	TITLE *609433 UBIQUITIN INTERACTION MOTIF-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1; UIMC1
;;RECEPTOR-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN, 80-KD; RAP80
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By differential display of RNA expressed by young proliferating and
senescent normal human epidermal keratinocytes, followed by screening a
testis cDNA library, Yan et al. (2002) cloned RAP80. The deduced
719-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 79.6 kD. The
N-terminal half of RAP80 contains 2 nuclear localization signals and a
putative ubiquitin interaction motif. The C-terminal half contains a
potential PEST sequence, 2 zinc fingers, and a third nuclear
localization signal. Northern blot analysis detected a major 2.6-kb
transcript expressed highly in testis and moderately in ovary, thymus,
and heart. In situ hybridization of mouse testis detected Rap80
associated with germ cells, with little expression in surrounding Leydig
cells. No significant differences in the level of Rap80 were found
between developmental subpopulations of germ cells, suggesting that
Rap80 expression is not developmentally regulated. Immunofluorescence
localization detected RAP80 in a speckled nuclear distribution in a
transfected monkey kidney cell line, and mutation analysis indicated
that the second nuclear localization signal directed intracellular
localization.

GENE FUNCTION

Yan et al. (2002) found that RAP80 decreased basal transcription of a
reporter gene in transfected Chinese hamster ovary and monkey kidney
cell lines. Yeast 2-hybrid analysis indicated that RAP80 could interact
with the retinoid-related testis-associated receptor (RTR; 602778), but
not with retinoid receptors (see RXRA; 180245) or other nuclear
receptors tested. Cotransfection experiments showed that RAP80 and RTR
interacted with each other in a dose-dependent manner. Mutation analysis
indicated that several regions of RAP80 were important for optimal
interaction with RTR. RAP80 inhibited the interaction of NCOR (600849)
with RTR in a concentration-dependent manner, and RAP80 and NCOR
appeared to compete with each other for RTR binding.

Wang et al. (2007) showed that Abraxas (ABRA1; 611143), a protein that
binds BRCA1 (113705), recruits the ubiquitin-interacting motif
(UIM)-containing protein RAP80 to the BRCA1 complex. Both Abraxas and
RAP80 were required for DNA damage resistance, G2/M checkpoint control,
and DNA repair. RAP80 was required for optimal accumulation of BRCA1 on
damaged DNA (foci) in response to ionizing radiation, and the UIM
domains alone were capable of foci formation. Wang et al. (2007)
concluded that the RAP80-Abraxas complex may help recruit BRCA1 to DNA
damage sites in part through recognition of ubiquitinated proteins.

Sobhian et al. (2007) reported the interaction of the BRCT (BRCA1
C-terminal) BRCA1 domain with the ubiquitin-binding protein RAP80. RAP80
targets a complex containing the BRCA1-BARD1 (601593) E3 ligase and the
deubiquitinating enzyme BRCC36 (300617) to MDC1 (607593)-gamma-H2AX
(601772)-dependent lys6- and lys63-linked ubiquitin polymers at
double-strand breaks. Sobhian et al. (2007) stated that these events are
required for cell cycle checkpoint and repair responses to ionizing
radiation, implicating ubiquitin chain recognition and turnover in the
BRCA1-mediated repair of double-strand breaks.

Kim et al. (2007) independently reported the identification of AP80 as a
BRCA1-interacting protein in humans. RAP80 contains a tandem UIM domain,
which is required for its binding with ubiquitin in vitro and its
damage-induced foci formation in vivo. Moreover, Kim et al. (2007)
showed that RAP80 specifically recruits BRCA1 to DNA damage sites and
functions with BRCA1 in G2/M checkpoint control. Kim et al. (2007)
concluded that taken together, their results suggested the existence of
a ubiquitination-dependent signaling pathway involved in the DNA damage
response.

GENE STRUCTURE

Yan et al. (2002) determined that the RAP80 gene contains 15 exons and
spans more than 90 kb.

MAPPING

By FISH, Yan et al. (2002) mapped the UIMC1 gene to chromosome 5q35.

603050	TITLE *603050 ABL INTERACTOR 1; ABI1
;;SPECTRIN SH3 DOMAIN-BINDING PROTEIN 1; SSH3BP1;;
E3B1
ABI1/MLL FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Taki et al. (1998) identified the ABI1 gene as the fusion partner with
MLL (159555) in a patient with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and a
t(10;11)(p11.2;q23) ABI1 is a human homolog of mouse Abl-interactor-1
(Abi1). The ABI1 protein exhibited sequence similarity to protein of
homeotic genes, contained several polyproline stretches, and included a
Src homology-3 (SH3) domain at the C terminus that is required for
binding of mouse Abi1 protein to Abl proteins. Three types of the ABI1
gene were expressed in normal peripheral blood. The MLL-ABI1 fusion
transcript in this patient was formed by an alternatively spliced ABI1.
In-frame MLL-ABI1 fusion transcripts combined the MLL AT-hook motifs and
DNA methyltransferase homology region with the homeodomain homologous
region, polyproline stretches, and SH3 domain of the alternatively
spliced transcript of ABI1. The results suggested that ABI1 plays a role
in the leukemogenesis by translocating to MLL.

Taki et al. (1998) noted the similarity between the protein they
described and the E3B1 protein described by Biesova et al. (1997), which
was also isolated as a human homolog of mouse Abi1.

MAPPING

Taki et al. (1998) identified the ABI1 gene on chromosome 10p11.2 as the
fusion partner of MLL in a patient with acute myeloid leukemia.

GENE FUNCTION

Scita et al. (1999) demonstrated that EPS8 (600206) and E3B1/ABI1
participate in the transduction of signals from Ras (190020) to Rac (see
602048) by regulating Rac-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor
(GEF) activities. Scita et al. (1999) also showed that EPS8, E3B1, and
SOS1 (182530) form a tricomplex in vivo that exhibits Rac-specific GEF
activity in vitro. Scita et al. (1999) proposed a model in which EPS8
mediates the transfer of signals between Ras and Rac by forming a
complex with E3B1 and SOS1.

Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR; 131550) signaling involves small
GTPases of the Rho family, and EGFR trafficking involves small GTPases
of the Rab family. Lanzetti et al. (2000) reported that the EPS8 protein
connects these signaling pathways. EPS8 is a substrate of EGFR that is
held in a complex with SOS1 by the adaptor protein E3B1, thereby
mediating activation of RAC. Through its SH3 domain, EPS8 interacts with
RNTRE (605405). Lanzetti et al. (2000) showed that RNTRE is a RAB5
(179512) GTPase-activating protein whose activity is regulated by EGFR.
By entering in a complex with EPS8, RNTRE acts on RAB5 and inhibits
internalization of the EGFR. Furthermore, RNTRE diverts EPS8 from its
RAC-activating function, resulting in the attenuation of RAC signaling.
Thus, depending on its state of association with E3B1 or RNTRE, EPS8
participates in both EGFR signaling through RAC and EGFR trafficking
through RAB5.

Using a yeast 2-hybrid assay, Tani et al. (2003) found that human ABI1
bound mouse Mena (ENAH; 609061). Binding analysis revealed that the EVH1
domain of Mena bound a polyproline structure of ABI1. Endogenous MENA
and ABL1 (189980) coprecipitated with epitope-tagged ABI1 from human
embryonic kidney cells. ABI1 dramatically promoted ABL1-mediated
tyrosine phosphorylation of MENA, but not of other substrates. Mutation
analysis demonstrated that Mena was tyrosine phosphorylated on tyr296.

611859	TITLE *611859 MITOCHONDRIAL RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN L55; MRPL55
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Mitochondria have their own translation system for production of 13
inner membrane proteins essential for oxidative phosphorylation. MRPL55
is a component of the large subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome that
is encoded by the nuclear genome (Koc et al., 2001).

CLONING

By searching databases using bovine Mrpl55 as query, Koc et al. (2001)
identified human MRPL55. They also identified MRPL55 homologs in mouse,
Drosophila, and C. elegans, but not in yeast, E. coli, or Arabidopsis.
Mouse and human MRPL55 share 71.7% amino acid identity.

MAPPING

Hartz (2008) mapped the MRPL55 gene to chromosome 1q42.13 based on an
alignment of the MRPL55 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AY358771) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.1).

602493	TITLE *602493 UV RADIATION RESISTANCE-ASSOCIATED GENE; UVRAG
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Teitz et al. (1990) identified a cDNA that partially complements the
ultraviolet (UV) sensitivity of xeroderma pigmentosum complementation
group C (278720) cells. Perelman et al. (1997) named this gene 'UV
radiation resistance-associated gene' (UVRAG) and reported that the 4.0
kb UVRAG mRNA encodes a predicted 648-amino acid protein. Using cell
fractionation studies, they found that the UVRAG protein either is
localized within an organelle or is part of the cytoskeleton. Northern
blot analysis showed that UVRAG is expressed ubiquitously in humans; it
was also present in most of the vertebrate species tested.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization and PCR analysis of somatic cell
hybrids, Perelman et al. (1997) mapped the UVRAG gene to 11q13, between
D11S916 and D11S906.

606999	TITLE *606999 GALACTOSE-1-PHOSPHATE URIDYLYLTRANSFERASE; GALT
GALT/IL11RA SPLICED READ-THROUGH TRANSCRIPT, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase (GALT; EC 2.7.7.12) catalyzes
the interconversion of galactose-1-phosphate and glucose-1-phosphate via
transfer of uridine monophosphate.

CLONING

Reichardt and Berg (1988) used short peptide sequences conserved between
E. coli and yeast to isolate a human GALT cDNA clone. The deduced
379-amino acid protein has a molecular mass of approximately 43 kD.

- GALT/IL11RA Spliced Read-Through Transcript

Magrangeas et al. (1998) established the existence of poly(A) site
choice and fusion splicing of 2 adjacent genes, encoding
galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase and interleukin-11 receptor
alpha-chain (IL11RA; 600939), in normal human cells. This 16-kb
transcription unit contains 2 promoters (the first one constitutive, and
the second, 8 kb downstream, highly regulated) and 2
cleavage/polyadenylation signals separated by 12 kb. The promoter from
the GALT gene yields 2 mRNAs, a 1.4-kb mRNA encoding GALT and a 3-kb
fusion mRNA when the first poly(A) site is spliced out and the second
poly(A) site is used. The 3-kb mRNA codes for a fusion protein
containing part of the GALT protein and the entire IL11RA protein. The
GALT promoter/IL11RA poly(A) transcript results from leaky termination
and alternative splicing.

MAPPING

By gene dosage studies, Aitken and Ferguson-Smith (1979) assigned the
structural gene for GALT to the short arm of chromosome 9. Shih et al.
(1982, 1984) assigned the GALT locus to 9p13 by gene dosage. By deletion
mapping, Kondo and Nakamura (1984) corroborated the 9p13 localization.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a patient with classic galactosemia (230400), Reichardt and Woo
(1990, 1991) found a methionine-to-lysine change at codon 142 of the
GALT gene, which resulted in reduction of the specific activity of the
mutated protein to about 4% of normal (606999.0001).

The Duarte polymorphism was identified by Reichardt and Woo (1991), who
pointed out that the galactosemia mutations tend to occur in regions of
the gene that are highly conserved throughout evolution whereas the
polymorphisms change variable residues. Elsas et al. (1994) presented
evidence that the N314D substitution, a 940A-G transition in exon 10
(dbSNP rs2070074; 606999.0005), is a common allele that causes the
Duarte GALT biochemical phenotype of reduced enzyme activity, known as
the 'D2' variant. Elsas et al. (1994) found that the N314D substitution
occurs in a predominantly Caucasian, nongalactosemic population, with a
prevalence of 5.9%. When found in cis with a silent mutation, L218L
(dbSNP rs2070075; 606999.0012), the Duarte allele N314D causes increased
enzyme activity, known as the 'Los Angeles' or 'D1' variant.
Subsequently, Kozak et al. (1999) showed that a 4-bp deletion
(-119delGTCA; 606999.0017) in the 5-prime region of the GALT gene was
linked with the Duarte allele and conferred reduced enzymatic activity.
Carney et al. (2009) showed that the 5-prime 4-bp deletion is the causal
mutation in Duarte galactosemia and suggested that direct tests for this
deletion could enhance or supplant current tests.

In Japan, where classic galactosemia is thought to be only one-twentieth
as frequent as it is in Caucasian populations of the United States,
Ashino et al. (1995) reported 2 novel GALT mutations in 2 Japanese
patients with GALT deficiency and found also the N314D substitution
responsible for the Duarte variant and the arg333-to-trp mutation
(R333W; 606999.0002) previously found in Caucasians.

Greber-Platzer et al. (1997) found from studies in 30 unrelated families
(24 Austrian, 2 Croatian, and 4 German) with classic galactosemia that
DGGE detected 59 of the 60 alleles. The Q188R mutation accounted for 60%
of these alleles; K285N (606999.0013) accounted for 28%. In addition,
they found 8 novel candidate galactosemia mutations. In all D2 variants,
N314D occurred in cis with 2 intronic sequence changes; in 3 patients
with the D1 variant, N314D was in cis with a neutral mutation in exon 7
(L218L).

Elsas and Lai (1998) stated that more than 130 mutations in the GALT
gene (606999) had been associated with GALT deficiency. Two common
mutations, Q188R (606999.0006) and K285N (606999.0013), accounted for
more than 70% of galactosemia-producing alleles in the white population
and were associated with classic galactosemia and impaired GALT
function. In the black population, S135L (606999.0010) accounted for 62%
of the alleles causing galactosemia and was associated with good
outcomes. A large 5-kb deletion in the GALT gene was identified in
Ashkenazi Jews. A comprehensive review of the 120 or more mutations was
provided.

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

Elsas et al. (1995) described a strategy for identifying new mutations
in the GALT gene. A total of 12 new and 21 previously reported rare
mutations were found. Among the novel group of 12 new mutations, an
unusual biochemical phenotype was found in a family in which the newborn
proband had classic galactosemia. From the father, he had inherited 2
mutations in cis: asn314 to asp (N314D; 606999.0005) and glu203 to lys
(E203K; 606999.0014). From the mother, he had inherited a mutation in
the splice acceptor site of intron C of the GALT gene. The GALT activity
in erythrocytes of the father, who was heterozygous for the double
mutation, was near normal. An asymptomatic sister showed compound
heterozygosity for 3 mutations: E203K-N314D/N314D. Surprisingly, her
erythrocytes had normal GALT activity. Elsas et al. (1995) speculated
that E203K and N314D codon changes produce intraallelic complementation
when in cis. The E203K mutation was located in codon 7 and was the
result of a GAG-to-AAG transition; the N314D mutation was in exon 10 and
resulted from an AAC-to-GAC transition. The latter mutation is a
frequent basis of the Duarte variant; the former was a new mutation
found in this study. The chromosome with only one mutation, N314D, came
from the proband's mother.

POPULATION GENETICS

- Classic Galactosemia

Data on gene frequencies of allelic variants were tabulated by
Roychoudhury and Nei (1988). Tyfield et al. (1999) stated that by the
end of 1998 more than 150 different base changes in the GALT gene were
recorded in 24 different populations and ethnic groups of 15 countries
worldwide.

Suzuki et al. (2001) estimated that the birth incidence of classic
galactosemia is 1 per 47,000 in the white population. Among whites,
Suzuki et al. (2001) found the frequency of the Q188R mutation
(606999.0006) to be 0.29%, and that of the K285N mutation (606999.0013)
to be 0.062%.

Murphy et al. (1999) estimated the incidence of classic
transferase-deficient galactosemia in Ireland and determined the
underlying GALT mutation spectrum in the Irish population and in the
Traveller group (an endogamous group of commercial/industrial nomads
within the Irish population). Based on a survey of newborn screening
records, the incidence of classic transferase-deficient galactosemia was
estimated to be 1 in 480 and 1 in 30,000 among Traveller and
non-Traveller communities, respectively. Fifty-six classic galactosemic
patients were screened for mutations in the GALT gene. Q188R was the
sole mutant allele among the Travellers, as well as being the most
frequent mutant allele among the non-Travellers (89.1%). Of the 5
non-Q188R mutant alleles in the non-Traveller group, one was R333G
(606999.0015) and one was F194L (606999.0016), with 3 remaining
uncharacterized. Anonymous population screening had shown the Q188R
carrier frequency to be 0.092 or 1 in 11 among the Travellers, as
compared with 0.009 or 1 in 107 among the non-Travellers. The Q188R
mutation was shown to be in linkage disequilibrium with a SacI RFLP
flanking exon 6 of the GALT gene. Lin and Reichardt (1995) demonstrated
that the Q188R mutation is in linkage disequilibrium with the SacI RFLP
in African American, Asian, Caucasian, and Latino galactosemic patients.
This was interpreted to indicate that the Q188R mutation arose once in
the history of the modern human population and was spread worldwide by
demic diffusion. The same disequilibrium in the Irish population
suggested that the Q188R mutation was present in the indigenous
population before the Travellers separated and was carried into the
Traveller population by its founders. The findings suggested,
furthermore, that the modern Traveller subpopulation in Ireland had an
endogenous origin. The high frequency of the Q188R allele appears to be
due to founder effect coupled with rapid expansion of this population.

- Duarte-1 and Duarte-2 Alleles

Vaccaro et al. (1984) studied the frequency of the Duarte and Los
Angeles variants of red cell gal-1-P uridylyltransferase in Italy; the 2
have similar electrophoretic patterns but the enzyme activity in
heterozygotes is about half normal in the former and about 1.5 times
normal in the latter. No apparent clinical abnormality accompanies
either. The allele frequencies were: N = 0.9192; G (for galactosemia) =
0.0036; D (for Duarte) = 0.0372 and LA (for Los Angeles) = 0.0400.

By cross-species comparison, Carney et al. (2009) found that all
non-human species, including chimpanzee, macaque, and mouse, encoded D
rather than N at codon 314, strongly implicating D314 as the ancestral
allele and suggesting the variant predominant in human is most
appropriately termed D314N. In primates, the CTA(Leu) codon
predominates, indicating CTA as the ancestral allele in humans. The
proximal 5-prime GALT sequence contains a repeated tetranucleotide
sequence of GTCA and predominates as a 3-repeat sequence (GTCA)3 in
humans and primates, whereas mice carry only 1 repeat (GTCA)1. Carney et
al. (2009) suggested that the repeat sequence appears to have expanded
through the course of evolution and the 4-bp deletion (606999.0017)
represents a contraction of 1 repeat. The authors reported that the
frequency of the D314 allele (606999.0005) in the CEPH HapMap sample is
11.3%, which is unusually high compared with Yoruba, Chinese, and
Japanese populations, which each exhibit frequencies of D314 well under
3%. The frequency of the TTA(Leu) codon (606999.0012) accounted for 4.5%
of alleles in the CEPH sample, whereas the frequency is even rarer in
non-European populations, with an observed frequency of about 1% in the
Chinese sample and a complete absence in the Yoruba and Japanese
samples.

HISTORY

Early studies on the mapping of the galactose-1-phosphate
uridylyltransferase locus yielded conflicting results, placing it on
chromosome 2 (Sun et al., 1973, 1974, 1977; Chu et al., 1975), and on
chromosome 3 (Tedesco et al., 1974; Allderdice and Tedesco, 1975).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
GALACTOSEMIA
GALT, MET142LYS

In a classic galactosemic patient (230400), Reichardt and Woo (1990,
1991) found a methionine-to-lysine change at a position that is
conserved in all eukaryotes sequenced to date but in none of the
prokaryotes. The mutation reduced the specific activity of the mutated
protein to about 4% of normal.

.0002
GALACTOSEMIA
GALT, ARG333TRP

In a patient with severe galactosemia (230400) and undetectable GALT
enzymatic activity, Reichardt and Woo (1990) and Reichardt et al. (1991)
found substitution of arginine-333 by tryptophan caused by a transition
at nucleotide 1025. The region surrounding this missense mutation is the
most highly conserved domain in the homologous enzymes of E. coli,
yeast, and humans. This mutation appears to be rare. See also
606999.0006 and Elsevier and Fridovich-Keil (1996).

.0003
GALACTOSEMIA
GALT, VAL44MET

Reichardt and Woo (1991) identified a substitution of valine-44 by
methionine in a patient with galactosemia (230400).

.0004
GALT POLYMORPHISM
GALT, LEU62MET

This polymorphism was identified by Reichardt and Woo (1991).

.0005
GALT POLYMORPHISM (DUARTE, D2)
GALT, ASN314ASP

This polymorphism was identified by Reichardt and Woo (1991). The
asn314-to-asp (N314D; dbSNP rs2070074) substitution results from a
940A-G transition in exon 10 of the GALT gene. In 111 biochemically
unphenotyped controls with no history of galactosemia, Elsas et al.
(1994) identified 13 N314D alleles. Using G for the allele causing
classic galactosemia and D for the Duarte allele, Elsas et al. (1994)
proposed that the D/N, D/D, and D/G genotypes show approximately 75%,
50%, and 25% of normal GALT activity, respectively. In addition, the
Duarte allele is associated with an isoform of the enzyme that has more
acidic pI than normal. This variant is known as Duarte, Duarte-2, or D2
(Holton et al., 2001).

Ashino et al. (1995) identified the N314D substitution in Japanese
patients with GALT deficiency and speculated that the mutation arose
before Asian and Caucasian peoples diverged. Carney et al. (2009)
reported that the frequency of the D314 allele in the CEPH HapMap sample
is 11.3%, which is unusually high compared with Yoruba, Chinese, and
Japanese populations, which each exhibit frequencies of D314 well under
3%.

The characteristic Duarte isoform is also associated with a variant
allele (652C-T; L218L; 606999.0012), yielding the 'Los Angeles (LA)
phenotype,' which has nearly normal or increased GALT enzyme activity.
Podskarbi et al. (1996) referred to the 'Los Angeles variant' as
Duarte-1 (D1), and noted that the N314D substitution was associated with
a silent L218L substitution. They found the same substitution, N314D, in
conjunction with 2 regulatory intronic mutations, 1105G-C and 1391G-A,
in the D2 variant. Although D1 and D2 have identical electrophoretic
mobility and isoelectric focusing points, their GALT activities differ:
D1 variants show 110% to 130% of normal RBC activity, but D2 variants
show only 40% to 50%. The N314D polymorphism occurs in both variants.
Podskarbi et al. (1996) suggested that the decrease in GALT activity in
D2 may be due to regulation of GALT gene expression by the intronic
mutations. They suggested that the 1105G-C site may be critical to the
function of erythroid transcription factor NFE1 (305371), since it
flanks the core consensus sequence for 1 of its binding sites.
Alternatively, both intronic mutations may be involved in aberrant
splice processing, possibly resulting in a low level of correctly
spliced mRNA.

Langley et al. (1997) evaluated GALT enzyme activity and screened the
GALT genes of 145 patients with 1 or more N314D-containing alleles. They
found 7 with the 'LA' biochemical phenotype, and all had the The 652C-T
transition in exon 7 in cis with the N314D substitution. In pedigree
analyses, this 652C-T transition segregated with the LA phenotype of
increased GALT activity in 3 different biochemical phenotypes: LA/N,
LA/G, and LA/D. From other studies, Langley et al. (1997) concluded that
the 652C-T transition increases GALT activity by increasing GALT protein
abundance without increasing transcription or decreasing thermolability.
They postulated a favorable codon bias for the mutated codon with
consequently increased translation rates.

Kozak et al. (1999) found that the Duarte allele is linked to a 4-bp
deletion 5-prime to the translation start site (-119_-116delGTCA;
606999.0016) of GALT. Elsas et al. (2001) found that this 4-bp deletion
conferred reduced lucerifase activity when transfected into cell lines.
Additionally, human lymphoblasts derived from patients with the Duarte
allele had reduced GALT mRNA. In the Los Angeles variant, the promoter
is intact. Trbusek et al. (2001) presented evidence that the 4-bp
promoter deletion is a crucial factor in reduction of Duarte allele
enzyme activity.

Carney et al. (2009) reported that the N314D protein was functionally
neutral in mammalian cell and yeast expression studies. In contrast, the
5-prime 4-bp deletion characteristic of D2 alleles appeared to be
functionally impaired in reporter gene transfection studies.
Allele-specific quantitative RT-PCR revealed that D2 alleles expressed
less mRNA in vivo than their wildtype counterparts. The 4-bp deletion
appeared to be exclusive to D2 alleles amongst GG, NN, and DG
populations. Carney et al. (2009) concluded that the 4-bp 5-prime
deletion is the causal mutation in Duarte galactosemia and suggested
that direct tests for this deletion could enhance or supplant current
tests.

.0006
GALACTOSEMIA
GALT, GLN188ARG

Reichardt et al. (1991) demonstrated a transition at nucleotide 591 that
substituted arginine for glutamine-188 (Q188R). The mutated glutamine is
not only highly conserved in evolution, but is also 2 amino acid
residues downstream from the active site histidine-proline-histidine
triad and results in about 10% of normal enzymatic activity. The Q188R
mutation was the most frequent galactosemia mutation characterized to
1991; it accounted for one-fourth of the galactosemia alleles studied.
Elsas et al. (1994) stated that the Q188R mutation accounts for
approximately 70% of Caucasian galactosemia (230400) in the state of
Georgia (USA) where classic galactosemia has an incidence of 1/38,886
(as determined in 1,396,766 liveborn infants).

Although the Q188R mutation is prevalent in the United States, Ashino et
al. (1995) found no example in Japanese patients.

Elsevier and Fridovich-Keil (1996) applied a yeast coexpression system
for GALT to investigate the impact of naturally occurring mutations on
subunit association of this dimeric enzyme and holoenzyme function. They
described the purification and characterization of 2 heterodimers,
R333W/wildtype (see 606999.0002) and Q188R/wildtype, revealing that
although the first exhibits approximately 50% wildtype activity, the
second exhibits only approximately 15% wildtype activity. Neither
heterodimer varied significantly from the wildtype with regard to
apparent Km for either substrate used, although Q188R/WT but not
R333W/WT heterodimers demonstrated significantly increased thermal
sensitivity relative to the wildtype enzyme. Elsevier and Fridovich-Keil
(1996) commented that their results demonstrated for the first time a
partial dominant-negative effect caused by a naturally occurring
mutation in human GALT.

GALACTOSEMIA
GALT, LEU74PRO

Reichardt et al. (1992) characterized 2 galactosemia (230400) mutations,
L74P and F171S (606999.0008), and 1 polymorphism, S135L, in the GALT
gene. Both mutations resulted in reduced enzymatic activity on
expression studies, whereas the polymorphism resulted in near normal
activity. Both mutations involved evolutionarily conserved residues,
while the polymorphism occurred in a nonconserved domain.

GALACTOSEMIA
GALT, HIS319GLN

Flach et al. (1990) identified a H319Q mutation in the GALT gene by
sequencing PCR-amplified DNA from an Italian galactosemia (230400)
patient. The mutation was a C-to-A transversion at basepair 985.
Reichardt et al. (1993) demonstrated that the H319Q allele encodes an
unstable polypeptide. This is a CRM-negative mutation that affects a
domain conserved in E. coli and yeast. Therefore, histidine-319
presumably encodes a structurally important residue.

.0010
GALACTOSEMIA
GALT, SER135LEU

Baker et al. (1966) described black patients with classic galactosemia
(230400) who lacked GALT activity in their erythrocytes and yet were
able to oxidize a substantial amount of labeled galactose to CO2 in vivo
(Segal and Cuatrecasas, 1968). Liver and intestinal mucosa biopsy
specimens from these patients expressed about 10% of normal GALT
activity. This apparent tissue specificity of GALT enzyme expression was
labeled the 'Negro variant' of galactosemia. Lai et al. (1996)
demonstrated that the underlying mutation is a C-to-T transition at
bp1158 of the GALT gene that results in a serine-to-leucine substitution
at codon 135 (S135L). Population screening was performed using a
restriction enzyme assay; the mutation abolishes a TaqI recognition
site. The S135L mutation was not found in 84 white patients with
homozygous galactosemia or in 87 white control subjects without
galactosemia. One S135L allele was found out of the 100 GALT alleles in
50 black subjects; 16 out of 32 alleles in 16 galactosemic patients were
of the S135L type. In 1 patient with galactosemia, the S135L mutation
was maternal in origin; the patient had a black mother and a white
father.

GALACTOSEMIA
GALT, PRO183THR

Ninfali et al. (1996) described an 8-year-old boy with galactosemia
(230400) as well as necrotic muscle fibers and muscle hypotrophy. This
child was a compound heterozygote. One allele was a previously described
glu188-to-arg change (606999.0006). The other allele was a novel A-to-C
substitution at nucleotide position 1454 in exon 6, predicting a proline
to threonine change at position 183.

.0012
GALT POLYMORPHISM (LOS ANGELES, D1)
GALT, LEU218LEU AND ASN314ASP

Langley et al. (1997) noted that the homozygous Duarte phenotype
(230400) (N314D; 606999.0005) is usually associated with approximately
50% of normal GALT enzyme activity, but sometimes the Duarte biochemical
phenotype, as defined by a shift in its isozyme-banding pattern toward
the anode on isoelectric focusing, is associated with increased GALT
enzyme activity; this biochemical variant has been called the 'Los
Angeles (LA) variant' by Ng et al. (1973) and others and is also know as
Duarte-1 or D1.

Langley et al. (1997) evaluated GALT enzyme activity and screened the
GALT gene of 145 patients with 1 or more N314D-containing alleles. They
found 7 with the LA biochemical phenotype, and all had a 652C-T
transition in exon 7 in cis with the N314D substitution. The 652C-T
transition is a rare neutral polymorphism for leucine at amino acid 218
(L218L; dbSNP rs2070075). In pedigree analyses, the 652C-T transition
segregated with the LA phenotype of increased GALT activity. From other
studies, Langley et al. (1997) concluded that the codon change in 314D
in cis with the 652C-T transition produces the LA variant galactosemia
and that this nucleotide change increases GALT activity by increasing
GALT protein abundance without increasing transcription or decreasing
thermolability. They postulated a favorable codon bias for the mutated
codon with subsequently increased translation rates as the mechanism.

Carney et al. (2009) reported that the frequency of the TTA(Leu) codon
accounted for 4.5% of alleles in the CEPH HapMap sample, whereas the
frequency is even rarer in non-European populations, with an observed
frequency of about 1% in the Chinese sample and a complete absence in
the Yoruba and Japanese samples.

GALACTOSEMIA
GALT, LYS285ASN

In a study of 30 families with classic galactosemia (230400) in Denmark,
Greber-Platzer et al. (1997) found that the second common galactosemia
mutation was lys285 to gln (K285N), accounting for 28% of GALT gene
alleles.

GALACTOSEMIA
GALT, ARG333GLY

In Ireland, classic galactosemia (230400) is very frequent among the
Travellers, an endogamous nomadic group in which all cases are due to
homozygosity for the Q188R mutation (606999.0006). The same allele
accounts for most of the disease alleles among non-Travellers (89.1%).
Murphy et al. (1999) found that of the 5 non-Q188R mutant alleles in the
non-Traveller group, one was R333G and one was F194L (606999.0016), with
3 remaining uncharacterized.

GALACTOSEMIA, DUARTE VARIANT
GALT, 4-BP DEL, -119GTCA

Kozak et al. (1999) found that the Duarte allele (N314D; 606999.0005) is
linked to a 4-bp deletion, 5-prime to the translation start site
(-119_-116delGTCA) of GALT, resulting in disruption of predicted binding
sites of 2 transcriptional activators (AP1Q2 and AP1Q4). Elsas et al.
(2001) found that this 4-bp deletion conferred reduced lucerifase
activity when transfected into cell lines. Additionally, human
lymphoblasts derived from patients with the Duarte allele had reduced
GALT mRNA. In the Los Angeles variant (606999.0012), the promoter is
intact. Trbusek et al. (2001) presented evidence that the 4-bp promoter
deletion is a crucial factor in reduction of Duarte allele enzyme
activity.

Carney et al. (2009) reported that the N314D substitution was
functionally neutral in mammalian cell and yeast expression studies. In
contrast, the 5-prime 4-bp deletion characteristic of D2 alleles
appeared to be functionally impaired in reporter gene transfection
studies. Allele-specific quantitative RT-PCR revealed that D2 alleles
expressed less mRNA in vivo than their wildtype counterparts, suggesting
that underexpression at the mRNA level contributes to the compromised
function of the D2 GALT allele. The 4-bp deletion appeared to be
exclusive to D2 alleles amongst GG, NN, and DG populations. Carney et
al. (2009) concluded that the 4-bp 5-prime deletion is the causal
mutation in Duarte galactosemia and suggested that direct tests for this
deletion could enhance or supplant current tests.

601989	TITLE *601989 S100 CALCIUM-BINDING PROTEIN A13; S100A13
DESCRIPTION Wicki et al. (1996) reported the characterization of a human gene they
symbolized S100A13, a calcium-binding protein belonging to the S100
protein family. S100 proteins are small EF-hand calcium-binding proteins
of variable lengths and sequence identities. At least 12 of 15 members
of the family are clustered on chromosome 1q21 (see S100A1; 176940);
S100A13 likewise colocalizes with S100A1 on the 1q21 cluster. The
predicted 98 amino acid S100A13 protein shows sequence homologies to
other S100 proteins between 50.5% (S100A5; 176991) and 59.3% (S100A12;
603112). Northern blot analysis showed high amounts of S100A13 mRNA in
adult skeletal muscle, heart, kidney, ovary, spleen, small intestine,
and pancreas and in fetal lung, heart, cochlea, liver, spleen, and
parathyroid tumor cells. Moderate levels were detected in all other
tissues examined, with the exception of placenta and leukocytes, which
had very low or undetectable levels. Wicki et al. (1996) also cloned the
mouse S100A13 gene. Mouse S100A13 is composed of 98 amino acids and
displays 86.7% homology compared to human S100A13.

605228	TITLE *605228 COREPRESSOR INTERACTING WITH RBPJ, 1; CIR1
;;CBF1-INTERACTING COREPRESSOR; CIR
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

CBF1 (RBPJ; 147183) is a member of the CSL (CBF1, 'suppressor of
hairless,' and Lag1) family of DNA-binding factors, which mediate
transcriptional activation or repression. The Epstein-Barr
virus-immortalizing protein EBNA2 activates both cellular and viral gene
expression by targeting CBF1 and mimicking the NOTCH1 (190198)
intracellular domain (NICD). Both NICD and EBNA2 bind to the repression
domain of CBF1 and abolish repression activity. Using a yeast 2-hybrid
screen of a B-cell cDNA library with CBF1 as bait, Hsieh et al. (1999)
isolated a cDNA encoding CIR. The predicted 450-amino acid CIR protein
contains a highly charged, serine-rich C terminus. Northern blot
analysis revealed widespread expression of CIR, with strongest
expression in heart, skeletal muscle, and pancreas. Immunofluorescence
analysis showed that CIR is a nuclear protein like CBF1, although CIR
did not bind to nucleolus.

GENE FUNCTION

Hsieh et al. (1999) found that the N-terminal 121 amino acids of CIR
interacted with amino acids 233 to 249 of CBF1 and repressed
transcriptional activity. Yeast 2-hybrid and immunofluorescence analyses
showed that CIR also interacted with HDAC2 (605164) and SAP30 (603378),
important mediators of transcriptional repression.

MAPPING

Gross (2012) mapped the CIR1 gene to chromosome 2q31.1 based on an
alignment of the CIR1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF098297) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

;;B-CELL MATURATION FACTOR; BCMA; BCM
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Laabi et al. (1992) found that a t(4;16)(q26;p13.1) translocation, found
in tumor cells of a patient with intestinal T-cell lymphoma, resulted in
a rearrangement of the interleukin-2 gene (IL2; 147680), normally
located on 4q26, with sequences from 16p13.1. Use of an IL2-specific
probe to screen a cDNA library of tumor cells, Laabi et al. (1992)
isolated clones that consisted, from 5-prime to 3-prime, of the 3 first
exons of the IL2 gene, followed by a 16p13 in-frame sequence encoding
181 amino acids. A probe derived from this sequence detected a 1.2-kb
transcript in various cell lines exhibiting mature B lymphoid cell
features, but this sequence was not detected in other cell lines
representative of other hematopoietic lineages, or in other organs. For
this reason, the novel gene was termed BCM for B-cell maturation. The
open reading frame of normal BCM cDNA predicted a 184-amino acid protein
with a single transmembrane domain that had no homology with any protein
sequences stored in data banks. Data indicated that the expression of
BCM coincides with B-cell terminal maturation.

GENE FUNCTION

Using an expression cloning approach, Gross et al. (2000) identified
BAFF (603969) as a ligand for BCMA.

Gras et al. (1995) found that in a myeloma cell line, BCMA is primarily
expressed in a perinuclear Golgi-like structure. By transfection of
kidney and B-cell lines and flow cytometry and immunofluorescence
analysis, Hatzoglou et al. (2000) demonstrated that in addition to the
intracytoplasmic localization, BCMA is present on the cell surface.
Western blot analysis showed that overexpressed BCMA, like other TNFRs,
induces activation of NFKB (164011) as well as the MAPK substrate ELK1
(311040) and the MAPKs JNK (MAPK8; 601158) and p38 (MAPK14; 600289), but
not ERK (600997), via its cytoplasmic tail (residues 119 to 143).
Cotransfection, immunoprecipitation, and immunoblot analysis indicated
that BCMA, again through its cytoplasmic tail, associates with TRAF1
601711, TRAF2 601895, and TRAF3 601896, but not with TRAF5 602356,
suggesting that these adaptor proteins further propagate signals
elicited by TNFRs such as BCMA.

CYTOGENETICS

The patient from whose tumor cells the 4;16 translocation was derived
(Laabi et al., 1992) had a chronic intestinal malabsorption syndrome.
Histologic and immunohistochemical studies demonstrated a
lymphoproliferative syndrome of mature T cells. Monoclonality was
demonstrated by the presence of a rearranged band of the TCRB gene (see
186930).

611946	TITLE *611946 UBX DOMAIN PROTEIN 6; UBXN6
;;UBX DOMAIN-CONTAINING GENE 1; UBXD1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database analysis, Carim-Todd et al. (2001) identified UBXD1. They
isolated 2 transcripts encoding predicting proteins of 388 and 441 amino
acids with calculated molecular masses of 43.8 and 49.7 kD,
respectively. UBXD1 contains a C-terminal UBX domain, characteristic of
ubiquitin regulatory proteins, and shares 80% and 79% amino acid
identity with the mouse and rat homologs, respectively. Northern blot
analysis of adult human tissues detected 1.6-, 1.8-, and 5.5-kb
transcripts with highest expression in testis, followed by prostate,
spleen, thymus, small intestine, colon, blood leukocytes, and uterus.

GENE STRUCTURE

Carim-Todd et al. (2001) determined that the UBXD1 gene contains 11
exons with an alternatively spliced exon 1a. The 1.8-kb transcript
contains an in-frame stop codon in exon 1a preceding a second open
reading frame and results in the shorter isoform.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Carim-Todd et al. (2001) mapped the UBXD1
gene to chromosome 19p13.

;;ONCOGENE MYC;;

PROTOONCOGENE HOMOLOGOUS TO MYELOCYTOMATOSIS VIRUS
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The MYC protooncogene encodes a DNA-binding factor that can activate and
repress transcription. Via this mechanism, MYC regulates expression of
numerous target genes that control key cellular functions, including
cell growth and cell cycle progression. MYC also has a critical role in
DNA replication. Deregulated MYC expression resulting from various types
of genetic alterations leads to constitutive MYC activity in a variety
of cancers and promotes oncogenesis (Dominguez-Sola et al., 2007).

CLONING

Persson and Leder (1984) showed that the product of the MYC gene has a
molecular mass of 65 kD, is located predominantly in the nucleus, and
binds to DNA.

MAPPING

Leder (1982) described in situ hybridization observations suggesting
that the MYC gene is on chromosome 8 near 8q24, the breakpoint in
Burkitt lymphoma (113970) translocations.

By the Southern blotting technique applied to somatic cell hybrids,
Dalla-Favera et al. (1982) showed that the MYC gene is on chromosome 8.
When hybrids between rodent cells and human Burkitt lymphoma (113970)
cells were analyzed, Dalla-Favera et al. (1982) could show that the MYC
gene is on the part of chromosome 8 (8q24-qter) that is translocated to
2, 14, or 22. Several MYC-related sequences may be pseudogenes. Taub et
al. (1982) also mapped the MYC gene to chromosome 8q24.

By fluorescence in situ hybridization in combination with R banding,
Takahashi et al. (1991) refined the assignment of MYC to chromosome
8q24.12-q24.13, distal to fragile site fra(8)(q24.11).

GENE FUNCTION

Cell proliferation is regulated by the induction of growth promoting
genes and the suppression of growth inhibitory genes. Malignant growth
can result from the altered balance of expression of these genes in
favor of cell proliferation. Induction of the transcription factor MYC
promotes cell proliferation and transformation by activating
growth-promoting genes, including the ornithine decarboxylase (ODC1;
165640) and CDC25A (116947) genes. Lee et al. (1997) showed that MYC
transcriptionally represses the expression of the growth arrest gene
(GAS1; 139185). A conserved MYC structure, MYC box 2, is required for
repression of GAS1 and for MYC induction of proliferation and
transformation, but not for activation of ODC1.

The MYC protein activates transcription as part of a heteromeric complex
with MAX (154950). However, cells transformed by MYC are characterized
by the loss of expression of numerous genes, suggesting that MYC may
also repress gene expression. By searching for proteins that may mediate
gene repression by MYC, Peukert et al. (1997) identified ZNF151
(604084), which they called MIZ1 for 'MYC-interacting zinc finger
protein-1.' MIZ1 interacts specifically with the helix-loop-helix domain
of MYC and NMYC. The predicted MIZ1 protein contains a POZ (poxvirus and
zinc finger) domain, which appears to act as a negative regulatory
domain for transcription factor function, and 13 zinc finger domains.
MIZ1 has a potent growth arrest function and can bind to and
transactivate the adenovirus major late and cyclin D1 (CCND1; 168461)
promoters. Interaction between MIZ1 and MYC overcomes MIZ1-induced
growth arrest, inhibits MIZ1 transactivation, induces MIZ1 nuclear
sequestration, and renders MIZ1 insoluble in vivo. These effects depend
on the integrity of the POZ domain of MIZ1. Peukert et al. (1997)
suggested that MYC inhibits gene transcription by activating the latent
inhibitory functions of the MIZ1 POZ domain.

Grandori et al. (1996) identified DDX18 (606355) as a direct in vivo
target of Myc and Max and hypothesized that Myc may exert its effects on
cell behavior through proteins that affect RNA structure and metabolism.

He et al. (1998) provided a molecular framework for understanding the
previously enigmatic overexpression of MYC in colorectal cancers.
Inactivating mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli gene (APC;
611731), found in most colorectal cancers, cause aberrant accumulation
of beta-catenin (CTNNB1; 116806), which then binds T-cell factor 4
(TCF4; 602228), causing increased transcriptional activation of unknown
genes. He et al. (1998) showed that the MYC oncogene is a target in this
signaling pathway. They showed that expression of MYC is repressed by
wildtype APC and activated by beta-catenin, and that effects are
mediated through TCF4 binding sites in the MYC promoter.

Wu et al. (1999) demonstrated that the MYC protein represses the
expression of ferritin-H (134770), which sequesters intracellular iron,
and stimulates the expression of iron regulatory protein-2 (IRP2;
147582), which increases the intracellular iron pool. Downregulation of
ferritin-H expression was required for cell transformation by c-myc. Wu
et al. (1999) further demonstrated that the downregulation of ferritin-H
expression was independent of c-myc-induced changes in cell cycle
activity. The authors concluded that this function for c-myc is
consistent with observations that iron chelation leads to growth arrest.

Wu et al. (1999) demonstrated direct activation of telomerase by MYC.
Telomerase is the ribonuclear protein complex expressed in proliferating
and transformed cells, in which it preserves chromosomal integrity by
maintaining telomere length. MYC activates telomerase by inducing
expression of its catalytic subunit, telomerase-reverse transcriptase
(TERT; 187270). Telomerase complex activity is dependent on TERT, a
specialized type of reverse transcriptase. Wu et al. (1999) showed that
TERT is a target of MYC activity and identified a pathway linking cell
proliferation and chromosome integrity in normal and neoplastic cells.

Wang et al. (2000) demonstrated that TERT-driven cell proliferation is
not genoprotective because it is associated with activation of the MYC
oncogene. Human mammary epithelial cells, which normally stop dividing
in culture at 55 to 60 population doublings (PDs), were infected with
human TERT retrovirus at PD40 and maintained until PD250. Wang et al.
(2000) then tested whether telomerase activity was essential for the
immortalized phenotype by excising the TERT retrovirus at PD150 using
Cre recombinase. The resulting cells were maintained for at least
another 20 population doublings, and no decline in growth rates in
either pooled cells or individual clones was observed. Ectopic
expression of MYC was found to be upregulated between 107 and 135
population doublings. Wang et al. (2000) suggested that under standard
culture conditions, extension of life span by telomerase selects for MYC
overexpression in human mammary epithelial cells.

Ma et al. (2000) analyzed the murine c-Myc promoter response to
glucocorticoid and identified a novel glucocorticoid response element
that does not conform to the consensus glucocorticoid receptor-binding
sequence. Glucocorticoids activated c-Myc/reporter constructs that
contained this element. Deletion of these sequences from the c-Myc
promoter increased basal activity of the promoter and blocked
glucocorticoid induction. Footprinting analysis suggested that a
cellular repressor also binds to this element. Ma et al. (2000)
concluded that the glucocorticoid receptor binds to the c-Myc promoter
in competition with this protein, which is a repressor of transcription.

MYC induces transcription of the E2F1 (189971), E2F2 (600426), and E2F3
(600427) genes. Using primary mouse embryo fibroblasts deleted for
individual E2f genes, Leone et al. (2001) showed that MYC-induced S
phase and apoptosis requires distinct E2F activities. The ability of Myc
to induce S phase was impaired in the absence of either E2f2 or E2f3 but
not E2f1 or E2f4 (600659). In contrast, the ability of Myc to induce
apoptosis was markedly reduced in cells deleted for E2f1 but not E2f2 or
E2f3. The authors proposed that the induction of specific E2F activities
is an essential component in the MYC pathways that control cell
proliferation and cell fate decisions.

Feng et al. (2002) showed that MYC physically interacts with SMAD2
(601366) and SMAD3 (603109), 2 specific signal transducers involved in
TGF-beta (190180) signaling. Through its direct interaction with SMADs,
MYC binds to the SP1 (189906)-SMAD complex on the promoter of the
p15(INK4B) gene (600431), thereby inhibiting the TGF-beta-induced
transcriptional activity of SP1 and SMAD/SP1-dependent transcription of
the p15(INK4B) gene. The oncogenic MYC promotes cell growth and cancer
development partly by inhibiting the growth inhibitory functions of
SMADs.

To identify target genes of MYC, Menssen and Hermeking (2002) performed
serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) after adenoviral expression of
MYC in primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Induction of 53
genes was confirmed using microarray analysis and quantitative RT-PCR.
Among these genes was MetAP2, also called p67 (601870), which encodes an
activator of translational initiation and represents a validated target
for inhibition of neovascularization. Furthermore, MYC induced 3 cell
cycle regulatory genes and 3 DNA repair genes, suggesting that MYC
couples DNA replication to processes preserving the integrity of the
genome. MNT (603039), a MAX-binding antagonist of MYC function, was
upregulated, implying a negative feedback loop. In vivo promoter
occupancy by MYC was detected by chromatin immunoprecipitation for at
least 5 genes, showing that they are direct MYC targets. The authors
suggested that the MYC-regulated genes identified by this study define a
set of bona fide MYC targets and may have potential therapeutic value
for inhibition of cancer cell proliferation, tumor vascularization, and
restenosis.

Leven (2002) discussed and diagrammed the complex web of MYC-related
pathways involved in growth, proliferation, and apoptosis.

Vafa et al. (2002) showed that brief MYC activation can induce DNA
damage prior to S phase in normal human fibroblasts. Damage correlated
with induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) without induction of
apoptosis. Deregulated MYC partially disabled the p53 (191170)-mediated
DNA damage response, enabling cells with damaged genomes to enter the
cycle, resulting in poor clonogenic survival. An antioxidant reduced
ROS, decreased DNA damage and p53 activation, and improved survival. The
authors proposed that oncogene activation can induce DNA damage and
override damage controls, thereby accelerating tumor progression via
genetic instability.

Activation of the tumor suppressor p53 by DNA damage induces either cell
cycle arrest or apoptotic cell death. Seoane et al. (2002) demonstrated
that MYC is a principal determinant of this choice. MYC is directly
recruited to the p21(CIP1) (116899) promoter by the DNA-binding protein
MIZ1 (604084). This interaction blocks p21(CIP1) induction by p53 and
other activators. As a result MYC switches, from cytostatic to
apoptotic, the p53-dependent response of colon cancer cells to DNA
damage. MYC does not modify the ability of p53 to bind to the p21(CIP1)
or PUMA (605854) promoters, but selectively inhibits bound p53 from
activating p21(CIP1) transcription. By inhibiting p21(CIP1) expression
MYC favors the initiation of apoptosis, thereby influencing the outcome
of a p53 response in favor of cell death.

Herold et al. (2002) showed that transactivation by MIZ1 is negatively
regulated by association with topoisomerase II-binding protein (TOPBP1;
607760). Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation downregulated expression of TOPBP1
and released MIZ1. MIZ1 bound to the p21CIP1 core promoter in vivo and
was required for upregulation of p21CIP1 upon UV irradiation. Using both
Myc -/- cells and a point mutant of MYC that is deficient in
MIZ1-dependent repression, Herold et al. (2002) showed that MYC
negatively regulates transcription of p21CIP1 upon UV irradiation and
facilitates recovery from UV-induced cell cycle arrest through binding
to MIZ1.

Gomez-Roman et al. (2003) demonstrated that c-MYC binds to transcription
factor IIIB (see 604902), an RNA polymerase III (pol III)-specific
general transcription factor, and directly activates pol III
transcription. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed that endogenous
c-MYC is present at tRNA and 5S rRNA genes in cultured mammalian cells.
Gomez-Roman et al. (2003) concluded that activation of pol III may have
a role in the ability of c-MYC to stimulate cell growth.

In mouse embryo fibroblasts, Qi et al. (2004) showed that p19(Arf)
(CDKN2A; 600160) can inhibit c-Myc by a unique and direct mechanism that
is independent of p53 (191170). When c-Myc increased, p19(Arf) bound
with c-Myc and dramatically blocked c-Myc's ability to activate
transcription and induce hyperproliferation and transformation. In
contrast, c-Myc's ability to repress transcription was unaffected by
p19(Arf), and c-Myc-mediated apoptosis was enhanced. These differential
effects of p19(Arf) on c-Myc function suggested that separate molecular
mechanisms mediate c-Myc-induced hyperproliferation and apoptosis. This
direct feedback mechanism represents a p53-independent checkpoint to
prevent c-Myc-mediated tumorigenesis.

Hemann et al. (2005) reported that 2 common mutant MYC alleles derived
from human Burkitt lymphoma (113970) uncouple proliferation from
apoptosis and, as a result, are more effective than wildtype MYC at
promoting B-cell lymphomagenesis in mice. Mutant MYC proteins retain
their ability to stimulate proliferation and activate p53, but are
defective at promoting apoptosis due to a failure to induce the BH3-only
protein BIM (603827) and effectively inhibit BCL2 (151430). Disruption
of apoptosis through enforced expression of BCL2, or loss of either BIM
or p53 function, enables wildtype MYC to produce lymphomas as
efficiently as mutant MYC. Hemann et al. (2005) concluded that their
data show how parallel apoptotic pathways act together to suppress
MYC-induced transformation, and how mutant MYC proteins, by selectively
disabling a p53-independent pathway, enable tumor cells to evade p53
action during lymphomagenesis.

He et al. (2005) compared B-cell lymphoma samples and cell lines to
normal tissues, and found that the levels of the primary or mature
microRNAs derived from the miR17-92 locus (609416) within C13ORF25
(609415) were often substantially increased in the cancers. Enforced
expression of the miR17-92 cluster acted with c-Myc expression to
accelerate tumor development in a mouse B-cell lymphoma model. Tumors
derived from hematopoietic stem cells expressing a subset of the
miR17-92 cluster and c-Myc could be distinguished by an absence of
apoptosis that was otherwise prevalent in c-Myc-induced lymphomas. He et
al. (2005) concluded that noncoding RNAs, specifically microRNAs, can
modulate tumor formation, and implicated the miR17-92 cluster as a
potential human oncogene.

O'Donnell et al. (2005) showed that c-Myc activates expression of a
cluster of 6 miRNAs on human chromosome 13 (see 609415). Chromatin
immunoprecipitation experiments showed that c-Myc binds directly to this
locus. The transcription factor E2F1 (189971) is an additional target of
c-Myc that promotes cell cycle progression. O'Donnell et al. (2005)
found that expression of E2F1 is negatively regulated by 2 miRNAs in
this cluster, miR17-5p (609416) and miR20a (609420). O'Donnell et al.
(2005) concluded that their findings expand the known classes of
transcripts within the c-Myc target gene network, and reveal a mechanism
through which c-Myc simultaneously activates E2F1 transcription and
limits its translation, allowing a tightly controlled proliferative
signal.

Noubissi et al. (2006) demonstrated that CRDBP (608288) is essential for
the induction of both BTRCP1 (603482) and c-Myc by beta-catenin (see
116806) signaling in colorectal cancer cells. Noubissi et al. (2006)
concluded that high levels of CRDBP that are found in primary human
colorectal tumors exhibiting active beta-catenin/Tcf signaling
implicates CRDBP induction in the upregulation of BTRCP1, in the
activation of dimeric transcription factor NF-kappa-B (see 164011), and
in the suppression of apoptosis in these cancers.

By examining gene expression profiles, Palomero et al. (2006) found that
NOTCH (190198) and MYC regulate 2 interconnected transcriptional
programs containing common target genes that regulate cell growth in
primary human T-cell lymphoblastic leukemias.

Dominguez-Sola et al. (2007) showed that c-Myc has a direct role in the
control of DNA replication. c-Myc interacts with the prereplicative
complex and localizes to early sites of DNA synthesis. Depletion of
c-Myc from mammalian (human and mouse) cells as well as from Xenopus
cell-free extracts, which are devoid of RNA transcription, demonstrated
a nontranscriptional role for c-Myc in the initiation of DNA
replication. Dominguez-Sola et al. (2007) found that overexpression of
c-Myc caused increased replication origin activity with subsequent DNA
damage and checkpoint activation.

Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells can be generated from mouse
fibroblasts by retrovirus-mediated introduction of 4 transcription
factors, Oct3/4 (164177), Sox2 (184429), c-Myc, and Klf4 (602253), and
subsequent selection for Fbx15 (609093) expression (Takahashi and
Yamanaka, 2006). These iPS cells, hereafter called Fbx15 iPS cells, are
similar to embryonic stem (ES) cells in morphology, proliferation, and
teratoma formation; however, they are different with regard to gene
expression and DNA methylation patterns, and fail to produce adult
chimeras. Okita et al. (2007) showed that selection for Nanog (607937)
expression results in germline-competent iPS cells with increased ES
cell-like gene expression and DNA methylation patterns compared with
Fbx15 iPS cells. The 4 transgenes were strongly silenced in Nanog iPS
cells. Okita et al. (2007) obtained adult chimeras from 7 Nanog iPS cell
clones, with one clone being transmitted through the germline to the
next generation. Approximately 20% of the offspring developed tumors
attributable to reactivation of the c-Myc transgene. Okita et al. (2007)
concluded that iPS cells competent for germline chimeras can be obtained
from fibroblasts, but retroviral introduction of c-Myc should be avoided
for clinical application.

Wernig et al. (2007) independently demonstrated that the transcription
factors Oct4, Sox2, c-Myc, and Klf4 can induce epigenetic reprogramming
of a somatic genome to an embryonic pluripotent state.

Using Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and Myc, Park et al. (2008) derived iPS cells
from fetal, neonatal, and adult human primary cells, including dermal
fibroblasts isolated from a skin biopsy of a healthy research subject.
Human iPS cells resemble embryonic stem cells in morphology and gene
expression and in the capacity to form teratomas in immune-deficient
mice. Park et al. (2008) concluded that defined factors can reprogram
human cells to pluripotency, and they established a method whereby
patient-specific cells might be established in culture.

Kim et al. (2008) showed that adult mouse neural stem cells express
higher endogenous levels of Sox2 and c-Myc than embryonic stem cells and
that exogenous Oct4 together with either Klf4 (602253) or c-Myc is
sufficient to generate induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells from neural
stem cells. These 2-factor iPS cells are similar to embryonic stem cells
at the molecular level, contribute to development of the germ line, and
form chimeras. Kim et al. (2008) proposed that, in inducing
pluripotency, the number of reprogramming factors can be reduced when
using somatic cells that endogenously express appropriate levels of
complementing factors.

Stadtfeld et al. (2008) generated mouse iPS cells from fibroblasts and
liver cells by using nonintegrating adenoviruses transiently expressing
Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc. These adenoviral iPS cells showed DNA
demethylation characteristic of reprogrammed cells, expressed endogenous
pluripotency genes, formed teratomas, and contributed to multiple
tissues, including the germ cell line, in chimeric mice. Stadtfeld et
al. (2008) concluded that their results provided strong evidence that
insertional mutagenesis is not required for in vitro reprogramming.

Okita et al. (2008) independently reported the generation of mouse iPS
cells without viral vectors. Repeated transfection of 2 expression
plasmids, one containing the cDNAs of Oct3/4, Sox2, and Klf4 and the
other containing the c-Myc cDNA, into mouse embryonic fibroblasts
resulted in iPS cells without evidence of plasmid integration, which
produced teratomas when transplanted into mice and contributed to adult
chimeras. Okita et al. (2008) concluded that the production of
virus-free iPS cells, albeit from embryonic fibroblasts, addresses a
critical safety concern for potential use of iPS cells in regenerative
medicine.

Hanna et al. (2009) demonstrated that the reprogramming by Oct4, Sox2,
Klf4, and Myc transcription factors is a continuous stochastic process
where almost all mouse donor cells eventually give rise to iPS cells on
continued growth and transcription factor expression. Additional
inhibition of the p53 (191170)/p21 (116899) pathway or overexpression of
Lin28 (611043) increased the cell division rate and resulted in an
accelerated kinetics of iPS cell formation that was directly
proportional to the increase in cell proliferation. In contrast, Nanog
overexpression accelerated reprogramming in a predominantly cell
division rate-independent manner. Quantitative analyses defined distinct
cell division rate-dependent and -independent modes for accelerating the
stochastic course of reprogramming, and suggested that the number of
cell divisions is a key parameter driving epigenetic reprogramming to
pluripotency.

Sotelo et al. (2010) identified a highly conserved enhancer element,
designated enhancer E, over 340 kb telomeric to the MYC gene. Reporter
gene assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that
beta-catenin/TCF4 interacted with enhancer E and activated expression of
a MYC reporter. Chromosome conformation capture assays suggested
formation of long-range DNA looping between the enhancer and the MYC
promoter.

By screening for short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) that altered the fitness of
mammary epithelial cells only in the presence of aberrant MYC, Kessler
et al. (2012) identified the SUMO-activating enzymes SAE1 (613294) and
SAE2 (UBA2; 613295) as MYC-synthetic lethal genes. Inactivation of SAE2
led to mitotic catastrophe and cell death upon MYC hyperactivation. SAE2
inhibition switched a MYC transcriptional subprogram from activated to
repressed. A subset of sumoylation-dependent MYC switchers (SMS genes),
including CASC5 (609173), BARD1 (601593), and CDC20 (603618), was
required for mitotic spindle function and to support the MYC oncogenic
program. Sae2 was required for growth of Myc-dependent tumors in mice.
Transduction of MYC-dependent breast cancer cells with inducible SAE2
shRNA suggested that SAE2 was required for growth and fitness of these
cell lines. Gene expression analysis of human breast cancers with
hyperactive MYC suggested that low expression of SAE1 and SAE2 resulted
in better metastasis-free survival. Kessler et al. (2012) proposed that
altering distinct subprograms of MYC transcription, such as by SAE2
inactivation, may be a therapeutic strategy in MYC-driven cancers.

Claveria et al. (2013) established a method for inducing functional
genetic mosiacs in the mouse. Using the system, the authors showed that
induction of a mosaic imbalance of Myc expression in the epiblast
provokes the expansion of cells with higher Myc levels through the
apoptotic elimination of cells with lower levels, without disrupting
development. In contrast, homogeneous shifts in Myc levels did not
affect epiblast cell viability, indicating that the observed competition
results from comparison of relative Myc levels between epiblast cells.
Claveria et al. (2013) found that during normal development, Myc levels
are intrinsically heterogeneous among epiblast cells, and that
endogenous cell competition refines the epiblast cell population through
the elimination of cells with low relative Myc levels. Claveria et al.
(2013) concluded that natural cell competition in the early mammalian
embryo contributes to the selection of the epiblast cell pool.

- MYC Alterations in Cancer

Collins and Groudine (1982) found that the normal human homolog of the
avian myc oncogene was present in multiple copies in the DNA of a
malignant promyelocyte cell line derived from the peripheral blood of a
patient with acute promyelocytic leukemia. Other human oncogenes were
not amplified.

Yokota et al. (1986) concluded that alterations are found in oncogenes
MYC, HRAS, or MYB in more than one-third of human solid tumors.
Amplification of MYC was found in advanced widespread tumors and in
aggressive primary tumors. Apparent allelic deletions of HRAS and MYB
could be correlated with progression and metastasis of carcinomas and
sarcomas.

Morse et al. (1988) found rearrangement of MYC in a breast carcinoma due
to insertion of a LINE-1 element.

Specific types of human papillomavirus (HPV), mostly HPV type 16 (HPV16)
and type 18 (HPV18), are associated with genital carcinomas such as
those of the cervix and their noninvasive precursors (167959, 167960).
In intraepithelial neoplasia, HPV DNA is detected most commonly as
episomal molecules, whereas it is found integrated in the cell genome in
the majority of invasive carcinomas. By chromosomal in situ
hybridization experiments, Couturier et al. (1991) determined the
localization of integrated HPV16 or HPV18 genomes in genital cancers. In
3 cancers, HPV sequences were located in band 8q24.1, which contains the
MYC gene, and in 1 cancer, HPV sequences were located in band 2p24,
which contains the NMYC gene (164840). In 3 of the 4 cases, the
protooncogene located near integrated viral sequences was found to be
structurally altered and/or overexpressed.

Ioannidis et al. (2003) found copy number gains encompassing the MYC
gene at chromosome 8q24 in 29 of 60 (48.3%) breast carcinomas examined.
A highly significant association was found between 8q24 copy number
gains and advanced tumor grade (grade I/II vs grade II, p of 0.006), and
a statistically significant association was observed with the mitotic
index score (1 or 2 vs 3, p of 0.038). Statistically significant higher
levels of MYC mRNA were observed only in samples showing 8q24 copy
number gains (p of 0.022).

Double minutes (dmin), the cytogenetic hallmark of genomic
amplification, are found in 1% of karyotypically abnormal acute myeloid
leukemias (AML; 601626) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). The MYC
gene is amplified in the majority of the cases and is generally assumed
to be the target gene. Storlazzi et al. (2004) studied 5 AML cases and 1
MDS case with MYC-containing dmin. Detailed FISH analyses identified a
common 4.3-Mb amplicon harboring 8 genes, including MYC and C8FW
(609461). The corresponding region was deleted in one of the chromosome
8 homologs in 5 of the 6 cases, suggesting that the dmin originated
through extra replication (or loop-formation)-excision-amplification.
Northern blot analysis revealed that MYC was not overexpressed. Instead,
the C8FW gene, encoding a phosphoprotein regulated by mitogenic
pathways, displayed increased expression. These results excluded MYC as
the target gene; the authors hypothesized that overexpression of C8FW
may be the functionally important consequence of 8q24 amplicons in AML
and MDS.

Heim and Mitelman (1987) counted a total of 83 bands that have been
found to be specifically involved in primary structural chromosome
rearrangements in human cancer. They compared the distribution of these
breakpoints with the chromosomal sites of 26 cellular oncogenes,
including MYC, which had to that time been mapped to individual bands in
the human genome. Nineteen of the 26 oncogenes were located in
cancer-associated bands. This clustering is statistically significant (p
= 0.0000012). They pointed out that cancer may be inflated by errors of
karyotype interpretation. Furthermore, it appears that only 1 of the 2
breakpoints in cancer-specific translocations is the site of an
oncogene, so that the number of cancer-associated breakpoints that are
found to contain oncogenes should theoretically approach 50% of the
total. Mitelman (1985) provided a useful catalog of chromosome
aberrations in cancer. Duesberg (1987) suggested that cellular cancer
genes, such as MYC, are not activated oncogenes but rather the result of
rare truncations and illegitimate recombinations that alter the germline
configuration of cellular genes. See review by Cole (1986).

Barna et al. (2008) intercrossed Myc transgenic mice, in which Myc is
overexpressed in the B-cell compartment (termed E(mu)-Myc/+) with L24
(RPL24; 604180) heterozygous mice, which have overall decreased protein
synthesis. By lowering the threshold of protein production in L24
heterozygote mice, the increased protein synthesis rates and cell size
in the E(mu)-Myc heterozygote cells were restored to normal levels in
the compound heterozygote mice. This effect suppressed the oncogenic
potential of Myc in this context. Barna et al. (2008) concluded that the
ability of Myc to increase protein synthesis directly augments cell size
and is sufficient to accelerate cell cycle progression independently of
known cell cycle targets transcriptionally regulated by Myc. In
addition, when protein synthesis is restored to normal levels,
Myc-overexpressing precancerous cells are more efficiently eliminated by
programmed cell death. Barna et al. (2008) suggested that their findings
revealed a mechanism that links increases in general protein synthesis
rates downstream of an oncogenic signal to a specific molecular
impairment in the modality of translation initiation used to regulate
the expression of selective mRNAs. Barna et al. (2008) showed that an
aberrant increase in cap-dependent translation downstream of Myc
hyperactivation specifically impairs the translational switch to
internal ribosomal entry site (IRES)-dependent translation that is
required for accurate mitotic progression. Failure of this translational
switch results in reduced mitotic-specific expression of the endogenous
IRES-dependent form of Cdk11 (176873), which leads to cytokinesis
defects and is associated with increased centrosome numbers and genome
instability in E(mu)-Myc/+ mice. When accurate translational control is
reestablished in E(mu)-Myc/+ mice, genome instability is suppressed.

Altered glucose metabolism in cancer cells is termed the Warburg effect,
which describes the propensity of most cancer cells to take up glucose
avidly and convert it primarily to lactate, despite available oxygen.
Cancer cells also depend on continued mitochondrial function for
metabolism, specifically glutaminolysis that catabolizes glutamine to
generate ATP and lactate. Glutamine, which is highly transported into
proliferating cells, is a major source of energy and nitrogen for
biosynthesis, and a carbon substrate for anabolic processes in cancer
cells. Gao et al. (2009) reported that the c-Myc oncogenic transcription
factor, which is known to regulate microRNAs and stimulate cell
proliferation, transcriptionally represses miR23a (607962) and miR23b
(610723), resulting in greater expression of their target protein,
mitochondrial glutaminase (GLS; 138280), in human P-493 B lymphoma cells
and PC3 prostate cancer cells. This effect leads to upregulation of
glutamine catabolism. Glutaminase converts glutamine to glutamate, which
is further catabolized through the tricarboxylic acid cycle for the
production of ATP or serves as substrate for glutathione synthesis. Gao
et al. (2009) concluded that the unique means by which Myc regulates
glutaminase uncovers a previously unsuspected link between Myc
regulation of microRNAs, glutamine metabolism, and energy and reactive
oxygen species homeostasis.

Liu et al. (2012) showed in human and murine cell lines that oncogenic
levels of MYC established a dependence on AMP-related kinase-5 (ARK5;
608130) for maintaining metabolic homeostasis and for cell survival.
ARK5 is an upstream regulator of AMPK and limits protein synthesis via
the mTOR complex-1 (see 601231) signaling pathway. ARK5 also maintains
expression of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes and respiratory
capacity, which is required for efficient glutamine metabolism.
Inhibition of ARK5 leads to a collapse of cellular ATP levels in cells
expressing deregulated MYC, inducing multiple proapoptotic responses as
a secondary consequence. Depletion of ARK5 prolonged survival in
MYC-driven mouse models of hepatocellular carcinoma, demonstrating that
targeting cellular energy homeostasis is a valid therapeutic strategy to
eliminate tumor cells that express deregulated MYC.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Nair and Burley (2003) determined the x-ray structures of the
basic/helix-loop-helix/leucine zipper (bHLHZ) domains of MYC-MAX and MAD
(600021)-MAX heterodimers bound to their common DNA target, the enhancer
box (E box) hexanucleotide (5-prime-CACGTG-3-prime), at 1.9- and
2.0-angstrom resolution, respectively. E-box recognition by these 2
structurally similar transcription factor pairs determines whether a
cell will divide and proliferate (MYC-MAX) or differentiate and become
quiescent (MAD-MAX). Deregulation of MYC has been implicated in the
development of many human cancers, including Burkitt lymphoma (113970),
neuroblastomas, and small cell lung cancers. Both quasisymmetric
heterodimers resemble the symmetric MAX homodimer, albeit with marked
structural differences in the coiled-coil leucine zipper regions that
explain preferential homo- and heteromeric dimerization of these 3
evolutionarily related DNA-binding proteins. The MYC-MAX heterodimer,
but not its MAD-MAX counterpart, dimerizes to form a bivalent
heterotetramer, explaining how MYC can upregulate expression of genes
with promoters bearing widely separated E boxes.

CYTOGENETICS

- Translocations of MYC in Burkitt Lymphoma

Taub et al. (1982) found that in 2 Burkitt lymphoma (113970) cell lines,
MYC was translocated into a DNA restriction fragment that also encoded
the immunoglobulin mu chain gene (IGHM; 147020). In a mouse
plasmacytoma, the MYC gene was translocated into the immunoglobulin
alpha switch region.

Maguire et al. (1983) found that Burkitt and non-Burkitt lymphomas with
either an 8;14 or an 8;22 translocation expressed 2- to 5-fold more
MYC-specific RNA than B-cell lines without a translocation. Tumor cell
lines of American origin with a translocation of either type expressed
similar amounts of MYC-specific RNA. Tumor cell lines of African origin
contained slightly higher levels of MYC-specific RNA than American
lines, but the level did not correlate with absence or presence of
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). No MOS-related transcripts were found in these
tumors. In Burkitt lymphomas bearing the 8;14 translocation, the MYC
gene is translocated to a heavy chain switch recombination region (mu or
alpha). See Adams et al. (1983).

The 14q marker in Burkitt lymphoma was first found by Manolov and
Manolova (1972). Zech et al. (1976) showed that the extra chromosomal
material joined to the end of one chromosome 14 was derived from the
distal part of 8q. Bernheim et al. (1981) found either 2;8 or 8;22
translocation in about 10% of cases. The translocations separate the MYC
gene from its normal promoter and 5-prime regulatory machinery, and
place it under some regulatory element associated with the
immunoglobulin gene. By hybrid cell studies of mouse plasmacytoma cells
and Burkitt lymphoma cells, Nishikura et al. (1983) showed that cells
containing the MYC gene on a translocation chromosome expressed high
levels of human specific MYC transcripts, whereas hybrid cells
containing the untranslocated MYC gene on the normal chromosome did not
contain such MYC mRNA. Usually in t(8;14) translocations, the MYC gene
is translocated to 14q. When the break occurs between the MYC first and
second exons, both segments are transcriptionally active.

Croce et al. (1983) studied somatic cell hybrids between mouse myeloma
cells and a Burkitt lymphoma human cell line with a t(8;22) chromosome
translocation. The MYC gene was found to remain on chromosome 8q+; the
normal chromosome 8 remains transcriptionally silent. The lambda
constant region is translocated 3-prime to the MYC oncogene.

- Translocations of MYC in Other Cancers

Alitalo et al. (1983) found that the MYC gene, which is involved by
translocation in the generation of Burkitt lymphoma, was amplified,
resulting in homogeneously staining chromosomal regions (HSRs), in a
human neuroendocrine tumor cell line derived from a colon cancer. The
HSR resided on a distorted X chromosome; amplification of MYC had been
accompanied by translocation of the gene from its normal position on
chromosome 8q24.

Erikson et al. (1986) studied 2 T-cell leukemias with a t(8;14)(q24;q11)
chromosome translocation. In 1, rearrangement was detected in a region
immediately 3-prime to the MYC locus. In the second, the breakpoint in
the chromosome 14 occurred between genes for the variable and constant
regions of the T-cell receptor alpha chain (TCRA; see 186880). The
constant region locus had translocated to a region more than 38 kb
3-prime to the MYC gene, yet as was shown by the study of hybrids
between the human cells and mouse cells, only the hybrids carrying the
8q+ chromosome expressed MYC. Thus, deregulation of the MYC locus can
occur not only with translocation of the heavy chain locus or one or the
other light chain locus to chromosome 8 but also with translocation of
the TCRA locus.

Finger et al. (1986) found that in T-cell leukemias carrying a
t(8;14)(q24;q11) translocation the TCRA gene cluster was implicated with
translocation of a constant gene locus to a region 3-prime to the MYC
oncogene. Thus, in this T-cell neoplasia, a mechanism operates
comparable to that in B-cell neoplasms such as Burkitt lymphoma.

- Formation of Translocations

Roix et al. (2003) examined the question of why translocations between
chromosomes tend to recur at specific breakpoints in the genome. They
provided evidence that higher-order spatial genome organization is a
contributing factor in the formation of recurrent translocations. They
showed that MYC, BCL (168461), and immunoglobulin loci, which are
recurrently translocated in various B-cell lymphomas, are preferentially
positioned in close spatial proximity relative to each other in normal B
cells. Loci in spatial proximity are nonrandomly positioned toward the
interior of the nucleus in normal B cells. This locus proximity is the
consequence of higher-order genome structure rather than a property of
individual genes. The results suggested that the formation of specific
translocations in human lymphomas, and perhaps other tissues, is
determined in part by higher-order spatial organization of the genome.
Roix et al. (2003) first assessed the global nuclear organization of
translocation-prone genes by localizing them using fluorescence in situ
hybridization. The preferred positioning they found was statistically
distinct from a uniform random distribution. They then measured the
physical distance between MYC and its various translocation partners in
karyotypically normal cells and compared their physical proximity with
the clinically observed frequencies of translocation. They found that
MYC was separated from its 2 most frequent translocation partners, IgH
(see 147100) and IgL (147220), by 40.7% and 41.0% of the nuclear
diameter, respectively, whereas its separation from its rare
translocation partner, IgK (147200), was 47.1%. This last value was
similar to that observed for a negative control locus, TGFBR2 (190182),
which had never been reported to translocate with MYC; its mean
separation was 49.4% of the nuclear diameter.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Contrary to the previous belief that MYC is wildtype in both types of
tumors, Bhatia et al. (1993) found that 65% of 57 Burkitt lymphomas and
30% of 10 mouse plasmacytomas exhibited at least 1 amino acid
substitution (see, e.g., 190080.0001-190080.0004). These mutations were
apparently homozygous in all Burkitt lymphoma cell lines tested and in 2
tumor biopsies, implying that the mutations often occur before MYC/Ig
(see 147220) translocation. In the mouse plasmacytomas, only the mutant
myc allele was expressed, indicating a functional homozygosity with
occurrence of mutations at the translocation. Many of the observed
mutations were clustered in regions associated with transcriptional
activation and apoptosis, and in the Burkitt lymphomas, they frequently
occurred at sites of phosphorylation, suggesting that the mutations had
a pathogenetic role. Most of the mutations observed were clearly not
polymorphisms, for reasons in addition to the large number of different
mutations observed: 1) a high proportion were missense mutations; 2)
most tumors contained multiple mutations; and 3) each tumor had a unique
pattern of mutations.

In addition to immunoglobulin V genes, the 5-prime sequences of BCL6
(109565) and FAS (TNFRSF6; 134637) are mutated in normal germinal center
B lymphocytes. Genomic instability promotes tumorigenesis through
defective chromosome segregation and DNA mismatch repair inactivation.
By screening 18 loci for mutations, Pasqualucci et al. (2001) identified
changes in the germline sequences of PIM1 (164960), MYC, ARHH (602037),
and/or PAX5 (167414), in addition to BCL6, in a majority of diffuse
large-cell lymphomas (DLCLs; see 601889). No mutations in PIM1, MYC,
ARHH, and PAX5 were detected in germinal-center lymphocytes, naive B
cells, or B-cell malignancies other than DLCLs. MYC mutations, which
were found in 32% of DLCLs, were located downstream of the major P1/P2
promoters in exon 1 or downstream of the minor P3 promoter in exon 2.
FISH analysis indicated that hypermutation in these genes is not due to
chromosomal translocation, as seen in Burkitt lymphoma (113970).
Chromosomal translocation, however, may be an outcome of hypermutation.
Specific features of the hypermutation process, including the
predominance of single nucleotide substitutions with occasional
deletions or duplications, a preference for transitions over
transversions, and a specific motif targeting RGYW, were recognizable in
each of the hypermutated loci. Pasqualucci et al. (2001) proposed that
aberrant hypermutation of regulatory and coding sequences of genes that
do not represent physiologic targets may provide the basis for DLCL
pathogenesis and explain its phenotypic and clinical heterogeneity. This
hypermutation malfunction is unlikely to be due to defective DNA
mismatch repair and does not appear to involve activation-induced
deaminase (AICDA; 605257)

Sotelo et al. (2010) noted that dbSNP rs6983267, which is located within
enhancer E over 340 kb telomeric to MYC, is strongly associated with
susceptibility to colorectal cancer (CRCS2; 611469) and hereditary
prostate cancer (HPC10; 611100). The T allele of dbSNP rs6983267
consistently stimulated activity of a MYC reporter to a greater extent
than the G allele in both the presence and absence of beta-catenin/TCF4.
The effect of dbSNP rs6983267 was not large, but it was highly
reproducible, with p less than 0.0022.

EVOLUTION

Sequences of the MYC oncogene have been highly conserved throughout
evolution, from Drosophila to vertebrates (Shilo and Weinberg, 1981).

Atchley and Fitch (1995) described phylogenetic analyses for 45 MYC
protein sequences. A gene duplication early in vertebrate evolution
produced the c-myc lineage and another lineage that later gave rise to
the N- and L-myc lineages by another gene duplication. Evolutionary
divergence in the MYC gene family corresponded closely to the known
branching order of the major vertebrate groups. The closely related
dimerization partner protein MAX exhibited significantly less
variability than MYC. Atchley and Fitch (1995) suggested a reduced
variability in MAX stems from natural selection acting to preserve
dimerization capability with products of MYC and related genes.

ANIMAL MODEL

Trumpp et al. (2001) reported the generation of an allelic series of
mice in which Myc expression is incrementally reduced to zero.
Fibroblasts from these mice showed reduced proliferation, and after
complete loss of Myc function they exited the cell cycle. Trumpp et al.
(2001) showed that Myc activity is not needed for cellular growth but
does determine the percentage of activated T cells that reenter the cell
cycle. In vivo, reduction of Myc levels resulted in reduced body mass
owing to multiorgan hypoplasia, in contrast to Drosophila dmyc mutants,
which are smaller as a result of hypotrophy. Trumpp et al. (2001) found
that dmyc substitutes for Myc in fibroblasts, indicating they have
similar biologic activities. Trumpp et al. (2001) concluded that there
may be fundamental differences in the mechanisms by which mammals and
insects control body size, and proposed that in mammals MYC controls the
decision to divide or not to divide and thereby functions as a crucial
mediator of signals that determine organ and body size.

Baudino et al. (2002) stated that c-Myc-null mice die by embryonic day
10.5 with defects in growth and in cardiac and neural development. They
determined that the lethality of c Myc-null embryos is associated with
profound defects in vasculogenesis and primitive erythropoiesis, and
compromised differentiation and growth of yolk sac and embryonic stem
(ES) cells. Further, c-Myc expression was required for the expression of
Vegf 192240, angiopoietin-2 (601922), thrombospondin-1 (188060), and
angiopoietin-1 (601667), and expression of Vegf partially rescued the
lethal defects. ES cells from c-Myc-null animals were impaired in their
ability to form tumors in immune-compromised mice, and the small tumors
that sometimes developed were poorly vascularized. Baudino et al. (2002)
concluded that c-Myc is necessary for the angiogenic switch for the
progression and metastasis of tumors, and that c-Myc promotes cell
growth and transformation, as well as vascular and hematopoietic
development, by functioning as a master regulator of angiogenic factors.

To explore the role of MYC in carcinogenesis, Pelengaris et al. (2002)
developed a reversible transgenic mouse model of pancreatic beta-cell
oncogenesis using a switchable form of the MYC protein. Activation of
MYC in adult, mature beta cells induced uniform beta-cell proliferation
but was accompanied by overwhelming apoptosis that rapidly eroded
beta-cell mass. Thus, the oncogenic potential of MYC in beta cells was
masked by apoptosis. Upon suppression of MYC-induced beta-cell apoptosis
by coexpression of BCLXL (600039), MYC triggered rapid and uniform
progression into angiogenic, invasive tumors. Subsequent MYC
deactivation induced rapid regression associated with vascular
degeneration and beta-cell apoptosis. These data indicated that highly
complex neoplastic lesions can be both induced and maintained in vivo by
a simple combination of 2 interlocking molecular lesions.

Jain et al. (2002) used a conditional transgenic mouse model for
MYC-induced tumorigenesis to demonstrate that brief inactivation of MYC
results in the sustained regression of tumors and the differentiation of
osteogenic sarcoma cells into mature osteocytes. Subsequent reactivation
of MYC did not restore the cells' malignant properties but instead
induced apoptosis. Thus, Jain et al. (2002) concluded that brief MYC
inactivation appears to cause epigenetic changes in tumor cells that
render them insensitive to MYC-induced tumorigenesis. The authors raised
the possibility that transient inactivation of MYC may be an effective
therapy for certain cancers.

Langenau et al. (2003) described the induction of clonally derived T
cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia in transgenic zebrafish expressing
mouse c-Myc under the control of the zebrafish Rag2 promoter.
Visualization of leukemic cells expressing a chimeric transgene encoding
MYC fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) revealed that leukemias
arose in the thymus, spread locally into gill arches and retroorbital
soft tissue, and then disseminated into skeletal muscle and abdominal
organs. Leukemic cells homed back to the thymus in irradiated fish
transplanted with GFP-labeled leukemic lymphoblasts. This transgenic
model provided a platform for drug screens and genetic screens aimed at
identifying mutations that suppress or enhance c-MYC-induced
carcinogenesis.

Shachaf et al. (2004) generated transgenic mice that conditionally
overexpressed Myc in liver cells. Upon Myc activation, all transgenic
mice developed liver tumors and succumbed to invasive liver cancers. Myc
inactivation induced tumor regression and the differentiation of tumor
cells into normal liver cells. Their tumorigenic potential remained
dormant as long as Myc remained inactive; Myc reactivation immediately
restored their neoplastic properties.

Ruggero et al. (2004) generated transgenic mice that overexpressed
translation initiation factor-4E (EIF4E; 133440) and observed a marked
increase in tumorigenesis in the mice compared with their wildtype
littermates. When the transgenic mice were intercrossed with a strain
overexpressing Myc, the double-transgenic offspring developed lymphoma
at a markedly accelerated rate. In the double-transgenic B cells, the
ability of Myc to induce apoptosis was markedly reduced, and eif4e's
induction of cellular senescence in vivo in splenic B cells was
completely abrogated. Ruggero et al. (2004) concluded that EIF4E and MYC
cooperate in inducing B-cell lymphomagenesis.

The normal function of MYC includes roles in the development,
proliferation, and survival of lymphocytes. Refaeli et al. (2005) found
that certain Myc transgenes elicited a murine lymphoma similar to
Burkitt lymphoma. The lymphoma required cooperation between Myc and an
autoantigenic stimulus of B cells, as well as a breach of immune
tolerance. Refaeli et al. (2005) demonstrated that overexpression of Myc
itself accounted for the breach of tolerance, which they attributed to
the ability of Myc to serve as a surrogate for cytokines. Myc
overexpression resulted in activated B cells that produced copious
amounts of autoantibody and engendered immune complex disease in the
kidney in response to a normally tolerated transgenic autoantigen.

To elucidate the role MYC has in the intestine after APC (611731) loss,
Sansom et al. (2007) simultaneously deleted both Apc and Myc in the
adult murine small intestine. They showed that loss of Myc rescued the
phenotypes of perturbed differentiation, migration, proliferation, and
apoptosis, which occur on deletion of Apc. Remarkably, this rescue
occurred in the presence of high levels of nuclear beta-catenin. Array
analysis revealed that Myc is required for the majority of Wnt (see
164820) target gene activation following Apc loss. Sansom et al. (2007)
concluded that these data established MYC as the critical mediator of
the early stages of neoplasia following APC loss.

Goga et al. (2007) examined the effects of inhibition of CDK1 (116940)
in the context of different oncogenic signals. Cells transformed with
MYC, but not cells transformed by a panel of other activated oncogenes,
rapidly underwent apoptosis when treated with small-molecule CDK1
inhibitors. The inhibitor of apoptosis protein survivin (BIRC5; 603352),
a non-CDK target, was required for the survival of cells overexpressing
MYC. Inhibition of CDK1 rapidly downregulated survivin expression and
induced MYC-dependent apoptosis. CDK1 inhibitor treatment of
MYC-dependent mouse lymphoma and hepatoblastoma tumors decreased tumor
growth and prolonged their survival.

Soucek et al. (2008) used a dominant-interfering Myc mutant to determine
both the therapeutic impact and side effects of Myc inhibition in a
preclinical mouse model of Ras (see 190020)-induced lung adenocarcinoma.
They showed that Myc inhibition triggers rapid regression of incipient
and established lung tumors, defining an unexpected role for endogenous
Myc function in the maintenance of Ras-dependent tumors in vivo.
Systemic Myc inhibition also exerts profound effects on normal
regenerating tissues. However, these effects are well tolerated over
extended periods and rapidly and completely reversible. Soucek et al.
(2008) concluded that their data demonstrated the feasibility of
targeting Myc, a common downstream conduit for many oncogenic signals,
as an effective, efficient, and tumor-specific cancer therapy.

;;ASH2;;
DROSOPHILA ASH2-LIKE;;
DROSOPHILA ABSENT, SMALL, OR HOMEOTIC DISCS 2-LIKE;;
ASH2L1;;
ASH2L2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Drosophila ash2 ('absent, small, or homeotic discs-2') belongs to the
trithorax gene family (see 159555). The ash2 product positively
regulates expression of homeotic selector genes and is implicated in
early development and formation of various disc patterns in the fruit
fly. By sequence analysis of a 1.8-Mb fragment of human genomic DNA in
8p11.2, coupled with in silico gene trapping, Ikegawa et al. (1999)
identified a gene that is highly homologous to Drosophila ash2; they
named the human gene ash2-like (ASH2L). Ikegawa et al. (1999) isolated a
full-length ASH2L cDNA encoding a deduced 628-amino acid protein with
93.9% amino acid sequence identity to mouse Ash2l and 45.4% identity to
Drosophila ash2. ASH2L contains a predicted PHD zinc finger domain, a
putative bipartite nuclear localization signal, potential N-linked
glycosylation sites, and potential tyrosine kinase phosphorylation
sites. Northern blot analysis detected an approximately 2.6-kb ASH2L
transcript in human adult and fetal tissues. ASH2L was ubiquitously
expressed, but it was predominantly expressed in adult heart and testis
and fetal lung and liver, with barely detectable expression in adult
lung, liver, kidney, prostate, and peripheral leukocytes. Ikegawa et al.
(1999) suggested that ASH2L functions as a transcriptional regulator.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ikegawa et al. (1999) determined that the ASH2L gene spans more than 34
kb and contains 16 exons. Its transcription is oriented from telomere to
centromere.

GENE FUNCTION

Wysocka et al. (2003) purified proteins associated with HCF1 (300019)
and identified a human trithorax-related SET1 (611052)/ASH2 histone
methyltransferase (HMT) complex, the human homolog of S. cerevisiae
Set1. Wysocka et al. (2003) showed that, as in yeast, the
HCF1-associated human SET1/ASH2 HMT complex possesses histone H3-K4
methylation activity, which activates transcription. Furthermore, this
activity is blocked by premethylation of K9, a repressor of
transcription, indicating that there is crosstalk between K9 methylation
and K4 methylation by the SET1/ASH2 complex. The human SET1/ASH2 HMT
complex associates with the HCF1 Kelch domain, whereas Sin3 histone
deacetylase (HDAC) (see 607776 and 601241), a chromatin-associated
complex which represses transcription, associates with the basic region.
From subsequent cosedimentation and immunoprecipitation experiments,
Wysocka et al. (2003) found that the human SET1/ASH2 complex, in
mutually exclusive interactions, can associate with HCF1 bound to Sin3
HDAC or to HCF1 bound to VP16, indicating diverse transcriptional
regulatory roles.

607259	TITLE #607259 SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA 7, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE; SPG7
DESCRIPTION A number sign (#) is used with this entry because spastic paraplegia-7
is caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous mutation in the
paraplegin gene (SPG7; 602783) on chromosome 16q24. Some patients with
the disorder carry heterozygous SPG7 mutations.

DESCRIPTION

Hereditary spastic paraplegia (SPG) is characterized by progressive
weakness and spasticity of the lower limbs due to degeneration of
corticospinal axons. There is considerable genetic heterogeneity.
Inheritance is most often autosomal dominant (see 182600), but X-linked
(see 312920) and autosomal recessive (see 270800) forms occur.

SPG7 shows phenotypic variability between families. Some cases are pure,
whereas other are complicated with additional neurologic features
(Warnecke et al., 2007).

CLINICAL FEATURES

De Michele et al. (1998) reported a large consanguineous family with
autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia with age of onset between 25 and
42 years (mean 30 +/- 8 years). Abnormal gait was the presenting symptom
in all cases, and it was associated with leg pains in 1 patient.
Weakness and extensor plantar response were absent in 1 patient with the
shortest duration of disease at the time of observation. Vibration sense
was frequently decreased in the lower limbs. Hypernasal and slowed
speech was present in 2 patients and dysphagia in 1. Urinary urgency was
present in 3 patients, scoliosis and pes cavus in 2, and pale optic disc
in 2. There were no cerebellar or extrapyramidal signs in any of the 6
affected individuals (3 persons in each of 2 sibships who were related
as double first cousins, having been born from brothers married to
sisters).

Casari et al. (1998) reported 2 affected brothers from a small village
in southern Italy who showed typical signs of pure SPG with an age of
onset of 26 years. Casari et al. (1998) reported a French family with
autosomal recessive complicated SPG characterized by progressive
weakness and spasticity of the lower limbs, decreased perception of
sharp stimulation, diminished vibratory sense, and urinary incontinence.
Mean age of onset was 34 years. These patients also had optic atrophy (3
of 3 examined), cortical atrophy (1 of 3 examined), and cerebellar
atrophy (2 of 3 examined). Muscle biopsies showed ragged red fibers and
abnormal mitochondrial structure with no reaction to cytochrome c
oxidase, consistent with a defect in mitochondrial respiration.

Elleuch et al. (2006) reported a Moroccan family in which 4 sibs had
SPG7. Age at onset ranged from 28 to 32 years with instability and stiff
legs, which rapidly progressed to lower limb spasticity and weakness
with hyperreflexia. Three patients could not run, and 1 could walk only
with help. All had pes cavus, but none had extensor plantar responses.
One patient had nystagmus, another had cerebellar signs, and a third had
bladder dysfunction; none had decreased visual acuity. Two patients had
impaired sensation at the ankles.

Warnecke et al. (2007) reported a consanguineous Turkish family in which
3 sibs had a complicated form of SPG7. Age at onset ranged from 10 to 25
years, with gait disturbances in 2 sibs and dysarthria in 1. Clinical
features included lower limb spasticity, pyramidal signs, lower limb
hyperreflexia, supranuclear palsy, nystagmus, and cerebellar dysarthria.
Two of the sibs, who were more severely affected, also had ataxia and
extensor plantar responses, and 1 had urinary incontinence.
Neuropsychologic evaluations showed severe deficits in attention and
executive function in all sibs. The more severely affected sibs also
showed impaired working memory and verbal learning. However, none of the
sibs reported cognitive deficits. Brain MRI showed cerebellum atrophy
and mild frontal cortical atrophy. Diffusion tensor imaging showed
decreased white matter in the corticospinal tracts, frontal lobes, and
midbrain. There was no evidence of peripheral neuropathy or optic
atrophy. Molecular analysis identified a homozygous mutation in the SPG7
gene (602783.0006). Warnecke et al. (2007) suggested that the diffuse
involvement may reflect mitochondrial dysfunction.

INHERITANCE

Although SPG7 has classically been considered to show an autosomal
recessive mode of inheritance, there is also evidence for autosomal
dominant transmission in some families (Sanchez-Ferrero et al., 2013).

MAPPING

In a large consanguineous family with SPG, De Michele et al. (1998)
demonstrated linkage to 16q24.3, with markers D16S413 (maximum lod score
3.37 at a recombination fraction of 0.00) and D16S303 (maximum lod score
3.74 at a recombination fraction of 0.00). Multipoint analysis localized
the disease gene in the most telomeric region, with a lod score of 4.2.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Casari et al. (1998) found that all affected individuals from the SPG7
family reported by De Michele et al. (1998) were homozygous for a 9.5-kb
deletion (602783.0003) in the SPG7 gene.

In 1 of 2 brothers from a small village in southern Italy who had
autosomal recessive hereditary pure spastic paraplegia, Casari et al.
(1998) identified a homozygous 2-bp deletion in the paraplegin cDNA
(602783.0001), resulting in a frameshift that abolished approximately
60% of the protein. In a French family with SPG, they identified
homozygosity for a 1-bp insertion (602783.0002) in all affected sibs;
the mother was heterozygous for the mutation.

In 4 affected sibs from a Moroccan family with SPG7, Elleuch et al.
(2006) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the SPG7
gene (602783.0004-602783.0005).

In 1 (0.7%) of 136 index patients with autosomal recessive SPG, Elleuch
et al. (2006) identified 2 mutations in the SPG7 gene. Twenty families
had at least 1 variant in the SPG7 gene that was not found in 550
control chromosomes. In 4 of these families, mutations were predicted to
be highly deleterious, suggesting that they may have contributed to the
phenotype. The authors identified several additional rare variants in
the SPG7 gene, which were of undetermined significance.

Arnoldi et al. (2008) identified 7 different SPG7 mutations (see, e.g.,
602783.0007-602783.0009) in 6 (4.4%) of 135 Italian patients with
spastic paraplegia. Four of the patients were heterozygous for the
mutations, which fell within conserved domains of the protein and were
not found in controls.

In 7 of 98 Dutch patients with apparently sporadic upper motor neuron
disease symptoms, Brugman et al. (2008) identified homozygosity or
compound heterozygosity for 6 mutations in the SPG7 gene that were of
known or probable pathogenicity. Six patients had lower limb involvement
only, and 1 patient had both upper and lower limb involvement. Three
patients developed cerebellar signs, including dysarthria and gait
ataxia, late in the disease course. None had bulbar involvement. Two
patients with pure spastic paraparesis carried a single pathogenic
mutation in the SPG7 gene.

Sanchez-Ferrero et al. (2013) sequenced the SPG7 gene in 285 Spanish
patients with spastic paraplegia who were negative for mutations in the
SPAST (604277) and ATL1 (606439) genes. Fourteen SPG7 mutations,
including 12 novel mutations, were identified in 14 patients. The
mutations included 2 large deletions, 5 missense changes, 4 nonsense
mutations, 2 frameshift insertion/deletions, and 1 splice site mutation.
Thirteen patients had only a single heterozygous mutation, suggesting a
dominant effect for some SPG7 mutations. Functional studies were not
performed to assess the biologic significance. An A510V (dbSNP
rs61755320) substitution (602783.0012) was found in 8 patients (3%): 4
carried A510V in compound heterozygous state with another SPG7 mutation,
1 was homozygous for A510V, and 3 patients were heterozygous for A510V.
The A510V substitution was also identified in 1% of controls. All
patients had adult onset of the disorder, but only 35% had a complicated
phenotype.

148069	TITLE *148069 KERATIN 17; KRT17
;;K17;;
CYTOKERATIN 17
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Among the members of the cytokeratin subfamily of intermediate filament
(IF) proteins, cytokeratin-17 is remarkable since it is normally
expressed in the basal cells of complex epithelia but not in stratified
or simple epithelia. Troyanovsky et al. (1992) isolated a cDNA clone
encoding KRT17 from a HeLa cDNA library. A number of lambda-phage clones
were isolated that covered 3 distinct, noncontiguous gene regions. Only
one of these contains the functional KRT17 gene, which is located about
5 kb 5-prime upstream of the KRT16 gene (148067), whereas the other 2
contain unprocessed KRT17 pseudogenes. Each of these genes is part of
the large keratin type I gene cluster on chromosome 17. The functional
KRT17 gene differs from the pseudogenes by the extent of methylation of
certain DNA sequences in the 5-prime upstream region. The KRT17 gene
encodes a polypeptide of 432 amino acids with a calculated molecular
weight of 48,000. Using S1-nuclease protection assays and RNAs from
several cell lines, Troyanovsky et al. (1992) identified a single
transcriptional start point 26 nucleotides downstream from a TATA box
element. Synthesis of cytokeratin-17 seems to be a marker of basal cell
differentiation in complex epithelia and therefore indicative of a
certain type of epithelial 'stem cell.'

GENE FUNCTION

Kim et al. (2006) showed that keratin-17, an intermediate filament
protein rapidly induced in wounded stratified epithelia, regulates cell
growth through binding to the adaptor protein 14-3-3-sigma (601290).
Mouse skin keratinocytes lacking keratin-17 show depressed protein
translation and are of smaller size, correlating with decreased Akt/mTOR
(164730/601231) signaling activity. Other signaling kinases have normal
activity, pointing to the specificity of this defect. Two amino acid
residues located in the N-terminal head domain of keratin-17 are
required for the serum-dependent relocalization of 14-3-3-sigma from the
nucleus to the cytoplasm, and for the concomitant stimulation of mTOR
activity and cell growth. Kim et al. (2006) concluded that their
findings revealed a new and unexpected role for the intermediate
filament cytoskeleton in influencing cell growth and size by regulating
protein synthesis.

In mice, Takeo et al. (2013) showed that nail stem cells (NSCs) reside
in the proximal nail matrix and are defined by high expression of
keratin-14 (148066), keratin-17, and KI67 (MKI67; 176741). The
mechanisms governing NSC differentiation are coupled directly to their
ability to orchestrate digit regeneration. Early nail progenitors
undergo Wnt (see 164820)-dependent differentiation into the nail. After
amputation, this Wnt activation is required for nail regeneration and
also for attracting nerves that promote mesenchymal blastema growth,
leading to the regeneration of the digit. Amputations proximal to the
Wnt-active nail progenitors result in failure to regenerate the nail or
digit. Nevertheless, beta-catenin (116806) stabilization in the NSC
region induced their regeneration. Takeo et al. (2013) concluded that
their results established a link between nail stem cell differentiation
and digit regeneration, and suggested that NSCs may have the potential
to contribute to the development of novel treatments for amputees.

GENE STRUCTURE

Troyanovsky et al. (1992) determined that the KRT17 gene is 5 kb long
with 8 exons.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

McLean et al. (1995) found a mutation in the KRT17 gene (148069.0001) in
a large Scottish kindred in which pachyonychia congenita had been shown
to be linked to markers that mapped within the type I keratin cluster on
17q (Munro et al., 1994). Smith et al. (1997) reported heterozygous
KRT17 missense mutations in the same conserved protein motif in a
further 5 pachyonychia families of the Jackson-Lawler type (PC2;
167210). They also showed heterozygous missense mutations in KRT17 in 2
families diagnosed as steatocystoma multiplex (see 148069.0004). On
review, mild nail changes were observed in some but not all of these
patients. They concluded that phenotypic variation is observed with
KRT17 mutations as is the case with other keratin disorders.

KRT17 is expressed in the nail bed, hair follicle, sebaceous glands, and
other epidermal appendages. Covello et al. (1998) described 3 unrelated
kindreds carrying KRT17 mutations. Two of these families had identical
missense mutations (R94C; 148069.0006) in the 1A domain of KRT17.
However, while affected members of 1 kindred had the classic features of
pachyonychia congenita type 2, affected persons in the other family had
the steatocystoma multiplex phenotype. In a third family with type 2
pachyonychia congenita, an N92S mutation (148069.0002) was detected.

ANIMAL MODEL

K17-null mice develop alopecia in the first week after birth,
correlating with hair shaft fragility and untimely apoptosis in the hair
bulb (McGowan et al., 2002). Tong and Coulombe (2006) showed that this
abnormal apoptosis reflected premature entry into catagen. K17-null skin
keratinocytes in primary culture were more sensitive to Tnf (191160)
than to other proapoptotic challenges. K17 interacted with Tradd
(603500), a death adaptor essential for Tnf receptor-1 (TNFRSF1A;
191190)-dependent signal transduction, suggesting a functional link
between K17 and TNF signaling. The activity of Nfkb (see 164011), a
downstream target of Tnf, was increased in K17-null skin. Ablation of
Tnf partly rescued the hair cycling defect of K17-null mice.

Gli2(tg) mice are transgenic mice that overexpress the hedgehog
signaling protein Gli2 (165230) and develop basal cell carcinoma (BCC;
see 605462) and basaloid follicular hamartoma. DePianto et al. (2010)
found that expression of Krt17 was induced before the onset of lesions
in the epidermis of Gli2(tg) mice. Deletion of Krt17 in Gli2(tg) mice
reduced the inflammatory response and the frequency of mitotically
active cells, and it resulted in better preservation of skin barrier
function. Absence of Krt17 in Gli2(tg) Krt17 -/- skin correlated with
reduction in T-helper-1 (Th1) proinflammatory and Th17 antimicrobial T
cells and induction of Th2 antiinflammatory markers. Deletion of Krt17
also downregulated BCC-related matrix metalloproteases (e.g., MMP3;
185250) and normalized altered cytokine expression. Phorbol ester
treatment enhanced proliferation of Gli2(tg) cells, but not Gli2(tg)
Krt17 -/- cells. DePianto et al. (2010) concluded that KRT17 has a role
in modulating the immune response in hedgehog-driven basaloid skin
tumors.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
PACHYONYCHIA CONGENITA, TYPE 2
KRT17, ASN92ASP

In a kindred with autosomal dominant pachyonychia congenita of the
Jackson-Lawler type (167210), which is characterized by dystrophic nails
and other ectodermal aberrations, McLean et al. (1995) found
heterozygosity for a missense mutation, asn92 to asp, in the helix
initiation motif of keratin-17. Munro et al. (1994) had previously shown
linkage of the disease locus to the 17q region where the type I keratin
cluster is located.

.0002
PACHYONYCHIA CONGENITA, TYPE 2
KRT17, ASN92SER

In a family in which 5 individuals in 3 generations had pachyonychia
congenita of the Jackson-Lawler type (167210), Smith et al. (1997) found
an A-to-G transition in the KRT17 gene, producing the predicted
asn92-to-ser (N92S) amino acid change. The identical mutation was found
in 3 sporadic cases. The mutation created a new DdelI site.

In a 3-generation British Caucasian family, Covello et al. (1998) found
the same N92S mutation in the KRT17 gene as the cause of pachyonychia
congenita type 2. The 18-year-old proband presented with rough skin due
to follicular keratoses, and thickened nails and plantar skin. Although
she did not have clinically obvious cysts, and had mild hyperkeratosis
of the buccal mucosa, other family members had abnormal nails,
blistering of the feet, and multiple cysts. Her mother had a history of
painful keratoses and blistering on the feet, with thickened nails,
yellowish cysts on the trunk and limbs, and recurrent flexural
abscesses. She also had multiple milia. A lesion excised from the labium
majus proved to be an epidermoid cyst. This family had previously been
reported as having pachyonychia congenita with hidradenitis suppurativa
(Todd et al., 1990). Covello et al. (1998) stated that within a single
large pedigree (Munro et al., 1994), and indeed in a single individual
with multiple cysts, they had found that some were true steatocysts and
others keratinous cysts, some of which contained vellus hair. Scrotal
and vulvar cystomatosis also form part of the syndrome.

.0003
PACHYONYCHIA CONGENITA, TYPE 2
KRT17, TYR98ASP

In a family in which the father and 2 daughters had pachyonychia
congenita of Jackson-Lawler type (167210), Smith et al. (1997)
identified a heterozygous 440T-G transversion in the KRT17 gene,
producing an asn92-to-his amino acid substitution in affected
individuals.

.0004
STEATOCYSTOMA MULTIPLEX
KRT17, ASN92HIS

In a mother and daughter with steatocystoma multiplex (184500), Smith et
al. (1997) demonstrated heterozygosity for the transversion 422A-C in
the KRT17 gene, which was predicted to produce the amino acid change,
asn92 to his.

.0005
STEATOCYSTOMA MULTIPLEX
PACHYONYCHIA CONGENITA, TYPE 2, INCLUDED
KRT17, ARG94HIS

In a kindred in which 8 individuals in 3 generations had steatocystoma
multiplex (184500), Smith et al. (1997) found heterozygosity for a
purine transition 429G-A causing the predicted arg94-to-his amino acid
substitution. The mutation occurred in residue 10 of the K17 helix
initiation peptide and potentially was a CpG deamination mutation.
Although originally diagnosed steatocystoma multiplex, on restudy some
but not all of the patients were found to have mild nail changes
compatible with those of pachyonychia congenita. Affected individuals
showed a severe phenotype consisting of myriads of cysts in the groin,
perineum, axillae, trunk, and face. These were pictured by Smith et al.
(1997). Histologic examination of cysts from the proband showed
sebocytes within an epithelial wall characterized by slight
epidermolytic hyperkeratosis. Nail changes were completely absent in the
male proband who had myriads of cysts; however, his sister had slight
thickening of the thumb nails and another sister had thickened
fingernails but normal toenails. There was no family history of natal
teeth but some members had mild focal nonepidermolytic palmoplantar
keratoderma. Cysts in the steatocystoma families and the families with
pachyonychia congenita, Jackson-Lawler type (see 148069.0002 and
148069.0003), were indistinguishable clinically and histologically.

Terrinoni et al. (2001) reported this mutation in a patient with
sporadic pachyonychia congenita type 2 (167210).

.0006
STEATOCYSTOMA MULTIPLEX
PACHYONYCHIA CONGENITA, TYPE 2, INCLUDED
KRT17, ARG94CYS

Covello et al. (1998) described 2 unrelated kindreds with the identical
missense mutation (arg94 to cys; R94C) in the 1A domain of keratin 17.
However, while affected members of 1 kindred had the classic features of
type 2 pachyonychia congenita (167210), affected persons in the other
family had the steatocystoma multiplex phenotype (184500). The PC2
family consisted of affected mother and son; the affected steatocystoma
multiplex family had affected mother, son, and daughter. The proband in
the first family had a history of subcutaneous yellow nodules on the
flexor surfaces of the arms, abdomen, and legs since puberty. She also
had thickened nails of the feet. In the steatocystoma multiplex family,
the 41-year-old Dutch Caucasian mother presented at an outpatient clinic
because of what she described as 'acne present from puberty.' The number
of lesions had increased with age; in addition to the face, lesions were
present on the abdomen, arms, and legs. Her 4-year-old daughter and
11-year-old son were developing similar skin problems. Multiple nodules
with varying diameter were found in the areas mentioned. None of the
affected persons showed any nail changes or any other skin, hair, or
mucosal abnormalities.

.0007
PACHYONYCHIA CONGENITA, TYPE 2
KRT17, MET88THR

Celebi et al. (1999) described a mother and son of Caribbean origin with
type 2 pachyonychia congenita (167210) due to heterozygosity for a
met88-to-thr mutation resulting from an ATG-to-ACG change in the KRT17
gene. The mother had developed thick dystrophic nails of the fingers and
toes during childhood. In the second decade of life, she developed
numerous cysts on the trunk as well as hidradenitis suppurativa in both
axillae. The 5-year-old son was born with natal teeth and had cutaneous
findings similar to those in the mother.

.0008
PACHYONYCHIA CONGENITA, TYPE 2
KRT17, 15-BP DEL, NT279

In an Italian Caucasian family with pachyonychia congenita type 2
(167210) described by Clementi et al. (1986), Smith et al. (2001)
reported a novel heterozygous 15-bp deletion in the K17 gene, 279del15.
This was the first report of a deletion in K17 and led to removal of the
amino acid sequence RLASY (R94-98del) from the highly conserved 1A
domain of the K17 protein (deletion of 1A domain residues 10-14).

.0009
PACHYONYCHIA CONGENITA, TYPE 2
KRT17, ARG94PRO

In an Australian Caucasian female with sporadic pachyonychia congenita
type 2 (167210), Smith et al. (2001) reported a novel heterozygous
arg94-to-pro (R94P) mutation that arose from a 281G-C transversion in
the K17 gene. This mutation occurred within the helix initiation 1A
domain hotspot for pathogenic keratin mutations.

.0010
PACHYONYCHIA CONGENITA, TYPE 2
KRT17, LEU95GLN

In a French Caucasian female with sporadic pachyonychia congenita type 2
(167210), Smith et al. (2001) reported a novel heterozygous 284T-A
transversion in the K17 gene, resulting in a leu95-to-gln (L95Q) amino
acid substitution. This mutation occurred within the helix initiation 1A
domain hotspot for pathogenic keratin mutations.

.0011
PACHYONYCHIA CONGENITA, TYPE 2
KRT17, LEU95PRO

In a patient with sporadic pachyonychia congenita type 2 (167210),
Terrinoni et al. (2001) reported a leu95-to-pro (L95P) mutation in the
1A domain of the KRT17 protein, resulting from a 284T-C transition. This
mutation may also be referred to as L11P.

.0012
PACHYONYCHIA CONGENITA, TYPE 2
KRT17, SER97DEL

In a patient with sporadic pachyonychia congenita type 2 (167210),
Terrinoni et al. (2001) reported a deletion of 3 nucleotides at position
289 of the KRT17 gene (289delCCT), predicting deletion of serine-97
(S97del) in the 1A domain. This mutation may also be referred to as
S13del.

.0013
PACHYONYCHIA CONGENITA, TYPE 2
KRT17,LEU99PRO

In a family with pachyonychia congenita type 2 (167210), Terrinoni et
al. (2001) identified a leu99-to-pro (L99P) mutation in the 1A domain of
the KRT17 protein, resulting from a 296T-C transition. This mutation may
also be referred to as L15P.

.0014
PACHYONYCHIA CONGENITA, TYPE 2
KRT17, VAL102MET

In a patient with pachyonychia congenita type 2 (167210), Hashiguchi et
al. (2002) identified heterozygosity for a 452G-A (GTG to ATG)
transition in the helix initiation motif of the K17 gene, resulting in a
predicted val102-to-met (V102M) substitution.
