DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CD44 is an integral cell membrane glycoprotein with a postulated role in
matrix adhesion lymphocyte activation and lymph node homing (Aruffo et
al., 1990).

CLONING

Telen et al. (1983) used a murine monoclonal antibody (A3D8) to identify
an erythrocyte antigen inhibited by the In(Lu) gene. Telen et al. (1984)
showed that the A3D8 antigenic property resides on an 80-kD red cell
membrane protein which is present in only trace amounts in In(Lu)
Lu(a-b-) red cells (INLU; 111150). Haynes (1986) had evidence that the
A1G3 and A3D8 monoclonal antibodies bind to different epitopes on the
same 80-kD molecule. The monoclonal antibody A3D8 recognized an antigen
officially called MDU3, for 'monoclonal Duke University, 3,' or CD44.
Telen (1992) knew of no evidence that the INLU and CD44 (MDU3) genes are
the same.

By screening cDNA libraries prepared from hemopoietic cell lines,
Stamenkovic et al. (1989) isolated CD44 clones. Immunoprecipitation of
CD44 from transfected COS cells and cultured cell lines detected
cell-specific expression of an 80- to 90-kD protein and a 160-kD
protein. Several minor forms of 52 to 200 kD were variably present in
different cell types. RNA blot analysis revealed transcripts of 1.6,
2.2, and 5.0 kb in hemopoietic cell lines. RNA blot analysis of
carcinoma cell lines revealed 3 patterns of expression: the first,
exemplified by melanoma cell lines, was identical to the hemopoietic
cell pattern associated with the 80- to 90-kD isoform; the second,
exemplified by a colon carcinoma cell line, showed transcripts of 2.0,
2.6, and 5.6 kb associated with the 160-kD isoform; and the third,
exemplified by another colon carcinoma cell line, was a composite of the
first 2 patterns. All primary carcinoma specimens examined showed
prevalent CD44 transcripts of either hemopoietic or composite type. The
CD44 cDNA encodes a 361-amino acid protein with a 20-residue secretory
signal peptide, a 248-residue extracellular N-terminal domain with
multiple N- and O-linked glycosylation sites, a 21-amino acid
transmembrane domain, and a 72-residue hydrophilic cytoplasmic domain.
The mature protein has a calculated molecular mass of 37 kD. Sequence
analysis suggested homology with chicken and rat cartilage link proteins
(HAPLN1; 115435).

Stefanova et al. (1989) demonstrated that the lymphocyte homing receptor
is identical to the human leukocyte surface glycoprotein called CDw44,
on the basis of studies at the Third International Workshop on Human
Leukocyte Differentiation Antigens. It also appears to be identical to
the Pgp-1 glycoprotein of Omary et al. (1988).

GENE FAMILY

A table of all the CD antigens was provided by Schlossman et al. (1994)
with a list of the common names, the size in kilodaltons, and the nature
of the protein (adhesion, myeloid, platelet, and B cell, T cell, etc.).

GENE STRUCTURE

Screaton et al. (1992) found that the CD44 gene contains 19 exons
spanning 50 kb of genomic DNA. They identified 10 alternatively spliced
exons within the extracellular domain, including 1 exon that had not
previously been reported. In addition to the inclusion or exclusion of
whole exons, additional diversity was generated through the utilization
of internal splice donor and acceptor sites within 2 of the exons. A
variation in the cytoplasmic domain was shown to result from the
alternative splicing of 2 exons. Thus the genomic structure of CD44 is
remarkably complex, and alternative splicing is the basis of its
structural and functional diversity.

Nedvetzki et al. (2003) noted that human CD44 isoforms are generated
from 9 variant exons (v2 to v10) inserted in different combinations
between 2 constant regions consisting of 5 exons at the N terminus and 4
exons at the C terminus (constant exon 19 is noncoding). Direct splicing
of constant exon 5 to constant exon 16, thereby skipping the variant
exons, generates the standard CD44 isoform.

GENE FUNCTION

Aruffo et al. (1990) demonstrated that CD44 is the main cell surface
receptor for hyaluronate. Mature lymphocytes in the circulation migrate
selectively from the bloodstream to different lymphatic tissues through
specialized high endothelial venules (HEV). Molecules on the surface of
lymphocytes called homing receptors interact specifically with HEV and
play a central role in the migration.

Splice variants of the glycoprotein CD44 may be associated with
metastases and therefore may be useful in the early detection of
metastatic potential in surgical biopsy specimens, as well as in the
early diagnosis of cancer in screening programs, assessment of remaining
disease, and early detection of recurrence (Matsumura and Tarin, 1992).
Mayer et al. (1993) found that expression of CD44, which is not found in
normal gastric mucosa and is found in only 49% of primary tumors, was
associated with distant metastases at time of diagnosis and with tumor
recurrence and increased mortality from gastric cancer.

Weber et al. (1996) noted that the CD44 gene encodes a transmembrane
protein that is expressed as a family of molecular isoforms generated
from alternative RNA splicing and posttranslational modifications.
Certain CD44 isoforms that regulate activation and migration of
lymphocytes and macrophages may also enhance local growth and metastatic
spread of tumor cells. One ligand of CD44 is hyaluronic acid, binding of
which to the NH2-terminal domain of CD44 enhances cellular aggregation
and tumor cell growth. (Krainer et al. (1991) referred to CD44 as a
'hyaladherin' -- see 601269.) Weber et al. (1996) demonstrated that
another ligand is osteopontin (166490). Osteopontin induces cellular
chemotaxis but not homotypic aggregation of cells, whereas the inverse
is true for the interaction between CD44 and hyaluronate. The
alternative responses to CD44 ligation may be exploited by tumor cells
to allow OPN-mediated metastatic spread and hyaluronate-dependent growth
in newly colonized tissues in the process of tumor metastasis.

Sherman et al. (1998) investigated the role of CD44 proteins in early
limb development. Members of this family of transmembrane glycoproteins
are expressed by cells of the limb bud, including those of the apical
ectodermal ridge (AER). Distinct CD44 variants are generated from a
single gene by alternative RNA splicing of up to 10 variant exons and by
extensive posttranslational modifications. The amino acid sequences
encoded by these variant exons are located in the extracellular portion
of the protein near the transmembrane domain. A standard form of CD44
lacking these variant sequences is expressed by numerous cell types and
is the smallest CD44 protein. It carries no variant exon sequences.
Splice variants are expressed in only a limited number of tissues and in
certain tumors. Signals from the AER of the developing vertebrate limb,
including fibroblast growth factor-8 (600483), can maintain limb
mesenchymal cells in proliferative state. Sherman et al. (1998) reported
that a specific CD44 splice variant is crucial for the proliferation of
these mesenchymal cells. Epitopes carried by this variant colocalize
temporally and spatially with FGF8 in the AER throughout early limb
development. A splice variant containing the same sequence expressed on
model cells binds both FGF4 (164980) and FGF8 and stimulates mesenchymal
cells in vitro. Sherman et al. (1998) found that when applied to the
AER, an antibody against a specific CD44 epitope blocked FGF
presentation and inhibited limb outgrowth. Therefore, CD44 is necessary
for limb development and functions in a novel growth factor presentation
mechanism likely relevant to other physiologic and pathologic situations
in which a cell surface protein presents a signaling molecule to a
neighboring cell.

Cywes and Wessels (2001) demonstrated that CD44-dependent group A
Streptococcus binding to polarized monolayers of human keratinocytes
induced marked cytoskeletal rearrangements manifested by membrane
ruffling and disruption of intercellular junctions. Transduction of the
signal induced by group A Streptococcus binding to CD44 on the
keratinocyte surface involved Rac1 (602048) and the cytoskeleton linker
protein ezrin (123900), as well as tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular
proteins. Studies of bacterial translocation in 2 models of human skin
indicated that cell signaling triggered by interaction of the group A
Streptococcus capsule with CD44 opened intercellular junctions and
promoted tissue penetration by group A Streptococcus through a
paracellular route. Cywes and Wessels (2001) concluded that their
results support a model of host cytoskeleton manipulation and tissue
invasion by an extracellular bacterial pathogen.

Nedvetzki et al. (2003) identified a CD44 variant, designated CD44vRA,
in synovial fluid aspirated from 23 of 30 patients with rheumatoid
arthritis (RA; 180300). Sequence analysis showed that the CD44vRA
isoform contains an intron-derived CAG trinucleotide inclusion 5-prime
to constant exon 5 within the CD44v3-v10 isoform. Functional expression
studies in human cells showed that the CD44vRA variant interacted with
FGF2 (134920) via the heparan sulfate on exon v3 in a way that enhanced
binding and activation of soluble FGFR1 (136350) to a greater extent
than CD44v3-v10. Synovial fluid cells from RA patients bound soluble
FGFR1 more intensively than control cells. Nedvetzki et al. (2003)
postulated that activation of FGFR1 may play a role in the RA
inflammatory process.

In a mouse hindlimb model of arteriogenesis, van Royen et al. (2004)
found that Cd44 expression increased strongly during collateral vessel
growth in wildtype mice and that arteriogenesis was severely impaired in
Cd44 -/- mice. The defective arteriogenesis was accompanied by reduced
leukocyte trafficking to sites of collateral artery growth and reduced
expression of FGF2 and platelet-derived growth factor-B protein (PDGFB;
190040). In 14 consecutive patients with single-vessel coronary artery
disease, van Royen et al. (2004) found that the maximal expression of
CD44 on activated monocytes was reduced in patients with poor
collateralization compared to patients with good collateralization. Van
Royen et al. (2004) concluded that CD44 plays a pivotal role in
arteriogenesis.

By analyzing a human breast cancer cell line transduced with a micro RNA
(miRNA) expression library, Huang et al. (2008) found that human miR373
(611954) and miR520C stimulated cell migration and invasion in vitro and
in vivo. Using expression array analysis, they found that the migration
phenotype of miR373- and miR520C-expressing cells depended on
suppression of CD44. Upregulation of miR373 correlated inversely with
CD44 expression in breast cancer metastasis samples. The authors noted
that increased expression of the most common CD44 isoform correlates
with overall survival of breast cancer patients.

Godar et al. (2008) found that p53 (TP53; 191170) negatively regulated
CD44 expression in normal human mammary epithelial cells by binding to a
noncanonical p53-binding sequence in the CD44 promoter. Inhibition of
CD44 enabled the cells to respond to stress-induced, p53-dependent
cytostatic and apoptotic signals that would have otherwise been blocked
by CD44. In the absence of p53, CD44 promoted growth in a highly
tumorigenic mammary epithelial cell line. In both normal and tumorigenic
cell lines, p63 (TP63; 603273) positively regulated CD44 expression.

MAPPING

Francke et al. (1983) showed that the antigens defined by monoclonal
antibodies A3D8 and A1G3 are determined by genes on 11p.

The mouse monoclonal antibody Hermes-3 recognizes the 85- to 95-kD human
lymphocyte homing receptor. Using mouse-human T-lymphocyte hybrids and
hybrids of Chinese hamster ovary cells with human amniotic fibroblasts,
Ala-Kapee et al. (1989) found that Hermes-3 expression, as demonstrated
by indirect immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation, was determined
by 11pter-p13. Forsberg et al. (1989) refined the assignment of the
lymphocyte homing receptor gene to 11pter-p13 by study of Chinese
hamster-human cell hybrids in which the human parent cells had various
deletions of human chromosome 11. Although CD44 may have function as a
lymphocyte homing receptor, the gene that maps to chromosome 11 is
distinct from the lymph node homing receptor located on chromosome 1
(153240) (Seldin, 1990). In the mouse, the corresponding gene has been
referred to as Ly-24.

Cianfriglia et al. (1992) mapped a drug-sensitivity marker, MC56, to
11pter-p13. Identity of the protein to the CD44 antigen, suggested on
other grounds, was supported by the map location.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

The Indian blood group (609027) comprises 2 antigens, In(a) and In(b),
which reside on CD44. By RT-PCR analysis of cDNA extracted from
In(a+b-)-transformed B lymphocytes, Telen et al. (1996) identified the
CD44 polymorphism that causes the In(b-) phenotype. The polymorphism
results in an arg46-to-pro change (R46P; 107269.0001), removing the
basically charged amino acid at the C terminus of the hyaluronan
(HA)-binding motif of CD44. In previous studies using chimeric proteins,
arg46 was shown to be crucial for HA binding by CD44 (Yang et al.,
1994). However, Telen et al. (1996) demonstrated that the R46P change
does not reduce HA binding to CD44.

ANIMAL MODEL

Schmits et al. (1997) generated mice deficient in all known isoforms of
Cd44 by targeting exons encoding the invariant N-terminal region of the
molecule. Mice were born in mendelian ratio without any obvious
developmental or neurologic deficits. Hematologic impairment was
evidenced by altered tissue distribution of myeloid progenitors with
increased levels of colony-forming unit-granulocyte-macrophage in bone
marrow and reduced numbers in spleen. Fetal liver colony-forming
unit-spleen and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor mobilization
assays, together with reduced colony-forming unit-granulocyte-macrophage
in peripheral blood, suggested that progenitor egress from the bone
marrow was defective. Mice also developed exaggerated granuloma
responses to Cryotosporidium parvum infection. Tumor studies showed that
SV40-transformed Cd44-deficient fibroblasts were highly tumorigenic in
nude mice, whereas reintroduction of Cd44 expression into these
fibroblasts resulted in a dramatic inhibition of tumor growth.

Teder et al. (2002) studied the role of Cd44 in lung inflammation by
using the Cd44-deficient mice generated by Schmits et al. (1997). After
intratracheal administration of bleomycin, 75% of Cd44-deficient mice
died by day 14. They developed unremitting inflammation, characterized
by impaired clearance of apoptotic neutrophils, persistent accumulation
of hyaluronan fragments at the site of the tissue injury, and impaired
activation of transforming growth factor beta-1 (190180). This phenotype
was partially reversed by reconstitution with Cd44+ cells, thus
demonstrating a critical role for this receptor in resolving lung
inflammation.

Using immunohistochemistry, Leemans et al. (2003) confirmed that
Cd44-high cells accumulated in mouse lungs following intranasal
infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Cd44 -/- mice, however, had a
50% reduction in pulmonary macrophages 2 weeks after infection, although
the absolute numbers of leukocytes were unchanged. By 5 weeks after
infection, a significant reduction in Cd4 (186940)-positive lymphocyte
numbers was observed in mutant mice. At both time points, the
Cd44-deficient mice displayed disorganized granulomas containing
predominantly polymorphonuclear neutrophils rather than well-demarcated
granulomas consisting of lymphocytes and macrophages. Splenocytes were
more numerous in mice lacking Cd44, and they secreted significantly more
Ifng (147570) in response to antigen-specific stimulation than
splenocytes of wildtype mice. Flow cytometric analysis showed that human
CD44 bound to M. tuberculosis, and Cd44 -/- mouse macrophages contained
fewer bacteria than wildtype macrophages. The mutant mice allowed
greater replication of M. tuberculosis in lung and liver and had reduced
survival compared with wildtype mice. Leemans et al. (2003) proposed
that CD44 mediates resistance to mycobacterial infection by promoting
binding and phagocytosis by macrophages and by recruiting these cells to
the site of infection.

TNF (191160) is a major inducer of chronic inflammation, and its
overexpression leads to chronic inflammatory arthritis. Hayer et al.
(2005) crossed Cd44 -/- mice with mice transgenic for human TNF and
found that destruction of joints and progressive crippling was far more
severe in Cd44 -/- transgenic mice than in transgenic mice expressing
Cd44. Cd44 -/- transgenic mice exhibited increased systemic bone
resorption due to an increase in the number, size, and activity of
osteoclasts. Bone formation and osteoblast differentiation were not
affected. Cd44 -/- osteoclasts had an enhanced response to TNF that was
associated with increased activation of p38 (MAPK14; 600289). Hayer et
al. (2005) concluded that CD44 is a critical inhibitor of TNF-induced
joint destruction and inflammatory bone loss.

Krause et al. (2006) found that mice lacking Cd44 were as susceptible as
wildtype mice to murine chronic myeloid leukemia (CML; 608232) after
challenge with BCR-ABL virus. However, bone marrow cells from Cd44 -/-
mice transduced with the virus showed defective homing to recipient bone
marrow, resulting in decreased engraftment and reduced CML-like disease.
In contrast, Cd44 was dispensable for induction of B-lymphoblastic
leukemia-like disease. Krause et al. (2006) concluded that CD44 is
required for leukemic stem cells that initiate CML.

Jin et al. (2006) found that treatment with activating monoclonal
antibodies to CD44 markedly reduced leukemic repopulation in nonobese
diabetic (NOD)/severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice challenged
with human acute myeloid leukemia (AML; 601626) cells. Absence of
leukemia following serial tumor transplantation experiments in mice
demonstrated direct targeting of AML leukemic stem cells (LSCs).
Treatment of engrafted mice with anti-CD44 reduced the number of Cd34
(142230)-positive/Cd38 (107270)-negative primitive stem cells and
increased the number of Cd14 (158120)-positive monocytic cells.
Anti-CD44 treatment also diminished the homing capacity of SCID
leukemia-initiating cells to bone marrow and spleen. Jin et al. (2006)
concluded that CD44 is a key regulator of AML LSCs, which require a
niche to maintain their stem cell properties. They suggested that CD44
targeting may help eliminate quiescent AML LSCs.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
INDIAN BLOOD GROUP SYSTEM POLYMORPHISM
CD44, ARG46PRO

The Indian blood group (609027) comprises 2 antigens, In(a) and In(b),
which reside on CD44. By RT-PCR analysis of cDNA extracted from
In(a+b-)-transformed B lymphocytes, Telen et al. (1996) identified the
CD44 polymorphism that causes the In(b-) phenotype. The G-to-C change at
nucleotide 252 results in an arg46-to-pro change (R46P), removing the
basically charged amino acid at the C terminus of the hyaluronan
(HA)-binding motif of CD44. In previous studies using chimeric proteins,
arg46 was shown to be crucial for HA binding by CD44 (Yang et al.,
1994). However, Telen et al. (1996) demonstrated that the R46P change
does not reduce HA binding to CD44.

605828	TITLE *605828 TRANSMEMBRANE CHANNEL-LIKE PROTEIN 6; TMC6
;;EPIDERMODYSPLASIA VERRUCIFORMIS GENE 1; EVER1; EV1
DESCRIPTION For phenotypic information on epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV), see
226400.

CLONING

Ramoz et al. (2002) positionally cloned the EVER1 gene from the EV1
locus on 17q25 (Ramoz et al., 1999). Computational analysis of the EV1
interval on the Human Genome Draft Sequence allowed construction of a
contig of partially sequenced overlapping BACs. The region contained the
genes encoding thymidine kinase-1 (TK1; 188300) and synaptogyrin-2
(SYNGR2; 603926) as well as the EV1 and EV2 genes, which were assigned
the symbols EVER1 and EVER2 (605829), respectively. The EVER1 gene
encodes 2 alternatively spliced proteins, one of 805 amino acids and the
other of 454 amino acids, in the same open reading frame. The EVER1
protein was predicted to contain 10 transmembrane domains and 2 leucine
zipper motifs. EVER1 shares approximately 75% amino acid identity with a
mouse homolog, and EVER1 and EVER2 share approximately 28% of their
constituent amino acids. EVER1 and EVER2 are expressed in the cytoplasm
and colocalize with calnexin (114217), an integral membrane protein
located in the endoplasmic reticulum.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ramoz et al. (2002) determined that the EVER1 gene contains 20 exons.
The EVER1 and EVER2 genes are in opposite orientation from the first
in-frame ATG start codon and are separated by 4,732 bp.

MAPPING

Ramoz et al. (1999) mapped a susceptibility locus for epidermodysplasia
verruciformis (226400) to chromosome 17qter (EV1), within the 1-cM
interval between markers D17S939 and D17S802 in 3 consanguineous
families. Ramoz et al. (2000) performed genotyping for 10 microsatellite
markers spanning 29 cM around EV1 in 2 additional consanguineous
epidermodysplasia verruciformis families. Using homozygosity mapping,
linkage with 17qter markers was observed in 1 family, and multipoint
linkage analysis yielded maximum multipoint lod score values above 10
between markers D17S1839 and D17S802, encompassing the EV1 locus.

Ramoz et al. (2002) narrowed the EV1 interval to about 180 kb on 17q25
and cloned the EVER1 gene from this region.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Ramoz et al. (2002) studied 2 Algerian and 2 Colombian consanguineous
families who had been previously described (Ramoz et al., 1999; Ramoz et
al., 2000) and an additional EV1-linked Algerian family in which an
individual was affected with HPV5. In 2 Algerian families and in 1
Colombian family, Ramoz et al. (2002) found that epidermodysplasia
verruciformis was associated with homozygosity for separate nonsense
mutations of the EVER1 gene. They also found 2 mutations in the EVER2
gene.

In a Japanese woman with epidermodysplasia verruciformis, Tate et al.
(2004) identified compound heterozygosity for mutations in the EVER1
gene (605828.0003-605828.0004).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
EPIDERMODYSPLASIA VERRUCIFORMIS
TMC6, ARG94TER

In 2 consanguineous Algerian families, Ramoz et al. (2002) found that
epidermodysplasia verruciformis (226400) was associated with
homozygosity for a C-to-T transition of nucleotide 280 in the TMC6 cDNA,
predicted to cause a nonsense change, arg94 to ter (R94X). Affected
individuals in the 2 families shared the same haplotype markers in
homozygosity, suggesting a common ancestral mutation.

.0002
EPIDERMODYSPLASIA VERRUCIFORMIS
TMC6, GLU576TER

In a consanguineous Colombian family, Ramoz et al. (2002) found that
epidermodysplasia verruciformis (226400) was associated with
homozygosity for a 1726G-T transversion in the TMC6 gene, resulting in a
glu576-to-ter (E576X) mutation.

.0003
EPIDERMODYSPLASIA VERRUCIFORMIS
TMC6, TYR248TER

In a 65-year-old Japanese woman with epidermodysplasia verruciformis
(226400), Tate et al. (2004) found compound heterozygosity for mutations
in the TMC6 gene: a 744C-A transversion in exon 8, resulting in a
tyr248-to-ter mutation (Y248X), and an IVS8AS-2A-T transversion
(605828.0004). The patient had suffered from warts beginning when she
was a teenager. Excision of Bowen disease from the skin of the hand was
carried out 3 times at the ages of 51, 52, and 64 years, and gastrectomy
was performed for gastric cancer when she was 53 years of age. Multiple
skin cancers of the face showed squamous cell carcinoma and Bowen
disease. The parents were unaffected and were not related. Three of 6
sibs were also affected.

176991	TITLE *176991 S100 CALCIUM-BINDING PROTEIN A5; S100A5
;;S100D
DESCRIPTION The S100 proteins are small calcium-binding proteins which display
different expression patterns in human tissues. Some S100 proteins are
associated with tumor development and the metastatic behavior of tumors.
Engelkamp et al. (1993) established the physical linkage of 6 S100 genes
by pulsed field gel electrophoresis and DNA sequencing of 15 kb
containing the full coding region of 4 different S100 genes: S100E
(S100A3; 176992), CAPL (S100A4; 114210), S100D (S100A5), and calcyclin
(S100A6; 114110). Engelkamp et al. (1993) stated that 'this is the
tightest mammalian gene cluster discovered so far.' The cluster was
assigned to 1q21 by in situ hybridization. Two other S100 genes were
located within 450 kb: S100L (S100A2; 176993) and S100A (S100A1;
176940).

Schafer et al. (1995) isolated a YAC from 1q21 on which 9 different
genes coding for S100 calcium-binding proteins could be localized. The
clustered organization of S100 genes allowed introduction of a new
logical nomenclature based on their physical arrangement on the
chromosome, with S100A1 being closest to the telomere and S100A9
(123886) being closest to the centromere. In this nomenclature, S100D
became S100A5.

610488	TITLE *610488 TETRATRICOPEPTIDE REPEAT DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 9; TTC9
;;KIAA0227
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated myeloid leukemia
cell line cDNA library, Nagase et al. (1996) cloned TTC9, which they
called KIAA0227. The deduced protein contains 336 amino acids. Northern
blot analysis detected TTC9 expression in all tissues examined, with
highest expression in heart, skeletal muscle, and pancreas.

Cao et al. (2006) determined that TTC9 encodes a predicted 222-amino
acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 24.4 kD. It has 3
C-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat domains and several potential
N-myristoylation sites, but no transmembrane domain. Northern blot
analysis detected a 2.5-kb TTC9 transcript in a breast cancer cell line.
Northern blot analysis of several human tissues showed variable
expression of 2.5-, 5.1-, and 5.9-kb TTC9 transcripts. Expression of
TTC9 was highest in brain, followed by heart. Western blot analysis
revealed a 25-kD endogenous TTC9 protein in a breast cancer cell line.
Analysis of several normal tissues showed the 25-kD protein in all
tissues examined except liver. A doublet of 36 to 37 kD was also
expressed in brain. Cell fractionation experiments and
immunohistochemical analysis showed that TTC9 was predominantly
associated with the endoplasmic reticulum, although a small fraction was
cytoplasmic.

GENE FUNCTION

By microarray analysis, Cao et al. (2006) found that expression of TTC9
was regulated by progesterone in a breast cancer cell line expressing
progesterone receptor (PGR; 607311). They showed that TTC9 levels were
also regulated by estrogen, growth factors, and an inhibitor of p38
kinase (MAPK14; 600289). Growth factor-induced TTC9 expression was
inhibited by estrogen and abolished by an ERK (see 601795) inhibitor.
The hormonal effect on TTC9 expression was cell-line specific, and TTC9
appeared to be upregulated when the hormonal effect on cells was growth
inhibitory and downregulated when the hormonal effect was stimulatory.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid and human-rodent cell hybrid analyses, Nagase et al.
(1996) mapped the TTC9 gene to chromosome 14. Cao et al. (2006) stated
that the TTC9 gene maps to chromosome 14q24.2.

191060	TITLE *191060 TRYPTOPHAN HYDROXYLASE 1; TPH1
;;TPH
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH; EC 1.14.16.4) catalyzes the
biopterin-dependent monooxygenation of tryptophan to 5-hydroxytryptophan
(5HT), which is subsequently decarboxylated to form the neurotransmitter
serotonin. It is thus the rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of
serotonin. TPH expression is limited to a few specialized tissues: raphe
neurons, pinealocytes, mast cells, mononuclear leukocytes, beta-cells of
the islets of Langerhans, and intestinal and pancreatic enterochromaffin
cells.

CLONING

Stoll et al. (1990) isolated a cDNA for tryptophan hydroxylase (Tph)
from a library constructed from RNA prepared from a mouse mastocytoma
cell line. Boularand et al. (1990) gave the sequence of a cDNA clone
containing the complete coding sequence of TPH.

GENE FUNCTION

Matsuda et al. (2004) found that mouse mammary glands stimulated by
prolactin (176760) expressed genes essential for serotonin biosynthesis,
including Tph. Tph mRNA was elevated during pregnancy and lactation, and
serotonin was detected in the mammary epithelium and in milk. Tph was
induced by prolactin in mammosphere cultures and by milk stasis in
nursing dams, suggesting that expression of TPH is controlled by milk
filling in the alveoli. Serotonin suppressed beta-casein (115460)
expression and caused shrinkage of mammary alveoli. Conversely,
disruption of the Tph gene or antiserotonergic drugs enhanced secretory
features and alveolar dilation. Matsuda et al. (2004) concluded that
autocrine-paracrine serotonin signaling is an important regulator of
mammary homeostasis and early involution.

The liver can regenerate its volume after major tissue loss. Lesurtel et
al. (2006) showed that in a mouse model of liver regeneration,
thrombocytopenia resulted in the failure to initiate cellular
proliferation in the liver. Platelets are major carriers of serotonin in
the blood. In thrombocytopenic mice, a serotonin agonist reconstituted
liver proliferation. The expression of 5-HT2A (182135) and 2B (601122)
subtype serotonin receptors in the liver increased after hepatectomy.
Antagonists of 5-HT2A and 2B receptors inhibited liver regeneration.
Liver regeneration was also blunted in mice lacking TPH1, which is the
rate-limiting enzyme for the synthesis of peripheral serotonin. This
failure of regeneration was rescued by reloading serotonin-free
platelets with a serotonin precursor molecule. Lesurtel et al. (2006)
concluded that platelet-derived serotonin is involved in the initiation
of liver regeneration.

Loss- and gain-of-function mutations in mouse Lrp5 (603506) affect bone
formation, causing osteoporosis and high bone mass, respectively. Yadav
et al. (2008) identified Tph1 as the most highly overexpressed gene in
Lrp5 -/- mice. Tph1 expression was also elevated in Lrp5 -/- duodenal
cells, its primary site of expression. Decreasing serotonin blood levels
normalized bone formation and bone mass in Lrp5 -/- mice, and
gut-specific Lrp5 inactivation decreased bone formation in a
beta-catenin (CTNNB1; 116806)-independent manner. Moreover, gut-specific
activation of Lrp5 or inactivation of Tph1 increased bone mass and
prevented ovariectomy-induced bone loss in mice. Yadav et al. (2008)
showed that serotonin determined the extent of bone formation by binding
its receptor, Htr1b (182131), on osteoblasts and limiting osteoblast
proliferation by inhibiting Creb (see 123810)-mediated cyclin D1 (CCND1;
168461) expression. Yadav et al. (2008) concluded that LRP5 inhibits
bone formation by inhibiting serotonin production.

To examine putative central and peripheral sources of embryonic brain
5-HT (serotonin), Bonnin et al. (2011) used Pet1 (FEV; 607150)-null mice
in which most dorsal raphe neurons lack 5-HT. They detected previously
unknown differences in accumulation of 5-HT between the forebrain and
hindbrain during early and late fetal stages, through an exogenous
source of 5-HT which is not of maternal origin. Using additional genetic
strategies, a new technology for studying placental biology ex vivo and
direct manipulation of placental neosynthesis, Bonnin et al. (2011)
investigated the nature of this exogenous source and uncovered a
placental 5-HT synthetic pathway from a maternal tryptophan precursor in
both mice and humans. The mouse placenta expresses both Tph1 and Aadc
(608643) in the syncytiotrophoblastic cell layer at embryonic days 10.5
through 14.5. Human placental fetal villi at 11 weeks' gestation showed
robust 5-HT neosynthesis, indicating that a placental source of 5-HT is
important for human fetal development. Bonnin et al. (2011) concluded
that their study revealed a new, direct role for placental metabolic
pathways in modulating fetal brain development and indicated that
maternal-placental-fetal interactions could underlie the pronounced
impact of 5-HT on long-lasting mental health outcomes.

GENE STRUCTURE

Gizatullin et al. (2006) noted that the TPH1 gene spans 29 kb and
contains 11 exons.

MAPPING

Using a clone for rabbit tryptophan hydroxylase as a probe in the study
of a panel of hamster-human somatic cell hybrids, Ledley et al. (1987)
assigned the gene to chromosome 11. They discussed the evolution of the
aromatic amino acid hydroxylase superfamily, which also includes TH
(191290), located at 11p15.5, and phenylalanine hydroxylase (612349),
located at 12q24.1. The locations of these genes and their evolutionary
distance (as indicated by their sequences) suggested to Ledley et al.
(1987) that at least 3 distinct genetic events have occurred during the
evolution of this superfamily: 2 sequential gene duplications giving
rise to 3 distinct loci, and a translocation which separated the
tryptophan and tyrosine hydroxylase loci on chromosome 11 from the
phenylalanine hydroxylase locus on chromosome 12. HGM9 regionalized the
assignment to 11p15-p13. Craig et al. (1991) regionalized the assignment
to 11p15.3-p14 by in situ hybridization.

By examining introns of the human TPH gene by PCR amplification and
analysis by the single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP)
technique, Nielsen et al. (1992) identified an informative intronic
polymorphism useful in linkage studies. Using this polymorphism in 24
informative CEPH families, they showed that TPH lies between D11S151 and
D11S134.

Stoll et al. (1990) mapped the mouse Tph gene by Southern blot analysis
of somatic cell hybrids and by an interspecific backcross to a position
in the proximal half of chromosome 7. Thus, this is another example of
homology of synteny between human chromosome 11 and mouse chromosome 7.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Bellivier et al. (2004) conducted a metaanalysis of 9 association
studies (961 patients and 1,485 controls) of the relationship between
the A218C polymorphism of the TPH gene and suicidal behavior. A
significant association was observed between this polymorphism and
suicidal behavior using the fixed effect method (odds ratio, 1.62; 95%
CI, 1.26; 2.07) and in the random effect method (odds ratio = 1.61; CI,
1.11; 2.35). When 2 of the studies that deviated from the calculated
global effect were removed, significant association remained. A
dose-dependent effect of the A allele on the risk for suicidal behavior
was observed.

Stefulj et al. (2006) studied the TPH1 A218C polymorphism in 247 male
victims of violent suicide and 320 controls of Slavic (Croatian) origin,
with specific relation to age. The frequency of the CC genotype was
increased in victims aged 65 and older as compared to controls (p =
0.0126 and 0.0008, for comparison with age-specific and integral control
samples, respectively), while there was no difference between victims
under age 65 and controls. The authors suggested a possible combined
effect of the genetic factor and physiologic changes due to aging on the
predisposition to violent suicide.

In a metaanalysis of 34 case-control studies from 21 published articles
and an unpublished paper, Li and He (2006) found an overall association
between suicidal behavior and the TPH A779C/A218C polymorphisms. The A
allele was the risk allele for both polymorphisms, yielding an odds
ratio of 1.12 overall for carriers of both A alleles. Sand (2007)
commented that the report of Li and He (2006) used pooled populations,
pooled SNP frequencies, imprecise phenotypes, and redundant reports, and
questioned the finding of allelic association.

Gizatullin et al. (2006) screened TPH1 SNPs spanning over 23 kb
(promoter to exon 8) in 228 patients with major depression (608516) and
253 healthy control subjects. Several haplotypes were associated with
depression, and the 6-SNP haplotypes that occurred in less than 5% of
both groups were associated with the disease (31.6% vs 18.0% in
controls, p less than 0.00005). A sliding window analysis attributed the
strongest disease association to a 2-SNP haplotype comprising dbSNP
rs1799913 (A779C) and dbSNP rs7933505 localized between intron 7 and 8
(p less than 0.00005). Gizatullin et al. (2006) concluded that the most
common variants appear not to carry risk while some less frequent
variants might contribute to major depression.

Li et al. (2006) examined the relationship between the A218C and A-6526G
polymorphisms of the TPH1 gene and attention deficit-hyperactivity
disorder (ADHD; 143465) in the Chinese Han population; 362 unrelated
ADHD probands and their biologic parents were studied. No biased
transmission of any allele of the 2 polymorphisms was associated by
transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) analysis. However, haplotype
analysis showed that the rare 218A/-6526G haplotype was significantly
not transmitted to probands with ADHD (chi square = 4.4995, p = 0.034),
regardless of subtype.

Allen et al. (2008) performed a metaanalysis across all ancestries
comparing 829 patients with schizophrenia with 1,268 controls and found
that the A versus C allele at position 218 in intron 7 (dbSNP rs1800532)
of the TPH1 gene was associated with susceptibility to schizophrenia
(OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.15-1.51; p less than 8(-5)). According to the
Venice guidelines for the assessment of cumulative evidence in genetic
association studies (Ioannidis et al., 2008), the TPH1 association
showed a 'strong' degree of epidemiologic credibility.

ANIMAL MODEL

Walther et al. (2003) developed Tph-null mice. Mutant mice showed no
significant differences in 5HT-related behaviors and expressed normal
amounts of 5HT in classical serotonergic brain regions. However,
Tph-null mice lacked 5HT in the periphery, except for the duodenum.
Using RNAse protection assays, they determined that Tph2 (607478) is the
predominant isoform expressed in mouse brain.

Walther et al. (2003) found that mice selectively deficient in
peripheral Tph and serotonin exhibited impaired hemostasis, resulting in
a reduced risk of thrombosis and thromboembolism, although platelet
ultrastructure was not affected. While the aggregation of
serotonin-deficient platelets in vitro was apparently normal, their
adhesion in vivo was reduced due to reduced secretion of adhesive
alpha-granular proteins. Walther et al. (2003) showed that serotonin was
transamidated to small GTPases by transglutaminases (see TGM2; 190196)
during activation and aggregation of platelets, rendering these GTPases
constitutively active.

Using lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus in a Cd8 (see 186910)-positive
T cell-dependent mouse model of immunopathologic hepatitis, Lang et al.
(2008) showed that Tph1-deficient mice, but not wildtype mice,
normalized hepatic microcirculatory dysfunction, accelerated clearance
of virus from liver, and reduced Cd8-positive T cell-dependent liver
cell damage. In contrast, serotonin treatment of infected wildtype mice
delayed entry to liver of Cd8-positive T cells, delayed viral clearance,
and aggravated liver immunopathology. Lang et al. (2008) concluded that
vasoactive serotonin supports virus persistence in liver and aggravates
virus-induced immunopathology.

606493	TITLE *606493 EXOSOME COMPONENT 1; EXOSC1
;;CSL4, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; CSL4
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Inherently unstable mammalian mRNAs contain AU-rich elements (AREs)
within their 3-prime untranslated regions. In yeast, 3-prime-to-5-prime
mRNA degradation is mediated by the exosome, a multisubunit particle.
Chen et al. (2001) purified and characterized the human exosome by mass
spectrometry and found its composition to be similar to its yeast
counterpart. They identified the following protein subunits within the
human exosome: p7, which is homologous to the yeast Rrp4 protein
(602238); p8, which is homologous to the yeast Rrp42 protein (606488);
p9, which is homologous to the yeast Rrp43 protein (OIP2; 606019); p10,
which is homologous to the yeast Rrp40 protein (606489); p11, which is
homologous to the yeast Mtr3 protein (606490); p12A, which is homologous
to the yeast Rrp41 protein (606491); p12B, which is homologous to the
yeast Rrp46 protein (606492); and p13, which is homologous to the yeast
Csl4 protein. They also identified 2 exosome-associated factors, p1
(600478) and p14 (MPP6; 605500), that were not homologous to any yeast
exosome components.

Raijmakers et al. (2002) stated that the CSL4 protein contains 195 amino
acids and has a molecular mass of 21 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a cell-free RNA decay system, Chen et al. (2001) demonstrated that
the mammalian exosome is required for rapid degradation of
ARE-containing RNAs but not for poly(A) shortening. They found that the
mammalian exosome does not recognize ARE-containing RNAs on its own. ARE
recognition required certain ARE-binding proteins that could interact
with the exosome and recruit it to unstable RNAs, thereby promoting
their rapid degradation.

Using mammalian 2-hybrid and GST pull-down analyses, Raijmakers et al.
(2002) found that the CSL4 protein, but not mutant forms lacking N- or
C-terminal residues, interacted directly with RRP42 and RRP46. The
deletion mutants were also unable to interact with the exosome. RRP42
and RRP46 did not interact with each other.

191510	TITLE *191510 COLD-SHOCK DOMAIN-CONTAINING E1, RNA-BINDING; CSDE1
;;GENE UPSTREAM OF NRAS;;
UNR;;
D1S155E
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

While investigating NRAS (164790), Jeffers et al. (1990) isolated cDNAs
that originated from a closely linked upstream gene on chromosome 1.
RNase protection assays showed that this gene, termed UNR by them, is
transcribed in the same direction as NRAS and that its 3-prime end is
located only 130 bp from the transcription initiation site of NRAS. The
close spatial relationship was conserved in all species from which the
NRAS gene had been isolated. The UNR cDNA contained an open reading
frame capable of encoding a protein of 798 amino acids. UNR transcripts
were detected in mouse, rat, and human cells. Only a single copy of UNR
was detected in the mouse. The gene produced multiple transcripts that
differed in their 3-prime ends and apparently resulted from the
differential use of multiple polyadenylation sites located in the
3-prime untranslated region of the gene. Both UNR and NRAS were
expressed in all tissues examined and the 2 genes may be coordinately
regulated. UNR was first isolated by Doniger and DiPaolo (1988) in
tumorigenic guinea pig cells.

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) cloned full-length UNR, which they
designated KIAA0885. The deduced 798-amino acid protein shares 98.6%
amino acid identity with rat Unr. RT-PCR ELISA detected high expression
in all tissues examined.

GENE FUNCTION

AU-rich elements and protein-coding determinants direct rapid removal of
poly(A) tails as a necessary first step in mRNA decay. Grosset et al.
(2000) determined that 5 proteins form a multiprotein complex associated
with the major protein-coding-region determinant of instability (mCRD)
of the FOS gene (164810): PABP (604679), HNRNPD (601324), PAIP1
(605184), NSAP1, and UNR, a purine-rich RNA-binding protein.
Overexpression of these proteins stabilized mCRD-containing mRNA by
impeding deadenylation.

Chang et al. (2004) presented evidence that UNR is a critical factor in
mCRD-mediated mRNA turnover by binding the mCRD motif and by interacting
with PABP. Their findings indicated that the mCRD-UNR complex serves as
a platform for formation of a deadenylation/decay mRNA-protein complex
involving PABP and the poly(A) nuclease CCR4 (608951).

MAPPING

Jeffers et al. (1990) mapped the UNR gene to chromosome 1, upstream of
the NRAS gene. By FISH, Edwards et al. (1997) localized the gene to
1p13.2.

612971	TITLE *612971 PDZ DOMAIN-CONTAINING 7; PDZD7
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Schneider et al. (2009) used positional cloning to identify the PDZD7
gene from junction fragments of a reciprocal t(10;11) translocation.
They identified 4 PDZD7 isoforms; isoforms A and B contain 2 PDZ
domains, and the shorter isoforms C and D contain no PDZ domains and 1
PDZ domain, respectively. RT-PCR analysis detected PDZD7 expression in
human cortex with weak expression in the human inner ear.

GENE STRUCTURE

Schneider et al. (2009) reported that PDZD7 consists of 16 exons
spanning 23.3 kb and results in 4 different transcripts. The A and B
isoforms are encoded by exons 2 to 8 or 9, and the C and D isoforms are
encoded by exons 6 to 13 and exons 13 to 16, respectively.

MAPPING

By positional cloning, Schneider et al. (2009) mapped the PDZD7 gene to
chromosome 10q24.3.

GENE FUNCTION

By GST pull-down assay and Western blot analysis, Schneider et al.
(2009) showed that PDZD7 interacted with SANS (USH1G; 607696) in HEK293T
cells. GST pull-down assay in mouse retina showed that PDZD7 also
interacted with harmonin (USH1C; 605242).

Ebermann et al. (2010) performed a yeast 2-hybrid screen of human fetal
brain and observed interaction of the PDZ2 domain of PDZD7 with the
C-terminal intracellular domain of GPR98 (602851), including its
PDZ-binding motif. Coimmunoprecipitation studies confirmed the
interaction and revealed that it is mediated by the PDZ2 domain of PDZD7
and the PDZ-binding motif of GPR98. In addition, coimmunoprecipitation
studies demonstrated interaction of the first and second PDZ domains of
PDZD7 with USH2A (608400); a truncated version of USH2A without the
C-terminal PDZ-binding motif showed reduced interaction.

CYTOGENETICS

In a boy with nonsyndromic congenital sensorineural hearing impairment,
born of consanguineous parents, Schneider et al. (2009) identified a
homozygous reciprocal 46,XY t(10;11),t(10;11) translocation. Examination
did not show any signs of retinitis pigmentosa or vestibular dysfunction
at age 8 years. Both parents and their 4 other children were
heterozygous translocation carriers. FISH analysis localized the
breakpoints to chromosome 10q24.3 in intron 10 of the PDZD7 gene and to
chromosome 11q23.3 in close proximity (less than 5 Mb) to 2 other
nonsyndromic deafness genes, RDX (179410) and TECTA (602574). The
10q24.3 breakpoint would disrupt the open reading frame of the C and D
isoforms of PDZD7. Schneider et al. (2009) suggested that the PDZD7 gene
can cause nonsyndromic autosomal recessive deafness and is also a prime
candidate gene for Usher syndrome (see 276900).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Modifier of Retinal Disease in Usher Syndrome Type IIA

In 2 French Canadian sisters with USH2A (276901), Ebermann et al. (2010)
analyzed the PDZD7 gene and identified heterozygosity for a de novo
frameshift mutation (612971.0001) in 1 of the sisters, who had
earlier-onset and more severe retinal disease. The authors concluded
that PDZD7 is a retinal disease modifier in patients with USH2A.

- Usher Syndrome Type IIC, GPR98/PDZD7 Digenic

In a 51-year-old German man with type II Usher syndrome (see USH2C,
605472) who was negative for mutation in the Usher syndrome genes USH2A
(608400), WHRN (607928), and CLRN1 (606397), Ebermann et al. (2010)
identified a heterozygous frameshift mutation in the GPR98 gene
(602851.0010) and a heterozygous frameshift mutation in the PDZD7 gene
(612971.0002). No second mutant allele was detected in GPR98 or PDZD7.

ANIMAL MODEL

Ebermann et al. (2010) characterized pdzd7 in zebrafish and identified 2
orthologs, pdzd7a and pdzd7b, which were expressed in retinal cells and
mechanosensory hair cells of the inner ear. Functional studies of the
ortholog with higher expression, pdzd7a, demonstrated localization in
the connecting cilium region of photoreceptors as well as in the apical
region of hair cells in the inner ear and neuromasts in young fish.
Strong pdzd7a localization at the ciliary base as well as more diffuse
labeling of photoreceptor outer segments persisted in adult retinas,
indicating postdevelopmental function. Morpholino knockdown of pdzd7a
produced Usher-like symptoms that had previously been described in
zebrafish Usher gene mutations, including circling, reduced startle
reflex, and disorganized stereocilia. Half-strength morpholino knockdown
produced no impairment of balance or retinal cell survival when used
alone, whereas combined partial pdzd7a;gpr98 knockdown produced
Usher-like circling and retinal degeneration. In addition, no Usher-like
phenotype was observed in combined partial pdzd7a;ush2a knockdown.
However, knockdowns of either ush2a or pdzd7a alone produced similar
moderate levels of photoreceptor cell death, and this degeneration
increased dramatically when embryos were treated with a full dose of
ush2a morpholino combined with a half dose of pdzd7a morpholino. The
cell death observed in these retinas was restricted to the
photoreceptors, and the retinas were otherwise morphologically normal.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
RETINAL DISEASE IN USHER SYNDROME TYPE IIA, MODIFIER OF
PDZD7, 1-BP INS, 166C

Ebermann et al. (2010) analyzed the PDZD7 gene in 2 French Canadian
sisters with USH2A (276901) who were homozygous for a frameshift
mutation in the USH2A gene (608400.0003), and identified heterozygosity
for an additional de novo 1-bp insertion (166insC) in the PDZD7 gene in
1 of the sisters, who had earlier-onset and more severe retinal disease.
The PDZD7 mutation was not present in the less-affected sister or in 254
controls.

.0002
USHER SYNDROME, TYPE IIC, GPR98/PDZD7 DIGENIC
PDZD7, 9-BP INS, NT2194

In a 51-year-old German man with Usher syndrome (see USH2C; 605472),
Ebermann et al. (2010) identified a heterozygous 9-bp deletion
(2194_2203del) in the PDZD7 gene and a heterozygous frameshift mutation
in the GPR98 gene (602851.0010). No second mutant allele was detected in
GPR98 or PDZD7. His unaffected sister was heterozygous for the PDZD7
mutation but did not carry the GPR98 mutation; the PDZD7 mutation was
not found in 405 controls.

180903	TITLE *180903 RYANODINE RECEPTOR 3; RYR3
;;RYANODINE RECEPTOR, BRAIN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Ryanodine receptors, such as RYR3, are intracellular calcium ion release
channels responsible for the release of Ca(2+) from intracellular stores
following transduction of many different extracellular stimuli.

CLONING

Hakamata et al. (1992) deduced the complete amino acid sequence of a
novel ryanodine receptor/calcium release channel from rabbit brain by
cloning and sequence analysis of the cDNA. The protein was composed of
4,872 amino acids and shared characteristic structural features with the
skeletal muscle (RYR1; 180901) and cardiac (RYR2; 180902) ryanodine
receptors. RNA blot hybridization analysis showed that the brain
ryanodine receptor is abundantly expressed in corpus striatum, thalamus,
and hippocampus, whereas the cardiac ryanodine receptor is more
uniformly expressed in the brain. The brain ryanodine receptor gene was
also transcribed in smooth muscle.

Using rabbit Ryr3 cDNA as probe, Nakashima et al. (1997) cloned RYR3
from a brain cDNA library. The deduced 4,866-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of about 551 kD. RYR3 contains 4 repeated
sequences organized into 2 tandem pairs, as well as 4 highly hydrophobic
C-terminal segments. It does not have an N-terminal signal sequence.
Northern blot analysis detected a 16-kb transcript expressed at high
levels in caudate nucleus, amygdala, and hippocampus, and at lower
levels in corpus callosum, substantia nigra, and thalamus. Abundant
expression was also detected in skeletal muscle, and a faint signal was
detected in heart.

Leeb and Brenig (1998) isolated overlapping human RYR3 clones from a
random primed fetal brain cDNA library. The gene encodes a 4,870-amino
acid polypeptide that contains 4 RYR repeats, 3 SPRY domains, an ATP/GTP
binding site consensus sequence, and 3 potential calmodulin-binding
sites. They identified an alternatively spliced transcript that encodes
a truncated protein.

Jiang et al. (2003) identified 7 alternatively spliced variants of
rabbit Ryr3 that were expressed in a tissue-specific manner.

GENE FUNCTION

By functional expression of RYR3 and a chimeric RYR, Nakashima et al.
(1997) confirmed that RYR3 forms a calcium release channel with low
Ca(2+) sensitivity.

Jiang et al. (2003) characterized several rabbit Ryr3 splice variants.
One variant lacked a predicted transmembrane helix encoded by exon 92
and was highly expressed in smooth muscle tissues, but not in skeletal
muscle, heart, or brain. This variant did not form a functional Ca(2+)
channel when expressed alone in HEK293 cells, but it formed functional
heteromeric channels with reduced caffeine sensitivity when coexpressed
with wildtype Ryr3. This variant was also able to form heteromeric
channels with and suppress the activity of Ryr2 in a dominant-negative
manner. Jiang et al. (2003) concluded that the heterogeneity of Ryr3
splice variants may explain the unique tissue-specific pharmacologic and
functional properties of Ryr3.

MAPPING

By isotopic in situ hybridization, Sorrentino et al. (1993) mapped the
RYR3 gene to 15q14-q15; 15q15 is a probable location. By in situ
hybridization, Mattei et al. (1994) mapped the type 3 ryanodine receptor
to mouse chromosome 2E5-2F3. Richard et al. (1994) presented an
integrated physical, expression, and genetic map of chromosome 15. They
found that the RYR3 gene fell in their region I: 15pter-q14.

ANIMAL MODEL

Takeshima et al. (1996), Bertocchini et al. (1997), and Futatsugi et al.
(1999) independently generated Ryr3-deficient mice. In all cases, the
homozygous mutant mice were fertile and displayed no gross
abnormalities. Takeshima et al. (1996) detected increased locomotor
activity in Ryr3 knockout mice compared to that of the control mice and
concluded that the lack of Ryr3-mediated Ca(2+) signaling results in
abnormalities of certain neurons in the central nervous system.

Bertocchini et al. (1997) detected normal Ryr3 expression in murine
skeletal muscles during the postnatal phase of muscle development, but
not in muscles of adult mice, with the exception of the diaphragm and
soleus muscles. The authors demonstrated that skeletal muscle
contraction in Ryr3 knockout mice was impaired during the first weeks
after birth. They concluded that Ryr3 has a physiologic role in
excitation-contraction coupling of neonatal skeletal muscles.

Futatsugi et al. (1999) measured the electrophysiologic and
pharmacologic properties of synaptic plasticity in the CA1 area of
Ryr3-deficient mice. The results suggested that Ryr3-mediated
intracellular calcium release from endoplasmic reticulum may inhibit
hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and spatial learning.

Barone et al. (1998) generated double mutant mice carrying a targeted
disruption of both the Ryr1 and Ryr3 genes. Skeletal muscles from mice
homozygous for both mutations did not contract in response to caffeine
or ryanodine. In addition, these muscles showed very low tension when
directly activated with micromolar ionized calcium after membrane
permeabilization, indicating either poor development or degeneration of
the myofibrils. This was confirmed by biochemical analysis of
contractile proteins. Electron microscopy confirmed small size of
myofibrils and showed complete absence of feet (RyRs) in the junctional
sarcoplasmic reticulum.

Balschun et al. (1999) found that hippocampal tissue from Ryr3 knockout
mice showed no morphologic changes and had robust in vitro LTP induced
by repeated strong tetanization in the CA1 region, similar to control
tissue. However, the hippocampal tissue from the mutant mice showed
significantly impaired initial amplitude of potentiation and LTP
maintenance in response to weak tetanization compared to controls. In a
water maze test, the mutant animals showed normal learning acquisition
but had deficits in spatial learning, suggesting impaired synaptic
plasticity. Balschun et al. (1999) concluded that RYR3 has a functional
role in hippocampal synaptic plasticity, specifically on the adaptation
of acquired memory in response to external changes or stimuli.

VASCULAR ATP DIPHOSPHOHYDROLASE; ATPDase;;
APYRASE
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Endothelial cells have the ability to regulate platelet activation, in
part by the surface expression of ATP diphosphohydrolase (ATPDase; EC
3.6.1.5). ATPDase hydrolyzes extracellular ATP and ADP to AMP, which is
further converted to adenosine by another enzyme, 5-prime nucleotidase.
ADP is a powerful agonist for platelet recruitment and adhesion;
adenosine is an antagonist of these processes. Kaczmarek et al. (1996)
demonstrated that CD39, a B-cell activation marker previously
characterized by Maliszewski et al. (1994), encodes vascular ATPDase.
They isolated the cDNA of human ATPDase/CD39 by RT-PCR using RNA from
human umbilical endothelial cells. They expressed this cDNA in COS-7
cells and confirmed that it is expressed on the cell surface, hydrolyzes
both ATP and ADP, and inhibits platelet aggregation. CD39 was found to
have both immunologic identity to, and functional characteristics of,
vascular ATPDase. By Northern blot analysis, Chadwick and Frischauf
(1998) found that CD39 is expressed as a major 3.2- and a minor 3.6-kb
mRNA in several tissues. Additional bands were observed in a few
tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

Adrian et al. (2000) analyzed the expression of several purinergic
receptors, as well as CD39 and CD73 (NT5E; 129190), during
differentiation in a promyelocytic leukemia cell line. Granulocytic
differentiation was induced by dimethylsulfoxide, and a
monocytic/macrophage phenotype was induced by phorbol esters. CD39
expression was nearly undetectable in undifferentiated cells, but
differentiation to either granulocytic or monocytic cells caused a
strong increase in CD39 transcript. CD39 was moderately expressed in
normal blood leukocytes.

MAPPING

Gray et al. (1997) mapped the CD39 gene to a YAC contig of 10q24 between
the genes for CYP2C (see 124020) and DNTT (187410).

ANIMAL MODEL

CD39 has been considered an important inhibitor of platelet activation.
Unexpectedly, Enjyoji et al. (1999) found that Cd39-deficient mice had
prolonged bleeding times with minimally perturbed coagulation
parameters. Platelet interactions with injured mesenteric vasculature
were considerably reduced in vivo, and purified mutant platelets failed
to aggregate to standard agonists in vitro. This platelet hypofunction
was reversible and associated with purinergic type P2y1 receptor
(601167) desensitization. In keeping with deficient vascular protective
mechanisms, fibrin deposition was found at multiple organ sites in
Cd39-deficient mice and in transplanted cardiac grafts. The data
indicated the dual role for CD39 in modulating hemostasis and thrombotic
reactions.

Langerhans cells (LC) are members of the dendritic cell (DC) family of
antigen-presenting cells residing in the skin. Wolff and Winkelmann
(1967) established that LC can be simply identified with light, rather
than electron, microscopy using surface ATPase staining. Mizumoto et al.
(2002) established that LC from CD39 -/- mice are not able to hydrolyze
both ATP and ADP and that CD39 +/- mice have a diminished ability to
effect ATP and ADP hydrolysis compared to wildtype mice. Histochemical,
Northern, and Western blot analyses showed that CD39 is expressed in
epidermal DC but not keratinocyte cell lines. CD39-deficient mice have
amplified inflammatory responses to irritant chemicals, while
heterozygous mice have intermediate responses compared to wildtype mice.
On the other hand, CD39 -/- mice have similar responses to ultraviolet
radiation and attenuated responses to contact allergens compared to
heterozygotes and wildtype mice. Using a fluorescent contact allergen,
Mizumoto et al. (2002) showed that the mutant mice LC are functional in
their homing and phenotypic maturation but are less able to stimulate T
cells, indicating that CD39 expression is required for optimal
stimulation of hapten-reactive T cells in mice. CD39-deficient DC are
unresponsive to ATP and are susceptible to cell death after prolonged
exposure to ADP. Mizumoto et al. (2002) and Granstein (2002) proposed
that if keratinocyte release of ATP and ADP occurs in response to all
chemical irritants and if the magnitude of release correlates with the
potency of the irritant, measurement of this release may be a useful in
vitro method to assess the risk of cosmetics and other topical agents
instead of animal testing.
