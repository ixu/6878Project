;;AMPHIPHYSIN I
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Lichte et al. (1992) isolated a novel synaptic vesicle-associated
protein, amphiphysin, by screening a chicken brain lambda-gt11 library
with antibodies raised against chicken brain synaptic proteins. An
acidic protein present also in mammalian nervous tissue, amphiphysin,
was shown by immunocytochemistry to be concentrated in nerve terminals.
See also amphiphysin-like (AMPHL; 601248).

GENE FUNCTION

David et al. (1994) found that the N- and C-terminal domains of the
amphiphysin protein are highly conserved between chicken and human.
Autoantibodies from patients with the stiff-man syndrome show a dominant
autoepitope located in the C-terminal region, which contains an SH3
domain.

Yamamoto et al. (1995) noted that the tissue distribution of AMPH and
its association with neurotransmitter vesicles make the gene a candidate
for involvement in such diverse heritable disorders as those of the
nervous system, certain endocrine tissues (such as the adrenal medulla,
pituitary gland or endocrine pancreas), or male fertility.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Pathogenic Role of Anti-Amphiphysin Antibodies

Stiff-man syndrome (184850) is a rare disease of the central nervous
system characterized by progressive rigidity of the body musculature
with superimposed painful spasms. An autoimmune origin of the disease
has been proposed. Approximately 60% of patients are positive for
autoantibodies directed against the GABA-synthesizing enzyme glutamic
acid decarboxylase (GAD; 605363). A few patients, all women affected by
breast cancer, were found to be negative for GAD autoantibodies but
positive for autoantibodies directed against a 128-kD synaptic protein.
De Camilli et al. (1993) found that this antigen is amphiphysin. Both
GAD and amphiphysin are nonintrinsic membrane proteins that are
concentrated in nerve terminals, where a pool of the 2 proteins is
associated with the cytoplasmic surface of synaptic vesicles.

Wessig et al. (2003) reported a 71-year-old woman with invasive ductal
carcinoma and a paraneoplastic stiff-person syndrome characterized by
stiffness in the right arm, stiff and unsteady gait, and increased
sweating. Anti-amphiphysin antibodies were detected in the patient's
serum and CSF, and the patient temporarily responded to plasmapheresis.
Postmortem studies detected antibodies in the central nervous system
parenchyma, suggesting a pathogenic role.

- Crystal Structure

Peter et al. (2004) solved the structure of the Drosophila amphiphysin
BAR domain. It is a crescent-shaped dimer that binds preferentially to
highly curved negatively charged membranes. With its amino-terminal
amphipathic helix and BAR domain, amphiphysin can drive membrane
curvature in vitro and in vivo. The structure is similar to that of
arfaptin-2 (601638), which Peter et al. (2004) found also binds and
tubulates membranes. From this, Peter et al. (2004) predicted that BAR
domains are in many protein families, including sorting nexins,
centaurins, and oligophrenins. The universal and minimal BAR domain is a
dimerization, membrane-binding, and curvature-sensing module.

MAPPING

By PCR analysis of hybrid cell DNAs and by fluorescence in situ
hybridization, Yamamoto et al. (1995) mapped the AMPH gene to 7p14-p13.
The homologous locus Amph was mapped to the proximal region of mouse
chromosome 13 by Jenkins et al. (1995).

Yamamoto et al. (1995) excluded AMPH as a candidate gene for either RP9
(180104) or dominant cystoid macular dystrophy (MDDC; 153880) by showing
that AMPH maps to a different segment of the genetic map of chromosome
7, defined by microsatellite markers, than does either of the eye
disorders.

ANIMAL MODEL

Di Paolo et al. (2002) generated Amph knockout mice and found that lack
of Amph caused a parallel loss of amphiphysin-2 (601248) selectively in
brain. Cell-free assembly of endocytic protein scaffolds was defective
in mutant brain extracts and there were defects in synaptic vesicle
recycling. These defects correlated with major learning deficits and
with increased mortality due to rare irreversible seizures, suggesting
that Amph has a critical role in higher brain functions.

603721	TITLE *603721 UBIQUITIN-CONJUGATING ENZYME E2L 3; UBE2L3
;;UBIQUITIN-CONJUGATING ENZYME UBCH7; UBCH7
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s or UBCs) are essential components of
the posttranslational protein ubiquitination pathway, mediating the
transfer of activated ubiquitin to substrate proteins.

CLONING

The S. cerevisiae UBC1, UBC4, and UBC5 enzymes appear to participate in
the degradation of short-lived and abnormal proteins. Human UBE2L1
(600012) is a homolog of yeast UBC4 and UBC5. By screening a genomic
library with a UBE2L1 probe, Moynihan et al. (1996) isolated clones
corresponding to a novel gene, UBE2L3.

Nuber et al. (1996) cloned human keratinocyte cDNAs encoding UBE2L3,
which they referred to as UBCH7. The predicted 154-amino acid protein
has 64% sequence similarity to UBCH5. UBCH7 efficiently mediated E6AP
(UBE3A; 601623)-dependent ubiquitination in an in vitro assay.

By RT-PCR, Moynihan et al. (1998) determined that UBE2L3 is expressed as
4 mRNAs that differ in the length of the 3-prime untranslated region
(UTR). Sequence comparisons revealed that the human and mouse UBE2L3
cDNAs share 97% DNA sequence identity in the coding region and 93%
identity for 287 nucleotides extending into the 3-prime UTR. The
predicted mouse and human UBE2L3 proteins are identical.

GENE STRUCTURE

Moynihan et al. (1996) demonstrated that the UBE2L3 and UBE2L1 genes are
identical except that the UBE2L1 gene is intronless, while the UBE2L3
coding sequence is interrupted by 3 introns. Moynihan et al. (1998)
determined that the UBE2L3 gene spans approximately 57 kb.

MAPPING

By analysis of somatic cell hybrids and by FISH, Moynihan et al. (1996)
mapped the UBE2L3 gene to chromosome 22q11.2-q13.1. They also mapped a
pseudogene, UBE2L2, to 12q12. Ardley et al. (1997) found that another
pseudogene, UBE2L4, was located at 19q13.1-q13.2.

GENE FUNCTION

Shimura et al. (2001) hypothesized that alpha-synuclein (163890) and
parkin (602544) interact functionally, namely, that parkin ubiquitinates
alpha-synuclein normally and that this process is altered in autosomal
recessive Parkinson disease (600116). Shimura et al. (2001) identified a
protein complex in normal human brain that includes parkin as the E3
ubiquitin ligase, UBCH7 as its associated E2 ubiquitin-conjugating
enzyme, and a novel 22-kD glycosylated form of alpha-synuclein
(alpha-Sp22) as its substrate. In contrast to normal parkin, mutant
parkin associated with autosomal recessive Parkinson disease failed to
bind alpha-Sp22. In an in vitro ubiquitination assay, alpha-Sp22 was
modified by normal, but not mutant, parkin into polyubiquitinated, high
molecular weight species. Accordingly, alpha-Sp22 accumulated in a
nonubiquitinated form in parkin-deficient Parkinson disease brains.
Shimura et al. (2001) concluded that alpha-Sp22 is a substrate for
parkin's ubiquitin ligase activity in normal human brain and that loss
of parkin function causes pathologic accumulation of alpha-Sp22. These
findings demonstrated a critical biochemical reaction between the 2
Parkinson disease-linked gene products and suggested that this reaction
underlies the accumulation of ubiquitinated alpha-synuclein in
conventional Parkinson disease.

Carrano et al. (2009) identified the E3 ubiquitin ligase Wwp1 (602307)
as a positive regulator of life span in C. elegans in response to
dietary restriction. Overexpression of Wwp1 in worms extended life span
by up to 20% under conditions of ad libitum feeding. Conversely,
reduction of Wwp1 completely suppressed the extended longevity of
diet-restricted animals. The E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ubc18,
which is homologous to human UBE2L3, interacted with Wwp1 and was
required for Wwp1 ubiquitin ligase activity and the extended longevity
of worms overexpressing Wwp1. Carrano et al. (2009) concluded that Wwp1
and Ubc18 function to ubiquitinate substrates that regulate longevity
induced by diet restriction.

Wenzel et al. (2011) showed that, unlike many ubiquitin-conjugating
enzymes (E2s) that transfer ubiquitin with RINGs, UBCH7 lacks intrinsic
ubiquitin ligase (E3)-independent reactivity with lysine, explaining its
preference for HECTs. Despite lacking lysine reactivity, UBCH7 exhibits
activity with the RING-in-between-RING (RBR) family of E3s that includes
parkin (602544) and human homolog of ariadne (HHARI; 605624). Found in
all eukaryotes, RBRs regulate processes such as translation and immune
signaling. RBRs contain a canonical C3HC4-type RING, followed by 2
conserved cys/his-rich zinc-binding domains, in-between-RING (IBR) and
RING2 domains, which together define this E3 family. Wenzel et al.
(2011) showed that RBRs function like RING/HECT hybrids: they bind E2s
via a RING domain, but transfer ubiquitin through an obligate
thioester-linked ubiquitin, requiring a conserved cysteine residue in
RING2. Wenzel et al. (2011) concluded that their results defined the
functional cadre of E3s for UBCH7, an E2 involved in cell proliferation
and immune function, and indicated a novel mechanism for an entire class
of E3s.

601710	TITLE *601710 EUKARYOTIC TRANSLATION INITIATION FACTOR 5; EIF5
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Eukaryotic translation initiation factor-5 (EIF5) interacts with the 40S
initiation complex to promote hydrolysis of bound GTP with concomitant
joining of the 60S ribosomal subunit to the 40S initiation complex. The
resulting functional 80S ribosomal initiation complex is then active in
peptidyl transfer and chain elongations (summary by Si et al., 1996).

CLONING

Si et al. (1996) cloned the gene encoding human EIF5. The gene encodes a
predicted 431-amino acid polypeptide that shares significant homology
with the rat sequence. The authors also characterized multiple mRNAs
expressed from the rat EIF5 gene and found that they differ only in the
lengths of their 3-prime untranslated regions. The transcript length
variations are tissue specific and arise from use of alternative
polyadenylation signals.

GENE FUNCTION

Das et al. (2001) characterized recombinant rat Eif5. They identified an
N-terminal GTPase-activating domain in addition to the C-terminal
Eif2-beta (EIF2S2; 603908)-binding region. Mutation analysis revealed 1
critical arginine and 2 critical lysine residues near the N terminus
that were essential for Eif5 function. Das et al. (2001) concluded that
Eif5 functions as a GTPase-activating protein.

EIF5 functions in start site selection as a GTPase accelerating protein
(GAP) for the EIF2-GTP-tRNAi(Met) ternary complex within the
ribosome-bound preinitiation complex (summary by Jennings and Pavitt,
2010). Jennings and Pavitt (2010) defined new regulatory functions of
EIF5 in the recycling of EIF2 from its inactive EIF2-GDP state between
successive rounds of translation initiation. First, the authors showed
that EIF5 stabilizes the binding of GDP to EIF2 and is therefore a
bifunctional protein that acts as a GDP dissociation inhibitor (GDI).
Jennings and Pavitt (2010) found that this activity is independent of
the GAP function and identified conserved residues within EIF5 that are
necessary for this role. In addition, Jennings and Pavitt (2010) showed
that EIF5 is a critical component of the EIF2(alpha-P) regulatory
complex that inhibits the activity of the guanine-nucleotide exchange
factor (GEF) EIF2B (603908). Jennings and Pavitt (2010) concluded that
their findings defined a new step in the translation initiation pathway,
one that is critical for normal translational controls.

MAPPING

Hartz (2010) mapped the EIF5 gene to chromosome 14q32.32 based on an
alignment of the EIF5 sequence (GenBank GENBANK U494936) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

123940	TITLE *123940 KERATIN 4; KRT4
;;K4;;
CYTOKERATIN 4; CYK4
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Intermediate filaments are protein polymers which, together with actin
filaments and microtubules, form the cytoskeleton of cells. In
epithelial cells the intermediate filaments are made up of keratins, a
large family of related polypeptides whose patterns of expression vary
with cell type as well as with stage of epithelial differentiation. The
more than 20 different keratins encoded by at least as many
differentially expressed genes in humans (see review by Fuchs, 1988) can
be subdivided into 2 classes: type I keratins (K10-K19) are small
(40-56.5 kD) and relatively acidic (pI = 4.5-5.5), whereas type II
keratins (K1-K9) are larger (53-68 kD) and more basic (pI = 5.5-7.5).
Filament formation usually requires expression of keratins in pairs
consisting of 1 type I and 1 type II polypeptide. The specific keratins
expressed characterize the type of epithelial differentiation. For
example, K5 (148040) and K14 (148066) are synthesized in the basal cell
layer of all stratified squamous epithelia, while, in the course of
stratification, terminally differentiating epidermal cells express K1
(139350) and K10 (148080), and suprabasal cells (i.e., maturing cells of
nonkeratinizing squamous epithelia) express K4 and K13 (148065). Using
SDS-PAGE, Mischke et al. (1990) identified 2 electrophoretic variants of
the human keratin K4 that are expressed in squamous nonkeratinizing
epithelia lining the upper digestive tract. Based on a large population
sample, they concluded that 2 codominant alleles, a and b, are in
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and studies in 2 families confirmed the
mendelian nature of the variation. They referred to polymorphism also of
the K1 and K10 keratins of human epidermis (Mischke and Wild, 1987).

MAPPING

Using a cDNA probe in the analysis of human-hamster cell hybrid DNAs,
Romano et al. (1987, 1988) mapped the cytokeratin-4 gene to chromosome
12. Barletta et al. (1989, 1990) used in situ hybridization to
demonstrate that the cytokeratin-4 gene localizes to human chromosome
12p11.2-q11.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of 2 Scottish kindreds with white sponge nevus
(193900), Rugg et al. (1995) identified heterozygosity for a mutation in
the 1A domain of the KRT4 gene (123940.0001).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
WHITE SPONGE NEVUS
KRT4, 3-BP DEL, ASN8

In affected members of 2 Scottish kindreds with white sponge nevus
(193900), Rugg et al. (1995) used RT-PCR followed by direct sequencing
of K4 to demonstrate heterozygosity for a 3-bp deletion in the 1A
domain. This deletion occurred in a (CAA)3 repeat and resulted in
deletion of amino acid asparagine-8 in the highly conserved helix
initiation motif. This residue is conserved between all type I, type II,
and type III intermediate filament proteins and is therefore predicted
to be highly important to keratin filament assembly and/or integrity.
Affected members of the 2 kindreds were found to share a common
haplotype with 2 polymorphic flanking markers known to be physically
very close to K4 and so these families were probably related. A full
report of these findings appeared in Rugg et al. (1995); the authors
noted that this mutation in KRT4 is identical to a mutation in KRT6,
identified as the cause of pachyonychia congenita (148041.0001). Due to
common codon usage, several type II keratins possess the ACC
trinucleotide repeat and thus this may represent a mutational 'hotspot'
in these genes.

.0002
WHITE SPONGE NEVUS
KRT4, 3-BP INS, GLN153

Terrinoni et al. (2000) reported a heterozygous 3-bp insertion (ACA) in
the K4 gene in affected members of an Italian family with white sponge
nevus (193900). The insertion occurred between basepairs 458 and 459 and
resulted in the insertion of a glutamine residue between the second and
third amino acids of the helix initiation motif of the 1A alpha-helical
domain. The phenotype was considered mild, as only part of the buccal
and labial mucosa was involved.

.0003
WHITE SPONGE NEVUS
KRT4, GLU449LYS

In a Taiwanese patient with white sponge nevus (193900), Chao et al.
(2003) found a heterozygous 1345G-A transition in the KRT4 gene,
resulting in a glu449-to-lys (E449K) amino acid change in the 2B domain
of the K4 polypeptide.

609768	TITLE *609768 BIOGENESIS OF LYSOSOME-RELATED ORGANELLES COMPLEX 1, SUBUNIT 2; BLOC1S2
;;BLOC1, SUBUNIT 2; BLOS2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

BLOC1S2 is a component of the ubiquitously expressed BLOC1 multisubunit
protein complex. BLOC1 is required for normal biogenesis of specialized
organelles of the endosomal-lysosomal system, such as melanosomes and
platelet dense granules (Starcevic and Dell'Angelica, 2004).

CLONING

Using the BLOC1 subunit pallidin (PLDN; 604310) as bait in a yeast
2-hybrid screen of a HeLa cell cDNA library, Starcevic and Dell'Angelica
(2004) cloned BLOC1S2, which they called BLOS2. The deduced BLOS2
protein contains coiled-coil regions and has a calculated molecular mass
of 16 kD. Western blot analysis detected endogenous HeLa cell BLOS2 at
an apparent molecular mass of 18 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

By mass spectrometry of BLOC1 proteins purified from bovine liver, mouse
liver, and HeLa cells, Starcevic and Dell'Angelica (2004) identified
BLOS2 as a subunit of BLOC1. Other BLOC1 subunits identified were
pallidin, muted (607289), dysbindin (DTNBP1; 607145), cappuccino
(605695), snapin (SNAPAP; 607007), BLOC1S1 (601444), and BLOC1S3
(609762). Coimmunoprecipitation and yeast 2-hybrid analyses confirmed
that these proteins interact within the BLOC1 complex.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the BLOC1S2
gene to chromosome 10 (TMAP RH47426).

126452	TITLE *126452 DOPAMINE RECEPTOR D4; DRD4
;;D4DR
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

DRD4 is a G protein-coupled receptor that belongs to the dopamine
D2-like receptor family. Functionally, the D2-like receptors are
characterized by their ability to inhibit adenylyl cyclase (Oldenhof et
al., 1998).

CLONING

Van Tol et al. (1991) cloned the gene for the human dopamine D4
receptor. DRD4 encodes a putative 387-amino acid protein with 7
transmembrane domains, a potential N-linked glycosylation site, and
several putative phosphorylation sites. It shares 28%, 41%, and 39%
sequence homology with DRD1 (126449), DRD2 (126450) and DRD3 (126451),
respectively. Northern blot analysis revealed a 5.3-kb DRD4 mRNA in a
human neuroblastoma cell line and in several regions of the brain in rat
and monkey. Relatively high levels of DRD4 were observed in the monkey
frontal cortex, midbrain area, amygdala, and medulla, with lower levels
in the basal ganglia.

Van Tol et al. (1992) identified 3 cDNA clones of DRD4 that differed
from each other in a 48-bp sequence in the putative third cytoplasmic
loop. The sequence occurred as a direct repeat sequence (D4.2), as a
4-fold repeat (D4.4), or as a 7-fold repeat (D4.7). The deduced amino
acid sequences of the clones implied the existence of 3 different forms
of the receptor with a variably sized putative third cytoplasmic loop.
In a note added in proof, Van Tol et al. (1992) stated that they had
identified 2 additional allelic forms of the DRD4 gene corresponding in
size with a 3- and 5-fold repeat sequence.

GENE STRUCTURE

Van Tol et al. (1991) determined that the DRD4 gene contains 4 exons.
Van Tol et al. (1992) identified a 48-bp sequence in exon 3 of the DRD4
gene that contained a variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR).

MAPPING

Using a probe for DRD4 that recognizes an informative HincII
polymorphism, Gelernter et al. (1991, 1992) studied linkage to DNA
markers in non-CEPH families. Linkage was found to tyrosine hydroxylase
(191290; lod = 7.4 with male and female recombination = 0.10 and 0.17,
respectively) and with the Harvey RAS oncogene (190020; lod = 11.1 with
male and female recombination = 0.02 and 0.0, respectively). Their
observations suggested that DRD4 is close to and probably distal to
HRAS, placing DRD4 in 11p15.5. By further linkage studies, Petronis et
al. (1993) determined that the DRD4 gene lies proximal to HRAS.

GENE FUNCTION

Van Tol et al. (1991) found that the affinity of DRD4 for the
antipsychotic clozapine was much higher than that of DRD2 and DRD3.

Van Tol et al. (1992) showed that expression of 3 variant forms of DRD4
showed different properties for the long form (D4.7) as contrasted with
the shorter forms with respect to clozapine and spiperone binding. They
suggested that variations in the 48-bp sequence in the third cytoplasmic
loop of DRD4 among humans may underlie individual differences in
susceptibility to neuropsychiatric disease and in responsiveness to
antipsychotic medication.

In vitro studies suggested that the receptor encoded by the DRD4 7R
allele may be subsensitive to endogenous dopamine compared with the
receptor encoded by the 2R allele (Asghari et al., 1995), although this
was apparently not due merely to the length of the third intracellular
loop (Jovanovic et al., 1999).

Seeman et al. (1993) found a selective 6-fold increase in the density of
dopamine D4 receptors in the brains of patients with schizophrenia (see
181500).

Oldenhof et al. (1998) showed that a proline-rich region within the
putative third cytoplasmic loop interacts in vitro with a variety of SH3
domain-containing proteins, including GRB2 (108355) and NCK (see
600508). Deletion of all putative SH3-binding domains in this region
resulted in constitutive internalization of the receptor.

Gong et al. (2003) described a large-scale screen to create an atlas of
CNS gene expression at the cellular level and to provide a library of
verified bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) vectors and transgenic
mouse lines that offer experimental access to CNS regions, cell classes,
and pathways. They observed that Drd4 BAC transgenic lines expressed at
high levels in the prefronal cortex. At high magnification, these cells
were identified as layer 5 pyramidal cells.

Using a yeast 2-hybrid assay, Rondou et al. (2008) showed that KLHL12
(614522) interacted with D4.2, D4.4, and D4.7, but not with other
dopamine receptors tested and not with mouse D4, which lacks the
polymorphic repeat in IC3. Domain mapping showed that the IC3 domain of
D4 and the kelch repeat domain of KLHL12 were required for the
interaction. Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that KLHL12
interacted with the CUL3 (603136) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex via direct
interaction with CUL3 and, possibly, ROC1 (RBX1; 603814). Binding of
KLHL12 to both D4 and CUL3 resulted in recruitment of D4 to the
ubiquitin ligase complex, leading to D4 ubiquitination. Knockdown of
KLHL12 in KLHL12-overexpressing HEK293 cells abolished association of D4
with CUL3, and knockdown of CUL3 decreased ubiquitination of D4.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Most of the diversity in the DRD4 gene is the result of length and
single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variation in the 48-bp VNTR in exon
3, which encodes the third intracellular loop of the receptor. Variant
alleles containing 2 (2R) to 11 (11R) repeats are found, with the
resulting proteins having 32 to 176 amino acids at this position. The
frequency of these alleles varies widely. The 7R allele, for example,
has an exceedingly low incidence in Asian populations yet a high
frequency in the Americas (Chang et al., 1996).

Chang et al. (1996) presented data that urged caution in the
interpretation of DRD4 association studies in mixed populations. They
focused particularly on the expressed polymorphism in exon 3, which may
have functional relevance. The polymorphism (an imperfect 48-bp tandem
repeat coding for 16 amino acids; alleles had been reported with 2 to 10
repeats) was found to be universal, suggesting that it is ancient and
arose before the global dispersion of modern humans. They described
diversity of allele frequencies for this expressed polymorphism among
different populations and emphasized the importance of population
considerations in the design and interpretation of association studies
using the polymorphism.

- Association with Attention Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder

Attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; 143465) is a
developmental syndrome expressed along 3 domains: inattention,
hyperactive-impulsive, and combined type. Several investigations
examined the role of the DRD4 exon 3 repeat polymorphism in ADHD. The
long 7R allele of this receptor was shown in population-based and
family-based studies (LaHoste et al., 1996; Rowe et al., 1998; Smalley
et al., 1998; Swanson et al., 1998), but not in 1 case-control design
(Castellanos et al., 1998), to be a risk factor for this disorder. In a
family-based study of the DRD4 exon 3 repeat region and ADHD, Eisenberg
et al. (2000) failed to observe preferential transmission of the DRD4 7R
allele, and there was no preferential transmission observed when
genotypes were compared. The reasons for the conflict with earlier
findings were discussed.

Swanson et al. (2000) evaluated ADHD subgroups defined by the presence
or absence of the 7R allele of the DRD4 gene, using neuropsychologic
tests with reaction time measures designed to probe attention networks
with neuroanatomic foci in D4-rich brain regions. Despite the same
severity of symptoms on parent and teacher ratings for the ADHD
subgroups, the average reaction times of the 7R-present subgroup showed
normal speed and variability of response, whereas the average reaction
times of the 7R-absent subgroup showed the expected abnormalities (slow
and variable responses). This was opposite the primary prediction of the
study. The 7R-present subgroup seemed to be free of some of the
neuropsychologic abnormalities thought to characterize ADHD. These
findings led Swanson et al. (2000) to reconceptualize the possible
association of the DRD4 gene with ADHD.

Ding et al. (2002) stated that 8 separate replications of the initial
observation of an increased frequency of the DRD4 7R alleles in ADHD
probands had been reported.

Langley et al. (2004) found that in children with ADHD, possession of
the DRD4 7R allele appeared to be associated with an inaccurate,
impulsive response style on neuropsychologic tasks that was not
explained by ADHD symptom severity. Children with the 7R allele had
significantly more incorrect responses and shorter mean reaction times
for incorrect responses, and displayed higher activity levels as
measured by actigraphy compared to children without the allele.

Lynn et al. (2005) investigated the link between ADHD in adults,
novelty-seeking temperament, and the DRD4 7R allele in 171 parents from
96 families with ADHD-affected sib pairs. Of the parents, 56 (33%) had a
lifetime history of ADHD with 28 (50%) continuing to meet DSM-IV
criteria. Novelty seeking and the 7R variant were associated with a
lifetime history of ADHD; however, novelty seeking and ADHD did not
appear to be due to the DRD4 7R variant.

Leung et al. (2005) noted that the DRD4 7R allele associated with ADHD
varies in prevalence across ethnic groups and is very low in Asian
populations. Leung et al. (2005) studied 32 Han Chinese children with a
confirmed ADHD diagnosis and normal IQ who were methylphenidate
responders and observed no evidence of 7R alleles. Instead, they found a
2-repeat (2R) allele in this clinical sample (33%) compared to
ethnically matched controls (20%) (p = 0.015). This 1.65-fold increase
in the 2R allele was close to the increase of the 7R allele observed in
ADHD children of European ancestry. Leung et al. (2005) postulated that
an increased frequency of any non-4R allele may define the association
of the DRD4 gene with ADHD.

Manor et al. (2002) noted that polymorphisms (specifically the short
exon 3 allele) of the DRD4 gene have been associated with ADHD in some
studies, but that 2 Israeli studies (Eisenberg et al., 2000; Kotler et
al., 2000) failed to observe this association. Manor et al. (2002)
studied 178 Israeli triads using the transmission disequilibrium test
(TDT). Preferential transmission of the short allele was associated with
ADHD. Study of the same triad using the Test of Variables of Attention
(TOVA) revealed that individuals with the short allele of the exon 3
repeat performed significantly worse on the TOVA measured both by errors
of commission and response time variable. A dosage effect was observed
in that increasing repeat size was accompanied by a reduced number of
errors of commission and a significant difference was observed between
the 2 versus 7 repeats.

McCracken et al. (2000) found significant preferential transmission of a
240-bp (long) allele of the DRD4 120-bp repeat promoter polymorphism
(126452.0003) in 371 children with ADHD, and further analyses
strengthened the evidence for linkage.

D'Souza et al. (2004) studied the function of the 120-bp tandem
duplication sequence of the DRD4 gene by using transient transfection in
4 human cell lines and luciferase reporter gene assays. The longer
allele had lower transcriptional activity than the shorter allele. Lower
levels of transcriptional activity observed with the long form of the
polymorphism could result in lower levels of expression of the DRD4 gene
which may affect levels of dopamine in the synaptic cleft. The authors
noted that their findings supported the hypothesis of McCracken et al.
(2000) that the 240-bp allele was a risk factor for ADHD.

The Attention Network Test (ANT) uses the flanker task to measure
conflict and shows strong activation in the dorsal anterior cingulate on
neuroimaging studies. Because the cingulate is modulated by the ventral
tegmental dopamine system, Fossella et al. (2002) tested 200 normal
individuals with the ANT and genotyped them for 4 genes related to the
dopamine system. Polymorphisms in the DRD4 and MAOA (309850) genes were
significantly related to the efficiency of conflict. To examine whether
this genetic variation contributed to differences in brain activation
within the anterior cingulate cortex, Fan et al. (2003) genotyped 16
subjects for the DRD4 and MAOA genes who had been scanned during the
ANT. In each of the 2 genes they identified a polymorphism in which
persons with the allele associated with better behavioral performance
showed significantly more activation in the anterior cingulate while
performing the ANT than those with the allele associated with worse
performance. The 2 polymorphisms were the -1217G insertion/deletion in
the upstream region of DRD4 and a 3-repeat allele of the 30-bp repeat in
the MAOA promoter (309850.0002). The results demonstrated how genetic
differences among individuals can be linked to individual differences in
neuromodulators and in the efficiency of the operation of an appropriate
attentional network.

- Association with Novelty-Seeking Personality Trait and Risk-Taking
Behavior

Human personality traits that can be reliably measured by rating scales
show a considerable heritable component. One such instrument is the
tridimensional personality questionnaire (TPQ), which was designed by
Cloninger et al. (1993) to measure 4 distinct domains of
temperament--novelty seeking (601696), harm avoidance, reward
dependence, and persistence--that are hypothesized to be based on
distinct neurochemical and genetic substrates. Cloninger et al. (1993)
proposed that individual variations in the novelty seeking trait are
mediated by genetic variability in dopamine transmission. Individuals
who score higher than average on the TPQ novelty seeking scale are
characterized as impulsive, exploratory, fickle, excitable,
quick-tempered, and extravagant, whereas those who score lower than
average tend to be reflective, rigid, loyal, stoic, slow-tempered, and
frugal.

In a study of 20 abstinent alcohol-dependent men, a significant
correlation was found between apomorphine-induced growth hormone release
and the 'novelty seeking' score of the individual (Wiesbeck et al.,
1995). This supported Cloninger's hypothesis by giving neuroendocrine
evidence that this personality dimension is related to dopaminergic
activity, albeit in the tuberoinfundibular dopaminergic system which is
not directly associated with human personality traits.

Benjamin et al. (1996) pointed out that the possibility of a causal
relationship between DRD4 and novelty seeking is supported by studies
showing that the number of exon 3 repeats can affect the binding of
ligands to the receptor; that DRD4 is expressed in limbic areas involved
in cognition and emotion; that dopamine mediates exploratory behavior in
experimental animals; that the rewarding effects of amphetamines and
cocaine are related to dopamine release; and that novelty seeking is low
in dopamine-deficient patients with Parkinson disease (168600).

In a group of 124 unrelated Israeli subjects, Ebstein et al. (1996)
showed that higher than average novelty seeking test scores were
significantly associated with a particular exonic polymorphism, the
7-repeat (7R) allele, in exon 3 of the DRD4 gene. The association of
high novelty seeking and the 7R allele was independent of ethnicity,
sex, or age of the subjects. These results were corroborated by Benjamin
et al. (1996) who investigated the relationship between DRD4 exon 3
sequence variants and personality test scores in a population of 315
mostly male sibs, other family members and individuals in the United
States. The association between long alleles of exon 3 and personality
traits related to novelty seeking was confirmed. Moreover, family
studies showed that this association is the result of genetic
transmission rather than a population stratification.

In 2 groups of Finnish subjects (193 psychiatrically screened normal
controls and 138 alcoholic offenders), Malhotra et al. (1996) determined
DRD4 genotypes and assessed novelty seeking with the TPQ. In the control
individuals, they found no significant association between novelty
seeking and the 7R allele despite similar allele frequencies and the use
of the same personality measure as employed by Ebstein et al. (1996).
The group of alcoholic offenders had significantly higher novelty
seeking than control individuals; however, Malhotra et al. (1996) could
not replicate the previous association in this group. They suggested
that DRD4 may require reevaluation as a candidate gene for personality
variation.

Gelernter et al. (1997) also could not replicate an association between
the 7-repeat allele (called DRD4*7R by them) and higher novelty seeking.
They raised the possibility that this might represent a false negative.
They concluded that if genetic variation at the DRD4 locus exerts an
effect on human novelty seeking, it is likely to be through a mutation
in linkage disequilibrium with the exon 3 VNTR rather than as a direct
consequence of that variation.

Using the Japanese version of the Temperament and Character Inventory
questionnaire, Tomitaka et al. (1999) studied the association between
novelty seeking and the long alleles of the polymorphic exon 3 repeat
sequence of DRD4 in 69 medical students and residents (average age of
25) of the Tokyo Women's Medical College Hospital. Although the long
alleles of DRD4 were low in the Japanese population, the authors found
an association between the long alleles and novelty seeking when
compared to short alleles (p less than 0.014). The scores for
exploratory excitability and extravagance were significantly higher in
subjects with the long allele.

Kluger et al. (2002) conducted a metaanalysis of 20 studies, with a
total of 3,907 individuals, involving the association between DRD4
polymorphisms and novelty seeking. Thirteen reports suggested that the
presence of longer alleles is associated with higher novelty seeking
scores and 7 reports suggested the opposite. Kluger et al. (2002)
concluded that, on average, there was no association between DRD4
polymorphism and novelty seeking (average d = 0.06, 95% CI +/- 0.09).
They found that there was true heterogeneity among the studies (i.e.,
unknown moderators exist), but that the strength of the association
between DRD4 polymorphisms and novelty seeking in the presence of any
moderator was likely to be weak. Kluger et al. (2002) also reported that
a search for moderators had not yielded any reliable explanation for the
variability among studies.

De Luca et al. (2001) presented evidence indicating that there is a
genetic influence of the DRD4 gene on human temperament at birth and at
1 month of age. On assessment at 5 months of age, differences were not
detected, denoting a strong environmental effect. De Luca et al. (2003)
presented a follow-up, assessing the previously genotyped children at 3
years of age. By this age, both positive and negative emotions were more
clearly differentiated than at 1 and 5 months of age. Moreover,
exploratory behavior was more explicit at 3 years, given the increased
competence of 3-year-old infants to explore the environment actively and
intentionally. The study corroborated only in part previous results of a
link between the DRD4 gene and human temperament. None of the
extraversion and/or exploratory behavior measures was related to the
long form of the DRD4 exon 3 repeat polymorphism, an unusually variable
repeat region in the third cytoplasmic loop of the receptor that varies
between 2 and 10 repeats in most populations and changes the length of
the receptor protein (Asghari et al., 1995).

Savitz and Ramesar (2004) reviewed the evidence that alleles of the SERT
(182138) and DRD4 genes impact variations in personality. They argued
for the existence of a genuine effect: a gene-personality relationship
rendered periodically latent through genetic epistasis, gene-environment
interactions, variation in genetic background, and the presence of other
variables.

In a study of financial risk taking of 94 young men assessed through a
game with real monetary payoffs, Dreber et al. (2009) found an
association between the 7R allele polymorphism in the DRD4 gene and
increased financial risk-taking (see 601696). The DRD4 polymorphism was
estimated to account for about 20% of the heritable variation in
financial risk-taking. The findings were consistent with evolutionary
selection for this allele for behaviors associated with migration and
male competition, which entail an element of risk.

Among 65 individuals, Kuhnen and Chiao (2009) found that carriers of the
DRD4 7R allele took 25% more risk in a financial investment risk game
compared to individuals lacking the 7R allele. The authors speculated
that financial risk-taking may result from evolutionarily adaptive
mechanisms that encourage novelty-seeking behavior.

- Association with Alcoholism

The ALDH2*2 allele of the aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 gene (100650.0001) is
considered to be a genetic deterrent for alcoholism; however, Muramatsu
et al. (1996) found that 80 of 655 Japanese alcoholics had the mutant
allele. They postulated that these alcoholics had some other factor
which overcame the adverse effects of acetaldehydemia and that this
factor might reside in the 'reward system' of the brain in which
dopamine plays a crucial role. Therefore, Muramatsu et al. (1996)
studied variation at the DRD4 locus and found in the alcoholics a higher
frequency of a 5-repeat (5R) allele of the DRD4 receptor 48-bp repeat
polymorphism in alcoholics with ALDH2*2 than in 100 other alcoholics and
144 controls. They found that alcoholics with the 5R allele also abused
other drugs more often.

- Association with Mood Disorders

Using the Cockrane Review Manager, Lopez Leon et al. (2005) conducted a
metaanalysis to reevaluate the role of DRD4 polymorphisms in mood
disorders. In 917 patients with unipolar or bipolar affective disorder
(see 125480) and 1,164 control individuals from 12 samples, an
association was found between the DRD4 2R allele and unipolar depression
(p less than 0.001) and unipolar and bipolar depression combined (p less
than 0.001).

EVOLUTION

The 48-bp tandem repeat polymorphism in the coding region of DRD4 shows
4 repeats (4R) as the most common allele, with rarer variants containing
2 to 11 repeats (Chang et al., 1996). Ding et al. (2002) showed by DNA
resequencing and haplotyping of 600 DRD4 alleles, representing a
worldwide population sample, that the origin of the 2R to 6R alleles can
be explained by simple 1-step recombination/mutation events. In
contrast, the 7R allele is not simply related to the other common
alleles, differing by greater than 6 recombinations/mutations. Strong
linkage disequilibrium was found between the 7R allele and surrounding
DRD4 polymorphisms, suggesting that this allele is at least 5- to
10-fold 'younger' than the common 4R allele. Based on an observed bias
toward nonsynonymous amino acid changes, the unusual DNA sequence
organization, and the strong linkage disequilibrium surrounding the DRD4
7R allele, Ding et al. (2002) proposed that this allele originated as a
rare mutational event that nevertheless increased to high frequency in
human populations by positive selection. Ding et al. (2002) estimated
that the 7R allele may have originated approximately 40,000 years ago
and that the appearance of radical new technology and/or the development
of agriculture could be related to the increase in DRD4 7R allele
frequency. They suggested that individuals with personality traits such
as novelty seeking may have driven the expansion. In discussing why the
7R allele is associated with ADHD, Ding et al. (2002) speculated that
the very traits that may be selected for in individuals possessing this
allele may predispose to behaviors that are deemed inappropriate in the
typical classroom setting.

To estimate directly haplotype diversity, Wang et al. (2004) resequenced
the entire DRD4 locus from 103 individuals homozygous for 2R, 4R, or 7R
variants of the 48-bp tandem repeat DNA from individuals of African,
European, Asian, North and South American, and Pacific Island ancestry
were used. 4R/4R homozygotes exhibited little linkage disequilibrium
(LD) over the region examined, with more polymorphisms observed in DNA
samples from African individuals. In contrast, the evidence for strong
LD surrounding the 7R allele is dramatic, with all 7R/7R individuals
(including those from Africa) exhibiting the same alleles at most
polymorphic sites. By intraallelic comparison at 18 high heterozygosity
sites spanning the locus, they estimated that the 7R allele arose before
the upper Paleolithic era (approximately 40,000-50,000 years ago).
Further, the pattern of recombination at these polymorphic sites is the
pattern expected for selection acting at the 7R VNTR itself, rather than
at an adjacent site. Wang et al. (2004) proposed a model for selection
at the DRD4 locus consistent with these observed LD patterns and with
the known biochemical and physiologic differences between receptor
variants.

Harpending and Cochran (2002) commented extensively on the mechanisms by
which the increased frequency of the 7R allele might have occurred.

ANIMAL MODEL

By homologous recombination, Rubinstein et al. (1997) created mice
lacking the dopamine D4 receptor. Mutant mice were less active than
wildtype controls in open field tests in both novel and familiar
environments. However, mutant mice outperformed wildtype mice on the
rotarod and displayed locomotor supersensitivity to ethanol, cocaine,
and methamphetamine. Biochemical analyses indicated that dopamine
synthesis and its conversion to DOPAC were elevated in the dorsal
striatum of mutant mice. Rubinstein et al. (1997) proposed that DRD4
modulates normal, coordinated, and drug-stimulated motor behaviors as
well as the activity of nigrostriatal dopamine neurons.

Using an in silico search, followed by PCR, Hejjas et al. (2007)
identified VNTR polymorphisms in genes of the dopaminergic system in 4
dog breeds and European gray wolves. Polymorphisms of the DRD4, DBH
(609312), and DAT (SLC6A3; 126455) genes were associated with attention
deficit, but not activity-impulsivity, in Belgian Tervuerens, a breed
that had almost all genetic variants identified.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM DYSFUNCTION
DRD4, 13-BP DEL, NT235

Nothen et al. (1994) identified a null mutation in the first exon of the
DRD4 gene, predicted to result in a truncated nonfunctional protein. The
mutation consisted of a 13-bp deletion of bases 235 to 247. The deletion
was situated in the second transmembrane domain and included asp80,
which is highly conserved within the family of catecholaminergic
receptors and is postulated to act as counterion in catecholamine
binding. The deletion altered the reading frame from amino acid 79 and
generated a new stop codon 20 amino acids downstream. The mRNA was
predicted to code for an aberrant protein of 98 amino acids with a
calculated molecular mass of 11 kD. The frequency of the deletion was
found to be about 2% in the general population. The distribution of the
mutation was found to be similar in healthy controls and patients
suffering from psychiatric illnesses which included schizophrenia,
bipolar affective disorder, and Tourette syndrome, indicating that
heterozygosity for this mutation is not causally related to major
psychiatric diseases. However, Nothen et al. (1994) identified an adult
male who was homozygous for the mutation. He showed no symptoms of major
psychiatric illness but displayed somatic ailments including acoustic
neurinoma, obesity, and some disturbances of the autonomic nervous
system. Some of these symptoms might be related to the absence of
functional DRD4 protein. The homozygous male was 50 years old at the
time of study, had 4 children, and worked successfully as an engineer.
Autonomic hyperactivity included severe dermatographism and excessive
sweating, which occurred mainly during moderately warm temperatures and
in social gatherings. The proband denied feelings of anxiety in these
situations. Frequent fluctuations of pulse rate leading to intermittent
sinus tachycardia and necessitating medication with a beta blocker had
been recognized over the previous 10 years. A left-sided acoustic
neurinoma (family history negative) had been operated on when he was 38;
a second operation for recurrence was required 6 years later. He had
been obese since adolescence. A reduced body temperature had repeatedly
been measured (35.4 degrees C rectally).

DOPAMINE RECEPTOR D4 POLYMORPHISM
DRD4, VAL194GLY

Seeman et al. (1994) found a val194-to-gly variant of the dopamine D4
receptor in 12.5% of 186 Afro-Caribbeans but in none of 147 Caucasians
tested. This variant, present in heterozygotes, was not associated with
schizophrenia or any obvious dopamine-based disease. The amino acid
substitution resulted from a T-to-G transversion. The amino acid
replacement is 1 amino acid away from a serine that is critical for
dopamine binding in the dopamine D2 receptor (126450). Liu et al. (1996)
reported that the val194-to-gly DRD4 variant is 2 orders of magnitude
less sensitive to dopamine, clozapine, and olanzapine than the normal
receptor. The variant receptor was insensitive to guanine nucleotide,
indicating the absence of a high-affinity state or functional state.
They described a 15-year-old individual homozygous for this variant, who
also had sickle cell disease. The patient had low weight and no axillary
or pubic hair.

ATTENTION DEFICIT-HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
DRD4, 120-BP INS

Seaman et al. (1999) identified a polymorphic tandem duplication of 120
bp located 1.2 kb upstream of the initiation codon of the DRD4 gene.
McCracken et al. (2000) analyzed the DRD4 120-bp repeat promoter
polymorphism in 371 children with attention deficit-hyperactivity
disorder (143465) using the transmission disequilibrium test. The
results showed a significant preferential transmission of the 240-bp
(long) allele with ADHD, and further analyses strengthened the evidence
for linkage.

Kustanovich et al. (2004) genotyped a large multiplex sample of
ADHD-affected children and their parents for polymorphisms in genes
reported to be associated with ADHD, including DRD4, and analyzed the
results using the transmission disequilibrium test. The DRD4 120-bp
insertion/deletion promoter polymorphism displayed a significant bias
for transmission of the insertion. The DRD4 240-bp allele showed a
significant association with ADHD in this sample, with an estimated
genotype relative risk of 1.37.

In 2 independent population samples from North and South India, Juyal et
al. (2006) found a significant association between Parkinson disease
(PD; 168600) and the 120-bp duplication polymorphism (dup). Allelic
analysis of 147 PD patients and 130 controls in the South Indian group
yielded an odds ratio for disease development of 0.67 for the dup allele
and 1.48 for the wildtype allele.

602145	TITLE *602145 PROLIFERATION-ASSOCIATED 2G4, 38-KD; PA2G4
;;ERBB3-BINDING PROTEIN 1; EBP1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The mouse Pa2g4 gene was isolated by Radomski and Jost (1995) by
screening a cDNA expression library from a murine macrophage cell line
with the antibody mAb2G4. This monoclonal antibody was generated against
a single-stranded DNA-binding protein to identify proteins showing cell
cycle specific variation in nuclear localization. The protein encoded by
Pa2g4, p38-2G4, was shown to be confined to the nucleus during
interphase and early prophase, but distributed throughout the cytoplasm
from metaphase through to telophase. In addition, p38-2G4 was found to
be highly expressed between G1 and mid-S phase, decreasing toward the
end of S phase and ceasing at the S/G2 transition. As the protein is
expressed in response to mitogen stimulation, it may belong to a large
family of cell cycle regulatory proteins or replication proteins that
maintain the cell cycle activities of proliferating cells. It appears to
be a proliferation-dependent gene that probably encodes a nuclear
DNA-binding protein involved in the control of cell replication.

Lamartine et al. (1997) isolated and characterized human PA2G4. A cDNA
of 1,697 nucleotides was predicted to encode a protein of 394 amino
acids. The deduced amino acid sequence of this human protein showed very
strong homology to the mouse protein p38-2G4.

Liu et al. (2006) identified isoforms of Ebp1 with apparent molecular
masses of 48 and 42 kD by SDS-PAGE in the rat PC12 pheochromocytoma cell
line. The 48-kD isoform (p48) localized to both the cytoplasm and
nucleus of PC12 cells, whereas the 42-kD isoform (p42) was predominantly
localized in the cytoplasm.

GENE FUNCTION

Liu et al. (2006) found that the p48 isoform of Ebp1 suppressed
apoptosis in rat PC12 cells, whereas the cytoplasmic p42 isoform
promoted cell differentiation. EGF (131530) stimulated p42 to bind ERBB3
(190151) in transfected human embryonic kidney cells, and the
association depended on PKC (see PRKCA; 176960)-mediated phosphorylation
of p42. p48 did not bind ERBB3 regardless of EGF treatment.
Overexpression of p48 induced PC12 cell proliferation, which was
inhibited by p42. Nerve growth factor (NGFB; 162030) elicited extensive
sprouting in p42-transfected PC12 cells, whereas p48 induced only modest
neurite outgrowth. Akt (AKT1; 164730) was more active in p48 cells than
in p42 cells. Liu et al. (2006) concluded that EBP1 may regulate cell
survival and differentiation through 2 distinctive isoforms.

MAPPING

Lamartine et al. (1997) concluded that PA2G4 belongs to a gene family
with members in several chromosome regions: 3q24-q25, 6q22, 9q21, 12q13,
18q12, 20p12, and Xq25. They suggested that the human PA2G4 cDNA they
analyzed probably corresponds to a functional copy at chromosome 12q13.

608453	TITLE *608453 CAS-BR-M MURINE ECOTROPIC RETROVIRAL TRANSFORMING SEQUENCE C; CBLC
;;CBL3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CBL proteins, such as CBLC, are phosphorylated upon activation of a
variety of receptors that signal via protein tyrosine kinases. Through
interactions with proteins containing SRC (190090) homology-2 (SH2) and
SH3 domains, CBL proteins modulate downstream cell signaling (Keane et
al., 1999).

CLONING

By searching an EST database for CBL-like sequences, followed by
screening a pancreas carcinoma cell line cDNA library and 5-prime RACE,
Keane et al. (1999) cloned CBLC, which they designated CBL3. The deduced
474-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 52.5 kD. CBLC
contains an N-terminal phosphotyrosine-binding domain, a conserved C3HC4
zinc finger motif, and a short proline-rich region near the C terminus.
CBLC lacks the extensive proline-rich domain and leucine zipper motif
found in CBL (165360) and CBLB (604491). Keane et al. (1999) also
identified a splice variant that encodes a protein with a 46-amino acid
deletion in the phosphotyrosine-binding domain; this protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 47.5 kD. Northern blot analysis detected a
1.7- to 2.0-kb transcript expressed at high levels in liver, pancreas,
small intestine, colon, prostate, and trachea. Low expression was
detected in stomach, lung, and thyroid, and no expression was detected
in hematopoietic tissues. RNA dot blot analysis detected low but
ubiquitous expression, with highest levels in adrenal gland and salivary
gland in addition to the tissues identified by Northern blot analysis.

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to CBL, followed by
screening a kidney cDNA library and oligo capping to extend the 5-prime
sequence, Kim et al. (1999) cloned CBLC. Northern blot analysis detected
a 2.0-kb transcript highly expressed in colon and small intestine.
Expression was also observed in pancreas, placenta, liver, kidney, and
prostate, but not in brain, testis, and lymphoid tissues. Minor
transcripts of 4.0 and 6.0 kb were also detected in several tissues.
Western blot analysis found that endogenous CBLC migrated with an
apparent molecular mass of 52 kD in colon carcinoma cell lines.

Griffiths et al. (2003) found that mouse Cblc was expressed in
epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal tract, the epidermis, and the
respiratory, urinary, and reproductive systems.

GENE FUNCTION

By in vitro protein binding assays, Keane et al. (1999) determined that
both the long (CBLC-L) and short (CBLC-S) forms of CBLC bound to
recombinant fusion proteins containing the SH3 domains of LYN (165120)
and CRK (164762), but not with any other SH3-containing proteins.
Following EGF (131530) stimulation of cotransfected embryonic kidney
cells, CBLC-L, but not CBLC-S, was phosphorylated and immunoprecipitated
with EGFR (131550). CBLC-L also inhibited EGF-induced stimulation of
transcription by ERK2 (MAPK1; 176948) in a dose-dependent manner. CBLC-S
had no effect on MAPK signaling.

Kim et al. (1999) transfected embryonic kidney cells with CBLC and EGFR.
The amount of EGFR that coimmunoprecipitated with CBLC increased
following EGF stimulation. In vitro binding assays showed that CBLC
bound to the SH3 domain, but not the SH2 domain, of FYN (137025), and it
bound to the SH3 domain of GRB2 (108355) and the p85 regulatory subunit
of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (171833). CBLC and FYN
coimmunoprecipitated in transfected embryonic kidney cells only when
both proteins were present.

GENE STRUCTURE

Nau and Lipkowitz (2003) determined that the CBLC gene contains 11 exons
and spans about 23 kb. The mouse Cblc gene contains 10 exons and lacks
the intron that exists between human exons 8 and 9.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid analysis and radiation hybrid analysis, Keane et
al. (1999) mapped the CBLC gene to chromosome 19q13.2. Using FISH, Kim
et al. (1999) mapped the CBLC gene to chromosome 19q13.2-q13.3. Southern
blot analysis indicated that CBLC is a single copy gene.

ANIMAL MODEL

Griffiths et al. (2003) found that Cblc-null mice were viable, healthy,
and fertile, and displayed no histologic abnormalities up to 18 months
of age. Proliferation of epithelial cells in the epidermis and
gastrointestinal tracts was unaffected by the loss of Cblc. Moreover,
Cblc was not required for attenuation of EGF-stimulated ERK activation
in primary keratinocytes.

;;TBP1-INTERACTING PROTEIN; TBPIP;;
GT198;;
HOP2, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; HOP2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The PSMC3IP gene encodes a nuclear, tissue-specific protein with
multiple functions, including a role in meiotic recombination and as a
coactivator of ligand-dependent transcription mediated by nuclear
hormone receptors (summary by Zangen et al., 2011).

CLONING

By sequencing putative genes centromeric to the BRCA1 gene (113705) on
chromosome 17, followed by screening a breast cancer cell line cDNA
library, Rommens et al. (1995) cloned GT198. The deduced protein
contains 203 amino acids. Northern blot analysis detected a 1.6-kb
transcript in all adult and fetal tissues examined, with abundant
expression in testis, colon, a breast cancer cell line, and a lymphoma.

Tanaka et al. (1997) cloned Gt198, which they called Tbpip, from a mouse
testis cDNA library. The deduced 217-amino acid protein has several
putative phosphorylation sites. RT-PCR detected Tbpip expression in CD4
(186940)-positive T cells and in macrophages. In situ hybridization
found Tbpip mRNA colocalized with Tbp1 (186852) in seminiferous tubules
of adult mouse testis. Western blot analysis detected Tbpip at an
apparent molecular mass of 24 kD. Immunohistochemical analysis of mouse
testis detected Tbpip in nuclei of primary and secondary spermatocytes.

By PCR using primers designed from mouse Tbpip, Ijichi et al. (2000)
cloned full-length human TBPIP from breast cancer cell line mRNA and a
testis cDNA library. The deduced 217-amino acid protein contains an
acidic region near the C terminus and several putative phosphorylation
sites. Mouse and human TBPIP share 88% amino acid homology.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Rommens et al. (1995) mapped the TBPIP
gene to chromosome 17q21. Using radiation hybrid analysis, Ijichi et al.
(2000) mapped the TBPIP gene to chromosome 17q12-q21.

GENE FUNCTION

The human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) regulatory protein Tat is
essential for HIV-1 gene expression and replication in infected cells.
TBP1 is a cellular protein that suppresses Tat-mediated transactivation
of HIV replication. Tanaka et al. (1997) found that mouse Tbpip
synergistically cooperated with Tbp1 to suppress Tat-mediated
transactivation of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat promoter.

Ijichi et al. (2000) showed that human TBPIP interacted directly with
TBP1 and enhanced TBP1-mediated inhibition of HIV Tat-mediated
transactivation.

Enomoto et al. (2006) demonstrated that coexpression of human MND1
(611422) and HOP2 in E. coli resulted in the formation of stable
heterodimers. The HOP2-MND1 complex stimulated DMC1 (602721)- and RAD51
(179617)-mediated DNA strand exchange, and preferentially bound to a
3-stranded DNA branch, which mimics the strand-exchange intermediate.
Enomoto et al. (2006) concluded that the HOP2-MND1 complex may ensure
proper pairing between homologous chromosomes by stimulating strand
exchange during meiosis.

Chi et al. (2007) found that the Hop2 component of the mouse recombinant
Hop2-Mnd1 complex was the major DNA-binding subunit, and that Mnd1 was
the Rad51-interacting entity. Hop2-Mnd1 stabilized the
Rad51-single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) nucleoprotein filament, and enhanced
the ability of the Rad51-ssDNA nucleoprotein filament to capture duplex
DNA, which is an obligatory step in the formation of the synaptic
complex critical for DNA joint formation. Pezza et al. (2007) showed
that the mouse Hop2-Mnd1 complex stimulated Dmc1 to promote synaptic
complex formation on long duplex DNAs. Synaptic alignment was a
consequence of the ability of Hop2-Mnd1 to stabilize the Dmc1-ssDNA
nucleoprotein complex and facilitate the conjoining of DNA molecules
through the capture of double-stranded DNA by the Dmc1-ssDNA
nucleoprotein filament.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a large consanguineous Arab Palestinian pedigree with
hypergonadotropic ovarian dysgenesis mapping to chromosome 17 (ODG3;
614324), Zangen et al. (2011) analyzed candidate genes and identified
homozygosity for a 3-bp deletion in the PSMC3IP gene (608665.0001) that
segregated with disease in the family. In cell lines, the glu201del
mutation abolished PSMC3IP activation of estrogen-driven transcription.

ANIMAL MODEL

Petukhova et al. (2003) found that Hop2 knockout mice showed no gross
anomalies in somatic tissues but developed a profound deficiency in
gametogenesis. Hop2 -/- spermatocytes arrested at the stage of
pachytene-like chromosome condensation. Axial elements were fully
developed, but synapsis was limited. While meiotic double-stranded
breaks were formed and processed in Hop2 -/- mice, they failed to be
repaired.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
OVARIAN DYSGENESIS 3
PSMC3IP, 3-BP DEL, 600GAG

In affected members of a large consanguineous Arab Palestinian pedigree
with hypergonadotropic ovarian dysgenesis (ODG3; 614324), Zangen et al.
(2011) identified homozygosity for an in-frame 3-bp deletion in the
acceptor splice junction of exon 8 of the PSMC3IP gene, resulting in
deletion of glu201. The unaffected parents were heterozygous for the
deletion, which was not found in 254 ethnically matched chromosomes.
RT-PCR analysis of leukocyte DNA from affected and unaffected family
members showed no alternative splicing, suggesting that the mutation
does not affect PSMC3IP splicing. Transfection studies in the IGROV1
ovarian carcinoma and MCF7 breast cancer cell lines demonstrated that
the glu201del mutation abolished PSMC3IP activation of estrogen-driven
transcription.

610497	TITLE *610497 BRAIN AND REPRODUCTIVE ORGAN-EXPRESSED PROTEIN; BRE
;;BRCC4;;
BRCC45
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Li et al. (1995) cloned BRE from a placenta cDNA library. The deduced
protein contains 383 amino acids. Northern blot analysis of normal human
fibroblasts detected a single BRE mRNA at 1.7 to 1.9 kb. Northern blot
analysis of several rat tissues detected highest expression in testis
and intermediate expression in brain and ovary. Using the juxtamembrane
domain of the p55 TNF receptor (TNFRSF1A; 191190) as bait in a yeast
2-hybrid screen, Gu et al. (1998) cloned Bre from a mouse cerebellum
cDNA library.

GENE FUNCTION

Li et al. (1995) found that the expression of BRE decreased following
DNA damage in normal human fibroblasts caused by UV irradiation or
4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4NQO) exposure. Similar decreased BRE
expression was observed in retinoic acid-treated human brain glioma
cells and promyelocytic cells. BRE expression was unchanged in cells
following growth inhibition.

Using protein-binding assays and immunoprecipitation analysis in HEK293
cells, Gu et al. (1998) confirmed the interaction between mouse Bre and
Tnfrsf1a. Bre specifically interacted with Tnfrsf1a but not with other
TNF family members. Overexpression of Bre inhibited TNF-induced
NF-kappa-B activation.

Dong et al. (2003) demonstrated that in human cell lines BRE and BRCC3
(300617) are components of a holoenzyme complex containing BRCA1
(113705), BRCA2 (600185), BARD1 (601593), and RAD51 (179617), which they
called the BRCA1- and BRCA2-containing complex (BRCC). The complex
showed UBC5 (see UBE2D1; 602961)-dependent ubiquitin E3 ligase activity.
Inclusion of BRE and BRCC3 enhanced ubiquitination by the complex, and
cancer-associated truncations in BRCA1 reduced the association of BRE
and BRCC3 with the complex. RNA interference of BRE and BRCC3 in HeLa
cells increased cell sensitivity to ionizing radiation and resulted in a
defect in G2/M checkpoint arrest. Dong et al. (2003) concluded that the
BRCC is a ubiquitin E3 ligase that enhances cellular survival following
DNA damage.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the BRE
gene to chromosome 2 (TMAP RH66226).

610607	TITLE *610607 CYTOPLASMIC POLYADENYLATION ELEMENT-BINDING PROTEIN 4; CPEB4
;;CPE-BINDING PROTEIN 4;;
KIAA1673
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Cytoplasmic polyadenylation elements (CPEs) are located in the 3-prime
UTRs of hundreds of mRNAs involved in cell proliferation, chromosome
segregation, and cell differentiation. CPEs function as docking sites
for CPE-binding proteins (CPEBs), which can either repress or activate
mRNA translation. CPEB4 activates mRNA translation by adding poly(A)
tails to target mRNAs (Ortiz-Zapater et al., 2012).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned CPEB4, which they designated
KIAA1673. The deduced 712-amino acid protein shares significant identity
with mouse Cpeb1 (607342). RT-PCR ELISA detected intermediate to high
expression of CPEB4 in all tissues examined, with highest levels in
brain, kidney, heart, and fetal liver. CPEB4 was expressed in all
specific adult brain regions examined, with highest levels in
cerebellum, spinal cord, caudate nucleus, hippocampus, and substantia
nigra.

GENE FUNCTION

Ortiz-Zapater et al. (2012) observed increased expression of CPEB4 in
several human pancreatic tumor cell lines and in pancreatic tumor tissue
compared with a nontumorigenic pancreatic cell line and normal pancreas,
respectively. CPEB4 expression was also absent in normal astrocytes but
abundant in high-grade gliomas. Knockdown of CPEB4 expression in RWP-1
and Capan-1 human pancreatic tumor cells and in T98G glioblastoma cells
reduced invasiveness in vitro and malignancy and mortality following
injection into nude mice. Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that
CPEB4 associated with a large number of CPE-containing mRNAs in RWP-1
cells, with most significant enrichment in mRNAs encoding general
translation factors and ribosomal proteins. One of these mRNAs, TPA
(PLAT; 173370), contains 2 CPEs in its 3-prime UTR. In normal pancreas,
TPA mRNA had a short poly(A) tail, but in pancreatic cancers, TPA mRNA
had a long poly(A) tail that was associated with upregulated TPA protein
expression. Downregulation of CPEB4 in RWP-1 cells resulted in TPA mRNAs
with shorter poly(A) tails and reduced TPA protein expression.
Ortiz-Zapater et al. (2012) concluded that TPA mRNA is translationally
activated in tumors through recruitment of CPEB4 to CPEs in its 3-prime
UTR.

MAPPING

Using a human-rodent hybrid panel, Nagase et al. (2000) mapped the CPEB4
gene to chromosome 5.

proteins requires cis-acting peroxisomal targeting signals (PTSs), the 2
best-characterized being PTS1 and PTS2 (Subramani, 1993). The C-terminal
PTS1 motif is present on most peroxisomal matrix proteins and is found
in mammals, insects, plants, yeast, and protozoans. In mammals, the
consensus PTS1 is ser-lys-leu-COOH, but some variability is allowed,
with ala or cys also possible at the -3 position; arg or his at the -2
position; and met at the -1 position. PTS1-mediated peroxisomal protein
import requires ATP and one or more cytosolic factors, and is stimulated
by HSP70 heat-shock proteins. PTS2, which has been identified in only a
few proteins (peroxisomal thiolase from numerous species, a glyoxysomal
malate dehydrogenase from watermelon, and human phytanic acid oxidase),
is located within 40 amino acids of the N terminus and has a consensus
of arg/lys-leu-X5-gln/his-leu. Mutants deficient in peroxisome assembly,
previously called pas mutants and now known as pex mutants, have been
identified in several yeast species. Among the 10 or more
complementation groups of pas mutants in the yeast Pichia pastoris, the
phenotype of the pas8 mutant is unique in that it displays a selective
defect in the import of PTS1 proteins. PAS8 encodes a 68-kD protein with
multiple tetratricopeptide repeat motifs. Because of the phenotype of
the pas8 mutant and the fact that the protein that is missing in that
mutant has PTS1-binding activity in vitro, it was proposed that PAS8
encodes the PTS1 receptor of P. pastoris. Dodt et al. (1995) identified
and characterized the human gene PXR1, a homolog of P. pastoris PAS8,
and demonstrated that it is indeed the human PTS1 receptor. PXR1, like
PAS8, encodes a receptor for proteins with the type 1 peroxisomal
targeting signal (PTS1). Mutations in PXR1 define complementation group
2 of the peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs), and expression of PXR1
rescues the PTS1 import defect of fibroblasts from these patients. Based
on the observation that PXR1 exists both in the cytosol and in
association with peroxisomes, Dodt et al. (1995) proposed that PXR1
protein recognizes PTS1-containing proteins in the cytosol and directs
them to the peroxisome. In the revised nomenclature (vide infra) both
PAS8 and PXR1 are designated PEX5.

Wiemer et al. (1995) cloned a human liver cDNA encoding PEX5, which they
called PTS1R. The predicted 602-amino acid protein has a calculated
molecular mass of 67 kD but an 80-kD mass by immunoblot analysis; the
authors indicated that the discrepancy is due to aberrant migration on
SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Northern blot analysis detected an
approximately 3.4-kb transcript in all human tissues examined.

Shepard et al. (2007) identified long and short isoforms of PTS1R by
yeast 2-hybrid analysis of human trabecular meshwork and heart cell cDNA
libraries using C-terminal MYOC (601652) as bait. The long splice
variant contains 639 amino acids, and the short splice variant contains
602 amino acids.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid and fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses,
Wiemer et al. (1995) mapped the human PEX5 gene to chromosome 12p13.3.
Marynen et al. (1995) mapped the PEX5 gene to chromosome 12p13 by in
situ hybridization using a cosmid containing the gene as a probe. A
radiation hybrid DNA panel was used to map the gene between TPI1
(190450) and the marker D12S1089.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Stanley et al. (2006) solved the crystal structure of PXR1 at
2.3-angstrom resolution in the presence and absence of a cargo protein,
SCP2 (184755). PXR1 showed major structural changes from an open,
snail-like conformation in the absence of cargo into a closed, circular
conformation when bound by SCP2. These changes occurred within a long
loop C-terminal to the 7-fold tetratricopeptide repeat segments. Stanley
et al. (2006) identified residues within this loop that were critical
for in vivo cargo import, and their mutation led to defective cargo
import into peroxisomes.

GENE FUNCTION

Dammai and Subramani (2001) showed that human PEX5 does not just bind
cargo and deliver it to the peroxisome membrane, but instead
participates in multiple rounds of entry into the peroxisome matrix and
export to the cytosol independent of the PTS2 import pathway. The
authors noted that this unusual shuttling mechanism for the PTS1
receptor distinguishes protein import into peroxisomes from that into
most other organelles, with the exception of the nucleus.

Shepard et al. (2007) identified PTS1R as a binding partner for
misfolded mutant MYOC and demonstrated that glaucoma (137750)-causing
mutations in human MYOC induce exposure of a cryptic peroxisomal
targeting sequence, which must interact with PTS1R to elevate
intraocular pressure.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Dodt et al. (1995) found that of the 2 reported patients in
complementation group 2 showing mutations in PEX5, cells from the
patient homozygous for N489K (600414.0001) were defective in the import
of PTS1 proteins into peroxisomes, as expected. However, cells from the
patient homozygous for the nonsense mutation R390X (600414.0002) were
defective in the import of both PTS1 and PTS2 proteins, suggesting that
the PTS1 receptor also mediates PTS2-targeted protein import. To
investigate this possibility, Braverman et al. (1998) characterized PEX5
expression and found that it undergoes alternative splicing, producing 2
transcripts, 1 containing and 1 lacking a 111-bp internal exon.
Fibroblasts from the patient with the nonsense mutation had greatly
reduced levels of PEX5 transcript and protein as compared with the
patient with the missense mutation N489K. Transfection of the R390X
cells with PEX5 cDNA lacking the 1 exon restored PTS1 but not PTS2
import; transfection with the long form of PEX5 cDNA restored both PTS1
and PTS2 protein import. Furthermore, transfection of the R390X cells
with PEX5 cDNAs containing the mutations, which are located downstream
of the additional exon, restored PTS2 but not PTS1 import. Taken
together, these data provided an explanation for the different protein
import defects in CG2 patients and showed that the long isoform of the
PEX5 protein is required for peroxisomal import of PTS2 proteins.

ANIMAL MODEL

Patients with Zellweger syndrome have an inability to assemble
functional peroxisomes, resulting in a multiorgan defect during fetal
development and death, usually within the first year of life. Patients
suffer from extreme hypotonia, neonatal seizures, and severe mental
retardation and accumulate very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs),
pristanic acid, phytanic acid, and bile acid intermediates. At the time
of death, liver fibrosis, renal cysts, and severe brain malformations
are among the most prominent organ abnormalities. The thin cortical
plates and subcortical heterotopias are attributed to a partial
impediment to gliophilic neuronal migration. To investigate the
pleiotropic role of peroxisomes in vivo, Baes et al. (1997) generated an
animal model of peroxisome deficiency through inactivation of the Pxr1
gene in mice. Homozygous Pxr1 knockout mice lacked morphologically
identifiable peroxisomes and exhibited the typical biochemical
abnormalities of Zellweger patients. They displayed intrauterine growth
retardation, were severely hypotonic at birth, and died within 72 hours.
Analysis of the neocortex revealed impaired neuronal migration and
maturation and extensive apoptotic death of neurons.

NOMENCLATURE

Distel et al. (1996) provided a unified nomenclature for peroxisome
biogenesis. By the use of genetic approaches in a wide variety of
experimental organisms, 13 proteins required for peroxisome biogenesis
had been identified in the previous 10 years. Three of these had been
shown to be defective in lethal peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs).
However, the diverse experimental systems had led to a profusion of
names for peroxisome assembly genes and proteins. Distel et al. (1996)
suggested that proteins involved in peroxisome biogenesis should be
designated 'peroxins,' with PEX representing the gene acronym. Even
though defects in peroxisomal metabolic enzymes or transcription factors
may affect peroxisome proliferation and/or morphology, such proteins
should not, they recommended, be included in this group. The proteins
and genes were to be numbered by date of published characterization,
both for known factors and those identified in the future. When
necessary, species of origin could be specified by 1-letter
abbreviations for genus and species (e.g., hsPEX2).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
PEROXISOME BIOGENESIS DISORDER 2B
PEX5, ASN489LYS

In a cell line from a patient with neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy (see
PBD2B, 202370), Dodt et al. (1995) identified a specific defect in
PTS1-mediated uptake of peroxisomal proteins and examined the PXR1 gene
in this patient by RT-PCR amplification of fibroblast RNA followed by
SSCP analysis. Sequencing of an abnormally migrating fragment
demonstrated a PXR1 allele with a T-to-G transversion at basepair 1467,
producing an asn489-to-lys (N489K) substitution. The patient appeared to
be homozygous for the mutant allele, but family studies were not
performed. The N489K substitution was not found in 130 unrelated control
individuals. Transfection of the normal gene into the patient's cells
restored normal import of PTS1-containing proteins into peroxisomes, as
well as normal peroxisome morphology. In contrast, normal cells
transfected with PXR1 carrying the N489K mutation were unable to import
PTS1-containing proteins into peroxisomes. (The cells of the patient
showed normal import of the PTS2 marker protein, thiolase, into
peroxisomal structures.)

.0002
PEROXISOME BIOGENESIS DISORDER 2A (ZELLWEGER)
PEX5, ARG390TER

In a cell line from a patient with Zellweger syndrome (PBD2A; 214110),
Dodt et al. (1995) identified a C-to-T transition at nucleotide 1168
resulting in an arg390-to-ter substitution. The patient was homozygous
for the mutation.

600267	TITLE *600267 PROTEIN-TYROSINE PHOSPHATASE, NONRECEPTOR-TYPE, 13; PTPN13
;;PROTEIN-TYROSINE PHOSPHATASE PTPL1;;
FAS-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN-TYROSINE PHOSPHATASE 1; FAP1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a PCR-based approach, Saras et al. (1994) cloned a cytoplasmic
protein tyrosine phosphatase of nonreceptor type, which they designated
PTPL1. Overlapping cDNA clones encompassed an open reading frame of
7,398 bp, predicting a 2,466-amino acid protein with a molecular mass of
275 kD. PTPL1 was found to have a wide tissue distribution, a 9.5-kb
transcript being expressed in most tissues. PTPL1 has a protein-tyrosine
phosphatase domain located in the C terminus. In the nonenzymatic part
of PTPL1, 3 different structural motifs were identified; 2 of these are
often found in proteins at the interface between the plasma membrane and
the cytoskeleton, namely, a domain with similarity to the band 4.1
(130500) superfamily, and a region consisting of 5 copies of an 80-amino
acid repeat found in a variety of cytoskeleton-associated proteins. In
addition, PTPL1 has a leucine zipper motif. Saras et al. (1994) noted
that PTPL1 was the largest known PTP and the only one known to contain a
leucine zipper motif. Its structure suggests that it may be able to form
dimers and may localize to the submembranous cytoskeleton.

Both Banville et al. (1994) and Maekawa et al. (1994) isolated the same
nonreceptor-type protein-tyrosine phosphatase, PTPN13, which they
referred to as hPTP1E and PTP-BAS, respectively. Maekawa et al. (1994)
originally isolated a PCR product from basophil mRNA using degenerate
primers and RT-PCR. This was used as a probe to screen a
basophil-enriched KU812E cell cDNA library. The fully characterized cDNA
was over 8.1 kb and encoded a 2,485-amino acid predicted reading frame.
The Banville et al. (1994) cDNA was isolated by screening a ZR-75-1
breast carcinoma cell line at low stringency with a probe for LAR cDNA
(179590). The cDNA they identified was over 8.3 kb long and encoded a
2,490-amino acid reading frame. Both groups noted that the N-terminal
region contains motifs showing similarity to the GLGF motifs found in
guanylate kinase proteins that may play a role in the subcellular
distribution of these proteins within specialized structures of the cell
membrane where cell-cell interactions occur. Maekawa et al. (1994)
presented evidence for alternative splicing producing at least 3
different isoforms of PTPN13. Banville et al. (1994) expressed the
protein in E. coli and showed that the recombinant protein had the
expected protein-tyrosine phosphatase activity. Northern blot analysis
showed expression in a variety of tissues with especially high levels in
the kidney, lung, and fetal brain.

PTPN13 binds to a negative regulatory domain in Fas that inhibits
Fas-induced apoptosis; it has therefore also been called Fas-associated
protein-tyrosine-1 (FAP1) (Inazawa et al., 1996).

GENE STRUCTURE

Yoshida et al. (2002) determined that the PTPN13 gene is located only
633 bp upstream from JNK3 (602897) in a head-to-head orientation. A
short G/C-rich region between the cap sites of the 2 genes suggested
that they might share a bidirectional promoter region that appears to
contain multiple cis elements. They found that the PTPN13 gene, which
contains 48 exons, initiates transcription within exon 2 and terminates
in exon 48.

MAPPING

Banville et al. (1994) assigned the PTPN13 gene to chromosome 11 by PCR
of somatic cell hybrid DNAs. In an erratum, they stated that the gene
had been assigned to chromosome 4 and not 11 as reported.

Inazawa et al. (1996) localized the PTPN13 gene to 4q21.3 by both
fluorescence in situ hybridization and PCR analysis of somatic cell
hybrids. They noted that the 4q21.3 chromosomal region contains a gene
for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (173910) and is
frequently deleted in liver and ovarian cancers.

The assignment to 4q21 was confirmed by van den Maagdenberg et al.
(1996) who also mapped the gene to mouse chromosome 5.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Wang et al. (2004) performed a mutational analysis of the tyrosine
phosphatase gene superfamily in human cancers and identified 83 somatic
mutations in 6 protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPRF, 179590; PTPRG,
176886; PTPRT, 608712; PTPN3, 176877; PTPN13; and PTPN14, 603155),
affecting 26% of colorectal cancers and a smaller fraction of lung,
breast, and gastric cancers. Fifteen mutations were nonsense,
frameshift, or splice site alterations predicted to result in truncated
proteins lacking phosphatase activity. Wang et al. (2004) biochemically
examined 5 missense mutations in PTPRT, the most commonly altered
protein-tyrosine phosphatase, and found that they reduced phosphatase
activity. Expression of wildtype but not a mutant PTPRT in human cancer
cells inhibited cell growth. Wang et al. (2004) concluded that their
observations suggested that the mutated tyrosine phosphatases are tumor
suppressor genes, regulating cellular pathways that may be amenable to
therapeutic intervention.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The Fc receptor with low affinity for IgG (FCGR3, or CD16) is encoded by
2 nearly identical genes, FCGR3A (146740) and FCGR3B, resulting in
tissue-specific expression of alternative membrane-anchored isoforms.
FCGR3A encodes a transmembrane protein expressed on activated
monocytes/macrophages, natural killer (NK) cells, and a subset of T
cells. In contrast, FCGR3B encodes a glycosylphosphatidylinositol
(GPI)-anchored protein that is expressed constitutively by neutrophils
and after gamma-interferon (IFNG; 147570) stimulation by eosinophils
(summary by Gessner et al., 1995).

CLONING

Ory et al. (1989) reported the cDNA sequences encoding the NA1 and NA2
forms of FCGR3 on neutrophils, which are encoded by the FCGR3B gene.

By Western blot and flow cytometric analyses, Ravetch and Perussia
(1989) demonstrated differential expression of FCGR3 on
polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) and NK cells. The glycoprotein on
NK cells (FCGR3A) had a molecular mass 6 to 10 kD larger than that on
neutrophils (FCGR3B) and was resistant to phosphatidylinositol-specific
phospholipase C. Transcripts derived from FCGR3A and FCGR3B in NK cells
and PMNs, respectively, have multiple single nucleotide differences,
including 1 that converts a termination codon to a codon encoding arg,
thereby extending the cytoplasmic domain by 21 amino acids and
introducing a transmembrane anchor for FCGR3A in NK cells. The deduced
FCGR3A protein contains 254 amino acids, whereas the deduced FCGR3B
protein contains 233 amino acids. Ravetch and Perussia (1989) concluded
that cell type-specific expression of 2 genes encoding alternative FCGR3
proteins has a significant effect on the biologic functions of the
molecules.

GENE STRUCTURE

Gessner et al. (1995) isolated and sequenced genomic clones of FCGR3A
and FCGR3B, located their transcription initiation sites, identified the
different organizations of their 5-prime regions, and demonstrated 4
distinct classes of FCGR3A transcripts compared with a single class of
FCGR3B transcripts. The gene promoters displayed different
tissue-specific transcriptional activities reflecting expression of
FCGR3A in NK cells and FCGR3B in neutrophils.

MAPPING

By spot blot analysis, Grundy et al. (1989) mapped the FCGR2A (146790)
and FCGR2B genes, which are separated by about 200 kb, to chromosome 1q.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Sondermann et al. (2000) described the crystal structures of a soluble
FCGR3 (CD16B), an Fc fragment from human IgG1 (Fc1), and their complex.
In the 1:1 complex, the receptor binds to the 2 halves of the Fc
fragment in contact with residues of the C-gamma-2 domains and the hinge
region. Upon complex formation, the angle between the 2 soluble CD16B
domains increases significantly and the Fc fragment opens
asymmetrically. The high degree of amino acid conservation between
soluble CD16B and other Fc receptors, and similarly between Fc1 and
related immunoglobulins, suggested similar structures and modes of
association.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Genetic polymorphism of Fc receptor III on neutrophils is detectable by
several means, including reaction with antibodies against the biallelic
neutrophil-specific antigen system NA; differences in electrophoretic
mobility on SDS-PAGE; and differences in mRNAs encoding the allelic
forms of Fc receptor III. Ory et al. (1989) described the relationship
between structural and antigenic polymorphisms of FCGR3B and showed that
these reflect differences at the level of primary protein structure.

In a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE; 152700), Clark et
al. (1990) found that neutrophils were not recognized by either
monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies to Fc receptor III, but reacted
normally with antibodies to Fc receptor II (FCGR2A), as well as with
antibodies to complement receptor-1, complement receptor-3 (120980), and
decay-accelerating factor (DAF; 125240). Analysis of genomic DNA showed
that failure of the patient's neutrophils to express Fc receptor III was
most likely due to an abnormality of the gene encoding the receptor.

Huizinga et al. (1990) described a case of neonatal isoimmune
neutropenia in which the mother was completely lacking FcRIII (CD16) on
neutrophils, but normal expression of FcRIII on natural killer cells.
The mother had isoantibodies in her blood against CD16 antigen,
apparently produced during pregnancy and responsible for the neutropenia
in her child. Fc receptor III is encoded by 2 separate genes: FcRIII-1,
which encodes the neutrophil receptor, and FcRIII-2, which encodes the
transmembrane receptor on natural killer cells and macrophages. The
neutrophil FcRIII deficiency appeared to be due to deletion of the
FcRIII-1 gene, while the FcRIII-2 gene was normally present. Her parents
were found to be heterozygous for the defect.

Neutrophil-specific antigens have been identified in the course of study
of isoimmune neonatal neutropenia due to fetomaternal incompatibility.
(Since it occurs in multiple sibs, neonatal neutropenia might simulate a
recessive disorder.) Two loci, termed NA and NB (162860), were
identified (Lalezari and Radel, 1974), with 2 alleles known at the NA
locus. These are NA1 and NA2 and have a frequency of 0.377 and 0.633,
respectively, in Caucasians and 0.651 in 0.302, respectively, in
Japanese (Ohto and Matsuo, 1989). The 'NA-null' status of the mother
reported by Huizinga et al. (1990) indicated that CD16 and NA are the
same molecule. Fromont et al. (1992) described a healthy woman who after
multiple pregnancies developed an antibody directed against CD16 which
caused transient neonatal alloimmune neutropenia (NAIN). The woman's
polymorphonuclear leukocytes did not react with monoclonal NA1 and NA2
antibodies, indicating the NA-null phenotype. Fromont et al. (1992)
determined that in a healthy, white population of 3,377 random blood
donors there were only 4 other instances of the NA-null phenotype. Their
proposita was the only one with an allo-CD16 antibody. The gene
frequency was calculated to be 0.0274 +/- 0.0059.

The neutrophil-specific antigen NC1 was defined by an antibody (Vaz) in
the serum of a multiparous mother who gave birth to a child with
alloimmune neonatal neutropenia (Lalezari et al., 1970). This antigen
has a gene frequency of about 0.80 (Lalezari et al., 1970). NC1 was
found to be associated with the neutrophil-specific antigen NA2,
although the precise relationship of NC1 and NA2 was unclear. Using the
antigen capture assay MAIGA and the granulocyte (GIFT) and lymphocyte
(LIFT) immunofluorescence tests, Bux et al. (1995) obtained results
indicating that NC1 and NA2 antigens are identical.

Aitman et al. (2006) showed that copy number variation (CNV) of the
orthologous rat and human Fcgr3 (FCGR3A; 146740) genes is a determinant
of susceptibility to immunologically mediated glomerulonephritis.
Positional cloning identified loss of the rat-specific Fcgr3 paralog
'Fcgr3-related sequence' (Fcgr3rs) as a determinant of macrophage
overactivity and glomerulonephritis in Wistar Kyoto rats. In humans, low
copy number of FCGR3B, an ortholog of rat Fcgr3, was associated with
glomerulonephritis in the autoimmune disorder SLE. Aitman et al. (2006)
concluded that their finding that gene CNV predisposes to
immunologically mediated renal disease in 2 mammalian species provides
direct evidence for the importance of genome plasticity in the evolution
of genetically complex phenotypes, including susceptibility to common
human disease.

Following up on the study of Aitman et al. (2006) in a larger sample,
Fanciulli et al. (2007) confirmed and strengthened their previous
finding of an association between low FCGR3B copy number and
susceptibility to glomerulonephritis in SLE patients. Low copy number
was also associated with risk of systemic SLE with no known renal
involvement as well as with microscopic polyangiitis and Wegener
granulomatosis (608710), but not with organ- specific Graves disease
(275000) or Addison disease (240200), in British and French cohorts.
Fanciulli et al. (2007) concluded that low FCGR3B copy number or
complete FCGR3B deficiency has a key role in the development of specific
autoimmunity.

Willcocks et al. (2008) confirmed that low copy number of FCGR3B was
associated with SLE (152700) in a Caucasian U.K. population, but they
were unable to find an association in a Chinese population.
Investigations of the functional effects of FCGR3B CNV revealed that
FCGR3B CNV correlated with cell surface expression, soluble FCGR3B
production, and neutrophil adherence to and uptake of immune complexes
both in a patient family and in the general population. Willcocks et al.
(2008) found that individuals from 3 U.K. cohorts with antineutrophil
cytoplasmic antibody-associated systemic vasculitis (AASV) were more
likely to have high FCGR3B CNV. They proposed that FCGR3B CNV is
involved in immune complex clearance, possibly explaining the
association of low CNV with SLE and high CNV with AASV.

Among 1,115 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA; 180300) and 654
controls, Robinson et al. (2012) found a significant association between
FCGR3B deletions and disease (OR = 1.50, p = 0.028). The association was
more apparent in rheumatoid factor (RF)-positive disease (OR = 1.61, p =
0.011). Robinson et al. (2012) noted that the general association (p =
0.028) would not remain significant if corrected for multiple testing,
but the evidence was strengthened by the stronger association in the
RF-positive group of patients. The level of FCGR3B expression on
neutrophils was shown to correlate with gene copy number. The results
implicated an important role for neutrophils in the pathogenesis of RA,
potentially through reduced FCGR3B-mediated immune complex clearance.
The authors used a novel quantitative sequence variant assay in the
study.

In a metaanalysis of 8 published studies examining the association of
FCGR3B CNVs in autoimmune diseases, McKinney and Merriman (2012) found
that low (less than 2) gene copy number was associated with SLE (OR of
1.59, p = 9.1 x 10(-7)), but not with rheumatoid arthritis (OR of 1.36,
p = 0.15). A combined autoimmune phenotype analysis, including
vasculitis, ulcerative colitis (see 266600), Kawasaki disease (611775),
and other disorders, supported FCGR3B deletions as a risk factor for
non-organ-specific autoimmunity (OR = 1.44, p = 2.9 x 10(-9)). The
findings implicated defects in the clearance of immune complexes in the
etiology of non-organ-specific autoimmune disease.

Mueller et al. (2013) found that the increased risk of SLE associated
with reduced copy number of FCGR3B can be explained by the presence of a
chimeric gene, FCGR2B-prime, that occurs as a consequence of FCGR3B
deletion on FCGR3B zero-copy haplotypes. The FCGR2B-prime gene consists
of upstream elements and a 5-prime coding region that derive from FCGR2C
(612169), and a 3-prime coding region that derives from FCGR2B (604590).
The coding sequence of FCGR2B-prime is identical to that of FCGR2B, but
FCGR2B-prime would be expected to be under the control of 5-prime
flanking sequences derived from FCGR2C. Mueller et al. (2013) found by
flow cytometry, immunoblotting, and cDNA sequencing that presence of the
chimeric FCGR2B-prime gene results in the ectopic presence of
Fc-gamma-RIIb on natural killer cells, providing an explanation for SLE
risk associated with reduced FCGR3B copy number. To pursue the
underlying mechanism of SLE disease association with FCGR3B copy number
variation, Mueller et al. (2013) aligned the reference sequence (GRCh37)
of the proximal block of the FCGR locus (chr1:161,480,906-161,564,008)
to that of the distal block (chr1:161,562,570-161,645,839).
Identification of informative paralogous sequence variants (PSVs)
enabled Mueller et al. (2013) to narrow the potential breakpoint region
to a 24.5-kb region of paralogy between then 2 ancestral duplicated
blocks. The complete absence of nonpolymorphic PSVs in the 24.5-kb
region prevented more precise localization of the breakpoints in
FCGR3B-deleted or FCGR3B-duplicated haplotypes.

EVOLUTION

By determining the nature and rate of copy number variation (CNV)
mutation and investigating the global variation of disease-associated
variation at the FCGR locus, Machado et al. (2012) determined that CNV
of the FCGR3 genes is mediated by recurrent nonallelic homologous
recombination between the 2 segmental duplications that carry FCGR3A and
FCGR3B. They showed that pathogen richness, particularly helminth
pathogens, is likely to have influenced the patterns of variation in
FCGRs in humans. Machado et al. (2012) proposed that alterations to IgG
binding in the context of helminth infection have driven positive
selection in FCGR among different mammalian species, linking
evolutionary pressure of helminth infection with autoimmune disease via
adaptation at the genetic level. This model supports the 'hygiene
hypothesis,' which states that in the absence of chronic helminth
infection in modern populations, previously selected alleles respond to
immune system challenges differently and therefore may alter
susceptibility to autoimmune disease.

ANIMAL MODEL

Pinheiro da Silva et al. (2007) found that Fcrg (FCER1G; 147139) -/-
mice showed reduced mortality in an acute peritonitis model caused by
cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) compared with wildtype mice. The
reduced mortality in Fcrg -/- mice was associated with lower serum and
peritoneal Tnf (191160) and significantly increased capacity of
neutrophils and macrophages to phagocytose E. coli. Mice lacking Fcgr3
(the only Fcgr3 gene in mice) also had reduced sepsis after CLP. Fcgr3
bound E. coli, inducing Fcrg phosphorylation, recruitment of tyrosine
phosphatase Shp1 (PTPN6; 176883), and dephosphorylation of
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K; see 171834). Decreased Pi3k
activity inhibited E. coli phagocytosis and increased Tnf production
through Tlr4 (603030). Confocal microscopy demonstrated negative
regulation of Marco (604870) by Fcrg. Interaction of E. coli with Fcgr3
induced recruitment of Shp1 to Marco and inhibited E. coli phagocytosis.
Pinheiro da Silva et al. (2007) concluded that binding of E. coli to
FCGR3 triggers an inhibitory FCRG pathway that impairs MARCO-mediated
bacterial clearance and activates TNF secretion.

Ory et al. (1989) found nucleotide changes in the FCGR3B gene predicting
4 amino acid differences between the NA1 and NA2 alloantigens of
neutrophils involved in alloimmune neonatal neutropenia. As a result,
NA1 FCGR3 has only 4 potential N-linked glycosylation sites compared
with 6 in NA2 FCGR3. In addition, Ory et al. (1989) found a silent
nucleotide change at codon 38: CTC (leu38) in NA1; CTT (leu38) in NA2.

;;BETA-KETOACYL SYNTHASE, MITOCHONDRIAL; KS
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

OXSM is a mitochondrial beta-ketoacyl synthase (EC 2.3.1.41) involved in
mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis. It is required for catalysis of the
chain-elongating condensation reaction (Zhang et al., 2005).

CLONING

By searching human genomic and EST databases with prokaryotic
beta-ketoacyl synthase sequences as probes, followed by PCR, Zhang et
al. (2005) cloned OXSM. The deduced 459-amino acid protein has a
predicted molecular mass of 45.8 kD that was confirmed by SDS-PAGE. It
contains an N-terminal 38-amino acid sequence that functions as a
mitochondrial targeting signal as well as other conserved sequences
including a cysteine nucleophile, two catalytic histidine residues, and
a C-terminal glycine-rich motif. Northern blot analysis detected highest
expression in heart, skeletal muscle, liver, and kidney, with lower
levels in placenta, brain, spleen, and lung. Little or no expression was
detected in colon, thymus, and leukocytes.

GENE FUNCTION

Zhang et al. (2005) demonstrated that OXSM functionally complements the
yeast mutant cem1, which is characterized by a nuclear-encoded
respiratory-defective petite phenotype. Using purified histidine-tagged
OXSM, Zhang et al.(2005) showed that OXSM displays beta-ketoacyl
synthase activity, catalyzing elongation of mitochondrial acyl-ACP
(NDUFAB1; 603836) thioesters containing 2- to 14-carbon acyl moieties,
and showed highest affinities for the 4-carbon to 12-carbon acyl-ACP
thioesters. OXSM enzyme activity was inhibited by cerulenin, an
inhibitor of other fatty acid synthase systems.

MAPPING

By database sequence analysis, Zhang et al. (2005) mapped the OXSM gene
to chromosome 3p24.2 and the mouse homolog to chromosome 14.

613632	TITLE *613632 WAS PROTEIN FAMILY HOMOLOG 1; WASH1
;;WASH
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Linardopoulou et al. (2007) cloned WASH1, which they called WASH. The
deduced protein contains 468 amino acids. WASH has 2 WASH homology
domains (WHD1 and WHD2) in its N-terminal half. In its C-terminal half,
WASH has a proline-rich stretch followed by a WH2 actin (see
102560)-binding domain (V), a central region (C), and an acidic stretch
(A) that together form the VCA module found in all WASP proteins (see
WASF1; 605035). The VCA module mediates binding to actin and the ARP2/3
protein complex (604221) and stimulates actin nucleation. Northern blot
analysis detected an approximately 1.8-kb transcript in all tissues
examined. RNA dot blot analysis and RT-PCR confirmed ubiquitous and
variable WASH1 expression. Database analysis revealed WASH orthologs in
both vertebrates and invertebrates. Vertebrates showed highest
conservation in the WASH C terminus. Fluorescence-tagged WASH1
colocalized with cytoskeletal actin and accumulated in filopodia and
lamellipodia.

Using Western blot analysis of Jurkat human T cells, Gomez and Billadeau
(2009) detected WASH at an apparent molecular mass of 70 kD. HeLa cells
expressed a WASH isoform lacking the N-terminal region.
Immunohistochemical analysis revealed a punctate cytoplasmic WASH
distribution in Jurkat, HeLa, and U-87MG glioblastoma cell lines.

- Copy Number Variation

Linardopoulou et al. (2007) identified numerous subtelomeric copies of
the WASH gene distributed among multiple human chromosomes. FISH
analysis revealed variation in their copy number and location among
primate species and human individuals. Sequencing of long-range PCR
products from 3 unrelated individuals revealed up to 5 potentially
functional WASH variants and multiple pseudogenes per individual human
genome.

GENE FUNCTION

Linardopoulou et al. (2007) found that the isolated VCA module of
recombinant human WASH1 stimulated in vitro actin polymerization in the
presence of the ARP2/3 complex.

Gomez and Billadeau (2009) found that WASH was required for retrograde
transport of cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (IGF2R;
147280) via the retromer complex (see 601272). WASH functioned in a
multiprotein complex of over 600 kD that also contained FAM21 (see
FAM21C; 613631) and APR2/3. Mutation analysis revealed that the N
terminus of WASH interacted with FAM21, the WHD2 domain interacted with
alpha-tubulin (see 602529), and the VCA region interacted with actin.
WASH interaction with FAM21 was required for its endosomal localization.
Knockdown of WASH blocked retromer-mediated endosome sorting.

GENE STRUCTURE

Linardopoulou et al. (2007) determined that the WASH1 gene contains 11
exons and spans 15 kb. The first exon is noncoding and lies within a CpG
island.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Linardopoulou et al. (2007) mapped the
WASH1 gene to the subtelomeric region of chromosome 9p, where it ends
within 5 kb of the telomere array. Linardopoulou et al. (2007)
identified WASH pseudogenes on similar subtelomeric regions of
chromosomes 15q, 1p, Xq/Yq, and 16p. The single-copy mouse Wash ortholog
maps to an internal location on chromosome 17.

ANIMAL MODEL

Linardopoulou et al. (2007) found that knockout of the Drosophila WASH
ortholog, which they called washout, was early embryonic lethal.

cystatins, inhibitors of cysteine proteinases. Saitoh et al. (1991)
cloned the CST4 gene by screening a genomic library with the CST1 gene.
The CST4 gene encodes the 141-amino acid precursor form of cystatin S.
(The cystatin D gene was originally called CST4 but later renamed CST5.)

By RNase protection assay of 23 human tissues, Dickinson et al. (2002)
found that the level of CST4 was highest in submandibular gland,
intermediate in parotid gland, lacrimal gland, and gallbladder, lower in
kidney and seminal vesicles, and lowest in prostate.

GENE STRUCTURE

Saitoh et al. (1991) determined that the CST4 gene is composed of 3
exons spanning less than 4 kb.

MAPPING

Dickinson et al. (1994) mapped the CST4 gene to 20p11.2 by fluorescence
in situ hybridization. CST4 is clustered with other family II cystatins
in a region that spans less than 905 kb.

DESCRIPTION The multisubunit NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) is the first
enzyme complex in the electron transport chain of mitochondria. See
NDUFA2 (602137). To identify genes expressed in hematopoietic
stem/progenitor cells, Mao et al. (1998) sequenced cDNAs from umbilical
cord blood CD34-positive cell libraries. They identified a cDNA encoding
the human homolog of bovine CI-MNLL, a complex I subunit. The predicted
protein contains 58 amino acids.

603940	TITLE *603940 POTASSIUM CHANNEL, SUBFAMILY K, MEMBER 7; KCNK7
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Members of the tandem pore domain potassium (K2P) channel family, such
as TWIK1 (601745) and TREK (603219), contain 4 transmembrane domains and
2 pore-forming (P) domains. See KCNK6 (603939). By searching an EST
database for sequences related to mouse Kcnk6, Salinas et al. (1999)
isolated a human cDNA encoding a novel potassium channel, which they
designated KCNK7. RT-PCR revealed that exon skipping gives rise to 5
mRNA species encoding 3 protein forms, KCNK7-A, -B, and -C. The
predicted 307-amino acid KCNK7A form is the longest; KCNK7B and KCNK7C
have truncated cytoplasmic C termini. Sequence analysis revealed that
the KCNK7 protein contains 4 potential transmembrane segments and 2 P
domains. The P2 domain contains a very unconventional GLE motif instead
of the GLG found in TWIK1 and KCNK6 or the GFG found in other K2P
channels. The core region spanning the 4 transmembrane domains of KCNK7A
shares 80% and 42% protein sequence identity with those of Kcnk6 and
TWIK1, respectively. As with Kcnk6, none of the KCNK7 protein forms were
able to generate channel activity when expressed in mammalian cells.

MAPPING

By analysis of radiation hybrids, Salinas et al. (1999) mapped the KCNK7
gene to 11q13.

164762	TITLE *164762 V-CRK AVIAN SARCOMA VIRUS CT10 ONCOGENE HOMOLOG; CRK
;;ONCOGENE CRK;;
CRKII
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The CRK oncogene was originally identified as a transforming component
of the avian sarcoma virus CT10. A cDNA encoding the chicken cellular
homolog of v-crk was isolated by Reichman et al. (1992) and shown to
consist primarily of the SRC (190090) homology domains SH2 and SH3.
Matsuda et al. (1992) isolated 2 distinct human CRK cDNA species and
showed that the deduced amino acid sequences of the corresponding
polypeptides differed in their C termini. The 2 cDNA species were
considered to derive from the same genomic locus by alternative
splicing.

MAPPING

Fioretos et al. (1993) used fluorescence in situ hybridization to map
the CRK gene to chromosome 17p13. Deletion of this region of chromosome
17 is one of the most frequent chromosomal abnormalities in human
cancer. The TP53 gene (191170) maps to 17p13.1; Fioretos et al. (1993)
mapped the CRK oncogene to 17p13.3, which is a second region on 17p that
has been shown to manifest frequent loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in a
number of different tumor types. Thus, the region is presumed to harbor
a tumor suppressor gene.

GENE FUNCTION

Feller et al. (1994) described the SRC homology domains SH2 and SH3 as
molecular adhesives on many proteins involved in signal transduction.
They reviewed the interactions of ABL (189980) and CRK as a model of SH2
and SH3 interaction.

Hallock et al. (2010) found that Crk and Crkl (602007) were recruited to
mouse skeletal muscle synapses and played redundant roles in synaptic
differentiation. Crk and Crkl bound the same tyrosine-phosphorylated
sequences in Dok7 (610285), a protein that functions downstream of agrin
(AGRN; 103320) and muscle-specific receptor kinase (MUSK; 601296) in
synapse formation.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Cardoso et al. (2003) completed a physical and transcriptional map of
the 17p13.3 region from LIS1 to the telomere. Using Cardoso et al.
(2003), they mapped the deletion size in 19 children with ILS (607432),
11 children with Miller-Dieker syndrome (MDS; 164762), and 4 children
with 17p13.3 deletions not involving LIS1. They showed that the critical
region that differentiates ILS from MDS at the molecular level can be
reduced to 400 kb. Using somatic cell hybrids from selected patients,
the authors identified 8 genes that are consistently deleted in patients
classified as having MDS. These genes include ABR (600365),
14-3-3-epsilon (605066), CRK, MYO1C (606538), SKIP (603055), PITPNA
(600174), SCARF1, RILP, PRP8 (607300), and SERPINF1 (172860). In
addition, deletion of the genes CRK and 14-3-3-epsilon delineates
patients with the most severe lissencephaly grade. On the basis of
recent functional data and the creation of a mouse model suggesting a
role for 14-3-3-epsilon in cortical development, Cardoso et al. (2003)
suggested that deletion of 1 or both of these genes in combination with
deletion of LIS1 may contribute to the more severe form of lissencephaly
seen only in patients with MDS.

ANIMAL MODEL

Hallock et al. (2010) found that knockout of both Crk and Crkl in mouse
skeletal muscle, but not of either gene alone, caused perinatal
lethality. Lungs from Crk- and Crkl-deficient newborns failed to expand.
Embryonic day-18.5 muscle from Crk- and Crkl-deficient mice lacked
innervation and showed severe defects in presynaptic and postsynaptic
differentiation.

612678	TITLE *612678 CUGBP- AND ELAV-LIKE FAMILY, MEMBER 3; CELF3
;;TRINUCLEOTIDE REPEAT-CONTAINING GENE 4; TNRC4;;
BRUNO-LIKE 1; BRUNOL1;;
CUGBP- AND ETR3-LIKE FACTOR 3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the CELF family, such as CELF3, play various roles in
cotranscriptional and posttranscriptional RNA processing. All CELF
proteins appear to affect pre-mRNA splicing, but individual CELFs have
divergent roles in regulating mRNA stability and translation (summary by
Wagnon et al., 2012).

CLONING

By searching databases for human sequences similar to Xenopus Brunol1,
Good et al. (2000) identified a partial sequence for TNRC4, which they
called BRUNOL1. The partial human protein shares 91% amino acid identity
with Xenopus Brunol1.

By searching EST databases for sequences similar to CUGBP (601074),
followed by PCR of a human brain cDNA library, Ladd et al. (2001) cloned
TNRC4, which they called CELF3. The deduced 462-amino acid protein
contains 2 N-terminal RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), a C-terminal RRM,
several potential phosphorylation sites, and a nuclear localization
signal near the C terminus. Ladd et al. (2001) also identified a region
of allelic variation in CELF3 in which a variable number of CAG repeats
encode a stretch of glutamines of unfixed length. RNA dot blot analysis
detected CELF3 expression only in brain.

Using RNA dot blot analysis, Ladd et al. (2004) found that CELF3 was
highly expressed in several adult brain regions, in pituitary, and in
fetal brain.

By Western blot analysis of adult human cortex, Chapple et al. (2007)
showed that the full-length 465-amino acid TNRC4 protein had an apparent
molecular mass of about 50 kD. Epitope-tagged TNRC4 was expressed in the
nucleus and cytoplasm of transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells.
Removal of RRM3 led to exclusion of TNRC4 from the nucleus, confirming
the presence of a C-terminal nuclear localization signal.

GENE FUNCTION

Ladd et al. (2001) showed that all human CELF proteins, including CELF3,
bound RNA containing muscle-specific splicing enhancer (MSE) elements
and could activate MSE-dependent exon inclusion of cardiac troponin T
(TNNT2; 191045) minigenes in transfected quail fibroblasts.

By RT-PCR analysis of transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells, Chapple
et al. (2007) showed that TNRC4 activated inclusion of exon 10 in a tau
(MAPT; 157140) minigene. Deletion and mutation analyses showed that the
activity of TNRC4 on tau exon 10 splicing required RRM2 in TNRC4 and an
intronic element in tau pre-mRNA. The polyglutamine sequence of TNRC4
had no effect on tau exon 10 splicing. Tnrc4 -/- mice exhibited
decreased inclusion of exon 10 in tau mRNA.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Good et al. (2000) mapped the TNRC4 gene
to chromosome 1q21.

;;TRANSFERRIN RECEPTOR 1; TFR1;;
TFR;;
TRFR;;
CD71
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

A monoclonal antibody, OKT-9, recognizes an antigen ubiquitously
distributed on the cell surface of actively growing human cells. It is a
glycoprotein composed of disulfide-linked polypeptide chains, each of
90,000 daltons molecular weight. Immunoprecipitation of the OKT-9
antigen in the presence of labeled transferrin results in specific
precipitation of transferrin (Sutherland et al., 1981); thus, the OKT-9
antigen is presumably transferrin receptor. Nikinmaa and Schroder (1987)
concluded that p90 and TFRC are the same protein: studies using
monoclonal antibodies indicated that exhaustive precipitation of
radioactively labeled lysates with one antibody removed all activity of
lysates with the other. Peptide maps of antigens recognized with both
antibodies showed great similarity and indicated that both antibodies
react with the same antigen, the human transferrin receptor, but with
different antigenic sites of the molecule.

GENE FUNCTION

Casey et al. (1988) analyzed the regulation by iron of the TFRC gene by
examining mouse cells transformed with chimeric constructs containing
the human transferrin receptor gene's promoter and either the structural
gene for bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase or the human TFRC
cDNA. They concluded that at least 2 genetic elements, one 5-prime and
one 3-prime to the gene, are involved in the regulation of the TFRC gene
by iron.

Radoshitzky et al. (2007) demonstrated a specific high-affinity
association between TFR1 and the entry glycoprotein of Machupo virus (a
New World arenavirus). Expression of human TFR1, but not human TFR2
(604720), in hamster cell lines markedly enhanced the infection of
viruses pseudotyped with the glycoprotein of Machupo, Guanarito, and
Junin viruses, but not with those of Lassa or lymphocytic
choriomeningitis viruses. An anti-TFR1 antibody efficiently inhibited
the replication of Machupo, Guanarito, Junin, and Sabia viruses, but not
that of Lassa virus. Iron depletion of culture medium enhanced, and iron
supplementation decreased, the efficiency of infection by Junin and
Machupo but not Lassa pseudoviruses. Radoshitzky et al. (2007) concluded
that TFR1 is a cellular receptor for New World hemorrhagic fever
arenaviruses.

Ishii et al. (2009) found that knockdown of Ppargc1b (608886) in primary
mouse osteoclasts impaired their differentiation and mitochondrial
biogenesis. Transferrin receptor expression was induced in osteoclasts
via iron regulatory protein-2 (IREB2; 147582), and Tfrc-mediated iron
uptake promoted osteoclast differentiation and bone-resorbing activity,
which was associated with the induction of mitochondrial respiration,
production of reactive oxygen species, and accelerated Ppargc1b
transcription. Iron chelation inhibited osteoclastic bone resorption and
protected female mice against bone loss following estrogen deficiency
resulting from ovariectomy. Ishii et al. (2009) concluded that
mitochondrial biogenesis, which is induced by PPARGC1B and supported by
TFRC-mediated iron uptake for utilization by mitochondrial respiratory
proteins, is fundamental to osteoclast activation and bone metabolism.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid studies, Goodfellow et al. (1982) assigned the
TFR locus to chromosome 3. Miller et al. (1983) confirmed the assignment
to chromosome 3, specifically 3q22-qter. By in situ hybridization, Rabin
et al. (1985) narrowed the assignment to 3q26.2-qter. Adriaansen et al.
(1990) confirmed the assignment to chromosome 3 by study of somatic cell
hybrids. Using linkage analysis, somatic cell hybrid and radiation
hybrid mapping panels, and fluorescence in situ hybridization, Kashuba
et al. (1997) refined the localization of the TFRC gene to 3q29.

Valenzuela et al. (1991) found highly significant association between Rh
(111700) phenotypes and total iron binding capacity, i.e., transferrin.
Children with the C Rh specificity had higher values than non-C or c
individuals. Valenzuela et al. (1991) suggested that this finding may be
significant in relation to maintenance of the Rh polymorphism and
fetomaternal incompatibility.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Athletes such as racing cyclists sometimes use erythropoietin, which has
been officially included in the International Olympic Committee list of
banned substances since 1990, as a booster drug. Gareau et al. (1994)
presented evidence that the level of transferrin receptor in the blood
can be used as a means of detecting Epo misuse.

ANIMAL MODEL

Levy et al. (1999) disrupted the transferrin receptor gene, which they
termed Trfr, in mice. Homozygous mutant mice were not viable beyond
embryonic day 12.5 and had severe anemia with hydrops as well as diffuse
neurologic abnormalities. There was some variation of onset of severe
anemia, and in nonanemic embryos without tissue edema and necrosis
(E9.5), both stressed erythropoiesis and neurologic abnormalities were
apparent. The authors concluded that inadequate iron led to neuronal
apoptosis, but that tissues other than erythrocytes and neurons can
obtain sufficient iron for growth and development through mechanisms
independent of the transferrin cycle. Haploinsufficiency for the
transferrin receptor resulted in microcytic, hypochromic erythrocytes;
normal hemoglobin and hematocrit values were due to compensatory
increase in red cell numbers. Although iron saturation of serum
transferrin was indistinguishable from that of wildtype, heterozygotes
had significantly less tissue iron.

SPLICING FACTOR, ARGININE/SERINE-RICH, 3; SFRS3;;
SPLICING FACTOR, ARGININE/SERINE-RICH, 20-KD; SRp20
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The SR family of mRNA splicing factors was so designated because SR
proteins contain sequences of consecutive serine (S) and arginine (R)
dipeptides. Zahler et al. (1992) identified 6 SR proteins in HeLa cell
extracts, and named them SRp30a (600812), SRp30b (600813), SRp40
(600914), SRp20, SRp55 (601944), and SRp75 (601940), based on their
apparent molecular masses. By searching a sequence database with the
partial protein sequence of SRp20, the authors found that a previously
identified cDNA, X16, encoded mouse SRp20. Using PCR with primers based
on the X16 sequence, they cloned a HeLa cell cDNA encoding human SRp20.
The predicted 164-amino acid mouse and human proteins are identical. The
sequence of the SRp20 protein is related to those of the other SR
proteins identified; all contain 1 or 2 copies of an N-terminal repeat
(A and B) spaced by a series of glycine residues that may form a
flexible hinge, followed by a C-terminal SR domain. The A repeat
contains an RNA recognition motif (RRM). SRp20 and SRp30b contain repeat
A only. Zahler et al. (1992) reported that all animal cells tested
expressed at least 6 SR proteins. They suggested that SR proteins have
different specificities for subclasses of pre-mRNAs and that regulation
of the levels of SR proteins in different cell types contributes to the
regulation of cell-specific splice choices.

GENE FUNCTION

Lou et al. (1998) demonstrated that SRp20 affected the recognition of an
alternative 3-prime-terminal exon via an effect on the efficiency of
binding of the 64-kD subunit of CSTF (300907), a polyadenylation factor,
to an alternative polyadenylation site. They suggested that SR proteins
can influence pre-mRNA processing at the level of polyadenylation and
generally participate in terminal exon recognition.

Jumaa et al. (1997) demonstrated that in vivo, SRp20 mRNA levels are
cell cycle regulated and that the SRp20 mRNA is itself alternatively
spliced, apparently in a cell cycle-specific manner. Sequence analysis
revealed that the SRp20 promoter contains 2 consensus binding sites for
E2F (189971), a transcription factor thought to be involved in
regulating the cell cycle. The authors suggested that cellular pre-mRNA
splicing may be regulated during the cell cycle, perhaps in part by
regulated expression of SR proteins.

Lareau et al. (2007) reported that in every member of the human SR
family of splicing regulators, highly or ultraconserved elements are
alternatively spliced, either as alternative 'poison cassette exons'
containing early in-frame stop codons, or as alternative introns in the
3-prime untranslated region. These alternative splicing events target
the resulting mRNAs for degradation by means of an RNA surveillance
pathway called nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Mouse orthologs of the
human SR proteins exhibit the same unproductive splicing patterns. Three
SR proteins, SRp20, SC35 (600813), and 9G8 (SFRS7; 600572), had been
previously shown to direct splicing of their own transcripts, and SC35
autoregulates its expression by coupling alternative splicing with
decay. Lareau et al. (2007) concluded that unproductive splicing is
important for regulation of the entire SR family and found that
unproductive splicing associated with conserved regions has arisen
independently in different SR genes, suggesting that splicing factors
may readily acquire this form of regulation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Jumaa et al. (1997) found that the mouse SRp20 gene contains 6 exons and
an additional alternative exon.

MAPPING

By interspecific backcross analysis, Jumaa et al. (1997) mapped the
mouse SRp20 gene to a 2-centimorgan interval on chromosome 17.

;;RAS-ASSOCIATING GUANINE NUCLEOTIDE EXCHANGE FACTOR 2; RAGEF2;;
PDZ DOMAIN-CONTAINING GUANINE NUCLEOTIDE EXCHANGE FACTOR 2; PDZGEF2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching for sequences similar to RAGEF1 (RAPGEF2; 609530), followed
by screening a fetal brain cDNA library and 5-prime and 3-prime RACE,
Gao et al. (2001) cloned RAPGEF6, which they called RAGEF2. The deduced
1,509-amino acid protein contains several of the domains present in
RAPGEF2, including cNMP-binding, REM, PDZ, and RA domains as well as the
GEF catalytic domain. Northern blot analysis detected a RAPGEF6
transcript of about 8 kb which was abundantly expressed in heart, brain,
placenta, lung, and liver, but barely detectable in skeletal muscle,
kidney, and pancreas.

Kuiperij et al. (2003) cloned 2 splice variants of RAPGEF6, which they
called PDZGEF2A and PDZGEF2B, from human umbilical cord and Jurkat
T-cell cDNA libraries. The deduced proteins contain 1,601 and 1,391
amino acids, respectively, and they differ after amino acid 1,249. Like
RAPGEF2, PDZGEF2A contains a C-terminal proline-rich and a PDZ-binding
motif, whereas PDZGEF2B lacks these motifs. Unlike RAPGEF2, both PDZGEF2
isoforms contain a second, less conserved, N-terminal RCBD (related
cyclic nucleotide-binding domain) domain. Northern blot analysis
detected ubiquitous expression of an approximately 9.0-kb RAPGEF6
transcript.

GENE FUNCTION

Gao et al. (2001) found that human RAPGEF6 expressed in insect cells
showed GEF activity toward RAP1A (179520) and RAP2A (179540), but not
toward other RAS family members. RAPGEF6 colocalized with activated MRAS
(608435) in the plasma membrane of cotransfected COS-7 cells, leading to
an increase in the GTP-bound form of plasma membrane RAP1. Gao et al.
(2001) concluded that RAPGEF6 acts as the GEF for RAP1 and RAP2
downstream of MRAS in the plasma membrane. Kuiperij et al. (2003)
demonstrated that RAPGEF2 activated both RAP1 and RAP2.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Gao et al. (2001) and Kuiperij et al.
(2003) mapped the RAPGEF6 gene to chromosome 5.

602209	TITLE *602209 RAS-RESPONSIVE ELEMENT BINDING PROTEIN 1; RREB1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

In several neuroendocrine cell types, the RAS/RAF signal transduction
cascade results in cell differentiation (see HRAS; 190020). This signal
transduction cascade involves inactivation of several tiers of protein
kinases, including members of the RAF (e.g., RAF1; 164760), MAPKK, and
MAPK families (see 176872). Ultimately, activation of these protein
kinases results in the activation of transcription factors responsible
for changes in cell phenotype. In the human medullary thyroid carcinoma
cell line TT, an activated HRAS oncogene or activation of the RAF1 gene
induces a program of neuroendocrine differentiation (Carson et al.,
1995). One of the hallmarks of this differentiation process is an
increase in the expression of the calcitonin gene (114130). Thiagalingam
et al. (1996) reported the DNA affinity cloning of a RAS-responsive
element binding protein, RREB1, from the TT cell line. RREB1, a zinc
finger transcription factor, was shown to bind specifically to the
distal RAS-responsive element (RRE) in the calcitonin gene promoter and
to augment the RAS/RAF-mediated transcriptional response of that
promoter. Thus, they concluded that it may be involved in
RAS/RAF-mediated cell differentiation.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a promoter pull-down assay followed by mass spectrometry analysis,
Flajollet et al. (2009) identified RREB1 as a protein that bound the
HLA-G (142871) promoter. RREB1 exerted repressive activity on the
promoter in HLA-G-negative cells that was mediated by recruitment of
HDAC1 (601241) and CTBP1 (602618) and/or CTBP2 (602619). CTBP1 and CTBP2
are subunits of the C-terminal binding protein (CTBP) complex, a
corepressor involved in chromatin remodeling. The HLA-G promoter
contains 3 RREB1 target sites. Flajollet et al. (2009) proposed that the
repressive activity of RREB1 on the HLA-G promoter may be regulated by
posttranslational modifications governing its association with CTBP.

MAPPING

Thiagalingam et al. (1997) mapped the RREB1 gene to 6p25 by 3 mapping
methods: PCR analysis of a somatic cell hybrid panel, analysis of the
Stanford G3 radiation hybrid mapping panel, and fluorescence in situ
hybridization.

125255	TITLE *125255 DECORIN; DCN
;;PROTEOGLYCAN II;;
PG II;;
PG40
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Decorin and biglycan (301870) are related but distinct small
proteoglycans found in many connective tissues. Using Northern blot
analysis or RT-PCR, Danielson et al. (1993) detected the 2 alternatively
spliced leader exons of the DCN gene in a variety of mRNAs isolated from
human cell lines and tissues. Sequences highly homologous (74-87%) to
exons Ia and Ib were found in the 5-prime untranslated region of avian
and bovine decorin, respectively. This high degree of conservation among
species suggested regulatory functions for these leader exons. In situ
hybridization studies of developing mouse embryos suggested that decorin
may play a role in epithelial/mesenchymal interactions during organ
development and shaping (Scholzen et al., 1994).

GENE STRUCTURE

Danielson et al. (1993) found that the human decorin gene spans more
than 38 kb and contains 8 exons and very large introns, 2 of which are
5.4 and more than 13.2 kb. They discovered 2 alternatively spliced
leader exons, Ia and Ib, in the 5-prime untranslated region.

MAPPING

By Southern analysis of a panel of human-rodent somatic cell hybrid DNAs
with cDNA probes, McBride et al. (1990) assigned the DCN gene to
chromosome 12. Regionalization to 12p12.1-qter was obtained by examining
hybrids containing spontaneous breaks or well-characterized
translocations involving chromosome 12. Hybridization with subfragment
cDNA probes suggested the presence of 2 copies of the DCN gene, or
related sequences, at the locus on chromosome 12, although there was no
evidence for the function of more than one DCN gene. By in situ
hybridization, Pulkkinen et al. (1992) placed the DCN gene at 12q21-q22.
Vetter et al., (1993) mapped the human decorin gene by in situ
hybridization to 12q21.3. Using a genomic clone as the labeled probe and
in situ hybridization, Danielson et al. (1993) mapped the DCN gene to
12q23. They specifically noted that there were 4 times as many grains
centered on 12q23 as on 12q21, where Pulkkinen et al. (1992) had placed
the probable site. In a study of candidate genes for Noonan syndrome
(163950), Ion et al. (2000) reassigned the map position of DCN to
12q13.2 using FISH. Scholzen et al. (1994) assigned the homologous gene
in the mouse to chromosome 10, using interspecific backcrossing.

GENE FUNCTION

Vogel and Clark (1989) found little evidence that the metabolism of
either decorin or biglycan is altered by abnormalities in the structure
or secretion of types I and III collagen. In a presumably homozygous
case of the Marfan syndrome (154700) reported by Schollin et al. (1988),
Pulkkinen et al. (1990) found markedly decreased level of mRNA for
decorin, markedly decreased decorin polypeptide in the culture medium of
fibroblasts from the infant, and deficient effect of interleukin-1-beta
(147720) on the transcription of decorin as tested in these fibroblasts.
In 3 of 12 other unrelated Marfan patients, they also found deficient
decorin expression.

Dyne et al. (1996) studied 2 patients with osteogenesis imperfecta and
the same gly415-to-ser mutation of the COL1A1 gene (120150.0044), but a
different clinical expression. They speculated that these differences
could be the result of abnormalities in other connective tissue
proteins. Since decorin is a component of connective tissue, binds to
type I collagen fibrils, and plays a role in matrix assembly, they
studied decorin production in skin fibroblasts from these 2 patients.
Cultured fibroblasts from the patient with extremely severe osteogenesis
imperfecta (classified as type II/III) were found to secrete barely
detectable amounts of decorin into culture medium. Northern blot
analysis showed decorin mRNA levels below the limit of detection. The
patient with a less severe phenotype had fibroblasts that expressed
decorin normally. Dyne et al. (1996) suggested that the different
clinical phenotypes could be due to the differing genetic backgrounds of
the patients, such that in the more severely affected patient the
absence of decorin aggravated the clinical phenotype.

When expressed ectopically, decorin is capable of suppressing the growth
of various tumor cell lines. Moscatello et al. (1998) demonstrated that
it induced a marked growth suppression in A431 squamous carcinoma cells,
when either exogenously added or endogenously produced by a transgene.
Decorin caused rapid phosphorylation of the EGF receptor (131550) and a
concurrent activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase signal
pathway. Thus, EGF and decorin converge functionally to regulate the
cell cycle through activation of a common pathway that ultimately leads
to growth suppression.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a family with congenital stromal corneal dystrophy (CSCD; 610048),
Bredrup et al. (2005) identified a heterozygous 1-bp deletion in the
last exon, which they erroneously labeled exon 10 (Rodahl, 2009), of the
DCN gene (125255.0001). The deletion was found in all affected family
members but not in any healthy family member or in 200 normal controls.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001

DCN, 1-BP DEL, 967T

In a Norwegian family originally reported by Odland (1968) with
congenital stromal corneal dystrophy (CSCD; 610048), Bredrup et al.
(2005) identified a heterozygous 1-bp deletion (967delT) in the last
exon, which they erroneously labeled exon 10 (Rodahl, 2009), of the DCN
gene. The mutation was predicted to lead to a frameshift, alteration of
4 amino acids, and loss of the C-terminal 33 amino acids (S323fsX5).
Bredrup et al. (2005) postulated that the defective interaction of
mutant decorin with collagen would disturb the regularity of corneal
collagen in affected heterozygotes.

604633	TITLE *604633 EGF-CONTAINING FIBULIN-LIKE EXTRACELLULAR MATRIX PROTEIN 2; EFEMP2
;;FIBULIN 4; FBLN4
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

A large number of extracellular matrix proteins contain variations of
the epidermal growth factor (EGF; 131530) domain, e.g., fibrillin (FBN1;
134797) and Notch (190198). As part of their efforts in transcriptional
mapping of the human 11q13.1-q13.2 genomic region, Katsanis et al.
(2000) identified a novel partial cDNA from a human brain cDNA library.
They called the cDNA 'EGF-containing fibulin-like extracellular matrix
protein-2' (EFEMP2) because of its significant homology to EFEMP1
(601548). Sequence analysis detected 6 putative calcium-binding EGF
domains and 4 EGF modules. Katsanis et al. (2000) observed expression of
a 2.0-kb EFEMP2 transcript in all adult tissues tested by Northern blot
analysis, with highest levels in heart. RT-PCR detected a 105-bp
amplicon from the 3-prime untranslated region in fetal brain, kidney,
and heart, but not in lung. EFEMP1 is likewise expressed in a wide range
of adult and fetal tissues. In contrast to EFEMP1, however, EFEMP2 was
not significantly overexpressed in senescent or quiescent fibroblasts,
suggesting a diversity of function within this EGF-like domain
subfamily. Katsanis et al. (2000) also cloned the mouse Efemp2 homolog.

MAPPING

By analysis of a somatic cell hybrid panel and by placement on a series
of genomic clones by PCR, Katsanis et al. (2000) mapped the EFEMP2 gene
to chromosome 11q13, in an area where several retinopathies have shown
genetic linkage.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Doyne Honeycomb Retinal Dystrophy

Given that EFEMP1 is the site of mutations causing Doyne honeycomb
retinal dystrophy (126600), Katsanis et al. (2000) suggested EFEMP2 as a
candidate for retinal dystrophies. Toto et al. (2002) studied linkage of
both the EFEMP2 and EFEMP1 genes to malattia leventinese in a
3-generation Swiss-Italian family. Linkage was found only to EFEMP1 in 2
of 5 affected family members.

- Autosomal Recessive Cutis Laxa

Cutis laxa is a condition characterized by redundant, pendulous, and
inelastic skin. A severe autosomal recessive form of cutis laxa (ARCL1A;
219100) is caused by mutation in the fibulin-5 gene (FBLN5; 604580).
Hucthagowder et al. (2006) hypothesized that mutations in other members
of the fibulin gene family may cause cutis laxa as well. In a child of
Iraqi descent with cutis laxa and severe systemic connective tissue
abnormalities (ARCL1B; 614437), Hucthagowder et al. (2006) detected a
homozygous missense mutation in the FBLN4 gene (604633.0001). The role
of fibulin-4 in elastic fiber formation is evolutionarily conserved in
mammals (McLaughlin et al., 2006); however, additional observations in
the patient of Hucthagowder et al. (2006) suggested that fibulin-4 may
have additional pleiotropic functions in vascular patterning and
collagen biosynthesis.

In an infant girl who died at day 27 of life with apparent
arachnodactyly, cutis laxa, and severe systemic vascular abnormalities
similar to those of the patient described by Hucthagowder et al. (2006),
and who was negative for mutation in the FBLN5 gene, Dasouki et al.
(2007) identified compound heterozygosity for a missense mutation and a
4-bp duplication in the FBLN4 gene (604633.0002 and 604633.0003,
respectively). Dasouki et al. (2007) concluded that deficiency in
fibulin-4 leads to a perinatal lethal condition associated with elastic
tissue abnormalities.

Hoyer et al. (2009) reported the third case of cutis laxa due to
mutation in FBLN4, an infant girl who died immediately after birth with
extreme bradycardia and who was found to be homozygous for a missense
mutation (604633.0004). Hoyer et al. (2009) stated that this case
extended the phenotypic spectrum of FBLN4 mutations to include
microcephaly, overgrowth, and arachnodactyly.

Renard et al. (2010) sequenced the FBLN4 gene in 17 patients with
prominent cutis laxa but no major cardiovascular findings, and detected
no mutations. Analysis of FBLN4 in a second cohort of 22 patients who
had mild skin involvement but significant cardiovascular features,
including arterial tortuosity, stenosis, and aneurysms, revealed
homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for mutations in the FBLN4 gene
in 3 patients (604633.0005-604633.0008). Renard et al. (2010) concluded
that patients with recessive FBLN4 mutations are predominantly
characterized by aortic aneurysms and arterial tortuosity and stenosis.
Immunostaining of aortic and lung tissue showed an increase in TGF-beta
(190180), which was confirmed by phosphorylated SMAD2 (601366)
immunoblotting of fibroblast cultures; Renard et al. (2010) stated that
this was the first evidence of involvement of altered TGFB signaling in
the pathogenesis of FBLN4 mutations in humans.

Kappanayil et al. (2012) reported 22 unrelated infants from the Malabar
region of the southern Indian state of Kerala. All were Muslims and came
from the community known as the Mappilas. Twenty-one of 22 were
homozygous for a missense mutation in exon 7 of FBLN4 (604633.0009). One
patient was compound heterozygous for this mutation and a second, de
novo, mutation (604633.0010) on her paternal chromosome. Both mutations
occurred in the same calcium-binding EGF domain of the protein. Neither
mutation was found among 200 control alleles.

EFEMP2, GLU57LYS

In a child of nonconsanguineous parents of Iraqi descent with cutis laxa
(ARCL1B; 614437), Hucthagowder et al. (2006) found homozygosity for a
169G-A transition in the FBLN4 gene that resulted in a glu57-to-lys
(E57K) amino acid substitution. Each of her parents was heterozygous for
this mutation. Multiple alignments showed that the E57 residue was
completely conserved in calcium-binding epidermal growth factor (EGF)
modules, consistent with this residue being essential for calcium
binding. Hucthagowder et al. (2006) pointed out that the same
substitution at a homologous residue in fibulin-1, E1073K (134797.0038),
causes severe, neonatal Marfan syndrome.

CUTIS LAXA, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE, TYPE IB
EFEMP2, ARG279CYS

In an infant girl with cutis laxa, apparent arachnodactyly, and severe
systemic vascular abnormalities (ARCL1B; 614437), who died at day 27 of
life, Dasouki et al. (2007) identified compound heterozygosity for an
835C-T transition in exon 8 of the EFEMP2 gene, resulting in an
arg279-to-cys (R279C) substitution at a highly conserved residue at the
end of the fifth cbEGF module, and a 4-bp duplication in exon 10
(1070dupCCGC; 604633.0003), predicted to truncate the protein and
replace the last 85 amino acids of the FC domain with an incorrect arg
residue. The missense mutation was not found in 50 controls. Analysis of
the patient's fibroblasts revealed that fibulin-4 protein was barely
detectable in culture medium and not seen in cell extract and matrix,
and immunostaining of patient fibroblasts showed a total absence of
fibulin-4 fibers from the extracellular matrix.

Renard et al. (2010) performed immunohistochemical staining of fibulin-4
on aortic tissue from the patient previously studied by Dasouki et al.
(2007) and confirmed the near absence of extracellular fibulin-4 in the
aortic wall compared to the control, whereas intracellular staining was
similar to that of the control, suggesting that the mutant protein is
either not secreted or is secreted into extracellular space to a lesser
extent. Immunohistochemical staining for phosphorylated SMAD2 (601366)
and CTGF (121009), an effector of TGF-beta (190180) signaling and a
TGF-beta-driven gene product, respectively, in patient aorta and lungs
showed a more intense and increased nuclear staining compared to control
tissues.

EFEMP2, CYS267TYR

In an infant girl with cutis laxa (ARCL1B; 614437), born of
consanguineous Iraqi parents, Hoyer et al. (2009) identified
homozygosity for an 800G-A transition in exon 7 of the FBLN4 gene,
resulting in a cys267-to-tyr (C267Y) substitution involving the fifth of
six highly conserved residues in the fifth cbEGF module. The unaffected
parents were heterozygous for the mutation.

Renard et al. (2010) performed immunoblotting experiments on the culture
medium of dermal fibroblasts from the patient previously studied by
Hoyer et al. (2009), and observed a complete absence of fibulin-4.
Immunoblotting after TGF-beta (190180) stimulation of patient fibroblast
cultures indicated a significantly increased phosphorylated SMAD2
(601366) signal compared to controls, suggesting that mutation in FBLN4
has an effect on the TGFB signaling pathway.

.0005
CUTIS LAXA, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE, TYPE IB
EFEMP2, GLU126LYS

In a 20-year-old woman with velvety skin and severe arterial tortuosity,
aneurysm, and stenosis (ARCL1B; 614437), originally reported by Ades et
al. (1996), Renard et al. (2010) identified homozygosity for a 376G-A
transition in exon 5 of the EFEMP2 gene, resulting in a glu126-to-lys
(E126K) substitution at an evolutionarily conserved residue in the DINE
consensus sequence of the second cbEGF-like domain. The mutation was not
found in 200 control chromosomes. Immunoblotting experiments on dermal
fibroblast culture medium showed only a slightly diminished amount of
fibulin-4 compared to control, which the authors suggested was
consistent with the longer survival of the patient. In addition,
immunoblotting after TGF-beta (190180) stimulation of patient fibroblast
cultures indicated a significantly increased phosphorylated SMAD2
(601366) signal compared to controls, suggesting that mutation in FBLN4
has an effect on the TGFB signaling pathway.

CUTIS LAXA, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE, TYPE IB
EFEMP2, GLU126VAL

In a female infant with arterial tortuosity and aneurysm (ARCL1B;
614437), who suffered a large hemispheric stroke at 5 weeks of age and
died at age 18 months from cardiorespiratory failure, Renard et al.
(2010) identified compound heterozygosity for a 377A-T transversion in
exon 5 of the EFEMP2 gene, resulting in a glu126-to-val (E126V)
substitution at an evolutionarily conserved residue in the DINE
consensus sequence of the second cbEGF-like domain, and a 1-bp deletion
(577delC) in exon 6, causing a frameshift predicted to result in a
premature termination codon (Q193Sfs*12). The unaffected parents were
each heterozygous for 1 of the mutations, neither of which was present
in 200 control chromosomes. Clinical features in this patient included a
prominent forehead, mild hypertelorism, downslanting palpebral fissures,
depressed nasal bridge, low-set and distorted external ears, and long
fingers. Echocardiogram showed severe dilation of the ascending aorta
and severe tortuosity of the entire aorta with hypoplasia of the
transverse aortic arch, proximal descending, thoracic, and abdominal
aorta. MRI showed severe tortuosity of the carotid and cerebral
arteries.

In a 7-year-old boy with arterial tortuosity, aneurysm, and joint laxity
(ARCL1B; 614437), originally reported by Baspinar et al. (2005), Renard
et al. (2010) identified homozygosity for a 1189G-A transition in exon
11 of the EFEMP2 gene, resulting in an ala397-to-thr (A397T)
substitution at a highly conserved residue in the C-terminal
fibulin-like module. His unaffected parents were heterozygous for the
mutation.

.0009
CUTIS LAXA, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE, TYPE 1B
EFEMP2, ASP203ALA

In 21 patients, 11 male and 10 female, with ARCL1B (614437), Kappanayil
et al. (2012) identified homozygosity for an A-to-C transversion at
nucleotide 608 in exon 7 of the EFEMP2 gene that resulted in an aspartic
acid-to-alanine substitution at codon 203 (D203A). All patients were
Muslims from the Mappila community of the Malabar region of the Indian
state of Kerala; 8 came from consanguineous families. All parents tested
were normal and carried this mutation in heterozygosity. Homozygosity
was lethal in 17 of the 21 patients, who died at a median age of 4
months. In another patient from the same community, Kappanayil et al.
(2012) detected compound heterozygosity for this mutation and a de novo
missense mutation (604633.0010).

.0010
CUTIS LAXA, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE, TYPE 1B
EFEMP2, ARG227CYS

In 1 patient with ARCL1B (614437) from the Indian Mappila community,
Kappanayil et al. (2012) detected compound heterozygosity for an
asp203-to-ala mutation (D203A; 604633.0009) and a de novo C-to-T
transition at nucleotide 679 resulting in an arginine-to-cysteine
substitution at codon 227 (R227C). The mutation was found on the
paternal allele; paternity was proven. Both the D203A and R227C
mutations occurred in the same calcium-binding EGF domain of FBLN4.
While this patient had vascular abnormalities similar to those seen in
D203A homozygotes, the majority of whom died before the age of 4 months,
she remained asymptomatic at the age of 7 years.

605952	TITLE *605952 SORTING NEXIN 9; SNX9
;;SH3 DOMAIN- AND PX DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN; SH3PX1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the sorting nexin protein family, such as SNX9, contain a
phospholipid-binding module called the phox homology (PX) domain. SNX9
functions in clathrin (see 118955)-mediated endocytosis and
clathrin-independent, actin (see 102610)-dependent fluid-phase
endocytosis (Yarar et al., 2007).

CLONING

By use of a yeast 2-hybrid screen, Howard et al. (1999) identified 2 SH3
domain-containing proteins, endophilin-1 (SH3GL2; 604465) and SNX9, that
interact with the cytoplasmic domains of metalloprotease disintegrins
ADAM9 (602713) and ADAM15 (605548). The 595-amino acid SNX9 protein
contains an N-terminal SH3 domain, followed by a PX domain and a
C-terminal coiled-coil domain. Northern blot analysis detected wide
expression of 4.4- and 3.1-kb transcripts, with high levels in heart and
placenta and relatively low levels in thymus and peripheral blood
leukocytes.

GENE FUNCTION

Howard et al. (1999) determined that binding of the SH3 domain of SNX9
to ADAM9 and ADAM15 required the C-terminal proline-rich region of the
ADAM9 and ADAM15 cytoplasmic tails. Both SNX9 and SH3GL2 preferentially
bound the precursors, but not the processed forms, of ADAM9 and ADAM15.

Using green monkey kidney cells, Yarar et al. (2007) showed that SNX9
was required for clathrin-independent, actin-dependent fluid-phase
endocytosis. SNX9 directly regulated F-actin nucleation through N-WASP
(WASL; 605056) and the ARP2 (ACTR2; 604221)/ARP3 (ACTR3; 604222)
complex, and this activity was synergistically enhanced by
phosphatidylinositol(4,5)bisphosphate-containing liposomes. Yarar et al.
(2007) concluded that SNX9 physically couples F-actin nucleation to
plasma membrane remodeling during endocytosis.

Posor et al. (2013) showed that the BAR domain protein SNX9 is a
phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate (PI(3,4)P2) effector at
clathrin-coated pits in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Timed formation
of PI(3,4)P2 by class 2 phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase C2A (PI3KC2A;
603601) is required for selective enrichment of SNX9 at late-stage
endocytic intermediates.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the SNX9
gene to chromosome 6 (TMAP WI-19319).

205100	TITLE #205100 AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS 2, JUVENILE; ALS2
;;ALS, JUVENILE; ALSJ
DESCRIPTION A number sign (#) is used with this entry because juvenile amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis-2 (ALS2) can be caused by homozygous mutation in the
gene encoding alsin (ALS2; 606352) on chromosome 2q33.

Juvenile primary lateral sclerosis (PLSJ; 606353) and infantile-onset
ascending spastic paralysis (IAHSP; 607225) are allelic disorders with
overlapping phenotypes.

For a phenotypic description and a discussion of genetic heterogeneity
of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), see ALS1 (105400).

CLINICAL FEATURES

In an Amish isolate, Gragg et al. (1971) observed 2 brothers with onset
in the first decade of the ALS symptom complex: distal muscular atrophy,
increased deep tendon reflexes, spasticity, and fasciculations. Refsum
and Skillicon (1954) described the same phenotype in 2 brothers and a
sister, with onset between 3 and 5 years of age. They stated that the
condition was indistinguishable from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS;
105400).

Hentati et al. (1992, 1994) reported a Tunisian family in which 10
members had juvenile-onset ALS with symptoms beginning between ages 3
and 23 years. The disorder was characterized by progressive spasticity
of the limb, facial, and pharyngeal muscles with spastic gait and
spastic dysarthria. Some patients had amyotrophy of the hands and
peroneal muscles. Several patients had uncontrolled laughter and
weeping, consistent with pseudobulbar symptoms. This family had also
been reported in a larger series of affected families by Ben Hamida et
al. (1990).

Kress et al. (2005) reported a Turkish man, born of consanguineous
parents, with juvenile ALS confirmed by mutation in the ALS2 gene
(606352.0011). He had a severe disease course with onset at age 2 years
of difficulty walking, spastic gait, hyperreflexia, and extensor plantar
responses. Spastic tetraparesis and pseudobulbar paralysis developed at
ages 12 and 15 years, respectively. He became wheelchair-bound at age 16
and anarthric at 18. He also had mild distal amyotrophy of the upper and
lower limbs.

Shirakawa et al. (2009) reported 2 Japanese brothers, born of unrelated
parents, with juvenile ALS. The older brother, who was more severely
affected, started walking on tiptoes at age 13 months and had never run.
He developed dysarthria at age 11 years and lost the ability to speak at
14. At age 32, he had lower limb spasticity, extensor plantar responses,
and complete paralysis of the tongue. He had mild signs of lower motor
neuron involvement, with distal muscle atrophy of the limbs, and normal
cognition. The younger brother had a milder disease course, with walking
at age 3 years, but ability to participate in gym during elementary
school. At age 23, he had unintelligible speech, mild muscle atrophy in
the extremities, and normal cognition.

MAPPING

By linkage analysis of a large consanguineous Tunisian family with
juvenile ALS, Hentati et al. (1992) established linkage to chromosome
2q33-q35 (maximum lod score of 7.67 at marker D2S72). Haplotype analysis
indicated a 20- to 25-cM interval between CRYG (123660) and COL3A1
(120180). By further linkage analysis in this family, Hentati et al.
(1994) refined the ALS2 locus to an 8-cM region between D2S115 and
D2S155. By linkage and haplotype analyses, Hosler et al. (1998) refined
the ALS2 locus to a 1.7-cM region. Hadano et al. (1999) assigned the
ALS2 gene to 2q33-q34 by inclusion within a YAC contig.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of the Tunisian family reported by Ben Hamida et al.
(1990) and Hentati et al. (1992, 1994), Yang et al. (2001) and Hadano et
al. (2001) identified a homozygous mutation in the ALS2 gene
(606352.0001).

610398	TITLE *610398 SAP30-LIKE PROTEIN; SAP30L
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using differential display analysis to search for genes upregulated by
TGFB1 (190180) in differentiating intestinal epithelial cells, followed
by screening a human heart cDNA library, Lindfors et al. (2003) cloned
SAP30L. The deduced 183-amino acid protein contains 2 potential
N-glycosylation sites, 1 N-myristoylation site, and several
phosphorylation sites. Transient transfection studies showed that SAP30L
localized to the nucleus in small dense bodies that are not PML bodies.
Mutation of the SAP30L nuclear localization signal caused the protein to
also be expressed throughout the cytoplasm. SAP30L shares 70% identity
with SAP30 (603378) and 97% identity with mouse Sap30l. Northern blot
detected a 1.30-kb transcript in all human tissues examined, with
highest expression in testis, followed by heart, kidney, and placenta. A
6.5-kb transcript had high expression in brain and lung.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lindfors et al. (2003) determined that the SAP30L gene contains 4 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Lindfors et al. (2003) mapped the SAP30L
gene to chromosome 5q33.2.

605181	TITLE *605181 TRANSMEMBRANE 7 SUPERFAMILY, MEMBER 3; TM7SF3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The superfamily of 7-transmembrane domain proteins, one of the largest
superfamilies of cell surface proteins, includes receptors for a variety
of ligands, such as peptides, hormones, and ions, and for external
sensory stimuli, such as odorants and light. Many 7-transmembrane
molecules are able to recruit small G proteins, suggesting that they can
transduce external signals to the cytoplasm. By sequencing cDNAs
randomly selected from a cDNA library derived from a human colon cancer
cell line, Akashi et al. (2000) identified TM7SF3. The predicted
570-amino acid protein contains 7 putative transmembrane domains, and 5
potential N-glycosylation sites in the N-terminal extracellular region.
Immunocytochemical analysis localized the TM7SF3 protein to the plasma
membrane. Northern blot analysis detected an approximately 2.5-kb TM7SF3
transcript in all human tissues examined, with highest expression in
kidney.

MAPPING

By FISH, Akashi et al. (2000) mapped the TM7SF3 gene to 12q11-q12. Using
radiation hybrid mapping, they localized the TM7SF3 gene between the
markers D12S1596 and D12S333.

605006	TITLE *605006 FREQUENTLY REARRANGED IN ADVANCED T-CELL LYMPHOMAS 2; FRAT2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Dorsal accumulation of beta-catenin (CTNNB1; 116806) in early Xenopus
embryos is required for body axis formation. Beta-catenin is dorsally
stabilized by the localized inhibition of the kinase GSK3 (see GSK3B;
605004). Using a yeast 2-hybrid system to identify a cytoplasmic
regulator of Xenopus GSK3, Yost et al. (1998) isolated an oocyte cDNA
encoding a 169-amino acid protein that they termed GSK3-binding protein,
or GBP. By searching sequence databases, Yost et al. (1998) identified 2
homologous human sequences, FRAT1 (602503) and FRAT2, a partial sequence
that shares 59% amino acid identity with FRAT1. Sequence analysis
predicted that GBP and the FRAT proteins contain 3 well-conserved
regions.

By screening a fetal lung cDNA library with an FT2S probe obtained from
a gastric cancer cell line that corresponds to an FRAT2 EST, Saitoh et
al. (2001) isolated a full-length cDNA encoding FRAT2. The deduced
233-amino acid protein, which is 77% identical to FRAT1, contains an
N-terminal acidic domain followed by a proline-rich domain and a
GSK3B-binding domain near the C terminus, which is highly divergent from
that of FRAT1. Northern blot analysis detected a 2.4-kb transcript, with
highest expression in pancreas, heart, spleen, placenta, skeletal
muscle, liver, peripheral blood leukocytes, and fetal kidney. Expression
was higher in gastric cancer, cervical cancer, and chronic myelogenous
leukemia cell lines than in other cancer cell lines.

GENE FUNCTION

Binding and functional analyses by Yost et al. (1998) revealed that the
GSK3-binding and -inhibitory activities of GBP and FRAT2 reside in the
C-terminal conserved domain III sequence. The authors proposed that GBP,
FRAT1, and FRAT2 form a family of GSK3-binding proteins that inhibit the
phosphorylation of beta-catenin, preventing its degradation by the
ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.

By functional analysis in the Xenopus axis duplication assay, Saitoh et
al. (2001) showed that FRAT2 is a positive regulator of the WNT (see
164975) signaling pathway. Saitoh et al. (2001) suggested that
upregulation of FRAT2 in human cancer may be implicated in
carcinogenesis through activation of the WNT signaling pathway.

MAPPING

By in silico analysis, Saitoh et al. (2001) mapped the FRAT2 gene to
10q24.1.

ANIMAL MODEL

Inhibition of GSK3 by FRAT was thought to be important for Wnt signal
transduction through beta-catenin. To test this hypothesis, van
Amerongen et al. (2005) developed triple-knockout mice lacking Frat1,
Frat2, and Frat3. They found that Frat-null mice were viable, healthy,
and fertile. In addition, in vitro assays of primary Frat-deficient
cells showed that Wnt signaling through beta-catenin was unaffected. Van
Amerongen et al. (2005) concluded that Wnt signaling in higher
vertebrates is not dependent on Frat.

613939	TITLE *613939 SPERMATOGENESIS-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 20; SPATA20
;;SPERM-SPECIFIC PROTEIN 411; SSP411
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Shi et al. (2004) cloned rat Spata20, which they called Ssp411, and they
identified human SSP411 by database analysis. The deduced 787-amino acid
human protein shares 87% identity with rat Ssp411. SSP411 contains an
N-terminal CxxC thioredoxin (TXN; 187700)-like motif (CHWC) that is
conserved in human, mouse, and rat. Rat Ssp411 also has putative sites
for N- and O-glycosylation and phosphorylation. The N-terminal region of
rat Ssp411 was predicted to assume a thioredoxin fold with a potential
active-site disulfide bond between the cysteines of the CHWC motif.
Northern blot and semiquantitative RT-PCR analyses of rat tissues
detected Ssp411 in testis only, where it was expressed in spermatids,
but not in spermatocytes or spermatogonia. In situ hybridization of
adult rat testis detected Ssp411 in round spermatids and early elongated
spermatids. Immunohistochemical analysis detected Ssp411 protein
predominantly in elongated spermatids.

GENE STRUCTURE

Shi et al. (2004) determined that the SPATA20 gene contains 16 exons and
spans 8.6 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Shi et al. (2004) mapped the SPATA20 gene
to chromosome 17. They mapped the mouse Spata20 gene to chromosome 11.

Hartz (2011) mapped the SPATA20 gene to chromosome 17q21.33 based on an
alignment of the SPATA20 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK025000) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

609451	TITLE *609451 ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 90, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF; ZFP90
;;NK10;;
KIAA1954
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Lange et al. (1995) cloned mouse Zfp90, which they designated Nk10. The
predominant cDNA encodes a protein with a calculated molecular mass of
72.4 kD. The N-terminal half of Zfp90 contains KRAB A and B domains, and
the C-terminal half contains 13 C2H2-type zinc finger motifs. Lange et
al. (1995) also identified alternatively spliced Zfp90 cDNAs with
5-prime extensions of exons 4 and 5. Northern blot analysis detected a
2.4-kb transcript expressed at highest levels in brain, heart, spleen,
and thymus. RT-PCR of mouse embryos detected Zfp90 expression
predominantly in brain. At about postnatal week 2, it was expressed in
most other tissues tested. At postnatal days 18 to 20, it was detected
in testicular tissue, simultaneous with the appearance of haploid cells.

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2001) obtained a partial ZFP90 clone, which they
designated KIAA1954. The transcript contains 2 SINEs in its 3-prime UTR.
The deduced protein shares 50% identity with ZNF471 and 85% identity
with Halobacterium transcription initiation factor IIB5. RT-PCR ELISA
detected intermediate to high expression in all adult and fetal tissues
and specific brain regions examined. Within whole tissues, highest ZPF90
expression was in spleen. Within specific brain regions, highest
expression was in caudate nucleus and substantia nigra.

GENE FUNCTION

Lange et al. (1995) demonstrated that mouse Zfp90 could bind DNA.
Binding was zinc dependent and required zinc fingers 2 through 8. The
KRAB domains of Zfp90 repressed reporter gene expression. The KRAB A
domain alone reduced reporter gene expression by 75 to 80%, and the KRAB
B domain reduced expression by 10 to 20%. Both domains together
repressed reporter gene expression nearly completely.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lange et al. (1995) determined that the mouse Zfp90 gene contains 5
exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Nagase et al. (2001) mapped the ZFP90 gene
to chromosome 16. Using backcross analysis, Lange et al. (1995) mapped
the mouse Zfp90 gene to a region of chromosome 8D3 that shares homology
of synteny with human chromosome 16q22.1.

;;HPAII TINY FRAGMENTS LOCUS 9C; HTF9C
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Guarguaglini et al. (1997) cloned mouse Htf9c, which encodes a deduced
676-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 75 kD. Htf9c
has a putative N-terminal nuclear targeting signal and a C-terminal
domain similar to yeast and bacterial nucleic acid-modifying enzymes.

GENE FUNCTION

Guarguaglini et al. (1997) found that mouse Htf9c and Ranbp1 (601180)
were divergently transcribed from a bidirectional promoter. Expression
of both genes was activated upon entry into the cell cycle, peaked in S
phase, and was downregulated during completion of the cell cycle. The
bidirectional promoter was downregulated in both orientations in
arrested cells. Activation of the promoter was specific, resulting in
more restricted Htf9c expression and a sharper peak of Htf9c expression
in S phase compared with Ranbp1 expression. A region containing an E2f
(189971) site was important for cell cycle control of Htf9c, and a
common region containing sites for Sp1 (189906) and E2f contributed to
activation in both orientations.

MAPPING

Hartz (2007) mapped the HTF9C gene to chromosome 22q11.21 based on an
alignment of the TRMT2A sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK025106) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.1).

611425	TITLE *611425 CENTROSOMAL BRCA2-INTERACTING PROTEIN; CNTROB
;;CENTROBIN;;
LYST-INTERACTING PROTEIN LIP8; LIP8
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CNTROB is a centrosomal protein that interacts with BRCA2 (600185) and
is required for centriole duplication and cytokinesis (Zou et al.,
2005).

CLONING

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis with the C-terminal 1,026 residues of
BRCA2 as bait followed by 5-prime RACE of human mammary gland cDNA, Zou
et al. (2005) cloned CNTROB, which they called centrobin. The authors
identified transcripts encoding a deduced 903-amino acid predominant
isoform called centrobin-alpha and a deduced 925-amino acid minor
isoform, centrobin-beta. CNTROB contains a predicted central coiled-coil
region with N- and C-terminal noncoiled regions, a structure common to
centrosomal proteins pericentrin (PCNT1; 170285) and ninein (NIN;
608684). Northern blot analysis detected a 3.8-kb transcript in most
human tissues with highest expression in testis, and in all cell lines
tested. Immunofluorescence studies using the normal mammary epithelial
cell line 76N and several cancer cell lines localized CNTROB to 1 or 2
perinuclear dots in interphase cells and to a single focus at the end of
each mitotic spindle in mitotic cells, in a pattern colocalizing with
that of centrosomal protein gamma-tubulin (TUBG1; 191135). Using
biochemical purification of centrosomes by sucrose-gradient
centrifugation and immunoblot analysis, Zou et al. (2005) localized
CNTROB to the centrosome fraction. Mitotic shake-off to synchronize 76N
TERT cells (a TERT (187270) immortalized 76N line) followed by
immunofluorescence and immunogold microscopy showed that CNTROB
localized to newly assembled daughter centrioles during centriole
assembly at late G1 or early S phase, and remained in the daughter
centrioles throughout the next cell cycle.

GENE FUNCTION

Following small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeted knockdown of CNTROB in
HeLa cells, Zou et al. (2005) observed a reduction in the proportion of
interphase and mitotic cells containing 4 centrioles. The effect was
most pronounced in mitotic cells; while nearly all control cells
contained 4 centrioles, 51% of CNTROB-depleted cells contained 4
centrioles, 45% contained 2 centrioles, and 4% contained 1 centriole.
Further experiments with synchronized cells and anti-centrin 2 (CETN2;
300006) and anti-alpha tubulin (TUBA1; 191110) staining confirmed that
CNTROB depletion inhibited centriole duplication. Using time-lapse
photography of CNTROB-depleted cells, Zou et al. (2005) showed that
siRNA knockdown of CNTROB significantly reduced the number of cells
completing cytokinesis. Zou et al. (2005) concluded that depletion of
CNTROB impairs centriole duplication and cytokinesis.
