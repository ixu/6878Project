DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using mouse Nemo/Ikk-gamma (IKBKG; 300248) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid
screen, Leonardi et al. (2000) cloned CIKS from a human liver cDNA
library. The deduced 574-amino acid protein contains a C-terminal
leucine zipper. Northern blot analysis of multiple human tissues
indicated ubiquitous expression of a 2.5-kb transcript.

Li et al. (2000) cloned a cDNA encoding ACT1 from a cDNA library
constructed from embryonic kidney cells induced to display constitutive
activation of nuclear factor kappa-B (NFKB; see 164011). The deduced
574-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 60 kD and
contains a helix-loop-helix domain and a C-terminal coiled-coil domain.
The helix-loop-helix domain shares 35% identity with the
helix-loop-helix domain of upstream stimulatory factor-1 (USF1; 191523).
Northern blot analysis detected highest expression in thymus, kidney,
and placenta, moderate expression in heart, skeletal muscle, colon,
liver, lung, and small intestine, and low expression in brain, spleen,
and peripheral blood leukocytes.

By screening thymus, skeletal muscle, and fetal liver cDNA libraries,
Morelli et al. (2000) identified 3 isoforms of ACT1 that they designated
C6ORF4, C6ORF5, and C6ORF6. C6ORF4 encodes a deduced 575-amino acid
protein. C6ORF5 and C6ORF6 result from the skipping of exon 2 and are
differentiated by use of alternate polyadenylation signals, yielding
identical proteins of 566 amino acids. Northern blot analysis detected
5.0- and 2.5-kb transcripts in all tissues examined, with a weak 3.8-kb
transcript in heart, skeletal muscle, and pancreas.

GENE FUNCTION

Leonardi et al. (2000) verified the interaction between CIKS and
IKK-gamma by in vitro binding assays using recombinant proteins and by
coimmunoprecipitation of lysates of transfected HeLa cells or
untransfected Jurkat T-leukemic cells. IKK-alpha (CHUK; 600664) and
IKK-beta (IKBKB; 603258) also coimmunoprecipitated with CIKS. Using
truncation mutants, the authors localized the binding domain to the N
terminus of CIKS. HeLa cells transfected with increasing amounts of CIKS
showed dose-dependent activation of an Ig kappa-B luciferase reporter
plasmid, and the activation could be blocked by cotransfection with
IKK-gamma. Cotransfection of CIKS with kinase-deficient mutants of NIK
(MAP3K14; 604655), MEKK1 (MAP3K1: 600982), IKK-alpha, and IKK-beta
indicated that CIKS activates NFKB exclusively through an IKK-dependent
mechanism. Overexpressed CIKS also potently activated SAPK/JNK (MAPK8;
601158). Analysis of the binding activity of truncation mutants showed
that the C terminus of CIK is involved in SAPK/JNK activation, whereas
the N terminus is necessary and sufficient for kappa-B reporter
activation.

Using gel shift assays, Li et al. (2000) confirmed constitutive
activation of NFKB with transfection of ACT1 into human embryonic kidney
cells. They also found constitutive activation of JNK and IKK.
Disruption of the N-terminal helix-loop-helix domain of ACT1 completely
abolished the interaction between ACT1 and the IKK complex as well as
the activation of NFKB.

By mutation analysis, Pacifico et al. (2003) identified a sequence in
the 5-prime flanking region of human CIKS that was essential for basal
promoter activity in a canine kidney cell line. RT-PCR, Northern, and
Western blot analyses showed that various proinflammatory cytokines
upregulated CIKS expression in HeLa cells.

Using immunoprecipitation analysis, Qian et al. (2007) found that IL17
(603149) induced association of ACT1 with IL17RA (605461) in various
cell types. The ACT1-IL17RA interaction required the SEFIR domain of
IL17RA. Expression of Il17-dependent inflammation-related genes was
abolished in Act1-deficient mouse cells. Mice lacking Act1 had delayed
onset and lower severity of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, as
well as limited colitis. Qian et al. (2007) concluded that ACT1 is
essential for IL17-dependent signaling in autoimmune and inflammatory
disease.

GENE STRUCTURE

Morelli et al. (2000) determined that the ACT1 gene contains 10 exons
and spans more than 50 kb. They also identified C6UAS, which overlaps
exon 2 and is transcribed in the antisense orientation from the
complementary strand of C6ORF4. C6UAS has no apparent open reading
frame, but Morelli et al. (2000) provided experimental evidence that it
has a regulatory function and can behave as an antisense RNA in the
control of C6ORF4 translation.

Pacifico et al. (2003) mapped the CIKS transcription start site and
found that the 5-prime flanking region was TATA-less, but it had
initiator, GC, and CAAT boxes.

MAPPING

Morelli et al. (2000) identified ACT1 within an EST clone that maps to
chromosome 6q21.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Ellinghaus et al. (2010) and Huffmeier et al. (2010) independently
identified association of a coding single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP),
dbSNP rs33980500 (607043.0001), in the TRAF3IP2 gene with psoriasis
susceptibility (PSORS13; 614070).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
PSORIASIS SUSCEPTIBILITY 13
TRAF3IP2, ASP19ASN (dbSNP rs33980500)

In a case-control genomewide association study of psoriasis
susceptibility (PSORS13; 614070), Ellinghaus et al. (2010) identified a
coding SNP, dbSNP rs33980500, in exon 2 of the TRAF3IP2 gene. A C-to-T
transition results in substitution of asn for asp at codon 19 (D19N).
This SNP was significantly associated with risk for psoriasis vulgaris
(P = 1.24 x 10(-16)) and psoriatic arthritis (P = 4.57 x 10(-12)).

In an independent case-control genomewide association study, Huffmeier
et al. (2010) found significant association of dbSNP rs33980500 with
psoriatic arthritis in a subset of cases and controls (P = 1.13 x
10(-20), OR = 1.95). Functional assays showed reducing binding of this
TRAF3IP2 variant to TRAF6 (602355), suggesting altered modulation of
immunoregulatory signals through altered TRAF interactions as a novel
and shared pathway for psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis vulgaris.
Huffmeier et al. (2010) referred to the amino acid change correlated
with this SNP as ASP10ASN.

180490	TITLE *180490 RIBOPHORIN II; RPN2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The RPN2 gene encodes ribophorin II, which is involved in ribosome
binding. Ribophorin I (RPN1; 180470) and RPN2 are abundant, highly
conserved glycoproteins located exclusively in the membranes of the
rough endoplasmic reticulum (Crimaudo et al., 1987).

CLONING

Using probes derived from a human liver expression library, Crimaudo et
al. (1987) isolated and sequenced full-length human cDNA clones encoding
ribophorins I and II. The cDNA clones hybridized to mRNA species of 2.5
kb and encoded polypeptides of 68.5 and 69.3 kD, respectively. Sequence
comparisons and immunoblotting with specific antibodies showed both
proteins to be highly conserved throughout a variety of species.
However, no relationship between the 2 proteins could be deduced from
their primary sequences.

MAPPING

Using cDNAs in the study of a panel of somatic cell hybrids, Barton et
al. (1987) mapped RPN2 to chromosome 20. Loffler et al. (1991) mapped
the RPN2 gene to 20q12-q13.1 by in situ hybridization.

GENE FUNCTION

Kelleher et al. (1992) reported that mammalian oligosaccharyltransferase
activity is associated with a protein complex composed of ribophorin I,
ribophorin II, and a 48-kD oligosaccharyltransferase protein (602202).

Among 44 women with breast cancer (114480), Honma et al. (2008) observed
a significant association (p = 0.0052) between increased expression of
RPN2 in cancer tissue and decreased clinical response to the
antimicrotubule chemotherapeutic agent docetaxel. Small interfering RNA
(siRNA) targeting RPN2 significantly promoted docetaxel-dependent
apoptosis and cell growth inhibition of docetaxel-resistant human breast
cancer cells in vitro. In vivo atelocollagen delivery of RPN2 siRNA
significantly reduced drug-resistant tumor growth in mice given
docetaxel. Further studies indicated that RPN2 conferred drug resistance
via increased glycosylation of P-glycoproteins. Honma et al. (2008)
concluded that RPN2 siRNA introduction may hypersensitize cancer cell
responses to chemotherapeutic agents.

300560	TITLE *300560 PHD FINGER PROTEIN 8; PHF8
;;ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 422; ZNF422;;
KIAA1111
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Kikuno et al. (1999) cloned PHF8, which they designated
KIAA1111. The deduced 1,084-amino acid protein contains a PHD finger
motif. RT-PCR ELISA detected highest PHF8 expression in ovary.
Expression was intermediate in all other adult and fetal tissues and
specific brain regions examined.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Kikuno et al. (1999) mapped the PHF8 gene
to chromosome X.

GENE FUNCTION

Loenarz et al. (2010) reported that recombinant PHF8 is an Fe(II) and
2-oxoglutarate-dependent N-epsilon-methyl lysine demethylase, which acts
on histone substrates. PHF8 is selective in vitro for N-epsilon-di- and
monomethylated lysine residues and does not accept trimethyl substrates.
Clinically observed mutations to the PHF8 gene cluster in exons encoding
for the double-stranded beta-helix fold and are expected to disrupt
catalytic activity. The PHF8 F279S mutation (300560.0004), which is
associated with mild MR, mild dysmorphic features, and cleft lip and
palate, modifies a conserved hydrophobic region, rendering the enzyme
catalytically inactive. Loenarz et al. (2010) hypothesized that
dependence of PHF8 activity on oxygen availability may explain an
association between maternal hypoxia and facial clefting.

Qi et al. (2010) provided multiple lines of evidence establishing PHF8
as the first monomethyl histone H4 lysine-20 (H4K20me1) demethylase,
with additional activities towards histone H3K9me1 and me2. PHF8 is
located around the transcriptional start sites of approximately 7,000
RefSeq genes and in gene bodies and intergenic regions. PHF8 depletion
resulted in upregulation of H4K20me1 and H3K9me1 at the transcriptional
start site and H3K9me2 in the nontranscriptional start sites,
respectively, demonstrating differential substrate specificities at
different target locations. PHF8 positively regulates gene expression,
which is dependent on its H3K4me3-binding PHD and catalytic domains.
Importantly, patient mutations significantly compromised PHF8 catalytic
function. PHF8 regulates cell survival in the zebrafish brain and jaw
development, thus providing a potentially relevant biologic context for
understanding the clinical symptoms associated with PHF8 patients.
Lastly, genetic and molecular evidence supported a model whereby PHF8
regulates zebrafish neuronal cell survival and jaw development in part
by directly regulating the expression of the homeodomain transcription
factor MSX1/MSXB (605558), which functions downstream of multiple
signaling and developmental pathways. Qi et al. (2010) concluded that
their findings indicated that an imbalance of histone methylation
dynamics has a critical role in X-linked mental retardation.

Liu et al. (2010) reported that PHF8, while using multiple substrates,
including H3K9me1/2 and H3K27me2, also functions as an H4K20me1
demethylase.

PHF8 is recruited to promoters by its PHD domain based on interaction
with H3K4me2/3 and controls G1-S transition in conjunction with E2F1,
HCF1 (300019), and SET1A (611052), at least in part, by removing the
repressive H4K20me1 mark from a subset of E2F1-regulated gene promoters.
Phosphorylation-dependent PHF8 dismissal from chromatin in prophase is
apparently required for the accumulation of H4K20me1 during early
mitosis, which might represent a component of the condensin II loading
process. Accordingly, the HEAT repeat clusters in 2 non-structural
maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) condensin II subunits, NCAPD3 (609276)
and NCAPG2 (608532), are capable of recognizing H4K20me1, and ChIP-Seq
analysis demonstrated a significant overlap of condensin II and H4K20me1
sites in mitotic HeLa cells. Thus, Liu et al. (2010) concluded that the
identification and characterization of an H4K20me1 demethylase, PHF8,
has revealed an intimate link between this enzyme and 2 distinct events
in cell cycle progression.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In the affected males with Siderius X-linked mental retardation syndrome
(300263) reported by Siderius et al. (1999), Laumonnier et al. (2005)
identified a deletion in the PHF8 gene (300560.0001). Subsequent
screening of another family with mental retardation and similar clinical
features revealed a nonsense mutation in PHF8 (300560.0002).

Koivisto et al. (2007) identified a mutation in the PHF8 gene
(300560.0004) in 2 Finnish brothers with X-linked mental retardation and
cleft lip/cleft palate.

631C-T transition in exon 7 of the PHF8 gene, resulting in an
arg211-to-ter (R211X) substitution predicted to truncate the protein.
Three deceased maternal uncles had mental retardation and/or cleft lip

exon 6 of the PHF8 gene, resulting in a lys177-to-ter mutation. The
predicted protein lacks the Jumonji-like C terminus domain and 5 nuclear
localization signals. The proband's mother did not have the mutation,
indicating that the mutation occurred de novo.

In 2 Finnish brothers with X-linked mental retardation (300263),
Koivisto et al. (2007) identified a hemizygous 836C-T transition in the
PHF8 gene, resulting in a phe279-to-ser (F279S) substitution in the
Jumonji-like C terminus domain of the protein. The clinical phenotype
included mild mental retardation, facial dysmorphism, and cleft
lip/palate. The unaffected mother was a carrier of the mutation. Several
deceased male family members were reportedly affected.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

A major mechanism for the regulation of prostaglandin synthesis occurs
at the level of cyclooxygenase, also known as prostaglandin-endoperoxide
synthase (PTGS; EC 1.14.99.1). The first rate-limiting step in the
conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins is catalyzed by PTGS.
Two isoforms of PTGS have been identified: PTGS1 (COX1; 176805) and a
mitogen-inducible form, PTGS2. PTGS1 is involved in production of
prostaglandins for cellular housekeeping functions, whereas PTGS2 is
associated with biologic events such as injury, inflammation, and
proliferation (summary by Hla and Neilson (1992) and Tazawa et al.
(1994)).

CLONING

The antiinflammatory glucocorticoids are potent inhibitors of
cyclooxygenase, a key regulator of prostaglandin synthesis. To
investigate the mechanism of this inhibition, O'Banion et al. (1991,
1992) cloned a 4.1-kb mouse cDNA that conferred cyclooxygenase activity
to transfected cells. The mRNA of this cyclooxygenase, which O'Banion et
al. (1991, 1992) called Gripghs, was unique for its long 3-prime
untranslated region containing many AUUUA repeats. The 4.1-kb GRIPGHS
mRNA was rapidly increased by serum or interleukin-1-beta (IL1B; 147720)
in mouse fibroblasts and human monocytes, respectively, and decreased by
glucocorticoids, whereas levels of the 2.8-kb cyclooxygenase mRNA did
not change. O'Banion et al. (1991, 1992) concluded that the 2.8-kb
cyclooxygenase (PGHS1) is constitutive, whereas the 4.1-kb GRIPGHS is
regulated and is probably a major mediator of inflammation.

Hla and Neilson (1992) cloned COX2 from a human umbilical vein
endothelial cell (HUVEC) cDNA library. The deduced 604-amino acid
protein is 61% identical to human COX1 and 88% identical to mouse Cox2.
COX2 contains an N-terminal signal sequence, followed by a central
transmembrane region, a conserved active-site tyrosine, a conserved
aspirin acetylation site, and a C-terminal endoplasmic reticulum
retention signal. It also has several N-glycosylation sites, some of
which are conserved with COX1. In vitro translation of COX2 resulted in
a 70-kD protein. Northern blot analysis detected a 4.5-kb COX2
transcript in HUVECs. RT-PCR analysis revealed expression of COX2 and
COX1 in HUVECs, vascular smooth muscle cells, monocytes, and
fibroblasts.

Macchia et al. (1997) detected PGHS2 mRNA by Northern blot analysis of
term placenta. Western blot analysis using 3 highly specific antibodies
also found selective expression of PGHS2 immunoreactive protein in term
placenta. No PGHS1 was found in placenta.

Kirschenbaum et al. (2000) studied the immunohistochemical localization
of PTGS1 and PTGS2 in the human male fetal and adult reproductive
tracts. There was no PTGS1 expression in fetal samples (prostate,
seminal vesicles, or ejaculatory ducts), and only minimal expression in
adult tissues. There was no expression of PTGS2 in the fetal prostate.
In a prepubertal prostate there was some PTGS2 expression that localized
exclusively to the smooth muscle cells of the transition zone. In adult
hyperplastic prostates, PTGS2 was strongly expressed in smooth muscle
cells, with no expression in the luminal epithelial cells. PTGS2 was
strongly expressed in epithelial cells of both fetal and adult seminal
vesicles and ejaculatory ducts. The PTGS2 staining intensity in the
fetal ejaculatory ducts during various times of gestation correlated
with previously reported testosterone production rates by the fetal
testis. The authors concluded that PTGS2 is the predominant isoform
expressed in the fetal male reproductive tract, and its expression may
be regulated by androgens.

GENE FUNCTION

Hla and Neilson (1992) found that expression of human COX2 in COS-7
cells produced cyclooxygenase activity. COX2 mRNA was preferentially
induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and lipopolysaccharide
(LPS) in human endothelial cells and monocytes. This induction could be
partially inhibited by pretreatment with dexamethasone. In contrast,
COX1 showed minimal induction with LPS and PMA. Hla and Neilson (1992)
concluded that high-level induction of COX2 in mesenchymal-derived
inflammatory cells suggests a role for COX2 in inflammatory conditions.

Jones et al. (1993) found that stimulation of endothelial cells with TNF
(191160), PMA, LPS, or IL1 increased mRNA levels of PHS II, and this
change correlated with increased prostacyclin biosynthesis.
Cyclohexamide induced PHS II mRNA without a corresponding activity
increase, demonstrating that translation is required for enhanced
prostacyclin biosynthesis. Jones et al. (1993) concluded that expression
of PHS II may have important pathophysiologic effects in vasculature.

Tsujii and DuBois (1995) studied the effects of overexpressing COX2. Rat
intestinal epithelial (RIE) cells were stably transfected with a COX2
expression vector oriented in the sense (RIE-S) or antisense (RIE-AS)
direction. The RIE-S cells expressed elevated COX2 protein levels and
demonstrated increased adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins.
E-cadherin (192090) was undetectable in RIE-S cells, but was elevated in
parental RIE and RIE-AS cells. RIE-S cells were resistant to
butyrate-induced apoptosis, had elevated BCL2 (151430) protein
expression, and showed reduced transforming growth factor beta-2
receptor levels. The phenotypic changes involving both increased
adhesion to extracellular matrix and inhibition of apoptosis were
reversed by sulindac sulfide, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor. These studies
demonstrated that overexpression of COX2 leads to phenotypic changes in
intestinal epithelial cells that could enhance their tumorigenic
potential.

To explore the role of cyclooxygenase in endothelial cell migration and
angiogenesis, Tsujii et al. (1998) used 2 in vitro model systems
involving coculture of endothelial cells with colon carcinoma cells.
Cells overexpressing COX2 produced prostaglandins and proangiogenic
factors, and stimulated both endothelial migration and tube formation,
whereas control cells had little activity. The effect was inhibited by
antibodies to combinations of angiogenic factors, by NS-398 (a selective
COX2 inhibitor), and by aspirin. NS-398 did not inhibit production of
angiogenic factors or angiogenesis induced by COX2-negative cells.
Tsujii et al. (1998) also found that COX2 can modulate production of
angiogenic factors by colon cancer cells.

Zhou et al. (1999) found that culturing cells with highly purified human
chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) resulted in a time- and dose-dependent
increase in steady state levels of COX2 mRNA and protein and the
secretion of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Although human luteinizing hormone
(LH; see 152780) could mimic hCG, follicle-stimulating hormone (see
136530), thyroid-stimulating hormone (see 188540), and the alpha (CGA;
118850) and beta (CGB; 118860) subunits of hCG had no effect on COX2
protein levels. The authors concluded that hCG and LH treatment can
increase expression of COX2 in human endometrial gland epithelial cells;
the effect is time and dose dependent, hormone specific, and mediated by
the cAMP/type I protein kinase A signaling pathway; the hCG actions
require a normal complement of its receptors in cells; and these hCG and
LH effects may be another action of these hormones in human endometrium
that is important for implantation of the blastocyst and continuation of
pregnancy.

In a randomized control study comparing the effect of COX2 inhibitors
with nonselective NSAIDS upon the renal function of elderly subjects,
Swan et al. (2000) found that both agents cause a significant decrease
in the glomerular filtration rate. They concluded that COX2 therefore
seems to play an important role in human renal function.

Erkinheimo et al. (2000) investigated the expression of COX2 in human
myometrium. Myometrial samples collected from women in labor during
lower segment cesarean section expressed 15-fold higher levels of COX2
mRNA compared to myometrial specimens collected from women not in labor,
as detected by Northern blot analysis. Immunohistochemical detection of
COX2 protein showed cytoplasmic staining in the smooth muscle cells of
the myometrium. Cultured myometrial cells expressed low levels of COX2
mRNA under baseline conditions, but IL1-beta caused a 17-fold induction
of expression of the PTGS2 transcript after incubation for 6 hours.
IL1-beta also induced expression of biologically active COX2 protein, as
detected by immunofluorescence, Western blot analysis, and measuring the
conversion of arachidonic acid to prostanoids in the presence and
absence of a COX2-selective inhibitor, NS-398. PGE2 receptor subtype EP2
(176804) mRNA was expressed in cultured myometrial smooth muscle cells,
whereas transcripts for EP1 (176802), EP3 (176806), EP4 (601586), FP
(601204), and IP (600022) were low or below the detection limit as
measured by Northern blot analysis. However, IL1-beta stimulated
expression of EP4 receptor mRNA. The authors concluded that expression
of COX2 transcript is elevated at the onset of labor in myometrial
smooth muscle cells. This increase in expression may depend on
cytokines. As, in addition to COX2, the expression of prostanoid
receptors is regulated, not only the production of prostanoids, but also
responsiveness to them, may be modulated.

Inflammation causes the induction of COX2, leading to the release of
prostanoids, which sensitize peripheral nociceptor terminals and produce
localized pain hypersensitivity. Peripheral inflammation also generates
pain hypersensitivity in neighboring uninjured tissue, because of the
increased neuronal excitability in the spinal cord, and a syndrome
comprising diffuse muscle and joint pain, fever, lethargy, and anorexia.
Samad et al. (2001) showed that COX2 may be involved in central nervous
system (CNS) responses, by finding a widespread induction of COX2
expression in spinal cord neurons and in other regions of the CNS,
elevating prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) levels in the cerebrospinal fluid. The
major inducer of central COX2 upregulation is IL1-beta in the CNS, and
as basal phospholipase A2 (see 600522) activity in the CNS does not
change with peripheral inflammation, COX2 levels must regulate central
prostanoid production. In the rat, intraspinal administration of an
interleukin-converting enzyme or COX2 inhibitor decreased
inflammation-induced central PGE2 levels and mechanical hyperalgesia.
Thus, Samad et al. (2001) concluded that preventing central prostanoid
production by inhibiting the IL1-beta-mediated induction of COX2 in
neurons or by inhibiting central COX2 activity reduces centrally
generated inflammatory pain hypersensitivity.

Epithelial tumors may be regulated by COX enzyme products. To determine
if COX2 expression and PGE2 synthesis are upregulated in cervical
cancers, Sales et al. (2001) used real-time quantitative PCR and Western
blot analysis to confirm COX2 RNA and protein expression in squamous
cell carcinomas and adenocarcinomas. In contrast, minimal expression of
COX2 was detected in histologically normal cervix. Immunohistochemical
analyses localized COX2 expression and PGE2 synthesis to neoplastic
epithelial cells of all squamous cell carcinomas and adenocarcinomas
studied. Immunoreactive COX2 and PGE2 were also colocalized to
endothelial cells lining the microvasculature. To establish whether PGE2
has an autocrine/paracrine effect in cervical carcinomas, the authors
investigated the expression of 2 subtypes of PGE2 receptors, namely EP2
and EP4 by real-time quantitative PCR. Expression of EP2 and EP4
receptors was significantly higher in carcinoma tissue than in
histologically normal cervix. The authors concluded that COX2, EP2, and
EP4 expression and PGE2 synthesis are upregulated in cervical cancer
tissue and that PGE2 may regulate neoplastic cell function in cervical
carcinoma in an autocrine/paracrine manner via the EP2/EP4 receptors.

Lassus et al. (2000) performed COX2 immunohistochemistry on lung tissues
from autopsies of fetuses (16 to 32 weeks), preterm infants, term
infants, and infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). COX2
staining was found exclusively in the epithelial cells resembling type
II pneumocytes in the alveoli, and in ciliated epithelial cells in the
bronchi. COX2 staining occurred in a changing pattern: moderate
intensity staining in 90 to 100% of cells lining the alveolar epithelium
of fetuses; high intensity but scattered staining in cells of preterm
infants; less intense and fewer positive cells in term infants; and no
staining in alveolar epithelial cells of infants with BPD. COX2
bronchial epithelial staining was found in almost all fetal cells, in
approximately half of cells from preterm infants and infants with BPD,
and in fewer cells from term infants. The authors suggested that COX2
may play a developmental role in perinatal lung.

COX2 has been associated with carcinogenesis, and it is overexpressed in
many human malignancies. Salmenkivi et al. (2001) investigated the
expression of COX2 in normal adrenal gland, in 92 primary
pheochromocytomas, and in 6 metastases using immunohistochemistry and
Northern blot and Western blot analyses. COX2 protein was expressed in
the adrenal cortex, whereas the medulla was negative as detected by
immunohistochemistry. Interestingly, all 8 malignant pheochromocytomas,
regardless of the primary location of the tumor, showed moderate or
strong COX2 immunoreactivity, whereas 75% of the 36 benign adrenal
tumors showed no or only weak immunopositivity. The authors concluded
that normal adrenal medulla does not express COX2 immunohistochemically.
However, strong COX2 protein expression was found in malignant
pheochromocytomas, whereas most benign tumors expressed COX2 only
weakly. These findings suggested that negative or weak COX2 expression
in pheochromocytomas favors benign diagnosis.

Yokota et al. (2002) found that brown fat in normal human bone marrow
contains adiponectin (605441) and used marrow-derived preadipocyte lines
and long-term cultures to explore potential roles of adiponectin in
hematopoiesis. Recombinant adiponectin blocked fat cell formation in
long-term bone marrow cultures and inhibited the differentiation of
cloned stromal preadipocytes. Adiponectin also caused elevated
expression of COX2 by these stromal cells and induced release of
prostaglandin E2. A COX2 inhibitor prevented the inhibitory action of
adiponectin on preadipocyte differentiation, suggesting involvement of
stromal cell-derived prostanoids. Furthermore, adiponectin failed to
block fat cell generation when bone marrow cells were derived from COX2
heterozygous mice. Yokota et al. (2002) concluded that preadipocytes
represent direct targets for adiponectin action, establishing a
paracrine negative feedback loop for fat regulation. They also linked
adiponectin to the COX2-dependent prostaglandins that are critical in
this process.

Estrogen-induced responses in vascular cells have been shown to
influence prostaglandins and COX, a key enzyme in the production of
prostaglandins that has 2 isoforms, COX1 and COX2. Calkin et al. (2002)
investigated the effects of prostaglandins on the acute potentiation by
17-beta-estradiol of acetylcholine (ACh)-mediated vasodilation in the
cutaneous vasculature. Acute 17-beta-estradiol administration enhanced
the response to ACh after aspirin, diclofenac, and placebo; however,
this effect was completely abolished with treatment with celecoxib, a
specific COX2 inhibitor p less than 0.05). The authors concluded that
the COX2 pathway plays a specific role in the rapid
17-beta-estradiol-induced potentiation of cholinergic vasodilation in
postmenopausal women.

COX2 expression is translationally silenced in epithelial cells
undergoing radiation-induced apoptosis. Mukhopadhyay et al. (2003) found
that CUGBP2 (602538), a predominantly nuclear protein, is also rapidly
induced in response to radiation and translocates to the cytoplasm.
Antisense-mediated suppression of CUGBP2 rendered radioprotection
through a COX2-dependent prostaglandin pathway, providing an in vivo
demonstration of translation inhibition activity for CUGBP2. CUGBP2
bound to 2 sets of AU-rich sequences located within the first 60
nucleotides of the COX2 3-prime untranslated region (UTR). Upon binding,
CUGBP2 stabilized a chimeric luciferase-COX2 3-prime UTR mRNA but
inhibited its translation. These findings identified a novel paradigm
for RNA-binding proteins in facilitating opposing functions of mRNA
stability and translation inhibition and revealed a mechanism for
inhibiting COX2 expression in cancer cells.

Qin et al. (2003) found that expression of COX1 or COX2 in hamster and
human cells exogenously and endogenously expressing human amyloid
precursor protein (APP; 104760) induced production of the amyloid
peptides A-beta(1-40) and A-beta(1-42), as well as the
gamma-secretase-generated C-terminal fragment of APP. Peptide production
was coincident with the secretion of prostaglandin-E2 into the culture
medium. Treatment of APP-overexpressing cells with ibuprofen or with a
specific gamma-secretase inhibitor significantly attenuated COX1- and
COX2-mediated APP peptide production.

In rat hippocampal slices, Kim and Alger (2004) found evidence
suggesting that COX2 limits endocannabinoid action and signaling between
neurons.

Xu et al. (2004) demonstrated that activated T cells of patients with
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE; 152700) resisted anergy and apoptosis
by markedly upregulating and sustaining COX2 expression. Inhibition of
COX2 caused apoptosis of the anergy-resistant lupus T cells by
augmenting FAS (134637) signaling and markedly decreasing the survival
molecule FLIP (603599), and this mechanism was found to involve
anergy-resistant lupus T cells selectively. Xu et al. (2004) noted that
the COX2 gene is located in a lupus susceptibility region on chromosome
1. They also found that only some COX2 inhibitors were able to suppress
the production of pathogenic autoantibodies to DNA by causing autoimmune
T-cell apoptosis, an effect that was independent of PGE2.

Egan et al. (2004) reported that estrogen acts on estrogen receptor
subtype alpha (133430) to upregulate the production of atheroprotective
prostacyclin (PGI2) by activation of COX2. This mechanism restrained
both oxidant stress and platelet activation that contribute to
atherogenesis in female mice. Deletion of the Pgi2 receptor removed the
atheroprotective effect of estrogen in ovariectomized female mice. Egan
et al. (2004) concluded that this suggested that chronic treatment of
patients with selective inhibitors of COX2 could undermine protection
from cardiovascular disease in premenopausal females.

Kothapalli et al. (2004) investigated the antimitogenic effect of high
density lipoprotein (HDL) on the inhibition of S-phase entry of murine
aortic smooth muscle cells, which they found to be mediated by
apolipoprotein E (APOE; 107741). They also demonstrated that specific
inhibition of Cox2 blocks the antimitogenic effects of HDL and Apoe,
that both HDL and Apoe induce Cox2 gene expression, and that the
prostacyclin receptor IP (600022) is required for the antimitogenic
effects of HDL and Apoe. Kothapalli et al. (2004) concluded that the
COX2 gene is a target of APOE signaling, linking HDL and APOE to IP
action, and suggested that this mechanism may contribute to the
cardioprotective effect of HDL and APOE.

By in vivo selection, transcriptomic analysis, functional verification,
and clinical validation, Minn et al. (2005) identified a set of genes
that marks and mediates breast cancer metastasis to the lungs. Some of
these genes serve dual functions, providing growth advantages both in
the primary tumor and in the lung microenvironment. Others contribute to
aggressive growth selectivity in the lung. Among the lung metastasis
signature genes identified, several, including PTGS2, were functionally
validated. Those subjects expressing the lung metastasis signature had a
significantly poorer lung metastasis-free survival, but not bone
metastasis-free survival, compared to subjects without the signature.

Liu et al. (2004) found that nitric oxide (NO) induced COX2 expression
in a human colorectal cell line and in nontransformed mouse colon
epithelial cells. NO-induced induction was due to PEA3 (ETV4;
600711)-p300 (EP300; 602700)-mediated activation of an ETS site and an
NFIL6 (CEBPB; 189965)-binding site in the COX2 promoter.

Kim et al. (2005) showed that inducible NO synthase (iNOS; 163730)
specifically binds to COX2 and S-nitrosylates it, enhancing COX2
catalytic activity. Selectively disrupting iNOS-COX2 binding prevented
NO-mediated activation of COX2. Kim et al. (2005) suggested that the
molecular synergism between iNOS and COX2 may represent a major
mechanism of inflammatory responses.

Metastasis entails numerous biologic functions that collectively enable
cancerous cells from a primary site to disseminate and overtake distant
organs. Using genetic and pharmacologic approaches, Gupta et al. (2007)
showed that the epidermal growth factor receptor ligand epiregulin
(602061), the cyclooxygenase COX2, and the matrix metalloproteinases
MMP1 (120353) and MMP2 (120360), when expressed in human breast cancer
cells, collectively facilitate the assembly of new tumor blood vessels,
the release of tumor cells into the circulation, and the breaching of
lung capillaries by circulating tumor cells to seed pulmonary
metastasis. Gupta et al. (2007) concluded that their findings revealed
how aggressive primary tumorigenic functions can be mechanistically
coupled to greater lung metastatic potential, and how such biologic
activities can be therapeutically targeted with specific drug
combinations.

To identify new modulators of hematopoietic stem cell formation and
homeostasis, North et al. (2007) screened a panel of biologically active
compounds for effects on stem cell induction in the zebrafish
aorta-gonad-mesonephros region. The authors showed that chemicals that
enhance prostaglandin E2 synthesis increased hematopoietic stem cell
numbers, and those that blocked prostaglandin synthesis decreased stem
cell numbers. The cyclooxygenases responsible for PGE2 synthesis were
required for hematopoietic stem cell formation. A stable derivative of
PGE2 improved kidney marrow recovery following irradiation injury in
adult zebrafish. In murine embryonic stem cell differentiation assays,
PGE2 caused amplification of multipotent progenitors. Furthermore, in
vivo exposure to stabilized PGE2 enhanced spleen colony-forming units at
day 12 post transplant and increased the frequency of long-term
repopulating hematopoietic stem cells present in murine bone marrow
after limiting dilution competitive transplantation. The conserved role
for PGE2 in the regulation of vertebrate hematopoietic stem cell
homeostasis indicates that modulation of the prostaglandin pathway may
facilitate expansion of hematopoietic stem cell number for therapeutic
purposes.

Using RT-PCR, Pan et al. (2008) showed that both COX2 and CCR7 (600242)
were upregulated in a significant number of breast tumor samples
compared with adjacent normal tissue, and that this upregulation was
associated with enhanced lymph node metastasis. Overexpression and
knockdown studies in human breast cancer cell lines revealed that COX2
acted via the prostaglandin receptors EP2 (PTGER2; 176804) and EP4
(PTGER4; 601586), resulting in increased intracellular cAMP and
activation of the PKA (see 188830)-AKT (see 164730) signaling pathway,
which led to induction of CCR7 expression. Elevated CCR7 enhanced the
migration of breast cancer cells toward lymphatic endothelial cells,
suggesting that CCR7 upregulation ultimately mediates COX2-associated
lymph node metastasis.

Bos et al. (2009) isolated cells that preferentially infiltrate the
brain from patients with advanced breast cancer. Gene expression
analysis of these cells and of clinical samples, coupled with functional
analysis, identified the cyclooxygenase COX2, the epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR; 131550) ligand HBEGF (126150), and the
alpha-2,6-sialyltransferase ST6GALNAC5 (610134) as mediators of cancer
cell passage through the blood-brain barrier. EGFR ligands and COX2 had
been linked to breast cancer infiltration of the lungs, but not the
bones or liver, suggesting a sharing of these mediators in cerebral and
pulmonary metastases. In contrast, ST6GALNAC5 specifically mediates
brain metastasis. Normally restricted to the brain, the expression of
ST6GALNAC5 in breast cancer cells enhances their adhesion to brain
endothelial cells and their passage through the blood-brain barrier.
This co-option of a brain sialyltransferase highlights the role of cell
surface glycosylation in organ-specific metastatic interactions. Bos et
al. (2009) demonstrated that breast cancer metastasis to the brain
involves mediators of extravasation through nonfenestrated capillaries,
complemented by specific enhancers of blood-brain barrier crossing and
brain colonization.

The acetylation of COX2 by aspirin enables the biosynthesis of
R-containing precursors of endogenous antiinflammatory mediators termed
resolvins (Serhan et al., 2002). Spite et al. (2009) established the
complete stereochemistry of endogenous resolvin-D2 and its potent
stereoselective actions facilitating resolution of inflammatory sepsis.

Coward et al. (2009) found that expression of COX2 mRNA and protein and
production of PGE2 was induced by TGF-beta-1 (TGFB1; 190180) and IL1B in
cultured normal lung fibroblasts, but not in fibroblasts cultured from
lung tissue of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF;
178500). They showed that defective histone acetylation was responsible
for diminished COX2 transcription in IPF.

Using mouse models, Vegiopoulos et al. (2010) showed that COX2, a
rate-limiting enzyme in prostaglandin synthesis, is a downstream
effector of beta-adrenergic signaling in white adipose tissue and is
required for the induction of brown adipose tissue in white adipose
tissue depots. Prostaglandin shifted the differentiation of defined
mesenchymal progenitors toward a brown adipocyte phenotype.
Overexpression of COX2 in white adipose tissue induced de novo brown
adipose tissue recruitment in white adipose tissue, increased systemic
energy expenditure, and protected mice against high fat diet-induced
obesity. Thus, Vegiopoulos et al. (2010) concluded that COX2 appears
integral to de novo brown adipose tissue recruitment, which suggests
that the prostaglandin pathway regulates systemic energy homeostasis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Tazawa et al. (1994) isolated the entire PGHS2 gene and its 5-prime
flanking region and showed that it contains 10 exons and spans 7.5 kb.
By comparison, the murine and human PGHS1 genes comprise 11 exons and 10
introns and are approximately 22 kb long (Kraemer et al., 1992).

Kosaka et al. (1994) determined that the PTGS2 gene contains 10 coding
exons and spans more than 8.3 kb. The upstream region and intron 1
contain a canonical TATA box and various transcriptional regulatory
elements, including a functional cAMP response element.

MAPPING

Jones et al. (1993) and Tazawa et al. (1994) mapped the PTGS2 gene to
chromosome 1. By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Tay et al. (1994)
mapped the PTGS2 gene to chromosome 1q25. Using FISH, Kosaka et al.
(1994) mapped the PTGS2 gene to chromosome 1q25.2-q25.3.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Fritsche et al. (2001) sequenced the COX2 gene from 72 individuals and
identified no functionally important polymorphisms. They suggested that
there has been selective pressure against such SNPs because of the
critical role of COX2 in the maintenance of homeostasis.

CLINICAL MANAGEMENT

Xia et al. (2012) showed that prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) silences certain
tumor suppressor and DNA repair genes through DNA methylation to promote
tumor growth. Their findings uncovered a theretofore unrecognized role
for PGE2 in the promotion of tumor progression, and provided a rationale
for considering the development of a combination treatment using PTGS2
inhibitors and demethylating agents for the prevention or treatment of
colorectal cancer.

ANIMAL MODEL

Morham et al. (1995) noted that COX2 is induced at high levels in
migratory and other responding cells by proinflammatory stimuli. COX2 is
generally considered to be a mediator of inflammation. Its isoform,
COX1, is constitutively expressed in most tissues and is thought to
mediate housekeeping functions. These 2 enzymes are therapeutic targets
of the widely used nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). To
investigate further the different physiologic roles of these isoforms,
Morham et al. (1995) used homologous recombination to disrupt the mouse
gene encoding Cox2 (Ptgs2). Mice lacking Cox2 were found to have normal
inflammatory responses to treatments with tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate
or arachidonic acid. However, they developed severe nephropathy and were
susceptible to peritonitis.

Oshima et al. (1996) bred mice carrying an APC (611731) mutation (a
truncation at residue 716) that causes adenomatous polyposis coli
closely mimicking that in the human with mice with a disrupted Ptgs2
gene. All the animals were APC heterozygotes; if homozygous for wildtype
Ptgs2, they developed an average of 652 polyps at 10 weeks, while
heterozygotes had 224 polyps and homozygously deficient mice had only 93
polyps. This experiment provided definitive genetic evidence that
induction of Ptgs2 is an early rate-limiting step for adenoma formation.
They showed also that a drug which inhibits the COX2 isoform encoded by
Ptgs2, but not COX1, also markedly reduced the number of polyps. Thus,
Oshima et al. (1996) concluded that overexpression of COX2 is an early,
central event in carcinogenesis.

Lim et al. (1997) generated COX2-deficient mice by gene targeting. These
mice showed multiple failures in female reproductive processes that
included ovulation, fertilization, implantation, and decidualization.
The authors concluded that the defects in these mice were the direct
result of target organ-specific COX2 deficiency and not the result of
deficiency of pituitary gonadotropins or ovarian steroid hormones, or
reduced responsiveness of the target organs to their respective
hormones.

The transition to pulmonary respiration following birth requires rapid
alterations in the structure of the mammalian cardiovascular system. A
dramatic change that occurs is the closure and remodeling of the ductus
arteriosus (DA; see 607411), an arterial connection in the fetus that
directs blood flow away from the pulmonary circulation. A role of
prostaglandins in regulating the closure of this vessel is supported by
pharmacologic and genetic studies. The production of prostaglandins is
dependent on COX1 and COX2. Loftin et al. (2001) reported that the
absence of either or both COX isoforms in mice did not result in
premature closure of the DA in utero. However, 35% of COX2 -/- mice died
with a patent DA within 48 hours of birth. In contrast, the absence of
only the COX1 isoform did not affect closure of the DA. The mortality
and patent DA incidence due to absence of COX2 was, however, increased
to 79% when one copy of the gene encoding COX1 was also inactivated.
Furthermore, 100% of the mice deficient in both isoforms died with a
patent DA within 12 hours of birth, indicating that in COX2-deficient
mice, the contribution of COX1 to DA closure is gene dosage-dependent.
Together, these data established roles for COX1 and especially for COX2
in the transition of the cardiopulmonary circulation at birth.

See also 176805 for the work of Gavett et al. (1999) on allergen-induced
pulmonary inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness in wildtype mice
and in Ptgs1 -/- and Ptgs2 -/- mice.

In mice and humans, deregulated expression of COX2, but not of COX1, is
characteristic of epithelial tumors, including squamous cell carcinomas
of skin. To explore the function of COX2 in epidermis, Neufang et al.
(2001) used a keratin-5 (148040) promoter to direct COX2 expression to
the basal cells of interfollicular epidermis and the pilosebaceous
appendage of transgenic mouse skin. Cox2 overexpression in the expected
locations, resulting in increased prostaglandin levels in epidermis and
plasma, correlated with a pronounced skin phenotype. Heterozygous
transgenic mice exhibited a reduced hair follicle density. Moreover,
postnatal hair follicle morphogenesis and thinning of interfollicular
dorsal epidermis were delayed. Adult transgenics showed a body
site-dependent sparse coat of greasy hair, the latter caused by
sebaceous gland hyperplasia and increased epicutaneous sebum levels. In
tail skin, hyperplasia of scale epidermis reflecting an increased number
of viable and cornified cell layers was observed. Hyperplasia was a
result of a disturbed program of epidermal differentiation rather than
an increased proliferation rate, as reflected by the strong suppression
of keratin-10 (148080), involucrin (147360), and loricrin (152445)
expression in suprabasal cells. Further pathologic signs were loss of
cell polarity, mainly of basal keratinocytes, epidermal invaginations
into the dermis, and formation of horn perls. Invaginating hyperplastic
lobes were surrounded by vessels testing positive for CD31,
platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (173445).

In a mouse model of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), Wilkinson-Berka et
al. (2003) found that Cox2 was localized to sites associated with
retinal blood vessels. The selective Cox2 inhibitor rofecoxib attenuated
retinal angiogenesis that accompanied ROP. Normal retinal development
indicated that COX2 plays an important role in blood vessel formation in
the developing retina.

Brewer et al. (2003) generated healthy mice lacking glucocorticoid
receptor (GCCR; 138040) only in T cells and thymus. Gccr was dispensable
for T-cell development, but administration of a T-cell stimulus or
superantigen to mutant mice, but not control mice, resulted in high
mortality that could not be rescued by dexamethasone or anti-Ifng
(147570). Microarray and ribonuclease protection analyses suggested that
endogenous glucocorticoids are required for transcriptional suppression
of Ifng, but not Tnf or Il2 (147680), in T cells. Inhibition of Cox2
protected mice from lethality without affecting Ifng levels. Histologic
analysis revealed that T-cell stimulation in mutant mice caused
significant damage to the gastrointestinal tract, particularly the
cecum, but little or no damage in other tissues. Brewer et al. (2003)
concluded that Gccr function in T cells is essential for survival during
polyclonal T-cell activation. Furthermore, they suggested that Cox2
inhibition may be useful for treatment of glucocorticoid insufficiency
or resistance in patients with toxic shock syndrome (see 607395),
graft-versus-host disease (GVHD; see 614395), or other T-cell activating
processes.

Liu et al. (2001) generated transgenic mice that overexpressed the human
COX2 gene in the mammary glands using the murine mammary tumor virus
promoter. The human COX2 mRNA and protein were expressed in mammary
glands of female transgenic mice and were strongly induced during
pregnancy and lactation. Multiparous but not virgin females exhibited a
greatly exaggerated incidence of focal mammary gland hyperplasia,
dysplasia, and transformation into metastatic tumors. COX2-induced tumor
tissue expressed reduced levels of the pro-apoptotic proteins BAX
(600040) and BCLXL (600039) and an increase in the anti-apoptotic
protein BCL2, suggesting that decreased apoptosis of mammary epithelial
cells contributes to tumorigenesis. Liu et al. (2001) concluded that
enhanced COX2 expression is sufficient to induce mammary gland
tumorigenesis.

Using Cox1 -/- and Cox2 -/- mice, Zhang et al. (2002) demonstrated that
COX2 plays a role in both endochondral and intramembranous bone
formation during skeletal repair. Healing of stabilized tibia fractures
was significantly delayed in Cox2 -/- mice compared with Cox1 -/- and
wildtype mice. Cultured Cox2 -/- bone marrow stromal cells showed a
defect in osteogenesis that could be completely rescued by addition of
prostaglandin E2. Addition of Bmp2 (112261) enhanced bone formation to a
level above that observed with prostaglandin E2 alone in both wildtype
and Cox2 -/- cells, indicating the BMP2 is downstream of prostaglandin
production. Expression of Cbfa1 (RUNX2; 600211) and osterix (SP7;
606633) was downregulated in Cox2 -/- cells. Addition of prostaglandin
E2 rescued this defect, and Bmp2 enhanced Cbfa1 and osterix in Cox2 -/-
and wildtype cells. Zhang et al. (2002) concluded that COX2 regulates
induction of CBFA1 and osterix to mediate normal skeletal repair.

Zhang et al. (2003) generated a transgenic mouse model overexpressing
TGM2 (190196) in cardiomyocytes and found that the mice had an
age-dependent left ventricular hypertrophy and cardiac decompensation,
characterized by cardiomyocyte apoptosis and fibrosis and a delayed
impact on survival. Expression of COX2, thromboxane synthase (274180),
and the thromboxane receptor (188070) were increased coincident with the
emergence of the cardiac phenotype. The COX2-dependent increase in
thromboxane A2 augmented cardiac hypertrophy, whereas formation of PGI2
by the same isozyme, as well as administration of COX2 inhibitors,
rescued the cardiac phenotype. Zhang et al. (2003) concluded that TGM2
activation regulates expression of COX2, and that its products may
differentially modulate cell death or survival of cardiomyocytes.

Boccaccio et al. (2005) developed a mouse model of sporadic
tumorigenesis in which they targeted the activated human MET oncogene
(164860) to adult liver. They observed slowly progressive
hepatocarcinogenesis, which was preceded and accompanied by a
disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)-like thrombohemorrhagic
syndrome. Genomewide expression profiling of MLP29 cells transduced with
the activated MET oncogene revealed prominent upregulation of
plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI1; 173360) and COX2, and in vivo
administration of a PAI1 or COX2 inhibitor slowed the evolution towards
full-blown DIC. Boccaccio et al. (2005) concluded that this study
provided the first direct genetic evidence for the link between oncogene
activation and hemostasis.

Brown et al. (2007) found that Myd88 (602170) -/- mice and Ptgs2 -/-
mice exhibited a profound inhibition of endothelial proliferation and
cellular organization within rectal crypts after injury. The effects of
injury in both mutant mouse strains could be rescued by exogenous PGE2,
suggesting that Myd88 signaling is upstream of Ptgs2 and PGE2. In
wildtype mice, the combination of injury and Myd88 signaling led to
repositioning of a subset of Ptgs2-expressing stromal cells from the
mesenchyme surrounding the middle and upper crypts to an area
surrounding the crypt base adjacent to colonic epithelial progenitor
cells. Brown et al. (2007) concluded that the MYD88 and prostaglandin
signaling pathways interact to preserve epithelial proliferation during
injury, and that proper cellular mobilization within the crypt niche is
critical to repair after injury.

Vardeh et al. (2009) observed that mice with conditional deletion of
Cox2 in neurons and glial cells, but not in peripheral immune cells,
showed no difference in basal nociception to mechanical or thermal pain
sensitivity from wildtype mice. There was also no difference in fever
induction. However, after induction of peripheral inflammation, mutant
mice had loss of Cox2 expression in the spinal cord and showed loss of
mechanical hypersensivity. The findings suggested that induction of Cox2
in neural cells in the central nervous system contributes to mechanical
pain hypersensitivity after peripheral inflammation, as is seen in
postoperative pain and arthritis. Peripheral Cox2 induction appears to
regulate thermal hypersensitivity, such as seen in sunburn or other
dermatologic conditions.

Shim et al. (2010) found that transgenic mice overexpressing human COX2
died shortly after birth, likely due to inability to inflate lungs.
Transgenic embryos exhibited severe skeletal malformations, generalized
edema, midfacial hypoplasia, and occasional umbilical hernia. The
skeletal defects were due to abnormal apoptosis of sclerotomal cells in
early embryonic development, which resulted in impaired precartilaginous
sclerotomal condensation.

602516	TITLE *602516 REGULATOR OF G PROTEIN SIGNALING 4; RGS4
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins have been shown to
accelerate the GTPase activities of G protein alpha-subunits, thus
driving G proteins into their inactive GDP-bound forms. See 602189 for
further background information.

CLONING

By searching for homologs of the yeast SST2 gene product, which
regulates G protein signaling, Druey et al. (1996) cloned RGS4 cDNAs
from rat and human brain cDNA libraries. The human RGS4 cDNA encodes a
predicted 205-amino acid protein that is 97% identical to rat Rgs4.
Northern blot analysis detected a single human RGS4 transcript that was
expressed exclusively in brain. RGS4 partially complemented a yeast SST2
mutation, but it required the G protein alpha-subunit to function. Druey
et al. (1996) suggested that RGS4, and presumably other RGSs, negatively
regulate signaling upstream or at the level of the heterotrimeric G
protein.

Koelle and Horvitz (1996) cloned a human RGS4 cDNA by searching for
homologs of the C. elegans egl-10 gene (see 602517).

Using RT-PCR, Ruiz de Azua et al. (2010) found that Rgs4 was highly
expressed in the MIN6 murine insulinoma cell line and in mouse
pancreatic islets.

GENE FUNCTION

Ruiz de Azua et al. (2010) showed that knockdown of Rgs4 in MIN6 cells
caused a concentration-dependent increase in intracellular calcium,
increased basal insulin release, and enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin
secretion. Rgs4 coimmunoprecipitated with M3 muscarinic receptor (M3R,
or CHRM3; 118494) from transfected COS-7 cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Sierra et al. (2002) determined that RGS4 contains 5 exons and spans 5.5
kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Sierra et al. (2002) mapped the RGS4 gene
to chromosome 1q23.3. They mapped the mouse Rgs4 gene to chromosome 1 by
interspecific backcross mapping.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

For discussion of a possible association between variation in the RGS4
gene and schizophrenia, see 181500.

ANIMAL MODEL

Ruiz de Azua et al. (2010) found that Rgs4 deficiency in mice enhanced
M3r-mediated insulin secretion. Pancreatic beta cell-specific Rgs4
knockout did not alter basal glucose levels, but it increased plasma
insulin levels and increased insulin release after administration of a
muscarinic agonist. Ruiz de Azua et al. (2010) concluded that RGS4 acts
as a negative regulator of M3R signaling in pancreatic beta cells.

601529	TITLE *601529 NUCLEAR RECEPTOR SUBFAMILY 2, GROUP C, MEMBER 1; NR2C1
;;NUCLEAR HORMONE RECEPTOR TR2; TR2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Chang and Kokontis (1988) used an oligonucleotide probe based on the
zinc finger DNA-binding domain of steroid receptors to isolate a
putative steroid receptor, termed TR2, from a human testis cDNA library.
Subsequent studies (Chang et al., 1989) showed that several splice
variants of TR2 exist and the original TR2 clone was renamed TR2-5.
Northern blot analysis by Chang and Kokontis (1988) showed that TR2-5
produced a 2.5-kb transcript that was abundant in androgen-sensitive
organs, such as ventral prostate and seminal vesicle. Dot blot
hybridization indicated that TR2-5 mRNA levels increased after
castration of rats and that this increase was reversed by
5-alpha-dihydrotestosterone injection. Expression of TR2-5 resulted in a
52-kD protein.

Chang et al. (1989) described 4 splice variants of the TR2 gene, TR2-5,
TR2-7, TR2-9, and TR2-11, which encode proteins of 483, 184, 467, and
603 amino acids, respectively. All were isolated from human testis or
prostate cDNA libraries. The DNA-binding domains of the 4 variants are
identical and share 50 to 60% amino acid identity with other steroid
receptors. The TR2-7 receptor has no apparent hormone-binding region,
whereas the other 3 variants have the same hormone-binding region
followed by variant C termini. In vitro transcription and translation of
the TR2-11 receptor indicated that this receptor did not bind any known
steroids, suggesting to Chang et al. (1989) that this receptor could be
steroid independent or dependent on an unknown hormone. The authors
noted that the identity of the DNA-binding regions of these receptors
suggests that they regulate the same target gene(s), but the differences
in the C termini may allow them to bind different ligands or bind the
same ligand with differing affinities. By analogy to the splice variants
of the thyroid hormone receptor, the authors suggested that the
expression ratio of the TR2 splice variants could vary in a
tissue-specific or developmental stage-specific manner regulated at the
level of RNA splicing.

GENE FUNCTION

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Lee et al. (1998) identified an
interaction between mouse Tr2 and Rip140 (NRIP1; 602490). By mutation
analysis, they determined that the LxxLL motifs of mouse Rip140
interacted with the activation function-2 region of Tr2.
Coimmunoprecipitation experiments detected interaction between the 2
proteins in cell extracts. Rip140 repressed binding of Tr2 to target
DNA. In the presence of Rip140, Tr2 translocated into the nucleus.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the NR2C1
gene to chromosome 12 (TMAP STS-H68838).

ANIMAL MODEL

Shyr et al. (2002) detected Tr2 expression in mice at 3 weeks of age,
and the expression was restricted mainly to spermatocytes and round
spermatids. They found that mice lacking Tr2 were viable with no serious
developmental defects. Male mice lacking Tr2 had functional testes,
including normal sperm number and motility, and both male and female
mice lacking Tr2 were fertile.

605677	TITLE *605677 ACYL-CoA SYNTHETASE LONG CHAIN FAMILY, MEMBER 5; ACSL5
;;FATTY ACID CoA LIGASE, LONG CHAIN 5; FACL5;;
ACYL-CoA SYNTHETASE 5; ACS5
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Acyl-CoA synthetases (ACSs; EC 6.2.1.3), such as ACSL5, catalyze the
formation of acyl-CoA from fatty acid, ATP, and CoA. This reaction is
essential in mammalian fatty acid metabolism. In addition, ACSs mediates
transportation of fatty acids into cells by cooperating with the fatty
acid transporter protein (FATP; 600691) (summary by Watkins et al.,
2007).

CLONING

Oikawa et al. (1998) cloned rat Acs5 and found that it is highly
expressed in proliferating 3T3-L1 cells. By screening a liver cDNA
library with rat ACS5 as the probe, Yamashita et al. (2000) isolated a
cDNA encoding human ACS5. The deduced 683-amino acid protein shares
approximately 80% amino acid identity with the rat sequence. Northern
blot analysis detected 2 major ACS5 transcripts of 2.5 and 3.7 kb in a
wide range of tissues, with highest expression in uterus and spleen.

By searching databases for sequences containing acyl-CoA synthetase
motifs 1 and 2, Watkins et al. (2007) identified 3 splice variants of
human ACSL5. The full-length protein contains 739 amino acids. The 2
other splice variants differ from each other only in their 5-prime UTRs
and encode an N-terminally truncated protein of 683 amino acids.
Phylogenetic analysis revealed that ACSL5 belongs to a family of long
chain acyl-CoA synthetases.

GENE FUNCTION

Markedly increased levels of ACS5 transcripts were detected in a glioma
line and in primary gliomas of grade IV malignancy, while ACS5
expression was found to be low in normal brain. Yamashita et al. (2000)
found that cultured glioma cells infected with an adenovirus encoding
ACS5 displayed induced cell growth on exposure to palmitate. Consistent
with the induction of cell growth, the virus-infected cells displayed
induced uptake of palmitate. These results demonstrated a novel fatty
acid-induced glioma cell growth mediated by ACS5.

GENE STRUCTURE

Using BAC and YAC clones, Yamashita et al. (2000) determined that the
ACS5 gene spans approximately 46 kb and contains 21 exons.

MAPPING

Yamashita et al. (2000) determined that the 3-prime UTR of ACS5 contains
a specific STS marker that maps to 10q25.1-q25.2, a region frequently
deleted in malignant gliomas (see 601969).

Watkins et al. (2007) mapped the ACSL5 gene to the plus strand of
chromosome 10q25.1-q25.2 by genomic sequence analysis.

603732	TITLE *603732 CRYPTOCHROME 2; CRY2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Hsu et al. (1996) identified a human gene, CRY2, whose product had 73%
amino acid identity to the human (6-4)photolyase (CRY1; 601933). The
CRY2 protein shares 51% amino acid sequence identity to Drosophila
(6-4)photolyase. Hsu et al. (1996) purified the human CRY1 and CRY2
proteins and characterized them as maltose-binding fusion proteins that
contain FAD and a pterin cofactor. Both CRY1 and CRY2 proteins lacked
photolyase activity. Hsu et al. (1996) concluded that these proteins are
not photolyases, but may function as blue-light photoreceptors in
humans.

As part of a search for human brain cDNA clones with the potential to
encode large proteins in vitro, Ishikawa et al. (1998) independently
identified CRY2. The CRY2 open reading frame encodes a protein of 589
amino acids with an apparent molecular mass of 67 kD.

Kobayashi et al. (1998) isolated and characterized mouse Cry1 and Cry2.
While Cry1 is localized to the mitochondria, Cry2 is found mainly in the
nucleus. The C termini of both mouse Cry2 and human CRY2 each contain a
nuclear localization signal, and the N terminus of mouse Cry1 contains a
mitochondrial transport signal. Cry1 protein bound tightly to DNA
Sepharose, while Cry2 protein did not.

GENE FUNCTION

Griffin et al. (1999) showed that human CRY1 and CRY2 act as
light-independent inhibitors of a heterodimeric activator consisting of
CLOCK (601851) and BMAL1 (602550), the activator driving Per1 (602260)
transcription, very likely by means of direct contacts between CRY1 and
BMAL1 and between CRY2 and CLOCK. They concluded that CRY1 and CRY2
occupy a central position within the mammalian circadian clock,
virtually at the interface between CLOCK-BMAL1 and PER1, PER2 (603426),
and TIM (603887). Griffin et al. (1999) suggested that Drosophila CRY
exemplifies the ancestral role of the photoreceptor acting as a
light-dependent regulator of the circadian feedback loop, whereas
mammalian CRYs have preserved the role within the circadian feedback
loop but have shed their direct photoreceptor function.

Kume et al. (1999) determined that the mouse Cry1 and Cry2 genes act in
the negative limb of the clock feedback loop. They stated that mouse
Cry1 and Cry2 are nuclear proteins that interact with each of the Per
proteins, translocate each Per protein from cytoplasm to nucleus, and
are rhythmically expressed in the suprachiasmatic circadian clock.
Luciferase reporter gene assays showed that Cry1 or Cry2 alone abrogates
Clock/Bmal1 (602550) E box-mediated transcription. The mouse Per and Cry
proteins appeared to inhibit the transcriptional complex differentially.

Etchegaray et al. (2003) demonstrated that transcriptional regulation of
the core clock mechanism in mouse liver is accompanied by rhythms in H3
histone (see 602810) acetylation, and that H3 acetylation is a potential
target of the inhibitory action of Cry. The promoter regions of the
Per1, Per2, and Cry1 genes exhibited circadian rhythms in H3 acetylation
and RNA polymerase II (see 180660) binding that were synchronous with
the corresponding steady-state mRNA rhythms. The histone
acetyltransferase p300 (602700) precipitated with Clock in vivo in a
time-dependent manner. Moreover, the Cry proteins inhibited a
p300-induced increase in Clock/Bmal1-mediated transcription. Etchegaray
et al. (2003) concluded that the delayed timing of the Cry1 mRNA rhythm,
relative to the Per rhythms, was due to the coordinated activities of
Rev-Erb-alpha (602408) and Clock/Bmal1, and defined a novel mechanism
for circadian phase control.

Lamia et al. (2011) showed that 2 circadian coregulators, Cry1 (601933)
and Cry2, interact with glucocorticoid receptor (138040) in a
ligand-dependent fashion and globally alter the transcriptional response
to glucocorticoids in mouse embryonic fibroblasts: cryptochrome
deficiency vastly decreases gene repression and approximately doubles
the number of dexamethasone-induced genes, suggesting that cryptochromes
broadly oppose glucocorticoid receptor activation and promote
repression. In mice, genetic loss of Cry1 and/or 2 results in glucose
intolerance and constitutively high levels of circulating
corticosterone, suggesting reduced suppression of the
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis coupled with increased
glucocorticoid transactivation in the liver. Genomically, Cry1 and Cry2
associate with a glucocorticoid response element in the
phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase-1 (PCK1; 614168) promoter in a
hormone-dependent manner, and dexamethasone-induced transcription of the
Pck1 gene was strikingly increased in cryptochrome-deficient livers.
Lamia et al. (2011) concluded that their results revealed a specific
mechanism through which cryptochromes couple the activity of clock and
receptor target genes to complex genomic circuits underpinning normal
metabolic homeostasis.

In mammals, PERIOD (PER1; 602260 and PER2; 603426) and CRYPTOCHROME
(CRY1 and CRY2) proteins accumulate, form a large nuclear complex (PER
complex), and repress their own transcription. Padmanabhan et al. (2012)
found that mouse PER complexes included RNA helicases DDX5 (180630) and
DHX9 (603115), active RNA polymerase II large subunit (180660), Per and
Cry pre-mRNAs, and SETX (608465), a helicase that promotes
transcriptional termination. During circadian negative feedback, RNA
polymerase II accumulated near termination sites on Per and Cry genes
but not on control genes. Recruitment of PER complexes to the elongating
polymerase at Per and Cry termination sites inhibited SETX action,
impeding RNA polymerase II release and thereby repressing
transcriptional reinitiation. Circadian clock negative feedback thus
includes direct control of transcriptional termination.

MAPPING

Kobayashi et al. (1998) mapped the mouse Cry1 and Cry2 genes to
chromosomes 10C and 2E, respectively. Using a GeneBridge 4 radiation
hybrid panel, Ishikawa et al. (1998) mapped the human CRY2 gene to
chromosome 11.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Xing et al. (2013) reported the crystal structures of mammalian CRY2 in
its apo, FAD-bound, and FBXL3 (605653)-SKP1 (601434)-complexed forms.
Distinct from other cryptochromes, mammalian CRY2 binds FAD dynamically
with an open cofactor pocket. Notably, the F-box protein FBXL3 captures
CRY2 by simultaneously occupying its FAD-binding pocket with a conserved
carboxy-terminal tail and burying its PER-binding interface.

ANIMAL MODEL

Van der Horst et al. (1999) disrupted the Cry1 and Cry2 genes in mice.
Homozygous Cry1 -/-, Cry2 -/-, and double-mutant mice had normal 24-hour
circadian rhythms when exposed to 12h/12h light/dark cycles. In total
darkness, Cry1 -/- mice had a faster running clock (22.51 +/- 0.06h, P =
0.00001) than wildtype mice, while Cry2 -/- mice had a slower clock
(24.63 +/- 0.06 hours, P = 0.00001). Double-mutant mice in total
darkness showed a striking instantaneous and complete arrhythmicity,
indicating the absence of an internal circadian clock. The 'clock'
mutant mouse differs in showing a more gradual onset of arrhythmicity.
Mice with only 1 copy of wildtype Cry2 displayed a free-running rhythm
even shorter than that of Cry1 knockouts, which gradually progressed
into arrhythmicity. Once returned to a light/dark cycle, the normal
24-hour period resumed. Mice with only one functional allele of Cry1
showed rhythmic activity with a period intermediate to those of Cry1 -/-
and Cry2 -/- mice. The authors concluded that their results demonstrated
that the Cry proteins are involved in maintaining period length and
circadian rhythmicity, and that a critical balance between Cry1 and Cry2
is required for proper clock functioning.

Thresher et al. (1998) disrupted the mouse Cry2 gene by homologous
recombination. The mutant mice had lowered sensitivity to acute light
induction of the Per1 gene in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), but
exhibited normal circadian oscillations of Per1 and Cry1 mRNA in the
SCN. Behaviorally, the mutants had an intrinsic circadian period about 1
hour longer than normal and exhibited high amplitude phase shifts in
response to light pulses administered at circadian time 17. The authors
considered these data consistent with the hypothesis that Cry2 protein
modulates circadian responses in mice and suggested that cryptochromes
have a role in circadian photoreception in mammals.

Freedman et al. (1999) studied circadian behavior in mice deficient in
both rods and cones. These mice maintained a light-entrained circadian
rhythm, which they lost with enucleation. Lucas et al. (1999) studied
pineal melatonin secretion in mice lacking both rods and cones. There
was normal suppression of pineal melatonin in response to monochromatic
light of wavelength 509 nm. These authors concluded that mammals have
additional ocular photoreceptors which they use in the regulation of
temporal physiology, and suggested CRY1 and CRY2 as candidates.

Okamura et al. (1999) demonstrated that, in mice lacking Cry1 and Cry2,
cyclic expression of the clock genes Per1 and Per2 is abolished in the
suprachiasmatic nucleus and peripheral tissues and that Per1 and Per2
mRNA levels are constitutively high. These findings indicated that the
biologic clock is eliminated in the absence of both Cry1 and Cry2 and
supported the idea that mammalian CRY proteins act in the negative limb
of the circadian feedback loop. The Cry double mutant mice retained the
ability to have Per1 and Per2 expression induced by a brief light
stimulus known to phase-shift the biologic clock in wildtype animals.
Thus, Cry1 and Cry2 are dispensable for light-induced phase shifting of
the biologic clock.

Shearman et al. (2000) demonstrated that in the mouse, the core
mechanism for the master circadian clock consists of interacting
positive and negative transcription and translation feedback loops.
Analysis of Clock/Clock mutant mice, homozygous Per2 mutants, and
Cry-deficient mice revealed substantially altered Bmal1 rhythms,
consistent with a dominant role of Per2 in the positive regulation of
the Bmal1 loop. In vitro analysis of Cry inhibition of
Clock:Bmal1-mediated transcription shows that the inhibition is through
direct protein-protein interactions, independent of the Per and Tim
proteins. Per2 is a positive regulator of the Bmal1 loop, and Cry1 and
Cry2 are the negative regulators of the Period and Cryptochrome cycles.

Yagita et al. (2001) used wildtype and Cry1 -/- and Cry2 -/- deficient
cell lines derived from Cry mutant mice to demonstrate that the
peripheral oscillator in cultured fibroblasts is identical to the
oscillator in the suprachiasmatic nucleus in (1) temporal expression
profiles of all known clock genes; (2) the phase of the various mRNA
rhythms (i.e., antiphase oscillation of Bmal1 (602550) and Per); (3) the
delay between maximum mRNA levels and appearance of nuclear Per1 and
Per2 protein; (4) the inability to produce oscillations in the absence
of functional Cry genes; and (5) the control of period length by Cry
proteins.

Van Gelder et al. (2003) tested pupillary light responses of
cryptochrome mutant mice (Cry1 -/-; Cry2 -/-), outer retinal degenerate
(rd/rd) mice, and mice mutant at all of these loci, as well littermate
controls. There was substantial loss of constriction in the rd/rd mice
compared with control mice. The double mutants for the cryptochromes
showed a pupillary response similar in magnitude to that in control
mice. Almost no pupillary constriction was observed in the triple
knockouts at a 470-nm light intensity. Pupillary responses of the triple
mutants were about 5% as sensitive to blue light as those of the rd/rd
mice. Some pupillary responses were retained in the triple mutant mice
under very bright light, although pupillary movement was somewhat
sluggish. The 50% constriction threshold of pupillary responses was
noted in Cry1 -/-;rd/rd and Cry2 -/-;rd/rd mice, and was comparable to
those of rd/rd mice, indicating that either Cry1 or Cry2 function is
sufficient for retention of pupillary responses in rd/rd animals. Since
all mice were of the same strain background, strain differences were
unlikely to account for the observed differences in pupillary light
responses. Van Gelder et al. (2003) suggested that murine cryptochromes
may function as inner retinal photopigments.

;;NONMETASTATIC PROTEIN 23, HOMOLOG 4; NM23H4;;
METASTASIS INHIBITION FACTOR NM23H4;;
NUCLEOSIDE DIPHOSPHATE KINASE D; NDPKD
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The nucleoside diphosphate (NDP) kinases (EC 2.7.4.6) are ubiquitous
enzymes that catalyze transfer of gamma-phosphates, via a
phosphohistidine intermediate, between nucleoside and dioxynucleoside
tri- and diphosphates. The enzymes are products of the nm23 gene family,
which includes NME4 (Milon et al., 1997).

CLONING

Milon et al. (1997) identified NME4, which they called nm23-H4, by
screening a human stomach cDNA library. The primers were designed from a
pubic database and the cDNA sequences were selected according to their
homology to the human NME1 (156490) putative metastasis suppressor gene.
The full-length cDNA sequence predicts a 187-amino acid protein
possessing the region homologous to NDP kinases with all residues
crucial for nucleotide binding and catalysis, strongly suggesting that
the new gene possesses NDP kinase activity. It shares 56, 55, and 60%
identity with NME1, NME2 (156491), and NME3 (601817), respectively.
Compared with these other proteins, NME4 contains an additional
N-terminal region that is rich in positively charged residues and could
indicate routing to mitochondria. The corresponding 1.2-kb mRNA was
widely distributed and expressed in tissue-dependent manner, being found
at very high levels in prostate, heart, liver, small intestine, and
skeletal muscle tissues, and in low amounts in the brain and in blood
leukocytes.

Masse et al. (2002) cloned mouse Nme4, which they called nm23-M4. The
deduced 186-amino acid protein shares 82% identity with human NME4.
Northern blot analysis of several mouse tissues detected a 1.0-kb
transcript only in heart, kidney, and liver.

GENE FUNCTION

Human NDPKD and ubiquitous MTCK (CKMT1B; 123290) are basic peripheral
membrane proteins with symmetrical homooligomeric structures. Using
lipid dilution assays, Epand et al. (2007) showed that NDPKD and
ubiquitous MTCK facilitated lipid transfer from one bilayer to another.
Lipid transfer occurred between liposomes mimicking the lipid
composition of mitochondrial contact sites, containing 30 mol %
cardiolipin, but transfer did not occur when cardiolipin was replaced by
phosphatidylglycerol. Ubiquitous MTCK, but not NDPKD, showed some
specificity in lipids transferred. Lipid transfer did not involve
vesicle fusion or loss of internal contents of the liposomes.

GENE STRUCTURE

Masse et al. (2002) determined that the mouse and human NME4 genes
contain 5 exons and span about 3.5 kb. Their promoters, like those of
other NME genes, contain several binding sites for AP2 (107580), NF1
(613113), Sp1 (189906), LEF1 (153245), and response elements to
glucocorticoid receptors (138040). There are no TATA or CAAT boxes or
pyrimidine-rich initiator (Inr) sequences.

MAPPING

Milon et al. (1997) mapped the NME4 gene to 16p13.3 by analysis of
human/rodent somatic cell hybrids and by isotopic in situ hybridization.

613249	TITLE *613249 ENDOGENOUS BORNA-LIKE N ELEMENT-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1; EBLN1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Borna disease viruses (BDVs), a genus of nonsegmented negative-sense RNA
viruses, are unique among RNA viruses in that they establish persistent
infection in the cell nucleus. By searching human protein databases for
sequences similar to BDV proteins, Horie et al. (2010) identified a
hypothetical human protein, LOC340900, with significant sequence
similarity to the BDV nucleoprotein gene (BDV-N), which encodes a major
structural protein that tightly encapsidates the viral RNA to form the
nucleocapsid. The 366-residue LOC340900 sequence shares 41% sequence
identity and 58% similarity to the 370-residue BDV-N protein. Sequence
alignment of transcription regulatory elements demonstrated that the S
and T motifs in flanking sequences of the human protein were well
conserved with those of BDV. Homology of LOC340900 to BDV-N was also
confirmed by a permutation test. Because of findings indicating that
LOC340900 may represent an endogenous element related to the BDV-N gene,
Horie et al. (2010) designated the human gene EBLN1. The EBLN1 protein
shares 72% identity with the EBLN2 protein (613250). Horie et al. (2010)
showed that elements homologous to the BDV-N gene exist in the genomes
of several other mammalian species, including nonhuman primates,
rodents, and elephants. Horie et al. (2010) concluded that their results
provided the first evidence for endogenization of nonretroviral
virus-derived elements in mammalian genomes, and further suggested that
the L1 reverse transcriptase is used to promote the endogenization of
EBLN elements, which may still be occurring.

;;NONCODING RNA IN RHABDOMYOSARCOMA; NCRMS;;
NONCODING RNA 54; NCRNA00054
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Rhabdomyosarcoma is a malignant soft tissue tumor in children that
exists in 2 major types, embryonal, or RMS1 (268210), and the clinically
more aggressive alveolar, or RMS2 (268220). Using representational
difference analysis to compare gene expression in RMS1 and RMS2,
followed by RACE and EST database searching, Chan et al. (2002)
identified a gene encoding NCRMS, which was preferentially expressed in
RMS2. Northern blot analysis detected 1.25- and 1.8-kb transcripts in
RMS2 cells and in tissues, with weak expression in most other tumor
types tested. Sequence analysis identified multiple stop codons but no
likely protein-coding reading frames. Chan et al. (2002) concluded that
NCRMS is a noncoding RNA that may be important in myogenesis and in the
development of RMS.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Chan et al. (2002) determined that the
NCRMS gene contains at least 11 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis and radiation hybrid analysis, Chan et al.
(2002) mapped the RMST gene to chromosome 12q21.

;;NEUROKININ 1 RECEPTOR; NK1R;;
SUBSTANCE P RECEPTOR
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Hopkins et al. (1991) isolated functional cDNA clones for human NK1
receptor from human lung RNA using PCR. They then screened a human
cosmid library and isolated a clone that appeared to contain the entire
NK1 receptor gene. A full-length cDNA predicted a peptide of 407 amino
acids, with 89% homology to the rat protein.

Fong et al. (1992) cloned a splice variant of human NK1R that encodes a
311-amino acid protein with a truncated C terminus.

GENE STRUCTURE

Gerard et al. (1991) found that the NK1R gene spans 45 to 60 kb and
comprises 5 exons with introns interrupting at sites homologous to those
in the NK2 receptor gene (162321).

GENE FUNCTION

Gerard et al. (1991) demonstrated that, when transfected into COS-7
cells, the NK1 receptor was selective for substance P; the relative
affinity for neurokinin A (162320) and neurokinin B (162330) was 100-
and 500-fold lower, respectively.

Fong et al. (1992) found that the truncated NK1R isoform expressed in
COS cells bound substance P with an affinity at least 10-fold lower than
that of the full-length form. Furthermore, it elicited an
electrophysiologic response to peptide agonists only weakly in Xenopus
oocytes. Fong et al. (1992) concluded that the full-length and truncated
NK1R isoforms couple to different effector systems.

Using RT-PCR and immunofluorescence microscopy, Lai et al. (2006) found
that undifferentiated THP1 monocyte/macrophage cells expressed the
truncated NK1R isoform, whereas differentiated THP1 cells expressed the
full-length isoform. Exposure of differentiated THP1 cells to substance
P (SP) induced a Ca(2+) increase. In contrast, SP treatment did not
trigger Ca(2+) response in undifferentiated cells, but it did enhance
CCL5 (187011)-mediated Ca(2+) release. Introduction of full-length NK1R
into undifferentiated THP1 cells resulted in Ca(2+) release in response
to SP. Treatment of either cell type with an antagonist of NK1R-SP
binding blocked Ca(2+) release, including that mediated by CCL5.

Neurons in lamina I of the spinal dorsal horn express the NK1 receptor
for substance P and mediate hyperalgesia, an enhanced sensitivity to
painful stimuli. Ikeda et al. (2003) demonstrated that in these but not
in other nociceptive lamina I cells, NK1 receptor-activated signal
transduction pathways and activation of low-threshold (T-type)
voltage-gated calcium channels synergistically facilitate activity- and
calcium-dependent long-term potentiation at synapses from nociceptive
nerve fibers. Thereby, memory traces of painful events are retained.

George et al. (2008) investigated the role of the neurokinin-1 receptor,
a mediator of behavioral stress responses, in alcohol dependence
(103780) and treatment. In preclinical studies, mice genetically
deficient in NK1R showed a marked decrease in voluntary alcohol
consumption and had an increased sensitivity to the sedative effects of
alcohol. In a randomized controlled experimental study, George et al.
(2008) treated recently detoxified alcoholic inpatients with an NK1R
antagonist (n = 25) or placebo (n = 25). The NK1R antagonist suppressed
spontaneous alcohol cravings, improved overall well-being, blunted
cravings induced by a challenge procedure, and attenuated concomitant
cortisol responses. Brain functional magnetic resonance imaging
responses to affective stimuli likewise suggested beneficial NK1R
antagonist effects. George et al. (2008) suggested that given these
surrogate markers of efficacy, NK1R antagonism warrants further
investigation as a treatment in alcoholism.

MAPPING

Hopkins et al. (1991) mapped the NK1R gene to chromosome 2, using PCR to
amplify the human sequence in hamster/human hybrid DNAs and also in
mouse/human monochromosome hybrids.

By analysis of mouse/human hybrid cell DNAs, Gerard et al. (1991) showed
that the NK1R gene is present in single copy and located on human
chromosome 2.

Peyrard-Janvid et al. (2004) linked the TACR1 gene to marker D2S286 on
chromosome 2p11. They excluded it as the cause of a form of dyslexia
mapping to that region (see 604254).

ANIMAL MODEL

De Felipe et al. (1998) disrupted the NK1 receptor gene in mice. Mutant
mice were healthy and fertile, but the characteristic amplification
('wind-up') and intensity coding of nociceptive reflexes were absent.
Although substance P did not mediate the signaling of acute pain or
hyperalgesia, it was essential for the full development of
stress-induced analgesia and for an aggressive response to territorial
challenge. De Felipe et al. (1998) suggested that substance P is
important for orchestrating the response of the animal to major
stressors such as pain, injury, or invasion of territory.

Toxin A, a 308,000-M(r) enterotoxin from Clostridium difficile, mediates
antibiotic-associated diarrhea and colitis in humans. Injection of toxin
A into animal intestine triggers an acute inflammatory response
characterized by activation of sensory neurons and immune cells of the
intestinal lamina propria, including mast cells and macrophages, and
migration of circulating neutrophils in the involved intestinal segment.
Using mice deficient in NK1R, the substance P receptor, as a result of
targeted disruption of the gene in embryonic stem cells, Castagliuolo et
al. (1998) demonstrated protection from the secretory and inflammatory
changes of toxin A as well as from epithelial cell damage. The
protective effect correlated with diminished intestinal levels of
TNF-alpha (191160) and its mRNA and the leukocyte enzyme myeloperoxidase
(606989). The results demonstrated a major requirement for substance P
receptors in the pathogenesis of acute inflammatory diarrhea.

Modulation of substance P activity offers a radical new approach to the
management of depression, anxiety, and stress. The substance P receptor
is highly expressed in areas of the brain that are implicated in these
behaviors, but also in other areas, such as the nucleus accumbens, that
mediate the motivational properties of both natural rewards such as food
and of drugs of abuse such as opiates. Murtra et al. (2000) demonstrated
a loss of the rewarding properties of morphine in mice with a genetic
disruption of the substance P receptor, generated by De Felipe et al.
(1998). The loss was specific to morphine, as both groups of mice
responded when cocaine or food was used as a reward. The physical
response to opiate withdrawal was also reduced in substance P receptor
knockout mice. Murtra et al. (2000) concluded that substance P has an
important and specific role in mediating the motivational aspects of
opiates and may represent a pharmacologic route for the control of drug
abuse.

Murine gamma-herpesvirus-68 (gHV-68) shares sequence homology and
pathologic similarities with human Epstein-Barr virus and herpesvirus-8.
Elsawa et al. (2003) observed increased expression of substance P and
its receptor, Tacr1, in mucosal and lymphoid organs of wildtype mice
after intragastric inoculation with gHV-68. Tacr1-deficient mice showed
an increased viral burden and a reduced cytotoxic lymphocyte response
against gHV-68, as well as lower expression of Il12 mRNA and protein
during infection. Elsawa et al. (2003) concluded that elimination of
Tacr1 increases susceptibility to gHV-68.

Using immunohistochemistry, Svensson et al. (2005) detected increased
levels of substance P (SP; 162320) in vaginal tissue early after
infection of female mice with genital herpes simplex virus (HSV)-2. A
modest, but statistically significant, inhibitory effect of SP on HSV-2
infection was observed in vitro. Mice lacking the SP receptor, Nk1r,
showed enhanced viral replication, including in the central nervous
system, and reduced viral clearance associated with HSV-2 dose-dependent
accumulation of Mip1a (CCL3; 182283) and impaired local natural killer
cell function. Vaccination of Nk1r -/- and wildtype mice with an
attenuated HSV-2 strain showed that SP signaling was not required for
protection against HSV-2 challenge, and HSV-2-specific T cells secreting
Ifng (147570) were present in both Nk1r -/- and wildtype mice. Svensson
et al. (2005) concluded that HSV-2 infection induces SP expression in
vagina and that NK1R signaling contributes to innate resistance to
infection.

611853	TITLE *611853 MITOCHONDRIAL RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN L48; MRPL48
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Mitochondria have their own translation system for production of 13
inner membrane proteins essential for oxidative phosphorylation. MRPL48
is a component of the large subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome that
is encoded by the nuclear genome (Koc et al., 2001).

CLONING

By searching databases using bovine Mrpl48 as query, Koc et al. (2001)
identified human MRPL48. They also identified MRPL48 homologs in mouse,
Drosophila, and C. elegans, but not in yeast, E. coli, or Arabidopsis.
Mouse and human MRPL48 share 81% amino acid identity.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Zhang and Gerstein (2003) mapped the
MRPL48 gene to chromosome 11q13.2. They identified an MRPL48 pseudogene
on chromosome 6.

611321	TITLE *611321 CALSYNTENIN 1; CLSTN1
;;ALCADEIN, ALPHA;;
ALC-ALPHA;;
KIAA0911
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) cloned CLSTN1, which they designated
KIAA0911. The deduced protein contains 981 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA
detected moderate expression in adult kidney and ovary, in adult and
fetal brain, and in all specific brain regions examined. Weaker
expression was detected in heart, lung, and spleen, and little to no
expression wad detected in skeletal muscle, pancreas, and adult and
fetal liver.

Hintsch et al. (2002) reported that the 981-amino acid CLSTN1 protein
contains an N-terminal signal sequence, followed by 2 cadherin (see
192090) repeats, a C-terminal transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic C
terminus. It shares 92% amino acid identity with mouse Clstn1. Northern
blot analysis detected high expression of a 5-kb transcript in brain,
with much lower expression in heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, and
placenta. In situ hybridization of adult mouse brain revealed that more
than 90% of neurons expressed Clstn1.

Araki et al. (2007) stated that the cytoplasmic domain of CLSTN1
contains 2 tryptophan- and aspartic acid (WD)-rich sequences separated
by an asparagine-proline (NP) motif and an acidic region.

GENE FUNCTION

Vogt et al. (2001) found that a proteolytically cleaved N-terminal
Clstn1 fragment localized in the postsynaptic membrane of both
excitatory and inhibitory synapses in chicken and rodents. Proteolytic
cleavage of Clstn1 in its extracellular region generated a transmembrane
stump that was internalized and accumulated in the spine apparatus of
spine synapses. The cytoplasmic domain of mouse Clstn1 bound Ca(2+),
suggesting that CLSTN1 may modulate Ca(2+)-mediated postsynaptic
signaling and that this modulation may be regulated by extracellular
proteolysis.

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis and protein pull-down assays, Konecna et
al. (2006) showed that mouse Clstn1 interacted directly with kinesin
light chain-1 (KLC1; 600025). Mutation analysis revealed that the
cytoplasmic domain of Clstn1 bound the tetratricopeptide repeats of
Klc1. Immunoelectron microscopy located Clstn1 in association with
tubulovesicular organelles in mouse axonal fiber tracts. In primary
neuronal cultures, Calstn1-containing organelles were aligned along
microtubules and partially colocalized with kinesin-1. These
Clstn1-containing organelles were transported along axons with a
velocity and processivity typical for fast axonal transport. Point
mutations in the 2 kinesin-binding segments of Clstn1 significantly
reduced binding to Klc1 in vitro, and vesicles bearing mutated Clstn1
exhibited markedly altered anterograde axonal transport.

By yeast 2-hybrid and coimmunoprecipitation analyses, Araki et al.
(2007) showed that mouse and human ALC-alpha interacted with KLC1. The
interaction required the C-terminal WD-containing sequence of ALC-alpha.
Using cultured mouse neurons, Araki et al. (2007) found that Alc-alpha
induced kinesin-1 association with vesicles and functioned as a novel
cargo in axonal anterograde transport. Transport of Alc-alpha-containing
vesicles competed with that of amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP;
104760)-containing vesicles for kinesin-1, and disruption of transport
of APP-containing vesicles increased amyloid-beta generation.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Hintsch et al. (2002) mapped the CLSTN1
gene to chromosome 1p36. They mapped the mouse Clstn1 gene to chromosome
4.

148070	TITLE *148070 KERATIN 18; KRT18
;;K18;;
CYTOKERATIN 18; CYK18
DESCRIPTION Intermediate filaments (IFs) are a structurally related family of
cellular proteins that appear to be intimately involved with the
cytoskeleton. The common structural motif shared by all IFs is a central
alpha-helical 'rod domain' flanked by variable N- and C-terminal
domains. The rod domain, the canonical feature of IFs, has been highly
conserved during evolution. The variable terminals, however, have
allowed the known IFs to be classified into 6 distinct types by virtue
of their differing amino acid sequences (Steinert and Roop, 1988).
Keratins compose types I and II; intermediate filaments desmin,
vimentin, GFAP, and peripherin, type III; neurofilaments, type IV, and
nuclear lamins, type V. Nestin (600915) has been classed as type VI
(Lendahl et al., 1990). The acidic keratins are coded by genes KRT9
(607606) to KRT19 (148020). These genes are located on mouse chromosome
11 and human chromosome 17, except for KRT18 which may be located on
human chromosome 12 (see later). The basic keratins are coded by genes
KRT1 (139350) to KRT8 (148060), which are located on mouse chromosome 15
and human chromosome 12.

Human keratin 18 and the homologous mouse Endo B are type I IF protein
subunits whose expression is restricted in adults to a variety of simple
epithelial tissues. Endo B and its coexpressed type II keratin, Endo A
(the mouse equivalent of human keratin 8), appear to be the first IF
proteins expressed during murine development. Type I and type II
keratins are usually expressed as preferential pairs in equal
proportions in cells, although filaments can be formed in vitro from
heterologous IF subunits. KRT18 is the most divergent of the type I
keratins with N-terminal and C-terminal domains that are quite different
from those of epidermal keratins. According to Kulesh and Oshima (1989),
the genes that code for 12 diverse IF proteins had been cloned and
characterized. Kulesh and Oshima (1989) isolated the human KRT18 gene as
a 10-kb fragment of genomic DNA. Following transfection, the gene was
expressed in several different mouse cell lines including nonepithelial
cells that do not express the homologous endogenous Endo-B gene. The
KRT18 gene is 3,791 bp long and the keratin 18 protein is coded for by 7
exons. The exon structure of KRT18 has been conserved compared to that
of other keratin genes, with the exception of a single 3-prime terminal
exon that codes for the tail domain of the protein that is represented
by 2 exons in epidermal keratins. Waseem et al. (1990) used
human-specific primers from within introns of the published gene
sequence for human type I keratin 18 and PCR to amplify this gene
specifically. By Southern blotting using the genomic DNA PCR product,
they assigned the gene for keratin 18 to chromosome 12. Other human type
I keratins have been assigned to chromosome 17. Waseem et al. (1990)
suggested that the findings indicate the early divergence of the genes
for stratifying cell keratins from that of simple, or embryonic, keratin
18.

By in situ hybridization, Heath et al. (1990) localized a human
cytokeratin 18 cDNA sequence to 17p12-p11. They presented the findings
as evidence for a clustering of cytokeratin genes and related sequences
on the p and q arms of chromosome 17. The findings are, however,
inconsistent with those of Waseem et al. (1990).

By analysis of a YAC contig from 12q13, Yoon et al. (1994) demonstrated
that the KRT18 type I keratin gene is located next to its type II
partner, KRT8, in a cluster of type II keratin genes.

Ku et al. (1995) described transgenic mice that express point-mutant K18
and develop chronic hepatitis and hepatocyte fragility in association
with disruption of hepatocyte keratin filaments. They showed that
transgenic mice expressing mutant K18 are highly susceptible to
hepatotoxicity after acute administration of acetaminophen or chronic
ingestion of griseofulvin. The authors concluded that the predisposition
to hepatotoxicity results directly from the keratin mutation since
nontransgenic or transgenic mice that express normal human K18 are more
resistant. Hepatotoxicity was manifested by a significant difference in
lethality, liver histopathology, and biochemical serum testing. Keratin
glycosylation decreased in all griseofulvin-fed mice, whereas keratin
phosphorylation increased dramatically preferentially in mice expressing
normal K18. The phosphorylation increase in normal K18 after
griseofulvin feeding appeared to involve sites that are different from
those that increased after partial hepatectomy. Ku et al. (1996) stated
that this dramatic phosphorylation increase in nonmutant keratins could
provide survival advantage to hepatocytes. Although the potential for
K18 mutations to cause human disease remain to be investigated, they
considered it possible that K8/18 mutations may not directly cause
disease but may predispose to it; for example, mutations may confer
susceptibility to liver disease upon exposure to an environmental factor
such as a virus or hepatotoxin.

Although mutations had been described in 11 of the more than 20 keratin
intermediate filaments (as the basis of epidermal and oral disorders),
no disease-associated mutations had been described in keratin 8 (KRT8;
148060) or KRT18 until the report by Ku et al. (1997). K8/18 is the
major keratin pair in epithelia of the type found in liver, pancreas,
and intestine. Transgenic mice that express mutant keratin 18, as
already noted, develop chronic hepatitis, and have an increased
susceptibility to drug-induced hepatotoxicity. By studying patients with
liver disease of unknown cause for mutations in KRT18, Ku et al. (1997)
described a his127leu (H127L) KRT mutation in a patient with cryptogenic
cirrhosis (see 215600) that was germline transmitted (148070.0001). The
mutant KRT18 isolated from the liver explant, or after expression in
bacteria, showed an altered migration on 2-dimensional gel analysis as
compared with normal human liver or bacterially expressed KRT18.
Electron microscopy of in vitro assembled mutant KRT18 and wildtype KRT8
showed an assembly defect as compared with normal KRT8/18 assembly. The
results suggested that mutations in KRT18 predispose to cryptogenic
cirrhosis in humans.

KRT18, HIS127LEU

Among 120 patients with cirrhosis of undetermined cause (see 215600), Ku
et al. (1997) found 1 patient with a heterozygous A-to-T transversion in
the KRT18 gene that resulted in a his127-to-leu substitution. The
mutation was germline since sequencing of amplified genomic DNA,
isolated from a blood sample of the daughter of the patient, showed the
same H127L mutation in heterozygous form.

Ku et al. (2003) found a his127-to-leu mutation in noncryptogenic
cirrhosis and concluded that the mutation functions as a susceptibility
gene.

610284	TITLE *610284 LIPOYLTRANSFERASE 1; LIPT1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

In mammals, lipoyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.181) catalyzes the second of 2
steps in the covalent attachment of lipoic acid to lipoate-dependent
proteins, including the glycine cleavage system H protein (GCSH; 238330)
and the dihydrolipoamide acyltransferase (E2) subunits of the pyruvate
dehydrogenase complex (DLAT; 608770), the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase
complex (DLST; 126063), and the branched-chain 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase
complex (DBT; 248610) (Fujiwara et al., 1999).

CLONING

Using a bovine lipoyltransferase cDNA fragment as probe, Fujiwara et al.
(1999) cloned human LIPT1 from a liver cDNA library. The deduced
373-amino acid precursor protein shares 88% and 31% sequence identity
with bovine lipoyltransferase II and E. coli lipoate-protein ligase A,
respectively. By alignment of LIPT1 with the bovine lipoyltransferase
amino acid sequence, Fujiwara et al. (1999) predicted that the
N-terminal 26 amino acids comprise a mitochondrial targeting sequence,
with the threonine-27 corresponding to the first residue of the mature
enzyme. Thus, the deduced mature LIPT1 enzyme contains 347 amino acids
with a calculated molecular mass of 39.539 kD. Northern blot analysis
detected a major 1.5-kb transcript in all tissues examined, with highest
expression in skeletal muscle and heart, followed by liver, brain,
placenta, and lung.

GENE STRUCTURE

Fujiwara et al. (1999) determined that the LIPT1 gene contains 4 exons
and spans 8 kb of genomic DNA. They found evidence of several LIPT1
transcripts resulting from alternative splicing in the 5-prime
untranslated region.

MAPPING

By FISH, Fujiwara et al. (1999) mapped the LIPT1 gene to chromosome
2q11.2.

606343	TITLE *606343 POLYMERASE, DNA, LAMBDA; POLL
DESCRIPTION DNA polymerases can participate in both replication of the genome and
DNA repair processes. The human genome contains multiple DNA polymerase
genes.

CLONING

By searching sequence databases to identify new members of the polX
family, Aoufouchi et al. (2000) identified EST clones representing 2 DNA
polymerases, POLM (606344) and POLL, which they called pol mu and pol
lambda, respectively. By screening bone marrow and lymph node cDNA
libraries, they isolated a full-length POLL cDNA. POLL encodes a deduced
575-amino acid protein predicted to contain a polX domain, a BRCA-1
C-terminal (BRCT) domain, and 2 helix-hairpin-helix (HHH) DNA-binding
motifs. POLL structurally resembles terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase
(TDT; 187410). It shares 34% amino acid identity with DNA polymerase
beta (POLB; 174760) and 82% identity with mouse Poll. Aoufouchi et al.
(2000) found that POLL has template-dependent DNA polymerase activity in
vitro. Northern blot analysis detected a 2.7-kb POLL transcript with
highest expression in testis and fetal liver and very weak expression in
many other tissues. They identified POLL splice variants which they
considered to be nonfunctional. Using semiquantitative RT-PCR
amplification, Aoufouchi et al. (2000) concluded that POLL mRNA
expression is downregulated in a dose- and time-dependent manner upon
cell exposure to DNA damaging agents.

Aoufouchi et al. (2000) provided a phylogenetic comparison of yeast and
human proteins of the polX family.

GENE STRUCTURE

Aoufouchi et al. (2000) determined that POLL is encoded by 8 exons and
spans approximately 9 kb of genomic DNA.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the POLL
gene to human chromosome 10 (TMAP sts-W69567).

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database analysis, followed by screening of EST databases, and
5-prime and 3-prime RACE, Silva et al. (2003) identified RGSL1. The
deduced 500-amino acid protein contains a 120-amino acid regulator of G
protein signaling (RGS) domain and shares 84.2% similarity with the
mouse homolog. RT-PCR of human tissues detected high expression in
testis with lower expression in bone marrow and prostate.

GENE STRUCTURE

Silva et al. (2003) determined that the RGSL1 gene contains 15 exons
spanning 67.1 kb.

;;FBX24
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the F-box protein family, such as FBXO24, are characterized
by an approximately 40-amino acid F-box motif. SCF complexes, formed by
SKP1 (601434), cullin (see CUL1; 603134), and F-box proteins, act as
protein-ubiquitin ligases. F-box proteins interact with SKP1 through the
F box, and they interact with ubiquitination targets through other
protein interaction domains (Jin et al., 2004).

CLONING

Jin et al. (2004) reported that the FBXO24 protein contains a central F
box and a C-terminal RCC1 (179710) fold.

MAPPING

Jin et al. (2004) stated that the FBXO24 gene maps to chromosome 7q22
and the mouse Fbxo24 gene maps to chromosome 5G2.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Nitric oxide (NO) accounts for the biologic activity of
endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF), discovered by Furchgott and
Zawadzki (1980) and Rapoport and Murad (1983). NO is synthesized in
endothelial cells from L-arginine by nitric oxide synthase (NOS). EDRF
is important in regulation of vasomotor tone and blood flow by
inhibiting smooth muscle contraction and platelet aggregation. Janssens
et al. (1992) isolated a cDNA encoding a human vascular NOS. The
translated human protein was 1,203 amino acids long with a predicted
molecular mass of 133 kD. They showed that the cDNA encodes a
calcium-regulated, constitutively expressed endothelial NOS, capable of
producing EDRF in blood vessels. Marsden et al. (1992) likewise cloned
and sequenced human endothelial NO synthase. Their cDNA clones predicted
a protein of 1,203 amino acids with about 60% identity with the rat
brain NO synthase isoform (163731). (Nitric oxide synthases have been
assigned to 2 classes: a constitutively expressed, calcium-regulated
class identified in brain, neutrophils, and endothelial cells, and a
calcium-independent class identified in endotoxin- or cytokine-induced
macrophages and endothelial cells (163730).)

GENE STRUCTURE

Marsden et al. (1993) isolated genomic clones encoding human endothelial
NO synthase and determined the structural organization of the gene. It
contains 26 exons spanning approximately 21 kb of genomic DNA and
encodes an mRNA of 4,052 nucleotides. Characterization of the
5-prime-flanking region indicated that the NOS3 gene is TATA-less and
exhibits proximal promoter elements consistent with a constitutively
expressed gene, namely, SP1 and GATA motifs.

MAPPING

By Southern blot hybridization of human/rodent somatic cell hybrids,
Marsden et al. (1993) assigned the NOS3 gene to chromosome 7 and
regionalized it to 7q35-q36 by fluorescence in situ hybridization. By
PCR amplification applied to a panel of DNAs from human/rodent somatic
cell hybrids, by Southern blot analysis, and by fluorescence in situ
hybridization, Robinson et al. (1994) localized the NOS3 gene to 7q36.
By analysis of interspecific backcross progeny, Gregg et al. (1995)
mapped the mouse homolog to chromosome 5.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Raman et al. (1998) reported the crystal structure of the heme domain of
endothelial NOS in tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4)-free and -bound forms at
1.95-angstrom and 1.9-angstrom resolution, respectively. In both
structures a zinc ion is tetrahedrally coordinated to pairs of
symmetry-related cysteine residues at the dimer interface. The conserved
Cys-(X)4-Cys motif and its strategic location establish a structural
role for the metal center in maintaining the integrity of the
BH4-binding site. The unexpected recognition of the substrate L-arginine
at the BH4 site indicates that this site is poised to stabilize a
positively charged pterin ring and suggests a model involving a cationic
pterin radical in the catalytic cycle.

GENE FUNCTION

Fulton et al. (1999) demonstrated that AKT (164730) directly
phosphorylated eNOS and activated the enzyme leading to nitric oxide
production, whereas eNOS mutated at a putative AKT phosphorylation site
was resistant to phosphorylation and activation by AKT. Activated AKT
increased basal nitric oxide release from endothelial cells, and
activation-deficient AKT attenuated NO production stimulated by VEGF
(192290). Thus, Fulton et al. (1999) concluded the eNOS is an AKT
substrate linking signal transduction by AKT to the release of the
gaseous second messenger nitric oxide.

Dimmeler et al. (1999) stated that physiologically, the most important
stimulus for the continuous formation of nitric oxide is the viscous
drag (or shear stress) generated by the streaming blood on the
endothelial layer. PI3K (see 601232) and AKT are activated in
endothelial cells in response to shear stress. Dimmeler et al. (1999)
demonstrated that AKT mediates the activation of eNOS, leading to
increased nitric oxide production. Inhibition of the PI3K AKT pathway or
mutation of the AKT site on eNOS protein at serine-1177 attenuated the
serine phosphorylation and prevented the activation of eNOS. Mimicking
the phosphorylation of ser1177 directly enhanced enzyme activity and
altered the sensitivity of the enzyme to calcium, rendering its activity
maximal at subphysiologic concentrations of calcium. Thus,
phosphorylation of eNOS by AKT represented a novel calcium-independent
regulatory mechanism for activation of eNOS.

Napolitano et al. (2000) investigated the interactions between ET1
(131240) and the NO system in the feto-placental unit. They examined the
mRNA expression of ET1, inducible NOS (163730), and eNOS in human
cultured placental trophoblastic cells obtained from preeclamptic (PE)
and normotensive pregnancies. ET1 expression was increased in PE cells,
whereas iNOS, which represents the main source of NO synthesis, was
decreased; conversely, eNOS expression was increased. ET1 was able to
influence its own expression as well as NOS isoform expression in normal
and PE trophoblastic cultured cells. The findings suggested the
existence of a functional relationship between ET(s) and NOS isoforms
that could constitute the biologic mechanism leading to the reduced
placental blood flow and increased resistance to flow in the
feto-maternal circulation that are characteristic of the pathophysiology
of preeclampsia.

Autosomal dominant adult polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD; 173900) is
associated with altered endothelial-dependent vasodilation and decreased
vascular production of NO. Thus, eNOS could have a modifier effect in
ADPKD. To test this hypothesis, Persu et al. (2002) genotyped 173
unrelated European ADPKD patients for the glu298-to-asp (163729.0001),
intron 4 VNTR, and -786T-C (163729.0002) polymorphisms of ENOS and
looked for their influence on the age at end-stage renal disease (ESRD).
In 93 males, the glu298-to-asp polymorphism was associated with a lower
age at ESRD. This effect was confirmed in a subset of males linked to
PKD1 (601313) and reaching ESRD before age 45, and by a cumulative renal
survival analysis in PKD1-linked families. Further studies demonstrated
that NOS activity was decreased in renal artery samples from PKD males
harboring the asp298 allele, in association with posttranslational
modifications and partial cleavage of eNOS. No significant effect of the
other polymorphisms was found in males, and no polymorphism influenced
the age at ESRD in females. Persu et al. (2002) concluded that
glu298-to-asp is associated with a 5 year lower mean age at ESRD in a
subset of ADPKD males. They hypothesized that the effect could be due to
decreased NOS activity and a partial cleavage of eNOS, leading to a
further decrease in the vascular production of NO.

Nisoli et al. (2003) found that NO triggers mitochondrial biogenesis in
cells as diverse as brown adipocytes and 3T3-L1, U937, and HeLa cells.
This effect of NO was dependent on cGMP and was mediated by the
induction of PPARGC1 (604517), a master regulator of mitochondrial
biogenesis. Moreover, Nisoli et al. (2003) found that mitochondrial
biogenesis induced by exposure to cold was markedly reduced in brown
adipose tissue of eNOS -/- mice, which had a reduced metabolic rate and
accelerated weight gain compared to wildtype mice. Thus, Nisoli et al.
(2003) concluded that a NO-cGMP-dependent pathway controls mitochondrial
biogenesis and body energy balance.

Simoncini et al. (2004) demonstrated that tibolone and its estrogenic
metabolites activate NO synthesis by recruiting functional estrogen
receptors, whereas the progestogenic/androgenic metabolite had no
effect. During prolonged exposures, tibolone and the estrogenic
compounds enhanced the expression of eNOS. In addition, tibolone was
able to induce rapid activation of eNOS, leading to rapid increases in
the release of NO. Different from estrogen, rapid activation of eNOS did
not rely on recruitment of PI3K but rather on MAPK-dependent cascades.

Robb et al. (2004) found that the 5-prime UTR of the NOS3AS (612205)
transcript was complementary to the portion of NOS3 mRNA derived from
exons 23 to 26. RT-PCR analysis showed that expression of NOS3 in human
umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and human aortic vascular
smooth muscle cells (HAOVSMCs) was inversely proportional to that of
NOS3AS. Both the NOS3 and NOS3AS genes were transcriptionally active;
however, NOS3AS appeared to downregulate the steady-state levels of NOS3
mRNA and protein. RT-PCR showed that overexpression of the overlapping
region of NOS3AS had little impact on NOS3 mRNA levels in HUVECs;
however, Western blot analysis showed that NOS3 protein levels were
markedly reduced. NOS3AS also reduced the expression of a chimeric
transcript containing the NOS3-overlapping sequence fused to a reporter
gene. Inhibition of NOS3AS expression by RNA interference (RNAi) in
HAOVSMCs increased NOS3 expression, and inhibition of histone
deacetylase (see HDAC1; 601241) in HAOVSMCs increased expression of
NOS3AS mRNA prior to decrease in NOS3 mRNA expression. Robb et al.
(2004) concluded that NOS3AS participates in the posttranscriptional
regulation of NOS3.

Fish et al. (2007) found that NOS3AS was induced by hypoxia in cultured
human endothelial and smooth muscle cells and in aortas of hypoxic rats.
NOS3AS induction preceded the decrease in NOS3 steady-state mRNA in
endothelial cells, and knockdown of NOS3AS by RNAi indicated that NOS3AS
downregulated NOS3 expression during hypoxia. Hypoxia did not induce
transcription of NOS3AS, but instead stabilized NOS3AS transcripts,
predominantly the short NOS3AS variant, leading to elevated NOS3AS
levels. RT-PCR of fractionated cells showed that both NOS3AS pre-mRNA
and mature NOS3AS mRNA were enriched in the nucleus under basal
conditions. Under hypoxic conditions, the cytoplasmic levels of mature
NOS3AS mRNA increased more than 30-fold, whereas levels in the nucleus
increased only moderately. In contrast, the nuclear/cytoplasmic
distribution of NOS3 mRNA was not altered under hypoxic conditions, with
NOS3 mRNA levels decreasing in both the cytoplasm and nucleus. NOS3
associated with polyribosomes in normoxic cells, but its association
with polyribosomes was attenuated in hypoxic cells, concurrent with
association of the short NOS3AS variant with polyribosomes. Fish et al.
(2007) concluded that NOS3 expression is regulated by its overlapping
NOS3AS transcript in a hypoxia-dependent fashion.

Nisoli et al. (2005) reported that calorie restriction for either 3 or
12 months induced eNOS expression and 3-prime/5-prime-cyclic GMP in
various tissues of male mice. This was accompanied by mitochondrial
biogenesis, with increased oxygen consumption and ATP production, and an
enhanced expression of Sirt1 (604479). Nisoli et al. (2005) reported
these effects were strongly attenuated in eNOS null-mutant mice. Thus,
Nisoli et al. (2005) concluded that nitric oxide plays a fundamental
role in the processes induced by calorie restriction and may be involved
in the extension of life span in mammals.

Using human platelets, Ji et al. (2007) demonstrated that polymerization
of beta-actin (ACTB; 102630) regulated the activation state of NOS3, and
hence NO formation, by altering its binding to heat-shock protein-90
(HSP90, or HSPCA; 140571). NOS3 bound the globular, but not the
filamentous, form of beta-actin, and the affinity of NOS3 for globular
beta-actin was, in turn, increased by HSP90. Formation of this ternary
complex of NOS3, globular beta-actin, and HSP90 increased NOS activity
and cyclic GMP, an index of bioactive NO, and increased the rate of
HSP90 degradation, thus limiting NOS3 activation. Ji et al. (2007)
concluded that beta-actin regulates NO formation and signaling in
platelets.

Lim et al. (2008) demonstrated that blocking phosphorylation of the AKT
substrate eNOS inhibits tumor initiation and maintenance. Moreover, eNOS
enhances the nitrosylation and activation of endogenous wildtype Ras
proteins (see 190020), which are required throughout tumorigenesis. Lim
et al. (2008) suggested that activation of the PI3K-AKT-eNOS-(wildtype)
Ras pathway by oncogenic Ras in cancer cells is required to initiate and
maintain tumor growth.

Chen et al. (2010) showed that S-glutathionylation of eNOS reversibly
decreases NOS activity with an increase in superoxide generation
primarily from the reductase, in which 2 highly conserved cysteine
residues are identified as sites of S-glutathionylation and found to be
critical for redox-regulation of eNOS function. Chen et al. (2010)
showed that e-NOS S-glutathionylation in endothelial cells, with loss of
nitric oxide and gain of superoxide generation, is associated with
impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation. In hypertensive vessels,
eNOS S-glutathionylation is increased with impaired
endothelium-dependent vasodilation that is restored by thiol-specific
reducing agents, which reverse this S-glutathionylation. Chen et al.
(2010) concluded that S-glutathionylation of eNOS is a pivotal switch
providing redox regulation of cellular signaling, endothelial function,
and vascular tone.

Straub et al. (2012) reported a model for the regulation of NO signaling
by demonstrating that hemoglobin alpha, encoded by the HBA1 (141800) and
HBA2 (141850) genes, is expressed in human and mouse arterial
endothelial cells and enriched at the myoendothelial junction, where it
regulates the effects of NO on vascular reactivity. Notably, this
function is unique to hemoglobin alpha and is abrogated by its genetic
depletion. Mechanistically, endothelial hemoglobin alpha heme iron in
the Fe(3+) state permits NO signaling, and this signaling is shut off
when hemoglobin alpha is reduced to the Fe(2+) state by endothelial
CYB5R3 (613213). Genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of CYB5R3
increases NO bioactivity in small arteries. Straub et al. (2012)
concluded that their data revealed a mechanism by which the regulation
of the intracellular hemoglobin alpha oxidation state controls NOS
signaling in nonerythroid cells. The authors suggested that this model
may be relevant to heme-containing globins in a broad range of
NOS-containing somatic cells.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a Japanese study of 100 patients with essential hypertension (145500)
and 123 patients with normal blood pressure, Nakayama et al. (1997)
found that the distribution of allele frequencies for the CA repeat in
the NOS3 gene was not significantly different between the 2 groups.
However, comparing the allele frequencies in the hypertensive group
without left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and the normotensive group,
the overall distributions were significantly different (p = 0.019). The
33-repeat allele was found more frequently in the hypertensive group
without LVH than in the normotensive group.

Bonnardeaux et al. (1995) found that the highly polymorphic (CA)n
repeats in intron 13 and 2 biallelic markers in intron 18 of the NOS3
gene are not associated with essential hypertension. Wang et al. (1996)
studied a marker closer to the 5-prime end of the NOS3 gene, the 27-bp
repeat in intron 4, in relation to coronary artery disease. They
identified 2 alleles: a common larger allele (allele frequency, 0.830)
and a smaller rare allele (0.170). The larger allele had 5 tandem 27-bp
repeats. The smaller allele had only 4 repeats that were apparently
missing the third repeat judging by minor a difference in sequence. The
distribution of the genotypes appeared to be in Hardy-Weinberg
equilibrium and the polymorphism was inherited in a simple mendelian
fashion. Wang et al. (1996) found from study of 549 subjects with and
153 without coronary artery disease that in current and ex-cigarette
smokers, but not nonsmokers, there was a significant excess of
homozygotes for the rare allele in patients with severely stenosed
arteries, compared with those with no mild stenosis. This genotype was
also associated with a history of myocardial infarction. The authors
noted that, since endothelial-dependent vasodilatation is mediated by
release of nitric oxide formed by constitutively expressed endothelial
nitric oxide synthase, the smoking-dependent excess coronary risk in
homozygotes is consistent with a predisposition to endothelial
dysfunction.

Coronary spasm plays an important role in the pathogenesis not only of
variant angina but also of ischemic heart disease in general. However,
the prevalence of coronary spasm appears to be higher in Japanese than
in Caucasians (Bertrand et al., 1982; Yasue and Kugiyama, 1990),
suggesting that genetic factors may be involved in its pathogenesis.
Endothelial-derived nitric oxide has been implicated in the control of
vascular tone. Kugiyama et al. (1997) and Motoyama et al. (1997) showed
that basal acetylcholine-stimulated and flow-dependent nitric oxide
activities are decreased in both coronary and brachial arteries of
patients with coronary spasm. Yoshimura et al. (1998) identified a
glu298-to-asp variant (E298D; 163729.0001) in exon 7 of the NOS3 gene
that was more frequent in patients with coronary spasm. In studies of an
elderly population in Australia, Liyou et al. (1998) could find no
association of the E298D variant with coronary artery disease.

Nakayama et al. (1999) reported that a -786T-C mutation (163729.0002) in
the promoter region of the eNOS gene reduced transcription of the gene
and was strongly associated with coronary spastic angina and myocardial
infarction. To elucidate the molecular mechanism for the reduced eNOS
gene transcription, Miyamoto et al. (2000) purified a protein that
specifically binds to the mutant allele in nuclear extracts from HeLa
cells. The purified protein was identical to replication protein A1
(RPA1; 179835), known as a single-stranded DNA-binding protein essential
for DNA repair, replication, and recombination. In human umbilical vein
endothelial cells, inhibition of RPA1 expression using antisense
oligonucleotides restored transcription driven by the mutated promoter
sequence, whereas overexpression of RPA1 further reduced it. Serum
nitrite/nitrate levels among individuals carrying the -786T-C mutation
were significantly lower than among those without the mutation. The
authors concluded that RPA1 apparently functions as a repressor protein
in the -786T-C mutation-related reduction of eNOS gene transcription
associated with the development of coronary artery disease.

Pregnancy-induced hypertension (see 189800) may be regarded as a
manifestation of endothelial cell dysfunction. Constitutive nitric oxide
production in endothelial cells increases during pregnancy and
contributes to vasodilatation and blunting of vasopressor response. In
women developing pregnancy-induced hypertension, NO generation is
inappropriately low, and administration of an NO donor improves flow in
the uterine artery in normal early pregnancy and in women at high risk
of developing disease. Yallampalli and Garfield (1993) and others had
observed that inhibition of NO synthesis in rats during pregnancy
produces hypertension, proteinuria, thrombocytopenia, and fetal growth
retardation. These considerations prompted Arngrimsson et al. (1997) to
study linkage to the NOS3 gene in affected sisters and in multiplex
families. A lod score of 3.36 was obtained for D7S505 when a
best-fitting model derived from genetic epidemiologic data was used, and
lod scores of 2.54 to 4.03 were obtained when various other genetic
models were used. The transmission/disequilibrium test (TDT), a
model-free estimate of linkage, showed strongest association and linkage
with a microsatellite within intron 13 of the NOS3 gene (P = 0.005).

Lewis et al. (1999) were unable to detect linkage of preeclampsia to the
NOS3 region on 7q. They studied 2, separately ascertained, affected
sister-pairs collections, from Amsterdam and Cambridge (U.K.), that
contained 104 sibships. In the Cambridge Centre, a total of 21 extended
pedigrees suitable for conventional parametric linkage studies were also
identified. The reason for the discrepancy with the results of
Arngrimsson et al. (1997) was not clear. Lewis et al. (1999) concluded
that although abnormalities in NO production have been observed in
preeclampsia, the case for the NOS3 gene or its product, eNOS, having a
primary role in the pathophysiology of preeclampsia remained unproved.

Tempfer et al. (2001) performed a prospective case-control study of 105
women with idiopathic recurrent miscarriage and 91 healthy controls.
Using PCR, they identified the different alleles of a 27-basepair tandem
repeat polymorphism in intron 4 of the NOS3 gene. The wildtype allele
was identified in 329 of 392 chromosomes (frequency 0.84). The
polymorphic A allele was present on 63 chromosomes (frequency 0.16). The
genotype frequencies were as follows: 68% (B/B), 31% (A/B), and 0.5%
(A/A). The distribution of genotype frequencies was significantly
different between the study and in control groups for allele A/B
heterozygotes (36.7 vs 23.8%, P = 0.03, odds ratio 1.6, 95% CI 1.1-3.8).
Only 1 person in the study group was A/A.

Tanus-Santos et al. (2001) studied the distribution of genetic variants
of 3 clinically relevant NOS3 polymorphisms in 305 ethnically
well-characterized DNA samples (100 Caucasians, 100 African Americans,
and 105 Asians). They found marked interethnic differences in the
distribution of NOS3 variants, in the estimated haplotype frequency, and
in the association between variants. The asp298 variant (163729.0001)
was more common in Caucasians (34.5%) than in African Americans (15.5%)
or Asians (8.6%) (p less than 0.0001). The -786C variant (163729.0002)
was also more common in Caucasians (42.0%) than in African Americans
(17.5%) or Asians (13.8%) (p less than 0.0001). The 4a VNTR in intron 4
was more common in African Americans (26.5%) than in Caucasians (16.0%)
or Asians (12.9%) (p less than 0.0001). The most common predicted
haplotype in the 3 groups combined only wildtype variants. Asians had
the highest frequency of this haplotype (77% in Asians vs 46% in the
other groups). In Caucasians, the asp298 and -786C variants were
associated, and this haplotype was predicted to have a frequency of 24%.

Endothelial nitric oxide synthase plays a key role in the regulation of
normal function of the vessel wall. Heltianu et al. (2002) found a
relatively high frequency of 2 polymorphic variants of NOS3 in males
with Fabry disease (301500) and suggested that in addition to mutations
in the alpha-galactosidase A gene, variation in NOS3 may be significant
in determining the phenotype.

Casas et al. (2004) performed a metaanalysis of 26 case-control studies
evaluating the association between the NOS3 polymorphisms E298D,
-786T-C, and the intron 4 VNTR and ischemic heart disease (myocardial
infarction or angiographic coronary artery occlusion), involving 9,867
cases and 13,161 controls. They found that homozygosity for asp298 or
the intron 4 A allele was associated with an increased risk of ischemic
heart disease (OR, 1.31 and 1.34, respectively), but no significant
association was found with the -786C allele. Casas et al. (2004)
suggested that common genetic variations in the NOS3 gene contribute to
atherosclerosis susceptibility.

In 110 dizygotic white twin pairs, Persu et al. (2005) identified NOS3
haplotypes based on 3 polymorphisms, E298D, the intron 4 VNTR, and
-786T-C, and the intron 13 CA repeat. Haplotype analysis revealed a
significant association between NOS3 haplotypes and daytime ambulatory
diastolic and systolic blood pressure, with the latter remaining
significant after adjustment for multiple testing (p = 0.032) and mainly
attributable to 4 haplotypes accounting for 11.9% of all represented
haplotypes.

The therapeutic application of NO in high-altitude (HA) disorders, for
the improvement of oxygenation and vasodilation, prompted Ahsan et al.
(2005) to investigate the NOS3 gene with respect to high-altitude
adaptation. They screened 131 HA monks, 136 HA controls, and 170
lowlanders for the NOS3 894G-T (E298D; 163729.0001) polymorphism and for
the 4B/4A polymorphisms. NO levels were estimated and correlated with
the polymorphisms. The 3 groups were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for
the polymorphisms. Wildtype alleles G and 4B were significantly
overrepresented in the HA groups as compared with the lowlanders (p =
0.006 and p = 0.02, respectively). NO levels were highest in HA monks,
followed by HA controls, and then lowlanders (p less than 0.0001).
Combinations of the GG and BB genotypes were distributed significantly
more frequently in the HA monks (p less than 0.0001) and HA controls (p
= 0.0005) than in lowlanders. Ahsan et al. (2005) concluded that the
genotype combination of NOS3 wildtype homozygotes (GG, BB) occurs more
frequently in high-altitude groups that in lowlanders and contributes to
higher NO levels associated with high-altitude adaptation.

ANIMAL MODEL

Pharmacologic blockade of NO production with arginine analogs such as
L-nitroarginine or L-N-arginine methylester affects multiple isoforms of
nitric oxide synthase and so cannot distinguish their physiologic roles.
To study the role of endothelial NOS in vascular function, Huang et al.
(1995) disrupted the gene encoding endothelial NOS in mice by homologous
recombination. Homozygous mutant mice were found to be viable, fertile,
and indistinguishable from wildtype and heterozygous littermates in
appearance or routine behavior. Immunoreactive NOS3 protein was not
present, as shown by Western blot analysis of the brain, heart, lung,
and aorta. Endothelium-derived relaxing factor activity, as assayed by
acetylcholine-induced relaxation, was absent, and the NOS3 mutant mice
were hypertensive. Thus, the author concluded that NOS3 mediates basal
vasodilation. Responses to NOS blockade in the mutant mice suggested
that nonendothelial isoforms of NOS may be involved in maintaining blood
pressure. Huang et al. (1995) suggested that perhaps the
renin-angiotensin system and autonomic nervous system evolved to serve
primarily as a defense against hypotension, and diminution in their
activity is a poor buffer against hypertension. Alternatively, NOS3 may
be involved in establishing the baroreceptor set-point. The question of
whether subpopulations of humans suffering from hypertension have
defects in NOS3 expression awaits an answer from genetic analysis and
the development of more selective inhibitors of the NOS isoforms.

Snyder (1995) reviewed the significance of the findings of Huang et al.
(1995) in the NOS3 'knockout' mouse because so-called nNOS (NOS1;
163731) occurs in nerves that mediate penile erection and NOS inhibitors
block erection. It was thought that the null mutant nNOS mice would not
procreate. As it turned out, however, these animals do breed and appear
to be generally normal. However, they have dilated stomachs with a
constricted pyloric sphincter, and so provide a model for infantile
hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. The same mice are resistant to brain
damage caused by vascular strokes, confirming that nitric oxide is
crucial in mediating stroke damage. Further studies indicated that the
nNOS-negative mice are highly aggressive toward other males to the
extent that they will kill their wildtype littermates if left
unattended, and they display strikingly inappropriate and excessive
sexual behavior. Mice homozygous for a knockout in NOS2 (macrophage or
inducible NOS, iNOS) have markedly reduced defenses against
microorganisms such as Listeria and Leishmania and against the
proliferation of lymphoma tumor cells.

Champion et al. (1999) cited work indicating that NOS activity decreases
with age. To determine whether adenoviral-mediated overexpression of
NOS3 could enhance erectile responses, they administered a recombinant
adenovirus containing the NOS3 gene into the corpora cavernosum of the
aged rat. Adenoviral expression of the beta-galactosidase reporter gene
was observed in cavernosal tissue one day after the intracavernosal
administration of the beta-gal-marked adenovirus; one day after
administration of the construct containing NOS3, transgene expression
was confirmed by immunoblot staining of NOS3 protein, and cGMP levels
were increased. The increase in cavernosal pressure in response to
cavernosal nerve stimulation was enhanced in animals transfected with
NOS3, and erectile responses to acetylcholine and zaprinast were
enhanced. Champion et al. (1999) suggested that in vivo gene transfer of
NOS3, alone or in combination with a type V phosphodiesterase inhibitor,
may constitute a new therapeutic intervention for the treatment of
erectile dysfunction.

Steudel et al. (1998) investigated the effects of congenital deficiency
of NOS3 on the pulmonary vascular responses to hypoxia. The findings
suggested that congenital NOS3 deficiency in mice enhances hypoxic
pulmonary vascular remodeling and hypertension, and right ventricular
hypertrophy, and that NO production by NOS3 is vital to counterbalance
pulmonary vasoconstriction caused by chronic hypoxic stress.

To study the role of nitric oxide constitutively produced by NOS3 in the
regulation of blood pressure and vascular tone, Ohashi et al. (1998)
generated transgenic mice overexpressing bovine NOS3 in the vascular
wall using murine preproendothelin-1 (ET1) promoter. Blood pressure was
significantly lower in NOS3-overexpressing mice than in control
littermates. In the transgenic aorta, basal NO release and basal cGMP
levels were significantly increased. In contrast, relaxations of
transgenic aorta in response to acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside
were significantly attenuated, and the reduced vascular reactivity was
associated with reduced response of cGMP elevation to these agents as
compared with control aortas. Thus, in addition to the essential role of
NOS3 in blood pressure regulation, tonic NO release by NOS3 in the
endothelium induces the reduced vascular reactivity to NO-mediated
vasodilatators, providing several insights into the pathogenesis of
nitrate tolerance.

In the heart, nitric oxide inhibits L-type calcium channels but
stimulates sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release, leading to variable
effects on myocardial contractility. Barouch et al. (2002) demonstrated
that spatial confinement of specific nitric oxide synthase isoforms
regulates this process. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS3)
localizes to caveolae, where compartmentalization with beta-adrenergic
receptors and L-type calcium channels allows nitric oxide to inhibit
beta-adrenergic-induced inotropy. Neuronal nitric oxide synthase (NOS1;
163731), however, is targeted to cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum. NO
stimulation of sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release via the ryanodine
receptor (RYR2; 180902) in vitro, suggests that NOS1 has an opposite
facilitative effect on contractility. Barouch et al. (2002) demonstrated
that Nos1-deficient mice have suppressed inotropic response, whereas
Nos3-deficient mice have enhanced contractility, owing to corresponding
changes in sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release. Both Nos1 -/- and
Nos3 -/- mice developed age-related hypertrophy, although only Nos3 -/-
mice were hypertensive. Nos1/3 -/- double knockout mice had suppressed
beta-adrenergic responses and an additive phenotype of marked
ventricular remodeling. Thus, NOS1 and NOS3 mediate independent, and in
some cases opposite, effects on cardiac structure and function.

Aicher et al. (2003) demonstrated that the impaired neovascularization
in mice lacking eNOS is related to a defect in progenitor cell
mobilization. Mice deficient in eNOS showed reduced vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF; 192240)-induced mobilization of endothelial
progenitor cells and increased mortality after myelosuppression.
Intravenous infusion of wildtype progenitor cells, but not bone marrow
transplantation, rescued the defective neovascularization of
Nos3-deficient mice in a model of hind-limb ischemia, suggesting that
progenitor mobilization from the bone marrow is impaired in Nos3-null
mice. Mechanistically, MMP9 (120361), required for stem cell
mobilization, was reduced in the bone marrow of Nos3-null mice. Aicher
et al. (2003) concluded that eNOS expressed by bone marrow stromal cells
influences recruitment of stem and progenitor cells. The authors
suggested that this may contribute to impaired regeneration processes in
ischemic heart disease patients, who are characterized by a reduced
systemic nitric oxide bioactivity.

Caveolin-3 (CAV3; 601253), a strong inhibitor of all NOS isoforms, is
expressed in sarcolemmal caveolae microdomains and binds to NOS3 in
cardiac myocytes and NOS1 in skeletal myocytes. Ohsawa et al. (2004)
characterized the biochemical and cardiac parameters of P104L
(601253.0001)-mutant Cav3 transgenic mice, a model of an autosomal
dominant limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD1C; 607801). Transgenic
mouse hearts demonstrated hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, enhanced basal
contractility, decreased left ventricular end diastolic diameter, and
loss and cytoplasmic mislocalization of Cav3 protein. Cardiac muscle
showed activation of NOS3 catalytic activity without increased
expression of all NOS isoforms. Ohsawa et al. (2004) suggested that a
moderate increase in NOS3 activity associated with loss of Cav3 may
result in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

Bivalacqua et al. (2004) studied the contribution of RhoA (AHRA;
165390)/Rho kinase (ROCK1; 601702) signaling to erectile dysfunction in
streptozotocin (STZ) diabetic rats. Rho kinase and eNOS colocalized in
the endothelium of corpus cavernosum, and RhoA and Rho kinase abundance
and Mypt1 (602021) phosphorylation were elevated in STZ diabetic rat
penis. In addition, eNOS protein expression, cavernosal constitutive NOS
activity, and cGMP levels were reduced in STZ diabetic rat penis.
Bivalacqua et al. (2004) introduced a dominant-negative RhoA mutant and
found that erectile responses in the STZ diabetic rats improved to
values similar to controls.

Longo et al. (2005) crossbred Nos3-null and wildtype mice to generate 2
types of heterozygous litters, one with a maternally derived mutation
that developed in a Nos3-deficient environment and the other with a
paternally derived mutation that developed in a uterine environment
similar to wildtype mice. In studies of the in vitro reactivity of
carotid and mesenteric artery segments of adult mice to vasoactive
agents, the maternally derived heterozygous mice had abnormal vascular
reactivity that was similar to that of homozygous knockout mice
completely lacking functional NOS3, whereas the paternally derived
heterozygous mice had normal vascular reactivity that was not different
from that of wildtype mice. Longo et al. (2005) stated that this was the
first direct evidence in support of a role for uterine environment in
determining vascular function in later life.

In a mouse model of sepsis, Connelly et al. (2005) observed a temporal
reduction in iNOS expression and activity in lipopolysaccharide-treated
Nos3-knockout mice as compared with wildtype mice, which was reflected
in a more stable hemodynamic profile in Nos3-null mice during
endotoxemia. In human umbilical vein cells, lipopolysaccharide led to
the activation of Nos3 through phosphoinositide 3-kinase (see 171833)-
and Akt/protein kinase B (164730)-dependent enzyme phosphorylation.
Connelly et al. (2005) concluded that NOS3 has a proinflammatory role in
the pathogenesis of sepsis, in which following initial NOS3 activation
the resultant NO acts as a costimulus for the expression of iNOS.

Liu et al. (2005) presented evidence suggesting a role for G
protein-coupled receptor kinase-2 (GRK2; 109635) in the regulation of NO
production and hepatic vascular dynamics in a rat model of liver
sinusoidal endothelial injury and portal hypertension induced by bile
duct ligation. Sinusoidal endothelial cells isolated from the affected
animals had increased levels of GRK2, reduced levels of phosphorylated
AKT and eNOS, and decreased levels of NO. Gene silencing of GRK2 using
siRNA in injured sinusoidal endothelial cells restored AKT activity and
resulted in increased NO production. Liu et al. (2005) also found that
heterozygous Grk2 mice had increased levels of phosphorylated Akt and
decreased portal hypertension in response to injury compared to wildtype
mice. Liu et al. (2005) proposed a mechanism in which upregulation of
GRK2 after endothelial cell injury directly inhibits phosphorylation of
AKT, leading to reduced activation of eNOS and decreased production of
NO, and resulting in portal hypertension.

NOS3, GLU298ASP

Yoshimura et al. (1998) found a glu298-to-asp (E298D) variant (dbSNP
rs1799983) in exon 7 of the NOS3 gene. In a study of 113 patients with
coronary spasm, in whom the diagnosis of coronary spasm was made by
intracoronary injection of acetylcholine, and 100 control subjects, they
found a significant difference in the distribution of the variant; 21.2%
of the coronary spasm group and 9.0% of the control group (p = 0.014 for
dominant effect) showed the variant. In an elderly population in
Australia, Liyou et al. (1998) could demonstrate no difference in the
distribution of the E298D alleles in relation to the presence of
coronary artery disease.

Cai et al. (1999) genotyped 763 white Australians undergoing coronary
angiography for the eNOS glu298-to-asp mutation resulting from an 894G-T
transition. The frequencies of the GG, TG, and TT genotypes were not
significantly different in men or women with or without coronary artery
disease. The mutation was also not associated with myocardial infarction
(MI) in males or females, or with the number of significantly stenosed
vessels. The T allele frequency (32.5%) was much greater than that
reported for the Japanese population (7.8% in controls and 10% in MI
patients). Hingorani et al. (1999) investigated the relationship between
the glu298-to-asp variant in atherosclerotic coronary artery disease,
using 2 independent case-controlled studies. In the first study, cases
consisted of 298 unrelated patients with positive coronary angiograms
and controls were 138 unrelated healthy individuals ascertained through
a population health screen. In the second study, the cases were 249
patients with recent MI and a further 183 unrelated controls. There was
an excess of homozygotes for the asp298 variant among patients with
angiographic coronary artery disease, and among patients with recent MI
when compared with their respective controls (35.9% vs 10.2% in the
first study, and 18.1% vs 8.7% in the second study). In comparison to
glu298 homozygotes, homozygosity for asp298 was associated with an odds
ratio of 4.2 (95% confidence interval, 2.3 to 7.9) for angiographic
coronary artery disease and 2.5 (95% confidence interval, 1.3 to 4.2)
for MI.

Dahiyat et al. (1999) found a significant association of late-onset
Alzheimer disease (AD; 104300) and homozygosity for the glu allele in a
study of 122 early-onset and 317 late-onset Alzheimer cases compared to
392 controls. This was independent of apoE status. The authors remarked
on the interaction of beta-amyloid with endothelial cells. In contrast,
Higuchi et al. (2000) studied 411 Japanese patients with sporadic AD and
2 groups of controls: 350 Japanese controls and 52 Caucasian controls.
They found no difference in the glu298-to-asp polymorphism between AD
patients and controls, even when stratifying for age of onset and
presence of the APOE E4 allele. However, they observed that the glu
allele frequency was significantly higher in Japanese controls than in
Caucasian controls, suggesting that the association reported by Dahiyat
et al. (1999) may be a function of race. Akomolafe et al. (2006) found
that the glu298 allele was significantly associated with AD in a group
of over 200 African American patients, but not among a similar number of
Caucasians. A metaanalysis of 12 previously published similar studies
showed a small effect of the glu/glu genotype on AD risk across all
studies (OR of 1.15), but also showed significant heterogeneity.
Akomolafe et al. (2006) noted that the GG genotype (corresponding to
glu/glu) is prevalent in the general population (0.33 to 0.87),
suggesting that by itself the polymorphism plays only a modest role in
the development of AD and likely interacts with other factors.

In a study of 35 patients with histories of placental abruption and 170
control subjects, Yoshimura et al. (2001) found that the frequency of
glu298-to-asp homozygotes and heterozygotes was higher in the placental
abruption group than in the control group (40% vs 14%; p less than
0.001).

Kobashi et al. (2001) found in a study in Japan that the frequency of
heterozygotes and homozygotes for asp298 in the NOS3 gene was
significantly higher in patients with hypertension in pregnancy (0.23)
(see 189800) than in controls (0.12) (p less than 0.01). Multivariate
analysis showed that a family history of hypertension, the TT genotype
of the angiotensinogen gene (AGT; 106150.0001), the GA+AA NOS3 genotype,
and a prepregnancy body mass index of more than 24 were independent
potent risk factors, after adjustment for maternal age and parity. The
odds ratios of these factors were 2.7, 2.3, 2.2, and 2.1, respectively.
The results suggested that the asp298 of NOS3 is a potent, independent
risk factor for hypertension in pregnancy.

In a study of 150 'coloured' South African patients, 50 with normal
pregnancies, 50 with severe preeclampsia, and 50 with abruptio
placentae, Hillermann et al. (2005) found that the combined frequency of
the GT and TT NOS3 variant genotypes was significantly higher in the
abruptio placentae group than in the control group (p = 0.006). Among
preeclamptic patients who subsequently developed abruptio placentae, the
T allele emerged as a major risk factor for the development of abruptio
placentae (p less than 0.0001); the T variant did not seem to affect the
risk of preeclampsia itself, however.

Jachymova et al. (2001) found a significantly higher frequency of T
alleles (related to the E298D polymorphism) in hypertensives (see
145500) as compared to normotensives. Significant association was found
in patients showing resistance to conventional antihypertensive therapy.
In well-controlled hypertensives the tendency to a higher frequency of T
alleles was observed, but this did not reach statistical significance.
The presence of the T allele was thought to be predictive of the
patients' therapeutic response.

In a metaanalysis of 14 case-control studies evaluating the association
between E298D and ischemic heart disease (myocardial infarction or
angiographic coronary artery occlusion) involving 6,036 cases and 6,106
controls, Casas et al. (2004) found that homozygosity for asp298 was
associated with an increased risk of ischemic heart disease (OR, 1.31).

Berger et al. (2007) performed 2 large case-control studies involving
1,901 hospitalized stroke patients and 1,747 regional population
controls and found that E298D was significantly associated with ischemic
stroke (601367) independent of age, gender, hypertension, diabetes, and
hypercholesterolemia.

CORONARY ARTERY SPASM 1, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
NOS3, -786T-C

Nakayama et al. (1999) searched for possible mutations in the
endothelial nitric oxide synthase gene in patients with coronary spasm.
They found evidence of 3 linked mutations in the 5-prime flanking region
of the eNOS gene, among them a -786T-C transition. The incidence of
these alleles was significantly greater in 174 patients with coronary
artery spasm studied than in 161 controls. Multiple logistic regression
analysis with forward stepwise selection using the environmental risk
factors and the eNOS gene variant revealed that the most predictive
independent risk factor for coronary spasm was the mutant allele. As
assessed by luciferase reporter gene assays, the -786T-C mutation
resulted in a significant reduction of eNOS gene promoter activity,
whereas neither of the other mutations had any effect.

116820	TITLE *116820 CATHEPSIN H; CTSH
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a probe deduced from the amino acid sequence of mature human
cathepsin H, Fuchs et al. (1988) obtained a cathepsin H clone from a
kidney cDNA library. The cDNA encodes a mature 220-amino acid protein
plus 28 amino acids of the propeptide. The protein has 2 potential sites
for N-glycosylation, one in the prosequence and another in the mature
sequence. Proteolytic processing of the propeptide and cleavage between
asn177 and gly178 produces the mature enzyme with both heavy and light
chains. Northern blot analysis detected a 1.7-kb cathepsin H transcript
in kidney and inflamed tonsil, but not in placenta or liver.

Fuchs and Gassen (1989) cloned human preprocathepsin H, a lysosomal
cysteine proteinase. The prepro sequence consists of 115 amino acids.

MAPPING

Using previously identified cathepsin cDNAs as hybridization probes,
Wang et al. (1987) mapped CTSH to chromosome 15q24-q25. They noted that
a form of Batten disease (see 204200), representing perhaps about
one-fourth of all cases, has been found to show deficiency of cathepsin
H.

Deussing et al. (1997) mapped Ctsh to mouse chromosome 9 by linkage
analysis. A related sequence was identified on the X chromosome, which
may represent a pseudogene or a gene of a closely related cysteine
proteinase.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

For discussion of a possible association of mutation in the CTSH gene
with myopia, facial dysmorphism, and hearing loss, see 116820.0001.

ANIMAL MODEL

Aldahmesh et al. (2013) examined eyes from Ctsh -/- mice and observed a
markedly abnormal posterior chamber with a configuration suggestive of
increased axial lengthening, compared to the rounded appearance in
wildtype littermates.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
VARIANT OF UNKNOWN SIGNIFICANCE
CTSH, 4-BP DEL, 485CTGT

This variant is classified as a variant of unknown significance because
its contribution to myopia, facial dysmorphism, and hearing loss has not
been confirmed.

In a 1-year-old boy from a consanguineous Saudi Arabian family with
extreme myopia, facial dysmorphism, and hearing loss, Aldahmesh et al.
(2013) identified homozygosity for a 4-bp deletion (c.485_488delCTGT;
Alkuraya, 2013) in the CTSH gene, causing a frameshift predicted to
result in a premature termination codon (Leu162ProfsTer66). The mutation
was present in heterozygosity in his unaffected parents and brother, and
was not found in 210 Saudi exome files or in the SNP databases of the
1000 Genomes Project and the Exome Variant Server. RT-PCR showed a 90%
reduction in mutant transcription compared to controls, presumably due
to nonsense-mediated decay. Alkuraya (2013) noted that the patient's
other eye was phthisical subsequent to retinal detachment caused by the
very large globe; the patient also exhibited dysmorphic features,
including hypertelorism, large forehead, and low-set, posteriorly
rotated ears, and had hearing loss.

611123	TITLE *611123 EPHRIN RECEPTOR EphA10; EPHA10
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Ephrin receptors, the largest subfamily of receptor tyrosine kinases
(RTKs), and their ephrin ligands are important mediators of cell-cell
communication regulating cell attachment, shape, and mobility in
neuronal and epithelial cells (Aasheim et al., 2005). See 179610 for
additional background on Eph receptors and ephrins.

CLONING

By database analysis, Robinson et al. (2000) identified EPHA10. By
further database analysis and PCR of a testis cDNA library, Aasheim et
al. (2005) cloned EPHA10 and identified 3 isoforms. A 295-amino acid
soluble secreted Eph receptor (EphA10s) contains the Eph receptor
ligand-binding domain but lacks fibronectin III repeats. Full-length
EphA10 is composed of 1008 predicted amino acids, the first 283 of which
are identical to EphA10s, and its sequence predicts the canonic Eph
receptor structure containing an Eph ligand-binding domain, 2
fibronectin III repeats, an intracellular conserved kinase domain, and a
SAM domain. The third isoform, EphA10*, lacks the SAM domain. EPHA10
shares 91% amino acid identity with its mouse ortholog. Northern blot
analysis of human tissues detected expression in testis only. Binding
studies with EphA10s showed strong binding to EFNA3 (601381), EFNA4
(601380) and EFNA5 (601535), but weak binding to EFNB1 (300035) and
EFNB2 (600527).

GENE STRUCTURE

Aasheim et al. (2005) determined that the EPHA10 gene contains 17 exons.
Alternative splicing of exons 3 and 15 results in a soluble isoform
EphA10s, which contains only the first 3 exons, and an isoform lacking
the SAM domain, which they called EphA10*.

MAPPING

Aasheim et al. (2005) noted that the EPHA10 gene maps to chromosome
1p34.3.

608933	TITLE *608933 ENDONUCLEASE VIII-LIKE 2; NEIL2
;;NEI2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

NEIL2 belongs to a class of DNA glycosylases homologous to the bacterial
Fpg/Nei family. These glycosylases initiate the first step in base
excision repair by cleaving bases damaged by reactive oxygen species and
introducing a DNA strand break via the associated lyase reaction
(Bandaru et al., 2002)

CLONING

By searching a database for sequences similar to the Arabidopsis DNA
glycosylase Fpg, Bandaru et al. (2002) identified NEIL2. Bacterial
Fpg/Nei proteins contain 2 structural domains: an N-terminal 2-layered
beta sandwich and a C-terminal 4-helix bundle, which includes a
helix-2-turns-helix (H2TH) motif and a zinc finger. The deduced
332-amino acid human NEIL2 protein has conserved residues in 6 highly
conserved regions that span both structural domains of the bacterial
Fpg/Nei proteins, but it has an unusual CHCC zinc finger.

Using Northern blot analysis, Hazra et al. (2002) detected a 2.4-kb
NEIL2 transcript. Expression was highest in skeletal muscle and testis,
moderate in brain and heart, and low in all other tissues examined.
Analysis of NEIL2 expression in synchronized human diploid fibroblasts
indicated that, unlike expression of NEIL1 (608844), expression of NEIL2
is independent of the cell cycle. Epitope-tagged NEIL2 was expressed in
nuclei of transfected cells, although a small fraction was also observed
in the cytoplasm. The deduced NEIL2 protein has a calculated molecular
mass of 36.7 kD, but bacterially-expressed NEIL2 showed an apparent
molecular mass of 42 kD by SDS-PAGE.

GENE FUNCTION

Hazra et al. (2002) characterized recombinant NEIL2 following expression
in E. coli. The enzyme showed DNA glycosylase/abasic lyase activity,
primarily for excising oxidative products of cytosine, with highest
activity for 5-hydroxyuracil. NEIL2 showed lower activity for
5,6-dihydrouracil and 5-hydroxycytosine, and negligible or undetectable
activity with 8-oxoguanine, thymine glycol, 2-hydroxyadenine,
hypoxanthine, and xanthine. Hazra et al. (2002) concluded that NEIL2 is
involved in global genome repair, mainly for removing oxidative products
of cytosine.

Dou et al. (2003) found that both NEIL2 and NEIL1 bound 5-hydroxyuracil
contained within bubble DNA, contrasting strongly with NTH1 (602656) and
OGG1 (601982), which did not produce stable complexes with either
single-strand DNA or a DNA bubble. NEIL2 had much higher activity for
excising 5-hydroxyuracil in bubble DNA than with duplex or single-strand
DNA. NEIL2 could also excise 8-oxoguanine when it was placed inside a
bubble.

GENE STRUCTURE

Bandaru et al. (2002) determined that the NEIL2 gene contains 4 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Bandaru et al. (2002) mapped the NEIL2
gene to chromosome 8p23.1.

180231	TITLE *180231 RETINOIC ACID-BINDING PROTEIN, CELLULAR, TYPE II; CRABP2
DESCRIPTION CRABP2 is highly expressed in human skin. Giguere et al. (1990) isolated
a cDNA encoding mouse Crabp-2 by a low stringency cloning strategy using
a probe from previously cloned CRABP1 cDNA (180230). MacGregor et al.
(1992) determined the genomic organization of the murine Crabp-2 gene
and performed a detailed analysis of its transcriptional unit. It was
shown to be approximately 4.6 kb long and divided into 4 exons in a
structure common to other members of the family of serum and cellular
retinoid-binding proteins. The chromosomal location of the Crabp-2 locus
was determined by interspecific backcross analysis using progeny derived
from matings of C57BL/6J and M. spretus. Mapping results indicated that
the gene is located on mouse chromosome 2 linked to muscle nicotinic
acetylcholine receptor alpha-chain (Acra) and catalase-1 (Cas-1).
MacGregor et al. (1992) suggested that the human homolog is located on
2q or 11p. Elder et al. (1992) localized the CRABP2 gene to 1q21 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization. Localization was confirmed by
hybridization of a CRABP2 cDNA clone against a human/mouse hybrid cell
line containing a t(1;6)(q21;q13) translocation chromosome.

Flagiello et al. (1997) mapped CRABP2 to 1q21.3 by fluorescence in situ
hybridization.

606538	TITLE *606538 MYOSIN IC; MYO1C
;;MYOSIN 2, RAT, HOMOLOG OF; MYR2;;
NUCLEAR MYOSIN I; NMI
DESCRIPTION Myosins are molecular motors that, upon interaction with actin
filaments, utilize energy from ATP hydrolysis to generate mechanical
force. For further background information on myosins, see MYO1A
(601478).

CLONING

By screening a kidney cDNA library with a mouse Myo1c probe, Crozet et
al. (1997) obtained a human cDNA encoding MYO1C. The deduced 1,028-amino
acid protein, which is 96% identical to the mouse protein, contains ATP-
and actin-binding sequences in the motor (or head) domain, followed by
three 23-residue IQ motifs and a tail domain rich in basic residues that
is expected to interact with negatively charged membrane phospholipids.
Northern blot analysis revealed ubiquitous expression of Myo1c in adult
mouse tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

MYO1C, also known as myosin I-beta and MYR2, was thought to mediate the
slow component of adaptation by hair cells, the sensory cells of the
inner ear. To test this hypothesis, Holt et al. (2002) mutated tyr61 of
MYO1C to gly, conferring susceptibility to inhibition by N6-modified ADP
analogs. They expressed the mutant MYO1C in utricular hair cells of
transgenic mice, delivered an ADP analog through a whole-cell recording
pipette, and found that the analog rapidly blocked adaptation to
positive and negative deflections in transgenic cells but not in
wildtype cells. The speed and specificity of inhibition suggested that
MYO1C participates in adaptation in hair cells.

Bose et al. (2002) reported that the unconventional myosin MYO1C is
present in GLUT4 (138190)-containing vesicles purified from 3T3-L1
adipocytes. MYO1C is highly expressed in primary and cultured
adipocytes. Insulin (176730) enhances the localization of MYO1C with
GLUT4 in cortical tubulovesicular structures associated with actin
filaments, and this colocalization is insensitive to wortmannin.
Insulin-stimulated translocation of GLUT4 to the adipocyte plasma
membrane is augmented by the expression of wildtype MYO1C and inhibited
by a dominant-negative cargo domain of MYO1C. A decrease in the
expression of endogenous MYO1C mediated by small interfering RNAs
inhibited insulin-stimulated uptake of 2-deoxyglucose. Thus, Bose et al.
(2002) concluded that MYO1C functions in a
phosphatidylinositol-3-hydroxykinase (PI3K; see 601232)-independent
insulin signaling pathway that controls the movement of intracellular
GLUT4-containing vesicles to the plasma membrane.

MAPPING

Using PCR and radiation hybrid analysis, Crozet et al. (1997) mapped the
MYO1C gene to 17p13.

HISTORY

A report by Nunez et al. (2008) indicating that 3-dimensional
motor-dependent interchromosomal interactions involving MYO1C are

target genes was retracted.

611575	TITLE *611575 STERILE ALPHA MOTIF DOMAIN-CONTAINING 8; SAMD8
;;SPHINGOMYELIN SYNTHASE-RELATED; SMSR
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching databases for sequences encoding motifs characteristic of
SM synthases (see 611573), Huitema et al. (2004) identified SAMD8, which
they called SMSR. The deduced 415-amino acid protein contains 5
membrane-spanning alpha helices connected by hydrophilic extramembrane
loops. SMSR also contains 4 highly conserved motifs, designated D1 to
D4.

MAPPING

Hartz (2007) mapped the SAMD8 gene to chromosome 10q22.2 based on an
alignment of the SAMD8 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK057811) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.1).

111730	TITLE *111730 BETA-1,4-N-ACETYL-GALACTOSAMINYLTRANSFERASE 2; B4GALNT2
;;GALGT2;;
CT-GalNAc TRANSFERASE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

B4GALNT2 catalyzes the last step in the biosynthesis of the human Sd(a)
antigen, which is found on more than 90% of Caucasian red blood cells,
through the addition of an N-acetylgalactosamine residue via a beta-1,4
linkage to a subterminal galactose residue substituted with an
alpha-2,3-linked sialic acid. B4GALNT2 also catalyzes the last step in
the biosynthesis of the Cad antigen, which is related both serologically
and biochemically to the Sd(a) antigen (summary by Montiel et al.,
2003).

CLONING

CT1 and CT2 are monoclonal antibodies that recognize an oligosaccharide
structure that is identical, at least in part, to Sd(a). Using
expression cloning to identify a mouse cDNA that synthesized an epitope
recognized by CT2, Smith and Lowe (1994) cloned B4galnt2, which they
designated CT-GalNAc transferase. The deduced 510-amino acid protein has
a calculated molecular mass of 58.3 kD. It has characteristics of a type
II transmembrane glycosyltransferase, with a short N-terminal tail,
followed by a transmembrane domain and a 478-amino acid C-terminal
catalytic domain predicted to face the Golgi lumen. The mouse CT-GalNAc
transferase cDNA shares 51% nucleotide identity with the human cDNA
encoding GM2/GD2 synthase (B4GALNT1; 601873), with highest identity in
the region encoding the catalytic domain.

Dohi et al. (1996) obtained a partial human B4GALNT2 sequence by RT-PCR
of gastric mucosa RNA using primers based on mouse CT-GalNAcT. The human
cDNA fragment shared 86% nucleotide identity with mouse CT-GalNAc
transferase and 63% identity with human GM2/GD2 GalNAc transferase.
Northern blot analysis detected a 2-kb B4GALNT2 transcript in normal
gastric mucosa. RT-PCR detected expression in normal human stomach,
jejunum, and ileum, with a proximal-to-distal gradient of expression in
colon.

By searching databases for sequence similar to mouse B4galnt2, followed
by RT-PCR and 5-prime RACE of a human colon carcinoma cell line, Montiel
et al. (2003) cloned 2 variants of B4GALNT2. The longer transcript
encodes a deduced 566-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular
mass of 63.3 kD. It contains an N-terminal cytosolic domain, followed by
a transmembrane domain and a long catalytic domain. The shorter
transcript encodes a deduced 506-amino acid protein with calculated
molecular mass of 57.0 kD. It has a different N-terminal cytosolic
domain than the full-length form. Northern blot analysis detected
B4GALNT2 transcripts of 8.8, 6.1, 4.7, 3.8, and 1.65 kb. Highest
expression was in colon, with lower expression in kidney, stomach,
ileum, and rectum. RNA dot blot analysis showed basal and low expression
of B4GALNT2 in all normal tissues examined, and RT-PCR detected
expression in several cancer cell lines.

GENE STRUCTURE

Montiel et al. (2003) determined that the B4GALNT2 gene contains at
least 12 exons, including 2 alternatively spliced first exons, and spans
more than 36 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Montiel et al. (2003) mapped the B4GALNT2
gene to chromosome 17q23.1. The mouse gene maps to chromosome 11 in a
region that shows homology of synteny to human chromosome 17 (Mohlke et
al., 1999).

GENE FUNCTION

By biochemical analysis, Smith and Lowe (1994) confirmed that mouse
CT-GalNAc transferase synthesized the epitope recognized by human
anti-Sd(a) serum.

Using RT-PCR, Dohi et al. (1996) found that 6 of 9 cases of gastric
cancer and 9 of 13 cases of colonic cancer lacked B4GALNT2 transcript.
These results correlated with a lack of B4GALNT2 activity measured in
the same samples. Dohi et al. (1996) concluded that reduced B4GALNT2
transcription results in disappearance of the Sd(a) epitope in
gastrointestinal cancer.

Montiel et al. (2003) found that a soluble B4GALNT2 protein N-terminally
truncated at gly89 could transfer N-acetylgalactosamine to several
natural and synthetic acceptor substrates, but it required a galactose
residue to be beta-1,3-linked to an N-acetylglucosamine or
N-acetylgalactosamine residue or beta-1,4-linked to glucose or an
N-acetylglucosamine residue.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Data on gene frequencies of allelic variants were tabulated by
Roychoudhury and Nei (1988).

ANIMAL MODEL

Type I von Willebrand disease (VWD1; 193400), characterized by reduced
levels of plasma von Willebrand factor (VWF; 613160), is the most common
inherited bleeding disorder in humans. Mohlke et al. (1996) noted that
penetrance of VWD is incomplete, and expression of the bleeding
phenotype is highly variable. In addition, plasma VWF levels vary widely
among normal individuals. It is likely that the wide range of severity,
variable expressivity, and incomplete penetrance of von Willebrand
disease eventually may be explained through a complex series of
interactions between the VWF gene and a variety of modifier genes,
including proteins involved in posttranslational processing and other
aspects of VWF biosynthesis and clearance. To identify genes that
influence VWF level, Mohlke et al. (1996) analyzed a genetic cross
between 2 strains of mice that exhibit a 20-fold difference in plasma
Vwf levels (Sweeney et al., 1990). DNA samples from F2 progeny
demonstrating either extremely high or extremely low plasma Vwf levels
were pooled and phenotyped for 41 markers spanning the autosomal genome.
A novel locus accounting for 63% of the total variance in Vwf levels was
mapped to distal mouse chromosome 11, a site distinct from the murine
Vwf locus on chromosome 6. Mohlke et al. (1996) designated the locus
Mvwf for 'modifier of Vwf.' Additional genotyping of as many as 2,407
meioses established a high resolution genetic map placing the gene
between Ngfr (162010) and Hoxb9 (142964), and it was closely linked to
Gip (137240). The Mvwf candidate interval between Ngfr and Hoxb9 was
approximately 0.5 cM. The results of Mohlke et al. (1996) demonstrated
that a single dominant gene accounted for the low Vwf phenotype of 1
strain of mice and crosses with several other strains. The pattern of
inheritance suggested a gain-of-function mutation in a unique component
of Vwf biosynthesis or processing. They commented that characterization
of the human homolog for Mvwf may have relevance for a subset of type 1
VWD cases and may define an important genetic factor modifying
penetrance and expression of mutations at the VWF locus.

GALGT2 is expressed primarily in the gut epithelium in both mice and
humans. Mohlke et al. (1999) found that Mvwf, the gene responsible for
modifying plasma levels of Vwf in a strain of mice, was Galgt2. They
showed that the mutation causing deficiency of Vwf changed expression of
the gene from gut specific to the vascular endothelium. Ginsburg (1999)
expressed the opinion that the same alteration is highly unlikely in
humans. However, the Mvwf modifier gene effect may be a useful paradigm
for understanding genetic modification of plasma VWF levels.

611542	TITLE *611542 ARYLSULFATASE B; ARSB
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The ARSB gene encodes arylsulfatase B (N-acetylgalactosamine
4-sulfatase; EC 3.1.6.12), a lysosomal enzyme that removes the C4
sulfate ester group from the N-acetylgalactosamine sugar residue at the
nonreducing terminus of the glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) dermatan sulfate
and chondroitin sulfate during lysosomal degradation (Karageorgos et
al., 2007).

CLONING

Schuchman et al. (1990) cloned a full-length ARSB cDNA from a human
testes cDNA library. The deduced 533-residue protein has 6 potential
N-glycosylation sites. Comparison of the predicted amino acid sequences
of arylsulfatases A (ARSA; 607574), B, and C (ARSC; 300747) demonstrated
regions of identity, particularly in their N termini.

Kunieda et al. (1995) isolated the rat Arsb gene.

GENE STRUCTURE

The ARSB gene contains 8 exons and spans about 206 kb (Karageorgos et
al., 2007).

MAPPING

Hellkuhl and Grzeschik (1978) assigned a gene for arylsulfatase B to
chromosome 5 by human-mouse somatic cell hybrids. By somatic cell
hybridization methods, DeLuca et al. (1979) assigned arylsulfatases A
and B to chromosomes 22 and 5, respectively. By study of an interstitial
deletion of 5q12, Dudin et al. (1984) excluded ARSB and HEXB from this
segment.

Fidzianska et al. (1984) assigned the ARSB locus to 5p11-qter by
analysis of somatic cell hybrids isolated from 2 separate fusions of
human fibroblasts carrying a translocation involving chromosome 5 with a
Chinese hamster cell line. By study of rearranged chromosomes in
human/hamster hybrids, using a tritium-labeled human genomic DNA
fragment for in situ hybridization, Fidzianska et al. (1986) narrowed
the assignment of ARSB to 5q11-q13.

Litjens et al. (1989) localized the ARSB gene to 5q13-q14.

By rat/mouse somatic cell hybridization, Kunieda et al. (1995) localized
the rat Arsb gene to chromosome 2.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a patient with mucopolysaccharidosis type VI (253200), Wicker et al.
(1991) identified a homozygous mutation in the ARSB gene (611542.0001).

In patients with MPS VI, Jin et al. (1992) identified homozygous or
compound heterozygous mutations in the ARSB gene
(611532.0002-611542.0004).

In 9 patients with MPS VI, Litjens et al. (1996) identified several
mutations in the ARSB gene (see, e.g., 611542.0008-611542.0010). All
patients were compound heterozygotes and showed variable phenotypes
ranging from mild to severe. For each patient, the combined biochemical
phenotypes of the 2 mutant sulfatase alleles demonstrated a good
correspondence with the observed clinical phenotype.

Litjens and Hopwood (2001) stated that a total of 45 clinically relevant
mutations had been identified in the ARSB gene in patients with
mucopolysaccharidosis type VI. Missense mutations represented the
largest group, with 31 identified. No common mutations had been
described, making screening of the general population difficult.

Karageorgos et al. (2007) identified 83 different ARSB mutations among
105 patients with MPS VI. The most frequent mutation was Y210C
(611542.0009), which was identified in 18% of patients and associated
with an attenuated phenotype.

Among 12 Spanish and 4 Argentinian patients with MPS VI, Garrido et al.
(2007) identified 19 different mutations, including 9 novel mutations,
in the ARSB gene. The most common mutant alleles were splice site
mutations, 611542.0011 and 611542.0012, which accounted for 21.9% and
12.5% of mutant alleles, respectively.

ANIMAL MODEL

Yoshida et al. (1993) reported the clinical, morphologic, and
biochemical features of a rat model of MPS VI. Affected rats had facial
dysmorphia, dysostosis multiplex, and increased urinary excretion of
glucosaminoglycans. Ultrastructural studies revealed storage of GAGs
throughout the reticuloendothelial cells, cartilage, and other
connective tissues, but no deposition was observed in the nervous
system. Biochemical analyses demonstrated that the excreted GAG was
dermatan sulfate and the activity of hepatic arylsulfatase B was less
than 5% of the normal mean value. Pedigree analysis showed that the
phenotype was inherited as an autosomal recessive single trait. Yoshida
et al. (1994) demonstrated that the responsible gene lies on rat
chromosome 2. It had been known that some loci on rat chromosome 2
correspond to those on human chromosome 5 and mouse chromosome 13.
Kunieda et al. (1995) demonstrated furthermore MPS VI in rats was due to
a homozygous 1-bp insertion (507insC) in the Arsb gene, resulting in a
frameshift and premature termination at codon 258.

Evers et al. (1996) produced a targeted disruption of the Arsb gene in
mice and found that homozygous mutant animals exhibited arylsulfatase B
enzyme deficiency and elevated urinary secretion of dermatan sulfate.
They developed progressive symptoms resembling those of MPS VI in
humans. Around 4 weeks of age, facial dysmorphism became overt, long
bones were shortened, and pelvic and costal abnormalities were observed.
Major alterations in bone formation with perturbed cartilaginous tissues
in newborns and widened, perturbed, and persisting growth plates in
adult animals were seen. All major parenchymal organs showed storage of
glycosaminoglycans preferentially in interstitial cells and macrophages.
Affected mice were fertile and mortality was not elevated up to 15
months of age.

McGovern et al. (1985) studied the mutant arylsulfatase B enzymes in
homozygotes for separately ascertained cat lines with MPS VI. They
showed that the enzymes were distinguishable in physicokinetic and
immunologic properties as well as in ability to dimerize with normal
enzyme in heterozygotes.

Yogalingam et al. (1996) studied the Arsb (feline f4S) gene in MPS VI
Siamese cats. They cloned the gene from a normal feline heart cDNA
library, sequenced it, and identified a missense mutation (leu476pro;
L476P) in the gene in MPS VI cats. Expression of the normal f4S gene,
accompanied by mannose-6-phosphate (M6P), corrected the lysosomal
storage of undegraded sulfated glycosaminoglycans in these cells. The
observation suggested that expression of the normal f4S gene in MPS VI
myoblasts is predominantly mediated by an M6P receptor (154540).

Crawley et al. (1996) used a feline model of MPS VI to investigate
enzyme replacement therapy. They evaluated tissue distribution and
clinical efficacy of 3 forms of recombinant human
N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfatase. Intravenously administered enzyme was
rapidly cleared from the circulation. The majority of the enzyme was
distributed to the liver but was also detected in most other tissues.
Tissue half-life was approximately 2-4 days. In 3 MPS VI cats, regular
intravenous infusions of recombinant enzyme for up to 20 months showed
variable reduction of storage vacuoles in Kupffer cells and connective
tissues; however, cartilage chondrocytes remained vacuolated. Vertebral
bone mineral volume was improved in 2 MPS VI cats in which therapy was
initiated before skeletal maturity, and increased bone volume appeared
to correlate with earlier age of onset of therapy. One cat showed
greater mobility in response to therapy. Crawley et al. (1996) suggested
that, given their results, significant reduction in disease progression
and tissue pathology might be expected in patients with this disorder.

Crawley et al. (1997) reported a dose-related response effect of enzyme
replacement therapy in MPS VI cats treated from birth. The evidence came
from clinical, biochemical, and histopathologic observations.

Crawley et al. (1998) stated that the family of cats with MPS VI used
for testing the efficacy of enzyme replacement therapy were homozygous
for the L476P substitution in the Arsb gene. An additional mutation,
asp520asn (D520N), inherited independently from L476P and identified in
the same family of cats, resulted in 3 clinical phenotypes: L476P
homozygotes exhibited dwarfism and facial dysmorphia due to epiphyseal
dysplasia, abnormal low leukocyte 4S/beta-hexosaminidase ratios,
dermatan sulfaturia, lysosomal inclusions in most tissues (including
chondrocytes), corneal clouding, degenerative joint disease, and
abnormal leukocyte inclusions. Similarly, D520N/D520N and L476P/D520N
cats had abnormally low leukocyte 4S/beta-hexosaminidase ratios, mild
dermatan sulfaturia, lysosomal inclusions in some chondrocytes, and
abnormal leukocyte inclusions; however, both had normal growth and
appearance. In addition, L476P/D520N cats had a high incidence of
degenerative joint disease. Crawley et al. (1998) concluded that
L476P/D520N cats have a very mild MPS VI phenotype not previously
described in MPS VI humans. Yogalingam et al. (1998), from the same
group, also reported biochemical and clinical assessment of L476P
homozygous, D520N/L476P compound heterozygous, and D520N homozygous
cats. They showed that the entire range of clinical phenotypes, from
severe MPS VI, to mild MPS VI, to normal were clustered within a narrow
range of residual 4S activity from 0.5 to 4.6% of normal levels. The
results suggested that the D520N mutation causes a rapid degradation of
4S protein. The effect of this is partially ameliorated as a result of a
significant elevation in the specific activity of mutant D520N 4S
reaching the lysosomes.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MUCOPOLYSACCHARIDOSIS TYPE VI, INTERMEDIATE
ARSB, GLY137VAL

In a patient with mucopolysaccharidosis type VI (253200), born of
consanguineous parents, Wicker et al. (1991) identified a homozygous
410G-T transversion in the ARSB gene, resulting in a gly137-to-val
(G137V) substitution. The mutation did not affect protein synthesis, but
severely reduced protein stability. The phenotype was of intermediate
severity.

.0002
MUCOPOLYSACCHARIDOSIS TYPE VI, SEVERE
ARSB, CYS117ARG

In a patient with severe MPS VI (253200), Jin et al. (1992) identified a
homozygous 349T-C transition in the ARSB gene, resulting in a
cys117-to-arg (C117R) substitution. The patient's cultured fibroblasts
showed about 2% of normal arylsulfatase B activity compared to a value
of about 7% in cultured fibroblasts from a patient with mild MPS VI
(L236P; 611542.0003).

MUCOPOLYSACCHARIDOSIS TYPE VI, MILD
ARSB, LEU236PRO

In a patient with mild MPS VI (253200), Jin et al. (1992) identified
compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the ARSB gene: a 707T-C
transition resulting in a leu236-to-pro (L236P) substitution, and a
1214G-A transition resulting in a cys405-to-tyr (C405Y; 611542.0004)
substitution. The patient's cultured fibroblasts showed about 7% of
normal arylsulfatase B activity compared to a value of about 2% in
cultured fibroblasts from a patient with severe MPS VI (C117R;
611542.0002).

MUCOPOLYSACCHARIDOSIS TYPE VI, SEVERE
ARSB, 1-BP DEL, 238G

In an 11-year-old boy with severe MPS VI (253200), Litjens et al. (1992)
identified a homozygous 1-bp deletion (238delG), resulting in a
frameshift and premature termination at codon 113. As an infant, he had
coarse dysmorphic features, advanced bone age, dysostosis multiplex, and
corneal clouding. Hydrocephalus required shunting at 4 years, and
cervical cord compression resulting from upper cervical instability
required surgical stabilization at 6 years of age.

.0006
MUCOPOLYSACCHARIDOSIS TYPE VI, SEVERE
ARSB, 1-BP DEL, 743C

In a child with a severe form of Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome (253200),
Isbrandt et al. (1996) identified compound heterozygosity for 2
deletions in the ARSB gene. One allele carried a 1-bp deletion (743delC)
in exon 4 resulting in a frameshift and premature termination. The
protein was predicted to be 221 amino acids, which is less than 42% of
the 533 amino acid wildtype enzyme. The second allele carried an 11-bp
deletion in exon 1 and a leu72-to-gln substitution (611542.0007). The
patient presented at 2.5 years with facial dysmorphism, scoliosis and
dysostosis multiplex, corneal clouding, hepatomegaly, and umbilical
hernia. At age 7 years, he had short stature, severe kyphoscoliosis,
restriction of joint movement, and pyramidal symptoms.

MUCOPOLYSACCHARIDOSIS TYPE VI, SEVERE
ARSB, 11-BP DEL AND LEU72GLN

In a child with severe Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome (253200), Isbrandt et al.
(1996) found a 1-bp deletion in the ARSB gene (611542.0006) and an 11-bp
deletion which resulted in premature termination and a shortened protein
predicted to be less than 23% of the length of the wildtype enzyme. In
addition to the 11-bp deletion, they observed a 215T-A transversion
resulting in a leu72-to-gln (L72Q) substitution on the same allele.

.0008
MUCOPOLYSACCHARIDOSIS TYPE VI
ARSB, ARG95GLN

In a patient with a severe form of MPS VI (253200), Litjens et al.
(1996) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the ARSB
gene: a 284G-A transition resulting in an arg95-to-gln (R95Q)
substitution, and H393P (611542.0010). She presented at age 13 months
with mild developmental delay, thoracolumbar kyphosis,
hepatosplenomegaly, and skeletal changes characteristic of the disorder.
In another family, 2 sibs with a mild form of MPS VI were compound
heterozygous for R95Q and Y210C (611542.0009). Functional expression
studies in CHO cells showed that the R95Q mutant retained about 0.02%
residual activity.

629A-G transition resulting in a tyr210-to-cys (Y210C) substitution, and
R95Q (611542.0008). An additional unrelated patient with an intermediate
phenotype was compound heterozygous for Y210C and H393P (611542.0010).
Functional expression studies in CHO cells showed that the Y210C mutant
retained about 2% residual activity.

In a patient with a severe form of MPS VI (253200), Litjens et al.
(1996) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the ARSB
gene: a 1178A-C transversion resulting in a his393-to-pro (H393P)
substitution, and R95Q (611542.0008) Functional expression studies in
CHO cells showed that the H393P mutant expressed no ARSB protein and
thus had no residual activity.

;;SCAVENGER RECEPTOR EXPRESSED BY ENDOTHELIAL CELLS; SREC;;
SREC1;;
SREC I;;
KIAA0149
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Scavenger receptors mediate the endocytosis of chemically modified
lipoproteins. SCARF1 specifically mediates the selective uptake of
acetylated low density lipoprotein (Ac-LDL) into endothelial cells.

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a myeloid leukemia cell cDNA library,
Nagase et al. (1995) cloned SCARF1, which they designated KIAA0149. The
deduced 830-amino acid protein contains a putative transmembrane domain
and an EGF-like pattern of cysteine repeats. SCARF1 shares about 33%
identity over 147 amino acids with mouse Tie2 (600221), an epithelial
receptor tyrosine kinase. The 3-prime untranslated region contains an
Alu repeat. Northern blot analysis detected expression in most tissues
examined, with highest levels in lung and spleen. No expression was
detected in HeLa cells, pancreas, or colon.

Adachi et al. (1997) cloned SCARF1, which they designated SREC, using an
expression cloning strategy in which they assayed for uptake of
fluorescence-labeled Ac-LDL into CHO cells transfected with a human
umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) cDNA library. The deduced
830-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of about 86 kD.
SCARF1 contains a hydrophobic signal sequence followed by 5 EGF-like
cysteine pattern signatures in its extracellular N-terminal half, a
transmembrane region, and an intracellular C-terminal half containing a
serine/proline-rich region followed by a glycine-rich region. It has 3
potential N-glycosylation sites and several putative sites for serine
and threonine phosphorylation. Northern blot analysis revealed a 3.5-kb
transcript expressed in HUVECs and in coronary artery endothelial cells,
but not in coronary artery smooth muscle cells.

Adachi and Tsujimoto (2002) identified several SCARF1 variants in a
peripheral blood leukocyte cDNA library. Alternative splicing introduces
a stop codon before the transmembrane region in 2 of the variants,
resulting in soluble forms of SCARF1.

GENE FUNCTION

Adachi et al. (1997) determined that CHO cells stably expressing SCARF1
bound radiolabeled Ac-LDL with high affinity and degraded it via an
endocytic pathway. The association between SCARF1 and Ac-LDL was
inhibited by oxidized LDL, malondialdehyde-modified LDL, dextran
sulfate, and polyinosinic acid, but not by natural LDL or heparin.

Adachi and Tsujimoto (2002) determined that all membrane-bound splice
variants of SCARF1 showed receptor activity toward Ac-LDL. They
identified a transcriptional activator of SCARF1, ZNF444 (607874).
Overexpression of ZNF444 in HUVECs increased SCARF1 promoter activity
nearly 2.5-fold. An intact SP1 (189906) motif and an intact inverted
repeat sequence with a triple-nucleotide spacer (IR3), which binds
ZNF444, were required for maximal SCARF1 expression. Several
inflammatory cytokines inhibited SCARF1 promoter activity in vitro and
decreased Ac-LDL uptake in vivo.

Means et al. (2009) showed that the scavenger receptors Scarf1 and Cd36
(173510) mediated mouse defense against 2 fungal pathogens, Cryptococcus
neoformans and Candida albicans, by enabling production of antimicrobial
peptides. Studies in C. elegans indicated that the homologous proteins
protected nematodes. Macrophage binding and cytokine production required
Cd36, but not Tlr2 (603028), and binding was dependent on recognition of
pathogen beta-glucans. Mice lacking Cd36, but expressing other
beta-glucan receptors (e.g., CLEC7A; 606264), had a higher fungal burden
and greater mortality after intravenous infection with C. neoformans
compared with wildtype mice. Means et al. (2009) concluded that SCARF1
and CD36 are beta-glucan-binding receptors and are involved in an
evolutionarily conserved pathway for the innate sensing of fungal
pathogens.

GENE STRUCTURE

Adachi and Tsujimoto (2002) determined that the SCARF1 gene contains 11
exons and spans 12 kb. The 5-prime flanking region lacks TATA and CCAAT
boxes, but it contains several putative motifs for DNA-binding elements,
including an SP1 motif and an IR3 sequence that binds ZNF444.

MAPPING

By PCR of a human/rodent hybrid panel, Nagase et al. (1995) mapped the
SCARF1 gene to chromosome 17.

;;SNAP23A

SNAP23E
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Synaptosomal-associated proteins (SNAPs), such as SNAP23, are involved
in the process of membrane fusion in intracellular vesicle traffic
(Ravichandran et al., 1996).

CLONING

Ravichandran et al. (1996) used syntaxin-4 (186591) as bait in
expression cloning to isolate novel proteins involved in membrane fusion
in other cell types. From a human B-cell lymphocyte library, they
identified SNAP23, which shows homology to SNAP25 (600322). SNAP25 is
part of a complex, termed 'SNARE,' that is responsible for membrane
fusion in neurons. The SNAP23 cDNA encodes a 211-amino acid polypeptide
with a predicted mass of 23 kD. Its amino acid sequence is 59% identical
to that of SNAP25. Northern blot analysis revealed that SNAP23 is
ubiquitously expressed.

Mollinedo and Lazo (1997) used RT-PCR to identify an alternatively
spliced variant of SNAP23 in human neutrophils. This isoform, termed
SNAP23B, encodes a protein sequence of 158 amino acids with a deduced
mass of 17.8 kD. Lazo et al. (2001) determined that SNAP23B lacks a
region that is required for nonspecific binding to plasma membranes.

Shukla et al. (2001) identified 3 additional splice variants that they
designated SNAP23C, SNAP23D, and SNAP23E, all of which showed deletions
in comparison with SNAP23A. With use of variant-specific primers in
RT-PCR, they found mRNA for all 5 SNAP23 variants in human eosinophils,
peripheral blood mononuclear cells, neutrophils, brain tissue, and
basophilic and eosinophilic cell lines. Transfection of a basophilic
cell line with reporter constructs for each of these variants revealed a
plasma membrane localization for SNAPA and SNAPB, and both membrane and
intracellular localization for SNAP23C, SNAPD, and SNAP23E.

GENE FUNCTION

Ravichandran et al. (1996) determined that SNAP23 is able to bind to
multiple syntaxins as well as to multiple vesicle-associated membrane
proteins (see 185880).

Guo et al. (1998) reported that SNAP23 relocates in response to
stimulation from plasma membrane lamellipodia-like projections to
granule membranes in permeabilized mast cells. While relocation is a
prerequisite for secretion, it can occur without membrane fusion and
will expedite a subsequent secretory response. After relocation, SNAP23
is required for exocytosis, implying a crucial role in promoting
membrane fusion. Thus, relocation of SNAP23 regulates compound
exocytosis and links granule-plasma membrane and granule-granule
fusions.

Using immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy, Galli et al.
(1998) demonstrated that human TIVAMP (VAMP7; 300053), syntaxin-3
(STX3A; 600876), and SNAP23, were insensitive to proteolysis by numerous
clostridial neurotoxins (NTs). TIVAMP-containing vesicles were
concentrated in the apical domain of epithelial cells. STX3A and SNAP23
were codistributed at the apical plasma membrane, where they formed
N-ethyl maleimide-dependent SNARE complexes with TIVAMP and cellubrevin
(VAMP3; 603657). Galli et al. (1998) proposed that TIVAMP, STX3A, and
SNAP23 participate in exocytotic processes at the apical plasma membrane
of epithelial cells and in clostridial NT-resistant pathways.

Using RT-PCR, immunoblot analysis, and immunofluorescence microscopy,
Sander et al. (2008) demonstrated that human intestinal mast cells (MCs)
expressed SNAP23, STX1B (601485), STX2 (132350), STX3, STX4 (STX4A;
186591), and STX6 (603944), but not SNAP25. MCs also expressed VAMP3,
VAMP7, and VAMP8 (603177), but, in contrast with rodent MCs, they
expressed only low levels of VAMP2 (185881). VAMP7 and VAMP8
translocated to the plasma membrane and interacted with SNAP23 and STX4
upon activation. Inhibition of STX4, SNAP23, VAMP7, or VAMP8, but not
VAMP2 or VAMP3, resulted in markedly reduced high-affinity IgE
receptor-mediated histamine release. Sander et al. (2008) concluded that
human MCs express a specific pattern of SNAREs and that VAMP7 and VAMP8,
but not VAMP2, are required for rapid degranulation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lazo et al. (2001) found that the SNAP23 gene has 8 exons, with the
initiation codon located in exon 2. They determined that SNAP23B is the
result of alternative splicing where exon 5 is joined to exon 7,
skipping exon 6.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Lazo et al. (2001) mapped the
SNAP23 gene to chromosome 15q21-q22. Lazo et al. (2001) suggested that
alterations in the SNAP23 gene may be involved in neurologic and other
diseases with defects in vesicle-membrane fusion processes that map to
15q15-q21.
