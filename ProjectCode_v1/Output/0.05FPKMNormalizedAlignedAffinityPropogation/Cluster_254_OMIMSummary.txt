601613	TITLE *601613 CHEMOKINE, CXC MOTIF, RECEPTOR 5; CXCR5
;;BURKITT LYMPHOMA RECEPTOR 1; BLR1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Dobner et al. (1992) and Kaiser et al. (1993) identified a novel member
of the G protein-coupled receptor family termed BLR1 (BLR1 having been
identified from Burkitt lymphoma).

GENE FUNCTION

B lymphocytes recirculate between B cell-rich compartments (follicles or
B zones) in secondary lymphoid organs, surveying for antigen. After
antigen binding, B cells move to the boundary of B and T zones to
interact with T-helper cells. Reif et al. (2002) demonstrated that
antigen-engaged B cells have increased expression of CCR7 (600242), the
receptor for the T-zone chemokines CCL19 (602227) and CCL21 (602737),
and that they exhibit increased responsiveness to both chemoattractants.
In mice lacking lymphoid CCL19 and CCL21 chemokines, or with B cells
that lack CCR7, antigen engagement fails to cause movement to the T
zone. Using retroviral-mediated gene transfer, the authors demonstrated
that increased expression of CCR7 is sufficient to direct B cells to the
T zone. Reciprocally, overexpression of CXCR5, the receptor for the
B-zone chemokine CXCL13 (also known as BLC), is sufficient to overcome
antigen-induced B-cell movement to the T zone. Reif et al. (2002)
concluded that their findings defined the mechanism of B-cell
relocalization in response to antigen, and established that cell
position in vivo can be determined by the balance of responsiveness to
chemoattractants made in separate but adjacent zones.

Chan et al. (2003) investigated the expression of chemokines and
chemokine receptors in eyes with primary intraocular B-cell lymphoma
(PIOL). All 3 PIOL eyes showed similar pathology, with typical diffuse
large B-lymphoma cells between the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and
Bruch membrane. The eyes also showed a similar chemokine profile with
the expression of CXCR4 (162643) and CXCR5 in the lymphoma cells. CXCL13
(BLC) and CXCL12 (600835) transcripts were found only in the RPE and not
in the malignant cells. No chemokine expression was detected on the RPE
cells of a normal control eye. Since chemokines and chemokine receptors
selective for B cells were identified in RPE and malignant B cells in
eyes with PIOL, inhibition of B-cell chemoattractants might be a future
strategy for the treatment of PIOL.

The germinal center (GC) is organized into dark and light zones. B cells
in the dark zone, called centroblasts, undergo rapid proliferation and
somatic hypermutation of their antibody variable genes. Centroblasts
then become smaller, nondividing centrocytes and undergo selection in
the light zone based on the affinity of their surface antibody for the
inducing antigen. The light zone also contains helper T cells and
follicular dendritic cells that sequester antigen. Failure to
differentiate results in centrocyte apoptosis, whereas centrocytes that
bind antigen and receive T-cell help emigrate from the GC as long-lived
plasma cells or memory B cells. Some centrocytes may also return to the
dark zone for further proliferation and mutation. Using genetic and
pharmacologic approaches, Allen et al. (2004) showed that CXCR4 was
essential for GC dark and light zone segregation. In the presence of the
antiapoptotic BCL2 (151430), B cells had robust chemotactic responses to
the CXCR4 ligand, CXCL12, as well as to CXCL13, the ligand for CXCR5.
CXCL12 was more abundant in the dark zone, and CXCR4 was more abundant
on centroblasts than centrocytes. In contrast, CXCR5 helped direct cells
to the CXCL13-positive light zone, but was not essential for segregation
of the 2 zones. CXCL13 and CXCR5 were required for correct positioning
of the light zone. Allen et al. (2004) concluded that these chemokines
and their receptors are critical for movement of cells to different
parts of the GC and for creating the distinct histologic appearance of
the GC.

Using flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry, Cagigi et al. (2008)
found that human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 (see
609423)-seropositive patients, particularly those with low CD4
(186940)-positive T-cell counts, had reduced expression of CXCR5 on B
cells, whereas expression of its ligand, CXCL13, was increased. CXCL13
was secreted upon B-cell activation. CXCL13-positive B cells were
present in lymph nodes of HIV-1-seropositive patients, but not in
control tissue. Cagigi et al. (2008) concluded that altered expression
of CXCR5 and CXCL13 may be involved in B-cell dysfunction during HIV-1
infection.

ANIMAL MODEL

Forster et al. (1996) described the phenotype of gene-targeted mice
lacking the putative chemokine receptor Blr1. In normal mice, this
receptor is expressed on mature B cells and a subpopulation of T helper
cells. Blr1-mutant mice lack inguinal lymph nodes and possess no or only
a few phenotypically abnormal Peyer patches. The migration of
lymphocytes into splenic follicles was severely impaired, resulting in
morphologically altered primary lymphoid follicles. Furthermore,
activated B cells failed to migrate from the T cell-rich zone into
B-cell follicles of the spleen, and despite high numbers of germinal
center founder cells, no functional germinal centers developed in this
organ. These results identified BLR1 as the first G protein-coupled
receptor involved in B cell migration and localization of these cells
within specific anatomic compartments.

CXCR5 was known to be required for B cell migration to splenic
follicles, but the requirements for homing to B-cell areas and lymph
nodes remained to be defined. Ansel et al. (2000) demonstrated that
lymph nodes contain 2 types of B cell-rich compartment: follicles
containing follicular dendritic cells, and areas lacking such cells.
Ansel et al. (2000) generated mice deficient in the B-lymphocyte
chemoattractant (BLC; 605149), for which CXCR5 is the receptor, by
targeted disruption. BLC-deficient mice were similar in appearance to
mice deficient in CXCR5. However, CXCR5-deficient mice have less severe
deficiency in Peyer patches. Using BLC-deficient mice, Ansel et al.
(2000) established that BLC and CXCR5 are needed for B-cell homing to
follicles in lymph nodes as well as in spleen. They also found that BLC
is required for the development of most lymph nodes and Peyer patches.
In addition to mediating chemoattraction, BLC induces B cells to
upregulate membrane lymphotoxin alpha-1-beta-2 (see 600978), a cytokine
that promotes follicular dendritic cell development and BLC expression,
establishing a positive feedback loop thought to be important in
follicle development and homeostasis. In germinal centers, the feedback
loop is overridden, with B cell lymphotoxin alpha-1-beta-2 expression
being induced by a mechanism independent of BLC.

Voigt et al. (2000) found that B cells and dendritic cells do
colocalize, albeit aberrantly, even in the absence of CXCR5. In mice
lacking Cxcr5, both cell types were found in a broad ring around the
sinuses of the marginal zones. Voigt et al. (2000) concluded that in
Cxcr5-deficient mice, the organization of splenic primary follicles is
severely impaired. However, within the T cell zone a microenvironment is
built up, which provides all requirements needed for the affinity
maturation to take place.

Prinz et al. (2003) found that in mice deficient in Cxcr5 the follicular
dendritic cells (FDCs) are juxtaposed to major splenic nerves and the
transfer of intraperitoneally-administered prions (see 176640) into the
spinal cord is accelerated. Neuroinvasion velocity correlated
exclusively with the relative locations of FDCs and nerves; transfer of
Cxcr5 -/- bone marrow to wildtype mice induced perineural FDCs and
enhanced neuroinvasion, whereas reciprocal transfer to Cxcr5 -/- mice
abolished them and restored normal efficiency of neuroinvasion.
Suppression of lymphotoxin signaling depleted FDCs, abolished splenic
infectivity, and suppressed acceleration of pathogenesis in Cxcr5 -/-
mice. Prinz et al. (2003) concluded that their data suggests that prion
neuroimmune transition occurs between FDCs and sympathetic nerves, and
relative positioning of FDCs and nerves controls the efficiency of
peripheral prion infection.

607001	TITLE *607001 EUCHROMATIC HISTONE METHYLTRANSFERASE 1; EHMT1
;;EUHMTASE1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Ogawa et al. (2002) identified the components of the E2F6 (602944)
complex, which represses transcription. Although histone acetylase and
deacetylase activities were not detected in the E2F6 complex,
methyltransferase activity was. Ogawa et al. (2002) identified
euchromatic histone methyltransferase-1 as a component of the E2F6
complex. The 1,267-amino acid EU-HMTase-1 protein contains ankyrin
repeats and a SET domain. EU-HMTase-1 shares 63% sequence similarity
with NG36/G9A (604599). EU-HMTase-1 exhibited histone methyltransferase
activity with a specificity for histone H3 in core histones, whereas it
hardly methylated nucleosomes, suggesting that other subunits in the
E2F6 complex are required for modification of nucleosomal substrates.
Ogawa et al. (2002) demonstrated that lysine-9 of histone H3 is the
target of euchromatic histone methyltransferase-1.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kleefstra et al. (2006) stated that the EHMT1 gene contains 28 exons.
The initiation ATG occurs in exon 2.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

The chromosome 9q subtelomeric deletion syndrome, or Kleefstra syndrome
(610253), is a mental retardation syndrome that was thought to be caused
by small interstitial deletions in the 9q subtelomeric region. Kleefstra
et al. (2005) characterized the breakpoints in a female with a balanced
translocation t(X;9)(p11.23;q34.3) and found that the chromosome
breakpoint disrupted the EHMT1 gene in intron 9. The patient presented
typical features of 9q subtelomeric deletion syndrome, which suggested
that the core phenotype of this entity is due to haploinsufficiency of
EHMT1. Kleefstra et al. (2006) performed a comprehensive mutation
analysis of the EHMT1 gene in 23 patients with clinical presentations
consistent with 9q subtelomeric deletion syndrome. Three patients had
microdeletions that comprised the EHMT1 gene; 1 interstitial deletion
reduced the critical region for this syndrome. Two patients had de novo
mutations, a nonsense mutation and a frameshift mutation, in the EHMT1
gene (607001.0001-607001.0002). These results appeared to establish that
haploinsufficiency of EHMT1 is causative for the 9q subtelomeric
deletion syndrome.

In 6 of 24 patients with a clinical phenotype consistent with 9q
deletion syndrome who had normal chromosome studies, Kleefstra et al.
(2009) identified 6 different intragenic mutations in the EHMT1 gene
(see, e.g., C1042Y, 607001.0003 and R260X, 607001.0004). There were 2
nonsense mutations, a deletion, 2 splice site mutations, and 1 missense
mutation in a highly conserved residue. A comparison of the phenotype
between these 6 patients and 16 additional patients with larger
deletions of 9q showed no genotype/phenotype correlations. Kleefstra et
al. (2009) concluded that haploinsufficiency for EHMT1 is the basis for
the phenotypic features in this disorder.

ANIMAL MODEL

Schaefer et al. (2009) found that conditional ablation of Ehmt2 (604599)
or Ehmt1 in postnatal mouse forebrain neurons caused a reduction in
euchromatic H3K9 methylation in the forebrain and
upregulation/derepression of neuronal and nonneuronal genes (e.g., AFP;
104150), including those involved in developmental stage-dependent gene
expression (e.g., Dach2; 300608). These changes were not associated with
alterations in neuronal architecture or electrophysiologic features.
Mice with postnatal knockout of Ehmt1 or Ehmt2 in the forebrain showed
decreased exploratory behavior in a novel environment and had a decrease
in the preference for sucrose solution compared to wildtype mice, the
latter of which may indicate an underlying dysfunction in
motivation/reward. Both Ehmt2-null and Ehmt1-null mice became obese.
Ehmt1-null mice also showed defects in contextual and cued fear
conditioning, indicating a problem with learning and memory. Mice
lacking Ehmt2 specifically in Drd1 (126449)- or Drd2 (126450)-expressing
neurons in the striatum showed altered locomotor and behavioral
responses to Drd-specific receptor agonist or antagonists, reflecting
reductions of cell type-specific activity. The changes in these mice
resembled the features of the human chromosome 9q34.3 deletion syndrome.
Schaefer et al. (2009) concluded that Ehmt1 and Ehmt2 are key regulators
of cognition and adaptive behavior in adult mice through regulation of
transcriptional homeostasis.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
KLEEFSTRA SYNDROME
EHMT1, ARG1137TER

In a patient with clinical features of the 9q subtelomeric deletion
syndrome (610253), Kleefstra et al. (2006) identified a heterozygous
3409C-T transition in exon 24 of the EHMT1 gene that caused an
arg1137-to-stop substitution (R1137X).

.0002
KLEEFSTRA SYNDROME
EHMT1, 13-BP DEL

In a patient with clinical features of the 9q subtelomeric deletion
syndrome (610253), Kleefstra et al. (2006) identified a heterozygous
13-bp deletion in exon 8 of the EHMT1 gene (1320_1332del13). The
deletion resulted in a frameshift (P442fs) and a premature stop that
predicted a mutant protein of 526 amino acids.

.0003
KLEEFSTRA SYNDROME
EHMT1, CYS1042TYR

In a 20-year-old woman with a phenotype consistent with chromosome 9q
subtelomeric deletion syndrome (610253), Kleefstra et al. (2009)
identified a de novo heterozygous 3125G-A transition in the EHMT1 gene,
resulting in a cys1042-to-tyr (C1042Y) substitution in a highly
conserved residue in the pre-SET domain of the protein. Protein modeling
predicted that the substitution would abolish a strong cysteine-zinc
interaction and interfere with the local conformation of the pre-SET
domain. The phenotype was fully compatible with the deletion syndrome,
and included severe psychomotor retardation, hypotonia, and
characteristic facial features of midface hypoplasia, synophrys, and
eversion of the lower lip. She also had pulmonary stenosis. Kleefstra et
al. (2009) postulated loss of protein function and haploinsufficiency
rather than a dominant-negative effect.

.0004
KLEEFSTRA SYNDROME
EHMT1, ARG260TER

In a 19-year-old man with a phenotype consistent with chromosome 9q
subtelomeric deletion syndrome (610253), Kleefstra et al. (2009)
identified a de novo heterozygous 778C-T transition in the EHMT1 gene,
resulting in an arg260-to-ter (R260X) substitution, predicted to result
in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. The man had mental retardation,
seizures, and characteristic facial abnormalities.

607242	TITLE *607242 ADAPTOR-RELATED PROTEIN COMPLEX 2, ALPHA-2 SUBUNIT; AP2A2
;;KIAA0899
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By randomly sequencing cDNA clones from size-fractionated human brain
cDNA libraries, Nagase et al. (1998) identified AP2A2, which they
designated KIAA0899. The deduced 929-amino acid protein shares more than
97% sequence identity with rat alpha-adaptin. By RT-PCR analysis
followed by ELISA for quantitation, they detected ubiquitous,
low-to-moderate expression of KIAA0899, with highest levels in spinal
cord and fetal and adult brain and lowest levels in spleen.

Using the N terminus of huntingtin (HTT; 613004) in a yeast 2-hybrid
screen of a testis cDNA library, Faber et al. (1998) identified AP2A2,
which they designated huntingtin yeast partner J (HYPJ). The predicted
protein shares significant sequence identity with mouse alpha-adaptin C.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the AP2A2 gene
to chromosome 11.

604158	TITLE *604158 SECRETED FRIZZLED-RELATED PROTEIN 5; SFRP5
;;SECRETED APOPTOSIS-RELATED PROTEIN 3; SARP3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the 'frizzled' (FZ) transmembrane protein family (see 600667)
are receptors for Wnt family members (see 164975), cysteine-rich
glycosylated ligands implicated in a variety of cellular processes,
including control of cell polarity in a number of systems, including
Drosophila retina. Secreted frizzled-related proteins (SFRPs), such as
SFRP5, appear to act as soluble modulators of Wnt signaling by competing
with membrane-bound frizzled receptors for the binding of secreted Wnt
ligands (Chang et al., 1999).

CLONING

Chang et al. (1999) isolated bovine cDNAs encoding Sfrp5, an SFRP highly
expressed in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). By screening human
genomic and RPE/retina libraries, they identified human SFRP5 genomic
and cDNA clones. The predicted 317-amino acid human protein shares 98%
and 95% sequence identity with bovine and mouse Sfrp5, respectively.
Like other SFRPs, SFRP5 contains an N-terminal signal peptide followed
by a region homologous to the frizzled cysteine-rich domain (CRD). Chang
et al. (1999) reported that although human SFRP5 was expressed in the
RPE, Sfrp2 (604157) was highly and preferentially expressed in bovine
retina throughout the inner nuclear layer. Thus, photoreceptors appear
to be bathed by complementary gradients of SFRP signaling
molecules/modulators. The authors speculated that these putative inverse
gradients of SFRP2 and SFRP5 might be involved in determining the
polarity of photoreceptors and perhaps other cells in the retina.

Independently, Melkonyan et al. (1997) isolated cDNAs encoding the
related proteins SARP1 (SFRP2), SARP2 (SFRP1; 604156), and SARP3
(SFRP5). Northern blot analysis revealed that the 2.2-kb SARP3 mRNA is
expressed in pancreas.

GENE FUNCTION

Chang et al. (1999) found that SFRP5 inhibited Wnt signaling in an assay
based on Wnt8 (see 601396)-induced axis duplication in Xenopus embryos.

GENE STRUCTURE

Chang et al. (1999) determined that the SFRP5 gene contains 3 coding
exons.

MAPPING

Using fluorescence in situ hybridization, as well as radiation hybrid
and somatic cell hybrid analyses, Chang et al. (1999) determined that
the SFRP5 gene maps to chromosome 10q24.1.

ANIMAL MODEL

Li et al. (2008) found that Sfrp5-depleted Xenopus embryos had
dramatically reduced foregut gene expression and hypoplastic liver and
pancreatic buds. Cells of the foregut epithelium lacked apical-basal
polarity and were loosely adherent, resulting in collapse of the foregut
cavity. The foregut specification and morphogenesis defects were
separable and resulted from elevated canonical Wnt/beta-catenin and
noncanonical Wnt/planar cell polarity signaling, respectively, and both
were mediated by Wnt11 (603699). Furthermore, Sfrp5 locally inhibited
Wnt11 to maintain foregut identity and allow foregut epithelium to form
over the mass of deep endoderm.

Ouchi et al. (2010) demonstrated that Sfrp5, a protein linked to the Wnt
signaling pathway, is an antiinflammatory adipokine whose expression is
perturbed in models of obesity and type 2 diabetes (see 125853).
Sfrp5-deficient mice fed a high-calorie diet developed severe glucose
intolerance and hepatic steatosis, and their adipose tissue showed an
accumulation of activated macrophages that was associated with
activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK1; 601158) signaling
pathway. Adenovirus-mediated delivery of Sfrp5 to mouse models of
obesity ameliorated glucose intolerance and hepatic steatosis. Ouchi et
al. (2010) concluded that in the setting of obesity, Sfrp5 secretion by
adipocytes exerts salutary effects on metabolic dysfunction by
controlling inflammatory cells within adipose tissue.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

A cascade of protease reactions is believed to be responsible for the
apoptotic changes observed in mammalian cells undergoing programmed cell
death. This cascade involves members of the aspartate-specific cysteine
proteases of the ICE/CED3 (147678) family, also known as the caspase
family.

CLONING

Fernandes-Alnemri et al. (1996) identified the novel gene MCH5 when they
found a human EST sequence with significant homology to the newly
identified cysteine protease MCH4 (601762). They used PCR to clone a
cDNA of the MCH5 gene from a Jurkat T-cell cDNA library. Sequence
analysis revealed that it encodes a polypeptide of 496 amino acids with
greatest homology to MCH4. The authors found that MCH4 and MCH5 both
contain the active site pentapeptide QACQG instead of the QACRG present
in all other known members of the family. Furthermore, the authors found
that the sequences of MCH4 and MCH5 contain Fas-associating protein with
death domain (FADD)-like domains, suggesting possible interaction with
FADD. Fernandes-Alnemri et al. (1996) stated that MCH5, like other
members of the ICE/CED3 family, forms an active protease only after
cleavage of its proenzyme into 2 subunits which dimerize to form the
active enzyme.

Using MORT1 (FADD; 602457) in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a B-cell cDNA
library, Boldin et al. (1996) cloned several splice variants of CASP8,
which they called MACH. The isoforms could be divided into 2 main
subgroups. All isoforms share a common 182-amino acid N-terminal region,
including 2 MORT modules (i.e., death effector domains, or DEDs), but
they have different C termini. Subgroup alpha isoforms have C termini
containing a CED3/ICE homology domain that contains the catalytic site
and the substrate-binding pocket, while subgroup beta isoforms are
truncated and lack the CED3/ICE homology domain. The longest isoform,
MACH-alpha-1, encodes a deduced 479-amino acid protein. The CED3/ICE
domain of MACH-alpha-1 shares 41% and 34% identity with the homologous
regions in CPP32 (CASP3; 600636) and C. elegans CED3, respectively.
Northern blot analysis detected MACH transcripts ranging in size between
2.85 and 3.5 kb in all tissues examined, with highest levels in resting
peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes and lowest levels in testis and
skeletal muscle.

Eckhart et al. (2001) identified several CASP8 splice variants that
preferentially use a distant splice donor site at the 3-prime end of
exon 8. Use of this distant site, which they called exon 8b, results in
mRNAs with truncated open reading frames. RT-PCR indicated equal
expression of both mRNA species in tonsil, spleen, bone marrow, thymus,
and lymph nodes. Peripheral blood leukocytes, heart, and epidermis
predominantly expressed mRNA containing exon 8b, as did a promyelocytic
cell line and a T-cell line. Liver and nearly all immortalized cell
lines, as well as primary endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and
keratinocytes, expressed mRNA lacking the 8b extension.

GENE FUNCTION

Using fluorogenic peptide substrates corresponding to a sequence within
the nuclear protein PARP (173870), Boldin et al. (1996) confirmed that
MACH-alpha-1 is a thiol protease. By site-directed mutagenesis, they
identified cys360 as the catalytic cysteine. Using mutation analysis,
Boldin et al. (1996) determined that MACH binds to the N terminus of
MORT1. They also found that it self-associates, but it does not interact
directly with FAS/APO1 (TNRFSF6; 134637). Transfection of human
embryonic kidney cells and breast carcinoma cells with MACH-alpha-1 or
MACH-alpha-2 resulted in massive cell death.

Muzio et al. (1996) determined that CASP8, which they called FLICE,
interacts with wildtype FADD but not with FADD lacking the DED. They
also determined that granzyme B (GZMB; 123910) can remove the prodomain
and generate the active p20/p10 dimeric cysteine protease. Cleavage of
PARP by CASP8 resulted in the appearance of signature apoptotic
fragments. Transfection and overexpression of CASP8 in transfected
breast cancer cells resulted in apoptosis.

Expression of cDNAs that encode truncated polypeptides containing mostly
expanded polyglutamine repeats, but not of those that encode the
corresponding full-length proteins, has been shown to induce cell death
by apoptosis. Such truncated proteins have been shown to form aggregates
or inclusions (Ikeda et al., 1996). Sanchez et al. (1999) studied the
role of caspases in polyglutamine-induced cell death in established
cultures of primary cortical, striatal, and cerebellar neurons from
embryonic day 17 rat embryos, transfected with an expression construct
encoding truncated ataxin-3 that contained 79 glutamine (Q79) residues.
The authors showed that the apoptosis inhibitors Bcl2, CrmA, and a
truncated Fas/APO1-associated death domain protein (FADD DN) inhibited
polyglutamine repeat-induced neuronal cell death. A mutant Jurkat cell
line specifically lacking caspase-8 was resistant to
polyglutamine-induced cell death. Cells transfected with Q79 showed
insoluble inclusions. Caspase-8 was recruited and activated by these Q79
inclusions. Western blot analysis revealed the presence of activated
caspase-8 in the insoluble fraction of affected brain regions from
Huntington disease (143100) patients but not in those from controls. The
authors suggested that caspase-8 has an essential role in
Huntington-related neurodegenerative diseases.

Eckhart et al. (2001) found that different CASP8 isoforms were expressed
in resting and activated lymphocytes. Activation of lymphocytes shifted
the expression from mRNA species containing an exon 8b extension to
mRNAs that lack it. Differentiation in a promyelocytic cell line was
associated with the opposite shift, from mRNAs containing the shorter
exon 8 to mRNAs that include the exon 8b extension.

Gervais et al. (2002) found that HIP1 (601767) binds to the HIP1 protein
interactor (HIPPI; 606621), which has partial sequence homology to HIP1
and similar tissue and subcellular distribution. The availability of
free HIP1 is modulated by polyglutamine length within huntingtin
(613004), with disease-associated polyglutamine expansion favoring the
formation of proapoptotic HIPPI-HIP1 heterodimers. This heterodimer can
recruit procaspase-8 into a complex of HIPPI, HIP1, and procaspase-8,
and launch apoptosis through components of the extrinsic cell death
pathway. Gervais et al. (2002) proposed that huntingtin polyglutamine
expansion liberates HIP1 so that it can form a caspase-8 recruitment
complex with HIPPI, possibly contributing to neuronal death in
Huntington disease.

Yu et al. (2004) defined a novel molecular pathway in which activation
of the receptor-interacting protein (RIP; 603453), a serine-threonine
kinase, and Jun amino-terminal kinase (601158) induced cell death with
the morphology of autophagy. Autophagic death required the genes ATG7
(GSA7; 608760) and beclin-1 (604378) and was induced by caspase-8
inhibition. Yu et al. (2004) cautioned that clinical therapies involving
caspase inhibitors may arrest apoptosis but also have the unanticipated
effect of promoting autophagic cell death.

Poulaki et al. (2005) found that human retinoblastoma (RB1; 614041) cell
lines were resistant to death receptor (see DR5; 603612)-mediated
apoptosis because of a deficiency of CASP8 expression secondary to
epigenetic gene silencing by overmethylation. Treatment with a
demethylating agent restored CASP8 expression and sensitivity to
apoptosis.

Su et al. (2005) showed that caspase-8 deficiency (607271) in humans and
mice specifically abolishes activation of the transcription factor NF
kappa-B (164011) after stimulation through antigen receptors, Fc
receptors, or Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4; 603030) in T, B, and natural
killer cells. Caspase-8 also causes the alpha-beta complex of the
inhibitor of NF-kappa-B kinase (IKK; 600644 and 300248, respectively) to
associate with the upstream BCL10 (603517)-MALT1 (604860) adaptor
complex. Recruitment of the IKK-alpha,beta complex, its activation, and
the nuclear translocation of NF-kappa-B require enzyme activity of
full-length caspase-8. Su et al. (2005) concluded that their findings
explained the paradoxical association of defective apoptosis and
combined immunodeficiency in human caspase-8 deficiency.

Stupack et al. (2006) showed that suppression of caspase-8 expression
occurs during the establishment of neuroblastoma (256700) metastases in
vivo, and that reconstitution of caspase-8 expression in deficient
neuroblastoma cells suppressed their metastases. Caspase-8 status was
not a predictor of primary tumor growth; rather, caspase-8 selectively
potentiated apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells invading the collagenous
stroma at the tumor margin. Apoptosis was initiated by unligated
integrins (see 605025) by means of a process known as integrin-mediated
death. Loss of caspase-8 or integrin rendered the cells refractory to
integrin-mediated death, allowed cellular survival in the stromal
microenvironment, and promoted metastases. Stupack et al. (2006)
concluded that these findings define caspase-8 as a metastasis
suppressor gene that, together with integrins, regulates the survival
and invasive capacity of neuroblastoma cells.

Oberst et al. (2011) showed that development of caspase-8-deficient mice
is completely rescued by ablation of receptor-interacting protein
kinase-3 (RIPK3; 605817). Adult animals lacking both caspase-8 and Ripk3
displayed a progressive lymphoaccumulative disease resembling that seen
with defects in Cd95 (FAS; 134637) or Cd95 ligand (FASL; 134638), and
resisted the lethal effects of Cd95 ligation in vivo. Oberst et al.
(2011) found that caspase-8 prevents RIPK3-dependent necrosis without
inducing apoptosis by functioning in a proteolytically active complex
with CFLAR (603599) and that this complex is required for the protective
function.

Kaiser et al. (2011) found that Ripk3 is responsible for the
midgestational death of Casp8-deficient embryos. Remarkably,
Casp8-null/Rip3-null-double mutant mice were viable and matured into
fertile adults with a full immune complement of myeloid and lymphoid
cell types. These mice seemed immunocompetent but developed
lymphadenopathy by 4 months of age marked by accumulation of abnormal T
cells in the periphery, a phenotype reminiscent of mice with Fas
deficiency. Thus, Kaiser et al. (2011) concluded that Casp8 contributes
to homeostatic control in the adult immune system; however, RIPK3 and
CASP8 are together completely dispensable for mammalian development.

Burguillos et al. (2011) showed that the orderly activation of caspase-8
and caspase-3/7 (600636/601761), known executioners of apoptotic cell
death, regulate microglia activation through a protein kinase C-delta
(PPKCD; 176977)-dependent pathway. Burguillos et al. (2011) found that
stimulation of microglia with various inflammogens activates caspase-8
and caspase-3/7 in microglia without triggering cell death in vitro and
in vivo. Knockdown or chemical inhibition of each of these caspases
hindered microglia activation and consequently reduced neurotoxicity.
The authors observed that these caspases are activated in microglia in
the ventral mesencephalon of Parkinson disease (168600) and the frontal
cortex of individuals with Alzheimer disease (104300). Burguillos et al.
(2011) concluded that caspase-8 and caspase-3/7 are involved in
regulating microglia activation, and suggested that inhibition of these
caspases could be neuroprotective by targeting the microglia rather than
the neurons themselves.

Gunther et al. (2011) demonstrated a critical role for caspase-8 in
regulating necroptosis of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and
terminal ileitis. Mice with a conditional deletion of caspase-8 in the
intestinal epithelium (Casp8-delta-IEC) spontaneously developed
inflammatory lesions in the terminal ileum were highly susceptible to
colitis. These mice lacked Paneth cells and showed reduced numbers of
goblet cells, indicating dysregulated antimicrobial immune cell
functions of the intestinal epithelium. Casp8-delta-IEC mice showed
increased cell death in the Paneth cell area of small intestinal crypts.
Epithelial cell death was induced by tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFA;
191160), was associated with increased expression of
receptor-interacting protein-3 (RIP3; 605817) and could be inhibited on
blockade of necroptosis. Lastly, Gunther et al. (2011) identified high
levels of RIP3 in human Paneth cells and increased necroptosis in the
terminal ileum of patients with Crohn disease, suggesting a potential
role of necroptosis in the pathogenesis of this disease. Gunther et al.
(2011) concluded that their data demonstrated a critical function of
caspase-8 in regulating intestinal homeostasis and in protecting IECs
from TNFA-induced necroptotic cell death.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Varfolomeev et al. (1998) determined that
the CASP8 gene contains 8 exons. Hadano et al. (2001) determined that
the CASP8 gene contains 13 exons and spans 51.2 kb.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), Kischkel et al. (1998)
mapped the CASP8 gene to human chromosome 2q33-q34 and mouse chromosome
1B-proximal C. This mapping further extended the known homology of
synteny between these regions of human chromosome 2 and mouse chromosome
1. By FISH, Grenet et al. (1999) also mapped the CASP8 gene to 2q33-q34.
They noted that CASP10 (601762), whose product is closely related to
that of CASP8, has been mapped to the same location, indicating that the
2 genes have evolved by tandem duplication.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Liu et al. (2002) identified a naturally occurring deletion of leu62
within the first DED of CASP8 in A431 human vulva squamous carcinoma
cells. This deletion resulted in defective CASP8-dependent apoptosis.
Unlike wildtype CASP8, CASP8 lacking leu62 failed to form oligomers with
wildtype CASP8 and failed to interact with FADD. The mutation did not
effect proteolytic activation by granzyme B, nor did it effect catalytic
activity against PARP.

In 2 affected sibs from a consanguineous family with caspase-8
deficiency (607271), Chun et al. (2002) identified a homozygous mutation
in the CASP8 gene (601763.0001). The patients had defects in the
activation of T and B lymphocytes and natural killer cells, which led to
immunodeficiency.

Soung et al. (2005) analyzed the entire coding region of the CASP8 gene
in 69 hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC; 114550), 2 with low-grade
dysplastic nodule (LGDN), 2 with high-grade dysplastic nodule (HGDN),
and 65 without dysplastic nodules, and detected a total of 9 somatic
mutations (13%). All 9 mutations were an identical 2-bp deletion
(nucleotides 1225-1226; 601763.0002), which was predicted to result in
frameshift and premature termination of amino acid synthesis in the p10
protease subunit. The change was detected both in HCC and in LGDN
lesions, suggesting that CASP8 mutation may be involved in the early
stage of HCC carcinogenesis. Soung et al. (2005) found that expression
of the tumor-derived caspase-8 mutant in cells abolished cell death
activity of caspase-8.

Cox et al. (2007) reported the findings of the Breast Cancer Association
Consortium (BCAC), which had been established to conduct combined
case-control analyses with augmented statistical power to try to confirm
putative genetic associations with breast cancer. They genotyped 9 SNPs
for which there was some prior evidence of an association with breast
cancer (114480). They included data from 9 to 15 studies, comprising
11,391 to 18,290 cases and 14,753 to 22,670 controls. They found
evidence of a protective association with breast cancer for a D302H
polymorphism in CASP8 (601763.0003), and weaker evidence for an L10P SNP
in the TGFB1 gene (190180.0007). These results demonstrated that common
breast cancer susceptibility alleles with small effects on risk can be
identified, given sufficiently powerful studies.

Caspases are important in the life and death of immune cells and
therefore influence immune surveillance of malignancies. Sun et al.
(2007) tested whether genetic variants in CASP8, CASP10, (601762), and
CFLAR (603599), 3 genes important for death receptor-induced cell
killing residing in tandem order on chromosome 2q33, are associated with
cancer susceptibility. Using a haplotype-tagging SNP approach, they
identified a 6-nucleotide deletion (-652 6N del) variant in the CASP8
promoter (601763.0004) associated with decreased risk of lung cancer.
The deletion destroyed a binding site for stimulatory protein-1 (SP1;
189906) and decreased transcription. Biochemical analyses showed that T
lymphocytes with the deletion variant had lower caspase-8 activity and
activation-induced cell death upon stimulation with cancer cell
antigens. Case-control analyses of 4,995 individuals with cancer and
4,972 controls in a Chinese population showed that this genetic variant
is associated with reduced susceptibility to multiple cancers, including
lung, esophageal, gastric, colorectal, cervical, and breast cancers,
acting in an allele dose-dependent manner. The results supported the
hypothesis that genetic variants influencing immune status modify cancer
susceptibility. Haiman et al. (2008) did not find an association between
this SNP and breast (114480), colorectal (114500), or prostate (176807)
cancer among 2,098, 1,139, and 2,825 patients, respectively. The study
included patients in Hawaii and California of various ethnic groups.

ANIMAL MODEL

Varfolomeev et al. (1998) generated mice deficient in Casp8 by
disrupting exons 1 and 2, which encode the N-terminal death effector
domains (DEDs) that interact with MORT1/FADD. Whereas wildtype and
heterozygous mice appeared normal, no homozygous mutant mice survived
beyond approximately embryonic day 13.5. Histopathologic analysis
revealed marked abdominal hyperemia with erythrocytosis in the liver,
major blood vessels, capillaries, and other organs. Cardiac ventricular
musculature was thin and similar to early mesenchyme. Colony forming
assays showed that hemopoietic precursor cells were markedly reduced in
the mutant mice. Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis indicated
that fibroblasts from mutant mice responded normally to the noncytocidal
effects of tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR; 191190) and death
receptor-3 (DR3, or TNFRSF12; 603366) stimulation, whereas wildtype
fibroblasts were killed by TNF (191160) treatment or FAS cross-linking.
Agents such as ultraviolet irradiation and protein kinase inhibitors
were lethal for mutant and normal fibroblasts. Varfolomeev et al. (1998)
concluded that CASP8 is necessary for death induction by receptors of
the TNF/nerve growth factor (see NGFR; 162010) family and is vital in
embryonal development.

Zender et al. (2003) evaluated the efficacy of small interfering RNA
(siRNA) in vivo in different mouse models with acute liver failure. They
directed 21-nucleotide siRNAs against caspase-8, which is a key enzyme
in death receptor-mediated apoptosis. Systemic administration of
caspase-8 siRNA resulted in inhibition of caspase-8 gene expression in
the liver, therefore preventing CD95-mediated apoptosis. Protection of
hepatocytes by caspase-8 siRNA significantly attenuated acute liver
damage induced by CD95 antibody or by adenovirus expressing FAS ligand.
In a clinical situation, siRNAs would most likely be administered after
the onset of acute liver failure. Therefore, Zender et al. (2003)
injected caspase-8 siRNA at a time during experimentally-induced liver
failure with already elevated liver transaminases. Improvement of
survival due to RNA interference was significant even when caspase-8
siRNA was applied during ongoing acute liver failure.

Salmena and Hakem (2005) used the Cre/lox recombinase system to generate
mice lacking Casp8 only in T cells (Tcasp8 -/- mice). Tcasp8 -/- mice
developed an age-dependent lethal lymphoproliferative and
lymphoinfiltrative immune disorder characterized by lymphoadenopathy,
splenomegaly, and T-cell infiltrates in lung, liver, and kidney.
Although there was lymphopenia in young Tcasp8 -/- mice, peripheral T
cells in old Tcasp8 -/- mice proliferated in the absence of infection or
stimulation. Salmena and Hakem (2005) proposed that Tcasp8 -/- mice may
serve as a model of human CASP8 deficiency and that CASP8 in T cells is
required for lymphocyte homeostasis.

To define the contribution of reduced caspase-8 to a wound healing
response, Lee et al. (2009) generated an epidermal knockout of
caspase-8. By postnatal day 10 the conditional knockout mouse had flaky
skin throughout its body, was slightly runted, and its epidermis was
dramatically thickened. Lee et al. (2009) found that even though
caspase-8 is normally expressed in the granular layer, it was the basal
and spinous layers that were markedly expanded in the knockout
epidermis. Lee et al. (2009) demonstrated that the loss of epidermal
caspase-8, an important mediator of apoptosis, recapitulated several
phases of a wound healing response in the mouse. The epidermal
hyperplasia in the caspase-8 null skin is the culmination of signals
exchanged between epidermal keratinocytes, dermal fibroblasts, and
leukocytic cells. This reciprocal interaction is initiated by the
paracrine signaling of interleukin 1-alpha (IL1-alpha; 147760), which
activates both skin stem cell proliferation and cutaneous inflammation.
The noncanonical secretion of IL1-alpha is induced by a p38-MAPK
(600289)-mediated upregulation of NALP3 (606416), leading to
inflammasome assembly and caspase-1 activation. Notably, the increased
proliferation of basal keratinocytes is counterbalanced by the growth
arrest of suprabasal keratinocytes in the stratified epidermis by
IL1-alpha-dependent NF-kappa-B (see 164011) signaling. Lee et al. (2009)
concluded that their findings illustrated how the loss of caspase-8 can
affect more than programmed cell death to alter the local
microenvironment and elicit processes common to wound repair and many
neoplastic skin disorders.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CASPASE 8 DEFICIENCY
CASP8, ARG248TRP

In 2 affected sibs from a consanguineous family with caspase-8
deficiency (607271), Chun et al. (2002) identified a homozygous C-to-T
transition in the CASP8 gene, resulting in an arg248-to-trp (R248W)
substitution within the p18 protease subunit of the protein. The
asymptomatic mother, father, and sister were heterozygous carriers of
the mutation. In 13 extended family members, Chun et al. (2002)
identified 7 asymptomatic heterozygous carriers but found no additional
homozygous or immunodeficient individuals.

.0002
HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA, SOMATIC
CASP8, 2-BP DEL, 1225TG

In 9 unrelated patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (114550) and HBV
infection, Soung et al. (2005) identified the same somatic mutation, a
2-bp deletion (1225_1226delTG) in exon 7 that was predicted to result in
frameshift and premature termination of amino acid synthesis in the p10
protease subunit.

.0003
BREAST CANCER, PROTECTION AGAINST
CASP8, ASP302HIS

MacPherson et al. (2004) and Frank et al. (2005) found evidence that the
presence of a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the CASP8 gene
resulting in an asp302-to-his (D302H) substitution (dbSNP rs1045485)
could reduce susceptibility to breast cancer (114480) in British and
German cohorts, respectively. Cox et al. (2007) found evidence for a
protective effect of the D302H polymorphism in an allele dose-dependent
manner in 16,423 cases and 17,109 controls from 14 studies that
contributed data to the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC). The
study achieved odds ratios of 0.89 and 0.74 for heterozygotes and rare
homozygotes, respectively, compared with common homozygotes. This site
was not found to be polymorphic in Korean, Han Chinese, or Japanese
women. Cox et al. (2007) noted that the functional consequences of the
aspartic acid-to-histidine substitution were not known, and further
experiments were required to establish whether D302H itself or another
variant in strong linkage disequilibrium with it is causative.

.0004
LUNG CANCER, PROTECTION AGAINST
CASP8, 6-BP DEL, NT-652

Sun et al. (2007) identified a 6-nucleotide insertion/deletion
polymorphism in the CASP8 promoter, -652 AGTAAG ins/del (dbSNP
rs3834129), the deletion variant of which was associated with decreased
risk of developing lung cancer (211980) in a population of Han Chinese
subjects. The -652 6N deletion was also associated with decreased risk
of cancer of various other forms including esophageal, gastric,
colorectal, cervical, and breast, acting in an allele dose-dependent
manner. The frequency of the -652 6N deletion was significantly lower in
individuals with lung cancer (P = 4.1 x 10(-5)).

Haiman et al. (2008) did not find an association between this SNP and
breast (114480), colorectal (114500), or prostate (176807) cancer among
2,098, 1,139, and 2,825 patients, respectively. The study included
patients in Hawaii and California of various ethnic groups.

605328	TITLE *605328 KRUPPEL-LIKE FACTOR 13; KLF13
;;RANTES FACTOR OF LATE-ACTIVATED T LYMPHOCYTES 1; RFLAT1;;
FKLF2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

KLF13 belongs to a family of transcription factors that contain 3
classical zinc finger DNA-binding domains consisting of a zinc atom
tetrahedrally coordinated by 2 cysteines and 2 histidines (C2H2 motif).
These transcription factors bind to GC-rich sequences and related GT and
CACCC boxes (Scohy et al., 2000).

CLONING

Although many genes are induced early after T-cell activation, a few,
like RANTES (187011), are induced at the T-cell differentiation stage.
The A promoter region of the RANTES gene binds REL (e.g., RELA, 164014)
as well as non-REL proteins. Using Southwestern blotting of nuclear
extracts of activated peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) probed with
oligonucleotides from the RANTES promoter A and B sites, Song et al.
(1999) identified proteins detected only at late activation stages. By
screening a day 5 activated PBL library with a 3-tandem A site probe,
Song et al. (1999) obtained a cDNA encoding the KLF13 protein, which
they termed RFLAT (RANTES factor of late-activated T lymphocytes). The
deduced 228-amino acid protein contains 3 contiguous TFIIIA (GTF3A;
600860)-like C-terminal DNA-binding zinc finger motifs, which are 65 to
73% homologous to SP1 (189906), SP3 (601804), and BTEB (602902). Its N
terminus, which is preceded by a stretch rich in basic amino acids, is
rich in proline, serine, and alanine residues. SDS-PAGE and Western blot
analysis indicated that KLF13 is expressed as a phosphorylated 38-kD
protein. Northern blot analysis revealed ubiquitous expression of 7.5-
and 5.0-kb transcripts, with greatest abundance in PBL and thymus.
Immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis showed that KLF13 is
localized in the nucleus.

Using degenerate PCR primers based on the sequence for KLF1 (600599),
Asano et al. (2000) cloned a cDNA from fetal liver erythroid cells that
encodes KLF13, which they termed FKLF2 based on its structural
similarity to FKLF (TIEG2; 603301). By Northern blot analysis, they
showed that KLF13 was expressed as 4.4- and 1.5-kb transcripts in the
bone marrow and striated muscles but not in 12 other human tissues
analyzed.

By searching for sequences related to the zinc finger DNA-binding domain
of SP1, followed by screening a fetal mouse liver cDNA library, Scohy et
al. (2000) cloned mouse Klf13. Like the human protein, mouse Klf13
encodes a deduced 288-amino acid protein. Mouse and human KLF13 share
98% amino acid identity through the zinc finger domains and 87% identity
overall. Residues within each of the 3 zinc fingers that establish
specific contacts with DNA are completely conserved in KLF13, suggesting
that both mouse and human KLF13 recognize a classical GC box. Klf13 also
contains an N-terminal region rich in proline and alanine. RT-PCR
analysis revealed Klf13 expression in all mouse tissues examined, with
lowest levels in testis and liver.

GENE FUNCTION

Gelshift binding analysis by Song et al. (1999) demonstrated that KLF13
binds to the A and A/B RANTES promoter binding sites, but not the B site
alone, and that NFKB (164011) also binds to these sites. Northern and
Western blot analysis demonstrated that while KLF13 mRNA is detectable
at constant steady state levels in resting and activated T cells, KLF13
protein appears only late after activation. Luciferase reporter assays
showed that KLF13 can transactivate the RANTES gene; whereas KLF13 is
the dominant transactivator of RANTES in T-cells, RELA is the dominant
transactivator in fibroblasts.

Luciferase reporter assays by Asano et al. (2000) showed that KLF13
activates predominantly the gamma- (HBG1; 142200) and, to a lesser
degree, the epsilon- (HBE1; 142100) and beta- (HBB; 141900) globin gene
promoters. They found that KLF13 is involved in activation of
transcription of a wide variety of genes in the cells of erythroid
lineage, including GATA1 (305371), glycophorin B (111740),
ferrochelatase (612386), porphobilinogen deaminase (HMBS; 609806), and
5-aminolevulinate synthase (125290).

MAPPING

Scott (2000) mapped the KLF13 gene to chromosome 15 based on sequence
similarity between the KLF13 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF150628) and a
chromosome 15 clone (GenBank GENBANK AC009873). By somatic cell hybrid
analysis, Scohy et al. (2000) mapped the KLF13 gene to chromosome 15.
Suske et al. (2005) stated that the human KLF13 gene maps to chromosome
15q13.2, and the mouse Klf13 gene to chromosome 7C.

177046	TITLE *177046 PROTEASOME SUBUNIT, BETA-TYPE, 8; PSMB8
;;LARGE MULTIFUNCTIONAL PROTEASE 7; LMP7;;
PROTEASOME-RELATED GENE 7;;
RING10;;
PROTEASOME SUBUNIT BETA-5I
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The immunoproteasome, a distinct class of proteasome found predominantly
in monocytes and lymphocytes, shapes the antigenic repertoire presented
on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. PSMB8
encodes the chymotrypsin-like catalytic subunit of the immunoproteasome
(Muchamuel et al., 2009).

GENE STRUCTURE

Agarwal et al. (2010) noted that the PSMB8 gene contains 6 exons with
alternative splicing of exons 1A and 1B.

MAPPING

Antigen processing involves the generation of peptides from cytosolic
proteins and their transport into the endoplasmic reticulum, where they
associate with MHC class I molecules. Two genes have been identified in
the MHC class II region, TAP1 (170260) and TAP2 (170261), that are
thought to encode the peptide transport proteins. Glynne et al. (1991)
reported a proteasome-related sequence, RING10, mapping between the
transporter genes on chromosome 6p21.3.

GENE FUNCTION

Muchamuel et al. (2009) showed that PR-957, a selective inhibitor of
LMP7, blocked presentation of MHC class I-restricted antigens in vitro
and in vivo. PR-957 also blocked production of IL23 (see 605580) by
activated monocytes and IL2 (147680) and IFNG (147570) by T cells. In
mouse models, PR-957 reversed signs of rheumatoid arthritis (RA; 180300)
and cellular infiltration, cytokine production, and autoantibody levels.
Muchamuel et al. (2009) concluded that LMP7 has a role in controlling
pathogenic immune responses and may be a target in autoimmune disorders.

Incorporation of the proteasome beta subunits into the maturing
proteasome frequently requires proteolytic removal of a prosequence by
proteolytically active subunits. By following the incorporation of
mutant human LMP7 into the 20S proteasome, Witt et al. (2000) showed
that the LMP7 prosequence was not essential for incorporation of LMP7
into the maturing proteasome, but it increased the efficiency of LMP7
incorporation and proteasome maturation.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Deng et al. (1995) found evidence suggesting that LMP genes have effects
on susceptibility to insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM; 222100),
independent of HLA-DR and HLA-DQ. A genomic polymorphism of LMP7 was
found to be strongly associated with IDDM, and the arg/his-60
polymorphism in LMP2 (309060) was found to be associated with IDDM in
subjects containing an HLA-DR4-DQB1*0302 haplotype.

By genomewide homozygosity mapping followed by candidate gene sequencing
of the 3 patients with autoinflammatory, lipodystrophy, and dermatosis
syndrome (ALDD; 256040) reported by Garg et al. (2010), Agarwal et al.
(2010) identified the same homozygous mutation in the PSMB8 gene (T75M;
177046.0001).

Kitamura et al. (2011) identified a homozygous PSMB8 mutation (G197V;
177046.0002) in 3 Japanese patients from 2 consanguineous families with
the Nakajo-Nishimura autoinflammatory syndrome. One of the families had
previously been reported by Tanaka et al. (1993). The mutation increased
assembly intermediates of immunoproteasomes, resulting in decreased
proteasome function and ubiquitin-coupled protein accumulation in
patient tissues. In addition, IL6 (147620) was highly expressed and
there was reduced expression of PSMB8. In vitro studies showed that
downregulation of PSMB8 inhibited the differentiation of murine and
human adipocytes in vitro, and injection of siRNA against Psmb8 in mouse
skin reduced adipocyte tissue volume. The findings identified PSMB8 as
an essential component and regulator of inflammation and of adipocyte
differentiation, suggesting that immunoproteasomes have pleiotropic
functions in maintaining the homeostasis of a variety of cell types.

In 5 patients with an autoinflammatory disorder previously designated
CANDLE syndrome for 'chronic atypical neutrophilic dermatosis with
lipodystrophy and elevated temperature' (Torrelo et al., 2010), Liu et
al. (2012) identified homozygous mutations in the PSMB8 gene
(177046.0001 and 177046.0004). Two additional patients were heterozygous
for a PSMB8 mutation, but a second pathogenic mutation could not be
found. The patients had high levels of gamma-interferon-induced
protein-10 (CXCL10; 147310), as well as other inflammatory markers.
Microarray profiling suggested dysregulation of the interferon signaling
pathway, particularly gamma-interferon.

ANIMAL MODEL

Fehling et al. (1994) found that mice with a targeted deletion of the
Lmp7 gene had reduced levels of MHC class I cell-surface expression and
presented an endogenous antigen inefficiently.

NOMENCLATURE

The original designation for this gene, RING10, is an acronym for
'really interesting new gene.' The 'D number' of this expressed sequence
was D6S216E.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
AUTOINFLAMMATION, LIPODYSTROPHY, AND DERMATOSIS SYNDROME
PSMB8, THR75MET

In 3 affected members from 2 unrelated families with an autoinflammatory
disorder termed 'joint contractures, muscle atrophy, microcytic anemia,
and panniculitis-induced lipodystrophy' (256040), Agarwal et al. (2010)
identified a homozygous 224C-T transition in exon 2 of the PSMB8 gene,
resulting in a thr75-to-met (T75M) substitution in a highly conserved
residue. The mutation was not found in 275 controls but was present in
heterozygosity in available parents and unaffected sibs. The patients
had previously been reported by Garg et al. (2010) and were of
Portuguese and Mexican origin, respectively. The parents of the
Portuguese patients were consanguineous, whereas consanguinity was
suspected in the parents of the Mexican patients. Haplotype analysis
indicated identity by descent, but the mutation appeared to be ancient.
Molecular dynamics simulation indicated that the mutation relaxed the
protein structure by 1.2 angstrom, and may affect the proteolytic
processing of peptides. Studies of patient lymphocytes showed that the
mutant protein had markedly decreased chymotrypsin-like activity
compared to wildtype, consistent with a decrease in proteasomal activity
and loss of function. Laboratory studies of the 2 Mexican sibs performed
by Agarwal et al. (2010) showed that both had significantly increased
levels of serum IL6 (147620) and gamma-interferon (IFNG; 147570), and 1
had increased IL8 (146930). Other cytokines were not elevated,
suggesting a particular biomarker signature. The disorder is
characterized by childhood onset of joint stiffness and severe
contractures of the hands and feet, erythematous skin lesions with
subsequent development of severe lipodystrophy, and laboratory evidence
of immune dysregulation. Accompanying features include muscle weakness
and atrophy, hepatosplenomegaly, and microcytic anemia. The findings
indicated that dysfunction of the immunoproteasome can result in an
autoinflammatory disease.

Liu et al. (2012) identified a homozygous T75M mutation in 4 unrelated
patients with an autoinflammatory disorder previously designated CANDLE
syndrome for 'chronic atypical neutrophilic dermatosis with
lipodystrophy and elevated temperature' (Torrelo et al., 2010). The
clinical features were similar to those reported by Garg et al. (2010).
Two patients reported by Liu et al. (2012) were of Hispanic origin and 2
were of Spanish origin. However, only 2 patients shared the same
haplotype, suggesting that this is a mutational hotspot. Two additional
patients reported by Liu et al. (2012) were heterozygous for the T75M
mutation, but a second mutation was not detected.

.0002
AUTOINFLAMMATION, LIPODYSTROPHY, AND DERMATOSIS SYNDROME
PSMB8, GLY197VAL

In 3 Japanese patients from 2 consanguineous families with an
autoinflammatory disorder termed 'Nakajo-Nishimura syndrome' (256040),
Kitamura et al. (2011) identified a homozygous G-to-T transversion in
the PSMB8 gene, resulting in a gly197-to-val (G197V) substitution in a
conserved surface-exposed position in a beta-hairpin turn; the affected
residue is G201V in the other isoform of the protein. The mutation was
not found in 624 control alleles. Patient B cells showed decreased
levels of the mature protein and increased proportion of
immunoproteasome intermediates, as well as decreased proteasome
activity, and patient skin cells showed accumulated ubiquitinated
proteins. IL6 (147620) expression was increased in patient tissues. One
of the families had previously been reported by Tanaka et al. (1993).

AUTOINFLAMMATION, LIPODYSTROPHY, AND DERMATOSIS SYNDROME
PSMB8, GLY201VAL

In 5 unrelated Japanese patients with an autoinflammatory disorder
termed 'Nakajo-Nishimura syndrome' (256040), Arima et al. (2011)
identified a homozygous 602G-T transversion in exon 5 of the PSMB8 gene,
resulting in a gly201-to-val (G201V) substitution in a highly conserved
residue. Haplotype analysis indicated a founder effect. The mutation is
located at the edge of the S8 beta-sheet of the protein, close to the
catalytic residue thr73, and was predicted to cause conformational
changes of catalytic residues thr73 and lys105 as well as affecting the
interface of the protein with other proteasome subunits. Patient-derived
lymphoblastoid cell lines showed markedly decreased chymotrypsin-like
activity compared to controls. Trypsin-like and caspase-like activity
were also decreased. Western blot analysis showed reduced levels of the
20S proteasome, consistent with an assembly defect. Patient cells showed
decreased proteolytic activity with an accumulation of ubiquitinated and
oxidized proteins, and patient skin biopsies showed activation of an
inflammatory response. Patient sera showed increased IL6 (147620) and
IL10 (124092) associated with increased intracellular phosphorylated p38
(MAPK14; 600289), which may be related to increased inflammation. The
findings suggested that decreased proteasome activity can affect signal
transduction and promote inflammation.

AUTOINFLAMMATION, LIPODYSTROPHY, AND DERMATOSIS SYNDROME
PSMB8, CYS135TER

In a 12.5-year-old Ashkenazi Jewish boy with an autoinflammatory
disorder characterized by chronic atypical neutrophilic dermatosis with
lipodystrophy and elevated temperature (256040), Liu et al. (2012)
identified a homozygous 405C-A transversion in exon 3 of the PSMB8 gene,
resulting in a cys135-to-ter (C135X) substitution, leading to a large
deletion of the terminal 141 residues. The mutant protein was predicted
to interfere with proper assembly of the proteasome. The patient
presented at 1 month of age with fever and skin lesions. He later
developed annular plaques, recurrent fevers, lipodystrophy,
hepatomegaly, arthritis/arthralgia, violaceous eyelids, microcytic
anemia, and elevated liver enzymes.

126063	TITLE *126063 DIHYDROLIPOAMIDE S-SUCCINYLTRANSFERASE; DLST
;;ALPHA-KETOGLUTARATE DEHYDROGENASE COMPLEX, E2 COMPONENT OF
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complexes (pyruvate dehydrogenase
complex, alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex, and branched chain
alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex) are a family of multienzyme
complexes. They are localized in mitochondria and catalyze the oxidative
decarboxylation of alpha-keto acids. These 3 alpha-keto acid
dehydrogenase complexes are composed of 3 different enzymes: alpha-keto
acid dehydrogenase (E1; 300502), dihydrolipoamide acyltransferase (E2),
and dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (E3; 238331). Dihydrolipoamide
succinyltransferase, which is a component of the structural core of the
alpha-keto glutarate dehydrogenase complex, was studied by Nakano et al.
(1993), who isolated a cDNA from a human fibroblast cDNA library. Amino
acid sequence analysis supported their previous observation (Nakano et
al., 1993) that human dihydrolipoamide succinyltransferase lacks a
sequence motif for an E1 and/or E3 binding site. By Northern blot
analysis, Ali et al. (1994) detected ubiquitous expression of DLST in
peripheral tissues and brain.

GENE STRUCTURE

Nakano et al. (1993) found that the DLST gene contains 3 exons and 4
introns and that the nucleotide sequence at the 5-prime donor and
3-prime acceptor sites of all introns conformed to the gt-ag rule.

GENE FUNCTION

DLST is the E2 component of the alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase
complex. In contrast to the E2 components of the other 2 alpha-keto acid
dehydrogenase complexes, the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (see 300502)
and the branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex (see
608348), the alpha-KGDC E2 has a unique structure consisting of 2
domains and lacking a sequence motif of an E3 and/or E1 binding site
(Patel and Harris, 1995).

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Nakano et al. (1993) found that
the DLST gene is located on 14q24.2-q24.3 and that a related sequence is
located on 1p31. The gene for the dihydrolipoamide acyltransferase of
the branched chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex (DBT; 248610),
the site of the mutation in type 2 maple syrup urine disease (see
248600), is located on 1p31. Nakano et al. (1993) mentioned the
possibility that mutation of the DLST gene may be a cause of familial
Alzheimer disease that maps to 14q24.3 (AD3; 607822). Ali et al. (1994)
mapped the DLST gene (symbolized by them KGDHC) to 14q24.3 by isotopic
in situ hybridization. The cDNA they used also cross-hybridized to an
apparent E2k pseudogene on 1p31.

606032	TITLE *606032 SERINE/ARGININE REPETITIVE MATRIX PROTEIN 2; SRRM2
;;SERINE/ARGININE-RICH SPLICING FACTOR-RELATED NUCLEAR MATRIX PROTEIN,
300-KD;;
SR-RELATED NUCLEAR MATRIX PROTEIN, 300-KD; SRM300;;
SRL300
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The 300-kD nuclear matrix antigen SRM300 forms a complex with the 160-kD
serine/arginine (SR)-related nuclear matrix protein SRM160 (605975)
known as the SRM160/300 splicing coactivator. This complex functions in
splicing by promoting critical interactions between splicing factors
bound to pre-mRNA, including snRNPs and SR family proteins (summary by
Blencowe et al., 2000).

CLONING

By biochemical purification, micropeptide sequence analysis, EST
database searching, and screening a monocytoid cDNA library, Blencowe et
al. (2000) isolated a cDNA encoding SRM300. Like SRM160, the deduced
2,296-amino acid SRM300 protein is rich in serine (S), arginine (R), and
proline (P), has numerous SR dipeptides and 2 long polyserine domains,
and lacks an RNA recognition domain. A portion of the SRM300 protein is
identical to a partial protein, KIAA0324, identified by Nagase et al.
(1997). By RT-PCR analysis, Nagase et al. (1997) detected ubiquitous
expression of KIAA0324. Using immunoblot and immunoprecipitation
analyses and confocal microscopy, Blencowe et al. (2000) confirmed that
SRM300 associates with SRM160 and pre-mRNA and is localized in nuclear
speckles. Reconstitution of SRM160/SRM300-depleted splicing reactions
with recombinant SRM160 restored splicing activity, suggesting that
SRM160 is the more important component of the complex.

By screening a cDNA library for RNA ligands, Sawada et al. (2000)
identified a cDNA encoding SRM300, which they termed SRL300. The deduced
2,752-amino acid protein has multiple R, S, and P residues, numerous
phosphorylation sites, and a predicted molecular mass of 300 kD,
suggesting that it may be the full-length protein. Immunoblot analysis
detected GST fusion proteins of greater than 300 kD in human and rat
cells. Northern blot analysis revealed expression of a 9.0- to 10.0-kb
SRL300 transcript in all tissues and cell lines tested.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1997) mapped the SRM300
gene, or KIAA0324, to chromosome 16. By genomic sequence analysis,
Blencowe et al. (2000) mapped the SRM300 gene to chromosome 16.

138610	TITLE *138610 OROSOMUCOID 2; ORM2
;;GLYCOPROTEIN, ALPHA-1-ACID, OF SERUM, TYPE 2;;
ALPHA-1-ACID GLYCOPROTEIN, TYPE 2; AGP2
DESCRIPTION Yuasa et al. (1986) performed orosomucoid phenotyping by isoelectric
focusing and immunoprinting. The band pattern of desialyzed ORM
indicated to these workers that the ORM system is controlled by 2
structural loci, ORM1 (138600) and ORM2. Whereas the ORM1 locus was
polymorphic, the ORM2 locus appeared to be monomorphic. Later, however,
Yuasa et al. (1987) demonstrated polymorphism of the ORM2 locus, with 6
alleles in the Japanese population. By studies of orosomucoid cDNA
clones isolated from mouse liver, Cooper and Papaconstantinou (1986)
showed that 2 species of ORM mRNA are transcribed from 2 distinct genes.
Escallon et al. (1987) presented evidence for the expression of a second
structural locus (ORM2) in human plasma as well as for the detection of
genetically determined variation at the ORM2 locus in American blacks by
the use of a sensitive enzyme-linked immunoblotting technique. After
thin-layer polyacrylamide isoelectric focusing (IEF) in gels containing
6 M urea, the isoprotein species coded by the second locus did not
segregate with the predominant alleles at the ORM1 locus. Variation in
ORM2 was not observed in U.S. whites or in several other populations
studied. Because of the low frequency and unlimited distribution of ORM2
variation, Escallon et al. (1987) were unable to test for linkage
between the 2 ORM loci.

By in situ hybridization using a cDNA clone for AGP2, Webb et al. (1988)
mapped both alpha-1-acid glycoprotein genes in the 9q34 band. Yuasa et
al. (1988) used a modified isoelectric focusing, in which glycerine was
omitted from gels, to differentiate ORM1 and ORM2 variants. They
demonstrated linkage disequilibrium between alleles at the 2 loci, thus
corroborating the close linkage demonstrated physically by Dente et al.
(1987). Merritt and Board (1988) presented the complete nucleotide
sequence of the ORM2 gene, which is located approximately 3.3 kb
downstream from ORM1. The derived amino acid sequence indicated at least
21 amino acid differences between the products of the 2 genes.

Data on gene frequencies of allelic variants were tabulated by
Roychoudhury and Nei (1988).

;;CYTOSOLIC Fe-S CLUSTER DEFICIENT 1, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; CFD1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

NUBP2 is a member of the NUBP/MRP gene subfamily of ATP-binding proteins
(see NUBP1; 600280) (Nakashima et al., 1999).

CLONING

Nakashima et al. (1999) cloned mouse Nubp2 and used the murine sequence
as a probe in EST database analysis, followed by screening a human
teratoma cDNA library to clone full-length human NUBP2. The 271-amino
acid human NUBP2 protein shares 72.6% amino acid similarity with mouse
Nubp2. Northern blot analysis detected a 1.4-kb NUBP2 transcript with
ubiquitous expression in all human adult and fetal tissues tested, with
highest expression in adult skeletal muscle. NUBP2 contains conserved an
ATP/GTP binding motif A (P-loop), an ATP/GTP binding motif A-prime, and
NUBP/MRP alpha and beta motifs. NUBP2 lacks an additional N-terminal
sequence with 4 cysteine residues that is present in NUBP1.

GENE FUNCTION

Roy et al. (2003) showed that yeast Cfd1 was required for cytosolic Fe-S
cluster biogenesis and conversion of mammalian IRP1 (ACO1; 100880) to
cytosolic aconitase in yeast.

Stehling et al. (2008) found that NBP35 (NUBP1) interacted with
coexpressed CFD1 in transfected HeLa cells, suggesting that, like NBP35,
CFD1 may function in the regulation of cellular iron homeostasis and
cytosolic Fe-S protein assembly.

MAPPING

Hartz (2012) mapped the NUBP2 gene to chromosome 16p13.3 based on an
alignment of the NUBP2 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF118394) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

Nakashima et al. (1999) mapped the mouse Nubp2 gene to the t-complex
region of chromosome 17, which shows homology of synteny to human
chromosome 16p13.3.

600242	TITLE *600242 CHEMOKINE, CC MOTIF, RECEPTOR 7; CCR7
;;EPSTEIN-BARR VIRUS-INDUCED GENE 1; EBI1;;
CMKBR7
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using PCR with degenerate oligonucleotides, Schweickart et al. (1994)
identified a lymphoid-specific member of the G protein-coupled receptor
family. They showed that this receptor had been independently identified
by Birkenbach et al. (1993) as the Epstein-Barr-induced cDNA (symbol
EBI1). EBI1 is expressed in normal lymphoid tissues and in several B-
and T-lymphocyte cell lines. While the function and the ligand for EBI1
remains unknown, its sequence and gene structure suggest that it is
related to receptors that recognize chemoattractants, such as
interleukin-8 (146928), RANTES (187011), C5a, and fMet-Leu-Phe. Like the
chemoattractant receptors, EBI1 contains intervening sequences near its
5-prime end; however, EBI1 is unique in that both of its introns
interrupt the coding region of the first extracellular domain.
Schweickart et al. (1994) isolated the mouse Ebi1 cDNA and found that it
encodes a protein with 86% identity to the human homolog. Yoshida et al.
(1997) cloned a novel chemokine, a highly specific ligand for EBI1, that
they termed 'EBI1-ligand chemokine,' or ELC (602227).

GENE FUNCTION

Subsets of murine CD4+ T cells localize to different areas of the spleen
after adoptive transfer. Naive and T helper-1 (TH1) cells, which express
CCR7, home to the periarteriolar lymphoid sheath, whereas activated TH2
cells, which lack CCR7, form rings at the periphery of the T-cell zones
near B-cell follicles. Randolph et al. (1999) found that retroviral
transduction of TH2 cells with CCR7 forced them to localize in a
TH1-like pattern and inhibited their participation in B-cell help in
vivo but not in vitro. Randolph et al. (1999) concluded that
differential expression of chemokine receptors results in unique
cellular migration patterns that are important for effective immune
responses.

Sallusto et al. (1999) demonstrated that expression of CCR7 divides
human memory T cells into 2 functionally distinct subsets. CCR7- memory
cells express receptors for migration to inflamed tissues and display
immediate effector function. In contrast, CCR7+ memory cells express
lymph node homing receptors and lack immediate effector function, but
efficiently stimulate dendritic cells and differentiate into CCR7-
effector cells upon secondary stimulation. The CCR7+ and CCR7- T cells,
which Sallusto et al. (1999) named central memory (T-CM) and effector
memory (T-EM), differentiate in a step-wise fashion from naive T cells,
persist for years after immunization, and allow a division of labor in
the memory response.

For information on the role of CD45 expression in T lymphocytes, see
entry 151460. Champagne et al. (2001) evaluated CCR7 expression in
memory CD8+ T lymphocyte responses to HIV and to cytomegalovirus (CMV)
tetramers. Most memory T lymphocytes express CD45RO, but a fraction
express instead the CD45RA marker. Flow cytometric analyses of marker
expression and cell division identified 4 subsets of HIV- and
CMV-specific CD8+ T cells, representing a lineage differentiation
pattern: CD45RA+CCR7+ (double-positive); CD45RA-CCR7+; CD45RA-CCR7-
(double-negative); CD45RA+CCR7-. The capacity for cell division, as
measured by 5-(and 6-)carboxyl-fluorescein diacetate, succinimidyl
ester, and intracellular staining for the Ki67 nuclear antigen (176741),
is largely confined to the CCR7+ subsets and occurred more rapidly in
cells that are also CD45RA+. Although the double-negative cells did not
divide or expand after stimulation, they did revert to positivity for
either CD45RA or CCR7 or both. The CD45RA+CCR7- cells, considered to be
terminally differentiated, fail to divide, but do produce
interferon-gamma (147570) and express high levels of perforin (170280).
The representation of subsets specific for CMV and for HIV is distinct.
Approximately 70% of HIV-specific CD8+ memory T cells are
double-negative or preterminally differentiated compared to 40% of
CMV-specific cells. Approximately 50% of the CMV-specific CD8+ memory T
cells are terminally differentiated compared to fewer than 10% of the
HIV-specific cells. Champagne et al. (2001) proposed that terminally
differentiated CMV-specific cells are poised to rapidly intervene, while
double-positive precursor cells remain for expansion and replenishment
of the effector cell pool. Furthermore, high-dose antigen tolerance and
the depletion of HIV-specific CD4+ helper T-cell activity may keep the
HIV-specific memory CD8+ T cells at the double-negative stage, unable to
differentiate to the terminal effector state.

B lymphocytes recirculate between B cell-rich compartments (follicles or
B zones) in secondary lymphoid organs, surveying for antigen. After
antigen binding, B cells move to the boundary of B and T zones to
interact with T-helper cells. Reif et al. (2002) demonstrated that
antigen-engaged B cells have increased expression of CCR7, the receptor
for the T-zone chemokines CCL19 (also known as ELC) and CCL21 (602737),
and that they exhibit increased responsiveness to both chemoattractants.
In mice lacking lymphoid CCL19 and CCL21 chemokines, or with B cells
that lack CCR7, antigen engagement fails to cause movement to the T
zone. Using retroviral-mediated gene transfer, the authors demonstrated
that increased expression of CCR7 is sufficient to direct B cells to the
T zone. Reciprocally, overexpression of CXCR5 (601613), the receptor for
the B-zone chemokine CXCL13 (605149), is sufficient to overcome
antigen-induced B-cell movement to the T zone. Reif et al. (2002)
concluded that their findings defined the mechanism of B-cell
relocalization in response to antigen, and established that cell
position in vivo can be determined by the balance of responsiveness to
chemoattractants made in separate but adjacent zones.

Using RT-PCR, Pan et al. (2008) showed that both COX2 (PTGS2; 600262)
and CCR7 were upregulated in a significant number of breast tumor
samples compared with adjacent normal tissue, and that this upregulation
was associated with enhanced lymph node metastasis. Overexpression and
knockdown studies in human breast cancer cell lines revealed that COX2
acted via the prostaglandin receptors EP2 (PTGER2; 176804) and EP4
(PTGER4; 601586), resulting in increased intracellular cAMP and
activation of the PKA (see 188830)-AKT (see 164730) signaling pathway,
which led to induction of CCR7 expression. Elevated CCR7 enhanced the
migration of breast cancer cells toward lymphatic endothelial cells,
suggesting that CCR7 upregulation ultimately mediates COX2-associated
lymph node metastasis.

Using animal modeling and gene expression profiling, Buonamici et al.
(2009) showed that the chemokine receptor CCR7 is the essential adhesion
signal required for the targeting of leukemic T cells into the central
nervous system (CNS) in T-ALL. Ccr7 gene expression is controlled by the
activity of the T-ALL oncogene Notch1 (190198) and is expressed in human
tumors carrying Notch1-activating mutations. Silencing of either CCR7 or
its chemokine ligand CCL19 (602227) in an animal model of T-ALL
specifically inhibited CNS infiltration. Furthermore, murine CNS
targeting by human T-ALL cells depended on their ability to express
CCR7. Buonamici et al. (2009) concluded that their studies identified a
single chemokine-receptor interaction as a CNS 'entry' signal, and
opened the way for future pharmacologic targeting. Targeted inhibition
of CNS involvement in T-ALL could potentially decrease the intensity of
CNS-targeted therapy, thus reducing its associated short- and long-term
complications.

Using flow cytometric analysis, Beauvillain et al. (2011) demonstrated
that 10 to 30% of human and mouse neutrophils expressed surface and
intracellular CCR7 after purification. RT-PCR analysis detected CCR7
mRNA in mouse bone marrow neutrophils, but not in human or mouse
circulating neutrophils. Transwell assays showed that CCL19 and CCL21
induced human neutrophil migration after stimulation with
lipopolysaccharide and GMCSF (CSF2; 138960), indicating that CCR7
expressed on neutrophils is functional. Neutrophils from mice lacking
Ccr7 did not migrate to lymph nodes. Beauvillain et al. (2011) concluded
that a subpopulation of neutrophils constitutively express CCR7 and that
CCR7 is involved in migration of neutrophils from the periphery to lymph
nodes.

MAPPING

Schweickart et al. (1994) mapped the EBI1 gene to 17q12-q21.2 by
analysis of human/mouse somatic cell hybrid DNAs and fluorescence in
situ hybridization.

ANIMAL MODEL

To test the function of CCR7, Forster et al. (1999) generated mice in
which the Ccr7 gene had been disrupted by gene targeting. Lymph nodes of
Ccr7-deficient mice were devoid of naive T cells and dendritic cells,
whereas the T-cell population was heavily expanded in the blood, the red
pulp of the spleen, and the bone marrow. Adoptive transfer experiments
to wildtype recipients demonstrated that the migration of Ccr7-deficient
B and T cells into lymph nodes and Peyer patches, and of T cells into
the splenic periarteriolar lymphoid sheath, was severely hampered. When
compared to wildtype B cells, Ccr7-deficient B cells rapidly left the
outer periarteriolar lymphoid sheath after being transferred into
wildtype recipients, indicating that expression of CCR7 keeps B cells
for a defined period of time in close contact with T cells to allow
effective T-cell/B-cell interactions. Therefore, the authors suggested
that the overall disturbed microarchitecture of secondary lymphoid
organs, caused by the impaired entry and retention of lymphocytes and
antigen-presenting dendritic cells, might explain why Ccr7-deficient
mice failed to mount a rapid primary B- or T-cell response.

Using transgenic mice, adoptive transfer, and flow cytometric analysis,
Ploix et al. (2001) showed that expression of a CCR7 ligand, CCL21, is
necessary for CD4+ but not CD8+ T cells to reach their steady state 'set
point,' even in lymphopenic recipients. In addition, adoptive transfer
of antigen-specific T cells into nonlymphopenic mice overexpressing
CCL21 caused autoimmune diabetes. The authors proposed that
perturbations in the expression of CCR7 ligands, such as CCL21 or CCL19,
may alter susceptibility to autoimmunity.
