613259	TITLE *613259 REPETIN; RPTN
DESCRIPTION The RPTN gene encodes repetin, an extracellular epidermal matrix protein
that is expressed in the epidermis and at high levels in eccrine sweat
glands, the inner sheaths of hair roots, and the filiform papilli of the
tongue (summary by Green et al., 2010).

CLONING

Using mouse Rptn to probe a human chromosome 1-specific cosmid library,
followed by 5-prime RACE of human keratinocyte RNA, Huber et al. (2005)
cloned full-length RPTN. The deduced 784-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 91 kD. RPTN contains 2 N-terminal EF hand
motifs, a central domain containing 28 repeats of the consensus sequence
QxDRQGQSSHYG, and a glutamine- and arginine-rich C-terminal domain.
Northern blot analysis detected a 4-kb RPTN transcript in human thymus,
epidermis, and foreskin and in keratinocyte suspension cultures. Very
low expression was detected in adherent keratinocyte cultures, and none
was detected in other tissues. Immunofluorescence analysis detected RPTN
in the upper granular layer of human interfollicular epidermis, in
acrosyringium, in the upper cell layers of foreskin epidermis, in a
granular pattern in filiform papillae of tongue, in upper layer cells of
lingual interpapillae, and in the inner root sheath of hair follicle.
Immunoelectron microscopy showed strongest RPTN immunoreactivity in
granular layers associated with keratohyalin granules, with more diffuse
cytoplasmic expression in the transition zone between stratum granulosum
and stratum corneum. RPTN was not expressed in upper cornified layers of
skin. RPTN had an apparent molecular mass of 100 kD by SDS-PAGE.

GENE FUNCTION

Huber et al. (2005) showed that the recombinant N-terminal domain of
RPTN bound calcium reversibly.

GENE STRUCTURE

Huber et al. (2005) determined that the RPTN gene contains 3 exons and
spans at least 5.6 kb. The first exon is noncoding.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis and FISH, Huber et al. (2005) mapped the
RPTN gene to chromosome 1q21, where it lies between the trichohyalin
(TCHH; 190370) and profilaggrin (FLG; 135940) genes within the epidermal
differentiation complex. They mapped the mouse Rptn gene to a region of
chromosome 3F that shares homology of synteny with human chromosome
1q21.

EVOLUTION

Green et al. (2010) published a draft sequence of the Neandertal genome.
Comparisons of the Neandertal genome to the genomes of 5 present-day
humans from different parts of the world identified a number of genomic
regions that may have been affected by positive selection in ancestral
modern humans, including genes involved in metabolism and in cognitive
and skeletal development. Green et al. (2010) found 78 nucleotide
substitutions that change the protein coding capacity of genes where
modern humans are fixed for a derived state and where Neandertals carry
the ancestral (chimpanzee-like) state. Thus, relatively few amino acid
changes have become fixed in the last few hundred thousand years of
human evolution, an observation consistent with a complementary study
(Burbano et al., 2010). There are only 5 genes with more than 1 fixed
substitution changing the primary structure of the encoding proteins.
One of these is RPTN, which encodes repetin, an extracellular epidermal
matrix protein that is expressed in the epidermis and at high levels in
eccrine sweat glands, the inner sheaths of hair roots, and the filiform
papilli of the tongue. Green et al. (2010) also showed that Neandertals
shared more genetic variants with present-day humans in Eurasia than
with present-day humans in sub-Saharan Africa, suggesting that gene flow
from Neandertals into the ancestors of non-Africans occurred before the
divergence of Eurasian groups from each other.

607051	TITLE *607051 START DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 6; STARD6
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Cholesterol homeostasis is regulated, at least in part, by sterol
regulatory element (SRE)-binding proteins (e.g., SREBP1; 184756) and by
liver X receptors (e.g., LXRA; 602423). Upon sterol depletion, LXRs are
inactive and SREBPs are cleaved, after which they bind promoter SREs and
activate genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis and uptake. Sterol
transport is mediated by vesicles or by soluble protein carriers, such
as steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (STAR; 600617). STAR is
homologous to a family of proteins containing a 200- to 210-amino acid
STAR-related lipid transfer (START) domain, including STARD6 (Soccio et
al., 2002).

CLONING

By EST database searching for cDNAs with homology to STARD4 (607048),
Soccio et al. (2002) obtained cDNAs encoding mouse and human STARD6 and
STARD5 (607050). The deduced 220-amino acid STARD6 protein is 26% and
32% identical to STARD4 and STARD5, respectively, and consists entirely
of a START domain. Northern blot analysis revealed expression of a
1.5-kb transcript restricted to testis.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Soccio et al. (2002) determined that the
STARD6 gene contains 6 coding exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Soccio et al. (2002) mapped that the
STARD6 gene to chromosome 18q21.

601128	TITLE *601128 H3 HISTONE, FAMILY 3A; H3F3A
;;H3F3;;
H3.3A
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Histones are the basic nuclear proteins responsible for the nucleosome
structure within the chromosomal fiber in eukaryotes. Five classes of
histone genes have been reported. Some classes are expressed only during
S phase, while others are replication independent. The latter are
referred to as replacement histones and are expressed in quiescent or
terminally differentiated cells. H3.3 is a replacement histone that is
encoded by 2 distinct replication-independent genes, H3.3A (H3F3A) and
H3.3B (H3F3B; 601058). The proteins encoded by the H3.3A and H3.3B genes
are identical (summary by Wells et al. (1987) and Albig et al. (1995)).

For additional background information on histones, histone gene
clusters, and the H3 histone family, see HIST1H3A (602810).

CLONING

Using an H3.3 pseudogene cDNA to probe a human fibroblast cDNA library,
Wells and Kedes (1985) cloned H3.3. The transcript contains a long
3-prime poly(A) tail, and the deduced protein contains 135 amino acids.
The H3.3 protein has 5 amino acid changes compared with H3.1 (see
602812), but their nucleotide sequences are more divergent. Northern
blot analysis detected a transcript of about 1.2 kb in HeLa cell poly(A)
RNA.

Chalmers and Wells (1990) showed that the rabbit H3.3a 3-prime
untranslated region is 94% similar to the human sequence of Wells and
Kedes (1985), indicating that evolutionary conservation extends beyond
the coding region.

Witt et al. (1997) noted that although the H3.3A and H3.3B proteins are
identical, their nucleotide coding sequences and flanking portions
differ. They reported that H3.3a was basally expressed in mouse testis,
whereas H3.3b was expressed in a stage-specific manner.

Using Northern blot analysis, Frank et al. (2003) assayed for expression
of the replacement histones H3.3A and H3.3B and the cell cycle-dependent
histone H3/m (HIST2H3C; 142780) in human tissues and cell lines. All 6
cell lines expressed H3.3A, H3.3B, and H3/m at high levels. Conversely,
fetal liver predominantly expressed H3/m, likely due to its rapid cell
growth, whereas adult liver, kidney, and heart predominantly expressed
H3.3A and H3.3B. The H3.3A transcript was detected at 1.0 kb.

GENE STRUCTURE

Wells and Kedes (1985) determined that the 5-prime UTR of the H3F3A gene
is GC rich (75%).

Wells et al. (1987) determined that the H3F3A gene contains 4 exons and
spans 8.8 kb. The first exon is noncoding. The 5-prime end contains
noncanonical TATA and CCAAT boxes and an SP1 (189906)-binding GC box.
The 3-prime end contains 2 potential polyadenylation signals and is
highly conserved, sharing 85% identity with the chicken ortholog.

MAPPING

By analysis of a somatic cell hybrid panel and by inclusion within a YAC
from that region, Lin and Wells (1997) mapped the H3F3A gene to
chromosome 1q41.

GENE FUNCTION

See HIST1H3A (602810) for functional information on the H3 histone
family.

- H3.3 Histone

Hake et al. (2006) noted that most studies on expression or
posttranslational modifications of H3 histones do not differentiate
between the H3.1 (see 602810), H3.2 (HIST2H3C; 142780), and H3.3
proteins, in part due to their high degree of amino acid identity. By
quantitative PCR of 5 human cell lines, they found that the 9 H3.1
genes, 1 H3.2 gene, and 2 H3.3 genes examined were expressed in a cell
line-specific manner. All 3 types of H3 genes were highly expressed
during S phase in human cell lines, whereas the H3.3 genes were also
highly expressed outside of S phase, consistent with their status as
replication-independent genes. Using a combination of isotopic labeling
and quantitative tandem mass spectrometry, Hake et al. (2006) showed
that the H3.1, H3.2, and H3.3 proteins differed in their
posttranslational modifications. H3.1 was enriched in marks associated
with both gene activation and gene silencing, H3.2 was enriched in
repressive marks associated with gene silencing and the formation of
facultative heterochromatin, and H3.3 was enriched in marks associated
with transcriptional activation. Hake et al. (2006) concluded that H3.1,
H3.2, and H3.3 likely have unique functions and should not be treated as
equivalent proteins.

Jin et al. (2009) characterized the genomewide distribution of
nucleosome core particles containing H3.3 and/or H2A.Z (H2AFZ; 142763)
in HeLa cells. They found that highly labile particles containing both
H3.3 and H2A.Z were enriched at active promoters, enhancers, and
insulator regions. Nucleosomes containing H3.3, but not H2A.Z, were also
relatively unstable and were detected along the transcribed region of
genes and at transcriptional stop sites. Jin et al. (2009) suggested
that unstable particles containing both H3.3 and H2A.Z may serve as
place holders that are easily displaced by transcription factors. They
proposed that unstable particles containing only H3.3 along the
transcribed portions of genes may accommodate the passage of RNA
polymerase.

Xu et al. (2010) reported that significant amounts of histone H3.3-H4
(see 602822) tetramers split in vivo, whereas most H3.1 (see 602810)-H4
tetramers remain intact during mitotic division. Inhibiting DNA
replication-dependent deposition greatly reduced the level of splitting
events, which suggested that (i) the replication-independent H3.3
deposition pathway proceeds largely by cooperatively incorporating 2 new
H3.3-H4 dimers, and (ii) the majority of splitting events occur during
replication-dependent deposition. Xu et al. (2010) concluded that
'silent' histone modifications within large heterochromatic regions are
maintained by copying modifications from neighboring preexisting
histones without the need for H3-H4 splitting events.

Talbert and Henikoff (2010) reviewed the assembly of canonical
nucleosomes, which is thought to begin with a tetramer of 2 H3 molecules
and 2 H4 molecules held together by strong bonds between the H3
molecules. H3.1 is the major canonical H3 assembled into chromatin by
the histone chaperone CAF1 (see 601246) complex during DNA replication
and repair. The replacement histone H3.3 is assembled by the histone
regulator A (HIRA; 600237) complex independently of DNA synthesis.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Elsasser et al. (2012) reported the crystal structures of the DAXX
(603186) histone-binding domain with a histone H3.3-H4 (see 602822)
dimer, including mutants within DAXX and H3.3, together with in vitro
and in vivo functional studies that elucidated the principles underlying
H3.3 recognition specificity. Occupying 40% of the histone
surface-accessible area, DAXX wraps around the H3.3-H4 dimer, with
complex formation accompanied by structural transitions in the H3.3-H4
histone fold. DAXX uses an extended alpha-helical conformation to
compete with major interhistone, DNA, and ASF1 interaction sites.
Elsasser et al. (2012) concluded that their structural studies
identified recognition elements that read out H3.3-specific residues,
and functional studies addressed the contribution of gly90 in H3.3 and
glu225 in DAXX to chaperone-mediated H3.3 variant recognition
specificity.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Schwartzentruber et al. (2012) sequenced the exomes of 48 pediatric
glioblastoma (137800) samples. Somatic mutations in the H3.3-ATRX
(300032)-DAXX (603186) chromatin remodeling pathway were identified in
44% of tumors (21 of 48). Recurrent mutations in H3F3A, which encodes
the replication-independent histone-3 variant H3.3, were observed in 31%
of tumors, and led to amino acid substitutions at 2 critical positions
within the histone tail (K27M, G34R/G34V) involved in key regulatory
posttranslational modifications. Mutations in ATRX and DAXX, encoding 2
subunits of a chromatin remodeling complex required for H3.3
incorporation at pericentric heterochromatin and telomeres, were
identified in 31% of samples overall, and in 100% of tumors harboring a
G34R or G34V H3.3 mutation. Somatic TP53 (191170) mutations were
identified in 54% of all cases, and in 86% of samples with H3F3A and/or
ATRX mutations. Screening of a large cohort of gliomas of various grades
and histologies (n = 784) showed H3F3A mutations to be specific to
glioblastoma multiforme and highly prevalent in children and young
adults. Furthermore, the presence of H3F3A/ATRX-DAXX/TP53 mutations was
strongly associated with alternative lengthening of telomeres and
specific gene expression profiles. Schwartzentruber et al. (2012) stated
that this was the first report to highlight recurrent mutations in a
regulatory histone in humans, and that their data suggested that defects
of the chromatin architecture underlie pediatric and young adult
glioblastoma multiforme pathogenesis.

Wu et al. (2012) reported that a K27M mutation occurring in either H3F3A
or HIST1H3B (602819) was observed in 78% of diffuse intrinsic pontine
gliomas (DIPGs) and 22% of non-brain-stem gliomas.

Lewis et al. (2013) reported that human DIPGs containing the K27M
mutation in either histone H3.3 (H3F3A) or H3.1 (HIST1H3B) display
significantly lower overall amounts of H3 with trimethylated lysine-27
(H3K27me3) and that histone H3K27M transgenes are sufficient to reduce
the amounts of H3K27me3 in vitro and in vivo. Lewis et al. (2013) found
that H3K27M inhibits the enzymatic activity of the Polycomb repressive
complex-2 (PRC2) through interaction with the EZH2 (601573) subunit. In
addition, transgenes containing lysine-to-methionine substitutions at
other known methylated lysines (H3K9 and H3K36) are sufficient to cause
specific reduction in methylation through inhibition of SET domain
enzymes. Lewis et al. (2013) proposed that K-to-M substitutions may
represent a mechanism to alter epigenetic states in a variety of
pathologies.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Adams et al. (1992) identified a novel cDNA representing an mRNA showing
significantly higher levels of expression in benign breast lesions than
in carcinomas. In both tissues, expression was highest in epithelial
cells, as determined by in situ hybridization to tissue sections. The
protein deduced from the nucleotide sequence was highly basic with no
signal or transmembrane sequence, but 2 potential nuclear localization
signals. The cDNA hybridized to multiple sequences within both human and
other mammalian genomes and to single genomic sequences in Drosophila,
Physarum, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Thus the cDNA represents a
highly conserved gene sequence. Only 1 major transcript was identified
in human cells, but the existence of several pseudogenes was suspected.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid and radiation hybrid analyses, Kenmochi et al.
(1998) mapped the RPL13 gene to chromosome 16.

607635	TITLE *607635 CARBOXYPEPTIDASE A4; CPA4
;;CPA3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using the mRNA differential display technique, Huang et al. (1999)
identified a novel protein, carboxypeptidase A4, that was upregulated in
a sodium butyrate-treated prostate cancer (176807) cell line. They
assembled a full-length CPA4 cDNA, which they had designated CPA3, by
use of 5-prime RACE. The deduced 421-amino acid CPA4 protein contains 2
zinc-binding signature domains of metallocarboxypeptidases and a
16-amino acid N-terminal signal peptide. The protein shares 63% and 61%
sequence identity with human and rat CPA2 (600688), respectively.
Northern blot analysis detected strong expression of a 3-kb CPA4
transcript in prostate cancer cell lines but no expression of the gene
in any of the human tissues tested. RT-PCR detected very low expression
of CPA4 in some normal tissues, including prostate.

GENE FUNCTION

Huang et al. (1999) found that trichostatin A as well as sodium
butyrate, both inhibitors of histone deacetylase, induced CPA4 mRNA
expression, suggesting that CPA4 gene induction is mediated by histone
hyperacetylation. They also demonstrated that the induction of CPA4 by
sodium butyrate was specifically inhibited by antisense p21(WAF1)
(CDKN1A; 116899).

Because of the expression pattern of CPA4 as well as its location at a
putative prostate cancer aggressiveness locus at chromosome 7q32 (Witte
et al., 2000), Kayashima et al. (2003) investigated its imprinting
status in fetal tissues and in adult benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH;
600082). RT-PCR using 4 intragenic polymorphisms as markers showed that
CPA4 is expressed preferentially from the maternal allele in fetal
heart, lung, liver, intestine, kidney, adrenal gland, and spleen, but
not in fetal brain. It is also preferentially expressed in BPH. These
findings suggested that CPA4 is imprinted and may be a strong candidate
gene for prostate cancer aggressiveness.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Pallares et al. (2005) described the structure of CPA4 in complex with
its endogenous inhibitor, LXN (609305). CPA4 is a compact protein
hollowed out in a funnel-like shape, with the active site at the bottom
of the funnel. In the CPA4/LXN complex, CPA4 is bound at the top of the
funnel by the interface of the N- and C-terminal subdomains of LXN. The
complex occludes a large contact surface but makes few contacts.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kayashima et al. (2003) determined that the CPA4 gene consists of 11
exons.

MAPPING

In a search for novel imprinted genes in the vicinity of the imprinted
gene MEST (601029) on chromosome 7q32, Kayashima et al. (2003)
identified the CPA4 gene in a cluster with other members of the
carboxypeptidase family, 200 kb centromeric to MEST.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

One or more imprinted genes on chromosome 7q32-qter have been postulated
to be involved in the interuterine growth retardation associated with
Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS; 180860) as 7 to 10% of patients have
maternal uniparental disomy (UPD). Bentley et al. (2003) found that the
imprinted region on 7q32 extends to the carboxypepidase A gene cluster.
SNP analysis by sequencing RT-PCR products of CPA1 (114850), CPA2, CPA4,
and CPA5 (609561) indicated preferential expression of CPA4 only. As
CPA4 has a potential role in cell proliferation and differentiation, 2
preferentially expressed copies of maternal UPD patients with SRS
syndrome would result in excess expression and could alter the growth
profiles of these subjects and give rise to intrauterine growth
restriction.

Because a locus for Silver-Russell syndrome had been proposed to be
located on 7q32 and involved in imprinting, Kayashima et al. (2003)
screened for mutations in the CPA4 gene in 10 SRS patients, but found
none.

GROWTH ARREST- AND DNA DAMAGE-INDUCIBLE GENE GADD153; GADD153
CHOP/FUS FUSION GENE, INCLUDED;;
CHOP/EWS FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Ron and Habener (1992) cloned mouse Ddit3, which they called Chop.
Antisera raised against Chop recognized a nuclear protein with a
molecular mass of 29 kD.

Park et al. (1992) isolated the DDIT3 gene, which they called GADD153,
from human cells. The DDIT3 gene shows a high level of conservation in
both the structural and regulatory regions to the previously described
hamster gene. The human and hamster proteins share 91% amino acid
identity.

GENE FUNCTION

Ron and Habener (1992) showed that CHOP serves as a dominant-negative
inhibitor of the transcription factors C/EBP (116897, 116898) and LAP
(189965). They found that bacterially expressed CHOP inhibited the
DNA-binding activity of C/EBP and LAP by forming heterodimers that could
not bind DNA.

Using differential expression and immunohistochemical analyses of benign
nevi and melanomas of different levels, Korabiowska et al. (1997)
observed p53 (TP53; 191170) negativity and high expression of GADD34
(PPP1R15A; 611048), GADD45 (GADD45A; 126335), and GADD153 in all nevi.
However, in melanomas, p53 expression increased and GADD expression
decreased with the Clark level of melanoma thickness. Patient survival
time correlated negatively with p53 positivity and positively with
GADD45 and GADD153 expression. Korabiowska et al. (1997) concluded that
GADD proteins play an important role in the malignant transformation of
nevus to melanoma.

CHOP is activated by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress imposed by
unfolded and malfolded proteins. By transcriptional profiling, Marciniak
et al. (2004) compared gene expression in unstressed and ER-stressed
wildtype and Chop -/- primary mouse embryo fibroblasts. They found that
Chop directly activated Gadd34, which promoted ER protein biosynthesis
by dephosphorylating Eif2-alpha (EIF2S1; 603907) in stressed cells,
causing accumulation of high molecular mass protein complexes in the
stressed ER. Chop also activated Ero1-alpha (ERO1L; 615435), which
encodes an ER oxidase. Consequently, the ER of stressed Chop -/- cells
was hypooxidized relative to the ER of stressed wildtype cells.
Pharmacologic and genetic manipulations promoting a hypooxidized ER
reduced abnormal high molecular mass protein complexes and protected
cells from the lethal consequences of ER stress. Marciniak et al. (2004)
concluded that Chop deletion protected cells from ER stress by
decreasing ER protein load and changing redox conditions.

GENE STRUCTURE

Park et al. (1992) determined that the human and hamster DDIT3 genes
both contain 4 exons, with the intron/exon junctions maintained at
identical positions.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid analysis and in situ hybridization, Park et al.
(1992) mapped the DDIT3 gene to chromosome 12q13.1-q13.2.

CYTOGENETICS

CHOP is consistently rearranged in myxoid liposarcomas (613488) (Aman et
al., 1992). In the characteristic chromosomal translocation
t(12;16)(q13;p11), Crozat et al. (1993) showed that the CHOP gene is
fused with a gene on chromosome 16 provisionally designated TLS
(translocated in liposarcoma). The same gene was called FUS by Rabbitts
et al. (1993); see 137070. The TLS gene was found to be a novel nuclear
RNA-binding protein with extensive sequence similarity to EWS (133450),
the product of a gene commonly translocated in Ewing sarcoma (612219).
In TLS-CHOP, the RNA-binding domain of TLS is replaced by the
DNA-binding and leucine zipper dimerization domain of CHOP. Targeting of
a conserved effector domain of RNA-binding proteins to DNA may play a
role in tumor formation.

In an analysis of peripheral blood samples from 19 patients with myxoid
liposarcoma due to t(12;16) and in 1 patient with myxoid liposarcoma due
to t(12;22;20), resulting in the fusion of the CHOP and EWS genes,
Panagopoulos et al. (1996) found FUS/CHOP hybrid fragments in 3 patients
with t(12;16) and a EWS/CHOP hybrid in the patient with the latter
translocation.

ANIMAL MODEL

Endo et al. (2006) found that mice challenged intratracheally with
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) expressed Chop and Bip (HSPA5; 138120).
Compared with wildtype mice, mice lacking Chop showed reduced lung
inflammation in response to LPS, diminished Il1b (147720) activity, and
suppression of Casp11 (SFRS2IP; 603668) induction in bronchoalveolar
lavage fluid. Inflammation of lung in response to Il1b was not
attenuated in Chop-deficient mice. Endo et al. (2006) concluded that
CHOP is critical in LPS-induced lung injury and in induction of CASP11,
which mediates activation of pro-CASP1 (147678) and pro-IL1B.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Chromosomal segregation during mitosis as well as meiosis is regulated
by kinases and phosphatases. The Aurora kinases associate with
microtubules during chromosome movement and segregation. Aurora kinase B
localizes to microtubules near kinetochores, specifically to the
specialized microtubules called K-fibers, and Aurora kinase A (603072)
localizes to centrosomes (Lampson et al., 2004).

CLONING

The Drosophila 'aurora' and S. cerevisiae Ipl1 serine/threonine protein
kinases (STKs) are involved in mitotic events such as centrosome
separation and chromosome segregation. Using a degenerate primer-based
PCR method to screen for novel STKs, Shindo et al. (1998) isolated mouse
and human cDNAs encoding STK12, which they termed ARK2 (aurora-related
kinase-2). Sequence analysis of human STK12 predicted a 344-amino acid
protein containing kinase domains that share high homology with the
catalytic domains of other STKs. Cell cycle and Northern blot analyses
showed that STK12 is expressed in the S phase and persistently
thereafter. Western blot analysis indicated that STK12 is localized in
the midbodies during anaphase.

By searching sequence databases for clones homologous to AIK (AURKA;
603072), Kimura et al. (1998) obtained a cDNA encoding STK12, which they
designated AIK2 (aurora/Ip11-like kinase-2). Northern blot analysis
detected strong expression of a 1.5-kb STK12 transcript in thymus, with
weaker expression in small intestine, testis, colon, spleen, and brain.
Western blot analysis demonstrated expression of a 39-kD STK12 protein.

By screening a HeLa cell cDNA library with a rat Aim1 (aurora- and
Ipl1-like midbody-associated protein) probe, Katayama et al. (1998)
isolated a cDNA encoding STK12. A kinase-negative STK12 mutant was shown
to induce a failure in cytokinesis during mitosis. The authors found
that during differentiation of megakaryocytes, there is no cytokinesis
and reduced expression of STK12. Tatsuka et al. (1998) found that STK12
is highly expressed as a 1.2-kb transcript in transformed cell lines but
not in normal fibroblasts. They also showed that STK12 is associated
with multinuclearity and polyploidy.

GENE FUNCTION

By immunoprecipitation of epitope-tagged proteins from transfected
HEK293 cells, Kunitoku et al. (2003) demonstrated direct interaction
between CENPA (117139) and AURKA. In vitro, AURKA phosphorylated CENPA
on ser7, a residue that is also phosphorylated by AURKB. Examination of
the role of both kinases in the phosphorylation of CENPA revealed that
the reaction is mediated sequentially by AURKA and AURKB in early
mitosis. Mitotic cells in which the phosphorylation of CENPA on ser7 was
prevented exhibited a substantial proportion of misaligned chromosomes
resulting from a defect in the ability of kinetochores to attach to
microtubules.

Lampson et al. (2004) examined the role of Aurora kinases during mitosis
in rat kangaroo kidney cells with use of small reversible inhibitors of
molecular motors and Aurora kinases. Maloriented chromosomes accumulated
in the presence of an Aurora kinase inhibitor following spindle
bipolarization. The inhibitor was removed to activate the kinase and the
orientation of the chromosomes was corrected. In the correction process,
the maloriented chromosomes first moved to the pole, then moved to the
opposite pole, resulting in alignment at the metaphase plate. The manner
of K-fiber shortening suggested that kinetochores remained attached to
the microtubule plus ends, and that Aurora B function had been
interrupted by the inhibitor. Lampson et al. (2004) concluded that
syntelic malorientations (both sister kinetocores attached to the same
pole) can be corrected by selective K-fiber disassembly, coupled with
movement to the pole.

Andrews et al. (2004) presented evidence that Aurora B inhibits the
microtubule depolymerizing activity of mitotic centromere-associated
kinesin (MCAK; 604538) by phosphorylating MCAK on ser92. This
phosphorylation also regulated MCAK translocalization from kinetochores
to the centromere, and disruption of Aurora B function prevented
centromeric MCAK targeting. Andrews et al. (2004) concluded that Aurora
B regulates MCAK activity and cellular localization.

Hirota et al. (2005) showed that antibodies against mitotic chromosome
antigens that are associated with human autoimmune diseases specifically
recognize histone H3 (see 602810) molecules that are modified by both
trimethylation of lys9 and phosphorylation of ser10 (H3K9me3S10ph). The
generation of H3K9me3S10ph depends on Suv39h (see 300254) and Aurora B,
and occurs at pericentric heterochromatin during mitosis in different
eukaryotes. Most heterochromatin protein-1 (HP1; 604478) typically
dissociates from chromosomes during mitosis, but if phosphorylation of
H3 ser10 is inhibited, HP1 remains chromosome-bound throughout mitosis.
H3 phosphorylation by Aurora B is therefore part of a 'methyl/phos
switch' mechanism that displaces HP1 and perhaps other proteins from
mitotic heterochromatin.

Ramadan et al. (2007) showed that p97 (601023) stimulates nucleus
reformation by inactivating the chromatin-associated kinase Aurora B.
During mitosis, Aurora B inhibits nucleus reformation by preventing
chromosome decondensation and formation of the nuclear envelope
membrane. During exit from mitosis, p97 binds to Aurora B after its
ubiquitylation and extracts it from chromatin. This leads to
inactivation of Aurora B on chromatin, thus allowing chromatin
decondensation and nuclear envelope formation. Ramadan et al. (2007)
concluded that their data revealed an essential pathway that regulates
reformation of the nucleus after mitosis and defined ubiquitin-dependent
protein extraction as a common mechanism of Cdc48/p97 activity also
during nucleus formation.

Rosasco-Nitcher et al. (2008) investigated the activation of Aurora B
and described 2 distinct activation mechanisms. First, Aurora B
activation in vitro requires 2 cofactors, telophase disc-60 kD, or TD60
(RCC2; 609587) and microtubules. TD60 is critical to localize both the
chromosome passenger complex (CPC) and haspin (609240) kinase activity
to centromeres and thus regulates Aurora B at several levels. Second,
Aurora B substrates can inhibit kinase activation, and this is relieved
by phosphorylation of these substrates by the centromeric kinases Plk1
(602098) and haspin. Rosasco-Nitcher et al. (2008) concluded that these
regulatory mechanisms suggested models for phosphorylation by Aurora B
of centromeric substrates at unaligned chromosomes and merotelic
attachments.

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis of a HeLa cell cDNA library and pull-down
assays using recombinant proteins, Sun et al. (2008) showed that the
C-terminal tail of EB1 (MAPRE1; 603108) interacted specifically with the
catalytic domain of AURKB. The proteins colocalized on the central
spindle in anaphase and in the midbody during cytokinesis in simian
kidney cells, and endogenous EB1 and AURKB coimmunoprecipitated from
HeLa cells. EB1 overexpression enhanced AURKB kinase activity, and
knockdown of EB1 with small interfering RNA impaired AURKB activity. EB1
protected AURKB from dephosphorylation/inactivation by protein
phosphatase-2A (PP2A; see 176915) by blocking binding of PP2A to AURKB.
Sun et al. (2008) concluded that EB1 stimulates AURKB activity by
antagonizing its dephosphorylation/inactivation by PP2A.

Using fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based biosensors to measure
localized phosphorylation dynamics in living cells, Liu et al. (2009)
found that phosphorylation of an Aurora B substrate at the kinetochore
depended on its distance from the kinase at the inner centromere.
Furthermore, repositioning Aurora B closer to the kinetochore prevented
stabilization of bioriented attachments and activated the spindle
checkpoint. Thus, Liu et al. (2009) concluded that centromere tension
can be sensed by increased spatial separation of Aurora B from
kinetochore substrates, which reduces phosphorylation and stabilizes
kinetochore microtubules.

Wang et al. (2010) showed that phosphorylation of histone H3 threonine-3
(H3T3) by haspin is necessary for CPC accumulation at centromeres and
that the CPC subunit survivin (603352) binds directly to phosphorylated
H3T3 (H3T3ph). A nonbinding survivin-D70A/D71A mutant did not support
CPC complex concentration, and both haspin depletion and
survivin-D70A/D71A mutation diminished centromere localization of the
kinesin MCAK (604538) and the mitotic checkpoint response to taxol.
Survivin-D70A/D71A mutation and microinjection of H3T3ph-specific
antibody both compromised centromeric Aurora B functions but did not
prevent cytokinesis. Therefore, Wang et al. (2010) concluded that H3T3ph
generated by haspin positions the CPC at centromeres to regulate
selected targets of Aurora B during mitosis.

Kelly et al. (2010) demonstrated that H3T3ph is directly recognized by
an evolutionarily conserved binding pocket in the BIR domain of the CPC
subunit survivin. This binding mediates recruitment of the CPC to
chromosomes and the resulting activation of its kinase subunit Aurora B.
Consistently, modulation of the kinase activity of haspin, which
phosphorylates H3T3, leads to defects in the Aurora B-dependent
processes of spindle assembly and inhibition of nuclear reformation.
Kelly et al. (2010) concluded that their findings established a direct
cellular role for mitotic H3T3 phosphorylation, which is read and
translated by the CPC to ensure accurate cell division.

Yamagishi et al. (2010) showed that phosphorylation of H3T3 mediated by
haspin cooperates with bub1 (602452)-mediated histone 2A-serine-121
(H2A-S121) phosphorylation in targeting the CPC to the inner centromere
in fission yeast and human cells. Phosphorylated H3T3 promotes
nucleosome binding of survivin, whereas phosphorylated H2A-S121
facilitates the binding of shugoshin (609168), the centromeric CPC
adaptor. Haspin colocalizes with cohesin by associating with Pds5 (see
613200), whereas bub1 localizes at kinetochores. Thus, Yamagishi et al.
(2010) concluded that the inner centromere is defined by intersection of
2 histone kinases.

Campbell and Desai (2013) showed that an engineered truncation of the
Sli15 (INCENP; 604411) subunit of budding yeast CPC that eliminates
association with the inner centromere nevertheless supports proper
chromosome segregation during both mitosis and meiosis. Truncated Sli15
suppressed the deletion phenotypes of the inner centromere-targeting
proteins Bir1 (survivin), Nbl1 (borealin; 609977), Bub1, and Sgo1
(shugoshin). Unlike wildtype Sli15, truncated Sli15 localized to
preanaphase spindle microtubules. Premature targeting of full-length
Sli15 to microtubules by preventing Cdk1 (110940) phosphorylation also
suppressed the inviability of Bir1 deletion. Campbell and Desai (2013)
concluded that activation of Aurora B kinase by clustering either on
chromatin or on microtubules is sufficient for chromosome biorientation.

MAPPING

By FISH and radiation hybrid analysis, Kimura et al. (1998) mapped the
STK12 gene to 17p13.1. Tatsuka et al. (1998) noted that the STK12 gene
is localized in a region that is frequently deleted in tumors and that
contains tumor-related genes such as p53 (191170), CRK (164762), and ABR
(600365). Using interspecific backcross mapping, Shindo et al. (1998)
mapped the mouse Stk12 gene to chromosome 11 in a region showing
homology of synteny with human 17p.
