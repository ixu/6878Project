300654	TITLE *300654 FATTY ACID AMIDE HYDROLASE 2; FAAH2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Fatty acid amide hydrolases, such as FAAH1 (FAAH; 602935) and FAAH2,
hydrolyze primary fatty acid amide substrates (e.g., oleamide) and may
play a role in fatty acid catabolism (summary by Wei et al., 2006).

CLONING

By activity-based protein profiling in breast cancer and ovarian cancer
cell lines, Wei et al. (2006) cloned FAAH2. The deduced 532-amino acid
FAAH2 protein contains a predicted N-terminal transmembrane domain, an
amidase signature sequence containing the ser-ser-lys catalytic triad,
and shares approximately 20% amino acid identity with FAAH1. FAAH2 was
detected in the membrane fraction of transfected cancer cells, and
protein protection assays showed that FAAH2 is luminally oriented in the
membrane, unlike the cytoplasmic orientation of FAAH1. RT-PCR analysis
detected FAAH2 expression in human heart, kidney, liver, lung, and
prostate. Homologs of FAAH2 were identified in primates, marsupial, and
frog, but not in mouse or rat.

GENE FUNCTION

Wei et al. (2006) showed that mammalian cells expressing FAAH2 displayed
high oleamide hydrolase activity. FAAH2 displayed activity over a wide
range of endogenous fatty acid amide substrates and highest activity
with N-oleoyl ethanolamine (C18:1 N-acylethanolamine). Known inhibitors
of FAAH1 also inhibited FAAH2 activity.

MAPPING

Wei et al., 2006 noted that the FAAH2 gene maps to chromosome Xp11.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Ubiquitin is a small protein of 76 amino acids that is found exclusively
in eukaryotes and shows extreme evolutionary conservation. Comparison of
ubiquitin sequences from species ranging from yeast to human shows that
71 of the 76 residues are conserved. The human genome contains multiple
ubiquitin genes, many of which are nonfunctional reverse-transcribed
pseudogenes. The transcriptionally active genes generate mRNAs of
approximately 600, 1,000, and 2,500 nucleotides, and these have been
termed UBA, UBB (191339), and UBC (191340), respectively. The
600-nucleotide UBA transcripts encode human ubiquitin-ribosomal protein
fusion proteins and represent products of the UBA52 gene (Baker and
Board, 1991) and the UBA80 gene (191343; Lund et al., 1985).

CLONING

By screening a placental cDNA library with the tail-like region of the
EHD5 pseudogene as probe, Baker and Board (1991) isolated a cDNA
encoding a ubiquitin moiety followed by a 52-amino acid tail, which they
termed UBA52. UBA52 is 81% identical to yeast Ubi1/Ubi2 and shares
conserved cysteine residues. Northern blot analysis revealed expression
in lymphocytes and placenta.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Baker and Board (1991) determined that the
UBA52 gene contains 5 exons and spans more than 2 kb. The promoter is
located in a CpG-rich island, has SP1-binding sites, and lacks a TATA
motif, suggesting a structurally typical ribosomal protein gene.

MAPPING

Because of the relatively large number of ubiquitin pseudogenes, special
strategies are necessary to map the functional genes. Webb et al. (1994)
used an intron sequence to localize the UBA52 ubiquitin-ribosomal
protein fusion gene. Analysis of somatic cell hybrids containing
individual human chromosomes indicated that the UBA52 gene is located on
chromosome 19. In situ hybridization studies confirmed the chromosomal
localization but showed 2 peaks of hybridization: a major one over
19p13.1-p12 and a secondary one over 19q12-q13.11. Since the peak of
hybridization over the short arm was consistently the strongest in 5
individuals, Webb et al. (1994) considered it likely that this is the
localization of the UBA52 gene.

603363	TITLE *603363 CGG-BINDING PROTEIN 1; CGGBP1
;;CGG-BINDING PROTEIN, 20-KD;;
p20CGGBP
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CGGBP1 influences expression of the FMR1 gene (309550), which is
associated with the fragile X mental retardation syndrome (300624), by
specifically interacting with the 5-prime (CGG)n-3-prime repeat in its
5-prime UTR.

CLONING

Autonomous expansions of trinucleotide repeats with the general
structure (CGG)n are associated with several human genetic disorders.
Expansion of the (CGG)n repeat in the 5-prime UTR of FMR1 is accompanied
by extensive methylation of the CG dinucleotides in the repeat and is
associated with transcriptional silencing of the FMR1 gene. Deissler et
al. (1996) identified a 20-kD HeLa cell nuclear protein, p20-CGGBP
(CGG-binding protein), that specifically bound the double-stranded CGG
repeat. p20-CGGBP binding was severely inhibited by complete or partial
methylation of the binding motif. By searching an EST database with the
partial protein sequence of p20-CGGBP, Deissler et al. (1997) identified
a cDNA containing the entire p20-CGGBP coding region. The predicted
166-amino acid protein contains a putative nuclear localization signal.
Northern blot analysis revealed that p20-CGGBP is expressed as a 1.2-kb
transcript in HeLa cells. Dot blot hybridization indicated that this
mRNA is expressed in a number of human tissues. Using Southern blots,
Deissler et al. (1997) found that the p20-CGGBP gene is conserved among
mammals.

Naumann et al. (2004) identified an exon 3 splice variant of CGGBP1 as
well as several alternate polyadenylation signals. Northern blot
analysis detected transcripts of 4.5- and 1.2-kb expressed in varying
ratios in all adult and fetal tissues examined. Highest expression was
in adult skeletal muscle, thymus, and pancreas. Mouse Cggbp1 was
expressed in embryonic stem cells and throughout mouse embryonic
development.

GENE FUNCTION

Naumann et al. (2004) determined that the promoter region of CGGBP1 is
unmethylated in human cells, and in vitro methylation inactivated the
promoter in a reporter assay. They found that CGGBP1 bound to
5-prime-(CGG)n-3-prime repeats in vitro with n equal to or greater than
5. It also bound interrupted repeats.

GENE STRUCTURE

Naumann et al. (2004) determined that the CGGBP gene contains 4 exons,
with the entire open reading frame located within exon 4. The promoter
region contains CAAT boxes and several Sp1 (189906)-binding sites.

MAPPING

By analysis of a somatic cell hybrid panel, Deissler et al. (1997)
mapped the p20-CGGBP protein to human chromosome 3. Using FISH, Naumann
et al. (2004) mapped the CGGBP gene near the centromere on chromosome
3p.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) is a multisubunit complex that mediates
acidification of intracellular organelles. By large-scale sequencing of
a human fetal brain cDNA library and database searching, Fujiwara et al.
(1995) identified a sequence showing homology with the 14-kD subunit of
M. sexta V-ATPase. Using 5-prime RACE, they cloned a full-length cDNA
encoding a deduced 119-amino acid protein with a molecular mass of 14
kD. The protein is predominantly hydrophilic and shares 69% and 70%
sequence identity with the M. sexta and Drosophila homologs,
respectively. Northern blot analysis detected ubiquitous expression of a
0.8-kb transcript.

615051	TITLE *615051 ANKYRIN REPEAT- AND SOCS BOX-CONTAINING PROTEIN 6; ASB6
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Proteins of the ASB family, such as ASB6, contain central tandem ankyrin
(see 612641) repeats and a C-terminal suppressor of cytokine signaling
(SOCS) box. SOCS box proteins are predicted to be involved in protein
degradation by acting as a bridge between substrate proteins and E3
ubiquitin protein ligases (see 601623) (review by Kile et al., 2002).

CLONING

Kile et al. (2001) showed that the deduced 418-amino acid mouse Asb6
protein has 8 tandem ankyrin repeats and a C-terminal SOCS box.

GENE FUNCTION

Kohroki et al. (2005) found that epitope-tagged ASB6 and several other
ASB family members interacted with endogenous CUL5 (601741) and RBX2
(RNF7; 603863) in immunoprecipitated HEK293 cells. The ASB proteins did
not interact with CUL2 (603135) or RBX1 (603814).

MAPPING

Hartz (2013) mapped the ASB6 gene to chromosome 9q34.11 based on an
alignment of the ASB6 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK000555) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Klugbauer and Hofmann (1996) isolated cDNA clones encoding the ABCA3
protein, which they designated ABCA3, from a human medullary thyroid
cancer cell line. ABCA3 has typical structural features of the ABC
transporter family (see 600046). They determined that the transporter
consists of a 1,704-amino acid polypeptide with 2 homologous repeats,
each harboring 6 putative transmembrane helices and an ATP-binding
cassette motif. The ABCA3 protein showed approximately 50% homology with
the MRP1 (158343) protein.

Connors et al. (1997) independently cloned the ABCA3 gene. By Northern
blot analysis, they found that the 6.8-kb mRNA was present at highest
levels in lung.

Using the 5-prime UTR of mouse Abca3 as probe, Yamano et al. (2001)
cloned ABCA3 from a lung cDNA library. Western blot analysis of crude
membrane fractions of human lung determined that ABCA3 migrated at an
apparent molecular mass of 150 kD. Immunohistochemical analysis of
alveoli showed ABCA3 expression only in alveolar type II (ATII) cells
that also expressed surfactant protein A (see 178630). At the
ultrastructural level, ABCA3 immunoreactivity was detected mostly at the
limiting membrane of the lamellar bodies.

By homology analysis of partial sequences, Mulugeta et al. (2002) found
that the ABCA3 protein is highly conserved among species. ABCA3
transcripts were found in cell lines of human lung origin, in ATII cells
of human, rat, and mouse, and in various rat tissues. Highest expression
of rat Abca3 was in ATII cells, and expression of Abca3 was at its
maximum in rats prior to birth.

Yoshida et al. (2004) cloned and characterized the promoter region of
the human ABCA3 gene and identified a potential
glucocorticoid-responsive element (GRE) motif. Electrophoretic mobility
shift assay using nuclear extracts from dexamethasone-treated cells from
a human ATII cell line demonstrated specific binding of the
glucocorticoid receptor to the GRE.

MAPPING

Klugbauer and Hofmann (1996) mapped the ABCA3 gene to chromosome 16p13.3
by comparison with an identical cDNA clone mapping to that chromosomal
region. They noted that the ABCA3 gene and the gene encoding MRP1 map
within the same chromosomal band.

GENE FUNCTION

Wu and Horvitz (1998) found that the C. elegans protein ced7 is
homologous to human ABCA3. Ced-7 functions in the engulfment of cell
corpses during programmed cell death, is broadly expressed during
embryogenesis, and is localized to the plasma membrane. Mosaic analysis
revealed that ced7 functions in both dying cells and engulfing cells
during the engulfment process. Wu and Horvitz (1998) proposed that ced7
functions to translocate molecules that mediate homotypic adhesion
between the cell surfaces of the dying and engulfing cells. They also
suggested that ABCA3 may be functionally similar and that the molecular
mechanism underlying cell corpse engulfment during programmed cell death
may be conserved from nematodes to mammals.

By Northern blot analysis, Mulugeta et al. (2002) found the expression
of ABCA3 increased more than 30-fold following stimulation of fetal lung
explants with dexamethasone, cAMP, and isobutylmethylxanthine. Because
ABCA3 is a member of a subfamily of ABC transporters involved in the
regulation of lipid transport and membrane trafficking, Mulugeta et al.
(2002) proposed that ABCA3 may play a role in lipid organization during
the formation of lamellar bodies.

Shulenin et al. (2004) examined lung tissue from 4 patients with severe
neonatal surfactant deficiency and different mutations of the ABCA3
gene. They found markedly abnormal lamellar bodies and concluded that
ABCA3 is critical for the proper formation of lamellar bodies and
surfactant function.

Yoshida et al. (2004) found that expression of ABCA3 in rat lung is
dramatically increased after embryonic day (E) 20.5. Administration of
dexamethasone to pregnant rats for 3 days starting on E15.5 markedly
induced expression of ABCA3 by E18.5. Dexamethasone also increased ABCA3
mRNA expression levels in human ATII cells 4-fold and upregulated
promoter activity of the ABCA3 5-prime flanking region containing the
GRE about 2-fold. Upregulation by dexamethasone was not observed when
the GRE-containing region was deleted or when a point mutation was
introduced into the GRE. Yoshida et al. (2004) concluded that
glucocorticoid-induced upregulation of ABCA3 expression in vivo is
mediated by transcriptional activation through the GRE in the promoter,
and suggested that ABCA3 plays an important role in the formation of
pulmonary surfactant, probably by transporting lipids such as
cholesterol.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 16 of 21 racially and ethnically diverse infants with severe neonatal
respiratory distress and surfactant deficiency (610921), Shulenin et al.
(2004) identified mutations in the ABCA3 gene (see
601615.0001-601615.0006). They detected nonsense and frameshift
mutations, as well as mutations in highly conserved residues and in
splice sites of the gene. In 5 consanguineous families with mutations,
each pair of sibs was homozygous for the same mutation and each mutation
was found in only 1 family. Most of the infants died within 1 month
after birth, although 1 child who was heterozygous was still alive at 6
years of age.

In a male infant who died in the neonatal period from surfactant-related
respiratory failure, Kunig et al. (2007) identified homozygosity for a
missense mutation in the ABCA3 gene (601615.0007).

Kaltenborn et al. (2012) studied the effects of 2 clinically relevant
ABCA3 mutations, E292V and Q215K, alone and in combination with
respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. The authors noted that
E292V has a prevalence of 1:277 in the United States and thus is the
most common ABCA3 mutation reported in children (Garmany et al., 2008);
the Q215K mutation was reported in a neonate who died of respiratory
distress (Brasch et al., 2006). After stable transfection into A549 lung
epithelial cells, the ABCA3 mutations strongly impaired expression of
the alveolar type II differentiation marker SPC (178620) and the
epithelial cell adhesion proteins E-cadherin (192090) and zonula
occludens-1 (601009). Concurrently, cells expressing the ABCA3 mutations
acquired mesenchymal features as evidenced by increased expression of
SNAI1 (604238), MMP2 (120360), and TGFB1 (190180), and elevated
phosphorylation of SRC (190090). Infection with the most common viral
respiratory pathogen in small children, RSV, potentiated the transition
from epithelial to mesenchymal characteristics as well as a morphologic
shift to a mesenchymal phenotype. Kaltenborn et al. (2012) suggested
that impairment of epithelial function might be a mechanism by which
ABCA3 mutations cause interstitial lung disease.

gln1591-to-pro (Q1591P) mutation. The patient was still alive at 6 years

residue is within the N-terminal ATP-binding domain and is conserved in
the mammalian and fish ABCA3 genes as well as almost all other members
of ABC subfamily A. The corresponding residue is mutated in the ABCA1

612699	TITLE *612699 RIMS-BINDING PROTEIN 3; RIMBP3
;;RIMBP3A;;
RIMBP3.1;;
KIAA1666
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from size-fractionated human brain
libraries, Hirosawa et al. (2001) cloned RIMBP3, which they designated
KIAA1666. The predicted full-length protein contains 1,560 amino acids.

Mittelstaedt and Schoch (2007) cloned mouse Rimbp3, and by database
analysis, they identified 3 human RIMBP3 genes, RIMBP3, RIMBP3B
(612700), and RIMBP3C (612701), which share 99% nucleotide identity.
Each of the deduced human RIMBP3 proteins contains 1,639 amino acids and
has a calculated molecular mass of 180 kD. RIMBP3 has a central SRC
(190090) homology-3 (SH3) domain, followed by 2 tandem fibronectin
(135600)-like 3 (FN3) domains, and 2 C-terminal SH3 domains.
Mittelstaedt and Schoch (2007) noted that all other members of the RIMBP
family have 3 tandem FN3 domains. The N-terminal region of RIMBP3 is
rich in arginine, glutamic acid, aspartic acid, serine, and proline.
Quantitative real-time PCR of mouse tissues detected ubiquitous Rimbp3
expression, with the highest level in testis. Rimbp3 showed low uniform
expression in all mouse brain regions examined and in embryonic mouse
brain.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hirosawa et al. (2001) determined that the coding region of the RIMBP3
gene spans about 5.5 kb.

Mittelstaedt and Schoch (2007) found that each of the 3 RIMBP3 genes
contains a single exon. RIMBP3 spans about 6.1 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Hirosawa et al. (2001) mapped the RIMBP3
gene to chromosome 22q.

Mittelstaedt and Schoch (2007) mapped the 3 RIMBP3 genes to a 1.4-Mb
region of chromosome 22q11.21. They mapped the single mouse Rimbp3 gene
to chromosome 16A3.

EVOLUTION

By database analysis, Mittelstaedt and Schoch (2007) found that the
RIMBP3 gene is present only in therian mammals. For further information
on the evolution of the RIMBP gene family, see RIMBP1 (BZRAP1; 610764).

;;GP1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

To identify genes induced in monocytes by interferon-gamma (IFNG;
147570), Senju and Nishimura (1997) carried out PCR-based cDNA
subtraction and subsequent differential display on mRNA isolated from a
human monocytic leukemia cell line, THP-1. They detected a novel gene
encoding a protein bearing GTP-binding motifs characteristic of G
proteins. They also identified the mouse homolog of this gene and
designated the gene GP1. The predicted 584-amino acid human protein is
97% identical to the mouse homolog. Northern blot analysis revealed that
the 4-kb GP1 mRNA was expressed in mouse brain, thymus, lung, and
kidney, but was rarely expressed in liver.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid and genomic sequence analyses, Kudo et al. (2000)
mapped the GTPBP1 gene to chromosome 22q12-q13.1. By FISH, they mapped
the mouse gene to chromosome 15E3.

611679	TITLE *611679 F-BOX AND WD40 DOMAIN PROTEIN 10; FBXW10
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the F-box protein family, such as FBXW10, are characterized
by an approximately 40-amino acid F-box motif. SCF complexes, formed by
SKP1 (601434), cullin (see CUL1; 603134), and F-box proteins, act as
protein-ubiquitin ligases. F-box proteins interact with SKP1 through the
F box, and they interact with ubiquitination targets through other
protein interaction domains (Jin et al., 2004).

CLONING

Jin et al. (2004) reported that the FBXW10 protein contains an F box in
its N-terminal half, followed by 5 central WD40 repeats.

MAPPING

Jin et al. (2004) stated that the FBXW10 gene maps to chromosome 17p12
in human and to chromosome 11B2 in mouse.

300617	TITLE *300617 BRCA1/BRCA2-CONTAINING COMPLEX, SUBUNIT 3; BRCC3
;;C6.1A;;
BRCC36
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Kenwrick et al., 1992 identified cDNA clones corresponding to the BRCC3
and MTCP1 (300116) genes, which they called C6.1A and C6.1B,
respectively. The C6.1A gene was highly conserved between species and
expressed abundantly in many human and mouse tissues.

Dong et al. (2003) determined that the BRCC3 gene encodes a 316-amino
acid protein with a molecular mass of 36 kD. BRCC3 shares sequence
homology with the JAMM domain of POH1 (PSMD14; 607173) and COPS5
(604850).

GENE FUNCTION

Dong et al. (2003) demonstrated that in human cell lines BRCC3 and BRE
(610497) are components of a holoenzyme complex containing BRCA1
(113705), BRCA2 (600185), BARD1 (601593), and RAD51 (179617), which they
called the BRCA1- and BRCA2-containing complex (BRCC). The complex
showed UBC5 (see UBE2D1; 602961)-dependent ubiquitin E3 ligase activity.
Inclusion of BRE and BRCC3 enhanced ubiquitination by the complex, and
cancer-associated truncations in BRCA1 reduced the association of BRE
and BRCC3 with the complex. RNA interference of BRE and BRCC3 in HeLa
cells increased cell sensitivity to ionizing radiation and resulted in a
defect in G2/M checkpoint arrest. Dong et al. (2003) concluded that BRCC
is a ubiquitin E3 ligase that enhances cellular survival following DNA
damage.

Okamoto et al. (2013) addressed the molecular properties of TRF2
(602027) that are both necessary and sufficient to protect chromosome
ends in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, and stated that their data
supported a 2-step mechanism for TRF2-mediated end protection. First,
the dimerization domain of TRF2 is required to inhibit ATM (607585)
activation, the key initial step involved in the activation of a DNA
damage response (DDR). Next, TRF2 independently suppresses the
propagation of DNA damage signaling downstream of ATM activation. This
novel modulation of the DDR at telomeres occurs at the level of the E3
ubiquitin ligase RNF168 (612688). Inhibition of RNF168 at telomeres
involves the deubiquitinating enzyme BRCC3 and the ubiquitin ligase UBR5
(608413), and is sufficient to suppress chromosome end-to-end fusions.
Okamoto et al. (2013) concluded that this 2-step mechanism for
TRF2-mediated end protection helped to explain the apparent paradox of
frequent localization of DDR proteins at functional telomeres without
concurrent induction of detrimental DNA repair activities.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid analysis, Kenwrick et al. (1992) mapped the BRCC3
gene to chromosome Xq28.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of 3 unrelated families with an X-linked recessive
syndromic form of moyamoya disease (MYMY4; 300845), Miskinyte et al.
(2011) identified 3 different deletions on chromosome Xq28. The critical
region of overlap was a 3.4-kb region including exon 1 of the
MTCP1/MTCP1NB gene (300116) and the first 3 exons of the BRCC3 gene,
resulting in loss of BRCC3 and MTCP1NB expression in patient
lymphoblastoid cell lines. Morpholino knockdown of Brcc3 in zebrafish
resulted in defective angiogenesis that could be rescued by endothelial
expression of Brcc3, suggesting that loss of BRCC3 function was
responsible for the human disorder. The phenotype is a multisystem
disorder characterized by moyamoya disease, short stature,
hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, and facial dysmorphism. Other variable
features include dilated cardiomyopathy and premature graying of the
hair. Miskinyte et al. (2011) noted that some of the features of the
disorder were reminiscent of chromosome breakage syndromes.

606044	TITLE *606044 SJOGREN SYNDROME/SCLERODERMA AUTOANTIGEN 1; SSSCA1
;;CENTROMERIC AUTOANTIGEN, 27-KD
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The centromere plays an essential role in the pairing and partitioning
of replicated chromosomes in mitosis and meiosis and is recognized by
anticentromere antibodies in patients with autoimmune disorders. By
immunoscreening a cDNA library with serum from a Sjogren syndrome
(270150) patient with anticentromere antibodies, Muro et al. (1998)
isolated a cDNA encoding SSSCA1, which they referred to as p27 due to
its molecular mass in Western blot analysis. The deduced 199-amino acid,
leucine-rich protein has an N terminus with many charged residues and a
potential phosphorylation site; 2 short proline-rich stretches; and a
potential C-terminal phosphorylation site. Immunofluorescence analysis
failed to demonstrate centromeric or other staining. Immunoblot analysis
with recombinant SSSCA1 determined that approximately 2% of patients
with anticentromere antibodies had anti-SSSCA1 antibodies, while less
than 1% of autoimmune patients without anticentromere antibodies had
anti-SSSCA1 antibodies. All 5 seropositive patients had a diagnosis of
scleroderma (see 181750) or Sjogren syndrome with internal organ
involvement.

;;PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE, MAGNESIUM-DEPENDENT, 1, ALPHA ISOFORM;;
PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE 2C, ALPHA ISOFORM; PP2CA;;
PP2C-ALPHA
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

PPM1A is a serine/threonine protein phosphatase that is essential for
regulating cellular stress responses in eukaryotes. For further
background information on serine/threonine protein phosphatases, see
605119.

CLONING

By screening a human teratocarcinoma cDNA library with rat Pp2c-alpha as
the probe, Mann et al. (1992) cloned the human counterpart, PPM1A, which
they called PP2C-alpha. The PPM1A cDNA encodes a predicted 382-amino
acid peptide that shares 99.7% amino acid identity with rabbit
Pp2c-alpha.

In a genetic screen to identify protein phosphatases that negatively
regulate the p38 (600289) and JNK (see 601158) stress-activated MAPK
cascades, Takekawa et al. (1998) obtained a PP2C-alpha cDNA, which they
initially called MC4, that encodes a 324-amino acid peptide. The authors
hypothesized that MC4 is an alternative splicing product of PP2C-alpha.
The 2 proteins, which they termed PP2C-alpha-1 (382 amino acids) and
PP2C-alpha-2 (324 amino acids), differ at the C terminus. Northern blot
analysis detected 2.8- and 4.4-kb transcripts, which correspond to
PP2C-alpha-1 and PP2C-alpha-2, respectively. Both transcripts were
expressed at high levels in heart, placenta, skeletal muscle, and
pancreas, and the 4.4-kb transcript (PP2C-alpha-2) was detected in
brain.

GENE FUNCTION

Using immunohistochemical analysis, Das et al. (1996) detected PPM1A in
both the cytoplasm and nucleus of mammalian cells, consistent with a
role in dephosphorylating components of stress-activated pathways.

By expressing PPM1A in mammalian cells, Takekawa et al. (1998)
demonstrated that PPM1A inhibits the activation of the stress-responsive
p38 and JNK MAPK cascades. Their in vivo and in vitro observations
indicated that PPM1A dephosphorylates and inactivates MAPKKs (MKK6
(601254) and SEK1 (601335)) and a MAPK (p38) in the stress-responsive
MAPK cascades. Using coimmunoprecipitation assays, the authors
demonstrated that PPM1A directly interacts with p38.

A key step in TGF-beta (TGFB1; 190180) signaling is ligand-induced
phosphorylation of receptor-activated SMADs (see SMAD2; 601366). Using a
functional genomic approach, Lin et al. (2006) identified human PPM1A as
a SMAD phosphatase. PPM1A dephosphorylated and promoted nuclear export
of TGF-beta-activated SMAD2 and SMAD3 (603109) in human cells. Ectopic
expression of PPM1A abolished TGF-beta-induced antiproliferative and
transcriptional responses, whereas depletion of PPM1A enhanced TGF-beta
signaling in human and other mammalian cells. In zebrafish,
Smad-antagonizing activity of Ppm1a was observed during Nodal
(601265)-dependent early embryogenesis. Lin et al. (2006) concluded that
PPM1A plays a critical role in TGF-beta signaling through
dephosphorylation of SMAD2 and SMAD3.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Das et al. (1996) determined the crystal structure of PPM1A, which they
called PP2C. The structure revealed a novel protein fold with a
catalytic domain composed of a central beta sandwich that binds 2
manganese ions, which is surrounded by alpha helices. The authors stated
that the protein architecture and deduced catalytic mechanism are
similar to the PP1, PP2A, and PP2B family of protein ser/thr
phosphatases.

REDUCED PIGMENTATION, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF; RP;;
HPS8 GENE; HPS8
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

BLOC1S3 is a component of the ubiquitously expressed BLOC1 multisubunit
protein complex. BLOC1 is required for normal biogenesis of specialized
organelles of the endosomal-lysosomal system, such as melanosomes and
platelet dense granules (Starcevic and Dell'Angelica, 2004).

CLONING

Using the BLOC1 subunit pallidin (PLDN; 604310) as bait in a yeast
2-hybrid screen of a HeLa cell cDNA library, Starcevic and Dell'Angelica
(2004) cloned BLOC1S3, which they called BLOS3. The deduced BLOS3
protein has a calculated molecular mass of 21.3 kD. However, Western
blot analysis detected endogenous HeLa cell BLOS3 at an apparent
molecular mass of 32 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

By mass spectrometry of BLOC1 proteins purified from bovine liver, mouse
liver, and HeLa cells, Starcevic and Dell'Angelica (2004) identified
BLOS3 as a subunit of BLOC1. Other BLOC1 subunits identified were
pallidin, muted (607289), dysbindin (DTNBP1; 607145), cappuccino
(605695), snapin (SNAPAP; 607007), BLOC1S1 (601444), and BLOC1S2
(609768). Coimmunoprecipitation and yeast 2-hybrid analyses confirmed
that these proteins interact within the BLOC1 complex.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the BLOC1S3
gene to chromosome 19 (TMAP RH48388). Starcevic and Dell'Angelica (2004)
mapped the mouse Bloc1s3 gene to chromosome 7A2.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Using an autozygosity mapping strategy, Morgan et al. (2006) mapped
Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS8; 614077) in a large consanguineous
family to 19q13. Affected individuals displayed features of incomplete
oculocutaneous albinism and platelet dysfunction. Skin biopsy
demonstrated abnormal aggregates of melanosomes within basal epidermal
keratinocytes. Morgan et al. (2006) noted that the human homolog of the
rp gene, which is disrupted in a mouse model of Hermansky-Pudlak
syndrome, resides in this region. Sequencing of the single exon of the
BLOC1S gene demonstrated a 1-bp frameshift deletion, 448delC
(609762.0001).

ANIMAL MODEL

Starcevic and Dell'Angelica (2004) determined that the reduced
pigmentation (rp) mutation in mice, a model of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome
(HPS; 203300), results from a 1-bp substitution (238C-T) in the Blos3
gene. The mutation introduces a premature termination codon (Q80X) in rp
mice. Mutant mRNA was not subject to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. The
rp mutation did not completely disrupt BLOC1 assembly.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HERMANSKY-PUDLAK SYNDROME 8
BLOC1S3, 1-BP DEL, 448C

In a man of Pakistani extraction with Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS8;
614077) whose parents were first cousins, Morgan et al. (2006) described
a 1-bp frameshift mutation in the BLOC1S3 gene (448delC). He was
referred at the age of 21 years for genetic counseling for
'oculocutaneous albinism.' He was born with silvery hair, which slowly
darkened to a 'gold' color, and he had hazel eyes and pale skin that
became red but did not tan in the sun. There was no history of bleeding
or recurrent infections. There was generalized hypopigmentation and
reduced visual acuity with pendular nystagmus and iris
transillumination. Visual evoked responses demonstrated increased
chiasmal decussation. Other affected members of the family carrying the
mutation had histories of easy bruising and prolonged bleeding after
cuts, as well as frequent nosebleeds.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using the yeast 2-hybrid method to screen a human hepatocyte cDNA
library with the small subunit of DNA polymerase delta (POLD2; 600815)
as bait, He et al. (2001) isolated a cDNA encoding potassium channel
tetramerization domain containing-13 (KCTD13). KCTD13 encodes a
predicted 329-amino acid protein of 36.4 kD molecular mass, and shows
62% amino acid identity with B12 (TNFAIP1; 191161), a TNF (191160)
early-response gene. Northern blot analysis showed ubiquitous expression
of a 1.8-kb KCTD13 transcript, with highest expression levels in liver
and kidney.

GENE FUNCTION

By immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy, He et al. (2001)
demonstrated that KCTD13 is a nuclear protein that colocalizes with PCNA
(176740) at replication foci. They showed that recombinant KCTD13 binds
to POLD2 and to PCNA in vitro, and GST pull-down assays demonstrated
that KCTD13 binds these 2 proteins simultaneously. KCTD13 stimulates the
polymerase activity of POLD2 when PCNA is present. He et al. (2001)
identified a putative PCNA-binding motif at the C terminus of KCTD13
(QTKV-EFP), and Far Western analysis confirmed that a peptide of this
motif binds PCNA. Similar to that of TNFAIP1, KCTD13 expression is
induced by TNF-alpha and by IL6 (147620).

MAPPING

Using FISH, He et al. (2001) mapped the KCTD13 gene to 16p11.2.

610257	TITLE *610257 SEC31, YEAST, HOMOLOG OF, A; SEC31A
;;SEC31-LIKE 1; SEC31L1;;
KIAA0905
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SEC31A is a subunit of coat protein complex II (COPII)-coated vesicles,
which are essential for secretion (Jin et al., 2012).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) cloned SEC31L1, which they designated
KIAA0905. The deduced protein contains 1,220 amino acids. RT-PCR
detected moderate expression in all adult and fetal tissues and specific
brain regions examined.

By searching EST databases for sequences similar to yeast Sec31,
followed by screening a pancreas cDNA library, Tang et al. (2000) cloned
SEC31L1, which they called SEC31A. The deduced 1,218-amino acid protein
shares 25.8% identity with yeast Sec31. It contains 5 WD40 or WD40-like
repeats at its N terminus and a proline-rich region in its C-terminal
half. Northern blot analysis detected a 4-kb transcript that was
abundantly and ubiquitously expressed. In rat kidney cells, Sec31a
colocalized with Sec13 (SEC13L1; 600152) in vesicular-tubular structures
characteristic of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) exit sites.

GENE FUNCTION

By immunostaining for Sec31a in intact and permeabilized rat kidney
cells, Tang et al. (2000) found that Sec31a was not tightly associated
with the membrane. Binding of Sec31a to specific membrane structures was
restored by incubating washed cells with cytosol, indicating that Sec31a
was recruited to membranes. The membrane association of Sec31a was
greatly enhanced in the presence of a nonhydrolyzable GTP analog. Tang
et al. (2000) demonstrated that Sec31A and Sec13 coimmunoprecipitated
and that the proteins existed in a 600- to 700-kD complex.
Immunodepletion studies showed that rat Sec31a was required for
ER-to-Golgi vesicular transport.

Jin et al. (2012) found that monoubiquitination of Sec31 in mouse
embryonic stem cells by Klhl12 (614522) and the Cul3 (603136) E3
ubiquitin ligase complex was required for COPII vesicle expansion to
accommodate large cargo proteins, such as procollagens (see 120150). A
Sec31-binding mutant of Klhl12 neither colocalized with Sec31 at
intracellular vesicles nor induced formation of large vesicles.
Disruption of KLHL12-CUL3 function in human HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells
impaired COPII vesicle expansion and collagen export, but it had no
effect on export of smaller cargo by small COPII vesicles. Jin et al.
(2012) concluded that KLHL12-CUL3 monoubiquitination of SEC31 is
required for COPII vesicle expansion to accommodate large or bulky cargo
molecules.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the SEC31L1
gene to chromosome 4.

158381	TITLE *158381 ECOTROPIC VIRAL INTEGRATION SITE 2B; EVI2B
;;MURINE MYELOID LEUKEMIA-ASSOCIATED GENE EVI2B, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF;;
EVDB
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Two translocation breakpoints that interrupt the NF1 gene (613113) in
patients with neurofibromatosis I (162200) flank a 60-kb segment of DNA
that contains EVI2A (158380). Cawthon et al. (1991) described a second
locus, EVI2B, also located between the 2 NF1 translocation breakpoints.
Full-length cDNAs from the EVI2B locus detected a 2.1-kb transcript in
bone marrow, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and fibroblasts.
Sequencing studies predicted an EVI2B protein of 448 amino acids that is
proline-rich and contains an N-terminal signal peptide, an extracellular
domain with 4 potential glycosylation sites, a single hydrophobic
transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic hydrophilic domain.

GENE STRUCTURE

Cawthon et al. (1991) determined that the EVI2B locus lies within the
same intron of the NF1 gene as EVI2A and contains a 57-bp 5-prime exon
that is noncoding, an 8-kb intron, and a 2,078-bp 3-prime exon that
includes the entire open reading frame. EVI2B is transcribed in the same
direction as EVI2A; its 5-prime exon lies only 4 kb downstream from the
3-prime exon of the EVI2A locus. In the mouse, the 5-prime exon of the
homologous gene, Evi2b, lies approximately 2.8 kb from the 3-prime end
of Evi2a, in the midst of a cluster of viral integration sites
identified in retrovirus-induced myeloid tumors; thus, EVI2B may
function as an oncogene in these tumors.

MAPPING

Viskochil et al. (1991) reported that 3 genes, EVI2A, EVI2B, and OMGP
(164345), are embedded within an intron of NF1 on chromosome 17q11.2.
All 3 genes had the same transcriptional orientation, which was opposite
to that of the NF1 gene.

601618	TITLE *601618 SRY-BOX 18; SOX18
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The testis-determining gene SRY (480000) encodes a transcription factor
characterized by a DNA-binding motif known as the HMG (high mobility
group) domain. The SOX gene family consists of genes related to SRY,
with a sequence identity of more than 60% to the SRY HMG box. See
600898.

CLONING

Greenfield et al. (1996) described a novel member of the mouse Sox gene
family, Sox18, which is transcribed in adult lung and in cardiac and
skeletal muscle. They reported that the Sox18 protein binds the sequence
AACAAAG in vitro and that it is capable of transactivating gene
expression. Pennisi et al. (2000) found that Sox18 is expressed in the
developing vascular endothelium and hair follicles in mouse embryos.

By EST database searching for sequences with an HMG-box, followed by
3-prime and 5-prime RACE, Azuma et al. (2000) identified a partial cDNA
sequence which they then used to screen a human heart cDNA library. They
isolated a cDNA clone encoding a deduced 384-amino acid protein that
shares 83% identity with the mouse Sox18 protein. Northern blot analysis
showed that a 1.9-kb SOX18 transcript is predominantly expressed in the
heart, although weak signals are seen in brain, liver, testis, and
leukocytes.

MAPPING

On the basis of linkage analysis, Greenfield et al. (1996) mapped the
Sox18 gene to distal mouse chromosome 2. They noted that distal mouse
chromosome 2 includes 1 of 10 known imprinted regions in the mouse. By
homology, the human SOX18 gene would map to chromosome 20q. By PCR-based
analyses with both a human/rodent monochromosomal hybrid cell panel and
a radiation hybrid panel, Azuma et al. (2000) mapped the SOX18 gene to
20q13.33. Pennisi et al. (2000) also confirmed the assignment of the
SOX18 gene to 20q13.3 by radiation hybrid analysis.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Using microsatellite analysis in 3 families with
hypotrichosis-lymphedema-telangiectasia syndrome (HLTS; 607823), Irrthum
et al. (2003) excluded the VEGFR3 (136352) and FOXC2 (602402) genes,
which are related to other disorders involving lymphedema, as candidate
genes. They identified the murine 'ragged' phenotype, which is caused by
mutation in the Sox18 gene, as a likely counterpart of HLTS because it
presents a combination of hair and cardiovascular anomalies, including
symptoms of lymphatic dysfunction. By sequencing the SOX18 gene in the 3
HLTS families, they identified homozygous missense mutations
(601618.0001 and 601618.0002) in affected members of 2 consanguineous
families and a heterozygous nonsense mutation (601618.0003) in an
affected child and his brother, who died in utero with hydrops fetalis,
of a nonconsanguineous family. The nonsense mutation, which truncated
the SOX18 protein in its transactivation domain, was not found in
genomic DNA from either parent and was thought to constitute a de novo
germline mutation.

ANIMAL MODEL

Greenfield et al. (1996) noted that Sox18 is a candidate for 2 mouse
mutants, 'ragged' and 'wasting.' 'Ragged' heterozygous mice are viable
and healthy with thin ragged coats comprised of guard hairs and awls.
Homozygotes almost completely lack vibrissae and coat hairs, display
generalized edema and cyanosis, rarely survive past weaning, and,
depending on the genetic background, may have an accumulation of chyle
in the peritoneum. Ragged(J) mice have a phenotype indistinguishable
from that of ragged mice. The ragged mutation is semidominant. Pennisi
et al. (2000) identified mutations in the Sox18 gene that underlie the
cardiovascular and hair follicle defects in ragged mice. The ragged
phenotype is caused by deletion of a cytosine at nucleotide 960 of the
murine Sox18 gene; ragged(J) is caused by deletion of a guanine at
nucleotide 959. Fusion proteins containing these mutations lacked the
ability to activate transcription relative to wildtype controls in an in
vitro assay.

Francois et al. (2008) used molecular, cellular, and genetic assays in
mice to show that Sox18 acts as a molecular switch to induce
differentiation of lymphatic endothelial cells. Sox18 is expressed in a
subset of cardinal vein cells that later coexpress Prox1 (610546) and
migrate to form lymphatic vessels. Sox18 directly activates Prox1
transcription by binding to its proximal promoter. Overexpression of
Sox18 in blood vascular endothelial cells induced them to express Prox1
and other lymphatic endothelial markers, while Sox18-null embryos showed
a complete blockade of lymphatic endothelial cell differentiation from
the cardinal vein. Francois et al. (2008) concluded that their findings
demonstrated a critical role for Sox18 in developmental
lymphangiogenesis, and suggested new avenues to investigate for
therapeutic management of human lymphangiopathies.

In embryos of the naturally occurring Sox18-mutant mouse strain
ragged-opossum (RaOp), Downes et al. (2009) demonstrated that early
genesis and patterning of vasculature was unimpaired, but surface
capillaries became enlarged from 12.5 days postcoitum, and that embryos
developed massive surface hemorrhage by 14.5 days postcoitum. Large
focal breaches in the endothelial barrier were observed, in addition to
endothelial hyperplasia associated with impaired pericyte recruitment to
the microvasculature. Expression of the genes encoding the endothelial
factors MMP7 (178990), IL7R (146661), and N-cadherin (CDH2; 114020) was
reduced in RaOp embryos, suggesting that these may be downstream targets
of SOX18. Downes et al. (2009) hypothesized that vascular anomalies in
HLTS arise from defects in regulation of genes required for the
acquisition of structural integrity during microvascular maturation.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HYPOTRICHOSIS-LYMPHEDEMA-TELANGIECTASIA SYNDROME
SOX18, ALA104PRO

In a family reported by Devriendt et al. (2002) in which a male and
female child of first-cousin Belgian parents were affected with
hypotrichosis-lymphedema-telangiectasia syndrome (607823), Irrthum et
al. (2003) identified homozygosity for a 455G-C transversion in the
SOX18 gene, resulting in an ala104-to-pro (A104P) substitution. The
mutation was present in heterozygous state in the unaffected parents.

In a 12-year-old Turkish girl with
hypotrichosis-lymphedema-telangiectasia syndrome (607823) described by
Glade et al. (2001), Irrthum et al. (2003) identified a homozygous
428T-A transversion in the SOX18 gene, resulting in a trp95-to-arg
(W95R) substitution. Her parents were first cousins.

.0003
HYPOTRICHOSIS-LYMPHEDEMA-TELANGIECTASIA SYNDROME
SOX18, CYS240TER

In a boy with hypotrichosis-lymphedema-telangiectasia syndrome (607823)
and in tissue from his deceased brother, who died in utero at 30 weeks'
gestation, Irrthum et al. (2003) identified a heterozygous 865C-A
transversion in the SOX18 gene, resulting in a cys240-to-ter (C240X)
substitution. The mutation was not present in the genomic DNA of the
unaffected nonconsanguineous parents.

608387	TITLE *608387 ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 213; ZNF213
;;CR53
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

C2H2 zinc finger proteins, such as ZNF213, have bipartite structures in
which one domain binds DNA or RNA and the other modulates target gene
expression.

CLONING

By sequencing candidate genes within the FMF locus (249100) on
chromosome 16, PCR of fetal brain, fetal liver, and lymph node cDNA
libraries, and screening a peripheral blood leukocyte cDNA library, Chen
et al. (1999) cloned ZNF213. The deduced 424-amino acid protein contains
an N-terminal leucine-rich domain, followed by a Kruppel-associated box
and C-terminal zinc fingers. Northern blot analysis detected a 3.8-kb
transcript in all tissues examined. Highest expression was detected in
testis, followed by ovary, small intestine, prostate, spleen, thymus,
mucosal lining of colon, and peripheral blood lymphocytes.

GENE STRUCTURE

Chen et al. (1999) determined that the ZNF213 gene contains 7 exons and
spans about 8.0 kb. The 5-prime untranslated region is GC rich.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Bernot et al. (1998) mapped the ZNF213
gene, which they designated CR53, to chromosome 16p13.3. The gene is
oriented with its 5-prime end toward the telomere. Chen et al. (1999)
determined that the ZNF213 gene lies within a ZNF gene cluster that
includes ZNF263 (604191) and ZNF174 (603900).

601509	TITLE *601509 GAMMA-GLUTAMYL HYDROLASE; GGH
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Gamma-glutamyl hydrolase (EC 3.4.19.9) catalyzes the hydrolysis of
folylpoly-gamma-glutamates and antifolylpoly-gamma-glutamates by the
removal of gamma-linked polyglutamates and glutamate.

CLONING

Yao et al. (1996) cloned and characterized a cDNA for human GGH. The
cDNA encodes a 318-amino acid protein with a deduced amino acid sequence
67% identical to that of the rat enzyme. The N-terminal 24 residues are
likely a leader sequence that mediates translocation of GGH into the
endoplasmic reticulum for secretion. GGH also contains 4 potential
N-glycosylation sites. Western blot analysis detected GGH at an apparent
molecular mass of about 35 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

Rhee et al. (1995) determined that, unlike the rat enzyme, human GGH
showed higher activity toward the pentaglutamate derivative of
methotrexate and had little activity against the diglutamate derivative.
More than 60% of the total GGH activity was secreted into the medium of
the 5 tumor cell lines examined.

Yao et al. (1996) characterized the hydrolysis of methotrexate
pentaglutamate by GGH. GGH primarily functioned as an exopeptidase,
initially producing methotrexate tetraglutamate, followed by the
triglutamate, and then the diglutamate and methotrexate. On the other
hand, rat Ggh showed exclusively endopeptidase activity, cleaving the
innermost gamma-glutamyl linkage, resulting in methotrexate
monoglutamate as the only pteroyl-containing product.

Cheng et al. (2005) used polymorphisms in the genes encoding thiopurine
S-methyltransferase (TPMT; 187680), GGH, and the reduced folate carrier
(SLC19A1; 600424) to assess the nature of chromosomal acquisition and
its influence on genotype-phenotype concordance in cancer cells. TPMT
and GGH activities in somatic cells were concordant with germline
genotypes, whereas activities in leukemia cells were determined by
chromosomal number and whether the acquired chromosomes contained a
wildtype or variant allele. Leukemia cells that had acquired an
additional chromosome containing a wildtype TPMT or GGH allele had
significantly lower accumulation of thioguanine nucleotides or
methotrexate polyglutamates, respectively. Among these genes, there was
a considerable number of acquired chromosomes with wildtype and variant
alleles. Therefore, chromosomal gain can alter the concordance of
germline genotype and cancer cell phenotypes, indicating that
allele-specific quantitative genotyping may be required to define cancer
pharmacogenomics unequivocally.

GENE STRUCTURE

Yin et al. (1999) determined that the GGH gene contains 9 exons and
spans 24 kb. The sequence upstream of exon 1 consists of a promoter-like
GC-rich region and a number of putative cis active elements, including
Sp1 (189906), AP1 (165160), and MZF1 (194550) sites; there is no TATA
sequence.

MAPPING

Yin et al. (1999) stated that the GGH gene maps to chromosome
8q12.23-q13.1.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Gamma-glutamyl hydrolase catalyzes degradation of the active
polyglutamates of natural folates and the antifolate methotrexate (MTX).
Cheng et al. (2006) found that GGH activity is directly related to GGH
mRNA expression in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells in patients
with a wildtype germline GGH genotype. They identified 2 CpG islands in
the region extending from the GGH promoter through the first exon and
into intron 1 and showed that methylation of both CpG islands in the GGH
promoter (seen in leukemia cells from approximately 15% of patients with
nonhyperdiploid B-lineage ALL) is associated with significantly reduced
GGH mRNA expression and catalytic activity and with significantly higher
accumulation of MTX polyglutamates in ALL cells. Furthermore,
methylation of 1 CpG island was leukemia-cell specific and had a
pronounced effect on GGH expression, whereas methylation of the second
was common in leukemia cells and normal leukocytes but did not
significantly alter GGH expression. These findings indicated that GGH
activity in human leukemia cells is regulated by epigenetic changes, in
addition to previously recognized genetic polymorphisms and karyotypic
abnormalities, which collectively determine interindividual differences
in GGH activity and influence the accumulation of MTX polyglutamates in
leukemia cells.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) cloned ZHX2, which they designated
KIAA0854. The deduced 837-amino acid protein shares about 40% identity
with mouse Zhx1 (604764). RT-PCR ELISA detected expression in all
tissues examined, with highest levels in ovary, followed by lung, heart,
kidney, brain, and liver. Intermediate expression was detected in
pancreas, spleen, testis, and skeletal muscle.

Kawata et al. (2003) cloned rat Zhx2 and, by database analysis,
identified human ZHX2. The deduced human protein has a calculated
molecular mass of 92 kD. It contains 2 C2H2-type zinc finger motifs and
5 homeodomains (HD), with a unique proline-rich region between HD1 and
HD2. Northern blot analysis detected a 4.4-kb transcript expressed at
variable levels in all tissues examined.

Kawata et al. (2003) cloned mouse Zhx2. The mouse and human ZHX2
proteins share 87% amino acid identity. Northern blot analysis detected
Zhx2 expression in all mouse tissues examined.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis and in vitro pull-down assays, Kawata et al.
(2003) demonstrated a direct interaction between ZHX1 and ZHX2. ZHX2
could also form homodimers in vivo and in vitro. Both interactions
required an extensive region around HD1. ZHX2 also interacted with the
activation domain of NFYA (189903), and this interaction required the
HD1 and HD2 region of ZHX2. Immunoprecipitation analysis detected an
endogenous interaction between ZHX2 and NFYA in human embryonic kidney
cells. Furthermore, ZHX2 was able to repress reporter activity driven by
a CDC25C (157680) promoter, which contains 3 NFY-binding sequences.

GENE STRUCTURE

Perincheri et al. (2005) determined that the mouse Zhx2 gene contains 4
exons, with the entire coding region located within exon 3. They stated
that the human ZHX2 gene has the same structure.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Kawata et al. (2003) mapped the ZHX2 gene
to chromosome 8q, 396 kb from the ZHX1 gene. The 2 genes are transcribed
in opposite directions.

By genomic sequence analysis, Perincheri et al. (2005) mapped the mouse
Zhx2 gene to a region of chromosome 15 that shows homology of synteny to
human chromosome 8q. In the mouse, the Zhx1 and Zhx2 genes are about 300
kb apart.

ANIMAL MODEL

Vogt et al. (1987) identified in the mouse the transacting locus termed
raf. Analysis of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP; 104150) expression in livers of
embryo aggregation chimeras derived from mice of different raf genotypes
showed that the product of the raf locus is expressed as a
hepatocyte-autonomous function that acts in trans to regulate the level
of Afp mRNA.

The AFP and H19 (103290) genes are transcribed at high levels in
mammalian fetal liver, but they are rapidly repressed postnatally.
However, BALB/cJ mice show hereditary persistence of Afp and H19
expression into adulthood. The increase in adult serum Afp is due
primarily to high Afp expression in liver, and the trait is transmitted
as a single autosomal dominant locus, referred to as Afr1 or Raf. By
high-resolution mapping, Perincheri et al. (2005) identified the Zhx2
gene within the Afr1 interval on chromosome 15. They determined that
persistent expression of Afp and H19 in BALB/cJ mice is due to the
insertion of a murine endogenous retrovirus within the first intron of
the Zhx2 gene, which leads predominantly to expression of an aberrant
transcript that no longer encodes a functional transcriptional
repressor. Liver-specific overexpression of a Zhx2 transgene restored
wildtype H19 repression on a BALB/cJ background.

607117	TITLE *607117 MCPH1 GENE; MCPH1
;;MICROCEPHALIN;;
BRCT-REPEAT INHIBITOR OF TERT EXPRESSION 1; BRIT1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The MCPH1 gene encodes a regulator of chromosome condensation (Trimborn
et al., 2004).

CLONING

To identify the causative gene in a form of primary microcephaly linked
to chromosome 8p23 (MCPH1; 251200), Jackson et al. (2002) sought a
founder effect in 2 linked families and then sequenced positional
candidates. Of 2 genes identified in the MCPH1 interval, angiopoietin-2
(ANGPT2; 601922) showed no changes. However, the other gene, which was
previously uncharacterized, showed a nonsense mutation (607117.0001) in
both families sharing the ancestral 8p23 haplotype. Jackson et al.
(2002) termed the predicted 835-amino acid protein encoded by this gene
microcephalin. Microcephalin contains 3 BRCA1 (113705) C-terminal (BRCT)
domains. It shares only 57% identity with its mouse ortholog, with the
most conserved regions being the BRCT domains, where there is 80%
identity.

Using RT-PCR of fetal tissues, Jackson et al. (2002) confirmed that
microcephalin is expressed in fetal brain. A similar level of expression
was present in fetal liver and kidney, and transcripts were detectable
at low levels in a range of other fetal tissues, as well as in a number
of adult tissues. In situ hybridization experiments on fetal mouse
sections showed that microcephalin is expressed during neurogenesis. In
fetal brain, high levels of gene expression localized to the developing
forebrain and, in particular, to the walls of the lateral ventricles.
Progenitor cells in this region divide to produce neurons that migrate
to form the cerebral cortex.

Using Western blot analysis, Xu et al. (2004) detected a 100-kD MCPH1
protein in human cell lines.

GENE FUNCTION

Lin et al. (2005) examined the role of BRIT1 in DNA damage response and
found that it was required for intra-S and G2/M checkpoints after
irradiation damage in a human osteosarcoma cell line. These BRIT1
activities appeared to result from regulation or activation of at least
3 other checkpoint regulators, CHK1 (CHEK1; 603078), BRCA1, and NBS1
(602667).

Using immunofluorescence, Xu et al. (2004) showed MCPH1 colocalized in
ionizing irradiation (IR)-induced foci with NFBD1 (MDC1; 607593) and
other DNA damage checkpoint proteins in human embryonic kidney cells
following IR exposure. Inhibition of MCPH1 expression by small
interfering RNA led to defective IR-induced intra-S-phase and G2/M
checkpoints and was associated with decreased BRCA1 and CHK1 mRNA and
protein.

Alderton et al. (2006) found defective G2/M checkpoint arrest, nuclear
fragmentation after DNA damage, and supernumerary mitotic centrosomes in
human lymphoblastoid cell lines with different truncating mutations in
MCPH1. Mutant cells failed to inhibit CDC45 (603465) loading onto
chromatin after replication arrest. They also showed low levels of
tyr15-phosphorylated CDK1 (CDC2; 116940) in S and G2 phase, which
correlated with elevated frequency of G2-like cells displaying premature
chromosome condensation. Alderton et al. (2006) concluded that MCPH1 has
a role in maintaining inhibitory CDK1 phosphorylation, which prevents
premature entry into mitosis.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Jackson et al. (2002) determined that the
MCPH1 gene contains 14 exons.

MAPPING

By positional cloning, Jackson et al. (2002) mapped the MCPH1 gene to
the primary microcephaly-1 critical region on chromosome 8p23. Jackson
et al. (2002) mapped the mouse Mcph1 gene to chromosome 8A2, a region
that also contains the Angpt2 gene and thus shows homology of synteny to
human chromosome 8p23.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Jackson et al. (2002) identified a homozygous mutation in the
microcephalin gene (S25X; 607117.0001) in 2 families with primary
microcephaly-1 (MCPH1; 251200) sharing an ancestral 8p23 haplotype. All
7 affected individuals were homozygous for the mutation, and their 8
parents (obligate carriers) were heterozygous for this mutation. The
S25X mutation occurred in the first BRCT domain and considerably
truncated the microcephalin protein.

In 2 sibs, born of consanguineous parents, with microcephaly and
premature chromosome condensation syndrome originally reported by
Neitzel et al. (2002), Trimborn et al. (2004) identified a homozygous
1-bp insertion (427insA; 607117.0002) in exon 5 of the MCPH1 gene. The
cellular phenotype showed premature chromosome condensation in the early
G2 phase of the cell cycle, which may be a useful diagnostic marker for
individuals with mutation in the MCPH1 gene. Trimborn et al. (2004)
demonstrated that siRNA-mediated depletion of MCPH1 is sufficient to
reproduce this cellular phenotype, and also showed that MCPH1-deficient
cells exhibit delayed decondensation postmitosis. These findings
implicated microcephalin as a regulator of chromosome condensation and
linked the apparently disparate fields of neurogenesis and chromosome
biology.

Darvish et al. (2010) identified 8 different homozygous mutations in the
MCPH1 gene (see, e.g., 607117.0004-607117.0006) in 8 (8.7%) of 112
Iranian families with primary microcephaly, mental retardation, and
premature chromosome condensation. Six of the mutations were predicted
to result in a truncated protein. One of the families and the
corresponding mutation had been reported by Garshasbi et al. (2006).

EVOLUTION

Human evolution is characterized by a dramatic increase in brain size
and complexity. To probe its genetic basis, Dorus et al. (2004) examined
the evolution of genes involved in diverse aspects of nervous system
biology. These genes, including MCPH1, displayed significantly higher
rates of protein evolution in primates than in rodents. This trend was
most pronounced for the subset of genes implicated in nervous system
development. Moreover, within primates, the acceleration of protein
evolution was most prominent in the lineage leading from ancestral
primates to humans. Dorus et al. (2004) concluded that the phenotypic
evolution of the human nervous system has a salient molecular correlate,
i.e., accelerated evolution of the underlying genes, particularly those
linked to nervous system development.

Similarly, Evans et al. (2004) showed that the evolution of
microcephalin's protein sequence was highly accelerated throughout the
lineage from simian ancestors to humans and chimpanzees, with the most
pronounced acceleration seen in the early periods of this lineage. This
accelerated evolution was coupled with signatures of positive selection.
Statistical analysis suggested that about 45 advantageous amino acid
changes in microcephalin might have fixed during the 25 to 30 million
years of evolution from early simian progenitors to modern humans. These
observations supported the notion that the molecular evolution of
microcephalin may have contributed to brain expansion in the simian
lineage leading to humans.

Wang and Su (2004) sequenced the coding region of microcephalin gene in
humans and 12 representative nonhuman primate species covering great
apes, lesser apes, Old World monkeys, and New World monkeys.
Microcephalin was highly polymorphic in human populations. Among 22
substitutions in the coding region of microcephalin gene in human
populations, 15 caused amino acid changes. Neutrality tests and
phylogenetic analysis indicated that the sequence variations of
microcephalin in humans were likely caused by the combination of recent
population expansion and Darwinian positive selection.
Synonymous/nonsynonymous analyses in primates revealed positive
selection on microcephalin during the origin of the last common ancestor
of humans and great apes, which coincides with the drastic brain
enlargement from lesser apes to great apes. A codon-based neutrality
test also indicated the signal of positive selection on 5 individual
amino acid sites of microcephalin, which may contribute to brain
enlargement during primate evolution and human origin.

Evans et al. (2005) presented evidence that haplotype 49 of
microcephalin, corresponding to the C allele of the G37995C SNP,
increased its frequency too rapidly to be compatible with neutral drift.
This indicates that it has spread under strong positive selection. The
G37995C SNP occurs in exon 8 and changes amino acid 314 from an
ancestral aspartate to a histidine (D314H). Position 37995 of the
genomic sequence corresponds to position 940 of the open reading frame.

Currat et al. (2006) commented on the paper by Evans et al. (2005),
stating that they had developed models of human history including both
population growth and spatial structure that could generate the observed
pattern of microcephalin haplotypes without selection. Mekel-Bobrov et
al. (2006) responded that the demographic models adopted by Currat et
al. (2006) strongly contradicted a decade of empirical research on human
demographic history and did not account for the critical features of the
data on which Mekel-Bobrov et al. (2006) had developed their argument
for selection.

In a study of 5 independent population-based samples comprising 2,393
individuals, Mekel-Bobrov et al. (2007) did not find a detectable
association between the recent adaptive evolution of either the ASPM
(605481) or microcephalin genes and normal variation in IQ.

Maghirang-Rodriguez et al. (2009) found no association between the 940G
variant of MCPH1 and microcephaly or mental retardation among 1,054
affected individuals compared to 401 controls. However, in controls the
frequency of the 940G allele was significantly higher among African
Americans (66%) compared to Caucasians (17%).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MICROCEPHALY 1, PRIMARY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
MCPH1, SER25TER

Jackson et al. (2002) identified a C-to-G transversion at nucleotide 74
in exon 2 of the microcephalin gene, resulting in a ser25-to-ter (S25X)
substitution, in 2 families with primary microcephaly (251200) sharing
an ancestral 8p23 haplotype. All 7 affected individuals were homozygous
for the mutation, and their 8 parents (obligate carriers) were
heterozygous for this mutation. The S25X mutation occurred in the first
BRCT domain of microcephalin and considerably truncated the protein.

Alderton et al. (2006) found that cells expressing the S25X mutation had
reduced, but residual, MCPH1 protein expression. The mutant protein
would result in loss of the N-terminal BRCT domain.

.0002
MICROCEPHALY 1, PRIMARY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
MCPH1, 1-BP INS, 427A

In 2 sibs, born to consanguineous parents, with microcephaly (251200)
and premature chromosome condensation originally reported by Neitzel et
al. (2002), Trimborn et al. (2004) sequenced the entire coding region of
the MCPH1 gene; they identified a homozygous 1-bp insertion in exon 5,
427insA, resulting in a frameshift with a premature stop codon in exon 6
and, thus, a markedly truncated protein of 146 amino acids encoding only
the N-terminal BRCT domain of the protein. The insertion, which occurred
within a run of 6 adenines, was heterozygous in both unaffected parents
and not present in 220 control alleles. Trimborn et al. (2004) concluded
that the cellular phenotype was due to functional loss of the
microcephalin protein.

Alderton et al. (2006) found that cells expressing the 427insA mutant
lacked detectable MCPH1 protein. The mutant transcript underwent
nonsense-mediated decay, but residual mutant mRNA was detectable.

.0003
MICROCEPHALY 1, PRIMARY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
MCPH1, 150-KB DEL

In 6 affected members of a consanguineous Iranian family with mental
retardation, mild microcephaly (-3 SD), and premature chromosome
condensation in at least 10 to 15% of cells (251200), Garshasbi et al.
(2006) identified a homozygous 150- to 200-kb deletion encompassing the
promoter and the first 6 exons of the MCPH1 gene.

.0004
MICROCEPHALY 1, PRIMARY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
MCPH1, 1-BP INS, 566A

In 3 affected members of a consanguineous Iranian family with
microcephaly (-6 SD), moderate mental retardation, and premature
chromosome condensation (251200), Darvish et al. (2010) identified a
homozygous 1-bp insertion (566insA) in exon 6 of the MCPH1 gene,
predicted to result in a frameshift. The mutation was not found in 160
German and 190 Iranian controls.

.0005
MICROCEPHALY 1, PRIMARY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
MCPH1, HIS49GLN

In 4 affected members of a consanguineous Iranian family with
microcephaly (-7 to -9 SD), moderate mental retardation, and premature
chromosome condensation (251200), Darvish et al. (2010) identified a
homozygous 147C-G transversion in exon 3 of the MCPH1 gene, predicted to
result in his49-to-gln (H49Q) substitution in the BRCT1 domain. The
mutation was not found in 160 German and 190 Iranian controls.

.0006
MICROCEPHALY 1, PRIMARY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
MCPH1, SER72LEU

In 3 affected members of a consanguineous Iranian family with
microcephaly (-6 to -7 SD), mild to moderate mental retardation, and
premature chromosome condensation (251200), Darvish et al. (2010)
identified a homozygous 215C-T transition in exon 3 of the MCPH1 gene,
predicted to result in ser72-to-leu (S72L) substitution in the BRCT1
domain. The mutation was not found in 160 German and 190 Iranian
controls.

.0007
MICROCEPHALY 1, PRIMARY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
MCPH1, SER101TER

In a Danish female with primary microcephaly-1 (251200), previously
reported by Tommerup et al. (1993), Farooq et al. (2010) identified a
homozygous 302C-G transversion in exon 4 of the MCPH1 gene, resulting in
a ser101-to-ter (S101X) substitution. The truncated protein was
predicted to retain the N-terminal BRCT domain but lack the 2 C-terminal
BRCT domains. The patient also had craniosynostosis, ptosis, and
bird-like facies with micrognathia. The cellular phenotype of
chromosomal sensitivity to DNA damage was particularly severe, which the
authors suggested may be related to presence of the N-terminal BRCT
domain.

610211	TITLE *610211 SRA STEM LOOP-INTERACTING RNA-BINDING PROTEIN; SLIRP
;;CHROMOSOME 14 OPEN READING FRAME 156; C14ORF156
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Steroid receptor RNA activator (SRA, or SRA1; 603819) is a complex RNA
molecule containing multiple stable stem-loop structures that functions
in coactivation of nuclear receptors. SLIRP interacts with stem-loop
structure-7 of SRA (STR7) and modulates nuclear receptor transactivation
(Hatchell et al., 2006).

CLONING

Using STR7 as bait in a yeast 3-hybrid screen of a primary breast cancer
cDNA library, Hatchell et al. (2006) cloned SLIRP. The deduced 109-amino
acid protein contains a putative N-terminal mitochondrial localization
sequence and a central RNA recognition domain with RNP1 and RNP2
submotifs. It has putative sites for N-myristoylation and
phosphorylation. Northern blot analysis detected variable expression of
SLIRP in all tissues examined, with highest levels in heart, liver,
skeletal muscle, and testis. Western blot analysis detected SLIRP at an
apparent molecular mass of 12.7 kD in several human cell lines.
Immunohistochemical analysis of primary breast cancer tissue showed high
SLIRP expression in a punctate cytoplasmic distribution. Expression was
lower in normal ductal tissue, and no expression was detected in the
surrounding stroma. SLIRP colocalized with a mitochondrial marker
protein.

GENE FUNCTION

By immunoprecipitation RT-PCR, Hatchell et al. (2006) found that SRA
copurified with SLIRP in several human cell lines. SLIRP repressed
transactivation by nuclear receptors in an SRA-dependent manner, and
SLIRP function required an intact RRM domain. SLIRP was recruited to
endogenous promoters, augmented the estrogen antagonistic effects of
tamoxifen, modulated association of SRC1 (NCOA1; 602691) with SRA, and
reduced SKIP (SKIIP; 603055)-potentiated nuclear receptor signaling.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Hatchell et al. (2006) mapped the SLIRP
gene to chromosome 14q24.3.

603170	TITLE *603170 TEA DOMAIN FAMILY MEMBER 3; TEAD3
;;TRANSCRIPTIONAL ENHANCER FACTOR 5; TEF5;;
TEA DOMAIN FAMILY MEMBER 5, FORMERLY; TEAD5, FORMERLY
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Transcriptional enhancer factors (TEFs), a family of transcription
factors, contain the TEA/ATTS DNA-binding domain. See TEF1 (TEAD1;
189967).

CLONING

Jacquemin et al. (1997) noted that putative TEF-binding sites had been
identified in the placenta-specific human chorionic somatomammotropin B
gene (CSH2; 118820) enhancer. To isolate TEFs expressed in placenta,
Jacquemin et al. (1997) used degenerate oligonucleotides corresponding
to conserved regions of the TEA/ATTS domain for PCR amplification of a
human placental cDNA library. They used the resulting PCR fragment to
clone a full-length TEF5 cDNA. The predicted 435-amino acid protein
shares 79%, 83%, and 84% sequence similarity with TEF4 (TEAD2; 601729),
TEF3 (TEAD4; 601714), and TEF1, respectively. Northern blot analysis
showed that TEF5 is expressed as a 3.2-kb mRNA in human placenta and
skeletal muscle, and more weakly in heart; an additional 8.1-kb mRNA was
present in placenta and a 1.7-kb transcript in skeletal muscle.

GENE FUNCTION

Jacquemin et al. (1997) demonstrated that TEF5 binds to multiple
functional sites in the CSH2 enhancer. Mutations in these sites that
disrupted TEF5 binding also inactivated the transcription-enhancing
activity of the element. The authors showed that the placental protein
f/chorionic somatomammotropin enhancer factor-1 (PPf/CSEF1), which binds
to TEF-binding sites in the CSH2 enhancer, is a proteolytic degradation
product of TEFs. They suggested that TEF5 regulates the activity of the
CSH2 gene enhancer and is an important regulatory factor in the human
placenta.

Jiang et al. (1999) noted that human chorionic somatomammotropin (see
150200) gene expression in the placenta is controlled by an enhancer
(designated CSEn) containing SV40-related GT-IIC and SphI/SphII
enhansons (see 189967). TEF5, whose mRNA is abundant in placenta, was
shown to bind cooperatively to a unique, tandemly repeated element in
CSEn2, suggesting that TEF5 regulates CSEn activity. The open reading
frame of one 3,033-bp clone was identical to TEF5 and contained 300- and
1423-bp 5-prime and 3-prime-untranslated regions, respectively. The in
vitro generated approximately 53-kD TEF5 polypeptide binds specifically
to GT-IIC and SphI/SphII oligonucleotides. Overexpression of TEF5 in
BeWo cells using the intact 3,033-bp cDNA transactivates the chorionic
somatomammotropin and SV40 enhancers and artificial enhancers comprised
of tandemly repeated GT-IIc enhansons, but not control octomeric
enhansons. The authors concluded that TEF5 is a transactivator that is
likely involved in the transactivation of CSEn function.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization and radiation hybrid analysis,
Jacquemin et al. (1999) mapped the TEAD3 gene to 6p21.2. By
interspecific backcross analysis, Jacquemin et al. (1999) mapped the
mouse Tead3 gene to the proximal region of chromosome 17.

603522	TITLE *603522 SMALL NUCLEAR RIBONUCLEOPROTEIN POLYPEPTIDE C; SNRPC
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The C polypeptide is one of the specific protein constituents of the U1
snRNP (small nuclear ribonucleoprotein) particle. See SNRPA (182285).
Patients with connective tissue diseases often produce autoantibodies
against snRNP particles. By screening human expression libraries with
anti-RNP sera, both Yamamoto et al. (1988) and Sillekens et al. (1988)
isolated cDNAs encoding SNRPC. Using Northern blot hybridization,
Yamamoto et al. (1988) determined that SNRPC is expressed as an
approximately 0.8-kb mRNA. Antibodies against SNRPC stained the nuclei
of HeLa cells in a speckled pattern. Sillekens et al. (1988) reported
that the predicted 159-amino acid SNRPC protein has an apparent
molecular mass of 22 kD by SDS-PAGE. They noted that the DNA sequence
reported by Yamamoto et al. (1988) contained several single-base
deletions that altered the reading frame. Sillekens et al. (1988)
considered these changes to be the result of sequencing errors, based on
the fact that the Xenopus snRNP C protein also contains 159 amino acids
and differs in only a few positions from SNRPC. Southern blot analysis
suggested that there are multiple copies of the SNRPC gene in the
mammalian genome. Nelissen et al. (1997) found that the mouse genome
contains an snRNP C gene, called U1C by them, and 2 U1C processed
pseudogenes. The predicted mouse and human SNRPC proteins are identical
except for a single residue.

MAPPING

By analysis of radiation hybrids, the SNRPC gene has been mapped to
chromosome 6 (TMAP sts-X12517).

GENE FUNCTION

Du and Rosbash (2002) demonstrated that U1 snRNP lacking the 5-prime end
of its snRNA retains 5-prime splice site sequence specificity. They also
showed that recombinant yeast U1C protein, a U1 snRNP protein, selects a
5-prime splice site-like sequence in which the first 4 nucleotides,
GUAU, are identical to the first 4 nucleotides of the yeast 5-prime
splice site consensus sequence. Du and Rosbash (2002) proposed that a
U1C 5-prime splice site interaction precedes pre-mRNA/U1 snRNA base
pairing and is the earliest step in the splicing pathway.

609752	TITLE *609752 NUCLEAR RECEPTOR COACTIVATOR 7; NCOA7
;;ERAP140
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By Far Western screening of a lymphoma cell cDNA library for estrogen
receptor-alpha (ESR1; 133430)-associated factors, Shao et al. (2002)
identified a novel cDNA, nuclear receptor coactivator-7. NCOA7 encodes a
942-amino acid protein, which the authors called ERAP140 (estrogen
receptor-associated protein of 140 kD). Northern blot analysis revealed
an approximately 5.5-kb transcript in all tumor lines examined,
including ESR-positive and ESR-negative breast cancer cell lines and
HeLa cells. Northern blot analysis of multiple human tissues revealed
highest expression in brain, with lower expression in mammary gland,
ovary, uterus, prostate, stomach, bladder, spinal cord, and pancreas. In
situ hybridization in mouse tissues demonstrated exclusive expression in
neurons in brain and significant expression in the cortex but not in the
medulla in kidney.

GENE FUNCTION

Using GST pull-down assays, Shao et al. (2002) found that NCOA7
demonstrated a low level of ligand-dependent constitutive binding to
ESR1, ESR2 (see 601663), THRB (190160), PPARG (601487), and RARA
(180240). Binding was further induced by the presence of ligands. NCOA7
did not bind to RXRA (180245) in the presence or absence of ligand.
NCOA7 can enhance the transcriptional activity of the nuclear receptors
with which it interacts.

Shao et al. (2002) found that NCOA7 differs from other nuclear receptor
coactivators in that it does not contain an LXXLL receptor-coactivator
interaction motif. Instead it contains a central domain between amino
acids 489 and 559 that mediates ESR1 binding. A leucine at position 523
and/or an isoleucine at position 524 appeared to be essential for the
interaction, and the binding surface appeared to be similar to that of
other coactivators.

GENE STRUCTURE

Shao et al. (2002) demonstrated that the NCOA7 gene contains 15 exons
and spans about 150 kb of genomic DNA.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Shao et al. (2002) mapped the NCOA7 gene to
chromosome 6q22.33.

;;CORONIN 1;;
CORONIN-LIKE PROTEIN A; CLIPINA;;
TRYPTOPHANE ASPARTATE-CONTAINING COAT PROTEIN; TACO
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The CORO1A gene encodes an actin-regulating protein that is expressed
mainly in hematopoietic cells (summary by Shiow et al., 2008).

CLONING

By micropeptide sequence analysis of a 57-kD protein that copurified
with a phospholipase C protein (see PLCD1; 602142), followed by probing
a T cell line, Suzuki et al. (1995) obtained a cDNA encoding CORO1A,
which they called p57. The deduced 461-amino acid CORO1A protein shares
40% amino acid identity with coronin, an actin-binding protein of
Dictyostelium discoideum. Sequence analysis predicted that CORO1A
contains a WD (trp/asp) repeat and a leucine zipper motif. Immunoblot
analysis revealed cross-reactivity of human, calf, and mouse CORO1A, and
Coro1a was clearly expressed in mouse brain, thymus, spleen, bone
marrow, and lymph node, with weak expression in lung and gut, and no
expression in liver, kidney, stomach, and skeletal muscle. Using a
cosedimentation assay, Suzuki et al. (1995) determined that CORO1A is an
actin-binding protein.

GENE FUNCTION

Mycobacteria are pathogens that successfully exploit cellular mechanisms
to survive within macrophage phagosomes. Instead of being destroyed in
this normally hostile environment, mycobacteria, which include the
causative organisms of tuberculosis and leprosy, evade host defenses and
use host cellular components to thrive within macrophages. Phagosomes
containing living but not dead mycobacteria resist fusion to endosomal
and lysosomal organelles, presumably allowing mycobacteria to escape
macrophage bactericidal mechanisms. The mycobacterial phagosome lacks
late-stage but not early-stage markers of the endocytic pathway. For
example, the mycobacterial phagosome selectively excludes the
proton-ATPase (see ATP6F; 603717) responsible for acidification along
the pathway. To identify factors that contribute to the intraphagosomal
survival of mycobacteria, Ferrari et al. (1999) used organelle
electrophoresis to separate early phagosomes from late phagosomes
(containing living and dead mycobacteria, respectively),
isoelectric-focusing (IEF)/SDS-PAGE analysis, and micropeptide sequence
analysis. They identified a mouse protein matching the digestion profile
of human CORO1A peptides, and by screening a mouse macrophage cDNA
library with a human CORO1A cDNA, they obtained a cDNA encoding the
461-amino acid mouse Coro1a protein, which they called Taco (tryptophane
aspartate-containing coat protein). Sequence analysis predicted that the
Coro1a protein contains a coiled-coil region within the 32 C-terminal
amino acids, 5 WD repeats, and no signal sequence. Immunoblot analysis
detected Coro1a expression in spleen, lymph nodes, thymus, and brain,
with weak expression in lung and no expression in heart, kidney, and
muscle. Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy of uninfected macrophages
demonstrated that Coro1a localizes with tubulin (see TUBB; 191130) but
not actin in the cell cortex. Immediately after infection, Coro1a
localized around mycobacterial phagosomes as well as cortex before
localizing predominantly to the phagosomal membrane for prolonged
periods of time. The phagosomal localization was only transient in
macrophages exposed to heat-killed mycobacteria. Tubulin, on the other
hand, localized transiently to live mycobacterial phagosomes and
persistently only to dead mycobacterial phagosomes. Immunoblot analysis
showed that Coro1a is absent in liver macrophages (Kupffer cells), which
also rapidly destroy mycobacteria. Based on the interaction between
Coro1a and tubulin, Ferrari et al. (1999) speculated that the WD repeats
in CORO1A may act as microtubule-binding domains. Given the apparent
involvement of tubulin in phagosome-lysosome fusion, they suggested that
mycobacteria retain CORO1A on the phagosomal membrane to prevent the
recruitment of lysosomes.

Tanigawa et al. (2009) found that CORO1A suppressed Toll-like receptor
(TLR) signaling following expression in a human monocytic cell line.
TLR2 (603028)-mediated activation of the innate immune response resulted
in suppression of CORO1A expression. However, in cells infected with
Mycobacterium leprae, the causative agent of leprosy (see 609888),
TLR2-mediated CORO1A suppression was inhibited, as was NFKB (see 164011)
activation. Tanigawa et al. (2009) proposed that the balance between
TLR2-mediated signaling and CORO1A expression is key in determining the
fate of M. leprae after infection.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a girl with immunodeficiency-8 (IMD8; 615401), Shiow et al. (2009)
identified compound heterozygosity for a truncating mutation in the
CORO1A gene (605000.0001) and a de novo heterozygous 600-kb deletion of
chromosome 16p11.2 (611913) encompassing 24 genes, including CORO1A.
Thus, she had a homozygous absence of the CORO1A gene, with absent
expression of the protein in her lymphocytes. She presented with
early-onset recurrent infections and post-vaccination varicella at age
13 months. Immunologic workup showed decreased numbers of lymphocytes,
poor T-cell function with decreased proliferative response and lack of
helper T-cell function for antibody isotype switching, and low
immunoglobulins. B and NK cells were present, and her thymus was
present. Shiow et al. (2008) demonstrated that Coro1a is mutated in a
mouse model with peripheral T-cell deficiency (Ptcd), providing further
evidence for pathogenicity.

Moshous et al. (2013) reported 3 sibs, born of consanguineous Moroccan
parents, with infantile-onset recurrent infections and an aggressive
Epstein-Barr virus (EVS)-induced B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder
associated with a homozygous missense mutation in the CORO1A gene
(V134M; 605000.0002). The mutation, which was found using homozygosity
mapping and exome sequencing, segregated with the disorder in the family
and was not found in the dbSNP or the Exome Variant Server database.
Patient lymphocytes showed normal levels of mutant mRNA, but
significantly decreased amounts of the mutant protein, suggesting that
the mutation causes decreased CORO1A stability. Two of the sibs died in
infancy, whereas the remaining sib was successfully treated and in
remission at age 11.5 years, but had some cognitive and behavioral
abnormalities, including attention deficit and hyperactivity. Overall,
the findings were consistent with an immunodeficiency characterized by a
defect in naive T cells and a defect in expansion of oligoclonal T cells
associated with increased susceptibility to EBV infection. Impaired
survival of mature T cells in turn likely affected lymphocyte
homeostasis, repertoire selection, and lineage commitment. Moshous et
al. (2013) noted that the immunodeficiency phenotype in their patients
was less severe than that reported by Shiow et al. (2009), suggesting
that the missense mutant protein may have retained some residual
function.

ANIMAL MODEL

Foger et al. (2006) generated coronin-1-null mice and found that
coronin-1 exerted an inhibitory effect on cellular steady-state F-actin
formation via an Arp2/3 (604221)-dependent mechanism. Whereas coronin-1
was required for chemokine-mediated migration, it was dispensable for
T-cell antigen receptor functions in T cells. Moreover, Foger et al.
(2006) found that actin dynamics, through a mitochondrial pathway, was
linked to lymphocyte homeostasis.

Haraldsson et al. (2008) identified a gln262-to-ter mutation in the
Coro1a gene within the lupus (SLE; 152700)-related Lmb3 quantitative
trait locus on mouse chromosome 7. The mutation resulted in T cells with
diminished capacity to migrate, survive, be activated, and undergo
Ca(2+) flux. Transfer of mutant Coro1a T cells suppressed development of
autoimmunity in recipient mice. Haraldsson et al. (2008) concluded that
CORO1A is required for development of SLE.

Shiow et al. (2008) determined that the 'peripheral T-cell deficiency'
(Ptcd) trait in mice, which is characterized by defective egress of
mature thymocytes from the thymus, is due to an E26K point mutation in
the Coro1a gene. Ptcd T cells had an intrinsic migration defect,
impaired lymphoid tissue trafficking, and irregularly shaped
protrusions, suggestive of an abnormal actin cytoskeleton. In addition,
mutant Coro1a was mislocalized from the leading edge of migrating T
cells. Biochemical studies showed that the pathogenic E26K mutant
protein enhanced Coro1a inhibition of the actin regulator Arp2/3,
consistent with a gain of function. A parallel ENU-mutagenesis screen
identified another mutant mouse model, 'Koyaanisqatsi' (Koy), with
circulating T-cell lymphopenia due to a hypomorphic mutation in the
Coro1a gene. The findings implicated a role for Coro1a in T-cell egress
from the thymus and lymph nodes, which plays a larger role in immunity.

IMMUNODEFICIENCY 8
CORO1A, 2-BP DEL, 248CT

In a girl with immunodeficiency-8 (IMD8; 615401), Shiow et al. (2009)
identified a heterozygous 2-bp deletion in exon 3 of the CORO1A gene
(248delCT), resulting in a frameshift and premature termination
(Pro83ArgfsTer10), which was inherited from her unaffected father. In
addition, she had attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder and mild
cognitive impairment associated with a de novo heterozygous 600-kb
deletion of chromosome 16p11.2 (611913) encompassing 24 genes, including
CORO1A. Thus, she had a homozygous absence of the CORO1A gene, with no
expression of the protein in her lymphocytes. She presented with
early-onset recurrent infections and postvaccination varicella at age 13
months. Immunologic workup showed decreased numbers of lymphocytes, poor
T-cell function with decreased proliferative response and lack of helper
T-cell function for antibody isotype switching, and low immunoglobulins.
B and NK cells were present. Her thymus was present. Hematopoietic stem
cell transplantation was successful. Shiow et al. (2008) demonstrated
that Coro1a is mutated in a mouse model with peripheral T-cell
deficiency (Ptcd), providing further evidence for pathogenicity.

IMMUNODEFICIENCY 8
CORO1A, VAL134MET

In 3 sibs, born of consanguineous parents of Moroccan ancestry, with
immunodeficiency-8 (615401), Moshous et al. (2013) identified a
homozygous c.717G-A transition in exon 4 of the CORO1A gene, resulting
in a val134-to-met (V134M) substitution at a highly conserved residue in
the beta-propeller domain. The mutation, which was found by homozygosity
mapping and exome sequencing, segregated with the disorder in the family
and was not found in the dbSNP or the Exome Variant Server database.
Patient lymphocytes showed normal levels of mutant mRNA, but
significantly decreased amounts of the mutant protein, suggesting that
the mutation causes decreased CORO1A stability. Cells from the
heterozygous mother showed a moderate decrease in mutant protein
expression. Patient T-cell blasts showed delayed activation of signaling
molecules ERK1 (601795) and ERK2 (176948), but further functional
studies could not be performed because of lack of material. The patients
presented in infancy with recurrent infections and Epstein-Barr virus
(EBV)-induced B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder, resulting in early
death in 2 sibs. The remaining sib was successfully treated and was in
remission at age 11.5 years, but had some cognitive and behavioral
abnormalities, including attention deficit and hyperactivity.

164160	TITLE *164160 LEPTIN; LEP
;;OBESE, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF; OB
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Leptin is a 16-kD protein that plays a critical role in the regulation
of body weight by inhibiting food intake and stimulating energy
expenditure. Defects in leptin production cause severe hereditary
obesity in rodents and humans. In addition to its effects on body
weight, leptin has a variety of other functions, including the
regulation of hematopoiesis, angiogenesis, wound healing, and the immune
and inflammatory response. Leptin acts through the leptin receptor
(LEPR; 601007), a single-transmembrane-domain receptor of the cytokine
receptor family, which is found in many tissues in several alternatively
spliced forms. The LEP gene is the human homolog of the gene (ob) mutant
in the mouse 'obese' phenotype.

CLONING

Zhang et al. (1994) isolated the ob gene of the mouse by positional
cloning. They likewise cloned and sequenced its human homolog. The gene
encodes a 4.5-kb adipose tissue mRNA with a highly conserved 167-amino
acid open reading frame. The predicted amino acid sequence is 84%
identical between human and mouse and has features of a secreted
protein.

Masuzaki et al. (1995) found that the nucleotide sequence of the human
OB cDNA coding region is 83% identical to those of the mouse and rat ob
cDNA coding regions. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences
revealed that the human OB protein is a 166-amino acid polypeptide with
a putative signal sequence and is 84% and 83% homologous to the mouse
and rat ob proteins, respectively. Northern blot analysis using the
cloned human OB cDNA fragment as a probe identified a single 4.5-kb mRNA
species found in abundance in adipose tissues obtained from multiple
sites.

Gong et al. (1996) cloned a 3-kb 5-prime flanking region of the OB gene;
transient transfection assays with a luciferase reporter gene confirmed
its promoter activity in differentiated adipocytes. They determined that
the human OB gene encodes a 3.5-kb cDNA.

MAPPING

In the mouse, the Met oncogene (164860) is closely linked to the ob
gene. The human MET gene is on chromosome 7. Friedman et al. (1991)
found that the ob locus maps to chromosome 6 of the mouse in the
following order: cen--Cola2--Met--ob--Cpa--Tcrb. Since the homologs of
the markers that flank ob in the mouse map to human chromosome 7q,
Friedman et al. (1991) suggested that the human ob homolog maps to 7q31.
Their data suggested, furthermore, that the development of diabetes in
the ob animal is a consequence of unlinked polygenes. They also had
evidence that unlinked Mus spretus alleles can diminish the obesity of
ob/ob mice.

Green et al. (1995) mapped the human OB gene on a YAC contig from 7q31.3
that contained sequence tagged sites corresponding to
microsatellite-type genetic markers. Because of their close physical
proximity to the human OB gene, these genetic markers represented
valuable tools for analyzing families with evidence of hereditary
obesity and for investigating the possible association between OB
mutations and human obesity. Geffroy et al. (1995) mapped the human OB
gene to 7q32 by fluorescence in situ hybridization. By fluorescence in
situ hybridization, Isse et al. (1995) mapped the OB gene to 7q31.3.

- Linkage to Obesity-Related Traits

See obesity (601665) for a discussion of linkage studies on obesity in
various human populations.

Using sibship data obtained from 32 low-income Mexican American
pedigrees ascertained on the basis of a type II (NIDDM) diabetic proband
and applying a multipoint variance-components method, Duggirala et al.
(1996) tested for linkage between various obesity-related traits plus
associated metabolic traits in 15 markers on human chromosome 7. They
found evidence for linkage between markers in the OB gene region and
various traits: extremity skin folds (lod = 3.1), 32,33-split proinsulin
level (lod = 4.2), and HCPA1 and proinsulin level (lod = 3.2). A
putative susceptibility locus linked to the marker D7S514 explained 56%
of the total phenotypic variation in extremity skin folds. Variation at
the carboxypeptidase A1 locus (114850) explained 64% phenotypic
variation in proinsulin level and approximately 73% of phenotypic
variation in split proinsulin concentration. Weaker evidence for linkage
to several other obesity-related traits (e.g., waist circumference,
body-mass index, fat mass by bioimpedance, etc.) was observed for a
genetic location approximately 15 cM telomeric to OB.

The human homolog of the murine ob locus is on chromosome 7q31.3.
Clement et al. (1996) used 8 microsatellite markers spanning this region
to genotype 101 obese French families. Affected sib-pair analyses for
extreme obesity, defined by BMI greater than 35 kg per sq m, suggested
evidence for linkage to 3 markers located within 2 cM of the human OB
gene. Similarly, Reed et al. (1996) genotyped sibs from 78 families
using markers flanking the OB gene. Fifty-nine pairs of sibs with
extreme obesity (BMI 40 or greater) shared haplotypes identical by
descent for the region containing the OB gene at greater than chance
levels (corrected p = 0.04). Furthermore, 1 haplotype containing the OB
gene was transmitted by heterozygous parents to extremely obese
offspring more frequently than expected by chance, indicating
significant allelic disequilibrium (corrected p = 0.027). One
explanation for these linkage findings is that some individuals with
extreme obesity have an allelic variant of the OB gene.

See Comuzzie et al. (1997) for data regarding a major quantitative trait
locus (QTL) on 2p21 affecting leptin serum levels (601694).

GENE STRUCTURE

Isse et al. (1995) found by Southern blot analysis a single copy of the
OB gene in the human genome. The gene spans approximately 20 kb and
contains 3 exons separated by 2 introns. The first intron, approximately
10.6 kb, is in the 5-prime untranslated region, 29 bp upstream of the
ATG start codon. The second intron of 2.3 kb is located at glutamine
+49. By rapid amplification of 5-prime cDNA ends (RACE), the
transcription initiation sites were mapped 54 to 57 bp upstream of the
ATG start codon.

He et al. (1995) determined the genomic organization of the 5-prime end
of the mouse ob gene. The coding sequences are in exons 2 and 3. A
single TATA-containing promoter was found upstream of exon 1.
Transcription of the ob gene was detected only in adipose cells. The
promoter contained consensus Sp1 (189906) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding
protein (C/EBP; 116897) motifs.

Miller et al. (1996) described the structure of the human OB gene and an
initial analysis of its promoter. The gene's 3 exons cover approximately
15 kb of genomic DNA. The entire coding region is contained in exons 2
and 3, which are separated by a 2-kb intron. The first small 30-bp
untranslated exon is located more than 10.5 kb upstream of the initiator
ATG codon.

Gong et al. (1996) demonstrated that the human OB gene consists of 3
exons and 2 introns and spans about 18 kb.

GENE FUNCTION

He et al. (1995) found that cotransfection of the mouse 'obese' gene
promoter with C/EBP-alpha, a transcription factor important in adipose
cell differentiation, caused 23-fold activation. He et al. (1995)
suggested that the 'obese' promoter is a natural target of C/EBP-alpha.

Miller et al. (1996) determined that only 217 bp of 5-prime sequence are
required for basal adipose tissue-specific expression of the human OB
gene, as well as enhanced expression by C/EBP-alpha. Mutation of the
single C/EBP-alpha site in this region abolished inducibility of the
promoter by C/EBP-alpha in cotransfection assays. Miller et al. (1996)
noted that knowledge of sequence elements and factors regulating OB gene
expression should be of major importance in the prevention and treatment
of obesity.

To investigate the effect of leptin on fetal growth, Matsuda et al.
(1997) measured serum leptin concentrations in venous cord bloods of 82
newborns. Serum leptin concentrations in males were significantly lower
than those in females and those in cord blood correlated positively with
birth weight and body weight/body height. The serum concentrations of
estradiol and testosterone did not differ between males and females and
did not correlate with the leptin concentration. They concluded that
gender differences in fetal leptin levels are not due either to body fat
content or distribution or to reproductive hormone status, but rather to
genetic differences between males and females. Harigaya et al. (1997)
found that leptin levels in serum drawn from infants within 6 hours of
birth correlated with birth weight (r = 0.59, p less than 0.01). After
birth, the leptin levels of infants large for gestational age and for
those of appropriate size for gestational age significantly decreased to
levels found in infants small for gestational age within 72 hours of
delivery (p less than 0.05). Beyond 72 hours after birth, no significant
differences in leptin levels were observed among the 3 groups, and low
levels continued to 7 days of age. Harigaya et al. (1997) concluded that
leptin levels correlated with fetal weight gain. Koistinen et al. (1997)
found that leptin levels correlated closely with both absolute and
relative birth weights (r = 0.71; p less than 0.001 in both), cord blood
insulin (176730) levels (r = 0.67; P less than 0.001), and with
placental weight (r = 0.60; p less than 0.001). They concluded that
leptin is synthesized in utero, and that the circulating leptin level
relates to the intrauterine growth pattern.

Jaquet et al. (1998) investigated the ontogeny of serum leptin
concentrations during the second half of gestation and at birth in small
for gestational age and normal fetuses and newborns. Serum leptin
concentrations were measured in arterial cord blood of 79 fetuses and
132 newborns, with or without intrauterine growth retardation, at 18 to
42 weeks' gestation. Serum leptin was detectable in fetal cord blood in
all subjects as early as 18 weeks' gestation and increased dramatically
after 34 weeks' gestation. In newborns, serum leptin concentrations were
positively correlated with body weight (p less than 0.001) and body mass
index (p less than 0.001). Newborns with intrauterine growth retardation
had significantly lower serum leptin values (p less than 0.001) than
those with normal growth, and leptin levels were only positively
correlated with body mass index (p less than 0.001). The authors
concluded that the development of adipose tissue and the accumulation of
fat mass are the major determinants of fetal and neonatal serum leptin
levels. A gender difference, with higher leptin concentrations in female
fetuses, seen in the last weeks of gestation and confirmed at birth
regardless of growth status, suggested that a sexual dimorphism exists
in utero.

Chehab et al. (1996) demonstrated that administration of recombinant
leptin to female ob/ob mice can correct their sterility, resulting in
ovulation, pregnancy, and parturition. To investigate theories that the
onset of puberty is triggered by the attainment of a critical amount
and/or distribution of fat, Mantzoros et al. (1997) examined whether
changes in circulating leptin levels could represent the hormonal signal
responsible for triggering the onset of puberty in humans. Compared to
baseline prepubertal levels (8 months before the onset of puberty, as
defined by the initial rise in testosterone above the detection limit of
the assay), leptin levels rose by approximately 50% just before the
onset of puberty and decreased to approximately baseline values after
the initiation of puberty (p less than 0.01), remaining stable for over
2 years. While these changes are consistent with the hypothesis that
leptin is an important signal responsible for triggering the onset of
puberty, the stimulus for a surge in leptin levels just before the onset
of puberty is currently unknown.

Saad et al. (1997) studied plasma leptin levels in 267 subjects (106
with normal glucose tolerance, 102 with impaired glucose tolerance, and
59 with noninsulin-dependent diabetes). Fasting plasma leptin levels
ranged from 1.8 to 79.6 ng/mL, were higher in the obese subjects, and
were not related to glucose tolerance. Women had approximately 40%
higher leptin levels than men at any level of adiposity. After
controlling for body fat, postmenopausal women still had higher leptin
levels than men of similar age; their levels were not different from
those of younger women. Multiple regression analysis showed that
adiposity, gender, and insulinemia were significant determinants of
leptin concentration, explaining 42%, 28%, and 2% of its variance,
respectively. Neither age nor the waist/hip ratio was significantly
related to leptin concentration. Their data indicated that gender is a
major determinant of the plasma leptin concentration. This sex
difference is not apparently explained by sex hormones or body fat
distribution. The sexual dimorphism of leptin suggests that women may be
resistant to its putative lipostatic actions and that it may have a
reproductive function. Matkovic et al. (1997) studied body composition,
serum leptin levels, and the timing of menarche in 343 pubertal females
over 4 years. Leptin was strongly associated with body fat (r = 0.81; p
less than 0.0001) and change in body fat (r = 0.58; p less than 0.0001).
The rise in serum leptin to the level of 12.2 ng/mL (95% CI, 7.2-16.7)
was associated with the decline in age at menarche. An increase of 1
ng/mL in serum leptin lowered the age at menarche by 1 month. Matkovic
et al. (1997) concluded that a critical blood leptin level is necessary
to trigger reproductive ability in women, suggesting a threshold effect.

Verploegen et al. (1997) used site-directed mutagenesis to construct a
series of point mutations in human leptin involving single amino acid
residues that are critical for receptor binding and biologic activity.
An arg128-to-gln (R128Q) substitution does not affect receptor binding
but knocks out biologic activity. Repeated injection of leptin R128Q in
normal C57BL/6J mice resulted in progressive increase in body weight,
demonstrating that R128Q is able to interfere with the negative feedback
control of endogenous leptin.

Welt et al. (2004) administered recombinant leptin to 8 women with
hypothalamic amenorrhea due to strenuous exercise or low weight. The
treatment increased mean luteinizing hormone levels and luteinizing
hormone pulse frequency after 2 weeks and increased maximal follicular
diameter, the number of dominant follicles, ovarian volume, and
estradiol levels over a period of 3 months. Three patients had an
ovulatory menstrual cycle (p less than 0.05 compared to the expected
rate of spontaneous ovulation of 10%); 2 others had preovulatory
follicular development and withdrawal bleeding during treatment (p less
than 0.05). Recombinant leptin significantly increased levels of free
triiodothyronine, free thyroxine, insulin-like growth factor I (IGF1;
147440), insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3 (IGFBP3; 146732),
bone alkaline phosphatase, and osteocalcin (112260), but not cortisol,
corticotropin, or urinary N-telopeptide. Welt et al. (2004) suggested
that leptin is required for normal reproductive and neuroendocrine
function.

Leptin may stimulate prostate growth and angiogenesis, and receptors for
leptin are present in the prostate. To determine if leptin is associated
with increased risk of prostate cancer, Stattin et al. (2001) identified
149 men with prostate cancer (together with 298 matched referents) who
had participated in population-based health surveys in Northern Sweden
before diagnosis. Leptin, insulin (176730), IGF1, IGFBP1 (146730),
IGFBP2 (146731), IGFBP3, testosterone, and sex hormone-binding globulin
(182205) were analyzed in stored samples. Relative risk estimates (95%
confidence intervals) of prostate cancer over the quintiles of leptin
were 1.0, 2.1 (1.1-4.1), 2.6 (1.4-4.8), 1.4 (0.7-2.7), and 1.6
(0.8-3.2). Adjustments for metabolic variables, testosterone, and IGF
and its binding proteins did not attenuate this increased risk. The
authors concluded that moderately elevated plasma leptin concentrations
are associated with later development of prostate cancer. This may be
due to direct effects of leptin on prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia
lesions, or to indirect actions through other mechanisms.

Haffner et al. (1997) examined the relation of leptin levels to sex
hormone-binding globulin, total and free testosterone,
dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, estradiol, and cortisol in 87
normoglycemic men. Leptin levels were significantly correlated with free
testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin, total testosterone and
cortisol. However, after adjustment for body mass index (or,
alternatively, waist or hip circumference), leptin concentrations were
not found to be significantly related to sex hormones or cortisol. The
authors concluded that sex hormones are not important independent
modifiers of leptin concentrations in men.

Schubring et al. (1997) correlated the leptin concentrations in the
mother and the newborn with birth weight, placental weight, and maternal
weight at term. Placental weight correlated inversely with leptin levels
in maternal serum at birth, and leptin levels in cord blood correlated
positively with birth weight and placental weight. In contrast, there
was no correlation between maternal serum leptin levels and birth
weight. Thus, leptin levels are high in the fetus and in the mother at
term. The authors hypothesized that high leptin levels represent an
important feedback modulator of substrate supply and subsequently for
adipose tissue status during late gestation.

Matkovic et al. (1997) studied the circadian rhythmicity of the serum
leptin level in young females to determine if changes in body fat stores
during growth affect nocturnal increases in serum leptin levels.
Significant rises at midnight and 0400 hr suggested a diurnal variation
in serum leptin concentrations. They also found an inverse correlation
between relative total body fat and the average daytime serum leptin
level. The authors concluded that if a nocturnal rise in serum leptin is
absent over time, it may have implications for the development of
obesity, presumably by inadequate suppression of nighttime appetite.

Lonnqvist et al. (1995) found overexpression of the human OB gene in
subcutaneous and omental adipose tissue in massively obese persons.
Hamilton et al. (1995) likewise reported that OB mRNA expression is
elevated in ex vivo omental adipocytes isolated from massively obese
humans despite the absence of an identifiable mutation in the OB gene.
This led them to speculate that this increased expression results from
an insensitivity to the putative regulatory function(s) of the OB gene
product. Maffei et al. (1995) found that mice with lesions of the
hypothalamus, as well as mice mutant at the db locus, expressed a
20-fold higher level of ob RNA in adipose tissue. These data suggested
that both the db gene (LEPR; 601007) and the hypothalamus are downstream
of the ob gene in the pathway that regulates adipose tissue mass and are
consistent with previous experiments, suggesting that the db locus
encodes the ob receptor.

Weigle et al. (1997) examined the correlation of plasma leptin and body
mass index (BMI) in an ethnically mixed population, a group of subjects
with the Prader-Willi syndrome (176270), and a group of
Japanese-American subjects who underwent computerized tomographic
measurement of adipose tissue cross-sectional areas. Highly significant
and indistinguishable linear relationships between plasma leptin levels
and BMI were found in all 3 study groups. The circulating leptin level
reflects total adipose tissue mass rather than a combination of adipose
tissue mass and distribution, and Prader-Willi syndrome does not alter
the relationship between these 2 variables.

Chen et al. (1996) induced sustained hyperleptinemia for 28 days in
normal Wistar rats by infusing a recombinant adenovirus containing the
rat leptin cDNA. Hyperleptinemic rats exhibited a 30 to 50% reduction in
food intake and gained only 22 g over the experimental period versus 115
to 132 g in control animals that received saline infusions or a
recombinant virus containing the beta-galactosidase gene. Body fat was
absent in hyperleptinemic rats, whereas control rats pair-fed to the
hyperleptinemic rats retained approximately 50% body fat. Further,
plasma triglycerides and insulin levels were significantly lower in
hyperleptinemic versus pair-fed controls, while fatty acid and glucose
levels were similar in the 2 groups, suggestive of enhanced insulin
sensitivity in the hyperleptinemic animals. Thus, despite equivalent
reduction in food intake and weight gain in hyperleptinemic and pair-fed
animals, identifiable fat tissue was completely ablated only in the
former group, raising a possibility of a specific lipoatrophic activity
for leptin.

Kennedy et al. (1997) studied the relationship of leptin to metabolic
abnormalities associated with obesity. To do this, 116 subjects (62 men
and 54 women) with a wide range of body weight (BMI, 17 to 54 kg/m2),
were characterized with regard to body composition, glucose intolerance,
insulin sensitivity, energy expenditure, substrate utilization, and
blood pressure. Their data indicated that there are important
gender-based differences in the regulation and action of leptin in
humans. Serum leptin levels increase with progressive obesity in both
men and women. However, for any given measure of obesity, leptin levels
are higher in women than in men, consistent with a state of relative
leptin resistance. The authors concluded that these findings have
implications regarding differences in body composition between men and
women. Furthermore, their observation that serum leptin levels are not
related to energy expenditure rates suggests that leptin regulates body
fat predominantly by altering eating behavior rather than calorigenesis.

The circulating peptide leptin had been reported to be secreted by
adipocytes and by placenta (Masuzaki et al., 1997). Bado et al. (1998)
showed that leptin mRNA and leptin protein are present in rat gastric
epithelium, and that cells in glands of the gastric fundic mucosa are
immunoreactive for leptin. Both feeding and administration of CCK-8, the
biologically active C-terminal end of cholecystokinin (CCK; 118440),
resulted in a rapid and large decrease in both leptin cell
immunoreactivity and the leptin content of the fundic epithelium, with a
concomitant increase in the concentration of leptin in the plasma. These
results indicated that gastric leptin may be involved in the early
CCK-mediated effects activated by food intake, possibly including
satiety.

Niswender et al. (2001) demonstrated that systemic administration of
leptin in rat activates the enzyme phosphatidylinositol-3-hydroxykinase
(see 171834) in the hypothalamus and that intracerebroventricular
infusion of inhibitors of this enzyme prevents leptin-induced anorexia.
They concluded that phosphatidylinositol-3-hydroxykinase is a crucial
enzyme in the signal transduction pathway that links hypothalamic leptin
to reduced food intake.

Nutritional deprivation suppresses immune function. Mice defective in
leptin (ob/ob) or its receptor (db/db) have impaired T-cell immunity.
Impaired cell-mediated immunity and reduced levels of leptin are both
features of low body weight in humans. Indeed, malnutrition predisposes
to death from infectious diseases. Lord et al. (1998) reported that
leptin has a specific effect on T-lymphocyte responses, differentially
regulating the proliferation of naive and memory T cells. Administration
of leptin to mice reversed the immunosuppressive effects of acute
starvation. Thus leptin has a role in linking nutritional status to
cognate cellular immune function, and provides a molecular mechanism to
account for the immune dysfunction observed in starvation.

Leptin, initially discovered as a regulator of food intake and energy
expenditure, emerged subsequently as a pleiotropic molecule with a
variety of physiologic and pathologic roles. Alterations in leptin
levels and/or in the responsiveness to leptin were reported not only
during starvation and obesity, but also in patients affected by
diabetes, renal failure, hypothyroidism, and AIDS. T lymphocytes and
cytokines are critical mediators of hepatic inflammation in patients
affected by viral, allergic, autoimmune, and possibly alcoholic liver
disease. Faggioni et al. (2000) demonstrated that leptin plays an
important role in T cell-mediated liver toxicity in association with a
regulatory effect on thymus and peripheral blood cellularity as well as
on the production of 2 proinflammatory cytokines, TNF-alpha (191160) and
IL18 (600953).

Sierra-Honigmann et al. (1998) demonstrated that the leptin receptor
(601007), although expressed primarily in the hypothalamus, is also
expressed in human vasculature and in primary cultures of human
endothelial cells. In vitro and in vivo assays revealed that leptin has
angiogenic activity. In vivo, leptin induced neovascularization in
corneas from normal rats but not in corneas from fa/fa Zucker rats,
which lack functional leptin receptors. These observations indicated
that the vascular endothelium is a target for leptin and suggested a
physiologic mechanism whereby leptin-induced angiogenesis may facilitate
increased energy expenditure.

Friedman and Halaas (1998) provided a comprehensive review of the role
of leptin in the regulation of body weight in mammals. Auwerx and Staels
(1998) also provided an extensive review. Rosenbaum and Leibel (1999)
reviewed the role of leptin in human physiology.

Wellhoener et al. (2000) tested the hypothesis that in humans leptin
secretion is primarily regulated by glucose uptake and only secondarily
by plasma insulin (176730) and glucose. In 30 lean and healthy men they
induced 4 experimental conditions by using the blood glucose clamp
technique. Multiple regression analysis revealed a significant effect of
circulating insulin (low vs high insulin; p = 0.001) and blood glucose
(hypoglycemia vs euglycemia; p = 0.001) on the rise of serum leptin.
However, when the total amount of dextrose infused during the clamp
(grams of dextrose per kg BW) was included into the regression model,
this variable was significantly related to the changes in serum leptin
(p = 0.001), whereas circulating insulin and glucose had no additional
effect. The authors concluded that their findings in humans support
previous in vitro data that leptin secretion is mainly related to
glucose metabolism.

Both serum leptin and bone mineral density (BMD) are positively
correlated with body fat, generating the hypothesis that leptin may be a
systemic and/or local regulator of bone mass. To evaluate the
relationship between serum leptin concentrations and bone mass in women,
Pasco et al. (2001) measured bone mineral content, projected bone area,
body fat mass, and fasting serum leptin in 214 healthy, nonobese
Australian women aged 20 to 91 years. The authors demonstrated an
association between serum leptin levels and bone mass consistent with
the hypothesis that circulating leptin may play a role in regulating
bone mass.

To assess whether leptin is an independent predictor of BMD in
postmenopausal women, Blain et al. (2002) studied the relationships of
BMD to serum leptin, 25(OH)D, 1,25(OH)2D, parathyroid hormone (PTH;
168450), estrogen (E2), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, growth hormone
(GH; 139250), IGF1, creatinine clearance, calcium intake, fat mass, and
lean mass in 107 women aged 50 to 90 years. They also related serum
leptin to markers of bone formation (serum bone alkaline phosphatase and
osteocalcin (112260)) and resorption (urine C-telopeptide of type I
collagen). In stepwise multiple linear regression, lean mass explained
28.5%, age 10.3%, and leptin 7.2% of the whole body BMD variance. The
authors concluded that these data demonstrate that leptin is an
independent predictor of whole body and femoral neck BMD in
postmenopausal women. They suggested that although the relationships
between leptin and markers of bone formation appear complex, leptin may
exert a protective effect on bone by limiting the excessive bone
resorption coupled to bone formation associated with bone loss after
menopause.

Takeda et al. (2002) showed in mice that hypothalamic leptin-dependent
antiosteogenic and anorexigenic networks differ, and that the peripheral
mediators of leptin antiosteogenic function appear to be neuronal.
Neuropeptides mediating leptin anorexigenic function did not affect bone
formation. Leptin deficiency resulted in low sympathetic tone, and
genetic or pharmacologic ablation of adrenergic signaling led to a
leptin-resistant high bone mass. Beta-adrenergic receptors on
osteoblasts regulate their proliferation, and a beta-adrenergic agonist
decreased bone mass in leptin-deficient and wildtype mice, while a
beta-adrenergic antagonist increased bone mass in wildtype and
ovariectomized mice. None of these manipulations affected body weight.
This study demonstrated a leptin-dependent neuronal regulation of bone
formation with potential therapeutic implications for osteoporosis.

Minokoshi et al. (2002) demonstrated that leptin selectively stimulates
phosphorylation and activation of the alpha-2 catalytic subunit of AMPK
(AMPK-alpha-2; 600497) in skeletal muscle, thus establishing an
additional signaling pathway for leptin. Early activation of AMPK occurs
by leptin acting directly on muscle, whereas later activation depends on
leptin functioning through the hypothalamic-sympathetic nervous system
axis. In parallel with its activation of AMPK, leptin suppresses the
activity of ACC (200350, 601557), thereby stimulating the oxidation of
fatty acids in muscle. Blocking AMPK activation inhibits the
phosphorylation of ACC stimulated by leptin. Minokoshi et al. (2002)
concluded that their data identify AMPK as a principal mediator of the
effects of leptin on fatty acid metabolism in muscle.

Sooranna et al. (2001) determined the plasma leptin concentrations in
twin pregnancies in relation to chorionicity and discordant fetal growth
by studying 53 twin pregnancies of which 26 had growth discordance of at
least 20% and 27 were concordant for growth, defined as discordance of
10% or less. Regardless of chorionicity, plasma leptin concentrations in
the intrauterine growth-restricted twins were 2-fold lower than their
cotwins with normal growth.

Shanley et al. (2002) demonstrated that leptin inhibits hippocampal
neurons via phosphoinositide 3-kinase-driven activation of
large-conductance, calcium-activated potassium channels (PK channels),
but not KATP channels.

To examine the mechanism underlying leptin's metabolic actions, Cohen et
al. (2002) used transcription profiling to identify leptin-regulated
genes in ob/ob liver. Leptin was found to specifically repress RNA
levels and enzymatic activity of hepatic stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD;
604031), which catalyzes the biosynthesis of monounsaturated fatty
acids. Mice lacking Scd1 were lean and hypermetabolic; ob/ob mice with
mutations in Scd1 were significantly less obese than ob/ob controls and
had markedly increased energy expenditure. Ob/ob mice with mutations in
Scd1 had histologically normal livers with significantly reduced
triglyceride storage and VLDL production. Cohen et al. (2002) concluded
that downregulation of SCD1 is an important component of leptin's
metabolic actions.

Using male Sprague-Dawley rats implanted with third
intracerebroventricular cannulae, Zhao et al. (2002) found that
cilostamide, a phosphodiesterase-3 (PDE3B; 602047) inhibitor, reversed
the established effects of leptin on food intake and body weight;
blocked, at the hypothalamic level, the leptin-induced tyrosine
phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription-3
(STAT3; 102582); and blocked the DNA binding of STAT3 protein. In
addition, Zhao et al. (2002) showed that intracerebroventricular
administration of leptin increased hypothalamic phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase (PI3K; see 601232) and PDE3B activities and decreased cAMP
concentration. Zhao et al. (2002) concluded that a PI3K-PDE3B-cAMP
pathway interacting with the JAK2 (147796)-STAT3 pathway constitutes a
critical component of leptin signaling in the hypothalamus.

Dumond et al. (2003) demonstrated leptin in synovial fluid obtained from
osteoarthritis (165720)-affected joints, and showed that leptin
concentrations correlated with a body mass index. Marked expression of
the protein was observed in osteoarthritic cartilage and in osteophytes,
while in normal cartilage few chondrocytes produced leptin. The pattern
and level of leptin expression were related to the grade of cartilage
destruction and paralleled those of growth factors IGF1 and TGFB1
(190180). Animal studies showed that leptin strongly stimulated anabolic
functions of chondrocytes and induced the synthesis of IGF1 and TGFB1 in
cartilage at both the mRNA and the protein levels. The findings were
interpreted as suggesting a new peripheral function of leptin as a key
regulator of chondrocyte metabolism, and indicated that leptin may play
an important role in the pathophysiology of osteoarthritis.

Minokoshi et al. (2004) investigated the potential role of AMP-activated
protein kinase (AMPK; see 602739) in the hypothalamus in the regulation
of food intake. Minokoshi et al. (2004) reported that AMPK activity is
inhibited in arcuate and paraventricular hypothalamus by the
anorexigenic hormone leptin, and in multiple hypothalamic regions by
insulin (176730), high glucose, and refeeding. A melanocortin receptor
(see 155555) agonist, a potent anorexigen, decreased AMPK activity in
paraventricular hypothalamus, whereas agouti-related protein (602311),
an orexigen, increased AMPK activity. Melanocortin receptor signaling is
required for leptin and refeeding effects of AMPK in the paraventricular
hypothalamus. Dominant-negative AMPK expression in the hypothalamus was
sufficient to reduce food intake and body weight, whereas constitutively
active AMPK increased both. Alterations of hypothalamic AMPK activity
augmented changes in arcuate neuropeptide expression induced by fasting
and feeding. Furthermore, inhibition of hypothalamic AMPK is necessary
for leptin's effects on food intake and body weight, as constitutively
active AMPK blocks these effects. Thus, Minokoshi et al. (2004)
concluded that hypothalamic AMPK plays a critical role in hormonal and
nutrient-derived anorexigenic and orexigenic signals and in energy
balance.

Leptin is a powerful inhibitor of bone formation in vivo. This
antiosteogenic function involves leptin binding to its receptors on
ventromedial hypothalamic neurons, the autonomous nervous system, and
beta-adrenergic receptors on osteoblasts. To clarify the mechanism
whereby leptin controls the function of ventromedial hypothalamic
antiosteogenic neurons, Elefteriou et al. (2004) compared the ability of
leptin to regulate body weight and bone mass and showed that leptin
antiosteogenic and anorexigenic functions are affected by similar
amounts of leptin. Elefteriou et al. (2004) generated mice with knockin
of the LacZ gene in the leptin locus. They failed to detect any leptin
synthesis in the central nervous system of the knockin mice. However,
increasing serum leptin level, even dramatically, reduced bone mass.
Conversely, reducing serum-free leptin level by overexpressing a soluble
receptor for leptin increased bone mass. Congruent with these results,
the high bone mass of lipodystrophic mice could be corrected by
restoring serum leptin level, suggesting that leptin is an adipocyte
product both necessary and sufficient to control bone mass. Consistent
with the high bone mass phenotype of lipodystrophic mice, Elefteriou et
al. (2004) observed an advanced bone age, an indirect reflection of
premature bone formation, in lipodystrophic patients. Taken together,
these results indicated that adipocyte-derived circulating leptin is a
determinant of bone formation and suggested that leptin antiosteogenic
function is conserved in vertebrates. Ethical considerations prevented
the collection of bone biopsies from the prepubertal patients affected
by congenital generalized lipodystrophy. Because of these limitations,
Elefteriou et al. (2004) used the osseous age of the patients as an
indirect but suggestive indicator of bone formation. All patients showed
low to undetectable circulating levels of leptin and had, regardless of
their sex, a marked advance in bone age. The same advance in bone age
was also observed in a single leptin-deficient child.

By analyzing Adrb2 (109690)-deficient mice, Elefteriou et al. (2005)
demonstrated that the sympathetic nervous system favors bone resorption
by increasing expression in osteoblast progenitor cells of the
osteoclast differentiation factor Rankl (602642). This sympathetic
function requires phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA; see 176911)
of ATF4 (604064), a cell-specific CREB (123810)-related transcription
factor essential for osteoblast differentiation and function. That bone
resorption cannot increase in gonadectomized Adrb2-deficient mice
highlights the biologic importance of this regulation, but also
contrasts sharply with the increase in bone resorption characterizing
another hypogonadic mouse with low sympathetic tone, the ob/ob mouse.
This discrepancy is explained, in part, by the fact that CART (602606),
a neuropeptide whose expression is controlled by leptin and nearly
abolished in ob/ob mice, inhibits bone resorption by modulating Rankl
expression. Elefteriou et al. (2005) concluded that their study
established that leptin-regulated neural pathways control both aspects
of bone remodeling, and demonstrated that integrity of sympathetic
signaling is necessary for the increase in bone resorption caused by
gonadal failure.

Cohen (2006) reviewed the role of leptin in regulating appetite,
neuroendocrine function, and bone remodeling, and discussed the
downstream pathways, e.g., the melanocortin system and the sympathetic
nervous system, that are involved in those effects.

Using leptin-affinity chromatography, mass spectrometry, and
immunochemical analysis, Chen et al. (2006) found that C-reactive
protein (CRP; 123260) is a major leptin-interacting protein. In vitro
studies showed that human CRP directly inhibited the binding of leptin
to its receptor and blocked cellular signaling. Infusion of human CRP
into ob/ob mice blocked the effects of leptin on satiety and weight
reduction, and the actions of human leptin were blunted in mice
expressing human CRP. Further in vitro studies in human primary
hepatocytes showed that physiologic levels of leptin stimulated
expression of CRP. Chen et al. (2006) suggested that so-called 'leptin
resistance,' which may play a role in obesity, may be mediated by
circulating CRP that binds leptin and attenuates its physiologic
functions. Farooqi and O'Rahilly (2007) found no significant differences
in CRP levels between 4 congenitally leptin-deficient children and 20
age- and adiposity-matched obese children without leptin deficiency.
Mean concentrations of CRP remained unchanged after 2 months and 6
months of daily subcutaneous injections of recombinant human leptin in
the children with congenital leptin deficiency. Because leptin repletion
in humans congenitally lacking leptin does not increase circulating CRP,
Farooqi and O'Rahilly (2007) suggested that the leptin-stimulated
increase in CRP mRNA and protein levels in primary human hepatocytes
reported by Chen et al. (2006) is unlikely to be physiologically
relevant.

Chan et al. (2006) assessed pituitary hormone pulsatility and hormone
levels of several neuroendocrine axes and markers of immune function in
7 normal-weight women during a normoleptinemic-fed condition and 2
hypoleptinemic 72-hour fasting states. Administration of recombinant
human leptin during fasting fully restored leptin to physiologic levels
and reversed the fasting-associated decrease in overnight luteinizing
hormone pulse frequency, but had no effect on fasting-induced changes in
thyroid-stimulating hormone pulsatility, thyroid and IGF1 hormone
levels, and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal and renin-aldosterone
activity. FSH and sex steroid levels were not altered. Short-term
reduction of leptin levels decreased the number of circulating cells of
the adaptive immune response, but recombinant leptin did not have major
effects on their number or in vitro function. Chan et al. (2006)
concluded that changes in leptin levels within the physiologic range
have no major physiologic effects in leptin-replete humans.

Buettner et al. (2008) infused leptin into the mediobasal hypothalamus
(MBH) of rats and observed STAT3-independent inhibition of white adipose
tissue (WAT) lipogenesis; correspondingly, mice with a mutant Y1138
leptin receptor (601007) that fails to activate Stat3 (s/s mice) had
reduced adipose mass compared to db/db mice. Hypothalamic leptin
suppression of WAT lipogenesis in rats was lost when PIK3 (see 171833)
signaling was prevented and after sympathetic denervation of adipose
tissue. MBH leptin suppressed the endocannabinoid anandamide in WAT, and
when this suppression of endocannabinoid tone was prevented by systemic
Cnr1 (114610) activation, MBH leptin failed to suppress WAT lipogenesis.
The authors suggested that the increased endocannabinoid tone observed
in obesity is linked to a failure of central leptin signaling to
restrain peripheral endocannabinoids.

Using a constitutively active mutant of the mouse nonreceptor tyrosine
phosphatase Shp2 (PTPN11; 176876), He et al. (2012) found that Shp2
integrated leptin and estrogen signaling in transgenic female mice.
Transgenic females, but not males, were resistant to high-fat
diet-induced obesity and liver steatosis via enhanced leptin and insulin
sensitivity and downstream ERK activation. SHP2 and estrogen
receptor-alpha (ESR1; 133430) interacted directly in MCF-7 cells and
female mouse tissues, and the interaction was enhanced by estrogen
stimulation. Ovariectomy of transgenic mice reversed their resistance to
high-fat diet-induced obesity.

- Gene-Environment Interaction

Prenatal famine in humans has been associated with various consequences
in later life, depending on the gestational timing of the insult and the
sex of the exposed individual. Epigenetic mechanisms have been proposed
to underlie these associations. Tobi et al. (2009) investigated the
methylation of 15 loci implicated in growth and metabolic disease in
individuals who were prenatally exposed to war-time famine in the
Netherlands from 1944 to 1945. Methylation of INSIGF (see INS, 176730),
which is an alternately spliced read-through transcript of INS and IGF2
(147470), was lower among 60 individuals who were periconceptionally
exposed to the famine compared to 60 of their unexposed same-sex sibs,
whereas methylation of IL10 (124092), LEP, ABCA1 (600046), GNASAS
(610540) and MEG3 (605636) was higher than control. A significant
interaction with sex was observed for INSIGF, LEP, and GNASAS. When
methylation of 8 representative loci was compared between 62 individuals
exposed late in gestation and 62 of their unexposed sibs, methylation
was different for GNASAS in both men and women, and LEP methylation was
different in men only. Tobi et al. (2009) concluded that persistent
changes in DNA methylation may be a common consequence of prenatal
famine exposure, and that these changes may depend on the sex of the
exposed individual and the gestational timing of the exposure.

EVOLUTION

To understand the evolutionary history of the gene region containing the
leptin gene, Moffett et al. (2002) genotyped 1,957 individuals from 12
world populations for a highly variable tetranucleotide repeat
polymorphism located 476 bp 3-prime of exon 3 of the leptin gene. The
data revealed a common set of alleles shared among world populations,
presumed to have arisen from a great ape ancestral allele before
divergence of the major geographic subdivisions of the human population,
a subset of alleles specific to populations of African ancestry, and a
second set of alleles that arose by tandem duplication of the core
repeat unit following the separation of African and non-African
populations. These findings emphasized the complex evolutionary history
of this locus and raised cautions about the pooling of alleles at this
locus in association studies.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Leptin Deficiency

In 2 obese children from a consanguineous Pakistani family with leptin
deficiency and morbid obesity (614962), Montague et al. (1997) detected
homozygosity for a single-basepair deletion in the LEP gene
(164160.0001).

Farooqi et al. (2001) examined 13 subjects who were heterozygous for the
frameshift mutation delta-G133 (164160.0001). Serum leptin levels and
anthropometric measurements in these subjects were compared with those
in 96 ethnically matched controls with a similar sex distribution and
age. Serum leptin concentrations in heterozygotes for the mutation were
markedly lower than in controls. These were positively correlated with
BMI in control subjects and in wildtype relatives of the heterozygotes.
In contrast there was no significant correlation between BMI and serum
leptin in the delta-G133 heterozygotes. Lower leptin levels in the
delta-G133 heterozygotes were accompanied by an increased prevalence of
obesity, with 76% of heterozygotes having a BMI greater than 30 compared
with 26% of controls. Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry in 12 of the
heterozygotes and in 6 Pakistani subjects who were wildtype at the
leptin locus indicated that the mean measured percentage of body fat was
similar to the predicted value in wildtype subjects; however, in the
heterozygotes it significantly exceeded the predicted proportion of body
fat, with all 12 heterozygous individuals showing a deviation in the
same direction. Farooqi et al. (2001) concluded that a relatively small
drop in leptin production may be sensed by the homeostatic feedback
system that controls energy balance, with fat mass being increased in an
attempt to restore leptin levels to some 'set point.'

- Polymorphism

Considine et al. (1995) studied OB gene expression in abdominal
subcutaneous adipocytes from lean and obese humans. The full coding
region of the OB gene was isolated from a human adipocyte cDNA library.
They detected no difference in the sequence of an RT-PCR product of the
coding region from 5 lean and 5 obese subjects. The nonsense mutation in
the ob mouse that results in the conversion of arginine-105 to a stop
codon was not present in human obesity. In all 10 human cDNAs,
arginine-105 was encoded by CGG; consequently, 2 nucleotide
substitutions would be required to result in a stop codon. Whereas the
mutations in the ob mouse cause absence of the signaling protein and
result in overeating, OB gene expression in humans was, in fact, 72%
greater in 8 obese subjects than in 8 lean controls.

Hager et al. (1997) screened patients with morbid obesity for mutations
in the leptin gene and for association with a polymorphism in the
5-prime untranslated region of the gene. The patients studied had low
leptin levels and the same group had shown evidence for linkage of the
LEP gene with morbid obesity. Although no polymorphisms were detected in
the coding region of the gene, a single A-to-G transition was found in
nucleotide 26 of the untranslated first exon. This base exchange created
a new restriction site which was used in the study of 199 morbidly obese
individuals and in 153 lean controls. Under a codominant or recessive
model, the variant was positively associated with morbid obesity (p =
0.01 and p = 0.0027, respectively). In metabolic studies, they showed
that patients homozygous for the G allele of the exon 1 variant had
significantly lower fasting leptin levels compared to subjects being
either heterozygous (AG) or homozygous for the A allele despite a
similar BMI (p = 0.01).

Karvonen et al. (1998) investigated the LEP gene for variants by
screening both its putative promoter and its coding region in 200 obese
Finnish subjects (BMI greater than 27 kg/m2). PCR-amplified DNA samples
were subjected to single-strand conformation analysis. A 144G-A
transition in codon 48 and a 328G-A transition in codon 110 were
identified in 2 obese subjects, both of whom had very low serum leptin
levels. A rare silent polymorphism (538C-T) was detected 33 basepairs
downstream of the translation stop codon (TGA), and a common
polymorphism (19A-G) was identified in the untranslated exon 1. This
polymorphism was not associated with obesity and the allele frequencies
were similar between 64 normal-weight and 141 obese Finns. The authors
concluded that there is no common LEP gene variation associated with
obesity.

On the basis of studies of adipose tissue obtained from 94 adult obese
subjects and from 6 children who had developed obesity after surgery in
the hypothalamic region, Carlsson et al. (1997) reported studies of
total mRNA for the OB gene as examined by RT-PCR. Sequencing of the
coding region of the gene detected no mutations and gene expression was
detectable in all subjects. None of the subjects had an extreme
overexpression. There was no systematic increase in overt expression in
obese children with hypothalamic disease compared to their healthy
brothers and sisters. Carlsson et al. (1997) concluded that OB gene
defects are rare in human obesity.

Lucantoni et al. (2000) screened 205 obese patients for presence of the
A19G polymorphism; 61 normal-weight controls were also screened to
compare polymorphism frequency. No significant differences in genotype
distribution between control and obese subjects were found. No
significant correlations were found between this polymorphism and serum
leptin levels and the other parameters considered.

Mammes et al. (1998) identified 8 genetic variants in the 5-prime region
of the LEP gene. One of the mutations, 2548G-A (wrongly designated
2549C-A at that time), was associated with a difference in BMI reduction
following a low calorie diet in overweight women. Li et al. (1999) found
the same polymorphism associated with extreme obesity in women. Mammes
et al. (2000) genotyped a new sample from the general population
including 314 normal weight and 109 overweight subjects. The genotype
and allele frequencies were significantly different between groups, with
the G allele being more frequent in the overweight subjects (p less than
0.01). In men, carriers of this allele had lower leptin concentrations
adjusted for fat mass. The results indicated that variations at the
leptin locus are associated with common obesity phenotypes, and not only
with extreme obesity or the rare mendelian obesity syndromes.

Shintani et al. (2002) examined the genetic association of a leptin gene
polymorphism with obesity, insulin resistance, and hypertension. A
highly polymorphic tetranucleotide repeat polymorphism in the
3-prime-flanking region of the leptin gene was examined. The alleles of
the polymorphism consisted of 2 groups with different size
distributions: a shorter one (class I) and a longer one (class II). The
frequency of class I/class I genotype was much higher in hypertensive
subjects than in control subjects (13.5% vs 3.4%; p = 0.0027). No
significant difference in BMI was observed with different genotypes in
either patients with hypertension or control subjects. The authors
concluded that the leptin gene polymorphism was associated with
hypertension independent of obesity.

In a search for QTLs for BMI, Feitosa et al. (2002) reported a combined
multipoint lod score of 4.9 for 2 markers on chromosome 7q32.3 (see
606641) in families participating in the National Heart, Lung, and Blood
Institute Family Heart Study. The LEP gene is positioned near the
linkage peak. Jiang et al. (2004) employed family-based tests of
association with both a quantitative measure of BMI adjusted for age and
sex and a dichotomously defined obesity trait. A number of SNPs spanning
240 kb around the LEP gene showed association in men, but not in women,
for both the quantitative and qualitative trait definitions. A 5-marker
haplotype located 2 kb 5-prime of the previously reported LEP promoter
region and spanning approximately 1.2 kb had a frequency of 49% in this
sample, and was overtransmitted to obese offspring (p = 0.00005). All 5
of the SNPs were predicted to modify transcription factor binding sites.
Jiang et al. (2004) concluded that their results suggested that there
are functional variants in an extended promoter region of LEP.

Gaukrodger et al. (2005) examined the impact of both common and rare
polymorphisms of the LEP gene on blood pressure, subclinical
atherosclerosis as measured by carotid intima-medial thickness, and BMI
in a large family study. They found that the rare T allele at the 538C/T
polymorphism substantially influenced pulse pressure and carotid
intima-medial thickness, but did not appear to exert this effect through
actions on plasma leptin level or BMI. This suggested that an autocrine
or paracrine effect in vascular tissue may be an important physiologic
function of leptin.

Fairfax et al. (2010) employed a combined approach of mapping protein
and expression quantitative trait loci in peripheral blood mononuclear
cells (PBMCs) using high-density SNP typing for about 2,000 loci
implicated in cardiovascular, metabolic and inflammatory syndromes.
Common SNP markers and haplotypes of the LEP gene associated with a 1.7-
to 2-fold higher level of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced IL6 (147620)
expression. Basal leptin expression significantly correlated with
LPS-induced IL6 expression, and the same LEP variants that associated
with IL6 expression were also major determinants of LEP expression in
PBMCs.

ANIMAL MODEL

Zhang et al. (1994) identified a nonsense mutation in codon 105 of the
original ob/ob mouse strain described by Ingalls et al. (1950). The
original mutation resulted in a change of arginine-105 to a stop codon.
This mutation was associated with a 20-fold increase in the expression
of ob mRNA. A second ob mutant did not synthesize ob RNA. The mutation
was thought to be a structural alteration or sequence variation in the
promoter. Taken as a whole, the data suggested that the ob gene product
may function as part of a signaling pathway from adipose tissue to a
satiety center in the central nervous system that acts to regulate the
size of the body fat depot. Of the brain regions implicated in the
regulation of feeding behavior, the ventromedial nucleus of the
hypothalamus is considered to be the most important satiety center. It
remained to be determined whether the active form of the ob protein
circulates in the blood; such was subsequently shown to be the case.
Mice heterozygous for the ob mutation have an enhanced ability to
survive a prolonged fast (Coleman, 1979). Heterozygous mutations at OB
might provide a selective advantage in human populations subjected to
caloric deprivation and in that way represent a 'thrifty gene' (Neel,
1962). Rink (1994) concluded that 'it will not have escaped the notice
of the authors or readers that cloning the ob gene may provide new and
rational approaches to the therapy of obesity.'

Ogawa et al. (1995) isolated rat ob cDNA and examined the tissue
distribution of ob gene expression in rats. It showed the rat ob gene
product, a 167-amino acid protein with a putative signal sequence, was
96% and 83% homologous to the mouse and human ob proteins, respectively.
Northern blot analysis using the rat ob cDNA probe identified a single
mRNA species of 4.5 kb in adipose tissue, while no significant amount of
ob RNA was present in other tissues in rats. The ob gene was expressed
in adipose tissue with regional specificities and in mature adipocytes
rather than in stromal-vascular cells isolated from rat adipose tissue.
Expression of the ob gene was markedly augmented in all adipose tissue
examined in Zucker 'fatty' (fa/fa) rats at this stage of established
obesity.

Frederich et al. (1995) confirmed that the adipocyte is the source of ob
mRNA in rats and mice and that the predicted 16-kD ob protein is present
in rodent serum as detected by Western blot. Both ob protein and ob mRNA
expression was markedly increased in obesity. The levels of ob protein
were elevated in serum of db/db mice, in mice with hypothalamic lesions
caused by neonatal administration of monosodium glutamate, and in mice
with brown fat ablation by means of a toxigene. (The UCP-DTA model (see
UCP1; 113730) of murine obesity was produced by transgenically
expressing the A chain of diphtheria toxin under the UCP1 promoter. No
serum ob protein could be detected in the ob/ob mice. By contrast to
obesity, starvation of normal rats and mice markedly suppressed ob mRNA
abundance, and this was reversed by refeeding.) Iida et al. (1996)
demonstrated that a gln269-to-pro mutation in the leptin receptor gene
(601007) is responsible for the obese phenotype in the Zucker fa/fa rat.

Neuropeptide Y (NPY; 162640) is a neuromodulator implicated in the
control of energy balance and is overproduced in the hypothalamus of
ob/ob mice. To determine the role of NPY in the response to leptin
deficiency, Erickson et al. (1996) generated ob/ob mice deficient in
NPY. In the absence of NPY, ob/ob mice were less obese because of
reduced food intake and increased energy expenditure, and were less
severely affected by diabetes, sterility, and somatotropic defects.
These results were interpreted as indicating that NPY is a central
effector of leptin deficiency.

Yamauchi et al. (2003) crossed leptin-deficient ob/ob mice with mice
carrying a transgene for the globular domain of adiponectin (605441).
The ob/ob mice carrying the transgene showed reduced insulin resistance,
beta-cell degranulation, and diabetes. Amelioration of diabetes and
insulin resistance was associated with increased expression of molecules
involved in fatty acid oxidation, such as acyl-CoA oxidase (609751), and
molecules involved in energy dissipation, such as uncoupling protein-2
(601693) and -3 (602044).

In a subset of obese humans, a relatively low plasma level of leptin is
found. This finding suggested that in some cases abnormal regulation of
the leptin gene in adipose tissue causes the obese state. Ioffe et al.
(1998) tested the possibility that a relative decrease in leptin
production can lead to obesity by mating animals carrying a weakly
expressed adipocyte-specific human leptin transgene to ob/ob mice, which
do not express leptin. The transgene did not contain the regulatory
elements of the leptin gene and was analogous to a circumstance in which
the cis element and/or trans factors regulating leptin RNA production
are abnormal. The ob/ob mice carrying the transgene had a plasma leptin
approximately one-half that found in normal, nontransgenic mice. These
animals were markedly obese, though not as obese as ob/ob mice without
the transgene; furthermore, the infertility and several of the endocrine
abnormalities evident in ob/ob mice were normalized in the transgenic
mice. The transgenic mice had an abnormal response when placed at an
ambient temperature of 4 degrees centigrade, suggesting that different
thresholds exist for the different biologic effects of leptin. Leptin
treatment of the transgenic mice resulted in marked weight loss with
efficacy similar to that seen after treatment of wildtype mice. In
aggregate, these data suggested that dysregulation of the leptin gene
can result in obesity with relatively normal levels of leptin and that
this form of obesity is responsive to leptin treatment.

In a mouse model of congenital generalized lipodystrophy (269700),
Shimomura et al. (1999) demonstrated that insulin resistance could be
overcome by continuous systemic infusion of low doses of recombinant
leptin, an effect that was not mimicked by chronic food restriction.
Shimomura et al. (1999) concluded that their results supported the idea
that leptin modulates insulin sensitivity and glucose disposal
independently of its effect on food intake, and that leptin deficiency
accounts for the insulin resistance found in congenital generalized
lipodystrophy.

Szczypka et al. (2000) generated mice lacking both dopamine and leptin
to determine if leptin deficiency overcomes the aphagia of
dopamine-deficient mice. Double-mutant mice became obese when treated
daily with L-DOPA, but when L-DOPA treatment was terminated the double
mutants were capable of movement but did not feed, suggesting that
dopamine is required for feeding in leptin-null mice.

Leptin acts as a potent inhibitory factor against obesity by regulating
energy expenditure, food intake, and adiposity. The obese diabetic db/db
mouse, which has defects in leptin receptor, displays enhanced neural
responses and elevated behavioral preference to sweet stimuli. Kawai et
al. (2000) showed the effects of leptin on the peripheral taste system.
The administration of leptin into lean mice suppressed responses of
peripheral taste nerves to sweet substances without affecting responses
to sour, salty, and bitter substances. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings
of activities of taste receptor cells isolated from circumvallate
papillae (innervated by the glossopharyngeal nerve) demonstrated that
leptin activated outward K+ currents, which resulted in
hyperpolarization of taste cells. The db/db mouse with impaired leptin
receptors showed no such leptin suppression. Kawai et al. (2000)
concluded that the taste organ is a peripheral target for leptin, and
that leptin may be a sweet-sensing modulator (suppressor) that may take
part in regulation of food intake.

By studying lipodystrophic (see SREBP1; 184756) and ob/ob mice,
Shimomura et al. (2000) showed that chronic hyperinsulinemia
downregulates the mRNA for IRS2 (600797), an essential component of the
insulin-signaling pathway in liver, thereby producing insulin
resistance. Despite IRS2 deficiency, insulin continues to stimulate
production of SREBP1c, a transcription factor that activates fatty acid
synthesis. The combination of insulin resistance (inappropriate
gluconeogenesis) and insulin sensitivity (elevated lipogenesis)
establishes a vicious cycle that aggravates hyperinsulinemia and insulin
resistance in lipodystrophic and ob/ob mice.

Leptin deficiency results in a complex obesity phenotype comprising both
hyperphagia and lowered metabolism. The hyperphagia results, at least in
part, from the absence of induction by leptin of melanocyte-stimulating
hormone (MSH) secretion in the hypothalamus; the MSH normally then binds
to melanocortin-4 receptor-expressing neurons and inhibits food intake.
Forbes et al. (2001) showed that leptin administered to leptin-deficient
(ob/ob) mice results in a large increase in peripheral MSH levels;
further, peripheral administration of an MSH analog results in a
reversal of their abnormally low metabolic rate, in an acceleration of
weight loss during a fast, in partial restoration of thermoregulation in
a cold challenge, and in inducing serum free fatty acid levels. These
results supported an important peripheral role for MSH in the
integration of metabolism with appetite in response to perceived fat
stores indicated by leptin levels.

Most endocrine hormones are produced in tissue and organs with permeable
microvessels that provide an excess of hormones to be transported by the
blood circulation to the distal target organ. Cao et al. (2001)
investigated whether leptin induces the formation of vascular
fenestrations and permeability, and characterized its angiogenic
property in the presence of other angiogenic factors. From studies in
mice, they provided evidence that leptin-induced new blood vessels are
fenestrated. Under physiologic conditions, capillary fenestrations were
found in the leptin-producing adipose tissue in lean mice. In contrast,
no vascular fenestrations were detected in the adipose tissue of
leptin-deficient ob/ob mice. Thus, leptin plays a critical role in the
maintenance and regulation of vascular fenestrations in the adipose
tissue. Leptin induces a rapid vascular permeability response when
administered intradermally. Further, leptin synergistically stimulated
angiogenesis with fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2; 134920) and vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF; 192240), the 2 most potent and commonly
expressed angiogenic factors. The findings demonstrated another function
of leptin: to increase vascular permeability.

Yuan et al. (2001) demonstrated that high doses of salicylates reverse
hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and dyslipidemia in obese rodents by
sensitizing insulin signaling. Activation or overexpression of IKBKB
(603258) attenuated insulin signaling in cultured cells, whereas IKKB
inhibition reversed insulin resistance. Thus, Yuan et al. (2001)
concluded that IKKB, rather than the cyclooxygenases (see 600262),
appears to be the relevant molecular target. Heterozygous deletion (IKKB
+/-) protected against the development of insulin resistance during
high-fat feeding and in obese Lep (ob/ob) mice. Yuan et al. (2001)
concluded that their findings implicate an inflammatory process in the
pathogenesis of insulin resistance in obesity and type II diabetes
mellitus (125853) and identified the IKKB pathway as a target for
insulin sensitization.

Hasty et al. (2001) generated mice deficient in both the low density
lipoprotein receptor (LDLR; 606945) and leptin (ob/ob). These doubly
mutant mice exhibited striking elevations in both total plasma
cholesterol and triglyceride levels and had extensive atherosclerotic
lesions throughout the aorta by 6 months of age. Although fasting, diet
restriction, and low-level leptin treatment significantly lowered total
plasma triglyceride levels, they caused only slight changes in total
plasma cholesterol levels. Hepatic cholesterol and triglyceride contents
as well as mRNA levels of cholesterologenic and lipogenic enzymes
suggested that leptin deficiency increased production of hepatic
triglycerides, but not cholesterol, in the ob/ob mice regardless of
their Ldlr genotype. These data provided evidence that the
hypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesterolemia in the doubly mutant mice
were caused by distinct mechanisms, suggesting that leptin might have
some impact on plasma cholesterol metabolism, possibly through an
LDLR-independent pathway.

Mancuso et al. (2002) showed that Lep-deficient mice had increased
susceptibility to intratracheal infection with Klebsiella pneumoniae
associated with reduced bacterial clearance and alveolar macrophage
phagocytosis in vitro. Wildtype mice, on the other hand, responded with
increased leptin levels in serum, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and
whole lung homogenates. Both mutant and normal mice synthesized TNF,
IL12 (see 161561), and MIP2 (GRO2; 139110), but the Lep-deficient mice
had reduced leukotriene (see LTB4R; 601531) synthesis. Exogenous
addition of leptin reversed both the alveolar macrophage and leukotriene
synthesis defects in vitro. Mancuso et al. (2002) noted that humans who
are most susceptible to bacterial pneumonia exhibit altered leptin
secretion or responsiveness as well as reduced leukotriene synthesis.

Xia et al. (2002) developed C3 (120700) and leptin double knockout mice.
Several metabolic measures were improved in comparison to ob/ob mice
although they were not returned to normal.

Sanna et al. (2003) found that the expression of serum leptin increased
before the clinical onset of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis
(EAE) in disease susceptible C57BL/6J (H-2b) and SJL/J (H-2s) mice. The
increase in serum leptin correlated with disease susceptibility,
reduction in food intake, and decrease in body weight. Acute starvation,
which prevented the increase in serum leptin, delayed disease onset and
attenuated clinical symptoms by inducing a Th2 cytokine switch. In situ
production of leptin in inflammatory infiltrates and in neurons occurred
only during the acute/active phase of chronic-progressive and
relapsing-remitting EAE. The secretion of leptin by activated T cells
was maintained by an autocrine loop as demonstrated by the in vitro
inhibition of the proliferative response of autoreactive T cells by
antileptin receptor antibodies.

To investigate the direct contribution of leptin deficiency to cardiac
hypertrophy in obesity and separate it from that caused by the
mechanical effects of obesity, Barouch et al. (2003) induced weight loss
in ob/ob mice by either leptin infusion or caloric restriction. Mice in
both groups lost similar weight compared with placebo-treated controls.
Leptin infusion completely reversed the increase in left ventricular
wall thickness with partial resolution of myocyte hypertrophy, whereas
calorie-restricted mice had no decrease in wall thickness and a lesser
change in myocyte size. Barouch et al. (2003) concluded that the effect
of leptin on left ventricular remodeling is not attributable to weight
loss alone and that leptin has antihypertrophic effects on the heart,
either directly or through a leptin-regulated neurohormonal pathway.

Using in situ peroxidase and immunofluorescence staining in mouse
hearts, Raju et al. (2006) localized Cntf receptors (CNTFR; 118946) to
the sarcolemma and confirmed the localization by immunoblot on isolated
myocytes. Subcutaneous administration of recombinant CNTF (118945) in
ob/ob and db/db mice resulted in significant reductions in cardiac
hypertrophy. Western blotting showed that both leptin and CNTF activated
STAT3 and ERK1 (MAPK3; 601795)/ERK2 (MAPK1; 176948) pathways in cultured
adult mouse cardiomyocytes and cardiac tissue from ob/ob and db/db mice.
Raju et al. (2006) concluded that CNTF plays a role in a cardiac signal
transduction pathway that regulates obesity-related left ventricular
hypertrophy.

Using a SREBP1 (184756)-deficient mouse model of lipodystrophy, Asilmaz
et al. (2004) found that low-dose central intracerebroventricular
administration of leptin corrected hepatic steatosis by repressing liver
Scd1. Central leptin also corrected insulin resistance by improving
insulin signal transduction in the liver, a response that was
Scd1-independent. Although subcutaneous leptin administration also
improved hyperglycemia and insulin resistance, it did not improve
hepatic steatosis.

Balthasar et al. (2004) generated mice with conditional deletion of
leptin receptors (601007) on proopiomelanocortin (POMC; 176830) neurons
and observed mild obesity, hyperleptinemia, and altered expression of
hypothalamic neuropeptides. Because the body weight increase was only
18% of that seen in mice with complete deficiency of leptin receptors,
the authors concluded that leptin receptors on POMC neurons are required
but not solely responsible for leptin's regulation of body weight
homeostasis.

Gao et al. (2007) administered estradiol (E2) to wildtype mice and rats
and observed a robust increase in the number of excitatory inputs to
POMC neurons in the arcuate nucleus. The rearrangement of synapses was
leptin independent, as it was also observed in leptin-deficient (ob/ob)
and leptin receptor-deficient (db/db) mice, and was paralleled by
decreased food intake and body weight gain, as well as increased energy
expenditure. Chronic E2 administration in a brain-specific Stat3
(102582)-knockout mouse model, a phenotype that closely resembles that
of ob/ob and db/db mice, had no effect on body weight, demonstrating
that the estrogen-induced decrease in body weight was dependent on Stat3
activation in the brain. Gao et al. (2007) concluded that synaptic
plasticity of arcuate nucleus feeding circuits is an inherent element in
body weight regulation.

In Koletsky fa(k)/fa(k) (LEPR-null) rats, Morton et al. (2005) observed
markedly increased meal size and reduced satiety in response to
cholecystokinin (CCK; 118440), suggesting a role for leptin signaling in
the response to endogenous signals that promote meal termination.
Restoration of LEPR in the area of the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus of
fa(k)/fa(k) rats by adenoviral gene therapy normalized the effect of CCK
on the activation of neurons in key hindbrain areas for processing
satiety signals and also reduced meal size and enhanced CCK-induced
satiety. Morton et al. (2005) concluded that forebrain signaling by
leptin limits food intake on a meal-to-meal basis by regulating the
hindbrain response to short-acting satiety signals.

Montez et al. (2005) treated wildtype mice with high-dose leptin until
fat mass was depleted, thus reducing endogenous leptin production; then
exogenous leptin was abruptly withdrawn, thereby inducing a state of
leptin deficiency in otherwise normal mice. The biologic response to
leptin deficiency so induced included altered neuropeptide levels,
decreased energy expenditure, and impaired reproductive and immune
function. Replacement of leptin at physiologic concentrations after
withdrawal of high-dose leptin blunted, but did not completely block,
the hyperphagia and weight regain caused by acute leptin deficiency, nor
did it correct the resulting reproductive and immune dysfunction. Montez
et al. (2005) suggested that high-dose leptin treatment induces a state
of partial leptin resistance, and concluded that these studies
established the role of acute hypoleptinemia in regulating energy
balance, the immune system, and reproductive function.

In rats exposed to chronic stress, Lu et al. (2006) detected low levels
of plasma leptin; systemic leptin treatment reversed the depression-like
phenotype and was accompanied by increased activity in the hippocampus.
Intrahippocampal administration of leptin produced an antidepressant
effect similar to that of systemic delivery, whereas infusion into the
hypothalamus decreased body weight but had no effect on the
depression-like phenotype. Lu et al. (2006) suggested that impaired
leptin production and secretion may contribute to chronic stress-induced
depression-like phenotypes, and that the hippocampus is a brain site
mediating leptin's antidepressant-like activity.

In studies in rodents, Kitamura et al. (2006) demonstrated that Foxo1a
(136533) and Stat3 exerted opposing actions on the expression of Agrp
(602311) and Pomc through transcriptional interference, with Foxo1a
promoting activation of Agrp and inhibition of Pomc. Kitamura et al.
(2006) concluded that Foxo1a mediates the Agrp-dependent effects of
leptin on food intake.

In studies in rats, Gao et al. (2007) observed that
intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of leptin inhibited AMPK while
concomitantly activating acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC; see ACACA, 200350)
in the arcuate and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus. In the
arcuate nucleus, overexpression of constitutively active AMPK prevented
arcuate ACC activation in response to ICV leptin, and inhibiting
hypothalamic ACC with 5-tetradecyloxy-2-furoic acid (TOFA) blocked
leptin-mediated decreases in food intake, body weight, and mRNA level of
the orexigenic neuropeptide NPY (162640), demonstrating that
hypothalamic ACC makes an important contribution to leptin's anorectic
effects. ICV leptin also upregulated arcuate nucleus levels of
malonyl-CoA and periventricular nucleus levels of palmitoyl-CoA; the
increase in both was blocked by TOFA, which also blocked leptin-mediated
hypophagia. Gao et al. (2007) suggested that while malonyl-CoA is a
downstream mediator of ACC in the leptin signaling pathway in the
arcuate nucleus, palmitoyl-CoA might be an effector in relaying ACC
signaling in the periventricular nucleus, thus highlighting
site-specific impacts of hypothalamic ACC activation in the leptin
anorectic signaling cascade.

Ren et al. (2007) generated Sh2b1 (608937)-knockout mice that developed
hyperlipidemia, leptin resistance, hyperphagia, obesity, hyperglycemia,
insulin resistance, and glucose intolerance. Neuron-specific restoration
of Sh2b1 corrected the metabolic disorders in the knockout mice and
improved leptin signaling and leptin regulation of orexigenic
neuropeptide expression in the hypothalamus. Neuron-specific
overexpression of Sh2b1 dose-dependently protected against high fat
diet-induced leptin resistance and obesity. Ren et al. (2007) suggested
that neuronal SH2B1 regulates energy balance, body weight, peripheral
insulin sensitivity, and glucose homeostasis at least in part by
enhancing hypothalamic leptin sensitivity.

Rahmouni et al. (2008) studied Bbs2 (606151) -/-, Bbs4 (600374) -/-, and
Bbs6 (604896) -/- mice and found that obesity was associated with
hyperleptinemia and resistance to the anorectic and weight-reducing
effects of leptin. Although all 3 of the BBS mouse models were similarly
resistant to the metabolic actions of leptin, only Bbs4 -/- and Bbs6 -/-
mice remained responsive to the effects of leptin on renal sympathetic
nerve activity and arterial pressure and developed hypertension. The
authors also found that BBS mice had decreased hypothalamic expression
of proopiomelanocortin and suggested that BBS genes play an important
role in maintaining leptin sensitivity in POMC neurons.

Lim et al. (2009) found that leptin contributed to pain behaviors in a
rat model of neuropathic pain induced by chronic constriction sciatic
nerve injury. Spinal administration of a leptin antagonist prevented and
reversed neuropathic pain behaviors. Further examination revealed that
levels of both leptin and the long form of the leptin receptor (601007)
were substantially increased within the ipsilateral spinal cord dorsal
horn after peripheral nerve injury. Mechanistic studies showed that
leptin upregulated the expression of both the spinal NMDA receptor
(GRIN1; 138249) and IL1-beta (147720) through the JAK/STAT pathway.
Furthermore, these pain-induced behavioral and cellular responses were
diminished in leptin-deficient mice and mimicked by spinal
administration of exogenous leptin in naive rats. The findings revealed
a critical role for spinal leptin in the pathogenesis of neuropathic
pain.

Sennello et al. (2008) found that dosing of IL12 (161560) and IL18
(600953) induced severe acute pancreatitis in obese (ob/ob) mice, but
not in nonobese leptin-deficient mice or wildtype mice. Mutant ob/ob
mice showed disruption of pancreatic exocrine tissue and acinar cell
death and increased serum amylase and lipase, characteristic of
necrotizing acute pancreatitis. They also showed adipose tissue necrosis
and saponification, severe hypocalcemia, and an elevated acute-phase
response. Wildtype mice treated with IL12 and IL18 developed nonlethal
edematous acute pancreatitis without the other abnormalities. Short-term
leptin reconstitution in the absence of major weight loss did not
protect ob/ob mice from cytokine-induced pancreatitis, but leptin
deficiency in the absence of obesity resulted in a significant reduction
in the severity of the pancreatitis. Sennello et al. (2008) concluded
that this model of acute pancreatitis indicated that obesity itself, not
leptin deficiency, is associated with increased severity of acute
pancreatitis.

Claycombe et al. (2008) compared hematopoietic processes in ob/ob mice
and C57BL/6 lean wildtype controls and found that despite their large
size and consumption of substantial amounts of nutrients, ob/ob mice had
only 60% as many nucleated cells in their marrow as controls. The B cell
compartment was the most affected, with 70% fewer cells, reducing the
absolute number of pre-B and immature B cells to 21% and 12% of normal,
respectively. While the proportion of myeloid cells remained nearly
normal in the obese mice, there was a reduction of 40% and 25%,
respectively, in absolute numbers of granulocytes and monocytes. Seven
days of provision of recombinant leptin promoted substantial
lymphopoiesis, increasing the number of B cells in the marrow of the
obese mice 2-fold, while doubling pre-B and tripling immature B cells;
at 12 days of supplementation, these subpopulations were at near-normal
levels. Leptin treatment also facilitated myelopoiesis such that the
marrow of the obese mice contained normal numbers of monocytes and
granulocytes after 7 days. Claycombe et al. (2008) suggested that leptin
plays an essential role in sustaining lymphopoiesis and myelopoiesis in
the marrow.

Czupryn et al. (2011) generated physically chimeric hypothalami by
microtransplanting small numbers of embryonic enhanced green fluorescent
protein-expressing leptin-responsive hypothalamic cells into hypothalami
of postnatal lepin receptor-deficient (db/db) mice, which develop morbid
obesity. Donor neurons differentiated and integrated as 4 distinct
hypothalamic neuron subtypes, formed functional excitatory and
inhibitory synapses, partially restored leptin responsiveness, and
ameliorated hyperglycemia and obesity in db/db mice. Czupryn et al.
(2011) concluded that their experiments served as a proof of concept
that transplanted neurons can functionally reconstitute complex neuronal
circuitry in the mammalian brain.

NOMENCLATURE

Leptin (from the Greek for 'thin') was the name proposed by Halaas et
al. (1995) for the fat-regulating hormone. LEP is the preferred gene
symbol.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
LEPTIN DEFICIENCY
LEP, 1-BP DEL, FS147TER

In 2 morbidly obese cousins with very low serum leptin levels (614962)
from an inbred Pakistani kindred, Montague et al. (1997) found
homozygosity for a deletion of a guanine nucleotide in the leptin gene:
there were 5 rather than the expected 6 guanine nucleotides present
between nucleotides 393 and 398. The mutation disrupted the reading
frame of the leptin gene, leading to the introduction of 14 aberrant
amino acids after gly132 in the leptin polypeptide, followed by a
premature stop codon.

Farooqi et al. (2002) described a third child from a consanguineous
family of Pakistani origin living in the United Kingdom homozygous for
the guanine deletion in codon 133 of leptin (delta-G133). The family was
not known to be related to the family identified by Montague et al.
(1997) over at least 5 generations. Leptin deficiency was associated
with reduced numbers of circulating CD4+ T cells and impaired T cell
proliferation and cytokine release, all of which were reversed by
recombinant human leptin administration.

In a child of consanguineous Pakistani parents in Canada who presented
with severe hyperphagia and obesity, Gibson et al. (2004) found
homozygosity for the delta-133G mutation in leptin. The family
originated from the same area of Pakistan as the 2 United Kingdom
families reported by Montague et al. (1997) and Farooqi et al. (2002),
but was not known to be related over 4 generations.

LEPTIN DEFICIENCY
LEP, ARG105TRP

In a Turkish patient with a body mass index (BMI) of 55.8 kg/m(2) and
very low serum leptin concentrations (614962), Strobel et al. (1998)
found a C-to-T transition in the LEP gene which resulted in an
arg105-to-trp amino acid replacement in the mature protein. The C-to-T
substitution abolished an MspI restriction site, allowing rapid PCR
screening for the mutation in members of the patient's family. Two other
individuals were homozygous for the mutation, were markedly obese, and
had low levels of serum leptin in relation to their elevated BMI. All 3
homozygotes were markedly hyperphagic. Plasma insulin concentrations
were elevated, and 1 of the 3 was hyperglycemic. All other members of
this highly consanguineous kindred were either heterozygous for the
mutation or homozygous for the wildtype allele and had normal body
weight, serum leptin levels, fasting blood glucose, and plasma insulin
levels, indicating a recessive mutation responsible for monogenic
obesity.

Licinio et al. (2004) reported the results of leptin replacement in 3
morbidly obese members of the Turkish kindred previously reported by
Strobel et al. (1998). They referred to the mutation in these patients
as CYS105THR. Patients were hypogonadal, and 1 of them also had type II
diabetes (125853). After 18 months of treatment with doses of leptin
chosen to achieve normal leptin concentrations, the patients
demonstrated profound weight loss, increased physical activity, changes
in endocrine function and metabolism (including resolution of type II
diabetes mellitus and hypogonadism), and beneficial effects on ingestive
and noningestive behavior.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CD99 is a 32-kD T-cell surface glycoprotein involved in spontaneous
rosette formation with erythrocytes (Bernard et al., 1988). The gene
encoding CD99 (MIC2X) is located in the pseudoautosomal region (PAR) at
the end of the short arm of the X and Y chromosomes (Goodfellow et al.,
1983). See also MIC2Y (450000).

CLONING

The monoclonal antibody 12E7 was raised against human leukemia T cells.
It detects a 30,000 MW protein which is expressed on all human tissues
tested with the possible exception of spermatozoa (Levy et al., 1979).

Dracopoli et al. (1985) described a monoclonal antibody, O13, that
defines a cell surface antigen that is expressed on most cultured human
cells but not on rodent cells. Glycoproteins of 25,000 and 30,000 MW
were precipitated by O13. Either the X or the Y chromosome in cultured
hybrid cells was sufficient for serologic reactivity with the antiserum.
The gene encoding O13 maps to Xp22-pter and apparently escapes
lyonization. All of these characteristics suggested that O13 was related
or identical to 12E7 and that MSK5X and MSK57 (so-called because the
workers were at Sloan-Kettering) were related or identical to MIC2X and
MIC2Y.

Darling et al. (1986) cloned the MIC2X and MIC2Y genes and concluded
that their sequences are closely related or identical.

Gelin et al. (1989) isolated a 1.11-kb cDNA from a lambda-gt11
expression library by screening with monoclonal antibodies directed
against E2 antigen. The primary structure of E2, deduced from the
nucleotide sequence of its gene, comprises 185 amino acids and is devoid
of N-linked glycosylation sites. The protein displays an organization
typical of an integral membrane protein. Nucleotide sequencing revealed
that E2 is the MIC2 gene product.

MAPPING

Goodfellow et al. (1983) showed that the gene for the E2 antigen, called
MIC2 (M = monoclonal; IC = Imperial Cancer Research Fund; 2 = order of
discovery), maps to the band between Xp22.3 and Xpter, where the STS
(300747) and Xg (300879) genes are located. Goodfellow et al. (1984)
showed that the MIC2X locus, like Xg and STS, escapes lyonization. They
identified a homologous locus on the Y chromosome (MIC2Y; 45000) in the
euchromatin region Ypter-q11.1. This was the first instance of a clear
Y-linked structural gene.

Curry et al. (1984) found that the STS, Xg, and MIC2X loci as well as
the locus for X-linked chondrodysplasia punctata (302950) were
apparently absent in males with deletion of Xp22.32.

By in situ hybridization, Buckle et al. (1985) showed that MIC2Y is
located on the distal part of Yp, namely, Ypter-p11.2.

On the basis of an X/Y translocation in which STS activity was retained
with the X chromosome (selected by fusion with an HPRT-deficient mouse
cell line) but MIC2X was lost, Geller et al. (1986) concluded that MIC2X
is distal to STS.

- Pseudogene

Mangs and Morris (2007) stated that the sequence identified by Smith and
Goodfellow (1994) as MIC2R (CD99L1) is a pseudogene that shares 78%
sequence homology with MIC2 (CD99). Smith and Goodfellow (1994) had
detected sequences related to exons 1, 4, and 5 of MIC2 on the X and Y
chromosomes of humans and other primate species. Isolation of these
sequences defined the MIC2R (MIC2-related) locus, which is associated
with the second-most proximal CpG-rich island in the human
pseudoautosomal region. Genomic sequences from the MIC2R locus showed
that it is composed of a single sequence related to exon 1 and at least
4 tandem copies of sequences related to exons 4 and 5 of MIC2.
Comparison of the 4 sequences related to exons 4 and 5 suggested that
they are the result of sequential duplication of a 2.8-kb region during
evolution. Smith and Goodfellow (1994) detected transcripts from the
MIC2R locus in at least 10 adult and fetal tissues, and a number of
different transcripts appear to be generated by alternative RNA
splicing. Since none of the transcripts they analyzed contained a
significant open reading frame, the function of the MIC2R locus remained
unknown.

GENE FUNCTION

Gelin et al. (1989) found that Xg(a-) females (see 314700) have no E2
molecule on the surface of their red cells, in contrast with Xg(a+)
individuals, but have the molecule in their cytoplasm, in the form of
the 28-kD precursor. Thus, the MIC2 gene encodes a cell surface molecule
involved in T-cell adhesion processes.

Kovar et al. (1990) noted that Ewing sarcoma and other PNE tumors
express high amounts of a glycoprotein on their cell surface, which
could be specifically detected by the monoclonal antibody HBA-71. They
identified this glycoprotein as the product of the pseudoautosomal gene
CD99. Kovar et al. (1990) presented evidence that CD99 is expressed at
low levels in most, if not all, human cells and normal tissues. Because
expression of CD99 is significantly enhanced in ES and PNET cells, they
suggested that detection of the antigen by immunocytochemical analysis
might be a useful tool in tumor diagnosis. Khoury (2005) stated that
strong diffuse CD99 immunostaining constitutes a useful positive marker
for the Ewing sarcoma family of tumors.

Goodfellow et al. (1987) presented evidence suggesting the existence of
a pseudoautosomal locus, XGR (314705), that regulates expression of MIC2
and XG.

Using flow cytometry and Western and Northern blot analyses, Fouchet et
al. (2000) provided a quantitative estimation of XG and CD99 on human
erythrocytes. Their findings supported the hypothesis of genetic control
of XG and CD99 expression by the hypothetical XGR locus.

Fouchet et al. (2000) examined coexpression of human XG and CD99 cDNAs
in transfected mouse cells, either in double transfectants or in somatic
hybrids from single transfectants. Their findings were consistent with
transcriptional coregulation of XG and CD99 expression, because no
influence of either protein on the surface production of the other was
observed. In addition, Fouchet et al. (2000) found no evidence of
association or complex formation between XG and CD99 on transfected
mouse cells or human erythrocytes.

Using flow cytometric analysis, Pettersen et al. (2001) demonstrated
that activation of a distinct domain of CD99 activates a
caspase-independent death pathway in T cells. Ligation of FAS (TNFRSF6;
134637) and TRAIL (TNFSF10; 603598) death receptors was less effective
than CD99 ligation in controlling transformed T cells.

Bixel et al. (2010) found that antibodies against mouse Cd99 or Pecam1
(173445) trapped neutrophils between endothelial cells in vitro. In
contrast, electron and 3-dimensional confocal microscopy of inflamed
cremaster demonstrated that antibodies against Cd99 or Cd99l2 (300846)
or Pecam1 gene deletion led to accumulation of neutrophils in vivo
between endothelial cells and basement membrane rather than between
endothelial cells. Antibodies against Cd99 or Cd99l2 in combination with
Pecam1 deficiency resulted in additive inhibitory effects on leukocyte
extravasation in 2 different inflammation models. Bixel et al. (2010)
concluded that CD99 and CD99L2 act independently of PECAM1 but at the
same site during diapedesis, i.e., between endothelial cells and the
basement membrane.

HISTORY

Polymorphism at the Xg locus and the Yg locus shows similar allele
frequencies. This could be due to chance, to selection, or to
recombination between the X and Y chromosomes (Burgoyne, 1982).

Tippett et al. (1986) presented family and sibship analysis to prove
that the 12E7 quantitative polymorphism of red cells is controlled by
the Y-borne locus, Yg, in addition to the X-borne locus, Xg. X-Y
recombination was invoked to explain the apparent exception to Y-borne
control in 1 family.

Goodfellow et al. (1986) stated that MIC2 recombines with TDF
(testis-determining factor) at a frequency of 2 to 3%. MIC2 was the most
proximal autosomal locus described to that time and a useful marker in
studies directed toward isolation of TDF. The order of Y-specific
sequences located proximal to the sex-determining gene(s), and therefore
not pseudoautosomal, has been determined on the basis of their presence
or absence in DNA from XX males, and the order of pseudoautosomal loci
situated distal to TDF has been established through family studies such
as those presented by Goodfellow et al. (1986).

During meiosis, pairing of the X and Y begins at the ends of the short
arms. Cooke et al. (1985) found sequence homology in the pairing regions
of the human X and Y. Because of a high order of polymorphism, they
could do family studies which showed what they termed 'pseudoautosomal'
inheritance, whereas Cooke et al. (1985) used repetitive sequences for
this demonstration. Simmler et al. (1985) used a single-copy genomic DNA
fragment which occurred in different allelic forms shared by both sex
chromosomes. Homologous segments of the X and Y have been suspected
because the 2 have a common ancestral origin; there is karyologic
evidence for pairing and crossing-over and, in man, the Turner phenotype
suggests deficiency of genetic material located on the second sex
chromosome.

150000	TITLE *150000 LACTATE DEHYDROGENASE A; LDHA
;;LDH, SUBUNIT M
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The LDHA gene encodes the A subunit of lactate dehydrogenase (EC
1.1.1.27), an enzyme that catalyzes the interconversion of lactate and
pyruvate. The A subunit is expressed in skeletal muscle. Other isoforms
include LDHB (150100), expressed in cardiac muscle, and LDHC (150150),
expressed in testes (Tsujibo et al., 1985; Chung et al., 1985).

CLONING

Tsujibo et al. (1985) isolated cDNA clones corresponding to the human
LDHA gene from a human fibroblast cDNA library. The predicted 332-amino
acid sequence had a molecular mass of 36.7 kD and showed 92% homology to
the porcine Ldha polypeptide. A nonfunctional pseudogene was also
isolated.

GENE STRUCTURE

Chung et al. (1985) determined that the LDHA gene contains 7 exons and
spans about 12 kb.

MAPPING

Studies using human-mouse somatic cell hybrids indicated that the LDHA
and LDHB loci are not linked (Nabholz et al., 1969). By study of cell
hybrids, LDHA was assigned to the short arm of chromosome 11 by Francke
and Busby (1975).

By the study of cells from 4 persons with different interstitial
deletions of 11p, Francke et al. (1977) assigned the LDHA locus to
11p1203-11p1208. At HGM8, controversy arose over the mapping of LDHA
(see Grzeschik and Kazazian, 1985). HGM8 reported the location as
11p14-p12. Lebo et al. (1985) and Lewis et al. (1985) placed the locus
at a more distal position.

Yang-Feng et al. (1986) did in situ hybridization studies in cell lines
from 2 persons with apparently balanced translocations involving 11p13.
Their findings excluded LDHA from any region proximal to 11p13 and
localized the gene to 11p15-p14.

Scrable et al. (1990) demonstrated that LDHA is located in band 11p15.4.

GENE FUNCTION

Centrosomal proteins (e.g., 117139, 117140, 117141, 117143) have been
studied mainly with anticentrosome serum. Using a spontaneously arising
rabbit anticentrosome serum with strong human specificity, Gosti et al.
(1987) identified specific antigens in isolated centrosomes which
reacted with several noncentrosomal proteins, notably, lactate
dehydrogenase.

Anderson and Kovacik (1981) identified an unusual isozyme of lactate
dehydrogenase, which they designated lactate dehydrogenase K (LDHK), in
cells transformed by the Kirsten murine sarcoma virus. They examined 16
different human carcinomas and found that 11 had LDHK activity 10- to
500-fold over the level in adjoining nontumor tissue. Li et al. (1988)
determined that this cancer-associated lactate dehydrogenase is a
tyrosylphosphorylated form of LDHA. The protein was found to be
complexed with 21-kD, 30-kD, and 56-kD proteins.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Nance et al. (1963) observed a genetically determined variant LDH in the
red cells of 4 members of 2 generations of a Brazilian family. The
mutation involved the A subunit. This was the first instance in which
practical considerations permitted demonstration of the variant in
multiple relatives. Unlike the findings of Shaw and Barto (1963) in
Peromyscus and of Boyer et al. (1963) in man, the findings in the
Brazilian family did not suggest random association between the products
of the mutant and wildtype alleles.

LDH variants, involving either the A or the B subunit, seem to be
unusually frequent in India (Das et al., 1970).

- Glycogen Storage Disease XI

In a patient with LDHA deficiency, or glycogen storage disease XI
(GSD11; 612933), reported by Maekawa et al. (1986), Maekawa et al.
(1990) found homozygosity for a 20-bp deletion in exon 6 of the LDHA
gene (150000.0001). Maekawa et al. (1991) demonstrated the same mutation
in 18 persons from the 4 known affected families in Japan.

EVOLUTION

Markert et al. (1975) suggested that the ancestral vertebrate LDH was an
A4-like enzyme since lampreys have only the A4 isozyme. Sidell and
Beland (1980) presented evidence supporting this view: the hagfish has a
B4 enzyme but it diverges less from A4 enzyme than does the B4 of other
fishes and higher vertebrates. A close phylogenic relative of the
lamprey, the Atlantic hagfish lives under sustained hypoxic conditions
that may have favored evolution of a B4 enzyme. A4 is the muscle
isozyme, B4 is the heart isozyme, and C4 is the testicular isozyme.

Morizot (1984) collated linkage data from lower vertebrates and several
mammalian species. The lower vertebrates included poeciliid fishes
(Xiphophorus and Poeciliopsis), salmonid fishes (trout), and frogs
(Rana). He postulated a 12-locus ancestral synteny group consisting of
isocitrate dehydrogenase (on human 2 and 15), 3 LDH loci (on human 11
and 12), HEXA (on human 15), nucleoside phosphorylase (on human 14),
pyruvate kinase (on human 15), MPI (on human 15), PEPB (on human 12),
citrate synthase (on human 12), TPI (on human 12), and
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (on human 12). If the 3 LDH
loci are part of the primordial synteny group, LDH genes may have
originated by intrachromosomal duplication rather than by
polyploidization as has been thought.

ANIMAL MODEL

In trout, the loci coding for LDH subunits A and B are linked (Morrison
and Wright, 1966). In the mouse, Chang et al. (1979) found that the A
and B subunits are more similar to each other in amino acid sequence
than to the C subunit.

In the mouse, Merkle et al. (1992) found that homozygosity for absent
LDHA subunit led to early postimplantation death. Merkle et al. (1992)
suggested that the fact that human subjects with a complete absence of
LDHA subunits are fully viable may be due to the fact that, in contrast
with the situation in the mouse, LDHB predominates in the human fetus.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE XI
LDHA, 20-BP DEL, EX6

In a patient with lactate dehydrogenase A deficiency, or glycogen
storage disease XI (612933), reported by Maekawa et al. (1986), Maekawa
et al. (1990) found a 20-bp deletion in exon 6 of the LDHA gene,
resulting in a frameshift, premature termination, and complete lack of
the alpha subunits of LDH. The predicted incomplete LDHA subunit
contained only 259 instead of 331 amino acids and appeared to be
degraded rapidly, since no protein was detected immunologically. Maekawa
et al. (1990) stated that 'this female patient with the LDHA deficiency
frequently complained of uterine stiffness during her pregnancy. Uterine
stiffness was a problem in the early stage of delivery and, thus, she
required a Caesarean section.'

In a fragment of the LDHA gene amplified by PCR using 2 primers specific
for the gene, Maekawa et al. (1991) demonstrated the same mutation in 18
persons from the 4 known affected families in Japan.

Miyajima et al. (1993) identified the exon 6 deletion in 2 adult
Japanese sisters that had muscle stiffness following strenuous exercise
since the teens and age 9, respectively. Both had had cesarean sections
because the 'uterus was too stiff in the early stage of delivery.'

.0002
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE XI
LDHA, GLU328TER

Maekawa et al. (1991) used the ratio of LDHB to LDHA subunits in
erythrocytes as a means of identifying individuals heterozygous for LDHA
deficiency (GSD11; 612933). In one such individual, they identified a
G-to-T transversion in the LDHA gene, resulting in a glu328-to-ter
(E328X) substitution. There were no manifestations in this heterozygous
subject; however, homozygotes would presumably be affected.

605455	TITLE *605455 RAS-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN RAB26; RAB26
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the RAB protein family, including RAB26, are important
regulators of vesicular fusion and trafficking. The RAB family of small
G proteins regulates intercellular vesicle trafficking, including
exocytosis, endocytosis, and recycling (summary by Seki et al., 2000).

CLONING

Seki et al. (2000) identified a new member of the RAB family of genes
through a search of a public database, and isolated its full-length cDNA
from a human fetal brain cDNA library. The deduced 190-amino acid
protein shares 87% sequence identity with rat RAB26. By RT-PCR, Seki et
al. (2000) demonstrated that RAB26 is predominantly expressed in adult
and fetal brain, with high expression in the amygdala, cerebellum,
caudate nucleus, and hippocampus.

GENE STRUCTURE

Seki et al. (2000) determined that the RAB26 gene contains 8 exons that
span about 44 kb of genomic DNA.

MAPPING

By PCR-based analysis of a human/rodent monoclonal hybrid cell panel and
by radiation hybrid analysis, Seki et al. (2000) mapped the RAB26 gene
to chromosome 16p13.3.

125264	TITLE *125264 DEK ONCOGENE; DEK
;;D6S231E
DEK/NUP214 FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using cDNA cloning of an aberrant 5.5-kb transcript found in a subset of
patients with acute myeloid leukemia (acute nonlymphocytic leukemia) who
carry a t(6;9)(p23;q34) translocation, von Lindern et al. (1992)
isolated a novel gene on chromosome 6 that they called DEK. The
breakpoints on chromosome 6 and those on chromosome 9 are clustered in a
specific intron of the DEK and CAN (NUP214; 114350) genes, respectively;
hence, the DEK/CAN fusion gene encodes an invariable transcript. The
5-prime part of the DEK gene is fused to the 3-prime part of the CAN
gene with no interruption of open reading frame. The authors stated that
comparisons with DNA databases showed no consistent homology with known
proteins at that time.

GENE FUNCTION

The product of the DEK oncogene is a 43-kD nuclear protein. Fu et al.
(1997) stated that, although first identified in a fusion with the CAN
nucleoporin protein in a specific subtype of acute myelogenous leukemia,
DEK has also been shown to be an autoantigen in patients with
pauciarticular onset juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. Furthermore, the
last 65 amino acids of DEK can partially reverse the mutation-prone
phenotype of cells from patients with ataxia-telangiectasia (208900). Fu
et al. (1997) identified DEK as the 43-kD factor that binds the 'pets'
site in the HIV-2 genome which is involved in the infectivity of HIV-2.
They demonstrated that DEK is a site-specific DNA binding protein that
is likely involved in transcriptional regulation and signal
transduction. Fu et al. (1997) stated that their discovery has
implications for multiple pathogenic processes, including hematologic
malignancies, arthritis, ataxia-telangiectasia, and AIDS caused by
HIV-2. HIV-2 is found in West Africa, and increasingly in other parts of
the world. They noted that, like HIV-1, HIV-2 can cause AIDS, but
typically the asymptomatic period following HIV-2 infection is much
longer than that following HIV-1 infection.

By agarose gel electrophoresis analysis of HeLa nuclear extracts,
Alexiadis et al. (2000) detected DEK-induced alterations of the
superhelical density of DNA in chromatin in the presence of
topoisomerase I (TOP1; 126420) or II (TOP2A; 126430). The change in
topology was not observed in naked DNA. SDS-PAGE analysis indicated that
DEK does not induce displacement of histones but that histone H2A/H2B
(see 142711) is required for the DEK-mediated change in nucleosomal DNA
topology. Agarose gel electrophoresis analysis showed that DEK reduces
the efficiency with which chromatin is replicated.

Pre-mRNA splicing involves the step-wise assembly of large RNA-protein
complexes, termed spliceosomes, that contain small nuclear
ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs) and many non-snRNP splicing
factors, many of which contain RS domains (i.e., alternating arg/ser
residues). Members of the SR protein family have N-terminal RNA
recognition motifs and a phosphorylated C-terminal RS domain. Using
splicing and immunoprecipitation assays, McGarvey et al. (2000)
identified DEK as one of the first components of the splicing complex
that remains associated with spliced exons dependent on prior splicing
of pre-mRNA. The association is mediated by specific interactions
involving SR proteins such as SRM160 (605975).

Using cell fractionation, immunolabeling, and micrococcal nuclease
digestion analysis, Kappes et al. (2001) determined that the majority of
DEK is associated with chromatin, both genetically active and inactive
forms, and oligonucleosomes, while only a small fraction is associated
with RNA. The amount and localization of DEK does not change during the
cell cycle. Kappes et al. (2001) concluded that DEK appears to have dual
RNA- and DNA-binding properties.

The 65- and 35-kD subunits of the splicing factor U2AF, U2AF65 (191318)
and U2AF35 (191317), recognize, respectively, the pyrimidine-rich tract
and the conserved terminal AG present at metazoan 3-prime splice sites.
Soares et al. (2006) reported that DEK, a chromatin- and RNA-associated
protein mutated or overexpressed in certain cancers, enforces 3-prime
splice site discrimination by U2AF. DEK phosphorylated at serines 19 and
32 associates with U2AF35, facilitates the U2AF35-AG interaction, and
prevents binding of U2AF65 to pyrimidine tracts not followed by AG. DEK
and its phosphorylation are required for intron removal, but not for
splicing complex assembly, which indicates that proofreading of early
3-prime splice site recognition influences catalytic activation of the
spliceosome.

Cheung et al. (2012) found that Dek expression was upregulated in mouse
muscle satellite cells following damage-induced satellite cell
activation. Dek was specifically upregulated in daughter cells destined
for proliferation as a progenitor, but it was not expressed in daughter
cells destined for self-renewal. Cheung et al. (2012) found that
microRNA-489 (MIR489; 614523) was highly expressed in quiescent mouse
muscle satellite cells and was quickly downregulated during
injury-induced satellite cell activation. Bioinformatic analysis
revealed a Mir489 target sequence in the Dek 3-prime UTR, and Dek
protein expression was reduced following transfection with Mir489.
Expression of Mir489 or knockdown of Dek reduced satellite cell
proliferation.

MAPPING

The DEK gene resides on chromosome 6p23 (von Lindern et al., 1992).
