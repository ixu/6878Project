606909	TITLE *606909 VESICLE-ASSOCIATED MEMBRANE PROTEIN 4; VAMP4
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

VAMP4 is a member of the vesicle-associated membrane protein family of
trafficking proteins.

CLONING

Advani et al. (1998) used an EST identified through a database search to
obtain a corresponding human VAMP4 germinal center B-cell clone. The
predicted 141-amino acid protein contains an amphipathic helix that may
participate in coiled-coil interactions and a C-terminal hydrophobic
domain predicted to serve as a membrane anchor. Northern blot analysis
detected transcripts of 1.4, 2.4, and 5.6 kb that are broadly expressed
and abundant in heart. Transfection into normal rat kidney cells
resulted in a punctate juxtanuclear staining pattern that partially
overlaps with syntaxin-6 (STX6; 603944), a marker for the trans-Golgi
network. By Western blot analysis, Steegmaier et al. (1999) identified a
single 18-kD protein expressed in all rat tissues examined except
skeletal muscle, with highest expression in brain and testis. They also
found expression in all mammalian cell lines tested. By
immunoprecipitation of rat brain detergent extracts, Steegmaier et al.
(1999) found that VAMP4 exists in a complex with syntaxin-6.

GENE FUNCTION

Steegmaier et al. (1999) suggested that VAMP4 plays a role in
trans-Golgi network-to-endosome transport.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the VAMP4
gene to chromosome 1 (TMAP stSG54007). Scott (2002) mapped VAMP4 to
1q24-q25 based on sequence similarity between VAMP4 (GenBank GENBANK
AF044310) and a BAC (GenBank GENBANK AL035296) mapped to this location.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Matsuoka et al. (1991, 1993) isolated a smooth muscle myosin heavy-chain
gene from a human cDNA library. They confirmed it as a smooth muscle MHC
gene by Northern blot hybridization and a partial DNA sequence analysis.

MAPPING

Deng et al. (1993) mapped the MYH11 gene to the middle of the short arm
of chromosome 16 by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Southern blots
of a panel of hybrids containing different portions of human chromosome
16 localized the gene to 16p13.13-p13.12. Studies of DNA from a
CHO/mouse hybrid clone mapping panel showed that the gene was located on
mouse chromosome 16.

GENE FUNCTION

- MYH11/CBFB FUSION GENE

The pericentric inversion inv(16)(p13q22) is a characteristic
abnormality associated with acute myeloid leukemia, most commonly of the
M4Eo subtype. Liu et al. (1993) pinpointed the 16p and 16q breakpoints
by yeast artificial chromosome and cosmid cloning and identified the 2
genes involved in the inversion. On 16p, the MYH11 gene was interrupted;
on 16q, the inversion occurred near the end of the coding region for
CBF-beta (121360), also known as PEBP2-beta, a subunit of a
heterodimeric transcription factor regulating genes expressed in T
cells. In all of 6 inv(16) patients tested, an in-frame fusion messenger
RNA was demonstrated that connected the first 165 amino acids of CBFB
with the tail region of MYH11. The repeated coiled coil of MYH11 may
result in dimerization of the CBFB fusion protein, which in turn would
lead to alterations in transcriptional regulation and contribute to
leukemic transformation.

Castilla et al. (1999) showed that the fusion Cbfb-MYH11 blocks myeloid
differentiation in mice and predisposes the mice to acute myelomonocytic
leukemia when exposed to N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU), a potent DNA
alkylating mutagen.

Huang et al. (2004), who referred to MYH11 as smooth muscle myosin heavy
chain (SMMHC), investigated the molecular basis for the dominant
inactivation of RUNX1 (151385) by the leukemogenic inversion of
chromosome 16. They showed that, in the PEBP2-beta-SMMHC chimeric
protein, the second heterodimerization domain is created by the fusion
junction, enabling the chimeric protein to interact with RUNX1 at far
greater affinity than PEBP2-beta and inactivate the RUNX1 function. To
explain how heterozygous chimeric protein can inactivate homozygous
RUNX1 near to completion, Huang et al. (2004) proposed a model for the
chimeric protein that consists of a Y-shaped dimer with unpaired
N-terminal halves followed by a coiled-coil for the C-terminal region.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Familial clustering of common (isolated) thoracic aortic aneurysm/aortic
dissection (TAAD), one of the most severe cardiovascular conditions in
adults, is heterogeneous, with 1 locus having been mapped to chromosome
16p13.1-p12.2 (AAT4; 132900). The MYH11 gene is located in the critical
linkage region for AAT4. Zhu et al. (2006) performed systematic mutation
screening, which showed 2 heterozygous mutations affecting the same
allele of MYH11 in the French kindred reported by Khau Van Kien et al.
(2004, 2005). The first was a substitution at the splice donor site of
intron 32 and the second was a missense mutation in exon 37, R1758Q
(160745.0001). Both mutations were identified in all subjects carrying
the disease haplotype, but neither was found in 340 normal chromosomes.
A similar mutation analysis in an American family with a combination of
thoracic aortic aneurysm and patent ductus arteriosus (Glancy et al.,
2001) showed a mutation in the MYH11 gene, a deletion of 72 nucleotides
within exon 28 (160745.0002). Zhu et al. (2006) suggested that the
position of the mutations observed in the French and American kindreds
may affect the coiled-coil structure of smooth muscle myosin heavy chain
(SM-MHC) and the assembly of myosin thick filaments. Abnormal
immunologic recognition of SM-MHC and the colocalization of wildtype and
mutant rod proteins in smooth muscle cells in conjunction with
differences in their coimmunoprecipitation capacities strongly suggested
a dominant-negative effect of the mutations.

The ascending aorta is placed under major mechanical stress during each
cardiac cycle. Khau Van Kien et al. (2005) showed in the French kindred
that individuals bearing the disease haplotype showed altered aortic
stiffness parameters: notably, aortic compliance, which serves as an
early marker of the disease. Zhu et al. (2006) extended this study to
49-first degree relatives, showing that aortic diameter was generally
similar in those with and without the mutation, but that the carriers of
the mutation had a lower aortic compliance (66% decrease) and a higher
pulse wave velocity (73% increase; both p less than 0.001). Young
asymptomatic mutation carriers already had aortic indices similar to
those of symptomatic mutation carriers and significantly different from
those of normal relatives of the same age. Thus, Zhu et al. (2006)
concluded that MYH11 heterozygous mutation leads to an early and severe
decrease in the elasticity of the aortic wall consistent with the role
of smooth muscle cells in maintaining the mechanical properties of the
thoracic aorta.

Alhopuro et al. (2008) identified somatic mutations in the MYH11 gene in
56 (56%) of 101 samples of colorectal cancer (114500) tissue showing
microsatellite instability. All mutations were within a mononucleotide
repeat of 8 cytosines (C8) in the last exon of the MYH11 SM2 isoform,
which is susceptible to mutations under microsatellite instability, and
were predicted to lead to a frameshift and elongation of the protein.
All mutations were found within epithelial cells. Analysis of
microsatellite stable tumors identified 2 somatic mutations in the same
tumor that were not in the C8 repeat. Functional expression studies of
the mutant proteins showed unregulated actin-activated motor activity.

Among 32 patients with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS; 175200) and 66
patients with unspecified hamartomatous polyposis, Alhopuro et al.
(2008) identified 1 PJS patient with a heterozygous germline 1-bp
insertion in the C8 repeat of the MYH11 gene. This mutation was also
identified in the somatic state in a colorectal tumor from an unrelated
patient, but not in 1,015 controls. The patient had a cystic astrocytoma
at age 13 years. At age 23 years, he developed intussusception and was
diagnosed with typical PJS. His unaffected father also carried the
mutation. There was no family history of the disorder, and the patient
did not have a STK11 (602216) mutation. Based on a zebrafish phenotype
(see ANIMAL MODEL), Alhopuro et al. (2008) postulated autosomal
recessive inheritance and the presence of a second unidentified MYH11
mutation.

Pannu et al. (2007) sequenced the MYH11 gene in 3 probands from 3 TAAD
families in which 1 or more members had patent ductus arteriosus (PDA)
and in 93 probands from unrelated TAAD families without PDA, and
identified 2 closely linked missense mutations in 1 of the 3 TAAD/PDA
families (160745.0003 and 160745.0004) and a different missense mutation
in another of the 3 TAAD/PDA families (160745.0005). Analysis of aortic
sections and explanted smooth muscle cells from mutation-positive
individuals from both families revealed upregulation of insulin-like
growth factor-1 (IGF1; 147440) but no increase in transforming growth
factor-beta (TGFB; 190180) or downstream targets. Enhanced expression
levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE; 106180) and markers of
angiotensin II (106150) vascular inflammation, e.g., macrophage
inflammatory proteins 1-alpha (MIP1A; 182283) and 1-beta (MIP1B;
182284), were also found.

ANIMAL MODEL

Major changes in the structure and composition of the ductus arteriosus
occur before and after delivery, and these changes require smooth muscle
cells to migrate, proliferate, differentiate, and contract (Slomp et
al., 1997). Homozygous MYH11 -/- mice deficient in SM-MHC have delay in
closure of the ductus arteriosus (Morano et al., 2000). The
SM-MHC-deficient mice also presented a giant thin-walled bladder and
abnormal intestinal movement. No symptoms of this type were observed in
the affected members with AAT4.

The autosomal recessive Zebrafish meltdown (mlt) lethal phenotype is
characterized by cystic expansion of the posterior intestine as a result
of stromal invasion of nontransformed epithelial cells. Using positional
cloning, Wallace et al. (2005) determined that the mlt phenotype
resulted from a mutation in the Myh11 gene that causes constitutive
activation of the Myh11 ATPase and disruption of smooth muscle cells
surrounding the posterior intestine. The findings implicated an
essential role for smooth muscle signaling in the maintenance of
epithelial architecture.

MYH11, IVS32, G-T, +1, ARG1758GLN

In the French 'Bourgogne' kindred described by Khau Van Kien et al.
(2004) with familial thoracic aortic aneurysm/dissection with patent
ductus arteriosus mapping to chromosome 16p12.2-p13.13 (AAT4; 132900),
Zhu et al. (2006) detected 2 heterozygous mutations affecting the same
allele of the MYH11 gene: a substitution at the splice donor site of
intron 32 (IVS32+1G-T), and a missense mutation in exon 37 (5361G-A)
resulting in a charged amino acid, arginine, being replaced by an
uncharged amino acid, glutamine (R1758Q). The corresponding cDNA
demonstrated that exon 32 was missing, resulting in an in-frame deletion
of 71 amino acids (L1456_N1526del) in the C-terminal region of the
smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (SM-MHC).

.0002
AORTIC ANEURYSM, FAMILIAL THORACIC 4
MYH11, 72-BP DEL

In the American kindred with AAT4 (132900) reported by Glancy et al.
(2001), Zhu et al. (2006) detected a heterozygous 72-nucleotide deletion
within exon 28 of the MYH11 gene (3810_3881del) that was not detected in
340 normal chromosomes. This in-frame deletion corresponds to the loss
of 24 amino acids (R1241_L1264del) in the C-terminal region of the
SM-MHC.

.0003
AORTIC ANEURYSM, FAMILIAL THORACIC 4
MYH11, LEU1264PRO

In affected members of a 3-generation family with aortic aneurysm and
patent ductus arteriosus (AAT4; 132900), Pannu et al. (2007) identified
2 closely linked missense mutations: a 3791T-C transition in the MYH11
gene, resulting in a leu1264-to-pro (L1264P), and a 3824G-T
transversion, resulting in an arg1275-to-leu (R1275L; 160745.0004)
substitution. Both mutations are in the coiled-coil domain.
Cosegregation of the 2 alterations suggested that the mutations are in
linkage disequilibrium.

In affected members of a family with aortic aneurysm and patent ductus
arteriosus (AAT4; 132900), Pannu et al. (2007) identified a 2153C-T
transition in the MYH11 gene, resulting in an arg712-to-gln (R712Q)
substitution in the ATPase head region. The proband's affected father
also had acute myocardial infarction (MI) at age 47 years, and a
mutation-positive brother died of MI at age 43 years.

613846	TITLE *613846 TECTONIC FAMILY, MEMBER 2; TCTN2
;;TECTONIC 2; TECT2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching databases for sequences similar to TCTN1 (609863), Reiter
and Skarnes (2006) identified mouse and human TCTN2 and TCTN3 (613847).
The deduced mouse Tctn2 protein contains 700 amino acids. It has an
N-terminal signal peptide and a C-terminal transmembrane domain that is
conserved in Drosophila tectonic.

MAPPING

Hartz (2011) mapped the TCTN2 gene to chromosome 12q24.31 based on an
alignment of the TCTN2 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK023037) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

GENE FUNCTION

Shaheen et al. (2011) performed RT-PCR to quantitate expression of Tctn2
in various mouse adult tissues. Tctn2 expression was identified in all
tissues, with significant expression in brain, kidney, and eye, organs
affected by the MKS phenotype. Studies of developmental expression in
the mouse detected significant expression at embryonic day 8.5 in the
neural tube, most notably in the rhombomere of the future hindbrain. By
embryonic day 10.5, Tctn2 mRNA was found throughout the mouse brain, the
length of the neural tube, and the growing edge of the limb buds, heart,
and eye. Furthermore, strong Tctn2 expression was observed in kidney
from embryonic day 14.5 mouse embryo.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Shaheen et al. (2011) identified homozygosity for a splice site mutation
in the TCTN2 gene (613846.0001) in a family segregating Meckel-Gruber
syndrome-8 (MKS8; 613885).

ANIMAL MODEL

Garcia-Gonzalo et al. (2011) found that Tctn2-null mouse embryos lacked
nodal cilia, and that cilia in neural tubes were scarce and
morphologically defective and failed to elongate axonemes. However,
basal bodies docked normally to the plasma membrane. Cilia numbers were
reduced in the limb bud mesenchyme, but cilia appeared normal. The
findings were similar to those of Tctn1 (609863)-null mice, indicating a
common function, and showed that Tctn1 and Tctn2 affect ciliogenesis in
a tissue-specific manner. Garcia-Gonzalo et al. (2011) also demonstrated
that Tctn2 and Tctn1 interact with other proteins in a large complex
localized to the transition zone between the ciliary axoneme and the
basal body.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MECKEL SYNDROME, TYPE 8
TCTN2, IVS13, A-G, -2

In affected members of a consanguineous Arab family with Meckel-Gruber
syndrome (MKS8; 613885), Shaheen et al. (2011) identified homozygosity
for a splice site mutation in the TCTN2 gene at the -2 position of exon
14 (1506-2A-G) that disrupted splicing and created 2 aberrant
transcripts. The first transcript introduces 104 basepairs from intron
13-14 and would delete 196 original amino acids, introduce 2 novel amino
acids, and prematurely truncate the 697-amino acid protein at residue
504. The second transcript lacks exon 14 and would delete 195 original
amino acids, introduce 4 novel amino acids, and prematurely truncate the
protein at residue 507. The mutation segregated with the disease in the
family and was not observed in 192 ethnically matched controls.

602091	TITLE *602091 LATENT TRANSFORMING GROWTH FACTOR-BETA-BINDING PROTEIN 2; LTBP2
;;LTBP3, FORMERLY
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Moren et al. (1994) identified a novel latent transforming growth
factor-beta binding protein (see LTBP1; 150390), designated LTBP2.

Ali et al. (2009) characterized the LTBP2 gene. The 1,821-amino acid
protein consists of 20 epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains, 4
transforming growth factor-beta binding protein (TB)-like modules each
containing 8 cysteine residues, and an N-terminal signal peptide.
Sixteen of the EGF domains have calcium-binding motifs, and it had been
suggested that these adopt a rod-like molecular arrangement upon calcium
binding in order to present a specific surface for protein-protein
interactions. The cysteine-containing TB domains are unique features of
the LTBP-fibrillin superfamily, providing a degree of conformational
flexibility. LTBP2 has approximately 45% amino acid identity to LTBP1
and 25% identity to fibrillin-1 (FBN1; 134797) but unlike other LTBP
family members does not bind to latent forms of TGFB (190180). The
C-terminal region of LTBP2 competes with LTBP1 for specific binding to
the N-terminal region of FBN1, but not FBN2 (612570), in microfibrils.

By RT-PCR analysis, Narooie-Nejad et al. (2009) showed high LTBP2
expression in human eyes, including the trabecular meshwork and ciliary
processes that are thought to be relevant to the etiology of primary
congenital glaucoma. Immunohistochemical analysis of human eye showed
highest LTBP2 expression in the Descemet membrane and in the lens
capsule, with expression also in the nonpigmented epithelium of the
ciliary processes, trabecular meshwork, and transitional zone between
the sclera and corneal stroma. Expression was minimal in corneal stroma,
sclera, and iris.

GENE FAMILY

See Oklu and Hesketh (2000) for a review of the LTBP gene family.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ali et al. (2009) determined that the LTBP2 gene comprises 35 exons.

MAPPING

Moren et al. (1994) mapped the LTBP2 gene to chromosome 14q24 by
analysis of somatic cell hybrids and by fluorescence in situ
hybridization.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Primary Congenital Glaucoma 3D

In 4 consanguineous Pakistani families and in 8 Gypsy individuals with
primary congenital glaucoma (GLC3D; 613086), Ali et al. (2009)
identified homozygous nonsense mutations in the LTBP2 gene. The data
suggested that R299X (602091.0001) is the major primary congenital
glaucoma founder mutation in the Gypsy population.

In 2 consanguineous Iranian families with primary congenital glaucoma,
Narooie-Nejad et al. (2009) independently identified respective
homozygous 1-bp deletions (602091.0006-602091.0007).

In 12 Roma/Gypsy probands with congenital glaucoma, Azmanov et al.
(2011) identified homozygosity for the R299X founder mutation. In an
additional patient, they identified compound heterozygosity for R299X
and a missense mutation in the CYP1B1 gene (R368H; 601771.0012).
However, the authors stated that their preliminary observations
suggested that CYP1B1/LTBP2 combinations in this and other patients were
of no clinical significance and that digenic inheritance was unlikely.

- Microspherophakia and/or Megalocornea, with Ectopia Lentis
and with or without Secondary Glaucoma

In 3 affected brothers from a consanguineous Indian family with isolated
microspherophakia and lens dislocation mapping to chromosome
14q24-q32.12 (251750), Kumar et al. (2010) identified homozygosity for a
frameshift mutation in the LTBP2 gene (602091.0005). Primary congenital
glaucoma was excluded in the affected sibs, and none had any systemic
involvement.

In 3 affected sibs from a consanguineous Moroccan family with
megalocornea, microspherophakia, ectopia lentis, and secondary glaucoma
mapping to chromosome 14q23.3-q24.3, Desir et al. (2010) analyzed the
candidate gene LTBP2 and identified homozygosity for a 1-bp insertion
(602091.0008). In a similarly affected girl of Macedonian Gypsy origin,
they identified homozygosity for the R299X mutation in LTBP2, previously
identified in patients with primary congenital glaucoma, including
patients of European Gypsy origin.

In 8 affected individuals from 3 consanguineous families with
megalocornea and secondary glaucoma due to spherophakia and/or ectopia
lentis, Khan et al. (2011) identified homozygosity for a 1-bp deletion,
a nonsense mutation, and a missense mutation (602091.0009-602091.0011,
respectively).

- Weill-Marchesani Syndrome 3

In affected members of a large consanguineous Iranian family with
Weill-Marchesani syndrome (WMS3; 614819), Haji-Seyed-Javadi et al.
(2012) identified homozygosity for a missense mutation (V1177M;
602091.0012) in the LTBP2 gene.

ANIMAL MODEL

Shipley et al. (2000) targeted disruption of Ltbp2 in mice. All died
between embryonic day 3.5 and 6.5. Ali et al. (2009) found expression of
mouse Ltbp2 in connective tissue throughout the body and in particular
spinal cord, cardiac, and skeletal muscles as well as renal and
seminiferous tubules.

NOMENCLATURE

The symbol LTBP3 was formerly used for LTBP2 in the literature, but
LTBP3 is the official symbol for a different LTBP gene; see 602090.

MICROSPHEROPHAKIA AND/OR MEGALOCORNEA, WITH ECTOPIA LENTIS AND WITH

LTBP2, ARG299TER

In affected members of a consanguineous Pakistani family with congenital
glaucoma (GLC3D; 613086), Ali et al. (2009) identified homozygosity for
a C-to-T transition at nucleotide 895 in exon 4 of the LTBP2 gene,
resulting in an arg-to-ter substitution at codon 299 (R299X).

Ali et al. (2009) also identified this mutation in 8 of 15 CYP1B1
(601771)-negative Gypsy patients. The authors suggested that R299X is
the major founder mutation in the Gypsy population, accounting for more
than 50% of CYP1B1-negative and nearly 40% of all PCG cases in that
population.

In 12 Roma/Gypsy probands with congenital glaucoma, Azmanov et al.
(2011) identified homozygosity for the R299X founder mutation. In an
additional patient, they identified compound heterozygosity for R299X
and a missense mutation in the CYP1B1 gene (R368H; 601771.0012).
However, the authors stated that their preliminary observations
suggested that CYP1B1/LTBP2 combinations in this and other patients were
of no clinical significance and that digenic inheritance was unlikely.

In a 3-year-old girl of Macedonian Gypsy origin with megalocornea,
microspherophakia, and lens dislocation (251750), Desir et al. (2010)
identified homozygosity for the R299X mutation in the LTBP2 gene. Her
unaffected parents were heterozygous for the mutation, which was not
found in 100 Caucasian controls. When initially seen at 2 years of age,
she had normal eye pressures, and still had not developed glaucoma at 3
years of age.

In a brother and 2 sisters from a consanguineous Moroccan family with
microspherophakia, megalocornea, lens dislocation, and secondary
glaucoma (251750), Desir et al. (2010) identified homozygosity for a
1-bp duplication (1796dupC) in exon 9 of the LTBP2 gene, causing a
frameshift predicted to result in a premature termination codon
(Val600GlyfsTer4). Their unaffected parents were heterozygous for the
mutation, which was not found in 100 Moroccan controls. Analysis of mRNA
from patient and control fibroblasts showed results consistent with
nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. The oldest sib, a 14-year-old boy,
displayed some marfanoid features (see Marfan syndrome, 154700)
including arm span greater than height, decreased upper-to-lower body
ratio, and high-arched palate.

.0009

In 2 male cousins, 2 years and 14 years old, from a consanguineous Saudi
Arabian family with megalocornea, lens dislocation, and secondary
glaucoma (251750), Khan et al. (2011) identified homozygosity for a 1-bp
deletion (1012delT) in exon 4 of the LTBP2 gene, causing a frameshift
predicted to result in a premature termination codon (Ser338ProfsTer2).
Their unaffected parents were all heterozygous for the mutation. The
older boy was tall and thin with a relatively high-arched palate, but
there were no other features to suggest Marfan syndrome (154700).

LTBP2, CYS1438TYR

In 2 brothers from a consanguineous Saudi Arabian family with
megalocornea, lens dislocation, and secondary glaucoma (251750), 1 of
whom also had microspherophakia, Khan et al. (2011) identified
homozygosity for a 4313G-A transition in exon 29 of the LTBP2 gene,
resulting in a cys1438-to-tyr (C1438Y) substitution at a conserved
residue. Their affected father and an affected paternal aunt were also
homozygous for the mutation, which was found in heterozygosity in the
boys' unaffected mother but was not present in 100 ethnically matched
controls.

.0012
WEILL-MARCHESANI SYNDROME 3
LTBP2, VAL1177MET

In an affected brother and sister and their affected cousin from a large
consanguineous Iranian family with Weill-Marchesani syndrome (WMS3;
614819), Haji-Seyed-Javadi et al. (2012) identified homozygosity for a
3529G-A transition in exon 24 of the LTBP2 gene, resulting in a
val1177-to-met (V1177M) substitution at a highly conserved residue
within the consensus calcium-binding sequence of the ninth
calcium-binding epidermal growth factor (131530)-like motif. The
mutation was also present in homozygosity in 3 more affected relatives
who displayed some features of Weill-Marchesani syndrome but had no
ocular abnormalities. Unaffected family members were either heterozygous
or homozygous for wildtype LTBP2, and the mutation was not found in 400
ethnically matched controls. Histologic examination of the extracellular
matrix (ECM) of skin fibroblasts from the proband revealed elastic
fibers that appeared clumped and fragmented compared to a control, and
electron micrography showed obvious disruption of the ECM in the
patient's skin, with notable reduction in abundance of collagen fibers
and increased space between adjacent fibers of the patient.
Haji-Seyed-Javadi et al. (2012) concluded that the V1177M mutation
disrupts microfibrils and causes changes in the substructure of the ECM.

608090	TITLE *608090 MLX-INTERACTING PROTEIN; MLXIP
;;MONDO FAMILY, MEMBER A; MONDOA;;
KIAA0867
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MONDOA forms heterodimers with MLX (602976) that can bind to and
activate transcription from CACGTG E boxes (Billin et al., 2000).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) cloned MONDOA, which they designated
KIAA0867. The MONDOA transcript contains an Alu sequence within the
3-prime untranslated region. RT-PCR ELISA detected low to moderate
expression in most tissues examined, with highest expression in brain,
liver, skeletal muscle, and ovary, and little to no expression in
spleen.

Using human MLX as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen, Billin et al. (2000)
cloned mouse Mondoa from a whole embryo cDNA library. They cloned human
MONDOA by screening an erythroleukemia cell line cDNA library using
mouse Mondoa as probe. The deduced 919-amino acid protein contains a
central serine-threonine-proline (STP)-rich domain, a basic
helix-loop-helix domain, a zipper region, and a C-terminal MLX homology
domain. The N terminus of MONDOA is conserved among MONDO proteins of
other species. Northern blot analysis detected a major transcript of
about 9.0 kb and a minor transcript of about 5.5 kb in most human
tissues tested, with highest expression in skeletal muscle. In situ
hybridization of mouse embryos detected broad Mondoa expression, with
slightly elevated levels in the developing central nervous system.

GENE FUNCTION

Billin et al. (2000) characterized mouse Mondoa. Mondoa and Mlx
associated in vivo, and the dimer localized primarily to the cytoplasm
of mouse embryonic carcinoma cells. Treatment of cells with a nuclear
export inhibitor resulted in nuclear accumulation of Mondoa and Mlx,
demonstrating that the heterodimer shuttles between the cytoplasmic and
nuclear compartments. The Mondoa-Mlx complex bound to the CACGTG E box
in vitro and, when artificially targeted to the nucleus of mouse
fibroblasts, drove reporter gene expression from the E box. Coexpression
of MLX with truncation mutants of human MONDOA identified a
transcription activation domain within the central STP-rich region of
MONDOA. By mutation analysis, Billin et al. (2000) identified a
cytoplasmic localization signal within the N terminus of human MONDOA
that contributed to the cytoplasmic localization of the MONDOA-MLX
complex.

Eilers et al. (2002) determined that 2 regions within the MONDOA N
terminus contribute to the cytoplasmic localization of the MONDOA-MLX
complex by functioning as a CRM1 (602559)-dependent nuclear export
signal and as a binding site for 14-3-3 (see 601289) proteins,
respectively. The conserved C terminus of MONDOA and MLX contains a
cytoplasmic localization signal that directs cytoplasmic localization of
the monomers and a protein-protein interaction domain that mediates
interaction between MONDOA and MLX. Heterodimerization of MONDOA and
MLX, via either the leucine zipper or the C-terminal domain, inactivates
the C-terminal cytoplasmic localization signal. Inactivation of this
domain is necessary but not sufficient for nuclear accumulation of the
heterodimer.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the MLXIP gene
to chromosome 12. Billin et al. (2000) mapped the MLXIP gene to
chromosome 12q21.31 by in situ hybridization.

601175	TITLE *601175 ADP-RIBOSYLATION FACTOR-LIKE 2; ARL2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The ARFs are small GTP-binding proteins of the RAS superfamily (see
ARF1, 103180). Clark et al. (1993) used degenerate PCR to clone human
ARL2, a member of a functionally distinct group of ARF-like genes. ARL2
encodes a 184-amino acid predicted protein that is 76% identical to ARF1
and about 40 to 45% identical to the Drosophila ARL proteins. Northern
blot analysis suggested ubiquitous transcription.

By immunohistochemical analysis of several mammalian cell lines,
including human, Zhou et al. (2006) found that ARL2 was expressed at
centrosomes, in cytoplasmic punctae, and in the nucleus. ARL2 localized
to centrosomes throughout the cell cycle, and its expression in other
structures was cell type specific.

GENE FUNCTION

Clark et al. (1993) found that recombinant ARL2 bound GTP rapidly.
However, guanine nucleotide exchange did not require phospholipids, a
characteristic of ARF proteins.

Bowzard et al. (2007) showed that both human ELMOD1 (615456) and ELMOD2
(610196), but not other ELMO domain-containing proteins, had GAP
activity toward ARL2.

Zhou et al. (2006) stated that ARL2 and ARL3 (604695) arose from a
common ancestor early in eukaryotic evolution and that they remain
highly related. However, they found that the 2 GTPases had distinct
effects on microtubule function in mammalian cells. Knockdown of ARL2 in
HeLa cells via RNA interference had little effect, but expression of
ARL2 with a dominant activating mutation caused failure of tubulin
polymerization, with loss of microtubules and microtubule-based mitotic
spindle, resulting in cell cycle arrest in M phase. In contrast,
knockdown of ARL3 using RNA interference changed HeLa cell morphology,
caused Golgi fragmentation, and increased acetylation of alpha-tubulin
(see 602259), which resulted in failure of cytokinesis and an elevated
number of binucleated cells. Overexpression of ARL3 had little effect.

The assembly of alpha/beta tubulin heterodimers requires the
participation of a series of chaperone proteins, some of which can
participate in the reverse microtubule-depolymerizing reaction. Using
HeLa cells, Tian et al. (2010) found that overexpression of the tubulin
chaperone TBCD (604649) caused microtubule depolymerization.
Coexpression of ARL2 inhibited microtubule depolymerization by
sequestering TBCD in an ARL2-TBCD interaction.

Using microarray analysis, quantitative PCR, and overexpression and
knockdown studies, Wang et al. (2011) found that binding of the microRNA
MIR16 (see 609704) to the 3-prime UTR of ARL2 caused downregulation of
ARL2 mRNA and protein expression in several human cell lines. MIR16
reduced proliferation and caused G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, at least in
part, through ARL2 downregulation. MIR16 also reduced cell migration,
but this effect was not mimicked by small interfering RNA directed
against ARL2.

Ismail et al. (2011) stated that PDE-delta (PDE6D; 602676) binds to
farnesylated small G proteins. They presented the 1.7-angstrom structure
of human PDE-delta in complex with C-terminally farnesylated human RHEB
(601293). PDE-delta interacted almost exclusively with the C-terminal
farnesyl moiety of RHEB, which was inserted within the farnesyl-binding
pocket of PDE-delta. The interaction did not require guanine nucleotide,
which bound RHEB on a surface nearly opposite to the PDE-delta-binding
site. PDE-delta also interacted with mouse Arl2. The interaction of
PDE-delta with Arl2 was dependent upon GTP and caused a conformational
change in PDE-delta that closed its farnesyl-binding pocket. In
solution, addition of Arl2-GTP dissociated the PDE-delta-farnesylated
RHEB complex. Addition of Arl3-GTP also caused release of farnesylated
RHEB from PDE-delta. In transfected canine kidney cells,
fluorescence-labeled RHEB showed endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi
localization. Addition of PDE-delta relocalized RHEB into a cytoplasmic
and nuclear distribution, and subsequent addition of Arl2-GTP restored
RHEB localization to ER and Golgi membranes. Ismail et al. (2011)
concluded that PDE-delta functions as a solubilization factor for
farnesylated RHEB and that ARL2 and ARL3 act in a GTP-dependent manner
as allosteric release factors for farnesylated RHEB.

MAPPING

Hartz (2013) mapped the ARL2 gene to chromosome 11q13.1 based on an
alignment of the ARL2 sequence (GenBank GENBANK L13687) with the genomic
sequence (GRCh37).

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Nagase et al. (1997) cloned a WNK1 cDNA, which they called KIAA0344. The
deduced protein contains 1,246 amino acids. RT-PCR detected highest
expression in kidney.

Using degenerate PCR against conserved kinase catalytic subdomains,
Moore et al. (2000) cloned human WNK1, which they called PSK. PSK
belongs to the STE20 family of serine-threonine kinases. The PSK protein
contains 1,235 amino acids and has an N-terminal kinase domain. PSK was
ubiquitously expressed in all tissues examined by Northern blot
analysis, with strongest expression in testis.

Xu et al. (2000) isolated a full-length rat cDNA encoding Wnk1 and
identified homologs in various species, including partial human
sequences. The N-terminal half of the deduced 2,126-amino acid rat
protein has a proline-rich region, followed by a serine/threonine kinase
domain and coiled-coil region, and the C-terminal half has a
proline-rich region and coiled-coil region. Wnk1 contains a cysteine
instead of the usual lysine at a key position in its active site.
Immunoblot analysis detected an endogenous 230-kD protein in rat brain
and several mammalian cell lines, including human embryonic kidney
(HEK293) cells. Most endogenous WNK1 protein was found in the
particulate fraction of HEK293 cells, suggesting that WNK1 is associated
with membranes or the cytoskeleton. Immunofluorescence analysis of
HEK293 cells transfected with rat Wnk1 revealed cytoplasmic staining.

Wilson et al. (2001) noted that the deduced human and rat WNK1 proteins
share 86% identity. By Northern blot analysis, they observed expression
of human WNK1 in most tissues, with 2 predominant isoforms: a 10-kb
transcript expressed at high levels in the kidney, and a 12-kb
transcript predominant in heart and skeletal muscle. By
immunofluorescence microscopy, Wilson et al. (2001) demonstrated that
WNK1 localizes to the distal convoluted tubule and the cortical
collecting duct, and is also abundant in the medullary collecting duct.

Choate et al. (2003) examined the distribution of WNK1 in extrarenal
tissues. Immunostaining using WNK1-specific antibodies demonstrated that
WNK1 was not present in all cell types; rather, it was predominantly
localized in polarized epithelia, including those lining the lumen of
the hepatic biliary ducts, pancreatic ducts, epididymis, sweat ducts,
colonic crypts, and gallbladder. WNK1 was also found in the basal layers
of epidermis and throughout the esophageal epithelium. Subcellular
localization of WNK1 varied among these epithelia. WNK1 was cytoplasmic
in kidney, colon, gallbladder, sweat duct, skin, and esophagus. In
contrast, it localized to the lateral membrane in bile ducts, pancreatic
ducts, and epididymis. These epithelia are all notable for their
prominent role in chloride-iron flux.

Using primer extension with human leukocyte and kidney RNA, 5-prime RACE
of human heart and kidney cDNA libraries, and RT-PCR of human heart,
skeletal muscle, and kidney RNA, Delaloy et al. (2003) characterized
several WNK1 variants resulting from tissue-specific splicing and the
use of multiple transcriptional start sites and polyadenylation sites.
Two promoters in exon 1 generate 2 ubiquitously expressed WNK1 isoforms
with complete kinase domains. A third promoter in exon 4A generates a
kidney-specific transcript that encodes an N-terminally truncated
protein that is kinase defective. Exon 4A is highly conserved between
human and rodents and encodes a cysteine-rich region. Northern blot
analysis detected a 9-kb transcript expressed predominantly in human
kidney and a 10.5-kb transcript expressed predominantly in skeletal
muscle, heart, and brain. Qualitative RT-PCR detected 10 times more
kinase-defective transcript than kinase domain-containing transcript in
human kidney mRNA. In situ hybridization of adult mouse kidney using an
exon 4A-specific probe revealed expression in kidney cortex,
predominantly in distal convoluted tubules.

- WNK1/HSN2 Isoform

Lafreniere et al. (2004) identified a novel gene, which they designated
HSN2, within the hereditary sensory neuropathy type II (HSAN2; 201300)
critical region on 12p13.33. The HSN2 gene encodes a deduced 434-amino
acid protein. Northern blot analysis of adult human tissues failed to
detect HSN2 transcripts, suggesting that the gene might be expressed at
very low levels. Lafreniere et al. (2004) suggested that the HSN2
protein may play a role in the development and/or maintenance of
peripheral sensory neurons or their supporting Schwann cells.

By Northern blot and RT-PCR analysis using mouse Wnk1, Shekarabi et al.
(2008) concluded that HSN2 is an alternatively spliced exon of WNK1 and
is part of a nervous system-specific isoform of WNK1, which they called
WNK1/HSN2. Northern blot analysis of mouse tissues showed a 10-kb
transcript exclusively expressed in nervous system tissues, including
the spinal cord, brain, and dorsal root ganglia. RT-PCR analysis
demonstrated that the Wnk1/Hsn2 isoform includes either the Hsn2 exon
alone or Hsn2 along with a novel exon 8B and lacks exons 11 and 12.
Immunohistochemical studies confirmed localization of the Wnk1/Hsn2
isoform to mouse nervous system tissues.

GENE STRUCTURE

Wilson et al. (2001) determined that the WNK1 gene contains 28 exons
that span 156 kb of genomic DNA.

Delaloy et al. (2003) identified 2 promoters in exon 1 of the WNK1 gene,
including 1 within the coding region, that generate ubiquitously
expressed WNK1 transcripts. A third promoter, located in the alternative
exon 4A within intron 4, generates a kidney-specific transcript. The
promoters lack TATA boxes, are GC-rich, and contain several
transcription factor-binding sites. A repressor element is present in
the most 5-prime promoter in exon 1. In addition, WNK1 has multiple
transcription start sites in exon 1 and 2 polyadenylation sites at its
3-prime end.

- WNK1/HSN2 Isoform

Lafreniere et al. (2004) determined that the HSN2 gene consists of a
single exon that is located within intron 8 of the WNK1 gene and
transcribed from the same strand. The authors initially concluded that
the WNK1 and HSN2 genes were differentially regulated. Subsequently,
Shekarabi et al. (2008) determined that HSN2 is a nervous-system
specific exon of the WNK1 gene, and they identified a novel exon 8B.

MAPPING

By analysis of a radiation hybrid panel, Nagase et al. (1997) mapped the
WNK1 gene to chromosome 12.

GENE FUNCTION

Moore et al. (2000) found that immunoprecipitated PSK phosphorylated
myelin basic protein (159430) and transfected PSK-stimulated MKK4
(601335) and MKK7 (603014), and activated the c-Jun N-terminal kinase
(JNK) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway (see 603014).
Microinjection of PSK into cells resulted in localization of PSK to a
vesicular compartment and caused a marked reduction in actin stress
fibers. In contrast, C-terminally truncated PSK did not localize to this
compartment or induce a decrease in stress fibers, demonstrating a
requirement for the C terminus. Kinase-defective PSK, carrying a
lys57-to-ala (K57A) mutation, was unable to reduce stress fibers.

Xu et al. (2002) expressed fragments of rat Wnk1 in bacteria and
identified an autoinhibitory region just C-terminal to the kinase
domain. The isolated autoinhibitory domain, which is conserved in all 4
human WNKs, suppressed the activity of the Wnk1 kinase domain. Mutation
of 2 conserved phenylalanines in the autoinhibitory domain (phe524 and
phe526 in rat Wnk1) attenuated its ability to inhibit Wnk1 kinase
activity, and the same mutations in a Wnk1 fragment containing the
autoinhibitory domain increased its kinase activity. Wnk1 expressed in
bacteria was autophosphorylated, and autophosphorylation of ser382 in
the activation loop was required for its activity.

Yang et al. (2003) found that mouse Wnk4 (601844) reduced the plasma
membrane association of the thiazide-sensitive sodium-chloride
cotransporter (NCC, or SLC12A3; 600968) in injected Xenopus oocytes.
They further demonstrated that Wnk1 did not affect Slc12a3-mediated
sodium uptake in oocytes, but coexpression of Wnk1 with both Wnk4 and
Slc12a3 restored sodium uptake to levels observed in oocytes expressing
Slc12a3 alone.

To investigate the mechanisms by which WNK1 and WNK4 interact to
regulate ion transport, Yang et al. (2005) performed experiments in
HEK293 cells and Xenopus oocytes which showed that the WNK4 C terminus
mediates SLC12A3 suppression, that the WNK1 kinase domain interacts with
the WNK4 kinase domain, and that WNK1 inhibition of WNK4 is dependent on
WNK1 catalytic activity and an intact WNK1 protein.

Yang et al. (2007) noted that WNK1, WNK4, and the kidney-specific WNK1
isoform interact to regulate SLC12A3 activity, suggesting that WNKs form
a signaling complex. They found that human WNK3 (300358), which is
expressed by distal tubule cells, interacted with rodent Wnk1 and Wnk4
to regulate SLC12A3 in cultured kidney cells and Xenopus oocytes.
Regulation of SLC12A3 in oocytes resulted from antagonism between WNK3
and Wnk4.

Lee et al. (2004) found that rat Wnk1 selectively bound to and
phosphorylated synaptotagmin-2 (SYT2; 600104) calcium-binding C2
domains. Endogenous Wnk1 and Syt2 coimmunoprecipitated and colocalized
on a subset of secretory granules in a rat insulinoma cell line.
Phosphorylation by Wnk1 increased the amount of Ca(2+) required for Syt2
binding to phospholipid vesicles. Lee et al. (2004) concluded that
phosphorylation of SYT2 by WNK1 can regulate Ca(2+) sensing and the
subsequent Ca(2+)-dependent interactions mediated by synaptotagmin C2
domains.

Lenertz et al. (2005) found that hypertonic stress activated rat Wnk1
when it was expressed in kidney epithelial cells and breast and colon
cancer cell lines. Hypotonic stress led to a modest increase in Wnk1
activity. Gel filtration suggested that Wnk1 exists as a tetramer, and
yeast 2-hybrid analysis revealed interaction between residues 1 to 222
of the Wnk1 N terminus and Wnk1 residues 481 to 660, which contain the
autoinhibitory domain and a coiled-coil region. Lenertz et al. (2005)
found no direct interaction between Wnk1 and Wnk4, but Wnk1
phosphorylated both Wnk2 (606249) and Wnk4, and the Wnk1 autoinhibitory
domain inhibited the catalytic activities of Wnk2 and Wnk4.

Using Xenopus oocytes and Chinese hamster ovary cells, Xu et al. (2005)
showed that WNK1 controls ion permeability by activating SGK1 (602958),
leading to activation of the epithelial sodium channel (see SCNN1A;
600228). Increased WNK1-induced channel activity depended on SGK1 and
the E3 ubiquitin ligase, NEDD4-2 (NEDD4L; 606384).

Alternative splicing of WNK1 produces a kidney-specific short form that
lacks a kinase domain, KS-WNK1, and a more ubiquitous long form, L-WNK1.
Using reconstitution studies in Xenopus oocytes, Wade et al. (2006)
found that rat L-Wnk1 inhibited the K+ channel Kir1.1 (KCNJ1; 600359) by
reducing its cell surface localization, and this inhibition required an
intact kinase domain. Ks-Wnk1 did not directly alter Kir1.1 channel
activity, but it acted as a dominant-negative inhibitor of L-Wnk1 and
released Kir1.1 from inhibition. Acute dietary potassium loading in rats
increased the relative abundance of Ks-Wnk1 to L-Wnk1 transcript and
protein in kidney, indicating that physiologic upregulation of Kir1.1
activity involves a WNK1 isoform switch.

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis of Jurkat human T cells and
immunoprecipitation analysis of human embryonic kidney cells and HeLa
cells, Anselmo et al. (2006) showed that OSR1 (OXSR1; 604046) and WNK1
interacted through conserved C-terminal motifs. OSR1 was phosphorylated
in a WNK1-dependent manner, and depletion of WNK1 from HeLa cells with
small interfering RNA reduced OSR1 kinase activity. Depletion of either
WNK1 or OSR1 reduced Na-K-Cl cotransporter (NKCC; see 600839) activity,
suggesting that WNK1 and OSR1 are required for NKCC function.

He et al. (2007) showed that mammalian Wnk1 and Wnk4 interacted with the
endocytic scaffold protein intersectin-1 (ITSN1; 602442) and that these
interactions were crucial for stimulation of Romk1 (KCNJ1) endocytosis.
Stimulation of Romk1 endocytosis by Wnk1 and Wnk4 required their
proline-rich motifs, but it did not require their kinase activities.
Pseudohypoaldosteronism II (145260)-causing mutations in Wnk4 enhanced
the interactions of Wnk4 with Itsn1 and Romk1, leading to increased
endocytosis of Romk1.

Yang et al. (2007) showed that coexpression of rodent Wnk1 and Wnk4 with
human CFTR (602421) suppressed CFTR-dependent chloride channel activity
in Xenopus oocytes. The effect of Wnk4 was dose dependent, independent
of Wnk4 kinase activity, and occurred, at least in part, by reducing
CFTR protein abundance at the plasma membrane. In contrast, the effect
of Wnk1 on CFTR activity required Wnk1 kinase activity. Moreover, Wnk1
and Wnk4 exhibited additive CFTR inhibition.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Pseudohypoaldosteronism Type IIC

Wilson et al. (2001) identified WNK1 as the gene mutant in one form of
pseudohypoaldosteronism type II (PHA2C; 614492), an autosomal dominant
disorder characterized by hypertension, hyperkalemia, and renal tubular
acidosis. In a 10-member kindred segregating PHAII, they identified a
41-kb deletion in intron 1 of WNK1 (605232.0001). In the family
previously described by Disse-Nicodeme et al. (2000), they identified a
22-kb deletion within intron 1 of WNK1 (605232.0002). Wilson et al.
(2001) found that affected individuals carrying the 22-kb deletion had a
5-fold increase in the level of WNK1 transcripts in leukocytes relative
to those of their unaffected relatives, thus demonstrating that the
deletion alters WNK1 expression.

- Hereditary Sensory and Autonomic Neuropathy II

Among from 5 families with HSAN2, including 2 from Newfoundland, 2 from
rural Quebec, and 2 from Nova Scotia, Lafreniere et al. (2004)
identified 3 different truncating mutations in the WNK1 gene (594delA,
605232.0003; 918insA, 605232.0004; Q315X, 605232.0005).

Roddier et al. (2005) identified 2 founder mutations in the WNK1 gene
(918insA and Q315X) that were responsible for HSAN2 in the southern part
of Quebec.

Coen et al. (2006) reported 3 unrelated patients with HSAN2 from Italy,
Austria, and Belgium, respectively. All had compound heterozygous or
homozygous truncating mutations in the WNK1 gene, resulting in complete
loss of protein function. All patients had early onset of a severe
sensory neuropathy with mutilating acropathy but without autonomic
dysfunction. Muscle strength was preserved.

- Hypokalemic Salt-Losing Renal Tubulopathy

Zhang et al. (2013) studied 44 Chinese patients with hypokalemia of
unknown cause, metabolic alkalosis, and normal to low blood pressure. In
33 patients, they identified homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for
known mutations in the CLCNKB (602023) or SLC12A3 (600968) genes,
associated with forms of Bartter syndrome (see 607364) and Gitelman
syndrome (263800), respectively. Of the 11 remaining patients, 8 were
heterozygous for a mutation in the SLC12A3 gene, whereas in 3, no
mutation was detected in either gene. Screening for mutations in the
candidate genes WNK1 and WNK4 (601844) revealed heterozygosity for 2
missense mutations in WNK1 (605232.0012 and 605232.0013, respectively)
in 2 of the 11 patients, both of whom were also heterozygous for a known
mutation in SLC12A3, each of which had previously been reported in a
patient diagnosed with Gitelman syndrome (Simon et al., 1996 and Shao et
al., 2008, respectively). No mutations were detected in WNK4. Zhang et
al. (2013) suggested that inactivating mutations in WNK1 may cause
salt-losing renal tubulopathy, which represents a phenotype that is the
converse of PHAII, caused by WNK1 gain-of-function mutations.

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

In a girl with HSAN2, Shekarabi et al. (2008) identified compound
heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the WNK1 gene: 1 in the WNK1/HSN2
isoform (605232.0010) and 1 in the WNK1 isoform (605232.0011). She did
not have hypertension. The authors noted that all recessive mutations
associated with the HSAN2 phenotype resulted in truncations of the
WNK1/HSN2 nervous system-specific protein. Disease-causing mutations in
WNK1 resulting in PHA2C were large, heterozygous intronic deletions that
increase the gene expression. This impact on the expression level in
PHA2C patients may explain the absence of hypertension in individuals
affected with HSAN2, as the expression of the WNK1 isoform in which the
HSN2 exon is not incorporated should not be affected. The findings in
their patient suggested that 1 mutation in the HSN2 exon is sufficient
to cause the HSAN2 phenotype when combined with a mutation in WNK1 on
the other allele. Moreover, homozygous mutations disrupting WNK1
isoforms without HSN2 may be lethal, which would explain why all
loss-of-function mutations reported to date have been located in the
HSN2 exon.

ANIMAL MODEL

To accelerate the genetic determination of gene function, Zambrowicz et
al. (2003) developed a sequence-tagged gene-trap library of more than
270,000 mouse embryonic stem cell clones representing mutations in
approximately 60% of mammalian genes. Through the generation and
phenotypic analysis of knockout mice from this resource, they undertook
a functional screen to identify genes regulating physiologic parameters
such as blood pressure. As part of this screen, mice deficient for the
Wnk1 gene were generated and analyzed. Genetic studies in humans had
shown that large intronic deletions in WNK1 lead to its overexpression
and are responsible for pseudohypoaldosteronism type II (Wilson et al.,
2001), an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by hypertension,
increased renal salt reabsorption, and impaired potassium and hydrogen
excretion. Consistent with the human genetic studies, Wnk1 heterozygous
mice displayed a significant decrease in blood pressure. Mice homozygous
for the Wnk1 mutation died during embryonic development before day 13 of
gestation. Zambrowicz et al. (2003) concluded that WNK1 is a regulator
of blood pressure critical for development and illustrated the utility
of a functional screen driven by a sequence-based mutagenesis approach.

et al. (2004) identified a homozygous 1-bp deletion in the HSN2 exon of
the WNK1 gene, 594delA, resulting in a frameshift at codon 198 with a

In 2 sisters from Nova Scotia, born to consanguineous parents, with
hereditary sensory neuropathy type II (201300), Lafreniere et al. (2004)
found homozygosity for a 1-bp insertion in the HSN2 exon of the WNK1
gene, 918insA, resulting in a frameshift at codon 307 with a premature

is based on the HSN exon ORF only.

Roddier et al. (2005) identified the 918insA mutation in 7 (58%) of 12
HSAN2 patients from the Lanaudiere region of southern Quebec, suggesting
a founder effect. One patient was homozygous, and 6 were compound

transition in the HSN2 exon of the WNK1 gene, resulting in a
gln315-to-ter substitution (Q315X) predicted to truncate the protein to
314 amino acids. In 2 French Canadian sisters with HSAN2, the Q315X
mutation was found in compound heterozygous state with the 918insA
mutation (605343.0004) in the HSN2 exon. Numbering of this mutation is
based on the HSN exon ORF only.

In affected members of families with HSAN2 (201300) from the the
southern part of Quebec, Roddier et al. (2005) identified the Q315X
mutation. Nine (56%) of 16 patients were homozygous for the mutation,
and 6 (38%) of 16 patients were compound heterozygous with the 918insA
mutation. Most of the patients were from the Lanaudiere region. Regional
carrier frequency of the Q315X mutation was estimated to range from 1 in

WNK1, 1-BP INS, 1134T

In a 28-year-old Korean man with HSAN2 (201300), Cho et al. (2006)
identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the HSN2 exon of
the WNK1 gene: a 1-bp insertion (1134insT) and a 217C-T transition,
resulting in a gln73-to-ter (Q73X; 605232.0009) substitution. The
patient had childhood onset of the disorder and amputation of both lower
limbs and several fingers due to ulceration and infection. The patient's
unaffected mother was heterozygous for the 1-bp insertion, and 3
unaffected sibs were heterozygous for the Q73X mutation. The father was
deceased. Numbering of this mutation is based on the HSN exon ORF only.

Takagi et al. (2006) identified homozygosity for the 1134insT mutation
in a Japanese patient with HSAN2, born of consanguineous parents. The
insertion results in frameshift and premature termination of the protein
at residue 378. The patient noted that he felt no pain in his
extremities during his teenage years. He had recurrent skin ulcers on
his fingers and toes resulting in spontaneous or surgical amputation of
several digit tips. Physical examination at age 39 years showed no
autonomic involvement.

In an 18-year-old French girl with HSAN2 (201300), Shekarabi et al.
(2008) identified a heterozygous 1-bp deletion (639delA) in the HSN2
exon of the WNK1 gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature
termination. Numbering of this mutation is based on the HSN exon ORF
only. Her unaffected father and brother also carried the heterozygous
mutation. Screening of the rest of the WNK1/HSN2 isoform did not reveal
any mutations. However, subsequent screening of the girl in other exons
in the WNK1 gene revealed a heterozygous 2-bp deletion (1584_1585delAG;
605232.0011) in exon 6 of the WNK1 gene, which resulted in frameshift at
codon 531 and premature termination at codon 547 (asp531fsX547). This
mutation was inherited from the unaffected mother. Neither the girl nor
the mother showed signs of hypertension. The findings prompted Shekarabi
et al. (2008) to concluded that HSN2 is an alternative exon within WNK1,
rather than an independent gene.

VARIANT OF UNKNOWN SIGNIFICANCE
WNK1, ILE1172MET

This variant is classified as a variant of unknown significance because
its contribution to hypokalemic salt-losing renal tubulopathy (see
241150) has not been confirmed due to the presence of an additional
heterozygous mutation in the SLC12A3 gene (600968).

In a Chinese patient who presented at 10 years of age with fatigue,
numbness, enuresis, and nocturia and was found to have hypokalemia,
metabolic alkalosis, and low to normal blood pressure and to be
heterozygous for a known splice site mutation (7426del13ins12; Shao et
al., 2008) in the SLC12A3 gene, Zhang et al. (2013) identified
heterozygosity for an A-G transition in exon 16 of the WNK1 gene,
resulting in an ile1172-to-met (I1172M) substitution at an
evolutionarily conserved residue within a coiled-coil domain in the C
terminus. The I1172M mutation arose de novo, as neither parent carried
the WNK1 variant, and it was not found in 400 control alleles or
reported in dbSNP or HGMD databases. However, his unaffected mother was
heterozygous for the SLC12A3 indel splice site mutation. Functional
analysis in HEK293 cells using the corresponding rat WNK1 mutation,
I918M, showed reduced SLC12A3 protein membrane expression in vitro when
cotransfected with WNK4, due to complete abolishment of the suppressive
effect of WNK4-mediated inhibition.

VARIANT OF UNKNOWN SIGNIFICANCE
WNK1, SER2047ASN

This variant is classified as a variant of unknown significance because
its contribution to hypokalemic salt-losing renal tubulopathy (see
241150) has not been confirmed due to the presence of an additional
heterozygous mutation in the SLC12A3 gene (600968).

In a Chinese man who presented at age 26 years with fatigue and
hypotonia and was found to have hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, and
low to normal blood pressure and to be heterozygous for a known missense
mutation (D486N; Simon et al., 1996) in the SLC12A3 gene, Zhang et al.
(2013) identified heterozygosity for a G-A transition in exon 24 of the
WNK1 gene, resulting in a ser2047-to-asn (S2047N) substitution at a
highly conserved residue within a coiled-coil domain in the C terminus.
The S2047N WNK1 mutation was inherited from his father, who also
displayed hypokalemia, alkalosis, and hypotension; the WNK1 variant was
not found in 400 control alleles or reported in dbSNP or HGMD databases.
The affected father and the patient's asymptomatic 2-year-old daughter
also carried the SLC12A3 mutation, which was not found in other
asymptomatic family members.

186973	TITLE *186973 IL2-INDUCIBLE T-CELL KINASE; ITK
;;TYROSINE KINASE EXPRESSED MAINLY IN T CELLS; EMT;;
T-CELL ITK/TSK TYROSINE KINASE, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The ITK gene encodes IL2 (147680)-inducible T-cell kinase, which is
important for proper T-cell development, T-cell receptor (TCR)
signaling, cytokine release, and regulation of differentiation. ITK is
analogous to Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK; 300300), which is specifically
expressed in B cells and instrumental for their undisturbed development,
differentiation, and signaling (summary by Linka et al., 2012).

CLONING

Signal transduction through the T-cell receptor (TCR; see 186880) and
cytokine receptors on the surface of T lymphocytes occurs largely via
tyrosine phosphorylation of intracellular substrates. Signal
transduction is thought to occur via association of these receptors with
intracellular protein tyrosine kinases. To identify unique T-cell
tyrosine kinases, Gibson et al. (1993) used PCR-based cloning with
degenerate oligonucleotides directed at highly conserved motifs of
tyrosine kinase domains. In this way, they cloned the complete cDNA for
a unique human tyrosine kinase that is expressed mainly in T lymphocytes
and natural killer (NK) cells. The cDNA predicted an open reading frame
of 1,866 bp encoding a protein with a predicted size of 72 kD, which was
in keeping with its size on Western blotting. A single 6.2-kb mRNA and
72-kD protein were detected in T lymphocytes and NK-like cell lines, but
were not detected in other cell lineages. Sequence comparisons suggested
that the protein is probably the human homolog of a murine
interleukin-2-inducible T-cell kinase (ITK). However, unlike ITK, the
message and protein levels for the new entity did not vary markedly on
stimulation of human IL-2 responsive T cells with IL-2. They referred to
the gene and its protein product as EMT ('expressed mainly in T cells').
They concluded that EMT is a member of a new family of intracellular
kinases that includes BPK (the kinase mutant in X-linked
agammaglobulinemia, 300300). The expression of EMT message and protein
in thymocytes and mature T cells, combined with its homology to BPK and
its chromosomal localization, suggested that EMT may play a role in
thymic ontogeny and growth regulation of mature T cells.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

ITK is the T-cell-specific homolog of Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK),
which is mutant in X-linked agammaglobulinemia (300300). Cheng et al.
(1994) showed that BTK interacts with 3 protein-tyrosine kinases that
get activated upon stimulation of B- and T-cell receptors. These
interactions are mediated by two 10-amino acid motifs in BTK; an
analogous site with the same specificity is also present in ITK.

GENE FUNCTION

Integrin adhesion receptors mediate critical interactions of T cells
with other cells and extracellular matrix components during trafficking,
as well as during antigen-specific recognition events in tissue.
Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K; see 601232) has a role in the
regulation of integrin activity by CD3 (see 186790)-TCR and in the
regulation of ITK. Woods et al. (2001) determined that TCR-mediated
activation of beta-1 integrins (see ITGB1; 135630) requires activation
of ITK and PI3K-dependent recruitment of ITK to detergent-insoluble
glycosphingolipid-enriched microdomains (DIGs) via binding of the
pleckstrin homology domain of ITK to the PI3K product PI(3,4,5)-P3.
Likewise, activation of PI3K and LCK (153390) via CD4 (186940)
coreceptor stimulation can initiate beta-1 integrin activation dependent
on ITK function. CD4 stimulation, together with targeting of ITK to
DIGs, also activates TCR-independent beta-1 integrin function. Changes
in beta-1 integrin function mediated by TCR-induced activation of ITK
are accompanied by ITK-dependent modulation of the actin cytoskeleton.
Woods et al. (2001) concluded that TCR-mediated activation of beta-1
integrin involves membrane relocalization and activation of ITK via
coordinate action of PI3K and an SRC family tyrosine kinase.

Hwang et al. (2005) reported that TBET (604895) represses Th2 lineage
commitment through tyrosine kinase-mediated interaction between itself
and GATA3 (131320) that interferes with the binding of GATA3 to its
target DNA. Hwang et al. (2005) concluded that their results provide a
novel function for tyrosine phosphorylation of a transcription factor in
specifying alternate fates of a common progenitor cell. Hwang et al.
(2005) showed that TBET phosphorylation is restricted to the TEC kinases
ITK and RLK (600058). Coexpression studies demonstrated that this was
most efficiently performed by ITK. In primary CD4 T cells isolated from
ITK-, RLK-, or double ITK/RLK-deficient mice, the greatest diminution of
TBET tyrosine phosphorylation was seen in the absence of ITK.
Furthermore, mutation of TBET at tyrosine residue 525, but not control
tyrosine residue 437, resulted in greatly reduced phosphorylation by
ITK, revealing that ITK phosphorylates TBET at residue Y525 after T cell
receptor stimulation.

Huang et al. (2007) showed that phosphorylation of inositol
1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) into IP4 promoted pleckstrin homology domain
binding to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate and was required for
full activation of Itk in primary mouse thymocytes. They proposed that
IP4 establishes a feedback loop of phospholipase C-gamma-1 (PLCG1;
172420) activation through ITK that is essential for T-cell development.

MAPPING

Gibson et al. (1993) mapped the EMT gene to chromosome 5q31-q32 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization. By fluorescence in situ
hybridization, Janis et al. (1994) mapped the human ITK gene to
5q32-q33. By Southern blot analysis of DNA from the progeny of 2
multilocus crosses, the murine Itk gene was mapped to chromosome 11 in a
region of homology to human 5q. The region in humans is frequently
deleted in the myelodysplastic syndrome.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 2 sisters with autosomal recessive fatal EBV-associated
lymphoproliferative syndrome-1 (LPFS1; 613011), Huck et al. (2009)
identified a homozygous mutation in the ITK gene (R355W; 186973).

In 3 members of a consanguineous Arab family with lymphoproliferative
syndrome-1, Stepensky et al. (2011) identified a homozygous truncating
mutation in the ITK gene (Y588X; 186973.0002). The mutation, which was
found by homozygosity mapping followed by candidate gene sequencing,
segregated with the disorder in the family.

In a patient, born of consanguineous Moroccan parents, with
lymphoproliferative syndrome-1, Linka et al. (2012) identified a
homozygous missense mutation in the ITK gene (R29H; 186973.0003). Linka
et al. (2012) performed functional studies on cells from the patients
reported by Huck et al. (2009), Stepensky et al. (2011), and Linka et
al. (2012), and found that all had a reduced calcium signaling response
after TCR stimulation and were unable to enhance calcium response in
Itk-null mouse cells, consistent with a loss of function. In vitro
studies showed that all mutant proteins had reduced half-lives; the R29H
mutation impeded membrane targeting of ITK.

ANIMAL MODEL

By homologous recombination, Schaeffer et al. (1999) disrupted the Rlk
(TXK; 600058) gene in mice. Heterozygotes were completely normal.
Homozygous null Rlk mice showed increased amounts of Itk mRNA. The
authors hypothesized that upregulation of related Tec kinases may
partially compensate for the lack of Rlk. Schaeffer et al. (1999)
therefore generated Rlk -/- Itk -/- mice by interbreeding. Itk-deficient
mice have reduced numbers of mature T cells, particularly CD4+ cells,
causing a decreased CD4-to-CD8 ratio. Rlk -/- Itk -/- mutants, however,
had normal T cell numbers. Both CD4+ and CD8+ cell numbers are increased
relative to Itk -/- mice. The persistent abnormal ratio of CD4+ to CD8+
cells suggested an altered regulation of lymphoid development and
homeostasis in the double mutants. The double mutants had marked defects
in T-cell receptor responses including proliferation, cytokine
production, and apoptosis in vitro and adaptive immune responses to
Toxoplasma gondii in vivo. Molecular events immediately downstream from
the T-cell receptor were intact in Rlk -/- Itk -/- cells, but
intermediate events including inositol trisphosphate production, calcium
mobilization, and mitogen-activated protein kinase activation were
impaired, establishing Tec kinases as critical regulators of T-cell
receptor signaling required for phospholipase C-gamma activation.

Using flow cytometry, Dubois et al. (2006) found that Il15 (600554) -/-
mice lacked Cd44 (107269)-hi/Cd122 (IL2RB; 146710)-hi memory phenotype
Cd8-positive T cells in both the periphery and thymus, whereas Itk -/-
mice lacked Cd44-lo/Cd122-lo naive Cd8-positive T cells in the periphery
and thymus. Mice lacking both Itk and Il15 had a severe reduction of all
CD8-positive T cells. Dubois et al. (2006) proposed that there are 2
distinct populations of CD8-positive T cells dependent on ITK or IL15,
and that the IL15-dependent CD44-hi/CD122-hi memory phenotype
CD8-positive T cells have functions in both innate and adaptive
immunity.

Broussard et al. (2006) found that Cd8-positive T cells from mice
lacking Itk or both Itk and Rlk expressed memory markers (e.g., Cd44 and
Cd122) and rapidly produced Ifng (147570). Itk deficiency greatly
increased the number of cells selected by MHC class Ib. Broussard et al.
(2006) concluded that the absence of TEC kinases prevents conventional
CD8-positive T-cell development and leads to generation of a large
population of nonconventional innate-type CD8-positive T cells. Atherly
et al. (2006) presented similar findings.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
LYMPHOPROLIFERATIVE SYNDROME 1
ITK, ARG335TRP

In 2 Turkish sisters, born of consanguineous parents, with fatal
EBV-associated lymphoproliferative syndrome-1 (LPFS1; 613011), Huck et
al. (2009) identified a homozygous 1085C-T transition in exon 11 of the
ITK gene, resulting in an arg335-to-trp (R335W) substitution in a highly
conserved residue in the BG loop of the SH2 domain. Attempts to
functionally express the R335W mutant in bacteria failed due to
aggregation of the recombinant protein, whereas wildtype protein was
stable and expressed functionally at high levels. Functional expression
in 293T cells showed mRNA expression of the mutant transcript, but
nearly undetectable ITK protein, consistent with severe protein
instability. Both girls developed chronic active EBV infection in early
childhood that was resistant to treatment. The disorder progressed to
lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, B-cell proliferation, and Hodgkin
lymphoma in 1 girl. There were extremely low levels of the protein in
lymph node biopsy from 1 of the girls. Both unaffected parents were
heterozygous for the mutation. The mutation was not identified in 100
Turkish and 100 German children.

Linka et al. (2012) showed that cells from the patients reported by Huck
et al. (2009) had a reduced calcium signaling response after TCR
stimulation and were unable to enhance calcium response in Itk-null
mouse cells, consistent with a loss of function.

LYMPHOPROLIFERATIVE SYNDROME 1
ITK, TYR588TER

In 3 members of a consanguineous Arab family with lymphoproliferative
syndrome-1 (613011), Stepensky et al. (2011) identified a homozygous
c.1764C-G transversion in exon 16 of the ITK gene, resulting in a
tyr588-to-ter (Y588X) substitution that would disrupt the ITK kinase
domain. The mutation, which was found by homozygosity mapping followed
by candidate gene sequencing, segregated with the disorder in the
family. The patients presented between ages 3 and 5 years with fever,
lymphadenopathy, and Hodgkin lymphoma associated with EBV infection. One
patient was treated successfully with chemotherapy but later developed
fatal hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis; the second patient was treated
successfully with chemotherapy but later developed autoimmune renal
disease and was treated successfully with antiviral therapy; and the
third patient underwent successful bone marrow transplant from a donor
sib who was heterozygous for the mutation.

Linka et al. (2012) showed that cells from the patient reported by
Stepensky et al. (2011) had a reduced calcium signaling response after
TCR stimulation and were unable to enhance calcium response in Itk-null
mouse cells, consistent with a loss of function.

LYMPHOPROLIFERATIVE SYNDROME 1
ITK, ARG29HIS

In a patient, born of consanguineous Moroccan parents, with
lymphoproliferative syndrome-1 (613011), Linka et al. (2012) identified
a homozygous c.86G-A transition in the ITK gene, resulting in an
arg29-to-his (R29H) substitution in the pleckstrin homology domain. The
patient was diagnosed at age 11 years with an EBV-associated B-cell
lymphoproliferative disorder. He also had autoimmune hemolytic anemia,
thrombocytopenia, and progressive lymphopenia. He died at age 26 years.
Patient cells had a reduced calcium signaling response after TCR
stimulation and were unable to enhance calcium response in Itk-null
mouse cells, consistent with a loss of function. In vitro studies showed
that the R29H mutation impeded membrane targeting of ITK.

605551	TITLE *605551 NITRIC OXIDE SYNTHASE 1 (NEURONAL) ADAPTOR PROTEIN; NOS1AP
;;C-TERMINAL PDZ DOMAIN LIGAND OF NEURONAL NITRIC OXIDE SYNTHASE; CAPON
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using the first 377 amino acids of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (NOS1;
163731) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen, Jaffrey et al. (1998)
isolated cDNAs encoding rat NOS1AP, which they called CAPON. One cDNA
encoded a deduced 125-amino acid protein and the other a 327-amino acid
protein. The N-terminal 145-amino acid stretch had residues suggestive
of a phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain. Northern blot analysis
detected a predominant 7.5-kb transcript only in rat brain regions, with
no expression evident in adrenal, bladder, heart, kidney, lung, and
skeletal muscle. Marked regional variations occurred in brain, with
highest density in the cerebral cortex and medulla oblongata and lowest
levels in the hippocampus.

By PCR of a human fetal brain cDNA library, Xu et al. (2005) cloned 2
splice variants of NOS1AP, NOS1AP-L and NOS1AP-S. NOS1AP-L encodes the
deduced full-length, 501-amino acid protein, which contains an
N-terminal PTB domain and a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain. NOS1AP-S
encodes a deduced 211-amino acid protein with a unique 18-amino acid N
terminus and a C terminus containing the PDZ-binding domain. Western
blot analysis of human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex samples revealed
major NOS1AP proteins with apparent molecular masses of 75 kD and 30 kD.
Other minor bands were detected and may represent variably
phosphorylated forms.

GENE STRUCTURE

Xu et al. (2005) determined that the NOS1AP gene contains 10 exons.
NOS1AP-S contains only exons 9 and 10 and has much longer 5-prime and
3-prime UTRs than NOS1AP-L.

MAPPING

Seki et al. (1997) mapped the NOS1AP gene, which they called KIAA0464,
to chromosome 1 by radiation hybrid analysis.

GENE FUNCTION

Jaffrey et al. (1998) showed that CAPON and NOS1 interacted in vivo and
in vitro and colocalized in rat brain. The 125-amino acid C-terminal
fragment of CAPON specifically interacted with NOS1 in a 2-hybrid
system. CAPON was found to compete with PSD95 (602887) for interaction
with NOS1, and overexpression of CAPON resulted in a loss of PSD95-NOS1
complexes in transfected cells. Jaffrey et al. (1998) concluded that
CAPON may influence NOS1 by regulating its ability to associate with
PSD95-NMDA receptor complexes. They proposed a model of PSD95-NOS1
regulation by CAPON in which NMDA receptors are coupled to NOS1 through
a PSD95 multimer; these interactions are mediated by PDZ domains. In
this complex, NOS1 is situated close to NMDA receptor-modulated calcium
influx. Binding of CAPON results in the reduction of NMDA
receptor-PSD95-NOS1 complexes, leading to a decreased access to NMDA
receptor-gated calcium influx and a catalytically inactive enzyme.

Chang et al. (2008) found that Capon was expressed in guinea pig heart
and interacted with Nos1 to accelerate cardiac repolarization by
inhibiting L-type calcium channels (see CACNA1C; 114205).

Carrel et al. (2009) found that overexpression of human NOS1AP-L in
cultured rat hippocampal neurons significantly reduced primary and
secondary dendrite numbers. Conversely, downregulation of Nos1ap-l via
short hairpin RNA increased primary and secondary dendrite numbers.
Mutation analysis showed that a middle region of NOS1AP played an
essential role in mediating NOS1AP-L action. Yeast 2-hybrid analysis of
rat brain lysates showed that this domain bound Cpe (114855), and the
interaction of NOS1AP-L with Cpe was confirmed by immunoprecipitation
analysis and protein pull-down assays. Knockdown of Cpe in hippocampal
neurons abrogated the effect of NOS1AP-L overexpression, although
knockdown of Cpe alone had little effect on dendrite branching.
Overexpression of human NOS1AP-S also inhibited dendrite branching, but
only when it was overexpressed in young cultures. NOS1AP-S also lacks
the CPE-binding domain of NOS1AP-L, suggesting that it inhibits dendrite
branching through a different mechanism.

613785	TITLE *613785 COMPLEMENT COMPONENT 1, r SUBCOMPONENT; C1R
;;COMPLEMENT COMPONENT C1r
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The complement system is a major mediator of innate immunity. The first
enzymatic event in the cascade of the classical pathway of complement is
the activation of its first component, C1. C1 is a multimolecular
complex consisting of 2 loosely interacting entities: C1q (see 120550),
the recognition subunit, and C1r(2)/C1s(2), the catalytic one.
C1r(2)/C1s(2) is a tetrameric Ca(2+)-dependent complex of C1r and C1s
(120580), 2 serine-proteinase zymogens. C1r acts by transforming the
activation signal (the fixation of C1q on activating reagents, e.g.,
immune complexes) into an enzymic activity (summary by Journet and Tosi,
1986).

CLONING

Leytus et al. (1986) reported the nucleotide sequence for cDNA coding
for C1r. Journet and Tosi (1986) cloned and sequenced a full-length cDNA
for the C1r precursor, which contains a 17-amino acid leader peptide,
followed by a mature 688-amino acid protein.

MAPPING

By means of a cDNA in somatic cell hybrids, Cohen-Haguenauer et al.
(1986) assigned the C1R and C1S genes to chromosome 12. Leppert et al.
(1987) found a maximum lod score of 5.99 at theta = 0.038 for linkage
between C1S and one of the PRP loci (see 168710); the maximum lod score
between C1R and another PRP locus was 4.21 at theta = 0.001. Although
C1r and C1s are structurally and functionally similar, with a
significant degree of sequence homology suggesting origin by gene
duplication, cDNA probes for human C1r and C1s do not cross-hybridize
even at mild stringency conditions and are therefore gene-specific.
Using a panel of human-rodent cell hybrids, Van Cong et al. (1988)
independently assigned the C1r and C1s genes to chromosome 12. In situ
hybridization confirmed these assignments and localized the genes to
12p13.

In a study of 5 families heterozygous at both the C1R and the C1S locus,
Lyons et al. (1989) found evidence consistent with, but not proving,
linkage of the loci; maximum lod score = 1.505 at theta = 0.00.

By hybridization of C1r and C1s probes to restriction endonuclease
fragments of genomic DNA, Tosi et al. (1987) demonstrated close physical
linkage of the genes. This finding was consistent with their evolution
through tandem gene duplication and was also consistent with the
previously observed combined hereditary deficiencies of C1r and C1s (see
216950). Their coordinate expression may depend on the close linkage.
The 2 genes lie in a DNA stretch not longer than 50 kb.

By DNA blotting and sequencing analyses of genomic DNA and of an
isolated genomic DNA clone, Kusumoto et al. (1988) showed that the C1r
and C1s genes are closely located in a 'tail-to-tail' arrangement at a
distance of about 9.5 kb.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Kamboh and Ferrell (1986) demonstrated genetic polymorphism of C1R using
the high-resolving power of isoelectric focusing in 6M urea followed by
immunoblotting. Kamboh et al. (1988) described a new allele by
isoelectric focusing and immunoblotting. Using the same methods, Kamboh
et al. (1989) described 5 new alleles.

Data on gene frequencies of allelic variants were tabulated by
Roychoudhury and Nei (1988).

609146	TITLE *609146 RIC8, C. ELEGANS, HOMOLOG OF, A; RIC8A
;;SYNEMBRYN, C. ELEGANS, HOMOLOG OF, A
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using G-alpha proteins (see GNAS; 139320) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid
screen of a rat brain cDNA library, Tall et al. (2003) cloned Ric8a, a
homolog of C. elegans Ric8/synembryn. Database analysis identified 3
splice variants of human RIC8A that encode deduced proteins of 531, 537,
and 401 amino acids. The 531-amino acid RIC8A isoform shares 87%
identity with rat Ric8a. The 537-amino acid protein is identical to the
531-amino acid protein except for a 6-amino acid insertion, including a
polyproline sequence, at codon 355. The variant encoding the 401-amino
acid protein is derived from a 1-bp insertion at codon 395 of the
transcript encoding the 531-amino acid protein. The resultant frameshift
leads to a protein with 5 different C-terminal amino acids and a new
stop codon that forms a consensus CAAX box for geranylgeranyl
modification.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Tall et al. (2003) found that rat Ric8a
interacted with GNAI1 (139310), GNAO (139311), GNAQ (600998), and weakly
with GNA13 (604406). No interaction was observed with GNAS. Ric8a
interacted preferentially with wildtype GNAI1 compared with its
GTPase-defective counterpart. In detergent extracts of rat brain
membranes, Ric8a interacted with GNAI1, GNAI2 (139360), GNAI3 (139370),
GNAQ, and GNA13, but not with GNAS or G protein beta subunits (see GNB1;
139380). Tall et al. (2003) found that Ric8a preferentially interacted
with nucleotide-free GNAI1. Ric8a stimulated the rate of binding between
a nonhydrolyzable GTP analog and GNAQ, and it stimulated the
steady-state GTPase activity of GNAQ. However, Ric8a did not interact
with preformed G protein heterotrimers or facilitate their nucleotide
exchange. Beta-gamma dimers appeared to compete with Ric8a for binding
to G-alpha proteins.

Afshar et al. (2004) determined that C. elegans Ric8 is required for
proper asymmetric division of 1-cell-stage embryos. Spindle severing
experiments demonstrated that Ric8 was required for the generation of
substantial pulling forces on astral microtubules. Ric8 physically
interacted with 2 nematode G-alpha subunits that act in a partially
redundant manner in 1-cell-stage embryos. Ric8 behaved as a guanine
nucleotide exchange factor for the G-alpha protein Goa1.

GENE STRUCTURE

Tall et al. (2003) determined that the RIC8A gene contains at least 7
exons.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the RIC8A
gene to chromosome 11 (TMAP WI-19967).

602364	TITLE *602364 CATHEPSIN W; CTSW
DESCRIPTION Cathepsins are papain family cysteine proteases involved in a variety of
physiologic processes, such as proenzyme activation, enzyme
inactivation, antigen presentation, hormone maturation, tissue
remodeling, and bone matrix resorption. Cathepsins are glycoproteins and
contain an essential cysteine residue in their active site but differ in
some enzymatic properties, including substrate specificities and pH
stability. Cathepsins H (116820), L (116880), B (116810), and C (602365)
have ubiquitous expression and may have 'housekeeping' roles (Linnevers
et al. (1997)). In contrast, cathepsins S (116845) and W have
tissue-restricted expression and may have more specific functions.

Linnevers et al. (1997) identified a novel cathepsin in the GenBank
expressed sequence tag (EST) database. The cDNA clone encodes a
376-amino acid polypeptide with a predicted mass of 42 kD. Sequence
similarity with other thiol-dependent cathepsins at the amino acid level
is relatively low, in the range of 21 to 31%. Linnevers et al. (1997)
stated that all of the highly conserved residues of the papain-like
cysteine proteases are present in cathepsin W. In contrast to other
mammalian cathepsin sequences, cathepsin W contains a 21-amino acid
insertion between the active-site histidine and asparagine residues, and
an 8-amino acid C-terminal extension. Northern blot analysis detected
cathepsin W expression only in lymphatic tissues, with high expression
in cytotoxic (CD8+) T lymphocytes.

Wex et al. (1998) cloned the cathepsin W gene. The coding sequence is
contained within 10 exons spanning approximately 3.8 kb. At least 1
additional exon contains the 5-prime untranslated region. The authors
overexpressed cathepsin W in mammalian cells and unexpectedly localized
it within the rough endoplasmic reticulum.

By FISH, Wex et al. (1998) mapped the cathepsin W gene to 11q13.1.

605391	TITLE *605391 MULTIPLE INOSITOL POLYPHOSPHATE PHOSPHATASE 1; MINPP1
;;MIPP, RAT, HOMOLOG OF;;
HIPER1, CHICKEN, HOMOLOG OF
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MINPP1 hydrolyzes the abundant metabolites inositol pentakisphosphate
and inositol hexakisphosphate and, like PTEN (601728), has the ability
to remove 3-phosphate from inositol phosphate substrates.

CLONING

In addition to inositol triphosphate, an important second messenger in
eukaryotic cells, there are a number of inositol polyphosphates, as well
as enzymes that affect their metabolism, that play a role in signaling
activity. The rat enzyme Mipp removes polyphosphate groups from a number
of inositol polyphosphates that contain at least 4 phosphates. The chick
gene HiPER1 (histidine phosphatase of the endoplasmic reticulum), a
homolog of Mipp, is expressed strongly in growth plate chondrocytes
transiting from proliferation to hypertrophy. By searching an EST
database with rat Mipp as the probe, Caffrey et al. (1999) identified a
cDNA encoding human MINPP1, which they called MIPP. Sequence analysis
predicted that the 487-amino acid MINPP1 protein is 84% identical to rat
Mipp and about 53% identical to chick HiPER1. The N terminus of MINPP1
contains an ER-targeting domain consisting of a relatively long
net-positive-charge (n) region, a hydrophobic core region, and a
recognition site for signal peptidases. Because of the
13-amino-acid-long n region, Caffrey et al. (1999) suggested that
translocation of MINPP1 to the ER may not require TRAM (605190), which
is needed for proteins with short (5 residues or less) n regions. MINPP1
catalytic activity appears to require sequences in the C terminus.
Western blot analysis demonstrated that MINPP1 is expressed as an
approximately 51-kD protein. Northern blot analysis detected a 2.5-kb
MINPP1 transcript in all tissues tested except for peripheral blood
leukocytes; highest expression was detected in kidney, liver, and
placenta. In situ hybridization analysis showed that Minpp1 is expressed
much more intensely in hypertrophic than in proliferating or resting rat
chondrocytes.

By RT-PCR, RACE, and library screening, Chi et al. (1999) identified a
cDNA encoding MINPP1. Northern blot analysis detected a 2.6-kb MINPP1
transcript in HeLa cells and human chondrocytes. The authors noted that
the C-terminal ER-retention signal is conserved between chick, rat, and
human MINPP1 sequences. Functional analysis showed that mouse Minpp1
converts inositol tetrakisphosphate to inositol triphosphate.

MAPPING

Using FISH, radiation hybrid analysis, and YAC screening, Chi et al.
(1999) mapped the MINPP1 gene to 10q23, proximal to the tumor suppressor
PTEN (601728), in a region that is frequently mutated in cancer. By
radiation hybrid analysis, Chi et al. (1999) mapped the mouse Minpp1
gene to chromosome 19, also in proximity to Pten.

ANIMAL MODEL

Chi et al. (2000) used homologous recombination to generate
Minpp1-deficient mice. They observed that these mice were fertile,
lacked obvious defects, and had normal chondrocyte differentiation. An
increase in levels of cytosolic inositol polyphosphates was reversible
by the introduction of Minpp1 to the ER, showing that ER-based Minpp1
plays a role in the maintenance of steady-state levels of these
polyphosphates. In contrast, introduction into the cytosol of truncated
Minpp1 lacking the ER-targeting domain reduced the polyphosphates to
below their natural levels and was accompanied by slowed cellular
proliferation.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Germline mutations in the tumor suppressor gene PTEN, which encodes a
dual-specificity phosphatase, have been found in up to 80% of patients
with Cowden syndrome, suggesting a role of PTEN in the pathogenesis of
follicular thyroid tumors. Although somatic intragenic mutations in
PTEN, which maps to 10q23.3, are rarely found in follicular tumors, loss
of heterozygosity (LOH) of markers within 10q22-q24 occurs in about 25%.
MINPP1, another phosphatase gene, had also been mapped to 10q23.3.
MINPP1 has the ability to remove 3-phosphate from inositol phosphate
substrates, a function that overlaps that of PTEN. Because of this
overlapping function with PTEN and the physical location of MINPP1 to a
region with frequent LOH in follicular thyroid tumors, Gimm et al.
(2001) considered it to be an excellent candidate gene that could
contribute to the pathogenesis of follicular thyroid tumors. They
analyzed DNA from tumor and corresponding normal tissue from 23 patients
with follicular thyroid adenoma (FA) and 15 patients with follicular
thyroid carcinoma (FTC; 188470) for LOH or mutations at the MINPP1
locus. LOH was identified in 4 malignant and 3 benign tumors. One of
these FTCs with LOH was found to harbor a somatic ser41-to-leu mutation
(S41L; 605391.0001). They also found 2 germline sequence variants,
gln270 to arg (Q270R; 605391.0002) and IVS3+34T-A (605391.0003). Q270R
was found in only 1 patient with FA but not in patients with FTC or
normal controls. Interestingly, IVS3+34T-A was found in about 15% of FA
cases and normal controls but not in patients with FTC. The authors
concluded that these results suggest a role for MINPP1 in the
pathogenesis of at least a subset of malignant follicular thyroid
tumors, and that MINPP1 might act as a low penetrance predisposition
allele for FTC.

606918	TITLE *606918 GOLGI AUTOANTIGEN, GOLGIN SUBFAMILY A, 5; GOLGA5
;;GOLGIN 84;;
RET-FUSED GENE 5; RFG5
PTC5 CHIMERIC ONCOGENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Coiled-coil proteins on the Golgi surface are of the resident and
transient types. These proteins maintain Golgi structure and participate
in budding transport, tethering, and docking of vesicles. GOLGB1
(602500), for example, tethers coatamer complex I vesicles to the Golgi,
facilitating vesicle transport within the Golgi stack. GOLGA5 is another
coiled-coil protein on the Golgi surface.

CLONING

By screening a sigmoid colon cancer cDNA library, Ishizaka et al. (1989)
identified a cDNA encoding a RET (164761) fusion product that they
designated RET-II. The predicted RET-II fusion protein has 899 amino
acids. Northern blot analysis revealed expression of a 2.8-kb transcript
in various cell lines.

By RT-PCR screening of papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs; 188550) of 2
patients exposed to radioactive fallout after the Chernobyl nuclear
power plant disaster, followed by 5-prime RACE, Klugbauer et al. (1998)
identified a RET rearrangement, PTC5, involving fusion of the RET
tyrosine kinase domain to RFG5. The PTC5 rearrangement is identical to
RET-II. EST database analysis identified what the authors considered to
be the full-length RFG5 sequence. The predicted 585-amino acid RFG5
protein has 4 coiled-coil domains in its middle and C-terminal portions,
but no transmembrane domain. Northern blot analysis detected expression
of a 2.8-kb transcript in all tissues tested. Immunohistochemical
analysis showed stronger expression of the PTC5 fusion protein in
thyroid tumor cells compared with normal cells.

By yeast 2-hybrid screening of a brain cDNA library with OCRL1 (300535)
as the probe, Bascom et al. (1999) isolated a cDNA encoding GOLGA5,
which they called golgin-84. GOLGA5 is identical to RFG5. The deduced
731-amino acid coiled-coil, type II transmembrane protein has no signal
sequence and a cytoplasmic N terminus. Western blot analysis showed
expression of an 84-kD protein in fibroblast lysates, with greatest
abundance in mouse testis. Immunohistochemical analysis indicated
strongest expression in seminiferous tubules and Leydig cells in a
juxtanuclear Golgi localization. Double-label immunofluorescence
microscopy and brefeldin A treatment confirmed the Golgi localization.
Bascom et al. (1999) suggested that GOLGA5 plays a role in vesicle
tethering and docking.

GENE FUNCTION

Malsam et al. (2005) characterized the golgin-84-CASP (116896) tether.
The vesicles bound by this tether were strikingly different from those
bound by the p115 (603344)-golgin tether in that they lacked members of
the p24 family of putative cargo receptors and contained enzymes instead
of anterograde cargo. Microinjected golgin-84 or CASP also inhibited
Golgi-enzyme transport to the endoplasmic reticulum, further implicating
this tether in retrograde transport.

MAPPING

By database analysis, Bascom et al. (1999) mapped the GOLGA5 gene to
chromosome 14q.

608549	TITLE *608549 VACUOLAR PROTEIN SORTING 11, YEAST, HOMOLOG OF; VPS11
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

In yeast, Vps proteins are involved in the trafficking of endocytic and
biosynthetic proteins to the vacuole, which functionally resembles the
lysosome of higher organisms. Mutations in class C Vps proteins, which
includes Vps11, result in the most severe vacuolar protein sorting and
morphology defects (Huizing et al., 2001).

CLONING

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to yeast and
Drosophila Vps11, followed by 3-prime and 5-prime RACE, Huizing et al.
(2001) cloned VPS11. The deduced 941-amino acid protein has a calculated
molecular mass of 107.8 kD. VPS11 contains a clathrin repeat domain and
a RING-H2 finger domain, and it is likely a cytosolic protein. VPS11
shares 24% amino acid identity with yeast Vps11. ESTs sharing
significant identity were also identified in rat, bovine, chicken, and
frog databases. Northern blot analysis detected a 4.3-kb VPS11 mRNA in
all tissues examined, with highest expression in heart and pancreas and
lowest expression in lung. A weaker band of about 6.0 kb was also
detected in most tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

- Role of VPS11 in Ebola Virus Infection

Infections by the Ebola and Marburg filoviruses cause a rapidly fatal
hemorrhagic fever in humans for which no approved antivirals are
available. Filovirus entry is mediated by the viral spike glycoprotein
(GP), which attaches viral particles to the cell surface, delivers them
to endosomes, and catalyzes fusion between viral and endosomal
membranes. Additional host factors in the endosomal compartment are
likely required for viral membrane fusion. Using a replication-competent
vesicular stomatitis virus bearing Ebola virus GP (rVSV-GP-EboV) for a
genomewide haploid genetic screen in human cells, followed by selection
of rVSV-GP-EboV-resistant cells, Carette et al. (2011) confirmed a role
for cathepsin B (CTSB; 116810) and identified roles for NPC1 (607623)
and all 6 subunits of the HOPS complex, VPS11, VPS16 (608550), VPS18
(608551), VPS33A (610034), VPS39 (612188), and VPS41 (605485), in Ebola
virus entry. Subcloned cells lacking VPS11, VPS33A, or NPC1 displayed
marked resistance to rVSV-GP-EboV or Marburg virus-GP, and
susceptibility could be restored by expression of the corresponding
cDNAs. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated that cells lacking
NPC1, VPS11, or VPS33A had an altered distribution of virus within
cells. Carette et al. (2011) concluded that most of the genes involved
in filovirus entry are involved in lysosome function, indicating that
filoviruses exploit this organelle differently than other viruses.

MAPPING

Huizing et al. (2001) stated that the VPS11 gene maps to chromosome
11q23.

611379	TITLE *611379 DISCO-INTERACTING PROTEIN 2, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, B; DIP2B
;;KIAA1463
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned DIP2B, which they designated
KIAA1463. The transcript contains a repetitive element in its 3-prime
UTR. RT-PCR ELISA detected moderate expression in adult brain and in all
specific adult brain regions examined. Expression was weaker in adult
liver, kidney, spleen, and ovary, and in fetal brain and liver, with
little to no expression in all other tissues examined.

Winnepenninckx et al. (2007) identified DIP2B as the gene associated
with fragile site FRA12A (136630) on chromosome 12. The predicted
1,576-amino acid DIP2B protein contains a DMAP1 (DNMAP1; 605077)-binding
domain and 2 AMP-binding domains. Northern blot analysis detected a 9-kb
transcript in most tissues examined. Within specific brain regions,
highest expression was in cerebral cortex and frontal and parietal
lobes.

GENE STRUCTURE

Winnepenninckx et al. (2007) determined that the DIP2B gene contains 38
exons.

MAPPING

By FISH and genomic sequence analysis, Winnepenninckx et al. (2007)
mapped the DIP2B gene to chromosome 12q13.12.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 2 patients with mental retardation associated with FRA12A,
Winnepenninckx et al. (2007) identified a CGG repeat expansion in the
5-prime untranslated region of the DIP2B gene (611379.0001).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MENTAL RETARDATION, FRA12A TYPE
DIP2B, CGG(n) EXPANSION

In 2 patients with mental retardation associated with FRA12A (136630),
Winnepenninckx et al. (2007) identified a polymorphic CGG repeat
expansion in the 5-prime untranslated region of the DIP2B gene. The
length of the expanded allele in the affected individuals was greater
than 1,050 to 1,150 basepairs, whereas unaffected FRA12A family carriers
had 650 to 860 basepairs. In 7 individuals with significant
neurocognitive problems reported in the literature, the average level of
FRA12A expression in lymphocytes was 43.7%, whereas that in unaffected
carrier individuals was 16.6%. The percentage of cytogenetic expression
of FRA12A was thus associated with the clinical phenotype. DIP2B mRNA
levels were halved in 2 subjects with FRA12A with mental retardation in
whom the repeat expansion was methylated. In 2 individuals without
mental retardation but with an expanded and methylated repeat, DIP2B
expression was reduced to approximately two-thirds of the values
observed in controls. A carrier of an unmethylated CGG repeat expansion
showed increased levels of DIP2B mRNA, which suggested that the repeat
elongation increases gene expression.

601572	TITLE *601572 CAPPING PROTEIN, BETA; CAPZB
;;CAP PROTEIN, ACTIN, BETA; CAPPB
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

CapZ was identified in chicken as an actin-binding protein composed of
alpha (see 601580) and beta subunits. From a human retina cDNA library,
Barron-Casella et al. (1995) isolated cDNAs homologous for the beta
subunit of chicken CapZ.

MAPPING

Barron-Casella et al. (1995) mapped the CAPZB gene to chromosome 1p36.1
by fluorescence in situ hybridization.

HISTORY

In the course of mapping 39 ESTs on chromosome 6p24-p23, Olavesen et al.
(1997) concluded that CAPZB is located in that region flanked by EDN1
(131240) on the centromeric side and TFAP2 (107580) on the telomeric
side. However, Cooper (1999) stated that a 'simple clerical error'
occurred at the outset of this project; the EST in question does not
share sequence similarity with the CAPZB gene and, therefore, the
mapping of the CAPZB gene to chromosome 6p24-p23 is incorrect.

606238	TITLE *606238 IKAROS FAMILY ZINC FINGER 5; IKZF5
;;ZINC FINGER PROTEIN, SUBFAMILY 1A, MEMBER 5; ZNFN1A5;;
PEGASUS
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the Ikaros (ZNFN1A1; 603023) family of transcription factors,
which includes Pegasus, are expressed in lymphocytes and are implicated
in the control of lymphoid development.

CLONING

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen on an erythroleukemia cDNA library with
the C-terminal dimerization domain of Aiolos (606221) as bait, followed
by RT-PCR, Perdomo et al. (2000) isolated cDNAs encoding Eos (606239)
and Pegasus. Sequence analysis predicted that the Pegasus protein
contains 419 amino acids. Like the other Ikaros family members, Pegasus
has a conserved C-terminal zinc finger cluster. However, Pegasus has
little homology in its other regions to Ikaros family proteins, and it
has 3 divergent N-terminal zinc fingers rather than the 4 N-terminal
fingers conserved in the other members. GST pull-down experiments showed
that the C-terminal zinc fingers of Pegasus interact with other Ikaros
proteins and with Pegasus itself, establishing the presence of
functional dimerization domains. DNA binding analysis indicated that
Eos, but not Pegasus, interacts with high affinity with sequences
similar to those bound by Ikaros and other family members. Pegasus was
found to preferentially recognize GnnTGTnG rather than the tGGGAatacc
site recognized by other Ikaros family members. Reporter analysis
demonstrated that Pegasus acts as a transcriptional repressor at its
sites but not at Eos sites. Northern blot analysis revealed broad
expression of 3 Pegasus transcripts in hemopoietic cell lines and in

607089	TITLE *607089 CYCLIN D-TYPE-BINDING PROTEIN 1; CCNDBP1
;;GRAP2 CYCLIN-D-INTERACTING PROTEIN; GCIP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

In a yeast 2-hybrid screen with the C-terminal glu/pro-rich domain and
the SH3 domain (QC domain) of GRAP2 (604518) as bait, Xia et al. (2000)
cloned CCNDBP1, which they called GCIP, from a pretransformed human bone
marrow cDNA library. CCNDBP1 encodes a deduced 360-amino acid protein
with a calculated molecular mass of 40 kD. It is predicted to contain a
helix-loop-helix region without the basic DNA-binding domain, a central
acidic domain, and a leucine zipper motif. Northern blot analysis
detected a 1.3-kb transcript in all tissues examined, with highest
expression in heart, muscle, peripheral leukocytes, kidney, and brain.
RT-PCR revealed expression in all immune tissues, with relatively low
expression in bone marrow.

GENE FUNCTION

Xia et al. (2000) verified interaction between GCIP and the QC domain of
GRAP2 in yeast 2 hybrid assays, in in vitro binding assays, and by
Western blot analysis of immunoprecipitates of cotransfected COS-7
cells. GST pull-down assays of cell lysates from several cell lines and
coimmunoprecipitation of cyclin D with GCIP from GCIP-transfected cells
showed that GCIP also associates with cyclin D (CCND1; 168461).
Overexpression of GCIP in COS-7 cells reduced the phosphorylation of the
retinoblastoma protein (RB1; 614041) by immunopurified cyclin D/CDK4
(123829) complexes. GCIP expression also reduced the transcriptional
activity of a cotransfected E2F1 (189971) reporter plasmid.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the CCNDBP1
gene to chromosome 15 (TMAP WI16359).

613197	TITLE *613197 TRAF-TYPE ZINC FINGER DOMAIN-CONTAINING 1; TRAFD1
;;FLN29
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The innate immune system confers host defense against viral and
microbial infection, and TRAFD1 is a negative feedback regulator that
controls excessive immune responses (Sanada et al., 2008).

CLONING

Using microarray analysis to identify genes upregulated in mouse
macrophages by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), followed by RT-PCR of human
HEK293 cells and the mouse RAW macrophage line, Mashima et al. (2005)
cloned human and mouse TRAFD1, which they called FLN29. The deduced
human and mouse proteins contain 582 and 576 amino acids, respectively.
TRAFD1 has an N-terminal RING finger domain, followed by a zinc finger
domain, and TRAF-N and TRAF-C domains. Northern blot analysis of mouse
tissues showed expression skeletal muscle, brain, kidney, spleen, and
bone marrow.

GENE FUNCTION

Mashima et al. (2005) found that the expression of Fln29 was upregulated
in mouse RAW cells by LPS, IFN-beta (IFNB; 147640), and IFN-gamma (IFNG;
147570). Use of Stat1 (600555)-deficient mouse bone marrow-derived
macrophages and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) showed that Stat1 was
required for Fln29 upregulation by LPS and IFNB. Exogenous
overexpression of Fln29 in LPS-pretreated RAW cells resulted in the
suppression of TLR4 (603030)-mediated NF-kappa B (see 164011) and
activation of MAP kinase (see MAPK1, 176948). Small interfering
RNA-induced downregulation of Fln29 reversed these effects and increased
the production of nitrous oxide. Fln29 inhibited Toll-like receptor
(TLR) signaling by interacting directly with Traf6 (602355). Mashima et
al. (2005) concluded that FLN29 is activated by STAT1 and functions as a
negative feedback regulator of TLR signaling downstream of TRAF6.

By immunoprecipitation of transfected HEK293 cells, Sanada et al. (2008)
found that mouse Fln29 interacted with IPS1 (MAVS; 609676), TRIF
(TICAM1; 607601), TRAF1 (601711), TRAF2 (601895), and TRAF3 (601896).
Overexpression of mouse Fln29 inhibited IPS1-dependent IRF3 (603734)
activation.

MAPPING

Hartz (2009) mapped the TRAFD1 gene to chromosome 12q24.13 based on an
alignment of the TRAFD1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AB007447) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

ANIMAL MODEL

Sanada et al. (2008) found that Fln29 -/- mice were born at the expected
mendelian ratio and showed no gross developmental abnormalities.
However, they mounted an exaggerated response to LPS and to poly(I:C), a
synthetic double-stranded RNA that stimulates both the Toll-like
receptor and RIGI (DDX58; 609631)-like helicase (RLH) response pathways.
Bone marrow-derived dendritic cells from Fln29 -/- animals, but not
wildtype animals, showed augmented LPS-induced activation of Ikk (see
CHUK, 600664) and Jnk (see MAPK8, 601158). Mutant mice were
significantly more sensitive than wildtype mice to poly(I:C)-induced
septic shock. They suffered more severe hepatic damage and showed
elevated serum Il6 (147620) levels. Finally, Fln29 -/- MEFs were more
resistant to vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) cytopathic effects, with
lower virus titer than in wildtype MEFs due to reduced VSV replication.
Sanada et al. (2008) concluded that FLN29 is a negative regulator of
both TLR- and RLH-mediated innate immune responses.

124095	TITLE *124095 CYTOPLASMIC TYROSINE KINASE; CSK
;;c-SRC TYROSINE KINASE
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Partanen et al. (1991) cloned a novel cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase
designated CSK. The CSK gene was ubiquitously expressed in human tissues
as 2 mRNA species of 2.6 and 3.4 kb, although in some tissues and cell
lines, only the larger mRNA was detected.

GENE FUNCTION

CSK downregulates tyrosine kinase activity of the SRC oncoprotein
(190090) through tyrosine phosphorylation of the SRC carboxy terminus.
Since cell transformation by SRC oncoproteins is caused by various
mechanisms that interfere with this phosphorylation, the CSK gene might
function as an antioncogene (Armstrong et al., 1992).

Cloutier and Veillette (1996) used the yeast 2-hybrid system to identify
proteins associated with CSK. They found that the Src homology-3 (SH3)
domain of CSK associates with a proline-rich region of PEP (600716), a
protein-tyrosine phosphatase expressed in hemopoietic cells. Cloutier
and Veillette (1996) showed that this association is highly specific and
speculated that PEP may be an effector and/or regulator of CSK in T
cells and other hemopoietic cells.

MAPPING

Armstrong et al. (1992) used in situ hybridization to map the CSK gene
to 15q23-q25.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Associations Pending Confirmation

CSK physically interacts with the intracellular phosphatase LYP (PTPN22;
600716) and can modify the activation state of downstream Src kinases,
such as LYN (165120), in lymphocytes. Manjarrez-Orduno et al. (2012)
identified an association of CSK with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE;
152700) and refined its location to the intronic polymorphism dbSNP
rs34933034 (odds ratio = 1.32; p = 1.04 x 10(-9)). The risk allele at
this SNP is associated with increased CSK expression and augments
inhibitory phosphorylation of LYN. In carriers of the risk allele, there
is increased B-cell receptor-mediated activation of mature B cells, as
well as higher concentrations of plasma IgM, relative to individuals in
the nonrisk haplotype. Moreover, the fraction of transitional B cells is
doubled in the cord blood of carriers of the risk allele, due to an
expansion of late transitional cells in a stage targeted by selection
mechanisms. Manjarrez-Orduno et al. (2012) concluded that their results
suggested that the LYP-CSK complex increases susceptibility to lupus at
multiple maturation and activation points in B cells.

ANIMAL MODEL

Lowry et al. (2002) found that actin stress fiber formation induced by G
proteins and G protein receptors was completely blocked in Csk-deficient
mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Reintroduction of Csk into Csk-deficient
cells restored G protein-induced actin stress fiber formation. Rescue
experiments with catalytic mutants of Csk demonstrated that Csk
catalytic activity was required for stress fiber formation. Lowry et al.
(2002) found that G-beta (see GNB1; 139380)/G-gamma (see GNG2; 606981)
dimers translocated Csk to the plasma membrane and directly increased
Csk kinase activity. They concluded that CSK plays a critical role in
mediating G protein signals in the reorganization of the actin
cytoskeleton.

;;SET8;;
PR/SET DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 7; PR/SET7;;
PR/SET07;;
HISTONE H4-LYSINE 20-SPECIFIC METHYLTRANSFERASE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SETD8 is a lysine methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.43) that predominantly
monomethylates lysine-20 (K20) of histone H4 (see 602822). Through its
methyltransferase activity, SETD8 influences transcriptional regulation,
heterochromatin formation, genomic stability, cell cycle progression,
and development (Yang et al., 2012).

CLONING

By purifying histone H4 lysine methyltransferase activity from HeLa cell
nuclear lysates, followed by peptide sequencing, database analysis, and
PCR of a HeLa cell cDNA library, Nishioka et al. (2002) cloned SETD8,
which they designated PR/SET7. The deduced 322-amino acid protein has a
C-terminal SET domain but lacks pre- and post-SET domains found in other
histone methyltransferases. Database analysis revealed orthologs of
SETD8 in worms, flies, and vertebrates, but not in lower eukaryotes.

Yang et al. (2012) showed that full-length SET8 contains 352 amino
acids; the SET domain encompasses amino acids 216 through 343.

MAPPING

Hartz (2013) mapped the SETD8 gene to chromosome 12q24.31 based on an
alignment of the SETD8 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF287261) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

GENE FUNCTION

Nishioka et al. (2002) showed that a mutation in Drosophila Pr/set7 was
lethal: second instar larval death coincided with the loss of H4-lys20
methylation, indicating a fundamental role for Pr/set7 in development.
Transcriptionally competent regions lacked H4-lys20 methylation, but the
modification coincided with condensed chromosomal regions on polytene
chromosomes, including chromocenter and euchromatic arms. The Drosophila
male X chromosome, which is hyperacetylated at H4-lys16, had
significantly decreased levels of lys20 methylation compared with that
of females. In vitro, methylation of lys20 and acetylation of lys16 on
the H4 tail were competitive. Taken together, these results supported
the hypothesis that methylation of H4-lys20 maintains silent chromatin,
in part, by precluding neighboring acetylation on the H4 tail.

Shi et al. (2007) showed that SET8 monomethylated p53 (TP53; 191170) in
human cell lines. This monomethylation suppressed p53-mediated
transcriptional activation of highly responsive target genes, such as
p21 (CDKN1A; 116899) and PUMA (BBC3; 605854), but it had little
influence on weak p53 targets. Depletion of SET8 augmented the
proapoptotic and checkpoint activation functions of p53, and SET8
expression was downregulated upon DNA damage.

Song et al. (2009) found evidence that expression of SET8 is regulated
by the microRNA MIR502 (300893; see MOLECULAR GENETICS).

Kudithipudi et al. (2012) synthesized peptides based on the SET8
recognition site surrounding monomethylated H4K20. They found that the
isolated SET domain of SET8 had a relatively long recognition sequence
covering 7 amino acids. SET8 methylated a number of the synthesized
peptides, suggesting that it could potentially methylate several
nonhistone proteins in addition to p53.

By immunoprecipitation analysis of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells, Yang
et al. (2012) found that SET8 interacts with TWIST (TWIST1; 601622), a
basic helix-loop-helix transcriptional factor that regulates
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Domain analysis revealed that
the N-terminal half of SET8 was required for the interaction. TWIST and
SET8 cooperated to promote EMT and metastasis in breast cancer cells
following implantation in mice. In knockdown and overexpression studies,
TWIST recruited SET8 to the promoter regions of E-cadherin (CDH1;
192090) and N-cadherin (CDH2; 114020), and histone H4K20 monomethylation
by SET8 resulted in downregulation of E-cadherin and upregulation of
N-cadherin.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Song et al. (2009) identified a SNP (dbSNP rs16917496C-T) in the SET8
miR502 (300893)-binding site that influenced SET8 expression. Breast
cancer tissues with the CC genotype, which represents the perfect
complementary seed sequence for miR502, had lower expression of SET8
mRNA than those with the TT genotype.

610454	TITLE *610454 LEUCINE ZIPPER, PUTATIVE TUMOR SUPPRESSOR 2; LZTS2
;;KIAA1813;;
LAPSER1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the LZTS protein family, such as LZTS2, are involved in
transcription modulation and cell cycle control (Peng et al., 2011).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2001) cloned LZTS2, which they designated
KIAA1813. The deduced protein contains 673 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA
detected high expression in all adult and fetal tissues and specific
adult brain regions examined.

By searching databases for sequences similar to LZTS1 (606551), followed
by RT-PCR of prostate and testis mRNA, Cabeza-Arvelaiz et al. (2001)
cloned full-length LZTS2 cDNA, which they called LAPSER1. The deduced
protein contains 669 or 644 amino acids depending upon which of 2
possible starting sites is used and has a calculated molecular mass of
72.8 or 70.3 kD, respectively. Using RT-PCR analysis Cabeza-Arvelaiz et
al. (2001) identified alternatively spliced transcripts of 2.0, 1.7, and
1.35 kb. The 2.0-kb transcript contained the expected sequence from all
coding exons; transcripts of 1.7 kb and 1.35 kb lacked exon 4 and exon
3, respectively. Northern blot analysis using an LZTS2 exon 3 probe
detected a 2.8-kb transcript in all tissues examined, with highest
expression in prostate and testis, followed by spleen, small intestine,
uterus, and thymus, and lowest expression in peripheral blood
lymphocytes. A minor 3.8-kb transcript detected may contain additional
5-prime noncoding sequence. Northern blot analysis using the complete
cDNA detected multiple LZTS2 isoforms in normal tissues, consistent with
alternative splicing, and LZTS2 expression was absent in some prostate
cancer cell lines, while in other prostate cancer cells lines the ratio
of major to minor transcripts was significantly altered.

GENE FUNCTION

By transfection of LZTS2 into a variety of human and rat cancer cell
lines, Cabeza-Arvelaiz et al. (2001) showed that cancer cell lines
overexpressing LZTS2 exhibited reduced cell growth. The authors
concluded that LZTS2 may inhibit cell growth in a variety of cancer
cells and may function as a tumor suppressor.

Sudo and Maru (2008) showed that rat Lapser1 interacted with the
microtubule-severing heterodimer p80 (KATNB1; 602703)/p60 (KATNA1;
606696) katanin via a Lapser1-binding region in the p80 subunit. Lapser1
localized to the mother centriole independent of microtubules.
Overexpression of Lapser1 in mitotic cells inhibited katanin-mediated
microtubule release and delayed cytokinesis. Overexpression of Lapser1
in interphase cells was associated with enhanced acetylation of
microtubules and reduced cell migration. The Lapser1-katanin interaction
appeared to inhibit microtubule severing by reducing the affinity of
katanin heterodimers for microtubules. In primary rat neurons, Lapser1
colocalized with katanin in noncentrosomal compartments, including cell
bodies and branch points at the tips of axonal branches. Lapser1
overexpression in neurons resulted in defects in neurite outgrowth and
reduced axonal microtubule bundles.

GENE STRUCTURE

Cabeza-Arvelaiz et al. (2001) determined that the LZTS2 gene contains at
least 5 exons and spans at least 10.6 kb. There are 2 possible noncoding
sequences, exon 1a and 1b, that are represented in different ESTs as a
result of alternate splicing in the 5-prime region.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Cabeza-Arvelaiz et al. (2001) mapped the
LZTS2 gene to chromosome 10q24.3 between the PTEN (601728) and MXI1
(600020) genes.

ANIMAL MODEL

Peng et al. (2011) obtained Lzts2 -/- mice at the expected mendelian
ratio. Lzts2 -/- mice showed obvious defects in kidney and urinary
tract, but not in any other tissue. Renal abnormalities in Lzts2 -/-
mice became apparent beginning at embryonic day 17.5, with ectopic
ureteric buds, renal/ureteral duplication, hydroureter/hydronephrosis,
and cystic dysplasia. Microscopic examination of Lzts2 -/- kidneys
revealed abnormal histologic organization, including tubular dilation,
cysts derived predominantly from collecting ducts, and lack of
glomerular structures. Lzts2 -/- kidneys and embryonic fibroblasts
showed altered subcellular localization of beta-catenin (CTNNB1; 116806)
and elevated nuclear beta-catenin activity compared with wildtype mice.
Peng et al. (2011) concluded that LZTS2 is essential for
beta-catenin-mediated nephrogenesis.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

DNAJB4 belongs to the evolutionarily conserved DNAJ/HSP40 protein
family. For background information on the DNAJ family, see 608375.

CLONING

Using the G protein beta subunit (GNB1; 139380) as bait in a yeast
2-hybrid screen of a liver cDNA library, Hoe et al. (1998) cloned
DNAJB4, which they called HLJ1. The deduced 337-amino acid protein
contains an N-terminal J domain and a glycine and phenylalanine
(G/F)-rich region. It shares 84% sequence similarity with DNAJB1
(604572). Northern blot analysis detected high expression in skeletal
muscle, heart, and pancreas, and lower expression in brain, placenta,
and liver.

GENE FUNCTION

By Northern blot analysis, Hoe et al. (1998) demonstrated that the
expression of DNAJB4 increased following heat-shock treatment in human
liver and pancreas carcinoma cell lines.

MAPPING

Hartz (2007) mapped the DNAJB4 gene to chromosome 1p31.1 based on an
alignment of the DNAJB4 sequence (GenBank GENBANK U40992) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.1).

associates with large ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes designated
'vaults' due to their unique structural characteristics.

CLONING

By randomly sequencing clones obtained from a myeloid cell line cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1996) cloned a partial cDNA of ADPRTL1, which
they designated KIAA0177. Northern blot analysis revealed ubiquitous
expression, with highest levels detected in heart, lung, kidney, and
peripheral blood leukocytes.

Using an N-terminally truncated rat major vault protein (MVP; 605088) as
bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen, followed by 5-prime RACE, Kickhoefer et
al. (1999) cloned ADPRTL1, which they designated VPARP, from a HeLa cell
cDNA library. The deduced 1,724-amino acid protein has a calculated
molecular mass of about 193 kD. ADPRTL1 has an N-terminal BRCA1 (113705)
C terminus (BRCT) domain, a PARP (ADPRT; 173870)-like catalytic domain,
a domain with 2 sequences similar to inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor (see
147270), and a C-terminal MVP-interacting domain. The BRCT domain may be
involved in protein-protein interaction and is found in proteins
involved in cell cycle checkpoint DNA damage response. The putative
catalytic domain shares 29% identity with the catalytic subunit of PARP
and contains a conserved NAD-binding pocket. Northern blot analysis
revealed a 5.4-kb transcript in all tissues examined except brain.
Highest expression was detected in kidney, followed by spleen and liver.
Western blot analysis of fractionated HeLa cells detected a 193-kD
protein evenly distributed between nuclear, cytosolic, and microsomal
fractions. All of the ADPRTL1 protein in the microsomal fraction was
associated with the vault particle. Immunofluorescence localization of
ADPRTL1 in HeLa cells showed a punctate cytoplasmic distribution that
colocalized with MVP. There were also nuclear ADPRTL1 puncta that were
not associated with MVP and a portion of ADPRTL1 that colocalized with
beta-tubulin (191130) along mitotic spindles in dividing cells.

Still et al. (1999) obtained a partial ADPRTL1 clone and generated the
full-length cDNA by 5-prime RACE of a brain cDNA library and by
screening a thymus cDNA library. Sequence analysis revealed that the
N-terminal side of the catalytic domain is rich in glutamic acids, which
may serve as automodification sites. ADPRTL1 contains no bipartite
nuclear localization signal or N-terminal zinc finger domain required
for DNA binding. It has a potential uncleavable N-terminal signal
peptide, a central putative transmembrane domain, and a potential SH3
ligand-binding motif in its C-terminal region.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis and by in vitro binding assays with
recombinant proteins, Kickhoefer et al. (1999) confirmed direct
interaction between ADPRTL1 and MVP. The C-terminal domain, residues
1562 to 1724, was the smallest sequence of ADPRTL1 that could bind MVP.
The PARP-like catalytic domain, when expressed as a recombinant protein
in E. coli, showed ADP-ribosylase activity. Vault particles purified
from rat liver and incubated with radiolabeled NAD showed prominent
ADP-ribosylation of Mvp and some automodification of Adprtl1.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Still et al. (1999) mapped the ADPRTL1
gene centromeric to the ZNF198 gene (602221) on chromosome 13q11.

603955	TITLE *603955 FLAVIN-CONTAINING MONOOXYGENASE 2; FMO2
;;FMO, PULMONARY
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The flavin-containing monooxygenases (EC 1.14.13.8) are NADPH-dependent
flavoenzymes that catalyze the oxidation of heteroatom centers in
numerous drugs and xenobiotics. Human FMO2 is expressed in lung and is
present in 2 isoforms. The most common isoform, FMO2*2A, contains a
premature stop codon encoding a truncated, inactive protein. The other,
full-length isoform, FMO2*1, is functional and has been found in African
Americans and Hispanic populations (Krueger et al., 2002; Krueger et
al., 2004).

CLONING

By screening a human lung cDNA library with rabbit FMO2 cDNA, Phillips
et al. (1995) cloned the FMO2 gene. The predicted 535-amino acid protein
has a molecular mass of 60,903 Da. Northern blot analysis detected FMO2
mRNA predominantly in adult lung.

By screening a human lung cDNA library with a rabbit FMO2 cDNA, Dolphin
et al. (1998) isolated human FMO2. Two transcripts were identified: a
minor transcript encoding a deduced 535-amino acid protein, and a major
transcript containing a premature stop at codon 472, resulting in a
truncated protein that is 64 residues shorter than the FMO2 proteins of
other mammals such as rabbit, guinea pig, and macaque monkey. RNase
protection assays indicated that the human FMO2 gene was expressed in
fetal, and predominantly adult, lung. However, Dolphin et al. (1998)
noted that a previous study had shown that FMO2 protein was undetectable
by Western blot analysis in all but 1 of 29 human lung samples (Williams
et al., 1990).

MAPPING

By PCR analysis of somatic cell hybrids, McCombie et al. (1996) mapped
the FMO2 gene to 1q, a region containing the FMO1 (136130), FMO3
(136132), and FMO4 (136131) genes.

GENE FUNCTION

Whetstine et al. (2000) analyzed the frequency and function of 2 human
FMO2 point mutations: 1414C-T that results in a truncated, inactive
protein, and 1589insT that results in a frameshift and disrupts the C
terminus of the protein. Whetstine et al. (2000) found that while 100%
of Caucasians and Koreans studied were homozygous for the 1414T allele
(FMO2*2A), the African American population studied exhibited a 13%
frequency of the 1414C allele (FMO2*1). The 1589insT allele occurred at
low frequencies in all populations and appeared to segregate with the
1414T allele and would thus have no further impact on FMO2 activity. By
Western blot analysis of lung microsomes, Whetstine et al. (2000) found
detectable FMO2 protein in 2 FMO2*1 heterozygotes.

Krueger et al. (2002) confirmed the presence of FMO2*1 in lung tissue
from a heterozygous (FMO2*1/FMO2*2A) individual by Western blot analysis
and confirmed activity by S-oxygenation. The microsomes also
demonstrated a heat-associated loss of activity similar to expressed
FMO2*1. This heat sensitivity may partially explain why activity in
postmortem human lung samples had been difficult to ascertain.

POPULATION GENETICS

Krueger et al. (2004) noted that the 1414C-T polymorphism exhibits
significant interethnic differences in allelic frequency. The functional
1414C allele (FMO2*1) has been found only in African American and
Hispanic populations. They stated that 26% of African Americans possess
the 1414C allele, and estimated the occurrence of FMO2*1 among Hispanics
of all origins to be between 2 and 7%.

EVOLUTION

The nonsense mutation (1441C-T; Q472X) described by Dolphin et al.
(1998) that leads to production of the truncated human protein is not
present in the FMO2 gene of closely related primates, and must therefore
have arisen in the human lineage after the divergence of humans from
their closest relative, the chimpanzee. Dolphin et al. (1998) suggested
that the truncated human FMO2 protein is unable to fold correctly and is
rapidly degraded. Heterologous expression studies demonstrated that
human FMO2*2A is catalytically inactive. Thus, this situation is similar
to those of the urate oxidase (UOX; 191540), gulonolactone oxidase
(GULOP; 240400), and cytidine monophospho-n-acetylneuraminic acid
hydroxylase (CMAH; 603209) gene products, which are active in most
mammals but are nonfunctional in the human.

104230	TITLE *104230 FUCOSYLTRANSFERASE 4; FUT4
;;ALPHA-3-FUCOSYLTRANSFERASE; FCT3A
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

In human/mouse myeloid cell hybrids, Geurts van Kessel et al. (1984)
tested for reactivity with monoclonal antibodies with known myelocytic,
monocytic, or myelomonocytic specificity. Twenty antibodies, all of
which bound specifically to the surface of human myeloid cells,
exhibited similar reactivity patterns with the hybrid clones.
Chromosomal analysis showed that the gene or genes involved in
expression of the 1 or more antigens recognized by these antibodies must
be located on human chromosome 11q12-qter. This myeloid-associated
surface antigen was designated CD15 in the CD system.

Tetteroo et al. (1987) found that alpha-3-fucosyltransferase activity
correlated with the presence of human chromosome 11 in human-mouse
myeloid cell hybrids. Also, several other myeloid-associated
carbohydrate antigens, e.g., LeX (CD15), were associated with chromosome
11. Tetteroo et al. (1987) concluded that an alpha-3-fucosyltransferase
gene on chromosome 11 is responsible for synthesis of these antigens.

Couillin et al. (1991) identified an alpha-3-fucosyltransferase on
chromosome 11q, FUT4, that transferred fucose onto H type 2 more
efficiently than onto sialyl-N-acetyllactosamine, suggesting that it is
the myeloid type of alpha-3-fucosyltransferase that makes the
3-fucosyllactosamine epitope (CD15) on polymorphonuclear cells and
monocytes.

Of the fucosyltranstransferases examined by Cailleau-Thomas et al.
(2000), only FUT4 and FUT9 (606865) were expressed during human
embryogenesis; all of the others showed irregular or weak expression. By
Northern blot analysis of 40- to 70-day-old embryos, they found
increasing expression of 6-, 3-, and 2.3-kb FUT4 transcripts. Analysis
of fetal tissues revealed abundant expression in liver, muscle, kidney,
skin, and small intestine, and moderate expression in brain, lung, and
heart. The transcript size varied in different tissues. In adult
tissues, highest expression was found in lung and small intestine, low
expression in kidney, liver, and brain, and no expression in 12 other
tissues tested.

GENE FUNCTION

Nakayama et al. (2001) showed that FUT9 directs CD15 synthesis in
lymphoid cells and mature granulocytes, whereas FUT4 directs CD15
synthesis in promyelocytes and monocytes. FUT9 exhibited stronger
activity for CD15 synthesis than FUT4.

MAPPING

Using human/mouse hybrid cell lines, Couillin et al. (1991) mapped a
human alpha-3-fucosyltransferase, FUT4, to chromosome 11q. Using panels
of somatic cell and radiation hybrids which retained different
rearrangements of chromosome 11, Reguigne et al. (1994) assigned the
FUT4 gene to chromosome 11q21, between D11S388 and D11S919. Using
fluorescence in situ hybridization and a cosmid containing FUT4
sequence, McCurley et al. (1995) confirmed the assignment of the FUT4
gene to chromosome 11q21.

Gersten et al. (1995) demonstrated that the mouse Fut4 gene maps to
chromosome 9 in a region showing syntenic homology with human 11q.

613846	TITLE *613846 TECTONIC FAMILY, MEMBER 2; TCTN2
;;TECTONIC 2; TECT2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching databases for sequences similar to TCTN1 (609863), Reiter
and Skarnes (2006) identified mouse and human TCTN2 and TCTN3 (613847).
The deduced mouse Tctn2 protein contains 700 amino acids. It has an
N-terminal signal peptide and a C-terminal transmembrane domain that is
conserved in Drosophila tectonic.

MAPPING

Hartz (2011) mapped the TCTN2 gene to chromosome 12q24.31 based on an
alignment of the TCTN2 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK023037) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

GENE FUNCTION

Shaheen et al. (2011) performed RT-PCR to quantitate expression of Tctn2
in various mouse adult tissues. Tctn2 expression was identified in all
tissues, with significant expression in brain, kidney, and eye, organs
affected by the MKS phenotype. Studies of developmental expression in
the mouse detected significant expression at embryonic day 8.5 in the
neural tube, most notably in the rhombomere of the future hindbrain. By
embryonic day 10.5, Tctn2 mRNA was found throughout the mouse brain, the
length of the neural tube, and the growing edge of the limb buds, heart,
and eye. Furthermore, strong Tctn2 expression was observed in kidney
from embryonic day 14.5 mouse embryo.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Shaheen et al. (2011) identified homozygosity for a splice site mutation
in the TCTN2 gene (613846.0001) in a family segregating Meckel-Gruber
syndrome-8 (MKS8; 613885).

ANIMAL MODEL

Garcia-Gonzalo et al. (2011) found that Tctn2-null mouse embryos lacked
nodal cilia, and that cilia in neural tubes were scarce and
morphologically defective and failed to elongate axonemes. However,
basal bodies docked normally to the plasma membrane. Cilia numbers were
reduced in the limb bud mesenchyme, but cilia appeared normal. The
findings were similar to those of Tctn1 (609863)-null mice, indicating a
common function, and showed that Tctn1 and Tctn2 affect ciliogenesis in
a tissue-specific manner. Garcia-Gonzalo et al. (2011) also demonstrated
that Tctn2 and Tctn1 interact with other proteins in a large complex
localized to the transition zone between the ciliary axoneme and the
basal body.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MECKEL SYNDROME, TYPE 8
TCTN2, IVS13, A-G, -2

In affected members of a consanguineous Arab family with Meckel-Gruber
syndrome (MKS8; 613885), Shaheen et al. (2011) identified homozygosity
for a splice site mutation in the TCTN2 gene at the -2 position of exon
14 (1506-2A-G) that disrupted splicing and created 2 aberrant
transcripts. The first transcript introduces 104 basepairs from intron
13-14 and would delete 196 original amino acids, introduce 2 novel amino
acids, and prematurely truncate the 697-amino acid protein at residue
504. The second transcript lacks exon 14 and would delete 195 original
amino acids, introduce 4 novel amino acids, and prematurely truncate the
protein at residue 507. The mutation segregated with the disease in the
family and was not observed in 192 ethnically matched controls.

606036	TITLE *606036 ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR NUCLEAR TRANSLOCATOR 2; ARNT2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT; 126110) is a
member of a novel transcription factor family consisting of a conserved
basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) structural motif contiguous with a PAS
domain. Members of this family include PER (see 602260), the aryl
hydrocarbon receptor (AHR; 600253), SIM1 (603128), and HIF1A (603348).

CLONING

Hirose et al. (1996) isolated a novel member of this family, which they
designated Arnt2, from a cDNA library of 11.5-day mouse embryos. The
deduced 712-amino acid protein contains a characteristic bHLH/PAS motif
in its N terminus and shares an overall sequence identity of 57% with
Arnt.

By screening randomly selected cDNAs corresponding to relatively long
transcripts from human brain, Nagase et al. (1997) identified ARNT2,
which they designated KIAA0307, encoding a 706-amino acid protein.

GENE FUNCTION

Hirose et al. (1996) determined that Arnt2 interacts with mouse AhR and
Sim as efficiently as Arnt and that the Arnt2-AhR complex recognizes and
specifically binds the xenobiotic responsive element (XRE) sequence. In
DNA transfection experiments, Arnt2 rescued XRE-driven reporter gene
activity in Arnt mutant cells. RNA blot analysis detected restricted
expression of Arnt2 in the brains and kidneys of adult mice, in contrast
to the ubiquitous expression of Arnt. In situ hybridization experiments
demonstrated expression of Arnt2 exclusively in the dorsal region of the
spinal cord and branchial arch-1, whereas Arnt expression was broadly
distributed in the ventral portion of the mesodermal and endodermal
tissues.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1997) mapped the ARNT2 gene
to chromosome 15. The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium
mapped the gene to 15q24 (TMAP stSG35499).

ANIMAL MODEL

To assess the role of ARNT2 in development and determine functional
overlap with ARNT, Keith et al. (2001) generated a targeted null
mutation of the murine Arnt2 locus. Arnt2 -/- embryos died perinatally
and exhibited impaired hypothalamic development, phenotypes previously
observed for a targeted mutation in the murine Sim1 gene and consistent
with the proposal by Michaud et al. (2000) that Arnt2 and Sim1 form an
essential heterodimer in vivo. In addition, cultured Arnt2 -/- neurons
displayed decreased hypoxic induction of HIF1A target genes,
demonstrating formally that ARNT2/HIF1A complexes regulate
oxygen-responsive genes. Finally, a strong genetic interaction between
Arnt and Arnt2 mutations was observed, indicating that either gene can
fulfill essential functions in a dose-dependent manner before embryonic
day 8.5. These results demonstrated that Arnt and Arnt2 have both unique
and overlapping essential functions in embryonic development.

608684	TITLE *608684 NINEIN; NIN
;;GSK3B-INTERACTING PROTEIN;;
KIAA1565
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Ninein is a centrosomal protein required for the centrosome to function
as a microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) and is essential for the
reformation of the interphase centrosome architecture following mitosis
(Ou et al., 2002).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned NIN, which they designated
KIAA1565. RT-PCR ELISA detected high NIN expression in ovary, spleen,
adult whole brain, and all individual brain regions examined. Expression
was intermediate in all other adult and fetal tissues examined except
testis, which showed no expression.

Using GSK3B (605004) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a fetal liver
cDNA library, followed by EST contig searching and 5-prime RACE of fetal
liver cDNA, Hong et al. (2000) cloned full-length NIN. The deduced
2,047-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 239 kD. NIN
contains an N-terminal GTP-binding site, a large coiled-coil domain with
4 leucine zipper motifs, and a C-terminal domain responsible for GSK
binding. Unlike mouse Nin, it does not have an N-terminal Ca(2+)-binding
site. Northern blot analysis detected a 9.0-kb transcript in all tissues
examined and a 7.0-kb transcript predominantly in heart and skeletal
muscle. Fluorescence-labeled NIN localized in the perinuclear foci
characteristic of centrosomes in transfected COS-1 cells.

Hong et al. (2000) cloned a splice variant of NIN, which they designated
ninein-lm (ninein like mouse) because the protein contains an N-terminal
Ca(2+)-binding site. This variant lacks intron 1 and utilizes an
alternate splice site in exon 2 that results in more 5-prime sequence of
exon 2. Ninein-lm encodes a deduced 2,041-amino acid protein with a
calculated molecular mass of 238 kD. RT-PCR and Southern blot analysis
indicated that ninein-lm expression was 20- to 50-fold higher than
ninein expression in all tissues tested except pancreas.

By Western blot analysis, Chen et al. (2003) determined that endogenous
HeLa cell ninein had an apparent molecular mass of about 230 kD.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hong et al. (2000) determined that the NIN gene contains 29 exons and
spans about 130 kb. The promoter region contains a TATA box, 2 CCAAT
boxes, and 3 GC boxes. It also has 4 Sp1 (189906)-binding sites, 2 p300
(602700)-binding sites, and 1 AP1 (165160)-binding site.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis and radiation hybrid analysis, Hong et al.
(2000) mapped the NIN gene to chromosome 14q22.

GENE FUNCTION

Hong et al. (2000) determined that the C termini of ninein and ninein-lm
bound GSK3B. The coiled-coil domain, but not the leucine-zipper domains,
mediated the interaction. The coiled-coil domain also mediated
oligomerization.

The mammalian centrosome consists of a pair of centrioles surrounded by
pericentriolar material (PCM). Ou et al. (2002) stated that a subset of
PCM proteins are arranged in a tubular conformation with an open and a
closed end within the centrosome. They found that, in the mother
centrosome, ninein and CEP110 (605496) were distributed at both ends of
the centrosome tube, including the site of centrosome duplication.
However, in the daughter centrosome, ninein and CEP110 were present only
at the closed end, where they colocalized with CEP250. The appearance of
ninein and CEP110 at the open end of the daughter centrosome occurred
during the telophase-G1 transition of the next cell cycle, concomitant
with the maturation of the daughter centrosome into a mother centrosome.
Microinjection of antibodies against either ninein or CEP110 into
metaphase HeLa cells disrupted the reformation of the tubular
conformation of proteins within the centrosome following cell division
and led to dispersal of centrosomal material throughout the cytosol.
Microinjection of antibodies to either ninein or CEP110 into metaphase
kangaroo rat kidney cells not only disrupted the tubular configuration
within the centrosome, but also affected the centrosome's ability to
function as an MTOC. Centrosomal architecture was not disrupted if
antibodies were microinjected into postmitotic cells with fully formed
centrosomes, but the MTOC function of the centrosomes was disrupted.

Chen et al. (2003) showed that the coiled-coil II (CCII) domain of
ninein, which contains a centrosome targeting signal, colocalized with
gamma-tubulin (191135) and centrin (see CENT1 603187) at the centrosome
of transfected HeLa cells. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that
ninein protein disappeared from spindle poles during metaphase and
anaphase, but reaccumulated at centrosomes at the end of cell division.
In vitro kinase assays indicated that the CCII domain was readily
phosphorylated by AIK (AURKA; 603072) and PKA (see 176911).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 2 sisters with severe short stature, microcephaly, and developmental
delay (Seckel syndrome-7; SCKL7, 614851), Dauber et al. (2012)
identified compound heterozygosity for missense mutations in the NIN
gene, Q1222R (608684.0001) and N1709S (608684.0002).

ANIMAL MODEL

Dauber et al. (2012) performed morpholino knockdown of ninein in
zebrafish and observed defects in the anterior neuroectoderm that
resulted in a deformity of the developing cranium, with a small, squared
skull highly reminiscent of the human phenotype.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
SECKEL SYNDROME 7
NIN, GLN1222ARG

In 2 sisters with severe short stature, microcephaly, and developmental
delay (SCKL7; 614851), Dauber et al. (2012) identified compound
heterozygosity for a 3667G-A transition in exon 18 of the NIN gene,
resulting in a gln1222-to-arg (Q1222R) substitution, and a 5128A-G
transition in exon 23, resulting in an asn1709-to-ser (N1709S;
608684.0002) substitution; both substitutions occurred at evolutionarily
conserved residues. The unaffected parents were each heterozygous for 1
of the mutations, neither of which was present in the SNP database or
the NHLBI exome variant server; however, the Q1222R variant was present
in the 1000 Genomes pilot data, with an overall minor allele frequency
of 0.001. Functional analysis of patient fibroblasts suggested that the
compound heterozygous NIN defects did not disrupt ninein expression or
localization or affect mitotic functions in an obvious way.
