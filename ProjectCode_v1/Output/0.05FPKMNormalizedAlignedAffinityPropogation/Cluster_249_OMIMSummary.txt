123812	TITLE *123812 cAMP RESPONSE ELEMENT MODULATOR; CREM
INDUCIBLE cAMP EARLY REPRESSOR, INCLUDED; ICER, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CREM is a multiexonic gene that encodes both activators and antagonists
of cAMP-inducible transcription by differential splicing. Splice
variants with antagonistic function lack 2 glutamine-rich domains and
block cAMP-induced transcription, whereas an isoform that includes these
glutamine-rich domains is a transcriptional activator (Molina et al.,
1993).

CLONING

From a mouse pituitary cDNA library, Foulkes et al. (1991) isolated a
protein highly homologous to nuclear factor CREB (123810), an activator
of cAMP-responsive promoter elements (CREs). Unlike CREB, which is
expressed uniformly in several cell types, the CREM gene showed
cell-specific expression. Downstream of the stop codon was a second
out-of-frame DNA-binding domain. Foulkes et al. (1991) identified 3 mRNA
isoforms that appeared to be formed through differential cell-specific
splicing. In contrast to CREB, CREM acts as a down-regulator of
cAMP-induced transcription.

Masquilier et al. (1993) showed conservation of CREM sequences in the
pig, chicken, lemur, and Xenopus. They cloned the full-length human CREM
cDNA sequence and demonstrated that it has a high degree of identity
with the mouse gene. They showed, furthermore, conservation of CREM
cyclic AMP transcriptional inducibility in humans.

Molina et al. (1993) identified a splice variant of CREM that is induced
by activation of the adenylyl cyclase signal transduction pathway. This
isoform, which they called 'inducible cAMP early repressor' (ICER), is
generated by induction of an internal promoter. Because ICER contains
the DNA-binding domain without the transactivation domain of other CREM
variants, it serves as a dominant-negative repressor of cAMP-induced
transcription.

GENE FUNCTION

Using EMSA analysis, Solomou et al. (2001) showed that while stimulated
T cells from normal individuals had increased binding of phosphorylated
CREB to the -180 site of the interleukin-2 (IL2; 147680) promoter,
nearly all stimulated T cells from systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE;
152700) patients had increased binding primarily of phosphorylated CREM
at this site and to the transcriptional coactivators CREBBP (600140) and
EP300 (602700). Increased expression of phosphorylated CREM correlated
with decreased production of IL2. Solomou et al. (2001) concluded that
transcriptional repression is responsible for the decreased production
of IL2 and anergy in SLE T cells.

ACT (FHL5; 605126) is expressed exclusively in round spermatids, where
it cooperates with transcriptional activator CREM in regulating various
postmeiotic genes. Targeted inactivation of CREM leads to a complete
block of mouse spermiogenesis. Macho et al. (2002) sought to identify
the regulatory steps controlling the functional interplay between CREM
and ACT. They found that ACT selectively associates with KIF17b (see
605037), a kinesin isoform highly expressed in male germ cells. The
ACT-KIF17b interaction is restricted to specific stages of
spermatogenesis and directly determines the intracellular localization
of ACT. Sensitivity to leptomycin B indicates that KIF17b can be
actively exported from the nucleus through the CRM1 receptor (602559).
Thus, Macho et al. (2002) concluded that a kinesin directly controls the
activity of a transcriptional coactivator by a tight regulation of its
intracellular localization.

Tomita et al. (2003) examined the expression and effects of ICER in
neonatal rat cardiac myocytes. They demonstrated that ICER is rapidly
upregulated by stimulation of the beta-adrenergic receptor in cardiac
myocytes and works as a negative regulator of hypertrophy as well as a
positive mediator of apoptosis.

MAPPING

By in situ hybridization, Masquilier et al. (1993) demonstrated that the
murine Crem gene is on chromosome 18; in the human, the gene was mapped
by in situ hybridization to 10p12.1-p11.1 with a peak of distribution in
the p11.2 band, and with a smaller secondary hybridization peak detected
on 2q34.

ANIMAL MODEL

Spermiogenesis is a complex process by which postmeiotic male germ cells
differentiate into mature spermatozoa. This process involves remarkable
structural and biochemical changes including nuclear DNA compaction and
acrosome formation. The transcriptional activator CREM is highly
expressed in postmeiotic cells and CREM may be responsible for the
activation of several haploid germ cell-specific genes involved in the
structuring of the spermatozoon. The specific role of CREM in
spermiogenesis was addressed by Nantel et al. (1996) using
CREM-deficient mice generated by homologous recombination. Analysis of
the seminiferous epithelium in mutant male mice revealed postmeiotic
arrest at the first step of spermiogenesis. Late spermatids were
completely absent, and there was a significant increase in apoptotic
germ cells. They showed that CREM deficiency results in the lack of
postmeiotic cell-specific gene expression. The complete lack of
spermatozoa in the mutant mice was reminiscent of cases of human
infertility. About one-third of infertile men fall into the category of
idiopathic infertility, i.e., they suffer from deficient spermatogenesis
even though gonadotropic and androgenic hormone secretion are not
subnormal.

Simultaneously and independently, Blendy et al. (1996) likewise observed
severe impairment of spermatogenesis in mice in whom the CREM gene had
been eliminated by gene targeting. Spermatids failed to differentiate
into sperm and postmeiotic gene expression in the testis declined
dramatically. The cessation of sperm development was not accompanied by
decreases in the levels of follicle-stimulating hormone or testosterone.

CLATHRIN ADAPTOR COMPLEX AP2, SIGMA SUBUNIT
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

AP17 is the 17-kD component of the AP2 clathrin-associated protein
complex (see 601024).

CLONING

Winterpacht et al. (1996) cloned the AP17 gene, CLAPS2, from a human
kidney cDNA library using the rat gene as a probe. The cDNA encodes a
predicted 142-amino acid protein that is 98% homologous to that of rat.
Holzmann et al. (1998) identified additional CLAPS2 cDNAs and found that
the predicted human and rat proteins are identical. They also isolated
cDNAs corresponding to an alternatively spliced CLAPS2 transcript
encoding AP17-delta, a protein variant lacking 38 amino acids of AP17.

By quantitative PCR analysis of AP2S1 expression using total RNA derived
from human, Nesbit et al. (2013) observed ubiquitous expression, with
expression in kidney and parathyroids similar to that in other tissues
except for brain, where higher expression was seen.

MAPPING

Winterpacht et al. (1996) mapped the CLAPS2 gene to chromosome
19q13.2-q13.3 by fluorescence in situ hybridization.

In affected members of 2 unrelated 3-generation families segregating
autosomal dominant hypocalciuric hypercalcemia mapping to chromosome
19q13 (HHC3; 600740), Nesbit et al. (2013) identified heterozygosity for
a missense mutation in the AP2S1 gene (R15C; 602242.0001). Analysis of
AP2S1 in 50 unrelated patients with hypocalciuric hypercalcemia revealed
11 who were heterozygous for AP2S1 mutations, all of which involved the
R15 residue: R15C in 4 patients, R15L (602242.0002) in 4 patients, and
R15H (602242.0003) in 3 patients. Nesbit et al. (2013) suggested that
the R15 residue represents a mutation hotspot, and estimated that AP2S1
missense mutations involving R15 may be the underlying cause of HHC in
more than 20% of HHC patients without mutations in the CASR (601199)
gene. Functional analysis demonstrated that the AP2S1 mutations
decreased the sensitivity of CASR-expressing cells to extracellular
calcium and reduced CASR endocytosis, probably through loss of
interaction with a C-terminal CASR dileucine-based motif, the disruption
of which also decreased intracellular signaling.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HYPOCALCIURIC HYPERCALCEMIA, FAMILIAL, TYPE III
AP2S1, ARG15CYS

In affected members of 2 unrelated 3-generation families segregating
autosomal dominant hypocalciuric hypercalcemia mapping to chromosome
19q13 (HHC3; 600740), 1 of which was a kindred from Oklahoma originally
described by McMurtry et al. (1992) and the other a kindred from
Northern Ireland originally reported by Nesbit et al. (2010), Nesbit et
al. (2013) identified heterozygosity for a C-T transition in exon 2 of
the AP2S1 gene, resulting in an arg15-to-cys (R15C) substitution at an
evolutionarily conserved residue. The R15C mutation was subsequently
identified in heterozygosity in 4 additional unrelated probands with
hypocalciuric hypercalcemia. Functional analysis in transiently
transfected HEK293 cells showed a rightward shift in Ca(2+)
concentration-response curves with the AP2S1 mutant compared to
wildtype, indicating a decrease in the sensitivity of cells expressing
CASR (601199) to extracellular calcium.

AP2S1, ARG15LEU

In 4 unrelated probands with hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (HHC3; 600740),
Nesbit et al. (2013) identified heterozygosity for a G-T transversion in
exon 2 of the AP2S1 gene, resulting in an arg15-to-leu (R15L)
substitution at an evolutionarily conserved residue. Functional analysis
in transiently transfected HEK293 cells showed a rightward shift in
Ca(2+) concentration-response curves with the AP2S1 mutant compared to
wildtype, indicating a decrease in the sensitivity of cells expressing
CASR (601199) to extracellular calcium.

In 3 unrelated probands with hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (HHC3; 600740),
Nesbit et al. (2013) identified heterozygosity for a G-A transition in
exon 2 of the AP2S1 gene, resulting in an arg15-to-his (R15H)
substitution at an evolutionarily conserved residue. Functional analysis
in transiently transfected HEK293 cells showed a rightward shift in
Ca(2+) concentration-response curves with the AP2S1 mutant compared to
wildtype, indicating a decrease in the sensitivity of cells expressing
CASR (601199) to extracellular calcium.

605853	TITLE *605853 CYTOPLASMIC LINKER-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 2; CLASP2
;;CLIP-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CLASP2 belongs to a family of microtubule plus-end tracking proteins
that localize to the distal ends of microtubules and regulate
microtubule dynamics. CLASP2 functions in various microtubule-dependent
processes, including cell division, cytoskeletal remodeling for cell
migration, and vesicle transport between intracellular structures and
the plasma membrane (summary by Langlais et al., 2012).

CLONING

CLIP170 (179838) and CLIP115 (603432) are cytoplasmic linker proteins
that associate specifically with the ends of growing microtubules and
may act as anticatastrophe factors. Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen with
an N-terminal region of CLIP115 as bait, followed by cDNA library
screening, RACE analysis, and EST database searching, Akhmanova et al.
(2001) identified mouse and human cDNAs encoding 2 CLIP-associated
proteins, CLASP1 (605852) and CLASP2. The CLASPs are homologous to a
Drosophila microtubule-associated protein termed Orbit or Mast. CLASP1
is identical to the protein encoded by a partial cDNA, KIAA0622,
identified by Ishikawa et al. (1998), although the KIAA0622 protein
lacks the N-terminal 249 amino acids of the 1,538-amino acid CLASP1
protein reported by Akhmanova et al. (2001). CLASP2 shares approximately
75% identity with the KIAA0627 protein, which is encoded by a partial
cDNA also identified by Ishikawa et al. (1998). There are several CLASP
isoforms due to alternative splicing. Northern blot analysis of mouse
tissues detected highest expression of Clasp1 in brain, heart, and
testis, while Clasp2 mRNAs were enriched in the brain. The Clasp2-beta
transcript appeared to be brain-specific. By RT-PCR analysis, Ishikawa
et al. (1998) detected variable but ubiquitous expression of CLASP2, or
KIAA0627, except in spleen.

GENE FUNCTION

Akhmanova et al. (2001) showed that CLASPs bind CLIPs and microtubules,
colocalize with the CLIPs at microtubule distal ends, and have
microtubule-stabilizing effects in transfected cells. After serum
induction, CLASPs relocalize to distal segments of microtubules at the
leading edge of motile fibroblasts. Akhmanova et al. (2001) provided
evidence that this asymmetric CLASP distribution is mediated by
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (see 171834) and glycogen synthase kinase
3-beta (605004). Antibody injections suggested that CLASP2 is required
for the orientation of stabilized microtubules toward the leading edge.
The authors proposed that CLASPs are involved in the local regulation of
microtubule dynamics in response to positional cues.

Using rat L6 myoblasts and mouse 3T3-L1 adipocytes, Langlais et al.
(2012) determined that Clasp2 has a role in insulin (176730) signaling
and glucose uptake. Confocal imaging of L6 myotubes revealed that Clasp2
colocalized with the glucose transporter Glut4 (SLC2A4; 138190) at the
plasma membrane within areas of insulin-mediated cortical actin
remodeling. Clasp2 underwent insulin-stimulated phosphorylation, and
knockdown of Clasp2 via small interfering RNA inhibited
insulin-stimulated Glut4 translocation along microtubules toward the
plasma membrane. Knockdown of Clasp2 in adipocytes inhibited
insulin-stimulated glucose transport. Langlais et al.(2012) concluded
that CLASP2 has a role in insulin signaling and directs the delivery of
GLUT4 to the plasma membrane for glucose uptake.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Ishikawa et al. (1998) mapped the CLASP2
gene, which they called KIAA0627, to chromosome 3.

Hartz (2013) mapped the CLASP2 gene to chromosome 3p22.3 based on an
alignment of the CLASP2 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AB014527) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

605607	TITLE *605607 CENTROMERIC PROTEIN H; CENPH
DESCRIPTION See (117140). Earnshaw (1991) discussed the distinction between
centromere and kinetochore.

Centromere and kinetochore proteins have a pivotal role in centromere
structure, kinetochore formation and sister chromatid separation. Sugata
et al. (2000) isolated centromeric protein H (CENPH) cDNAs from a HeLa
cell cDNA library. The full-length cDNA encodes a deduced 247-amino acid
protein with a predicted molecular mass of approximately 28 kD. Human
CENPH has 67% amino acid sequence identity with mouse CENPH. The human
protein contains a predicted coiled-coil structure and a putative
nuclear localization signal RKKR. Confocal microscopic analyses of HeLa
cells with antihuman CENPH-specific antibody demonstrated that CENPH
colocalizes with inner kinetochore plate proteins CENPA (117139) and
CENPC (117141) in both interphase and metaphase. CENPH was present
outside centromeric heterochromatin, where CENPB (117140) is localized,
and inside the kinetochore corona, where CENPE (117143) is localized
during prometaphase. Furthermore, CENPH was detected at neocentromeres,
but not at inactive centromeres in stable dicentric chromosomes. In
vitro binding assays of human CENPH with centromere-kinetochore proteins
suggested that the CENPH binds to itself and mitotic
centromere-associated kinesin (604538), but not to CENPA, CENPB or
CENPC. CENPH multimers were observed in cells in which both FLAG-tagged
CENPH and hemagglutinin-tagged CENPH were expressed. The authors
suggested that CENPH multimers localize constitutively to the inner
kinetochore plate and play an important fundamental role in organization
and function of the active human centromere-kinetochore complex.

312420	TITLE *312420 RENIN-BINDING PROTEIN; RENBP
DESCRIPTION Renin-binding protein, originally isolated from porcine kidney, is a
proteinaceous renin inhibitor. In inhibiting renin, the protein forms a
complex with it, so-called high molecular weight renin. The nucleotide
sequences of cDNAs encoding the porcine, human, and rat renin-binding
proteins, the predicted amino acid sequences consist of 402, 417, and
419 amino acids, respectively. Sequences of the three are highly
homologous. The leucine zipper motif, which is a key structure for the
formation of a heterodimer or a homodimer of several proteins, was also
conserved in each RENBP. From studies of the RENBP gene isolated from a
human placental genomic library, Takahashi et al. (1992) found that it
spans about 10 kb and consists of 11 exons separated by 10 introns. By
polymerase chain reaction amplification of hybrid DNAs from human and
hamster somatic cells, they demonstrated that the RENBP gene is located
on the X chromosome. Using the method by which cDNA libraries are
screened with positionally identified genomic clones, van den Ouweland
et al. (1994) mapped the RENBP gene to Xq28 between DXS52 and G6PD in
the same interval as that for the colorblindness gene, DXS707, and the
AVPR2 (300538), L1CAM (308840), and QM (312173) genes. Cosmid clones
were selected from a cosmid library derived from the Q1Z cell line, a
hamster/human somatic cell hybrid that contains the Xq28 region as its
sole human component (Warren et al., 1990). Kidney-expressed genes were
sought by screening a kidney cDNA library with cosmid-derived probes.

Faranda et al. (1995) found that the 3-prime end of HCFC1 (300019) lies
2,763-bp upstream from the 3-prime end of the RENBP gene. Thus both
genes are transcribed in the same direction from the telomere to the
centromere.

In human populations that have remained of small and constant size, high
levels of linkage disequilibrium (LD) are generated by genetic drift.
Theoretical considerations suggest that such LD can be used to identify
chromosomal regions involved in diseases or other traits, by 'drift
mapping' (Terwilliger et al., 1998). This concept relies on the
assumption that when 'cases' and 'controls' are compared within a
population in which extensive LD exists, disequilibrium will be observed
between the trait and marker loci close to the gene(s) that contributes
to the trait. To evaluate this idea empirically, Laan and Paabo (1998)
studied polymorphic loci in and around the RENBP gene. They used
particularly the 61T-C polymorphism which was described by Knoll et al.
(1997) and which occurs with a frequency of 0.18 in Germans. They scored
this polymorphism in males from the Saami and the Finns, 2 populations
that differ radically in their demographic history. Whereas the Saami
have not expanded during historical times and show no indication of
expansion in tests based on DNA sequence variability, the Finns are
thought to have expanded drastically during the past few thousand years,
on the basis of both epidemiologic and genetic evidence. The frequency
of the C allele was found to be 0.21 and 0.19 in the Saami and the
Finns, respectively. The fact that the C allele occurs at appreciably
higher frequencies in 3 European populations indicates that it is older
than these populations. It was therefore a useful model of alleles
involved in complex traits, since such alleles are expected to be both
frequent in the population and of old age. The findings confirmed the
hypothesis that, in principle, LD generated by drift in a small and
constant population can be used to localize a gene, whereas it is
difficult, if not impossible, in a population that has expanded. Laan
and Paabo (1998) expressed the hope that chromosomal regions involved in
complex traits could be identified by an approach based on LD in
populations such as the Saami.

171740	TITLE *171740 ALKALINE PHOSPHATASE, INTESTINAL; ALPI
;;IAP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Lehmann (1980) provided biochemical corroboration of the genetic
distinctness of 3 alkaline phosphatases: intestinal, placental (171800),
and liver/bone/kidney (171760). The existence of at least 1 gene coding
for the intestinal forms (adult and fetal), independent of the other
forms, is inescapable (Goldstein et al., 1980). Gogolin et al. (1982)
found a monoclonal antibody raised against purified human placental
alkaline phosphatase that crossreacted with the adult and fetal forms of
intestinal alkaline phosphatase, despite the fact that the placental and
intestinal enzymes are nonallelic. Berger et al. (1987) used alkaline
phosphatase cDNA as a probe to clone intestinal alkaline phosphatase
cDNA, since partial protein sequence data indicated a high degree of
homology between intestinal alkaline phosphatase and the reported
sequence of the placental isoenzyme. Intestinal alkaline phosphatase
cDNA, which is 3.1 kb, is somewhat larger than the cDNA for the
placental isoenzyme, which is 2.8 kb. Differences and similarities were
pointed out.

Henthorn et al. (1987) isolated and sequenced a cDNA that encodes the
alkaline phosphatase expressed in adult human intestine and compared the
sequence with those previously determined for the placental and
liver/bone/kidney cDNAs. The deduced polypeptide showed 86.5% amino acid
identity to placental ALP and 56.6% amino acid identity to
liver/bone/kidney ALP. Thus, the immunologic cross-reactivity of ALPI
and ALPP is perhaps explained.

GENE FUNCTION

Humans (Langman et al., 1966) and rodents (Gould, 1944) fed a diet with
a high fat content had elevated levels of circulating alkaline
phosphatase, the source of which was the intestinal isozyme.

Using wildtype and Iap-knockout mice and in vitro assays with human and
rat intestinal cell lines, Goldberg et al. (2008) showed that IAP could
detoxify lipopolysaccharide and prevent bacterial invasion across the
gut mucosal barrier. Iap expression and function in mice were lost with
starvation and maintained by enteral feeding. Goldberg et al. (2008)
concluded that IAP silencing that occurs during starvation is a key
component of the gut mucosal barrier dysfunction seen in critically ill
patients.

GENE STRUCTURE

Henthorn et al. (1988) isolated and sequenced the ALPI gene in its
entirety. The gene is composed of 11 exons. Introns in intestinal,
placental, and liver/bone/kidney ALP genes occur at analogous positions,
confirming that these genes arose from a single ancestral gene.

MAPPING

Henthorn et al. (1987) stated that the placental and intestinal ALP
genes map to the same region of chromosome 2. Griffin et al. (1987)
mapped both the placental and the intestinal alkaline phosphatase genes
to 2q34-q37 by chromosomal in situ hybridization and hybridization to
the DNA of somatic cell hybrids. By fluorescence in situ hybridization,
Wu et al. (1993) mapped ALPI to 2q36.3-q37.1. Pasteris et al. (1993)
concluded from a molecular analysis of a chromosome 2 deletion mapping
panel that the ALPI gene is on the telomeric side of both PAX3 (606597)
and COL4A3 (120070) and close to CHRND (100720).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Harris et al. (1974) found no genetic variants of ALPI by
electrophoretic means.

612489	TITLE *612489 RING FINGER PROTEIN 24; RNF24
;;GOLIATH-LIKE PROTEIN (C3CH4 TYPE); G1L
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

RNF24 binds TRPC6 (603652) and other transient receptor potential cation
channel family members and is involved in regulation of the trafficking
and insertion of TRPCs into the plasma membrane (Lussier et al., 2008).

CLONING

By yeast 2-hybrid screen of a human fetal brain cDNA library with TRPC6
as bait, followed by RT-PCR of total RNA from HEK293 cells, Lussier et
al. (2008) cloned RNF24. The deduced 148-amino acid protein contains an
N-terminal transmembrane domain and a C-terminal RING-H2 domain. Sodium
carbonate treatment and immunofluorescence confocal microscopy,
determined that RNF24 is an integral membrane protein localized
primarily to the Golgi apparatus.

GENE FUNCTION

By GST pull-down assay using TRPC6 deletion mutants, Lussier et al.
(2008) showed that RNF24 interacted with the first and second
ankyrin-like repeats of TRPC6. They showed that RNF24 RING-H2 domain
interacted with the ankyrin-like repeats of TRPC1 (602343), TRPC3
(602345), TRPC4 (603651), TRPC5 (300334), and TRPC7 (TRPM2; 603749).
Biotinylation and confocal laser-scanning microscopy studies showed that
RNF24 plays a role in reduction of trafficking and insertion of TRPCs
into the plasma membrane. Pulsed-chase experiments and TRPC6 activation
assays showed that RNF24 was not involved in the maturation or
degradation of TRPC6 and did not regulate TRPC activity.

612408	TITLE *612408 PARASPECKLE COMPONENT 1; PSPC1
;;PARASPECKLE PROTEIN 1; PSP1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By mass spectrometry of proteins isolated from purified HeLa cell
nucleoli, Andersen et al. (2002) identified PSPC1, which they called
PSP1. By SDS-PAGE, PSP1 had an apparent molecular mass of about 66.3 kD.

By EST database analysis and PCR, Fox et al. (2002) obtained 2 splice
variants of PSPC1, which they called PSP1-alpha and -beta. The deduced
523-amino acid PSP1-alpha protein has a calculated molecular mass of
58.7 kD. PSP1-beta contains 393 amino acids and is identical to
PSP1-alpha for the first 386 amino acids. Both PSP1 isoforms have 2
RNA-binding domains in their N-terminal halves. Northern blot analysis
detected ubiquitous expression of at least 2 PSP1 transcripts of about
2.5 kb. Both PSP1 isoforms colocalized with p54NRB (NONO; 300084) and
PSP2 (RBM14; 612409) in nucleoplasmic structures called paraspeckles,
which were adjacent to but distinct from SC35 (SFRS2; 600813)-containing
splicing speckles.

GENE FUNCTION

Fox et al. (2002) found that PSP1, PSP2, and p54NRB relocalized from
paraspeckles to the perinucleolar cap region upon transcriptional
blockade.

By histochemical analysis of HeLa cells using PSP1 as a marker protein,
Fox et al. (2005) found that paraspeckles persisted throughout
interphase and during most of mitosis, and only disappeared once
daughter nuclei formed in telophase. The authors noted that this
behavior contrasts with the behavior of other nuclear bodies, which
disassemble when cells enter mitosis. In telophase, before transcription
recommenced after cell division, fluorescence-tagged PSP1 transiently
colocalized with newly formed nucleoli at perinucleolar caps.
Immunoprecipitation and protein pull-down experiments showed that PSP1
formed a heterodimer with p54NRB. Mutation analysis showed that
targeting of PSP1 to paraspeckles required either of its RNA-binding
domains and its C-terminal coiled-coil domain, whereas accumulation of
PSP1 at perinucleolar caps and its interaction with p54NRB required only
the C-terminal coiled-coil domain. Since p54NRB predominantly forms a
complex with PSF (SFPQ; 605199), Fox et al. (2005) suggested that a
small proportion of p54NRP interacts with PSP1 and that this
interaction, in addition to binding RNA, is required for targeting of
PSP1 to paraspeckles and perinucleolar caps.

MAPPING

Hartz (2008) mapped the PSPC1 gene to chromosome 13q12.11 based on an
alignment of the PSPC1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF448795) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.1).

602052	TITLE *602052 CYCLIN G-ASSOCIATED KINASE; GAK
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

In all eukaryotes, the cell cycle is governed by cyclin-dependent
protein kinases (CDKs), whose activities are regulated by cyclins and
CDK inhibitors in a diverse array of mechanisms that involve the control
of phosphorylation-dephosphorylation of ser/thr or tyr residues. Cyclins
are molecules that possess a consensus domain called the 'cyclin box.'
In mammalian cells, 9 cyclin species have been identified to this time,
and they are referred to as cyclins A (123835) through I. Cyclin G
(601578) is a direct transcriptional target of the p53 tumor suppressor
gene product (191170) and thus functions downstream of p53. Kimura et
al. (1997) reported the cloning of a cDNA encoding the human homolog of
GAK, an association partner of cyclin G and CDK5 (123831), which had
previously been cloned in the rat. They showed that the cDNA encodes a
protein of 1,311 amino acids containing all the unique motifs
characteristic of rat GAK. The expression profiles of GAK and cyclin G
during the synchronized HeLa cell cycle showed that GAK expression
oscillates slightly, peaking at the G1 phase, although histone H1 kinase
activity remained constant throughout the cell cycle. Northern blot
analysis showed that GAK is expressed ubiquitously, with the highest
level of expression being observed in the testis.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Kimura et al. (1997) assigned the
GAK gene to chromosome 4p16.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

gene and susceptibility to the development of Parkinson disease, see

;;COMPLEX I, MITOCHONDRIAL RESPIRATORY CHAIN, 23-KD SUBUNIT;;
TYKY
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

See NDUFA2 (602137). The NDUFS8 subunit of complex I is highly conserved
among eukaryotes and prokaryotes and contains 2 4Fe4S ferredoxin
consensus patterns, which appear to provide the binding sites for the
iron-sulfur cluster N-2. The NDUFS8 cDNA encodes a predicted 210-amino
acid protein (Procaccio et al., 1997).

GENE STRUCTURE

De Sury et al. (1998) found that the NDUFS8 gene contains 7 exons
spanning approximately 6 kb of genomic DNA. Northern blot analysis
showed that expression of NDUFS8 is ubiquitous but highest in heart and
skeletal muscle.

MAPPING

De Sury et al. (1998) showed that NDUFS8 is on chromosome 11q13 near
ALDH7 based on sequence of a cosmid containing both genes. Procaccio et
al. (1997) also mapped the NDUFS8 gene to 11q13 by in situ
hybridization. By intron-based radiation hybrid mapping, Emahazion and
Brookes (1998) mapped the NDUFS8 gene to 11q13.1-q13.3.

Dunbar et al. (1997) had mapped the NDUFS8 gene to 3q28 by fluorescence
in situ hybridization. Emahazion and Brookes (1998) stated that the FISH
data of Dunbar et al. (1997) were flawed.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

By cycle sequencing of amplified NDUFS8 cDNA of 20 patients with
isolated enzymatic complex I deficiency, Loeffen et al. (1998) found 1
patient with neuropathologically proven Leigh syndrome (256000) who was
a genetic compound for 2 different mutations (602141.0001 and
602141.0002). Both mutations were absent in 70 control alleles and
cosegregated within the family.

By exome sequencing, Haack et al. (2012) identified biallelic mutations
in the NDUFS8 gene (602141.0005-602141.0007) in 3 patients from 2
unrelated families with complex I deficiency (252010). Two patients in 1
family had Leigh syndrome.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
LEIGH SYNDROME DUE TO MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX I DEFICIENCY
NDUFS8, PRO79LEU

In a patient with mitochondrial complex I deficiency (252010)
manifesting as Leigh syndrome (256000), Loeffen et al. (1998) identified
a 236C-T transition in the NDUFS8 gene, resulting in a pro79-to-leu
(P79L) substitution. The patient was a compound heterozygote, the other
mutation being a 305G-A transition resulting in an arg102-to-his (R102H;
602141.0002) substitution. The patient was 5 weeks old when he presented
with poor feeding and episodes of apnea and cyanosis. The symptoms,
which had existed since the first day of life, escalated in the course
of an acute gastroenteritis. The parents were nonconsanguineous. Cardiac
examination revealed a moderate hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy.
CT scan of the brain showed extensive white matter hypodensity, mild
ventricular enlargement, and hypodense symmetric lesions in putamen and
mesencephalon. The disorder progressed, leading to death at the age of
11 weeks from cardiorespiratory failure.

NDUFS8, PRO85LEU

In a patient with late onset of complex I deficiency (252010)
manifesting as Leigh syndrome (256000), Procaccio and Wallace (2004)
identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the NDUFS8 gene: a
254C-T transition, resulting in a pro85-to-leu (P85L) substitution, and
a 413G-A transition, resulting in an arg138-to-his (R138H; 602141.0004)
substitution. The patient first developed walking difficulties at age 7
years, which progressed to balance impairment, dysarthria, mild dystonic
posture, and nystagmus. Brain imaging showed bilateral symmetric lesions
in the putamen. Complex I activity in the patient's skeletal muscle and
lymphoblasts was reduced to 31% and 43% of controls, respectively.
Western blot analysis showed decreased amounts of the NDUFS8 protein and
other nuclear complex I subunits, suggesting that NDUFS8 may play a role
in complex I assembly. Procaccio and Wallace (2004) suggested that the
mild phenotype in this patient may have resulted from partial
preservation of electron transport, as neither mutation disrupted the
cysteine motifs thought to be associated with 4Fe-4S clusters.

In a patient with complex I deficiency (252010), Haack et al. (2012)
identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the NDUFS8 gene: a
229C-T transition resulting in an arg77-to-trp (R77W) substitution, and
a 476C-A transversion resulting in an ala159-to-asp (A159D; 602141.0006)
substitution. Both mutations occurred at highly conserved residues. Each
unaffected parent was heterozygous for 1 of the mutations, which were
identified by exome sequencing of the patient. The patient had
mitochondrial encephalopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, hypotonia,
and respiratory insufficiency. Complex I activity in muscle and
fibroblasts was 38% and 52% of normal, respectively, and there was a
decreased amount of fully assembled complex I compared to control.
Expression of wildtype NDUFS8 in patient fibroblasts rescued the
biochemical defect and restored assembly of complex I.

In a patient with Leigh syndrome due to complex I deficiency (256000),
Haack et al. (2012) identified a homozygous 187G-C transversion in the
NDUFS8 gene, resulting in a glu63-to-gln (E63Q) substitution at a highly
conserved residue. Each unaffected parent was heterozygous for the
mutation, which was found by exome sequencing of the patient. This
homozygous mutation was also present in an affected sib. The patients
had Leigh syndrome, hypotonia, and lactic acidosis. One had seizures and
the other had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Complex I activity in the
proband was 8% in muscle and 54% in fibroblasts, and there was a
decreased amount of assembled complex I. Expression of wildtype NDUFS8
in patient fibroblasts rescued the biochemical defect and restored
complex I assembly.

609080	TITLE *609080 F-BOX AND LEUCINE-RICH REPEAT PROTEIN 13; FBXL13
;;FBL13
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the F-box protein family, such as FBXL13, are characterized
by an approximately 40-amino acid F-box motif. SCF complexes, formed by
SKP1 (601434), cullin (see CUL1; 603134), and F-box proteins, act as
protein-ubiquitin ligases. F-box proteins interact with SKP1 through the
F box, and they interact with ubiquitination targets through other
protein interaction domains (Jin et al., 2004).

CLONING

Jin et al. (2004) reported that the human FBXL13 protein contains an
N-terminal F box, followed by a tandem array of 4 leucine-rich repeats,
a short spacer, and a second tandem array of 7 leucine-rich repeats.

By Northern blot analysis, Curtiss et al. (2005) identified 2 FBXL13
mRNA splice variants in a leukemia cell line. A message of about 1.6 kb
encodes a protein with an F-box domain and 5 leucine-rich repeats, and a
message of about 2.3 kb encodes a protein with an F-box domain and 12
leucine-rich repeats.

GENE STRUCTURE

Curtiss et al. (2005) determined that the FBXL13 gene contains 19 exons
and spans 261 kb.

MAPPING

Jin et al. (2004) stated that the FBXL13 gene maps to chromosome 7q22.1
and the mouse Fbxl13 gene maps to chromosome 5A3.

602280	TITLE *602280 TUBBY-LIKE PROTEIN 1; TULP1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TULP1, a member of the tubby-like protein (TULP) family, is expressed
exclusively in the retina, where it is involved in protein trafficking
and is essential for the transport of rhodopsin (180380) from its site
of synthesis in the inner segments through the connecting cilium to the
outer segments (summary by den Hollander et al., 2007).

CLONING

Members of a family of tubby-like genes (TULPs) have been identified in
plants, vertebrates, and invertebrates. The TUB gene (601197), which is
homologous to the mouse Tub gene, is a member of this family. North et
al. (1997) identified the more distantly related TULP1 and TULP2 genes
in humans. All 3 genes encode proteins with different N termini but with
conserved C-terminal regions (63 to 90% amino acid identity) of
approximately 200 amino acid residues. They also have distinct tissue
expression patterns; TUB is expressed in many tissues including retina,
whereas TULP1 is expressed exclusively in retina and TULP2 in retina and
testis.

MAPPING

North et al. (1997) demonstrated by fluorescence in situ hybridization
that the TULP1 gene is located within 6p21.3. This, together with its
retina-specific expression and its homology with the murine tub gene,
suggested it as a candidate gene for retinitis pigmentosa-14 (RP14;
600132), which had been mapped to 6p21.3 by linkage analysis in a large
Dominican RP pedigree (Knowles et al., 1994).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Retinitis Pigmentosa 14

In an analysis of 162 patients with nonsyndromic recessive RP and 374
simplex cases of RP, Hagstrom et al. (1998) found 2 patients who were
compound heterozygotes for mutations in the TULP1 gene that cosegregated
with disease in the respective families (e.g., 602280.0001,
602280.0003). Three of the mutations were missense changes affecting the
conserved C-terminal region; the fourth mutation (602280.0004) affected
a splice donor site upstream of this region.

Simultaneously and independently, Banerjee et al. (1998) found that
autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa in 2 extended Dominican
kindreds with linkage to TULP1 and to 6p21.3 by linkage studies carried
a splice site mutation (602280.0005). The mutation was homozygous in all
33 affected individuals and heterozygous in all 50 obligate carriers.
The mutation was not observed in 210 unrelated controls. The data from
the 2 studies indicated that mutation in TULP1 is a rare cause of
recessive RP and that TULP1 plays an essential role in the physiology of
photoreceptors.

By haplotype analysis in 49 Spanish autosomal recessive RP pedigrees,
Paloma et al. (2000) excluded TULP1 as the cause of the disease in 42.
In affected individuals in 1 of the remaining 7 families, they
identified 2 more TULP1 mutations in compound heterozygous state.

In affected members of a Surinamese family with severe early-onset
retinal dystrophy, den Hollander et al. (2007) identified compound
heterozygosity for mutations in TULP1 (602280.0007-602280.0008).

- Retinitis Pigmentosa, Juvenile, TULP1-Related

In 4 unrelated patients diagnosed with juvenile retinitis pigmentosa
(see 613843), den Hollander et al. (2007) identified homozygosity for
mutations in the TULP1 gene (see, e.g., 602280.0009).

- Leber Congenital Amaurosis 15

In 179 unrelated patients diagnosed with Leber congenital amaurosis
(LCA15; 613843), Hanein et al. (2004) analyzed 7 known LCA genes and
identified homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the TULP1
gene in 3 probands (602280.0004 and 602280.0010-602280.0012,
respectively).

In 7 affected individuals from 3 sibships of a large consanguineous
Algerian pedigree with LCA or early-onset retinal degeneration (see
613843), Mataftsi et al. (2007) identified homozygosity for a 6-bp
duplication in the TULP1 gene (602280.0013). The duplication segregated
with disease in the family in homozygous state and was not found in 51
ethnically matched controls. In addition, this mutation was not detected
in 500 RP probands. Mataftsi et al. (2007) noted that the phenotype in
this family was of a similar degree of severity and progression of
visual handicap as that of the large Dominican RP kindred reported by
Banerjee et al. (1998) with a homozygous splice site mutation in TULP1
(602280.0005).

ANIMAL MODEL

A recessive mutation in the Tub gene causes early-onset blindness and
deafness as well as late-onset obesity and insulin resistance. To test
the hypothesis that mutations in other members of the tubby-like gene
family would lead to a phenotype similar to that observed in tubby mice,
and hence have similar functional properties, Ikeda et al. (2000)
generated null mutants of the Tulp1 gene by homologous recombination.
Like tubby mice, Tulp1 -/- mice exhibited an early-onset retinal
degeneration with a progressive, rapid loss of photoreceptors, further
supporting the notion that previously identified mutations within the
human TULP1 gene are indeed causative of retinitis pigmentosa. However,
in contrast to tubby mice, Tulp1 -/- mice exhibited normal hearing and,
surprisingly, normal body weight despite the fact that both Tub and
Tulp1 were expressed in the same neurons within the hypothalamus, in
areas known to be involved in feeding behavior and energy homeostasis.
However, Tub and Tulp1 showed a distinctly different staining pattern in
the nucleus of these neurons, perhaps explaining the difference in body
weight between Tulp1 -/- and tubby mutant mice.

RETINITIS PIGMENTOSA 14
TULP1, ARG420PRO

In a patient with autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (600132),
Hagstrom et al. (1998) found compound heterozygosity for 2 missense
mutations: arg420 to pro and phe491 to leu (602280.0002). This patient
represented 1 of 162 nonsyndromic recessive RP patients studied.

Among 347 simplex cases of nonsyndromal RP (600132), Hagstrom et al.
(1998) found 1 who was compound heterozygote for a missense change,
ile459 to lys, and a splice donor site mutation, IVS2+1G-to-A
(602280.0004), affecting the consensus splice donor site of intron 2 of
the TULP1 gene.

In a patient of Italian origin from a multiplex family with Leber
congenital amaurosis (LCA15; 613843), Hanein et al. (2004) identified
compound heterozygosity for the IVS2+1G-A splice mutation in the TULP1
gene (99+1G-A), and a nonsense mutation (E402X; 602280.0010).

.0005
RETINITIS PIGMENTOSA 14
TULP1, IVS14DS, G-A, +1

In 2 extended Dominican kindreds, Banerjee et al. (1998) found that
autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (600132) was associated with
homozygosity for a splice site mutation (IVS14+1, G-A) in the TULP1
gene.

.0006
RETINITIS PIGMENTOSA 14
TULP1, PHE382SER

In a 20-year-old Japanese woman diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa
(600132) at 8 years of age, Kondo et al. (2004) detected an 1145T-to-C
transition in the TULP1 gene that resulted in a phe382-to-ser (F382S)
amino acid substitution. Phe382 is located in the tubby C-terminal
domain and is highly conserved between human, mouse, rat, and chicken
TULP1 as well as human TULP2 (602309). The patient's affected brother
also received a diagnosis of retinitis pigmentosa together with color
vision alteration at 8 years of age. Although the clinical features of
these sibs matched well with previously reported features, the patients
lacked severe central vision dysfunction and nystagmus, which had been
regarded as characteristic findings at all stages of the disease (Lewis
et al., 1999), suggesting that the F382S mutation results in a
relatively mild reduction of protein function.

.0007
RETINITIS PIGMENTOSA 14
TULP1, ARG482TRP

In affected members of a Surinamese family with autosomal recessive
retinitis pigmentosa (600132) mapping to 6p21, den Hollander et al.
(2007) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the TULP1
gene: a 1444C-T transition in exon 14, resulting in an arg482-to-trp
(R482W) substitution, and an 11-bp deletion (1511-1521) in exon 15,
causing a frameshift and replacement of 39 C-terminal amino acids by 140
aberrant amino acid residues (leu504fsX140; 602280.0008). Unaffected
members of the family were either heterozygous for the R482W mutation or
did not carry the mutations. The R482W mutation was not detected in 92
control individuals. All affected family members had a severe
early-onset retinal dystrophy with a history of nystagmus, low visual
acuity, and night blindness since infancy. Scotopic and photopic
responses were nonrecordable on electroretinography.

TULP1, IVS7, T-C, +2

In 2 unrelated Afghan patients diagnosed with juvenile retinitis
pigmentosa (see 613843), den Hollander et al. (2007) identified
homozygosity for a 718+2T-C transition at the splice donor site in IVS7
of the TULP1 gene. Examination of the asymptomatic heterozygous parents
of 1 of the patients revealed normal visual acuities and
electroretinograms, but the mother had striking and easily discernible
multiple superior and inferior subretinal yellow-white dots just outside
of the vascular arcades.

TULP1, GLU402TER

In a patient of Italian origin from a multiplex family with Leber
congenital amaurosis (LCA15; 613843), Hanein et al. (2004) identified
compound heterozygosity for a splice site mutation in intron 2
(602280.0004) and a 1204G-T transversion in exon 12 of the TULP1 gene,
resulting in a glu402-to-ter (E402X) substitution.

.0011
LEBER CONGENITAL AMAUROSIS 15
TULP1, ARG400TRP

In a patient from a consanguineous family with Leber congenital
amaurosis (LCA15; 613843), Hanein et al. (2004) identified homozygosity
for a 1198C-T transition in exon 12 of the TULP1 gene, resulting in an
arg400-to-trp (R400W) substitution at a highly conserved residue in the
C terminus.

LEBER CONGENITAL AMAUROSIS 15
TULP1, GLY368TRP

In a patient from a consanguineous family with Leber congenital

TULP1, 6-BP DUP, NT1593

In 7 affected individuals from 3 sibships of a large consanguineous
Algerian pedigree with Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA15; 613843) or
early-onset retinal degeneration (see 613843), Mataftsi et al. (2007)
identified homozygosity for a 6-bp duplication (1593dupTTCGCC) in exon
15 of the TULP1 gene, predicted to duplicate 2 amino acids in the highly
conserved C terminus. The duplication was found in heterozygosity in the
unaffected parents and 15 other asymptomatic family members, but was not
found in 51 ethnically matched controls.

600696	TITLE *600696 ENOYL-CoA HYDRATASE, PEROXISOMAL; ECH1
DESCRIPTION Certain hypolipidemic agents ('cholesterol-lowering agents'), e.g.,
fibrates, and industrial plasticizers are known to activate the
transcription of genes encoding proteins involved in peroxisomal
beta-oxidation and to induce peroxisome proliferation in rodent
hepatocytes. The molecular basis of the transcriptional response to
these agents involves their interaction with peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) that bind as homo- or
heterodimers to a peroxisomal proliferator response element (PPRE)
identified in the promoter region of several upregulated genes. As a
means of identifying new genes involved in peroxisomal biogenesis and
function, FitzPatrick et al. (1995) used a subtractive hybridization
method to identify cDNAs that are transcriptionally activated by
treatment of rats with peroxisome proliferators. They identified a novel
rat liver cDNA that was induced more than 20-fold and encodes a
peroxisomal protein with homology to enoyl-CoA hydratases. They also
identified the orthologous human cDNA and mapped it to 19q13.1 by
Southern blot analysis of rodent/human somatic cell hybrids containing
different combinations of human chromosomes followed by hybridization to
high-density filter arrays of chromosome 19-specific cosmids. The human
ECH1 gene was found to map to a contig 3-prime to the ryanodine receptor
(RYR1; 180901). Northern blot analysis of human ECH1 tissue distribution
showed the 1.4-kb message to be present in every tissue examined, with
particularly high abundance in skeletal muscle. The monofunctional
enoyl-CoA hydratase is apparently distinct from the peroxisomal
bifunctional enzyme that also possesses hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase
activity (HSD17B4; 601860).

DESCRIPTION 
GENE FAMILY

See 602529 for general information about the alpha-tubulin gene family.

NOMENCLATURE

See Khodiyar et al. (2007) for a revised nomenclature of the
alpha-tubulin gene family.

CLONING

The human counterpart of the mouse tubulin gene M-alpha-2 is the
k-alpha-1 gene, cloned from a human keratinocyte cDNA library by Cowan
et al. (1983). The k-alpha-1 gene encodes a predicted 451-amino acid
protein that differs from the b-alpha-1 protein by only one amino acid.
By Northern blotting, k-alpha-1 mRNA was expressed in all tissues
tested.

By Northern blot analysis and in situ hybridization, Miller et al.
(1987) found that the rat homolog of k-alpha-1, which they called T26,
is expressed constitutively at a low level in most or all neural cell
types throughout development, with some enrichment in proliferative
zones.

MAPPING

Khodiyar et al. (2007) stated that the TUBA1B gene maps to human
chromosome 12q13.12 and mouse chromosome 15F1.

kD. NS1BP contains an N-terminal BTB/POZ domain that covers about 120
amino acids, followed by 5 imperfect tandem kelch repeats of 47 to 49
amino acids. Northern blot analysis of HeLa cell mRNA detected an NS1BP
transcript of about 3.1 kb. Western blot analysis detected endogenous
NS1BP as a protein doublet of about 70 kD in 3 human epithelium-derived
cell lines. Immunofluorescence analysis of HeLa cells revealed a
punctate nuclear staining pattern that colocalized with the spliceosome
assembly factor SC35 (SFRS2; 600813) and excluded nucleoli.

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) cloned IVNS1ABP, which they called
KIAA0850. The deduced protein contains 642 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA
detected ubiquitous expression, with highest levels in kidney and ovary,
followed by brain, liver, testis, heart, lung, and pancreas.
Intermediate expression was detected in skeletal muscle and spleen.

By subtractive hybridization to identify transcripts lost in Ncx (TLX2;
604240)-deficient mouse enteric neurons, followed by screening a mouse
heart cDNA library, Sasagawa et al. (2002) cloned 2 splice variants of
Ivns1abp that they designated Nd1-L and Nd1-S. Nd1-L encodes a deduced
protein with an N-terminal BTB/POX domain and 6 kelch repeats, whereas
Nd1-S encodes a protein lacking the kelch domains. Northern blot
analysis of mouse tissues detected a 3.2-kb Nd1-L transcript in all
tissues examined, with highest expression in heart, kidney, and small
and large intestine. An Nd1-S transcript of about 2.4 kb showed a more
restricted distribution.

GENE FUNCTION

By in vitro protein binding assays, Wolff et al. (1998) confirmed
binding between NS1BP and the influenza NS1 protein. Infection of HeLa
cells by influenza virus led to redistribution of NS1BP from nuclear
speckles, where it colocalized with SC35, to a more diffuse distribution
in the nucleoplasm, where it did not colocalize with SC35. Addition of a
truncated NS1BP mutant protein containing only the 5 kelch repeats to
HeLa cell nuclear extracts inhibited pre-mRNA splicing but not
spliceosome assembly.

Sasagawa et al. (2002) found that mouse Nd1-L and Nd1-S could form
dimers through their BTB/POZ domains. Confocal microscopy revealed that
Nd1-L colocalized with actin filaments, and its kelch repeats bound
actin filaments in vitro. Overexpression of Nd1-L in mouse fibroblasts
delayed cell growth by affecting the transition of cytokinesis.
Overexpression also protected mouse fibroblasts from cell death induced
by actin destabilization but not by microtubule dysfunction.
Overexpression of Nd1-S resulted in a disorganized actin cytoskeleton.
Sasagawa et al. (2002) concluded that Nd1-L functions as a stabilizer of
actin filaments and suggested that it may play a role in the dynamic
organization of the actin cytoskeleton.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the IVNS1ABP
gene to chromosome 1.

108361	TITLE *108361 ASIALOGLYCOPROTEIN RECEPTOR 2; ASGR2
;;C-TYPE LECTIN DOMAIN FAMILY 4, MEMBER H2; CLEC4H2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The ASGR2 gene encodes a glycoprotein that forms the asialoglycoprotein
receptor, also known as the Ashwell receptor, which is specific for
desialylated (galactosyl-terminal) glycoproteins and is expressed
exclusively in hepatic parenchymal cells (Spiess and Lodish, 1985).

See also ASGR1 (108360).

CLONING

From the same cDNA library that was made from the human hepatoma cell
line HepG2 and was used to isolate ASGR1, Spiess and Lodish (1985)
isolated and sequenced a clone encoding a second asialoglycoprotein
receptor, which they referred to as H2 and which had protein sequence
homology of 58% to H1. The rat similarly has 2 ASG receptors, R1 and R2.
Spiess and Lodish (1985) found that H1 is more homologous to R1 than to
H2, and H2 is more homologous to R2 than to H1. Thus, the 2 receptor
genes evolved before the separation of rat and man. Spiess and Lodish
(1985) identified 2 versions of H2 cDNA, differing only by the presence
or absence of a segment of 15 bp within the coding region. They
interpreted this as reflecting differential splicing of an intron.

ANIMAL MODEL

Grewal et al. (2008) found that platelet deficiency associated with
St3gal4 (104240) deficiency and disruption of sialyltransferase function
was restored in Asgr1- or Asgr2-deficient mice. The studies suggested
that ST3GAL4 deficiency exposes endogenous glycan ligands on platelets
that are recognized by the Ashwell receptor in an interaction that
promotes asialo-platelet clearance by hepatocytes and leads to
thrombocytopenia. Wildtype mice infected with Streptococcus pneumoniae,
a pathogen with sialidase (neuraminidase) activity, showed progressively
desialylated platelets and thrombocytopenia due to increased removal of
platelets from the circulation by the hepatic Ashwell receptor. Asgr1-
or Asgr2-deficient mice who were infected showed decreased survival and
signs of severe disseminated intravascular coagulation compared to
infected wildtype mice, with the outcome worse for Asgr1-deficient mice.
Grewal et al. (2008) concluded that the thrombocytopenia in disseminated
intravascular coagulation results from Ashwell receptor-dependent
clearance of platelets that are first desialylated by the sialidase of
the pathogen. The findings revealed that von Willebrand factor (VWF;
613160) and platelets are endogenous ligands of the Ashwell receptor,
implying that hepatocytes are involved in the clearance of these
coagulation factors from the circulation, which is an unexpected
biologic activity for this cell type.

610626	TITLE *610626 PPAP2 DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1B; PPAPDC1B
;;HTPAP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Previous studies of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) suggested that
deletion of a region of human chromosome 8p contributes to HCC
metastasis. Using cDNA microarray analysis of chromosome 8 ESTs from HCC
cell lines to identify genes with downregulated expression in high
metastatic potential versus low metastatic potential cell lines,
followed by database analysis and RT-PCR, Wu et al. (2006) cloned
PPAPDC1B, which they called HTPAP. The 175-amino acid protein contains
an N-terminal transmembrane domain, an acid phosphatase homology region,
2 PKC phosphorylation sites, and a tyrosine kinase phosphorylation site.
RT-PCR analysis of 16 metastatic HCC tissues paired with 16 primary HCC
tissues showed downregulation of PPAPDC1B expression in 11 of 16
metastatic lesions compared to primary HCC tissues, with 9 of 16
metastatic lesions showing significant downregulation of PPAPDC1B (P
less than 0.05).

GENE FUNCTION

Using in vitro matrigel assays, Wu et al. (2006) showed that
PPAPDC1B-transfected metastatic HCC cells showed significantly lower
invasion activity. Transfection and expression of PPAPDC1B in nude mice
bearing human HCC significantly decreased the incidence and degree of
pulmonary metastasis of HCC.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Wu et al. (2006) mapped the PPAPDC1B gene
to chromosome 8p12.

159460	TITLE *159460 MYELIN-ASSOCIATED GLYCOPROTEIN; MAG
;;SIALIC ACID-BINDING IMMUNOGLOBULIN-LIKE LECTIN 4A; SIGLEC4A
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), a membrane protein of 100 kD, is
thought to be involved in the process of myelination (Barton et al.,
1987). MAG is a sialic acid-binding SIGLEC (see 604200) protein and is a
functional ligand for the NOGO receptor (NGR, or RTN4R; 605566) (Liu et
al., 2002).

CLONING

Spagnol et al. (1989) found that MAG cDNA clones isolated from a human
brain cDNA library had an open reading frame of 1,878 nucleotides
encoding a peptide of 626 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight
of 69.1 kD.

Using a fragment of mouse Mag cDNA to screen a human brain lambda gt11
library, Sato et al. (1989) cloned MAG. The deduced 626-amino acid
protein has an N-terminal signal sequence and a C-terminal transmembrane
domain. The putative extracellular domain contains 9 potential
N-glycosylation sites and a fibronectin (135600) recognition sequence
(arg-gly-asp), and the putative intracellular domain has a tyrosine
phosphorylation site. Sato et al. (1989) also identified a splice
variant that includes exon 12. They noted that in mouse brain, the Mag
mRNA lacking exon 12 is expressed mainly during active myelination,
while the form containing exon 12 is expressed mainly in adult. The Mag
variant containing exon 12 encodes a smaller protein that lacks the
cytoplasmic phosphorylation site. Northern blot analysis of mouse,
bovine, and human RNA detected a 2,5-kb MAG transcript.

Using quantitative RT-PCR, Lauriat et al. (2008) found that expression
of the S-MAG and L-MAG variants, which contain and lack exon 12,
respectively, was very low in fetal human prefrontal cortex. However,
expression of both variants showed a gradual and linear increase with
age into adulthood (up to 46 years of age). Expression of S-MAG and
L-MAG also showed a gradual increase with age in hippocampus, although
expression appeared to level off in adulthood.

GENE FUNCTION

Axonal regeneration in the adult central nervous system is limited by 2
proteins in myelin, NOGO (604475) and MAG. The receptor for NOGO (NgR)
had been identified as an axonal glycosylphosphatidylinositol
(GPI)-anchored protein, whereas the MAG receptor had remained elusive.
Liu et al. (2002) demonstrated that MAG binds directly, with high
affinity, to NgR. Cleavage of GPI-linked proteins from axons protects
growth cones from MAG-induced collapse, and dominant-negative NgR
eliminates MAG inhibition of neurite outgrowth. MAG-resistant embryonic
neurons were rendered MAG-sensitive by expression of NgR. MAG and the
extracellular domain of NOGO (NOGO-66) activate NgR independently and
serve as redundant NgR ligands that may limit axonal regeneration after
CNS injury.

Domeniconi et al. (2002) showed that MAG inhibits axonal regeneration
through interaction with NgR. They demonstrated that MAG binds
specifically to an NgR-expressing cell line in a GPI-dependent and
sialic acid-independent manner. Consistent with a direct interaction of
MAG and NgR, Domeniconi et al. (2002) observed that MAG precipitates NgR
from NgR-expressing cells, dorsal root ganglia, and cerebellar neurons.
Experiments blocking NgR from interacting with MAG prevented inhibition
of neurite outgrowth by MAG. Using NgR-expressing cell cultures, the
authors found that MAG and NOGO-66 compete directly for binding to NgR.

Wong et al. (2002) reported that p75(NTR) (NGFR; 162010) is a coreceptor
for the NOGO receptor for MAG signaling. In cultured human embryonic
kidney (HEK) cells expressing the NOGO receptor, p75(NTR) was required
for MAG-induced intracellular calcium elevation. Coimmunoprecipitation
showed an association of the NOGO receptor with p75(NTR) that could be
disrupted by an antibody against p75(NTR), and extensive coexpression
was observed in the developing rat nervous system. Furthermore, a
p75(NTR) antibody abolished MAG-induced repulsive turning of Xenopus
axonal growth cones and calcium elevation, both in neurons and in the
NOGO receptor/p75(NTR)-expressing HEK cells.

Using expression cloning, Atwal et al. (2008) found that paired
immunoglobulin-like receptor B (PIRB; 604820), which has been implicated
in nervous system plasticity, is a high-affinity receptor for NOGO, MAG,
and OMGP (164345). Interfering with PIRB activity, either with
antibodies or genetically, partially rescued neurite inhibition by
NOGO66, MAG, OMGP, and myelin in cultured neurons. Blocking both PIRB
and NGR activities led to near-complete release from myelin inhibition.
Atwal et al. (2008) concluded that their results implicated PIRB in
mediating regeneration block, identified PIRB as a potential target for
axon regeneration therapies, and provided an explanation for the similar
enhancements of visual system plasticity in PIRB and NGR knockout mice.

Quaking (QKI; 609590) proteins bind RNA and regulate splicing,
intracellular localization, stability, and translation. Using
quantitative RT-PCR, Lauriat et al. (2008) found no L-Mag and
substantially reduced S-Mag in brains of qk(e5) mice, which show
decreased expression of all 3 Qki isoforms. Lauriat et al. (2008)
suggested that QKI may be required for MAG expression.

MAPPING

Using a cDNA encoding the amino-terminal half of rat MAG, Barton et al.
(1987) assigned the MAG locus to human chromosome 19 in studies of
somatic cell hybrids. The homologous locus was found to be located on
mouse chromosome 7.

By study of sorted chromosomes, Spagnol et al. (1989) assigned the MAG
gene to chromosome 19 and regionalized the assignment to 19q12-q13.2 by
restriction enzyme analysis of somatic cell hybrid DNA containing only
that region.

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Trask et al. (1993) assigned the
MAG gene to 19q13.1.

602731	TITLE *602731 FYN-BINDING PROTEIN; FYB
;;SLAP130;;
p120/130;;
ADHESION AND DEGRANULATION ADAPTOR PROTEIN; ADAP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

T-cell receptor signaling involves activation of the src
protein-tyrosine kinases LCK (153390) and FYN (137025), leading to the
phosphorylation of various substrates including SLP76 (LCP2; 601603). Da
Silva et al. (1993) identified FYB (called p120/130 by them), a 120- and
130-kD protein doublet that associates with the SH2 domain of FYN.
T-cell receptor ligation led to increased tyrosine phosphorylation of
FYB. Da Silva et al. (1997) showed that the 120- and 130-kD doublet is
composed of 2 related isoforms of FYB. In T cells from FYN mutant mice,
the phosphorylation of FYB was reduced, but not abolished, suggesting to
da Silva et al. (1997) that FYB could be phosphorylated by another
kinase. By screening a Jurkat T-cell line expression library with
antibodies against FYB, da Silva et al. (1997) identified FYB cDNAs.
Northern blot analysis revealed that the 4.5-kb FYB mRNA is expressed
only in myeloid and T cells. Expression of FYB in mammalian cells
yielded a protein that migrated at 120 kD on SDS-PAGE. By Western
blotting, da Silva et al. (1997B) showed that FYB coimmunoprecipitated
with FYN and with SLP76 in mammalian cell lysates. They concluded that
FYB acts as a component of the FYN and SLP76 signaling cascades in T
cells.

Musci et al. (1997) cloned cDNAs encoding SLAP130, a 130-kD
phosphoprotein that is associated with SLP76. Da Silva et al. (1997)
stated that SLAP130 is identical to FYB except for 2 conservative and 1
nonconservative amino acid substitutions. Musci et al. (1997) attributed
the difference between the calculated mass of SLAP130 (86 kD) and the
observed mass by SDS-PAGE (130 kD) to posttranslational modifications or
the abundance of charged amino acids.

Da Silva et al. (1997) used the human FYB cDNA to clone the mouse
homolog. The sequence of the predicted 783-amino acid human FYB protein
shares 77% identity with that of mouse FYB.

GENE FUNCTION

By immunoblot analysis, Geng et al. (2001) showed that FCER1A (147140)
aggregation induces rapid FYB tyrosine phosphorylation in rat basophilic
leukemia mast cells and the release of beta hexosaminidase (see 606873).
Confocal microscopy demonstrated that FYB colocalizes with actin (see
ACTA1; 102610) in membrane ruffles. FYB overexpression enhanced mast
cell adhesion to fibronectin (FN1; 135600) and SH3 domain-mediated
release of beta hexosaminidase, implying increased histamine release as
well. Mast cell adhesion had no effect on FYB phosphorylation but
enhanced beta hexosaminidase release.

Medeiros et al. (2007) presented evidence for a previously unrecognized
function for ADAP in regulating T-cell receptor (TCR)-mediated
activation of the transcription factor NF-kappa-B (see 164011).
Stimulation of ADAP-deficient mouse T cells with antibodies to CD3 (see
186740) and CD28 (186760) resulted in impaired nuclear translocation of
NF-kappa-B, a reduced DNA binding, and delayed degradation and decreased
phosphorylation of I-kappa-B (see 164008). TCR-stimulated assembly of
the CARMA1 (607210)-BCL10 (603517)-MALT1 (604860) complex was
substantially impaired in the absence of ADAP. Medeiros et al. (2007)
further identified a region of ADAP that is required for association
with the CARMA1 adaptor and NF-kappa-B activation but is not required
for ADAP-dependent regulation of adhesion.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using gene targeting strategies, Griffiths et al. (2001) and Peterson et
al. (2001) each generated mice lacking Fyb expression in mature T
lymphocytes. Although lymphocyte development was normal in these mice,
splenic CD4 (186940)-positive and CD8 (see 186910)-positive T-cell
numbers were reduced, suggesting that Fyb may be required for peripheral
T-cell homeostasis. T-cell proliferation in response to phorbol ester
was normal in Fyb-deficient cells, but responses to anti-CD3E (186830),
with or without anti-CD28 (186760), were reduced, as were cytokine
production and activation marker upregulation. These results
demonstrated that Fyb acts as a positive regulator of T-cell activation.
Fyb-deficient mice also had reduced antibody production to T-dependent
antigens in vivo. Although downstream signaling pathways and antigen
receptor clustering were normal, clustering of the integrin LFA1 (see
153370 and 600065) was not. Flow chamber analysis demonstrated that
anti-CD3E-stimulated but not phorbol ester-stimulated Fyb-deficient T
cells were defective in adhering to mouse Icam1 (147840), to human ICAM2
(146630), and to other substrates mediated by integrins, although
integrin expression was not reduced. Using confocal microscopy, Peterson
et al. (2001) showed that Fyb-deficient T cells had normal clustering of
actin but no polarization of LFA1, whereas LFA1 clustering was markedly
increased in wildtype T cells. Griffiths et al. (2001) concluded that
the T-cell receptor-induced adhesion defect in integrin activation was
due to a block in 'inside-out' signaling between the T-cell receptor and
integrins. Peterson et al. (2001) and Griffiths et al. (2001) proposed
that on the basis of these findings and studies by Geng et al. (2001),
which implicated FYB in vasoactive mediator release, that FYB be
redesignated 'adhesion and degranulation adaptor protein,' or ADAP.

609862	TITLE *609862 TRANSMEMBRANE PROTEASE, SERINE 6; TMPRSS6
;;MATRIPTASE 2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The TMPRSS6 gene encodes matriptase-2, a serine protease that represses
hepcidin (HAMP; 606464) expression by cleaving membrane-bound
hemojuvelin (HJV; 608374), among other functions (summary by Silvestri
et al., 2009).

CLONING

Using BLAST analysis of human genomic sequence with the sequences of
serine proteinases as query, Velasco et al. (2002) identified a novel
homologous sequence. They subsequently used PCR amplification of a human
fetal liver cDNA library to isolate a full-length clone of TMPRSS6,
which they named matriptase-2. TMPRSS6 encodes an 802-amino acid protein
with a predicted molecular mass of 88.9 kD. The protein shares 35%
sequence identity with human matriptase/ST14 (606797) and
spinesin/TMPRSS5 (606751), and 84.3% identity with mouse Tmprss6. It
contains structural features characteristic of type II serine
proteinases, including a short hydrophobic domain, a type II
transmembrane sequence, 2 CUB domains, 3 LDL receptor repeats, and a
C-terminal catalytic domain with structural hallmarks of serine
proteinases. A potential phosphorylation domain is present at the
cytoplasmic tail. Sequence alignment of the catalytic domains of TMPRSS6
and other type II serine proteinase family members permitted the
identification of several conserved domains. Northern blot analysis of
multiple human tissues revealed expression of a 3.5-kb TMPRSS6
transcript exclusively in fetal and adult liver. Immunofluorescence and
Western blot analysis of COS-7 cells transfected with TMPRSS6 showed
that TMPRSS6 localizes to the cell membrane.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ramsay et al. (2009) noted that the TMPRSS6 gene contains 18 exons.

MAPPING

Velasco et al. (2002) identified the TMPRSS6 gene within a contig
mapping to chromosome 22q12-q13.

GENE FUNCTION

Using purified recombinant TMPRSS6 protein, Velasco et al. (2002) showed
that TMPRSS6 hydrolyzes a variety of synthetic substrates as well as the
endogenous proteins fibronectin (135600), fibrinogen (see 134820), and
type I collagen (see 120150). The serine protease inhibitor
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride inhibits TMPRSS6 enzymatic activity.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In studies of 5 multiplex kindreds with iron-refractory iron deficiency
anemia (IRIDA; 206200), in which anemia is unresponsive to oral iron
therapy but partially responsive to parenteral iron administration,
Finberg et al. (2008) established linkage to 22q12-q13 and demonstrated
sequence variants in each of the kindreds in the TMPRSS6 gene. Affected
individuals harbored frameshift mutations, splice junction mutations, or
missense mutations altering residues conserved in TMPRSS6 homologs from
humans to fugu (609862.0001-609862.0008). In 3 kindreds biallelic
mutations were found; in the other 2, a second mutation undetected by
sequencing could not be excluded. Biallelic mutations were also found in
2 sporadic cases. All of the TMPRSS6 mutations lay distal to exon 8, in
regions that encode several conserved structural domains, most notably a
trypsin-like serine protease domain. Inappropriately elevated levels of
urinary hepcidin (606464) were found in individuals with IRIDA.

Guillem et al. (2008) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 nonsense
mutations in the TMPRSS6 gene (609862.0009 and 609862.0010) in a patient
with IRIDA, confirming the findings of Finberg et al. (2008). Hepcidin
levels were inappropriately normal in the patient reported by Guillem et
al. (2008), suggesting defective hepcidin downregulation.

Ramsay et al. (2009) identified compound heterozygosity for mutation in
the TMPRSS6 gene (609862.0011 and 609862.0012) in monozygotic Spanish
twin girls exhibiting an IRIDA phenotype.

Guillem et al. (2012) found that transfection of Huh7 hemochromatosis
cells with missense TMPRSS6 mutations (E114K, L235P, Y418C, and P765A)
identified in IRIDA patients retained the ability to repress the HAMP
promoter, although to a lesser degree than wildtype. However, the
mutants showed undetectable levels of protease activity and were unable
to autocleave and form the activated 30-kD TMPRSS6 fragment. The
findings suggested that these missense mutations may induce a change in
protein conformation that reduces the accessibility of the cleavage site
necessary for activation of the TMPRSS6 zymogen. Guillem et al. (2012)
suggested that the hepcidin repression assay used to assess the
functional relevance of TMPRSS6 mutations should be interpreted with
caution. However, Silvestri et al. (2013) found that transfection of the
4 missense mutations identified by Guillem et al. (2012) into Hep3B
cells resulted in an impaired ability to repress HJV-dependent hepcidin
activation. Silvestri et al. (2013) concluded that there is no simple
method to assess the function of TMPRSS6 variants, and that measuring
serum hepcidin in patients may be a better test.

For a discussion of association between variation in the TMPRSS6 gene
and hemoglobin levels as a quantitative trait, see 613284.

ANIMAL MODEL

Du et al. (2008) described 'mask': a recessive, chemically induced
mutant mouse phenotype characterized by progressive loss of body (but
not facial) hair and microcytic anemia. The mask phenotype results from
reduced absorption of dietary iron caused by high levels of hepcidin and
is due to a splicing defect in the transmembrane serine protease-6 gene
Tmprss6. The authors demonstrated that overexpression of normal TMPRSS6
protein suppresses activation of the Hamp promoter and that the TMPRSS6
cytoplasmic domain mediates Hamp suppression via proximal promoter
element(s). Du et al. (2008) concluded that TMPRSS6 is an essential
component of a pathway that detects iron deficiency and blocks Hamp
transcription, permitting enhanced dietary iron absorption.

Lenoir et al. (2011) found that double knockout of Bmp6 (112266) and
Tmprss6 in mice rescued the iron deficiency anemia observed in Tmprss6
-/- mice, although hepcidin expression was repressed to the same extent
as in Bmp6 -/- mice. Heterozygous loss of Bmp6 in Tmprss6 -/- mice
partly corrected systemic iron homeostasis by decreasing hepcidin gene
expression and increasing plasma and liver iron levels. Lenoir et al.
(2011) concluded that BMP6 is the physiologic ligand of HJV and that
regulation of HJV membrane expression by TMPRSS6 tightly controls BMP6
signaling.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
IRON-REFRACTORY IRON DEFICIENCY ANEMIA
TMPRSS6, 2-BP INS, 1906GC

In a consanguineous Turkish family with iron-refractory iron deficiency
anemia (IRIDA; 206200), Finberg et al. (2008) found homozygosity for a
2-bp insertion in the TMPRSS6 gene, 1906_1907insGC, which resulted in
frameshift beginning at lys636 in the protease domain (K636fs).

.0002
IRON-REFRACTORY IRON DEFICIENCY ANEMIA
TMPRSS6, 1-BP DEL, 1813G

In a northern European family with IRIDA (206200), Finberg et al. (2008)
detected compound heterozygosity for a 1-bp deletion in the TMPRSS6 gene
resulting in frameshift beginning in the protease domain of the protein
(1813delG, A605fs), and a splice-site mutation (609862.0003).

.0003
IRON-REFRACTORY IRON DEFICIENCY ANEMIA
TMPRSS6, IVS13, G-A, +1

On 1 allele of the TMPRSS6 gene in a northern European family with IRIDA
(206200), Finberg et al. (2008) found a splice-site mutation in intron
13 of the TMPRSS6 gene, IVS13G-A+1. The other allele carried a 1-bp
deletion (609862.0002).

.0004
IRON-REFRACTORY IRON DEFICIENCY ANEMIA
TMPRSS6, IVS16, G-C, +1

In a nonconsanguineous Nigerian family with IRIDA (206200), Finberg et
al. (2008) detected a splice-site mutation in intron 16 of the TMPRSS6
gene on the paternal allele (IVS16G-C+1). The presence of a mutation
undetectable by sequencing, such as a large deletion, on the maternal
allele was not excluded.

.0005
IRON-REFRACTORY IRON DEFICIENCY ANEMIA
TMPRSS6, GLY442ARG

In a nonconsanguineous northern European family with iron-refractory
iron deficiency anemia (IRIDA; 206200), Finberg et al. (2008) found
compound heterozygosity for mutations in the TMPRSS6 gene. One allele
carried a G-to-A transition at nucleotide 1324 that caused a
substitution of arg for gly (G442R) in the CUB (complement factor
C1r/C1s, urchin embryonic growth factor, and bone morphogenetic protein)
domain. The other allele also carried a missense mutation (609862.0006).

By in vitro functional expression studies in HeLa cells, Silvestri et
al. (2009) demonstrated that the G442R-mutant protein was targeted
normally to the plasma membrane but was only partially effective in
cleaving membrane-bound hemojuvelin (HJV; 608374) despite a detectable
physical interaction with HJV. Hepcidin (HAMP; 606464) expression was
only partially repressed by the G442R-mutant protein compared to
wildtype protein.

.0006
IRON-REFRACTORY IRON DEFICIENCY ANEMIA
TMPRSS6, ASP521ASN

In a northern European family with IRIDA (206200), Finberg et al. (2008)
found a 1561G-A transition in exon 13 of the TMPRSS6 gene, resulting in
an asp521-to-asn (D521N) substitution in the LDLRA domain (LDL receptor
class A) of the protein. On the other allele another missense mutation
was found (609862.0005).

Silvestri et al. (2009) found compound heterozygosity for the D531N
mutation and an E522K mutation (609862.0013) in a French boy with IRIDA.
By in vitro functional expression studies in HeLa cells, Silvestri et
al. (2009) demonstrated that the D521N-mutant protein was partially
retained in the Golgi apparatus and had low expression at the plasma
membrane. The mutant protein was ineffective in cleaving membrane-bound
HJV, despite a detectable physical interaction with HJV. Hepcidin
expression was only partially repressed by the D521N-mutant protein
compared to wildtype protein.

.0007
IRON-REFRACTORY IRON DEFICIENCY ANEMIA
TMPRSS6, TYR355TER

In an African American individual with a sporadic case of IRIDA
(206200), Finberg et al. (2008) found compound heterozygosity for
mutations in the TMPRSS6 gene. One allele carried a 1065C-A transversion
resulting in premature termination at codon 355 in the CUB domain of the
protein (Y355X). The other allele carried a frameshift mutation
(609862.0008).

.0008
IRON-REFRACTORY IRON DEFICIENCY ANEMIA
TMPRSS6, 1-BP DEL, 1383A

In an African American individual with a sporadic case of IRIDA
(206200), Finberg et al. (2008) detected a 1-bp deletion in the TMPRSS6
gene, 1383delA, resulting in frameshift beginning in the LDLRA domain of
the protein (E461fs). On the other allele a nonsense mutation was found
(609862.0007).

.0009
IRON-REFRACTORY IRON DEFICIENCY ANEMIA
TMPRSS6, TYR393TER

In an 18-month-old boy with IRIDA (206200), Guillem et al. (2008)
identified compound heterozygosity for mutation in the TMPRSS6 gene: a
1179T-G transversion in exon 10, resulting in a tyr393-to-ter (Y393X)
substitution, and a 1795C-T transition in exon 15, resulting in an
arg599-to-ter (R599X; 609862.0010) substitution. He responded clinically
to intravenous iron therapy after unsuccessful oral iron therapy.
Hepcidin (606464) levels were inappropriately normal in the patient,
suggesting defective hepcidin downregulation. Of note, the patient had a
dizygotic twin sister who was unaffected and heterozygous for the R599X
mutation.

.0011
IRON-REFRACTORY IRON DEFICIENCY ANEMIA
TMPRSS6, 4-BP INS, 2172CCCC

Ramsay et al. (2009) described monozygotic Spanish twin girls with IRIDA
(206200) who were compound heterozygous for a 4-bp insertion
(ins2172CCCC) in exon 16 of the TMPRSS6 gene, resulting in a frameshift
and predicted to terminate translation before the catalytic serine
residue, and a dinucleotide substitution, 467C-A and 468C-T, in exon 3
of the TMPRSS6 gene, resulting in an ala118-to-asp (A118D) substitution
in the SEA domain of the extracellular stem region. Functional analysis
of both variant matriptase-2 proteases showed ineffective suppression of
hepcidin transcription. The A118D mutation caused an intramolecular
structural imbalance that impaired matriptase-2 activation. Ramsay et
al. (2009) concluded that mutations affecting protease regions other
than the catalytic domain may have a profound impact in the regulatory
role of matriptase-2 during iron deficiency.

IRON-REFRACTORY IRON DEFICIENCY ANEMIA
TMPRSS6, GLU522LYS

In a French boy with iron-refractory iron deficiency anemia (206200),
Silvestri et al. (2009) identified compound heterozygosity for 2
mutations in the TMPRSS6 gene: D521N (609862.0006) and a 1564G-A
transition in exon 13, resulting in a glu522-to-lys (E522K)
substitution. Both mutations were predicted to affect the LDLRA domain.
By in vitro functional expression studies in HeLa cells, Silvestri et
al. (2009) demonstrated that the E522K-mutant protein was partially
retained in the Golgi apparatus and had low expression at the plasma
membrane. The mutant protein was ineffective in cleaving membrane-bound
hemojuvelin (HJV; 608374), despite a detectable physical interaction
with HJV. Hepcidin (HAMP; 606464) expression was only partially
repressed by the E522K-mutant protein compared to wildtype protein.

608010	TITLE +608010 NPC1-LIKE 1; NPC1L1
EZETIMIBE, NONRESPONSE TO, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

NPC1L1 is a 13-transmembrane domain cell surface cholesterol-sensing
receptor. It is expressed on the apical surface of intestinal
enterocytes and hepatocytes and is responsible for cellular cholesterol
absorption and whole-body cholesterol homeostasis (summary by Sainz et
al., 2012).

CLONING

By EST database searching with fragments of the NPC1 (607623) protein
sequence, Davies et al. (2000) identified a weakly similar EST that they
used to assemble a novel full-length human cDNA, designated NPC1L1.
NPC1L1 encodes a deduced 1,359-amino acid protein. Two alternatively
spliced transcripts encode truncated proteins, one with 724 amino acids
(NPC1L1T) and the other with a 27-amino acid in-frame deletion
(NPC1L1delE15). The NPC1L1 protein shares 42% sequence identity with
NPC1. Both proteins contain a conserved N-terminal NPC1 domain and a
putative sterol-sensing domain, but have different putative
intracellular targeting signals. NPC1 has a C-terminal dileucine
targeting motif that had been implicated in trafficking to the
endosomal/lysosomal system, whereas NPC1L1 has a YQRL motif, which had
been shown to function as a plasma membrane to trans-Golgi network
transport signal in other proteins. Northern blot analysis detected
ubiquitous expression of a major 5-kb and a minor 2.4-kb NPC1L1
transcript, with highest expression in liver, lung, and pancreas.

Altmann et al. (2004) found that in human, mouse, and rat, small
intestine showed the highest level of NPC1L1 mRNA expression. They also
observed expression in other tissues, including gallbladder, liver,
testis, and stomach.

Ge et al. (2011) noted that in humans, NPC1L1 is highly expressed in
small intestine and liver, whereas in mouse and rat, it is highly
expressed in intestine, but not liver.

GENE STRUCTURE

Davies et al. (2000) determined that the NPC1L1 gene contains 20 exons,
with an unusually large 1,526-bp exon 2, and spans approximately 29 kb.
Its putative promoter region contains a sterol-regulatory element (SRE)
for SRE-binding protein (184756), suggesting that NPC1L1 may have a role
in subcellular cholesterol homeostasis.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid analysis, Davies et al. (2000) mapped the NPC1L1
gene to chromosome 7. They regionalized the gene to chromosome 7p13 by
FISH.

GENE FUNCTION

Davies et al. (2000) presented data suggesting that NPC1L1 is involved
in subcellular cholesterol trafficking.

Altmann et al. (2004) demonstrated that NPC1L1 protein plays a critical
role in the absorption of intestinal cholesterol. NPC1L1 expression was
enriched in the small intestine and in the brush border membrane of
enterocytes. Although otherwise phenotypically normal, Npc1l1-deficient
mice exhibited a substantial reduction in absorbed cholesterol that was
unaffected by dietary supplementation of bile acids. Ezetimibe, a drug
that inhibits cholesterol absorption, had no effect on Npc1l1-knockout
mice, suggesting that NPC1L1 resides in an ezetimibe-sensitive pathway
responsible for intestinal cholesterol absorption.

Garcia-Calvo et al. (2005) confirmed that ezetimibe glucuronide binds
specifically to a single site in mammalian enterocyte brush border
membranes and to human embryonic kidney cells expressing NPC1L1.

As observed with other hepatitis C virus (HCV; see 609532) entry
factors, Sainz et al. (2012) found that NPC1L1 expression was
downregulated on a human hepatocyte cell line following HCV infection.
Blocking NPC1L1 via small interfering RNA or antibody treatment reduced
susceptibility to HCV infection, but not vesicular stomatitis virus
infection. Ezetimibe treatment also reduced susceptibility to HCV
infection by directly inhibiting viral entry after receptor binding and
at or before fusion. Sainz et al. (2012) concluded that NPC1L1 is an HCV
cell entry factor and a potential antiviral target.

FLOT1 (606998) and FLOT2 (131560) are lipid raft proteins. Using a human
liver cell line, rat liver cells expressing human NPC1L1, and transgenic
mice, Ge et al. (2011) found that NPC1L1 required FLOT1 and FLOT2 for
bulk endocytosis of cholesterol-enriched plasma membrane microdomains.
NPC1L1 interacted directly with FLOT1 and FLOT2, which functioned
upstream of clathrin (see 118955) in NPC1L1 cholesterol uptake. The
flotillins had no effect on recycling NPC1L1 to plasma membranes. In
addition, ezetimibe disrupted NPC1L1-flotillin interactions, blocking
formation of cholesterol-enriched microdomains.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Dog Npc1l1 has a much higher binding affinity for ezetimibe than mouse
Npc1l1. Using mass spectrometry to compare ezetimibe binding by
recombinant dog and mouse Npc1l1, Weinglass et al. (2008) localized the
high-affinity ezetimibe-binding site to a large extracellular domain
(loop C) in dog Npc1l1. Mutation analysis revealed residues critical for
ezetimibe binding adjacent to a hotspot of human polymorphisms
associated with reduced cholesterol absorption. Given that cholesterol
binds to the N terminus (loop A) of NPC1, a close homolog of NPC1L1,
Weinglass et al. (2008) hypothesized that ezetimibe binding prevents a
conformational change in NPC1L1 that is required for translocation of
cholesterol across membranes.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Wang et al. (2004) used the nonresponse phenotype of plasma LDL
cholesterol to ezetimibe treatment to ascertain individuals who might
have variant NPC1L1. Of 8 nonresponders, 1 was found to be a compound
heterozygote for 2 rare nonsynonymous polymorphisms in NPC1L1 (see
608010.0001 and 608010.0002) that were absent in 278 normal controls.

Simon et al. (2005) genotyped the NPC1L1 gene in hypercholesterolemic
individuals from clinical trial cohorts and healthy individuals and
found no association between NPC1L1 SNPs and baseline cholesterol level.
Significant associations between LDL cholesterol response and treatment
with ezetimibe were observed in 2 large clinical trials; the authors
noted that the SNPs identified in this study were unlikely to represent
causal variants, however, given that no single SNP was found to support
the full magnitude of the effect.

Chen et al. (2009) screened the NPC1L1 gene in 50 Chinese individuals
and identified a genomic -762C-T promoter polymorphism (dbSNP rs2073548)
that was found in 34% of individuals. Luciferase assay in the HepG2 cell
line showed that the -762C allele had significantly higher promoter
activity than -762T (3.5-fold, p = 0.05), and that NPC1L1 promoter
activity was downregulated by cholesterol content in a dose-dependent
manner in both genotypes. Association analysis in 224 Chinese
individuals revealed that the -762C allele was associated with
significantly higher serum total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol content
levels in a recessive model (p less than 0.05).

Teslovich et al. (2010) performed a genomewide association study for
plasma lipids in more than 100,000 individuals of European ancestry and
reported 95 significantly associated loci (P = less than 5 x 10(-8)),
with 59 showing genomewide significant association with lipid traits for
the first time. The newly reported associations included SNPs near known
lipid regulators (e.g., CYP7A1, 118455; NPC1L1; and SCARB1, 601040) as
well as in scores of loci not previously implicated in lipoprotein
metabolism. The 95 loci contributed not only to normal variation in
lipid traits but also to extreme lipid phenotypes and had an impact on
lipid traits in 3 non-European populations (East Asians, South Asians,
and African Americans).

Altmann et al. (2004) characterized Npc1l1-null mice. Deficiency of
Npc1l1 appeared to have no effect on development, fertility, or any
hematologic or plasma parameters. Intestinal morphology was normal in
the null mice, with no lipid accumulation in enterocytes.

In an individual with hyperlipidemia who did not respond to treatment
with ezetimibe, Wang et al. (2004) identified compound heterozygosity
for 2 rare polymorphisms of the NPC1L1 gene: a 219G-to-T transversion in
exon 2, resulting in a val55-to-leu (V55L) substitution; and a
3754T-to-A transversion in exon 18, resulting in an ile1233-to-asn

611086	TITLE *611086 FORKHEAD BOX D4-LIKE 3; FOXD4L3
;;FOXD4-LIKE 3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By examining genes arising from intra- and interchromosomal duplications
involving the ancestral chromosome 2 fusion site, Fan et al. (2002)
identified FOXD4L1 (611084), FOXD4L2 (611085), and FOXD4L3. The deduced
417-amino acid FOXD4L3 protein contains a central forkhead domain.

GENE STRUCTURE

Fan et al. (2002) determined that FOXD4L3 is a single-exon gene, and
they identified a TATA box in the promoter region.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Fan et al. (2002) mapped the FOXD4L3 gene
to chromosome 9q13.

611450	TITLE *611450 PXK DOMAIN-CONTAINING SERINE/THREONINE KINASE; PXK
;;MODULATOR OF Na,K-ATPase; MONAKA
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

PXK binds to the Na,K-ATPase beta-1 (ATP1B1; 182330) and beta-3 (ATP1B3;
601867) subunits and modulates both Na,K-ATPase enzymatic and ion pump
activities (Mao et al., 2005).

CLONING

Mao et al. (2005) cloned mouse and human PXK, which they called MONAKA,
based on their sequence similarity to Drosophila slob, a protein that
binds the Drosophila 'slowpoke' calcium-dependent potassium channel
(KCNMA1; 600150). The deduced 578-amino acid human PXK and 581-amino
acid mouse Pxk share over 90% amino acid identity. PXK contains an
N-terminal PX-like domain predicted to bind phosphoinositides, a
putative protein kinase domain in the central region, which has greatest
similarity to Drosophila slob, and a number of polyproline motifs. The
authors identified a truncated PXK isoform in both human and mouse.
RT-PCR analysis detected expression of the full-length Pxk in all mouse
tissues examined and expression of the Pxk short isoform in all mouse
tissues except skeletal muscle. Immunohistochemical studies detected Pxk
expression throughout the nervous system in both mouse neurons and glia,
including oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, microglia, and Schwann cells. In
neurons, Pxk localized to the cytoplasm in both the cell body and axon.
Semiquantitative PCR showed more full-length Pxk than short PxK in glial
cells, whereas neurons had the opposite expression ratio. Western blot
analysis and biotinylation labeling of mouse brain subcellular fractions
localized Pxk to both the membrane and cytoplasm fractions and suggested
that some of the Pxk protein may be membrane bound.

By screening a human fetal brain cDNA library, Zou et al. (2005)
isolated 4 PXK splice variants, which differed in the N terminus but
were identical in the central protein kinase and C-terminal region.
RT-PCR analysis detected expression of full-length PXK, which they
called PXKv1, at high levels in brain, skeletal muscle, spleen, and
testis, moderate levels in pancreas, and low levels in placenta, lung,
liver, kidney, thymus, prostate, ovary, small intestine, colon, and
peripheral blood leukocytes. PXKv2 and PXKv4 were detected at low levels
in all adult human tissues examined except for heart. Splice variant
PXKv3 expression was detected in peripheral blood leukocytes, and PXKv5
expression was not detected. Immunofluorescence localized PXKv1, PXKv2,
PXKv4, and PXKv5 to the cytoplasm, while PXKv3 was distributed
throughout the cell. Using PXKv1 mutants, they showed that tyr52 and
arg92 are required for subcellular localization to the cytoplasm.

GENE FUNCTION

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis, coimmunoprecipitation, and GST pull-down
assays of mouse astrocytes and brain tissue, Mao et al. (2005) showed
that mouse Pxk long and short isoforms bind the glycosylated and
nonglycosylated forms of Na,K-ATPase beta-1 and beta-3 subunits. By
addition of purified GST-Pxk protein to mouse brain Na,K-ATPase, they
showed that Pxk inhibited ATPase activity by 30 to 38%. In transfected
TSA201 cells, both long and short Pxk isoforms reduced 86Rb(+) uptake.
Mao et al. (2005) concluded that Pxk regulates Na,K-ATPase ion transport
activity.

GENE STRUCTURE

Zou et al. (2005) determined that the PXK gene contains at least 19
exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Zou et al. (2005) mapped the PXK gene to
chromosome 3p14.3.

607878	TITLE *607878 NICOTINAMIDE NUCLEOTIDE TRANSHYDROGENASE; NNT
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

NNT is a pyridine nucleotide transhydrogenase (EC 1.6.1.1). These
integral inner mitochondrial membrane proteins are part of the
energy-transfer system of the respiratory chain and catalyze the
transfer of a hydride ion between nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide,
NAD(H), and oxidized nicotinamide dinucleotide phosphate, NADP(H)
(summary by Zieger and Ware, 1997).

CLONING

Using bovine Nnt as probe, Arkblad et al. (1996) cloned NNT from a heart
cDNA library, and they cloned mouse Nnt from a mouse liver cDNA library.
The deduced 1,086-amino acid NNT protein has a 43-amino acid
presequence, 10 membrane-spanning alpha helices, and substrate-binding
sites for NAD(H) and NADP(H). It shares 97% amino acid identity with
bovine Nnt and 94% identity with mouse Nnt. A hypervariable region is
located in the first transmembrane helix, and the presequences are less
conserved.

Zieger and Ware (1997) cloned NNT from a cell line established from a
solid tumor in a patient with megakaryoblastic leukemia.

Meimaridou et al. (2012) found wide expression of NNT in humans, with
expression most readily detectable in adrenal, heart, kidney, thyroid,
and adipose tissues.

MAPPING

By FISH, Arkblad et al. (1997) mapped the NNT gene to chromosome
5p13.1-cen. They mapped the mouse Nnt gene to chromosome 13D2.

GENE FUNCTION

Meimaridou et al. (2012) studied the adrenal glands from Nnt-deficient
mice and observed slightly disorganized zonae fasciculatae with higher
levels of apoptosis than wildtype mice. There were no observable
differences in the levels of the steroidogenic enzymes CYP11A1 (118485)
and CYP11B1 (610613) between wildtype and mutant mice; however, the
mutant mice did have lower basal and stimulated levels of corticosterone
than their wildtype counterparts. Knockdown of NNT in the human
adrenocortical H295R cell line by short hairpin RNA not only increased
the levels of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and apoptosis but
also lowered the glutathione (GSH; see 601002)/glutathione disulfide
(GSSG) ratio, implying that these cells also have impaired redox
potential.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 3 kindreds with glucocorticoid deficiency mapping to chromosome
5p13-q12 (GCCD4; 614736), Meimaridou et al. (2012) identified
homozygosity for 3 different mutations in the NNT gene
(607878.0001-607878.0003) that segregated with disease in each family
and were not found in controls. Subsequent analysis of the NNT gene in
100 individuals with GCCD of unknown etiology revealed homozygosity or
compound heterozygosity for 18 more mutations in 12 kindreds (see, e.g.,
607878.0004-607878.0006). The mutations were spread throughout the NNT
gene and included a mutation that destroyed the translation-initiating
methionine, 2 additional splice site mutations, and many missense and
nonsense changes.

600662	TITLE *600662 MADS BOX TRANSCRIPTION ENHANCER FACTOR 2, POLYPEPTIDE C; MEF2C
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MEF2C belongs to the myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF2) family of
transcription factors. MEF2C plays a pivotal role in myogenesis,
development of the anterior heart field, neural crest and craniofacial
development, and neurogenesis, among others (summary by Zweier et al.,
2010).

See also MEF2A (600660).

CLONING

McDermott et al. (1993) cloned a member of the MEF2 family of proteins
from a human skeletal muscle cDNA library using a fragment of the MEF2A
cDNA as a probe. Transcripts of MEF2C were found in the skeletal muscle
and brain. Alternative splice variants were found, 1 of which was unique
to the brain.

Leifer et al. (1993) found that the brain form was expressed by neurons
in particular layers of the cerebral cortex and that expression declined
during postnatal development. The skeletal isoform of the cDNA encodes a
465-amino acid protein with conserved MADS and MEF2 domains. Like the
other MEF2 gene products, MEF2C has both DNA binding and
trans-activating activities indistinguishable from other members of the
family. MEF2C, however, is induced late during myogenic differentiation
and has a strict tissue-specific pattern of expression not seen in MEF2A
or MEF2B.

Zweier et al. (2010) found high expression of isoform 1 of the MEF2C
gene in fetal and adult human brain, whereas isoform 2 was widely
expressed with highest levels in skeletal muscle.

GENE FUNCTION

Breitbart et al. (1993) suggested that, while MEF2A may be involved in
induction of muscle differentiation, MEF2C may be involved with
maintenance of the differentiated state.

CREB-binding protein (CBP; 600140)/p300 (602700) and p300/CBP-associated
factor (PCAF; 602203) are coactivators for MEF2C during differentiation.
Chen et al. (2000) showed that NCOA2 mediates the coactivation of
MEF2C-dependent transcription through interaction with the MADS box
domain of MEF2C. They proposed a model of cooperative interaction
between NCOA2, myogenin (MYOG; 159980), and MEF2C in the regulation of
muscle-specific gene expression.

During mammalian development, electrical activity promotes the
calcium-dependent survival of neurons that have made appropriate
synaptic connections. Mao et al. (1999) showed that calcium influx into
cerebellar neurons triggers the activation of the MKK6 (601254)-p38 MAP
kinase (600289) cascade and that the p38 MAP kinase then phosphorylates
and activates MEF2s. Once activated by this calcium-dependent p38 MAP
kinase signaling pathway, MEF2 can regulate the expression of genes that
are critical for survival of newly differentiated neurons. These
findings demonstrated that MEF2 is a calcium-regulated transcription
factor and defined a function for MEF2 during nervous system development
that is distinct from previously well-characterized functions of MEF2
during muscle differentiation.

Chen et al. (2002) demonstrated that Carm1 (603934) and Ncoa2
cooperatively stimulated the activity of Mef2c in mouse mesenchymal stem
cells and found that there was direct interaction among Mef2c, Grip1,
and Carm1.

By targeting human MEF2A or mouse Mef2c expression to mouse
cardiomyocytes, Xu et al. (2006) demonstrated that overexpressing these
transcription factors caused cardiomyopathy or predisposed transgenic
mice to more fulminant disease following pressure overload. In cultured
cardiomyocytes, MEF2A or Mef2c overexpression induced sarcomeric
disorganization and focal elongation. Both MEF2A and Mef2c programmed
similar profiles of gene expression in the heart that included genes
involved in extracellular matrix remodeling, ion handling, and
metabolism.

Potthoff et al. (2007) showed that class II histone deacetylases (e.g.,
HDAC5; 605315) were selectively degraded by the proteasome in mouse
slow, oxidative myofibers, enabling Mef2 to activate the slow myofiber
gene program. Forced expression of Hdac5 in skeletal muscle or genetic
deletion of Mef2c or Mef2d (600663) blocked activity-dependent fast to
slow fiber transformation, whereas expression of hyperactive Mef2c
promoted the slow fiber phenotype, enhancing endurance and enabling mice
to run almost twice the distance of wildtype littermates.

Using a loss-of-function allele in mice, Johnnidis et al. (2008)
reported that the myeloid-specific microRNA-223 (miR223; 300694)
negatively regulates progenitor proliferation and granulocyte
differentiation and activation. miR223 mutant mice had an expanded
granulocytic compartment resulting from a cell-autonomous increase in
the number of granulocyte progenitors. Johnnidis et al. (2008) showed
that Mef2c, a transcription factor that promotes myeloid progenitor
proliferation, is a target of miR223, and that genetic ablation of Mef2c
suppresses progenitor expansion and corrects the neutrophilic phenotype
in miR223-null mice. In addition, granulocytes lacking miR223 were
hypermature, hypersensitive to activating stimuli, and displayed
increased fungicidal activity. As a consequence of this neutrophil
hyperactivity, miR223 mutant mice spontaneously developed inflammatory
lung pathology and exhibited exaggerated tissue destruction after
endotoxin challenge. Johnnidis et al. (2008) concluded that their data
supported a model in which miR223 acts as a fine tuner of granulocyte
production and the inflammatory response.

Zweier et al. (2010) demonstrated that MEF2C increases promoter
activation of the MECP2 (300005) and CDKL5 (300203) genes.

MAPPING

Martin et al. (1994) mapped Mef2 to mouse chromosome 13. By fluorescence
in situ hybridization, Krainc et al. (1995) mapped human MEF2C to
chromosome 5q14, a region with homology of synteny to the mouse
location.

CYTOGENETICS

In 5 unrelated children with severe mental retardation, stereotypic
movements, epilepsy, and/or cerebral malformations (613443), Le Meur et
al. (2010) identified 5 different interstitial de novo deletions of
chromosome 5q14 ranging in size from 216 kb to 8.8 Mb. The minimal
common deleted region contained only the MEF2C gene.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a girl with severe mental retardation, stereotypic movements,
epilepsy, and cerebral malformation (MRD20; 613443), Le Meur et al.
(2010) identified a de novo heterozygous nonsense mutation in the MEF2C
gene (S228X; 600662.0001). Le Meur et al. (2010) noted that the role of
MEF2C in synaptic plasticity is consistent with a role in learning and
memory, and the authors referred to the mouse models of Li et al. (2008)
and Barbosa et al. (2008).

Zweier et al. (2010) identified 4 different de novo heterozygous
mutations in the MEF2C gene (see. e.g., 600662.0002-600662.0004) in 4 of
362 probands with mental retardation who were screened for mutations in
this gene. Two of the mutations were missense and 2 were truncating. Two
additional patients with a similar disorder had heterozygous deletions
involving the MEF2C gene. Analysis of blood-derived RNA showed
significantly decreased levels of MEF2C isoform 2 mRNA in all patients
with deletions in or including the MEF2C gene region, including the
patients reported by Engels et al. (2009), Cardoso et al. (2009), and Le
Meur et al. (2010), suggesting haploinsufficiency. Two patients with
missense mutations did not show decreased MEF2C mRNA levels. All
deletions and mutations caused significantly decreased MEF2C
transcriptional activity, which could be rescued by wildtype MEF2C.
Finally, all patients, including the 2 with missense mutations, showed
decreased levels of MECP2 mRNA, and all except 2 patients had decreased
levels of CDKL5 mRNA. These 2 genes are involved in Rett or Rett
syndrome-like phenotypes (312750 and 300672, respectively), which shares
some features with MRD20. Zweier et al. (2010) concluded that the
phenotype results from involvement of a common pathway involving these 3
genes.

ANIMAL MODEL

Members of the MEF2 family of MADs-box transcription factors bind to an
A-T-rich DNA sequence associated with muscle-specific genes. The murine
Mef2c gene is expressed in heart precursor cells before formation of the
linear heart tube. In mice homozygous for a known mutation of Mef2c, Lin
et al. (1997) found that the heart tube did not undergo looping
morphogenesis, the future right ventricle did not form, and a subset of
cardiac muscle genes was not expressed. The absence of the right
ventricular region of the mutant correlated with downregulation of the
dHAND gene, which encodes a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor
required for cardiac morphogenesis. The authors concluded that MEF2C is
an essential regulator of cardiac morphogenesis and right ventricular
development.

Von Both et al. (2004) characterized the molecular basis for defective
heart formation in Foxh1 (603621)-null mice and determined that Mef2c is
a direct target of Foxh1. They identified a composite Foxh1-Nkx2.5
(600584)-binding site within the Mef2c gene that was regulated by
Tgf-beta (see 190180) signaling in a Smad-dependent manner. Von Both et
al. (2004) concluded that a TGF-beta-like SMAD signaling pathway
specifies the anterior heart field through a FOXH1-NKX2.5 complex that
regulates MEF2C expression.

Verzi et al. (2007) found that conditional inactivation of Mef2c in
mouse neural crest resulted in neonatal lethality due to severe
craniofacial defects. Mef2c was required for expression of Dlx5
(600028), Dlx6 (600030), and Hand2 (602407) transcription factors in the
branchial arches, and Verzi et al. (2007) identified a branchial
arch-specific enhancer in the Dlx5/Dlx6 locus that was activated
synergistically by Mef2c and Dlx5. Mef2c and Dlx5/Dlx6 also interacted
genetically, since mice heterozygous for either Dlx5/Dlx6 or Mef2c were
normal at birth and survived to weaning, whereas heterozygosity for both
Dlx5/Dlx6 and Mef2c resulted in defective palate development and
neonatal lethality.

Barbosa et al. (2008) found that mice with brain-specific deletion of
the Mef2c gene were viable to adulthood, were slightly smaller than
wildtype littermates, and showed impaired balance beam walking and an
abnormal hind/forelimb clasping reflex at a young age. In addition,
Mef2c-knockout mice showed impaired hippocampal-dependent learning and
memory. These behavioral changes were accompanied by a marked increase
in the number of excitatory synapses and potentiation of basal and
evoked synaptic transmission resulting from altered presynaptic
function. Conversely, neuronal expression of a superactivating form of
Mef2c in postsynaptic cells resulted in a reduction of excitatory
postsynaptic sites without affecting learning and memory performance. No
changes in synapse structure were observed. The findings suggested that
MEF2C activity per se does not directly determine learning, but somehow
facilitates learning-related plasticity by controlling excessive
synaptic input. Barbosa et al. (2008) concluded that refinement of
synaptic connectivity facilitates hippocampal-dependent learning and
memory.

Li et al. (2008) found that conditional knockout of Mef2c in nestin
(NES; 600915)-expressing neural stem/progenitor cells impaired neuronal
differentiation in mice, resulting in aberrant aggregation and
compaction of neurons migrating into the lower layers of the neocortex
during development. Neural stem cell proliferation and survival were not
affected. Conditional Mef2c-null mice surviving to adulthood manifested
smaller, less mature neurons and smaller brain size with more immature
electrophysiologic network properties. They also showed severe
behavioral deficits reminiscent of Rett syndrome (RTT; 312750), such as
anxiety, decreased cognitive function, and marked paw-clasping. Li et
al. (2008) concluded that MEF2C has a crucial role in programming early
neuronal differentiation and proper distribution within the layers of
the neocortex during development.

the MEF2C gene, predicted to result in premature termination
(N153TfsX33) and loss of the functional transactivation domain. In
infancy, the patient had poor feeding due to marked hypotonia and poor
eye contact due to strabismus. Motor milestones were delayed, and she
walked at age 4 years. At age 18 months, she had a single episode of
myoclonic febrile seizures that were easily controlled. At age 7 years,
she had poor growth, microcephaly (-2.5 SD), lack of speech,
stereotypical movements, unstable wide-based gait, and happy demeanor.

610819	TITLE *610819 SOLUTE CARRIER FAMILY 25, MEMBER 38; SLC25A38
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SLC25A38 belongs to the SLC25 family of mitochondrial carrier proteins
(Haitina et al., 2006).

CLONING

By searching databases for SLC25 family members, Haitina et al. (2006)
identified SLC25A38. The deduced protein contains 303 amino acids.

Guernsey et al. (2009) found high expression of the SLC25A38 gene in
transferrin receptor (TFRC; 190010)-positive erythroid cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Haitina et al. (2006) determined that the SLC25A38 gene contains 7
exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Haitina et al. (2006) mapped the SLC25A38
gene to chromosome 3. They mapped the mouse gene to chromosome 9.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 18 patients with autosomal recessive pyridoxine-refractory
sideroblastic anemia (205950), Guernsey et al. (2009) identified 11
different homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the SLC25A38
gene (see, e.g., 610819.0001-610819.0005). Three unrelated patients who
were of Acadian descent from the Maritime Canadian provinces carried the
same mutation (R117X; 610819.0001). The other patients were of Northern
European, Greek, Hispanic, and Asian Indian descent.

ANIMAL MODEL

In Zebrafish embryos, Guernsey et al. (2009) found that knockdown of the
2 functional SLC25A38 orthologs, Slc25a38a and Slc25a38b, resulted in an
anemic phenotype. In yeast, deletion of the putative ortholog YDL119c
caused a defect in respiration, indicating an impairment of heme
biosynthesis. Biochemical analysis indicated a 6.7-fold reduction in the
amount of total cellular 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) in the yeast
deletion strain, suggesting that loss of YDL119c impairs
5-aminolevulinic acid synthesis in vivo. Guernsey et al. (2009)
hypothesized that SLC25A38 facilitates ALA production by importing
glycine into mitochondria or by exchanging glycine for ALA across the
mitochondrial inner membrane.

SLC25A38, ARG117TER

In 3 unrelated patients with autosomal recessive sideroblastic anemia
(205950) from the Canadian Maritime provinces, Guernsey et al. (2009)
identified a homozygous 726C-T transition in exon 4 of the SLC25A38
gene, resulting in an arg117-to-ter (R117X) substitution. The unaffected
parents were heterozygous for the mutation, which was not found in 145
controls. All patients were of Acadian descent and had onset of severe
anemia before 4 months of age. Bone marrow aspirates showed ringed
sideroblasts. The same homozygous mutation was also observed in 2 Greek
sibs with sideroblastic anemia.

In 2 unrelated patients with autosomal recessive sideroblastic anemia
(205950), Guernsey et al. (2009) identified a homozygous 2-bp deletion
(698delCT) in the SLC25A38 gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature
termination. One patient was of Hispanic descent and the other of
European descent. In 4 others patients with sideroblastic anemia, The
698delCT deletion was observed in compound heterozygosity with another
putative pathogenic mutation in 4 additional patients with sideroblastic
anemia (see, e.g., R187P, 610819.0003).

.0003

In 2 sibs of Northern European descent with autosomal recessive
sideroblastic anemia (205950), Guernsey et al. (2009) identified
compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the SLC25A38 gene: a 937G-C
transversion, resulting in an arg187-to-pro (R187P) substitution, and a
2-bp deletion (698delCT; 610819.0002). The R187P substitution occurs in
a conserved residue in transmembrane helix-4.

300044	TITLE *300044 TRANSKETOLASE-LIKE 1; TKTL1
;;TRANSKETOLASE 2; TKT2;;
TRANSKETOLASE-RELATED GENE; TKR
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Transketolase (TKT; 606781) is a thiamine-dependent enzyme that links
the pentose phosphate pathway with the glycolytic pathway. As part of a
systematic search for differentially expressed genes, Coy et al. (1996)
isolated a novel transketolase-related gene, TKTL1, which they called
TKR. They isolated transcripts encoding tissue-specific protein
isoforms. Comparison with known transketolases demonstrated a
TKR-specific deletion mutating 1 thiamine-binding site.

MAPPING

Coy et al. (1996) mapped the TKR gene between the green color vision
pigment gene (300821) and the actin-binding protein-280 filamin gene
(300017) on Xq28.

EVOLUTION

Genomic sequencing of the TKR gene by Coy et al. (1996) revealed the
presence of a pseudoexon, as well as the acquisition of a
tissue-specific spliced exon, compared to the TKT gene, which maps to
3p14.3. Coy et al. (1996) speculated that, since it had been postulated
that the vertebrate genome arose by 2 cycles of tetraploidization from a
cephalochordate genome, the finding of the pseudoexon and spliced exon
could reflect the modulation of the function of a preexisting
transketolase gene by gene duplication.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

A variant transketolase enzyme has been proposed to be associated with
Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (277730); however, no mutations have been
found in the transketolase gene cloned from these patients (McCool et
al., 1993). The findings of Coy et al. (1996) raised the possibility
that variation in the X-linked TKT gene may be responsible for the
genetic predisposition to the development of Wernicke-Korsakoff
syndrome.

610055	TITLE *610055 COILED-COIL AND C2 DOMAINS-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1A; CC2D1A
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching for genes along a region of chromosome 19 associated with
autosomal recessive nonsyndromic mental retardation, Basel-Vanagaite et
al. (2006) identified CC2D1A. The deduced 950-amino acid protein
contains a C2 domain and a DM14 motif. A deduced 338-amino acid isoform
does not contain the DM motif. In situ hybridization of day 12 mouse
embryos detected Cc2d1a throughout the ventricular zone and developing
cortical plate and ganglionic eminences. By embryonic day 16, expression
was strongest in the cortical plate; from postnatal day 3 into
adulthood, expression was strongest in the cerebral cortex and
hippocampus, particularly in hippocampal region CA3. Western blot
analysis of normal human lymphoblastoid cells detected CC2D1A at an
apparent molecular mass of 104 kD. Immunohistochemical analysis detected
CC2D1a in the cytoplasm of human osteosarcoma cells.

Gallagher and Knoblich (2006) and Jaekel and Klein (2006) found that
Drosophila Lgd, an ortholog of CC2D1A and CC2D1B, regulated endocytosis
and was required for endosomal trafficking of Notch (190198). Jaekel and
Klein (2006) showed that, in the absence of Lgd, Notch was activated in
a ligand-independent manner. They also found that murine Cc2d1a and
Cc2d1b could substitute for loss of Lgd function in flies.

GENE STRUCTURE

Basel-Vanagaite et al. (2006) determined that the CC2D1A gene contains
31 exons and spans 37 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Basel-Vanagaite et al. (2006) mapped the
CC2D1A gene to chromosome 19p13.12.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of 9 consanguineous Israeli-Arab families with
nonsyndromic mental retardation-3 (MRT3; 608443) from the same village
and with the same family name, Basel-Vanagaite et al. (2006) identified
homozygosity for a protein-truncating mutation in the CC2D1A gene
(610055.0001). The parents were heterozygous for the mutation, which was
not found in 300 control chromosomes.

In affected members of 9 consanguineous Israeli-Arab families with
nonsyndromic mental retardation-3 (608443) from the same village and
with the same family name, Basel-Vanagaite et al. (2006) identified
homozygosity for a deletion of 3,589 nucleotides beginning in intron 13
and ending in intron 16 of the CC2D1A gene. The deletion introduces a
frameshift, creating a 30-amino acid nonsense peptide and a stop codon
at position 438 of the mutant protein. The parents were heterozygous for
the mutation, which was not found in 300 control chromosomes.

604939	TITLE *604939 PHOSPHOLIPASE A2 RECEPTOR 1; PLA2R1
;;PHOSPHOLIPASE A2 RECEPTOR, 180-KD;;
PLA2R
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Secretory phospholipases A2 (PLA2s) have been purified from a variety of
mammalian tissues as well as from insect and snake venoms. The prototype
group I PLA2, the pancreatic PLA2 (PLA2G1B; 172410), is involved in
digestion, smooth muscle contraction, and cell proliferation. The
prototype group II PLA2, the inflammatory-type PLA2 (PLA2G2A; 172411),
is involved in inflammatory conditions and is upregulated by
proinflammatory cytokines like tumor necrosis factor (TNF; 191160) and
interleukin-1 (e.g., IL1B; 147720). Differential toxicity of snake venom
Pla2 appears to be linked to a variety of high-affinity receptors in
different organs (Ancian et al., 1995).

CLONING

By screening lung and kidney cDNA libraries with a rabbit Pla2 probe,
Ancian et al. (1995) isolated a cDNA encoding PLA2R1. Sequence analysis
revealed that the deduced 1,465-amino acid PLA2R1 transmembrane protein
contains a 25-amino acid signal sequence, 15 potential N-glycosylation
sites, an N-terminal cysteine-rich domain, a fibronectin-like type II
domain, 8 carbohydrate recognition domains, and a short C-terminal
cytoplasmic tail containing a consensus sequence (asn-pro-X-tyr) also
found in bovine Pla2r1. A casein-kinase II phosphorylation site is also
located in this C-terminal region. Ancian et al. (1995) identified a
splice variant encoding a soluble form of PLA2R1. Quantitative PCR
analysis suggested that the ratio for the transcription of membrane to
soluble PLA2R1 is 1.6. Northern blot analysis detected strong expression
of 6.5- and 5.4-kb PLA2R1 transcripts in kidney, with moderate
expression in placenta, lung, and skeletal muscle. Binding analysis
showed that snake venom Pla2 binds to both forms of PLA2R1, and binding
could be blocked by pancreatic PLA2 but not by bee venom or inflammatory
PLA2. Using a radioactive probe and kinetic analyses, Ancian et al.
(1995) observed that membrane PLA2R1 is internalized and that its ligand
is degraded, suggesting a role for the receptor in clearing and possibly
inhibiting PLA2 action.

MAPPING

By radioactive in situ hybridization, Ancian et al. (1995) mapped the
PLA2R1 gene to 2q23-q24.

GENE FUNCTION

Beck et al. (2009) identified PLA2R as a target antigen in idiopathic
membranous nephropathy, an organ-specific autoimmune disease. Serum
samples from 26 (70%) of 37 patients with idiopathic, but not secondary,
membranous nephropathy specifically identified a 185-kD glycoprotein
that was present in nonreduced glomerular extract. Mass spectrometry of
the reactive protein band identified the M-type phospholipase A2
receptor. Reactive serum specimens recognized recombinant PLA2R and
bound the same 185-kD glomerular protein as did the monospecific
antibody. Anti-PLA2R autoantibodies in serum samples from patients with
membranous nephropathy were mainly IgG4, the predominant immunoglobulin
subclass in glomerular deposits. PLA2R was found to be normally
expressed in podocytes of human glomeruli and colocalized with IgG4 in
immune deposits in glomeruli of patients with membranous nephropathy.
IgG eluted from such deposits in patients with idiopathic membranous
nephropathy, but not in those with lupus membranous (SLE; 152700) or IgA
nephropathy (IGAN1; 161950). The findings demonstrated that a majority
of patients with idiopathic membranous nephropathy have antibodies
against a conformation-dependent epitope in PLA2R.

Stahl et al. (2010) reported a 56-year-old woman with biopsy-proven
membranous nephropathy that progressed to end-stage renal failure
necessitating renal transplantation. The nephropathy recurred within 3
days after transplantation. Anti-PLA2R antibodies were detected in serum
both before and after transplantation. After rituximab therapy, the
antibody titer fell from 1:100 to 1:20 and was associated with clinical
improvement. Stahl et al. (2010) suggested that the presence of
anti-PLA2R antibodies may identify potential risk of recurrence of
membranous nephropathy in patients undergoing renal transplant.

Debiec and Ronco (2011) assessed the presence of PLA2R autoantibody in
the serum and PLA2R in glomerular deposits in 42 consecutive patients
with biopsy-proven membranous nephropathy (614692) without features of
secondary disease. Serum samples were collected before treatment at the
time of biopsy. The sensitivities of the serum and biopsy tests were 57%
and 74%, respectively. Of the 42 patients, 21 with circulating PLA2R
autoantibodies had PLA2R in glomerular deposits. However, Debiec and
Ronco (2011) also found 3 patients who had a high circulating level of
PLA2R autoantibodies at a serum dilution of 1:3000 and who did not have
detectable PLA2R in glomerular deposits. The authors noted that these
cases might suggest that antibodies were not nephritogenic or that
epitopes were poorly accessible at the time of kidney biopsy. Eighteen
patients had no detectable PLA2R autoantibodies even at a serum dilution
of 1:10, although 10 of them had PLA2R in glomerular deposits. These
discordant findings might be due to rapid clearance of antibodies from
the blood and deposition in glomeruli or to the late referral of
patients when proteinuria persisted because of irreversible
ultrastructural changes. The authors concluded that the absence of
circulating PLA2R autoantibody at the time of kidney biopsy does not
rule out a diagnosis of PLA2R-related membranous nephropathy.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Stanescu et al. (2011) identified significant association between a SNP
in PLA2R1 (dbSNP rs4664308, with a p value of 8.6 x 10(-29)) and
idiopathic membranous nephropathy in 3 independent populations of
European descent: French, Dutch, and British.

612753	TITLE *612753 COLLAGEN AND CALCIUM-BINDING EGF DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1; CCBE1
;;KIAA1983
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2001) cloned CCBE1, which they designated
KIAA1983. The transcript contains a repetitive element in its 3-prime
end, and the deduced protein contains 418 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA
detected highest expression in ovary and much lower expression in fetal
liver and in adult lung, liver, and kidney. Much weaker expression was
detected in all other adult and fetal tissues examined.

MAPPING

Hartz (2009) mapped the CCBE1 gene to chromosome 18q21.32 based on an
alignment of the CCBE1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AB075863) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.1).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 5 affected individuals from consanguineous families with Hennekam
lymphangiectasia-lymphedema syndrome (235510) mapping to chromosome
18q21, including 3 patients from a Dutch pedigree, 1 Omani patient, and
1 Iraqi patient, Alders et al. (2009) sequenced the candidate gene CCBE1
and identified homozygosity for missense mutations in all 5 patients
(612753.0001-612753.0003, respectively). Analysis of CCBE1 in 19
additional families with Hennekam syndrome identified 2 unrelated
probands who were compound heterozygotes for a nonsense mutation
(612753.0004) and 2 different missense mutations (612753.0005 or
612753.0006).

By linkage and haplotype analysis of 3 affected sibs from a British
family, including a 6-year-old proband,

In a 6-year-old British girl with generalized lymphatic dysplasia and 2
deceased male sibs with lymphedema and severe fetal hydrops,
respectively, Connell et al. (2010) performed linkage and haplotype
analysis to identify a candidate region on chromosome 18q. Sequencing
analysis of candidate genes identified homozygosity for the C75S
mutation in the CCBE1 gene (612753.0001) in all 3 affected sibs.

ANIMAL MODEL

Hogan et al. (2009) described a zebrafish mutant called 'full of fluid'
(fof) that lacked the thoracic duct and intersegmental and dorsal
longitudinal lymphatic vessels, but retained an apparently normal blood
vasculature. Hogan et al. (2009) found fof zebrafish had a mutation in
the Ccbe1 gene. In wildtype zebrafish, Ccbe1 was expressed spatially and
temporally in the migration routes of lymphatic endothelial cells, but
not in lymphatic endothelial cells themselves. Ccbe1 acted at the same
stage of development as Vegfc (601528) and was required for
lymphangioblast budding and angiogenic sprouting from venous
endothelium. Hogan et al. (2009) concluded that CCBE1 may be a guidance
molecule that regulates lymphangioblast budding and possibly migration.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001

CCBE1, CYS75SER

In 3 affected members of a consanguineous Dutch pedigree with Hennekam
lymphangiectasia-lymphedema syndrome (235510), Alders et al. (2009)
identified homozygosity for a 223T-A transversion in the CCBE1 gene,
resulting in a cys75-to-ser (C75S) substitution at a residue N-terminal
of the putative calcium-binding EGF domain. The unaffected parents of
all 3 patients were heterozygous for the mutation, which was not found
in 100 western European controls. In a zebrafish lymphangiogenesis
model, mutant mRNA equivalent to human C75S showed weak rescue of the
morphant phenotype, indicating preservation of some protein function.

In a 6-year-old British girl with generalized lymphatic dysplasia and 2
deceased male sibs with lymphedema and severe fetal hydrops,
respectively, Connell et al. (2010) identified homozygosity for the C75S
mutation in the CCBE1 gene. The mutation was present in heterozygosity
in the unaffected parents and 4 unaffected sibs, but was not found in 3
more unaffected sibs and 400 control chromosomes.

In a 7-year-old boy with Hennekam lymphangiectasia-lymphedema syndrome
(235510) from a consanguineous Omani family, Alders et al. (2009)
identified homozygosity for a 305G-C transversion in the CCBE1 gene,
resulting in a cys102-to-ser (C102S) substitution at a residue
N-terminal of the putative calcium-binding EGF domain. The unaffected
parents were heterozygous for the mutation, which was not found in 97
Iraqi controls. In a zebrafish lymphangiogenesis model, mutant mRNA
equivalent to human C102S was not able to confer any rescue of the
morphant phenotype.

CCBE1, GLY237ARG

In a 5-year-old girl with Hennekam lymphangiectasia-lymphedema syndrome
(235510) from a consanguineous Iraqi family, Alders et al. (2009)
identified homozygosity for a 979G-C transversion in the CCBE1 gene
resulting in a gly237-to-arg (G237R) substitution predicted to disrupt
the glycine backbone in the putative collagen helix. The unaffected
parents were heterozygous for the mutation, which was not found in 97
Iraqi controls. In a zebrafish lymphangiogenesis model, mutant mRNA
equivalent to human G237R was not able to confer any rescue of the
morphant phenotype.

.0004
HENNEKAM LYMPHANGIECTASIA-LYMPHEDEMA SYNDROME
CCBE1, 1-BP INS, 683T

In a 20-year-old Dutch man and a 1-year-old Norwegian boy with Hennekam
lymphangiectasia-lymphedema syndrome (235510), Alders et al. (2009)
identified compound heterozygosity for a 1-bp insertion (683_684insT) in
the CCBE1 gene, resulting in an in-frame premature termination codon
predicted to cause production of protein lacking the collagen domain or
nonsense-mediated decay, and a missense mutation (612753.0005 or
612753.0006, respectively). None of the mutations was found in 100
western European controls.

.0005
HENNEKAM LYMPHANGIECTASIA-LYMPHEDEMA SYNDROME
CCBE1, ARG158CYS

In a 20-year-old Dutch man with Hennekam lymphangiectasia-lymphedema
syndrome (235510), Alders et al. (2009) identified compound
heterozygosity for a 472C-T transition in the CCBE1 gene, resulting in
an arg158-to-cys (R158C) substitution that introduces an extra cysteine
predicted to interfere with proper folding of the protein, and a
nonsense mutation (612753.0004). In a zebrafish lymphangiogenesis model,
mutant mRNA equivalent to human R158C showed rescue of the morphant
phenotype comparable to that seen with wildtype, indicating some
preservation of protein function.

.0006
HENNEKAM LYMPHANGIECTASIA-LYMPHEDEMA SYNDROME
CCBE1, CYS174ARG

In a 1-year-old Norwegian boy with Hennekam lymphangiectasia-lymphedema
syndrome (235510), Alders et al. (2009) identified compound
heterozygosity for a 520T-C transition in the CCBE1 gene, resulting in a
cys174-to-arg (C174R) substitution at a conserved residue predicted to
form disulfide bonds important for the secondary structure of the
calcium-binding EGF domain, and a nonsense mutation (612753.0004). In a
zebrafish lymphangiogenesis model, mutant mRNA equivalent to human C174R
was not able to confer any rescue of the morphant phenotype.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Sulfonation, an important step in the metabolism of many drugs,
xenobiotics, hormones, and neurotransmitters, is catalyzed by
sulfotransferases. Honke et al. (1997) isolated a cDNA encoding human
GalCer sulfotransferase (EC 2.8.2.11) from a renal cancer cell cDNA
library by RT-PCR, using degenerate oligonucleotides based on the
partial GalCer sulfotransferase amino acid sequence, and by direct cDNA
library screening. The GalCer sulfotransferase cDNA encodes a 423-amino
acid protein with a predicted type II transmembrane topology and 2
potential N-linked glycosylation sites. GalCer sulfotransferase is not
homologous to either the cytosolic sulfotransferases or the Golgi
sulfotransferases. Using Northern blot analysis, Honke et al. (1997)
detected a 1.9-kb GalCer sulfotransferase transcript in renal cancer
cells, but not in the other human cancer cells examined.

GENE FUNCTION

Honke et al. (1997) noted that GalCer sulfotransferase activity is
remarkably enhanced in human renal cell carcinoma.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the GAL3ST1
gene to chromosome 22 (TMAP SGC33827).

;;PORPHOBILINOGEN DEAMINASE; PBGD;;
PRE-UROPORPHYRINOGEN SYNTHASE;;
UROPORPHYRINOGEN I SYNTHASE;;
UROPORPHYRINOGEN I SYNTHETASE
DESCRIPTION Porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD; EC 4.3.1.8) is the third enzyme of the
biosynthetic pathway leading to the production of heme. It catalyzes the
synthesis of hydroxymethylbilane by stepwise condensation of 4
porphobilinogen units. Hydroxymethylbilane is then converted to
uroporphyrinogen III by uroporphyrinogen III synthetase (UROS; 606938)
(Raich et al., 1986).

CLONING

Raich et al. (1986) isolated a cDNA clone corresponding to the human
erythrocyte porphobilinogen deaminase gene from a human erythrocyte
library prepared from human spleen. The deduced 334-amino acid protein
has a calculated molecular mass of approximately 37.6 kD. Northern blot
analysis identified a single 1.6-kb mRNA transcript.

Grandchamp et al. (1987) determined that there are 2 PBGD isoforms that
differ by approximately 2 kD (40 and 42 kD). One is active in all
tissues and can be isolated from liver, and the other is restricted to
erythrocytes. The nonerythrocyte isoform contains an additional 17 amino
acid residues at the N terminus.

Chretien et al. (1988) demonstrated that the PBGD gene undergoes
alternative splicing with 2 different promoters to yield 2 mRNAs. The
first 'upstream' promoter is active in all tissues and has structural
features of a housekeeping promoter, whereas the second promoter,
located 3 kb downstream, is active only in erythrocytes and shows
structural homology to the beta-globin gene (141900) promoters. The 2
mRNAs differ only in their first exon.

Gubin and Miller (2001) identified 2 alternatively spliced isoforms of
erythroid PBGD in CD34+/- (142230) erythroid precursor cells. Complete
sequencing showed that the alternatively spliced form, designated
PBGD-EA, contained the intron between exons 2 and 3, thus extending the
5-prime untranslated region of the erythroid transcript by 176 bp.
Northern blot analysis identified a distinct 1.5-kb mRNA corresponding
to the alternatively spliced erythrocyte isoform only in bone marrow and
fetal spleen.

GENE STRUCTURE

Chretien et al. (1988) determined that the HMBS gene contains 15 exons
and spans approximately 10 kb of DNA.

The housekeeping HMBS transcript contains exons 1 and 3-15; the
erythroid HMBS transcript is encoded by exons 2-15 (Chen et al., 1994).

MAPPING

By study of mouse-human hybrid clones, Meisler et al. (1980, 1981)
showed that PBG-deaminase is determined by a gene on chromosome 11; Wang
et al. (1981) assigned the locus to the long arm in the segment
11q23-qter. In 3 children with trisomy of 11qter, de Verneuil et al.
(1982) studied expression of uroporphyrinogen I synthase. Dosage effect
supported assignment to the region 11q23.2-qter.

By in situ hybridization and by gene dosage studies in patients with
monosomy or trisomy of the terminal portion of 11q, Namba et al. (1991)
refined the assignment of the PBGD gene to 11q24.1-q24.2.

Tunnacliffe and McGuire (1990) constructed a long-range restriction map
extending over 1.8 Mb of 11q23.3 using pulsed field gel electrophoresis
and concluded that PBGD is situated in the following relation to 5 other
genes: cen--CD3E--CD3D--CD3G--PBGD--CBL2--THY1--qter. They determined
that the CD3G (186740) gene and PBGD are separated by 750 kb.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

By the method of isoelectric focusing, Meisler and Carter (1980)
identified structural variants of PBG-deaminase.

Louie et al. (1992) defined the 3-domain structure of PBGD by x-ray
analysis. Two of the domains structurally resembled the transferrins
(see, e.g., TF; 190000). The x-ray structure and results from
site-directed mutagenesis provided evidence for a single catalytic site.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a large Dutch family with the nonerythroid variant of AIP, Grandchamp
et al. (1989) identified a heterozygous splice site mutation in intron 1
of the PBGD gene (609806.0001). The mutation interrupted the sequence
coding for the nonerythroid isoform of PBGD; thus, expression of the
erythroid isoform was unaffected. In a patient with CRM-positive AIP,
Grandchamp et al. (1989) identified a mutation in the HMBS gene,
resulting in the skipping of exon 12 (609806.0002).

In affected members of 11 different families with either CRM-negative or
CRM-positive AIP, Grandchamp et al. (1990) identified 7 different point
mutations in the PBGD gene.

In a patient with the nonerythroid variant of AIP, Chen et al. (1994)
identified a mutation in the initiation codon of the housekeeping HMBS
isoform (M1V; 609806.0044). Puy et al. (1998) identified 3 different
mutations in the donor splice site of the HMBS gene in 4 unrelated
patients with the nonerythroid variant of AIP. They found that the
splice site mutations resulted in activation of a cryptic splice site
located 67 nucleotides downstream from the normal splice site, leading
to a frameshift and premature stop codon in exon 4.

In 28 Finnish families representing 72% of all AIP families in the
Finnish population of 5 million, Kauppinen et al. (1995) found 19
separate mutations in HMBS: 13 novel mutations, including 1 de novo
event, and 6 previously characterized mutations.

Whatley et al. (1999) found 39 different mutations in the HMBS gene in
54 of 57 consecutive patients with AIP.

In patients with the nonerythroid variant of AIP, Whatley et al. (2000)
identified mutations in the housekeeping promoter (-154delG;
609806.0041) and in exon 3 (41delA; 609806.0042) of the HMBS gene.

Floderus et al. (2002) studied most of the AIP kindreds in Sweden. They
identified 27 novel mutations in the HMBS gene, bringing the total
number of known mutations in the HMBS gene in Sweden to 39. Most of the
mutations were located in exons 10 and 12, with fewer in exon 7.
Floderus et al. (2002) used the 3-dimensional structure of the
porphobilinogen deaminase enzyme to predict the possible molecular and
functional consequences of the novel Swedish missense and nonsense
mutations.

In a patient with AIP, Hessels et al. (2004) detected a novel homozygous
leu81-to-pro (L81P) mutation in exon 6 of the HMBS gene (609806.0045).
Porphobilinogen deaminase activity in red cells was decreased to 2 to
4%.

ANIMAL MODEL

Clavero et al. (2010) described a naturally occurring feline model of
AIP in 4 unrelated cat lines that presented phenotypically as congenital
erythropoietic porphyria (CEP; 263700). Affected cats had erythrodontia,
brownish urine, fluorescent bones, and markedly elevated urinary
uroporphyrin and coproporphyrin, consistent with CEP. However, their
UROS activities (deficient in CEP) were normal. Notably, affected cats
had half-normal HMBS activities and elevated urinary 5-aminolevulinic
acid and porphobilinogen. Sequencing the feline Hmbs gene revealed
different mutations in each line, including a duplication, an in-frame
3-bp deletion (842delGAG), and 2 missense (A84T and R149W) mutations.
The 842delGAG and R149W mutations were identical to mutations reported
in human. Prokaryotic expression of the 842delGAG and R149W mutations
resulted in mutant enzymes with less than 1% wildtype activity, whereas
the A84T mutation expressed a stable enzyme with approximately 35% of
wildtype activity. The discolored teeth from the affected cats contained
markedly elevated URO I and III, accounting for the CEP-like phenocopy.
In 3 lines, the phenotype was an autosomal dominant trait, while
affected cats with the A84T mutation were homozygous, a unique recessive
form of AIP.

HMBS, IVS1DS, G-A, +1

In affected members of a large Dutch family with the nonerythroid
variant of acute intermittent porphyria (176000), Grandchamp et al.
(1989) identified a G-to-A transition in the 5-prime splice donor site
of intron 1 of the HMBS gene. The mutation interrupted the sequence
coding for the nonerythroid isoform of PBGD; thus, expression of the
erythroid isoform was unaffected. Hybridization analysis using
oligonucleotide probes after in vitro amplification of genomic DNA
offered another possibility of detecting asymptomatic carriers of the
mutation in affected families.

Puy et al. (1997, 1998) identified this splice site mutation in patients
with nonerythroid variant AIP.

Petrides (1998) identified the G-to-A transition in intron 1 of the HMBS
gene in 9 members of a German kindred in which the proband had a
life-threatening coma due to the nonerythroid variant of AIP. The newly
identified family members were taught how to prevent porphyric attacks.

In a patient with acute intermittent porphyria (176000), Grandchamp et
al. (1989) identified a G-to-A transition in exon 12 of the HMBS gene,
resulting in the skipping of exon 12. The resulting aberrant mRNA
encoded a truncated protein that was inactive, but stable, and could be
detected using antibodies directed against the normal enzyme
(CRM-positive).

PORPHYRIA, ACUTE INTERMITTENT, NONERYTHROID VARIANT
HMBS, IVS1DS, G-T, +1

In a Finnish family with the nonerythroid variant of acute intermittent
porphyria (176000) Grandchamp et al. (1989) identified a G-to-T
transversion in the 5-prime splice donor sequence of intron 1 of the
HMBS gene. This is only 1 nucleotide removed from the mutation listed as
609806.0001, in which the change occurred in the first nucleotide of
intron 1. Grandchamp et al. (1989) proposed that both of these mutations
resulted in an abnormal splicing of primary transcripts initiated at the
upstream promoter of the gene without affecting the expression of the
PBGD gene in erythroid cells where the downstream promoter is utilized.
A similar mutation located at the last position of exon 1 of the
beta-globin gene was found by Vidaud et al. (1989) to be responsible for
a splicing defect leading to beta-thalassemia.

In a brother and sister with severe AIP (176000), Llewellyn et al.
(1992) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the PBGD
gene: a 500G-A transition, resulting in an R167Q substitution, and a

HMBS, 9-BP DEL, EX10

In a patient with CRM-positive AIP (176000), Delfau et al. (1991)

In affected members of a northern Swedish (Lappland) family with AIP
(176000), Lee and Anvret (1991) identified a G-to-A transition in exon
10 of the HMBS gene, resulting in a trp198-to-ter (W198X) substitution.
The same mutation was found in 15 of 33 Swedish AIP families. Genealogic
data showed that 12 of the 15 were related, indicating a founder effect.

HMBS, ARG167TRP

In a brother and sister with severe AIP (176000), Llewellyn et al.
(1992) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the PBGD
gene: a 499C-T transition, resulting in an arg167-to-trp (R167W)
substitution, and an adjacent 500G-A transition, resulting in an R167Q
(609806.0005) substitution.

The seemingly high frequency of mutations in exon 10 (Delfau et al.,
1990) prompted Gu et al. (1992) to screen this exon in 41 unrelated AIP
patients by use of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) after
PCR amplification. In about one-fourth of the patients, they
distinguished 3 abnormal migration patterns, indicating the presence of
mutation in heterozygous state. Sequencing demonstrated the presence of
3 different single-base substitutions: R167Q, R173Q (609806.0006), and
R167W.

In Finland, Kauppinen et al. (1992) found an R167W mutation in 3 out of
7 families with CRM-positive AIP. DNA analyses of family members
demonstrated that conventional assays of erythrocyte PBGD activity
identified correctly only 72% of the carriers of the mutation.

Solis et al. (2004) reported a Spanish AIP patient who was homozygous
for the R167W substitution. Both parents were heterozygous for the
mutation. The patient had a severe course, with psychomotor delay,
dystonic movements, axial hypotonia, delayed myelination, and death at
age 40 months.

Solis et al. (2004) noted that the R167W, R173Q, and R167Q mutations all
occur at CpG dinucleotides within exon 10, and can thus be considered
mutation hotspots. All 3 substitutions alter highly conserved arginines
in the enzyme's active site, which interact with the precursor
porphobilinogen and the acidic side chains of the enzyme's
dipyrromethane cofactor. Functional expression studies showed that all 3
substitutions resulted in less than 2% normal HMBS activity.

Using site-directed mutagenesis, Lander et al. (1991) demonstrated that
an arg167-to-leu (R167L) substitution in the HMBS protein resulted in a

noteworthy that substitution of arg167 by glutamine (R167Q; 609806.0005)
and by tryptophan (R167W; 609806.0013) resulted in loss of enzyme

Nearly 60% of all Swiss AIP patients carry the W283X mutation. In
France, the prevalence of W283X is less than 5% (Schneider-Yin et al.,

In affected members of 2 Finnish families with acute intermittent

445C-T transition in exon 9 of the HMBS gene, resulting in an
arg149-to-ter (R149X) substitution.

Poblete-Gutierrez et al. (2006) identified a heterozygous R149X
substitution in affected members of the original family with so-called
'Chester type porphyria' (McColl et al., 1985) (see 176000). The
mutation was not found in 200 control chromosomes. The family had
originally been reported as having features of both AIP and variegated
porphyria (VP; 176200), but no mutations in the PPOX gene (600923) were
identified. The mutation occurred at a hypermutable CpG dinucleotide.
The findings confirmed that Chester type porphyria is a variant of AIP.
Poblete-Gutierrez et al. (2006) suggested that the original biochemical
studies indicating PPOX deficiency may have been erroneous or
misinterpreted. A different mutation in this codon has also been
associated with AIP (R149Q; 609806.0008).

611192	TITLE *611192 ANKYRIN REPEAT DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 11; ANKRD11
;;ANKYRIN REPEAT-CONTAINING COFACTOR 1; ANCO1;;
NASOPHARYNGEAL CARCINOMA SUSCEPTIBILITY PROTEIN;;
T13;;
LZ16
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ANKRD11 is a member of a family of ankyrin repeat-containing cofactors
that interacts with p160 nuclear receptor coactivators (see NCOA1;
602691) and inhibits ligand-dependent transcriptional activation (Zhang
et al., 2004).

CLONING

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis with the conserved N-terminal basic
helix-loop-helix (bHLH) domain of p160 nuclear receptor coactivator RAC3
(NCOA3; 601937) as bait, Zhang et al. (2004) cloned ANKRD11, which they
called ANCO1. The deduced 2,663-amino acid protein had a calculated
molecular mass of 298 kD and contained five 33-amino acid ankyrin
repeats, a highly charged central region, and many putative nuclear
localization signals. Zhang et al. (2004) found that ANCO1 is identical
to the previously isolated nasopharyngeal carcinoma susceptibility
protein LZ16. Northern blot analysis detected a 10-kb transcript in many
human tissues and cancer cell lines, with highest expression in skeletal
muscle and chronic myeloid leukemia K562 cells. Smaller transcripts of
3.5 and 7.5 kb were detected. Immunofluorescence studies localized ANCO1
to discrete nuclear foci that colocalized with histone deacetylaces
HDAC3 (605166), HDAC4 (605314), and HDAC5 (605315) specifically.

Using nonquantitative RT-PCR, Sirmaci et al. (2011) confirmed expression
of ANKRD11 in the human adult brain. Examination of transfected mouse
neonatal cerebral cortical primary cultures using fluorescence
microscopy revealed that ANKRD11 localized mainly to the nuclei of
neurons and glial cells and only a relatively small amount was localized
in the cytoplasm. Depolarization of the cells significantly induced
nuclear accumulation of ANKRD11 in discrete inclusions.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Zhang et al. (2004) mapped the ANKRD11
gene to chromosome 16q24.3.

GENE FUNCTION

Using yeast 2-hybrid and GST pull-down studies, Zhang et al. (2004)
demonstrated that the C-terminal amino acids of ANCO1 (2597-2663) bound
p160 nuclear coactivators RAC3, TIF2 (NCOA2; 601993), and SRC1 (NCOA1;
602691). By GST pull-down assay and coimmunoprecipitation studies, the
authors showed that ANCO1 bound histone deacetylases HDAC3, HDAC4, and
HDAC5 via an HDAC binding domain distinct from the ANCO1 p160
coactivator binding domain. Overexpression of ANCO1 inhibited
transcriptional activation by nuclear receptors, including the
mineralocorticoid (NR3C2; 600983), androgen (AR; 313700), progesterone
(PGR; 607311), and glucocorticoid (GCCR; 138040) receptors. The results
of competition studies with ANCO1 and p160 coactivator TIF2 suggested to
Zhang et al. (2004) that ANCO1 inhibits ligand-dependent transactivation
by recruiting HDACs to the coactivator/nuclear receptor complex.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a Turkish family with macrodontia, mental retardation, characteristic
facies, short stature, and skeletal anomalies (KBG syndrome, KBGS;
148050), originally reported by Tekin et al. (2004), Sirmaci et al.
(2011) performed whole-exome capture followed by next-generation
sequencing and identified a heterozygous splice site variant in the
ANKRD11 gene (611192.0001) that segregated with disease and was not
found in ethnically matched controls. Analysis of ANKRD11 in 9
additional KBGS probands revealed heterozygosity for truncating
mutations in 4 of them (see, e.g., 611192.0002 and 611192.0003). All 5
mutations involved the highly conserved C-terminal repression domain of
ANKRD11.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
KBG SYNDROME
ANKRD11, IVS10, G-C, -1

In a father and 2 sons from a Turkish family with KBG syndrome (148050),
originally reported by Tekin et al. (2004), Sirmaci et al. (2011)
identified heterozygosity for a G-C transversion at the splice acceptor
site (7570-1G-C) in intron 10 of the ANKRD11 gene, resulting in the
deletion of 2 residues located in the highly conserved C-terminal
repression domain. The mutation was not found in the unaffected mother
or in 339 Turkish controls. The 46-year-old father, who was the oldest
affected individual studied by Sirmaci et al. (2011), had developed
moderate kyphosis and osteopenia with age.

In a 16-year-old Turkish boy with KBG syndrome (148050), Sirmaci et al.
(2011) identified heterozygosity for a de novo 1-bp deletion (2305delT)
in exon 9 of the ANKRD11 gene, causing a frameshift predicted to result
in a premature termination codon. The mutation was not found in his
unaffected parents or in 255 Turkish controls. Real-time PCR analysis of
peripheral blood RNA from the patient demonstrated reduction of ANKRD11
expression compared to his father.

heterozygosity for a de novo 2-bp deletion (5953delCA) in exon 9 of the
ANKRD11 gene, causing a frameshift predicted to result in a premature

or in 40 Italian controls.

606249	TITLE *606249 PROTEIN KINASE, LYSINE-DEFICIENT 2; WNK2
;;PRKWNK2;;
KIAA1760
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

WNK2 is a cytoplasmic serine-threonine kinase (EC 2.7.11.1) that
contains cysteine in place of lysine at the conserved location in
subdomain II of protein kinases, yet has kinase activity (Xu et al.,
2000).

CLONING

Xu et al. (2000) cloned Wnk2 from a rat brain cDNA library. They
referred to the protein as Wnk1 (designating 'with no lysine'). Wnk2 is
a 2,126-amino acid protein of about 230 kD expressed in various cell
lines and tissues. Wnk2 contains a small N-terminal domain followed by a
kinase domain and a long C-terminal tail. The kinase domain has greatest
similarity to the MEKK protein kinase family (see 602448). Wnk2 lacks
the invariant catalytic lysine in subdomain II of protein kinases that
is crucial for binding to ATP. Xu et al. (2000) suggested that the
lys233 in kinase subdomain I may provide this function.

Nagase et al. (2000) obtained a partial human WNK2 clone, which they
designated KIAA1760, that encodes a 1,386-amino acid sequence. RT-PCR
ELISA detected highest expression in adult heart and adult and fetal
brain. Lower expression was detected in skeletal muscle, kidney,
pancreas, spleen, testis, and ovary, with little to no expression in
lung and adult and fetal liver. Within adult brain, high expression was
detected in amygdala, with lower expression in all other regions
examined.

Ito et al. (2001) identified WNK2 (GenBank GENBANK AJ242724) as ppMAPkkk
(GenBank GENBANK AB044546).

Rinehart et al. (2011) showed that full-length human WNK2 contains over
2,000 amino acids. WNK2 has a kinase domain followed by a coiled-coil
motif near its N terminus and a second coiled-coil motif near its C
terminus. Rinehart et al. (2011) identified 12 putative phosphorylation
sites distributed throughout the molecule. Northern blot analysis
detected strong expression of WNK2 transcripts of 9.5 and 7.5 kb in
brain, with little to no expression in uterus, placenta, kidney, spleen,
and lung. In situ hybridization detected widespread Wnk2 expression in
adult and embryonic mouse brain, with prominent expression in neurons.
Western blot analysis of mouse brain detected Wnk2 at an apparent
molecular mass of over 200 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

Xu et al. (2000) found that overexpression of rat Wnk2 in HEK293 cells
exerted no detectable effect on the activity of cotransfected
mitogen-activated protein kinases, suggesting that WNK2 and MEKKs belong
to distinct pathways despite their sequence similarity. Wnk2 could
phosphorylate the exogenous substrate myelin basic protein (MBP;
159430), as well as itself, mostly on serine residues, confirming that
it is a serine-threonine kinase. Mutation of lys233 to met within kinase
subdomain I eliminated Wnk2 activity, consistent with the conclusion
that it is required for catalysis.

By coexpression in Xenopus oocytes, Rinehart et al. (2011) found that
WNK2 promoted Cl- uptake by reciprocally activating NKCC1 (SLC12A2;
600840) and inhibiting KCC2 (SLC12A5; 606726). Mutation of asp342 within
the kinase domain of WNK2 abrogated these effects. Immunoprecipitation
analysis of mouse brain revealed an interaction between Wnk2 and Spak
(STK39; 607648), a kinase that directly interacts with Nkcc1, but not
Kcc2. Rinehart et al. (2011) concluded that WNK2 may work in concert
with a SPAK-containing complex to regulate intracellular chloride
concentration.

612799	TITLE *612799 GLUTAMYL-tRNA SYNTHETASE 2; EARS2
;;GLUTAMYL-tRNA SYNTHETASE, MITOCHONDRIAL;;
MITOCHONDRIAL GLURS;;
KIAA1970
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2001) cloned EARS2, which they designated
KIAA1970. The transcript has repetitive elements in its 3-prime end, and
the deduced protein contains 519 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA detected
robust EARS2 expression in all adult and fetal tissues and specific
adult brain regions examined.

By searching databases for aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases containing a
mitochondrial targeting sequence, Bonnefond et al. (2005) identified
EARS2, which the called mitochondrial GLURS. The deduced 523-amino acid
protein has an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting signal with a
predicted cleavage site after residue 25. EARS2 has characteristics of a
class I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase, including a classical Rossmann fold.

GENE STRUCTURE

Bonnefond et al. (2005) determined that the EARS2 gene contains 9 exons
and spans 33 kb.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Loftus et al. (1999) mapped the EARS2 gene to a
region of chromosome 16p13.1-p11.2 that shows a high degree of gene
duplication.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In an Italian boy with combined oxidative phosphorylation deficiency-12
(COXPD12; 614924) manifest as leukoencephalopathy with thalamus and
brainstem involvement and high lactate, Steenweg et al. (2012)
identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the EARS2 gene
(612799.0001 and 612799.0002) using exome sequencing. Subsequent
analysis of the EARS2 gene in additional patients with a similar
phenotype identified compound heterozygous mutations in 11 patients
(see, e.g., 612799.0001; 612799.0003-612799.0006). The phenotype was
characterized by onset in infancy of hypotonia, delayed psychomotor
development or early developmental regression, and T2-weighted
hyperintensities in the deep cerebral white matter, brainstem, and
cerebellar white matter. Serum lactate was increased, and muscle biopsy
showed defective activity of mitochondrial complexes I, III, and IV.
There were 2 main phenotypic groups: those with a milder disease course
and some recovery of skills after age 2 years, and those with a severe
disease course resulting in marked disability.

Talim et al. (2012) identified a homozygous mutation in the EARS2 gene
(612799.0007) in a Turkish patient with severe COXPD12 resulting in
death at age 3 months. The mutation was identified by exome sequencing.

EARS2, ARG108TRP

In an Italian boy with combined oxidative phosphorylation deficiency-12
(COXPD12; 614924) manifest as leukoencephalopathy with thalamus and
brainstem involvement and high lactate, Steenweg et al. (2012)
identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the EARS2 gene. A
322C-T transition in exon 3, resulting in an arg108-to-trp (R108W)
substitution, was found on the paternal allele, and 2 mutations were
found on the maternal allele: a 502A-G transition in exon 4, resulting
in an arg168-to-gly (R168G) substitution, and a 3-bp insertion
(1279insTCC) in exon 7, resulting in an amino acid insertion
(T426_R427insL; 612799.0002). The 2 maternal mutations were absent from
several large databases including 12,000 alleles, whereas the R108W
mutation was found in 3 of 13,500 alleles. These mutations were found by
exome sequencing in the patient. Subsequent analysis of the EARS2 gene
in additional patients with a similar phenotype identified the R108W
mutation in 4 additional patients; all carried the R108W mutation in
compound heterozygosity with another pathogenic EARS2 mutation.

In 2 unrelated patients with COXPD12 (614924), Steenweg et al. (2012)
identified a heterozygous 328G-A transition in exon 3 of the EARS2 gene,
resulting in a gly110-to-ser (G110S) substitution. One patient was
compound heterozygous for an R108W (612799.0001) mutation on the second
allele, and the other had a 610G-A transition in exon 4 on the second
allele resulting in a gly204-to-ser substitution (G204S; 612799.0004).

EARS2, GLU96LYS

In 3 patients from 2 unrelated families with COXPD12 (614924), Steenweg
et al. (2012) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the
EARS2 gene: a 286G-A transition in exon 2, resulting in a glu96-to-lys
(E96K) substitution, and a 500G-A transition in exon 4, resulting in a
cys167-to-tyr (C167Y; 612799.0006) substitution. One of the families was
of Belgian descent and the other was of Brazilian descent.

EARS2, LYS65GLU

In a Turkish boy, born of consanguineous parents, with severe COXPD12
(614924), Talim et al. (2012) identified a homozygous 193A-G transition
in the EARS2 gene, resulting in a lys65-to-glu (K65E) substitution. The
mutation was found by exome sequencing and was not identified in 157
controls or in the 1000 Genomes Project database. The patient had
multiple congenital anomalies and multisystem dysfunction resulting in
death at age 3 months. He presented with hypotonia, failure to thrive,
and lactic acidosis in the neonatal period. Brain MRI at age 1 month
showed dysgenesis in the posterior part of corpus callosum; white matter
abnormalities were not noted. He did not have seizures, but did not
achieve any motor milestones. Other features included hepatomegaly,
elevated liver enzymes, and mild hypertrophy of the cardiac
interventricular septum. Skeletal muscle biopsy showed ragged-red and
ragged-blue fibers, COX deficiency, and severe combined deficiency of
respiratory chain complexes I and IV.
