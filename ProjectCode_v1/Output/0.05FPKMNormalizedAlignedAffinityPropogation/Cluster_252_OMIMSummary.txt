;;GCSF-INDUCED GENE 1; GIG1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Activated natural killer (NK) cells and T cells share many cytolytic
components and surface antigens. By a combination of differential and
subtractive hybridization strategies, Turman et al. (1993) isolated a
cDNA encoding NKG7. The deduced 148-amino acid type I integral
transmembrane protein has a signal sequence, a 38-residue external
domain with multiple T-cell epitopes but no N-glycosylation sites or
cysteine residues, and a 64-amino acid cytoplasmic domain with several
phosphorylation sites. Northern blot analysis detected expression of a
0.9-kb transcript in activated NK and T cells, as well as in kidney,
liver, lung, and pancreas.

Using differential hybridization of mononuclear cells from a myelogenous
leukemia patient in chronic phase, Shimane et al. (1994) obtained a cDNA
encoding granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF, or CSF3;
138970)-induced gene-1, or GIG1. Sequence analysis predicted that the
165-amino acid protein contains 4 repetitive hydrophobic regions.
Northern blot analysis revealed a 0.9-kb transcript primarily in myeloid
cell lines.

MAPPING

By Southern blot analysis, Turman et al. (1993) localized the
single-copy NKG7 gene to chromosome 19.

606892	TITLE *606892 SYNTAXIN 12; STX12
;;STX13
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database analysis, Advani et al. (1998) identified syntaxin-12, which
they called syntaxin-13. They cloned STX12 cDNA from a rat brainstem and
spinal cord cDNA library using a human brain cDNA clone as probe. Rat
STX12 shares 53% sequence identity with STX7 (603217). Northern blot
analysis detected expression of a 2.9-kb transcript in rat brain, with
very little expression in other tissues. Western blot analysis detected
a 33-kD band in brain, a faint signal in pancreas, and barely detectable
signals in other tissues. Cell fractionation studies of rat brain showed
that STX12 is an integral membrane protein, and immunolocalization
studies localized STX12 to the cell body of cultured rat hippocampal
neurons. Tang et al. (1998) independently cloned rat STX12 from a rat
brain cDNA library. Northern blot analysis detected highest expression
in brain, lung, and kidney. Immunolocalization studies showed compact
perinuclear staining, and experimental manipulation revealed specific
localization of STX12 to the endosomal compartment.

GENE FUNCTION

Using immunocytochemistry, fluorescence, and confocal microscopy,
Collins et al. (2002) showed that STX7 and STX12 are involved in the
ordered fusion of endosomes and lysosomes with the phagosome, where
phagocytic cells kill and degrade internalized foreign particles. STX12
is localized to the recycling endosome compartment, while STX7 is found
in late endosomes and lysosomes and both are recruited to the phagosome.
However, STX12 is acquired earlier before rapidly recycling off the
phagosome, while STX7 is recruited later and continues to accumulate
throughout the phagosome maturation process.

;;PROTEIN INHIBITOR OF ACTIVATED STAT X; PIASX;;
MIZ1
PIASX-ALPHA, INCLUDED;;
PIASX-BETA, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

STAT proteins (e.g., STAT1, 600555) are latent cytoplasmic transcription
factors that become activated by tyrosine phosphorylation in response to
cytokine stimulation. By searching an EST database and by cDNA library
screening, Liu et al. (1998) identified cDNAs encoding PIASX and several
other mammalian proteins related to PIAS1 (protein inhibitor of
activated STAT1; 603566). The authors found that the PIASX transcript is
alternatively spliced to yield 2 protein isoforms, PIASX-alpha and
PIASX-beta, that differ in their C-terminal regions. Like other members
of the PIAS family, the predicted PIASX proteins contain a putative
zinc-binding motif and a highly acidic region.

Tussie-Luna et al. (2002) reported that mouse Piasx-beta has an
N-terminal SAP domain, followed by a proline-rich region, a RING-like
zinc finger domain, 2 nuclear localization signals, and a
serine/threonine-rich C-terminal domain. Mouse Piasx-beta localized in
the nucleus.

GENE FUNCTION

Tussie-Luna et al. (2002) found that mouse Piasx-beta interacted with
both TFII-I (GTF2I; 601679), a transcriptional activator, and MUSTRD1
(GTF2IRD1; 604318), a transcriptional repressor. Binding of Piasx-beta
to TFII-I augmented TFII-I transcriptional activity. Piasx-beta-TFII-I
interaction could be titrated out by MUSTRD1, leading to transcriptional
repression of TFII-I-dependent promoters.

Yang and Sharrocks (2006) identified human PIASX-alpha as a key
regulator that determines the differential response of the transcription
factor ELK1 (311040) to activation of the ERK (see MAPK3; 601795) or
stress-activated p38 MAP kinase (MAPK14; 600289) pathways. In response
to ERK pathway activation, PIASX-alpha functioned as a coactivator to
facilitate removal of SUMO (see 601912) and HDAC2 (605164) from ELK1.
PIASX-alpha acted in the opposite manner, inhibiting loss of SUMO and
HDAC2 from ELK1, in response to p38 MAP kinase pathway activation.
Phosphorylation of PIASX-alpha through the p38 MAP kinase pathway
allowed it to switch between these alternative functions.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the PIASX
gene to chromosome 18q12.1-q12.3 (TMAP sts-H25373).

607960	TITLE *607960 DEAH BOX POLYPEPTIDE 32; DHX32
;;DDX32
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

DHX32 is a member of the DEAH subfamily of DEAD box proteins, which are
putative RNA helicases characterized by a conserved helicase domain
consisting of 7 to 8 conserved motifs.

CLONING

By database searching with the consensus sequence of the helicase domain
of human DHX15 (603403) as the initial query, Abdelhaleem (2002)
identified DHX32, which they called DDX32. The deduced 743-amino acid
protein has a predicted molecular mass of 84.4 kD. They also identified
an alternatively spliced transcript encoding a deduced protein lacking
81 amino acids (284 to 364). The helicase domain of DHX32 has a novel
sequence including a signature sequence of DDIH in motif II and several
substitutions in other motifs. Abdelhaleem (2002) also cloned the mouse
ortholog of DHX32, which shares 84% overall sequence identity with the
human protein. Northern blot analysis detected an approximately 3-kb
DHX32 transcript in all tissues tested. DHX32 was also detected in all
acute myeloid leukemia cell lines tested. RT-PCR analysis showed that
DHX32 is specifically downregulated in acute lymphoblastic leukemias.

GENE STRUCTURE

Abdelhaleem (2002) determined that the DHX32 gene contains 11 exons and
spans 45 kb. The smaller DDX32 transcript is produced by alternative
splicing of the full-length message with the exclusion of exon 4.

Meng et al. (2003) determined that the seven 3-prime exons of the DHX32
gene overlap the last 3 exons of the BCCIP gene (611883) on the opposite
strand.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Abdelhaleem (2002) mapped the DHX32 gene to
chromosome 10q26.

610210	TITLE *610210 MAF1, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; MAF1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Pluta et al. (2001) identified orthologs of yeast Maf1 in human,
animals, plants, and lower eukaryotes, but not in prokaryotes. Human
MAF1 contains 3 regions conserved in Maf1 proteins, followed by an
acidic C-terminal tail. The second conserved region includes a putative
nuclear targeting signal.

GENE FUNCTION

In yeast, Maf1 affects tRNA suppressor efficiency and interacts with RNA
polymerase III (pol III; see 606007). Pluta et al. (2001) found that
tRNA levels were elevated in Maf1 mutant yeast cells. The in vitro rate
of pol III RNA synthesis was significantly increased in Maf1 mutant cell
extracts. Pluta et al. (2001) concluded that Maf1 is a repressor of pol
III synthesis.

Upadhya et al. (2002) found that yeast signaling pathways activated in
response to rapamycin-induced nutrient limitation, DNA damage, and
secretory defects, as well as the normal yeast growth cycle, required
Maf1 to affect pol III transcriptional repression. They identified
TFIIIB (see 607013) as a target of Maf1-dependent repression.

Oficjalska-Pham et al. (2006) and Roberts et al. (2006) found that yeast
Maf1 was phosphorylated under favorable conditions, whereas diverse
unfavorable conditions led to rapid Maf1 dephosphorylation, nuclear
localization, and physical association of dephosphorylated Maf1 with pol
III.

Using immunoprecipitation analysis, Reina et al. (2006) showed that
human MAF1 interacted with pol III. Protein pull-down assays showed that
MAF1 interacted strongly with the pol I (see 602000) and pol III subunit
RPAC2 (POLR1D; 613715). It interacted more weakly with the pol III
subunit RPC1 (POLR3A) and with BRAF1 (164757). Mutation analysis
revealed that the N-terminal region of MAF1 interacted with the pol III
subunits and that the second conserved domain, the B box, interacted
with BRAF1. MAF1 did not interact with promoter-bound pol III. Knockdown
of MAF1 via RNA interference increased the levels of precursor tRNAs in
HEK293 cells and IMR-90 human lung fibroblasts. Cell stress in HEK293 or
IMR-90 cells reduced the level of MAF1 phosphorylation, and
dephosphorylation of MAF1 was required for pol III repression following
cell stress.

Johnson et al. (2007) showed that human MAF1 negatively regulated
transcription by all 3 nuclear RNA polymerases. Changes in MAF1
expression affected pol I- and pol III-dependent transcription in human
glioblastoma cell lines. These effects were mediated, in part, through
the ability of MAF1 to repress transcription of TATA-binding protein
(TBP; 600075). MAF1 targeted an ELK1 (311040)-binding site in the TBP
promoter, and binding at this site was reciprocal with that of ELK1.
Similarly, MAF1 occupancy of pol III genes was inversely correlated with
that of the initiation factor TFIIIB and pol III. The phenotypic
consequences of reducing MAF1 expression included changes in cell
morphology and accumulation of actin stress fibers, whereas MAF1
overexpression suppressed anchorage-independent growth.

Vannini et al. (2010) found that dephosphorylated yeast Maf1 bound the
Pol III clamp region and rearranged the Pol III subunits involved in
promoter recognition and initiation at the active center cleft. Binding
impaired recruitment of Pol III to a complex of initiation factors and
Pol III promoter DNA. Phosphorylation of a mobile sequence of Maf1
masked a nuclear localization signal, and dephosphorylation following
cell stress was predicted to permit Maf1 nuclear import. This mechanism
appeared to be conserved between yeast and human MAF1, although the
phosphorylation site within the mobile sequence differed.

MAPPING

Hartz (2011) mapped the MAF1 gene to chromosome 8q24.3 based on an
alignment of the sequence (GenBank GENBANK AL136937) with the genomic
sequence (GRCh37).

;;AMP-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE, NONCATALYTIC, GAMMA-2;;
AMPK-GAMMA-2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The mammalian 5-prime-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) appears to act
as a metabolic stress-sensing protein kinase. AMPK is a heterotrimeric
protein composed of a catalytic alpha subunit, a noncatalytic beta
subunit, and a noncatalytic gamma subunit. See PRKAA1 (602739) for
background.

CLONING

By searching an EST database with PRKAG1 (602742) as the probe, followed
by PCR screening of cDNA libraries, Lang et al. (2000) identified a cDNA
encoding PRKAG2. Sequence analysis predicted that the 328-amino acid
protein, which is 76% identical to PRKAG1, contains 4 conserved
cystathionine-beta-synthase domains but lacks N-linked glycosylation
sites. Lang et al. (2000) noted that the entire PRKAG2 amino acid
sequence is identical to a part of the 569-amino acid PRKAG2 sequence
reported by Cheung et al. (2000), suggesting the existence of different
promoters. They designated the long and short PRKAG2 isoforms PRKAG2a
and PRKAG2b, respectively. Genomic sequence analysis determined that
PRKAG2b spans 80 kb and contains 12 exons. Northern blot analysis
detected a specific 2.4-kb PRKAG2b transcript that was most abundantly
expressed in heart, followed by testis and placenta; it was not
expressed in liver and thymus. A 3.8-kb PRKAG2a transcript was expressed
in liver, but not in heart, placenta, or thymus, and a 3.0-kb PRKAG2a
transcript was expressed at extremely high levels in heart and at lower
levels in skeletal muscle, kidney, spleen, and testis.

MAPPING

Stapleton et al. (1997) identified human ESTs encoding human
AMPK-gamma-2. They noted that the AMPK-gamma-2 gene was mapped to
7q35-q36 by Genethon. By radiation hybrid analysis, Lang et al. (2000)
mapped the PRKAG2 gene to 7q36.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 2 apparently unrelated families with autosomal dominant
Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW; 194200), Gollob et al. (2001)
identified a mutation in the PRKAG2 gene (R302Q; 602743.0001).

Blair et al. (2001) identified heterozygous mutations in the PRKAG2 gene
in 2 families with severe hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (CMH6; 600858), in
which some affected individuals also displayed Wolff-Parkinson-White
ventricular preexcitation. Both mutations, H142A (602743.0002) and a
3-bp insertion (602743.0003), occur in highly conserved regions. Because
AMPK provides a central sensing mechanism that protects cells from
exhaustion of ATP supplies, Blair et al. (2001) proposed that energy
compromise may provide a unifying pathogenic mechanism in all forms of
CMH.

Sinha et al. (2000) reported a family in which 12 persons had
ventricular preexcitation, 6 of whom also had cardiac hypertrophy. Three
patients underwent successful ablation of typical accessory
atrioventricular bundles, with subsequent loss of preexcitation. Gollob
et al. (2001) demonstrated the presence of the R302Q mutation of PRKAG2
in this kindred.

Reports that dominant mutations in PRKAG2, an enzyme that modulates
glucose uptake and glycolysis, can cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
challenged the hypothesis that hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a disease
of the sarcomere. In addition to cardiac hypertrophy, individuals with
PRKAG2 mutations frequently manifest electrophysiologic abnormalities,
particularly Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (Gollob et al., 2001),
atrial fibrillation, and progressive development of atrioventricular
conduction block. Although atrial fibrillation is common in CMH patients
and becomes increasingly prevalent with disease duration, neither
accessory pathway nor conduction system diseases are typical features of
CMH. To understand the mechanisms by which PRKAG2 defects cause disease,
Arad et al. (2002) defined additional novel mutations (T400N,
602743.0004; N488I, 602743.0005) and examined the clinical
manifestations found in affected individuals. A previously unrecognized
and unusual histopathology was identified in hearts with PRKAG2 defects,
which prompted biochemical analyses of the functional consequences of
human PRKAG2 mutations on Snf4, the yeast homolog of the gamma-2 protein
kinase subunit. Arad et al. (2002) concluded that their data indicated
that PRKAG2 defects do not cause CMH, but rather a novel glycogen
storage disease of the heart. They found that although the cardiac
pathology caused by the PRKAG2 mutations R302Q, T400N, and N488I
included myocyte enlargement and minimal interstitial fibrosis, these
mutations were not associated with myocyte and myofibrillar disarray,
the pathognomonic features of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy caused by
sarcomere protein mutations. Instead, PRKAG2 mutations caused pronounced
vacuole formation within myocytes. Several lines of evidence indicated
that these vacuoles are filled with glycogen-associated granules.
Analyses of the effects of human PRKAG2 mutations on Snf1/Snf4 kinase
function demonstrated constitutive activity, which could foster glycogen
accumulation. Thus, this disorder is a metabolic storage disease in
which hypertrophy, ventricular preexcitation, and conduction system
defects coexist. Support for the hypothesis that human PRKAG2 missense
mutations cause an increase in AMP kinase activity and stimulate
carbohydrate accumulation also comes from analyses of RN- pigs (Milan et
al., 2000; Hamilton et al., 2001). RN- pigs produce 'acid meat' that is
of inferior quality due to increased muscle glycogen content. The
porcine RN- mutation is analogous to the human PRKAG2 mutation
arg302-to-gln (602743.0001).

In 3 of 5 patients with fatal congenital heart glycogenosis (261740), 1
of whom had previously been reported by Regalado et al. (1999),
Burwinkel et al. (2005) identified heterozygosity for an arg531-to-gln
mutation in the PRKAG2 gene (R531Q; 602743.0007). The patients died of
hemodynamic and respiratory failure secondary to hypertrophic
nonobstructive cardiomyopathy but also had Wolff-Parkinson-White
syndrome-like conduction anomalies. Biochemical characterization of the
mutant protein showed a greater than 100-fold reduction of binding
affinities for the regulatory nucleotides AMP and ATP but an enhanced
basal activity and increased phosphorylation of the alpha subunit.
Burwinkel et al. (2005) noted that the molecular abnormalities of the
R531Q mutant protein are more pronounced than those of other PRKAG2
mutants, which likely accounts for the more severe phenotype with fetal
onset, extreme cardiomegaly, and a fatal outcome in infancy.

Arad et al. (2005) analyzed the PRKAG2 gene in 35 patients with
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy who were negative for mutations in known
sarcomere-protein genes, and identified a heterozygous missense mutation
(Y487H; 602743.0008) in 1 proband with moderate hypertrophy and an
extremely short PR interval.

In a 38-year-old man with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, severe conduction
system abnormalities, and mild skeletal muscle glycogenosis, who was
negative for mutation in the LMNA gene (150330), Laforet et al. (2006)
identified heterozygosity for a mutation in the PRKAG2 gene
(602743.0011). The authors suggested that PRKAG2 could be a candidate
for unexplained skeletal muscle glycogenosis associated with cardiac
abnormalities.

In a child with idiopathic cardiac hypertrophy and presumed sporadic
cardiomyopathy, who was negative for mutations in 9 of the known CMH
genes, Morita et al. (2008) identified heterozygosity for a missense
mutation in the PRKAG2 gene (H530R; 602743.0009).

Kelly et al. (2009) reported a father, son, and daughter with
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in whom they identified heterozygosity for a
missense mutation in the PRKAG2 gene (E506Q; 602743.0010).
Endomyocardial tissue from the son showed a normal amount of glycogen
present in the myocytes by staining and electron microscopy. Kelly et
al. (2009) stated that 8 affected members of a family reported by Bayrak
et al. (2006) with a PRKAG2 mutation at the same codon (E506K) had
ventricular preexcitation and mild left ventricular hypertrophy;
endomyocardial biopsy of the adult proband showed profound intracellular
vacuolization and marked interstitial fibrosis. Noting that in the
patients reported by Burwinkel et al. (2005), the approximately 4- to
6-fold increase in cardiac mass was associated with only a 3-fold
increase in glycogen content and an absence of more organized cellular
aggregations of glycogen, Kelly et al. (2009) concluded that CMH due to
PRKAG2 mutations may have a degree of cardiac hypertrophy exceeding that
expected from observed amounts of glycogen deposition.

ANIMAL MODEL

Arad et al. (2003) constructed transgenic mice overexpressing the PRKAG2
cDNA with or without a missense N488I human mutation (602743.0005). The
transgenic mice showed elevated AMP-activated protein kinase activity,
accumulated large amounts of cardiac glycogen, developed dramatic left
ventricular hypertrophy, and exhibited ventricular preexcitation and
sinus node dysfunction. Electrophysiologic testing demonstrated
alternative atrioventricular conduction pathways consistent with
Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Cardiac histopathology revealed that the
annulus fibrosis, which normally insulates the ventricles from
inappropriate excitation by the atria, was disrupted by glycogen-filled
myocytes. Arad et al. (2003) concluded that these data establish that
PRKAG2 mutations cause a glycogen storage cardiomyopathy, provide an
anatomic explanation for electrophysiologic findings, and implicate
disruption of the annulus fibrosis by glycogen-engorged myocytes as the
cause of preexcitation in Pompe (232300), Danon (300257), and other
glycogen storage diseases.

Sidhu et al. (2005) generated transgenic mice expressing the human
PRKAG2 gene containing the arg302-to-gln (R302Q; 602743.0001) mutation
and observed a phenotype identical to that of Wolff-Parkinson-White
syndrome, including preexcitation, inducible orthodromic AV reentrant
tachycardia, cardiac hypertrophy, and excessive cardiac glycogen. The
primary molecular defect was loss of cardiac AMPK activity, which
appeared to be due to disruption of the gamma-2 subunit binding site for
AMP.

individuals had ventricular preexcitation and 6 of those also had
cardiac hypertrophy (CMH6; 600858), Gollob et al. (2001) demonstrated
the presence of the R302Q mutation in the PRKAG2 gene.

In 43 affected individuals from 4 unrelated families with cardiac
hypertrophy, 1 of which was previously reported by Mehdirad et al.
(1999), Arad et al. (2002) identified the R302Q mutation in exon 7 of
the PRKAG2 gene. Most of the patients had hypertrophy associated with
WPW (65%) and/or other conduction system disease (atrioventricular
block, 37%; sinus bradycardia, 12%); however, 5 patients from 2 of the
families had only WPW without cardiac hypertrophy. Twenty (47%) of the
43 affected individuals had undergone pacemaker implantation.
Histopathology revealed enlarged myocytes but no myofiber disarray, and
there were large, isolated cytosolic vacuoles within cardiomyocytes;
electron microscopy showed the vacuoles to be filled with densely packed
fine granular and fibrillar electron-dense material. Arad et al. (2002)
noted that such pathologic findings in the heart were typical of those
seen in type IV glycogenosis (232500) and polyglucosan body disease
(263570) and had also been found in hearts of patients with adult-onset
Pompe disease (232300).

PRKAG2, HIS142ARG

In 3 affected members of a family with early-onset hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy (600858), 2 of whom also displayed Wolff-Parkinson-White
ventricular preexcitation with a 'very large and bizarre' QRS pattern,
Blair et al. (2001) identified heterozygosity for an A-G transition in
exon 7 of the PRKAG2 gene, resulting in a his142-to-arg (H142R)
substitution at a highly conserved residue in the second
cystathionine-beta-synthase domain. The mutation was not found in more
than 240 control chromosomes. One patient underwent cardiac
transplantation at 19 years of age.

CARDIOMYOPATHY, FAMILIAL HYPERTROPHIC, 6
PRKAG2, 3-BP INS, 327TTA

In 5 affected members of a 3-generation family with severe hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy (600858), Blair et al. (2001) identified heterozygosity
for a 3-bp insertion (TTA) after the codon for arginine-109 in exon 5 of
the PRKAG2 gene, predicting the insertion of a leucine residue. Three of
the 5 patients underwent sudden death at 32 years, 38 years, and 51
years of age; 1 of those had symptomatic Wolff-Parkinson-White
ventricular preexcitation requiring treatment with ablation. The 2
remaining patients also had conduction and electrocardiographic
abnormalities: atrial fibrillation with left ventricular bundle branch
block and atrioventricular block requiring pacemaker insertion, and a
short PR interval with broad QRS and T wave inversion, respectively.

.0004
CARDIOMYOPATHY, FAMILIAL HYPERTROPHIC, 6
PRKAG2, THR400ASN

In a 42-year-old woman with cardiac hypertrophy associated with
Wolff-Parkinson-White ventricular preexcitation and sinus bradycardia
requiring pacemaker implantation (CMH6; 600858), Arad et al. (2002)
identified heterozygosity for a 1289C-A transversion in the PRKAG2 gene,
resulting in a thr400-to-asn (T400N) substitution at a highly conserved
residue. The mutation was not found in her unaffected mother or sister
or in 200 control samples; no DNA was available from her deceased and
reportedly unaffected father.

PRKAG2, ASN488ILE

In 24 affected individuals from a large family with hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy mapping to chromosome 7q3 (600858), originally reported
by MacRae et al. (1995), Arad et al. (2002) identified heterozygosity
for a 1553A-T transition in the PRKAG2 gene, resulting in an
asn488-to-ile (N488I) substitution at a highly conserved residue. The
mutation segregated with disease in the family and was not found in 200
control samples. Three of the patients with hypertrophy also had
Wolff-Parkinson-White ventricular preexcitation and several others had
various forms of conduction disease; 1 mutation-positive individual had
WPW and conduction disease without cardiac hypertrophy.

.0006
WOLFF-PARKINSON-WHITE SYNDROME, CHILDHOOD-ONSET
PRKAG2, ARG531GLY

Gollob et al. (2001) reported a 3-generation family segregating
Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (194200). The proband had experienced
recurrent syncope since the age of 2, at which age he was noted to have
ventricular preexcitation on resting ECG. He subsequently developed
paroxysms of atrial fibrillation with ventricular escape rhythms of
right bundle branch block morphology before developing chronic atrial
fibrillation. Echocardiography at the age of 43 demonstrated normal
ventricular architecture. Three other immediate relatives were affected.
Analysis of the PRKAG2 gene revealed a 1681C-G transversion in exon 15,
resulting in an arg531-to-gly (R531G) substitution. (The numbering
systems used by Gollob et al. (2001) and Burwinkel et al. (2005) (see
602743.0007) differ.)

.0007
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE OF HEART, LETHAL CONGENITAL
PRKAG2, ARG531GLN

In 3 sporadic, unrelated patients with lethal congenital glycogen
storage disease of the heart (261740), 1 of whom was previously reported
by Regalado et al. (1999), Burwinkel et al. (2005) identified
heterozygosity for a 1592G-A transition of the PRKAG2 gene, resulting in
an arg531-to-gln (R531Q) substitution. Biochemical characterization of
the mutant protein showed a greater than 100-fold reduction of binding
affinities for the regulatory nucleotides AMP and ATP but an enhanced
basal activity and increased phosphorylation of the alpha-subunit.
Burwinkel et al. (2005) noted that the molecular abnormalities of the
R531Q mutant protein are more pronounced than those of other PRKAG2
mutants, which likely accounts for the more severe phenotype. (The
numbering system used by Burwinkel et al. (2005) and Gollob et al.
(2001) (see 602743.0006) differ.)

CARDIOMYOPATHY, FAMILIAL HYPERTROPHIC, 6
PRKAG2, TYR487HIS

In a brother and sister with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (600858), Arad
et al. (2005) identified heterozygosity for a tyr487-to-his (Y487H)
substitution in the PRKAG2 gene. Their maternal uncle had undergone
sudden cardiac death. The proband had moderate hypertrophy with a left
ventricular wall thickness of 13 mm and an extremely short PR interval
(0.09 msec).

.0009
CARDIOMYOPATHY, FAMILIAL HYPERTROPHIC, 6
PRKAG2, HIS530ARG

In a child with idiopathic cardiac hypertrophy and presumed sporadic
cardiomyopathy (600858), who was negative for mutations in 9 of the
known CMH genes, Morita et al. (2008) identified heterozygosity for an
A-to-G transition in the PRKAG2 gene, resulting in a his530-to-arg
(H530R) substitution. (The parents were not studied.) The mutation was
not found in unrelated individuals matched by ancestral origin or in
more than 1,000 control chromosomes.

CARDIOMYOPATHY, FAMILIAL HYPERTROPHIC, 6
PRKAG2, GLU506GLN

In a father, son, and daughter with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (CMH6;
600858), Kelly et al. (2009) identified heterozygosity for a
glu506-to-gln (E506Q) substitution in exon 14 of the PRKAG2 gene. The
father had undergone cardiac transplantation at 29 years of age for
cardiomypathy; the 6-year-old daughter, who had 'prominent forces' on
electrocardiography, was shown to have left ventricular mass in the 90th
percentile for body surface area by 2-D echocardiography. The son
presented at 6 months of age with a cardiac murmur and was found to have
ventricular preexcitation and severe biventricular CMH requiring septal
myectomy. Endomyocardial biopsy samples from the son did not demonstrate
significant glycogen accumulation.

PRKAG2, SER548PRO

In a 38-year-old man with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, severe conduction
system abnormalities, and mild skeletal muscle glycogenosis (CMH6;
600858), Laforet et al. (2006) identified heterozygosity for a 1732T-C
transition in the PRKAG2 gene, resulting in a ser548-to-pro (S548P)
substitution at a highly conserved residue in the fourth CBS domain. The
mutation was not found in his unaffected brother or in 200 control
chromosomes.

610822	TITLE *610822 SOLUTE CARRIER FAMILY 25, MEMBER 41; SLC25A41
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SLC25A41 belongs to the SLC25 family of mitochondrial carrier proteins
(Haitina et al., 2006).

CLONING

By searching databases for SLC25 family members, Haitina et al. (2006)
identified 2 splice variants of SLC25A41. The deduced protein contains
314 amino acids. Quantitative real-time PCR of rat tissues detected
highest expression of Slc25a41 in liver, testis, and all brain coronal
sections examined, with weaker expression in epididymis. No expression
was detected in other tissues examined.

GENE STRUCTURE

Haitina et al. (2006) determined that the SLC25A41 gene contains 6
exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Haitina et al. (2006) mapped the human
SLC25A41 gene to chromosome 19. They mapped the mouse gene to chromosome
17.

604439	TITLE *604439 GRB2-ASSOCIATED BINDING PROTEIN 1; GAB1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

GAB1 is a member of the GAB/DOS ('Daughter of Sevenless') family of
adaptor molecules, which contain a pleckstrin homology domain and
potential binding sites for SH2 and SH3 domains.

CLONING

Using a radioactively labeled GRB2 (108355) fusion protein to screen an
expression glial tumor cDNA library, Holgado-Madruga et al. (1996)
identified a cDNA encoding a deduced 694-amino acid protein, which they
termed GAB1, with a molecular mass of 77 kD. The GAB1 protein shares
amino acid sequence homology and several structural features with the
IRS1 protein (147545). The greatest homology (31% identity and 44%
similarity) is in the pleckstrin homology domain in the N terminus of
both proteins. The distal two-thirds of both proteins have numerous
predicted serine/threonine phosphorylation sites and several potential
phosphotyrosine sites, suggesting that, like IRS1, GAB1 is a docking
protein. Northern blot analysis revealed 2 GAB1 transcripts of 4.2 and 7
kb in all tissues examined except liver, lung, and kidney. The authors
suggested that the larger transcript may represent alternative splicing
or a related gene. They found that GAB1 transcripts were more easily
detected than those of IRS1, suggesting that GAB1 is more prevalent than
IRS1.

GENE FUNCTION

By Far Western blot analysis, Holgado-Madruga et al. (1996) showed that
GRB2 bound to a 100-kD protein from bacterial cells transformed with the
proline/serine-rich fragment of GAB1. In vitro kinase assays
demonstrated that GAB1 is a direct substrate of the epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR; 131550) and the insulin receptor (INSR; 147670).
Tyrosine phosphorylation of GAB1 mediates interaction with several
proteins that contain SH2 domains.

GAB1 is tyrosine phosphorylated upon stimulation of various cytokines,
growth factors, and antigen receptors in cell lines and interacts with
signaling molecules such as SHP2 (176876) and phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase (e.g., 171833) (Holgado-Madruga et al., 1996, 1997).

Nakaoka et al. (2003) investigated the role of GAB1 in gp130-mediated
cardiac hypertrophy. Stimulation with leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF;
159540) induced tyrosine phosphorylation of GAB1, and phosphorylated
GAB1 interacted with SHP2 and p85 in cultured cardiomyocytes. Using 3
adenovirus vectors (carrying wildtype GAB1, mutated GAB1 lacking the
SHP2-binding site, and beta-galactosidase), they showed that GAB1 plays
a critical role in elongation of cardiomyocytes induced by LIF through
interaction with SHP2, and that the interaction of GAB1 with SHP2 is
involved not only in the regulation of brain natriuretic polypeptide
(NPPB; 600295) and skeletal alpha-actin (ACTA1; 102610) gene expression
but also in the activation of ERK5 (MAPK7; 602521) after stimulation
with LIF in cardiomyocytes. Coinfection of adenovirus vectors carrying
wildtype GAB1 and dominant-negative ERK5 abrogated the LIF-induced
cardiomyocyte elongation. Nakaoka et al. (2003) concluded that GAB1-SHP2
interaction plays a crucial role in gp130-dependent longitudinal
elongation of cardiomyocytes through activation of ERK5.

MAPPING

By FISH, Yamada et al. (2001) mapped the GAB1 gene to human chromosome
4q13.1 and mouse chromosome 8C3.

ANIMAL MODEL

To reveal the functions of Gab1 in vivo, Itoh et al. (2000) generated
mice lacking Gab1 by gene targeting. Gab1-deficient embryos died in
utero and displayed developmental defects in the heart, placenta, and
skin, which were similar to phenotypes observed in mice lacking signals
of the hepatocyte growth factor (142409), platelet-derived growth factor
(e.g., 173430), and epidermal growth factor (131530) pathways.
Consistent with these observations, extracellular signal-regulated
kinase mitogen-activated protein kinases (ERK MAPKs) were activated at
much lower levels in cells from Gab1-deficient embryos in response to
these growth factors or to stimulation of the cytokine receptor gp130
(IL6ST; 600694). Itoh et al. (2000) concluded that Gab1 is a common
player in a broad range of growth factor and cytokine signaling pathways
linking ERK MAP kinase activation.

Vasyutina et al. (2005) found that Cxcr4 (162643)-positive muscle
progenitor cells reach the anlage of the tongue in Gab1-null or
Cxcr4-null mouse embryos, but not in Cxcr4/Gab1 double mutants,
suggesting that these proteins interact during progenitor cell
migration.

607375	TITLE *607375 DOT1-LIKE; DOT1L
;;DOT1, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; DOT1;;
HISTONE H3 METHYLTRANSFERASE DOT1-LIKE;;
KIAA1814
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult hippocampus
cDNA library, Nagase et al. (2001) cloned a partial DOT1L cDNA, which
they called KIAA1814. RT-PCR followed by ELISA revealed variable but
ubiquitous expression. Highest levels were detected in lung, testis, and
kidney. Moderate to high levels were found in whole brain and in most
individual brain regions tested.

By searching an EST database for sequences homologous to yeast Dot1,
Feng et al. (2002) obtained a full-length cDNA encoding DOT1L. The
deduced 1,537-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 165
kD and contains a SAM (sterile alpha motif) domain for protein-protein
interaction. DOT1L does not, however, have the SET domain found in most
histone lysine methyltransferases.

GENE FUNCTION

By in vitro assay of recombinant protein, Feng et al. (2002) determined
that DOT1L is inactive against free core histones, but shows significant
histone methyltransferase activity against nucleosomes. Analysis of
truncated protein or protein mutated within the SAM domain demonstrated
that DOT1L is a nucleosomal histone-3 (H3; see 602810)-specific
methyltransferase that requires the SAM and sequences between amino
acids 351 and 472 for activity. Overexpression of DOT1L in human
embryonic kidney cells significantly increased methylation of lys79 of
H3, but had no effect on lys4 or lys9. Methylation of lys79, attributed
to DOT1L, was regulated during the cell cycle in synchronized HeLa
cells. Levels decreased during S phase, reached their lowest point in
G2, rose during M phase, and remained high throughout G1.

McGinty et al. (2008) demonstrated direct stimulation of DOT1L-mediated
intranucleosomal methylation of H3 at lysine-79 using chemically
ubiquitylated H2B (see 609904). Two traceless orthogonal expressed
protein ligation (EPL) reactions were used for site-specific H2B
ubiquitylation. Reconstitution of ubiquitylated H2B into chemically
defined nucleosomes, followed by biochemical analysis, revealed that
ubiquitylated H2B directly activated methylation of H3 lysine-79 by
DOT1L and was mediated by the DOT1L catalytic domain, most likely
through allosteric mechanisms. Asymmetric incorporation of ubiquitylated
H2B into dinucleosomes showed that enhancement of methylation was
limited to nucleosomes bearing ubiquitylated H2B. McGinty et al. (2008)
concluded that their work demonstrates a direct biochemical crosstalk
between 2 modifications on separate histone proteins within a
nucleosome.

Onder et al. (2012) used short hairpin RNAs to target genes in DNA and
histone methylation pathways and identified positive and negative
modulators of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) generation.
Inhibition of the H3K79 histone methyltransferase DOT1L by short hairpin
RNA or a small molecule accelerated reprogramming, significantly
increased the yield of iPSC colonies, and substituted for KLF4 (602253)
and c-Myc (190080). Inhibition of DOT1L early in the reprogramming
process is associated with a marked increase in 2 alternative factors,
NANOG (607937) and LIN28 (611043), which play essential functional roles
in the enhancement of reprogramming. Genomewide analysis of H3K79me2
distribution revealed that fibroblast-specific genes associated with the
epithelial to mesenchymal transition lose H3K79me2 in the initial phases
of reprogramming. DOT1L inhibition facilitates the loss of this mark
from genes that are fated to be repressed in the pluripotent state.
Onder et al. (2012) concluded that their findings implicated specific
chromatin-modifying enzymes as barriers to or facilitators of
reprogramming, and demonstrated how modulation of chromatin-modifying
enzymes can be exploited to more efficiently generate iPSCs with fewer
exogenous transcription factors.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Min et al. (2003) solved the 2.5-angstrom resolution structure of the
catalytic domain of human DOT1L in complex with S-adenosyl-L-methionine
(SAM). The structure revealed a unique organization of a mainly
alpha-helical N-terminal domain and a central open alpha/beta structure,
an active site consisting of a SAM-binding pocket, and a potential
lysine-binding channel. The authors showed that a flexible, positively
charged region at the C terminus of the catalytic domain is critical for
nucleosome binding and enzymatic activity.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (2001) mapped the DOT1L gene
to chromosome 19. By genomic sequence analysis, Feng et al. (2002)
mapped the DOT1L gene to chromosome 19p13.3.

602442	TITLE *602442 INTERSECTIN 1; ITSN1
;;ITSN;;
SH3 DOMAIN PROTEIN 1A; SH3D1A;;
SRC HOMOLOGY 3 DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN;;
SH3P17
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Intersectin-1 is an evolutionarily conserved, multidomain protein that
functions in clathrin-associated endocytosis and as a mediator of MAPK
signaling pathways (Tsyba et al., 2004).

CLONING

Chen and Antonarakis (1997) used exon trapping to identify portions of
genes on human chromosome 21. A BLAST search of databases revealed that
1 trapped sequence was identical to a region of the GenBank entry for
the Src homology 3 (SH3) domain-containing gene SH3D1A, formerly called
SH3P17 by Sparks et al. (1996).

By Alu-splice PCR, Pucharcos et al. (1999) trapped 2 exons and
subsequently identified the full-length cDNA of the ITSN gene. The gene
has the potential to code for at least 2 different protein isoforms by
alternative splicing (ITSN-L and ITSN-S). Intersectin exists with a high
degree of similarity in flies, frogs, and mammals, suggesting a
conserved role in higher eukaryotes. ITSN mRNAs were detected in all
adult and fetal tissues tested in human and mouse, with the longer
isoform present in the brain. In situ hybridization studies in the
developing mouse brain showed ITSN expression in both proliferating and
differentiating neurons. Pucharcos et al. (1999) determined the genomic
structure of ITSN using chromosome 21 sequences deposited in the public
databases. The protein contains several known motifs which implicate
ITSN in clathrin-mediated endocytosis and synaptic vesicle recycling.
The expression pattern of intersectin in mouse brain, its presumed
function, and its overexpression in brains from Down syndrome patients,
suggested intersectin may contribute in a gene dosage-dependent manner
to some of the abnormalities of Down syndrome.

Pucharcos et al. (2000) determined by Western blot analysis that the
short and long isoforms of ITSN1 encode 138- and 195-kD proteins,
respectively, as predicted. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated
sparse punctate expression throughout the cytoplasm for both ITSN1 and
ITSN2 (604464), with ITSN1 having a more marked perinuclear pattern and
a concentration in Golgi-like structures.

Tsyba et al. (2004) noted that ITSN1 has a complex domain structure.
Both ITSN1 isoforms have 2 N-terminal Eps15 (600051) homology (EH)
domains, followed by a coiled-coil domain and 5 Src (190090) homology-3
(SH3) domains. In addition, the long isoform has a C-terminal extension
containing a Dbl (311030) homology (DH), or RhoGEF (see 601855), domain,
a pleckstrin (173570) homology (PH) domain, and a putative
calcium-interaction domain. Tsyba et al. (2004) identified 8 additional
alternative splicing events that affect mouse and human ITSN1
transcripts. These splicing events decrease the EH domain spacing,
introduce an insertion in the first SH3 domain, delete the DH domain, or
create frameshifts that truncate the open reading frames at several
points. Tsyba et al. (2004) concluded that alternative splicing
contributes to the regulation of ITSN1 protein functions by creating
diversity in domain composition among protein isoforms.

GENE FUNCTION

Pucharcos et al. (2000) found that overexpression of either of the ITSN2
isoforms or ITSN1 resulted in the inhibition of transferrin uptake and
the blockage of clathrin-mediated endocytosis.

Morphologic changes in neuronal dendritic spines are believed to be
caused by dynamic regulation of actin polymerization. Irie and Yamaguchi
(2002) found that the EphB2 receptor tyrosine kinase (600997) physically
associates with intersectin-1 in cooperation with the actin-regulating
protein N-WASP (605056), which in turn activates the Rho family GTPase
Cdc42 (116952) and spine morphogenesis.

He et al. (2007) showed that mammalian Wnk1 (605232) and Wnk4 (601844)
interacted with Itsn1 and that these interactions were crucial for
stimulation of Romk1 (KCNJ1; 600359) endocytosis. Stimulation of Romk1
endocytosis by Wnk1 and Wnk4 required their proline-rich motifs, but it
did not require their kinase activities. Pseudohypoaldosteronism II
(PHA2B; 614491)-causing mutations in Wnk4 enhanced the interactions of
Wnk4 with Itsn1 and Romk1, leading to increased endocytosis of Romk1.

GENE STRUCTURE

Tsyba et al. (2004) determined that the ITSN1 gene contains 41 exons.
Exon 1 is noncoding, and the initiator methionine is located in exon 2.

MAPPING

By hybridization and PCR, Chen and Antonarakis (1997) mapped the SH3D1A
gene to YACs and cosmids within 21q22.1-q22.2, between DNA markers
D21S319 and D21S65.

608975	TITLE *608975 PARTITIONING-DEFECTIVE PROTEIN 6, C. ELEGANS, HOMOLOG OF, BETA; PARD6B
;;PAR6-BETA
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to C. elegans Par6,
followed by RT-PCR of human renal carcinoma cell line RNA, Noda et al.
(2001) cloned PAR6-beta. The deduced 372-amino acid protein contains a
central CRIB motif and a PDZ domain. Northern blot analysis detected a
4.8-kb transcript expressed at highest levels in adult and fetal kidney,
with much weaker expression in placenta, lung, and liver.

GENE FUNCTION

Noda et al. (2001) found that PAR6-alpha (607484), PAR6-beta, or
PAR6-gamma (608976) could interact directly with GTP-bound RAC (see
602048) or CDC42 (116952) via their CRIB-like motif, and simultaneously
with the atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) isoforms PKC-lambda/iota
(600539) and PKC-zeta (176982) in an N-terminal head-to-head
association. The ternary complexes were formed both in vitro and in
vivo. When any of the PAR6 cDNAs and aPKC were expressed with a
constitutively active form of RAC in HeLa or COS-7 cells, the proteins
colocalized to membrane ruffles.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the PARD6B
gene to chromosome 20 (TMAP SHGC-37653).

;;TSSK5
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TSSK4 belongs to a family of serine/threonine kinases highly expressed
in testis (Chen et al., 2005).

CLONING

By searching databases for TSSK-like sequences, followed by PCR of a
testis cDNA library, Chen et al. (2005) cloned TSSK4, which they called
TSSK5. The deduced 328-amino acid protein is a putative serine/threonine
kinase. Northern blot analysis failed to detect TSSK4 expression, but
RT-PCR revealed TSSK4 expression in testis only.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis and in vitro pull-down experiments, Chen et
al. (2005) showed the TSSK4 interacted with CREB (123810). TSSK4
phosphorylated CREB at ser133 and activated a CRE/CREB reporter gene in
transfected HEK293T cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Chen et al. (2005) determined that the TSSK4 gene contains 4 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Chen et al. (2005) mapped the TSSK4 gene
to chromosome 14q11.2.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The attachment of each of the 20 naturally occurring amino acids to
their cognate tRNA isoaccepting families is catalyzed by a specific
aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase, such as CARS (Cruzen et al., 1993).

MAPPING

Cruzen et al. (1993) assigned the CARS gene to chromosome 11 by analysis

fluorescence in situ hybridization, they refined the location to
chromosome 11p15.5.

CYTOGENETICS

In a patient with ALK (105590)-positive anaplastic large-cell lymphoma,
Cools et al. (2002) identified a t(2;11;2)(p23;p15;q31) rearrangement
that resulted in splicing of exons of the CARS gene from chromosome
11p15 to exons of the ALK gene from chromosome 2p23. The predicted
fusion protein contains 606 N-terminal amino acids of CARS fused to 562
amino acids of ALK, including the ALK kinase domain.

LATENT TRANSFORMING GROWTH FACTOR-BETA-BINDING PROTEIN 4, LONG, INCLUDED;
LTBP4L, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Transforming growth factor-beta, or TGFB (see TGFB1; 190180), remains
biologically latent after secretion, blocked from activity by its
N-terminal propeptide (the latency-associated peptide, or LAP). TGFB is
activated by its dissociation from LAP. The latent form of TGFB is
secreted in association with a latent TGFB-binding protein, or LTBP (see
LTBP1; 150390), and assembled into the extracellular matrix. LTBPs are
mainly composed of epidermal growth factor (EGF; 131530)-like repeats
and protein domains with 8-cysteine repeats, both of which are also
found in fibrillins (e.g., 134797).

See Oklu and Hesketh (2000) for a review of the LTBP gene family.

CLONING

By searching an EST database for cDNAs encoding EGF-like
repeat-containing proteins, Giltay et al. (1997) identified a cDNA
encoding a deduced 1,587-amino acid protein, which they called LTBP4.
Northern blot analysis detected strong expression of an approximately
5-kb LTBP4 transcript in heart, with slightly lower expression in
skeletal muscle and pancreas, moderate expression in placenta and lung,
and weak or no expression in brain, liver, and kidney.

By searching an EST database for cDNAs encoding 8-cysteine
repeat-containing proteins, Saharinen et al. (1998) isolated a human
heart cDNA encoding a deduced 1,511-amino acid protein, which they
termed LTBP4S. The authors also obtained cDNAs encoding 3 alternatively
spliced forms of LTBP4, including a partial cDNA encoding an
N-terminally extended form of LTBP4S that they called LTBP4L. Northern
blot analysis detected a 5.1-kb LTBP4 transcript that was strongly
expressed in heart, uterus, and small intestine, and weakly expressed in
placenta, lung, and skeletal muscle. In addition to these tissues, dot
blot hybridization detected significant levels of LTBP4 mRNA in aorta,
ovary, and adrenal gland. Immunoblot analysis of serum-free medium of
fibroblast cultures detected a proteinase-sensitive LTBP4 protein of 250
kD that binds in a covalent complex with TGFB1-LAP and associates with
extracellular matrix.

MAPPING

By FISH, Saharinen et al. (1998) mapped the LTBP4 gene to chromosome
19q13.1-q13.2.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 4 unrelated patients with cutis laxa and severe pulmonary,
gastrointestinal, and urinary abnormalities (ARCL1C; 613177), Urban et
al. (2009) identified 5 homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in
the LTBP4 gene (604710.0001-604710.0005). Four of the mutations were
predicted to lead to premature termination codons, and one replaced a
highly conserved cysteine in a hybrid domain. Four of the 5 mutations
were located in a hybrid or an 8-cysteine domain, which are known to
have long-range effects on fibrillin and LTBP conformation.

Callewaert et al. (2013) analyzed the FBLN4 (604633), FBLN5 (604580),
and LTBP4 genes in 12 families with type I ARCL and identified
homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the LTBP4 gene in 9
families (see, e.g., 604710.0005-604710.0008). Homozygous mutations in
FLBN5 were identified in 2 families (604580.0010 and 604580.0011,
respectively). No mutations were found in the FBLN4 gene, and no
mutations were detected in 1 family in which the proband had cutis laxa
and bladder diverticula without obvious emphysema. Callewaert et al.
(2013) noted that the FBLN5 and LTBP4 mutations caused a very similar
phenotype associated with severe pulmonary emphysema in the absence of
vascular tortuosity or aneurysms. Gastointestinal and genitourinary
tract involvement seemed to be more severe in patients with LTBP4
mutations.

ANIMAL MODEL

By using a gene trap strategy that selects for integrations into genes
induced transiently during early mouse development, Sterner-Kock et al.
(2002) disrupted the mouse homolog of the human LTBP4 gene. Mice
homozygous for the disrupted allele developed severe pulmonary
emphysema, cardiomyopathy, and colorectal cancer. These highly
tissue-specific abnormalities were associated with profound defects in
the elastic fiber structure and with a reduced deposition of TGF-beta in
the extracellular space, resulting in epithelial cells with reduced
levels of phosphorylated Smad2 (601366) proteins, overexpression of
c-myc (190080), and uncontrolled proliferation. This phenotype supported
the predicted dual role of LTBP4 as a structural component of the
extracellular matrix and as a local regulator of TGF-beta tissue
deposition and signaling.

and a truncated protein (Q1185fsX1211). The mutation occurred in an
8-cysteine domain.

In a patient with cutis laxa and severe pulmonary, gastrointestinal, and

parents, Urban et al. (2009) identified compound heterozygosity for 2
mutations in the LTBP4 gene: a 1-bp deletion (791delC) in exon 9
resulting in a frameshift and a truncated protein (P264fsX300), and a
2-bp insertion/deletion mutation (2570CG-AA) resulting in a
cys857-to-ter (C857X; 604710.0003) substitution. The former mutation
occurred in a hybrid domain.

Palestinian parents, Urban et al. (2009) identified homozygosity for an
820T-G transversion in exon 9 of the LTBP4 gene resulting in a
cys274-to-gly (C274G) substitution. The mutation occurred in a hybrid
domain.

.0005
CUTIS LAXA, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE, TYPE IC
LTBP4, 1-BP INS, 4128C

In a patient with cutis laxa and severe pulmonary, gastrointestinal, and
urinary abnormalities (ARCL1C; 613177), offspring of unrelated Hispanic
parents, Urban et al. (2009) identified compound heterozygosity for 2
mutations in the LTBP4 gene: C857X (604710.0003) and a 1-bp insertion
(4128insC) in exon 33 resulting in a frameshift and a truncated protein
(P1376fsX1403). The latter mutation occurred in an 8-cysteine domain.
Neither mutation was identified in the mother and the father was not
available for study.

In 2 sisters from a consanguineous family who had cutis laxa with
pulmonary and gastrointestinal involvement, Callewaert et al. (2013)
identified homozygosity for a 4127dupC mutation, which they stated was
the same mutation previously reported by Urban et al. (2009). The
mutation was present in heterozygosity in the unaffected parents. The
mother had had 3 spontaneous abortions, and an older brother with
generalized cutis laxa had died after a bowel rupture at 5 days of age.
In addition to cutis laxa, the proband had atrial septal defect with
dysplastic aortic and pulmonary valves, esophageal tortuosity, and
diaphragmatic hernia, and underwent gastric perforation. Her 8-year-old
sister also had bowel perforation which was surgically repaired, and
underwent Nissen fundoplasty and gastrostomy tube placement for volvulus
through a massive hiatal hernia; her other features included mitral
valve prolapse, palpitations, and syncope. Skin fibroblasts from the
proband showed residual expression of mutant LTBP4 mRNA, suggesting
partial escape from nonsense-mediated decay; this was confirmed by
immunoblotting analysis of conditioned media samples from mutant
fibroblasts, in which LTBP4 was detectable using an antibody against the
amino terminus but not with an antibody against the carboxy terminus.
Double immunostaining for LTBP4 and fibrillin-1 (134797) in patient
fibroblasts showed strong extracellular matrix staining and complete
colocalization with fibrillin-1 microfibrils, which were abnormally
thick and wavy, indicating that the truncated LTBP4 alters fibrillin-1
microfibril bundle formation and elongation. TGFB1 (190180) levels were
similar in patient fibroblasts and controls.

CUTIS LAXA, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE, TYPE IC
LTBP4, ARG448TER

In a 23-year-old woman with cutis laxa (ARCL1C; 613177) primarily
localized to the thorax, abdomen, and thighs, Callewaert et al. (2013)
identified compound heterozygosity for a 1342C-T transition in the LTBP4
gene, resulting in an arg448-to-ter (R448X) substitution in the first
8-cys domain, and a 1-bp duplication (4115dupC; 614710.0007), causing a
frameshift predicted to result in a premature termination codon
(tyr1373ilefs*2) in the third 8-cys domain. Additional features in this
patient included mild pulmonary emphysema, diaphragmatic hernia, severe
bladder diverticulae requiring an artificial bladder, rectal prolapse,
joint hypermobility, and mild facial dysmorphism with large ears and a
beaked nose. The patient had an affected sib who died at 2 years of age.
Patient fibroblasts showed greatly reduced expression of mutant LTBP4
compared to controls at both the mRNA and protein levels; double
immunostaining for LTBP4 and fibrillin-1 (134797) showed no
extracellular LTBP4 staining and fibrillin-1 microfibrils appeared
normal. Patient cells released significantly higher levels of TGFB1
(190180) than controls (p = 0.0001).

In a 13-year-old girl with mild cutis laxa associated with emphysema
(ARCL1C; 613177) who died of brain abscesses, Callewaert et al. (2013)
identified homozygosity for a 4129C-T transition in the LTBP4 gene,
resulting in an arg1337-to-ter (R1337X) substitution in the third 8-cys
domain. The patient's emphysema appeared mild on CT, but lung function
tests showed severe obstructive disease with a Tiffeneau index of 41%.
She had bladder diverticulae with secondary hydronephrosis, requiring
ureterostomy. Other features included patent foramen ovale, tricuspid
insufficiency, peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis, pulmonary
hypertension, and dysmorphism consisting of prominent forehead,
blepharochalasis, epicanthal folds, short nose, elongated and marked
philtrum, low-set large ears, webbed neck, and low posterior hairline.

;;PAK- AND PLC-INTERACTING PROTEIN 1; PIP1;;
PAK1-INTERACTING PROTEIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using phospholipase C-beta-3 (PLCB3; 600230) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid
screen, Xia et al. (2001) cloned PIP1 from a heart cDNA library. The
deduced 392-amino acid protein contains 5 WD repeats in its N-terminal
half and has a positively charged C-terminal domain. The WD repeats are
similar to those of G protein beta subunits (see 139130), and PIP1
shares significant homology with yeast PAK (see PAK1; 602590)
regulators. Northern blot analysis detected a major 2.4-kb PIP1
transcript in all tissues examined, with highest expression in brain,
heart, and muscle. A minor 4.1-kb transcript was also detected.

GENE FUNCTION

Xia et al. (2001) determined that PIP1 binds PAK1 in vitro and in vivo.
Mutation analysis indicated that PIP1 interacts specifically with the
N-terminal regulatory domain of PAK1, which contains the NCK
(600508)-binding motif, a dimerization domain, an inhibitory switch
domain, and a kinase inhibitor segment. Transfection of PIP1 in
mammalian cells inhibited CDC42 (116952)-stimulated PAK kinase activity
and PAK-mediated JNK (see 601158) and nuclear factor kappa-B (NFKB; see
164011) signaling pathways. Overexpression of PIP1 in mouse embryonic
fibroblasts resulted in abnormally rounded cell morphology and
reorganized actin stress fibers. Xia et al. (2001) proposed that PIP1
may inhibit PAK signaling by stabilizing PAK1 in the inactive dimeric
conformation.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the PAK1IP1
gene to chromosome 6 (TMAP stSG54559).

173393	TITLE *173393 PLATELET-ACTIVATING FACTOR RECEPTOR; PTAFR
;;PAFR
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

PTAFR shows structural characteristics of the rhodopsin (180380) gene
family and binds platelet-activating factor (PAF). PAF is a phospholipid
(1-0-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine) that has been
implicated as a mediator in diverse pathologic processes, such as
allergy, asthma, septic shock, arterial thrombosis, and inflammatory
processes.

CLONING

By PCR using primers based on the sequence of guinea pig PAF receptor to
amplify guinea pig genomic DNA, followed by screening of a human genomic
library, Seyfried et al. (1992) isolated the human PTAFR gene. They
determined that the PAF receptor appears to be a member of the G
protein-coupled family of receptors and exhibits significant similarity
to many members of this family.

Using either a conserved rhodopsin-type receptor sequence or the
sequence of guinea pig PAF receptor as probe to screen cDNA libraries of
hematopoietic origin, Ye et al. (1991), Nakamura et al. (1991), and Kunz
et al. (1992) cloned the cDNA for human PAF receptor. Human PTAFR shares
about 82% identity with the guinea pig PAF receptor. Kunz et al. (1992)
determined that the deduced 342-amino acid protein contains 7 putative
transmembrane domains interspersed with polar peptide segments,
characteristic of rhodopsin-type G protein-dependent receptors. PTAFR
has 2 N-glycosylation sites, but unlike other rhodopsin family members,
there is no N-glycosylation site in the N-terminal segment. Transfection
of PTAFR into COS-7 cells resulted in expression of the receptor with an
extracellular N terminus.

Nakamura et al. (1991) determined that the calculated molecular mass of
the PTAFR protein is about 39.2 kD. Northern blot analysis detected
abundant expression of an approximately 3.8-kb PTAFR transcript in
leukocytes, with less expression in undifferentiated eosinophilic or
erythroleukemia cell lines. Ye et al. (1991) detected a 4.0-kb PTAFR
transcript in placenta and lung, but not in heart, brain, liver,
skeletal muscle, kidney, or pancreas. Differentiated HL-60 granulocytes
also expressed PTAFR, but undifferentiated cells did not.

GENE FUNCTION

Nakamura et al. (1991) recorded an electrophysiologic response in
injected Xenopus oocytes following PTAFR expression, and observed that
transfected COS-7 cells showed ligand binding with pharmacologic
properties of the PAF receptor. Activation of the PAF receptor yielded
inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate production in both COS-7 cells and oocytes.
Injection of a nonhydrolyzable GTP analog into oocytes inhibited
PAF-induced chloride ion currents, indicating that PAF stimulates
phosphoinositide turnover via G protein(s). The level of PTAFR mRNA
increased in an eosinophilic leukemia cell line treated with
granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (138960), IL5 (147850),
and n-butyrate.

Ye et al. (1991) demonstrated that stably transfected mouse fibroblasts
expressing human PTAFR responded to subnanomolar PAF stimulation with
calcium mobilization, which could be inhibited by a PAF antagonist.
Calcium mobilization was PAF-dose-dependent and appeared to result from
an increase in the intracellular level of free calcium, since addition
of EGTA did not alter the calcium response.

Kunz et al. (1992) found that expression of PTAFR in a myeloid cell line
decreased following differentiation induced with dibutyryl-cAMP. They
demonstrated uptake of PAF by PTAFR-transfected COS-7 cells, and the
uptake was blocked by a PAF receptor antagonist.

Cundell et al. (1995) found that the mechanism of Streptococcus
pneumoniae attachment differed between activated and resting cells, and
that PTAFR is utilized to gain entry into activated cells. PAF and the
pneumococcal cell wall share phosphorylcholine as a determinant of
proinflammatory activity. Attachment of bacterial phosphorylcholine to
PTAFR enhanced adherence, which was coupled to invasion of endothelial,
epithelial, and PTAFR-transfected COS-7 cells. This progression was
arrested in vitro and in vivo by PTAFR-specific antagonists. PAF
interaction with PTAFR resulted in activation of phospholipase C (see
604114), but pneumococcal interaction with PTAFR did not. Cundell et al.
(1995) concluded that the binding of bacterial phosphorylcholine to
PTAFR in the absence of signal transduction subverts receptor
internalization to allow cell invasion.

By transduction of PTAFR into a PTAFR-negative epidermal cell line,
Marques et al. (2002) demonstrated that PTAFR activation stimulates ERK
(601795) and p38 (600289) MAP kinases, but not the JNK (601158) MAP
kinase. PTAFR activation also stimulated ERK-dependent cell
proliferation. ERK activation by PTAFR required the cleavage of
membrane-bound heparin-binding EGF (126150) by matrix metalloproteinases
(see 600754) and the subsequent activation of the EGF receptor (131550).
However, activation of p38 by PTAFR occurred through a distinct pathway.

Lukashova et al. (2001) found that PAF induced rapid tyrosine
phosphorylation of TYK2 (176941) in 2 human monocytic cell lines and in
COS-7 cells transfected with PTAFR and TYK2 cDNAs. TYK2
coimmunoprecipitated and colocalized with PTAFR independent of ligand
binding. Deletion mutation analysis indicated that the N terminus of
TYK2 bound PTAFR. Activation of TYK2 was followed by a time-dependent 2-
to 4-fold increase in the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1
(600555), STAT2 (600556), and STAT3 (102582), and a sustained 2.5-fold
increase in STAT5 (see 601511) tyrosine phosphorylation. STAT1 and STAT3
translocated to the nucleus following PAF stimulation, and their
translocation was dependent on TYK2 in transiently-transfected COS-7
cells. In the presence of TYK2, PAF induced activation of PTAFR
promoter-1 in a reporter assay. TYK2 activation and signaling by PAF was
independent of G proteins.

GENE STRUCTURE

Seyfried et al. (1992) determined that the PTAFR coding sequence
contains no introns.

Chase et al. (1993) found evidence for at least 1 intron in the 5-prime
untranslated region of the PTAFR gene.

MAPPING

By analysis of rodent/human somatic cell hybrids, Seyfried et al. (1992)
concluded that the PTAFR gene is located on human chromosome 1. Chase et
al. (1996) used fluorescence in situ hybridization to localize PTAFR to
1p35-p34.3. By Southern blot analysis, Kunz et al. (1992) determined
that GPR135 is a single-copy gene.

300507	TITLE *300507 H2B HISTONE FAMILY, MEMBER W, TESTIS-SPECIFIC; H2BFWT
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Testis-specific histones, like H2BFWT, are synthesized and accumulate at
specific stages of mammalian spermatogenesis. Their proposed functions
range from facilitation of the replacement of somatic histones by
protamines to epigenetic control of gene transcription (Churikov et al.,
2004).

For background information on histones, histone gene clusters, and the
H2B histone family, see HIST1H2BA (609904).

CLONING

By searching databases using the H2B domain consensus sequence as probe,
followed by RT-PCR of testis RNA, Churikov et al. (2004) cloned H2BFWT.
The deduced 175-amino acid protein shares 43% and 46% identity with the
somatic H2B.1 protein (601831) and the testis/sperm-specific TSH2B
protein, respectively. Highest similarity is in the C-terminal canonical
H2B domains. Database analysis indicated that the H2BFWT gene is
conserved among primates and is apparently absent from rodents. PCR of
several tissues detected H2BFWT expression in testis only.
Immunolocalization detected H2BFWT at the nuclear membrane of sperm
cells. H2BFWT showed even nuclear staining in 10% of transfected Chinese
hamster fibroblasts and colocalized with telomeric sequences in large
nuclear bodies in the other 90%.

GENE FUNCTION

Using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay, Churikov et al. (2004)
found that H2BFWT showed nonspecific interaction with DNA, a
characteristic of core histones. H2BFWT did not show specific affinity
for (TTAGGG)n telomeric sequences.

GENE STRUCTURE

Churikov et al. (2004) determined that the H2BFWT gene contains 3 exons
and spans about 3.5 kb. Exon 3 is noncoding.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Churikov et al. (2004) mapped the H2BFWT
gene to a cluster of 7 H2B family genes on chromosome Xq22.2.

612082	TITLE *612082 CAPICUA, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF; CIC
;;KIAA0306
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing cloned obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1997) obtained a partial CIC clone, which they
designated KIAA0306. The deduced 1,451-amino acid sequence shows weak
homology with the mouse HMG-box transcription factor Sox18 (601618).
RT-PCR analysis revealed ubiquitous CIC expression.

Lee et al. (2002) identified CIC in both human and mouse genomes using
database mining to identify SOX (see 602148)-related genes. The human
cDNA predicted a 1,608-amino acid protein. Human and mouse genes exhibit
92% identity, with 100% identity in the HMG domain. Because the level of
similarity of CIC to other SOX genes is insufficient for inclusion as a
genuine member of the SOX subfamily, CIC represents a new member of a
SOX-related HMG subfamily. RT-PCR of developing mouse central nervous
system showed that Cic is highly expressed in the developing mouse
brain, particularly in the immature granular cells in the cerebellum,
hippocampus, and olfactory bulb.

GENE FUNCTION

Because Drosophila Cic had been shown to mediate c-erbB (EGFR; see
131550) signaling via transcriptional repression, Lee et al. (2005)
studied the expression of human CIC in medulloblastoma, where high
levels of ERBB2 (164870) and ERBB4 (600543) correlate with poor
prognosis. In silico SAGE analysis of human normal and malignant brain
demonstrated that medulloblastoma exhibited the highest level of CIC
expression and that expression was most common in tumors of the central
nervous system in general. RT-PCR and in situ hybridization verified the
expression of CIC in tumor cells, although the level of expression
varied between different medulloblastoma subtypes. In mouse postnatally
developing cerebellum, in silico analysis and in situ hybridization
indicated a strong correlation between Cic expression and the maturation
profile of cerebellar granule cell precursors.

Lam et al. (2006) examined soluble protein complexes from mouse
cerebellum and found that the majority of wildtype and expanded Atxn1
(601556) assembles into large stable complexes containing the
transcriptional repressor Cic. Atxn1 directly bound Cic and modulated
Cic repressor activity in Drosophila and mammalian cells, and its loss
decreased the steady state level of Cic. Interestingly, the S776A
mutation, which abrogates the neurotoxicity of expanded Atxn1,
substantially reduced the association of mutant Atxn1 with Cic in vivo.
Lam et al. (2006) concluded that their data provided insight into the
function of Atxn1 and suggested that the neuropathology of SCA1
(164400), caused by expansion of the ATXN1 polyglutamine tract, depends
on native, not novel, protein interactions. Lam et al. (2006) found that
the majority of CIC associates with ATXN1 in vivo and that ATXN1 binds
CIC through an 8-amino acid sequence conserved across species.

Lim et al. (2008) demonstrated that the expanded polyglutamine tract of
ATXN1 differentially affects the function of the host protein in the
context of different endogenous protein complexes. Polyglutamine
expansion in ATXN1 favors the formation of a particular protein complex
containing RBM17 (606935), contributing to SCA1 neuropathology by means
of a gain-of-function mechanism. Concomitantly, polyglutamine expansion
attenuates the formation and function of another protein complex
containing ATXN1 and capicua, contributing to SCA1 through a partial
loss-of-function mechanism. Lim et al. (2008) concluded that their model
provides mechanistic insight into the molecular pathogenesis of SCA1 as
well as other polyglutamine diseases.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lee et al. (2002) determined that the CIC gene contains 20 exons.

MAPPING

Using a radiation hybrid panel, Nagase et al. (1997) mapped the CIC gene
to chromosome 19. Lee et al. (2002) mapped the human CIC gene to
chromosome 19q13.2.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Bettegowda et al. (2011) performed exonic sequencing of 7
oligodendrogliomas (see 137800). Among other changes, they found that
the CIC gene on chromosome 19q was somatically mutated in 6 cases and
that the FUBP1 (603444) gene on chromosome 1p was somatically mutated in
2 tumors. Examination of 27 additional oligodendrogliomas revealed 12
and 3 more tumors with mutations of CIC and FUBP1, respectively, 58% of
which were predicted to result in truncations of the encoded proteins.
Bettegowda et al. (2011) concluded that their results suggested a
critical role for these genes in the biology and pathology of
oligodendrocytes.

CYTOGENETICS

In 2 cases of Ewing-like sarcomas (see 612219), Kawamura-Saito et al.
(2006) identified the chromosomal translocation t(4;19)(q35;q13). The
breakpoint at chromosome 19q13 was within exon 20 of the CIC gene, and
the breakpoint at chromosome 4q35 was within the DUX4 (606009) coding
region in the D4Z4 repeat region. The translocation resulted in a
CIC-DUX4 fusion transcript that was translated into a chimeric protein
containing most of the CIC sequence, including the HMG box and TLE (see
600189)-binding sites, fused in frame to the C terminus of DUX4. The
chimeric protein did not contain the N-terminal DNA-binding homeodomains
of DUX4. No reciprocal DUX4-CIC transcripts were observed. The CIC-DUX4
transcript induced anchorage-independent growth when transfected into
mouse fibroblasts. Although CIC is a transcriptional repressor, the
CIC-DUX4 transcript enhanced transcription of a reporter gene when
transfected into HeLa cells. Microarray analysis revealed altered gene
expression following transfection of CIC-DUX4 into a human osteosarcoma
cell line, including significantly upregulated expression of ERM (ETV5;
601600) and ETV1 (600541). Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis and
electrophoretic mobility shift assays confirmed binding of the chimeric
protein to the ERM and ETV1 promoters.

ANIMAL MODEL

Studies of the pathogenesis of SCA1 supported a model in which the
expanded glutamine tract in the ATXN1 gene causes toxicity by modulating
the normal activities of that gene. To explore native interactions that
modify the toxicity of ATXN1, Bowman et al. (2007) generated a targeted
duplication of the mouse Ataxn1l gene (614301), a highly conserved
paralog of Atxn1, and tested the role of this protein in SCA1 pathology.
Using a knockin mouse model of SCA1 that recapitulates the selective
neurodegeneration seen in affected individuals, Bowman et al. (2007)
found that elevated Atxn1l levels suppress neuropathology by displacing
mutant Atxn1 from its native complex with Capicua. The results provided
genetic evidence that the selective neuropathology of SCA1 arises from
modulation of a core functional activity of ATXN1, and underscored the
importance of studying the paralogs of genes mutated in
neurodegenerative diseases to gain insight into mechanisms of
pathogenesis.

604083	TITLE *604083 ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 142; ZNF142
DESCRIPTION Transcriptional regulatory proteins containing tandemly repeated zinc
finger domains are thought to be involved in both normal and abnormal
cellular proliferation and differentiation. One abundant class of such
transcriptional regulators resembles the Drosophila Kruppel segmentation
gene product due to the presence of repeated Cys2-His2 (C2H2) zinc
finger domains that are connected by conserved sequences, called H/C
links. See ZNF91 (603971) for general information on zinc finger
proteins.

By screening a human insulinoma cDNA library with a degenerate
oligonucleotide corresponding to the H/C linker sequence, Tommerup et
al. (1993) isolated cDNAs potentially encoding zinc finger proteins.
Tommerup and Vissing (1995) performed sequence analysis on a number of
these cDNAs and identified several novel zinc finger protein genes,
including ZNF142. The ZNF142 cDNA predicts a protein belonging to the
Kruppel family of zinc finger proteins.

By sequencing random cDNAs corresponding to relatively long transcripts,
Nagase et al. (1996) identified a cDNA encoding ZNF142, which they
called KIAA0236. The deduced ZNF142 protein has 1,687 amino acids.
Northern blot analysis detected ZNF142 expression in all 16 human
tissues examined.

Nagase et al. (1996) mapped the ZNF142 gene to chromosome 2 using a
radiation hybrid mapping panel. By FISH, Tommerup and Vissing (1995)
mapped the ZNF142 gene to 2q34-q35.

606845	TITLE *606845 GOLGI-ASSOCIATED PDZ AND COILED-COIL DOMAINS-CONTAINING PROTEIN; GOPC
;;PDZ PROTEIN INTERACTING SPECIFICALLY WITH TC10; PIST;;
FUSED IN GLIOBLASTOMA; FIG;;
CFTR-ASSOCIATED LIGAND; CAL
FIG/ROS1 FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

PIST is a PDZ domain-containing Golgi protein. PDZ domains contain
approximately 90 amino acids and bind the extreme C terminus of proteins
in a sequence-specific manner.

CLONING

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a day-9 mouse embryo cDNA library with
a TC10 (605857) gain-of-function mutant as bait, followed by EST
database searching and RACE, Neudauer et al. (2001) obtained cDNAs
encoding mouse and human PIST. The deduced 454-amino acid human protein,
which is approximately 92% identical to the mouse protein, contains 2
putative coiled-coil domains, with a potential leucine zipper in the
second domain, followed by a novel region conserved in mouse and worm,
and a PDZ domain. Northern blot analysis revealed ubiquitous expression
of a 4.4-kb transcript, with highest expression in brain and heart.

By EST database searching with a PDZ domain of rat Psd95 (602887) as the
probe, followed by PCR and probing of a myeloid leukemia cDNA library,
Charest et al. (2001) obtained a cDNA encoding FIG. In addition to the
protein structures identified by Neudauer et al. (2001), the authors
reported multiple phosphorylation sites in FIG. They found that the FIG
PDZ domains cluster with those of the syntrophin family (e.g., SNTA1,
601017). Western blot analysis showed expression of a 59-kD protein in
all mouse tissues examined. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated
that perinuclear, brefeldin A-sensitive Golgi localization occurs
through the second, or C-terminal, coiled-coil domain (CCD) and is
independent of the leucine zipper.

Independently, Yao et al. (2001) also cloned and characterized PIST,
which they termed GOPC.

GENE FUNCTION

Binding and mutation analyses by Neudauer et al. (2001) indicated a
leucine zipper-dependent interaction of PIST with GTP-bound TC10 and
with PIST itself, but not with other Rho GTPases.

Binding analysis and immunofluorescence microscopy by Yao et al. (2001)
indicated that the PDZ domain of GOPC interacts with the C-terminal
domain of frizzled-5 (FZD5; 601723) or FZD8 (606146) in the Golgi
apparatus before the FZD proteins translocate by the secretory pathway
to the plasma membrane.

Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence microscopy by Charest et
al. (2001) showed that FIG interacts through its C-terminal CCD with
syntaxin-6 (STX6; 603944) in the Golgi apparatus. They proposed that FIG
may be involved in membrane vesicle trafficking.

Coimmunoprecipitation analysis and immunofluorescence microscopy by
Cheng et al. (2002) showed that PIST, which they called CAL, interacts
with the C terminus of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance
regulator (CFTR; 602421) in the Golgi. Functional analysis indicated
that the CAL-CFTR interaction results in a reduction of the CFTR
chloride current by a selective inhibition of cell surface CFTR
expression; this could be reversed by competition from NHERF (604990).

Cheng et al. (2010) showed that STX6 was involved in CAL-mediated
downregulation of CFTR. While CAL bound the C terminus of CFTR, STX6
independently bound the N terminus of CFTR. Overexpression of STX6
reduced cell surface expression of CFTR and caused its instability, but
not in the absence of CAL and not in the presence of a lysosome
inhibitor. STX6 and CAL had no effect on the stability of CFTR with the
cystic fibrosis (219700)-associated delta-F508 mutation (602421.0001),
which is retained in the ER and undergoes ER-associated degradation.
Cheng et al. (2010) concluded that STX6 and CAL function in the
trans-Golgi network and direct trafficking of CFTR to the lysosome.

Using yeast 2-hybrid system experiments, Yue et al. (2002) determined
that an isoform of PIST in mice, which they called nPist, interacts with
both Grid2 (602368) and Becn1 (604378). Coimmunoprecipitation and
colocalization experiments demonstrated that the specific interaction of
Grid2 and nPist requires the C terminus of Grid2 and the nPist PDZ
domain. GST pull-down assays, coimmunoprecipitation assays, and
colocalization experiments confirmed the interaction between nPist and
Becn1. In transfected cells, nPist and Becn1 acted synergistically to
induce autophagy. Yue et al. (2002) proposed that nPist, Grid2, and
Becn1 form a complex in cerebellar Purkinje cells in vivo and suggested
that disruption of this complex in Grid2 mutant lurcher mice results in
activation of autophagy in lurcher Purkinje cells.

- FIG/ROS Fusion Protein

Charest et al. (2003) reported the analysis of an interstitial deletion
of 240 kb on 6q21 that fused the FIG gene to the receptor protein
tyrosine kinase (RTK) ROS1 (165020) in glioblastoma cell lines. The
resulting FIG/ROS fusion protein is a constitutively activated tyrosine
kinase. This was the first example of a genomic event that leads to the
formation of an RTK fusion protein in an astrocytoma.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping consortium mapped the PIST
gene to chromosome 6 (TMAP WI-12920).

ANIMAL MODEL

Yao et al. (2002) showed that GOPC is predominantly localized at the
trans-Golgi region in round spermatids, and that male mice in which GOPC
has been disrupted are infertile with globozoospermia (102530). The
primary defect was the fragmentation of acrosomes in early round
spermatids, and abnormal vesicles that failed to fuse to developing
acrosomes were apparent. In later stages, nuclear malformation and an
abnormal arrangement of mitochondria, which are also characteristic
features of human globozoospermia, were observed. Intracytoplasmic sperm
injection of such malformed sperm into oocytes resulted in cleavage into
blastocysts only when injected oocytes were activated. The authors
concluded that GOPC provides important clues to understanding the
mechanisms underlying spermatogenesis, and the GOPC-deficient mouse may
be a unique and valuable model for human globozoospermia.

608735	TITLE *608735 SOLUTE CARRIER FAMILY 39 (ZINC TRANSPORTER), MEMBER 13; SLC39A13
;;ZIP13;;
LZT-HS9
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Zinc is an essential cofactor for hundreds of enzymes. It is involved in
protein, nucleic acid, carbohydrate, and lipid metabolism, as well as in
the control of gene transcription, growth, development, and
differentiation. SLC39A13 belongs to a subfamily of proteins that show
structural characteristics of zinc transporters (Taylor and Nicholson,
2003).

CLONING

By searching databases for sequences similar to a unique motif within
LIV1 (SLC39A6; 608731), Taylor and Nicholson (2003) identified SLC39A13,
which they designated LZT-Hs9. The deduced 364-amino acid protein
contains a long N terminus, followed by 8 putative transmembrane domains
and a short C terminus. It also has a high histidine content, including
a motif similar to the catalytic zinc-binding site of matrix
metalloproteases.

Using in situ hybridization, Fukada et al. (2008) found that Slc39a13
was highly expressed in mouse bone and eye. Slc39a13 was expressed in
osteoblasts of tibia and alveolar bone, in proliferative zone of growth
plate, in odontoblasts of the forming dentin crown in molar teeth, and
in fibroblasts of the reticular layer of skin. Immunohistochemical
analysis showed that Slc39a13 localized in the perinuclear region of
osteoblasts, chondrocytes, pulpal cells, and fibroblasts and was mainly
associated with the Golgi apparatus. Fukada et al. (2008) concluded that
SLC39A13 is expressed in cells essential for connective tissue
development.

Bin et al. (2011) noted that SLC39A13, which they called ZIP13, contains
an N-terminal pro-ala-leu (PAL) zinc-dependent processing site and a
his-glu-x-x-his (HExxH) zinc-binding motif, both of which are found in
the LZT family of zinc transporters. In ZIP13, the HExxH motif is
located within transmembrane domain 5. ZIP13 also has a putative
zinc-binding HN motif in transmembrane domain 4. Bin et al. (2011)
identified a a cleavable endoplasmic reticulum (ER) signal peptide
N-terminal to the PAL motif in ZIP13. Immunocytochemical analysis
revealed that ZIP13 colocalized with a Golgi marker and partially with
an ER marker. Protease accessibility experiments revealed that both the
N and C termini of ZIP13 were luminal.

MAPPING

Hartz (2004) mapped the SLC39A13 gene to chromosome 11p11.2 based on an
alignment of the SLC39A13 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK098651) with the
genomic sequence.

GENE FUNCTION

Using reducing and nonreducing SDS-PAGE, immunoprecipitation analysis,
and crosslinking experiments, Bin et al. (2011) showed that ZIP13 formed
homodimers. Overexpression of ZIP13 in HEK293 cells elevated
intracellular zinc content and caused upregulation of the gene encoding
metallothionein-1A (MT1A; 156350).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 6 affected members of 2 consanguineous families with a
spondylocheirodysplastic form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (612350), Giunta
et al. (2008) identified homozygosity for a 9-bp in-frame deletion in
exon 4 of the SLC39A13 gene (608735.0001).

Fukada et al. (2008) identified a homozygous loss-of-function mutation
in the SLC39A13 gene (G74D; 608735.0002) in 2 sibs with an Ehlers-Danlos
syndrome-like phenotype similar to that reported by Giunta et al.
(2008).

ANIMAL MODEL

Fukada et al. (2008) found that Slc39a13 -/- mice were growth retarded
and developed progressive kyphosis after 3 or 4 weeks of age. They
showed changes in bone, teeth, and connective tissue reminiscent of
human Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, with defects in the maturation of
osteoblasts, chondrocytes, odontoblasts, and fibroblasts. The
corresponding tissues and cells showed impaired bone morphogenic protein
(BMP; see 112264) and TGF-beta (TGFB1; 190180) signaling.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
SPONDYLOCHEIRODYSPLASIA, EHLERS-DANLOS SYNDROME-LIKE
SLC39A13, 9-BP DEL, NT483

In 6 affected members of 2 consanguineous families with a
spondylocheirodysplastic form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (612350), Giunta
et al. (2008) identified homozygosity for a 9-bp in-frame deletion in
exon 4 of the SLC39A13 gene (483_491del9), resulting in the deletion of
3 amino acids (F162_164del) within the highly conserved transmembrane
domain III. All of the parents and several sibs were heterozygous for
the mutation, which was not found in 182 control individuals.

.0002
SPONDYLOCHEIRODYSPLASIA, EHLERS-DANLOS SYNDROME-LIKE
SLC39A13, GLY74ASP

In 2 sibs with the spondylocheirodysplastic form of Ehlers-Danlos
syndrome (612350), Fukada et al. (2008) identified a homozygous G-to-A
transition at nucleotide 221 in the SLC39A13 cDNA, resulting in a
nonconservative gly74-to-asp (G74D) substitution. G74 is located in the
second transmembrane domain of SLC39A13 and is conserved in vertebrates
from fish to humans.

608679	TITLE *608679 TP53-REGULATING KINASE; TP53RK
;;p53-RELATED PROTEIN KINASE; PRPK
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By cDNA subtraction to identify transcripts expressed by
cytolytic-competent cytotoxic T cells but not cytolytic-inactive
cytotoxic T cells, followed by PCR of a spleen cDNA library, Abe et al.
(2001) cloned TP53RK, which they designated PRPK. The deduced 253-amino
acid has a nuclear localization signal and characteristics of a protein
kinase, but it lacks some typical protein kinase motifs. PRPK shares 83%
amino acid identity with the 244-amino acid mouse protein, with most
differences in 9 N-terminal amino acids. Northern blot analysis detected
an abundant transcript of about 1.0 kb in testis. Lower expression was
found in heart, kidney, and spleen, and no expression was found in the
other tissues examined. RT-PCR detected expression in human adherent
cancer cell lines of epithelial origin, but not in B-cell lymphoid tumor
cell lines. Western blot analysis detected endogenous PRPK in embryonic
kidney cells, activated T cells, and a T-cell lymphoma cell line. The
apparent molecular mass was 31 kD. Epitope-tagged PRPK localized to the
nucleus of transfected COS-7 cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Abe et al. (2001) found that recombinant PRPK phosphorylated casein (see
115460) in the presence of Mg(2+), but not Mn(2+). PRPK did not show
autophosphorylation activity. PRPK-transfected COS-7 cells showed
significant upregulation of p53 (191170) activity, but there was no
upregulation of several other transcription factors. PRPK bound p53 in
vitro and phosphorylated p53 on ser15 in vitro and in vivo.

By coimmunoprecipitation and in vitro binding assays, Miyoshi et al.
(2003) demonstrated that PRPK interacts with CGI-121 (608680).
Coprecipitation of p53 with PRPK was inhibited by adding recombinant
CGI-121 in vitro, suggesting that CGI-121 may act as an inhibitor of the
PRPK-p53 interaction.

MAPPING

By FISH, radiation hybrid analysis, and genomic sequence analysis, Abe
et al. (2001) mapped the TP53RK gene to chromosome 20q13.2.

;;KERATIN, HAIR, ACIDIC, 2; KRTHA2;;
KERATIN, HARD, TYPE I, 2; HA2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

See KRTHA1 (601077) for general information on hair keratins.

CLONING

By screening a human scalp cDNA library with a mouse Ha2 cDNA, Rogers et
al. (1995) cloned a cDNA encoding KRTHA2, or HA2. The predicted protein
has 405 amino acids, including a 41-amino acid C terminus. The amino
acid sequences of the human and mouse HA2 proteins are 81% identical.
Northern blot analysis detected HA2 transcripts in human scalp but not
unhaired breast epidermis.

Rogers et al. (1998) reported that the deduced KRTHA2 protein has 448
amino acids. By RT-PCR, Rogers et al. (1998) showed that KRTHA2 is
expressed in the human hair follicle. See Langbein et al. (1999) for
further details on the expression pattern of the KRTHA2 gene in the hair
follicle.

Winter et al. (1994) found that expression of mouse Ha2 mRNA occurs
early in hair morphogenesis and is strictly limited to the cuticle of
the hair shaft.

GENE STRUCTURE

Rogers et al. (1996) isolated the HA2 genomic sequence. The HA2 gene and
its flanking sequences span over 14 kb. The gene contains 7 exons; the 6
conserved introns are located in the region encoding the alpha-helical
domain. The 5-prime flanking sequence contains a LEF1 (153245)-binding
site, which is present in several hair follicle-associated genes. Zhou
et al. (1995) showed that LEF1 is important for hair patterning and
morphogenesis.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Rogers et al. (1995) mapped the
HA2 gene to 17q12-q21. Rogers et al. (1996) found that the HA5 (KRTHA5;
602764) gene is located 8 kb upstream of the HA2 gene. Rogers et al.
(1998) isolated and characterized 2 overlapping human PAC clones that
cover 190 kb on 17q12-q21 and contain 9 type I hair keratin genes, 1
transcribed hair keratin pseudogene, and 1 orphan exon. The order of the
genes is 5-prime--KRTHA6 (604540)--KRTHA5--KRTHA2--orphan exon--KRTHA8
(604542)--KRTHA7 (604541)--pseudogene--KRTHA1--KRTHA4 (602763)--KRTHA3B
(602762)--KRTHA3A (602761)--3-prime. The hair keratin genes range in
size from 4.2 to 7.5 kb, and the genes are separated from each other by
5.5 to 18.4 kb; all are located within about 140 kb. Each gene is
transcribed from the 5-prime to 3-prime direction. Based on sequence
homologies, the genes can be grouped into 3 subclusters of tandemly
arranged genes. One subcluster, group A, consists of KRTHA1, KRTHA3A,
KRTHA3B, and KRTHA4, which share 89% overall amino acid identity. A
second subcluster, group B, contains KRTHA7 and KRTHA8, as well as the
hair keratin pseudogene, which the authors called HAA. The functional
hair keratins and hypothetical HAA hair keratin share approximately 81%
overall amino acid identity. The third subcluster, group C, consists of
the structurally less related hair keratins KRTHA2, KRTHA5, and KRTHA6,
which share about 70% amino acid identity.

189968	TITLE *189968 GENERAL TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR IIF, POLYPEPTIDE 1, 74-KD; GTF2F1
;;TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR IIF, ALPHA SUBUNIT;;
TFIIF ALPHA;;
TF2F1;;
RAP74
DESCRIPTION At least 6 chromatographically resolvable general transcription factors
may participate in accurate initiation by RNA polymerase II in HeLa
cell-derived systems. TFIIF can bind directly to RNA polymerase II in
solution and decrease the affinity of RNA polymerase II for nonspecific
DNA. TFIIF is known to act at an intermediate stage in initiation
complex formation. It acts after TFIID (313650) firmly associates with
DNA, but coincidentally with or immediately after RNA polymerase II
binding to DNA, and before the recruitment of factor TFIIE (189962,
189964). The small subunit (RAP30; 189969) of TFIIF was cloned by Sopta
et al. (1989) and shown to have some amino acid sequence homology to
bacterial sigma factors. Aso et al. (1992) partially sequenced the RAP74
protein from purified HeLa cells, cloned its cDNA, and showed that its
translation product can interact with RAP30 in vitro as well as in vivo.
The cDNA predicted an amino acid sequence that lacks obvious DNA or RNA
helicase motifs. Finkelstein et al. (1992) likewise isolated a cDNA
encoding RAP74 and showed that both RAP30 and RAP74 produced in
Escherichia coli could be used in place of natural human RAP30/74 to
direct accurate transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II in vitro.

By in situ hybridization, Aso et al. (1993) mapped the GTF2F1 gene to
19p13.3.

Joliot et al. (1995) demonstrated that interaction with the RAP74
subunit of TFIIF is necessary for transcriptional activation by serum
response factor (600246).

148060	TITLE *148060 KERATIN 8; KRT8
;;K8;;
CYTOKERATIN 8
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Keratin 8 is a type II keratin (Moll et al., 1982). Endo A is the mouse
equivalent. Endo B, which is the equivalent of human keratin 18
(148070), a type I keratin, is coexpressed with Endo A; the 2 appear to
be the first intermediate filament (IF) proteins expressed during murine
development (Jackson et al., 1980). Yamamoto et al. (1990) studied a
full-length cDNA for cytokeratin 8 from placenta. They determined the
distribution of cytokeratin 8 mRNA in various fetal tissues and in
placentae of different gestational ages.

Krauss and Franke (1990) cloned cytokeratin 8 from a genomic library.
The 485-amino acid protein deduced from the exon sequences has a
calculated molecular mass of about 53.5 kD. CK8 shows strong homology
with the corresponding bovine, mouse, and Xenopus proteins. The human
and mouse CK8 share about 82% identity in the N-terminal head domain,
95% identity in the alpha helical rod domain, and 67.5% identity in the
C-terminal tail.

GENE FUNCTION

He et al. (2002) presented evidence that soluble depolymerized K8
subunits were phosphorylated on ser73 by c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK1;
601158) upon stimulation of the proapoptotic cytokine receptor Fas
(134637) in colon carcinoma cells. K8 was also phosphorylated following
exposure to ultraviolet light. Coimmunoprecipitation studies indicated
that JNK interacted directly with K8, and K8 was able to sequester a
substantial amount of the 54-kD isoform of JNK. The association of JNK
with K8 correlated with the decreased ability of JNK to phosphorylate
endogenous c-Jun (see 165160). He et al. (2002) hypothesized that K8
phosphorylation could regulate JNK signaling and/or keratin dynamics. Ku
et al. (2002) reported the phosphorylation of K8 ser73 by p38
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK14; 600289). p38 MAPK associated
with K8/K18 complexes in transfected baby hamster kidney cells,
phosphorylated K8 on ser73, and bound specifically to K8 in vitro. Ku et
al. (2002) noted that the leu160-to-pro mutation in K1 (139350.0002)
leads to epidermolytic hyperkeratosis (113800). The comparable mutation
in K8 resulted in hyperphosphorylation of K8 due to neophosphorylation
of ser70 in addition to phosphorylation of ser73, and keratin filament
collapse in the presence of okadaic acid, a phosphatase inhibitor.

GENE STRUCTURE

Krauss and Franke (1990) determined that the CK8 gene contains 8 exons
instead of 9 as is found in all other type II cytokeratins due to lack
of intron 5, and the gene spans over 8.8 kb. The 5-prime flanking region
contains a TATA box, 1 SP1 (189906) motif, and an Alu-like sequence in
an orientation opposite that of the CK8 gene. Intron 1 is long (about
2.5 kb) and contains 3 SP1 sites, 1 AP1 (see 165160) site, and another
Alu element in the same orientation as CK8.

MAPPING

Keratins 8 and 18 of simple epithelia differ from the keratins of
stratified epithelia in tissue expression and regulation. Using PCR to
study DNAs from somatic cell hybrids, Waseem et al. (1990) located a
single active gene for keratin 8 on chromosome 12. This chromosome
contains several genes for type II keratins and also the gene for
keratin 18, the type I keratin that is coexpressed with keratin 8. This
location of both members of a keratin pair on a single chromosome is
unique among keratin genes; it is consistent with the hypothesis that
keratins 8 and 18 may be closer to an ancestral gene than the keratins
of more highly differentiated epithelia.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

About 10% of patients who undergo liver transplantation have cryptogenic
liver disease. In animal models, the absence of heteropolymeric keratins
8 and 18 or the presence of mutant keratins in hepatocytes causes or
promotes liver disease. Ku et al. (1997) demonstrated a germline
mutation in keratin 18 (148070.0001) in 1 of 28 patients with
cryptogenic cirrhosis (see 215600). Of 55 patients with cryptogenic
liver disease screened by Ku et al. (2001), 5 unrelated patients had
mutations in the keratin 8 gene that appeared to have predisposed them
to the disease. Three patients had a gly61-to-cys mutation at a highly
conserved glycine (148060.0001), and the other 2 had a tyr53-to-his
mutation (148060.0002). These mutations were not detected in patients
with other forms of liver disease or in randomly selected patients. In
transfected cells, the gly61-to-cys mutation limited keratin filament
reorganization when the cells were exposed to oxidative stress. In
contrast, the tyr53-to-his mutation destabilized keratin filaments when
transfected cells were exposed to heat or okadaic acid stress.

Following up on the observation that KRT8 and KRT18 mutations are found
in patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis, Ku et al. (2003) investigated
the role of keratin mutations in noncryptogenic cirrhosis and the
incidence of keratin mutations in the general population. The results
suggested that K8 and K18 are likely susceptibility genes for developing
both cryptogenic and noncryptogenic forms of liver disease. They studied
314 liver explants of patients who primarily had noncryptogenic
cirrhosis and compared the results with 349 blood bank volunteers. Seven
unique K8/K18 mutations were found in 11 independent patients with
biliary atresia, hepatitis B/C, alcoholism, primary biliary cirrhosis,
and fulminant hepatitis. Seven of the 11 patients had mutations
previously described in patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis: gly61 to
cys (148060.0001), tyr53 to his (148060.0002), and his127 to leu
(148070.0001). Of the 349 blood bank control samples, only 1 contained
the tyr53-to-his mutation and 1 the gly61-to-cys mutation. Livers with
keratin mutations had cytoplasmic filamentous deposits that were less
frequent in livers without the mutations (P = 0.03).

ANIMAL MODEL

Casanova et al. (1999) generated mice expressing the human KRT8 gene,
leading to a moderate increase in the content of keratin in simple
epithelia. These mice displayed progressive exocrine pancreas
alterations, including dysplasia and loss of acinar architecture,
redifferentiation of acinar to ductal cells, inflammation, fibrosis, and
substitution of exocrine by adipose tissue, as well as increased cell
proliferation and apoptosis. The phenotype was very similar to that
reported for transgenic mice expressing a dominant-negative mutant
TGF-beta type II receptor (TGFBR2; 190182). Casanova et al. (1999)
showed that these Tgfbr2 mutant mice also had elevated KRT8/KRT18
levels. The results indicated that simple epithelial keratins play a
relevant role in the regulation of exocrine pancreas homeostasis and
supported the idea that disruption of mechanisms that normally regulate
keratin expression in vivo could be related to inflammatory and
neoplastic pancreatic disorders.

Jaquemar et al. (2003) determined that the lethality seen in genetically
sensitive K8-null mouse embryos is due to disruption of the trophoblast
giant cell layer that normally forms a barrier between the maternal and
embryonic compartments. Massive hemorrhages of maternal blood were found
between the decidua capsularis and the parietal yolk sac. Maternal tumor
necrosis factor (TNF; 191160) and TNF receptor (see 191190) contributed
to the lethality.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Zinc finger proteins (ZNFs), which bind nucleic acids, perform many key
functions, the most important of which is regulating transcription. See
ZNF91 (603971) for general information on ZNFs.

CLONING

Becker et al. (1997) reported the cloning of a C2H2-type, or
Kruppel-related (see 602187), zinc finger protein from a human
hippocampus cDNA library. The partial cDNA, designated C2H2-150, encodes
a predicted 356-amino acid protein, with 4 C-terminal C2H2 zinc finger
motifs and an N-terminal Kruppel-associated box (KRAB).

MAPPING

By PCR of somatic cell hybrids, Becker et al. (1997) mapped the gene
encoding C2H2-150 to 7q36.1.

300889	TITLE *300889 ZINC FINGER CCCH DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 12B; ZC3H12B
;;MCP1-INDUCED PROTEIN 2; MCPIP2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ZC3H12B is a CCCH-type zinc finger protein, like TTP (ZFP36; 190700),
ZAP (ZC3HAV1; 607312), and ROQUIN (RC3H1; 609424), whereas most
mammalian zinc finger proteins are CCHH- or CCCC-type proteins. Liang et
al. (2008) found that ZC3H12B, also known as MCPIP2, and other MCPIP
proteins, MCPIP1 (ZC3H12A; 610562), MCPIP3 (ZC3H12C; 615001), and MCPIP4
(ZC3H12D; 611106), regulate macrophage activation.

CLONING

By database searching for genes similar to MCPIP1, Liang et al. (2008)
identified MCPIP2, a 772-amino acid protein containing a single central
CCCH-type zinc finger and a C-terminal RASGEF domain. Unlike other MCPIP
family members, Mcpip2 was not detectable by Northern blot analysis in
mouse macrophages treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or Ifng
(147570).

MAPPING

603428	TITLE *603428 ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 207; ZNF207
DESCRIPTION Pahl et al. (1998) isolated a human vascular smooth muscle cell cDNA
encoding a protein that they designated ZNF207. The predicted 478-amino
acid protein is composed of nearly 20% proline residues and contains a
potential nuclear localization signal at the N-terminus and 2 C2H2 zinc
finger motifs. Northern blot analysis revealed that ZNF207 is expressed
ubiquitously.

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Pahl et al. (1998) mapped the
ZNF207 gene to 6p21.3. Rasooly (1999) noted that the ZNF207 sequence is
contained within a cloned region from chromosome 17 (GENBANK AC005899).

;;POLY(A)-BINDING PROTEIN-INTERACTING PROTEIN 1;;
PABP-INTERACTING PROTEIN 1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

In initiation of translation in eukaryotes, binding of the small
ribosomal subunit to mRNA requires recognition of the 5-prime cap
structure by the cap-binding complex eIF4F. eIF4F consists of eIF4E
(133440), eIF4A (see 602641), and eIF4G (see 600495). Translation
initiation is further regulated by the mRNA 3-prime poly(A) tail and the
poly(A)-binding protein (PABC1; 604679). PAIP1 interacts with PABC1 and
some eIF4 complexes.

CLONING

By Far Western blot analysis of HeLa cell extracts and a placenta cDNA
library using a PABC1 probe, Craig et al. (1998) identified a cDNA
encoding PAIP1 (PABC1-interacting protein-1). Sequence analysis of the
deduced 480-amino acid PAIP1 protein predicted that it shares 39% amino
acid similarity with the central portion of eIF4G, which contains an
eIF4A-binding region. PAIP1 also contains a proline-rich N terminus.
SDS-PAGE analysis determined that PAIP1 is expressed as a 70-kD protein.

GENE FUNCTION

Binding analysis by Craig et al. (1998) showed that PAIP1 binds strongly
to poly(A) only in the presence of PABC1. Immunoprecipitation and
Western blot analysis demonstrated that in HeLa extracts, the C terminus
of PAIP1 interacts with PABC1, and PAIP1 interacts with eIF4A but not
eIF4G complexes.

AU-rich elements and protein-coding determinants direct rapid removal of
poly(A) tails as a necessary first step in mRNA decay. Grosset et al.
(2000) determined that 5 proteins form a multiprotein complex associated
with the major protein-coding-region determinant of instability (mCRD)
of the FOS gene (164810): PABP, HNRNPD (601324), PAIP1, NSAP1, and UNR
(191510). Overexpression of these proteins stabilized mCRD-containing
mRNA by impeding deadenylation.
