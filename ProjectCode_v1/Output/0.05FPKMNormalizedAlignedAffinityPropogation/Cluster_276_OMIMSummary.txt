313475	TITLE *313475 SYNAPTOPHYSIN; SYP
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Synaptophysin is an integral membrane protein that regulates synaptic
vesicle endocytosis. It is the most abundant synaptic vesicle protein by
mass, accounting for about 10% of total vesicle protein (Kwon and
Chapman, 2011).

CLONING

Sudhof et al. (1987) presented the nucleotide and derived amino acid
sequences of human and rat synaptophysin. The deduced human and rat
proteins contain 296 and 307 amino acids, respectively, and both contain
4 transmembrane domains.

Kwon and Chapman (2011) stated that SYP has a short N-terminal segment,
followed by 4 transmembrane domains and a long C-terminal tail. Both N-
and C-terminal tails are located on the cytoplasmic surface of synaptic
vesicles, and the C-terminal tail is phosphorylated. The 2
intravesicular loops of SYP contain disulfide bonds, and the first loop
has an N-glycosylation site.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ozcelik et al. (1990) concluded that the SYP gene has 7 exons
distributed over about 20 kb.

MAPPING

By linkage analysis performed using CEPH families, Ozcelik et al. (1990)
mapped the SYP locus to Xp11.23-p11.22. Regionalization of the gene on
the X chromosome was also done with hamster/human hybrid cells in which
various portions of the human X chromosome were present. Using a RFLP of
SYP, Ozcelik et al. (1990) concluded that SYP lies between TIMP and
DXS14. Ozcelik et al. (1990) mapped the Syp gene to the X chromosome in
the mouse by the study of somatic hybrid cells between mouse and hamster
or rat, with regionalization by the study of hybrid cells containing
rearranged mouse X chromosomes.

Cremin et al. (1993) found that SYP and the TFE3 gene (314310) are
closely linked to the gene for Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (301000).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Tarpey et al. (2009) sequenced the coding exons of the X chromosome in
208 families with X-linked mental retardation. They identified 4
independent mutations in the SYP gene that segregated precisely with the
phenotype (MRX96; 300802) in affected family members and were not
detected in any unaffected family members. In addition to X-linked
mental retardation, some affected family members had epilepsy.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using gene targeting, McMahon et al. (1996) disrupted the murine Syp
gene. Mutant mice were viable and fertile with no detectable changes in
brain. The authors concluded that Syp, one of the major synaptic vesicle
membrane proteins, is not essential for synaptic transmission. They
hypothesized that the function of Syp is either redundant or that it has
a more subtle function not apparent in the assays used.

Janz et al. (1999) generated mice lacking Syngr1 (603925) and bred them
to the Syp knockout generated by McMahon et al. (1996) to create
double-knockout mice deficient in both Syp and Syngr1. Short- and
long-term synaptic plasticity was severely reduced in the Syngr1/Syp
double-knockout mice.

Using optical imaging and electrophysiologic experiments with cultured
wildtype and Syp -/- mouse hippocampal neurons, Kwon and Chapman (2011)
found that Syp was required for efficient endocytosis of synaptic
vesicles. The defect in Syp -/- neurons was most evident following rapid
and sustained stimulation. Voltage clamp experiments with Syp -/-
neurons showed pronounced synaptic depression during sustained activity
and slower recovery of the recycling vesicle pool following depletion.
Neurotransmitter release probability, postsynaptic responses, and
short-term synaptic plasticity appeared normal in Syp -/- neurons.
Expression of C-terminally truncated Syp in Syp -/- neurons rescued
endocytosis that occurred during the recovery period following activity,
but not endocytosis that occurred during activity. Kwon and Chapman
(2011) concluded that Syp has 2 structural elements that regulate
vesicle retrieval during and after stimulation.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MENTAL RETARDATION, X-LINKED 96
SYP, 1-BP INS, 274A

In a family segregating X-linked mental retardation (MRX96; 300802),
Tarpey et al. (2009) identified a 1-basepair insertion at nucleotide 274
of the SYP gene, resulting in frameshift and premature termination
(T92fsX45). This mutation was not found in 272 control chromosomes and
was not found in unaffected family members.

In a 3-generation pedigree segregating X-linked mental retardation
(300802), Tarpey et al. (2009) identified a 2-bp substitution in the SYP
gene resulting in premature protein termination (177_178CA-GT,
N59_K60-KX).

In a family segregating X-linked mental retardation (300802), Tarpey et
al. (2009) identified a 4-bp deletion in the SYP gene beginning at
nucleotide 829, resulting in frameshift and premature termination of the
protein (D277fsX59).

.0004
MENTAL RETARDATION, X-LINKED 96

In a large 4-generation pedigree segregating X-linked mental retardation
(300802), Tarpey et al. (2009) identified a G-to-C transversion at
nucleotide 649 of the SYP gene, resulting in a gly-to-arg substitution
at codon 217 (G217R). The mutation segregated with the phenotype and was
not detected in any unaffected male family members. In addition to
X-linked mental retardation, some affected individuals manifested
epilepsy.

611435	TITLE *611435 DOCKING PROTEIN 3; DOK3
;;DOK-LIKE PROTEIN; DOKL
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis using Abl (ABL1; 189980) as bait, followed by
5-prime RACE of a mouse liver cDNA library, Cong et al. (1999) cloned
mouse Dok3, which they called Dokl. The deduced 444-amino acid mouse
protein contains an N-terminal PH domain, a central PTB domain, and a
proline-rich C-terminal domain. Dokl is relatively serine/threonine-rich
overall and contains several potential phosphorylation sites for ser/thr
protein kinases. Dokl shares 60% and 57% sequence similarity with p62dok
(DOK1; 602919) over the PH and PTB domains, respectively, with lower
similarity over the C-terminal regions. Northern blot analysis of mouse
tissues detected several species with high expression in spleen and lung
and low levels in other tissues. RNAse protection studies detected very
high Dokl expression in bone marrow and spleen, low expression in
thymus, and no expression in NIH3T3 cells. Immunofluorescence studies
localized Dokl to the cytoplasm in NIH3T3 cells.

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis using Csk (124095) as bait, followed by
5-prime RACE of a mouse fetal thymus cDNA library, Lemay et al. (2000)
independently cloned mouse Dok3. RNAse protection assay of mouse tissues
detected high expression in spleen and bone marrow but not in thymus,
with little or no expression in nonlymphoid organs.

MAPPING

Berger et al. (2010) stated that the DOK3 gene maps to chromosome
5q35.3.

GENE FUNCTION

Using yeast 2-hybrid and immunoprecipitation analysis of Dokl and Abl
mutants, Cong et al. (1999) showed that the Dokl PTB domain bound
phosphotyrosines on Abl in a kinase-dependent manner. In addition, the
Dokl PTB domain bound weakly to insulin receptor (INSR; 147670).
Immunoprecipitation and phosphorylation studies showed that Dokl served
as a substrate for phosphorylation by v-Abl, c-Abl, and Bcr-Abl (see
BCR; 151410). Overexpression of Dokl inhibited v-Abl-dependent
activation of MAPK1 (176948) and v-Abl transforming activity.

Lemay et al. (2000) showed that, in response to immunoreceptor
stimulation, Dok3 was tyrosine phosphorylated by Src (190090) family
members Lck (153390), Fyn (137025), and Lyn (165120).
Immunoprecipitation studies showed that Dok3 bound inhibitors SHIP
(INPP5D; 601582) and Csk (124095) but did not bind RasGAP (RASA1;
139150). Dok3 binding to SHIP occurred via the SH2 domain. Dok3 also
bound Csk via the Csk SH2 domain with possible involvement of the Csk
SH3 domain as well. Overexpression of Dok3 in a murine B-cell line
inhibited immunoreceptor-mediated NFAT (see 600490) activation. Lemay et
al. (2000) concluded that Dok3 acts as an adaptor in the recruitment of
inhibitory molecules and may play a role in negative regulation of
immunoreceptor signaling in hematopoietic cells.

Using a constitutively active form of Src, Honma et al. (2006)
identified Grb2 (108355) as a protein that bound Dok3 downstream of its
tyrosine phosphorylation. Dok3 sequestered Grb2 from Shc (600560),
resulting in negative regulation of the Ras-Erk pathway.

ANIMAL MODEL

Berger et al. (2010) found that mice with knockout of Dok1 (602919),
Dok2 (604997), or Dok3 each developed lung adenocarcinoma (211980). Mice
with double-knockouts of different combinations of these 3 genes
developed lung adenocarcinoma at an earlier age and with high
penetrance, suggesting that the proteins have partially redundant or
overlapping functions. Compared to wildtype lung tissue, Dok-mutant
tumors showed moderate staining for phosphorylated Akt (164730) and
strong staining for phosphorylated Erk (176872). Immunohistochemical
studies on isolated cells showed that the tumor cells arose from a
population of bronchioalveolar stem cells with inactivation of the Dok
proteins. These findings were consistent with a model of tumorigenesis
in which inactivation of the Dok1, Dok2, and Dok3 genes leads to
hyperactivation of Akt and Erk, and an expansion of the stem cells that
differentiate into alveolar type II cells.

600031	TITLE *600031 CHITINASE 1; CHIT1
;;CHITINASE, MACROPHAGE; CHIT;;
CHITOTRIOSIDASE;;
METHYLUMBELLIFERYL-TETRA-N-ACETYLCHITOTETRAOSIDE HYDROLASE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The CHIT1 gene encodes plasma methylumbelliferyl
tetra-N-acetylchitotetraoside hydrolase (chitotriosidase), a human
chitinase (EC 3.2.1.14). Chitinases play a role in degrading the chitin
walls of some microorganisms (Boot et al., 1995).

CLONING

Renkema et al. (1995) purified and characterized the chitotriosidase
protein from the spleen of a patient with Gaucher disease (230800) who
had increased serum CHIT1 enzyme activity. Two major isoforms with
isoelectric points of 7.2 and 8.0 and molecular masses of 50 and 39 kD,
respectively, were found to have identical N-terminal amino acid
sequences. An antiserum raised against the purified 39-kD
chitotriosidase precipitated all isozymes. The findings suggested that a
single gene encodes the different isoforms of chitotriosidase. The
authors postulated that the enzyme may be involved in defense against
and in degradation of chitin-containing pathogens such as fungi,
nematodes, and insects.

Boot et al. (1995) isolated a cDNA corresponding to the chitotriosidase
gene from a macrophage cDNA library. The deduced 445-amino acid protein
has a molecular mass of 49 kD, similar to the larger isoform detected by
Renkema et al. (1995). Secretion of active chitotriosidase was obtained
after transient transfection of COS-1 cells with the cloned cDNA.
Chitotriosidase contains several regions with high homology to those
present in chitinases from different species belonging to family 18 of
glycosylhydrolases. Northern blot analysis showed that expression of
chitotriosidase mRNA occurred only at a late stage of differentiation of
monocytes to activated macrophages in cell culture. The authors
speculated that the enzyme may play a role in the degradation of
chitin-containing pathogens.

GENE STRUCTURE

Boot et al. (1998) determined that the CHIT1 gene contains 12 exons and
spans about 20 kb.

MAPPING

Eiberg and Den Tandt (1997) mapped the CHIT locus to chromosome
1q31-qter between flanking markers D1S191 and D1S245. By fluorescence in
situ hybridization, Boot et al. (1998) assigned the CHIT gene to
1q31-q32.

GENE FUNCTION

Hollak et al. (1994) observed a very marked increase (more than
600-fold) of chitotriosidase activity in the plasma of 30 of 32
symptomatic patients with type I Gaucher disease (230800), which is due
to mutation in the gene encoding beta-glucosidase (GBA; 606463). The
increase in plasma chitotriosidase that they observed in Gaucher disease
patients was far more pronounced than the increase in alkaline
phosphatase (ALPL; 171760), which had been used as an important
diagnostic hallmark of the disease. Chitotriosidase activity declined
dramatically during enzyme supplementation therapy. In contrast, 3
GBA-deficient individuals without clinical symptoms had only slight
increases in chitotriosidase. The authors considered it unlikely that
chitotriosidase itself contributes to the clinical presentation of
Gaucher disease. Hollak et al. (1994) noted that the similarity between
lysozyme (LYZ; 153450) and chitotriosidase with respect to catalytic
activity toward particular substrates suggested that the latter may also
function in host defense mechanisms, e.g., through cleavage of bacterial
cell wall polysaccharide. Hollak et al. (1994) suggested that the
macrophages loaded with glucosylceramide in Gaucher disease are the main
source of the plasma enzyme activity. No elevation, or only moderate
elevation, of plasma chitotriosidase was found in a variety of
granulomatous immunologic disorders.

Boot et al. (1995) noted that homologous chitinases in plants are known
to defend against fungal pathogens. The bactericidal function of
lysozyme is also well established; nevertheless, in rabbits an inherited
deficiency in lysozyme occurs that seems to have little consequence for
susceptibility to infections. The diverse array of defense mechanisms of
the immune system in mammals probably renders sufficient tolerance to
defects in single enzymes such as lysozyme and chitotriosidase.

By comparing the antifungal properties of human macrophage
chitotriosidase and its isolated domains, Vandevenne et al. (2011)
showed that the catalytic domain was sufficient for antifungal activity
and tended to be more efficient than the intact enzyme. In contrast, the
chitin-binding domain did not possess any antifungal properties.
Mutations in chitotriosidase that rendered the macrophage enzyme
inactive could be compensated by lysozyme, which had even greater
antifungal activity than chitotriosidase, as well as antibacterial
activity.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In individuals with chitotriosidase deficiency (614122), Boot et al.
(1998) identified a homozygous 24-bp duplication in the CHIT1 gene
(600031.0001). The observed carrier frequency of about 35% indicated
that the duplication is the predominant cause of chitotriosidase
deficiency. The presence of the duplication in individuals from various
ethnic backgrounds suggested that this mutation is relatively old.

Grace et al. (2007) noted that the identification of CHIT1 gene
mutations that alter plasma activity is important for the use of this
biomarker to monitor disease activity and therapeutic response in
Gaucher disease. They genotyped the CHIT1 gene in 320 unrelated patients
with Gaucher disease, including 272 of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. Among
all patients, 4% and 37.2% were homozygous and heterozygous,
respectively, for the 24-bp duplication. In addition, Grace et al.
(2007) identified 3 novel mutations in the CHIT1 gene
(600031.0002-600031.0004) in individuals with Gaucher disease and
chitotriosidase deficiency.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CHITOTRIOSIDASE DEFICIENCY
CHIT1, 24-BP DUP

Boot et al. (1998) found that chitotriosidase deficiency (614122) can be
caused by a 24-bp duplication in exon 10 of the CHIT1 gene, resulting in
activation of a cryptic 3-prime splice site, generating an mRNA with an
in-frame deletion of 87 nucleotides. All chitotriosidase-deficient
individuals tested were homozygous for the duplication. Among 171 Dutch
persons, 6.4% were homozygous and 35.1% were heterozygous for the
mutation. Among 68 Ashkenazi Jewish subjects, 5.9% were homozygous and
33.8% were heterozygous. The mutant chitotriosidase is predicted to lack
amino acids 344-372. On the basis of homology with several chitinases
for which the 3-dimensional structure has been resolved by
crystallographic analysis, the authors predicted that the internal
deletion in the mutant chitotriosidase prevents the formation of a
proper barrel conformation, with resulting loss of chitinolytic
activity.

Among a total of 320 unrelated patients with Gaucher disease (232800),
including 272 of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, Grace et al. (2007) found
that 4% and 37.2% were homozygous or heterozygous for the CHIT1 24-bp
dup, respectively. The allele frequency was 0.227.

.0002
CHITOTRIOSIDASE DEFICIENCY
CHIT1, GLY354ARG, LEU385LEU, AND 4-BP DEL

In a Caribbean Hispanic/African type 1 Gaucher disease (230800) patient
with chitotriosidase deficiency (614122), Grace et al. (2007) identified
a complex allele of the CHIT1 gene with 3 different variations in cis: a
1060G-A transition in exon 10 resulting in a gly354-to-arg (G354R)
substitution, a 1155G-A transition in exon 10 resulting in a synonymous
leu385-to-leu (L385L) substitution, and a 4-bp deletion in intron 10
(1156delGTAA). The complex allele was designated 'E/I-10'
(exon/intron-10) allele. The patient was compound heterozygous for the
E/I-10 complex allele and the common 24-bp duplication (600031.0001). In
vitro functional expression studies showed that the complex mutant had
no residual enzyme activity. Further screening identified the complex
allele in individuals of Caribbean Hispanic, Dominican, Caribbean Black,
Puerto Rican, and American Black descent. It was not identified in those
of Caucasian or Ashkenazi Jewish descent.

.0003
CHITOTRIOSIDASE DEFICIENCY
CHIT1, GLU74LYS

In a type I Gaucher disease (230800) patient with chitotriosidase
deficiency (614122), Grace et al. (2007) identified a 220G-A transition
in exon 3 of the CHIT1 gene, resulting in a glu74-to-lys (E74K)
substitution. In vitro functional expression studies showed that the
E74K mutant had 51% activity compared to control values. The E74K allele
was found in 3 (1.4%) of 208 Ashkenazi Jewish alleles, but not in
non-Ashkenazi Jewish alleles, indicating that it is very rare. This
mutation was not found in normal controls.

.0004
CHITOTRIOSIDASE DEFICIENCY
CHIT1, GLY102SER

In 3 Ashkenazi Jewish type I Gaucher disease (230800) patients with
chitotriosidase deficiency (614122), Grace et al. (2007) identified a
304G-A transition in exon 4 of the CHIT1 gene, resulting in a
gly102-to-ser (G102S) substitution. In vitro functional expression
studies showed that the G102S mutant had 23% activity compared to
control values. The G102S allele had a frequency of 0.2 to 0.3 in
various control populations.

176910	TITLE *176910 PROTEIN KINASE, cAMP-DEPENDENT, REGULATORY, TYPE II, ALPHA; PRKAR2A
;;PROTEIN KINASE A, RII-ALPHA SUBUNIT
DESCRIPTION See 188830. Phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinases is
essential for sperm motility. A cAMP-dependent protein kinase is bound
to sperm flagella by a regulatory subunit (RII). Oyen et al. (1989)
observed high testis-specific expression of a human homolog to the rat
RII-alpha mRNA induced in haploid germ cells. They cloned a human cDNA
that encodes a 404-amino acid polypeptide with a region (amino acids
45-75) divergent from that of the previously published mouse and rat
sequences.

By PCR and Southern blot analysis of somatic cell hybrid mapping panels

HETEROCHROMATIN PROTEIN 1; HP1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Heterochromatin protein-1 (HP1) is a methyl-lysine binding protein
localized at heterochromatin sites. HP1 mediates gene silencing (summary
by Bannister et al., 2001).

CLONING

At the nuclear envelope in higher eukaryotic cells, the nuclear lamina
and the heterochromatin are adjacent to the inner nuclear membrane.
Using the nucleoplasmic N terminus of lamin B receptor (LBR; 600024), an
integral protein of the inner nuclear membrane, as bait in a yeast
2-hybrid screen of a HeLa cell cDNA library, Ye and Worman (1996)
isolated 2 chromodomain proteins that are homologs of Drosophila HP1.
One of these proteins, CBX5, contains 191 amino acids and was previously
cloned by Saunders et al. (1993). CBX5 shows 65% sequence similarity
with the other identified protein, CBX3 (604477).

Maison et al. (2011) noted that HP1-alpha has an N-terminal
chromodomain, followed by a hinge region and a C-terminal chromoshadow
domain.

GENE FUNCTION

Ye and Worman (1996) found that LBR fusion proteins bound to CBX3 and
CBX5 proteins synthesized by in vitro translation and present in cell
lysates. LBR also coimmunoprecipitated the CBX proteins from cell
extracts. Ye and Worman (1996) suggested that the interaction between
LBR and the chromodomain proteins may explain, in part, the association
of heterochromatin with the inner nuclear membrane.

Lachner et al. (2001) showed that mammalian methyltransferases that
selectively methylate histone H3 (see 602810) on lysine-9 (Suv39h
HMTases; see SUV39H1, 300254) generate a binding site for HP1 proteins,
a family of heterochromatic adaptor molecules implicated in both gene
silencing and supranucleosomal chromatin structure. High-affinity in
vitro recognition of a methylated histone H3 peptide by HP1 requires a
functional chromodomain; thus, the HP1 chromodomain is a specific
interaction motif for the methyl epitope on lysine-9 of histone H3. In
vivo, heterochromatin association of HP1 proteins is lost in Suv39h
double-null primary mouse fibroblasts but is restored after
reintroduction of a catalytically active SUV39H1 HMTase. Lachner et al.
(2001) concluded that their data define a molecular mechanism through
which the SUV39H-HP1 methylation system can contribute to the
propagation of heterochromatic subdomains in native chromatin.

Bannister et al. (2001) demonstrated that HP1 can bind with high
affinity to histone H3 methylated at lysine-9 but not at lysine-4. They
identified the chromodomain of HP1 as its methyl-lysine-binding domain.
A point mutation in the chromodomain, which destroys the gene silencing
activity of HP1 in Drosophila, abolished methyl-lysine-binding activity.
Genetic and biochemical analysis in S. pombe showed that the methylase
activity of Clr4 (the SUV39H1 homolog) is necessary for the correct
localization of Swi6 (the HP1 equivalent) at centromeric heterochromatin
and for gene silencing. Bannister et al. (2001) concluded that these
results provide a stepwise model for the formation of a
transcriptionally silent heterochromatin: SUV39H1 places a methyl marker
on histone H3, which is then recognized by HP1 through its chromodomain.
This model may also explain the stable inheritance of the
heterochromatic state.

Nielsen et al. (2001) demonstrated that SUV39H1 and HP1 are both
involved in the repressive functions of the retinoblastoma protein (RB1;
614041). Rb1 associates with SUV39H1 and HP1 in vivo by means of its
pocket domain. SUV39H1 cooperates with Rb to repress the cyclin E
(123837) promoter, and in fibroblasts that are disrupted for SUV39H1,
the activity of the cyclin E and cyclin A2 (123835) genes are
specifically elevated. Chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that Rb is
necessary to direct methylation of histone H3, and is necessary for
binding of HP1 to the cyclin E promoter. Nielsen et al. (2001) concluded
that the SUV39H1-HP1 complex is not only involved in heterochromatic
silencing but also has a role in repression of euchromatic genes by Rb
and perhaps other corepressor proteins.

Eukaryotic genomes are organized into discrete structural and functional
chromatin domains. Noma et al. (2001) demonstrated that distinct
site-specific histone H3 methylation patterns define euchromatic and
heterochromatic chromosomal domains within an 47-kb region of the
mating-type locus in fission yeast. H3 methylated at lysine-9, and its
interacting Swi6 protein, are strictly localized to a 20-kb silent
heterochromatic interval. In contrast, H3 methylated at lysine-4 is
specific to the surrounding euchromatic regions. Two inverted repeats
flanking the silent interval serve as boundary elements to mark the
borders between heterochromatin and euchromatin. Deletions of these
boundary elements leads to spreading of H3 lys9 methylation and Swi6
into neighboring sequences. Furthermore, the H3 lys6 methylation and
corresponding heterochromatin-associated complexes prevent H3 lys4
methylation in the silent domain.

The higher-order assembly of chromatin imposes structural organization
on the genetic information of eukaryotes and is thought to be largely
determined by posttranslational modification of histone tails. Hall et
al. (2002) studied a 20-kb silent domain at the mating-type region of S.
pombe as a model for heterochromatin formation. They found that although
histone H3 methylated at lys9 directly recruited heterochromatin protein
Swi6/HP1, the critical determinant for H3 lys9 methylation to spread in
cis to be inherited through mitosis and meiosis is Swi6 itself. The
authors demonstrated that a centromere homologous repeat present at the
silent mating-type region is sufficient for heterochromatin formation at
an ectopic site, and that its repressive capacity is mediated by
components of the RNA interference machinery. Moreover, the centromere
homologous repeat and the RNA interference machinery cooperate to
nucleate heterochromatin assembly at the endogenous mating locus but are
dispensable for its subsequent inheritance. Hall et al. (2002) concluded
that their work defines sequential requirements for the initiation and
propagation of regional heterochromatic domains.

Cheutin et al. (2003) demonstrated that maintenance of stable
heterochromatin domains in living cells involves the transient binding
and dynamic exchange of HP1 from chromatin. HP1 exchange kinetics
correlated with the condensation level of chromatin and were dependent
on the histone methyltransferase SUV39H. The chromodomain and the
chromoshadow domain of HP1 are both required for binding to native
chromatin in vivo, but they contribute differentially to binding in
euchromatin and heterochromatin. Cheutin et al. (2003) suggested that
their data argue against HP1 repression of transcription by formation of
static, higher order oligomeric networks but support a dynamic
competition model, and demonstrate that heterochromatin is accessible to
regulatory factors.

Chadwick and Willard (2003) screened over 30 histone variants, modified
histones, and nonhistone proteins for their association with or
exclusion from the Barr body. They demonstrated that HP1, histone H1
(HIST1H1B; 142711), and the high mobility group protein HMGIY (HMGA1;
600701) were elevated at the territory of the inactive X chromosome (Xi)
in interphase in human cell lines, but only when the Xi chromatin was
heteropycnotic, implicating each as a component of the Barr body.
However, virtually all other candidate proteins involved in establishing
heterochromatin and gene silencing were notably absent from the Barr
body, suggesting that the Barr body may represent a discrete subnuclear
compartment that is not freely accessible to most chromatin proteins. A
similar dichotomous pattern of association or exclusion describes the
spatial relationship of a number of specific histone methylation
patterns in relation to the Barr body. The authors hypothesized that the
Xi may adopt a distinct chromatin configuration in interphase nuclei,
consistent with a mechanism by which HP1, through histone H3 (H3F2;
142780) lysine-9 methylation, recognizes and assists in maintaining
heterochromatin and gene silencing at the human Xi.

Following overexpression of MIS12 (609178) in HeLa cells, Obuse et al.
(2004) immunoprecipitated several proteins, including HP1-alpha, that
interacted with MIS12 in a kinetochore-associated complex. Both
HP1-alpha and HP1-gamma (CBX3) interacted directly with MIS12 and
C20ORF172 (609175). Exclusion chromatography revealed 3 peaks containing
MIS12 and C20ORF172, but only the middle peak, which had a mass of 669
kD, contained HP1-alpha. Using HP1 RNA interference (RNAi), Obuse et al.
(2004) found that HP1-alpha and HP1-gamma were functionally redundant.
In double HP1 RNAi, the integrity of kinetochores was abolished and
micronuclei were formed. Obuse et al. (2004) hypothesized that the firm
association of heterochromatic HP1 with the MIS12 complex may be a
fundamental feature of human kinetochore formation.

Fischle et al. (2005) demonstrated that HP1-alpha, HP1-beta (604511),
and HP1-gamma (604477) are released from chromatin during the M phase of
the cell cycle even though trimethylation levels of histone H3 lys9
remain unchanged. However, the additional transient modification of
histone H3 by phosphorylation of ser10 next to the more stable
methyl-lys9 mark is sufficient to eject HP1 proteins from their binding
sites. Inhibition or depletion of the mitotic kinase Aurora B (604970),
which phosphorylates histone H3 on ser10, causes retention of HP1
proteins on mitotic chromosomes, suggesting that H3 ser10
phosphorylation is necessary for the dissociation of HP1 from chromatin
in M phase. Fischle et al. (2005) concluded that their findings
establish a regulatory mechanism of protein-protein interactions,
through a combinatorial readout of 2 adjacent posttranslational
modifications: a stable methylation and a dynamic phosphorylation mark.

Hirota et al. (2005) showed that antibodies against mitotic chromosomal
antigens that are associated with human autoimmune diseases specifically
recognize H3 molecules that are modified by both trimethylation of lys9
and phosphorylation of ser10 (H3K9me3S10ph). The generation of
H3K9me3S10ph depends on Suv39h (see 300254) and Aurora B (604970), and
occurs at pericentric heterochromatin during mitosis in different
eukaryotes. Most HP1 typically dissociates from chromosomes during
mitosis, but if phosphorylation of H3 ser10 is inhibited, HP1 remains
chromosome-bound throughout mitosis. H3 phosphorylation by Aurora B is
therefore part of a 'methyl/phos switch' mechanism that displaces HP1
and perhaps other proteins from mitotic heterochromatin.

Smallwood et al. (2007) demonstrated that DNMT1 (126375) could interact
with HP1-alpha, HP1-beta, and HP1-gamma in a human colon carcinoma cell
line, resulting in stimulation of DNMT1 methyltransferase activity. The
HP1 proteins were sufficient to target DNMT1 activity in vivo, and
HP1-dependent repression required DNMT1. Smallwood et al. (2007)
demonstrated that HP1-alpha and HP1-beta were recruited to the survivin
(BIRC5; 603352) promoter in a DNMT1-dependent manner. They concluded
that direct interactions between HP1 proteins and DNMT1 mediate
silencing of euchromatic genes.

Dawson et al. (2009) showed that human JAK2 (147796) is present in the
nucleus of hematopoietic cells and directly phosphorylates tyr41 (Y41)
on histone H3 (see 601128). HP1-alpha, but not HP1-beta, specifically
binds to this region of H3 through its chromo-shadow domain.
Phosphorylation of H3Y41 by JAK2 prevents this binding. Inhibition of
JAK2 activity in human leukemic cells decreases both the expression of
hematopoietic oncogene LMO2 (180385) and the phosphorylation of H3Y41 at
its promoter, while simultaneously increasing the binding of HP1-alpha
at the same site. Dawson et al. (2009) concluded that their results
identified a previously unrecognized nuclear role for JAK2 in the
phosphorylation of H3Y41 and revealed a direct mechanistic link between
2 genes, JAK2 and LMO2, involved in normal hematopoiesis and leukemia.

Maison et al. (2011) found that mouse Hp1-alpha bound RNA that
originated from the major satellite repeat region of mouse centromeres.
Binding occurred predominantly with RNA transcribed in the forward
orientation. Mutation analysis revealed that the hinge domain of
Hp1-alpha was required for RNA binding. Mass spectrometry revealed that
several lysines within the hinge region were modified by sumoylation and
could accept Sumo1 (601912), Sumo2 (603042), or Sumo3 (602231).
Sumoylation of Hp1-alpha was required for binding major RNAs, and RNA
binding promoted targeting of Hp1-alpha to pericentric heterochromatin.
Subsequent H3K9 methylation appeared to stabilize Hp1-alpha at
pericentric heterochromatin.

The histone methylase SUV39H1 (300254) participates in the
trimethylation of histone H3 on lysine-9 (H3K9me3; see 601128), a
modification that provides binding sites for HP1-alpha and promotes
transcriptional silencing. This pathway was initially associated with
heterochromatin formation and maintenance but can also contribute to the
regulation of euchromatic genes. Allan et al. (2012) proposed that the
SUV39H1-H3K9me3-HP1-alpha pathway participates in maintaining the
silencing of TH1 loci, ensuring TH2 lineage stability. In TH2 cells that
are deficient in SUV39H1, the ratio between trimethylated and acetylated
H3K9 is impaired, and the binding of HP1-alpha at the promoters of
silenced TH1 genes is reduced. Despite showing normal differentiation,
both SUV39H1-deficient TH2 cells and HP1-alpha-deficient TH2 cells, in
contrast to wildtype cells, expressed TH1 genes when recultured under
conditions that drive differentiation into TH1 cells. In a mouse model
of TH2-driven allergic asthma, the chemical inhibition or loss of
SUV39H1 skewed T-cell responses towards TH1 responses and decreased the
lung pathology.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

N-acetylneuraminate pyruvate lyase (EC 4.1.3.3) controls the cellular
concentration of sialic acid by catalyzing the conversion of sialic acid
into acylmannosamines and pyruvate (Wu et al., 2005).

CLONING

By searching for genes in a region of chromosome 1 associated with
hereditary prostate cancer (HPC1; 601518), followed by screening cDNA
libraries, Sood et al. (2001) cloned NPL, which they called C112. The
deduced protein contains 320 amino acids. Northern blot analysis
detected weak expression of a 5-kb transcript in all human tissues
examined.

By large-scale sequence analysis of clones obtained from a fetal brain
cDNA library, Wu et al. (2005) cloned a splice variant of NPL. The
deduced 301-amino acid splice variant, which they called NPLV2, contains
an N-terminal dihydrodipicolinate synthase (DHDPS) domain and 5 putative
N-terminal phosphorylation sites. RT-PCR detected highest expression in
liver, kidney, and peripheral blood leukocytes, and lower expression in
placenta, pancreas, spleen, thymus, ovary, and small intestine. By
database analysis, Wu et al. (2005) identified 3 other NPL splice
variants.

GENE STRUCTURE

Wu et al. (2005) determined that the NPL gene contains 11 exons and
spans over 40 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Sood et al. (2001) mapped the NPL gene to
chromosome 1q25.

614143	TITLE *614143 IGF-LIKE FAMILY RECEPTOR 1; IGFLR1
;;TRANSMEMBRANE PROTEIN 149; TMEM149
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

IGFLR1 is a receptor for IGFL1 (610544), which is upregulated in
psoriatic skin and in keratinocytes treated with TNF (191160) (Lobito et
al., 2011).

CLONING

By screening a human protein microarray with IGFL1, Lobito et al. (2011)
identified IGFLR1. The deduced 355-amino acid transmembrane protein has
an extracellular domain containing 12 conserved cysteines and a
conserved cytoplasmic region containing a putative death domain. IGFLR1
is conserved in mammals and fish. Sequence and structural analyses
indicated that IGFLR1 is a TNF receptor family member that is specific
for IGFL ligands. RT-PCR analysis of mouse tissues showed ubiquitous
expression of Igflr1, with highest expression in lymph node. RT-PCR of
sorted mouse splenocytes revealed highest expression of Igflr1 in T
cells. FACS analysis demonstrated surface expression of human IGFLR1 on
transfected cells.

GENE FUNCTION

By screening and reverse screening of a human protein microarray, Lobito
et al. (2011) confirmed that IGFLR1 interacted with IGFL1. IGFL3
(610546), though only 37% identical to IGFL1, also bound tightly to
IGFLR1. IGFL2 (610545) bound IGFLR1 more weakly, but IGFL4 (610547) did
not interact with IGFLR1.

MAPPING

Gross (2011) mapped the IGFLR1 gene to chromosome 19q13.12 based on an
alignment of the IGFLR1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC031329) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

602201	TITLE *602201 EXTRACELLULAR MATRIX PROTEIN 1; ECM1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Mathieu et al. (1994) identified a novel 85-kD protein secreted by a
mouse osteogenic stromal cell line. Bhalerao et al. (1995) showed that
the full-length cDNA is 1.9 kb and contains an open reading frame of
1,677 bp that codes for a protein of 559 amino acids.

Smits et al. (1997) described a genomic clone containing the human
homolog, termed extracellular matrix protein 1 (ECM1), from a chromosome
1 cosmid library. The ECM1 gene appeared to be expressed as a 1.8-kb
transcript predominantly in placenta and heart, while an additional
1.4-kb alternatively spliced message was detected in tonsils. The
full-length human ECM1 transcript contains 1,838 bp and has an overall
homology of 79.6% with the mouse Ecm1 cDNA. The transcript codes for a
protein of 540 amino acids that is 69.4% identical and 81.3% similar to
the corresponding mouse protein. The alternatively spliced variant,
1,450 bp long, encodes a protein of 415 amino acids.

GENE STRUCTURE

Smits et al. (1997) demonstrated that the coding region of the human
ECM1 gene comprises 10 exons.

Oyama et al. (2003) noted that HLA-subtype susceptibility and high rates
of other autoimmune disorders suggest that autoantibodies to specific
mucocutaneous antigens may be involved in the etiology of lichen
sclerosis (151590). The clinicopathologic similarities between lichen
sclerosis and lipoid proteinosis, which results from mutations in ECM1,
suggested that this protein may be an autoantigen in lichen sclerosis.
By immunoblotting, IgG autoantibodies to ECM1 were found in 20 of 30
lichen sclerosis serum samples. The highest titer was 1 in 20. These
samples, and those from 56 other patients with lichen sclerosis, showed
immunoreactivity to the recombinant ECM1 protein; 6 of 85 control serum
samples were positive. The findings suggested that specific humeral
immune response to ECM1 may be involved in the etiology of lichen
sclerosis and may offer help in disease diagnosis, monitoring, and
approaches to treatment.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Smits et al. (1997) mapped the
ECM1 gene to 1q21 outside the epidermal differentiation complex region
(see 152445). Bhalerao et al. (1995) mapped the gene to mouse chromosome
3.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Lipoid proteinosis, also known as hyalinosis cutis et mucosae or
Urbach-Wiethe disease (247100), is a rare, autosomal recessive disorder
typified by generalized thickening of skin, mucosae, and certain
viscera. Classic features include beaded eyelid papules and laryngeal
infiltration leading to hoarseness. Histologically, there is widespread
deposition of hyaline (glycoprotein) material and
disruption/reduplication of basement membrane. Using DNA from 6
consanguineous families, Hamada et al. (2002) mapped the disorder to
chromosome 1q21 at marker D1S498 (lod = 21.85 at theta = 0), within a
2.3-cM critical region. Using a candidate gene approach, the authors
identified 6 different homozygous loss-of-function mutations in ECM1.

LIPOID PROTEINOSIS OF URBACH AND WIETHE
ECM1, 1-BP DEL, 1019A

In affected individuals of a consanguineous Kuwaiti family with lipoid
proteinosis (247100), Hamada et al. (2002) identified homozygosity for a
single-basepair deletion (A1019) in exon 7 of the ECM1 gene. The
mutation resulted in a premature stop codon 108 bp downstream.

Hamada et al. (2002) identified a 14-year old Pakistani boy with lipoid
proteinosis (247100); he was the product of a consanguineous mating, and
was homozygous for a C-to-T transition at position 1036 in exon 7 of the
ECM1 gene. The mutation resulted in conversion of codon gln346 to a
premature stop codon (Q346X).

.0003

ECM1, 1163-BP DEL

Hamada et al. (2002) reported 4 sibs affected with lipoid proteinosis
(247100) within a consanguineous Saudi family. All affected individuals
were homozygous for an 1163-bp deletion in the ECM1 gene, which
eliminated part of intron 8 and all of exons 9 and 10.

In 2 unrelated subjects with lipoid proteinosis (247100) with different
ECM1 haplotypes, Hamada et al. (2003) identified a 507delT mutation in
exon 6 of the ECM1 gene. The authors suggested that the deletion, which
causes a frameshift and premature termination 23 bp downstream, may
represent a recurrent mutation in lipoid proteinosis.

608122	TITLE *608122 PARVIN, GAMMA; PARVG
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the parvin family, including PARVG, are actin-binding
proteins associated with focal contacts.

CLONING

By searching EST databases for sequences similar to mouse Parva
(608120), followed by RT-PCR of a human T-cell line cDNA library, Olski
et al. (2001) cloned human PARVG. Mouse and human PARVG encode a deduced
331-amino acid protein that contains a single actin-binding domain made
up of 2 calponin (600806) homology domains separated by a linker region.
Unlike PARVA and PARVB (608121), the N terminus of PARVG does not
contain nuclear localization signals or SH3-binding domains.

By analyzing PARVG ESTs, Korenbaum et al. (2001) identified
alternatively spliced sequences and a single polyadenylation site.
Northern blot analysis revealed a strong smeared signal in heart, liver,
and several other tissues. Bands of about 1.6 and 4.0 kb were detected
in peripheral blood and spleen. RNA dot blot analysis detected highest
expression in lymphatic organs (spleen, thymus, lymph node, bone marrow,
and peripheral blood leukocytes) and moderate expression in the
digestive tract (stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, ileocecum, and
appendix), lung, and liver. In contrast, mouse Parvg showed highest
expression in testis, where there were at least 6 mRNA species. A 2.8-kb
Parvg transcript was expressed highly in spleen, moderately in lung, and
weakly in brain and heart. Parvg was expressed throughout mouse
embryonic development, with downregulation at embryonic day 11.
Korenbaum et al. (2001) stated that fluorescence-tagged PARVG, like
PARVA, localized at focal contacts.

GENE STRUCTURE

Korenbaum et al. (2001) determined that the PARVG gene contains 15 exons
and spans about 25 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Korenbaum et al. (2001) mapped the PARVG
gene to chromosome 22q13.31, where it lies head to tail about 12 kb
telomeric to the PARVB gene.

604100	TITLE *604100 GLUTAMATE RECEPTOR, METABOTROPIC, 4; GRM4
;;MGLUR4
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

L-glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the central
nervous system and activates both ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate
receptors, such as GRM4. The metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs),
which are G protein-coupled receptors, have been divided into 3 groups
on the basis of sequence homology, putative signal transduction
mechanisms, and pharmacologic properties. Group II and group III mGluRs
are linked to the inhibition of the cyclic AMP cascade, but differ in
their agonist selectivities. Group III agonists include
L-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyrate (L-AP4) and L-serine-O-phosphate (summary
by Wu et al., 1998).

CLONING

Using a PCR strategy with primers based on consensus regions of rat
mGluR1-5, Makoff et al. (1996) isolated partial cDNAs corresponding to
the human homologs of these genes. By probing a cerebellum library with
the partial human mGluR4 cDNA, the authors isolated additional mGluR4
cDNAs which between them contained the complete coding sequence for the
human protein. The predicted 912-amino acid human mGluR4 protein shares
90% identity with rat mGluR4. Northern blot analysis of human tissues
revealed that the approximately 5-kb mGluR4 mRNA was only expressed in
brain. In situ hybridization to brain tissues indicated that human
mGluR4 mRNA, like that of rat mGluR4, has a narrow distribution. In both
organisms, the highest level of expression was detected in the granule
cells of the cerebellum. Wu et al. (1998) isolated cDNAs encoding 3
human group III mGluRs, mGluR4, mGluR7 (604101) and mGluR8 (601116), and
compared the pharmacologic properties of these receptors.

By database analysis, Bjarnadottir et al. (2005) identified GRM4
orthologs in mouse and fish. The deduced mouse protein contains 912
amino acids.

GENE STRUCTURE

Bjarnadottir et al. (2005) determined that the GRM4 gene contains 7
exons.

MAPPING

Barbon et al. (2000) mapped the GRM4 gene to chromosome 6p21.3 by
radiation hybrid mapping.

Bjarnadottir et al. (2005) mapped the mouse Grm4 gene to chromosome 17.

ANIMAL MODEL

To provide a better understanding of the L-AP4 receptors, Pekhletski et
al. (1996) generated knockout mice lacking the mGluR4 gene. The mutant
mice did not display any gross motor abnormalities, impairments of
novelty-induced exploratory behaviors, or alterations in fine motor
coordination. However, they were deficient on the rotating rod
motor-learning test, suggesting that they may have an impaired ability
to learn complex motor tasks. Analysis of presynaptic short-term
synaptic plasticity at the parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapse
demonstrated that paired-pulse facilitation and post-tetanic
potentiation were impaired in the mutant mice, although long-term
depression was unaffected. Pekhletski et al. (1996) concluded that an
important function of mGluR4 is to provide a presynaptic mechanism for
maintaining synaptic efficacy during repetitive activation, and that the
presence of mGluR4 at the parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapse is
required for maintaining normal motor function. Gerlai et al. (1998)
found that mGluR4 mutant mice exhibited significantly accelerated
learning performance in a spatial reversal learning task. In a probe
trial administered 6 weeks posttraining, the mice showed impaired
spatial accuracy. These results suggested that mGluR4 mutant mice differ
in their ability to learn and integrate new spatial information into
previously formed memory traces and that their use of stored spatial
information is altered.

Fallarino et al. (2010) observed that mGluR4-null mice were markedly
vulnerable to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse
model of multiple sclerosis (MS; 126200), and developed immune responses
dominated by IL17 (603149)-producing T helper (TH17) cells. MGluR4 was
constitutively expressed on dendritic cells isolated from wildtype mice.
Signaling through mGluR4 decreased commitment to the TH17 phenotype by
decreasing intracellular cAMP. Treatment of wildtype mice with a
selective mGluR4 enhancer increased EAE resistance and offered a
protective response via a shift toward regulatory CD4+ T cells. In
contrast, dendritic cells from mGluR4-null mice showed defective mGluR4
signaling with resultant bias toward the TH17 phenotype. The findings
provided evidence that glutamate acts at the interface between the
nervous and immune systems, with mGluR4 present on dendritic cells in
the central nervous system. Fallarino et al. (2010) suggested that the
high amounts of glutamate associated with neuroinflammation might
reflect a counterregulatory mechanism that is protective in nature by
decreasing activation of pathogenic IL17-producing T cells.

;;EXTRACELLULAR MATRIX GLYCOPROTEIN ES/130, CHICKEN, HOMOLOG OF; ES130
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

To clone genes for proteins involved in the formation of cardiac
mesenchyme, Rezaee et al. (1993) used anti-cardiac extracellular matrix
polyclonal antibodies to screen an embryonic chicken cardiocyte
expression library. They used cultured chicken embryonic cardiocytes
because the conditioned medium from such cultures induced
epithelial/mesenchymal transformation; also, it was easier to obtain
good quality RNA from cultured tissue. They identified a 130-kD protein
and designated the protein ES/130. ES/130, which is expressed in
endocardial cushions, was viewed as a candidate for a central role in
atrioventricular septal defect because expression of the gene in the
myocardium induces expression of the same gene in the endocardium.
Basson et al. (1996) stated that ES/130 is also expressed in noncardiac
chicken tissues such as limb and notochord.

Basson et al. (1996) identified the human homolog of chicken ES/130.
RT-PCR studies revealed that human ES130 is expressed in both fetal and
adult tissue and that its expression in the left ventricle is increased
in the failing adult heart.

MAPPING

Basson et al. (1996) localized the human ES/130 gene to chromosome
20p12-p11.2 by fluorescence in situ hybridization.

- Exclusion Studies

By FISH analysis of individuals with Alagille syndrome (118450) and
deletions of 20p12, Basson et al. (1996) excluded ES/130 as a candidate
gene for this disorder.

116945	TITLE *116945 MINICHROMOSOME MAINTENANCE, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF, 2; MCM2
;;MITOTIN;;
CELL DIVISION CYCLE-LIKE 1; CDCL1;;
NUCLEAR PROTEIN BM28; BM28
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MCM2, also called CDCL1 and BM28, is a human nuclear protein that plays
an important role in 2 crucial steps of the cell cycle, namely, onset of
DNA replication and cell division (Mincheva et al., 1994). It is similar
to members of the family of early S-phase proteins.

CLONING

The replication of DNA occurs only once per cell cycle in eukaryotes.
Blow and Laskey (1988) attempted to explain this tight control by
proposing the existence of a hypothetical licensing factor that would
bind to chromatin during mitosis to permit DNA replication during the
ensuing S phase in Xenopus egg extracts. Kubota et al. (1995), Chong et
al. (1995), and Madine et al. (1995) identified a replication licensing
activity in a complex containing MCM/P1 family proteins in Xenopus
oocytes. Burkhart et al. (1995) showed that human MCM2 and MCM5 (602696)
proteins form a complex. Hu et al. (1993) reported cDNA sequences for 5
MCM/P1 family members.

MAPPING

Using plasmid DNA containing the complete coding sequence of the CDCL1
gene as a probe for fluorescence in situ hybridization, Mincheva et al.
(1994) mapped the gene to 3q21. From its localization, CDCL1 became a
candidate for an oncogene affected by chromosomal breaks in acute
myeloid leukemia (AML).

GENE FUNCTION

Tsuruga et al. (1997) reported the comparative analysis of the human MCM
proteins MCM2, MCM3 (602693), MCM5, and MCM7 (600592). The 4 MCM
proteins underwent unequal regulation, suggesting that they play
somewhat distinct roles in the regulation of the mammalian cell cycle.
The mRNA levels of these genes underwent cell cycle-dependent
oscillations with a peak at G1/S phase; they may be regulated by E2F
motifs (see E2F1; 189971), 2 of which were detected in the 5-prime
regulatory region of the MCM5 gene. In contrast, the levels of these MCM
proteins remained rather constant during the HeLa cell cycle. However,
their levels gradually increased in a variable manner as normal cells
progressed from G0 into the G1/S phase. In the G0 stage, the MCM2 and
MCM5 proteins were much less abundant than the MCM7 and MCM3 proteins.
This suggests that the MCM proteins are not present in stoichiometric
amounts and that only a proportion of these molecules actively
participate in cell cycle regulation as part of MCM complexes.

Using an improved method for constructing conditional degron mutants,
Labib et al. (2000) demonstrated that depletion of minichromosome
maintenance protein complexes after initiation irreversibly blocks the
progression of replication forks in S. cerevisiae. Their experiments
demonstrated that MCM complex is loaded at origins before initiation and
is essential for elongation. Disruption of any one of the MCMs resulted
in cells that were unable to complete the S phase, indicating that all
MCM proteins are equally important for chromosome replication to
continue after the activation of early origins of DNA replication. Labib
et al. (2000) concluded that restricting MCM loading to the G1 phase
ensures that initiation and elongation occur just once per cell cycle.

The MCM2-7 complex is comprised of 6 subunits, MCM2 through MCM7, and is
a ring-shaped heterohexameric ATPase involved in DNA replication. In
Xenopus egg extracts, Pacek et al. (2006) showed that the MCM2-7
complex, the GINS complex (see GINS1; 610608), and Cdc45 (CDC45L;
603465) were enriched at stalled replication forks. They proposed that
these components unwind DNA and separate DNA strands at replication
forks.

Groth et al. (2007) characterized the complex in which the human histone
chaperone ASF1 (see 609189) and MCM2-7, the putative replicative
helicase, are connected through a histone H3-H4 bridge. Depletion of
ASF1 by RNA interference impeded DNA unwinding at replication sites, and
similar defects arose from overproduction of new histone H3-H4 that
compromised ASF1 function. Groth et al. (2007) concluded that their data
link ASF1 chaperone function, histone supply, and replicative unwinding
of DNA in chromatin. Groth et al. (2007) proposed that ASF1, as a
histone acceptor and donor, handles parental and new histones at the
replication fork via an ASF1-(H3-H4)-MCM2-7 intermediate and thus
provides a means to fine-tune replication fork progression and histone
supply and demand.

609590	TITLE *609590 QUAKING, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF; QKI
;;QK1;;
QK
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

QKI belongs to a family of RNA-binding proteins that have an HNRNPK
(600712) homology (KH) domain embedded in a 200-amino acid region called
the GSG domain. Other members of this family include SAM68 (KHDRBS1;
602489) and SF1 (601516) (Chen and Richard, 1998). QKI proteins regulate
RNA splicing, export of target RNAs from the nucleus, translation of
proteins, and RNA stability (Lauriat et al., 2008).

CLONING

Ebersole et al. (1996) identified several splice variants of mouse Qki
that could be grouped into 2 classes based on size. The longer mRNAs (7,
6, and 5 kb) were abundant in mouse brain, whereas the shorter mRNAs
(1.5 to 1.9 kb) were less abundant. The longer variants encode deduced
proteins containing an N-terminal proline-rich domain, followed by 2 RG
boxes, a second proline-rich region, a central GSG/STAR domain, a third
proline-rich domain, and 5 tyrosines preceding alternative C-terminal
ends. The GSG domain consists of a KH domain flanked by evolutionarily
conserved quaking (QUA) domains 1 and 2. Qki also has 7 SH3-binding
sites dispersed throughout its sequence. Qki expression peaked in
16-day-old myelinating mouse brain. A splice variant was also detected
in newborn testis. In situ hybridization of normal mouse brain showed
Qki transcripts in myelinating tracts in the cerebellum. Ebersole et al.
(1996) identified multiple QKI transcripts in human, rodent, chicken,
and frog.

By Northern blot analysis, Hardy et al. (1996) found that the 5-, 6-,
and 7-kb Qki mRNAs, which they designated Qki-5, Qki-6, and Qki-7,
respectively, were variably expressed in developing and adult mouse
brain. Levels of Qki-5 declined dramatically after the second postnatal
week, whereas levels of Qki-6 and Qki-7 declined modestly thereafter.
Immunohistochemical analysis detected all 3 proteins in myelinating
cells of the central and peripheral nervous system and in astrocytes.
The isoforms showed distinct intracellular distributions, however, with
Qki-6 and Qki-7 localized to perikaryal cytoplasm and Qki-5 restricted
to nucleus.

Noveroske et al. (2002) found that Qki was expressed in the yolk sac
endoderm in mice, adjacent to developing blood islands.

Using quantitative RT-PCR, Lauriat et al. (2008) found that QKI-5 showed
no significant differences in expression across various age groups in
human prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus. However, QKI-5 was the
only QKI variant expressed at high levels in fetal PFC. QKI-6 expression
increased in PFC in a linear fashion with age, with a substantial
increase between 1 to 2 months and 1 to 2 years of age. In human
hippocampus, QKI-6 expression increased at 1 to 2 years of age, remained
high during childhood, and decreased in adulthood. QKI-7a generally
showed a linear trend toward increased expression in PFC with age, but
there was a peak at 1 to 2 years of age. QKI-7b expression in PFC did
not vary significantly with age due to greater variability between
individuals, but there was a trend toward an increase with age. In
hippocampus, QKI-7a and QKI-7b showed a trend toward decreased
expression in adulthood, similar to QKI-6, but there was greater
variability between individuals. Lauriat et al. (2008) noted that
expression of QKI-6 and QKI-7 in PFC increased during the period of
active myelination.

By sequencing mRNAs expressed in primary cultures of human astrocytes,
Radomska et al. (2013) identified QKI5, QKI6, QKI7, QKI7b, and a novel
variant that they called QKI6b. QKI6b differs from other QKI variants in
the 3-prime UTR and encodes a protein identical to that encoded by QKI6.
QKI6 and QKI6b were the most abundant QKI transcripts detected in human
astrocytes, and QKI5 was the least abundant. Immunohistochemical
analysis with isoform-specific antibodies revealed that QKI6 and QKI7
were uniformly distributed throughout the nucleus, cell body, and
processes, whereas QKI5 localized to nuclei and was excluded from
nucleoli. Western blot analysis detected QKI6 at an apparent molecular
mass of 38 kD. Both QKI5 and QKI7 had apparent molecular masses of about
40 kD.

GENE STRUCTURE

Backx et al. (2010) noted that the QKI gene contains 8 exons.

MAPPING

Backx et al. (2010) stated that the QKI gene maps to chromosome 6q26.

The mouse Qki gene maps to chromosome 17 (Ebersole et al., 1996).

GENE FUNCTION

Chen and Richard (1998) showed that the mouse Qk1 proteins homodimerized
in vivo, and they determined that the GSG domain mediated dimerization
and RNA binding. Self-association was mediated by a region of QUA1
predicted to form coiled coils.

Larocque et al. (2002) found that mouse Qk1 proteins bound a short
element in the 3-prime UTR of Mbp (159430). The balance between the
nuclear and cytoplasmic isoforms of Qk1 controlled the nuclear export of
Mbp mRNAs and the cellular localization of the 17- and 21.5-kD Mbp
isoforms. Overexpression of Qki-5 in cultured rodent oligodendrocytes
recreated the Mbp defects observed in qk(v) mice, with retention of Mbp
in the nucleus. Larocque et al. (2002) concluded that the QKI proteins
have a role in myelination.

In an mRNA analysis of 55 control human brains, Aberg et al. (2006)
found that QKI mRNA levels accounted for 47% of the coordinated
variation of mRNA levels of 6 oligodendrocyte-related genes, PLP1
(300401), MAG (159460), MBP, TF (190000), SOX10 (602229), and CDKN1B
(600778). In silico analysis identified potential QKI-binding sites in
all of the genes except TF. Variation in the relative expression of
splice variant QKI-7 explained a large fraction of additional mRNA
variation in 3 highly coexpressed genes, MAG, PLP1, and TF. Analysis of
55 brains from patients with schizophrenia (see 181500) showed
significantly decreased expression of MAG, PLP1, and TF compared to
control brains that was associated with decreased levels of QKI-7. Aberg
et al. (2006) concluded that QKI is a regulator of oligodendrocyte
differentiation and maturation in the human brain, and suggested that
splice variants of QKI may play a role in myelin and oligodendrocyte
dysfunction in schizophrenia.

Using yeast 2-hybrid screens, coaffinity purification analysis of
transfected HEK293 cells, and bioinformatic analysis, Lim et al. (2006)
developed an interaction network for 54 human proteins involved in 23
inherited ataxias. By database analysis, they expanded the core network
to include more distantly related interacting proteins that could
function as genetic modifiers. RBPMS (601558) was a main hub in the
network and interacted with many proteins, including the cerebellar
ataxia-associated proteins ATN1 (607462) and QK1.

Using a rat cell line and primary mixed glial cultures from neonatal rat
brain, Chen et al. (2007) showed that Qk1 was necessary and sufficient
for oligodendroglia progenitor cell differentiation. Qk1 isoforms 5, 6,
and 7 differed in their ability to promote oligodendroglia
differentiation, which was dependent on the RNA-binding ability of Qk1.
RNA interference-mediated Qk1 knockdown abrogated differentiation
without affecting proliferation capacity or cell cycle progression.

Using qualitative RT-PCR, Lauriat et al. (2008) examined expression of
putative QKI target mRNAs, including MAGI1 (602625), BCAS1 (602968),
CDKN1B, PLP1, and MAG, in human prefrontal cortex and hippocampus from
fetus to adulthood (up to 46 years of age). Most of the putative QKI
target mRNAs showed increased expression with increasing age in
prefrontal cortex. However, there was little evidence of developmental
regulation of these mRNAs in hippocampus.

Using small interfering RNA, Radomska et al. (2013) found that knockdown
of QKI7 in cultured human astrocytes reduced expression of an astrocyte
differentiation marker, GFAP (137780), but did not reduce cell
viability. The dominant GFAP variant expressed in the astrocytes,
GFAP-alpha, was the most highly downregulated. Radomska et al. (2013)
identified a core QKI regulatory element (QRE) in the 3-prime UTR of the
GFAP-alpha transcript and a potential upstream half-site. The QRE, but
not the half-site, was conserved in mouse Gfap. Exposure of astrocytes
to the antipsychotic drug haloperidol specifically increased expression
of QKI7 and GFAP transcripts.

CYTOGENETICS

Backx et al. (2010) reported a woman with borderline mental retardation
and dysmorphic features who had a de novo reciprocal balanced
translocation t(5;6)(q23.1;q26) disrupting the QKI gene. The 5q
breakpoint occurred in a gene desert. RNA studies showed a 50% reduction
in QKI expression, consistent with haploinsufficiency. She presented at
birth with hypotonia, short neck, genital hypoplasia with underdeveloped
labia majora, and facial dysmorphism including epicanthal folds, narrow
palpebral fissures, broad nasal bridge with small nose and bulbous tip,
small mouth with downturned corners, a long philtrum, and small
protruding cupped ears. She attended special education schools.
Evaluation at age 23 years showed relative microcephaly,
microretrognathia, small mouth with high-arched palate, myopia, and
nasal speech. She also had inverted nipples and irregular menses.
Seizures and brain anomalies were not present.

Backx et al. (2010) provided a literature review of 18 patients reported
with chromosome 6qter deletions and 2 patients reported with
interstitial 6q deletion. All deletions included the QKI gene. They
noted that while the deletion sizes varied a common recognizable
phenotype of intellectual disabilities, hypotonia, seizures, brain
anomalies, and specific dysmorphic facial features could be distilled
for the chromosome 6qter deletion syndrome.

ANIMAL MODEL

Recessive mutations in the mouse quaking gene affect myelination and
embryogenesis and can be embryonic lethal. A spontaneous, recessive
quaking mutation, qk(v), results in viable mice with a severe deficit in
myelin, leading to rapid tremor by postnatal day 10. By Northern blot
analysis, Ebersole et al. (1996) detected a truncated Qki message in
brains of qk(v) mice.

Hardy et al. (1996) found that Qki-6 and Qki-7 were absent from
myelin-forming cells in qk(v) mice. Qki-5 was absent only from
oligodendrocytes of tracts from severely affected qk(v) brain regions.

Wu et al. (2002) found misregulated alternative splicing of several
myelin genes in qk(v) mice.

Lu et al. (2003) presented evidence that the qk(v) mutation affects an
enhancer required for expression of Qki in myelinating cells but not in
other tissues.

Chen and Richard (1998) determined that a point mutation within the QUA1
region of Qk1 caused embryonic lethality in mice. The mutation abolished
Qk1 self-association but had no effect on RNA-binding activity.
Expression of wildtype Qk1 or a lethal mutant Qk1 deficient in
self-association but not RNA binding induced cell death by apoptosis in
a mouse fibroblast cell line. The lethal Qk1 mutant was more potent at
inducing apoptosis.

Noveroske et al. (2002) found that embryonic mice with a lethal point
mutation in Qki had defective yolk sac vascular remodeling and abnormal
vessels in the embryo proper at midgestation, coinciding with embryonic
death.

Noveroske et al. (2005) isolated qk(e5), an N-ethyl-N-nitrosurea-induced
viable allele of mouse Qki. Unlike qk(v)/qk(v) mice, qk(e5)/qk(e5) mice
had early-onset seizures, severe ataxia, and a dramatically reduced life
span. Ultrastructural analysis of qk(e5)/qk(e5) brains revealed severe
dysmyelination when compared with both wildtype and qk(v)/qk(v) brains.
Young adult qk(e5)/qk(e5) mice exhibited Purkinje cell axonal swellings
indicative of neurodegeneration, which is not seen in young adult
qk(v)/qk(v) mice. The molecular defect in the qk(e5) allele was not
evident, but protein expression studies showed that qk(e5)/qk(e5)
postnatal oligodendrocytes lacked Qki-6 and Qki-7 and had reduced Qki-5
levels. Several oligodendrocyte developmental markers were present in
qk(e5)/qk(e5) postnatal brain, but Cnp (123830) and Mbp levels were
considerably reduced. Noveroske et al. (2005) noted that qk(v) is a
large deletion that affects expression of Pacrg (608427) and Parkin
(PARK2; 602544) in addition to Qki, complicating interpretation of its
neuropathology. Thus, they suggested that qk(e5) may be useful in
studying QKI regulation in the developing central nervous system and its
role in myelination.

Wilson et al. (2010) noted that the qk(v) phenotype, which includes
dysmyelination of the central nervous system and male sterility, is due
to reduced expression of Qk and a complete lack of Pacrg expression,
respectively. Since Pacrg is required for correct development of the
spermatozoan flagella (a specialized type of motile cilia), Wilson et
al. (2010) analyzed qk(v) mutant mice for evidence of cilial
dysfunction. Histologic and magnetic resonance imaging analyses
demonstrated that qk(v) mutant mice were affected by acquired,
communicating hydrocephalus (HC). Structure of axonemal microtubules and
density of ciliated cells were normal, and cilia length was similar to
wildtype littermates. There was a reduction in ependymal cilial beat
frequency and cilial-mediated flow in qk(v) mutant mice compared with
wildtype littermate controls. Transgenic expression of Pacrg was
necessary and sufficient to correct this deficit and rescue the HC
phenotype in the qk(v) mutant. Wilson et al. (2010) concluded that Pacrg
is required for motile cilia function and may be involved in the
pathogenesis of human ciliopathies, such as HC, asthenospermia, and
primary ciliary dyskinesia.

;;CD28 ANTIGEN LIGAND 2; CD28LG2;;
B-LYMPHOCYTE ACTIVATION ANTIGEN B7-2; LAB7-2;;
B72 ANTIGEN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Induction of an immune response requires that T cells receive 2 sets of
signals from antigen-presenting cells. The first signal is delivered
through the T-cell receptor complex, while the second is provided by the
B-cell activation antigens B7-1, or CD80 (112203), and B7-2, or CD86, by
interaction with the T-cell surface molecules, CD28 (186760) and CTLA4
(123890). A cDNA for B7-2 was obtained by Freeman et al. (1993). B7-2
mRNA is constitutively expressed in unstimulated B cells. The predicted
protein is a type I membrane protein of the immunoglobin superfamily.

Jeannin et al. (2000) detected a soluble form of CD86 in human serum
that could be generated either by shedding of the membrane form or
through alternative splicing. RT-PCR analysis revealed the expression of
2 transcripts in nonstimulated monocytes but only the full-length
transmembrane form in activated monocytes. The smallest transcript, 828
bp, which the authors termed CD86deltaTM, has a deletion from nucleotide
686 to nucleotide 829 (i.e., exon 6) and encodes a 275-amino acid
protein. SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis detected expression of CD86
and CD86deltaTM in COS cells as 65- and 48-kD proteins, respectively.
FACS analysis detected only CD86 transfected cells and ELISA analysis
detected only CD86deltaTM in cell-free supernatants. Binding analysis
demonstrated that CD86deltaTM binds to CD28- or CTLA4-expressing cells.
Functional analysis indicated that CD86deltaTM enhances proliferation
and cytokine production by both naive and memory T cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Resting eosinophils express neither MHC class II proteins or
costimulatory B7 molecules and fail to induce proliferation of T cells
to antigens. Celestin et al. (2001) reported that IL3 (147740) induces
expression of HLA-DR and B7.2 on eosinophils, but, unlike IL5 (147580)
and GMCSF (CSF2; 138960), it does not induce expression of B7.1.
IL3-treated eosinophils supported modest T-cell proliferation in
response to superantigen toxic shock syndrome-1 antigen, as well as
proliferation of HLA-DR-restricted T-cell clones to tetanus toxoid (TT)
and influenza virus antigenic peptides. The response was blocked by
anti-B7.2 monoclonal antibody. IL3-treated eosinophils were unable to
present native TT antigen to either resting or TT-specific cloned T
cells. Parallel experiments established that IL5 and GMCSF induce T-cell
proliferation to peptides but not to native TT antigen. Celestin et al.
(2001) suggested that eosinophils activated by IL3 may contribute to
T-cell activation in allergic and parasitic diseases by presenting
superantigens and peptides to T cells.

An immune response against thyroid carcinoma could be important for
long-term survival. Gupta et al. (2001) reported that infiltration of
thyroid carcinoma by proliferating lymphocytes is associated with
improved disease-free survival. Shah et al. (2002) hypothesized that the
antigen presentation coactivators B71 (112203) and B72, which are
important in other immune-mediated thyroid diseases, might be important
in lymphocytic infiltration of thyroid carcinoma. To test this, they
determined B71 and B72 expression by immunohistochemistry in 27
papillary (PTC; 188550) and 8 follicular (FTC; 188470) thyroid
carcinomas and 9 benign thyroid lesions. B72 expression was of similar
intensity in benign and malignant tumors, but was more intense than in
presumably normal adjacent thyroid. B72 expression also correlated with
the number of tumor-associated lymphocytes per high-power field.
Recurrence developed exclusively from tumors that expressed B72, and
intense B72 expression was associated with a reduced probability of
remission. Shah et al. (2002) concluded that these data support the
hypothesis that the antigen presentation coactivators B71 and B72 may be
important for lymphocytic infiltration and the immune response against
thyroid carcinoma.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Schwartz et al. (2001) reported the crystal structure of the complex
between the disulfide-linked homodimer of human CTLA4 (123890) and the
receptor-binding domain of human B7.2 at 3.2-angstrom resolution.

GENE STRUCTURE

Jellis et al. (1995) isolated the gene for B7-2, which is composed of 8
exons and spans more than 22 kb. The authors found that alternatively
spliced cDNAs result from the use of either exon 1 or 2. Exon 3
corresponds to the signal peptide, exon 4 to an IgV-like domain, exon 5
to an IgC-like domain and exon 6 corresponds to the transmembrane region
and part of the cytoplasmic tail. Exons 7 and 8 encode the remainder of
the tail.

MAPPING

Reeves et al. (1997) demonstrated that the CD86 and CD80 genes are
linked on human chromosome 3 and mouse chromosome 16. Reeves et al.
(1997) used fluorescence in situ hybridization mapping to show that
CD86, like CD80, maps to human 3q21 and mouse chromosome 16, band B5.

;;RNA-BINDING MOTIF PROTEIN 8; RBM8;;
Y14
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The RBM8A gene encodes Y14, 1 of the 4 components of the exon-junction
complex (EJC), which is involved in basic cellular functions such as
nuclear export and subcellular localization of specific transcripts,
translational enhancement, and nonsense-mediated RNA decay (NMD)
(summary by Albers et al., 2012).

CLONING

Mago nashi (MAGOH; 602603), meaning grandchildless, is the homolog of a
Drosophila protein required for normal germ plasm development in fly
embryos. By performing a yeast 2-hybrid screen on a fetal brain cDNA
library with MAGOH as the bait, Zhao et al. (2000) recovered a cDNA
encoding RBM8. The 173-amino acid RBM8 protein is more than 93%
identical to the mouse and zebrafish sequences, and the mouse
differences are all accounted for by an 11-amino acid N-terminal
insertion and another single-residue insertion in the mouse sequence.
Exchange partner and GST pull-down assays confirmed the MAGOH-RBM8
interaction and showed that RBM8 is expressed as a 26-kD protein,
slightly larger than the predicted mass of 23 kD. Northern blot analysis
detected a major RBM8 transcript of less than 1.0 kb in all tissues
tested, with weakest expression in pancreas and brain.

By searching an EST database for homologs of the gonadotropin-releasing
hormone receptor (GNRHR; 138850), followed by 5-prime RACE on a skeletal
muscle cDNA library, Conklin et al. (2000) identified a cDNA encoding
RBM8. Northern blot analysis detected a major 0.9-kb transcript in all
tissues tested. Sequence analysis of the 174-amino acid protein
predicted an RNA-binding domain, which is composed of 2 amphipathic
alpha helices packed against a 4-stranded beta sheet, and a C-terminal
arg-rich segment.

By performing a yeast 2-hybrid screen on a HeLa cell cDNA library to
identify potential cargoes for RAN-binding protein-5 (RANBP5; 602008),
Kataoka et al. (2000) isolated cDNAs encoding RBM8, which they called
Y14. RBM8 encodes a predicted 174-amino acid, predominantly nuclear
nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein.

Salicioni et al. (2000) used a yeast 2-hybrid screen to identify cDNAs
from a human fetal brain cDNA library encoding proteins that interact
with OVCA1 (603527), a candidate tumor suppressor protein. They
identified cDNAs, which they initially referred to as BOV1, that
appeared to encode a new member of the conserved RNA-binding motif
protein family. One of the cDNAs isolated was identical to RBM8A;
another, designated RBM8B, was thought by Salicioni et al. (2000) to be
a novel functional gene, but was later determined to be a pseudogene.
Northern blot analysis revealed that BOV1 is ubiquitously expressed as 3
distinct mRNA species of 1, 3.2, and 5.8 kb.

GENE FUNCTION

Kataoka et al. (2000) found that RBM8 associates preferentially with
mRNAs produced by splicing and not with pre-mRNAs, introns, or mRNAs
produced from intronless cDNAs. RBM8 associates with both nuclear mRNAs
and newly exported cytoplasmic mRNAs. Splicing of a single intron is
sufficient for RBM8 association. RBM8-containing nuclear complexes are
different from general heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP)
complexes in that they contain hnRNP proteins and several unique
proteins, including the mRNA export factor TAP (NXF1; 602647). Thus,
RBM8 defines novel intermediates in the pathway of gene expression,
postsplicing nuclear preexport mRNPs, and newly exported cytoplasmic
mRNPs, whose composition is established by splicing. These findings
suggested that pre-mRNA splicing imprints mRNA with a unique set of
proteins that persists in the cytoplasm and thereby communicates the
history of the transcript.

Kim et al. (2001) analyzed the binding of RBM8A, which they called Y14,
to pre-mRNAs injected into nuclei of Xenopus oocytes. They found that
RBM8A stably bound mRNA sequences approximately -20 nucleotides upstream
of exon-exon junctions.

Oskar mRNA localization at the posterior pole of the Drosophila oocyte
is essential for germline and abdomen formation in the future embryo.
Y14/RBM8 and MAGOH (602603), human homologs of nuclear shuttling
proteins required for oskar mRNA localization, are core components of
the exon-exon junction complex (EJC). The EJC is deposited on mRNAs in a
splicing-dependent manner, 20 to 24 nucleotides upstream of exon-exon
junctions, independent of the RNA sequence. This indicates a possible
role of splicing in oskar mRNA localization, challenging the established
notion that the oskar 3-prime untranslated region is sufficient for this
process. Hachet and Ephrussi (2004) demonstrated that splicing at the
first exon-exon junction of oskar RNA is essential for oskar mRNA
localization at the posterior pole. They revisited the issue of
sufficiency of the oskar 3-prime untranslated region for posterior
localization and showed that the localization of unrelated transcripts
bearing the oskar 3-prime untranslated region is mediated by endogenous
oskar mRNA. Hachet and Ephrussi (2004) concluded that their results
revealed an important new function for splicing: regulation of messenger
ribonucleoprotein complex assembly and organization for mRNA cytoplasmic
localization.

Albers et al. (2012) showed that RBM8A is expressed in all hematopoietic
lineages, and that its encoded protein sequence is highly conserved
between species. Albers et al. (2012) suggested that, given the
important functions of the EJC, it is likely that a complete lack of Y14
in humans is not viable. Indeed, in Drosophila melanogaster, knockdown
of its ortholog tsu leads to major defects in abdomen formation (Hachet
and Ephrussi, 2001), and Albers et al. (2012) found that knockdown of
the orthologous rbm8a transcript in Danio rerio using antisense
morpholinos resulted in extreme malformations and death at 2 days
post-fertilization.

GENE STRUCTURE

Albers et al. (2012) determined that the RBM8A gene comprises 6 exons.

MAPPING

By PCR and radiation hybrid analysis, Zhao et al. (2000) mapped the
RBM8A gene to 1q12. Conklin et al. (2000) mapped the RBM8 gene to
14q21-q23 using radiation hybrid analysis, but it appears that the
sequence on chromosome 14 is a pseudogene.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

It had been shown that an inherited or de novo deletion on chromosome
1q21.1 (Klopocki et al., 2007) is found in the majority of individuals
with TAR syndrome (274000), but the apparent autosomal recessive nature
of that syndrome required the existence of an additional causative
allele. To identify the additional causative allele, Albers et al.
(2012) selected 5 individuals with TAR of European ancestry who had the
1q21.1 deletion and sequenced their exomes, but were unable to find
TAR-associated coding mutations in any gene. However, 4 of the cases
carried the minor allele of a low-frequency SNP in the 5-prime UTR of
the RBM8A gene (dbSNP rs139428292; 605313.0001), while the remaining
case carried a previously unknown SNP in the first intron of the same
gene (605313.0002). Genotyping by Sanger sequencing of another 48 cases
of European ancestry identified the 2 SNPs in 35 and 11 samples,
respectively. In the 25 trios where the deletion in the child was not a
de novo event, Albers et al. (2012) confirmed that the deletion and the
newly identified SNPs were inherited from different parents. The minor
allele frequency of the 5-prime UTR and intronic SNPs were 3.05% and
0.42%, respectively, in 7,504 healthy individuals of the Cambridge
BioResource, and the deletion was absent from 5,919 shared healthy
controls of the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium. There were 2 TAR
cases who did not carry the 1q21.1 deletion but were found to carry the
5-prime UTR SNP. Albers et al. (2012) identified a 4-bp frameshift
insertion at the start of the fourth exon (605313.0003) in the first
case and established that the noncoding SNP and insertion were on
different chromosomes; in the second case, they identified a nonsense
mutation in the last exon of RBM8A (605313.0004). Both mutations were
absent from 458 exome samples of the 1000 Genomes Project and 416
samples from the Cohorte Lausannoise. Albers et al. (2012) concluded
that in the vast majority of cases, compound inheritance of a rare null
allele (containing a deletion, frameshift mutation, or encoded premature
stop codon) and 1 of 2 low-frequency noncoding SNPs in RBM8A causes TAR
syndrome. Albers et al. (2012) showed that the 2 regulatory SNPs result
in diminished RBM8A transcription in vitro and that expression of Y14 is
reduced in platelets from individuals with TAR. Albers et al. (2012)
concluded that their data implicated Y14 insufficiency and, presumably,
an EJC defect as the cause of TAR syndrome.

Given the expression of Y14 in hematopoietic lineages and major defects
observed in Drosophila and zebrafish resulting from knockdown of the
respective Y14 orthologs, Albers et al. (2012) suggested that their
results are compatible with both a dose-effect phenomenon and a
lineage-dependent deficiency in Y14. The possibility of a dose-effect
phenomenon was supported by the observation that simple
haploinsufficiency is not sufficient to create an aberrant phenotype, as
evidenced by the seemingly healthy carriers of the 1q21.1 deletion.
Albers et al. (2012) did not observe an effect on platelet count for
either the 5-prime UTR or the intronic SNP in the 403 and 59 individuals
from the Cambridge BioResource who carried the minor allele for each
SNP, respectively. The authors suggested that compound inheritance of a
null allele together with the minor allele of 1 of the 2 regulatory SNPs
brings Y14 levels below a critical threshold in certain tissues. The
cell line-dependent effect shown in luciferase assays suggested a
combinatorial binding of transcription factors, including EVI1 (165215),
in the context of regulatory SNPs.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
THROMBOCYTOPENIA-ABSENT RADIUS SYNDROME
RBM8A, 5-PRIME UTR, G-A (dbSNP rs139428292)

In 41 of 55 patients with thrombocytopenia-absent radius syndrome (TAR;
274000), Albers et al. (2012) identified the presence of the minor
allele (A) of a G-to-A SNP, dbSNP rs139428292 (chr1:145507646, GRCh37),
in the 5-prime untranslated region (UTR) of the RBM8A gene. In 39 of
these patients this SNP was found in compound heterozygosity with a
200-kb deletion including the RBM8A gene and 10 other genes; in 2
patients the SNP occurred in compound heterozygosity with 1 of 2 null
mutations in the RBM8A gene. The minor allele frequency of the SNP dbSNP
rs139428292 was 3.05% in 7,504 healthy individuals of the Cambridge
BioResource. This SNP resulted in diminished RBM8A transcription in
vitro.

RBM8A, IVS1, G-C

In 12 of 55 patients with thrombocytopenia-absent radius syndrome (TAR;

allele (C) of a SNP in the first intron of the RBM8A gene
(chr1:145507765, GRCh37). The SNP occurred in compound heterozygosity
with a 200-kb deletion including the RBM8A gene and 10 other genes. The
minor allele frequency of this intronic SNP was 0.42% in 7,504 healthy
individuals of the Cambridge BioResource. This SNP resulted in
diminished RBM8A transcription in vitro.

termination mutation in the last exon of the RBM8A gene (C-T,
chr1:145509173, GRCh37) and a SNP in the 5-prime UTR (605313.0001).

;;GNRHR1;;
GRHR;;
LUTEINIZING HORMONE-RELEASING HORMONE RECEPTOR; LHRHR
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GNRH; 152760), a hypothalamic
decapeptide, is a key neuroregulator of the reproductive process. It is
synthesized by hypothalamic neurons, secreted in a pulsatile manner, and
carried to the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland by way of the
hypothalamohypophyseal portal circulation. The primary site of action of
GNRH in the pituitary gland is the gonadotrope, the cell that expresses
GNRH receptors and secretes gonadotropic hormones, which in turn
regulate gametogenic and hormonal functions of the gonads. GNRH receptor
is a member of the G protein-coupled, Ca(2+)-dependent family of
receptors. Located on the cell surface of pituitary gonadotropes, GNRHR
transduces signals from GNRH and modulates the synthesis and secretion
of luteinizing hormone (152780) and follicle-stimulating hormone
(136530).

CLONING

Kakar et al. (1992) isolated a cDNA for the GNRH receptor and showed
that it encodes a protein with a transmembrane topology similar to that
of other G protein-coupled 7-transmembrane-domain receptors.

Grosse et al. (1997) used RT-PCR of human pituitary poly(A)+ RNA to
clone the full-length GNRHR gene and a second truncated cDNA
characterized by a 128-bp deletion between nucleotide positions 522 and
651. The deletion causes a frameshift in the open reading frame, thus
generating new coding sequence for a further 75 amino acids. The
truncated cDNA arises from alternative splicing that uses a cryptic
3-prime splice site in exon 2. Translation products of approximately 45
to 50 and 42 kD were immunoprecipitated from COS-7 cells transfected
with wildtype and truncated GNRHR cDNAs, respectively. The splice
variant was incapable of ligand binding and signal transduction.
Coexpression of wildtype and truncated proteins in transiently or stably
transfected cells, resulted in impaired signaling via the wildtype GNRHR
by reducing maximal agonist-induced inositol phosphate accumulation.
This inhibitory effect depended on the amount of splice variant cDNA
cotransfected and was specific for GNRHR. Coexpression of the wildtype
and truncated GNRHRs resulted in impaired insertion of wildtype GNRHR
into the plasma membrane.

GENE STRUCTURE

Using cDNA probes derived from a human pituitary cDNA library, Fan et
al. (1994) screened a human genomic library and isolated 7 positive
clones. The clones contained the entire protein coding region of the
GNRHR gene, which is distributed among 3 exons and spans over 18.9 kb.
The 2 introns, measuring 4.2 and 5.0 kb, were located within the open
reading frame, indicating that the GNRHR gene is a member of the
intron-containing class of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily.
Genomic Southern blot analysis demonstrated the presence of a single
copy of the gene in the human genome.

Fan et al. (1995) showed that the GNRHR mRNA is approximately 5 kb long,
of which 987 bp comprise the coding region. The gene appears to have
large 5-prime and 3-prime untranslated regions, including, respectively,
multiple transcription initiation sites and polyadenylation signals.

MAPPING

Kaiser et al. (1994) used mapping panels of human/rodent somatic cell
hybrids containing different human chromosomes or different regions of
human chromosome 4 to localize the GNRHR gene to 4q13.1-q21.1.
Furthermore, using linkage analysis of single-strand conformation
polymorphisms, they localized the murine homolog to mouse chromosome 5.
Using PCR analysis of DNA from human/hamster somatic hybrid cell lines,
Fan et al. (1994) assigned the GNRHR gene to chromosome 4. By in situ
hybridization using a biotinylated cDNA probe, Morrison et al. (1994)
localized the GNRHR gene to 4q13.2-q13.3. By fluorescence in situ
hybridization using a larger genomic clone as a probe, Leung et al.
(1995) apparently achieved a more precise localization of the GNRHR gene
to 4q21.2.

Kottler et al. (1995) isolated YAC clones containing the GNRHR gene.
Genetic analysis of the YACs showed that the gene lies between D4S409
and D4S392, which are located 76 and 77 cM, respectively, from the end
of the short arm of chromosome 4. Furthermore, by fluorescence in situ
hybridization, Kottler et al. (1995) demonstrated colocalization of
GNRHR with the KIT gene (164920), which has been mapped to 4q12. Kakar
and Neill (1995) mapped the gene to 4q13 by PCR analysis of genomic DNA
from human/hamster somatic cell hybrids combined with fluorescence in
situ hybridization.

GENE FUNCTION

The growth of sex hormone-dependent tumors is inhibited by analogs of
luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH; 152760). The use of LHRH
agonists for treatment of prostatic and breast cancer is based on
suppression of pituitary-gonadal function and the consequent creation of
a state of sex-steroid deficiency. In addition, LHRH agonists and
antagonists exert a direct effect on these tumors that probably is
mediated by specific high-affinity LHRH receptors found on these cells.
LHRH agonists and antagonists also suppress the growth of experimental
pancreatic cancers. Szende et al. (1991) demonstrated that pancreatic
tumor cells exhibit high-affinity binding sites for LHRH, but only in
their nuclei; low-affinity sites are associated with the cell membranes.
These binding sites appear to be LHRH receptors since electron
microscopic immunohistochemical studies show that an antibody to the
LHRH receptor reacted with sites in the nucleus of pancreatic tumor
cells.

Maji et al. (2009) found that peptide and protein hormones, including
GNRH, in secretory granules of the endocrine system are stored in an
amyloid-like cross-beta-sheet-rich conformation, and concluded that
functional amyloids in the pituitary and other organs can contribute to
normal cell and tissue physiology.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a family in which a brother and sister had idiopathic
hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH7; 146110), de Roux et al. (1997)
demonstrated that the affected individuals were compound heterozygous
for mutations of the GNRHR gene (see 138850.0001). Layman et al. (1998)
also demonstrated compound heterozygosity for 2 missense mutations in
the GNRHR gene in each of 4 affected sibs of a family (see 138850.0003).

Caron et al. (1999) studied a kindred with 3 sibs with isolated
hypogonadotropic hypogonadism who were genetic compounds for the
arg262-to-gln mutation (138850.0002) and an ala129-to-asp (138850.0004)
mutation that resulted in a complete loss of function. The 2 brothers
had microphallus and bilateral cryptorchidism and were referred for lack
of puberty; their sister had primary amenorrhea and a complete lack of
puberty. The authors concluded that these hypogonadal patients were
partially resistant to pulsatile GNRH administration, suggesting that
they should be treated with gonadotropins to induce spermatogenesis or
ovulation rather than with pulsatile GNRH. Kottler et al. (1999)
analyzed in detail the GNRHR mutations in 7 independent familial and
sporadic cases of idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism reported to
that time. The Q106R (138850.0001) and R262Q (138850.0002) mutations
were frequent in patients from all geographic areas (North or South
America or Europe).

To determine the frequency and distribution of GNRHR mutations in a
heterogeneous population of patients with idiopathic hypogonadotropic
hypogonadism, Beranova et al. (2001) screened 108 probands with
idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism for mutations in the coding
sequence of GNRHR. Forty-eight of the 108 patients had a normal sense of
smell, whereas the remaining 60 had anosmia or hyposmia (Kallmann
syndrome). Five unrelated probands (3 men and 2 women), all normosmic,
were documented to have changes in the coding sequence of the GNRHR. Two
of these probands were from a subgroup of 5 kindreds consistent with a
recessive mode of inheritance, establishing a GNRHR mutation frequency
of 2 of 5 (40%) in patients with normosmic, autosomal recessive
idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. The remaining 3 probands with
GNRHR mutations were from a subgroup of 18 patients without evidence of
familial involvement, indicating a prevalence of 3 of 18 (16.7%) in
patients with sporadic idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and a
normal sense of smell. Among the 5 individuals bearing GNRHR mutations,
a broad spectrum of phenotypes was noted, including testicular sizes
that varied from prepubertal to the normal adult male range. Three
probands had compound heterozygous mutations, and 2 had homozygous
mutations. Of the 8 DNA sequence changes identified, 4 were novel. COS-7
cells transiently transfected with cDNAs encoding the human GNRHR
containing each of these 4 novel mutations failed to respond to GNRH
agonist stimulation.

Janovick et al. (2002) showed pharmacologic rescue, assessed by ligand
binding and restoration of receptor coupling to effector, of 5 naturally
occurring GNRHR mutants identified from patients with hypogonadotropic
hypogonadism, as well as rescue of other defective receptors
manufactured with internal or terminal deletions or substitutions at
sites expected to be involved in establishment of tertiary receptor
structure. The pharmacologic agent used was a small, membrane-permeant
molecule, originally designed as an orally active, nonpeptide receptor
antagonist, but is believed to function as a folding template, capable
of correcting the structural defects caused by the mutations and thereby
restoring function. The rescued receptor, stabilized in the plasma
membrane, coupled ligand binding to activation of the appropriate
effector system. For comparison, low-, intermediate-, or high-affinity
peptide antagonists of GNRHR (that do not penetrate the cell) were
unable to effect rescue, as was a nonbinding peptidomimetic congener of
the rescue agent; this latter effect demonstrates specificity of the
rescue agent. Janovick et al. (2002) concluded that mutant GNRHRs
frequently have not lost intrinsic functionality and are subject to
rescue by techniques that enhance membrane expression.

Bedecarrats et al. (2003) analyzed 2 common mutations in GNRHR, gln106
to arg (Q106R; 138850.0001) and arg262 to gln (R262Q; 138850.0002), for
their effects on the stimulation of gonadotropin subunit and GNRHR gene
expression by GNRH. Despite similar impairment of GNRH-stimulated
inositol phosphate production, dose-response analyses indicated that
Q106R and R262Q both reduced the sensitivity of the FSH-beta (136530)
gene promoter to a greater extent than LH-beta (152780) or the
alpha-glycoprotein subunit (alpha-GSU; 118850), suggesting the
involvement of more than one signaling pathway. Furthermore, although
the sensitivities of the LH-beta and FSH-beta gene promoters to GNRH
were similarly affected by both mutants, alpha-GSU sensitivity was
decreased to a greater extent by R262Q than by Q106R. Similarly, GNRHR
gene promoter sensitivity was significantly reduced only by R262Q. The
authors concluded that differential stimulation of LH-beta, FSH-beta,
and alpha-GSU gene expression may contribute to the varied phenotypes
observed among patients harboring these mutations.

Leanos-Miranda et al. (2003) demonstrated that GNRHR mutants inhibited
the function of wildtype GNRHR, measured by activation of effector and
ligand binding. Inhibition varied depending on the particular GNRHR
mutant coexpressed and the ratio of GNRHR mutant to wildtype GNRHR cDNA
cotransfected. The GNRHR mutants did not interfere with the function of
genetically modified GNRHRs bearing either a deletion of
primate-specific lys191 or the carboxyl-terminal tail of catfish GNRHR.
The dominant-negative effect of the naturally occurring receptor mutants
occurred only for the wildtype GNRHR, which has intrinsic low maturation
efficiency. The data suggested that this dominant-negative effect
accompanies the diminished plasma membrane expression as a recent
evolutionary event.

To determine whether genetic variation within either the GNRHR or GNRH1
genes contributes to the regulation of pubertal timing in the general
population, Sedlmeyer et al. (2005) performed sequence analysis and
haplotype-based association studies in individuals with later than
average pubertal development. All observed associations were relatively
modest and only nominally statistically significant. The authors
concluded that genetic variation in GHRH1 and GNRHR is not likely to be
a substantial modulator of pubertal timing in the general population.

In 2 sisters with primary amenorrhea and no breast development at 25 and
18 years of age, respectively (146110), Seminara et al. (2000)
identified compound heterozygosity for Q106R on one allele and R262Q
(138850.0002) on the other. The apparently unaffected parents were
heterozygous for the mutations. Pitteloud et al. (2007) reexamined the
family studied by Seminara et al. (2000) and identified heterozygosity
for an additional missense mutation in the FGFR1 gene (136350.0016) in
the 2 sisters and in their father, who had a history of delayed puberty.
Mutation analysis of the children of the younger sister revealed that
her unaffected daughter, who had undergone normal puberty, was
heterozygous for the mutation in FGFR1 but had no mutations in the GNRHR
gene, and that her prepubertal 10-year-old twin sons, born without
cryptorchidism or microphallus, were each heterozygous for 1 of the
mutations in GNRHR but did not have any mutations in the FGFR1 gene.
Pitteloud et al. (2007) concluded that defects in 2 different genes can
synergize to produce a more severe phenotype in families with
hypogonadotropic hypogonadism than either alone, and that this digenic
model may account for some of the phenotypic heterogeneity seen in GnRH
deficiency.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM 7 WITHOUT ANOSMIA
FERTILE EUNUCH SYNDROME, INCLUDED
GNRHR, GLN106ARG

In a sibship in which a brother and sister had hypogonadotropic
hypogonadism (HH7; 146110), de Roux et al. (1997) found that the
affected persons were compound heterozygotes for a gln106-to-arg (Q106R)
mutation and an arg262-to-gln (R262Q) mutation (138850.0002) in the GNRH
receptor. The propositus was a 22-year-old man who was referred because
of hypogonadism. Puberty had occurred at the age of 16. His height was
180 cm and his arm span 186 cm. He reported impaired libido. Physical
examination revealed absence of facial hair, sparse pubic hair (Tanner
stage 3), and a penis of 6 cm. He had scrotal testes, and the volume of
each was 8 ml (normal, 15 to 25 ml). There was no gynecomastia. He had a
normal sense of smell and no mirror movements of the upper limbs, no
abnormal eye movements, no colorblindness, and no renal or craniofacial
abnormalities. The karyotype was 46,XY. The patient's older sister was a
37-year-old woman with a history of primary amenorrhea and infertility.
Spontaneous thelarche had occurred at the age of 14 years. She had a
single episode of uterine bleeding at the age of 18, and afterward
received combined oral contraceptive treatment. This treatment was
interrupted when she desired children. However, amenorrhea and absence
of pregnancy led to ovulation-inducing treatment, which resulted in 2
normal pregnancies and the births of a girl and a boy, 4 and 7 years old
at the time of report. After each pregnancy, she had persistent
amenorrhea, and oral contraceptive treatment was resumed. Her height was
165 cm. Pubic hair development was at Tanner stage 5, and her breasts
and external genitalia were those of a normal woman. Both parents and a
sister who was found to be heterozygous for 1 of the 2 mutations were
clinically and endocrinologically normal. A G-to-A transition at
nucleotide 317 was responsible for the gln106-to-arg mutation in the
first extracellular loop of the receptor.

De Roux et al. (1999) found this mutation in compound heterozygosity
with S217R (138850.0005) on the same allele and R262Q (138850.0002) on
the other allele.

In 2 sisters with primary amenorrhea and no breast development at 25 and
18 years of age, respectively, Seminara et al. (2000) identified
compound heterozygosity for Q106R on one allele and R262Q (138850.0002)
on the other. The apparently unaffected parents were heterozygous for
the mutations. Pitteloud et al. (2007) reexamined this family and
identified heterozygosity for an additional missense mutation in the
FGFR1 gene (136350.0016) in the 2 sisters and in their father, who had a
history of delayed puberty. Mutation analysis of the children of the
younger sister revealed that her unaffected daughter, who underwent
normal puberty, was heterozygous for the mutation in FGFR1 but had no
mutations in the GNRHR gene, and that her prepubertal 10-year-old twin
sons, born without cryptorchidism or microphallus, were each
heterozygous for 1 of the mutations in the GNRHR gene but did not have
any mutations in the FGFR1 gene. Pitteloud et al. (2007) concluded that
defects in 2 different genes can synergize to produce a more severe
phenotype in families with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism than either
alone, and that this digenic model may account for some of the
phenotypic heterogeneity seen in GnRH deficiency.

Pitteloud et al. (2001) described a 26-year-old male with a mild
phenotypic form of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, the fertile eunuch
syndrome (228300) (hypogonadotropic hypogonadism in the presence of
normal testicular size and some degree of spermatogenesis), associated
with a homozygous gln106-to-arg GNRHR mutation. De Roux et al. (1997)
had shown that this mutation, located in the first extracellular loop of
the GNRHR, decreases but does not eliminate GNRH binding. The proband
had hypogonadal testosterone levels, detectable but apulsatile
gonadotropin secretion, and a normal adult male testicular size of 17 mL
at baseline. After only 4 months of treatment with CG (see 118860)
alone, he developed sperm in his ejaculate and his wife conceived.
Following cessation of CG therapy, the patient demonstrated reversal of
his hypogonadotropism as evidenced by normal adult male testosterone
levels and the appearance of pulsatile luteinizing hormone (see 152780)
secretion. The authors concluded that this case expands the clinical
spectrum of GNRHR mutations, provides the first genetic basis for the
fertile eunuch variant of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, and documents
the occurrence of reversible hypogonadotropic hypogonadism in a patient
with a GNRHR mutation.

Costa et al. (2001) found this mutation in compound heterozygosity with
asn10 to lys (138850.0009). In vitro analysis indicated that the Q106R
mutation, located in the first extracellular loop, was able to bind
GNRH, but with a reduced affinity.

.0002
HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM 7 WITHOUT ANOSMIA
GNRHR, ARG262GLN

See 138850.0001 and de Roux et al. (1997). A G-to-A transition at
nucleotide 785 yielded the arg262-to-gln (R262Q) mutation in the third
intracellular loop of the GNRH receptor. Caron et al. (1999) detected
the R262Q mutation in compound heterozygosity with an A129D mutation
(138850.0004) in 3 sibs.

De Roux et al. (1999) found this mutation in compound heterozygosity
with Q106R (138850.0001) and S217R (138850.0005) on the other allele.

See 138850.0001 and Seminara et al. (2000).

Lin et al. (2006) reported a homozygous R262Q mutation in the GNRH
receptor in 2 brothers with IHH (HH7; 146110). The proband presented at
15 years of age with delayed puberty. After a short course of
testosterone, he seemed to be progressing through puberty appropriately
and was discharged from follow-up. His younger brother was also referred
with delayed puberty but showed little progress after treatment. Lin et
al. (2006) concluded that homozygous partial loss-of-function mutations
in the GNRHR such as R262Q can present with variable phenotypes,
including apparent delayed puberty.

.0003
HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM 7 WITHOUT ANOSMIA
GNRHR, TYR284CYS

In a screening of 46 unrelated patients with idiopathic hypogonadotropic
hypogonadism (32 males at least 18 years of age and 14 females at least
17 years of age) without anosmia (HH7; 146110), using denaturing
gradient gel electrophoresis of GC-clamped PCR products, Layman et al.
(1998) found 2 missense mutations in affected members of 1 family. One
was a CGG-to-CAG (arg262 to gln; R262Q) mutation in intracellular loop 3
(138850.0002); the other was a TAT-to-TGT (tyr284 to cys; Y284C)
mutation in transmembrane region 6. All 4 affected sibs were compound
heterozygotes for these mutations, whereas an unaffected sib and all 75
unrelated controls were normal. At least 1 of the affected females
ovulated with exogenous gonadotropins. The 2 GNRHR mutations had minimal
effects upon receptor affinity, but receptor expression was decreased
for both.

.0004
HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM 7 WITHOUT ANOSMIA
GNRHR, ALA129ASP

Caron et al. (1999) found that 3 sibs with isolated hypogonadotropic
hypogonadism (HH7; 146110) were compound heterozygotes for mutations in
the GNRHR gene. One mutation was a change of amino acid 129 from alanine
to aspartic acid (A129D), and the other was a replacement of arginine by
glutamine at amino acid 262 (R262Q; 138850.0002). The A129D change was
caused by a C-to-A transversion at nucleotide position 386. The father
was heterozygous for the R262Q mutation, the mother for the A129D
mutation.

.0005
HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM 7 WITH ANOSMIA
GNRHR, SER217ARG

De Roux et al. (1999) performed detailed endocrinologic studies in 3
affected members of a family with IHH (HH7; 146110) who had GNRHR
mutations. All 3 were compound heterozygotes for an arg262-to-gln
(R262Q; 138850.0002) substitution on one allele and gln106-to-arg
(Q106R; 138850.0001) and ser217-to-arg (S217R) substitutions on the
other. When expressed in heterologous cells, both the Q106R and S217R
mutations altered hormone binding, whereas the R262Q mutation altered
activation of phospholipase C (see 600810). The proband, a 30-year-old
male, had complete hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (146110) with extremely
low plasma levels of gonadotropins, absence of pulsatility of endogenous
LH and alpha subunit (see 152780), absence of response to GNRH (152760)
and GNRH agonist (triptorelin), and absence of effect of pulsatile
administration of GNRH. His affected 18- and 24-year-old sisters had
only partial hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. They both had primary
amenorrhea and normal breast development, but the younger sister had
retarded bone maturation and uterus development. Gonadotropin
concentrations were normal or low, but in both cases were restored to
normal levels by a single injection of GNRH. In both sisters, there were
no spontaneous pulses of LH, but pulsatile administration of GNRH
provoked pulsatile secretion of LH in the younger one. The authors
concluded that the same GNRHR mutations may exhibit varying degrees of
alteration of gonadotropin function in affected members of the same
family.

.0006
HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM 7 WITHOUT ANOSMIA
GNRHR, SER168ARG

Pralong et al. (1999) described a male patient with complete
hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH7; 146110) who presented primary
failure of pulsatile GNRH (152760) therapy, but responded to exogenous
gonadotropin administration. The patient had a T-to-A transversion at
codon 168 of the gene encoding the GNRH receptor (GNRHR), resulting in a
ser168-to-arg (S168R) change in the fourth transmembrane domain of
GNRHR. This mutation was present in homozygous state in the patient,
whereas it was in heterozygous state in both phenotypically normal
parents. When introduced into GNRHR cDNA, S168R resulted in complete
loss of the receptor-mediated signaling response to GNRH.

.0007
HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM 7 WITHOUT ANOSMIA
GNRHR, LEU314TER

Kottler et al. (2000) described a woman with complete hypogonadotropic
hypogonadism (HH7; 146110) and a new compound heterozygous mutation of
the GNRHR gene. A null mutation L314X leading to a partial deletion of
the seventh transmembrane domain of GNRHR was associated with the Q106R
mutation (138850.0001). The L314X mutant receptor showed neither
measurable binding nor inositol phosphate production when transfected in
CHO-K1 cells compared to the wildtype receptor. The disease was
transmitted by an autosomal recessive mode, and heterozygous individuals
with GNRHR mutations had normal pubertal development and fertility.

.0008
HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM 7 WITHOUT ANOSMIA
GNRHR, ARG139HIS

Costa et al. (2001) investigated 17 Brazilian patients (10 males and 7
females) from 14 different families with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism
and normal olfaction (HH7; 146110). The diagnosis of hypogonadotropic
hypogonadism was based on absent or incomplete sexual development after
17 years of age associated with low or normal levels of LH (152780) in
both sexes and low levels of testosterone in males and of estradiol in
females. All patients presented with a normal sense of smell in an
olfactory-specific test. In 1 female with complete hypogonadotropic
hypogonadism, Costa et al. (2001) identified an arg139-to-his mutation
(R139H), located in the conserved DRS motif at the junction of the third
transmembrane and the second intracellular loop of the GNRHR, in the
homozygous state. The R139H mutation completely eliminated detectable
GNRH-binding activity and prevented GNRH-induced stimulation of inositol
phosphate accumulation in vitro. The patient had undetectable serum
basal LH and FSH levels that failed to respond to GNRH stimulation.

.0009
HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM 7 WITHOUT ANOSMIA
GNRHR, ASN10LYS

In 4 sibs (2 males and 2 females) with partial hypogonadotropic
hypogonadism (HH7; 146110), Costa et al. (2001) identified a novel
compound heterozygous mutation, asn10-to-lys (N10K) and gln106-to-arg
(Q106R; 138850.0001). The Q106R mutation binds GNRH with a reduced
affinity; the N10K mutation, in the extracellular amino-terminal domain
of the receptor, also reduces the affinity for GNRH in vitro. Affected
patients with the N10K/Q106R mutations had partial hypogonadotropic
hypogonadism with low serum basal LH levels that were responsive to GNRH
stimulation.

.0010
HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM 7 WITHOUT ANOSMIA
GNRHR, GLU90LYS

In 2 sibs with the complete form of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH7;
146110), Soderlund et al. (2001) detected a novel homozygous G-to-A
transition at nucleotide 268 of the GNRHR gene, which resulted in a
glu90-to-lys (E90K) amino acid substitution. This mutation is located in
the second transmembrane domain of the GNRH receptor. To assess the
functional role of E90, Maya-Nunez et al. (2002) performed mutation
analysis of the E90K substitution. Transient expression of the mutant
receptor in COS-7 cells resulted in a virtual abolition of GNRH agonist
binding and agonist-stimulated phosphoinositide turnover, initially
suggesting that E90 may be essential for GNRH binding. To examine the
role of a site known to suppress GNRHR function, mutants with deletion
of K191 from the GNRHR and/or addition of catfish Gnrhr intracellular
C-terminal tail to GNRHR were prepared. Activation of intracellular
signaling in response to buserelin was restored by deletion of K191 from
the E90K mutant receptor but minimally by addition of the catfish GNRHR
C-terminal tail. This study provided evidence that the E90K mutation
impairs GNRHR-effector coupling. Maya-Nunez et al. (2002) concluded that
the observation that sequence modifications that enhance surface
expression of the receptor restore function presents the possibility
that loss of surface expression may underlie the severe phenotype
exhibited by hypogonadotropic hypogonadism patients bearing this
mutation.

.0011
HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM 7 WITHOUT ANOSMIA
GNRHR, IVS1, G-A, -1

Silveira et al. (2002) reported a woman with complete GNRH resistance
(HH7; 146110) secondary to a novel homozygous GNRHR gene mutation,
transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait. She presented with primary
amenorrhea and absent thelarche and pubarche. Dynamic tests demonstrated
absent spontaneous gonadotropin pulsatility, and no response to either
exogenous pulsatile or acute GNRH administration. However, she responded
to exogenous gonadotropin administration with a resulting normal
pregnancy. Analysis of genomic DNA revealed a homozygous splice junction
mutation, a G-to-A transition at the intron 1-exon 2 boundary. Her
unaffected sister was heterozygous for this mutation. Results of RT-PCR
analysis of RNA showed a transcript lacking all of exon 2, with splicing
of exon 1 to exon 3. This created a frameshift, generating a coding
sequence for 3 new amino acids followed by a stop codon. Although it is
not clear whether the mutant receptor was actually expressed, the
resultant mRNA sequence was presumed to produce a truncated receptor
with no binding or signaling capacity.

.0012
HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM 7 WITHOUT ANOSMIA
GNRHR, ALA171THR

In 2 brothers with severe hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH7; 146110),
Karges et al. (2003) found a G-to-A transition at nucleotide 511 of the
LHCGR gene that resulted in an ala171-to-thr (A171T) substitution at
transmembrane helix 4 (TMH4). After in vitro expression in human
embryonic kidney 293T cells, the A171T mutant LHCGR exhibited a lack of
phospholipase C activity in signal transduction. Specific receptor
binding of radioisotope-labeled GNRH ligand was undetectable in
transfected cells. Molecular modeling and dynamic simulation of the
mutant receptor suggested the introduction of a stable hydrogen bond
that impeded conformational mobility of the TMH3 and TMH4 domains
required for sequential ligand binding and receptor activation, thus
stabilizing the LHCGR in its inactive conformation.

.0013
HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM 7 WITHOUT ANOSMIA
GNRHR, ASN10LYS AND GLN11LYS

Meysing et al. (2004) reported a normosmic female subject with
congenital idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH7; 146110) in
whom treatment with pulsatile GNRH resulted in an unusual response. The
subject not only required an increased dose of pulsatile GNRH for
ovarian follicular development, but LH secretion did not increase
appropriately, estradiol levels remained low, and she did not ovulate
spontaneously. Sequencing of the GNRHR coding sequence revealed compound
heterozygosity for a 30T-A transversion in exon 1 of the GNRHR gene,
resulting in a 2-amino acid substitution on one allele (N10K+Q11K), and
a missense mutation on the other allele (P320L; 138850.0014).
Introduction of the P320L mutation into the GNRH receptor led to failure
of detectable ligand binding and failure of stimulation of inositol
phosphate production and gonadotropin subunit gene promoter activity in
response to GnRH in transiently transfected cells. Introduction of the
N10K+Q11K mutation into the GNRH receptor resulted in reduced binding of
a GNRH agonist to 25% of the wildtype receptor. In addition, the EC50
value for GNRH stimulation of inositol phosphate production was
significantly increased, and the dose-response curves for stimulation of
alpha-gonadotropin subunit (118850), LH-beta (152780), and FSH-beta
(136530) gene transcription by GNRH were similarly shifted to the right.
The authors proposed that these GNRHR mutations result in a rightward
shift of the dose-response curves of gonadotropin responses to pulsatile
GNRH in the subject and unmask the differential sensitivities of LH and
FSH to GNRH, resulting in low LH and estradiol levels despite
appropriate FSH secretion and follicular growth.

GNRHR, PRO320LEU

The patient with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH7; 146110) reported by
Meysing et al. (2004) was a compound heterozygote for a 2-amino acid
substitution on one allele of the GNRHR gene (138850.0013) and a 959C-T
transition in exon 3 on the other that resulted in a pro320-to-leu
substitution (P320L).

603083	TITLE *603083 HETEROGENEOUS NUCLEAR RIBOPROTEIN L; HNRNPL
;;HNRPL
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) complexes contain hnRNAs
and their associated proteins and are directly involved in mRNA
synthesis and maturation. hnRNP complexes contain more than 20 major
proteins, including the group A, B, and C core proteins and a more
heterogeneous population of larger polypeptides, such as HNRNPL
(Pinol-Roma et al., 1989).

CLONING

Pinol-Roma et al. (1989) noted that among the major polypeptides
associated with hnRNA in HeLa cells is a set of 2 distinct,
approximately 68-kD proteins, designated HNRPL and HNRPM (HNRPNM;
160994). By UV crosslinking proteins to RNA and by sedimentation
analysis before and after RNase digestion, Pinol-Roma et al. (1989)
demonstrated with a monoclonal antibody against HNRPL that HNRPL is
stably associated with hnRNP complexes. They also showed that HNRPL is
present in the nucleoplasm, in 1 to 3 unidentified discrete nonnucleolar
structures, and outside hnRNP complexes. The authors detected HNRPL in
various vertebrates and found that HNRPL is associated with most nascent
transcripts on the lampbrush chromosomes of the newt N. viridescens.
Pinol-Roma et al. (1989) screened a HeLa cell cDNA expression library
with serum containing antibodies against hnRNPs and isolated a cDNA
encoding HNRPL. Northern blot analysis detected an approximately 2.3-kb
HNRPL transcript in HeLa cells. The predicted 558-amino acid protein is
glycine- and proline-rich and has a calculated molecular weight of
60,187 Da. HNRPL contains 2 segments of approximately 80 amino acids
each that are weakly related to each other and to the ribonucleoprotein
consensus sequence-type RNA-binding domains of other hnRNP and snRNP
proteins.

GENE FUNCTION

Translational repression of glucose transporter-1 (GLUT1, or SLC2A1;
138140) in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM; 137800) is mediated by a
specific RNA-binding protein that interacts with an AU-rich response
element in the 3-prime UTR of the GLUT1 transcript. Hamilton et al.
(1999) showed that HNRNPA2 (600124) and HNRNPL bound the 3-prime UTR of
GLUT1 mRNA. Induction of brain ischemia in rats or hypoglycemic stress
in 293 cells increased GLUT1 expression via mRNA stability. Polysomes
isolated from ischemic rat brains or hypoglycemic 293 cells showed loss
of HNRNPA2 and HNRNPL, suggesting that reduced levels of these
RNA-binding proteins results in GLUT1 mRNA stability.
Immunoprecipitation of polysomes from activated human T lymphocytes
suggested that HNRNPA2 and HNRNPL form a complex in vivo.

Ray et al. (2009) reported an RNA switch in the human VEGFA (192240)
mRNA 3-prime untranslated region (UTR) that integrates signals from
IFN-gamma (107570) and hypoxia to regulate VEGFA translation in myeloid
cells. Analogous to riboswitches, the VEGFA 3-prime UTR undergoes a
binary conformational change in response to environmental signals.
However, the VEGFA 3-prime UTR switch is metabolite-independent, and the
conformational change is dictated by mutually exclusive,
stimulus-dependent binding of proteins, namely, the IFN-gamma-activated
inhibitor of translation complex and HNRNPL. Ray et al. (2009)
speculated that the VEGFA switch represents the founding member of a
family of signal-mediated, protein-dependent RNA switches that evolved
to regulate gene expression in multicellular animals in which the
precise integration of disparate inputs may be more important than the
rapidity of response.
