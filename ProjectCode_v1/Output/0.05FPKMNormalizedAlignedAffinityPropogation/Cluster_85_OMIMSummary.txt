KERATIN, HARD, TYPE I, 6; HA6
DESCRIPTION See KRTHA1 (601077) for general information on hair keratins.

Rogers et al. (1998) and Langbein et al. (1999) reported the
identification of the KRTHA6 gene, which they called HA6. Rogers et al.
(1998) found that the deduced KRTHA6 protein has 468 amino acids. They
stated that KRTHA6 is probably identical to the minor type I hair
keratin HAX (Heid et al., 1988). The KRTHA6 gene contains 7 exons. By
RT-PCR, Rogers et al. (1998) showed that KRTHA6 is expressed in the
human hair follicle. See Langbein et al. (1999) for further details on
the expression pattern of the KRTHA6 gene in the hair follicle.

Rogers et al. (1998) isolated and characterized 2 overlapping human PAC
clones that cover 190 kb on 17q12-q21 and contain 9 type I hair keratin
genes, 1 transcribed hair keratin pseudogene, and 1 orphan exon. The
order of the genes is 5-prime--KRTHA6--KRTHA5 (602764)--KRTHA2
(602760)--orphan exon--KRTHA8 (604542)--KRTHA7
(604541)--pseudogene--KRTHA1--KRTHA4 (602763)--KRTHA3B (602762)--KRTHA3A
(602761)--3-prime. The hair keratin genes range in size from 4.2 to 7.5
kb, and the genes are separated from each other by 5.5 to 18.4 kb; all
are located within about 140 kb. Each gene is transcribed from the
5-prime to 3-prime direction. Based on sequence homologies, the genes
can be grouped into 3 subclusters of tandemly arranged genes. One
subcluster, group A, consists of KRTHA1, KRTHA3A, KRTHA3B, and KRTHA4,
which share 89% overall amino acid identity. A second subcluster, group
B, contains KRTHA7 and KRTHA8, as well as the hair keratin pseudogene,
which the authors called HAA. The functional hair keratins and
hypothetical HAA hair keratin share approximately 81% overall amino acid
identity. The third subcluster, group C, consists of the structurally
less related hair keratins KRTHA2, KRTHA5, and KRTHA6, which share about
70% amino acid identity.

107830	TITLE *107830 ARGINASE II; ARG2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Spector et al. (1980) presented evidence for the existence of 2
arginases. The one found in liver and red cells (ARG1; 608313) is
severely deficient in argininemia (207800). In patients with this
disorder, some urea is produced, presumably because the arginase of
kidney, brain, and gastrointestinal tract is less affected; 'liver-type'
enzyme constitutes only about half the enzyme in these tissues. In
argininemia, kidney enzyme is about 3 times normal. Spector et al.
(1980, 1983) demonstrated immunologic differences between liver and
kidney enzymes by means of rabbit anti-human liver arginase. In addition
to the immunologic differences and differences in tissue location, the
second enzyme differs in electrophoretic mobility in polyacrylamide
gels, in its quantitatively different requirement for divalent manganese
activation, and in its differential inhibition by proline and
isoleucine; it is localized to the mitochondrial matrix, whereas
arginase I is cytoplasmic.

Vockley et al. (1996) found several EST database sequences with 40 to
60% homology to ARG1 and used these sequences to clone the human ARG2
gene from a Jurkat cDNA library. The ARG2 gene encodes a 355-amino acid
polypeptide. Comparing the amino acid sequences of ARG1 and ARG2,
Vockley et al. (1996) noted 6 short regions of 92% identity in conserved
regions and about 42% identity throughout the remainder of the
sequences. Using Northern blotting and RT-PCR, Vockley et al. (1996)
found that ARG2 is expressed as a 1.5-kb mRNA in a wide variety of
tissues, with highest levels of expression in prostate, brain, and
kidney. The authors also observed 2 other transcripts of 2.0 and 4.0 kb
expressed in prostate tissue. Gotoh et al. (1996) cloned the human ARG2
gene. They noted that it contained a mitochondrial import sequence, and
showed that in transfected COS-7 cells the protein is imported into the
mitochondria with appropriate proteolysis.

Morris et al. (1997) found that the predicted sequence of human type II
arginase is 58% identical to the sequence of human type I arginase but
is 71% identical to the sequence of Xenopus type II arginase, suggesting
that duplication of the arginase gene occurred before mammals and
amphibians diverged. Seven residues known to be essential for activity
are conserved in all arginases. Type II arginase mRNA was detected in
virtually all human and mouse RNA samples tested, whereas type I
arginase mRNA was found only in liver. Morris et al. (1997) speculated
that multiple type II arginase mRNAs in humans may arise from
differential RNA processing or usage of alternative promoters.

GENE FUNCTION

Vockley et al. (1996) stated that ARG2 may be inducible and may be
essential in the regulation of nitric oxide synthesis by modulating
local arginine concentrations. Gotoh et al. (1996) showed that ARG2 mRNA
and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) mRNA were coinduced by
lipopolysaccharide in a macrophage-like cell line. This coinduction was
enhanced by dexamethasone and dibutyryl cAMP, and was prevented by
interferon-gamma (147570).

In a review and discussion of the human arginases and arginase
deficiency, Iyer et al. (1998) provided a brief history leading up to
the cloning of the ARG2 gene. They pointed out that the mitochondrial
location of ARG2 and its coinduction with ornithine aminotransferase
(613349) and involvement with proline biosynthesis in lactating rat
mammary gland had led to the inference that ARG2 is involved in
biosynthetic functions, as opposed to the metabolic ones of the urea
cycle. The many metabolic fates of arginine and its immediate product
ornithine were diagrammed in their Figure 4. They presented evidence for
the role of ARG2 in nitric oxide and polyamine metabolism.

MAPPING

By PCR analysis of somatic cell hybrid panels, fluorescence in situ
hybridization, and radiation hybrid analysis, Gotoh et al. (1997) mapped
the ARG2 gene to 14q24.1-q24.3.

ANIMAL MODEL

Deignan et al. (2006) created mice with individual and combined knockout
of Arg1 and Arg2. Arg1 knockout animals died by 14 days of age from
hyperammonemia, while Arg2 knockout mice had no obvious phenotype. The
double Arg1/Arg2 knockout mice exhibited the phenotype of the
Arg1-knockout mice, with the additional absence of Arg2 not exacerbating
the phenotype. Plasma amino acid measurements in the double knockout
mice showed arginine levels increased roughly 100-fold and ornithine
decreased roughly 10-fold compared with wildtype. Arginine and ornithine
levels were also altered in liver, kidney, brain, and small intestine in
the double knockout mice.

605918	TITLE *605918 SPONDIN 2; SPON2
;;MINDIN;;
M-SPONDIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a differential display technique, Manda et al. (1999) isolated 2
novel cDNAs, SPON2 and C20ORF1 (605917), which they designated
differentially expressed in cancerous and noncancerous lung cells-1
(DIL1) and -2 (DIL2), respectively. The full-length SPON2 cDNA encodes a
331-amino acid protein with a domain organization similar to those of
zebrafish mindin-1/mindin-2 and F-spondin (SPON1; 604989): a hydrophobic
signal sequence in the N terminus, an FS1 domain, an FS2 domain, and a
thrombospondin type I repeat. RT-PCR analysis detected no expression of
SPON2 in lung carcinoma cells. Northern blot analysis detected
expression of a 1.9-kb SPON2 transcript in various tissues, including
adult and fetal lung.

He et al. (2004) cloned mouse Spon2, which they termed mindin. The mouse
mindin protein, which is 85% identical to the human protein, is a
conserved member of a family of secreted extracellular matrix proteins.
RNA blot analysis detected expression in a variety of tissues, with
abundant expression in lung and lymphoid tissues. Immunoblot blot
analysis showed expression of a 42-kD protein under reducing conditions
and expression of dimers and oligomers in a concentration-dependent
manner under nonreducing conditions.

GENE STRUCTURE

He et al. (2004) determined that the mouse Spon2 gene contains 6 exons
spanning 5 kb.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the SPON2
gene to chromosome 4p16.3 (TMAP WI-22263).

ANIMAL MODEL

By targeted replacement of part of exon 1 and all of exons 2 and 3 of
the Spon2 gene, He et al. (2004) generated Spon2-deficient mice. These
mice had a normal appearance and life span under pathogen-free
conditions. Spon2-deficient mice were resistant to lipopolysaccharide
(LPS)-induced shock, and their macrophages only produced slightly
elevated inflammatory cytokines. Addition of Spon2 to Spon2-deficient,
but not Tlr4 (603030)-deficient, macrophages restored their ability to
produce inflammatory cytokines in response to LPS. Stimuli from most
gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and yeast also failed to induce
cytokine responses from Spon2-deficient macrophages and mast cells.
Spon2-deficient mice showed variable clearance of pathogens when
inoculated by the pulmonary and intraperitoneal routes. Fluorescence
microscopy demonstrated Spon2-dependent bacterial agglutination in the
presence of calcium due to a specific interaction with the carbohydrate
moiety of LPS and lipoteichoic acid. Phagocytosis experiments indicated
that Spon2 acts as an opsonin and pattern-recognition molecule for a
range of pathogens. He et al. (2004) proposed that Spon2 recognition of
carbohydrate structures is essential for the activation of macrophages
by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs).

608757	TITLE *608757 CLP1, YEAST, HOMOLOG OF; CLP1
;;HEAB
HEAB/AF10 FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By cloning and sequencing a complex rearrangement involving chromosomes
10 and 11, Tanabe et al. (1996) obtained a partial genomic clone of
HEAB. By 5-prime and 3-prime RACE of several cDNA libraries, they
obtained a full-length cDNA. The 3-prime UTR contains 2 putative
polyadenylation sites. The deduced 425-amino acid protein is valine- and
leucine-rich and contains a domain sharing similarity with the
ATP/GTP-binding domain of ABC transporters. It also has a possible
tyrosine kinase phosphorylation site. Northern blot analysis detected a
major 2.0-kb transcript that was expressed ubiquitously, with highest
expression in testis and skeletal muscle. A 3.2-kb transcript was less
abundant in many tissues, with highest expression in peripheral blood
leukocytes and thymus.

De Vries et al. (2000) purified pre-mRNA cleavage factor IIm (CFIIm) of
the 3-prime end processing complex (see 604978) from HeLa cell nuclear
extracts and determined that it contains PCF11 (608876) and CLP1. By
searching databases and PCR of a HeLa cell cDNA library, they cloned
CLP1. The deduced protein contains highly conserved Walker A and B
motifs, which have been implicated in ATP/GTP binding.

GENE FUNCTION

De Vries et al. (2000) found that immunodepletion of CLP1 reduced
pre-mRNA cleavage activity, but not polyadenylation activity, in
purified HeLa cell CFIIm. CLP1 interacted with CFIm and
cleavage-polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF; see 606027),
suggesting that it bridges these two 3-prime end processing factors
within the cleavage complex.

Paushkin et al. (2004) identified and characterized the human tRNA
splicing endonuclease (see SEN2; 608753). They found that human
endonuclease complexes are associated with pre-mRNA 3-prime end
processing factors, including CLP1. Small interfering RNA-mediated
depletion of SEN2 led to defects in maturation of both pre-tRNA and
pre-mRNA. These findings demonstrated a link between pre-tRNA splicing
and pre-mRNA 3-prime end formation, suggesting that the endonuclease
subunits function in multiple RNA processing events.

Weitzer and Martinez (2007) applied a chromatographic approach that
resulted in the identification of the human protein CLP1, a component of
both tRNA splicing and mRNA 3-prime-end formation machineries, as the
RNA kinase responsible for phosphorylation of the 5-prime end of siRNAs
necessary for their subsequent incorporation into the RISC complex
(RNA-induced silencing complex). Weitzer and Martinez (2007) reported
that the kinase CLP1 phosphorylates and licenses synthetic siRNAs to
become assembled into RISC for subsequent target RNA cleavage. More
importantly, Weitzer and Martinez (2007) demonstrated that the
physiologic role of CLP1 as the RNA kinase that phosphorylates the
5-prime end of the 3-prime exon during human tRNA splicing, allowing the
subsequent ligation of both exon halves by an unknown tRNA ligase.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid analysis and FISH, Tanabe et al. (1996) mapped
the CLP1 gene to chromosome 11p12.

CYTOGENETICS

Tanabe et al. (1996) identified an invins(10;11)(p12;q23q12) and other
complex chromosomal rearrangements in a 2-year old boy with acute
monoblastic leukemia (AML-M5). Cloning of the proximal 10p breakpoint
showed that the MLL gene (159555) at chromosome 11q23 was fused to the
3-prime portion of AF10 (MLLT10; 602409) at chromosome 10p12. Cloning of
the telomeric 10p junction revealed that the 5-prime portion of AF10 was
fused with the HEAB gene. The 5-prime AF10/HEAB fusion transcript was
out of frame.

ANIMAL MODEL

Hanada et al. (2013) generated kinase-dead Clp1 mice that showed a
progressive loss of spinal motor neurons associated with axonal
degeneration in the peripheral nerves and denervation of neuromuscular
junctions, resulting in impaired motor function, muscle weakness,
paralysis, and fatal respiratory failure. Transgenic rescue experiments
showed that Clp1 functions in motor neurons. Mechanistically, loss of
Clp1 activity results in accumulation of a novel set of small RNA
fragments, derived from aberrant processing of tyrosine pre-transfer
RNA. These tRNA fragments sensitize cells to oxidative stress-induced
p53 (191170) activation and p53-dependent cell death. Genetic
inactivation of p53 rescues Clp1 kinase-dead mice from the motor neuron
loss, muscle denervation, and respiratory failure. Hanada et al. (2013)
concluded that their experiments uncovered a mechanistic link between
tRNA processing, formation of a new RNA species, and progressive loss of
lower motor neurons regulated by p53.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS; 194050) is a multisystem developmental
disorder caused by the deletion of contiguous genes at chromosome
7q11.23. A common interval that includes as many as 17 genes is deleted
in most patients. Meng et al. (1998) constructed a physical map
encompassing the 1.5-Mb region that is commonly deleted in WBS. They
identified 3 genes within this region, including WBSCR14, which they
designated WS-bHLH. By EST database searching, sequencing, and screening
of a human fetal brain cDNA library, they isolated a partial WBSCR14
cDNA encoding a protein belonging to the basic helix-loop-helix
leucine-zipper family of transcription factors.

De Luis et al. (2000) fully characterized the WBSCR14 gene. They
identified 2 intragenic polymorphic dinucleotide repeats and used them
to verify hemizygosity in WBS patients. They found that the WBSCR14 cDNA
encodes an 852-amino acid protein which, in addition to the bHLH-ZIP
motif, has a bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS). Northern blot
analysis detected a 4.2-kb transcript predominantly in adult liver and
at late stages of fetal development. De Luis et al. (2000) also cloned
the mouse homolog. Given that other bHLH-ZIP proteins are dose sensitive
and based on the putative function of WBSCR14 as a transcription factor,
de Luis et al. (2000) suggested that hemizygosity at this locus may be
involved in some features of WBS.

Kawaguchi et al. (2002) cloned Chrebp from rat liver. The rat Chrebp
protein shares approximately 94% and 82% identity with mouse and human
WBSCR14, respectively.

GENE FUNCTION

Cairo et al. (2001) found that WBSCR14 was expressed in multiple
tissues, including regions of the brain and the intestinal tract.
WBSCR14 formed heterodimers with the bHLH-ZIP protein Mlx (602976) to
bind the DNA sequence CACGTG. Like Max (154950), Mlx has no intrinsic
transcriptional activity, but its association with Mad1 (602686), Mad4,
Mnt (603039), or WBSCR14 can repress E-box-dependent transcription.
Preliminary results suggested a possible role of WBSCR14 in growth
control. The authors hypothesized that the Max-like bHLH-ZIP protein,
Mlx, is a key element of a transcription factor network, and that
WBSCR14 may contribute to some aspects of the WBS pathology.

Kawaguchi et al. (2001) noted that rat Chrebp is essential for
activation of the liver pyruvate kinase gene (PKLR; 609712). They stated
that Chrebp is activated by high glucose and is inhibited by cAMP. By
mutation analysis of mouse Chrebp, Kawaguchi et al. (2001) demonstrated
that the N-terminal NLS and the C-terminal bHLH and leucine zipper
domains were essential for transcription of a reporter gene from the PKL
promoter in transfected rat hepatocytes. These 2 domains were targets
for regulation by cAMP and glucose. Kawaguchi et al. (2001) found that
cAMP-dependent protein kinase (see 601639) phosphorylated ser196 near
the NLS, which inactivated nuclear import of Chrebp, and thr666 near the
bHLH domain, which dissociated Chrebp from DNA and inactivated PKL
transcription. On the other hand, high glucose stimulated
dephosphorylation, leading to translocation of Chrebp from the cytosol
into the nucleus, where dephosphorylation led to DNA binding.

Kawaguchi et al. (2002) found that acetate and fatty acids inhibited the
glucose-induced transcription of PKL in Chrebp-transfected rat
hepatocytes. Inhibition was associated with a significant increase in
cytosolic AMP and activation of AMPK (see 602739). They determined that
AMPK phosphorylated Chrebp on ser568, resulting in loss of DNA binding.

Several endocrine phenotypes, in particular impaired glucose tolerance
and silent diabetes, have been described in Williams-Beuren syndrome. A
heterodimeric complex consisting of WBSCR14 and the MAX-like protein
(MLX; 602976), binds and activates, in a glucose-dependent manner,
carbohydrate response element (ChoRE) motifs in the promoter of
lipogenic enzymes. Merla et al. (2004) identified 5 novel
WBSCR14-interacting proteins, 4 14-3-3 isotypes (beta, 601289; gamma,
605356; zeta, 601288; and theta, 609009) and NIF3L1 (605778), which form
a single polypeptide complex in mammalian cells. WBSCR14 was exported
actively from the nucleus through a CRM1-dependent mechanism. This
translocation was contingent upon the ability to bind 14-3-3. The
authors proposed that through this mechanism, the 14-3-3 isotypes may
directly affect the WBSCR14:MLX complexes, which may activate the
transcription of lipogenic genes.

Herman et al. (2012) reported that adipose tissue GLUT4 (138190)
regulates the expression of CHREBP, a transcriptional regulator of
lipogenic and glycolytic genes. Furthermore, adipose CHREBP is a major
determinant of adipose tissue fatty acid synthesis and systemic insulin
sensitivity. Herman et al. (2012) found a new mechanism for glucose
regulation of CHREBP: glucose-mediated activation of the canonical
CHREBP isoform (CHREBP-alpha) induces expression of a novel, potent
isoform (CHREBP-beta) that is transcribed from an alternative promoter.
CHREBP-beta expression in human adipose tissue predicts insulin
sensitivity.

GENE STRUCTURE

De Luis et al. (2000) determined that the WBSCR14 gene contains 17 exons
and spans 33 kb.

MAPPING

Meng et al. (1998) mapped the WBSCR14 gene to the WBS deletion region on
chromosome 7q11.23. De Luis et al. (2000) mapped the mouse Wbscr14 gene
to chromosome 5 in a region of conserved synteny with human 7q11.23.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS; 194050) is a multisystem developmental
disorder caused by the deletion of contiguous genes at chromosome
7q11.23. A common interval that includes as many as 17 genes is deleted
in most patients. Meng et al. (1998) constructed a physical map
encompassing the 1.5-Mb region that is commonly deleted in WBS. They
identified 3 genes within this region, including WBSCR14, which they
designated WS-bHLH. By EST database searching, sequencing, and screening
of a human fetal brain cDNA library, they isolated a partial WBSCR14
cDNA encoding a protein belonging to the basic helix-loop-helix
leucine-zipper family of transcription factors.

De Luis et al. (2000) fully characterized the WBSCR14 gene. They
identified 2 intragenic polymorphic dinucleotide repeats and used them
to verify hemizygosity in WBS patients. They found that the WBSCR14 cDNA
encodes an 852-amino acid protein which, in addition to the bHLH-ZIP
motif, has a bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS). Northern blot
analysis detected a 4.2-kb transcript predominantly in adult liver and
at late stages of fetal development. De Luis et al. (2000) also cloned
the mouse homolog. Given that other bHLH-ZIP proteins are dose sensitive
and based on the putative function of WBSCR14 as a transcription factor,
de Luis et al. (2000) suggested that hemizygosity at this locus may be
involved in some features of WBS.

Kawaguchi et al. (2002) cloned Chrebp from rat liver. The rat Chrebp
protein shares approximately 94% and 82% identity with mouse and human
WBSCR14, respectively.

GENE FUNCTION

Cairo et al. (2001) found that WBSCR14 was expressed in multiple
tissues, including regions of the brain and the intestinal tract.
WBSCR14 formed heterodimers with the bHLH-ZIP protein Mlx (602976) to
bind the DNA sequence CACGTG. Like Max (154950), Mlx has no intrinsic
transcriptional activity, but its association with Mad1 (602686), Mad4,
Mnt (603039), or WBSCR14 can repress E-box-dependent transcription.
Preliminary results suggested a possible role of WBSCR14 in growth
control. The authors hypothesized that the Max-like bHLH-ZIP protein,
Mlx, is a key element of a transcription factor network, and that
WBSCR14 may contribute to some aspects of the WBS pathology.

Kawaguchi et al. (2001) noted that rat Chrebp is essential for
activation of the liver pyruvate kinase gene (PKLR; 609712). They stated
that Chrebp is activated by high glucose and is inhibited by cAMP. By
mutation analysis of mouse Chrebp, Kawaguchi et al. (2001) demonstrated
that the N-terminal NLS and the C-terminal bHLH and leucine zipper
domains were essential for transcription of a reporter gene from the PKL
promoter in transfected rat hepatocytes. These 2 domains were targets
for regulation by cAMP and glucose. Kawaguchi et al. (2001) found that
cAMP-dependent protein kinase (see 601639) phosphorylated ser196 near
the NLS, which inactivated nuclear import of Chrebp, and thr666 near the
bHLH domain, which dissociated Chrebp from DNA and inactivated PKL
transcription. On the other hand, high glucose stimulated
dephosphorylation, leading to translocation of Chrebp from the cytosol
into the nucleus, where dephosphorylation led to DNA binding.

Kawaguchi et al. (2002) found that acetate and fatty acids inhibited the
glucose-induced transcription of PKL in Chrebp-transfected rat
hepatocytes. Inhibition was associated with a significant increase in
cytosolic AMP and activation of AMPK (see 602739). They determined that
AMPK phosphorylated Chrebp on ser568, resulting in loss of DNA binding.

Several endocrine phenotypes, in particular impaired glucose tolerance
and silent diabetes, have been described in Williams-Beuren syndrome. A
heterodimeric complex consisting of WBSCR14 and the MAX-like protein
(MLX; 602976), binds and activates, in a glucose-dependent manner,
carbohydrate response element (ChoRE) motifs in the promoter of
lipogenic enzymes. Merla et al. (2004) identified 5 novel
WBSCR14-interacting proteins, 4 14-3-3 isotypes (beta, 601289; gamma,
605356; zeta, 601288; and theta, 609009) and NIF3L1 (605778), which form
a single polypeptide complex in mammalian cells. WBSCR14 was exported
actively from the nucleus through a CRM1-dependent mechanism. This
translocation was contingent upon the ability to bind 14-3-3. The
authors proposed that through this mechanism, the 14-3-3 isotypes may
directly affect the WBSCR14:MLX complexes, which may activate the
transcription of lipogenic genes.

Herman et al. (2012) reported that adipose tissue GLUT4 (138190)
regulates the expression of CHREBP, a transcriptional regulator of
lipogenic and glycolytic genes. Furthermore, adipose CHREBP is a major
determinant of adipose tissue fatty acid synthesis and systemic insulin
sensitivity. Herman et al. (2012) found a new mechanism for glucose
regulation of CHREBP: glucose-mediated activation of the canonical
CHREBP isoform (CHREBP-alpha) induces expression of a novel, potent
isoform (CHREBP-beta) that is transcribed from an alternative promoter.
CHREBP-beta expression in human adipose tissue predicts insulin
sensitivity.

GENE STRUCTURE

De Luis et al. (2000) determined that the WBSCR14 gene contains 17 exons
and spans 33 kb.

MAPPING

Meng et al. (1998) mapped the WBSCR14 gene to the WBS deletion region on
chromosome 7q11.23. De Luis et al. (2000) mapped the mouse Wbscr14 gene
to chromosome 5 in a region of conserved synteny with human 7q11.23.

605485	TITLE *605485 VACUOLAR PROTEIN SORTING 41, YEAST, HOMOLOG OF; VPS41
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Ferrous transport (Fet) proteins are involved in the uptake and
processing of iron in yeast. By analysis of Fet mutants, Radisky et al.
(1997) identified yeast Vps41 as a gene required for assembly and
targeting of the high-affinity iron transport system. By searching an
EST database and screening a human heart cDNA library, they obtained a
cDNA encoding human VPS41. The deduced 854-amino acid protein contains a
C-terminal sequence highly conserved among the VPS41 homologs and also
found in clathrin heavy chain (118955). The non-yeast VPS41 homologs
also have a RING-H2 motif. Northern blot analysis detected a 3.5-kb
transcript equally expressed in all tissues tested.

MAPPING

Radisky et al. (1997) stated that the EST corresponding to VPS41 maps to
chromosome 14q23. However, Hartz (2009) mapped the VPS41 gene to
chromosome 7p14.1 based on an alignment of the VPS41 sequence (GenBank
GENBANK AK026848) with the genomic sequence (GRCh37).

609374	TITLE *609374 CELL DIVISION CYCLE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 5; CDCA5
;;SORORIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By differential expression analysis for genes coexpressed with cell
cycle genes (e.g., CDC2; 116940), Walker (2001) identified CDCA5.

Rankin et al. (2005) identified Xenopus Cdca5, which they called p35, by
a proteomic screen for anaphase-promoting complex (APC) substrates. By
searching databases for sequences similar to Xenopus p35, they
identified human and mouse CDCA5. The deduced human and mouse proteins
contain 252 and 264 amino acids, respectively. Both contain a KEN box
for APC-dependent ubiquitination. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed a
punctate nuclear distribution of CDCA5 during interphase and a diffuse
distribution of CDCA5 throughout the cell during mitosis. There was no
apparent concentration of CDCA5 on chromatin in mitotic cells. The level
of CDCA5 dropped in synchronized HeLa cells during interphase.

Nishiyama et al. (2010) found that epitope-tagged mouse sororin
accumulated on chromatin in transfected HeLa cells between early S and
G2 phases and became dispersed in the cytoplasm following nuclear
envelope breakdown. It was also enriched at centromeres in prometaphase
and metaphase.

GENE FUNCTION

Rankin et al. (2005) found that overexpression of CDCA5 in Xenopus
embryos caused failure to resolve and segregate sister chromatids in
mitosis and increased the amount of cohesin associated with metaphase
chromosomes. In cultured human and mouse cells, depletion of CDCA5
caused mitotic arrest and the complete failure of sister chromatid
cohesion. Rankin et al. (2005) hypothesized that CDCA5 regulates the
ability of the cohesin complex to mediate sister chromatid cohesion.
They proposed calling the CDCA5 protein sororin, from the Latin word
soror, meaning sister, because of its role in sister chromatid cohesion.

Using RNA interference, Nishiyama et al. (2010) found that knockdown of
sororin in HeLa cells caused failure of chromosome congression,
consistent with a cohesion defect prior to metaphase. Depletion of Scc1
(RAD21; 606462) or Sgo1 (SGOL1; 609168) in Xenopus oocytes reduced
chromosomal sororin staining, suggesting that association of sororin
with mitotic chromosomes depends upon cohesin. Geminin (GMNN; 602842), a
protein that inhibits cohesin loading onto DNA, abolished association of
sororin with chromatin. Inhibition of DNA replication in HeLa cells also
reduced sororin levels on chromatin. Knockdown studies revealed that
sororin was only required for chromosome cohesion in the presence of
WAPL (WAPAL; 610754), which functions to destabilize chromosome
cohesion. Immunoprecipitation studies showed that sororin interacted
with the WAPL-binding protein PDS5 (see PDS5A; 613200) and displaced
WAPL from its interaction with PDS5. Nishiyama et al. (2010) concluded
that sororin maintains sister chromatid cohesion by inhibiting
WAPL-induced dissociation of cohesin from DNA.

MAPPING

Hartz (2011) mapped the CDCA5 gene to chromosome 11q13.1 based on an
alignment of the CDCA5 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC011000) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

190232	TITLE *190232 TRANSITION PROTEIN 2; TNP2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

During mammalian spermiogenesis, histones are transiently replaced by
several low molecular weight, highly basic proteins called transition
proteins (TNPs), and finally by protamines, which are the principal
basic nuclear proteins of mature sperm. Four species of transition
proteins, Tnp1 through Tnp4, which facilitate chromatin transformation
from the nucleosome structure to the nucleoprotamine structure during
spermatid differentiation, were thought to occur in rat, ram, and boar.
Using cDNA probes for Tnp2 from these species, transcripts for human
TNP2 were not found in human testicular RNA or human testis cDNA
libraries. Finding homologous sequences in the human genome was greatly
facilitated, however, by the finding that, in the boar and bull genomes,
the genes for protamine-1 (PRM1, 182880) and Prm2 (182890) are clustered
with Tnp2. Schluter et al. (1992) tested a genomic human cosmid clone
containing the genes for both protamines and found that the TNP2 gene
was within a distance of 7.5 kb 3-prime of the PRM2 gene. The gene was
transcribed in human testicular RNA only at a level demonstrable by
RT-PCR and RNase protection assay. In contrast to the TNP2 genes of
mouse, rat, boar, and bull, the human TNP2 gene lacks the nucleotide
sequence GCCATCAC in its 3-prime UTR.

GENE FUNCTION

Pradeepa et al. (2008) showed that importin alpha-4 (KPNA3; 601892) was
required for active transport of Tnp2 into nuclei of rat testis germ
cells.

MAPPING

Schluter et al. (1992) determined that the TNP2 gene is clustered with
the PRM1 and PRM2 genes on chromosome 16p13.3. The 3 genes are arranged
in a DNA stretch of 13 kb, and these 3 genes are also closely linked in
boar and bull. From the restriction map of a cosmid clone, Engel et al.
(1992) concluded that the distance between PRM2 and TNP2 is about 7.5
kb. Engel et al. (1992) presented in situ hybridization data indicating
that the TNP2 gene is near the centromere of chromosome 16, in the same
area occupied by the mouse homologs of PRM1 and PRM2. Nelson and Krawetz
(1993) likewise showed from a study of a cosmid clone containing the
PRM1, PRM2 and TNP2 genes that they are closely clustered, with the TNP2
gene located 3-prime of the PRM2 gene at a distance of approximately 7
kb. A computer-assisted comparison of the sequences predicted that the
order of emergence of the 3 genes was similar to their spatial order:
PRM1-PRM2-TNP2. Presumably, the gene cluster arose from the PRM1 gene
through a series of gene duplication events.

ANIMAL MODEL

Zhao et al. (2001) found that spermatogenesis in Tnp2-null mice was
almost normal, with testis weights and epididymal sperm counts
unaffected. The only abnormality in testicular histology was a slight
increase in sperm retention in stage IX to XI tubules. Epididymal sperm
from Tnp2-null mice showed an increase in tail abnormalities. Mutant
mice were fertile but produced small litters. In step-12 to -16
spermatid nuclei from Tnp2-null mice, there was normal displacement of
histones, a compensatory translationally regulated increase in Tnp1
levels, and elevated levels of precursor and partially processed forms
of Prm2. Electron microscopy revealed abnormal focal condensations of
chromatin in step-11 to -13 spermatids and progressive chromatin
condensation in later spermatids, but condensation was still incomplete
in epididymal sperm. Compared with wildtype, mutant sperm chromatin was
more accessible to intercalating dyes and more susceptible to acid
denaturation, suggesting DNA strand breaks. Zhao et al. (2001) concluded
that TNP2 is not critical for shaping sperm nuclei, histone
displacement, initiation of chromatin condensation, binding of
protamines to DNA, or fertility, but it is necessary to maintain normal
processing of Prm2 and, consequently, the completion of chromatin
condensation.

605865	TITLE *605865 TASTE RECEPTOR TYPE 1, MEMBER 3; TAS1R3
;;T1R3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The TAS1R3 gene encodes the human homolog of mouse Sac, a major
determinant of differences between sweet-sensitive and -insensitive
mouse strains in their responsiveness to sucrose, saccharine, and other
sweeteners (Max et al., 2001).

CLONING

The ability to taste the sweetness of carbohydrate-rich foodstuffs has a
critical role in the nutritional status of humans. Although several
components of bitter transduction pathways had been identified, the
receptors and other sweet transduction elements remained unknown at the
time of studies by Max et al. (2001). The Sac locus in mouse, mapped to
the distal end of chromosome 4 (Li et al., 2001), is the major
determinant of differences between sweet-sensitive and -insensitive
strains of mice in their responsiveness to saccharine, sucrose, and
other sweeteners (Fuller, 1974). To identify the human Sac locus, Max et
al. (2001) searched for candidate genes within a region of approximately
1 million basepairs of the sequenced human genome on 1p36.33 syntenous
(the adjective used by the authors) to the region containing Sac in
mouse. From this search, they identified a likely candidate: T1R3, a
previously unknown G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) and the only GPCR
in this region. Mouse Tas1r3, encoding T1r3, maps to within 20,000
basepairs of the marker closest to Sac (Li et al., 2001) and, like human
TAS1R3, is expressed selectively in taste receptor cells. The human
TAS1R3 gene encodes a protein of 843 amino acids with 7 transmembrane
domains and an extracellular domain of 558 amino acids. The T1R3 protein
is most similar to T1R1 (TAS1R1; 606225) and T1R2 (TAS1R2; 606226), 2
other GPCRs expressed in taste cells (Hoon et al., 1999) that were
identified by Max et al. (2001) in the 1pter-1p33 region. Northern blot
analysis of mouse tissues detected expression of 3 transcripts: a 7.2-kb
mRNA in taste tissue that was not detected in control lingual tissue
devoid of taste buds; a 7.8-kb mRNA expressed at moderate levels in
testis and very low levels in brain; and a 6.7-kb mRNA expressed in very
low levels in thymus.

By in situ hybridization, Liao and Schultz (2003) found that all 3 T1R
genes were expressed selectively in human taste receptor cells in the
fungiform papillae, consistent with their role in taste perception.

Bjarnadottir et al. (2005) stated that the deduced TAS1R3 protein
contains 852 amino acids. The deduced mouse protein contains 858 amino
acids. Bjarnadottir et al. (2005) also identified the fish TAS1R3
ortholog.

GENE STRUCTURE

Max et al. (2001) predicted that the human TAS1R3 gene spans 4 kb and
contains 7 exons.

Bjarnadottir et al. (2005) determined that the TAS1R3 gene contains 8
exons.

MAPPING

Max et al. (2001) determined that the human TAS1R3 gene is located about
20 kb from the pseudouridine synthase-like gene and adjacent to DVL1
(601365) on 1p36.33. The mouse Tas1r3 gene maps to distal chromosome 4.

By searching the human genome database, Liao and Schultz (2003) found
that the T1R1, T1R2, and T1R3 genes are all located within a small
region of chromosome 1p36.

GENE FUNCTION

Nelson et al. (2001) characterized the mammalian sweet taste receptors
T1r1, T1r2, and T1r3. Transgenic rescue experiments proved that the Sac
locus encodes T1r3. Human, rat, and mouse T1Rs are only 70% identical.
The authors presented a detailed analysis of the patterns of expression
of T1Rs and T2Rs (bitter taste receptors), thus providing a view of the
representation of sweet and bitter taste at the periphery. Nelson et al.
(2001) predicted a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 5 sweet receptor genes.

Nelson et al. (2002) identified and characterized a mammalian amino acid
taste receptor, T1R1+3, as a heteromer of the T1R1 and T1R3 G
protein-coupled receptors. Nelson et al. (2002) demonstrated that T1R1
and T1R3 combine to function as a broadly tuned L-amino acid sensor
responding to most of the 20 standard amino acids, but not to their
D-enantiomers or other compounds. They also demonstrated that sequence
differences in T1R receptors within and between species (human and
mouse) can significantly influence the selectivity and specificity of
taste responses. Most amino acids that are perceived as sweet (e.g.,
alanine, glutamine, serine, threonine, or glycine) activate T1R1+3. The
responses are strictly dependent on the combined presence of T1R1 and
TIR3. T1R1+3 is prominently expressed in fungiform taste buds, which are
innervated by chorda tympani fibers. Nelson et al. (2002) generated
heteromeric receptors consisting of human and rodent T1R subunits and
assayed for activation by amino acids and artificial sweeteners. The
presence of human T1R1 or T1R2 greatly altered the sensitivity of the
amino acid receptor and the specificity of the sweet receptor. Cells
expressing human T1R1 are more than an order of magnitude more sensitive
to glutamate than to other amino acids, and cells expressing human T1R2
robustly respond to aspartame, cyclamate, and intensely sweet proteins.

Xu et al. (2004) demonstrated the different functional roles of T1R
extracellular and transmembrane domains in ligand recognition and G
protein coupling. Similar to other G protein-coupled receptors of family
C, the N-terminal venus flytrap domain of T1R2 is required for
recognizing sweeteners, such as aspartame and neotame. The G protein
coupling requires the transmembrane domain of T1R2. Surprisingly, the
C-terminal transmembrane domain of T1R3 is required for recognizing
sweetener cyclamate and sweet taste inhibitor lactisole. Because T1R3 is
the common subunit of the sweet taste receptor and the umami taste
receptor, Xu et al. (2004) tested the interaction of lactisole and
cyclamate with the umami taste receptor. Lactisole inhibited the
activity of the human T1R1/T1R3 receptor and, as predicted, blocked the
umami taste of L-glutamate in human taste tests. Cyclamate did not
activate the T1R1/T1R3 receptor by itself, but potentiated the
receptor's response to L-glutamate. Taken together, these findings
demonstrated the different functional roles of T1R3 and T1R2 and the
presence of multiple ligand binding sites on the sweet taste receptor.

'Water tastes' are gustatory after-impressions elicited by water
following the removal of a chemical solution from the mouth, akin to
color after-images appearing on white paper after fixation on colored
images. Galindo-Cuspinera et al. (2006) demonstrated that a sweet
'water-taste' is elicited when sweet-taste inhibitors are rinsed away.
Responses of cultured cells expressing the human sweetener receptor
directly parallel the psychophysical responses: water rinses remove the
inhibitor from the heteromeric sweetener receptor TAS1R2-TAS1R3, which
activates cells and results in the perception of strong sweetness from
pure water. This 'rebound' activity occurs when equilibrium forces on
the 2-state allosteric sweet receptors result in their coordinated shift
to the activated state upon being released from inhibition by rinsing.

Jang et al. (2007) examined human duodenal biopsy specimens and found
expression of T1R2, T1R3, alpha-gustducin (GNAT3; 139395), and other
taste transduction elements in the enteroendocrine L cells. Mouse
intestinal cells also expressed alpha-gustducin, and ingestion of
glucose by Gnat3-null mice revealed deficiencies in secretion of
glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP1; see 138030) and the regulation of plasma
insulin (176730) and glucose. Isolated small bowel and intestinal villi
from Gnat3-null mice showed markedly defective GLP1 secretion in
response to glucose. In human NCI-H716 L cells, GLP1 release was
promoted by sugars and the artificial sweetener sucralose and blocked by
the sweet-receptor antagonist lactisole or siRNA for alpha-gustducin.
Jang et al. (2007) concluded that L cells of the gut 'taste' glucose
through the same mechanism used by taste cells of the tongue.

Margolskee et al. (2007) demonstrated that dietary sugar and artificial
sweeteners increased sodium-dependent glucose transporter isoform-1
(SGLT1; 182380) mRNA and protein expression and increased glucose
absorptive capacity in wildtype mice but not in knockout mice lacking
T1R3 or alpha-gustducin. In mouse GLUTag enteroendocrine cells,
sucralose increased release of GLP1 and GIP (137240), gut hormones
implicated in SGLT1 upregulation, and increased intracellular calcium;
inhibition of the T1R2-T1R3 sweet taste receptor by gurmarin blocked the
sucralose-stimulated release of GLP1 and GIP and the sucralose-dependent
mobilization of calcium in GLUTag cells.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

By comparing the sequence of Tas1r3 from several independently derived
strains of mice, Max et al. (2001) identified a specific polymorphism,
I60T, that assorts between taster and nontaster strains. According to
models of its structure, T1r3 from nontasters is predicted to have an
extra N-terminal glycosylation site that, if used, would interfere with
dimerization.

In 144 unrelated individuals, consisting of 92 Europeans, 37 Asians, and
15 Africans, Fushan et al. (2009) genotyped SNPs from the TAS1R2 and
TAS1R3 genes and flanking regions, and found a significant association
between decreased sucrose taste perception and 2 SNPs in the promoter
region of the TAS1R3 gene: dbSNP rs307355 (-1572C-T) and dbSNP
rs35744813 (-1266C-T) (Bonferroni corrected p = 1.08 x 10(-4) and 2 x
10(-5), respectively). No SNPs at the TAS1R2 locus displayed significant
association with the phenotype. The dbSNP rs307355 and dbSNP rs35744813
SNPs together accounted for 16% of the observed trait variability and
appeared on the same haplotype block in all except 6 individuals.
Carriers of the C/T alleles at either SNP showed a 25% decrease in
sucrose sensitivity, and homozygotes for the T/T alleles were more
affected, showing a 50% decrease in their sucrose concentration-response
scores. In vitro functional expression studies showed that the T allele
of both SNPs resulted in significantly reduced luciferase transcription
in comparison to the C allele of both SNPs, although there was no
cumulative effect on transcription when both T alleles were present
simultaneously. When stratified by population, the C alleles were more
frequent outside of Africa, whereas the T alleles were most prevalent in
sub-Saharan African populations. Fushan et al. (2009) hypothesized that
individuals in colder geographic regions developed the ability to taste
sugars at lower concentrations, ensuring increased survival, and that
evolutionary pressure favoring high sweet sensitivity alleles in
nontropical geographic regions may have driven these alleles to high
frequency in these populations.

ANIMAL MODEL

Damak et al. (2003) generated T1r3 mice by targeted disruption. The T1r3
knockout mice were healthy and fertile with no obvious anatomic or
behavioral abnormalities. The gross anatomy of the taste tissue and
number of taste buds appeared normal in the T1r3-null mice. Knocking out
the T1r3 gene did not alter expression of T1r1 (606225) or T1r2
(606226). T1r3-null mice showed no preference for artificial sweeteners
and had diminished but not abolished behavioral and nerve responses to
sugars and umami (the taste of monosodium glutamate) compounds. Damak et
al. (2003) concluded that T1r3-independent sweet- and umami-responsive
receptors and/or pathways exist in taste cells.

Sweet and umami are the main attractive taste modalities in humans. T1Rs
are mammalian taste receptors that combine to assemble 2 heteromeric G
protein-coupled receptor complexes: T1R1+3, an umami sensor, and T1R2+3,
a sweet receptor. Zhao et al. (2003) reported the behavioral and
physiologic characterization of T1r1, T1r2, and T1r3 knockout mice. They
demonstrated that sweet and umami taste were strictly dependent on T1R
receptors and showed that selective elimination of T1R subunits
differentially abolished detection and perception of these 2 taste
modalities. To examine the basis of sweet tastant recognition and
coding, they engineered animals expressing either the human T1R2
receptor or a modified engineered opioid receptor, RASSL, in sweet
cells. Expression of T1R2 in mice generated animals with humanized sweet
taste preferences, while expression of RASSL drove strong attraction to
a synthetic opiate, demonstrating that sweet cells trigger dedicated
behavioral outputs, but their tastant selectivity is determined by the
nature of the receptors.

136132	TITLE *136132 FLAVIN-CONTAINING MONOOXYGENASE 3; FMO3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The mammalian flavin-containing monooxygenases (FMO; EC 1.14.13.8)
represent a multigene family whose gene products are localized in the
endoplasmic reticulum of many tissues. These enzymes catalyze the
NADPH-dependent oxidative metabolism of many drugs, pesticides, and
other foreign compounds. Their substrates are soft nucleophiles with an
electron-rich center, typically a nitrogen, sulfur or
phosphorus-containing functional group, as the site for oxidative attack
by the enzyme (Ziegler, 1990; Hines et al., 1994).

CLONING

Lomri et al. (1992) isolated a full-length cDNA sequence for FMO3, which
they designated FMO II, from an adult human liver cDNA library. This
cDNA encoded a deduced 533-amino acid protein.

Dolphin et al. (1996) also isolated an FMO3 cDNA from a human liver
library. This cDNA encoded a deduced 532-amino acid protein that shared
84% sequence identity with the rabbit FMO3 protein.

GENE STRUCTURE

Dolphin et al. (1997) determined that the FMO3 gene contains 1 noncoding
and 8 coding exons.

MAPPING

By use of PCR with DNAs from somatic cell hybrids, Shephard et al.
(1993) mapped the FMO3 gene to chromosome 1. FMO3 is probably located in
a cluster with FMO1 (136130) and FMO4 (136131) at 1q23-q25.

GENE FUNCTION

Using quantitative RNase protection assays, Phillips et al. (1995) and
Dolphin et al. (1996) determined that FMO3 is present in low abundance
in fetal liver and lung and in adult kidney and lung, and in much
greater abundance in adult liver. They determined that FMO3 and FMO1
(136130) are subject to developmental and tissue-specific regulation
and, in the liver, there is a developmental switch in the expression of
these genes.

By Western blot analysis of human liver microsomal samples ranging from
8 weeks gestation to 18 years of age, Koukouritaki et al. (2002)
confirmed that FMO1 is the major fetal isoform and FMO3 is the major
adult isoform. The highest level of FMO1 expression was observed in
embryonic samples at 8 to 15 weeks of gestation; its expression was low,
but detectable in most samples within the first 3 days of life, but then
was extinguished in all but a few samples. In contrast, the onset of
FMO3 expression was highly variable, with most individuals failing to
express this isoform during the neonatal period. FMO3 was expressed at
intermediate levels until 11 years of age when a gender-independent
increase in FMO3 expression was observed during puberty. Koukouritaki et
al. (2002) observed pronounced interindividual variation of FMO3 protein
levels from 2- to 20-fold.

Phillips and Shephard (2008) noted that the delay between silencing of
the FMO1 gene and the full activation of FMO3 means that during the
first year of life many children have no, or very little,
drug-metabolizing FMOs in their liver.

Hernandez et al. (2003) pointed out that compromised activity of FMO3 is
expected to have implications for the efficacy of drug treatment and the
possibility of adverse drug reactions in patients with trimethylaminuria
(TMAU; 602079) and in the general population. In addition to
metabolizing the dietary-derived amine TMA, FMO3 catalyzes the
NADPH-dependent oxidation of numerous foreign compounds, including
therapeutic drugs such as the antiestrogen tamoxifen, the antifungal
ketoconazole, and the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs sulindac
sulfide and benzydamine, as reviewed by Cashman and Zhang (2002).
Sufferers of trimethylaminuria may display a reduced ability to
metabolize substrates for FMO3 such as nicotine (Ayesh et al., 1988).

FMO3 metabolizes a number of drugs, including amphetamine, clozapine,
deprenyl, metamphetamine, tamoxifen, ethionamide, thiacetazone, and
sulindac sulfide (see reviews by Krueger and Williams (2005) and
Phillips and Shephard (2008)).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Akerman et al. (1997) and Treacy et al. (1998) reported 3 different
mutations in the FMO3 gene in Australian probands with trimethylaminuria
(602079), or fish-odor syndrome, who shared a particular polymorphic
haplotype. Treacy et al. (1998) showed that these mutations impair
N-oxygenation of xenobiotics and are responsible for the
trimethylaminuria phenotype. A nonsense mutation, glu305 to ter (E305X;
136132.0001), was found on 6 mutant chromosomes of British origin,
homozygous in 1 and heterozygous in 4 individuals. Homozygosity for a
missense mutation, val257 to met (V257M; 136132.0002), was found in 1
individual of Greek origin. Heterozygosity for a met66-to-ile (M66I;
136132.0003) mutation was found in 1 individual of Irish extraction.

In a patient with trimethylaminuria, Dolphin et al. (1997) found a
pro153-to-leu mutation in the FMO3 gene (P153L; 136132.0004) that
abolished FMO3 catalytic activity. They demonstrated that FMO3 with the
551C-T mutation could not support the metabolism of dietary-derived
trimethylamine (TMA). In addition to TMA, FMOs catalyze the oxidation of
a range of structurally diverse compounds, including drugs, pesticides,
and other xenobiotics. The authors commented that although patients with
trimethylaminuria are apparently deficient in nicotine N-oxidation, a
reaction catalyzed predominantly by FMO3, the pharmacologic and
toxicologic significance of an inherited block in FMO3-mediated
oxidative metabolism is unclear.

Treacy et al. (1998) found that nonsense and missense mutations in the
FMO3 gene were associated with a severe trimethylaminuria phenotype and
were also implicated in impaired metabolism of other nitrogen- and
sulfur-containing substances, including biogenic amines, both clinically
and when mutated proteins expressed from cDNA were studied in vitro. The
findings illustrated the clinical role played by human FMO3 in the
metabolism of xenobiotic substrates and endogenous amines. One patient
of English-Irish extraction with severe hypertension was observed with
blood pressure of 200/110 following the use of nasal epinephrine.
Adverse tyramine reactions were observed in at least 3 patients.
Urticaria and intolerance of sulfur-containing medication was observed
in a patient homozygous for the P153L mutation.

Chung and Cha (1997) showed that production of theobromine from caffeine
is catalyzed primarily by the FMO present in adult human liver
microsomes. They determined FMO activity in vivo noninvasively by taking
the urinary molar concentration ratio of theobromine/caffeine in a
Korean population. In 82 Korean volunteers, Park et al. (1999)
determined FMO activity by taking the molar concentration ratio of
theobromine and caffeine present in the 1-hour urine (between 4 and 5
hours) samples collected after administration of a cup of coffee
containing 110 mg of caffeine. Among 82 volunteers, there were 19 women
and 63 men (30 smokers and 52 nonsmokers). Volunteers were divided into
2 groups comprising low (0.53-2.99) and high (3.18-11.95) FMO activities
separated by an antimode of 3.18. Genomic DNAs from peripheral blood
were amplified by PCR with oligonucleotides designed from intronic
sequences of the human FMO3 gene. Comparing nucleotide sequences of the
amplified FMO3 gene originating from randomly selected individuals with
low and high FMO activities, 9 point mutations were identified in the
open reading frame sequences.

Akerman et al. (1999) studied a cohort of North American individuals
with severe trimethylaminuria, defined by a reduction of TMA oxidation
below 50% of normal. They detected 4 novel FOM3 mutations, including 2
missense mutations, ala52 to thr (A52T; 136132.0008) and arg387 to leu
(R387L; 136132.0007), and 1 nonsense mutation, glu314 to ter (E314X;
136132.0009). The fourth allele was apparently composed of 2 relatively
common polymorphisms (lys158-gly308) found in the general population.
For the E314X mutation, loss of activity was strongly predicted due to
truncation of the FMO3 protein at codon 314, since deletion of even the
final 30 amino acids of this 532-residue protein will ablate function in
vitro. While the A52T and R387L mutations had not been expressed, they
satisfied several conditions for designation as disease-causing: the
changes were not observed in controls, they were nonconservative
substitutions, and no other changes were identified in the probands when
sequencing all expressed FMO3 exons. Furthermore, the A52T and R387L
residues appear to be highly conserved within the FMO gene family. The
authors suggested that the 2 common changes (lys158-gly308) in cis
diminished the activity of the enzyme and rendered it incapable of
compensating for the A52T mutation carried by the other allele.

Hernandez et al. (2003) described a human FMO3 mutation database. They
indicated that 16 mutations (12 missense, 3 nonsense, and 1 gross
deletion) were known to cause trimethylaminuria.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
TRIMETHYLAMINURIA
FMO3, GLU305TER

Akerman et al. (1997) identified a glu305-to-ter (E305X) mutation in 6
mutant chromosomes from Australian probands of British origin with
trimethylaminuria (602079). The mutation was homozygous in 1 and
heterozygous in 4 individuals. The E305X homozygote had, in addition to
trimethylaminuria, tachycardia and severe hypertension after eating
cheese (which contains tyramine) and after using nasal epinephrine in
the treatment of an epistaxis (Danks et al., 1976). The FMO3 enzyme
metabolizes tyramine. Mutant FMO3 cDNA for this mutation demonstrated
loss of substrate activity for TMA and tyramine when expressed in E.
coli.

.0002
TRIMETHYLAMINURIA
FMO3, VAL257MET

In an Australian individual of Greek origin with trimethylaminuria
(602079), Akerman et al. (1997) found homozygosity for a val257-to-met
(V257M) missense mutation.

.0003
TRIMETHYLAMINURIA
FMO3, MET66ILE

In an Australian individual of Irish origin with trimethylaminuria
(602079), Akerman et al. (1997) found a met66-to-ile (M66I) mutation in
the FMO3 gene in heterozygous state. Mutant FMO3 cDNA containing the
M66I substitution demonstrated loss of substrate activity for TMA and
tyramine when expressed in E. coli.

In an Australian patient with trimethylaminuria, Akerman et al. (1999)
found compound heterozygosity for 2 missense mutations in the FMO3 gene:
M66I and arg492 to trp (136132.0005). The second of these mutations
involved a hypermutable CpG site and was a nonconservative change in a
highly conserved region of the FMO3 gene. This arginine in codon 492 was
conserved in all FMO isoforms.

.0004
TRIMETHYLAMINURIA
FMO3, PRO153LEU

In a brother and sister of a family with trimethylaminuria (602079),
Dolphin et al. (1997) identified a homozygous 551C-T transition in the
FMO3 gene, changing a CCC proline triplet at codon 153 to a CTC leucine
triplet (P153L). Their parents and a third sib were heterozygous. They
found the same mutation in 2 other trimethylaminuria kindreds, in which
it also cosegregated with the disorder. In the first kindred studied,
the leu153 allele was found to carry a polymorphism at codon 158, namely
glu158. Among 30 unrelated, non-trimethylaminuric individuals, pro153
was found in all, whereas glu158 and lys158 occurred in frequencies of
approximately 50% each.

FMO3 ACTIVITY, DECREASED
FMO3, GLY148TER

Park et al. (1999) determined FMO activity by taking the molar
concentration ratio of theobromine and caffeine present in the 1-hour
urine (between 4 and 5 hours) samples collected after administration of
a cup of coffee containing 110 mg of caffeine. In an individual who had
the second lowest FMO activity, they detected a missense mutation,
442G-T in exon 4, that yielded a premature TGA stop codon replacing
glycine-148. He had the mutation in heterozygous state. His mother also
had the heterozygous stop codon and equally low FMO activity.

.0007
TRIMETHYLAMINURIA
FMO3, ARG387LEU

In a Metis patient from Canada with trimethylaminuria (602079), Akerman
et al. (1999) found homozygosity for a G-to-T transversion at nucleotide
1160 of the FMO3 gene, resulting in an arg387-to-leu mutation.

In a North American patient with trimethylaminuria (602079), Akerman et
al. (1999) identified a G-to-A transition at nucleotide 154 of the FMO3
gene, resulting in an ala52-to-thr mutation.

.0009
TRIMETHYLAMINURIA
FMO3, GLU314TER

In a North American patient with trimethylaminuria (602079), Akerman et
al. (1999) identified a G-to-T transversion at nucleotide 940 of the
FMO3 gene, resulting in a glu314-to-ter substitution.

.0010
TRIMETHYLAMINURIA
FMO3, ASN61SER

Dolphin et al. (2000) found 2 individuals with trimethylaminuria
(602079) who were compound heterozygotes for the P153L missense mutation
(136132.0004) and a novel asn61-to-ser (N61S) mutation in the FMO3 gene.

.0011
TRIMETHYLAMINURIA
FMO3, MET434ILE

Dolphin et al. (2000) found that a patient with trimethylaminuria
(602079) was a compound heterozygote for the R492W mutation
(136132.0005) and a novel met434-to-ile (M434I) mutation in the FMO3
gene.

.0012
TRIMETHYLAMINURIA
FMO3, 2-EX DEL

Forrest et al. (2001) described trimethylaminuria (602079) caused by a
deletion of more than 12 kb in the FMO3 gene in a 15-year-old Australian
male of Greek parents. The deletion began 328 bp upstream from exon 1;
the 3-prime end of the deletion occurred in intron 2. The deletion was
12,226 bp long. Because of homozygosity for the FMO3 gene deletion, it
was predicted that in addition to loss of monooxygenase function for
human FMO3 substrates, such as trimethylamine and other amines, the
proband would exhibit decreased tolerance of biogenic amines, both
medicinal and dietary.

.0013
TRIMETHYLAMINURIA
FMO3, GLU32LYS

In a patient with trimethylaminuria (602079), Zhang et al. (2003)
identified a glu32-to-lys (E32K) mutation in the FMO3 gene. Expression
studies showed that the E32K mutation abrogated the catalytic activity
of the enzyme.

.0014
TRIMETHYLAMINURIA
FMO3, 1-BP DEL, 191A

In an individual with trimethylaminuria (602079), Zhang et al. (2003)
identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the FMO3 gene: a
P153L change (136132.0004) and a 1-bp deletion (191delA) in exon 3 at
codon 64. The deletion resulted in a frameshift and premature
termination of the gene immediately after codon 65. Family pedigree
analysis revealed that the 2 mutations were carried on different alleles
in this individual. Both mutations abolished the catalytic activity of
the enzyme, explaining the severe clinical expression of
trimethylaminuria. The patient was examined at the age of 3 years, at
which time he was found to have 61% unmetabolized trimethylamine in
urine, compatible with severe trimethylaminuria.

.0015
TRIMETHYLAMINURIA, MILD
FMO3, GLU308GLY AND GLU158LYS

In patients with mild trimethylaminuria, Zschocke et al. (1999)
identified compound heterozygosity for mutations in the FMO3 gene: a
P151L substitution (136132.004) on one allele, and 2 common
polymorphisms, glu308 to gly (E308G) and glu 158 to lys (E258K), on the
other. Zschocke et al. (1999) noted that homozygosity for the P151L
mutation had been found to cause severe trimethylaminuria. They found
that individuals homozygous for the variant allele with the 2 common
polymorphisms had decreased TMA oxidation capacity (less than 50%)
indicative of mild trimethylaminuria,

607888	TITLE *607888 CKLF-LIKE MARVEL TRANSMEMBRANE DOMAIN-CONTAINING 5; CMTM5
;;CHEMOKINE-LIKE FACTOR SUPERFAMILY, MEMBER 5; CKLFSF5
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the chemokine-like factor superfamily, including CKLFSF5,
share similarity with both the chemokine (see 604852) and the
transmembrane 4 (see 300191) superfamilies of signaling molecules.

CLONING

By screening databases for sequences that share homology with
chemokine-like factor (CKLF), followed by RT-PCR of a brain cDNA
library, Han et al. (2003) cloned CKLFSF5. They also identified
alternatively spliced variants. One isoform encodes a 156-amino acid
protein with 4 transmembrane segments. CKLFSF5 shares about 40% sequence
identity with CKLFSF3 (607886). Northern blot analysis detected a
1.22-kb transcript and several minor transcripts expressed at high
levels in brain. Han et al. (2003) also cloned mouse Cklfsf5, which
shares about 90% sequence similarity with CKLFSF5.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Han et al. (2003) mapped the CKLFSF5 gene
to chromosome 14. They also mapped the mouse Cklfsf5 gene to chromosome
14.

614553	TITLE *614553 N6 ADENINE-SPECIFIC DNA METHYLTRANSFERASE 1, PUTATIVE; N6AMT1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to yeast Mtq2, Ren et
al. (2011) identified human N6AMT1. N6AMT1 shares about 25% identity
with the arsenic methyltransferase AS3MT (611806), but it contains only
1 of 3 motifs conserved in AS3MT orthologs. Real-time quantitative PCR
detected N6AMT1 expression in all 48 human tissues examined. Highest
expression was in parathyroid and pituitary glands, followed by adrenal
gland and kidney, and lowest expression was in leukocytes and mammary
gland.

GENE FUNCTION

Using the normal human uroepithelium cell line UROtsa, Ren et al. (2011)
found that overexpression of N6AMT1 increased cellular resistance to
treatment with trivalent inorganic arsenic (iAs(3+)). N6AMT1
overexpression had a more pronounced effect following treatment with the
more toxic trivalent monomethylarsonic acid (MMA(3+)). Analysis of the
arsenic metabolic profile revealed no methylated metabolites following
iAs(3+) treatment, but higher content of MMA(5+) and appearance of
dimethylarsonic acid (DMA(5+)) following MMA(3+) treatment.

MAPPING

Hartz (2012) mapped the N6AMT1 gene to chromosome 21q21.3 based on an
alignment of the N6AMT1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF139682) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

600061	TITLE *600061 RAD23, YEAST, HOMOLOG OF, A; RAD23A
;;HHR23A
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Masutani et al. (1994) reported the purification to homogeneity and
subsequent cDNA cloning from HeLa cells of a repair complex by in vitro
complementation of the xeroderma pigmentosum group C (278720) defect in
a cell-free repair system containing UV-damaged SV40 minichromosomes.
The complex had a high affinity for ssDNA and consisted of 2 tightly
associated proteins of 125 and 58 kD. The 125-kD subunit represented the
previously reported XPC gene (613208) product, which represents the
human homolog of the nucleotide excision repair (NER) gene RAD4 of
Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The 58-kD species turned out to be a human
homolog of yeast RAD23. Unexpectedly, a second human counterpart of
RAD23 was identified. The 2 genes, which Masutani et al. (1994) referred
to as HHR23A (RAD23A) and HHR23B (RAD23B; 600062), were expressed in the
same cells. In the XPC purification scheme, however, only the RAD23B
protein was found in a complex with p125/XPC.

In the mouse, van der Spek et al. (1996) cloned the homologs of both
RAD23A and RAD23B. Detailed sequence comparisons permitted deductions
concerning the structure of all RAD23 homologs. Northern blot analysis
revealed constitutive expression of both RAD23 genes in all tissues
examined. Elevated RNA expression of both genes was observed in testis.

MAPPING

Using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), van der Spek et al.
(1994) demonstrated that the RAD23A gene is located on 19p13.2.

By FISH, van der Spek et al. (1996) assigned the Rad23a gene to mouse
chromosome 8C3 and the Rad23b gene to mouse chromosome 4B3.

GENE FUNCTION

Masutani et al. (1994) commented that no human mutant defective in
RAD23A had been identified. They suggested that the nature of the defect
in xeroderma pigmentosum group C implies that the XPC-RAD23B complex
exerts a unique function in the genome-overall repair pathway that is
important for prevention of skin cancer.

Van der Spek et al. (1996) found that although the RAD23 equivalents are
well conserved during evolution, the mammalian genes do not express the
UV-inducible phenotype of their yeast counterpart. The authors stated
that this discovery may point to a fundamental difference between the UV
responses of yeast and human.

Machado-Joseph disease (MJD; 109150) is an autosomal dominant
neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expansion of the polyglutamine
tract near the C terminus of the MJD1 gene product, ataxin-3. The mutant
ataxin-3 forms intranuclear inclusions in cultured cells as well as in
diseased human brain and also causes cell death in transfected cells.
Using a 2-hybrid system, Wang et al. (2000) found that ataxin-3
interacts with 2 human homologs of the yeast DNA repair protein RAD23,
RAD23A and RAD23B. Both normal and mutant ataxin-3 proteins interact
with the ubiquitin-like domain at the N terminus of the RAD23 proteins,
which is a motif important for nucleotide excision repair. However, in
human embryonic kidney cells RAD23 is recruited to intranuclear
inclusions formed by the mutant ataxin-3 through its interaction with
ataxin-3. The authors suggested that this interaction may be associated
with the normal function of ataxin-3, and that some functional
abnormality of the RAD23 proteins may exist in MJD.

611400	TITLE *611400 HOX TRANSCRIPT ANTISENSE RNA, NONCODING; HOTAIR
;;HOX ANTISENSE INTERGENIC RNA;;
LONG INTERGENIC NONCODING RNA HOTAIR;;
lincRNA HOTAIR
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs), such as HOTAIR, regulate
dosage compensation, imprinting, and developmental gene expression by
establishing chromatin domains in an allele- and cell-type specific
manner. HOTAIR coordinates histone modifications by serving as a modular
scaffold for multiple histone modification complexes (Tsai et al.,
2010).

CLONING

During embryonic development, fibroblasts show patterns of HOX gene
expression that reflect their position along the anterior-posterior and
proximal-distal axes of the developing body. Adult human fibroblasts
retain many features of the embryonic pattern of HOX gene expression,
including positional effects. Using HOX tiling arrays to profile
transcripts from fibroblasts representing 11 different positions of the
adult body, Rinn et al. (2007) identified more than 200 HOX ncRNAs,
including HOTAIR. Molecular cloning and Northern blot analysis confirmed
that the 2,158-nucleotide HOTAIR transcript is spliced and
polyadenylated. Tiling array data and RT-PCR showed that HOTAIR was
preferentially expressed in fibroblasts obtained from posterior and
distal sites in adult human, with highest expression in fibroblasts
obtained from the foot. In situ hybridization of developing mouse
embryos confirmed that Hotair was expressed in posterior and distal
sites, indicating conservation of the anatomic expression pattern from
development to adulthood. The HOTAIR nucleotide sequence is highly
conserved in vertebrates, whereas the amino acid sequence contains
numerous stop codons and is not conserved, suggesting that HOTAIR
functions as a long ncRNA.

GENE FUNCTION

Rinn et al. (2007) showed that depletion of HOTAIR ncRNA by RNA
interference in primary human fibroblasts led to dramatic
transcriptional activation across 40 kb of the HOXD locus on chromosome
2, including HOXD8 (142985), HOXD9 (142982), HOXD10 (142984), HOXD11
(142986), and multiple ncRNAs. Depletion of HOTAIR resulted in global
loss of histone-3 (see 602810) trimethylation on lys27 over the HOXD
locus, with greatest loss in the intergenic region between HOXD4
(142981) and HOXD8. HOTAIR depletion also caused a modest but consistent
loss of SUZ12 (606245) occupancy on the HOXD locus, suggesting that
HOTAIR is required to target Polycomb repressive complex-2 (PRC2)
occupancy and activity to silence transcription of the HOXD locus.
Immunoprecipitation of SUZ12 from nuclear extracts of foot and foreskin
primary human fibroblasts retrieved endogenous HOTAIR ncRNA. Reciprocal
protein-binding assays with HeLa cell lysates showed that the PRC2
components SUZ12 and EZH2 (601573), but not PRC1 components, bound
HOTAIR.

Gupta et al. (2010) showed that lincRNAs in HOX loci become
systematically dysregulated during breast cancer progression. The
lincRNA termed HOTAIR is increased in expression in primary breast
tumors and metastases, and HOTAIR expression level in primary tumors is
a powerful predictor of eventual metastasis and death. Enforced
expression of HOTAIR in epithelial cancer cells induced genomewide
retargeting of Polycomb repressive complex-2 (PRC2; see 601674) to an
occupancy pattern more resembling embryonic fibroblasts, leading to
altered histone H3 lysine-27 (H3K27) methylation, gene expression, and
increased cancer invasiveness and metastasis in a manner dependent on
PRC2. Conversely, loss of HOTAIR can inhibit cancer invasiveness,
particularly in cells that possess excessive PRC2 activity. Gupta et al.
(2010) concluded that lincRNAs have active roles in modulating the
cancer epigenome and may be important targets for cancer diagnosis and
therapy.

Tsai et al. (2010) showed that HOTAIR serves as a scaffold for at least
2 distinct histone modification complexes. A 5-prime domain of HOTAIR
binds polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), whereas a 3-prime domain of
HOTAIR binds the LSD1/CoREST/REST complex (see 609132). The ability to
tether 2 distinct complexes enables RNA-mediated assembly of PCR2 and
LSD1 and coordinates targeting of PRC2 and LSD1 to chromatin for coupled
H3K27 methylation and H3K4 demethylation. Tsai et al. (2010) concluded
that lincRNAs may serve as scaffolds by providing binding surfaces to
assemble select histone modification enzymes, thereby specifying the
pattern of histone modifications on target genes.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Rinn et al. (2007) mapped the HOTAIR gene
to chromosome 12. It is located on the opposite strand within the
intergenic region between HOXC11 (605559) and HOXC12 (142975).

300873	TITLE *300873 GUANINE NUCLEOTIDE-BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE 3-LIKE PROTEIN; GNL3L
;;GNL3-LIKE PROTEIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database analysis and RT-PCR of a HeLa cell cDNA library, Du et al.
(2006) cloned GNL3L, a putative human ortholog of yeast Grn1. Both Grn1
and GNL3L have at least 4 circularly permuted GTPase motifs and a
C-terminal RG stretch predicted to bind RNA. Fluorescence-tagged Grnl
and GNL3L localized predominantly to nucleoli of yeast and COS-7 cells,
respectively.

Meng et al. (2011) noted that the 582-amino acid human GNL3L protein
contains an N-terminal basic region, followed by a basic coiled-coil
domain, a GTP-binding domain, an intermediate region, and a C-terminal
domain. It also has a nucleolar localization signal.

GENE FUNCTION

Du et al. (2006) found that knockout of Grn1 expression in fission yeast
resulted in growth arrest, failure of cytokinesis, impaired pre-rRNA
processing, and nucleolar accumulation of the ribosomal protein Rpl25a.
When expressed from the yeast Grn1 promoter, human GNL3L completely
complemented Grn1 deletion. Knockdown of GNL3L expression in HeLa cells
also reduced cell proliferation. Du et al. (2006) hypothesized that Grn1
and GNL3L are involved in early 5-prime pre-rRNA processing and/or
assembly and export of precursor ribonucleoprotein complexes from the
nucleolus.

Meng et al. (2011) found that knockdown of GNL3L in human cell lines
triggered G2/M arrest and upregulation of the p53 (TP53; 191170) targets
BAX (600040), 14-3-3-sigma (SFN; 601290), and p21 (CDKN1A; 116899).
Coimmunoprecipitation analysis revealed that GNL3L bound directly to and
stabilized MDM2 (164785), a protein that regulates p53 ubiquitination
and proteasome-mediated degradation. GNL3L interacted with MDM2 in the
nucleoplasm and stabilized MDM2 under basal conditions against its
ubiquitination and degradation. In contrast, the GNL3L paralog
nucleostemin (GNL3; 608011) interacts with and stabilizes MDM2 during
cell cycle counting or following cell stress only. However, depletion of
nucleostemin induced a compensatory upregulation of GNL3L in both
p53-expressing and p53-null HCT116 cells. Meng et al. (2011) concluded
that GNL3L is a constitutive regulator of MDM2 stability.

MAPPING

Hartz (2012) mapped the GNL3L gene to chromosome Xp11.22 based on an
alignment of the GNL3L sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK001475) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

613283	TITLE *613283 GLUTAREDOXIN, CYSTEINE-RICH, 1; GRXCR1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Schraders et al. (2010) cloned human GRXCR1, which encoded a deduced
290-amino acid protein containing a putative glutaredoxin catalytic
domain and a cysteine-rich C-terminal region. The glutaredoxin domain is
predicted to function in the reversible S-glutathionylation of proteins.
Quantitative PCR detected high GRXCR1 expression in fetal cochlea,
moderate expression in adult testis, low expression in fetal heart and
adult duodenum and brain, and little to no expression in other adult and
fetal tissues examined.

Hunker et al. (2005) stated that the mouse Grxcr1 gene contains 290
amino acids. They found that transfected Grxcr1 was closely associated
with actin filament-like structures on the dorsal/apical surface of
cultured cells.

Odeh et al. (2010) found that 2 groups of 4 cysteines in the C-terminal
cysteine-rich domain of mouse Grxcr1 were predicted to fold into a zinc
finger configuration. They found that the central glutaredoxin-like
domain and cysteine-rich C terminus of GRXCR1 was highly conserved
between vertebrates. Grxcr1 was expressed in sensory epithelial of the
mouse inner ear and localized along the length of stereocilia of
auditory and vestibular hair cells in mouse cochlear explants. It also
localized along the length of actin filament-rich structures in
filopodia in monkey fibroblasts and in microvilli at the apical surface
of porcine kidney epithelial cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Schraders et al. (2010) determined that the GRXCR1 gene contains 4
exons.

MAPPING

Schraders et al. (2010) mapped the GRXCR1 gene to chromosome 4p13. Odeh
et al. (2004) mapped the mouse pirouette (pi) locus, containing the
Grxcr1 gene, to a region of mouse chromosome 5 that shares syntenic
homology with human chromosome 4.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 3 sibs from a nonconsanguineous Dutch family, 1 sporadic Dutch
patient, and affected members of 2 consanguineous Pakistani families
with autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss (DFNB25; 613285)
mapping to 4p13, Schraders et al. (2010) identified homozygosity for 1
missense, 1 nonsense, and 2 splice site mutations in the GRXCR1 gene
(613283.0001-613283.0004, respectively) that cosegregated with disease
and were not found in 180 Dutch or 240 Pakistani controls.

ANIMAL MODEL

Pirouette (pi) is an autosomal recessive mutation that arose
spontaneously in the C3H inbred strain of mice. Pi/pi mice are fertile
and have a normal life span. They show circling, head-tossing behavior,
and hyperactivity, and develop profound hearing loss in the early
postnatal period. Sensory hair cells in the organ of Corti in pi/pi mice
show early degeneration, and beyond 1 month of age, pi/pi mice exhibit
degeneration of other cell types, including spinal ganglion and cells in
the stria vascularis. Odeh et al. (2004) found that pi and 2 additional
strains of mice with inner ear dysfunction, transgenic line 370
(pi-tg370) and Tasmanian devil (pi-tde), represent 3 independent allelic
mutations at the pi locus. Hunker et al. (2005) reported that pi is a
mutation of the mouse Grxcr1 gene.

Odeh et al. (2010) identified 2 additional mouse strains, nm2766 (pi-2j)
and nm3325 (pi-3j), that exhibit similar vestibular and auditory
deficits due to spontaneous recessive mutations in the Grxcr1 gene. Odeh
et al. (2010) showed that loss of Grxcr1 function in pirouette mice
resulted in abnormally thin and slightly shortened stereocilia.

In 3 affected sibs from a nonconsanguineous Dutch family with autosomal
recessive deafness-25 (613285), Schraders et al. (2010) identified
homozygosity for a splice site mutation (628-9C-A) in intron 2 of the
GRXCR1 gene, predicted to create a different splice acceptor site. The
mutation was not found in unaffected family members or in 180 Dutch
controls. Analysis of GRXCR1 cDNA from 2 of the affected sibs
demonstrated the presence of 7 additional base pairs between exons 2 and
3, leading to a frameshift and a premature stop codon.

resulting in an arg138-to-cys (R138C) substitution at a highly conserved
residue. The mutation was not found in unaffected family members or in
240 Pakistani controls.

602355	TITLE *602355 TNF RECEPTOR-ASSOCIATED FACTOR 6; TRAF6
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The transcription factor NF-kappa-B (see 164011) is activated by many
cytokines that signal through different cell surface receptors. Members
of the TRAF protein family have been implicated in the activation of
this transcription factor by the tumor necrosis factor (TNF; 191160)
superfamily. By database analysis and screening human cDNA libraries,
Cao et al. (1996) cloned TRAF6, a novel human TRAF. The deduced
522-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 57 kD. It has
a cysteine-rich N terminus that includes a RING finger and 5 potential
zinc fingers, followed by a TRAF-N domain and a C-terminal TRAF-C
domain. Northern blot analysis detected variable expression of TRAF6
transcripts of about 2.5, 4, and 8 kb in all human tissues examined.

GENE FUNCTION

Cao et al. (1996) showed that when overexpressed in cultured human
cells, TRAF6 activates NF-kappa-B. A dominant-negative mutant of TRAF6
inhibited this activation signaled by interleukin-1 (IL1A; 147760). IL1A
treatment of the same cells induced the association of TRAF6 with
interleukin-1-associated kinase (IRAK; 300283), a serine/threonine
kinase that is rapidly recruited to the IL1A receptor after IL1A
induction. The findings were interpreted as indicating that TRAF
proteins function as signal transducers for distinct receptor families
in that TRAF6 participates in IL1A signaling.

TRANCE (or RANKL; 602642), a TNF family member, and its receptor, RANK
(603499), are critical regulators of dendritic cell and osteoclast
function. Wong et al. (1999) demonstrated that TRANCE activates the
antiapoptotic serine/threonine kinase PKB (AKT1; 164730) through a
signaling complex involving SRC (190090) and TRAF6. A deficiency in SRC
or addition of SRC family kinase inhibitors blocked TRANCE-mediated PKB
activation in osteoclasts. SRC and TRAF6 interacted with each other and
with RANK upon receptor engagement. TRAF6, in turn, enhanced the kinase
activity of SRC, leading to tyrosine phosphorylation of downstream
signaling molecules such as CBL (165360). These results defined a
mechanism by which TRANCE activates SRC family kinases and PKB, and
provided evidence of cross-talk between TRAF proteins and SRC family
kinases.

TRAF6 is a signal transducer in the NF-kappa-B pathway that activates
I-kappa-B kinase (IKK; see 600664) in response to proinflammatory
cytokines. Deng et al. (2000) purified a heterodimeric protein complex
that links TRAF6 to IKK activation. Peptide mass fingerprinting analysis
revealed that this complex, which they called TRIKA1 (TRAF6-regulated
IKK activator-1), is composed of the ubiquitin conjugating enzyme UBC13
(603679) and the UBC-like protein UBE2V1 (602995). They found that
TRAF6, a RING domain protein, functions together with UBC13/UBE2V1 to
catalyze the synthesis of unique polyubiquitin chains linked through
lysine-63 (K63) of ubiquitin. Blockade of this polyubiquitin chain
synthesis, but not inhibition of the proteasome, prevents the activation
of IKK by TRAF6. These results unveil a new regulatory function for
ubiquitin, in which IKK is activated through the assembly of K63-linked
polyubiquitin chains.

Wang et al. (2001) determined that TRIKA2, the second factor required
for IKK activation in the presence of TRAF6 and TRIKA1, is composed of
TAK1 (602614) and its binding partners, TAB1 (602615) and TAB2 (605101).

Takayanagi et al. (2000) demonstrated that T-cell production of
interferon-gamma (IFNG; 147570) strongly suppresses osteoclastogenesis
by interfering with the RANKL-RANK signaling pathway. IFNG induces rapid
degradation of the RANK adaptor protein, TRAF6, resulting in strong
inhibition of the RANKL-induced activation of the transcription factor
NFKB and JNK (601158). This inhibition of osteoclastogenesis could be
rescued by overexpressing TRAF6 in precursor cells, indicating that
TRAF6 is the target critical for the IFNG action. Furthermore,
Takayanagi et al. (2000) provided evidence that the accelerated
degradation of TRAF6 requires both its ubiquitination, which is
initiated by RANKL, and IFNG-induced activation of the
ubiquitin-proteasome system. Takayanagi et al. (2000) concluded that
their study showed that there is crosstalk between the tumor necrosis
factor and IFN families of cytokines, through which IFNG provides a
negative link between T-cell activation and bone resorption.

Takatsuna et al. (2003) found that mouse Tifa (609028) bound Traf6
directly, and they presented evidence that TIFA is involved in TRAF6
activation of NFKB and JNK. Ea et al. (2004) showed that human TIFA
induced the oligomerization and polyubiquitination of TRAF6, leading to
activation of TAK1 and IKK.

Using a yeast 2-hybrid assay, Wooff et al. (2004) found that mouse Traf6
interacted with human UBC13, but not with human MMS2 (UBE2V2; 603001) or
UEV1A (UBE2V1). Mutation analysis revealed that the N-terminal RING
finger and zinc finger domains of Traf6 were necessary and sufficient
for the interaction. These domains also mediated Traf6 self-association.

Akiyama et al. (2005) demonstrated that deficiency in TRAF6 results in
disorganized distribution of medullary thymic epithelial cells (TECs)
and the absence of mature medullary TECs. Engraftment of thymic stroma
of Traf6-null embryos into athymic nude mice induced autoimmunity. Thus,
Akiyama et al. (2005) concluded that TRAF6 directs the development of
thymic stroma and represents a critical point of regulation for
self-tolerance and autoimmunity.

Bai et al. (2005) found that Fhl2 (602633) inhibited association of
Traf6 with Rank in mouse osteoclast precursors. Consequently, Fhl2
reduced Traf6-induced NF-kappa-B activity and Rank signaling, delaying
Rankl-induced osteoclastogenesis.

Bai et al. (2008) found that Traf6 interacted with the transcription
factor Runx1 (151385) in mouse osteoclast nuclei. Fhl2 increased the
nuclear abundance of Traf6 in transfected cells and interacted with
nuclear Traf6 and Runx1. Fhl2 did not interact with Runx1 in the absence
of Traf6. The Traf6-Runx1-Fhl2 complex bound Runx1 recognition sequences
in the Fhl2 promoter and induced Fhl2 expression. Traf6 also reduced
Fhl2 content via polyubiquitination of Fhl2, followed by Fhl2
proteasomal degradation.

To dissect biochemically Toll-like receptor signaling, Hacker et al.
(2006) established a system for isolating signaling complexes assembled
by dimerized adaptors. Using MyD88 (602170) as a prototypic adaptor,
they identified TRAF3 (601896) as a new component of Toll/interleukin-1
receptor signaling complexes that is recruited along with TRAF6. Using
myeloid cells from Traf3- and Traf6-deficient mice, Hacker et al. (2006)
demonstrated that TRAF3 is essential for the induction of type I
interferons and the antiinflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL10;
124092), but is dispensable for expression of proinflammatory cytokines.
In fact, Traf3-deficient cells overproduced proinflammatory cytokines
owing to defective IL10 production. Despite their structural similarity,
the functions of TRAF3 and TRAF6 are largely distinct. TRAF3 is also
recruited to the adaptor TRIF (607601) and is required for marshalling
the protein kinase TBK1 (604834) into Toll/interleukin-1 receptor
signaling complexes, thereby explaining its unique role in activation of
the interferon response.

Pearce et al. (2009) demonstrated that TRAF6 regulates CD8 (see 186910)
memory T cell development after infection by modulating fatty acid
metabolism. They showed that mice with a T cell-specific deletion of
TRAF6 mounted robust CD8 antigen-specific effector T cell responses, but
had a profound defect in their ability to generate memory T cells that
was characterized by the disappearance of antigen-specific cells in the
weeks after primary immunization. Microarray analysis revealed that
TRAF6-deficient CD8 T cells exhibited altered expression of genes that
regulate fatty acid metabolism. Consistent with this, activated CD8 T
cells lacking TRAF6 displayed defective AMP-activated kinase activation
and mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (FAO) in response to growth
factor withdrawal. Administration of the antidiabetic drug metformin
restored FAO and CD8 memory T cell generation in the absence of TRAF6.
This treatment also increased CD8 memory T cells in wildtype mice, and
consequently was able to considerably improve the efficacy of an
experimental anticancer vaccine.

Yang et al. (2009) found that the protein kinase Akt (164730) undergoes
lysine-63 chain ubiquitination, which is important for Akt membrane
localization and phosphorylation. TRAF6 was found to be a direct E3
ligase for Akt and was essential for Akt ubiquitination, membrane
recruitment, and phosphorylation upon growth factor stimulation. The
human cancer-associated Akt mutant (164730.0001) displayed an increase
in Akt ubiquitination, in turn contributing to the enhancement of Akt
membrane localization and phosphorylation. Thus, Yang et al. (2009)
concluded that Akt ubiquitination is an important step for oncogenic Akt
activation.

Xia et al. (2009) found that unanchored polyubiquitin chains synthesized
by TRAF6 and UBCH5C (602963) activate the IKK (see 600664) complex.
Disassembly of the polyubiquitin chains by deubiquitination enzymes
prevented TAK1 (602614) and IKK activation. Xia et al. (2009) concluded
that unanchored polyubiquitin chains directly activate TAK1 and IKK,
suggesting a new mechanism of protein kinase regulation.

Shembade et al. (2010) showed that A20 (191163) inhibits the E3 ligase
activities of TRAF6, TRAF2 (601895), and cIAP1 (601712) by antagonizing
interactions with E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes UBC13 (603679) and
UBCH5C. A20, together with the regulatory molecule TAX1BP1 (605326),
interacted with UBC13 and UBCH5C and triggered their ubiquitination and
proteasome-dependent degradation. These findings suggested a mechanism
of A20 action in the inhibition of inflammatory signaling pathways.

West et al. (2011) demonstrated that engagement of a subset of Toll-like
receptors (TLR1, 601194; TLR2, 603028; and TLR4, 603030) results in the
recruitment of mitochondria to macrophage phagosomes and augments
mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mROS) production. This response
involves translocation of a TLR signaling adaptor, TRAF6, to
mitochondria, where it engages the protein ECSIT (608388), which is
implicated in mitochondrial respiratory chain assembly. Interaction with
TRAF6 leads to ECSIT ubiquitination and enrichment at the mitochondrial
periphery, resulting in increased mitochondrial and cellular ROS
generation. ECSIT- and TRAF6-depleted macrophages have decreased levels
of TLR-induced ROS and are significantly impaired in their ability to
kill intracellular bacteria. Additionally, reducing macrophage mROS
levels by expressing catalase (115500) in mitochondria results in
defective bacterial killing, confirming the role of mROS in bactericidal
activity. West et al. (2011) concluded that their results revealed a
novel pathway linking innate immune signaling to mitochondria,
implicated mROS as an important component of antibacterial responses,
and further established mitochondria as hubs for innate immune
signaling.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Ye et al. (2002) reported the crystal structures of TRAF6, alone and in
complex with TRAF6-binding peptides from CD40 and TRANCER (RANK),
members of the TNFR superfamily, to gain insight into the mechanism by
which TRAF6 mediates several signaling cascades. A 40-degree difference
in the directions of the bound peptides in TRAF6 and TRAF2 showed that
there are marked structural differences between receptor recognition by
TRAF6 and other TRAFs. The structural determinant of the peptide-TRAF6
interaction revealed a Pro-X-Glu-X-X-(aromatic/acidic residue)
TRAF6-binding motif, which is present not only in CD40 and RANK but also
in the 3 IRAK adaptor kinases for IL1R/Toll-like receptor signaling (see
604459). Cell-permeable peptides with the TRAF6-binding motif inhibited
TRAF6 signaling, which indicated their potential as therapeutic
modulators. Ye et al. (2002) concluded that their studies identified a
universal mechanism by which TRAF6 regulates several signaling cascades
in adaptive immunity, innate immunity, and bone homeostasis.

One of the E3 ligases responsible for K63-linked NEMO polyubiquitination
is TRAF6, which participates in several signaling pathways controlling
immunity, osteoclastogenesis, skin development, and brain function.
Gautheron et al. (2010) determined that a site at the N terminus of NEMO
(300248) binds the coiled-coil domain of TRAF6 and apparently works in
concert with NEMO's ubiquitin-binding domain to provide a dual mode of
TRAF6 recognition. The E57K NEMO mutation, found in a mild form of
incontinentia pigmenti (308300), resulted in impaired TRAF6 binding and
IL1-beta (147720) signaling. In contrast, activation of NF-kappa-B by
TNF-alpha was not affected. The authors concluded that the NEMO-TRAF6
interaction has physiologic relevance.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the TRAF6
gene to chromosome 11 (TMAP WI-17696).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In members of 2 Maltese pedigrees with osteoporosis mapping to
chromosome 11q12 (BMND8; 611738), Vidal et al. (2007) sequenced the
TRAF6 gene and identified 3 noncoding sequence variants, including a
-721A-T transversion in the promoter region of the gene that was present
in 3 affected members of 1 family. The promoter variant was also found
in heterozygosity in 3 of 82 unrelated postmenopausal women and in 2 of
350 control chromosomes from the general population.

ANIMAL MODEL

TRAFs are essential to perinatal and postnatal survival. Lomaga et al.
(1999) reported that mice deficient in Traf6 exhibited osteopetrosis
with defects in bone remodeling and tooth eruption due to impaired
tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP; see 171640)-positive
osteoclast function. The authors noted that osteoclasts are absent in
Opgl (602642)-deficient mice. In Traf6 knockout mice, however,
osteoclasts were present but lacked contact with bone surfaces and were
unable to resorb significant amounts of bone. Unlike other TRAFs, TRAF6
is required for IL1 signaling. IL1B (147720) stimulation failed to
induce NFKB or JNK/SAPK activation in cells from Traf6 -/- mice.
Inducible nitrous oxide synthase (INOS; see 163729) production in
response to TNF plus IFNG, but not to IL1, was intact in Traf6-deficient
mice. B lymphocytes from knockout mice exposed to anti-CD40 (see 109535)
or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) failed to proliferate or to activate NFKB.
T-lymphocyte proliferation was unaffected by Traf6 deletion.

Naito et al. (2002) reported that Traf6 -/- mice had defective
development of epidermal appendices, including guard hair follicles,
sweat glands, sebaceous glands of back skin, and modified sebaceous
glands, such as meibomian, anal, and preputial glands. Excluding the
sebaceous gland impairment, these abnormal phenotypes are identical to
those observed in 'Tabby' (Ta), 'downless' (dl), and 'crinkled' (cr)
mice, which are models of hypohidrotic (anhidrotic) ectodermal dysplasia
(224900) in humans resulting from mutations in the EDA1 (305100), EDAR
(604095), and EDARADD (606603) genes, respectively. Beta-catenin
(CTNNB1; 116806) and mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1
(MADCAM1; 102670), an early marker of developing guard-hair follicles,
were absent in the skin of Traf6-deficient embryos. Thus, TRAF6 is
essential for development of epidermal appendices. Traf6 did not
associate with the cytoplasmic tail of the dl protein, which, when
mutated, results in hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia. However, Traf6
associated with XEDAR (300276) and TAJ (606122), which are EDAR-related
members of the TNFR superfamily that are expressed at high levels in
epidermal appendices. The results suggested that TRAF6 may transduce
signals emanating from XEDAR or TAJ that are associated with development
of epidermal appendices.

Ohazama et al. (2004) found that Traf6 mutant mice had abnormalities in
molar teeth that were similar to but more severe than those produced by
mutations in Eda signaling molecules. Sections of first mandibular
molars revealed a major reduction in cusp shape and height compared with
wildtype, demonstrating that Traf6 plays an essential role in cusp
formation.

King et al. (2006) generated healthy mice lacking Traf6 specifically in
T lymphocytes. At 10 to 12 weeks of age, these mice developed
splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy, with increased B-cell and Cd4
(186940)-positive T-cell numbers, but fewer Cd8 (see 186910)-positive T
cells. Histopathologic analysis showed systemic inflammation in multiple
organs of mutant mice. Cd4-positive/Cd25 (IL2RA; 147730)-positive
regulatory T cells were present and appeared functional in mutant mice,
but proliferation of Traf6 -/- T cells could not be suppressed by
wildtype or mutant regulatory T cells, suggesting the presence of a
responder T-cell mechanism necessary to render T cells susceptible to
regulation. The resistance to suppression was accompanied by
hyperactivation of PI3K (see 601232)-dependent pathways. King et al.
(2006) concluded that TRAF6 is important in maintaining the balance
between immune activation and suppression.

607582	TITLE *607582 SOLUTE CARRIER FAMILY 22 (ORGANIC ANION TRANSPORTER), MEMBER 6; SLC22A6
;;ORGANIC ANION TRANSPORTER 1; OAT1;;
PARA-AMINOHIPPURATE TRANSPORTER; PAHT;;
PAH TRANSPORTER
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SLC22A6 is a member of a family of organic anion transporters. Within
renal proximal tubules, these transporters mediate the secretion of
endogenous and exogenous metabolites, including many clinically
important drugs.

CLONING

Using the sequence of the rat PAH transporter as query, Lu et al. (1999)
identified fetal brain ESTs for SLC22A6, which they designated PAHT.
They obtained the full-length clone by RT-PCR of adult kidney mRNA. The
deduced 550-amino acid protein contains 12 transmembrane spans, 4
protein kinase C (see 176960) phosphorylation sites, 4 protein kinase A
(see 176911) phosphorylation sites, and 5 putative N-glycosylation
sites. SLC22A6 shares 87% identity with rat Oat1, 85% identity with
mouse Oat1, and 32% and 29% identity with the cation transporters OCT1
(SLC22A1; 602607) and OCTN2 (SLC22A5; 603377), respectively. Northern
blot analysis of several tissues detected a 2.4-kb transcript only in
kidney.

Race et al. (1999) cloned SLC22A6, which they designated OAT1, from a
kidney cDNA library. The deduced protein has a calculated molecular mass
of 60.3 kD. SLC22A6 has 12 transmembrane-spanning domains that are
separated by 5 intracellular loops and 6 extracellular loops; the N and
C termini are intracellular. SLC22A6 also contains 3 motifs conserved in
the amphiphilic solute facilitator family of proteins. Northern blot
analysis detected a 2.4-kb transcript expressed strongly in kidney and
weakly in brain.

Bahn et al. (2000) identified a splice variant of OAT1 that has a 132-bp
in-frame deletion, resulting in the loss of transmembrane domain 11 and
half of transmembrane domain 12.

GENE FUNCTION

By analyzing PAHT transiently expressed in HeLa cells, Lu et al. (1999)
demonstrated time-dependent and saturable radiolabeled PAH uptake.
Preincubation with unlabeled alpha-ketoglutaric or with glutaric acid
stimulated PAH uptake, and preincubation with unlabeled PAH stimulated
uptake of radiolabeled alpha-ketoglutarate, consistent with
PAH/alpha-ketoglutarate exchange. Transport of radiolabeled PAH was
inhibited by furosemide, indomethacin, probenecid, and
alpha-ketoglutarate. It was not inhibited by prostaglandins or
methotrexate, indicating substrate specificity that is different than
that of rat Oat1. PAH uptake was also inhibited by phorbol esters in a
dose- and time-dependent fashion, indicating inhibition of transport by
phosphorylation through protein kinase C.

Race et al. (1999) demonstrated PAH uptake in Xenopus oocytes injected
with OAT1 mRNA. PAH uptake was dependent on chloride. Inhibitor studies
gave results similar to those reported by Lu et al. (1999).

GENE STRUCTURE

Bahn et al. (2000) determined that the SLC22A6 gene contains 10 exons
and spans 8.2 kb. The promoter region contains TATA and CCAAT boxes, a
thyroid hormone-binding site, and putative binding sites for nuclear
factor kappa-B (NFKB; see 164011), AP2 (107580), C/EBP-alpha (116897),
and SP1 (189906).

MAPPING

Using somatic cell hybrid analysis, Lu et al. (1999) mapped the SLC22A6
gene to chromosome 11. By radiation hybrid analysis, Race et al. (1999)
mapped the SLC22A6 gene to chromosome 11. Bahn et al. (2000) mapped the
SLC22A6 gene to chromosome 11q13.1-q13.2 using FISH.

611980	TITLE *611980 MITOCHONDRIAL RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN S17; MRPS17
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Mitochondria have their own translation system for production of 13
proteins essential for oxidative phosphorylation. MRPS17 is 1 of more
than 70 protein components of mitochondrial ribosomes that are encoded
by the nuclear genome (Kenmochi et al., 2001).

CLONING

By proteolytic digestion of whole bovine 28S subunits, followed by
peptide analysis and EST database analysis, Koc et al. (2001) identified
full-length human MRPS17. The deduced 130-amino acid MRPS17 protein has
a calculated molecular mass of 14.5 kD. Removal of a predicted 20-amino
acid N-terminal mitochondrial localization signal results in a mature
12.4-kD protein. Koc et al. (2001) identified MRPS17 orthologs in mouse,
Drosophila, C. elegans, yeast, and E. coli. Highest conservation is in
the N-terminal and central regions of MRPS17 orthologs. Mouse and human
MRPS17 share 84.2% amino acid identity.

MAPPING

Using radiation hybrid analysis and analysis of an integrated BAC-STS
map, Kenmochi et al. (2001) mapped the MRPS17 gene to chromosome
7p11-q11.21. By genomic sequence analysis, Zhang and Gerstein (2003)
identified 9 MRPS17 pseudogenes scattered throughout the genome.

146740	TITLE *146740 Fc FRAGMENT OF IgG, LOW AFFINITY IIIa, RECEPTOR FOR; FCGR3A
;;IMMUNOGLOBULIN G Fc RECEPTOR III-2;;
FCRIII-2;;
CD16A
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The Fc receptor with low affinity for IgG (FCGR3, or CD16) is encoded by
2 nearly identical genes, FCGR3A and FCGR3B (610665), resulting in
tissue-specific expression of alternative membrane-anchored isoforms.
FCGR3A encodes a transmembrane protein expressed on activated
monocytes/macrophages, natural killer (NK) cells, and a subset of T
cells. In contrast, FCGR3B encodes a glycosylphosphatidylinositol
(GPI)-anchored protein that is expressed constitutively by neutrophils
and after gamma-interferon (IFNG; 147570) stimulation by eosinophils
(summary by Gessner et al., 1995).

CLONING

By Western blot and flow cytometric analyses, Ravetch and Perussia
(1989) demonstrated differential expression of FCGR3 on
polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) and NK cells. The glycoprotein on
NK cells (FCGR3A) had a molecular mass 6 to 10 kD larger than that on
neutrophils (FCGR3B) and was resistant to phosphatidylinositol-specific
phospholipase C. Transcripts derived from FCGR3A and FCGR3B in NK cells
and PMNs, respectively, have multiple single nucleotide differences,
including 1 that converts a termination codon to a codon encoding arg,
thereby extending the cytoplasmic domain by 21 amino acids and
introducing a transmembrane anchor for FCGR3A in NK cells. The deduced
FCGR3A protein contains 254 amino acids, whereas the deduced FCGR3B
protein contains 233 amino acids. Ravetch and Perussia (1989) concluded
that cell type-specific expression of 2 genes encoding alternative FCGR3
proteins has a significant effect on the biologic functions of the
molecules.

GENE STRUCTURE

Gessner et al. (1995) isolated and sequenced genomic clones of FCGR3A
and FCGR3B, located their transcription initiation sites, identified the
different organizations of their 5-prime regions, and demonstrated 4
distinct classes of FCGR3A transcripts compared with a single class of
FCGR3B transcripts. The gene promoters displayed different
tissue-specific transcriptional activities reflecting expression of
FCGR3A in NK cells and FCGR3B in neutrophils.

MAPPING

Le Coniat et al. (1990) mapped the FCGR3A gene to chromosome 1q23 by in
situ hybridization.

GENE FUNCTION

Anderson et al. (1990) concluded that CD16 is included in the zeta
natural killer cell receptor complex (CD3Z; 186780).

Some gamma-delta T cells (see TCRG, 186970 and TCRD, 186810) express
CD16. Using flow cytometric analysis, Bodman-Smith et al. (2000)
examined the relative proportions of CD16+ gamma-delta T cells in the
blood and synovial fluid of rheumatoid arthritis (RA; 180300) patients
and the blood of control subjects. There was a significant reduction in
CD16+ gamma-delta T cells in synovial fluid compared with the
circulation. Mitogenic stimulation of circulating gamma-delta T cells
resulted in an increased expression of the HLA-DR activation marker and
a concomitant time-dependent decrease in the expression of CD16.
Bodman-Smith et al. (2000) concluded that CD16 expression is lost in the
synovial compartment as a result of activation.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

On the natural killer (NK) cells of a 3-year-old boy who suffered from
recurrent viral respiratory tract infections since birth, de Vries et
al. (1996) found an unusual CD16 phenotype. The child also had severe
clinical problems with BCG vaccination and after Epstein-Barr virus and
varicella-zoster virus infections. His peripheral blood lymphocytes
contained a normal percentage and absolute number of CD3(-)CD7(+) cells,
which were positively stained with CD16 monoclonal antibodies. FCGR3
expression on granulocytes appeared to be normal. Sequence analysis of
the FCGR3A gene, encoding CD16 on NK cells and macrophages, showed a
T-to-A nucleotide substitution at position 230 on both alleles,
predicting a leucine to histidine amino acid change at position 48
(146740.0002).

By cloning and sequencing FCGR3A cDNA from NK cells and macrophages of a
heterozygous donor, de Haas et al. (1996) identified a 230T-G SNP that
resulted in a leu48-to-arg (L48R) substitution in the first
extracellular Ig-like domain and caused a higher electrophoretic
mobility of deglycosylated FCGR3A. PCR and restriction analysis
identified a 230T-A SNP, resulting in a leu48-to-his (L48H)
substitution, in another donor. Genotype analysis revealed a gene
frequency of 86% for 230T (L48), 6% for 230G (R48), and 8% for 230A
(H48) in 93 FCGR3B-positive individuals. In contrast, the frequency of
the 230G allele was significantly higher in 12 FCGR3B-deficient donors.
The H48 and R48 variants exhibited a higher binding capacity for IgG1,
IgG3, and IgG4 than did the common L48 variant. De Haas et al. (1996)
concluded that SNPs at position 230 of FCGR3A influence IgG binding, as
well as reactivity of CD16 monoclonal antibodies.

Koene et al. (1997) used PCR-based restriction analysis to genotype 87
donors for a 559T-G SNP in FCGR3A that results in a phe158-to-val
(F158V) substitution. They found gene frequencies of 57% and 43% for
F158 and V158, respectively. F158 was linked to L48, and V158 was linked
to R48 or H48. Through functional analysis, Koene et al. (1997)
determined that the previously identified differences in IgG binding
among the 3 FCGR3A variants at position 48 are a consequence of the
linked polymorphism at position 158.

Among 1,115 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA; 180300) and 654
controls, Robinson et al. (2012) found no significant association
between FCGR3A copy number and disease.

Although nearly all adults have been exposed to herpes simplex virus
(HSV)-1, the clinical course of infection varies remarkably. By
analyzing the contribution of gene families on chromosomes 1, 6, 12, and
19 to susceptibility to HSV-1 infection in 302 individuals, Moraru et
al. (2012) identified no specific susceptibility locus. However, they
found that the risk of suffering clinical HSV-1 infection was modified
by MHC class I allotypes, HLA-C1 (142840) interaction with KIR2DL2
(604937), and the phe/val polymorphism at codon 158 of CD16A.

EVOLUTION

By determining the nature and rate of copy number variation (CNV)
mutation and investigating the global variation of disease-associated
variation at the FCGR locus, Machado et al. (2012) determined that CNV
of the FCGR3 genes is mediated by recurrent nonallelic homologous
recombination between the 2 segmental duplications that carry FCGR3A and
FCGR3B. They showed that pathogen richness, particularly helminth
pathogens, is likely to have influenced the patterns of variation in
FCGRs in humans. Machado et al. (2012) proposed that alterations to IgG
binding in the context of helminth infection have driven positive
selection in FCGR among different mammalian species, linking
evolutionary pressure of helminth infection with autoimmune disease via
adaptation at the genetic level. This model supports the 'hygiene
hypothesis,' which states that in the absence of chronic helminth
infection in modern populations, previously selected alleles respond to
immune system challenges differently and therefore may alter
susceptibility to autoimmune disease.

ANIMAL MODEL

Pinheiro da Silva et al. (2007) found that Fcrg (FCER1G; 147139) -/-
mice showed reduced mortality in an acute peritonitis model caused by
cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) compared with wildtype mice. The
reduced mortality in Fcrg -/- mice was associated with lower serum and
peritoneal Tnf (191160) and significantly increased capacity of
neutrophils and macrophages to phagocytose E. coli. Fcgr3 -/- mice also
had reduced sepsis after CLP. Fcgr3 bound E. coli, inducing Fcrg
phosphorylation, recruitment of tyrosine phosphatase Shp1 (PTPN6;
176883), and dephosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K;
see 171834). Decreased Pi3k activity inhibited E. coli phagocytosis and
increased Tnf production through Tlr4 (603030). Confocal microscopy
demonstrated negative regulation of Marco (604870) by Fcrg. Interaction
of E. coli with Fcgr3 induced recruitment of Shp1 to Marco and inhibited
E. coli phagocytosis. Pinheiro da Silva et al. (2007) concluded that
binding of E. coli to FCGR3 triggers an inhibitory FCRG pathway that
impairs MARCO-mediated bacterial clearance and activates TNF secretion.

VIRAL INFECTIONS, RECURRENT, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
FCGR3A, LEU48HIS

In a 3-year-old boy who had suffered from recurrent viral respiratory
tract infections since birth, de Vries et al. (1996) found an unusual
CD16 phenotype on the natural killer (NK) cells. Sequence analysis of
the IGFR3 gene showed a T-to-A nucleotide substitution at position 230
on both alleles, predicting a leucine-to-histidine amino acid change at
position 48 in the first extracellular Ig-like domain of the FCGR3A
protein. The child had also had severe problems with BCG vaccination and
with Epstein-Barr virus and varicella-zoster virus infections. The
clinical pattern was considered compatible with an in vivo dysfunction
of NK cells. Only 1 patient with absolute NK cell deficiency had been
previously described. Biron et al. (1989) reported the case of an
adolescent with recurrent life-threatening herpesvirus infections, who
completely lacked CD16 and/or CD56 positive cells in vivo and
NK-activity in vitro. In a note added in proof, de Vries et al. (1996)
called attention to the case of homozygosity for a IGFR3 mutation
reported by Jawahar et al. (1996).

171500	TITLE *171500 ACID PHOSPHATASE 1, SOLUBLE; ACP1
;;PHOSPHATASE, ACID, OF ERYTHROCYTE
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Wo et al. (1992) cloned genes encoding 2 low molecular weight
phosphotyrosyl protein phosphatases from a human placenta cDNA library.
They were found to have identical nucleotide sequences, with the
exception of a 108-bp segment in the middle of the open reading frame.
From further studies they concluded that the 2 represent the fast and
slow electrophoretic forms of red cell acid phosphatase and that this
enzyme is not unique to the red cell but instead is expressed in all
human tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

Sensabaugh and Golden (1978) showed that ACP1 is inhibited by folic acid
and various folates, and that the inhibition is phenotype dependent:
ACP1(C) more than ACP1(A) more than ACP1(B). This explains elevation of
ACP levels in red cells of patients with megaloblastic anemia and also
variation in incidence and severity of favism (134700) in G6PD
(305900)-deficient persons.

Swallow et al. (1973) showed that 'red cell' acid phosphatase is not
limited to erythrocytes but can be demonstrated in other tissues,
including cultured fibroblasts and lymphoblastoid cells where there is
no possibility of contamination by blood.

MAPPING

Weitkamp et al. (1969) presented data suggesting that the acid
phosphatase locus may be on chromosome 2. Renwick (1971) presented an
analysis of the Weitkamp data supporting assignment to chromosome 2.

Ferguson-Smith et al. (1973) presented deletion mapping evidence that
the acid phosphatase locus is on the distal end of the short arm of
chromosome 2, somewhere between 2p23 and 2pter. A child lacking this
segment was of phenotype B whereas the father and mother were homozygous
phenotype B and A, respectively.

Hulten et al. (1966) described a family in which studies of a reciprocal
translocation involving chromosome 2 suggested that the Kidd locus may
be on one of the involved chromosomes. Cell hybrid studies confirmed the
localization of acid phosphatase-1 on chromosome 2 (Povey et al., 1974).

Chu et al. (1975) presented cell-hybrid evidence for synteny of
gal-1-PT, acid phosphatase, MDH1 (154200), and gal-plus-activator (GLAT;
137030) and for assignment to chromosome 2. Junien et al. (1979)
assigned the ACP1 locus to 2p25.

Larson et al. (1982) studied 4 patients who had inherited an unbalanced
form of a familial reciprocal translocation, t(2;10)(p24;q26), giving
them partial duplication of 2p. Increased levels of acid phosphatase
indicated that ACP1 is located in the 2p24-2pter region and that MDH is
not. The previous inconsistency of the SRO (smallest region of overlap)
was now resolved; ACP1 is at 2p25.

By deletion mapping, Beemer et al. (1983) concluded that ACP1 is located
at 2p25 whereas MDH is closer to the centromere, i.e., in 2p25-p23. They
pointed to the report of Larson et al. (1982) as confirming their
findings.

Wakita et al. (1985) presented evidence in support of location of ACP1
at 2p25. In a patient with duplication of 2p25.3-p25.1, ACP activity was
1.4 times the mean value for normal persons.

Lothe et al. (1986) found that ACP1 is very closely linked (theta =
0.01) to a RFLP called D2S1 that maps to 2pter-p23. Siciliano et al.
(1987) and Thompson et al. (1987) resolved earlier ambiguity of the ACP1
assignment (2p23 or 2p25) by demonstrating in hybrid cells with
rearranged chromosomes that ACP1 is located at band 2p23, proximal to
MDH1 (154200). ACP1 is seemingly remote from APOB (107730); linkage
studies demonstrate no close linkage (Berg, 1987). There may be a large
amount of recombination in that region of 2p.

Wo et al. (1992) examined a human chromosome 2-specific library and
demonstrated that the sequences encoding 2 low molecular weight
phosphotyrosyl protein phosphatases that they were studying are located
on chromosome 2.

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Bryson et al. (1995) mapped the
ACP1 gene to the distal portion of 2p25.

GENE STRUCTURE

Bryson et al. (1995) showed that ACP1 contains 7 exons spanning 18 kb
with a GC-rich promoter. Alternative splicing of exons 3 and 4 was shown
to account for 2 different isozymes.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Hopkinson et al. (1963) described a new human polymorphism involving
erythrocyte acid phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.2) as demonstrated in starch-gel
electrophoresis. Three alleles, P(a), P(b) and P(c), were thought to be
involved, their frequency being estimated to be 0.35, 0.60 and 0.05,
respectively. Another rare allele, P(r), was described by Giblett and
Scott (1965).

Dissing et al. (1991) concluded that 2 electrophoretically distinct
isozymes, f and s, which are produced in allele-specific ratios and are
associated with each of the 3 major alleles, are generated by
alternative splicing of the primary RNA transcript.

Mohrenweiser and Novotny (1982) described a low activity variant of ACP1
(GUA-1) that is frequent (gene frequency of 0.132) in Guaymi Indians of
Central America. This variant has an electrophoretic mobility similar to
the common B- and C-type variants, but individuals of the GUA-1
phenotype have a level of enzyme activity only 27% of the activity
expected for the ACP1C variant. Red cells of persons with the GUA-1
phenotype had increased basal levels of the flavoenzyme glutathione
reductase and a larger fraction of the glutathione reductase protein in
the form of the holoenzyme, indicating increased levels of flavin
adenine dinucleotide in the red cells of these persons. The finding was
consistent with the suggestion that ACP1 has a physiologic function as a
flavin mononucleotide phosphatase. This function could regulate the
intracellular concentrations of flavin coenzymes and, ultimately, of
flavoenzymes, and could be the mechanism for the association between
ACP1 type and certain disease states.

Miller et al. (1987) gave a general review of the electrophoretic
variants of red blood cell acid phosphatase. Arnaud et al. (1989)
identified in Czechoslovakia a rare variant of ACP1, called ACP1*KUK.
Arnaud et al. (1992) reported kinetic and thermodynamic characteristics
of the KUK variant.

Data on gene frequencies of allelic variants were tabulated by
Roychoudhury and Nei (1988).

HISTORY

Van Cong and Moullec (1971) suggested that the acid phosphatase and
Lewis (111100) loci are linked, but Chautard-Freire-Maia (1974) could
not corroborate this linkage.

Mace and Robson (1974) and Weitkamp et al. (1975) presented data
consistent with loose linkage of red cell acid phosphatase and MNS blood
group (111300); these loci were later shown to be on separate
chromosomes (2 and 4, respectively). Mace and Robson (1974) found also a
hint of linkage between ACP and Kidd blood group (Jk; 111000); the Kidd
gene (SLC14A1; 613868) was subsequently shown to be on chromosome 18,
not 2.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
ACID PHOSPHATASE 1, SOLUBLE, A/B POLYMORPHISM OF
ACP1, ARG105GLN

Dissing and Johnsen (1992) provided evidence for the molecular basis of
the 3 common alleles in Caucasians: ACP1*A, ACP1*B, and ACP1*C, which
give rise to 6 phenotypes (A, B, C, AB, AC, and BC). Each allele encodes
2 isozymes, f and s, which show fast and slow electrophoretic mobility,
respectively. The f and s isozymes are produced in allele-specific
ratios: 2:1 for Af and As, 4:1 for Bf and Bs, and 1:4 for Cf and Cs,
respectively. The f and s isozymes appear to be generated by alternative
splicing of exons in the primary RNA transcript. The coding portions of
the ACP1*B and ACP1*C alleles are identical; the only difference at the
protein level is the ratio of f and s isozyme. Thus, a difference in the
splicing mechanism presumably accounts for the difference in ratio. Af
and As differ from the Bf and Bs isozymes by a single substitution at
residue 105: arg and gln, respectively. These observations explain the
electrophoretic identity of the B and C isozyme pairs.

162096	TITLE *162096 MIDKINE; MDK
;;MIDGESTATION AND KIDNEY; MK;;
NEURITE GROWTH-PROMOTING FACTOR 2, FORMERLY; NEGF2, FORMERLY
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Midkine is a retinoic acid-responsive, heparin-binding growth factor
expressed in various cell types during embryogenesis. It promotes
angiogenesis, cell growth, and cell migration. Midkine is also expressed
in several carcinomas, suggesting that it may play a role in
tumorigenesis, perhaps through its effects on angiogenesis (summary by
Reynolds et al., 2004).

CLONING

Using mouse Mk to screen a midgestation human embryonic kidney cDNA
library, followed by screening a placenta genomic library, Tsutsui et
al. (1991) cloned human MDK, which they called MK. The deduced 121-amino
acid protein has a signal sequence and shares 87% identity with mouse
Mk. Orthologs of MK were detected in rat, cow, and chicken. The chicken
ortholog, Rihb, is a retinoic acid-induced heparin-binding protein. MK
shares about 50% amino acid homology with the human heparin-binding
protein pleiotrophin (PTN; 162095), with highest conservation in the
central part of the molecule and complete conservation of cysteine
residues. Northern blot analysis detected a transcript of about 1 kb in
adult human kidney and PA1 human teratocarcinoma cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Reynolds et al. (2004) found that hypoxia induced midkine expression in
alveolar epithelial cells and pulmonary vasculature in a strain of mice
sensitive to hypoxia. Hypoxia induced expression of both HIF1-alpha
(603348) and midkine in human placental adenocarcinoma, mouse fetal lung
mesenchyme, and human pulmonary adenocarcinoma cell lines. HIF1-alpha
induced midkine expression via regulatory elements in the mouse midkine
promoter. Chronic expression of midkine during embryonic development in
transgenic mice resulted in pulmonary arterial remodeling and
muscularization, but only during the postnatal phase of lung
development. In fetal mouse lung mesenchymal cells and transgenic mice,
midkine upregulated expression of myocardin (MYOCD; 606127), a regulator
of smooth muscle cell differentiation.

Intraperitoneal adhesions between organs or between organs and
peritoneal walls occur in more than 90% of cases involving major
abdominal operations. Using a model of postoperative adhesions and
Mk-null mice, Inoh et al. (2004) showed that midkine was fundamentally
involved in the formation of intraperitoneal adhesions, at least partly
by promoting migration of macrophages and neutrophils to the omentum.

Hobo et al. (2009) found that 5/6 nephrectomy in mice, a model of
chronic kidney disease, induced expression of midkine in lung, leading
to elevated angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE; 106180) activity and
plasma angiotensin II (106150) levels and subsequent hypertension.
Exposure to midkine enhanced ACE expression in primary cultured human
lung microvascular endothelial cells. Oxidative stress may have
contributed to midkine expression, since 5/6 nephrectomy induced
expression of NADH/NADPH oxidase-1 (NOX1; 300225), Nox2 (CYBB; 300481),
and Nox4 (605261). Furthermore, an antioxidant reduced midkine
expression and plasma angiotensin II levels and ameliorated hypertension
in 5/6 nephrectomized mice.

GENE STRUCTURE

Uehara et al. (1992) determined that the MDK gene contains 4 exons. The
5-prime flanking region adjacent to the start site contains 5 GC boxes,
a steroid/thyroid hormone receptor-binding site, and an A/T-rich island,
but there is no obvious CAAT box. Further upstream there is a region
with high GC content. The mouse Mdk gene has a similar organization,
with conservation of exons and significant homology in the 5-prime
region adjacent to the start site. There are 3 additional regions of
homology between mouse and human MDK in the 5-prime UTR.

MAPPING

By study of somatic cell hybrids, Eddy et al. (1991) demonstrated that
the MDK gene segregates concordantly with chromosome 11 and, using cell
hybrids carrying translocations involving chromosome 11, they mapped the
gene regionally to 11p13-p11. Kaname et al. (1993) mapped the MDK gene
to human chromosome 11p11.2 by fluorescence in situ hybridization.
Simon-Chazottes et al. (1992) mapped the mouse Mdk gene to chromosome 2,
using an interspecific backcross panel and microsatellite polymorphisms
as markers. O'Hara et al. (1995) used somatic cell hybrid analysis and
interspecific backcross analysis, respectively, to map human Mdk to
chromosome 11p13-p11 and mouse Mdk to a syntenic region of mouse
chromosome 2. They also mapped an Mdk pseudogene to mouse chromosome 11.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using microarray analysis, Ezquerra et al. (2005) found that aortae of
Mk -/- mice showed elevated expression of renin (REN; 179820),
angiotensinogen (106150), angiotensin II receptor-1 (AGTR1; 106165), and
angiotensin II receptor-2 (AGTR2; 300034) and decreased expression of
Ace.
