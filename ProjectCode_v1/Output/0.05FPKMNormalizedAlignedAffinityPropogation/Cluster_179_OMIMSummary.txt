611692	TITLE *611692 ZINC FINGER- AND BTB DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 34; ZBTB34
;;KIAA1993
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database searching and EST assembly, Qi et al. (2006) identified a
member of the BTB/POZ protein family, designated ZBTB34, which had
previously been identified as KIAA1993 by Ohara et al. (2002). The
deduced ZBTB34 protein contains 504 amino acids with a BTB/POZ domain in
the N terminus and 3 C2H2 zinc fingers in the C terminus. Northern blot
and RT-PCR analyses demonstrated weak transcription in several tissues,
including heart, brain, thymus, skeletal muscle, small intestine,
kidney, liver, placenta, and peripheral blood. Immunofluorescence
studies localized the protein to the nucleus.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a Gal4 reporter system, Qi et al. (2006) showed that ZBTB34 could
repress transcription by 50 to 80%.

GENE STRUCTURE

Qi et al. (2006) determined that the ZBTB34 gene contains 2 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Qi et al. (2006) mapped the ZBTB34 gene to
chromosome 9q33.3.

614730	TITLE *614730 PHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL GLYCAN, CLASS O; PIGO
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Many proteins are anchored to cell surface membranes via a
glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) modification. PIGO is involved GPI
biosynthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and has a role in the
transfer of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) to the third mannose (Man3) of
the GPI core (Hong et al., 2000).

CLONING

Hong et al. (2000) cloned mouse Pigo from a testis cDNA library, and
they identified human PIGO by database analysis. The deduced 1,101-amino
acid mouse protein has a transmembrane domain near the N terminus,
followed by a hydrophilic region of about 400 amino acids and 15
transmembrane domains in the C-terminal half. The hydrophilic region
contains motifs conserved in various phosphodiesterases and nucleotide
pyrophosphatases. Pigo also has 2 potential N-glycosylation sites.
Western blot analysis of transfected and fractionated CHO cells revealed
that Pigo associated with ER membrane markers.

GENE FUNCTION

Hong et al. (2000) found that knockout of Pigo in F9 mouse embryonal
carcinoma cells reduced, but did not eliminate, surface expression of
Thy1 (188230), a protein that requires a GPI anchor for membrane
association. In contrast, knockout of Pigf (600153) completely
eliminated surface expression of Thy1. Knockout of either Pigo or Pigf
resulted in accumulation of the same major GPI intermediate lacking PE
on Man3, but different minor GPI intermediates. Protein pull-down assays
revealed that Pigo and Pigf interacted; however, much of Pigf did not
associate with Pigo. Expression of Pigo was much higher in the presence
than in the absence of Pigf, whereas Pigf was stable in the absence of
Pigo. Hong et al. (2000) concluded that PIGO is involved in, but not
essential for, GPI anchoring of proteins, whereas PIGF is essential for
it. They hypothesized that PIGF may have other partners for transferring
PE onto Man3, possibly resulting in a minor change in GPI structure.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hong et al. (2000) determined that the PIGO gene contains 10 exons.

MAPPING

Hong et al. (2000) reported that the PIGO gene maps to chromosome 9p13.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

By exome sequencing of 2 sisters with hyperphosphatasia with mental
retardation syndrome-2 (HPMRS2; 614749), Krawitz et al. (2012)
identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the PIGO gene
(614730.0001 and 614730.0002). Sequencing of this gene in 11 additional
patients with a similar disorder identified 1 patient who was compound
heterozygous for 2 mutations (614730.0001 and 614730.0003). In vitro
functional expression studies showed that the mutant proteins either
lacked or had decreased functional activity. PIGO-deficient CHO cell
lines had decreased cell surface placental alkaline phosphatase (ALP)
activity with increased secretion of ALP, which was rescued by
transfection with wildtype PIGO. The findings indicated that
hyperphosphatasia in the patients with PIGO mutations is a result of
release of ALP into the serum due to a defect in GPI anchoring of ALP to
the cell membrane.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HYPERPHOSPHATASIA WITH MENTAL RETARDATION SYNDROME 2
PIGO, LEU957PHE

In 2 sisters, born of unrelated British parents, with hyperphosphatasia
with mental retardation syndrome-2 (HPMRS2; 614749), Krawitz et al.
(2012) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the PIGO
gene: a 2869C-T transition resulting in a leu957-to-phe (L957F)
substitution, and a 1-bp duplication (2361dupC; 614730.0002), resulting
in a frameshift and premature termination (Thr788HisfsTer5). The
mutations were detected by whole-exome sequencing and confirmed by
Sanger sequencing. The L957F substitution occurs in a highly conserved
residue in the transmembrane domain. Each unaffected parent was
heterozygous for 1 of the mutations. Sequencing of the PIGO gene in 11
additional patients with a similar phenotype identified compound
heterozygous mutations in 1 patient: L957F and a G-to-A transition in
intron 8 (3069+5G-A; 614730.0003), resulting in the skipping of exon 9.
The splice site mutation was found in 1 of 5,379 controls. In vitro
functional expression studies demonstrated that the 2361dupC mutation
did not result in restoration of CD59 (107271) expression at the cell
surface of PIGO-deficient CHO cells, and that L957F induced only low
levels of CD59 expression in these cells. The mutant truncated protein
was expressed at high levels compared to wildtype, whereas the L957F
protein was expressed at decreased levels. PIGO-deficient CHO cell lines
had decreased cell surface placental alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity
with increased secretion of ALP, which was rescued by transfection with
wildtype PIGO. The findings indicated that hyperphosphatasia in the
patients with PIGO mutations is a result of release of ALP into the
serum due to a defect in glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchoring of
ALP to the cell membrane.

;;DOUBLE-STRANDED RNA-BINDING ZINC FINGER PROTEIN;;
JUST ANOTHER ZINC FINGER PROTEIN; JAZ
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Double-stranded (ds) RNA binding is frequently mediated by a 65-amino
acid motif, while other nuclear localization signals are required for
proteins to move selectively from the cytoplasm across the nuclear
envelope and into the nucleus. Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a mouse
NFS/N1.H7 cDNA library with dsRNA-dependent protein kinase PKR (176871)
as bait, followed by searching an EST database and 5-prime RACE of a
human placental library, Yang et al. (1999) obtained a cDNA encoding JAZ
(just another zinc finger protein). Sequence analysis predicted that the
294-amino acid JAZ protein, which is 89% homologous to the mouse
sequence, contains 4 homologous C2H2-type zinc finger domains that are
connected by unusually long helix-loop linker sequences beginning with
basic residues. Northern blot analysis of multiple mouse tissues
detected ubiquitous expression of a 3.6-kb transcript. Gel shift
analysis showed that JAZ binds preferentially to dsRNA or RNA/DNA
hybrids rather than dsDNA. Western blot analysis determined that JAZ is
expressed as a 36-kD nuclear protein. Immunofluorescence microscopy
demonstrated that JAZ localizes to the nucleus, primarily to the
nucleolus. Immunoblot and immunofluorescence analysis indicated that the
zinc finger domains and the linker length are both required for binding
to dsRNA and for nuclear localization. Exogenous overexpression of JAZ
induced apoptosis, which also required intact zinc fingers.

;;ACETYLCHOLINE RECEPTOR, MUSCLE, GAMMA SUBUNIT; ACHRG
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

For background information on the acetylcholine receptor (AChR), see
CHRNA1 (100690). Two forms of AChR are found in mammalian skeletal
muscle cells. The mature form is predominant in innervated adult muscle
and the embryonic form is present in fetal and denervated muscle.
Embryonic and mature AChR differ by the replacement of the gamma subunit
in the pentameric glycoprotein complex by its isoform, the epsilon
subunit (100725), which is specific to the mature AChR subtype. This
switch is mediated by ARIA (acetylcholine receptor-inducing activity;
142445).

GENE FUNCTION

- Role in Myasthenia Gravis

Transient neonatal myasthenia gravis occurs in approximately 20% of
infants born to mothers with myasthenia gravis (see 601462). Symptoms
usually appear within hours after birth and disappear after 2 or 3
weeks. The severity of neonatal MG is highly variable, ranging from mild
hypotonia to respiratory distress requiring assisted mechanical
ventilation. Antenatal onset leading to multiple joint contractures,
hydramnios, and decreased fetal movements is rare. The disease severity
is not correlated to the clinical status of the mother. Vernet-der
Garabedian et al. (1994) studied 22 mothers with myasthenia gravis and
their newborns. Twelve mothers had transmitted MG to their neonates
with, in 3 cases, antenatal injury. A clear correlation was found
between occurrence of neonatal MG and high overall levels of anti-AChR
antibodies. However, a strong correlation was also found between
occurrence of neonatal MG and the ratio of anti-embryonic AChR to
anti-adult muscle AChR antibodies. Taken together, the data suggested
that autoantibodies directed against the embryonic form of AChR, which
contains the gamma subunit, may play a predominant role in the
pathogenesis of neonatal MG. Paradoxically, the 3 cases with antenatal
injury, presumably the most severe form of the disorder, were not
associated with high ratio of anti-embryonic ACh to anti-adult AChR
antibodies.

MAPPING

See CHRND (100720) for a discussion of the probable close linkage of the
genes for the gamma and delta subunits and their possible location on
chromosome 2q. Shibahara et al. (1985) showed that the genes encoding
the gamma and delta subunits of CHRN are contained in an EcoRI
restriction fragment of approximately 20 kb. Cohen-Haguenauer et al.
(1989) used a murine full-length 1,900-bp-long cDNA encoding the gamma
subunit to map the gene to chromosome 2 in human/rodent somatic cell
hybrids. (They used conditions of low stringency to favor cross-species
hybridization, and prehybridization with rodent DNA to prevent rodent
background.) The use of a chromosomal translocation t(X;2)(p22;q32.1)
served to localize the CHRNG gene to 2q32-qter.

Schurr et al. (1990) mapped this gene to mouse chromosome 1 (symbol
Acrg) at a position between Vil (193040) proximally and Col6a3 (120250)
distally.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Hoffmann et al. (2006) and Morgan et al. (2006) demonstrated that
mutations in the CHRNG gene cause Escobar syndrome (EVMPS; 265000) and
the lethal form of multiple pterygium syndrome (LMPS; 253290). These are
autosomal recessive forms of arthrogryposis multiplex congenita
characterized by excessive webbing (pterygia), congenital contractures
(arthrogryposis), and scoliosis. The congenital contractures may be
caused by reduced fetal movements at sensitive times of development
(Hoffmann et al., 2006). The CHRNG gene encodes the gamma subunit of the
acetylcholine receptor (AChR) and is expressed before the 33rd week of
gestation in humans but is replaced by the epsilon subunit (100725) in
the late fetal and perinatal period, thereby forming the adult AChR. The
fetal AChR helps to establish the primary encounter of muscle and axon
(Koenen et al., 2005). Thus, the gamma subunit not only contributes to
neuromuscular signal transduction but is also important for
neuromuscular organogenesis. The importance of the fetal AChR subtype
for neuromuscular development is underscored by the lethal phenotype of
gamma inactivation in mice (Takahashi et al., 2002).

Vogt et al. (2012) identified 20 different homozygous or compound
heterozygous CHRNG mutations (see, e.g., 100730.0008) in 11 (27%) of 41
families with nonlethal multiple pterygium syndrome and 5 (8%) of 59
families with lethal multiple pterygium syndrome. The mutations were
found by direct sequencing of the coding exons only. Most patients
(87.5%) with a CHRNG mutation had pterygia; none with CHRNG mutations
had central nervous system anomalies. The mutation spectrum was similar
in EVMPS and LMPS kindreds, and both phenotypes were observed in
different families with the same CHRNG mutation. Based on these
findings, Vogt et al. (2012) proposed a molecular genetic diagnostic
pathway for the investigation of MPS.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
ESCOBAR SYNDROME
CHRNG, GLN18TER

In affected members of a family with Escobar syndrome (265000) reported
by Rajab et al. (2005), Hoffmann et al. (2006) detected a C-to-T
transition at nucleotide 13 in exon 1 of the CHRNG gene that caused a
gln-to-ter substitution at codon 18 (Q18X) of the gamma AChR subunit.

.0002
ESCOBAR SYNDROME
MULTIPLE PTERYGIUM SYNDROME, LETHAL TYPE, INCLUDED
CHRNG, ARG217CYS

In affected members of 2 unrelated consanguineous families from Lebanon
and Turkey, respectively, with Escobar syndrome (265000) and the lethal
form of multiple pterygium syndrome (253290), Hoffmann et al. (2006)
found homozygosity for a 715C-T transition in exon 7 of the CHRNG gene
that resulted in an arg217-to-cys (R217C) amino acid substitution. In
the Lebanese family 1 affected individual died at age 13 days, whereas
the other was alive at 7 years of age; the affected individual from the
Turkish family was stillborn. There was a family history of abortions in
each family.

.0003
ESCOBAR SYNDROME
CHRNG, 9-BP DUP

In a nonconsanguineous family from Germany, Hoffmann et al. (2006) found
that Escobar syndrome (265000) present in 2 sibs was caused by compound
heterozygosity for a 9-bp duplication in exon 4 of the CHRNG gene,
resulting in duplication of 3 amino acids, 78dup(3); and a nonsense
mutation, 1408C-T (R448X; 100730.0004).

Morgan et al. (2006) detected a homozygous missense mutation, 320T-G
(val107 to gly, V107G) in the CHRNG gene. The val107 residue is
conserved in the CHRNG proteins of 6 other species.

.0007

CHRNG, 2-BP DEL, 753CT

In a Turkish family with parental consanguinity, Morgan et al. (2006)

(253290) was caused by a deletion mutation in exon 7 of the CHRNG gene,
753_754delCT (pro251profsX46).

.0008
MULTIPLE PTERYGIUM SYNDROME, LETHAL TYPE
ESCOBAR SYNDROME, INCLUDED
CHRNG, 1-BP DUP, 459A

Vogt et al. (2012) identified a 1-bp duplication (459dupA) in exon 5 of
the CHRNG gene in affected members of 3 unrelated kindreds with lethal
multiple pterygium syndrome (253290) and in 3 unrelated kindreds with
nonlethal Escobar syndrome (265000). Four families were homozygous for
the mutation, whereas 2 carried it in compound heterozygosity with
another pathogenic CHRNG mutation. Haplotype analysis of 3 families did
not show a common haplotype, suggesting that this is a mutation hotspot.

612765	TITLE *612765 SFI1, YEAST, HOMOLOG OF; SFI1
;;SPINDLE ASSEMBLY-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN SFI1;;
KIAA0542
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) cloned SFI1, which they designated
KIAA0542. The transcript contains a repetitive element in its 3-prime
end. The deduced 968-amino acid protein had an apparent molecular mass
of over 100 kD by SDS-PAGE. RT-PCR detected SFI1 in all tissues
examined.

By searching databases for sequences similar to yeast Sfi1, Kilmartin
(2003) identified 2 splice variants of human SFI1. The deduced 968- and
1,242-amino acid proteins have a central domain made up of imperfect
repeats of 33 to 37 amino acids each. The full-length protein has 23
repeats. The repeat region shares a high degree of similarity with yeast
Sfi1, but there is no homology between the N- and C-terminal domains.
Both human fluorescence-tagged SFI1 isoforms localized close to
centrioles in transfected HeLa cells. In yeast, Sfi1 localized to the
half-bridge of the spindle pole body.

GENE FUNCTION

Kilmartin (2003) showed that the repeat region of yeast and both
isoforms of human SFI1 bound yeast Cdc31 (CETN3; 602907) and human
centrin-2 (CETN2; 300006). Binding required the repeat region of SFI1.
Cdc31 bound directly to individual Sfi1 repeats in yeast Sfi1, so a
single molecule of Sfi1 bound multiple molecules of Cdc31. Yeast Sfi1
mutants showed defective spindle pole body duplication and interaction
with Cdc31, suggesting that, in addition to CDC31, SFI1 is essential for
spindle pole body duplication.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the SFI1 gene
to chromosome 22.

138320	TITLE *138320 GLUTATHIONE PEROXIDASE; GPX1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Glutathione peroxidase (EC 1.11.1.9) catalyzes the reduction of organic
hydroperoxides and hydrogen peroxide by glutathione and thereby protects
against oxidative damage (summary by Cohen et al., 1989).

CLONING

Paglia and Valentine (1967) characterized red cell glutathione
peroxidase.

Sukenaga et al. (1987) presented the sequence of GPX cDNA. GPX is one of
only a few proteins known in higher vertebrates to contain
selenocysteine. This unusual amino acid occurs at the active site of GPX
and is coded by the nonsense (stop) codon TGA. Sequence analysis of cDNA
clones confirmed previous findings that the unusual amino acid
selenocysteine is encoded by the opal terminator codon UGA (Le Beau,
1989). (Note that TGA = UGA; they represent the cDNA and mRNA code,
respectively.) There appears to be a selenocysteyl-tRNA that donates
selenocysteine to the growing polypeptide chain of GPX, and therefore,
selenocysteine becomes the twenty-first naturally occurring amino acid.
A tRNA molecule that carries selenocysteine has its own translating
factor that delivers it to the translating ribosome (Bock et al., 1991).
Bacterial formate dehydrogenase also contains selenocysteine.

MAPPING

Wijnen et al. (1978) presented evidence that GPX1 is on chromosome 3.
Johannsmann et al. (1979) concluded that the GPX locus is on 3p. In situ
hybridization localized the gene to 3p13-q12 (Johannsmann et al., 1981).
McBride et al. (1988) used a cDNA probe to study DNAs isolated from
human-rodent somatic cell hybrids. A 609-bp probe containing the entire
coding region hybridized to human chromosomes 3, 21, and Xp. An intronic
probe detected only the gene on chromosome 3. The sequences on
chromosomes X and 21 showed equal conservation of the 3-prime
untranslated and coding sequences but did not contain introns,
suggesting that they represent processed pseudogenes.

By fluorescence in situ hybridization and PCR analysis, Kiss et al.
(1997) mapped the GPX1 gene to 3p21.3. Their results were compatible
with the existence of a pseudogene of GPX1 on 3q11-q12 (Chada et al.,
1990).

Mehdizadeh et al. (1996) mapped the Gpx1 gene to mouse chromosome 9 in a
region of known conserved homology between mouse chromosome 9 and human
chromosome 3.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a radioimmunoassay for GSHPx, Takahashi et al. (1986) showed that
there is a direct relationship between GPX enzyme activity and enzyme
protein concentration. Thus, selenium is necessary for the synthesis of
protein. Selenium deficiency (see 614164) results in a decrease not only
in glutathione peroxidase activity but also in GSHPx protein. Only
erythrocytes formed in the presence of selenium contain GSHPx activity.
The possibility of confusing genetic and environmental factors is
indicated. Takahashi et al. (1987) observed a selenium-dependent GPX in
human plasma that is distinct from the one found in erythrocytes.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

By electrophoretic means, Beutler and West (1974) demonstrated
polymorphism of red cell glutathione peroxidase in Afro-Americans. An
electrophoretic polymorphism of glutathione peroxidase was described by
Beutler et al. (1974).

Beutler and Matsumoto (1975) found that persons of Jewish ancestry and
others of Mediterranean origin have a decrease in red cell GPX activity,
but not of leukocyte or fibroblast activity. Oriental populations showed
a significantly lower scatter in red cell enzyme levels in comparison
with Occidental populations. The authors suggested the existence of a
low GPX allele with a frequency of about 0.556 in the Jewish population
and 0.181 in the U.S.-Northern European population. They recommended
caution in assigning a cause-effect relationship to GPX deficiency
(614164) and hemolytic anemia.

Meera Khan et al. (1986) studied the genetics of red cell GPX1 in the
Djuka of Suriname. This group consists of descendants of captives from
the Gold Coast (Ghana) of Africa brought to Suriname during the 17th
century and of others probably from a wider region of West Africa
transported during the 18th century. During successive waves of revolt
and following the abolition of slavery, the Djuka escaped into the
interior of Suriname and organized themselves into groups which have
lived since then as permanent forest dwellers with little or no
extra-ethnic mixture. Meera Khan et al. (1986) found that the Djuka have
a frequency of the GPX1*2 allele of 0.054 and suggested that the GPX1*2
allele is an African marker. The only non-Africans in whom it is
presently found are Ashkenazi Jews living in the United States and the
Punjabis of the Indian subcontinent. It was proposed that both groups
independently acquired the variant allele through an ancient African
mixture. See Meera Khan et al. (1984).

The catalytic activity of GPX1 enzyme in the 2-1 heterozygote is greater
than that in the 1-1 homozygote. It may be that individuals with the
higher peroxidase activity have an intraerythrocytic environment which
is less favorable for the survival of the falciparum parasite and
therefore that the 2-1 heterozygote enjoys a selective advantage in a
malarious environment. Meera Khan et al. (1986) referred to the
electrophoretic variants as electrotypes.

Shen et al. (1994) reported variation in vivo and instability in vitro
of an in-frame GCG trinucleotide repeat in the GPX1 gene. In a
population study of 110 alleles from 55 unrelated persons, the allele
frequencies for 4, 5, and 6 GCG repeats were 0.40, 0.35, and 0.25,
respectively. No allele was associated with diminished enzyme activity.
Current stocks of HL-60 cells, a human myeloid leukemia cell line, were
found to be homozygous for the 6-repeat allele. The expansion of the
repeat appears to have developed in the course of multiple passages of
the rapidly proliferating cell line because cells frozen in 1976 showed
a 4/6 genotype and 'intermediate' passage cells frozen in 1985 contained
both 4/6 and 5/6 genotypes.

Data on gene frequencies of allelic variants were tabulated by
Roychoudhury and Nei (1988).

ANIMAL MODEL

De Haan et al. (1998) demonstrated a role for GPX1 in protection against
oxidative stress by showing that Gpx1 -/- mice are highly sensitive to
the oxidant paraquat. Lethality was detected within 24 hours in mice
exposed to paraquat at 10 mg/kg(-1), approximately 1/7 of the LD50 of
wildtype controls. The effects of paraquat were dose-related. De Haan et
al. (1998) further demonstrated that paraquat transcriptionally
upregulates Gpx1 in normal cells, reinforcing a role for GPX1 in
protection against paraquat toxicity. Cortical neurons from Gpx1 -/-
mice are more susceptible to peroxide; 30% of neurons from
Gpx1-deficient mice were killed when exposed to 65 micromolar peroxide,
whereas the wildtype controls were unaffected. De Haan et al. (1998)
stated that their data established function for GPX1 in protection
against some oxidative stressors and in protection of neurons against
peroxide.

Reddy et al. (2001) studied the functional role of GPX1 activity in
antioxidant mechanisms of lens in vivo by comparing lens changes of Gpx1
knockout mice with age-matched control animals. Slit-lamp images showed
increased nuclear light scattering (NLS) in Gpx1 knockout mice compared
with control animals. Transmission electron microscopy revealed changes
in the nucleus manifested by waviness of fiber membranes as early as 3
weeks of age. The Gpx1 knockout mice developed mature cataracts after 15
months. Reddy et al. (2001) concluded that their results demonstrated
the critical role of GPX1 in antioxidant defense mechanisms of the lens
nucleus. The increased NLS appeared to be associated with damage to
nuclear fiber membranes, which might have been due to formation of lipid
peroxides, which serve as substrates for GPX1. Cataract formation
appeared to progress from focal opacities, apparent at an early age, to
lamellar cataracts between 6 and 10 months, and finally to complete
opacification in animals older than 15 months.

Shiomi et al. (2004) created myocardial infarction by left coronary
artery ligation in mice overexpressing Gpx1 in the heart and wildtype
mice. Although infarct size was comparable, the transgenic mice had an
increased survival rate with decreased left ventricular dilatation,
dysfunction, and end-diastolic pressure compared to wildtype mice. The
improvement in left ventricular function was accompanied by a decrease
in myocyte hypertrophy, apoptosis, and interstitial fibrosis in the
noninfarcted left ventricle. Shiomi et al. (2004) concluded that
overexpression of Gpx1 protects the heart against post-myocardial
infarction remodeling and heart failure in mice.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
GLUTATHIONE PEROXIDASE POLYMORPHISM
GPX1, PRO197LEU

Forsberg et al. (1999) searched the human EST database to determine new
polymorphisms in the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (see
147450), glutathione peroxidases, catalase (115500), and microsomal
glutathione transferase-1 (138330). When any mutation, indicated by the
search, gave rise to a nonconservative amino acid change, they performed
PCR restriction analysis and/or sequence analysis of genomic DNA from
human subjects in order to verify these potential polymorphisms. In this
way, they identified a pro197-to-leu substitution in the GPX1 gene,
resulting from a C-to-T transition at nucleotide 593. The corresponding
allele frequencies were approximately 70% for pro197 and 30% for leu197.

615389	TITLE *615389 ISOPENTENYL-DIPHOSPHATE DELTA ISOMERASE 2; IDI2
;;IPPI2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The 5-carbon isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and its highly electrophilic
isomer dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) are the building blocks for
synthesis of geranyl diphosphate, farnesyl diphosphate, and, ultimately,
nonsterol products and cholesterol. Isopentenyl diphosphate isomerases
(EC 5.3.3.2), such as IDI2, transform unreactive IPP into its reactive
isomer DMAPP (summary by Clizbe et al., 2007).

CLONING

Breitling et al. (2003) identified a tandem duplication that gave rise
to the IDI1 (604055) and IDI2 genes in humans and mice. The deduced IDI2
protein contains a catalytic center that differs from that of IDI1, and
both IDI1 and IDI2 have a possible C-terminal peroxisomal targeting
signal. Mouse Idi2 lacks the peroxisomal targeting signal. EST database
analysis predicted ubiquitous IDI1 expression in human and mouse
tissues, whereas IDI2 appeared to be expressed almost exclusively in
skeletal muscle.

Using RT-PCR, Clizbe et al. (2007) cloned human IDI2, which contains a
684-bp ORF. Northern blot analysis of 12 human tissues detected a 1.9-kb
transcript in skeletal muscle only. In contrast, IDI1 showed ubiquitous
expression. Quantitative real-time PCR detected IDI2 expression only in
skeletal muscle, where it was expressed at higher levels than IDI1.
Fluorescence-tagged IDI1 and IDI2 colocalized with peroxisome markers in
a punctate distribution in transfected HeLa cells.

GENE FUNCTION

In yeast, deletion of the single-copy isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase
gene, Idi1, is lethal. Clizbe et al. (2007) found that expression of
human IDI2 in Idi1-null yeast rescued the lethal phenotype. Partially
purified recombinant human IDI2 expressed in yeast isomerized IPP to
DMAP in vitro, with a pH optimum of 8.0 and maximal activity in the
presence of Mn(2+). In mouse skeletal muscle, Idi2 mRNA was
significantly reduced following exposure to the cholesterol-lowering
drugs statin and fibrate, whereas mRNA levels of Idi1 and HMG-CoA
reductase (HMGCR; 142910) were unchanged. Feeding mice a high-fat diet
also significantly reduced skeletal muscle Idi2 mRNA, but it increased
Idi1 mRNA. Overexpression of Idi2 in mouse myoblasts decreased the
synthesis of cholesterol, fatty acid, and dolichol and reduced total
cellular cholesterol. Overexpression of Idi2 also reduced Hmgcr
activity, but not Hmgcr mRNA.

GENE STRUCTURE

Breitling et al. (2003) determined that the IDI1 and IDI2 genes both
contain 5 exons, including a noncoding first exon. They identified
several randomly inserted Alu repeats in the intronic sequences of both
genes and in the intervening sequence between the genes.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Breitling et al. (2003) mapped the IDI1
and IDI2 genes to the subtelomeric region of chromosome 10p. They mapped
the mouse Idi1 and Idi2 genes to a subcentromeric region of chromosome
13 that shares homology of synteny with the subtelomeric region of human
chromosome 10. Breitling et al. (2003) also identified the HT009 gene
(IDI2AS1; 615391) on the opposite strand in human, but not mouse. HT009
has exons that overlap both IDI1 and IDI2.

Hartz (2013) mapped the IDI2 gene to chromosome 10p15 based on an
alignment of the IDI2 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC040651) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

EVOLUTION

Breitling et al. (2003) found that the IDI gene was subject to an
ancient duplication event in higher mammals, but not in lower
vertebrates, such as fish and protochordates. The second copy, IDI2, is
more divergent and evolved faster than IDI1 in both humans and mice.

614760	TITLE *614760 PQ LOOP REPEAT-CONTAINING PROTEIN 2; PQLC2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching a human database for sequences similar to the C. elegans
lysosomal amino acid transporter Laat1, followed by PCR of a HEK293 cDNA
library, Liu et al. (2012) cloned PQLC2. The deduced protein contains
291 amino acids. Both PQLC2 and Laat1 contain 7 transmembrane domains, 2
PQ loop repeats characteristic of lysosomal cystine transporters, and a
putative lysosomal sorting motif near the C terminus. PQLC2 localized to
lysosomes in transfected COS-7 cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Cystinosis (219800) is caused by intralysosomal accumulation of free
cystine due to a mutation in the lysosomal cystine transporter (CTNS;
606272). The aminothiol cysteamine, used to treat cystinosis, converts
lysosomal cystine to cysteine and the mixed disulfide of
cysteine-cysteamine, which is believed to be exported from lysosomes by
a lysine-cationic amino acid transporter. Using transfected human cell
lines and mutant worms, Liu et al. (2012) found that human PQLC2 and C.
elegans Laat1 functioned as the necessary lysine-cationic amino acid
transporter. Knockout of Laat1 in worms caused elevated lysosomal lysine
and arginine content, although cystine content was normal. Laat1-Ctns
double mutation resulted in additional cystine accumulation that was
resistant to cysteamine treatment. In transfection experiments with
COS-7 cells, deletion of the lysosomal sorting motif of PQLC2 or Laat1
resulted in proteins that were redirected to the plasma membrane. The
deletion also increased cellular lysine and arginine uptake, which was
abolished when the invariant pro in the first PQ loop was mutated to leu
in PQLC2 or Laat1.

MAPPING

Hartz (2012) mapped the PQLC2 gene to chromosome 1p36.13 based on an
alignment of the PQLC2 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK000327) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

606431	TITLE *606431 UDP-GLYCOSYLTRANSFERASE 1 FAMILY, POLYPEPTIDE A6; UGT1A6
;;UGT1F;;
GNT1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Enzymes of the UDP glycosyltransferase (UGT; EC 2.4.1.17) superfamily
covalently link glycosyl groups to lipophilic substrates. UGT1A enzymes,
such as UGT1A6, efficiently use UDP-glucuronic acid as the glycosyl
donor and are invaluable in detoxifying both endogenous and foreign
chemicals, because the glycosylated chemical is more water soluble and
therefore more readily excreted. Several UGT1A enzymes, including
UGT1A6, are encoded by the UGT1A gene complex on chromosome 2q37. Within
this complex, 9 viable first exons are independently spliced to 4 common
exons to generate 9 UGT1A transcripts with unique 5-prime ends and
identical 3-prime ends. UGT1A6, like each first exon within the UGT1A
gene complex, is considered a unique gene linked to the 4 common exons
(Gong et al., 2001; Mackenzie et al., 2005). See 191740 for further
information on the UGT1A gene complex.

CLONING

Harding et al. (1988) used a rat kidney phenol
UDP-glucuronosyltransferase cDNA to isolate a human phenol
UDP-glucuronosyltransferase cDNA from a human liver cDNA library. They
found that the deduced 531-amino acid protein (UGT1A6) is 76% identical
to the rat protein. Transfection of a recombinant plasmid containing the
clone into COS-7 cells allowed the expression of a protein of about 55
kD. The expressed enzyme rapidly catalyzed the glucuronidation of
1-naphthol, 4-methylumbelliferone, and 4-nitrophenol but did not
catalyze the glucuronidation of testosterone, androsterone, and estrone.

By screening a genomic cosmid library for sequences similar to UGT1A1
(191740) and UGT1A4 (606429), Ritter et al. (1992) identified an exon
encoding the unique region of UGT1A6, which they termed UGT1F. Northern
blot analysis revealed that UGT1A6 expression is less than that of
UGT1A4 and much less than UGT1A1 in liver. Equivalent levels of UGT1A6,
but not of UGT1A1 or UGT1A4, are also expressed in kidney and skin.

MAPPING

Harding et al. (1989, 1990) used a cDNA probe for Southern blot analysis
of human-rodent somatic cell hybrid DNAs and determined that phenol
UDPGT is encoded by a single gene, UGT1, located on chromosome 2.

608066	TITLE *608066 SCAFFOLD ATTACHMENT FACTOR B2; SAFB2
;;KIAA0138
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing cDNAs randomly selected from a cDNA library derived from
the human immature myeloid cell line KG-1, Nagase et al. (1995)
identified a partial cDNA, which they designated KIAA0138. Northern blot
analysis detected expression in all human tissues and cell lines
examined, with highest expression in kidney and lowest expression in
liver.

By database searching with the sequence of nuclear matrix
protein/scaffold attachment factor (SAFB; 602895) as query, Townson et
al. (2003) identified KIAA0138, which they renamed SAFB2, as a member of
the scaffold attachment factor family. SAFB2 encodes a deduced 953-amino
acid protein with 75% homology to SAFB. Both SAFB and SAFB2 contain a
highly conserved SAF box and RRM domain and both contain a nuclear
localization signal. Using RT-PCR with SAFB2-specific primers, Townson
et al. (2003) found that, like SAFB, SAFB2 is expressed in several
breast cancer cell lines. Using SAFB- and SAFB2-specific probes in RNase
protection assays, they found that the 2 genes are coexpressed in many
tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

As had been shown for SAFB, Townson et al. (2003) found that SAFB2
functions as an estrogen receptor corepressor and that its
overexpression results in inhibition of proliferation. SAFB and SAFB2
interact directly through a C-terminal domain, resulting in additive
repression activity. Whereas SAFB is exclusively nuclear, SAFB2 is found
in the cytoplasm as well as in the nucleus. Transfection experiments
detected interaction between SAFB2 and vinexin, a protein involved in
linking signaling to the cytoskeleton.

Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-on-chip and gene expression
array analyses of MCF7 human breast cancer cells, Hammerich-Hille et al.
(2010) identified 541 SAFB1- and/or SAFB2-binding sites in promoters of
known genes. Enrichment of binding sites was observed in regions of
chromosomes 1 and 6 containing histone gene clusters. Gene expression
array analysis revealed upregulation of most target genes following
knockdown of SAFB1 or SAFB2 via small interfering RNA. In general, SAFB2
regulated fewer genes than SAFB1, and there was relatively little
overlap in the genes regulated by SAFB1 and SAFB2.

GENE STRUCTURE

Townson et al. (2003) determined that the SAFB and SAFB2 genes are
adjacent and arranged in a head-to-head fashion, being separated by a
short GC-rich intergenic region that can function as a bidirectional
promoter. The bidirectional promoter contains a number of potential
transcription factor binding sites, SP1 being the most frequent.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Townson et al. (2003) identified the SAFB2 gene
adjacent to the SAFB gene on chromosome 19p13.3.

600525	TITLE *600525 DISTAL-LESS HOMEOBOX 3; DLX3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The Distal-less family of genes, including DLX3, comprises at least 6
different members sharing a homeobox sequence similar to that found in
the Drosophila Distal-less (Dll) gene.

CLONING

Price et al. (1998) cloned and sequenced the DLX3 gene. The deduced
288-amino acid protein contains a homeobox in its C- terminal region.
Human DLX3 shares 98% identity with mouse Dlx3, and the homeodomain of
human DLX3 shares 100% identity with the homeodomains of mouse, Mexican
salamander (axolotl), newt, zebrafish and Xenopus Dlx3. Northern blot
analysis detected a 2.5-kb transcript in human placenta.

GENE STRUCTURE

Price et al. (1998) determined that the DLX3 gene contains 3 coding
exons.

GENE FUNCTION

Hassan et al. (2004) found that Msx2 (123101), Dlx3, Dlx5 (600028), and
Runx2 (600211) regulated the expression of osteocalcin (OC) (BGLAP;
112260) in mouse embryos and therefore are implicated in the control of
bone formation. Msx2 associated with transcriptionally repressed OC
chromatin, and Dlx3 and Dlx5 were recruited with Runx2 to initiate OC
transcription. In a second regulatory switch, Dlx3 association decreased
and Dlx5 recruitment increased coincident with the mineralization stage
of osteoblast differentiation. The appearance of Dlx3 followed by Dlx5
in the OC promoter correlated with increased transcription represented
by increased occupancy of RNA polymerase II.

MAPPING

Using a somatic cell hybrid mapping panel and FISH, Scherer et al.
(1995) mapped the human DLX3 gene to chromosome 17q21.3-q22. Nakamura et
al. (1996) found that human DLX3 and DLX4 (601911) are 10 kb apart on
chromosome 17. DLX3 is in the same general region as the HOX2 cluster of
genes (e.g., HOX2A; 142960), whereas DLX1 and DLX2 are syntenic to the
HOX4 cluster (e.g., HOX4A; 142980) on chromosome 2, and the DLX5 and
DLX6 loci are near the HOX1 cluster (e.g., HOX1A; 142950) on 7q. These
observations offered another piece of evidence for paralogy between
human chromosomes 2, 7, and 17.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Price et al. (1998) noted that trichodentoosseous syndrome (TDO; 190320)
maps to chromosome 17q21, a region that includes 2 members of the
distal-less homeobox gene family, DLX3 and DLX7 (also known as DLX4;
601911). They identified a 4-bp deletion (600525.0001) in the DLX3 gene
that correlated with the TDO phenotype in 6 families.

Amelogenesis imperfecta, hypomaturation-hypoplastic type, with
taurodontism (AI4; 104510) is an autosomal dominant trait associated
with enamel defects and enlarged pulp chambers. Dong et al. (2005)
studied a family with transmission of this disorder through 3
generations with 11 affected individuals in 5 sibships and 1 instance of
male-to-male transmission. Linkage analysis mapped the phenotype to
chromosome 17q21-q22 (lod score = 3.3), and mutation analysis identified
a 2-bp deletion in the DLX3 gene associated with the disorder (560delCT;
600525.0002). This was the first report of a mutation within the
homeodomain of DLX3; the 4-bp deletion in DLX3 associated with TDO is
situated outside the homeodomain. Dong et al. (2005) concluded that TDO
and some forms of AIHHT are allelic.

Wright et al. (2008) analyzed the DLX3 gene in a 3-generation family
with an attenuated TDO phenotype and identified heterozygosity for the
560delCT mutation in all affected individuals. Noting that affected
individuals in this kindred had changes in hair, tooth, and bone,
although to a lesser degree than individuals with the 4-bp deletion
(600525.0001), the authors concluded that this mutation causes TDO with
an attenuated phenotype, not AIHHT, as previously reported.

ANIMAL MODEL

Morasso et al. (1999) found that the targeted deletion of the mouse Dlx3
gene resulted in embryonic death between day 9.5 and day 10 because of
placental defects that altered the development of the labyrinthine
layer. In situ hybridization showed that the Dlx3 gene is initially
expressed in ectoplacental cone cells and chorionic plate, and later in
the labyrinthine trophoblast of the chorioallantoic placenta, where
major defects are observed in the Dlx3 -/- embryos. They found that by
day 10.5 of development, expression of the paired-like homeodomain gene
Esx1 was strongly downregulated in affected placenta tissue, suggesting
that Dlx3 is required for the maintenance of Esx1 expression, normal
placental morphogenesis, and embryonic survival.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
TRICHODENTOOSSEOUS SYNDROME
DLX3, 4-BP DEL, NT3198

In all affected members of 6 trichodentoosseous syndrome (TDO; 190320)
pedigrees, Price et al. (1998) found deletion of 4 G nucleotides
beginning at nucleotide 3198 in 1 allele of the DLX3 gene. The deletion
resulted in the frameshift of the 3-prime terminal portion of DLX3 but
left the homeodomain intact. An in-frame termination codon was present
in the deletion allele at nucleotide 3398; this resulted in a mutant
protein that was 32 amino acids shorter than the normal DLX3 protein.
The most penetrant clinical findings in TDO patients are taurodontism
and enamel defects in teeth. In early murine tooth formation, Dlx3 is
expressed primarily in the neural crest-derived mesenchymal component of
the tooth that will later give rise to the dentin and pulp. The whisker
and hair follicles of mice strongly express Dlx3 before birth, followed
by a decrease in expression after birth. This could correlate with the
kinky, curly hair observed in TDO patients at birth, that in over half
the cases straightens during infancy. The osseous cranial changes in TDO
patients are more difficult to understand than the hair and tooth
anomalies, but murine Dlx3 expression has been detected in the dense
mesenchyme of the branchial arches, which subsequently condenses and
ossifies to form the bones of the skull and face.

Price et al. (1998) identified the same 4-bp deletion in a Virginia
family. A common haplotype for 3 markers surrounding the DLX3 gene was
identified in all affected subjects in the 6 original families and the
Virginia family. Price et al. (1998) concluded that all affected
individuals in these families had inherited the same DLX3 gene deletion
from a common ancestor.

.0002
AMELOGENESIS IMPERFECTA, TYPE IV
TRICHODENTOOSSEOUS SYNDROME, INCLUDED
DLX3, 2-BP DEL, 560CT

In affected members of a 3-generation family with amelogenesis
imperfecta, hypomaturation-hypoplastic type, with taurodontism (AI4;
104510) in an autosomal dominant pedigree pattern, Dong et al. (2005)
identified a 2-bp deletion in the DLX3 gene, 560delCT, resulting in a
frameshift that altered the last 2 amino acids of the DNA-binding
homeodomain and introduced a premature stop codon that truncated the
protein by 88 amino acids.

In 7 affected members of a 3-generation family with an attenuated TDO
phenotype, Wright et al. (2008) identified heterozygosity for the
560delCT mutation in the DLX3 gene. The mutation was not found in 5
unaffected family members. Noting that affected individuals in this
kindred had changes in hair similar to those of individuals with the
4-bp deletion (600525.0001), as well as tooth and bone changes although
to a lesser degree, the authors concluded that this mutation causes TDO
with an attenuated phenotype, not AIHHT, as previously reported.

601485	TITLE *601485 SYNTAXIN 1B; STX1B
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Syntaxins are cellular receptors for transport vesicles (see 603765).
One of these proteins, designated syntaxin 1B (STX1B), is directly
implicated in the process of calcium-dependent synaptic transmission in
rat brain (Smirnova et al., 1993). The expression of this protein is
transiently induced by long-term potentiation of synaptic responses in
the rat hippocampus. The protein may play an important role in the
excitatory pathway of synaptic transmission, which is known to be
implicated in several neurologic diseases.

MAPPING

Smirnova et al. (1996) mapped the human STX1B gene to 16p11.2 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization. The gene was found at a single
locus. Chromosome rearrangements with breaks in 16p11 are observed in
myxoid liposarcoma and in acute myeloid leukemia.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Smirnova et al. (1996) noted that a tumor that displays neuroendocrine
properties, small cell lung cancer (182280), has been observed in about
60% of patients with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, an autoimmune
disease of neurotransmission that is characterized by muscle weakness
(Vincent et al., 1989). Autoantibodies from these patients recognize the
presynaptic N-type calcium channel and synaptotagmin (185605), 2
proteins that are involved in synaptic transmission and interact with
syntaxin.

300044	TITLE *300044 TRANSKETOLASE-LIKE 1; TKTL1
;;TRANSKETOLASE 2; TKT2;;
TRANSKETOLASE-RELATED GENE; TKR
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Transketolase (TKT; 606781) is a thiamine-dependent enzyme that links
the pentose phosphate pathway with the glycolytic pathway. As part of a
systematic search for differentially expressed genes, Coy et al. (1996)
isolated a novel transketolase-related gene, TKTL1, which they called
TKR. They isolated transcripts encoding tissue-specific protein
isoforms. Comparison with known transketolases demonstrated a
TKR-specific deletion mutating 1 thiamine-binding site.

MAPPING

Coy et al. (1996) mapped the TKR gene between the green color vision
pigment gene (300821) and the actin-binding protein-280 filamin gene
(300017) on Xq28.

EVOLUTION

Genomic sequencing of the TKR gene by Coy et al. (1996) revealed the
presence of a pseudoexon, as well as the acquisition of a
tissue-specific spliced exon, compared to the TKT gene, which maps to
3p14.3. Coy et al. (1996) speculated that, since it had been postulated
that the vertebrate genome arose by 2 cycles of tetraploidization from a
cephalochordate genome, the finding of the pseudoexon and spliced exon
could reflect the modulation of the function of a preexisting
transketolase gene by gene duplication.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

A variant transketolase enzyme has been proposed to be associated with
Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (277730); however, no mutations have been
found in the transketolase gene cloned from these patients (McCool et
al., 1993). The findings of Coy et al. (1996) raised the possibility
that variation in the X-linked TKT gene may be responsible for the
genetic predisposition to the development of Wernicke-Korsakoff
syndrome.

603771	TITLE *603771 PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE 1, REGULATORY SUBUNIT 10; PPP1R10
;;PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE 1 NUCLEAR TARGETING SUBUNIT; PNUTS;;
PP1 NUCLEAR TARGETING SUBUNIT
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) is a serine/threonine phosphatase that
exerts control over many aspects of cellular physiology by reversing the
actions of protein kinases. The activity of its catalytic subunit (e.g.,
PPP1CA; 176875) is thought to be directed by interaction with a family
of regulatory proteins. PPP1R10 belongs to a subfamily of PP1 regulatory
proteins, referred to as targeting subunits, that may target PP1 to
specific subcellular locations and modulate its activity toward specific
substrates at these sites (summary by Allen et al., 1998).

CLONING

Totaro et al. (1996) isolated a partial cDNA corresponding to a novel
gene, PPP1R10, located within the HLA class I region at chromosome
6p21.3. By screening human fetal brain and colon carcinoma cell line
(CaCo2) cDNA libraries with this partial cDNA, Totaro et al. (1998)
cloned cDNAs representing the full-length transcript of PPP1R10, which
they named FB19. Northern blot analysis showed that PPP1R10 was widely
expressed as a 4.5-kb transcript. The deduced 940-amino acid PPP1R10
protein contains a glycine-rich region.

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen to identify proteins that interact with
the alpha isoform of Pp1 (Ppp1ca), Allen et al. (1998) cloned rat cDNAs
encoding Ppp1r10, which they called Pnuts. Pnuts exhibited a discrete
nuclear compartmentalization and colocalized with chromatin at distinct
phases during mitosis. Western blot analysis of human cell line extracts
using antibodies against Pnuts detected an approximately 120-kD protein.

Lee et al. (2010) reported that the PPP1R10 protein contains a
transcription elongation factor S II (TCEA1; 601425) N-terminal (TFS2N)
domain, a consensus RVxF motif for binding PP1, and a C-terminal zinc
finger motif.

GENE FUNCTION

Allen et al. (1998) showed that rat Pnuts formed a stable complex with
Pp1 in mammalian cell lysates and modulated Pp1 catalytic activity
toward exogenous substrate in vitro. They concluded that PNUTS is a
targeting subunit for the regulation of nuclear PP1 function.

By immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometric analysis of PP1 complexes
in HEK293 cells, Lee et al. (2010) identified a complex containing
PNUTS, TOX4 (614032), WDR82 (611059), and any 1 of the 3 PP1 catalytic
subunits, PP1-alpha, PP1-beta (PPP1CB; 600590), or PP1-gamma (PPP1CC;
176914). The complex, which they called PTW/PP1, had an apparent
molecular mass of about 200 kD, suggesting that it contains 1 molecule
of each subunit. Analysis of individual interactions revealed that mouse
Pnuts directly bound human TOX4, WDR82, and PP1, and no direct
interactions were observed between TOX4, WDR82, and PP1. Mutation
analysis of mouse Pnuts revealed that its TFS2N domain, RVxF motif, and
a central domain interacted with human TOX4, PP1, and WDR82,
respectively. The PTW/PP1 complex efficiently dephosphorylated the
isolated C-terminal domain of the large subunit of mouse RNA polymerase
II (POLR2A; 180660) in vitro. The PTW/PP1 complex was stable throughout
the cell cycle in HEK293 cells, but its association with chromatin was
regulated. PTW/PP1 associated with chromatin during interphase, was
excluded from condensed chromosomes during early mitosis, and was
reloaded onto chromosomes at late telophase. Expression of a PP1
interaction-defective mutant of mouse Pnuts or knockdown of PNUTS via
small interfering RNA in HEK293 cells disrupted the PTW/PP1 complex and
destabilized individual subunits, blocked cell cycle progression at
G2/M, and resulted in apoptosis. Lee et al. (2010) concluded that the
PTW/PP1 complex is essential for the transition from mitosis to
interphase, and they hypothesized that PTW/PP1 is involved in chromatin
remodeling.

In mice, Boon et al. (2013) showed that Mir34a (611172) is induced in
the aging heart and that in vivo silencing or genetic deletion of Mir34a
reduced age-associated cardiomyocyte cell death. Moreover, Mir34a
inhibition reduced cell death and fibrosis following acute myocardial
infarction and improved recovery of myocardial function.
Mechanistically, Boon et al. (2013) identified Pnuts as a novel direct
Mir34a target that reduces telomere shortening, DNA damage responses,
and cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and improves functional recovery after
acute myocardial infarction. Boon et al. (2013) concluded that their
results identified age-induced expression of MIR34A and inhibition of
its target PNUTS as a key mechanism that regulates cardiac contractile
function during aging and after acute myocardial infarction, by inducing
DNA damage responses and telomere attrition.

MAPPING

Totaro et al. (1996) determined that the PPP1R10 gene maps within the
HLA class I region at chromosome 6p21.3, approximately 70 kb centromeric
to the HLA-E gene (143010).

615019	TITLE *615019 ELONGATOR ACETYLTRANSFERASE COMPLEX, SUBUNIT 5; ELP5
;;DERMAL PAPILLA-DERIVED PROTEIN 6; DERP6;;
CHROMOSOME 17 OPEN READING FRAME 81; C17ORF81
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ELP5 is 1 of 6 subunits of the elongator complex. Elongator promotes RNA
polymerase II transcript elongation through histone acetylation in the
nucleus and also regulates translational fidelity through tRNA
modification in the cytoplasm (summary by Close et al., 2012).

CLONING

By PCR of a human testis cDNA library, Yuan et al. (2006) cloned ELP5,
which they called DERP6. The deduced protein contains 316 amino acids.
Northern blot analysis detected variable expression of a major 1.5-kb
DERP6 transcript in all 16 human tissues examined, with highest
expression in heart, brain, liver, skeletal muscle, and testis.
Fluorescence-tagged DERP6 showed a punctate cytoplasmic distribution in
transfected COS-7 cells.

By mass spectrometric analysis of proteins that copurified with the
elongator complex in HEK293 cells, Close et al. (2012) identified ELP5.
The deduced protein contains a large central HAP2 (NFYA; 189903)
elongator superfamily domain. SDS-PAGE detected ELP5 at an apparent
molecular mass of 38 kD. In fractionated cells, Western blot analysis
detected most ELP5 in the cytosolic fraction, with a small proportion in
the nuclear fraction.

GENE FUNCTION

Yuan et al. (2006) found that human DERP6 increased transcriptional
activity of a p53 (TP53; 191170) reporter. DERP6 had no effect on other
transcription factors examined.

Using RNA interference, Close et al. (2012) found that depletion of any
of the elongator complex components Elp1 (IKBKAP; 603722), Elp3
(612722), Elp5, or Elp6 (615020) in B16-F10 mouse melanoma cells reduced
cell motility in a wound-healing assay and reduced the capacity of cells
to form colonies in soft agar. Deletion analysis revealed that 2 ELP5
domains interacted with ELP4 (606985) and that 2 distinct ELP5 domains
interacted with ELP1 and ELP3. Protein pull-down assays revealed that
ELP5 was required for interaction of ELP3 with ELP4.

GENE STRUCTURE

Yuan et al. (2006) determined that the ELP5 gene contains 8 exons and
spans about 8 kb. All exons contain coding sequence.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Yuan et al. (2006) mapped the ELP5 gene to
chromosome 17p13.1.

185660	TITLE *185660 SURFEIT 4; SURF4
;;ERV29, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; ERV29
DESCRIPTION For background information on the surfeit genes, see SURF1 (185620).

CLONING

Using PCR with primers based on the sequence of mouse Surf4 to screen a
HeLa cell cDNA library, Reeves and Fried (1995) obtained a cDNA encoding
human SURF4. The deduced 269-amino acid protein, which is 60% and 99%
identical to the worm and mouse proteins, respectively, contains 7
transmembrane segments, a predicted luminal N terminus, multiple
phosphorylation sites, and a double-lysine retrieval motif at the C
terminus. Immunoblot analysis showed expression of a 30-kD membrane
protein. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated cytoplasmic
expression.

Using Northern blot analysis, Garson et al. (1996) detected 3 variants
of mouse Surf4 that were ubiquitously expressed, although the levels of
each transcript varied between tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

Belden and Barlowe (2001) showed that Erv29, the yeast homolog of SURF4,
is directly required for packaging glycosylated pro-alpha-factor (Gpaf)
into COPII (see COPA; 601924) vesicles. Subcellular fractionation
experiments indicated that Erv29 is equally distributed between
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi membranes. Increased expression of
Erv29 in the ER alleviated the accumulation of Gpaf. Belden and Barlowe
(2001) proposed that Erv29 binds to fully folded Gpaf and probably to
other soluble secretory cargo in the ER, after which the Erv29-cargo
complexes are packaged into COPII vesicles for transport to the Golgi
complex. The authors noted that similar mechanisms have been postulated
for ERGIC1 (LMAN1; 601567).

GENE STRUCTURE

Duhig et al. (1998) stated that the 5-prime end of each of the surfeit
genes, including SURF4, is contained within a CpG island. Although the
mouse Surf2 (185630) and Surf4 genes overlap at their 3-prime ends,
human SURF2 and SURF4 are separated by 302 bp due to a much shorter
3-prime UTR in the human SURF2 gene.

MAPPING

By contig analysis, Duhig et al. (1998) mapped the SURF4 gene to the
telomeric end of the surfeit locus on chromosome 9q34.

601576	TITLE *601576 PROTEIN-TYROSINE PHOSPHATASE, RECEPTOR-TYPE, SIGMA; PTPRS
;;RPTP-SIGMA
DESCRIPTION 
GENE FAMILY

Protein-tyrosine phosphatase sigma (PTPRS) is a receptor type
protein-tyrosine phosphatase that has been cloned and identified in
mouse, in rat, and in human (Pulido et al., 1995). PTPRS is a member of
a subfamily of receptor type PTPases that includes LAR (PTPRF; 179590)
and PTP-delta. Wagner et al. (1996) noted that this subfamily of cell
surface glycoproteins is characterized by the presence of an
extracellular cell adhesion molecule-like motif and 2 intracellular
phosphatase domains. Transcripts of these genes are subject to RNA
processing, resulting in several distinct isoforms. These proteins share
a high overall degree of sequence similarity, especially in the second
intracellular catalytic domain, which is thought to interact with the
same molecule. Analysis of the expression pattern of PTPRS suggests that
it may be involved in the development of the nervous system.

GENE FUNCTION

Batt et al. (2002) examined the role of PTP on pituitary, pancreas, and
enteroendocrine cytodifferentiation, hormone production, and
development. The adenohypophyses of PTPRS-null mice were small and
exhibited reduced GH (see 139250) and PRL (176760) immunoreactivity.
Cells containing TSH (see 188540), LH (see 152780), FSH (see 136530),
ACTH, pituitary-specific POU homeodomain factor (Pit1; 173110), estrogen
receptor (see 133430), and steroidogenic factor-1 (184757) were found in
normal proportions and distributions. The diminished expression of GH
and PRL was not associated with apoptosis of somatotrophs or
lactotrophs. In the knockout mice, pancreatic islets were hypoplastic
with reduced insulin immunoreactivity, and there was also variable
expression of gut hormones. Functionally, the GH deficiency was
associated with hypoglycemia and death in the PTPRS-null neonates, and
accordingly, intraperitoneal administration of GH rescued the PTPRS-null
neonates and normalized the blood glucose. The authors concluded that
PTP-sigma plays a major role in differentiation and development of the
neuroendocrine system.

Shen et al. (2009) demonstrated that the transmembrane protein tyrosine
phosphatase PTP-sigma binds with high affinity to neural chondroitin
sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs; see 155760). Binding involves the
chondroitin sulfate chains and a specific site on the first
immunoglobulin-like domain of PTP-sigma. In culture, PTP-sigma-null
neurons show reduced inhibition by CSPG. A PTP-sigma fusion protein
probe can detect cognate ligands that are upregulated specifically at
neural lesion sites. After spinal cord injury, PTPRS gene disruption
enhanced the ability of axons to penetrate regions containing CSPG. Shen
et al. (2009) concluded that PTP-sigma can act as a receptor for
chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans and may provide new therapeutic
approaches to neural regeneration.

Coles et al. (2011) reported that RPTP-sigma, also known as PTPRS, acts
bimodally in sensory neuron extension, mediating CSPG inhibition and
HSPG (142460) growth promotion. Crystallographic analyses of a shared
HSPG-CSPG binding site reveal a conformational plasticity that can
accommodate diverse glycosaminoglycans with comparable affinities.
Heparan sulfate and analogs induced RPTP-sigma ectodomain
oligomerization in solution, which was inhibited by chondroitin sulfate.
RPTP-sigma and HSPGs colocalize in puncta on sensory neurons in culture,
whereas CSPGs occupy the extracellular matrix. Coles et al. (2011)
concluded that their results lead to a model where proteoglycans can
exert opposing effects on neuronal extension by competing to control the
oligomerization of a common receptor.

MAPPING

Wagner et al. (1996) used a murine cDNA of Ptprs as a hybridization
probe for genetic mapping of the human homolog, PTPRS. By fluorescence
in situ hybridization analysis, they showed that PTPRS maps to 19p13.3.
Hybridization analysis of chromosome 19 library cosmids revealed several
positive clones that are part of a contig located in the same region. In
addition, the location of this gene relative to previously mapped
proximal markers revealed a new point in the human-mouse synteny map by
extending the mouse chromosome 17 synteny region in the telomeric
direction.

ANIMAL MODEL

On the basis of its expression and homology with the Drosophila
melanogaster orthologs, which have roles in the targeting of axonal
growth cones, Elchebly et al. (1999) hypothesized that PTP-sigma may
also have a modulating function in cell-cell interactions, as well as in
axon guidance during mammalian embryogenesis. To investigate its
function in vivo, they generated Ptprs-deficient mice. The resulting
Ptprs -/- animals displayed retarded growth, increased neonatal
mortality, hyposmia, and hypofecundity. Anatomic and histologic analyses
showed a decrease in overall brain size with severe depletion of
luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (152760)-immunoreactive cells in
the hypothalamus of the Ptprs -/- mice. These mice also had an enlarged
intermediate pituitary lobe, but smaller anterior and posterior lobes.
These results suggested that tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent
signaling pathways regulated by PTP-sigma influence the proliferation
and/or adhesiveness of various cell types in the developing
hypothalamopituitary axis.

Wallace et al. (1999) likewise inactivated the Ptprs gene in mice by
gene targeting. They found that all Ptprs +/- mice developed normally,
whereas 60% of Ptprs -/- mice died within 48 hours after birth. The
surviving homozygous Ptprs -/- mice demonstrated stunted growth,
developmental delays, and severe neurologic defects including spastic
movements, tremor, ataxic gait, abnormal limb flexion, and defective
proprioception. Histopathology of brain sections showed reduction and
hypocellularity of the posterior pituitary of the homozygous deficient
mice, as well as a reduction of approximately 50 to 75% in the number of
choline acetyltransferase-positive cells in the forebrain. Moreover,
peripheral nerve electrophysiologic analysis revealed slower conduction
velocity in the homozygous deficient mice relative to wildtype or
heterozygous animals, associated with an increased proportion of slowly
conducting, small-diameter myelinated fibers and relative
hypomyelination. By approximately 3 weeks of age, most remaining
homozygous deficient mice died from a wasting syndrome with atrophic
intestinal villi. These results suggested that PTP-sigma has a role in
neuronal and epithelial development in mice.

Uetani et al. (2009) obtained late Ptprs/Ptprf double-knockout mouse
embryos at the expected mendelian ratio, but none survived to 4 weeks of
age, likely due to lethality of Ptprs knockout. At embryonic day 18.5,
double-knockout embryos showed severe craniofacial defects, including
exencephaly, micrognathia, and failure of eyelid closure. Additional
malformation of the eye included hyperplastic inner nuclear layers,
persistence of prominent hyaloid arteries, abnormal retrolental tissues,
and disorganized neural retina. Double-knockout embryos also showed
striking abnormalities of the urinary tract, such as hydroureters,
hydronephrosis, duplicated ureter/renal systems, and ureterocele.
Absence of Ptprs and Ptprf activity prevented normal execution of the
apoptotic program necessary for regression of the common nephric duct
during development, resulting in inappropriate tissue survival and
delayed distal ureter maturation. In cell culture, Ptprs bound and
negatively regulated the phosphorylation and signaling of the Ret
receptor tyrosine kinase (164761), whereas Ptprs-induced apoptosis was
inhibited by Ret expression. Uetani et al. (2009) concluded that ureter
positioning is controlled by the opposing actions of RET and LAR family
phosphatases regulating apoptosis-mediated tissue morphogenesis.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database analysis of a 116-kb fragment of chromosome 17p13.3 that
displays loss of heterozygosity in human hepatocellular carcinoma,
followed by screening of a human liver cDNA library (Zhao et al., 2003)
and primer extension, Xu et al. (2002) cloned full-length RNMTL1. RNMTL1
shares 32 to 42% amino acid identity with S. cerevisiae Pet56 and E.
coli RNA methyltransferases, especially over the region implicated in
transfer of the methyl group to rRNA. RT-PCR analysis showed no
difference in expression between human hepatocellular carcinoma and
normal liver cell lines or tissues. Transfection of deletion mutants,
followed by luciferase reporter assay, identified a minimal promoter
element at -71 to +1 of the RNMTL1 sequence. Database analysis, followed
by mobility shift assay, determined that the RNMTL1 promoter is bound by
ATF/CREB (see CREB1; 123810), E2F-DP/SP1 (see E2F1; 189971), and other
transcription factors. Xu et al. (2002) suggested that YY1 (600013) acts
as a negative regulator of RNMTL1 transcription via a proposed
interaction with ATF/CREB.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Xu et al. (2002) mapped the RNMTL1 gene to
chromosome 17p13.3.

;;PFKFB, PLACENTAL;;
PFK2, INDUCIBLE; IPFK2
DESCRIPTION The bifunctional 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase (EC
2.7.1.105)/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (EC 3.1.3.46) (PFKFB) regulates
the steady-state concentration of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate, a potent
activator of a key regulatory enzyme of glycolysis, phosphofructokinase.
Cancer cells maintain a high glycolytic rate even in the presence of
oxygen, a phenomenon known as the Warburg effect (Warburg, 1956). The
glycolytic rate in the placenta, another fast-growing tissue, is
accelerated by anoxia and by maternal diabetes.

By screening a placental cDNA library with human and frog liver PFKFB
(PFKFB1; 311790) as probes, Sakai et al. (1996) obtained a cDNA encoding
PFKFB3, which they termed HP (human placental PFKFB). The predicted
PFKFB3 protein, which is 61% similar to human liver PFKFB, contains 529
amino acids and 7 potential phosphorylation sites. Northern blot
analysis of first-trimester and term placentas detected a 4.5-kb PFKFB3
transcript.

Using SDS-PAGE analysis, Sakakibara et al. (1997) determined that PFKFB3
is expressed as a 58-kD protein. Molecular sieve analysis confirmed that
PFKFB3 is bifunctional, although the phosphatase activity was low due to
a mutation in an active site. The kinase activity was upregulated after
phosphorylation by protein kinases.

By screening a fetal brain cDNA library with bovine PFKFB as the probe,
Manzano et al. (1998) isolated a cDNA encoding PFKFB3. Northern blot
analysis detected a single PFKFB3 transcript of 4.8 kb in all tissues
tested, with strongest expression in muscle, kidney, lung, and brain.

By searching EST databases for sequences containing AU-rich elements in
the 3-prime untranslated region (UTR), Chesney et al. (1999) obtained a
cDNA encoding PFKFB3, which they called 'inducible PFK2,' or iPFK2.
Northern and Western blot analysis of lipopolysaccharide
(LPS)-stimulated monocytes showed rapid induction of PFKFB3 that
paralleled that of interleukin 1-beta (IL1B; 147720), which also
contains AU-rich elements. In contrast, the liver PFKFB isoform remained
at steady-state levels after LPS stimulation. PFKFB3 was also expressed
at high levels in tumor cell lines. Treatment with specific antisense
oligonucleotides could reverse the high expression in tumor cells and
shrink tumors in vivo. The authors concluded that PFKFB3 may be
responsible for sustaining the high glycolytic flux of rapidly
proliferating leukemia cells and may represent a molecular target for
chemotherapeutic intervention.

Using FISH, Nicholl et al. (1997) and Manzano et al. (1998) mapped the
PFKFB3 gene to 10p15-p14.

;;USH3A GENE; USH3A;;
USH3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By EST database searching and sequencing of the Usher syndrome type IIIA
(276902) critical region on chromosome 3q21-q25, Joensuu et al. (2001)
identified several genes, including CLRN1, which they called USH3A gene.
The USH3A protein has a cytosolic N terminus, 2 helical transmembrane
domains, and an endoplasmic reticulum membrane retention signal, TKGH,
in the C terminus. Northern blot analysis detected ubiquitous expression
of 3 USH3A transcripts of 4.5 kb, 1.4 kb, and 2.0 kb in adult human
tissues. RT-PCR analysis detected expression in retina. No expression of
USH3A was detected in human lymphoblasts by either method.

Fields et al. (2002) found that the USH3A gene encodes a deduced
232-amino acid protein. The mature form of the protein is predicted to
contain 3 transmembrane domains and 204 residues.

Adato et al. (2002) assembled a 500-kb genomic interval spanning the
USH3A gene and determined the full-length coding sequence of the USH3A
gene, expected to encode a 232-amino acid protein with 4 transmembrane
domains, which they named clarin-1. Adato et al. (2002) detected
expression of USH3A in retina, skeletal muscle, testis, and olfactory
epithelium. In mouse inner ear, expression was specific to the inner and
outer hair cells of the organ of Corti and to the spiral ganglion cells.

By sequencing CLRN1 clones obtained from a human retina cDNA library,
Vastinsalo et al. (2011) identified 10 alternative splice variants in
addition to the main variant, which contains exons 0, 2, and 3 and
encodes a 232-amino acid protein. Other transcripts containing ORFs were
predicted to encode proteins of 30 to 245 amino acids, and all but the
30-amino acid peptide have 1 to 4 transmembrane segments. Some splice
variants include premature stop codons and may be untranslated. EST
database analysis suggested that exon 2 may also be spliced onto
additional downstream exons. PCR analysis detected weak expression of
the main CLRN1 variant in most tissues examined. The variant encoding
the 245-amino acid protein was detected in retina, cochlea, heart,
brain, placenta, lung, skeletal muscle, pancreas, and ovary.

GENE STRUCTURE

Joensuu et al. (2001) determined that the CLRN1 gene contains 4 exons
spanning approximately 18 kb of genomic DNA. They also identified a
splice variant, designated isoform b, comprising an additional 87-bp
exon (exon 1b).

Fields et al. (2002) provided a revised structure of the CLRN1 gene,
including a new translation start site, 5-prime untranslated region, and
a transcript encoding a 232-amino acid protein. They stated that no
portion of exon 1, exon 1b, or exon 4 was present in their revised CLRN1
cDNA.

Adato et al. (2002) determined the genomic structure and alternative
transcripts of the CLRN1 gene. A longer transcript than those reported
by Joensuu et al. (2001) began with a newly identified exon 0, continued
with exon 2, had exons 3 and 4 transcribed together with their
intervening intron, but did not include the previously identified exons
1 and 1b.

Vastinsalo et al. (2011) determined that the CLRN1 gene contains at
least 8 exons, which they termed exons 0, 0b, 1, 1b, 2, 2b, 3a, and 3b.
Exons 3a and 3b are joined, along with the intervening intron, to form
exon 3 in the main splice variant. The region upstream of exon 1, which
is not transcribed in the main variant, contains a CpG island. Regions
upstream of exons 0, 1, 2, and 3 contain putative transcription
factor-binding sites. Functional analysis revealed that highest promoter
activity was associated with the region upstream of exon 0. A
pseudogene, CLRN1OS, is located on the opposite strand and has a 5-prime
UTR running in the opposite direction and overlapping the 5-prime UTR of
the CLRN1 gene.

GENE FAMILY

Adato et al. (2002) performed sequence database searches and identified
2 additional clarin-1 human paralogs: clarin-2 and clarin-3. No
orthologs were identified in the genomes of prokaryotes, yeast, plants,
nematodes, and insects, suggesting that this gene family is limited to
vertebrates. Four transmembrane domains, conserved sequence motifs, and
a single glycosylation consensus site between TM1 and TM2 characterized
the clarin family members, with a total of 14 identified clarins in
different species. In a wider context the clarins appeared to belong to
a large superfamily of small integral membrane glycoproteins with 4
transmembrane domains, including connexins and claudins, previously
shown to be involved in forms of deafness. The only protein showing
significant sequence similarity to the 3 clarins was stargazin, a
cellular synapse protein encoded by the CACNG2 gene (602911). Because of
the sequence homology to stargazin, Adato et al. (2002) suggested a role
for clarin-1 in hair cell and photoreceptor cell synapses.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Joensuu et al. (2001) mapped the CLRN1 gene to
chromosome 3q21-q25. Fields et al. (2002) stated 3q25 as the cytogenetic
location of the CLRN1 gene.

Fields et al. (2002) showed that the orthologous gene in the mouse is on
chromosome 3 and in rat on chromosome 2. They identified 2 human
paralogs on chromosomes 4 and 10.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Usher Syndrome Type IIIA

In 2 Finnish families reported by Sankila et al. (1995) and Joensuu et
al. (1996) and an Italian family reported by Gasparini et al. (1998)
with Usher syndrome type IIIA (276902), Joensuu et al. (2001) identified
mutations in the USH3A gene (606397.0001-606397.0003).

Fields et al. (2002) described 4 novel disease-causing mutations in the
USH3A gene, including one that appeared to be relatively common in the
Ashkenazi Jewish population (N48K; 606937.0004).

Adato et al. (2002) detected 3 USH3A mutations among 11 affected
individuals from 6 families with Usher syndrome type IIIA. They were a
missense mutation (606397.0004), a nonsense mutation (606397.0006), and
a 23-bp deletion (606397.0007), likely rendering clarin-1 functionally
inactive.

Aller et al. (2004) screened for mutations in the USH3A gene in Spanish
patients with Usher syndrome and found mutations in only 2 families.
They identified 1 patient with Usher syndrome type IIIA who was
homozygous for a C40G mutation (606397.0008). They noted that only 1
other mutation had been reported in the USH3A gene in Spanish families
with Usher syndrome (606397.0006). These 2 families accounted for only
1.7% of Spanish families with Usher syndrome.

- Retinitis Pigmentosa 61

In affected members of 2 consanguineous Pakistani families segregating
nonsyndromic autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (RP61; 614180),
Khan et al. (2011) identified homozygosity for missense mutations in the
CLRN1 gene (606397.0009-606397.0010), both of which occurred in a
transmembrane domain. Khan et al. (2011) concluded that these
RP-associated mutations might represent hypomorphic mutations, because
the substituted amino acids located in the transmembrane domains
remained polar, whereas more severe changes had been detected in
patients with USH3.

ANIMAL MODEL

Geng et al. (2009) developed a Clrn1 -/- mouse model for Usher syndrome
type IIIA. Clrn1 was expressed as early as embryonic day 16.5 in the
auditory and vestibular hair cells and associated ganglionic neurons,
with its expression being higher in outer hair cells than inner hair
cells. Clrn1 -/- mice showed early-onset hearing loss that rapidly
progressed to severe levels. Two to 3 weeks after birth (postnatal day
14 to 21), Clrn1-null mice showed elevated auditory-evoked brainstem
response (ABR) thresholds and prolonged peak and interpeak latencies. By
postnatal day 21, approximately 70% of Clrn1-null mice had no detectable
ABR, and by postnatal day 30, these mice were deaf. Distortion product
otoacoustic emissions were not recordable from Clrn1-null mice.
Vestibular function in Clrn1-null mice mirrored the cochlear phenotype,
although it deteriorated more gradually than cochlear function.
Disorganization of outer hair cell stereocilia was seen as early as
postnatal day 2 and by postnatal day 21 outer hair cell loss was
observed. Geng et al. (2009) concluded that CLRN1 is necessary for hair
cell function and associated neural activation.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
USHER SYNDROME, TYPE IIIA
CLRN1, TYR176TER

Fields et al. (2002) demonstrated that the Fin(major) USH3A mutation in
exon 3 of the USH3A gene, which had been identified by Joensuu et al.
(2001) as 300C-T (TYR100TER), should be referred to as 528T-G, resulting
in a tyr176-to-ter substitution. Joensuu et al. (2001) had identified
homozygosity for this mutation in a Finnish family segregating Usher
syndrome type IIIA (276902) and found it in a further 52 Finnish
patients. Fields et al. (2002) found this mutation in 11 of 28 mutated
alleles from affected individuals of Finnish and other northern European
ancestry.

.0002
USHER SYNDROME, TYPE IIIA
CLRN1, MET120LYS

In 4 Finnish patients from 2 families segregating Usher syndrome type
IIIA (276902), Joensuu et al. (2001) identified heterozygosity for the
Fin(major) mutation (606397.0001) and a T-to-A transversion resulting in
a met-to-lys substitution. Whereas Joensuu et al. (2001) referred to
this mutation, designated Fin(minor), as 131T-A (MET44LYS), Fields et
al. (2002) showed that this mutation should be referred to as 359T-A
(met120 to lys; M120K). The mutation occurred in exon 1 of the USH3A
gene.

.0003
USHER SYNDROME, TYPE IIIA
CLRN1, 3-BP DEL, 459ATT

In a consanguineous Italian family segregating Usher syndrome type IIIA
(276902), Joensuu et al. (2001) identified a 3-bp deletion in exon 3 of
the USH3A gene, resulting in the substitution of one methionine for
isoleucine and leucine. Fields et al. (2002) showed that this mutation,
referred to as 231-233delATT by Joensuu et al. (2001), should be
referred to as 459-461delATT.

.0004
USHER SYNDROME, TYPE IIIA
CLRN1, ASN48LYS

Of a total of 28 mutated alleles of the USH3A gene detected by Fields et
al. (2002) in patients with Usher syndrome type IIIA (276902), 11 had a
missense mutation, asn48 to lys (N48K), due to a 144T-G transversion in
exon 1. The mutation occurred only in Ashkenazi Jewish subjects and was
present in homozygous state in all except 1, in whom it was found in
compound heterozygous state with a leu150-to-pro mutation (L150P;
606397.0005).

Adato et al. (2002) detected the N48K missense mutation in 6 affected
individuals from 4 unrelated families of Eastern European Jewish origin.
Five patients were homozygous, while 1 patient carried the substitution
only on 1 allele and the second USH3A mutation was not detected. Shared
microsatellite and SNP haplotypes on carrier chromosomes suggested the
existence of a founder effect for this mutation.

In a cohort of 40 Ashkenazi Jewish patients with Usher syndrome, Ness et
al. (2003) found that the 16 (40%) who were clinically classified as
having Usher syndrome type III were homozygous for the N48K mutation.
The carrier frequency of N48K was 0.7% (95% CI = 0.0-1.6%) among
Ashkenazi Jews in the New York area, with a predicted Usher syndrome
type III prevalence of 1.2 per 100,000. Despite the genetic homogeneity
of Usher syndrome type III in this group, there was a wide range of
phenotypic severity displayed by the N48K homozygotes. Age at onset of
the auditory phenotype varied from infancy to more than 35 years. A
56-year-old woman had onset of the ocular phenotype in early childhood
ending with no useful vision, whereas hearing loss began after age 35
years, progressing to moderate to severe.

.0005
USHER SYNDROME, TYPE IIIA
CLRN1, LEU150PRO

In an Ashkenazi Jewish subject with type IIIA Usher syndrome (276902)
who was living in the United States, Fields et al. (2002) found that the
common Jewish mutation asn48 to lys (606397.0004) was combined, in
compound heterozygous state, with a 449T-C transition in exon 3,
resulting in a leu150-to-pro (L150P) mutation.

.0006
USHER SYNDROME, TYPE IIIA
CLRN1, TYR63TER

Adato et al. (2002) detected a 189C-A substitution, which was expected
to cause a tyr63-to-ter (Y63X) nonsense mutation in homozygous state in
3 sibs with Usher syndrome type IIIA (276902) from a nonconsanguineous
Spanish family.

Aller et al. (2004) stated that the family with the Y63X mutation
reported by Adato et al. (2002) could be diagnosed clinically as Usher
syndrome type I because hearing impairment was profound and stable.
Aller et al. (2004) considered that progressive hearing loss is not the
definitive parameter in distinguishing Usher syndrome type III from
Usher syndrome types I and II.

.0007
USHER SYNDROME, TYPE IIIA
CLRN1, 23-BP DEL, NT187

In 2 sibs with Usher syndrome type IIIA (276902) from a
nonconsanguineous family of Yemenite Jewish origin, Adato et al. (2002)
detected a 23-bp deletion in homozygous state. The deletion spanned
nucleotides 187-209 downstream from the first methionine codon, and was
predicted to cause a frameshift at amino acid 63 and stop codon after 25
amino acids.

.0008
USHER SYNDROME, TYPE IIIA
CLRN1, CYS40GLY

In a patient with type IIIA Usher syndrome, Aller et al. (2004)
identified homozygosity for a 118T-G transversion, resulting in a
cys40-to-gly (C40G) mutation in the USH3A gene. Both parents and an
unaffected sister were heterozygous for the mutation.

.0009
RETINITIS PIGMENTOSA 61
CLRN1, LEU154TRP

In affected members of a consanguineous Pakistani family with
nonsyndromic retinitis pigmentosa (RP61; 614180), Khan et al. (2011)
identified homozygosity for a 461T-G transversion in exon 3 of the CLRN1
gene, resulting in a leu154-to-trp (L154W) substitution in a
transmembrane domain. Subcellular localization studies demonstrated
retention of the mutant protein in the endoplasmic reticulum, whereas
the wildtype protein was mainly present at the cell membrane. The
mutation was not found in 81 unrelated Pakistani RP patients or in 90
ethnically matched control individuals.

.0010
RETINITIS PIGMENTOSA 61
CLRN1, PRO31LEU

In affected members of a consanguineous Pakistani family with
nonsyndromic retinitis pigmentosa (RP61; 614180), Khan et al. (2011)
identified homozygosity for a 92C-T transition in exon 1 of the CLRN1
gene, resulting in a pro31-to-leu (P31L) substitution in a transmembrane
domain. Subcellular localization studies demonstrated retention of the
mutant protein in the endoplasmic reticulum, whereas the wildtype
protein was mainly present at the cell membrane. The mutation was not
found in 81 unrelated Pakistani RP patients or in 90 ethnically matched
control individuals.

;;TRANSCRIPTIONAL COACTIVATOR p75; p75;;
LENS EPITHELIUM-DERIVED GROWTH FACTOR; LEDGF
TRANSCRIPTIONAL COACTIVATOR p52, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Transcriptional activation in human cell-free systems containing RNA
polymerase II and general initiation factors requires the action of one
or more additional coactivators. Ge et al. (1998) reported the isolation
of cDNAs encoding 2 novel human transcriptional coactivators (p52 and
p75) that are derived from alternatively spliced products of a single
gene and share a region of 325 residues, but show distinct coactivator
properties.

By immunoscreening a human lens epithelial cell cDNA library with
antibodies from a cataract patient, Singh et al. (2000) isolated a cDNA
encoding a protein that they named 'lens epithelium-derived growth
factor' (LEDGF). They determined that LEDGF is identical to p75, a
coactivator of both transcription and pre-mRNA splicing.

GENE STRUCTURE

Singh et al. (2000) found that the LEDGF gene contains at least 15 exons
and encodes LEDGF mRNA and p52 mRNA. Exons 1 through 15 encode LEDGF
mRNA; exons 1 through 9 and part of intron 9 encode p52.

GENE FUNCTION

Ge et al. (1998) demonstrated strong interactions of both p52 and p75
with the VP16 activation domain and several components of the general
transcriptional machinery. p52 is a potent broad-specificity
coactivator, whereas p75 is less active for most activation domains.

Ge et al. (1998) found that p52 interacts not only with transcriptional
activators and general transcription factors to enhance activated
transcription, but also with the essential splicing factor ASF/SF2 both
in vitro and in vivo to modulate ASF/SF2-mediated pre-mRNA splicing.
Immunofluorescence studies indicated that the majority of endogenous p52
is colocalized with ASF/SF2 in the nucleoplasm of HeLa cells. These
observations suggested that, in addition to functioning as a
transcriptional coactivator, p52 may also act as an adaptor to
coordinate pre-mRNA splicing and transcriptional activation of class II
genes.

Singh et al. (2000) observed that in serum-free medium, LEDGF stimulated
growth of lens epithelial cells, COS-7 cells, skin fibroblasts, and
keratinocytes, and prolonged survival of these cell lines. Antibodies
against LEDGF blocked cell growth and caused cell death. Singh et al.
(2000) concluded that LEDGF, a regulatory factor, might play an
important role in the growth and survival of a wide range of cell types.

Singh et al. (2000) found almost equal amounts of LEDGF/p75 and p52
expressed in lens epithelial cells in culture.

Nakamura et al. (2000) studied the effects of LEDGF on survival of
embryonic chick retinal photoreceptor cells under serum starvation and
heat stress. Immunohistochemistry detected LEDGF expression
predominantly in the nucleus of neuroretinal cells, including
photoreceptor cells. In the presence of LEDGF, photoreceptor cells
showed increased resistance to serum starvation and heat stress and
survived for longer periods. Levels of heat shock protein-90 (see
140571) were elevated in LEDGF-treated cells. Most retinal cells died in
the absence of LEDGF. They authors concluded that LEDGF enhanced
survival of retinal photoreceptor cells under serum starvation and heat
stress.

Machida et al. (2001) found that LEDGF protected photoreceptor structure
and function in both light-damaged and RCS rats (see 604705). However,
LEDGF failed to rescue photoreceptors in a transgenic rat model of human
retinitis pigmentosa (268000) carrying a P23H mutation in rhodopsin
(180380.0001).

Ciuffi et al. (2005) noted that LEDGF binds both chromosomal DNA and
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) integrase, suggesting that it might
direct HIV integration by a tethering interaction. They found that
treatment of kidney and T-cell lines with short hairpin RNAs to achieve
a strong knockdown of LEDGF resulted in a reduction of HIV integration
in transcription units (i.e., genes) compared with control cells.
Likewise, genes regulated by LEDGF were preferred integration sites.
Knockdown of LEDGF also resulted in increased HIV integration in
chromosomal regions with higher GC content, possibly due to LEDGF
binding preferentially in AT-rich chromosomal regions. Ciuffi et al.
(2005) proposed that LEDGF becomes enriched on genes by binding
components of the transcriptional apparatus, thereby positioning itself
to target HIV integration to these sites.

Llano et al. (2006) used intensified RNA interference and
dominant-negative protein approaches to show that the cellular
transcriptional coactivator lens epithelium-derived growth factor
LEDGF/p75 is an essential HIV integration cofactor. The mechanism
requires both linkages of a molecular tether that p75 forms between
integrase and chromatin. Fractionally minute levels of endogenous p75
are sufficient to enable integration, showing that cellular factors that
engage HIV after entry may elude identification in less intensive
knockdowns.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Cherepanov et al. (2005) reported the crystal structure of the dimeric
catalytic core domain of HIV-1 integrase complexed to the
integrase-binding domain of LEDGF at 2-angstrom resolution. The
structure elucidated the mode of recognition between the 2 proteins and
revealed a potential target site on the integrase for the design of
small molecule inhibitors to block the interaction.

MAPPING

By FISH, Singh et al. (2000) mapped the LEDGF gene to chromosome 9p22.2.
They noted that the 9p22-p21 region is the site of chromosomal
abnormalities in a variety of malignancies, including leukemia, glioma,
lung cancer, and melanoma.

145505	TITLE *145505 ACYL-CoA SYNTHETASE MEDIUM CHAIN FAMILY, MEMBER 3; ACSM3
;;SA, RAT, HOMOLOG OF; SA; SAH
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Fatty acids are incorporated into membranes and signaling molecules and
have roles in energy storage and metabolism. These essential functions
require activation of the fatty acid by acyl-coenzyme A (CoA)
synthetases, such as ACSM3, which form an activating thioester linkage
between the fatty acid and CoA (Watkins et al., 2007).

CLONING

Iwai and Inagami (1991) identified an mRNA species that showed markedly
higher expression in kidneys of spontaneously hypertensive rats than in
those of normotensive rats. Furthermore, the rat gene encoding this
mRNA, symbolized Sa, was shown to cosegregate with hypertension.

Iwai et al. (1994) found that the deduced amino acid sequence from the
isolated human SAH cDNA consists of 578 amino acids. Human SAH has
slight homology to bacterial acetyl-CoA synthase.

Using Northern blot analysis, Samani et al. (1994) demonstrated that the
SAH gene was expressed in human kidney.

By using mouse Sa to query a human database, Fujino et al. (2001)
identified ACSM3, which they called SA. The deduced 578-amino acid
protein has an N-terminal mitochondrial localization signal. Northern
blot analysis of mouse tissues detected Sa expression in liver and
kidney only. Subcellular fractionation and extraction of mouse kidney
homogenates revealed that Sa localized to mitochondrial matrix.

By searching databases for sequences containing acyl-CoA synthetase
motifs 1 and 2, Watkins et al. (2007) identified a splice variant of
human ACSM3. The full-length 586-amino acid ACSM3 protein contains 4 of
5 motifs characteristic of acyl-CoA synthetases. However, the deduced
438-amino acid isoform lacks motif 2 of the full-length protein,
suggesting that it may not function as an acyl-CoA synthetase.
Phylogenetic analysis revealed that ACSM3 belongs to a family of medium
chain acyl-CoA synthetases.

GENE STRUCTURE

Watkins et al. (2007) determined that the ACSM3 gene contains 14 exons.

MAPPING

By Southern analysis of somatic cell hybrids, Szpirer et al. (1993)
assigned the human SAH gene to chromosome 16. On the other hand,
Lindpaintner et al. (1993) pointed out that the human 11p15.5 region is
syntenic with the rat chromosome 1 linkage group that includes the Sa
gene. Samani et al. (1994) mapped the human SAH gene to chromosome
16p13.11 by FISH and somatic cell hybrid analysis. Fujino et al. (2001)
reported that the ACSM3 and ACSM1 (614357) genes are located within 150
kb of one another and are transcribed in opposite directions.

Iwai and Inagami (1991) showed that the rat Sa gene cosegregated with
hypertension and belonged to a linkage group previously assigned to
chromosome 1. Szpirer et al. (1993) independently assigned the Sa gene
to rat chromosome 1.

GENE FUNCTION

Fujino et al. (2001) showed that mouse Sa expressed in COS-7 cells
preferred isobutyrate among fatty acids with 4 to 16 carbon atoms. Sa
required ATP and CoA for activity. Radiolabeled carbon in isobutyrate
was found in CO2, indicating that the fatty acid was degraded by
oxidation. Fujino et al. (2001) concluded that the major function of SA
is to produce acyl-CoA for oxidation in the mitochondrial matrix.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Using the restriction enzyme PstI, Iwai et al. (1994) found a RFLP in
the SAH gene and compared allele frequencies between hypertensive and
control groups. The hypertensive group consisted of 89 persons, and the
PstI rare allele (allele A2) frequency in this group was 0.270. The
control group consisted of 81 healthy normotensive persons, among whom
the A2 allele frequency was 0.09. The differences were significant at
the P = 0.0001 level.

602287	TITLE *602287 ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM PROTEIN, 29-KD; ERP29
;;CHROMOSOME 12 OPEN READING FRAME 8; C12ORF8;;
ERp29;;
ERP28
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Reticuloplasmins are proteins found in the lumen of the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER). Demmer et al. (1997) cloned ERp29, a 29-kD
reticuloplasmin, from rat enamel cells by microsequencing of the
purified protein followed by RT-PCR. ERp29 has the N-terminal
hydrophobic signal sequence and C-terminal endoplasmic reticulum
retention motif (KEEL) characteristic of reticuloplasmins, but lacks
calcium-binding motifs. Northern blot analysis showed that ERp29 is
widely expressed in rat tissues. A homologous transcript was expressed
in human hepatoma cells.

Ferrari et al. (1998) cloned ERP29, which they designated ERP28, from a
human liver cDNA library. The deduced 229-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 24.8 kD and contains the KEEL ER retention
signal. The purified protein migrates as a dimer under nondenaturing
conditions and as a 28-kD monomer by SDS-PAGE. The same apparent masses
are seen with recombinant protein and protein purified from human
hepatocellular carcinoma cells or from bovine liver, indicating lack of
glycosylation. Ferrari et al. (1998) found that ERP29 shares 92%
sequence identity with the rat homolog. It shows low but significant
similarity with members of the protein disulfide isomerase family (see
176790), but does not contain a reactive thioredoxin-box motif.
Immunofluorescence and subcellular fractionation studies showed
colocalization of ERP29 with calreticulin (109091) in the ER.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the ERP29
gene to chromosome 12 (TMAP SGC31784).

605398	TITLE *605398 CHEMOKINE, CXC MOTIF, LIGAND 16; CXCL16
;;SRPSOX
DESCRIPTION For background information on chemokines, see CXCL11 (SCYB11; 604852).

CLONING

Using a 2-step EST database search in which putative transcripts were
scanned for the occurrence of functional patterns, Matloubian et al.
(2000) identified a cDNA encoding a CXC chemokine that they termed
CXCL16. The predicted 273-amino acid CXCL16 protein, which is 49%
identical to the 246-amino acid mouse sequence, contains a
non-glu/leu/arg (ELR) motif-containing CXC chemokine domain, a
mucin-like spacer region, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail
with a potential tyrosine phosphorylation and SH2 protein-binding site.
CXCL16 was the first transmembrane CXC chemokine identified; CX3CL1
(SCYD1; 601880), which also has a mucin-like spacer region, was the only
other known transmembrane chemokine. Northern blot analysis of mouse and
human tissues detected a 2.2-kb CXCL16 transcript in spleen, lymph
nodes, Peyer patches, lung, kidney, small intestine, and thymus, with
weak expression in heart and liver and no expression in brain and bone
marrow. Flow cytometry and Western blot analysis demonstrated expression
of an approximately 60-kD glycosylated cell-surface protein as well as a
cell supernatant 35-kD soluble protein.

By expression cloning from a phorbol ester-stimulated THP-1 cell
library, Shimaoka et al. (2000) isolated a cDNA encoding SRPSOX
(scavenger receptor that binds phophatidylserine and oxidized
lipoprotein). The deduced 254-amino acid type I transmembrane protein is
identical to the CXCL16 protein reported by Matloubian et al. (2000)
except that SRPSOX differs by 2 residues and lacks the N-terminal 19
amino acids. Immunoblot analysis showed that SRPSOX is expressed as a
30-kD protein in human and mouse macrophages. Northern blot analysis
revealed differentiation-inducible expression of 1.8- and 2.5-kb
transcripts in macrophages.

Wilbanks et al. (2001) cloned and characterized CXCL16. They concluded
that the alpha chemokine contains 254 amino acids and that efficient
secretion occurs without the long signal peptide predicted by Matloubian
et al. (2000). Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated expression of
CXCL16 on B cells and monocytes.

GENE FUNCTION

By flow cytometry of cells from mouse tissues, Matloubian et al. (2000)
found that CXCL16 was present on CD11C (ITGAX; 151510)-positive splenic
and lymph node dendritic cells; this expression was increased after
injection with lipopolysaccharide. Immunohistochemical analysis showed
that CXCL16 was expressed in T-cell areas of the splenic white pulp,
lymph nodes, the thymus medulla, and in the splenic red pulp; no
staining was observed in B-cell areas. After injection of inflammatory
mediators, expression was enhanced in T-cell zones and, more
prominently, in splenic red pulp. Chemotaxis assays found that CXCL16
induced a strong chemotactic response in activated CD8 T cells. In
addition, CXCL16 induced calcium mobilization. Human and mouse cells
expressing CXCR6 (605163) showed a strong chemotactic response to CXCL16
but not to other chemokines. Matloubian et al. (2000) concluded that
CXCL16 and CXCR6 probably function in interactions between dendritic
cells and T cells and in regulating T-cell migration in the splenic red
pulp.

Macrophages endocytose oxidized low density lipoprotein (OxLDL) by a
receptor-mediated mechanism. Shimaoka et al. (2000) found that cells
expressing SRPSOX bound to phophatidylserine-coated plates; this binding
could be inhibited by OxLDL. Scatchard analysis confirmed that SRPSOX is
a specific receptor for OxLDL but not LDL or acetyl-LDL. Fluorescence
microscopy demonstrated OxLDL uptake in SRPSOX-expressing cells.

Wilbanks et al. (2001) found that stimulation of macrophages with
lipopolysaccharide or TNF induced rapid shedding of CXCL16 into the
culture supernatant.

By transfecting human and murine cell lines with CXCL16 cDNA, followed
by treatment with specific ADAM inhibitors, Abel et al. (2004)
determined that ADAM10 (602192), but not ADAM17 (603639), is involved in
constitutive cleavage of the transmembrane adhesion molecule CXCL16 to a
soluble chemoattractant for activated T cells. Constitutive cleavage was
markedly reduced in Adam10-deficient mouse fibroblasts and was restored
by retransfection with ADAM10. CXCL16 induction in vascular cells was
dependent on synergistic activity of IFNG (147570) and TNFA (191160).
Abel et al. (2004) concluded that ADAM10 is the most relevant sheddase
of CXCL16.

Olszak et al. (2012) showed that in germ-free mice, invariant natural
killer T (iNKT) cells accumulate in the colonic lamina propria and lung,
resulting in increased morbidity in models of inflammatory bowel disease
(IBD; see 266600) and allergic asthma (see 600807) as compared with that
of specific pathogen-free mice. This was associated with increased
intestinal and pulmonary expression of the chemokine ligand CXCL16,
which was associated with increased mucosal iNKT cells. Colonization of
neonatal, but not adult, germ-free mice with a conventional microbiota
protected the animals from mucosal iNKT accumulation and related
pathology. Olszak et al. (2012) concluded that age-sensitive contact
with commensal microbes is critical for establishing mucosal iNKT cell
tolerance to later environmental exposures.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid analysis, Matloubian et al. (2000) mapped the
CXCL16 gene to 17p13, a locus separate from all other known chemokines.

Yan et al. (2010) mapped the mouse Zmynd15 (614312) and Cxcl16 genes to
chromosome 11. The genes are in opposite orientations with overlapping
5-prime UTRs.

605325	TITLE *605325 CYTOCHROME P450, SUBFAMILY IIIA, POLYPEPTIDE 5; CYP3A5
;;P450PCN3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CYP3A enzymes are the most abundantly expressed cytochrome P450 enzymes
in liver and are responsible for the metabolism of over 50% of all
clinically used drugs (Paulussen et al., 2000).

CLONING

By screening a liver cDNA library with CYP3A4 (124010) as probe, Aoyama
et al. (1989) isolated a cDNA encoding CYP3A5, which they termed PCN3.
Immunoblot analysis of liver microsomes showed that CYP3A5 is expressed
as a 52.5-kD protein, whereas CYP3A4 migrates as a 52.0-kD protein. The
deduced 502-amino acid CYP3A5 protein shares 85% sequence similarity
with CYP3A4. Analysis of enzymatic activity established that CYP3A4 and
CYP3A5 have overlapping substrate specificity with minor differences in
the metabolism of steroids and cyclosporine, suggesting that CYP3A4 may
bind these drugs at more than 1 site.

MAPPING

Jounaidi et al. (1994) isolated the 5-prime flanking region of CYP3A5
from a genomic clone on chromosome 7. Promoter analysis determined that
CYP3A5 uses a CATAA, rather than a TATA, box at positions -23 to -28 and
has a basic transcription element from -35 to -50. Jounaidi et al.
(1994) stated that CYP3A5 and CYP3A7 appear to be tandemly associated
and transcribed in the same direction.

Gellner et al. (2001) found that a 231-kb region on chromosome 7q21.1
contains 3 CYP3A genes: CYP3A4 (124010), CYP3A5, and CYP3A7 (605340), as
well as 3 pseudogenes and a novel CYP3A gene, which they termed CYP3A43
(606534).

GENE FUNCTION

Yamakoshi et al. (1999) isolated a cDNA clone for CYP3A5 from a prostate
library and determined that it has a unique 5-prime untranslated
sequence, suggesting that CYP3A5 is differentially regulated in liver
and prostate. Enzymatic analysis showed that the prostate form of the
enzyme can metabolize sex hormones.

Kuehl et al. (2001) stated that variation in the CYP3A enzymes
influences circulating steroid levels and responses to half of all
oxidatively metabolized drugs. CYP3A activity is the sum activity of the
family of CYP3A genes, including CYP3A5, which is polymorphically
expressed at high levels in a minority of Caucasians. Only individuals
with at least one CYP3A5*1 (wildtype) allele express large amounts of
CYP3A5. Kuehl et al. (2001) demonstrated that SNPs in CYP3A5*3 (6986A-G;
605235.0001) and CYP3A5*6 (a G-to-A transition in exon 7 resulting in
deletion of that exon), which cause alternative splicing and protein
truncation, result in the absence of CYP3A5 from tissues of some people.
CYP3A5 was more frequently expressed in livers of African Americans
(60%) than in those of Caucasians (33%). Because CYP3A5 represents at
least 50% of the total hepatic CYP3A content in people polymorphically
expressing CYP3A5, CYP3A5 may be the most important genetic contributor
to interindividual and interracial differences in CYP3A-dependent drug
clearance and in responses to many medicines. There are substantial
interindividual differences in CYP3A expression, exceeding 30-fold in
some populations. The polymorphic distribution of the wildtype CYP3A5*1
allele indicates that relatively high levels of metabolically active
CYP3A5 are expressed by an estimated 30% of Caucasians, 30% of Japanese,
30% of Mexicans, 40% of Chinese, and more than 50% of African Americans,
Southeast Asians, Pacific Islanders, and Southwestern American Indians.
The higher prevalence of CYP3A5 expression indicates that these
non-Caucasians are more likely to experience higher clearance of drugs
principally inactivated by CYP3A; are less likely to experience
dose-limiting toxicities; and have different risks of diseases that are
associated with the CYP3A5 expressor phenotype.

Kuehl et al. (2001) proposed that the expressor allele confers a
selective advantage in equatorial populations that may experience water
shortages. Thompson et al. (2004) genotyped the CYP3A5*1/*3
polymorphism, which is likely to influence salt and water retention and
risk for salt-sensitive hypertension (145500), in more than 1,000
individuals from 52 worldwide population samples. The results revealed
an unusual geographic pattern whereby the CYP3A5*3 frequency showed
extreme variation across populations and was significantly correlated
with distance from the equator. Furthermore, an unlinked variant, a
met235-to-thr SNP in the AGT gene (M235T; 106150.0001), previously
implicated in hypertension and preeclampsia, exhibited a similar
geographic distribution and had a significantly correlated frequency
with CYP3A5*1/*3. Thompson et al. (2004) concluded that variants that
influence salt homeostasis are the targets of a shared selective
pressure that results from an environmental variable correlated with
latitude.

Lee et al. (2003) identified 4 novel SNPs in the CYP3A5 gene producing
coding changes in different ethnic groups. R28C occurred in African
populations (allelic frequency, 4%), A337T occurred in Asians (allelic
frequency, 2%), L82R occurred in a racially unidentified group, and
F446S occurred in Caucasians (allelic frequency, 2%). These SNPs were on
an allele containing the CYP3A5*3 SNP. The newly identified allelic
proteins were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis, expressed in E.
coli, and purified. CYP3A5*1 exhibited the highest maximal clearance for
testosterone, followed by A337T, which was greater than R28C; R28C was
much greater than F446S. F446S exhibited a more than 95% decrease in the
intrinsic clearance for both testosterone and nifedipine oxidation, and
was predicted to be more catalytically defective than the splice change
alone.

The cholesterol lowering agents lovastatin, simvastatin, and
atorvastatin are metabolized primarily by CYP3A4; however, the
polymorphic CYP3A5 also contributes to the biotransformation of these
statins. Individuals carrying at least 1 copy of the wildtype CYP3A5*1
allele express CYP3A5 protein in the liver and some extrahepatic tissues
such as the small intestine, whereas CYP3A5*3 homozygotes are designated
CYP3A5 nonexpressors. Kivisto et al. (2004) studied whether expression
of CYP3A5 is associated with an impaired lipid-lowering response to
statins in 69 Caucasian patients. They found that lovastatin,
simvastatin, and atorvastatin were significantly less effective in
CYP3A5 expressors than in nonexpressors. No association between
hypolipidemic efficacy and CYP3A5 polymorphism was observed among 23
subjects taking statins that are not dependent on CYP3A5 (viz.,
fluvastatin or pravastatin).

HISTORY

Paulussen et al. (2000) analyzed what was thought to be the 5-prime
flanking region of the CYP3A5 gene and reported 2 linked polymorphisms,
-369T/G and -45A/G, located in transcriptional regulatory elements that
were associated with increased expression and activity of the gene.
Kuehl et al. (2001) noted, however, that sequencing of the CYP3A locus
revealed that these SNPs were actually in the promoter of the pseudogene
CYP3AP1, and thus could not be the basis for polymorphic CYP3A5
expression.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HYPERTENSION, SALT-SENSITIVE ESSENTIAL, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
CYP3A5, 6986A-G

In many populations, total adult CYP3A protein content of tissues
remains constant and consists largely of CYP3A4, whereas CYP3A5
expression has extreme interpopulation variability. This variation is
largely due to a 6986A-G substitution in intron 3 of CYP3A5 (the
CYP3A5*3 allele; SV1-CYP3A5) that results in improperly spliced mRNA and
a nonfunctional protein truncated at amino acid 102 (Kuehl et al., 2001;
Lin et al., 2002). The CYP3A5*3 allele is reported to have a frequency
of approximately 27 to 50% among African Americans, 85 to 95% among
whites (Hustert et al., 2001; Kuehl et al., 2001), and 60 to 73% among
Asians (Hustert et al., 2001).

Givens et al. (2003) found that, among renal microsomes from 21 organ
donors, those from *1/*3 individuals had at least 8-fold higher mean
kidney microsomal CYP3A5 content and 18-fold higher mean CYP3A catalytic
activity than did those from *3/*3 individuals (p = 0.0001 and p =
0.0137, respectively). They also found significant associations between
the 6986A-G polymorphism and systolic blood pressure (p = 0.0007), mean
arterial pressure (p = 0.0075), and creatinine clearance (p = 0.0035)
among 25 healthy African American adults. The associations remained
significant when sex, age, and body mass index were considered. The mean
systolic blood pressure of homozygous CYP3A5 expressors (*1/*1) exceeded
that of homozygous nonexpressors (*3/*3) by 19.3 mm Hg. Givens et al.
(2003) speculated that a high CYPA5 expressor allele frequency among
African Americans may contribute to a high prevalence of salt-sensitive
hypertension (145500) in this population.

Thompson et al. (2004) found that the CYP3A5*3 allele is significantly
correlated with distance from the equator. They noted that a
met235-to-thr SNP in the AGT gene (M235T; 106150.0001), previously
implicated in hypertension and preeclampsia, exhibited a similar
geographic distribution and had a significantly correlated frequency
with CYP3A5*1/*3. Thompson et al. (2004) concluded that variants that
influence salt homeostasis are the targets of a shared selective
pressure that results from an environmental variable correlated with
latitude.

605571	TITLE *605571 PIWI-LIKE 1; PIWIL1
;;HIWI;;
MIWI, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF; MIWI
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Self-renewing asymmetric division of germline stem cells (GSCs) in
Drosophila is controlled both by an intracellular mechanism and by
cell-cell interactions. Cox et al. (1998) cloned and characterized the
Drosophila piwi gene and showed that it is essential for GSC maintenance
in both males and females. Mutation in piwi causes differentiation of
GSCs without self-renewing divisions immediately following the
initiation of oogenesis. The piwi protein is highly basic, especially in
the C-terminal 100 amino acid residues, and is well conserved in
evolution. Cox et al. (1998) cloned 2 piwi-like genes in C. elegans that
are required for GSC renewal and also found sequence similarity with 2
Arabidopsis thaliana proteins required for meristem cell division. By
use of an EST with sequence similarity to the Drosophila piwi gene to
screen a human testis cDNA library, they cloned the human homolog,
PIWIL1. The deduced PIWIL1 protein shares 47.1% overall sequence
identity, and 58.7% identity within the C terminus, with the Drosophila
protein. Cox et al. (1998) found no piwi-related genes in the bacteria
and yeast genomes, suggesting that piwi has a stem cell-related function
only in multicellular organisms. Piwi and piwi-related proteins differ
in the N terminus but show high homology in the C terminus where they
all contain a conserved 43-amino acid domain, which the authors
designated the PIWI box. Cox et al. (1998) suggested that piwi-related
genes represent a novel class of genes required for GSC division in
diverse multicellular organisms.

By PCR of CD34 (142230)-positive hematopoietic cells, followed by
5-prime RACE of a testis cDNA library, Sharma et al. (2001) cloned
PIWIL1, which they called HIWI. PCR analysis of adult and fetal tissues
detected highest HIWI expression in adult testis, followed by adult and
fetal kidney. Weaker expression was detected in all other fetal tissues
examined and in adult prostate, ovary, small intestine, heart, brain,
liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, and pancreas. Semiquantitative RT-PCR
revealed HIWI expression in CD34-positive hematopoietic cells, and HIWI
expression diminished during differentiation. HIWI was not expressed in
C34-negative cells.

By 5-prime RACE of testis mRNA, Qiao et al. (2002) obtained a
full-length HIWI cDNA. The deduced 861-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 98.5 kD and contains a central PAZ motif
and a C-terminal PIWI motif. Northern blot analysis detected a 3.6-kb
HIWI transcript in testis only. RT-PCR detected low HIWI expression in
testis from a 7-year-old boy. In situ hybridization and
immunofluorescence labeling of adult testis revealed HIWI mRNA and
protein only in a subset of spermatogenic cells in transverse sections
of tubules. HIWI was not detected in basal germ cells of seminiferous
epithelium or in Sertoli cells. Expression of HIWI appeared to be
limited to specific stages of the seminiferous epithelial cycle.
Northern blot analysis showed upregulated HIWI expression in 12 of 19
seminomas. In contrast, HIWI expression was not increased in 10
nonseminomas and 4 spermatocyte seminomas.

Deng and Lin (2002) cloned a mouse Piwil1 cDNA, which they called Miwi.
Northern blot analysis revealed a major and a minor Miwi transcript in
adult testis, but not in any other adult or embryonic tissues examined.
In adult testis, Miwi RNA was detected in a small number of germ cells
at the basal layer of the seminiferous tubule, presumably in zygotene
stage spermatocytes, and expression was abundant in primary
spermatocytes. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed Miwi in pachytene
stage spermatocytes, and expression increased until the early round
spermatid stage, after which its abundance decreased. Western blot
analysis detected Miwi at an apparent molecular mass of 100 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

Sharma et al. (2001) found that transient expression of HIWI in a human
leukemia cell line resulted in a dramatic reduction in cellular
proliferation. Overexpression of HIWI led to programmed cell death.

Deng and Lin (2002) found that mouse Miwi complexed with mRNAs of Act
(605126) and Crem (123812) target genes.

Girard et al. (2006) showed that mouse Miwi bound a novel class of
approximately 29- to 30-nucleotide RNAs that were highly abundant in
testis. They named these RNAs 'Piwi-interacting RNAs,' or piRNAs, and
identified 52,934 candidate piRNAs. The distribution of piRNAs among
chromosomes did not correlate either with gene density or repeat
density. Nearly 84% of piRNAs mapped uniquely in the genome, and 17%
mapped to repeats, including SINES, LINES, and LTR retrotransposons.
piRNAs were predominantly grouped into 20- to 90-kb clusters, with long
stretches of small RNAs derived from only 1 strand. Similar piRNAs were
identified in human and rat, with major clusters occurring in syntenic
locations. Girard et al. (2006) proposed that the abundance of piRNAs in
germline cells and the male sterility of Miwi mutants suggests a role
for piRNAs in gametogenesis.

Grivna et al. (2006) found that Miwi associated with both piRNAs and
mRNAs in cytosolic ribonucleoprotein and polysome fractions of mouse
testicular extract. As polysomes increased in early spermiogenesis, Miwi
levels increased in polysome fractions. Moreover, Miwi associated with
the mRNA cap-binding complex. Examination of Miwi -/- testis revealed
that Miwi was required for expression of piRNAs and testis-associated
miRNAs. Immunoprecipitation of Miwi from mouse testicular extracts
coprecipitated Dicer (606241), but Miwi was not required for Dicer
expression or stability. Grivna et al. (2006) concluded that Miwi has a
role in small RNA-mediated processes during spermatogenesis.

Canalization, or developmental robustness, is an organism's ability to
produce the same phenotype despite genotypic variations and
environmental influences. Expression of a gain-of-function allele of
Drosophila Kruppel results in misregulation of genes in the fly eye disc
and generation of eye outgrowths, which are normally repressed via
canalization. Using a fly eye outgrowth assay, Gangaraju et al. (2011)
showed that a protein complex made up of Piwi, Hsp83 (HSP90; see
140571), and Hop (STIP1; 605063) was involved in canalization. The
results suggested that canalization may involve Hsp83-mediated
phosphorylation of Piwi. Gangaraju et al. (2011) concluded that the eye
outgrowth phenotype is a defect in epigenetic silencing of a normally
suppressed genotype.

Reuter et al. (2011) showed that Miwi is a small RNA-guided RNase
(slicer) that requires extensive complementarity for target cleavage in
vitro. Disruption of its catalytic activity in mice by a single point
mutation caused male infertility, and mutant germ cells showed increased
accumulation of LINE-1 retrotransposon transcripts. Reuter et al. (2011)
provided evidence for Miwi slicer activity directly cleaving transposon
mRNAs, offering an explanation for the continued maintenance of
repeat-derived piRNAs long after transposon silencing is established in
germline stem cells. Furthermore, Reuter et al. (2011) concluded that
their study supported a slicer-dependent silencing mechanism that
functions without piRNA amplification. Thus, Piwi proteins seem to act
in a 2-pronged mammalian transposon silencing strategy: one promotes
transcriptional repression in the embryo, the other reinforces silencing
at the posttranscriptional level after birth.

GENE STRUCTURE

Deng and Lin (2002) determined that the mouse Piwil1 gene contains 22
exons and spans 19.2 kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis and FISH, Sharma et al. (2001) mapped the
PIWIL1 gene to chromosome 12q24.2-q24.32. Qiao et al. (2002) mapped the
PIWIL1 gene to chromosome 12q24.33 by radiation hybrid analysis and
FISH. By genomic sequence analysis, Sasaki et al. (2003) mapped the
PIWIL1 gene to chromosome 12q23.

Deng and Lin (2002) mapped the mouse Piwil1 gene to a region of
chromosome 5 that shows homology of synteny to human chromosome 12.

ANIMAL MODEL

Deng and Lin (2002) found that Miwi-null mice were born at the expected
mendelian ratio and developed normally. Mutant males were sterile,
whereas mutant females were fertile. No sperm was found in the
epididymis of Miwi-null males, and spermatogenesis was uniformly
arrested at the round spermatid stage following the first wave of
spermatogenesis. Miwi-null testis showed increased numbers of apoptotic
cells from the basal layer to the luminal layer of the seminiferous
epithelium, suggesting that survival of spermatocytes, spermatids, and
possibly spermatogonia was compromised. Expression of Crem and Trf2
(TERF2; 602027) target genes was reduced in Miwi-null testis.

602931	TITLE *602931 MOTHERS AGAINST DECAPENTAPLEGIC, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, 6; SMAD6
;;MADH6;;
SMA- AND MAD-RELATED PROTEIN 6
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MAD-related proteins, named for Drosophila 'mothers against
decapentaplegic,' act as second messengers distal to the transforming
growth factor-beta family of receptors (e.g., TGFBR1; 190181).

CLONING

Using a differential display approach in cultured endothelial cells
subjected to multiple soluble and biomechanical stimuli, Topper et al.
(1997) isolated a human endothelial cell cDNA encoding MADH6, which they
called SMAD6. The predicted 235-amino acid MADH6 protein exhibits
significant sequence similarity to other human MAD-related proteins,
including the presence of a C-terminal MH2 domain; however, it lacks the
conserved N-terminal MH1 domain, and certain conserved C-terminal serine
residues that are involved in receptor-mediated phosphorylation. In situ
hybridization and immunohistochemical studies on human tissues showed
that MADH6 is expressed predominantly in vascular endothelium.

MAPPING

Riggins et al. (1996) reported an expressed sequence tag containing the
C-terminal sequence of MADH6. By PCR screening of a somatic cell hybrid
panel and YACs, they mapped the MADH6 gene to 15q21-q22.

GENE FUNCTION

Topper et al. (1997) demonstrated that MADH6 and MADH7 (602932) can form
complexes in endothelial cells. MADH6 was induced in cultured vascular
endothelium by fluid mechanical forces, and it modulated endothelial
gene expression in response to both humoral and biomechanical stimuli in
vitro.

Galvin et al. (2000) explored the role of an inhibitory SMAD in vivo by
targeted mutation of Madh6, which encodes the Smad6 protein, in mice.
Targeted insertion of a LacZ reporter demonstrated that Smad6 expression
is largely restricted to the heart and blood vessels, and that Madh6
mutants have multiple cardiovascular abnormalities. Hyperplasia of the
cardiac valves and outflow tract septation defects indicated a function
of Smad6 in the regulation of endocardial cushion transformation. The
role of Smad6 in the homeostasis of the adult cardiovascular system was
indicated by the development of aortic ossification and elevated blood
pressure in viable mutants. These defects highlighted the importance of
SMAD6 in the tissue-specific modulation of TGFB superfamily signaling
pathways in vivo.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 2 patients with bicuspid aortic valve and aortic valve stenosis
(AOVD2; 614823), 1 of whom also had aortic coarctation, Tan et al.
(2012) identified heterozygosity for missense mutations in the SMAD6
gene (602931.0001, 602931.0002). Neither mutation was found in more than
1,800 controls, and both mutants had significantly lower activity than
wildtype SMAD6.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
AORTIC VALVE DISEASE 2
SMAD6, CYS484PHE

In a man with bicuspid aortic valve, aortic valve stenosis, and
coarctation and calcification of the aorta (AOVD2; 614823), Tan et al.
(2012) identified heterozygosity for a nonsynonymous variant in exon 4
of SMAD6, resulting in a cys484-to-phe (C484F) substitution at a highly
conserved residue within the MH2 domain. The mutation was not found in
1,000 Caucasian controls of British ancestry, in 629 individuals in the
1000 Genomes project, or in 200 individuals in the Danish Exome Project.
Functional analysis demonstrated that the MH2 domain of the mutant
protein inhibited BMP (see 112264) signaling less efficiently than the
equivalent domain of wildtype SMAD6, with relative luciferase readings
that were 24-fold higher than wildtype. Tan et al. (2012) suggested that
C484F could be considered a null allele, since there was almost no
inhibitory effect on BMPR1A (601299) activity in the assay.

.0002
AORTIC VALVE DISEASE 2
SMAD6, PRO415LEU

In an infant with bicuspid aortic valve and moderate aortic stenosis
(AOVD2; 614823), Tan et al. (2012) identified heterozygosity for a
nonsynonymous variant in exon 4 of SMAD6, resulting in a pro415-to-leu
(P415L) substitution at a highly conserved residue within the MH2
domain. The mutation was not found in 1,000 Caucasian controls of
British ancestry, in 629 individuals in the 1000 Genomes project, or in
200 individuals in the Danish Exome Project. Functional analysis
demonstrated that the MH2 domain of the mutant protein inhibited BMP
(see 112264) signaling less efficiently than the equivalent domain of
wildtype SMAD6, with relative luciferase readings that were 7-fold
higher than wildtype, consistent with a hypomorphic allele.

;;MRG
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Dong et al. (2001) identified, in the mouse and human genomes, a family
of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) related to the MAS1 oncogene
(165180), including MRG. Several pseudogenes were also identified. The
predicted MRG proteins contain transmembrane, extracellular, and
cytoplasmic domains. A subset of MRGs was expressed in specific
subpopulations of sensory neurons that detect painful stimuli. The
expression patterns of these genes thus revealed an unexpected degree of
molecular diversity among nociceptive neurons. Some MRGs could be
specifically activated in heterologous cells by RFamide neuropeptides
such as NPFF and NPAF (see 604643), which are analgesic in vivo. The
authors concluded that MRGs may regulate nociceptor function and/or
development, including the sensation or modulation of pain.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Gehlsen et al. (1988) isolated a receptor for the adhesive basement
membrane protein laminin (150290, 150310, 150320) from human
glioblastoma cells by affinity chromatography on laminin. These RuGli
glioblastoma cells were later shown to be rat cells (Gehlsen et al.,
1988). This receptor has a heterodimeric structure similar to that of
receptors for other extracellular matrix proteins such as the
fibronectin (135620) and vitronectin (193210) receptors. Incorporation
of the laminin receptor into lysosomal membranes made it possible for
lysosomes to attach to surfaces coated with laminin.

Bignon et al. (1991) cloned 2 cDNAs for the human 67-kD laminin
receptor. They found that these clones hybridize to many restriction
fragments in Southern blot analyses in the human. The particular
patterns were accounted for by the presence of up to 16 and 21 copies of
the laminin receptor gene per haploid genome in human and mouse,
respectively. In contrast, a single gene copy was found in the chicken.

Yow et al. (1988) cloned a human colon carcinoma cDNA encoding a
laminin-binding protein. The cDNA hybridized to a 1.2-kb transcript, the
level of which was approximately 9-fold higher in colon carcinoma than
in adjacent normal colonic epithelium. The deduced 295-amino acid
protein has a highly negatively charged C-terminal segment and lacks
consensus sequences for an N-terminal signal sequence, amphipathic
alpha-helices, and N-glycosylation sites.

Satoh et al. (1992) cloned cDNAs encoding the 67-kD laminin receptor
from both a human lung cell line and a human lung cancer cell line. They
demonstrated that the level of the laminin receptor transcript was
higher in the lung cancer cell line than in the lung cell line.

Tohgo et al. (1994) found that the amino acid sequence of the rat 40S
ribosomal subunit is 99% identical to that of the human 68-kD
laminin-binding protein, indicating that the 40S ribosomal subunit is
identical to the 68-kD laminin-binding protein.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Jackers et al. (1996) localized
the LAMR1 gene to 3p21.3. Kenmochi et al. (1998) mapped the LAMR1 gene,
which they called RPSA, to 3p using somatic cell hybrid and radiation
hybrid mapping panels.

Bignon et al. (1991) identified laminin receptor pseudogenes on
chromosomes 3, 12, 14, and X. The features suggested that the laminin
receptor gene belongs to a retroposon family in mammals.

Lafreniere et al. (1993) demonstrated that a laminin receptor
pseudogene, which they symbolized LAMRP4, is located at Xq13 in a 2.6-Mb
segment that also contains the XIST gene (314670).

GENE STRUCTURE

The 37-kD precursor of the 67-kD laminin receptor (37LRP) is a
polypeptide whose expression is consistently upregulated in aggressive
carcinoma. It appears to be a multifunctional protein involved in the
translational machinery; it has also been identified as p40
ribosome-associated protein. Jackers et al. (1996) isolated the active
37LRP/p40 human gene. They found that it contains 7 exons and 6 introns.
Ribonuclease protection experiments suggested multiple transcription
start sites. The promoter area does not bear a TATA box but contains 4
Sp1 sites. The first intron is also GC-rich, containing 5 Sp1 sites.
Intron 4 contains a full sequence of the small nucleolar E2 RNA (RNE2;
180646) between nucleotides 4365 and 4516, and intron 3 contains 2 Alu
sequences.

GENE FUNCTION

Montuori et al. (1999) investigated the expression of integrin laminin
receptors in normal thyroid primary cultures; immortalized normal
thyroid cells (TAD-2); papillary (NPA), follicular (WRO), and anaplastic
(ARO) thyroid tumor cell lines; 7 thyroid tumors (4 papillary and 3
follicular carcinomas); and normal thyroid glands. Despite the presence
of several integrin laminin receptors, adhesion of TAD-2, NPA, and ARO
cells to immobilized laminin-1 was poor, whereas WRO cells and
follicular carcinoma-derived cells displayed a strong adhesion. Indeed,
WRO and follicular carcinoma-derived cells showed expression of a
nonintegrin laminin receptor, the 67-kD high-affinity laminin receptor
(67LR). TAD-2, NPA, and ARO cells as well as nodular goiter, toxic
adenoma, follicular adenoma, and papillary carcinoma-derived cells did
not express the 67LR. The expression in follicular carcinoma cells of a
functional, high-affinity 67LR, together with nonfunctional integrin
laminin receptors, could be responsible for the tendency of follicular
carcinoma cells to metastasize by mediating stable contacts with basal
membranes.

Chen et al. (2002) found that human normal and leukemic T cells produce
GNRH2 (602352) and GNRH1 (152760). Exposure of normal or cancerous human
or mouse T cells to GNRH2 or GNRH1 triggered de novo gene transcription
and cell-surface expression of the laminin receptor, which is involved
in cellular adhesion and migration and in tumor invasion and metastasis.
GNRH2 or GNRH1 also induced adhesion to laminin and chemotaxis toward
SDF1A (600835), and augmented entry in vivo of metastatic T-lymphoma
into the spleen and bone marrow. Homing of normal T cells into specific
organs was reduced in mice lacking GNRH1. A specific GNRH1 receptor
antagonist blocked GNRH1 but not GNRH2-induced effects, which was
suggestive of signaling through distinct receptors. Chen et al. (2002)
suggested that GNRH2 and GNRH1, secreted from nerves or autocrine or
paracrine sources, interact directly with T cells and trigger gene
transcription, adhesion, chemotaxis, and homing to specific organs.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Bolze et al. (2013) demonstrated that heterozygous mutations in the RPSA
gene cause autosomal dominant isolated congenital asplenia (271400) by
haploinsufficiency, revealing an essential role for RPSA in human spleen
development. Bolze et al. (2013) identified a nonsense mutation, a
frameshift duplication, and 5 different missense mutations. These 7
mutations were not identified in more than 10,000 alleles reported in
the 1,000 Genomes Project or the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project. The
missense mutations affected residues strictly conserved in mammals,
vertebrates, and yeast.

ANIMAL MODEL

Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD; 107970) is a
hereditary cardiomyopathy that causes sudden death in the young. Asano
et al. (2004) found a line of mice with inherited right ventricular
dysplasia (RVD) caused by mutation of the gene laminin receptor-1
(Lamr1). This locus contained an intron-processing retroposon that was
transcribed in the mice with RVD. Introduction of a mutated Lamr1 gene
into normal mice by breeding or by direct injection caused
susceptibility to RVD, which was similar to that seen in the RVD mice.
An in vitro study of cardiomyocytes expressing the product of mutated
Lamr1 showed early cell death accompanied by alteration of the chromatin
architecture. They found that heterochromatin protein-1 (HP1; 604478)
bound specifically to mutant Lamr1. HP1 is a dynamic regulator of
heterochromatin sites, suggesting that mutant LAMR1 impairs a crucial
process of transcriptional regulation. Indeed, mutant Lamr1 caused
specific changes to gene expression in cardiomyocytes, as detected by
gene chip analysis. Asano et al. (2004) concluded that products of the
Lamr1 transposon interact with HP1 to cause degeneration of
cardiomyocytes. This mechanism may also contribute to the etiology of
human ARVD. They noted that the human LAMR1 gene maps to 3p21 and that a
form of ARVD, ARVD5 (604400), maps to 3p23.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
ASPLENIA, ISOLATED CONGENITAL
RPSA, GLN9TER

In affected members of a Caucasian family from the United States
(kindred E) with isolated congenital asplenia (271400), Bolze et al.
(2013) identified heterozygosity for a c.25C-T transition in the RPSA
gene that resulted in a nonsense mutation, gln9 to ter (Q9X). The
mutation segregated in the mother and son and was presumably present in
2 other sibs who had died of overwhelming infection.

.0002
ASPLENIA, ISOLATED CONGENITAL
RPSA, 5-BP DUP, 590TCATG

In a mother and 2 sons (kindred C) with isolated congenital asplenia
(271400), Bolze et al. (2013) identified heterozygosity for a 5-bp
duplication in exon 5 of the RPSA gene (c.590_594dup) that resulted in
frameshift and premature termination (Pro199SerfsTer25). Cloning and
analysis of protein generated from activated T cells from patients
showed that less than 10% of the transcripts carried the mutation, which
suggested that mutant mRNAs were subject to nonsense-mediated decay. The
mother was Caucasian and the father was of Tamil descent from Reunion
Island. This family had been reported by Mahlaoui et al. (2011) as
family D.

.0003
ASPLENIA, ISOLATED CONGENITAL
RPSA, ARG180GLY

In affected members of 2 families (kindreds D and A) with isolated
congenital asplenia (271400), Bolze et al. (2013) detected
heterozygosity for a c.538C-G transversion in the RPSA gene that
resulted in an arg180-to-gly substitution (R180G). Haplotype analysis
indicated that the mutation arose independently in each kindred. In
kindred A, affected individuals occurred in 3 generations.

.0004
ASPLENIA, ISOLATED CONGENITAL
RPSA, ARG180TRP

In a Caucasian individual from Sweden (kindred T) with isolated
congenital asplenia (271400), Bolze et al. (2013) identified
heterozygosity for a 538C-T transition in the RPSA gene that resulted in
an arg180-to-trp substitution (R180W). Since neither parent carried the
mutation and the patient had 3 unaffected sibs, the mutation was
presumed to have arisen de novo.

.0005
ASPLENIA, ISOLATED CONGENITAL
RPSA, ARG186CYS

In a family of Congolese origin (kindred B) with 3 affected members with
isolated congenital asplenia (271400), Bolze et al. (2013) identified a
heterozygous c.556C-T transition in the RPSA gene that resulted in an
arg186-to-cys substitution (R186C). This family had been reported by
Mahlaoui et al. (2011) as family E and had been reported by Koss et al.
(2012) as having a causative mutation in the NKX2-5 gene (600584.0024).
The RPSA mutation segregated with the disease in a father and 2 sons,
one deceased; 3 other deceased sibs were probably affected. Koss et al.
(2012) presented a case report of this family. Three children died of
fulminant infection within the first year of life; they were not further
studied. A fourth child died of sepsis at age 23 months. Postmortem
examination of this child showed asplenia with normal heart and visceral
placement, and mutation analysis identified the P236H mutation. The
fifth child and the father, who both carried the mutation, were found to
have ICAS; the child was placed on prophylaxis, whereas the father did
not have a history of infections, suggesting incomplete penetrance.
Studies in mouse embryos and cellular studies of splenic mesenchymal
cells demonstrated a pivotal role for the NKX2-5 gene in spleen
development.

.0006
ASPLENIA, ISOLATED CONGENITAL
RPSA, THR54ASN

In 2 affected children with isolated congenital asplenia (271400) from a
Caucasian French family (kindred F), Bolze et al. (2013) identified
heterozygosity for a c.161C-A transversion in the RPSA gene that
resulted in a thr54-to-asn substitution (T54N). Since neither parent was
found to carry the mutation, inheritance was attributed to germline
mosaicism. This family had been reported by Mahlaoui et al. (2011) as
family B, and by Ferlicot et al. (1997).

.0007
ASPLENIA, ISOLATED CONGENITAL
RPSA, LEU58PHE

In an individual of French descent (kindred O) with isolated congenital
asplenia (271400), Bolze et al. (2013) identified heterozygosity for a
c.172C-T transition in the RPSA gene that resulted in a leu58-to-phe
substitution (L58F). The mutation apparently arose de novo.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a yeast 2-hybrid interaction screen with I-kappa-B proteins as
bait to identify interacting molecules, Fenwick et al. (2000) identified
NKIRAS1 (604496) and then screened expressed sequence tag (EST)
databases and identified a related protein, NKIRAS2, which they named
kappa-B-Ras2. The 191-amino acid NKIRAS2 protein has 71% identity to
NKIRAS1. In vitro translation revealed a protein of about 22 kD. NKIRAS2
is widely expressed and is encoded by a 2.5-kb mRNA.

GENE FUNCTION

Fenwick et al. (2000) showed that NKIRAS2 interacts with the PEST domain
of I-kappa-B-alpha (164008) and I-kappa-B-beta (604495) and decreases
their rate of degradation. In cells, kappa-B-Ras proteins are associated
only with the NF-kappa-B (see 164011):I-kappa-B-beta complexes; Fenwick
et al. (2000) suggested that therefore this may provide an explanation
for the slower rate of degradation of I-kappa-B-beta compared with
I-kappa-B-alpha.

;;SCRUIN-LIKE AT THE MIDLINE, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF;;
SLIM, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

By virtue of its interaction with proteins of varied function, KLHDC10
is predicted to influence several intracellular pathways, including
oxidative stress-induced apoptosis (Sekine et al., 2012).

CLONING

By sequencing clones from a KG-1 human immature myeloid cell line cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1996) obtained a partial KLHDC10 clone, which
they designated KIAA0265. The deduced protein contained 401 amino acids.
Northern blot analysis detected moderate KLHDC10 expression in skeletal
muscle, with lower expression in all other tissues and cell lines
examined.

By searching a human database for proteins similar to Drosophila Slim,
Sekine et al. (2012) identified KLHDC10. The deduced 442-amino acid
protein contains a large central kelch repeat domain, followed by
putative Cul2 and BC boxes. The kelch repeat domain is predicted to form
a 6-bladed beta propeller structure. The Cul2 box is predicted to bind
cullin-2 (CUL2; 603135) of the CUL2 ubiquitin ligase complex, and the BC
box is predicted to bind the CUL2 adaptor proteins elongin B (TCEB2;
600787) and elongin C (TCEB1; 600788). Epitope-tagged KLHDC10 localized
predominantly to the nucleus of transfected HEK203 cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Similar to their results with Drosophila Slim, Sekine et al. (2012)
found that human KLHDC10 was involved in activation of apoptosis
signal-regulating kinase-1 (ASK1; 602448) via its kelch repeat domain.
The activation of ASK1 by reactive oxygen species (ROS) is involved in
oxidative stress-mediated cell death. Overexpression of KLHDC10 and ASK1
in HEK293 cells resulted in activation of ASK1 and downstream effectors
JNK (see MAPK8, 601158) and p38 (MAPK14; 600289). Immunoprecipitation of
HEK293 cells revealed that KLHDC10 interacted with PP5 (PPP5C, 600658),
a protein phosphatase known to inactivate ASK1 via dephosphorylation of
an essential phosphothreonine. KLHDC10 interacted directly with the
phosphatase domain of PP5. Both H2O2 and TNF-alpha (TNF; 191160)
increased the binding between KLHDC10 and PP5. Knockdown of Klhdc10 in
Neuro2A cells reduced H2O2-dependent activation of Ask1 and p38, and
suppressed H2O2-induced cell death. Immunoprecipitation analysis of
mouse Neuro2A neuroblastoma cells revealed that endogenous Klhdc10 also
interacted with Cul2, elongin B, and elongin C, and that the interaction
requires a functional C-terminal BC box of Klhdc10. Knockdown of Cul2
increased the protein level of Klhdc10.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1996) mapped the KLHDC10
gene to chromosome 7.

Hartz (2013) mapped the KLHDC10 gene to chromosome 7q32.2 based on an
alignment of the KLHDC10 sequence (GenBank GENBANK D87454) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

;;SMS1;;
TRANSMEMBRANE PROTEIN 23; TMEM23;;
MEDULLA OBLONGATA-DERIVED PROTEIN; MOB
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Sphingomyelin (SM) is a major component of plasma membranes. It is
preferentially concentrated in the outer leaflet and has a role in the
formation of lipid rafts. SM synthases (EC 2.7.8.27), such as SGMS1,
produce SM through the transfer of phosphocholine from
phosphatidylcholine onto ceramide, yielding diacylglycerol as a side
product (Huitema et al., 2004).

CLONING

By database analysis and sequencing overlapping clones, Vladychenskaya
et al. (2002) obtained a full-length SGMS1 cDNA, which they called MOB.
The deduced 413-amino acid protein has an N-terminal SAM domain, 5
transmembrane domains, and an acid phosphatase-like domain that overlaps
transmembrane domains 4 and 5. The N terminus, including the SAM domain,
is predicted to be oriented into the cytoplasm. Northern blot analysis
detected a transcript of over 3 kb highly expressed in cerebellum and
forebrain cortex. EST database analysis suggested that MOB has more
widespread expression. Database analysis identified 3 MOB transcripts
that likely result from the utilization of alternative polyadenylation
sites. Phylogenetic analysis revealed 3 regions of conservation
corresponding to the region between transmembrane domains 1 and 2, the
sequence encoded by exon 4 including transmembrane domain 3, and the
acid phosphatase-like region.

By RT-PCR, Vladychenskaya et al. (2004) identified 2 MOB splice variants
in cerebellar RNA. A transcript lacking exon 7 encodes a deduced
214-amino acid protein missing the SAM domain and the first 2
transmembrane domains contained in the full-length protein. RT-PCR
detected both the long and short MOB transcripts more highly expressed
in cerebellum, hippocampus, forebrain cortex, and kidney than in spleen,
lymphatic tissue, or liver.

By searching databases for sequences encoding motifs characteristic of
SM synthases, Huitema et al. (2004) identified SGMS1, which they called
SMS1. They determined that the transmembrane domains are connected by
hydrophilic extramembrane loops and that SMS1 also contains 4 highly
conserved motifs designated D1 to D4. SMS1 was concentrated in the
perinuclear region and localized to the Golgi apparatus. Protease
protection analysis of transfected HeLa cells revealed that the C
terminus was cytosolic, indicating that the putative active site
residues are in the extracellular space. Northern blot analysis detected
low expression of a 3.8-kb transcript in human brain, heart, kidney,
liver, muscle, and stomach.

GENE FUNCTION

By heterologous expression in S. cerevisiae, Huitema et al. (2004)
showed that human SGMS1 formed SM in the presence of choline and
ceramide. Both phosphatidylcholine and SM itself were utilized as
phosphorylcholine group donors, but lysophosphatidylcholine was a very
poor substrate, and other donors, including other phospholipids, did not
support SM formation. Huitema et al. (2004) concluded that SGMS1
required 2 fatty chains on the phosphocholine donor molecule for it to
be utilized as a substrate. SGMS1 could also catalyze the reverse
reaction.

Using a mouse cell line deficient in SM synthase activity, Yamaoka et
al. (2004) demonstrated that human SGMS1 was able to restore both cell
growth in serum-free medium and the accumulation of SM at the plasma
membrane surface.

Carette et al. (2009) used insertional mutagenesis to develop a
screening method to generate null alleles in a human cell line haploid
for all chromosomes except chromosome 8. Using this approach, they
identified genes needed for the action of cytolethal distending toxin,
used by many pathogenic bacteria such as E. coli, Shigella dysenteriae,
Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Campylobacter jejuni, Helicobacter
spp., Salmonella typhi, and Haemophilus ducreyi. One gene implicated was
SGMS1. SGMS1 mutants were resistant to CDT, a phenotype reverted by
complementing the mutant cells with SGMS1 wildtype cDNAs. The SGMS1
mutation reduced levels of sphingomyelin, a key component of lipid
rafts. Depletion of SGMS1 activity disturbs lipid-raft function and
prevents receptor clustering, a trait of possible relevance for CDT
binding and/or entry.

GENE STRUCTURE

Vladychenskaya et al. (2004) determined that the SGMS1 gene contains 11
exons and spans over 320 kb. The first 6 exons are untranslated, and
exons 1, 5, and 6 also contain short putative upstream ORFs. The 3-prime
region contains 6 canonical polyadenylation signals and several possible
AREs. There are 2 putative promoters within a 1-kb fragment adjacent to
the 5-prime end of exon 1, and neither region contains a canonical TATA
box. Exon 1 is located within a 2.8-kb CpG island.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Vladychenskaya et al. (2002) mapped the
SGMS1 gene to chromosome 10q between markers D10S604 and D10S539.

138850	TITLE *138850 GONADOTROPIN-RELEASING HORMONE RECEPTOR; GNRHR
;;GNRHR1;;
GRHR;;
LUTEINIZING HORMONE-RELEASING HORMONE RECEPTOR; LHRHR
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GNRH; 152760), a hypothalamic
decapeptide, is a key neuroregulator of the reproductive process. It is
synthesized by hypothalamic neurons, secreted in a pulsatile manner, and
carried to the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland by way of the
hypothalamohypophyseal portal circulation. The primary site of action of
GNRH in the pituitary gland is the gonadotrope, the cell that expresses
GNRH receptors and secretes gonadotropic hormones, which in turn
regulate gametogenic and hormonal functions of the gonads. GNRH receptor
is a member of the G protein-coupled, Ca(2+)-dependent family of
receptors. Located on the cell surface of pituitary gonadotropes, GNRHR
transduces signals from GNRH and modulates the synthesis and secretion
of luteinizing hormone (152780) and follicle-stimulating hormone
(136530).

CLONING

Kakar et al. (1992) isolated a cDNA for the GNRH receptor and showed
that it encodes a protein with a transmembrane topology similar to that
of other G protein-coupled 7-transmembrane-domain receptors.

Grosse et al. (1997) used RT-PCR of human pituitary poly(A)+ RNA to
clone the full-length GNRHR gene and a second truncated cDNA
characterized by a 128-bp deletion between nucleotide positions 522 and
651. The deletion causes a frameshift in the open reading frame, thus
generating new coding sequence for a further 75 amino acids. The
truncated cDNA arises from alternative splicing that uses a cryptic
3-prime splice site in exon 2. Translation products of approximately 45
to 50 and 42 kD were immunoprecipitated from COS-7 cells transfected
with wildtype and truncated GNRHR cDNAs, respectively. The splice
variant was incapable of ligand binding and signal transduction.
Coexpression of wildtype and truncated proteins in transiently or stably
transfected cells, resulted in impaired signaling via the wildtype GNRHR
by reducing maximal agonist-induced inositol phosphate accumulation.
This inhibitory effect depended on the amount of splice variant cDNA
cotransfected and was specific for GNRHR. Coexpression of the wildtype
and truncated GNRHRs resulted in impaired insertion of wildtype GNRHR
into the plasma membrane.

GENE STRUCTURE

Using cDNA probes derived from a human pituitary cDNA library, Fan et
al. (1994) screened a human genomic library and isolated 7 positive
clones. The clones contained the entire protein coding region of the
GNRHR gene, which is distributed among 3 exons and spans over 18.9 kb.
The 2 introns, measuring 4.2 and 5.0 kb, were located within the open
reading frame, indicating that the GNRHR gene is a member of the
intron-containing class of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily.
Genomic Southern blot analysis demonstrated the presence of a single
copy of the gene in the human genome.

Fan et al. (1995) showed that the GNRHR mRNA is approximately 5 kb long,
of which 987 bp comprise the coding region. The gene appears to have
large 5-prime and 3-prime untranslated regions, including, respectively,
multiple transcription initiation sites and polyadenylation signals.

MAPPING

Kaiser et al. (1994) used mapping panels of human/rodent somatic cell
hybrids containing different human chromosomes or different regions of
human chromosome 4 to localize the GNRHR gene to 4q13.1-q21.1.
Furthermore, using linkage analysis of single-strand conformation
polymorphisms, they localized the murine homolog to mouse chromosome 5.
Using PCR analysis of DNA from human/hamster somatic hybrid cell lines,
Fan et al. (1994) assigned the GNRHR gene to chromosome 4. By in situ
hybridization using a biotinylated cDNA probe, Morrison et al. (1994)
localized the GNRHR gene to 4q13.2-q13.3. By fluorescence in situ
hybridization using a larger genomic clone as a probe, Leung et al.
(1995) apparently achieved a more precise localization of the GNRHR gene
to 4q21.2.

Kottler et al. (1995) isolated YAC clones containing the GNRHR gene.
Genetic analysis of the YACs showed that the gene lies between D4S409
and D4S392, which are located 76 and 77 cM, respectively, from the end
of the short arm of chromosome 4. Furthermore, by fluorescence in situ
hybridization, Kottler et al. (1995) demonstrated colocalization of
GNRHR with the KIT gene (164920), which has been mapped to 4q12. Kakar
and Neill (1995) mapped the gene to 4q13 by PCR analysis of genomic DNA
from human/hamster somatic cell hybrids combined with fluorescence in
situ hybridization.

GENE FUNCTION

The growth of sex hormone-dependent tumors is inhibited by analogs of
luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH; 152760). The use of LHRH
agonists for treatment of prostatic and breast cancer is based on
suppression of pituitary-gonadal function and the consequent creation of
a state of sex-steroid deficiency. In addition, LHRH agonists and
antagonists exert a direct effect on these tumors that probably is
mediated by specific high-affinity LHRH receptors found on these cells.
LHRH agonists and antagonists also suppress the growth of experimental
pancreatic cancers. Szende et al. (1991) demonstrated that pancreatic
tumor cells exhibit high-affinity binding sites for LHRH, but only in
their nuclei; low-affinity sites are associated with the cell membranes.
These binding sites appear to be LHRH receptors since electron
microscopic immunohistochemical studies show that an antibody to the
LHRH receptor reacted with sites in the nucleus of pancreatic tumor
cells.

Maji et al. (2009) found that peptide and protein hormones, including
GNRH, in secretory granules of the endocrine system are stored in an
amyloid-like cross-beta-sheet-rich conformation, and concluded that
functional amyloids in the pituitary and other organs can contribute to
normal cell and tissue physiology.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a family in which a brother and sister had idiopathic
hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH7; 146110), de Roux et al. (1997)
demonstrated that the affected individuals were compound heterozygous
for mutations of the GNRHR gene (see 138850.0001). Layman et al. (1998)
also demonstrated compound heterozygosity for 2 missense mutations in
the GNRHR gene in each of 4 affected sibs of a family (see 138850.0003).

Caron et al. (1999) studied a kindred with 3 sibs with isolated
hypogonadotropic hypogonadism who were genetic compounds for the
arg262-to-gln mutation (138850.0002) and an ala129-to-asp (138850.0004)
mutation that resulted in a complete loss of function. The 2 brothers
had microphallus and bilateral cryptorchidism and were referred for lack
of puberty; their sister had primary amenorrhea and a complete lack of
puberty. The authors concluded that these hypogonadal patients were
partially resistant to pulsatile GNRH administration, suggesting that
they should be treated with gonadotropins to induce spermatogenesis or
ovulation rather than with pulsatile GNRH. Kottler et al. (1999)
analyzed in detail the GNRHR mutations in 7 independent familial and
sporadic cases of idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism reported to
that time. The Q106R (138850.0001) and R262Q (138850.0002) mutations
were frequent in patients from all geographic areas (North or South
America or Europe).

To determine the frequency and distribution of GNRHR mutations in a
heterogeneous population of patients with idiopathic hypogonadotropic
hypogonadism, Beranova et al. (2001) screened 108 probands with
idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism for mutations in the coding
sequence of GNRHR. Forty-eight of the 108 patients had a normal sense of
smell, whereas the remaining 60 had anosmia or hyposmia (Kallmann
syndrome). Five unrelated probands (3 men and 2 women), all normosmic,
were documented to have changes in the coding sequence of the GNRHR. Two
of these probands were from a subgroup of 5 kindreds consistent with a
recessive mode of inheritance, establishing a GNRHR mutation frequency
of 2 of 5 (40%) in patients with normosmic, autosomal recessive
idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. The remaining 3 probands with
GNRHR mutations were from a subgroup of 18 patients without evidence of
familial involvement, indicating a prevalence of 3 of 18 (16.7%) in
patients with sporadic idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and a
normal sense of smell. Among the 5 individuals bearing GNRHR mutations,
a broad spectrum of phenotypes was noted, including testicular sizes
that varied from prepubertal to the normal adult male range. Three
probands had compound heterozygous mutations, and 2 had homozygous
mutations. Of the 8 DNA sequence changes identified, 4 were novel. COS-7
cells transiently transfected with cDNAs encoding the human GNRHR
containing each of these 4 novel mutations failed to respond to GNRH
agonist stimulation.

Janovick et al. (2002) showed pharmacologic rescue, assessed by ligand
binding and restoration of receptor coupling to effector, of 5 naturally
occurring GNRHR mutants identified from patients with hypogonadotropic
hypogonadism, as well as rescue of other defective receptors
manufactured with internal or terminal deletions or substitutions at
sites expected to be involved in establishment of tertiary receptor
structure. The pharmacologic agent used was a small, membrane-permeant
molecule, originally designed as an orally active, nonpeptide receptor
antagonist, but is believed to function as a folding template, capable
of correcting the structural defects caused by the mutations and thereby
restoring function. The rescued receptor, stabilized in the plasma
membrane, coupled ligand binding to activation of the appropriate
effector system. For comparison, low-, intermediate-, or high-affinity
peptide antagonists of GNRHR (that do not penetrate the cell) were
unable to effect rescue, as was a nonbinding peptidomimetic congener of
the rescue agent; this latter effect demonstrates specificity of the
rescue agent. Janovick et al. (2002) concluded that mutant GNRHRs
frequently have not lost intrinsic functionality and are subject to
rescue by techniques that enhance membrane expression.

Bedecarrats et al. (2003) analyzed 2 common mutations in GNRHR, gln106
to arg (Q106R; 138850.0001) and arg262 to gln (R262Q; 138850.0002), for
their effects on the stimulation of gonadotropin subunit and GNRHR gene
expression by GNRH. Despite similar impairment of GNRH-stimulated
inositol phosphate production, dose-response analyses indicated that
Q106R and R262Q both reduced the sensitivity of the FSH-beta (136530)
gene promoter to a greater extent than LH-beta (152780) or the
alpha-glycoprotein subunit (alpha-GSU; 118850), suggesting the
involvement of more than one signaling pathway. Furthermore, although
the sensitivities of the LH-beta and FSH-beta gene promoters to GNRH
were similarly affected by both mutants, alpha-GSU sensitivity was
decreased to a greater extent by R262Q than by Q106R. Similarly, GNRHR
gene promoter sensitivity was significantly reduced only by R262Q. The
authors concluded that differential stimulation of LH-beta, FSH-beta,
and alpha-GSU gene expression may contribute to the varied phenotypes
observed among patients harboring these mutations.

Leanos-Miranda et al. (2003) demonstrated that GNRHR mutants inhibited
the function of wildtype GNRHR, measured by activation of effector and
ligand binding. Inhibition varied depending on the particular GNRHR
mutant coexpressed and the ratio of GNRHR mutant to wildtype GNRHR cDNA
cotransfected. The GNRHR mutants did not interfere with the function of
genetically modified GNRHRs bearing either a deletion of
primate-specific lys191 or the carboxyl-terminal tail of catfish GNRHR.
The dominant-negative effect of the naturally occurring receptor mutants
occurred only for the wildtype GNRHR, which has intrinsic low maturation
efficiency. The data suggested that this dominant-negative effect
accompanies the diminished plasma membrane expression as a recent
evolutionary event.

To determine whether genetic variation within either the GNRHR or GNRH1
genes contributes to the regulation of pubertal timing in the general
population, Sedlmeyer et al. (2005) performed sequence analysis and
haplotype-based association studies in individuals with later than
average pubertal development. All observed associations were relatively
modest and only nominally statistically significant. The authors
concluded that genetic variation in GHRH1 and GNRHR is not likely to be
a substantial modulator of pubertal timing in the general population.

In 2 sisters with primary amenorrhea and no breast development at 25 and
18 years of age, respectively (146110), Seminara et al. (2000)
identified compound heterozygosity for Q106R on one allele and R262Q
(138850.0002) on the other. The apparently unaffected parents were
heterozygous for the mutations. Pitteloud et al. (2007) reexamined the
family studied by Seminara et al. (2000) and identified heterozygosity
for an additional missense mutation in the FGFR1 gene (136350.0016) in
the 2 sisters and in their father, who had a history of delayed puberty.
Mutation analysis of the children of the younger sister revealed that
her unaffected daughter, who had undergone normal puberty, was
heterozygous for the mutation in FGFR1 but had no mutations in the GNRHR
gene, and that her prepubertal 10-year-old twin sons, born without
cryptorchidism or microphallus, were each heterozygous for 1 of the
mutations in GNRHR but did not have any mutations in the FGFR1 gene.
Pitteloud et al. (2007) concluded that defects in 2 different genes can
synergize to produce a more severe phenotype in families with
hypogonadotropic hypogonadism than either alone, and that this digenic
model may account for some of the phenotypic heterogeneity seen in GnRH
deficiency.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM 7 WITHOUT ANOSMIA
FERTILE EUNUCH SYNDROME, INCLUDED
GNRHR, GLN106ARG

In a sibship in which a brother and sister had hypogonadotropic
hypogonadism (HH7; 146110), de Roux et al. (1997) found that the
affected persons were compound heterozygotes for a gln106-to-arg (Q106R)
mutation and an arg262-to-gln (R262Q) mutation (138850.0002) in the GNRH
receptor. The propositus was a 22-year-old man who was referred because
of hypogonadism. Puberty had occurred at the age of 16. His height was
180 cm and his arm span 186 cm. He reported impaired libido. Physical
examination revealed absence of facial hair, sparse pubic hair (Tanner
stage 3), and a penis of 6 cm. He had scrotal testes, and the volume of
each was 8 ml (normal, 15 to 25 ml). There was no gynecomastia. He had a
normal sense of smell and no mirror movements of the upper limbs, no
abnormal eye movements, no colorblindness, and no renal or craniofacial
abnormalities. The karyotype was 46,XY. The patient's older sister was a
37-year-old woman with a history of primary amenorrhea and infertility.
Spontaneous thelarche had occurred at the age of 14 years. She had a
single episode of uterine bleeding at the age of 18, and afterward
received combined oral contraceptive treatment. This treatment was
interrupted when she desired children. However, amenorrhea and absence
of pregnancy led to ovulation-inducing treatment, which resulted in 2
normal pregnancies and the births of a girl and a boy, 4 and 7 years old
at the time of report. After each pregnancy, she had persistent
amenorrhea, and oral contraceptive treatment was resumed. Her height was
165 cm. Pubic hair development was at Tanner stage 5, and her breasts
and external genitalia were those of a normal woman. Both parents and a
sister who was found to be heterozygous for 1 of the 2 mutations were
clinically and endocrinologically normal. A G-to-A transition at
nucleotide 317 was responsible for the gln106-to-arg mutation in the
first extracellular loop of the receptor.

De Roux et al. (1999) found this mutation in compound heterozygosity
with S217R (138850.0005) on the same allele and R262Q (138850.0002) on
the other allele.

In 2 sisters with primary amenorrhea and no breast development at 25 and
18 years of age, respectively, Seminara et al. (2000) identified
compound heterozygosity for Q106R on one allele and R262Q (138850.0002)
on the other. The apparently unaffected parents were heterozygous for
the mutations. Pitteloud et al. (2007) reexamined this family and
identified heterozygosity for an additional missense mutation in the
FGFR1 gene (136350.0016) in the 2 sisters and in their father, who had a
history of delayed puberty. Mutation analysis of the children of the
younger sister revealed that her unaffected daughter, who underwent
normal puberty, was heterozygous for the mutation in FGFR1 but had no
mutations in the GNRHR gene, and that her prepubertal 10-year-old twin
sons, born without cryptorchidism or microphallus, were each
heterozygous for 1 of the mutations in the GNRHR gene but did not have
any mutations in the FGFR1 gene. Pitteloud et al. (2007) concluded that
defects in 2 different genes can synergize to produce a more severe
phenotype in families with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism than either
alone, and that this digenic model may account for some of the
phenotypic heterogeneity seen in GnRH deficiency.

Pitteloud et al. (2001) described a 26-year-old male with a mild
phenotypic form of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, the fertile eunuch
syndrome (228300) (hypogonadotropic hypogonadism in the presence of
normal testicular size and some degree of spermatogenesis), associated
with a homozygous gln106-to-arg GNRHR mutation. De Roux et al. (1997)
had shown that this mutation, located in the first extracellular loop of
the GNRHR, decreases but does not eliminate GNRH binding. The proband
had hypogonadal testosterone levels, detectable but apulsatile
gonadotropin secretion, and a normal adult male testicular size of 17 mL
at baseline. After only 4 months of treatment with CG (see 118860)
alone, he developed sperm in his ejaculate and his wife conceived.
Following cessation of CG therapy, the patient demonstrated reversal of
his hypogonadotropism as evidenced by normal adult male testosterone
levels and the appearance of pulsatile luteinizing hormone (see 152780)
secretion. The authors concluded that this case expands the clinical
spectrum of GNRHR mutations, provides the first genetic basis for the
fertile eunuch variant of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, and documents
the occurrence of reversible hypogonadotropic hypogonadism in a patient
with a GNRHR mutation.

Costa et al. (2001) found this mutation in compound heterozygosity with
asn10 to lys (138850.0009). In vitro analysis indicated that the Q106R
mutation, located in the first extracellular loop, was able to bind
GNRH, but with a reduced affinity.

.0002
HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM 7 WITHOUT ANOSMIA
GNRHR, ARG262GLN

See 138850.0001 and de Roux et al. (1997). A G-to-A transition at
nucleotide 785 yielded the arg262-to-gln (R262Q) mutation in the third
intracellular loop of the GNRH receptor. Caron et al. (1999) detected
the R262Q mutation in compound heterozygosity with an A129D mutation
(138850.0004) in 3 sibs.

De Roux et al. (1999) found this mutation in compound heterozygosity
with Q106R (138850.0001) and S217R (138850.0005) on the other allele.

See 138850.0001 and Seminara et al. (2000).

Lin et al. (2006) reported a homozygous R262Q mutation in the GNRH
receptor in 2 brothers with IHH (HH7; 146110). The proband presented at
15 years of age with delayed puberty. After a short course of
testosterone, he seemed to be progressing through puberty appropriately
and was discharged from follow-up. His younger brother was also referred
with delayed puberty but showed little progress after treatment. Lin et
al. (2006) concluded that homozygous partial loss-of-function mutations
in the GNRHR such as R262Q can present with variable phenotypes,
including apparent delayed puberty.

.0003
HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM 7 WITHOUT ANOSMIA
GNRHR, TYR284CYS

In a screening of 46 unrelated patients with idiopathic hypogonadotropic
hypogonadism (32 males at least 18 years of age and 14 females at least
17 years of age) without anosmia (HH7; 146110), using denaturing
gradient gel electrophoresis of GC-clamped PCR products, Layman et al.
(1998) found 2 missense mutations in affected members of 1 family. One
was a CGG-to-CAG (arg262 to gln; R262Q) mutation in intracellular loop 3
(138850.0002); the other was a TAT-to-TGT (tyr284 to cys; Y284C)
mutation in transmembrane region 6. All 4 affected sibs were compound
heterozygotes for these mutations, whereas an unaffected sib and all 75
unrelated controls were normal. At least 1 of the affected females
ovulated with exogenous gonadotropins. The 2 GNRHR mutations had minimal
effects upon receptor affinity, but receptor expression was decreased
for both.

.0004
HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM 7 WITHOUT ANOSMIA
GNRHR, ALA129ASP

Caron et al. (1999) found that 3 sibs with isolated hypogonadotropic
hypogonadism (HH7; 146110) were compound heterozygotes for mutations in
the GNRHR gene. One mutation was a change of amino acid 129 from alanine
to aspartic acid (A129D), and the other was a replacement of arginine by
glutamine at amino acid 262 (R262Q; 138850.0002). The A129D change was
caused by a C-to-A transversion at nucleotide position 386. The father
was heterozygous for the R262Q mutation, the mother for the A129D
mutation.

.0005
HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM 7 WITH ANOSMIA
GNRHR, SER217ARG

De Roux et al. (1999) performed detailed endocrinologic studies in 3
affected members of a family with IHH (HH7; 146110) who had GNRHR
mutations. All 3 were compound heterozygotes for an arg262-to-gln
(R262Q; 138850.0002) substitution on one allele and gln106-to-arg
(Q106R; 138850.0001) and ser217-to-arg (S217R) substitutions on the
other. When expressed in heterologous cells, both the Q106R and S217R
mutations altered hormone binding, whereas the R262Q mutation altered
activation of phospholipase C (see 600810). The proband, a 30-year-old
male, had complete hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (146110) with extremely
low plasma levels of gonadotropins, absence of pulsatility of endogenous
LH and alpha subunit (see 152780), absence of response to GNRH (152760)
and GNRH agonist (triptorelin), and absence of effect of pulsatile
administration of GNRH. His affected 18- and 24-year-old sisters had
only partial hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. They both had primary
amenorrhea and normal breast development, but the younger sister had
retarded bone maturation and uterus development. Gonadotropin
concentrations were normal or low, but in both cases were restored to
normal levels by a single injection of GNRH. In both sisters, there were
no spontaneous pulses of LH, but pulsatile administration of GNRH
provoked pulsatile secretion of LH in the younger one. The authors
concluded that the same GNRHR mutations may exhibit varying degrees of
alteration of gonadotropin function in affected members of the same
family.

.0006
HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM 7 WITHOUT ANOSMIA
GNRHR, SER168ARG

Pralong et al. (1999) described a male patient with complete
hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH7; 146110) who presented primary
failure of pulsatile GNRH (152760) therapy, but responded to exogenous
gonadotropin administration. The patient had a T-to-A transversion at
codon 168 of the gene encoding the GNRH receptor (GNRHR), resulting in a
ser168-to-arg (S168R) change in the fourth transmembrane domain of
GNRHR. This mutation was present in homozygous state in the patient,
whereas it was in heterozygous state in both phenotypically normal
parents. When introduced into GNRHR cDNA, S168R resulted in complete
loss of the receptor-mediated signaling response to GNRH.

.0007
HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM 7 WITHOUT ANOSMIA
GNRHR, LEU314TER

Kottler et al. (2000) described a woman with complete hypogonadotropic
hypogonadism (HH7; 146110) and a new compound heterozygous mutation of
the GNRHR gene. A null mutation L314X leading to a partial deletion of
the seventh transmembrane domain of GNRHR was associated with the Q106R
mutation (138850.0001). The L314X mutant receptor showed neither
measurable binding nor inositol phosphate production when transfected in
CHO-K1 cells compared to the wildtype receptor. The disease was
transmitted by an autosomal recessive mode, and heterozygous individuals
with GNRHR mutations had normal pubertal development and fertility.

HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM 7 WITHOUT ANOSMIA
GNRHR, ARG139HIS

Costa et al. (2001) investigated 17 Brazilian patients (10 males and 7
females) from 14 different families with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism
and normal olfaction (HH7; 146110). The diagnosis of hypogonadotropic
hypogonadism was based on absent or incomplete sexual development after
17 years of age associated with low or normal levels of LH (152780) in
both sexes and low levels of testosterone in males and of estradiol in
females. All patients presented with a normal sense of smell in an
olfactory-specific test. In 1 female with complete hypogonadotropic
hypogonadism, Costa et al. (2001) identified an arg139-to-his mutation
(R139H), located in the conserved DRS motif at the junction of the third
transmembrane and the second intracellular loop of the GNRHR, in the
homozygous state. The R139H mutation completely eliminated detectable
GNRH-binding activity and prevented GNRH-induced stimulation of inositol
phosphate accumulation in vitro. The patient had undetectable serum
basal LH and FSH levels that failed to respond to GNRH stimulation.

HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM 7 WITHOUT ANOSMIA
GNRHR, ASN10LYS

In 4 sibs (2 males and 2 females) with partial hypogonadotropic
hypogonadism (HH7; 146110), Costa et al. (2001) identified a novel
compound heterozygous mutation, asn10-to-lys (N10K) and gln106-to-arg
(Q106R; 138850.0001). The Q106R mutation binds GNRH with a reduced
affinity; the N10K mutation, in the extracellular amino-terminal domain
of the receptor, also reduces the affinity for GNRH in vitro. Affected
patients with the N10K/Q106R mutations had partial hypogonadotropic
hypogonadism with low serum basal LH levels that were responsive to GNRH
stimulation.

HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM 7 WITHOUT ANOSMIA
GNRHR, GLU90LYS

In 2 sibs with the complete form of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH7;
146110), Soderlund et al. (2001) detected a novel homozygous G-to-A
transition at nucleotide 268 of the GNRHR gene, which resulted in a
glu90-to-lys (E90K) amino acid substitution. This mutation is located in
the second transmembrane domain of the GNRH receptor. To assess the
functional role of E90, Maya-Nunez et al. (2002) performed mutation
analysis of the E90K substitution. Transient expression of the mutant
receptor in COS-7 cells resulted in a virtual abolition of GNRH agonist
binding and agonist-stimulated phosphoinositide turnover, initially
suggesting that E90 may be essential for GNRH binding. To examine the
role of a site known to suppress GNRHR function, mutants with deletion
of K191 from the GNRHR and/or addition of catfish Gnrhr intracellular
C-terminal tail to GNRHR were prepared. Activation of intracellular
signaling in response to buserelin was restored by deletion of K191 from
the E90K mutant receptor but minimally by addition of the catfish GNRHR
C-terminal tail. This study provided evidence that the E90K mutation
impairs GNRHR-effector coupling. Maya-Nunez et al. (2002) concluded that
the observation that sequence modifications that enhance surface
expression of the receptor restore function presents the possibility
that loss of surface expression may underlie the severe phenotype
exhibited by hypogonadotropic hypogonadism patients bearing this
mutation.

.0011
HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM 7 WITHOUT ANOSMIA
GNRHR, IVS1, G-A, -1

Silveira et al. (2002) reported a woman with complete GNRH resistance
(HH7; 146110) secondary to a novel homozygous GNRHR gene mutation,
transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait. She presented with primary
amenorrhea and absent thelarche and pubarche. Dynamic tests demonstrated
absent spontaneous gonadotropin pulsatility, and no response to either
exogenous pulsatile or acute GNRH administration. However, she responded
to exogenous gonadotropin administration with a resulting normal
pregnancy. Analysis of genomic DNA revealed a homozygous splice junction
mutation, a G-to-A transition at the intron 1-exon 2 boundary. Her
unaffected sister was heterozygous for this mutation. Results of RT-PCR
analysis of RNA showed a transcript lacking all of exon 2, with splicing
of exon 1 to exon 3. This created a frameshift, generating a coding
sequence for 3 new amino acids followed by a stop codon. Although it is
not clear whether the mutant receptor was actually expressed, the
resultant mRNA sequence was presumed to produce a truncated receptor
with no binding or signaling capacity.

.0012
HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM 7 WITHOUT ANOSMIA
GNRHR, ALA171THR

In 2 brothers with severe hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH7; 146110),
Karges et al. (2003) found a G-to-A transition at nucleotide 511 of the
LHCGR gene that resulted in an ala171-to-thr (A171T) substitution at
transmembrane helix 4 (TMH4). After in vitro expression in human
embryonic kidney 293T cells, the A171T mutant LHCGR exhibited a lack of
phospholipase C activity in signal transduction. Specific receptor
binding of radioisotope-labeled GNRH ligand was undetectable in
transfected cells. Molecular modeling and dynamic simulation of the
mutant receptor suggested the introduction of a stable hydrogen bond
that impeded conformational mobility of the TMH3 and TMH4 domains
required for sequential ligand binding and receptor activation, thus
stabilizing the LHCGR in its inactive conformation.

.0013
HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM 7 WITHOUT ANOSMIA
GNRHR, ASN10LYS AND GLN11LYS

Meysing et al. (2004) reported a normosmic female subject with
congenital idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH7; 146110) in
whom treatment with pulsatile GNRH resulted in an unusual response. The
subject not only required an increased dose of pulsatile GNRH for
ovarian follicular development, but LH secretion did not increase
appropriately, estradiol levels remained low, and she did not ovulate
spontaneously. Sequencing of the GNRHR coding sequence revealed compound
heterozygosity for a 30T-A transversion in exon 1 of the GNRHR gene,
resulting in a 2-amino acid substitution on one allele (N10K+Q11K), and
a missense mutation on the other allele (P320L; 138850.0014).
Introduction of the P320L mutation into the GNRH receptor led to failure
of detectable ligand binding and failure of stimulation of inositol
phosphate production and gonadotropin subunit gene promoter activity in
response to GnRH in transiently transfected cells. Introduction of the
N10K+Q11K mutation into the GNRH receptor resulted in reduced binding of
a GNRH agonist to 25% of the wildtype receptor. In addition, the EC50
value for GNRH stimulation of inositol phosphate production was
significantly increased, and the dose-response curves for stimulation of
alpha-gonadotropin subunit (118850), LH-beta (152780), and FSH-beta
(136530) gene transcription by GNRH were similarly shifted to the right.
The authors proposed that these GNRHR mutations result in a rightward
shift of the dose-response curves of gonadotropin responses to pulsatile
GNRH in the subject and unmask the differential sensitivities of LH and
FSH to GNRH, resulting in low LH and estradiol levels despite
appropriate FSH secretion and follicular growth.

HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM 7 WITHOUT ANOSMIA
GNRHR, PRO320LEU

The patient with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH7; 146110) reported by
Meysing et al. (2004) was a compound heterozygote for a 2-amino acid
substitution on one allele of the GNRHR gene (138850.0013) and a 959C-T
transition in exon 3 on the other that resulted in a pro320-to-leu
substitution (P320L).

600690	TITLE *600690 T-CELL LEUKEMIA TRANSLOCATION-ASSOCIATED GENE; TCTA
DESCRIPTION Aplan et al. (1995) cloned a gene at the site of a t(1;3)(p34;p21)
translocation breakpoint in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. A cDNA
for the gene, designated TCTA (T-cell leukemia translocation-associated
gene), was identified from a human bone marrow library. The cDNA has a
short open reading frame of 103 amino acids. Northern blots showed the
gene was expressed ubiquitously with highest levels in the kidney. TCTA,
located at 3p21, is deleted in a subset of small cell lung cancer (SCLC)
cell lines. By comparative Southern blotting the authors detected
related sequences in the DNA of other mammals, chicken and Drosophila.

602927	TITLE *602927 G PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTOR 19; GPR19
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

O'Dowd et al. (1996) cloned a cDNA encoding a G protein-coupled receptor
(see 601805) that they designated GPR19. Sequence analysis revealed that
the predicted 415-amino acid GPR19 contains the 7 transmembrane domains
characteristic of GPCRs. It is most closely related to members of the D2
dopamine receptor family (see 126449) and the neuropeptide Y receptors
(see 162641). GPR19 is an intronless gene. O'Dowd et al. (1996) also
isolated genomic clones of the rat GPR19 homolog. By Northern blot
analysis, O'Dowd et al. (1996) determined that GPR19 is expressed as a
1.5-kb mRNA in human caudate nucleus, putamen, and thalamus, and as a
1.7-kb mRNA in rat brain and peripheral tissues. In situ hybridization
to rat brain sections revealed that GPR19 mRNA is expressed in a pattern
similar to that of the D2 receptor genes.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, O'Dowd et al. (1996) mapped the
GPR19 gene to 12p13.2-p12.3. Montpetit and Sinnett (1999) reported the
physical mapping of the GPR19 gene approximately 40 kb from CDKN1B
(600778). The following gene order was delineated: tel-ETV6
(600618)-CDKN1B-GPR19-cen.

INHIBITOR OF; PRKRI;;
PROTEIN KINASE INHIBITOR P58
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Korth et al. (1996) isolated a human p58 cDNA from a HeLa cell library.

GENE FUNCTION

The 58-kD inhibitor of the interferon-induced double-stranded
RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR; 176871) is a cellular protein that is
recruited by influenza virus to downregulate PKR, which in turn plays a
major role in mediating the interferon response to viral infection
(Korth et al., 1996). This represents an interesting example of how a
virus has evolved a mechanism to counteract the anti-viral interferon
pathway. The inhibitor protein, also called p58, may also play a role in
gene expression in uninfected cells and its overexpression in mouse 3T3
cells results in a transformed phenotype which rapidly forms tumors in
mice (Barber et al., 1995).

Gale et al. (1998) showed that P58(IPK) is inhibited through a direct
interaction with P52(rIPK) (607374), which in turn results in
upregulation of PKR activity.

MAPPING

Korth et al. (1996) mapped the PRKRI to 13q32 by fluorescence in situ
hybridization. The authors pointed out that changes in the structure and
number of chromosomes 13 are found in various cancers, including acute
leukemia.

;;METHYLENETETRAHYDROFOLATE DEHYDROGENASE/METHENYLTETRAHYDROFOLATE CYCLOHYDROLASE,
NAD(+)-DEPENDENT
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenases requiring either NADP or NAD as
cofactor are involved in the interconversion of methylene, methenyl, and
formyl derivatives of tetrahydrofolate. In mammals and yeast, the
NADP-dependent methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase, associated with
methenyltetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase in the N-terminal domain, is
fused to a formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase domain, forming a
trifunctional enzyme (see MTHFD1; 172460). The NAD-dependent
methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (MTHFD2) is a nuclear-encoded
mitochondrial bifunctional enzyme with methylenetetrahydrofolate
dehydrogenase and methenyltetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase activities.
MTHFD2 is unique in its absolute requirement for magnesium and inorganic
phosphate. Both ions affect the affinity of the enzyme for NAD and have
no effect on the binding of methylenetetrahydrofolate (Yang and
MacKenzie, 1993).

CLONING

By screening a cDNA library derived from a human colonic adenocarcinoma
cell line with a mouse Mthfd2 cDNA, Peri et al. (1989) isolated a cDNA
encoding human MTHFD2. The predicted 344-amino acid MTHFD2 protein
contains a 29-amino acid N-terminal mitochondrial leader sequence. The
mature human and mouse MTHFD2 proteins are 95% identical.

Schild et al. (1990) isolated a human cDNA clone complementing the yeast
mutation Ade-3 (formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase). However, the cDNA
clone was distinct by size and by restriction map criteria from that of
the MTHFD1 clone and was found to be the same as the mitochondrial gene
identified by Peri et al. (1989).

Yang and MacKenzie (1993) found that human MTHFD2 shares 44% amino acid
sequence identity with the dehydrogenase/cyclohydrolase domain of the
yeast mitochondrial NADP-dependent trifunctional enzyme encoded by the
MIS1 gene and 36 to 37% identity with the corresponding domain of the
cytosolic trifunctional enzymes from yeast, human, and rat.

Shannon and Rabinowitz (1986) purified and characterized a mitochondrial
isozyme from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the MTHFD2
gene to chromosome 2 (TMAP SHGC-168).

ANIMAL MODEL

Di Pietro et al. (2002) deleted the Mthfd2 gene in mice. Heterozygous
mice appeared healthy, but homozygous Mthfd2-null mice died in utero
shortly after embryonic day 12.5. Mthfd2-null embryos where smaller and
paler than wildtype or heterozygous mice, and mutant livers were pale
and contained fewer nucleated cells. Di Pietro et al. (2002) determined
that the paleness was not due to a defect in the formation of
hematopoietic progenitor cells, and lethality was not due to a failure
in mitochondrial protein synthesis.

612053	TITLE *612053 ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 36-LIKE 2; ZFP36L2
;;ZFP36-LIKE 2;;
EGF RESPONSE FACTOR 2; ERF2;;
TIS11D, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF; TIS11D
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ZFP36L2 is a member of the tristetraprolin (TTP, or ZFP36; 190700)
family of CCCH-type tandem zinc finger proteins. These proteins can bind
to transcripts containing AU-rich elements (AREs), resulting in
deadenylation and destabilization of bound transcripts (summary by
Ramos, 2012).

CLONING

Nie et al. (1995) cloned ZFP36L2, which they called ERF2, by screening a
human cDNA library using the mouse homolog, Tis11d, as probe. The
deduced 493-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 51 kD.
It contains a zinc finger domain, polyglutamine and polyproline tracts
that may act as transcriptional activators, a polyalanine tract, and 3
putative phosphorylation sites. Clusters of serine, proline, alanine,
and glycine account for nearly half of the ERF2 sequence. Human ERF2
contains 97 additional amino acids at its C terminus relative to mouse
Tis11d, but it shares 90% amino acid identity with mouse Tis11d prior to
the C-terminal divergence. The C-terminal end of ERF2 is highly
homologous to the C-terminal end of human ERF1 (ZFP36L1; 601064).

Ino et al. (1995) independently cloned ZFP36L2, which they called
TIS11D. The deduced 492-amino acid protein contains 2 zinc-binding
cysteine-histidine motifs. Northern blot analysis detected a 3.7-kb
transcript expressed at variable levels in all tissues and leukemic
cells examined.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ino et al. (1995) determined that the ZF36L2 gene contains 2 exons.
Except for the 3-prime UTR, the entire gene is GC rich. The promoter
region contains a GC box, a CAT box, and a CRE element. The 3-prime UTR
contains 5 copies of the ATTTA sequence, a characteristic of unstable
mRNAs.

GENE FUNCTION

Zhang et al. (2013) demonstrated that the RNA-binding protein ZFP36L2 is
a transcriptional target of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR; 138040) in
burst-forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E) progenitors and is required for
BFU-E self-renewal. ZFP36L2 is normally downregulated during erythroid
differentiation from the BFU-E stage, but its expression is maintained
by all tested GR agonists that stimulate BFU-E self-renewal, and the GR
binds to several potential enhancer regions of ZFP36L2. Knockdown of
ZFP36L2 in cultured BFU-E cells did not affect the rate of cell division
but disrupted glucocorticoid-induced BFU-E self-renewal, and knockdown
of ZFP36L2 in transplanted erythroid progenitors prevented expansion of
erythroid lineage progenitors normally seen following induction of
anemia by phenylhydrazine treatment. ZFP36L2 preferentially binds to
mRNAs that are induced or maintained at high expression levels during
terminal erythroid differentiation and negatively regulates their
expression levels. ZFP36L2 therefore functions as part of a molecular
switch promoting BFU-E self-renewal and a subsequent increase in the
total numbers of colony-forming unit-erythroid (CFU-E) progenitors and
erythroid cells that are generated.

MAPPING

Ino et al. (1995) mapped the ZFP36L2 gene maps to chromosome 6p21.3.
However, Hartz (2008) mapped the ZFP36L2 gene to chromosome 2p21 based
on an alignment of the ZFP36L2 sequence (GenBank GENBANK U07802) with
the genomic sequence (build 36.1).

ANIMAL MODEL

Ramos (2012) stated that female mice homozygous for a truncated form of
Zfp36l2 lacking 29 N-terminal amino acids could cycle and ovulate
normally and that their ova could be fertilized. However, when crossed
with wildtype males, their embryos were able to undergo the initial
cleavage step, but they arrested at the 2-cell stage. Ramos (2012) found
that the truncation, which deletes an unconventional leucine-rich
repeat, stabilized mutant Zfp36l2 against lipopolysaccharide-induced
degradation when expressed in bone marrow-derived macrophages. Truncated
Zfp36l2 was indistinguishable from wildtype Zfp36l2 in all other
measures examined, including cellular localization, binding to RNAs
containing AREs, and deadenylation of a model ARE transcript.

602572	TITLE *602572 ANNEXIN A11; ANXA11
;;ANNEXIN XI; ANX11;;
AUTOANTIGEN, 56-KD
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ANXA11 is a member of the annexin family of calcium-dependent
phospholipid-binding proteins. Annexins have unique N-terminal domains
and homologous C-terminal domains containing the calcium-dependent
phospholipid-binding sites.

CLONING

To identify a 56-kD antigen recognized by sera from patients with
autoimmune diseases, Misaki et al. (1994) screened a human
teratocarcinoma cDNA expression library with the anti-56-kD antigen
autoantibodies. They isolated a cDNA predicting a 505-amino acid protein
with 60% identity to other annexins in the conserved C-terminal domain
and 92.5% identity to bovine annexin XI over the entire protein. Misaki
et al. (1994) concluded that the 56-kD autoantigen is human annexin XI,
or ANXA11.

GENE STRUCTURE

Bances et al. (2000) determined that the mouse Anxa11 gene contains 15
exons and spans 40 kB. Exon 1 is untranslated, and intron 1 spans about
20 kb. The human ANXA11 gene has the same general structure as the mouse
gene; however, EST database analysis indicated that human ANXA11
transcripts also use variably spliced exons 1b and 1c, which can
lengthen the 5-prime UTR. The intronic sequences of the mouse and human
ANXA11 genes contain several types of repetitive elements, including
retroviral long terminal repeats. The mouse promoter region contains a
remnant LINE-1 insertion not found in the human gene. The 5-prime
flanking region of the ANXA11 gene contains a CpG island and MYOD
(159970), SP1 (189906), and glucocorticoid response elements, but no
proximal TATA or CAAT boxes.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

For discussion of a possible association between variation in the ANXA11
gene and susceptibility to sarcoidosis, see SS3 (612388).

MAPPING

Morgan et al. (1998) mapped the ANXA11 gene to 10q22.3-q23.1 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization.

By genomic sequence analysis, Bances et al. (2000) mapped the mouse
Anxa11 gene to chromosome 14.

DESCRIPTION The bacterial enzyme 3-methyladenine (3MeA) DNA glycosylase repairs the
lethal lesion 3MeA that blocks DNA replication in Escherichia coli. The
removal of 3MeA is mediated by two 3MeA DNA glycosylases in E. coli,
encoded by the alkA and tag genes. Using a human cDNA library cloned
into a bacterial expression vector, Boosalis et al. (1991) cloned a
1.15-kb cDNA that rescued alkA(-) tag(-) glycosylase-deficient E. coli
from alkylation-induced killing, and produced a 5-fold increase in 3MeA
DNA glycosylase activity in the E. coli strain. The cDNA hybridized to
human genomic DNA but did not hybridize to E. coli or yeast DNA. DNA
sequence analysis defined an open reading frame coding for a 33-kD
protein that showed extensive amino acid homology with rat 3MeA DNA
glycosylase. The gene (designated N-methylpurine DNA glycosylase, MPG)
was mapped to human chromosome 16 by analysis of a panel of DNAs from
mouse/human and hamster/human hybrid cell lines. Samson et al. (1991)
suggested that because of the 85% identity of 1 part of the human
glycosylase with the middle of the rat glycosylase polypeptide and,
hence, the likely common origin of the rat and human glycosylases, the
human gene should be called AAG for 3-alkyladenine DNA glycosylase.
Vickers et al. (1993) also isolated a cDNA corresponding to the human
MPG gene. They showed that the gene comprises 5 exons and lies within a
group of closely spaced genes in the terminal region of chromosome 16p.
The MPG gene was expressed in all cell lines and tissues examined, but
was found at particularly high levels in a colon adenocarcinoma cell
line (HT29). The completely characterized human MPG gene was found to
span 7 to 8 kb of genomic DNA and to be localized 75 kb upstream of the
embryonic zeta-globin gene (HBZ; 142310).

Kielman et al. (1995) described the genomic organization of the mouse
Mpg gene. Preliminary analyses by Kielman et al. (1993) and Kielman et
al. (1994) indicated that as in the human, the gene is upstream of the
alpha-globin gene cluster on mouse chromosome 11.

The human enzyme 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase removes a diverse group
of damaged bases from DNA, including cytotoxic and mutagenic alkylation
adducts of purines. Lau et al. (1998) reported the crystal structure of
human 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase complexed to a mechanism-based
pyrrolidine inhibitor. The enzyme had intercalated into the minor groove
of DNA, causing the abasic pyrrolidine nucleotide to flip into the
enzyme active site, where a bound water was poised for nucleophilic
attack.

ANIMAL MODEL

By targeted homologous recombination, Engelward et al. (1997) generated
mice deficient in the 3MeA DNA glycosylase encoded by the Aag gene. In
several mouse tissues, the Aag gene product appears to be the only DNA
glycosylase that is active against 3MeA, hypoxanthine, and
1,N6-ethenoadenine. Although the Aag protein has the capacity to remove
8-oxoguanine DNA lesions, it does not appear to be the major glycosylase
for 8-oxoguanine repair.

To assess the contribution of Apng to the repair of several mutagenic
lesions in vivo, Hang et al. (1997) biochemically analyzed cell-free
extracts of tissues from mice with a targeted deletion of the Apng gene.
They found that both 1,N6-ethenoadenine and hypoxanthine are substrates
for Apng, but 3,N4-ethenocytosine and 8-oxoguanine are not.

Elder et al. (1998) developed mice deficient in
alkylpurine-DNA-N-glycosylase by targeted disruption. Following
treatment with DNA-methylating agents, increased persistence of
7-methylguanine (meG) was found in liver sections of APNG knockout mice
in comparison with wildtype mice, demonstrating an in vivo phenotype for
the APNG-null animals. Unlike other null mutants of the basic excision
repair pathway, the APNG knockout mice exhibited a very mild phenotype,
showed no outward abnormalities, were fertile, and had an apparently
normal life span. Neither a difference in the number of leukocytes in
peripheral blood nor a difference in the number of bone marrow
polychromatic erythrocytes was found when knockout and wildtype mice
were exposed to methylating or chloroethylating agents. Treatment with
methyl methanesulfonate resulted in 3- to 4-fold more HPRT (308000)
mutations in splenic T lymphocytes from APNG knockout mice than in those
from wildtype mice. These mutations were predominantly single-basepair
changes that most likely were caused by 3-meA and 3- or 7-meG,
respectively.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Ecto-5-prime-nucleotidase (5-prime-ribonucleotide phosphohydrolase; EC
3.1.3.5) catalyzes the conversion at neutral pH of purine 5-prime
mononucleotides to nucleosides, the preferred substrate being AMP. The
enzyme consists of a dimer of 2 identical 70-kD subunits bound by a
glycosyl phosphatidyl inositol linkage to the external face of the
plasma membrane. The enzyme is used as a marker of lymphocyte
differentiation. Consequently, a deficiency of NT5 occurs in a variety
of immunodeficiency diseases (e.g., see 102700, 300755). Other forms of
5-prime nucleotidase exist in the cytoplasm and lysosomes and can be
distinguished from ecto-NT5 by their substrate affinities, requirement
for divalent magnesium ion, activation by ATP, and inhibition by
inorganic phosphate.

CLONING

Misumi et al. (1990) cloned and sequenced a cDNA for placental
5-prime-nucleotidase.

MAPPING

In human-Chinese hamster hybrids, Boyle et al. (1988) found a 100%
correlation between NT5 enzyme activity and presence of human chromosome
6. The correlation was confirmed by study of hybrid cells containing
chromosome 6 which were stained by indirect immunofluorescence for HLA
class 1 antigen and sorted by a fluorescence-activated cell sorter.
Cells that were HLA negative were also NT5 negative; cells that were HLA
positive were NT5 positive. Boyle et al. (1989) regionalized the NT5
gene to 6q14-q21 by study of a panel of human-mouse hybrids that
contained fragments of chromosome 6 as translocations.

GENE FUNCTION

Adrian et al. (2000) analyzed the expression of several purinergic
receptors, as well as CD73 and CD39 (ENTPD1; 601752), during
differentiation in a promyelocytic leukemia cell line. Granulocytic
differentiation was induced by dimethylsulfoxide, and a
monocytic/macrophage phenotype was induced by phorbol esters. CD73
expression was hardly detectable in undifferentiated cells and following
granulocyte differentiation. Monocytic differentiation resulted in a
marked upregulation of CD73 mRNA. Low expression was detected in normal
blood leukocytes.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 5 affected sibs from a consanguineous family of English descent with
calcifications of arteries and joints mapping to chromosome 6q14
(211800), St. Hilaire et al. (2011) analyzed 3 candidate genes and
identified homozygosity for a nonsense mutation in the NT5E gene (S221X;
129190.0001). Analysis of NT5E in 3 affected Italian sisters revealed
homozygosity for a missense mutation (C358Y; 129190.0002), and the
proband from a third family was found to be a compound heterozygote for
S221X and a frameshift mutation (129190.0003). St. Hilaire et al. (2011)
noted that CD73 participates in the extracellular pathway that converts
ATP to adenosine on the surface of various types of cells. ENPP1
(173335) produces AMP and pyrophosphate from ATP; then CD73 produces
adenosine and inorganic phosphate from AMP. Mutation in the ENPP1 gene
causes generalized arterial calcification of infancy (208000).

ANIMAL MODEL

Adenosine mediates the renal tubuloglomerular feedback-induced vascular
response elicited by changes in the NaCl concentration (Sun et al.,
2001; see adenosine A1 receptor, 102775). To determine whether adenosine
formation depends on extracellular nucleotide hydrolysis, Castrop et al.
(2004) generated mice with a targeted deletion of
ecto-5-prime-nucleotidase. There was no difference in blood pressure,
blood and urine chemistry, and renal blood flow between null and
wildtype mice; however, whereas tubuloglomerular feedback responses did
not change significantly during prolonged loop of Henle perfusion in
wildtype mice, a complete disappearance of the residual feedback
response was noted in null mice over 10 minutes of perfusion. Castrop et
al. (2004) concluded that the generation of adenosine at the glomerular
pole depends to a major extent on ecto-5-prime-nucleotidase-mediated
dephosphorylation of 5-prime-AMP.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CALCIFICATION OF JOINTS AND ARTERIES
NT5E, SER221TER

In 5 affected sibs from a consanguineous family of English descent with
calcification of arteries and joints (211800), St. Hilaire et al. (2011)
identified homozygosity for a 662C-A transversion in exon 3 of the NT5E
gene, resulting in a ser221-to-ter (S221X) substitution. The unaffected
third-cousin parents were heterozygous for the mutation, which was not
found in 400 alleles from ethnically matched controls. Cultured
fibroblasts from affected family members showed markedly reduced
expression of NT5E mRNA, CD73 protein, and enzyme activity, as well as
increased alkaline phosphatase levels and accumulated calcium phosphate
crystals; rescue using a CD73-encoding lentiviral vector resulted in
normalized CD73 and alkaline phosphatase activity. In another proband
with calcification of arteries and joints, St. Hilaire et al. (2011)
identified compound heterozygosity for the S221X mutation and a
frameshift mutation in the NT5E gene (129190.0003).

.0002
CALCIFICATION OF JOINTS AND ARTERIES
NT5E, CYS358TYR

In 3 Italian sisters, born of distantly related parents, who had
calcification of arteries and joints (211800), St. Hilaire et al. (2011)
identified homozygosity for a 1073G-A transition in exon 5 of the NT5E
gene, resulting in a cys358-to-tyr (C358Y) substitution at a conserved
residue. The unaffected parents were heterozygous for the mutation,
which was not found in 400 alleles from ethnically matched controls.
Transfection studies in HEK293 cells showed negligible CD73 activity
with the mutant compared to controls.

.0003
CALCIFICATION OF JOINTS AND ARTERIES
NT5E, 1-BP DUP, 1609A

In a 44-year-old woman with extensive calcification of distal arteries
and joints (211800), St. Hilaire et al. (2011) identified compound
heterozygosity for the S221X mutation (129190.0001) and a 1-bp
duplication (1609dupA) of the NT5E gene, predicted to result in a
premature termination codon. Neither mutation was present in 400 alleles
from ethnically matched controls. Transfection studies in HEK293 cells
showed negligible CD73 activity with the mutant compared to controls.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Wegener granulomatosis (608710) is a disease of unknown cause and
pathogenesis. Its major features are necrotizing granulomatous lesions,
which most often affect the upper and lower airways and are associated
with vasculitis, necrotizing glomerulonephritis, and pulmonary
capillaritis. It is a devastating illness; without immunosuppressive
therapy, over 80% of patients die within 1 year, often because of rapid
loss of renal function or massive pulmonary hemorrhage. Definitive
diagnosis hitherto depended on demonstration of characteristic
histologic findings. Beginning with the report of Davies et al. (1982),
detection of antineutrophil antibodies provided an immunologic
diagnosis. Niles et al. (1989) demonstrated that the circulating IgG
autoantibodies that produced a cytoplasmic pattern of staining in
neutrophils from 10 patients with Wegener granulomatosis reacted, in
Western blot analysis, with a 29-kD neutrophil protein (P29) that has
the characteristics of a distinctive serine proteinase. Ludemann et al.
(1990) showed further that the P29 antigen is identical to proteinase-3
(PR3). The neutral serine protease PR3 was isolated, identified, and
characterized from polymorphonuclear leukocytes by Kao et al. (1988).

Jenne et al. (1990) confirmed the identity of proteinase-3 and P29 and
showed that it is identical also to so-called AGP7, a novel neutrophil
serine protease of azurophil granules. Furthermore, they showed that
proteinase-3 is identical to myeloblastin, which has antiproliferative
properties. Gupta et al. (1990) corroborated the identity of the Wegener
autoantigen with cloned myeloblastin.

Zimmer et al. (1992) determined that proteinase-3 is one of the
antibiotic proteins of neutrophilic granules belonging to the serine
protease family. It is closely related to 2 others, neutrophil elastase
(ELA2; 130130) and azurocidin (AZU; 162815), and all 3 of these genes
are located in a cluster on chromosome 19. All 3 genes are expressed
coordinately and their protein products are packaged together into
azurophil granules during neutrophil differentiation.

Northern analysis by Sturrock et al. (1992) suggested that expression of
the PRTN3 gene is primarily confined to the promyelocytic/myelocytic
stage of bone marrow development.

GENE FUNCTION

Kao et al. (1988) showed that PR3 has an ability to induce emphysema in
hamsters commensurate with that of leukocyte elastase.

Ludemann et al. (1990) showed that PR3 is a neutral serine protease that
is able to cleave elastin.

Lutz et al. (2000) showed that myeloblastin is expressed specifically in
immature myeloid cells, that myeloblastin is a granulocyte
colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)-responsive gene, and that its
constitutive overexpression confers factor-independent growth to Ba/F3
cells expressing the G-CFS receptor. Lutz et al. (2000) suggested that
their results point to myeloblastin as a G-CSF-responsive gene critical
to factor-independent growth and indicate that the expression of the
G-CSF receptor is a prerequisite to this process. A 91-bp myeloblastin
promoter region containing binding sites for PU.1 (165170), C/EBP
(116897), and c-Myb (189990) is responsive to G-CSF treatment. Although
PU.1, C/EBP, and c-Myb transcription factors all were critical for
expression of myeloblastin, its upregulation by G-CSF was associated
mainly with PU.1. Lutz et al. (2000) concluded that myeloblastin is an
important target of PU.1 and a key protease for factor-independent
growth of hematopoietic cells.

Using RT-PCR, immunoblot, and immunofluorescence microscopy analyses,
Sugawara et al. (2001) demonstrated that oral epithelial cells express
IL18 (600953) mRNA and the 24-kD IL18 precursor protein. ELISA analysis
showed that stimulation of the cells with PRTN3 and lipopolysaccharide
(LPS) after gamma-interferon (IFNG; 147570) priming leads to
intracellular production and secretion of the 18-kD bioactive form of
IL18 in a caspase-1 (CASP1; 147678)-independent fashion. Cell
fractionation and immunoblot analyses indicated that PRTN3 acts on the
cell surface after the IFNG priming, not intracellularly. Sugawara et
al. (2001) proposed that PRTN3 together with LPS and IFNG may be
involved in mucosal inflammation, such as periodontitis.

Patients with inflammatory vascular disease caused by antineutrophil
cytoplasmic autoantibodies (ANCA) with specificity for proteinase-3
harbor not only antibodies to the autoantigen (PR3), but also antibodies
to a peptide translated from the antisense DNA strand of PR3
(complementary PR3, or cPR3) or to a mimic of this peptide. Pendergraft
et al. (2004) showed that immunization of mice with the middle region of
cPR3 resulted in production of antibodies not only to cPR3, but also to
the immunogen's sense peptide counterpart, PR3. Both human and mouse
antibodies to PR3 and cPR3 bound to each other, indicating idiotypic
relationships. Pendergraft et al. (2004) concluded that autoimmunity can
be initiated through an immune response against a peptide that is
antisense or complementary to the autoantigen, which then induces
antiidiotypic antibodies (autoantibodies) that crossreact with the
autoantigen.

Using IL32-alpha (606001) in agarose ligand affinity chromatography
analysis of concentrated urinary proteins, Novick et al. (2006) isolated
a 30-kD protein they identified as PR3. Surface plasmon resonance
analysis showed that urinary and neutrophil PR3 had similar binding
affinities for IL32-alpha, and IL32-alpha binding did not require PR3
enzymatic activity. However, limited PR3-mediated cleavage of IL32-alpha
resulted in stronger induction of Mip2 (CXCL2; 139110) in murine
macrophages and IL8 (146930) in human mononuclear cells. Novick et al.
(2006) proposed that inhibition of PR3 activity or IL32 neutralization
by inactive PR3 may reduce the consequences of IL32 activity in
immune-regulated diseases.

GENE STRUCTURE

Zimmer et al. (1992) determined that the PR3 gene has 5 exons. Sturrock
et al. (1992) showed that the PRTN3 gene spans about 6.5 kb and
comprises 5 exons and 4 introns.

MAPPING

Zimmer et al. (1992) mapped the PR3, ELA2, and AZU gene cluster to the
tip of the short arm of chromosome 19. By PCR amplification of the PRTN3
gene from a human/hamster hybrid cell line, Sturrock et al. (1992)
localized it to human chromosome 19. Sturrock et al. (1993) used
fluorescence in situ hybridization to localize the PRTN3 gene to
19p13.3.

By interspecific backcross analysis, Belaaouaj et al. (1997) mapped the
mouse Pr3 gene to chromosome 10.

603632	TITLE *603632 RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN S10; RPS10
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The mammalian ribosome is a macromolecular assembly of 4 RNA species
(see 180450) and approximately 80 different proteins (see 180466).

CLONING

Adams et al. (1992) isolated an RPS10 cDNA as a human brain EST.

By searching sequence databases with the partial sequences of randomly
selected cDNAs from a human colorectal cDNA library, Frigerio et al.
(1995) identified cDNAs encoding homologs of rat ribosomal proteins S5
(RPS5; 603630), S9 (RPS9; 603631), S10 (RPS10), S29 (RPS29; 603633), L5
(RPL5; 603634), L21 (RPL21; 603636), L27a (RPL27A; 603637), and L28
(RPL28; 603638). Frigerio et al. (1995) completed the cDNA sequences of
these human ribosomal proteins. The deduced 165-amino acid human RPS10
differs from rat Rps10 by 2 amino acids; neither protein contains
cysteine residues. Northern blot analysis suggested variable expression
of RPS10 in colorectal cancers compared to adjacent normal tissues,
although no correlation between the level of expression and the severity
of the disease was found.

GENE STRUCTURE

Boria et al. (2010) stated that the RPS10 gene contains 6 exons spanning
8.65 kb.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid and radiation hybrid mapping analyses, Kenmochi
et al. (1998) mapped the human RPS10 gene to chromosome 6p.

Boria et al. (2010) stated that the RPS10 gene maps to chromosome
6p21.31.

GENE FUNCTION

Using siRNA knockdown in HeLa cells to analyze the role of RPS10 in
pre-rRNA processing, Doherty et al. (2010) found that depletion of RPS10
led to decreased levels of 18S rRNA, indicating that RPS10 is necessary
for production of the small subunit. RNA blot analysis showed
accumulation of 43S, 26S, and 18S-E pre-rRNAs, consistent with defects
in cleavage at both ends of the 18S rRNA.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Doherty et al. (2010) sequenced 35 ribosomal protein genes in a cohort
of 117 patients with Diamond-Blackfan anemia (see DBA9, 613308) who were
negative for mutation in 7 known DBA genes and identified 3 mutations in
the RPS10 gene (603632.0001-603632.0003) in 5 patients.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
DIAMOND-BLACKFAN ANEMIA 9
RPS10, MET1ILE

In a male patient with Diamond-Blackfan anemia (613308), Doherty et al.
(2010) identified heterozygosity for a 3G-A transition in exon 1 of the
RPS10 gene, causing a met1-to-thr (M1T) substitution that eliminates the
start codon and is predicted to result in a truncated 144-residue
protein. The mutation was not found in at least 520 control chromosomes.

.0002
DIAMOND-BLACKFAN ANEMIA 9
RPS10, 1-BP INS, 260C

In a female patient who was diagnosed with Diamond-Blackfan anemia
(613308) at 2 months of age, Doherty et al. (2010) identified
heterozygosity for a 1-bp insertion (260insC) in exon 3 of the RPS10
gene, resulting in a frameshift and a premature termination codon. The
mutation was not found in her unaffected father or in at least 520
control chromosomes.

.0003
DIAMOND-BLACKFAN ANEMIA 9
RPS10, ARG113TER

In a male and 2 female probands with Diamond-Blackfan anemia (613308),
Doherty et al. (2010) identified heterozygosity for a 337C-T transition
in exon 4 of the RPS10 gene, resulting in an arg113-to-ter (R113X)
substitution. Two of the patients were responsive to steroid therapy;
the third, a female with a de novo mutation who was diagnosed at birth,
was unresponsive to steroid therapy and was also noted to have a webbed
neck. The mutation was not found in at least 520 control chromosomes.

600944	TITLE *600944 DEOXYHYPUSINE SYNTHASE; DHPS
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Joe et al. (1995) stated that the unusual amino acid hypusine is formed
posttranslationally and is only found in a single cellular protein,
eukaryotic translation initiation factor-5A (EIF5A; see 600187).
Hypusine biosynthesis involves 2 enzymatic steps. In the first step,
deoxyhypusine synthase (EC 2.5.1.46) catalyzes the NAD-dependent
transfer of the butylamine moiety of spermidine to the epsilon-amino
group of a specific lysine residue of the EIF5A precursor protein to
form the intermediate deoxyhypusine residue. In the second step,
mediated by deoxyhypusine hydroxylase (611262), the conversion of the
deoxyhypusine residue to the hypusine residue completes EIF5A
maturation. Hypusine is found in all eukaryotes and in some
archaebacteria, but not in eubacteria. The amino acid sequence of EIF5A
is highly conserved, especially in the region surrounding the hypusine
residue, suggesting an important fundamental function for this protein
throughout eukaryotic evolution. Hypusine and EIF5A appear to be vital
for cell proliferation in eukaryotes.

CLONING

Joe et al. (1995) isolated cDNA clones encoding deoxyhypusine synthase
from a human HeLa cell library. Full-length cDNA clones encoding a
369-amino acid protein (calculated molecular mass of 40,970 Da) and a
shorter cDNA clone (that would potentially encode a protein with an
internal deletion of 56 amino acids) were isolated. The deduced amino
acid sequence of the human enzyme showed a high degree of identity to
that of the yeast enzyme.

From a human peripheral blood mononuclear cell cDNA library, Bevec et
al. (1996) isolated 2 independent sequences encoding biologically active
deoxyhypusine synthase. DNA sequence analysis predicted a 369-amino acid
protein with a molecular mass of 41,055 Da.

GENE FUNCTION

Bevec et al. (1996) demonstrated that recombinant DHPS showed
significant catalytic activity in synthesis of deoxyhypusine after in
vitro transcription and translation as well as on expression in
Escherichia coli.

Hauber et al. (2005) demonstrated that inhibition of DHPS by the
experimental drug CNI-1493 or RNA interference efficiently suppressed
retroviral replication in cell culture and primary cells with no
measurable drug-induced adverse effects on cell cycle transition,
apoptosis, or general cytotoxicity. They showed that the antiviral
effect of CNI-1493 was due to inhibition of the HIV-1 Rev regulatory
protein, for which the hypusine-requiring EIF5A is a cofactor.

MAPPING

Using a panel of somatic rodent/human cell hybrids, Bevec et al. (1996)
localized the DHPS gene to human chromosome 19. Jones et al. (1996)
localized the DHPS gene to 19p13.12-p13.11, using fluorescence in situ
hybridization analysis in a combination with somatic human/rodent
translocation hybrid analysis.
