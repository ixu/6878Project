DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CD44 is an integral cell membrane glycoprotein with a postulated role in
matrix adhesion lymphocyte activation and lymph node homing (Aruffo et
al., 1990).

CLONING

Telen et al. (1983) used a murine monoclonal antibody (A3D8) to identify
an erythrocyte antigen inhibited by the In(Lu) gene. Telen et al. (1984)
showed that the A3D8 antigenic property resides on an 80-kD red cell
membrane protein which is present in only trace amounts in In(Lu)
Lu(a-b-) red cells (INLU; 111150). Haynes (1986) had evidence that the
A1G3 and A3D8 monoclonal antibodies bind to different epitopes on the
same 80-kD molecule. The monoclonal antibody A3D8 recognized an antigen
officially called MDU3, for 'monoclonal Duke University, 3,' or CD44.
Telen (1992) knew of no evidence that the INLU and CD44 (MDU3) genes are
the same.

By screening cDNA libraries prepared from hemopoietic cell lines,
Stamenkovic et al. (1989) isolated CD44 clones. Immunoprecipitation of
CD44 from transfected COS cells and cultured cell lines detected
cell-specific expression of an 80- to 90-kD protein and a 160-kD
protein. Several minor forms of 52 to 200 kD were variably present in
different cell types. RNA blot analysis revealed transcripts of 1.6,
2.2, and 5.0 kb in hemopoietic cell lines. RNA blot analysis of
carcinoma cell lines revealed 3 patterns of expression: the first,
exemplified by melanoma cell lines, was identical to the hemopoietic
cell pattern associated with the 80- to 90-kD isoform; the second,
exemplified by a colon carcinoma cell line, showed transcripts of 2.0,
2.6, and 5.6 kb associated with the 160-kD isoform; and the third,
exemplified by another colon carcinoma cell line, was a composite of the
first 2 patterns. All primary carcinoma specimens examined showed
prevalent CD44 transcripts of either hemopoietic or composite type. The
CD44 cDNA encodes a 361-amino acid protein with a 20-residue secretory
signal peptide, a 248-residue extracellular N-terminal domain with
multiple N- and O-linked glycosylation sites, a 21-amino acid
transmembrane domain, and a 72-residue hydrophilic cytoplasmic domain.
The mature protein has a calculated molecular mass of 37 kD. Sequence
analysis suggested homology with chicken and rat cartilage link proteins
(HAPLN1; 115435).

Stefanova et al. (1989) demonstrated that the lymphocyte homing receptor
is identical to the human leukocyte surface glycoprotein called CDw44,
on the basis of studies at the Third International Workshop on Human
Leukocyte Differentiation Antigens. It also appears to be identical to
the Pgp-1 glycoprotein of Omary et al. (1988).

GENE FAMILY

A table of all the CD antigens was provided by Schlossman et al. (1994)
with a list of the common names, the size in kilodaltons, and the nature
of the protein (adhesion, myeloid, platelet, and B cell, T cell, etc.).

GENE STRUCTURE

Screaton et al. (1992) found that the CD44 gene contains 19 exons
spanning 50 kb of genomic DNA. They identified 10 alternatively spliced
exons within the extracellular domain, including 1 exon that had not
previously been reported. In addition to the inclusion or exclusion of
whole exons, additional diversity was generated through the utilization
of internal splice donor and acceptor sites within 2 of the exons. A
variation in the cytoplasmic domain was shown to result from the
alternative splicing of 2 exons. Thus the genomic structure of CD44 is
remarkably complex, and alternative splicing is the basis of its
structural and functional diversity.

Nedvetzki et al. (2003) noted that human CD44 isoforms are generated
from 9 variant exons (v2 to v10) inserted in different combinations
between 2 constant regions consisting of 5 exons at the N terminus and 4
exons at the C terminus (constant exon 19 is noncoding). Direct splicing
of constant exon 5 to constant exon 16, thereby skipping the variant
exons, generates the standard CD44 isoform.

GENE FUNCTION

Aruffo et al. (1990) demonstrated that CD44 is the main cell surface
receptor for hyaluronate. Mature lymphocytes in the circulation migrate
selectively from the bloodstream to different lymphatic tissues through
specialized high endothelial venules (HEV). Molecules on the surface of
lymphocytes called homing receptors interact specifically with HEV and
play a central role in the migration.

Splice variants of the glycoprotein CD44 may be associated with
metastases and therefore may be useful in the early detection of
metastatic potential in surgical biopsy specimens, as well as in the
early diagnosis of cancer in screening programs, assessment of remaining
disease, and early detection of recurrence (Matsumura and Tarin, 1992).
Mayer et al. (1993) found that expression of CD44, which is not found in
normal gastric mucosa and is found in only 49% of primary tumors, was
associated with distant metastases at time of diagnosis and with tumor
recurrence and increased mortality from gastric cancer.

Weber et al. (1996) noted that the CD44 gene encodes a transmembrane
protein that is expressed as a family of molecular isoforms generated
from alternative RNA splicing and posttranslational modifications.
Certain CD44 isoforms that regulate activation and migration of
lymphocytes and macrophages may also enhance local growth and metastatic
spread of tumor cells. One ligand of CD44 is hyaluronic acid, binding of
which to the NH2-terminal domain of CD44 enhances cellular aggregation
and tumor cell growth. (Krainer et al. (1991) referred to CD44 as a
'hyaladherin' -- see 601269.) Weber et al. (1996) demonstrated that
another ligand is osteopontin (166490). Osteopontin induces cellular
chemotaxis but not homotypic aggregation of cells, whereas the inverse
is true for the interaction between CD44 and hyaluronate. The
alternative responses to CD44 ligation may be exploited by tumor cells
to allow OPN-mediated metastatic spread and hyaluronate-dependent growth
in newly colonized tissues in the process of tumor metastasis.

Sherman et al. (1998) investigated the role of CD44 proteins in early
limb development. Members of this family of transmembrane glycoproteins
are expressed by cells of the limb bud, including those of the apical
ectodermal ridge (AER). Distinct CD44 variants are generated from a
single gene by alternative RNA splicing of up to 10 variant exons and by
extensive posttranslational modifications. The amino acid sequences
encoded by these variant exons are located in the extracellular portion
of the protein near the transmembrane domain. A standard form of CD44
lacking these variant sequences is expressed by numerous cell types and
is the smallest CD44 protein. It carries no variant exon sequences.
Splice variants are expressed in only a limited number of tissues and in
certain tumors. Signals from the AER of the developing vertebrate limb,
including fibroblast growth factor-8 (600483), can maintain limb
mesenchymal cells in proliferative state. Sherman et al. (1998) reported
that a specific CD44 splice variant is crucial for the proliferation of
these mesenchymal cells. Epitopes carried by this variant colocalize
temporally and spatially with FGF8 in the AER throughout early limb
development. A splice variant containing the same sequence expressed on
model cells binds both FGF4 (164980) and FGF8 and stimulates mesenchymal
cells in vitro. Sherman et al. (1998) found that when applied to the
AER, an antibody against a specific CD44 epitope blocked FGF
presentation and inhibited limb outgrowth. Therefore, CD44 is necessary
for limb development and functions in a novel growth factor presentation
mechanism likely relevant to other physiologic and pathologic situations
in which a cell surface protein presents a signaling molecule to a
neighboring cell.

Cywes and Wessels (2001) demonstrated that CD44-dependent group A
Streptococcus binding to polarized monolayers of human keratinocytes
induced marked cytoskeletal rearrangements manifested by membrane
ruffling and disruption of intercellular junctions. Transduction of the
signal induced by group A Streptococcus binding to CD44 on the
keratinocyte surface involved Rac1 (602048) and the cytoskeleton linker
protein ezrin (123900), as well as tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular
proteins. Studies of bacterial translocation in 2 models of human skin
indicated that cell signaling triggered by interaction of the group A
Streptococcus capsule with CD44 opened intercellular junctions and
promoted tissue penetration by group A Streptococcus through a
paracellular route. Cywes and Wessels (2001) concluded that their
results support a model of host cytoskeleton manipulation and tissue
invasion by an extracellular bacterial pathogen.

Nedvetzki et al. (2003) identified a CD44 variant, designated CD44vRA,
in synovial fluid aspirated from 23 of 30 patients with rheumatoid
arthritis (RA; 180300). Sequence analysis showed that the CD44vRA
isoform contains an intron-derived CAG trinucleotide inclusion 5-prime
to constant exon 5 within the CD44v3-v10 isoform. Functional expression
studies in human cells showed that the CD44vRA variant interacted with
FGF2 (134920) via the heparan sulfate on exon v3 in a way that enhanced
binding and activation of soluble FGFR1 (136350) to a greater extent
than CD44v3-v10. Synovial fluid cells from RA patients bound soluble
FGFR1 more intensively than control cells. Nedvetzki et al. (2003)
postulated that activation of FGFR1 may play a role in the RA
inflammatory process.

In a mouse hindlimb model of arteriogenesis, van Royen et al. (2004)
found that Cd44 expression increased strongly during collateral vessel
growth in wildtype mice and that arteriogenesis was severely impaired in
Cd44 -/- mice. The defective arteriogenesis was accompanied by reduced
leukocyte trafficking to sites of collateral artery growth and reduced
expression of FGF2 and platelet-derived growth factor-B protein (PDGFB;
190040). In 14 consecutive patients with single-vessel coronary artery
disease, van Royen et al. (2004) found that the maximal expression of
CD44 on activated monocytes was reduced in patients with poor
collateralization compared to patients with good collateralization. Van
Royen et al. (2004) concluded that CD44 plays a pivotal role in
arteriogenesis.

By analyzing a human breast cancer cell line transduced with a micro RNA
(miRNA) expression library, Huang et al. (2008) found that human miR373
(611954) and miR520C stimulated cell migration and invasion in vitro and
in vivo. Using expression array analysis, they found that the migration
phenotype of miR373- and miR520C-expressing cells depended on
suppression of CD44. Upregulation of miR373 correlated inversely with
CD44 expression in breast cancer metastasis samples. The authors noted
that increased expression of the most common CD44 isoform correlates
with overall survival of breast cancer patients.

Godar et al. (2008) found that p53 (TP53; 191170) negatively regulated
CD44 expression in normal human mammary epithelial cells by binding to a
noncanonical p53-binding sequence in the CD44 promoter. Inhibition of
CD44 enabled the cells to respond to stress-induced, p53-dependent
cytostatic and apoptotic signals that would have otherwise been blocked
by CD44. In the absence of p53, CD44 promoted growth in a highly
tumorigenic mammary epithelial cell line. In both normal and tumorigenic
cell lines, p63 (TP63; 603273) positively regulated CD44 expression.

MAPPING

Francke et al. (1983) showed that the antigens defined by monoclonal
antibodies A3D8 and A1G3 are determined by genes on 11p.

The mouse monoclonal antibody Hermes-3 recognizes the 85- to 95-kD human
lymphocyte homing receptor. Using mouse-human T-lymphocyte hybrids and
hybrids of Chinese hamster ovary cells with human amniotic fibroblasts,
Ala-Kapee et al. (1989) found that Hermes-3 expression, as demonstrated
by indirect immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation, was determined
by 11pter-p13. Forsberg et al. (1989) refined the assignment of the
lymphocyte homing receptor gene to 11pter-p13 by study of Chinese
hamster-human cell hybrids in which the human parent cells had various
deletions of human chromosome 11. Although CD44 may have function as a
lymphocyte homing receptor, the gene that maps to chromosome 11 is
distinct from the lymph node homing receptor located on chromosome 1
(153240) (Seldin, 1990). In the mouse, the corresponding gene has been
referred to as Ly-24.

Cianfriglia et al. (1992) mapped a drug-sensitivity marker, MC56, to
11pter-p13. Identity of the protein to the CD44 antigen, suggested on
other grounds, was supported by the map location.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

The Indian blood group (609027) comprises 2 antigens, In(a) and In(b),
which reside on CD44. By RT-PCR analysis of cDNA extracted from
In(a+b-)-transformed B lymphocytes, Telen et al. (1996) identified the
CD44 polymorphism that causes the In(b-) phenotype. The polymorphism
results in an arg46-to-pro change (R46P; 107269.0001), removing the
basically charged amino acid at the C terminus of the hyaluronan
(HA)-binding motif of CD44. In previous studies using chimeric proteins,
arg46 was shown to be crucial for HA binding by CD44 (Yang et al.,
1994). However, Telen et al. (1996) demonstrated that the R46P change
does not reduce HA binding to CD44.

ANIMAL MODEL

Schmits et al. (1997) generated mice deficient in all known isoforms of
Cd44 by targeting exons encoding the invariant N-terminal region of the
molecule. Mice were born in mendelian ratio without any obvious
developmental or neurologic deficits. Hematologic impairment was
evidenced by altered tissue distribution of myeloid progenitors with
increased levels of colony-forming unit-granulocyte-macrophage in bone
marrow and reduced numbers in spleen. Fetal liver colony-forming
unit-spleen and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor mobilization
assays, together with reduced colony-forming unit-granulocyte-macrophage
in peripheral blood, suggested that progenitor egress from the bone
marrow was defective. Mice also developed exaggerated granuloma
responses to Cryotosporidium parvum infection. Tumor studies showed that
SV40-transformed Cd44-deficient fibroblasts were highly tumorigenic in
nude mice, whereas reintroduction of Cd44 expression into these
fibroblasts resulted in a dramatic inhibition of tumor growth.

Teder et al. (2002) studied the role of Cd44 in lung inflammation by
using the Cd44-deficient mice generated by Schmits et al. (1997). After
intratracheal administration of bleomycin, 75% of Cd44-deficient mice
died by day 14. They developed unremitting inflammation, characterized
by impaired clearance of apoptotic neutrophils, persistent accumulation
of hyaluronan fragments at the site of the tissue injury, and impaired
activation of transforming growth factor beta-1 (190180). This phenotype
was partially reversed by reconstitution with Cd44+ cells, thus
demonstrating a critical role for this receptor in resolving lung
inflammation.

Using immunohistochemistry, Leemans et al. (2003) confirmed that
Cd44-high cells accumulated in mouse lungs following intranasal
infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Cd44 -/- mice, however, had a
50% reduction in pulmonary macrophages 2 weeks after infection, although
the absolute numbers of leukocytes were unchanged. By 5 weeks after
infection, a significant reduction in Cd4 (186940)-positive lymphocyte
numbers was observed in mutant mice. At both time points, the
Cd44-deficient mice displayed disorganized granulomas containing
predominantly polymorphonuclear neutrophils rather than well-demarcated
granulomas consisting of lymphocytes and macrophages. Splenocytes were
more numerous in mice lacking Cd44, and they secreted significantly more
Ifng (147570) in response to antigen-specific stimulation than
splenocytes of wildtype mice. Flow cytometric analysis showed that human
CD44 bound to M. tuberculosis, and Cd44 -/- mouse macrophages contained
fewer bacteria than wildtype macrophages. The mutant mice allowed
greater replication of M. tuberculosis in lung and liver and had reduced
survival compared with wildtype mice. Leemans et al. (2003) proposed
that CD44 mediates resistance to mycobacterial infection by promoting
binding and phagocytosis by macrophages and by recruiting these cells to
the site of infection.

TNF (191160) is a major inducer of chronic inflammation, and its
overexpression leads to chronic inflammatory arthritis. Hayer et al.
(2005) crossed Cd44 -/- mice with mice transgenic for human TNF and
found that destruction of joints and progressive crippling was far more
severe in Cd44 -/- transgenic mice than in transgenic mice expressing
Cd44. Cd44 -/- transgenic mice exhibited increased systemic bone
resorption due to an increase in the number, size, and activity of
osteoclasts. Bone formation and osteoblast differentiation were not
affected. Cd44 -/- osteoclasts had an enhanced response to TNF that was
associated with increased activation of p38 (MAPK14; 600289). Hayer et
al. (2005) concluded that CD44 is a critical inhibitor of TNF-induced
joint destruction and inflammatory bone loss.

Krause et al. (2006) found that mice lacking Cd44 were as susceptible as
wildtype mice to murine chronic myeloid leukemia (CML; 608232) after
challenge with BCR-ABL virus. However, bone marrow cells from Cd44 -/-
mice transduced with the virus showed defective homing to recipient bone
marrow, resulting in decreased engraftment and reduced CML-like disease.
In contrast, Cd44 was dispensable for induction of B-lymphoblastic
leukemia-like disease. Krause et al. (2006) concluded that CD44 is
required for leukemic stem cells that initiate CML.

Jin et al. (2006) found that treatment with activating monoclonal
antibodies to CD44 markedly reduced leukemic repopulation in nonobese
diabetic (NOD)/severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice challenged
with human acute myeloid leukemia (AML; 601626) cells. Absence of
leukemia following serial tumor transplantation experiments in mice
demonstrated direct targeting of AML leukemic stem cells (LSCs).
Treatment of engrafted mice with anti-CD44 reduced the number of Cd34
(142230)-positive/Cd38 (107270)-negative primitive stem cells and
increased the number of Cd14 (158120)-positive monocytic cells.
Anti-CD44 treatment also diminished the homing capacity of SCID
leukemia-initiating cells to bone marrow and spleen. Jin et al. (2006)
concluded that CD44 is a key regulator of AML LSCs, which require a
niche to maintain their stem cell properties. They suggested that CD44
targeting may help eliminate quiescent AML LSCs.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
INDIAN BLOOD GROUP SYSTEM POLYMORPHISM
CD44, ARG46PRO

The Indian blood group (609027) comprises 2 antigens, In(a) and In(b),
which reside on CD44. By RT-PCR analysis of cDNA extracted from
In(a+b-)-transformed B lymphocytes, Telen et al. (1996) identified the
CD44 polymorphism that causes the In(b-) phenotype. The G-to-C change at
nucleotide 252 results in an arg46-to-pro change (R46P), removing the
basically charged amino acid at the C terminus of the hyaluronan
(HA)-binding motif of CD44. In previous studies using chimeric proteins,
arg46 was shown to be crucial for HA binding by CD44 (Yang et al.,
1994). However, Telen et al. (1996) demonstrated that the R46P change
does not reduce HA binding to CD44.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The ST3GAL3 gene encodes
beta-galactoside-alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase-III, a Golgi resident
membrane protein that forms the sialyl Lewis a (sLe-a) epitope on
glyocoproteins. These glycoproteins form the glycocalyx, composed of
sialic acids that act as key determinants of a variety of cellular
recognition and communication processes (summary by Hu et al., 2011).

CLONING

By screening a human placenta cDNA library with a probe based on the
sialyl motif (a highly conserved region in the catalytic domain of
sialyltransferases), Kitagawa and Paulson (1993) isolated a cDNA
encoding SIAT6, which they termed ST3N (EC 2.4.99.6). The deduced
375-amino acid protein is 97% identical to the rat protein. SDS-PAGE
analysis showed expression of an 80-kD protein having sialyltransferase
activity. Northern blot analysis revealed wide expression of a 2.7-kb
transcript with abundant expression in skeletal muscle and high
expression in fetal tissue but low expression in placenta.

Using Northern blot analysis, Kitagawa and Paulson (1994) evaluated the
differential expression of 5 human sialyltransferase genes in adult and
fetal tissues. A 2.7-kb ST3N transcript was expressed highly in skeletal
muscle and moderately in most other tissues examined. A 3.8-kb
transcript was also expressed in testis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Taniguchi et al. (2003) determined that the 5-prime UTR of the ST3GAL3
gene consists of 2 exons. The 5-prime flanking region of the promoter
lacks canonical TATA or CCAAT boxes, but it contains several putative
transcriptional factor binding sites.

Hu et al. (2011) stated that the ST3GAL3 gene contains 15 exons, 12 of
which are coding exons.

MAPPING

The International RH Mapping Consortium mapped the SIAT6 gene to
chromosome 1 (TMAP stSG22084).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Autosomal Recessive Mental Retardation 12

In affected members of 2 unrelated consanguineous Iranian families with
autosomal recessive nonsyndromic mental retardation-12 (MRT12; 611090),
Hu et al. (2011) used linkage analysis, chromosome sorting, and
next-generation sequencing to identify 2 different homozygous mutations
in the ST3GAL3 gene (A13D, 606494.0001 and D370Y, 606494.0002,
respectively.) Neither mutation affected the highly conserved sialyl
motifs, but rather affected the N-terminal transmembrane domain and
catalytic domain, respectively. In vitro functional expression studies
showed that the mutant proteins were mislocalized to the endoplasmic
reticulum and that one (D370Y) had loss of catalytic activity. The
findings demonstrated a link between the glycoprotein complex,
sialyltransferase activity, and higher cognitive functioning.

- Early Infantile Epileptic Encephalopathy 15

In 4 members of a consanguineous Palestinian family with early infantile
epileptic encephalopathy-15 (EIEE15; 615006), Edvardson et al. (2013)
identified a homozygous mutation in the ST3GAL3 gene (A320P;
606494.0003). The mutation was identified by linkage analysis combined
with whole-exome sequencing of 1 individual and confirmed by Sanger
sequencing. The mutation affected the highly conserved sialyl motif S,
which is crucially involved in binding of both donor and acceptor
substrate. In vitro functional expression studies showed that secretion
of the mutant protein was reduced to 25% of control levels and it had no
detectable enzymatic activity. The phenotype was severe: patients showed
delayed psychomotor development and had onset of refractory infantile
spasms between ages 3 and 7 months associated with hypsarrhythmia on
EEG. Other features included hypotonia, poor eye contact, and inability
to speak or walk, even later in childhood. All were profoundly mentally
retarded. Edvardson et al. (2013) noted that the phenotype was more
severe than that observed by Hu et al. (2011), who had identified
ST3GAL3 mutations outside of the highly conserved and functionally
important sialyl motifs.

MENTAL RETARDATION, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE 12
ST3GAL3, ALA13ASP

In affected members of a consanguineous Iranian family with autosomal
recessive mental retardation-12 (MRT12; 611090), previously reported by
Najmabadi et al. (2007), Hu et al. (2011) identified a homozygous 38C-A
transversion in exon 2 of the ST3GAL3 gene, resulting in an ala13-to-asp
(A13D) substitution in the transmembrane domain. The mutation was not
found in 278 copies of chromosome 1 from ethnically matched controls or
in 385 control individuals. In vitro functional expression studies in
murine fibroblasts showed that most of the mutant protein was improperly
localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, preventing the protein from
interacting with its substrates in the Golgi, resulting in a loss of
function. Catalytic activity of the A13D mutant enzyme was similar to
wildtype.

MENTAL RETARDATION, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE 12
ST3GAL3, ASP370TYR

In affected members of a consanguineous Iranian family with autosomal
recessive mental retardation-12 (MRT12; 611090), Hu et al. (2011)
identified a homozygous 1108G-T transversion in exon 14 of the ST3GAL3
gene, resulting in an asp370-to-tyr (D370Y) substitution in the
catalytic domain at the C-terminal end of the protein. The mutation was
not found in 278 copies of chromosome 1 from ethnically matched controls
or in 385 control individuals. In vitro functional expression studies in
murine fibroblasts showed that the mutant protein was improperly
localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, preventing the protein from
interacting with its substrates in the Golgi, resulting in a loss of
function. The D370Y mutant protein also showed a complete lack of enzyme
activity. Studies of recombinant proteins in CHO cells indicated that
secretion of the D370Y mutant protein was dramatically reduced compared
to wildtype. Hu et al. (2011) concluded that the mutant protein was
cleared by the endoplasmic reticulum-mediated system, suggesting that
the C terminus is important for the proper folding of functional
ST3GAL3.

EPILEPTIC ENCEPHALOPATHY, EARLY INFANTILE, 15
ST3GAL3, ALA320PRO

In 4 members of a consanguineous Palestinian family with early infantile
epileptic encephalopathy-15 (EIEE15; 615006), Edvardson et al. (2013)
identified a homozygous 958G-C transversion in exon 12 of the ST3GAL3
gene, resulting in an ala320-to-pro (A320P) substitution at a highly
conserved residue in the sialyl motif S. The mutation was identified by
linkage analysis combined with whole-exome sequencing of 1 individual
and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. It segregated with the disorder in
the family and was not found in 123 controls of the same ethnic origin
or in 5,379 control exomes. In vitro functional expression studies
showed that secretion of the mutant protein was reduced to 25% of
control levels and that the protein had no detectable enzymatic
activity.

600426	TITLE *600426 E2F TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR 2; E2F2
DESCRIPTION See E2F1 (189971).

CLONING

Ivey-Hoyle et al. (1993) cloned a cDNA from a HeLa cell library using a
probe containing the DNA-binding domain of E2F1. The cDNA, designated
E2F2, has overall amino acid sequence similarity to E2F1 of 46%. The
same cDNA and corresponding genomic region was cloned by Lees et al.
(1993). Lees et al. (1993) also showed that expressed E2F2 bound to both
the E2F DNA recognition sites and to the RB1 protein (614041).

GENE FUNCTION

MYC (190080) induces transcription of the E2F1, E2F2, and E2F3 (600427)
genes. Using primary mouse embryo fibroblasts deleted for individual E2f
genes, Leone et al. (2001) showed that MYC-induced S phase and apoptosis
requires distinct E2F activities. The ability of Myc to induce S phase
was impaired in the absence of either E2f2 or E2f3 but not E2f1 or E2f4
(600659). In contrast, the ability of Myc to induce apoptosis was
markedly reduced in cells deleted for E2f1 but not E2f2 or E2f3. The
authors proposed that the induction of specific E2F activities is an
essential component in the MYC pathways that control cell proliferation
and cell fate decisions.

The retinoblastoma tumor suppressor (Rb) pathway is believed to have a
critical role in the control of cellular proliferation by regulating E2F
activities. E2F1, E2F2, and E2F3 belong to a subclass of E2F factors
thought to act as transcriptional activators important for progression
through the G1/S transition. Wu et al. (2001) used a conditional gene
targeting approach to demonstrate that combined loss of these 3 E2F
factors severely affects E2F target expression and completely abolishes
the ability of mouse embryonic fibroblasts to enter S phase, progress
through mitosis, and proliferate. Loss of E2F function results in
elevation of CIP1 (116899) protein, leading to a decrease in
cyclin-dependent kinase activity and Rb phosphorylation. Wu et al.
(2001) concluded that these findings suggested a function for this
subclass of E2F transcriptional activators in a positive feedback loop,
through downmodulation of CIP1, that leads to the inactivation of
Rb-dependent repression and S phase entry. By targeting the entire
subclass of E2F transcriptional activators, Wu et al. (2001) provided
direct genetic evidence for their essential role in cell cycle
progression, proliferation, and development. Wu et al. (2001) initially
generated and interbred E2f1, E2f2, and E2f3 mutant mice, and found that
although mice null for E2f1 and E2f2 were viable and developed to
adulthood, mice null for E2f1 and E2f3 or E2f2 and E2f3 died early
during embryonic development, at or just before embryonic day 9.5,
pointing to a central role for E2F3 in mouse development.

Funke-Kaiser et al. (2003) identified 5 polymorphisms in the ECE1 gene
(600423), a candidate for human blood pressure regulation, among a
cohort of 704 European hypertensive patients. Electrophoretic mobility
shift assays revealed the specific binding of E2F2 to ECE1b promoter
sequences containing either allele of the C-338A polymorphism
(600423.0002), with the -338A allele being associated with an increased
affinity to E2F2 compared with -338C. The authors proposed a link
between the cell cycle-associated E2F family and blood pressure
regulation via a component of the endothelin system.

To address the function of E2F1, E2F2, and E2F3 in normal mammalian
cells in vivo, Chen et al. (2009) focused on the mouse retina, which is
a relatively simple central nervous system component that can be
manipulated genetically without compromising viability and has provided
considerable insight into development and cancer. The authors showed
that unlike fibroblasts, E2f1-, E2f2-, and E2f3-null retinal progenitor
cells or activated Muller glia can divide. Chen et al. (2009) attributed
this effect to functional interchangeability with Mycn (164840).
However, loss of activating E2fs caused downregulation of the p53
(191170) deacetylase Sirt1 (604479), p53 hyperacetylation, and elevated
apoptosis, establishing a novel E2f-Sirt1-p53 survival axis in vivo.
Chen et al. (2009) concluded that activating E2fs are not universally
required for normal mammalian cell division, but have an unexpected
prosurvival role in development.

Using a panel of tissue-specific cre-transgenic mice and conditional E2f
alleles, Chong et al. (2009) examined the effects of E2f1, E2f2, and
E2f3 triple deficiency in murine embryonic stem cells, embryos, and
small intestines. They showed that in normal dividing progenitor cells,
E2f1-3 function as transcriptional activators, but are dispensable for
cell division and instead are necessary for cell survival. In
differentiating cells E2f1-3 function in a complex with Rb (614041) as
repressors to silence E2f targets and facilitate exit from the cell
cycle. The inactivation of Rb in differentiating cells resulted in a
switch of E2f1-3 from repressors to activators, leading to the
superactivation of E2f-responsive targets and ectopic cell divisions.
Loss of E2f1-3 completely suppressed these phenotypes caused by Rb
deficiency. Chong et al. (2009) concluded that their work contextualizes
the activator versus repressor functions of E2f1-3 in vivo, revealing
distinct roles in dividing versus differentiating cells and in normal
versus cancer-like cell cycles.

MAPPING

Lees et al. (1993) mapped the E2F2 gene to 1p36 by fluorescence in situ
hybridization.

ANIMAL MODEL

Iglesias et al. (2004) generated mice deficient in both E2f1 (189971)
and E2f2. The mice developed nonautoimmune insulin-deficient diabetes
and exocrine pancreatic dysfunction characterized by endocrine and
exocrine cell dysplasia and a reduction in the number and size of acini
and islets, which were replaced by ductal structures and adipose tissue.
Mutant pancreatic cells exhibited increased rates of DNA replication but
also of apoptosis, resulting in severe pancreatic atrophy. The
expression of genes involved in DNA replication and cell cycle control
was upregulated in the E2f1/E2f2 compound mutant pancreas. Iglesias et
al. (2004) suggested that E2F1/E2F2 activity negatively controls growth
of mature pancreatic cells and is necessary for the maintenance of
differentiated pancreatic phenotypes in the adult.

608527	TITLE *608527 NEURAMINIDASE 4; NEU4
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Neuraminidases, or sialidases (EC 3.2.1.18), such as NEU4, constitute a
large family of glycohydrolytic enzymes that cleave terminal sialic acid
residues from various sialo derivatives, such as sialo-oligosaccharides,
sialoglycoproteins, and gangliosides.

CLONING

Comelli et al. (2003) cloned mouse Neu4 from a brain cDNA library. The
deduced 501-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of about
55 kD.

Monti et al. (2004) cloned human NEU4 by searching a database for
sequences similar to NEU2 (605528), followed by screening a PAC library
and RT-PCR of total RNA extracted from COS-7 cells transfected with a
NEU4 PAC clone. The NEU4 sequence has a high GC content (70%). The
deduced 484-amino acid NEU4 protein has a calculated molecular mass of
51.6 kD. It contains 2 putative transmembrane regions, an N-terminal
sialidase motif, 2 classical asp blocks, and a stretch of 79 amino acids
that appear unique among sialidases. NEU4 also has 3 potential
O-glycosylation sites and several potential phosphorylation sites. The
authors predicted that the N and C termini of NEU4 are extracellular.
NEU4 shares significant similarity with a 478-amino acid variant of
mouse Neu4, with complete conservation of residues likely to be within
the active site. RNA dot blot analysis detected at least minimal
expression of NEU4 in all 50 adult and fetal tissues examined. Highest
expression was in liver, and much lower expression was detected in
colon, small intestine, kidney, whole brain, and all central nervous
system areas examined. Immunofluorescence and confocal analysis of
transfected COS-7 cells showed extensive intracellular
membrane-associated labeling for NEU4. The labeled membranous network
was spread throughout the cytoplasm, and labeling did not colocalize
with a lysosome marker.

By Northern blot analysis, Seyrantepe et al. (2004) found variable
expression of a 5.6-kb NEU4 transcript in all human tissues examined,
with highest expression in skeletal muscle, heart, liver, and placenta.
Epitope-tagged NEU4 expressed in COS-7 cells colocalized with lysosomal
markers and fractionated with the supernatant following sonication,
suggesting that NEU4 is a soluble lysosomal hydrolase. Glycosylated
human NEU4 had an apparent molecular mass of 60 kD by SDS-PAGE.

Bigi et al. (2010) stated that there are long and short isoforms of
human NEU4 that differ in the presence or absence of a 12-amino acid
N-terminal sequence. In contrast with the findings of Seyrantepe et al.
(2004), Bigi et al. (2010) found that both isoforms were extrinsic
membrane proteins. The long NEU4 isoform localized to the outer
mitochondrial membrane, whereas the short isoform localized to several
intracellular membranes, including the endoplasmic reticulum.

GENE FUNCTION

Comelli et al. (2003) showed that mouse Neu4 had sialidase activity at
pH 5.5 against the synthetic substrate
2-prime-(4-methylumbelliferyl)-alpha-D-N-acetylneuraminic acid
(4MU-NeuAc).

Monti et al. (2004) confirmed that human NEU4 has sialidase activity
using 4MU-NeuAc as substrate; the pH optimum was 3.2. NEU4 did not
remove sialic acid residues from alpha-2,3-sialyllactose, gangliosides
GD1a and GM3, or any human and bovine glycoproteins used as substrate.
Nearly 80% of the activity was recovered in a high-speed pellet of
transfected COS-7 cells.

Seyrantepe et al. (2004) found that human NEU4 expressed in COS-7 cells
showed broad substrate specificity, being almost equally active on
glycoproteins, oligosaccharides, sialylated glycolipids, and 4MU-NeuAc.
With 4MU-NeuAc, NEU4 showed a pH optimum of 3.5. NEU4 was secreted from
transfected mucolipidosis II (252500) fibroblasts rather than being
targeted to lysosomes, suggesting that correct localization of NEU4 in
lysosomes is dependent on mannose 6-phosphate receptor (see 154540).
Expression of either NEU4 or NEU1 in sialidosis (256550) or
galactosialidosis (256540) fibroblasts reduced the lysosomal storage
phenotype, suggesting that NEU4 is active on undigested substrates
containing neuraminic acid.

The addition of polysialic acid, a homopolymer of alpha-2,8-linked
sialic acid, is an important modification of neural cell adhesion
molecule (NCAM, or NCAM1; 116930) and is implicated in neurite
extension. Takahashi et al. (2012) found that the short isoform of mouse
Neu4, which they called Neu4b, degraded polysialic acid on NCAM, whereas
other neuraminidases, including the long isoform of Neu4, did not. Neu4b
had activity with polysialic acid at acidic and near neutral pH.
Overexpression of Neu4b in mouse embryonic hippocampal neurons inhibited
neurite outgrowth in culture. Conversely, knockdown of Neu4 via small
interfering RNA enhanced neurite outgrowth. Neu4b mainly localized to
neuronal soma, predominantly at the ER, but it also partially
colocalized with polysialic acid at growth cones. Takahashi et al.
(2012) concluded that Neu4b is involved in regulation of neurite
outgrowth by degrading the polysialic acid modification of NCAM.

GENE STRUCTURE

Monti et al. (2004) determined that the human NEU4 gene contains 4 exons
and spans about 6.7 kb. Exon 1 is untranslated. Comelli et al. (2003)
found that the mouse Neu4 gene contains 4 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Monti et al. (2004) mapped the NEU4 gene
to chromosome 2q37.3, where it is flanked on the telomeric side by the
GP3ST gene (608237) and on the centromeric side by the DTYMK gene
(188345). Comelli et al. (2003) mapped the mouse Neu4 gene to chromosome
1.

606941	TITLE *606941 ALG9, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; ALG9
;;DISRUPTED IN BIPOLAR DISORDER 1; DIBD1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Smith et al. (1989) and Baysal et al. (1998) described a small family in
which 5 individuals in 3 generations were affected with bipolar
affective disorder (BPAD; see 125480) and 1 individual was affected with
recurrent unipolar depression. All 6 affected individuals were carriers
of a balanced chromosomal translocation, t(9;11)(p24;q23). By gene
analysis of the breakpoint junctions, Baysal et al. (2002) identified
disruption of a novel gene at 11q23, which they symbolized DIBD1. The
predicted 611-amino acid DIBD1 protein is a mannosyltransferase similar
to the S. cerevisiae Alg9 protein of the N-glycosylation pathway and has
8 transmembrane helices. Northern blot analysis detected expression of
DIBD1 in all tissues tested, with highest expression in heart, liver,
and pancreas. The most abundant transcript was 2.5 kb, although 0.25-,
5.5-, and 7.0-kb transcripts were also observed. In subregions of the
brain, the 2.5- and 7.0-kb transcripts were expressed ubiquitously.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Baysal et al. (2002) determined that the
ALG9 gene has 15 exons and spans 85 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Baysal et al. (2002) mapped the ALG9 gene
to chromosome 11q23.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Using an intragenic polymorphism and other markers, Baysal et al. (2002)
performed linkage and linkage disequilibrium analyses in 2 National
Institute of Mental Health bipolar pedigree series and found no support
for a role of DIBD1 in disease susceptibility.

Frank et al. (2004) reported a female patient with a novel type of CDG I
(CDG Il; 608776). The authors detected a homozygous point mutation,
1567G-A (amino acid substitution E523K; 606941.0001) in the ALG9 gene. A
yeast complementation assay lacking the ALG9 gene confirmed the
deleterious effect of the E523K mutation as well as the functional
homology between the human and Saccharomyces cerevisiae ALG9.

Weinstein et al. (2005) reported a female infant with CDG Il in whom
they identified homozygosity for a missense mutation in the ALG9 gene
(Y286C; 606941.0002).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CONGENITAL DISORDER OF GLYCOSYLATION, TYPE Il
ALG9, GLU523LYS

Frank et al. (2004) described a novel type of congenital disorder of
glycosylation (CDG1L; 608776) in a female infant born at term as a twin
with a birth weight of 2.75 kg, length of 44 cm, and head circumference
of 31.5 cm. As she grew older, her clinical features included severe
microcephaly, central hypotonia, seizures, hepatomegaly, developmental
delay, and bronchial asthma. This pattern of clinical presentation was
compatible with CDG, a diagnosis confirmed by isoelectric focusing
analysis of serum transferrin. The patient's sample showed an increase
of disialo- and asialo-transferrin, indicative of CDG I. Normal values
of phosphomannomutase activity excluded the most frequent form of CDG,
type Ia (212065). The accumulation of 2 lipid-linked oligosaccharides
(LLOs) suggested a possible defect at the level of
alpha-1,2-mannosyltransferase, which, in yeast, catalyzes the addition
of the seventh and ninth mannose residues on growing LLOs. In the
patient, ALG9 cDNA was found to carry the point mutation 1567G-A, which
caused the amino acid change glu523-to-lys (E523K) in the ALG9 protein.
The mutation was also detected at the genomic level by sequencing exon
14 of the patient's ALG9 gene.

.0002
CONGENITAL DISORDER OF GLYCOSYLATION, TYPE Il
ALG9, TYR286CYS

In a female infant with CDG Il (608776), Weinstein et al. (2005)
identified homozygosity for an 860A-G transition in the ALG9 gene,
resulting in a tyr286-to-cys (Y286C) substitution. The parents were
heterozygous for the mutation.

608858	TITLE *608858 FIBROBLAST GROWTH FACTOR RECEPTOR 1 ONCOGENE PARTNER 2; FGFR1OP2
FGFR1OP2/FGFR1 FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Grand et al. (2004) identified the FGFR1OP2 gene through its involvement
in a fusion with the FGFR1 gene (136350). By 5-prime RACE of the fusion
transcript, followed by RT-PCR and genomic database analysis, they
identified full-length FGFR1OP2. The deduced 253-amino acid protein has
a calculated molecular mass of 29 kD and contains 4 potential
coiled-coil domains. Microarray data indicated that FGFR1OP2 is
expressed in diverse tissues, including bone marrow, spleen, and thymus.
FGFR1OP2 is highly conserved in evolution, sharing 99% and 98% amino
acid identity with its mouse and rat homologs, respectively. FGFR1OP2
homologs are also present in frog and insect genomes.

GENE STRUCTURE

Grand et al. (2004) determined that the FGR1OP2 gene contains 7 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Grand et al. (2004) mapped the FGFR1OP2
gene to chromosome 12p11.

- FGFR1OP2/FGFR1 Fusion Gene

Grand et al. (2004) identified a (12;8)(p11;p11p22) insertion in a
75-year-old male who presented with a T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma that
progressed rapidly to acute myelogenous leukemia. An obvious chronic
myeloproliferative disease was not apparent during the course of his
disease, but the clinical picture fit the overall pattern seen in
patients with 8p11 myeloproliferative syndrome (613523). In addition to
the insertion, bone marrow cytogenetics following development of AML
revealed loss of 1 copy of chromosome 7 in all cells analyzed. The
patient also showed mild eosinophilia with infiltration of the affected
lymph node and bone marrow by atypical eosinophils. Grand et al. (2004)
determined that the ins(12;8)(p11;p11p22) resulted in an in-frame fusion
of exon 4 of the FGFR1OP2 gene to exon 9 of the FGFR1 gene. The chimeric
protein contains 526 amino acids and has a calculated molecular mass of
60 kD. FGFR1OP2-FGFR1 has the first 2 coiled-coil domains of FGFR1OP2
fused to the entire tyrosine kinase domain and part of the juxtamembrane
region of FGFR1. Reciprocal FGFR1-FGFR1OP2 transcripts were not
detected. Since the direction of FGFR1OP2 transcription is in the
opposite orientation to the direction of FGFR1 transcription, an
inversion must have taken place in the formation of the chimeric gene.

602394	TITLE *602394 NUCLEOLAR AND COILED-BODY PHOSPHOPROTEIN 1; NOLC1
;;NUCLEOLAR PROTEIN, 130-KD; p130;;
NOPP140
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a monoclonal antibody-based strategy to search for nuclear
proteins that fluctuate during the cell cycle, Pai et al. (1995)
identified nucleolar protein p130. They cloned a cDNA encoding p130 by
immunoscreening a human HL60 cDNA library. The predicted 699-amino acid
protein contains a motif that consists of a long serine-rich stretch
interspersed with acidic residues; this motif is repeated 10 times. The
amino acid sequence of p130 is 74% identical to that of rat nucleolar
protein Nopp140, with the N and C termini and the serine-acidic
stretches showing the most conservation. Western blot analysis of
purified p130 showed that it is a 130-kD protein that is converted to 95
kD by phosphatase treatment. A cellular casein kinase II (115540,
115541, 115542) activity is responsible for the highly phosphorylated
state of p130. During mitosis, p130 may be subject to additional
phosphorylation by cdc2 kinase (116940). By immunofluorescence, p130 is
localized to the nucleoli of interphase cells but is undetectable in
cells in the mitotic phase. P130 appears as dot-like granules that are
assembled in the nucleoplasm at telophase and early G1-phase before
migrating into the nucleoli to form part of the dense fibrillar
component, the subnucleolar region for pre-rRNA synthesis and
processing. Pai et al. (1995) suggested that the functions of p130 are
related to nucleologenesis.

GENE FUNCTION

The human nuclear protein p130, which Chen et al. (1999) named NOPP140,
is thought to shuttle between nucleolus and cytoplasm. However, the
predominant nucleolar localization of NOPP140 homologs from different
species suggests that NOPP140 is also involved in events occurring
within the nucleolus. Chen et al. (1999) demonstrated that the largest
subunit of RNA polymerase I, RPA194, coimmunoprecipitates with NOPP140.
Double immunofluorescence showed that NOPP140 colocalizes with RNA
polymerase I at the active foci of rRNA gene (rDNA) transcription in the
nucleolus. These results suggest that NOPP140 can interact with RNA
polymerase I in vivo. Transfected cells expressing the N-terminal half
of NOPP140 displayed altered nucleoli with crescent-shaped structures.
This phenotype is reminiscent of the segregated nucleoli induced by
actinomycin D treatment, which is known to inhibit rRNA synthesis.
Consistently, the N-terminal half of NOPP140 mislocalized the endogenous
RNA polymerase I and shut off cellular rDNA transcription as revealed by
an in situ run-on assay. These dominant-negative effects of the
N-terminal half of NOPP140 suggest that NOPP140 plays an essential role
in rDNA transcription. Ectopic expression of NOPP140 to a very high
level caused the formation of a transcriptionally inactive spherical
structure that occupied the entire nucleolar area and trapped RNA
polymerase I, fibrillarin (FBL; 134795), and NOPP140 but excluded
nucleolin (NCL; 164035). The mislocalizations of these nucleolar
proteins after NOPP140 overexpression imply that NOPP140 may also play
roles in maintenance of nucleolar integrity.

Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA; 253300) is an autosomal recessive
neurodegenerative disease caused by reduced SMN (see SMN1; 600354)
levels. The assembly machinery containing SMN is implicated in the
biogenesis of the spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoproteins
(snRNPs). SMN is present in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it
transiently accumulates in subnuclear domains named Cajal bodies (CBs)
and functions in the maturation of snRNPs and small nucleolar (sno)RNPs.
Renvoise et al. (2009) showed that the U snRNA export factors PHAX
(RNUXA; 604924) and CRM1 (XPO1; 602559) and the box C/D snoRNP core
protein fibrillarin concentrated in CBs from SMA fibroblast cells,
whereas the box H/ACA core proteins GAR1 (NOLA1; 606468) and
NAP57/dyskerin (DKC1; 300126) showed reduced CB localization. The
functional deficiency in SMA cells was associated with decreased
localization of the snoRNP chaperone Nopp140 in CBs that correlated with
disease severity. RNA interference knockdown experiments in control
fibroblasts demonstrated that SMN was required for accumulation of
Nopp140 in CBs. Conversely, overexpression of SMN in SMA cells restored
the CB localization of Nopp140, whereas SMN mutants found in SMA
patients were defective in promoting the association of Nopp140 with
CBs. Renvoise et al. (2009) concluded that only a subset of CB functions
was impaired in SMA cells and that a decrease of Nopp140 localization in
CBs may be a phenotypic marker for SMA.

607478	TITLE *607478 TRYPTOPHAN HYDROXYLASE 2; TPH2
;;TRYPTOPHAN HYDROXYLASE, NEURONAL; NTPH
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH; EC 1.14.16.4) is the rate-limiting enzyme
in the synthesis of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, or 5HT). 5HT is
causally involved in numerous central nervous activities, and it has
several functions in peripheral tissues, including the maintenance of
vascular tone and gut motility.

CLONING

Using the TPH (191060) sequence as query, Walther et al. (2003)
identified a human genomic clone containing neuronal TPH, which they
designated TPH2. They subsequently cloned the full-length mouse Tph2
sequence, as well as the human and rat homologs. By RNase protection
assays specific for the Tph1 and Tph2 isoforms, they detected Tph1 mRNA
in mouse duodenum, but not in brain. Tph2, however, was detected
exclusively in brain. Mouse brainstem total RNA had about 150 times more
Tph2 than Tph1.

GENE FUNCTION

Walther et al. (2003) demonstrated that COS-7 cells expressing TPH2
acquired tryptophan-hydroxylating activity.

Zhang et al. (2004) created stable cell lines expressing variants of
Tph2 from mice of different genotypes and found that 5HT levels from
cells expressing arginine at position 447 were reduced by approximately
55% compared to cells expressing proline at position 447. BALB/cJ mice
showed approximately 50% and approximately 70% reductions in synthesis
of the 5HT precursor 5-hydroxytryptophan (5HTP) in the frontal and
cortex striatum, respectively, as compared with 129X1/SvJ mice. Zhang et
al. (2004) also found other differences in Tph2 genotypes in mice of
different strains that correlated with synthesis of 5HT. They concluded
that their data provided evidence for the fundamental role of TPH2 in
5HT synthesis in the central nervous system.

Clark et al. (2005) used in situ hybridization histochemistry and
real-time RT-PCR to assess the effects of dexamethasone or estradiol on
TPH2 mRNA levels in the dorsal raphe nucleus of both ovariectomized
female and intact male mice. They found that TPH2 mRNA was regulated by
glucocorticoids but not by estradiol. Clark et al. (2005) suggested that
glucocorticoid-mediated reduction of TPH2 message may have relevance to
the etiology of major depression in cases where elevated glucocorticoids
are one hallmark of the disease.

Using fMRI, Brown et al. (2005) found that a -844G-T SNP in the upstream
regulatory region of the TPH2 gene biased the reactivity of the
amygdala, suggesting that the T allele may be associated with greater
promoter activity.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Walther et al. (2003) mapped the TPH2 gene
to chromosome 12.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Association with Major Depressive Disorder

In individuals with unipolar major depression (see 608516), Zhang et al.
(2005) identified a 1463G-A transition (607478.0001) in the TPH2 gene.
This functional SNP in TPH2 replaces the highly conserved arg441 with
his (R441H), which resulted in approximately 80% loss of function in
serotonin production when TPH2 was expressed in PC12 cells. SNP analysis
in a cohort of 87 patients with unipolar major depression revealed that
9 patients carried the mutant allele, whereas among 219 controls, 3
subjects carried this mutation. In addition, this functional SNP was not
found in a cohort of 60 bipolar disorder patients. Identification of a
loss-of-function mutation in TPH2 suggested that a defect in brain
serotonin synthesis may represent an important risk factor for unipolar
major depression.

Garriock et al. (2005), however, found no evidence of the TPH2 R441H
mutation by sequence analysis of 182 patients with unipolar depression
(83 were treatment resistant), 186 nondepressed controls, and 8 bipolar
patients. The ethnicity and gender distribution was similar to that
studied by Zhang et al. (2005).

- Association with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder

Walitza et al. (2005) investigated the effect of polymorphic variants in
the TPH2 gene in 225 children with ADHD (143465) in 103 families. Three
SNPs in and downstream of the transcriptional control region were
assessed using the pedigree disequilibrium test. Preferential
transmissions were detected for 2 of the SNPs (dbSNP rs4570625, p =
0.049; dbSNP rs11178997, p = 0.034). Haplotype analysis revealed a trend
of association between these 2 SNPs and ADHD (p = 0.064).

McKinney et al. (2008) identified a heterozygous mutation in the TPH2
gene (R303W; 607478.0002) in a mother and daughter with ADHD (ADHD7;
613003). In vitro functional expression studies showed loss of enzyme
activity.

- Association with Bipolar Disorder

In 2 cohorts of patients with bipolar affective disorder (BPAD; 125480)
from Germany and Russia totaling 883 patients and 1,300 controls, Cichon
et al. (2008) observed an association between disease and the minor
alleles of 3 SNPs in haplotype 1 of the TPH2 gene (dbSNP rs11178997,
dbSNP rs11178998, and dbSNP rs7954758; odds ratio of 1.6, p value of
0.00073). Haplotype 1 covers part of the 5-prime regulatory region and
exons 1 and 2 of the TPH2 gene. Cichon et al. (2008) also observed an
association between bipolar disorder and a nonsynonymous SNP in the TPH2
gene (P206S; 607478.0003).

ANIMAL MODEL

Beaulieu et al. (2008) generated knockin mice with a Tph2 variant
similar to the human R441H variant. Expression of this mutant Tph2
resulted in markedly decreased brain 5HT production and behavioral
abnormalities related to depression and anxiety. The reduction of 5HT
was associated with activation of Gsk3b (605004) in the frontal cortex.
Inactivation of Gsk3b in Tph2 knockin mice alleviated the aberrant
behaviors induced by 5HT deficiency. Beaulieu et al. (2008) concluded
that Tph2 plays a role in serotonin homeostasis and identified
GSK3B-mediated signaling as an important pathway involved in
serotonin-related behaviors.

Alenina et al. (2009) found that Tph2-null mice were viable, but showed
growth retardation and 50% lethality within the first 4 weeks of life,
although some survived into adulthood. Tph2-null mice had significantly
decreased serotonin levels in all brain regions analyzed. They
demonstrated more extended daytime sleep, suppressed respiration,
altered body temperature control, and decreased heart rate and blood
pressure during the night. Tph2-null females showed impaired maternal
care and increased aggression. Alenina et al. (2009) concluded that most
serotonin in the central nervous system is generated by Tph2, and that
this serotonin is involved in behavior and autonomic regulation.

Liu et al. (2011) reported that the neurotransmitter 5HT is required for
male sexual preference. Wildtype male mice preferred females over males,
but males lacking central serotonergic neurons lost sexual preference
although they were not generally defective in olfaction or in pheromone
sensing. A role for 5HT was demonstrated by the phenotype of mice
lacking Tph2, which is required for the first step of 5HT synthesis in
the brain. Thirty-five minutes after the injection of the intermediate
5-hydroxytryptophan (5HTP), which circumvented Tph2 to restore 5HT to
the wildtype level, adult Tph2 knockout mice also preferred females over
males. Liu et al. (2011) concluded that 5HT and serotonergic neurons in
the adult brain regulate mammalian sexual preference.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
UNIPOLAR DEPRESSION, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
TPH2, ARG441HIS

Zhang et al. (2005) identified a G-to-A transition at nucleotide 1463 of
the TPH2 gene that replaces the highly conserved arg at position 441
with his (R441H). This mutation resulted in an approximately 80% loss of
function in serotonin production when TPH2 was expressed in PC12 cells.
SNP analysis in a cohort of 87 patients with unipolar major depression
(see 608516) revealed that 9 patients carried the mutant allele, while
among 219 controls, 3 subjects carried this mutation. Interestingly,
depressed patients carrying this mutation were poorly responsive or
unresponsive to SSRIs. The 3 control subjects carrying this mutation
were not diagnosed as having unipolar major depression, but they
displayed clinical symptoms of comorbid conditions. One of the 3 control
subjects, carrying homozygous mutant alleles, had generalized anxiety
symptoms, while the other 2, carrying heterozygous alleles, had mild
depression and a family history of mental illness or drug and alcohol
abuse, suggesting a potentially higher susceptibility for certain
neuropsychiatric disorders in the presence of the mutant allele. This
mutation was not identified in 60 patients with bipolar disorder.
Garriock et al. (2005), however, found no evidence of the TPH2 R441H
mutation by sequence analysis of 182 patients with unipolar depression
(83 were treatment resistant), 186 nondepressed controls, and 8 bipolar
patients. The ethnicity and gender distribution was similar to that
studied by Zhang et al. (2005).

By in vitro functional expression studies, McKinney et al. (2009)
demonstrated that the R441H mutant protein had moderately decreased
stability and solubility, as well as decreased activity (9% of
wildtype). The substitution is within the catalytic domain of the
protein.

ATTENTION DEFICIT-HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, 7
TPH2, ARG303TRP

In a Norwegian woman with ADHD (ADHD7; 613003), McKinney et al. (2008)
identified a heterozygous 907C-T transition in exon 7 of the TPH2 gene,
resulting in an arg303-to-trp (R303W) substitution in a highly conserved
residue located at the entry of the active site. The patient also had a
history of major depression. Her daughter, who also carried the
mutation, had ADHD. Both reported an excellent response to stimulant
medication. The mutation was not found in 323 additional ADHD patients
or 87 controls. In vitro functional expression studies showed that the
mutant protein had less than 5% residual enzyme activity and decreased
solubility, compatible with a folding defect or increased hydrophobicity
of the mutant protein. McKinney et al. (2008) concluded that a
loss-of-function TPH2 mutation leads to reduced serotonin synthesis,
which may result in increased susceptibility to ADHD and possibly other
psychiatric disorders.

.0003
BIPOLAR AFFECTIVE DISORDER, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
TPH2, PRO206SER

Cichon et al. (2008) found an association between a 757C-T transition in
exon 6 of the TPH2 gene, resulting in a pro206-to-ser (P206S)
substitution (dbSNP rs17110563) and bipolar affective disorder (125480)
in 2 cohorts from Germany and Russia, totaling 883 patients and 1,300
controls. In the combined sample, the ser206 allele yielded an odds
ratio of 4.8 for development of the disorder (p value of 0.0024). In
vitro functional expression studies showed that the P206S protein had
similar catalytic activity as wildtype, but decreased solubility and
thermal stability. Further studies suggested a mild dominant-negative
effect.

By in vitro functional expression studies, McKinney et al. (2009)
demonstrated that the P206S protein had significantly decreased
stability and solubility, as well as decreased activity compared to
wildtype. P206S is located on surface-exposed side chains and may result
in reduced stability.

608081	TITLE *608081 SYNAPTOTAGMIN 15; SYT15
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SYT15 belongs to the synaptotagmin family of membrane trafficking
proteins. Synaptotagmins contain a short extracellular domain, a single
N-terminal transmembrane domain, and tandem C2 domains that can bind
several Ca(2+) ions.

CLONING

Fukuda (2003) cloned SYT15 from mouse, rat, and human tissues by PCR
using primers based on the SYT15 genomic sequence from each species.
They identified 2 alternately spliced transcripts of human SYT15 that
encode proteins with different C termini. The 421-amino acid isoform,
designated SYT15a, contains a short N-terminal transmembrane region
followed by putative fatty-acylation sites and 2 tandem C-terminal C2
domains. The 390-amino acid isoform, designated SYT15b, lacks the
C-terminal portion of the second C2 domain. SYT15a shares about 79%
identity with mouse Syt15a. RT-PCR of several mouse tissues revealed
expression of both variants in heart, lung, skeletal muscle, and testis,
as well as in 7-day embryos. Unlike several other synaptotagmins,
expression of Syt15 was nearly absent in mouse brain.

GENE FUNCTION

By expression of wildtype mouse Syt15a and a truncated mutant in COS-7
cells, Fukuda (2003) determined that the protein is expressed at the
membrane and that the N-terminal hydrophobic region is required for
membrane association. Fukuda (2003) also showed that Syt15a bound
phospholipids in a Ca(2+)-independent manner.

GENE STRUCTURE

Fukuda (2003) determined that the human SYT15 gene contains 9 exons and
the mouse and rat Syt15 genes contain 8 exons. The genes span 10 to 12
kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Craxton (2001) and Fukuda (2003) mapped
the SYT15 gene to chromosome 10. Fukuda (2003) mapped the mouse Syt15
gene to chromosome 14.

;;HEPARAN GLUCOSAMINYL N-DEACETYLASE/N-SULFOTRANSFERASE 2;;
HEPARAN SULFATE N-DEACETYLASE/N-SULFOTRANSFERASE 2;;
HEPARAN N-SULFOTRANSFERASE 2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The initial step in the processing of heparan polymers to heparan
sulfate or heparin is N-deacetylation/N-sulfation. This step is
catalyzed by heparan N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferases, such as NDST2
(Humphries et al., 1998).

CLONING

Using PCR of human endothelial cell cDNA with primers based on the
sequence of rat liver Ndst1 (600853), Humphries et al. (1998) isolated a
partial NDST2 cDNA. Using the partial cDNA to screen endothelial cell
and fibroblast libraries, they isolated cDNAs corresponding to the
entire NDST2 coding region. The predicted 883-amino acid protein is 70%
similar to NDST1. Northern blot analysis revealed that NDST2 was
expressed as a 4-kb mRNA and a less abundant 4.4-kb mRNA in all human
tissues tested. The strongest expression was observed in pancreas.

Orellana et al. (1994) and Eriksson et al. (1994) cloned cDNAs encoding
a heparan N-sulfotransferase from a heparin-producing mouse mastocytoma
cell line. Humphries et al. (1998) reported that the predicted mouse
protein is 94% identical to NDST2.

Aikawa et al. (2001) cloned mouse Ndst2, which encodes a deduced
883-amino acid protein. RT-PCR detected high Ndst2 expression in all
adult mouse tissues examined and in whole mouse embryos at all
developmental stages examined.

GENE FUNCTION

Using N-acetylheparosan purified from E. coli capsular polysaccharide as
substrate, Aikawa et al. (2001) found that recombinant mouse Ndst
enzymes showed distinct ratios of N-acetylglucosamine N-deacetylase to
N-sulfotransferase activities. Ndst2 had similarly robust activity in
both reactions with this substrate.

GENE STRUCTURE

Humphries et al. (1998) determined that the NDST2 gene contains 13 exons
spanning 6.5 kb. The 12 introns that interrupt the coding region occur
at similar sites within the coding sequence of NDST1. The similarity of
the NDST2 and NDST1 genomic organization and encoded proteins suggested
to Humphries et al. (1998) that the 2 genes derive from a common
ancestral gene.

Ahmed et al. (2001) stated that NDST2 is 1 of 3 genes that are nested in
the introns of PCDH15 (605514).

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Humphries et al. (1998) mapped
the NDST2 gene to 10q22.

EVOLUTION

Aikawa et al. (2001) determined that 3 gene duplication events likely
occurred to give rise to the 4 vertebrate NDST genes. They proposed that
after the initial gene duplication event, a duplication produced NDST1
and NDST2, followed by a much later duplication that produced NDST3
(603950) and NDST4 (615039).

ANIMAL MODEL

Forsberg et al. (1999) and Humphries et al. (1999) independently
targeted disruption of the mouse Ndst2 gene by homologous recombination.
Humphries et al. (1999) found that mast cells in the skeletal muscle
that normally contain heparin lacked metachromatic granules and failed
to store appreciable amounts of mouse mast-cell protease-4, mast-cell
protease-5, and mast-cell carboxypeptidase A (114851). Mast cells
developed from the bone marrow of the Ndst2 -/- mice contained high
levels of various protease transcripts and had substantial amounts of
mast-cell protease-6 (191080) protein in their granules. However, they
failed to express mast-cell protease-5 and mast-cell carboxypeptidase A.
Humphries et al. (1999) concluded that heparin controls, through a
posttranslational mechanism, the levels of specific cassettes of
positively charged proteases inside mast cells. Forsberg et al. (1999)
found that their Ndst2 knockout mice were unable to synthesize sulfated
heparin. The mice were viable and fertile, as were those of Humphries et
al. (1999), but had fewer connective tissue-type mast cells. The
connective tissue-type mast cells had an altered morphology and
contained severely reduced amounts of histamine and mast-cell proteases.
Commenting on the papers by Forsberg et al. (1999) and Humphries et al.
(1999), Zehnder and Galli (1999) stated that heparin had long been
thought to be a storage site in the mast-cell granule for the positively
charged amines histamine and serotonin. Forsberg et al. (1999) reported
that the peritoneal mast cells in their Ndst2-deficient mice showed a
large--roughly 94%--reduction in cell-associated histamine. Humphries et
al. (1999), however, reported a more modest reduction of about 30%.
Zehnder and Galli (1999) suggested that the discrepancies may be related
to the variation in the age of the mice studied, as mast cells can be
long-lived and accumulate additional granules with age, or that the
differences may be strain-dependent.

605353	TITLE *605353 GHRELIN; GHRL
;;GROWTH HORMONE SECRETAGOGUE RECEPTOR LIGAND;;
MOTILIN-RELATED PEPTIDE
OBESTATIN, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Ghrelin is an endogenous ligand for the growth hormone secretagogue
receptor (GHSR; 601898) and is involved in regulating growth hormone
(GH; 139250) release. Ghrelin is derived from a preprohormone called
preproghrelin, which also generates a second peptide called obestatin
(Zhang et al., 2005). Obestatin is an endogenous ligand for the orphan G
protein-coupled receptor GPR39 (602886) and is involved in satiety and
decreased food intake.

CLONING

Small synthetic molecules called growth hormone secretagogues (GHSs)
stimulate the release of growth hormone from the pituitary. They act
through the growth hormone secretagogue receptor, a G protein-coupled
receptor. Kojima et al. (1999) reported the purification and
identification in rat stomach of an endogenous ligand specific for GHSR.
The purified ligand is a peptide of 28 amino acids in which the serine-3
residue is n-octanoylated. The acylated peptide specifically releases GH
both in vivo and in vitro, and O-n-octanoylation at serine-3 is
essential for the activity. Kojima et al. (1999) designated the
GH-releasing peptide 'ghrelin' ('ghre' is the Proto-Indo-European root
of the word 'grow'). Human ghrelin is homologous to rat ghrelin apart
from 2 amino acids. The occurrence of ghrelin in both rat and human
indicates that GH release from the pituitary may be regulated not only
by hypothalamic growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH; 139190), but
also by ghrelin. Human preproghrelin, isolated from a stomach cDNA
library, consists of 117 amino acids. Rat and human preproghrelins are
82.9% identical. Northern blot analysis of rat tissues showed that
preproghrelin mRNA of 0.62 kb occurs in stomach. In situ hybridization
indicated that ghrelin mRNA is found in the region from the neck to the
base of the oxyntic gland. Ghrelin-immunoreactive cells in the stomach
have the same distribution as that found using in situ hybridization.
The distribution pattern and morphologic features of the labeled and
immunostained cells showed that ghrelin cells are endocrine cells.

Kojima et al. (1999) detected a ghrelin transcript in brain by RT-PCR
amplification but not by Northern blot analysis. Immunohistochemical
analyses performed after colchicine treatment revealed that
ghrelin-immunoreactive neurons were localized in the hypothalamic
arcuate nucleus.

Tanaka et al. (2001) cloned a splice variant of mouse ghrelin, which
they called ghrelin gene-derived transcript (GGDT), from adult mouse
testis. The variant encodes a deduced 54-amino acid peptide generated by
alternative exon 1 usage and alternative splicing. Northern blot
analysis showed that GGDT expression is limited to the mouse testis and
is developmentally regulated, being absent in testis at 2 weeks of age
and increasing to reach adult expression levels at 4 weeks of age.
Tanaka et al. (2001) found no significant change in the abundance of
full-length ghrelin mRNA in the stomach from 2 to 8 weeks of age.

- Obestatin

Zhang et al. (2005) searched for orthologs of the human ghrelin gene and
compared preproghrelin sequences from 11 mammalian species. In addition
to the known ghrelin mature peptide, which immediately follows the
signal peptide, they identified another conserved region that was
flanked by potential convertase cleavage sites. This region encoded a
putative 23-amino acid peptide with a flanking conserved glycine residue
at the C terminus, suggesting that it might be amidated. Zhang et al.
(2005) named this ghrelin-associated peptide obestatin, from the Latin
'obedere,' to devour, and 'statin,' denoting suppression.

GENE FUNCTION

Kojima et al. (1999) found that ghrelin circulates in healthy human
blood at a considerable plasma concentration (117.2 +/- 37.2
fmol/ml(-1); n = 6); this, together with the finding that ghrelin, when
injected intravenously, induces GH release, suggested to the authors
that this molecule is produced in and secreted from the stomach,
circulating in the bloodstream to act on the pituitary.

Takaya et al. (2000) studied GH-releasing activity and other effects
generated by ghrelin in 4 normal men aged 28 to 37 years. They
demonstrated that ghrelin strongly stimulates GH release in humans in a
dose-dependent manner. Per mol, ghrelin is more potent for GH release
than GHRH. The lowest dose of ghrelin used (0.2 microg/kg) led to
massive GH release (43.3 +/- 6.0 ng/mL), with minimum effects on ACTH or
PRL (176760). Ghrelin administration did not change serum LH (see
118850), FSH (136530), or TSH (188540) levels.

Kluge et al. (2007) investigated the effect of pulsatile ghrelin
administration on the nocturnal secretion patterns of LH and
testosterone in 10 healthy young men. They found that ghrelin caused
both a delay and suppression of the amplitude of LH pulses. They
concluded that, as in nonhuman mammals, ghrelin may affect the
hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis predominantly by suppressing
secretion of LH.

Tschop et al. (2000) showed that peripheral daily administration of
ghrelin caused weight gain by reducing fat utilization in mice and rats.
Intracerebroventricular administration of ghrelin generated a
dose-dependent increase in food intake and body weight. Rat serum
ghrelin concentrations were increased by fasting and were reduced by
refeeding or oral glucose administration, but not by water ingestion.
Tschop et al. (2000) proposed that ghrelin, in addition to its role in
regulating GH secretion, signals the hypothalamus when an increase in
metabolic efficiency is necessary.

Nakazato et al. (2001) demonstrated that ghrelin is involved in the
hypothalamic regulation of energy homeostasis. Intracerebroventricular
injections of ghrelin strongly stimulated feeding in rats and increased
body weight gain. Ghrelin also increased feeding in rats that were
genetically deficient in growth hormone. Antighrelin immunoglobulin G
robustly suppressed feeding. After intracerebroventricular ghrelin
administration, FOS protein (164810), a marker of neuronal activation,
was found in regions of primary importance in the regulation of feeding,
including neuropeptide Y (NPY; 162640) neurons and agouti-related
protein (AGRP; 602311) neurons. Antibodies and antagonists of NPY and
AGRP abolished ghrelin-induced feeding. Ghrelin augmented NPY gene
expression and blocked leptin (LEP; 164160)-induced feeding reduction,
implying that there is a competitive interaction between ghrelin and
leptin in feeding regulation. Nakazato et al. (2001) concluded that
ghrelin is a physiologic mediator of feeding and probably has a function
in growth regulation by stimulating feeding and release of growth
hormone.

Date et al. (2001) demonstrated a role for ghrelin in the central
regulation of gastric function. Specifically, intracerebroventricular
administration of ghrelin stimulated gastric acid secretion in a
dose-dependent and atropine-sensitive manner. Vagotomy abolished gastric
acid secretion. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated the induction of Fos
expression in the nucleus of the solitary tract and dorsomotor nucleus
of the rat vagus nerve.

Cummings et al. (2002) investigated plasma ghrelin levels after weight
loss induced by diet or by gastric bypass surgery. They reasoned that if
circulating ghrelin participates in the adaptive response to weight
loss, its levels should rise with dieting. Because ghrelin is produced
primarily in the stomach, weight loss after gastric bypass surgery might
be accompanied by impaired ghrelin secretion. They found an increase in
the plasma ghrelin level with diet-induced weight loss. Gastric bypass
was associated with markedly suppressed ghrelin levels, possibly
contributing to the weight-reducing effect of the procedure.

Leonetti et al. (2003) observed a significant difference in plasma
ghrelin levels between laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGBP)
and laparoscopic adjustable silicone gastric banding (LASGB), suggesting
that each procedure could induce weight loss by a different mechanism in
which ghrelin could be involved.

Kojima et al. (2001) reviewed the role of ghrelin. This peptide is found
in the secretory granules of X/A-like cells, a distinct endocrine cell
type found in the submucosal layer of the stomach (Date et al., 2000).
These cells contain round, compact, electron-dense granules and are
filled with ghrelin. Ghrelin immunoreactive cells are also found in the
small and large intestines.

Cowley et al. (2003) discovered expression of ghrelin in a theretofore
uncharacterized group of neurons adjacent to the third ventricle between
the dorsal, ventral, paraventricular, and arcuate hypothalamic nuclei.
These neurons send efferents onto key hypothalamic circuits, including
those producing NPY, AGRP, proopiomelanocortin (POMC; 176830) products,
and corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH; 122560). Within the
hypothalamus, ghrelin bound mostly on presynaptic terminals of NPY
neurons. Using electrophysiologic recordings, Cowley et al. (2003) found
that ghrelin stimulated the activity of arcuate NPY neurons and mimicked
the effect of NPY in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus.
Cowley et al. (2003) proposed that at these sites, release of ghrelin
may stimulate the release of orexigenic peptides and neurotransmitters,
thus representing a novel regulatory circuit controlling energy
homeostasis.

Abizaid et al. (2006) demonstrated that ghrelin bound to neurons of the
ventral tegmental area (VTA) in mice and rats, where it triggered
increased dopamine neuronal activity, synapse formation, and dopamine
turnover in the nucleus accumbens in a Ghsr-dependent manner. Direct VTA
administration of ghrelin triggered feeding, while intra-VTA delivery of
a selective Ghsr antagonist blocked the orexigenic effect of circulating
ghrelin and blunted rebound feeding following fasting. In addition,
ghrelin- and Ghsr-deficient mice showed attenuated feeding responses to
restricted feeding schedules.

Dixit et al. (2004) demonstrated that ghrelin and its receptor, GHSR,
are expressed in human T lymphocytes and monocytes, where ghrelin acts
via GHSR to inhibit specifically the expression of proinflammatory
anorectic cytokines such as IL1-beta (147720), IL6 (147620), and
TNF-alpha (191160). Ghrelin led to a dose-dependent inhibition of
leptin-induced cytokine expression, whereas leptin upregulated GHSR
expression on human T lymphocytes. Dixit et al. (2004) proposed the
existence of a reciprocal regulatory network by which ghrelin and leptin
control immune cell activation and inflammation. In a murine model of
endotoxemia, Dixit et al. (2004) also showed that ghrelin has potent
antiinflammatory effects and attenuates endotoxin-induced anorexia.

Pagotto et al. (2003) investigated circulating ghrelin levels in a group
of hypogonadal men before and after therapeutic intervention aiming at
normalization of low testosterone concentrations. After the 6-month
replacement testosterone therapy, ghrelin levels of hypogonadal patients
increased and did not differ significantly in comparison with both
control groups. The positive correlation between ghrelin and androgens
still persisted after testosterone replacement therapy, after adjusting
for confounding variables. The authors concluded that androgens modulate
circulating ghrelin concentrations in humans.

Farquhar et al. (2003) measured ghrelin in neonates who were small
(SGA), appropriate (AGA), or large (LGA) for gestational age and
observed that ghrelin concentration was 40% higher in SGA neonates
compared with AGA and LGA neonates. There was a positive correlation
between ghrelin and gestational age in AGA/LGA and a negative
correlation in SGA neonates. The authors suggested that ghrelin may play
a physiologic role in fetal adaptation to intrauterine malnutrition.

To determine whether ghrelin releases GH by a pituitary or a
hypothalamic action, Popovic et al. (2003) compared a group of patients
with organic lesions mainly in the hypothalamic area with matched
controls. Patients showed a severe GH deficiency after hypothalamic
stimulation by insulin tolerance test, but partial response after GHRH
(139190) administration. The authors concluded that when hypothalamic
structures are not operative, ghrelin, either alone or in combination
with GHRH, is not able to significantly release GH. The authors
postulated a hypothalamic point of action for ghrelin-induced GH
secretion.

The studies of Corbetta et al. (2003) suggested that carcinoids and
pancreatic tumors rarely cause ghrelin hypersecretion. However, in this
series, 1 pancreatic ghrelinoma not associated with clinical features of
acromegaly was identified.

After administration of ghrelin, Doi et al. (2006) observed increases in
Ia2-beta (PTPRN2; 601698) in mouse brain, pancreas, and insulinoma cell
lines, but not Ia2 (PTPRN; 601773). Administration of ghrelin or
overexpression of Ia2-beta inhibited glucose-stimulated insulin
secretion in insulinoma cells, and inhibition of Ia2-beta overexpression
by RNA interference ameliorated ghrelin's inhibitory effects on
glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Doi et al. (2006) suggested that
the inhibitory effects of ghrelin on glucose-stimulated insulin
secretion are at least partly due to increased expression of Ia2-beta
induced by ghrelin.

Leidy et al. (2004) studied the effects of a 3-month energy
deficit-imposing diet and exercise intervention on circulating ghrelin
in healthy women of normal weight. Ghrelin significantly increased over
time in the weight-loss group compared with the controls and the
weight-stable group (P less than 0.05). Changes in ghrelin were
negatively correlated with changes in body weight (r = -0.61; P less
than 0.05). Body fat, body weight, and resting metabolic rate
significantly decreased in the weight-loss group before the increase in
ghrelin. The authors concluded that ghrelin responds in a compensatory
manner to changes in energy homeostasis in healthy young women, and that
ghrelin exhibits particular sensitivity to changes in body weight.

Yang et al. (2008) found that mouse Goat (MBOAT4; 611940) octanoylated
ghrelin following cotransfection of Goat and preproghrelin in cultured
endocrine cell lines. Mutation analysis showed that Goat octanoylated
ghrelin on ser3, a modification required for its endocrine effects.

Checchi et al. (2007) studied the diagnostic use of the measurement of
serum ghrelin compared with other markers of gastric damage in
predicting the presence of atrophic body gastritis (ABG) in patients
with autoimmune gastritis. All 233 patients with autoimmune gastritis
and 211 control subjects were screened for circulating parietal cell
antibodies (PCAs) and were tested for serum ghrelin, gastrin (137250),
pepsinogen I (see 169700) and II (169740), and anti-Helicobacter pylori
antibody levels. A total of 52 patients and 28 control subjects
underwent a gastric endoscopy. In PCA/positive patients, mean serum
ghrelin levels were significantly lower, and mean serum gastrin levels
were significantly higher with respect to PCA/negative patients. Checchi
et al. (2007) concluded that ghrelin secretion is negatively affected by
autoimmune gastritis, and its serum level represents the most sensitive
and specific noninvasive marker for selecting patients at high risk for
ABG.

Andrews et al. (2008) showed that ghrelin initiates robust changes in
hypothalamic mitochondrial respiration in mice that are dependent on
uncoupling protein-2 (UCP2; 601693). Activation of this mitochondrial
mechanism is critical for ghrelin-induced mitochondrial proliferation
and electric activation of NPY (162640)/AgRP (602311) neurons, for
ghrelin-triggered synaptic plasticity of proopiomelanocortin (POMC;
176830)-expressing neurons, and for ghrelin-induced food intake. The
UCP2-dependent action of ghrelin on NPY/AgRP neurons is driven by a
hypothalamic fatty acid oxidation pathway involving AMPK (see 602739),
CPT1 (600528), and free radicals that are scavenged by UCP2. Andrews et
al. (2008) concluded that their results revealed a signaling modality
connecting mitochondria-mediated effects of G protein-coupled receptors
on neuronal function and associated behavior.

In studies in mice lacking Mboat4 and mice overexpressing Mboat4,
Kirchner et al. (2009) demonstrated that Mboat4 is regulated by nutrient
availability, depends on specific dietary lipids as acylation
substrates, and links ingested lipids to energy expenditure and body fat
mass. Kirchner et al. (2009) concluded that ghrelin acylation and the
secretion of acylated ghrelin probably represent 2 independent
processes, and that the ghrelin-MBOAT4 system is a signaling pathway
that alerts the central nervous system to the presence of dietary
calories, rather than to their absence, as had been commonly accepted.

- Role in Prader-Willi Syndrome

To determine whether ghrelin is elevated in Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS;
176270), Delparigi et al. (2002) measured fasting plasma ghrelin
concentration, body composition, and subjective ratings of hunger in 7
subjects with PWS and 30 healthy subjects who had fasted overnight. The
mean plasma ghrelin concentration was higher in PWS than in the
reference population and this difference remained significant after
adjustment for percentage of body fat. A positive correlation was found
between plasma ghrelin and subjective ratings of hunger. The authors
concluded that ghrelin is elevated in subjects with PWS. They also
suggested that ghrelin may be responsible, at least in part, for the
hyperphagia observed in PWS.

Haqq et al. (2003) measured fasting serum ghrelin levels in children
with PWS with an average age of 9.5 years and body mass index (BMI) of
31.3 kilograms per square meter. The PWS group was compared with 4
control groups: normal weight controls, obese children, and children
with melanocortin-4 receptor mutations and leptin deficiency. Ghrelin
levels in children with PWS were significantly elevated (3-4 fold)
compared with BMI-matched obese controls. The authors concluded that
elevation of serum ghrelin levels to the degree documented in this study
may play a role as an orexigenic factor driving the insatiable appetite
and obesity found in PWS.

Feigerlova et al. (2008) studied total plasma ghrelin levels in 40
children with PWS and 84 controls from 2 months to 17 years. Plasma
ghrelin levels were higher in children with PWS than controls, both in
the youngest children below 3 years who were not receiving GH (139250)
(771 vs 233 pg/ml, P less than 0.0001) and in the children older than 3
years, all of whom were treated with GH (428 vs 159 pg/ml, P less than
0.0001). The authors concluded that plasma ghrelin levels in children
with PWS are elevated at any age, including during the first years of
life, thus preceding the development of obesity.

- Obestatin

In addition to ghrelin, the preproghrelin peptide also produces
obestatin. Contrary to the appetite-stimulating effects of ghrelin,
Zhang et al. (2005) demonstrated that treatment of rats with obestatin
suppressed food intake, inhibited jejunal contraction, and decreased
body weight gain. Intraperitoneal injection of amidated human obestatin
in adult male mice resulted in suppressed food intake in a time- and
dose-dependent manner. Intracerebroventricular treatment with obestatin
also decreased food intake, similar to the anorexigenic effect of the
synthetic melanocortin (176830) agonist MTII (melanotan-II). In
contrast, treatment with the nonamidated obestatin was less effective.

Chartrel et al. (2007) were unable to reproduce the finding of Zhang et
al. (2005) that obestatin bound to the orphan G protein-coupled receptor
GPR39 (602886). In response to the comments by Chartrel et al. (2007),
Zhang et al. (2007) stated that they also could not reproduce this
finding. However, Zhang et al. (2007) stated that they could reproduce
their original findings on the in vivo effects of obestatin in mice
(decrease in food intake, gastric emptying responses, and body weight
gain) under precise experimental conditions.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Korbonits et al. (2002) studied the ghrelin gene in a group of 70 tall
and obese children. They found 10 SNPs. One common polymorphism of the
ghrelin gene, leu72 to met (L72M; 605353.0002), corresponding to an
amino acid change in the tail of the preproghrelin molecule, was
significantly associated with children with a higher BMI (P = 0.001),
and with lower insulin secretion during the first part of an oral
glucose tolerance test (P = 0.05), although no difference in glucose
levels was noted. The authors concluded that variations in the ghrelin
gene contribute to obesity in children and may modulate glucose-induced
insulin secretion.

Ukkola et al. (2001) reported an arg51-to-gln polymorphism (R51Q;
605353.0001) in the ghrelin gene associated with obesity.

Hinney et al. (2002) screened the ghrelin coding region in 215 extremely
obese German children and adolescents (study group 1) and 93
normal-weight students (study group 2) by single-strand conformation
polymorphism analysis (SSCP). They found 2 previously described SNPs,
R51Q (605353.0001) and L72M (605353.0002), in similar frequencies in
study groups 1 and 2. Hence, they could not confirm the previous
finding. Additionally, 2 novel variants were identified within the
coding region. They detected a nonconservative amino acid change from
gln to leu at codon 90 (605353.0003). They also detected a frameshift
mutation (605353.0004) in 1 healthy normal-weight individual. The
authors concluded that none of the variants seem to influence weight
regulation.

To determine whether mutations in GHRL influence eating behavior and
risk for metabolic syndrome (see 605552), obesity, diabetes, and related
traits, Steinle et al. (2005) genotyped 856 Amish samples for 3 missense
polymorphisms in GHRL, R51Q (605363.0001), L72M (605363.0002) (dbSNP
rs696217), and Q90L (605363.0003) (dbSNP rs4684677) and performed
association analyses with eating behavior traits and metabolic syndrome.
The prevalence of metabolic syndrome was lower among those carrying the
51Q allele (3.8 vs 15.8%; age- and sex-adjusted odds ratio = 0.22; P =
0.031). The L72M variant was also associated with increased prevalence
of metabolic syndrome (23.2 vs 13.4%; age- and sex-adjusted odds ratio =
2.57; P = 0.02) as well as higher fasting glucose, lower high density
lipoprotein, and higher triglyceride levels (P = 0.02, P = 0.007, and P
= 0.04, respectively). The 2 variants were not in linkage disequilibrium
with each other, suggesting independent effects. The authors concluded
that mutations in GHRL may confer risk for the metabolic syndrome.

MAPPING

Scott (2000) mapped the human gene encoding ghrelin to 3p26-p25 based on
sequence similarity between the ghrelin precursor (GenBank GENBANK
AB029434) and a BAC (GenBank GENBANK AC008116) mapped to 3p26-p25.

ANIMAL MODEL

Wortley et al. (2004) generated ghrelin-null mice which were viable and
exhibited normal growth rates as well as normal spontaneous food intake
patterns, normal basal levels of hypothalamic orexigenic and
anorexigenic neuropeptides, and no impairment of reflexive hyperphagia
after fasting. Wortley et al. (2004) concluded that endogenous ghrelin
is not an essential regulator of food intake. Analyses of the
ghrelin-null mice demonstrated increased use of fat as a fuel source
when placed on a high-fat diet, indicating that endogenous ghrelin plays
a prominent role in determining the type of metabolic substrate (e.g.,
fat vs carbohydrate) that is used for maintenance of energy balance,
particularly under conditions of high fat intake.

Wortley et al. (2005) demonstrated that male Ghrl-null mice are
protected from the rapid weight gain induced by early exposure to a
high-fat diet; the reduced weight gain was associated with decreased
adiposity and increased energy expenditure and locomotor activity as the
animals aged. Despite the absence of ghrelin, these Ghrl-null mice
showed a paradoxical preservation of the GH/IGF1 (147440) axis. Wortley
et al. (2005) suggested that endogenous ghrelin plays an important role
in the metabolic adaptation to nutrient availability.

Zigman et al. (2005) generated Ghsr (601898)-null mice and observed that
ghrelin administration failed to acutely stimulate food intake or
activate arcuate nucleus neurons. When fed a high-fat diet, both female
and male Ghsr-null mice ate less food, stored less of their consumed
calories, preferentially utilized fat as an energy substrate, and
accumulated less body weight and adiposity than control mice. Ghsr-null
mice also demonstrated statistically significant reductions in both
respiratory quotient and locomotor activity compared to wildtype, and
their blood glucose levels were significantly lower than wildtype mice
of similar weight and body composition. Zigman et al. (2005) concluded
that ghrelin-responsive pathways are an important component of
coordinated body weight control, and suggested that ghrelin signaling is
required for development of the full phenotype of diet-induced obesity.

In rats undergoing chronic intracerebroventricular infusion of ghrelin,
Theander-Carrillo et al. (2006) observed increases in the glucose
utilization rate of white and brown adipose tissue with no effect on
skeletal muscle. In white adipocytes, mRNA expression of various fat
storage-promoting enzymes was markedly increased, whereas mRNA
expression of CPT1A (600528), which controls the rate-limiting step in
fat oxidation, was decreased. In brown adipocytes, central ghrelin
infusion resulted in lowered expression of the thermogenesis-related
mitochondrial UCP1 (113730) and UCP3 (602044). These ghrelin effects
were dose-dependent, occurred independently of ghrelin-induced
hyperphagia, and seemed to be mediated by the sympathetic nervous
system; none of the effects on adipocyte metabolism were observed
following peripheral administration of equal amounts of ghrelin.
Theander-Carrillo et al. (2006) concluded that central ghrelin is of
physiologic relevance in the control of cell metabolism in adipose
tissue.

Dixit et al. (2007) reported that ghrelin and ghrelin receptor
expression within the thymus diminished with progressive aging. Infusion
of ghrelin into 14-month-old mice significantly improved age-associated
changes in thymic architecture and thymocyte numbers, increasing recent
thymic emigrants and improving T cell receptor diversity of peripheral T
cell subsets. Ghrelin-induced thymopoiesis during aging was associated
with enhanced early thymocyte progenitors and bone marrow-derived
hematopoietic stem cells, while Ghrl/Ghsr-deficient mice displayed
accelerated age-associated thymic involution. Leptin (164160) also
enhanced thymopoiesis in aged but not young mice.

Jerlhag et al. (2009) provided evidence that the central ghrelin
signaling system is required for alcohol reward. In mice, central
ghrelin administration to brain ventricles, or to tegmental areas
involved in reward, increased voluntary alcohol intake. Central or
peripheral administration of ghrelin receptor antagonists suppressed
alcohol intake. In addition, suppression of central ghrelin signaling
resulted in blunting of alcohol-induced locomotor stimulation, decreased
dopamine release, and impaired conditioned place preference. These
findings indicated that central ghrelin signaling not only stimulates
the reward system, but is also required for stimulation of that system
by alcohol.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
OBESITY, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
METABOLIC SYNDROME, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, INCLUDED
GHRL, ARG51GLN

In 6 of 96 obese (601665) subjects, Ukkola et al. (2001) found a
substitution of gln for arg at codon 51 of preproghrelin (R51Q). This
mutation was caused by a G-to-A transition at codon 346 of the ghrelin
gene, leading to a replacement of arg by gln at the last codon of the
mature ghrelin product, codon 28. This mutation was not found among 96
control subjects. Hinney et al. (2002) found this mutation in similar
frequency among obese and control subjects, however.

In a study examining the relationship between GHRL variants and eating
behavior and risk for metabolic syndrome (see 605552), obesity,
diabetes, and related traits involving 856 Amish participants, Steinle
et al. (2005) found that the prevalence of metabolic syndrome was lower
among those carrying the 51Q allele (3.8 vs 15.8%; age- and sex-adjusted
odds ratio = 0.22; P = 0.031).

.0002
OBESITY, AGE AT ONSET OF
METABOLIC SYNDROME, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, INCLUDED
GHRL, LEU72MET

Ukkola et al. (2001) found this mutation, a nucleotide 408C-A
transversion resulting in a leu72-to-met (L72M) amino acid change, in 15
obese (601665) (12 heter- and 3 homozygotes) and 12 control subjects.
Among the obese carriers, 12 were heterozygous and 3 homozygous for the
substitution; among the control carriers, all were heterozygotes. This
mutation is outside the coding region for mature ghrelin. The age at
onset of self-reported weight problems tended to be lower among carrier
obese subjects than among those without the polymorphism.

Korbonits et al. (2002) found this SNP (dbSNP rs696217), which they
referred to as SNP247, in heterozygosity in 14 subjects. They noted that
children carrying this polymorphism had a significantly higher Z BMI
compared to those carrying only the wildtype allele, and that the age at
onset of obesity for those carrying this SNP was slightly earlier
(median SNP247 group 2.0 years, wildtype group 3.5 years; P = 0.036).

Hinney et al. (2002) identified this variant in both extremely obese
children and adolescents and normal-weight students.

In a study examining the relationship between GHRL variants and eating
behavior and risk for metabolic syndrome (see 605552), obesity,
diabetes, and related traits involving 856 Amish participants, Steinle
et al. (2005) found that the L72M variant was associated with increased
prevalence of metabolic syndrome (23.2 vs 13.4%; age- and sex-adjusted
odds ratio = 2.57; P = 0.02) as well as higher fasting glucose, lower
high density lipoprotein, and higher triglyceride levels (P = 0.02, P =
0.007, and P = 0.04, respectively).

.0003
OBESITY, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
GHRL, GLN90LEU

Hinney et al. (2002) identified a novel variant in the ghrelin gene, an
A-to-T transversion that led to a nonconservative amino acid change from
gln to leu at codon 90 (Q90L; dbSNP rs4684677). The frequency of the
leu90 allele was significantly higher in the extremely obese (601665)
children and adolescents than in the normal-weight students.
Additionally, they genotyped 134 underweight students and 44
normal-weight adults for this SNP. Genotype frequencies were similar in
extremely obese children and adolescents, underweight students, and
normal-weight adults.

.0004
GHRELIN POLYMORPHISM
GHRL, 2-BP DEL, CODON 34

In a healthy normal-weight individual, Hinney et al. (2002) identified a
2-bp deletion at codon 34 of ghrelin leading to the insertion of 36
aberrant amino acids and a stop codon at position 71. This variant
affects the coding region of mature ghrelin; presumably, this individual
is haploinsufficient for ghrelin.

605586	TITLE *605586 IMPORTIN 7; IPO7
;;RAN-BINDING PROTEIN 7; RANBP7
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The transport of protein and large RNAs through the nuclear pore
complexes (NPC) is an energy-dependent and regulated process. The import
of proteins with a nuclear localization signal (NLS) is accomplished by
recognition of one or more clusters of basic amino acids by the
importin-alpha/beta complex; see 600685 and 602738. The small GTPase RAN
(601179) plays a key role in NLS-dependent protein import. Gorlich et
al. (1997) purified a human Ran-binding protein, which they designated
RANBP7, from HeLa cell extract using a column with an immobilized
importin-beta-binding (IBB) domain. Both Xenopus and human RANBP7 bind
to the IBB domain of importin-alpha via importin-beta. Human RANBP7 is
approximately 95% identical to the Xenopus protein RanBP7. RANBP7
belongs to a Ran-binding protein superfamily whose members share with
importin-beta an N-terminal sequence motif that appears to account for
RanGTP binding.

GENE FUNCTION

Based on oocyte injection experiments, Gorlich et al. (1997) showed that
Xenopus RanBP7 is predominantly a cytoplasmic protein that shuttles
between nucleus and cytoplasm. Fluorescence labeling experiments
indicated that RanBP7 binds to NPC at the same site as importin-beta.
Although interaction between RanBP7 and importin-beta is unrelated to
NLS-mediated protein import, RanBP7 binds to RanGTP. RanGTP/RanBP7
binding prevents formation of the RanBP7/importin-beta complex and
dissolves preformed RanBP7/importin-beta complex. The authors
demonstrated that RanBP7 can form a trimeric complex with RanGTP and
RanBP1 (601180), and that RanBP7 inhibits GAP stimulation of the Ran
GTPase. Furthermore, RanBP7 requires nuclear RanGTP for export and is
exported as a complex with RanGTP.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the RANBP7
gene to chromosome 11 (TMAP WI-31060).

607472	TITLE *607472 MITOCHONDRIAL ESCAPE 1-LIKE 1; YME1L1
;;YME1L;;
YME1, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF, 1;;
PRESENILIN-ASSOCIATED METALLOPROTEASE; PAMP
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

YME1L1 shares significant homology with 3 members of the AAA superfamily
of metalloproteases from S. cerevisiae, Afg3 (see 603020), Rca1, and
Yme1. In yeast, these proteins are localized to the mitochondrial inner
membrane, where they perform roles in the assembly and turnover of
respiratory chain complexes.

CLONING

Using database analysis, conventional screening, and 5-prime RACE,
Coppola et al. (2000) cloned YME1L1 from a fetal brain cDNA library. The
deduced 716-amino acid protein contains an AAA consensus sequence, an
ATP/GTP-binding motif, and a zinc-dependent binding domain. YME1L1
shares 50% sequence identity with yeast Yme1, 40% identity with yeast
Rca1, and 39% identity with yeast Afg3, with highest homology in the
central regions of the proteins. Northern blot analysis revealed
transcripts of about 2.6 and 4.4 kb in all tissues examined, with
greatest abundance in adult heart, skeletal muscle, and pancreas. The
shorter transcript likely results from the use of an alternate
polyadenylation site. In situ hybridization of mouse embryos revealed
ubiquitous expression. YME1L1 overexpressed in COS-7 cells showed a
granular cytoplasmic localization, with higher density of puncta around
the nucleus, and colocalization with a mitochondrial marker.

Using the C termini of presenilin-1 (PSEN1; 104311) and presenilin-2
(PSEN2; 600759) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a brain cDNA
library, followed by screening a liver cDNA library, Pellegrini et al.
(2001) cloned YME1L1, which they designated PAMP. Northern blot analysis
detected 2 PAMP transcripts with different 3-prime untranslated regions.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a yeast strain in which the Yme1 gene was disrupted, Shah et al.
(2000) found that transfection and expression of YME1L1 restored growth
under conditions that were lethal to the Yme1-disrupted cells. Shah et
al. (2000) concluded that YME1L1 plays a phylogenetically conserved role
in mitochondrial protein metabolism.

GENE STRUCTURE

Coppola et al. (2000) determined that the YME1L1 gene contains 19 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Coppola et al. (2000) mapped the YME1L1
gene to chromosome 10q14. However, Gross (2008) mapped the YME1L1 gene
to chromosome 10p12.1 based on an alignment of the YME1L1 sequence
(GenBank GENBANK AJ132637) with the genomic sequence (build 36.3).

164762	TITLE *164762 V-CRK AVIAN SARCOMA VIRUS CT10 ONCOGENE HOMOLOG; CRK
;;ONCOGENE CRK;;
CRKII
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The CRK oncogene was originally identified as a transforming component
of the avian sarcoma virus CT10. A cDNA encoding the chicken cellular
homolog of v-crk was isolated by Reichman et al. (1992) and shown to
consist primarily of the SRC (190090) homology domains SH2 and SH3.
Matsuda et al. (1992) isolated 2 distinct human CRK cDNA species and
showed that the deduced amino acid sequences of the corresponding
polypeptides differed in their C termini. The 2 cDNA species were
considered to derive from the same genomic locus by alternative
splicing.

MAPPING

Fioretos et al. (1993) used fluorescence in situ hybridization to map
the CRK gene to chromosome 17p13. Deletion of this region of chromosome
17 is one of the most frequent chromosomal abnormalities in human
cancer. The TP53 gene (191170) maps to 17p13.1; Fioretos et al. (1993)
mapped the CRK oncogene to 17p13.3, which is a second region on 17p that
has been shown to manifest frequent loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in a
number of different tumor types. Thus, the region is presumed to harbor
a tumor suppressor gene.

GENE FUNCTION

Feller et al. (1994) described the SRC homology domains SH2 and SH3 as
molecular adhesives on many proteins involved in signal transduction.
They reviewed the interactions of ABL (189980) and CRK as a model of SH2
and SH3 interaction.

Hallock et al. (2010) found that Crk and Crkl (602007) were recruited to
mouse skeletal muscle synapses and played redundant roles in synaptic
differentiation. Crk and Crkl bound the same tyrosine-phosphorylated
sequences in Dok7 (610285), a protein that functions downstream of agrin
(AGRN; 103320) and muscle-specific receptor kinase (MUSK; 601296) in
synapse formation.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Cardoso et al. (2003) completed a physical and transcriptional map of
the 17p13.3 region from LIS1 to the telomere. Using Cardoso et al.
(2003), they mapped the deletion size in 19 children with ILS (607432),
11 children with Miller-Dieker syndrome (MDS; 164762), and 4 children
with 17p13.3 deletions not involving LIS1. They showed that the critical
region that differentiates ILS from MDS at the molecular level can be
reduced to 400 kb. Using somatic cell hybrids from selected patients,
the authors identified 8 genes that are consistently deleted in patients
classified as having MDS. These genes include ABR (600365),
14-3-3-epsilon (605066), CRK, MYO1C (606538), SKIP (603055), PITPNA
(600174), SCARF1, RILP, PRP8 (607300), and SERPINF1 (172860). In
addition, deletion of the genes CRK and 14-3-3-epsilon delineates
patients with the most severe lissencephaly grade. On the basis of
recent functional data and the creation of a mouse model suggesting a
role for 14-3-3-epsilon in cortical development, Cardoso et al. (2003)
suggested that deletion of 1 or both of these genes in combination with
deletion of LIS1 may contribute to the more severe form of lissencephaly
seen only in patients with MDS.

ANIMAL MODEL

Hallock et al. (2010) found that knockout of both Crk and Crkl in mouse
skeletal muscle, but not of either gene alone, caused perinatal
lethality. Lungs from Crk- and Crkl-deficient newborns failed to expand.
Embryonic day-18.5 muscle from Crk- and Crkl-deficient mice lacked
innervation and showed severe defects in presynaptic and postsynaptic
differentiation.

CLONING

Hovanessian et al. (1987) found that interferon-treated human cells
contain several OASs corresponding to proteins of 40 (OAS1), 46 (OAS1),
69 (OAS2), and 100 (OAS3; 603351) kD. Marie et al. (1989) generated
highly specific polyclonal antibodies against p69, the 69-kD OAS. By
screening an interferon-treated human cell expression library with the
anti-p69 antibodies, Marie and Hovanessian (1992) isolated a partial
OAS2 cDNA. They screened additional libraries with the partial cDNA and
recovered cDNAs encoding 2 OAS2 isoforms. The smaller isoform is encoded
by 2 mRNAs that differ in the length of the 3-prime untranslated region.
Northern blot analysis revealed that OAS2 is expressed as 4
interferon-induced mRNAs in human cells. The predicted OAS2 proteins
have a common 683-amino acid sequence and different 3-prime termini. By
SDS-PAGE of in vitro transcription/translation products, the authors
showed that 2 isoforms have molecular masses of 69 and 71 kD. Sequence
analysis indicated that OAS2 contains 2 OAS1-homologous domains
separated by a proline-rich putative linker region. The N- and
C-terminal domains are 41% and 53% identical to OAS1, respectively.
Marie and Hovanessian (1992) suggested that the OAS2 gene derived from
the fusion of 2 ancestral genes analogous to OAS1.

GENE FUNCTION

Marie and Hovanessian (1992) found that both isoforms of human OAS2
exhibited OAS activity in vitro.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization and by inclusion within mapped
clones, Hovnanian et al. (1998) determined that the OAS1, OAS2, and OAS3
genes are clustered with a 130-kb region on chromosome 12q24.2.

600727	TITLE *600727 NUCLEAR FACTOR I/A; NFIA
;;TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR NFIA;;
KIAA1439
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Nuclear factor I (NFI) proteins, such as NFIA, constitute a family of
dimeric DNA-binding proteins with similar, and possibly identical,
DNA-binding specificity. They function as cellular transcription factors
and as replication factors for adenovirus DNA replication. Diversity in
this protein family is generated by multiple genes, differential
splicing, and heterodimerization (summary by Qian et al., 1995).

CLONING

Qian et al. (1995) isolated partial cDNA sequences derived from 4
independent genes: NFIA, NFIB (600728), NFIC (600729), and NFIX
(164005).

By sequencing clones obtained from an adult brain cDNA library, Nagase
et al. (2000) cloned NFIA, which they designated KIAA1439. The deduced
protein contains 561 amino acids and shares complete sequence identity
with rat nuclear factor-1 over 509 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA detected
moderate to high expression in all tissues examined. Highest expression
was detected in heart and liver, followed by brain, lung, ovary,
skeletal muscle, kidney, testis, fetal liver, fetal brain, pancreas, and
spleen. NFIA was expressed at moderate to high levels in all adult brain
regions tested, with highest expression in cerebellum and caudate
nucleus.

GENE STRUCTURE

Grunder et al. (2003) determined that the NFIA gene contains 11 exons.
By ortholog comparisons using protein sequences from 7 vertebrate
species, they identified 12 NFIA variants that are produced by
alternative splicing.

MAPPING

By FISH, Qian et al. (1995) mapped the NFIA and NFIB genes to
chromosomes 1p31.3-p31.2 and 9p24.1, respectively. They localized the
NFIC and NFIX genes to chromosome 19p13.3 in the order
cen--NFIX--NFIC--tel. Comparison of the position of NFI genes and JUN
genes (see JUNB, 165161) revealed a close physical linkage between
members of the NFI and JUN gene families in the human genome.

By FISH, Grunder et al. (2003) mapped the mouse Nfia and Nfib genes to
chromosome 4C4-C6.

GENE FUNCTION

Deneen et al. (2006) found that Nfia and Nfib were induced in the spinal
cord ventricular zone of mouse embryos concomitant with induction of
Glast (SLC1A3; 600111), a marker of gliogenesis. Using mouse and chicken
embryos and embryonic rat cortical progenitor cells, they showed that
Nfia and Nfib were necessary and sufficient to promote glial cell fate
specification. At later embryonic stages, Nfia and Nfib promoted
terminal astrocyte differentiation. Nfia also inhibited neurogenesis in
ventricular zone progenitors.

Rosa et al. (2007) identified a pathway by which PU.1 (SPI1; 165170)
regulated human monocyte/macrophage differentiation. PU.1 activated
transcription of MIR424 (300682), which translationally repressed NFIA,
resulting in activation of differentiation-specific genes, such as MCSFR
(CSF1R; 164770).

regulated human monocyte/macrophage differentiation. PU.1 activated
transcription of MIR424 (300682), which translationally repressed NFIA,
resulting in activation of differentiation-specific genes, such as MCSFR
(CSF1R; 164770).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Lu et al. (2007) reported 5 patients, including 2 half sibs, with
balanced translocations or interstitial deletions of chromosome 1q31-q32
(613735) involving the NFIA gene confirmed by FISH and Southern blot
analysis. Three of the patients had been previously reported by Campbell
et al. (2002) and Shanske et al. (2004). The 2 half sibs had a 12-Mb
deletion involving approximately 47 additional genes, and another
patient had a 12-Mb deletion of chromosome 2q encompassing 39 additional
genes, as well as a translocation involving chromosome 1p. The remaining
2 patients had a translocation with a microdeletion and a translocation,
respectively. All 5 showed a similar phenotype characterized by
hypoplastic or absent corpus callosum, hydrocephalus or
ventriculomegaly, and developmental delay. Four patients had a tethered
spinal cord, 3 had Chiari type I malformation, and 3 had seizures. In
addition, 3 patients had urinary tract defects, including vesicoureteral
reflux and urinary incontinence. Although all 5 cases had
haploinsufficiency of NFIA, each case also had involvement of 1 or more
additional genes, which may have contributed to the phenotype.
Intragenic mutations in the NFIA gene were not identified in any of the
patients or in 219 additional patients with various neurologic
developmental abnormalities. Lu et al. (2007) noted the phenotypic
similarities to Nfia loss of function in the mouse and suggested that
haploinsufficiency of the NFIA gene contributed to the malformation
syndrome in these patients.

ANIMAL MODEL

Das Neves et al. (1999) found that disruption of the mouse Nfia gene
caused perinatal lethality. More than 95% of Nfia null animals died
within 2 weeks after birth. Newborn animals lacked a corpus callosum and
showed ventricular dilation indicating early hydrocephalus. Rare
surviving homozygous mice lacked a corpus callosum, showed severe
communicating hydrocephalus, a full-axial tremor indicative of
neurologic defects, male sterility, and low female fertility, but they
had near normal life spans.

601966	TITLE *601966 REGULATORY SOLUTE CARRIER PROTEIN, FAMILY 1, MEMBER 1; RSC1A1
;;RS1
DESCRIPTION D-glucose is absorbed in the small intestine and kidney by
sodium-coupled transport. SGLT1 (182380), SAAT1, and Hu14 are homologous
integral membrane proteins that mediate sodium-driven transport of
D-glucose. A cDNA, pRS1, encoding a membrane-associated protein that
alters sugar transport by SGLT1, was cloned from pig kidney cortex.
Lambotte et al. (1996) cloned the intronless human homolog, termed RS1
by them, encoding a 617-amino acid protein with 74% amino acid identity
to pRS1. By fluorescence in situ hybridization, the RS1 gene was
localized to chromosome 1p36.1. Coexpression of hRS1 and SGLT1 from
human intestine in oocytes showed that hRS1 protein inhibits
sodium-D-glucose cotransporter expressed by human SGLT1 by decreasing
both the V (max) and the apparent K(m) value of the transporter.

610745	TITLE *610745 STIMULATED BY RETINOIC ACID 6; STRA6
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Bouillet et al. (1997) cloned mouse Stra6. The deduced 670-amino acid
protein has 9 potential transmembrane domains. RT-PCR detected highest
Stra6 expression in brain, kidney, spleen, testis, and female genital
tract, and much lower expression in heart, lung, and liver.
Immunohistochemical analysis and in situ hybridization of embryonic and
adult mice showed that Stra6 was broadly expressed in a cell
type-specific manner. In adult mice, Stra6 was strongly expressed at
blood-organ barriers. In vitro translation resulted in a protein with an
apparent molecular mass of 74 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

Using differential subtractive hybridization, Bouillet et al. (1997)
found that expression of Stra6 was upregulated in mouse embryonal
carcinoma cells following treatment with retinoic acid. RT-PCR showed
that Stra6 transcripts accumulated in a time- and retinoic acid
concentration-dependent manner. In mouse Sertoli cells, Stra6 was
expressed in a spermatogenic cell cycle-dependent manner. However, in
testes of retinoic acid receptor-alpha (RARA; 180240)-null mice, Stra6
was abnormally expressed in all tubules.

Kawaguchi et al. (2007) identified STRA6 as the membrane receptor for
retinol binding protein (RBP1; 180260), which mediates cellular uptake
of vitamin A.

GENE STRUCTURE

Bouillet et al. (1997) determined that the mouse Stra6 gene contains 19
exons.

Pasutto et al. (2007) determined that the human STRA6 gene contains 20
exons.

MAPPING

Gross (2013) mapped the STRA6 gene to chromosome 15q24.1 based on an
alignment of the STRA6 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF370419) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Pasutto et al. (2007) observed 2 unrelated consanguineous families with
malformation syndromes sharing clinical anophthalmia and distinct
eyebrows as common signs, but differing for alveolar capillary dysplasia
or complex congenital heart defect in one and diaphragmatic hernia in
the other family (MCOPS9; 601186). Homozygosity mapping revealed linkage
to a common locus on chromosome 15, and pathogenic homozygous mutations
were identified in STRA6, a member of a large group of 'stimulated by
retinoic acid' genes encoding novel transmembrane proteins,
transcription factors, and secreted signaling molecules or proteins.
Subsequently, Pasutto et al. (2007) demonstrated homozygous STRA6
mutations in 3 of 13 patients chosen on the basis of significant
phenotypic overlap to the original cases. A homozygous deletion
generating a premature stop codon (G50AfsX22; 610745.0002) led to
absence of the immunoreactive protein in the patient's fibroblast
culture. Structural analysis of 3 missense mutations (P90L, 610745.0005;
P293L, 610745.0001; and T321P, 610745.0005) suggested significant
effects on the geometry of the loop connecting the transmembrane helices
of STRA6. Two further variations in the C terminus (T644M, 610745.0004
and R655C, 610745.0003) altered specific functional sites, an
SH2-binding motif and a phosphorylation site, respectively. STRA6
mutations thus define a pleiotropic malformation syndrome representing
the first human phenotype associated with mutations in a gene from the
STRA group.

Retinoic acid is a potent teratogen in all vertebrates when tight
homeostatic controls on its endogenous dose, location, or timing are
perturbed during early embryogenesis. STRA6 encodes an integral cell
membrane protein that favors retinoic acid uptake from soluble
retinol-binding protein; its transcription is directly regulated by
levels of retinoic acid. Golzio et al. (2007) performed molecular
analysis of the STRA6 gene in 2 families with Matthew-Wood syndrome
(MCOPS9; 601186). One of the fetuses had a homozygous insertion/deletion
in exon 2 and the other had a homozygous insertion in exon 7. Both
predicted a premature stop codon in STRA6 transcripts.

Using DNA extracted from a paraffin block of autopsy tissue from a male
infant with clinical anophthalmia and diaphragmatic eventration, who was
originally reported by Steiner et al. (2002), West et al. (2009)
identified compound heterozygosity for a 2-bp insertion and a nonsense
mutation, both in exon 2 of the STRA6 gene (610745.0009 and
610745.0010).

Segel et al. (2009) reported a 2.5-year-old girl with clinical
anophthalmia, bushy eyebrows, patent ductus arteriosus, and normal
cognitive development who was compound heterozygous for 2 missense
mutations in the STRA6 gene (610745.0012 and 610745.0013). The authors
suggested that clinical anophthalmia is the major phenotypic effect of
STRA6 mutations and that it may be compatible with normal psychomotor
development.

In a large consanguineous Irish Traveller family with isolated
microphthalmia and coloboma (MCOPCB8; see 601186), Casey et al. (2011)
identified homozygosity for a missense mutation in the STRA6 gene
(G304K; 610745.0011). Homozygosity for the same G304K mutation was
identified in 2 more Irish Traveller probands, 1 with microphthalmia and
dysplastic right kidney, and 1 who fulfilled the criteria for
Matthew-Wood syndrome (MCOPS9). Functional analysis showed that G304K
mutant STRA6 is mislocalized and has severely reduced vitamin A uptake
activity.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using a retinoic acid (RA) synthesis inhibitor in zebrafish embryos,
Casey et al. (2011) modeled different levels of RA and observed
dose-dependent microphthalmia. The inhibitor produced developmental eye
defects ranging from mild to severe microphthalmia as well as retinal
pigment epithelium coloboma, also in a range of severity. Other
developmental defects were visible, including defects in heart
morphogenesis, consistent with the role of RA in multiple developmental
processes.

In 2 affected female infants of a consanguineous Turkish family who had
bilateral clinical anophthalmia and variable pulmonary and cardiac
defects (MCOPS9; 601186), Pasutto et al. (2007) identified homozygosity
for an 878C-T transition in exon 12 of the STRA6 gene that resulted in a
pro293-to-leu (P293L) substitution. One infant died at 6 months of age

ventricular septal defects, severe short stature, and profound mental
retardation (MCOPS9; 601186), Pasutto et al. (2007) identified
homozygosity for a 1-bp insertion in exon 4 of the STRA6 gene
(145-147delC) that resulted in frameshift and premature termination of
the protein product (G50AfsX22).

who died at 3 months of age, Pasutto et al. (2007) identified a
homozygous missense mutation, arg655 to cys (R655C), caused by a 1963C-T
transition in exon 20 of the STRA6 gene. The parents were distantly
related. An older brother, who had bilateral clinical anophthalmia,
truncus arteriosus communis with right aortic arch, pulmonary artery
atresia, and patent ductus arteriosus, died at age 22 months due to
thrombosis of the bronchial arterial branches. This child could feed
himself and speak in short sentences and thus showed no evidence of
mental retardation.

1931C-T transition in exon 20 of the STRA6 gene, resulting in a
thr644-to-met (T644M) substitution. The unaffected parents were not
known to be related. An earlier male sib had died at 24 hours of age
with pulmonary hypoplasia and unilobar left lung, tetralogy of Fallot,
patent ductus arteriosus, undescended testes, horseshoe kidney, and
hypoplastic renal arteries; an earlier female sib died within 24 hours

missense mutations in the STRA6 gene. One was a 269C-T transition in
exon 6 that gave rise to a pro90-to-leu (P90L) substitution; the other,
a 961A-C transversion in exon 13, caused a thr321-to-pro (T321P)

(2007) found homozygosity for an insertion/deletion in exon 2 of the
STRA6 gene (52_52delACTinsCC) that resulted in frameshift and premature
termination of the protein (asp17alafsX55). An older brother with
isolated coloboma of the retina and iris was heterozygous for the
mutation, as were the clinically unaffected parents. Intrauterine death
in the proband occurred at 31 weeks' gestation. The anatomic findings
included bilateral anophthalmia, bilateral agenesis of the lungs,
bilateral eventration of the diaphragm, bilateral absence of pulmonary
artery branches, duodenal stenosis, and annular pancreas.

homozygous insertion of a single basepair in exon 7 of the STRA6 gene,
527_528insG that predicted a premature stop codon (gly176glyfsX59).
Clinical features included bilateral anophthalmia, bilateral agenesis of
the lungs, bilateral eventration of the diaphragm, pulmonary trunk and
pulmonary artery absence, ventricular septal defect, duodenal stenosis,
and absent pancreas. Intrauterine death occurred at 28 weeks' gestation.

Analyzing DNA extracted from a paraffin block of autopsy tissue from a
male infant with clinical anophthalmia and diaphragmatic eventration
(MCOPS9; 601186), who was originally reported by Steiner et al. (2002),
West et al. (2009) identified compound heterozygosity for a 2-bp
insertion (277insCC) in exon 2 of the STRA6 gene, predicted to cause a
frameshift and premature stop codon, and a 310G-A transition, also in
exon 2, predicted to result in a trp23-to-ter (W23X) substitution
(610745.0010). The patient was hypotonic at birth, with respiratory
distress requiring ventilator support. Multiple anomalies included flat
face with bitemporal narrowing, bilateral clinical anophthalmia, short
palpebral fissures, mildly prominent nose with anteverted nares, long
philtrum, small jaw, full cheeks, high and arched palate, bilateral
diaphragmatic eventration, cryptorchidism, and bilateral inguinal
hernia. After staged repair of the diaphragm, respiratory distress
worsened and support was withdrawn. At autopsy, the orbits lacked globes
and contained fibroadipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and retinal
rudiments. Other findings included small optic nerves, thin corpus
callosum, ostium primum and fossa ovalis atrial septal defects, severe
right ventricular hypertrophy, and incomplete lobation of the lungs. The
patient had a twin sib who was normal.

STRA6, GLY304LYS

In affected members of a large consanguineous Irish Traveller family
with isolated microphthalmia and coloboma (MCOPCB8; see 601186), Casey
et al. (2011) identified homozygosity for a 910GG-AA transition in the
STRA6 gene, resulting in a gly304-to-lys (G304K) substitution at a
highly conserved residue in the initial segment of the sixth
transmembrane domain. The mutation was not found in unaffected family
members or in 50 ethnically matched Irish Traveller controls.
Homozygosity for the G304K mutation was also found in 2 more Irish
Traveller probands, a boy with bilateral clinical anophthalmia and a
dysplastic right kidney, and a girl who fulfilled the criteria for
Matthew-Wood syndrome (MCOPS9; 601186). Haplotype analysis supported a
common ancestral origin for the disease mutation in all 3 families.
Transfection studies in COS1 cells demonstrated that the G304K mutation
almost completely abolished vitamin A uptake activity compared to
wildtype. Live-cell staining showed that the G304K mutation led to loss
of cell surface expression of STRA6; permeabilized immunostaining
demonstrated that the G304K mutant was still expressed, suggesting that
the mutation either causes misfolding of STRA6 or interferes with its
targeting mechanism to prevent cell surface expression. Casey et al.
(2011) suggested that the intrafamilial phenotypic heterogeneity might
be attributed to variability in vitamin A intake and/or uptake by RBP
(180260)/STRA6-independent mechanisms.

STRA6, ASP560HIS

In a 2.5-year-old girl with clinical anophthalmia, bushy eyebrows,
patent ductus arteriosus, and normal motor and cognitive development
(MCOPS9; 601186), Segel et al. (2009) identified compound heterozygosity
for 2 missense mutations in the STRA6 gene: a 1678G-C transversion in
exon 17, resulting in an asp560-to-his (D560H) substitution, and a
1964G-A transition in exon 19, resulting in an arg655-to-his (R655H;
610745.0013) substitution. The healthy parents were each heterozygous
for 1 of the mutations, neither of which was found in 190 controls.

142461	TITLE *142461 HEPARAN SULFATE PROTEOGLYCAN OF BASEMENT MEMBRANE; HSPG2
;;PERLECAN; PLC
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Heparan sulfate proteoglycan is a major component of basement membranes,
where the molecule may be involved in the stabilization of other
molecules as well as being involved with glomerular permeability to
macromolecules and cell adhesion. This form of HSPG, known as HSPG2 or
perlecan, is encoded by a gene that maps to chromosome 1. The gene for
the form of HSPG associated with the cell surface of fibroblasts has
been mapped to human chromosome 8 (142460).

CLONING

Wintle et al. (1990) isolated 2 partial cDNA clones encoding different
domains of the core protein of mouse HSPG. Southern blot analysis
suggested that the gene is in single copy in the mouse; presumably, the
same is true for the human. Dodge et al. (1991) studied 2 overlapping
cDNA clones of HSPG2 from a human colon library. The deduced amino acid
sequence showed an identity of 87% between human and mouse. Cohen et al.
(1993) stated that perlecan is an approximately 467-kD protein comprised
of 5 domains, of which only the first, the heparan sulfate-binding
region, is unique. The other 4 domains are homologous to the LDL
receptor, the N-terminal region of laminin A and B short arms (see
600133), NCAM (116930), and the globular C terminus of the laminin A
chain, respectively.

GENE FUNCTION

Iozzo et al. (1997) found that perlecan transcription is upregulated by
TGF-beta (190180).

Perlecan, a ubiquitous heparan sulfate proteoglycan, possesses
angiogenic and growth-promoting attributes primarily by acting as a
coreceptor for basic fibroblast growth factor, FGF2 (134920). Sharma et
al. (1998) blocked perlecan expression by using either constitutive
CMV-driven or doxycycline-inducible antisense constructs. Growth of
colon carcinoma cells was markedly attenuated upon obliteration of
perlecan gene expression and these effects correlated with reduced
responsiveness to and affinity for mitogenic keratinocyte growth factor,
FGF7 (148180). Exogenous perlecan effectively reconstituted the activity
of FGF7 in the perlecan-deficient cells. In both tumor xenografts
induced by human colon carcinoma cells and tumor allografts induced by
highly invasive mouse melanoma cells, perlecan suppression caused
substantial inhibition of tumor growth and neovascularization. Thus,
perlecan is a potent inducer of tumor growth and angiogenesis in vivo,
and therapeutic interventions targeting this key modulator of tumor
progression may improve cancer treatment.

By yeast 2-hybrid and coimmunoprecipitation analyses with domain III of
HSPG2 as bait, Mongiat et al. (2001) showed that keratinocyte FGFBP1
(607737) interacts with HSPG2. Deletion analysis determined that FGFBP1
binds to the second EGF motif of domain III, close to the binding site
for FGF7. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated colocalization of
FGFBP1 with HSPG2 in the pericellular stroma of squamous cell
carcinomas.

GENE STRUCTURE

Cohen et al. (1993) reported that the HSPG2 gene is composed of 94 exons
spanning at least 120 kb, and that there appear to be multiple
transcription start sites.

Iozzo et al. (1997) characterized the promoter region of HSPG2.

Nicole et al. (2000) found that the HSPG2 gene contains 97 exons.

MAPPING

Using a mouse cDNA clone for in situ hybridization, Wintle et al. (1990)
assigned the HSPG2 gene to human chromosome 1p36.1. Dodge et al. (1991)
demonstrated by Southern blot analyses of DNA from human/rodent somatic
cell hybrids, including subclones with specific translocations or
spontaneous breaks of human chromosome 1, that the HSPG2 gene lies on
the telomeric part of 1p. By a combination of somatic cell hybrid
analysis and in situ hybridization, Kallunki et al. (1991) assigned the
HSPG2 gene to 1p36.1-p35. Chakravarti et al. (1991) mapped the gene to
mouse chromosome 4 by segregation analysis of restriction fragment
length variants (RFLVs) in recombinant inbred strains of mice. They
referred to the gene as perlecan (Plc).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Schwartz-Jampel Syndrome Type 1

Schwartz-Jampel syndrome type 1 (SJS1; 255800) is a rare autosomal
recessive disorder characterized by permanent myotonia and skeletal
dysplasia, resulting in reduced stature, kyphoscoliosis, bowing of the
diaphyses, and irregular epiphyses. In 3 families with SJS1, Nicole et
al. (2000) identified mutations in the HSPG2 gene (see, e.g.,
142461.0001; 142461.0002). The findings underscored the importance of
perlecan not only in maintaining cartilage integrity but also in
regulating muscle excitability. Perlecan is present in endomysium, the
connective tissue sheath surrounding individual skeletal muscle fibers,
whereas most myotonic disorders arise from mutations in genes encoding
voltage-gated ion channels. A possible explanation for muscle
hyperexcitability with perlecan mutations could involve the modulation
of ion-channel expression or function through their interaction with
perlecan.

Arikawa-Hirasawa et al. (2002) identified 5 different mutations in the
perlecan gene in 3 unrelated patients with Schwartz-Jampel syndrome
(142461.0006-142461.0010). Heterozygous mutations in 2 patients with SJS
(who were genetically compound heterozygotes) either produced truncated
perlecan that lacked domain V or resulted in significantly reduced
levels of wildtype perlecan. A third patient was homozygous for a 7-bp
deletion that resulted in reduced amounts of nearly full-length
perlecan. The SJS mutations resulted in reduced levels of different
forms of perlecan that were secreted to the extracellular matrix and
were likely partially functional. These findings suggested that perlecan
has an important role in neuromuscular function and cartilage formation.

Stum et al. (2006) identified 25 different HSPG2 mutations, including 22
novel mutations, distributed throughout the gene among 35 patients from
23 families with SJS1. Analysis of HSPG2 mRNA and perlecan
immunostaining in patients' fibroblasts showed a hypomorphic,
loss-of-function effect. Truncating mutations resulted in
nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, whereas missense mutations involving
cysteine residues led to intracellular retention of perlecan. No founder
mutations were identified and no genotype/phenotype correlations were
observed.

- Dyssegmental Dysplasia, Silverman-Handmaker Type

In patients with the Silverman-Handmaker type of dyssegmental dysplasia
(DDSH; 224410), Arikawa-Hirasawa et al. (2001) found homozygous
duplication and heterozygous point mutations in the HSPG2 gene
(142461.0003-142461.0005), all predicted to cause a frameshift,
resulting in a truncated protein core. Truncated perlecan was not
secreted by patient fibroblasts, but was degraded to smaller fragments
within the cells.

ANIMAL MODEL

Arikawa-Hirasawa et al. (1999) disrupted the Hspg2 gene in mice.
Approximately 40% of Hspg2 -/- mice died at embryonic day 10.5 with
defective cephalic development. The remaining Hspg2 -/- mice died just
after birth with skeletal dysplasia characterized by micromelia with
broad and bowed long bones, narrow thorax, and craniofacial
abnormalities. only 6% of Hspg2 -/- mice developed both exencephaly and
chondrodysplasia. Hspg2 -/- cartilage showed severe disorganization of
the columnar structures of chondrocytes and defective endochondral
ossification. Hspg2 -/- cartilage matrix contained reduced and
disorganized collagen fibrils and glycosaminoglycans, suggesting that
perlecan has an important role in matrix structure. In Hspg2 -/-
cartilage, proliferation of chondrocytes was reduced and the
prehypertrophic zone was diminished. The abnormal phenotypes of the
Hspg2 -/- skeleton are similar to those of thanatophoric dysplasia type
1 (see 187600), which is caused by activating mutations in FGFR3
(134934), and to those of FGFR3 gain-of-function mice. Arikawa-Hirasawa
et al. (1999) concluded that these molecules affect similar signaling
pathways.

Rodgers et al. (2007) generated 2 strains of knock-in mice: those
carrying the C1532Y mutation (142461.0002) alone and those carrying the
C1532Y mutation and the neomycin cassette (C1532Yneo). Analysis of
C1532Yneo mice revealed Hspg2 transcriptional changes, leading to
reduced perlecan secretion and a skeletal phenotype reminiscent of
Schwartz-Jampel syndrome (SJS; 255800) with features including smaller
size, impaired mineralization, misshapen bones, flat face, and
osteoarthritis- and osteonecrosis-like joint dysplasias. C1532Yneo mice
also displayed transient expansion of hypertrophic cartilage in the
growth plate, concomitant with radial trabecular bone orientation. In
contrast, the mice carrying only the C1532Y mutation displayed a mild
phenotype inconsistent with SJS. Rodgers et al. (2007) questioned the
C1532Y mutation as the sole causative factor for SJS in the Turkish
family harboring this variant (Nicole et al., 2000), and suggested that
transcriptional changes leading to perlecan reduction might represent
the disease mechanism for SJS.

Stum et al. (2008) performed a similar study of 2 mouse strains, 1 with
the homozygous C1532Y mutation and 1 with the mutation attached to a
neomycin cassette (C1532Yneo), to test a dosage effect of the mutation.
Skeletal muscle sections from both mouse strains showed a reduced
extracellular network, more severe in the C1532Yneo mice, as well as
intracellular accumulation of the mutant protein. Both strains had
reduced body weight, more apparent in the C1532Yneo mice, and C1532Yneo
mutant mice developed chondrodysplasia and hip dysplasia. Both strains
also developed a progressive neuromuscular phenotype from age 2 months,
with delayed opening of the eyelids and stiffening of the hindlimbs when
suspended by the tail. However, the phenotype was more severe in the
C1532Yneo mice, who also showed spontaneous muscle activity on
electromyography (EMG). The difference in phenotype was consistent with
a dosage effect, with an inverse correlation between severity and amount
of perlecan secreted into the basement membrane. Skeletal muscle biopsy
of C1532Yneo mice showed variability in fiber size and centralized
nuclei, but no evidence of acute muscle degeneration/regeneration. The
muscles of C1532Y mutant mice were not affected. Skeletal muscle samples
from both mouse strains showed a specific loss of collagen-tailed
acetylcholinesterase (AChE) (COLQ; 603033), more severe in C1532Yneo
mice, and apparently due to a decrease in the amount of perlecan at the
neuromuscular junction. EMG studies of the limb muscles indicated that
the endplate AChE deficiency resulted in the potentiation of muscle
force, with a prolonged decay time of endplate potentials. However,
physiologic endplate AChE deficiency was not associated with spontaneous
activity at rest in the diaphragm, suggesting that additional changes
are necessary to cause this activity.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
SCHWARTZ-JAMPEL SYNDROME, TYPE 1
HSPG2, IVS64DS, A-G, +4

In affected members of a Tunisian family with Schwartz-Jampel syndrome
(255800), Nicole et al. (2000) identified a homozygous A-to-G transition
at position +4 of the intron 64 splice donor site of the HSPG2 gene. The
resulting loss of exon 64 in the mRNA introduced a frameshift and a
subsequent premature stop codon, predicted to result in a truncated
protein lacking 1,595 amino acids.

.0002
SCHWARTZ-JAMPEL SYNDROME, TYPE 1
HSPG2, CYS1532TYR

In a Turkish family with Schwartz-Jampel syndrome (255800), Nicole et
al. (2000) identified a G-to-A transition at nucleotide 4595 of the
HSPG2 gene, resulting in a cys1532-to-tyr substitution.

Rodgers et al. (2007) analyzed the C1532Y mutation in 2 strains of
knock-in mice: those carrying the C1532Y mutation alone and those
carrying the mutation and the neomycin cassette (C1532Yneo). C1532Yneo
mice displayed a phenotype reminiscent of SJS syndrome, including
smaller size, impaired mineralization, misshapen bones, flat face, and
osteoarthritis- and osteonecrosis-like joint dysplasias, whereas the
mice carrying only the C1532Y mutation displayed a mild phenotype
inconsistent with SJS. Rodgers et al. (2007) questioned the C1532Y
mutation as the sole causative factor for SJS in the Turkish family
harboring the variant, and suggested that transcriptional changes
leading to perlecan reduction might represent the disease mechanism for
SJS.

.0003
DYSSEGMENTAL DYSPLASIA, SILVERMAN-HANDMAKER TYPE
HSPG2, 89-BP DUP, EX34

In a pair of sibs with the Silverman-Handmaker type of dyssegmental
dysplasia (224410), born to consanguineous parents of Sri Lankan origin,
Arikawa-Hirasawa et al. (2001) identified an 89-bp duplication in exon
34 of the HSPG2 gene in homozygosity. The cartilage matrix from these
patients stained poorly with antibody specific for perlecan, but there
was staining of intracellular inclusion bodies. Truncated perlecan was
not secreted by patient fibroblasts, but was degraded to smaller
fragments within the cells.

.0004
DYSSEGMENTAL DYSPLASIA, SILVERMAN-HANDMAKER TYPE
HSPG2, 7086G-A, +5

In a 22-week fetus diagnosed with the Silverman-Handmaker type of
dyssegmental dysplasia (DDSH; 224410), Arikawa-Hirasawa et al. (2001)
identified a G-to-A transition at the +5 position of intron 52 of the
HSPG2 gene (7086+5G-A), which resulted in skipping of exon 52 and a
premature termination codon in exon 53. The fetus manifested
exophthalmos, bilateral cataracts, pterygia, posterior encephalocele,
and microcephaly, with a crown-heel length of 18 cm and a crown-rump
length of 16 cm. The radiographs and chondroosseous morphology were
typical of DDSH. On the other allele, the patient had skipping of exon
73 and a premature termination codon in exon 75 (142461.0005).

.0005
DYSSEGMENTAL DYSPLASIA, SILVERMAN-HANDMAKER TYPE
HSPG2, 10328C-T

In a fetus with Silverman-Handmaker type of dyssegmental dysplasia
(224410), Arikawa-Hirasawa et al. (2001) identified a C-to-T transition
at residue 10,328 of exon 73 of the HSPG2 gene (10328C-T), which
resulted in skipping of exon 73 and a premature termination codon in
exon 75. The patient was a compound heterozygote for another splice site
mutation resulting in a premature termination codon (142461.0004).

.0006
SCHWARTZ-JAMPEL SYNDROME, TYPE 1
HSPG2, IVS56DS, A-G, +4

Arikawa-Hirasawa et al. (2002) found compound heterozygosity for 2 HSPG2
mutations in an 8-year-old boy with Schwartz-Jampel syndrome (255800).
At the age of 3 years, dysmorphic features were noted that became
gradually prominent and consisted of tonic contraction of the facial
muscles, micrognathia, low-set ears with folded helices, medial
displacement of the outer canthi, narrow palpebral fissures,
blepharophimosis, microstomia and pursing of the lips, high-arched
palate, cervical kyphosis, pes planus and valgus ankle formation, bowing
of the leg bones, kyphoscoliosis, and lumbar lordosis. He had
hypertrophic muscles and mild weakness of the quadriceps muscles. The
creatine kinase level was elevated and the EMG showed occasional
myotonic discharges. One allele in the patient had an A-to-G transition
at +4 position (donor site) of intron 56 of the HSPG2 gene (7374+4A-G)
that resulted in skipping of exon 56. The other allele contained a
fusion of exons 60 and 61 that resulted in retention of intron 59 or
intron 61 or in retention of both in the mutant transcripts
(142461.0007).

.0007
SCHWARTZ-JAMPEL SYNDROME, TYPE 1
HSPG2, EX60/61 FUS

In an 8-year-old boy with Schwartz-Jampel syndrome (255800),
Arikawa-Hirasawa et al. (2002) found compound heterozygosity for a
splice site mutation (142461.0006) and, on the second allele, a fusion
of exons 60 and 61 that resulted in retention of intron 59 or intron 61
or in retention of both in the mutant transcripts. The exon fusion
occurred at the precise acceptor and donor sites, probably by
retrotransposition. The exon fusion mutation created aberrant
transcripts. The production of wildtype transcript was also predicted
and confirmed.

.0008
SCHWARTZ-JAMPEL SYNDROME, TYPE 1
HSPG2, 8544G-A

Arikawa-Hirasawa et al. (2002) found compound heterozygosity for 2
different mutations in the HSPG2 gene in a male with Schwartz-Jampel
syndrome (255800). Short stature and micromelia had been noted at the
age of 4 months. Radiographs showed squared, flared ilia and short,
bowed long bones. At 3 years of age, he showed thigh muscle hypertrophy
and gastrocnemius muscle atrophy. Micrognathia, pursed lips, saddle
nose, orbital hypertelorism, low-set ears, and high-arched palate were
noted. He showed a waddling gait, mild weakness of the quadriceps
muscles, and percussion myotonia. EMG showed myotonic and myopathic
discharges. He was found to have a G-to-A transition at the last
nucleotide of exon 64 (8544G-A) in allele 1. This transition mutation
did not change an amino acid but resulted in skipping of exon 64. The
second allele carried a 9-bp deletion at the acceptor junction of intron
66 and exon 67 that created abnormal splicing, including total or
partial retention of intron 66 or skipping of exon 67 (142461.0009). All
aberrant splicing products were predicted to create premature
termination codons.

SCHWARTZ-JAMPEL SYNDROME, TYPE 1
HSPG2, 9-BP DEL

See 142461.0008 and Arikawa-Hirasawa et al. (2002).

.0010
SCHWARTZ-JAMPEL SYNDROME, TYPE 1
HSPG2, 7,108-BP DEL

Arikawa-Hirasawa et al. (2002) identified a 7-kb homozygous deletion in
the HSPG2 gene in a patient who had been reported as having micromelic
chondrodysplasia by Stevenson (1982) but was reclassified as having
Schwartz-Jampel syndrome (255800) by Spranger et al. (2000).
Micrognathia, prominent philtrum, and bowed long bones were noted at age
3 months. Radiographs showed coronal clefts in the lumbar vertebrae,
deficient ossification in the dorsal vertebrae, and squared, flared
ilia. All long bones showed expansion of the metaphyses. At 4 years of
age, facial movement became difficult because of stiffness, and the
mouth opening was restricted. EMG showed pseudomyotonic discharges and
rapid firing of single units in multiple muscles. The 7,108-bp
homozygous deletion began at the 5-prime portion of exon 96 and extended
well beyond the 3-prime flanking sequence of HSPG2. The deletion created
2 aberrant transcripts: product 2, derived from intron 95 retention, and
product 1, resulting from failure of splicing of both introns 94 and 95,
predicted to produce truncated proteins missing approximately 35 and
approximately 64 amino acids from the C-terminal portion, respectively.

601651	TITLE *601651 NUCLEOSOME ASSEMBLY PROTEIN 1-LIKE 4; NAP1L4
;;NUCLEOSOME ASSEMBLY PROTEIN 2-LIKE; NAP2L;;
NAP2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Hu et al. (1996) used a positional cloning approach to isolate a gene
which is located 100 kb centromeric to the proximal Beckwith-Wiedemann
breakpoint cluster region (BWS; 130650) on chromosome 11p15. This gene
is homologous to the yeast nucleosome assembly protein NAP1 (164060).
The authors designated the new gene NAP2. They demonstrated that this
gene shows biallelic expression in all tissues tested and that it
therefore diverges in its expression from IGF2 (147470), H19 (103280),
and p57(KIP2) (600856), which also map to 11p15.5 in the vicinity of the
BWS gene. The NAP2 gene encodes a highly acidic protein of 375 amino
acids.

GENE STRUCTURE

Rodriguez et al. (1997) reported that the NAP1L4 gene consists of 14
exons and spans approximately 30.5 kb. A 1,200-bp 3-prime untranslated
region was present.

MAPPING

Hu et al. (1996) mapped the NAP1L4 gene to chromosome 11p15.5.

GENE FUNCTION

Histones are thought to play a key role in regulating gene expression at
the level of DNA packaging. The deduced amino acid sequence of NAP2
indicates that it is a protein with a potential nuclear localization
motif and 2 clusters of highly acidic residues. By functional analysis
of recombinant NAP2 protein purified from Escherichia coli, Rodriguez et
al. (1997) found that this protein can interact with both core and
linker histones (see 142709). They demonstrated that recombinant NAP2
can transfer histones onto naked DNA templates. Subcellular localization
studies of NAP2 indicated that it can shuttle between the cytoplasm and
nucleus, suggesting a role as a histone chaperone.

NAP1 and NAP2 facilitate nucleosome assembly by first depositing
preformed tetramers made up of 2 molecules each of histones H3 (see
602810) and H4 (see 602822) onto DNA prior to the addition of tetramers
made up of 2 molecules each of histones H2A (see 142720) and H2B (see
609904). Using recombinant human proteins in an in vitro nucleosome
formation assay, Tachiwana et al. (2008) confirmed that both NAP1 and
NAP2 promoted formation of nucleosomes containing the conventional
histones H2A, H2B, H3.1 (see 602810), and H4. NAP1 could also promote
nucleosome assembly with the H3 variants H3.2 (HIST2H3C; 142780), H3.3
(see 601128), and CENPA (117139), but not the testis-specific H3 variant
H3T (HIST3H3; 602820). In contrast, NAP2 promoted nucleosome assembly
with H3T, bound H3T/H4 tetramers efficiently, and was released from
H3T/H4 tetramers in the presence of DNA. Mutation analysis revealed that
a change of ala111, which is conserved among H3.1, H3.2, and H3.3, to
val in H3T was responsible for the differential binding of these H3
variants to NAP1.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

NAP1L4 maps to a region implicated in Wilms tumor etiology (see 194071).
Rodriguez et al. (1997) analyzed the gene encoding NAP2 for mutations
and found no evidence of nonsense, frameshift, or deletion mutations.
Their findings, coupled with tumor suppression assays in Wilms tumor
cells, did not support a role for NAP2 in the etiology of that neoplasm.

613940	TITLE *613940 SPERMATOGENESIS-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 5; SPATA5
;;SPERMATOGENESIS-ASSOCIATED FACTOR; SPAF
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Liu et al. (2000) cloned mouse Spata5, which they called Spaf. The
deduced 892-amino acid protein contains a putative mitochondrial
localization signal and 2 ATPase modules typical of AAA family proteins
(see 601681). Northern blot analysis of mouse tissues detected high
expression of a 3-kb Spaf transcript in testis, with much weaker
expression in spleen and little to no expression in other tissues
examined. Spaf was also highly expressed as 3- and 1.7-kb transcripts in
mouse 03RAT cells, which were derived from a poorly differentiated
squamous cell carcinoma. Immunohistochemical analysis detected Spaf in
prepubertal and adult mouse testis, where it was expressed in
spermatogonia and early spermatocytes up to the zygotene stage. Spaf was
not detected in somatic cells of testis. Spaf distributed diffusely
throughout the cytoplasm of germ cells and also localized to
mitochondria. Western blot analysis detected endogenous and in
vitro-translated Spaf at an apparent molecular mass of 97 kD.

MAPPING

Hartz (2011) mapped the SPATA5 gene to chromosome 4q28.1 based on an
alignment of the SPATA5 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF361489) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

602726	TITLE *602726 CHLORIDE CHANNEL 6; CLCN6
;;CLC6
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Members of the mammalian CLCN family of voltage-gated chloride channels
display differential tissue distribution and perform diverse functions.
Nomura et al. (1994) identified a partial human CLCN6 cDNA, which they
called KIAA0046. Northern blot analysis revealed that CLCN6 was
expressed widely. Using the partial cDNA sequence of Nomura et al.
(1994), Brandt and Jentsch (1995) cloned human cerebral cortex cDNAs
that covered the entire CLCN6 coding region. The predicted 869-amino
acid protein was called CLC6 by them. The amino acid sequence of CLCN6
is 45% identical to that of CLCN7 (602727) but only 23 to 29% identical
to the sequences of other known CLCNs. Therefore, Brandt and Jentsch
(1995) stated that CLCN6 and CLCN7 together define a new branch of the
chloride channel protein family. By Northern blot analysis, Brandt and
Jentsch (1995) found that CLCN6 was expressed as an approximately 6-kb
mRNA in all tissues examined. Eggermont et al. (1997) identified 4
different CLCN6 cDNAs that represent alternatively spliced transcripts.

MAPPING

Nomura et al. (1994) mapped the CLCN6 gene to chromosome 1 using a
somatic cell hybrid panel. By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Brandt
and Jentsch (1995) refined the localization of the CLCN6 gene to 1p36.
They noted that 2 genes encoding kidney-specific chloride channels,
CLCNKA (602024) and CLCNKB (602023), also map to 1p36.

ANIMAL MODEL

Poet et al. (2006) found expression of the Clcn6 gene in neurons of
mouse brain, dorsal root ganglia, spinal cord, and eye. Clcn6
colocalized with markers for late endosomes in neuronal cell bodies.
Clcn6-null mice showed reduced pain sensitivity and developed moderate
behavioral abnormalities. Neuronal tissues from these mice showed
enlarged proximal axons containing autofluorescent electron-dense
storage material, positive for lysosomal proteins. Poet et al. (2006)
suggested that CLCN6 may be a candidate gene for mild forms of human
neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (see, e.g., CLN1; 256730).

610739	TITLE *610739 TRINUCLEOTIDE REPEAT-CONTAINING GENE 6A; TNRC6A
;;GLYCINE/TRYPTOPHAN REPEAT PROTEIN, 182-KD; GW182;;
KIAA1460
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TNRC6A, or GW182, is a component of a cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein
complex involved in regulating mRNA silencing, stability, and
translation (Schneider et al., 2006).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned TNRC6A, which they designated
KIAA1460. RT-PCR ELISA detected TNRC6A expression in all tissues and
specific brain regions examined, with highest expression in whole adult
brain.

Using autoimmune sera from a patient with a motor and sensory
polyneuropathy to screen a HeLa cell cDNA library, followed by database
analysis and PCR, Eystathioy et al. (2002) cloned full-length TNRC6A,
which they called GW182. The deduced 1,709-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 182 kD. It contains a central nuclear
localization signal, a C-terminal RNA recognition motif, numerous
glycine/tryptophan (GW) repeats, and multiple phosphorylation sites.
Northern blot analysis detected a 7.5-kb GW182 transcript in all tissues
examined, with highest expression in heart. Labeling with radioactive
phosphate indicated that GW182 is a phosphoprotein. Immunolocalization
in HepG2 cells showed GW182 in unique membrane-free cytoplasmic bodies
that Eystathioy et al. (2002) called GW bodies. The number of GW bodies
ranged from 0 in mitotic cells to 30 in some interphase cells, and they
varied in size.

Schneider et al. (2006) stated that the 1,690-amino acid GW182 protein
has a GW-rich N-terminal domain, a central glutamine-rich region, and a
C-terminal RNA recognition motif.

GENE FUNCTION

Eystathioy et al. (2002) found that anti-GW182 antibodies
immunoprecipitated a wide range of mRNAs. They proposed that GW bodies
are ribonucleoprotein complexes that may be involved in regulating
transcripts required for cell growth and homeostasis.

Eystathioy et al. (2003) found that the most common clinical diagnosis
of patients with anti-GW182 antibodies was Sjogren syndrome (270150),
followed by mixed motor/sensory neuropathy and systemic lupus
erythematosus (SLE; 152700).

Using immunogold electron microscopy, Yang et al. (2004) showed that GW
bodies were 100 to 300 nm in diameter and that they lacked a lipid
membrane. The structures appeared to comprise clusters of strands 8 to
10 nm in diameter. Using synchronized HeLa cells, Yang et al. (2004)
found that GW bodies were small in early S phase and larger during late
S and G2 phases of the cell cycle. The majority of GW bodies
disassembled prior to mitosis, and small GW bodies reassembled in early
G1. Proliferating mouse cells contained larger, brighter, and more
numerous GW bodies and had up to 5-fold more total Gw182 protein than
quiescent cells. In vitro knockdown of Gw182 led to the disappearance of
GW bodies.

Jakymiw et al. (2005) found that endogenous AGO2 (EIF2C2; 606229) and
transfected small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) accumulated in GW bodies in
HeLa cells, and that GW182 interacted with AGO2. An N-terminal fragment
of GW182 did not localize to GW bodies, and this construct disrupted GW
bodies in HeLa cells and interfered with the silencing capability of an
siRNA specific to lamin-A/C (LMNA; 150330). Jakymiw et al. (2005)
concluded that GW182 and/or the microenvironment of the cytoplasmic GW
bodies contribute to the RNA-induced silencing complex and to RNA
silencing.

Schneider et al. (2006) found that gawky, the Drosophila ortholog of the
human GW182 family, localized to punctate, cytoplasmic foci in an
RNA-dependent manner. Reducing gawky activity by mutation or antibody
injection during syncytial embryo development led to abnormal nuclear
divisions, demonstrating an early requirement of GW body-mediated
cytoplasmic mRNA regulation.

By microarray analysis, Behm-Ansmant et al. (2006) found that depletion
of Gw182 led to changes in the mRNA expression profile in Drosophila S2
cells similar to those observed following Ago1 depletion. When Gw182 was
bound to a reporter transcript, it silenced its expression, bypassing
the requirement for Ago1, and Gw182 both repressed protein expression
and promoted mRNA decay. Behm-Ansmant et al. (2006) also showed that the
N-terminal GW repeats of Gw182 interacted with the PIWI domain of Ago1.
They concluded that GW182 links the microRNA pathway to mRNA degradation
by interacting with AGO1.

GENE STRUCTURE

Eystathioy et al. (2002) determined that the TNRC6A gene contains 22
exons and spans 46 kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (2000) mapped the TNRC6A
gene to chromosome 16. Eystathioy et al. (2002) mapped the TNRC6A gene
to chromosome 16p12 by genomic sequence analysis.

601482	TITLE *601482 DOWNREGULATOR OF TRANSCRIPTION 1, TBP-BINDING; DR1
;;TATA BOX-BINDING PROTEIN-ASSOCIATED PHOSPHOPROTEIN DR1;;
NEGATIVE COFACTOR 2-BETA;;
NC2-BETA
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Several phosphoproteins interact with TBP, the TATA box-binding protein
(600075). Among them, DR1 is a TBP-associated phosphoprotein that
represses both basal and activated levels of transcription. Inostroza et
al. (1992) biochemically characterized DR1 purified from HeLa cells and
cloned the human gene from a HeLa cell cDNA library. The gene encodes a
176-amino acid polypeptide of 19 kD. They showed that DR1 is
phosphorylated in vivo and that phosphorylation of DR1 affected its
interaction with TBP.

Using Northern blot analysis, Inostroza et al. (1992) and Mermelstein et
al. (1996) detected varying levels of 1.5- and 3.4-kb DR1 transcripts in
all tissues examined. By Northern blot analysis of rat tissues, Purello
et al. (1996) detected a 3.6 kb mRNA in all tested tissues, with a
second 1.8 kb message in testis. The highest level of expression was
seen in testis.

GENE FUNCTION

Mermelstein et al. (1996) identified DR1-associated protein-1 (DRAP1;
602289), a corepressor of DR1 that enhances DR1-mediated repression of
transcription. Mermelstein et al. (1996) immunodetected DR1 protein in
all cell populations of the developing rat brain: actively dividing stem
cells, nondividing migratory neurons, and nondividing, highly
differentiated neurons. Based on the differential expression of DR1 and
DRAP1 proteins in the developing rat brain, Mermelstein et al. (1996)
suggested that DR1-mediated repression of transcription is higher in
nondividing, highly differentiated cells than in actively dividing
cells.

The DR1 protein contains 3 domains: a histone fold motif at the N
terminus, a TBP-binding domain, and a glutamine- and alanine-rich
region. Mermelstein et al. (1996) showed that the histone fold motif of
DR1 is required for DR1-DRAP1 interaction. Both the TBP-binding domain
and the glutamine- and alanine-rich region are required for DR1-mediated
repression of transcription. Yeung et al. (1997) demonstrated that the
TBP-binding domain has 2 functions: it tethers the DR1 repressor complex
to the promoter by interacting with TBP, and it is required for the
corepression activity of DRAP1, although it is not required for
DR1-DRAP1 interaction. Yeung et al. (1997) determined that the
glutamine- and alanine-rich region is the repressor domain of DR1 and
that this domain interacts with TBP. Goppelt et al. (1996) proposed that
binding of DR1 repressor complexes to TBP-promoter complexes establishes
a mechanism in which an altered DNA conformation, together with the
formation of higher order complexes, inhibits the assembly of the
preinitiation complex and controls the rate of RNA polymerase II
transcription.

Willy et al. (2000) identified an activity that was required for
transcription of downstream promoter element (DPE)-containing core
promoters in vitro. The purified factor was found to be the Drosophila
homolog of the NC2 transcriptional repressor, also known as DR1-DRAP1.
Drosophila Nc2 is composed of a 43-kD subunit homologous to DRAP1
(NC2-alpha) and a 22-kD subunit homologous to DR1 (NC2-beta). Purified
recombinant Drosophila Nc2 activated DPE-driven promoters and repressed
TATA-driven promoters. A mutant version of Drosophila Nc2 could activate
DPE promoters but was unable to repress TATA promoters. Thus, the
activation and repression functions are distinct. Willy et al. (2000)
concluded that NC2 is a bifunctional basal transcription factor that
differentially regulates gene transcription through DPE or TATA box
motifs.

Using mass spectrometry, Wang et al. (2008) identified NC2-beta as a
component of the ADA2A (TADA2A; 602276)-containing (ATAC) histone
acetyltransferase complex in HeLa cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Rozet et al. (1996) determined that the DR1 gene contains 3 exons and
spans 15 kb of genomic DNA.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Kamada et al. (2001) determined the x-ray structure of a ternary complex
of NC2, TBP, and DNA at 2.6-angstrom resolution. The N termini of
NC2-alpha and -beta resemble histones H2A (see 613499) and H2B (see
609904), respectively, and form a heterodimer that binds to the bent DNA
double helix on the underside of the preformed TBP-DNA complex via
electrostatic interactions. NC2-beta contributes to inhibition of
TATA-dependent transcription through interactions of its C-terminal
alpha helix with a conserved hydrophobic feature on the upper surface of
TBP, which in turn positions the penultimate alpha helix of NC2-beta to
block recognition of the TBP-DNA complex by transcription factor IIB
(189963).

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Rozet et al. (1996) mapped the
DR1 gene to 1p22.1. Purello et al. (1996) used somatic cell genetics and
fluorescence in situ hybridization to map the DR1 gene to human
chromosome region 1p21-p13. Southern blot analysis showed that the gene
is present as a single copy in the genomes of all eukaryotes examined.

Kaplan et al. (1993) mapped an expressed sequence tag (EST) of the DR1
gene to the YAC contig encompassing the Stargardt disease locus (STGD;
248200) on 1p. Using SSCP analysis of genomic DNA amplified with
specific primers in 10 controls and 35 unrelated patients with either
Stargardt disease (26 patients) or late-onset fundus flavimaculatus, a
condition allelic to STGD (9 patients), Rozet et al. (1996) found no
mutation in the DR1 gene. Rozet et al. (1996) were not able to study the
promoter of the gene, but the findings suggested that DR1 is not
involved in Stargardt disease.

613962	TITLE *613962 TASTE RECEPTOR, TYPE 2, MEMBER 20; TAS2R20
;;T2R56
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TAS2R20 belongs to the large TAS2R receptor family. TAS2Rs are expressed
on the surface of taste receptor cells and mediate the perception of
bitterness through a G protein-coupled second messenger pathway (summary
by Conte et al., 2002). For further information on the TAS2R gene
family, see 604791.

CLONING

By screening the human genome for sequences related to TAS2Rs, Conte et
al. (2002) cloned TAS2R20, which they called T2R56. The deduced
309-amino acid protein contains the 7-transmembrane structure and short
N- and C-terminal domains conserved in TAS2Rs. The intracellular domains
share significant conservation with other TAS2R family members. TAS2R20
shares highest sequence similarity with TAS2R36.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid and genomic sequence analyses, Conte et al.
(2002) mapped the TAS2R20 gene to an approximately 1.2-Mb cluster on
chromosome 12p.

Gross (2011) mapped the TAS2R20 gene to chromosome 12p13.2 based on an
alignment of the TAS2R20 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF494236) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

605981	TITLE *605981 UBIQUITIN-PROTEIN LIGASE E3 COMPONENT N-RECOGNIN 1; UBR1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

A number of regulatory circuits involve metabolically unstable proteins.
Short in vivo half-lives are also characteristic of damaged or otherwise
abnormal proteins. Features of proteins that confer metabolic
instability are called degradation signals, or degrons. The essential
component of one degradation signal, called the N-degron, is a
destabilizing N-terminal residue of a protein. The set of amino acids
that are destabilizing in a given cell type yields a rule, called the
N-end rule, which relates the in vivo half-life of a protein to the
identity of its N-terminal residue. Similar but distinct versions of the
N-end rule pathway are present in all organisms that have been examined,
from mammals to fungi and bacteria. The N-end rule pathway is one
proteolytic pathway of the ubiquitin system. The recognition component
of this pathway, called N-recognin or E3, binds to a destabilizing
N-terminal residue of a substrate protein and participates in the
formation of a substrate-linked multiubiquitin chain (summary by Kwon et
al., 1998).

CLONING

Kwon et al. (1998) isolated full-length mouse Ubr1 cDNAs and partial
human UBR1 cDNAs, which encode an N-recognin called E3-alpha. The mouse
Ubr1 protein is a 1,757-residue, 200-kD protein that contains regions
with sequence similarity to the 225-kD UBR1 protein of S. cerevisiae.
There are apparent UBR1 homologs in other eukaryotes, thus defining a
distinct family of proteins, the UBR family. The residues essential for
substrate recognition by the yeast UBR1 protein are conserved in the
mouse Ubr1 protein. Regions of similarity among the UBR family members
include a putative zinc finger and RING-H2 finger, another zinc-binding
domain. Northern blot analysis detected ubiquitous expression in human
and adult mouse tissues, with highest levels in skeletal muscle and
heart. In mouse embryos, in situ hybridization showed that Ubr1
expression is highest in the branchial arches and in the tail and limb
buds. The authors suggested that the cloning of UBR1 makes possible the
construction of Ubr1-lacking mouse strains, a prerequisite for the
functional understanding of the mammalian N-end rule pathway.

GENE STRUCTURE

Zenker et al. (2005) stated that the UBR1 gene, which encodes one of the
E3 ubiquitin ligases of the N-end rule pathway, spans approximately 161
kb and contains 47 exons. The mouse Ubr1 gene spans approximately 120 kb
of genomic DNA and contains approximately 50 exons (Kwon et al., 1998).

MAPPING

By interspecific backcross analysis, Kwon et al. (1998) mapped the mouse
Ubr1 gene to the middle of chromosome 2. They mapped the human UBR1 gene
to 15q15-q21.1, which shows homology of synteny with mouse chromosome 2.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Johanson-Blizzard syndrome (JBS; 243800) is an autosomal recessive
disorder that includes congenital exocrine pancreatic insufficiency,
multiple malformations such as nasal wing aplasia, and, frequently,
mental retardation. By homozygosity mapping in 7 kindreds with JBS,
Zenker et al. (2005) mapped the phenotype to 15q14-q21.1. There was no
obvious candidate gene based on putative function and expression data
found in the interval, but by high-throughput direct sequencing of DNA
from individuals with JBS, they eventually detected mutations in the
gene UBR1. In affected individuals from 12 of 13 families included in
the study, the variations likely to be causal mutations were identified
in both alleles of UBR1, whereas in 1 family, only the paternally
inherited mutation was found. Most disease-associated UBR1 alleles (12
of 14) were mutations that predicted premature translational stop
codons. Two missense mutations in UBR1 caused substitutions of residues
that are conserved among UBR1 proteins of different species. One of
these missense mutations, H136R (605981.0001), affected a conserved
motif in the region of UBR1 found to be important for substrate binding
(Tasaki et al., 2005). Two apparently unrelated and nonconsanguineous
families originating from the same district in Costa Rica shared the
same homozygous mutation, Q513X (605981.0003). Haplotype analysis in
these families provided evidence for a common ancestor.

ANIMAL MODEL

To analyze molecular aspects of perturbations in Johanson-Blizzard
syndrome that would be difficult or impossible to address in human
autopsy material, Zenker et al. (2005) used Ubr1 -/- mice. These mice
were viable and fertile and lacked substantial phenotypic abnormalities
other than reduced weight, with disproportionate decreases in skeletal
muscle and adipose tissue (Kwon et al., 2001). Among other findings, the
pancreas of Ubr1 -/- mice was considerably (approximately 100 times)
less responsive to stimulation with the physiologic secretagogue
cholecystokinin (118440). This difference suggested that a signaling
circuit that couples the secretion of pancreatic enzymes to the level of
a secretion-causing compound is controlled by the N-end rule pathway.
Further analysis used an in vivo model of acinar cell stress and
experimental pancreatitis in which supraphysiologic concentrations of
secretagogue resulted in a 'paradoxical' block of pancreatic secretion.
They found that this treatment led to a more severe injury of Ubr1 -/-
pancreas, compared with wildtype, with prominent necrosis in the
deficient pancreas, as indicated by histologic evidence, serum amylase
levels, and other parameters of local pancreatic injury or systemic
inflammatory response. The results suggested that the intact (as
distinguished from Ubr1-deficient) N-end rule pathway contributes to
pancreatic homeostasis and defense against noxious stimuli in pancreatic
acinar cells.

In a Dutch patient with Johanson-Blizzard syndrome (JBS; 243800) and
nonconsanguineous parents, Zenker et al. (2005) described compound
heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the UBR1 gene: a 407A-G transition in
exon 3 resulting in a his136-to-arg (H136R) amino acid change, and a
splice donor site mutation, IVS20+2T-C (605981.0002).

UBR1, GLN513TER

Zenker et al. (2005) found that 2 apparently unrelated nonconsanguineous
families originating from the same district in Costa Rica shared the
same homozygous mutation, gln513 to stop (Q513X), as the basis of
Johanson-Blizzard syndrome (JBS; 243800). These were Costa Rican Indian
families. Haplotype analysis provided evidence of a common ancestor. The
amino acid change was caused by a C-to-T transition at nucleotide 1537
in exon 13.

JOHANSON-BLIZZARD SYNDROME
UBR1, IVS26DS, G-A, +5

In 2 unrelated girls with a mild form of Johanson-Blizzard syndrome
(243800), Elting et al. (2008) identified a homozygous G-to-A transition
in intron 26 of the UBR1 gene. The girls were born of Turkish and
Iranian consanguineous parents, respectively. In addition to the mild
but classic features of the disorder, 1 girl had dilated cardiomyopathy,
whereas the other had a small atrial septal defect. A small amount of
normally spliced mRNA was detected in 1 of the girls, suggesting some
residual normal protein production.

JOHANSON-BLIZZARD SYNDROME
UBR1, IVS12AS, G-A, -1

In a male infant, born of consanguineous Saudi Arabian parents, with
Johanson-Blizzard syndrome (243800), Al-Dosari et al. (2008) identified
a homozygous G-to-A transition in intron 12 of the UBR1 gene, predicted
to result in the skipping of exon 13, a frameshift, and premature
termination. The mutation was not found in 130 control chromosomes. At
birth, the patient had low birth weight, dysmorphic features with
aplastic alae nasi and unusual hair pattern, imperforate anus, hearing
loss, and hypothyroidism. He also developed severe liver involvement
with cholestasis and fibrosis causing liver failure. He did not have
evidence of pancreatic insufficiency.

314690	TITLE *314690 LYSINE-SPECIFIC DEMETHYLASE 5C; KDM5C
;;JUMONJI, AT-RICH INTERACTIVE DOMAIN 1C; JARID1C;;
SELECTED cDNA ON X, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF; SMCX;;
XE169;;
DXS1272E
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The KDM5C gene encodes a specific H3K4me3 and H3K4me2 demethylase, and
acts as a transcriptional repressor through the RE-1-silencing
transcription factor (REST) complex (Tahiliani et al., 2007).

CLONING

Wu et al. (1994) reported the isolation and characterization of cDNAs
for XE169, a non-pseudoautosomal region (PAR)-encoded human gene. The
sequence appeared to represent a full-length or nearly full-length cDNA
for the gene. Alternative splicing generates 2 distinct transcripts,
either containing or missing 9 nucleotides, which in turn predicts 2
XE169 protein isoforms composed of 1,557 and 1,560 amino acids,
respectively. XE169 is expressed in multiple human tissues, and
homologous sequences exist on the human Y chromosome and in the genomes
of 5 other eutherian mammals examined. RT-PCR analysis of somatic cell
hybrids containing either an active or an inactive human X chromosome on
a rodent background demonstrated that XE169 escapes X inactivation.

Jensen et al. (2005) reported that the JARID1C protein shares amino acid
identity of 85%, 51%, and 47% with JARID1D/SMCY (426000), JARID1A
(180202), and JARID1B (605393), respectively. The JARID1C protein
contains several domains conserved among the JARID proteins, including a
JmjN domain, an Arid/Bright domain, a JmjC domain, a C5HC2 zinc finger
domain, and PHD zinc finger domains. Northern blot analysis detected
varying expression of a 6.0-kb transcript in almost all adult human
tissues examined, with strongest expression in brain and skeletal muscle
and weakest expression in heart and liver.

GENE FUNCTION

The JARID1C gene was thought to escape X inactivation. Agulnik et al.
(1994) observed that in hamster/human hybrids, Jarid1c was expressed
when either an active or an inactive human X chromosome was present.
Furthermore, 2 alleles of Smcx were found to be expressed in t(16;X)16H
female mice despite the intact X chromosome being inactive in all cells.
Lingenfelter et al. (1998) showed that Smcx is susceptible to complete X
inactivation in a portion of mouse embryonic cells. Furthermore, Smcx
inactivation persists in some cells at least until 13.5 days postcoitum.
A highly variable Smcx expression found during mouse development
progressively disappears in adult tissues where nearly equal expression
between alleles is observed. Sheardown et al. (1996) demonstrated that
the mouse Jarid1c gene exhibits partial X inactivation in embryos, in
extraembryonic lineages, and in several adult tissues, showing an
expression of 20 to 70% from the inactive, compared with the active, X
allele. Xu et al. (2002) observed that Jarid1c and Jarid1d are expressed
in mouse brain in a sex-specific fashion; in adult mouse brain, Jarid1c
is expressed at a significantly higher level in females than in males,
and expression of Jarid1d in males was not sufficient to compensate for
the female bias in X-gene expression. Therefore, Jensen et al. (2005)
suggested that the X-Y gene pair JARID1C and JARID1D may not be
functionally equivalent, suggesting an indispensable role for JARID1C in
normal brain function.

Tahiliani et al. (2007) showed that JARID1C/SMCX, a JmjC
domain-containing protein implicated in X-linked mental retardation and
epilepsy, possesses H3K4 tridemethylase activity and functions as a
transcriptional repressor. An SMCX complex isolated from HeLa cells
contained additional chromatin modifiers (the histone deacetylases HDAC1
(601241) and HDAC2 (605164), and the histone H3K9 methyltransferase G9a
(604599)) and the transcriptional repressor REST (600571), suggesting a
direct role for SMCX in chromatin dynamics and REST-mediated repression.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed that SMCX and REST co-occupy the
neuron-restrictive silencing elements in the promoters of a subset of
REST target genes. RNA interference-mediated depletion of SMCX
derepressed several of these targets and simultaneously increased H3K4
trimethylation at the sodium channel type 2A (SCN2A; 182390) and
synapsin I (SYN1; 313440) promoters. Tahiliani et al. (2007) proposed
that loss of SMCX activity impairs REST-mediated neuronal gene
regulation, thereby contributing to SMCX-associated X-linked mental
retardation.

Using a genomewide small interfering RNA screen and secondary screens,
Smith et al. (2010) identified 96 cellular genes that contributed to
viral E2 protein-mediated repression of the human papillomavirus (HPV)
long control region, which controls viral oncogene expression. In
addition to the E2-binding protein BRD4 (608749), other genes implicated
included the demethylase SMCX and EP400 (606265), a component of the
NUA4/TIP60 histone acetyltransferase complex (see 601409). Smith et al.
(2010) concluded that HPV E2 uses multiple cellular proteins to inhibit
expression of its oncogenes.

GENE STRUCTURE

Jensen et al. (2005) stated that the SMCX gene comprises 26 exons.

MAPPING

By Southern hybridization analysis of a panel of human/mouse somatic
cell hybrids containing various portions of translocated human X
chromosomes, Wu et al. (1994) assigned the XE169 gene to the proximal
half of the short arm of the X chromosome between Xp21.1 and the
centromere.

Wu et al. (1994) assigned Xe169 to band F2/F3 on the mouse X chromosome
by fluorescence in situ hybridization, and Southern analysis indicated
that the gene is located outside the pseudoautosomal region.

Using direct in situ hybridization, Agulnik et al. (1994) mapped the
mouse Smcx gene to the distal end of the X chromosome (XF2-XF4) and its
human homolog, SMCX, to proximal Xp (Xp11.2-p11.1). Meiotic mapping in
the mouse placed Smcx in the interval between Plp and Pdha1.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a systematic screen of brain-expressed genes from the proximal Xp and
pericentromeric regions of the X chromosome in 210 families with
X-linked mental retardation (XLMR), Jensen et al. (2005) identified
mutations in the JARID1C gene in affected members of 7 families with
MRXSCJ (300534), including 1 frameshift and 2 nonsense mutations, as
well as 4 missense mutations that altered evolutionarily conserved amino
acids. In 2 of these families, expression studies revealed the almost
complete absence of the mutated JARID1C transcript, suggesting that the
phenotype in these families resulted from functional loss of the JARID1C
protein. The JARID1C gene, formerly known as SMCX, is highly similar to
the Y chromosome gene that encodes the H-Y antigen variously known as
JARID1D, SMCY, and HYA (426000). Jensen et al. (2005) noted that in
families with nonsyndromic XLMR, more than 30% of mutations seem to
cluster on the proximal part of the short arm of the X chromosome and in
the pericentric region. The authors estimated that the frequency of
mutations in the JARID1C gene account for 2.8% to 3.3% families with
XLMR.

In 4 of 287 probands with X-linked mental retardation, Abidi et al.
(2008) identified 4 different mutations in the JARID1C gene (see, e.g.,
314690.0007).

Poeta et al. (2013) found that ARX (300382) bound to conserved noncoding
elements in the 5-prime region of the KDM5C gene, resulting in increased
expression of KDM5C. In vitro cellular expression studies showed that
transfection of 5 ARX mutants (see, e.g., 300382.0022) that cause
intellectual disability or severe epilepsy resulted in variably
decreased activation of the KDM5C gene compared to wildtype ARX. The
changes in polyA repeats caused hypomorphic ARX alterations, which
exhibit a decreased transactivity and reduced, but not abolished,
binding to the KDM5C regulatory region. The altered functioning of the
mutants tested correlated with the severity of the associated phenotype.
Quantitative RT-PCR studies showed a dramatic decrease of Kdm5c mRNA in
murine Arx-null embryonic and neural stem cells. The decrease in the
KDM5C content during in vitro neuronal differentiation inversely
correlated with increased histone regulation, as measured by H3K4me3
levels. The findings linked ARX polyA expansions to KDM5C, mutations of
which cause a similar phenotype, and established that ARX polyA
alterations damage the regulation of KDM5C expression, suggesting a
pathogenic pathway involving changes in chromatin remodeling in these
neurologic disorders.

OTHER FEATURES

Agulnik et al. (1994) isolated a mouse Y chromosome gene from the region
encoding Spy, a spermatogenesis gene, and Hya and Sdma, the genes that,
respectively, control the expression of the male specific minor
histocompatibility antigen H-Y, as measured by specific T-cell assays,
and the serologically detected male antigen SDMA. See 426000 for a
discussion of SMCY (so named for 'selected mouse cDNA on Y') and its
human homolog. The murine gene maps to Yp; the human homolog, SMCY, maps
to Yq.

KDM5C, LEU731PHE

In affected members of a family with syndromic X-linked mental
retardation (300534) originally reported by Claes et al. (2000), Jensen
et al. (2005) detected a C-to-T transition at nucleotide 2191 in exon 16
of the JARID1C gene that changed leucine to phenylalanine at codon 731
(L731F). Jensen et al. (2005) suggested that the L731F mutation, which
is located in an evolutionarily conserved C5HC2 zinc finger domain, may
have a profound effect on that domain as a result of the difference in
size and chemical properties between leucine and phenylalanine.

MENTAL RETARDATION, X-LINKED, SYNDROMIC, CLAES-JENSEN TYPE
KDM5C, 1-BP INS, 202C

In 2 brothers with a severe form of mental retardation (300534), Jensen
et al. (2005) identified a single-nucleotide insertion of a cytidine
(202_203insC) in exon 2 of the JARID1C gene that introduced a frameshift
with premature stop codon at codon 75 (R68fsX7). The change was not
found in 312 control X chromosomes. The authors suggested that the
mutation, which did not seem to undergo nonsense-mediated decay (NMD),
may cause the aberrant phenotype through either extreme shortening of
the protein and deletion of relevant domains, or through production of
an abnormal protein by alternative use of a methionine downstream of
exon 2. With an almost identical phenotype, both brothers had had
removal of the gallbladder because of gallstones, at ages 20 and 31
years, respectively.

.0003
MENTAL RETARDATION, X-LINKED, SYNDROMIC, CLAES-JENSEN TYPE
KDM5C, ALA388PRO

In a family with 4 males who presented with mental retardation and
microcephaly (300534), Jensen et al. (2005) observed an 1162G-to-C
transversion in exon 9 of the JARID1C gene that caused an ala388-to-pro
(A388P) amino acid substitution.

.0004
MENTAL RETARDATION, X-LINKED, SYNDROMIC, CLAES-JENSEN TYPE
KDM5C, ARG694TER

In 2 brothers with X-linked mental retardation and short stature
(300534), Jensen et al. (2005) found a 2080C-to-T transition in exon 15
of the JARID1C gene that caused a premature termination at arg694
(R694X). KDM5C mRNA expression was almost undetectable, indicating
nonsense-mediated decay (NMD).

.0005
MENTAL RETARDATION, X-LINKED, SYNDROMIC, CLAES-JENSEN TYPE
KDM5C, SER451ARG

In 2 male sibs with X-linked mental retardation (300534), Santos et al.
(2006) identified a 1353C-G transversion in exon 10 of the JARID1C gene,
resulting in a ser451-to-arg (S451R) substitution. The unaffected mother
was heterozygous for the mutation, which was not identified in 250
control chromosomes.

.0006
MENTAL RETARDATION, X-LINKED, SYNDROMIC, CLAES-JENSEN TYPE
KDM5C, ARG766TRP

In a 4-year-old boy with cognitive impairment (300534), Adegbola et al.
(2008) identified a hemizygous 2296C-T transition in exon 16 of the
JARID1C gene, resulting in an arg766-to-trp (R766W) substitution. His
unaffected mother also carried the mutation. Detailed neuropsychologic
testing of the patient showed significant delays in perception, fine
motor skills, cognitive and language skills, and difficulty with
self-regulation. He also showed impairments in social reciprocity and
use of nonverbal behavior, stereotyped mannerisms, and adherence to
routine, consistent with autistic spectrum disorder. Although he had no
dysmorphic features as observed in many patients with KDM5C-related
mental retardation, Adegbola et al. (2008) noted that the phenotype
associated with mutations in the KDM5C gene is variable with regard to
dysmorphism and cognitive impairment; the authors suggested that this
patient falls within a milder end of the spectrum.

.0007
MENTAL RETARDATION, X-LINKED, SYNDROMIC, CLAES-JENSEN TYPE
KDM5C, ALA77THR

In affected members of a family with X-linked mental retardation
(300534), Abidi et al. (2008) identified a 229G-A transition in exon 3
of the JARID1C gene, resulting in an ala77-to-thr (A77T) substitution in
the ARID/BRIGHT domain. Additional features included short stature,
deep-set eyes, prominent nasal bridge, prominent ears, clubfeet, and
aggressive behavior. Three carrier females had mild mental retardation.
The mutation was not identified in 782 control X chromosomes.

.0008
MENTAL RETARDATION, X-LINKED, SYNDROMIC, CLAES-JENSEN TYPE
KDM5C, CYS724TER

In affected members of a Brazilian family with X-linked mental
retardation (300534), Santos-Reboucas et al. (2011) identified a 2172C-A
transversion in exon 15 of the KDM5C gene, resulting in a cys724-to-ter
(C724X) substitution in the C5HC2 zinc finger domain, resulting in
decreased protein expression likely from nonsense-mediated mRNA decay.
There were 3 affected brothers with severe mental retardation, poor
speech, short stature, low weight, microcephaly, high palate, slight
maxillary hypoplasia, and small feet. Their mother, who also carried the
mutation, was mildly cognitively impaired.

.0009
MENTAL RETARDATION, X-LINKED, SYNDROMIC, CLAES-JENSEN TYPE
KDM5C, PRO554THR

In affected members of a family with X-linked mental retardation
(300534), Rujirabanjerd et al. (2010) identified a 1160C-A transversion
in exon 12 of the KDM5C gene, resulting in a pro554-to-thr (P554T)
substitution at a highly conserved residue in the core of the JmjC
domain. Although the family had previously been designated as
nonsyndromic MRX13 (Kerr et al., 1992), Rujirabanjerd et al. (2010)
noted that affected individuals had short stature, large ears, and
microcephaly in addition to moderate intellectual disability. Two of 6
female carriers had learning difficulties. In vitro functional
expression studies showed that the mutant protein had significantly
decreased demethylase activity compared to wildtype. In an erratum, the
authors confirmed that the mutation was P554T; the mutation was
incorrectly stated as P544T in the abstract and text of their article.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Members of the cadherin superfamily are major cell-cell adhesion
molecules. See 601120. The cell-cell adhesion of fibroblasts is thought
to be necessary for wound healing. To elucidate the molecular basis of
fibroblast cell-cell adhesion, Matsuyoshi and Imamura (1997)
investigated cadherin expression in human fibroblasts by RT-PCR using
degenerate primers based on well-conserved amino acid sequences of
cadherins. They isolated partial cDNAs encoding PCDH2 (603627), FAT
(600976), and 3 novel cadherins, which they named FIB1, FIB2 (603058),
and FIB3 (603059). RT-PCR analysis revealed that FIB1 is expressed in
fibroblasts but not in melanocytes or keratinocytes.

EVOLUTION

Green et al. (2010) published a draft sequence of the Neandertal genome.
Comparisons of the Neandertal genome to the genomes of 5 present-day
humans from different parts of the world identified a number of genomic
regions that may have been affected by positive selection in ancestral
modern humans, including genes involved in metabolism and in cognitive
and skeletal development. Green et al. (2010) found 78 nucleotide
substitutions that change the protein coding capacity of genes where
modern humans are fixed for a derived state and where Neandertals carry
the ancestral (chimpanzee-like) state. Thus, relatively few amino acid
changes have become fixed in the last few hundred thousand years of
human evolution, an observation consistent with a complementary study
(Burbano et al., 2010). There are only 5 genes with more than 1 fixed
substitution changing the primary structure of the encoding proteins.
One of these is PCD16, which encodes fibroblast cadherin-1, a
calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion molecule that may be involved in
wound healing. Green et al. (2010) also showed that Neandertals shared
more genetic variants with present-day humans in Eurasia than with
present-day humans in sub-Saharan Africa, suggesting that gene flow from
Neandertals into the ancestors of non-Africans occurred before the
divergence of Eurasian groups from each other.
