DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Masuda et al. (1996) cloned a cDNA encoding calponin-2 (CNN2) by
screening a human heart cDNA library with a CNN1 (600806) cDNA. The CNN2
protein is 94.8% identical to mouse calponin h2 (see 600806), indicating
that these proteins are homologs. The predicted CNN2 protein has 309
amino acids and a pI of 7.1. It contains motifs that are present in CNN1
and CNN3 (602374): 3 tandem repeats of 29 amino acids, an actin-binding
domain, a VAV (164875)-homologous region, and 2 consensus
phosphorylation sites for tyrosine kinase at the C terminus. The 3-prime
untranslated region of the CNN2 mRNA contains an Alu repetitive sequence
in the antisense direction. RT-PCR detected CNN2 transcripts in both
cultured smooth muscle and nonmuscle cells and showed that mouse
calponin h2 is expressed in embryonic and adult heart. CNN2 protein
localizes to the cell-to-cell junctions of cardiomyocytes and
codistributes with vinculin (193065). Masuda et al. (1996) suggested
that CNN2 may be involved in the structural organization and/or
anchorage of actin filaments and may function in the cell adhesion
mechanism.

MAPPING

Cheng et al. (1994) mapped the CNN2 gene to chromosome 21q11.1 by
hybridization to chromosome 21q-specific YACs. However, Gross (2011)
mapped the CNN2 gene to chromosome 19p13.3 based on an alignment of the
CNN2 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC141833) with the genomic sequence
(GRCh37).

186852	TITLE *186852 PROTEASOME 26S SUBUNIT, ATPase, 3; PSMC3
;;TAT-BINDING PROTEIN 1; TBP1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) protein Tat is a potent
activator of virus gene expression and replication. Nelbock et al.
(1990) used biotinylated Tat as a probe to screen a lambda-gt11 fusion
protein library, thereby cloning a cDNA encoding a protein that
interacts with Tat. Expression of this protein, designated Tat-binding
protein-1, was observed in a variety of cell lines, with expression
being highest in human cells. TBP1 was localized predominantly in the
nucleus, which is consistent with the nuclear localization of Tat. In
cotransfection experiments, expression of TBP1 was able to suppress
Tat-mediated transactivation specifically. Nelbock et al. (1990)
recommended their strategy for direct identification and cloning of
genes encoding proteins that associate with other proteins to modulate
their activity in a positive or negative fashion. Ohana et al. (1993)
suggested that TBP1 is involved in Tat-mediated transcriptional
activation.

GENE FUNCTION

Ubiquitinated proteins are degraded by a 26S ATP-dependent protease. The
protease is composed of a 20S catalytic proteasome and 2 PA700
regulatory modules (see PSMC1; 602706). DeMartino et al. (1996)
identified a protein complex that enhances PA700 activation of the
proteasome. They found that 2 proteins, p42 (PSMC6; 602708) and p50
(PSMC3), are components of both this complex and PA700. By protein
sequence analysis, DeMartino et al. (1996) determined that p50 and TBP1
are identical.

Hoyle et al. (1997) stated that the PSMC3 gene encodes a protein with 1
AAA (ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities) domain (see
PSMC5; 601681) toward the C terminus.

Corn et al. (2003) established that pVHL (608537), the protein that is
mutant in von Hippel-Lindau syndrome (193300), binds to TBP1. TBP1
associates with the beta-domain of pVHL and complexes with pVHL and
hypoxia-inducible transcription factor HIF1A (603348) in vivo.
Overexpression of TBP1 promotes degradation of HIF1A in a pVHL-dependent
manner that requires the ATPase domain of TBP1. Several distinct
mutations in exon 2 of the VHL gene disrupt binding of pVHL to TBP1. A
pVHL mutant containing an exon 2 missense substitution
coimmunoprecipitated with HIF1A, but not TBP1, and did not promote
degradation of HIF1A. Thus, the ability of pVHL to degrade HIF1A depends
in part on its interaction with TBP1 and suggests a new mechanism for
HIF1A stabilization in some pVHL-deficient tumors.

MAPPING

By PCR amplification of a partial PSMC3 sequence, Hoyle et al. (1997)
demonstrated that the PSMC3 gene is located on chromosome 11. By
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), the assignment was
regionalized to 11p13-p12. Tanahashi et al. (1998) mapped the PSMC3 gene
to 11p11.2 by FISH. By interspecific backcross analysis, Sakao et al.
(2000) mapped the mouse Psmc3 gene to chromosome 2.

601204	TITLE *601204 PROSTAGLANDIN F2 RECEPTOR NEGATIVE REGULATOR; PTGFRN
;;FP REGULATORY PROTEIN; FPRP;;
CD9 PARTNER 1; CD9P1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Orlicky et al. (1996) isolated a protein that copurifies with bovine
prostaglandin F(2-alpha) receptor (PTGFR; 600563) and cloned the
corresponding rat cDNA. Transfection experiments suggested that this
protein, which the authors designated FP regulatory protein (FPRP),
inhibits binding of PGF(2-alpha) to PTGFR. Histologically, FPRP showed a
distribution coinciding well with those cells and tissues that respond
to PGF(2-alpha).

By screening cDNA libraries for sequences with the potential to encode
large proteins expressed in brain, Nagase et al. (2000) identified a
cDNA encoding FPRP, which they termed KIAA1436. The deduced 924-amino
acid protein was predicted to be 89% identical to rat Fprp. RT-PCR
analysis detected wide expression that was highest in ovary and lung.

By mass spectrometric and flow cytometric analyses of an
immunoprecipitated protein, CD9P1, that interacts with CD9 (143030) and
is expressed in HeLa cells, Charrin et al. (2001) determined that CD9P1
is identical to KIAA1436. SDS-PAGE analysis showed expression of a
135-kD protein under reducing conditions, which was lowered to 125 kD
and 106 kD by sialidase and N-glycanase treatments, respectively.
Further immunoprecipitation analysis showed that CD9P1 interacts with
CD81 (186845). Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated expression in
keratinocytes and, faintly, in salivary glands, but not in other
tissues. In contrast, CD9P1 was strongly expressed in a number of cancer
cell lines, suggesting a possible upregulation during tumorigenesis.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Stipp et al. (2001) used moderately stringent Brij96/97 detergent
extraction to show that FPRP associates specifically with CD81 and CD9
but not with other tetraspanin molecules, such as CD151 (602243). They
determined that nearly all cell surface FPRP is associated with CD9 and
CD81.

MAPPING

Orlicky et al. (1996) subcloned and sequenced a portion of the 3-prime
untranslated region of the human homolog to FPRP, and oligonucleotide
primers were designed that allowed PCR amplification specifically of the
human FPRP sequence. Using these primers for PCR-based mapping, the FPRP
gene was localized to chromosome 1 through analysis of human/rodent
somatic cell hybrids and to 1p13.1-q21.3 by analysis of YAC pools.
