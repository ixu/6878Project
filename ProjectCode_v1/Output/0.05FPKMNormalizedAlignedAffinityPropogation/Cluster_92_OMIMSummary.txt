DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Ubiquitin (191339) targets proteins for degradation by the 26S
proteasome (see 603146). In contrast, ubiquitin-like (UBL) proteins
(e.g., UBL1; 601912) may not be directly involved in protein
degradation, but appear to have a diverse range of cellular functions
(review by Hodges et al., 1998). Chadwick et al. (1999) identified the
Drosophila UBL3 gene. By searching an EST database using a Drosophila
UBL3 cDNA as the query, they identified a human UBL3 EST. Using the EST,
they isolated human keratinocyte stem cell cDNAs representing the
complete UBL3 coding sequence. The deduced 117-amino acid human UBL3
protein contains 2 potential N-glycosylation sites, a potential protein
kinase C phosphorylation site, and a potential C-terminal prenylation
site. It is relatively hydrophilic with no predicted transmembrane
domains. Human UBL3 shares 69% amino acid sequence identity with 1 form
of Drosophila UBL3 and 99% identity with mouse Ubl3, a cDNA of which
Chadwick et al. (1999) also isolated. Northern blot analysis of human
tissues detected 3.5- and 4.5-kb UBL3 transcripts in all tissues tested,
namely spleen, thymus, peripheral blood leukocytes, testis, ovary,
placenta, prostate, liver, pancreas, small intestine, colon, kidney,
heart, lung, brain, and skeletal muscle. Additional transcripts of 2.0
and 3.0 kb were found in testis. Chadwick et al. (1999) identified 3
polyadenylation signals that result in alternatively polyadenylated UBL3
transcripts.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid mapping, Chadwick et al. (1999) mapped the human
UBL3 gene to chromosome 13. They localized the UBL3 gene to 13q12-q13
using radiation hybrid mapping. Using FISH, Chadwick et al. (1999)
mapped the mouse Ubl3 gene to the telomeric end of chromosome 5 in band
G2-3, a region showing homology of synteny with human 13q.

164790	TITLE *164790 NEUROBLASTOMA RAS VIRAL ONCOGENE HOMOLOG; NRAS
;;ONCOGENE NRAS; NRAS1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Marshall et al. (1982) identified a gene with transforming activity in 2
different human sarcoma cell lines, a fibrosarcoma (HT1080) and an
embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (RD). Hall et al. (1983) identified this gene
as a member of the RAS gene family and designated it N-RAS 'after
consultation with Wigler and with Weinberg.' They found that NRAS was
also activated in a promyelocytic leukemia cell line (HL60) and a
neuroblastoma cell line (SK-H-SH). NRAS was present at the same levels
in normal fibroblasts and tumor cells. Hall and Brown (1985) identified
2 main NRAS transcripts of 4.3 kb and 2 kb.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hall and Brown (1985) determined that the NRAS gene contains 7 exons.

MAPPING

By restriction mapping and Southern blot analysis, Hall et al. (1983)
mapped the NRAS gene to chromosome 1. By in situ hybridization, Davis et
al. (1983) assigned the NRAS gene to the short arm of chromosome 1. A
concentration of grains was observed just above the centromere in band
1p13. They commented on the wide dispersion of the oncogenes in the RAS
family; each of the 5 mapped to date was on a separate chromosome. Ryan
et al. (1983) confirmed assignment of HRAS (190020) to chromosome 11,
KRAS2 (190070) to chromosome 12, and NRAS to chromosome 1. Addendum in
proof indicated that the same laboratory had assigned NRAS1 to 1p21-cen.
De Martinville et al. (1984) assigned NRAS to 1p31-cen. By somatic cell
hybrid studies and by in situ hybridization, Rabin et al. (1984)
assigned the NRAS gene to 1p13-p11. By in situ hybridization, Popescu et
al. (1985) also assigned the NRAS locus to 1p13-p11. Povey et al. (1985)
reviewed the conflicting evidence on the site of NRAS on 1p. They found
evidence favoring both 1p22 and 1p12-p11. Dracopoli and Meisler (1990)
concluded from linkage analysis and pulsed field gel electrophoresis
that TSHB (188540), NGFB (162030), and NRAS form a tightly linked gene
cluster located in the same chromosomal band. Their location proximal to
the AMY2B gene in 1p21 and close linkage to the alpha-satellite
centromeric repeat D1Z5 provided strong evidence that the correct
assignment for these 3 loci is 1p13 and not 1p22. Mitchell et al. (1995)
localized NRAS to 1p13.2 and CD2 (186990) and NGFB to 1p13.1. They
concluded that the order is as follows: cen--CD2--NGFB--NRAS--tel.

Using teratomas (see 166950) as a means of 'centromere mapping,' Deka et
al. (1989) estimated the NRAS-centromere distance (y) to be 0.30.

GENE FUNCTION

Substitution of ser17 with asn (S17N) in any of the RAS proteins
produces dominant-inhibitory proteins with higher affinities for
exchange factors than normal RAS. These mutants cannot interact with
downstream effectors and therefore form unproductive complexes,
preventing activation of endogenous RAS. Using experiments in COS-7
cells, mouse fibroblasts, and canine kidney cells, Matallanas et al.
(2003) found that the Hras, Kras, and Nras S17N mutants exhibited
distinct inhibitory effects that appeared to be due largely to their
specific membrane localizations. The authors demonstrated that Hras is
present in caveolae, lipid rafts, and bulk disordered membranes, whereas
Kras and Nras are present primarily in disordered membranes and lipid
rafts, respectively. Thus, the Hras S17N mutant inhibited activation of
all 3 wildtype RAS isoforms, the Kras S17N mutant inhibited wildtype
Kras and the portion of Hras in disordered membranes, and the Nras S17N
mutant inhibited wildtype Nras and the portion of Hras in lipid rafts.

Rocks et al. (2005) showed that the specific subcellular distribution of
HRAS and NRAS guanosine triphosphate-binding proteins is generated by a
constitutive de/reacylation cycle that operates on palmitoylated
proteins, driving their rapid exchange between the plasma membrane and
the Golgi apparatus. Depalmitoylation redistributes farnesylated Ras in
all membranes, followed by repalmitoylation and trapping of Ras at the
Golgi, from where it is redirected to the plasma membrane via the
secretory pathway. This continuous cycle prevents Ras from nonspecific
residence on endomembranes, thereby maintaining the specific
intracellular compartmentalization. Rocks et al. (2005) found that the
de/reacylation cycle also initiates Ras activation at the Golgi by
transport of plasma membrane-localized Ras guanosine triphosphate.
Different de/repalmitoylation kinetics account for isoform-specific
activation responses to growth factors.

Haigis et al. (2008) used genetically engineered mice to determine
whether and how the related oncogenes Kras (190070) and Nras regulate
homeostasis and tumorigenesis in the colon. Expression of Kras(G12D) in
the colonic epithelium stimulated hyperproliferation in a Mek (see
176872)-dependent manner. Nras(G12D) did not alter the growth properties
of the epithelium, but was able to confer resistance to apoptosis. In
the context of an Apc (611731)-mutant colonic tumor, activation of Kras
led to defects in terminal differentiation and expansion of putative
stem cells within the tumor epithelium. This Kras tumor phenotype was
associated with attenuated signaling through the MAPK pathway (see
176872), and human colon cancer cells expressing mutant Kras were
hypersensitive to inhibition of Raf (see 164760) but not Mek. Haigis et
al. (2008) concluded that their studies demonstrated clear phenotypic
differences between mutant Kras and Nras, and suggested that the
oncogenic phenotype of mutant Kras might be mediated by noncanonical
signaling through Ras effector pathways.

Nazarian et al. (2010) showed that acquired resistance of BRAF(V600E)
(164757.0001)-positive melanomas to PLX4032, a novel class I
RAF-selective inhibitor, develops by mutually exclusive PDGFRB (173410)
upregulation or NRAS mutations but not through secondary mutations in
BRAF(V600E). Nazarian et al. (2010) used PLX4032-resistant sublines
artificially derived from BRAF(V600E)-positive melanoma cell lines and
validated key findings in PLX4032-resistant tumors and tumor-matched,
short-term cultures from clinical trial patients. Induction of PDGFRB
RNA, protein, and tyrosine phosphorylation emerged as a dominant feature
of acquired PLX4032 resistance in a subset of melanoma sublines,
patient-derived biopsies, and short-term cultures. PDGFRB-upregulated
tumor cells had low activated RAS levels and, when treated with PLX4032,
did not reactivate the MAPK (see 176872) pathway significantly. In
another subset, high levels of activated NRAS resulting from mutations
led to significant MAPK pathway reactivation upon PLX4032 treatment.
Knockdown of PDGFRB or NRAS reduced growth of the respective
PLX4032-resistant subsets. Overexpression of PDGFRB or mutated NRAS
conferred PLX4032 resistance to PLX4032-sensitive parental cell lines.
Importantly, Nazarian et al. (2010) showed that MAPK reactivation
predicts MEK inhibitor sensitivity. Thus, Nazarian et al. (2010)
concluded that melanomas escape BRAF(V600E) targeting not through
secondary BRAF(V600E) mutations but via receptor tyrosine kinase
(RTK)-mediated activation of alternative survival pathway(s) or
activated RAS-mediated reactivation of the MAPK pathway, suggesting
additional therapeutic strategies.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Role in Carcinoma

Using the allele-specific amplification method (ARMS), a highly
sensitive 1-stage allele-specific PCR, Bezieau et al. (2001) evaluated
the incidence of NRAS- and KRAS2-activating mutations (in codons 12, 13,
and 61) in 62 patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined
significance (MGUS), multiple myeloma (MM), or primary plasma cell
leukemia (PPCL), and in human myeloma cell lines (HMCL). Mutations in
one or the other gene, or in both, were found in 54.5% of MM patients at
diagnosis (but in 81% at the time of relapse), 50% of PPCL patients, and
50% of 16 HMCL patients. In contrast, the occurrence of such mutations
was very low in MGUS and indolent MM (12.5%). KRAS2 mutations were
always more frequent than NRAS mutations. Bezieau et al. (2001)
concluded that these early mutations may play a major role in the
oncogenesis of multiple myeloid myeloma and primary plasma cell
leukemia.

Vasko et al. (2003) performed a pooled analysis of 269 mutations in
HRAS, KRAS, and NRAS garnered from 39 previous studies. Mutations proved
significantly less frequent when detected with direct sequencing than
without (12.3% vs 17%). The rates of mutation involving NRAS exon 1 and
KRAS exon 2 was less than 1%. Mutations of codon 61 of NRAS were
significantly more frequent in follicular tumors (19%) than in papillary
cancers (5%) and significantly more frequent in malignant (25%) than in
benign (14%) tumors. HRAS mutations in codons 12/13 were found in 2 to
3% of all types of tumors, but HRAS mutations in codon 61 were observed
in only 1.4% of tumors, and almost all of them were malignant. KRAS
mutations in exon 1 were found more often in papillary than follicular
cancers (2.7% vs 1.6%) and were sometimes correlated with special
epidemiologic circumstances. The second part of this study involved
analysis of 80 follicular tumors from patients living in Marseille
(France) and Kiev (Ukraine). HRAS mutations in codons 12/13 were found
in 12.5% of common adenomas and 1 follicular carcinoma (2.9%). Mutations
of codon 61 of NRAS occurred in 23.3% and 17.6% of atypical adenomas and
follicular carcinomas, respectively. The authors concluded that their
results confirmed the predominance of mutations of codon 61 of NRAS in
thyroid follicular tumors and their correlation with malignancy.

Nikiforova et al. (2003) analyzed a series of 88 conventional follicular
and Hurthle cell thyroid tumors for RAS (HRAS, NRAS, or KRAS) mutations
and PAX8 (167415)-PPARG (601487) rearrangements using molecular methods
and for galectin-3 (153619) and mesothelioma antibody HBME-1 expression
by immunohistochemistry. Forty-nine percent of conventional follicular
carcinomas had RAS mutations, 36% had PAX8-PPARG rearrangement, and only
1 (3%) had both. Of follicular adenomas, 48% had RAS mutations, 4% had
PAX8-PPARG rearrangement, and 48% had neither. Follicular carcinomas
with RAS mutations most often displayed an
HBME-1-positive/galectin-3-negative immunophenotype and were either
minimally or overtly invasive. Hurthle cell tumors infrequently had
PAX8-PPARG rearrangement or RAS mutations.

Johnson et al. (2005) found that the 3 human RAS genes, HRAS KRAS, and
NRAS, contain multiple let-7 (see 605386) miRNA complementary sites in
their 3-prime UTRs that allow let-7 miRNA to regulate their expression.
Let-7 expression was lower in lung tumors than in normal lung tissue,
whereas expression of the RAS proteins was significantly higher in lung
tumors, suggesting a possible mechanism for let-7 in cancer.

The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network (2013) analyzed the genomes of
200 clinically annotated adult cases of de novo AML, using either
whole-genome sequencing (50 cases) or whole-exome sequencing (150
cases), along with RNA and microRNA sequencing and DNA methylation
analysis. The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network (2013) identified
recurrent mutations in the NRAS or KRAS genes in 23/200 (12%) samples.

- Autoimmune Lymphoproliferative Syndrome, Type IV

Oliveira et al. (2007) identified a heterozygous germline mutation in
the NRAS gene (G13D; 164790.0003) in a 49-year-old patient with an
atypical autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome, which they designated
type IV (ALPS4; 614470). The patient had a lifelong overexpansion of
lymphocytes, childhood leukemia, and early adulthood lymphoma, both
successfully treated. He had increased serum alpha/beta-positive,
CD4-/CD8- T cells and follicular hyperplasia of the lymph nodes.

- Noonan Syndrome 6

Cirstea et al. (2010) identified 1 of 2 different heterozygous mutations
in the NRAS gene (T50I; 164790.0004 and G60E; 164790.0005) in 5
patients, including a mother and son, with Noonan syndrome-6 (NS6;
613224). The mutations were de novo in 3 patients. In vitro functional
expression studies showed that the mutations resulted in enhanced
stimulus-dependent MAPK activation. The patients were part of a larger
study of 917 affected individuals who were negative for previously known
Noonan-associated gene mutations, suggesting that NRAS mutations are a
rare cause of Noonan syndrome.

ANIMAL MODEL

Mutations in the RB1 gene (614041) predispose humans and mice to tumor
development. Takahashi et al. (2006) assessed the effect of Nras loss on
tumor development in Rb1 heterozygous mice. Loss of 1 or 2 Nras alleles
significantly reduced the severity of pituitary tumors arising in Rb1
+/- animals by enhancing their differentiation. By contrast, C-cell
thyroid adenomas occurring in Rb1 +/- mice progressed to metastatic
medullary carcinomas after loss of Nras. In Rb1/Nras doubly heterozygous
mice, distant medullary thyroid carcinoma metastases were associated
with loss of the remaining wildtype Nras allele. Loss of Nras in
Rb1-deficient C cells resulted in elevated Ras homolog family A (RhoA)
activity, and this was causally linked to the invasiveness and
metastatic behavior of these cells. These findings suggested that the
loss of the protooncogene Nras in certain cellular contexts can promote
malignant tumor progression.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
RECTAL CANCER, SOMATIC
NRAS, GLY13ARG

Nitta et al. (1987) found a G-to-C point mutation at the first letter of
codon 13 in the NRAS gene as the presumed basis for activation of the
gene in a case of rectal cancer (see 114500). The point mutation
resulted in the substitution of arginine for glycine.

.0002
THYROID CARCINOMA, FOLLICULAR, SOMATIC
EPIDERMAL NEVUS, SOMATIC, INCLUDED
NRAS, GLN61ARG

Nikiforova et al. (2003) found that the CAA-CGA mutation of NRAS codon
61, resulting in a gln-to-arg change (Q61R), was present in 70% (12) of
follicular carcinomas (188470) and 55% (6) of follicular adenomas
studied.

Hafner et al. (2012) identified a somatic Q61R mutation in 1 of 72
keratinocytic epidermal nevi (162900).

.0003
AUTOIMMUNE LYMPHOPROLIFERATIVE SYNDROME, TYPE IV
JUVENILE MYELOMONOCYTIC LEUKEMIA, INCLUDED;;
NOONAN SYNDROME 6, INCLUDED
NRAS, GLY13ASP

Oliveira et al. (2007) identified a heterozygous G-to-A transition in
the NRAS gene, resulting in a gly13-to-asp (G13D) substitution, in a
49-year-old patient with autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS4;
614470). The patient had a lifelong overexpansion of lymphocytes and a
history of childhood leukemia, and early adulthood lymphoma, both
successfully treated. There were no developmental defects. Laboratory
studies showed increased serum alpha/beta, CD4-/CD8- T cells and lymph
node follicular hyperplasia. There was no evidence of CD95
(134637)-mediated apoptosis, but the patient's lymphocytes resisted
death by IL2 (147680) withdrawal, indicating a specific defect in
lymphocyte apoptosis. Further studies of the patient's cells indicated a
decrease of the proapoptotic protein BIM (BCL2L11; 603827), which is
critical for withdrawal-induced mitochondrial apoptosis. In vitro
functional expression studies showed that the G13D mutation resulted in
increased activation of NRAS. Oliveira et al. (2007) noted that the same
mutation had been identified somatically in myeloid and lymphoid
malignancies (Bos et al., 1985; Lubbert et al., 1990).

De Filippi et al. (2009) identified a de novo germline heterozygous G13D
substitution in the NRAS gene in a male infant who presented at age 2
months with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML; 607785) and was
later noted to have dysmorphic features suggestive of, but not
diagnostic of, Noonan syndrome (NS6; 613224). Features included short
stature, relative macrocephaly, high forehead, epicanthal folds, long
eyebrows, low nasal bridge, low-set ears, 2 cafe-au-lait spots, and low
scores on performance tasks. Cardiac studies were normal. There were no
hematologic abnormalities related to ALPS in this patient.

.0004
NOONAN SYNDROME 6
NRAS, THR50ILE

In 2 unrelated boys with Noonan syndrome-6 (613224), Cirstea et al.
(2010) identified a de novo heterozygous 149C-T transition in exon 3 of
the NRAS gene, resulting in a thr50-to-ile (T50I) substitution in a
conserved residue located in the beta-2-beta-3 loop connecting the 2
switch regions. In vitro functional expression studies showed that the
mutant protein resulted in enhanced downstream phosphorylation in the
presence of serum, but did not substantially affect intrinsic GTPase
activity. Molecular modeling indicated that thr50 interacts with the
polar heads of membrane phospholipids and is an integral part of a
region that controls RAS membrane orientation. Cirstea et al. (2010)
hypothesized that the T50I substitution might alter RAS orientation,
increase the interaction of GTP-bound RAS with its effectors, and
enhance a downstream signal flow consistent with a gain of function.

.0005
NOONAN SYNDROME 6
NRAS, GLY60GLU

In 3 patients from 2 unrelated families with Noonan syndrome-6 (613224),
Cirstea et al. (2010) identified a heterozygous 179G-A transition in
exon 3 of the NRAS gene, resulting in a gly60-to-glu (G60E) substitution
in a conserved residue in the switch 2 region. One proband had a de novo
mutation, whereas the other inherited it from his affected mother. In
vitro functional expression studies showed that the mutant protein
resulted in enhanced downstream phosphorylation in the presence of
serum, and that the G60E mutant NRAS protein accumulated constitutively
in the active GTP-bound form, although it appeared to be resistant to
GAP stimulation.

.0006
EPIDERMAL NEVUS, SOMATIC
NRAS, PRO34LEU

Hafner et al. (2012) identified a somatic pro34-to-leu (P34L) mutation
in the NRAS gene in 1 of 72 keratinocytic epidermal nevi (162900).

.0007
EPIDERMAL NEVUS, SOMATIC
NRAS, GLY12ASP

Hafner et al. (2012) identified a somatic gly12-to-asp (G12D) mutation
in the NRAS gene in 1 of 72 keratinocytic epidermal nevi (162900).

615262	TITLE *615262 METHYLTRANSFERASE-LIKE 23; METTL23
;;CHROMOSOME 17 OPEN READING FRAME 95; C17ORF95
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Methyltransferases catalyze the transfer of a methyl group from a donor,
generally S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet), to acceptor molecules,
including proteins, DNA, RNA, lipids, and small metabolites. METTL23
belongs to a family of protein lysine methyltransferases that methylate
nonhistone proteins (Cloutier et al., 2013).

CLONING

By searching databases for sequences similar to METTL22 (615261),
Cloutier et al. (2013) identified METTL23. The deduced protein is made
up predominantly of a Rossmann fold of alternating beta strands and
alpha helices, with a conserved AdoMet-binding site near the N terminus.
Epitope-tagged METTL23 was predominantly expressed in cytoplasmic
membrane-like structures in transfected HeLa cells.

GENE FUNCTION

By affinity purification, SDS-PAGE, and mass spectrometry, Cloutier et
al. (2013) found that METTL23 expressed in HEK293 cells interacted with
HSPA5 (138120), tubulin (see 602529), and UGGT1 (605897). UGGT2 (605898)
and HSP90B1 (191175) were also detected in the immunoprecipitate.

MAPPING

Hartz (2013) mapped the METTL23 gene to chromosome 17q25.1 based on an
alignment of the METTL23 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC033998) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

610378	TITLE *610378 GLIS FAMILY ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 1; GLIS1
;;GLI-SIMILAR PROTEIN 1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

GLIS1 is a GLI (165220)-related Kruppel-like zinc finger protein that
functions as an activator and repressor of transcription (Kim et al.,
2002).

CLONING

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis with the ligand-binding domain of nuclear
orphan receptor ROR-gamma (RORC; 602943) as bait, Kim et al. (2002)
obtained a partial Glis1 cDNA from a mouse lymphoma cDNA library. Using
this fragment to screen a mouse kidney cDNA library, followed by PCR and
5-prime RACE, they cloned full-length Glis1. The deduced 789-amino acid
protein contains a bipartite nuclear localization signal, a proline-rich
region, and a zinc finger domain consisting of 5 tandem C2H2-type zinc
finger motifs. Northern blot analysis of mouse tissues detected highest
expression of Glis1 in placenta and kidney, lower expression in testis,
and little expression in other tissues examined. RT-PCR analysis
detected high expression in kidney, low expression in brain, colon,
brown fat, testis, and thymus, and no expression in lung, spleen, liver,
pancreas, and muscle, In situ hybridization of mouse embryos showed that
Glis1 was expressed primarily in the mesodermal lineages, including
craniofacial regions, branchial arches, somites, vibrissal and hair
follicles, limb buds, and myotomes. By confocal microscopy of monkey
kidney fibroblast CV1 cells expressing full-length and mutant mouse
Glis1, Kim et al. (2002) localized Glis1 to the nucleus in a speckled
pattern similar to that observed for many transcription factors.

GENE FUNCTION

By EMSA analysis, Kim et al. (2002) showed that mouse Glis1 is able to
bind oligonucleotides containing the Gli-binding site consensus
sequence.

Using monohybrid and deletion analyses, Kim et al. (2002) showed that
Glis1 contains a strong activation domain in the C terminus and a
repressor domain in the N terminus. Glis1-mediated transactivation
activity varied among different cell lines tested, and Kim et al. (2002)
suggested that these differences may be related to different levels of
expression or activation of Glis1 coactivators. By cotransfection of
Glis1 and CaMKiV (CAMK4; 114080), Kim et al. (2002) showed that CAMK4
stimulates Glis1 transactivation activity.

By in situ hybridization analysis, Nakanishi et al. (2006) showed that
Glis1 mRNA is not expressed in normal human epidermis or in normal mouse
skin, but is highly induced in the epidermis of psoriatic patients and
in PMA-treated mouse skin. GLIS1 expression was undetectable in human
epidermal keratinocytes but increased significantly after treatment with
proinflammatory agents PMA or interferon-gamma (IFNG; 147570). PMA
induction of GLIS1 expression was cell type-specific and confined to
cell types in which PMA induction is accompanied by cell
differentiation. Nakanishi et al. (2006) showed that in human
keratinocytes immortalized by HPV-E6, full-length mouse Glis1 localized
to the cytoplasm and a C-terminal truncated form of Glis1 that retains
the zinc finger domain localized to the nucleus. By microarray analysis
of a human epidermal keratinocyte cell line expressing the C-terminal
truncated form of mouse Glis1, Nakanishi et al. (2006) found that Glis1
induced several genes known to be differentially regulated during
epidermal differentiation, including S100A9 (123886), KLK7 (604438),
SPRR/cornifin (SPRR1B; 182266), involucrin (IVL; 147360), and
transglutaminase-1 (TGM1; 190195). Nakanishi et al. (2006) suggested
that Glis1 may play a role in the aberrant differentiation observed in
psoriatic epidermis.

Maekawa et al. (2011) showed that Glis1 markedly enhances the generation
of induced pluripotent stem cells (IPSCs) from both mouse and human
fibroblasts when it is expressed together with Oct3/4 (164177), Sox2
(184429), and Klf4 (602253). Mouse IPSCs generated using this
combination of transcription factors can form germline-competent
chimeras. Glis1 is enriched in unfertilized oocytes and in embryos at
the 1-cell stage. DNA microarray analyses show that Glis1 promotes
multiple pro-reprogramming pathways, including Myc (190080), Nanog
(607937), Lin28 (611043), Wnt (see 606359), Esrrb (602167), and the
mesenchymal-epithelial transition. Maekawa et al. (2011) concluded that
Glis1 effectively promotes the direct reprogramming of somatic cells
during iPSC generation.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the GLIS1
gene to chromosome 1 (TMAP SHGC-34268). By FISH, Kim et al. (2002)
mapped the mouse Glis1 gene to chromosome 4C6.

610848	TITLE *610848 RAB15 EFFECTOR PROTEIN; REP15
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

REP15 is a binding partner of the RAB GTPase family member RAB15 that
facilitates transferrin receptor (TFRC; 190010) recycling from the
endocytic recycling compartment (Strick and Elferink, 2005).

CLONING

Using a RAB15 GTP-bound mutant as bait to screen a yeast 2-hybrid HeLa
cell cDNA library, Strick and Elferink (2005) cloned REP15. The deduced
233-amino acid protein shares 73.8% identity with the predicted mouse
ortholog. By cell fractionation, biochemical, and Western blot analysis,
they localized REP15 to endocytic membrane and cytosolic fractions in
HeLa cells and suggested that REP15 has membrane-binding properties that
involve protein-protein interactions. Confocal microscopy colocalized
REP15 and RAB15 to the perinuclear region of HeLa cells. Sucrose
gradient cell fractionation and organelle-specific immunoprecipitation
experiments showed that REP15 coprecipitated with RAB11 (RAB11A; 605570)
and TFRC but did not associate with early endosomal marker EEA1
(605070). Strick and Elferink (2005) concluded that REP15 localized
specifically to the endocytic recycling compartment (ERC) and excluded
REP15 from sorting endosomes.

GENE FUNCTION

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis and GST pull-down studies, Strick and
Elferink (2005) showed that REP15 specifically binds to GTP-bound forms
of RAB15. REP15 did not bind GDP-bound or nucleotide-free RAB15 mutant
forms, nor did it bind another GTPase RAB5 (RAB5A; 179512). Yeast
2-hybrid analysis with REP15 deletion mutants and RAB15 showed no
interaction, suggesting that REP15 interaction with RAB15 may require
multiple binding sites or a structural motif requiring full-length
REP15. Overexpression of REP15 in HeLa cells resulted in higher levels
of internalized TFRC with reduction of cell surface TFRC levels, and
siRNA-knockdown of REP15 blocked TFRC recycling from the ERC.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the REP15
gene to chromosome 12 (TMAP RH99304).

606592	TITLE *606592 VANIN 3; VNN3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By EST database analysis, Granjeaud et al. (1999) identified a novel
human VNN gene, VNN3. Martin et al. (2001) cloned a full-length VNN3
cDNA encoding a deduced 501-amino acid protein with strong similarity to
the mouse vnn3 molecule. Both the mouse and human proteins lack the
GPI-anchor motif found in VNN1 (603570) and VNN2 (603571). Northern blot
analysis detected a 1.8-kb VNN3 mRNA in human liver, placenta, and
peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs). A 3.8-kb mRNA was observed in PBLs.

GENE FUNCTION

Martin et al. (2001) found that all vanin proteins are ectoenzymes with
pantetheinase activity. They showed that mouse vanin-3 and, by analogy,
human VNN3 are secreted molecules.

GENE STRUCTURE

Martin et al. (2001) determined that the human VNN1, VNN2, and VNN3
genes, as well as the mouse vnn1 and vnn3 genes, all contain 7 exons.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Martin et al. (2001) mapped the VNN3 gene to human
chromosome 6q23-q24 and mouse chromosome 10 in a cluster with VNN1 and
VNN2. All 3 genes are aligned in the same transcriptional orientation.

187680	TITLE *187680 THIOPURINE S-METHYLTRANSFERASE; TPMT
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT; S-adenosyl-L-methionine:thiopurine
S-methyltransferase; EC 2.1.1.67) catalyzes the S-methylation of
aromatic and heterocyclic sulfhydryl compounds, including the
antineoplastic agents 6-mercaptopurine (6MP) and 6-thioguanine (6TG),
and the immunosuppressant azathioprine (AZA) (Tai et al., 1996).

CLONING

Honchel et al. (1993) isolated a cDNA corresponding to the TPMT gene
from a T84 human colon carcinoma cell cDNA library. The deduced
245-amino acid protein has a molecular mass of 35 kD. COS-1 cells
transfected with the cDNA expressed a high level of TPMT enzyme
activity.

GENE STRUCTURE

Szumlanski et al. (1996) determined that the TPMT gene is 34 kb long and
contains 10 exons.

By screening of a phage artificial chromosome library, Krynetski et al.
(1997) isolated clones corresponding to human TPMT, which they
determined spanned 25 kb and contained 9 exons. Differences from the
previously reported gene structure included 17 additional nucleotides
upstream from the transcription start site and a shorter intron 8.

Seki et al. (2000) determined that the TPMT gene spans 27 kb and
contains 9 exons; they did not identify intron 2 reported by Szumlanski
et al. (1996).

MAPPING

Szumlanski et al. (1996) mapped the TPMT gene to chromosome 6 by
analysis of human/rodent somatic cell hybrids and sublocalized it to
6p22.3 by fluorescence in situ hybridization.

- Pseudogene

Lee et al. (1995) identified a processed TPMT pseudogene located on
chromosome 18q21.1.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

TPMT activity exhibits genetic heterogeneity due to polymorphisms in the
TPMT gene. Weinshilboum and Sladek (1980) found trimodality for red cell
TPMT activity among 298 randomly selected subjects: 88.6% had high
enzyme activity, 11.1% had intermediate activity, and 0.3% had
undetectable activity. This distribution conformed to Hardy-Weinberg
expectations for a pair of autosomal codominant alleles for low and high
activity, TPMT-L and TPMT-H, with frequencies of 0.059 and 0.941,
respectively. Segregation in families ascertained through probands with
undetectable activity was consistent with this hypothesis.

Klemetsdal et al. (1993) found that red blood cell TPMT activity was
8.3% higher in healthy males compared to females.

Cheng et al. (2005) used polymorphisms in the genes encoding TPMT,
gamma-glutamyl hydrolase (GGH; 601509) and the reduced folate carrier
(SLC19A1; 600424) to assess the nature of chromosomal acquisition and
its influence on genotype-phenotype concordance in cancer cells. TPMT
and GGH activities in somatic cells were concordant with germline
genotypes, whereas activities in leukemia cells were determined by
chromosomal number and whether the acquired chromosomes contained a
wildtype or variant allele. Leukemia cells that had acquired an
additional chromosome containing a wildtype TPMT or GGH allele had
significantly lower accumulation of thioguanine nucleotides or
methotrexate polyglutamates, respectively. Among these genes, there was
a considerable number of acquired chromosomes with wildtype and variant
alleles. Cheng et al. (2005) concluded that chromosomal gain can alter
the concordance of germline genotype and cancer cell phenotypes,
indicating that allele-specific quantitative genotyping may be required
to define cancer pharmacogenomics unequivocally.

- Relation of TPMT Activity to Thiopurine Drug Metabolism

The thiopurines are pro-drugs that require extensive metabolism in order
to exert their cytotoxic action. Azathioprine is nonenzymatically
reduced to 6MP. 6MP and 6TG are activated by HPRT (308000) and
subsequent steps to form cytotoxic thioguanine nucleotides (TGNs) which
are incorporated into DNA and/or RNA, causing DNA-protein cross-links,
single-strand breaks, interstrand cross-links, and sister chromatid
exchange. TPMT functions mainly to inactivate these drugs; thus, a
deficiency of TPMT results in increased conversion to toxic TGNs
(Coulthard and Hogarth, 2005). In addition, 6MP is unique in that it can
also be converted via TPMT into a methyl-thioinosine 5-prime
monophosphate (MeTIMP), a metabolite that inhibits de novo purine
synthesis and likely contributes to the cytotoxic effect of 6MP (Vogt et
al., 1993; Krynetski et al., 1995; Coulthard and Hogarth, 2005).

In an 8-year-old girl with TPMT deficiency (610460) who developed severe
hematopoietic toxicity with conventional oral doses of 6MP for treatment
of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (Evans et al., 1991), Krynetski et
al. (1995) identified a mutation in the TPMT gene, referred to as
variant TPMT*2 (A80P; 187680.0001). The mutation was heterozygous in
both the proposita and her mother and absent in the father. The authors
concluded that the patient had a second inactivating mutation. Krynetski
et al. (1995) commented that a reliable method to determine TPMT
genotype is important, given the potentially fatal nature of
hematopoietic toxicity when full doses of mercaptopurine or azathioprine
are given to TPMT-deficient patients.

In 4 individuals with decreased TPMT activity, Szumlanski et al. (1996)
identified homozygosity for a complex TPMT allele, referred to as
TPMT*3A (A154T and Y240C; 187680.0002). TPMT*3A is the most common
mutant TPMT allele among Caucasians (Tai et al., 1996). Tai et al.
(1997) showed that enhanced degradation of TPMT proteins encoded by the
TPMT*2 (187680.0001) and TPMT*3A alleles is the mechanism for lower TPMT
protein and catalytic activity conferred by these mutants.

In a 14-year-old girl who developed severe pancytopenia after starting
AZA for HLA-B27-associated juvenile spondylarthritis (106300), Liepold
et al. (1997) identified homozygosity for the TPMT*3A allele. Family
studies showed that the mother was also homozygous for the deficiency
while other family members were heterozygous. In a patient with
AZA-induced myelosuppression after renal transplant, Kurzawski et al.
(2005) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 variants in the TPMT
gene (TPMT*3A and TPMT*3C; 187680.0005).

Stanulla et al. (2005) stated that 20 TPMT variant alleles,
TPMT*2-TPMT*18, associated with decreased enzyme activity had been
identified. More than 95% of decreased TPMT activity can be explained by
the most frequent mutant alleles TPMT*2 and TPMT*3(A-D).

POPULATION GENETICS

Otterness et al. (1997) described 8 variant alleles for TPMT and their
ethnic differences in frequency.

Among 248 African Americans and 282 Caucasian Americans, Hon et al.
(1999) found that the overall TPMT mutant allele frequencies were
similar, 4.6% and 3.7%, respectively. TPMT*3C was the most prevalent
mutant allele in African Americans (52.2% of mutant alleles), but
represented only 4.8% of mutant alleles in Caucasians. TPMT*3A was the
most prevalent mutant allele in Caucasians (85.7% of mutant alleles),
but represented only 17.4% of mutant alleles in African Americans. Hon
et al. (1999) found a novel allele, designated TPMT*8 (R215H;
187680.0006), in an African American who had intermediate activity.

Ameyaw et al. (1999) identified mutant TPMT alleles in 32 (14.8%) of 217
Ghanaian individuals and 18 (10%) of 199 British Caucasians. All of the
Ghanaian individuals with a mutant allele had TPMT*3C (allele frequency
of 7.6%), whereas only 1 British Caucasian individual had the TPMT*3C
allele (frequency of 0.3%). The other 3 variant alleles were not
detected in any of the Ghanaian samples analyzed. Seventeen of the
British subjects had TPMT*3A (frequency of 4.5%). Phylogenetic analyses
estimate the divergence of Africans and non-Africans to have occurred at
least 100,000 years ago. From gene evolution studies, it is considered
that the most common allele in all populations is usually the ancestral
allele. Mutation and recombination then give rise to the other
genotypes. Ameyaw et al. (1999) concluded that the TPMT*3C mutation may
be the ancestral TPMT mutant allele, as it was present in both Caucasian
and African subjects and had been described in Southwest Asian and
Chinese populations (Collie-Duguid et al., 1999). The TPMT*3B allele was
then acquired and added to form TPMT*3A. Since the TPMT*2 allele appears
to be confined to Caucasians, it may be a more recent allele of this
polymorphic enzyme.

Collie-Duguid et al. (1999) found that the frequency of individuals with
a TPMT variant was 10% (20 of 199) in Caucasians, 2% (2 of 99) in
Southwest Asians, and 4.7% (9 of 192) in Chinese. TPMT*3A was the only
mutant allele found in Southwest Asians (2 heterozygotes) and was the
most common allele in Caucasians (16 heterozygotes and 1 homozygote),
but was not found in Chinese. All mutant alleles in the Chinese were
TPMT*3C (9 heterozygotes). The findings further suggested that TPMT*3C
is the oldest mutation, with TPMT*3B being acquired later to form
TPMT*3A in the Caucasian and Southwest Asian populations.

Using a PCR-SSCP technique to genotype 310 individuals from northern
Portugal. Alves et al. (1999) identified 15 heterozygotes for TPMT*3A;
the corresponding gene frequency estimate was 0.024. Alves et al. (1999)
also identified a silent 474T-C transition (TPMT*1S = 0.215) in this
population.

McLeod et al. (1999) found that the frequency of mutant TPMT alleles was
similar between the Caucasian (10.1%) and Kenyan (10.9%) populations;
however, all mutant alleles in the Kenyan population were TPMT*3C
compared with 4.8% in Caucasians. In contrast, TPMT*3A was the most
common mutant allele in the Caucasian individuals.

Hiratsuka et al. (2000) identified the TPMT*3C allele in 0.8% of 192
Japanese individuals; there were 3 heterozygotes. The TPMT*2, TPMT*3A,
and TPMT*3B alleles were not identified in any of the samples.

Lu et al. (2006) found that the frequency of the TPMT*3C allele was
0.12% and 1.28% in Taiwan aborigines and Taiwanese individuals,
respectively. Other variants, TPMT*2 through TPMT*8, were not
identified.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
THIOPURINE S-METHYLTRANSFERASE DEFICIENCY
TPMT, ALA80PRO

This TPMT variant is referred to as the TPMT*2 allele (Tai et al.,
1996).

In an 8-year-old girl with thiopurine S-methyltransferase deficiency
(610460) originally reported by Evans et al. (1991), Krynetski et al.
(1995) identified a 238G-C transversion in the TPMT gene, resulting in
an ala80-to-pro (A80P) substitution. The patient developed severe
hematologic toxicity after conventional therapy for acute lymphoblastic
leukemia with oral mercaptopurine. Functional expression studies in a
yeast heterologous expression system showed that the A80P mutant enzyme
had a 100-fold reduction in TPMT catalytic activity compared to the
wildtype enzyme, despite a comparable level of mRNA expression. A
mutation-specific PCR amplification method was developed and used to
detect the same mutation in genomic DNA of the proposita and her mother.
Krynetski et al. (1995) concluded that the patient had a second
inactivating mutation.

Tai et al. (1997) showed that the TPMT*2 and TPMT*3A (187680.0002)
mutant proteins showed enhanced degradation, thus resulting in decreased
TPMT protein and catalytic activity.

Ameyaw et al. (1999) identified the TPMT*2 allele in 2 of 199 British
Caucasian individuals (allele frequency of 0.5%) and none of 217
Ghanaian individuals, suggesting that it is restricted to the Caucasian
population.

.0002
THIOPURINE S-METHYLTRANSFERASE DEFICIENCY
TPMT, ALA154THR AND TYR240CYS

This TPMT variant is referred to as TPMT*3A (Tai et al., 1997). See also
TPMT*3B (A154T; 187680.0004) and TPMT*3C (Y240C; 187680.0005).

In 4 individuals with decreased TPMT activity (610460), Szumlanski et
al. (1996) identified homozygosity for 2 mutations in the TPMT gene: a
460G-A transition in exon 7 resulting in an ala154-to-thr (A154T)
substitution, and a 719A-G transition in exon 10 resulting in a
tyr240-to-cys (Y240C) substitution. Three liver samples from individuals
with intermediate TPMT activity were heterozygous for the 2 mutations.
In vitro functional expression studies showed that each mutation
independently, as well as both together, resulted in decreased
expression of TPMT enzymatic activity and immunoreactive protein.

Independently, Tai et al. (1996) identified homozygosity for a mutant
allele carrying the A154T and Y240C substitutions in a TPMT-deficient
patient. Site-directed mutagenesis and heterologous expression
established that either mutation alone resulted in a reduction in
catalytic activity (A154T, 9-fold reduction; Y240C, 1.4-fold reduction),
while the presence of both mutations resulted in complete loss of enzyme
activity.

With mutation-specific PCR-RFLP analysis, Tai et al. (1996) identified
the TPMT*3A mutation in genomic DNA from approximately 75% of unrelated
white subjects with heterozygous TPMT phenotypes, indicating that it is
the most common mutant allele associated with TPMT deficiency.

Tai et al. (1997) showed that the TPMT*2 (187680.0001) and TPMT*3A
mutant proteins showed enhanced degradation, thus resulting in decreased
TPMT protein and catalytic activity.

Ameyaw et al. (1999) identified the TPMT*3A allele in 17 of 199 British
Caucasian individuals (allele frequency of 4.5%) and none of 217
Guanaian individuals.

Hon et al. (1999) identified the TPMT*3A allele in 4 of 248 African
Americans (allele frequency of 0.8%) and 18 of 282 Caucasian Americans
(allele frequency of 3.2%).

Collie-Duguid et al. (1999) found that the TPMT*3A allele was the most
common mutant variant among 199 Caucasian individuals (16 heterozygotes
and 1 homozygote). The mutation was not identified in 192 Chinese
individuals. TPMT*3A was the only mutant allele found in Southwest
Asians (2 heterozygotes in 99 individuals). The findings suggested that
TPMT*3C is the oldest mutation, with TPMT*3B being acquired later to
form TPMT*3A in the Caucasian and Southwest Asian populations.

Liepold et al. (1997) reported a 14-year-old girl who developed severe
pancytopenia 7 weeks after starting azathioprine for HLA-B27-associated
juvenile spondylarthritis (see 106300). She was found to have toxic
levels of 6-thioguanine nucleotides and was TPMT-deficient. Withdrawal
of azathioprine allowed recovery 8 weeks later. Molecular analysis
identified homozygosity for the TPMT*3A allele. Family studies showed
that the mother was also homozygous for the deficiency while other
family members were heterozygous.

In a patient with azathioprine-induced myelosuppression after renal
transplant, Kurzawski et al. (2005) identified compound heterozygosity
for 2 variants in the TPMT gene TPMT*3A and TPMT*3C.

Wang et al. (2005) found that the TPMT*3A protein was ubiquitinated and
formed aggresomes in COS-1 cells. Further analysis indicated that the 2
mutations in TPMT*3A disrupted the protein structure, resulting in
misfolding and aggregation.

.0003
THIOPURINE S-METHYLTRANSFERASE DEFICIENCY
TPMT, IVS9AS, G-A, -1

This TPMT variant is referred to as TPMT*4A (Otterness et al., 1998).

In an individual with thiopurine S-methyltransferase deficiency
(610460), Otterness et al. (1998) identified compound heterozygosity for
2 mutations in the TPMT gene: TPMT*3A (187680.0002) and a new variant
allele, TPMT*4A, caused by a G-to-A transition that disrupted the
acceptor splice junction at the final 3-prime nucleotide of intron 9.
The new allele was found to cosegregate with reduced TPMT activity
within an extended kindred. The mutation was found to lead to generation
of at least 2 aberrant mRNA species. The first resulted from use of a
novel splice site located 1 nucleotide 3-prime downstream from the
original splice junction. This mRNA species contained a single
nucleotide deletion and a frameshift in exon 10, the terminal exon of
the gene. The second novel mRNA species resulted from activation of a
cryptic splice site located within intron 9, leading to inclusion of 330
nucleotides of intron sequence. That sequence contained a premature
translation termination codon. TPMT*4 was the first reported allele for
low TPMT activity as a result of a mutation within an intron.

.0004
THIOPURINE S-METHYLTRANSFERASE DEFICIENCY
TPMT, ALA154THR

This TPMT variant is referred to as the TPMT*3B allele. Together with
TPMT*3C (Y240C; 187680.0005), it forms TPMT*3A (187680.0002).

The TPMT*3B polymorphic variant allele results from a 460G-A transition
in exon 7 of the TPMT gene, resulting in an ala154-to-thr (A154T)
substitution (Szumlanski et al., 1996)

Ameyaw et al. (1999) did not identify the TPMT*3B allele in 217
Ghanaians or 199 British Caucasians, suggesting that it is a rare
variant.

.0005
THIOPURINE S-METHYLTRANSFERASE DEFICIENCY
TPMT, TYR240CYS

This TPMT variant is referred to as TPMT*3C (Ameyaw et al., 1999).
Together with TPMT*3B (A154T; 187680.0004), it forms TPMT*3A
(187680.0002).

The TPMT*3C polymorphic variant allele results from a 719A-G transition
in exon 10 of the TPMT gene, resulting in a tyr240-to-cys (Y240C)
substitution (Szumlanski et al., 1996)

Ameyaw et al. (1999) identified the Y240C substitution in all 32 of 217
Ghanaian individuals with a mutant TPMT allele (allele frequency of
7.6%), and in only 1 of 199 British Caucasian individual with a mutant
TPMT allele (frequency of 0.3%).

Hon et al. (1999) found that TPMT*3C was the most prevalent mutant
allele among 248 African Americans, accounting for 52.2% of mutant
alleles. The overall frequency of the TPMT*3C allele in this population
was 2.4% compared to 0.17% among 282 Caucasian Americans.

Collie-Duguid et al. (1999) found that the TPMT*3C allele accounted for
all variants among a group of Chinese individuals with mutant alleles.
Nine (4.7%) of 192 individuals were heterozygous, whereas only 1 of 199
Caucasians was heterozygous for the allele. The findings suggested that
TPMT*3C is the oldest mutation, with TPMT*3B being acquired later to
form TPMT*3A.

Hiratsuka et al. (2000) and Lu et al. (2006) identified the TPMT*3C
allele as the only mutant TPMT variant among Japanese and Taiwanese
individuals, respectively.

In a Polish patient with azathioprine-induced myelosuppression after
renal transplant caused by TPMT deficiency (610460), Kurzawski et al.
(2005) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 variants in the TPMT
gene: TPMT*3A and TPMT*3C.

.0006
THIOPURINE S-METHYLTRANSFERASE DEFICIENCY
TPMT, ARG215HIS

This TPMT variant is referred to as TPMT*8.

In an African American with intermediate TPMT activity, Hon et al.
(1999) identified a 644G-A transition in exon 10 of the TPMT gene,
resulting in an arg215-to-his (R215H) substitution,

.0007
THIOPURINE S-METHYLTRANSFERASE DEFICIENCY
TPMT, ALA167GLY

This TPMT variant is referred to as TPMT*23.

In a woman with TPMT deficiency (610460), Lindqvist et al. (2007)
identified compound heterozygosity for 2 variant alleles in the TPMT
gene: a 500C-G transversion in exon 8, resulting in an ala167-to-gly
(A167G) substitution, and the common TPMT*3A allele (187680.0002). The
woman's mother and sister had the same genotype; all 3 had extremely low
TPMT activity.

131360	TITLE *131360 ENOLASE 2; ENO2
;;ENOLASE, GAMMA;;
ENOLASE, NEURON-SPECIFIC; NSE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The enolases (phosphopyruvate hydratase; EC 4.2.1.11) catalyze the
interconversion of 2-phosphoglycerate to phosphoenolpyruvate in the
glycolytic pathway. The functional enzyme is a dimer made up of subunits
referred to as alpha, beta, and gamma. In mammals there are at least 3
isoforms of enolase characterized by different tissue distributions as
well as by distinct biochemical and immunologic properties. The gamma-,
or neuron-specific, enolase (ENO2) is the major form found in mature
neurons and in cells of neuronal origin. The alpha-, or nonneuronal,
enolase (ENO1; 172430) is a nearly ubiquitous form, found in almost all
tissues, and its expression precedes that of the other isoforms in the
early stage of embryonic development. The beta-, or muscle-specific,
enolase (ENO3; 131370) is present in adult skeletal muscle (summary by
Oliva et al., 1991).

GENE FUNCTION

Muller et al. (2012) proposed that homozygous deletions in passenger
genes in cancer deletions can expose cancer-specific therapeutic
vulnerabilities when the collaterally deleted gene is a member of a
functionally redundant family of genes carrying out an essential
function. The glycolytic gene ENO1 in the 1p36 locus is deleted in
glioblastoma, which is tolerated by the expression of ENO2. Muller et
al. (2012) showed that short hairpin RNA-mediated silencing of ENO2
selectively inhibits growth, survival, and the tumorigenic potential of
ENO1-deleted GBM cells, and that the enolase inhibitor
phosphonoacetohydroxamate is selectively toxic to ENO1-deleted GBM cells
relative to ENO1-intact GBM cells or normal astrocytes. Muller et al.
(2012) suggested that the principle of collateral vulnerability should
be applicable to other passenger-deleted genes encoding functionally
redundant essential activities and provide an effective treatment
strategy for cancers containing such genomic events.

MAPPING

Enolase-2 is determined by a gene on chromosome 12 (Grzeschik, 1976).
Herbschleb-Voogt et al. (1978) confirmed assignment to chromosome 12 by
showing synteny with LDHB and PEPB in man-mouse hybrids. Mattei et al.
(1982) assigned ENO2 to 12p11-qter by study of cells trisomic for
12pter-p11. Law and Kao (1982) also assigned the gene to chromosome 12.
By in situ hybridization, Craig et al. (1989, 1990) localized ENO2 to
12p13. Oliva et al. (1991) demonstrated that the ENO2 gene contains 12
exons distributed over 9,213 nucleotides. The putative promoter region
lacks canonical TATA and CAAT boxes, is very G+C-rich, and contains
several potential regulatory sequences.

;;SUN DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1;;
UNC84, C. ELEGANS, HOMOLOG OF, A; UNC84A;;
KIAA0810
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SUN1 and SUN2 (613569) are inner nuclear membrane (INM) proteins that
play a major role in nuclear-cytoplasmic connection by formation of a
'bridge' across the nuclear envelope, known as the LINC complex, via
interaction with the conserved luminal KASH domain of nesprins (e.g.,
SYNE1; 608441) located in the outer nuclear membrane (ONM). The LINC
complex provides a direct connection between the nuclear lamina and the
cytoskeleton, which contributes to nuclear positioning and cellular
rigidity (summary by Haque et al., 2010).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) cloned UNC84A, which they called KIAA0810.
The deduced protein contains 824 amino acids. UNC84A shares about 32%
identity over 191 amino acids with Sad1 of Saccharomyces pombe. RT-PCR
ELISA revealed weak to moderate expression in most tissues examined.
Highest expression was detected in heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, and
ovary, and weakest expression was detected in spleen.

By searching databases for homologs of C. elegans Unc84, followed by
5-prime RACE of a brain cDNA library, Malone et al. (1999) cloned human
SUN1 and SUN2. The predicted proteins contain 824 and 724 amino acids,
respectively, and their C termini share homology with the C termini of
C. elegans Unc84 and S. pombe Sad1. Both SUN1 and SUN2 contain a
transmembrane region.

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen with Trax (602964) as bait, Bray et al.
(2002) cloned Unc84a, which they designated Sun1, from a mouse testis
cDNA library. The deduced protein contains 310 amino acids. Overall the
mouse and human proteins share 75% homology, and they share 89% homology
in the C-terminal Sad1/Unc84 (SUN) domain. Northern blot analysis of
mouse tissues detected a 4.3-kb transcript in all tissues examined, with
highest levels in heart, brain, and testis, and a 2.5-kb transcript only
in testis. Northern blot analysis of isolated testicular germ cells
detected the 4.3-kb transcript in pachytene spermatocytes and the 2.5-kb
transcript primarily in postmeiotic cells. Unc84a transfected into
NIH-3T3 mouse fibroblasts showed 2 patterns of distribution. One pattern
was predominantly cytoplasmic with perinuclear accumulation, and the
other exhibited both nuclear and cytoplasmic staining, but no
accumulation in the nucleoli. Bray et al. (2002) noted that these
expression profiles may reflect regulation of expression during the cell
cycle, since the transfected cells were not synchronized.

By peptide mass fingerprint spectra, Dreger et al. (2001) identified
Unc84a in a TX100-resistant fraction of nuclear envelope proteins
isolated from a mouse neuroblastoma cell line. Mouse Unc84a contains a
C2H2 zinc finger domain and 3 to 4 putative transmembrane segments. The
apparent molecular mass of mouse Unc84a is about 100 kD. Indirect
immunofluorescence of transiently transfected COS-7 cells detected
Unc84a fluorescence in a rim-like pattern around the nucleus, typical
for integral inner nuclear membrane proteins.

By immunofluorescence analysis, Ding et al. (2007) found that the
distribution of Sun1 changed during development of mouse spermatids. In
primary spermatocytes, but not in round spermatids, Sun1 colocalized
with telomeres. Sun1 associated with chromosome ends from early
leptotene stage to diplotene stage, including homolog pairing, synapsis,
and desynapsis, but it was absent from telomeres during diakinesis.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis and in vitro binding assays, Bray et al.
(2002) determined that the C terminus of Unc84a interacts directly with
Trax.

Haque et al. (2010) stated that SUN1 and SUN2 interact with lamin A
(LMNA; 150330) and that LMNA is required for the nuclear envelope
localization of SUN2, but not SUN1. By immunoprecipitation of
transfected human osteosarcoma cells and mouse fibroblasts, followed by
in vitro pull-down assays and immunofluorescence microscopy, Haque et
al. (2010) identified emerin (EMD; 300384) and short isoforms of
nesprin-2 (SYNE2; 608442) as novel nucleoplasmic binding partners of
mouse Sun1 and human SUN2. Emerin and nesprin-2 had overlapping binding
sites, distinct from the LMNA-binding site, in Sun1 and SUN2. LMNA
mutations associated with Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy-2 (EDMD2;
181350) and Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS; 176670)
disrupted interaction of LMNA with Sun1 and SUN2. Nuclear localization
of SUN1 and SUN2 was not impaired in EDMD2 or HGPS cell lines.
Expression of SUN1, but not SUN2, at the nuclear envelope was enhanced
in some HGPS cells, likely due to increased interaction of SUN1 with
accumulated prelamin A. Haque et al. (2010) proposed that different
perturbations in LMNA-SUN protein interactions may underlie the opposing
effects of EDMD and HGPS mutations on nuclear and cellular mechanics.

Chen et al. (2012) showed that cells from Lmna -/- mice, which represent
EDMD2, cells from Lmna(L530P/L530P) mice, which represent HGPS, and
cells from HGPS patients all had overaccumulation of the inner nuclear
envelope SUN1 protein. In wildtype cells, Lmna and Sun1 colocalized at
the nuclear envelope. In Lmna -/- cells, larger amounts of Sun1 were
found at the nuclear envelope and also in the Golgi. The larger amounts
of Sun1 appeared to result from reduced protein turnover. Transfection
of increasing amounts of mouse Sun1 into Lmna-null/Sun1-null murine
cells resulted in increased prevalence of nuclear herniations and
apoptosis, and the herniations appeared to result from Sun1 accumulation
in the Golgi. Loss of the Sun1 gene in both mouse models extensively
rescued cellular, tissue, organ, and lifespan abnormalities. Similarly,
knockdown of overaccumulated SUN1 protein in primary human HGPS cells
corrected nuclear defects and cellular senescence. The findings
indicated that accumulation of SUN1 is a common pathogenetic event in
these disorders.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the UNC84A
gene to chromosome 7.

ANIMAL MODEL

Ding et al. (2007) obtained Sun1-null mouse embryos in the expected
mendelian ratio. Both male and female Sun1-null mice developed normally,
but they were sterile. Histologic examination showed that germ cells
were largely depleted in seminiferous tubules of Sun1-null mice.
Spermatids and spermatozoa were completely absent, and only abnormal
spermatocyte-like cells accumulated in some tubules. TUNEL staining
revealed that massive apoptosis accounted for the absence of spermatids
and spermatozoa in Sun1-null testis.

Lei et al. (2009) found that anchorage of skeletal muscle nuclei at
neuromuscular junctions was partially disrupted in Sun1-null mice, but
not in Sun2-null mice. Anchorage of nonsynaptic nuclei was normal in
both Sun1-null mice and Sun2-null mice. Sun1/Sun2 double-knockout mice
died soon after birth, with enhanced loss of synaptic nuclei, disrupted
organization of nonsynaptic nuclei, and mislocalization of Syne1 at
synaptic junctions. Disruption of 3 or all 4 wildtype Sun1 and Sun2
alleles revealed a gene dosage effect on synaptic nuclear anchorage. Lei
et al. (2009) concluded that SUN1 and SUN2 have partially redundant
functions on synaptic nuclear anchorage in skeletal muscle fibers.

Zhang et al. (2009) showed that Sun1 and Sun2 double-knockout (Sun1/2
DKO) mice and Syne1 and Syne2 double-knockout (Syne1/2 DKO) mice had
similar defects in brain development. Sun1/2 DKO and Syne1/2 DKO brains
were small and showed defective laminary structures in many brain
regions. Examination of neocortex revealed failure of radial neuronal
migration, but not tangential migration of interneurons, in both Sun1/2
DKO and Syne1/2 DKO mice. Intracellular movement of nuclei is a
prerequisite for proper neuron migration and development, and Zhang et
al. (2009) found that Sun1 and Sun2 anchored Syne2 to the nuclear
envelope, while Syne1 and Syne2 connected the nuclear envelope to the
microtubule network, permitting nuclear movement. Zhang et al. (2009)
concluded that a complex made up of SUN1, SUN2, SYNE1, and SYNE2 is
required for neuronal nuclear movement and for neuronal migration and
development.

607348	TITLE *607348 HAIRY/ENHANCER OF SPLIT, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, 5; HES5
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Takebayashi et al. (1995) cloned mouse Hes5. Hes5 contains a basic
helix-loop-helix (bHLH) domain that shares 96% identity with the bHLH
region of rat Hes5. In situ hybridization showed that Hes5 was expressed
at high levels throughout the developing mouse central nervous system.
Prominent expression was observed in the wall of embryonic brain
vesicles and in developing spinal cord.

By searching databases using mouse Hes5 as query, Katoh and Katoh (2004)
identified human HES5. The deduced 166-amino acid protein contains an
N-terminal bHLH domain, followed by an orange domain, a proline-rich
domain, and a C-terminal WRPW motif. HES5 ESTs were found in fetal heart
and brain tumor cDNA libraries.

GENE FUNCTION

Using deletion analysis of the mouse Hes5 promoter, Takebayashi et al.
(1995) determined that 2 GC stretches could direct expression of a
reporter plasmid in undifferentiated neural cells. They also found that
expression of Hes5 was reduced upon differentiation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Katoh and Katoh (2004) determined that the HES5 gene contains at least 3
exons.

Takebayashi et al. (1995) determined that the mouse Hes5 gene has 3
exons. The promoter region of the mouse Hes5 gene contains a TATA motif
and multiple GC elements.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Katoh and Katoh (2004) mapped the HES5
gene to chromosome 1p36.32, between the PANK4 (606162) and TNRFSF14
(602746) genes.

603940	TITLE *603940 POTASSIUM CHANNEL, SUBFAMILY K, MEMBER 7; KCNK7
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Members of the tandem pore domain potassium (K2P) channel family, such
as TWIK1 (601745) and TREK (603219), contain 4 transmembrane domains and
2 pore-forming (P) domains. See KCNK6 (603939). By searching an EST
database for sequences related to mouse Kcnk6, Salinas et al. (1999)
isolated a human cDNA encoding a novel potassium channel, which they
designated KCNK7. RT-PCR revealed that exon skipping gives rise to 5
mRNA species encoding 3 protein forms, KCNK7-A, -B, and -C. The
predicted 307-amino acid KCNK7A form is the longest; KCNK7B and KCNK7C
have truncated cytoplasmic C termini. Sequence analysis revealed that
the KCNK7 protein contains 4 potential transmembrane segments and 2 P
domains. The P2 domain contains a very unconventional GLE motif instead
of the GLG found in TWIK1 and KCNK6 or the GFG found in other K2P
channels. The core region spanning the 4 transmembrane domains of KCNK7A
shares 80% and 42% protein sequence identity with those of Kcnk6 and
TWIK1, respectively. As with Kcnk6, none of the KCNK7 protein forms were
able to generate channel activity when expressed in mammalian cells.

MAPPING

By analysis of radiation hybrids, Salinas et al. (1999) mapped the KCNK7
gene to 11q13.

602695	TITLE *602695 TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR LIGAND SUPERFAMILY, MEMBER 12; TNFSF12
;;TNF-RELATED WEAK INDUCER OF APOPTOSIS; TWEAK
TWEAK/APRIL SPLICED READ-THROUGH TRANSCRIPT, INCLUDED; TWEPRIL, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Chicheportiche et al. (1997) isolated a novel tumor necrosis factor
(TNF; 191160) family member from mouse peritoneal macrophage mRNA. They
also cloned a homologous human cDNA encoding a predicted 249-amino acid
protein they called TWEAK. The TWEAK protein sequence contains the
single transmembrane domain common to TNF family members. Northern blot
analysis revealed that the 1.4-kb mRNA was expressed at varying levels
in many human tissues and cells.

- TWEAK/APRIL Spliced Read-Through Transcript

By RACE, RT-PCR, and screening of a T-cell cDNA library, Pradet-Balade
et al. (2002) isolated a hybrid transcript formed by intergenic splicing
of exons 1 through 6 of TWEAK to exons 2 through 6 of APRIL (TNFSF13;
604472) using the splice donor/acceptor sites of TWEAK and APRIL mRNAs.
The deduced in-frame fusion protein, which the authors called TWEPRIL,
has a calculated molecular mass of 38 kD. TWEPRIL begins at the
initiation codon of TWEAK and contains the intracellular, transmembrane,
and stalk regions of TWEAK fused to the extracellular receptor-binding
domain of APRIL. Northern blot analysis detected a 2.5-kb TWEPRIL
transcript in resting and activated human primary T cells, in monocytic
cell lines, and in colorectal carcinoma cell lines. Transfected human
embryonic kidney cells expressed TWEPRIL as a 48-kD membrane protein.
TWEPRIL appeared to form SDS-stable aggregates that were likely trimers.
Western blot analysis revealed a 48-kD endogenous TWEPRIL protein in
human primary T cells and monocytic cell lines.

Using Northern blot analysis, Pradet-Balade et al. (2002) found that
relative expression of the 1.9-kb APRIL transcript was about 6-fold
higher than that of the 2.5-kb TWEPRIL transcript in resting T cells.
However, in activated T cells, both transcripts were expressed at
similar levels. A similar expression pattern for APRIL and TWEPRIL was
detected in CD4 (186940)-positive and CD8 (see 186910)-positive T-cell
subpopulations. TWEAK expression was similar between resting and
activated T cells. TWEAK was found predominantly in ribosome-free
fractions in both resting and activated T cells, whereas APRIL and
TWEPRIL increased their association with polyribosomes following T-cell
activation, suggesting that translational efficiency of APRIL and
TWEPRIL increases upon T-cell activation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Pradet-Balade et al. (2002) determined that the TNFSF12 gene contains 7
exons.

MAPPING

By analysis of a radiation hybrid panel, Marsters et al. (1998) mapped
the APO3L gene to 17p13. Using the same technique, Chicheportiche et al.
(1997) refined the map position to 17p13.3.

Pradet-Balade et al. (2002) determined that the TNFSF12 gene lies 878 bp
upstream of the putative transcriptional start site of the TNFSF13 gene
on chromosome 17p13.1.

GENE FUNCTION

Chicheportiche et al. (1997) found that expressed TWEAK protein was
secreted from cells, probably following proteolytic cleavage. TWEAK
could induce synthesis of IL8 (146930) from several cell types. Purified
TWEAK induced apoptotic death of HT29 cells cultured with human
interferon-gamma (147570).

Marsters et al. (1998) found that TNFSF12, which they called APO3L,
binds to the death domain-containing receptor DR3 (TNFRSF25; 603366).
They characterized the expression pattern of APO3L, as well as its
ability to induce apoptosis and NF-kappa-B (see 164011) activation in
human cell lines, and found that APO3L has overlapping signaling
functions with TNF, but displays a much wider tissue distribution.
Schneider et al. (1999), however, showed that soluble TWEAK induced
apoptosis of a rhabdomyosarcoma cell line through the
autocrine/paracrine action of induced TNF and proposed that TWEAK used a
receptor distinct from TNFRSF25. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated
binding of TWEAK to a rhabdomyosarcoma cell line, but Western blot and
RNase protection analyses failed to detect the presence of TNFRSF25 on
the cells.

Using flow cytometry and binding analyses, Kaptein et al. (2000) could
not detect binding of TWEAK or any other known TNF ligand to WSL1
(TNFRSF25). They observed that cells devoid of WSL1 or cells from
knockout mice lacking Wsl1 were TWEAK responsive.

Using techniques similar to those of Marsters et al. (1998), Wiley et
al. (2001) could not reproduce their results showing a TWEAK-APO3
interaction. Wiley et al. (2001) identified TWEAKR (TNFRSF12A; 605914),
a small protein with a cysteine-rich motif and a TRAF (see TRAF5;
602356)-binding site, as the TWEAK receptor. TWEAKR shares homology with
some TNFRs and is a fully functional member of the TNFR family. Blocking
of TWEAKR signaling inhibited the migration of renal microvascular cells
in vitro, indicating that endogenous TWEAK regulates endothelial cell
wound closure rates. Wiley et al. (2001) concluded that the TWEAK-TWEAKR
system plays a role in endothelial cell growth and migration.

Tian et al. (2004) demonstrated a direct interaction between TWEAK and
VG5Q (608464), a secreted angiogenic factor that is mutated in some
cases of Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (149000).

Jain et al. (2009) analyzed circulating TWEAK levels in 56 patients with
heart failure and 14 age-matched controls, and found that circulating
TWEAK levels were differentially upregulated in patients with idiopathic
dilated cardiomyopathy (see CMD1A, 115200) compared to patients with
coronary artery disease (see CHDS1, 607339) or hypertension (145500) or
controls. Circulating TWEAK levels did not, however, correlate with
clinical functional parameters in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy.

- TWEAK/APRIL Spliced Read-Through Transcript

Pradet-Balade et al. (2002) found that Jurkat human T cells and Ramos
human B cells cocultured with TWEPRIL-transfected 293T cells showed an
even greater increase in cell growth compared with controls than did
Jurkat human T cells cocultured with APRIL-transfected 293T cells. They
concluded that TWEPRIL is a membrane-bound protein that can induce
proliferation in a manner comparable with APRIL.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using transgenic or adenoviral-mediated gene expression in mice, Jain et
al. (2009) induced elevated circulating levels of TWEAK and observed the
development of dilated cardiomyopathy with subsequent severe cardiac
dysfunction. This phenotype was mediated exclusively by Tweakr,
independent of TNFA, and was associated with cardiomyocyte elongation
and cardiac fibrosis but not cardiomyocyte apoptosis.

615187	TITLE *615187 POST-GPI ATTACHMENT TO PROTEINS 2; PGAP2
;;FGF RECEPTOR-ACTIVATING PROTEIN 1; FRAG1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) modification of plasma membrane
proteins occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and GPI-anchored
proteins are incorporated into rafts in the Golgi during their transport
to the cell surface. PGAP2 appears to be involved in maturation of the
GPI anchor on GPI-anchored proteins (Tashima et al., 2006).

CLONING

By screening an M426 human embryonic fibroblast cell line with rat
Frag1, Lorenzi et al. (1999) cloned PGAP2, which they called FRAG1. The
deduced 316-amino acid protein has 2 N-terminal FRAG1 homology (FH)
domains and 4 possible isoprenylation signals. Hydropathy analysis
suggested that FRAG1 has 7 transmembrane segments. Human and rat FRAG1
share 92% amino acid identity, but the rat protein has only 1 FH domain.
Northern blot analysis detected variable expression of a 2.0-kb FRAG1
transcript in all 16 tissues examined, with highest expression in testis
and pancreas, and lowest expression in brain and thymus. A transcript of
about 3.2 kb was also detected in several tissues, predominantly
pancreas, spleen, and prostate. FRAG1 was also detected in a number of
tumor cell lines at a level comparable to that observed in normal
tissues.

By database analysis and cloning using rat and hamster cDNA libraries,
Tashima et al. (2006) identified human, rat, and hamster cDNAs encoding
a 254-amino acid PGAP2 protein. They also identified a splice variant in
human and hamster that encodes a 250-amino acid isoform lacking a VSQE
sequence. Rat Pgap2 localized to Golgi in transfected NRK cells.

Hansen et al. (2013) stated that the PGAP2 gene encodes 16 different RNA
transcripts, 8 of which encode different isoforms and 8 that are
noncoding RNA. Isoform 8, which is 254 amino acids long and contains 5
alpha-helix domains embedded in the Golgi membrane, is believed to be
the biologically active isoform. The N terminus is in the cytoplasm and
the C terminus is in the Golgi lumen.

GENE FUNCTION

Tashima et al. (2006) found that transfected CHO cells lacking Pgap2
were deficient in cell surface expression of the human GPI-anchored
proteins CD59 (107271) and CD55 (125240). Cotransfection of rat Pgap2 or
the human or hamster variant encoding the short PGAP2 isoform restored
CD59 surface expression. GPI-anchored proteins appeared to traffic
normally through the ER and Golgi, but they were secreted upon arrival
at the plasma membrane via phospholipid D (see 602382)-like activity.
The secreted proteins showed an altered GPI anchor. Tashima et al.
(2006) proposed that remodeling of the GPI anchor occurs in GPI-anchored
proteins, and that in Pgap2-deficient cells, this remodeling is
defective, resulting in GPI-anchored proteins that are sensitive to
cleavage then secretion from the plasma membrane.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lorenzi et al. (1999) determined that the PGAP2 gene contains 6 exons
and spans over 7 kb. The tandem FH domains in the FRAG1 protein are
encoded by exons 1 and 2.

MAPPING

Using FISH and radiation hybrid analysis, Lorenzi et al. (1999) mapped
the PGAP2 gene to chromosome 11p15.5.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of 2 unrelated consanguineous families with
hyperphosphatasia with mental retardation syndrome-3 (HPMRS3; 614207),
Hansen et al. (2013) identified 2 different homozygous missense
mutations in the PGAP2 gene (615187.0001 and 615187.0002, respectively).
In vitro functional expression studies showed that the mutant alleles
were hypomorphic and caused decreased enzyme activity. Hansen et al.
(2013) commented that the disorder due to PGAP2 mutations can be viewed
as part of a disease family representing a spectrum of disorders due to
mutations in genes involved in glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchor
biosynthesis. Mutations in genes earlier in the pathway appear to cause
a more severe phenotype, including dysmorphic features (e.g., MCAHS1,
614080), than mutations in genes that act later in the pathway.

Among 13 individuals with intellectual disability and increased serum
alkaline phosphatase who were screened for mutations in genes encoding
proteins in the GPI-anchor biosynthesis pathway, Krawitz et al. (2013)
found that 2 unrelated patients carried biallelic missense mutations in
the PGAP2 gene (615187.0003-615187.0005). In vitro studies showed that
the mutations caused decreased enzyme activity.

PGAP2, TYR99CYS

In 3 affected members of a consanguineous Syrian family (MR043) with
autosomal recessive hyperphosphatasia with mental retardation-3 (HPMRS3;
614207) originally reported by Abou Jamra et al. (2011), Hansen et al.
(2013) identified a homozygous c.296A-G transition in the PGAP2 gene,
resulting in a tyr99-to-cys (Y99C) substitution between transmembrane
segments 1 and 2 in the Golgi lumen. The mutation, which was found by
exome sequencing of the linked region on chromosome 11p15, was confirmed
by Sanger sequencing and segregated with the disorder in the family. In
vitro functional expression studies in CHO cells showed that the mutant
protein was expressed but had significantly decreased activity compared
to wildtype. Patient lymphoblastoid cells showed essentially normal
expression of the GPI-anchored proteins DAF (125240) and CD59 (107271),
supporting a hypomorphic effect of the Y99C mutation.

PGAP2, ARG177PRO

In affected members of a consanguineous Pakistani family (MR5) with
HPMRS3 (614207) originally reported by Rehman et al. (2011), Hansen et
al. (2013) identified a homozygous c.530G-C transversion in the PGAP2
gene, resulting in an arg177-to-pro (R177P) substitution between
transmembrane segments 3 and 4 in the Golgi lumen. The mutation, which
was found by exome sequencing of the linked region on chromosome 11p15,
was confirmed by Sanger sequencing and segregated with the disorder in
the family. In vitro functional expression studies in CHO cells showed
that the mutant protein was expressed but had significantly decreased
activity compared to wildtype. Patient lymphoblastoid cells showed
essentially normal expression of the GPI-anchored proteins DAF (125240)
and CD59 (107271), supporting a hypomorphic effect of the R177P
mutation.

HYPERPHOSPHATASIA WITH MENTAL RETARDATION SYNDROME 3
PGAP2, LEU127SER

In a Turkish boy, born of consanguineous parents, with HPMRS3 (614207),
Krawitz et al. (2013) identified a homozygous c.380T-C transition in the
PGAP2 gene, resulting in a leu127-to-ser (L127S) substitution at a
highly conserved residue. The mutation segregated with the disorder in
the family. In vitro functional expression studies showed that the
mutant protein had decreased activity compared to wildtype.

.0004
HYPERPHOSPHATASIA WITH MENTAL RETARDATION SYNDROME 3
PGAP2, ARG16TRP

In a 28-year-old Finnish woman with mild HPMRS3 (614207), Krawitz et al.
(2013) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the PGAP2
gene: a c.46C-T transition resulting in an arg16-to-trp (R16W)
substitution, and a c.479C-T transition resulting in a thr160-to-ile
(T160I; 615187.0005) substitution. Both mutations occurred at highly
conserved residues. In vitro functional expression studies showed that
the mutant proteins had decreased activity compared to wildtype. Higher
residual activity of R16W may explain the milder phenotype in this
patient.

VACUOLAR PROTON PUMP, SUBUNIT 1; VPP1
DESCRIPTION ATP-driven proton pumps associated with the clathrin-coated vesicles and
synaptic vesicles are a group of polypeptides involved in basic cellular
processes through acidification of intracellular organelles. These
functions include intracellular targeting of enzymes to lysosomes and
secretory granules, and receptor-ligand dissociation in
receptor-mediated endocytosis. Eight or 9 polypeptides had been
identified from clathrin-coated vesicles. Using a rat cDNA clone for the
116-kD subunit of the vacuolar proton pump, Ozcelik et al. (1991) mapped
the gene to human chromosome 17 by study of rodent-human hybrid cell
lines and the homologous gene to mouse chromosome 11 by a study of
Chinese hamster or rat/mouse hybrid cell lines. In hybrid cell lines
with fragments of chromosome 17, the VPP1 gene was shown to be located
in region 17q21-qter.

In the course of constructing a transcription map of approximately 600
kb of genomic DNA surrounding the BRCA1 (113705) gene, Brody et al.
(1995) identified the VPP1 gene, thus regionalizing it to 17q21.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.3) is the next enzyme after alcohol
dehydrogenase (see 103700) in the major pathway of alcohol metabolism.
There are 2 major ALDH isozymes in the liver: cytosolic ALDH1 (ALDH1A1;
100640) and mitochondrial ALDH2.

CLONING

Hsu et al. (1985) isolated partial cDNA clones of ALDH1 and ALDH2 from a
human liver cDNA library. Hsu et al. (1988) isolated and characterized
ALDH2 genomic clones. The deduced ALDH2 protein contains 517 amino
acids, including a 17-amino acid signal peptide.

GENE FUNCTION

Using an unbiased proteomic search, Chen et al. (2008) identified
mitochondrial ALDH2 as an enzyme whose activation correlated with
reduced ischemic heart damage in rodent models. A high-throughput screen
identified a small molecule activator of ALDH2, which they called
Alda-1, that, when administered to rats before an ischemic event,
reduced infarct size by 60%, most likely through its inhibitory effect
on the formation of cytotoxic aldehydes. In vitro, Alda-1 was a
particularly effective activator of ALDH2*2 (100650.0001), an inactive
mutant form of the enzyme that is found in 40% of East Asian
populations. Chen et al. (2008) concluded that the pharmacologic
enhancement of ALDH2 activity may be useful for patients with wildtype
or mutant ALDH2 who are subjected to cardiac ischemia, such as during
coronary bypass surgery.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hsu et al. (1988) determined that the ALDH2 gene contains at least 13
exons and spans approximately 44 kb.

MAPPING

Hsu et al. (1985) assigned the ALDH2 locus to chromosome 12 by means of
a cDNA probe and Southern blot analysis of somatic cell hybrids. With a
cDNA fragment corresponding to the 3-prime coding part of human ALDH1
mRNA, Braun et al. (1986) studied human-rodent somatic cell hybrids and
confirmed the assignment to chromosome 12. The mitochondrial and
cytosolic forms of ALDH are coded by mouse chromosomes 4 and 19,
respectively (Mather and Holmes, 1984). Comparative mapping in man,
mouse, and bovine led Womack (1990) to suggest that ALDH2 is in the
distal part of 12q, distal to IFNG (147570), a conclusion consistent
with other information on the mapping of these 2 loci.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Data on gene frequencies of allelic variants were tabulated by
Roychoudhury and Nei (1988).

The ALDH2 alleles encoding the active and inactive subunits are termed
'ALDH2*1' and 'ALDH2*2,' respectively; see 100650.0001. It had been
thought that the 2 alleles were expressed codominantly, and that only
individuals homozygous for ALDH2*2 were ALDH2-deficient. However,
studies of the inheritance of alcohol-induced flushing (610251) in
families suggested that the trait is dominant (Schwitters et al., 1982).

- Early Studies of ALDH Isoforms

Harada et al. (1980) presented evidence that ALDH is polymorphic in
Japanese. They identified 2 major isozymes: a faster migrating (low Km
for acetaldehyde) and a slower migrating isozyme (high Km for
acetaldehyde). The unusual slower-migrating phenotype, which had less
enzymatic activity, was found in 52% of the specimens; the
fast-migrating isozyme was absent in these specimens. Harada et al.
(1980) postulated that initial intoxicating symptoms after alcohol
drinking in these individuals may be due to delayed oxidation of
acetaldehyde due to variant or absent ALDH. The slow-migrating ALDH
isoform was strongly inactivated by disulfiram, whereas the
faster-migrating isoform was relatively insensitive to disulfiram. These
isoforms were later identified as ALDH1 and ALDH2, respectively.

Agarwal et al. (1981) performed a population genetic study in East
Asians of several different extractions using hair root lysates to
investigate ALDH isozymes. Between 40 and 80% of the several East Asian
groups were found to be deficient in the faster migrating isozyme,
termed ALDH2, whereas not a single European individual was deficient.
The deficiency was invariably associated with sensitivity to alcohol.
Family studies suggested autosomal recessive inheritance of the
deficiency. Harada et al. (1981) found deficiency of the
fast-metabolizing isoform in 43% of Japanese; all deficient persons had
flushing symptoms and, after alcohol drinking, showed an increased mean
acetaldehyde concentration of 37.3 micromoles as compared with 2.1
micromoles in nondeficient persons. Impraim et al. (1982) investigated
the basis of the lack in about 50% of East Asians of 1 of the 2 major
liver ALDH isozymes. Consistent with a convention of nomenclature
adopted by the worldwide workshops, ALDH1 is cytosolic and ALDH2 is
mitochondrial. Impraim et al. (1982) confirmed that it was the ALDH2
isozyme that was missing in persons of Asian descent. The unusual ALDH2
isozyme in Japanese liver was enzymatically inactive but immunologically
cross-reactive. Thus, a structural mutation at the ALDH2 locus was
presumed to be the genetic basis.

Goedde et al. (1983) noted the existence of 4 isozymes of ALDH, which
differed in electrophoretic mobility and isoelectric point. In a
population study, they found that the frequency of deficiency of the
more active isoform was 69% in Indians of the Ecuador Highlands, 44% in
Japanese, and 35% in Chinese. This deficiency was not seen in Egyptians,
Liberians, Kenyans, or Europeans. The authors suggested that deficiency
is related to flushing and a slower metabolism of acetaldehyde, which
could in turn result in a lower frequency of alcoholism and
alcohol-related problems. (Note that the nomenclature used by some of
these authors is confused: ALDH1 is actually ALDH2).

- Molecular Basis

Hsu et al. (1987) developed a method for distinguishing the 2 main
alleles by means of allele-specific 21-base synthetic oligonucleotides.
Using a pair of synthetic oligonucleotides, one complementary to the
ALDH2*1 allele and the other complementary to the ALDH2*2 allele,

Shibuya and Yoshida (1988) determined the genotypes of 49 unrelated
Japanese persons and 12 Caucasians. The frequency of the atypical allele
was found to be 0.35 in the Japanese samples examined. The atypical
allele was not found in the Caucasians.

Crabb et al. (1989) did genotyping on the liver from 24 Japanese
individuals, using the PCR technique for amplification of genomic DNA.
In correlating genotype with phenotype, they found that both
heterozygotes and homozygotes for ALDH2*2 are deficient in ALDH2
activity; that is, the ALDH2*2 allele is dominant. Since ALDH2 is a
homotetrameric enzyme, random association of active and inactive
subunits, equally expressed, should generate about 6% normal tetramers;
the remainder would contain at least 1 mutant subunit. Thus, if all
tetramers containing at least 1 mutant subunit were inactive, there
would be only 6% activity in heterozygotes. This low amount of activity
is likely to be below the detection limit of activity staining of the
gels.

Using allele-specific oligonucleotides for ALDH2*2, Singh et al. (1989)
studied phenotypically deficient individuals in the Chinese, Japanese,
and South Korean families to determine heterozygous or homozygous
status. All individuals with a heterozygous genotype were found to be
deficient, thus demonstrating that only the normal homotetrameric enzyme
is catalytically active.

Oota et al. (2004) used the ALDH2*2 allele, which is responsible for
catalytic deficiency of ALDH2, and 4 noncoding SNPs to study ALDH2
haplotype frequency and linkage disequilibrium in 37 worldwide
populations. Only 4 major SNP-defined haplotypes were found to account
for almost all chromosomes in all populations. A fifth haplotype
harbored the functional variant and was found only in East Asians.

- ALDH2 and Alcoholism

Crabb (1990) pointed out that the single base mutation in ALDH2
responsible for acute alcohol-flushing reaction in Asians, glu504-to-lys
(ALDH2*2; 100650.0001), is the best-characterized genetic factor
influencing alcohol drinking behavior.

Shibuya et al. (1988) studied 23 Japanese with alcoholic liver disease.
No difference was found in the genotypes at the ADH2 (103720) locus;
however, at the ALDH2 locus, 20 of the 23 patients were homozygous for
ALDH2*1, only 3 were heterozygous, and none of the patients was
homozygous for ALDH2*2. The results were interpreted as indicating that
Japanese with the atypical allele are at a much lower risk for alcoholic
liver disease, presumably due to their sensitivity to alcohol
intoxication.

Thomasson et al. (1991) hypothesized that the polymorphisms of both of
the liver enzymes responsible for the oxidative metabolism of ethanol
may modify the predisposition to development of alcoholism (103780).
Using leukocyte DNA amplified by PCR and allele-specific
oligonucleotides in a study of Chinese men living in Taiwan, they
demonstrated that alcoholics had significantly lower frequencies not
only of ALDH2*2 but also of ADH1B*2 (103720.0001) and ADH1C*1 (see
103730.0002). Goedde et al. (1992) gave extensive population frequency
data on ALDH2 as well as on ADH1B. They again showed that the atypical
ALDH2 gene (ALDH2*2) is extremely rare in Caucasians, Blacks, Papua New
Guineans, Australian Aborigines, and Aurocanians (South Chile), but
widely prevalent among East Asians. They cited evidence indicating that
individuals possessing the ALDH2*2 allele show alcohol-related
sensitivity responses such as facial flushing, are usually not habitual
drinkers, and appear to suffer less from alcoholism and alcohol-related
liver disease.

Muramatsu et al. (1995) used the PCR/RFLP method to determine the
genotypes of the ADH2 and ALDH2 loci of alcoholic and nonalcoholic
Chinese living in Shanghai. They found that the alcoholics had
significantly lower frequencies of the ADH2*2 and ALDH2*2 alleles than
did the nonalcoholics, suggesting the inhibitory effects of these
alleles for the development of alcoholism. In the nonalcoholic subjects,
ADH2*2 had little, if any, effect, despite the significant effect of the
ALDH2*2 allele in decreasing the alcohol consumption of the individual.
Taken together, these results were considered consistent with the
proposed hypothesis for the development of alcoholism, i.e., drinking
behavior is greatly influenced by the individual's genotype of
alcohol-metabolizing enzymes and the risk of becoming alcoholic is
proportionate with the ethanol consumption of the individual.

To investigate possible interactions among the variant alleles ADH2*2,
ADH3*1, and ALDH2*2, Chen et al. (1999) genotyped 340 alcoholic and 545
control Han Chinese living in Taiwan at the ADH2, ADH3, and ALDH2 loci.
After the influence of ALDH2*2 was controlled for, multiple logistic
regression analysis indicated that allelic variation at ADH3 exerts no
significant effect on the risk of alcoholism. Any presumed affect could
be accounted for by linkage disequilibrium between ADH3*1 and ADH2*2;
the 2 genes are located on 4q22. ALDH2*2 homozygosity, regardless of the
ADH2 genotype, was fully protective against alcoholism; no individual
showing such homozygosity was found among the alcoholics. Logistic
regression analyses of the remaining 6 combinatorial genotypes of the
polymorphic ADH2 and ALDH2 loci indicated that individuals carrying 1 or
2 copies of ADH2*2 and a single copy of ALDH2*2 had the lowest risk
(odds ratios = 0.04-0.05) for alcoholism, as compared with the ADH2*1/*1
and ALDH2*1/*1 genotypes. The disease risk associated with the
ADH2*2/*2-ALDH2*1/*1 genotype appeared to be about half of that
associated with the ADH2*1/*2-ALDH2*1/*1 genotype. These results
suggested that protection afforded by the ADH2*2 allele may be
independent of that afforded by ALDH2*2.

Chai et al. (2005) examined ADH2, ADH3, and ALDH2 polymorphisms in 72
alcoholic and 38 nonalcoholic healthy Korean men. Forty-eight of the
alcoholic men had Cloninger type 1 and 24 had Cloninger type 2
alcoholism. The frequency of ADH2*1 (103720.0001) and ADH3*2
(103730.0002) alleles was significantly higher in men with type 2
alcoholism than in men with type 1 alcoholism and in healthy men. The
frequency of the ALDH2*1 allele was significantly higher in men with
alcohol dependence than in healthy men. Chai et al. (2005) suggested
that the genetic characteristics of alcohol metabolism in type 1
alcoholism falls between nonalcoholism and type 2 alcoholism.

Luo et al. (2006) genotyped 16 markers within the ADH gene cluster, 4
markers within the ALDH2 gene, and 38 unlinked ancestry-informative
markers in a case-control sample of 801 individuals. Associations
between markers and disease were analyzed by a Hardy-Weinberg
equilibrium test, a conventional case-control comparison, a structured
association analysis, and a novel diplotype trend regression (DTR)
analysis. All markers were found to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in
controls, but some markers showed Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium in cases
of alcohol dependence. Genotypes of many markers were associated with
alcohol dependence. DTR analysis showed that the ADH5 (103710) genotypes
and diplotypes of ADH1A (103700), ADH1B (103720), ADH7 (600086), and
ALDH2 were associated with alcohol dependence in European Americans
and/or African Americans. The risk-influencing alleles were fine mapped
from among the markers studied and were found to coincide with some well
known functional variants. They demonstrated that DTR was more powerful
than many other conventional association methods. They also found that
several ADH genes and the ALDH2 gene were susceptibility loci for
alcohol dependence, and the associations were best explained by several
independent risk genes.

Although the ALDH2*2 allele is considered to be a genetic deterrent for
alcoholism, Muramatsu et al. (1996) found that 80 of 655 Japanese
alcoholics had the mutant allele. The authors postulated that these
alcoholics had some other factor that overcame the adverse effects of
acetaldehydemia and that such a factor might reside in the brain's
'reward system,' in which dopamine plays a crucial role. Muramatsu et
al. (1996) studied variation at the DRD4 locus (126452) and found a
higher frequency of a 5-repeat allele of the DRD4 receptor 48-bp repeat
polymorphism in alcoholics with ALDH2*2 than in 100 other alcoholics and
144 controls. They found that alcoholics with the 5-repeat allele also
abused other drugs more often.

- ALDH2/HMGIC Fusion Gene

Kazmierczak et al. (1995) found that the ALDH2 gene was a translocation
partner of the HMGIC gene (HMGA2; 600698) in a uterine leiomyoma. Fusion
genes involving HMGIC are found in pleomorphic adenomas of salivary
glands and in a variety of benign mesenchymal tumors.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO-9) containing the
5-prime-TCCC-3-prime motif, which acts by greatly reducing mRNA levels,
Garver et al. (2001) showed that rat hepatoma cells had reduced Aldh2
mRNA levels and activity, resulting in more than 90% inhibition of Aldh2
synthesis, probably mediated by RNase H hydrolysis. Mismatches in the
TCCC motif, in particular, reduced the efficacy of ASO-9, which
specifically reduced mRNA levels of Aldh2 but not of a control
mitochondrial enzyme, glutamate dehydrogenase (GLUD1; 138130). Treatment
of rats with ASO-9 specifically reduced Aldh2 activity by approximately
40% and increased plasma acetaldehyde levels 4-fold after ethanol
administration. Behavioral analysis indicated that ASO-9 treatment
induced an aversion to ethanol. After initial consumption, a reduction
of 61% in ethanol consumption was observed in treated rats, a level
comparable to that achieved with disulfiram (Antabuse). Garver et al.
(2001) concluded that the specificity and lack of side effects of an ASO
that inhibits ALDH2 expression and mimics the Asian phenotype would be
advantageous when compared with disulfiram.

Nitroglycerin, or glyceryl trinitrate (GTN), elicits nitric oxide
(NO)-based signaling to dilate blood vessels. Chen et al. (2005) found
that mitochondrial bioconversion of GTN to NO was absent in mitochondria
obtained from Aldh2-null mice. Vasoactivity from alternative
nitro(so)vasodilators was unaffected. GTN bioactivity could still be
generated in mutant mice and their isolated vascular tissue, but only at
substantially higher concentrations of GTN. Chen et al. (2005) concluded
that ALDH2 is necessary and sufficient for vasoactivity derived from
therapeutic levels of GTN.

Yao et al. (2010) found that a selective ALDH2 inhibitor (CVT-10216),
suppressed cocaine self-administration in rats and prevented cocaine- or
cue-induced reinstatement in a rat model of cocaine relapse-like
behavior. Inhibition of ALDH2 was found to decrease cocaine-stimulated
dopamine production in neurons in the primary ventral tegmental area by
increasing the formation of tetrahydropapaveroline (THP). THP was found
to selectively inhibit phosphorylated (activated) tyrosine hydroxylase
(TH; 191290), and thus reduce dopamine production via negative feedback.
Yao et al. (2010) concluded that reducing cocaine- and
craving-associated increases in dopamine release appears to be the
mechanism by which ALDH2 inhibition suppresses cocaine-seeking behavior.

Langevin et al. (2011) found that the Fanconi anemia DNA repair pathway
counteracts acetaldehyde-induced genotoxicity in mice. Their results
showed that the acetaldehyde-catabolizing enzyme Aldh2 is essential for
the development of Fancd2 (613984)-null embryos. Nevertheless,
acetaldehyde-catabolism-competent mothers (Aldh2 heterozygotes) could
support the development of double-mutant Aldh2-null/Fancd2-null mice.
However, these embryos were unusually sensitive to ethanol exposure in
utero, and ethanol consumption by postnatal double-deficient mice
rapidly precipitated bone marrow failure. Lastly, Aldh2-null/Fancd2-null
mice spontaneously developed acute leukemia. Langevin et al. (2011)
concluded that acetaldehyde-mediated DNA damage may critically
contribute to the genesis of fetal alcohol syndrome in fetuses, as well
to normal development, hematopoietic failure, and cancer predisposition
in Fanconi anemia (see 227650) patients.

Garaycoechea et al. (2012) reported that aged Aldh2-null/Fancd2-null
mutant mice that do not develop leukemia spontaneously develop aplastic
anemia, with the concomitant accumulation of damaged DNA within the
hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) pool. Unexpectedly, they
found that only HSPCs, and not more mature blood precursors, require
Aldh2 for protection against acetaldehyde toxicity. Additionally, the
aldehyde-oxidizing activity of HSPCs, as measured by Aldefluor stain, is
due to Aldh2 and correlates with this protection. Finally, there is more
than a 600-fold reduction in the HSC pool of mice deficient in boh
Fanconi anemia pathway-mediated DNA repair and acetaldehyde
detoxification. Therefore, Garaycoechea et al. (2012) concluded that the
emergence of bone marrow failure in Fanconi anemia is probably due to
aldehyde-mediated genotoxicity restricted to the HSPC pool.

ALDH2, GLU504LYS (dbSNP rs671)

The designation for the ALDH2*2 polymorphism has been changed from
GLU487LYS to GLU504LYS. The numbering change includes the N-terminal
mitochondrial leader peptide of 17 amino acids (Li et al., 2006).

The ALDH2*2-encoded protein was first reported to have a change from
glutamic acid (glutamate) to lysine at residue 487 (Yoshida et al.,
1984). Hempel et al. (1985) and Hsu et al. (1985) also showed that the
catalytic deficiency in mitochondrial ALDH in East Asians that manifests
as acute alcohol sensitivity (610251) can be traced to a structural
point mutation at amino acid position 487 of the polypeptide. The
substitution of lysine for glutamic acid results from a G-A transition.

About 50% of East Asians are missing the ALDH2 isozyme. Impraim et al.
(1982) found that the livers of East Asians lacking the ALDH2 isozyme
show an enzymatically inactive but immunologically cross-reactive
material (CRM) corresponding to the ALDH2 isozyme.

To study the mechanism by which the ALDH2*2 allele exerts its dominant
effect in decreasing ALDH2 activity in liver extracts and producing
cutaneous flushing when the subject drinks alcohol, Xiao et al. (1995)
cloned ALDH2*1 cDNA and generated the ALDH2*2 allele by site-directed
mutagenesis. These cDNAs were transduced using retroviral vectors into
HeLa and CV1 cells, which do not express ALDH2. The normal allele
directed synthesis of immunoreactive ALDH2 protein with the expected
isoelectric point and increased aldehyde dehydrogenase activity. The
ALDH2*2 allele directed synthesis of mRNA and immunoreactive protein,
but the protein lacked enzymatic activity. When ALDH2*1-expressing cells
were transduced with ALDH2*2 vectors, both mRNAs were expressed and
immunoreactive proteins with isoelectric points ranging between those of
the 2 gene products were present, indicating that the subunits formed
heteromers. ALDH2 activity in these cells was reduced below that of the
parental ALDH2*1-expressing cells. Thus, the authors concluded that
ALDH2*2 allele is sufficient to cause ALDH2 deficiency in vitro.

Xiao et al. (1996) referred to the ALDH2 enzyme encoded by the ALDH2*1
allele (the wildtype form) as ALDH2E and the enzyme subunit encoded by
ALDH2*2 as ALDH2K. They found that the ALDH2E enzyme was very stable,
with a half-life of at least 22 hours. ALDH2K, on the other hand, had an
enzyme half-life of only 14 hours. In cells expressing both subunits,
most of the subunits assemble as heterotetramers, and these enzymes had
a half-life of 13 hours. Thus, the effect of ALDH2K on enzyme turnover
is dominant. Their studies indicated that ALDH2*2 exerts its dominant
effect both by interfering with the catalytic activity of the enzyme and
by increasing its turnover.

Because genetic epidemiologic studies have suggested a mechanism by
which homozygosity for the ALDH2*2 allele inhibits the development of
alcoholism (103780) in Asians, Peng et al. (1999) recruited 18 adult Han
Chinese men, matched by age, body-mass index, nutritional state, and
homozygosity at the ALDH2 gene loci from a population of 273 men. Six
individuals were chosen for each of the 3 ALDH2 allotypes, i.e., 2
homozygotes and 1 heterozygote. Following a low dose of ethanol,
homozygous ALDH2*2 individuals were found to be strikingly responsive
with pronounced cardiovascular hemodynamic effects as well as subjective
perception of general discomfort for as long as 2 hours following
ingestion.

Among 71 Japanese nondrinkers and 268 drinkers of alcohol, Liu et al.
(2005) found that drinkers had a significantly higher frequency of the
504glu allele. Individuals with the 504lys allele had an increased risk
of alcohol-induced flushing (odds ratio of 33.0).

In a study of 140 men and women of Chinese, Japanese, and Korean
heritage, Wall et al. (2000) found that those with ALDH2*2 alleles
experienced more severe hangovers (see 610251) and suggested that this
may contribute, in part, to protection against the development of
excessive or problematic drinking in Asian Americans. Yokoyama et al.
(2005) found that inactive heterozygous ALDH2, alcohol flushing, and
increased mean corpuscular volume (MCV) were positively associated with
hangover susceptibility in Japanese workers, suggesting that
acetaldehyde is etiologically linked to the development of hangover.

In 80 Han Chinese patients with arteriography-confirmed coronary artery
disease who used only sublingual nitroglycerin, or glyceryl trinitrate
(GTN) for angina relief, Li et al. (2006) found that the ALDH2*2 allele
was associated with lack of efficacy of sublingual GTN. Enzyme kinetic
analysis revealed that the catalytic efficiency of GTN metabolism of the
glu504 protein is approximately 10-fold higher than that of the lys504
enzyme. Li et al. (2006) concluded that the presence of the ALDH2*2
allele contributes, in large part, to the lack of an efficacious
clinical response to GTN and recommended that this genetic factor be
considered when administering GTN, particularly to Asian patients, 30 to
50% of whom possess the inactive ALDH2*2 mutant allele.

In a study of 32 adult Han Chinese male students with no personal or
family history of alcoholism, Peng et al. (2007) found that
heterozygosity for the ALDH2*2 allele resulted in higher acetaldehyde
levels after alcohol ingestion compared to wildtype homozygotes. After
ingestion, heterozygotes also had faster heart rates, faster blood flow
in the facial and carotid arteries, and more subjective discomfort
compared to wildtype homozygotes. Overall, the findings indicated that
acetaldehyde, rather than ethanol or acetate, are responsible for
observed alcohol sensitivity reactions. Peng et al. (2007) postulated
that ALDH2*2 heterozygotes have decreased aversion to the adverse
effects of alcohol, and thus increased risk of drinking, compared to
those who are homozygous for ALDH2*2.

Among 1,032 Korean individuals, Kim et al. (2008) found that the
combination of the ADH1B his48 allele (dbSNP rs1229984; 103720.0001) and
the ALDH2 lys504 allele offered protection against alcoholism.
Individuals who carried both susceptibility alleles (arg48 and glu504,
respectively) had a significantly increased risk for alcoholism (OR,
91.43; p = 1.4 x 10(-32)). Individuals with 1 protective and 1
susceptibility allele had a lesser increased risk for alcoholism (OR,
11.40; p = 3.5 x 10(-15)) compared to those with both protective
alleles. Kim et al. (2008) calculated that alcoholism in the Korean
population is 86.5% attributable to the detrimental effect of the ADH1B
arg48 and the ALDH2 glu504 alleles.

In a case-control study with 221 Chinese patients with esophageal cancer
and 191 controls, Ding et al. (2010) found that alcohol drinkers with
the ALDH2 A allele showed a significantly increased risk of esophageal
cancer compared to drinkers with the ALDH2 G/G genotype (OR, 3.08) or
compared to nondrinkers with any genotype (OR, 3.05). There was a
significantly higher risk of esophageal cancer in those with higher
alcohol consumption (OR, 11.93), and a dose-dependent positive effect
was observed. Drinkers with high cumulative lifetime consumption
(greater than 2.5 kg*year calculated as grams of alcohol consumed per
day multiplied by number of years of consumption) carrying both the
ALHD2 A allele and the G allele of ADH1B (his48 allele) had an even
higher risk of esophageal cancer (OR, 53.15) compared to individuals
with the ALDH2 G/G and ADH1B A/A genotypes. Ding et al. (2010)
hypothesized that increased acetaldehyde in drinkers with these
susceptibility alleles has a carcinogenic effect.

DESCRIPTION Azen and Maeda (1988) reviewed the proline-rich proteins (PRP) of
saliva, which are encoded by 6 closely linked loci on chromosome 12p.
The proteins fall into acidic and basic groups. The 2 genes that encode
acidic proteins are PRH1 (168730) and PRH2 (168790), and these genes
contain repeated sequences that have a cleavage site for the restriction
enzyme HaeIII. The PRH1 locus codes for the Pa, Db, and PIF proteins.
The PRH2 locus codes for the Pr protein. The 4 genes that encode basic
proline-rich proteins are PRB1, PRB2 (168810), PRB3 (168840), and PRB4
(180990), and these genes contain repeated sequences that have a
cleavage site for the restriction enzyme BstNI. The PRB1 locus encodes
the PmF, PmS, Pe, and Con2 proteins. The PRB2 locus encodes the Ps and
Con1 proteins. The PRB3 locus encodes the G1 protein. The PRB4 locus
encodes the Po protein.

In parotid saliva of a Japanese population, Ikemoto et al. (1977) found
2 phenotypes by electrophoresis in acid-urea starch gels. The protein
showing polymorphism was located in the zone between Pa and the protein
labeled Pb (for protein basic) and thus was termed the parotid middle
band protein (Pm). Inheritance was autosomal dominant. The frequency of
the Pm(+) allele was about 0.38 in Japanese.

Azen and Denniston (1980) showed linkage of Pm and Ps to the Pa-Pr-Db-G1
cluster. On the basis of weak linkage disequilibrium, Ps may be closer
to G1 and Db than to Pa or Pr. Azen and Denniston (1980) provided
evidence for close linkage to 5 other parotid salivary protein loci.

Yu et al. (1980) presented evidence for linkage between Pa and Pr and
between Pr and Db. No significant sex heterogeneity in recombination was
found. Significant sex heterogeneity of recombination between Pa and Db
was found, but the lod score for males did not reach the level usually
accepted as proof of linkage. Population studies suggested linkage
disequilibrium among the three loci. Kauffman et al. (1982) found a
single amino acid difference between PmF and PmS proteins when a portion
of their primary structure was compared. From somatic cell genetic
studies using a human genomic probe, Goodman et al. (1984) concluded
that the cluster of genes encoding proline-rich proteins is located on
chromosome 12 and possibly on 12p since it could be excluded from the
12cen-q24 segment. The human SPC (salivary protein complex) may extend
over a map length of about 15 cM; in comparison, the major
histocompatibility complex has a map length of about 1.8 cM. Against the
proposed genetic length of 15 cM is the conclusion of Maeda (1986) that
the 6 genes of the complex are contained in a 500-kb segment of DNA.
(One cM is approximately 1,000 kb.) (Pm consists of 2 proteins, a fast
and a slow electrophoretic form, called PmF and PmS, respectively.)

Azen and Yu (1984) defined another polymorphism in the proteins of
parotid saliva. Called Pe, it was typed after protein staining in
alkaline polyacrylamide slab gels. The Pe+ allele had a frequency of
about 0.76 in both whites and blacks. From randomly collected samples,
the Pe+ protein was most strongly associated with the Con1 and Ps
proteins, less strongly associated with Pr and Pa proteins, and not
significantly associated with PmF, PmS, PIF, Db, Con2, or G1 proteins.
If it is assumed that the strength of these associations is related in
part to map distance, then these data roughly fit the preferred linear
order of PRP genes as previously determined by family linkage studies:
Ps-Pa-Pr-Pm-G1-Db. Pe was linked to Pa with maximum lod score of 2.69 at
theta = 0.0.

In a full review of salivary proteins, Azen and Maeda (1988) stated that
the 6 genes encoding proline-rich proteins are in a 700-kb interval in
the following order: PRB2--(60 kb)--PRB1--(70 kb)--PRB4--(190
kb)--PRH2--(160 kb)--PRB3--(190 kb)--PRH1.

Kim et al. (1993) presented the nucleotide sequences of 4 members of the
6-member human salivary proline-rich protein family: PRB1 and PRB2,
which encode basic PRPs, and PRB3 and PRB4, which encode glycosylated
PRPs. Each gene is approximately 4 kb long and contains 4 exons, the
third of which is entirely composed of 63-bp tandem repeats and encodes
the proline-rich portion of the protein products. Exon 3 contains
different numbers of tandem repeats in the different PRB genes.
Variation in the numbers of these repeats is also responsible for length
variations in different alleles of the PRB genes.

Comparison of the nucleotide sequences of the 6 PRP genes by Kim et al.
(1993) suggested that they probably evolved from a single ancestral gene
by 4 sequential gene duplications, leading to 6 genes that fall into 3
subsets, each consisting of 2 genes. During this evolutionary process,
multiple rearrangements in gene conversion events occurred mainly in the
region between the 3-prime end of IVS2 and the 3-prime end of exon 3.

610726	TITLE *610726 TRUB PSEUDOURIDINE SYNTHASE, E. COLI, HOMOLOG OF, 1; TRUB1
;;PUS4
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Pseudouridine is an abundant component of rRNAs and tRNAs and is
enzymatically generated by isomerization of uridine by pseudouridine
synthase (Zucchini et al., 2003).

CLONING

Using database analysis and EST clone assembly, Zucchini et al. (2003)
identified TRUB1. The 349-amino acid protein has a predicted molecular
mass of 37.3 kD and contains 1 TruB domain. Northern blot analysis
showed ubiquitous expression of 5.2-, 3.8-, and 1.75-kb transcripts,
with highest expression seen in heart, skeletal muscle, and liver. TRUB1
shares 30% identity and 45% similarity with TRUB2 (610727). Phylogenetic
analysis showed that TRUB1 and TRUB2 group together with the original
eubacterial tRNA synthases, distinct from DKC1 (300126).

GENE STRUCTURE

Zucchini et al. (2003) determined that the TRUB1 gene consists of 8
exons spanning approximately 40 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Zucchini et al. (2003) mapped the TRUB1
gene to chromosome 10.

RHE
RH-NULL DISEASE, AMORPH TYPE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION Rh, elliptocytosis, PGM1, and 6PGD are all on the same chromosome. The
first 2 loci appear to lie between the latter 2 (Renwick, 1971).
Information from cell hybridization studies placed the
Rh-elliptocytosis-PGM(1)-6PGD linkage group on chromosome 1. Jacobs et
al. (1970) reported data suggesting a loose linkage between a
translocation breakpoint near the end of the long arm of chromosome 1
and Rh. Lamm et al. (1970) published family data consistent with loose
linkage of Duffy and PGM1. Renwick (1971) suggested that PGM1 is on the
side of Rh, remote from 6PGD and about 30 centimorgans from Rh. Cook et
al. (1972) confirmed this interval. Although the Rh and Duffy loci are
both on chromosome 1, they are too far apart to demonstrate linkage in
family studies (Sanger et al., 1973). Marsh et al. (1974) found
Rh-negative erythrocytes in an Rh-positive man suffering from
myelofibrosis. Nucleated hemopoietic precursors were circulating in his
blood, and these cells had an abnormal chromosome complement from which
part of the short arm of chromosome 1 had been deleted. They concluded
that the Rh locus probably lies on the distal segment of the short arm
at some point between 1p32 and the end of the short arm. The conclusion
is consistent with the finding of Douglas et al. (1973) that the PGM1
locus, which is linked to Rh, is on the short arm of chromosome 1. Since
the patient of Marsh et al. (1974) did not have deletion of the PGM1
locus in the mutant clone, the Rh locus is probably distal to the PGM1
locus. Corney et al. (1977) observed only 1 recombination in 58
opportunities between the alpha-fucosidase locus (FUCA1; 612280) and the
Rh locus. Rh antigen still eludes chemical definition (Tippett, 1978),
but it is thought to be a lipoprotein. No completely certain example of
recombination within a postulated gene complex has been described.
Steinberg (1965) described a Hutterite family in which the father was
CDe-cde, mother cde-cde, 4 children cde-cde, 3 children CDe-cde, and 1
child (the 6th born) Cde-cde. Steinberg (1965) thought this was an
instance of crossing-over. Mutation and, much less likely, a recessive
suppressor of the D antigen were mentioned as other possibilities. Race
and Sanger (1975) considered a recessive suppressor likely.
(Illegitimacy was excluded by the mores of the sect and by marker
studies.) Rosenfield (1981) wrote: 'We still know nothing about Rh.
Except for Steinberg's one crossover, there have been no exceptions to
the inheritance of Rh antigens in tight haplotype packages. Hopefully,
Rh antigen will be isolated for characterisation but there has been
nothing published since the report of Plapp et al. (1979).' Steinberg et
al. (1984) reexamined the Hutterite family, making use of other markers
thought to be on 1p (6PGD, Colton, UMPK1) and concluded that crossover
or mutation indeed had occurred. (Colton is probably not on chromosome
1p; UMPK1 was not informative in the critical parent (Lewis, 1989).)
They concluded further that if, as seems likely from other evidence, C
lies between D and E, their data indicate that the D gene (116800) is
distal (telomeric) in the Rh complex. This order is consistent with the
rare Rh haplotype D. Race et al. (1950, 1951) considered this haplotype
to represent a probable or possible deletion in a human Rh chromosome.
Race and Sanger (1975) listed 20 homozygotes for this haplotype.
Originating from various populations, they were, in about 80% of the
cases, the products of consanguineous matings. Olafsdottir et al. (1983)
concluded that this Rhesus haplotype is not very rare in Iceland. They
estimated the frequency to be about 1 in 214 persons. They discovered
the haplotype in 2 unrelated women because of difficulty with
crossmatching. Both had formed Rh antibodies, one provoked by
transfusions and the other by 3 pregnancies.

Saboori et al. (1988) purified Rh protein in relatively large amounts
from Rh(D)-positive and -negative blood. Differences in the peptide maps
of the 2 proteins were found. Blanchard et al. (1988) presented indirect
data based on immunologic and biochemical investigations demonstrating
that the Rh D, c, and E polypeptides of the erythrocyte membrane are
homologous but distinct molecular species that can be physically
separated and analyzed. These polypeptides have a molecular weight of
about 32,000. Polypeptides c and E were found by Blanchard et al. (1988)
to be more closely related to each other than to D. All the observations
were consistent with partial divergence among homologous members of a
family of Rh proteins. In a review completed in early 1988, Issitt
(1988) suggested that current molecular genetic methods could finally
end 50 years of speculation as to the genetic determination of the Rh
blood groups. Cherif-Zahar et al. (1990) isolated cDNA clones encoding a
human blood group Rh polypeptide from a human bone marrow cDNA library
using a PCR amplified DNA fragment encoding the known common N-terminal
region of the Rh proteins. Translation of the open reading frame
indicated that the Rh protein is composed of 417 amino acids, including
the initiator methionine, which is removed in the mature protein, that
it lacks a cleavable N-terminal sequence, and that it has no consensus
site for potential N-glycosylation. Hydropathy analysis and predictions
of secondary structure suggested the presence of 13 membrane-spanning
domains, indicating that the Rh polypeptide is highly hydrophobic and
deeply buried within the phospholipid bilayer. In Northern analysis, the
Rh cDNA probe detected a major 1.7-kb and a minor 3.5-kb mRNA species in
erythroid tissues but not in adult liver and kidney tissues or lymphoid
and promyelocytic cell lines. By in situ hybridization using an Rh
protein probe, Cherif-Zahar et al. (1991) mapped the Rh gene to
1p36.1-p34.3.

Whether the 3 sets of Rh antigens--D, Cc, and Ee--that are inherited en
bloc represent separate epitopes on a single protein (as maintained by
Wiener, 1944) or multiple independent proteins encoded by closely linked
genes (as first suggested by Fisher in 1944 (Race, 1944)) has been
controversial since the discovery of the Rh antigens in the early 1940s.
Cherif-Zahar et al. (1990) quoted work of Blanchard et al. (1988)
suggesting that the Rh D, c, and E antigens are carried by 3 distinct
but homologous membrane proteins that share a common N-terminal protein
sequence. It is possible that these are the product of one gene with
multiple splicing alternatives. See also review by Agre and Cartron
(1991). Colin et al. (1991) used Rh cDNA as a probe in Southern analysis
of the Rh locus. They demonstrated that in all Rh D-positive persons 2
strongly related Rh genes are present per haploid genome, whereas 1 of
these 2 genes is missing in Rh D-negative donors. Colin et al. (1991)
concluded that 1 of the 2 genes of the Rh locus encodes the Rh C/c and
Rh E/e polypeptides while the other encodes the Rh D protein. (Both
Fisher and Wiener were partly right.) The absence of any D gene and of
its postulated allelic form d in the Rh D-negative genome explains why
no Rh d antigen has ever been demonstrated.

Using cDNAs amplified from reticulocyte mRNA, Mouro et al. (1993)
investigated CcEe gene differences in Rh-negative individuals homozygous
for dCe, dcE, and dce haplotypes. The RNA analysis was followed by PCR
amplification of specific exons using genomic DNA from donors carrying a
range of common Rh haplotypes. The Ee polypeptide was shown to be
synthesized from the full-length transcript of the CcEe gene and to be
identical in length (417 residues) and very similar in sequence to the D
polypeptide. The Cc polypeptides were synthesized from shorter
transcripts of the same CcEe gene sequence, but spliced so as to exclude
exons 4, 5, and 6 or exons 4, 5 and 8. In both cases, the residue at 226
in exon 5 associated with Ee antigenicity was omitted from the
polypeptide product; see 111700.0001 and 111700.0002. Also see review by
Hopkinson (1993).

The Rh-null phenotype is of 2 types. The most common type, called the
'regulator type,' occurs by an inhibition mechanism; see 268150. This
form is caused by homozygosity for an autosomal recessive suppressor
gene that is genetically independent of the Rh locus, mapping to
chromosome 3 rather than to chromosome 1. The second type of Rh-null,
which was first described in a Japanese family (Ishimori and Hasekura,
1967), is called the 'amorph type' and results from homozygosity for a
silent allele at the Rh locus. In a survey of 42 examples of the Rh-null
phenotype, Nash and Shojania (1987) found that only 5 were of the amorph
type. Perez-Perez et al. (1992) described a Spanish family in which a
silent Rh gene was segregating, giving rise to the amorph type of
Rh-null in the proposita whose parents were first cousins. She suffered
from severe hemolytic anemia. Western blot analysis carried out with
glycosylation-independent antibodies directed against the Rh polypeptide
and the LW glycoprotein, respectively, confirmed that these protein
components were absent from the red cells of the proposita.

Investigations by Cherif-Zahar et al. (1993) failed to reveal any
alteration of the RH genes and transcripts in Rh-null of the silent
type, and they suspected that these variants have a transcriptional or
post-transcriptional alteration of RH genes. Cherif-Zahar et al. (1996)
analyzed the RH locus and sequenced the Rh transcripts from 5
Rh-deficient phenotypes caused by an autosomal suppressor gene (reg and
mod types). They were unable to detect any abnormality; these variants
did not express RH genes but did convey a functional RH locus from one
generation to the next. They also detected no gross alteration in the
CD47 gene structure; transcripts were easily amplified and the
nucleotide sequence was identical to that from controls. This agreed
with binding studies indicating that CD47 is present on the red cell
surface of Rh-deficient cells, although severely reduced (10-15% of
controls). In general, their findings suggested that the low expression
of CD47 on Rh-null erythrocytes results from the defective assembly or
transport to the cell surface when Rh proteins are absent.

Cherif-Zahar et al. (1994) demonstrated that the RHCE gene has 10 exons
distributed over 75 kb. Exons 4 to 8 are alternatively spliced in the
different RNA isoforms. Primary extension analysis indicated that the
transcription initiation site is located 83 bp upstream of the
initiation codon. Study of hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic (HeLa)
cell lines and Northern blot analysis suggested that the expression of
the RH locus is restricted to the erythroid/megakaryocytic lineage.
Consistent with this, putative binding sites for SP1, GATA-1, and Ets
proteins, nuclear factors known to be involved in erythroid and
megakaryocytic gene expression, were identified in the promoter of the
RHCE gene.

Data on gene frequencies of allelic variants were tabulated by
Roychoudhury and Nei (1988).

Mollison (1994) reviewed the genetic basis of the Rh blood group system,
giving a brief survey of the early history. Rosenfield (1989) had
described the bitter disagreements between Wiener and Levine,
particularly over priority of discovery. Mollison (1994) reviewed the
disagreement between A. S. Wiener, who postulated multiple alleles at a
single locus (Wiener, 1943), and R. A. Fisher, who interpreted the data
of R. R. Race (1944) as most compatible with the existence of 3 closely
linked genes. Cartron and Agre (1993) reviewed the protein and gene
structure of the Rh blood group antigens. In summary, Rh-positive
persons have 2 Rh genes, 1 encoding the Cc- and Ee-bearing protein or,
more likely, proteins, and a second encoding the D-bearing protein,
while Rh-negative persons have only 1 Rh gene, the first of the 2
described above.

Cartron et al. (1995) defended the 2-gene model of the Rh blood group
system. They suggested that the RHCE gene encodes the C/c and E/e
proteins through alternative splicing of the primary transcript.
D-positive and D-negative individuals differ on the basis of the
presence or absence of the RHD gene (111680), as a rule; in some
Australian Aborigines and Blacks, a fragment of the RHD gene or a
nonfunctional RHD gene is present. Smythe et al. (1996) found that both
c and E antigens were expressed after transduction of K562 cells with a
single cDNA, indicating that the c antigen does not arise by alternative
splicing (exon skipping) of the product of the RHCE gene.

Valenzuela et al. (1991) reported a strong association between plasma
total iron binding capacity (TIBC) and Cc Rh specificity in a Chilean
primary school population in Santiago. Valenzuela et al. (1995) found
similar results in university students from Medellin, Colombia.

In a 3-generation family ascertained through the East of Scotland Blood
Transfusion Service in Dundee, Scotland, Huang et al. (1996) found that
a cataract-causing mutation was cosegregating with an autosomal dominant
anomaly of Rh type known as the Evans phenotype. The geography and the
genetic linkage suggested that the form of cataract may be the same as
that in the Danish family. The red cell Evans phenotype is produced by a
hybrid RH gene in which exons 2-6 from the RHD gene is transferred to
the RHCE gene. Kemp et al. (1996) also examined 5 unrelated Rh D--
homozygotes and found that, in 4 of them, RHCE sequences had been
replaced by RHD sequences. The 5-prime end of these rearrangements
occurred within a 4.2-kb interval around exon 2. There was, however,
heterogeneity at the 3-prime end of the rearranged genes, indicating
that they were not identical by descent, but rather that independent
recombination events had occurred within a small genomic interval--a
recombination hotspot.

Fisher and Race (1946) proposed a model for the evolution of the RH
polymorphism in which the less common haplotypes (CDE, Cde, cdE, and
CdE) are generated and maintained by recombination from those found at
higher frequency. The frequency ratios of the supposed parental and
recombinant haplotypes suggested that the arrangement D-C-E was most
likely under the crossing-over hypothesis. At the time, they assumed
that the 3 series of antigens were encoded in 3 separate genes; the work
outlined earlier indicated that there are 2. Thus recombination between
the sites encoding C/c and E/e would be intragenic, and occur between
exons that are separated by approximately 30 kb (Cherif-Zahar et al.,
1994). Carritt et al. (1997) presented direct evidence for nonreciprocal
intergenic exchange (gene conversion) occurring once in human history to
generate the common RHCE allele, Ce. They also used new polymorphisms to
construct haplotypes which suggested that intragenic recombination
played a major role in the generation of the less common haplotypes, but
only if RHD lies 3-prime of RHCE, i.e., the order is C-E-D. They
provided both genetic and physical evidence supporting this arrangement.

The high degree of homology between the coding regions of the RHCE and
RHD genes is consistent with an ancestral gene duplication. Carritt et
al. (1997) concluded that the human lineage started with the haplotype
cDe. This is consistent with its very high incidence in black Africans
and their descendants (0.4 to 0.5, compared to less than 0.1 elsewhere).
The common haplotype underlying the RhD- phenotype (cde) almost
certainly represented a loss of RHD from cDe. This haplotype is entirely
absent from some aboriginal groups, e.g., Australian, Eskimo, and
Navajo. How the RhD- haplotype became established in a predominantly
RhD+ population, given the moderate to strong selection against RHD+/-
heterozygotes imposed by fetomaternal incompatibility, was still
unknown. As first pointed out in 1942 by Haldane (1942) and reexamined
by Hogben (1943), Li (1953), and others, selection against heterozygotes
results in unstable population equilibria. In an extended simulation
study, Feldman et al. (1969) concluded that, while reproductive
compensation on the part of RhD- mothers can, in principle, lead to
stable equilibria in the face of such selection, other forces, for
example, heterozygote advantage, must operate to maintain RhD+:RhD-
ratios at their observed levels.

Suto et al. (2000) analyzed the organization of the RH genes by 2-color
fluorescence in situ hybridization on DNA fibers released from
lymphocytes (fiber-FISH) and by using DNA probes of introns 3 and 7 of
the RHCE and RHD genes. Six Rh-positive samples (2 with the D+C-c+E+e-,
2 with the D+C+c-E-e+, and 2 with the D+C+c+E+e+ phenotype) showed the
presence of 2 RH genes within a region of less than 200 kb. Of great
interest was the finding that the genes were arranged in antidromic
order starting from the telomere: tel--RHCE (5-prime to 3-prime)--RHD
(3-prime to 5-prime)--centromere. On the other hand, 2 typical
Rh-negative samples (D-C-c+E+e+) showed the presence of only 1 RHCE
gene, as expected.

Wagner and Flegel (2000) showed that the RH locus represents a gene
cluster: RHD (111680) and RHCE face each other by their 3-prime tail
ends, and a third gene, SMP1 (605348), is interspersed between the 2
rhesus genes. The RHD gene deletion was parsimoniously explained by an
unequal crossing-over event. The inverse orientation of the RH genes may
facilitate gene conversion among both rhesus genes, which would explain
the high frequency of hybrid alleles.

The duplication of the rhesus gene occurred during primate evolution
(Matassi et al., 1999), giving rise to the RHD and RHCE genes in humans.
Thus nonprimate mammals, such as mice, may reveal the ancient state of
the RH locus. With this in mind, Wagner and Flegel (2002) analyzed the
sequence of the region. Based on the gene positions and orientations,
RHCE was determined to represent the ancestral state. The close
proximity of SMP1 and RH known in humans was also observed in the mouse
RH locus. Wagner and Flegel (2002) concluded that RHD arose by
duplication of RHCE. The orientation of RHD was probably inverted during
this event. The so-called rhesus boxes, two 9,000-bp DNA segments of
identical orientation flanking the RHD gene, may have been instrumental
for the duplication.

Avent and Reid (2000) provided a comprehensive review of the Rh blood
group system.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
RH E/e POLYMORPHISM
RHCE, PRO226ALA

Mouro et al. (1993) showed that the difference between the classic
allelic antithetical E and e antigens depends on a point mutation in
exon 5 which changes proline to alanine at residue 226 in the e allele.

.0002
RH C/c POLYMORPHISM
RHCE, CYS16TRP, ILE60LEU, SER68ASN, AND SER103PRO

Mouro et al. (1993) showed that the difference between the classic
allelic antithetical C and c antigens depends on point mutations leading
to 4 amino acid substitutions in exons 1 and 2 in the c allele.

.0003
RH-NULL DISEASE, AMORPH TYPE
RHCE, 2-BP DEL, 966T AND 968A

As noted earlier, RH-null disease (which includes the amorphic and
regulator (268150) types) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by
stomatocytosis and chronic hemolytic anemia. Huang et al. (1998) studied
a German family transmitting a putative amorph Rh-null disease gene.
They analyzed the genomic and transcript structure of Rh30, Rh50
(180297), and CD47 (601028), the 3 loci thought to be most critical for
expression of the Rh complex in the red blood cell membrane. They showed
that in this family the Rh50 and CD47 transcripts were normal in primary
sequence. However, the Rh30 locus contained an unusual double mutation
in exon 7 of the RHCE gene, in addition to a deletion of the RhD gene.
The mutation targeted 2 adjacent codons in multiple arrangements,
probably via the mechanism of microgene conversion. One scheme entailed
a noncontiguous deletion of 2 nucleotides, ATT(ile322) to AT and
CAC(his323) to CC, whereas the other involved a T-to-C transition,
ATT(ile322) to ATC, and a dinucleotide deletion, CAC(his323) to C. They
caused the same shift in open reading frame predicted to encode a short
protein with 398 amino acids. The loss of 2 transmembrane domains and
gain of a new C-terminal sequence probably altered the protein
conformation and impaired the Rh complex assembly. The findings
established the molecular identity of an amorph Rh-null disease gene,
showing that Rh30 and Rh50 are both essential for the functioning of the
Rh structures as a multisubunit complex in the plasma membrane.

607309	TITLE *607309 ADAPTOR-RELATED PROTEIN COMPLEX 1, MU-2 SUBUNIT; AP1M2
;;MU-1B
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

AP1M2 is a member of the medium chain family of the clathrin-associated
adaptor complex AP1. It is expressed exclusively in epithelial cells and
may mediate basolateral sorting of membrane proteins in polarized
epithelial cells.

CLONING

By EST database searching using mouse Ap1m1 (603535) as the query,
followed by screening a placenta cDNA library, Ohno et al. (1999) cloned
a full-length cDNA encoding AP1M2, which they designated mu-1B. The
deduced 423-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 48 kD
and shares 97% sequence identity with the mouse Ap1m2 protein. Northern
blot analysis revealed expression restricted to placenta, lung, kidney,
pancreas, prostate, testis, small intestine, and colon. Dot blot
analysis revealed mRNA in stomach, pituitary gland, salivary gland, and
trachea. Northern blot analysis of cultured cell lines showed expression
restricted to most, but not all, polarized epithelial cells. In situ
hybridization on mouse embryos revealed highest levels of Ap1m2 mRNA
within intestinal mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract, acinar cells of
the pancreas, epithelial cells of hair follicles, and secretory cells
(ameloblasts and odontoblasts) in developing teeth. In vivo
transcription/translation resulted in a protein with an apparent
molecular mass of about 47 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a yeast 2-hybrid assay, Ohno et al. (1999) determined that AP1M2
interacts with a subset of tyrosine-based sorting signals. Folsch et al.
(1999) noted that LLC-PK1 porcine kidney epithelial cells do not express
Ap1m2 and missort basolateral proteins, which are normally targeted
through a tyrosine-based sorting signal, to the apical surface. Stable
expression of AP1M2 selectively restored basolateral targeting, improved
the overall organization of LLC-PK1 monolayers, and had no effect on
apical targeting.

GENE STRUCTURE

Nakatsu et al. (1999) determined that the mouse Ap1m2 gene consists of
11 exons and spans approximately 21 kb.

MAPPING

By FISH, Nakatsu et al. (1999) mapped the AP1M2 gene to chromosome
19p13.2. Using interspecific backcross analysis, they mapped the mouse
Ap1m2 gene to the proximal region of chromosome 9, which shows homology
of synteny to human 19p13.2.

600848	TITLE *600848 NUCLEAR RECEPTOR COREPRESSOR 2; NCOR2
;;SILENCING MEDIATOR FOR RETINOID AND THYROID HORMONE RECEPTORS; SMRT
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

NCOR2 is a transcriptional corepressor that maintains the 'off state' of
nonliganded nuclear receptors. Its interaction with nuclear receptors is
mediated by 2 C-terminal receptor-interacting domains (RIDs). NCOR2
facilitates transcriptional repression by serving as a scaffold protein
to recruit histone deacetylase complexes and chromatin-remodeling
factors (summary by Pei et al., 2011).

CLONING

Transcriptional silencing mediated by nuclear receptors is important in
development, differentiation, and oncogenesis. Chen and Evans (1995)
identified a receptor-interacting factor, NCOR2, which they designated
SMRT, as a silencing mediator (corepressor) for retinoid receptors (see
180240) and thyroid hormone receptors (see 190120). They cloned SMRT
from a HeLa cell cDNA library. The deduced 1,495-amino acid protein has
a calculated molecular mass of 168 kD. It has a proline-rich N-terminal
domain, followed by ERDR and SG regions and a C-terminal domain that
shares significant similarity with mouse Rip13 (NCOR1; 600849). Chen and
Evans (1995) also identified a splice variant of SMRT that encodes a
protein lacking a 46-amino acid sequence in the C-terminal domain.
Northern blot analysis detected ubiquitous SMRT expression.
Immunofluorescence analysis indicated that SMRT is a nuclear protein.
Horlein et al. (1995) proposed that SMRT and NCOR (NCOR1; 600849) belong
to a family of corepressors that they termed TRACs (thyroid hormone- and
retinoic acid receptor-associated corepressors).

Using mouse Smrt and successive 5-prime proximal probes, Ordentlich et
al. (1999) cloned full-length human SMRT from a pituitary cDNA library.
The deduced protein contains 2,517 amino acid. The N terminus contains 2
repression domains separated by a SANT domain and is highly homologous
to the N terminus of NCOR1. Northern blot analysis detected a SMRT
transcript of about 10 kb in all mouse tissues examined, with highest
expression in brain, lung, and spleen. A minor transcript of 8.5 kb was
also detected in most tissues. Ordentlich et al. (1999) also cloned a
splice variant of Smrt from mouse brain that encodes a protein lacking
amino acids 36 through 254 of full-length Ncor2.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Binding of ligand to nuclear hormone receptors induces a conformation
that attracts coactivator proteins containing a leu-x-x-leu-leu motif,
the so-called NR box. Hu and Lazar (1999) showed that NCOR1 and SMRT
contain sequences that are similar to the NR box and are repeated in
each of 2 nuclear hormone receptor interaction domains. Hu and Lazar
(1999) called this box (L/I-x-x-I/V-I) the CoRNR (corepressor/nuclear
receptor; 'corner') box. The corner box is required for nuclear hormone
receptor interaction, and corner box peptides specifically block
corepressor interaction in vitro and repression in vivo. Sequences
flanking the corner box determine nuclear hormone receptor specificity.
Thus, Hu and Lazar (1999) concluded that the key feature of hormone
action, differential recognition of unliganded and liganded nuclear
hormone receptors by coactivators and corepressors, is due to very
subtle differences between CoRNR and NR boxes.

- Crystal Structure

Watson et al. (2012) reported the structure of a complex between an HDAC
(HDAC3; 605166) and a corepressor, NCOR2. The structure revealed 2
remarkable features. First, the SMRT-deacetylase activation domain (DAD)
undergoes a large structural rearrangement on forming the complex.
Second, there is an essential inositol tetraphosphate molecule,
D-myo-inositol-(1,4,5,6)-tetrakisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5,6)P4), acting as
an 'intermolecular glue' between the 2 proteins. Assembly of the complex
is clearly dependent on the Ins(1,4,5,6)P4, which may act as a
regulator, potentially explaining why inositol phosphates and their
kinases have been found to act as transcriptional regulators. This
mechanism for the activation of HDAC3 appears to be conserved in class I
HDACs from yeast to humans, and the authors suggested it opens the way
to novel therapeutic opportunities.

GENE FUNCTION

Chen and Evans (1995) found that association of SMRT with receptors,
both in solution and bound to DNA response elements, was destabilized by
ligand. The interaction with mutant receptors correlated with their
transcriptional silencing activities. The repressor function of thyroid
hormone receptor and retinoic acid receptor appeared to involve direct
interaction with SMRT, possibly in a way that stabilized or promoted
their interaction with the transcription factor TFIIB (189963). Chen and
Evans (1995) showed that ligand caused dissociation of SMRT from the
receptor, triggering the activation process.

Fischle et al. (2002) showed that the catalytic domain of HDAC4 (605314)
interacts with HDAC3 (605166) via the transcriptional corepressor NCOR2.
All experimental conditions leading to the suppression of HDAC4 binding
to NCOR2 and to HDAC3 resulted in loss of enzymatic activity associated
with HDAC4. These observations indicated that class II HDACs regulate
transcription by bridging the enzymatically active NCOR2-HDAC3 complex
and select transcription factors.

Hoberg et al. (2004) presented evidence that IKK-alpha (CHUK; 600664)
phosphorylates chromatin-bound SMRT, stimulating its removal from
chromatin and allowing recruitment of NFKB (see 164011) to promoters and
transcription of NFKB-dependent genes.

Jepsen et al. (2007) reported a critical role for SMRT in forebrain
development and in maintenance of the neural stem cell state. Analysis
of a series of markers in SMRT gene-deleted mice revealed the functional
requirement of SMRT in the actions of both retinoic acid-dependent and
Notch (see 190198)-dependent forebrain development. In isolated cortical
progenitor cells, SMRT was critical for preventing retinoic acid
receptor (see 180220)-dependent induction of differentiation along a
neuronal pathway in the absence of any ligand. Jepsen et al. (2007)
demonstrated that SMRT represses expression of the jumonji
domain-containing gene JMJD3 (611577), a direct retinoic acid receptor
target that functions as a histone H3 trimethyl K27 demethylase and
which is capable of activating specific components of the neurogenic
program.

GENE STRUCTURE

Jiang et al. (2001) determined that the NCOR2 gene contains 45 exons.

MAPPING

By FISH, Ordentlich et al. (1999) mapped the NCOR2 gene to chromosome
12q24.

ANIMAL MODEL

Pei et al. (2011) generated knockin mice expressing point mutations in
both RIDs of Smrt, which disrupted its interaction with nuclear
receptors. On a pure C57BL/6J background, these mice, which Pei et al.
(2011) called Smrt(mRID) mice, died shortly after birth from acute
respiratory distress syndrome due to abnormal terminal differentiation
of type I pneumocytes. Maternal delivery of antithyroid drugs, but not
antagonists of other nuclear receptors, rescued lethality in Smrt(mRID)
pups. Mice treated with antithyroid drugs during the time of terminal
lung differentiation were born alive, showed no evidence of respiratory
distress, and survived to adulthood. Microarray analysis revealed that
Klf2 (602016) expression was downregulated in Smrt(mRID) mice. Chromatin
immunoprecipitation analysis of MLE-12 mouse lung carcinoma cells showed
that both Smrt and thyroid hormone receptor bound a conserved enhancer
region downstream of the mouse Klf2 gene. Overexpression of Klf2 in
MLE-12 cells upregulated expression of type I pneumocyte markers, and
targeted disruption of Klf2 in mouse lung recapitulated the phenotype of
Smrt(mRID) mice. Pei et al. (2011) concluded that regulation of KLF2
expression by SMRT is required for terminal lung development.

609948	TITLE *609948 RING FINGER PROTEIN 216; RNF216
;;TRIAD DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 3; TRIAD3;;
ZINC FINGER PROTEIN INHIBITING NFKB; ZIN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TRIAD proteins, such as TRIAD3, contain 2 RING fingers flanking a
conserved cysteine-rich (C6HC) zinc-binding domain called a double RING
finger-linked (DRIL) domain. Like other RING finger proteins, TRIADs
interact with a variety of proteins (van der Reijden et al., 1999).

CLONING

By yeast 2-hybrid screening of a B-cell cDNA library using RIP (RIPK1;
603453) as bait, followed by database searching and 5-prime RACE, Chen
et al. (2002) cloned TRIAD3, which they called ZIN. The predicted
488-amino acid protein contains 4 central RING-like domains (RLDs) and a
C-terminal proline-rich domain. Northern blot analysis revealed
ubiquitous expression of 3.0- and 6.0-kb transcripts, with highest
levels in peripheral blood leukocytes and testis. Western blot analysis
showed a 56-kD protein in several human cell lines. Immunofluorescence
microscopy suggested a cytoplasmic localization for ZIN, like that of
RIP.

By yeast-2 hybrid screening of a human leukocyte cDNA library using the
cytoplasmic TIR domain of TLR9 (605474) as bait, followed by database
analysis and screening a placenta cDNA library, Chuang and Ulevitch
(2004) cloned 5 splice variants of TRIAD3 that they designated TRIAD3A
to TRIAD3E. TRIAD3A and TRIAD3B encode predicted proteins of 866 and 923
amino acids, respectively. TRIAD3C, TRIAD3D, and TRIAD3E encode
identical proteins of 489 amino acids. All TRIAD3 isoforms contain a
C-terminal TRIAD domain and differ in their N-terminal halves. RT-PCR
analysis showed that TRIAD3A was the most abundant form and was
expressed widely in cell lines and tissues.

GENE STRUCTURE

Chuang and Ulevitch (2004) determined that the TRIAD3 gene contains 17
exons and spans about 160 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Chuang and Ulevitch (2004) mapped the
RNF216 gene to chromosome 7p22.

GENE FUNCTION

Using coimmunoprecipitation experiments and mutation analysis, Chen et
al. (2002) found that interaction of ZIN and RIP required the RLDs of
ZIN. Luciferase and Western blot analysis showed that ZIN inhibited
RIP-, IKKB (IKBKB; 603258)-, TNF (191160)-, and IL1 (see 147720)-induced
NFKB (see 164011) activation in an RLD-dependent manner. ZIN also
potentiated RIP-induced apoptosis. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments
showed that ZIN did not compete with TRAF2 (601895) for interaction with
RIP.

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Chuang and Ulevitch (2004) found that
TRIAD3 interacted with the cytoplasmic domains of TLR3 (603029), TLR4
(603030), TLR5 (603031), and TLR9, but not with that of TLR2 (603028).
Immunoblot analysis showed that expression of TRIAD3A with ubiquitin
(see 191339) resulted in TRIAD3A autoubiquitination and promoted
ubiquitination of TLR9 by acting through UBCH7 (UBE2L3; 603721). TRIAD3A
overexpression caused nearly complete degradation of TLR4 and TLR9
protein, but not TLR2 protein, while its effects on TLR3 and TLR5 were
smaller. The TRIAD3A-induced reduction in TLR protein expression was
paralleled by reductions in signal-specific activation for TLRs, as
shown by RT-PCR and small interfering RNA analyses. Chuang and Ulevitch
(2004) concluded that TRIAD3A is an intracellular protein that regulates
TLR expression and limits the potentially harmful effects that occur
after TLR activation.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a 7-generation consanguineous Palestinian family with cerebellar
ataxia and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (CAHH; 212840), Margolin et al.
(2013) performed exome sequencing and identified homozygosity for 2
missense mutations in 2 different genes, RNF216 (R751C; 609948.0001) and
OTUD4 (G333V; 611744.0001), that segregated with disease in the family.
Sequencing both genes in 9 more patients revealed no further mutations
in the OTUD4 gene, although 1 proband was compound heterozygous for
mutations in RNF216 (609948.0002 and 609948.0003). In addition, several
patients carried heterozygous mutations in RNF216 that were also
detected in unaffected parents and sibs. Margolin et al. (2013)
suggested that the most parsimonious explanation for the observed
patterns in these patients would be oligogenic inheritance.

ANIMAL MODEL

Margolin et al. (2013) injected splice-blocking morpholino
oligonucleotides against the zebrafish genes rnf216 or odud4 (611744)
and observed defects in the eye, optic tetum, and cerebellum.
Combinatorial suppression of both genes exacerbated these phenotypes,
which were rescued by wildtype but not mutant human RNF216 or OTUD4
messenger RNA.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CEREBELLAR ATAXIA AND HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM
RNF216, ARG751CYS

In 3 affected sibs from a 7-generation consanguineous Palestinian family
with cerebellar ataxia and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (CAHH; 212840),
originally reported by Seminara et al. (2002), Margolin et al. (2013)
identified homozygosity for 2 missense mutations in 2 genes: a c.2251C-T
transition in the RNF216 gene, resulting in an arg751-to-cys (R751C)
substitution at a highly conserved residue in the second RING domain,
and a missense mutation in the OTUD4 gene (G333V; 611744.0001). The
mutations segregated with disease in the family and neither was found in
672 Middle Eastern control chromosomes, including 36 Palestinian
chromosomes; furthermore, the RNF216 R751C mutation was not found in
13,006 chromosomes from the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, although the
OTUD4 G333V variant was detected in 2 of those chromosomes. The
phenotype of mutant zebrafish injected with splice-blocking morpholino
oligonucleotides against rnf216 could be rescued by wildtype but not
mutant RNF216 mRNA, suggesting that the R751C mutation affects protein
function. The 3 sibs had prominent cerebellar and mild cortical atrophy
with hypodensities in the cerebral white matter on CT scan, and all died
in the fifth decade of life after the development of dementia, 2 from
aspiration pneumonia and 1 from possible pulmonary embolism.
Neuropathologic examination of the brain of 1 sib revealed neuronal loss
in cerebellar pathways and the hippocampus; surviving hippocampal
neurons contained ubiquitin-immunoreactive intranuclear inclusions.

CEREBELLAR ATAXIA AND HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM
RNF216, CYS597TER

In a Caucasian man with cerebellar ataxia and hypogonadotropic
hypogonadism (212840), who developed dementia at 22 years of age and
died at age 36, Margolin et al. (2013) identified compound
heterozygosity for a c.1791T-A transversion in the RNF216 gene,
resulting in a cys597-to-ter (C597X) substitution in the first RING
finger domain, and a 2-bp deletion (c.615_616delGA; 609948.0003),
causing a frameshift predicted to result in a premature termination
codon (glu505aspfsX15). The patient's unaffected parents were each
heterozygous for 1 of the mutations, neither of which was found in
13,006 chromosomes from the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project.

610711	TITLE *610711 TESTIS-SPECIFIC SERINE/THREONINE KINASE 4; TSSK4
;;TSSK5
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TSSK4 belongs to a family of serine/threonine kinases highly expressed
in testis (Chen et al., 2005).

CLONING

By searching databases for TSSK-like sequences, followed by PCR of a
testis cDNA library, Chen et al. (2005) cloned TSSK4, which they called
TSSK5. The deduced 328-amino acid protein is a putative serine/threonine
kinase. Northern blot analysis failed to detect TSSK4 expression, but
RT-PCR revealed TSSK4 expression in testis only.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis and in vitro pull-down experiments, Chen et
al. (2005) showed the TSSK4 interacted with CREB (123810). TSSK4
phosphorylated CREB at ser133 and activated a CRE/CREB reporter gene in
transfected HEK293T cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Chen et al. (2005) determined that the TSSK4 gene contains 4 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Chen et al. (2005) mapped the TSSK4 gene
to chromosome 14q11.2.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Overexpression of ERBB2 (164870) correlates with a poor prognosis in
breast cancer. Instead of functioning as a heterodimeric receptor,
overexpressed ERBB2 appears to act as a constitutively signaling,
autophosphorylating homodimer. To isolate genes whose expression is
reversibly regulated by ERBB2 signaling as a homodimer, Lu et al. (1999)
treated a mammary epithelial cell line overexpressing ERBB2 with an
antibody (4D5) that downregulates its phosphorylation. Using isolated
partial cDNAs to screen fetal brain and breast cancer cell line cDNA
libraries, they isolated a full-length cDNA, which they designated PLU1.
PLU1 encodes a deduced 1,544-amino acid protein containing 3
cysteine-rich zinc-binding PHD/LAP domains, a DNA-binding domain that is
also found in the Drosophila dead ringer (dri) gene, 5 putative nuclear
localization signals, and other conserved regions of unknown function.
Northern blot analysis revealed expression of PLU1 transcripts at low
levels in nonmalignant mammary cell lines and in colon cancer cell lines
but at high levels in breast cancer cell lines. High expression in
transformed breast cell lines decreased after treatment with 4D5. In
situ hybridization analysis detected strong expression in the invasive
but not in the benign components of primary breast carcinomas. Northern
blot analysis detected high mRNA levels in normal testis and low levels
in placenta, ovary, and tonsil. In situ hybridization analysis
demonstrated expression in Sertoli cells. Western blot,
immunohistochemical, and confocal microscopy analyses determined that
PLU1 is expressed as a 170-kD protein in the nucleus. Permanent PLU1
transfectants could not be obtained, suggesting that overexpression of
PLU1 may not be compatible with cell viability.

Kashuba et al. (2000) used a NotI-linking clone as a probe to isolate a
novel putative member of the retinoblastoma-binding protein family,
which they termed retinoblastoma-binding protein-2 homolog-1A
(RBBP2H1A). They found that the maximum open reading frame encodes a
deduced 1,681-amino acid protein containing 3 DNA-binding zinc finger
domains and 2 bipartite nuclear localization signals. Except for an
additional 137 amino acids, the protein is identical to PLU1. The
RBBP2H1A protein shares 56% overall amino acid sequence identity with
RBBP2 (180202), which plays an important role in RB (614041) tumor
suppressor regulation. Northern blot analysis showed expression of
approximately 6- and 7-kb transcripts in all tissues tested, with widely
varying levels of expression among tissues. The highest level of
expression was detected in testis and the lowest in skeletal muscle. No
expression was detected in renal cell carcinoma biopsies or cell lines.

By bioinformatic analysis, Xiang et al. (2007) identified full-length
JARID1B as a histone lysine demethylase. It has an N-terminal JmjN
domain, followed by an ARID domain, a PHD domain, a JmjC domain, a zinc
finger, and 2 C-terminal PHD domains.

GENE FUNCTION

Through bioinformatic and biochemical analysis, Xiang et al. (2007)
identified JARID1B as an H3 (see 602810) lys4 (H3K4) demethylase.
Overexpression of JARID1B in HeLa cells resulted in loss of tri-, di-,
and monomethyl H3K4, but did not alter the methylation status of H3K9 or
H3K36. In vitro biochemical experiments confirmed that JARID1B directly
catalyzed the demethylation. Enzymatic activity required the JmjC domain
of JARID1B and used Fe(II) and alpha-ketoglutarate as cofactors.
Expression of JARID1B was upregulated in prostate cancer tissue compared
with benign prostate hyperplasia. JARID1B associated with androgen
receptor (AR; 313700) and regulated its transcriptional activity in
reporter gene assays.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Lu et al. (1999) and Kashuba et
al. (2000) mapped the RBBP2H1A gene to chromosome 1q32 in the same
region as RBBP5 (600697).

607606	TITLE *607606 KERATIN 9; KRT9
;;K9
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Langbein et al. (1993) reported the cloning and sequence of the KRT9
gene. The amino acid sequence showed the typical structure of type I
cytokeratins, with a head (153 residues), alpha-helical
coiled-coil-forming rod (306 residues), and tail (163 residues) domains.
(In an erratum, the authors stated that the polypeptide has 623
residues, 154 in the head domain, with a calculated molecular mass of 63
kD.) The keratin 9 protein displayed highest homology to human keratin
10 (148080), not only in the highly conserved rod domain but also in
large parts of the head and tail domains. Expression was confined to
palmar and plantar epidermis. In situ hybridization and
immunolocalization showed expression in subrabasal cell layers.

MAPPING

Hennies et al. (1994) mapped the KRT9 gene to chromosome 17 by PCR
amplification from a chromosome 17-only hybrid. Reis et al. (1994)
refined the assignment of the KRT9 gene to 17q21.1-q21.2 by fluorescence
in situ hybridization.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 5 unrelated German pedigrees with epidermolytic palmoplantar
keratoderma (EPPK; 144200), including the family originally described by
Thost (1880) and the family previously studied by Reis et al. (1992)
that showed linkage to chromosome 17q11-q23, Reis et al. (1994)
identified heterozygosity for a missense mutation in the KRT9 gene
(R162W; 607606.0001). Two other missense mutations were also detected in
1 EPPK kindred each, N160K (607606.0004) and R162Q (607606.0005),
respectively. All 3 mutations involved highly conserved residues in coil
1A of KRT9, thought to be important for dimer formation in intermediate
filaments. Reis et al. (1994) noted that the R162W and R162Q mutations
are in the residue corresponding to the arginine that is altered in
KRT14 (R125, see 148066.0002 and 148066.0003) and KRT10 (R156, see
148080.0003 and 148080.0010) in epidermolysis bullosa simplex and
epidermolytic hyperkeratosis, respectively.

In a large 4-generation German EPPK kindred, Hennies et al. (1993, 1994)
identified a missense mutation in the KRT9 gene (Q171P; 607606.0002).

In affected members of a large 4-generation French kindred with EPPK
originally reported by Blanchet-Bardon et al. (1987), in which 8 of 10
affected females over 40 years of age also developed breast or ovarian
cancer, Torchard et al. (1994) identified a missense mutation in the
KRT9 gene (N160Y; 607606.0003). Noting that the KRT9 gene is not
expressed in the mammary gland, Torchard et al. (1994) stated that the
most likely explanation for the association of EPPK with hereditary
breast/ovarian cancer syndrome is that the 2 conditions resulted from
distinct genetic events on chromosome 17q in linked genes.

Kobayashi et al. (1996) obtained experimental evidence that the
arg162-to-gln point mutation (607606.0005) observed in patients with
epidermolytic hereditary palmoplantar keratoderma (Reis et al., 1994)
has a dominant-negative effect on keratin network formation. Transient
transfection of KRT9 cDNA into both epithelial- and epidermal-derived
cell lines showed normal keratin network formation in cells transfected
with normal KRT9 cDNA and disrupted keratin filaments with droplet
formation in cells transfected with the mutant KRT9 cDNA. Kobayashi et
al. (1996) also summarized published reports of mutations in KRT9
associated with EPPK (their Figure 3) and commented that amino acid
residues 156-171, which correspond to the head of the keratin 9
alpha-helical domain, may be crucial for keratin filament assembly and
intermediate filament network formation. (Allelic variants 607606.0001
through 607606.0008 are within the same region of the KRT9 polypeptide
cited by the authors. PMC.)

Covello et al. (1998) studied 4 Northern Irish kindreds with
epidermolytic palmoplantar keratoderma. Heterozygous missense mutations
in exon 1 of KRT9 were detected in all of the families: met156 to thr
(607606.0010) in 1 family; met156 to val (607606.0006) in 2 kindreds;
and arg162 to gln (607606.0005) in 1 family. Covello et al. (1998) noted
that all reported EPPK mutations had occurred in the helix initiation
motif at the start of the central coiled-coil rod domain of K9.

Kuster et al. (2002) analyzed the KRT9 gene in members of the EPPK
pedigree originally described by Vorner (1901) and identified
heterozygosity for a missense mutation in affected individuals
(607606.0013).

In a family from Shandong Province, China, with autosomal dominant
epidermolytic palmoplantar keratoderma associated with knuckle pads (see
144200), Lu et al. (2003) identified a heterozygous missense mutation in
the KRT9 gene (L160F; 607606.0012).

In a 5-generation Taiwanese family with EPPK in which 6 of 13 affected
individuals had knuckle pads, Chiu et al. (2007) identified
heterozygosity for the R163W mutation in the KRT9 gene. The authors
stated that because of renumbering of the KRT9 gene, this mutation was
identical to that previously designated R162W.

In a 4-generation southern Italian family in which 11 of 24 members had
EPPK, 1 of whom also had knuckle pads, Codispoti et al. (2009)
identified the common R163W mutation in the KRT9 gene. Expression of
KRT9 from a knuckle-pad biopsy was found to be increased almost 90-fold
compared to control.

KRT9, ARG163TRP

The numbering of this KRT9 mutation (R163W) is based on the numbering
system used by Lu et al. (2003). Early reports designated this mutation
ARG162TRP.

In 5 unrelated German pedigrees with epidermolytic palmoplantar
keratoderma (EPPK; 144200), including the family originally described by
Thost (1880) and the family previously studied by Reis et al. (1992)
with linkage to chromosome 17q11-q23, Hennies et al. (1993) and Reis et
al. (1994) identified heterozygosity for a C-T transition in exon 1 of
the KRT9 gene, resulting in an arg162-to-trp substitution at a highly
conserved residue in coil 1A of KRT9. The mutation cosegregated
completely with disease in a large 6-generation EPPK family and was not
found in 42 unrelated controls. Haplotype analysis showed that in 3
large EPPK families, the mutation cosegregated with the same haplotype,
whereas the 2 other families carried different mutant haplotypes at the
KRT9 locus, suggesting that the mutation occurred independently on
different haplotypes, or, more probably, that the mutation is not of
recent origin.

Bonifas et al. (1994) found the same R162W mutation in a family with
EPPK previously reported by Berth-Jones and Hutchinson (1989). These
were, however, independent mutations because the R162W mutation reported
by Reis et al. (1994) occurred on an allele with 23 CA repeats in the
microsatellite in intron 4 of the KRT9 gene, whereas the mutant allele
reported by Bonifas et al. (1994) contained 24 CA repeats.

In 13 affected members of a 5-generation Taiwanese family with EPPK, 6
of whom also had knuckle pads (see 144200), Chiu et al. (2007)
identified heterozygosity for the R163W mutation.

In a 4-generation southern Italian family in which 11 of 24 members had
EPPK, 1 of whom also had knuckle pads, Codispoti et al. (2009)
identified heterozygosity for the R163W mutation. Quantitative RT-PCR
analysis of a knuckle-pad skin biopsy revealed an almost 90-fold
increase in KRT9 expression compared to control.

In 4 affected members of a large 4-generation French kindred with
epidermolytic palmoplantar keratoderma (144200), originally reported by
Blanchet-Bardon et al. (1987) and in which 8 of 10 affected females over
40 years of age also developed breast or ovarian cancer, Torchard et al.
(1994) identified an A-T transversion resulting in an asn160-to-tyr
(N160Y) substitution at a conserved residue at the beginning of the rod
domain in the KRT9 gene. The mutation was not found in unaffected family
members or in 20 unrelated controls. Noting that the KRT9 gene is not
expressed in the mammary gland, Torchard et al. (1994) stated that the
most likely explanation for the association of EPPK with hereditary
breast/ovarian cancer syndrome is that the 2 conditions resulted from
distinct genetic events on chromosome 17q in linked genes.

In a family with epidermolytic palmoplantar keratoderma (144200), Reis
et al. (1994) identified a T-A transversion in exon 1 of the KRT9 gene,
resulting in an asn160-to-lys (N160K) substitution at a highly conserved
residue in coil 1A of KRT9. The mutation was not found in 64 unrelated
controls.

system used by Lu et al. (2003). Early reports designated this mutation
ARG162GLN.

In a family with epidermolytic palmoplantar keratoderma (144200), Reis
et al. (1994) identified a G-A transition in exon 1 of the KRT9 gene,
resulting in an arg161-to-gln (R161Q) substitution at a highly conserved
residue in coil 1A of KRT9. The mutation was not found in 64 unrelated
controls.

Kobayashi et al. (1996) obtained experimental evidence that the
arg162-to-gln point mutation observed in patients with EPPK has a

MET156VAL.

In 2 unrelated German patients with EPPK (144200), Hennies et al. (1994)
found an A-to-G transition at nucleotide 532 leading to a substitution
of methionine by valine at codon 156 of the KRT9 gene.

In 2 Northern Irish EPPK kindreds, Covello et al. (1998) identified

In a family with EPPK (144200) reported by Fritsch et al. (1978),
Bonifas et al. (1994) identified a substitution of serine for
asparagine-160. Two other mutations of the same codon had been
described: asn160-to-tyr (607606.0003) and asn160-to-lys (607606.0004).

The numbering of this KRT9 mutation (L168S) is based on the numbering
system used by Lu et al. (2003). Early reports designated this mutation
LEU167SER. The mutation has also been referred to as L15S.

Rothnagel et al. (1995) searched for mutations in the KRT9 gene in 6
unrelated patients with epidermolytic palmoplantar keratoderma (144200).
In 2 of these, they found mutations that altered critical residues
within the highly conserved helix initiation motif at the beginning of
the rod domain of keratin 9. In a 3-generation Middle Eastern kindred,
they found a C-to-T transition at codon 162 that resulted in an arginine
to tryptophan substitution at position 10 of the 1A alpha-helical
domain, thus confirming this codon as a hotspot for mutation in keratin
9 (see 607606.0001). The other mutation they found involved a T-to-C
transition at codon 167 that resulted in the expression of a serine
residue in place of the normal leucine at position 15 of the 1A segment.

KRT9, LEU160VAL

The numbering of this KRT9 mutation (L160V) is based on the numbering

In a Japanese kindred with epidermolytic palmoplantar keratoderma
(144200), Endo et al. (1997) identified a C-to-G transversion in
nucleotide 541 of the keratin 9 gene that converted a leucine residue
(CTC) to a valine (GTC) at codon 159. As in all other reported cases of
keratin 9 mutations in EPPK, this mutation was found within the highly
conserved coil 1A of the rod domain, which is considered to play a role
in the correct alignment of the coiled-coil molecules. In this family,
diffuse yellowish hyperkeratosis was limited strictly to the palms and
soles. The first patient presented with symptoms during the first 6
months of life.

(144200), Rugg et al. (2002) detected by denaturing high performance
liquid chromatography a G-to-A transition at nucleotide 508 of the KRT9
gene that resulted in a val170-to-met (V170M) amino acid substitution.

.0012
PALMOPLANTAR KERATODERMA, EPIDERMOLYTIC, WITH KNUCKLE PADS
KRT9, LEU160PHE

In a family from Shandong Province, China, with autosomal dominant
epidermolytic palmoplantar keratoderma associated with knuckle pads (see
144200), Lu et al. (2003) identified a heterozygous 544C-T transition in
exon 1 of the KRT9 gene, resulting in a leu160-to-phe (L160F) mutation.
Both the hyperkeratosis and knuckle pads were friction-related. Lu et
al. (2003) stated that aggravation of the hyperkeratosis by friction had
not previously been reported. The right hand of each right-handed
affected member showed more severe hyperkeratosis than the less
frequently used left hand. The knuckle pads on the right hand were
likewise more prominent than those on the left hand. Furthermore, the
knuckle pad on the more frequently used proximal interphalangeal joint
of the index finger was more severely affected than that on the less
frequently used interphalangeal joint of the thumb. One patient showed
EPPK symptoms approximately 5 months after birth, whereas another showed
EPPK symptoms at a little more than 1 year after birth.

in the KRT9 gene, resulting in an asn160-to-ile (N160I) substitution at
a highly conserved residue in the coil-1 A segment at the beginning of
the central rod domain. The mutation was not found in 2 unaffected
family members or in 100 control chromosomes.

;;PLASMA MEMBRANE Ca(2+)-ATPase, TYPE 4; PMCA4;;
ATP2B2, FORMERLY
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The Ca(2+)-ATPases are a family of plasma membrane pumps encoded by at
least 4 genes: ATP2B1 (108731) on chromosome 12q21; ATP2B2 (108733) on
3q26; ATP2B3 (300014) on Xq28; and ATP2B4.

CLONING

By PCR, Brandt et al. (1992) detected expression of the PMCA4a variant
in all tissues examined. They identified a second variant, PMCA4b, that
was primarily expressed in skeletal muscle, small intestine, heart,
spinal cord, and brain. Brandt et al. (1992) isolated the full-length
PMCA4b cDNA from a fetal brain cDNA library. The deduced 473-amino acid
protein lacks a large portion of the C terminus found in PMCA4a.

By RT-PCR, Santiago-Garcia et al. (1996) found variable expression of
the PMCA and SERCA (see 108730) genes during human fetal heart
development. PMCA4 and PMCA1 were expressed in 8-, 12-, and 20-week
fetal heart and in adult heart. Two PMCA4 splice variants were detected
in heart tissue, whereas only 1 was detected in placenta.

Okunade et al. (2004) examined Pmca1 and Pmca4 expression in mouse
tissues. Pmca1 was expressed in all tissues examined, and Pmca4 was
expressed in all tissues examined except liver. Pmca1 predominated in
brain, intestine, kidney, lung, and stomach, whereas Pmca4 predominated
in aorta, portal vein, bladder, diaphragm, seminal vesicles, and testis.
Immunostaining localized Pmca4 to the principal piece of the sperm tail,
the location of Catsper (606389), the major Ca(2+) channel required for
sperm motility.

MAPPING

Olson et al. (1991) mapped the PMCA4 gene to chromosome 1q25-q32 by
Southern analysis of human-rodent somatic cell hybrids, in situ
hybridization of human metaphase spreads, and genetic linkage analysis
in the CEPH pedigrees. No evidence was obtained for multiple copies of
the gene at this locus; however, a cross-hybridizing sequence was
detected on Xq13-qter at low stringency.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Associations Pending Confirmation

For discussion of a possible association between variation in the ATP2B4
gene and resistance to severe malaria, see 611162.

ANIMAL MODEL

Chen et al. (2004) expressed mouse Cd22 (107266) in mouse and chicken
B-cell lines devoid of Cd22 and examined B cells from mice deficient in
Cd22 or Pmca4. They identified an activation-dependent interaction
between phosphorylated Cd22 and Pmca4 and found that Cd22 together with
Shp1 (PTPN6; 176883) provided negative control of B-cell activation by
enhancing Pmca4-mediated calcium efflux after B-cell receptor
stimulation.

Okunade et al. (2004) found that loss of both copies of the mouse Pmca4
gene resulted in no overt phenotype. Loss of Pmca4 impaired phasic
contractions and caused apoptosis in portal vein smooth muscle in vitro,
but this phenotype was dependent on the mouse strain employed. On a
Black Swiss background, the phenotype was not expressed unless the mice
also carried a null mutation in 1 copy of the Pmca1 gene. Pmca4 -/- male
mice were infertile but had normal spermatogenesis and mating behavior.
Pmca4 -/- sperm that had not undergone capacitation exhibited normal
motility but did not achieve hyperactivated motility needed to traverse
the female genital tract. Ultrastructure of the motility apparatus of
mutant sperm tails showed mitochondrial condensation, indicating Ca(2+)
overload. Okunade et al. (2004) concluded that PMCA4 expression in the
principal piece of sperm tail is essential for hyperactivated motility
and male fertility.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

X-prolyl aminopeptidase (EC 3.4.11.9) is a proline-specific
metalloaminopeptidase that specifically catalyzes the removal of any
unsubstituted N-terminal amino acid that is adjacent to a penultimate
proline residue. Because of its specificity toward proline, it has been
suggested that X-prolyl aminopeptidase is important in the maturation
and degradation of peptide hormones, neuropeptides, and tachykinins, as
well as in the digestion of otherwise resistant dietary protein
fragments, thereby complementing the pancreatic peptidases. Deficiency
of X-prolyl aminopeptidase results in excretion of large amounts of
imino-oligopeptides in urine (Blau et al., 1988).

CLONING

X-prolyl aminopeptidase has been isolated from different tissues and
species. Vergas Romero et al. (1995) reported the complete amino acid
sequence of the pig kidney enzyme. The nucleotide sequences of the
X-prolyl aminopeptidase-encoding genes (pepP) from several
microorganisms have been reported. By RT-PCR of
phytohemagglutinin-stimulated lymphocyte mRNA, Vanhoof et al. (1997)
isolated a novel human cDNA, named XPNPEPL, that encodes a 623-amino
acid protein exhibiting 44% sequence identity and 62% sequence
similarity to pig kidney X-prolyl aminopeptidase and high sequence
homology to proteins in S. pombe and S. cerevisiae. Northern blot
analysis indicated ubiquitous expression of XPNPEPL as a 2.7-kb
transcript, with the highest expression in pancreas, followed by heart
and muscle.

Sprinkle et al. (2000) cloned XPNPEPL, which they termed soluble
aminopeptidase P (SAMP), or XPNPEP1. They noted the presence of 4 blocks
of sequences homologous to E. coli methionine aminopeptidase, which is
part of the 'pita-bread fold' family. Like the bacteria enzyme, XPNPEPL
contains a putative proton shuttle (residue 395) and 5 divalent metal
ligands (residues 415, 426, 485, 523, and 537). Sprinkle et al. (2000)
proposed that the enzyme inactivates bradykinin and is part of an
intracellular kallikrein-kinin system, possibly in secretory vesicles.

Cottrell et al. (2000) cloned and characterized XPNPEPL, which they
designated cytosolic APP. They identified an arg residue at position 332
instead of the pro residue reported by Vanhoof et al. (1997) and
determined that the cytosolic protein is 43% identical to membrane
aminopeptidase P (XPNPEP2; 300145). The cytosolic enzyme lacks the
hydrophobic signal sequences for an N-terminal signal peptide and a
C-terminal GPI anchor found in the membrane-bound enzyme. Immunoblot
analysis showed expression of a 71-kD homodimer protein capable of
hydrolyzing bradykinin in a divalent cation-dependent manner, similar to
XPNPEP2. The principal metal in the purified recombinant protein was
manganese, at an approximately 1:1 molar ratio.

Using RT-PCR, Ersahin et al. (2005) detected APP1 expression in all
human tissues examined with high expression in pancreas, liver, kidney,
and testis. There was fairly uniform expression in T cells, B cells, and
monocytes. APP1 functions as a soluble cytosolic homodimer of about 70
kD and exhibits broad substrate specificity.

GENE FUNCTION

Oh et al. (2004) described a hypothesis-driven, systems biology approach
to identifying a small subset of proteins induced at the tissue-blood
interface that are inherently accessible to antibodies injected
intravenously. They used subcellular fractionation, subtractive
proteomics, and bioinformatics to identify endothelial cell surface
proteins exhibiting restricted tissue distribution and apparent tissue
modulation. Expression profiling and gamma-scintigraphic imaging with
antibodies established 2 of these proteins, aminopeptidase-P and annexin
A1 (151690), as selective in vivo targets for antibodies in lung and
solid tumors, respectively. Radioimmunotherapy to annexin A1 destroyed
tumors and increased animal survival.

MAPPING

Using FISH and somatic hybrid analysis, Sprinkle et al. (2000) mapped
the XPNPEPL gene to chromosome 10q25.3, distinct from the Xq25
localization of XPNPEP2.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Associations Pending Confirmation

To identify loci contributing to susceptibility to biliary atresia
(210500), characterized by the progressive fibrosclerosing obliteration
of the extrahepatic biliary system during the first few weeks of life,
Garcia-Barcelo et al. (2010) carried out a genomewide association study
(GWAS) using nearly 500,000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in
200 Chinese biliary atresia patients and 481 ethnically matched control
subjects. The 10 most associated SNPs from the GWAS were genotyped in an
independent set of 124 BA and 90 control subjects. The strongest overall
association was found for dbSNP rs17095355 on chromosome 10q24, 68 kb
downstream from XPNPEP1.

120550	TITLE *120550 COMPLEMENT COMPONENT 1, q SUBCOMPONENT, A CHAIN; C1QA
;;COMPLEMENT COMPONENT 1, q SUBCOMPONENT, ALPHA POLYPEPTIDE;;
COMPLEMENT COMPONENT C1q, A CHAIN;;
SERUM C1q
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The first component of complement is a calcium-dependent complex of the
3 subcomponents C1q, C1r (613785), and C1s (120580). Subcomponent C1q
binds to immunoglobulin complexes with resulting serial activation of
C1r (enzyme), C1s (proenzyme), and the other 8 components of complement.
C1q is composed of 3 different species of chains, called A, B (C1QB;
120570), and C (C1QC; 120575).

For a review of the complement system and its components, see Degn et
al. (2011).

CLONING

Reid (1974) reported a partial amino acid sequence of 95 residues of the
191 residues in the oxidized A chain of human subcomponent C1q. This
region of the A chain contains a repeating sequence of glycine-X-Y,
where X is often proline and Y is often hydroxyproline, for 78 residues.
The 5 hydroxylysine residues and 5 hydroxyproline residues in the
oxidized A chain are all in these 78 residues and only in the Y position
of the repeating sequence. Prolonged collagenase digestion of the
oxidized A chain yielded a large, apparently C-terminal peptide
containing most of the noncollagenous sequences present in the chain.
Reid (1974) concluded that the A chain of C1q contains a collagen-like
region that constitutes most of the N-terminal half of the chain.

Hedge et al. (1987) isolated a cDNA clone for the A chain of C1q from a
human monocyte cDNA library using a variety of synthetic
oligonucleotides as probes.

GENE FUNCTION

Bing et al. (1982) showed that fibronectin binds to C1q in the same
manner that it binds collagen. A major function of fibronectins is in
adhesion of cells to extracellular materials, such as solid substrata
and matrices. Because fibronectin stimulates endocytosis and promotes
clearance of particulate material from circulation, the results of Bing
et al. (1982) suggest that fibronectin functions in clearance of
C1q-coated material, such as immune complexes or cellular debris.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid analysis, Hedge et al. (1987) assigned the gene
for the A chain of C1q to chromosome 1p, where the gene for the B chain
had been assigned previously. The genes for the A, B, and C chains of
C1q are tandemly arranged 5-prime to 3-prime in the order A-C-B on a
24-kb stretch of DNA (Sellar et al., 1991). A and C are separated by 4
kb and B and C are separated by 11 kb. Hybridization of cDNA probes to a
hybrid cell line containing the derived X chromosome from an
X;1(q21.2;p34) translocation described in a female patient with Duchenne
muscular dystrophy (Lindenbaum et al., 1979; Boyd et al., 1988) showed
that the A and B genes are located in the region 1p36.3-p34.1 (Sellar et
al., 1992).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In patients with C1q deficiency (613652), Topaloglu et al. (1996) and
Petry et al. (1997) identified the same homozygous mutation in the C1QA
gene (120550.0001).

ANIMAL MODEL

The complement system plays a paradoxical role in development and
expression of autoimmunity in humans. The activation of complement in
SLE contributes to tissue injury. In contrast, inherited deficiency of
classic pathway components, particularly C1q, is probably associated
with development of SLE. This leads to the hypothesis that a physiologic
action of the early part of the classic pathway protects against
development of SLE and implies that C1q may play a key role in this
respect. Botto et al. (1998) generated C1q-deficient (C1qa -/-) mice by
gene targeting and monitored them for 8 months. C1qa -/- mice had
increased mortality and higher titers of autoantibodies, compared with
strain-matched controls. Of the C1qa -/- mice, 25% had
glomerulonephritis with immune deposits and multiple apoptotic cell
bodies. Among mice without glomerulonephritis, there were significantly
greater numbers of glomerular apoptotic bodies in C1q-deficient mice
compared with controls. The phenotype associated with C1q deficiency was
modified by background genes. These findings are compatible with the
hypothesis that C1q deficiency causes autoimmunity by impairment of the
clearance of apoptotic cells.

Formation of mature neural circuits during development requires
selective elimination of inappropriate synaptic connections. Using
RT-PCR, in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemistry, Stevens et al.
(2007) found that mouse C1q was expressed by postnatal neurons in
response to immature astrocytes and was localized to synapses throughout
the postnatal central nervous system (CNS) and retina. Mice lacking C1q
(C1qa -/-) or the downstream complement protein C3 (120700), exhibited
large, sustained defects in CNS synapse elimination. Neuronal C1q was
downregulated in the CNS in adulthood. However, in a mouse model of
glaucoma (see 137750), C1q exhibited upregulated expression and
relocalization to adult retina early in the disease. Stevens et al.
(2007) concluded that unwanted synapses are tagged by components of the
classical complement cascade for elimination, and they proposed that
complement-mediated synapse elimination may be aberrantly reactivated in
neurodegenerative disease.

Lewis et al. (2009) generated mice lacking C1qa and/or serum IgM
(147020) as well as Ldlr (606945) and studied them on both low- and
high-fat semisynthetic diets. On both diets, serum IgM/Ldlr -/- mice
developed substantially larger and more complex en face and aortic root
atherosclerotic lesions, with accelerated cholesterol crystal formation
and increased smooth muscle content in aortic root lesions. TUNEL
analysis revealed increased apoptosis in both C1qa/Ldlr -/- and serum
IgM/Ldlr -/- mice. Overall lesions were larger in mice lacking IgM
rather than C1q, suggesting that IgM protective mechanisms are partially
independent of classic complement pathway activation and apoptotic cell
clearance. Lewis et al. (2009) concluded that IgM antibodies play a
central role in protection against atherosclerosis.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
C1q DEFICIENCY
C1QA, GLN186TER

In 2 sibs with homozygous C1q deficiency (613652), Topaloglu et al.
(1996) identified homozygosity for a C-to-T transition in codon 186 of
the A chain that resulted in a gln-to-stop (Q186X) substitution. The
mutation was present in heterozygous state in both parents and in 2
unaffected sibs. Topaloglu et al. (1996) stated that the same mutation
had been described in an affected member of a Slovakian family with C1q
deficiency by Petry et al. (1995).

Petry et al. (1997) identified homozygosity for the Q186X mutation in
affected members of 3 Turkish families. In 1 family, an asymptomatic
sister of the proband was also found to be homozygous for the mutation.
Petry et al. (1997) hypothesized that this defective allele is present
in the population of southeast Europe and Turkey.

613504	TITLE *613504 ZINC FINGER FYVE DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 21; ZFYVE21
;;ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 21; ZF21
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using RT-PCR, Nagano et al. (2010) cloned ZFYVE21, which they called
ZF21, from an HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cDNA library. The deduced
234-amino acid protein contains a phosphatidylinositol
3-phosphate-binding FYVE domain in its N-terminal half. Nagano et al.
(2010) also identified a ZF21 splice variant that encodes a deduced
252-amino acid protein. Western blot analysis detected variable
expression of Zf21 in all mouse tissues examined. Expression of the
smaller ZF21 isoform predominated in all human cell lines examined. The
apparent molecular mass of endogenous ZF21 in HT1080 cells was 27 kD.
Biochemical fractionation and immunohistochemical analysis revealed a
vesicle-like distribution for ZF21 and colocalization with EEA1
(605070), an endosome marker protein. Fluorescence microscopy revealed
that ZF21 also colocalized with the focal adhesion marker talin (TLN1;
186745) at the cell surface.

GENE FUNCTION

Nagano et al. (2010) characterized the shorter isoform of ZF21. Using
domain analysis, they showed that the FYVE domain of ZF21 was required
for its membrane localization. Knockdown of ZF21 in human cell lines via
small hairpin RNA increased cell adherence to fibronectin (FN1; 135600),
collagen I (see COL1A1; 120150), and vitronectin (VTN; 193190), but not
poly-L-lysine, and reduced cell motility. Knockdown of ZF21 was
associated with enhanced cell surface expression of integrin beta-1
(ITGB1; 135630) and increased number of focal adhesions. ZF21 did not
affect formation of focal adhesions, but appeared to regulate their
disassembly. Protein pull-down analysis showed that ZF21 interacted with
the focal adhesion protein FAK (PTK2; 600758), and domain analysis
revealed that the FYVE domain of ZF21 interacted with the kinase domain
FAK. Nagano et al. (2010) showed that ZF21 dephosphorylated tyr397 of
FAK, an event crucial for the induction of focal adhesion disassembly.
Dephosphorylation of FAK tyr397 was delayed in ZF21-knockdown cells.
Nagano et al. (2010) concluded that ZF21 regulates focal adhesion
disassembly by initiating microtubule-induced dephosphorylation of FAK
and permitting cell motility.

MAPPING

Hartz (2010) mapped the ZFYVE21 gene to chromosome 14q32.33 based on an
alignment of the ZFYVE21 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC001130) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

607796	TITLE *607796 PHD FINGER PROTEIN 11; PHF11
;;NY-REN-34
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using autologous antibody, Scanlan et al. (1999) cloned PHF11, which
they designated NY-REN-34, from a clear-cell renal carcinoma cDNA
library. The deduced 191-amino acid protein contains a zinc finger
motif. RT-PCR detected expression in all normal tissues tested,
including lung, testis, small intestine, breast, liver, and placenta.

Using a positional cloning approach, Zhang et al. (2003) cloned PHF11
from a quantitative trait locus on chromosome 13q14 that influences
immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels and asthma (147050). PCR analysis detected
several splice variants, 1 of which was expressed in all tissues
examined. A variant utilizing an alternative exon 1 was expressed in
immune-related tissues and cells. Variants utilizing 2 alternative exons
following exon 5, both of which contain premature stop codons, were
detected only in lung and unactivated peripheral blood leukocytes, but
not in activated cells.

- PHF11/SETDB2 Fusion Transcripts

Using primers designed from exons utilized by SETDB2 (607865) and PHF11,
Zhang et al. (2003) amplified PCR products that spanned both and
represented 3 alternatively spliced fusion transcripts. Expression of
each transcript was tissue specific and was detected in nearly all
tissues examined.

GENE STRUCTURE

Zhang et al. (2003) determined that the PHF11 gene contains 10 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Scanlan et al. (1999) mapped the PHF11
gene to chromosome 13. Zhang et al. (2003) mapped the PHF11 gene to
chromosome 13q14. The SETDB2 gene is 4 kb proximal to the PHF11 gene and
is transcribed in the same direction.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Atopic or IgE-mediated diseases include the common disorders of asthma
(600807), atopic dermatitis (603165), and allergic rhinitis (607154).
Chromosome 13q14 shows consistent linkage to atopy and total serum IgE
concentration. Anderson et al. (2002) identified association between
total serum IgE levels and a novel 13q14 microsatellite (USAT24G1).
Zhang et al. (2003) localized the underlying quantitative trait locus
(QTL) in a comprehensive single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) map. They
found replicated association to IgE levels that was attributed to
several alleles in PHF11. They also found association with these
variants to severe clinical asthma.
