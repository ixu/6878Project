611927	TITLE *611927 FAMILY WITH SEQUENCE SIMILARITY, MEMBER H; FAM83H
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing genes within a region of chromosome 8q24.3 that was linked
to a form of hypocalcified amelogenesis imperfecta (AI3; 130900) in a
Korean family, Kim et al. (2008) identified causative mutations in the
FAM83H gene. FAM83H encodes a deduced 1,179-amino acid protein with a
calculated molecular mass of 127 kD. RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that
FAM83H is expressed in ameloblasts and odontoblasts. EST database
analysis indicated ubiquitous expression of FAM83H in human tissues.

Using in situ hybridization, Lee et al. (2009) detected Fam83h
expression in mouse ameloblasts during the presecretory to the secretory
stages of tooth development. Fam83h was also expressed in odontoblasts
and developing alveolar bone. Based on its expression pattern, Lee et
al. (2009) suggested that FAM83H may be involved in differentiation of
preameloblasts into functional ameloblasts and in enamel matrix
calcification.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kim et al. (2008) determined that the FAM83H gene contains 5 exons.

GENE FUNCTION

FAM83H is required for proper dental enamel calcification (Kim et al.,
2008).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of 2 Korean kindreds with autosomal dominant
hypocalcified amelogenesis imperfecta mapping to chromosome 8q24.3, Kim
et al. (2008) identified heterozygous nonsense mutations in the FAM83H
gene: R325X (611927.0001) and Q398X (611927.0002). The mutations
cosegregated perfectly with the disease phenotype.

In affected members of 4 families with amelogenesis imperfecta type III
previously reported by Kim et al. (2006), Lee et al. (2008) identified 4
nonsense mutations in the FAM83H gene (611927.0003-611927.0006). The
mutations were all in the last exon of the gene and deleted between 503
and 883 amino acids from the C terminus of the protein.

Wright et al. (2009) described 6 mutations in the FAM83H gene in 7
families with autosomal dominant hypocalcified amelogenesis imperfecta,
which they symbolized ADHCAI. Affected individuals with truncating
mutations of 677 or fewer amino acids presented with a generalized
ADHCAI phenotype, whereas those with mutations capable of producing a
protein of at least 694 amino acids (611927.0009, 611927.0010) had an
attenuated, localized ADHCAI phenotype.

In affected members of 8 Turkish families with autosomal dominant
hypocalcified amelogenesis imperfecta, Hart et al. (2009) identified
heterozygous nonsense mutations in exon 5 of the FAM83H gene in all. One
of the mutations (Q456X; 611927.0013) occurred in 6 of the families.
Based on haplotype analysis, the mutation appeared to be a founder
mutation in 5 of the families and a de novo mutation in the other. Hart
et al. (2009) noted that all of the FAM83H mutations identified in AI3
thus far were nonsense mutations that clustered within a 380-amino acid
region, supporting a dominant-negative effect.

;;BNIP2-SIMILAR; BNIPS;;
BNIPL1;;
BNIPL2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database analysis using full-length BNIP2 (603292) or its BNIP2 and
CDC42GAP (ARHGAP1; 602732) homology (BCH) domain as probe, followed by
5-prime RACE of human kidney epithelial cells, Zhou et al. (2002) cloned
BNIPL, which they called BNIPS. They identified 2 alternative splicing
isoforms, a deduced 275-amino acid BNIPS-alpha isoform and a deduced
204-amino acid BNIPS-beta isoform. The BNIPS-alpha isoform shared 46%
identity with BNIP2 with higher similarity over the BCH domain, which is
predicted to comprise several alpha helices. PCR analysis detected
differing levels of expression of the BNIPS-alpha and BNIPS-beta
isoforms in a number of human cancer cell lines including breast cancer
MCF-7, HeLa cells, 293T embryonic transformed kidney epithelial cells,
and stomach and colon cancer cell lines. PCR analysis of mouse tissues
detected expression of BNIPS-alpha in all tissues examined.
Immunofluorescence studies localized the BNIPS-alpha isoform to the
cytosol and BNIPS-beta primarily to the nucleus.

Using a high-throughput transfection screen for suppressors of cell
growth from a human placental cDNA library, followed by 5-prime RACE,
Qin et al. (2003) independently cloned BNIPL. They identified 2
alternatively spliced isoforms that used different start codons: a
deduced 275-amino acid isoform, BNIPL1, isoform identical to the
BNIPS-alpha isoform isolated by Zhou et al. (2002) and a longer
357-amino acid isoform, BNIPL2, containing 82 additional N-terminal
amino acids, followed by the 275-amino acid sequence identical to
BNIPL1. By Northern blot analysis of human tissues, Shen et al. (2003)
detected a 2.4-kb BNIPL transcript in placenta and lung.

GENE FUNCTION

Zhou et al. (2002) showed that overexpression of the BNIPS-alpha isoform
in human breast cancer cells caused cell rounding, which was accompanied
by annexin V (ANXA5; 131230) binding, cell shrinkage, and detachment.
BNIPS-beta showed no change in cell morphology. The BCH domain was
required for proapoptotic activity. Zhou et al. (2002) concluded that
BNIPS-alpha induces apoptosis.

Using yeast 2-hybrid and pull-down affinity studies, Qin et al. (2003)
showed that the BCH domain of the BNIPL2 isoform interacted with Bcl2
(151430), Cdc42GAP, and with itself. They demonstrated that the BCH
domain was responsible for the ability of BNIPL2 to suppress GAP
activity of Cdc42GAP toward CDC42 (116952) and for the proapoptotic
function of BNIPL2. Shen et al. (2003) showed that overexpression of
BNIPL inhibited cell growth in human hepatocarcinoma cells. Using in
vivo and in vitro assays, they found that BNIPL interacted with MIF
(153620) and GFER (600924).

GENE STRUCTURE

Qin et al. (2003) determined that the BNIPL gene contains 10 exons.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Qin et al. (2003) mapped the BNIPL gene to
chromosome 1q21.1.

EOTAXIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Chemoattractant cytokines (chemokines) play an important role in the
recruitment of leukocytes to inflammatory lesions. Interleukin-8
(146930) is predominantly a neutrophil chemoattractant, whereas monocyte
chemotactic protein-1 (MCP1, or CCL2; 158105) serves predominantly as a
monocyte and T-cell chemoattractant. Ponath et al. (1996) noted that the
striking accumulation of eosinophils in certain tissues, particularly in
response to parasitic infection and also as a result of IGE-mediated
reactions such as rhinitis and allergic asthma, suggests that there may
be factors that are chemotactic specifically for eosinophils. The
chemokine termed eotaxin was identified as the predominant eosinophil
chemoattractant in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of allergen-challenged
guinea pigs. Ponath et al. (1996) cloned a human homolog of guinea pig
eotaxin. Human eotaxin mediated the selective migration of eosinophils,
both in vitro and in vivo. Human eotaxin was found to be 61.8% and 63.2%
identical to guinea pig and mouse eotaxin, respectively. Radiolabeled
eotaxin was used to identify a high-affinity receptor on eosinophils.
This receptor also bound RANTES (187011) and monocyte chemotactic
protein-3 (CCL7; 158106). The same gene was isolated by Kitaura et al.
(1996), who showed that the recombinantly expressed protein induced a
calcium flux response in human eosinophils but not in either neutrophils
or monocytes. They showed that the response was mediated through the CC
chemokine receptor-3 (CCR3; 601268), a G protein-coupled receptor
expressed in eosinophils.

GENE FUNCTION

Eotaxin is a potent inducer of eosinophil chemotaxis leading to
eosinophil migration in vitro and accumulation in vivo. These effects
are mediated via CCR3, which is highly expressed on eosinophils,
basophils, and TH2 lymphocytes and, thus, is involved in allergic
inflammation. Ogilvie et al. (2001) showed that eotaxin also interacts
with CCR2 (601267) and CCR5 (601373) and can thus affect the responses
of monocytes, which express both receptors. In human monocytes, they
found that pretreatment with eotaxin decreased responsiveness to MCP1, a
selective ligand for CCR2, as well as to RANTES and MIP1-beta (182284),
which bind to CCR5. These and other results from the study demonstrated
that eotaxin is a CCR5 agonist and a CCR2 antagonist. The authors
suggested that eotaxin has a role in the fine-tuning of cellular
responses occurring at sites of allergic inflammation, in which both
MCP1 and eotaxin are produced.

Salcedo et al. (2001) showed that CCL11 induces CCR3-expressing
endothelial cell migration in vitro and angiogenesis in vivo, as well as
endothelial cell sprouting from aortic rings in the absence of an
eosinophil infiltrate. They suggested that CCL11 may contribute to
angiogenesis in conditions accompanied by eosinophil infiltration such
as Hodgkin lymphoma (236000), nasal polyposis, endometriosis, and
allergic diathesis.

Menzies-Gow et al. (2002) used immunohistological analysis to examined
the effects of intradermal injection of eotaxin and eotaxin-2 (CCL24;
602495), both of which act through CCR3, into human atopic and nonatopic
skin. Both chemokines produced a dose- and time-dependent local
eosinophilia of comparable intensity and an acute wheal and flare
response regardless of atopy status. Basophils and neutrophils also
accumulated at the injection sites. Menzies-Gow et al. (2002) concluded
that the eosinophilic and inflammatory cell infiltrate induced by
eotaxins is consistent with CC chemokine-induced mast cell
degranulation.

Villeda et al. (2011) used heterochronic parabiosis to demonstrate that
blood-borne factors present in the systemic milieu can inhibit or
promote adult neurogenesis in an age-dependent fashion in mice.
Accordingly, exposing a young mouse to an old systemic environment or to
plasma from old mice decreased synaptic plasticity, and impaired
contextual fear conditioning and spatial learning and memory. Villeda et
al. (2011) identified chemokines, including CCL11, the plasma levels of
which correlated with reduced neurogenesis in heterochronic parabionts
and aged mice, and the levels of which are increased in the plasma and
cerebrospinal fluid of healthy aging humans. Lastly, increasing
peripheral CCL11 chemokine levels in vivo in young mice decreased adult
neurogenesis and impaired learning and memory. Villeda et al. (2011)
concluded that the decline in neurogenesis and cognitive impairments
observed during aging can be in part attributed to changes in
blood-borne factors.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hein et al. (1997) cloned SCYA11 genomic sequence, including the coding
region and 3 kb of DNA immediately 5-prime of the coding region. The
SCYA11 gene has 3 exons. The authors identified a number of consensus
regulatory elements in the 5-prime flanking region of the SCYA11 gene
that potentially regulate SCYA11 gene expression and/or mediate the
effects of antiinflammatory drugs.

MAPPING

Kitaura et al. (1996) mapped the SCYA11 gene to chromosome 17 using a
somatic cell hybrid DNA panel. By FISH, Garcia-Zepeda et al. (1997)
mapped the SCYA11 gene to 17q21.1-q21.2.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

The eotaxin gene family (eotaxin 1; eotaxin 2; and eotaxin 3, 604697)
recruits and activates CCR3-bearing cells such as eosinophils, mast
cells, and Th2 lymphocytes that play a major role in allergic disorders.
Shin et al. (2003) genotyped a 721-member asthma (600807) cohort at 17
polymorphisms among the 3 eotaxin loci. Statistical analysis revealed
that the eotaxin 2 +1272A-G G* allele showed significantly lower
frequency in asthmatics than in normal healthy controls (0.14 vs 0.23, P
= 0.002), and that distribution of the eotaxin 2 +1272A-G G*
allele-containing genotypes was also much lower in asthmatics (26.3 vs
40.8%, P = 0.003). In addition, a nonsynonymous SNP in eotaxin 1,
+123Ala to Thr, showed significant association with total serum IgE
levels (P = 0.002-0.02) (see 147050). The effect of eotaxin 1 +123Ala to
Thr on total serum IgE appeared in a gene dose-dependent manner. The
authors suggested that the development of asthma may be associated with
eotaxin 2 +1272A-G polymorphisms, and the susceptibility to high IgE
production may be attributed to the eotaxin 1 +123Ala to Thr
polymorphism. In an erratum, the authors noted that the first base of
the translation start site of the eotaxin 2 genomic reference sequence
had been denoted as +1, introducing some errors in the numbering of the
eotaxin 2 SNPs.

Modi et al. (2003) identified 3 SNPs that formed a 31-kb haplotype (H7;
see 601156.0001) spanning the CCL2-CCL7-CCL11 gene cluster on chromosome
17q. The SNPs and the H7 haplotype were significantly associated with
protection from HIV-1 infection (see 609423).

Batra et al. (2007) analyzed 3 polymorphisms in the CCL11 gene and a
hexanucleotide (GAAGGA)n repeat (601156.0002) located 10.9 kb upstream
of the gene in 235 patients with asthma and 239 age-, sex-, and
ethnically matched controls and in 230 families with asthma from
northern India. The authors found a highly significant association of
the hexanucleotide repeat with asthma (p = 3 x 10(-6)).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS TYPE 1, RESISTANCE TO
CCL11, -1385G-A

Modi et al. (2003) genotyped 9 SNPs spanning the CCL2 (158105)-CCL7
(158106)-CCL11 gene cluster on chromosome 17q in more than 3,000 DNA
samples from 5 AIDS cohorts (see 609423). Extensive linkage
disequilibrium was observed, particularly for 3 SNPs, -2136T in the CCL2
promoter (158105.0001), 767G in intron 1 of the CCL2 gene (158105.0002),
and -1385A in the CCL11 promoter, that formed a 31-kb haplotype (H7)
containing the 3 genes. The frequencies of these 3 SNPs and the H7
haplotype were significantly elevated in uninfected individuals
repeatedly exposed to HIV-1 through high-risk sexual behavior or
contaminated blood products. Since these chemokines do not bind the
primary HIV-1 coreceptors CCR5 (601373) or CXCR4 (162643), Modi et al.
(2003) proposed that the influence of the H7 haplotype on HIV-1
transmission may result from activation of the immune system rather than
receptor blockage.

.0002
ASTHMA, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
CCL11, (GAAGGA)n

Batra et al. (2007) studied 235 patients with asthma (600807) and 239
age-, sex-, and ethnically matched controls and 230 families with asthma
from northern India and found a significant association between a
polymorphic hexanucleotide (GAAGGA)n repeat, located 10.9 kb upstream of
the CCL11 gene, and asthma (p = 3 x 10(-6)). The hexanucleotide repeat
was also associated with total serum IgE levels (p = 0.006) and eotaxin
levels (p = 0.004).

603356	TITLE *603356 CD164 ANTIGEN; CD164
;;SIALOMUCIN CD164;;
ENDOLYN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Sialomucins are a heterogeneous group of secreted or membrane-associated
mucins that appear to play 2 key but opposing roles in vivo: first as
cytoprotective or antiadhesive agents, and second as adhesion receptors.
CD164 is a type I integral transmembrane sialomucin that functions as an
adhesion receptor (Watt et al., 1998; Forde et al., 2007).

CLONING

Using 2 monoclonal antibodies and a retroviral expression cloning
strategy, Zannettino et al. (1998) isolated a cDNA encoding a novel
transmembrane isoform of the mucin-like glycoprotein MGC24, which they
designated CD164. The mature CD164 protein contains 178 amino acids, has
a molecular mass of 80 to 90 kD, and is extremely rich in serine and
threonine. CD164 was expressed by human CD34 (142230)-positive
hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs).

GENE FUNCTION

Zannettino et al. (1998) found that the CD164 receptor appeared to play
a role in hematopoiesis by facilitating adhesion of CD34-positive cells
to bone marrow stroma and by negatively regulating CD34-positive HPC
growth. These functional effects were mediated by at least 2 spatially
distinct epitopes, defined by specific monoclonal antibodies. Watt et
al. (1998) found that these and other CD164 monoclonal antibodies showed
distinct patterns of reactivity when analyzed on hematopoietic cells
from normal human bone marrow, umbilical cord blood, and peripheral
blood. Expression of the CD164 epitope was found on developing
myelomonocytic cells in bone marrow, being downregulated on mature
neutrophils but maintained on monocytes in the peripheral blood.

Using CD133 (PROM1; 604365)-positive HPCs and a T-cell line, Forde et
al. (2007) demonstrated that CD164 associated with CXCR4 (162643).
Antibody to the CD164 N-linked glycan-dependent epitope or CD164
knockdown via small interfering RNA inhibited migration of
CD133-positive HPCs toward CXCL12 (600835), the CXCR4 ligand. CXCL12, in
association with fibronectin (FN1; 135600), induced association of CD164
with CXCR4 following association of CXCR4 with the fibronectin receptors
VLA4 (see ITGA4; 192975) and VLA5 (see ITGA5; 135620). CD164-CXCR4
association coincided with PKC-zeta (PRKCZ; 176982) and AKT (164730)
signaling through CXCR4. Forde et al. (2007) concluded that an
association among 3 distinct families of cell surface receptors,
including CD164, regulates cell migratory responses and probably lends
specificity to the homing and lodging of these cells within bone marrow.

MAPPING

Watt et al. (1998) identified PAC clones containing the CD164 gene and
used these clones to localize the CD164 gene to chromosome 6q21 by FISH.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Histones are small, highly basic proteins that consist of a globular
domain with unstructured N- and C-terminal tails protruding from the
main structure. The histone family contains the core histones H2A (see
613499), H2B (see 609904), H3, and H4 (see 602822) and the linker
histone H1 (see 142709). Two full turns of eukaryotic DNA are tightly
packaged and ordered in nucleosomes, which consist of an octamer formed
by 2 each of the core histones. Nucleosomes are the fundamental unit of
chromatin. Histone H1 binds the linker DNA between nucleosomes, thereby
increasing the overall stability of chromatin by forming higher order
structures. In addition to their role in DNA compartmentalization,
histones also play crucial roles in various biologic processes,
including gene expression and regulation, DNA repair, chromatin
condensation, cell cycle progression, chromosome segregation, and
apoptosis. The ability of histones to regulate chromatin dynamics
primarily originates from various posttranslational modifications
carried out by histone-modifying enzymes. HIST1H3A is a core histone H3
(summary by Marzluff et al. (2002) and Healy et al. (2012)).

For additional background information on histones, histone gene
clusters, and the H3 histone family, see GENE FAMILY below.

GENE FAMILY

Like other histones, H3 histones can be subgrouped according to their
temporal expression. Replication-dependent histones, such as HIST1H3A
through HIST1H3J (602817), HIST2H3C (142780), and HIST3H3 (602820) are
mainly expressed during S phase. In contrast, replication-independent
histones, or replacement variant histones, such as H3F3A (601128) and
H3F3B (601058), can be expressed throughout the cell cycle. Most
replication-dependent H3 histone genes, as well as other core histone
genes, are located within histone gene cluster-1 (HIST1) on chromosome
6p22-p21. Two other histone gene clusters, HIST2 and HIST3, are located
on chromosomes 1q21 and 1q42, respectively, and each contains at least 1
replication-dependent H3 histone gene. In mouse, the Hist1, Hist2, and
Hist3 gene clusters are located on chromosomes 13A2-A3, 3F1-F2, and
11B2, respectively. All replication-dependent histone genes are
intronless, and they encode mRNAs that lack a poly(A) tail, ending
instead in a conserved stem-loop sequence. Unlike replication-dependent
histone genes, replication-independent histone genes are solitary genes
that are located on chromosomes apart from any other H1 or core histone
genes. Some replication-independent histone genes contain introns and
encode mRNAs with poly(A) tails. All H3 histone genes in the HIST1
cluster encode the same protein, designated H3.1. The H3 histone gene in
the HIST2 cluster, HIST2H3C, encodes a protein designated H3.2, which
differs from H3.1 only at residue 96, which is a cysteine in H3.1 and a
serine in H3.2. The H3 histone gene in the HIST3 cluster, HIST3H3,
encodes a protein that contains ser96 and 4 other changes relative to
H3.1 and H3.2. The replication-independent H3 histone genes, H3F3A and
H3F3B, encode the same protein, designated H3.3, which is distinct from
H3.1 and H3.2 (summary by Marzluff et al. (2002)).

CLONING

By genomic sequence analysis, Marzluff et al. (2002) identified the
mouse and human HIST1H3A genes. They noted that all H3 genes in the
HIST1 cluster, including HIST1H3A, encode the same protein, designated
H3.1. H3.1 differs from H3.2, which is encoded by HIST2H3C (142780), at
only 1 residue, and from histone H3.3, which is encoded by both H3F3A
(601128) and H3F3B (601058), at a few residues.

MAPPING

By analysis of a YAC contig from chromosome 6p21.3, Albig et al. (1997)
characterized a cluster of 35 histone genes that included H3/a.

By genomic sequence analysis, Marzluff et al. (2002) determined that the
HIST1 cluster on chromosome 6p22-p21 contains 55 histone genes,
including 10 H3 genes. The HIST1H3A gene is the most telomeric H3 gene
within the HIST1 cluster. The HIST1 cluster spans over 2 Mb and includes
2 large gaps (over 250 kb each) where there are no histone genes, but
many other genes. The organization of histone genes in the mouse Hist1
cluster on chromosome 13A2-A3 is essentially identical to that in human
HIST1. The HIST2 cluster on chromosome 1q21 contains 6 histone genes,
including 1 H3 gene (HIST2H3C; 142780), and the HIST3 cluster on
chromosome 1q42 contains 3 histone genes, including 1 H3 gene (HIST3H3;
602820). Hist2 and Hist3 are located on mouse chromosomes 3F1-F2 and
11B2, respectively.

GENE FUNCTION

- H3.1 Histone

Hake et al. (2006) noted that most studies on expression or
posttranslational modifications of H3 histones do not differentiate
between the H3.1, H3.2, and H3.3 proteins, in part due to their high
degree of amino acid identity. By quantitative PCR of 5 human cell
lines, they found that the 9 H3.1 genes, 1 H3.2 gene, and 2 H3.3 genes
examined were expressed in a cell line-specific manner. All 3 types of
H3 genes were highly expressed during S phase in human cell lines,
whereas the H3.3 genes were also highly expressed outside of S phase,
consistent with their status as replication-independent genes. Using a
combination of isotopic labeling and quantitative tandem mass
spectrometry, Hake et al. (2006) showed that the H3.1, H3.2, and H3.3
proteins differed in their posttranslational modifications. H3.1 was
enriched in marks associated with both gene activation and gene
silencing, H3.2 was enriched in repressive marks associated with gene
silencing and the formation of facultative heterochromatin, and H3.3 was
enriched in marks associated with transcriptional activation. Hake et
al. (2006) concluded that H3.1, H3.2, and H3.3 likely have unique
functions and should not be treated as equivalent proteins.

Xu et al. (2010) reported that significant amounts of histone H3.3-H4
tetramers split in vivo, whereas most H3.1-H4 tetramers remain intact
during mitotic division. Inhibiting DNA replication-dependent deposition
greatly reduced the level of splitting events, which suggested that (i)
the replication-independent H3.3 deposition pathway proceeds largely by
cooperatively incorporating 2 new H3.3-H4 dimers, and (ii) the majority
of splitting events occurred during replication-dependent deposition. Xu
et al. (2010) concluded that 'silent' histone modifications within large
heterochromatic regions are maintained by copying modifications from
neighboring preexisting histones without the need for H3-H4 splitting
events.

Talbert and Henikoff (2010) reviewed the assembly of canonical
nucleosomes, which is thought to begin with a tetramer of 2 H3 molecules
and 2 H4 molecules held together by strong bonds between the H3
molecules. H3.1 is the major canonical H3 assembled into chromatin by
the histone chaperone CAF1 (see 601246) complex during DNA replication
and repair. The replacement histone H3.3 is assembled by the histone
regulator A (HIRA; 600237) complex independently of DNA synthesis.

- Methylation and Demethylation of H3 Histones

Eukaryotic genomes are organized into discrete structural and functional
chromatin domains. Noma et al. (2001) demonstrated that distinct
site-specific histone H3 methylation patterns define euchromatic and
heterochromatic chromosomal domains within an 47-kb region of the mating
type locus in fission yeast. H3 methylated at lysine-9 (H3K9), and its
interacting Swi6 protein, are strictly localized to a 20-kb silent
heterochromatic interval. In contrast, H3 methylated at lysine-4 (H3K4)
is specific to the surrounding euchromatic regions. Two inverted repeats
flanking the silent interval serve as boundary elements to mark the
borders between heterochromatin and euchromatin. Deletions of these
boundary elements leads to spreading of H3K9 methylation and Swi6 into
neighboring sequences. Furthermore, the H3K9 methylation and
corresponding heterochromatin-associated complexes prevent H3K4
methylation in the silent domain.

Coating of the X chromosome by XIST (314670) RNA is an essential trigger
for X inactivation. Heard et al. (2001) reported that methylation of
lys9 of histone H3 on the inactive X chromosome occurs immediately after
XIST RNA coating and before transcriptional inactivation of X-linked
genes. X-chromosomal H3-lys9 methylation occurs during the same window
of time as H3-lys9 hypoacetylation and H3-lys4 hypomethylation. Histone
H3 modifications thus represent the earliest known chromatin changes
during X inactivation. The authors also identified a unique 'hotspot' of
H3-lys9 methylation 5-prime to XIST and proposed that this acts as a
nucleation center for XIST RNA-dependent spread of inactivation along
the X chromosome via H3-lys9 methylation.

Boggs et al. (2002) and Peters et al. (2002) showed that methylation of
H3 histone at lys9 occurs in facultative heterochromatin of the inactive
X chromosome in female mammals. Posttranslational modifications of
histone amino termini are an important regulatory mechanism that induce
transitions in chromatin structure, thereby contributing to epigenetic
gene control and the assembly of specialized chromosomal subdomains.
Methylation of histone H3 at lys9 by site-specific histone
methyltransferases marks constitutive heterochromatin. Boggs et al.
(2002) found that, in contrast, H3 methylated at lys4 is depleted in the
inactive X chromosome, except in 3 'hotspots' of enrichment along its
length. They could show that lys9 methylation is associated with
promoters of inactive genes, whereas lys4 methylation is associated with
active genes on the X chromosome. The data demonstrated that
differential methylation at 2 distinct sites of the H3 amino terminus
correlates with contrasting gene activities and may be part of a
'histone code' involved in establishing and maintaining facultative
heterochromatin.

Peters et al. (2002) showed H3-lys9 methylation is retained through
mitosis, indicating that it might provide an epigenetic imprint for the
maintenance of the inactive state. Disruption of the 2 site-specific
histone methyltransferases in the mouse abolished H3-lys9 methylation of
constitutive heterochromatin, but not that of the inactive X chromosome.

In Saccharomyces pombe, Volpe et al. (2002) deleted the argonaute
(606228), dicer (606241), and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene
homologs, which encode part of the machinery responsible for RNA
interference. Deletion resulted in the aberrant accumulation of
complementary transcripts from centromeric heterochromatic repeats. This
was accompanied by transcription of derepression of transgenes
integrated at the centromere, loss of histone H3-lys9 methylation, and
impairment of centromere function. Volpe et al. (2002) proposed that
double-stranded RNA arising from centromeric repeats targets formation
and maintenance of heterochromatin through RNA interference.

The higher-order assembly of chromatin imposes structural organization
on the genetic information of eukaryotes and is thought to be largely
determined by posttranslational modification of histone tails. Hall et
al. (2002) studied a 20-kb silent domain at the mating-type region of S.
pombe as a model for heterochromatin formation. They found that although
histone H3 methylated at lys9 directly recruited heterochromatin protein
Swi6/HP1 (604478), the critical determinant for H3-lys9 methylation to
spread in cis to be inherited through mitosis and meiosis is Swi6
itself. The authors demonstrated that a centromere homologous repeat
present at the silent mating-type region is sufficient for
heterochromatin formation at an ectopic site, and that its repressive
capacity is mediated by components of the RNA interference machinery.
Moreover, the centromere homologous repeat and the RNA interference
machinery cooperate to nucleate heterochromatin assembly at the
endogenous mating locus but are dispensable for its subsequent
inheritance. Hall et al. (2002) concluded that their work defines
sequential requirements for the initiation and propagation of regional
heterochromatic domains.

Plath et al. (2003) demonstrated that transient recruitment of the EED
(605984)-EZH2 (601573) complex to the inactive X chromosome occurs
during initiation of X inactivation in both extraembryonic and embryonic
cells and is accompanied by H3 lys27 methylation. Recruitment of the
complex and methylation on the inactive X depend on Xist (314670) RNA
but are independent of its silencing function. Plath et al. (2003)
concluded that taken together, their results suggest a role for
EED-EZH2-mediated H3 lys27 methylation during initiation of both
imprinted and random X inactivation and demonstrate that H3 lys27
methylation is not sufficient for silencing of the inactive X.

Methylation of histone tails has been implicated in long-term epigenetic
memory. Methylated H3K4 is a generally conserved mark for euchromatic,
transcriptionally active regions. Rougeulle et al. (2003) described a
profile of H3K4 dimethylation that was specific for monoallelically
expressed genes. Both X-linked genes subject to X inactivation and
autosomal imprinted genes had dimethylated H3K4 restricted to their
promoter regions. In contrast, high levels of H3K4 dimethylation were
found in both promoters and exonic parts of autosomal genes and of
X-linked genes that escaped X inactivation. Rougeulle et al. (2003)
suggested that this pattern of promoter-restricted H3K4 dimethylation,
already present in totipotent cells, may be causally related to the
long-term programming of allelic expression and may provide an
epigenetic mark for monoallelically expressed genes.

Huyen et al. (2004) found that the tandem tudor domain of 53BP1 (605230)
bound histone H3 methylated on lys79 in vitro. Suppression of DOT1L
(607375), the enzyme that methylates lys79 of histone H3, also inhibited
recruitment of 53BP1 to double-strand breaks. Because methylation of
histone H3 lys79 was unaltered in response to DNA damage, Huyen et al.
(2004) proposed that 53BP1 senses double-strand breaks indirectly
through changes in higher-order chromatin structure that expose the
53BP1 binding site.

Cha et al. (2005) showed that AKT (164730) phosphorylates EZH2 (601573)
at serine-21 and suppresses its methyltransferase activity by impeding
EZH2 binding to histone H3, which results in a decrease of lysine-27
trimethylation and derepression of silenced genes. Cha et al. (2005)
concluded that their results imply that AKT regulates the methylation
activity, through phosphorylation of EZH2, which may contribute to
oncogenesis.

Lee et al. (2005) showed that BHC110 (609132)-containing complexes
showed a near 5-fold increase in demethylation of H3K4 compared to
recombinant BHC110. Furthermore, recombinant BHC110 was unable to
demethylate H3K4 on nucleosomes, but BHC110-containing complexes readily
demethylated nucleosomes. In vitro reconstitution of the BHC complex
using recombinant subunits revealed an essential role for the REST
corepressor CoREST (607675), not only in stimulating demethylation on
core histones but also promoting demethylation of nucleosomal
substrates. Lee et al. (2005) found that nucleosomal demethylation was
the result of CoREST enhancing the association between BHC110 and
nucleosomes. Depletion of CoREST in in vivo cell culture resulted in
derepression of REST-responsive gene expression and increased
methylation of H3K4. Taken together, Lee et al. (2005) concluded that
their results highlight an essential role for CoREST in demethylation of
H3K4 both in vitro and in vivo.

Wysocka et al. (2006) showed that a plant homeodomain (PHD) finger of
nucleosome remodeling factor (NURF), an ISWI-containing ATP-dependent
chromatin-remodeling complex, mediates a direct preferential association
with trimethylated H3K4 tails. Depletion of trimethylated H3K4 causes
partial release of the NURF subunit BPTF (601819) from chromatin and
defective recruitment of the associated ATPase, SNF2L1 (SMARCA1;
300012), to the HOXC8 (142970) promoter. Loss of BPTF in Xenopus embryos
mimics WDR5 (609012) loss-of-function phenotypes, and compromises
spatial control of Hox gene expression. Wysocka et al. (2006) suggested
that WDR5 and NURF function in a common biologic pathway in vivo, and
that NURF-mediated ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling is directly
coupled to H3K4 trimethylation to maintain HOX gene expression patterns
during development.

Shi et al. (2006) identified a novel class of methylated H3K4 effector
domains, the PHD domains of the ING (see 601566) family of tumor
suppressor proteins. The ING PHD domains are specific and highly robust
binding modules for tri- and dimethylated H3K4. ING2 (604215), a native
subunit of a repressive mSin3a (607776)-HDAC1 (601241) histone
deacetylase complex, binds with high affinity to the trimethylated
species. In response to DNA damage, recognition of trimethylated H3K4 by
the ING2 PHD domain stabilizes the mSin3a-HDAC1 complex in promoters of
proliferation genes. In addition, ING2 modulates cellular responses to
genotoxic insults, and these functions are critically dependent on ING2
interaction with trimethylated H3K4. Shi et al. (2006) concluded that
trimethylation of K4 on histone 3 plays a pivotal role in gene
repression and potentially in tumor suppressor mechanisms.

In a search for proteins and complexes interacting with trimethylated
histone H3K9, Cloos et al. (2006) identified JMJD2C (605469). Cloos et
al. (2006) showed that 3 members of the JMJD2 subfamily of proteins
demethylate tri- or dimethylated H3K9 in vitro through a hydroxylation
reaction requiring iron and alpha-ketoglutarate as cofactors. They
demonstrated also that ectopic expression of JMJD2C or other JMJD2
members markedly decreased tri- and dimethylated H3K9 levels, increased
monomethylated H3K9, delocalized HP1 (see 604478), and reduced
heterochromatin in vivo. In agreement with studies indicating a
contribution of JMJD2C to tumor development, inhibition of JMJD2C
expression decreased cell proliferation.

Klose et al. (2006) demonstrated that JMJD2A is capable of removing the
trimethyl group from modified H3K9 and H3K36. Overexpression of JMJD2A
abrogated recruitment of HP1 to heterochromatin, indicating a role for
JMJD2A in antagonizing methylated H3K9 nucleated events. siRNA-mediated
knockdown of JMJD2A led to increased levels of H3K9 methylation and
upregulation of a JMJD2A target gene, ASCL2 (601886), indicating that
JMJD2A may function in euchromatin to remove histone methylation marks
that are associated with active transcription.

Mikkelsen et al. (2007) reported the application of
single-molecule-based sequencing technology for high-throughput
profiling of histone modifications in mammalian cells. By obtaining over
4 billion bases of sequence from chromatin immunoprecipitated DNA, they
generated genomewide chromatin-state maps of mouse embryonic stem cells,
neural progenitor cells, and embryonic fibroblasts. Mikkelsen et al.
(2007) found that H3 lysine-4 and H3 lysine-27 trimethylation
effectively discriminated genes that are expressed, poised for
expression, or stably repressed, and therefore reflected cell state and
lineage potential. H3 lysine-36 trimethylation marks primary coding and
noncoding transcripts, facilitating gene annotation. Trimethylation of
lysine-9 and lysine-20 is detected at satellite, telomeric, and active
long-terminal repeats, and can spread into proximal unique sequences. H3
lysine-4 and lysine-9 trimethylation marks imprinting control regions.
Chromatin state could be read in an allele-specific manner by using
single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Mikkelsen et al. (2007) concluded that
their study provides a framework for the application of comprehensive
chromatin profiling towards characterization of diverse mammalian cell
populations.

Using mass spectrometry, Ooi et al. (2007) identified the main proteins
that interacted in vivo with the product of an epitope-tagged allele of
the endogenous DNMT3L (606588) gene as DNMT3A2 (602769), DNMT3B
(602900), and the 4 core histones. Peptide interaction assays showed
that DNMT3L specifically interacts with the extreme amino terminus of
histone H3; this interaction was strongly inhibited by methylation at
lysine-4 of histone H3 but was insensitive to modifications at other
positions. Crystallographic studies of human DNMT3L showed that the
protein has a carboxy-terminal methyltransferase-like domain and an
N-terminal cysteine-rich domain. Cocrystallization of DNMT3L with the
tail of histone H3 revealed that the tail bound to the cysteine-rich
domain of DNMT3L, and substitution of key residues in the binding site
eliminated the H3 tail-DNMT3L interaction. Ooi et al. (2007) concluded
that DNMT3L recognizes histone H3 tails that are unmethylated at
lysine-4 and induces de novo DNA methylation by recruitment or
activation of DNMT3A2.

Lan et al. (2007) reported that, in contrast to the PHD fingers of the
bromodomain PHD finger transcription factor (BPTF; 601819) and inhibitor
of growth family 2 (ING2; 604215), which bind methylated H3K4, the PHD
finger of BHC80 binds unmethylated H3K4 (H3K4me0), and this interaction
is specifically abrogated by methylation of H3K4. The crystal structure
of the PHD finger of BHC80 bound to an unmodified H3 peptide revealed
the structural basis of the recognition of H3K4me0. Knockdown of BHC80
by RNA inhibition resulted in the derepression of LSD1 target genes, and
this repression was restored by the reintroduction of wildtype BHC80 but
not by a PHD finger mutant that could not bind H3. Chromatin
immunoprecipitation showed that BHC80 and LSD1 depend reciprocally on
one another to associate with chromatin. Lan et al. (2007) concluded
that their findings coupled the function of BHC80 to that of LSD1, and
indicated that unmodified H3K4 is part of the histone code. The authors
further raised the possibility that the generation and recognition of
the unmodified state on histone tails in general might be just as
crucial as posttranslational modifications of histone for chromatin and
transcriptional regulation.

Lee et al. (2007) showed that human UTX (300128), a member of the
Jumonji C family of proteins, is a di- and trimethyl H3K27 demethylase.
UTX occupies the promoters of HOX gene clusters (see 142950) and
regulates their transcriptional output by modulating the recruitment of
polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) and the monoubiquitination of
histone H2A (see 602786). Moreover, UTX associates with mixed-lineage
leukemia (MLL) 2/3 complexes (602113, 606833, respectively), and during
retinoic acid signaling events, the recruitment of the UTX complex to
HOX genes results in H3K27 demethylation and a concomitant methylation
of H3K4. Lee et al. (2007) concluded that their results suggested a
concerted mechanism for transcriptional activation in which cycles of
H3K4 methylation by MLL2/3 are linked with the demethylation of H3K27
through UTX.

The arginine at position 2 of histone H3 (H3R2) is asymmetrically
dimethylated (H3R2me2a) in mammalian cells (Torres-Padilla et al.,
2007). Kirmizis et al. (2007) demonstrated that H3R2 is also methylated
in S. cerevisiae, and by using an antibody specific for H3R2me2a in a
chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-on-chip analysis, they determined
the distribution of this modification on the entire yeast genome. They
found that H3R2me2A is enriched throughout all heterochromatic loci and
inactive euchromatic genes and is present at the 3-prime end of
moderately transcribed genes. In all cases the pattern of H3R2
methylation is mutually exclusive with the trimethyl form of H3K4
(H3K4me3). Kirmizis et al. (2007) showed that methylation at H3R2
abrogates the trimethylation of H3K4 by the Set1 methyltransferase (see
611052). The specific effect on H3K4me3 results from the occlusion of
Spp1, a Set1 methyltransferase subunit necessary for trimethylation.
Kirmizis et al. (2007) concluded that the inability of Spp1 to recognize
H3 methylated at R2 prevents Set1 from trimethylating H3K4. Kirmizis et
al. (2007) stated that their results provided the first mechanistic
insight into the function of arginine methylation on chromatin.

Following up on the observation that asymmetric dimethylation of histone
H3R2 (H3R2me2a) countercorrelates with di- and trimethylation of H3K4
(H3K4me2, H3K4me3) on human promoters, Guccione et al. (2007)
demonstrated that the arginine methyltransferase PRMT6 (608274)
catalyzes H3R2 dimethylation in vitro and controls global levels of
H3R2me2a in vivo. H3R2 methylation by PRMT6 was prevented by the
presence of H3K4me3 on the H3 tail. Conversely, the H3R2me2a mark
prevented methylation of H3K4 as well as binding to the H3 tail by an
ASH2 (604782)/WDR5 (609012)/MLL (159555) family methyltransferase
complex. Chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that H3R2me2a was
distributed within the body and at the 3-prime end of human genes,
regardless of their transcriptional state, whereas it was selectively
and locally depleted from active promoters, coincident with the presence
of H3K4me3. Guccione et al. (2007) concluded that hence, the mutual
antagonism between H3R2 and H3K4 methylation, together with the
association of MLL family complexes with the basal transcription
machinery, may contribute to the localized patterns of H3K4
trimethylation characteristic of transcriptionally poised or active
promoters in mammalian genomes.

Perillo et al. (2008) analyzed how H3 histone methylation and
demethylation control expression of estrogen-responsive genes and showed
that a DNA-bound estrogen receptor (see ESRA, 133430) directs
transcription by participating in bending chromatin to contact the RNA
polymerase II (see 180660) recruited to the promoter. This process is
driven by receptor-targeted demethylation of H3K9 at both enhancer and
promoter sites and is achieved by activation of resident LSD1 (609132)
demethylase. Localized demethylation produces hydrogen peroxide, which
modifies the surrounding DNA and recruits 8-oxoguanine-DNA glycosylase 1
(601982) and topoisomerase II-beta (126431), triggering chromatin and
DNA conformational changes that are essential for estrogen-induced
transcription. Perillo et al. (2008) concluded that their data showed a
strategy that uses controlled DNA damage and repair to guide productive
transcription.

Using high-resolution SNP genotyping to identify regions of genomic gain
and loss in 212 medulloblastoma tumors (155255), Northcott et al. (2009)
identified several focal genetic events in genes targeting histone
methylation at lysine residues, particularly that of H3K9. In vitro
studies showed that restoring expression of genes controlling H3K9
methylation greatly diminished proliferation of medulloblastoma cells.
Northcott et al. (2009) postulated that defective control of the histone
code may contribute to the pathogenesis of medulloblastoma.

Ciccone et al. (2009) demonstrated that KDM1B (613081) functions as a
H3K4 demethylase and is required for de novo DNA methylation of some
imprinted genes in oocytes. KDM1B is highly expressed in growing oocytes
where genomic imprints are established. Targeted disruption of the gene
encoding KDM1B had no effect on mouse development or oogenesis. However,
oocytes from KDM1B-deficient females showed a substantial increase in
H3K4 methylation and failed to set up the DNA methylation marks at 4 out
of 7 imprinted genes examined. Embryos derived from these oocytes showed
biallelic expression or biallelic suppression of the affected genes and
died before midgestation. Ciccone et al. (2009) concluded that
demethylation of H3K4 is critical for establishing the DNA methylation
imprints during oogenesis.

Nucleosomes are largely replaced by protamine in mature human sperm.
Hammoud et al. (2009) showed that the retained nucleosomes were
significantly enriched at loci of developmental importance, including
imprinted gene clusters, microRNA clusters, HOX gene clusters, and
promoters of stand-alone developmental transcription and signaling
factors. Histone modifications localized to particular developmental
loci. H3K4me2 was enriched at certain developmental promoters, whereas
large blocks of H3K4me3 localized to a subset of developmental
promoters, regions in HOX clusters, certain noncoding RNAs, and
generally to paternally expressed imprinted loci, but not paternally
repressed loci. H3K27me3 was significantly enriched at developmental
promoters that were repressed in early embryos, including many bivalent
promoters (i.e., bearing both H3K4me3 and H3K27me3) in embryonic stem
cells. Developmental promoters were generally DNA hypomethylated in
sperm, but they acquired methylation during differentiation. Hammoud et
al. (2009) concluded that epigenetic marking in sperm is extensive and
is correlated with developmental regulators.

Maze et al. (2010) identified an essential role for H3K9 dimethylation
and the lysine dimethyltransferase G9a (604599) in cocaine-induced
structural and behavioral plasticity in mouse. Repeated cocaine
administration reduced global levels of H3K9 dimethylation in the
nucleus accumbens. This reduction in histone methylation was mediated
through the repression of G9a in this brain region, which was regulated
by the cocaine-induced transcription factor delta-FosB (164772). Using
conditional mutagenesis and viral-mediated gene transfer, Maze et al.
(2010) found that G9a downregulation increased the dendritic spine
plasticity of nucleus accumbens neurons and enhanced the preference for
cocaine, thereby establishing a crucial role for histone methylation in
the long-term actions of cocaine.

Luco et al. (2010) demonstrated a direct role for histone modifications,
specifically, trimethylation of H3 at lys36 (H3-K36me3), in alternative
splicing. The authors found that MRG15 (607303) distribution along the
polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB; 600693)-dependent
alternatively spliced genes FGFR2 (176943), TPM2 (190990), TPM1
(191010), and PKM2 (179050), but not along the control gene CD44
(107269), mimicked H3-K36me3 distribution. Overexpression of MRG15 was
sufficient to force exclusion of the PTB-dependent exons but did not
significantly alter the inclusion levels of CD44 exon v6. Additional
experiments led Luco et al. (2010) to conclude that the
chromatin-binding protein MRG15 is a modulator of PTB-dependent
alternative splice site selection. The results of Luco et al. (2010) led
them to propose the existence of an adaptor system for the reading of
histone marks by the pre-mRNA splicing machinery. The adaptor system
consists of histone modifications, a chromatin-binding protein that
reads the histone marks, and an interacting splicing regulator. Luco et
al. (2010) concluded that for a subset of PTB-dependent genes, the
adaptor system consists of H3-K36me3, its binding protein MRG15, and the
splicing regulator PTBP1.

He et al. (2010) performed genomewide mapping of nucleosomes marked with
H3K4me2 in upstream AR-binding enhancers in LNCaP prostate cancer cells
before and following stimulation by dihydrotestosterone (DHT). They
found 3 nucleosomes containing H3K4me2 associated with AR-binding sites
in the absence of DHT, including 2 stable flanking nucleosomes
positioned about 200 bp apart, and a labile central nucleosome that
occluded the actual AR-binding site. Following stimulation, H3K4me2 was
detected only in the 2 flanking sites. The central occluding nucleosome
had a higher A/T content than the flanking nucleosomes, and its histone
octamer was more likely to contain the H2A.Z variant. He et al. (2010)
concluded that apparent differences in nucleosome stability may result
from the combination of DNA sequence, histone octamer composition, and
transcription factor binding.

The histone methylase SUV39H1 (300254) participates in the
trimethylation of histone H3 on lysine-9 (H3K9me3), a modification that
provides binding sites for heterochromatin protein 1-alpha (HP1-alpha;
604478) and promotes transcriptional silencing. This pathway was
initially associated with heterochromatin formation and maintenance but
can also contribute to the regulation of euchromatic genes. Allan et al.
(2012) proposed that the SUV39H1-H3K9me3-HP1-alpha pathway participates
in maintaining the silencing of TH1 loci, ensuring TH2 lineage
stability. In TH2 cells that are deficient in SUV39H1, the ratio between
trimethylated and acetylated H3K9 is impaired, and the binding of
HP1-alpha at the promoters of silenced TH1 genes is reduced. Despite
showing normal differentiation, both SUV39H1-deficient TH2 cells and
HP1-alpha-deficient TH2 cells, in contrast to wildtype cells, expressed
TH1 genes when recultured under conditions that drive differentiation
into TH1 cells. In a mouse model of TH2-driven allergic asthma, the
chemical inhibition or loss of SUV39H1 skewed T-cell responses towards
TH1 responses and decreased the lung pathology.

Yuan et al. (2012) reported that polycomb repressive complex-2 (PRC2)
activity is regulated by the density of its substrate nucleosome arrays.
Neighboring nucleosomes activate the PRC2 complex with a fragment of
their H3 histones (ala31 to arg42). Yuan et al. (2012) also identified
mutations on PRC2 subunit Suz12 (606245) that impair its binding and
response to the activating peptide and its ability in establishing H3K27
trimethylation levels in vivo. In mouse embryonic stem cells, local
chromatin compaction occurs before the formation of trimethylated H3K27
upon transcription cessation of the retinoic acid-regulated gene CYP26A1
(602239). Yuan et al. (2012) proposed that PRC2 can sense the chromatin
environment to exert its role in the maintenance of transcriptional
states.

- Phosphorylation and Dephosphorylation of H3 Histones

During the immediate-early response of mammalian cells to mitogens,
histone H3 is rapidly and transiently phosphorylated by 1 or more
kinases. Sassone-Corsi et al. (1999) demonstrated that RSK2 (300075), a
member of the pp90(RSK) family of kinases implicated in growth control,
was required for epidermal growth factor (EGF; 131530)-stimulated
phosphorylation of H3. H3 appears to be a direct or indirect target of
RSK2, suggesting to Sassone-Corsi et al. (1999) that chromatin
remodeling might contribute to mitogen-activated protein
kinase-regulated gene expression.

Anest et al. (2003) demonstrated nuclear accumulation of IKK-alpha
(IKKA; 600664) after cytokine exposure, suggesting a nuclear function
for this protein. Consistent with this, chromatin immunoprecipitation
assays revealed that IKKA was recruited to the promoter regions of
NF-kappa-B (164011)-regulated genes on stimulation with tumor necrosis
factor-alpha (191160). Notably, NF-kappa-B-regulated gene expression was
suppressed by the loss of IKKA, and this correlated with a complete loss
of gene-specific phosphorylation of histone H3 on serine-10, a
modification previously associated with positive gene expression.
Furthermore, Anest et al. (2003) showed that IKKA can directly
phosphorylate histone H3 in vitro, suggesting a new substrate for this
kinase. Anest et al. (2003) proposed that IKKA is an essential regulator
of NFKB-dependent gene expression through control of promoter-associated
histone phosphorylation after cytokine exposure.

Yamamoto et al. (2003) independently demonstrated that IKKA functions in
the nucleus to activate the expression of NF-kappa-B-responsive genes
after stimulation with cytokines. IKKA interactions with CREB-binding
protein (600140) and in conjunction with RELA (164014) is recruited to
NF-kappa-B-responsive promoters and mediates the cytokine-induced
phosphorylation and subsequent acetylation of specific residues in
histone H3. Yamamoto et al. (2003) concluded that their results define a
new nuclear role of IKKA in modifying histone function that is critical
for the activation of NF-kappa-B-directed gene expression.

Fischle et al. (2005) demonstrated that HP1-alpha (604478), HP1-beta
(604511), and HP1-gamma (604477) are released from chromatin during the
M phase of the cell cycle, even though trimethylation levels of H3K9
remain unchanged. However, the additional transient modification of
histone H3 by phosphorylation of ser10 next to the more stable
methyl-lys9 mark is sufficient to eject HP1 proteins from their binding
sites. Inhibition or depletion of the mitotic kinase Aurora B (604970),
which phosphorylates histone H3 on ser10, causes retention of HP1
proteins on mitotic chromosomes, suggesting that H3 ser10
phosphorylation is necessary for the dissociation of HP1 from chromatin
in M phase. Fischle et al. (2005) concluded that their findings
establish a regulatory mechanism of protein-protein interactions,
through a combinatorial readout of 2 adjacent posttranslational
modifications: a stable methylation and a dynamic phosphorylation mark.

Dawson et al. (2009) showed that human JAK2 (147796) is present in the
nucleus of hematopoietic cells and directly phosphorylates tyr41 (Y41)
on histone H3. Heterochromatin protein 1-alpha (HP1-alpha, 604478), but
not HP1-beta (604511), specifically binds to this region of H3 through
its chromo-shadow domain. Phosphorylation of H3Y41 by JAK2 prevents this
binding. Inhibition of JAK2 activity in human leukemic cells decreases
both the expression of hematopoietic oncogene LMO2 (180385) and the
phosphorylation of H3Y41 at its promoter, while simultaneously
increasing the binding of HP1-alpha at the same site. Dawson et al.
(2009) concluded that their results identified a previously unrecognized
nuclear role for JAK2 in the phosphorylation of H3Y41 and revealed a
direct mechanistic link between 2 genes, JAK2 and LMO2, involved in
normal hematopoiesis and leukemia.

Metzger et al. (2010) demonstrated that phosphorylation of histone H3 at
threonine-6 (H3T6) by protein kinase C (PKC)-beta-1 (176970) is the key
event that prevents LSD1 (609132) from demethylating H3K4 during
androgen receptor (AR; 313700)-dependent gene activation. In vitro,
histone H3 peptides methylated at lysine-4 and phosphorylated at
threonine-6 were no longer LSD1 substrates. In vivo, PKC-beta-1
colocalized with AR and LSD1 on target gene promoters and phosphorylated
H3T6 after androgen-induced gene expression. RNAi-mediated knockdown of
PKC-beta-1 abrogated H3T6 phosphorylation, enhanced demethylation at
H3K4, and inhibited AR-dependent transcription. Activation of PKCB1
requires androgen-dependent recruitment of the gatekeeper kinase protein
kinase C-related kinase 1 (PRK1; 601032). Notably, increased levels of
PKCB1 and phosphorylated H3T6 (H3T6ph) positively correlated with high
Gleason scores of prostate carcinomas, and inhibition of PKC-beta-1
blocked AR-induced tumor cell proliferation in vitro and cancer
progression of tumor xenografts in vivo. Together, Metzger et al. (2010)
concluded that androgen-dependent kinase signaling leads to the writing
of the new chromatin mark H3T6ph, which in consequence prevents removal
of active methyl marks from H3K4 during AR-stimulated gene expression.

Wang et al. (2010) showed that phosphorylation of histone H3 threonine-3
(H3T3) by haspin (609240) is necessary for chromosomal passenger complex
(CPC) accumulation at centromeres and that the CPC subunit survivin
(603352) binds directly to phosphorylated H3T3 (H3T3ph). A nonbinding
survivin-D70A/D71A mutant did not support centromeric CPC concentration,
and both haspin depletion and survivin-D70A/D71A mutation diminished
centromere localization of the kinesin MCAK (604538) and the mitotic
checkpoint response to taxol. Survivin-D70A/D71A mutation and
microinjection of H3T3ph-specific antibody both compromised centromeric
Aurora B (604970) functions but did not prevent cytokinesis. Therefore,
Wang et al. (2010) concluded that H3T3ph generated by haspin positions
the chromosomal passenger complex at centromeres to regulate selected
targets of Aurora B during mitosis.

Kelly et al. (2010) demonstrated that H3T3ph is directly recognized by
an evolutionarily conserved binding pocket in the BIR domain of the CPC
subunit survivin. This binding mediates recruitment of the CPC to
chromosomes and the resulting activation of its kinase subunit Aurora B.
Consistently, modulation of the kinase activity of haspin, which
phosphorylates H3T3, leads to defects in the Aurora B-dependent
processes of spindle assembly and inhibition of nuclear reformation.
Kelly et al. (2010) concluded that their findings established a direct
cellular role for mitotic H3T3 phosphorylation, which is read and
translated by the CPC to ensure accurate cell division.

Yamagishi et al. (2010) showed that phosphorylation of H3T3 mediated by
haspin cooperates with bub1 (602452)-mediated histone 2A-serine-121
(H2A-S121) phosphorylation in targeting the CPC to the inner centromere
in fission yeast and human cells. Phosphorylated H3T3 promotes
nucleosome binding of survivin, whereas phosphorylated H2A-S121
facilitates the binding of shugoshin (609168), the centromeric CPC
adaptor. Haspin colocalizes with cohesin by associating with Pds5 (see
613200), whereas bub1 localizes at kinetochores. Thus, Yamagishi et al.
(2010) concluded that the inner centromere is defined by intersection of
2 histone kinases.

Healy et al. (2012) reviewed the role of phosphorylation of H3 at ser10
and ser28 by MSK1 (RPS6KA5; 603607)/MSK2 (RPS6KA4; 603606) in the
regulation of immediate-early genes, such as JUN (165160) and FOS
(164810).

- Acetylation and Deacetylation of H3 Histones

Agalioti et al. (2002) found that only a small subset of lysines in
histones H3 and H4 are acetylated in vivo by the GCN5 acetyltransferase
(see 602301) during activation of the interferon-beta gene (IFNB;
147640). Reconstitution of recombinant nucleosomes bearing mutations in
these lysine residues revealed the cascade of gene activation via a
point-by-point interpretation of the histone code through the ordered
recruitment of bromodomain-containing transcription complexes.
Acetylation of histone H4 lys8 mediates recruitment of the SWI/SNF
complex (see 603111), whereas acetylation of lys9 and lys14 in histone
H3 is critical for the recruitment of TFIID (see 313650). Thus, the
information contained in the DNA address of the enhancer is transferred
to the histone N termini by generating novel adhesive surfaces required
for the recruitment of transcription complexes.

Masumoto et al. (2005) showed that acetylation of the lysine at position
56 (K56) in histone H3 is an abundant modification of newly synthesized
histone H3 molecules that are incorporated into chromosomes during S
phase. Defects in the acetylation of K56 in histone H3 result in
sensitivity to genotoxic agents that cause DNA strand breaks during
replication. In the absence of DNA damage, the acetylation of K56
largely disappears in G2. In contrast, cells with DNA breaks maintain
high levels of acetylation, and the persistence of the modification is
dependent on DNA damage checkpoint proteins. Masumoto et al. (2005)
suggested that the acetylation of histone H3 K56 in S. cerevisiae
creates a favorable chromatin environment for DNA repair and that a key
component of the DNA damage response is to preserve this acetylation.

Michishita et al. (2008) showed that the human SIRT6 protein (606211) is
an NAD(+)-dependent histone H3K9 deacetylase that modulates telomeric
chromatin. They showed that SIRT6 associates specifically with
telomeres, and SIRT6 depletion led to telomere dysfunction with
end-to-end chromosomal fusions and premature cellular senescence.
Moreover, SIRT6-depleted cells exhibited abnormal telomere structures
that resemble defects observed in Werner syndrome (277700), a premature
aging disorder. At telomeric chromatin, SIRT6 deacetylated H3K9 and was
required for the stable association of RECQL2 (604611), the factor that
is mutated in Werner syndrome. Michishita et al. (2008) proposed that
SIRT6 contributes to the propagation of a specialized chromatin state at
mammalian telomeres, which in turn is required for proper telomere
metabolism and function. The authors concluded that their findings
constituted the first identification of a physiologic enzymatic activity
of SIRT6, and linked chromatin regulation by SIRT6 to telomere
maintenance and to a human premature aging syndrome.

Das et al. (2009) demonstrated that the histone acetyltransferase CBP
(600140) in flies, and CBP and p300 (602700) in humans, acetylate H3K56,
whereas Drosophila sir2 and human SIRT1 (604479) and SIRT2 (604480)
deacetylate H3K56 acetylation. The histone chaperones ASF1A (609189) in
humans and Asf1 in Drosophila are required for acetylation of H3K56 in
vivo, whereas the histone chaperone CAF1 (see 601245) in humans and Caf1
in Drosophila are required for the incorporation of histones bearing
this mark into chromatin. Das et al. (2009) showed that, in response to
DNA damage, histones bearing acetylated K56 are assembled into chromatin
in Drosophila and human cells, forming foci that colocalize with sites
of DNA repair. Furthermore, acetylation of H3K56 is increased in
multiple types of cancer, correlating with increased levels of ASF1A in
these tumors. Das et al. (2009) concluded that their identification of
multiple proteins regulating the levels of H3K56 acetylation in
metazoans will allow future studies of this critical and unique histone
modification that couples chromatin assembly to DNA synthesis, cell
proliferation, and cancer.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Zaidi et al. (2013) compared the incidence of de novo mutations in 362
severe congenital heart disease cases and 264 controls by analyzing
exome sequencing of parent-offspring trios. Congenital heart disease
cases showed a significant excess of protein-altering de novo mutations
in genes expressed in the developing heart, with an odds ratio of 7.5
for damaging (premature termination, frameshift, splice site) mutations.
Similar odds ratios were seen across the main classes of severe
congenital heart disease. Zaidi et al. (2013) found a marked excess of
de novo mutations in genes involved in the production, removal, or
reading of histone 3 lysine-4 (H3K4) methylation or ubiquitination of
H2BK120 (see 609904), which is required for H3K4 methylation. There were
also 2 de novo mutations in SMAD2 (601366), which regulates H3K27
methylation in the embryonic left right organizer. The combination of
both activating (H3K4 methylation) and inactivating (H3K27 methylation)
chromatin marks characterizes 'poised' promoters and enhancers, which
regulate expression of key developmental genes.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

As revealed by the structure of the chromodomain of HP1 (see 604511)
bound to a histone H3 peptide dimethylated at N-zeta of lys9, Nielsen et
al. (2002) showed that HP1 uses an induced-fit mechanism to recognize
the methylation of lys9. The side chain of lys9 is almost fully extended
and surrounded by residues that are conserved in many other
chromodomains. The QTAR peptide sequence preceding lys9 performs most of
the additional interactions with the chromodomain, with HP1 residues
val23, leu40, trp42, leu58, and cys60 appearing to be a major
determinant of specificity by binding the key buried ala7. Nielsen et
al. (2002) concluded that their findings predict which other
chromodomains will bind methylated proteins and suggest a motif that
they might recognize.

Using deuterium exchange/mass spectrometry coupled with hydrodynamic
measures, Black et al. (2004) demonstrated that CENPA (117139) and
histone H4 form subnucleosomal tetramers that are more compact and
conformationally more rigid than the corresponding tetramers of histones
H3 and H4. Substitution into histone H3 of the domain of CENPA
responsible for compaction was sufficient to direct it to centromeres.
Thus, Black et al. (2004) concluded that the centromere-targeting domain
of CENPA confers a unique structural rigidity to the nucleosomes into
which it assembles, and is likely to have a role in maintaining
centromere identity.

NOMENCLATURE

Marzluff et al. (2002) provided a nomenclature for replication-dependent
histone genes located within the HIST1, HIST2, and HIST3 clusters. The
symbols for these genes all begin with HIST1, HIST2, or HIST3 according
to which cluster they are located in. The H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 genes
were named systematically according to their location within the HIST1,
HIST2, and HIST3 clusters. For example, HIST1H3A is the most telomeric
H3 gene within HIST1, and HIST1H3J (602817) is the most centromeric. In
contrast, the H1 genes, all of which are located within HIST1, were
named according to their mouse homologs. Thus, HIST1H1A (142709) is
homologous to mouse H1a, HIST1H1B (142711) is homologous to mouse H1b,
and so on.

603307	TITLE *603307 BEADED FILAMENT STRUCTURAL PROTEIN 1; BFSP1
;;CYTOSKELETAL PROTEIN, 115-KD; CP115;;
FILENSIN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The beaded filament is a cytoskeletal structure, which is abundant in
the fiber cells of the ocular lens. BFSP1 and BFSP2 (603212) are major
components of the beaded filament (Hess et al., 1995).

CLONING

By PCR of human lens cDNA using primers based on sequences conserved
between rat and bovine filensin, Hess et al. (1995) isolated a partial
cDNA encoding human filensin, which they called CP115. Northern blot
analysis indicated that filensin was expressed as a 2.4-kb mRNA only in
human lens. Hess et al. (1998) reported the sequence of a cDNA
corresponding to the entire human filensin coding region. The sequence
of the predicted 665-amino acid human protein is 62% and 50% identical
to those of bovine and chicken filensin, respectively. However, it has
less than 26% identity to other members of the intermediate filament
(IF) family (see 148070). Sequence analysis revealed that, like other IF
proteins, filensin contains a central rod domain flanked by an
N-terminal head domain and C-terminal tail domain, although the filensin
central rod domain is uniquely short. Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis,
Hess et al. (1998) demonstrated that filensin formed heterodimers with
BFSP2 but not with any other IF protein tested.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hess et al. (1998) determined that the BFSP1 gene contains 7 introns and
spans approximately 35 kb. The number (6) and positions of the introns
in the region encoding the central rod domain generally correspond to
those of type III IF genes.

MAPPING

By analysis of somatic cell hybrids, Hess et al. (1995) mapped the
filensin gene to chromosome 20. Using fluorescence in situ
hybridization, radiation hybrid mapping, and analysis of YAC clones,
Rendtorff et al. (1998) refined the map position to 20p12.1-p11.23.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Ramachandran et al. (2007) sequenced the BFSP1 gene in 11 affected and 8
unaffected members of a large consanguineous Indian family with
juvenile-onset cortical cataract mapping to chromosome 20p (CTRCT33;
611391) and identified homozygosity for a 3,343-bp deletion encompassing
exon 6 (603307.0001) in all affected individuals.

BFSP1, 3.3-KB DEL, NT736

In 11 affected members of a large consanguineous Indian family with
juvenile-onset cortical cataract (CTRCT33; 611391), Ramachandran et al.
(2007) identified homozygosity for a 3,343-bp deletion encompassing exon
6 of the BFSP1 gene, predicted to result in 6 additional residues due to
a frameshift, followed by a premature stop codon resulting in loss of
the final 414 amino acids of the protein. Unaffected carriers were
heterozygous for the change, which was not found in 100 ethnically
matched chromosomes.

601627	TITLE *601627 SURVIVAL OF MOTOR NEURON 2; SMN2
;;SURVIVAL OF MOTOR NEURON, CENTROMERIC COPY; SMNC;;
C-BCD541
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The SMN1 (600354) and SMN2 genes lie within the telomeric and
centromeric halves, respectively, of a large, inverted duplication on
chromosome 5q13. These genes share more than 99% nucleotide identity,
and both are capable of encoding a 294-amino acid RNA-binding protein,
SMN, that is required for efficient assembly of small nuclear
ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complexes. Homozygous loss of the SMN1 gene
causes spinal muscular atrophy (SMA; 253300). Absence of SMN1 is
partially compensated for by SMN2, which produces enough SMN protein to
allow for relatively normal development in cell types other than motor
neurons. However, SMN2 cannot fully compensate for loss of SMN1 because,
although SMN2 is transcribed at a level comparable to that of SMN1, a
large majority of SMN2 transcripts lack exon 7, resulting in production
of a truncated, less stable SMN protein (Lefebvre et al., 1995; Kashima
et al., 2007).

CLONING

Lefebvre et al. (1995) described an inverted duplication of a 500-kb
element in normal chromosome 5q13, which contains the gene for spinal
muscular atrophy. Within the telomeric region, they identified the SMN1
gene. A highly homologous gene, referred to as C-BCD541 and also known
as SMNC or SMN2, was present in the duplicated centromeric element in
95% of controls. PCR amplification and sequence analysis revealed 5
nucleotide discrepancies between the centromeric and telomeric SMN
genes, 2 of which occur in exons 7 and 8. The centromeric SMN gene
undergoes alternative splicing of exon 7, resulting in a truncated mRNA
transcript lacking exon 7 and a putative protein with a different
C-terminal end.

Using a panel of anti-SMN antibodies, Coovert et al. (1997) demonstrated
that the SMN protein is expressed from both the SMN1 and SMN2 genes.

GENE STRUCTURE

Burglen et al. (1996) determined that the SMN gene has 9 exons and spans
approximately 20 kb. Burglen et al. (1996) referred to exon 2 as exons
2a and 2b.

Boda et al. (2004) determined that the first 4.6 kb of the SMN1 and SMN2
promoters are identical. The promoters contain 12 SP1 (189906), 8 AP1
(see 165160), 3 AP2 (107580), 6 HNF3 (see 602294), 24 Zeste (see
601674), and 4 RXR-beta (180246) sites. There are no RE1 elements. Boda
et al. (2004) transfected primary cultures of mouse embryonic spinal
cord and fibroblasts with constructs containing 1.8, 3.2, or 4.6 kb of
the promoter region fused to a reporter gene. Expression of the 1.8- and
3.2-kb constructs was stronger in spinal cord than in fibroblast
cultures; the 4.6-kb construct gave 5-fold higher expression in neurons
than in fibroblasts, with expression in fibroblasts lower than that
achieved with the 3.2-kb construct. Boda et al. (2004) concluded that
these results suggest the presence of an enhancer element between 1.8
and 3.2 kb upstream from the transcriptional start site of the SMN genes
that functions in both culture types, and a silencer between 3.2 and 4.6
kb that is active only in fibroblast cultures.

MAPPING

Lefebvre et al. (1995) determined that the SMN2 gene lies within the
centromeric half of a large inverted duplication on chromosome 5q13. The
SMN1 gene lies in the telomeric half of the duplication.

GENE FUNCTION

Monani et al. (1999) sequenced 3 genomic clones over 32 kb in length,
which spanned both the SMN1 and SMN2 genes. Of 35 sequence differences
noted between SMN1 and SMN2, only 3 were located in either exon 7 or
intron 7. Of note was a translationally silent 840C-T transition at
position +6 in exon 7, which affects splicing. Using minigene
constructs, the authors found that the presence of cytosine at position
+6 in exon 7 produced a normal splicing pattern retaining exon 7,
whereas thymine in this position resulted in the absence of exon 7 in
the majority of the transcripts. Since the majority of human SMN2
transcripts lack exon 7, the authors hypothesized that the 5-prime
portion of exon 7 in SMN1 contains an exonic splice enhancer (ESE), and
that low levels of full-length SMN transcript are responsible for the
SMA phenotype.

Andreassi et al. (2001) screened a library of compounds and found that
aclarubicin increased the retention of exon 7 into the SMN2 transcript
from the endogenous gene in type I SMA fibroblasts, as well as from an
SMN2 minigene in a motor neuron cell line. In type I fibroblasts,
treatment resulted in an increase in SMN protein and gems to normal
levels. The authors demonstrated the utility of high-throughput screens
in detecting compounds that affect the splicing pattern of a gene, and
suggested that alteration of splicing patterns may represent a feasible
approach to modification of gene expression in disease treatment.

Using in vivo splicing assays, Hofmann and Wirth (2002) identified the
protein hnRNPG (300199) and its paralog RBM (400006) as 2 novel splicing
factors that promote the inclusion of SMN2 exon 7. Both hnRNPG and RBM
nonspecifically bind RNA, but directly and specifically bind
Htra2-beta1, an SR-like splicing factor which stimulates inclusion of
exon 7 through a direct interaction with SMN2 exon 7 pre-mRNA. Using
deletion mutants of hnRNPG, the authors demonstrated a specific
protein-protein interaction of hnRNPG with Htra2-beta1 which mediates
the inclusion of SMN2 exon 7 rather than the nonspecific interaction of
hnRNPG with SMN pre-mRNA. These trans-acting splicing factors were also
effective on endogenous SMN2 transcripts and increased the endogenous
SMN protein level. The authors presented a model of how exon 7 mRNA
processing may be regulated by these splicing factors.

Kashima and Manley (2003) showed that the exonic splicing silencer in
SMN2 functions as a binding site for a known repressor protein, HNRNPA1
(164017), which binds to SMN2 but not SMN1 exon 7 RNA. By using small
interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to reduce HNRNPA1 protein levels in living
cells, Kashima and Manley (2003) demonstrated efficient SMN2 exon 7
splicing. The findings not only defined a new mechanism underlying the
inefficient splicing of SMN2 exon 7 but also illustrated more generally
the remarkable sensitivity and precision that characterizes control of
mRNA splicing. The work also made it possible to consider therapeutic
approaches to spinal muscular atrophy that involved decreasing HNRNPA1
RNA binding to or function on SMN2 exon 7.

Helmken et al. (2003) stated that sibs with identical 5q13 homologs and
homozygous absence of SMN1 can have variable phenotypes, suggesting that
the spinal muscular atrophy phenotype is modified by other factors,
which function either on the transcriptional level, to produce more
full-length SMN (FL-SMN) transcripts, or on the translational level, to
increase the amount of SMN2 protein. By analyzing 9 SMA discordant
families, Helmken et al. (2003) demonstrated that in all families
unaffected sibs produced significantly higher amounts of SMN,
SMN-interacting protein-1 (SIP1; 602595), GEMIN3 (606168), ZPR1
(603901), and hnRNPQ protein in lymphoblastoid cell lines, but not in
primary fibroblasts, compared with their affected sibs. The results
suggested that the modifying factor or factors act on the SMN gene to
influence SMN protein levels, thus modifying the SMA phenotype, and not
through an independent pathway. In addition, the observed coregulations
appeared to be tissue-specific. SMN significantly coregulated its
interacting partners, including its own splicing factor, HTRA2-beta-1
(see 606441), due to an indirect feedback mechanism. Thus, Helmken et
al. (2003) showed that reduction of the SMN protein has a significant
impact on the expression level of a splicing factor.

Brichta et al. (2003) showed that in fibroblast cultures derived from
SMA patients treated with therapeutic doses of valproic acid, the level
of full-length SMN2 mRNA/protein increased 2- to 4-fold. This
upregulation of SMN was most likely attributable to increased levels of
HTRA2-beta-1 as well as to SMN gene transcription activation. Valproic
acid also increased SMN protein levels through transcription activation
in organotypic hippocampal rat brain slices. Additionally, valproic acid
increased the expression of other serine-arginine family proteins, which
may have important implications for other disorders affected by
alternative splicing.

Grzeschik et al. (2005) reported that cultured lymphocytes from patients
with SMA showed increased production of the full-length SMN mRNA and
protein in response to treatment with hydroxyurea. The findings
suggested that hydroxyurea promoted inclusion of exon 7 during SMN2
transcription.

Kernochan et al. (2005) investigated the levels of acetylated H3 and H4
histones and histone deacetylases (HDACs) associated with different
regions of the human and mouse SMN genes in both cultured cells and
tissues. The SMN gene had a reproducible pattern of histone acetylation
that was largely conserved among different tissues and species. A
limited region of the promoter surrounding the transcriptional start
site had relatively high levels of histone acetylation. After HDAC
inhibitor treatment, acetylated histone levels increased, particularly
at upstream regions, correlating with a 2-fold increase in promoter
activity. During development in mouse tissues, histone acetylation
levels decreased and associated HDAC2 (605164) levels increased at the
region closest to the transcriptional start site, correlating with a 40
to 60% decrease in SMN transcript and protein levels. Kernochan et al.
(2005) suggested that histone acetylation may modulate SMN gene
expression.

Skipping of SMN2 exon 7 had been attributed to either the loss of an
SF2/ASF-dependent exonic splicing enhancer or the creation of an hnRNP
A/B-dependent exonic splicing silencer, as a result of the C-to-T
transition. Cartegni et al. (2006) reported the extensive testing of the
enhancer-loss and silencer-gain models by mutagenesis, RNA interference,
overexpression, RNA splicing, and RNA-protein interaction experiments.
The results supported the enhancer-loss model but also demonstrated that
hnRNP A/B proteins antagonize SF2/ASF-dependent ESE activity and promote
exon 7 skipping by a mechanism that is independent of the C-to-T
transition and is, therefore, common to both SMN1 and SMN2. The findings
explained the basis of defective SMN2 splicing, illustrated the fine
balance between positive and negative determinants of exon identity and
alternative splicing, and underscored the importance of antagonistic
splicing factors and exonic elements in a disease context.

Kashima et al. (2007) showed that the 840C-T transition in SMN2 created
a high-affinity HNRNPA1-binding site. Depletion of HNRNPA1 in HeLa cells
restored exon 7 inclusion, indicating that splicing of exon 7 in SMN2 is
repressed by an HNRNPA1-dependent exonic splicing silencer.

Kashima et al. (2007) identified a novel single nucleotide difference
between SMN1 and SMN2, an A-to-G change at position +100 within intron 7
of SMN2, which creates a second high-affinity HNRNPA1-binding site
specific to SMN2. Base substitutions that disrupted this site in SMN2
restored exon 7 inclusion in vivo and prevented HNRNPA1 binding in
vitro. Kashima et al. (2007) proposed that interactions between HNRNPA1
molecules bound to the exonic and intronic sites cooperate to exclude
exon 7 in SMN2.

Angelozzi et al. (2008) found that salbutamol increased full-length SMN2
mRNA transcript levels in fibroblasts derived from patients with SMA.
The maximum increase (over 200%) was observed after 30 to 60 minutes.
This rapid rise correlated with decreased levels of SMN2 mRNA with
deletion of exon 7. Salbutamol treatment also resulted in increased SMN
protein levels and nuclear gems.

Using SMN minigenes, Gladman and Chandler (2009) identified 2 elements
within intron 7 of the SMN genes that influenced exon 7 splicing in a
cell type-independent manner.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Spinal Muscular Atrophy

Hahnen et al. (1996) reported molecular analysis of 42 SMA patients who
carried homozygous deletions of exon 7 but not of exon 8 in the
telomeric copy of the SMN gene (SMN1). Additional homozygous deletions
of exon 8 in the centromeric copy of SMN (SMN2) were found in 2 of the
patients. By a simple PCR test, they demonstrated the existence of
hybrid SMN genes, i.e., genes composed of both the centromeric SMN2 and
the telomeric SMN1. They reported a high frequency of hybrid SMN genes
in SMA patients with Czech or Polish background. Hahnen et al. (1996)
identified a single haplotype for half of the hybrid genes analyzed,
suggesting that in these cases the SMA chromosomes shared a common
origin.

Schwartz et al. (1997) used solid-phase minisequencing to determine the
ratio between the number of telomeric and centromeric copies of the SMN
gene in affected and unaffected members of 30 SMA families. Six
predominant haplotypes were identified, 3 for normal chromosomes and 3
for SMA chromosomes, characterized by having 0, 1, or 2 copies,
respectively, of SMN2. They found patients homozygous for a deletion of
SMN1 and with only one copy of SMN2, but found none deleted for all
copies of SMN2. Several asymptomatic carriers of SMA with only a single
copy of SMN1 and no copy of SMN2 were identified. Schwartz et al. (1997)
could not confirm the hypothesis that the presence of more copies of
SMN2 is correlated with a less severe course of the disease. The
frequencies of haplotypes characterized by having 0, 1, or 2 copies,
respectively, of SMN2 were found to differ significantly between normal
and SMA chromosomes. This distribution could be explained by an
underrepresentation of the haplotype completely lacking SMN genes, which
is expected to cause early embryonic death in homozygotes.

Srivastava et al. (2001) reported a 5-year-old boy with childhood-onset
SMA who had a homozygous deletion of SMN2. He had wasting, weakness, and
hyporeflexia, predominantly in the distal muscles. The affected muscles
showed chronic neurogenic changes on electromyography. There was no
sensory involvement. A nerve conduction study showed near-normal
conduction velocity with reduction in the amplitude of the compound
muscle action potential. The SMN2 deletion was demonstrated by studies
of exons 7 and 8 of the SMN genes. Base sequencing and densitometric
analysis of the critical exon 7 region did not show any microdeletion or
duplication of SMN1, but confirmed the deletion of SMN2. Srivastava et
al. (2001) concluded that deletion of SMN2 can also result in the SMA
phenotype.

Feldkotter et al. (2002) developed a quantitative test for either SMN1
or SMN2 to analyze SMA patients for their SMN2 copy number and to
correlate the SMN2 copy number with type of SMA and duration of
survival. The quantitative analysis of SMN2 copies in 375 patients with
type I, type II, or type III SMA showed a significant correlation
between SMN2 copy number and type of SMA as well as duration of
survival. Thus, 80% of patients with type I SMA carried 1 or 2 SMN2
copies and 82% of patients with type II SMA carried 3 SMN2 copies,
whereas 96% of patients with type III SMA carried 3 or 4 SMN2 copies.
Among 113 patients with type I SMA, 9 with 1 SMN2 copy lived less than
11 months, 88 of 94 with 2 SMN2 copies lived less than 21 months, and 8
of 10 with 3 SMN2 copies lived 33 to 66 months. On the basis of SMN2
copy number, Feldkotter et al. (2002) calculated the posterior
probability that a child with homozygous absence of SMN1 will develop
type I, type II, or type III SMA.

Ogino et al. (2004) analyzed all 'available and reliable' data to
calculate allele/haplotype frequencies and new mutation rates in the SMN
region. The authors stated that their data provided the basis for the
most accurate genetic risk calculations as well as evidence that
nucleotide position 840 constitutes a mutation hotspot. Ogino et al.
(2004) suggested that there is selection of the single-copy SMN1-SMN2
haplotype and that rare chromosomes with 3 copies of SMN1 exist.

Wirth et al. (2006) analyzed SMN2 copy number in 115 patients with SMA3
(253400) or SMA4 (271150) who had confirmed homozygous absence of SMN1
and found that 62% of SMA3 patients with age of onset less than 3 years
had 2 or 3 SMN2 copies, whereas 65% of SMA3 patients with age of onset
greater than 3 years had 4 to 5 SMN2 copies. Of the 4 adult-onset (SMA4)
patients, 3 had 4 SMN2 copies and 1 had 6 copies. Wirth et al. (2006)
concluded that SMN2 may have a disease-modifying role in SMA, with a
greater SMN2 copy number associated with later onset and better
prognosis.

Hauke et al. (2009) demonstrated that SMN2 is subject to gene silencing
by DNA methylation. SMN2 contains 4 CpG islands which present highly
conserved methylation patterns and little interindividual variation in
SMN1-deleted SMA patients. The comprehensive analysis of SMN2
methylation in patients suffering from severe versus mild SMA carrying
identical SMN2 copy numbers revealed a correlation of CpG methylation at
the positions -290 and -296 with disease severity and the activity of
the first transcriptional start site of SMN2 at position -296. The
methyl-CpG-binding protein-2 (MECP2; 300005), a transcriptional
repressor, bound to the critical SMN2 promoter region in a
methylation-dependent manner. The authors identified histone deacetylase
(HDAC) inhibitors (including vorinostat and romidepsin) that were able
to bypass SMN2 gene silencing by DNA methylation, while others (such as
valproic acid and phenylbutyrate) did not, due to HDAC isoenzyme
specificities. The authors concluded that DNA methylation is
functionally important regarding SMA disease progression, and
pharmacologic SMN2 gene activation might have implications for future
SMA therapy regimens.

- Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis

Moulard et. al. (1998) found homozygous deletions of SMN2 in 36% of
individuals with sporadic adult-onset lower motor neuron disease (LMND),
but in only 6.2% of individuals with sporadic amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis (ALS; 105400) and 1.5% of individuals with familial ALS. The
authors argued that SMN2, but not SMN1, deletions are a susceptibility
factor for LMND, a disorder distinguishable from ALS by the absence of
upper motor neuron signs. LMND patients with SMN2 deletions differed
from those patients without such deletions by earlier age of onset (40
vs 56 years), more rapid disease progression (25 vs 36 months to death),
and a lower preponderance of males (M:F ratio of 1.5 vs 2.5).

Among 124 ALS patients, Gamez et al. (2002) found no association between
homozygous deletion of SMN2 and disease onset, respiratory decline, or
survival. A homozygous SMN2 deletion was identified in 11 (8.8%)
patients and 20 (10%) of 200 control individuals. Corcia et al. (2002)
found no difference in SMN2 gene copies among 167 ALS patients and 167
controls. Homozygous deletion of the SMN2 gene was found in 9 and 10% of
patients and controls, respectively. Among 600 patients with sporadic
ALS, Corcia et al. (2006) found no disease association with SMN2 copy
number.

Crawford and Skolasky (2002) briefly reviewed several reported
associations of SMN to ALS and concluded that the findings likely
represented nonsignificant or borderline significant fluctuations.
Corcia et al. (2002) responded that although they still supported a role
for the SMN2 gene in LMND (Moulard et al., 1998), the evidence of an
association between homozygous SMN2 deletion and ALS was less
convincing.

EVOLUTION

Rochette et al. (2001) used a number of approaches to probe the
evolutionary history of the SMN1 and SMN2 genes and showed that SMN gene
duplication and the appearance of SMN2 occurred at very distinct
evolutionary times. Molecular fossil and molecular clock data suggested
that this duplication may have occurred as recently as 3 million years
ago in that the position and repetitive elements are identical for both
human SMN genes and overall sequence divergence ranges from 0.15 to
0.34%. However, these approaches ignored the possibility of sequence
homogenization by means of gene conversion. Consequently, Rochette et
al. (2001) used quantitative polymerase chain reaction and analysis of
allelic variants to provide physical evidence for or against SMN gene
duplication in the chimpanzee, mankind's closest relative. These studies
revealed that chimpanzees have 2 to 7 copies of the SMN gene per diploid
genome; however, the 2 nucleotides diagnostic for exons 7-8 and the
SMNdel7 mRNA product of the SMN2 gene are absent in nonhuman primates.
In contrast, the SMN2 gene has been detected in all extant human
populations studied to date, including representatives from Europe, the
Central African Republic, and the Congo. These data provided conclusive
evidence that SMN gene duplication occurred more than 5 million years
ago, before the separation of human and chimpanzee lineages, but that
SMN2 appeared for the first time in Homo sapiens.

ANIMAL MODEL

Le et al. (2005) created transgenic mice expressing SMN2 lacking exon 7
(SMN-delta-7) and crossed them onto a severe SMA background. Expression
of SMN-delta-7 appeared to extend survival of SMA mice from 5 to 13
days. Unlike mice with selective deletion of SMN exon 7 in muscle, mice
with a small amount of full-length SMN (FL-SMN) did not show a
dystrophic phenotype. The authors suggested that low levels of FL-SMN
(as found in SMA patients) and absence of FL-SMN in muscle tissue may
have different effects, and raised the question of the importance of
high SMN levels in muscle in the presentation of SMA. SMN and
SMN-delta-7 can associate with each other; Le et al. (2005) suggested
that this association may stabilize SMN-delta-7 protein turnover and
ameliorate the SMA phenotype by increasing the amount of oligomeric SMN.

In SMA-like mouse embryonic fibroblasts and human SMN2-transfected motor
neuron cells, Ting et al. (2007) found that sodium vanadate,
trichostatin A, and aclarubicin effectively enhanced SMN2 expression by
inducing Stat5 (601511) activation. This resulted in enhanced SMN2
promoter activity with an increase in both full-length and deletion exon
7 SMN transcripts in human cells with SMN2. Knockdown of Stat5
expression disrupted the effects of sodium vanadate on SMN2 activation,
but did not influence SMN2 splicing, suggesting that Stat5 signaling is
involved in SMN2 transcriptional regulation. Constitutive expression of
the activated Stat5 mutant Stat5A1*6 profoundly increased the number of
nuclear gems in SMA patient lymphocytes and reduced SMA-like motor
neuron axon outgrowth defects.

Workman et al. (2009) showed that SMN(A111G), an allele capable of snRNP
assembly (A111G; 600354.0015), can rescue mice that lacked Smn and
contained either 1 or 2 copies of SMN2 (SMA mice). The correction of SMA
in these animals was directly correlated with snRNP assembly activity in
spinal cord, as was correction of snRNA levels. These data support snRNP
assembly as being the critical function affected in SMA and suggests
that the levels of snRNPs are critical to motor neurons. Furthermore,
SMN(A111G) could not rescue Smn-null mice without SMN2, suggesting that
both SMN(A111G) and SMN from SMN2 may undergo intragenic complementation
in vivo to function in heteromeric complexes that have greater function
than either allele alone. The oligomer composed of limiting full-length
SMN and SMN(A111G) had substantial snRNP assembly activity. The SMN(A2G)
(A2G; 600354.0002) and SMN(A111G) alleles in vivo did not complement
each other, leading to the possibility that these mutations could affect
the same function.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
SPINAL MUSCULAR ATROPHY, MODIFIER OF
SMN2, GLY287ARG

In a 42-year-old woman with a mild form of SMA type III (253400),
despite a homozygous absence of SMN1 exon 7 (600354), Prior et al.
(2009) identified a homozygous 859G-C transversion in exon 7 of the SMN2
gene, resulting in a gly287-to-arg (G287R) substitution. In vitro
functional expression studies showed that the change resulted in the
creation of an exonic splicing enhancer element and increased the amount
of full-length SMN2 transcripts compared to wildtype. The SMN1 genotype
(0 SMN1, 0 SNM2) predicted a more severe disorder (SMA1; 253300), but
the SMN2 variant increased SMN2 transcripts, resulting in a less severe
phenotype. The same 859G-C transversion was identified in heterozygosity
in 2 additional unrelated patients with mild forms of SMA, who were
predicted to have a more severe form of the disorder from their
genotypes (0 SMN1/1 SMN2 and 0 SMN1, 2 SMN2).

609084	TITLE *609084 F-BOX AND LEUCINE-RICH REPEAT PROTEIN 18; FBXL18
;;FBL18
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the F-box protein family, such as FBXL18, are characterized
by an approximately 40-amino acid F-box motif. SCF complexes, formed by
SKP1 (601434), cullin (see CUL1; 603134), and F-box proteins, act as
protein-ubiquitin ligases. F-box proteins interact with SKP1 through the
F box, and they interact with ubiquitination targets through other
protein interaction domains (Jin et al., 2004).

CLONING

Jin et al. (2004) reported that the FBXL18 protein contains an F box
near its N terminus, followed by 10 leucine-rich repeats and a
transmembrane domain at the C terminus.

MAPPING

Jin et al. (2004) stated that the FBXL18 gene maps to chromosome 7p22.2
and the mouse Fbxl18 gene maps to chromosome 5G2.

;;ACID FINGER PROTEIN; AFP;;
ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 173, FORMERLY; ZNF173, FORMERLY
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Chu et al. (1995) performed positional cloning of short fragment cDNA
sequences from the class I region of the human major histocompatibility
complex (MHC) using a hybridization selection approach. They isolated
full-length cDNA clones and partial genomic clones encoding a protein
with 2 domains rich in cysteine and histidine similar to those
characteristic of metal-dependent DNA-binding proteins. The predicted
protein also contains a domain thought to form a coiled-coil, possibly
to promote dimerization. A third feature of the predicted protein is a
polyglutamic acid region near the carboxyl terminus. Because of these
properties, Chu et al. (1995) named the gene product acid-finger
protein, AFP (a designation used originally for alpha-fetoprotein (AFP;
104150)). Although the biologic role of AFP was unknown, one potential
function was binding of nucleic acids. The gene was expressed in
multiple tissues and conserved among mammals. In particular, the mouse
and human coding regions were highly conserved.

MAPPING

Chu et al. (1995) identified the AFP gene within the MHC on chromosome
6. It appeared that multiple AFP-like genes existed in this region of
the MHC.

605579	TITLE *605579 INTERFERON-INDUCED TRANSMEMBRANE PROTEIN 3; IFITM3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The 1-8 gene family, which includes IFITM1 (604456), IFITM2 (605578),
and IFITM3, is highly inducible by both type I (IFNA; (147660)/IFNB;
(147640)) and type II (IFNG; 147570) interferons (summary by Lewin et
al., 1991).

CLONING

By screening a lymphoid cell cosmid library with a probe corresponding
to the 3-prime untranslated region of IFITM1, Lewin et al. (1991)
isolated a cosmid containing the IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3 genes, which
they termed 9-27, 1-8D, and 1-8U, respectively, within a single 18-kb
fragment. The predicted 133-amino acid IFITM3 protein is approximately
90% identical to IFITM2, has an N-terminal signal sequence, 3 potential
phosphorylation sites, and a C-terminal leucine zipper. Sequence
variability is greatest at the C terminus. Immunoblot analysis showed
that in response to IFNA, all 3 IFITMs were expressed as 14-kD proteins
that could be further resolved by isoelectric focusing.

Everitt et al. (2012) reported that the IFITM3 gene encodes 2 splice
variants that differ by the presence or absence of the N-terminal 21
amino acids.

By whole-mount in situ hybridization, Lange et al. (2003) found that
expression of mouse fragilis, fragilis-2, and fragilis-3 was restricted
to the epiblast at embryonic days 5.5 and 6.5. By embryonic day 7.5, all
3 transcripts showed variable expression in a cluster of founder
premordial germ cells, and at embryonic days 11.5 and 12.5, all 3
transcripts were detected in gonadal germ cells. The 3 transcripts
showed unique patterns of expression in other tissues during mouse
development.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lewin et al. (1991) determined that the IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3 genes
each contain 2 exons, with interferon-stimulated response elements
(ISREs) in the immediately 5-prime flanking sequence of the
promoter/enhancer region. Unlike IFITM1, which has an ISRE and 2 CCAAT
boxes but lacks a TATA box, IFITM2 and IFITM3 have 2 ISREs and no TATA
or CCAAT boxes.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Lange et al. (2003) mapped the IFITM3 gene
to an IFITM gene cluster on chromosome 11p15.5. The order of the genes,
from telomere to centromere, is IFITM5 (614757), IFITM2, IFITM1, and
IFITM3, and the cluster spans about 26.5 kb. Lange et al. (2003) stated
that IFITM2 maps to the plus strand and that all other IFITM genes map
to the minus strand. However, Gross (2012) determined that, in addition
to IFITM2, the IFITM1 gene maps to the plus strand based on an alignment
of the IFITM1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC000897) with the genomic
sequence (GRCh37).

Lange et al. (2003) mapped the mouse Ifitm gene cluster to a region of
chromosome 7F5 that shares homology of synteny with human chromosome
11p15.5. The mouse Ifitm gene cluster contains 5 genes, whereas the
human cluster contains only 4 genes.

GENE FUNCTION

By Northern blot analysis of cells expressing IFITM genes, Lewin et al.
(1991) showed that IFITM2 was not as responsive to IFNA treatment as
IFITM3 or IFITM1.

Tanaka et al. (2005) determined that mouse Ifitm1 and Ifitm3 are
expressed on the cell surface of primordial germ cells in a
developmentally-regulated manner and that they appear to modulate cell
adhesion and influence cell differentiation. Ifitm1 activity was
required for primordial germ cell transit, and Ifitm1 acted as a
repulsive molecule, repelling non-Ifitm1-expressing primordial germ
cells from the mesoderm into the endoderm. In contrast, Ifitm3 was
expressed in migratory primordial germ cells and behaved as a homing
signal, enabling the cells to respond to environmental cues that guided
their localization. The guidance activities of Ifitm1 and Ifitm3 were
mediated by their unique N-terminal domains.

To test the role of IFITM3 in human influenza virus infection, Everitt
et al. (2012) assessed the IFITM3 alleles of individuals hospitalized
with seasonal or pandemic influenza H1N1/09 viruses. Everitt et al.
(2012) found that a statistically significant number of hospitalized
subjects showed enrichment for a minor IFITM3 allele (SNP dbSNP rs12252)
that alters a splice acceptor site, and functional assays showed that
IFITM3 carrying the minor CC genotype had reduced influenza virus
restriction in vitro (see 605579.0001). Everitt et al. (2012) concluded
that, taken together, their data revealed that the action of a single
intrinsic immune effector, IFITM3, profoundly alters the course of
influenza virus infection in mouse and humans.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

At the time of the report by Everitt et al. (2012), 13 nonsynonymous, 13
synonymous, 1 in-frame stop, and 1 splice site acceptor-altering SNPs
had been reported in the IFITM3 sequence.

EVOLUTION

By phylogenetic analysis, Lange et al. (2003) found that only 2 mouse
fragilis genes, fragilis-4 (Ifitm5) and either fragilis (Ifitm3),
fragilis-2 (Ifitm1), or fragilis-3 (Ifitm2), have been conserved from
mouse to human. They suggested that subsequent gene duplications may
have occurred independently in both species.

ANIMAL MODEL

Everitt et al. (2012) used a knockout mouse model developed by Lange et
al. (2008) to test whether the IFITM proteins are critical for intrinsic
resistance to influenza virus. Everitt et al. (2012) observed that mice
lacking Ifitm3 displayed fulminant viral pneumonia when challenged with
a normally low-pathogenicity influenza virus, mirroring the destruction
inflicted by the highly pathogenic 1918 'Spanish' influenza. Similar
increased viral replication was seen in vitro, with protection rescued
by the reintroduction of Ifitm3.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
INFLUENZA, SEVERE, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
IFITM3, 42T-C

In 53 individuals with severe influenza infection (614680) who required
hospitalization as a result of pandemic HIN1/09 or seasonal influenza
virus infection in 2009-2010, Everitt et al. (2012) found enrichment of
a SNP in the IFITM3 gene, the C allele of SNP dbSNP rs12252. Presence of
the C allele results in a synonymous change but alters the first splice
acceptor site and may be associated with an IFITM3 splice variant that
encodes an IFITM3 protein lacking the first 21 amino acids due to the
use of an alternative start codon. When lymphoblastoid cell lines from
CC homozygotes were challenged with influenza A virus, they were far
more susceptible to infection than those of TT homozygotes, and this
vulnerability correlated with lower levels of IFITM3 protein expression
compared to the majority TT variant cells. Everitt et al. (2012) also
found that cells expressing the 21-amino acid deletion protein failed to
restrict viral replication when compared to wildtype IFITM3, consistent
with data showing that the amino-terminal 21 amino acids of IFITM3 are
required for attenuation of vesicular stomatitis virus replication in
vitro (Weidner et al., 2010).

605002	TITLE *605002 CORONIN 2B; CORO2B
;;CORONIN-LIKE PROTEIN C; CLIPINC
DESCRIPTION The Dictyostelium actin-binding protein coronin accumulates at the
leading edges of motile cells and in crown-shaped extensions on the
dorsal cell surface. Coronin is involved in cell motility, cytokinesis,
and phagocytosis, all of which depend on cytoskeletal rearrangement; see
CORO1A (605000).

By screening a frontal cortex cDNA library with a brain-enriched clone
showing similarity to Dictyostelium coronin, Nakamura et al. (1999)
isolated a full-length cDNA encoding CORO2B, which they called CLIPINC.
The predicted 475-amino acid CORO2B protein has an N-terminal domain
containing 5 WD repeats and a succeeding domain with a tendency to form
alpha helices. Northern blot analysis detected abundant expression of an
approximately 4.0-kb CORO2B transcript in brain, with moderate
expression in heart and ovary, and little or no expression in other
tissues tested. In contrast, CORO1A is primarily expressed in immune
system tissues, and CORO2A (602159) is predominantly expressed in colon,
prostate, and testis. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed Coro2a
expression in mouse cerebral cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, olfactory
bulb, and cerebellum, as well as in the inner nuclear layer of embryonic
retina and embryonic olfactory bulb. Cosedimentation analysis
demonstrated that CORO2B associates with F-actin. Immunofluorescence
analysis indicated that CORO2B accumulates at neurite tips, at focal
adhesions in association with VCL (193065), and along stress fibers.

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1999) mapped the CORO2B
gene, which they called KIAA0925, to chromosome 15.

;;OTF, LYMPHOID-SPECIFIC, 1; OTF1;;
OCTAMER-BINDING TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR 1; OCT1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The OCT1 transcription factor was among the first identified members of
the POU transcription factor family. Members of this family contain the
POU domain, a 160-amino acid region necessary for DNA binding to the
octameric sequence ATGCAAAT (summary by Sturm et al., 1993).

CLONING

Sturm et al. (1993) obtained an OTF1 cDNA clone whose open reading frame
encoded 766 amino acids.

GENE STRUCTURE

Sturm et al. (1993) demonstrated that the OTF1 gene contains 16 exons
spanning over 150 kb.

GENE FUNCTION

POU domain proteins contain a bipartite DNA-binding domain divided by a
flexible linker that enables them to adopt various monomer
configurations on DNA. The versatility of POU protein operation is
additionally conferred at the dimerization level. Tomilin et al. (2000)
found that the POU dimer from the OCT1 gene formed on the palindromic
OCT factor recognition element, or PORE (ATTTGAAATGCAAAT), could recruit
the transcriptional coactivator OBF1 (601206), whereas POU dimers formed
on the consensus MORE (more PORE) (ATGCATATGCAT) or on MOREs from
immunoglobulin heavy chain promoters (AT[G/A][C/A]ATATGCAA) failed to
interact. An interaction with OBF1 was precluded since the same OCT1
residues that form the MORE dimerization interface are also used for
OBF1/OCT1 interactions on the PORE. These findings provided a paradigm
of how specific POU dimer assemblies can differentially recruit a
coregulatory activity with distinct transcriptional readouts.

MAPPING

Hsieh et al. (1989, 1990) used a panel of somatic cell hybrids,
including a set of hybrids containing partially overlapping regions of
chromosome 1, to assign the OCT1 gene to human chromosome 1cen-q32. In
the course of constructing a physical map of human 1q23-q25, Oakey et
al. (1992) demonstrated that OTF1 is in the midportion of this segment,
not far from CD3Z (186780).

By studies of an interspecific backcross and recombinant inbred strains,
Siracusa et al. (1991) mapped Otf-1 to mouse chromosome 1.

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Sturm et al. (1995) concluded
that the OTF1 gene is located on 1q22-q23. The physical linkage of the
CD3Z gene to OTF1 means that the CD3Z gene is also located on 1q22-q23.

134636	TITLE *134636 FARNESYLTRANSFERASE, CAAX BOX, BETA; FNTB
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The CAAX farnesyltransferase (FTase) is an alpha/beta heterodimeric
enzyme that attaches a farnesyl group to a single cysteine in several
cellular proteins, all of which end with a 'CAAX box,' where C is
cysteine, A is an aliphatic amino acid, and X is methionine or serine.
This posttranslational modification provides a mechanism for membrane
localization of proteins that lack a transmembrane domain (summary by
Andres et al., 1993).

CLONING

Using rat FNTA (132635) and FNTB cDNA, Andres et al. (1993) cloned the
corresponding human cDNAs. FNTB encodes a predicted 487-amino acid
protein that shares 96% sequence identity with the rat homolog.

MAPPING

Andres et al. (1993) localized the FNTB gene to 14q23-q24 by Southern
blot hybridization and PCR analyses of panels of human/Chinese hamster
somatic cell hybrid lines and by fluorescence chromosomal in situ
hybridization. They found a related farnesyltransferase gene, FNTBL1, on
chromosome 9.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Long et al. (2002) presented a complete series of structures
representing the major steps along the reaction coordinate of the enzyme
protein farnesyltransferase. From these observations, Long et al. (2002)
deduced the determinants of substrate specificity and an unusual
mechanism in which product release requires binding of substrate,
analogous to classically processive enzymes. A structural model for the
transition state consistent with previous mechanistic studies was also
constructed.

ANIMAL MODEL

Lee et al. (2010) used conditional knockout alleles for Fntb, Pggt1b
(602031), which encodes the beta subunit of GGTase-I, and a keratin-14
(KRT14; 148066)-Cre transgene to create mice lacking FTase or GGTase-I
in skin keratinocytes. Keratinocyte-specific Fntb knockout mice were
viable but developed severe alopecia. The interfollicular epidermis of
Fntb-deficient mice appeared normal; however, keratinocytes from these
mice could not proliferate in culture. As expected, nonfarnesylated
prelamin A (LMNA; 150330) and nonfarnesylated DNAJA1 (602837)
accumulated in Fntb-deficient keratinocytes. Keratinocyte-specific
Pggt1b knockout mice survived development but died shortly after birth.
Like Fntb-deficient keratinocytes, Pggt1b-deficient keratinocytes did
not proliferate in culture. Lee et al. (2010) concluded that both FTase
and GGTase-I are required for the homeostasis of skin keratinocytes.

605385	TITLE *605385 PRENYL PROTEIN PROTEASE RCE1; RCE1
DESCRIPTION Protein prenylation plays a vital role in the membrane localization and
function of some proteins. Proteins containing C-terminal CAAX sequence
motifs undergo several posttranslational processing steps. First, the
cysteine is modified by specific transferases that covalently attach
prenyl lipids, either a 15-carbon farnesyl or a 20-carbon geranylgeranyl
isoprenyl lipid. A specific protease then cleaves the AAX tripeptide
from the protein, leaving the prenylated cysteine as the new C terminus.
The final modification is methylation of the carboxyl group of the now
C-terminal prenylcysteine.

CLONING

A genetic screen in S. cerevisiae resulted in the identification of a
candidate gene for a prenyl protein protease, RCE1 (Boyartchuk et al.,
1997). In a database search, Otto et al. (1999) identified a human EST
as a potential homolog of yeast RCE1. A full-length RCE1 cDNA was
assembled from clones isolated from a human fetal brain cDNA library and
a HUVEC cDNA library. RCE1 encodes a deduced 329-amino acid protein that
shares 42% identity over 105 amino acids with the yeast protein and
contains several predicted transmembrane domains. By Northern blot
analysis, Otto et al. (1999) detected a 1.8-kb RCE1 transcript in heart,
brain, placenta, lung, liver, muscle, kidney, and pancreas. A weaker
2.4-kb transcript was also detected in some tissues. Northern blot
analysis of mouse tissues revealed broad expression and multiple
transcript sizes. Otto et al. (1999) concluded that these transcripts
may represent alternatively spliced variants of RCE1.

Freije et al. (1999) identified RCE1, which they called FACE2, by EST
database searching for sequences with similarity to yeast Rce1, a
protein essential for the proteolytic processing of yeast
farnesylated/prenylated proteins. They cloned a human RCE1 cDNA from an
ovary cDNA library and found that it encodes a deduced 329-amino acid
protein with an HXXE motif characteristic of some metalloproteinases.
Freije et al. (1999) identified regions of high hydrophobicity,
consistent with RCE1 being a polytopic integral membrane protein. Using
in vitro translation product for SDS-PAGE analysis, they detected a
30-kD RCE1 protein. Northern blot analysis detected ubiquitous
expression of a 1.4-kb RCE1 transcript.

Otto et al. (1999) detected a high level of prenyl protease activity
with both yeast and human RCE1 proteins expressed in a recombinant
baculovirus system. The partial recombinant human RCE1 clone used all
forms of Ras as substrates, suggesting that the enzyme can use a broad
range of CAAX-type prenyl protein substrates. By competition studies,
Otto et al. (1999) demonstrated that the protease activity of human RCE1
activity is specific for prenylated proteins and that RCE1 recognizes
short prenylated peptides.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis and FISH, Freije et al. (1999) mapped the
RCE1 gene to chromosome 11q13, a region frequently amplified in
carcinomas and lymphomas.

605892	TITLE *605892 EH DOMAIN-CONTAINING 4; EHD4
DESCRIPTION By screening a human fetal brain cDNA library with exons derived from a
BAC mapping to the 19q13.3 glioma tumor suppressor candidate region,
Pohl et al. (2000) identified 3 novel genes, designated EHD2 (605890),
EHD3 (605891), and EHD4, which are homologous to human EHD1 (605888).
The deduced protein identities between EHD1 and EHD2, between EHD1 and
EHD3, and between EHD1 and EHD4, are 71%, 86%, and 76%, respectively.
All contain multiple conserved regions that include a nucleotide-binding
consensus site at the N terminus, a bipartite nuclear localization
signal, and an eps15 homology (EH) protein-binding domain with an
EF-hand motif at the C terminus. EHD4 encodes a deduced 482-amino acid
protein. Northern blot analysis detected expression of 4 mRNA species of
approximately 2.0, 2.7, 3.2, and 3.6 kb. All of the transcripts are
highly expressed in pancreas, and the 2.7- and 3.6-kb transcripts are
highly expressed in heart. Only weak expression is found in other
tissues.

By radiation hybrid analysis, Pohl et al. (2000) mapped the EHD4 gene to
chromosome 15q11.1.

102750	TITLE *102750 ADENOSINE KINASE; ADK
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The ADK gene encodes adenosine kinase (ATP:adenosine
5-prime-phosphotransferase; EC 2.7.1.20), an abundant enzyme in
mammalian tissues that catalyzes the transfer of the gamma-phosphate
from ATP to adenosine, thereby serving as a potentially important
regulator of concentrations of both extracellular adenosine and
intracellular adenine nucleotides. Adenosine has widespread effects on
the cardiovascular, nervous, respiratory, and immune systems, and
inhibitors of ADK could play an important pharmacologic role in
increasing intravascular adenosine concentrations and acting as
inflammatory agents (summary by Spychala et al., 1996).

CLONING

Spychala et al. (1996) obtained full-length cDNA clones encoding
catalytically active ADK from lymphocyte, placental, and liver cDNA
libraries. On Northern blots of all tissues examined, they identified
mRNA species of 1.3 and 1.8 kb, attributable to alternative
polyadenylation sites at the 3-prime end of the gene. The encoded
protein consisted of 345 amino acids with a calculated molecular size of
38.7 kD and without any sequence similarities to other
well-characterized mammalian nucleoside kinases. In contrast, 2 regions
were identified with significant sequence identity to microbial
ribokinase and fructokinases and a bacterial inosine/guanosine kinase.
Thus, ADK is a structurally distinct mammalian nucleoside kinase that
appears to be akin to sugar kinases of microbial origin.

McNally et al. (1997) also cloned human cDNAs encoding adenosine kinase.
They found cDNAs encoding both the 345-amino acid form and a 362-amino
acid form of the enzyme. These 2 alternately spliced forms differed only
at the 5-prime end. When expressed, both isoforms of the enzyme
phosphorylated adenosine with identical kinetics and both required Mg2+
for activity.

MAPPING

The structural gene for this enzyme was tentatively assigned to
chromosome 10 by somatic cell hybrid studies (Klobutcher et al., 1976).
By the principle of gene dosage, Francke and Thompson (1979) concluded
by exclusion that ADK must be in the region 10q11-10q24.

In a case of trisomy 10p, Snyder et al. (1984) found normal levels of
ADK.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

By exome sequencing, Bjursell et al. (2011) identified a homozygous
mutation in the ADK gene (102750.0001) in 2 Swedish sibs with severe
developmental delay, mild liver dysfunction, and persistent
hypermethioninemia due to adenosine kinase deficiency (614300).
Subsequent analysis of this gene in Malaysian patients with a similar
phenotype revealed 2 different homozygous mutations in the ADK gene
(102750.0002 and 102750.0003) in 2 families. The phenotype was
characterized by global developmental delay, early-onset seizures, mild
dysmorphic features, and characteristic biochemical anomalies, including
persistent hypermethioninemia with increased levels of
S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) and S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy);
homocysteine was typically normal. Bjursell et al. (2011) concluded that
the phenotype resulted from a combination of direct adenosine toxicity,
a defect in the regulation of adenosine, and disruption of a wide range
of methyltransferase reactions.

ANIMAL MODEL

Neonatal hepatic steatosis (228100) is a fatal condition characterized
by rapid microvesicular fat infiltration and enlargement of the liver,
which shows a pale and yellowish coloration. Microvesicular fat
infiltration, liver failure, coma, and death are considered to be a
consequence of severe impairment of mitochondrial function. Boison et
al. (2002) pursued the hypothesis that a deficit in adenosine-dependent
metabolism is a causative factor for the development of microvesicular
hepatic steatosis. A deficiency of adenosine kinase, the major
adenosine-removing enzyme of postnatal liver, was expected to affect
liver function on 3 levels: availability of adenine nucleotides;
disruption of the futile cycle between AMP and adenosine; and
maintenance of transmethylation reactions. Homozygous Adk -/- mice,
generated through Adk targeting of embryonic stem cells, developed
normally during embryogenesis. However, within 4 days after birth they
displayed microvesicular hepatic steatosis and died within 14 days with
fatty liver. Adenine nucleotides were decreased and
S-adenosylhomocysteine, a potent inhibitor of transmethylation
reactions, was increased in the mutant liver. Thus, a deficiency of
adenosine metabolism is identified as a powerful contributor to the
development of neonatal hepatic steatosis, providing a model for the
rapid development of postnatally lethal fatty liver.

In 2 Swedish sibs with hypermethioninemia due to adenosine kinase
deficiency (614300), Bjursell et al. (2011) identified a homozygous
902C-A transversion in the ADK gene, resulting in an ala301-to-glu
(A301E) substitution adjacent to the catalytic site. Each unaffected

substitution close to the binding site for adenosine. Each unaffected
parent was heterozygous for the mutation. In vitro functional expression
studies in E. coli showed that the mutant protein had about 10% residual
enzymatic activity compared to wildtype.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The HSD17B4 gene encodes an enzyme involved in peroxisomal fatty acid
beta-oxidation. It was first identified as a 17-beta-estradiol
dehydrogenase (Leenders et al., 1996; van Grunsven et al., 1998).

Peroxisomal beta-oxidation of fatty acids, originally described by
Lazarow and de Duve (1976), is catalyzed by 3 enzymes: acyl-CoA oxidase
(see, e.g., ACOX1, 609751); the 'D-bifunctional enzyme,' with
enoyl-CoA-hydratase and D-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity, and
3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (604054).

See also the L-bifunctional peroxisomal protein (EHHADH; 607037). The D-
and L-bifunctional proteins have different substrate specificities. The
D-bifunctional protein catalyzes the formation of 3-ketoacyl-CoA
intermediates from both straight-chain and 2-methyl-branched-chain fatty
acids and also acts in shortening cholesterol for bile acid formation.
In contrast, the L-specific bifunctional protein does not have the
latter 2 activities (Jiang et al., 1997).

CLONING

Adamski et al. (1995) cloned a fourth type of 17-beta-hydroxysteroid
dehydrogenase, HSD17B4, from a human liver cDNA library. The HSD17B4
gene encodes a 736-amino acid polypeptide with a predicted molecular
mass of approximately 80 kD and less than 25% identity with the 3
previously characterized 17-HSDs (HSD17B1, 109684; HSD17B2, 109685; and
HSD17B3, 605573). Northern blot analysis revealed that HSD17B4 is
expressed in many tissues as an approximately 3.0-kb mRNA transcript,
with highest expression in liver, heart, prostate, and testis. Adamski
et al. (1995) overexpressed the gene in mammalian cells and found that
HSD17B4 displays specific unidirectional oxidative 17-HSD activity.

Jiang et al. (1996) purified and characterized a medium-chain enoyl-CoA
hydratase from human liver. By immunohistochemistry, they confirmed the
presence of the enzyme in peroxisomes of cultured human skin
fibroblasts. Jiang et al. (1997) determined the DNA and peptide
sequences of medium-chain enoyl-CoA hydratase and found that it was
identical to that of human 17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase IV. The
native enzyme is a 77-kD polypeptide.

By analysis of the porcine enzyme, Leenders et al. (1996) determined
that the N-terminal region (residues 1-323) encodes the 17-steroid
dehydrogenase activity, whereas the central region (residues 324-596)
catalyzes the hydratase activity. The C-terminal portion facilitates the
transfer of 7-dehydrocholesterol and phosphatidylcholine between
membranes in vitro. The authors emphasized the unique ability of a
single protein to catalyze different reactions.

GENE STRUCTURE

Leenders et al. (1998) found that the HSD17B4 gene contains 24 exons and
spans more than 100 kb.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Leenders et al. (1996) mapped the
HSD17B4 gene to human chromosome 5q2.

GENE FUNCTION

Green et al. (1999) investigated HSD17B1, -2, -3, and -4 gene expression
and HSD17B estrogenic activity in human anterior pituitary adenomas.
HSD17B mRNA expression was studied by RT-PCR in 42 pituitary tumors and
3 normal pituitaries, HSD17B activity was studied in 11 tumors, and
HSD17B1 was immunolocalized in vitro in 6 tumors. HSD17B1 gene
expression was detected in 34 of 42 (81%) adenomas in all tumor
subtypes; HSD17B2 mRNA was detected in 18 of 42 (43%) adenomas but not
in prolactinomas; HSD17B3 mRNA was detected in 12 of 42 (29%) adenomas
but not in corticotropinomas; and HSD17B4 was expressed in 20 of 42
(48%) adenomas by all adenoma subtypes. All 4 HSD17B isoforms were
variably expressed in human anterior pituitary adenomas, which also
showed HSD17B enzyme activity, suggesting that HSD17B may play an
important role in regulating the local cellular levels of estradiol.

In 2 Japanese patients with D-bifunctional protein deficiency (261515),
Suzuki et al. (1997) identified 2 different homozygous mutations in the
HSD17B4 gene (601860.0001; 601860.0002). The patients had previously
been diagnosed with L-bifunctional protein deficiency by complementation
analysis (Suzuki et al., 1994).

In an infant with a defect in peroxisomal beta-oxidation, van Grunsven
et al. (1998) demonstrated D-bifunctional protein deficiency caused by a
homozygous mutation in the HSD17B4 gene (601860.0003).

In a patient with D-bifunctional protein deficiency originally reported
by Watkins et al. (1989), van Grunsven et al. (1999) identified a
homozygous 2-bp deletion in the HSD17B4 gene (601860.0007). The patient
was originally thought to have L-bifunctional protein deficiency based
on immunoblot analysis of postmortem liver tissue. However, reanalysis
showed accumulation of both very long chain fatty acids and bile acid
intermediates, which was hard to reconcile with an isolated deficiency
of the L-bifunctional protein. The results suggested that most, if not
all, patients whose peroxisomal disorder had been diagnosed as
L-bifunctional protein deficiency were in fact cases of D-bifunctional
protein deficiency.

Nakano et al. (2001) reported a patient with D-bifunctional protein
deficiency who was compound heterozygous for 2 mutations in the HSD17B4
gene (601860.0001 and 601860.0005).

Ferdinandusse et al. (2002) reinvestigated the patient of Goldfischer et
al. (1986), who was the only patient ever reported with a presumed
deficiency of peroxisomal 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (604054). Molecular
analysis identified a homozygous deletion in the HSD17B4 gene
(601860.0006), confirming a diagnosis of D-bifunctional protein
deficiency.

Ferdinandusse et al. (2006) reported the mutational spectrum of DBP
deficiency on the basis of molecular analysis in 110 patients. They
identified 61 different mutations by DBP cDNA analysis, 48 of which had
not been previously reported. The predicted effects of the different
disease-causing amino acid changes in protein structure were determined
using the crystal structures. The effects ranged from the replacement of
catalytic amino acid residues or residues in direct contact with the
substrate or cofactor to disturbances of protein folding or dimerization
of the subunits. To study whether there is a genotype-phenotype
correlation for DBP deficiency, these structure-based analyses were
combined with extensive biochemical analyses of patient material
(cultured skin fibroblasts and plasma) and available clinical
information on the patients. They found that the effect of the mutations
identified in patients with a relatively mild clinical and biochemical
presentation was less detrimental to the protein structure than the
effect of mutations identified in those with a very severe presentation.
These results suggested that the amount of residual DBP activity
correlates with the severity of the phenotype. Thus the data indicated
that on the basis of the predicted effect of mutations on protein
structure, a genotype-phenotype correlation exists for DBP deficiency.

Ferdinandusse et al. (2006) found that the missense mutation G16S
(601860.0003) is by far the most common mutation causing DBP deficiency
(type III), which had in their study an allele frequency of
approximately 24% and was detected in 28 of the 110 patients. The second
most common mutation causing DBP deficiency (type II) was the missense
mutation N457Y (601860.0004), which had an allele frequency of
approximately 11% and was found in 13 patients. Of 5 patients for whom
homozygosity was checked, 2 turned out to be heterozygotes at the
genomic level.

In DBP type I-deficient patients, Ferdinandusse et al. (2006) found only
deletions, insertions, and nonsense mutations. All deletions resulted in
a truncated protein, except for 3 large in-frame deletions. Two patients
with DBP type-II deficiency had in-frame deletions in the hydratase
unit. All other DBP type II-deficient patients had missense mutations in
the coding region of the DBP hydratase unit. DBP type III deficiency was
predominantly caused by missense mutations and, in 2 cases, by a 1-amino
acid deletion in the coding region of the dehydrogenase unit.

- Perrault Syndrome 1

Pierce et al. (2010) performed whole-exome sequencing of genomic DNA
from a woman with Perrault syndrome-1 (PRLTS1; 233400), which is
characterized by ovarian dysgenesis and sensorineural deafness,
originally described by McCarthy and Opitz (1985) and identified 2 rare
variants in the HSD17B4 gene (601860.0008 and 601860.0009). Sequencing
revealed that both the proband and her affected sister were compound
heterozygous for the missense (Y217C) and nonsense (Y568X) mutations,
and that their unaffected mother was heterozygous for the missense
mutation. Pierce et al. (2010) noted that Perrault syndrome and DBP
deficiency overlap clinically, and suggested that mutations in HSD17B4
leading to DBP deficiency that is mild enough to allow survival to the
age of puberty are likely to cause ovarian dysgenesis in females in
addition to the known neurologic defects. The authors predicted that
because the affected sisters were likely to express only protein with
the Y217C mutation, they would have so-called type III DBP deficiency,
with a defect in dehydrogenase activity.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
D-BIFUNCTIONAL PROTEIN DEFICIENCY
HSD17B4, 52-BP DEL

In a Japanese patient with D-bifunctional protein deficiency (261515),
Suzuki et al. (1997) identified a 52-bp deletion in the HSD17B4 gene,
resulting in a 17-amino acid deletion and premature termination. Studies
of postmortem liver tissue confirmed absence of the activity and
immunoreactivity of D-bifunctional protein. The patient was previously
thought to have L-bifunctional protein deficiency (Suzuki et al., 1994).

.0002
D-BIFUNCTIONAL PROTEIN DEFICIENCY
HSD17B4, 237-BP DEL

In a Japanese patient with D-bifunctional protein deficiency (261515),
Suzuki et al. (1997) identified a 237-bp deletion in the HSD17B4 gene,
resulting in a 79-amino acid deletion. Studies of postmortem liver
tissue confirmed absence of the activity and immunoreactivity of
D-bifunctional protein. The patient was previously thought to have
L-bifunctional protein deficiency (Suzuki et al., 1994).

.0003
D-BIFUNCTIONAL PROTEIN DEFICIENCY
HSD17B4, GLY16SER

In an infant with a D-bifunctional protein deficiency (261515), van
Grunsven et al. (1998) identified a 46G-A transition in the HSD17B4
gene, resulting in a gly16-to-ser (G16S) substitution within an
important loop of the Rossman fold forming the NAD(+)-binding site.
Biochemical analysis showed that the 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase
activity of the D-bifunctional protein was completely inactive, whereas
the enoyl-CoA hydratase component was active. Their findings showed that
the D-bifunctional protein plays an essential role in the peroxisomal
beta-oxidation pathway that cannot be compensated for by the L-specific
bifunctional protein. Both parents were heterozygous for the mutation.

Van Grunsven et al. (1999) demonstrated the G16S mutation in 9
additional patients previously thought to have deficiency of
L-bifunctional protein on the basis of complementation studies. The
findings confirmed D-bifunctional protein deficiency in these cases.

.0004
D-BIFUNCTIONAL PROTEIN DEFICIENCY
HSD17B4, ASN457TYR

In 2 unrelated patients with D-bifunctional protein deficiency (261515),
van Grunsven et al. (1999) identified a homozygous 1369A-T transversion
in the HSD17B4 gene, resulting in an asn457-to-tyr (N457Y) substitution.
Both patients had an isolated defect of the enoyl-CoA hydratase domain
of the D-bifunctional protein. Both patients had abnormalities of
peroxisomal beta-oxidation with elevated very long chain fatty acids and
branch chain fatty acids, but normal levels of bile acid intermediates.
Both patients were born of consanguineous parents. Sequence analysis of
the D-bifunctional protein cDNA of 15 control subjects of Caucasian
origin did not identify the N457Y mutation. Expression of the N457Y
mutation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae confirmed that it is the
disease-causing mutation. Immunoblot analysis of patient fibroblast
homogenates showed that the protein levels of full-length D-bifunctional
protein were strongly reduced, while the enoyl-CoA hydratase component
produced after processing within the peroxisome was undetectable,
indicating that the mutation leads to an unstable protein.

.0005
D-BIFUNCTIONAL PROTEIN DEFICIENCY
HSD17B4, ARG106PRO

In a male patient with D-bifunctional protein deficiency (261515),
Nakano et al. (2001) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations
in the HSD17B4 gene: a 317G-C transversion, resulting in an
arg106-to-pro (R106P) substitution, and a 52-bp deletion (601860.0001).
The mutations were associated with complete loss of function of the
protein.

.0006
D-BIFUNCTIONAL PROTEIN DEFICIENCY
HSD17B4, 138-BP DEL

In a patient with D-bifunctional protein deficiency (261515),
Ferdinandusse et al. (2002) identified a homozygous 138-bp deletion in
the HSD17B4 gene extending from basepair 145 in exon 3 through the first
63 basepairs of intron 3 of the DBP gene. This deletion resulted in
skipping of exon 3. The patient had originally been reported by
Goldfischer et al. (1986) and Schram et al. (1987) as the only patient
ever reported to have peroxisomal 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (604054)
deficiency. However, reanalysis showed normal thiolase and absence of
the D-bifunctional protein in brain tissue.

.0007
D-BIFUNCTIONAL PROTEIN DEFICIENCY
HSD17B4, 2-BP DEL, 422AG

In a patient with D-bifunctional protein deficiency (261515) originally
reported by Watkins et al. (1989), van Grunsven et al. (1999) identified
a homozygous 2-bp deletion (422delAG) in the HSD17B4 gene, resulting in
a premature stop codon at position 490 and a shortened protein of 163
amino acids. The patient was originally thought to have L-bifunctional
protein deficiency.

.0008
PERRAULT SYNDROME 1
HSD17B4, TYR217CYS

In 2 sisters with Perrault syndrome-1 (233400), previously described by
McCarthy and Opitz (1985) and Fiumara et al. (2004), Pierce et al.
(2010) identified compound heterozygosity for a 605A-G transition in
exon 9 of the HSD17B4 gene, resulting in a tyr217-to-cys (Y217C)
substitution in a very highly conserved region of the protein, and a
1704T-A transversion in exon 20, resulting in a tyr568-to-ter (Y568X;
601860.0009) substitution. Their unaffected mother was found to be
heterozygous for the Y217C mutation, and neither mutation was detected
in 1,092 control individuals. Expression analysis using lymphoblast cDNA
showed that Y568X transcript was expressed at very low levels relative
to the Y217C transcript, suggesting that Y568X undergoes
nonsense-mediated decay, whereas Y217C is more stably expressed.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Chow and Lee (1996) reported the cDNA sequence of DENN, a novel human
gene that is differentially expressed in normal and neoplastic cells
(hence, the symbol DENN). Northern blot analysis revealed differential
levels of expression of a 6.5-kb DENN transcript in malignant cell lines
compared to normal human tissues, where expression was highest in fetal
brain and kidney and in adult testis, ovary, brain, and heart. In fetal
liver and in several human cancer cell lines, the authors identified
cDNAs representing alternative transcripts of DENN that harbor a
deletion of 129 bp encoding 43 amino acids. Present within the serine-
and leucine-rich DENN gene product is an arginyl-glycyl-aspartic acid
(RGD) cellular adhesion motif and a leucine zipper-like motif.

Using the yeast interaction trap system to identify proteins that
interact with the death domain of the type-1 tumor necrosis factor
receptor (TNFR1; 191190), Schievella et al. (1997) isolated cDNAs
encoding 'MAP kinase-activating death domain' (MADD) protein.
Immunoblotting of immunoprecipitated proteins from various human cell
lines detected an approximately 200-kD MADD protein. The deduced
1,588-amino acid MADD protein contains a C-terminal death domain.

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1997) cloned KIAA0358. The deduced protein
contains 1,581 amino acids and is nearly identical to DENN.

Chow et al. (1998) stated that the DENN and MADD cDNAs and proteins are
virtually identical. From genomic studies, they traced the alternative
splicing of a 129-bp fragment to an alternative 5-prime donor site
involving exon 7. The deduced longer DENN isoform has 1,587 amino acids.
Western blot analysis of human MOLT-4 T-lymphoblastic leukemic cell
proteins detected a doublet consisting of 138- and 142-kD polypeptides.
The authors found the DENN protein concentrated predominantly in the
cytosolic compartment of MOLT-4 cells but was restricted to the nuclear
compartment of PLC/PRF/5 hepatoma cells.

Efimova et al. (2004) identified 7 putative splice variants of MADD:
IG20 full-length (IG20FL), IG20, KIAA0358, MADD (also referred to as
DENN), IG20 short variant-2 (IG20SV2), DENNSV (also referred to as
IG20SV3), and IG20SV4. These variants arise from alternative splicing of
exons 13L, 16, 21, 26, and 34. IG20FL, the longest variant, is encoded
by all 36 exons of the MADD gene. RT-PCR detected variable expression of
IG20, MADD, IG20SV, and DENNSV in all human tissues examined. Expression
of KIAA0358, IG20FL, and IG20SV4 was not observed.

GENE FUNCTION

Schievella et al. (1997) found that the MADD protein associated with
TNFR1 through a death domain-death domain interaction. Overexpression of
MADD activated the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase ERK2 (176948),
and expression of the MADD death domain stimulated both the ERK2 and
JNK1 (601158) MAP kinases and induced the phosphorylation of cytosolic
phospholipase A2 (600522). The authors suggested that MADD links TNFR1
with MAP kinase activation and arachidonic acid release.

Al-Zoubi et al. (2001) showed that HeLa cells permanently transfected
with IG20 or DENNSV were more susceptible or resistant to TNF-alpha
(TNFA; 191160)-induced apoptosis, respectively. All MADD variants tested
could interact with TNFR1 and activate ERK and NF-kappa-B (see 164011).
However, relative to control cells, only those expressing IG20 showed
enhanced TNF-alpha-induced activation of caspase-8 (CASP8; 601763) and
CASP3 (600636). Cowpox virus CrmA, an inhibitor of caspase-induced
apoptosis, inhibited apoptosis when transfected in IG20-expressing HeLa
cells.

Using specific small hairpin RNAs targeted to splice variants of the
MADD gene, Mulherkar et al. (2006) found that knockdown of the MADD
variant resulted in spontaneous apoptosis in HeLa cells and in a human
ovarian carcinoma cell line, and they demonstrated that the MADD variant
alone was necessary and sufficient for cancer cell survival. Mulherkar
et al. (2006) hypothesized that since the MADD variant can bind to death
receptors, it may prevent apoptotic signaling by interfering with death
receptor oligomerization.

Efimova et al. (2004) found that overexpression of DENNSV enhanced cell
replication and resistance to treatment with proapoptotic stimuli. In
contrast, IG20 expression suppressed cell replication and increased
susceptibility to proapoptotic stimuli. Moreover, cells that were
resistant or susceptible to TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis exclusively
expressed endogenous DENNSV and IG20, respectively. Transfection of IG20
in a DENNSV-expressing cell line overrode endogenous DENNSV function and
increased susceptibility to apoptotic stimuli. Dominant-negative
I-kappa-B (see NFKBIA; 164008) reversed the effects of DENNSV, but not
IG20, indicating that DENNSV functions through NF-kappa-B activation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Chow et al. (1998) determined that the MADD gene spans at least 28 kb
and contains 15 exons, ranging in size from 73 to 1,230 bp.

Efimova et al. (2004) determined that the MADD gene contains 36 exons.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1997) mapped the MADD gene
to chromosome 11. Using FISH, Chow et al. (1998) mapped the MADD gene to
chromosome 11p11.2.

602023	TITLE *602023 CHLORIDE CHANNEL, KIDNEY, B; CLCNKB
;;CLCKB
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The CLCNKA and CLCNKB channels are members of the ClC family, which
comprises at least 9 mammalian chloride channels. Each is believed to
have 12 transmembrane domains and intracellular N and C termini. The
prototype of the family in Torpedo is gated by both voltage and chloride
(Jentsch and Gunther, 1997).

CLONING

Kieferle et al. (1994) cloned rat and human homologs of 2 closely
related chloride channels found specifically in mammalian kidney, which
they called ClCK1 and ClCK2. In the rat, ClCK1 and ClCK2 appear to be
expressed along the nephron from the thin ascending limb of the Henle
loop onwards. The human homologs of these 2 genes, CLCNKA (602024) and
CLCNKB, encode proteins of 687 amino acids (Saito-Ohara et al., 1996).

GENE STRUCTURE

Simon et al. (1997) demonstrated that the intron-exon organization of
the CLCNKA and CLCNKB genes was identical, with each channel encoded by
19 exons. Overall, the genes show 94% DNA sequence identity in exons.
The 2 genes are transcribed from the same DNA strand, with CLCNKA
5-prime of CLCNKB. The 2 genes are separated by 11 kb of genomic DNA.

MAPPING

Saito-Ohara et al. (1996) mapped the CLCNKA and CLCNKB genes to
chromosome 1p36.

Considering CLCNKA and CLCNKB as candidate genes in families with
Bartter syndrome (607364), Simon et al. (1997) isolated PAC and cosmid
genomic clones encoding these genes. They found that both genes were
present in all 6 PAC clones, indicating that they are closely linked to
one another, as previously suggested by in situ hybridization using CLCK
cDNA (Saito-Ohara et al., 1996). Using a marker polymorphism in exon 13
of the CLCNKA gene, Simon et al. (1997) showed that in CEPH kindreds the
gene is linked to chromosome 1; a multipoint lod score of 15.8 at a
recombination fraction of 0.0 was obtained with D1S436.

GENE FUNCTION

Estevez et al. (2001) demonstrated that barttin (BSND; 606412) acts as
an essential beta subunit for CLCNKA and CLCNKB chloride channels, with
which it colocalizes in basolateral membranes of renal tubules and of
potassium-secreting epithelia of the inner ear. Disease-causing
mutations in either CLCNKB or barttin compromise currents through
heteromeric channels. Currents can be stimulated further by mutating a
proline-tyrosine (PY) motif on barttin. Estevez et al. (2001) concluded
that their work described the first known beta subunit for CLC chloride
channels and revealed that heteromers formed by chloride channels and
barttin are crucial for renal salt reabsorption and potassium recycling
in the inner ear.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Bartter Syndrome Type 3

In affected members of 10 kindreds with Bartter syndrome type 3
(607364), Simon et al. (1997) found homozygous deletion of the CLCNKB
gene. Two kindreds showed homozygous loss of part of CLCNKB. The tight
linkage and topology of CLCNKA and CLCNKB raised the question of unequal
crossing over between these genes or blocks of homologous flanking
sequences as a mechanism for deletion of CLCNKB sequences. Simon et al.
(1997) found reciprocal loss of CLCNKA and CLCNKB sequences consistent
with this mechanism. They also demonstrated 7 mutations altering the
CLCNKB gene and cosegregating with the disease (e.g., 602023.0001). In 4
kindreds, affected persons were homozygous for identified mutations, 2
index cases were compound heterozygotes, and a single mutation was
identified in 1 kindred.

Jeck et al. (2000) described 3 unrelated patients presenting with the
typical laboratory findings of Gitelman syndrome (263800). Mutation
analysis in these 3 patients revealed no abnormality in the SLC12A3
(600968) gene. Instead, all patients were found to carry previously
described mutations in the CLCNKB gene: 2 were homozygous for complete
deletion of the gene (602023.0006) and 1 was homozygous for an A-G
substitution at the splice acceptor site of intron 7 (602023.0007)
(Konrad et al., 2000). Further clinical investigation revealed features
more typical of Bartter syndrome than of Gitelman syndrome. Jeck et al.
(2000) suggested that the phenotypic overlap may indicate a physiologic
cooperation of the apical thiazide-sensitive NaCl cotransporter
(SLC12A3) and the basolateral chloride channel (CLCNKB) for salt
reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule.

Schurman et al. (2001) studied 5 African American children with Bartter
syndrome. Like the African American children reported by Simon et al.
(1997), these children demonstrated homozygous deletion of the CLCNKB
gene (602023.0006). They had partial correction of hypokalemia, normal
calciotropic activity, suboptimal growth despite therapy, and abnormal
renal ultrasounds but no nephrocalcinosis.

Fukuyama et al. (2004) reported 2 Japanese patients who suffered from
clinically diagnosed classic Bartter syndrome but who had hypocalciuria.
Hypocalciuria is believed to be a pathognomic finding of Na-Cl
cotransporter malfunction. They identified mutations in the CLCNKB gene,
including a premature termination mutation (602023.0009) and a splice
site mutation (602023.0010). The authors concluded that some CLCNKB
mutations may affect calcium handling in renal tubular cells.

- Bartter Syndrome Type 4B

In a child with renal salt wasting and deafness (Bartter syndrome type
4B; 613090) who had no mutation in the BSND gene (606412), Schlingmann
et al. (2004) identified both a homozygous deletion of the CLCNKB gene
(602023.0008) and a homozygous trp80-to-cys mutation in the CLCNKA gene
(W80C; 602024.0001). Because this combined impairment of the CLCNKA and
CLCNKB genes resulted in a phenotype mimicking the form of infantile
Bartter syndrome with sensorineural deafness caused by mutation in the
BSND gene (Bartter syndrome type 4A; 602522), Schlingmann et al. (2004)
concluded that this case with digenic inheritance supported the notion
that the CLCNK-type channels are regulated by barttin and offered strong
evidence of genetic heterogeneity in patients who have both severe renal
salt wasting and deafness.

Nozu et al. (2008) reported a 2-year-old Japanese girl with a severe
form of Bartter syndrome with sensorineural deafness who was born of
nonconsanguineous parents. Genetic analysis showed 2 heterozygous
mutations in the CLCNKA (602024.0002) and CLCNKB (602023.0011) genes on
the paternal allele, and a 12-kb deletion involving portions of the
CLCNKA and CLCNKB genes on the maternal allele. Neither parent was
clinically affected. The findings indicated clear digenic inheritance in
this patient and confirmed that loss of function of all 4 alleles of the
CLCNKA and CLCNKB genes can result in Bartter syndrome type 4B.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
BARTTER SYNDROME, TYPE 3
CLCNKB, PRO124LEU

In 2 apparently unrelated Turkish kindreds, Simon et al. (1997) found
that children with Bartter syndrome type 3 (607364) were homozygous for
the identical mutation, a substitution of leucine for proline at codon
124 of the CLCNKB gene. This proline residue is conserved among all
mammalian members of the CLC family.

.0002
BARTTER SYNDROME, TYPE 3
CLCNKB, ALA204THR

In 2 Spanish kindreds, Simon et al. (1997) found that individuals with
Bartter syndrome type 3 (607364) were homozygous for substitution of
threonine for alanine at codon 204 in the fifth transmembrane domain of
the CLCNKB gene. All CLC channel members, including the CLC-related
channel of yeast, have alanine or glycine at this position, within a
highly conserved hydrophobic segment (amino acids AAAA or AGAA).

.0003
BARTTER SYNDROME, TYPE 3
CLCNKB, ARG438CYS

One of the missense mutations in the CLCNKB gene identified by Simon et
al. (1997) in Bartter syndrome type 3 (607364) patients was arg438 to
cys (R438C), where R438 is conserved among all members of the CLC
family.

.0004
BARTTER SYNDROME, TYPE 3
CLCNKB, ALA349ASP

One of the missense mutations identified by Simon et al. (1997) in the
CLCNKB gene in patients with Bartter syndrome type 3 (607364) was ala349
to asp (A349D), which introduces a charged residue in the predicted
eighth transmembrane domain of the channel.

.0005
BARTTER SYNDROME, TYPE 3
CLCNKB, TYR432HIS

One of the mutations identified by Simon et al. (1997) in the CLCNKB
gene in Bartter syndrome type 3 (607364) patients was a tyr432-to-his
(Y432H) substitution.

.0006
BARTTER SYNDROME, TYPE 3
CLCNKB, DEL

In 3 patients, the offspring of consanguineous parents, presenting with
biochemical findings consistent with the diagnosis of Gitelman syndrome
(263800), Jeck et al. (2000) detected 2 mutations previously described
by Konrad et al. (2000): homozygous deletion of the CLCNKB gene was
present in 2 patients, and homozygous exchange of guanine for adenine at
the consensus acceptor site of intron 7 (602023.0007) was present in the
third. Review of medical history revealed early onset of the disease,
within the first year of life. Clinical presentation included episodes
of dehydration, weakness, and failure to thrive, much more suggestive of
classic Bartter syndrome (607364) than of Gitelman syndrome. The
coexistence of hypomagnesemia and hypocalciuria was not present from the
beginning. In the follow-up, a drop of both parameters below normal
range was a consistent finding reflecting a transition from classic
Bartter syndrome to Gitelman syndrome phenotype. Jeck et al. (2000)
suggested that the phenotypic overlap may indicate a physiologic
cooperation of the apical thiazide-sensitive NaCl cotransporter and the
basolateral chloride channel for salt reabsorption in the distal
convoluted tubule.

See 602023.0006 and Jeck et al. (2000).

.0008
BARTTER SYNDROME, TYPE 4B
CLCNKB, DEL

In a child with renal salt wasting and deafness (Bartter syndrome type
4B; 613090) who had no mutation in the BSND gene (606412), Schlingmann
et al. (2004) identified both a homozygous deletion of the CLCNKB gene
and a homozygous cys80-to-trp (C80W) mutation in the CLCNKA gene (C80W;
602024.0001). The patient was born prematurely to consanguineous
parents, and the pregnancy was complicated by severe maternal
polyhydramnios during the last 6 weeks of gestation.

.0009
BARTTER SYNDROME, TYPE 3, WITH HYPOCALCIURIA
CLCNKB, TRP610TER

In 2 Japanese patients who had been diagnosed with classic Bartter
syndrome (607364) but who presented with hypocalciuria, Fukuyama et al.
(2004) found a G-to-A transition at nucleotide 1830 in exon 16 of the
CLCNKB gene that resulted in premature termination (trp610 to ter;
W610X).

.0010
BARTTER SYNDROME, TYPE 3, WITH HYPOCALCIURIA
CLCNKB, IVS2AS, G-C, -1

In a Japanese patient who had been diagnosed with classic Bartter
syndrome (607364) but who presented with hypocalciuria, Fukuyama et al.
(2004) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the CLCNKB
gene. One was a G-to-C transversion at the 3-prime splice site of intron
2; the other was a premature termination mutation (W610X; 602023.0009).

.0011
BARTTER SYNDROME, TYPE 4B
CLCNKB, IVS17DS, G-A, +1

In a 2-year-old Japanese girl with a severe form of Bartter syndrome
with sensorineural deafness (613090), Nozu et al. (2008) identified a
heterozygous G-to-A transition in intron 7 of the CLCNKB gene, resulting
in a splice site mutation, and a heterozygous mutation in the CLCNKA
gene (Q260X; 602024.0002), both inherited from the father. The maternal
allele had a 12-kb deletion including portions of both CLCNKA and
CLCNKB. Neither parent was clinically affected. The findings indicated
clear digenic inheritance in this patient and confirmed that loss of
function of all 4 alleles of the CLCNKA and CLCNKB genes can result in
Bartter syndrome type 4B.

271150	TITLE #271150 SPINAL MUSCULAR ATROPHY, TYPE IV; SMA4
;;SPINAL MUSCULAR ATROPHY, ADULT FORM;;
SPINAL MUSCULAR ATROPHY, PROXIMAL, ADULT, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
DESCRIPTION A number sign (#) is used with this entry because autosomal recessive
adult-onset spinal muscular atrophy type IV (SMA4) is caused by mutation
or deletion in the SMN1 gene (600354).

Allelic disorders with overlapping phenotypes of differing severity and
age at onset include SMA type I (253300), SMA type II (253550), and SMA
type III (253400).

CLINICAL FEATURES

Pearn et al. (1978) described 9 patients from 6 families with
adult-onset spinal muscular atrophy. The median age at onset was 35
years, and the mean age at initial medical presentation was 37 years.
The condition was relatively benign, with symmetrical proximal muscle
involvement and preservation of the distal musculature. Family studies
suggested autosomal recessive inheritance.

Brahe et al. (1995) reported 6 patients from 4 families with autosomal
recessive adult-onset SMA. Age at onset ranged from 20 to 32 years, and
symptoms included tongue fasciculations, hand tremor, symmetrical
weakness of the proximal muscles that was more severe in the lower
limbs, and atrophy of the quadriceps muscle. Three patients had
bilateral hypertrophy of the calves. One patient was very mildly
affected; 3 patients had done military service, apparently without
problems. In a letter, Zerres et al. (1995) noted that they defined SMA
type IV as onset after age 30; patients with onset before age 30 years
who retained the ability to walk were defined as having SMA type III.

Clermont et al. (1995) reported a 73-year-old woman who developed type
IV SMA at age 47, with proximal muscle weakness, muscular atrophy, and
patellar areflexia. Three of her 5 children had SMA type II, and all
died before age 15 years. Molecular analysis showed that the mother had
deletion of SMN exons 7 and 8 on both chromosomes, but no DNA from the
children was available. Clermont et al. (1995) concluded that adult and
childhood SMA are allelic disorders, emphasizing the continuum of
clinical phenotypes caused by SMN gene mutations and deletions.

CLINICAL MANAGEMENT

Weihl et al. (2006) reported increased quantitative muscle strength and
subjective function in 7 adult patients with SMA3/SMA4 who were treated
with oral valproate for a mean duration of 8 months. Most patients
reported improvement within a few months of beginning treatment. The
authors noted that previous studies (see Brichta et al., 2003) had
suggested that inhibitors of histone deacetylase, such as valproate, may
increase SMN2 gene transcription and result in increased production of
full-length SMN protein.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 6 patients with SMA4, Brahe et al. (1995) identified deletion of
exons 7 and 8 of the SMN1 gene, indicating that autosomal recessive
adult SMA is allelic to the childhood forms of SMA.

Mazzei et al. (2004) found evidence for a gene conversion event in SMN1
in 3 patients with SMA4, supporting the notion that a gene conversion
event is usually associated with a milder SMA phenotype and a later age
at disease onset.

- Modifying Factors

Wirth et al. (2006) analyzed SMN2 copy number in 115 patients with SMA3
or SMA4 who had confirmed homozygous absence of SMN1 and found that 62%
of SMA3 patients with age of onset less than 3 years had 2 or 3 SMN2
copies, whereas 65% of SMA3 patients with age of onset greater than 3
years had 4 to 5 SMN2 copies. Of the 4 adult-onset (SMA4) patients, 3
had 4 SMN2 copies and 1 had 6 copies. Wirth et al. (2006) concluded that
SMN2 may have a disease-modifying role in SMA, with a greater SMN2 copy
number associated with later onset and better prognosis.

- Heterogeneity

Hahnen et al. (1995) reported 4 patients with onset of SMA after age 30
who showed no homozygous deletion of exons 7 and 8 of the SMN1 gene,
suggesting genetic heterogeneity. However, the 4 patients with presumed
SMA IV had no family history, and spontaneous autosomal dominant
mutation at a different locus could not be excluded.

150390	TITLE *150390 LATENT TRANSFORMING GROWTH FACTOR-BETA-BINDING PROTEIN 1; LTBP1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

All 3 transforming growth factor beta isoforms (e.g., TGFB1; 190180) are
secreted as large latent complexes that have no biologic activity. The
large latent complex has 3 components: a disulfide-bonded homodimer of
mature TGFB associated noncovalently with latency-associated proteins
(LAPs), which are homodimers of the N-terminal fragment of precursor
TGFB, and a covalently attached latent TGFB-binding protein (LTBP), such
as LTBP1. LAPs are sufficient to render the mature TGFB homodimer
inactive, and removal of both the LAPs and LTBP, or modulation of their
interaction, is essential for TGFB function (review by Oklu and Hesketh,
2000).

CLONING

Kanzaki et al. (1990) cloned a cDNA encoding human LTBP1. The structure
of human LTBP1 resembles fibrillin in that it includes 16 epidermal
growth factor-like repeats and 3 copies of a novel 8-cysteine motif.

Using PCR, Koski et al. (1999) detected variable expression of 2 major
splice variants of LTBP1 in human cell lines. The variants, LTBP1L and
LTBP1S, differed in 5-prime splicing and encode proteins with long and
short N-terminal ends, respectively.

In their review, Oklu and Hesketh (2000) described LTBP1 splice variants
common to both LTBP1L and LYBP1S: LTBP1-delta-42, which encodes an
isoform lacking EGF-like domain-12, and LTBP1-delta-53, which encodes a
protein that lacks the eighth cysteine of the first 8-cysteine domain.
LTBP1L has an additional splice variant, LTBP1-delta-55, which encodes a
protein lacking 2 putative N-glycosylation sites.

GENE STRUCTURE

By sequencing the 5-prime flanking regions of LTBP1L and LTBP1S, Koski
et al. (1999) determined that LTBP1L is transcribed independently from a
promoter upstream of the LTBP1S promoter. Both promoters lack TATA or
CAAT boxes, but they both have binding sites for AP1 (see 165160), GATA1
(305371), and OCT1 (POU2F1; 164175). Both promoters also have unique
regulatory elements, including SP1 (189906)-binding sites in the LTBP1L
promoter and an NF-kappa-B (see 164011)-binding site and a TGFB
inhibitory element (TIE) in the LTBP1S promoter.

MAPPING

Using a cDNA clone for LTBP1, Stenman et al. (1994) assigned the gene to
chromosome 2 by study of a panel of well-defined human/rodent somatic
cell hybrid lines and further localized the gene to 2p12-q22 by study of
3 hybrid lines containing partially overlapping fragments of chromosome
2.

605922	TITLE *605922 MYO-INOSITOL MONOPHOSPHATASE 2; IMPA2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Inositol phosphatases play a crucial role in the phosphatidylinositol
signaling pathway. Yoshikawa et al. (1997) cloned myo-inositol
monophosphatase-2 (IMPA2) from an EST located in the 18p11.2 region. The
deduced 288-amino acid protein shares approximately 54% identity with
IMPA1 (602064). It contains 2 motifs, designated A and B, that are
common to other inositol phosphatases and are thought to be important in
metal binding and in the catalytic activity of human IMP. Northern blot
analysis detected expression of a 1.5-kb IMPA2 transcript in many adult
and fetal tissues; in brain, the expression is substantially higher in
the subcortical regions, most prominently in the caudate.

GENE STRUCTURE

Yoshikawa et al. (2000) determined that the IMPA2 gene contains 8 exons
spanning approximately 27 kb of genomic DNA.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Yoshikawa et al. (1997) confirmed that the
IMPA2 gene is located on 18p, between the GNAL gene (139312) and marker
D18S71.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

The phosphatidylinositol pathway is thought to be modified by lithium, a
commonly prescribed medication in treating bipolar disorder (125480). A
susceptibility locus for bipolar disorder has been mapped to 18p. Based
on the mapping position of IMPA2 and its possible function, Yoshikawa et
al. (1997) suggested that it is a strong candidate gene for bipolar
disorder.

602123	TITLE *602123 CALCIUM/CALMODULIN-DEPENDENT PROTEIN KINASE II-GAMMA; CAMK2G
;;CaM KINASE II GAMMA SUBUNIT;;
CAMKG
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase II) is a
ubiquitous serine/threonine protein kinase that has been implicated in
diverse effects of hormones and neurotransmitters that utilize Ca(2+) as
a second messenger. The enzyme is an oligomeric protein composed of
distinct but related subunits, alpha (114078), beta (607707), gamma, and
delta (607708), each encoded by a separate gene. Each subunit has
alternatively spliced variants.

CLONING

Breen and Ashcroft (1997) cloned and sequenced a novel CaM kinase
II-gamma cDNA from human islet cell RNA. This isoform, designated
gamma-SRP by the authors, encodes a truncated gamma CaM kinase II in
which the 3-prime end consists of 804 basepairs of the human SRP72 gene
(602122).

Tombes and Krystal (1997) identified a number of CAMKG variants
expressed by neuronal cells. Two variants were consistently expressed in
nonneuronal cell lines, and another was preferentially expressed in
tumor cells.

MAPPING

Using somatic cell hybrid analysis and fluorescence in situ
hybridization, Li et al. (1994) mapped the CAMK2G gene to human
chromosome 10q22. Ahmed et al. (2001) stated that CAMK2G is 1 of 3 genes
that are nested in the introns of PCDH15 (605514).

GENE FUNCTION

In mouse cardiomyocytes, Zhu et al. (2003) demonstrated that
beta-1-adrenergic receptor (ADRB1; 109630)-induced apoptosis was
resistant to inhibition of PKA (see 176911). Rather, the Adrb1
proapoptotic effect was associated with non-Pka-dependent increases in
intracellular Ca(2+) and Camk2 activity. Blocking the L-type Ca(2+)
channel (see 114205), buffering intracellular Ca(2+), or inhibiting
Camk2 activity fully protected cardiomyocytes against Adrb1-induced
apoptosis; overexpressing the c splice variant of Camk2d markedly
exaggerated the Adrb1 apoptotic effect. Zhu et al. (2003) concluded that
CAMK2 constitutes a PKA-independent linkage of ADRB1 stimulation to
cardiomyocyte apoptosis.

Among 304 Swiss individuals tested and genotyped, de Quervain and
Papassotiropoulos (2006) found a significant association (p = 0.00008)
between short-term episodic memory performance and genetic variations in
a 7-gene cluster consisting of the ADCY8 (103070), PRKACG (176893),
CAMK2G, GRIN2A (138253), GRIN2B (138252), GRM3 (601115), and PRKCA
(176960) genes, all of which have well-established molecular and
biologic functions in animal memory. Functional MRI studies in an
independent set of 32 individuals with similar memory performance showed
a correlation between activation in memory-related brain regions,
including the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus, and genetic
variability in the 7-gene cluster. De Quervain and Papassotiropoulos
(2006) concluded that these 7 genes encode proteins of the memory
formation signaling cascade that are important for human memory
function.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

For discussion of mutation in the CAMK2G gene as a possible cause of an
intellectual disability phenotype, see 602123.0001.

ANIMAL MODEL

To study the role of CaMKII in T cells, Bui et al. (2000) generated
transgenic mice expressing a partially calcium-independent mutant form
of CAMKG (thr287 to asp). The size of the thymus was increased 1.5- to
2-fold in these mice, at least in part due to an increase in the life
span of double-positive thymocytes. There was an increase in the number
of T cells in the secondary lymphoid organs that had acquired an
antigen-dependent memory phenotype. These T cells were bona fide memory
cells as assessed by a variety of criteria. In addition, T cells from
wildtype mice acquired calcium-independent CaMKII activity after several
rounds of antigen-stimulated division. The authors proposed that CaMKII
controls a distinct process of activation-induced cellular
differentiation.

Using gene targeting, Zhang et al. (2005) developed a mouse model of
cardiac Camk2 inhibition and demonstrated substantial prevention of
maladaptive remodeling from excessive beta-adrenergic receptor
stimulation and myocardial infarction, and induction of balanced changes
in excitation-contraction coupling that preserved baseline and
beta-adrenergic receptor-stimulated physiologic increases in cardiac
function. Zhang et al. (2005) concluded that CAMK2 is a determinant of
clinically important heart disease phenotypes.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
VARIANT OF UNKNOWN SIGNIFICANCE
CAMK2G, ARG292PRO

This variant is classified as a variant of unknown significance because
its contribution to intellectual disability has not been confirmed.

In a boy with severe intellectual disability with self mutilation,
myopia, strabismus, mitochondrial dysfunction without mitochondrial gene
defects, short stature, flat face with narrow forehead, long palpebral
fissures, arched eyebrows, sacral dimple, short hands, brachydactyly,
and short feet, de Ligt et al. (2012) identified a de novo heterozygous
875G-C transversion resulting in an arg29-to-pro (R29P) substitution.
The patient had normal array and MLL2 testing.

604099	TITLE *604099 GLUTAMATE RECEPTOR, METABOTROPIC, 2; GRM2
;;MGLUR2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

L-glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the central
nervous system and activates both ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate
receptors (mGluRs). The mGluRs, which are G protein-coupled receptors,
have been divided into 3 groups on the basis of sequence homology,
putative signal transduction mechanisms, and pharmacologic properties.
Group II, which includes mGluR2 and mGluR3 (601115), and group III
mGluRs are linked to the inhibition of the cyclic AMP cascade, but
differ in their agonist selectivities.

CLONING

By screening human hippocampus and fetal brain libraries with rat mGluR2
cDNAs, Flor et al. (1995) isolated human mGluR2 cDNAs. Like other mGluRs
and G protein-coupled receptors, the predicted 872-amino acid human
mGluR2 protein contains a putative N-terminal signal sequence and 7
transmembrane domains. Human and rat mGluR2 are 97% identical on the
amino acid level. Northern blot analysis revealed that the human mGluR2
gene was expressed as a major transcript of approximately 3.5 kb and as
minor transcripts of approximately 5 and 7 kb in all tissues of the
adult central nervous system tested. When expressed in mammalian cells,
rat and human mGluR2 exhibited similar pharmacologic properties.

Tanabe et al. (1992) cloned rat brain cDNAs encoding mGluR2, mGluR3, and
mGluR4 (604100).

GENE FUNCTION

Poulopoulou et al. (2005) found significantly decreased GRM2 mRNA levels
in T lymphocytes of 20 patients with sporadic amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis (ALS; 105400) compared to healthy controls and patients with
other neurologic disorders. The authors suggested that decreased levels
of GRM2 may play a role in glutamate excitotoxicity that has been
postulated in ALS disease pathogenesis.

Metabotropic glutamate receptor-dependent long-term depression in the
ventral tegmental area efficiently reverses cocaine-induced
strengthening of excitatory inputs onto dopamine neurons. Mameli et al.
(2007) showed that metabotropic glutamate receptor long-term depression
is expressed by an exchange of GluR2-lacking AMPA receptors for
GluR2-containing receptors with a lower single-channel conductance. The
synaptic insertion of GluR2 depends on de novo protein synthesis via
rapid mRNA translation of GluR2. Mameli et al. (2007) concluded that
regulated synthesis of GluR2 in the ventral tegmental area is required
to reverse cocaine-induced synaptic plasticity.

Gonzalez-Maeso et al. (2008) demonstrated that mGluR2 interacts through
specific transmembrane helix domains with HTR2A (182135), a member of an
unrelated G protein-coupled receptor family, to form functional
complexes in brain cortex. The serotonin HTR2A receptor-mGluR2 complex
triggers unique cellular responses when targeted by hallucinogenic
drugs, and activation of mGluR2 abolishes hallucinogen-specific
signaling and behavioral responses. In postmortem schizophrenic human
brain from untreated subjects, HTR2A is upregulated and mGluR2 is
downregulated, a pattern that could predispose to psychosis.
Gonzalez-Maeso et al. (2008) concluded that the HTR2A-mGluR2 complex may
be involved in the altered cortical processes of schizophrenia.

GENE STRUCTURE

Marti et al. (2002) demonstrated that the GRM2 gene contains 5 exons,
with sizes ranging from 74 to 1,076 bp.

MAPPING

By analysis of a somatic cell hybrid panel, Flor et al. (1995) mapped
the human GRM2 gene to chromosome 3. By radiation hybrid analysis, Marti
et al. (2002) sublocalized the GRM2 gene to 3p21.2-p21.1.

ANIMAL MODEL

The mGluR2 gene is expressed in the presynaptic elements of hippocampal
mossy fiber-CA3 synapses. Yokoi et al. (1996) found that knockout mice
deficient in mGluR2 lacked long-term depression (LTD) induced by
low-frequency stimulation at hippocampal mossy fiber-CA3 synapses.
However, the mutant mice performed normally in water maze learning
tasks. The authors concluded that the presynaptic mGluR2 is essential
for inducing LTD at the mossy fiber-CA3 synapses, but that this
hippocampal LTD may not be required for spatial learning.

Morishima et al. (2005) generated mGluR2 -/- mice and observed a
significant increase in locomotor sensitization and conditioned place
preference in association with repeated cocaine administration compared
to their wildtype littermates. In vivo microdialysis analysis after
cocaine administration revealed increased extracellular levels of
dopamine and a markedly changed response pattern of glutamate release in
the nucleus accumbens of mGluR2-null mice. The null mice also exhibited
impaired motor coordination in the accelerating rota-rod test and
hyperlocomotion in novel environmental and stressful conditions.
Morishima et al. (2005) concluded that mGluR2 contributes to behavioral
responses implicated in reinforcement and addiction to cocaine, and
plays a pivotal role in synaptic regulation of glutamatergic
transmission in the neural network.

609619	TITLE *609619 GOLGI AUTOANTIGEN, GOLGIN SUBFAMILY A, 8B; GOLGA8B
;;GOLGIN 67;;
KIAA0855
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database analysis with the sequence of the Golgi complex autoantigen
golgin-95/golgin-130 (GOLGA2; 602580) as probe, Eystathioy et al. (2000)
identified a novel Golgi autoantigen, golgin-67. Using overlapping cDNAs
and RACE, Eystathioy et al. (2000) constructed a full-length clone
encoding a 459-amino acid protein with numerous alpha-helical
coiled-coils. Golgin-67 shares 4 regions with sequence identity to
golgin-95, ranging between 42% and 60%. Golgin-67 is identical to the
KIAA0855 clone identified by Nagase et al. (1998) from a human brain
cDNA library.

Of 84 human anti-Golgi sera, Eystathioy et al. (2000) identified 5 (6%)
containing autoantibodies to golgin-67. Two of these sera, from patients
with Sjogren syndrome (270150) and rheumatoid arthritis (180300), bound
to a protein of 67 kD on Western blots. Anti-golgin-67 human sera and
affinity purified rabbit antibody to the recombinant protein gave
predominant Golgi staining.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the GOLGA8B
gene to chromosome 15 (TMAP RH48788).

604921	TITLE *604921 MITOGEN-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE KINASE KINASE KINASE 3; MAP4K3
;;MAPKKKK3;;
GERMINAL CENTER KINASE-LIKE KINASE; GLK;;
RAB8-INTERACTING PROTEIN-LIKE 1, FORMERLY; RAB8IPL1, FORMERLY
DESCRIPTION Protein kinases (PKs) are critical to the regulation of many cellular
processes, including growth factor response, cytoskeletal changes, gene
expression, and metabolism. Mitogen-activated PKs (MAPKs) are a family
of serine/threonine PKs involved in highly conserved cascades that
control these processes. MAPKs are activated by MAPK kinases (MAP2Ks),
which are activated by MAP2K kinases (MAP3Ks), which are activated by
MAP3K kinases (MAP4Ks). For example, ERK2 (MAPK1; 176948) is activated
by phosphorylation of ser/thr residues by its upstream kinase, MEK1
(MAP2K1; 176872), which is itself activated by MEKK1 (MAP3K1; 600982).
Another MAPK, JNK (MAPK8; 601158), is predominantly activated in
response to stress. JNK expression is also regulated by upstream kinases
(e.g., MAP2K4; 601335), which are activated by MAP3Ks.

By screening a skeletal muscle cDNA library using degenerate PCR primers
based on conserved sequences of catalytic domains of ser/thr PKs, Diener
et al. (1997) identified a cDNA encoding MAP4K3, which they called
'germinal center kinase-like kinase,' or GLK. Sequence analysis showed
that the 885-amino acid MAP4K3 protein contains an N-terminal catalytic
domain, 2 PEST (pro, glu, ser, thr) motifs, and 3 proline-rich regions.
MAP4K3 shares 57% amino acid identity with germinal center kinase (GCK,
or MAP4K2; 603166). Northern blot analysis detected a single 4.2-kb
MAP4K3 transcript in all tissues tested, namely placenta, pancreas,
kidney, skeletal muscle, heart, brain, lung, and liver. Western blot
analysis determined that MAP4K3 is expressed as a 100-kD protein.
Functional analysis showed that MAP4K3 has kinase activity and that it
activates JNK but not MAPK1, MAPK3 (601795), or MAPK14 (600289) through
the activation of MAP3K1 and MAP2K4. Endogenous MAP4K3 kinase activity
could be stimulated by exposure to ultraviolet radiation or to tumor
necrosis factor (TNF; 191160).

601250	TITLE *601250 PEPTIDE METHIONINE SULFOXIDE REDUCTASE; MSRA
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Oxidation of methionine residues by reactive oxygen in proteins leads to
the formation of methionine sulfoxide, which can impair protein
function. Both S and R stereoisomers of methionine sulfoxides are
formed, and these are reduced by MSRA (EC 1.8.4.6) and MSRB (see SEPX1;
606216), respectively (summary by Schallreuter et al., 2006).

CLONING

Moskovitz et al. (1996) cloned a bovine cDNA that encodes a 255-amino
acid putative protein that has high similarity to MsrA (also called
pmsR) of E. coli (61% identity), and in general the characteristics of
the 2 enzymes are similar. MSRA mRNA is highly expressed in rat and
human kidney, but to a lesser extent in other rat tissues. The highest
specific activity of the mammalian MSRA enzyme was found in cell-free
extracts prepared from rat kidney and human neutrophils. Neutrophils and
macrophages are known to produce reactive oxygen species during a
respiratory burst that kill invading bacteria during phagocytosis. It is
suggested that MSRA functions to repair oxidative damage to proteins
that may occur during oxidative bursts or other situations where
reactive oxygen radicals exist. Moskovitz et al. (1996) used
immunocytochemistry to detect expression of MSRA in situ. They detected
MSRA in all rat tissues examined, but it was specifically localized to
renal medulla and retinal pigmented epithelial cells, and it was
prominent in neurons and throughout the nervous system. In addition,
blood and alveolar macrophages showed high expression of the enzyme.

Using immunohistochemical analysis and electron microscopy, Hansel et
al. (2002) detected Msra in the mitochondrial matrix of mouse and rat
liver.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Lei et al. (2007) mapped the MSRA gene to
chromosome 8p23.1.

Moskovitz et al. (1996) mapped the MSRA gene to the central region of
mouse chromosome 14, in a region of syntenic homology with human
chromosomes 13 and 8p21.

GENE FUNCTION

Hansel et al. (2002) determined that the first 23 amino acids of human
MSRA constitute a mitochondrial targeting signal. Removal of the signal
sequence did not alter MSRA activity against a synthetic peptide
containing methionine sulfoxide. Mutation of arg6, arg7, or arg22 or
disturbance of a hydrophobic stretch within the mitochondrial signal
sequence disturbed or prevented mitochondrial targeting of MSRA.

Schallreuter et al. (2006) noted that MSRA and MSRB require coupling to
the NADPH/thioredoxin reductase (see 601112)/thioredoxin (see 187700)
electron donor system for enzymatic activity. Using immunohistochemical
analysis, they found coexpression of MSRA, MSRB, and thioredoxin
reductase in human melanocytes. Western blot analysis confirmed
coexpression of MSRA and MSRB in human primary melanocytes. Biochemical
analysis showed that both S- and R-diasteriomers of methionine sulfoxide
were reduced in nuclear and cytosolic fractions of human epidermal
melanocytes.

By microarray analysis, Lei et al. (2007) identified MSRA among 10 genes
that were significantly downregulated in human hepatocellular carcinomas
(HCCs). Real-time PCR and Western blot analyses showed that MSRA mRNA
and protein were significantly decreased in HCCs with metastasis
compared with those without metastasis. Transfection of MSRA reduced
colony formation and the invasiveness of an HCC cell line.

ANIMAL MODEL

Oxidation of proteins by reactive oxygen species is associated with
aging, oxidative stress, and many diseases. Although free and
protein-bound methionine residues are particularly sensitive to
oxidation to methionine sulfoxide derivatives, these oxidations are
readily repaired by the action of methionine sulfoxide reductase. To
gain a better understanding of the biologic roles of MSRA in metabolism,
Moskovitz et al. (2001) created a strain of mouse that lacks the Msra
gene. Compared with the wildtype, this mutant exhibited enhanced
sensitivity to oxidative stress (exposure to 100% oxygen); had a shorter
life span under both normal and hyperoxic conditions; developed an
atypical (tip-toe) walking pattern after 6 months of age; accumulated
higher tissue levels of oxidized protein (carbonyl derivatives) under
oxidative stress; and was less able to upregulate expression of
thioredoxin reductase (see 601112) under oxidative stress. The
observations were taken to indicate that methionine sulfoxide reductase
plays an important role in aging and neurologic disorders.

Cumulative oxidative damage to cell constituents is thought to
contribute to aging and age-related diseases. MSRA catalyzes the repair
of oxidized methionine in proteins by reducing methionine sulfoxide back
to methionine. Ruan et al. (2002) reported that overexpression of the
msrA gene predominantly in the nervous system markedly extended the life
span of the fruit fly Drosophila. The MSRA transgenic animals were more
resistant to paraquat-induced oxidative stress, and the onset of
senescence-induced decline in the general activity level and
reproductive capacity was delayed markedly. These results suggested that
oxidative damage is an important determinant of life span and that MSRA
may be important in increasing the life span in other organisms,
including humans.

603251	TITLE *603251 CYCLIN-DEPENDENT KINASE 9; CDK9
;;PITALRE;;
CTK1, YEAST, HOMOLOG OF; CTK1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Positive transcription factor b (P-TEFb) controls the elongation phase
of transcription by RNA polymerase II (see POLR2A; 180660). P-TEFb is a
heterodimer of CDK9 and 1 of 4 cyclin partners, cyclin T1 (CCNT1;
143055), cyclin K (CCNK; 603544), or cyclin T2a or T2b, which are
isoforms of CCNT2 (603862) (Shore et al., 2003).

CLONING

To identify CDC2 (116940) family members, Grana et al. (1994) performed
PCR on a mouse embryonic cDNA library using degenerate oligonucleotides
based on regions conserved among CDC2-related proteins. They used a
resulting PCR product to screen a human cDNA library and isolated a CDK9
cDNA. The predicted 372-amino acid protein contains the 11 conserved
regions characteristic of the protein kinase catalytic domain, a
putative nuclear localization signal, and a putative ATP-binding site.
The authors called the protein PITALRE because it contains a
pro-ile-thr-ala-leu-arg-glu motif similar to the PSTAIRE motif found in
prototypic CDC2 kinases. CDK9 shares 41 to 43% amino acid sequence
identity with CDC2, CDK2 (116953), CDK3 (123828), and CDK5 (123831).
Subcellular fractionation and Western blot analyses demonstrated that
CDK9 has a molecular mass of 43 kD and is located primarily in the
nucleus. Northern blot analysis indicated that CDK9 was expressed as
2.8- and 3.2-kb mRNAs in all tissues tested, with the highest levels in
liver and placenta.

Independently, Best et al. (1995) cloned human CDK9 cDNAs and designated
the gene C-2k.

By RT-PCR of HeLa cell total RNA, Shore et al. (2003) cloned a splice
variant of CDK9 that originates from an upstream promoter region. The
deduced protein, CDK9-55, has a calculated molecular mass of 53.4 kD and
contains a 117-amino acid N-terminal extension with a proline-rich
region and a glycine-rich region. Using antibodies specific to the
N-terminal extension, Shore et al. (2003) showed that CDK9-55 had an
apparent molecular mass of 55 kD. The ratio of CDK9-55 to the shorter
CDK9 isoform, CDK9-42, differed between HeLa cell nuclear extracts and
mouse fibroblasts, but CDK9-42 was the predominant isoform in both.

GENE FUNCTION

Grana et al. (1994) found that 3 cellular proteins coimmunoprecipitated
with CDK9, and CDK9 immunocomplexes had an RB1 (614041) kinase activity.

Garriga et al. (1996) found that monomeric CDK9, in contrast to other
CDKs, is active. The association of CDK9 with other proteins modulates
its activity and/or its ability to recognize substrates in vivo.

Yang et al. (2001) identified 7SK snRNA (606515) as a specific
P-TEFb-associated factor. 7SK inhibits general and human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 Tat-specific transcriptional activities
of P-TEFb in vivo and in vitro by inhibiting the kinase activity of CDK9
and preventing recruitment of P-TEFb to the HIV-1 promoter. 7SK is
efficiently dissociated from P-TEFb (the CDK9/cyclin T1 heterodimer) by
treatment of cells with ultraviolet irradiation and actinomycin D. As
these 2 agents have been shown to enhance significantly HIV-1
transcription and phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II, Yang et al.
(2001) concluded that their data provide a mechanistic explanation for
this stimulatory effect. Yang et al. (2001) further suggested that the
7SK/P-TEFb interaction may serve as a principal control point for the
induction of cellular and HIV-1 viral gene expression during
stress-related responses. The study demonstrated the involvement of an
snRNA in controlling the activity of CDK/cyclin kinase.

Nguyen et al. (2001) independently showed that in human HeLa cells more
than half of the P-TEFb is sequestered in larger complexes that also
contain 7SK RNA. P-TEFb and 7SK associate in a specific and reversible
manner. In contrast to the smaller P-TEFb complexes, which have a high
kinase activity, the large 7SK/P-TEFb complexes show very weak kinase
activity. Inhibition of cellular transcription by chemical agents or
ultraviolet irradiation triggers complete disruption of the P-TEFb/7SK
complex, and enhances CDK9 activity. Nguyen et al. (2001) concluded that
transcription-dependent interaction of P-TEFb with 7SK may therefore
contribute to an important feedback loop modulating the activity of RNA
Pol II.

Fong and Zhou (2001) demonstrated that splicing factors function
directly to promote transcriptional elongation. The spliceosomal U small
nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) interact with human transcription
elongation factor TAT-SF1 (300346) and strongly stimulate polymerase
elongation when directed to an intron-free HIV-1 template. Fong and Zhou
(2001) suggested that this effect is likely to be mediated through the
binding of TAT-SF1 to elongation factor P-TEFb. Inclusion of splicing
signals in the nascent transcript further stimulates transcription,
supporting the notion that the recruitment of U snRNPs near the
elongating polymerase is important for transcription. Because the
TAT-SF1--U snRNP complex also stimulates splicing in vitro, Fong and
Zhou (2001) proposed that it may serve as a dual-function factor to
couple transcription and splicing and to facilitate their reciprocal
activation.

By immunoprecipitation analysis, Shore et al. (2003) showed that CDK9-55
immunoprecipitated with cyclin T1, cyclin T2a, and cyclin T2b from HeLa
cell nuclear extracts. CDK9-55 could phosphorylate the C-terminal domain
of Drosophila Polr2a. Differential extraction of size-fractionated HeLa
cell P-TEFb complexes showed that, like CDK9-42, CDK9-55 associated with
high molecular mass complexes containing 7SK RNA and with low molecular
mass complexes lacking 7SK RNA. Western blot analysis showed that
untreated human macrophages expressed more CDK9-55 than CDK9-42, but
macrophages activated by lipopolysaccharide or infected with HIV
expressed more CDK9-42 than CDK9-55.

Sano et al. (2004) found that 8 ventricle samples from patients with
heart failure due to dilated cardiomyopathy showed increased CDK9
activity against the C-terminal domain of POLR2A compared with controls.
Increased CDK7 activity was also present in a minority of patient
samples. Substantial hyperphosphorylation of endogenous POLR2A was more
frequent at the CDK9 site than the CDK7 site in failing hearts. Sano et
al. (2004) noted that cardiomyocyte-restricted expression of cyclin T1
in mice maintains Cdk9 activity at its elevated embryonic level. They
found that maintenance of Cdk9 in mouse hearts through cyclin T1
expression resulted in myocyte enlargement and selective suppression of
Pgc1 (PPARGC1A; 604517), a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis
and function, leading to mitochondrial defects, enhanced myocyte
apoptosis, predisposition to heart failure, and early death.

Jang et al. (2005) found that epitope-tagged mouse Brd4 (608749)
interacted with cyclin T1 and CDK9 in P-TEFb complexes contained in HeLa
cell nuclear extracts. The bromodomain of Brd4 was required for the
interaction. Brd4 overexpression increased P-TEFb-dependent
phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II and
stimulated transcription from a reporter plasmid driven by an HIV-1
promoter. Conversely, reduced Brd4 expression in mouse fibroblasts by
small interfering RNA reduced RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain
phosphorylation and transcription. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays
indicated that recruitment of P-TEFb to a promoter was dependent on Brd4
and was enhanced by increased chromatin acetylation.

About half of cellular P-TEFb exists in an inactive complex with 7SK and
the HEXIM1 protein (607328). Yang et al. (2005) demonstrated that the
remaining half associated with BRD4. In stress-induced HeLa cells,
7SK/HEXIM1-bound P-TEFb was converted into the BRD4-associated form. The
association of P-TEFb with BRD4 was necessary to form the
transcriptionally active P-TEFb, to recruit P-TEFb to a promoter, and to
enable P-TEFb to contact the Mediator complex (see 602984). The P-TEFb
recruitment function of BRD4 could be substituted by that of HIV-1 Tat,
which recruited P-TEFb directly for activated HIV-1 transcription.

Rother and Strasser (2007) found that the yeast CDK9 homolog, Ctk1,
functioned in translation by enhancing decoding fidelity. Ctk1
associated with translating ribosomes in vivo and was needed for
efficient translation. Ctk1 phosphorylated the small ribosomal subunit
Rps2 (603624), and absence of Rps2 phosphorylation led to defects in
translation elongation due to increased frequency of miscoding.

Wagner et al. (2008) found that injection of microRNA miR1 (see MIRN1-1;
609326) into fertilized mouse oocytes resulted in the early appearance
of cardiac hypertrophy. Abnormal growth of the ventricular wall in
experimental mice was associated with a significant increase in the
level of Cdk9 mRNA, an miR1 target. Cdk9 protein content was even more
elevated, and there was increased phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II.
miR1 expression was not significantly changed in experimental mice, and
there was no significant change in expression of other miR1 targets.
Similar cardiac hypertrophy and biochemical changes were found in
embryos developed from fertilized mouse oocytes that had been
microinjected with 20-nucleotide sequences randomly chosen from the Cdk9
coding sequence.

The RNA polymerase II largest subunit, POLR2A (180660), contains a
C-terminal domain (CTD) with up to 52
Tyr(1)-Ser(2)-Pro(3)-Thr(4)-Ser(5)-Pro(6)-Ser(7) consensus repeats.
Serines 2, 5, and 7 are known to be phosphorylated, and these
modifications help to orchestrate the interplay between transcription
and processing of mRNA precursors. Hsin et al. (2011) provided evidence
that phosphorylation of CTD Thr(4) residues is required specifically for
histone mRNA 3-prime end processing, functioning to facilitate
recruitment of 3-prime processing factors to histone genes. Like Ser(2),
Thr(4) phosphorylation requires the CTD kinase CDK9 and is
evolutionarily conserved from yeast to human. Hsin et al. (2011)
concluded that their data illustrated how a CTD modification can play a
highly specific role in facilitating efficient gene expression.

GENE STRUCTURE

Liu and Rice (2000) determined that the CDK9 gene contains 7 exons.
RNase protection and primer extension analyses indicated that the major
transcription site for the CDK9 gene is at nucleotide -79. Further
promoter analysis suggested that the region between nucleotides -219 and
-89 contains other important regulatory elements.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Tahirov et al. (2010) described the crystal structure of the HIV
Tat-P-TEFb complex, which is composed of HIV-1 Tat, human CDK9, and
human cyclin T1 (CCTN1; 143055). Tat adopts a structure complementary to
the surface of P-TEFb and makes extensive contacts, mainly with the
cyclin T1 subunit of P-TEFb, but also with the T-loop of the CDK9
subunit. The structure provides a plausible explanation for the
tolerance of Tat to sequence variations at certain sites. Importantly,
Tat induces significant conformational changes in P-TEFb.

MAPPING

By analysis of somatic cell hybrids, Bullrich et al. (1995) mapped the
CDK9 gene to 9q34.1, a region associated with abnormalities and allelic
losses in several malignancies.

609206	TITLE *609206 EUKARYOTIC TRANSLATION ELONGATION FACTOR 1, EPSILON-1; EEF1E1
;;ELONGATION FACTOR p18
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing cDNAs randomly selected from a cDNA library derived from
human umbilical cord CD34 (142230)-positive cells, Mao et al. (1998)
obtained a full-length cDNA encoding EEF1E1. The deduced 174-amino acid
protein is a homolog of the rodent elongation factor p18.

GENE FUNCTION

Park et al. (2005) found that human p18 was induced and translocated to
the nucleus in response to DNA damage. Expression of p18 resulted in
elevated p53 (191170) levels, while p18 depletion blocked p53 induction.
p18 interacted directly with ATM (607585) and ATR (601215) in response
to DNA damage. ATM activity was dependent on the level of p18,
suggesting that p18 is required for activation of ATM. RT-PCR showed
that p18 expression was low in several different human cancer cell lines
and tissues. These results, as well as findings in p18 mutant mice,
suggested that p18 is a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor and a key
factor for ATM/ATR-mediated p53 activation.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Mao et al. (1998) mapped the EEF1E1 gene
to chromosome 6p25.1-p23.

ANIMAL MODEL

Park et al. (2005) found that inactivation of both p18 alleles in mice
caused embryonic lethality, whereas heterozygous mice showed high
susceptibility to spontaneous tumors.

614958	TITLE *614958 SCHLAFEN FAMILY, MEMBER 14; SLFN14
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The Schlafen (SFLN) family contains 9 mouse and 6 human genes, including
SLFN14, that encode proteins with a conserved N terminus containing a
putative AAA ATPase domain. Longer SLFN proteins have C-terminal motifs
resembling DNA/RNA helicase domains. Studies in mouse have implicated
SLFN proteins in regulation of cell growth and T-cell development
(summary by Geserick et al. (2004) and Li et al. (2012)).

MAPPING

Gross (2012) mapped the SLFN14 gene to chromosome 17q12 based on an
alignment of the SLFN14 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC140847) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

Bustos et al. (2009) found that the SLFN genes are clustered within the
same orthologous region flanked by the UNC45 (UNC45B; 611220) and PEX12
(601758) genes in all mammalian genomes examined. The human and mouse
SLFN clusters are located on chromosomes 17 and 11, respectively.

EVOLUTION

Bustos et al. (2009) used genomic and phylogenetic studies to
investigate the evolution and role of the SLFN gene family. They found
that the SLFN family is widely distributed in mammals, with 4 major
clades that underwent lineage-specific expansions or contractions in
various orders, including primates and rodents. Bustos et al. (2009)
also identified SLFN family members in Chondrichthyes and Amphibia. They
found evidence that positive selection has acted on many SLFN genes. A
member of the SLFN family was horizontally transferred from mouse to
orthopoxviruses, where the authors hypothesized it plays a role in
allowing the virus to survive host defense mechanisms. The viral SLFN
sequences are evolving under purifying selection, indicating their
functional relevance.

Van Zuylen et al. (2011) noted that only 2 SLFN family members, SLFN5
(614952) and SLFN14, have direct orthologs in mouse and human,
consistent with rapid evolution of the SLFN family across mammalian
species. Human SLFN12 (614956) and SLFN12L (614957) have 4 orthologs in
mice (Slfn1, Slfn2, Slfn3, and Slfn4), and human SLFN11 (614953) and
SLFN13 (614957) have 3 orthologs in mice (Slfn8, Slfn9, and Slfn10).

607860	TITLE *607860 YY1 ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 1; YY1AP1
;;YY1-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN; YAP;;
HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 2; HCCA2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By differential display PCR of normal hepatic tissue and hepatocellular
carcinomas, followed by screening a placenta cDNA library, Wang et al.
(2001) cloned YY1AP1, which they called HCCA2. The deduced 467-amino
acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 50.65 kD. HCCA2 contains
2 SH3-binding domains, 2 N-glycosylation sites, 6 N-myristoylation
sites, and numerous phosphorylation sites, but it does not have a
transmembrane domain, signal peptide, or targeting sequences. Northern
blot analysis detected 1.8- and 2.5-kb transcripts in all adult tissues
examined except liver. Expression was also detected in fetal liver,
lung, brain, and spleen. Western blot analysis of transfected embryonic
kidney fibroblasts detected HCCA2 at an apparent molecular mass of about
50 kD. Immunohistochemical staining showed that HCCA2 protein was
localized in the cytoplasm of liver cancer tissues, and it was not found
in surrounding nontumor hepatocytes.

Kuryshev et al. (2006) determined that YY1AP1 was formed by fusion of
the 5-prime region of the ASH1L gene (607999) and the 3-prime region of
the GON4L gene (610393) during a tandem segmental duplication on
chromosome 1. YY1AP1 contains the partial promoter and untranslated
first exon of ASH1L and coding exons 13 to 21 of GON4L. The 3-prime
region of YY1AP1 originated from a long terminal repeat of an endogenous
retrovirus, known as the MER51A repeat, that was inserted into exon 21
of GON4L after the duplication. The deduced YY1AP1 protein contains 750
amino acids, 748 of which correspond to amino acids 590 to 1,337 of the
GON4L protein. The last 2 C-terminal residues of YY1AP1 come from the
long terminal repeat of MER51A. RT-PCR detected ubiquitous expression of
YY1AP1, with highest levels in testis and skeletal muscle.

GENE FUNCTION

Wang et al. (2001) determined that HCCA2 was not expressed in normal
adult liver tissue, but it was expressed in 79% of hepatocellular
carcinomas tested. HCCA2 expression was associated with invasion of the
tumor capsule.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Kuryshev et al. (2006) mapped the YY1AP1
gene to chromosome 1q22.

608057	TITLE *608057 DEOXYRIBONUCLEASE II BETA; DNASE2B
;;DNase II-BETA;;
DNASE2-LIKE ACID DNase; DLAD
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

DLAD is a cation-independent acid endonuclease that shares homology with
deoxyribonuclease II (DNASE2; 126350). Unlike DNASE2, however, DLAD
shows a restricted tissue distribution.

CLONING

By searching an EST database for sequences sharing similarity with
DNASE2, followed by 3-prime RACE of salivary gland RNA, Krieser et al.
(2001) cloned full-length DLAD, which they called DNase II-beta. The
deduced 357-amino acid protein contains an N-terminal signal sequence, a
signal peptide cleavage site, and a conserved active site. It shares 37%
amino acid identity with DNASE2. Northern blot analysis of salivary
gland detected a 2.1-kb transcript. Expression array analysis detected
highest expression in salivary gland, followed by lung, prostate, and
lymph node. Weak expression was detected in trachea and testis, and no
expression was detected in any other tissue examined. Northern blot
analysis of mouse tissues detected expression of a 1.6-kb Dlad
transcript only in liver. By 5-prime RACE of lymphoid and lung cell line
RNA, Krieser et al. (2001) identified a DLAD sequence containing exon 1
of the inactive UOX pseudogene (191540), which is located in tandem with
DLAD on chromosome 1, within the 5-prime untranslated region. By
database analysis, they found DLAD homologs in all mammals examined and
in C. elegans and Drosophila.

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to mouse Dlad,
followed by 5-prime and 3-prime RACE of lung cDNA, Shiokawa and Tanuma
(2001) cloned DLAD. The deduced protein contains 153 amino acids and
includes a conserved active site histidine. Northern blot analysis of
several tissues detected a 1.1-kb transcript only in lung. By genomic
sequence analysis and PCR, Shiokawa and Tanuma (2001) identified a
longer DLAD variant that encodes a deduced 361-amino acid protein with 5
putative N-glycosylation sites. The longer DLAD sequence shares 63.2%
and 65.1% amino acid identity with mouse and rat Dlad, respectively.
Shiokawa and Tanuma (2001) determined that the lung-specific DLAD mRNA
is transcribed from intron 2 through exon 6.

GENE FUNCTION

Krieser et al. (2001) detected DNase activity at acidic pH in human
saliva following immunodepletion of DNASE2. They attributed the residual
activity to DLAD.

Shiokawa and Tanuma (2001) characterized affinity-purified recombinant
DLAD. They observed endonuclease activity over a broad pH range, with
maximum activity at pH 4.8 to 5.6. The activity was independent of
divalent cations and chelating agents.

Nishimoto et al. (2003) found that DLAD mRNA is highly expressed in the
mouse lens, with expression level in the lens about 10 times higher than
that in the liver. DLAD mRNA levels in the mouse lens were low at
embryonic day 14.5, but much increased at the late stage of mouse
embryogenesis. DLAD mRNA was detected in human lens cells from patients
with senile cataracts. An epithelial cell line established from human
lens also expressed a significant level of DLAD mRNA. Little expression
of DLAD mRNA was found in the other types of cell lines.

GENE STRUCTURE

Krieser et al. (2001) and Shiokawa and Tanuma (2001) determined that the
DLAD gene contains 6 exons and lies in a head-to-head orientation with
the inactive UOX pseudogene. Krieser et al. (2001) determined that the
DLAD gene spans about 16.3 kb, while Shiokawa and Tanuma (2001)
determined that it spans about 18 kb. Shiokawa and Tanuma (2001) found
that the promoter region of the mouse Dlad gene contains no canonical
TATA or CAAT boxes.

MAPPING

By FISH, Krieser et al. (2001) mapped the DLAD gene to chromosome
1p22.3.

ANIMAL MODEL

Nishimoto et al. (2003) generated Dlad-null mice by gene targeting.
Their targeting vector deleted exons 3 and 4, as confirmed by Southern
hybridization, Northern blot analysis, and RT-PCR. Dlad-null mice were
born at the expected mendelian frequency, showed no gross developmental
abnormality other than cataract, and were fertile. The eyeballs of
Dlad-null mice were of normal morphology, with well-differentiated
mature lens fiber cells. Mature lens fiber cells did not contain
endoplasmic reticulum or mitochondria; however, undigested DNA was
identified in the epithelial layer and the nucleus. Newborn Dlad-null
mice showed weak but recognizable cataract that was enhanced with age.
Nishimoto et al. (2003) concluded that DLAD is responsible for the
degradation of nuclear DNA during lens cell differentiation and that if
DNA is left undigested in the lens, it causes cataracts of the nucleus
lentis, blocking the light path.

607187	TITLE *607187 ST3 BETA-GALACTOSIDE ALPHA-2,3-SIALYLTRANSFERASE 1; ST3GAL1
;;SIALYLTRANSFERASE 4A; SIAT4A;;
ST3O
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Cell type-specific expression of unique carbohydrate structures on cell
surface glycoproteins and glycolipids provides information relevant to
cell-cell interactions in developing and adult organisms.
Sialyltransferases, such as ST3GAL1, contribute to the diversity of
carbohydrate structures through their attachment of sialic acid in
various terminal positions on glycolipid and on glycoprotein (N-linked
and O-linked) carbohydrate groups (Kitagawa and Paulson, 1994).

CLONING

By PCR using degenerate primers based on a conserved sialyl motif and
screening of a placenta cDNA library, Kitagawa and Paulson (1994)
isolated a full-length cDNA encoding SIAT4A (EC 2.4.99.4), which they
called ST3O. The deduced 340-amino acid protein shares 86% identity with
porcine St3O. Northern blot analysis revealed ubiquitous expression of a
major 6-kb transcript, with highest expression in lung, liver, skeletal
muscle, kidney, and pancreas. Several smaller transcripts were detected
in other tissues.

Using the porcine Siat4a sequence as probe, Chang et al. (1995) cloned
SIAT4A from a human submaxillary gland cDNA library. The deduced SIAT4A
protein contains a type II transmembrane region and 2 sialyl motifs,
designate SM1 and SM2. Northern blot analysis confirmed ubiquitous
expression of SIAT4A, with highest expression in skeletal muscle.

Shang et al. (1999) cloned SIAT4A, which they called SIATFL, from a
fetal liver cDNA library. The deduced SIAT4A protein has a calculated
molecular mass of 38 kD and contains an N-terminal cytoplasmic domain, a
single type II transmembrane domain, a stem region, and a C-terminal
catalytic domain. Northern blot and analysis revealed a single
transcript of about 8 kb in several cancer cell lines and fetal tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

Kitagawa and Paulson (1994) expressed soluble truncation mutants of
human and porcine ST3O in COS-1 cells. Biochemical analysis revealed
conservation of function. ST3O was found to synthesize
NeuAc-alpha-2,3-Gal-beta-1,3-GalNAc, a structure common to many O-linked
oligosaccharides. The authors noted that ST3O differs from other
sialyltransferases in its ability to utilize glycolipid acceptor
substrates in vitro.

Shang et al. (1999) analyzed the sialyltransferase activity of soluble
SAIT4A expressed in COS-1 cells, bacteria, and yeast. Recombinant
protein expressed in COS-1 cells catalyzed the transfer of
fluorescent-labeled NeuAc from CMP-9-fluoresceinyl-AcNeu to
asialofetuin. No activity was detected with recombinant protein
expressed in E. coli or P. pastoris, suggesting that correct
glycosylation of the enzyme is directly related to enzymatic activity.

GENE STRUCTURE

Chang et al. (1995) determined that the SIAT4A gene contains 7 exons.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid analysis, Chang et al. (1995) mapped the SIAT4A
gene to chromosome 8.

OTHER FEATURES

Influenza viruses manifest species tropism, with avian viruses rarely
infecting and spreading between humans. Shinya et al. (2006) noted that
the distribution and prevalence of the influenza virus-binding
molecules, sialic acid linked to galactose by an alpha-2,3 linkage
(SA-alpha-2,3-Gal) or by an alpha-2,6 linkage (SA-alpha-2,6-Gal), in the
human airway were unknown. Using lectins specific for each molecule,
they showed that SA-alpha-2,6-Gal was dominant on epithelial cells of
the nasal mucosa, pharynx, trachea, and bronchi. In contrast,
SA-alpha-2,3-Gal was found on nonciliated cuboidal bronchiolar cells at
the junction of bronchioles and alveoli, as well as on alveolar cells,
including alveolar type II cells, and cells in the alveolar wall. Shinya
et al. (2006) found that human-derived viruses preferentially bound
epithelial cells expressing SA-alpha-2,6-Gal, whereas avian viruses
preferentially interacted with alveolar cells expressing
SA-alpha-2,3-Gal. They noted that an H5N1 influenza virus isolated from
a human patient bound to both bronchial and alveolar cells. The results
indicated that H5N1 virus strains preferentially recognizing
SA-alpha-2,3-Gal can be transmitted from birds to humans, but they can
replicate efficiently only in alveolar cells. Thus, transmission via
cells in the upper respiratory tract may be inefficient in the absence
of an ability to recognize SA-alpha-2,6-Gal. Shinya et al. (2006)
concluded that mutations in the viral hemagglutinin molecule would be
necessary to confer SA-alpha-2,6-Gal-binding ability on H5N1 avian
viruses, and that amino acid substitutions in other viral proteins,
including PB2, may also be required to confer potential for a human
pandemic.

Nicholls et al. (2007) found that ex vivo cultures of human
nasopharyngeal, adenoid, and tonsillar tissues could be infected with
influenza A H5N1 viruses in spite of the lack of viral receptors for
SA-alpha-2,3-Gal in the upper airway. They concluded that the increased
severity of H5N1 influenza cannot be explained purely on the basis of a
differential tropism of H5N1 to the lower respiratory tract.

600957	TITLE *600957 ANTI-MULLERIAN HORMONE; AMH
;;MULLERIAN-INHIBITING SUBSTANCE; MIS;;
MULLERIAN-INHIBITING FACTOR; MIF
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Male sex differentiation is mediated by 2 discrete hormones produced by
the fetal testis. Testosterone, produced by Leydig cells, virilizes the
external genitalia and promotes prostatic growth; anti-mullerian hormone
(AMH), also called mullerian-inhibiting substance (MIS) or factor (MIF),
results in regression of mullerian ducts which would otherwise
differentiate into the uterus and fallopian tubes.

CLONING

Picard et al. (1986) used mRNA prepared from fetal bovine testicular
tissue to construct a cDNA library. They isolated cDNAs encoding a
fragment of bovine AMH and showed by Northern blots that the gene was
expressed only in fetal testis and adult ovarian follicles.

Cate et al. (1986) isolated the human gene for MIF. The gene encodes a
560-amino acid polypeptide. The highly conserved C-terminal domain of
the protein shows marked homology with human transforming growth
factor-beta (190180) and the beta chain of porcine inhibin (147390).

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Lee et al. (1997) demonstrated that measurements of serum
mullerian-inhibiting substance can be used to determine testicular
status in prepubertal children with nonpalpable gonads, thus
differentiating anorchia from undescended testes in boys with bilateral
cryptorchidism and serving as a measure of testicular integrity in
children with intersexual anomalies.

To determine the value of assessing serum AMH levels in the diagnosis of
intersex conditions, Rey et al. (1999) assayed levels in 107 patients
with ambiguous genitalia of various etiologies. In XY patients, AMH was
low when the intersex condition was caused by abnormal testicular
determination (including pure and partial gonadal dysgenesis) but was
normal or elevated in patients with impaired testosterone secretion,
whereas serum testosterone was low in both groups. AMH was also elevated
during the first year of life and at puberty in intersex states caused
by androgen insensitivity. In 46,XX patients with a normal male
phenotype or ambiguous genitalia in whom the diagnosis of female
pseudohermaphroditism had been excluded, AMH levels greater than 75
pmol/L were indicative of the presence of testicular tissue and
correlated with the mass of functional testicular parenchyma. The
authors concluded that serum AMH determination is a powerful tool to
assess Sertoli cell function in children with intersex states that can
help to distinguish between defects of male sexual differentiation
caused by abnormal testicular determination and those resulting from
isolated impairment of testosterone secretion or action.

Misra et al. (2003) examined the role of MIS determination in the
evaluation of 65 phenotypic females with mild virilization. Among the 28
subjects with MIS values above the normal female range, all had abnormal
gonadal tissue: ovotestes in 11, testes in 7, dysgenetic gonads in 7,
and MIS-secreting ovarian tumors in 3. Among the 37 children with serum
MIS in the normal female range, 19 had detectable MIS and 18 had
unmeasurable MIS. In the former group with measurable but normal female
MIS values, 16 subjects had ovaries, 1 had an ovotestis, and 1 had
dysgenetic gonads containing testicular elements. Of 18 children with
undetectable MIS values, 16 had ovaries and 2 had ovarian dysgenesis.
The authors concluded that elevation of serum MIS above the normal
female range was consistently associated with the presence of testicular
tissue or MIS-secreting tumors, mandating additional evaluation and
surgical exploration.

To investigate the correlation between AMH levels and age of onset of
menopause, van Disseldorp et al. (2008) measured AMH levels in 144
fertile normal volunteers and determined the mean AMH as a function of
age. The authors found good conformity between the observed distribution
of age at menopause and that predicted from declining AMH levels. Van
Disseldorp et al. (2008) concluded that the similarity between observed
and predictive distributions of age at menopause supported the
hypothesis that AMH levels are related to onset of menopause.

GENE FUNCTION

Forest (1997) commented that there is no evidence of any biologic action
of mullerian-inhibiting substance after birth. Its overproduction in
patients with sex-cord tumors does not seem to have any harmful effects.

Wang et al. (2005) found that motor neurons of adult male and female
mice synthesized Mis and expressed its receptors. Mis supported survival
of embryonic motor neurons in vitro at physiologic concentrations,
suggesting that mature motor neurons use MIS for communication or as an
autocrine factor. Wang et al. (2005) postulated that MIS may have a
hormone effect in developing males due to the delayed development of the
blood-brain barrier, possibly resulting in sex-specific differences in
motor neurons.

Anttonen et al. (2005) studied the role of factors regulating normal
granulosa cell function, i.e., AMH, inhibin-alpha (147380),
steroidogenic factor-1 (SF1; 184757), and GATA transcription factors
(e.g., GATA4, 600576) in the pathobiology and clinical behavior of
granulosa cell tumors (GCTs). The more aggressive GCTs retained a high
GATA4 expression, whereas the larger tumors lost the
proliferation-suppressing AMH expression. Anttonen et al. (2005)
concluded that the high GATA4 expression in GCTs may serve as a marker
of poor prognosis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Cate et al. (1986) determined that the human MIF gene has 5 exons.

MAPPING

Cohen-Haguenauer et al. (1987) mapped the gene for AMH to 19p13.3-p13.2,
using in situ hybridization and Southern blot analysis of a panel of
human-mouse and human-hamster somatic cell hybrids.

By study of cow-hamster and cow-mouse somatic cell hybrids, Rogers et
al. (1991) showed that the AMH and SPARC (182120) genes are syntenic in
cattle. SPARC maps to chromosome 5 in the human.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Knebelmann et al. (1991) demonstrated a missense mutation in the AMH
gene in a patient with AMH-negative persistent mullerian duct syndrome
(see 600957.0001). By linkage mapping, King et al. (1991) demonstrated
that the Amh gene is on mouse chromosome 10. This analysis identified a
new region of linkage homology between human 19p and mouse 10.

Imbeaud et al. (1994) performed molecular analysis of the AMH gene in 21
patients with persistent mullerian duct syndrome (PMDS; 261550) and
their families. In 6 patients with normal serum concentration of AMH,
the AMH was normal or contained only polymorphisms and silent mutations,
supporting the hypothesis that the condition is due to end-organ
resistance. In the 15 remaining patients with low or undetectable levels
of serum AMH, 9 novel mutations were discovered. When present in
homozygotes or compound heterozygotes, these mutations were associated
with the PMDS phenotype, the same mutation never being observed in 2
different families. The first 3 exons of the AMH gene appeared
particularly mutation-prone, although they are less GC rich than the 2
last exons and code for the N-terminal part of the AMH protein, which is
not in itself essential to bioactivity.

Guerrier et al. (1989) demonstrated that not all cases of PMDS are
caused by a defect of the AMH gene itself; some patients express a
normal amount of bioactive testicular AMH. PMDS, characterized by the
presence of mullerian derivatives in otherwise normally virilized males,
is sometimes due to mutations in the AMH gene which abrogate AMH
production by the immature Sertoli cells and sometimes due to mutations
in AMHR (600956), the AMH receptor gene (Imbeaud et al., 1995). These 2
forms of persistent mullerian duct syndrome are referred to as types 1
and 2, respectively.

Imbeaud et al. (1996) reported results of molecular studies on 38
families with PMDS. They identified the basis of the condition: namely,
16 AMH and 16 AMH receptor mutations in 32 families. Six of the patients
were postpubertal, and in these patients determination of the level of
anti-mullerian hormone was no longer informative, since AMH production
is normally repressed after puberty. In prepubertal patients, the type
of genetic defect leading to PMDS could be predicted from the level of
serum AMH, which is very low or undetectable in PMDS type I due to AMH
mutations and at the upper limit of normal in receptor mutations. AMH
mutations were extremely diverse, and were identified in 16 families,
including 9 previously reported families (Imbeaud et al., 1994). Imbeaud
et al. (1996) reported that exon 1 and the 3-prime half of exon 5 of the
AMH gene are the main sites of deleterious changes including short
deletions and missense mutations.

To investigate the role of the AMH signaling pathway in the
pathophysiology of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS; see 184700),
Kevenaar et al. (2008) studied the association of the AMH I49S and the
AMHR -482A-G polymorphisms with PCOS susceptibility and phenotype in 331
women with PCOS and 32 normoovulatory controls, all Dutch Caucasians.
Allele and genotype frequency of these polymorphisms in the Dutch
Caucasian population were determined using 3,635 population-based
controls. Kevenaar et al. (2008) found that genotype and allele
frequencies for the 2 polymorphisms were similar in PCOS women and
controls. However, within the group of PCOS women, carriers of the AMH
49S allele less often had polycystic ovaries (92.7 vs 99.5%, P =
0.0004), lower follicle numbers (P = 0.03), and lower androgen levels,
compared with noncarriers (P = 0.04). In addition, in vitro studies
demonstrated that the bioactivity of the AMH 49S protein is diminished
compared with the AMH 49I protein (P less than 0.0001). Kevenaar et al.
(2008) concluded that while these genetic variants to not influence PCOS
susceptibility, the AMH I49S polymorphism contributes to the severity of
the PCOS phenotype.

ANIMAL MODEL

Mishina et al. (1996) produced and examined AMHR2 (600956) knockout
mice. They observed that mutant males were internal
pseudohermaphrodites, having both male and female reproductive organs.
The phenotype of AMH/AMHR2 double-knockout mutant males was
indistinguishable from that of either single mutant. Furthermore, the
phenotypes of AMH/alpha-inhibin and AMHR2/alpha-inhibin double-knockout
mutant males were also identical, suggesting to the authors that AMH is
the only ligand of the AMHR2 receptor.

Arango et al. (1999) introduced mutations into conserved Sf1 (184757)-
and Sox9 (608160)-binding sites within the endogenous mouse Mis
promoter. Male mice homozygous for the mutant Sf1-binding site correctly
initiated Mis transcription in fetal testes, although at significantly
reduced levels. Surprisingly, sufficient Mis was produced to eliminate
the mullerian ducts. In contrast, males homozygous for the mutant
Sox9-binding site did not initiate Mis transcription, resulting in
pseudohermaphrodites. These studies suggested an essential role for SOX9
in the initiation of MIS transcription, whereas SF1 appeared to act as a
quantitative regulator of MIS transcript levels, perhaps for influencing
non-mullerian duct tissues. Comparative studies of MIS expression in
vertebrates indicated that the MIS promoter receives transcriptional
inputs that vary between species but result in the same functional
readout.

Wang et al. (2009) presented evidence suggesting that AMH (MIS) is an
important factor in the generation of variability of 'sex-linked bias,'
or subtle behavioral differences between males and females. Most neurons
in the adult mouse brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nervous system, as
well as embryonic spinal cord motor neurons, expressed the Amhr2
receptor. Only trace levels of Amh were detected in embryonic head,
indicating that the prime embryonic source is from the testes. Male
Amh-null or Amhr2-null mice showed subtle feminization of spinal cord
motor neurons, i.e., fewer numbers of lumbar lateral motor neurons
compared to wildtype males. However, androgen-dependent features were
unaffected. Male Amhr2-null or Amh-null mice had partial feminization of
exploratory behavior. Wang et al. (2009) suggested that Amh may be a
regulator of neuronal pathways. The authors noted that Amh levels vary
in the male population, which may underlie subtle sex-linked biases.

NOMENCLATURE

Because MIF is also used as the symbol for macrophage migration
inhibitory factor (153620), AMH, for anti-mullerian hormone, will be
considered the preferred symbol for the locus on chromosome 19.

AMH, GLU358TER

In 3 brothers of Moroccan ancestry previously reported by Guerrier et
al. (1989) as having an AMH-negative form of PMDS (261550), Knebelmann
et al. (1991) identified a point mutation: a guanine-to-thymine
transversion at position 2096 in the fifth exon changing codon GAA (glu)
at position 358 to TAA (stop).

PERSISTENT MULLERIAN DUCT SYNDROME, TYPE I
AMH, 14-BP DEL, EX2

Carre-Eusebe et al. (1992) found 2 mutations in the AMH gene in the
3-month-old patient with PMDS (261550) reported by Harbison et al.
(1991). The child was born to healthy unrelated New York parents of
Italian descent. A right inguinal hernia was noted at the age of 1
month. Surgery on the 79th day of life revealed that both gonads were
within the right hernia sac. Attached to each gonad was an unremarkable
epididymis, vas deferens, and fallopian tube. Between the fallopian
tubes was what appeared to be an infantile uterus. No serum
anti-mullerian hormone could be detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay. Sequencing of cloned PCR-amplified fragments of the AMH gene
revealed a 14-bp deletion in the second exon of the maternal allele;
this deletion disrupted the open reading frame. Nucleotides 1074-1087
were deleted at a site containing two 8-bp direct repeats flanking a
6-bp sequence; the deletion removed one whole repeat plus all of the
intervening sequence. The deletion had resulted from slipped mispairing
at the DNA replication fork. The paternal allele contained an
arg191-to-ter mutation due to a C-to-T transition at nucleotide 1345
changing CGA to UGA and leading to the synthesis of a truncated protein
of 190 amino acid residues. A phenotypically normal younger sister had
the same 2 mutant alleles. In this family various other mutations of the
AMH gene, devoid of physiologic significance, were found, suggesting
that the AMH gene is highly polymorphic.

In brothers with bilateral cryptorchidism shown to have persistent

homozygosity for a 23-bp duplication in exon 5 of the AMH gene,
beginning at nucleotide 2349. Each parent was heterozygous for the
mutation.

603107	TITLE *603107 TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR 20; TCF20
;;STROMELYSIN 1 PDGF-RESPONSIVE ELEMENT-BINDING PROTEIN; SPBP;;
SPRE-BINDING PROTEIN;  AR1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Sanz et al. (1995) screened a mouse fibroblast expression library to
identify factors that bind to a 19-nucleotide promoter element called
the SPRE (stromelysin-1 PDGF-responsive element), which controls
stromelysin-1 (185250) expression in response to mitogen stimulation.
They isolated a cDNA encoding a predicted 937-amino acid protein
designated SPBP for 'SPRE-binding protein.' SPBP contains several
features characteristic of transcription factors, including a putative
leucine zipper region, a nuclear localization signal, and a basic domain
similar to the DNA-binding domain found in the Fos (164810)-Jun (165160)
family of transcription factors. However, whereas in Fos and Jun the ZIP
and DNA-binding domains lie very close together, in SPBP they are widely
separated. Sanz et al. (1995) found that expression of SPBP in mammalian
cells activated transcription of a reporter gene construct containing
either the full-length stromelysin promoter or a single copy of the SPRE
inserted upstream of a heterologous promoter.

Rajadhyaksha et al. (1998) identified cDNAs encoding AR1, a human SPBP
homolog.

MAPPING

By analysis of somatic cell hybrids and by fluorescence in situ
hybridization, Rajadhyaksha et al. (1998) localized the AR1 gene to
22q13.3.

by the nuclear genome (Kenmochi et al., 2001).

CLONING

By searching databases using bovine Mrpl4 as query, followed by PCR of
human genomic DNA, Kenmochi et al. (2001) cloned MRPL4.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis and analysis of an integrated BAC-STS map,
Kenmochi et al. (2001) mapped the MRPL4 gene to chromosome 19p13.2.

605570	TITLE *605570 RAS-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN RAB11A; RAB11A
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Small GTP-binding proteins of the RAB family, such as RAB11A, play
essential roles in vesicle and granule targeting (Bao et al., 2002).

CLONING

Using PCR to amplify Ras and Ras-like sequences from carcinoma and
T-cell cDNA libraries, Drivas et al. (1991) obtained a cDNA encoding
RAB11A, which they termed YL8. RAB11A shares 69% homology with yeast
Ypt3. The deduced 651-amino acid protein has many conserved features of
Ras and Rab proteins, except that its C terminus lacks the cys-cys found
in other Rab family members. Northern blot analysis detected expression
in 4 tumor cell lines.

By screening lambda libraries for small GTP-binding proteins, Gromov et
al. (1998) identified 2 cDNAs, arising from alternative splicing, that
encode RAB11A. Northern blot analysis revealed ubiquitous expression of
1.0- and 2.3-kb RAB11A transcripts, with highest levels in heart and
lowest levels in liver. The larger transcript was more abundant in brain
and lung, whereas the smaller transcript was more abundant in placenta
and heart.

Using RT-PCR, Bao et al. (2002) cloned RAB11A from human platelets.
Western blot analysis detected RAB11A at an apparent molecular mass of
26 kD in human platelets and leukemia cell lines. Western blot analysis
of rat tissues detected high Rab11a expression in platelets and much
lower expression in kidney, liver, heart, lung, and brain. Differential
centrifugation of human platelets showed enrichment of RAB11A in the
granule/mitochondrion and membrane fractions, with a small amount in the
cytosolic fraction.

GENE FUNCTION

Bao et al. (2002) noted that mutation of a conserved glutamine (Q70) to
leucine within the GTP-binding motif of RAB11A does not inhibit its
GTPase activity (Casanova et al., 1999), in contrast to the effect of
similar mutations in most small GTPases. Bao et al. (2002) found that
mutation of the conserved glutamines in RAB31 (605694) and RAB32
(612906) also had no effect on their GTPase activities, suggesting that
these proteins form a subfamily of small GTPases.

Shirane and Nakayama (2006) identified protrudin (ZFYVE27; 610243) as a
mammalian protein that promoted neurite formation through interaction
with the guanosine diphosphate (GDP)-bound form of Rab11.
Phosphorylation of protrudin by extracellular signal-regulated kinase
(ERK; 600997) in response to nerve growth factor (NGFB; 162030) promoted
protrudin association with Rab11-GDP. Downregulation of protrudin by RNA
interference induced membrane extension in all directions and inhibited
neurite formation. Thus, Shirane and Nakayama (2006) concluded that
protrudin regulates Rab11-dependent membrane recycling to promote the
directional membrane trafficking required for neurite formation.

In muscle and fat cells, insulin (INS; 176730) stimulation activates a
signaling cascade that causes intracellular vesicles containing glucose
transporter-4 (GLUT4, or SLC2A4; 138190) to translocate to and fuse with
the plasma membrane. Using mass spectrometry, Larance et al. (2005)
identified Rab10 (612672), Rab11, and Rab14 (612673) on Glut4 vesicles
from cultured mouse adipocytes. These vesicles also contained the RAB
GTPase-activating protein As160 (TBC1D4; 612465), suggesting that the
RAB proteins may be AS160 substrates.

In lethal systemic anthrax, proliferating bacilli secrete large
quantities of the toxins lethal factor (LF) and edema factor (EF),
leading to widespread vascular leakage and shock. Host targets of LF
(mitogen-activated protein-kinase kinases) and EF (cAMP-dependent
processes) have been implicated in the initial phase of anthrax. In an
investigation of toxin action during the final stage of infection,
Guichard et al. (2010) used Drosophila melanogaster to identify the
Rab11/Sec15 (609672) exocyst, which acts at the last step of endocytic
recycling, as a novel target of both EF and LF. EF reduces levels of
apically localized Rab11 and indirectly blocks vesicle formation by its
binding partner and effector Sec15 (Sec15-GFP), whereas LF acts more
directly to reduce Sec15-GFP vesicles. Convergent effects of EF and LF
on Rab11/Sec15 inhibited expression of and signaling by the Notch ligand
Delta and reduced DE-cadherin levels at adherens junctions. In human
endothelial cells, the 2 toxins acted in a conserved fashion to block
formation of Sec15 vesicles, inhibit Notch signaling through Delta
(DLL4; 605185), and reduce cadherin (CDH1; 192090) expression at
adherens junctions. Guichard et al. (2010) suggested that this
coordinated disruption of the Rab11/Sec15 exocyst by anthrax toxins may
contribute to toxin-dependent barrier disruption and vascular
dysfunction during Bacillus anthracis infection.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis and FISH, Gromov et al. (1998) mapped the
RAB11A gene to 15q21.3-q22.31.

603864	TITLE *603864 COPPER CHAPERONE FOR SUPEROXIDE DISMUTASE; CCS
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Copper (Cu) is required for aerobic life and yet, paradoxically, is
highly toxic. This apparent contradiction has been rationalized by
assuming that Cu, like other redox-active metals, is sequestered in
nonreactive forms as it is transported into cells and moves through
cellular compartments. Culotta et al. (1997) determined that one such Cu
chaperone protein, Lys7, specifically delivers Cu to copper/zinc
superoxide dismutase (Sod1; 147450) in S. cerevisiae. By searching EST
databases, they identified cDNAs encoding the human Lys7 homolog, which
they named CCS (copper chaperone for SOD1). The predicted 274-amino acid
human protein is 28% identical to Lys7. CCS complemented a yeast Lys7
mutation, demonstrating that CCS is a functional homolog of Lys7.
Northern blot analysis revealed that CCS was expressed as a 1.2-kb mRNA
in all tissues and cell lines tested.

MAPPING

Bartnikas et al. (2000) mapped the CCS gene to chromosome 11q13 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization. They mapped the mouse Ccs gene to
the proximal or centromeric end of chromosome 9 by haplotype analysis of
a backcross panel.

GENE FUNCTION

Casareno et al. (1998) found that the region of CCS encompassing amino
acids 86-234 shares 47% identity with human SOD1. The residues of SOD1
identical to those of CCS include all of the known Cu and zinc ligands,
the dimerization interface, and most of the amino acid residues mutated
in familial ALS (105400). Binding assays and coimmunoprecipitation
studies indicated that SOD1 and CCS directly interact in vitro and in
vivo via the homologous domains in each protein. Immunofluorescence
analysis experiments showed that CCS and SOD1 were distributed in an
identical pattern throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus of mammalian
cells. The authors proposed that Cu delivery to SOD1 is mediated via a
direct interaction with CCS.

Rae et al. (1999) demonstrated that the yeast Lys7 gene product, yCCS,
activates Sod1 through direct insertion of the Cu cofactor. They found
that the concentration of intracellular free Cu is limited to less than
one free Cu ion per cell, suggesting that a pool of free Cu ions is not
used in physiologic activation of metalloenzymes. Instead, Cu-dependent
enzymes require accessory factors, such as the metallochaperone CCS, to
compete with chelators and processes that sequester essentially all
intracellular free Cu.

Casareno et al. (1998) demonstrated that CCS interacts not only with
wildtype SOD1 but also with SOD1 containing the common missense mutation
resulting in familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FALS), A4V
(147450.0012), which is responsible for almost 50% of SOD1 mutations in
FALS cases. The findings revealed a common mechanism whereby different
SOD1 FALS mutants may result in neuronal injury and suggested a novel
therapeutic approach in patients affected by this fatal disease. The
delivery of copper by CCS to a target protein either unable or less able
to incorporate this metal would inevitably lead to copper-mediated
toxicity. Such a model is consistent with the failure to observe FALS in
transgenic mice lacking SOD1, because under such circumstances no
CCS-SOD1 interaction, and thus no copper transfer, will occur.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Huppke et al. (2012) identified mutations in the SLC33A1 gene (603690)
in patients with an autosomal recessive disorder of congenital
cataracts, hearing loss, and neurodegeneration (CCHLND; 614482). One of
the patients, who had a nonsense mutation (603690.0004), was a Turkish
boy who had additional features not found in the other patients,
including neonatal hypotonia, hypoglycemia, and a pericardial effusion.
In this patient, Huppke et al. (2012) later identified a homozygous
missense mutation in the CCS gene (603864.0001) and suggested that a
defect in copper homeostasis or SOD1 deficiency may have contributed to
the phenotype.

ANIMAL MODEL

Wong et al. (2000) generated mice deficient in Ccs by targeted
disruption. Although the Ccs -/- mice were viable and possessed normal
levels of Sod1 protein, they revealed marked reductions in Sod1 activity
when compared with control littermates. Metabolic labeling with
copper-64 demonstrated that the reduction of Sod1 activity in Ccs -/-
mice was the direct result of impaired copper incorporation into Sod1
and that this effect was specific because no abnormalities were observed
in copper uptake, distribution, or incorporation into other copper
enzymes. Consistent with this loss of Sod1 activity, Ccs -/- mice showed
increased sensitivity to paraquat and reduced female fertility,
phenotypes that are characteristic of Sod1-deficient mice. Wong et al.
(2000) concluded that their results demonstrate the essential role of
any mammalian copper chaperone.

Subramaniam et al. (2002) bred Ccs heterozygotes to Sod1 heterozygotes
generate double-knockout mice. Motor neurons in Ccs -/- mice showed
increased rate of death after facial nerve axotomy, a response
documented for Sod1 -/- mice. Thus, CCS is necessary for the efficient
incorporation of copper into SOD1 in motor neurons. Although the absence
of Ccs led to a significant reduction in the amount of copper-loaded
mutant Sod1, it did not modify the onset and progression of motor neuron
disease in Sod1-mutant mice. Subramaniam et al. (2002) concluded that
CCS-dependent copper loading of mutant SOD1 plays no role in the
pathogenesis of motor neuron disease in these mouse models.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
VARIANT OF UNKNOWN SIGNIFICANCE
CCS, ARG163TRP

This variant is classified as a variant of unknown significance because
its contribution to an early-onset neurodegenerative disorder has not
been confirmed.

In a Turkish boy, born of consanguineous parents, with an early-onset
neurodegenerative disorder resulting in death at age 3.5 years, Huppke
et al. (2012) identified a homozygous 487C-T transition in exon 5 of the
CCS gene, resulting in an arg163-to-trp (R163W) substitution at a highly
conserved residue in domain II. The patient had previously been reported
by Huppke et al. (2012) as having congenital cataracts, hearing loss,
and neurodegeneration (CCHLND; 614482) due to a homozygous truncating
mutation in the SLC33A1 gene (Y366X; 603690.0004). Complementation
studies in yeast lacking Ccs indicated that the mutant CCS protein
showed about 50% complementation compared to wildtype, and studies in
HeLa cells showed that the mutant CCS protein had decreased binding with
SOD1 (147450). Studies in patient fibroblasts showed that CCS protein
levels were about 40% of controls and that SOD1 (147450) enzyme activity
was significantly decreased. Patient fibroblasts also showed evidence of
the unfolded protein response, which may reflect cellular oxidative
stress. The patient with the CCS variant had additional symptoms not
present in the other patients with SLC33A1 mutations, including neonatal
hypotonia, hypoglycemia, and a pericardial effusion. At age 18 months,
he had rapid developmental regression and epilepsy with persistent
bilateral thalamic lesions on brain MRI. Huppke et al. (2012) suggested
that a defect in copper homeostasis or SOD1 deficiency may have
contributed to the phenotype in this patient. Direct DNA sequencing
excluded mutations in the CCS gene in 35 patients with developmental
delay and low serum copper and ceruloplasmin who did not have mutations
in the ATP7A (300011) or ATP7B (606882) genes.

602647	TITLE *602647 NUCLEAR RNA EXPORT FACTOR 1; NXF1
;;TIP-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN; TAP;;
MEX67, YEAST, HOMOLOG OF; MEX67
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Segref et al. (1997) identified a yeast gene, MEX67, that encodes a
factor essential for nuclear mRNA export. The Mex67 protein is found at
the nuclear pores, can be UV-crosslinked to polyadenylated RNA, and
interacts with a putative RNA-binding protein in a yeast 2-hybrid
screen. Thus, Segref et al. (1997) suggested that the Mex67 protein
participates directly in the export of mRNA from the nucleus to the
cytoplasm. They reported that the Mex67 protein is homologous to the
human 'tip-associated protein' (TAP).

The 'tyrosine kinase-interacting protein' (Tip) of herpesvirus saimiri
blocks LCK (153390)-mediated signal transduction and is essential for
primary T cell immortalization and for lymphoma induction in vivo. Using
the yeast 2-hybrid system to identify factors that associate with Tip,
Yoon et al. (1997) cloned a cDNA encoding 'tip-associated protein'
(TAP). The predicted 560-amino acid TAP protein migrates as a 65-kD
protein by SDS-PAGE. Northern blot analysis indicated that TAP was
expressed as 2.5- and 4.4-kb mRNAs in all tissues tested. Expression of
Tip and TAP in Jurkat-T cells induced cell aggregation, which was likely
caused by the upregulated surface expression of lymphocyte adhesion
molecules, and NF-kappa-B (164011, 164012) activity. Therefore, Yoon et
al. (1997) suggested that TAP is an important cellular mediator of Tip
function in T-cell transformation by herpesvirus saimiri.

GENE FUNCTION

Gruter et al. (1998) reported the identification of TAP as the cellular
factor that specifically binds to the CTE (constitutive transport
element) of the type D retroviruses. Microinjection experiments
performed in Xenopus oocytes demonstrated that TAP directly stimulates
CTE-dependent export. Furthermore, TAP overcomes the mRNA export block
caused by the presence of saturating amounts of CTE RNA. Thus, TAP, like
its yeast homolog Mex67, is an mRNA nuclear export mediator. TAP is
therefore a cellular RNA binding protein that is directly involved in
the export of its target RNA.

Using binding analysis, Herold et al. (2000) showed that NXF1, NXF2
(300315), and NXF3 (300316) interact with E1BAP5 (605800), as well as
with NXT1 (605811) and NXT2 (300320). The RBDs of NXF1 and NXF2, but not
that of NXF3, were found to bind RNA. Only NXF1, however, could promote
RNA export mediated by the constitutive transport element of simian type
D retrovirus. Both NXF1 and NXF2, but not NXF3, through their C-terminal
NWD loop, could bind to the nucleoporins CAN (NUP214; 114350), NUP153
(603948), and NUP62 (605815). Only NXF1 could bind to NUP98 (601021).
CAT reporter and Western blot assays showed that coexpression of NXF1 or
NXF2, but not NXF3, with NXT1 or NXT2 activated CAT expression,
suggesting that under these conditions NXF1 can also stimulate RNA
export. The LRRs and NTF2 (605813)-like domains are required for export
activity.

Shamsher et al. (2002) found that transportin-2 (603002) forms complexes
with TAP that strictly depend on the presence of RanGTP. The data
supported the conclusion that transportin-2 participates directly in the
export of a large proportion of cellular mRNAs, and that TAP connects
transportin-2 to mRNAs to be exported.

Li et al. (2006) showed that the TAP gene contains a functional
constitutive transport element (CTE) in its alternatively spliced intron
10. TAP mRNA containing this intron is exported to the cytoplasm and is
present in polyribosomes. A small TAP protein is encoded by this mRNA
and can be detected in human and monkey cells. Li et al. (2006)
concluded that TAP regulates expression of its own intron-containing RNA
through a CTE-mediated mechanism, and that CTEs are likely to be
important elements that facilitate efficient expression of mammalian
mRNAs with retained introns.

FMRP (FMR1; 309550) is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling RNA-binding protein
that participates in mRNA transport and translational control. Using
immunoprecipitation analysis and quantitative real-time RT-PCR, Zhang et
al. (2007) showed that Fmrp and Nxf2 were present in Nxf1
mRNA-containing ribonucleoprotein particles in cultured mouse neuronal
cells. Expression of Nxf2 led to destabilization of Nxf1 mRNA, and this
effect was abolished when Fmrp expression was reduced by small
interfering RNA. Zhang et al. (2007) concluded that FMRP and NXF2
collaborate to destabilize NXF1 mRNA.

MAPPING

Using genomic sequence analysis, Herold et al. (2000) mapped the NXF1
gene to chromosome 11 and determined that it contains at least 21 exons.
Hamilton et al. (1997) mapped the Mvb1 locus to proximal mouse
chromosome 19.

Windpassinger et al. (2003) observed that Human Genome Project sequence
data indicated that the NXF1 gene is located on 11q12-q14, the region to
which the locus for Silver spastic paraplegia syndrome (270685) had been
mapped. They excluded NXF1 as the mutant gene, as no mutations were
found on sequence analysis of at least 2 affected individuals from each
of 4 different families and 1 healthy control.

ANIMAL MODEL

In mice, the modifier-of-vibrator-1 locus (Mvb1) controls levels of
correctly processed mRNA from genes mutated by endogenous retrovirus
insertions into introns, including the Pitpn(vb) (600174) tremor
mutation and the Eya1(BOR) (601653) model of human branchiootorenal
syndrome. By positional complementation cloning, Floyd et al. (2003)
identified Mvb1 as the nuclear export factor Nxf1, providing an
unexpected link between the mRNA export receptor and pre-mRNA
processing. Population structure of the suppressive allele in wild Mus
musculus castaneus suggested selective advantage.
