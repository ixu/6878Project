;;IRE-BINDING PROTEIN 2; IRP2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Rouault et al. (1990) identified a second IRE-binding protein, for which
the degenerate screening of the oligonucleotide used in identifying the
cDNA for IREB1 (100880) also served as a successful sequencing primer.
The second IREBP, represented by 'clone 10.1,' contained an inserted
stretch of 73 amino acids between amino acids 37 and 38 of IREB1; the
IREB2 gene product lacked a region homologous to the sequences between
amino acids 436 and 470 of IREB1.

GENE FUNCTION

Hentze and Kuhn (1996) reviewed the function of IRP2. IRP2 is less
abundant than IRP1 (IREB1) in most cells. The strongest expression is in
intestine and brain (Henderson et al., 1993). Human IRP2 is 57%
identical to human IRP1. IRP2 has a molecular mass of 105 kD, which is
slightly larger than that of IRP1 due to a 73-amino acid insertion. Iwai
et al. (1995) demonstrated that the 73-amino acid insertion mediates
IRP2 degradation in iron-replete cells. Guo et al. (1994) and Samaniego
et al. (1994) showed that IRP2 has no aconitase activity.

Wu et al. (1999) demonstrated that the c-myc (190080) protein stimulates
expression of IRP2.

Meyron-Holtz et al. (2004) found that IRP2-null cells misregulated iron
metabolism when cultured in 3 to 6% oxygen, which is comparable to
physiologic tissue concentrations, but not in 21% oxygen, a
concentration that activated IRP1 (100880) and allowed it to substitute
for IRP2. Thus, IRP2 dominates regulation of mammalian iron homeostasis
because it alone registers iron concentrations and modulates its
RNA-binding activity at physiologic oxygen tensions.

Vashisht et al. (2009) found that a SKP1 (601434)-CUL1 (603134)-FBXL5
(605655) ubiquitin ligase protein complex associates with and promotes
the iron-dependent ubiquitination and degradation of IRP2. The F-box
substrate adaptor protein FBXL5 was degraded upon iron and oxygen
depletion in a process that required an iron-binding hemerythrin-like
domain in its N terminus. Thus, Vashisht et al. (2009) concluded that
iron homeostasis is regulated by a proteolytic pathway that couples IRP2
degradation to intracellular iron levels through the stability and
activity of FBXL5.

Salahudeen et al. (2009) independently found that the E3 ubiquitin
ligase complex containing the FBXL5 protein targets IRP2 for proteasomal
degradation. The stability of FBXL5 itself was regulated, accumulating
under iron- and oxygen-replete conditions and degraded upon iron
depletion. FBXL5 contains an iron- and oxygen-binding hemerythrin domain
that acted as a ligand-dependent regulatory switch mediating FBXL5's
differential stability. Salahudeen et al. (2009) concluded that these
observations suggested a mechanistic link between iron sensing via the
FBXL5 hemerythrin domain, IRP2 regulation, and cellular responses to
maintain mammalian iron homeostasis.

MAPPING

By Southern analysis of somatic cell hybrid DNAs, Rouault et al. (1990)
assigned the IREB2 gene to chromosome 15.

For discussion of a possible association between variation in the IREB2
gene and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, see 606963.

ANIMAL MODEL

LaVaute et al. (2001) showed that in mice, targeted disruption of the
Ireb2 gene resulted in misregulation of iron metabolism in the
intestinal mucosa and neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous
system. In adulthood, Ireb2 -/- mice developed a movement disorder
characterized by ataxia, bradykinesia, and tremor. Significant
accumulations of iron in white matter tracts and nuclei throughout the
brain preceded the onset of neurodegeneration and movement disorder
symptoms by many months. Ferric iron accumulated in the cytosol of
neurons and oligodendrocytes in distinctive regions of the brain.
Abnormal accumulations of ferritin colocalized with iron accumulations
in populations of neurons that degenerated. Ireb2 -/- mice initially
grew and developed normally. Mice older than 6 months of age developed a
progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized initially by an
unsteady, wide-based gait and subtle kyphosis followed by gradual onset
of ataxia, vestibular dysfunction, tremor, bradykinesia, and postural
abnormalities. Balance and grip strength measured using the hanging wire
test indicated severe impairment, whereas heterozygous mice showed an
intermediate degree of impairment.

Ghosh et al. (2008) reported that administration of tempol, a stable
nitroxide, to Irp2-null mice attenuated the progression of neuromuscular
impairment. In cell lines derived form Irp2-null mice and in the
cerebellum, brainstem, and forebrain of animals maintained on the tempol
diet, Irp1 was converted from a cytosolic aconitase to an IRE-binding
protein that stabilized the transferrin receptor-1 (TFRC; 190010)
transcript and repressed ferritin synthesis. Ghosh et al. (2008)
suggested that tempol protected Irp2-null mice by disassembling the
cytosolic iron-sulfur cluster of Irp1 and activating IRE binding
activity, which stabilized the TFRC transcript, repressed ferritin
synthesis, and partially restored normal cellular iron homeostasis in
the brain.

611970	TITLE *611970 MKI67-INTERACTING NUCLEOLAR PHOSPHOPROTEIN; MKI67IP
;;NUCLEOLAR PROTEIN INTERACTING WITH THE FHA DOMAIN OF PKI-67;;
NIFK;;
NOPP34
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By yeast 2-hybrid screening of a HeLa cell cDNA library using the
N-terminus of MKI67 (176741) as bait, Takagi et al. (2001) cloned
MKI67IP, which they called NIFK. The deduced 293-amino acid protein has
a calculated molecular mass of 34 kD and contains a potential
RNA-binding domain. NIFK shares 54% and 75% amino acid identity to its
mouse homolog overall and over the RNA-binding domain, respectively.
Immunocytochemical studies localized NIFK primarily to the nucleoli with
much reduced staining observed after RNAse treatment of cells,
suggesting that NIFK is an RNA-binding protein. After RNAse treatment,
the remaining NIFK protein was detected at the outer region of nucleoli
and may colocalize with MKI67 at the surface of mitotic chromosomes.

GENE FUNCTION

Using mitotic HeLa cell extracts, Takagi et al. (2001) showed that
phosphorylated NIFK interacted with the MKI67 FHA domain. Yeast 2-hybrid
analysis and binding assays using Xenopus oocyte extracts showed that
NIFK amino acids 226 to 269 interacted with the MKI67 FHA domain and
that the thr234 and thr238 residues were required for NIFK-MKI67 binding
in a mitosis-specific and phosphorylation-dependent manner.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the MKI67IP
gene to chromosome 2 (TMAP RH12564).

114090	TITLE *114090 CALPASTATIN; CAST
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Calpastatin is an endogenous inhibitor of calpains (see 114170)
consisting of 4 inhibitory repeats, each of which neutralizes an
activated calpain. Unlike proteinases, it is an intrinsically
unstructured protein, adopting a defined structure only upon binding to
active calpain ().

GENE FUNCTION

In erythrocytes of patients with essential hypertension (see 145500),
the level of calpastatin activity is significantly lower than in the red
cells of normotensive subjects. Pontremoli et al. (1988) demonstrated by
Western blot analysis that the decreased inhibitor activity is the
result of a decrease in the amount of the inhibitor protein. Calpastatin
isolated and purified from erythrocytes of normotensive and hypertensive
patients had identical specific activities. Pontremoli et al. (1988)
also presented evidence indicating that the decreased level of
calpastatin cannot be ascribed to accelerated decay during the red cell
life span.

Mimori et al. (1995) demonstrated that anti-calpastatin autoantibodies
are present in as many as 57% of rheumatoid arthritis patients and
concluded that they may participate in pathogenic mechanisms of this and
other rheumatic diseases which showed a lower frequency.

MAPPING

Using a cDNA probe encoding the 5-prime terminal region of CAST for
spot-blot analysis of sorted chromosomes and chromosomal in situ
hybridization, Inazawa et al. (1990) assigned the CAST gene to 5q14-q22.
Inazawa et al. (1991) mapped CAST to 5q15-q21 by 2 methods of in situ
hybridization and confirmed the results by spot-blot analysis of sorted
chromosomes.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Moldoveanu et al. (2008) reported the 3.0-angstrom crystal structure of
calcium-bound m-calpain (CAPN2; 114230) in complex with the first
calpastatin repeat, both from rat, revealing the mechanism of exclusive
specificity. The structure highlighted the complexity of calpain
activation by calcium, illustrating key residues in a peripheral domain
that serve to stabilize the protease core on calcium binding. Fully
activated calpain binds 10 Ca(2+) atoms, resulting in several
conformational changes allowing recognition by calpastatin. Calpain
inhibition is mediated by the intimate contact with 3 critical regions
of calpastatin. Two regions target the penta-EF-hand domains of calpain,
and the third occupies the substrate-binding cleft, projecting a loop
around the active site thiol to evade proteolysis.

Hanna et al. (2008) reported the 2.4-angstrom resolution crystal
structure of the calcium-bound calpain-2 (m-calpain) heterodimer bound
by 1 of the 4 inhibitory domains of calpastatin. They observed that
calpastatin inhibits calpain by occupying both sides of the active site
cleft. Although the inhibitor passes through the active site cleft it
escapes cleavage in a novel manner by looping out and around the active
site cysteine. The inhibitory domain of calpastatin recognizes multiple
lower affinity sites present only in the calcium-bound form of the
enzyme, resulting in an interaction that is tight, specific, and
calcium-dependent. Hanna et al. (2008) concluded that this crystal
structure, and that of the related complex described by Moldoveanu et
al. (2008), also revealed the conformational changes that calpain
undergoes on binding calcium, which include opening of the active site
cleft and movement of the domains relative to each other to produce a
more compact enzyme.

ANIMAL MODEL

Reduced sarcolemmal integrity in dystrophin (300377)-deficient muscles
of mdx mice and Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD; 310200) patients had
been reported to result in altered calcium homeostasis. Previous studies
had shown a correlative relationship between calpain activity in
dystrophic muscle and muscle necrosis, but had not tested whether
calpain activation precedes cell death or is a consequence of it.
Spencer and Mellgren (2002) generated mdx mice that overexpressed a
calpastatin transgene in muscle. Normal-appearing transgenic mice
overexpressing calpastatin were crossed with mdx mice. Two lines of mice
were examined, with different levels of calpastatin overexpression. Both
lines of transgenic/mdx mice showed reductions in muscle necrosis at 4
weeks of age. The extent of improvement correlated with the level of
calpastatin protein expression. Membrane damage, as assessed by procion
orange and creatine kinase assays, was unchanged, supporting the idea
that calpains act downstream of the primary muscle defect. The authors
hypothesized that calpains may play an active role in necrotic processes
in dystrophic muscle, and that inhibition of calpains might provide a
therapeutic option for treatment of DMD.

605251	TITLE *605251 ATP-BINDING CASSETTE, SUBFAMILY C, MEMBER 5; ABCC5
;;MULTIDRUG RESISTANCE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 5; MRP5;;
MOATC
DESCRIPTION Multidrug resistance (MDR) proteins (MRPs) mediate the extrusion of
drugs from normal cells and tumors. MDR/ATP-binding cassette (ABC)
membrane proteins are involved in energy-dependent transport of a wide
variety of substrates.

Allikmets et al. (1996) and Kool et al. (1997) used EST database
searching to identify partial cDNAs encoding ABCC5 (see ABCC4, 605250).
Using RT-PCR with degenerate primers, Suzuki et al. (1997) isolated a
cDNA encoding short MRP, an apparent splice variant of ABCC5 (Suzuki et
al., 2000). By EST database searching, followed by 5-prime RACE,
Belinsky et al. (1998) obtained a cDNA encoding full-length ABCC5, which
they termed MOATC (multispecific organic anion transporter C). Sequence
analysis predicted that the 1,437-amino acid protein, like other ABC
transporters, contains Walker A, B and C motifs, nucleotide-binding
folds, and 12 transmembrane spanning helices in 2 hydrophobic domains.
Kool et al. (1997), Suzuki et al. (1997), and Belinsky et al. (1998)
performed Northern blot analysis which revealed ubiquitous expression of
a 6.6-kb ABCC5 transcript with highest levels in skeletal muscle
followed by brain, kidney, testis, and heart.

McAleer et al. (1999) found differential expression of at least 3
different ABCC5 transcripts of approximately 10, 6.0 and 5.5 kb.
Immunofluorescence analysis revealed predominant plasma membrane
expression with some intracellular punctate staining. Overexpression of
ABCC5 did not increase resistance to various classes of anticancer
drugs.

Wijnholds et al. (2000) reported the functional characterization of
human MRP5. They found resistance against the thiopurine anticancer
drugs 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) and thioguanine, and the anti-HIV drug
9-(2-phosphonylmethoxyethyl)adenine (PMEA). This resistance was due to
an increased extrusion of PMEA and 6-thioinosine monophosphate from the
cells that overproduce MRP5. The authors speculated that MRP5 may play a
role in some cases of unexplained resistance to thiopurines in acute
lymphoblastic leukemia and/or to antiretroviral nucleoside analogs in
HIV-affected patients.

Oguri et al. (2000) noted that the effectiveness of platinum drugs in
lung cancer is limited by the development of drug resistance to them.
Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that expression of ABCC5, like that
of ABCC1 (158343) and gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (see 606857), is
increased in normal and tumor lung tissue from patients with previous
platinum exposure. However, in vitro exposure of lung cancer cells to
the platinum drug cisplatin, or of mononuclear cells to carboplatin,
does not cause increased expression of ABCC5.

By radiation hybrid analysis, Kool et al. (1997) mapped the ABCC5 gene
to chromosome 3. Using FISH, Suzuki et al. (1997) and Belinsky et al.
(1998) refined the localization to 3q27.

605964	TITLE *605964 SORTING NEXIN 15; SNX15
DESCRIPTION SNX15 is a member of the sorting nexin family of phox homology domain
(PX)-containing proteins that are homologous to yeast proteins involved
in protein trafficking (Phillips et al., 2001).

CLONING

By EST database searching with a consensus sequence for the PX domain of
several SNX molecules, followed by nested PCR on brain, lung, and liver
cDNA libraries, Phillips et al. (2001) obtained a full-length SNX15
cDNA. SNX15 encodes a deduced 342-amino acid protein as well as a
256-amino acid splice variant, designated SNX15A. SNX15 contains a
124-amino acid PX domain in the N terminus and a novel 73-amino acid
domain in the C terminus, which the authors designated the ESP domain.
SNX15A is identical to SNX15 except that it lacks 86 amino acids within
its C terminus, including a large portion of the ESP domain. Northern
blot analysis detected ubiquitous expression of an approximately 2-kb
SNX15 transcript, with highest expression in skeletal muscle, heart,
brain, kidney, spleen, thymus, and small intestine. Screening of 8
tissues by PCR detected SNX15 expression in lung, liver, skeletal
muscle, prostate, pancreas, and adult and fetal brain, and SNX15A
expression in adult brain, liver, and placenta. Although predicted to be
a soluble protein, both endogenous and overexpressed SNX15 were found on
membranes and in the cytosol.

MAPPING

Phillips et al. (2001) determined that SNX15 is identical to a clone
identified as an expressed gene on chromosome 11q13 by Guru et al.
(1997).

GENE FUNCTION

Using cotransfection experiments, Phillips et al. (2001) showed that
SNX15 associates with itself as well as with SNX1 (601272), SNX2
(605929), SNX4 (605931), and platelet-derived growth factor receptor
(PDGFR; see 173490). Its PX domain is required for its membrane
association and for its association with PDGFR. No association of SNX15
with receptors for epidermal growth factor (131550) or insulin (147670)
was found, but overexpression of SNX15 led to a decrease in the
processing of insulin and hepatocyte growth factor receptors (164860) to
their mature subunits. Immunofluorescence studies showed that
overexpression of SNX15 resulted in mislocalization of furin (136950),
the endoprotease responsible for cleavage of insulin and hepatocyte

603195	TITLE *603195 G PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTOR 32; GPR32
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Marchese et al. (1998) used PCR of human genomic DNA and genomic library
screening to isolate a novel gene, termed GPR32. GPR32 encodes a
356-amino acid polypeptide that has greatest similarity to
chemoattractant receptors, particularly the formylpeptide receptor
(FPR1; 136537). Marchese et al. (1998) also isolated a pseudogene, which
is 93% identical to GPR32 at the amino acid level, encoding a 4-bp
deletion relative to GPR32.

MAPPING

Marchese et al. (1998) used fluorescence in situ hybridization to map
both GPR32 and its pseudogene to human chromosome 19q13.3.

601962	TITLE *601962 TAP-BINDING PROTEIN; TAPBP
;;TAPASIN; TPSN; TPN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Newly assembled major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules
(see 142800), together with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperone
calreticulin (109091), interact with the transporter associated with
antigen processing (TAP1; 170260) through a molecule called tapasin
(Sadasivan et al., 1996). By molecular cloning of tapasin, Ortmann et
al. (1997) found it to be a type I transmembrane glycoprotein encoded by
an MHC-linked gene. The mature protein has 428 amino acids with a single
N-linked glycosylation site at position 233. It is a member of the
immunoglobulin superfamily with a probable cytoplasmic ER retention
signal. Up to 4 MHC class I/tapasin complexes were found to bind to each
TAP molecule in Daudi and L001 cells. Expression of tapasin in a
negative mutant human cell line restored class I/TAP association and
normal class I cell surface expression. Tapasin expression also
corrected the defective recognition of virus-infected cells of the same
line by class I-restricted cytotoxic T cells, thus establishing a
critical functional role for tapasin in MHC class I-restricted antigen
processing. Herberg et al. (1998) identified an EST encoding the mouse
tapasin homolog.

GENE FUNCTION

Mayer and Klein (2001) proposed that tapasin is in reality an MHC class
I molecule with a different function from that currently executed by
conventional class I molecules. They based this proposal on the amino
acid sequence similarity between tapasin and conventional class I
molecules, on similarity of predicted tertiary structure and domain
organization of the molecules, on similarity of exon/intron organization
of the encoding genes, and on the mapping of the class IA and tapasin
genes into the same chromosomal region in all jawed vertebrates that had
been tested to that time (Michalova et al., 2000).

Yabe et al. (2002) stated that HLA class I expression depends on the
formation of a peptide-loading complex composed of class I heavy chain;
beta-2-microglobulin (B2M; 109700); TAP; and tapasin, which links TAP to
the heavy chain.

Using purified proteins, Rizvi and Raghavan (2006) demonstrated direct
binding of TPN to peptide-deficient MHC class I molecules at physiologic
temperatures. TPN also bound mouse M10.5, a pheromone
receptor-associated protein with a class I-like fold. Class I-TPN
complexes containing B2M assembled more rapidly with peptides than
complexes lacking B2M. Peptide loading of class I inhibited class I-TPN
binding, whereas peptide depletion enhanced binding.

GENE STRUCTURE

Herberg et al. (1998) determined that the coding sequence of the tapasin
gene contains 8 exons, spanning approximately 12 kb. Teng et al. (2002)
noted the presence of a C-terminal KKxx ER retention motif in the TAPBP
gene. The promoter region of TAPBP contains gamma-interferon (IFNG;
147570) induction elements, but no TATA or CAATT boxes.

MAPPING

Ortmann et al. (1997) mapped the tapasin gene to 6p21.3 by analysis of
somatic cell hybrids containing chromosome 6 fragments and fluorescence
in situ hybridization. Herberg et al. (1998) localized the tapasin gene
to a position between the HSET (603763) and HKE1.5 genes and within 500
kb of the TAP1 and TAP2 (170261) genes. By inclusion within mapped
clones, they determined that mouse tapasin maps to chromosome 17 in a
region showing homology of synteny with human chromosome 6p21.3.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Mutations in the TAP2 gene (e.g., 170261.0004) result in an HLA class I
deficiency called type I bare lymphocyte syndrome (604571). Yabe et al.
(2002) described a 54-year-old woman with type I bare lymphocyte
syndrome who did not exhibit apparent TAP abnormalities but who had a
tapasin defect. The gene encoding tapasin had a 7.4-kb deletion between
introns 3 and 7 caused by an Alu repeat-mediated unequal homologous
recombination (601962.0001). No tapasin polypeptide was detected in the
subject's cells. The cell surface class I expression level in
tapasin-deficient cells was markedly reduced but the reduction was not
as profound as in TAP-deficient cells. Thus, tapasin deficiency is
another cause of type I BLS.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
BARE LYMPHOCYTE SYNDROME, TYPE I
TAPBP, 7.4-KB DEL

In a patient with tapasin deficiency and type I bare lymphocyte syndrome
(604571), Yabe et al. (2002) identified an Alu-mediated 7.4-kb deletion,
encompassing exons 4 through 7, in the TAPBP gene. The patient was a
54-year-old woman who suffered from chronic glomerulonephritis for 10
years. She had been receiving hemodialysis for 5 years. Because kidney
transplantation was being considered, she was subjected to serologic HLA
typing. Her class II antigens could be typed, but class I typing was not
possible. She had a history of herpes zoster and polyps of the stomach
and colon, but no respiratory and skin infections typical of
TAP-deficient subjects. The reason for this difference was not known.

607862	TITLE *607862 DIRAS FAMILY, GTP-BINDING RAS-LIKE PROTEIN 1; DIRAS1
;;DISTINCT SUBGROUP OF THE RAS FAMILY, MEMBER 1;;
RAS-RELATED INHIBITOR OF CELL GROWTH; RIG
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

DIRAS1 belongs to a distinct branch of the functionally diverse Ras (see
HRAS; 190020) superfamily of monomeric GTPases.

CLONING

By searching databases for proteins sharing homology with Ras, followed
by PCR and 5-prime RACE of a whole brain cDNA library, Kontani et al.
(2002) cloned DIRAS1. The deduced 198-amino acid protein contains
conserved phosphate/Mg(2+)-binding regions, an effector domain,
conserved guanine base-interacting residues, and a C-terminal
prenylation motif. DIRAS1 shares 79% identity with DIRAS2 (607863) and
32 to 40% identity with other Ras family members. Northern blot analysis
revealed strong expression of a 4.0-kb transcript in heart, whole brain,
and in most brain regions examined. Expression was weak or undetectable
in all other tissues tested.

By searching for novel farnesylated small GTPases, Ellis et al. (2002)
identified an EST containing DIRAS1, which they designated RIG, and they
cloned full-length DIRAS1 by PCR. DIRAS1 shares 63% homology with NOEY2
(605193), a tumor suppressor. Northern blot analysis detected high
expression of a single transcript in adult heart and brain and lower
expression in fetal heart and brain.

GENE FUNCTION

Kontani et al. (2002) noted that DIRAS1 and DIRAS2 have substitutions in
regions highly conserved within the Ras family, including changes in a
region critical for GTP hydrolysis in HRAS, and a change in an effector
domain residue that, in HRAS, is important for interaction with RAF
(164760). As predicted by these changes, DIRAS1 and DIRAS2 displayed low
GTPase activity and existed predominantly in the GTP-bound form in
transfected cells. Neither protein interacted with the Ras-binding
domain of RAF, resulting in no stimulation of mitogen-activated protein
kinase. When expressed at low levels as fluorescent-labeled proteins,
DIRAS1 and DIRAS2 showed plasma membrane localization. Upon
overexpression, they induced and were associated with large
intracellular vacuoles.

By Western blot analysis, Ellis et al. (2002) found that DIRAS1 was
undetectable or severely downregulated in 46% of early- and 71% of
late-stage primary astrocytomas. Overexpression of DIRAS1 inhibited
Ras-mediated cellular transformation and activation of downstream
signaling in NIH 3T3 cells. Expression of exogenous DIRAS1 suppressed
growth in astrocytoma cells.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Ellis et al. (2002) mapped the DIRAS1 gene
to chromosome 19p13.3.

611988	TITLE *611988 MITOCHONDRIAL RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN S26; MRPS26
;;MRPS13
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Mitochondria have their own translation system for production of 13
proteins essential for oxidative phosphorylation. MRPS26 is 1 of more
than 70 protein components of mitochondrial ribosomes that are encoded
by the nuclear genome (Kenmochi et al., 2001).

CLONING

By database analysis, Goldschmidt-Reisin et al. (1998) identified mouse,
rat, and human MRPS26, which they called MRPS13. The deduced human
protein contains a 27-amino acid N-terminal mitochondrial import signal.

By proteolytic digestion of whole bovine 28S subunits, followed by
peptide analysis and EST database analysis, Koc et al. (2001) identified
full-length human MRPS26. The deduced 205-amino acid MRPS26 protein has
a calculated molecular mass of 24.2 kD. Removal of the predicted
31-amino acid N-terminal mitochondrial localization signal results in a
mature protein of 20.8 kD. Koc et al. (2001) identified MRPS26 orthologs
in mouse and Drosophila, but not in C. elegans, yeast, or E. coli. Mouse
and human MRPS26 share 71.4% amino acid identity.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis and analysis of an integrated BAC-STS map,
Kenmochi et al. (2001) mapped the MRPS26 gene to chromosome 20p13.

606016	TITLE *606016 KELCH-LIKE ECH-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 1; KEAP1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

KEAP1 is a substrate adaptor protein for a CUL3 (603136)-dependent
ubiquitin ligase complex that functions as a sensor for thiol-reactive
chemopreventive compounds and oxidative stress (Lo and Hannink, 2006).

CLONING

Transcription factor NRF2 (600492), which is homologous to the chicken
Ech protein, is essential for the expression of detoxifying enzymes and
oxidative stress-inducible genes to protect against DNA damage. Using a
yeast 2-hybrid screen of a mouse embryo cDNA library with mouse Nrf2 as
bait, Itoh et al. (1999) isolated cDNAs encoding a protein they named
'Kelch-like Ech-associated protein-1,' or Keap1, due to its resemblance
to the Drosophila Kelch protein. Sequence analysis predicted that the
624-amino acid mouse protein is 94% identical to the 624-amino acid
human KIAA0132 protein identified by Nagase et al. (1995). Keap1
contains a central BTB/POZ domain and a C-terminal double glycine repeat
(DGR), or Kelch, module. By RT-PCR analysis, Nagase et al. (1995)
detected strong expression of KIAA0132 in heart and skeletal muscle,
with lower expression in brain, placenta, lung, liver, testis, ovary,
small intestine, and colon, and weaker or undetectable expression in
other tissues.

MAPPING

Nagase et al. (1995) mapped the KIAA0132 gene (KEAP1) to chromosome 19
by analysis of a human-rodent hybrid cell panel.

GENE FUNCTION

Using yeast 2-hybrid and BIAcore analyses of mutant Keap1, Itoh et al.
(1999) showed that the Kelch motifs of Keap1 interact with the Neh2
domain of Nrf2 and that this interaction is required for the repression
of Nrf2 by Keap1. Fluorescence microscopy demonstrated that Keap1 is
expressed in the cytoplasm with Nrf2. In the presence of the
electrophilic agent diethylmalate, Nrf2 activity was released from Keap1
and Nrf2 translocated to the nucleus.

Eades et al. (2011) found that microRNA-200A (MIR200A; 612090) bound to
the 3-prime UTR of the KEAP1 transcript, leading to degradation of the
mRNA. Epigenetic silencing of MIR200A in breast cancer cells resulted in
KEAP1 dysregulation, inhibition of NRF2 transcriptional activity, and
reduced expression of NQO1 (125860), a detoxifying NRF2 target gene.
Overexpression of MIR200A in human breast cancer cells or treatment of a
mouse model of breast cancer with a histone deacetylase inhibitor
enhanced MIR200A-dependent KEAP1 downregulation and restored NRF2
expression.

Using mass spectrometric analysis and database analysis to identify
transcripts encoding proteins other than NRF2 that copurified with KEAP1
from the MD-MB-231 breast carcinoma cell line, Lo and Hannink (2006)
identified 2 splice variants of PGAM5 (614939). Protein interaction
assays and mutation analysis revealed that the putative N-terminal
KEAP1-binding motif of both PGAM5 isoforms interacted with the Kelch
domain of KEAP1 in transfected HEK293T cells. Coexpression of KEAP1 with
the long isoform of PGAM5 (PGAM5L) resulted in PGAM5L ubiquitination and
reduced PGAM5L half-life and total protein content. Coexpression of CUL3
and RBX1 (603814) markedly induced KEAP1-dependent PGAML ubiquitination,
and proteasome inhibition blocked KEAP1-dependent PGAM5L degradation.
Oxidative stress or treatment of cells with the chemotherapeutic
isothiocyanate sulforaphane inhibited KEAP1-dependent PGAM5L
ubiquitination and increased steady-state PGAM5L protein levels.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Padmanabhan et al. (2006) resolved the crystal structure of the 6-bladed
Kelch repeat and the C-terminal region of mouse Keap1. Extensive inter-
and intrablade hydrogen bonds maintained the structural integrity and
proper association of Keap1 with Nrf2. A peptide containing the ETGE
motif of Nrf2 bound the beta propeller of Keap1 at the entrance of the
central cavity on the bottom side via electrostatic interactions with
conserved arginines. Padmanabhan et al. (2006) identified 2 mutations in
cell lines from lung cancer patients that disrupted the interaction
between Keap1 and Nrf2, thus reducing the ability of Keap1 to repress
Nrf2 transcriptional activity.

ANIMAL MODEL

Transcription factor NRF2 (600492) regulates a battery of detoxifying
and antioxidant genes, and KEAP1 represses NRF2 function. Wakabayashi et
al. (2003) found that Keap1-deficient mice died postnatally, probably
from malnutrition resulting from hyperkeratosis in the esophagus and
forestomach. Nrf2 activity affects the expression levels of several
squamous epithelial genes. Biochemical data showed that, without Keap1,
Nrf2 constitutively accumulates in the nucleus to stimulate
transcription of cytoprotective genes. Breeding to Nrf2-deficient mice
reversed the phenotypic Keap1 deficiencies. These experiments showed
that Keap1 acts upstream of Nrf2 in the cellular response to oxidative
and xenobiotic stress.

Wakabayashi et al. (2003) observed that the transient scaling phenotype
of Keap1 -/- mouse skin is similar to that of autosomal recessive
congenital ichthyosis (ARCI). In a Finnish kindred, Virolainen et al.
(2000) identified an ARCI locus corresponding to 19p13.2-p13.1 (see
ARCI5; 604777). The human KEAP1 locus is located at the same chromosomal
position as this autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis locus. Thus,
KEAP1 may have some relationship to congenital ichthyosis. The scaling
of the reported Finnish cases was mild, as in the scaling phenotype of
the Keap1 mutants, but the neonatal onset of the disorder in Keap1
mutants differed from the human disorder.

601093	TITLE *601093 FORKHEAD BOX I1; FOXI1
;;FORKHEAD, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG-LIKE 10; FKHL10;;
FKH10;;
FORKHEAD-RELATED ACTIVATOR 6; FREAC6
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

FKH10 is a member of the forkhead family of winged helix transcription
regulators. The forkhead family is distinguished by a characteristic
100-amino acid motif that was originally identified in Drosophila (see
164874). Pierrou et al. (1994) identified 7 human genes containing a
forkhead domain and designated them forkhead related activators (FREAC)
1 through 7. Northern blot analysis revealed that the FREAC6, or FKHL10,
gene is expressed as a 2.3-kb mRNA only in kidney.

GENE FUNCTION

Larsson et al. (1995) showed that human FKHL10 is expressed in the adult
and fetal kidney, whereas 15 other tissues (which did not include any
inner ear-derived samples) were negative. Kidney-specific expression had
been observed also in the mouse. Although Fkh10 may play a role in the
kidney during later stages of development, it may be a minor, or perhaps
redundant, role, as no kidney dysfunction was observed in homozygous
knockout mice. On the contrary, Fkh10 appears to be unique in the sense
that it is an early otic vesicle-specific gene necessary for the
development of both cochlea and vestibulum. These findings implicated
Fkh10 as an early regulator necessary for development of both cochlea
and vestibulum and identified its human homolog, FKHL10, as a candidate
deafness gene at 5q34. The phenotype described by Hulander et al. (1998)
resembles a group of human congenital inner ear malformations called
'common cavity.' Hulander et al. (1998) proposed that mutations in FKH10
may cause a 'common cavity' phenotype in humans.

Yang et al. (2007) demonstrated that FOXI1 is a transcription factor for
SLC26A4 (605646) and identified and characterized a key transcriptional
regulatory element in the SLC26A4 promoter that binds FOXI1. The SLC26A4
cis element consists of 2 FOXI1 binding sites, FBS1 and FBS2, arranged
head to head. Both binding sites and this specific orientation are
required for FOXI1-mediated transcriptional activation.

MAPPING

Larsson et al. (1995) mapped the FKHL10 gene to 5q34 by fluorescence in
situ hybridization and somatic cell hybrid analysis.

ANIMAL MODEL

Genes encoding forkhead proteins are instrumental during embryogenesis
in mammals, in particular during development of the nervous system.
Hulander et al. (1998) reported that mice with a targeted disruption of
the Fkh10 locus exhibited circling behavior, poor swimming ability, and
abnormal reaching response, all common findings in mice with vestibular
dysfunction. These animals also failed to elicit a Preyer reflex in
response to a suprathreshold auditory stimulation, as seen in mice with
profound hearing impairment. Histologic examination of the inner ear
revealed a gross structural malformation of the vestibulum as well as of
the cochlea. These structures were replaced by a single irregular cavity
in which neither proper semicircular ducts nor cochlea could be
identified. Hulander et al. (1998) also showed that at 9.5 days
postcoitum, Fkh10 was exclusively expressed in the otic vesicle.

Blomqvist et al. (2004) found that whereas macro- and microscopic kidney
development appeared normal in Fkhl10-null mice, electron microscopy
revealed an altered ultrastructure of cells lining the distal nephron.
Northern blot analyses, cRNA in situ hybridizations, and
immunohistochemistry demonstrated complete loss of expression of several
anion transporters, proton pumps, and anion exchange proteins expressed
by intercalated cells of the collecting ducts. The normal renal
epithelium with its 2 major cell types, principal and intercalated
cells, had been replaced by a single cell type positive for both
principal and intercalated cell markers. The null mice were unable to
acidify urine and had a lowered systemic buffer capacity and overt
acidosis compared to their wildtype littermates. Blomqvist et al. (2004)
concluded that Fkhl10-null mice develop distal renal tubular acidosis
due to altered cellular composition of the distal nephron epithelium,
which lacks the proper gene expression pattern needed for maintaining
adequate acid-base homeostasis.

Mice homozygous for the targeted deletion of Foxi1 have a phenotype that
includes cochlear dysplasia and enlarged vestibular aqueduct (Hulander
et al., 2003). Also included in the Foxi1 -/- mouse phenotype are male
infertility and distal renal tubular acidosis (Blomqvist et al., 2004,
2006), 2 abnormalities that had not been reported in humans with Pendred
syndrome or enlarged vestibular aqueduct.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Recessive mutations in the anion transporter gene SLC26A4 (605646) are
known to be responsible for Pendred syndrome (274600) and for
nonsyndromic hearing loss associated with enlarged vestibular aqueduct
(DFNB4; 600791). However, a large percentage of patients with these
phenotypes lack mutations in the SLC26A4 coding region in one or both
alleles. Yang et al. (2007) identified and characterized a key
transcriptional regulatory element in the SLC26A4 promoter that binds
FOXI1, which is a transcriptional activator of SLC26A4. They found 9
patients with Pendred syndrome or nonsyndromic EVA who were heterozygous
for a novel -103T-C mutation (605646.0027) in this regulatory element,
which interfered with FOXI1 binding and completely abolished
FOXI1-mediated transcriptional activation. They also identified 2
Pendred and 4 EVA patients with heterozygous mutations in FOXI1 that
compromised its ability to activate SLC26A4 transcription; 1 of the EVA
patients was a double heterozygote who also carried a heterozygous
mutation in the SLC26A4 gene (see 605646.0028 and 601093.0001). This
finding was consistent with their observation that EVA occurs in the
mouse mutant doubly heterozygous for mutations in these 2 genes, and the
results supported a dosage-dependent model for the molecular
pathogenesis of Pendred syndrome and nonsyndromic EVA that involves
SLC26A4 and its transcriptional regulatory machinery. Mutations in many
transcription factors had been shown to lead to nonsyndromic or
syndromic hearing impairment, but the FOXI1/SLC26A4 connection was the
first identification of a specific downstream target gene; Yang et al.
(2007) stated the this was the first example of digenic inheritance to
be verified as a cause of human deafness.

Yang et al. (2007) described a patient with enlarged vestibular aqueduct
as the basis of nonsyndromic hearing loss (DFNB4; 600791) in whom the
combination of a heterozygous glu29-to-gln (E29Q) mutation of SLC26A4
(605646.0028) and a gly258-to-glu (G258E) mutation of FOXI1 was
responsible. Each unaffected parent was heterozygous for 1 of the
mutations, and her unaffected sister carried only the E29Q mutation in
SLC26A4. Yang et al. (2007) concluded that this was the first example of
digenic inheritance to be verified as a cause of human deafness.

In 2 families given a diagnosis of DFNB4 with EVA (600791), Yang et al.
(2007) found heterozygosity for an arg267-to-gln change (R267Q) in the
FOXI1 protein. Although both of these families were classified by the
authors as 'nonsyndromic EVA,' in one of them goiter reminiscent of
Pendred syndrome (274600) was noted. Both alleles of the SLC26A4 gene
(605646) were wildtype. The R267Q mutation showed significantly
decreased luciferase activation in promoter-reporter assays, suggesting
that this variant compromised FOXI1 transactivation ability of SLC26A4
expression and was causally related to disease.

607931	TITLE *607931 ATAXIN 2-LIKE; ATXN2L
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ATXN2L associates with the thrombopoietin (TPO; 600044) receptor, MPL
(159530), and is a component of a cytokine signaling cascade following
receptor activation (Meunier et al., 2002).

CLONING

Using the cytoplasmic domain of MPL as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen,
Meunier et al. (2002) isolated a partial clone of ATXN2L from a
megakaryoblast cell line cDNA library. They obtained the full-length
cDNA by probing a Jurkat T-cell cDNA library. The deduced protein
contains 1,076 amino acids. Meunier et al. (2002) identified 3 putative
initiation sites and several variants that differ in their C termini.
ATXN2L contains 3 domains that share significant homology with ataxin-2
(601517). The N terminus of ATXN2L has 8 interrupted glutamines
replacing the polyglutamine tract of ataxin-2. Northern blot analysis
detected major ATXN2L transcripts at 4.0 and 4.5 kb expressed at high
levels in thymus, lymph node, spleen, fetal kidney, and adult testis.
ATXN2L was also expressed in several other hematopoietic and fetal
tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

Meunier et al. (2002) showed that endogenous ATXN2L was associated with
MPL in a hematopoietic cell line and that ATXN2L interacted specifically
with a 24-amino acid C-terminal segment of the receptor. Thrombopoietin
caused the release of ATXN2L from the activated receptor, and the
phosphorylation of ATXN2L on tyrosine residues by TPO was dependent on
the 24-amino acid C-terminal domain of MPL. ATXN2L also bound to the
unstimulated erythropoietin receptor (133171), and erythropoietin
(133170) caused its dissociation. Meunier et al. (2002) concluded that
ATXN2L is a novel component of the cytokine signaling system.

MAPPING

By FISH, Meunier et al. (2002) mapped the ATXN2L gene to chromosome
16p11 and an ATXN2L pseudogene to chromosome 7p21.

153243	TITLE *153243 TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR RECEPTOR SUPERFAMILY, MEMBER 8; TNFRSF8
;;LYMPHOID ACTIVATION ANTIGEN CD30; CD30
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

In Hodgkin disease, the lymphoid activation antigen CD30 (Ki-1) is
expressed on the tumor cells (Stein et al., 1982). Durkop et al. (1992)
cloned the cDNA encoding the CD30 molecule.

GENE FUNCTION

By in vitro binding, immunoprecipitation, immunoblot, and yeast 2-hybrid
analyses, Aizawa et al. (1997) showed that TRAF2 (601895) and TRAF5
(602356) interact with overlapping but distinct sequences in the
C-terminal region of CD30 and mediate the activation of nuclear factor
kappa-B (see 164011).

Several chronic inflammatory skin diseases are associated with increased
numbers of mast cells and increased expression of CD30. Fischer et al.
(2006) found that activation of mast cells in vitro with CD30 resulted
in degranulation-independent secretion of the chemokines IL8 (146930),
CCL3 (182283), and CCL4 (182284) in a MAP kinase-dependent manner. Mast
cells were the predominant CD30L (603875)-positive cells in lesional
skin from psoriasis and atopic dermatitis patients, and both CD30 and
CD30L were upregulated in lesional skin in these conditions. The number
of IL8-positive mast cells was also upregulated in psoriatic and atopic
dermatitis lesional skin, and treatment of healthy skin organ cultures
with CD30 resulted in IL8 expression. Fischer et al. (2006) concluded
that CD30 mast cell activation represents an IgE-independent activation
pathway important for understanding cutaneous inflammation associated
with mast cells.

To gain insight into the mechanism of CD30 signaling in anaplastic large
cell lymphoma and Hodgkin lymphoma, Wright and Duckett (2009) used an
affinity purification strategy that led to the identification of the
aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT; 126110) as a
CD30-interacting protein that modulates the activity of the RelB subunit
(604758) of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa-B (NFKB; see
164011). Anaplastic large cell lymphoma cells that were deficient in
ARNT exhibited defects in RelB recruitment to NFKB-responsive promoters,
whereas RelA (164014) recruitment to the same sites was potentiated,
resulting in the augmented expression of these NFKB-responsive genes.
Wright and Duckett (2009) concluded that ARNT functions in concert with
RelB in a CD30-induced negative feedback mechanism.

MAPPING

Fonatsch et al. (1992) demonstrated by in situ hybridization that the
CD30 gene is located in the region 1p36. To increase the number of
markers on distal mouse chromosome 4, McClive and Morahan (1994) used
probes corresponding to loci on human 1p, known to have synteny homology
to mouse chromosome 4, to reveal polymorphisms between C57BL/6 and DBA/2
mice, the progenitors of the 26 BXD recombinant inbred strains. Cd30 was
tested with mouse-specific microsatellite markers and assigned to the
genetic map of mouse chromosome 4.

HISTORY

Kurts et al. (1999) identified what they thought was a new mechanism
that protects against autoimmunity mediated through CD30. In an erratum,
they stated that the effects attributed to CD30 were the result of a
background gene or genes of mouse strain 129 origin.

607275	TITLE *607275 HOP HOMEOBOX; HOPX
;;HOMEODOMAIN-ONLY PROTEIN; HOP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching an EST database using the PAX3 (606597) homeodomain as
probe, Chen et al. (2002) identified mouse Hop. They identified human
HOP by further EST database searching. The human and mouse proteins
contain 73 amino acids, including a 60-amino acid motif homologous to
HOX proteins, and share 92% identity. They are most closely related to
the homeodomain proteins HOX6 and goosecoid (138890), with approximately
40% identity within the homeodomain-like domain. HOP lacks certain
conserved residues required for DNA binding. In mouse, Hop gene
expression initiates early in cardiogenesis and continues in
cardiomyocytes throughout embryonic and postnatal development. Northern
blot analysis of adult and embryonic mouse tissues detected a 1.2-kb
transcript in embryonic and adult heart and in adult brain, intestine,
and spleen. Immunohistochemistry confirmed that Hop is a nuclear
protein.

Shin et al. (2002) independently cloned mouse Hop and identified the
human homolog. They determined that Hop forms 3 alpha helices with a
helix-turn-helix motif characteristic of the homeodomain. Northern blot
analysis of mouse tissues detected a 1.3-kb transcript in heart, lung,
brain, and liver. Hop was highly expressed in developing heart, where
its expression was dependent on the cardiac-restricted homeodomain
protein Nkx2.5 (CSX; 600584).

GENE FUNCTION

Genetic and biochemical data indicated to Chen et al. (2002) that mouse
Hop functions directly downstream of Nkx2.5. They showed that Hop
physically interacts with serum response factor (SRF; 600589) and
inhibits activation of SRF-dependent transcription by inhibiting SRF
binding to DNA. Chen et al. (2002) concluded that HOP is an unusual
homeodomain protein that modulates SRF-dependent, cardiac-specific gene
expression and cardiac development.

Shin et al. (2002) confirmed that mouse Hop does not bind DNA and acts
as an antagonist of SRF, which regulates the opposing processes of
proliferation and myogenesis.

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Kee et al. (2007) found that HOP interacted
with EPC1 (610999). Expression of Epc1 was upregulated during
differentiation of a rat myoblast cell line into skeletal myocytes.
Differentiation was induced by Epc1 overexpression and was severely
impaired in Epc1-knockdown cells. Cotransfection of Hop potentiated
Epc1-induced transactivation of myogenin (MYOG; 159980) and myotube
formation. Skeletal muscle of Hop-knockout mice showed decreased
expression of myosin heavy chain (see 160730) and myogenin, and
hamstring muscle of Hop-knockout mice showed delayed healing after
injury. Differentiation was impaired in skeletal myoblasts from
Hop-knockout mice. Kee et al. (2007) concluded that EPC1 plays a role in
initiation of skeletal muscle differentiation and that its interaction
with HOP is required for full activity.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the HOP
gene to chromosome 4 (TMAP WI-6363).

ANIMAL MODEL

Chen et al. (2002) found that inactivation of Hop in mice by homologous
recombination resulted in a partially penetrant embryonic lethal
phenotype with severe developmental cardiac defects involving the
myocardium. Inhibition of Hop activity in zebrafish embryos likewise
disrupted cardiac development and resulted in severely impaired cardiac
function.

Shin et al. (2002) showed that mice homozygous for a Hop null allele
segregated into 2 phenotypic classes characterized by an excess or
deficiency of cardiac myocytes. They proposed that Hop modulates SRF
activity during heart development and that its absence results in an
imbalance between cardiomyocyte proliferation and differentiation, with
consequent abnormalities in cardiac morphogenesis.

Using transgenic mice in which Hop was expressed in the heart under the
control of the alpha-MHC promoter, Kook et al. (2003) showed that Hop
can inhibit SRF-dependent transcriptional activation by recruiting
histone deacetylase (HDAC; see 601241) activity and can form a complex
that includes HDAC2 (605164). Transgenic mice overexpressing Hop
developed severe cardiac hypertrophy, cardiac fibrosis, and premature
death. A mutant form of Hop, which does not recruit HDAC activity, did
not induce hypertrophy. Treatment of Hop transgenic mice with
trichostatin A, an HDAC inhibitor, prevented hypertrophy. Kook et al.
(2003) concluded that chromatin remodeling and repression of otherwise
active transcriptional processes can result in hypertrophy and heart
failure, and that this process can be blocked with chemical HDAC
inhibitors.

602986	TITLE *602986 DEVELOPMENTALLY REGULATED GTP-BINDING PROTEIN 2; DRG2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a subtractive hybridization strategy, Schenker et al. (1994)
identified embryonic lung fibroblast cDNAs whose expression was
selectively repressed in SV40-transformed cells. One cDNA encoded a
predicted 364-amino acid protein that was designated DRG2. DRG2 contains
the 5 sequence motifs that are conserved in all GTP-binding proteins.
Northern blot analysis detected DRG2 expression as a major 2-kb and a
minor 1.5-kb transcript in various tissues. The shorter mRNA appeared to
result from use of an alternative polyadenylation site.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Schenker and Trueb (1997) mapped
the DRG2 gene to 17p13-p12. Vlangos et al. (2000) mapped the DRG2 gene
to 17p11.2 within the Smith-Magenis syndrome critical region by somatic
cell hybrid analysis.

609764	TITLE *609764 LYSINE-SPECIFIC DEMETHYLASE 4A; KDM4A
;;JUMONJI DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 2A; JMJD2A;;
JHDM3A;;
KIAA0677
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

KDM4 proteins are Fe(II)- and alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent oxygenases
that function as histone demethylases. KDM4A plays important roles in a
variety of biologic processes, including transcription and DNA damage
response, through demethylation of histone H3 (see 602810) lys9 (H3K9)
and lys36 (H3K36) di- and trimethylation (summary by Tan et al. (2011)).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated human brain cDNA
library, Ishikawa et al. (1998) cloned JMJD2A, which they designated
KIAA0677. The deduced protein shares significant similarity with a zinc
finger protein of S. cerevisiae. RT-PCR detected JMJD2A in all tissues
examined, with highest expression in ovary.

By searching for sequences similar to JMJD1C (604503), Katoh and Katoh
(2004) identified several JMJD2 family genes, including JMJD2A. JMJD2A
encodes a deduced 1,064-amino acid protein. Like JMJD2B (609765) and
JMJD2C (605469), JMJD2A contains a JmjN domain, a JmjC domain, a JD2H
domain, 2 TUDOR domains, and a bipartite nuclear localization signal
that overlaps the C-terminal part of the second TUDOR domain. JmjN is a
small domain found in the Jumonji family of transcription factors (see
601594). JmjC is a putative enzymatic domain. JD2H is a region
containing 2 cys-his clusters with weak similarity to a PHD domain.

GENE FUNCTION

Klose et al. (2006) demonstrated that JMJD2A is capable of removing the
trimethyl group from modified H3K9 and H3K36. Overexpression of JMJD2A
abrogates recruitment of HP1 (see 604478) to heterochromatin, indicating
a role for JMJD2A in antagonizing methylated H3K9 nucleated events.
siRNA-mediated knockdown of JMJD2A leads to increased levels of H3K9
methylation and upregulation of a JMJD2A target gene, ASCL2 (601886),
indicating that JMJD2A may function in euchromatin to remove histone
methylation marks that are associated with active transcription.

Whetstine et al. (2006) showed that JMJD2A reversed trimethylated H3K9
and H3K36 to dimethylated products, but not to monomethylated or
unmethylated products. Overexpression of JMJD2A, but not a catalytically
inactive mutant, reduced H3K9 and H3K36 trimethylation levels in
cultured cells.

Tan et al. (2011) noted that the abundance of KDM4A protein, but not
mRNA, is cell cycle dependent, with highest levels in G1 and S phase and
reduced levels in G2 and during mitosis. Using human cell lines, they
showed that KDM4A protein was subject to proteasome-mediated degradation
via the SKP1 (SKP1A; 601434)-CUL1 (603134)-F-box protein (SCF) ubiquitin
ligase complex. Immunoprecipitation analysis of F box
protein-transfected cells revealed that KDM4A specifically interacted
with FBXO22 (609096) and not with other F-box proteins tested. Mutation
analysis showed that the C-terminal FIST-C domain of FBXO22 interacted
with the N-terminal JmjN/JmjC domain of KDM4A. Knockdown and
overexpression studies revealed that KDM4A polyubiquitination mediated
by the FBXO22-containing SCF complex led to reduced KDM4A protein
levels. Subsequently, reduced KDM4A levels permitted elevated global
content of H3K9 and H3K36 trimethylation and specifically elevated
trimethylation of the ASCL2 promoter, resulting in increased ASCL2
transcription.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structures

Chen et al. (2006) solved the crystal structure of the catalytic core
domain of JMJD2A with and without alpha-ketoglutarate in the presence of
Fe(2+). The catalytic core region spans residues 1 to 350 and includes
the N-terminal JmjN domain, followed by a long beta hairpin motif, a
motif composed of mixed helices and beta strands, the JmjC domain, and a
C-terminal domain. Chen et al. (2006) also identified a zinc finger
motif within this region, in which the JmjC domain provides a cysteine
and a histidine and the C-terminal domain contributes 2 cysteines.
Structural analysis suggested that a region near beta strands 5 and 6,
which are located between the JmjN and JmjC domains, may function in
substrate peptide binding. Mutation analysis revealed that ser288 and
thr289 are involved in methyl group recognition.

Ng et al. (2007) demonstrated how human JMJD2A, which is selective
towards tri- and dimethylated histone H3 lysyl residues 9 and 36
(H3K9me3/me2 and H3K36me3/me2), discriminates between methylation states
and achieves sequence selectivity for H3K9. The authors reported the
crystal structures of JMJD2A-nickel(II)-zinc(II) inhibitor complexes
bound to tri, di-, and monomethyl forms of H3K9 and the trimethyl form
of H3K36. The structures revealed a lysyl-binding pocket in which
substrates are bound in distinct bent conformations involving the
zinc-binding site. Ng et al. (2007) proposed a mechanism for achieving
methylation state selectivity involving the orientation of the substrate
methyl groups towards a ferryl intermediate. The results suggested
distinct recognition mechanisms in different demethylase subfamilies.

MAPPING

Ishikawa et al. (1998) mapped the JMJD2A gene to chromosome 1 by
radiation hybrid analysis. By genomic sequence analysis, Katoh and Katoh
(2004) mapped the JMJD2A gene to 1p34.1.

612061	TITLE *612061 ZINC FINGER AND RING FINGER PROTEIN 2; ZNRF2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching databases for genes similar to ZNRF1 (612060), Araki and
Milbrandt (2003) identified mouse and human ZNRF2. The deduced proteins
contain 238 and 242 amino acids, respectively, and both have a conserved
C-terminal region containing a zinc finger-RING finger motif. Human
ZNRF1 and ZNRF2 share 43% amino acid identity overall and 80% identity
in the conserved C-terminal region. RT-PCR detected high expression of
ZNRF2 in human fetal brain and lower expression in adult brain. Unlike
ZNRF1, ZNRF2 was also widely expressed in nonneural tissues, including
mammary gland, testis, colon, and kidney. In situ hybridization of mouse
pups and immunohistochemical analysis of adult mouse tissues revealed
Znrf2 expression throughout the central nervous system and in sensory
neurons of the peripheral nervous system. Znrf2 was expressed in mature
sperm, but not developing spermatogonia, as well as in adipose tissue,
columnar epithelia of the gut, and hair follicles. Immunohistochemical
analysis and fractionation of adult mouse brain localized Znrf1 and
Znrf2 to the presynaptic region, with Znrf1 on synaptic vesicles and
Znrf2 on presynaptic plasma membranes. In mouse fibroblasts,
fluorescence-tagged Znrf2 colocalized with an endosome/lysosome marker.

GENE FUNCTION

Using in vitro ubiquitination assays, Araki and Milbrandt (2003) showed
that ZNRF1 and ZNRF2 functioned as E3 ubiquitin ligases, but only when
UBC4 (UBE2D2; 602962) or UBCH5C (UBE2D3; 602963) were the E2
ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes. Mutation of a critical cysteine (cys184)
in the RING finger motifs of ZNRF1 and ZNRF2 inhibited Ca(2+)-dependent
exocytosis in transfected rat pheochromocytoma cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Araki and Milbrandt (2003) determined that the ZNRF2 gene contains 3
coding exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Araki and Milbrandt (2003) mapped the
ZNRF2 gene to chromosome 7p15.1.

611089	TITLE *611089 MYOTUBULARIN-RELATED PROTEIN 14; MTMR14
;;C3ORF29;;
EGG-DERIVED TYROSINE PHOSPHATASE, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF;;
HJUMPY
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The MTMR14 gene encodes a muscle-specific inositide phosphatase that
acts specifically on phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PI(3,5)P2),
and possibly other targets, and plays a critical role in skeletal muscle
calcium homeostasis and likely other cellular processes (summary by
Romero-Suarez et al., 2010).

CLONING

From a database screen for protein sequences similar to human
myotubularin (300415), which is mutated in a form of centronuclear
myopathy (CNMX; 310400), Tosch et al. (2006) identified a novel protein,
MTMR14, with high homology to Drosophila egg-derived tyrosine
phosphatase (EDTP). The authors called this protein hJUMPY because
disruption of EDTP protein function in Drosophila causes a phenotype
termed JUMPY: a muscle defect and a progressive loss of muscle control
together with shaky and slower movements. The deduced 650-amino acid
MTMR14 protein contains a predicted protein tyrosine phosphatase and
dual-specificity phosphatase (PTP/DSP) domain and the canonical C(X)5R
consensus present in active PTP/DSPs. The MTMR14 catalytic loop shows
closest resemblance to that of active myotubularins. Northern blot
analysis detected a 2.5-kb MTMR14 transcript with highest expression in
skeletal muscle and heart and lower expression in placenta, kidney,
liver, pancreas, and lung. Immunofluorescence studies showed that MTMR14
localizes to cytoplasmic reticular structures and plasma membrane
ruffles, and displays a concentration near the nucleus of COS-1 cells.
MTMR14 was more concentrated in structures positive for giantin
(602500), a Golgi marker.

Shen et al. (2009) identified the MTMR14 protein as a phosphatase
predominantly expressed in skeletal and heart muscle. The human and
mouse proteins share 90% amino acid sequence homology.

GENE FUNCTION

By quantitative PCR in mice, Tosch et al. (2006) showed that expression
of Mtmr14 increased with C2C12 myotubule formation and differentiation
in culture. Using in vitro and ex vivo approaches, Tosch et al. (2006)
demonstrated that MTMR14 is a PPIn 3-phosphatase that dephosphorylates
the same substrates as myotubularin, PtdIns(3)P and PtdIns(3,5)P2.

Shen et al. (2009) also demonstrated that MTMR14 dephosphorylates a
variety of PtdInsPs, particularly PtdIns(3,5)P2.

GENE STRUCTURE

Tosch et al. (2006) determined that the MTMR14 gene contains 19 exons;
EST database analysis indicated that exons 17 and 18 are alternatives.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Tosch et al. (2006) mapped the MTMR14 gene
to chromosome 3p25.3.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Tosch et al. (2006) described 2 sporadic cases of centronuclear myopathy
in which each proband carried a heterozygous missense mutation in the
MTMR14 gene. The first proband and his unaffected father carried an
R336Q substitution (611089.0001). A second mutant allele was postulated,
but not identified. The other proband carried a Y462C substitution in
MTMR14 (611089.0002) and an additional missense mutation in DYN2 (E368K;
602378.0007), consistent with autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy
(160150). The Y462C mutation was also found in a control individual.
Both variants impaired enzymatic function, the R336Q mutation strongly
and the Y462C mutation to a lesser extent. Tosch et al. (2006) remarked
that myotubular myopathy patients with other characterized mutations in
DYN2 usually have an age of onset in childhood or adulthood, whereas the
age of onset in their patient was neonatal. The report raised the
possibility of MTMR14 being a modifier of the phenotype in some cases of
centronuclear myopathy.

ANIMAL MODEL

Shen et al. (2009) found that Mtmr14-null mice had muscle weakness and
increased fatigue with exercise. Isolated muscles from mutant mice
showed decreased contractile force, exacerbated fatigue, and prolonged
relaxation compared to muscle from wildtype mice. Mtmr14 deficiency
resulted in increased elevated resting calcium levels in myotubes due to
spontaneous calcium leakage from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This
leakage was attributed to decreased activity of Mtmr14 phosphatase
activity and accumulation of substrates, especially PtdIns(3,5)P2 and
PtdIns(3,4)P2. In addition, PtdIns(3,5)P2 and PtdIns(3,4)P2 bound to and
directly activated the RYR1 (180901) calcium release channel in the
sarcoplasmic reticulum. The findings indicated that fine control of
PtdInsP levels in muscle cells is essential for maintaining calcium
homeostasis and muscle performance.

Normal aging is associated with sarcopenia, or a decrease in muscle mass
and function. Romero-Suarez et al. (2010) found that Mtmr14-null mice
manifested features of sarcopenia much earlier (12 to 14 months)
compared to wildtype mice (22 to 24 months). In particular, young and
mature mutant mice behaved like old wildtype mice, indicating earlier
onset of locomotor dysfunction in mutant mice. These changes were
associated with muscle atrophy and a decrease in contractile force and
power in the muscles of mutant mice. Wildtype mice showed downregulation
of Mtmr14 during normal aging, and muscle tissue from both old wildtype
and mutant mature mice showed dysfunctional calcium homeostasis, with
increased resting calcium levels and decreased calcium release from the
sarcoplasmic reticulum when triggered. The findings indicated that
Mtmr14 is a potent regulator of skeletal muscle function under normal
conditions and that its downregulation may contribute to age-related
sarcopenia. Romero-Suarez et al. (2010) concluded that loss of Mtmr14
results in altered PtdIns(3,5)P2 signaling, as well as altered calcium
signaling, which can affect a variety of cell processes.

Dowling et al. (2010) examined zebrafish MTMR14 using gene dosage
manipulation. As with MTM1 (300415) knockdown, morpholino-mediated
knockdown of MTMR14 resulted in morphologic abnormalities, a
developmental motor phenotype characterized by diminished spontaneous
contractions and abnormal escape response, and impaired
excitation-contraction coupling. In contrast to MTM1 knockdown, however,
muscle ultrastructure was unaffected. Double knockdown of MTM1 and
MTMR14 significantly impaired motor function and altered skeletal muscle
ultrastructure. The combined effect of reducing levels of both MTMR14
and MTM1 was significantly more severe than either knockdown alone, an
effect which may be mediated by increased autophagy. The authors
concluded that MTMR14 is required for motor function and, in combination
with MTM1, is required for myocyte homeostasis and normal embryonic
development.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MYOPATHY, CENTRONUCLEAR, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT, MODIFIER OF
MTMR14, ARG336GLN

Tosch et al. (2006) reported a 12-year old Brazilian boy with
centronuclear myopathy (160150) who presented with neonatal hypotonia,
proximal muscle weakness, and ophthalmoparesis. Both he and his
clinically unaffected father were heterozygous for a 1007G-A transition
in exon 11 of the MTMR14 gene. The mutation was predicted to result in
an arg336-to-gln (R336Q) substitution in a highly conserved region of
the active site of the protein. The mutation was not found in 820
control chromosomes. Immunoprecipitation assays detected a strong
decrease in the phosphatase activity of the R336Q mutant, 22% of the
level of wildtype. A second mutation in MTMR14 was not identified, and
the patient did not have a mutation in exons or splice sites of the DNM2
gene (602378). Tosch et al. (2006) hypothesized that another mutant
allele in either the MTMR14 gene or in another gene must be present.

.0002

MTMR14, TYR462CYS

Tosch et al. (2006) reported a 36-year-old woman with centronuclear
myopathy-1 (160150) caused by a heterozygous missense mutation in the
DNM2 gene (E368K; 602378.0007) who also carried a heterozygous 1385A-G
transition in exon 16 of the MTMR14 gene, resulting in a tyr462-to-cys
(Y462C) substitution in a semiconserved region outside of the active
site of the protein. The Y462C mutation was found in 1 of 700 Brazilian
control chromosomes. The Y462C mutant displayed 80% of the phosphatase
activity of the wildtype protein in immunoprecipitation assays. Both
mutations occurred de novo. The patient presented with neonatal
hypotonia, muscle weakness, and ophthalmoparesis. The report raised the
possibility of MTMR14 being a modifier of the phenotype in some cases of
centronuclear myopathy.

138180	TITLE *138180 GLUTAMATE OXALOACETATE TRANSAMINASE, SOLUBLE; GOT1
;;ASPARTATE AMINOTRANSFERASE, CYTOSOLIC
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (EC 2.6.1.1) is a ubiquitous
pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzyme which exists in both mitochondrial
(138150) and cytosolic forms. The enzyme plays an important role in
amino acid metabolism and in the urea and tricarboxylic acid cycles. The
2 isoenzymes are homodimeric. In liver about 80% of the enzyme activity
is mitochondrial in origin, whereas in serum the enzyme activity is
largely cytosolic. Although the mitochondrial and soluble forms of GOT
are coded by different chromosomes (according to a rule that has few
exceptions; McKusick, 1986), the 2 show close homology in amino acid
sequence and were presumably derived from a common ancestral gene (Ford
et al., 1980; Doonan et al., 1984).

See ASTQTL1 (614419) for information on a quantitative trait locus
influencing the serum level of cytosolic glutamate oxaloacetate
transaminase.

CLONING

Pol et al. (1988) cloned cDNAs corresponding to human liver cytosolic
and mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase mRNAs.

GENE STRUCTURE

Wang et al. (1999) determined the genomic structure of the GOT1 gene.
The gene contains 9 exons and all of its intron/exon junctions follow
the GT-AG rule.

GENE FUNCTION

Son et al. (2013) reported the identification of a noncanonical pathway
of glutamine use in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC; see
260350) cells that is required for tumor growth. Whereas most cells use
glutamate dehydrogenase (GLUD1; 138130) to convert glutamine-derived
glutamate into alpha-ketoglutarate in the mitochondria to fuel the
tricarboxylic acid cycle, PDAC relies on a distinct pathway in which
glutamine-derived aspartate is transported into the cytoplasm where it
can be converted into oxaloacetate by aspartate transaminase (GOT1).
Subsequently, this oxaloacetate is converted into malate and then
pyruvate, ostensibly increasing the NADPH/NADP+ ratio which can
potentially maintain the cellular redox state. Importantly, PDAC cells
are strongly dependent on this series of reactions, as glutamine
deprivation or genetic inhibition of any enzyme in this pathway leads to
an increase in reactive oxygen species and a reduction in reduced
glutathione. Moreover, knockdown of any component enzyme in this series
of reactions also results in a pronounced suppression of PDAC growth in
vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, Son et al. (2013) established that the
reprogramming of glutamine metabolism is mediated by oncogenic KRAS
(190070), the signature genetic alteration in PDAC, through the
transcriptional upregulation and repression of key metabolic enzymes in
this pathway.

MAPPING

By analysis of mouse-human somatic cell hybrids, Creagan et al. (1973)
concluded that the structural locus for cytoplasmic glutamate
oxaloacetate transaminase is on chromosome 10.

Spritz et al. (1979) studied soluble GOT activity in fibroblasts of 2
persons with duplications of the long arm of chromosome 10. Since the 2
differed by only half a band, the authors concluded that the structural
locus is on band 10q24.

Junien et al. (1982) assigned GOT1 and PGAMA (172250) to 10q26.1 (or
10q25.3) by dosage studies.

Pol et al. (1989) used human liver cytosolic and mitochondrial aspartate
aminotransferase cDNA probes to locate the GOT1 gene in the region
10q24.1-q25.1 by in situ hybridization. Wang et al. (1999) located the
GOT1 gene within the critical region for the urofacial syndrome
(236730), between markers D10S198 and D10S2494, but excluded it as a
candidate for that disorder by mutation analysis.

Koch et al. (1981) pointed out that GOT1 and LIPA (278000) are also
syntenic on chromosome 19 of the mouse.

OTHER FEATURES

Panteghini (1990) reviewed the clinical usefulness of assays for
aspartate aminotransferase (AST) isoenzymes in serum.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Data on gene frequencies of allelic variants were tabulated by
Roychoudhury and Nei (1988).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
ASPARTATE AMINOTRANSFERASE, REDUCED SERUM LEVEL OF
GOT1, ASN389 DEL

In 10 Amish individuals, Shen et al. (2011) identified a 3-nucleotide
deletion in the GOT1 gene, 1165_1167delAAC, resulting in a deletion of
asparagine at position 389. Deletion carriers had significantly lower
AST activity levels (614419) compared with homozygous deletion
noncarriers (mean +/- SD: 10.0 +/- 2.8 vs 18.8 +/- 5.2 microliter; p =
2.80 x 10(-14)). Mutant cAST protein was barely detectable in cells in
in vitro transient transfection assays of wildtype and mutant cAST. This
mutation had a minor allele frequency of 0.0052 among the Old Order
Amish but was not detected in 647 outbred Caucasians. All deletion
carriers could be traced back to one most likely founder who was born in
the mid-18th century. Shen et al. (2011) found no association between
deletion and metabolic traits including serum fasting glucose or
insulin, fasting and postmeal lipids, inflammatory markers, or
subclinical markers of cardiovascular disease.

615347	TITLE *615347 ATPase FAMILY, AAA DOMAIN-CONTAINING, MEMBER 2B; ATAD2B
;;KIAA1240
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated human fetal brain
cDNA library, Nagase et al. (1999) obtained a partial ATAD2B clone,
which they designated KIAA1240. RT-PCR ELISA detected ATAD2B expression
in all adult and fetal tissues examined, except testis. Highest
expression was found in adult subthalamic nuclei, low expression was
found in adult skeletal muscle, pancreas, spleen, and fetal brain, and
intermediate expression was found in all other tissues, including other
specific brain regions.

Leachman et al. (2010) reported that full-length ATAD2B contains 1,458
amino acids and has a calculated molecular mass of 165 kD. ATAD2B
contains an AAA domain in its N-terminal half and a bromodomain in its
C-terminal half. The AAA domain of ATAD2B is highly conserved and shares
97% and 93% identity with the AAA domain of ATAD2 (611941) and the sea
squirt ortholog, respectively. The bromodomains of ATAD2B and ATAD2 are
considerably less well conserved. Immunohistochemical and Western blot
analysis of developing chicken neural tissues revealed transient and
stage-specific upregulation of Atad2b in several regions, including
spinal cord, dorsal root ganglia, retina, telencephalon, forebrain, and
cerebellum. Anti-ATAD2B staining was predominantly found in neural cell
nuclei; a smaller proportion was also detected in membrane preparations.
In human glioblastoma, oligodendroglioma, and breast carcinoma, staining
was predominantly cytoplasmic.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1999) mapped the ATAD2B
gene to chromosome 2. Hartz (2013) mapped the ATAD2B gene to chromosome
2p24.1-p23.3 based on an alignment of the ATAD2B sequence (GenBank
GENBANK AB033066) with the genomic sequence (GRCh37).

602372	TITLE *602372 ZONADHESIN; ZAN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Zonadhesin (ZAN) is a sperm membrane protein that binds the zona
pellucida of the egg in a species-specific manner. Gao et al. (1997)
cloned a partial-length ZAN cDNA by directly screening a human testis
cDNA library with a pig Zan cDNA.

GENE STRUCTURE

Gasper and Swanson (2006) stated that the ZAN gene comprises 47 coding
exons.

GENE FUNCTION

Gasper and Swanson (2006) summarized the mammalian fertilization
cascade, many steps of which exhibit species specificity (Vacquier,
1998). For example, the sperm first bind in a species-specific manner
with the zona pellucida, the extracellular coat of the egg (Wassarman et
al., 2001). In general, when eggs and sperm come from heterospecific
species, the initial binding to the zona pellucida does not occur as
efficiently as in homospecific mixtures. Once bound, the acrosomal
reaction is triggered, involving exocytosis of the acrosome, creating an
acrosomal shroud. Next, the sperm penetrates the egg zona pellucida,
enters the perivitelline space between the zona pellucida and the plasma
membrane, and then fuses with the plasma membrane. The zonadhesin
protein, encoded by the ZAN gene, localizes to the anterior part of the
sperm head and acts as a receptor to the zona pellucida matrix of the
egg. Like other male reproductive proteins located in the acrosome or
sperm head and proposed to be involved in species-specific binding to
eggs, ZAN possesses high levels of divergence between closely related
species.

MAPPING

Gao et al. (1997) mapped the human ZAN gene to 7q22 by fluorescence in
situ hybridization and the mouse Zan gene to chromosome 5 by
interspecific backcross analysis. Since the ZP3A (182889) gene is also
located on chromosome 7, Gao et al. (1997) speculated that a chromosomal
linkage of various fertilization-specific molecules might exist.

EVOLUTION

Gasper and Swanson (2006) sequenced 47 coding exons of the ZAN gene in
12 primate species and showed that 3 domains of the gene are under
positive selection and rapidly evolving, and thus may be involved in
binding to the zona pellucida in a species-specific manner in primates.
Polymorphism data from 48 humans revealed significant
polymorphism-to-divergence heterogeneity and significant departure from
equilibrium-neutral expectations in the frequency spectrum, suggesting
balancing selection and positive selection occurring in zonadhesin
within human populations.

;;SULFOTRANSFERASE, PHENOL-PREFERRING 2; STP2;;
PHENOL SULFOTRANSFERASE 2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Her et al. (1996) and Dooley and Huang (1996) reported the sequence of
the SULT1A2 gene.

GENE STRUCTURE

Sulfonation is an important pathway in the biotransformation of many
drugs, xenobiotics, neurotransmitters, and steroid hormones. The
thermostable form of phenol sulfotransferase preferentially catalyzes
the sulfonation of 'simple' planar phenols. The phenol sulfotransferase
STP1 (171150) maps to chromosome 16. Her et al. (1996) determined the
structure and chromosomal localization of the gene encoding a second
phenol sulfotransferase, STP2. The gene spans approximately 5.1 kb and
contains 9 exons that range in length from 74 to 347 bp. Exons 1A and 1B
as well as the 5-prime portion of exon 2 and the 3-prime portion of exon
8 are noncoding. The locations of most STP2 exon/intron splice junctions
are identical to those of a gene for the thermolabile form of PST in
humans, STM (600641), which maps to 16p close to the location of the
thermostable STP1.

Dooley and Huang (1996) determined that 7 coding exons are conserved
among the human STP1, STP2, and STM (600641) genes. The initiator
methionine is found on exon 2. All 3 genes colocalized on a single
cosmid from chromosome 16p12.1-p11.2 and have a high degree of sequence
homology, suggesting that these 3 genes arose by gene duplication.
Dooley and Huang (1996) stated that the previously identified PST gene
sequences HAST4, HAST4v, and ST1A2 are isolates of the STP2 gene.

MAPPING

Her et al. (1996) mapped STP2 to human chromosome 16 by PCR with DNA
from human/rodent somatic cell hybrids.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CBFA2T3 belongs to a family of ubiquitously expressed transcriptional
repressors that interact with transcription factors bound to promoters
of target genes and with histone deacetylases (HDACs; see 601241)
critical for enforcement of repressor function (summary by Kumar et al.,
2008).

CLONING

MTG8 (133435) and CBFA2 (AML1; 151385) are the 2 loci involved in the
t(8;21)(q22;q22) translocation, one of the most common translocations in
acute myeloid leukemia. The MTG8 protein is related to the product of
the Drosophila 'nervy' gene, a target of the homeotic gene
'Ultrabithorax.' By screening human and mouse libraries with an MTG8
probe, Calabi and Cilli (1998) isolated human and mouse MTGR1 (CBFA2T2;
603672) cDNAs and the human genomic region of a novel gene, MTGR2. The
predicted MTGR2 protein shares 92% and 85% sequence identity with MTG8
and MTGR1, respectively.

The t(16;21)(q24;q22) translocation is a rare but recurrent chromosomal
abnormality associated with therapy-related myeloid malignancies. Gamou
et al. (1998) identified MTG16 as the partner gene of AML1 in leukemic
cells with a t(16;21)(q24;q22) translocation. The authors isolated cDNAs
for 2 MTG16 splice variants, MTG16A and MTG16B, that use alternate first
exons. MTG16A uses exon 1A and encodes a predicted 653-amino acid
protein. MTG16B uses exon 1B and lacks exon 3, and it encodes a
predicted 567-amino acid protein. Like MTG8 and MTGR1, both MTG16
isoforms contain 4 conserved regions termed NHRs (nervy homology
regions). NHR4 is a zinc finger domain. Both isoforms also contain
proline/serine/threonine-rich (PST) regions at the N terminus, C
terminus, and between NHR1 and NHR2. Northern blot analysis revealed
that MTG16 was expressed as multiple transcripts in a tissue-specific
pattern. Highest expression was detected in pancreas, thymus, and
peripheral blood leukocytes, and lowest expression was detected in
kidney and ovary.

GENE STRUCTURE

Gamou et al. (1998) determined that the MTG16 gene contains 13 exons,
including alternative first exons 1A and 1B, and spans more than 73 kb.

MAPPING

By analysis of a radiation hybrid panel, Calabi and Cilli (1998) mapped
the MTGR2 gene to 16q24. Gamou et al. (1998) confirmed the localization
by fluorescence in situ hybridization. By genomic sequence analysis,
Powell et al. (2002) mapped the CBFA2T3 gene to chromosome 16q24.3.

GENE FUNCTION

By screening peripheral blood T cells for A-kinase anchor proteins
(AKAPs) with an RII (see RII-alpha; 176910) overlay assay and with a
cAMP pull-down assay, followed by Western blot analysis, Schillace et
al. (2002) identified AKAP149 (AKAP1; 602449), AKAP79 (AKAP5; 604688),
AKAP95 (AKAP8; 604692), and WAVE (WASF1; 605035). Screening of a
stimulated Jurkat library with the RII overlay assay led to the
isolation of MTG16B. Binding and mutational analysis at position 408
indicated that residues 344 to 432 of MTG16B interact with RII-alpha,
coinciding with the predicted binding site of amino acids 399 to 420.
Coimmunoprecipitation analysis and confocal microscopy demonstrated a
brefeldin A-sensitive association of RII-alpha and MTG16B in the Golgi
of Jurkat cells.

TAL1 (187040) is necessary for establishment of the hematopoietic system
and can either activate or repress transcription depending upon other
factors recruited to TAL1-nucleated complexes. Goardon et al. (2006)
found that ETO2 copurified with TAL1 complexes in human and mouse
erythroleukemia cells. Protein pull-down assays revealed that ETO2
interacted with E2A (TCF3; 147141) and HEB (TCF12; 600480) within the
TAL1 complex, but not with TAL1 itself. ETO2 also interacted with E2A in
erythroid cells independent of the TAL1 complex. Reporter gene assays
revealed that ETO2 repressed the transcriptional activity of the
complex. The ETO2 content in TAL1 complexes was high during the
proliferative phase in erythroid cells. In contrast, ETO2 was
downregulated upon terminal differentiation, concomitant with appearance
of histone modifications associated with gene activation and expression
of glycophorin A (GPA; 111300) and band 4.2 (EPB42; 177070), which are
markers of erythrocyte maturation. Knockdown of ETO2 via small
interfering RNA induced growth arrest and differentiation in human and
mouse erythroid progenitors. Goardon et al. (2006) concluded that ETO2
is required for expansion of erythroid progenitors, but that it is
dispensable for terminal maturation. They proposed that the
stoichiometry of ETO2 with the TAL1 complex controls the transition from
erythroid progenitor expansion to terminal differentiation.

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis of a human breast cDNA library and
immunoprecipitation analysis of cotransfected HEK293T cells, Kumar et
al. (2006) showed that ZNF652 (613907) interacted with CBFA2T3. Deletion
analysis revealed that the C-terminal 109-amino acids of ZNF652 were
required for the interaction, and inclusion of the ZNF652 central zinc
finger domain stabilized the interaction. Reporter gene assays showed
that ZNF652 functioned as a transcriptional repressor. CBFA2T3 enhanced
the repressor activity of ZNF652 in a dose-dependent manner.

Kumar et al. (2008) found that ZNF652 alone or in complex with CBFA2T3
bound the consensus ZNF652 response element (AAGGGTTAA) found in the
promoter region of the HEB gene. In HEK293T cells, which express
endogenous ZNF652 and CBFA2T3, overexpression of either protein
repressed HEB expression, and repression was enhanced by coexpression of
both ZNF652 and CBFA2T3. Mutation analysis revealed that the NHR3 and
NHR4 motifs of CBFA2T3 interacted with the proline-rich stretch in the C
terminus of ZNF652.

Moore et al. (2008) showed that epitope-tagged mammalian Mtgr1, Mtg8,
and Mtg16 interacted with human TCF4 (TCF7L2; 602228) in cotransfected
COS-7 cells. The Wnt signaling protein beta-catenin (CTNNB1; 116806)
disrupted interaction of Mtg proteins with TCF4. When expressed in
Xenopus embryos, Mtg family members inhibited Wnt-dependent axis
formation and impaired the ability of beta-catenin or Lef1 (153245) to
induce axis duplication. Furthermore, Myc (190080), a transcriptional
target of the Wnt pathway, was overexpressed in the small intestine of
mice lacking Mtgr1. Moore et al. (2008) concluded that MTG proteins act
downstream of beta-catenin in the Wnt signaling pathway.

Notch receptor (see 190198) signaling regulates gene expression for
specification of cell fate in diverse tissues during development and
adult tissue renewal. In response to ligand binding, the intracellular
domain (ICD) of Notch is proteolytically released by the gamma-secretase
complex (see 104311) and translocates to the nucleus, where it binds CSL
(RBPJ; 147183) and triggers its conversion from a repressor to an
activator of Notch target gene expression. Engel et al. (2010) found
that Mtg16 -/- mouse hematopoietic progenitor cells showed elevated
expression of Notch targets, in addition to impaired differentiation, in
response to Notch signaling. The defect was reversed by restoration of
Mtg16 expression. Using mouse and human cells, Engel et al. (2010)
showed that all MTG family proteins bound CSL and that MTG16 bound the
ICDs of all Notch receptor proteins. Binding of MTG16 to Notch ICD
disrupted MTG16-CSL and MTG16-NCOR (see 600849) interactions and
permitted Notch signaling. Mutation and coprecipitation analysis
revealed that the N-terminal PST region of MTG16 interacted directly
with Notch ICD and that binding was independent of the MTG16 NTR domains
required for DNA, CSL, and HDAC binding. The PST region of Mtg16 was
also essential for Mtg16-dependent lineage specification in mouse
hematopoietic progenitor cells. Engel et al.(2010) concluded that MTG16
is an integral component of Notch signaling that contributes to basal
repression of canonical Notch target genes.

CYTOGENETICS

The t(16;21)(q24;q22) translocation is a rare but recurrent chromosomal
abnormality associated with therapy-related myeloid malignancies and a
variant of the t(8;21) translocation in which the AML1 gene on
chromosome 21 is rearranged. Gamou et al. (1998) determined that, as in
t(8;21), the t(16;21) breakpoints occurred between exons 5 and 6 of AML1
and between exons 1 and 2 or exons 3 and 4 of MTG16. Using RT-PCR, they
detected the AML1-MTG16 chimeric transcript in all 4 t(16;21) patients
tested. The reciprocal MTG16-AML1 mRNA was present in only 1 patient and
its predicted product was truncated, suggesting that AML1-MTG16 rather
than MTG16-AML1 is involved in the pathogenesis of t(16;21) leukemia.
The AML1-MTG16 chimeric protein shares several structural features with
AML1-MTG8, including the presence of the AML1 runt domain and the 4
NHRs.

ANIMAL MODEL

Chyla et al. (2008) deleted the Mtg16 gene in mice on a mixed genetic
background. Mtg16 -/- mice were obtained at the expected frequency, were
fertile, and appeared normal. However, some Mtg16 -/- mice showed mild
anemia and compensatory reticulocytosis at 4 weeks of age. Histologic
examination of Mtg16 -/- mice revealed disruption in splenic
architecture, with excess lymphoid, myeloid, erythroid, and
megakaryocytic elements, consistent with extramedullary hematopoiesis.
Bone marrow of Mtg16 -/- mice also showed disruption of lineage
allocation, with fewer maturing erythroid progenitors and increased
granulocyte lineage. Exposure to phenylhydrazine, a hemolytic agent,
resulted in rapid loss of hematocrit and death in Mtg16 -/- mice, but
not in wildtype mice. Death in Mtg16 -/- mice appeared to be due to
failure to expand erythropoiesis in spleen. Microarray analysis revealed
misregulation of numerous genes associated with stem and progenitor cell
function in Mtg16 -/- mice. Examination of in vivo colony formation
revealed that Mtg16 -/- progenitors found their way to spleen but failed
to expand to form colonies. Reexpression of Mtg16 complemented the
proliferation defect, as did expression of Myc. Chyla et al. (2008)
concluded that inactivation of Mtg16 caused a profound defect in
hematopoietic progenitor cell expansion.

603916	TITLE *603916 EUKARYOTIC TRANSLATION INITIATION FACTOR 3, SUBUNIT C; EIF3C
;;EIF3-p110;;
EUKARYOTIC TRANSLATION INITIATION FACTOR 3, SUBUNIT 8, FORMERLY; EIF3S8,
FORMERLY
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Eukaryotic initiation factor-3 (eIF3) is the largest of the eIFs and
consists of at least 10 nonidentical subunits, including EIF2C (Asano et
al., 1997).

CLONING

Asano et al. (1997) demonstrated that the 115-kD component of HeLa cell
eIF3 is actually composed of 2 proteins, p116 (PRT1; 603917) and p110.
By screening a HeLa cell expression library with antibodies against the
115-kD band, these authors identified cDNAs encoding p110. The predicted
913-amino acid p110 protein has a pI of 5.8 and is unrelated to p116.
p110 shares 31% identity to the S. cerevisiae Nip1 protein, which is
thought to be involved in nuclear import and the initiation phase of
protein synthesis. Asano et al. (1997) found that the p116, p110, and
p36 (603911) subunits localize on 40S ribosomes in cells active in
translation and coimmunoprecipitate with p170 (602039), indicating that
these proteins are integral components of eIF3. Northern blot analysis
revealed that p110 is expressed as a 3-kb mRNA.

GENE FUNCTION

By reciprocal yeast 2-hybrid and coimmunoprecipitation analyses of the
human STS26T malignant schwannoma cell line, Scoles et al. (2006) showed
that isoforms 1 and 2 of schwannomin (NF2; 607379) interacted with
EIF3C. Mutation analysis revealed that the FERM domain of schwannomin
interacted with the C-terminal half of EIF3C. Immunofluorescence
microscopy of STS26T cells showed that the 2 proteins partly colocalized
at punctate perinuclear structures and at some membranous structures.
Overexpression of EIF3C in STS26T cells elevated cell proliferation, and
schwannomin countered this effect. Western blot analysis revealed an
inverse abundance of schwannomin and EIF3C in human meningiomas.

MAPPING

Gross (2011) mapped the EIF3C gene to chromosome 16p11.2 based on an
alignment of the EIF3C sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC000533) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37). A nearly identical copy of EIF3C, designated
EIF3CL, also maps to chromosome 16p11.2.

154582	TITLE *154582 MANNOSIDASE, ALPHA, CLASS 2A, MEMBER 1; MAN2A1
;;MANNOSIDASE, ALPHA, II; MANA2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Alpha-mannosidase II (EC 3.2.1.114) is a Golgi enzyme that catalyzes the
final hydrolytic step in the asparagine-linked oligosaccharide
(N-glycan) maturation pathway, acting as the committed step in the
conversion of high mannose to complex type structures. Misago et al.
(1995) noted that lysosomal alpha-mannosidases (609458) are soluble and
involved in degradation of N-glycans. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and
Golgi alpha-mannosidases are involved in processing of newly synthesized
N-glycans. Cytoplasmic alpha-mannosidases (154580) may be involved in
degradation of dolichol intermediates that are not needed for protein
glycosylation or oligosaccharides derived from glycoprotein turnover in
the ER. Alpha-mannosidase II is a type II membrane protein residing
mainly in the medial Golgi cisternae.

CLONING

Moremen and Robbins (1991) isolated cDNAs encoding the murine enzyme and
also isolated partial human alpha-mannosidase II cDNA clones.

Misago et al. (1995) cloned the human MANA2 gene and reported genomic
and cDNA cloning of a MANA2 isozyme designated alpha-mannosidase IIX
(MANA2X, or MAN2A2; 600988). Whereas the MANA2 gene predicted a protein
of 1,144 amino acid residues, the MANA2X gene was predicted to encode a
truncated polypeptide with 796 amino acid residues. Comparison of the
sequence of PCR products with the MANA2X genomic sequence revealed that
alternative splicing of the transcript can result in an additional
transcript encoding a 1,139-amino acid polypeptide.

MAPPING

Moremen and Robbins (1991) localized the MANA2 gene to human chromosome
5 by study of human/rodent somatic cell hybrids. By isotopic in situ
hybridization, Misago et al. (1995) mapped the MANA2 gene to 5q21-q22
and the MANA2X gene to 15q25.

ANIMAL MODEL

Alpha-mannosidase II catalyzes the first committed step in the
biosynthesis of complex N-glycans. Genetic deficiency of this enzyme
should abolish complex N-glycan production as reportedly does inhibition
of the enzyme by swainsonine. Chui et al. (1997) found that mice in whom
the alpha-mannosidase II gene had been disrupted developed a
dyserythropoietic anemia concurrent with loss of erythrocyte complex
N-glycans. Unexpectedly, nonerythroid cell types continued to produce
complex N-glycans by an alternate pathway comprising a distinct
alpha-mannosidase. These studies revealed cell type-specific variations
in N-linked oligosaccharide biosynthesis and an essential role for
alpha-mannosidase II in the formation of erythroid complex N-glycans.
Alpha-mannosidase II deficiency elicited a phenotype in mice that
corresponds to human congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type II
(224100).

Protein glycosylation in the Golgi apparatus produces structural
variation at the cell surface and contributes to immune
self-recognition. Altered protein glycosylation and antibodies that
recognize endogenous glycans have been associated with various
autoimmune syndromes, with the possibility that such abnormalities may
reflect genetic defects in glycan formation. Studying mice with a null
allele for alpha-mannosidase II, Chui et al. (2001) showed that mutation
in this gene, which regulates the hybrid to complex branching pattern of
extracellular asparagine (N)-linked oligosaccharide chains (N-glycans),
results in a systemic autoimmune disease similar to human systemic lupus
erythematosus (152700). The findings demonstrated a genetic cause of
autoimmune disease provoked by a defect in the pathway of protein
N-glycosylation.

Akama et al. (2006) produced Man2a1 and Man2a2 double-knockout mice.
Some double-null mice died between embryonic days 15.5 and 18.5, but
most survived until shortly after birth and died of respiratory failure.
Recombinant mouse Man2a1 and Man2a2 showed identical substrate
specificities toward N-glycan substrates, suggesting that either can
biochemically compensate for deficiency of the other in vivo.

123670	TITLE *123670 CRYSTALLIN, GAMMA-B; CRYGB
;;CRYSTALLIN, GAMMA-2; CRYG2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Crystallin proteins (alpha, beta, and gamma) account for more than 90%
of total lens proteins. Different gamma-crystallin isoforms account for
approximately one-third of total lens proteins (Bloemendal et al.,
2004).

CLONING

Den Dunnen et al. (1985) isolated a genomic cosmid clone containing 2
closely linked gamma-crystallin genes, CRYGB and CRYGC (123680),
oriented in the same direction. They sequenced the coding regions of the
genes as well as their 5-prime and 3-prime flanking regions. The genes
share 80% homology.

MAPPING

Shiloh et al. (1986) mapped a human gamma-crystallin gene cluster,
including CRYGB, to chromosome 2q33-q36.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a 3-generation Kuwaiti family segregating autosomal dominant
congenital cataracts of multiple types mapping to chromosome 2q33-q37
(CTRCT39; 615188), AlFadhli et al. (2012) screened the 4 candidate
gamma-crystallin genes, CRYGA (123660), CRYGB, CRYGC, and CRYGD
(123690), and identified 2 different mutations in the CRYGB gene, each
with an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. The first was a 1-bp
deletion in exon 2 (123670.0001) that segregated with anterior polar
cataracts, and the other was a 1-bp intronic deletion (123670.0002) that
segregated with the lamellar cataract phenotype. One family member, who
was compound heterozygous for both mutations, exhibited complete
cataracts. Neither mutation was found in 50 age-, gender-, and
ethnicity-matched controls. A 3-SNP polymorphism (20_22GGT-AAA) was also
detected in 3 family members, including 1 unaffected individual, 1 with
lamellar cataract, and 1 with anterior polar cataract. The polymorphism
was not detected in the 50 controls, and AlFadhli et al. (2012) stated
that it was considered unlikely to be involved in cataractogenesis.

ANIMAL MODEL

Li et al. (2008) identified a heterozygous ser11-to-arg mutation in the
Crygb gene in mice, which specifically altered the subcellular
distribution of gamma-crystallin in mature fiber cells and led to
cellular and biochemical changes that resulted in a dense nuclear
cataract. The authors stated that their findings supported the
hypothesis that mutant crystallins can cause cataracts by selectively
perturbing protein-protein interactions, distinct cellular events during
fiber cell maturation, or specific cellular structures of the lens
mature fibers.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CATARACT 39, MULTIPLE TYPES
CRYGB, 1-BP DEL, 167C

In a 3-generation Kuwaiti family with autosomal dominant congenital
cataracts of multiple types (CTRCT39; 615188), AlFadhli et al. (2012)
identified 2 different mutations in the CRYGB gene, each with an
autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. The first was a 1-bp deletion
(167delC) in exon 2, causing a frameshift predicted to result in
premature termination, that segregated with anterior polar cataracts and
was maternally inherited from the grandmother, who was of Egyptian
origin. The other was a 1-bp intronic deletion (67delG; 123670.0002)
that segregated with the lamellar cataract phenotype, and was paternally
inherited from the Kuwaiti grandfather. One family member, who was
compound heterozygous for both mutations, exhibited complete cataracts.
The mutations were not found in unaffected family members, except for
the presence of the 67delG mutation in a female infant who had not yet
shown signs of cataracts. Neither mutation was found in 50 age-,
gender-, and ethnicity-matched controls.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

LIM proteins, named for 'LIN11, ISL1, and MEC3,' are defined by the
possession of a highly conserved double zinc finger motif called the LIM
domain.

CLONING

Morgan et al. (1995) identified a partial human SLIM1 cDNA. They found
that SLIM1 is a developmentally regulated protein that is expressed in
human skeletal muscle but not in a variety of other tissues. By
searching sequence databases with the partial SLIM1 cDNA isolated by
Morgan et al. (1995), Morgan and Madgwick (1996) identified human cDNAs
encoding the complete SLIM1 amino acid sequence. The predicted 280-amino
acid protein contains 4 LIM domains and a novel single zinc finger
domain in the N-terminal region. By Northern blot analysis, SLIM1 is
expressed as a 2.3-kb mRNA in human masseter muscle.

By Northern blot analysis, Greene et al. (1999) found a 2.5-kb
transcript strongly expressed in skeletal muscle and to a lesser extent
in heart. Significantly lower expression was observed in prostate,
testis, ovary, small and large intestine, placenta, and lung, while
barely detectable expression was seen in spleen, thymus, and pancreas.
No expression was detected in leukocytes, brain, liver, and kidney. A
second transcript of about 1.3-kb was found at low levels in testis,
heart, and skeletal muscle.

Using a sequence derived from the 5-prime end of inositol polyphosphate
5-phosphatase (INPP5A; 600106) as a probe, Brown et al. (1999) cloned
FHL1, which they called SLIM1, from a bone marrow cDNA library. Sequence
analysis revealed that each LIM domain is separated by 8 intervening
amino acids. SLIM1 shares 47% sequence identity with SLIM3 (FHL2;
602633) and 45% identity with SLIM2 (FHL3; 602790). SLIM1 shares no
homology with INPP5A except for a 16-nucleotide stretch contained within
the probe used to screen the library.

Brown et al. (1999) also cloned an alternatively spliced isoform, which
they called SLIMMER (FHL1B), that differs from SLIM1 with a 200-bp
insertion that causes a frameshift. The deduced protein contains 323
amino acids and has a calculated molecular mass of 34 kD. It contains an
N-terminal zinc finger followed by 3 LIM domains identical to SLIM1, and
a novel 93-amino acid C terminus that contains 3 bipartite nuclear
localization signals (NLS) followed by a leucine-rich nuclear export
sequence (NES). Northern blot analysis revealed a 2.4-kb SLIMMER
transcript expressed at high levels in skeletal muscle and at lower
levels in heart, colon, prostate, and small intestine. A 4.4-kb
transcript was also observed in skeletal muscle and colon. Western blot
analysis of skeletal muscle using isoform-specific antibodies revealed
endogenous expression of both a 34-kD SLIMMER protein and a 32-kD SLIM1
protein. Fluorescence-tagged SLIM1 localized to the cytoplasm and
associated with focal adhesions and actin filaments in transfected COS-7
cells, while fluorescence-tagged SLIMMER was predominantly nuclear.
Truncation mutants revealed that the first NLS mediated SLIMMER nuclear
localization.

Brown et al. (1999) found that endogenous Slim1 showed diffuse
cytoplasmic staining and low nuclear staining in mouse myoblasts.
Following differentiation into multinucleated myotubes, Slim1 staining
became exclusively cytoplasmic. SLIMMER showed prominent nuclear
staining of myoblasts and exclusively cytoplasmic staining of myotubes.
The leucine-rich NES was required for the export of Slimmer from the
nucleus of mouse myoblasts to the cytoplasm of differentiated myotubes.
By Northern blot analysis of mouse tissues, Fimia et al. (2000)
determined that Fhl1 was the only Fhl transcript tested that was
expressed in a wide range of tissues. High levels were present in heart,
skeletal muscle, ovary, kidney, lung, and brain, and much lower levels
were found in spleen, liver, adrenal gland, testis, and pituitary.

Ng et al. (2001) identified a third alternatively spliced isoform of the
FHL1 gene, which they designated FHL1C. The deduced 195-residue FHL1C
isoform contains a single zinc finger and 2 tandem repeats of LIM
domains at the N terminus, followed by a putative RBPJ-binding region at
the C terminus. FHL1C lacks exon 4, resulting in a frameshift in the
3-prime coding region and absence of a putative nuclear export sequence
coded by exon 4b. Northern blot and RT-PCR analysis showed that FHL1C
was specifically expressed in testis, skeletal muscle, and heart at a
relatively low level compared with FHL1A. Low levels of FHL1C expression
were observed in aorta, left atrium, and left and right ventricles.
Western blot analysis detected a 20-kD corresponding to FHL1C in human
skeletal muscle and heart. Unlike FHL1B, which is located primarily in
the nucleus, FHL1C was localized both in the nucleus and cytoplasm of
mammalian cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Greene et al. (1999) determined that the FHL1 gene contains at least 5
exons and spans over 3.6 kb. All 4 introns disrupt the coding region at
regular intervals near the start of each complete LIM motif, implying
that exon duplication may be responsible for the tandem LIM domain
repeats.

The FHL1A isoform contains exons 1 through 5, FHL1B contains exons 1, 2,
3, 4, 4b, and 5, and FHL1C contains 1, 2, 3, and 5 (Ng et al., 2001).

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid mapping, FISH, and radiation hybrid mapping, Lee
et al. (1998) mapped the FHL1 gene to chromosome Xq27.2. By FISH, Greene
et al. (1999) mapped the FHL1 gene to Xq26. In connection with myopathy
caused by mutations in the FHL1 gene, Windpassinger et al. (2008)
indirectly mapped the FHL1 gene to Xq26.3.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- X-linked Scapuloperoneal Myopathy

Scapuloperoneal syndrome encompasses heterogeneous neuromuscular
disorders characterized by weakness in the shoulder girdle and peroneal
muscles. In a family originally described by Wilhelmsen et al. (1996)
with a myopathic form of scapuloperoneal syndrome (SPM; 300695), Quinzii
et al. (2008) performed a genomewide scan with microsatellite markers
and mapped the disorder to Xq26. All affected individuals carried a
mutation in the FHL1 gene (W122S; 300163.0001) affecting the second LIM
domain. Schessl et al. (2009) stated that muscle biopsies from patients
from the family reported by Quinzii et al. (2008) had been reexamined
and found to contain reducing bodies, suggesting that the phenotype in
this family may represent a mild form of X-linked reducing body myopathy
(300718).

- X-linked Myopathy with Postural Muscle Atrophy

In affected members of 2 families with an adult-onset
scapuloaxioperoneal myopathy with bent spine syndrome characterized by
specific atrophy of postural muscles and cardiac involvement (XMPMA;
300696), Windpassinger et al. (2008) identified 2 different mutations in
the FHL1 gene (300163.0002; 300163.0003). There was muscle hypertrophy
in the early stages of the disorder.

Schoser et al. (2009) identified mutations in the C terminus of the FHL1
gene in 7 additional families with XMPMA (see, e.g., 300163.0002;
300163.0013; 300163.0014). Muscle biopsies showed absence of the FHL1 A
isoform. No reducing bodies were identified.

- Emery-Dreifuss Muscular Dystrophy 6

In affected members of 6 unrelated families with Emery-Dreifuss muscular
dystrophy-6 (EDMD6; see 300696), Gueneau et al. (2009) identified 6
different mutations in the FHL1 gene (see, e.g.,
300163.0010-300163.0012). A patient with sporadic disease also had an
FHL1 mutation. The mutations were preferentially located in the most
distal exons 5 to 8 of FHL1 and impaired the 3 isoforms to various
degrees.

- X-Linked Reducing Body Myopathy

In 2 unrelated girls with severe, early-onset reducing body myopathy
(300717), Schessl et al. (2008) identified a de novo heterozygous
mutation in the FHL1 gene (300163.0004 and 300163.0005, respectively).
Two unrelated boys with childhood-onset reducing body myopathy (300718)
had hemizygous mutation in the FHL1 gene (300163.0006 and 300163.0007,
respectively). Schessl et al. (2008) used a proteomic technique to
identify FHL1 as the main protein component of the reducing bodies in
these patients.

Schessl et al. (2009) reported 5 unrelated patients with sporadic
early-onset severe X-linked reducing myopathy (300717) and reviewed
their previously reported patients (Schessl et al., 2008). All 5
patients had de novo mutations in the same residue of the second LIM
domain of the FHL1 gene, affecting all 3 isoforms (H123Y; 300163.0004,
H123L; 300163.0015, and H123Q; 300163.0016). Onset was in early
childhood, and the disorder was rapidly progressive, leading to proximal
muscle weakness and atrophy, loss of ambulation, contractures, and often
respiratory insufficiency. There were 4 girls and 1 boy: the boy was
more severely affected. Other features included scoliosis and spinal
rigidity. Muscle biopsies showed FHL1-positive aggregates and reducing
bodies. Schessl et al. (2009) concluded that mutations in the second LIM
domain of FHL1 result in reducing body myopathy.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
SCAPULOPERONEAL MYOPATHY, X-LINKED DOMINANT
FHL1, TRP122SER

In an Italian-American family with scapuloperoneal myopathy (300695),
Quinzii et al. (2008) demonstrated that the disorder was X-linked
dominant and caused by a missense mutation in the FHL1 gene:a 365G-C
transversion in exon 3 that caused a trp122 to ser substitution (W122S)
in the second LIM domain of the protein.

Schessl et al. (2009) stated that muscle biopsies from patients from the
family reported by Quinzii et al. (2008) had been reexamined and found
to contain reducing bodies, suggesting that the phenotype in this family
may represent a mild form of X-linked reducing body myopathy (300718).

.0002
MYOPATHY, X-LINKED, WITH POSTURAL MUSCLE ATROPHY
FHL1, CYS224TRP

In an extensive Austrian family in which males in 5 generations had a
novel form of myopathy they referred to as X-linked myopathy with
postural muscle atrophy and generalized hypertrophy (XMPMA; 300696),
Windpassinger et al. (2008) detected a 672C-G transversion in the FHL1
gene that resulted in a cys224-to-trp (C224W) substitution in the fourth
LIM domain of isoform A and in the nuclear localization signal of
isoform B. Patients had muscle hypertrophy in the early stages, followed
by postural muscle weakness and atrophy, increased serum creatine
kinase, bent spine, and cardiomyopathy. The C224W mutation was predicted
to disrupt the zinc-binding properties of FHL1A and to impair shuttling
between nucleus and cytoplasm of FHL1B. Impairment of zinc binding may
have reduced protein stability and structure. Isoform C was not
affected, which the authors hypothesized may have resulted in the
relatively mild phenotype; no females were affected.

Schoser et al. (2009) reported 3 additional unrelated German families
with XMPMA associated with the C224W mutation in the FHL1 gene. A fourth
patient, later found to be distantly related to the Austrian family
reported by Windpassinger et al. (2008), was also identified. The
phenotype was similar to that reported by Windpassinger et al. (2008).
The mutation is predicted to disrupt the fourth LIM domain.

.0003
MYOPATHY, X-LINKED, WITH POSTURAL MUSCLE ATROPHY
SCAPULOPERONEAL MYOPATHY, X-LINKED DOMINANT, INCLUDED
FHL1, 3-BP INS, 381ATC

In a family of British origin with X-linked myopathy with postural
muscle atrophy and generalized hypertrophy (XMPMA; 300696),
Windpassinger et al. (2008) identified a 3-bp insertion after nucleotide
381 of the FHL1 gene (381_382insATC), leading to the insertion of an
isoleucine residue within the second LIM domain (phe127_thr128insile).
The mutation affected all 3 FHL1 isoforms.

Sarkozy et al. (2011) reported 2 additional British families with the
381delATC mutation. These 2 families and the family reported by
Windpassinger et al. (2008) shared the same haplotype, consistent with a
founder effect. The family reported by Windpassinger et al. (2008)
included 4 males who presented in their thirties with progressive
proximal muscle weakness causing walking difficulties and shoulder
weakness. The disorder was progressive with at least 2 patients becoming
wheelchair-bound. Other features included spinal rigidity, scapular
winging, increased serum creatine kinase, and decreased vital
respiratory capacity. One family reported by Sarkozy et al. (2011)
included 11 affected individuals (5 women) spanning 5 generations. Three
men had onset of symptoms in the second to third decade, with
predominant progressive limb girdle weakness, predominantly affecting
the upper limbs, and scapular winging. They also had spinal rigidity and
reduced lung function. An additional 3 deceased male family members were
reported as being wheelchair-bound from their thirties, and dying in
their late forties/early fifties of cardiorespiratory failure. Female
mutation carriers had a slightly later onset of milder symptoms. In the
other family reported by Sarkozy et al. (2011), 5 males spanning 4
generations were affected. One had onset in young adulthood of
progressive proximal upper and lower limb weakness, foot drop, and
restricted neck movements with increased serum creatine kinase. Other
family members reportedly had gait difficulties. Sarkozy et al. (2011)
noted the heterogeneous phenotypes in these 3 families, although they
all had an overall late presentation most consistent with XMPMA.
However, the involvement of women in the second family was reminiscent
of X-linked dominant scapuloperoneal myopathy (300695).

.0004
MYOPATHY, REDUCING BODY, X-LINKED, SEVERE EARLY-ONSET
FHL1, HIS123TYR

In a girl with severe, early-onset X-linked myopathy with reducing
bodies (300717), Schessl et al. (2008) identified a de novo heterozygous
367C-T transition in the third coding exon of the FHL1 gene, resulting
in a his123-to-tyr (H123Y) substitution in the second LIM domain
involved in coordinating zinc binding. The H123Y mutation was predicted
to result in complete disruption of the zinc-binding sites and collapse
of the LIM domain. In vitro functional expression studies showed that
the mutant protein initiated aggregation of the FHL1 protein, formed
reducing bodies and trapped wildtype FHL1 into the inclusion bodies,
consistent with a dominant-negative effect. The child lost ambulation by
at age 3 years and had respiratory insufficiency. Schessl et al. (2009)
reported follow-up on the patient reported by Schessl et al. (2008). She
had mildly delayed motor development, learning to walk at 18 months, but
was never able to run or stand up from a sitting position. The disease
progressed at age 2 years, with poor head control and neck weakness,
leading wheelchair dependency at age 3. She had proximal muscle
weakness, progressive spinal rigidity, and scoliosis. At age 8 years,
she is ventilated continuously, has a gastrostomy tube, and has lost all
antigravity strength except for her finger extensors. There is no
apparent cardiac involvement.

Schessl et al. (2009) reported another unrelated girl with a
heterozygous H123Y mutation. She had onset before age 1.5 years of
proximal muscle weakness and Gowers sign. Mutations affecting the same
FHL1 codon have also been reported in this phenotype (H123L,
300163.0015; H123Q, 300163.0016).

.0005
MYOPATHY, REDUCING BODY, X-LINKED, SEVERE EARLY-ONSET
FHL1, CYS132PHE

In a girl with severe, early-onset X-linked myopathy with reducing
bodies (300717), Schessl et al. (2008) identified a de novo heterozygous
395G-T transversion in exon 3 of the FHL1 gene, resulting in a
cys132-to-phe (C132F) substitution in the second LIM domain involved in
coordinating zinc binding. The C132F mutation was predicted to result in
complete disruption of the zinc-binding sites and collapse of the LIM
domain. In vitro functional expression studies showed that the mutant
protein initiated aggregation of the FHL1 protein, formed reducing
bodies and trapped wildtype FHL1 into the inclusion bodies, consistent
with a dominant-negative effect. The child lost ambulation by age 4.5
years and died of respiratory failure at age 6.5 years.

.0006
MYOPATHY, REDUCING BODY, X-LINKED, CHILDHOOD-ONSET
FHL1, CYS153ARG

In a boy with X-linked reducing body myopathy with childhood onset
(300718), Schessl et al. (2008) identified a 457T-C transition in the
FHL1 gene, resulting in a cys153-to-arg (C153R) substitution in the
second zinc finger of the LIM2 domain. The patient's mother, who was
heterozygous for the mutation, was less severely affected. The boy had
onset of weakness at age 5 years, became ventilator-dependent by age 11
years, and developed cardiomyopathy at 18 years. A mutation in the same
codon (C153Y; 300163.0007) was identified in an unrelated family with
the same disorder.

.0007
MYOPATHY, REDUCING BODY, X-LINKED, CHILDHOOD-ONSET
FHL1, CYS153TYR

In a boy with X-linked reducing myopathy with childhood onset (300718),
Schessl et al. (2008) identified a 458G-A transition in the FHL1 gene,
resulting in a cys153-to-tyr (C153Y) substitution in the second zinc
finger of the LIM2 domain. The patient's mother, who was heterozygous
for the mutation, was less severely affected. The boy had onset of
weakness and rigid spine symptoms at age 10 years, leading to loss of
ambulation at age 16. A mutation in the same codon (C153R; 300163.0006)
was identified in an unrelated family with the same disorder.

.0008
MYOPATHY, REDUCING BODY, X-LINKED, SEVERE EARLY-ONSET
FHL1, CYS150TYR

In a patient with fatal early-onset reducing body myopathy (300717),
Shalaby et al. (2009) identified a heterozygous 449G-A transition in the
FHL1 gene, resulting in a cys150-to-tyr (C150Y) substitution in the
second LIM domain. The patient had previously been reported by Kiyomoto
et al. (1995).

.0009
MYOPATHY, REDUCING BODY, X-LINKED, CHILDHOOD-ONSET
FHL1, CYS104ARG

In a mother and son with adult- and childhood-onset reducing body
myopathy (300718), respectively, Shalaby et al. (2009) identified a
310T-C transition in the FHL1 gene, resulting in a cys104-to-arg (C104R)
substitution in the second LIM domain. The family had previously been
reported by Ohsawa et al. (2007).

.0010
EMERY-DREIFUSS MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY 6
FHL1, TER281GLU

In 3 brothers from Saudi Arabia with Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy-6
(EDMD6; see 300696), Gueneau et al. (2009) identified an 841T-G
transversion in exon 8 of the FHL1 gene, resulting in a ter281-to-glu
(X281E) substitution in the last codon. This change suppressed the
termination codon and predicted a larger protein with 52 additional
amino acids at the C terminus of the FHL1A isoform. The proband
presented at age 10 years with stiff neck, and later developed
scapular-peroneal weakness and atrophy, multiple joint contractures, and
scoliosis. He also had dysphonia due to vocal cord palsy. At age 18
years, he was found to have cardiac involvement characterized by septal
hypertrophy. Skeletal muscle biopsy showed dystrophic changes with no
reducing bodies and markedly decreased FHL1A protein expression. In
vitro studies of patient myoblasts showed a delay in myogenin (MYOG;
159980) activation and myoblast fusion, without major impacts on
sarcomere formation.

.0011
EMERY-DREIFUSS MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY 6
FHL1, CYS209ARG

In affected members of a large family with Emery-Dreifuss muscular
dystrophy-6 (EDMD6; see 300696), Gueneau et al. (2009) identified a
625C-T transition in exon 6 of the FHL1 gene, resulting in a
cys209-to-arg (C209R) substitution affecting a highly conserved cys
residue of the LIM3 domain of the FHL1A and FHL1B isoforms. The proband
presented at age 11 years with stiff neck. He later developed scapular
and pelvic muscle weakness and atrophy, multiple joint contractures,
scoliosis, and increased serum creatine kinase. At age 39, he had
cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac hypertrophy; He died suddenly at age 51.
Most affected family members had both cardiac disease and myopathy,
although some had only isolated cardiac disease or myopathy. There were
several affected females who were heterozygous for the mutation.
Skeletal muscle biopsy of the proband showed a dystrophic pattern and
moderately decreased FHL1 protein expression.

Knoblauch et al. (2010) identified the C209R mutation in 9 affected male
members of a large 4-generation German family with EDMD6. Age at onset
was in the first or second decade, and all had contractures and rigid
spine. Five had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, 2 had left ventricular
hypertrophy with fibrosis and hypertension, 1 had apical myocardial
thinning, and 1 had normal cardiac findings. Only 1 had conduction
abnormalities, and only 1 had clear muscle weakness; most appeared
muscular but not athletic. Two female carriers of the mutation had rigid
spine symptoms, and 1 had left ventricular hypertrophy with
hypertension. None of the patients was or became wheelchair-bound.
Skeletal muscle biopsy from 3 patients showed cytoplasmic bodies, but
not reducing bodies, and dystrophic features. Western blot analysis
showed decreased expression of FHL1.

.0012
EMERY-DREIFUSS MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY 6
FHL1, 1-BP INS, NT817

In a man with Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy-6 (EDMD6; see 300696),
Gueneau et al. (2009) identified a 1-bp insertion (817dup) in exon 8 of
the FHL1 gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature termination
affecting only the FHL1A isoform that lacks the last 2 cysteines of the
LIM4 domain. He presented at age 6 years with elbow and Achilles tendon
contractures, and later developed scapular and pelvic muscle weakness
and atrophy. Other features included muscle hypertrophy, dysphonia due
to vocal cord palsy, and increased serum creatine kinase. By age 30, he
had cardiac septal hypertrophy and respiratory insufficiency; he died
suddenly at age 31. Skeletal muscle biopsy showed myopathic changes and
no reducing bodies. The patient's mother, who was heterozygous for the
mutation, had isolated hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

.0013
MYOPATHY, X-LINKED, WITH POSTURAL MUSCLE ATROPHY
FHL1, VAL280MET

In 2 affected males from a German family with X-linked myopathy with
postural muscle atrophy (XMPMA; 300696), Schoser et al. (2009)
identified an 838G-A transition in exon 5 of the FHL1 gene, resulting in
a val280-to-met (V280M) substitution in isoform B. The mutation was not
found in 247 control chromosomes. Both boys had onset at age 8 years of
exercise-induced fatigue and Achilles tendon shortening, and later
developed proximal lower leg weakness. No overt cardiac involvement was
noted. A female carrier in the family was unaffected.

.0014
MYOPATHY, X-LINKED, WITH POSTURAL MUSCLE ATROPHY
FHL1, IVS4DS, G-A, +1

In 2 affected males from a German family with XMPMA (300696), Schoser et
al. (2009) identified a G-to-A transition in the donor splice site of
intron 4 of the FHL1 gene, resulting in the skipping of exon 4. The
splice site is located after the second LIM domain, and caused premature
termination of the protein, generation of isoform C only, and loss of
both isoforms A and B. The proband had progressive Achilles tendon
shortening since childhood, and developed a progressive aneurysm of the
sinus of Valsalva since age 18. He had exercise-induced weakness and
proximal muscle weakness. The other male patient presented with mild
rigid spine syndrome, kyphoscoliosis, and Achilles tendon contractures
since age 10 years. He was also noted to have a progressive aneurysm of
the sinus of Valsalva since age 12. One female mutation carrier was
noted with exercise-induced weakness and myalgia since age 40 years.

.0015
MYOPATHY, REDUCING BODY, X-LINKED, SEVERE EARLY-ONSET
FHL1, HIS123LEU

In a 7-year-old girl with severe early-onset reducing body myopathy
(300717), Schessl et al. (2009) identified a heterozygous de novo 368A-T
transversion in exon 4 of the FHL1 gene, resulting in a his123-to-leu
(H123L) substitution in the second LIM domain. She had onset at age 4
years of frequent falls, difficulty walking, progressive proximal muscle
weakness of the upper and lower limbs, and scoliosis. Mutations
affecting the same FHL1 codon have also been reported in this phenotype
(H123Y, 300163.0004; H123Q, 300163.0016).

.0016
MYOPATHY, REDUCING BODY, X-LINKED, SEVERE EARLY-ONSET
FHL1, HIS123GLN

In 3 unrelated patients, 2 girls and 1 boy, with severe early-onset
reducing body myopathy (300717), Schessl et al. (2009) identified a de
novo 369C-G transversion in exon 4 of the FHL1 gene, resulting in a
his123-to-gln (H123Q) substitution in the second LIM domain. Onset
ranged from 12 months to 4 years. Patients had frequent falls,
progressive loss of ambulation by age 10 years, proximal muscle weakness
in the upper and lower limbs, and contractures. Two patients had
respiratory insufficiency. One had mild mitral insufficiency, and
another had cardiac arrest at age 3 years. The boy had earlier onset and
a more severe phenotype. The girls were heterozygous for the mutation.
Mutations affecting the same FHL1 codon have also been reported in this
phenotype (H123Y, 300163.0004; H123L, 300163.0015).

.0017
MYOPATHY, REDUCING BODY, X-LINKED, CHILDHOOD-ONSET
FHL1, 9-BP DEL, NT451

In a 16-year-old boy with late childhood onset of X-linked reducing body
myopathy (300718), Shalaby et al. (2008) identified a hemizygous
in-frame 9-bp deletion (451delGTGACTTGC) in the FHL1 gene, resulting in
the deletion of val151, thr152, and cys153, which affected a cysteine
residue in the second LIM domain. The patient was a good runner during
childhood and was noted to have scoliosis at age 13 years. He then
developed progressive walking and running difficulties. By age 16, he
had difficulty in bending his body and in neck flexion, atrophy and
weakness of the proximal muscles, and joint contractures. He was
diagnosed with rigid spine syndrome. Skeletal muscle biopsy showed
intracytoplasmic inclusions, rimmed vacuoles, and decreased FHL1 protein
levels.

614780	TITLE *614780 SORTING NEXIN 10; SNX10
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SNX10 belongs to a large family of sorting nexins that regulate
vesicle-mediated protein trafficking (Chen et al., 2012).

CLONING

By searching human databases for sequences similar to yeast SNX1
(601272), Teasdale et al. (2001) identified SNX10. The deduced protein
has a central 122-amino acid SNX-type Phox (see NCF1, 608512) homology
(PX) domain characterized by conserved arg-arg-tyr-X-asp/glu and
pro-pro-X-pro-X-lys motifs.

Qin et al. (2006) reported that full-length SNX10 is 201 amino acids
long and has an N-terminal PX domain. Upon overexpression, SNX10
localized to early endosomes.

Chen et al. (2012) found that a fraction of epitope-tagged SNX10
localized to centrioles and to the base of cilia in RCC10/VHL human
renal carcinoma cells.

MAPPING

Hartz (2012) mapped the SNX10 gene to chromosome 7p15.2 based on an
alignment of the SNX10 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF121860) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

GENE FUNCTION

Qin et al. (2006) found that overexpression of SNX10, but not any other
SNX examined, induced the formation of giant vacuoles in all transfected
cell lines examined. Electron microscopy, immunohistochemical analysis,
and brefeldin A treatment showed that the vesicles originated from early
endosomes and that SNX10-induced vacuolization was a Golgi-dependent
process. Mutation analysis revealed that SNX10 bound to
phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate via arg53 in the PX domain, but both
the PX and C-terminal domains were required for vacuole formation.

Using loss-of-function assays in human cell lines and in zebrafish, Chen
et al. (2012) showed that SNX10 was required for ciliogenesis in vitro
and in vivo. SNX10 bound to the V1D subunit of the vacuolar H+ ATPase
(ATP6V1D; 609398) and was essential for the trafficking of RAB8A
(165040)-positive vesicles to ciliary membranes. The PX domain of SNX10
was required for the interaction with ATP6V1D. Both SNX10 and ATP6V1D
localized to the base of cilia and were required for ciliary trafficking
of RAB8A and formation of cilia.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected children from 3 unrelated consanguineous Palestinian
families segregating autosomal recessive osteopetrosis mapping to
chromosome 7p15 (OPTB8; 615085), Aker et al. (2012) sequenced 5
candidate genes and identified homozygosity for a missense mutation in
the SNX10 gene (R51Q; 614780.0001) that segregated with disease in each
family. Screening of 211 ethnically matched controls revealed 1
heterozygous carrier of the R51Q mutation. In the patients' osteoclasts,
which were fewer and smaller than control cells, mutant SNX10 was
abnormally abundant and its distribution altered; in addition,
resorptive capacity of patient osteoclasts was markedly deranged, and
the endosomal pathway was perturbed as evidenced by the distribution of
internalized dextran.

ANIMAL MODEL

Chen et al. (2012) found that zebrafish Snx10a, but not Snx10b,
represented the physiologic ortholog of human SNX10. Morpholino-mediated
knockdown of Snx10a resulted in larva that appeared mostly normal, but
heart looping was randomized and morphants developed pronephric cysts.
Cilia number, but not length, was reduced in Kupffer vesicles. Knockdown
of V-ATPase V1d in zebrafish resulted in a similar phenotype.
Cotreatment of embryos with anti-Snx10 and anti-V1d morpholinos at
dosages that did not disrupt heart looping individually, effectively
induced a heart-looping defect. Chen et al. (2012) concluded that both
Snx10 and V1d are required for cilia formation and left-right patterning
in zebrafish.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
OSTEOPETROSIS, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE 8
SNX10, ARG51GLN

In affected children from 3 unrelated consanguineous Palestinian
families with autosomal recessive osteopetrosis mapping to chromosome
7p15 (OPTB8; 615085), Aker et al. (2012) identified homozygosity for a
152G-A transition in exon 3 of the SNX10 gene, resulting in an
arg51-to-gln (R51Q) substitution at a highly conserved residue. The
mutation, which segregated with disease in each family, was found in
heterozygosity in 1 of 211 ethnically matched controls. Patient
osteoclasts displayed extensive cytoplasmic vacuolation, which was
nearly absent from age-matched control cells. Examination of fluorescent
dextran-loaded cells revealed that 25% of patient cells contained large
endosomal vacuoles, compared to only 2% of control cells. Immunostaining
demonstrated a notable increase in mutant protein in patient cells, with
a distribution pattern strikingly different from that of controls,
including prominent SNX10-positive punctae that were clustered
throughout the cytoplasm. Functional analysis showed that the patients'
cells resorbed far less substrate compared to control cells.

600365	TITLE *600365 ACTIVE BCR-RELATED GENE; ABR
DESCRIPTION Heisterkamp et al. (1989) described an active BCR-related gene (ABR)
that they identified based on its homology with the BCR gene (151410)
located on chromosome 22. BCR is involved in reciprocal translocations
with the ABL oncogene (189980) on chromosome 9 in Philadelphia
chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia. Heisterkamp et al.
(1993) mapped the ABR gene to 17p13.3 by in situ hybridization
techniques. McDonald et al. (1994) found that the ABR locus was deleted
in 7 of 8 informative cases of medulloblastoma. Using pulsed field gel
electrophoresis, they localized a polymorphic marker of the ABR gene to
within 220 kb of D17S34. A cosmid contig constructed in this region was
used to demonstrate by fluorescence in situ hybridization that the
5-prime to 3-prime transcriptional orientation of the ABR gene is toward
the telomere.

614906	TITLE *614906 SORTING NEXIN 11; SNX11
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SNX11 belongs to a large family of proteins characterized by the
presence of an SNX-type phox (see 608512) homology (PX) domain with
conserved arg-arg-tyr-X-asp/glu and pro-pro-X-pro-X-lys motifs. SNX
family members are predicted to be involved in the sorting of endosomes
(Teasdale et al., 2001).

CLONING

By searching databases for sequences similar to yeast Snx1 (601272),
Teasdale et al. (2001) identified human SNX11. The deduced protein has a
central 121-amino acid SNX-PH domain, but it lacks C-terminal
coiled-coil motifs found in several other SNX family members.

MAPPING

Hartz (2012) mapped the SNX11 gene to chromosome 17q21.32 based on an
alignment of the SNX11 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF121861) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

611463	TITLE *611463 SPERMIDINE/SPERMINE N(1)-ACETYLTRANSFERASE 2; SAT2
;;SSAT2;;
THIALYSINE N-EPSILON-ACETYLTRANSFERASE
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

In the polyamine back-conversion pathway, spermidine/spermine
N(1)-acetyltransferase-1 (SAT1; 313020) acetylates spermine and
spermidine, which are then oxidized by polyamine oxidase to produce
spermidine and putrescine, respectively. By database analysis to search
for genes similar to SAT1, Chen et al. (2003) identified SAT2, which
they called SSAT2. The deduced 170-amino acid protein has a calculated
molecular mass of 19 kD and has 46% amino acid identity to SAT1. Both
SAT1 and SAT2 contain a general N(1)-acetyltransferase (GNAT) domain
spanning 87 amino acids. SAT2 homologs were found in a variety of
species from bacteria to eukaryotes in all major lineages. All species
below vertebrates had 1 copy of SSAT, whereas all vertebrate species,
with the exception of chicken and Xenopus, had functional SAT1 and SAT2
genes. Northern blot and EST analysis indicated that SAT1 was expressed
at higher levels than SAT2 and in a wider range of tissues, although
bone, cervix, ovary, and pineal gland expressed only SAT2.

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to SSAT1, followed by
PCR of fetal liver and HeLa cell cDNA libraries, Coleman et al. (2004)
cloned SSAT2. They also identified a SSAT2 splice variant lacking exon
4. Both S. pombe and human SSAT2 lack C-terminal residues that in SSAT1
are important for polyamine acetyltransferase activity and for SSAT1
proteolytic degradation. PCR analysis revealed ubiquitous expression of
2 SSAT2 variants in human tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

Chen et al. (2003) found that SAT1 showed a much greater preference for
spermidine than spermine, whereas SAT2 showed similar preference for the
2 polyamines. Both SAT1- and SAT2-transfected cell extracts had much
higher acetylating activity than vector-transfected cell extracts;
however, SAT2 had no effect on polyamine pools in intact transfected
cells. They concluded that SAT2 is probably contained within an
organelle that prevents interaction with intracellular polyamines and/or
with the enzyme cofactor acetyl-CoA. Unlike SAT1, SAT2 was not inducible
by spermine analogs at the level of mRNA or enzyme activity.

Coleman et al. (2004) found that polyamines were poor acetyl acceptors
in reactions catalyzed by purified recombinant S. pombe or human SSAT2.
Thialysine, a naturally occurring modified amino acid, was a much better
substrate for SSAT2, but not for SSAT1, and was acetylated by SSAT2 at
the epsilon-amino group. Human SSAT2 also acetylated L-lysine, but much
less efficiently. In contrast to SSAT1, SSAT2 was not toxic when
overexpressed in mouse fibroblasts, it had little effect on the
polyamine content of transfected cells, and its expression was
unaffected by treatment with a polyamine analog. In addition, unlike
SSAT1, SSAT2 was relatively stable in in vitro stability assays and in
transfected cells. Coleman et al. (2004) concluded that SSAT2 is not
involved in polyamine metabolism and suggested that it should be renamed
'thialysine N-epsilon-acetyltransferase.'

The HIF1 complex is a heterodimeric transcription factor that functions
in oxygen homeostasis. The HIF1A subunit (603348) is subject to
oxygen-dependent prolyl hydroxylation leading to ubiquitination by the
VHL (608537)-elongin C (TCEB1; 600788) ubiquitin-ligase complex,
followed by degradation of HIF1A by the 26S proteasome (see 602706).
Using gain- and loss-of-function experiments, Baek et al. (2007) found
that SSAT2 played an essential role in this process. SSAT2 bound HIF1A,
VHL, and elongin C and promoted ubiquitination of hydroxylated HIF1A by
stabilizing the interaction of VHL and elongin C. Regulation of HIF1A by
SSAT2 depended upon prolyl hydroxylation of HIF1A by PHD2 (EGLN1;
606425). Mutation of the conserved SSAT2 residues ser82 and thr83, which
are required for acetyltransferase activity, reduced, but did not
eliminate, the ability of SSAT2 to promote HIF1A degradation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Chen et al. (2003) determined that the SAT2 gene contains 6 exons.

MAPPING

Chen et al. (2003) stated that the SAT2 gene maps to chromosome 17p13.1.

603948	TITLE *603948 NUCLEOPORIN, 153-KD; NUP153
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Nuclear pore complexes are elaborate structures that mediate the
regulated movement of macromolecules between the nucleus and cytoplasm.
These complexes are composed of at least 100 different polypeptide
subunits, many of which belong to the nucleoporin family. Nucleoporins
are pore complex-specific glycoproteins characterized by cytoplasmically
oriented O-linked N-acetylglucosamine residues and numerous repeats of
the pentapeptide sequence XFXFG.

CLONING

By immunoscreening a HeLa cell cDNA expression library with a monoclonal
antibody that recognizes a group of nucleoporins, McMorrow et al. (1994)
isolated a cDNA encoding NUP153. The deduced 1,475-amino acid protein
has a calculated molecular mass of 153.8 kD. It contains 33 copies of
the XFXFG sequence, a C-terminal half that is serine- and
threonine-rich, and 4 sequence motifs that resemble those of zinc
fingers. The human and rat NUP153 proteins are 82% identical. Northern
blot analysis detected a 6-kb human NUP153 mRNA.

GENE FUNCTION

Ullman et al. (1999) found that antibodies to Xenopus Nup153 blocked
export of snRNA, mRNA, and 5S rRNA from the nucleus, but did not impede
export of tRNA or recycling of importin-beta (see KPNB1; 602738) to the
cytoplasm. They also determined that Nup153, unlike other nucleoporins,
associates strongly with poly(G) and poly(U). The interaction may be
direct or may be via an adaptor protein.

By immunogold electron microscopy, Walther et al. (2001) localized
Xenopus Nup153 to the nuclear ring of the nuclear pore complex (NPC).
NPCs assembled in the absence of Nup153 lacked several nuclear basket
components, were unevenly distributed in the nuclear envelope, and,
unlike wildtype NPCs, were mobile within the nuclear envelope. Nuclear
import events requiring importin-alpha (see KPNA5; 604545)/importin-beta
were also defective due to reduced translocation of the import complex
rather than defective receptor recycling.

Liu et al. (2003) found that a central region of Xenopus Nup153
associated with COPI (601924), a coatomer complex previously
characterized in the context of vesicle budding during trafficking
within the Golgi and between the Golgi and the endoplasmic reticulum.
Nup153 recruited COPI to the nuclear membrane during mitosis, suggesting
that vesiculation is an important step in nuclear envelope breakdown.
Perturbing the function of the COPI complex impaired nuclear envelope
disassembly.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the NUP153
gene to chromosome 6 (TMAP WI-7306).

606343	TITLE *606343 POLYMERASE, DNA, LAMBDA; POLL
DESCRIPTION DNA polymerases can participate in both replication of the genome and
DNA repair processes. The human genome contains multiple DNA polymerase
genes.

CLONING

By searching sequence databases to identify new members of the polX
family, Aoufouchi et al. (2000) identified EST clones representing 2 DNA
polymerases, POLM (606344) and POLL, which they called pol mu and pol
lambda, respectively. By screening bone marrow and lymph node cDNA
libraries, they isolated a full-length POLL cDNA. POLL encodes a deduced
575-amino acid protein predicted to contain a polX domain, a BRCA-1
C-terminal (BRCT) domain, and 2 helix-hairpin-helix (HHH) DNA-binding
motifs. POLL structurally resembles terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase
(TDT; 187410). It shares 34% amino acid identity with DNA polymerase
beta (POLB; 174760) and 82% identity with mouse Poll. Aoufouchi et al.
(2000) found that POLL has template-dependent DNA polymerase activity in
vitro. Northern blot analysis detected a 2.7-kb POLL transcript with
highest expression in testis and fetal liver and very weak expression in
many other tissues. They identified POLL splice variants which they
considered to be nonfunctional. Using semiquantitative RT-PCR
amplification, Aoufouchi et al. (2000) concluded that POLL mRNA
expression is downregulated in a dose- and time-dependent manner upon
cell exposure to DNA damaging agents.

Aoufouchi et al. (2000) provided a phylogenetic comparison of yeast and
human proteins of the polX family.

GENE STRUCTURE

Aoufouchi et al. (2000) determined that POLL is encoded by 8 exons and
spans approximately 9 kb of genomic DNA.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the POLL
gene to human chromosome 10 (TMAP sts-W69567).

604884	TITLE *604884 NEVER IN MITOSIS GENE A-RELATED KINASE 6; NEK6
;;NIMA-RELATED KINASE 6
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The Aspergillus nidulans 'never in mitosis A' (NIMA) gene encodes a
serine/threonine kinase that controls initiation of mitosis.
NIMA-related kinases (NEKs) are a group of protein kinases that are
homologous to NIMA. Evidence suggests that NEKs perform functions
similar to those of NIMA.

CLONING

Li et al. (1999) reported the cloning of a human liver cDNA encoding
NEK6. Kimura and Okano (2001) determined that NEK6 and NEK7 (606848)
share 77% amino acid identity. By Northern blot analysis, Li et al.
(1999) detected 1.6-, 2.6-, and 9.5-kb NEK6 transcripts. The 1.6-kb
transcript was expressed at highest levels in liver and placenta. By
RT-PCR, Kimura and Okano (2001) found expression of NEK6 in all tissues
examined.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid mapping, Li et al. (1999) mapped the NEK6 gene to
9q33.3-q34.11.
