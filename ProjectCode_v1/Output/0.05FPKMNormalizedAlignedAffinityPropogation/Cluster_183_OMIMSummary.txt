614218	TITLE *614218 WD REPEAT-CONTAINING PROTEIN 81; WDR81
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Okazaki et al. (2004) cloned mouse Wdr81, which they designated
FLJ00182. The deduced protein contains 693 amino acids.

Gulsuner et al. (2011) stated that the longest isoform of the human
WDR81 gene, isoform 1, contains 1,941 amino acids. The protein contains
an N-terminal BEACH (Beige and Chediak-Higashi) domain, a MFS (major
facilitator superfamily) domain, and 6 C-terminal WD40 repeats. The
protein is predicted to be a transmembrane protein with 6
membrane-spanning domains. Human WDR81 was expressed in all brain
regions analyzed, with highest levels of expression in the cerebellum
and corpus callosum. Wdr81 was detected in Purkinje cells in the
cerebellum of mouse embryos, and was coexpressed with genes involved in
neuronal differentiation and projection, axonogenesis, and cell
morphogenesis, suggesting a role in development.

GENE STRUCTURE

Gulsuner et al. (2011) stated that the human WDR81 gene contains 10
exons.

MAPPING

Hartz (2011) mapped the WDR81 gene to chromosome 17p13.3 based on an
alignment of the WDR81 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK091136) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

Okazaki et al. (2004) mapped the mouse Wdr81 gene to chromosome 11.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of a consanguineous Turkish family with autosomal
recessive cerebellar ataxia, mental retardation, and dysequilibrium
syndrome-2 (CAMRQ2; 610185), Gulsuner et al. (2011) identified a
homozygous mutation in the WDR81 gene (P856L; 614218.0001). Homozygosity
for the mutation segregated with the phenotype. The mutation occurred in
a highly conserved residue and was not found in 549 controls. The
mutation was found by targeted sequencing of the candidate disease
region identified by linkage analysis. The family had originally been
reported by Turkmen et al. (2006) as having cerebellar hypoplasia,
mental retardation, and an inability to walk bipedally, resulting in
quadrupedal locomotion as a functional adaptation. Brain MRI of affected
individuals by Gulsuner et al. (2011) showed morphologic abnormalities
in the cerebellum and corpus callosum, in particular atrophy of
superior, middle, and inferior peduncles of the cerebellum. Structural
MRI showed additional morphometric abnormalities in several cortical
areas, including the corpus callosum, precentral gyrus, and several
Brodmann areas.

WDR81, PRO856LEU

In affected members of a consanguineous Turkish family with autosomal
recessive cerebellar ataxia, mental retardation, and dysequilibrium
syndrome-2 (CAMRQ2; 610185) (Turkmen et al., 2006), Gulsuner et al.
(2011) identified a homozygous C-to-T transition at cDNA position 2567
(2567C-T) in exon 1 of the WDR81 gene, resulting in a pro856-to-leu
(P856L) substitution in a highly conserved residue in the MFS domain of
isoform 1. The mutation was not found in 549 controls.

611887	TITLE *611887 UROPLAKIN 3B; UPK3B
;;UPIIIB;;
P35
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

UPK3B is a minor component of the apical plaques of mammalian urothelium
that binds and dimerizes with uroplakin-1b (UPK1B; 602380), one of the
major conserved urothelium membrane proteins. The other major conserved
integral membrane proteins of urothelial plaques are UPK1A (611557),
UPK2 (611558), and UPK3A (611559) (Deng et al., 2002).

CLONING

By screening a human bladder cDNA library using bovine Upk3b, Deng et
al. (2002) cloned UPK3B, which they called p35. They also cloned mouse
and bovine Upk3b, which both share over 90% amino acid identity with
UPK3B. Bovine Upk3b contains a signal peptide, a transmembrane domain,
an N-terminal extracellular domain containing several N-glycosylation
sites, and a short C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. The N-terminal
extracellular domain contains an 80-amino acid sequence with homology to
PMS2L11. Northern blot, Western blot, and immunohistochemical studies
detected urothelium-specific expression of Upk3b mRNA and protein in
bovine and mouse tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

Using cotransfection, followed by immunoprecipitation, Deng et al.
(2002) demonstrated that UPK3B bound UPK1B but did not bind UPK1A, UPK2,
and UPK3A. UPK3B was glycosylated, and cotransfection studies showed
that the UPK3B/UPK1B complex was endoglycosidase H-resistant and able to
exit the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), suggesting that the UPK3B/UPK1B
complex forms in the ER and is exported to the cell surface.
Upk3a-deficient mice showed a 6-fold increase in both Upk3b and Upk1b
mRNAs, suggesting a coordinated regulation of Upk3b and Upk1b
expression.

GENE STRUCTURE

Deng et al. (2002) determined that the UPK3B gene contains 6 exons
spanning 5 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Deng et al. (2002) mapped the UPK3B gene
to chromosome 7q11.23 in close proximity to the PMS2L11 gene. They
suggested that PMS2L11 and UPK3B may be related by duplication of an
ancestral gene.

606078	TITLE *606078 MEGAKARYOBLASTIC LEUKEMIA 1 GENE; MKL1
;;MAL;;
MYOCARDIN-RELATED PROTEIN;;
MRTFA
MKL1/RBM15 FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Nagase et al. (2000) isolated a cDNA encoding MKL1, which they called
KIAA1438, from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA library. KIAA1438
encodes a predicted 934-amino acid protein. RT-PCR analysis detected
expression of KIAA1438 in all tissues tested, with relatively low levels
in skeletal muscle, pancreas, and spleen. KIAA1438 was expressed in all
brain regions examined. Wang et al. (2001) identified KIAA1438 as a
myocardin (606127)-related protein.

By EST database analysis and PCR, Cen et al. (2003) cloned MKL1. The
deduced 931-amino acid protein contains an N-terminal domain, followed
by a basic region, a glutamine-rich region, a SAP domain, and a
coiled-coil region. Epitope-tagged MKL1 was expressed as a nuclear
protein of about 160 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

Cen et al. (2003) found that MKL1 strongly activated serum response
element (SRE)-dependent reporter genes, and it activated the promoters
of smooth muscle alpha-actin (see 102620), cardiac alpha-actin (102540),
and SM22 (600818) more than 200-fold. RNA interference of MKL1 or MKL2
(609463) reduced serum and RhoA (165390) activation in HeLa cells, and
the combination of MKL1 and MKL2 RNA interference completely abolished
induction. Gel mobility shift assays indicated that MKL1 did not bind
the SRE alone, but formed a complex with SRF (600589).
Coimmunoprecipitation assays conformed a direct interaction between MKL1
and SRF. Deletion of the first 250 amino acids of MKL1, including the
N-terminal domain and the basic region, abolished its transcriptional
activity and caused a relocalization of the protein from the nucleus to
the cytoplasm. Transcriptional activity was also lost with C-terminal
deletions and with deletion of the basic region.

Vartiainen et al. (2007) reported a function of nuclear actin in the
regulation of MAL, a coactivator of the transcription factor SRF. MAL,
which binds monomeric actin, is cytoplasmic in many cells but
accumulated in the nucleus upon serum-induced actin polymerization. MAL
rapidly shuttled between cytoplasm and nucleus in unstimulated cells.
Serum stimulation effectively blocked MAL nuclear export, which requires
MAL-actin interaction. Nuclear MAL bound SRF target genes but remained
inactive unless actin binding was disrupted. Fluorescence resonance
energy transfer analysis demonstrated that the MAL-actin interaction
responds to extracellular signals. Vartiainen et al. (2007) concluded
that serum-induced signaling is thus communicated to nuclear actin to
control a transcriptional regulator.

In mice, Ho et al. (2013) found that lamin A/C (150330)-deficient
(Lmna-null) and Lmna(N195K/N195K) (see 150330.0007) mutant cells have
impaired nuclear translocation and downstream signaling of the
mechanosensitive transcription factor Mkl1, a myocardin family member
that is pivotal in cardiac development and function. Altered
nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of Mkl1 was caused by altered actin dynamics
in Lmna-null and Lmna(N195K/N195K) mutant cells. Ectopic expression of
the nuclear envelope protein emerin (300384), which is mislocalized in
Lmna mutant cells and also linked to Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy
(310300) and dilated cardiomyopathy, restored Mkl1 nuclear translocation
and rescued actin dynamics in mutant cells. Ho et al. (2013) concluded
that their findings presented a novel mechanism that could provide
insight into the disease etiology for the cardiac phenotype in many
laminopathies, whereby lamin A/C and emerin regulate gene expression
through modulation of nuclear and cytoskeletal actin polymerization.

- MKL1/RBM15 Fusion Protein

Cen et al. (2003) found that the MKL1/RBM15 fusion protein had a
markedly increased ability to activate SRE reporter genes.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (2000) mapped the MKL1 gene,
or KIAA1438, to chromosome 22.

CYTOGENETICS

Mercher et al. (2001) and Ma et al. (2001) demonstrated that the
recurrent t(1;22) translocation in acute megakaryocytic leukemia (AMKL,
FAB-M7) results in the fusion of 2 genes: RBM15 (606077), an
RNA-recognition motif-encoding gene with homology to the spen gene of
Drosophila, and MKL1, a gene encoding an SAP DNA-binding domain. Mercher
et al. (2001) referred to this gene as MAL, for 'megakaryocytic acute
leukemia.' Although both reciprocal fusion transcripts were expressed in
AMKL, the predicted RBM15-MKL1 chimeric protein encompasses all putative
functional motifs encoded by each gene and is thus the candidate
oncogene of t(1;22).

604871	TITLE *604871 MATRIX METALLOPROTEINASE 24; MMP24
;;MEMBRANE-TYPE MATRIX METALLOPROTEINASE 5; MT5-MMP
DESCRIPTION The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of zinc-dependent
endopeptidases that degrade the different protein components of the
extracellular matrix and basement membranes. Based on their primary
structures, substrate specificity, and cellular localization, the human
MMPs can be classified into at least 4 main subfamilies: the
collagenases, gelatinases, stromelysins, and membrane-type MMPs
(MT-MMPs). By searching an EST database for sequences similar to
previously described MMPs, Llano et al. (1999) identified MMP24, which
they called MT5-MMP. They isolated a complete MMP24 coding sequence. The
predicted 645-amino acid MMP24 protein displays a number of features
characteristic of MMPs, including a signal sequence, a prodomain with a
cysteine residue essential for maintaining latency, a catalytic domain
of approximately 170 residues that contains a consensus sequence
involved in zinc binding, and an approximately 200-amino acid segment
with sequence similarity to hemopexin (142290). In addition, MMP24
contains 3 insertions characteristic of the MT subclass of MMPs,
including a C-terminal extension consisting of putative transmembrane
and cytoplasmic domains. The authors demonstrated that recombinant MMP24
protein expressed in mammalian cells localizes to the plasma membrane.
They showed that the catalytic domain of MMP24 exhibits potent
proteolytic activity against progelatinase A (MMP2; 120360). Northern
blot analysis of normal human tissues detected an approximately 4.5-kb
MMP24 transcript predominantly in brain and slightly smaller MMP24
transcripts in kidney, pancreas, and lung. Analysis of MMP24 expression
in a variety of brain tumors, including astrocytomas, anaplastic
astrocytomas, glioblastomas, mixed gliomas, oligodendrogliomas,
ependymomas, neurocytomas, and meningiomas, indicated that MMP24 was
significantly overexpressed in several astrocytomas, anaplastic
astrocytomas, and glioblastomas, as compared to normal brain tissue. In
contrast, MMP24 was expressed at very low or undetectable levels in all
meningiomas tested.

By FISH, Llano et al. (1999) mapped the MMP24 gene to 20q11.2. By
radiation hybrid analysis and FISH, Kinoh et al. (1999) mapped the human
MMP24 gene to 20q11.2-q12 and the mouse homolog to chromosome 2.

300124	TITLE *300124 GTP-BINDING PROTEIN 6; GTPBP6
;;PSEUDOAUTOSOMAL GTP-BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE; PGPL
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Gianfrancesco et al. (1998) reported the cloning of a novel Xp/Yp
pseudoautosomal gene, which they called PGPL for 'pseudoautosomal
GTP-binding protein-like.' They demonstrated that PGPL, like other
pseudoautosomal genes, escapes X inactivation and has a functional
homolog on the Y chromosome. The gene is highly conserved across several
species and was found to be expressed in all tissues examined. The PGPL
gene encodes a protein of 442 amino acids and shows the consensus
sequences of a series of motifs of the GTP-binding protein domain.
Isolation of this gene began with the isolation of an EST from human
skeletal muscle and mapping of the EST on the X and Y chromosomes by
silver-stained denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Muraro et
al., 1997).

MAPPING

By analysis of a somatic cell hybrid panel, Gianfrancesco et al. (1998)
mapped the PGPL gene to Xp22.33, telomeric to DXS1233. Using
fluorescence in situ hybridization on normal males and on patients with
rearrangements in the pseudoautosomal region, they localized the gene
within 500 kb of the telomere. Further refinement using a cosmid contig
of the region placed this novel gene within 80 to 110 kb of the
telomere, making it the most telomeric gene on the short arms of the sex
chromosomes.

601817	TITLE *601817 NONMETASTATIC CELLS 3, PROTEIN EXPRESSED IN; NME3
;;DR-NM23;;
NONMETASTATIC PROTEIN 23, HOMOLOG OF; NM23H3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Chronic myelogenous leukemia evolves in 2 clinically distinct stages: a
chronic phase and a blast crisis phase. Venturelli et al. (1995)
identified a cDNA clone, called DR-nm23 by them, which was
differentially expressed in a blast-crisis cDNA library. The sequence
shares approximately 70% similarity with the putative metastatic
suppressor genes, nm23-H1 (NME1; 156490) and nm23-H2 (NME2; 156491). The
gene encodes a 168-amino acid polypeptide with a predicted molecular
mass of 18 kD.

Using Northern blot analysis, Martinez et al. (1997) analyzed the level
of NME3 mRNA in several human tumor cell lines. Abundant expression was
detected in all solid tumor cell lines and in erythromyeloid cell lines.
Lower expression was detected in lymphoid and monocytic cell lines.
Fluorescence-tagged NME3 showed a cytoplasmic punctate localization
following transfection in osteosarcoma cells.

Masse et al. (2002) cloned mouse Nme3, which they called nm23-M3. The
deduced 169-amino acid protein shares 88% identity with human NME3.
Northern blot analysis of several mouse tissues detected a 0.9-kb
transcript expressed at highest levels in liver and kidney, with
moderate levels in heart, brain, spleen, and lung. Little to no
expression was detected in other mouse tissues examined. In situ
hybridization of 15-day postcoitum mouse embryos showed expression in
nervous tissue and thymus.

GENE FUNCTION

Venturelli et al. (1995) found that DR-nm23 mRNA was preferentially
expressed at early stages of myeloid differentiation of highly purified
CD34(+) cells. Its constitutive expression in a myeloid precursor line,
which is growth-factor dependent for both proliferation and
differentiation, resulted in inhibition of granulocytic differentiation
induced by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (138970) and caused
apoptotic cell death. Venturelli et al. (1995) considered the results
consistent with a role for the NME3 gene in normal hematopoiesis and
raised the possibility that its overexpression contributes to
differentiation arrest, a feature of blastic transformation in chronic
myelogenous leukemia.

GENE STRUCTURE

Martinez et al. (1997) determined that the NME3 gene contains 6 exons.
The promoter region is GC rich and has a pyrimidine-rich initiator (Inr)
element, but no TATA or CAAT boxes. There are putative binding sites for
Sp1 (189906), AP2 (107580), MYB (189990), ETS (164720), GATA (see
305371) and HOX1 (see 142950). However, only AP2 was able to
transactivate the promoter and to interact with 2 putative AP2 sites.

Masse et al. (2002) determined that the mouse and human NME3 genes
contain 5 exons and span about 1.0 kb. Their promoters, like those of
other NME genes, contain several binding sites for AP2, NF1 (613113),
Sp1, LEF1 (153245), and response elements to glucocorticoid receptors
(138040). Masse et al. (2002) stated that NME3 has no pyrimidine-rich
Inr sequences.

MAPPING

By screening human-rodent hybrid cells lines and FISH, Martinez et al.
(1997) mapped the NME3 gene to chromosome 16q13.

608360	TITLE *608360 LEUCINE-RICH REPEAT-CONTAINING PROTEIN 8A; LRRC8A
;;LRRC8;;
KIAA1437
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned LRRC8, which they designated
KIAA1437. The deduced 811-amino acid protein shares 30% identity with
rat densin-180. RT-PCR ELISA detected expression within all tissues and
specific brain regions examined. Highest expression was found in adult
brain, followed by adult kidney, ovary, lung, liver, heart, and fetal
brain and liver. Within specific adult brain regions, highest expression
was detected in amygdala and caudate nucleus.

Kubota et al. (2004) noted that the human LRRC8A gene contains 810 amino
acids and shares 99% amino acid sequence identity with the mouse
ortholog. They identified 4 N-terminal transmembrane domains and 16
C-terminal extracellular leucine-rich repeats (LRRs).

GENE FUNCTION

Using semiquantitative PCR, Kubota et al. (2004) observed that mRNA
expression of LRRC8A in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was
eventually decreased by long-term stimulation by phytohemagglutinin,
contrary to the expression of other LRRC8 family members.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the LRRC8
gene to chromosome 9 (TMAP SGC34869).

Kubota et al. (2004) mapped the LRRC8A gene to chromosome 9q34.11 by
genomic sequence analysis. They localized the orthologous mouse gene to
chromosome 2.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Sawada et al. (2003) studied a girl with a balanced translocation,
t(9;20)(q33.2;q12), who had congenital agammaglobulinemia (AGM5; 613506)
and minor facial anomalies; she lacked B cells in peripheral blood and
showed epicanthic folds, mild hypertelorism, high-arched palate, and
lowered ears. Sawada et al. (2003) isolated the LRRC8 gene at the
translocation site on chromosome 9. The LRRC8 gene has 4 transmembrane
helices with 1 isolated and 8 sequentially located leucine-rich repeats
(LRRs). It was expressed on T cells as well as on B-lineage cells. The
translocation truncated the LRRC8 gene, resulting in deletion of the
eighth, ninth, and half of the seventh LRR domains (608360.0001) located
close to the C terminus. Protein products derived from the truncated
gene were coexpressed on white blood cells with the intact LRRC8 protein
from the untranslocated allele. Transplantation experiments with murine
bone marrow cells that were forced to express the truncated LRRC8 showed
that expression of the truncated protein inhibited B cell development,
producing a dominant-negative effect. The results indicated that LRRC8
is required for B cell development.

Conley (2003) commented on the variety of genes in which mutations can
cause congenital agammaglobulinemia through failure of B-cell
development. The genes encode components of the pre-B cell receptor or
proteins that are activated by crosslinking of the pre-B cell receptor.
Defects in these genes result in a block in B-cell differentiation at
the pro-B to pre-B cell transition. The defect in the LRRC8 gene in the
patient described by Sawada et al. (2003) caused a block at exactly the
same point in B-cell differentiation.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
AGAMMAGLOBULINEMIA 5 (1 family)
LRRC8A, 1-BP INS, 2681T, TRANSLOCATION 20

In a patient with agammaglobulinemia-5 (613506), Sawada et al. (2003)
identified a reciprocal translocation, t(9;20)(q33.2;q12), and
demonstrated truncation of the LRRC8A gene, which was located at the
chromosome 9 breakpoint. The truncation resulted in deletion of the
eighth, ninth, and half of the seventh LRR domains located close to the
C terminus. The truncated gene encoded 754 amino acides, including 719
derived from exon 1 of the LRCC8A gene. In white cells, protein products
derived from the truncated gene were coexpressed with the intact LRRC8A
protein from the untranslocated allele. Experiments in mouse bone marrow
cells indicated that the truncated protein inhibited B-cell development.
A dominant-negative mechanism for expression of the defect in the
heterozygote was proposed.

600868	TITLE *600868 SIGNAL SEQUENCE RECEPTOR, ALPHA; SSR1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Transport of secretory and membrane proteins across the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) is thought to be mediated by a complex protein structure
in the membrane called the translocon. SSR1 encodes the alpha subunit of
the translocon-associated membrane protein (TRAP) complex and is found
in close proximity of nascent polypeptide chains translocating across
the ER membrane (summary by Hartmann and Prehn, 1994).

CLONING

By screening a HeLa cell cDNA library using canine TRAP-alpha as probe,
Hartmann and Prehn (1994) cloned human SSR1, which they called
TRAP-alpha. The deduced 286-amino acid human protein contains an
N-terminal signal sequence, followed by an acidic region, 2
glycosylation sites, a transmembrane domain, and 2 basic regions near
the C terminus. Human and canine TRAP-alpha share 96% amino acid
sequence identity. Hartmann and Prehn (1994) also identified TRAP-alpha
sequences in trout, A. thaliana, and rice.

Using RACE, Hirama et al. (1999) cloned full-length human TRAP-alpha, as
well as several variants resulting from alternative polyadenylation.
None of the predicted polyadenylation signals in the TRAP-alpha
transcripts were canonical. The deduced full-length TRAP-alpha protein
contains 286 amino acids. Northern blot analysis of the human myeloid
and osteosarcoma cell lines detected a 3.3-kb TRAP-alpha transcript and
several smaller transcripts.

GENE FUNCTION

Using differential display, Hirama et al. (1999) found that TRAP-alpha
was induced in a growth factor-dependent human myeloid cell line after
stimulation with GMCSF (CSF2; 138960). Cell cycle analysis of human
osteosarcoma cells showed that TRAP-alpha was downregulated in quiescent
cells.

MAPPING

Using radiation hybrid analysis, Hirama et al. (1999) mapped the SSR1
gene to chromosome 6p. Gross (2012) mapped the SSR1 gene to chromosome
6p24.3 based on an alignment of the SSR1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK
AF156965) with the genomic sequence (GRCh37).

123690	TITLE *123690 CRYSTALLIN, GAMMA-D; CRYGD
;;CRYSTALLIN, GAMMA-4; CRYG4
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The crystallin proteins alpha (see 123660), beta (see 123610), and gamma
account for more than 90% of total lens proteins. Different
gamma-crystallin isoforms account for approximately one-third of total
lens proteins (Bloemendal et al., 2004).

MAPPING

Shiloh et al. (1986) localized the gamma-crystallin genes to 2q33-q36,
most probably 2q34-q35, by Southern analysis of DNA from somatic cell
hybrids and by in situ hybridization.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a 3-generation family with hereditary progressive cataracts (115700),
Stephan et al. (1999) performed a genomewide search and obtained
evidence for linkage at chromosome 2q33-q35, where the gamma-crystallin
genes are located. They then looked for mutations in 2 gamma-crystallins
that are expressed at high levels in the developing lens, mainly
gamma-crystallins C (CRYGC; 123680) and D. They discovered a 1-base
alteration that resulted in an arg14-to-cys substitution in
gamma-D-crystallin (123690.0001). Protein modeling suggested that the
effect of this mutation was a subtle one, affecting the surface
properties of the crystallin molecule rather than its tertiary
structure, consistent with the fact that the patients' lenses were
normal at birth. This was the first gene defect shown to be responsible
for a noncongenital progressive cataract.

In affected members of 3 families segregating aculeiform cataract, Heon
et al. (1999) identified an arg58-to-his (R58H; 123690.0002) mutation in
the CRYGD gene.

Kmoch et al. (2000) described a 5-year-old boy with a unique congenital
cataract caused by deposition of numerous birefringent, pleochroic, and
macroscopically prismatic crystals. Crystal analysis with subsequent
Edman degradation and mass spectrometry identified the protein as
gamma-D-crystallin lacking the N-terminal methionine. Sequencing of the
CRYGD gene revealed heterozygosity for a C-to-A transversion at position
109 of the inferred cDNA, resulting in an arg36-to-ser substitution
(R36S; 123690.0003). Although the crystal structure solution at 2.25
angstroms suggested that mutant R36S CRYGD has an unaltered protein
fold, the observed crystal packing was possible only with the mutant
protein molecules lacking the bulky arg36 side chain. This was the first
described case of human cataract caused by crystallization of a protein
in the lens.

Pande et al. (2001) used the term crystal cataract for those produced by
mutation in the CRYGD gene with demonstrable crystallization of the
mutant protein. They showed that the R58H (123690.0002) and R36S
(123690.0003) mutant proteins are much less soluble than wildtype human
gamma-D-crystallin protein. They also showed that these mutants are more
prone to crystallization than the wildtype.

In a father and daughter with congenital lamellar cataract, Santhiya et
al. (2002) identified a heterozygous missense mutation in the CRYGD gene
(P23T; 123690.0004).

Nandrot et al. (2003) found P23T mutation in the CRYGD gene in a
4-generation Moroccan family with autosomal dominant congenital cerulean
cataract. The authors showed that although x-ray crystallography
modeling did not indicate any change of the backbone conformation, the
mutation affected a region of the Greek key motif that was important for
determining the topology of this protein fold. The data strongly
suggested that the P23T mutation might alter the protein folding or
decrease the thermodynamic stability or solubility of the protein.

A different mutation in the same codon (P23S; 123690.0007) was found by
Plotnikova et al. (2007) to be the basis of the polymorphic congenital
cataract reported by Rogaev et al. (1996) in a central Asian population
of mixed white and Mongolian ancestry. The cataract-associated serine at
site 23 corresponds to the ancestral state, since it was found in CRYGD
of a lower primate (S. labiatus) and all surveyed nonprimate mammals.
Crystallin proteins include 2 structurally similar domains, and
substitutions in mammalian CRYGD protein at site 23 of the first domain
were always associated with substitutions in the structurally reciprocal
sites 109 and 136 of the second domain. These data suggested that the
cataractogenic effect of serine at site 23 in the N-terminal domain of
CRYGD may be compensated indirectly by amino acid changes in a distal
domain. Plotnikova et al. (2007) also found that gene conversion was a
factor in the evolution of the gamma-crystallin gene cluster throughout
different mammalian clades. The high rate of gene conversion observed
between the functional CRYGD gene and 2 primate gamma-crystallin
pseudogenes (CRYGEP1 and CRYGFP1) coupled with a surprising finding of
apparent negative selection in primate pseudogenes suggested a
deleterious impact of recently derived pseudogenes involved in gene
conversion in gamma-crystallin gene cluster.

McManus et al. (2007) found that CRYGD proteins with cataract-associated
mutations of pro23 became less soluble as temperature increased, in
dramatic contrast to the native protein. As a result, the mutant
proteins had much lower solubilities at body temperature than the native
protein.

In affected members of a Danish family segregating autosomal dominant
congenital cataract and microcornea, Hansen et al. (2007) identified a
heterozygous nonsense mutation in the CRYGD gene (Y134X; 123690.0008).

- Nomenclature of Allelic Variants

Hansen et al. (2007) noted that until September 2007 the systematic name
for all CRYGD mutations (except the E107A mutation) used the N-terminal
processed CRYGD protein, which starts with glycine at position 2 in the
translated mRNA. Based on the numbering system established by den Dunnen
and Antonarakis (2001), however, the first methionine in the coding
sequence should be assigned position 1, and the adenosine in the
corresponding start ATG codon should be assigned position +1. This
change in numbering is reflected in the relevant allelic variants
included below.

ANIMAL MODEL

In an ongoing program to identify new mouse models of hereditary eye
disease, Smith et al. (2000) identified a semidominant form of cataract
consisting of an irregular opacity of the nuclear lens thought to be
similar to the human Coppock cataract (see 604307). The cataract
phenotype mapped to mouse chromosome 1 in the vicinity of the
gamma-crystallin gene cluster. Using a systemic candidate gene approach
to analyze the entire Cryg cluster, a G-to-A transition was found in
exon 3 of Crygd associated with the Lop12 mutation. The mutation led to
the formation of an in-frame stop codon that produced a truncated
protein of 156 amino acids. It was predicted that the defective gene
product would alter protein folding of the gamma-crystallins and result
in lens opacity.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CATARACT 4, PUNCTATE
CRYGD, ARG15CYS

Based on a new numbering system, this variant has been changed from
ARG14CYS to ARG15CYS; see Hansen et al. (2007).

Stephan et al. (1999) found an arg14-to-cys (R14C) missense mutation in
the CRYGD gene in affected members of a family with autosomal dominant
punctate cataract of early postnatal onset and progressive nature
(CTRCT4; 115700).

To gain understanding of how the R14C mutation leads to cataract, Pande
et al. (2000) expressed recombinant wildtype human gamma-D crystallin
and its R14C mutant form in Escherichia coli and showed that R14C forms
disulfide-linked oligomers, which markedly raised the phase separation
temperature of the protein solution. Eventually, R14C precipitated. In
contrast, the wildtype version slowly formed only disulfide-linked
dimers and no oligomers. These data strongly suggested that the observed
cataract is triggered by the thiol-mediated aggregation of R14C. The
aggregation profiles of the wildtype and mutant forms were consistent
with homology modeling studies that revealed that R14C contains 2
exposed cysteine residues, whereas wildtype has only 1. Studies showed
that the wildtype and R14C mutant forms had nearly identical secondary
and tertiary structures and stabilities. Thus, contrary to commonly held
views at the time, Pande et al. (2000) concluded that unfolding or
destabilization of the protein was not necessary for cataractogenesis.

.0002
CATARACT 4, ACULEIFORM
CRYGD, ARG59HIS

Based on a new numbering system, this variant has been changed from
ARG58HIS to ARG59HIS; see Hansen et al. (2007).

Heon et al. (1999) found that a G-to-A transition at nucleotide 411 of
the CRYGD gene, resulting in an arg58-to-his substitution, segregated
with the phenotype of aculeiform cataract (CTRCT4; 115700) in 3 affected
families.

.0003
CATARACT 4, CRYSTALLINE
CRYGD, ARG37SER

Based on a new numbering system, this variant has been changed from
ARG36SER to ARG37SER; see Hansen et al. (2007).

Kmoch et al. (2000) described a 5-year-old boy with a juvenile-onset
crystalline cataract (CTRCT4; 115700) caused by deposition of numerous
birefringent, pleochroic, and macroscopically prismatic crystals.
Protein analysis identified the material as gamma-D-crystallin, and
sequencing of the CRYGD gene revealed heterozygosity for a C-to-A
transversion at position 109 of the inferred cDNA, resulting in an
arg36-to-ser substitution.

.0004
CATARACT 4, MULTIPLE TYPES
CRYGD, PRO24THR

Based on a new numbering system, this variant has been changed from
PRO23THR to PRO24THR; see Hansen et al. (2007).

In a father and daughter with congenital lamellar cataracts (CTRCT4;
115700), Santhiya et al. (2002) identified heterozygosity for a 70C-A
transversion in exon 2 of the CRYGD gene, predicted to lead to a
pro23-to-thr (P23T) substitution.

In a 4-generation Moroccan family with congenital cerulean cataract,
Nandrot et al. (2003) found that a C-to-A transversion in exon 2 of the
CRYGD gene, resulting in a P23T substitution, segregated with the
phenotype. The authors indicated the nucleotide change as 305C-A but
noted that this was the same mutation as that found by Santhiya et al.
(2002).

.0005
CATARACT 4, CENTRAL NUCLEAR
CRYGD, TRP157TER

Based on a new numbering system, this variant has been changed from
TRP156TER to TRP157TER; see Hansen et al. (2007).

In a father and daughter with congenital central nuclear cataract
(CTRCT4; 115700), Santhiya et al. (2002) found heterozygosity for a
nonsense mutation in the CRYGD gene: a 470G-A transition leading to a
premature stop at codon 156 (W156X).

.0006
MOVED TO 123690.0004
.0007
CATARACT 4, NONNUCLEAR POLYMORPHIC CONGENITAL
CRYGD, PRO24SER

Based on a new numbering system, this variant has been changed from
PRO23SER to PRO24SER; see Hansen et al. (2007).

In a large kindred of mixed white and Mongolian origin with polymorphic
congenital cataract (CTRCT4; 115700), Plotnikova et al. (2007) found a
70C-T transition in exon 2 of the CRYGD gene that resulted in a
pro23-to-ser (P23S) substitution.

.0008
CATARACT 4 WITH MICROCORNEA
CRYGD, TYR134TER

In affected members of a Danish family segregating autosomal dominant
congenital cataract and microcornea (CTRCT4; 115700), Hansen et al.
(2007) identified heterozygosity for a c.418C-A transversion in exon 3
of the CRYGD gene, resulting in a tyr134-to-ter (Y134X) substitution.
The mutation was not found in 170 ethnically matched controls.

606162	TITLE *606162 PANTOTHENATE KINASE 4; PANK4
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Pantothenate kinase (EC 2.7.2.33) is an essential regulatory enzyme in
CoA biosynthesis, catalyzing the cytosolic phosphorylation of
pantothenate (vitamin B5), N-pantothenoylcysteine, and pantetheine. CoA
is the major acyl carrier, playing a central role in intermediary and
fatty acid metabolism. In both yeast and fly, each with only 1
pantothenate kinase gene, the null mutant is inviable (summary by Zhou
et al., 2001).

CLONING

Zhou et al. (2001) demonstrated that mutations in the pantothenate
kinase-2 gene (PANK2; 606157) cause pantothenate kinase-associated
neurodegeneration (PKAN; 234200); in related studies, they sequenced the
PANK1 (606160), PANK3 (606161), and PANK4 genes. PANK4 was expressed in
all tissues tested, with highest expression in muscle.

MAPPING

Zhou et al. (2001) stated that the PANK4 gene is located on chromosome
1p36.

608055	TITLE *608055 CYTOCHROME P450, SUBFAMILY IIA, POLYPEPTIDE 13; CYP2A13
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Fernandez-Salguero et al. (1995) cloned 3 complete CYP2A genes, CYP2A6
(122720), CYP2A7 (608054), and CYP2A13, in addition to 2 pseudogenes
truncated after exon 5, all of which are located in a 350-kb region on
chromosome 19q13.2. The deduced CYP2A13 protein contains 494 amino
acids.

Using RT-PCR, Su et al. (2000) cloned CYP2A13 from human nasal mucosa
total RNA. RT-PCR detected highest CYP2A13 expression in nasal mucosa,
followed by lung and trachea. Lower expression was detected in testis
and liver, and weak expression was detected in brain, mammary gland,
prostate, and uterus, but not in other tissues examined.

GENE FUNCTION

CYP2A13 may play important roles in xenobiotic toxicity and
tobacco-related tumorigenesis in the respiratory tract (Su et al.,
2000).

Su et al. (2000) found that in vitro-translated CYP2A13 metabolized many
of the same carcinogens and toxicants as liver microsomal CYP2A6.
However, compared with CYP2A6, it showed much lower activity against
coumarin and much higher activity against
4(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK), a major
tobacco-specific carcinogen.

GENE STRUCTURE

Fernandez-Salguero et al. (1995) determined that the CYP2A13 gene
contains 9 exons.

MAPPING

Fernandez-Salguero et al. (1995) determined the structural organization
of the CYP2 gene cluster, which spans 350 kb on chromosome 19q13.2. They
also determined the directions of transcription.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Zhang et al. (2002) identified a C-to-T polymorphism (arg257 to cys) in
exon 5 of the CYP2A13 gene. The product of this variant was 37 to 56%
less active than the wildtype protein toward all substrates tested.

605088	TITLE *605088 MAJOR VAULT PROTEIN, RAT, HOMOLOG OF; MVP
;;LUNG RESISTANCE-RELATED PROTEIN; LRP
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Vaults are hollow intracellular organelles with dimensions of about 57
by 32 nm and a nuclear mass of about 13 MD, 3 times the size of a
ribosome. They are composed of a small RNA (VTRNA1-1; 612695), the
100-kD major vault protein (MVP), and minor vault proteins of 193 kD
(PARP4; 607519) and 240 kD (TEP1; 601686). MVP accounts for over 70% of
the particle mass (Izquierdo et al., 1996; Kickhoefer et al., 1999).

CLONING

Multidrug-resistant (MDR) cancer cells frequently overexpress the 110-kD
lung resistance-related protein (LRP). Overexpression of LRP often
predicts a poor response to chemotherapy. By screening a
multidrug-resistant non-P-glycoprotein (see ABCB1; 171050) fibrosarcoma
cell line with an LRP-specific monoclonal antibody, Scheffer et al.
(1995) isolated a cDNA encoding LRP. The deduced 896-amino acid LRP
protein shares 88% amino acid identity with the rat major vault protein
(Mvp). RNase protection assays showed that LRP expression was enhanced
4- to 8-fold in non-P-glycoprotein MDR cell lines.

Using immunohistochemical analysis, Izquierdo et al. (1996) found that
LRP was widely expressed in normal and tumor tissues and showed a
characteristic cytoplasmic granular pattern. High LRP expression was
detected in the epithelial lining of bronchioles and upper and lower
digestive tract, renal proximal tubules, epidermal keratinocytes and
melanocytes, macrophages, and adrenal cortex. Lower and variable
expression of LRP was detected in other tissues. LRP was expressed in
all tumor types tested, and its level of expression fairly reflected the
chemosensitivity of the tumors, with lower expression in highly
chemosensitive tumors. Immunoprecipitated LRP had an apparent molecular
mass of 110 kD by SDS-PAGE.

By EST database analysis, Holzmann et al. (2001) identified a long MVP
splice variant, L-MVP, that contains a 41-bp stretch in the 5-prime
region that is intronic in the shorter S-MVP splice variant. This 41-bp
stretch introduces an upstream ORF encoding a deduced 18-amino acid
peptide. RT-PCR detected ubiquitous expression of both variants, and
S-MVP was always the major variant.

Van Zon et al. (2002) identified a central calcium-binding EF-hand motif
and a C-terminal coiled-coil domain in MVP.

Using confocal immunocytochemistry with anti-MVP antibody, Slesina et
al. (2005) found a dense distribution of vault particles in the
cytoplasm of human U373 astroglioma cell line. A punctate staining
pattern was also detected in the nucleus. Cryoimmunoelectron microscopy
revealed clusters of immunogold particles at nuclear pores and in the
nucleoplasm, suggesting that nuclear MVP was also associated with
vaults. Quantification of fluorescent MVP in the cytosol and nucleus of
U373 cells revealed about 5% of MVP in the nucleus.

GENE FUNCTION

Kickhoefer et al. (1998) found that expression of MVP and VTRNA1-1 and
assembly of vaults increased up to 15-fold in several drug-resistant
cell lines compared with the parental cell lines. They hypothesized that
the absolute vault level in cell lines may dictate the extent of drug
resistance.

Abbondanza et al. (1998) found that MVP coprecipitated with estrogen
receptor (ER, or ESR1; 133430) from nuclear extracts of MCF-7 human
breast cancer cells and that ER associated with intact vaults. Mutation
analysis showed that a central region of ER containing nuclear
localization signals was involved in the interaction. A limited amount
of ER molecules in the nuclear extract appeared to be associated with
MVP. Physiologic concentrations of estradiol increased the amount of MVP
present in MCF-7 nuclear extracts and coimmunoprecipitated with ER. The
hormone-dependent interaction of vaults with ER was reproduced in vitro.
Antibodies to progesterone receptor (PGR; 607311) and glucocorticoid
receptor (GCCR; 138040) also coimmunoprecipitated MVP, but more weakly.

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis and by in vitro binding assays with
recombinant proteins, Kickhoefer et al. (1999) confirmed direct
interaction between MVP and PARP4, which they called VPARP. The
C-terminal domain was the smallest sequence of PARP4 that could bind
MVP. The PARP-like catalytic domain, when expressed as a recombinant
protein in E. coli, showed ADP-ribosylase activity. Vault particles
purified from rat liver and incubated with radiolabeled NAD showed
prominent ADP-ribosylation of Mvp and some automodification of Parp4.

Holzmann et al. (2001) showed that in vitro translation of L-MVP was low
relative to translation of S-MVP. Mutation of the start codon of the
upstream ORF in the L-MVP transcript reversed the suppression of MVP
translation, suggesting that translation of the upstream ORF controls
expression of the larger protein.

Using yeast 2- and 3-hybrid analysis and mutation analysis, van Zon et
al. (2002) found that MVP molecules interacted with each other via their
coiled-coil domains. MVP also bound calcium, likely via its EF-hand
motif. The N-terminal half of MVP bound a C-terminal domain of VPARP,
but TEP1 did not appear to interact with either MVP or VPARP.

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen, Yu et al. (2002) showed that MPV
interacted with PTEN (601728), a protein phosphatase that can function
as a tumor suppressor. Endogenous PTEN associated with vault particles
isolated from HeLa cells. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis confirmed the
interaction between PTEN and MVP. Deletion analysis mapped the
interacting regions to the C2 domain of PTEN and the EF-hand motifs of
MVP. The interaction was independent of tyrosine phosphorylation, but
required calcium, consistent with a calcium-induced conformational
change in the MVP EF-hand motifs.

Using human airway epithelial cells, Kowalski et al. (2007) showed that
MVP accumulated rapidly into lipid rafts during Pseudomonas aeruginosa
infection, and this accumulation was markedly reduced in cells from
cystic fibrosis (219700) patients expressing the delF508 mutation
(602421.0001) in CFTR (602421). Immunofluorescence microscopy and
coimmunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated colocalization of
bacteria, CFTR, and MVP, without direct physical association. The outer
core oligosaccharide of P. aeruginosa bound CFTR and was required for
recruitment of MVP to lipid rafts. Small interfering RNA-mediated
knockdown of MVP decreased recruitment of MVP to lipid rafts following
P. aeruginosa infection without affecting NFKB (see 164011) activation,
IL8 (146930) secretion, or apoptosis induction, suggesting a key role
for MVP in bacterial uptake.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lange et al. (2000) determined that the MVP gene contains 15 exons. They
found that the promoter region has an inverted CCAAT box but no TATA
box. They identified several putative promoter binding sites including
an SP1 (189901)-binding site located close to a p53 (191170)-binding
motif. An alternative 3-prime splice site of intron 1 results in a
splicing variant within the 5-prime untranslated region of MVP mRNA.

MAPPING

By FISH, Scheffer et al. (1995) mapped the LRP gene to chromosome
16p13.1-p11.2, in the same chromosomal region as the MDR-associated
genes MRP (ABCC1; 158343) and PRKCB1 (176970). The authors noted that
acute myeloid leukemia patients with a deletion of an MRP gene,
resulting from a chromosome 16 inversion, often have a favorable
outcome.

ANIMAL MODEL

Kowalski et al. (2007) found that Mvp -/- mice infected with P.
aeruginosa internalized fewer bacteria in lung epithelial cells than
wildtype mice, resulting in increased bacterial burden in the lung. Mvp
-/- mice also had increased mortality after P. aeruginosa infection.
Kowalski et al. (2007) concluded that MVP contributes to resistance
against P. aeruginosa lung infection.

;;MITOCHONDRIAL MALONYLTRANSFERASE;;
MT, MITOCHONDRIAL
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MCAT (EC 2.3.1.39) is the catalytic subunit of the type II
malonyl-CoA-dependent system for biosynthesis of fatty acids in
mitochondria (Zhang et al., 2003).

CLONING

Zhang et al. (2003) cloned human MCAT, which they called mitochondrial
MT. The deduced 390-amino acid protein has an N-terminal cleavable
mitochondrial targeting signal, a GxSxG serine esterase active-site
motif, and conserved arg and his residues required for activity.
Fluorescence-tagged MCAT colocalized with a mitochondrial marker
following expression in HeLa cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Zhang et al. (2003) found that human mitochondrial MT expressed in
insect cells had a narrower substrate specificity than cytosolic MT
(FASN; 600212) and transferred a malonyl moiety to the mitochondrial
malonyl acceptor ACP (NDUFAB1; 603836) only.

GENE STRUCTURE

Zhang et al. (2003) determined that the MCAT gene contains 4 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Zhang et al. (2003) mapped the MCAT gene
to chromosome 22q13.31.

;;RING FINGER- AND KH DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1; RKHD1;;
TINO;;
KIAA2031
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By yeast 3-hybrid screening of a placenta cDNA library using an AU-rich
element (ARE) of BCL2 (151430) as bait, Donnini et al. (2004) obtained a
partial cDNA encoding RKHD1, which they called TINO. The predicted
490-amino acid partial protein has 2 N-terminal ribonucleoprotein K
(HNRNPK; 600712) homology (KH) domains and a C-terminal RING domain, and
it shares similarity with C. elegans Mex3. Donnini et al. (2004) also
identified a partial cDNA, KIAA2031, that may represent a TINO splice
variant. RACE and database analyses suggested that the full-length TINO
protein contains 651 amino acids. Northern blot analysis detected a
3.1-kb transcript in all tissues examined, with highest expression in
placenta. A 6.5-kb transcript was also present in heart and skeletal
muscle. Immunofluorescence analysis of HeLa cells localized endogenous
TINO predominantly in the nucleus and perinuclear region.

C. elegans Mex3 is a regulator of translation that specifies posterior
blastomere identity in the early embryo and contributes to the
maintenance of germline totipotency. By database analysis and RT-PCR,
Buchet-Poyau et al. (2007) cloned a family of 4 human genes homologous
to C. elegans Mex3, including RKHD1, which they called MEX3D. Like the
other human MEX3 proteins, the deduced 651-amino acid MEX3D protein has
an N-terminal nuclear export signal (NES), 2 KH domains, and a
C-terminal RING finger domain. The KH domains are present in C. elegans
Mex3, but not the RING domain. RT-PCR detected ubiquitous expression of
MEX3D in human tissues and cell lines.

GENE FUNCTION

Using yeast 3-hybrid and gel-shift assays, Donnini et al. (2004) showed
that TINO interacted with an ARE of BCL2 in vitro and in vivo. Upon
binding, TINO destabilized a chimeric reporter construct containing the
BCL2 ARE, revealing a negative regulatory action on BCL2 expression at
the posttranscriptional level.

GENE STRUCTURE

Donnini et al. (2004) determined that the RKHD1 gene contains 3 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Donnini et al. (2004) mapped the MEX3D
gene to chromosome 19p13.3.

176391	TITLE *176391 PREGNANCY-SPECIFIC BETA-1-GLYCOPROTEIN 2; PSG2
;;PSBG2;;
PSGGB
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The human pregnancy-specific glycoproteins (PSGs) are a family of
proteins that are synthesized in large amounts by placental trophoblasts
and released into the maternal circulation during pregnancy. Molecular
cloning and analysis of several PSG genes has indicated that the PSGs
form a subgroup of the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) gene family, which
belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily of genes. Members of the CEA
family consist of a single N domain, with structural similarity to the
immunoglobulin variable domains, followed by a variable number of
immunoglobulin constant-like A and/or B domains. Most PSGs have an
arg-gly-asp (RGD) motif, which has been shown to function as an adhesion
recognition signal for several integrins, in the N-terminal domain
(summary by Teglund et al., 1994).

For additional general information about the PSG gene family, see PSG1
(176390).

CLONING

Teglund et al. (1994) stated that the PSG2 sequence (GenBank GENBANK
M20882) was originally identified by Streydio et al. (1988).

GENE STRUCTURE

Teglund et al. (1994) determined that the PSG2 gene contains 6 exons.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Trask et al. (1993) assigned the
PSG2 gene to 19q13.2. They assigned PSG3 (176392), PSG4 (176393), PSG5
(176394), and PSG8 (176397) to the same band and PSG13 (176401) to
19q13.1-q13.2. Studies by several groups resulted in the mapping of the
CEA gene family to 19q13.1-q13.2 (Thompson et al., 1990; Thompson et
al., 1992; Tynan et al., 1992; Trask et al., 1993). The PSG subgroup is
located telomeric of the CEA subgroup, and together they span
approximately 1.1 to 1.2 Mb (Brandriff et al., 1992; Tynan et al.,
1992). Using a high-resolution restriction fragment fingerprinting
technique, Olsen et al. (1994) assembled 256 cosmids spanning the PSG
region on 19q13.2 into a single 700-kb contig. FISH to sperm pronuclei
and cosmid walking experiments indicated that this PSG contig is
telomeric of CGM8 at the telomeric end of the CEA subgroup gene cluster.
Detailed restriction mapping and hybridization with gene-specific probes
indicated that the order of the 11 PSG genes in the contig is
cen--PSG3--PSG8--PSG12 (PSG10; 176399)--PSG1--PSG6 (176395)--PSG7
(176396)--PSG13 (PSG11)--PSG2--PSG5--PSG4--PSG11 (PSG9; 176398)--tel.
The PSG genes are tandemly oriented in a 5-prime to 3-prime direction
from telomere to centromere. The CEA subgroup gene CGM11 is located at
the telomeric end of the PSG gene cluster, and 6 genes belonging to a
third CEA family subgroup, namely CGM13 through CGM18 (later found to be
pseudogenes; see 109770), are interspersed among the PSG genes.

NOMENCLATURE

Beauchemin et al. (1999) provided a revised nomenclature for the CEA
gene family. Based on this nomenclature, the CEA family is composed of
the PSG subfamily, the CEACAM subfamily (see 109770), and the CEACAM
pseudogene (CEACAMP) subfamily (see 109770). PSG11, PSG12, and PSG13
were renamed PSG9, PSG10, and PSG11, respectively.

600576	TITLE *600576 GATA-BINDING PROTEIN 4; GATA4
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The GATA-binding proteins are a group of structurally related
transcription factors that control gene expression and differentiation
in a variety of cell types. Members of this family of DNA-binding
proteins recognize a consensus sequence known as the 'GATA' motif, which
is an important cis-element in the promoters of many genes (Arceci et
al., 1993). All GATA-binding proteins contain 1 or 2 zinc finger motifs
of the distinctive form CXNCX(17)CNXC (Evans et al., 1988). GATA1
(305371), the founding member of the family, is expressed in erythroid
cells, megakaryocytes, and other hematopoietic cells. It regulates
expression of genes critical for erythroid development, such as the
globin genes. GATA2 (137295) is expressed in hematopoietic cells and
numerous other cell types. This factor has been implicated in the
regulation of endothelial gene expression and hematopoiesis. GATA3
(131320) is expressed in brain and T cells and appears to control
expression of T-cell receptor genes. A fourth member of the GATA-binding
family, GATA4, is expressed in adult vertebrate heart, gut epithelium,
and gonads. During fetal development, GATA4 is expressed in yolk sac
endoderm and cells involved in heart formation (Arceci et al., 1993).
Promoter and enhancer studies suggested that this factor may regulate
genes critical for myocardial differentiation and function, including
troponin C (191040), cardiac alpha-myosin heavy chain (MYH6; 160710),
and brain-type natriuretic factor (600295) (Durocher et al., 1997).

CLONING

Arceci et al. (1993) cloned the mouse GATA4 cDNA by screening a 6.5-day
embryonic library with primers based on the conserved zinc finger
domains. The 50-kD predicted protein contains 2 zinc fingers and, when
expressed in cell culture, activated appropriate reporter constructs.

By screening a human heart cDNA library, Huang et al. (1995) isolated a
full-length cDNA clone for GATA4. Northern blot analysis revealed that
the 4.4-kb transcript was more highly expressed in adult heart than in
fetal heart. They concluded that GATA4 may regulate a set of
cardiac-specific genes and play a crucial role in cardiogenesis.

MAPPING

By Southern blot analyses of genomic DNAs from human/rodent somatic cell
hybrid lines, White et al. (1995) mapped the GATA4 gene to the proximal
region of 8p. Huang et al. (1996) used fluorescence in situ
hybridization to assign the human GATA4 gene to 8p23.1-p22.

By analysis of genomic DNAs from an interspecific backcross, White et
al. (1995) mapped the mouse Gata4 gene to chromosome 14, closely linked
to the locus for clusterin (185430). This mapping assignment placed the
Gata4 gene in the vicinity of the mouse Ds (disorganization) locus, a
dominant gain-of-function mutation affecting embryonic development.
White et al. (1995) speculated that Ds is caused by a mutation in the
Gata4 gene, ectopic expression of Gata-4, or a mutation in another
lineage determination gene closely linked to Gata4.

GENE FUNCTION

Molkentin et al. (1994) reported that GATA4 regulates the expression of
MYH6. They identified a GATA motif located within the proximal promoter
region of the MYH6 gene. Huang et al. (1995) likewise identified a
putative GATA-binding site within the 5-prime flanking sequence of the
MYH6 gene.

Hasegawa et al. (1997) presented evidence implicating GATA4 as a
mediator of changes in gene expression associated with cardiac
hypertrophy. The authors injected a luciferase reporter construct driven
by the cardiac beta-myosin heavy chain (MYH7; 160760) promoter region
into rat myocardium in vivo. Cardiac hypertrophy was induced by surgical
aortic constriction. Reporter gene expression in hypertrophic myocardium
after 23 days was 3 times higher than that in sham controls (P less than
0.005); however, mutation of the GATA motif markedly reduced this
response. Hasegawa et al. (1997) concluded that interaction between
GATA4 and the GATA element plays a role in the transcriptional
activation of MYH7 during pressure overload cardiac hypertrophy.

Similar evidence implicating GATA4 as a mediator of cardiac hypertrophy
was presented by Herzig et al. (1997). Using a luciferase reporter gene
containing the AGTR1 promoter (106165), Herzig et al. (1997)
demonstrated a 1.6-fold increase in luciferase activity in cardiac
muscle removed from rats with surgically induced cardiac hypertrophy.
The authors reported greatly increased GATA4 DNA binding to the AGTR1
promoter in hypertrophied myocardium. These effects were abolished by
the introduction of a mutation into the GATA consensus sequence within
the AGTR1 promoter.

Laitinen et al. (2000) examined the expression of GATA4 and GATA6
(601656) in human ovaries, human granulosa-luteal (GL) cells, and sex
cord-derived tumors. They showed by in situ hybridization and
immunohistochemistry that GATA4 and GATA6 mRNA and GATA4 protein are
present in granulosa and theca cells in both preantral and antral
follicles. Both human ovarian tissue samples and freshly isolated GL
cells derived from preovulatory follicles of gonadotropin-treated women
expressed GATA4, GATA6, and FOG2 (603693) transcripts, and GATA6 mRNA
expression in GL cell cultures was stimulated by human CG (see 118860)
and 8-bromo-cAMP. The vast majority of granulosa and theca cell tumors
examined expressed GATA4 and GATA6. They also found that mRNA for FOG2,
a regulator of GATA4, is coexpressed with GATA4 in human ovary samples,
normal granulosa cells, and in sex cord-derived tumors. The authors
concluded that their findings support a role for GATA-binding proteins
in human ovarian folliculogenesis. Moreover, they suggested that GATA
factors may contribute to the phenotypes of sex cord-derived ovarian
tumors.

Vaskivuo et al. (2001) investigated the extent and localization of
apoptosis in human fetal (aged 13 to 40 weeks) and adult ovaries. They
also studied the expression of transcription factor GATA4. Apoptosis was
found in ovarian follicles throughout fetal and adult life. During fetal
development, apoptosis was localized mainly to primary oocytes and was
highest between weeks 14 and 28, decreasing thereafter toward term.
During fetal ovarian development, GATA4 mRNA and protein were localized
to the granulosa cells, with expression being highest in the youngest
ovaries and decreasing somewhat toward term. The authors concluded that
the expression pattern of GATA4 suggests that it may be involved in the
mechanisms protecting granulosa cells from apoptosis from fetal to adult
life.

Anttonen et al. (2005) studied the role of factors regulating normal
granulosa cell function, i.e., anti-mullerian hormone (AMH; 600957),
inhibin-alpha (147380), steroidogenic factor-1 (SF1; 184757), and GATA
transcription factors in the pathobiology and clinical behavior of
granulosa cell tumors (GCTs). The more aggressive GCTs retained a high
GATA4 expression, whereas the larger tumors lost the
proliferation-suppressing AMH expression. The authors concluded that the
high GATA4 expression in GCTs may serve as a marker of poor prognosis.

Ketola et al. (2000) found that GATA4 is expressed from early human
fetal testicular development to adulthood. This transcription factor is
evident in Sertoli cells through fetal and postnatal development.
Expression of GATA4 in Sertoli cells peaks at 19 to 22 weeks' gestation,
at the time of high circulating fetal FSH (see 136530). In Leydig cells,
GATA4 is expressed during the fetal period and after puberty, coinciding
with the periods of active androgen synthesis in the testis; this
suggests a link between GATA4 and steroidogenesis. Also, fetal germ
cells and prepubertal spermatogonia express GATA4, and it is
downregulated in these cells after puberty. In androgen resistance,
GATA4 expression in Sertoli and germ cells is weak or totally absent.
GATA4 protein is abundantly present in Sertoli and Leydig cell tumors,
suggesting a relationship to tumorigenesis or tumor progression in
somatic cell-derived testicular neoplasms.

The transcription factors Hnf3a (602294) and Gata4 are the earliest
known to bind the albumin gene enhancer in liver precursor cells in
mouse embryos. To determine how they access sites in silent chromatin,
Cirillo et al. (2002) assembled nucleosome arrays containing albumin
enhancer sequences and compacted them with linker histone. Hnf3a and
Gata4, but not human NF1 (see 600727), mouse Cebp-beta (189965), or
yeast GAL4-AH, bound their sites in compacted chromatin and opened the
local nucleosomal domain in the absence of ATP-dependent enzymes. The
authors showed that the ability of Hnf3a to open chromatin is mediated
by a high-affinity DNA-binding site and by the C-terminal domain of the
protein, which binds histones H3 and H4. They concluded that factors
that potentiate transcription in development are inherently capable of
initiating chromatin opening events.

Durocher et al. (1997) demonstrated that GATA4 and NKX2.5 (600584)
specifically cooperate in activating atrial natriuretic factor (ANF;
108780) and other cardiac promoters, and physically interact both in
vitro and in vivo. Garg et al. (2003) found that GATA4 interacts with
TBX5 (601620) and raised the possibility that GATA4, NKX2.5, and TBX5
function in a complex to regulate a subset of genes required for cardiac
septal formation.

Using rodent and cell culture models, Heineke et al. (2007) showed that
Gata4 has a role in cardiac angiogenesis. Enhanced Gata4 activity
increased myocardial capillary and small conducting vessel densities,
coronary muscle perfusion reserve, and perfusion-dependent cardiac
contractility. Gata4 also promoted pressure overload-induced
angiogenesis. Gata4 upregulated expression of the angiogenic factor Vegf
(192240) by directly binding the Vegf promoter and enhancing
transcription. Pressure overload-induced dysfunction in Gata4-deleted
hearts was partially rescued by overexpression of Vegf and
angiopoietin-1 (ANGPT1; 601667).

Takeuchi and Bruneau (2009) defined the minimal requirements for
transdifferentiation of mouse mesoderm to cardiac myocytes. They showed
that 2 cardiac transcription factors, Gata4 and Tbx5, and a
cardiac-specific subunit of BAF chromatin-remodeling complexes, Baf60c
(SMARCD3; 601737), can direct ectopic differentiation of mouse mesoderm
into beating cardiomyocytes, including the normally noncardiogenic
posterior mesoderm and the extraembryonic mesoderm of the amnion. Gata4
and Baf60c initiated ectopic cardiac gene expression. Addition of Tbx5
allowed differentiation into contracting cardiomyocytes and repression
of noncardiac mesodermal genes. Baf60c was essential for the ectopic
cardiogenic activity of Gata4 and Tbx5, partly by permitting binding of
Gata4 to cardiac genes, indicating a novel instructive role for BAF
complexes in tissue-specific regulation. Takeuchi and Bruneau (2009)
concluded that the combined function of these factors establishes a
robust mechanism for controlling cellular differentiation, and may allow
reprogramming of new cardiomyoctyes for regenerative purposes.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Pehlivan et al. (1999) provided evidence that GATA4 may be involved in
the etiology of some congenital heart defects. They performed FISH
analysis using a GATA4 probe on 5 patients with interstitial deletions
of 8p23.1. Hemizygosity for GATA4 was seen in the 4 patients with
congenital heart disease but not in the patient without known cardiac
anomalies. The authors proposed that haploinsufficiency of GATA4 may
contribute to the congenital heart disease observed in some patients
with del(8)(p23.1).

Kennedy et al. (2001) hypothesized that a severe congenital heart defect
in a 16-year-old female was due to disruption of the GATA4 gene by a
duplication at 8p23.1. The father also had the duplication and had a
less severe congenital heart defect, possibly due to the fact that the
duplication was in a mosaic form.

Garg et al. (2003) identified a G296S mutation (600576.0001) in GATA4
affecting all 16 individuals in 5 generations of a family with
congenital heart defects. All affected individuals had atrial septal
defects (607941), and 8 had additional forms of congenital heart
defects, including ventricular septal defects (VSD), atrioventricular
septal defects (AVSD), pulmonary valve thickening, or insufficiency of
the cardiac valves. None had cardiac conduction or other organ defects.
In a second 4-generation pedigree with autosomal dominant transmission,
Garg et al. (2003) identified a frameshift at codon 359 (E359del;
600576.0002). Similar to the first family, neither the cardiac
conduction system nor other organs were affected in this family. The
G296S mutation affects a residue highly conserved across species and
lies adjacent to the nuclear localization signal (NLS) at the
carboxy-terminal zinc finger, whereas the E359del mutation results in
truncation of the last 40 amino acids or possibly nonsense-mediated
decay. In an overexpression system, the G296S mutation displayed less
transcriptional activation of the alpha-myosin heavy chain (160710) and
atrial natriuretic factor (ANF; 108780) enhancers compared to wildtype,
suggesting mildly reduced activity. This mutation resulted in diminished
DNA-binding affinity and transcriptional activity of GATA4. Furthermore,
the G296S mutation abrogated a physical interaction between GATA4 and
TBX5 (601620), a T-box protein responsible for a subset of syndromic
cardiac septal defects. Conversely, interaction of GATA4 and TBX5 was
disrupted by specific human TBX5 missense mutations that cause similar
cardiac septal defects.

Tomita-Mitchell et al. (2007) identified 4 missense sequence variants in
the GATA4 gene (see, e.g., 600576.0004; 600576.0005) in 5 of 628
patients with cardiac septal or conotruncal defects. One patient had
tetralogy of Fallot (187500). The findings indicated that GATA4
mutations are uncommon in patients with septal defects.

Rajagopal et al. (2007) analyzed the GATA4 gene in 107 patients with
congenital heart defects in the spectrum of Gata4-mutant mice and
identified heterozygous missense mutations in 4 patients, including 1
(12.5%) of 8 patients with ASD (G296C; 600576.0006), 2 (4.8%) of 43
patients with endocardial cushion defect (AVSD4, 614430; 600576.0007 and
600576.0008), and 1 (11.1%) of 9 patients with right ventricular
hypoplasia (see 277200) in the context of doublet inlet left ventricle.
No mutations were found in 48 patients with cardiomyopathy.

Zhang et al. (2008) analyzed the GATA4 gene in 486 Chinese patients with
congenital heart defects and identified 9 heterozygous mutations in 12
patients, including 9 (2.8%) of 319 patients with ventricular septal
defect (VSD1, 614429; see, e.g., 600576.0007 and
600576.0009-600576.0010), 2 (3.1%) of 64 patients with tetralogy of
Fallot (600576.0011; 600576.0012) and 1 (9.1%) of 11 patients with
endocardial cushion defect (600576.0007). None of the patients
manifested a conduction defect.

Peng et al. (2010) screened 135 Chinese pediatric patients with
nonfamilial congenital heart defects for mutations in GATA4 and
identified 2 heterozygous missense mutations, including 1 in a patient
with tetralogy of Fallot (600576.0007) and 1 in a patient with VSD
(600576.0013).

Chen et al. (2010) identified a heterozygous missense mutation in the
GATA4 gene (600576.0016) in affected members of a 3-generation Chinese
family segregating autosomal dominant atrial septal defect and pulmonary
stenosis. Analysis of GATA4 in 30 additional patients with nonsyndromic
congenital heart defects, including 10 with ASD, 10 with VSD, 8 with VSD
combined with ASD, and 2 with AVSD did not reveal any mutations.

In 8 affected members of a Chinese family with secundum ASD, Chen et al.
(2010) identified a heterozygous missense mutation in GATA4
(600576.0017). No GATA4 mutations were found in 70 patients with
sporadic congenital heart defects, including 20 with ASD.

Wang et al. (2011) scanned the GATA4 gene in 210 unrelated Chinese
patients with VSD, 45 of whom had additional cardiac anomalies, and
identified a heterozygous missense mutation (G296R; 600576.0014) in 1
proband (estimated population prevalence of GATA4 mutations, 0.48%). The
authors noted that mutation at GATA4 codon 296 had been previously
identified in patients with VSD and other cardiac anomalies (G296S;
600576.0001) and in a family with ASD and pulmonary stenosis (G296C;
600576.0006), indicating that gly296 is functionally important and a
hotspot for mutation.

Yang et al. (2012) sequenced the coding exons and exon/intron boundaries
of the GATA4 gene in 160 unrelated Han Chinese individuals with VSD, and
identified a heterozygous missense mutation (R43W; 600576.0015) in 1
(0.63%) of the 160 patients that was not found in 200 ethnically matched
controls.

- Somatic Mutations

In diseased cardiac tissues from 2 of 52 explanted hearts of unrelated
patients with complex cardiac malformations, notably ventricular and
atrioventricular septal defects, Reamon-Buettner and Borlak (2006) found
3 nonsynonymous mutations in the HEY2 gene (604674). Since the 2 AVSD
patients also carried binding domain mutations in other cardiac-specific
transcription factors, e.g., NKX2-5 (600584), TBX5 (601620), and GATA4,
Reamon-Buettner and Borlak (2006) concluded that breakdown of
combinatorial interactions of transcription factors may have contributed
to the complexity of their cardiac malformations.

ANIMAL MODEL

Crispino et al. (2001) created mice harboring a single amino acid
replacement in Gata4 that impaired the ability of the protein to
interact with Fog2. These mice died just after embryonic day 12.5 and
exhibited features similar to Fog2-null embryos, most notably absence of
coronary vasculature and reduced staining for Flk1 (191306) and
intracellular adhesion molecule-2 (ICAM2; 146630). However, the Gata4
mutant mice also showed semilunar cardiac valve defects and a
double-outlet right ventricle not seen in Fog2-null mice. Crispino et
al. (2001) concluded that GATA4 function is dependent on interaction
with FOG2 and likely with an additional cardiac-specific FOG protein.

Watt et al. (2004) found that Gata4-null mouse embryos displayed heart
defects characterized by disrupted looping morphogenesis, septation, and
a hypoplastic ventricular myocardium. Myocardial gene expression was
relatively normal, and Gata4 expression in the endocardium was
dispensable for trabeculae formation. The proepicardium was absent in
Gata4-null embryos, blocking formation of the epicardium. Watt et al.
(2004) concluded that the observed myocardial defects may be secondary
to loss of the proepicardium and that GATA4 is essential for generation
of the proepicardium.

Zeisberg et al. (2005) generated mice with conditional deletion of Gata4
at early and late time points in cardiac morphogenesis. Early deletion
resulted in hearts with striking myocardial thinning, absence of
mesenchymal cells within the endocardial cushions, and selective
hypoplasia of the right ventricle. Right ventricular hypoplasia was
associated with downregulation of Hand2 (602407), and cardiomyocyte
proliferation was reduced to a greater extent in the right ventricle
compared to the left. Late deletion of Gata4 resulted in marked
myocardial thinning with decreased cardiomyocyte proliferation, as well
as double-outlet right ventricle. Zeisberg et al. (2005) concluded that
myocardial GATA4 has a general role in regulating cardiomyocyte
proliferation and a specific, stage-dependent role in regulating the
morphogenesis of the right ventricle and the atrioventricular canal.

Mice heterozygous for either a Gata4 or Gata6 (601656) null allele are
normal; however, Xin et al. (2006) found that compound heterozygosity of
Gata4 and Gata6 null alleles resulted in embryonic lethality by day
13.5, accompanied by a spectrum of cardiovascular defects. They
concluded that the cardiovascular system is exquisitely sensitive to
levels of GATA4 and GATA6 and suggested that these GATA factors act
cooperatively in cardiovascular development.

Rajagopal et al. (2007) studied mice heterozygous for a Gata4 mutation
that results in a 50% reduction of Gata4 protein levels, and observed
atrial and ventricular septal defects, endocardial cushion defects
(AVSD), right ventricular hypoplasia, and cardiomyopathy. The authors
noted that genetic background strongly influenced the expression of AVSD
and cardiomyopathy, indicating the presence of important genetic
modifiers.

Qian and Bodmer (2009) utilized a Drosophila heart model involving
mutation of pannier (pnr) to examine the function of GATA4 in adult
heart physiology. Heterozygous pnr mutants had defective cardiac
performance in response to electrical pacing of the heart as well as in
elevated arrhythmias. Adult-specific disruption of pnr function using a
dominant-negative form revealed a cardiac autonomous requirement of pnr
in regulating heart physiology. Neuromancer (nmr), the Drosophila
homolog of TBX20 (606061), was identified as a potential downstream
mediator of pnr in regulating cardiac performance and rhythm regularity.
Qian and Bodmer (2009) concluded that pnr is not only essential for
early cardiac progenitor formation, along with tinman (NKX2-5; 600584)
and T-box factors, but also plays an important role in establishing
and/or maintaining proper heart function, which is partially through
another key regulator, TBX20/nmr.

Using new genetic fate-mapping approaches, Kikuchi et al. (2010)
identified a population of cardiomyocytes in zebrafish that become
activated after resection of the ventricular apex and contribute
prominently to cardiac muscle regeneration. Through the use of a
transgenic reporter strain, Kikuchi et al. (2010) found that
cardiomyocytes throughout the subepicardial ventricular layer trigger
expression of the embryonic cardiogenesis gene gata4 within a week of
trauma, before expression localizes to proliferating cardiomyocytes
surrounding and within the injury site. Cre recombinase-based lineage
tracing of cells expressing gata4 before evident regeneration, or of
cells expressing the contractile gene cmlc2 before injury, each labeled
most cardiac muscle in the ensuing regenerate. By optical voltage
mapping of surface myocardium in whole ventricles, Kikuchi et al. (2010)
found that electrical conduction is reestablished between existing and
regenerated cardiomyocytes between 2 and 4 weeks postinjury. After
injury and prolonged fibroblast growth factor receptor inhibition to
arrest cardiac regeneration and enable scar formation, experimental
release of the signaling block led to gata4 expression and morphologic
improvement of the injured ventricular wall without loss of scar tissue.
Kikuchi et al. (2010) concluded that electrically coupled cardiac muscle
regenerates after resection injury, primarily through activation and
expansion of cardiomyocyte populations.

Huang et al. (2011) demonstrated the direct induction of functional
hepatocyte-like (induced hepatocyte, iHep) cells from mouse tail-tip
fibroblasts by transduction of Gata4, Hnf1-alpha (142410), and Foxa3
(602295) and inactivation of p19(Arf) (600160). iHep cells showed
typical epithelial morphology, expressed hepatic genes, and acquired
hepatocyte functions. Notably, transplanted iHep cells repopulated the
livers of fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase-deficient (Fah-null; see 613871)
mice and rescued almost half of recipients from death by restoring liver
functions.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
ATRIAL SEPTAL DEFECT 2
GATA4, GLY296SER

In a 5-generation pedigree segregating autosomal dominant congenital
heart defects, with all affected individuals manifesting atrial septal
defect (607941), Garg et al. (2003) identified a G-to-A transition at
nucleotide 886 of the GATA4 gene. This resulted in a gly-to-ser
substitution at codon 296 (G296S). Eight of the 16 affected individuals
had other congenital heart defects including ventricular septal defects,
atrioventricular septal defects, pulmonary valve thickening, or
insufficiency of cardiac valves. Neither the cardiac conduction system
nor other organs were affected in this kindred. All affected individuals
carried the mutation. None of the unaffected family members carried the
mutation, nor was it identified in 3,000 unrelated individuals of
diverse ethnicity.

.0002
ATRIAL SEPTAL DEFECT 2
GATA4, 1-BP DEL, 1075G

In a 4-generation pedigree with 8 affected individuals with atrial
septal defect (607941), Garg et al. (2003) identified a frameshift due
to a single-nucleotide deletion associated with glutamic acid at residue
359, which they referred to as E359del. This mutation was identified in
all affected family members and was not seen in any unaffected family
members nor in 300 other control individuals.

In affected members of a 4-generation family with atrial septal defect,
Hirayama-Yamada et al. (2005) identified a deletion (1075delG) in exon 5
of the GATA4 gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature termination
at codon 359. A deceased member of the family, said to have dextrocardia
rather than ASD, was found to have had the same mutation.

.0003
ATRIAL SEPTAL DEFECT 2
GATA4, SER52PHE

In affected members of a family with atrial septal defect (607941),
Hirayama-Yamada et al. (2005) identified a 155C-T transition in exon 1
of the GATA4 gene, predicted to result in a ser52-to-phe (S52F)
substitution in the transcriptional activation domain-1.

In a patient with atrial septal defect (607941), Tomita-Mitchell et al.
(2007) identified a heterozygous 946C-G transversion in exon 4 of the
GATA4 gene, resulting in a gln316-to-glu (Q316E) substitution in the
nuclear localization signal of the protein. The patient also had small
muscular ventricular septal defects and mild pulmonary valve stenosis,
as well as noncardiac anomalies including developmental delay and
hydrocephalus. The mutation was not identified in 159 control
individuals.

ATRIAL SEPTAL DEFECT 2
TETRALOGY OF FALLOT, INCLUDED
GATA4, ASP425ASN

In a patient with atrial septal defect (607941), Tomita-Mitchell et al.
(2007) identified a heterozygous 1273G-A transition in the GATA4 gene,
resulting in an asp425-to-asn (D425N) substitution. The patient's
unaffected mother carried the mutation, suggesting incomplete
penetrance. The mutation was also identified in an unrelated patient
with tetralogy of Fallot (187500), who had a vague family history of
congenital heart defects. The mutation was not identified in 264 control
individuals.

.0006
ATRIAL SEPTAL DEFECT 2
GATA4, GLY296CYS

In a proband with a secundum atrial septal defect (ASD2; 607941) and
pulmonary stenosis, Rajagopal et al. (2007) identified heterozygosity
for an 886G-T transversion in the GATA4 gene, resulting in a
gly296-to-cys (G296C) substitution at a highly conserved residue in the
C-terminal domain. The mutation was not found in 500 control
chromosomes, 246 of which were ethnically matched. The proband's father,
who had persistent left superior vena cava to coronary sinus connection,
was found to carry the mutation. The proband also had a sister with
secundum ASD, but her DNA was unavailable for testing.

VENTRICULAR SEPTAL DEFECT 1, INCLUDED;;
TETRALOGY OF FALLOT, INCLUDED
GATA4, PRO163SER

In a proband with endocardial cushion defect (AVSD4; 614430) consisting
of primum atrial septal defect and cleft mitral valve, Rajagopal et al.
(2007) identified heterozygosity for a 487C-T transition in the GATA4
gene, resulting in a pro163-to-ser (P163S) substitution at a conserved
residue in the TAD2 domain. The proband's father, who also carried the
P163S mutation, was reportedly unaffected. The mutation was not found in
600 control chromosomes, 346 of which were ethnically matched.

cushion defect and a 5-month-old Han Chinese male infant with an
infracristal ventricular septal defect (VSD1; 614429), Zhang et al.
(2008) identified heterozygosity for the GATA4 P163S substitution. The
mutation was not found in 486 ethnically matched controls.

In a pediatric Chinese patient with tetralogy of Fallot (187500), Peng
et al. (2010) identified heterozygosity for the P163S mutation in the
GATA4 gene. The mutation was not found in 114 controls.

of primum atrial septal defect and cleft mitral valve, Rajagopal et al.
(2007) identified heterozygosity for a 1037C-T transition in the GATA4
gene, resulting in an ala346-to-val (A346V) substitution at a relatively
conserved residue in the C-terminal domain. The proband's mother, who
also carried the mutation, was reportedly unaffected. The mutation was
not found in 600 control chromosomes, 346 of which were ethnically
matched.

.0009
VENTRICULAR SEPTAL DEFECT 1
GATA4, GLU359LYS

In a 22-year-old Han Chinese mother and her 10-month-old daughter with
ventricular septal defect (VSD1; 614429), Zhang et al. (2008) identified
heterozygosity for a 1075G-A transition in exon 6 of the GATA4 gene,
resulting in a glu359-to-lys (E359K) substitution at a highly conserved
residue in the C terminus. The mutation was not found in 11 unaffected
family members or in 486 ethnically matched controls. The mother and
daughter each had undergone surgical repair of a paramembranous defect,
measuring 12 mm and 15 mm, respectively, with a left-to-right shunt. The
deceased maternal grandmother also had nonsyndromic VSD.

.0010
VENTRICULAR SEPTAL DEFECT 1
GATA4, ALA442VAL

In 2 unrelated Han Chinese infants, a 3-month-old girl and a 6-month-old
boy, with ventricular septal defect (VSD1; 614429), Zhang et al. (2008)
identified heterozygosity for a 1325C-T transition in exon 7 of the
GATA4 gene, resulting in an ala442-to-val (A442V) substitution at a
highly conserved residue in the C terminus. The mutation was not found
in 486 ethnically matched controls. Both patients had a 12- to 13-mm
paramembranous defect, with a left-to-right shunt.

.0011
TETRALOGY OF FALLOT
GATA4, PRO407GLN

In a 3-month-old Han Chinese male infant with tetralogy of Fallot
(187500), Zhang et al. (2008) identified heterozygosity for a 1220C-A
transversion in the GATA4 gene, resulting in a pro407-to-gln (P407Q)
substitution at a highly conserved residue.

.0012
TETRALOGY OF FALLOT
GATA4, 3-BP INS, 354GCC

In an 11-year-old Han Chinese boy with tetralogy of Fallot (187500),
Zhang et al. (2008) identified heterozygosity for a 3-bp insertion
(354insGCC) in the GATA4 gene, resulting in the insertion of an alanine
residue (118_119insA) in the highly conserved first poly-alanine region.

.0013
VENTRICULAR SEPTAL DEFECT 1
GATA4, PRO407GLN

In a Chinese pediatric patient with ventricular septal defect (VSD1;
614429), Peng et al. (2010) identified heterozygosity for a 1220C-A
transversion in exon 6 of the GATA4 gene, resulting in a pro407-to-gln
(P407Q) substitution in the C-terminal domain. The mutation was not
found in 114 controls.

.0014
VENTRICULAR SEPTAL DEFECT 1
GATA4, GLY296ARG

In a 5-year-old Chinese girl with ventricular septal defect (VSD1;
614429), Wang et al. (2011) identified heterozygosity for a 886G-C
transversion in the GATA4 gene, resulting in a gly296-to-arg (G296R)
substitution at a highly conserved residue. Her affected father and
paternal aunt also carried the mutation; none of the 3 had
atrioventricular conduction defects. Her father had atrial septal defect
(ASD) in addition to VSD, and her deceased paternal grandfather had ASD,
pulmonary stenosis, and atrioventricular block. The mutation was not
found in 200 ethnically matched controls. Transfection studies in COS7
cells with the G296R mutant demonstrated significantly reduced
activation of a direct cardiac downstream target gene, ANP (NPPA;
108780), compared to wildtype GATA4.

.0015
VENTRICULAR SEPTAL DEFECT 1
GATA4, ARG43TRP

In 7 affected members of a 3-generation Han Chinese family with
ventricular septal defect (VSD1; 614429), Yang et al. (2012) identified
heterozygosity for a 127C-T transition in the GATA4 gene, resulting in
an arg43-to-trp (R43W) substitution at a highly conserved residue. All
affected individuals had perimembranous VSD; additional cardiac
structural defects were present in 3 of the mutation-positive patients,
including atrial septal defect (ASD) in the proband's father and
paternal grandfather and patent ductus arteriosus in her paternal aunt.
A deceased paternal great uncle had VSD, ASD, and pulmonary artery
stenosis. The mutation was not found in unaffected family members or in
200 ethnically matched controls. Functional analysis in transfected COS7
cells demonstrated significantly reduced activation of the ANP (NPPA;
108780) promoter with the R43W mutant compared to wildtype GATA4.

atrial septal defect (ASD2; 607941) and pulmonary stenosis, Chen et al.
(2010) identified heterozygosity for an 839C-T transition in exon 4 of
the GATA4 gene, resulting in a thr280-to-met (T280M) substitution at a
highly conserved residue in the C-terminal zinc finger. The mutation was
not found in unaffected family members or in 800 controls.

.0017
ATRIAL SEPTAL DEFECT 2
GATA4, MET310VAL

In 4 affected sisters and 4 affected offspring from a Chinese family
with secundum atrial septal defect (ASD2; 607941), Chen et al. (2010)
identified heterozygosity for a 928A-G transition in exon 5 of the GATA4
gene, resulting in a met310-to-val (M310V) substitution in the conserved
NLS domain. The mutation was also identified in the sisters' unaffected
father, but was not found in other unaffected family members or in 100
controls. Three of the 8 affected individuals also had pulmonary
stenosis.

109560	TITLE *109560 B-CELL LEUKEMIA/LYMPHOMA 3; BCL3
;;BCL4, FORMERLY
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

One of the recurring translocations found in the neoplastic cells of
patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia is t(14;19)(q32;13.1). In 1
such patient, McKeithan et al. (1987) analyzed the leukemic cells with
probes from the immunoglobulin heavy-chain locus. Using a probe for the
IGHA1 gene (146900), they detected a rearranged band by Southern blot
analysis. By analysis of human-mouse somatic cell hybrids, they cloned
the rearranged band and mapped it to chromosome 19. Thus, they confirmed
that the rearranged band contained the translocation breakpoint
junction. (HGM 9.5 revised the symbol from BCL4 to BCL3.) Bhatia et al.
(1991) isolated cDNA clones of mouse bcl-3.

MAPPING

By analysis of a translocation breakpoint and human-mouse somatic cell
hybrid analysis, McKeithan et al. (1987) mapped the BCL3 gene to human
chromosome 19. Bhatia et al. (1991) mapped the Bcl3 gene to the proximal
end of mouse chromosome 7, which is homologous to human chromosome 19.

GENE FUNCTION

Wulczyn et al. (1992) and Franzoso et al. (1992) found that the BCL3
gene encodes an inhibitor (antagonist) for subunit 2 of nuclear factor
kappa-B (NFKB2; 164012).

Activation-induced cell death (AICD) results from rapid proliferation
followed by rapid death of antigen-specific T cells in response to
purified protein antigens. Materials associated with infection, or
adjuvants, attenuate AICD and help maintain the number of responding T
cells. Using microarray analysis of T cells from mice injected with
staphylococcus enterotoxin B (SEB) with or without adjuvants (SEB only,
SEB and lipopolysaccharide and anti-CD40 (see 109535), or SEB and
vaccinia virus), Mitchell et al. (2001) detected increased survival and
markedly increased expression of Bcl3 in cells from animals receiving
antigen together with adjuvant. The authors noted that NFKB factors may
have antiapoptotic activity. Flow cytometric analysis showed that cells
expressing Bcl3 had sustained increased survival approaching that
observed in cells expressing Bcl2 (151430). Mitchell et al. (2001)
concluded that BCL3 can be induced by immunologic adjuvants and that it
confers a survival advantage to T cells both in vivo and in vitro,
possibly by promoting the expression of genes repressed by other NFKB
members, such as REL (164910).

Viatour et al. (2004) found that mammalian Bcl3 was phosphorylated by
Gsk3 (see GSK3A; 606784) leading to degradation of Bcl3 through the
proteasome pathway and that Akt (see AKT1; 164730) activation inhibited
Bcl3 phosphorylation. Phosphorylation regulated BCL3 association with
HDAC1 (601241), HDAC3 (605166), and HDAC6 (300272), and attenuated its
oncogenicity. Viatour et al. (2004) concluded that constitutive BCL3
phosphorylation by GSK3 regulates BCL3 turnover and transcriptional
activity.

Using several human cancer cell lines and Bcl3-null mouse embryo
fibroblasts, Kashatus et al. (2006) determined that BCL3 was inducible
by DNA damage and was required for the induction of HDM2 (MDM2; 164785)
expression and the suppression of persistent p53 (TP53; 191170)
activity. Constitutive expression of BCL3 suppressed DNA damage-induced
p53 activation and inhibited p53-induced apoptosis through a mechanism
that depended in part on HDM2 upregulation.

Carmody et al. (2007) identified BCL3 as an essential negative regulator
of Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling. By blocking ubiquitination of
p50, a member of the NF-kappa-B family (see NFKB1, 164011), Bcl3
stabilizes a p50 complex that inhibits gene transcription. As a
consequence, Bcl3-deficient mice and cells were found to be
hypersensitive to TLR activation and unable to control responses to
lipopolysaccharides. Carmody et al. (2007) concluded that p50
ubiquitination blockade by Bcl3 limits the strength of TLR responses and
maintains innate immune homeostasis.

ANIMAL MODEL

In both Nfkb1 (164011)- and Bcl3-null mice subjected to hindlimb
unloading, Hunter and Kandarian (2004) observed reduced muscle fiber
atrophy and abolition of NF-kappa-B reporter activity compared to
wildtype mice. Hunter and Kandarian (2004) concluded that both the NFKB1
and BCL3 genes are necessary for unloading-induced skeletal muscle
atrophy.

604885	TITLE *604885 MYB-BINDING PROTEIN 1A; MYBBP1A
;;P160
DESCRIPTION The protooncogene MYB (189990) is predominantly expressed in immature
hemopoietic cells where it plays an important role in hemopoietic cell
proliferation and differentiation. Oncogenically activated forms of MYB
are generally N- and/or C-terminal truncations of the normal MYB
protein. Removal of the C terminus of MYB disrupts or deletes a region
termed the negative regulatory domain (NRD), resulting in an increase in
DNA binding, transactivation, and transformation by MYB. One feature of
the NRD is a leucine zipper-like motif. Point mutations that disrupt
this motif also enhance the transactivating and transforming potential
of MYB. Murine Myb-binding protein-1a (Mybbp1a), originally called P160,
was identified by its ability to interact specifically with Myb via this
leucine zipper-like motif (Favier and Gonda, 1994, Tavner et al., 1998).
Thus, it was suggested that Mybbp1a may modulate MYB activity upon
binding to the MYB NRD. Mybbp1a is ubiquitously expressed. By screening
a human genomic library with a mouse Mybbp1a cDNA, Keough et al. (1999)
isolated a portion of the human MYBBP1A gene, which they also called
P160. Using the genomic sequence, they cloned a full-length human
MYBBP1A cDNA. The predicted 1,328-amino acid MYBBP1A contains a central
acidic region, C-terminal basic amino acid repeats, and a number of
potential leucine charged domain motifs throughout the protein. Human
MYBBP1A shares approximately 80% amino acid sequence similarity with
both mouse and rat Mybbp1a. Northern blot analysis detected an
approximately 4.5-kb MYBBP1A transcript in all human cell lines
examined, namely kidney epithelial, erythroleukemic, cervical carcinoma,
and foreskin fibroblast cell lines. Keough et al. (1999) found that
human ESTs corresponding to MYBBP1A are expressed in a wide range of
tissues, suggesting that MYBBP1A is expressed ubiquitously.

By FISH, Keough et al. (1999) mapped the human MYBBP1A gene to 17p13.3.
Using radiation hybrid mapping, they found that the MYBBP1A gene is
closely associated with marker D17S816E, which is located between
markers D17S1828 and D17S938 in 17p13. Tavner et al. (1998) mapped the
mouse Mybbp1a gene to chromosome 11.

605989	TITLE *605989 PROTEIN INHIBITOR OF ACTIVATED STAT4; PIAS4
;;PROTEIN INHIBITOR OF ACTIVATED STAT Y; PIASY
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

STAT proteins (e.g., STAT1; 600555) are latent cytoplasmic transcription
factors that become activated by tyrosine phosphorylation in response to
cytokine stimulation. Using a yeast 2-hybrid method to identify proteins
that interact with STAT1, Liu et al. (1998) identified PIAS1 (protein
inhibitor of activated STAT1; 603566). Using PIAS1 for database searches
and cDNA library screening, they identified other related genes
including PIASX (603567) and PIASY. PIASY encodes a deduced 510-amino
acid protein. Like other members of the PIAS family, the predicted PIASY
protein contains a putative zinc-binding motif and a highly acidic
region.

Using GATA2 (137295) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a placenta
cDNA library, Chun et al. (2003) cloned PIASY. Northern blot analysis of
several mouse tissues detected highest expression in testis. A similar
expression pattern was observed in human tissues. Piasy was expressed in
isolated mouse vascular endothelial cells and more weakly in smooth
muscle cells and fibroblasts. Confocal microscopy detected PIASY in the
nuclear compartment of transfected COS-1 cells, and deletion of its
C-terminal half shifted PIASY to the cytoplasm.

GENE FUNCTION

Sachdev et al. (2001) determined that mammalian Piasy is a potent
repressor of the Wnt (see 164820)-responsive transcription factor Lef1
(153245). Piasy stimulated the sumoylation of Lef1 and multiple other
proteins in vivo and was a SUMO E3 ligase for Lef1 in a reconstituted
system in vitro. Moreover, Piasy bound nuclear matrix-associated DNA
sequences and targeted Lef1 to nuclear bodies. Sachdev et al. (2001)
concluded that Piasy represses Lef1 by subnuclear sequestration.

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Chun et al. (2003) determined that PIASY
interacts with GATA2, a transcription factor involved in hematopoietic
and cardiovascular development. The binding required both the N- and
C-terminal domains of PIASY, but not its central RING domain. PIASY
enhanced the conjugation of SUMO2 (603042) to GATA2 through its E3 SUMO
ligase activity. In a dose-dependent manner, cotransfection of PIASY
suppressed GATA2-dependent ET1 (131240) promoter activity in bovine
carotid endothelial cells. The suppressive effect required the
GATA-binding site in the ET1 promoter and also depended upon the
interaction between PIASY and GATA2. Stimulation of bovine carotid
endothelial cells with VEGF (192240), BFGF (134920), or fetal calf serum
stimulated endogenous Piasy expression. Chun et al. (2003) concluded
that PIASY enhances the conjugation of SUMO2 to GATA2 and that the
interaction of PIASY with GATA2 can modulate GATA-mediated ET1
transcription in endothelial cells through a mechanism that does not
require the RING-like domain.

Bischof et al. (2006) found that overexpression of PIASY caused either
premature senescence or apoptosis, depending on the cellular p53 (TP53;
191170) and RB (RB1; 614041) status. Conversely, the onset of cellular
senescence after a prosenescence stimulus was significantly delayed in a
PIASY-null human lung fibroblast line. The antiproliferative effects of
PIASY relied on its action as a SUMO ligase and were prevented by
papillomavirus E6 oncoprotein. PIASY enhanced sumoylation of p53 and
stimulated its transcriptional activity. In addition, it associated and
cooperated with RB to repress E2F (see E2F1; 189971)-responsive genes.
Bischof et al. (2006) concluded that PIASY resides at a nexus where
cellular senescence or apoptosis is executed.

Galanty et al. (2009) demonstrated that SUMO1 (601912), SUMO2 (603042),
and SUMO3 (602231) accumulate at double-strand DNA break sites in
mammalian cells, with SUMO1 and SUMO2/3 accrual requiring the E3 ligase
enzymes PIAS4 and PIAS1 (603566). Galanty et al. (2009) also established
that PIAS1 and PIAS4 are recruited to damage sites via mechanisms
requiring their SAP domains, and are needed for the productive
association of 53BP1 (605230), BRCA1 (113705), and RNF168 (612688) with
such regions. Furthermore, Galanty et al. (2009) showed that PIAS1 and
PIAS4 promote double-strand break repair and confer ionizing radiation
resistance. Finally, the authors established that PIAS1 and PIAS4 are
required for effective ubiquitin adduct formation mediated by RNF8,
RNF168, and BRCA1 at sites of DNA damage. Galanty et al. (2009)
concluded that their findings identified PIAS1 and PIAS4 as components
of the DNA damage response and revealed how protein recruitment to DNA
double-strand break sites is controlled by coordinated sumoylation and
ubiquitylation.

MAPPING

Scott (2000) mapped the PIASY gene to chromosome 19 based on sequence
similarity between the PIASY sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF077952) and a
chromosome 19 clone (GenBank GENBANK AC016586).

300485	TITLE *300485 BCL6 COREPRESSOR; BCOR
;;KIAA1575
BCOR/CCNB3 FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned BCOR, which they designated
KIAA1575. RT-PCR ELISA detected intermediate BCOR expression in adult
liver, kidney, spinal cord, whole brain, and all specific brain regions
examined, and in fetal liver. Expression was lower in adult heart,
spleen, and ovary, and in fetal brain. Little to no expression was
detected in testis, pancreas, lung, and skeletal muscle.

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen to identify proteins that interact with
the POZ domain of BCL6 (109565), Huynh et al. (2000) cloned BCOR from a
mature B-cell line expression library. The deduced 1,721-amino acid
protein contains 3 C-terminal tandem ankyrin repeats. An alternatively
spliced variant, which they designated BCOR-S, encodes a deduced
1,004-amino acid protein that is identical to the longer variant up to
amino acid 999, after which it has a unique 5-amino acid C terminus.
BCOR-S does not contain the ankyrin repeats. Northern blot analysis
using a probe unique to the longer BCOR variant detected transcripts of
6.5 and 7.0 kb in HeLa cells and the B-cell line, indicating the
presence of a third variant. RNA dot blot analysis detected expression
of BCOR in all tissues examined.

GENE FUNCTION

Huynh et al. (2000) found that the full-length BCOR protein, but not
BCOR-S, functioned as a corepressor when tethered to a promoter DNA
element, and when overexpressed it potentiated BCL6 repression. Both
BCOR variants associated with specific class I and II histone
deacetylases (HDACs), suggesting that BCOR may functionally link these 2
classes of HDACs and that histone/protein deacetylation is a mechanism
for BCOR-mediated repression. BCOR interacted selectively with the POZ
domain of BCL6, but not with 8 other POZ proteins tested, including PLZF
(176797). Interactions between the POZ domain of BCL6 and SMRT (600848),
NCOR (600849), and BCOR were mutually exclusive.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (2000) mapped the BCOR gene
to the X chromosome.

CYTOGENETICS

Pierron et al. (2012) used high-throughput sequencing of cDNAs (RNA-seq)
to investigate samples from individuals diagnosed with small round cell
tumors of bone that lacked the canonical EWSR1/ETS translocation
(133450). A new fusion was observed between BCOR and CCNB3 (300456) on
the X chromosome. RNA-seq results were confirmed by RT-PCR and through
cloning of the tumor-specific genomic translocation breakpoints. In
total, 24 BCOR/CCNB3-positive tumors were identified among a series of
594 sarcoma cases. Gene profiling experiments indicated that
BCOR/CCNB3-positive cases are biologically distinct from other sarcomas,
particularly Ewing sarcoma. Pierron et al. (2012) also showed that CCNB3
immunohistochemistry is a powerful diagnostic marker for this subgroup
of sarcoma and that overexpression of BCOR/CCNB3 or of truncated CCNB3
activates S phase in NIH3T3 cells.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of a family originally reported by Hoefnagel et al.
(1963) and Ogunye et al. (1975) with syndromic microphthalmia-2 (MCOPS2;
300166), Ng et al. (2004) identified a pro85-to-leu mutation in the BCOR
gene (P85L; 300485.0001). Because of phenotypic overlap between the
microphthalmia syndrome in this family and oculofaciocardiodental
syndrome (OFCD; see 300166), they sequenced BCOR in 10 affected females
from 7 OFCD families and found different mutations in each of the 7
families (see 300485.0002-300485.0005), all of which predicted premature
stop codons. BCOR with either the P85L mutation or a mutation found in
OFCD interacted with BCL6 and efficiently repressed transcription,
indicating that these syndromes are likely to result from defects in
alternative functions of BCOR, such as interactions with transcriptional
partners other than BCL6.

Horn et al. (2005) identified deletions in the BCOR gene
(300485.0006-300485.0008) in 3 unrelated patients with OFCD. However,
they did not identify mutations in the BCOR gene in 3 patients with Lenz
microphthalmia syndrome (309800) or in 5 patients with a phenotype
similar to that disorder. The authors concluded that BCOR is the
causative gene for OFCD, but is not the major gene involved in Lenz
microphthalmia syndrome.

ANIMAL MODEL

Ng et al. (2004) cloned the zebrafish ortholog of BCOR and found that
knockdown of the ortholog caused developmental perturbations of the eye,
skeleton, and CNS consistent with the human disorders Lenz
microphthalmia (309800) and OFCD syndrome, confirming that BCOR is a key
transcriptional regulator during early embryogenesis.

606730	TITLE *606730 OXYSTEROL-BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE PROTEIN 1A; OSBPL1A
;;OSBP-RELATED PROTEIN 1; ORP1;;
OSBPL1B
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

OSBPL1A is a member of the OSBP family of intracellular lipid receptors.
For background information on OSBPs, see OSBP2 (606729).

CLONING

By EST database searching for sequences homologous to OSBP (167040),
followed by RT-PCR, Laitinen et al. (1999) identified 6 OSBP-related
proteins, including OSBPL1A, which they called ORP1. Northern blot
analysis revealed expression of a 3.6-kb ORP1 transcript in all tissues
tested, with greatest abundance in brain, heart, skeletal muscle, and
kidney. Endogenous expression in a neuroblastoma cell line was
upregulated by exposure to low density lipoprotein. Similar treatment on
a hepatocellular carcinoma cell line did not result in significant
alterations in ORP1 mRNA levels.

Xu et al. (2001) cloned ORP1 by database searching and multiple rounds
of cDNA library screening. ORP1 encodes a deduced 437-amino acid
protein. Yeast complementation assays indicated that ORP1 is a
counterpart of yeast Kes1. Fluorescence microscopy demonstrated
expression of ORP1 in the cytosol.

Lehto et al. (2001) used RT-PCR analysis with specific primers to
isolate a full-length cDNA encoding a long variant of ORP1. Sequence
analysis predicted that the 950-amino acid protein contains a C-terminal
sterol-binding (SB) domain of approximately 400 residues that includes
the OSBP motif (EQVSHHPP). The N terminus contains 3 ankyrin-like
repeats and a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. This long variant is
referred to as OSBPL1B, and its C terminus is nearly identical to the
437-amino acid variant, OSBPL1A, reported by Xu et al. (2001). OSBPL1B
is most homologous to OSBPL2 (606731), with 85% identity in their SB
domains.

Jaworski et al. (2001) cloned multiple OSBPs, including OSBPL1A and
OSBPL1B. They determined that the OSBPL1A protein does not have a PH
domain. RT-PCR analysis detected ubiquitous expression of OSBPL1B,
whereas expression of OSBPL1A was restricted to retina, brain, pineal
gland, fetal brain, and cultured retinal pigment epithelial cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Binding analysis by Xu et al. (2001) showed strongest binding of ORP1 to
phosphatidic acid, with weaker binding to cardiolipin and
phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate.

GENE STRUCTURE

By database analysis, Lehto et al. (2001) determined that the ORP1 gene
contains 28 exons. Jaworski et al. (2001) determined that the OSBPL1A
variant is encoded by 13 exons, while the OSBPL1B variant is encoded by
28 exons.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Lehto et al. (2001) mapped the OSBPL1A gene to
chromosome 18. Jaworski et al. (2001) refined the localization to
18q11-q12.

180471	TITLE *180471 RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN S11; RPS11
DESCRIPTION See 180466 for general information about ribosomal proteins.

By screening a human fibroblast cDNA library with a rat ribosomal
protein S11 (Rps11) cDNA, Lott and Mackie (1988) isolated a cDNA
encoding human RPS11. The deduced 158-amino acid human RPS11 protein is
identical to the rat Rps11 protein.

Using a PCR product for the analysis of rodent/human somatic cell
hybrids, Feo et al. (1992) mapped the RPS11 gene to 19cen-qter. By
somatic cell hybrid and radiation hybrid mapping analyses, Kenmochi et
al. (1998) mapped the RPS11 gene to 19q13.3 (GenBank GENBANK AB007152).

609828	TITLE *609828 FIBRONECTIN TYPE III AND SPRY DOMAINS-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1; FSD1
;;GLFND
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By EST database analysis and RACE of a fetal brain cDNA library,
Carim-Todd et al. (2001) cloned FSD1. The deduced 496-amino acid protein
has a calculated molecular mass of 55.8 kD. It contains an N-terminal
BBC domain (coiled-coil region downstream of B-box domains), a central
fibronectin (see 135600) type III domain, and a C-terminal SPRY domain.
FSD1 shares 92% amino acid identity with mouse Fsd1 and significant
similarity with its bovine and porcine paralogs. It also shares
significant similarity with FSD1NL (609829). Northern blot analysis of
several human tissues detected abundant expression of a major 1.8- to
2.0-kb transcript and minor 3.0- and 3.5-kb transcripts in brain only.

By screening a human fibrosarcoma cell line expression library to
identify microtubule-associated proteins, Manabe et al. (2002) cloned
FSD1, which they called GLFND. They identified several potential
phosphorylation sites in the protein.

GENE FUNCTION

Manabe et al. (2002) found that endogenous mammalian Fsd1 associated
with microtubules in several cell lines. Human FSD1 associated with a
subpopulation of microtubules that were acetylated, and expression of
FSD1 protected microtubules from depolymerizing agents. FSD1 with an
N-terminal deletion bound microtubules but altered their organization.
FSD1 dissociated from microtubules at the beginning of mitosis and
reassociated with them at cytokinesis. Ectopic expression of FSD1
inhibited cell division and cytokinesis in Chinese hamster ovary cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Carim-Todd et al. (2001) determined that the FSD1 gene contains 13 exons
and spans about 19 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Carim-Todd et al. (2001) mapped the FSD1
gene to chromosome 19. Manabe et al. (2002) mapped the FSD1 gene to
chromosome 19p13.3.

602710	TITLE *602710 AMYLOID BETA A4 PRECURSOR PROTEIN-BINDING, FAMILY B, MEMBER 2; APBB2
;;FE65-LIKE 1; FE65L1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The cytoplasmic domain of the Alzheimer disease locus amyloid protein
precursor (APP; 104760) binds 4 human phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB)
proteins; see APBA1 (602414). By use of a yeast 2-hybrid screening of a
human brain cDNA library, McLoughlin and Miller (1996) identified 3 of
these proteins: the human homolog of Fe65 (APBB1; 602709), an Fe65-like
sequence (APBB2), and an X11-like sequence (APBA2; 602712). From a human
fetal brain cDNA library, Guenette et al. (1996) also cloned APBB2 based
on its interaction with the carboxy terminus of APP. They showed that
the APBB2 protein interacts with another amyloid protein precursor,
APLP2 (104776), but not with APLP1 (104775). The APBB2 gene encodes a
730-amino acid polypeptide that is 51% identical to rat Fe65. Northern
blot analysis revealed that APBB2 has widespread expression in human
tissues.

MAPPING

By use of a radiation hybrid panel, Blanco et al. (1998) mapped the
human APBB2 gene to chromosome 4, between the markers D4S405 (4.6 cR)
and D4S496 (10.1 cR).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Since the APBB2 gene encodes a protein that is capable of binding to
amyloid beta precursor protein (APP), which is central to the
pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease (104300), Li et al. (2005) performed a
genetic association study of APBB2 and late-onset Alzheimer disease
(104310) in 3 independently collected case-control series totaling
approximately 2,000 samples. They found that one SNP (dbSNP rs13133980),
located in a region conserved between the human and mouse genomes,
showed a significant interaction with age of disease onset. For this
marker, Li et al. (2005) reported the association with late-onset
Alzheimer disease was most pronounced in subjects with disease onset
before 75 years of age; odds ratio for homozygotes = 2.43 and for
heterozygotes = 2.15.

613521	TITLE *613521 UROPORPHYRINOGEN DECARBOXYLASE; UROD
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD; EC 4.1.1.37) is a cytosolic enzyme
involved in the biosynthesis of heme. It catalyzes the sequential
removal of 4 of the carboxymethyl side chains of uroporphyrinogen to
yield coproporphyrinogen. Sassa et al. (1983) purified UROD to
homogeneity. A single enzyme is involved in the 4 successive
decarboxylations.

CLONING

Romeo et al. (1986) cloned and sequenced a full-length cDNA coding for
human UROD. The deduced 367-amino acid protein has a molecular mass of
40.8 kD. Northern blot analysis demonstrated the presence of a single
size species of mRNA in erythroid and nonerythroid tissues and in
several cultured cell lines. The level of UROD mRNA was markedly
increased in tissues and cell lines of erythroid origin.

GENE STRUCTURE

Romana et al. (1987) demonstrated that the UROD gene has 10 exons spread
over 3 kb.

MAPPING

De Verneuil et al. (1984) assigned the locus for uroporphyrinogen
decarboxylase to chromosome 1 by somatic cell hybridization and specific
enzyme assay. This was the fourth enzyme of the heme biosynthetic
pathway to be mapped; the other 3 are CPOX (612732) on 9, PBGD (609806)
on 11, and ALAD (125270) on 9. Mattei et al. (1985) used a cDNA clone to
localize UROD to 1p34 by in situ hybridization. McLellan et al. (1985)
arrived at a different location, 1pter-1p21, by somatic cell
hybridization using cell lines with rearranged chromosomes. Using a cDNA
probe in both somatic cell and in situ hybridization, Dubart et al.
(1986) confirmed the assignment to 1p34.

Bahary et al. (1991) assigned the homologous Urod gene to chromosome 4
of the mouse.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Porphyria Cutanea Tarda

In the UROD cDNA from a patient with familial porphyria cutanea tarda
(PCT; 176100), Garey et al. (1989) demonstrated a heterozygous
gly281-to-val substitution (G281V; 613521.0001). The mutation was not
detected in affected persons from 7 other PCT pedigrees with an
autosomal dominant pattern.

- Hepatoerythropoietic Porphyria

In a Tunisian family with hepatoerythropoietic porphyria (HEP; see
176100), de Verneuil et al. (1988) identified homozygosity for a G281E
mutation (613521.0002) in the UROD gene product.

et al. (1989) identified heterozygosity for a gly281-to-val (G281V)
mutation in UROD cDNA.

.0002
PORPHYRIA, HEPATOERYTHROPOIETIC
PORPHYRIA CUTANEA TARDA, INCLUDED
UROD, GLY281GLU

De Verneuil et al. (1986) cloned and sequenced cDNA for the mutated gene
in 1 of their 2 homozygous HEP patients (see 176100) and found that the
glycine residue at position 281 was replaced by glutamic acid (G281E).
This single amino acid change led to a protein that was rapidly degraded
in the presence of cell lysate. Using a synthetic oligonucleotide probe
to screen for the presence of the G281E mutation, de Verneuil et al.
(1988) demonstrated the mutation in HEP-affected members of 2 unrelated
families from Spain, but found that it was absent in 2 other HEP
patients from Italy and Portugal. Moreover, the mutation was not
detected in 13 unrelated cases of familial porphyria cutanea tarda.

Garey et al. (1989) demonstrated this substitution in homozygous state
in a case of HEP.

In a study of 5 Spanish families with hepatoerythropoietic porphyria and
9 unrelated Spanish patients with familial porphyria cutanea tarda,
Roberts et al. (1995) found homozygosity for the G281E mutation in 4
patients with HEP and compound heterozygosity for this mutation in the
fifth. The calculated carrier frequency for G281E in Spain was 1 in
1,800. None of the 9 familial porphyria cutanea tarda patients carried
the G281E mutation. However, one G281E heterozygote in a family with
hepatoerythropoietic porphyria had overt porphyria cutanea tarda. These
findings suggested that the G281E mutation is functionally less severe
than erythrocyte measurements indicate, that its clinical penetrance is
very low in heterozygotes, and that, for this particular mutation,
hepatoerythropoietic porphyria is the homozygous form of familial
porphyria cutanea tarda. The results also indicated that HEP in Spain is
genetically homogeneous, since 9 of the 10 UROD-deficient chromosomes
carried the G281E mutation. In contrast, studies in most of the 14
families reported from outside Spain were likely to have different
mutations. The parents of only 1 of the Spanish cases were
consanguineous, and the other families came from widely different
regions of Spain and did not appear to be related. The mutation probably
entered Spain in the distant past and had become widely distributed. The
G281E mutation was originally described in a Tunisian family (de
Verneuil et al., 1988).

In a Spanish family, Moran-Jimenez et al. (1996) found homozygosity for
the G281E mutation as the cause of HEP. A paternal uncle of the proband
developed clinically overt porphyria cutanea tarda as an adult and
proved to be heterozygous for the G281E mutation.

.0003
PORPHYRIA CUTANEA TARDA
UROD, IVS6DS, G-C, +1

In affected members of 5 of 22 unrelated families segregating PCT
(176100), Garey et al. (1990) found a heterozygous splice site mutation
in the UROD gene (IVS6+1G-C). The mutation resulted in the deletion of
exon 6. The intron/exon junctions on either side of exon 6 fall between
codons; thus, the resulting protein is shorter than the normal protein,
missing only the amino acids coded by exon 6. The shortened protein
lacked catalytic activity, was rapidly degraded when exposed to human
lymphocyte lysates, and was not detectable by Western blot analysis in
lymphocyte lysates derived from affected persons.

.0004
PORPHYRIA, HEPATOERYTHROPOIETIC
UROD, GLU167LYS

Romana et al. (1991) demonstrated that a patient with
hepatoerythropoietic porphyria (176100) was homozygous for a GAG-to-AAG
mutation in the UROD gene that changed glutamic acid-167 to lysine
(E167K).

.0005
PORPHYRIA, HEPATOERYTHROPOIETIC
UROD, ARG292GLY

In 2 Dutch sisters with HEP (see 176100), de Verneuil et al. (1992)
demonstrated compound heterozygosity for a deletion inherited from the
father and an R292G mutation inherited from the mother.

.0006
PORPHYRIA, HEPATOERYTHROPOIETIC
UROD, PRO62LEU

In affected members of a Portuguese family segregating
hepatoerythropoietic porphyria (see 176100), Moran-Jimenez et al. (1996)
demonstrated homozygosity for a pro61-to-leu (P62L) substitution in
UROD. Mutant cDNA corresponding to the P62L change was created by
site-directed mutagenesis. The recombinant protein proved to have
subnormal enzyme activity.

.0007
PORPHYRIA, HEPATOERYTHROPOIETIC
UROD, TYR311CYS

In an Italian family, Moran-Jimenez et al. (1996) identified a
tyr311-to-cys (Y311C) substitution in homoallelic state in the UROD gene
as the cause of HEP (see 176100). Mutant cDNA corresponding to the Y311C
change was created by site-directed mutagenesis. The recombinant protein
proved to have subnormal enzyme activity and was thermolabile.

.0008
PORPHYRIA CUTANEA TARDA
UROD, GLU314GLU

In their family 1 with porphyria cutanea tarda (176100), Mendez et al.
(1998) found that the proband had a heterozygous G-to-A transition in
the last base of exon 9 of the UROD gene causing a GAG (glu) to GAA
(glu) change at codon 314; the amino acid sequence was not altered.
However, the splicing of intron 9 was defective; the entire 67-bp exon 9
was deleted and exon 8 was joined directly to exon 10.

.0009
PORPHYRIA CUTANEA TARDA
UROD, MET165ARG

605475	TITLE *605475 BAI1-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 2; BAIAP2
;;INSULIN RECEPTOR SUBSTRATE p53; IRSP53
DESCRIPTION Brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor-1 (BAI1; 602682) is a secretin
receptor family member whose expression is induced by p53 (191170). Yeh
et al. (1996) cloned a hamster cDNA encoding a 53-kD BAI-associated
protein which, when expressed in mammalian cells, is tyrosine
phosphorylated by the insulin receptor. They termed the protein IRSp53
for insulin receptor substrate p53. The protein contains 521 amino acids
with a calculated molecular mass of 57 kD and is highly expressed in the
brain. The protein appears to be localized primarily in the particulate
fraction of cell lysates. The IRSp53 cDNA was found to encode an
additional protein product of 58 kD (p58) in vivo.

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen with cytoplasmic BAI1 as bait, followed by
screening of a human fetal brain cDNA library, Oda et al. (1999)
isolated a cDNA encoding BAIAP2 and a splice variant. Sequence analysis
predicted that the 520- and 521-amino acid proteins are homologous to
hamster IRSp53 with identity conserved in the C-terminal SH3 domain.
Northern blot analysis revealed expression of a 3.2-kb transcript
primarily in brain with very low levels in placenta, prostate, and
testis as well as ubiquitous expression of a 2.2-kb transcript that is
relatively abundant in liver, prostate, testis, and placenta. The
expression of the 3.2-kb transcript overlaps that of BAI1 in brain
subregions, is similar to that of neuron- and neuroendocrine-restricted
NSE (ENO2; 131360), but different from that of astrocyte-specific GFAP
(137780). Yeast 2-hybrid and GST pull-down analyses with mutated
proteins confirmed that the SH3 domain of BAIAP2 interacts with the
proline-rich cytoplasmic portion of BAI1. Double immunofluorescence
microscopy demonstrated colocalization of BAI1 and BAIAP2 in the
cytoplasmic membrane, whereas cells expressing BAIAP2 alone showed
diffuse staining of the cytosol and nucleus.

Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA; 125370) is an autosomal
dominant, progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by
selective neuron death in the dentatorubral and pallidoluysian pathways
and is associated with CAG repeats in the DRPLA gene (607462). Using a
yeast 2-hybrid screen of a human fetal brain cDNA library with
N-terminus-deleted DRPLA as bait, Okamura-Oho et al. (1999) identified
cDNAs encoding human IRSP53. Sequence analysis identified deduced
proteins of 552 and 521 amino acids. The latter sequence is 94%
identical to hamster IRSp53. Northern blot analysis revealed expression
of a 3.0-kb transcript in most tissues examined and a 3.8-kb transcript
mainly in brain, suggesting alternative splicing. After stimulation of
cells with insulin, immunoblot analysis detected a phosphorylated 58-kD
IRSP53 protein which did not enhance binding to DRPLA.
Coimmunoprecipitation analysis and reporter gene assays indicated that
DRPLA and IRSP53 do interact. Confocal microscopy demonstrated
colocalization in perinuclear dots. GST pull-down analysis determined
that the SH3 domain in the C terminus of IRSP53 binds to a proline-rich
region of DRPLA, which may be interfered with by extended polyglutamine
tracts in the form of CAG repeats.

Miki et al. (2000) demonstrated that IRSP53 is the critical linker
between RAC (see 602048) and WAVE2 (605875). Activated RAC binds to the
N terminus of IRSP53, and the C-terminal SH3 domain of IRSP53 binds to
WAVE2 to form a trimolecular complex. From studies of ectopic
expression, Miki et al. (2000) found that IRSP53 is essential for RAC to
induce membrane ruffling, probably because it recruits WAVE2, which
stimulates actin polymerization mediated by the ARP2/3 complex.

By FISH, Oda et al. (1999) mapped the BAIAP2 gene to chromosome 17q25.

607274	TITLE *607274 UBIQUITIN-SPECIFIC PROTEASE 14; USP14
;;tRNA-GUANINE TRANSGLYCOSYLASE, 60-KD SUBUNIT;;
TGT, 60-KD SUBUNIT
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Eukaryotes synthesize queuosine by the irreversible exchange of queuine
for guanine at tRNA position 34, a reaction catalyzed by tRNA-guanine
transglycosylase (TGT). Mammalian TGT appears to be a dimer of 60- and
43-kD subunits. Deshpande et al. (1996) determined that the purified
rabbit 60-kD Tgt subunit, or Usp14, shares significant sequence identity
with human TRE2 (USP6; 604334) and ORF8 (USP8; 603158), particularly in
the conserved cys and his domains. Using the rabbit sequence, they
identified an EST containing human USP14 and cloned the cDNA from a
placenta cDNA library. The deduced human protein contains 494 amino
acids and shares 98% sequence identity with the rabbit protein.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the USP14
gene to chromosome 18 (TMAP SJGC-11272). Wilson et al. (2002) stated
that 2 human neurologic disorders possibly involving alterations of
synaptic function map to 18p near USP14: major affective disorder-1
(MAFD1; 125480) and schizophrenia disorder 8 (SCZD8; 603206).

GENE FUNCTION

Lee et al. (2010) showed that USP14, a proteasome-associated
deubiquitinating enzyme, can inhibit the degradation of
ubiquitin-protein conjugates both in vitro and in vivo and in cells. A
catalytically inactive variant of USP14 has reduced inhibitory activity,
indicating that inhibition is mediated by trimming of the ubiquitin
chain on the substrate. A high-throughput screen identified a selective
small-molecule inhibitor of the deubiquitinating activity of human
USP14. Treatment of cultured cells with this compound enhanced
degradation of several proteasome substrates that have been implicated
in neurodegenerative disease. USP14 inhibition accelerated the
degradation of oxidized proteins and enhanced resistance to oxidative
stress.

ANIMAL MODEL

Mice that are homozygous with respect to the spontaneous mutation ax(J)
in the ataxia (ax) gene develop severe tremors by 2 to 3 weeks of age
followed by hindlimb paralysis and death by 6 to 10 weeks of age. Wilson
et al. (2002) showed that ax encodes Usp14, one of the large family of
cysteine proteases that specifically feed ubiquitin conjugates. Although
Usp14 can cleave a ubiquitin-tagged protein in vitro, it is unable to
process polyubiquitin, which is believed to be associated with the
protein aggregates seen in Parkinson disease, spinocerebellar ataxia
type 1 (SCA1; 164400), and gracile axonal dystrophy (GAD) in mice. The
physiologic substrate of Usp14 may therefore contain a monoubiquitin
side chain, the removal of which would regulate processes such as
protein localization and protein activity. Expression of Usp14 is
altered in homozygous ax(J) mice as a result of the insertion of an
intracisternal A particle (IAP) into intron 5 of Usp14. In contrast to
other neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson disease and SCA1 in
humans and GAD in mice, neither ubiquitin-positive protein aggregates
nor neuronal cell loss was detectable in the CNS of ax(J) mice. Instead,
these mice had defects in synaptic transmission in both the central and
peripheral nervous systems. These results suggested that ubiquitin
proteases are important in regulating synaptic activity in mammals.

603502	TITLE *603502 INTERFERON-RELATED DEVELOPMENTAL REGULATOR 1; IFRD1
;;TETRADECANOYL PHORBOL ACETATE-INDUCED SEQUENCE 7; TIS7;;
TPA-INDUCED SEQUENCE 7;;
PC4
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By differential screening for cDNAs upregulated during nerve growth
factor (NGF; 162030)-induced neural differentiation in rat PC12 cells,
Tirone and Shooter (1989) cloned Pc4. The deduced protein contains 3
highly hydrophobic regions. Northern blot analysis of adult rat tissues
detected expression in skeletal muscle, heart, and spleen, but not in
kidney, liver, and brain. In day-13.5 rat embryonic tissues, expression
was detected in brain, placenta, and amnion.

The rat Pc4 gene, initially isolated as a nerve growth factor-inducible
sequence in PC12 cells, is necessary for muscle differentiation and may
have a role in signal transduction. By searching EST databases with a
rat Pc4 cDNA, Buanne et al. (1998) isolated ESTs encoding IFDR1, a human
homolog of rat Pc4. The deduced 453-amino acid human IFRD1 protein is
90% identical to both rat and mouse Ifrd1 (Pc4), and 47.6% identical to
human SKMc15 (IFRD2; 602725). The C terminus of IFRD1 shows 47.5%
similarity to the entire human interferon-gamma (IFNG; 147570) protein.
IFRD1 has a calculated molecular mass of 50,685 Da. Northern blot
analysis detected a 2.2-kb IFRD1 transcript in several human tissues,
although at different levels of expression. At midgestation during mouse
development, Ifrd1 was expressed primarily in specific differentiating
structures and body organs.

GENE FUNCTION

By RT-PCR-based differential display, Vietor et al. (2002) identified
Tis7 as a gene upregulated upon Jun (165160)-induced loss of polarity in
a mouse mammary epithelial cell line. In unpolarized cells, the level of
Tis7 protein was elevated and Tis7 translocated into the nucleus. cDNA
microarray analysis revealed that overexpression of Tis7 repressed
several genes. By yeast 2-hybrid and coimmunoprecipitation analyses,
Vietor et al. (2002) determined that Tis7 interacts with several
proteins of the SIN3 complex, including Sin3b (607777), Hdac1 (601241),
Ncor (600849), and Sap30 (603378). The coprecipitated complex was
enzymatically active and repressed transcription of a reporter gene.

GENE STRUCTURE

Brkanac et al. (2009) stated that the IFRD1 gene comprises 12 exons.

MAPPING

Based on STSs, Buanne et al. (1998) tentatively mapped the IFRD1 gene to
7q22-q31.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

To identify genetic modifiers of lung disease severity in cystic
fibrosis (219700), Gu et al. (2009) performed a genomewide
single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) scan in 1 cohort of cystic fibrosis
patients, replicating top candidates in an independent cohort. This
approach identified IFRD1 as a modifier of cystic fibrosis lung disease
severity. IFRD1 is a histone deacetylase-dependent transcriptional
coregulator expressed during terminal neutrophil differentiation.
Neutrophils, but not macrophages, from Ifrd1-null mice showed blunted
effector function, associated with decreased NF-kappa-B p65 (RELA;
164014) transactivation. In vivo, IFRD1 deficiency caused delayed
bacterial clearance from the airway, but also less inflammation and
disease--a phenotype primarily dependent on hematopoietic cell
expression, or lack of expression, of IFRD1. In humans, IFRD1
polymorphisms were significantly associated with variation in neutrophil
effector function. The IFRD SNP dbSNP rs7817 showed significant
association with both cross-sectional or longitudinal measures of lung
function with a P value of less than 0.05 after Bonferroni correction.
Notably, both family-based association and quantitative transmission
disequilibrium tests showed that the heterozygote genotype CT was
associated with lower lung function than either homozygote CC or TT.

Brkanac et al. (2009) identified a missense mutation in the IFRD1 gene,
a A-to-G transition at nucleotide 743 that resulting in an ile-to-val
substitution at codon 172 (I172V), that segregated absolutely with the
SMNA (607458) phenotype in a 6-generation American family of Irish
descent. Isoleucine-172 is highly conserved across species, but valine
at this position is present in elephant, chicken, Xenopus tropicalis,
and zebrafish. Brkanac et al. (2009) suggested that this change might
affect protein structure. However, they concluded that mutation analysis
of IFRD1 in additional patients with similar phenotypes was needed for
demonstration of causality and further evaluation of the importance of
IRFD1 in neurologic diseases.

ANIMAL MODEL

Vadivelu et al. (2004) found that Tis7 knockout mice were fertile and
showed no gross histologic abnormalities. However, Tis7 disruption
delayed skeletal muscle regeneration and altered skeletal muscle
isometric contractile properties after muscle crush damage, and it
downregulated expression of several muscle-specific genes. Cultured
primary myogenic satellite cells from Tis7 -/- mice showed reduced
differentiation potential and fusion index. Vadivelu et al. (2004)
concluded that TIS7 plays a regulatory role during adult muscle
regeneration.

606403	TITLE *606403 CALCIUM CHANNEL, VOLTAGE-DEPENDENT, GAMMA-3 SUBUNIT; CACNG3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Voltage-dependent calcium channels couple membrane depolarization in a
number of cellular processes. These activities are regulated by distinct
channels composed of alpha-1 (e.g., CACNA1D; 114206), beta (e.g.,
CACNB1; 114207), alpha-2/delta (e.g., CACNA2D1; 114204), and gamma
(e.g., CACNG1; 114209) subunits.

CLONING

By searching an EST database for sequences homologous to CACNG2
(602911), followed by PCR of a cerebellum cDNA library, Black and Lennon
(1999) identified a cDNA encoding CACNG3. The deduced 315-amino acid
transmembrane protein is 98% identical to CACGN2, but only 17% identical
to CACNG1.

By targeted genomic screening for sequences similar to CACNG1 and mouse
Cacng2, Burgess et al. (1999) cloned CACNG3, CACNG4 (606404), and CACNG5
(606405). By RT-PCR analysis of 24 adult and fetal tissues, Burgess et
al. (2001) detected expression of CACNG3 only in adult and fetal brain.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Black and Lennon (1999) and Burgess et al.
(1999) determined that the CACNG3 gene contains 4 exons with a large
first intron.

MAPPING

By electronic PCR and genomic sequence analysis, respectively, Black and
Lennon (1999) and Burgess et al. (1999) mapped the CACNG3 gene to
16p13.1-p12, a region associated with familial infantile convulsive
disorder (602066).

610571	TITLE *610571 FK506-BINDING PROTEIN 11; FKBP11
;;FK506-BINDING PROTEIN, 19-KD; FKBP19
DESCRIPTION For background information on FK506-binding proteins (FKBPs), see FKBP1A
(186945).

CLONING

By searching databases for putative FKBPs, Rulten et al. (2006) obtained
a full-length cDNA encoding FKBP11, which they called FKBP19. The
deduced 201-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 22 kD.
It has an N-terminal signal sequence, followed by a peptidyl-prolyl
isomerase domain, a transmembrane region, and a lysine-rich C-terminal
tail containing a variant of the dilysine motif found in endoplasmic
reticulum membrane proteins. Northern blot analysis detected high
expression of an 800-bp transcript in pancreas, with low levels in all
other tissues examined. RNA dot blot analysis revealed ubiquitous FKBP11
expression, with highest levels in pancreas and other secretory tissues,
such as stomach, pituitary, salivary gland, and lymph node.

GENE FUNCTION

Using an in vitro binding assay, Rulten et al. (2006) showed that FKBP11
bound FK506 weakly.

GENE STRUCTURE

Patterson et al. (2002) determined that the FKBP11 gene has 6 coding
exons. Rulten et al. (2006) identified 5 NKX2-5 (NKX2E; 600584)-binding
sites and 4 PAX4 (167413)-binding sites upstream of the FKBP11 coding
region.

MAPPING

Rulten et al. (2006) stated that the FKBP11 gene maps to chromosome
12q13.

607782	TITLE *607782 LUC7, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; LUC7L
;;LUC7-LIKE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The LUC7L gene may represent a mammalian heterochromatic gene, encoding
a putative RNA-binding protein similar to the yeast Luc7p subunit of the
U1 snRNP splicing complex that is normally required for 5-prime splice
site selection (Tufarelli et al., 2001).

CLONING

Using several techniques, Tufarelli et al. (2001) cloned LUC7L using
total RNA from an erythroleukemia cell line. They identified several
alternatively spliced variants. The longest deduced protein contains 371
amino acids and is homologous to the S. cerevisiae Luc7 protein. LUC7L
has an N-terminal conserved region followed by a C3H zinc finger, a
coiled-coil domain, a C2H2 RNA-binding zinc finger, 2 overlapping
bipartite nuclear localization signals, and a C-terminal RS/RE
(arginine-serine-rich and arginine-glutamate-rich) motif. Northern blot
analysis revealed 2 predominant transcripts of about 3.5 and 2.5 kb in
all tissues examined. Several additional transcripts of 1.4 to 1.6 kb
were detected. The relative expression of the splicing isoforms varied
within and between tissues.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Tufarelli et al. (2001) determined that
the LUC7L gene contains at least 12 exons and spans about 40.5 kb. The
LUC7L gene is associated with a CpG island.

GENE FUNCTION

Inherited human genetic disorders are usually caused by mutations that
disrupt the coding sequences of the gene or its conserved, local
cis-acting sequences, including promoters or mRNA processing signals.
Much less frequently, gene expression is downregulated by inherited
deletions of remote regulatory elements which can be located as much as
100 kb upstream or downstream of the genes that they control (Kleinjan
and van Heyningen, 1998). Tufarelli et al. (2003) described a novel
mechanism of human genetic disease. In a case of alpha-thalassemia, they
found that a unique deletion (141850.0057) removed the HBA1 gene
(141800) and the HBQ1 gene (142240) and juxtaposed a region that
normally lies approximately 18 kb downstream of the human alpha-globin
cluster next to the structurally normal adult alpha-2-globin (HBA2;
141850) gene. Deletion in this patient with alpha(-)-thalassemia,
designated ZF, did not remove any positive cis-acting sequences (Barbour
et al., 2000), but expression of the structurally intact alpha-globin
gene was stably silenced and, during development, its CpG island was
densely methylated and insensitive to endonucleases over a region of
approximately 2 kb. These epigenetic changes were not associated with
any alterations in the timing of replication or nuclear
compartmentalization of the abnormal allele. Other CpG islands
associated with genes flanking the alpha-globin cluster were unaffected
by the deletion. Tufarelli et al. (2003) showed that in the affected
individual, in a transgenic model, and in differentiating embryonic stem
cells, transcription of antisense RNA mediated silencing and methylation
of the associated CpG island. The LUC7L gene is transcribed from the
opposite strand to the alpha-globin genes. Antisense RNA transcripts had
been implicated in the silencing and methylation of CpG islands
associated with some maternally imprinted genes and with Xist (314670),
which is involved in X-chromosome inactivation.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Tufarelli et al. (2001) mapped the LUC7L
gene to the centromeric side of the alpha-globin cluster (see 141800) on
chromosome 16p13.3. LUC7L is transcribed toward the telomere in the
opposite orientation to the alpha-globin genes. By interspecific hybrid
analysis and genomic sequence analysis, they mapped the mouse Luc7l gene
to chromosome 17, separated from the mouse alpha-globin cluster on
chromosome 11.

179505	TITLE *179505 RAS HOMOLOG GENE FAMILY, MEMBER G; RHOG
;;RAS HOMOLOG GENE G;;
ARHG
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ARHG is a member of the RAS superfamily of genes, which encode
GTP-binding proteins that act in the pathway of signal transduction and
play a key role in the regulation of cellular functions.

CLONING

Vincent et al. (1992) isolated a new member of the RAS homolog gene
family, ARHG, from hamster and human. The ARHG gene is a late induced
gene, and RNA accumulation is proportional to the strength of the
mitogen used. Phylogenetic studies suggested that it may have diverged
early during evolution.

GENE FUNCTION

Katoh and Negishi (2003) demonstrated that RHO G interacts directly with
ELMO2 (606421) in a GTP-dependent manner and forms a ternary complex
with DOCK180 (601403) to induce activation of RAC1 (602048). The RHO
G-ELMO2-DOCK180 pathway is required for activation of RAC1 and cell
spreading mediated by integrin, as well as for neurite outgrowth induced
by nerve growth factor. Katoh and Negishi (2003) concluded that RHO G
activates RAC1 through ELMO and DOCK180 to control cell morphology.

GENE STRUCTURE

Le Gallic and Fort (1997) determined that the ARHG gene spans 25 kb and
contains only 2 exons with an intervening 20-kb intron. The first exon
is noncoding and 85% GC-rich. The ARHG gene lacks TATA and CAAT boxes,
typical of housekeeping genes.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization on human metaphase chromosomes,
Taviaux et al. (1993) assigned the RHOG gene to 11p15.5-p.15.4. Precise
observations indicated it was located distal to WEE1 (193525).

605123	TITLE *605123 SERINE PROTEASE INHIBITOR, KUNITZ-TYPE, 1; SPINT1
;;HEPATOCYTE GROWTH FACTOR ACTIVATOR INHIBITOR; HAI
DESCRIPTION In response to tissue damage such as hepatic and renal injury,
hepatocyte growth factor (HGF; 142409), an inactive single-chain
precursor protein, is converted by HGF activator (HGFAC; 604552) by
limited proteolysis into an active heterodimeric molecule. HGFAC is also
produced as a precursor protein that is activated by limited proteolysis
and neutralized by specific inhibitors. Shimomura et al. (1997) purified
SPINT1, an inhibitor of HGFAC, from a conditioned medium of a stomach
carcinoma cell line. They molecularly cloned the cDNA of SPINT1, which
encodes a deduced 478-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular
mass of 53.3 kD. The protein contains an N-terminal putative signal
peptide sequence, a hydrophobic, membrane-associated C-terminal region,
and a central region that encodes the processed, cleaved protein. SPINT1
has 3 potential N-glycosylation sites. Two regions show extensive
similarity to the Kunitz-type sequence of serine protease inhibitors,
but only one of these regions is believed to be responsible for the
inhibitory activity of SPINT1. Between the 2 Kunitz domains is a region
similar to the cysteine-rich ligand-binding domain of the low density
lipoprotein receptor (LDLR; 606945). Shimomura et al. (1997) showed that
the inhibitory activity of SPINT1 is specific for HGF activator in the
HGF-converting process. SPINT1 is produced as an active
membrane-associated protein and is proteolytically cleaved and secreted.
By Northern blot analysis, Shimomura et al. (1997) demonstrated that
SPINT1 is expressed as a 2.5-kb transcript in various tissues, with high
expression in adult placenta, kidney, pancreas, prostate, small
intestine, fetal kidney, and fetal lung, and low expression in liver and
adult lung.

Lin et al. (1999) purified the serine protease ST14 (606797) in a
complex with SPINT1. By Northern and Western blot analysis of normal
breast and breast cancer cell lines, Oberst et al. (2001) found complete
concordance in expression of ST14 and SPINT1; the expression correlated
with expression of epithelial cell markers.

604982	TITLE *604982 HPS1 GENE; HPS1
;;PALE EAR, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Oh et al. (1996) identified the HPS1 gene by positional cloning. The
HPS1 gene encodes a novel transmembrane protein that is thought to be a
component of multiple cytoplasmic organelles and is apparently crucial
for their normal development and function.

Wildenberg et al. (1998) demonstrated an apparent alternative transcript
of the HPS1 gene. By RT-PCR and Northern blot analysis, 2 polyadenylated
transcripts were found in normal human melanocytes, human bone marrow
cells, human melanoma cells, lymphoblastoid cell lines, and
megakaryocytic leukemia cells. Thus, the HPS1 gene is complex and may
have more than 1 biologically active transcript. Wildenberg et al.
(1998) noted that the same type of alternative splicing occurs in the
IGHM gene (147020), resulting in membrane-bound and secreted protein
products.

GENE FUNCTION

Martina et al. (2003) determined that HPS1 and HPS4 (606682) form a
lysosomal complex that they termed BLOC3 (biogenesis of lysosome-related
organelles complex-3). Coimmunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated
that epitope-tagged and endogenous HPS1 and HPS4 proteins assembled with
each other in vivo. The complex was predominantly cytosolic, with a
small amount peripherally associated with membranes. Size exclusion
chromatography and sedimentation velocity analysis of the cytosolic
fraction indicated that HPS1 and HPS4 formed a moderately asymmetric
complex with a molecular mass of about 175 kD. Hps4-deficient
fibroblasts from light ear mice displayed normal distribution and
trafficking of a lysosomal protein and an apparently normal accumulation
of Zn(2+) in intracellular vesicles. In contrast, fibroblasts of AP3
(see AP3B1; 603401)-deficient pearl mice showed deficits in both of
these measures. Martina et al. (2003) concluded that HPS1 and HPS4 are
components of a cytosolic complex that is involved in the biogenesis of
lysosomal-related organelles through a mechanism distinct from that
operated by the AP3 complex.

MAPPING

Fukai et al. (1995) used the linkage disequilibrium mapping approach to
localize the HPS1 locus in 2 groups in whom the Hermansky-Pudlak
syndrome (203300) is particularly frequent: a group in Puerto Rico and a
group in an isolated village in the Swiss Alps. They localized the HPS1
locus in both groups to a 0.6-cM interval in chromosome segment
10q23.1-q23.2. Wildenberg et al. (1995) likewise mapped the HPS1 locus
to 10q. They collected blood samples from a relatively homogeneous
population in Puerto Rico, where Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome has a
frequency of about 1 in 1,800, giving a carrier frequency estimated to
be 1 in 21. Analysis of pooled DNA samples allowed them to screen the
genome rapidly for candidate loci and identify linkage with a marker on
10q. The result was verified with additional markers, and a maximum lod
score of 5.07 at theta = 0.001 was calculated for marker D10S198.
Haplotype analysis placed the HPS1 locus in a region of approximately 1
cM that contains the markers D10S198 and D10S1239.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Oh et al. (1996) identified homozygous frameshifts in the HPS1 gene in
Puerto Rican, Swiss, Irish, and Japanese HPS patients.

Oh et al. (1998) performed mutation analysis on 44 unrelated Puerto
Rican and 24 unrelated non-Puerto Rican HPS patients. A 16-bp frameshift
duplication (604982.0001), the result of an apparent founder effect, was
nearly ubiquitous among Puerto Rican patients. A frameshift at codon 322
may be the most frequent HPS mutation in Europeans. The mutation in
these cases was a 1-bp insertion (or duplication) in a poly(C) tract at
codons 322 to 324. Oh et al. (1998) also described 6 novel HPS1
mutations: a 5-prime splice-junction mutation of IVS5, 3 frameshifts, a
nonsense mutation, and a 1-codon in-frame deletion. These mutations
defined an apparent frameshift hotspot at codons 321-322. Overall,
however, they detected mutations in the HPS1 gene in only about half of
non-Puerto Rican patients, and presented evidence suggesting locus
heterogeneity for HPS.

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

The different clinical HPS phenotypes associated with different HPS1
frameshifts suggested to Oh et al. (1996) that differentially truncated
HPS1 polypeptides may have somewhat different consequences for
subcellular function.

ANIMAL MODEL

Two genetically distinct mouse loci, 'pale ear' (ep) and 'ruby-eye'
(ru), both with mutant phenotypes similar to human Hermansky-Pudlak
syndrome, map close together in the homologous region of murine
chromosome 19, which suggested that one of these loci might be
homologous to human HPS. Feng et al. (1997) characterized the mouse Hps
cDNA and genomic locus, and identified pathologic Hps gene mutations in
ep but not in ru mice, establishing mouse 'pale ear' as an animal model
for human Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome. The phenotype of homozygous ep
mutant mice encompasses those of both Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome and
Chediak-Higashi syndrome, suggesting that these disorders may be closely
related. In addition, the mouse and human HPS genes both contain a rare
'AT-AC' intron (i.e., an intron with nonconsensus splice sites), and
comparison of the sequences of this intron in the mouse and human genes
identified conserved sequences that suggest a possible role for pre-mRNA
secondary structure in excision of this rare class of introns. (See
601428 and 601429 for a discussion of small nuclear RNAs necessary for
AT-AC intron splicing, and see Hall and Padgett (1994) for a discussion
of introns with nonconsensus splice sites.)

To test for in vivo interactions between the HPS1 and HPS2 genes in the
production and function of intracellular organelles, Feng et al. (2002)
created mice doubly heterozygous for the 2 mutant genes by appropriate
breeding. Cooperation between the 2 genes in melanosome production was
evident in increased hypopigmentation of the coat together with dramatic
quantitative and qualitative alterations of melanosomes of the retinal
pigment epithelium and choroid of double-mutant mice. Lysosomal and
platelet dense granule abnormalities, including hyposecretion of
lysosomal enzymes from kidneys and depression of serotonin
concentrations of platelet dense granules were likewise more severe in
double than in single mutants. Also, lysosomal enzyme concentrations
were significantly increased in lungs of double-mutant mice. Interaction
between the 2 genes was specific in that effects on organelles were
confined to melanosomes, lysosomes, and platelet dense granules.
Together, the evidence indicated that these 2 HPS genes function largely
independently at the whole-organism level to affect the production and
function of all 3 organelles. Furthermore, the increased lysosomal
enzyme levels in lung of double-mutant mice suggested a cause of a major
clinical problem of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome, lung fibrosis.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HERMANSKY-PUDLAK SYNDROME 1
HPS1, 16-BP DUP

By SSCP/heteroduplex analysis and DNA sequencing, Oh et al. (1996) found
that 22 Puerto Rican patients with Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (203300)
were homozygous for a 16-bp duplication within exon 15 of the HPS gene,
resulting in a frameshift distal to codon pro496, with termination of
the nonsense polypeptide at codon 586. Similarly, all 11 obligate
heterozygotes tested were heterozygous, whereas they did not observe
this mutation in 5 Puerto Rican or 15 Asian controls, or in 11
non-Puerto Rican Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome patients. Although
Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome is frequent on the island of Puerto Rico, it
has not been reported elsewhere in the Caribbean. Apparent homogeneity
of the 16-bp frameshift duplication among Puerto Rican Hermansky-Pudlak
syndrome patients suggests that this mutation arose in Puerto Rico
during its early population or colonization and that the frequency of
the mutation was amplified as a founder effect due to occult inbreeding
and genetic drift. The mutation was easily identified, even by simple
agarose electrophoresis of the exon 15 PCR product, which appears
abnormally large; furthermore, heterozygotes additionally exhibit a
prominent aberrant heteroduplex band. Thus, diagnosis, prenatal
diagnosis, and carrier testing for Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome in the
Puerto Rican population, in which the expected frequency of heterozygote
may be as high as 1 in 21 persons, is possible.

All identified patients with Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome in northwest
Puerto Rico were found to be homozygous for the 16-bp duplication in
exon 15 of the HPS gene. Gahl et al. (1998) compared the clinical and
laboratory characteristics of these patients with those of patients
without the 16-bp duplication. They studied 49 patients: 27 Puerto
Ricans and 22 patients from mainland United States who were not of
Puerto Rican descent. The diagnosis was based on the presence of
albinism and the absence of platelet dense bodies. Homozygosity for the
16-bp duplication was found in 25 of the 27 Puerto Rican patients,
whereas none of the non-Puerto Rican patients carried this mutation.
Like the patients without the duplication, the patients with the 16-bp
duplication had a broad variation in pigmentation. Nine of 16 adults
with the duplication, but none of the 10 without it, had a diffusing
capacity for carbon monoxide that was less than 80% of the predicted
value. High-resolution computed tomography in all 12 patients with the
16-bp duplication revealed minimal fibrosis in 8, moderate fibrosis in
1, severe fibrosis in 1, and no fibrosis in 2. Computed tomography in 8
patients without the duplication revealed minimal fibrosis in 3 and no
fibrosis in the rest. Inflammatory bowel disease developed in 8 patients
(4 in each group) between 3 and 25 years of age. Thus, the 16-bp
duplication in exon 15 of the HPS gene, which had been found only in
Puerto Rican patients, is associated with a broad range of pigmentation
and an increased risk of restrictive lung disease in adults.

.0002
HERMANSKY-PUDLAK SYNDROME 1
HPS1, 1-BP INS, 322C

In the inbred Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (203300) kindred studied by
Schallreuter et al. (1993), Oh et al. (1996) identified homozygosity for
a frameshift at codon pro324, due to an additional cytosine in a run of
8 cytosines, in the HPS gene. This same mutation (T322insC) was found in
an unrelated Irish-German patient (Oh et al., 1998). The 2 patients were
divergent for intragenic polymorphisms that flank this mutation; the
findings suggested that this frameshift arose independently in the 2
populations. A third patient was homozygous for the frameshift mutation
and for the polymorphic haplotype found in the patient of Irish-German
origin. Patient 4 was a compound heterozygote for the Swiss type
mutation but associated, however, with the Irish-German haplotype; the
other allele in this patient had a novel nonsense mutation, glu666 to
ter (604982.0003).

.0003
HERMANSKY-PUDLAK SYNDROME 1
HPS1, GLU666TER

In a non-Puerto Rican case of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (203300), Oh et
al. (1998) found compound heterozygosity for the T322insC frameshift
mutation (604982.0002) and a novel nonsense mutation, glu666 to ter
(E666X).

.0004
HERMANSKY-PUDLAK SYNDROME 1
HPS1, 1-BP DEL, 322C

Oh et al. (1998) described a Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (203300) patient
who was homozygous for a novel frameshift mutation in the HPS gene,
T322delC, that involved the same poly(C) tract involved in the T322insC
frameshift (604982.0002).

.0005
HERMANSKY-PUDLAK SYNDROME 1
HPS1, GLU133TER

Shotelersuk et al. (1998) studied 18 non-Puerto Rican Hermansky-Pudlak
syndrome (203300) families and identified HPS mutations in 3 of them. In
1 patient, one of the newly identified mutations, E133X, was present in
compound state with a previously described mutation, T322insC
(604982.0002). The patient was a 6-year-old girl of Italian, German, and
Ukrainian ancestry. Born with pale skin, she was noted to have nystagmus
at 2 months of age and pale retinas at 3 months of age, when
oculocutaneous albinism was diagnosed. Bruising began at 7 to 8 months
of age, and Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome was diagnosed at 18 months of age
based on abnormal platelet aggregation studies. Epistaxis occurred in
the winter months and prolonged bleeding accompanied a cut lip and
placement of myringotomy tubes. Asthma was diagnosed at 1 year of age.
There were no signs of colitis or pulmonary fibrosis.

.0006
HERMANSKY-PUDLAK SYNDROME 1
HPS1, 1-BP INS, 962G

Horikawa et al. (2000) reported a Japanese man with Hermansky-Pudlak
syndrome (203300), who had oculocutaneous albinism and a bleeding
diathesis. The patient was a compound heterozygote for 2 HPS1 mutations:
a frameshift mutation (962-963insG) at codon 321 in exon 11; and a
5-prime splice-junction mutation (IVS5+5G-A). The content of eumelanin
in the patient's hairs was significantly reduced. Histologic analysis
using light and electron microscopy revealed that melanocytes in the
patient's epidermis contained giant melanosomes.

300090	TITLE *300090 SIGNAL SEQUENCE RECEPTOR, DELTA; SSR4
;;TRANSLOCON-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN, DELTA SUBUNIT; TRAPD
DESCRIPTION Brenner et al. (1997) described 2 novel genes that are located in the
Xq28 region, are driven by a bidirectional promoter located between
them, and encode proteins involved in unrelated biochemical pathways
located in different compartments of the cell. Translocon-associated
protein (TRAP)-delta subunit is assumed to be involved in the secretion
of proteins. The highest concentration of TRAP-delta transcripts was
observed in pancreas, where large quantities of lipases, nucleases, and
proteases are synthesized and secreted. The second gene, IDH3G (300089),
encodes the gamma subunit of the NAD(+)-dependent isocitrate
dehydrogenase, which is involved in the energy metabolism of the cell.
Correspondingly, the highest expression levels are in tissues with
increased energy turnover, like heart, skeletal muscle, and brain. IDH3G
and TRAP-delta were found to be arranged in a compact head-to-head
manner. The nontranscribed intergenic region represents only 133 bp and
is embedded in a CpG island. Brenner et al. (1997) concluded that the
CpG island functions as a bidirectional promoter to initiate the
transcription of both functionally unrelated genes with quite distinct
expression patterns. The authors showed that in rat and mouse this area
is similarly compact, representing less than 249 bp in rat and not more
than 164 bp in mouse. In both species, this intergenic region is
embedded in a CpG island and is highly conserved, with nucleotide
identity values ranging from 70.1% between human and rat to 92.6%
between mouse and rat.

605141	TITLE *605141 PRE-B-LYMPHOCYTE GENE 1; VPREB1
;;VPREB; IGVPB;;
IMMUNOGLOBULIN IOTA POLYPEPTIDE CHAIN; IGI
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

A gene designated VPREB has been found to be highly conserved in many
mammalian species (Kudo and Melchers, 1987; Bauer et al., 1988). Its
structure, which has been determined in mouse and man, shows regional
homologies to variable regions of heavy and light chains of
immunoglobulin. VPREB in mouse and man, and lambda-5 in mouse, are
expressed in pre-B lymphocytes, but not in mature B cells or in other
blood cell lineages. Neither gene is rearranged during B-cell
development.

MAPPING

In the mouse Vpreb is situated 4.6 kb upstream of another gene, called
lambda-5 (IGLL1; 146770), which shows strong regional homologies to
lambda light-chain genes (Kudo and Melchers, 1987). Both genes are
located on mouse chromosome 16, which also carries the lambda
light-chain genes. By Southern blot analysis of restriction
enzyme-digestive DNAs from a panel of mouse-human somatic cell hybrids,
Bauer et al. (1988) demonstrated that the human equivalent of VPREB is
located in band 22q11.2, distal to BCR2 and proximal to BCR4. The order
of loci on chromosome 22 is centromere--BCR2, IGVPB,
V(lambda-1)--BCR4--C(lambda)--BCR1--BCR3--SIS.

GENE FUNCTION

The VpreB and lambda-5 genes encode the iota and omega polypeptide
chains, respectively (Pillai and Baltimore, 1988), which associate with
the Ig-mu chain to form a molecular complex that is expressed on the
surface of pre-B cells. This complex presumably regulates Ig gene
rearrangements in the early steps of B-cell differentiation. In the
mouse the 2 genes are simultaneously expressed in pre-B cells, are only
4.6 kb apart, and belong to the same transcription unit. A primary
transcript is synthesized from which the pre-B and lambda-5 mRNAs are
derived by alternative splicing. In the human, however, Mattei et al.
(1991) concluded that the 2 genes are separate: the pre-B homolog lies
proximal to the BCR (151410) breakpoint in chronic myeloid leukemia
(CML; 608232) and the lambda-5 homolog lies distal to the breakpoint in
CML.
