DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Neuropeptide FF (NPFF) and the related neuropeptide AF (NPAF) were
originally isolated from bovine brain using an antibody against the
molluscan peptide FMRF-NH2. NPFF has been detected in human serum. In
rat, these FMRF-amide-related peptides have been shown to have
wide-ranging physiologic effects, including the modulation of
morphine-induced analgesia, elevation of arterial blood pressure, and
increased somatostatin secretion from the pancreas. By searching a human
EST database, Perry et al. (1997) identified epididymis ESTs encoding
sequences that are homologous to the bovine FMRF-amide-related peptides.
Using these ESTs to screen a human testis cDNA library, they isolated a
full-length cDNA encoding the precursor of both NPFF and NPAF; the
authors called this precursor the 'FMRF-amide-like peptide precursor,'
or FMRFAL. The deduced 113-amino acid precursor polypeptide contains a
putative hydrophobic leader sequence. Within the precursor, both
FMRF-amide-related peptides are flanked by single or pairs of basic
amino acids, which are potential endopeptidase cleavage sites. The
8-amino acid human NPFF is identical to bovine NPFF but is predicted to
be cleaved from its precursor polypeptide with an additional 3 amino
acids at its N terminus; this 11-amino acid peptide is named NPSF. In an
experiment measuring the effects of NPFF and NPSF on neural activity in
rat spinal cord, bovine NPFF was active, whereas NPSF was inactive. The
authors suggested that the 3 N-terminal amino acids of NPSF are removed
by a peptidase to form the functional NPFF peptide. The 18-amino acid
human NPAF differs from bovine NPAF by 2 amino acids. Human and bovine
NPAF modulated neural activity in rat spinal cord in an
indistinguishable manner.

GENE STRUCTURE

The gene encoding the NPFF and NPAF precursor contains 3 exons (Perry et
al., 1997).

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MCAT (EC 2.3.1.39) is the catalytic subunit of the type II
malonyl-CoA-dependent system for biosynthesis of fatty acids in
mitochondria (Zhang et al., 2003).

CLONING

Zhang et al. (2003) cloned human MCAT, which they called mitochondrial
MT. The deduced 390-amino acid protein has an N-terminal cleavable
mitochondrial targeting signal, a GxSxG serine esterase active-site
motif, and conserved arg and his residues required for activity.
Fluorescence-tagged MCAT colocalized with a mitochondrial marker
following expression in HeLa cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Zhang et al. (2003) found that human mitochondrial MT expressed in
insect cells had a narrower substrate specificity than cytosolic MT
(FASN; 600212) and transferred a malonyl moiety to the mitochondrial
malonyl acceptor ACP (NDUFAB1; 603836) only.

GENE STRUCTURE

Zhang et al. (2003) determined that the MCAT gene contains 4 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Zhang et al. (2003) mapped the MCAT gene
to chromosome 22q13.31.

;;JUN ACTIVATION DOMAIN-BINDING PROTEIN; JAB1;;
SGN5;;
MOV34 FAMILY, 38-KD MEMBER
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using the more variable activation domain of JUN (165160) as bait in a
yeast 2-hybrid system, Claret et al. (1996) identified a protein, which
they called JAB1 for 'Jun activation domain-binding protein,' that
interacts with JUN and JUND (165162) but not with JUNB (165161) or
v-jun. As a result, JAB1 selectively potentiates transactivation by only
JUN or JUND. The JAB1 gene encodes a protein of 334 amino acids with a
relative molecular mass of 37.5 kD. The N-terminal region of JAB1 shows
57% identity to the products of the open reading frame F37A4.5 of C.
elegans and the S. pombe pad1+ gene, which was identified genetically as
a coactivator of a subset of AP1 target genes. The JAB1 and pad1+
proteins are functionally interchangeable. They define a new group of
coactivators that increase the specificity of target gene activation by
AP1 proteins. In vitro, JAB1 specifically stabilizes complexes of JUN or
JUND with AP1 sites and does not affect binding of either JUNB or v-jun.
Amino acids 31 to 57 of JUN, which are absent in v-jun, contain the
JAB1-interaction surface. JAB1 interacts with JUN and stimulates its
activity in mammalian cells. The 1.5-kb JAB1 transcript is widely
expressed. Immunofluorescence analysis indicated that JAB1 is a nuclear
protein. Although JAB1 does not form a heterodimer with JUN or JUND, its
effect on their DNA binding and transactivation abilities is analogous
to the effect of the Extradenticle coactivator on homeodomain proteins
of the Bithorax complex in Drosophila.

GENE FAMILY

Asano et al. (1997) identified JAB1 as a member of the MOV34 (PSMD7;
157970) family. They referred to JAB1 as the 38-kD MOV34 homolog.

GENE FUNCTION

Bianchi et al. (2000) found that JAB1 interacts with the cytoplasmic
domain of the beta-2 subunit of the alpha-L/beta-2 integrin LFA1
(155370/600065). Bianchi et al. (2000) found that JAB1 is present both
in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm of cells and that a fraction of JAB1
colocalizes with LFA1 at the cell membrane. LFA1 engagement is followed
by an increase of the nuclear pool of JAB1, paralleled by enhanced
binding of c-Jun-containing AP1 complexes to their DNA consensus site
and increased transactivation of an AP1-dependent promoter. Bianchi et
al. (2000) suggested that signaling through the LFA1 integrin may affect
JUN-driven transcription by regulating JAB1 nuclear localization. This
represented a new pathway for integrin-dependent modulation of gene
expression.

Using full-length macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF; 153620)
as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a brain cDNA library, Kleemann et
al. (2000) captured JAB1 as an interacting partner of MIF. By
coimmunoprecipitation and pull-down experiments, Kleemann et al. (2000)
confirmed the specific MIF-JAB1 association. Confocal microscopic
analysis demonstrated that the MIF-JAB1 complex is localized in the
cytosol near the peripheral plasma membrane, suggesting a potential
connection between MIF and the integrin signaling pathways. Luciferase
reporter and gel shift analyses showed that endogenous and exogenous MIF
inhibited JAB1-induced AP1 transcriptional activity but did not
interfere with nuclear factor kappa-B (NFKB; 164011) activity. Likewise,
recombinant MIF inhibited JAB1-stimulated and tumor necrosis factor
(TNF; 191160)-induced JNK (601158) activity. MIF also induced p27
(CDKN1B; 600778) expression and mirrored CDKN1B-mediated growth arrest
through inhibition of JAB1-dependent degradation of CDKN1B. Mutational
analysis indicated that a 16-residue MIF peptide spanning amino acids 50
through 65, including cys60, strongly competed with wildtype MIF for
JAB1 binding. Kleemann et al. (2000) suggested that signaling through
MIF-JAB1 is independent of a potential MIF receptor and noted that JAB1
is the only protein demonstrated to interact with MIF.

Gemmill et al. (2002) isolated the Drosophila homolog of TRC8 (603046)
and studied its function by genetic manipulations and a yeast 2-hybrid
screen. Human and Drosophila TRC8 proteins localize to the endoplasmic
reticulum. Loss of either Drosophila Trc8 or Vhl (608537) resulted in an
identical ventral midline defect. Direct interaction between Trc8 and
Vhl in drosophila was confirmed by GST-pull-down and
coimmunoprecipitation experiments. Gemmill et al. (2002) found that in
Drosophila, overexpression of Trc8 inhibited growth consistent with its
presumed role as a tumor suppressor gene. Human JAB1 localization was
dependent on VHL mutant status. Thus, the VHL, TRC8, and JAB1 proteins
appear to be linked both physically and functionally, and all 3 may
participate in the development of kidney cancer.

COP9 signalosome cleaves the ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8 (603171) from
the CUL1 (603134) subunit of SCF ubiquitin ligases. Cope et al. (2002)
found that the JAB1/MPN domain metalloenzyme (JAMM) motif in the
JAB1/COPS5 subunit underlies the COP9 signalosome's NEDD8 isopeptidase
activity. The JAMM motif consists of a his-X-his-X(10)-asp motif (where
X indicates any residue) accompanied by an upstream glutamate. The JAMM
motif is found in proteins from archaea, bacteria, and eukaryotes,
including the RPN11 subunit of the 26S proteasome. Metal chelators and
point mutations within the JAMM motif abolished COP9
signalosome-dependent cleavage of NEDD8 from CUL1, yet had little effect
on COP9 signalosome complex assembly. Cope et al. (2002) proposed that
JAMM isopeptidases play important roles in a variety of physiologic
pathways.

The marked box domain and adjacent region of the E2F1 gene (189971) are
critical for the specificity of E2F1 apoptosis induction. Using the
marked box domain of E2F1 in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a human thymus
cDNA library, Hallstrom and Nevins (2006) identified JAB1 as an E2F1
binding partner. JAB1 and E2F1 coexpression in rat embryonic fibroblasts
synergistically induced apoptosis, coincident with the induction of p53
(191170) protein accumulation. In contrast, JAB1 did not synergize with
E2F1 to promote cell cycle entry. Cells depleted of JAB1 were deficient
for both E2F1-induced apoptosis and induction of p53 accumulation.
Hallstrom and Nevins (2006) concluded that JAB1 is an essential cofactor
for the apoptotic function of E2F1.

MAPPING

Hartz (2004) mapped the COPS5 gene to chromosome 8q13.2 based on an
alignment of the COPS5 sequence (GenBank GENBANK U65928) with the
genomic sequence.

ANIMAL MODEL

Tomoda et al. (2004) found that Jab1 null mouse embryos died soon after
implantation. Mutant embryonic cells, which lacked other Cop9
signalosome components, expressed higher levels of p27, p53 (191170),
and cyclin E (123837), resulting in impaired proliferation and
accelerated apoptosis. Jab1 heterozygous mice were healthy and fertile
but smaller than their wildtype littermates. Heterozygous mouse
embryonic fibroblasts proliferated poorly, showed an inefficient
downregulation of p27 during G1, and were delayed in the progression
from G0 to S phase compared with wildtype cells. The levels of cyclin E
and deneddylated Cul1 were unchanged and p53 was not induced in
heterozygous mutant cells. Tomoda et al. (2004) concluded that JAB1
controls cell cycle progression and cell survival by regulating multiple
signaling pathways.

605687	TITLE *605687 INTERLEUKIN 19; IL19
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

IL19 belongs to the IL10 (124092) family of cytokines, which also
includes IL20 (605619), MDA7 (604136), and IL22 (605330). IL10 is a
multifunctional cytokine that has antiinflammatory properties through
its ability to downregulate antigen presentation and macrophage
activation. It also plays a role in B-cell activation and autoantibody
production (Blumberg et al., 2001).

CLONING

By searching EST databases using IL10 as probe, followed by screening an
Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B-cell cDNA library, Gallagher et al.
(2000) obtained a cDNA encoding IL19. The predicted 177-amino acid
protein contains a signal peptide, 2 potential N-linked glycosylation
sites, and 4 conserved cysteine residues necessary for correct folding
of the IL10 monomer. IL19 shares 82% identity with IL10 in the
hydrophobic core, but only 53% similarity in the putative IL10
receptor-alpha (IL10RA; 146933)-interacting residues. Western blot
analysis showed expression of a 35- to 40-kD protein that was reduced to
21 kD by glycosidase treatment.

GENE FUNCTION

Using Northern blot kinetic analysis, Gallagher et al. (2000) showed
that IL10 was expressed before IL19 in lipopolysaccharide
(LPS)-stimulated monocytes. IL19 expression was enhanced in the presence
of IL4 (147780) or IL13 (147683), but not gamma-interferon (IFNG;
147570), in LPS-stimulated monocytes. Granulocyte-macrophage
colony-stimulating factor (GMCSF; 138960), but not other cytokines, was
capable of inducing IL19 expression.

GENE STRUCTURE

Gallagher et al. (2000) determined that the IL19 gene spans nearly 6 kb
and, like IL10, contains 5 exons.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Blumberg et al. (2001) determined that the
IL10, IL19, 1L20, and MDA7 genes are tightly linked within a 195-kb
region, the IL10 family cytokine cluster, on chromosome 1q32.

606887	TITLE *606887 SULFITE OXIDASE; SUOX
DESCRIPTION Sulfite oxidase (EC 1.8.3.1) is the terminal enzyme in the oxidative
degradation pathway of sulfur-containing amino acids.

CLONING

Garrett et al. (1995) isolated a 2.4-kb cDNA clone of human sulfite
oxidase from a human liver cDNA library. The deduced 488-amino acid
protein has a molecular mass of approximately 52 kD and shows 88%
homology to the rat protein and 67% homology to the chicken protein.
Comparison of 3 sulfite oxidase sequences to several plant and fungal
nitrate reductase sequences revealed a single conserved cysteine with
highly conserved flanking sequences. Garrett et al. (1995) postulated
that the conserved cysteine is a ligand of molybdenum in sulfite oxidase
and nitrate reductase.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Kisker et al. (1997) determined the crystal structure of chicken liver
sulfite oxidase, which is homologous to the human protein, at
1.9-angstrom resolution. They found that each monomer of the dimeric
enzyme consists of 3 domains. At the active site, the Mo is
penta-coordinated by 3 sulfur ligands, 1 oxo group, and 1 water/hydroxo.
A sulfate molecule adjacent to the Mo identifies the substrate binding
pocket.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the sulfite
oxidase gene to chromosome 12 (TMAP sts-AA026389).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Kisker et al. (1997) characterized 4 missense mutations in the SUOX gene
(606887.0001-606887.0004) in cell lines from patients with isolated
sulfite oxidase deficiency (272300). The crystallographic results
predicted that 2 of these mutations (arg160 to gln, 606887.0001 and
ala208 to asp, 606887.0002) are near the sulfate-binding site, whereas
the other mutations (ser370 to tyr, 606887.0003 and gly473 to asp,
606887.0004) occur within the domain mediating dimerization.

Johnson et al. (2002) identified 12 novel mutations in the SUOX gene in
patients with isolated sulfite oxidase deficiency. These included 2
frameshift mutations, 2 homozygous nonsense mutations, and 8 missense
mutations.

Seidahmed et al. (2005) identified a 1-bp deletion in the SUOX gene
(606887.0005) in a male infant with isolated sulfite oxidase deficiency.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
SULFITE OXIDASE DEFICIENCY, ISOLATED
SUOX, ARG160GLN

In a cell line from a patient with isolated sulfite oxidase deficiency
(272300), Kisker et al. (1997) found a G-to-A substitution at nucleotide
479 of the cDNA of liver sulfite oxidase, resulting in an arg-to-gln
substitution at amino acid residue 160 (R160Q).

The R160Q mutation was identified by Garrett et al. (1998) in a
5-year-old girl with sulfite oxidase deficiency born of first-cousin
parents of Dutch descent. Recombinant protein containing the R160Q
mutation, expressed in Escherichia coli, contained its full complement
of molybdenum and heme, but exhibited 2% of native activity under
standard assay conditions. Absorption spectroscopy of the isolated
molybdenum domains of native sulfite oxidase and of the R160Q mutant
showed significant differences in the 480- and 350-nm absorption bands,
suggestive of altered geometry at the molybdenum center. Other studies
led to the proposal that under normal circumstances arg160 attracts the
anionic substrate sulfite to the binding site near the molybdenum.

SULFITE OXIDASE DEFICIENCY, ISOLATED
SUOX, 1-BP DEL, 1244G

In a male infant with isolated sulfite oxidase deficiency (272300) from
a consanguineous Arab family, Seidahmed et al. (2005) identified
homozygosity for a 1-bp deletion (1244delG) in the SUOX gene, predicting
a frameshift at amino acid 117 and resulting in a mutant protein of only
128 amino acids with total truncation of the molybdopterin and
dimerizing domains. The parents and 1 unaffected sib were heterozygous
for the deletion.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The HSD17B4 gene encodes an enzyme involved in peroxisomal fatty acid
beta-oxidation. It was first identified as a 17-beta-estradiol
dehydrogenase (Leenders et al., 1996; van Grunsven et al., 1998).

Peroxisomal beta-oxidation of fatty acids, originally described by
Lazarow and de Duve (1976), is catalyzed by 3 enzymes: acyl-CoA oxidase
(see, e.g., ACOX1, 609751); the 'D-bifunctional enzyme,' with
enoyl-CoA-hydratase and D-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity, and
3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (604054).

See also the L-bifunctional peroxisomal protein (EHHADH; 607037). The D-
and L-bifunctional proteins have different substrate specificities. The
D-bifunctional protein catalyzes the formation of 3-ketoacyl-CoA
intermediates from both straight-chain and 2-methyl-branched-chain fatty
acids and also acts in shortening cholesterol for bile acid formation.
In contrast, the L-specific bifunctional protein does not have the
latter 2 activities (Jiang et al., 1997).

CLONING

Adamski et al. (1995) cloned a fourth type of 17-beta-hydroxysteroid
dehydrogenase, HSD17B4, from a human liver cDNA library. The HSD17B4
gene encodes a 736-amino acid polypeptide with a predicted molecular
mass of approximately 80 kD and less than 25% identity with the 3
previously characterized 17-HSDs (HSD17B1, 109684; HSD17B2, 109685; and
HSD17B3, 605573). Northern blot analysis revealed that HSD17B4 is
expressed in many tissues as an approximately 3.0-kb mRNA transcript,
with highest expression in liver, heart, prostate, and testis. Adamski
et al. (1995) overexpressed the gene in mammalian cells and found that
HSD17B4 displays specific unidirectional oxidative 17-HSD activity.

Jiang et al. (1996) purified and characterized a medium-chain enoyl-CoA
hydratase from human liver. By immunohistochemistry, they confirmed the
presence of the enzyme in peroxisomes of cultured human skin
fibroblasts. Jiang et al. (1997) determined the DNA and peptide
sequences of medium-chain enoyl-CoA hydratase and found that it was
identical to that of human 17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase IV. The
native enzyme is a 77-kD polypeptide.

By analysis of the porcine enzyme, Leenders et al. (1996) determined
that the N-terminal region (residues 1-323) encodes the 17-steroid
dehydrogenase activity, whereas the central region (residues 324-596)
catalyzes the hydratase activity. The C-terminal portion facilitates the
transfer of 7-dehydrocholesterol and phosphatidylcholine between
membranes in vitro. The authors emphasized the unique ability of a
single protein to catalyze different reactions.

GENE STRUCTURE

Leenders et al. (1998) found that the HSD17B4 gene contains 24 exons and
spans more than 100 kb.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Leenders et al. (1996) mapped the
HSD17B4 gene to human chromosome 5q2.

GENE FUNCTION

Green et al. (1999) investigated HSD17B1, -2, -3, and -4 gene expression
and HSD17B estrogenic activity in human anterior pituitary adenomas.
HSD17B mRNA expression was studied by RT-PCR in 42 pituitary tumors and
3 normal pituitaries, HSD17B activity was studied in 11 tumors, and
HSD17B1 was immunolocalized in vitro in 6 tumors. HSD17B1 gene
expression was detected in 34 of 42 (81%) adenomas in all tumor
subtypes; HSD17B2 mRNA was detected in 18 of 42 (43%) adenomas but not
in prolactinomas; HSD17B3 mRNA was detected in 12 of 42 (29%) adenomas
but not in corticotropinomas; and HSD17B4 was expressed in 20 of 42
(48%) adenomas by all adenoma subtypes. All 4 HSD17B isoforms were
variably expressed in human anterior pituitary adenomas, which also
showed HSD17B enzyme activity, suggesting that HSD17B may play an
important role in regulating the local cellular levels of estradiol.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- D-Bifunctional Protein Deficiency

In 2 Japanese patients with D-bifunctional protein deficiency (261515),
Suzuki et al. (1997) identified 2 different homozygous mutations in the
HSD17B4 gene (601860.0001; 601860.0002). The patients had previously
been diagnosed with L-bifunctional protein deficiency by complementation
analysis (Suzuki et al., 1994).

In an infant with a defect in peroxisomal beta-oxidation, van Grunsven
et al. (1998) demonstrated D-bifunctional protein deficiency caused by a
homozygous mutation in the HSD17B4 gene (601860.0003).

In a patient with D-bifunctional protein deficiency originally reported
by Watkins et al. (1989), van Grunsven et al. (1999) identified a
homozygous 2-bp deletion in the HSD17B4 gene (601860.0007). The patient
was originally thought to have L-bifunctional protein deficiency based
on immunoblot analysis of postmortem liver tissue. However, reanalysis
showed accumulation of both very long chain fatty acids and bile acid
intermediates, which was hard to reconcile with an isolated deficiency
of the L-bifunctional protein. The results suggested that most, if not
all, patients whose peroxisomal disorder had been diagnosed as
L-bifunctional protein deficiency were in fact cases of D-bifunctional
protein deficiency.

Nakano et al. (2001) reported a patient with D-bifunctional protein
deficiency who was compound heterozygous for 2 mutations in the HSD17B4
gene (601860.0001 and 601860.0005).

Ferdinandusse et al. (2002) reinvestigated the patient of Goldfischer et
al. (1986), who was the only patient ever reported with a presumed
deficiency of peroxisomal 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (604054). Molecular
analysis identified a homozygous deletion in the HSD17B4 gene
(601860.0006), confirming a diagnosis of D-bifunctional protein
deficiency.

Ferdinandusse et al. (2006) reported the mutational spectrum of DBP
deficiency on the basis of molecular analysis in 110 patients. They
identified 61 different mutations by DBP cDNA analysis, 48 of which had
not been previously reported. The predicted effects of the different
disease-causing amino acid changes in protein structure were determined
using the crystal structures. The effects ranged from the replacement of
catalytic amino acid residues or residues in direct contact with the
substrate or cofactor to disturbances of protein folding or dimerization
of the subunits. To study whether there is a genotype-phenotype
correlation for DBP deficiency, these structure-based analyses were
combined with extensive biochemical analyses of patient material
(cultured skin fibroblasts and plasma) and available clinical
information on the patients. They found that the effect of the mutations
identified in patients with a relatively mild clinical and biochemical
presentation was less detrimental to the protein structure than the
effect of mutations identified in those with a very severe presentation.
These results suggested that the amount of residual DBP activity
correlates with the severity of the phenotype. Thus the data indicated
that on the basis of the predicted effect of mutations on protein
structure, a genotype-phenotype correlation exists for DBP deficiency.

Ferdinandusse et al. (2006) found that the missense mutation G16S
(601860.0003) is by far the most common mutation causing DBP deficiency
(type III), which had in their study an allele frequency of
approximately 24% and was detected in 28 of the 110 patients. The second
most common mutation causing DBP deficiency (type II) was the missense
mutation N457Y (601860.0004), which had an allele frequency of
approximately 11% and was found in 13 patients. Of 5 patients for whom
homozygosity was checked, 2 turned out to be heterozygotes at the
genomic level.

In DBP type I-deficient patients, Ferdinandusse et al. (2006) found only
deletions, insertions, and nonsense mutations. All deletions resulted in
a truncated protein, except for 3 large in-frame deletions. Two patients
with DBP type-II deficiency had in-frame deletions in the hydratase
unit. All other DBP type II-deficient patients had missense mutations in
the coding region of the DBP hydratase unit. DBP type III deficiency was
predominantly caused by missense mutations and, in 2 cases, by a 1-amino
acid deletion in the coding region of the dehydrogenase unit.

- Perrault Syndrome 1

Pierce et al. (2010) performed whole-exome sequencing of genomic DNA
from a woman with Perrault syndrome-1 (PRLTS1; 233400), which is
characterized by ovarian dysgenesis and sensorineural deafness,
originally described by McCarthy and Opitz (1985) and identified 2 rare
variants in the HSD17B4 gene (601860.0008 and 601860.0009). Sequencing
revealed that both the proband and her affected sister were compound
heterozygous for the missense (Y217C) and nonsense (Y568X) mutations,
and that their unaffected mother was heterozygous for the missense
mutation. Pierce et al. (2010) noted that Perrault syndrome and DBP
deficiency overlap clinically, and suggested that mutations in HSD17B4
leading to DBP deficiency that is mild enough to allow survival to the
age of puberty are likely to cause ovarian dysgenesis in females in
addition to the known neurologic defects. The authors predicted that
because the affected sisters were likely to express only protein with
the Y217C mutation, they would have so-called type III DBP deficiency,
with a defect in dehydrogenase activity.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
D-BIFUNCTIONAL PROTEIN DEFICIENCY
HSD17B4, 52-BP DEL

In a Japanese patient with D-bifunctional protein deficiency (261515),
Suzuki et al. (1997) identified a 52-bp deletion in the HSD17B4 gene,
resulting in a 17-amino acid deletion and premature termination. Studies
of postmortem liver tissue confirmed absence of the activity and
immunoreactivity of D-bifunctional protein. The patient was previously
thought to have L-bifunctional protein deficiency (Suzuki et al., 1994).

.0002
D-BIFUNCTIONAL PROTEIN DEFICIENCY
HSD17B4, 237-BP DEL

In a Japanese patient with D-bifunctional protein deficiency (261515),
Suzuki et al. (1997) identified a 237-bp deletion in the HSD17B4 gene,
resulting in a 79-amino acid deletion. Studies of postmortem liver
tissue confirmed absence of the activity and immunoreactivity of
D-bifunctional protein. The patient was previously thought to have
L-bifunctional protein deficiency (Suzuki et al., 1994).

.0003
D-BIFUNCTIONAL PROTEIN DEFICIENCY
HSD17B4, GLY16SER

In an infant with a D-bifunctional protein deficiency (261515), van
Grunsven et al. (1998) identified a 46G-A transition in the HSD17B4
gene, resulting in a gly16-to-ser (G16S) substitution within an
important loop of the Rossman fold forming the NAD(+)-binding site.
Biochemical analysis showed that the 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase
activity of the D-bifunctional protein was completely inactive, whereas
the enoyl-CoA hydratase component was active. Their findings showed that
the D-bifunctional protein plays an essential role in the peroxisomal
beta-oxidation pathway that cannot be compensated for by the L-specific
bifunctional protein. Both parents were heterozygous for the mutation.

Van Grunsven et al. (1999) demonstrated the G16S mutation in 9
additional patients previously thought to have deficiency of
L-bifunctional protein on the basis of complementation studies. The
findings confirmed D-bifunctional protein deficiency in these cases.

.0004
D-BIFUNCTIONAL PROTEIN DEFICIENCY
HSD17B4, ASN457TYR

In 2 unrelated patients with D-bifunctional protein deficiency (261515),
van Grunsven et al. (1999) identified a homozygous 1369A-T transversion
in the HSD17B4 gene, resulting in an asn457-to-tyr (N457Y) substitution.
Both patients had an isolated defect of the enoyl-CoA hydratase domain
of the D-bifunctional protein. Both patients had abnormalities of
peroxisomal beta-oxidation with elevated very long chain fatty acids and
branch chain fatty acids, but normal levels of bile acid intermediates.
Both patients were born of consanguineous parents. Sequence analysis of
the D-bifunctional protein cDNA of 15 control subjects of Caucasian
origin did not identify the N457Y mutation. Expression of the N457Y
mutation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae confirmed that it is the
disease-causing mutation. Immunoblot analysis of patient fibroblast
homogenates showed that the protein levels of full-length D-bifunctional
protein were strongly reduced, while the enoyl-CoA hydratase component
produced after processing within the peroxisome was undetectable,
indicating that the mutation leads to an unstable protein.

.0005
D-BIFUNCTIONAL PROTEIN DEFICIENCY
HSD17B4, ARG106PRO

In a male patient with D-bifunctional protein deficiency (261515),
Nakano et al. (2001) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations
in the HSD17B4 gene: a 317G-C transversion, resulting in an
arg106-to-pro (R106P) substitution, and a 52-bp deletion (601860.0001).
The mutations were associated with complete loss of function of the
protein.

.0006
D-BIFUNCTIONAL PROTEIN DEFICIENCY
HSD17B4, 138-BP DEL

In a patient with D-bifunctional protein deficiency (261515),
Ferdinandusse et al. (2002) identified a homozygous 138-bp deletion in
the HSD17B4 gene extending from basepair 145 in exon 3 through the first
63 basepairs of intron 3 of the DBP gene. This deletion resulted in
skipping of exon 3. The patient had originally been reported by
Goldfischer et al. (1986) and Schram et al. (1987) as the only patient
ever reported to have peroxisomal 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (604054)
deficiency. However, reanalysis showed normal thiolase and absence of
the D-bifunctional protein in brain tissue.

.0007
D-BIFUNCTIONAL PROTEIN DEFICIENCY
HSD17B4, 2-BP DEL, 422AG

In a patient with D-bifunctional protein deficiency (261515) originally
reported by Watkins et al. (1989), van Grunsven et al. (1999) identified
a homozygous 2-bp deletion (422delAG) in the HSD17B4 gene, resulting in
a premature stop codon at position 490 and a shortened protein of 163
amino acids. The patient was originally thought to have L-bifunctional
protein deficiency.

.0008
PERRAULT SYNDROME 1
HSD17B4, TYR217CYS

In 2 sisters with Perrault syndrome-1 (233400), previously described by
McCarthy and Opitz (1985) and Fiumara et al. (2004), Pierce et al.
(2010) identified compound heterozygosity for a 605A-G transition in
exon 9 of the HSD17B4 gene, resulting in a tyr217-to-cys (Y217C)
substitution in a very highly conserved region of the protein, and a
1704T-A transversion in exon 20, resulting in a tyr568-to-ter (Y568X;
601860.0009) substitution. Their unaffected mother was found to be
heterozygous for the Y217C mutation, and neither mutation was detected
in 1,092 control individuals. Expression analysis using lymphoblast cDNA
showed that Y568X transcript was expressed at very low levels relative
to the Y217C transcript, suggesting that Y568X undergoes
nonsense-mediated decay, whereas Y217C is more stably expressed.

600611	TITLE *600611 FK506-BINDING PROTEIN 4; FKBP4
;;T-CELL FK506-BINDING PROTEIN, 59-KD; FKBP59; FKBP52
DESCRIPTION For background information on FK506-binding proteins (FKBPs), see FKBP1A
(186945).

CLONING

Peattie et al. (1992) identified a novel FKBP using an FK506 affinity
matrix. By database analysis, 2 murine DNA sequences were identified,
and PCR primers to these were used to generate a probe for screening a
human placenta cDNA library. A translation of the human cDNA sequence
matched the original partial protein sequence, as well as primary
sequences for other FKBPs. The predicted protein, FKBP52, has a
molecular mass of 52 kD. Northern blot analysis detected FKBP52
transcripts at varying levels in all tissues examined. Peattie et al.
(1992) noted that FKBP52 is apparently identical to a 56- to 59-kD
protein referred to as p56, p59, or FKBP59 in the literature, and they
suggested that phosphorylation of FKBP52 may account for the multiple
reported isoforms.

GENE FUNCTION

Peattie et al. (1992) showed that FKBP52 associated with the 90-kD heat
shock protein (see HSP90A; 140571) in untransformed mammalian steroid
receptor complexes.

FKBP52 is a 'macro' immunophilin that shares high structural and
functional homologies in its N-terminal domain with FKBP12 (FKBP1A;
186945). Unlike FKBP12, however, it does not have immunosuppressant
activity when complexed with FK506. To investigate the physiologic
function of FKBP52, Chambraud et al. (1999) used the yeast 2-hybrid
system as an approach to find its potential protein partners and its
cellular role. They detected an FKBP-associated protein, which by
sequencing was identified as phytanoyl-CoA alpha-hydroxylase (PHYH;
602026), a peroxisomal enzyme. Inactivation of this enzyme is
responsible for Refsum disease (266500) in humans. Chambraud et al.
(1999) showed that PHYH has the physical capacity to interact with the
FKBP12-like domain of FKBP52, but not with FKBP12, suggesting that it is
a particular and specific target of FKBP52. Whereas the binding of
calcineurin (114105) to FKBP12 is potentiated by FK506, the specific
association of PHYH and FKBP52 is maintained in the presence of FK506.
These observations suggested that PHYH is a serious candidate for
studying the cellular signaling pathway(s) involving FKBP52 in the
presence of immunosuppressant drugs.

Fusco et al. (2010) demonstrated that RET51 (see 164761) activation by
both glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF; 600837) and NGF
(162030) triggers the formation of a RET51-FKBP52 complex. Substitution
of tyrosine-905 in RET51, a key residue phosphorylated by both GDNF and
NGF, disrupted the RET51-FKBP52 complex. NGF and GDNF have a functional
role in dopaminergic neurons, where RET51 and FKBP52 are expressed. To
clarify the contribution of the RET51-FKBP52 complex in dopaminergic
neurons, Fusco et al. (2010) screened both genes in 30 patients with
Parkinson disease (PD; 168600), in which dopaminergic neurons are
selectively lost. In 1 individual with early-onset PD, the authors found
heterozygous mutations in each gene, which together were sufficient to
disrupt the RET51-FKBP52 complex.

ANIMAL MODEL

Cheung-Flynn et al. (2005) found that male and female Fkbp52 -/- mice
were infertile. Male infertility in Fkbp52 -/- mice was due to
compromised androgen receptor (AR; 313700) function.

Tranguch et al. (2005) found that, in contrast to female progesterone
receptor (Pgr; 607311) -/- mice, female Fkbp52 -/- mice had no ovulation
defect. Gross and histopathologic analysis showed that Fkbp52 -/- uteri
were completely nonreceptive to blastocyst implantation. In situ
hybridization analysis in wildtype mice showed that Fkbp52 and Pgr
expression overlapped in uterine stroma, but Fkbp52 was also expressed
in luminal and glandular epithelium. Uterine refractoriness in Fkbp52
-/- mice was not due to altered expression of Pgr, for which Fkbp52 is a
cochaperone, or Fkbp51 (FKBP5; 602623). However, Pgr activity was not
optimal in Fkbp52 -/- mice, suggesting that the implantation defect was
due to compromised progesterone function. Northern blot and in situ
hybridization analyses showed downregulated expression of
progesterone-responsive genes in Fkbp52 -/- uteri. Tranguch et al.
(2005) concluded that FKBP52 is a critical determinant of uterine
progesterone actions in preparing the uterus for blastocyst
implantation.

Tranguch et al. (2007) demonstrated implantation failure in female
Fkbp52-null C57BL6/129 and CD1 mice. Progesterone supplementation
rescued implantation and decidualization in CD1, but not C57BL6/129,
Fkbp52-null females. Experimentally-induced decidualization in the
absence of blastocysts failed in Fkbp52-null females on either
background even with progesterone supplementation, suggesting that
embryonic signaling complements uterine signaling for this event. In
Fkbp52-null CD1 females, administration of progesterone at higher than
normal pregnancy levels was sufficient for implantation but failed to
maintain pregnancy to full term; elevating progesterone levels further
resulted in successful term pregnancy with normal litter size. Tranguch
et al. (2007) concluded that the requirement for FKBP52 in uterine
progesterone/PGR signaling is a function of genetic disparity and is
pregnancy-stage specific.

Chen et al. (2010) stated that male mice with targeted ablation of
Fkbp52 develop hypospadias. They found that Fkbp52 expression was
enriched in the ventral aspect of the developing mouse urethral
epithelium at embryonic day 18.5, when the final urethra normally forms
via closure of the enveloping epithelial layers. Scanning electron
microscopy revealed that Fkbp52 -/- males had reduced elevation of
prepucial swelling, leading to a defect in urethral seam formation. In
situ hybridization and immunohistochemical analysis suggested that
Fkbp52 mutants had a normal urethral epithelium signaling center and
epithelial differentiation, but Fkbp52 mutant ventral epithelial cells
had a reduced apoptotic cell index at the site of fusion and a defect in
genital mesenchymal cell migration in vitro. Supplementation of
gestating females with excess testosterone partially rescued the
phenotype. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed normal
occupancy of Ar at Ar-responsive gene promoters, but reduced Ar activity
at genes controlling sexual dimorphism and cell growth was observed.
Chen et al. (2010) concluded that Fkbp52 functions downstream of Ar in
urethra morphogenesis.

605722	TITLE *605722 POTASSIUM CHANNEL, INWARDLY RECTIFYING, SUBFAMILY J, MEMBER 16; KCNJ16
;;KIR5.1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir) channels are important for
regulation of the resting membrane potential and control of cellular
electrical activity. KCNJ16, or Kir5.1, belongs to the Kir family, but
it does not produce functional potassium channels when expressed by
itself. Instead, Kir5.1 appears to coassemble selectively with either
Kir4.1 (KCNJ10; 602208) or Kir4.2 (KCNJ15; 602106) to form novel
heteromeric channels (summary by D'Adamo et al., 2011).

CLONING

By EST database searching for sequences showing homology to mouse
Kir5.1, Liu et al. (2000) identified a human EST with 98% sequence
identity to a segment on chromosome 17. Using the full-length Kir5.1
mouse clone, they derived the human ortholog, designated KCNJ16, from
genomic sequence. The KCNJ16 gene encodes a deduced 418-amino acid
protein with a calculated molecular mass of 48 kD. The protein shares
over 95% sequence identity with both mouse and rat Kir5.1. RT-PCR
analysis detected ubiquitous expression of KCNJ16, whereas Northern blot
analysis detected significant expression of a 4.0-kb transcript in
kidney, pancreas, and thyroid gland. In situ hybridization demonstrated
expression of KCNJ16 in convoluted tubule cells of the kidney and in
acinar and ductal cells of the pancreas. Liu et al. (2000) noted that
Kir1.1 (KCNJ1; 600359), Kir4.1, and Kir4.2 are all expressed in kidney.
They suggested that heteromultimers of these potassium channel proteins
in kidney and pancreas may play a role in ion transport, fluid
regulation, and pH balance.

By database searching with sequences from rat Kir5.1, Derst et al.
(2001) independently assembled a human KCNJ16 cDNA, which they called
Kir5.1. They predicted that Kir5.1 encodes a protein of 418 amino acids
that shares 91% amino acid identity with rat and mouse Kir5.1. They
noted that Kir5.1 shares 40 to 43% amino acid identity with members of
the Kir2 gene family, including Kir2.1 (KCNJ2; 600681), Kir2.2 (KCNJ12;
602323), Kir2.3, and Kir2.4 (KCNJ14; 603953).

Using in situ hybridization, Derst et al. (2001) detected Kir5.1
expression restricted to the hindbrain, midbrain, and diencephalon in
rat brain. Using RT-PCR, they detected KCNJ16 expression in human kidney
in the proximal tubule, the thick ascending limb, and the cortical
collecting duct. They noted that KCNJ16 expression overlaps with Kir2.1
expression in some regions of the brain and kidney.

GENE FUNCTION

Derst et al. (2001) found that when Kir5.1 was expressed in Xenopus
oocytes, it was targeted to the cell surface and formed electrically
silent channels together with Kir2.1, thus negatively controlling Kir2.1
channel activity in native cells.

By electrophysiologic recording of HEK293T cells transfected with rat
cDNAs, Tanemoto et al. (2000) showed that Kir4.1, but not Kir5.1, formed
functional homomeric K+ channels sensitive to intracellular, but not
extracellular, pH. Heteromeric Kir4.1/Kir5 channels were functional and
showed channel properties different than those of homomeric Kir4.1
channels. For both Kir4.1 and Kir4.1/Kir5.1 channels, response to pH
disappeared at pH 5.5 and increased in a pH-dependent manner between pH
6.5 and pH 8.0. Kir4.1/Kir5.1 channels had larger conductance, altered
kinetics, and greater sensitivity to pH than Kir4.1 channels.
Kir4.1/Kir5.1 channels opened in bursts, and the closed period between
bursts was influenced by intracellular pH.

In cotransfection experiments, Tanemoto et al. (2002) showed that Kir5.1
assembles to form a functional homomeric potassium channel by
interacting with PSD95 (602887). Kir5.1 expressed alone was distributed
mostly in the cytoplasm, but Kir5.1 coexpressed with PSD95 was located
on the plasma membrane in a clustered manner. Using GST pull-down
studies, Tanemoto et al. (2002) identified domains responsible for
Kir5.1/PSD95 interaction. They found that protein kinase A
(PKA)-mediated phosphorylation of Kir5.1 disrupted the binding of Kir5.1
with PSD95. Tanemoto et al. (2002) hypothesized that Kir5.1/PSD95 forms
a functional brain potassium channel that may be a physiologic target of
PKA-mediated signaling.

GENE STRUCTURE

Derst et al. (2001) determined that the KCNJ16 gene is encoded by 5
exons spanning approximately 60 kb. They noted that KCNJ16 and KCNJ2 are
separated by only 34 kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Liu et al. (2000) mapped the KCNJ16 gene
to chromosome 17q25. By the same method, Derst et al. (2001) assigned
KCNJ16 to chromosome 17q23.1-q24.2, near KCNJ2.

ANIMAL MODEL

D'Adamo et al. (2011) found that, despite widespread Kir5.1 expression,
Kir5.1 -/- mice were born at the expected mendelian ratio, were viable
and fertile, and showed no behavioral or physical abnormalities.
However, whole-cell patch clamp experiments showed that neurons cultured
from the locus ceruleus (LC) of Kir5.1 -/- mice exhibited reduced
response to intracellular pH compared with wildtype LC neurons. Both the
kinetics and amplitude of firing of Kir5.1 -/- LC neurons were altered
in response to NH4Cl application or elevated soluble CO2. D'Adamo et al.
(2011) concluded that Kir5.1/Kir4.1 channels of the LC respond to
hypercapnic acidosis.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Antinucleolar antibodies are found in patients with scleroderma or
polymyositis or in patients with overlap of these 2 syndromes. The 2
most prominent proteins in this PMSCL autoantigen complex, PMSCL1
(606180) and PMSCL2, are detected as 75- and 100-kD molecules,
respectively. By screening a thymocyte cDNA library with PMSCL sera,
followed by 5-prime RACE, Ge et al. (1992) obtained a cDNA encoding
PMSCL2. The deduced 860-amino acid protein contains 2 potential
N-glycosylation sites and multiple potential phosphorylation sites.
Northern blot analysis revealed expression of a 2.7-kb transcript.
Immunoblot analysis confirmed the identity of native and recombinant
100-kD PMSCL2 proteins.

Using affinity-purified anti-100-kD antibodies to screen a HeLa cell
cDNA library, followed by probing a placenta cDNA library, Bluthner and
Bautz (1992) isolated a cDNA encoding PMSCL2. Sequence analysis
predicted that the 885-amino acid protein contains a stretch of amino
acids also found in serine/threonine kinases. Epitope mapping indicated
a major epitope is localized between residues 153 and 324.
Immunofluorescence microscopy using rabbit antisera raised against the
recombinant protein demonstrated nucleolar localization.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the PMSCL2
gene to chromosome 1 (TMAP stSG39098).

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By screening human brain cDNAs for the potential to encode proteins that
are at least 50 kD, Nagase et al. (1998) isolated an SLC21A9 cDNA, which
they called KIAA0880, that contains a complete coding sequence. The
predicted 709-amino acid SLC21A9 protein contains 8 membrane-spanning
regions. SLC21A9 shares 42.8% amino acid sequence identity with a rat
prostaglandin transporter across 678 residues. RT-PCR followed by ELISA
detected SLC21A9 expression in all human tissues examined, with the
highest expression in liver, lower expression in lung, ovary, brain,
heart, kidney, pancreas, spleen, and testis, and lowest expression in
skeletal muscle.

By searching EST databases for sequences similar to OATP (SLCO1A2;
602883), followed by RT-PCR of adult brain RNA, Tamai et al. (2000)
cloned SLCO2B1, which they designated OATPB. The deduced 709-amino acid
protein has 12 potential transmembrane regions and several
phosphorylation and N-glycosylation sites. RT-PCR detected OATPB
expression in adult pancreas, liver, lung, gut, ovary, testis, and
spleen, and in all fetal tissues examined.

GENE FUNCTION

Organic anion-transporting polypeptides (OATPs) are a family of
multispecific carriers that mediate the sodium-independent transport of
steroid hormone and conjugates, drugs, and numerous anionic endogenous
substrates. St-Pierre et al. (2002) investigated whether members of the
OATP gene family could mediate fetal-maternal transfer of anionic
steroid conjugates in the human placenta. They isolated OATPB from a
placenta cDNA library. An antiserum to OATPB detected an 85-kD protein
in basal but not apical syncytiotrophoblast membranes.
Immunohistochemistry of first-, second-, and third-trimester placenta
showed staining in the cytotrophoblast membranes and at the basal
surface of the syncytiotrophoblast. Trophoblasts that reacted with an
antibody to Ki-67, a proliferation-associated antigen, expressed lower
levels of OATPB. OATPB mRNA levels were measured in isolated
trophoblasts under culture conditions that promoted syncytia formation.
Real-time quantitative PCR estimated an 8-fold increase in OATPB
expression on differentiation to syncytia. Pregnenolone sulfate
partially inhibited OATPB-mediated transport of estrone-3-sulfate in an
oocyte expression system. The authors concluded that these findings
suggested a physiologic role for OATPB in the placental uptake of
fetal-derived sulfated steroids.

Tamai et al. (2000) overexpressed OATPB in HEK293 cells and found that
it mediated transport of estrone-3-sulfate and, more weakly,
prostaglandin E2.

MAPPING

By analysis of a radiation hybrid mapping panel, Nagase et al. (1998)
mapped the SLC21A9 gene to chromosome 11. By radiation hybrid analysis,
Tamai et al. (2000) mapped the SLCO2B1 gene to chromosome 11, between
markers D11S916 and D11S911.

612209	TITLE *612209 MESOGENIN 1; MSGN1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins are transcriptional regulatory
proteins that govern cell fate determination and tissue differentiation
in the embryo. Yoon and Wold (2000) identified a novel bHLH gene, which
they designated mesogenin-1, in mouse and Xenopus. In both organisms the
gene is specifically expressed in unsegmented paraxial mesoderm and its
immediate progenitors.

GENE FUNCTION

Yoon and Wold (2000) found that a striking feature of mesogenin-1
expression is that it terminates abruptly in presumptive somites
(somitomeres). In functional assays, mesogenin-1 from either mouse or
frog efficiently drove nonmesodermal cells to assume a phenotype with
molecular and cellular characteristics of early paraxial mesoderm.

To determine the mechanism controlling somite number, Gomez et al.
(2008) compared somitogenesis in zebrafish, chicken, mouse, and corn
snake embryos. They presented evidence that in all of these species a
similar 'clock-and-wavefront' mechanism operates to control
somitogenesis; in all of them, somitogenesis is brought to an end
through a process in which the presomitic mesoderm, having first
increased in size, gradually shrinks until it is exhausted, terminating
somite formation. Using MSGN1 expression as a readout for posterior
gradients, Gomez et al. (2008) were able to show that in snake embryos,
the segmentation clock rate is much faster relative to developmental
rate than in other amniotes, leading to a greatly increased number of
smaller-sized somites.

MAPPING

Hartz (2008) mapped the MSGN1 gene to chromosome 2p24.2 based on an
alignment of mouse Msgn1 (GenBank GENBANK AF261105) with the human
genomic sequence (build 36.1). Mouse and human MSGN1 share 90.2%
nucleotide sequence identity.

ANIMAL MODEL

Yoon and Wold (2000) found that deletion of the mouse mesogenin-1 gene
caused complete failure of somite formation and segmentation of body
trunk and tail, leading to complete absence of all trunk paraxial
mesoderm derivatives, including skeletal muscle, vertebrae, and ribs at
14.5 days postcoitus. Axial and lateral mesoderm developed normally. At
the molecular level, there was dramatic loss of expression within
presomitic mesoderm of Notch (see 190198)/Delta (see 606582) pathway
components and oscillating somitic clock genes that are thought to
control segmentation and somitogenesis.

601989	TITLE *601989 S100 CALCIUM-BINDING PROTEIN A13; S100A13
DESCRIPTION Wicki et al. (1996) reported the characterization of a human gene they
symbolized S100A13, a calcium-binding protein belonging to the S100
protein family. S100 proteins are small EF-hand calcium-binding proteins
of variable lengths and sequence identities. At least 12 of 15 members
of the family are clustered on chromosome 1q21 (see S100A1; 176940);
S100A13 likewise colocalizes with S100A1 on the 1q21 cluster. The
predicted 98 amino acid S100A13 protein shows sequence homologies to
other S100 proteins between 50.5% (S100A5; 176991) and 59.3% (S100A12;
603112). Northern blot analysis showed high amounts of S100A13 mRNA in
adult skeletal muscle, heart, kidney, ovary, spleen, small intestine,
and pancreas and in fetal lung, heart, cochlea, liver, spleen, and
parathyroid tumor cells. Moderate levels were detected in all other
tissues examined, with the exception of placenta and leukocytes, which
had very low or undetectable levels. Wicki et al. (1996) also cloned the
mouse S100A13 gene. Mouse S100A13 is composed of 98 amino acids and

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Hecht et al. (1995) identified the candidate region for the gene
responsible for hereditary multiple exostoses linked to chromosome 11
(133701) in an affected patient who also had a chondrosarcoma. By
positional cloning and use of a chromosome 11-specific fetal brain cDNA
library, Stickens et al. (1996) identified the putative EXT2 gene, which
was predicted to encode a 718-amino acid protein with a molecular mass
of 82 kD. Both protein and DNA sequence-based algorithms detected
significant similarity with the product of the EXT1 gene (608177),
suggesting that the 2 genes are evolutionarily and functionally related.
Northern blot analysis detected a major 3.5-kb mRNA transcript and a
minor band of 3.7 to 4.0 kb in most tissues. Stickens et al. (1996)
suggested that the EXT2 gene may be expressed as a complex set of
alternatively spliced forms.

Wuyts et al. (1996) constructed a contig of YAC and P1 clones covering
the EXT2 candidate region on chromosome 11p12-p11. The EXT2 region had
been defined in large families with multiple exostoses by linkage
analysis. They also defined the candidate region through deletion
analysis in families with the Potoki-Shaffer syndrome (601224). From the
EXT2 candidate region, Wuyts et al. (1996) isolated a transcribed
sequence with homology to EXT1. Alignment of the EXT1 and EXT2 genes at
the amino acid level revealed an overall sequence identity of 30.9%. The
amino acid homology is 18% in the 5-prime region and 48% in the 3-prime
region.

Stickens and Evans (1997) isolated and characterized the mouse EXT2
gene. They found that the mouse EXT2 cDNA contains an open reading frame
encoding a predicted protein of 718 amino acids. The mouse amino acid
sequence is 95% identical to the human EXT2 protein. Northern blot
analysis showed that the gene is expressed in early stages of embryonic
development, and in situ hybridization suggested that EXT2 plays a role
in limb development.

Clines et al. (1997) noted that at least 2 homologs of the human and
mouse EXT2 genes were found in Caenorhabditis elegans, suggesting to the
authors that the genes do not function exclusively as regulators of bone
growth.

GENE STRUCTURE

Clines et al. (1997) found that the EXT2 gene consists of 14 exons, plus
2 alternative exons.

MAPPING

By positional cloning, Stickens et al. (1996) identified the EXT2 gene
in the multiple exostoses type II critical region on chromosome
11p12-p11. Clines et al. (1997) mapped the mouse Ext2 gene to chromosome
2. Information on the mapping of the EXT2 locus to 11p12-p11 was
provided by Wu et al. (1994), Hecht et al. (1995), Wuyts et al. (1995),
and Blanton et al. (1996), using linkage methods.

GENE FUNCTION

Hecht et al. (1995) and Raskind et al. (1995) presented evidence
suggesting that the EXT1 gene on chromosome 8 and the EXT2 gene on
chromosome 11 have a tumor suppressor function. They found loss of
heterozygosity (LOH) for markers linked to these 2 genes in
chondrosarcomas originating in individuals with multiple exostoses as
well as in sporadic chondrosarcomas. To explain the fact that normal
bone growth occurs concurrently with abnormal exostosis tumor growth,
Hecht et al. (1995) and Raskind et al. (1995) proposed a 2-hit tumor
formation model according to the Knudson hypothesis (Knudson, 1971). In
this model, a single germline mutation results in the predisposition for
disease and a second somatic mutational hit, usually LOH, allows for
aberrant growth.

In addition to their presumed role as tumor suppressor genes, EXT1 and
EXT2 may have roles in modulation of the hedgehog signaling pathway (see
600725) and glycosaminoglycan synthesis. Bellaiche et al. (1998)
determined that the Drosophila homolog of EXT1, dubbed 'tout-velu,' is
required for diffusion of the signaling protein hedgehog. Lind et al.
(1998) concluded that EXT1 and EXT2 are glycosyltransferases, based on
copurification of EXT2 in a bovine serum extract exhibiting this
enzymatic activity as well as increased glycosyltransferase activity in
cells overexpressing EXT2 in vitro. Simmons et al. (1999) used a yeast
2-hybrid system to document a protein interaction between the EXT2 gene
product and a novel UDP-GalNAc:polypeptide
N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase. This interaction was abrogated by a
disease-causing EXT mutation. The authors contended that the data
described the first direct physical link between EXT proteins and
components of glycosaminoglycan synthesis.

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Simmons et al. (1999) found that a
conserved C-terminal region of EXT2 interacted with TRAP1 (606219) and
the glycosyltransferase GALNT5 (615129). Deletion of a conserved
histidine in EXT2 (his601) weakened its interaction with GALNT5 and
abrogated its interaction with TRAP1.

McCormick et al. (2000) noted that the proteins encoded by the EXT1 and
EXT2 genes are endoplasmic reticulum-localized type II transmembrane
glycoproteins that possess or are tightly associated with
glycosyltransferase activities involved in the polymerization of heparan
sulfate. By testing a cell line with a specific defect in EXT1 in in
vivo and in vitro assays, McCormick et al. (2000) showed that EXT2 does
not harbor significant glycosyltransferase activity in the absence of
EXT1. Instead, it appears that EXT1 and EXT2 form a heterooligomeric
complex in vivo that leads to the accumulation of both proteins in the
Golgi apparatus. Remarkably, the Golgi-localized EXT1/EXT2 complex
possesses substantially higher glycosyltransferase activity than EXT1 or
EXT2 alone, suggesting that the complex represents the biologically
relevant form of the enzyme(s). These findings provided a rationale for
the causation of hereditary multiple exostoses by loss of activity in
either of the 2 EXT genes.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a family with multiple exostoses (133701), Stickens et al. (1996)
identified a 4-bp deletion in the EXT2 gene (608210.0001), resulting in
a premature stop codon and truncated gene product. Stickens et al.
(1996) speculated that a second mutation event was necessary for the
development of exostoses, thus accounting for the asymmetry of exostoses
observed in the long bones.

In 2 families with multiple exostoses, Wuyts et al. (1996) identified 2
different mutations in the EXT2 gene: a nonsense mutation (608210.0002)
and a splice site mutation (608210.0003). In 5 of 17 (29%) families with
hereditary multiple exostoses, Philippe et al. (1997) identified 4
mutations in the EXT2 gene, including a missense mutation (608210.0004)
and 3 alterations that resulted in premature stop codons. Seven (41%) of
the families had mutations in the EXT1 gene.

Wuyts et al. (1998) analyzed the EXT1 and EXT2 genes in 26 EXT families
originating from 9 countries. Of the 26 families, 10 had an EXT1
mutation and 10 had an EXT2 mutation. Twelve of these mutations had not
previously been described. From a review of these and previously
reported mutations, Wuyts et al. (1998) concluded that mutations in
either the EXT1 or the EXT2 gene are responsible for most cases of
multiple exostoses. Most of the mutations in these 2 genes cause
premature termination of the EXT proteins, whereas missense mutations
are rare. The authors concluded that the development of exostoses is
mainly due to loss of function of EXT genes, consistent with the
hypothesis that the EXT genes have a tumor suppressor function.

Analyzing for EXT1 and EXT2 mutations in 34 sporadic and hereditary
osteochondromas and secondary peripheral chondrosarcomas, Bovee et al.
(1999) found mutations in the EXT1 gene, but none in the EXT2 gene.

Wuyts and Van Hul (2000) stated that 49 different EXT1 and 25 different
EXT2 mutations had been identified in patients with multiple exostoses
and that mutations in these 2 genes were responsible for over 70% of the
EXT cases. Most of the mutations caused loss of function, which is
consistent with the presumed tumor suppressor function of the EXT genes.

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Ligon et al. (1998) showed that
the EXT2 gene is deleted in patients with the del(11)(p11.2p12)
syndrome. Since patients with mutations in EXT2 have only multiple
exostoses, deletions affecting only the EXT2 locus cannot explain the
craniofacial anomalies, biparietal foramina, mental retardation, or
genitourinary anomalies observed in patients with proximal 11p
deletions. Therefore, deletion of other neighboring genes must be
responsible for the additional anomalies, and this chromosomal
aberration represents a true contiguous gene deletion syndrome.

Heinritz et al. (2009) identified 9 different mutations in the EXT2 gene
in 11 of 23 German patients with multiple exostoses. Eleven other
patients had mutations in the EXT1 gene; 1 patient had no detectable
mutations. Among the EXT2 mutations, there were 3 recurrent mutations,
Q172X (608210.0002), D227N (608210.0004), and Q258X (608210.0006), and 6
novel mutations (see, e.g., 608210.0007).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
EXOSTOSES, MULTIPLE, TYPE II
EXT2, 4-BP DEL

In a family with multiple exostoses type II (133701), Stickens et al.
(1996) identified a 4-bp deletion (784-787) in the EXT2 gene, resulting
in a frameshift and premature termination of translation, generating a
truncated EXT2 gene product.

.0002
EXOSTOSES, MULTIPLE, TYPE II
EXT2, GLN172TER

In a large EXT2 (133701) family, Wuyts et al. (1996) identified a 514C-T
transition in the EXT2 gene, resulting in a gln172-to-ter (Q172X)
substitution. The mutation was detected by SSCP analysis.

Heinritz et al. (2009) identified the Q172X mutation in a German patient
with EXT2.

.0003
EXOSTOSES, MULTIPLE, TYPE II
EXT2, IVSDS, G-A, +1

In a large Belgian EXT2 (133701) family, Wuyts et al. (1996) described a
G-A transition within a 5-prime donor splice site of EXT2, resulting in
aberrant splicing, exon skipping, and loss of 94 nucleotides of the
transcript (nucleotides 1080-1173) corresponding to amino acid residues
alanine-361 through glutamine-391. The deletion also produced a
frameshift and generated a stop signal at codon 404.

.0004
EXOSTOSES, MULTIPLE, TYPE II
EXT2, ASP227ASN

In 2 families with multiple exostoses type II (133701), Philippe et al.
(1997) found that the probands had a G-A transition in exon 4 of the
EXT2 gene, resulting in an asp227-to-asn (D227N) substitution.

Heinritz et al. (2009) identified the D227N mutation in 3 unrelated
German patients with multiple exostoses. One patient developed a pelvic
chondrosarcoma at age 40 years: tumor DNA showed loss of heterozygosity
at the EXT1 and EXT2 loci.

.0005
EXOSTOSES, MULTIPLE, TYPE II
EXT2, TYR222TER

In a family with multiple exostoses type II (133701), Philippe et al.
(1997) found a C-G transversion in exon 4 of the EXT2 gene, resulting in
a stop codon (Y222X).

.0006
EXOSTOSES, MULTIPLE, TYPE II
EXT2, GLN258TER

In a German patient with multiple exostoses type II (113701), Heinritz
et al. (2009) identified a heterozygous 772C-T transition in the EXT2
gene, resulting in a gln258-to-ter (Q258X) substitution.

.0007
EXOSTOSES, MULTIPLE, TYPE II
EXT2, IVS4AS, A-C, -2

In a German patient with multiple exotoses type II (113701), Heinritz et
al. (2009) identified a heterozygous A-to-C transversion (744-2A-C) in a
highly conserved nucleotide in intron 4 of the EXT2 gene. RT-PCR
analysis identified 2 different splice variants skipping either only
exon 5 or both exons 5 and 6. Loss of exon 5 results in a frameshift and
premature termination, whereas loss of exons 5 and 6 leads to an
in-frame deletion of 112 residues important for catalytic activity of
the protein.

606110	TITLE *606110 LY6/NEUROTOXIN 1; LYNX1
;;SECRETED LY6/PLAUR DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 2; SLURP2;;
SECRETED LY6/UPAR-RELATED PROTEIN 2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The LYNX1 gene encodes a protein that shares characteristics with toxins
that bind and inhibit nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR; see,
e.g., CHRNA1, 100690) (Miwa et al., 1999). Components of snake venoms
often have structural and functional mammalian homologs. For example,
hemolytic snake venom toxins are related to cellular phospholipases
(e.g., PLA2G1B; 172410), and snake sarafotoxins may be related to
vertebrate endothelins (e.g., EDN1; 131240). The elapid venom
alpha-bungarotoxin also binds to and inhibits nAChR.

CLONING

By screening for central nervous system-specific, developmentally
regulated cDNAs in mouse, Miwa et al. (1999) identified a cDNA encoding
GC26, which was expressed in mouse cerebellum. Sequence analysis
predicted that the 116-amino acid protein contains a signal sequence at
its N terminus, a cysteine-rich consensus motif characteristic of LY6
family proteins (e.g., CD59; 107271) and snake alpha-neurotoxins, and an
asparagine/GPI anchor motif at its C terminus. The overall structure of
GC26 is similar to that of LY6 family proteins and snake
alpha-neurotoxins, and Miwa et al. (1999) redesignated the protein
'Ly6/neurotoxin-1,' or Lynx1. A partial sequence encoding a human Lynx1
homolog has been identified (GenBank GENBANK AF321824). Northern blot
analysis revealed predominant expression of Lynx1 in mouse brain. In
situ hybridization analysis showed Lynx1 expression in neurons in
multiple brain structures. Immunocytochemistry demonstrated expression
of Lynx1 in neuronal soma and proximal dendrites.

Using microarray analysis to identify ESTs expressed predominantly in
the skin of patients with psoriasis vulgaris (see 177900), followed by
PCR and RACE of cultured keratinocyte cDNA libraries, Tsuji et al.
(2003) cloned LYNX1, which they called SLURP2. The deduced 97-amino acid
protein contains a signal peptide and 10 conserved cysteine residues
with a spacing pattern characteristic of the LY6 superfamily, but it
does not have the GPI anchor or transmembrane domains found in
membrane-bound LY6 proteins. Northern blot analysis detected a 0.6-kb
transcript in esophagus and a 1.6-kb transcript in stomach and duodenum.
No expression was detected in other tissues examined, including skin.
RT-PCR detected abundant LYNX1 expression in cervix and esophagus, with
lower expression in adult and fetal skin and keratinocytes. Weak
expression was detected in brain, lung, stomach, small intestine, colon,
rectum, uterus, and thymus. No expression was detected in spleen and
bone marrow. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis detected a 3.8- to
2.8-fold increase in LYNX1 expression in lesional skin from 5 psoriasis
patients compared with nonlesional skin or normal skin.

GENE FUNCTION

Functional analysis by Miwa et al. (1999) indicated that Lynx1 is not a
ligand or neurotransmitter but has the capacity to enhance nicotinic
acetylcholine receptor function in the presence of acetylcholine.

Morishita et al. (2010) identified an increase in expression of Lynx1
protein in mice that prevented plasticity in the primary visual cortex
late in life. Removal of this molecular brake enhanced nicotinic
acetylcholine receptor signaling. Lynx1 expression thus maintains
stability of mature cortical networks in the presence of cholinergic
innervation. Morishita et al. (2010) concluded that modulating the
balance between excitatory and inhibitory circuits reactivates visual
plasticity.

GENE STRUCTURE

Tsuji et al. (2003) determined that the LYNX1 gene contains 3 exons and
spans about 5.6 kb. The promoter region contains 3 Sp1 (189906)- and 2
AP1 (165160)-binding sites, as well as single sites for E2F (189971) and
GATA3 (131320). It lacks TATA and CAAT consensus sequences. There are 2
major transcriptional initiation sites.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Tsuji et al. (2003) mapped the LYNX1 gene
to chromosome 8q24.3. Southern blot analysis indicated that LYNX1 is a
single-copy gene.

EVOLUTION

Human evolution is characterized by a dramatic increase in brain size
and complexity. To probe its genetic basis, Dorus et al. (2004) examined
the evolution of genes involved in diverse aspects of nervous system
biology. These genes, including LYNX1, displayed significantly higher
rates of protein evolution in primates than in rodents. This trend was
most pronounced for the subset of genes implicated in nervous system
development. Moreover, within primates, the acceleration of protein
evolution was most prominent in the lineage leading from ancestral
primates to humans. Dorus et al. (2004) concluded that the phenotypic
evolution of the human nervous system has a salient molecular correlate,
i.e., accelerated evolution of the underlying genes, particularly those
linked to nervous system development.

ANIMAL MODEL

Miwa et al. (2006) found that Lynx1 -/- mice showed no gross
abnormalities in size, viability, CNS morphology, or longevity compared
to wildtype mice. However, Lynx1-null mice showed increased learning and
memory in a fear-conditioned paradigm and displayed increased
sensitivity to nicotine in motor tasks compared to wildtype. Neurons
from Lynx1-null mice showed heightened sensitivity and increased
intracellular calcium levels in response to nicotine. Loss of Lynx1
decreased receptor desensitization and enhanced synaptic efficacy.
Mutant neurons were also more sensitive to excitotoxic insult, and Lynx1
mutant mice exhibited age-dependent degeneration that was exacerbated by
nicotine and rescued by null mutations in nAChR subunits. These data
supported the hypotheses that Lynx1 normally decreases activity of
nAChRs and that deletion of Lynx1 shifts the balance in favor of
increased neuronal activity and synaptic plasticity. But the short-term
benefits of the loss of Lynx1 were counterbalanced by an increased
vulnerability of Lynx1 mutant neurons to glutamate toxicity and by loss
of nicotine's neuroprotective effect on these cells. Miwa et al. (2006)
concluded that Lynx1 modulates nAChR function to maintain low
sensitivity and plays a critical role in maintaining a balance between
the beneficial effects of short-term nAChR activation and the
degenerative effects of chronic receptor activation.

612616	TITLE *612616 LATE CORNIFIED ENVELOPE PROTEIN 3D; LCE3D
;;LATE ENVELOPE PROTEIN 16; LEP16
DESCRIPTION For background information on the LCE gene cluster, see 612603.

CLONING

By database analysis to identify human orthologs of mouse genes encoding
late envelope proteins (LEPs), Marshall et al. (2001) identified LCE3D,
which they called LEP16.

Using real-time PCR, Jackson et al. (2005) detected very low LCE3D
expression in adult and fetal skin. Low expression was also detected in
internal epithelia, including vulva, tongue, and esophagus.

GENE STRUCTURE

Jackson et al. (2005) determined that LCE3D is a single-exon gene.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Marshall et al. (2001) mapped the LCE3D
gene within the LCE gene cluster on chromosome 1q21. Jackson et al.
(2005) determined that the LCE3D gene is located within intron 2 of the
LCE3C gene (612615) and is oriented in the opposite direction. They
stated that the mouse Lce3d gene maps to a syntenic LCE gene cluster on
chromosome 3F1.
