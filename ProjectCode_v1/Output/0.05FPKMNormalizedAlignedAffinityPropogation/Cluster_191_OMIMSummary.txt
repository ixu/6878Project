GPR54 METASTIN RECEPTOR
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Lee et al. (1999) isolated rat brain cDNAs encoding a novel GPCR, which
they designated GPR54. The predicted protein shares 44 to 45% and 37%
sequence identity in the transmembrane regions with the rat galanin
receptors (see 600377) and delta-1 opioid receptor (165195),
respectively. Northern blot analysis and in situ hybridization indicated
that rat GPR54 has a complex and abundant central nervous system and
peripheral tissue expression pattern. Lee et al. (1999) also identified
the human gene. The predicted 398-amino acid human protein is 81%
identical to rat GPR54. GPR54 is expressed in the human brain, pituitary
gland, and placenta, as assessed by RT-PCR (Muir et al., 2001; Kotani et
al., 2001).

GENE STRUCTURE

Lee et al. (1999) showed that the human GPR54 gene contains 5 exons.

MAPPING

By searching a sequence database, Lee et al. (1999) identified a human
GPR54 ortholog within a contig (GenBank GENBANK AC005379) from
chromosome 19p13.3.

GENE FUNCTION

Ohtaki et al. (2001) isolated a carboxy-terminally amidated peptide of
KISS1 (603286) from human placenta as the endogenous ligand of GPR54.
They named the truncated form of KISS1 'metastin.' Metastin inhibits
chemotaxis and invasion of GPR54-transfected CHO cells in vitro and
attenuates pulmonary metastasis of GPR54-transfected B16-BL6 melanomas
in vivo.

KISS1 is a human metastasis suppressor gene whose product, metastin, had
been identified as the endogenous agonist for GPR54, a Gq/11-coupled
receptor (metastin receptor). Ringel et al. (2002) measured metastin and
metastin receptor mRNA levels in 10 follicular carcinomas and 13
papillary carcinomas, 2 benign nonfunctioning follicular adenomas, and
11 normal thyroid samples, and evaluated the signaling pathways
activated by metastin in ARO thyroid cancer cells that express the
metastin receptor endogenously. Metastin receptor was not expressed in
any normal thyroid or benign follicular adenoma samples, and was
expressed in only a minority (2 of 10) of follicular carcinoma samples.
However, the receptor was expressed in the majority (10 of 13) of
papillary carcinomas. Increased levels of metastin receptor were
detected in all 4 papillary carcinomas compared to adjacent normal
tissue. Incubation of metastin receptor expressing ARO thyroid cancer
cells with metastin resulted in activation of ERK, but not Akt. The
authors concluded that metastin and/or metastin receptors have a
potential role in modulating the biologic behavior of thyroid cancers.

Using real-time PCR, Shahab et al. (2005) found that the expression of
Kiss1 mRNA increased with puberty in both male and female rhesus
monkeys. Administration of kisspeptin-10 (112-121), a decapeptide
derived from KISS1, to agonadal juvenile monkeys induced a GnRH (152760)
response, as measured by a surge in plasma luteinizing hormone (LH; see
152780). In intact females, but not in agonadal males, the level of
Gpr54 mRNA in the hypothalamus increased about 3-fold from the juvenile
to midpubertal stage. In situ hybridization detected robust Kiss1 and
Gpr54 expression in the arcuate nucleus. Shahab et al. (2005) concluded
that KISS1 signaling through GPR54 in the primate hypothalamus at the
end of the juvenile phase of development may contribute to the pubertal
resurgence of pulsatile GnRH release.

Navarro et al. (2005) studied the effect of KISS1 peptide on LH
secretion using in vitro and in vivo settings under different
experimental conditions. Central intracerebroventricular administration
of KISS1 peptide potently elicited LH secretion in vivo over a range of
doses from 10 pmol to 1 nmol. The effect of centrally injected KISS1
appeared to be mediated via the hypothalamic LHRH. However, no effect of
central administration of KISS1 was detected on relative LHRH mRNA
levels. Likewise, systemic (either intraperitoneal or intravascular)
injection of KISS1 markedly stimulated LH secretion. Navarro et al.
(2005) found that LH-releasing activity of KISS1 was persistently
observed after blockade of endogenous excitatory amino acid and nitric
oxide pathways, i.e., relevant neurotransmitters in the neuroendocrine
control of LH secretion. Navarro et al. (2005) concluded that their
results provided solid evidence for a potent stimulatory effect of KISS1
on LH release, acting at central levels (likely the hypothalamus) and
eventually at the pituitary, and further documented a novel role of the
KISS1/GPR54 system as a relevant downstream element in the
neuroendocrine network governing LH secretion.

In a study of 6 healthy male volunteers, Dhillo et al. (2005) found that
elevation of plasma concentrations of kisspeptin significantly increased
circulating LH, FSH, and testosterone levels. Dhillo et al. (2005)
suggested that kisspeptin infusion may provide a novel mechanism for
hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis manipulation in disorders of the
reproductive system.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Hypogonadotropic Hypogonadism 8 with or without Anosmia

Puberty, a complex biologic process involving sexual development,
accelerated linear growth, and adrenal maturation, is initiated when
gonadotropin-releasing hormone (see 152760 and 602352) begins to be
secreted by the hypothalamus. Seminara et al. (2003) used complementary
genetic approaches in studies in humans and mice to identify the genetic
factors that determine the onset of puberty. In a consanguineous family
with members who lacked pubertal development (idiopathic
hypogonadotropic hypogonadism; see HH8, 614837), they searched for
mutations in the GPR54 gene. Functional differences between wildtype and
mutant GPR54 were examined in vitro. In parallel, a Gpr54-deficient
mouse model was created and phenotyped. Seminara et al. (2003) found
that affected patients in the index pedigree were homozygous for a
leu148-to-ser mutation in the GPR54 gene (L148S; 604161.0001) and that
an unrelated proband with idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism was a
compound heterozygote for 2 mutations in the GPR54 gene (see
604161.0002). Gpr54-deficient mice had isolated hypogonadotropic
hypogonadism (small testes in males and a delay in vaginal opening and
an absence of follicular maturation in females), but they showed
responsiveness to both exogenous gonadotropins and
gonadotropin-releasing hormone and had normal levels of
gonadotropin-releasing hormone in the hypothalamus. Seminara et al.
(2003) discussed possible mechanisms that would allow abnormalities of
GPR54 to cause pubertal delay. They concluded that GPR54 is a key
regulator of the biology of puberty.

De Roux et al. (2003) studied a large consanguineous family in which 5
sibs had hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and a normal coding sequence of
the gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor gene (GNRHR; 138850). By
homozygosity whole-genome mapping, they identified a novel locus for
hypogonadotropic hypogonadism on 19p13. Sequencing of several genes
located within this region showed that all affected sibs in the family
carried a homozygous 155-bp deletion in the GPR54 gene (604161.0004).
This deletion encompassed the splice acceptor site of the intron 4/exon
5 junction and part of exon 5. The deletion was absent or present on
only 1 allele in unaffected family members. The study showed that loss
of function of GPR54 is a cause of isolated hypogonadotropic
hypogonadism and also identified GPR54, and possibly its ligand KISS1
(603286), as playing a major and previously unsuspected role in the
physiology of the gonadotropic axis.

In a male patient with anosmic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, Miraoui et
al. (2013) identified 2 heterozygous missense mutations, 1 in the KISS1R
gene (A194D; 604161.0007) and 1 in the IL17RD gene (A735P; 606807.0003).

- Central Precocious Puberty 1

Gonadotropin-dependent, or central, precocious puberty (see 176400) is
caused by early maturation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis.
Teles et al. (2008) identified an autosomal dominant GPR54 mutation
(R386P; 604161.0006) in an adopted girl with idiopathic central
precocious puberty. In vitro studies showed that this mutation led to
prolonged activation of intracellular signaling pathways in response to
kisspeptin, the ligand of GPR54.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM 8 WITHOUT ANOSMIA
KISS1R, LEU148SER

Bo-Abbas et al. (2003) described a large Saudi Arabian family in which 2
brothers and a sister in 1 sibship married 2 sisters and a brother in a
first-cousin sibship. The family sought medical attention for
infertility. Six of the 19 offspring in the 3 sibships (4 men and 2
women), at least 1 from each mating, met the standard diagnostic
criteria for idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH8; 614837)
(inappropriately low gonadotropin concentrations in the presence of
prepubertal concentrations of sex steroids, normal anterior pituitary
function, and normal findings on imaging of the brain) and had
responsiveness to exogenous, pulsatile, gonadotropin-releasing hormone
(see 152760 and 602352). In all 6 affected members, Seminara et al.
(2003) identified a 443T-C transition in exon 3 of the GPR54 gene,
resulting in a leu148-to-ser (L148S) substitution in the second
intracellular loop.

In HEK293 cells, Wacker et al. (2008) performed biochemical,
immunocytochemical, and pharmacologic analysis of the L148S mutation,
located at a highly conserved residue in the second intracellular loop
of GPR54. They found that L148S mutation did not affect the expression,
ligand-binding properties, or protein interaction network of GPR54. In
contrast, diverse GPR54 functional responses were markedly inhibited by
the L148S mutation, with the mutant receptor neither initiating
G-protein dissociation nor activating phospholipase C (see 172420) or
ERK1/2 (see 176948). Fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis
strongly suggested that the L148S mutation impaired the ligand-induced
catalytic activity of G-alpha.

HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM 8 WITHOUT ANOSMIA
KISS1R, ARG331TER

Seminara et al. (2003) studied 63 unrelated patients with normosmic
idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and 20 patients with anosmic
hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. In 1 patient, a black man with idiopathic
hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH8; 614837), they identified compound
heterozygosity for a 991C-T transition in exon 5 of the GPR54 gene,
causing replacement of an arginine at residue 331 with a premature stop
codon (R331X), and a 1195T-A transversion in exon 5, which replaced the
stop codon at residue 399 with an arginine (X399R; 604161.0003). This
nonstop mutation resulted in the continuation of the open reading frame
to the poly(A) signal, with no intervening stop codon.

HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM 8 WITHOUT ANOSMIA
KISS1R, 155-BP DEL

By homozygosity mapping, de Roux et al. (2003) found that a locus on
19p13 was involved in hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH8; 614837) in
affected members of a sibship whose parents were first cousins.
Sequencing of several genes localized within this region showed that all
affected sibs carried a homozygous 155-bp deletion in the GPR54 gene
encompassing the splice acceptor site of the intron 4/exon 5 junction
and part of exon 5.

.0005
HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM 8 WITHOUT ANOSMIA
KISS1R, LEU102PRO

In 5 patients with isolated hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH8; 614837)
from 2 unrelated Arab-Muslim families from Syria and Israel,
Tenenbaum-Rakover et al. (2007) identified homozygosity for a 305T-C
transition in the GPR54 gene, leading to a leu102-to-pro (L102P)
substitution, which completely inhibited GPR54 signaling. Phenotypic
analysis revealed variable expressivity in the same family, either
partial or complete gonadotropic deficiency. LH pulsatility analysis
showed peaks with normal frequency but low amplitude. Repeated GnRH
tests performed between 12 and 21 years of age in 1 affected male
revealed progressive changes in pituitary response from an early
pubertal to an almost full pubertal pattern. Tenenbaum-Rakover et al.
(2007) concluded that GPR54 inactivation does not impede neuroendocrine
onset of puberty; rather, it delays and slows down pubertal maturation
of the gonadotropic axis. The L102P loss of function mutation in GPR54
results in a more quantitative than qualitative defect of gonadotropic
axis activation.

.0006
PRECOCIOUS PUBERTY, CENTRAL, 1
KISS1R, ARG386PRO

Teles et al. (2008) identified a heterozygous arg386-to-pro (R386P)
activating mutation in the GPR54 gene in an adopted girl with idiopathic
central precocious puberty (CPPB1; 176400). Functional studies indicated
that the mutation prolonged intracellular GPR54 signaling in response to
kisspeptin (603286).

HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM 8 WITH ANOSMIA, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
KISS1R, ALA194ASP

In a male patient with congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH8;
614837), who was anosmic and also had hearing loss, Miraoui et al.
(2013) identified heterozygosity for a c.581C-A transversion in the
KISS1R gene, resulting in an ala194-to-asp (A194D) substitution. The
patient was also heterozygous for a missense mutation in the IL17RD gene
(A735V; 606807.0003). The patient had a sister who also had anosmic
hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, and their parents were unaffected; family
member genotypes were unavailable.

610291	TITLE *610291 SYNAPTIC VESICLE GLYCOPROTEIN 2C; SV2C
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database searching for novel members of the synaptic vesicle
glycoprotein 2 (SV2) family followed by screening a rat brain cDNA
library, Janz and Sudhof (1999) identified a clone that they designated
SV2C. The SV2C protein shares 62% identity with SV2A (185860) and 57%
identity with SV2B (185861), and contains 12 transmembrane regions and a
protein kinase C phosphorylation site between transmembrane domains 6
and 7 in common with these proteins. Two negatively charged amino acids
in the first transmembrane domain constitute another conserved motif,
indicating that SV2C could transport positively charged substrates like
chloride or ATP. To characterize SV2C and compare its properties and
localization with those of SV2A and SV2B, Janz and Sudhof (1999) raised
an SV2C-specific antibody. Using this antibody, they showed that SV2C is
an N-glycosylated protein that is concentrated on small synaptic
vesicles; in addition, it is found on microvesicles in adrenal
chromaffin cells.

The human SV2C gene encodes a protein of 727 amino acids (GenBank
GENBANK NP_055794).

GENE FUNCTION

Using immunoblot analysis in subcellular sections from rat brain, Janz
and Sudhof (1999) evaluated the relative localization of SV2A, SV2B, and
SV2C. Analysis of the resulting staining patterns confirmed previous
conclusions that SV2A is ubiquitously expressed in virtually all
synapses. SV2B, although more restricted in distribution, was also found
in a wide variety of synapses throughout the brain. In striking contrast
to this general localization and to similarly wide distributions of
other synaptic vesicle proteins, SV2C was observed in only a few brain
areas. High levels of SV2C were found primarily in phylogenetically old
brain regions such as the pallidum, the substantia nigra, the midbrain,
the brainstem, and the olfactory bulb. SV2C was undetectable in the
cerebral cortex and the hippocampus, and found at low levels in the
cerebellar cortex.

Iezzi et al. (2005) characterized SV2A, SV2B, and SV2C and defined their
involvement in regulated insulin secretion. They observed that SV2A and
SV2C are associated with insulin-containing granules and synaptic-like
microvesicles in INS-1E insulinoma and primary beta cells, whereas SV2B
is only present on synaptic-like microvesicles. Neither overexpression
nor isoform-specific silencing of SV2A or SV2C by RNA interference
modified depolarization-triggered cytosolic calcium ion rises or
secretory granule calcium ion concentrations. Iezzi et al. (2005)
suggested that these data strongly argue against any calcium ion
transport function of SV2. Moreover, up- or downregulation of these
isoforms had no influence on potassium ion-induced insulin release,
suggesting that SV2 does not affect the calcium ion-dependent step(s) of
exocytosis. By contrast, Iezzi et al. (2005) found that glucose-elicited
secretion was inhibited during the sustained rather than the early
phase, placing the action of SV2 on the recruitment of granules from the
reserve pool to the plasma membrane. This conclusion was reinforced by
capacitance measurements in glucose-stimulated SV2C-deficient cells.
Like capacitance, evoked and basal hormone release were attenuated more
by silencing of SV2C compared with SV2A. Iezzi et al. (2005) concluded
that their data indicate only partial redundancy and highlight a key
role for SV2C in the secretory process.

Dong et al. (2006) found that botulinum neurotoxin A enters neurons by
binding to the synaptic vesicle protein SV2. Fragments of SV2 that
harbored the toxin interaction domain inhibited botulinum neurotoxin A
from binding to neurons. Botulinum neurotoxin A binding to SV2A and SV2B
knockout hippocampal neurons was abolished and was restored by
expressing SV2A, SV2B, or SV2C. Reduction of SV2 expression in rat
neuronal cell lines also inhibited entry of botulinum neurotoxin A,
which could be restored by expressing SV2 isoforms. Finally, mice that
lacked SV2B displayed reduced sensitivity to botulinum neurotoxin A.
Thus, Dong et al. (2006) concluded that SV2 acts as the protein receptor
for botulinum neurotoxin A.

Mahrhold et al. (2006) found that botulinum neurotoxin A interacts with
the synaptic vesicle glycoprotein SV2C but not with the homologous
proteins SV2A and SV2B. Binding of botulinum neurotoxin A occurs at the
membrane juxtaposed region preceding transmembrane domain 8. A peptide
comprising the intravesicular domain between transmembrane domains 7 and
8 specifically reduces the neurotoxicity of botulinum neurotoxin A at
phrenic nerve preparations, demonstrating the physiologic relevance of
this interaction.

601125	TITLE *601125 HEXOKINASE 2; HK2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Hexokinase (EC 2.7.1.1) catalyzes the first step in glucose metabolism,
using ATP for the phosphorylation of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate.
Four different types of hexokinase, designated HK1 (142600), HK2, HK3
(142570), and HK4 (138079), encoded by different genes, are present in
mammalian tissues.

CLONING

Printz et al. (1993) isolated rat HK2 cDNAs from a library prepared from
rat adipose tissue mRNA.

Lehto et al. (1993) described the isolation of genomic clones for human
hexokinase-2. These clones were isolated by screening a human placenta
genomic library with a rat hexokinase-2 cDNA clone.

Deeb et al. (1993) isolated human HK2 cDNA clones from a skeletal muscle
cDNA library. HK2 encodes a deduced 917-amino acid protein that shares
94% sequence identity with rat HK2 but only 72% sequence identity with
human HK1.

Heikkinen et al. (2000) found that mouse Hk2 cDNA is approximately 5.5
kb long and encodes a deduced 917-amino acid protein. The transcription
initiation and polyadenylation sites of mouse Hk2 mRNA are similar to
those of rat and human HK2. By Northern blot analysis, Heikkinen et al.
(2000) found that HK2 is primarily expressed in insulin-sensitive
tissues such as skeletal and cardiac muscle and adipose tissue. Minor
expression was detected in lung, spleen, ovary, and testis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Heikkinen et al. (2000) found that the Hk2 gene in the mouse contains 18
exons that span approximately 50 kb of DNA. The nucleotide sequence of
the proximal promoter shows a number of conserved putative transcription
factor-binding motifs.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Lehto et al. (1993) mapped the
HK2 gene to chromosome 2p13.1. They also screened human HK2 genomic
clones for dinucleotide repeats. Primers were selected to amplify an
approximately 224-bp CA-repeat-rich region. This repeat region was
highly polymorphic; the level of heterozygosity was 0.63 in Caucasians
and 0.51 in Chinese subjects. Lehto et al. (1993) carried out linkage
studies between this HK2 polymorphism and 9 markers on chromosome 2. No
recombinants were observed between HK2 and TGFA (190170) and D2S45; the
most likely map order with respect to several chromosomal markers was
determined.

GENE FUNCTION

Printz et al. (1993) found that HK2 mRNA was decreased in adipose tissue
from diabetic rats, but was restored by insulin treatment to levels
found in nondiabetic control rats. Insulin also induced HK2 mRNA in 2
adipose cell lines and 2 skeletal muscle cell lines. In one of the
skeletal muscle cells, this increase was accounted for by a
corresponding increase of HK2 gene transcription.

Deeb et al. (1993) suggested that genetic variation in hexokinase-2 may
underlie insulin resistance in peripheral tissues and cause
noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM; 125853).

The HK2 gene is highly expressed in rapidly growing tumors to facilitate
high rates of glucose catabolism. Mathupala et al. (1995) cloned and
characterized the promoter of the rat HK2 gene from a highly glycolytic
hepatoma cell line (AS-30D). Mathupala et al. (1997) showed that the HK2
promoter contains functionally active response elements for p53
(191170). Using coexpression assays, they showed that overexpression of
a mutant p53 gene found in the tumor cell line significantly and
reproducibly activated the HK2 promoter and increased HK2 gene
expression. Mathupala et al. (1997) stated that theirs was the first
report of a possible link between loss of cell cycle control in rapidly
growing cells and their high glycolytic rate.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Laakso et al. (1995), Vidal-Puig et al. (1995), and Echwald et al.
(1995) investigated HK2 as a promising candidate gene for
noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (125853). Laakso et al. (1995)
studied 40 Finnish patients with typical NIDDM and subsequently an
additional 72 patients with NIDDM. Among the 112 patients, ala314-to-val
was found in 1 patient, arg353-to-cys in 3 patients, and arg775-to-gln
in 3 patients. They also screened 97 subjects with completely normal
glucose tolerance and a negative family history of diabetes for these
mutations. The ala314-to-val and the arg353-to-cys substitutions were
not found in control subjects, but the arg775-to-gln substitution was
found in 2 control subjects. None of these mutations was located close
to the glucose- and ATP-binding sites of HK2. Laakso et al. (1995)
concluded that mutations of the HK2 gene are not a major etiologic
factor for NIDDM in the Finnish population. In the U.K., Vidal-Puig et
al. (1995) did a similar study with similar conclusions.

In a study of Danish Caucasians, Echwald et al. (1995) found several
amino acid substitutions in HK2. However, these, including a frequent
gln142-to-his mutation, did not seem to be associated with an increased
susceptibility to NIDDM or major abnormalities in whole-body glucose
effectiveness or insulin sensitivity. The frequency of the gln142-to-his
chain substitution was 18.9% among controls and 17.0% among NIDDM
patients.

Ardehali et al. (1996) reported identification of a TA repeat
polymorphism in intron 12 of the HK2 gene. The authors used the
polymorphism in linkage studies designed to investigate the mapping of
NIDDM in Pima Indians and to refine the map position of HK2 on
chromosome 2. Twenty different alleles were detected. Linkage studies
indicated the least recombination between HK2 and marker D2S286 (lod =
15.8 at theta = 0.02). There was no evidence of linkage of this HK2
polymorphism and NIDDM in Pima Indians.

606210	TITLE *606210 SELENOPROTEIN N, 1; SEPN1
;;SELN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Selenium deficiency can interfere with normal embryonic development and
fertility or promote the occurrence of certain cancers and viral
diseases. Selenocysteine, the major form of selenium in animals, is
directly involved in the catalytic reaction of selenoproteins.
Selenocysteine is encoded by an in-frame UGA codon. Avoidance of a
translational stop requires the presence of a selenocysteine insertion
sequence (SECIS), a hairpin conserved in the 3-prime untranslated region
(UTR) of all selenoprotein mRNAs. By searching an EST database for
sequences that can adopt a SECIS-like secondary structure, followed by
glutathione peroxidase functional analysis, further database searching,
and 5-prime RACE, Lescure et al. (1999) identified a partial cDNA
encoding SEPN1, which they termed SELN. Sequence analysis detected a
SECIS in the 3-prime UTR of SEPN1. Northern blot analysis revealed
ubiquitous expression of a 4.5-kb SEPN1 transcript, with highest levels
in pancreas, ovary, prostate, and spleen. Hemagglutinin-tagged SEPN1 was
expressed as a 60-kD protein in the presence of a wildtype SECIS element
but not a mutant SECIS element. Lescure et al. (1999) concluded that the
3-prime UTR is a repository of functional RNA motifs instrumental in
posttranscriptional control.

By 5-prime RACE and RT-PCR analysis, Moghadaszadeh et al. (2001)
characterized the full-length SEPN1 cDNA. They found that SEPN1 produces
a 4.5-kb transcript with an open reading frame encoding a 590-amino acid
protein. EST database searches and RT-PCR experiments predicted that
there are 2 isoforms of SEPN1. Isoform 1 corresponds to the full-length
transcript, whereas exon 3 is spliced out in isoform 2. Both transcripts
were detected in skeletal muscle, brain, lung, and placenta, but isoform
2 was always predominant. The exon 3 sequence corresponds to an Alu
cassette and contains a second in-frame selenocysteine codon.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Moghadaszadeh et al. (2001) determined
that the SEPN1 gene contains 13 exons and spans 18.5 kb.

MAPPING

By PAC analysis, Moghadaszadeh et al. (2001) mapped the SEPN1 gene to
1p36-p35, where the locus for rigid spine muscular dystrophy-1 (RSMD1;
602771) maps.

GENE FUNCTION

Using polyclonal antibodies directed against SEPN1 and cDNA constructs
encoding the 2 isoforms, Petit et al. (2003) showed that the main SEPN1
gene product corresponds to a 70-kD protein containing a single
selenocysteine residue. Subcellular fractionation experiments and
endoglycosidase H sensitivity indicated that SEPN1 is a glycoprotein
localized within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Immunofluorescence
analyses confirmed this subcellular localization, and GFP fusion
experiments demonstrated the presence of an ER-addressing and -retention
signal within the N terminus. SEPN1 was present at a high level in
several human fetal tissues and at a lower level in adult tissues,
including skeletal muscle. Its high expression in cultured myoblasts was
also downregulated in differentiating myotubes, suggesting a role for
SEPN1 in early development and in cell proliferation or regeneration.

Jurynec et al. (2008) found that the zebrafish ortholog of Sepn1 was
required for development of the slow muscle fiber lineage.
Downregulation of Sepn1 resulted in disorganized muscle myofibrils and
prominent Z-band anomalies not seen in wildtype muscle. Ryr1a (see RYR1;
180901) and Ryr3 (180903) were also required for formation of
normal-appearing slow muscle cells. Sepn1 stably associated with Ryr
proteins and functioned as a modifier of Ryr calcium flux activity and
redox responsiveness.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

The association between selenium deficiency and muscular dystrophy in
livestock suggests a role for selenium in the pathophysiology of
striated muscles. In humans, selenium deficiency is associated with a
cardiomyopathy known as Keshan disease, reported from selenium-deficient
areas of China (Ge et al., 1983). In 10 families with RSMD1,
Moghadaszadeh et al. (2001) identified 2 frameshift, 1 nonsense, and 3
missense mutations in the SEPN1 gene. The nonsense mutation
(606210.0002) identified in a French family transformed the
selenocysteine codon into a stop codon, preventing selenocysteine
incorporation and leading to a shorter protein. The missense mutations
changed residues that are conserved in vertebrates. Two of these mutated
residues were clustered in 1 region, the third being in close proximity
to the selenocysteine residue.

Multiminicore disease is an autosomal recessive congenital myopathy
characterized by the presence of multiple, short core lesions (known as
minicores) in most muscle fibers. On the basis of clinical and
morphologic data, Ferreiro et al. (2002) suspected a relationship
between classic multiminicore disease and RSMD1 due to mutation in the
SEPN1 gene. A genomewide screen, followed by the analysis of 1p36
microsatellite markers in 27 informative families with multiminicore
disease, demonstrated linkage to the RSMD1 locus in 8 families. All
showed axial myopathy with scoliosis and respiratory failure, consistent
with the most severe end of the classic multiminicore disease spectrum;
spinal rigidity was evident in some, but not all, patients. Screening of
SEPN1 in the 8 families that showed linkage and in 14 patients with
classic sporadic disease revealed 9 mutations affecting 17 patients in
12 families; 6 were novel mutations and 3 had been described in patients
with RSMD1. Analysis of 3 deltoid biopsy specimens from patients with
typical RSMD revealed a wide myopathologic variability, ranging from a
dystrophic to a congenital myopathy pattern. A variable proportion of
minicores was found in all samples. The authors concluded that RSMD1 and
the most severe form of classic multiminicore disease are the same
entity.

Clarke et al. (2006) identified a homozygous mutation in the SEPN1 gene
(606210.0008) in patients with congenital fiber-type disproportion
(CFTD; 255310), a congenital muscular dystrophy that has clinical
features similar to those observed in RSMD1.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
RIGID SPINE MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY 1
SEPN1, GLY273GLU

In affected members of 2 Iranian and 3 Turkish families with rigid spine
muscular dystrophy-1 (602771), Moghadaszadeh et al. (2001) identified a
G-to-A transition at nucleotide 817 of the SEPN1 gene, causing a
gly273-to-glu substitution.

.0002
RIGID SPINE MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY 1
SEPN1, SEC462TER

In a French family with rigid spine muscular dystrophy (602771),
Moghadaszadeh et al. (2001) identified a G-to-A transition at nucleotide
1385 of the SEPN1 gene. The mutation changed the selenocysteine (sec)
codon (TGA) into a stop codon (TAA), preventing selenocysteine
incorporation and leading to a shorter protein.

.0003
RIGID SPINE MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY 1
SEPN1, MET1VAL

In 3 unrelated families of Italian, Belgian, and German origin with
multiminicore disease (602771), Ferreiro et al. (2002) identified a
homozygous A-to-G transition in the start codon of the SEPN1 gene,
resulting in a met1-to-val (M1V) substitution. In the family from
Germany consanguinity was known. Two children in the family from Italy
were affected.

.0004
RIGID SPINE MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY 1
SEPN1, ARG466GLN

In patients with rigid spine muscular dystrophy (602771), Moghadaszadeh
et al. (2001) identified homozygosity for a G-to-A transition at
nucleotide 1397 of the SEPN1 gene, resulting in an arg466-to-gln (R466Q)
substitution.

In patients with multiminicore disease, Ferreiro et al. (2002)
identified the R466Q mutation in compound heterozygous state with a
trp453-to-ser (W453S) substitution resulting from a G-to-C transversion
at nucleotide 1358 (606210.0005). They also identified the R466Q
mutation in a compound heterozygous state with a 1-bp insertion (A) at
nucleotide 713 (606210.0006), resulting in a frameshift.

Jurynec et al. (2008) found that ryanodine receptors (RYRs; see 180901)
in muscle lysates prepared from muscle from a patient with congenital
myopathy and the R466Q mutation showed reduced ryanodine binding
compared with control tissue. Addition of wildtype zebrafish Sepn1
partially restored the binding capacity of diseased muscle lysates and
fully restored the ability of human RYRs from diseased muscle lysates to
respond to changes in the redox potential of the binding environment.

In a Portuguese family in which 2 children had multiminicore disease
(602771), Ferreiro et al. (2002) identified homozygosity for a T-to-G
transversion at nucleotide 1384 in exon 10 of the SEPN1 gene, resulting
in a sec462-to-gly (U462G) substitution.

.0008
RIGID SPINE MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY 1
MYOPATHY, CONGENITAL, WITH FIBER-TYPE DISPROPORTION, INCLUDED
SEPN1, GLY315SER

In 2 unrelated families with multiminicore disease (602771) from Belgium
and the U.K. that shared identical RSMD1 haplotypes, suggesting a
founder effect, Ferreiro et al. (2002) identified homozygosity for a
943G-A transition in the SEPN1 gene, resulting in a gly315-to-ser
(G315S) substitution. A German patient with sporadic multiminicore
disease presented the same mutation in the compound heterozygous state
with R466Q (606210.0004).

Venance et al. (2005) identified the homozygous G315S mutation in a
patient with rigid spine muscular dystrophy who presented at age 26
years with cor pulmonale characterized by rapidly progressive
respiratory and right heart failure with cough, orthopnea, and daytime
sleepiness. Two sibs who were heterozygous carriers of the mutation had
mild neck restriction. Venance et al. (2005) emphasized the importance
of early nocturnal ventilatory assistance in these patients.

Clarke et al. (2006) reported 2 sisters, ages 32 and 30, respectively,
with a diagnosis of congenital fiber-type disproportion (CFTD; 255310)
who were homozygous for the G315S substitution. Skeletal muscle biopsies
showed that type 1 fibers were at least 12% smaller than type 2 fibers,
and there was no evidence of multiminicore disease or other findings
typical of RSMD1. Clinically, the women had a severe congenital myopathy
with truncal hypotonia in infancy, progressive scoliosis, progressive
respiratory impairment, and osteopenia. One woman was wheelchair-bound
and had had bilateral hip fractures in her twenties. Three additional
patients from another family with congenital muscular dystrophy were
homozygous for the G315S substitution; however, skeletal muscle biopsy
from 1 of these patients showed only nonspecific myopathy and did not
fulfill the pathologic criteria for CFTD. All 5 patients had abnormal
glucose tolerance tests and showed biochemical abnormalities suggesting
insulin resistance.

.0009
RIGID SPINE MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY 1
SEPN1, 92-BP DEL

In 4 affected patients with Mallory-body myopathy (602771) who came from
a genetic isolate in northern Germany (Goebel et al., 1980), Ferreiro et
al. (2004) identified a homozygous 92-bp deletion in the SEPN1 gene
starting 19 bp upstream of exon 1 and including the first 73 bp of exon
1 (del92, -19/+73). The deletion caused loss of the translation starting
codon. The parents were heterozygous for the mutation.

182205	TITLE *182205 SEX HORMONE-BINDING GLOBULIN; SHBG
;;ANDROGEN-BINDING PROTEIN; ABP;;
TESTOSTERONE-BINDING BETA-GLOBULIN; TEBG
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a previously characterized liver cDNA as a probe, Gershagen et al.
(1989) isolated a liver-secreted plasma glycoprotein that binds sex
steroids. Screening of a human testis cDNA library resulted in the
isolation of 2 distinct cDNA forms. One was identical to the previously
characterized liver SHBG cDNA, thus suggesting that human SHBG and the
androgen-binding protein (ABP) produced by Sertoli cells are encoded by
the same gene. The second cDNA differed from the first by having exon 1
exchanged with a completely different sequence and exon 7 deleted.
Primer extension experiments showed that the alternatively spliced
transcript corresponding to the second cDNA is present in both liver and
testis. From the primary structure of the putative SHBG-gene-related
protein, Gershagen et al. (1989) deduced that the protein is very
different from SHBG and probably without steroid-binding activity.

GENE STRUCTURE

By Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA, Gershagen et al. (1989) found
evidence indicating that only 1 SHBG is present in the human haploid
genome. The gene has 8 exons.

MAPPING

By in situ hybridization, Berube et al. (1990) localized the SHBG gene
to chromosome 17p13-p12. By the study of intersubspecies backcrosses,
Joseph et al. (1991) found that Shbg is located on mouse chromosome 11
in close linkage to several neurologic mutations, one of which, Tr, is
associated with male sterility. The fact that ABP-SHBG is found
throughout the rat brain suggested that these mutations may represent a
defect in Shbg.

GENE FUNCTION

Testosterone in plasma is present in both bound and unbound form; only
the unbound hormone is biologically active and available to tissues.
About 66% of testosterone is bound to testosterone-binding beta-globulin
(TEBG), 31% to albumin, and 1.5% to transcortin; 2% is unbound. The
regulatory function of TEBG is said to be well illustrated by female
hirsutism; although many hirsute women have normal levels of total
plasma testosterone, nearly all have depressed levels of TEBG, resulting
in increased levels of unbound testosterone (Wenn et al., 1977; Raj et
al., 1978).

In mice expressing an 11-kb human SHBG transgene and in HepG2
hepatoblastoma cells, Selva et al. (2007) demonstrated that the
monosaccharides glucose and fructose reduced human SHBG production by
hepatocytes, irrespective of the presence of insulin, by downregulation
of hepatocyte nuclear factor-4A (HNF4A; 600281) and replacement of HNF4A
by COUP-TFI (NR2F1; 132890) at a cis-element within the human SHBG
promoter, coincident with repression of its transcriptional activity.
Dose-dependent reduction of HNF4A in HepG2 cells occurred in concert
with parallel increases in cellular palmitate levels and could be
mimicked by treatment with palmitoyl-CoA; inhibition of lipogenesis
prevented monosaccharide-induced downregulation of HNF4A and reduced
SHBG expression in HepG2 cells. Selva et al. (2007) concluded that
monosaccharide-induced lipogenesis reduces hepatic HNF4A levels, which
in turn attenuates SHBG expression, and noted that this provides a
biologic explanation for the sensitivity of SHBG as a biomarker of the
metabolic syndrome.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Cavalli-Sforza et al. (1977) developed an ingenious method for detection
of genetic variation in plasma proteins, namely, electrophoretic
screening after treatment with radioactive ligands such as vitamins,
hormones, metal ions and drugs. This is essentially a method of
'staining' the protein comparable to the methods using dyes. With this
approach they identified polymorphism of testosterone-binding
beta-globulin, as well as a possible silent allele. By polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (PAGE), Luckock and Cavalli-Sforza (1983) identified
4 electrophoretic variants, which they suggested result from
combinations of 3 alleles, designated N ('normal'), S ('slow'), and O
('absent'). The first 2 are codominant and the third recessive. The
frequencies of the 3 alleles in white Americans were, respectively,
0.68, 0.11, 0.21; in black Americans, 0.65, 0.14, 0.22; in Japanese
Americans, 0.59, 0.09, 0.32. Phenotype frequencies and segregation from
various crosses supported simple mendelian inheritance of an autosomal
gene.

By investigating neuraminidase-treated serum samples using isoelectric
focusing (IEF) followed by transfer to nitrocellulose membranes and
immunostaining, van Baelen et al. (1992) distinguished 3 patterns
consistent with the expression of a biallelic autosomal system. They
published data on allele frequencies in many populations and found
frequencies of the common allele (SHBG*1) varying from 0.848 in Chinese
to 0.985 in Balinese; monomorphism was found only in Australian
Aborigines, all 47 of whom were SHBG*1 homozygotes. Van Baelen et al.
(1992) found no significant difference for allele frequencies among
hirsute Belgian women. They also presented evidence that the subunit
produced by the SHBG*2 allele has a higher molecular mass than the one
produced by the SHBG*1 allele and that the 3 SHBG genotypes have
identical binding characteristics for 5-alpha-dihydrotestosterone.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Power et al. (1992) demonstrated in a Belgian patient homozygous for a
variant isoelectric focusing pattern that a point mutation was present
in exon 8, creating an additional site for N-linked glycosylation.
Expression studies showed that steroid binding was not affected. Hardy
et al. (1995) found the same mutation in Mexican subjects who were
heterozygous for the variant IEF phenotype. Denaturing gradient gel
electrophoresis (DGGE) was used to localize the mutation in these
subjects and to purify the variant allele for DNA sequence analysis. A
GAC-to-AAC transition in codon 327 caused an asp-to-asn substitution in
the protein (D327N). The site of the mutation does not lie within the
predicted steroid-binding site of the molecule. The finding in these
widely separated populations suggested that the SHBG gene is biallelic
worldwide. The polymorphism was not associated with any pathologic
condition.

Xita et al. (2003) investigated the possible association of the
functional (TAAAA)n polymorphism in the promoter of the SHBG gene
(Hogeveen et al., 2001) with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS; 184700)
and SHBG levels. They studied 185 women with PCOS and 324 normal
controls. Genotyping revealed 6 (TAAAA)n alleles containing 6 to 11
repeats. The distribution of these alleles was different in the 2
groups. Women with PCOS had a significantly greater frequency of longer
(TAAAA)n alleles (more than 8 repeats) than normal women who had shorter
alleles (fewer than 8 repeats) in higher frequency (P = 0.001). In the
PCOS group, carriers of the longer allele genotypes had lower SHBG
levels than those with shorter alleles. The authors concluded that SHBG
may be a susceptibility gene for PCOS and may provide the genetic link
for the developmental origin hypothesis for PCOS that was proposed on
the basis of experimental observations in prenatally androgenized sheep
and primates (Abbott et al., 2002).

In a population of 303 women referred for hirsutism, Cousin et al.
(2004) investigated the relationship between the D327N mutation in SHBG
exon 8, the pentanucleotide repeat polymorphism (TAAAA)n in the SHBG
5-prime untranslated region, and SHBG levels. The D327N mutant allele
was associated with higher SHBG levels than was the wildtype.
Multivariate analysis showed that BMI, PCOS status, and D327N
polymorphism influenced plasma SHBG concentrations, each of these
parameters contributing independently of the others. A strong
disequilibrium linkage was found between the D327N variant allele and an
allele with 8 TAAAA repeats (P less than 0.0001). The authors suggested
that this linkage disequilibrium could mask the effect of the TAAAA
repeat polymorphism on SHBG concentration in vivo. Nevertheless, SHBG
levels in patients who were homozygous for 6 repeats were significantly
(P = 0.043) higher than in 9-repeat homozygous patients and lay between
the two for 8-repeat homozygous patients. Results supported the notion
that polymorphism within the coding sequence and, potentially, in the
regulatory sequence of the SHBG gene is associated with circulating SHBG
levels and may represent part of the genetic background of sex steroid
hormone activity in humans.

For discussion of a possible association between variation in the SHBG
gene and type 2 diabetes, see 125853.

- SHBG Circulating Level Quantitative Trait Locus

Eriksson et al. (2006) studied whether either of 2 polymorphisms in the
SHBG gene promoter, a (TAAAA)n microsatellite and the SNP dbSNP
rs1799941, are associated with serum levels of SHBG (613498), sex
steroids, or bone mineral density (BMD) in men. In both cohorts,
(TAAAA)n and dbSNP rs1799941 genotypes were associated with serum levels
of SHBG (P less than 0.001), dihydrotestosterone (P less than 0.05), and
5-alpha-androstane-3-alpha,17-beta-diol glucuronides (P less than 0.05).
In the elderly men, they were also associated with testosterone and BMD
at all hip bone sites. Eriksson et al. (2006) concluded that
polymorphisms in the SHBG promoter predict serum levels of SHBG,
androgens, and glucuronidated androgen metabolites, and hip BMD in men.

In the NCI-Breast and Prostate Cancer Cohort Consortium using 874 SNPs
in 37 candidate genes in the sex steroid hormone pathway, Ahn et al.
(2009) identified a G-A variant (dbSNP rs1799941) located 67 bp upstream
from the transcription start site of the SHBG gene associated with
increased mean circulating levels of SHBG in 4,720 Caucasian men (p =
4.52 x 10(-21); 26.9% increase in AA homozygotes versus wildtype
homozygotes). The relationship between dbSNP rs1799941 was consistent
across the 5 cohorts in the study, age, BMI, and case-control status.
Additionally, dbSNP rs1799941 was also strongly associated with
increased mean circulating levels of testosterone in 4,678 Caucasian men
(p = 7.54 x 10(-15); 14.3% increase in AA homozygotes versus wildtype
homozygotes). Since clearance and bioavailability of testosterone are
related to SHBG levels, Ahn et al. (2009) used regression analysis to
show that also tended to predict SHBG adjusted-testosterone levels (p =
1.33 x 10(-3)).

HISTORY

Gross and Horton (1971) presented evidence indicating 'dominant'
segregation of the trait and low testosterone-binding protein, and
suggested Y-linkage. Hecht and Kimberling (1971) pointed out that since
the Y chromosome represents only about 2% of the human male haploid
genome, Bayesian correction of the estimate of Y-linkage reduces the
value to 1 in 3.

INTERFERON RECEPTOR 1-BOUND PROTEIN 4; IR1B4
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The PRMT1 gene encodes a protein arginine methyltransferase that
functions as a histone methyltransferase specific for H4 (see 602822).

CLONING

Protein arginine methylation is catalyzed by arginine
methyltransferases. The bulk of methylated arginine residues in
eukaryotic cells are found in heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins
(hnRNPs), RNA-binding proteins that play essential roles in the
metabolism of nuclear pre-mRNA. Lin et al. (1996) identified a rat cDNA
encoding PRMT1 (protein-arginine N-methyltransferase 1; EC 2.1.1.23).
Recombinant PRMT1 methylated histones and hnRNPA1 (164017) in vitro. By
using a yeast 2-hybrid screen to identify proteins that interact with
the intracytoplasmic domain of the interferon-alpha/beta receptor-1
(IFNAR1; 107450), Abramovich et al. (1997) identified a human cDNA
encoding a protein that was nearly identical to PRMT1. The deduced
361-amino acid protein was designated IR1B4 for 'interferon
receptor-1-bound protein 4.' Epitope-tagged IR1B4 bound the IFNAR1
intracytoplasmic domain in vitro. Antibodies against IFNAR1
coimmunoprecipitated a methyltransferase activity from human cell
extracts. An antisense oligonucleotide strongly reduced
methyltransferase activity in human cells, and caused them to become
more resistant to growth inhibition by interferon. Abramovich et al.
(1997) concluded that protein methylation, like phosphorylation, may be
an important signaling mechanism for certain cytokine receptors.

Scott et al. (1998) identified HRMT1L2 transcripts with variable 5-prime
ends that encode 3 protein variants with different N-terminal regions.
Rat PRMT1 and HRMT1L2 variant 2 (v2) share 95% sequence identity, but
diverge at their N termini. The amino acid sequences of HRMT1L2 and
HRMT1L1 (601961) are 27% identical. Recombinant protein methylated human
hnRNPA1 and a yeast hnRNP in vitro. The HRMT1L2 gene complemented
mutations in the yeast hnRNP methyltransferase gene HMT1. Northern blot
analysis revealed that HRMT1L2 is expressed as a predominant 1.4-kb mRNA
in various adult and fetal tissues. Additional larger and smaller bands
were observed in some tissues.

Scorilas et al. (2000) identified 3 splice variants of PRMT1, encoding
deduced polypeptides of 343 (variant 1), 361 (variant 2), and 347
(variant 3) amino acids with molecular masses of 39.6, 41.5, and 39.9
kD, respectively. The full-length protein (v3) contains an in-frame stop
codon in the middle of exon 3, and a second downstream start codon that
resumes transcription. Variant 2 is predicted to contain 3 hydrophobic
stretches, one of which may be a signal peptide. PRMT1 shares 96%, 34%
and 29% sequence identity with rat PRMT1, human PRMT3 (603190), and
human PRMT2 (HRMT1L1), respectively. RT-PCR revealed ubiquitous
expression of all 3 splice variants, with highest expression in
cerebellum, mammary gland, prostate, brain, and thyroid. The predominant
variant differed among tissues. By PCR analysis, Scorilas et al. (2000)
found that variants 1 and 2 were frequently downregulated in breast
cancers in comparison to normal breast tissue.

GENE FUNCTION

The S. cerevisiae ire15 mutation has an inositol auxotrophic phenotype
and a defect in the expression of the inositol 1-phosphate synthase
(INO1) gene. Nikawa et al. (1996) identified HRMT1L2, which they called
HCP1, as a gene that suppressed the ire15 mutation. Multicopy HRMT1L2
increased the level of INO1 mRNA in ire15 mutants. Both Abramovich et
al. (1997) and Scott et al. (1998) noted that the nucleotide sequence
reported by Nikawa et al. (1996) contained 3 deletions that resulted in
a frameshift between amino acids 147-175.

Wang et al. (2001) reported the purification, molecular identification,
and functional characterization of the histone H4-specific
methyltransferase PRMT1, a protein arginine methyltransferase. PRMT1
specifically methylates arginine-3 of histone H4 (see 602822) in vitro
and in vivo. Methylation of arg3 by PRMT1 facilitates subsequent
acetylation of H4 tails by p300 (602700). However, acetylation of H4
inhibits its methylation by PRMT1. Most important, a mutation in the
S-adenosyl-L-methionine-binding site of PRMT1 substantially crippled its
nuclear receptor coactivator activity. Wang et al. (2001) concluded that
their findings reveal arg3 of H4 as a novel methylation site by PRMT1
and indicate that arg3 methylation plays an important role in
transcriptional regulation.

Mowen et al. (2001) demonstrated that methylation of arg31 of STAT1
(600555) by PRMT1 is required for transcription induced by
IFN-alpha/IFN-beta. They concluded that arginine methylation of STAT1 is
an additional posttranslational modification regulating transcription
factor function, and alteration of arginine methylation might be
responsible for the lack of interferon responsiveness observed in many
malignancies.

Using systems reconstituted with recombinant chromatin templates and
coactivators, An et al. (2004) demonstrated the involvement of PRMT1 and
CARM1 (603934) in p53 (191170) function; both independent and ordered
cooperative functions of p300 (602700), PRMT1, and CARM1; and mechanisms
involving direct interactions with p53 and obligatory modifications of
corresponding histone substrates. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses
confirmed the ordered accumulation of these (and other) coactivators and
cognate histone modifications on a p53-responsive gene, GADD45 (126335),
following ectopic p53 expression and/or ultraviolet irradiation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Scorilas et al. (2000) determined that the PRMT1 gene (variant 3)
contains 12 exons and spans 11.2 kb, and that the 2 additional splice
variants contain 10 (variant 1) or 11 exons (variant 2). They found that
PRMT1 is located in close proximity to the IRF3 (603734) and RRAS
(165090) genes and is transcribed in the opposite direction. RRAS is the
most telomeric, followed by IRF3 and PRMT1.

MAPPING

By analysis of somatic cell hybrid panels and by fluorescence in situ
hybridization, Scott et al. (1998) mapped the HRMT1L2 gene to 19q13.
Noting sequence identity between HRMT1L2 and a BAC clone, Scorilas et
al. (2000) refined the mapping to 19q13.3.

Pawlak et al. (2000) mapped the mouse Prmt1 gene to chromosome 7 by
interspecific backcross analysis.

ANIMAL MODEL

Pawlak et al. (2000) characterized a null mutation of the mouse Prmt1
gene, which is 95% identical to HRMT1L2. Prmt1 expression was greatest
along the midline of the neural plate and in the forming head fold from
embryonic day 7.5 (E7.5) to E8.5 and in the developing central nervous
system from E8.5 to E13.5. Homozygous mutant embryos failed to develop
beyond E6.5, with death occurring shortly after implantation and before
gastrulation. Prmt1, however, was not detected in embryonic stem cell
lines established from mutant blastocysts, suggesting it is not
necessary for cell viability. Prmt1 -/- cells expressed approximately 8
times less methyltransferase activity than wildtype cells, indicating
that the loss of Prmt1 activity is not compensated by an increase in
other methyltransferases. In addition, high performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) and methyl acceptor activity analysis determined
that the cell proteins of mutant cells were hypomethylated, whereas most
potential substrates were already methylated in wildtype cells.

;;FIBROBLAST GROWTH FACTOR HOMOLOGOUS FACTOR 3; FHF3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

FGF11 belongs to a subclass of fibroblast growth factors that are
expressed in the developing and adult central nervous system (Smallwood
et al., 1996). For a discussion of the FGF gene family, see FGF12
(601513).

CLONING

Smallwood et al. (1996) identified and characterized 4 novel members of
the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family, including FGF11, which they
called FHF3. The genes were identified by a combination of random cDNA
sequencing, database searches, and degenerate PCR.

MAPPING

By Southern blot hybridization of genomic DNA from rodent/human hybrid
cell lines carrying individual human chromosomes, Smallwood et al.
(1996) mapped the FGF11 gene to human chromosome 17. A sequence tagged
site (STS), which encompassed 1 exon of FHF3, was derived from
chromosome 17 and mapped near the BRCA1 gene (113705) which is located
on 17q21.

By in situ hybridization, Verdier et al. (1997) mapped the FGF11 gene to
chromosome 7p13-p12.

603060	TITLE *603060 KINESIN FAMILY MEMBER 1C; KIF1C
;;LTXS1, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF; LTXS1;;
KIAA0706
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Kinesin family proteins (KIFs) are microtubule-based motor proteins.
Individual members mediate specific types of motile processes. See
(600025). To detect possible targets of the cytosolic protein-tyrosine
phosphatase PTPD1 (603271), Dorner et al. (1998) used the ezrin domain
of PTPD1 as the bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen and recovered human
skeletal muscle cDNAs encoding KIF1C. Sequence analysis revealed that
the predicted 1,103-amino acid protein belongs to the Unc104 subfamily
of kinesin-like proteins. See (601255). Like other members of this
subfamily, KIF1C contains an N-terminal motor domain followed by a U104
domain. On Western blots, KIF1C migrated as an approximately 135-kD
protein. Using Northern blot analysis, the authors determined that KIF1C
was expressed as a 4.2-kb mRNA in all human tissues examined, with the
most abundant expression in heart and skeletal muscle. By
immunofluorescence, Dorner et al. (1998) observed that KIF1C localized
primarily at the Golgi apparatus.

MAPPING

Gross (2012) mapped the KIF1C gene to chromosome 17p13.2 based on an
alignment of the KIF1C sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC034993) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

NOMENCLATURE

Lawrence et al. (2004) presented a standardized kinesin nomenclature
based on 14 family designations. Under this system, KIF1C belongs to the
kinesin-3 family.

GENE FUNCTION

Dorner et al. (1998) demonstrated that KIF1C was tyrosine-phosphorylated
and associated with PTPD1 in vivo. Disruption of the Golgi apparatus
with brefeldin A induced the flow of Golgi membranes and KIF1C to the
endoplasmic reticulum. This redistribution of membranes was inhibited in
cells overexpressing a catalytically inactive mutant KIF1C protein. The
authors concluded that KIF1C is required for the retrograde transport of
Golgi vesicles to the endoplasmic reticulum and that tyrosine
phosphorylation is a putative regulator of this transport.

ANIMAL MODEL

Anthrax lethal toxin (LeTx) is composed of 2 peptides, protective
antigen (PA) and lethal factor (LF). PA mediates the delivery of LF into
the cytosol of all cell types. LF exerts a macrophage-specific, zinc
metallopeptidase-dependent cytolytic effect. By comparative analysis of
BAC clones containing Ltxs1, the mouse locus on chromosome 11 that
controls LeTx susceptibility, Watters et al. (2001) identified
polymorphisms resulting in pro578-to-leu (P578L) or ser1027-to-pro
(S1027P) substitutions in the Kif1c gene in anthrax toxin-susceptible
mouse strains. P578L is located in the forkhead homology-associated
domain of Kif1c, while S1027P is in the C-terminal region associated
with cargo binding. Brefeldin A treatment caused macrophages from
resistant mice to become as susceptible to LeTx LF as Kif1c
heterozygotes and homozygote mutants. However, the longer MKK3b isoform
of MKK3 (MAP2K3; 602315) was subject to proteolysis in both resistant
and susceptible macrophages. Watters et al. (2001) proposed that Kif1c
functions downstream in the intoxication pathway and serves to protect
the macrophage from signaling events induced by LF proteolysis of target
proteins.

603304	TITLE *603304 INTERLEUKIN 1 RECEPTOR-ASSOCIATED KINASE 2; IRAK2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The interleukin-1 receptor (IL1R) signaling pathway leads to nuclear
factor kappa-B (NFKB; e.g., 164011) activation in mammals. After binding
to IL1 (e.g., 147760), the type 1 IL1R (IL1R1; 147810) associates with
the IL1R accessory protein (IL1RAP; 602626) and initiates the signaling
cascade. Multiple protein kinase activities coprecipitate with IL1R1,
including IRAK1 (300283). By searching EST databases for sequences
similar to IRAK1, Muzio et al. (1997) identified IRAK2. The deduced
protein contains 590 amino acids. Northern blot analysis detected an
approximately 4-kb IRAK2 transcript in a variety of adult human tissues.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Lin et al. (2010) reported the crystal structure of the MyD88
(602170)-IRAK4 (606883)-IRAK2 death domain complex, which revealed a
left-handed helical oligomer that consists of 6 MyD88, 4 IRAK4, and 4
IRAK2 death domains. Assembly of this helical signaling tower is
hierarchical, in which MyD88 recruits IRAK4 and the MyD88-IRAK4 complex
recruits the IRAK4 substrates IRAK2 or the related IRAK1. Formation of
these myddosome complexes brings the kinase domains of IRAKs into
proximity for phosphorylation and activation. Composite binding sites
are required for recruitment of the individual death domains in the
complex, which are confirmed by mutagenesis and previously identified
signaling mutations. Specificities of myddosome formation are dictated
by both molecular complementation and correspondence of surface
electrostatics.

GENE FUNCTION

Muzio et al. (1997) showed that ectopic expression of IRAK2 protein
induced NFKB activation, whereas expression of truncated IRAK2 proteins
did not. Truncated forms of IRAK2 acted as dominant-negative inhibitors
of IL1R-induced NFKB activity. IRAK2 coprecipitated with MYD88 (602170)
and TRAF6 (602355), another protein implicated in the IL1 signaling
pathway and shown to complex with IRAK1. Muzio et al. (1997) concluded
that IRAK2 is a proximal mediator of IL1, is a component of the IL1R
signaling complex, and is required for IL1R-induced NFKB activation.

ANIMAL MODEL

Conner et al. (2009) detected an earlier, more potent Toll-like receptor
(TLR; see 603030)-mediated induction of Il6 (147620) transcription in a
wild-derived mouse strain, MOLF/Ei, compared with the classical inbred
strain C57BL/6J. The phenotype correlated with increased activity of the
I-kappa-B kinase (see 600664) axis and p38 (MAPK14; 600289), but not
Mapk1 (176948), Mapk3 (601795), or Mapk8 (601158). The trait was mapped
to the Why1 locus, which contains Irak2, on mouse chromosome 6. Conner
et al. (2009) showed that, in the MOLF/Ei TLR signaling network, Irak2
promoted early NF-kappa-B activity and was essential for p38 activation.
In the MOLF/Ei strain, they identified a 10-bp deletion in the promoter
region of an inhibitory Irak2 variant, Irak2c, leading to an increased
ratio of pro- to antiinflammatory Irak2 isoforms. Conner et al. (2009)
concluded that Irak2 is an essential component of the early TLR response
in wild-derived MOLF/Ei mice and that the pathway of p38 and NF-kappa-B
activation is distinct in this organism.

608258	TITLE *608258 DIPEPTIDYL PEPTIDASE IX; DPP9
;;DIPEPTIDYL PEPTIDASE IV-RELATED PROTEIN 2; DPRP2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to the catalytic
domain of DPP4 (102720), followed by PCR and 5-prime RACE of skeletal
muscle and chronic myelogenous leukemia (K-562) cell line cDNA
libraries, Olsen and Wagtmann (2002) cloned DPP9. The deduced 863-amino
acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of about 98 kD. An
alternatively spliced transcript cloned from the K-562 cell line cDNA
library lacks exon 2 in the 5-prime untranslated region and encodes the
same deduced protein. Use of an alternate start codon would result in a
DPP9 protein with 29 more amino acids. DPP9 contains an active-site
serine protease motif (GWSYG) and 2 N-glycosylation sites. The order and
spacing of the serine, aspartic acid, and histidine residues that form
the catalytic triad in DPP9 are conserved with DPP4. DPP9 lacks an
N-terminal signal sequence and transmembrane domain. It shares 58% amino
acid identity with DPP8 (606879) and 92% identity with mouse Dpp9.
Northern blot analysis detected ubiquitous expression of a 4.4-kb
transcript. Highest expression was in skeletal muscle, heart, and liver,
and lowest expression was in brain. Western blot analysis detected
expression of DPP9 in all cell lines examined, including a
T-lymphoblastoid cell line that does not express DPP4. In vitro
translation resulted in a soluble protein with an apparent molecular
mass of 98 kD by SDS-PAGE.

By PCR, Qi et al. (2003) cloned DPP9 from a colon cDNA library. DPP9
shares 19% amino acid identity with DPP4, with the greatest similarity
in the C-terminal sequences. It shares 20% amino acid identity with
DPP10 (608209). Northern blot analysis revealed ubiquitous expression of
a 4.5-kb transcript, with highest expression in liver and muscle.
Transcripts of 5.0 and 1.4 kb were also found in liver. Western blot
analysis detected recombinant DPP9 expressed as a cytosolic protein of
100 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

By biochemical analysis using several synthetic peptides, Qi et al.
(2003) determined that DPP9 and DPP8 showed prolyl oligopeptidase
activity similar to that displayed by DPP4. Maximum activity was
measured between pH 7.5 and 8.5. Activity was inhibited by broad serine
protease inhibitors, but not by aprotinin, which is specific for
trypsin-like serine proteases.

GENE STRUCTURE

Olsen and Wagtmann (2002) determined that the DPP9 gene contains 22
exons and spans 48.7 kb. The promoter region has features typical for
promoters of housekeeping genes, namely a high GC content, multiple
sites for initiation of transcription, and lack of a TATAA box.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Olsen and Wagtmann (2002) mapped the DPP9
gene to chromosome 19p13.3. They mapped the mouse Dpp9 gene to a region
of mouse chromosome 17 that shows homology of synteny with human
chromosome 19p13.3.

400008	TITLE *400008 PROTEIN KINASE, Y-LINKED; PRKY
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

PRKX (300083) is a novel serine/threonine subtype of protein kinase that
appears to encode a protein related to the catalytic subunit of the
cAMP-dependent protein kinases, which are key players in the cellular
responses to the second messenger cAMP. Klink et al. (1995) found that
somatic cell hybrid analysis of PRKX under high stringency conditions
revealed at least 3 further loci closely related to this gene in the
human, constituting a small subfamily.

Schiebel et al. (1997) isolated and characterized the PRKY gene, which
is highly homologous to the PRKX gene on Xp22.3 and represents a member
of the cAMP-dependent serine/threonine protein kinase gene family.

MAPPING

Schiebel et al. (1997) used FISH analysis to map the PRKY gene to Yp11.2
in close proximity to AMELY (410000); the autosomal copy, a pseudogene
(PRKXP1), to 15q26; and a further X-linked pseudogene (PRKXP2) to
Xq12-q13.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Abnormal interchange can occur anywhere between Xp and Yp proximal to
SRY (480000). Schiebel et al. (1997) demonstrated that abnormal
interchange in XX males (400045) and XY females (400044) happens
particularly frequently between PRKX and PRKY. In a collection of 26 XX
males and 4 XY females, between 27 and 35% of the interchanges took
place between PRK homologs, but at different sites within the gene. PRKY
and PRKX are located far from the pseudoautosomal region, where XY
exchange normally takes place. Schiebel et al. (1997) stated that the
unprecedented high sequence identity and identical orientation of PRKY
to its homologous partner on the X chromosome, PRKX, explains the high
frequency of abnormal pairing and the subsequent ectopic recombination,
leading to XX males and XY females and to the highest rate of
recombination outside the pseudoautosomal region.

Using a combination of STS deletion mapping, binary marker and Y-short
tandem repeat haplotyping, and TSPY (480100) copy number estimation,
Jobling et al. (2007) identified 4 distinct classes of deletions
affecting chromosome Yp in 45 males from 12 different populations. The
most common deletion class was found in 41 Y chromosomes (91%) and
appeared to be caused by nonallelic homologous recombination between the
major TSPY repeat array and a single telomeric copy of the TSPY gene
located over 3 Mb from the array. This deletion resulted in loss of the
AMELY, TBL1Y (400033), and PRKY genes, which lie in the region
separating the single TSPY gene and the TSPY repeat array, as well as
reduced TSPY copy number. The rarer deletion classes did not involve the
major TSPY repeat array, but resulted in loss of the more telomeric
PCDH11Y gene (400022) in addition to AMELY, TBL1Y, PRKY, and the single
telomeric TSPY copy. The persistence and expansion of deletion lineages,
together with phenotypic evidence, suggested that absence of these genes
has no major deleterious effects.

610405	TITLE *610405 CHONDROITIN POLYMERIZING FACTOR; CHPF
;;CHONDROITIN SULFATE SYNTHASE 2; CSS2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database searching with the sequence of CHSY1 (608183) as probe,
Kitagawa et al. (2003) isolated CHPF. The deduced 775-amino acid protein
has a predicted molecular mass of approximately 85 kD and contains 3
potential N-glycosylation sites. CHPF has a prominent N-terminal
hydrophobic segment and is predicted to be a type II transmembrane
protein. CHPF shares 57% and 23% sequence identity with chondroitin
sulfate glucuronyltransferase (CSGlcAT; 608037) and CHSY1, respectively.
Northern blot analysis detected a 3.4-kb CHPF transcript in all tissues
examined except peripheral blood leukocytes; CHPF expression was
detected at high levels in placenta and heart and at moderate levels in
brain, skeletal muscle, kidney, and liver.

Yada et al. (2003) independently isolated CHPF, which they called CSS2,
by database searching with the sequence of CSGlcAT as probe. Although
Kitagawa et al. (2003) stated that CHPF lacks the conserved DXD motif
found in most glycosyltransferases, Yada et al. (2003) identified a DXD
motif and another motif conserved in beta-1,3-glycosyltransferases in
the N terminus of the protein. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis
detected CHPF expression in all tissues examined, with highest
expression in pancreas, ovary, placenta, small intestine, and stomach.

GENE FUNCTION

Kitagawa et al. (2003) found that the expression of a soluble
recombinant form of CHPF in COS-1 cells produced a protein with little
glucuronyltransferase (GlcAT-II) or N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase
(GalNAcT-II) activities responsible for the biosynthesis of repeating
disaccharide units of chondroitin sulfate. However, coexpression of CHPF
and CHSY1 yielded markedly augmented glycosyltransferase activity,
whereas simple mixing of the 2 separately expressed proteins did not.
When both GlcUA and GalNAc were used as sugar donors, chondroitin
polymerization was demonstrated on the so-called
glycosaminoglycan-protein linkage region tetrasaccharide sequence of
alpha-thrombomodulin. Kitagawa et al. (2003) concluded that the
chondroitin polymerizing activity requires concomitant expression of
CHPF with CHSY1.

In experiments with a soluble recombinant form of CHPF in COS-7 cells,
Yada et al. (2003) found that CHPF displayed dual GlcAT-II and
GalNAcT-II glycosyltransferase activities. They concluded that CHPF
plays a role in chondroitin sulfate chain synthesis.

GENE STRUCTURE

The CHPF gene contains at least 4 exons and spans over 5 kb (Kitagawa et
al., 2003; Yada et al., 2003).

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Kitagawa et al. (2003) mapped the CHPF gene to
chromosome 2q35-q36. By the same method, Yada et al. (2003) mapped the
gene to 2q36.1.

300394	TITLE *300394 TAFAZZIN; TAZ
;;G4.5
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Cardiolipin is a complex glycerophospholipid with 4 acyl groups that
localizes to the mitochondrial inner membrane and has a role in
mitochondrial structure and function. TAZ is a mitochondrial
transacylase that catalyzes remodeling of immature cardiolipin to its
mature composition containing a predominance of tetralinoleoyl moieties
(Acehan et al., 2011).

CLONING

Bione et al. (1996) identified a gene that is located in the gene-rich
region Xq28 where Barth syndrome (302060) maps. The gene, which they
termed G4.5, was expressed at high levels in cardiac and skeletal
muscle. Different mRNAs were produced by alternative splicing of the
primary G4.5 transcript, encoding proteins that differed at their N
terminus and in the central region. These proteins, which Bione et al.
(1996) termed tafazzins, have no known similarities to other proteins.
The longest encoded protein contains 292 amino acids. Two regions of the
proteins may be functionally significant. The highly hydrophobic stretch
of 30 residues at the N terminus may serve as a membrane anchor. The
shortest forms of tafazzins (lacking the first 2 exons) do not have any
hydrophobic sequence at the N terminus and may be soluble cytoplasmic
proteins. The second variable region is the central portion between
amino acids 124 and 195. Removal of exons 5, 6, and 7 would
progressively shorten a hydrophilic domain of the protein, which may
serve as an exposed loop interacting with other proteins. Accordingly,
the 2 most abundant forms differ in the sequence encoded in exon 5,
which is also the longest and most hydrophilic. RT-PCR revealed
tissue-specific expression of several TAZ variants in leukocytes,
fibroblasts, heart, and skeletal muscle.

GENE STRUCTURE

Bione et al. (1996) determined that the TAZ gene contains 11 exons and
that its 5-prime end maps to a CpG island.

MAPPING

By positional cloning, Bione et al. (1996) identified the TAZ gene
within the critical Barth syndrome region on Xq28.

GENE FUNCTION

Claypool et al. (2006) showed that yeast Taz localized to both the inner
and outer mitochondrial membranes via an 18-amino acid integral
interfacial membrane anchor that integrated into, but not through, the
lipid bilayers. Several residues within this domain are either conserved
or identical in mouse and human TAZ. Mutation of conserved residues
within the interfacial membrane anchor of yeast Taz altered its membrane
association by either mistargeting the protein to the mitochondrial
matrix or altering its assembly within the mitochondrial membrane.

Sessions et al. (2009) identified insect host factors required for
dengue virus (see 614371) propagation by carrying out a genomewide RNA
interference screen in D. melanogaster cells using a well established
22,632 double-stranded RNA library. This screen identified 116 candidate
dengue virus host factors (DVHFs). Although some were previously
associated with flaviviruses, most of the DVHFs were newly implicated in
dengue virus propagation. The dipteran DVHFs had 82 readily recognizable
human homologs and, using a targeted short interfering RNA screen, they
showed that 42 of these are human DVHFs. These include NPR2 (108961),
SEC61B (609214), TMEM214, TAZ, EXDL2, and CNOT2 (604909). Sessions et
al. (2009) concluded that this overlap indicates notable conservation of
required factors between dipteran and human hosts.

Houtkooper et al. (2009) provided an overview of current knowledge on
the role of tafazzin in cardiolipin metabolism. In addition, they
performed quantitative PCR analysis of different tafazzin mRNA splice
variants in human tissues and correlated this with the tissue
cardiolipin profile. The data suggested that tafazzin lacking exon 5
most likely represents the active tafazzin variant, but the involvement
of other variants in cardiolipin remodeling was not excluded.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In patients with Barth syndrome (302060), Bione et al. (1996) identified
mutations in the tafazzin gene which introduced stop codons in the open
reading frame, aborting translation of most of the putative proteins.
Using mutation analysis on DNA samples from members of 4 families with
Barth syndrome, 2 large families used by Ades et al. (1993) and Bolhuis
et al. (1991) for linkage mapping of the gene and 2 smaller families
with the diagnostic features of the disease, Bione et al. (1996) found
unique mutations in all patients. In 1 case the mutation was in exon 7
(300394.0004), one of the alternative exons. The mutation was predicted
to cause truncation of most of the tafazzin proteins, but some minor
forms lacking exon 7 could still be synthesized. The other 3 mutations
(300394.0001, 300394.0002, and 300394.0003) were in the second exon and
in the 3-prime splice junction of intron 2.

D'Adamo et al. (1997) analyzed the G4.5 gene in 8 additional probands
with Barth syndrome and identified mutations in 6 of them (see, e.g.,
300394.0006). In addition, in affected individuals from 3 families who
had been diagnosed with X-linked infantile cardiomyopathy and/or
endocardial fibroelastosis, D'Adamo et al. (1997) identified a 1-bp
deletion and a missense mutation in the G4.5 gene (300394.0005 and
300394.0014, respectively). D'Adamo et al. (1997) noted that the
clinical data on these patients was limited and whether other features
of Barth syndrome were present could not be established; they suggested
that mutations in the G4.5 gene should be considered as a possible cause
of infantile CMD affecting males, even in the absence of typical Barth
syndrome signs.

Bleyl et al. (1997) screened the G4.5 gene for mutations in a family
with noncompaction of left ventricular myocardium (LVNCX, see 302060) by
SSCP and direct sequencing and found a novel glycine-to-arginine
substitution at position 197 of the tafazzin gene (300394.0006).

Johnston et al. (1997) evaluated 14 Barth syndrome pedigrees and found
mutations in the G4.5 gene in all, 5 missense mutations (see, e.g.,
300394.0006), 4 splice site mutations (see, e.g., 300394.0007), 3
deletions, 1 insertion, and 1 nonsense mutation. Nine of the 14
mutations were predicted to disrupt significantly the protein products
of G4.5. The occurrence of missense mutations in exons 3 and 8 suggested
that these exons encode essential portions of the G4.5 proteins.

In affected individuals and obligate carriers from 5 unrelated families
with Barth syndrome that presented to a hospital in Bristol, England,
over a 7-year period, Cantlay et al. (1999) identified mutations in the
G4.5 gene (see, e.g., 300394.0006). The authors suggested that Barth
syndrome may be more common than previously believed, and concluded that
all young male children with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy should be
investigated for underlying Barth syndrome.

Chen et al. (2002) analyzed the G4.5 gene in 27 Japanese patients with
left ventricular noncompaction, including 14 familial cases from 10
families and 13 sporadic cases, and identified a splice site mutation in
1 family (300394.0013). Review of the G4.5 mutations identified to date
in 38 reported cases of Barth syndrome and other cardiomyopathies
revealed no correlation between location or type of mutation and either
cardiac phenotype or disease severity.

ANIMAL MODEL

Xu et al. (2006) generated homozygous Drosophila mutants that were
unable to express full-length tafazzin and observed an 80% reduction of
cardiolipin with diversification of its molecular composition, similar
to the changes seen in Barth syndrome patients. Other phospholipids were
not affected. Flies with the tafazzin mutation showed reduced locomotor
activity, and their indirect flight muscles displayed frequent
mitochondrial abnormalities, mostly in the cristae membranes. Xu et al.
(2006) concluded that a lack of full-length tafazzin is responsible for
cardiolipin deficiency, which is integral to the disease mechanism and
leads to mitochondrial myopathy.

Using inducible short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs), Acehan et al. (2011)
targeted Taz knockdown in mice beginning in early embryos. Taz knockdown
induced a dramatic decrease in tetralinoleoyl cardiolipin content, with
a concomitant shift toward more saturated cardiolipin species and
accumulation of monolysocardiolipins. Ultrastructural abnormalities
became evident in skeletal muscle by 2 months of age and in cardiac
muscle by 8 months of age. No abnormalities were observed in other
tissues. Mitochondrial abnormalities included disruption of
mitochondrial architecture with proliferation, vacuolization, and signs
of mitophagy. Affected muscle also showed myofibrillar disarray and
dilation of mitochondrion- and endoplasmic reticulum-associated
vesicles. Taz knockdown led to impaired cardiac function, with dilation
and loss of muscle mass in left ventricle and reduced fractional
shortening and ejection fraction. Acehan et al. (2011) concluded that
continuous cardiolipin deficiency has a progressive and cumulative
effect on mitochondrial structures in sarcomeric tissues.

Independently, Soustek et al. (2011) knocked down Taz expression in mice
using inducible shRNAs and reported findings similar to those of Acehan
et al. (2011). Soustek et al. (2011) found reduced isometric contractile
strength in Taz-knockdown soleus muscle at 2 months of age.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
BARTH SYNDROME
TAZ, IVS2, G-A, -1

In patient GW with Barth syndrome (302060), Bione et al. (1996)
demonstrated a G-to-A transition at position -1 at the 3-prime end of
intron 2 of the Barth syndrome gene (nucleotide position 527-1 of their
cDNA). As a G is the base immediately 3-prime to the mutation (in exon
3), the AG splice site was reconstituted, with a 1-bp shift.
Consequently, RT-PCR analysis showed a normal-sized band. Direct
sequencing of the gel-purified band, however, demonstrated a 1-base
deletion in cDNA, which introduced a stop codon 3 residues after the
splice junction. See also 302060.0003.

.0002
BARTH SYNDROME
TAZ, TYR51TER

In the family with Barth syndrome (302060) first reported by Barth et
al. (1983), Bolhuis et al. (1991) demonstrated linkage to Xq28. In
affected members of the family, Bione et al. (1996) identified a C-to-G
transversion at nucleotide position 441 of their cDNA, resulting in a
tyr51-to-ter (Y51X) substitution. The mutation was located in the second
exon. Barth et al. (2004) provided an update on the pedigree.

.0003
BARTH SYNDROME
TAZ, IVS2, G-C, -1

In patient K with Barth syndrome (302060), Bione et al. (1996)
demonstrated a G-to-C transversion in the last nucleotide of intron 2
(cDNA nucleotide 527-1). Thus, this mutation has, as in patient GW
(302060.0001), affected the 3-prime splice signal.

.0004
BARTH SYNDROME
TAZ, 1-BP INS

In patient OAT with Barth syndrome (302060), previously reported by Ades
et al. (1993), Bione et al. (1996) identified a 1-bp insertion in exon
7, after cDNA nucleotide 868, introducing a frameshift and stop codon
after 201 amino acids.

.0005
BARTH SYNDROME
TAZ, 1-BP DEL

In affected members of a large Australian family in which males died in
early infancy from congenital dilated cardiomyopathy (302060),
originally reported by Gedeon et al. (1995), D'Adamo et al. (1997)
identified a 1-bp deletion in exon 8 of the G4.5 gene, causing a
frameshift and resulting in a stop codon after 18 nucleotides. The
mutation caused knockout of all the putative tafazzins. The severe
clinical manifestations of the disorder (described in 6 affected males
and in 8 males suspected of being affected) could thus be related to the
severity of the mutation.

.0006
BARTH SYNDROME
TAZ, GLY197ARG

In a Utah family, Bleyl et al. (1997) observed 6 males with neonatal
onset of left ventricular failure and arrhythmias associated with the
pathognomonic echocardiographic findings of isolated left ventricular
noncompaction (LVNC). Neutropenia was seen in 2 patients, and another
patient had muscle weakness. Genetic linkage analysis localized the
causative gene to Xq28. Bleyl et al. (1997) screened the G4.5 gene with
SSCP and direct sequencing revealed a G-A transition in exon 8,
resulting in a gly197-to-arg (G197R) substitution at a highly conserved
residue. The mutation segregated with LVNC in the family and was not
found in 300 unrelated females.

In a male infant who died of Barth syndrome (BTHS; 302060) at 14 months
of age, D'Adamo et al. (1997) identified the G197R mutation in the G4.5
gene. The patient exhibited dilated cardiomyopathy, neutropenia, and
3-methylglutaconic aciduria.

In a boy with Barth syndrome, previously studied at 6.5 years of age by
Christodoulou et al. (1994), Johnston et al. (1997) identified the
877G-A transition exon 8 of the G4.5 gene, resulting in the G197R
substitution. The patient presented at 3 months of age with congestive
heart failure, and had recurrent episodes of neutropenia. At 6.5 years
of age, his height, weight, and head circumference were all below the
third centile, and he had a myopathic facial appearance and a nasal
quality to his speech. Echocardiography showed moderate cardiac
enlargement with left ventricular dilation but no outflow obstruction.
Muscle bulk, power, and tone were decreased and he had a waddling gait.

In 2 families with Barth syndrome, Cantlay et al. (1999) identified the
G197R mutation in the G4.5 gene. One family presented a history of 5
boys over 2 generations who died from cardiomyopathy between 4 to 6
months of age. The mutation was detected in the proband's unaffected
sister, mother, and a maternal aunt. In the other family, the proband
presented at 6 months of age with dilated cardiomyopathy and was found
to have failure to thrive, skeletal myopathy, intermittent neutropenia
and elevated urinary 3-methylglutaconic acid. He underwent cardiac
transplantation at 11 months of age, and died at age 7 years of T-cell
non-Hodgkin lymphoma. His mother and maternal grandmother also carried
the mutation. Steward et al. (2010) studied a distant branch of the
latter family, in which a known carrier of the G197R mutation gave birth
to a male infant who died at 1 week of age due to cardiac decompensation
triggered by ventricular arrhythmias. Disease expression in this family
was variable: a cousin with BTHS was well until he fell behind on motor
milestones at 1 year of age, developed feeding problems and lethargy at
2.5 years, was diagnosed with CMD at 3.5 years, and required cardiac
transplantation several months later. Another cousin was only diagnosed
with BTHS after the disease was identified in his younger brother, who
developed CMD at 3 months of age, without neutropenia; when diagnosed at
3.5 years of age, the older brother's only sign was proximal myopathy.

In 2 brothers with Barth syndrome and their affected cousin, and another
unrelated BTHS patient, Hastings et al. (2009) identified the G197R
mutation in the TAZ gene. The 4 patients exhibited a characteristic
facial appearance that was most evident in infancy and included a tall
and broad forehead, round face with prominent chin and full cheeks,
large ears, and deep-set eyes.

.0007
BARTH SYNDROME
TAZ, IVS1, G-C, +5

In the proband from pedigree 2 of Kelley et al. (1991) with Barth
syndrome (302060), Johnston et al. (1997) demonstrated a G-to-C
transversion at nucleotide 5 in intron 1 of the G4.5 gene. The mutation
disrupted proper processing of the transcript. The proband presented
with congestive heart failure at 4 months of age, and was found to have
biventricular dilated hypertrophy. Electromyography showed changes
consistent with myopathy, and metabolic studies showed mild lactic
acidosis and increased urinary levels of lactate, fumarate,
3-methylglutarate, and 3-methylglutaconate. At 2 years of age, he had a
low absolute neutrophil count, but had no unusual bacterial infections.
Cognitive development was normal, whereas growth was below the third
percentile, and proximal and distal muscle weakness persisted. The
proband had 2 maternal uncles who had died of 'massive cardiac
enlargement' at 8 months and 11 months of age, respectively, and a third
uncle had hypotonia, weakness, exercise intolerance, and impaired growth
during childhood and early adolescence.

.0008
BARTH SYNDROME
TAZ, IVS3, G-A, +110

Sakamoto et al. (2001) found an unusual intronic mutation of the TAZ
gene in a Japanese patient with Barth syndrome (302060). The patient's
development was delayed and at the age of 4 years cardiomyopathy was
diagnosed. At age 9 years, his neutrophil count was abnormally low.
Electrocardiographic changes consisted of ST-T wave depressions.
Increased urinary excretion of 3-methylglutaconic acid, 3-methylglutaric
acid, and ethylhydracrylic acid was found. Death occurred suddenly at
the age of 10 years. RT-PCR showed aberrant splicing and elongation of
exon 3 because of insertion of 106 bases between exons 3 and 4. Genomic
DNA showed an intronic mutation 4 bases downstream from the new cleavage
site. The mutation, IVS3+110G-A, created a novel 5-prime splice site
that showed GC but not GT, and the additional splice site was used
preferentially over the upstream authentic splice site.

.0009
BARTH SYNDROME
TAZ, CYS118ARG

In a 5-month-old male infant with ventricular noncompaction associated
with a dilated, mildly hypertrophic heart, with poor systolic function
on echocardiogram and clinical heart failure, who also had neutropenia
and 3-methylglutaconic aciduria (302060), Ichida et al. (2001)
identified a 352T-C transition in the TAZ gene, resulting in a
cys118-to-arg (C118R) substitution. The unaffected mother was
heterozygous for the same mutation.

.0010
BARTH SYNDROME
TAZ, IVS1, A-G, -2

Ichida et al. (2001) identified a splice acceptor site mutation in exon
2 of the TAZ gene (398-2A-G) resulting in phenotypes ranging from
classic Barth syndrome (302060) to fatal infantile dilated
cardiomyopathy to late-onset symptomatic and asymptomatic dilated
cardiomyopathy. Six males in 5 separate sibships related as first
cousins and connected through carrier females were affected in this
family.

.0011
BARTH SYNDROME
TAZ, ARG94SER

In a Japanese BTHS (302060) patient with cardiomyopathy associated with
abnormal mitochondria, cyclic neutropenia, and 3-methylglutaconic
aciduria, Sakamoto et al. (2002) identified a novel missense mutation,
arg94 to ser (R94S), in the TAZ gene.

.0012
BARTH SYNDROME
TAZ, 4-BP DEL, AGTG

In a 12-year-old boy with Barth syndrome (302060), Marziliano et al.
(2007) identified a 4-bp deletion in exon 8 of the TAZ gene inherited
from his unaffected mother. The boy had left ventricular noncompaction
and dilated cardiomyopathy, which was detected at 3 months, skeletal
myopathy, recurrent oral aphthous ulcers, and cyclic neutropenia. Left
ventricular function progressively improved since age 5 years and became
subclinical and normal; he presented at age 11 with recurrent ulcers and
signs of myopathy. A peripheral blood sample from the patient showed TAZ
expression that was not significantly lower compared to controls, but
myocardial TAZ expression in an endomyocardial biopsy performed on the
proband at 6 months of age was significantly lower compared to
age-matched controls. TAZ expression declined with age in controls as
well, suggesting that tafazzin is essential during fetal and early
postnatal life. The proband also carried a heterozygous mutation in the
LDB3 gene (605906), which is associated with left ventricular
noncompaction. The patient's father and brother also carried the LDB3
mutation and had evidence of left ventricular trabeculation without
dysfunction. The significance of the LDB3 mutation was unclear.

.0013
BARTH SYNDROME
TAZ, IVS8AS, G-C, -1

In a large Japanese family with a history of unexplained male infant
deaths over 4 generations, in which the proband and a distant male
relative presented at 2 months and 3 months of age, respectively, with
heart failure and left ventricular noncompaction (302060), Chen et al.
(2002) identified a -1G-C transversion in IVS8 of the TAZ gene. RT-PCR
analysis of RNA from a heterozygous carrier confirmed that the mutation
abolishes splicing at the intron 8 splice acceptor sequence, resulting
in skipping of exon 9. The mutation was not found in 100 Japanese or 100
Caucasian controls.

.0014
BARTH SYNDROME
TAZ, GLY240ARG

In 2 unrelated families in which multiple males had died in infancy with
dilated cardiomyopathy (302060), D'Adamo et al. (1997) identified a
1006G-A transition in exon 10 of the TAZ gene, resulting in a
gly240-to-arg (G240R) substitution. In 1 of the families, which had
originally been reported by Lindenbaum et al. (1973) as having
endocardial fibroelastosis, the G240R mutation was detected in 3
obligate carriers. In the other family, in which 3 affected males had
died of cardiac failure in infancy and were diagnosed with endocardial
fibroelastosis at autopsy, the mutation was detected in all affected
individuals and in the proband's mother. The mutation was not found in
100 normal chromosomes.

602378	TITLE *602378 DYNAMIN 2; DNM2
;;DYN2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Dynamins (DNMs) are members of a group of GTPases that share high
homology in their N-terminal regions. Mammals have at least 3 DNMs: DNM1
(602377), DNM2, and DNM3 (611445). Diatloff-Zito et al. (1995) had
previously isolated a human genomic DNA fragment by its capacity to
correct the mitomycin C hypersensitivity of cells from a Fanconi anemia
patient belonging to genetic complementation group D (FACD; 227646).
Using this fragment, they screened a human fibroblast cDNA library and
isolated a cDNA encoding DNM2. The predicted 866-amino acid protein is
73% and 98% identical to DNM1 and rat Dnm2, respectively. It contains
the 3 consensus sequence elements characteristic of GTP-binding proteins
at its N terminus, a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, and a basic,
proline-rich C-terminal region that contains multiple SRC homology 3
domains. DNM2 contains 9 consensus motifs for CDC2 (116940)
phosphorylation, indicating a potential role at the G2/mitosis
transition. Northern blot analysis detected a 3.6-kb transcript in all
tissues examined, with highest expression in heart and skeletal muscle.
Sequencing and RT-PCR identified alternative splicing variants of DNM2.
The authors suggested that multiple rounds of duplication and divergence
occurred within DNM gene evolution. No alterations in DNM2 sequence or
mRNA expression were detected in the FACD patient studied.

By in situ hybridization with a Dnm2 mRNA probe, Koutsopoulos et al.
(2013) found Dnm2 expression in most mouse embryonic tissues, including
the peripheral nervous system, but not in skeletal muscle or heart.

GENE FUNCTION

Gomez et al. (2005) found that DYN2 accumulated at the T cell-antigen
presenting cell (APC) interface in the presence of antigen. DYN2
knockdown experiments showed that DYN2 coupled T-cell receptor
(TCR)-mediated signaling pathways to those regulating IL2 (147680)
promoter activity and CD69 (107273) expression. Further experiments
identified DYN2 as a critical regulator of the actin cytoskeleton in
response to TCR engagement. The proline-rich domain of DYN2 interacted
directly with the SH3 domain of VAV1 (164875), and this interaction was
required for T-cell activation. Gomez et al. (2005) concluded that DYN2
regulates actin reorganization at the immunologic synapse and links to
VAV1 and its downstream signaling pathways after TCR engagement.

Orth and McNiven (2003) found that Dyn2 associated with amphiphysin
(600418) on phagosomes in cultured cells. Expression of a
GTPase-deficient Dyn2 mutant prevented vesiculation and induced the
formation of long plasma membrane invaginations coated with the mutant
protein and terminated with a clathrin (see 118955) tip or bulb.

In studies in cultured mouse podocytes and rodent models of proteinuria,
Sever et al. (2007) showed that during proteinuric kidney disease,
induction of cytoplasmic cathepsin L (CTSL; 116880) led to cleavage of
dynamin at a conserved site between amino acids 354 and 359, resulting
in reorganization of the podocyte actin cytoskeleton and proteinuria.
Dynamin mutants that lacked the CTSL site, or rendered the CTSL site
inaccessible through dynamin self-assembly, were resistant to CTSL
cleavage. When delivered into mice, these mutants restored podocyte
function and resolved proteinuria. Sever et al. (2007) concluded that
dynamin is a critical regulator of renal permselectivity that is
specifically targeted by proteolysis under pathologic conditions.

GENE STRUCTURE

Zuchner et al. (2005) determined that the DNM2 gene contains 22 exons,
20 of which are coding.

MAPPING

By interspecific backcross analysis, Klocke et al. (1997) found that the
mouse Dnm2 gene is closely linked to the Icam1 gene (147840) on the
proximal portion of chromosome 9, in a region with homologies to human
19p, 8q, and 11q. That the human ICAM1 gene is located on 19p13.3-p13.2
is evidence that the DNM2 gene is also in that region. The finding of
mutations in the DNM2 gene in families with a form of dominant
intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (606482) that maps to
19p13.2-p12 is further confirmation of the mapping of DNM2 to chromosome
19.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Because the DNM2 gene maps to 19p13.2-p12 and shares domains similar to
those of genes known to be involved in axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth
disease (see 118210), Zuchner et al. (2005) considered it a candidate
gene for the form of dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease
that maps to chromosome 19p13.2-p12 (DI-CMTB; 606482). They identified 3
unique mutations in the DNM2 pleckstrin homology domain in 3 unrelated
families with DI-CMTB. These mutations disturbed the function of DNM2 in
a cellular model. DNM2 represented the third protein mutated in CMT that
contains a GTPase domain and is related to fusion or fission of cellular
membranes. In 2 of the families neutropenia cosegregated with the
neuropathy; these families each had a mutation affecting lys558
(602378.0002, 602378.0003), which suggested that this residue has a
function in maturation or survival of peripheral blood cells.

Bitoun et al. (2005) carried out genomewide linkage mapping analysis in
2 families with autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy (CNM1;
160150), narrowing the CNM1 locus to an 11-Mb interval on 19p13.2. The
DNM2 gene, which maps to this region, was considered a good candidate.
Sequencing of exons and intron-exon boundaries in the probands of 3
families identified heterozygous mutations. Two were located in exon 8
and involved the same arg369 residue, (R369Q, 602378.0004; R369W,
602378.0005), and 1 was in exon 11 and involved an R465W mutation
(602378.0006). Another mutation, E368K (602378.0007), was a de novo
mutation in 1 family.

Tosch et al. (2006) described a patient with centronuclear myopathy who
carried heterozygous mutations in both the DNM2 (E368K; 602378.0007) and
MTMR14 (Y462C; 611089.0002) genes. They noted that whereas centronuclear
myopathy patients with other characterized mutations in DYN2 usually
have an age of onset in childhood or adulthood, the age of onset in
their patient was neonatal. The report raised the possibility of MTMR14
being a modifier of the phenotype in some cases of centronuclear
myopathy.

Bitoun et al. (2007) identified 4 different de novo heterozygous DNM2
mutations (see, e.g., 602378.0010; 602378.0011) in 5 unrelated patients
with sporadic CNM. All mutations were in exon 16 of the DNM2 gene within
the pleckstrin homology domain. Three of the patients had a severe
disorder with onset at birth.

Using in vitro sedimentation assays, Wang et al. (2010) showed that
centronuclear myopathy-associated mutant DNM2 proteins (see, e.g.,
602378.0005-602378.0007) formed more stable dynamin polymers in the
presence of GTP compared to wildtype, presumably reflecting abnormally
strong dynamin-dynamin interactions. The mutant protein aggregates were
less sensitive to disassociation by GTP, and retained higher GTPase
activities compared to wildtype. The observations suggested that the
affected residues, such as glu368, arg369, and arg465, normally function
to prevent excessive or prolonged dynamin assembly.

- Lethal Congenital Contracture Syndrome 5

In 3 sibs, born of consanguineous Pakistani parents, with lethal
congenital contracture syndrome-5 (LCCS5; 615368), Koutsopoulos et al.
(2013) identified a homozygous missense mutation in the DNM2 gene
(F379V; 602378.0013). The infants all showed severe hypotonia with lack
of spontaneous movement and respiratory insufficiency at birth,
resulting in death in a few days to months. Each also showed retinal
hemorrhages. Studies on patient cells and in vitro functional analysis
indicated that the mutation was hypomorphic. Animal studies in mice and
zebrafish suggested a role for Dnm2 in the development of muscle fibers
and vasculature.

ANIMAL MODEL

Koutsopoulos et al. (2013) found that morpholino knockdown of Dnm2 in
zebrafish embryos resulted in lethality in 10% and bent tails in 20%.
Morphant muscle fibers showed mild misalignment of muscle fibers;
muscular innervation appeared normal. There were also defects in the
endothelium of the vascular system. The findings suggested that Dnm2 has
a pleiotropic role during development.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, DOMINANT INTERMEDIATE B
DNM2, 9-BP DEL, NT1652

In a North American family with dominant intermediate
Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (606482), Zuchner et al. (2005) found a 9-bp
deletion of the 3-prime end of exon 14 of the DNM2 gene
(1652_1659+1delATGAGGAGg). The mutation was predicted to result in 2
alternative mRNA products, one with a premature stop codon resulting
from a shift of the open reading frame (D550fs) and the other an
in-frame mRNA with a predicted deletion of 3 amino acids (D551_E553del)
produced by disruption of the original 3-prime splice site and use of a
newly introduced splice site with higher predicted splicing activity.

.0002
CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, DOMINANT INTERMEDIATE B, WITH NEUTROPENIA
DNM2, LYS558GLU

In an Australian family with dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth
disease (606482), Zuchner et al. (2005) found that affected individuals
carried a mutation in exon 15 of the DNM2 gene, 1672A-G, resulting in
the amino acid substitution lys558-to-glu (K558E). Subclinically low
counts of neutrophils and, in some affected individuals, few
lymphocytes, erythrocytes, and platelets cosegregated with CMT.

.0003
CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, DOMINANT INTERMEDIATE B, WITH NEUTROPENIA
DNM2, LYS558 DEL

In a Belgian family with dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth
disease and associated neutropenia (606482), Zuchner et al. (2005)
identified a deletion of nucleotides 1672 through 1674 (1672_1674delAAG)
in the DNM2 gene, resulting in deletion of a single amino acid, lys558.
That an abnormality of lys558 was found in 2 families (see also
602378.0002) in which neutropenia, not a general feature of dominant
intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, cosegregated with the
neuropathy implied that this residue has a function in maturation or
survival of peripheral blood cells. Congenital neutropenia (202700) is
caused by mutations in the gene elastase-2 gene (ELA2; 130130), which
maps to 19p13.3. In the Belgian family, Zuchner et al. (2005) excluded
mutations in ELA2 as the cause of neutropenia by sequence analysis of
all coding exons.

In a follow-up of the Belgian family reported by Zuchner et al. (2005),
Claeys et al. (2009) found that 1 mutation carrier had neutropenia and
cataracts without signs of a neuropathy. In addition, 5 members of this
family had early-onset cataracts in their teenage years.

.0004
MYOPATHY, CENTRONUCLEAR, 1
DNM2, ARG369GLN

In a family from French Guyana, Bitoun et al. (2005) found that 14
members with autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy (160150) carried
an 1106G-A mutation in exon 8 of the DNM2 gene, resulting in the amino
acid substitution arg369-to-gln (R369Q).

.0005
MYOPATHY, CENTRONUCLEAR, 1
DNM2, ARG369TRP

In a French family with autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy
(160150), Bitoun et al. (2005) found an 1105C-to-T transition in exon 8
of the DNM2 gene that resulted in an arg369-to-trp (R369W) amino acid
substitution.

.0006
MYOPATHY, CENTRONUCLEAR, 1
DNM2, ARG465TRP

In a French family with autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy
(160150), Bitoun et al. (2005) found an arg465-to-trp (R465W) mutation,
caused by 1393C-T transition in exon 11 of the DNM2 gene. This mutation
was found in 5 additional families, 2 Belgian, 1 German, 1 from Great
Britain, and 1 from the United States.

.0007
MYOPATHY, CENTRONUCLEAR, 1
DNM2, GLU368LYS

In a French proband with centronuclear myopathy (160150), Bitoun et al.
(2005) found an 1102G-to-A transition in exon 8 of the DNM2 gene that
resulted in a glu368-to-lys amino acid substitution (E368K). The
mutation occurred de novo.

Tosch et al. (2006) reported this mutation in heterozygosity in a
36-year-old woman with centronuclear myopathy who presented with
neonatal hypotonia, muscle weakness, and ophthalmoparesis. She also
carried a heterozygous missense mutation in the myotubularin-related
protein-14 gene (MTMR14; 611089.0002). Both mutations occurred de novo.
The report raised the possibility of MTMR14 being a modifier of the
phenotype in some cases of centronuclear myopathy.

.0008
CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, AXONAL, TYPE 2M
DNM2, GLY533CYS

In affected members of a family with autosomal dominant CMT2M (see
606482), Fabrizi et al. (2007) identified a heterozygous 1597G-T
transversion in the DNM2 gene, resulting in a gly533-to-cys (G533C)
substitution. The phenotype was milder than that reported for other CMT
patients with DNM2 mutations and was more consistent with an axonal form
of CMT.

.0009
CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, AXONAL, TYPE 2M
DNM2, LEU566HIS

In a 45-year-old proband of a family with autosomal dominant CMT2M (see
606482), Fabrizi et al. (2007) identified a heterozygous 1697T-A
transversion in the DNM2 gene, resulting in a leu566-to-his (L566H)
substitution. The phenotype was milder than that reported for other CMT
patients with DNM2 mutations and was more consistent with an axonal form
of CMT.

.0010
MYOPATHY, CENTRONUCLEAR, 1
DNM2, SER619LEU

In 2 unrelated patients with sporadic centronuclear myopathy (160150),
Bitoun et al. (2007) identified a de novo heterozygous 1856C-T
transition in exon 16 of the DNM2 gene, resulting in a ser619-to-leu
(S619L) substitution within the pleckstrin homology domain. Both
patients had a severe phenotype, with onset at birth necessitating
ventilation and nasogastric feeding, and delayed motor development.
Another unrelated patient with a milder phenotype had a different
heterozygous mutation in the same codon (S619W; 602378.0011).

.0011
MYOPATHY, CENTRONUCLEAR, 1
DNM2, SER619TRP

In a patient with sporadic centronuclear myopathy (160150), Bitoun et
al. (2007) identified a de novo heterozygous 1856C-G transversion in
exon 16 of the DNM2 gene, resulting in a ser619-to-trp (S619W)
substitution. Two other unrelated patients with a more severe phenotype
had a different heterozygous mutation in the same codon (S619L;
602378.0010).

.0012
CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, AXONAL, TYPE 2M
DNM2, GLY358ARG

In a mother and her 2 adult daughters with autosomal dominant CMT2M (see
606482), Gallardo et al. (2008) identified a heterozygous 1072G-A
transition in exon 7 of the DNM2 gene, resulting in a gly358-to-arg
(G358R) substitution in a highly conserved region in the middle domain.
The patients were ages 55, 32, and 23, and motor nerve conduction
velocities were 33, 46, and 50 m/s, respectively. All had progressive
gait unsteadiness and foot deformities, including pes cavus and toe
clawing, in the first decade of life. All had distal muscle weakness and
atrophy of the lower limbs, and the mother also had hand weakness and
atrophy. Ankle reflexes were absent in all 3, and all had hypoesthesia
of the lower limbs. MRI studies showed fatty infiltration of the calf
muscles, particularly in the anterior compartment. The fatty
infiltration increased distally and was massive in the foot musculature.
Muscle edema was also present in affected muscles. In a follow-up of the
family reported by Gallardo et al. (2008), Claeys et al. (2009) stated
that the phenotype was consistent with axonal CMT2.

.0013
LETHAL CONGENITAL CONTRACTURE SYNDROME 5 (1 family)
DNM2, PHE379VAL

In 3 sibs, born of consanguineous Pakistani parents, with lethal
congenital contracture syndrome-5 (LCCS5; 615368), Koutsopoulos et al.
(2013) identified a homozygous c.1135T-G transversion in exon 9 of the
DNM2 gene, resulting in a phe379-to-val (F379V) substitution at a highly
conserved residue in the middle domain of the protein. The mutation,
which was found by homozygosity mapping followed by candidate gene
sequencing, was not present in 100 Pakistani controls and was absent
from SNP databases. Patient fibroblasts showed a 20% reduction in
DNM2-dependent endocytosis, and recombinant F379V DNM2 showed a 20%
reduction in GTPase activity, consistent with its being a hypomorphic
allele. The patients showed decreased fetal movements and severe
hypotonia with respiratory insufficiency at birth. They had areflexia,
lack of spontaneous movement, joint contractures, and thin ribs and
bones. In addition, all had retinal hemorrhages and 2 had evidence of
intracranial bleeding (subdural hematoma and blood in the subarachnoid
cavity). Muscle biopsy of 1 patient showed small rounded fibers with
some centralized nuclei, suggestive of a congenital myopathy component,
whereas muscle biopsy of another patient showed showed atrophic fibers
without obvious centralization of nuclei. EMG studies of 1 patient
suggested a myopathy or lower motor neuron disease, whereas in the other
2 patients, EMG revealed low nerve conduction velocities, suggesting a
hypomyelinating neuropathy or anterior horn disease. Death occurred at
ages 5 days, 19 days, and 4 months. Both parents showed decreased
reflexes on examination, and skeletal muscle biopsy of the mother showed
fiber size variation and centralized nuclei, suggestive of a mild form
of centronuclear myopathy.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Through study of submicroscopic deletions in 2 unrelated patients with
familial adenomatous polyposis coli (FAP; 175100), Joslyn et al. (1991)
found 3 genes in a 100-kb deleted segment on chromosome 5. MCC (159350),
a previous candidate gene, was shown to be located outside the deleted
region. One of the new genes contained a sequence identical to SRP19
(182175). The second gene, provisionally designated DP1, was transcribed
in the same orientation as MCC. Two other cDNAs, DP2 and DP3, were found
to overlap, forming a single gene, DP2.5, which was transcribed in the
same orientation as SRP19. The DP2.5 gene was shown by Groden et al.
(1991) to be the polyposis gene, as indicated in 611731.

Transport of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to the cell surface
membrane is critical for receptor-ligand recognition. However, mammalian
GPCR odorant receptors (ORs), when heterologously expressed in cells,
are poorly expressed on the cell surface. By screening for genes that
induced cell surface expression of ORs expressed in human embryonic
kidney cells, Saito et al. (2004) identified mouse and human REEP1
(609139). They searched databases for homologs of REEP1 and identified
several other REEP genes, including DP1, which they called REEP5. In
situ hybridization of mouse olfactory epithelium revealed that, unlike
Reep1, Reep5 was not expressed in olfactory neurons.

GENE FUNCTION

Using an in vitro system to identify Xenopus membrane proteins involved
in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) network formation, followed by
localization, overexpression, and deletion experiments in mammalian and
yeast cells, Voeltz et al. (2006) identified the reticulons,
particularly Rtn4a/NogoA (604475), and the reticulon-interacting protein
DP1/Yop1 as the major components shaping the tubular ER.

MAPPING

Joslyn et al. (1991) identified the DP1 gene in a 100-kb segment on
chromosome 5 deleted in 2 patients with APC.

;;CALCIUM-BINDING PROTEIN 3; CABP3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching an EST database using CABP1 (605563) as the query, followed
by PCR of a retina cDNA library, Haeseleer et al. (2000) cloned a
full-length cDNA encoding CABP5. The deduced 173-amino acid protein
contains 3 putative functional EF-hands, which correspond to EF-hands 1,
3, and 4 of calmodulin (see 114180). CABP5 shares 96% similarity with
the mouse and bovine homologs and 58% similarity with calmodulin.
Northern blot analysis of multiple human tissues showed no CABP5
expression. However, expression of a 1.9-kb transcript was detected in
bovine retina. Immunolocalization of CABP5 in mouse, bovine, baboon, and
human retina revealed protein expressed only in rod and cone bipolar
cells. Protein extracted from bovine retina had an apparent molecular
mass of 16 kD. An 18-kD band showed sequences shared between CABP1 and
CABP5.

GENE FUNCTION

In an in vitro myristoylation assay, Haeseleer et al. (2000) found that
CABP5 is not myristoylated. It also did not bind the calmodulin-binding
domain of CAMK2 (see 114078), although it was able to stimulate CAMK2
activity in the presence of Ca(2+). CABP5 also inhibited G
protein-coupled receptor kinase-5 (GRK5; 600870)-mediated
phosphorylation of rhodopsin (180380), but its affinity for GRK5 was
lower than that shown by CABP1.

GENE STRUCTURE

Haeseleer et al. (2000) determined that the CABP5 gene contains 6 exons
and spans more than 14 kb.

MAPPING

By FISH, Haeseleer et al. (2000) mapped the CABP5 gene to chromosome
19q13.33.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Leukocyte surface antigen p150,95 shares a beta subunit (600065) with 2
other members of the leukocyte adhesion molecule family (120980, 153370)
but has a unique alpha chain. Corbi et al. (1987) cloned and sequenced
the gene for the alpha subunit of p150,95. The 4.7-kb cDNA clone encodes
a signal sequence, an extracellular domain of 1,081 amino acids
containing 10 potential glycosylation sites, a transmembrane domain of
26 amino acids, and a C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of 29 residues. It
shows homology to the alpha subunits of platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa
(607759), vitronectin receptor (193210), and fibronectin (135620)
receptor. The receptors involved in both cell-cell and cell-matrix
interactions appear to belong to a single superfamily of genes termed
the integrins.

MAPPING

By in situ hybridization, Corbi et al. (1988) demonstrated that the
genes encoding the alpha subunits of LFA-1, Mac1, and p150,95, all of
which play a part in leukocyte adhesion, constitute a cluster located on
16p13.1-p11. Callen et al. (1991) narrowed the assignment of the alpha-X
integrin (ITGAX) gene to 16p11.2.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

gene and systemic lupus erythematosus, see SLEB6 (609939).

;;GPR158-LIKE; GPR158L;;
GPR158L1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) constitute a large superfamily of
proteins that transmit signals from extracellular messenger molecules
and sensory stimuli to intracellular signaling pathways. GPR179 belongs
to the glutamate receptor subfamily of GPCRs (Bjarnadottir et al.,
2005).

CLONING

By searching databases for novel glutamate GPCRs, Bjarnadottir et al.
(2005) identified GPR179, which they called GPR158L. The deduced
2,367-amino acid protein has a long N terminus followed by the classic
7-transmembrane domain. Bjarnadottir et al. (2005) also identified mouse
Gpr158l.

In rd1 mice, which carry Pde6b (180072) mutations and are a naturally
occurring model of progressive rod photoreceptor degeneration, Audo et
al. (2012) analyzed whole-retina transcriptomic data and observed
increased expression of Gpr179 compared to that of wildtype mice.
Real-time PCR experiments confirmed the expression of GPR179 in human
retina, and Sanger sequencing of amplified RT-PCR products from retinas
confirmed the presence of the GPR179 transcript.

GENE STRUCTURE

Bjarnadottir et al. (2005) determined that the GPR179 gene contains 11
exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Bjarnadottir et al. (2005) mapped the
GPR179 gene to chromosome 17q12. They mapped the mouse Gpr179 gene to
chromosome 11.

GENE FUNCTION

In nob5 mice, which arose as a spontaneous mutation in a colony of C3H
mice and have a no b-wave (nob) phenotype on electroretinography (ERG),
Peachey et al. (2012) performed genetic mapping followed by
next-generation sequencing of the critical region and detected a large
transposon-like DNA insertion in the Gpr179 gene. Functional knockdown
of gpr179 in zebrafish led to a marked reduction in the amplitude of the
ERG b-wave.

Audo et al. (2012) stated that their localization of mouse Gpr179 to
horizontal cells and Muller cell endfeet was in error. Their new results
supported the conclusion of the parallel study of Peachey et al. (2012)
that Gpr179 is expressed in retinal bipolar cells.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 8 patients with complete congenital stationary night blindness
(CSNB1E; 614565) from 5 unrelated families, Audo et al. (2012)
identified homozygosity and compound heterozygosity for mutations in the
GPR179 gene in affected individuals (see, e.g.,
614515.0001-614515.0004).

Peachey et al. (2012) analyzed the candidate gene GPR179 in 44 cCSNB
patients lacking depolarizing bipolar cell (DBC) function and identified
2 probands with compound heterozygosity for inactivating mutations in
GPR179 (see 614515.0005-614515.0007).

In 3 affected sibs from a consanguineous family of Lebanese origin with
complete congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB1E; 614565), Audo et
al. (2012) identified homozygosity for a 1807C-T transition in exon 9 of
the GPR179 gene, resulting in a his603-to-tyr (H603Y) substitution at a
highly conserved residue in the external loop bridging the sixth and
seventh transmembranes. Their unaffected parents were heterozygous for
the mutation, which was not found in 366 controls.

al. (2012) identified homozygosity for 1-bp deletion (278delC) in exon 1
of the GPR179 gene, predicted to cause a frameshift resulting in a
premature termination codon. His unaffected parents were heterozygous
for the deletion, which was not found in 366 controls.

598C-T transition in exon 1 of the GPR179 gene, predicted to cause a
frameshift resulting in a premature termination codon, and a G-A splice
site transition in intron 8 (1784+1G-A; 614515.0004). Their unaffected
parents were each heterozygous for 1 of the mutations; neither mutation
was found in 378 controls.

heterozygosity for a 1-bp deletion (984delC) in the GPR179 gene,
predicted to result in premature protein truncation, and another
mutation: in the 10-year-old male proband, the second mutation was
another 1-bp deletion (187delC; 614515.0006), also predicted to result
in premature protein truncation, whereas in the 20-year-old female
proband of Norwegian descent, the second mutation was a 659A-G
transition resulting in a tyr220-to-cys (Y220C; 614515.0007)
substitution. The boy's unaffected parents were each heterozygous for 1
of the mutations he carried; DNA from the parents of the other proband
was unavailable. None of the 3 mutations was found in 210 control
chromosomes.

604046	TITLE *604046 OXIDATIVE STRESS-RESPONSIVE 1; OXSR1
;;OSR1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The 3p22-p21.3 chromosomal region is one of 3 regions of 3p that is
commonly deleted in various carcinomas. By analyzing a cloned segment
from this region, Tamari et al. (1999) identified OXSR1, which they
designated OSR1, because the predicted 527-amino acid protein shares 39%
identity with Ste20/oxidant stress-response kinase-1 (STK25; 602255).
Northern blot analysis detected a 4.6-kb major transcript in all tissues
tested. A less abundant 7.5-kb mRNA was detected in heart and skeletal
muscle.

Using RT-PCR, Chen et al. (2004) isolated an OXSR1 cDNA from HeLa cell
RNA. The deduced 527-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass
of 58 kD. OXSR1 contains an N-terminal Ste20-like serine/threonine
kinase domain and 2 C-terminal regions, designated PF1 and PF2,
conserved with other members of the germinal center kinase (GCK) VI
subfamily of Ste20 kinases, such as SPAK (STK39; 607648). At the end of
the PF1 domain, OXSR1 has a putative caspase-3 (CASP3; 600636) cleavage
site. Western blot analysis detected Oxsr1 at an apparent molecular mass
of 58 kD in all mouse tissues examined except thymus. Cell fractionation
and immunofluorescence analysis of HeLa cells showed that OXSR1 was
distributed throughout the cell.

GENE FUNCTION

Chen et al. (2004) found that OXSR1 could phosphorylate a test substrate
and itself. Of the potential regulators surveyed, endogenous OXSR1 was
activated only by osmotic stresses, notably sorbitol and, to a lesser
extent, NaCl. A 2-hybrid screen identified PAK1 (602590) as an OXSR1
target protein. OXSR1 phosphorylated thr84 within the N-terminal
regulatory domain of PAK1. Replacement of thr84 with gln reduced
activation of PAK1 by an active form of the small G protein CDC42
(116952), suggesting that phosphorylation by OXSR1 modulates the G
protein sensitivity of PAK.

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis of Jurkat human T cells and
immunoprecipitation analysis of human embryonic kidney cells and HeLa
cells, Anselmo et al. (2006) showed that OXSR1 and WNK1 (605232)
interacted through conserved C-terminal motifs. OSR1 was phosphorylated
in a WNK1-dependent manner, and depletion of WNK1 from HeLa cells with
small interfering RNA reduced OXSR1 kinase activity. Depletion of either
WNK1 or OXSR1 reduced Na-K-Cl cotransporter (NKCC; see 600839) activity,
suggesting that WNK1 and OSR1 are required for NKCC function.

GENE STRUCTURE

Tamari et al. (1999) determined that the OXSR1 gene contains 18 exons
and spans approximately 90 kb.

MAPPING

Daigo et al. (1999) reported that the OXSR1 gene is located between the
OCTL1 (604047) and MYD88 (602170) genes on chromosome 3p22-p21.3.

;;HPAII TINY FRAGMENTS LOCUS 9C; HTF9C
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Guarguaglini et al. (1997) cloned mouse Htf9c, which encodes a deduced
676-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 75 kD. Htf9c
has a putative N-terminal nuclear targeting signal and a C-terminal
domain similar to yeast and bacterial nucleic acid-modifying enzymes.

GENE FUNCTION

Guarguaglini et al. (1997) found that mouse Htf9c and Ranbp1 (601180)
were divergently transcribed from a bidirectional promoter. Expression
of both genes was activated upon entry into the cell cycle, peaked in S
phase, and was downregulated during completion of the cell cycle. The
bidirectional promoter was downregulated in both orientations in
arrested cells. Activation of the promoter was specific, resulting in
more restricted Htf9c expression and a sharper peak of Htf9c expression
in S phase compared with Ranbp1 expression. A region containing an E2f
(189971) site was important for cell cycle control of Htf9c, and a
common region containing sites for Sp1 (189906) and E2f contributed to
activation in both orientations.

MAPPING

Hartz (2007) mapped the HTF9C gene to chromosome 22q11.21 based on an
alignment of the TRMT2A sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK025106) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.1).

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database analysis and PCR of human and mouse testis cDNA libraries,
Rorick et al. (2011) cloned 2 splice variants of human and mouse WDR65.
The deduced full-length human protein contains 1,283 amino acids and has
2 WD repeat domains. The shorter human variant encodes a deduced
698-amino acid protein that is truncated after the 2 WD repeat domains.
PCR analysis of mouse tissues revealed highest Wdr65 expression in lung,
testis, and skin. Weaker expression was detected in brain and kidney,
and no expression was detected in heart, liver, skeletal muscle, and
spleen. Wdr65 was expressed in mouse embryonic stem cells and in whole
mouse embryos beginning at about 15 days postcoitum. In situ
hybridization revealed Wdr65 expression in mouse nasal epithelium and
medial edge epithelium at 14.5 days postcoitum, and in nasal respiratory
epithelium and epidermis, but not oral epithelium, at 15.5 days
postcoitum. The increase in Wdr65 expression in these embryonic mouse
craniofacial tissues correlated with development and dissolution of the
epithelial seam.

Rorick et al. (2011) determined that the WDR65 gene contains 24 exons.

MAPPING

Rorick et al. (2011) reported that the WDR65 gene maps to chromosome
1p34.2. The mouse Wdr65 gene maps to a region of chromosome 4 that
shares homology of synteny with human chromosome 1p36-p32.

GENE FUNCTION

Using microarray analysis, Rorick et al. (2011) showed that expression
of Wdr65 was significantly downregulated in Irf6 (607199)-deficient
mouse embryos compared with wildtype embryos. Database analysis revealed
an IRF6-binding site for WDR65 in an exon of the EBNA1BP2 gene (614443),
which is located 63 bp upstream of WDR65 on the opposite strand.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a Brazilian patient with van der Woude syndrome (606713), Rorick et
al. (2011) identified heterozygosity for a possibly causative missense
mutation at a conserved residue in the WDR65 gene (614259.0001).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
RECLASSIFIED - VARIANT OF UNKNOWN SIGNIFICANCE
WDR65, ASP523TYR

This variant, formerly titled VAN DER WOUDE SYNDROME 2 (606713), has
been reclassified because its contribution to the phenotype has not been
confirmed.

In a Brazilian patient with van der Woude syndrome-2, Rorick et al.
(2011) identified a heterozygous 1567G-T transversion in exon 10 of the
WDR65 gene, resulting in an asp523-to-tyr (D523Y) substitution at a
conserved residue. Because the mutation was not found in controls and
significantly changes the biochemical properties of a conserved residue,
Rorick et al. (2011) concluded that it was potentially etiologic.

603493	TITLE *603493 POTASSIUM CHANNEL, SUBFAMILY K, MEMBER 5; KCNK5
;;TASK2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The KCNK5 gene encodes a noninactivating, outwardly rectifying,
potassium channel expressed in the kidney and in T cells (summary by
Bittner et al., 2010). Potassium channels conduct the flux of potassium
ions through the membranes of virtually all living cells and are
involved in the control of numerous cellular functions, such as neuronal
firing, muscle contraction, volume regulation, and hormone secretion.
One class of mammalian potassium channels, which includes TWIK1 (KCNK1;
601745), TREK (KCNK2; 603219), and TASK1 (KCNK3; 603220), is
characterized by 2 pore-forming (P) domains and 4 transmembrane segments
(Reyes et al., 1998).

CLONING

By searching sequence databases with the protein sequences of 2P domain
potassium channels, Reyes et al. (1998) identified an EST encoding
TASK2, a new member of this class. They used the EST to screen a human
kidney cDNA library and isolated a full-length TASK2 (GenBank GENBANK
AF084830) cDNA that encodes a deduced 499-amino acid polypeptide with a
calculated molecular mass of 55.1 kD. TASK2 has all the hallmarks of a
2P domain potassium channel, but shows only 18 to 22% amino acid
identity with other 2P domain potassium channels. COS cells expressing
TASK2 displayed noninactivating currents, and the current-voltage
relationship was outwardly rectifying. Like TASK1 currents, TASK2
currents were highly sensitive to extracellular pH in the physiologic
range. Northern blot analysis of adult human tissues detected a 4-kb
TASK2 transcript that was expressed abundantly in kidney and to a lesser
extent in the pancreas, liver, placenta, and small intestine. In situ
hybridization of human kidney localized TASK2 mRNA to the cortical
distal tubules and collecting ducts. Reyes et al. (1998) suggested that
TASK2 plays an important role in renal potassium transport.

MAPPING

Reyes et al. (1998) mapped the TASK2 gene to chromosome 6p21 by
radiation hybrid mapping.

GENE FUNCTION

Bittner et al. (2010) demonstrated that TASK2 is constitutively
expressed on human T cells, contributes to the resting membrane
potential, is sensitive to clofilium and quinidine, and is upregulated
by stimulation of T cells. TASK2 is preferentially expressed on CD4+ T
helper and CD8+ cytotoxic T cells. Peripheral CD4+ T cells derived from
patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS; 126200) showed
a significant upregulation of TASK2 (2-fold) during relapse compared to
those from MS patients with stable disease and to controls. TASK2
expression on peripheral CD8+ T cells was more significantly increased
in MS patients with acute relapse (7.6-fold) and in those with stable
disease (3.3-fold). CSF-derived and CNS lesion-derived cytotoxic T cells
from MS patients showed an even greater increase in TASK2 expression
compared to peripheral cells. No increase in TASK2 expression was seen
in patients with neuromyelitis optica, another neurologic inflammatory
disease believed to be mediated by B cells. Pharmacologic or
siRNA-mediated knockdown of TASK2 in T cells reduced proliferation and
cytokine production, indicating that TASK2 is a key mediator of T-cell
physiology.

ANIMAL MODEL

Warth et al. (2004) found that Task2-null mice showed increased
perinatal mortality. After weaning, knockout mice thrived and were
fertile, but they had reduced body weight and arterial blood pressure
compared with wildtype mice. Patch-clamp experiments on wildtype and
Task2-knockout renal proximal tubular cells indicated that Task2
channels were activated by the rise in basolateral extracellular pH
induced by bicarbonate transport. Inulin clearance measurements showed
Task2-null mice had normal NaCl and water excretion. During intravenous
bicarbonate perfusion, however, renal Na(+) and water reabsorption
capacity was reduced. In conscious Task2-null mice, blood pH,
bicarbonate concentration, and systemic base excess were reduced, but
urinary pH and bicarbonate concentration were increased. Warth et al.
(2004) concluded that Task2-knockout mice exhibited metabolic acidosis
caused by renal loss of bicarbonate ion.

607588	TITLE *607588 PEPTIDYL-PROLYL ISOMERASE-LIKE 2; PPIL2
;;CYCLOPHILIN, 60-KD; CYP60
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using the proteinase inhibitor eglin c in a yeast 2-hybrid screen, Wang
et al. (1996) cloned PPIL2, which they designated CYP60, from a Raji
B-lymphocyte cDNA library. The deduced 520-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of about 60 kD. PPIL2 contains sequences
characteristic of the cyclophilin family, but it lacks several highly
conserved residues. It has a unique 288-amino acid N terminus and a
unique 109-amino acid C terminus. Northern blot analysis detected
ubiquitous expression of 3.0- and 4.4-kb transcripts. Expression was
highest in thymus, pancreas, and testis, and in a myelogenous leukemia
cell line. Expression of the 2 transcripts appeared equal in all tissues
except testis, small intestine, and colon, where the 4.4-kb transcript
dominated. Testis and leukemia cells also had a 2-kb transcript. Western
blot analysis revealed a protein with an apparent molecular mass of
about 68 kD with highest levels in kidney. Several other bands, ranging
from 40 to 60 kD, were also detected, and these appeared to represent
processed forms of the full-length protein. Immunofluorescence of
endogenous PPIL2 in leukemia cells and transfected PPIL2 in COS-7 cells
revealed nuclear localization. Immunohistochemical analysis detected
PPIL2 in a wide variety of normal tissues and cells and in most
lymphomas and melanomas. However, little or no staining was observed in
mitotically inactive cell types such as neuronal and smooth or cardiac
muscle.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the PPIL2
gene to chromosome 22q11.21.

610405	TITLE *610405 CHONDROITIN POLYMERIZING FACTOR; CHPF
;;CHONDROITIN SULFATE SYNTHASE 2; CSS2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database searching with the sequence of CHSY1 (608183) as probe,
Kitagawa et al. (2003) isolated CHPF. The deduced 775-amino acid protein
has a predicted molecular mass of approximately 85 kD and contains 3
potential N-glycosylation sites. CHPF has a prominent N-terminal
hydrophobic segment and is predicted to be a type II transmembrane
protein. CHPF shares 57% and 23% sequence identity with chondroitin
sulfate glucuronyltransferase (CSGlcAT; 608037) and CHSY1, respectively.
Northern blot analysis detected a 3.4-kb CHPF transcript in all tissues
examined except peripheral blood leukocytes; CHPF expression was
detected at high levels in placenta and heart and at moderate levels in
brain, skeletal muscle, kidney, and liver.

Yada et al. (2003) independently isolated CHPF, which they called CSS2,
by database searching with the sequence of CSGlcAT as probe. Although
Kitagawa et al. (2003) stated that CHPF lacks the conserved DXD motif
found in most glycosyltransferases, Yada et al. (2003) identified a DXD
motif and another motif conserved in beta-1,3-glycosyltransferases in
the N terminus of the protein. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis
detected CHPF expression in all tissues examined, with highest
expression in pancreas, ovary, placenta, small intestine, and stomach.

GENE FUNCTION

Kitagawa et al. (2003) found that the expression of a soluble
recombinant form of CHPF in COS-1 cells produced a protein with little
glucuronyltransferase (GlcAT-II) or N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase
(GalNAcT-II) activities responsible for the biosynthesis of repeating
disaccharide units of chondroitin sulfate. However, coexpression of CHPF
and CHSY1 yielded markedly augmented glycosyltransferase activity,
whereas simple mixing of the 2 separately expressed proteins did not.
When both GlcUA and GalNAc were used as sugar donors, chondroitin
polymerization was demonstrated on the so-called
glycosaminoglycan-protein linkage region tetrasaccharide sequence of
alpha-thrombomodulin. Kitagawa et al. (2003) concluded that the
chondroitin polymerizing activity requires concomitant expression of
CHPF with CHSY1.

In experiments with a soluble recombinant form of CHPF in COS-7 cells,
Yada et al. (2003) found that CHPF displayed dual GlcAT-II and
GalNAcT-II glycosyltransferase activities. They concluded that CHPF
plays a role in chondroitin sulfate chain synthesis.

GENE STRUCTURE

The CHPF gene contains at least 4 exons and spans over 5 kb (Kitagawa et
al., 2003; Yada et al., 2003).

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Kitagawa et al. (2003) mapped the CHPF gene to
chromosome 2q35-q36. By the same method, Yada et al. (2003) mapped the
gene to 2q36.1.
