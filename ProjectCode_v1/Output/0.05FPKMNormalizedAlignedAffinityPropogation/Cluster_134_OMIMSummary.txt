DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

IPO13 is a member of the importin-beta superfamily (see 602738).
Importins mediate translocation through nuclear pore complexes.
Cooperation with the RanGTPase system allows them to bind and
subsequently release their substrates on opposite sides of the nuclear
envelope ensuring direct nucleocytoplasmic transport (Mingot et al.,
2001).

CLONING

By screening human brain cDNAs for those encoding proteins larger than
50 kD, Nagase et al. (1998) identified IPO13, which they called
KIAA0734. RT-PCR Elisa detected IPO13 in all tissues tested, with
highest expression in brain.

By EST database searching for sequences with significant homology to
known members of the importin-beta superfamily, Mingot et al. (2001)
identified IPO13, which encodes a deduced 963-amino acid protein with a
predicted molecular mass of 108 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

By mass spectrometry, Mingot et al. (2001) identified several proteins
from HeLa cell extract that bound specifically to IPO13; these included
ribosomal protein L5 (603634), RBM8 (605313), and UBC9 (UBE2I; 601661).
Each could be displaced by RanGTP and are most likely import substrates.
The translation initiation factor eIF1A (see 300186) bound only in the
presence of RanGTP and is a potential IOP13-specific export substrate.

Ploski et al. (2004) demonstrated that IOP13 mediates nuclear import of
paired-type homeodomain transcription factors (e.g., PAX6; 607108) and
that the import is achieved via a nuclear localization signal that
includes the paired-type homeodomain.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the IOP13 gene
to chromosome 1.

611478	TITLE *611478 METHYLPHOSPHATE CAPPING ENZYME; MEPCE
;;BICOID-INTERACTING 3, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF; BCDIN3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using SEREX (serological identification of antigens by recombinant
expression cloning) in chronic myeloid leukemia, followed by screening a
chromosome 7 cosmid library, Rogers et al. (2002) cloned MEPCE, which
they called clone 4. Northern blot analysis detected highest expression
of a 2.4-kb transcript in testis, with lower levels in adrenal gland,
brain, cerebellum, kidney, lung, mammary gland, and chronic myeloid
leukemia. Expression of MEPCE was not detected in normal bone marrow.

Positive transcription factor b (P-TEFb), a heterodimer of CDK9 (603251)
and a cyclin partner, controls the elongation phase of transcription by
RNA polymerase II (see 180660). Jeronimo et al. (2007) identified MEPCE,
which they called BCDIN3, as a P-TEFb-associated protein in HEK293 human
embryonic kidney cells. The deduced 689-amino acid protein has a central
RNA methylase domain and a C-terminal Bin3 domain. Database analysis
revealed homologs of MEPCE in both higher and lower eukaryotes.

GENE FUNCTION

Using affinity purification, mass spectrometry, and bioinformatic
analysis, Jeronimo et al. (2007) mapped an interaction network of
protein complexes involved in the RNA polymerase II machinery. They
found that P-TEFb was associated with a number of proteins, including
MEPCE, in the soluble nuclear compartment in HEK293 cells. Gel
filtration confirmed that P-TEFb, HEXIM1 (607328), and SART3 (611684)
cofractionated with MEPCE, and RNA blot analysis showed that 7SK (RN7SK;
606515) and U6 (RNU6; 180692) small nuclear RNAs were also present in
the complex. In the presence of radiolabeled S-adenosyl methionine,
recombinant MEPCE methylated recombinant 7SK in vitro. MEPCE required
5-prime phosphates of 7SK, demonstrating that MEPCE is a 7SK
methylphosphate capping enzyme. Silencing of MEPCE by small interfering
RNA decreased the steady-state level of cellular 7SK, suggesting that
MEPCE stabilizes 7SK by adding a methylphosphate cap at its 5-prime end.

GENE STRUCTURE

Rogers et al. (2002) determined that the MEPCE gene contains 4 exons,
spans 4.5 kb, and is associated with a CpG island.

MAPPING

Using FISH, Rogers et al. (2002) mapped the MEPCE gene to chromosome
7q22.

608830	TITLE *608830 RETINOL DEHYDROGENASE 12; RDH12
;;RETINOL DEHYDROGENASE, ALL-TRANS AND 9-CIS
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Retinoids are indispensable light-sensitive elements of vision and also
serve as essential modulators of cellular differentiation and
proliferation in diverse cell types. RDH12 belongs to a family of
dual-specificity retinol dehydrogenases that metabolize both all-trans-
and cis-retinols (Haeseleer et al., 2002).

CLONING

By searching databases for sequences similar to RDH11 (607849), followed
by PCR of a retina cDNA library, Haeseleer et al. (2002) cloned RDH12.
The deduced 316-amino acid RDH12 protein has a calculated molecular mass
of about 35 kD and shares 79% similarity with RDH11. RDH12 contains 2
motifs highly conserved among short chain alcohol
dehydrogenases/reductases, the cofactor-binding site and catalytic
residues. EST database analysis indicated that RDH12 is expressed
predominantly in eye and also in kidney, brain, skeletal muscle, and
stomach. In situ hybridization to monkey and mouse retina indicated
Rdh12 is expressed at the base of photoreceptor inner segments.

GENE STRUCTURE

Haeseleer et al. (2002) determined that the RDH12 gene contains 7 exons
and spans about 13 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Haeseleer et al. (2002) mapped the RDH12
gene to chromosome 14q23.3, where it lies about 30 kb from the RDH11
gene and within the locus for the recessive blinding disease Leber
congenital amaurosis-13 (LCA13; 612712).

GENE FUNCTION

Haeseleer et al. (2002) determined that recombinant RDH12 was expressed
in insect cells as a membrane protein with enzymatic properties similar
to those of RDH11. Both enzymes catalyzed the reduction of
all-trans-retinal and its 9-cis-, 11-cis-, and 13-cis-retinal isomers in
the presence of NADPH. Analysis of the reactions suggested that these
enzymes catalyze the reaction in both directions
(NADPH/retinals--NADP/retinols), with equal utilization of
11-cis-retinal and all trans-retinal. No steroid dehydrogenase activity
was detected for RDH12. RDH12 activity was potently inhibited by
retinoic acids, recombinant CRBP1 (180260), and CRALBP (180090).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Janecke et al. (2004) described 3 consanguineous kindreds with LCA13
(612712) in which relatedness seemed likely because of geographic
proximity and similar disease phenotype, although genealogic studies
could not link the families. A whole-genome scan by microarray analysis
of SNPs identified a founder haplotype and defined a critical interval
of 1.53 cM on 14q23.3-q24.1 that contained the RDH12 gene, encoding a
retinol dehydrogenase thought to function in the visual cycle (Haeseleer
et al., 2002). All affected family members studied from the 3 kindreds,
as well as 2 Austrian individuals with sporadic LCA, were found to be
homozygous for a tyr226-to-cys mutation in the RDH12 gene (Y226C;
608830.0001). Janecke et al. (2004) identified additional mutations in
RDH12 in 3 of 89 non-Austrian individuals with LCA13: 806delCCCTG
(608830.0002) and gln189 to ter (Q189X; 608830.0003), each in homozygous
state, and thr49 to met (T49M; 608830.0004) and arg62 to ter (R62X;
608830.0005) in compound heterozygosity. The severe visual impairment of
individuals with mutations in RDH12 was in marked contrast to the mild
visual deficiency in individuals with fundus albipunctatus (136880)
caused by mutations in RDH5 (601617), encoding another retinol
dehydrogenase.

Perrault et al. (2004) studied a series of 110 unrelated patients with
LCA; in 4.1% of the patients, they identified mutations in the RDH12
gene: 1 splice site (608830.0013), 1 frameshift deletion (608830.0002),
2 nonsense mutations (608830.0005, 608830.0006), and 7 missense
mutations (608830.0001, 608830.0007-608830.0012). All patients harboring
RDH12 mutations had a severe yet progressive rod-cone dystrophy with
severe macular atrophy but no or mild hyperopia; Perrault et al. (2004)
noted that this phenotype may represent the upper extreme of the
spectrum of retinitis pigmentosa (RP; see 268000). No RDH12 mutations
were identified in patients presenting with congenital stationary
cone-rod dystrophy.

In a cohort of 1,011 individuals diagnosed with autosomal recessive
retinal dystrophy, Thompson et al. (2005) identified 20 different
disease-associated RDH12 mutations in a total of 22 individuals.
Haplotype analysis suggested a founder mutation for each of the 3 common
mutations: L99I (608830.0010), T155I (608830.0014), and 806_810delCCCTG
(608830.0002). Patients typically presented with early disease that
affected the function of both rods and cones and progressed to legal
blindness in early adulthood. Eleven of the missense variants identified
exhibited profound loss of catalytic activity when expressed in
transiently transfected COS-7 cells and assayed for ability to convert
all-trans retinal to all-trans retinol. Loss of function appeared to
result from decreased protein stability, as expression levels were
significantly reduced.

In a large 6-generation family segregating autosomal dominant retinitis
pigmentosa mapping to chromosome 14q (RP53; see 612712), Fingert et al.
(2008) sequenced the candidate gene RDH12 and identified heterozygosity
for a 1-bp deletion (608830.0015) in 19 affected individuals that was
not found in unaffected family members or in 158 controls.

In a large, highly consanguineous pedigree segregating autosomal
recessive early-onset retinitis pigmentosa, Benayoun et al. (2009)
identified a homozygous missense mutation (A126V; 608830.0016) that
segregated with disease in 8 sibships.

LEBER CONGENITAL AMAUROSIS 13
RDH12, TYR226CYS

In affected members of 3 consanguineous Austrian kindreds with Leber
congenital amaurosis-13 (612712), Janecke et al. (2004) identified
homozygosity for a 677A-G transition in exon 6 of the RDH12 gene,
resulting in a tyr226-to-cys (Y226C) substitution. The same mutation was
identified in 2 Austrian individuals with sporadic LCA13. Janecke et al.
(2004) demonstrated that, when expressed in COS-7 cells, the cys226
variant had diminished activity in interconverting isomers of retinol
and retinal.

In affected members of a French family with LCA, Perrault et al. (2004)
identified the Y226C mutation in compound heterozygous state with a
523T-C transition in exon 5 of the RDH12 gene, resulting in a
ser175-to-pro substitution (S175P; 608830.0011).

.0002
LEBER CONGENITAL AMAUROSIS 13
RDH12, 5-BP DEL, NT806

In a 19-year-old individual with Leber congenital amaurosis-13 (612712),
Janecke et al. (2004) identified a homozygous 5-bp deletion in exon 6 of
the RDH12 gene, 806delCCCTG, resulting in a frameshift and a premature
stop codon at position 269. Visual acuity was reduced to light reception
in the right eye and 0.05 in the left eye. ERGs were extinguished, and
the fundi showed heavy hyperpigmentation with bone spicule-like pattern.

In affected members of 4 unrelated French families with Leber congenital
amaurosis-13, Perrault et al. (2004) identified the 806delCCCTG
mutation. The mutation was present in homozygous state in 1 family, and
in the 3 other families it was present in compound heterozygous state
with either a 451C-A transversion in exon 5, resulting in a
his151-to-asn mutation (H151N; 608830.0007), a 687C-G transversion in
exon 6, resulting in a pro230-to-ala substitution (P230A; 608830.008),
or a 638+1G-A (608830.0013) splice site mutation.

LEBER CONGENITAL AMAUROSIS 13
RDH12, GLN189TER

In a male patient of Turkish origin with Leber congenital amaurosis-13
(612712), the offspring of consanguineous parents, Janecke et al. (2004)
identified a homozygous 565C-T transition in exon 5 of the RDH12 gene,
resulting in a gln189-to-ter (Q189X) substitution. The diagnosis of
LCA13 had also been made in the patient's sister.

.0004
LEBER CONGENITAL AMAUROSIS 13
RDH12, THR49MET

In a woman with Leber congenital amaurosis-13 (612712), the offspring of
nonconsanguineous parents, Janecke et al. (2004) identified compound
heterozygosity for mutations in exon 2 of the RDH12 gene: a 146C-T
transition, resulting in a thr49-to-met (T49M) substitution, and a
184C-T transition, resulting in an arg62-to-ter (R62X; 608830.0005)
substitution. Janecke et al. (2004) demonstrated that, when expressed in
COS-7 cells, the met49 variant had aberrant activity in interconverting
isomers of retinol and retinal.

Thompson et al. (2005) found differing activity profiles for the T49M
variant associated with each of the alleles of the R161Q RDH12
polymorphism, suggesting that genetic background may act as a modifier
of mutation effect.

that resulted in a thr155-to-ile substitution (T155I). The mutation was
homozygous in 2 patients and carried heterozygously on the maternal
allele in the third; the paternal allele carried an H151D mutation
(608830.0009). Haplotype analysis indicated that the T115I substitution
is a founder mutation.

RDH12, 1-BP DEL, 776G

In affected members of a large 6-generation family segregating autosomal
dominant retinitis pigmentosa (RP53; see 612712), Fingert et al. (2008)
identified heterozygosity for a 1-bp deletion (776delG) in the RDH12
gene, resulting in a premature termination codon predicted to eliminate
the highly conserved 57 terminal amino acids of RDH12. The mutation was
not found in unaffected family members or in 158 controls.

.0016
RETINITIS PIGMENTOSA 53
RDH12, ALA126VAL

In 14 affected members from 8 sibships of a large, highly consanguineous
pedigree segregating autosomal recessive early-onset retinitis
pigmentosa (see 612712), Benayoun et al. (2009) identified homozygosity
for a 377C-T transition in exon 4 of the RDH12 gene, resulting in an
ala126-to-val (A126V) substitution at a conserved residue within the RDH
domain. A 45-year-old male family member who was heterozygous for A126V
appeared to have a subclinical phenotype: although he did not describe
significant subjective visual difficulties and denied nyctalopia or
photosensitivity, his photopic ERG was at the lower limit of the normal
range and his scotopic ERG was markedly reduced. In a screen of 159
controls, 1 heterozygous carrier was detected, indicating a carrier
frequency of 0.62% in this population.

610955	TITLE *610955 TRAFFICKING PROTEIN PARTICLE COMPLEX, SUBUNIT 3; TRAPPC3
;;BET3, YEAST, HOMOLOG OF; BET3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TRAPPC3 is a component of the TRAPP complex, which is involved in
tethering of transport vesicles to the cis-Golgi membrane (Turnbull et
al., 2005).

CLONING

Loh et al. (2005) reported that the human TRAPPC3 protein, which they
called BET3, contains 180 amino acids. Northern blot analysis detected
Bet3 expression in all mouse tissues examined. Western blot analysis of
fractionated rat liver showed that most Bet3 was present in the
cytosolic fraction, with a lesser amount in the Golgi-enriched membrane
fraction.

By immunohistochemical analysis, Yu et al. (2006) found that endogenous
BET3 showed perinuclear localization in several mammalian cell lines,
including HeLa cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Loh et al. (2005) found that antibodies against Bet3 inhibited in vitro
transport of the envelope glycoprotein of vesicular stomatitis virus
from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus of
semi-intact rat kidney cells in a dose-dependent manner. Cytosol
depleted of Bet3 was also defective in this transport and could be
rescued by recombinant Bet3. Bet3 acted after coat protein II (COPII;
see 601924) but before Rab1 (179508), alpha-Snap (NAPA; 603215), and the
EGTA-sensitive stage during ER-Golgi transport.

Turnbull et al. (2005) found that both human and yeast BET3 were
palmitoylated in recombinant yeast cells, but palmitoylation of BET3 was
only partly responsible for the its membrane localization. Both wildtype
yeast Bet3 and mutant yeast Bet3 lacking palmitoylation rescued cell
viability in Bet3-deleted yeast, suggesting that palmitoylation is not
required for cell viability. Despite high sequence conservation, human
BET3 failed to rescue Bet3-deleted yeast.

In mammalian cells, COPII vesicles derived from the transitional ER do
not tether directly to the Golgi, but rather tether to each other to
form vesicular tubular clusters (VTCs). Using various mammalian cell
lines, including HeLa cells, Yu et al. (2006) showed that BET3 resided
in the transitional ER and adjacent to VTCs. Inactivation of BET3
resulted in accumulation of cargo in membranes that colocalized with the
COPII coat. Using an assay that reconstituted VTC biogenesis in vitro,
Yu et al. (2006) demonstrated that BET3 was required for the tethering
and fusion of COPII vesicles to each other. Depletion of BET3 by small
interfering RNA disrupted a VTC marker and Golgi architecture. Yu et al.
(2006) concluded that BET3 is essential for VTC biogenesis.

Cai et al. (2007) reported that in yeast and mammalian cells the
tethering complex TRAPP I binds to the coat subunit SEC23 (see 610511).
This event requires the BET3 subunit. In vitro studies demonstrated that
the interaction between SEC23 and BET3 targets TRAPP I to COPII vesicles
to mediate vesicle tethering. Cai et al. (2007) proposed that the
binding of TRAPP I to SEC23 marks a coated vesicle for fusion with
another COPII vesicle or the Golgi apparatus. An implication of these
findings is that the intracellular destination of a transport vesicle
may be determined in part by its coat and its associated cargo.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Turnbull et al. (2005) determined the crystal structure of human BET3 to
1.55-angstrom resolution. BET3 assumes an alpha/beta-plait topology
constructed by a twisted, antiparallel, 4-stranded beta sheet on one
side, with the 5 alpha helices forming the other side of the structural
motif. BET3 forms a dimer around the crystallographic 2-fold axis. A
hydrophobic pocket within the core of the alpha-helical face contains an
internal palmitate molecule covalently attached through a thioester
linkage to the conserved cys68.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the TRAPPC3
gene to chromosome 1 (TMAP RH80455).

;;OLF3
DESCRIPTION The mammalian olfactory receptor gene family is made up of hundreds of
genes that encode an immense variety of membrane-bound G protein-coupled
receptors. The receptors share several hallmark sequence motifs, yet are
quite variable in the region of the protein thought to be responsible
for binding odorants (Issel-Tarver and Rine, 1997). See also 164342.

CLONING

By using dog Or2f1 as probe to screen a Southern blot, followed by
subcloning the appropriate genomic fragment, Issel-Tarver and Rine
(1997) cloned OR2F1, which they called OLF3. The deduced 317-amino acid
protein contains an extracellular N-terminal domain with a potential
N-glycosylation site, 7 predicted transmembrane segments, and potential
C-terminal phosphorylation sites. Human and canine OR2F1 share 86%
identity.

MAPPING

By Southern hybridization and PCR analysis, Issel-Tarver and Rine (1997)
mapped the OR2F1 gene to chromosome 7q35.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The GTF2IRD1 gene was identified within the chromosomal region on
7q11.23 commonly deleted in Williams syndrome (194050) and is involved
in mammalian craniofacial and cognitive development (Tassabehji et al.,
2005).

CLONING

Tassabehji et al. (1999) isolated and characterized a 3.4-kb gene, which
they called general transcription factor III (GTF3), which occupies
about 140 kb of the region deleted in Williams syndrome. Northern blot
analysis showed that the gene is expressed in skeletal muscle and heart,
and RT-PCR analysis showed expression in a range of adult tissues with
stronger expression in fetal tissues. Part of the conceptual GTF3
protein sequence was found to be almost identical to a slow muscle-fiber
enhancer binding protein identified by O'Mahoney et al. (1998) and
termed MusTRD1. GTF3 showed significant homology to the 90-amino acid
putative helix-loop-helix repeat (HLH) domains of the transcription
factor TFII-I (GTF2I; 601679), which maps distal to GTF4 within the
Williams syndrome deleted region.

Osborne et al. (1999) identified the same gene, which they termed
WBSCR11, by genomic DNA sequence analysis and screening of 2 colon
carcinoma cell line cDNA libraries. The cDNA sequence predicts an
895-amino acid protein.

Franke et al. (1999) cloned GTF2IRD1 from cDNA libraries representing
several diverse tissues, and they obtained a full-length cDNA by 5-prime
RACE of an adult brain cDNA library. They also identified several splice
variants arising from exon skipping. The longest deduced protein
contains 944 amino acids. In addition to the repeated GTF2I motifs and
HLH repeats, Franke et al. (1999) identified a myc (190080)-type HLH
dimerization domain, a number of putative phosphorylation sites and
N-myristoylation sites, an amidation site, and several putative nuclear
localization signals. Northern blot analysis detected expression of
GTF2IRD1 in all adult and fetal tissues except leukocytes. The dominant
transcript was 3.6 kb long, with sizes ranging from 1.5 kb to 5.0 kb.

By Western blot analysis, Yan et al. (2000) found that endogenous
GTF2IRD1, which they designated CREAM1, was expressed at low levels as a
120-kD protein in a variety of human cell lines and tissues. GTF2IRD1
was expressed in the nucleus of transfected cells, and deletion of the
C-terminal nuclear localization signal resulted in cytoplasmic
expression.

Bayarsaihan and Ruddle (2000) cloned mouse Gtf2ird1, which they
designated Ben. The deduced full-length 1,072-amino acid protein
contains an N-terminal leucine zipper motif, followed by 6
helix-loop-helix domains, a nuclear localization signal, and a
C-terminal serine-rich region. Northern blot analysis detected several
Ben transcripts in all mouse tissues examined. Western blot analysis
showed several Ben isoforms with apparent molecular masses of 40 to 165
kD.

GENE STRUCTURE

Osborne et al. (1999) determined that the WBSCR11 gene spans 95 kb of
genomic DNA and consists of 26 exons, not including the last noncoding
exon.

Franke et al. (1999) determined that the GTF2IRD1 gene contains up to 30
exons and spans about 105 kb. The coding sequence uses 26 exons.

Palmer et al. (2010) determined that the region upstream of the GTF2IRD1
gene contains a well-conserved CCAAT box and 3 canonical
GTF2IRD1-recognition sequences (GGATTA), one of which is inverted.

MAPPING

Franke et al. (1999) reported that the GF2IRD1 gene maps within the WBS
deletion region on chromosome 7q11.23 and is oriented 5-prime to 3-prime
in the centromeric to telomeric orientation.

Tassabehji et al. (1999) tabulated 11 genes in addition to GTF3 that had
been mapped to the deleted area of chromosome 7 in classic Williams
syndrome.

Lazebnik et al. (2008) stated that the mouse Gtf2ird1 gene maps to a
region of chromosome 5 that shares homology of synteny with human
chromosome 7.

GENE FUNCTION

Yan et al. (2000) determined that GTF2IRD1 interacted with the RB1
protein (614041) in vitro and in vivo. They also showed that full length
GTF2IRD1 stimulated transcription of a reporter gene and, by mutation
analysis, they localized the activation domain to the N terminus.

Using yeast 1-hybrid analysis, Bayarsaihan and Ruddle (2000) showed that
in vitro-translated mouse Ben interacted with an early enhancer upstream
of the Hoxc8 (142970) transcription start site.

Ring et al. (2002) characterized the Xenopus homolog of GTF2IRD1,
Xwbscr11. They determined that Xwbscr11 binds DNA via selective HLH
repeats and interacts with the transcription factor FOXH1 (603621) and
the signal transduction molecules Smad2 (601366) and Smad3 (603109) to
affect activin (147290)/nodal-mediated induction of the distal element
of the Xenopus goosecoid promoter.

Vullhorst and Buonanno (2003) characterized mouse Gtf3 splice variants.
They determined that HLH domain 4 is necessary and sufficient for
binding the bicoid-like motif of the troponin (191042) enhancer. An
isoform that lacks exon 23 and exons 26 through 28 interacted most
avidly with the bicoid-like motif. Isoforms that included these exons
failed to bind in gel retardation assays. The authors also determined
that Gtf3 polypeptides associate with each other via the leucine zipper.

Lazebnik et al. (2008) showed that BEN bound the 8-bp core consensus
sequence CAG(C/G)G(C/A)GA, surrounded by G- and C-rich sequences. BEN
repressed expression of a reporter gene containing 3 copies of the
sequence 5-prime-GGGGGCAGCGACAGCCCCC-3-prime. Knockdown of Ben
expression in C2C12 mouse myoblasts enhanced expression of Bmpr1b
(603248), Sox4 (184430), En1 (131290), and Fgf15, the mouse ortholog of
FGF19 (603891). Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis followed by
quantitative PCR confirmed binding of BEN to Fgf15.

Palmer et al. (2010) found that GTF2IRD1 is subject to negative
autoregulation. All isoforms of mouse or human GTF2IRD1 bound 3
canonical GTF2IRD1-binding sites (GGATTA) in the region upstream of the
GTF2IRD1 gene. EMSA using artificial DNA probes and in vitro-translated
GTF2IRD1 revealed enhanced binding in the presence of 3 GGATTA sites and
dimerization of GTF2IRD1 proteins via an N-terminal leucine zipper
region. Binding by GTF2IRD1 repressed expression of a reporter gene.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Tassabehji et al. (1999) found that GTF3 was deleted in patients with
classic Williams syndrome, but not in patients with partial deletions
who had only supravalvular aortic stenosis. They suggested that
haploinsufficiency of the GTF3 gene may be the cause of the abnormal
muscle fatigability that is characteristic of Williams syndrome.

Tassabehji et al. (2005) reported a rare WBS individual with an atypical
deletion, including the GTF2IRD1 gene, showed facial dysmorphism and
cognitive deficits that differed from those of classic WBS cases. They
proposed a mechanism of cumulative dosage effects of duplicated and
diverged genes applicable to other human chromosomal disorders.

ANIMAL MODEL

Tassabehji et al. (2005) demonstrated that GTF2IRD1 is involved in
mammalian craniofacial and cognitive development. Gtf2ird1-null mice
exhibited phenotypic abnormalities reminiscent of the human
microdeletion disorder Williams-Beuren syndrome; craniofacial imaging
revealed abnormalities in both skull and jaws that may arise through
misregulation of goosecoid (138890), a downstream target of Gtf2ird1.

Palmer et al. (2010) found that mutant mice lacking Gtf2ird1 exon 2
expressed a mutant Gtf2ird1 transcript. The mutant transcript was
expressed at wildtype levels due to escape from nonsense mediated decay
and escape from negative autoregulation by Gtf2ird1 itself.

139265	TITLE *139265 GUANOSINE MONOPHOSPHATE REDUCTASE; GMPR
;;GUANOSINE MONOPHOSPHATE REDUCTASE 1; GMPR1;;
GMP REDUCTASE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Guanosine monophosphate reductase (EC 1.7.1.7) catalyzes the
irreversible NADPH-dependent reductive deamination of guanosine
monophosphate (GMP) to inosine monophosphate (IMP). GMPR is able to
convert guanosine nucleotides to the pivotal precursor of both guanine
(G) and adenine (A) nucleotides. It plays an important role in
maintaining the intracellular balance of A and G nucleotides.

CLONING

Beutler et al. (1990) and Mason et al. (1990) presented evidence that a
gene mapped to chromosome 6 by Kanno et al. (1989) was GMP reductase.
Henikoff and Smith (1989) had pointed out similarities between the
sequence described by Kanno et al. (1989) for the chromosome 6-encoded
gene and the sequence of E. coli GMP reductase. Kondoh et al. (1991)
found that the GMPR gene encodes a deduced 345-amino acid protein.

By Northern blot analysis, Deng et al. (2002) detected relatively high
levels of both GMPR1 and GMPR2 (610781) in heart, skeletal muscle, and
kidney, and relatively low levels of both in colon, thymus, and
peripheral blood leukocyte. Strong signals of GMPR2 were detected in
brain, liver, and placenta, whereas weak signals of GMPR1 were observed
in these tissues.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kondoh et al. (1991) determined that the GMPR gene spans about 50 kb and
contains 9 exons. The gene contains 2 potential Sp1 binding sites within
exon 1, and a functional, atypical polyadenylation signal in exon 9.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Murano et al. (1994) mapped the
GMPR gene to 6p23.

HISTORY

Kanno et al. (1989) suggested that red cell G6PD (305900) is a fusion
protein consisting of an NH2-terminus encoded by chromosome 6 and a
COOH-portion coded by an X chromosome. This was subsequently disproved
by Beutler et al. (1990) and by Mason et al. (1990).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
GMP REDUCTASE POLYMORPHISM
GMPR, PHE256ILE

Kondoh et al. (1991) identified a T-to-A substitution at nucleotide 766
of the GMPR gene resulting in substitution of isoleucine for
phenylalanine at amino acid residue 256 in the variant protein. The
frequency of the ile256 variant was thought to be about 30%. A silent
C-to-T change at codon 630 was also found, with a frequency of about
10%; the silent change created an additional restriction cleavage site.

605320	TITLE *605320 6-@PHOSPHOFRUCTO-2-KINASE/FRUCTOSE-2,6-BISPHOSPHATASE 4; PFKFB4
;;PFKFB, TESTIS
DESCRIPTION The bifunctional 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase (EC
2.7.1.105)/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (EC 3.1.3.46) (PFKFB) regulates
the steady-state concentration of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate, a potent
activator of a key regulatory enzyme of glycolysis, phosphofructokinase.
Isozymes of PFKFB differ in the regions surrounding the catalytic core,
which are important for the differential response to allosteric
effectors and hormonal signals in different tissues.

By screening a placental cDNA library with human and frog liver PFKFB
(PFKFB1; 311790) as probes, Sakai et al. (1996) obtained a partial cDNA
encoding PFKFB4, which they termed 2K-1. Manzano et al. (1999) isolated
a cDNA encoding PFKFB4 by screening a human testis cDNA library with a
rat liver Pfkfb probe, followed by RT-PCR. The predicted 469-amino acid
PFKFB4 protein, which is 97% homologous to the rat sequence and
approximately 70% identical to the human PFKFB isoforms, contains
multiple phosphorylation sites. Northern blot analysis of rat brain,
heart, liver, muscle, placenta, adipose tissue, ovary, fallopian tubes,
and testis with the human PFKFB4 sequence as probe detected
testis-specific expression of 2.4- and 3.3-kb transcripts. Western blot
analysis showed expression of a 55-kD protein, close to the predicted
value.

Manzano et al. (1999) mapped the PFKFB4 gene to 3p22-p21 by FISH.

;;PIX1;;
PROTEOME OF THE CENTRIOLE 1B
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

POC1A (614783) and POC1B localize to centrioles and related structures
and appear to play roles in centriole duplication and/or maintenance
(Keller et al., 2009).

CLONING

By searching a human database for sequences similar to Xenopus Pix1,
Hames et al. (2008) identified POC1B, which they called PIX1, and
obtained the full-length cDNA clone. The deduced 478-amino acid PIX1
protein contains an N-terminal WD40 domain predicted to fold into a
7-bladed beta propeller and a C-terminal coiled-coil domain. In Xenopus,
RT-PCR detected high expression of Pix1 in ovary, weaker expression in
testis, and very low expression in other tissues. Variable PIX1
expression was detected in all human cell lines examined. Hames et al.
(2008) also identified Xenopus and human PIX2 (POC1A) and 1 or 2 PIX
orthologs in rodents, zebrafish, Drosophila, and amphioxus, but not in
C. elegans or yeast. Immunohistochemical analysis detected Xenopus Pix1
in the single large mitochondrial cloud of previtellogenic oocytes.
Using an antibody that did not differentiate between human PIX proteins
for immunohistochemical analysis, Hames et al. (2008) found that PIX
associated with mitochondria, centrioles, and basal bodies in human cell
lines. Immunoelectron microscopic analysis of human RPE1 retinal pigment
epithelial cells revealed that PIX mostly associated with the central
region and distal end of the centriole barrel, with concentration within
the lumen. Epitope-tagged PIX1 and PIX2 were expressed in overlapping
but distinct patterns in mitochondria, centrosome, basal body, and
spindle microtubules during the cell cycle in transfected U2OS cells.
Western blot analysis of several human cell lines detected PIX1 at an
apparent molecular mass of about 54 kD.

Keller et al. (2009) found that fluorescence-tagged POC1A and POC1B
localized to both mother centrioles and newly forming daughter
centrioles in transfected HeLa and U2OS cells, a pattern of expression
that was also observed for Chlamydomonas Poc1.

GENE FUNCTION

Hames et al. (2008) found that epitope-tagged PIX2, and more weakly
PIX1, associated with microtubules in transfected HeLa cells. Inhibition
of PIX protein function via interfering antibodies disrupted cell
division in U2OS cells, resulting in a high proportion of cells that
were multinucleated or remained connected by a thin cytoplasmic bridge.

Keller et al. (2009) found that overexpression of fluorescence-tagged
POC1B in U2OS cells resulted in duplication of centrioles, which was
countered by small interfering RNA directed against POC1B or against
both POC1A and POC1B. Overexpression of POC1B also increased centriole
length in a significant proportion of transfected cells.

EVOLUTION

Keller et al. (2009) stated that all organisms with standard triplet
microtubule-containing centrioles in at least part of their life cycle
have a POC1 gene. In vertebrates, the POC1 gene is duplicated.

MAPPING

Hames et al. (2008) stated that the human POC1B gene maps to chromosome
12q21.33.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Ding et al. (2008) cloned KCTD1 from a human brain cDNA library. The
deduced 257-amino acid protein contains an N-terminal tetramerization
domain, which is a variant of a BTB-type protein-interaction domain, and
has a predicted molecular mass of 29.4 kD. Northern blot analysis
detected a major 2.0-kb transcript in mammary gland, kidney, brain, and
ovary. A minor 4.0-kb transcript was detected in mammary gland, kidney,
brain, ovary, and lung. KCTD1 expression was not detected in other
tissues. RT-PCR analysis detected KCTD1 in both normal breast and breast
carcinoma cell lines. Immunohistochemical analysis detected endogenous
KCTD1 protein in a punctate distribution in nuclei of HeLa cells and a
normal mammary epithelial cell line. Database analysis revealed that the
KCTD1 protein is highly conserved: the mouse Kctd1 protein is identical
to human KCTD1 except for an 8-amino acid insertion following the
initiating methionine, and the rat and human proteins are identical
except for 1 amino acid change.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ding et al. (2008) determined that the KCTD1 gene contains 7 exons and
spans about 185 kb, with exons 3 through 5 and part of exon 6 as coding
exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Ding et al. (2008) mapped the KCTD1 gene
to chromosome 18q11.2.

GENE FUNCTION

Ding et al. (2008) found that KCTD1 functioned as a transcriptional
repressor in a reporter gene assay following transfection of HEK293 and
NIH3T3 cells. Mutation analysis showed that the BTB domain of KCTD1
mediated transcriptional repression and did not require recruitment of
an HDAC1 (see 601241) complex. The BTB domain also functioned in KCTD1
dimerization.

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen, in vitro protein-interaction assays, and
immunoprecipitation analysis, Ding et al. (2009) showed that KCTD1
interacted with the transcription factor AP2-alpha (TFAP2A; 107580). The
yeast 2-hybrid screen also showed that KCTD1 interacted with AP2-beta
(TFAP2B; 601601) and AP2-gamma (TFAP2C; 601602). Cotransfection
experiments revealed that KCTD1 repressed the transcriptional activity
of these AP2 proteins, but showed strongest inhibition of AP2-alpha.
Mutation analysis revealed that the BTB domain of KCTD1 interacted with
the N-terminal activation domain of AP2-alpha. The BTB domain was also
required for the nuclear targeting of KCTD1 and for the nuclear
colocalization of KCTD1 and AP2-alpha in HeLa and normal mammary
epithelial cell lines.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected individuals from 10 unrelated families with scalp-ear-nipple
syndrome (SENS; 181270), Marneros et al. (2013) identified
heterozygosity for 10 different missense mutations in the KCTD1 gene
(see, e.g., 613420.0001-613420.0008). All 10 mutations were located at
highly conserved residues within BTB domains, segregated with disease in
the respective families, and were not found in more than 13,000
chromosomes of the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project.

606086	TITLE *606086 EUKARYOTIC TRANSLATION INITIATION FACTOR 5B; EIF5B
;;TRANSLATION INITIATION FACTOR IF2; IF2
DESCRIPTION Translation initiation requires the delivery of the initiator methionine
tRNA to the 40S ribosomal subunit. The initiator methionine tRNA is
delivered by the heterotrimeric complex EIF2 (see 603908) in a ternary
complex with GTP that interacts with the 40S subunit. The resulting
complex then binds to an mRNA and scans for the AUG start codon.

CLONING

By screening a brain cDNA library for cDNAs encoding proteins larger
than 50 kD, Nagase et al. (1998) isolated a cDNA encoding IF2, which
they called KIAA0741. They determined that the 1,220-amino acid protein
is 100% identical to a putative GTP-binding protein (GenBank GENBANK
AJ006412). RT-PCR analysis detected expression of KIAA0741 in all
tissues tested except spleen, with highest levels in brain, followed by
heart and testis.

By searching an EST database with the yeast IF2 protein as the probe,
followed by screening a testis cDNA library, Lee et al. (1999) isolated
a cDNA encoding human IF2. Sequence analysis predicted that the
1,220-amino acid human IF2 protein, which is 44% identical to the yeast
protein, contains 3 motifs characteristic of GTP-binding proteins and
has long N-terminal poly-glu and poly-lys stretches. The GTP-binding
domains of human IF2 share 70% and 54% identity with those of the yeast
and archaeal IF2 proteins, respectively. Northern blot analysis revealed
wide expression of a 4.5-kb IF2 transcript, with highest levels in
testis and skeletal muscle. Immunoblot analysis showed expression of a
175-kD protein. Functional analysis determined that human IF2 can
substitute for yeast IF2. Mutational analysis indicated that an intact
GTP-binding domain is required for translation promotion. Lee et al.
(1999) proposed that IF2 directs binding of met-tRNA to the ribosomal P
site.

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen on a T-cell cDNA library with the human
immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) matrix protein as bait, followed by
screening a HeLa cell cDNA library, Wilson et al. (1999) isolated a cDNA
encoding IF2. Immunoprecipitation and binding analyses indicated that
the C-terminal half of IF2, which is 53% identical to the C terminus of
yeast IF2, interacts with the HIV-1 matrix protein.

MAPPING

Nagase et al. (1998) stated that the EIF5B gene, which they termed
KIAA0741, maps to chromosome 2.

609951	TITLE *609951 ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 384; ZNF384
;;CAS-INTERACTING ZINC FINGER PROTEIN; CIZ;;
CAGH1;;
NUCLEAR MATRIX PROTEIN 4; NMP4
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ZNF384 is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein that localizes at
fibroblast focal adhesions, contains multiple zinc fingers, and
regulates expression of matrix metalloproteinases (e.g., MMP3; 185250)
(Thunyakitpisal et al., 2001).

CLONING

By screening adult and fetal human brain cDNA libraries for clones
containing CAG repeats, Margolis et al. (1997) isolated a partial cDNA
encoding ZNF384, which they called CAGH1.

By Far Western screening of a rat embryonic fibroblast cDNA library with
the SH3 domain of Cas (BCAR1; 602941) as probe, Nakamoto et al. (2000)
isolated several splice variants of Znf384, which they called Ciz. The
longest variant encodes a predicted 579-residue protein with an
N-terminal leucine zipper, multiple serine and proline residues, a
nuclear localization signal, 8 centrally located Kruppel-type C2H2 zinc
fingers, and C-terminal glutamine-alanine and glutamine repeat regions,
suggesting that Ciz may be a transcription factor. The shorter variants
encode proteins with only 5 or 6 zinc fingers. Northern blot analysis of
rat tissues revealed ubiquitous expression of a 3.0-kb transcript, with
highest levels in testis, heart, kidney, and brain. A 4.0-kb transcript
was also detected in brain, liver, and kidney. Immunofluorescence
microscopy showed that Ciz shuttled in and out of the nucleus and
localized at stably formed focal adhesions and in the nucleus.

Thunyakitpisal et al. (2001) independently cloned and characterized rat
Znf384, which they termed Nmp4, based on its interaction with type I
collagen alpha-1 (COL1A1; 120150). They identified several novel
variants, including one that lacks the C-terminal glutamine-alanine
repeat region.

GENE FUNCTION

Using precipitation analysis, Nakamoto et al. (2000) showed that rat Ciz
bound specifically and constitutively to the SH3 domain of Cas.
Immunoprecipitation and EMSA analysis demonstrated that Ciz bound to the
promoter of human MMP1 (120353) and upregulated transcription of human
MMP1 and MMP7 (178990) and rat Mmp3.

Thunyakitpisal et al. (2001) showed that rat Nmp4 interacted with Col1a1
and regulated its expression in osteoblasts. They concluded that NMP4
contributes to extracellular matrix turnover in bone and other tissues.

Shen et al. (2002) overexpressed Ciz in a mouse osteoblast cell line and
found that it inhibited Bmp2 (112261)-induced expression of alkaline
phosphatase (see ALPL; 171760), osteocalcin (BGLAP; 112260), type I
collagen, and Cbfa1 (RUNX2; 600211). They concluded that CIZ is an
inhibitory protein that modulates BMP2-induced differentiation of
osteoblastic cells.

MAPPING

Margolis et al. (1997) stated that the ZFN384 gene maps to chromosome
12p12. Alvarez et al. (2001) mapped the mouse Znf384 gene to chromosome
6F1, a region that shows homology of synteny to human chromosome 12p12.

ANIMAL MODEL

Morinobu et al. (2005) found that Ciz -/- mice had increased bone volume
and rates of bone formation, but no alteration in bone resorption. Ciz
-/- mice expressed higher levels of mRNA for proteins involved in
osteoblastic phenotypes, such as alkaline phosphatase and osterix (SP7;
606633). Ciz deficiency increased newly formed bone mass after femoral
bone marrow ablation, and it increased Bmp2-induced bone formation in
adult mouse calvariae. Morinobu et al. (2005) concluded that CIZ
suppresses the levels of adult bone mass through inhibition of
BMP-induced activation of osteoblasts.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Cytochrome P1-450 is the form of P-450 most closely associated with
polycyclic-hydrocarbon-induced aryl hydrocarbon hydrolase (AHH)
activity. Chen et al. (1983) cloned a portion of the genomic gene. The
compound 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) is a potent inducer
of many proteins including drug-metabolizing enzymes such as the
cytochrome P-450 proteins. The P1-450 that is induced by TCDD is the
same as AHH. Jaiswal et al. (1985) used a human cell line in which
treatment with TCDD resulted in high levels of AHH (P1-450) activity and
of human P1-450. Jaiswal et al. (1986) presented the complete amino acid
sequence of cytochrome P1-450, consisting of 515 residues.

Quattrochi et al. (1985) cloned human P450DX genes and concluded that
there are at least 2 in humans.

Jaiswal et al. (1985) and Kawajiri et al. (1986) isolated and analyzed
the complete nucleotide sequence of a human genomic clone highly
homologous to the rat cytochrome P-450 that is induced by
methylcholanthrene and TCDD.

Kawajiri et al. (1986) constructed a fusion gene by ligating the 5-prime
flanking region of the P-450c gene to the structural gene for
prokaryotic chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), expressed the CAT
activity in mouse cells in response to administered methylcholanthrene.
Thus, the isolated human gene was indeed one for methylcholanthrene
inducibility.

EVOLUTION

Jaiswal et al. (1985) estimated that the TCDD-inducible P-450 gene
family diverged from the phenobarbital-inducible P-450 gene family (see
122720) more than 200 million years ago. Nebert and Gonzalez (1987)
estimated that this divergence occurred more than 750 million years ago.

GENE STRUCTURE

By analysis of the common 5-prime flanking region shared by CYP1A1 and
CYP1A2, Corchero et al. (2001) demonstrated the presence of xenobiotic
response elements (XREs) previously reported for CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 and
several additional consensus sequences for putative XREs. The presence
of all the XREs upstream of both genes suggested that some of the
regulatory elements known to control CYP1A1 gene expression could also
control CYP1A2 gene expression.

GENE FUNCTION

Jaiswal et al. (1987) inserted various lengths of DNA upstream from the
human P1-450 gene into the promoterless pSVO-CAT prokaryotic expression
vector and compared with mouse P1-450 upstream sequences similarly
treated. The results were consistent with the presence of several
functional regulatory regions within the upstream DNA: a promoter
region, a region that is negatively autoregulated, and a region further
upstream that activates transcription and is dependent upon a functional
aromatic hydrocarbon receptor. Compared with 1,604 basepairs of human
P1-450 upstream sequences, 1,646 basepairs of mouse P1-450 upstream
sequences exhibited an increased sensitivity to TCDD; this effect was
found to require both trans-acting protein factors and cis-acting DNA
elements.

Thum and Borlak (2000) investigated the gene expression of major human
cytochrome P450 genes in various regions of explanted hearts from 6
patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and 1 with transposition of the
arterial trunk and 2 samples of normal heart. mRNA for cytochrome 1A1
was predominantly expressed in the right ventricle. A strong correlation
between tissue-specific gene expression and enzyme activity was found.
Thum and Borlak (2000) concluded that their findings showed that
expression of genes for cytochrome P450 monooxgenases and verapamil
metabolism are found predominantly in the right side of the heart, and
suggested that this observation may explain the lack of efficacy of
certain cardioselective drugs.

MAPPING

Hildebrand et al. (1985) used a full-length cDNA for human
2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD)-inducible cytochrome P1-450
to study DNA from somatic hybrid cells. They assigned the gene to
chromosome 15. Jaiswal and Nebert (1986) indicated that this locus is in
the 15q22-qter segment, near MPI (154550). The P3-450 gene (CYP1A2) has
also been located on chromosome 15; see 124060. See also CYP1B1
(601771).

Corchero et al. (2001) found that the CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 genes are
separated by a 23-kb segment that contains no other open reading frames.
They are in opposite orientation, revealing that they share a common
5-prime flanking region.

Hildebrand et al. (1985) showed that in the mouse, which has 2
dioxin-inducible P-450 genes, P1-450 and P3-450, the 2 genes are
situated in the middle portion of chromosome 9 near the Mpi-1 locus,
between Thy-1 and Pk-3. Treatment of mice with polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons results in induction of P1-450 and P3-450. The mouse P1-450
and P3-450 genes have been cloned and shown to be coordinately regulated
by the cytosolic receptor which is coded by the Ah locus and
specifically binds the inducing chemicals.

By Southern blot analysis of DNA from hamster-mouse somatic cell
hybrids, Tukey et al. (1984) demonstrated that the genes for P1-450 and
P3-450 map to chromosome 9 in the mouse. The major regulatory gene
controlling P1-450 induction in the mouse is located in the centromeric
region of chromosome 12. Mouse chromosome 9 shows other homology of
synteny with human 15.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Kouri et al. (1982) reported that individuals with the high-inducibility
phenotype (present in approximately 10% of the human population) might
be at greater risk than low-inducibility individuals for cigarette
smoke-induced bronchogenic carcinoma. In a 3-generation family of 15
individuals, Petersen et al. (1991) showed that the
high-CYP1A1-inducibility phenotype segregated concordantly with an
infrequent polymorphic site located 450 bases downstream from the CYP1A1
gene. These findings were consistent with those of Kawajiri et al.
(1986, 1990), who demonstrated an association between this polymorphism
and an increased incidence of squamous cell lung cancer. Polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) generated from the combustion of fossil
fuels, and aromatic amines, which are present in cigarette smoke and
other environmental media, present 2 classic environmental carcinogens.

Perera (1997) reviewed evidence on variation in susceptibility to the
effects of carcinogens. CYP1A1 encodes a phase I cytochrome P450 enzyme
that metabolizes PAHs such as benzo[a]pyrene (BP). About 10% of
Caucasians have a highly inducible form of the enzyme that is associated
with an increased risk of lung cancer in smokers. Although not all
studies have been positive, in Japanese and certain Caucasian
populations, increased lung cancer risk was correlated with 1 or both
CYP1A1 polymorphisms: the so-called MSPI polymorphism and the
closely-linked exon 7 (isoleucine-valine) polymorphism (Kawajiri et al.,
1996; Nakachi et al., 1991; Xu et al., 1996). The greatest incremental
lung cancer risk from the 'susceptible' CYP1A1 genotype was seen in
light smokers (7 times the risk of light smokers without the genotype),
whereas heavy smokers with this genotype had less than twice the risk of
heavy smokers without the genotype. The proposed mechanism for the
increased risk is higher CYP1A1 inducibility or enhanced catalytic
activity of the valine-type CYP1A1 enzyme. Consistent with these
mechanisms, Mooney et al. (1997) found that U. S. smoking volunteers
with the exon 7 mutation had more PAH-DNA adducts in their white blood
cells than did smokers without the variant. Perera (1997) stated that
PAH-DNA adducts were also elevated in cord blood and placenta of
newborns with the CYP1A1 MSP1 polymorphism, which suggested that the
genetic polymorphism may increase risk from transplacental PAH exposure.
In lung tissue of adults, adduct concentration correlated with CYP1A1
expression or enzyme activity. Perera (1997) noted that lung tumors of
Japanese smokers were found to be significantly more likely to have p53
(191170) mutations if they had the susceptible CYP1A1 genotype. A
failure to demonstrate genetic susceptibility through CYP1A1
polymorphism when exposure to the environmental carcinogen is heavy is
observed with some other polymorphisms and carcinogenic exposures. It is
possible that at higher exposures, the effects of the genetic traits are
overwhelmed by the environmental insults.

Numerous studies have shown that maternal cigarette smoking during
pregnancy is associated with reduced birth weight and increased risk of
low birth weight, defined as weight less than 2,500 g. Maternal
cigarette smoking has thus been identified as the single largest
modifiable risk factor for intrauterine growth restriction in developed
countries. However, not all women who smoke cigarettes during pregnancy
have low-birth weight infants. Wang et al. (2002) studied whether the
association between maternal cigarette smoking and infant birth weight
differs by polymorphisms of 2 maternal metabolic genes: CYP1A1 and GSTT1
(600436). The CYP1A1 polymorphism was the Msp1 polymorphism (AA vs Aa
and aa); the GSTT1 polymorphism was present versus absent. Wang et al.
(2002) found that regardless of genotype, continuous maternal smoking
during pregnancy was associated with a mean reduction of 377 g in birth
weight. They found that for the CYP1A1 genotype, the estimated reduction
in birth weight was 252 g for the AA genotype group, but was 520 g for
the Aa/aa genotype group. For the GSTT1 genotype, they found the
estimated reduction in birth weight was 285 g and 642 g for the present
and absent genotype groups, respectively. When both CYP1A1 and GSTT1
genotypes were considered, Wang et al. (2002) found the greatest
reduction in birth weight among smoking mothers with the CYP1A1 Aa/aa
and GSTT1 absent genotypes. Among mothers who had not smoked during
their pregnancy or during the 3 months prior to their pregnancy,
genotype did not independently confer an adverse effect.

The CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 genes are oriented head-to-head on human
chromosome 15; the 23.3-kb spacer region might contain distinct
regulatory regions for one or the other of these genes, or the
regulatory regions for the 2 genes may overlap one another. From 24
unrelated subjects of 5 major, geographically isolated subgroups, Jiang
et al. (2005) resequenced both genes (all exons and all introns) plus
some 3-prime flanking sequences and the entire spacer region (39.6 kb
total). They identified 85 SNPs, 49 of which were not in the NCBI
database. SNP typing in 94 Africans, 96 Asians, and 83 Caucasians
demonstrated striking ethnic differences in SNP frequencies and
haplotype evolution. To demonstrate functionality, they generated a
'humanized' BAC transgenic mouse line, having an absence of the mouse
orthologous Cyp1a1 or Cyp1a2 genes, that expressed human CYP1A1 and
CYP1A2 mRNA, protein, and enzyme activity in a tissue-specific manner
similar to that of the mouse.

ANIMAL MODEL

Jones et al. (1991) coupled a DNA fragment containing the murine Cyp1a-1
enhancer elements and promoter region to the chloramphenicol
acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene and used it to create transgenic
mice. Treatment with 3-methylcholanthrene increased hepatic expression
levels by as much as 10,000-fold. Differences in the response to
induction between male and female mice suggested that Cyp1a-1 expression
may be governed in a gender-related manner.

Paolini et al. (1999) found significant increases in the
carcinogen-metabolizing enzymes CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP3A (124010), CYP2B
(123930), and CYP2A in the lungs of rats supplemented with high doses of
beta-carotene. The authors suggested that correspondingly high levels of
CYPs in humans would predispose an individual to cancer risk from the
widely bioactivated tobacco-smoke procarcinogens, thus explaining the
cocarcinogenic effect of beta-carotene in smokers.

NOMENCLATURE

The nomenclature and symbolization of the P450 enzymes and their genes
have gone through many changes. The currently preferred system (Nebert,
1988) uses the symbol CYP followed by a number for family and a letter
for subfamily. CYP1 is the designation of the family of P450 genes
located on human chromosome 15 and mouse chromosome 9. (CYP1 was
previously used for a P450 gene on chromosome 19 (122720), which is now
called CYP2.) The number assigned to the family is sometimes arbitrary
or selected for reasons of historical priority; in other cases it has
specific significance, e.g., in the case of CYP21 on 6p and CYP17 on 10,
which are genes for the enzymes of classes designated P450XXI (steroid
21-hydroxylase) and P450XVII (steroid 17-alpha-hydroxylase),
respectively.

HISTORY

From study of mouse-human hybrid cells, Brown et al. (1976) concluded
that a structural gene for AHH is on chromosome 2 and that possibly a
regulatory gene is there also. Ocraft et al. (1985) localized the gene
to 2q31-2pter. According to McBride (1985), the gene mapped to
chromosome 2 by expression assays is almost certainly not the structural
locus; the structural locus is that assigned to chromosome 15:
dioxin-inducible P1-450. Nebert (1988) recommended that the AHH locus
held to be on chromosome 2 be removed from that listing. The assignment
was based on measurements of AHH inducibility in tissue culture, and
effects of dibutyryl cAMP or other factor on the enzyme activity might
have been observed. Neither the Ah receptor nor the P(1)450 or P(3)450
genes that it regulates map to chromosome 2 or to its mouse or hamster
homolog.

The chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) assay system for monitoring
gene expression was reported by Gorman et al. (1983). Gorman (1993)
described the circumstances surrounding the development of the method.
The initial report was turned down by the journal Nature, whose
editorial staff charged that the work was not of wide enough interest
for publication there.

603863	TITLE *603863 RING FINGER PROTEIN 7; RNF7
;;REGULATOR OF CULLINS 2; ROC2;;
RBX2;;
SENSITIVE TO APOPTOSIS GENE; SAG
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Reactive oxygen species (ROS), a group of very reactive, short-lived
chemicals produced during normal respiratory processes or after
oxidative insults, may mediate apoptosis. Metal chelators and metal ions
are redox-sensitive agents that can mediate ROS generation. The metal
chelator 1,10-phenanthroline (OP) induces or suppresses apoptosis in a
cell line-dependent manner. Using differential display, Duan et al.
(1999) isolated mouse cDNAs associated with OP-induced apoptosis. One
cDNA encoded Gss (601002), and the other encoded a novel protein
produced by a gene that they designated Sag. The authors used the mouse
Sag cDNA to identify a HeLa cell cDNA corresponding to human SAG. The
predicted 113-amino acid human SAG protein is 97% identical to mouse
Sag. The C-terminal half of SAG consists of a zinc RING finger domain.
Northern blot analysis revealed that SAG was ubiquitously expressed,
with the highest levels in heart, skeletal muscle, and testis.
Immunofluorescent staining indicated that SAG localized in both the
cytoplasm and nuclei of mammalian cells.

By searching databases for homologs of ROC1 (RBX1; 603814), followed by
PCR of a HeLa cell cDNA library, Ohta et al. (1999) cloned RNF7, which
they called ROC2. The deduced 85-amino acid ROC2 protein shares 51%
identity with ROC1 and 35% identity with human APC11 (ANAPC11; 614534),
a subunit of the anaphase-promoting complex. Both ROC proteins are
highly evolutionarily conserved. ROC1 and ROC2 both contain a RING
finger domain and are rich in tryptophan.

GENE FUNCTION

Duan et al. (1999) found that, in vitro, recombinant human SAG bound to
zinc and copper metal ions and prevented lipid peroxidation induced by
copper or a free radical generator. When overexpressed in human cell
lines, SAG protected cells from apoptosis induced by redox agents such
as OP. Duan et al. (1999) concluded that SAG is a cellular protective
molecule that appears to act as an antioxidant to inhibit apoptosis
induced by metal ions and ROS.

By yeast 2-hybrid and immunoprecipitation analyses, Ohta et al. (1999)
found that human ROC1 and ROC2 commonly interacted with all cullins (see
603134). They concluded that combinations of ROC/APC11 and cullin
proteins potentially constitute a wide variety of ubiquitin ligases.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Duan et al. (1999) mapped the SAG
gene to chromosome 3q22-q24.

180662	TITLE *180662 POLYMERASE II, RNA, SUBUNIT I; POLR2I
;;RPB9, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF;;
RNA POLYMERASE II, 14.5-KD SUBUNIT
DESCRIPTION In eukaryotic cells, transcription of genes encoding mRNAs is effected
by RNA polymerase II, in combination with a number of cofactors that
control the selectivity and/or efficiency of transcription initiation,
elongation, and termination. Depending on its origin, RNA polymerase II
is found to consist of 10 to 14 polypeptides ranging from 220 to 10 kD.
For general information on the structure and function of RNA polymerase
II, see POLR2A (180660).

CLONING

The cDNA of the largest subunit of human RNA polymerase II (POLR2A)
codes for a polypeptide of average molecular mass 220 kD. The second
largest subunit (POLR2B; 180661) has a molecular mass of about 140 kD.
Acker et al. (1993) reported the genomic sequence for a human subunit
homologous to RPB9 in yeast. The POLR2I gene is transcribed into 3 major
RNA species. The corresponding mRNAs contain the same open reading frame
encoding a 125-amino acid residue protein, with a calculated molecular
mass of 14,523 daltons.

GENE STRUCTURE

Acker et al. (1993) found that the POLR2I gene consists of 6 exons,
ranging from 52 to over 110 bp.

GENE FUNCTION

Yeast cells lacking RPB9 are unable to grow at high and low temperatures
and are defective in mRNA start site selection. McKune et al. (1995)
found that expression of POLR2I on a high copy number plasmid, but not
on a low copy number plasmid, restored growth at high temperatures.
Recombinant POLR2I was also able to correct the start site selection
defect seen at the CYC1 promoter in vitro as effectively as the yeast
RPB9 subunit.

MAPPING

By in situ hybridization, Acker et al. (1994) assigned the POLR2I gene
to chromosome 19q12.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Cramer et al. (2000) derived a backbone model of a 10-subunit yeast RNA
polymerase II using x-ray diffraction data extending to 3-angstrom
resolution. All 10 subunits exhibited a high degree of identity with the
corresponding human proteins, and 9 of the 10 subunits are conserved
among the 3 eukaryotic RNA polymerases I, II, and III. Notable features
of the model include a pair of jaws, formed by subunits Rpb1 (180660),
Rpb5 (180664), and Rpb9, that appears to grip DNA downstream of the
active center. A clamp on the DNA nearer the active center, formed by
Rpb1, Rpb2 (180661), and Rpb6 (604414), may be locked in the closed
position by RNA, accounting for the great stability of transcribing
complexes. A pore in the protein complex beneath the active center may
allow entry of substrates for polymerization and exit of the transcript
during proofreading and passage through pause sites in the DNA.

614283	TITLE *614283 GLUCOCORTICOID-INDUCED TRANSCRIPT 1; GLCCI1
;;THYMOCYTE/SPERMATOCYTE SELECTION 1; TSSN1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Miazek and Malissen (2003) cloned mouse Glcci1, and by database
analysis, they identified human GLCCI1. The deduced mouse and human
proteins contain 537 and 546 amino acids, respectively, and they share
94% identity.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Miazek and Malissen (2003) mapped the
GLCCI1 gene to chromosome 7p22. They mapped the mouse Glcci1 gene to a
syntenic region of chromosome 6A1-A2 by FISH.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Glucocorticoid Therapy Response

For a discussion of glucocorticoid response in asthma regulated by
variation in the GLCCI1 gene, see 614400.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
GLUCOCORTICOID THERAPY, RESPONSE TO
GLCCI1, -1106A-G (dbSNP rs37973)

In a genomewide association study to discover novel pharmacogenetic
determinants of the response to inhaled glucocorticoids among asthma
patients, Tantisira et al. (2011) identified a functional SNP in the
GLCCI1 gene, dbSNP rs37973, which was in complete linkage disequilibrium
with another SNP, dbSNP rs37972, associated with decreased response to
glucocorticoid therapy (GCTR; 614400). The SNP dbSNP rs37973
significantly decreased GLCCI1 expression in a luciferase reporter
assay. The mean increase in forced expiratory volume in 1 second in the
treated subjects who were homozygous for the mutant (G) dbSNP rs37973
allele was only about one-third of that seen in similarly treated
subjects who were homozygous for the wildtype allele (A) (3.2 +/- 1.6%
vs 9.4 +/- 1.1%), and their risk of a poor response was significantly
higher (odds ratio, 2.36; 95% confidence interval, 1.27 to 4.41), with
genotype accounting for about 6.6% of overall inhaled glucocorticoid
response variability.

611592	TITLE *611592 PHENYLALANYL-tRNA SYNTHETASE 2, MITOCHONDRIAL; FARS2
;;FARS1;;
MITOCHONDRIAL PHERS
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are enzymes that catalyze attachment of amino
acids to their cognate tRNAs. Phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase (PheRS) is a
member of the class II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (Bullard et al.,
1999).

CLONING

By screening a human EST database with consensus sequences derived from
the conserved regions of the alpha and beta subunits of bacterial PheRS,
Bullard et al. (1999) identified 2 partial FARS2 clones. Sequence
analysis determined that 1 clone was a truncated form of the other and
that human FARS2 consisted of a single polypeptide chain. The deduced
451-amino acid FARS2 protein has a predicted molecular mass of 49.6 kD
and an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting signal. FARS2 shares 42% and
52% amino acid identity with yeast and Drosophila mitochondrial PheRS,
respectively, and has no significant homology to the eukaryotic
cytoplasmic form (see FARSA; 602918). FARS2 migrated as a 48-kD band by
SDS-PAGE, and gel filtration and velocity sedimentation centrifugation
analysis determined that FARS2 is active as a monomer.

GENE FUNCTION

By aminoacylation assay analysis with expressed tagged-FARS2 in E. coli,
Bullard et al. (1999) showed that FARS2 can charge tRNA with
phenylalanine, but at a rate 20- to 30-fold lower than that of yeast
cytoplasmic PheRS. By analyzing FARS2 activity under varying
concentrations of ATP, they demonstrated that human mitochondrial PheRS
requires a high concentration of ATP for maximal activity.

GENE STRUCTURE

Bonnefond et al. (2005) determined that the FARS2 gene contains 6 exons
and spans 403 kb.

Elo et al. (2012) stated that the FARS2 gene contains 7 exons, of which
exons 2-7 are protein-coding.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the FARS2
gene to chromosome 6 (TMAP RH46741).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 3 sibs, born of consanguineous Saudi Arabian parents, with combined
oxidative phosphorylation deficiency-14 (COXPD14; 614946), Shamseldin et
al. (2012) identified a homozygous mutation in the FARS2 gene (Y144C;
611592.0001). The mutation was identified by exome sequencing and
confirmed by Sanger sequencing.

By exome sequencing of 2 sibs with combined oxidative phosphorylation
deficiency manifest as fatal infantile epileptic mitochondrial
encephalopathy, Elo et al. (2012) identified compound heterozygosity for
2 missense mutations in the FARS2 gene (I329T, 611592.0002; D391V,
611592.0003). In vitro functional expression studies indicated that
these mutations, and the Y144C mutation reported by Shamseldin et al.
(2012), all resulted in impaired aminoacylation function and stability
of the protein, causing an overall decrease in tRNA charging capacity.
The findings indicated that FARS2 mutations cause a mitochondrial
translation disorder. The phenotype in all 3 patients was characterized
by infantile onset of a fatal encephalopathy with refractory seizures,
lack of psychomotor development, and lactic acidosis.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001

FARS2, TYR144CYS

In 2 sibs, born of consanguineous Saudi Arabian parents, with combined
oxidative phosphorylation deficiency-14 (COXPD14; 614946), Shamseldin et
al. (2012) identified a homozygous 431A-G transition in the FARS2 gene,
resulting in a tyr144-to-cys (Y144C) substitution at a highly conserved
residue in the catalytic domain. The mutation, which was found by exome
sequencing and confirmed by Sanger sequencing, was not found in 114
Saudi controls.

Elo et al. (2012) found that the Y144C mutation occurs in the
aminoacylation domain on the interface of the anticodon stem-binding
domain and may participate in stabilization of the closed structure. In
vitro functional expression studies in E. coli indicated that the
mutation resulted in decreased affinity for tRNA, causing a decrease in
overall tRNA charging capacity.

COMBINED OXIDATIVE PHOSPHORYLATION DEFICIENCY 14
FARS2, ILE329THR

In 2 Finnish sibs with COXPD14 (614946), Elo et al. (2012) identified
compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the FARS2 gene: a 986T-C
transition in exon 5 resulting in an ile329-to-thr (I329T) substitution,
and a 1172A-T transversion in exon 6 resulting in an asp391-to-val
(D391V; 611592.0003) substitution. Each unaffected parent was
heterozygous for 1 of the mutations, neither of which was found in 400
Finnish control chromosomes or in the 1000 Genomes database. Both
mutations occurred at highly conserved residues. The ile329 residue is
part of the ATP-binding site in the aminoacylation domain, whereas
asp391 is in the anticodon stem-binding domain. In vitro functional
expression studies in E. coli indicated that the I329T mutation resulted
in a 4-fold decrease in the catalytic activity of amino acid activation
due to a decreased affinity for ATP. The D391V mutation was predicted to
result in a decrease in phe binding, causing a decrease in
aminoacylation activity. Both mutations also caused decreased
stabilization of the proteins, resulting in a decrease in overall
charging capacity.

612668	TITLE *612668 TASTE RECEPTOR, TYPE 2, MEMBER 43; TAS2R43
;;T2R52
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TAS2R43 belongs to the large TAS2R receptor family. TAS2Rs are expressed
on the surface of taste receptor cells and mediate the perception of
bitterness through a G protein-coupled second messenger pathway (Conte
et al., 2002). For further information on TAS2Rs, see 604791.

CLONING

By screening the human genome for sequences related to TAS2Rs, Conte et
al. (2002) cloned TAS2R43, which they called T2R52. The deduced
309-amino acid protein contains the 7-transmembrane structure and short
N- and C-terminal domains conserved in TAS2Rs. The intracellular domains
share significant conservation with other TAS2R family members. TAS2R43
shares highest sequence similarity with TAS2R44 (602669).

By in situ hybridization, Kuhn et al. (2004) confirmed the presence of
TAS2R43 on human circumvallate papilla.

GENE FUNCTION

Using human embryonic kidney cells transfected with an experimental
construct that coupled activation of TAS2R43 or TAS2R44 to measurable
Ca(2+) release from intracellular stores, Kuhn et al. (2004) showed that
both receptors responded to a subset of bitter-tasting compounds. Both
receptors were activated by the sulfonyl amide sweeteners, saccharine
and acesulfame K, although TAS2R43 showed a weaker response. Both
receptors were highly sensitive to aristolochic acid, a purely
bitter-tasting compound, and neither was activated by compounds
eliciting sweet or umami taste. Consistent with the in vitro data,
cross-adaptation studies in human subjects supported the existence of
common receptors for both sulfonyl amide sweeteners. Kuhn et al. (2004)
concluded that TAS2R43 and TAS2R44 could contribute to the bitter
aftertaste of saccharine and acesulfame K.

Shah et al. (2009) found that motile cilia emerging from human airway
epithelial cells express sensory bitter taste receptors, including T2R4
(604869), T2R43, T2R38 (607751), and T2R46 (612774). Only ciliated
epithelial cells expressed these receptors, and they specifically
localized in cilia. The receptors appeared to localize preferentially at
different places along the cilium. T2R4 seemed to sit near the tips of
cilia, whereas T2R43 appeared to reside more proximally. Bitter
compounds increased the intracellular calcium ion concentration and
stimulated ciliary beat frequency. Shah et al. (2009) found that
alpha-gustducin (139395) and the enzyme phospholipase C-beta-2 (PLCB2;
604114) are also expressed in airway epithelia. Alpha-gustducin resides
in the cilia, and PLCB2 appears to sit below the cilia in the apical
portion of the cell. Shah et al. (2009) concluded that airway epithelia
contain a cell-autonomous system in which motile cilia both sense
noxious substances entering airways and initiate a defensive mechanism
to eliminate the offending compound. Hence, like primary cilia,
classical motile cilia also contain sensors to detect the external
environment.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid and genomic sequence analysis, Conte et al.
(2002) mapped the TAS2R43 gene to a 1.2-Mb TAS2R gene cluster on
chromosome 12p.

609591	TITLE *609591 RIC-LIKE PROTEIN WITHOUT CAAX MOTIF 1; RIT1
;;RAS-LIKE PROTEIN EXPRESSED IN MANY TISSUES; RIT;;
ROC1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

RIT belongs to the RAS (HRAS; 190020) subfamily of small GTPases (Hynds
et al., 2003).

CLONING

By PCR using degenerate primers based on the conserved G3 and G4 domains
of RAS, followed by screening a mouse retina cDNA library, Lee et al.
(1996) cloned mouse Rit. The deduced 219-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 25.6 kD. By EST database analysis, Lee et
al. (1996) identified human RIT. The deduced human protein contains 219
amino acids and shares 94% identity with mouse Rit. Human and mouse RIT
have 5 highly conserved domains characteristic of small G proteins, but
they lack the C-terminal CAAX prenylation motif found in several other
RAS-like proteins. Northern blot analysis detected a 1.2-kb transcript
in all mouse tissues examined. Epitope-tagged mouse Rit localized to the
plasma membrane of transfected cells.

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to Drosophila Ric,
Wes et al. (1996) identified human RIT and RIN (609592). The core GTPase
domain of RIT shares 76% identity with that of RIN, and there is only 1
conservative substitution between the 2 human proteins and Drosophila
Ric within the effector G2 region. Northern blot analysis detected RIT
transcripts of 1.35, 2.9, and 3.9 kb in most tissues examined.

GENE FUNCTION

Lee et al. (1996) demonstrated that mouse Rit bound radiolabeled GTP.

Shao et al. (1999) demonstrated that recombinant human RIT and RIN bound
GTP and exhibited intrinsic GTPase activity. Conversion of gln79 to leu
in RIT resulted in complete loss of GTPase activity. The activity of RIT
and RIN was significantly different from that of the majority of
RAS-related GTPases, and the GTP dissociation rates were 5- to 10-fold
faster than most RAS-like GTPases. Yeast 2-hybrid analysis showed that
RIT and RIN interacted with the RAS-binding proteins RALGDS (601619),
RLF (180610), and AF6 (MLLT4; 159559), but not with RAF kinases (e.g.,
RAF1; 164760), RIN1 (605965), or the p110 subunit of PI3K (see 171834).
Shao et al. (1999) concluded that RIT and RIN regulate signaling
pathways and cellular processes distinct from those controlled by RAS.

By expression of RIT in a human neuroblastoma cell line, Hynds et al.
(2003) demonstrated that RIT increased neurite outgrowth and branching
through MEK (see MEK1; 176872)-dependent and MEK-independent signaling
mechanisms, respectively. Adenoviral expression of wildtype or
constitutively active RIT increased neurite initiation, elongation, and
branching on endogenous matrix or a purified laminin-1 substratum. This
outgrowth was morphologically distinct from that promoted by
constitutively active RAS or RAF. Constitutively active RIT increased
phosphorylation of ERK1 (MAPK3; 601795)/ERK2 (MAPK1; 176948), but not
AKT (see AKT1; 164730). A MEK inhibitor blocked RIT-induced neurite
initiation, but not elongation or branching.

Shi and Andres (2005) found that stimulation of a rat pheochromocytoma
cell line by growth factors, including nerve growth factor (NGF;
162030), resulted in rapid and prolonged Rit activation. Ectopic
expression of active human RIT promoted neurite outgrowth and stimulated
activation of both Erk and p38 MAP kinase (MAPK14; 600289) signaling
pathways. RIT-induced differentiation depended upon both MAP kinase
cascades, since MEK inhibition blocked RIT-induced neurite outgrowth,
and p38 blockade inhibited neurite elongation and branching, but not
neurite initiation. Moreover, the ability of NGF to promote neuronal
differentiation was attenuated by Rit knockdown.

Heo et al. (2006) surveyed plasma membrane targeting mechanisms by
imaging the subcellular localization of 125 fluorescent
protein-conjugated Ras, Rab, Arf, and Rho proteins. Of 48 proteins that
were localized to the plasma membrane, 37 contained clusters of
positively charged amino acids. To test whether these polybasic clusters
bind negatively charged phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate lipids,
Heo et al. (2006) developed a chemical phosphatase activation method to
deplete plasma membrane phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate.
Unexpectedly, proteins with polybasic clusters dissociated from the
plasma membrane only when both phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and
phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate were depleted, arguing that
both lipid second messengers jointly regulate plasma membrane targeting.

MAPPING

Wes et al. (1996) stated that the RIT gene was mapped to chromosome 1 by
somatic cell hybrid analysis. The mouse Rit gene maps to chromosome 3.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 17 unrelated patients with Noonan syndrome-8 (NS8; 615355), Aoki et
al. (2013) identified heterozygous mutations in the RIT1 gene (see,
e.g., 609591.0001-609591.0004). The first mutations were found by exome
sequencing and subsequent mutations were identified from a larger cohort
of patients screened for the RIT1 gene. A total of 9 missense mutations
were found in 17 (9%) of 180 individuals suspected to have the disorder.
The phenotype was characterized by short stature, distinctive facial
features, and a high incidence of congenital heart defects and
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. A subset of patients showed intellectual
disabilities. All of the mutations occurred de novo, except in 1 patient
who inherited the mutation from a mother with a Noonan syndrome
phenotype. The mutations tended to cluster in the switch II region, and
in vitro functional expression studies of 3 of the mutations showed that
they resulted in a gain of function. Transfection of 2 of the mutations
into zebrafish embryos resulted in a variety of developmental defects,
including gastrulation defects, craniofacial abnormalities, pericardial
edema, and elongated yolk sac. A smaller percentage of mutant embryos
showed even more disorganized growth and abnormal cardiogenesis. The
findings were similar to those observed with mutations in other RAS
genes (see, e.g., PTPN11, 176876; SOS1, 182530; NRAS, 164790) causing
other forms of Noonan syndrome.

;;EQUILIBRATIVE NUCLEOSIDE TRANSPORTER 2; ENT2;;
HYDROPHOBIC NUCLEOLAR PROTEIN, 36-KD; HNP36;;
DELAYED-EARLY RESPONSE GENE 12; DER12
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The uptake of nucleosides by transporters, such as SLC29A2, is essential
for nucleotide synthesis by salvage pathways in cells that lack de novo
biosynthetic pathways. Nucleoside transport also plays a key role in the
regulation of many physiologic processes through its effect on adenosine
concentration at the cell surface (Griffiths et al., 1997).

CLONING

Transcription of delayed-early response (DER) genes is induced by
immediate-early response (IER) genes following serum or growth factor
stimulation of cells. Williams and Lanahan (1995) reported the cloning
of a DER gene that they termed HNP36. They isolated a full-length cDNA
from a human heart cDNA library and found that it predicted a 326-amino
acid protein. This predicted protein is 50% similar to the C-terminal
331 amino acids of the yeast protein FUN26. Using immunocytochemistry,
Williams and Lanahan (1995) found that HNP36 localized specifically to
the nucleolus of fibroblasts and was more prominent in serum-stimulated
cells. Northern blot analysis showed that HNP36 is a DER gene; the mRNA
was barely detectable in quiescent fibroblasts, but was prominent
approximately 5 hours after stimulation with serum or growth factors.

By Northern blot analysis, Williams et al. (1997) showed that HNP36 was
expressed as a single 2.4-kb transcript in all adult human tissues
examined. RT-PCR revealed several bands smaller than the predicted size;
these bonds had deletions of specific exons and may correspond to
alternatively spliced transcripts.

By PCR of a human placenta cDNA library, Griffiths et al. (1997) cloned
full-length SLC29A2, which they called ENT2. The nucleotide sequences of
ENT2 and HNP36 are identical except for a 68-nucleotide insertion in
ENT2 following nucleotide 337 of HNP36. The deduced 456-amino acid ENT2
protein has a calculated molecular mass of 50.2 kD and shares 46% amino
acid identity with ENT1 (SLC29A1; 602193). It has 11 transmembrane (TM)
domains connected to one another by hydrophilic loops. Most of the loops
are small, except for 2 large loops connecting TM domains 1 and 2 and TM
domains 6 and 7. The loop connecting TM domains 1 and 2 has 2 potential
N-glycosylation sites. EST database analysis indicated that ENT2 mRNA is
expressed in adult ovary and ovarian tumors and in fetal brain and
heart.

Crawford et al. (1998) determined that the ENT2 transcript contains 2
potential ORFs. HNP36 is translated from the second start codon and
lacks TM domains 1, 2, and 3 compared with full-length ENT2. Northern
blot analysis detected high expression of a major 2.6-kb transcript in
skeletal muscle, with lower expression in most other tissues examined. A
transcript of about 4 kb was also detected in thymus, prostate, heart,
brain, lung, skeletal muscle, and pancreas.

GENE FUNCTION

Griffiths et al. (1997) found that both ENT1 and ENT2 showed saturable
sodium-independent equilibrative transport of adenosine and uridine
following expression in Xenopus oocytes. ENT1 was more efficient than
ENT2 in transport of both substrates, and ENT1, but not ENT2, was
sensitive to inhibition by nitrobenzylmercaptopurine riboside (NBMPR).

Crawford et al. (1998) showed that only full-length ENT2, and not HNP36,
conferred uridine transport in transfected COS-1 cells.

Ward et al. (2000) found that human ENT2 showed lower affinity than ENT1
for transport of thymidine, adenosine, cytidine, and guanosine following
expression in porcine kidney cells. However, ENT2 showed 4-fold higher
affinity than ENT1 for inosine. The nucleobase hypoxanthine inhibited
uridine uptake by ENT2, but had minimal effect on ENT1. Ward et al.
(2000) concluded that ENT2 may be the major transporter of adenosine and
its metabolites (inosine and hypoxanthine) in tissues where ENT2 is
predominantly expressed, such as skeletal muscle.

Yao et al. (2001) expressed rat and human ENT1 and ENT2 in Xenopus
oocytes and characterized their ability to transport three
3-prime-deoxy-nucleoside analogs used in human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV) therapy: 2-prime,3-prime-did eoxycytidine (ddC),
3-prime-azido-3-prime-deoxythymidine (AZT), and
2-prime,3-prime-dideoxyinosine (ddI). Rat and human ENT2 transported
ddC, AZT, and ddI, whereas rat and human ENT1 transported ddC and ddI
only. Relative to uridine, ENT2 mediated substantially larger fluxes of
ddC and ddI compared with ENT1. Fusion of the N-terminal half of rat
Ent2 with rat Ent1 allowed Ent1 to transport AZT and enhanced its uptake
of ddC and ddI, indicating that the N-terminal region of ENT proteins is
the major site of 3-prime-deoxy-nucleoside interaction.

GENE STRUCTURE

Williams et al. (1997) found that the HNP36 gene consists of 12 exons.

MAPPING

Williams et al. (1997) used fluorescence in situ hybridization to
localize the HNP36 gene to human chromosome 11q13, within 80 kb of the
D11S913 locus.

614787	TITLE *614787 POGO TRANSPOSABLE ELEMENT WITH ZNF DOMAIN; POGZ
;;KIAA0461
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated human brain cDNA
library, Seki et al. (1997) cloned POGZ, which they designated KIAA0461.
The deduced protein contains 1,355 amino acids.

Using the N-terminal activation domains of the transcription factor SP1
(189906) to screen a cDNA library originating from SW613-S human colon
carcinoma cells, Gunther et al. (2000) cloned a splice variant of
KIAA0461 that included an insertion of an additional 53 amino acids near
the N terminus. The deduced 1,411-amino acid full-length protein has 9
putative zinc fingers of the C2H2 type and 2 proline-rich regions in a
central domain, and small acidic stretches at both the N- and C-termini.

Nozawa et al. (2010) found that full-length 1,410-amino acid POGZ
contains an irregular zinc finger motif following the central cluster of
9 C2H2-type zinc fingers and that the C-terminal domain contains a
centromere protein B (CENPB; 117140)-like DNA-binding domain and a DDE
domain that originated from a transposase encoded by a pogo-like DNA
transposon.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Gunther et al. (2000) found that the
N-terminal half of KIAA0461 interacted with the N-terminal
transactivation domains of SP1.

HP1-alpha (CBX5; 604478) has an essential role in heterochromatin
formation and mitotic progression through interaction of its PxVxL motif
with several cell cycle proteins. Nozawa et al. (2010) found that POGZ
bound HP1-alpha, but via an atypical zinc finger, called the HP1-binding
zinc finger-like (HPZ) domain, rather than the canonical PxVxL motif.
POGZ bound HP1-alpha in a competitive manner with PxVxL motif-binding
proteins such as TIF1-beta (TRIM28; 601742) and INCENP (604411).
Knockdown of POGZ in human cell lines caused mitotic defects, with
accelerated mitosis, abnormal chromosome segregation, nuclear
fragmentation, and disrupted mitotic HP1-alpha localization and Aurora
kinase B (AURKB; 604970) activity. The defects were similar to those
caused by knockdown of Aurora kinase B. Expression of the HPZ domain
alone corrected the mitotic defects in POGZ knockdown cells. Nozawa et
al. (2010) concluded that the HP1-chromatin interaction is destabilized
by binding of POGZ, permitting Aurora kinase B activation and mitotic
progression.

MAPPING

Hartz (2012) mapped the POGZ gene to chromosome 1q21.3 based on an
alignment of the POGZ sequence (GenBank GENBANK AB007930) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

605590	TITLE *605590 SPLICING FACTOR 3B, SUBUNIT 1; SF3B1
;;SF3B, 155-KD SUBUNIT; SF3B155;;
SPLICEOSOME-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN, 155-KD; SAP155
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Introns are removed from nuclear pre-mRNA in 2 transesterification
reactions. Splicing takes place in a large ribonucleoprotein particle,
the spliceosome. Spliceosomal intermediate complexes form on pre-mRNA in
the order E, A, B, and C, with the catalytic reactions occurring in
complex C. U2 small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs; see 180690) are
among the proteins essential for spliceosome assembly and mRNA splicing.
Functional U2 snRNP is composed of a 12S unit and 2 splicing factors,
SF3A, which is composed of 3 proteins (see SF3A1; 605595), and SF3B,
which is composed of 4 proteins, including SF3B1 (summary by Kramer et
al. (1995), Wang et al. (1998), and Isono et al. (2001)).

CLONING

By SDS-PAGE fractionation of spliceosomal complex A, micropeptide
sequence analysis, database searching, and cDNA library screening, Wang
et al. (1998) isolated a cDNA encoding SF3B1, which they called SAP155.
Sequence analysis predicted that the 1,304-amino acid protein is 50%
identical to the yeast sequence. The C-terminal two-thirds of SF3B1 can
align into 22 PP2A (PPP2R1B; 603113)-like repeats, and the nonconserved
N terminus contains multiple TPGH and RWDETP motifs but lacks SR
domains. Western blot analysis detected the 155-kD protein in the
spliceosomal A/B complex and a larger phosphorylated protein in the C
complex. The authors showed that the phosphorylation occurs concomitant
with the catalytic steps of splicing.

Isono et al. (2001) isolated a cDNA encoding the 146-kD mouse homolog.
The amino acid sequence of Sf3b1 was very highly conserved among
homologs from Schizosaccharomyces pombe (52.4% identity) to human
(99.6%), and the C-terminal 825 residues of these homologs showed even
higher identities.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Golas et al. (2003) determined the 3-dimensional structure of the human
SF3B complex by single-particle electron cryomicroscopy at a resolution
of less than 10 angstroms, allowing identification of protein domains
with known structural folds. The best fit of a modeled RNA recognition
motif indicates that the protein p14 (607835) is located in the central
cavity of the complex. The 22 tandem helical repeats of the protein
SF3B155 are located in the outer shell of the complex enclosing p14.

GENE FUNCTION

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis and pull-down assays of mouse nuclear
extracts, Isono et al. (2005) found that Sf3b1 interacted directly with
the Polycomb group proteins Pcgf2 (600346) and Rnf2 (608985).
Furthermore, Sf3b1 colocalized with Polycomb proteins on the 5-prime
regions of individual Hox genes.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the SF3B1
gene to chromosome 2 (TMAP stSG34935).

Isono et al. (2001) mapped the mouse homolog of human SF3B1 to the
central part of chromosome 1 by interspecific backcross analysis. This
location was also consistent with the mapping data obtained by using a
radiation hybrid panel.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Somatic Mutations

Using whole-exome sequencing of bone marrow cells, Papaemmanuil et al.
(2011) found that 6 of 9 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS;
614286) carried 1 of 2 somatic heterozygous mutations in the SF3B1 gene:
a lys700-to-glu (K700E) substitution or a his662-to-gln (H662Q)
substitution, in addition to somatic mutations in several other genes.
Targeted resequencing of this gene found that 72 (20%) of 354 patients
with MDS had mutations in the SF3B1 gene. The majority of the patients
(68%) with mutations had refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts,
although 6% had refractory anemia with excess blasts. Mutations in the
SF3B1 gene were also found less frequently in bone marrow from patients
with other chronic myeloid disorders, such as primary myelofibrosis
(254450), essential thrombocythemia (187950), and chronic myelomonocytic
leukemia (CMML; see 607785), as well as in acute myeloid leukemia (AML;
601626). Somatic mutations were also found in about 1% of primary solid
tumors. The mutations occurred throughout the gene, but were clustered
in exons 12 to 15; K700E was the most common mutation, accounting for 59
(55%) of the 108 variants observed. Alignment and in silico studies
indicated that the mutations were not severely deleterious, suggesting
that the mutant proteins retain structural integrity and some function.
Gene expression profiling studies suggested a disturbance of
mitochondrial gene networks in stem cells from MDS patients with SF3B1
mutations. Clinically, MDS patients with SF3B1 mutations had higher
median white cell count, higher platelet count, higher erythroid
hyperplasia, lower proportion of bone marrow blasts, and overall longer
survival compared to those without SF3B1 mutations, suggesting a more
benign phenotype.

Using whole-exome sequencing of matched tumor and normal samples from
105 individuals with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL; 151400) followed
by expansion studies in an additional 174 CLL patients, Quesada et al.
(2012) found that 27 (9.7%) of the 279 patients had somatic mutations in
the SF3B1 gene. All SF3B1 mutations occurred in the nonidentical HEAT
domains, and SF3B1-mutant cases showed enhanced expression of truncated
mRNAs of various genes. Clinically, patients with SF3B1 mutations had
faster disease progression and poorer overall survival compared to those
with other mutations. No SF3B1 mutations were found in 156 cases of
non-Hodgkin lymphoma (605027).

Harbour et al. (2013) described mutations occurring exclusively at codon
625 of the SF3B1 gene in low-grade uveal melanoma (155720) with good
prognosis.

ANIMAL MODEL

Isono et al. (2005) found that homozygous Sf3b1-null mouse embryos died
during preimplantation development around the 16- to 32-cell stage.
Heterozygous animals appeared normal and healthy; however, they
exhibited various skeletal alterations along the anterior-posterior
axis. Consistent with the axial changes, expression of several Hox genes
was anteriorly extended in the paraxial mesoderm and second branchial
arch. Isono et al. (2005) concluded that Sf3b1 regulates Hox gene
expression in association with Polycomb group proteins.

602367	TITLE *602367 PENTRAXIN I, NEURONAL; NPTX1
;;NP1
DESCRIPTION For background information on pentraxins, see NPTX2 (600750).

CLONING

Neuronal pentraxin I (NP1) was identified in the rat as a binding
protein for the snake venom toxin taipoxin (Schlimgen et al., 1995).
Omeis et al. (1996) cloned the human NP1 homolog by screening a human
cerebellar cDNA library with the rat Np1 gene as a probe. The gene,
designated NPTX1, encodes a predicted 430-amino acid protein that is 95%
identical to rat Np1. Northern blot analysis showed that the
approximately 6-kb NPTX1 mRNA is expressed only in brain.

GENE FUNCTION

Xu et al. (2003) found that rat Np1 was part of a pentraxin complex that
included Narp (NPTX2). The proteins were covalently linked by disulfide
bonds, and their relative ratio in the complex was dynamically dependent
upon the activity history and developmental stage of the neuron. Narp
was more effective than Np1 in assays of cell surface cluster formation,
coclustering of AMPA-type glutamate receptors (see 138248), and
excitatory synaptogenesis, but combined expression of Narp and Np1
resulted in supraadditive effects.

MAPPING

Omeis et al. (1996) used fluorescence in situ hybridization to map the
NPTX1 gene to human chromosome 17q25.1-q25.2 and mouse chromosome
11e2-e1.3.

614585	TITLE *614585 FERREDOXIN 1-LIKE PROTEIN; FDX1L
;;FDX1-LIKE PROTEIN;;
FERREDOXIN 2; FDX2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

FDXL1 is a mitochondrial iron-sulfur (Fe/S) protein that transfers
electrons from NADPH via FDXR (103270) and functions in Fe/S protein
biosynthesis (Sheftel et al., 2010).

CLONING

Using Western blot analysis, Sheftel et al. (2010) found that FDX2 was
variably expressed in most human tissues examined, with highest
expression in testis, kidney, and brain. Epitope-tagged FDX2
cofractionated with a mitochondrial marker in HeLa cells. Sheftel et al.
(2010) noted that the predicted mature form of FDX1L shares 50% amino
acid identity with yeast adrenodoxin homolog-1 (Yah1).

GENE FUNCTION

Sheftel et al. (2010) found that recombinant human FDX2 exhibited
spectra characteristic of a 2Fe-2S protein. Depletion of FDX2 in HeLa
cells resulted in decreased activities of mitochondrial aconitase (ACO2;
100850), cytosolic aconitase (ACO1; 100880), mitochondrial complex I
(see 157655), COX (see 516030), and succinate dehydrogenase (see
600857). Knockdown of FDX2 also reduced cellular content of 2Fe-2S
proteins, iron incorporation into complexes I and II, mitochondrial iron
accumulation, and cell proliferation. FDX2, but not FDX1 (103260),
functionally complemented Yah1 deficiency in yeast. However, FDX2 could
not substitute for FDX1 in steroidogenesis. Sheftel et al. (2010)
concluded that FDX2 is critical for heme A and 2Fe-2S protein synthesis.

MAPPING

Sheftel et al. (2010) stated that the FDX1L gene maps to chromosome
19p13.2.
