DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Intronic regions of ribosomal protein genes can harbor noncoding small
nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), like SNORD83A, which are generated during
pre-mRNA processing. snoRNAs form part of the small nucleolar
ribonucleoprotein particles (snoRNPs) involved in pre-rRNA processing
and modification. snoRNAs of the box C/D class, like SNORD83A, function
in 2-prime-O-ribose methylation of rRNAs (Duga et al., 2000).

CLONING

Duga et al. (2000) identified several snoRNAs, including SNORD83A, which
they called U83A, within introns of the bovine and human RPL3 (604163)
genes. U83A originates from intron 5 of RPL3. The 95-nucleotide U83A has
a region complementary to 18S RNA and contains canonical motifs of box
C/D snoRNAs. Sequence analysis suggested that U83A forms a stem-loop
structure through basepairing of the 5-prime and 3-prime terminal
sequences. In this model, the loop contains boxes C and D on either side
of the stem, with the sequence complementary to 18S rRNA located
immediately upstream of box D. Northern blot analysis using a bovine
probe detected U83A expression in HeLa cells, mouse fibroblasts, and
bovine brain. RT-PCR detected U83A expression in a bovine kidney cell
line.

MAPPING

Duga et al. (2000) identified SNORD83A within intron 5 of the RPL3 gene
on chromosome 22q.
