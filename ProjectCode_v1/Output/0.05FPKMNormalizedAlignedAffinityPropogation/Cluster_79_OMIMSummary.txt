DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

To identify retinal homeobox-containing genes, Freund et al. (1997)
screened a human retina cDNA library at low stringency with a fragment
from the human CHX10 (142993) cDNA. One of the isolated cDNAs encoded a
novel gene, which the authors termed CRX for 'cone-rod
homeobox-containing gene.' CRX encodes a 299-amino acid protein with a
predicted mass of 32 kD that is most similar to the human OTX1 (600036)
and OTX2 (600037) homeodomain proteins. The CRX homeodomain is located
near the amino terminus at residues 39 to 99 and belongs to the prd
class. Additional domains of the CRX protein include the WSP motif and
the OTX tail. The CRX gene was expressed as an abundant 4.5-kb
transcript in retina but not in any other of 10 tissues or cells
examined.

Furukawa et al. (1997) isolated the mouse Crx gene from mouse retina.
The human CRX cDNA is 97% identical to the mouse gene. Crx expression
was restricted to developing and mature photoreceptor cells. Crx bound
and transactivated the sequence TAATCC/A, which is found upstream of
several photoreceptor-specific genes, including the opsin genes from
many species. Overexpression of Crx using a retroviral vector increased
the frequency of clones containing exclusively rod photoreceptors and
reduced the frequency of clones containing amacrine interneurons and
Muller glial cells. In addition, presumptive photoreceptor cells
expressing a dominant negative form of Crx failed to form proper
photoreceptor outer segments and terminals. The authors concluded that
Crx is a photoreceptor-specific transcription factor and plays a crucial
role in the differentiation of photoreceptor cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Akagi et al. (2004) reported that CRX and OTX2 effectively induced the
generation of photoreceptor-specific phenotypes from ciliary- and
iris-derived cells of adult rat. More than 90% of the CRX- and
OTX2-transfected ciliary- and iris-derived cells exhibited rod opsin
immunoreactivity, whereas few of the similarly transfected
mesencephalon-derived neural stem cells from embryonic rat expressed rod
opsin. At least 2 additional key components of the phototransduction
cascade, recoverin (179618) and G-delta-T1, were expressed by CRX- and
OTX2-transfected iris-derived cells. Akagi et al. (2004) concluded that
CRX and OTX2 induced phenotype generation in cells derived from iris or
ciliary tissue, which may suggest an approach to photoreceptor cell
preparation for retinal transplantation.

Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7; 164500) is an inherited
neurodegenerative disorder caused by expansion of a polyglutamine tract
in the ataxin-7 (ATXN7; 607640) protein. A unique feature of SCA7 is
degeneration of photoreceptor cells in the retina, resulting in cone-rod
dystrophy. In an SCA7 transgenic mouse model, La Spada et al. (2001)
found that the cone-rod dystrophy involved altered photoreceptor gene
expression due to interference with CRX. By coimmunoprecipitation
analysis of CRX and ATXN7 truncation and point mutants, Chen et al.
(2004) determined that the ATXN7-interacting domain of CRX localized to
its glutamine-rich region and that the CRX-interacting domain of ATXN7
localized to its glutamine tract. Nuclear localization of ataxin-7 was
required to repress Crx transactivation, and the likely nuclear
localization signals were mapped to the C-terminal region of ataxin-7.
Using chromatin immunoprecipitation, the authors showed that both Crx
and ataxin-7 occupied the promoter and enhancer regions of Crx-regulated
retinal genes in vivo. Chen et al. (2004) suggested that one mechanism
of SCA7 disease pathogenesis may be transcription dysregulation, and
that CRX transcription interference may be a predominant factor in SCA7
cone-rod dystrophy retinal degeneration.

MAPPING

Using a combination of in situ hybridization, somatic cell hybrid and
radiation hybrid mapping, and yeast artificial chromosome contig
analysis, Freund et al. (1997) mapped the CRX gene to 19q13.3 in the
interval between markers D19S219 and D19S246 in the critical region of
the cone-rod dystrophy-2 locus (CORD2; 120970).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Freund et al. (1997) found a missense and a frameshift mutation in the
CRX gene in 2 pedigrees with CORD2 (120970). The authors showed that the
missense (602225.0001) mutation was not a polymorphic variant and
concluded that mutation in the CRX gene is responsible for the CORD2
phenotype.

Swain et al. (1997) found an arg41-to-trp substitution in the third
residue of the CRX homeodomain in the proband from a family with
autosomal dominant CORD. The sequence change cosegregated with the
disease phenotype and was not detected in 247 normal controls. The data
suggested that mutations in the CRX gene are associated with
photoreceptor degeneration and that the Crx protein is necessary for the
maintenance of normal cone and rod function.

Because CRX is essential for photoreceptor maintenance and because
expression of a dominant-negative CRX allele in developing retina
prevented outer segment biogenesis (Furukawa et al., 1997), Freund et
al. (1998) tested the hypothesis that CRX mutations are responsible for
some cases of the Leber congenital amaurosis phenotype by examining the
CRX gene of 74 Leber congenital amaurosis patients. They identified 2
patients with a de novo deletion mutation (602225.0003-602225.0004,
respectively) as the cause of Leber congenital amaurosis-7 (LCA7;
613829). Their findings indicated that the product of the CRX gene is
essential not only for normal maintenance of the photoreceptor, as
demonstrated by mutations causing autosomal dominant cone-rod dystrophy
(120970), but also possibly essential for early photoreceptor
development.

CRX is a transcription factor for several retinal genes, including the
opsins and the gene for interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein.
Because loss of CRX function could alter the expression of a number of
other retinal proteins, Sohocki et al. (1998) screened for mutations in
the CRX gene in probands with a range of degenerative retinal diseases.
Of the 294 unrelated individuals screened, they identified 4 CRX
mutations in families with clinical diagnoses of autosomal dominant
cone-rod dystrophy, late-onset dominant retinitis pigmentosa, or
dominant Leber congenital amaurosis (early-onset retinitis pigmentosa),
and they identified 4 additional benign sequence variants.

Rivolta et al. (2001) summarized 18 mutations in the CRX gene associated
with retinal abnormalities. Except for 1 obviously null allele not
definitely associated with a phenotype (a frameshift in codon 9), all
CRX mutations appeared to be completely penetrant and caused disease in
heterozygotes. These dominant alleles fell into 2 categories. In one
group were missense mutations and short, in-frame deletions; in the
second group were frameshift mutations, all of which were in the last
exon. All of these dominant mutations were likely to produce stable mRNA
that is translated. Rivolta et al. (2001) did not detect a correlation
between type of disease and type of mutation. Four of the mutations were
de novo and these were found in isolated cases of Leber congenital
amaurosis. Rivolta et al. (2001) noted that dominant CRX mutations have
not been associated with mental retardation or developmental delay that
has sometimes been found in Leber congenital amaurosis caused by
mutation in other genes.

Chen et al. (2002) used transient transfection and mobility shift assays
to investigate the consequences of 11 known mutations in CRX in vitro.
They demonstrated that the C-terminal region, between amino acids 200
and 284, is essential for CRX-mediated transcriptional activation. Three
homeodomain missense mutations (R41W, 602225.0005; R41Q, 602225.0006;
and R90W, 602225.0007) displayed decreased transactivating activity, and
E80A (602225.0001) demonstrated markedly increased activity. In vitro
protein-DNA binding assays with mutant CRX homeodomain peptides
demonstrated that the alteration was due to reduced DNA binding to CRX
targets. The authors hypothesized that CRX mutations involved in human
photoreceptor degeneration act by impairing CRX-mediated transcriptional
regulation of the photoreceptor genes. However, since a clear
relationship between the magnitude of biochemical abnormality and degree
of disease severity was not observed, the authors suggested that other
genetic and environmental modifiers may also contribute to the disease
phenotype.

ANIMAL MODEL

CRX is expressed not only in the photoreceptors of the retina, but also
in the pinealocytes of the pineal gland. Furukawa et al. (1999)
generated mice carrying a targeted disruption of Crx. Homozygous
deficient mice did not elaborate photoreceptor outer segments and lacked
rod and cone activity as assayed by electroretinogram. Expression of
several photoreceptor- and pineal-specific genes was reduced in Crx
mutants. Circadian entrainment was also affected in Crx -/- mice. To
examine photoentrainment activity in homozygous deficient mice, Furukawa
et al. (1999) recorded the activity of wildtype and Crx -/- mice running
on an exercise wheel. All mice showed robust 24-hour rhythms in activity
during entrainment and in constant darkness. All mice showed the most
activity during the dark interval of a 24-hour period. The percentage of
total activity that occurred at night, however, was significantly less
in homozygous deficient mice than in wildtype mice. All mice
re-entrained to the light-dark cycle following an advance of 4 hours in
the cycle; however, the number of days required to complete the shift
was greater in Crx -/- mice.

Zebrafish proved a useful model for studying circadian gene regulation
and pineal organ function. The Crx gene was thought to regulate pineal
circadian activity. In the mouse, targeted inactivation of Crx caused a
reduction in pineal gene expression and attenuated entrainment to
light/dark cycles (Furukawa et al., 1999). Gamse et al. (2002) showed
that Crx and Otx5 (orthodenticle homeobox-5) orthologs are expressed in
both the pineal organ and the asymmetrically positioned parapineal of
larval zebrafish. Circadian gene expression was unaffected by a
reduction in Crx expression but was inhibited specifically by depletion
of Otx5. These results indicate that Otx5 rather than Crx regulates
genes that show circadian expression in the zebrafish pineal complex.

Using expression studies in transgenic mice under conditional Otx2
(600037) gene ablation, Nishida et al. (2003) presented evidence that
Otx2 is a direct upstream regulator of Crx and acts via binding to
specific consensus sequences in the Crx promoter.

Menotti-Raymond et al. (2010) identified a putative mutation in the CRX
gene (546delC) as the cause of autosomal dominant rod-cone dysplasia
(Rdy) in a pedigree of cats segregating for the disorder. Disease
expression in Rdy cats is comparable to that in young patients with
Leber congenital amaurosis or retinitis pigmentosa.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CONE-ROD DYSTROPHY 2
CRX, GLU80ALA

In a Greek family with autosomal dominant CORD2 (120970), Freund et al.
(1997) identified a GAG-to-GCG mutation at codon 80 of one allele of the
CRX gene. The mutation was not a common polymorphism in the Greek
population since it was not found in more than 100 normal Greek alleles
or in more than 600 other Caucasian control alleles examined. The
glu80-to-ala mutation is located within the CRX homeodomain.

.0002
CONE-ROD DYSTROPHY 2
CRX, 1-BP DEL, 502G

In a northern European family with autosomal dominant CORD2 (120970),
Freund et al. (1997) identified a deletion of G at nucleotide 502 of one
allele of the CRX cDNA (codon 168). This deletion results in a
frameshift and premature termination of the CRX protein.

.0003
LEBER CONGENITAL AMAUROSIS 7
CRX, 2-BP DEL, GLU168

Using SSCP analysis and direct sequencing of PCR-amplified exons of the
CRX gene, Freund et al. (1998) identified putative disease-causing de
novo deletion mutations in CRX in 2 patients with Leber congenital
amaurosis-7 (613829): a 2-bp deletion at the glu168 codon (E168del2bp)
and a 1-bp deletion at the gly217 codon (G217del1bp; 602225.0004). Both
deletions caused frameshifts, and the predicted proteins lacked the
conserved carboxy-terminal tail. The E168del2bp allele had lost an AG
dinucleotide from the GAG codon for the eleventh residue within the
conserved 13-amino acid WSP motif. If the mRNA containing this premature
stop codon were stable, 45% of the protein would be lost and replaced
with a new C terminus of 4 amino acids (VPFA). The G217del1bp allele was
due to deletion of a G nucleotide, also within a short conserved
sequence, and the predicted protein would lack 25% of the C terminus,
with 1 new amino acid (alanine) encoded after the frameshift. Curiously,
the E168del2bp mutation occurred within the same codon as a mutation
found in an autosomal dominant cone-rod dystrophy family (602225.0003).
Both E168 and G217 are followed by polypyrimidine runs, a feature
commonly associated with deletions. Neither mutation was present in any
of the parents or in 360 control CRX alleles. Freund et al. (1998)
stated that although they were unable to identify a mutation in the
other CRX allele of either patient, both might nevertheless carry a
second CRX mutation (such as a promoter or mid-intron mutation) that
remains to be discovered. If that is the case, the inheritance would be
recessive.

.0005
CONE-ROD DYSTROPHY 2
CRX, ARG41TRP

In the proband from a family with autosomal dominant CORD2 (120970),
Swain et al. (1997) found an arg41-to-trp substitution in the third
residue of the CRX homeodomain. The substitution caused a decrease in
DNA binding activity. The sequence change cosegregated with the disease
phenotype and was not detected in 247 normal controls.

.0006
CONE-ROD DYSTROPHY 2
CRX, ARG41GLN

In the proband from a family segregating autosomal dominant cone-rod
dystrophy-2 (120970), Swain et al. (1997) identified a G-to-A transition
in the CRX gene, resulting in an arg41-to-gln (R41Q) substitution. This
mutation involves the same codon as the arg41-to-trp mutation
(602225.0005) found by Swain et al. (1997) in a patient with autosomal
dominant CORD2.

Sohocki et al. (1998) identified the R41Q mutation in a proband
originally diagnosed with late-onset dominant retinitis pigmentosa. The
authors stated that later analysis of additional members of this family
suggested an alternative diagnosis of late-onset, atypical, cone-rod
dystrophy. None of the other 163 probands with a diagnosis of autosomal
dominant RP studied by Sohocki et al. (1998) were found to have a
mutation in the CRX gene.

.0007
LEBER CONGENITAL AMAUROSIS 7
CRX, ARG90TRP

In a patient with Leber congenital amaurosis-7 (613829), Swaroop et al.
(1999) identified a homozygous substitution of arginine (arg) at codon
90 by tryptophan (trp) in the CRX homeodomain due to a C-to-T transition
in exon 3 of the CRX gene. Swaroop et al. (1999) found that the mutant
CRX (R90W) homeodomain demonstrated decreased binding to the previously
identified cis sequence elements in the rhodopsin promoter. In transient
transfection experiments, the mutant protein showed significantly
reduced ability to transactivate the rhodopsin promoter, as well as
lower synergistic activation with the transcription factor NRL (162080).

.0008
LEBER CONGENITAL AMAUROSIS 7
CRX, 1-BP DEL, 520G

Nakamura et al. (2002) reported a novel de novo mutation in the CRX gene
in a Japanese patient with Leber congenital amaurosis-7 (613829). The
CRX gene was analyzed by direct genomic sequencing in the patient with
LCA and in his healthy parents. They identified a heterozygous deletion
of G at nucleotide 520 in CRX, predicting a frameshift in codon 174 and
a premature termination of translation. The mutation was not present in
the proband's unaffected parents. Except for CRX, all known genes that
cause LCA cause the disorder in an autosomal recessive fashion. This
mutation was similar to the other 5 known de novo mutations in CRX
because it was a heterozygous deletion of 1 or 2 base pairs in exon 3
causing a frameshift, producing a protein lacking the conserved OTX tail
motif near the C terminus.

.0009
CONE-ROD DYSTROPHY 2
CRX, 1-BP DEL, 615C

In a 3-generation Japanese family with cone-rod dystrophy (CORD;
120970), Itabashi et al. (2004) identified a heterozygous deletion of a
cytidine at nucleotide 615 in exon 1 of the CRX gene (605delC).
Ophthalmic findings included negative-type electroretinogram and rapid
progression after age 40 years.

CONE-ROD DYSTROPHY 2
CRX, 3-BP DEL/2-BP INS, NT816

In a 2-generation German family with cone-rod dystrophy (CORD2; 120970),
Paunescu et al. (2007) identified a novel heterozygous complex mutation
(816delCACinsAA) in the CRX gene, predicting the substitution of 27
C-terminal amino acids by 44 novel amino acids.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

One of the major mediators of the inborn or 'natural' immune system is
the natural killer (NK) cell. Dixon et al. (1993) prepared a subtractive
cDNA library from human NK cells and characterized 13 unique clones. A
clone named B2-1 was highly expressed in both NK and T cells, but was
very weakly expressed or absent in several other cell lines. The deduced
protein was highly homologous to the yeast protein SEC7, which is
located in the Golgi apparatus and is thought to be involved in
transporting proteins through the Golgi complex. B2-1 was the only known
human protein with significant homology to SEC7 and may be one of the
human equivalents of the yeast secretory proteins.

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a T-cell leukemia cell line with the
intracellular portion of CD18 (ITGB2; 600065) as bait, Kolanus et al.
(1996) isolated a cDNA encoding cytohesin-1 (PSCD1) and a partial cDNA
encoding PSCD2L (602488), which they designated cts18.1. PSCD1 is 88%
identical to the PSCD2L fragment. The predicted 398-amino acid PSCD1
protein contains a central 200-residue SEC7 domain and a C-terminal
pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. Western blot analysis showed expression
of a 47-kD protein, particularly, but not exclusively, in lymphoid
cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Kolanus et al. (1996) found that overexpression of a full-length PSCD1
protein or of the SEC7 domain only induced CD18-dependent binding to
ICAM1 (147840), whereas the PSCD1 PH domain specifically inhibited
adhesion. Binding analysis indicated that the SEC7 domain, but not the
PH domain, interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of CD18 but not with
other cell surface receptors or protein-tyrosine kinases tested. Kolanus
et al. (1996) concluded that PSCD1 specifically regulates the adhesive
function of beta-2 integrins in lymphocytes.

The induction of a transformed cellular phenotype by viruses requires
the modulation of signaling pathways through viral proteins. Kliche et
al. (2001) showed that the phenotypic changes induced by the kaposin A
protein of human herpesvirus-8 are mediated through its direct
interaction with cytohesin-1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF)
for ARF GTPases (e.g., ARF1; 103180) and regulator of integrin-mediated
cell adhesion. Focus formation, stress fiber dissolution, and activation
of the ERK1 (601795)/ERK2 (176948) mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK) signal cascade were reverted by a cytohesin-1 glu157-to-lys
mutant, which is deficient in catalyzing guanine nucleotide exchange.
Furthermore, liposome-embedded kaposin A was found to specifically
stimulate cytohesin-1-dependent GTP binding of myristoylated ARF1 in
vitro.

Hafner et al. (2006) used an aptamer displacement screen to identify
SecinH3, a small Sec7 domain-specific molecular antagonist of
cytohesins. The cytohesins are a class of BFA-resistant small GEFs for
ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs), which regulate cytoskeletal
organization, integrin activation, or integrin signaling. The
application of SecinH3 in human liver cells showed that insulin receptor
complex-associated cytohesins are required for insulin signaling.
SecinH3-treated mice showed increased expression of gluconeogenic genes,
reduced expression of glycolytic, fatty acid, and ketone body metabolism
genes in the liver, reduced liver glycogen stores, and a compensatory
increase in plasma insulin. Thus, Hafner et al. (2006) concluded that
cytohesin inhibition results in hepatic insulin resistance.

Vitale et al. (2000) found that cytohesin-1 interacted with ARF domain
protein-1 (ARD1, or TRIM23; 601747) in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a
human liver cDNA library. ARD1-GDP interacted well with cytohesin-1 but
poorly with cytohesin-2 (PSCD2; 602488), and cytohesin-1 accelerated
binding of a nonhydrolyzable GTP analog to ARD1. Mutation analysis
showed that the effector region of the ARF domain of ARD1 interacted
with the Sec7 domain of cytohesin-1. Physical association between these
domains was highly dependent on experimental conditions, and a free
Mg(2+) concentration that favored nucleotide release from ARD1 and
accumulation of the nucleotide-free ARD1 form also favored interaction
between ARD1 and cytohesin-1. In transfected COS-7 cells, cytohesin-1
was distributed throughout the cell and was also present in the nucleus.
ARD1 associated with vesicular structures concentrated around the
nucleus and scattered throughout the cytoplasm, corresponding to Golgi
and lysosomes, respectively. A constitutively GDP-bound form of ARD1
showed a similar distribution, whereas a constitutively GTP-bound form
of ARD1 was concentrated close to the nucleus in a Golgi-like
distribution only. When ARD1 or its GDP- and GTP-bound forms were
coexpressed with cytohesin-1, only the GDP-bound form showed any change
in distribution or colocalization with cytohesin-1. In 90% of cells
coexpressing the proteins, the GDP-bound form of ARD1 was distributed
throughout the cell, except for the nucleus, and largely colocalized
with cytohesin-1. In less than 10% of cells coexpressing the proteins,
the GDP-bound form of ARD1 and cytohesin-1 colocalized in lysosomes.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Ogasawara et al. (2000) determined that
the PSCD1 gene contains at least 14 exons, including a 3-bp exon 10 also
present in PSCD2 and PSCD3 (605081) but not in PSCD4 (606514) that
results in the insertion of a single glycine into the variable loop
between the first and second beta sheets in the pleckstrin homology
domain.

MAPPING

Dixon et al. (1993) showed by PCR analysis of a human/rodent hybrid
panel that the B2-1 gene is located on chromosome 17. Fluorescence in
situ hybridization localized the gene to 17q25.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Kikuchi et al. (1988) isolated a gene from a yeast genomic library that
could complement a temperature-sensitive mutant of Saccharomyces
cerevisiae. The gene, termed GST1, seemed to be essential for the G1- to
S-phase transition in the yeast cell cycle. The gene product appeared to
be a GTP-binding protein of molecular mass 76,565 Da with 38% identity
in amino acid sequence with the alpha subunit of elongation factor-1
(130590). Hoshino et al. (1989) cloned the human equivalent from a cDNA
library.

Hoshino et al. (1998) cloned mouse Gspt1. The deduced 635-amino acid
protein has a unique N terminus and a conserved C-terminal eukaryotic
elongation factor-1-alpha-like domain. The mouse and human Gspt1
proteins share 94% sequence identity. RT-PCR analysis indicated
expression of Gspt1 in all mouse tissues examined.

GENE FUNCTION

Eukaryotic RF1 (ETF1; 600285) and RF3 are involved in translation
termination. In vitro, RF1 catalyzes the release of the polypeptide
chain without any stop codon specificity; the GTP-binding protein RF3
confers GTP dependence to the termination process and stimulates RF1
activity. Le Goff et al. (1997) used tRNA-mediated nonsense suppression
of different stop codons in a CAT reporter gene to analyze the
polypeptide chain release factor activities of recombinant human RF1 and
RF3 proteins overexpressed in human cells. Using a CAT assay, they
measured the competition between the suppressor tRNA and the release
factors when a stop codon was present in the ribosomal A site.
Regardless of which of the 3 stop codons was present in the CAT open
reading frame, the overexpression of RF1 alone markedly decreased
translational read-through by suppressor tRNA. Thus, Le Goff et al.
(1997) concluded that RF1 has intrinsic antisuppressor activity. The
levels of antisuppression when both RF1 and RF3 were overexpressed were
almost the same as those when RF1 was overexpressed alone, suggesting
that RF1-RF3 complex-mediated termination may be controlled by the
expression level of RF1. Overexpression of RF3 alone had an inhibitory
effect on CAT gene expression. CAT mRNA stability studies suggested that
RF3 inhibits gene expression at the transcriptional level. Le Goff et
al. (1997) suggested that RF3 may perform other functions, including the
stimulation of RF1 activity, in vivo.

Hoshino et al. (1998) found that expression of Gspt1 by Swiss 3T3 cells
increased with serum or phorbol ester stimulation. By
coimmunoprecipitation and yeast 2-hybrid analyses, they found
interaction between mouse Gspt1 and human eRF1. Hoshino et al. (1998)
hypothesized that Gspt1, in a binary complex with eRF1, functions as a
polypeptide chain release factor.

Alkalaeva et al. (2006) reconstituted eukaryotic translation initiation,
elongation, and termination processes in vitro on a model mRNA encoding
a tetrapeptide followed by a UAA stop codon using individual 40S and 60S
ribosomal subunits and the complete set of individual initiation,
elongation, and release factors. They found that binding of human ERF1
and ERF3A and GTP to the ribosomal pretermination complex induced a
structural rearrangement characterized by a 2-nucleotide forward shift
of the toeprint attributed to the pretermination complex. Subsequent GTP
hydrolysis was required for rapid hydrolysis of peptidyl tRNA in the
pretermination complex. Cooperativity between ERF1 and ERF3A in ensuring
fast peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis required the ERF3A-binding C-terminal
domain of ERF1.

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen and in vitro and in vivo binding assays,
including reciprocal immunoprecipitation assays, Tompkins et al. (2006)
showed that GSPT1 bound the p19(ARF) isoform of CDKN2A (600160), but not
the p16(INK4A) isoform.

MAPPING

By nonradioactive in situ hybridization, Ozawa et al. (1992) mapped the
GSPT1 gene, the human homolog of the yeast gene GST1, to human
chromosome 16p13.1. Southern blot hybridization with a panel of
human-rodent somatic cells confirmed the localization of the GSPT1 gene
on chromosome 16 and also showed the existence of a homologous gene on
the X chromosome (GSPT2; 300418). They pointed out that a breakpoint for
nonrandom chromosome rearrangements has been found in the region of
GSPT1 in patients with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia.
