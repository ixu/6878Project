607419	TITLE *607419 GEM-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 7; GEMIN7
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

GEMIN7 is part of the large macromolecular SMN complex (see 600354),
which is localized to both the cytoplasm and the nucleus and plays a
role in the cytoplasmic assembly of small nuclear ribonuculeoproteins
(snRNPs).

CLONING

Pellizzoni et al. (2002) identified a number of proteins that
coimmunoprecipitate with SMN or with GEMIN2 (602595) from lysates of
human kidney cells, including GEMIN6 (607006) and a 15-kD protein.
Baccon et al. (2002) sequenced the 15-kD protein, which they called
GEMIN7, identified corresponding ESTs, and cloned GEMIN7 by PCR
amplification of a cDNA library. The deduced 131-amino acid GEMIN7
protein contains several RG repeats. By EST database searching, Baccon
et al. (2002) also identified the putative mouse ortholog, which shares
82% amino acid sequence identity with the human protein.

GENE FUNCTION

Using coimmunoprecipitation and immunolocalization experiments, Baccon
et al. (2002) demonstrated that GEMIN7 is a component of the SMN complex
and colocalizes with SMN in the cytoplasm and in gems. Binding
experiments showed that GEMIN7 interacts directly with SMN and GEMIN6
and mediates the association of GEMIN6 with the SMN complex. The RG
repeats were necessary for its interaction with SMN. GEMIN7 also
interacted with several Sm proteins of snRNPs, particularly with SmE
(SNRPE; 128260).

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the GEMIN7
gene to chromosome 19 (TMAP SHGC-112).

601874	TITLE *601874 ELONGATION FACTOR, RNA POLYMERASE II, 2; ELL2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The elongation stage of eukaryotic mRNA synthesis is a major site for
the regulation of gene expression. Moreover, there is evidence that
misregulation of transcription elongation may be a key element in a
variety of human diseases. For example, elongin, also known as SIII or
transcription elongation factor B (600786, 600787, 600788), is a
potential target for regulation by the product of the von Hippel-Lindau
tumor suppressor gene (608537), which is mutated in a majority of
clear-cell renal carcinomas and in families with von Hippel-Lindau
disease. The ELL gene (600284) on 19p13.1 was originally isolated as a
gene that undergoes frequent translocations with the MLL gene (159555)
on 11q23 in acute myeloid leukemia. ELL encodes an elongation factor
that can increase the catalytic rate of RNA polymerase II transcription
by suppressing transient pausing by the polymerase at multiple sites
along the DNA. As part of an effort to understand how elongation by RNA
polymerase II is controlled under normal cell conditions and in disease,
Shilatifard et al. (1997) initiated a search for ELL-related proteins.
They described the identification and characterization of ELL2, a novel
ELL-related RNA polymerase II elongation factor. They showed that it is
49% identical and 66% similar to ELL. Mechanistic studies indicated that
ELL2 and ELL possess similar transcriptional activities.
Structure-function studies localized the ELL2 elongation activation
domain to an ELL2 N-terminal region that is highly homologous to ELL.
Northern blot analysis revealed that ELL2 and ELL are transcribed in
many of the same tissues, but that the ratio of their transcripts
exhibits tissue-to-tissue variation, raising the possibility that ELL2
and ELL may not perform completely general functions, but instead, may
perform gene- or tissue-specific functions.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the ELL2
gene to chromosome 5 (TMAP RH47475).

606699	TITLE *606699 HELICASE WITH ZINC FINGER DOMAIN; HELZ
;;KIAA0054;;
HUMORF5
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

HELZ is a member of the superfamily I class of RNA helicases. RNA
helicases alter the conformation of RNA by unwinding double-stranded
regions, thereby altering the biologic activity of the RNA molecule and
regulating access to other proteins (Wagner et al., 1999).

CLONING

Nomura et al. (1994) isolated a full-length HELZ cDNA, which they termed
KIAA0054, from a human immature myeloid cell line cDNA library. The
deduced 1,942-amino acid protein contains an ATP/GTP-binding site motif
A (P-loop). Wagner et al. (1999) found that the protein contains several
motifs characteristic of members of the RNA helicase superfamily I,
including a putative purine nucleotide-binding site. By Northern blot
analysis, Nomura et al. (1994) demonstrated ubiquitous expression of
HELZ. Using the gene trapping method, Wagner et al. (1999) identified
the mouse homolog of HELZ and found widespread spatial and temporal
expression throughout murine embryonic development.

GENE FUNCTION

Based on the complex transcription pattern and widespread
spatial-temporal distribution of the mouse HELZ homolog, Wagner et al.
(1999) suggested that HELZ may play a role in RNA metabolism in multiple
tissues and organs within the developing embryo.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the HELZ
gene to chromosome 17 (TMAP SHGC-10970).

ENX
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

On the basis of the mouse Tlx2 (Hox11l1) sequence, Puliti et al. (1999)
designed primers to amplify human genomic DNA. Based on the sequence of
the PCR product, 2 human specific primers were synthesized to screen the
CEPH YAC library. Two human YAC clones were identified that contain the
human homolog of the mouse Tlx2 gene.

GENE FUNCTION

The mouse Hox11l1 gene is expressed from embryonic day 9.5 through day
13.5 and is specifically detectable in the dorsal root ganglia, cranial
and enteric nerve ganglia, and adrenal glands, while in adult animals
its expression is limited to the adrenal gland and the intestine. Since
the expression of Hox11l1 is restricted to tissues derived from neural
crest cells, Hatano et al. (1997) hypothesized a role for this gene in
the proliferation and/or differentiation of enteric peripheral nervous
system.

GENE STRUCTURE

Iitsuka et al. (1999) identified a retinoic acid response element in the
human and mouse HOX11L1 promoters. They also identified an enhancer
element in the mouse promoter that was crucial for tissue-specific
expression, and this element was conserved in the human promoter. The
enhancer element bound nuclear proteins from both human and mouse
neuroblastoma cells.

MAPPING

HOX11 (186770)-related genes are scattered on different chromosomes
(Dear et al., 1993). Using a mouse EST cDNA clone showing sequence
homology with Hox11l1 cDNA to perform FISH, Puliti et al. (1999) mapped
the mouse Hox11l1 gene to chromosome 6, band C3-D1. This region of mouse
chromosome 6 shows homology of synteny with human 2p14-p13. Using FISH,
Puliti et al. (1999) localized the HOX11L1 gene to chromosome
2p13.1-p12.

ANIMAL MODEL

Hatano et al. (1997) and Shirasawa et al. (1997) generated transgenic
mice carrying Tlx2 null mutations. Homozygous mice were viable but
developed megacolon with hyperinnervated enteric neurons, similar to
human neuronal intestinal dysplasia (601223, 243180).

603368	TITLE *603368 CYCLIN-DEPENDENT KINASE 6; CDK6
;;PLSTIRE
CDK6/MLL FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The cyclin-dependent protein kinases (CDKs) regulate major cell cycle
transitions in eukaryotic cells. By RT-PCR of HeLa cell mRNA with
degenerate primers corresponding to conserved regions of CDC2 (116940),
Meyerson et al. (1992) identified cDNAs encoding 7 novel human protein
kinases. They designated 1 of these proteins PLSTIRE, following the
accepted practice of naming cdc2-related kinases based on the amino acid
sequence of the region corresponding to the conserved PSTAIRE motif of
CDC2. The predicted 326-amino acid PLSTIRE protein shares 47% and 71%
identity with CDC2 and PSK-J3 (CDK4; 123829). The in vitro
transcription/translation product has an apparent molecular weight of 40
kD by SDS-PAGE. Northern blot analysis revealed that the PLSTIRE gene
was expressed as 13-, 8.5-, and 6-kb mRNAs in several human tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

Meyerson and Harlow (1994) demonstrated that PLSTIRE is associated with
cyclins D1 (168461), D2 (123833), and D3 (123834) in lysates of human
cells and is activated by coexpression with D-type cyclins in Sf9 insect
cells. PLSTIRE immunoprecipitated from human cells exhibited significant
kinase activity, and was able to phosphorylate RB1 (614041). Based on
these findings, they renamed the protein CDK6 (cyclin-dependent kinase
6). In primary T cells that were stimulated to enter the cell cycle,
cellular CDK6 kinase activity first appeared in mid-G1, prior to the
activation of any previously characterized CDK. Meyerson and Harlow
(1994) suggested that CDK6, and the homologous CDK4, link growth factor
stimulation with the onset of cell cycle progression.

Guan et al. (1994) proposed that CDK4 and CDK6 are physiologic RB1
kinases that are inhibited by the p14 (600431), p16 (600160), and p18
(603369) CDK inhibitors. This inhibition prevents the phosphorylation of
RB1 and keeps RB1 in its active growth-suppressing state. See CDKN2D
(600927).

Harbour et al. (1999) presented evidence that phosphorylation of the
C-terminal region of RB by CDK4/CDK6 initiates successive intramolecular
interactions between the C-terminal region and the central pocket. The
initial interaction displaces histone deacetylase from the pocket,
blocking active transcriptional repression by RB. This facilitates a
second interaction that leads to phosphorylation of the pocket by CDK2
and disruption of pocket structure. These intramolecular interactions
provide a molecular basis for sequential phosphorylation of RB by
CDK4/CDK6 and CDK2. CDK4/CDK6 is activated early in G1, blocking active
repression by RB. However, it is not until near the end of G1, when
cyclin E (see 123837) is expressed and CDK2 is activated, that RB is
prevented from binding and inactivating E2F (189971).

Veiga-Fernandes and Rocha (2003) showed that, in contrast to naive CD8
(see 186910) T cells in G0/G1 arrest, memory CD8 T cells in G0/G1 arrest
have low expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27(Kip1)
(CDKN1B; 600778) and high CDK6 activity. They found that preactivated
CDK6 is associated with cyclin D3 (CCND3) in the cytoplasm, facilitating
the switch to S phase and the rapid division of memory cells.
Veiga-Fernandes and Rocha (2003) concluded that naive T cells are in the
classic state of G0/G1 arrest with low amounts of D cyclins and CDK6 and
CDK2 (116953) activity but high levels of CDKN1B, whereas memory cells
have high levels of CCND3 and CDK6 activity in a distinct G0/G1 state.

Using microarray analysis, Lena et al. (2012) found that microRNA-191
(MIR191; 615150) was significantly upregulated in normal human neonatal
epidermal keratinocytes (HEKn) following development of senescence in
culture. Bioinformatic analysis and reporter gene assays revealed
functional MIR191 target sequences in the 3-prime UTRs of transcripts
for CDK6 and the AT-rich binding protein SATB1 (602075). Western blot
analysis confirmed that ectopic expression of MIR191 in HEKn cells
caused downregulation of SATB1 and CDK6, concomitant with decreased cell
proliferation and expression of senescence markers.

MAPPING

By analysis of a somatic cell hybrid panel, Bullrich et al. (1995)
mapped the CDK6 gene to 7p13-cen. However, radiation hybrid analysis and
inclusion within a mapped clone place the CDK6 gene at 7q21-q22 (TMAP
SGC34899).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Because of sequence and functional similarities between CDK4 (123829),
mutations in which cause familial melanoma (609048), and CDK6, Shennan
et al. (2000) hypothesized that germline mutations in CDK6 might
predispose to melanoma. They detected no CDK6 mutations, however, within
the p16-binding domain in index cases from 60 melanoma-prone kindreds
lacking germline mutations in the coding regions of either CDKN2A or
within the entire CDK4 coding region. They concluded that germline
mutations in CDK6 do not make a significant contribution to melanoma
predisposition.

For a discussion of an association between variation in the CDK6 gene
and stature, see STQTL11 (612223).

CYTOGENETICS

In an infant diagnosed at the age of 3 weeks with acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (ALL; 613065) after presenting with hepatosplenomegaly and
marked leukocytosis, Raffini et al. (2002) found a 3-way rearrangement
of the MLL (159555), AF4 (159557), and CDK6 genes. By reverse-panhandle
PCR, they identified a breakpoint junction of CDK6 from band 7q21-q22
and MLL intron 9. CDK6 is overexpressed or disrupted by translocation in
many cancers, e.g., T cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (Chilosi et al.,
1998), T cell ALL, natural killer/T cell nasal lymphoma (Lien et al.,
2000), and glioblastoma multiforme (Costello et al., 1997). B cell
splenic lymphomas with villous lymphocytes are characterized by
t(2;7)(p12;q21) translocation juxtaposing CDK6 to the IGKC gene
(147200). The patient of Raffini et al. (2002) had an in-frame CDK6-MLL
transcript along with an in-frame MLL-AF4 transcript.

ANIMAL MODEL

Malumbres et al. (2004) found that Cdk6-null mice were viable and
developed normally, although hematopoiesis was slightly impaired.
Embryos defective for Cdk4 and Cdk6 died during the late stages of
embryonic development due to severe anemia. However, these embryos
displayed normal organogenesis, and most cell types proliferated
normally. In vitro, embryonic fibroblasts lacking Cdk4 and Cdk6
proliferated and became immortal upon serial passage. Quiescent
Cdk4/Cdk6-null cells responded to serum stimulation and entered S phase
with normal kinetics, although with lower efficiency. These results
indicated that D-type cyclin-dependent kinases are not essential for
cell cycle entry and suggested the existence of alternative mechanisms
to initiate cell proliferation upon mitogenic stimulation.

;;WOLF-HIRSCHHORN SYNDROME CANDIDATE 1;;
NUCLEAR SET DOMAIN-CONTAINING 2; NSD2;;
MULTIPLE MYELOMA SET DOMAIN; MMSET
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome (WHS; 194190) is a malformation syndrome
associated with a hemizygous deletion of the distal short arm of
chromosome 4 (4p16.3). The shortest region of overlap of the deletions
observed in WHS patients, the WHS critical region, has been confined to
a region of 165 kb (Wright et al., 1997). This region was sequenced
completely during the search for the Huntington disease gene (Baxendale
et al., 1993). Stec et al. (1998) described a novel developmental gene,
two-thirds of which maps in the distal part of the WHS critical region.
They designated the gene WHSC1 (Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome candidate-1).
The WHSC1 gene was identified initially through its high similarity to
the translation product of an expressed sequence tag, located in the
165-kb WHCR, with the SET domain (see 600960) of the Drosophila protein
ASH1 (607999). The SET domain is found in proteins that are involved in
embryonic development. The WHSC1 gene was found to be expressed
ubiquitously in early development and to undergo complex alternative
splicing and differential polyadenylation. It encodes a 136-kD protein
containing 4 domains present in other developmental proteins: a PWWP
domain, an HMG box, a SET domain also found in the Drosophila dysmorphy
gene ash-encoded protein, and a PHD-type zinc finger. It is expressed
preferentially in rapidly growing embryonic tissues, in a pattern
corresponding to affected organs in WHS patients. The nature of the
protein motifs, the expression pattern, and its mapping to the critical
region led Stec et al. (1998) to propose WHSC1 as a good candidate gene
to be responsible for many of the phenotypic features of WHS.

GENE FUNCTION

Nimura et al. (2009) showed that the H3K36me3-specific histone
methyltransferase Whsc1 functions in transcriptional regulation together
with developmental transcription factors whose defects overlap with the
human disease Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome (WHS). Nimura et al. (2009) found
that mouse Whsc1, 1 of 5 putative Set2 homologs, governed H3K36me3 along
euchromatin by associating with the cell type-specific transcription
factors Sall1 (602218), Sall4 (607343), and Nanog (607937) in embryonic
stem cells, and Nkx2-5 (600584) in embryonic hearts, regulating the
expression of their target genes. Whsc1-deficient mice showed growth
retardation and various WHS-like midline defects, including congenital
cardiovascular anomalies. The effects of Whsc1 haploinsufficiency were
increased in Nkx2-5 heterozygous mutant hearts, indicating their
functional link. Nimura et al. (2009) proposed that WHSC1 functions
together with developmental transcription factors to prevent the
inappropriate transcription that can lead to various pathophysiologies.

Pei et al. (2011) found that H4K20 methylation actually increases
locally upon the induction of double-strand breaks and that methylation
of H4K20 at double-strand breaks is mediated by the histone
methyltransferase MMSET in mammals. Downregulation of MMSET
significantly decreases H4K20 methylation at double-strand breaks and
the subsequent accumulation of 53BP1 (605230). Furthermore, Pei et al.
(2011) found that the recruitment of MMSET to double-strand breaks
requires the gamma-H2AX (601772)-MDC1 (607593) pathway; specifically,
the interaction between the MDC1 BRCT domain and phosphorylated ser102
of MMSET. Thus, Pei et al. (2011) proposed that a pathway involving
gamma-H2AX-MDC1-MMSET regulates the induction of H4K20 methylation on
histones around double-strand breaks, which, in turn, facilitates 53BP1
recruitment.

GENE STRUCTURE

The WHSC1 gene contains 25 exons (Stec et al., 1998).

MAPPING

Stec et al. (1998) mapped the WHSC1 gene to chromosome 4p16.3 based on
genomic sequence analysis.

CYTOGENETICS

Stec et al. (1998) noted that the t(4;14)(p16.3;q32.3) translocations
described in a significant fraction of multiple myelomas (Richelda et
al., 1997; Chesi et al., 1997) have breakpoints located less than 100 kb
centromeric of the FGFR3 gene (134934) on 4p16.3. They found that at
least 3 of the breakpoints merged the immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene
(IGHG1; 147100) on chromosome 14 with the WHSC1 gene. This fusion of
genes and their untimely expression in the myeloid lineage driven from
the 5-prime IgH enhancer may indicate that WHSC1-encoded proteins are
involved in the clinical heterogeneity of multiple myeloma.

615263	TITLE *615263 FAMILY WITH SEQUENCE SIMILARITY 86, MEMBER A; FAM86A
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Methyltransferases catalyze the transfer of a methyl group from a donor,
generally S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet), to acceptor molecules,
including proteins, DNA, RNA, lipids, and small metabolites. FAM86A
belongs to a family of protein lysine methyltransferases that methylate
nonhistone proteins (Cloutier et al., 2013).

CLONING

By searching databases for sequences similar to METTL22 (615261),
Cloutier et al. (2013) identified FAM86A. The deduced protein is made up
predominantly of a Rossmann fold of alternating beta strands and alpha
helices, with a conserved AdoMet-binding site near the N terminus.
Epitope-tagged FAM86A was predominantly expressed in a diffuse
cytoplasmic distribution in transfected HeLa cells.

GENE FUNCTION

By affinity purification, SDS-PAGE, and mass spectrometry, Cloutier et
al. (2013) found that FAM86A expressed in HEK293 cells interacted with
FAM86B and FAM86C.

MAPPING

Hartz (2013) mapped the FAM86A gene to chromosome 16p13.3 based on an
alignment of the FAM86A sequence (GenBank GENBANK AY037162) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

614443	TITLE *614443 EBNA1-BINDING PROTEIN 2; EBNA1BP2
;;EBP2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

EBNA1BP2 binds to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) nuclear antigen-1 (EBNA1),
the viral protein required for replication and stable maintenance of EBV
(Shire et al., 1999). EBNA1BP2 also functions in a dynamic scaffold for
ribosome biogenesis (Hirano et al., 2009).

CLONING

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a lymphocyte cDNA library to detect
EBNA1-interacting proteins, Shire et al. (1999) identified EBNA1BP2,
which they termed EBP2. The 306-amino acid protein has a calculated
molecular mass of 35 kD. It contains coiled-coil and helix-loop-helix
domains.

By separating proteins in the ribonucleoprotein-containing nuclear
matrix fraction of HeLa cells, followed by peptide mass fingerprint
analysis, Hirano et al. (2009) identified EBNA1BP2. Fluorescence
microscopy localized EBNA1BP2 to nucleolus.

GENE FUNCTION

Using coimmunoprecipitation analysis, Shire et al. (1999) confirmed that
EBP2 interacted with full-length EBNA1 containing a gly-ala repeat. EBP2
also bound DNA-bound EBNA1 in a 1-hybrid system. Shire et al. (1999)
concluded that the EBNA1-EBP2 interaction is important for stable
integration of EBV episomes during cell division, but not for
replication of the episomes.

Using RNA interference knockdown analysis in HeLa cells, Hirano et al.
(2009) found evidence suggesting that EBNA1BP2 and BXDC1 (RPF2) function
in a dynamic scaffold for ribosome biogenesis.

Huber et al. (2000) found that the N-terminal region of the yeast
homolog of EBP2 contains nucleolar-associated KKE motifs. Fluorescence
microscopy demonstrated nucleolar localization. Deletion analysis
revealed that the evolutionarily conserved C-terminal region of yeast
Ebp2 was required for protein activity. Mutants in Ebp2 were defective
in processing the 27 SA into the 27 SB precursor rRNA.

MAPPING

Gross (2012) mapped the EBNA1BP2 gene to chromosome 1p35-p33 based on an
alignment of the EBNA1BP2 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC009175) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

612314	TITLE *612314 GLUTATHIONE S-TRANSFERASE, OMEGA-2; GSTO2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The omega class glutathione transferases (GST; EC 2.5.1.18) have poor
activity with common GST substrates, but exhibit novel
glutathione-dependent thioltransferase, dehydroascorbate reductase, and
monomethylarsonate reductase activities, and they modulate Ca(2+)
release by ryanodine receptors (e.g., RYR1, 180901) (Whitbread et al.,
2003).

For background information on GSTs, see 605482.

CLONING

By sequencing a chromosome 10 BAC contig containing the GSTO1 gene
(605482), Whitbread et al. (2003) identified GSTO2. The deduced
243-amino acid protein shares 64% identity with GSTO1. Northern blot
analysis detected a 2-kb GSTO2 transcript highly expressed in testis,
and a 1.26-kb GSTO2 transcript highly expressed in liver, kidney, and
skeletal muscle, with lower expression in heart and reproductive
tissues, predominantly testis, cervix, ovary, and prostate.

GENE STRUCTURE

Whitbread et al. (2003) determined that the GSTO2 gene contains 6 exons
and spans 24.5 kb.

MAPPING

By sequencing an unordered chromosome 10 contig containing GSTO1,
Whitbread et al. (2003) mapped the GSTO2 gene to chromosome 10q24-q25,
about 7.5-kb downstream of the GSTO1 gene.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

By PCR of an existing cDNA clone and by PCR of a testis cDNA library,
Whitbread et al. (2003) identified a GSTO2 polymorphism: a 424A-C
transition resulting in an asn142-to-asp (N142D) substitution.

;;FRIZZLED 5
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Wang et al. (1996) cloned and sequenced a large family of mammalian
homologs of the Drosophila polarity gene 'frizzled' (see 600667). One of
these was a human gene, termed 'frizzled 5,' isolated from a retina cDNA
library. Wang et al. (1996) determined that this gene encodes a
polypeptide of 585 amino acids.

GENE FUNCTION

He et al. (1997) showed that human frizzled 5 is the receptor for the
Wnt5A (164975) ligand.

MAPPING

Wang et al. (1996) used interspecific backcross analysis to map the gene
to mouse chromosome 1 between the markers Ctla4 (123890) and Fn1
(135600), which is syntenic to human chromosome 2q33-q34.

606432	TITLE *606432 UDP-GLYCOSYLTRANSFERASE 1 FAMILY, POLYPEPTIDE A7; UGT1A7
;;UGT1G
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Enzymes of the UDP glycosyltransferase (UGT; EC 2.4.1.17) superfamily
covalently link glycosyl groups to lipophilic substrates. UGT1A enzymes,
such as UGT1A7, efficiently use UDP-glucuronic acid as the glycosyl
donor and are invaluable in detoxifying both endogenous and foreign
chemicals, because the glycosylated chemical is more water soluble and
therefore more readily excreted. Several UGT1A enzymes, including
UGT1A7, are encoded by the UGT1A gene complex on chromosome 2q37. Within
this complex, 9 viable first exons are independently spliced to 4 common
exons to generate 9 UGT1A transcripts with unique 5-prime ends and
identical 3-prime ends. UGT1A7, like each first exon within the UGT1A
gene complex, is considered a unique gene linked to the 4 common exons
(Gong et al., 2001; Mackenzie et al., 2005). See 191740 for further
information on the UGT1A gene complex.

CLONING

Using quantitative duplex RT-PCR, Strassburg et al. (1997) analyzed
UGT1A expression in hepatic, biliary, and gastric tissues. UGT1A3
(606428) and UGT1A6 (606431) are expressed in all 3 tissues, whereas
UGT1A5 (606430) and UGT1A8 (606433) are expressed in none. UGT1A9
(606434) is expressed only in hepatic tissue, but UGT1A1 (191740) and
UGT1A4 (606429) are also expressed in biliary tissue. Strassburg et al.
(1997) detected expression of UGT1A10 (606435) in both biliary and
gastric tissue, but expression of UGT1A7 in only gastric tissue. The
530-amino acid UGT1A7 protein shares 90% identity with UGT1A10, with all
differences in the N-terminal portion, and contains a 24-residue leader
sequence not present in UGT1A10. Strassburg et al. (1997) concluded that
the UGT1A locus is under complex and tissue-specific regulation.

Using Northern blot analysis, Basu et al. (2004) detected
tissue-specific expression of UGT1A1, UGT1A7, UGT1A8, UGT1A9, and
UGT1A10. UGT1A7 showed the broadest distribution, with high expression
in stomach, thyroid, and adrenal gland and lower expression in most
other tissues examined. In situ hybridization showed highest expression
of UGT1A7 in mucous-secreting squamous esophageal cells.

GENE FUNCTION

In a review of the UGTs, Tukey and Strassburg (2000) indicated that
UGT1A7 has moderate activity on phenols and less on other substrates.

Basu et al. (2004) showed that UGT1A1, UGT1A7, UGT1A8, UGT1A9, and
UGT1A10 metabolized a broad range of chemicals, predominantly
flavonoids, anthraquinones, hydrocarbons, and simple phenols. They also
exhibited different pH optima according to the particular substrate and
differed in their responses to high substrate concentrations. UGT1A7 was
the most versatile enzyme examined and exhibited the most rapid
kinetics. Its pH optima ranged from 6.0 to 8.5.

MAPPING

By Southern blot analysis, Ritter et al. (1992) determined that all of
the UGT1A genes map to the same locus on chromosome 2.

600355	TITLE *600355 NEURONAL APOPTOSIS INHIBITORY PROTEIN; NAIP
;;BACULOVIRAL IAP REPEAT-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1; BIRC1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

In a search for the gene causing spinal muscular atrophy (SMA; 253300),
Roy et al. (1995) isolated a gene on chromosome 5q13.1, of which the
first 2 coding exons were deleted in approximately 67% of type I SMA
chromosomes compared with 2% of non-SMA chromosomes. One model of SMA
pathogenesis invokes an inappropriate persistence of motor neuron
apoptosis, which is a normally occurring phenomenon in development.
Consistent with this hypothesis, the novel gene was labeled 'neuronal
apoptosis inhibitory protein' (NAIP) and its function was supported by
the finding that it contains domains with sequence similarity to IAPs,
baculovirus proteins that inhibit virally induced insect cell apoptosis.
The presence of a variable number of copies of truncated and internally
deleted versions of the NAIP gene (pseudogenes) was thought to be a
possible factor in the genesis of SMA. This situation was compared to
that of the genes on 6p that code for steroid 21-hydroxylase (CYP21)
deficiency (201910); through the processes of unequal crossing-over or
gene conversion, mutations in the functional CYP21 gene (613815) can
result. Roy et al. (1995) raised the possibility that NAIP functions in
concert with SMN (600354) mutations in causing spinal muscular atrophy.

GENE FUNCTION

Liston et al. (1996) demonstrated that expression of NAIP in mammalian
cells inhibits apoptosis induced by a variety of signals.

NAIP, HIAP1 (601721), HIAP2 (601712), XIAP (300079), BIRC5 (603352), and
BIRC6 (605638) are members of the mammalian inhibitors of apoptosis
family and contain an N-terminal domain with 1 to 3 imperfect repeats of
an approximately 65-amino acid domain named the baculovirus IAP repeat
(BIR) motif. Gotz et al. (2000) identified 6 mouse Naip genes which were
expressed in a broad range of tissues. Using a neurite outgrowth assay
in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells, they observed that Naip
overexpression impaired nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced neurite
outgrowth. The BIR motifs of Naip (residues 1-345) were not required for
this effect. However, the BIR domains of Naip were essential to prevent
apoptosis in PC12 cells after NGF deprivation or tumor necrosis
factor-alpha receptor (TNFAR; 191190) stimulation. Expression of
full-length but not BIR-deleted Naip protected against cell death. This
correlated with reduced activity of the cell death effector protease,
caspase-3 (600636), in lysates of Naip-PC12 cells. The authors
hypothesized that dysregulation of cellular differentiation and/or
caspase suppression may contribute to motoneuron dysfunction and cell
death in spinal muscular atrophy where NAIP is mutated.

Kofoed and Vance (2011) showed in mice that different NAIP paralogs
determine the specificity of the NLRC4 (606831) inflammasome for
distinct bacterial ligands. In particular, they found that activation of
endogenous NLRC4 by bacterial PrgJ requires NAIP2, a previously
uncharacterized member of the NAIP gene family, whereas NAIP5 and NAIP6
activate NLRC4 specifically in response to bacterial flagellin. Kofoed
and Vance (2011) dissected the biochemical mechanism underlying the
requirement for NAIP proteins by use of a reconstituted NLRC4
inflammasome system. They found that NAIP proteins control
ligand-dependent oligomerization of NLRC4 and that the NAIP2-NLRC4
complex physically associates with PrgJ but not flagellin, whereas
NAIP5-NLRC4 associates with flagellin but not PrgJ. Kofoed and Vance
(2011) concluded that their results identified NAIPs as immune sensor
proteins in the mouse and provided biochemical evidence for a simple
receptor-ligand model for activation of the NAIP-NLRC4 inflammasomes.

Zhao et al. (2011) showed that NAIP5, required for Legionella
pneumophila replication in mouse macrophages, is a universal component
of the flagellin-NLCR4 pathway. NAIP5 directly and specifically
interacted with flagellin, which determined the inflammasome stimulation
activities of different bacterial flagellins. NAIP5 engagement by
flagellin promoted a physical NAIP5-NLRC4 association, rendering full
reconstitution of a flagellin-responsive NLRC4 inflammasome in
nonmacrophage cells. The related NAIP2 functioned analogously to NAIP5,
serving as a specific inflammasome receptor for type III secretion
system (TTSS) rod proteins such as Salmonella PrgJ and Burkholderia
BsaK. Genetic analysis of Chromobacterium violaceum infection revealed
that the TTSS needle protein Cpr1 can stimulate NLRC4 inflammasome
activation in human macrophages. Similarly, Cpr1 is specifically
recognized by human NAIP, the sole NAIP family member in human. The
finding that NAIP proteins are inflammasome receptors for bacterial
flagellin and TTSS apparatus components further predicted that the
remaining NAIP family members may recognize other microbial products to
activate NLRC4 inflammasome-mediated innate immunity.

To identify CASP1 (147678) functions in vivo, von Moltke et al. (2012)
devised a strategy for cytosolic delivery of bacterial flagellin, a
specific ligand for the NAIP5/NLRC4 inflammasome. Von Moltke et al.
(2012) showed that systemic inflammasome activation by flagellin leads
to a loss of vascular fluid into the intestine and peritoneal cavity,
resulting in rapid (less than 30 minutes) death in mice. This unexpected
response depends on the inflammasome components NAIP5, NLRC4, and CASP1,
but is independent of the production of IL1-beta (147720) or IL18
(600953). Instead, inflammasome activation results, within minutes, in
an 'eicosanoid storm'--a pathologic release of signaling lipids,
including prostaglandins and leukotrienes, that rapidly initiate
inflammation and vascular fluid loss. Mice deficient in cyclooxygenase-1
(COX1, PTGS1; 176805), a critical enzyme in prostaglandin biosynthesis,
are resistant to these rapid pathologic effects of systemic inflammasome
activation by either flagellin or anthrax lethal toxin.
Inflammasome-dependent biosynthesis of eicosanoids is mediated by the
activation of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (see 172410) in resident
peritoneal macrophages, which are specifically primed for the production
of eicosanoids by high expression of eicosanoid biosynthetic enzymes.
Von Moltke et al. (2012) concluded that their results identified
eicosanoids as a previously unrecognized cell type-specific signaling
output of the inflammasome with marked physiologic consequences in vivo.

MAPPING

Roy et al. (1995) mapped the NAIP gene to chromosome 5q13.1. DiDonato et
al. (1997) mapped the mouse homolog of NAIP to chromosome 13 in a region
showing conserved synteny with human 5q13.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Although NAIP deletions are more frequently observed in patients
affected by the acute form of SMA, it is not possible to establish an
unambiguous correlation between deletion size and clinical severity.
Novelli et al. (1997) investigated the effects of gender on the
association between NAIP gene deletion and disease severity. No
significant relationship between deletion size and clinical phenotype
was observed among male patients, whereas in females the absence of NAIP
was strongly associated with a severe phenotype (p less than 0.0001).
SMA I was found in 75.6% of females and only 52.5% of males lacking
NAIP. These results provided a possible molecular explanation for the
sex-dependent phenotypic variation observed in SMA patients.

ANIMAL MODEL

In inbred mouse strains, permissiveness to intracellular replication of
Legionella pneumophila is controlled by a single locus (Lgn1), which
maps to a region within distal chromosome 13 that contains multiple
copies of the Birc1 gene. Genomic BAC clones from the critical interval
were transferred into transgenic mice to complement functionally the
Lgn1-associated susceptibility of A/J mice to L. pneumophila. Diez et
al. (2003) found that 2 independent BAC clones that rescued
susceptibility had an overlapping region of 56 kb in which the entire
Lgn1 transcript must lie. The full-length transcript of Birc1e (also
called Naip5) is coded in this region. The results indicated a role for
Birc1e in macrophage resistance to L. pneumophila infection. BIRC1
proteins are members of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) family,
structurally defined by baculovirus inhibitor of apoptosis repeat (BIR)
domains implicated in protein-protein interactions. An antiapoptotic
effect of BIRC1 has been described. Induction of apoptosis seems to be
important for pathogenesis of L. pneumophila in human macrophages in
vitro.

Zamboni et al. (2006) noted that there are 14 amino acid differences in
Birc1e between A/J and C57Bl/6 mice. A/J macrophages permit more L.
pneumophila replication than C57Bl/6 macrophages. Zamboni et al. (2006)
found that Birc1e-expressing cells from C57Bl/6 mice, but not those from
A/J mice, responded to L. pneumophila infection and delivery of
bacterial molecules to the cytosol with Casp1 (147678)-dependent cell
death. Mutation analysis showed that the leucine-rich region of Birc1e
regulated Birc1e activation, Casp1 activation, and Il1b (147720)
secretion and required Ipaf (CARD12; 606831). Zamboni et al. (2006)
concluded that Birc1e is a nucleotide-binding
oligomerization-leucine-rich repeat protein involved in detection and
control of intracellular L. pneumophila.

604939	TITLE *604939 PHOSPHOLIPASE A2 RECEPTOR 1; PLA2R1
;;PHOSPHOLIPASE A2 RECEPTOR, 180-KD;;
PLA2R
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Secretory phospholipases A2 (PLA2s) have been purified from a variety of
mammalian tissues as well as from insect and snake venoms. The prototype
group I PLA2, the pancreatic PLA2 (PLA2G1B; 172410), is involved in
digestion, smooth muscle contraction, and cell proliferation. The
prototype group II PLA2, the inflammatory-type PLA2 (PLA2G2A; 172411),
is involved in inflammatory conditions and is upregulated by
proinflammatory cytokines like tumor necrosis factor (TNF; 191160) and
interleukin-1 (e.g., IL1B; 147720). Differential toxicity of snake venom
Pla2 appears to be linked to a variety of high-affinity receptors in
different organs (Ancian et al., 1995).

CLONING

By screening lung and kidney cDNA libraries with a rabbit Pla2 probe,
Ancian et al. (1995) isolated a cDNA encoding PLA2R1. Sequence analysis
revealed that the deduced 1,465-amino acid PLA2R1 transmembrane protein
contains a 25-amino acid signal sequence, 15 potential N-glycosylation
sites, an N-terminal cysteine-rich domain, a fibronectin-like type II
domain, 8 carbohydrate recognition domains, and a short C-terminal
cytoplasmic tail containing a consensus sequence (asn-pro-X-tyr) also
found in bovine Pla2r1. A casein-kinase II phosphorylation site is also
located in this C-terminal region. Ancian et al. (1995) identified a
splice variant encoding a soluble form of PLA2R1. Quantitative PCR
analysis suggested that the ratio for the transcription of membrane to
soluble PLA2R1 is 1.6. Northern blot analysis detected strong expression
of 6.5- and 5.4-kb PLA2R1 transcripts in kidney, with moderate
expression in placenta, lung, and skeletal muscle. Binding analysis
showed that snake venom Pla2 binds to both forms of PLA2R1, and binding
could be blocked by pancreatic PLA2 but not by bee venom or inflammatory
PLA2. Using a radioactive probe and kinetic analyses, Ancian et al.
(1995) observed that membrane PLA2R1 is internalized and that its ligand
is degraded, suggesting a role for the receptor in clearing and possibly
inhibiting PLA2 action.

MAPPING

By radioactive in situ hybridization, Ancian et al. (1995) mapped the
PLA2R1 gene to 2q23-q24.

GENE FUNCTION

Beck et al. (2009) identified PLA2R as a target antigen in idiopathic
membranous nephropathy, an organ-specific autoimmune disease. Serum
samples from 26 (70%) of 37 patients with idiopathic, but not secondary,
membranous nephropathy specifically identified a 185-kD glycoprotein
that was present in nonreduced glomerular extract. Mass spectrometry of
the reactive protein band identified the M-type phospholipase A2
receptor. Reactive serum specimens recognized recombinant PLA2R and
bound the same 185-kD glomerular protein as did the monospecific
antibody. Anti-PLA2R autoantibodies in serum samples from patients with
membranous nephropathy were mainly IgG4, the predominant immunoglobulin
subclass in glomerular deposits. PLA2R was found to be normally
expressed in podocytes of human glomeruli and colocalized with IgG4 in
immune deposits in glomeruli of patients with membranous nephropathy.
IgG eluted from such deposits in patients with idiopathic membranous
nephropathy, but not in those with lupus membranous (SLE; 152700) or IgA
nephropathy (IGAN1; 161950). The findings demonstrated that a majority
of patients with idiopathic membranous nephropathy have antibodies
against a conformation-dependent epitope in PLA2R.

Stahl et al. (2010) reported a 56-year-old woman with biopsy-proven
membranous nephropathy that progressed to end-stage renal failure
necessitating renal transplantation. The nephropathy recurred within 3
days after transplantation. Anti-PLA2R antibodies were detected in serum
both before and after transplantation. After rituximab therapy, the
antibody titer fell from 1:100 to 1:20 and was associated with clinical
improvement. Stahl et al. (2010) suggested that the presence of
anti-PLA2R antibodies may identify potential risk of recurrence of
membranous nephropathy in patients undergoing renal transplant.

Debiec and Ronco (2011) assessed the presence of PLA2R autoantibody in
the serum and PLA2R in glomerular deposits in 42 consecutive patients
with biopsy-proven membranous nephropathy (614692) without features of
secondary disease. Serum samples were collected before treatment at the
time of biopsy. The sensitivities of the serum and biopsy tests were 57%
and 74%, respectively. Of the 42 patients, 21 with circulating PLA2R
autoantibodies had PLA2R in glomerular deposits. However, Debiec and
Ronco (2011) also found 3 patients who had a high circulating level of
PLA2R autoantibodies at a serum dilution of 1:3000 and who did not have
detectable PLA2R in glomerular deposits. The authors noted that these
cases might suggest that antibodies were not nephritogenic or that
epitopes were poorly accessible at the time of kidney biopsy. Eighteen
patients had no detectable PLA2R autoantibodies even at a serum dilution
of 1:10, although 10 of them had PLA2R in glomerular deposits. These
discordant findings might be due to rapid clearance of antibodies from
the blood and deposition in glomeruli or to the late referral of
patients when proteinuria persisted because of irreversible
ultrastructural changes. The authors concluded that the absence of
circulating PLA2R autoantibody at the time of kidney biopsy does not
rule out a diagnosis of PLA2R-related membranous nephropathy.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Stanescu et al. (2011) identified significant association between a SNP
in PLA2R1 (dbSNP rs4664308, with a p value of 8.6 x 10(-29)) and
idiopathic membranous nephropathy in 3 independent populations of
European descent: French, Dutch, and British.

609024	TITLE *609024 KDEL ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM PROTEIN RETENTION RECEPTOR 2; KDELR2
;;ERD2-LIKE PROTEIN 1; ELP1;;
ERD2.2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Resident soluble proteins within the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum
(ER) are retained there by virtue of a C-terminal tetrapeptide ER
retention signal, commonly lys-asp-glu-leu (KDEL) in mammals. KDELR2 is
one of the receptors that cycle between the Golgi apparatus and the ER,
returning proteins containing the KDEL signal to the ER (Lewis and
Pelham, 1992).

CLONING

By screening cDNA libraries with a KDELR1 (131235) sequence, followed by
5-prime RACE of a Burkitt lymphoma cell line cDNA library, Lewis and
Pelham (1992) cloned KDELR2, which they designated ERD2.2. The deduced
212-amino acid protein contains 7 transmembrane domains and shares 83.5%
identity with KDELR1, with most differences between the 2 receptors in
the transmembrane spans.

Using degenerate PCR primers designed from a conserved region of KDELR1
to amplify related cDNAs from an erythroleukemia cell line cDNA library,
followed by screening a T-cell cDNA library, Hsu et al. (1992) cloned
KDELR2, which they called ELP1. The deduced 214-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 24.6 kD. Northern blot analysis detected a
KDELR2 transcript of about 1.2 kb.

GENE FUNCTION

Lewis and Pelham (1992) observed that KDELR2 transfected into COS-7
cells accumulated predominantly in the Golgi complex, but when the
receptor was coexpressed with a target protein containing the KDEL ER
retention signal, it redistributed to the ER, mirroring the behavior of
KDELR1 under the same conditions.

Hsu et al. (1992) found that about half of KDELR1- or KDELR2-transfected
COS cells expressed the receptors in a juxtanuclear, Golgi-like pattern,
while the remainder showed a reticular, ER-like pattern with nuclear
envelope staining. Overexpression of the KDEL receptors led to the
ER-like pattern and was associated with the collapse of the Golgi
apparatus into the ER, as seen in cells treated with brefeldin A. In
addition to the loss of the Golgi apparatus as a distinct organelle,
overexpression resulted in redistribution of the Golgi coat protein,
beta-COP (COPB; 600959), to the cytosol, addition of complex
oligosaccharides to resident ER glycoproteins, and blockage of
anterograde traffic. Hsu et al. (1992) concluded that the KDEL receptors
provide signals that regulate retrograde traffic between the Golgi and
the ER.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the KDELR2
gene to chromosome 7 (TMAP SHGC-55953).

607003	TITLE *607003 THYMIC STROMAL LYMPHOPOIETIN; TSLP
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Several cytokines, including interleukin-7 (IL7; 146660), play a key
role in the development of B lymphocytes. TSLP is a member of this
family of B cell-stimulating factors.

CLONING

By EST and genomic database screening for sequences similar to IL7,
followed by screening a lung fibroblast sarcoma cDNA library, Reche et
al. (2001) obtained a cDNA encoding TSLP. The deduced 159-amino acid
protein, which is only 43% identical to mouse Tslp, contains a
28-residue signal sequence, 6 cysteines, and 2 N-glycosylation sites.
SDS-PAGE analysis showed expression of a 23-kD protein, larger than the
predicted 15 kD, suggesting that TSLP is glycosylated. PCR analysis of a
panel of cDNA libraries and cultured cell lines indicated that
expression of a 1.3-kb TSLP transcript may be restricted to a few lung
libraries. Reche et al. (2001) also identified TSLP receptor, which is
composed of TSLPR (CRLF2; 300357) and IL7R (146661) subunits. Dendritic
cells (DCs) and monocytes coexpress IL7R and TSLPR.

Quentmeier et al. (2001) also cloned and characterized TSLP. They noted
the presence of 7 basic C-terminal amino acids (KKRRKRK) in the protein
and that 6 of the 7 cysteines in the mouse protein (those involved in
disulfide bond formation) are conserved in human, whereas the sites for
N-glycosylation are distinct. Northern blot analysis revealed wide
expression of an approximately 1.1-kb transcript, with highest levels in
heart, liver, testis, and prostate.

MAPPING

Using radiation hybrid analysis, Quentmeier et al. (2001) mapped the
TSLP gene to chromosome 5 in a region showing homology of synteny to
mouse chromosome 18, where the mouse Tslp gene is localized.

GENE FUNCTION

Reche et al. (2001) showed that incubation of DCs or monocytes with TSLP
enhanced the expression of CCL17 (601520), CCL18 (603757), CCL22
(602957), and CCL19 (602227). IL7, on the other hand, induced expression
of CCL17, CCL22, and CCL19, but also CXCL8 (146930), CXCL7 (121010),
CXCL5 (600324), CXCL1 (155730), CXCL2 (139110), and CXCL3 (139111).
Functional analysis indicated that TSLP enhances the DC maturation
process, as evidenced by upregulation of DC markers and costimulatory
molecules and stronger T-cell proliferation.

By screening myeloid cell lines, Quentmeier et al. (2001) established
that an acute myeloid leukemia line, MUTZ-3, responds by proliferating
in response to TSLP. TSLP also inhibited apoptosis in these cells.
Proliferation in response to TSLP could not be attributed to the
production of other growth factors tested and could be inhibited by
relatively high concentrations of anti-IL7R. TSLP, like IL7, stimulated
phosphorylation of STAT5 (601511), but unlike IL7, it did not activate
JAK3 (600173). TSLP did not phosphorylate mitogen-activated protein
kinases (e.g., ERK1; 601795).

By flow cytometric analysis, Soumelis et al. (2002) showed that
TSLP-activated DCs (TSLP-DCs) express higher levels of HLA-DR and DCLAMP
(605883) than do nonactivated or IL7-activated DCs, and that TSLP-DCs
induce marked proliferation and expansion of allogeneic naive CD4
(186940)-positive T cells. Quantitative mRNA screening and ELISA
analysis showed that TSLP-DCs do not produce detectable proinflammatory
cytokines, but do produce high levels of TARC (CCL17) and MDC (CCL22)
chemokines, which preferentially attract CCR4 (604836)-expressing Th2
lymphocytes. TSLP-DCs induced CD4 cells to produce high amounts of IL13
(147683), IL5 (147850), and the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis
factor (TNF; 191160), but only low amounts of IL10 (124092) and
gamma-interferon (IFNG; 147570). RT-PCR analysis did not detect TSLP in
most hemopoietic cells, the exception being mast cells. Keratinocytes,
epithelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and lung fibroblasts also
expressed high levels of TSLP. Within tonsils, highest levels were in
crypt epithelial cells. Soumelis et al. (2002) suggested that TSLP may
contribute to constitutive inflammation in this tissue and sporadic
inflammation in squamous epithelium. Immunohistochemical analysis of
allergic inflammatory tissue showed high expression of TSLP in
keratinocytes of acute and chronic atopic dermatitis lesions, but no
expression in normal skin. Strong TSLP expression in atopic dermatitis
was associated with the disappearance of langerin (604862)-positive
Langerhans cells within the epidermis and the concurrent appearance of
many DCLAMP-activated DCs within the dermis, many of which expressed
langerin. Soumelis et al. (2002) proposed that TSLP expression by
keratinocytes in atopic dermatitis lesions may contribute directly to
the activation of Langerhans cells, which may migrate into the dermis
and then the draining lymph nodes where they can prime allergen-specific
Th2 responses.

Watanabe et al. (2005) reported that human Hassall corpuscles express
TSLP. Human TSLP activates thymic CD11c+ (151510) dendritic cells to
express high levels of CD80 (112203) and CD86 (601020). These
TSLP-conditioned cells are then able to induce the proliferation and
differentiation of CD4+/CD8-(186910)/CD25-(147730) thymic T cells into
CD4+/CD25+/FOXP3+ (300292) regulatory T cells. This induction depends on
peptide-MHC class II interactions and the presence of CD80 and CD86 as
well as IL2 (147680). Immunohistochemistry studies revealed that
CD25+/CTLA4+(123890) regulatory T cells associate in the thymic medulla
with activated or mature dendritic cells and TSLP-expressing Hassall
corpuscles. Watanabe et al. (2005) concluded that Hassall corpuscles
have a critical role in dendritic cell-mediated secondary positive
selection of medium to high affinity self-reactive T cells, leading to
the generation of CD4+/CD25+ regulatory T cells within the thymus.

Siracusa et al. (2011) demonstrated that TSLP promotes systemic
basophilia, that disruption of TSLP-TSLPR interactions results in
defective basophil responses, and that TSLPR-sufficient basophils can
restore TH2-cell-dependent immunity in vivo. TSLP acted directly on bone
marrow-resident progenitors to promote basophil responses selectively.
Critically, TSLP could elicit basophil responses in both IL3
(147740)-IL3R (see 308385)-sufficient and -deficient environments, and
genomewide transcriptional profiling and functional analyses identified
heterogeneity between TSLP-elicited versus IL3-elicited basophils.
Furthermore, activated human basophils expressed TSLPR, and basophils
isolated from eosinophilic esophagitis (see 610247) patients were
distinct from classical basophils. Siracusa et al. (2011) concluded that
collectively, their studies identified previously unrecognized
heterogeneity within the basophil cell lineage and indicated that
expression of TSLP may influence susceptibility to multiple allergic
diseases by regulating basophil hematopoiesis and eliciting a population
of functionally distinct basophils that promote TH2 cytokine-mediated
inflammation.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

For discussion of a possible association between variation in the TSLP
gene and eosinophilic esophagitis, see EOE2 (613412).

ANIMAL MODEL

Using mice deficient in Il7r and/or the common cytokine receptor gamma
chain, Il2rg (308380), Vobhenrich et al. (2003) determined the cytokines
responsible for fetal and perinatal lymphopoiesis in the absence of Il7.
Fetal and perinatal B-cell lymphopoiesis occurred in the bone marrow of
Il2rg -/- mice until 12 weeks of age, but it was absent in Il7r -/- mice
by 4 weeks of age. Lymphopoiesis in Il7r -/- mice was restricted to
fetal liver and was dependent on the presence of Tslp. The residual
lymphopoiesis that occurred in Il7r -/- mice was dependent on Flk2
(136351). Vobhenrich et al. (2003) concluded that TSLP is the main
factor driving IL7-independent fetal and perinatal lymphopoiesis,
although FLK2 is involved.

Using a mouse model of allergic skin inflammation elicited by repeated
epicutaneous (EC) sensitization with ovalbumin (OVA) to tape-stripped
skin, which mimics the scratching-inflicted injury associated with
atopic dermatitis (see 603165), He et al. (2008) found that Tslpr -/-
mice had reduced inflammation, with fewer eosinophils and local Th2
cytokine expression, but unchanged splenocyte secretion of these
cytokines. Addition of Tslp significantly enhanced Th2 cytokine
secretion in vitro by targeting Tlspr on antigen-specific T cells.
Intradermal injection of anti-Tlsp blocked the development of allergic
skin inflammation after EC antigen challenge of OVA-immunized wildtype
mice. He et al. (2008) proposed that TLSP is essential for
antigen-driven Th2 cytokine secretion by skin-infiltrating effector T
cells.

608314	TITLE *608314 SEPTIN 3; SEPT3
;;SEP3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SEPT3 belongs to the septin family of GTPases. In S. cerevisiae, septins
are required for cytokinesis.

CLONING

Using a cDNA isolated by Leypoldt et al. (2001) during a screen for
retinoic acid-induced genes, Methner et al. (2001) cloned SEPT3, which
they called SEP3, by PCR of differentiated NT2 neuronal precursor cell
cDNA. SEP3 shares almost 100% sequence identity with mouse
neuronal-specific septin-3 and rat brain-specific G-septin. Alternative
splicing leads to 3 SEP3 isoforms, SEP3A, SEP3B, and SEP3C, which encode
proteins of 345, 337, and 71 amino acids, respectively. SEP3A and SEP3B
contain a set of consensus sequence motifs for GTP binding, 2 predicted
phosphorylation sites for PKG, and a conserved binding motif for SH3
domain-containing proteins. In contrast to most other mammalian septins,
SEP3 does not have a predicted coiled-coil domain at its C terminus.
Northern blot analysis detected a 5-kb transcript only in adult brain.
Based on the size of the transcript, Methner et al. (2001) concluded
that SEP3B is the predominant isoform.

GENE FUNCTION

By quantitative PCR, Methner et al. (2001) determined that SEP3
expression was upregulated 2-fold in cDNA from induced NT2 cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Methner et al. (2001) determined that the SEP3 gene has 12 exons.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Leypoldt et al. (2001) and Methner et al. (2001)
mapped the SEP3 gene to chromosome 22q13.2.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Mediator is a multiprotein complex that can function in transcriptional
activation or repression depending on the factors with which it
interacts. The Mediator subunit MED12 has roles in both transcriptional
activation and repression (Ding et al., 2008).

CLONING

Nagase et al. (1996) cloned a cDNA, which they referred to as KIAA0192,
from the human cell line KG-1. They found that the cDNA contains
stretches of CAG (gln) repeats and encodes a 2,124-amino acid protein.

Using a HeLa cell line, Ito et al. (1999) cloned the same gene, TRAP230,
which encodes the 230-kD subunit of the thyroid hormone
receptor-associated protein (TRAP) complex (see 300182). The sequence of
the TRAP230 protein was found in 2 other reports of partial sequences:
CAG H45 (Margolis et al., 1997), and an opposite paired (OPA)-containing
protein called HOPA by Philibert et al. (1998) located on chromosome
Xq13. TRAP230 also contains 2 overlapping ligand-dependent nuclear
hormone receptor signature recognition motifs (LXXLL motifs) near the N
terminus and a highly glutamine-rich C-terminal region that results from
the CAG trinucleotide repeats. Sequence comparisons revealed that
TRAP230 also has significant homology with a hypothetical C. elegans
protein (CEF47A4). This protein has a regional identity of 23% and
similarity of 40% with TRAP230 and also possesses a characteristic
glutamine-rich sequence near the C terminus. Northern blot analysis of
multiple human tissues showed that the TRAP230 gene is ubiquitously
expressed as an approximately 7.6-kb transcript.

By Northern blot analysis of the HOPA gene transcript and its murine
ortholog, Mopa1, Philibert et al. (1999) demonstrated that only 1
transcript is expressed throughout the central nervous system and other
tissues, and that the transcript is highly expressed during early fetal
development. The presence of an OPA (opposite paired) element strongly
suggested that HOPA is under tissue- or developmental-specific control
(Grabowski et al., 1991).

GENE STRUCTURE

Philibert et al. (1999) sequenced the HOPA gene and found that it is 25
kb long and contains 44 exons. A promoter scan analysis demonstrated 2
possible transcription initiation sites without TATA boxes upstream from
the putative translation initiation start site. Risheg et al. (2007)
stated that the MED12 gene comprises 45 exons.

MAPPING

By use of human/rodent hybrid cell lines, Nagase et al. (1996) mapped
the MED12 gene to the X chromosome.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis of a human embryo cDNA expression library,
Zhou et al. (2002) found that the transcription activation domain of
SOX9 (608160) interacted with the proline-, glutamine-, and leucine-rich
(PQL) domain of TRAP230. In vitro and in vivo assays confirmed that the
proteins interact endogenously and associate with several other TRAP
complex proteins in HeLa cell nuclear lysates. SOX9 and TRAP230
colocalized in nuclei of cultured human embryo chondrocytes. The
isolated PQL domain of TRAP230 acted as a dominant-negative inhibitor of
SOX9 activity.

p21 (CDKN1A; 116899) is a key mediator of p53 (TP53; 191170)-dependent
cell cycle arrest. Donner et al. (2007) found that transcriptional
activity of the p21 promoter in human cell lines varied in response to
distinct p53-activating stimuli. Core Mediator subunits MED1 (PPARBP;
604311) and MED17 (603810) were recruited to the p21 gene regardless of
the p53-activating stimuli used. In contrast, 3 subunits of the CDK
module of Mediator, CDK8 (603184), MED12, and cyclin C (CCNC; 123838),
were recruited following treatment with nutlin-3, a nongenotoxic drug
that activates p53, but not in response to DNA damage induced by
ultraviolet light C.

Ding et al. (2008) showed that MED12 was required for transcriptional
repression of a subset of neuron-specific genes in human nonneuronal
cell lines, and that this repression was independent of CDK8 and CYCC.
Yeast 2-hybrid analysis showed that the C-terminal domain of MED12
interacted directly with the H3K9 histone methyltransferase G9A (EHMT2;
604599). Mutation analysis revealed that the pro-glu-leu (PQL) domain of
MED12 interacted with an ankyrin-repeat domain on G9A and, more weakly,
with a cys-rich domain on G9A. Purified HeLa cell Mediator complexes
that included MED12 interacted directly with G9A and REST (600571), a
gene repressor that functions through repressor element-1 (RE1).
Endogenous REST in HEK293 cells suppressed expression of a reporter gene
bearing RE1 sites, and knockdown of either MED12 or G9A abrogated the
suppression. Depletion of MED12 significantly reduced the association of
G9A with RE1 elements and decreased the level of H3K9 dimethylation by
G9A without influencing RE1 site occupancy by REST. Both the MED12
arg961-to-trp (R961W; 300188.0001) mutation associated with
Opitz-Kaveggia syndrome (305450) and the MED12 asn1007-to-ser (N1007S;
300188.0002) mutation associated with Lujan-Fryns syndrome (309520)
compromised recruitment of Mediator to RE1 elements and selectively
interfered with repression of REST target genes. Ding et al. (2008)
concluded that MED12 within the Mediator complex links REST with G9A in
epigenetic silencing of neuronal genes.

A class of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) termed noncoding RNA-activating
(ncRNA-a) functions to activate their neighboring genes using a
cis-mediated mechanism. Lai et al. (2013) reported that the depletion of
the components of the coactivator complex, Mediator, specifically and
potently diminished the noncoding RNA-induced activation of
transcription in a heterologous reporter assay using human HEK293 cells.
In vivo, Mediator is recruited to ncRNA-a target genes and regulates
their expression. Lai et al. (2013) showed that ncRNA-a interact with
Mediator to regulate its chromatin localization and kinase activity
towards histone H3 serine-10. The Mediator complex harboring
disease-causing MED12 mutations displayed diminished ability to
associate with activating ncRNAs. Chromosome conformation capture
confirmed the presence of DNA looping between the ncRNA-a loci and its
targets. Importantly, depletion of Mediator subunits or ncRNA-a reduced
the chromatin looping between the 2 loci. Lai et al. (2013) concluded
that their results identified the human Mediator complex as the
transducer of activating ncRNAs and highlighted the importance of
Mediator and activating ncRNA association in human disease.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Opitz-Kaveggia Syndrome

Opitz-Kaveggia syndrome (305450), also known as FG syndrome, is an
X-linked disorder characterized by mental retardation, relative
macrocephaly, hypotonia, and constipation. Risheg et al. (2007) reported
that the original family from which the designation FG was derived and 5
other families had a recurrent mutation in the MED12 gene, 2881C-T
(R961W; 300188.0001). MED12 was considered a candidate gene because of
its mapping to Xq13 and because it encodes a thyroid hormone
receptor-associated protein (TRAP). Risheg et al. (2007) sequenced the
45 exons of MED12 in 24 index cases from XLMR families with linkage to
Xq13. Two of the 24 index cases had the identical R961W missense
mutation. In both of these individuals, the diagnosis of Opitz-Kaveggia
syndrome had been made a priori. In all affected males who survived long
enough for mental or cognitive assessment, mental retardation was
present. Partial or complete absence of the corpus callosum was noted in
all 6 cases in which brain imaging was available. High, prominent
forehead and small, low-set, simple ears were the most consistent
craniofacial manifestations. Imperforate anus, wide flat thumbs, and
wide great toes were present in 7 of 10 cases. Cryptorchidism, inguinal
hernia, cardiac defects, and short stature were noted in fewer than half
of affected males. Risheg et al. (2007) proposed that the Opitz-Kaveggia
syndrome designation be reserved for those individuals with MED12
mutations.

- Lujan-Fryns Syndrome

In 4 affected members of a family with Lujan-Fryns syndrome (309520)
originally reported by Lujan et al. (1984), Schwartz et al. (2007)
identified a mutation in the MED12 gene (300188.0002). The same mutation
was found in affected members of an unrelated family. The findings
indicated that Lujan-Fryns syndrome and Opitz-Kaveggia syndrome are
allelic disorders. Clinically, Lujan-Fryns syndrome could be
distinguished by tall stature, hypernasal voice, hyperextensible digits,
and high nasal root. Schwartz et al. (2007) suggested that the
Lujan-Fryns syndrome designation be used only for those cases with a
compatible clinical phenotype and mutations in the MED12 gene.

- Ohdo Syndrome, X-linked

Vulto-van Silfhout et al. (2013) performed exome sequencing in 2
families segregating X-linked Ohdo syndrome (OHDOX; 300895), including
the family originally studied by Maat-Kievit et al. (1993) and another
family with 2 affected males, and identified hemizygous missense
mutations in the MED12 gene (R1148H, 300188.0003 and S1165P,
300188.0004) that segregated with the disorder in each family. By
analysis of an additional cohort of 9 simplex male patients with Ohdo
syndrome, they identified another MED12 missense mutation (H1729N;
300188.0005) in 1 patient.

Vulto-van Silfhout et al. (2013) comparatively examined siRNA-resistant
wildtype FLAG-tagged MED12 (FLAG-MED12) and its corresponding R1148H and
S1165P mutant derivatives for their respective abilities to suppress
enhanced REST target gene expression triggered by RNAi-mediated
depletion of endogenous MED12 in HEK293 cells. MED12 knockdown triggered
derepression of REST target genes, including CHRM4 (118495), SNAP25
(600322), and SYN1 (313440). Introduction of wildtype FLAG-MED12 in
these cells reversed this effect; in contrast, the R1148H and S1165P
mutants were significantly compromised in this ability. Vulto-van
Silfhout et al. (2013) also showed that neither amino acid change
deleteriously affected the incorporation of MED12 into Mediator or its
direct interaction with G9A, indicating that the MED12 mutations in Ohdo
syndrome do not disrupt the function of MED12 as a stable G9A interface
in Mediator.

- Susceptibility to Mental Retardation

Philibert et al. (1998) reported a strong association of a variant
polymorphism, a 12-bp duplication (CAGCAACACCAG), in the HOPA gene with
an X-linked mental retardation/hypothyroidism syndrome in several
independent cohorts.

Friez et al. (2000) concluded that the 12-bp duplication in the HOPA
gene is not associated with mental retardation. They determined the
incidence of the dodecamer duplication in cohorts of non-fragile X males
with mental retardation from 3 countries, cohorts of fragile X males
from 2 countries, 43 probands from families with X-linked mental
retardation, and control cohorts from 3 countries. The duplication was
found in 3.6 to 4.0% of male patients from 2 non-fragile X groups, in
1.2% from another non-fragile X group, but in no male patients from
families with X-linked mental retardation. The dodecamer duplication was
also found in several white males with fragile X syndrome from France
(5%) and South Africa (22.2%). Additionally, the duplication was found
in 1.5% of South Carolinian newborn males, 2.5% of South Carolinian male
college students, 5% of Italian male controls, and 4.5% of white South
African controls. The duplication appeared to be rare in the black South
African population. The incidence of the duplication was not
significantly different between any of the groups in the study.

A study by Beyer et al. (2002) also failed to sustain the hypothesis
that the HOPA gene is a significant susceptibility factor for infantile
autism and mental retardation. The 12-bp duplication in the HOPA gene
appeared to function as a benign polymorphism.

- Uterine Leiomyoma

Makinen et al. (2011) performed whole-exome sequencing on 18 uterine
leiomyomas derived from 17 different patients and identified
tumor-specific mutations in the MED12 gene in 10. Analysis of 207
additional tumors identified MED12 mutations in 70% (159/225) of tumors
from a total of 80 patients. The Mediator complex is a 26-subunit
transcriptional regulator that bridges DNA regulatory sequences to the
RNA polymerase II initiation complex. All mutations identified by
Makinen et al. (2011) resided in exon 2, suggesting that aberrant
function of this region of MED12 contributes to tumorigenesis.

ANIMAL MODEL

Hong et al. (2005) showed that med12-deficient zebrafish embryos showed
defects in brain, neural crest, and kidney development and do not
survive beyond 1 week after fertilization. Rau et al. (2006) showed,
also in zebrafish, that med12 is required as a coactivator of Sox9
(608160)-dependent neural crest, cartilage, and ear development.
Mutations in med12 are responsible for the zebrafish mutant 'motionless'
(mot), and med12 transcripts are enriched in brain, where the gene is
responsible for regulating the expression of other neuronal
determination genes (Wang et al., 2006). These and other studies
suggested that a variety of signaling pathways interact with MED12.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
OPITZ-KAVEGGIA SYNDROME
MED12, ARG961TRP

In the original family with what was designated the FG syndrome (305450)
after the family initials, Risheg et al. (2007) found a 2881C-T
transition in exon 21 of the MED12 gene that caused an arg961-to-trp
amino acid substitution (R961W). They also found the same mutation in 5
other families. Failure to find the change in 451 normal men and in 343
consecutive newborn males suggested that it is not a rare polymorphic
variant. The finding of the mutation in patients of various ethnic
backgrounds suggested that families did not share a common ancestor.

Ding et al. (2008) showed that both the R961W mutation associated with
Opitz-Kaveggia syndrome and the MED12 asn1007-to-ser (N1007S;
300188.0002) mutation associated with Lujan-Fryns syndrome (309520)
compromised recruitment of Mediator to RE1 elements and selectively
interfered with repression of REST (600571) target genes. The authors
noted that these mutations do not alter the ability of MED12 to support
beta-catenin (see CTNNB1; 116806) transactivation.

.0002
LUJAN-FRYNS SYNDROME
MED12, ASN1007SER

In 4 affected members of a family with Lujan-Fryns syndrome (309520)
originally reported by Lujan et al. (1984), Schwartz et al. (2007)
identified a 3020A-G transition in exon 22 of the MED12 gene, resulting
in an asn1007-to-ser (N1007S) substitution. Affected members of an
unrelated family carried the same mutation.

Ding et al. (2008) showed that both the N1007S mutation associated with
Lujan-Fryns syndrome and the MED12 arg961-to-trp (R961W; 300188.0001)
mutation associated with Opitz-Kaveggia syndrome (305450) compromised
recruitment of Mediator to RE1 elements and selectively interfered with
repression of REST (600571) target genes. The authors noted that these
mutations do not alter the ability of MED12 to support beta-catenin (see
CTNNB1; 116806) transactivation.

.0003
OHDO SYNDROME, X-LINKED
MED12, ARG1148HIS

By exome sequencing in a family in which 2 males had Ohdo syndrome
(OHDOX; 300895), originally described by Maat-Kievit et al. (1993) and
Verloes et al. (2006), Vulto-van Silfhout et al. (2013) identified a
hemizygous c.3443G-A transition in the MED12 gene, resulting in an
arg1148-to-his (R1148H) substitution, that segregated with the
phenotype. Arg1148 is a highly conserved residue, and the mutation was
predicted to be damaging to protein function.

.0004
OHDO SYNDROME, X-LINKED
MED12, SER1165PRO

By exome sequencing in a family in which 2 males had Ohdo syndrome
(OHDOX; 300895), Vulto-van Silfhout et al. (2013) identified a
hemizygous c.3493T-C transition in the MED12 gene, resulting in a
ser1165-to-pro (S1165P) substitution, that segregated with the
phenotype. Ser1165 is a highly conserved residue, and the mutation was
predicted to be damaging to protein function.

.0005
OHDO SYNDROME, X-LINKED
MED12, HIS1729ASN

Vulto-van Silfhout et al. (2013) sequenced the MED12 in a cohort of 9
simplex male individuals with Ohdo syndrome (OHDOX; 300895) and
identified a hemizygous de novo c.5185C-A transversion, resulting in a
his1729-to-asn (H1729N) substitution in the PQL domain. His1729 is a
highly conserved residue, and the mutation was predicted to be damaging
to protein function.

159558	TITLE *159558 MYELOID/LYMPHOID OR MIXED LINEAGE LEUKEMIA, TRANSLOCATED TO, 3; MLLT3
;;MIXED LINEAGE LEUKEMIA, TRANSLOCATED TO, 3;;
ALL1-FUSED GENE FROM CHROMOSOME 9; AF9
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Nakamura et al. (1993) cloned and sequenced cDNAs derived from
transcripts of the AF4 (159557) and AF9 genes involved in the chromosome
abnormalities t(4;11)(q21;q23) and t(9;11)(p22;q23), respectively. They
found that the AF4 and AF9 genes, each of which fuses with the ALL1 gene
(159555) in leukemia-associated translocations, show high sequence
homology with the ENL gene (159556) on chromosome 19, which is fused to
the ALL1 gene in patients with leukemia and the translocation
t(11;19)(q23;p13). They found further that the protein products of the
AF4, AF9, and ENL genes contained nuclear targeting sequences as well as
serine-rich and proline-rich regions. Stretches abundant in basic amino
acids were also present in the 3 proteins. These results indicated that
the different proteins fused to ALL1 polypeptides in leukemia provide
similar functional domains. The AF9 gene is also symbolized MLLT3.

GENE STRUCTURE

Strissel et al. (2000) noted that the AF9 gene is more than 100 kb, and
2 patient breakpoint cluster regions (BCRs) have been identified; BCR1
is within intron 4, previously called site A, whereas BCR2 or site B
spans introns 7 and 8. Strissel et al. (2000) defined the exon-intron
boundaries and identified several different structural elements in AF9,
including a colocalizing in vivo DNA topo II cleavage site and an in
vitro DNase I hypersensitive (DNase 1 HS) site in intron 7 in BCR2.
Reversibility experiments demonstrated a religation of the topo II
cleavage sites. In addition, 2 scaffold associated regions (SARs) are
located centromeric to the topo II and DNase I HS cleavage sites and
border breakpoint regions in 2 leukemic cells lines: SAR1 is located in
intron 4, whereas SAR2 encompasses parts of exons 5-7. The authors thus
demonstrated that the patient breakpoint regions of AF9 share the same
structural elements as the MLL BCR, and they proposed a DNA breakage and
repair model for nonhomologous recombination between MLL and its partner
genes, particularly AF9.

CYTOGENETICS

The human AF9 gene is one of the most common fusion partner genes with
the ALL1 gene at 11q23 (also called MLL), resulting in the
t(9;11)(p22;q23) (Nakamura et al., 1993; Strissel et al., 2000).

In a 6-year-old girl with neuromotor developmental delay, cerebellar
ataxia, and epilepsy, Pramparo et al. (2005) identified a constitutional
translocation t(4;9)(q35;p22) disrupting the MLLT3 gene. Pramparo et al.
(2005) stated that this was the first report of the MLLT3 gene involved
in a nonfusion balanced translocation, suggesting a haploinsufficiency
model associated with this patient's phenotype.

GENE FUNCTION

Krivtsov et al. (2006) showed that leukemia stem cells can maintain the
global identity of the progenitor from which they arose while activating
a limited stem-cell- or self-renewal-associated program. They isolated
leukemia stem cells from leukemias initiated in committed granulocyte
macrophage progenitors through introduction of the MLL-AF9 fusion
protein encoded by the t(9;11)(p22;q23). The leukemia stem cells were
capable of transferring leukemia to secondary recipient mice when only 4
cells were transferred, and possessed an immunophenotype and global gene
expression profile very similar to that of normal granulocyte macrophage
progenitors. However, a subset of genes highly expressed in normal
hematopoietic stem cells was reactivated in leukemic stem cells.
Leukemic stem cells can thus be generated from committed progenitors
without widespread reprogramming of gene expression, and a leukemia
self-renewal-associated signature is activated in the process. Krivtsov
et al. (2006) concluded that their findings define progression from
normal progenitor to cancer stem cell, and suggest that targeting a
self-renewal program expressed in an abnormal context may be possible.

604414	TITLE *604414 POLYMERASE II, RNA, SUBUNIT F; POLR2F
;;RPB6, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF;;
RNA POLYMERASE II, 14.4-KD SUBUNIT
DESCRIPTION The DNA-dependent RNA polymerase II (EC 2.7.7.6) is responsible for the
transcription of protein-encoding genes. It is composed of 10 to 14
subunits ranging in mass from approximately 220 kD (POLR2A; 180660) to
approximately 7 kD (POLR2K; 606033). For general information on the
structure and function of RNA polymerase II, see 180660.

CLONING

By screening a HeLa cell cDNA library with probes obtained using a
partial POLR2F cDNA sequence (Adams et al., 1991), Acker et al. (1994)
isolated cDNAs representing the entire coding sequence of the RNA
polymerase II subunit POLR2F, which they called RPB14.4. The deduced
127-amino acid POLR2F protein has a calculated molecular mass of
approximately 14.4 kD. It is highly acidic, with a calculated
isoelectric point of 3.7. POLR2F contains a predicted C-terminal leucine
zipper domain, which is not preceded by a basic domain. The POLR2F
protein shares 49% sequence identity with the S. cerevisiae polymerase
subunit ABC23, with the C-terminal regions showing the highest
conservation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Pusch et al. (1996) found that the POLR2F gene spans 13,083 bp and
contains 5 exons.

MAPPING

Pusch et al. (1996) identified the POLR2F cDNA sequence within a cosmid
that maps to 22q13.1. They stated that the POLR2F gene is located no
more than 600 kb from the PDGFB gene (190040).

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Cramer et al. (2000) derived a backbone model of a 10-subunit yeast RNA
polymerase II using x-ray diffraction data extending to 3-angstrom
resolution. All 10 subunits exhibited a high degree of identity with the
corresponding human proteins, and 9 of the 10 subunits are conserved
among the 3 eukaryotic RNA polymerases I, II, and III. Notable features
of the model include a pair of jaws, formed by subunits Rpb1 (180660),
Rpb5 (180664), and Rpb9 (180662), that appear to grip DNA downstream of
the active center. A clamp on the DNA nearer the active center, formed
by Rpb1, Rpb2 (180661), and Rpb6 (homologous to human POLR2F), may be
locked in the closed position by RNA, accounting for the great stability
of transcribing complexes. A pore in the protein complex beneath the
active center may allow entry of substrates for polymerization and exit
of the transcript during proofreading and passage through pause sites in
the DNA.

612911	TITLE *612911 NADH DEHYDROGENASE 1 ALPHA SUBCOMPLEX, ASSEMBLY FACTOR 3; NDUFAF3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Hartmann and Stamm (1997) cloned rat Ndufaf3, which they called E3-3,
and identified the human ortholog by EST database analysis. RT-PCR
detected E3-3 expression in all rat tissues examined, with highest
expression in testis.

Using human SOB1 (AKAP3; 604689) in a low-stringency screen of a mouse
germinal cell cDNA library, Hammami-Hamza et al. (2003) cloned mouse
Ndufaf3, which they called 2P1. Northern blot analysis detected
expression only in mouse testis. In situ hybridization detected 2P1 in
stage I pachytene spermatocytes, and expression persisted until stage
XII of the spermatogenic cycle. No expression was detected in
interstitial tissue.

Saada et al. (2009) stated that the NDUFAF3 gene encodes 2 isoforms, A
and B, which share a 'domain of unknown function' (DUF498). The longer A
isoform harbors a predicted N-terminal mitochondrial-targeting sequence
of about 35 amino acids.

GENE STRUCTURE

The NDUFAF3 gene contains 4 exons (Saada et al., 2009).

MAPPING

Hartz (2009) mapped the NDUFAF3 gene to chromosome 3p21.31 based on an
alignment of the NDUFAF3 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AL049955) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.1).

GENE FUNCTION

Using subcellular fractionation experiments, Saada et al. (2009) showed
that NDUFAF3 was predominantly localized to mitochondria and remained in
the pellet after carbonate extraction, suggesting a strong interaction
with the mitochondrial membrane, although NDUFAF3 has no predicted
transmembrane helices. Localization appeared identical to that of
NDUFAF4 (611776). RNA interference studies indicated that the NDUFAF3
gene product is necessary for mitochondrial complex I assembly. The
activity of NDUFAF3 showed functional interdependence with NDUFAF4. Gene
conservation analysis linked NDUFAF3 to the bacterial-membrane-insertion
gene cluster SecF/SecD/YajC and C8ORF38 (612392), suggesting a
translation-dependent early assembly mechanism.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 5 patients with severe mitochondrial complex I deficiency (252010)
and lactic acidosis, Saada et al. (2009) identified homozygous or
compound heterozygous mutations in the NDUFAF3 gene
(612911.0001-612911.0003). All patients died before age 6 months.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX I DEFICIENCY
NDUFAF3, GLY77ARG

In 3 Muslim sibs with severe mitochondrial complex I deficiency (252010)
resulting in death by age 3 months, Saada et al. (2009) identified a
homozygous 229G-C transversion in the NDUFAF3 gene, resulting in a
gly77-to-arg (G77R) substitution. The parents were consanguineous.

.0002
MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX I DEFICIENCY
NDUFAF3, ARG122PRO

In a male infant with severe mitochondrial complex I deficiency
(252010), Saada et al. (2009) identified a homozygous 365G-C
transversion in the NDUFAF3 gene, resulting in an arg122-to-pro (R122P)
substitution at the C-terminal end of the protein. The child was born of
consanguineous Arab Muslim parents. At 3 weeks of age, he became
hypoactive and sucked poorly. Physical examination revealed
macrocephaly, a weak cry, wide anterior fontanel, and axial hypotonia.
He had intermittent generalized tonic movements, and funduscopy showed
pallor of the optic discs. At 3 months of age, there was no eye contact
and marked axial hypotonia with brisk tendon reflexes. He died at age 4
months.

.0003
MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX I DEFICIENCY
NDUFAF3, MET1THR

In a female infant with severe mitochondrial complex I deficiency
(252010), Saada et al. (2009) identified compound heterozygosity for
mutation in the NDUFAF3 gene: a 2T-C transition, resulting in a
met1-to-thr (M1T) substitution, and the R122P (612911.0002) mutation.
She was the daughter of unrelated parents of Jewish origin. At age 3
months, she developed myoclonic seizures, and brain MRI revealed diffuse
brain leukomalacia. She died at age 6 months of respiratory failure.
Complex I activity was markedly decreased.

600367	TITLE *600367 CLEAVAGE STIMULATION FACTOR, 3-PRIME PRE-RNA, SUBUNIT 3, 77-KD; CSTF3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Polyadenylation of mRNA precursors is a complex process that requires
multiple protein factors, including cleavage stimulation factor (CSTF),
a cleavage-polyadenylation specificity factor (see 603052), 2 cleavage
factors, and poly(A)+ polymerase. CSTF is composed of 3 subunits: CSTF1
(600369), CSFT2 (300907), and CSTF3 (Takagaki and Manley, 1994).

CLONING

Takagaki and Manley (1994) cloned human CSTF3, which encodes a 77-kD
protein homologous to Drosophila 'suppressor of forked' (suf) and yeast
Rna14, both of which are involved in mRNA processing.

By searching for genes in a region of chromosome 11 associated with WAGR
syndrome (194072), Gawin et al. (1999) identified and cloned CSTF3.
Northern blot analysis of several human tissues detected a 3.2-kb
transcript predominantly in lung. In mouse, Cstf3 expression was strong
during embryonic development beginning at embryonic day 11 and much
weaker in adult tissues.

MAPPING

By analysis of a PAC contig covering chromosome 11p14.1-p13, Gawin et
al. (1999) mapped the CSTF3 gene to chromosome 11p13, centromeric to the
TR2 gene (DEPDC7; 612294) and telomeric to the G2 gene (C11ORF41;
612297).

606304	TITLE *606304 PROTOCADHERIN-GAMMA, SUBFAMILY B, MEMBER 7; PCDHGB7
;;PCDH-GAMMA-B7
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Cadherins are calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion molecules, and
protocadherins constitute a subfamily of nonclassic cadherins. PCDHGB7
is 1 of 22 tandemly arranged genes within the PCDHG gene cluster
(604968) on chromosome 5q31. The 22 PCDHG genes function as 'variable'
exons that are individually spliced to a downstream constant region to
form distinct PCDHG transcripts. The variable PCDHG exons encode the
extracellular and transmembrane domains of the protocadherin protein,
and the common region encodes the intracellular domain (Wu et al.,
2001). For further information on the PCDHG genes, see 604968.

CLONING

Using PCR with degenerate primers to screen melanoma cell lines,
Matsuyoshi et al. (1997) obtained a cDNA fragment encoding part of
PCDHGB7, which they termed ME6. RT-PCR analysis detected expression of
ME6 in 2 melanoma cell lines, a squamous cell carcinoma cell line, and
normal fibroblasts and melanocytes.

By PCR of a brain cDNA library, Wu and Maniatis (1999) cloned
full-length PCDHGB7.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Wu et al. (2001) mapped the PCDHGB7 gene
to chromosome 5q31, between the PCDHGA10 gene (606297) and the PCDHGA11
gene (606298). They localized the mouse PCDHG genes to chromosome 18c.

604657	TITLE *604657 TRANSMEMBRANE 4 SUPERFAMILY, MEMBER 5; TM4SF5
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

See TM4SF6 (300191) for general information on members of the
transmembrane 4 superfamily (TM4SF).

CLONING

By screening for genes differentially expressed in pancreatic tumors and
normal pancreatic tissue, Gress et al. (1996) identified TM4SF5, a gene
that was highly overexpressed in pancreatic cancer. Muller-Pillasch et
al. (1998) isolated a cDNA representing a full-length TM4SF5 coding
sequence. The predicted 197-amino acid TM4SF5 protein contains 4
transmembrane domains, with a large extracellular domain containing 2
potential N-glycosylation sites located between transmembrane domains 3
and 4. Like other TM4SF proteins, TM4SF5 is cysteine-rich. TM4SF5 shares
50% amino acid identity with the tumor-associated antigen L6 (TM4SF1;
191155). Northern blot analysis of various normal human tissues, namely
intestine, pancreas, stomach, colon, esophagus, bladder, uterus,
placenta, and adipose tissue, detected TM4SF5 expression only in
intestine and 1 of 14 pancreas samples. TM4SF5 was overexpressed in 13
of 14 pancreatic adenocarcinomas, as compared with both normal
pancreatic and chronic pancreatitis tissues. TM4SF5 expression was also
found in 2 of 2 gastric cancers, 1 of 2 colon carcinomas, 1 of 1
carcinoma of the papilla vateri, and 1 of 1 soft-tissue sarcoma. TM4SF5
was expressed as an approximately 1-kb transcript in the pancreatic
tumors.

The POMC gene (176830) is occasionally expressed in nonpituitary tumors
leading to Cushing syndrome (219080). Bronchial carcinoid tumors, one of
the most frequent sources for ectopic ACTH secretion, often display
numerous features of the corticotroph phenotype. To identify new markers
of corticotroph differentiation in these tumors, Le Tallec et al. (2002)
compared the pattern of POMC expression in ACTH-secreting (ACTH+) and
nonsecreting (ACTH-) bronchial carcinoids by differential
display/RT-PCR. In ACTH+ tumors, beside the expected POMC gene, they
identified cFos and KIAA1775, a large expressed sequence tag encoding a
putative protocadherin-related protein. On the other hand, the
tetraspanin TM4SF5 gene was specifically expressed in ACTH- tumors. The
authors concluded that corticotroph differentiation of bronchial
carcinoid tumors is accompanied by induction and repression of specific
genes.

GENE FUNCTION

Lee et al. (2008) found that expression of TM4SF5 was upregulated in
human hepatocarcinomas and that expression in clinical samples and
hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines correlated with enhanced p27(Kip1)
(CDKN1B; 600778) expression and cytosolic stabilization, and morphologic
elongation mediated by RhoA (ARHA; 165390) inactivation. These
TM4SF5-mediated effects resulted in epithelial-mesenchymal transition
(EMT) via loss of E-cadherin (CDH1; 192090) expression, leading to
aberrant cell growth, anchorage-independent growth, and tumor formation
in nude mice. Suppressing TM4SF5 or cytosolic p27(Kip1) expression or
reconstituting E-cadherin expression abolished these effects.

MAPPING

By analysis of a somatic cell hybrid mapping panel, Muller-Pillasch et
al. (1998) mapped the TM4SF5 gene to chromosome 17. They localized the
TM4SF5 gene to 17p13.3 using a radiation hybrid mapping panel.

600744	TITLE *600744 T-CELL TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR EB; TFEB
;;TCFEB
TFEB/ALPHA FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Transcription factors of the basic helix-loop-helix zipper (bHLH-ZIP)
family contain a basic domain, used for DNA binding, and HLH and ZIP
domains, both used for oligomerization. TFEB was isolated from a human
B-cell cDNA library using a binding sequence from the adenovirus major
late promoter (Carr and Sharp, 1990).

MAPPING

By interspecific backcross analysis, Steingrimsson et al. (1995) mapped
the Tcfeb gene in the mouse to chromosome 17 in a region of homology to
human 6p21, which can be presumed to be the location of the human
homolog.

CYTOGENETICS

Argani et al. (2001) identified a class of renal tumors containing a
translocation t(6;11)(p21.1;q12). Whereas these tumors exhibited
epitheloid morphology suggestive of renal carcinoma, they were
distinctive in their nonimmunoreactivity for epithelial markers
(cytokeratin, epithelial membrane antigen) and positive immunoreactivity
for melanocytic markers. Davis et al. (2003) reported that TFEB is
targeted by this translocation in both of 2 tumors examined. TFEB fuses
with the Alpha gene at 11q13, an intronless gene that does not
contribute coding sequence to the fusion product. In the 2 primary
tumors the Alpha gene rearranged with the first intron of TFEB, just
upstream of TFEB's initiation ATG, preserving the entire TFEB coding
sequence. Fluorescence in situ hybridization confirmed the involvement
of both TFEB and Alpha in this translocation. Although the Alpha
promoter drives expression of this fusion gene, the Alpha gene does not
contribute to the ORF.

Whereas TFE3 (314310) is typically fused to partner proteins in subsets
of renal tumors, Davis et al. (2003) found that wildtype, unfused TFE3
stimulates clonogenic growth in a cell-based assay, suggesting that
dysregulated expression, rather than altered function of TFEB or TFE3
fusions, may confer neoplastic properties, a mechanism reminiscent of
MYC (190080) activation by promoter substitution in Burkitt lymphoma.
Alpha-TFEB is thus identified as a fusion gene in a subset of renal
neoplasms in children and young adults. Two patients studied by Davis et
al. (2003) were an 18-year-old female with a history of obesity,
hirsutism, and polycystic ovary syndrome. A right renal mass was
detected, and partial nephrectomy was performed. Postoperatively, she
was well without evidence of recurrent neoplastic disease and continued
to require spironolactone for control of hirsutism. The second patient
was an 18-year-old male with clinical details reported by Argani et al.
(2001).

Kuiper et al. (2003) collected 3 cases of renal cell carcinoma (RCC;
605074) from patients 14 to 42 years of age, wherein a t(6;11)(p21;q13)
translocation was the sole cytogenetic abnormality. Molecular analysis
revealed fusion of the TFEB gene on chromosome 6 to the Alpha gene
(607924) on chromosome 11. The Alpha/TFEB fusion gene linked all coding
exons of the TFEB gene to 5-prime upstream regulatory sequences of the
Alpha gene. Alpha/TFEB mRNA levels were significantly upregulated in
primary tumor cells as compared with wildtype TFEB mRNA levels in normal
kidney samples, resulting in a dramatic upregulation of TFEB protein
levels. The TFEB protein encoded by the Alpha/TFEB fusion gene was
efficiently targeted to the nucleus. Kuiper et al. (2003) speculated
that this resulted in severely unbalanced nuclear ratios of MITF
(156845)/TFE subfamily members and that this imbalance may lead to
changes in the expression of downstream target genes, ultimately
resulting in the development of RCC.

GENE FUNCTION

Sardiello et al. (2009) found that most lysosomal genes exhibit
coordinated transcription behavior and are regulated by the
transcription factor EB (TFEB). They found that 68 of 96 lysosomal genes
had a palindromic 10-bp GTCACGTGAC motif, either as a single sequence or
as tandem multiple copies, in the 5-prime untranslated region. Sardiello
et al. (2009) named this motif the Coordinated Lysosomal Expression and
Regulation (CLEAR) element. Under aberrant lysosomal storage conditions,
TFEB translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, resulting in the
activation of its target genes. TFEB overexpression in cultured cells
induced lysosomal biogenesis and increased degradation of complex
molecules such as glucosaminoglycans and polyQ-expanded huntingtin.

Settembre et al. (2011) found that starvation activates a
transcriptional program that controls major steps of the autophagic
pathway, including autophagosome formation, autophagosome-lysosome
fusion, and substrate degradation. The transcription factor EB, the
master gene for lysosomal biogenesis, coordinated this program by
driving expression of autophagy and lysosomal genes. Nuclear
localization and activity of TFEB were regulated by serine
phosphorylation mediated by the extracellular signal-regulated kinase-2
(ERK2; 176948), whose activity was tuned by the levels of extracellular
nutrients. Thus, Settembre et al. (2011) concluded that a
mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent mechanism regulates autophagy
by controlling the biogenesis and partnership of 2 distinct cellular
organelles.

RH-NULL DISEASE, AMORPH TYPE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION Rh, elliptocytosis, PGM1, and 6PGD are all on the same chromosome. The
first 2 loci appear to lie between the latter 2 (Renwick, 1971).
Information from cell hybridization studies placed the
Rh-elliptocytosis-PGM(1)-6PGD linkage group on chromosome 1. Jacobs et
al. (1970) reported data suggesting a loose linkage between a
translocation breakpoint near the end of the long arm of chromosome 1
and Rh. Lamm et al. (1970) published family data consistent with loose
linkage of Duffy and PGM1. Renwick (1971) suggested that PGM1 is on the
side of Rh, remote from 6PGD and about 30 centimorgans from Rh. Cook et
al. (1972) confirmed this interval. Although the Rh and Duffy loci are
both on chromosome 1, they are too far apart to demonstrate linkage in
family studies (Sanger et al., 1973). Marsh et al. (1974) found
Rh-negative erythrocytes in an Rh-positive man suffering from
myelofibrosis. Nucleated hemopoietic precursors were circulating in his
blood, and these cells had an abnormal chromosome complement from which
part of the short arm of chromosome 1 had been deleted. They concluded
that the Rh locus probably lies on the distal segment of the short arm
at some point between 1p32 and the end of the short arm. The conclusion
is consistent with the finding of Douglas et al. (1973) that the PGM1
locus, which is linked to Rh, is on the short arm of chromosome 1. Since
the patient of Marsh et al. (1974) did not have deletion of the PGM1
locus in the mutant clone, the Rh locus is probably distal to the PGM1
locus. Corney et al. (1977) observed only 1 recombination in 58
opportunities between the alpha-fucosidase locus (FUCA1; 612280) and the
Rh locus. Rh antigen still eludes chemical definition (Tippett, 1978),
but it is thought to be a lipoprotein. No completely certain example of
recombination within a postulated gene complex has been described.
Steinberg (1965) described a Hutterite family in which the father was
CDe-cde, mother cde-cde, 4 children cde-cde, 3 children CDe-cde, and 1
child (the 6th born) Cde-cde. Steinberg (1965) thought this was an
instance of crossing-over. Mutation and, much less likely, a recessive
suppressor of the D antigen were mentioned as other possibilities. Race
and Sanger (1975) considered a recessive suppressor likely.
(Illegitimacy was excluded by the mores of the sect and by marker
studies.) Rosenfield (1981) wrote: 'We still know nothing about Rh.
Except for Steinberg's one crossover, there have been no exceptions to
the inheritance of Rh antigens in tight haplotype packages. Hopefully,
Rh antigen will be isolated for characterisation but there has been
nothing published since the report of Plapp et al. (1979).' Steinberg et
al. (1984) reexamined the Hutterite family, making use of other markers
thought to be on 1p (6PGD, Colton, UMPK1) and concluded that crossover
or mutation indeed had occurred. (Colton is probably not on chromosome
1p; UMPK1 was not informative in the critical parent (Lewis, 1989).)
They concluded further that if, as seems likely from other evidence, C
lies between D and E, their data indicate that the D gene (116800) is
distal (telomeric) in the Rh complex. This order is consistent with the
rare Rh haplotype D. Race et al. (1950, 1951) considered this haplotype
to represent a probable or possible deletion in a human Rh chromosome.
Race and Sanger (1975) listed 20 homozygotes for this haplotype.
Originating from various populations, they were, in about 80% of the
cases, the products of consanguineous matings. Olafsdottir et al. (1983)
concluded that this Rhesus haplotype is not very rare in Iceland. They
estimated the frequency to be about 1 in 214 persons. They discovered
the haplotype in 2 unrelated women because of difficulty with
crossmatching. Both had formed Rh antibodies, one provoked by
transfusions and the other by 3 pregnancies.

Saboori et al. (1988) purified Rh protein in relatively large amounts
from Rh(D)-positive and -negative blood. Differences in the peptide maps
of the 2 proteins were found. Blanchard et al. (1988) presented indirect
data based on immunologic and biochemical investigations demonstrating
that the Rh D, c, and E polypeptides of the erythrocyte membrane are
homologous but distinct molecular species that can be physically
separated and analyzed. These polypeptides have a molecular weight of
about 32,000. Polypeptides c and E were found by Blanchard et al. (1988)
to be more closely related to each other than to D. All the observations
were consistent with partial divergence among homologous members of a
family of Rh proteins. In a review completed in early 1988, Issitt
(1988) suggested that current molecular genetic methods could finally
end 50 years of speculation as to the genetic determination of the Rh
blood groups. Cherif-Zahar et al. (1990) isolated cDNA clones encoding a
human blood group Rh polypeptide from a human bone marrow cDNA library
using a PCR amplified DNA fragment encoding the known common N-terminal
region of the Rh proteins. Translation of the open reading frame
indicated that the Rh protein is composed of 417 amino acids, including
the initiator methionine, which is removed in the mature protein, that
it lacks a cleavable N-terminal sequence, and that it has no consensus
site for potential N-glycosylation. Hydropathy analysis and predictions
of secondary structure suggested the presence of 13 membrane-spanning
domains, indicating that the Rh polypeptide is highly hydrophobic and
deeply buried within the phospholipid bilayer. In Northern analysis, the
Rh cDNA probe detected a major 1.7-kb and a minor 3.5-kb mRNA species in
erythroid tissues but not in adult liver and kidney tissues or lymphoid
and promyelocytic cell lines. By in situ hybridization using an Rh
protein probe, Cherif-Zahar et al. (1991) mapped the Rh gene to
1p36.1-p34.3.

Whether the 3 sets of Rh antigens--D, Cc, and Ee--that are inherited en
bloc represent separate epitopes on a single protein (as maintained by
Wiener, 1944) or multiple independent proteins encoded by closely linked
genes (as first suggested by Fisher in 1944 (Race, 1944)) has been
controversial since the discovery of the Rh antigens in the early 1940s.
Cherif-Zahar et al. (1990) quoted work of Blanchard et al. (1988)
suggesting that the Rh D, c, and E antigens are carried by 3 distinct
but homologous membrane proteins that share a common N-terminal protein
sequence. It is possible that these are the product of one gene with
multiple splicing alternatives. See also review by Agre and Cartron
(1991). Colin et al. (1991) used Rh cDNA as a probe in Southern analysis
of the Rh locus. They demonstrated that in all Rh D-positive persons 2
strongly related Rh genes are present per haploid genome, whereas 1 of
these 2 genes is missing in Rh D-negative donors. Colin et al. (1991)
concluded that 1 of the 2 genes of the Rh locus encodes the Rh C/c and
Rh E/e polypeptides while the other encodes the Rh D protein. (Both
Fisher and Wiener were partly right.) The absence of any D gene and of
its postulated allelic form d in the Rh D-negative genome explains why
no Rh d antigen has ever been demonstrated.

Using cDNAs amplified from reticulocyte mRNA, Mouro et al. (1993)
investigated CcEe gene differences in Rh-negative individuals homozygous
for dCe, dcE, and dce haplotypes. The RNA analysis was followed by PCR
amplification of specific exons using genomic DNA from donors carrying a
range of common Rh haplotypes. The Ee polypeptide was shown to be
synthesized from the full-length transcript of the CcEe gene and to be
identical in length (417 residues) and very similar in sequence to the D
polypeptide. The Cc polypeptides were synthesized from shorter
transcripts of the same CcEe gene sequence, but spliced so as to exclude
exons 4, 5, and 6 or exons 4, 5 and 8. In both cases, the residue at 226
in exon 5 associated with Ee antigenicity was omitted from the
polypeptide product; see 111700.0001 and 111700.0002. Also see review by
Hopkinson (1993).

The Rh-null phenotype is of 2 types. The most common type, called the
'regulator type,' occurs by an inhibition mechanism; see 268150. This
form is caused by homozygosity for an autosomal recessive suppressor
gene that is genetically independent of the Rh locus, mapping to
chromosome 3 rather than to chromosome 1. The second type of Rh-null,
which was first described in a Japanese family (Ishimori and Hasekura,
1967), is called the 'amorph type' and results from homozygosity for a
silent allele at the Rh locus. In a survey of 42 examples of the Rh-null
phenotype, Nash and Shojania (1987) found that only 5 were of the amorph
type. Perez-Perez et al. (1992) described a Spanish family in which a
silent Rh gene was segregating, giving rise to the amorph type of
Rh-null in the proposita whose parents were first cousins. She suffered
from severe hemolytic anemia. Western blot analysis carried out with
glycosylation-independent antibodies directed against the Rh polypeptide
and the LW glycoprotein, respectively, confirmed that these protein
components were absent from the red cells of the proposita.

Investigations by Cherif-Zahar et al. (1993) failed to reveal any
alteration of the RH genes and transcripts in Rh-null of the silent
type, and they suspected that these variants have a transcriptional or
post-transcriptional alteration of RH genes. Cherif-Zahar et al. (1996)
analyzed the RH locus and sequenced the Rh transcripts from 5
Rh-deficient phenotypes caused by an autosomal suppressor gene (reg and
mod types). They were unable to detect any abnormality; these variants
did not express RH genes but did convey a functional RH locus from one
generation to the next. They also detected no gross alteration in the
CD47 gene structure; transcripts were easily amplified and the
nucleotide sequence was identical to that from controls. This agreed
with binding studies indicating that CD47 is present on the red cell
surface of Rh-deficient cells, although severely reduced (10-15% of
controls). In general, their findings suggested that the low expression
of CD47 on Rh-null erythrocytes results from the defective assembly or
transport to the cell surface when Rh proteins are absent.

Cherif-Zahar et al. (1994) demonstrated that the RHCE gene has 10 exons
distributed over 75 kb. Exons 4 to 8 are alternatively spliced in the
different RNA isoforms. Primary extension analysis indicated that the
transcription initiation site is located 83 bp upstream of the
initiation codon. Study of hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic (HeLa)
cell lines and Northern blot analysis suggested that the expression of
the RH locus is restricted to the erythroid/megakaryocytic lineage.
Consistent with this, putative binding sites for SP1, GATA-1, and Ets
proteins, nuclear factors known to be involved in erythroid and
megakaryocytic gene expression, were identified in the promoter of the
RHCE gene.

Data on gene frequencies of allelic variants were tabulated by
Roychoudhury and Nei (1988).

Mollison (1994) reviewed the genetic basis of the Rh blood group system,
giving a brief survey of the early history. Rosenfield (1989) had
described the bitter disagreements between Wiener and Levine,
particularly over priority of discovery. Mollison (1994) reviewed the
disagreement between A. S. Wiener, who postulated multiple alleles at a
single locus (Wiener, 1943), and R. A. Fisher, who interpreted the data
of R. R. Race (1944) as most compatible with the existence of 3 closely
linked genes. Cartron and Agre (1993) reviewed the protein and gene
structure of the Rh blood group antigens. In summary, Rh-positive
persons have 2 Rh genes, 1 encoding the Cc- and Ee-bearing protein or,
more likely, proteins, and a second encoding the D-bearing protein,
while Rh-negative persons have only 1 Rh gene, the first of the 2
described above.

Cartron et al. (1995) defended the 2-gene model of the Rh blood group
system. They suggested that the RHCE gene encodes the C/c and E/e
proteins through alternative splicing of the primary transcript.
D-positive and D-negative individuals differ on the basis of the
presence or absence of the RHD gene (111680), as a rule; in some
Australian Aborigines and Blacks, a fragment of the RHD gene or a
nonfunctional RHD gene is present. Smythe et al. (1996) found that both
c and E antigens were expressed after transduction of K562 cells with a
single cDNA, indicating that the c antigen does not arise by alternative
splicing (exon skipping) of the product of the RHCE gene.

Valenzuela et al. (1991) reported a strong association between plasma
total iron binding capacity (TIBC) and Cc Rh specificity in a Chilean
primary school population in Santiago. Valenzuela et al. (1995) found
similar results in university students from Medellin, Colombia.

In a 3-generation family ascertained through the East of Scotland Blood
Transfusion Service in Dundee, Scotland, Huang et al. (1996) found that
a cataract-causing mutation was cosegregating with an autosomal dominant
anomaly of Rh type known as the Evans phenotype. The geography and the
genetic linkage suggested that the form of cataract may be the same as
that in the Danish family. The red cell Evans phenotype is produced by a
hybrid RH gene in which exons 2-6 from the RHD gene is transferred to
the RHCE gene. Kemp et al. (1996) also examined 5 unrelated Rh D--
homozygotes and found that, in 4 of them, RHCE sequences had been
replaced by RHD sequences. The 5-prime end of these rearrangements
occurred within a 4.2-kb interval around exon 2. There was, however,
heterogeneity at the 3-prime end of the rearranged genes, indicating
that they were not identical by descent, but rather that independent
recombination events had occurred within a small genomic interval--a
recombination hotspot.

Fisher and Race (1946) proposed a model for the evolution of the RH
polymorphism in which the less common haplotypes (CDE, Cde, cdE, and
CdE) are generated and maintained by recombination from those found at
higher frequency. The frequency ratios of the supposed parental and
recombinant haplotypes suggested that the arrangement D-C-E was most
likely under the crossing-over hypothesis. At the time, they assumed
that the 3 series of antigens were encoded in 3 separate genes; the work
outlined earlier indicated that there are 2. Thus recombination between
the sites encoding C/c and E/e would be intragenic, and occur between
exons that are separated by approximately 30 kb (Cherif-Zahar et al.,
1994). Carritt et al. (1997) presented direct evidence for nonreciprocal
intergenic exchange (gene conversion) occurring once in human history to
generate the common RHCE allele, Ce. They also used new polymorphisms to
construct haplotypes which suggested that intragenic recombination
played a major role in the generation of the less common haplotypes, but
only if RHD lies 3-prime of RHCE, i.e., the order is C-E-D. They
provided both genetic and physical evidence supporting this arrangement.

The high degree of homology between the coding regions of the RHCE and
RHD genes is consistent with an ancestral gene duplication. Carritt et
al. (1997) concluded that the human lineage started with the haplotype
cDe. This is consistent with its very high incidence in black Africans
and their descendants (0.4 to 0.5, compared to less than 0.1 elsewhere).
The common haplotype underlying the RhD- phenotype (cde) almost
certainly represented a loss of RHD from cDe. This haplotype is entirely
absent from some aboriginal groups, e.g., Australian, Eskimo, and
Navajo. How the RhD- haplotype became established in a predominantly
RhD+ population, given the moderate to strong selection against RHD+/-
heterozygotes imposed by fetomaternal incompatibility, was still
unknown. As first pointed out in 1942 by Haldane (1942) and reexamined
by Hogben (1943), Li (1953), and others, selection against heterozygotes
results in unstable population equilibria. In an extended simulation
study, Feldman et al. (1969) concluded that, while reproductive
compensation on the part of RhD- mothers can, in principle, lead to
stable equilibria in the face of such selection, other forces, for
example, heterozygote advantage, must operate to maintain RhD+:RhD-
ratios at their observed levels.

Suto et al. (2000) analyzed the organization of the RH genes by 2-color
fluorescence in situ hybridization on DNA fibers released from
lymphocytes (fiber-FISH) and by using DNA probes of introns 3 and 7 of
the RHCE and RHD genes. Six Rh-positive samples (2 with the D+C-c+E+e-,
2 with the D+C+c-E-e+, and 2 with the D+C+c+E+e+ phenotype) showed the
presence of 2 RH genes within a region of less than 200 kb. Of great
interest was the finding that the genes were arranged in antidromic
order starting from the telomere: tel--RHCE (5-prime to 3-prime)--RHD
(3-prime to 5-prime)--centromere. On the other hand, 2 typical
Rh-negative samples (D-C-c+E+e+) showed the presence of only 1 RHCE
gene, as expected.

Wagner and Flegel (2000) showed that the RH locus represents a gene
cluster: RHD (111680) and RHCE face each other by their 3-prime tail
ends, and a third gene, SMP1 (605348), is interspersed between the 2
rhesus genes. The RHD gene deletion was parsimoniously explained by an
unequal crossing-over event. The inverse orientation of the RH genes may
facilitate gene conversion among both rhesus genes, which would explain
the high frequency of hybrid alleles.

The duplication of the rhesus gene occurred during primate evolution
(Matassi et al., 1999), giving rise to the RHD and RHCE genes in humans.
Thus nonprimate mammals, such as mice, may reveal the ancient state of
the RH locus. With this in mind, Wagner and Flegel (2002) analyzed the
sequence of the region. Based on the gene positions and orientations,
RHCE was determined to represent the ancestral state. The close
proximity of SMP1 and RH known in humans was also observed in the mouse
RH locus. Wagner and Flegel (2002) concluded that RHD arose by
duplication of RHCE. The orientation of RHD was probably inverted during
this event. The so-called rhesus boxes, two 9,000-bp DNA segments of
identical orientation flanking the RHD gene, may have been instrumental
for the duplication.

Avent and Reid (2000) provided a comprehensive review of the Rh blood
group system.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
RH E/e POLYMORPHISM
RHCE, PRO226ALA

Mouro et al. (1993) showed that the difference between the classic
allelic antithetical E and e antigens depends on a point mutation in
exon 5 which changes proline to alanine at residue 226 in the e allele.

.0002
RH C/c POLYMORPHISM
RHCE, CYS16TRP, ILE60LEU, SER68ASN, AND SER103PRO

Mouro et al. (1993) showed that the difference between the classic
allelic antithetical C and c antigens depends on point mutations leading
to 4 amino acid substitutions in exons 1 and 2 in the c allele.

.0003
RH-NULL DISEASE, AMORPH TYPE
RHCE, 2-BP DEL, 966T AND 968A

As noted earlier, RH-null disease (which includes the amorphic and
regulator (268150) types) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by
stomatocytosis and chronic hemolytic anemia. Huang et al. (1998) studied
a German family transmitting a putative amorph Rh-null disease gene.
They analyzed the genomic and transcript structure of Rh30, Rh50
(180297), and CD47 (601028), the 3 loci thought to be most critical for
expression of the Rh complex in the red blood cell membrane. They showed
that in this family the Rh50 and CD47 transcripts were normal in primary
sequence. However, the Rh30 locus contained an unusual double mutation
in exon 7 of the RHCE gene, in addition to a deletion of the RhD gene.
The mutation targeted 2 adjacent codons in multiple arrangements,
probably via the mechanism of microgene conversion. One scheme entailed
a noncontiguous deletion of 2 nucleotides, ATT(ile322) to AT and
CAC(his323) to CC, whereas the other involved a T-to-C transition,
ATT(ile322) to ATC, and a dinucleotide deletion, CAC(his323) to C. They
caused the same shift in open reading frame predicted to encode a short
protein with 398 amino acids. The loss of 2 transmembrane domains and
gain of a new C-terminal sequence probably altered the protein
conformation and impaired the Rh complex assembly. The findings
established the molecular identity of an amorph Rh-null disease gene,
showing that Rh30 and Rh50 are both essential for the functioning of the
Rh structures as a multisubunit complex in the plasma membrane.

604725	TITLE *604725 UBIQUITIN-SPECIFIC PROTEASE 2; USP2
;;UBIQUITIN-SPECIFIC PROTEASE, 41-KD; UBP41
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Ubiquitin (191339), a highly conserved protein involved in the
regulation of intracellular protein breakdown, cell cycle regulation,
and stress response, is released from degraded proteins by disassembly
of the polyubiquitin chains. The disassembly process is mediated by
ubiquitin-specific proteases (USPs). Also see USP1 (603478).

CLONING

Using a double-screening method of bacteria expressing chick skeletal
muscle cDNA, Baek et al. (1997) isolated a cDNA encoding a deduced
357-amino acid protein expressing deubiquitinating activity. Because
SDS-PAGE analysis indicated a 41-kD purified protein, the authors termed
the protein Ubp41.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the USP2
gene to chromosome 11 (TMAP SHGC-132662).

182530	TITLE *182530 SON OF SEVENLESS, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG 1; SOS1
;;SOS1 GUANINE NUCLEOTIDE EXCHANGE FACTOR
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

RAS genes (e.g., 190020) encode membrane-bound guanine
nucleotide-binding proteins that function in the transduction of signals
that control cell growth and differentiation. Binding of GTP activates
RAS proteins, and subsequent hydrolysis of the bound GTP to GDP and
phosphate inactivates signaling by these proteins. GTP binding can be
catalyzed by guanine nucleotide exchange factors for RAS, and GTP
hydrolysis can be accelerated by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). The
first exchange factor to be identified for RAS was the S. cerevisiae
CDC25 gene product. Genetic analysis indicated that CDC25 is essential
for activation of RAS proteins. In Drosophila, the protein encoded by
the 'son of sevenless' gene (Sos) contains a domain that shows sequence
similarity with the catalytic domain of CDC25. Sos may act as a positive
regulator of RAS by promoting guanine nucleotide exchange.

CLONING

Bowtell et al. (1992) isolated 2 cDNAs, designated Sos1 and Sos2
(601247), from a mouse eye library by screening with a probe from the
Drosophila Sos gene. Sos1 encodes a predicted 1,336-amino acid protein
which is 67% identical to the partial Sos2 sequence. Both Sos1 and Sos2
have an overall amino acid identity of 45% with the Drosophila Sos gene
product. Northern blots showed that both genes are expressed in a wide
variety of tissues and cell lines.

Chardin et al. (1993) isolated a human cDNA that encodes a widely
expressed 1,333-amino acid protein that is closely related to the
product of the Drosophila Sos gene and nearly identical to the mouse
Sos1 gene product. A fragment of the human gene encoding the
CDC25-related domain complemented loss of CDC25 function in yeast. The
same domain of the human gene specifically stimulated guanine nucleotide
exchange on mammalian RAS proteins in vitro. This and other evidence
indicated to Chardin et al. (1993) that SOS1 is a guanine nucleotide
exchange factor for RAS in the human. Further studies suggested that the
coupling of receptor tyrosine kinases to RAS signaling is mediated by a
molecular complex consisting of growth factor receptor-bound protein-2
(108355) and SOS1.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hart et al. (2002) determined that the SOS1 gene spans 136 kb and
consists of 24 exons. Intronic sizes range from 30 bp to 53 kb. The
translation initiation codon is located at nucleotides 45 to 47 of exon
2, and the open reading frame is terminated at nucleotide 492 in exon
24.

MAPPING

Webb et al. (1993) mapped the mouse Sos1 gene to chromosome 17E by
interspecific backcross analysis and in situ hybridization. They mapped
the human SOS1 gene to chromosome 2p22-p21 by in situ hybridization.

GENE FUNCTION

Scita et al. (1999) showed that EPS8 (600206), E3B1 (603050), and SOS1
form a tricomplex in vivo that exhibits RAC (see 602048)-specific
guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity in vitro.

Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR; 131550) is required for skin
development and is implicated in epithelial tumor formation. Sibilia et
al. (2000) found that transgenic mice expressing SOS-F (a dominant form
of SOS1 lacking the C-terminal region containing the GRB2-binding site
and instead carrying the c-Ha-ras farnesylation site, which provides
constitutive activity) driven by the keratin-5 (K5, or KRT5; 148040)
promoter in basal keratinocytes developed skin papillomas with 100%
penetrance. Tumor formation was inhibited, however, in mice with a
hypomorphic (waved-2, or wa2, mice) and null Egfr background. Similarly,
Egfr-deficient fibroblasts were resistant to transformation by SOS-F and
rasV12, although tumorigenicity could be restored by expression of the
antiapoptotic Bcl2 gene (151430). The K5-SOS-F papillomas and primary
keratinocytes from wa2 mice displayed increased apoptosis and reduced
Akt (164730) phosphorylation, and grafting experiments implied a
cell-autonomous requirement for Egfr in keratinocytes. The authors
concluded that EGFR provides an essential survival signal for
SOS-dependent skin tumor development.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Proteins containing Dbl homology (DH) domains, such as SOS1, activate
Rho family GTPases by functioning as specific guanine nucleotide
exchange factors. All known DH domains have associated C-terminal
pleckstrin homology (PH) domains that are implicated in targeting and
regulatory functions. Soisson et al. (1998) determined the crystal
structure of a fragment of the human SOS1 protein containing the DH and
PH domains at 2.3 angstrom resolution. The entirely alpha-helical DH
domain was unrelated in architecture to other nucleotide exchange
factors. The active site of the DH domain, identified on the basis of
sequence conservation and structural features, lies near the interface
between the DH and PH domains. The structure suggested to the authors
that ligation of the PH domain will be coupled structurally to the
GTPase-binding site.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Gingival Fibromatosis 1

One autosomal dominant form of hereditary gingival fibromatosis (GINGF1;
135300) was mapped to 2p21. To identify the gene responsible for this
disorder, Hart et al. (2002) extended genetic linkage studies to refine
the candidate interval; 16 genes were identified. Sequencing of these
genes identified a mutation (182530.0001) in the SOS1 gene in affected
individuals of 1 family. A transgenic mouse construct with a comparable
SOS1 mutation was found to produce a phenotype with skin hypertrophy
(Sibilia et al., 2000).

- Noonan Syndrome

Noonan syndrome (163950) is a developmental disorder characterized by
short stature, facial dysmorphism, congenital heart defects, and
skeletal anomalies. Gain-of-function mutations in PTPN11 (176876), which
encodes the tyrosine phosphatase SHP2, cause approximately 50% of Noonan
syndrome cases. Mutations in KRAS (190070) cause less than 5% of Noonan
syndrome cases. Both SHP2 and KRAS participate in signaling through the
RAS GTPase. Roberts et al. (2007) and Tartaglia et al. (2007) identified
mutations in SOS1, which encodes an essential RAS guanine nucleotide
exchange factor (GEF), in Noonan syndrome patients. Among patients with
Noonan syndrome without mutation in PTPN11 or KRAS, Roberts et al.
(2007) found missense SOS1 mutations in approximately 20%; Tartaglia et
al. (2007), in 22 of 129 such individuals.

Noonan syndrome shares some phenotypic features with
cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome (CFCS; 115150). Furthermore, both are due
to heterozygous gain-of-function mutations in genes encoding proteins of
the Ras-MAPK signaling cascade. Zenker et al. (2007) investigated SOS1
in a large cohort of patients with disorders of the NS-CFCS spectrum,
who had previously tested negative for mutations in PTPN11, KRAS, BRAF
(164757), MEK1 (176872), and MEK2 (601263). Missense mutations of SOS1
were discovered in 28% of patients with Noonan syndrome, thus confirming
SOS1 as the second major gene for that disorder. In contrast, none of
the patients classified as having CFCS carried a pathogenic sequence
change in the SOS1 gene. Patients with NS and mutations in SOS1 (NS4;
610733) have a distinctive phenotype with frequent ectodermal anomalies
such as keratosis pilaris and curly hair. Findings corroborated that,
despite being caused by gain-of-function mutations in molecules
belonging to the same pathway, NS and CFCS scarcely overlap
genotypically.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
FIBROMATOSIS, GINGIVAL, 1
SOS1, 1-BP INS

In an extensive Brazilian family with hereditary gingival fibromatosis
(135300), Hart et al. (2002) demonstrated that the disorder was caused
by insertion of a cytosine between nucleotides 126142 and 126143 in
codon 1083 of the SOS1 gene. The insertion mutation introduced a
frameshift and created a premature stop codon, abolishing 4 functionally
important proline-rich SH3 binding domains normally present in the
carboxyl-terminal region of the SOS1 protein. In the cDNA sequence, the
insertion was between nucleotides 3248 and 3249. The mutation yielded a
chimeric 1,105-amino acid protein that consisted of 1,083 SOS1
N-terminal amino acids in a normal sequence, followed by 22 replaced
amino acids and a premature stop codon at codon 1106.

.0002
NOONAN SYNDROME 4
SOS1, THR266LYS

In a 6-year-old girl with sporadic Noonan syndrome (NS4; 610733),
Roberts et al. (2007) found a 797C-A transversion in exon 6 of the SOS1
gene that resulted in a thr266-to-lys substitution (T266K). The child
had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with thrombocytopenia and easy bruising.

Ferrero et al. (2008) reported a newborn with Noonan syndrome and the
T266K mutation. The pregnancy was characterized by polyhydramnios and
increased fetal nuchal translucency. Dysmorphic facial features included
hypertelorism, epicanthal folds, flat nasal bridge, low-set posteriorly
rotated ears, and short neck. Other features included moderate pulmonic
stenosis and bilateral cryptorchidism. Developmental milestones were
normal at 24 months of age. There were no coagulation abnormalities.
Ferrero et al. (2008) noted the phenotypic differences from the patient
reported by Roberts et al. (2007).

.0003
NOONAN SYNDROME 4
SOS1, MET269ARG

In 2 patients with sporadic Noonan syndrome (NS4; 610733), Roberts et
al. (2007) detected an 806T-G transversion in the SOS1 gene that caused
a met269-to-arg (M269R) substitution. One of the patients was a
7-year-old boy with pulmonic stenosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,
easy bruising, and cryptorchidism with inguinal hernia. The other was an
11-year-old boy with pulmonic stenosis and atrial septal defect and
cryptorchidism. School placement was regular in both cases. Tartaglia et
al. (2007) identified the same mutation in 1 patient, also a sporadic
case.

.0004
NOONAN SYNDROME 4
SOS1, ARG552GLY

In a 41-year-old father and his infant son, Roberts et al. (2007) found
that Noonan syndrome (NS4; 610733) was associated with a missense
mutation in the SOS1 gene: an arg552-to-gly substitution (R552G) caused
by a 1654A-G transition. The son had pulmonic stenosis. The father had
cryptorchidism. Both showed 25 to 50% normal linear growth. Tartaglia et
al. (2007) identified this mutation in 2 de novo cases.

.0005
NOONAN SYNDROME 4
SOS1, ARG552SER

In a girl with Noonan syndrome-4 (NS4; 610733) who had pigmented
villonodular synovitis (PVNS), Mascheroni et al. (2008) identified a de
novo heterozygous mutation in the SOS1 gene, resulting in an
arg552-to-ser (R522S) substitution. She presented at 13 years with
swelling and severe pain in her right foot and ankle. History and
physical examination showed that she had multiple features of Noonan
syndrome. Mascheroni et al. (2008) suggested that PVNS is a
proliferative lesion that is part of the phenotypic spectrum of Noonan
syndrome. Another mutation in this same codon (R552G; 182530.0004) has
also been reported.

.0006
NOONAN SYNDROME 4
SOS1, TRP432ARG

In 2 brothers, born of consanguineous parents, with Noonan syndrome-4
(NS4; 610733) and multiple giant cell lesions, Hanna et al. (2009)
identified a heterozygous 1294T-C transition in exon 10 of the SOS1
gene, resulting in a trp432-to-arg (W432R) substitution within the
pleckstrin homology domain. One boy presented at age 4.5 years with a
2-year history of bilateral progressive swelling of the mandible.
Radiographic studies showed multilocular lesions of the mandibular rami,
consistent with giant cell lesions. The boy's 6.5-year-old brother
presented with severe pulmonary valvular stenosis and was found to have
similar multilocular lesions of the mandible as his brother. Both boys
had characteristic facial features of Noonan syndrome, including high
anterior hairline with frontal bossing, follicular hyperkeratosis of the
forehead (keratosis pilaris), depressed nasal bridge, hypertelorism,
downslanting palpebral fissures, and low-set and posteriorly angulated
ears with thick helices. Other features included short neck and widely
spaced nipples. Both showed normal development and normal stature. The
father showed milder features of the disorder, with long face,
downslanting palpebral fissures, low-set ears, and widely spaced
nipples, and was also heterozygous for the W432R mutation.

176977	TITLE *176977 PROTEIN KINASE C, DELTA; PRKCD
;;PKCD
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The genes encoding the protein kinase C enzymes are widely distributed,
e.g., PRKCA (176960) on chromosome 17, PRKCB1 (176970) on 16, and PRKCG
(176980) on 19. Although the sequence homology among the PRKC family of
genes is extensive, the pattern of expression varies among tissues. For
example, the delta polypeptide appears to be the major isoform expressed
in mouse hematopoietic cells. Mischak et al. (1991) isolated and
characterized the mouse Prkcd gene.

Aris et al. (1993) obtained 2 PKC-delta clones from a HepG2 human liver
cell cDNA library. The clones differed at 3 nucleotides, resulting in
nonconservative changes at positions 375 (phe to ser) and 593 (val to
met) in the deduced 676-amino acid protein. Human PKC-delta shares about
90% amino acid identity with mouse and rat Pkc-delta. Western blot
analysis detected a 76-kD protein following expression of either
PKC-delta clone in insect cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Aris et al. (1993) found that PKC-delta underwent calcium-independent
autophosphorylation in the presence of phosphatidylserine and
diacylglycerol. Diacylglycerol was an absolute requirement for PKC-delta
activation. This and other cofactor and substrate requirements
distinguished human PKC-delta from its mouse homolog.

Liu et al. (2006) showed that preexisting nuclear RELA (164014), which
is an NFKB subunit, positively regulates ultraviolet (UV)
irradiation-induced activation of JNK (MAPK8; 601158). In UV-irradiated
mouse fibroblasts, they found that Pkc-delta was required for Rela to
activate Jnk, thereby contributing to UV-induced apoptosis.

Tu et al. (2007) showed that Wnt3a (606359) signaling induced
osteoblastogenesis in a mouse stromal bone marrow cell line, ST2,
through G-alpha-q (GNAQ; 600998) and G-alpha-11 (GNA11; 139313), leading
to activated phosphatidylinositol signaling and Prkcd. Wnt7b (601967),
expressed by osteogenic cells in vivo, induced osteoblast
differentiation in ST2 and mouse mesenchymal cells via the
Prkcd-mediated pathway. Tu et al. (2007) concluded that PRKCD is part of
a noncanonical WNT signaling cascade.

In a cultured bovine retinal pericyte model, Geraldes et al. (2009)
demonstrated that hyperglycemia persistently activates PRKCD and
p38-alpha MAPK (MAPK14; 600289), thus increasing expression of SHP1
(PTPN6; 176883), and that this occurs independently of NFKB (see 164011)
activation. This signaling cascade leads to PDGF receptor-beta (PDGFRB;
173410) dephosphorylation and a reduction in downstream signaling from
this receptor, resulting in pericyte apoptosis, the most specific
vascular histopathology associated with diabetic complications. The
authors observed increased PRKCD activity and an increase in the number
of acellular capillaries in diabetic mouse retinas, which were not
reversible with insulin treatment that achieved normoglycemia. Unlike
diabetic age-matched wildtype mice, diabetic Prkcd -/- mice did not show
activation of MAPK14 or SHP1, inhibition of PDGFB (190040) signaling in
vascular cells, or the presence of acellular capillaries. The authors
also observed PRKCD, MAPK14, and SHP1 activation in brain pericytes and
in the renal cortex of diabetic mice. Geraldes et al. (2009) concluded
that this represents a new signaling pathway by which hyperglycemia can
induce PDGFB resistance and increased vascular cell apoptosis to cause
diabetic vascular complications.

Haubensak et al. (2010) used molecular genetic approaches to map the
functional connectivity of a subpopulation of GABA-containing neurons
located in the lateral subdivision of the central amygdala (CEl), which
express PRKCD. Channelrhodopsin-2-assisted circuit mapping in amygdala
slices and cell-specific viral tracing indicated that PRKCD-positive
neurons inhibit output neurons in the medial central amygdala (CEm), and
also make reciprocal inhibitory synapses with PRKCD-negative neurons in
CEl. Electrical silencing of PRKCD-positive neurons in vivo suggested
that they correspond to physiologically identified units that are
inhibited by the conditioned stimulus, called CEl(off) units. Haubensak
et al. (2010) concluded that this correspondence, together with
behavioral data, defines an inhibitory microcircuit in CEl that gates
CEm output to control the level of conditioned freezing.

Ciocchi et al. (2010) used in vivo electrophysiologic, optogenetic, and
pharmacologic approaches in mice to demonstrate that neuronal activity
in the CEl is required for fear acquisition, whereas conditioned fear
responses are driven by output neurons in the CEm. Functional circuit
analysis revealed that inhibitory CEA microcircuits are highly organized
and that cell type-specific plasticity of phasic and tonic activity in
the CEl to CEm pathway may gate fear expression and regulate fear
generalization.

Burguillos et al. (2011) showed that the orderly activation of caspase-8
(601763) and caspase-3/7 (601761), known executioners of apoptotic cell
death, regulate microglia activation through a PRKCD-dependent pathway.
Burguillos et al. (2011) found that stimulation of microglia with
various inflammogens activates caspase-8 and caspase-3/7 in microglia
without triggering cell death in vitro and in vivo. Knockdown or
chemical inhibition of each of these caspases hindered microglia
activation and consequently, reduced neurotoxicity. The authors observed
that these caspases are activated in microglia in the ventral
mesencephalon of Parkinson disease (168600) and the frontal cortex of
individuals with Alzheimer disease (104300). Burguillos et al. (2011)
concluded that caspase-8 and caspase-3/7 are involved in regulating
microglia activation, and suggested that inhibition of these caspases
could be neuroprotective by targeting the microglia rather than the
neurons themselves.

Qu et al. (2012) showed that PRKCD phosphorylates NLRC4 (606831) and
that this phosphorylation is critical for inflammasome assembly. Using
knockin mice expressing NLRC4 with a carboxy-terminal 3XFlag tag, Qu et
al. (2012) identified phosphorylation of NLRC4 on a single,
evolutionarily conserved residue, ser533, following infection of
macrophages with Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. Western
blotting with an NLRC4 phospho-ser533 antibody confirmed that this
posttranslational modification occurs only in the presence of stimuli
known to engage NLRC4 and not the related protein NLRP3 (606416) or AIM2
(604578). Nlrc4-null macrophages reconstituted with NLRC4 mutant S533A,
unlike those reconstituted with wildtype NLRC4, did not activate
caspase-1 (147678) and pyroptosis in response to S. typhimurium,
indicating that S533 phosphorylation is critical for NLRC4 inflammasome
function. Conversely, phosphomimetic NLRC4 S533D caused rapid macrophage
pyroptosis without infection. Biochemical purification of the
NLRC4-phosphorylating activity and a screen of kinase inhibitors
identified PRKCD as a candidate NLRC4 kinase. Recombinant PRKCD
phosphorylated NLRC4 S533 in vitro, immunodepletion of PRKCD from
macrophage lysates blocked NLRC4 S533 phosphorylation in vitro, and
Prkcd-null macrophages exhibited greatly attenuated caspase-1 activation
and IL1-beta (147720) secretion specifically in response to S.
typhimurium. Phosphorylation-defective NLRC4 S533A failed to recruit
procaspase-1 and did not assemble inflammasome specks during S.
typhimurium infection, so phosphorylation of NLRC4 S533 probably drives
conformational changes necessary for NLRC4 inflammasome activity and
host innate immunity.

MAPPING

By study of a panel of somatic cell human/hamster hybrid DNAs, Huppi et
al. (1994) mapped the PRKCD gene to human chromosome 3. By analysis of
recombination frequency in an interspecific panel of backcross mice,
they mapped the murine homolog to chromosome 14 in a region syntenic
with human 3p.

ANIMAL MODEL

PRKCD is involved in B cell signaling and in the regulation of growth,
apoptosis, and differentiation of a variety of cell types. Prkcd is most
abundant in B and T lymphocytes of lymphoid organs, cerebrum, and
intestine of normal mice. By generating mice with a disruption in the
Prkcd gene, Miyamoto et al. (2002) observed that the mice are viable up
to 1 year but prone to autoimmune disease, with enlarged lymph nodes and
spleens containing numerous germinal centers. Flow cytometric analysis
showed increased numbers of bone marrow-derived B cells, but no change
in CD5+ B cells or T cells. Transfer of B cells into Rag1 (179615) -/-
mice resulted in greater numbers of splenic B cells and germinal centers
in mice receiving Prkcd -/- cells. Prkcd-deficient B cells also mounted
a stronger proliferative response than those from wildtype mice. RT-PCR
analysis detected higher levels of IL6 (147620), but not other
cytokines, in mutant than in wildtype B cells. EMSA analysis showed
increased DNA-binding activity of NFIL6 (CEBPB; 189965) but not NFKB.
Serum IgG1 and IgA, but not other isotype, concentrations were greater
in Prkcd-deficient mice. Although Miyamoto et al. (2002) did not detect
antinuclear antibodies, they did observe high levels of primarily IgG
antibodies to chromatin in older mutant mice. Histologic analysis
revealed evidence of glomerulonephritis with deposition of IgG and
complement component C3. Miyamoto et al. (2002) noted that crosslinking
of B cell receptors leads to activation of both Prkcb (176970) and
Prkcd, but that proliferation in mice deficient in these enzymes is
reduced and enhanced, respectively, possibly allowing for fine
regulation of the immune response.

Mecklenbrauker et al. (2002) generated mice with a null mutation in
Prkcd. They found that this deficiency prevents B cell tolerance and
allows maturation and terminal differentiation of self-reactive B cells
in the presence of a tolerizing antigen, soluble hen egg lysozyme. The
authors detected high levels of serum anti-DNA antibodies as well as
polyreactive antibodies to antigens without previous immunization. They
concluded that although Prkcd deficiency does not affect B cell
receptor-mediated activation in response to immunogens, induction of
tolerance is compromised in the mutant mice.

Using a mouse model, Mecklenbrauker et al. (2004) reported a mechanism
for the regulation of peripheral B-cell survival by serine/threonine
protein kinase C-delta: spontaneous death of resting B cells is
regulated by nuclear localization of Pkcd that contributes to
phosphorylation of histone H2B (see 609904) at serine-14. Treatment of B
cells with the potent B-cell survival factor Baff (603969) prevented
nuclear accumulation of Pkcd. Mecklenbrauker et al. (2004) concluded
that their data suggested the existence of a previously unknown
BAFF-induced and PKCD-mediated nuclear signaling pathway which regulates
B-cell survival.

Tu et al. (2007) found that Prkcd -/- mouse embryos showed much less
ossification and delayed chondrocyte maturation in long bones compared
to control embryos. The level of phospho-Marcks (177061) was lower in
the cytosol of Prkcd -/- limb primordial cells than in control cells at
embryonic day 14.5, suggesting MARCKS may be an endogenous PRKCD
substrate.

Schwegmann et al. (2007) used microarray and quantitative RT-PCR
analyses of Listeria monocytogenes (LM)-infected macrophages from Nfil6
-/- mice to identify candidate genes downstream of Nfil6 in pathways of
LM killing independent of reactive nitrogen and oxygen intermediates.
They found increased expression of Pkcd in LM-infected Nfil6 -/-
macrophages compared with wildtype controls. Compared with LM-infected
wildtype mice, LM-infected Pkcd -/- mice exhibited higher mortality
accompanied by higher LM burden and increased inflammation with hepatic
microabscesses, despite enhanced levels of Nfil6 and Il6. Pkcd -/-
macrophages showed no impairment in activation, but they had high
bacterial load and increased bacterial escape from phagosomes.
Schwegmann et al. (2007) concluded that PKCD is a critical factor for
confinement and killing of LM within macrophage phagosomes.

605846	TITLE *605846 B-CELL CLL/LYMPHOMA 7B; BCL7B
DESCRIPTION Meng et al. (1998) constructed a physical map encompassing the 1.5-Mb
region of chromosome 7q11.23 that is commonly deleted in Williams-Beuren
syndrome (WBS; 194050). They identified 3 genes within this region,
including BCL7B, which contains 6 exons. By EST database searching,
screening of a liver cDNA library, and sequencing, they cloned a BCL7B
cDNA encoding a deduced 202-amino acid protein that shows high homology
to the BCL7A gene (601406), which was cloned from a complex chromosomal
translocation in Burkitt lymphoma cell lines. BCL7B is highly conserved
from C. elegans to human, suggesting that it has been conserved through
evolution.

Jadayel et al. (1998) also cloned the BCL7B gene as well as the BCL7C
(605847) gene. They determined that both encode proteins sharing 90%
identity with the N-terminal 51 amino acids of BCL7A and suggested that
the 3 genes are members of an evolutionarily conserved gene family.

612041	TITLE *612041 RING FINGER PROTEIN 212; RNF212
;;ZHP3, C. ELEGANS, HOMOLOG OF; ZHP3;;
ZIP3-RELATED PROTEIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Jantsch et al. (2004) identified the human ring finger protein RNF212 as
an expressed sequence tag, Q86W82. It has considerable sequence homology
to the Caenorhabditis elegans protein Zhp3, which was shown by Jantsch
et al. (2004) to play a role in meiotic recombination.

Reynolds et al. (2013) cloned full-length mouse Rnf212. The deduced
307-amino acid protein has an N-terminal ring finger domain, followed by
a coiled-coil domain and a C-terminal serine-rich domain. The ring
finger domain is characteristic of E3 ligase enzymes that catalyze
protein modification by ubiquitin (see 191339)-like molecules. The human
RNF212 protein shares significant identity with the full-length mouse
protein and has a similar domain structure. Reynolds et al. (2013) also
identified 2 splice variants of mouse Rnf212 that encode C-terminally
truncated proteins of 133 and 52 amino acids. Immunohistochemical
analysis of mouse spermatocyte and oocyte nuclei revealed dynamic
localization of Rnf212 to synaptonemal complexes, including
pseudoautosomal regions of X-Y chromosomes. Rnf212 localized more weakly
to DNA double-strand break sites.

MAPPING

Kong et al. (2008) identified the RNF212 gene within a linkage
disequilibrium block on chromosome 4p16.3 associated with recombination
rate.

GENE FUNCTION

Using mutant mouse spermatocytes, Reynolds et al. (2013) found that
mouse Rnf212 localized to synaptonemal complexes due to high binding
affinity for the synaptonemal complex central element. Absence of the
central element caused defective localization of Rnf212.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Kong et al. (2008) found 2 SNPs within the RNF212 gene, dbSNP rs3796619
(612041.0001) and dbSNP rs1670533 (612041.0002), that are associated
with inverse recombination rates in males and females. Haplotype CT was
associated with high male recombination rate and low female
recombination; the opposite was true for haplotype TC. A phylogenetic
analysis of a 55-kb region containing the SNPs dbSNP rs3796619 and dbSNP
1670533 in the HapMap data revealed 3 well-differentiated clusters of
haplotypes showing notable differences in frequency between the Yoruban
Nigerians and CEU and East Asians. The CT and TC haplotypes that
associated most strongly with recombination rate had a combined
frequency of only 17% in the Yoruban sample, but reached a frequency of
91% and 98% in the CEU and East Asian samples, respectively. Several
SNPs in this region showed an unusual degree of divergence among the
HapMap groups, on the basis of rank percentile of their F(ST) values
(the Wright coefficient, a measure of variance in allele frequencies
among populations) among all autosomal SNPs with the same overall
frequency in the HapMap.

ANIMAL MODEL

Jantsch et al. (2004) showed that Zhp3 knockout worms showed normal
homolog pairing and synaptonemal complex formation. The timing of
appearance and the nuclear localization of the recombination protein
Rad51 (179617) seemed normal in these animals, suggesting proper
initiation of meiotic recombination by DNA double-strand breaks.
However, the occurrence of univalents during diplotene indicated that C.
elegans Zhp3 protein is essential for reciprocal recombination between
homologous chromosomes and thus chiasma formation. In the absence of
Zhp3, reciprocal recombination was abolished and double-strand breaks
seemed to be repaired via alternative pathways, leading to achiasmatic
chromosomes and the occurrence of univalents during meiosis I.

Reynolds et al. (2013) found that both male and female Rnf212 -/- mice
appeared normal but were sterile. Male Rnf212 -/- mice showed reduced
testis size and absence of post-anaphase I cells. Rnf212 -/- ovaries
were similar in size to those of wildtype animals, and high numbers of
oocytes were present in mature animals. Both Rnf212 -/- spermatocyte and
oocyte nuclei showed apparently normal pachytene nuclei and fully
synapsed autosomes. However, X-Y synapsis was destabilized and crossover
complexes were absent in Rnf212 -/- spermatocytes. Reynolds et al.
(2013) found that Rnf212 was required to stabilize the meiosis-specific
factors Msh4 (602105) and Tex11 (300311).

RNF212, IVS, C/T

In a genomewide scan for variants associated with recombination rate
(612042), Kong et al. (2008) identified a SNP in the RNF212 gene, dbSNP
rs3796619, that was strongly associated. The SNP dbSNP rs3796619 was
strongly associated with male recombination rate (P = 3.2 x 10(-24)),
and each copy of allele T (compared with C) was estimated to decrease
recombination rate by 70.7 cM. This and another associated SNP in
RNF212, dbSNP rs1670533 (612041.0002), are in strong linkage
disequilibrium; for males, haplotype CT was associated with
significantly higher recombination rate than both TT and TC (P = 3.2 x
10(-7) and 7.0 x 10(-23), respectively). For females, haplotype TC was
associated with significantly higher recombination rate than both
haplotypes TT (P = 6.6 x 10(-7)) and CT (P = 5.4 x 10(-11)), although
there was not a significant difference between the latter 2 haplotypes.

and, relative to the TT homozygote, each copy of allele C was estimated
to increase recombination rate by 88.2 cM. See also 612041.0001.

610514	TITLE *610514 PHD FINGER PROTEIN 17; PHF17
;;GENE FOR APOPTOSIS AND DIFFERENTIATION IN EPITHELIA; JADE1;;
KIAA1807
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2001) cloned PHF17, which they designated
KIAA1807. The deduced 702-amino acid protein shares significant
similarity with the human zinc finger protein BR140 (BRPF1; 602410).
RT-PCR ELISA detected very high expression in whole adult brain and
intermediate expression in all other tissues examined, including all
specific brain regions tested.

Using VHL (608537) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of an adult human
kidney cDNA library, Zhou et al. (2002) cloned PHF17, which they called
JADE1. The deduced 509-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular
mass of 58.4 kD. It has a PEST domain near its N-terminal end, 2 central
plant homeodomains (PHDs), and candidate sites for N-glycosylation,
myristoylation, and serine or threonine phosphorylation. Northern blot
analysis detected transcripts of 6.0 and 3.6 kb with high expression in
kidney, followed by moderate expression in pancreas and skeletal muscle,
and low expression in all other examined tissues. Western blot analysis
detected human and mouse Jade1 at 64 and 61 kD, respectively, with high
expression in mouse and human kidney, moderate expression in human
pancreas, liver, and heart and in mouse liver, and no expression in
human brain. Western blot analysis of mouse kidney cortex and cultured
cells revealed prominent expression in proximal tubule cells. Endogenous
JADE1 localized to prominent nuclear speckles and diffuse cytoplasmic
speckles in human renal cancer cells.

By database and genomic sequence analyses, Tzouanacou et al. (2003)
identified several splice variants of mouse and human JADE1 that encode
at least 2 protein isoforms, JADE1L and JADE1S. JADE1L likely
corresponds to the 6.0-kb transcript reported by Zhou et al. (2002). The
deduced 842-amino acid JADE1L protein has an N-terminal PEST motif,
followed by 2 PHD zinc finger domains, a bipartite nuclear localization
signal, and a C-terminal PEST motif. JADE1S corresponds to the JADE1
transcript cloned by Zhou et al. (2002). The deduced 510-amino acid
JADE1S protein lacks the nuclear localization signal and C-terminal PEST
motif of JADE1L. Jade1 was expressed in mouse primitive streak and tail
bud and in other embryonic regions containing pluripotent or
tissue-specific progenitor cells including early gastrulation epiblast
and the ventricular zone of the cerebral cortex. Jade1 was also
expressed in developing musculature and extraembryonic tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid and immunoprecipitation analysis of endogenous and
cotransfected proteins, Zhou et al. (2002) showed that VHL bound avidly
and selectively to JADE1. Analysis of the binding between truncated
proteins showed that the N terminus and the inter-PHD region of JADE1
were important for interaction with VHL. VHL increased the abundance of
JADE1, primarily by prolonging JADE1 protein half-life.

Using reporter gene constructs, Panchenko et al. (2004) showed that
JADE1 could activate transcription and that deletion of the PHD zinc
fingers abolished transcriptional activity. JADE1 also promoted histone
H4 (see 602822), but not histone H3 (see 602810) acetylation in a
dose-dependent manner, and acetylation required the PHDs. A JADE1 mutant
lacking the second PHD behaved in a dominant-negative manner. TIP60
(HTATIP; 601409), a histone acetyltransferase with histone H4/H2A
specificity, physically associated with JADE1 and augmented JADE1
acetyltransferase function.

Zhou et al. (2005) found that expression of JADE1 was very low in all
human renal carcinoma cell lines tested and was independent of VHL
expression. Inhibition of proteasome activity increased JADE1 protein
expression. JADE1 inhibited renal cancer cell growth, colony formation,
and tumor formation in nude mice, and reduced the branching of renal
cell growth in 3-dimensional cultures. JADE1 increased apoptosis and
decreased levels of antiapoptotic BCL2 (151430), and antisense JADE1
increased cell growth rates. Zhou et al. (2005) concluded that JADE1 is
a proapoptotic barrier to proliferation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Tzouanacou et al. (2003) determined that the mouse Phf17 gene contains
13 exons, including 3 alternative noncoding first exons. They stated
that the human PHF17 gene has a similar structure.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the PHF17
gene to chromosome 4 (TMAP SHGC-67603).

ANIMAL MODEL

Tzouanacou et al. (2003) found that Jade1-null mouse embryos were viable
and fertile and showed no obvious abnormalities compared to their
wildtype or heterozygote littermates. However, Jade1-null animals were
obtained at less than the expected mendelian ratio at weaning age.

608426	TITLE *608426 MAKORIN 2; MKRN2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the makorin family, including MKRN2, have a characteristic
zinc finger composition that suggests that they are ribonucleoproteins
(Gray et al., 2001).

CLONING

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to MKRN1 (607754),
followed by PCR and 5-prime RACE of a heart muscle cDNA library, Gray et
al. (2001) cloned MKRN2. The deduced 416-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 47.0 kD. MKRN2 contains 3 N-terminal C3H
zinc fingers, a central typical makorin cys-his motif, a RING zinc
finger motif, and a C-terminal C3H zinc finger. Gray et al. (2001)
identified 2 MKRN2 transcripts that differ only in the use of alternate
polyadenylation signals. The longer transcript, which they designated
MKRN2-FAR, extends 101 nucleotides into the 3-prime UTR of the
oppositely oriented RAF1 gene (164760) and includes the complement of
the tandem RAF1 polyadenylation signals. The shorter transcript,
designated MKRN2-NEAR, has no region of overlap with RAF1. Northern blot
analysis detected MKRN2-FAR in all normal tissues and most tumor cell
lines examined. MKRN2-NEAR was detected in all samples tested except
colon and peripheral blood leukocytes. Gray et al. (2001) also cloned
mouse Mkrn2, which encodes a 416-amino acid protein with a calculated
molecular mass of 46.5 kD. There is only 1 mouse transcript, which
corresponds to the human MKRN1-FAR polyadenylation form. In their
RAF1-overlapping sequences, mouse and human MKRN1 share 70% nucleotide
identity, whereas the remainder of the 3-prime UTRs share only 37%
nucleotide identity. The common MKRN2/RAF1 mRNA sequences also have
several AUUUA motifs typical of unstable mRNAs. Gray et al. (2001)
presented evidence that MKRN2 arose from MKRN1 gene duplication early in
vertebrate evolution.

GENE STRUCTURE

Gray et al. (2001) determined that the MKRN2 gene contains 8 exons and
spans 27 kb. It has an atypical exon/intron splice donor junction, which
is common in intron-containing MKRN genes, at the boundary of exon 2 and
intron 2. The mouse Mkrn2 gene shows a similar structure, but it spans
only about 16 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Gray et al. (2001) mapped the MKRN2 gene
to chromosome 3p25. The extreme 3-prime UTR of the MKRN2 gene overlaps
the extreme 3-prime UTR of the oppositely oriented RAF1 gene. Gray et
al. (2001) mapped the mouse Mkrn2 gene to chromosome 6, where it
overlaps the Raf1 gene at the extreme 3-prime end.
