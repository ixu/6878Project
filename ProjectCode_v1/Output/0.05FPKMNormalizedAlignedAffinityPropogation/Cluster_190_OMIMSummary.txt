;;SKELETROPHIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using differential display to identify genes upregulated by truncated
SWI1 (ARID1A; 603024) in a neuroblastoma cell line, followed by
screening a brain cDNA library, Takeuchi et al. (2003) cloned MIB2,
which they called skeletrophin. The deduced 1,013-amino acid protein
contains a dystrophin (DMD; 300377)-like cysteine-rich zinc-binding
domain in its N-terminal half and 5 ankyrin (see 600465) repeats in its
C-terminal half. Northern blot analysis detected a 3.2-kb transcript
that was highly expressed in skeletal muscle and more weakly expressed
in brain, heart, and kidney. Western blot analysis detected a 70-kD
protein in skeletal muscle, heart, and brain, but not in liver, thymus,
or lung. Immunohistochemical analysis of skeletal muscle detected
cytoplasmic foci of skeletrophin expression near the cell surface.

Takeuchi et al. (2005) stated that skeletrophin contains 2 C-terminal
RING-HC domains, the second of which is atypical. By database analysis,
they identified 6 skeletrophin splice variants. RT-PCR analysis showed
tissue-specific expression of 3 of the variants. Dot blot analysis using
a cDNA encoding the N-terminal half of skeletrophin as probe revealed
widespread expression, with highest levels in skeletal muscle.

Koo et al. (2005) identified mouse and human MIB2 as paralogs of
zebrafish Mib (MIB1; 608677). MIB2 has a HERC2 (605837)/Mib domain on
each side of the zinc finger domain, as well as a Mib repeat prior to
the ankyrin repeats. Mouse tissues expressed 2 major Mib2 variants, and
overall expression was higher in neonates and adults than in embryos.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid and coimmunoprecipitation analyses, Takeuchi et al.
(2003) showed that skeletrophin interacted with alpha-actin (ACTA1;
102610). Skeletrophin was expressed in 23 of 25 benign nevi, but not in
18 of 38 cases of primary skin melanoma. Treatment with a demethylating
agent restored skeletrophin expression in a human melanoma cell line.

Takeuchi et al. (2005) showed that a recombinant protein containing only
the RING domains of skeletrophin promoted autoubiquitination in a UBCH5B
(UBE2D2; 602962)-dependent manner. Mutation of cys969 in the second RING
motif eliminated the activity, whereas mutation of cys891 in the first
RING motif had no effect. Protein pull-down assays showed that
full-length skeletrophin bound Jagged-2 (JAG2; 602570), but it did not
bind other Notch (see NOTCH1; 190198) ligands tested. Skeletrophin
ubiquitinated the intracellular domain of JAG2, and immunohistochemical
analysis indicated that skeletrophin expression altered the
intracellular localization of JAG2. Overexpression of skeletrophin in a
mouse myeloma cell line induced expression of the Notch effector Hes1
(139605) in cocultured mouse stromal cells by direct cell-cell contact.
RING finger-mutated skeletrophin did not enhance Hes1 expression.
Takeuchi et al. (2005) found elevated skeletrophin expression in 23 of
40 multiple myeloma specimens, especially from patients with osteolytic
bone lesions.

Koo et al. (2005) showed that the RING domains of mouse Mib2 had E3
ubiquitin ligase activity. Mutation of the second RING domain, but not
the first, reduced the activity. Full-length Mib2 underwent
autoubiquitination in transfected cells, an effect that was dramatically
increased in the presence of a proteasome inhibitor. Mib2 interacted
with Xenopus Delta (XD; see 606582) in transfected cells, and mutation
analysis showed that the intracellular domain of XD interacted with the
N-terminal region of Mib2. In transfected HeLa cells, mouse Mib2
colocalized with an early endosomal marker, and coexpression of Mib2
with XD caused ubiquitination of XD and relocalization of XD from the
cell surface into cytoplasmic vesicular structures. Mib2 rescued both
the neuronal and vascular defects in the zebrafish Mib mutant,
confirming that Mib2 acts along the Notch signaling pathway.

Takeuchi et al. (2006) found aberrant methylation of the skeletrophin
promoter in 6 of 31 invasive melanomas, but in none of 25 benign nevi or
5 noninvasive superficial spreading melanomas. The zinc finger
transcription factor SNAIL (see SNAI1; 604238), which is overexpressed
in many melanoma cells, repressed the skeletrophin promoter via an E
box-related element and was involved in downregulation of skeletrophin.
AP2 (TFAP2A; 107580) increased skeletrophin expression. Exogenous
expression of skeletrophin reduced melanoma cell invasion in vitro and
in vivo, and colony formation in soft agar was reduced in a RING
motif-dependent manner, without affecting cell growth. Skeletrophin
downregulated transcription of MET (164860) and increased expression of
HES1.

GENE STRUCTURE

Takeuchi et al. (2005) determined that the MIB2 gene contains 18 exons
and spans 14 kb.

Takeuchi et al. (2006) found that the MIB2 promoter region is GC rich
and lacks typical TATA and CAAT boxes.

MAPPING

Using FISH, Takeuchi et al. (2003) mapped the MIB2 gene to chromosome
1p36.3-p36.2. Takeuchi et al. (2005) mapped the MIB2 gene to chromosome
1p36.32 by genomic sequence analysis.

611354	TITLE *611354 CLEAVAGE AND POLYADENYLATION-SPECIFIC FACTOR 3-LIKE; CPSF3L
;;INTEGRATOR COMPLEX SUBUNIT 11; INTS11;;
RELATED TO CPSF SUBUNITS, 68-KD PROTEIN; RC68
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The Integrator complex contains at least 12 subunits and associates with
the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II large subunit (POLR2A;
180660) and mediates the 3-prime end processing of small nuclear RNAs U1
(RNU1; 180680) and U2 (RNU2; 180690). INTS11, or CPSF3L, is the
catalytic subunit of the Integrator complex (Baillat et al., 2005).

CLONING

By searching for members of the beta-lactamase superfamily (see LACTB,
608440), Dominski et al. (2005) identified CPSF3L, which they called
RC68. The deduced 600-amino acid protein contains an N-terminal
histidine motif involved in zinc binding and catalysis, suggesting that
RC68 functions as an RNA-specific endonuclease. Fluorescence- and
epitope-tagged RC68 was expressed in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of
transfected HeLa cells, with higher concentrations in the nucleus. The
expression of RC68 did not change during the cell cycle.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis of HeLa cells, Dominski et al. (2005) showed
that full-length RC74 (INTS9; 611352) interacted with C-terminal
fragments of RC68 and full-length importin-alpha (KNPA2; 600685). Using
reciprocal immunoprecipitations, they confirmed the interaction between
RC74 and the C-terminal region of RC68 in HeLa cells and mouse myeloma
cells. Depletion of RC68 in HeLa cells by small interfering RNA led to
cell cycle arrest at G1. Arrested cells were the size of G2 cells,
indicating that depletion of RC68 blocked entry into S phase but did not
prevent cell growth.

Using immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis to identify proteins
that interact with DSS1 (601285), Baillat et al. (2005) identified
several Integrator complex proteins, including INTS11.
Immunoprecipitation analysis of HEK293 cells expressing epitope-tagged
INTS11 revealed the presence of RNA polymerase II (see POLR2A; 180660)
and other Integrator subunits. Expression of a mutant INTS11 protein
(E203Q) in HEK293 cells resulted in an Integrator complex that could
associate with both the promoter and the 3-prime end of U1 and U2 small
nuclear RNA, but could not process U1 and U2 primary transcripts.

MAPPING

Hartz (2007) mapped the CPSF3L gene to chromosome 1p36.33 based on an
alignment of the CPSF3L sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK000549) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.1).

;;ABH7
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database analysis to identify sequences similar to ABH genes (see
ALKBH1; 605345), followed by PCR of a testis cDNA library, Tsujikawa et
al. (2007) cloned ALKBH7, which they called ABH7. The deduced 221-amino
acid protein has a C-terminal AlkB homology domain that is predicted to
function as a 2-oxoglutarate- and Fe(II)-dependent oxygenase domain.
Quantitative real-time PCR detected variable ABH7 expression in all 16
tissues examined, with highest expression in pancreas, followed by
spleen, prostate, ovary, and placenta. Fluorescence-tagged ABH7 was
expressed in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of transfected HeLa cells.

MAPPING

Hartz (2010) mapped the ALKBH7 gene to chromosome 19p13.3 based on an
alignment of the ALKBH7 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC004393) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

610712	TITLE *610712 TESTIS-SPECIFIC SERINE/THREONINE KINASE 6; TSSK6
;;SMALL SERINE/THREONINE PROTEIN KINASE; SSTK;;
TSSK4
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TSSK6 is a serine/threonine protein kinase that is required for
postmeiotic chromatin remodeling and male fertility (Spiridonov et al.,
2005).

CLONING

By searching databases using a protein kinase catalytic domain as query,
Spiridonov et al. (2005) identified TSSK6, which they called SSTK. EST
analysis suggested the existence of 3 TSSK6 splice variants that use 2
different polyadenylation sites. The deduced 273-amino acid TSSK6
protein has a calculated molecular mass of 30.3 kD and consists almost
entirely of the N and C lobes of a protein kinase domain. TSSK6
possesses several essential protein kinase features, including a
conserved active site, ATP-binding region, and potential activation loop
phosphorylation motif. Northern blot analysis detected high expression
of a 1.5-kb transcript in adult testis, with lower expression in colon,
small intestine, ovary, prostate, thymus, spleen, and peripheral blood
leukocytes. A 3-kb transcript was expressed in spinal cord and medulla
oblongata. RT-PCR analysis confirmed that highest TSSK6 expression was
in testis.

GENE FUNCTION

Using wildtype TSSK6 and TSSK6 mutants expressed and immunopurified from
293T cells for in vitro protein kinase assays, Spiridonov et al. (2005)
found that TSSK6 had protein kinase activity against myelin basic
protein (MBP; 159430), as well as autophosphorylation activity. Lys41
and asp135 of TSSK6 were essential for MBP phosphorylation. TSSK6
phosphorylation of MBP occurred almost entirely on serines, and further
studies using synthetic peptides showed that TSSK6 displayed highest
phosphorylation activity on peptides containing a common RxxSxxR
sequence. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis of TSSK6 expressed in 293T
cells showed that TSSK6 bound heat-shock proteins HSP90-1-beta (HSPCB;
140572), HSC70 (HSPA8; 600816), and HSP70-1 (HSPA1A; 140550). In vitro
phosphorylation studies showed that TSSK6 phosphorylated histones H1
(see 142711), H2A (see 613499), H2AX (H2AFX; 601772), and H3 (see
602810), but not H2B (see 602803), H4 (see 602822), or TP1 (TNP1;
190231).

GENE STRUCTURE

Spiridonov et al. (2005) determined that the TSSK6 gene contains 2
exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Spiridonov et al. (2005) mapped the TSSK6
gene to chromosome 19. They mapped the mouse Tssk6 gene to chromosome 8.
Hao et al. (2004) reported that the TSSK6 gene, which they called TSSK4,
maps to chromosome 19p13.11, and that the mouse Tssk6 gene maps to
chromosome 8B3.3.

ANIMAL MODEL

Spiridonov et al. (2005) found that Tssk6-null female mice were fertile,
but Tssk6-null males were sterile and had reduced sperm counts,
decreased sperm motility, and a dramatic increase in the percentage of
sperm with abnormal morphology. Beginning at stage 10, Tssk6-null
elongating spermatids displayed abnormal sperm head development
characterized by increased space between the nuclear envelope and
condensing nucleus of the posterior head. Stage-12 Tssk6-null elongating
spermatids showed expansion of the perinuclear and subacrosomal space
and accumulation of electron dense matter between the membranes of the
head and nucleus. Spiridonov et al. (2005) concluded that Tssk6-null
spermatozoa have impaired DNA condensation.

189902	TITLE *189902 TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR DP1; TFDP1
;;E2F DIMERIZATION PARTNER 1; DP1;;
TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR, SEQUENCE-SPECIFIC, DRTF1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The E2F transcription factor family (see 189971) regulates the
expression of various cellular promoters, particularly those involved in
the cell cycle. E2F factors bind to DNA as homodimers or heterodimers in
association with dimerization partner DP1. TFDP1 may be the first
example of a family of related transcription factors; see TFDP2
(602160).

CLONING

The cDNA for transcription factor DP1 (TFDP1) was cloned by Girling et
al. (1993) from a library of F9 embryonal carcinoma cells by using PCR
primers predicted from partial peptide sequences of a 46-kD protein. The
protein was isolated by virtue of its binding to a DNA sequence taken
from the adenovirus E2A promoter. TFDP1 is a component of the DRTF1/E2F
transcription factor complex, which coordinates events in the cell cycle
by interacting with RB1 (614041), the retinoblastoma gene product, and
RB-related proteins (Bandara and La Thangue, 1991). DRTF1 activity is
downregulated in differentiating embryonal carcinoma cells, and E2F
activity is induced in adenovirus-infected HeLa cells. Bandara and La
Thangue (1991) showed that the adenovirus E1a protein causes the
dissociation of the RB protein from this complex. TFDP1 has a predicted
sequence of 410 amino acids (Girling et al., 1993) with a region of
similarity to E2F1 (189971), accounting for the ability of both to bind
the same DNA sequence.

GENE FUNCTION

SMAD3 (603109) is a direct mediator of transcriptional activation by the
TGF-beta (190180) receptor (see 190181). Its target genes in epithelial
cells include cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK; see 116953) inhibitors that
generate a cytostatic response. Chen et al. (2002) defined how, in the
same context, SMAD3 can mediate transcriptional repression of the
growth-promoting gene MYC (190080). A complex containing SMAD3, the
transcription factors E2F4 (600659), E2F5 (600967), and DP1, and the
corepressor p107 (116957) preexists in the cytoplasm. In response to
TGF-beta, this complex moves into the nucleus and associates with SMAD4
(600993), recognizing a composite SMAD-E2F site on MYC for repression.
Previously known as the ultimate recipients of CDK regulatory signals,
E2F4/E2F5 and p107 act here as transducers of TGF-beta receptor signals
upstream of CDK. SMAD proteins therefore mediate transcriptional
activation or repression depending on their associated partners.

Gain-of-function mutations in LRRK2 (609007) cause Parkinson disease
(PARK8; 607060) characterized by age-dependent degeneration of
dopaminergic neurons. Gehrke et al. (2010) found that LRRK2 interacted
with the microRNA (miRNA) pathway to regulate protein synthesis. They
showed that mRNAs for Drosophila E2f1 and Dp, which had previously been
implicated in cell cycle and survival control (Girling et al., 1993),
were translationally repressed by the miRNAs Let7 (MIRLET7A1; 605386)
and miR184* (613146), respectively. Pathogenic human LRRK2 antagonized
Let7 and miR184*, leading to overproduction of E2f1 and Dp, which was
critical for LRRK2 pathogenesis. In Drosophila, genetic deletion of
Let7, antagomir-mediated blockage of Let7 and miR184* action, transgenic
expression of Dp target protector, or replacement of endogenous Dp with
a Dp transgene nonresponsive to Let7 each had toxic effects similar to
those of pathogenic LRRK2. Conversely, increasing the level of Let7 or
miR184* attenuated pathogenic LRRK2 effects. Human LRRK2 associated with
Drosophila Argonaute-1 (EIF2C1, or AGO1; 606228) or human Argonaute-2
(EIF2C2, or AGO2; 606229) of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC).
In aged fly brain, Ago1 protein level was negatively regulated by human
LRRK2. Furthermore, pathogenic LRRK2 promoted the association of
phosphorylated 4EBP1 (EIF4EPB1; 602223) with human AGO2. Gehrke et al.
(2010) concluded that deregulated synthesis of E2F1 and DP caused by
miRNA pathway impairment is a key event in LRRK2 pathogenesis,
suggesting that novel miRNA-based therapeutic strategies may be useful
for Parkinson disease.

MAPPING

In a study mapping the human SOX1 gene (602148) to 13q34 by fluorescence
in situ hybridization, Malas et al. (1997) demonstrated that the TFDP1
gene maps distal to SOX1 on 13q34. Zhang et al. (1997) used fluorescence
in situ hybridization to map the TFDP1 gene to human chromosome 13q34.
They noted the presence of a pseudogene, termed TFDP1P, at 1q32.3.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Abba et al. (2007) observed genomic amplification affecting the murine
chromosome 8 region in mouse mammary tumors. The homologous syntenic
cluster mapping to human chromosome 13q34 was also amplified in a subset
of human breast cancers. Specifically, the TFDP1 gene showed the highest
frequency of amplification affecting 23 (31.1%) of 74 primary breast
cancer samples. Other genes within the same cluster region on 13q34 were
also amplified, including CUL4A (603137), LAMP1 (153330), and GAS6
(600441). Metaanalysis of publicly available gene expression data showed
a strong association between high expression of TFDP1 and decreased
overall survival in patients with breast cancer.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the ephrin family are ligands for EPH-related receptor
tyrosine kinases and are attached to the cell membrane by either a
glycosylphosphatidylinositol linkage or a single transmembrane domain.
See 179610 for additional information on ephrins and the Eph receptor
family.

CLONING

Tang et al. (1997) isolated a cDNA encoding ephrin-B3 (EFNB3), named
LERK8 by them, by screening a human fetal brain cDNA library using mouse
Efnb1 cDNA as a probe. The EFNB3 protein contains a predicted
transmembrane region, and its 340-amino acid sequence shares 38% and 40%
identity with those of the transmembrane ephrins EFNB1 (300035) and
EFNB2 (600527), respectively. Since the N-terminal halves of EFNB1,
EFNB2, and EFNB3 are especially conserved, Tang et al. (1997) suggested
that these proteins bind the same subclass of EPH-related receptor
tyrosine kinases. In addition, a C-terminal region containing 5
conserved tyrosine residues is strikingly similar among these ephrins,
and the authors speculated that this region may function in signal
transduction. Using Northern blot analysis, Tang et al. (1997) found
that the EFNB3 gene is expressed as a major 3.5-kb transcript. In the
midterm fetus, the highest EFNB3 mRNA level is in brain, followed by
heart, kidney, and lung; expression in the adult is restricted to brain
and is particularly high in forebrain subregions. Tang et al. (1997)
suggested that EFNB3 is important in both brain development and
maintenance and that it may play a pivotal role in forebrain function.

GENE FUNCTION

Palmer et al. (2002) showed that SRC family kinases, or SFKs (see SRC;
190090), are positive regulators of ephrin-B phosphorylation and
phosphotyrosine-mediated reverse signaling. EphB receptor engagement of
ephrin-B caused rapid recruitment of SFKs to ephrin-B expression domains
and transient SFK activation. With delayed kinetics, ephrin-B ligands
recruited the cytoplasmic PDZ domain-containing protein tyrosine
phosphatase PTPBL (see 600267) and were dephosphorylated. These data
suggested the presence of a switch mechanism that allows a shift from
phosphotyrosine-/SFK-dependent signaling to PDZ-dependent signaling.

Local circuits in the spinal cord that generate locomotion are termed
central pattern generators. These provide coordinated bilateral control
over the normal limb alternation that underlies walking. Isolated spinal
cords from mice lacking either the EphA4 receptor (602188) or its ligand
ephrin B3 have lost left-right limb alternation and instead exhibit
synchrony. Kullander et al. (2003) identified EphA4-positive neurons as
an excitatory component of the locomotor central pattern generator.
Kullander et al. (2003) concluded that dramatic locomotor changes can
occur as a consequence of local genetic rewiring and identified genes
required for the development of normal locomotor behavior.

In mouse hippocampal neurons, Grunwald et al. (2004) showed that ephrin
B2 and B3 are predominantly located postsynaptically and are required
for synaptic plasticity, including both long-term potentiation and
long-term depression. The EphA4 receptor is also critically involved in
long-term plasticity independent of its cytoplasmic domain, suggesting
that the ephrin B proteins are the active signaling partner. Grunwald et
al. (2004) suggested that ephrins can be used in converse manners,
depending on the synaptic site.

MAPPING

Tang et al. (1997) mapped the EFNB3 gene to chromosome 17 by PCR
screening of somatic cell hybrid DNAs. They refined the localization to
17p13.1-p11.2 by PCR screening of a chromosome 17 regional mapping
panel.

190370	TITLE *190370 TRICHOHYALIN; TCHH
;;THH;;
THL;;
TRHY
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Trichohyalin confers mechanical strength to the hair follicle inner root
sheath and to other toughened epithelial tissues, such as the hard
palate and filiform ridges of the tongue, by forming multiple complex
crosslinks with itself and with other structural proteins (Steinert et
al., 2003).

CLONING

Rothnagel and Rogers (1986) isolated trichohyalin protein from sheep
wool follicles. Western blot analysis detected trichohyalin in rat
vibrissae inner root sheaths and in guinea pig and human hair follicles.
Western blot analysis showed that the human protein had an apparent
molecular mass of 220 kD. In rat vibrissae, trichohyalin localized to
granular structures, but not to newly synthesized filaments.

Fietz et al. (1990) obtained a partial cDNA encoding the C-terminal
region of sheep wool follicle trichohyalin. The predicted protein
sequence consists of full and partial repeats of a 23-amino acid
sequence that could form an alpha-helical rod, followed by a C-terminal
domain. In situ hybridization of sheep wool follicles showed that
trichohyalin was expressed in both the inner root sheath and medulla
cells.

Using immunofluorescence microscopy, O'Keefe et al. (1993) found that
trichohyalin was a major component of tongue filiform papillae in humans
and several other mammalian species. It was also expressed in the
ventral matrix of human nail, with weaker staining of the nail plate,
but no staining of the nail bed. Trichohyalin partially colocalized with
filaggrin (FLG; 135940) in human tongue epithelium. Cells of the stratum
corneum in human scalp epidermis contained a proteolytically processed
form of trichohyalin that lacked the C-terminal domain.

Lee et al. (1993) cloned human TCHH, which they called TRHY. The deduced
1,898-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 248 kD. TRHY
has a high number of charged residues, as well as many glutamines. It
was predicted to consist of 9 distinct domains, with a net overall
length of 215 nm. Domain 1 includes 2 putative calcium-binding EF-hand
motifs, and the C-terminal globular domain (domain 9) terminates in 20
residues that are precisely conserved between humans and sheep. Several
other domains have repeats that were predicted to form alpha-helical rod
structures. TRHY has 3 potential phosphorylation sites. Northern blot
analysis of human foreskin epidermis detected a 6.7-kb TRHY transcript.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lee et al. (1993) determined that the TCHH gene contains 3 exons. Exon 2
contains the initiation codon, and the upstream region contains
potential TATA and CAT boxes.

MAPPING

Using a sheep trichohyalin cDNA probe in tritium-labeled in situ
hybridization, Fietz et al. (1992) mapped the human TCHH gene to
chromosome region 1q21.1-q23, probably 1q21.3. Profilaggrin, involucrin,
and loricrin (LOR; 152445) map to the same area, suggesting that the 4
proteins form a novel superfamily of epithelial structural proteins.

By analysis of human-rodent somatic cell hybrids and fluorescence in
situ hybridization, Lee et al. (1993) confirmed the mapping of TCHH to
chromosome 1q21.

GENE FUNCTION

Lee et al. (1993) showed that pig tongue Trhy bound radiolabeled calcium
in vitro as efficiently as calmodulin (CALM1; 114180).

Steinert et al. (2003) stated that trichohyalin is sequentially
subjected to postsynthetic modifications by peptidylarginine deiminases
(see 607934), which convert many of its arginines to citrullines, and by
transglutaminases (see 190195), which introduce intra- and interprotein
chain crosslinks. They characterized the proteins to which trichohyalin
became crosslinked in the inner root sheath of mouse hair follicles.
Trichohyalin initially served as an interfilamentous matrix protein by
becoming crosslinked to itself and to the head and tail domains of the
inner root sheath keratin (see 608245) intermediate filament chains. It
then served as a cross-bridging reinforcement protein of the cornified
cell envelope of the inner root sheath cells by becoming crosslinked to
several barrier proteins, such as involucrin (IVL; 147360). Finally,
trichohyalin provided mechanical strength in the mature structure by
stabilizing the linkages between keratin filaments and the cell
envelope.

601738	TITLE *601738 EXOSTOSIN-LIKE GLYCOSYLTRANSFERASE 1; EXTL1
;;EXOSTOSIN-LIKE 1;;
MULTIPLE EXOSTOSES-LIKE 1;;
EXTL
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The tumor suppressor genes EXT1 (608177) and EXT2 (608210) are
associated with hereditary multiple exostoses and encode bifunctional
glycosyltransferases essential for chain polymerization of heparan
sulfate and its analog, heparin. Wise et al. (1997) identified another
gene, which they called EXTL, that showed striking sequence similarity
to both EXT1 and EXT2 at the nucleotide and amino acid sequence levels.
Although the mRNA transcribed from this gene is similar in size to that
of EXT1 and EXT2, its pattern of expression was quite different.

GENE FUNCTION

Of the 3 highly homologous EXT-like genes, EXTL1, EXTL2 (602411), and
EXTL3 (605744), EXTL2 is an alpha-1,4-GlcNAc transferase I, the key
enzyme that initiates the heparan sulfate/heparin synthesis. Kim et al.
(2001) transiently expressed truncated forms of EXTL1 and EXTL3, lacking
the putative NH2-terminal transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, in
COS-1 cells and found that the cells harbored alpha-GlcNAc transferase
activity. Various results suggested that EXTL3 is most likely involved
in both chain initiation and elongation, whereas EXTL1 is possibly
involved only in the chain elongation of heparan sulfate, and perhaps of
heparin as well. Thus, the acceptor specificities of the 5 family
members are overlapping but distinct, except for EXT1 and EXT2, which
have the same specificity. Thus, all of the 5 cloned human EXT gene
family proteins harbor glycosyltransferase activities, which probably
contribute to the synthesis of heparan sulfate and heparin.

Hall et al. (2002) proposed the EXTL genes as candidates for second
mutations leading to the development of exostoses.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Exclusion Studies

Xu et al. (1999) examined the EXTL1 and EXTL2 genes for the presence of
germline mutations in hereditary multiple exostosis patients and found
none.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization,
Wise et al. (1997) mapped EXTL to 1p36.1 between D1S458 and D1S511, a
region that frequently shows loss of heterozygosity in a variety of
tumor types.

600662	TITLE *600662 MADS BOX TRANSCRIPTION ENHANCER FACTOR 2, POLYPEPTIDE C; MEF2C
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MEF2C belongs to the myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF2) family of
transcription factors. MEF2C plays a pivotal role in myogenesis,
development of the anterior heart field, neural crest and craniofacial
development, and neurogenesis, among others (summary by Zweier et al.,
2010).

See also MEF2A (600660).

CLONING

McDermott et al. (1993) cloned a member of the MEF2 family of proteins
from a human skeletal muscle cDNA library using a fragment of the MEF2A
cDNA as a probe. Transcripts of MEF2C were found in the skeletal muscle
and brain. Alternative splice variants were found, 1 of which was unique
to the brain.

Leifer et al. (1993) found that the brain form was expressed by neurons
in particular layers of the cerebral cortex and that expression declined
during postnatal development. The skeletal isoform of the cDNA encodes a
465-amino acid protein with conserved MADS and MEF2 domains. Like the
other MEF2 gene products, MEF2C has both DNA binding and
trans-activating activities indistinguishable from other members of the
family. MEF2C, however, is induced late during myogenic differentiation
and has a strict tissue-specific pattern of expression not seen in MEF2A
or MEF2B.

Zweier et al. (2010) found high expression of isoform 1 of the MEF2C
gene in fetal and adult human brain, whereas isoform 2 was widely
expressed with highest levels in skeletal muscle.

GENE FUNCTION

Breitbart et al. (1993) suggested that, while MEF2A may be involved in
induction of muscle differentiation, MEF2C may be involved with
maintenance of the differentiated state.

CREB-binding protein (CBP; 600140)/p300 (602700) and p300/CBP-associated
factor (PCAF; 602203) are coactivators for MEF2C during differentiation.
Chen et al. (2000) showed that NCOA2 mediates the coactivation of
MEF2C-dependent transcription through interaction with the MADS box
domain of MEF2C. They proposed a model of cooperative interaction
between NCOA2, myogenin (MYOG; 159980), and MEF2C in the regulation of
muscle-specific gene expression.

During mammalian development, electrical activity promotes the
calcium-dependent survival of neurons that have made appropriate
synaptic connections. Mao et al. (1999) showed that calcium influx into
cerebellar neurons triggers the activation of the MKK6 (601254)-p38 MAP
kinase (600289) cascade and that the p38 MAP kinase then phosphorylates
and activates MEF2s. Once activated by this calcium-dependent p38 MAP
kinase signaling pathway, MEF2 can regulate the expression of genes that
are critical for survival of newly differentiated neurons. These
findings demonstrated that MEF2 is a calcium-regulated transcription
factor and defined a function for MEF2 during nervous system development
that is distinct from previously well-characterized functions of MEF2
during muscle differentiation.

Chen et al. (2002) demonstrated that Carm1 (603934) and Ncoa2
cooperatively stimulated the activity of Mef2c in mouse mesenchymal stem
cells and found that there was direct interaction among Mef2c, Grip1,
and Carm1.

By targeting human MEF2A or mouse Mef2c expression to mouse
cardiomyocytes, Xu et al. (2006) demonstrated that overexpressing these
transcription factors caused cardiomyopathy or predisposed transgenic
mice to more fulminant disease following pressure overload. In cultured
cardiomyocytes, MEF2A or Mef2c overexpression induced sarcomeric
disorganization and focal elongation. Both MEF2A and Mef2c programmed
similar profiles of gene expression in the heart that included genes
involved in extracellular matrix remodeling, ion handling, and
metabolism.

Potthoff et al. (2007) showed that class II histone deacetylases (e.g.,
HDAC5; 605315) were selectively degraded by the proteasome in mouse
slow, oxidative myofibers, enabling Mef2 to activate the slow myofiber
gene program. Forced expression of Hdac5 in skeletal muscle or genetic
deletion of Mef2c or Mef2d (600663) blocked activity-dependent fast to
slow fiber transformation, whereas expression of hyperactive Mef2c
promoted the slow fiber phenotype, enhancing endurance and enabling mice
to run almost twice the distance of wildtype littermates.

Using a loss-of-function allele in mice, Johnnidis et al. (2008)
reported that the myeloid-specific microRNA-223 (miR223; 300694)
negatively regulates progenitor proliferation and granulocyte
differentiation and activation. miR223 mutant mice had an expanded
granulocytic compartment resulting from a cell-autonomous increase in
the number of granulocyte progenitors. Johnnidis et al. (2008) showed
that Mef2c, a transcription factor that promotes myeloid progenitor
proliferation, is a target of miR223, and that genetic ablation of Mef2c
suppresses progenitor expansion and corrects the neutrophilic phenotype
in miR223-null mice. In addition, granulocytes lacking miR223 were
hypermature, hypersensitive to activating stimuli, and displayed
increased fungicidal activity. As a consequence of this neutrophil
hyperactivity, miR223 mutant mice spontaneously developed inflammatory
lung pathology and exhibited exaggerated tissue destruction after
endotoxin challenge. Johnnidis et al. (2008) concluded that their data
supported a model in which miR223 acts as a fine tuner of granulocyte
production and the inflammatory response.

Zweier et al. (2010) demonstrated that MEF2C increases promoter
activation of the MECP2 (300005) and CDKL5 (300203) genes.

MAPPING

Martin et al. (1994) mapped Mef2 to mouse chromosome 13. By fluorescence
in situ hybridization, Krainc et al. (1995) mapped human MEF2C to
chromosome 5q14, a region with homology of synteny to the mouse
location.

CYTOGENETICS

In 5 unrelated children with severe mental retardation, stereotypic
movements, epilepsy, and/or cerebral malformations (613443), Le Meur et
al. (2010) identified 5 different interstitial de novo deletions of
chromosome 5q14 ranging in size from 216 kb to 8.8 Mb. The minimal
common deleted region contained only the MEF2C gene.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a girl with severe mental retardation, stereotypic movements,
epilepsy, and cerebral malformation (MRD20; 613443), Le Meur et al.
(2010) identified a de novo heterozygous nonsense mutation in the MEF2C
gene (S228X; 600662.0001). Le Meur et al. (2010) noted that the role of
MEF2C in synaptic plasticity is consistent with a role in learning and
memory, and the authors referred to the mouse models of Li et al. (2008)
and Barbosa et al. (2008).

Zweier et al. (2010) identified 4 different de novo heterozygous
mutations in the MEF2C gene (see. e.g., 600662.0002-600662.0004) in 4 of
362 probands with mental retardation who were screened for mutations in
this gene. Two of the mutations were missense and 2 were truncating. Two
additional patients with a similar disorder had heterozygous deletions
involving the MEF2C gene. Analysis of blood-derived RNA showed
significantly decreased levels of MEF2C isoform 2 mRNA in all patients
with deletions in or including the MEF2C gene region, including the
patients reported by Engels et al. (2009), Cardoso et al. (2009), and Le
Meur et al. (2010), suggesting haploinsufficiency. Two patients with
missense mutations did not show decreased MEF2C mRNA levels. All
deletions and mutations caused significantly decreased MEF2C
transcriptional activity, which could be rescued by wildtype MEF2C.
Finally, all patients, including the 2 with missense mutations, showed
decreased levels of MECP2 mRNA, and all except 2 patients had decreased
levels of CDKL5 mRNA. These 2 genes are involved in Rett or Rett
syndrome-like phenotypes (312750 and 300672, respectively), which shares
some features with MRD20. Zweier et al. (2010) concluded that the
phenotype results from involvement of a common pathway involving these 3
genes.

ANIMAL MODEL

Members of the MEF2 family of MADs-box transcription factors bind to an
A-T-rich DNA sequence associated with muscle-specific genes. The murine
Mef2c gene is expressed in heart precursor cells before formation of the
linear heart tube. In mice homozygous for a known mutation of Mef2c, Lin
et al. (1997) found that the heart tube did not undergo looping
morphogenesis, the future right ventricle did not form, and a subset of
cardiac muscle genes was not expressed. The absence of the right
ventricular region of the mutant correlated with downregulation of the
dHAND gene, which encodes a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor
required for cardiac morphogenesis. The authors concluded that MEF2C is
an essential regulator of cardiac morphogenesis and right ventricular
development.

Von Both et al. (2004) characterized the molecular basis for defective
heart formation in Foxh1 (603621)-null mice and determined that Mef2c is
a direct target of Foxh1. They identified a composite Foxh1-Nkx2.5
(600584)-binding site within the Mef2c gene that was regulated by
Tgf-beta (see 190180) signaling in a Smad-dependent manner. Von Both et
al. (2004) concluded that a TGF-beta-like SMAD signaling pathway
specifies the anterior heart field through a FOXH1-NKX2.5 complex that
regulates MEF2C expression.

Verzi et al. (2007) found that conditional inactivation of Mef2c in
mouse neural crest resulted in neonatal lethality due to severe
craniofacial defects. Mef2c was required for expression of Dlx5
(600028), Dlx6 (600030), and Hand2 (602407) transcription factors in the
branchial arches, and Verzi et al. (2007) identified a branchial
arch-specific enhancer in the Dlx5/Dlx6 locus that was activated
synergistically by Mef2c and Dlx5. Mef2c and Dlx5/Dlx6 also interacted
genetically, since mice heterozygous for either Dlx5/Dlx6 or Mef2c were
normal at birth and survived to weaning, whereas heterozygosity for both
Dlx5/Dlx6 and Mef2c resulted in defective palate development and
neonatal lethality.

Barbosa et al. (2008) found that mice with brain-specific deletion of
the Mef2c gene were viable to adulthood, were slightly smaller than
wildtype littermates, and showed impaired balance beam walking and an
abnormal hind/forelimb clasping reflex at a young age. In addition,
Mef2c-knockout mice showed impaired hippocampal-dependent learning and
memory. These behavioral changes were accompanied by a marked increase
in the number of excitatory synapses and potentiation of basal and
evoked synaptic transmission resulting from altered presynaptic
function. Conversely, neuronal expression of a superactivating form of
Mef2c in postsynaptic cells resulted in a reduction of excitatory
postsynaptic sites without affecting learning and memory performance. No
changes in synapse structure were observed. The findings suggested that
MEF2C activity per se does not directly determine learning, but somehow
facilitates learning-related plasticity by controlling excessive
synaptic input. Barbosa et al. (2008) concluded that refinement of
synaptic connectivity facilitates hippocampal-dependent learning and
memory.

Li et al. (2008) found that conditional knockout of Mef2c in nestin
(NES; 600915)-expressing neural stem/progenitor cells impaired neuronal
differentiation in mice, resulting in aberrant aggregation and
compaction of neurons migrating into the lower layers of the neocortex
during development. Neural stem cell proliferation and survival were not
affected. Conditional Mef2c-null mice surviving to adulthood manifested
smaller, less mature neurons and smaller brain size with more immature
electrophysiologic network properties. They also showed severe
behavioral deficits reminiscent of Rett syndrome (RTT; 312750), such as
anxiety, decreased cognitive function, and marked paw-clasping. Li et
al. (2008) concluded that MEF2C has a crucial role in programming early
neuronal differentiation and proper distribution within the layers of
the neocortex during development.

MENTAL RETARDATION, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT 20
MEF2C, LEU38GLN

In a 3-year-old girl with MRD20 (613443), Zweier et al. (2010)
identified a de novo heterozygous 113T-A transversion in exon 3 of the
MEF2C gene, resulting in a leu38-to-gln (L38Q) substitution in the MADS
domain. Homology modeling predicted that the mutation may alter
DNA-binding affinity. The patient had severe mental retardation with
absent speech and inability to walk, hypotonia, seizure onset at age 10
months, delayed myelination, and mildly dysmorphic facial features.

MEF2C, 1-BP DUP, 99T

In a 14-year-old boy with MRD20 (613443), Zweier et al. (2010)
identified a de novo heterozygous 1-bp duplication (99dupT) in exon 3 of
the MEF2C gene, resulting in a glu34-to-ter (E34X) substitution. The
patient had severe mental retardation with absent speech, hypertonia,
seizures onset at age 10 months, mildly enlarged ventricles, and mildly
dysmorphic facial features.

MEF2C, GLY27ALA

In a 10-year-old girl with MRD20 (613443), Zweier et al. (2010)
identified a de novo heterozygous 80G-C transversion in exon 3 of the
MEF2C gene, resulting in a gly27-to-ala (G27A) substitution in the MADS
domain. Homology modeling predicted that the mutation may alter
DNA-binding affinity. The patient had severe mental retardation with
absent speech and difficulty walking, hypotonia, seizure onset at 6
months, delayed myelination, and mildly dysmorphic facial features.

MENTAL RETARDATION, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT 20
MEF2C, 1-BP DEL, 457A

In an 8-year-old girl with severe MRD20 (613443), Bienvenu et al. (2013)
identified a de novo heterozygous 1-bp deletion (457delA) in exon 5 of
the MEF2C gene, predicted to result in premature termination
(N153TfsX33) and loss of the functional transactivation domain. In
infancy, the patient had poor feeding due to marked hypotonia and poor
eye contact due to strabismus. Motor milestones were delayed, and she
walked at age 4 years. At age 18 months, she had a single episode of
myoclonic febrile seizures that were easily controlled. At age 7 years,
she had poor growth, microcephaly (-2.5 SD), lack of speech,
stereotypical movements, unstable wide-based gait, and happy demeanor.
There were mild dysmorphic features, including large eyebrows, open
mouth with thick everted lower lip, and anteverted nares. Brain MRI was
normal.

601180	TITLE *601180 RAN-BINDING PROTEIN 1; RANBP1
;;HPAII TINY FRAGMENTS LOCUS 9A; HTF9A
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Coutavas et al. (1993) isolated a Ran/TC4-binding protein, RanBP1, that
interacts specifically with GTP-charged RAN (601179). The authors cloned
the mouse RanBP1 cDNA by screening an expression library containing
cDNAs from 16-day mouse embryos.

Bischoff et al. (1995) identified a 23-kD protein, RANBP1, that binds to
RAN complexed with GTP but not GDP. Based on partial peptide sequence of
the purified protein, primers were designed to amplify a cDNA encoding
the protein. They also showed that RANBP1 does not activate GTPase
activity of RAN but does markedly increase GTP hydrolysis by the
RanGTPase-activating protein (RanGAP1).

Hayashi et al. (1995) isolated human RANBP1 using the 2-hybrid method
with either RAN or RCC1 (179710) as targets. The RANBP1 cDNA encodes a
201-amino acid protein that is 92% identical to its mouse homolog.
Hayashi et al. (1995) showed that, in both mammalian cells and in yeast,
RANBP1 acts as a negative regulator of RCC1 by inhibiting
RCC1-stimulated guanine nucleotide release from RAN. See also 601181.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Seewald et al. (2002) presented the 3-dimensional structure of a
Ran-RanBP1-RanGAP ternary complex in the ground state and in a
transition-state mimic. The structure and biochemical experiments showed
that RanGAP does not act through an arginine finger, that the basic
machinery for fast GTP hydrolysis is provided exclusively by Ran, and
that correct positioning of the catalytic glutamine is essential for
catalysis.

GENE FUNCTION

Guarguaglini et al. (1997) found that mouse Htf9c (611151) and Ranbp1
were divergently transcribed from a bidirectional promoter. Expression
of both genes was activated upon entry into the cell cycle, peaked in S
phase, and was downregulated during completion of the cell cycle. The
bidirectional promoter was downregulated in both orientations in
arrested cells. Activation of the promoter was specific, resulting in
more restricted Htf9c expression and a sharper peak of Htf9c expression
in S phase compared with Ranbp1 expression. A region containing an E2f
(189971) site was important for cell cycle control of Htf9c, and a
common region containing sites for Sp1 (189906) and E2f contributed to
activation in both orientations.

;;DDB1- AND CUL4-ASSOCIATED FACTOR 3; DCAF3;;
KIAA1736
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated hippocampus cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned KIAA1736. RT-PCR ELISA detected
nearly uniform expression in all adult and fetal tissues examined and in
all adult brain regions examined.

Fimia et al. (2007) cloned mouse Ambra1, which encodes a deduced
1,300-amino acid protein with an N-terminal WD40 domain. By database
analysis, they identified and cloned human AMBRA1, which encodes a
deduced 1,269-amino acid protein. Ambra1 was expressed throughout
development in mice, with strong staining in the neuroepithelium.

GENE FUNCTION

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis and coimmunoprecipitation assays, Fimia et
al. (2007) showed that a central region of human AMBRA1 bound BECN1
(604378), a component of the class III phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase
complex (VPS34, or PIK3C3; 602609) that regulates autophagosome
formation. Downregulation of AMBRA1 expression in a human fibrosarcoma
cell line decreased autophagy and the rate of cell proliferation.
Conversely, overexpression of AMBRA1 increased autophagy and the rate of
cell proliferation. AMBRA1 downregulation also significantly reduced the
ability of BECN1 to interact with VPS34.

MAPPING

The Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the AMBRA1 gene to
chromosome 11 (TMAP RH28670).

ANIMAL MODEL

Using a large-scale mutagenesis approach, Fimia et al. (2007) created
mice with a mutation in the Ambra1 gene. Homozygosity of the mutation
was embryonic lethal, with neural tube defects detected as
midbrain/hindbrain exencephaly and/or spina bifida. Defects were
associated with autophagy impairment, accumulation of ubiquitinated
proteins, unbalanced cell proliferation, and excessive apoptotic cell
death. Fimia et al. (2007) concluded that AMBRA1 is an essential element
regulating autophagy, cell growth, and cell death required for neural
development.

179490	TITLE *179490 RAS-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN RAB3A; RAB3A
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The RAS gene superfamily is divided into 3 main branches according to
protein homology. In mammals the first branch includes the classic RAS
genes as well as RAL (179550) and RRAS (165090). The RHO genes (165370,
165380, 165390) belong to the second branch and the RAB genes to the
third. The RAB genes were so named because they were first isolated from
a rat brain library. Zahraoui et al. (1989) isolated cDNAs encoding
RAB3A and several other human RAB proteins. See RAB5A (179512). The
predicted 220-amino acid human RAB3A protein shares 99% and 78% identity
with rat Rab3A and human RAB3B (179510), respectively.

GENE FUNCTION

Giovedi et al. (2004) found that interaction between mammalian synapsin
I (SYN1; 313440) and Rab3a regulated the activities of both proteins.
Synapsin I stimulated the Rab3a cycle by increasing GTP binding, GTPase
activity, and Rab3a recruitment to the synaptic vesicle membrane.
Conversely, Rab3a inhibited synapsin I binding to actin and synapsin
I-induced synaptic vesicle clustering.

Corticoamygdala long-term potentiation (LTP) and late-phase LTP at
hippocampal synapses are 2 forms of LTP that require both postsynaptic
NMDA receptor (see, e.g., 138249) activation and presynaptic protein
kinase A (PKA; see 176911) activation. By in vitro analysis of
transverse slices from the hippocampus and lateral amygdala of
Rab3a-null mice, Huang et al. (2005) found that Rab3a was necessary for
both forms of synaptic plasticity. Rim1-alpha (606629), a
Rab3a-interacting molecule, was also required for hippocampal late-phase
LTP. The findings indicated that presynaptic proteins also play a role
in plasticity that is dependent on postsynaptic activity, thus adding a
layer of complexity to synaptic interactions.

Ruediger et al. (2011) investigated how mossy fiber terminal complexes
at the entry of hippocampal and cerebellar circuits rearrange upon
learning in mice, and the functional role of the rearrangements.
Ruediger et al. (2011) showed that one-trial and incremental learning
lead to robust, circuit-specific, long-lasting, and reversible increases
in the numbers of filopodial synapses onto fast-spiking interneurons
that trigger feedforward inhibition. The increase in feedforward
inhibition connectivity involved a majority of the presynaptic
terminals, restricted the number of c-Fos (164810)-expressing
postsynaptic neurons at memory retrieval, and correlated temporally with
the quality of the memory. Ruediger et al. (2011) then showed that for
contextual fear conditioning and Morris water maze learning, increased
feedforward inhibition connectivity by hippocampal mossy fibers has a
critical role for the precision of the memory and the learned behavior.
In the absence of mossy fiber long-term potentiation in Rab3a-null mice,
c-Fos ensemble reorganization and feedforward inhibition growth were
both absent in CA3 upon learning, and the memory was imprecise. By
contrast, in the absence of adducin-2 (ADD2; 102681), c-Fos
reorganization was normal, but feedforward inhibition growth was
abolished. In parallel, c-Fos ensembles in CA3 were greatly enlarged,
and the memory was imprecise. Feedforward inhibition growth and memory
precision were both rescued by re-expression of Add2 specifically in
hippocampal mossy fibers. Ruediger et al. (2011) concluded that their
results established a causal relationship between learning-related
increases in the numbers of defined synapses and the precision of
learning and memory in the adult. The results further related plasticity
and feedforward inhibition growth at hippocampal mossy fibers to the
precision of hippocampus-dependent memories.

GENE STRUCTURE

Sullivan et al. (1999) found that the RAB3A gene consists of 5 exons
spanning 7.9 kb, and is located 3.7 kb from PDE4C (600128).

MAPPING

Rousseau-Merck et al. (1989, 1989) used the cloned human RAB3A cDNA as a
probe to map the corresponding gene by hybridization to flow sorted
chromosomes and by in situ hybridization. They concluded that RAB3A is
located on 19p13.2. The RAB genes may serve a regulatory function in the
developing nervous system. No oncogenic activity has been demonstrated
as yet for any of the RAB branch family genes. It is noteworthy,
however, that the 19p13.2 site is involved in malignant processes such
as acute leukemias. By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Trask et al.
(1993) assigned the RAB3A gene to 19p13.1-p12.

ANIMAL MODEL

In brain, RAB3A is found specifically in synaptic vesicles. Geppert et
al. (1997) generated Rab3a-deficient mice. They found that the size of
the readily releasable pool of vesicles was normal, but that
calcium-triggered fusion was altered in the absence of Rab3a such that a
greater number of exocytic events occurred within a brief time after
arrival of the nerve impulse. They concluded that RAB3A regulates a late
step in synaptic vesicle fusion.

Kapfhamer et al. (2002) identified a semidominant mouse mutation called
'earlybird' (Ebd) that shortens the circadian period of locomotor
activity. Sequence analysis of Rab3a identified a point mutation in the
conserved amino acid (asp77 to gly) within the GTP-binding domain of the
Rab3a protein in earlybird mutants, resulting in significantly reduced
levels of Rab3a protein. Phenotypic assessment of earlybird mice and a
null allele of Rab3a revealed anomalies in circadian period and sleep
homeostasis, providing evidence that Rab3a-mediated synaptic
transmission is involved in these behaviors.

112262	TITLE *112262 BONE MORPHOGENETIC PROTEIN 4; BMP4
;;BONE MORPHOGENETIC PROTEIN 2B; BMP2B;;
BMP2B1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

BMP4 is a vital regulatory molecule that functions throughout
development in mesoderm induction, tooth development, limb formation,
bone induction, and fracture repair. BMP4 is a member of the BMP family
and transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGFB1; 190180) superfamily of
secretory signaling molecules that play essential roles in embryonic
development (summary by Bakrania et al., 2008).

CLONING

Bakrania et al. (2008) stated that the BMP4 protein is 408 amino acids
long and consists of a TGFB1 propeptide domain and a TGFB domain that
forms an active dimer.

GENE STRUCTURE

The transcriptional unit of the human BMP4 gene is encoded by 5 exons
and spans approximately 7 kb (van den Wijngaard et al., 1996). The human
BMP4 gene has at least 2 functional promoters, which are used in a cell
type-specific manner.

Shore et al. (1998) determined that alternate first exons may be used
and that the first 2 exons are untranslated. The promoter region is
GC-rich and contains no obvious TATA or CAAT consensus sequences. Both
positive and negative transcriptional regulatory elements are contained
within the 5-prime flanking region.

Bakrania et al. (2008) stated that the BMP4 gene contains 4 exons. The
first 2 exons are noncoding.

MAPPING

Dickinson et al. (1990) demonstrated that in the mouse the Bmp2b1 gene
is located on chromosome 14 and maps to the same area as 'pug nose'
(pn). The mutation in that disorder may reside in the Bmp2b1 gene.
Arguing from homology of synteny, Dickinson et al. (1990) suggested that
the human BMP2B1 gene may be located on chromosome 14. Furthermore, they
suggested that a human homolog of the murine Bmp2b2 gene resides on the
X chromosome, as it does in the mouse. There is, however, no direct
evidence of a second BMP2B gene in the human (McAlpine, 1992).

By analysis of human/rodent somatic cell hybrids, Tabas et al. (1993)
assigned the BMP4 gene to human chromosome 14. Using fluorescence in
situ hybridization, van den Wijngaard et al. (1995) localized the BMP4
gene to 14q22-q23. By FISH, Shore et al. (1998) mapped the BMP4 gene to
chromosome 14q21, a region more centromeric than previously reported.

GENE FUNCTION

Shafritz et al. (1996) found overexpression of BMP4 in lymphoblastoid
cell lines from 26 of 32 patients with FOP (135100), but from only 1 of
12 normal subjects (P less than 0.001). Furthermore, BMP4 and its mRNA
were detected in the lymphoblastoid cell lines from a man with FOP and
his 3 affected children, but not from the children's unaffected mother.
Cosegregation of DNA markers for the BMP4 locus on chromosome 14 in the
rare families in which FOP is inherited would strengthen the candidacy
of BMP4, and the demonstration of mutations in the BMP4 gene, especially
in the promoter sequences, would be confirmatory.

In a series of expression studies in mouse, Tucker et al. (1998)
demonstrated that BMP4 activates the expression of Msx1 (142983),
leading to incisor tooth development. BMP4 inhibited expression of Barx1
(603260), which marks presumptive molar teeth, and limits expression to
the proximal, presumptive molar mesenchyme at embryonic day 10.
Fibroblast growth factor-8 (FGF8; 600483) stimulated Barx1 expression.
When BMP4 signaling in early development was inhibited by application of
exogenous noggin (NOG; 602991) protein, ectopic Barx1 expression
resulted in transformation of tooth identity from incisor to molar.

Dlx1 (600029) and Dlx2 (126255) are involved in the patterning of murine
dentition, since loss of these transcription factors results in early
developmental failure in upper molar teeth. Thomas et al. (2000) found
that Bmp4 was coexpressed with Dlx2 in distal oral epithelium and that
it regulated Dlx2 expression by planar signaling. They presented
evidence that Bmp4 and Fgf8 cooperate and regulate the strict expression
of Dlx2 in the epithelium and the mesenchyme in the first branchial arch
in developing mice.

Dooley et al. (2000) investigated the effect of BMP4 on androgen
production in a human ovarian theca-like tumor (HOTT) cell culture
model. BMP4 decreased forskolin-stimulated HOTT cell secretion of
androstenedione and 17-alphahydroxyprogesterone (17OHP) by 50% but
increased progesterone production 3-fold above forskolin treatment
alone. BMP4 markedly inhibited forskolin stimulation of CYP17 (609300)
expression but had little effect on 3-beta-HSD (see 109715), CYP11A1
(118485), or STAR (600617) protein levels. The authors identified the
presence of mRNA for 3 BMP receptors in the HOTT cells model: BMPR1A
(601299), BMPR1B (603248), and BMPR2 (600799). The authors concluded
that BMP4 inhibits HOTT cell expression of CYP17, leading to an
alteration of the steroidogenic pathway resulting in reduced
androstenedione accumulation and increased progesterone production. They
also noted that the effects of BMP4 seem similar to those caused by
activin (see 147290), another member of the transforming growth
factor-beta (TGFB; see 190180) superfamily of proteins.

In chick embryos, the first signs of left-right asymmetry are detected
in Hensen's node, essentially by left-sided Sonic hedgehog (SHH; 600725)
expression. After a gap of several hours, Shh induces polarized gene
activities in the left paraxial mesoderm. Monsoro-Burq and Le Douarin
(2001) showed that during this time period, Bmp4 signaling is necessary
and sufficient to maintain Shh asymmetry within the node. Shh and Bmp4
proteins negatively regulate each other's transcription, resulting in a
strict complementarity between these 2 gene patterns on each side of the
node. Noggin, which is present in the midline at this stage, limits Bmp4
spreading. Moreover, Bmp4 is downstream to activin signals and controls
Fgf8. Thus, the authors concluded that early Bmp4 signaling coordinates
left and right pathways in Hensen's node.

Chen et al. (2002) studied BMP4 gene transfer and osteoinduction by BMP4
using an adenoviral vector to transduce mouse myoblast cells. BMP4
expressed by transduced myoblasts was located in the cytoplasm, and the
differentiation pathway utilized by these cells was converted from a
myogenic to an osteogenic pathway. Injection of the adenoviral vector
carrying BMP4 into the hindlimb muscles of male athymic nude rats
resulted in new bone formation that could be visualized on x-ray films
as early as 3 weeks post injection. Histologic staining of bone tissue
revealed a typical remodeled bone structure.

Cheng et al. (2003) measured the ability of 14 human BMPs to induce
osteogenic transformation in a mouse pluripotential stem cell line, a
mouse mesenchymal stem cell line, and a mature human osteoblastic cell
line. Osteogenic activity was determined by measuring induction of
alkaline phosphatase (see 171760), osteocalcin (112260), and matrix
mineralization upon BMP stimulation. All BMPs except BMP3 (112263) and
BMP12 (604651) were able to stimulate alkaline phosphatase activity in
the mature osteoblasts. BMP4 was able to induce all markers of
osteoblast differentiation in pluripotential and mesenchymal stem cells;
however, BMP4 was a weaker inducer than BMP2 (112261), BMP6 (112266),
and BMP9 (GDF2; 605120).

Paez-Pereda et al. (2003) stated that there is little doubt that
estrogens and growth factors are involved in the control of lactotroph
cell proliferation in the pituitary and that the tumorigenic action of
estrogen in prolactinomas had been demonstrated by in vitro and clinical
evidence. Thus, the number of lactotroph cells increases during
pregnancy. Prolactinomas occur more frequently in women and increase in
size during pregnancy or estrogen treatment, and, at least in human
prolactinomas, estrogen receptor expression is positively related to
size. Paez-Pereda et al. (2003) reported a previously undescribed
mechanism for prolactinoma growth that involved BMP4, SMAD4 (600993),
and estrogens.

By in situ hybridization, Zhu et al. (2004) found overlapping expression
of Bmp4 and Nkx2.1 (600635) in embryonic mouse lung. They presented
evidence that Nkx2.1 activated Bmp4 transcription through 2 Nkx2.1
elements in each of the 2 Bmp4 promoters.

Haramis et al. (2004) used mouse models to demonstrate that BMP4
expression occurs exclusively in the intravillus mesenchyme of the
intestine. Villus epithelial cells respond to the BMP signal. Inhibition
of BMP signaling by transgenic expression of noggin results in the
formation of numerous ectopic crypt units perpendicular to the
crypt-villus axis. These changes phenocopy the intestinal histopathology
of patients with the cancer predisposition syndrome juvenile polyposis
(174900), including the frequent occurrence of intraepithelial
neoplasia. Many juvenile polyposis cases are known to harbor mutations
in BMP pathway genes. Haramis et al. (2004) concluded that their data
indicated that intestinal BMP signaling represses de novo crypt
formation and polyp growth.

The mouse C3H10T1/2 stem cell line can be induced to differentiate into
adipocytes by exposing proliferating cells to BMP4 during a specific
time window prior to induction of differentiation (Tang et al., 2004).
Bowers et al. (2006) identified a subclone of these cells, the A33 cell
line, that was committed to the adipocyte lineage. A33 cells expressed
and secreted Bmp4 during the critical time point in the proliferative
stage. Inhibition of Bmp4 activity by the addition of noggin at the
critical time blocked the ability of A33 cells to differentiate into
adipocytes.

Piccirillo et al. (2006) reported that bone morphogenetic proteins,
among which BMP4 elicits the strongest effect, trigger a significant
reduction in the stem-like, tumor-initiating precursors of human
glioblastomas. Transient in vitro exposure to BMP4 abolished the
capacity of transplanted glioblastoma cells to establish intracerebral
glioblastomas. Most importantly, in vivo delivery of BMP4 effectively
blocked the tumor growth and associated mortality that occurred in 100%
of mice after intracerebral grafting of human glioblastoma cells.
Piccirillo et al. (2006) demonstrated that BMPs activate their cognate
receptor BMPRs and trigger the SMAD signaling cascade in cells isolated
from human glioblastomas. This is followed by a reduction in
proliferation, and increased expression of markers of neural
differentiation, with no effect on cell viability. The concomitant
reduction in clonogenic ability, in the size of the CD133
(604365)-positive population, and in the growth kinetics of glioblastoma
cells indicated that BMP4 reduces the tumor-initiating cell pool of
glioblastomas. These findings showed that the BMP-BMPR signaling
system--which controls the activity of normal brainstem cells--may also
act as a key inhibitory regulator of tumor-initiating, stem-like cells
from glioblastomas and the results also identified BMP4 as a novel,
noncytotoxic therapeutic effector, which may be used to prevent growth
and recurrence of glioblastomas in humans.

Wordinger et al. (2007) studied the effects of altered BMP signaling on
intraocular pressure (IOP) in primary open angle glaucoma (POAG; see
137760). They found that the human trabecular meshwork (TM) synthesized
and secreted BMP4 as well as expressed the BMP receptor subtypes BMPR1
(see BMPR1A; 601299) and BMPR2 (600799). TM cells responded to exogenous
BMP4 by phosphorylating SMAD signaling proteins. Cultured human TM cells
treated with TGFB2 significantly increased fibronectin (FN; 135600)
levels, and BMP4 blocked this FN induction. There was significant
elevation of mRNA and protein levels of the BMP antagonist Gremlin
(GREM1; 603054) in glaucomatous TM cells. In addition, Gremlin was
present in human aqueous humor. Gremlin blocked the negative effect of
BMP4 on TGFB2 induction of FN. Addition of recombinant Gremlin to the
medium of ex vivo perfusion-cultured human eye anterior segments caused
the glaucoma phenotype of elevated IOP. Wordinger et al. (2007)
concluded that these results were consistent with the hypothesis that,
in POAG, elevated expression of Gremlin by TM cells inhibited BMP4
antagonism of TGFB2 and led to increased extracellular matrix deposition
and elevated IOP.

Using RT-PCR, immunofluorescence, and flow cytometric analyses, Cejalvo
et al. (2007) demonstrated that human thymus and cortical epithelial
cells produced BMP2 and BMP4 and that both thymocytes and thymic
epithelium expressed the molecular machinery to respond to these
proteins. The receptors BMPR1A and BMPR2 were mainly expressed by
cortical thymocytes, whereas BMPR1B was expressed in the majority of
thymocytes. BMP4 treatment of chimeric human-mouse fetal thymic organ
cultures seeded with CD34 (142230)-positive human thymic progenitors
resulted in reduced cell recovery and inhibition of differentiation of
CD4 (186940)/CD8 (see 186910) double-negative to double-positive stages.
Cejalvo et al. (2007) concluded that BMP2 and BMP4 have a role in human
T-cell differentiation.

A hair follicle cycles through anagen (growth), catagen (involution),
and telogen (resting) phases and then reenters the anagen phase. Plikus
et al. (2008) demonstrated that unexpected periodic expression of BMP2
and BMP4 in the dermis regulates the process of hair follicle
regeneration. This BMP cycle is out of phase with the WNT/beta catenin
cycle (see 116806), thus dividing the conventional telogen into new
functional phases: one refractory and the other competent for hair
regeneration, characterized by high and low BMP signaling, respectively.
Overexpression of noggin (602991), a BMP antagonist, in mouse skin
resulted in a markedly shortened refractory phase and faster propagation
of the regenerative wave. Transplantation of skin from this mutant onto
a wildtype host showed that follicles and donor and host can affect
their cycling behaviors mutually, with the outcome depending on the
equilibrium of BMP activity in the dermis. Administration of BMP4
protein caused the competent region to become refractory. The existence
of a substance termed 'chalone' had been proposed to explain the
phenomenon of telogen refractivity, which can inhibit anagen
development. Plikus et al. (2008) suggested that BMPs may be the
long-sought chalone postulated by classical experiments. Plikus et al.
(2008) concluded that, taken together, the results presented in this
study provided an example of hierarchical regulation of local organ stem
cell homeostasis by the interorgan macroenvironment. The expression of
Bmp2 in subcutaneous adipocytes indicates physiologic integration
between the 2 thermoregulatory organs.

Using in situ hybridization in human embryos, Bakrania et al. (2008)
authors demonstrated expression of BMP4 in optic vesicle, developing
lens, the diencephalic floor, consistent with a role in pituitary
development, and in the interdigital mesenchyme and the joint primordium
at the stage at which limb buds have formed and are starting to
differentiate into fingers. Because BMP4 interacts with hedgehog
signaling genes in animals, Bakrania et al. (2008) evaluated gene
expression in embryos and demonstrated cotemporal and cospatial
expression of BMP4 and hedgehog signaling genes.

Wang et al. (2008) demonstrated binding between human full-length
triple-helical type IV collagen (see 120130) and BMP4. Based on
experiments in Drosophila, Wang et al. (2008) predicted that a conserved
sequence in type IV collagen functions as a BMP-binding module, and that
type IV collagens affect BMP signaling during vertebrate development.

Limb development is regulated by epithelial-mesenchymal feedback loops
between sonic hedgehog (SHH; 600725) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)
signaling involving the bone morphogenetic protein antagonist Grem1. By
combining mouse molecular genetics with mathematical modeling, Benazet
et al. (2009) showed that BMP4 first initiates and SHH then propagates
epithelial-mesenchymal feedback signaling through differential
transcriptional regulation of Grem1 to control digit specification. This
switch occurs by linking a fast BMP4/GREM1 module to the slower
SHH/GREM1/FGF epithelial-mesenchymal feedback loop. This self-regulatory
signaling network results in robust regulation of distal limb
development that is able to compensate for variations by
interconnectivity among the 3 signaling pathways.

Wandzioch and Zaret (2009) investigated how BMP4, transforming growth
factor-beta (TGF-beta; 190180), and fibroblast growth factor signaling
pathways converge on the earliest genes that elicit pancreas and liver
induction in mouse embryos. These genes include ALB1 (103600), PROX1
(601546), HNF6 (604164), HNF1B (189907), and PDX1 (600733). The
inductive network was found to be dynamic; it changed within hours.
Different signals functioned in parallel to induce different early
genes, and 2 permutations of signals induced liver progenitor domains,
which revealed flexibility in cell programming. Also, the specification
of pancreas and liver progenitors was restricted by the TGF-beta
pathway.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Bakrania et al. (2008) considered BMP4 as a candidate gene for ocular
malformation and digit anomalies (MCOPS6; 607932) and screened 215
individuals with ocular defects, mainly microphthalmia, for cytogenetic
defects by chromosomal analysis, for gene deletions by multiplex
ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), and for mutations in the
BMP4 gene by direct sequencing. They identified 2 individuals with a
14q22-q23 deletion associated with anophthalmia-microphthalmia, 1 with
associated pituitary anomaly. Sequence analysis of the BMP4 gene
identified 2 mutations: a frameshift mutation (112262.0001) in a family
with anophthalmia-microphthalmia, retinal dystrophy, myopia, poly-
and/or syndactyly, and brain anomalies, and a missense mutation
(112262.0002) in an individual with anophthalmia-microphthalmia and
brain anomalies. The finding of expression of BMP4 in developing human
optic vesicle, retina and lens, pituitary region, and digits strongly
supported BMP4 as a causative gene for anophthalmia-microphthalmia with
pituitary abnormalities and digit anomalies. Bakrania et al. (2008) also
identified 4 cases, some of which had retinal dystrophy, with 'low
penetrant' mutations in both BMP4 and hedgehog signaling genes, namely,
Sonic hedgehog (SHH; 600725) or Patched (PTCH1; 601309). Bakrania et al.
(2008) concluded that BMP4 is a major gene for
anophthalmia-microphthalmia and/or retinal dystrophy and brain anomalies
and may be a candidate for myopia and poly/syndactyly. The finding of
low-penetrant variants of BMP4 and hedgehog signaling partners suggested
an interaction between the 2 pathways in humans.

Suzuki et al. (2009) identified mutations in the BMP4 gene (see, e.g.,
112262.0003-112262.0005 and 112262.0007) in patients with cleft lip and
cleft palate (OFC11; 600625). The parents, who also carried the
mutation, had subtle defects in the orbicularis oris muscle on
ultrasound. Overall, BMP4 mutations were identified in 1 of 30 patients
with microform clefts, 2 of 87 patients with subepithelial defects in
the orbicularis oris muscle, and 5 of 968 patients with overt cleft
lip/palate (CL/P). These results indicated that microforms and
subepithelial defects in the orbicularis oris muscle are part of the
spectrum of CL/P and should be considered during the clinical evaluation
of families with clefts.

Reis et al. (2011) analyzed the BMP4 coding region in 133 patients with
various ocular conditions, including 60 with clinical
anophthalmia/microphthalmia (34 syndromic), 38 with anterior segment
anomalies (including 3 patients with SHORT syndrome, 269880), 16 with
cataract, 4 with coloboma, 5 with high myopia, and 10 with other
disorders. In 1 patient with SHORT syndrome, they identified a
heterozygous 2.263-Mb deletion encompassing BMP4 and 13 other genes. In
3 probands with syndromic microphthalmia, they identified heterozygosity
for a 158-kb deletion involving only the BMP4 gene (112262.0006), a
nonsense mutation (R198X; 122262.0007), and a frameshift mutation
(112262.0008), respectively; the affected sister of the proband with the
frameshift mutation carried both the frameshift and a missense mutation
(H121R; 112262.0009).

ANIMAL MODEL

Connor (1996) speculated that transgenic mice with selective
overexpression of Bmp4 may serve as animal models of fibrodysplasia
ossificans progressiva (FOP; 135100) and may make it possible to
evaluate potential therapies directed at influencing the expression of
BMP4 or its 2 types of cell-surface receptors. Not only may this
knowledge provide a rational basis for therapy for FOP, but possibly
also measures for the control of local ectopic bone development, which
occurs in 10 to 20% of patients who have undergone surgical hip
replacement. According to Connor (1996), there appears to be an
individual propensity to the phenomenon of secondary ectopic
ossification of soft tissue. In the 10 to 20% of patients who develop
local ectopic bone formation after hip replacement, if surgical removal
of that bone is attempted or the opposite hip is replaced, ectopic bone
almost invariably recurs or occurs.

Furuta and Hogan, (1998) showed that Bmp4, which is expressed strongly
in the mouse optic vesicle and weakly in surrounding mesenchyme and
surface ectoderm, plays a crucial role in lens induction. In Bmp4-null
mouse embryos, lens induction was absent but could be rescued by
exogenous BMP4 protein applied into the optic vesicle in explant
cultures. In Bmp4-null embryos, Msx2 (123101) expression was absent, and
expression mutant eye explants was rescued by BMP4-carrying beads,
suggesting that BMP4 functions to regulate specific gene expression in
the optic vesicle. No change in Pax6 (607108) was detected in Bmp4-null
eyes.

Using a hypomorphic Bmp4 allele and conditional gene inactivation, Jiao
et al. (2003) circumvented the early lethality of Bmp4 null mouse
embryos and manipulated Bmp4 expression specifically in developing
cardiomyocytes. They found that Bmp4 was dispensable for cushion
formation but was required for proper atrioventricular septation after
cushions had formed. Defects in septation caused atrioventricular canal
defects (AVCD; 600309) that recapitulated the range of AVCDs diagnosed
in patients.

Kan et al. (2004) generated mice overexpressing BMP4 under the control
of the neuron-specific enolase promoter (ENO2; 131360) and observed the
development of progressive postnatal heterotopic endochondral
ossification, a phenotype that matches the anatomic, spatial, and
temporal characteristics of human FOP. The phenotype was completely
rescued in double-transgenic mice that also overexpressed the BMP4
inhibitor noggin, confirming the role of BMP4 in the pathogenesis of the
disease.

Liu et al. (2005) demonstrated that mice with conditional inactivation
of the Bmpr1a gene in the facial primordia developed completely
penetrant, bilateral cleft lip/palate (119530) with arrested tooth
formation. The cleft secondary palate of Bmpr1a-mutant embryos was
associated with diminished cell proliferation in maxillary process
mesenchyme and defective anterior posterior patterning. In contrast, the
mutant mice showed elevated apoptosis in the fusing lip region of the
medial nasal process. Conditional inactivation of the Bmp4 gene resulted
in delayed fusion of the medial nasal process to form the lip, resulting
in isolated cleft lip in all mouse embryos at 12 days after conception.
However, cleft lip was only present in 22% of mouse embryos at 14.5 days
after conception, indicating spontaneous repair of cleft lip in utero
(see 600625). The findings implicated a BMP4-BMPR1A genetic pathway that
functions in lip fusion, and revealed that BMP signaling has distinct
roles in lip and palate fusion.

Fuller et al. (2007) found that Bmp4 and Bmp7 (112267) increased rapidly
at the site of chemically-induced demyelinating lesions in adult rat
spinal cord. The Bmp proteins stimulated Smad (see, e.g., SMAD1; 601595)
activation in mature astrocytes, resulting in increased expression of
chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans and glial scar formation.

Goldman et al. (2009) used Bmp4-hypomorphic mice to investigate the
regulation of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) function and the maintenance
of steady-state hematopoiesis in adults. Reporter gene analysis showed
that Bmp4 was expressed in osteoblasts, endothelial cells, and
megakaryocytes. Resting hematopoiesis was normal in Bmp4-deficient mice,
but cells expressing Kit (164920) and Sca1 (also known as Ly6a, a
mouse-specific gene) were significantly reduced. Serial transplantation
revealed that Bmp4-deficient recipients had a microenvironmental defect
that reduced the repopulating activity of wildtype HSCs. When wildtype
HSCs did engraft in Bmp4-deficient bone marrow, they showed a marked
decrease in functional stem cell activity. Goldman et al. (2009)
concluded that BMP4 is a critical component of the hematopoietic
microenvironment and is involved in regulating HSC number and function.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MICROPHTHALMIA, SYNDROMIC 6
BMP4, 2-BP DEL, 226AG

Bakrania et al. (2008) described a kindred in which members of 3
generations had eye, brain, and digit developmental anomalies (MCOPS6;
607932) related to a frameshift mutation in the BMP4 gene (222del2AG,
S76fs104X). The proband had clinical anophthalmia with no light
perception on the right; the left eye showed microcornea, coloboma,
retinal dystrophy, and tilted optic disc. He had mild learning
difficulties and polydactyly. Cranial MRI showed enlarged trigones,
hypoplastic corpus callosum, and sulcal widening. The maternal
grandmother, who carried the same mutation, showed on MRI enlarged
ventricles, hypoplastic corpus callosum, and marked sulcal widening
associated with diffuse brain atrophy; additionally, she had polydactyly
and finger webbing.

MICROPHTHALMIA, SYNDROMIC 6
BMP4, GLU93GLY

In a patient with eye, brain, and digit developmental anomalies (MCOPS6;
607932), Bakrania et al. (2008) identified a 278A-G transition in the
BMP4 gene that resulted in a glu93-to-gly substitution (E93G). The right
eye of the patient showed microphthalmia, sclerocornea, and orbital
cyst; the left eye showed microphthalmia, coloboma, and microcornea.
Cranial MRI showed delayed myelination and mild reduction in white
matter. The proband had developmental delay, seizures, undescended
testes, simple prominent ears, broad hands, low-placed thumbs, and
dysplastic nails.

OROFACIAL CLEFT 11
BMP4, ALA346VAL

In a child with a microform cleft lip and cleft palate (OFC11; 600625),
Suzuki et al. (2009) identified a heterozygous 1037C-T transition in the
BMP4 gene, resulting in an ala346-to-val (A346V) substitution. His
father, who also carried the mutation, had subtle right microform cleft
lip and a bifid uvula. The microform cleft lip was confirmed by
ultrasound, which detected defects in the orbicularis oris muscle in
both patients.

.0004
OROFACIAL CLEFT 11
BMP4, SER91CYS

In a child with a cleft lip and cleft palate (OFC11; 600625), Suzuki et
al. (2009) identified a heterozygous 271A-T transversion in the BMP4
gene, resulting in a ser91-to-cys (S91C) substitution. The child's
parent, who also carried the mutation, had defects of the orbicularis
oris muscle on ultrasonography.

.0005
OROFACIAL CLEFT 11
BMP4, ARG287HIS

In a child with a cleft lip and cleft palate (OFC11; 600625), Suzuki et
al. (2009) identified a heterozygous 860G-A transition in the BMP4 gene,
resulting in an arg287-to-his (R287H) substitution. The child's parent,
who also carried the mutation, had defects of the orbicularis oris
muscle on ultrasonography.

MICROPHTHALMIA, SYNDROMIC 6
BMP4, DEL

In a 12-year-old Caucasian girl with bilateral microphthalmia and other
eye anomalies, facial dysmorphism, cognitive impairment, and a history
of hypotonia (MCOPS6; 607932), Reis et al. (2011) identified
heterozygosity for a 158-kb deletion on chromosome 14q22.2, with a
minimum interval chr14:53,361,728-53,520,165 and a maximum interval
chr14:53,352,059-53,520,859 (NCBI36), deleting only the BMP4 gene. In
addition to bilateral microphthalmia, the patient had bilateral
persistence of the pupillary membrane, high myopia, strabismus, and
nystagmus. Her dysmorphic facial features included maxillary hypoplasia
with midface flattening, thin upper lip, broad nasal bridge and tip, and
telecanthus, with a preauricular ear tag on the right. She had normal
growth, head circumference, umbilicus, hands, and feet. The patient was
adopted, and no family members were available for study.

.0007
OROFACIAL CLEFT 11
MICROPHTHALMIA, SYNDROMIC 6, INCLUDED
BMP4, ARG198TER

In a Mongolian patient with cleft lip and palate (OFC11; 600625), Suzuki
et al. (2009) identified heterozygosity for a 592C-T transition in exon
4 of the BMP4 gene, resulting in an arg198-to-ter (R198X) substitution.
The parents were unavailable for testing.

In a 19-month-old boy with right clinical anophthalmia and left
microphthalmia, sclerocornea, facial asymmetry, and right-sided
diaphragmatic hernia (MCOPS6; 607932), Reis et al. (2011) identified
heterozygosity for the R198X mutation in BMP4. The boy also had mild to
moderate laryngomalacia, with indentation from the innominate artery,
and bilateral inguinal hernias. He was macrocephalic with a large
anterior fontanel, and had hydrocephalus that was treated with a large
subdural-peritoneal shunt. Brain MRI at 4 months of age confirmed the
ocular findings and showed macrocrania with very prominent subarachnoid
spaces, superimposed overlying subdural collections, as well as diffuse
cerebral atrophy with ventricular prominence. The mutation was not found
in 179 Caucasian, 89 African American, 91 Asian, and 93 Hispanic
controls.

.0008
MICROPHTHALMIA, SYNDROMIC 6
BMP4, 1-BP DUP, 171C

In a 3.5-year-old Caucasian girl with bilateral clinical anophthalmia,
small ears, and small left renal cyst (MCOPS6; 607932), Reis et al.
(2011) identified heterozygosity for a 1-bp duplication (171dupC) in
exon 2 of the BMP4 gene, predicted to cause a frameshift and premature
termination. The proband had normal development, without craniofacial
dysmorphism or anomalies of the hands or feet. Head CT in the neonatal
period showed significantly small globes, minimal ocular tissue, and
absent optic nerves, but otherwise normal brain structures. Her affected
9-year-old maternal half sister was found to be compound heterozygous
for 171dupC and a 362A-G transition in exon 2 of BMP4, resulting in a
his121-to-arg (H121R; 112262.0009) substitution at a conserved residue.
The sister had unilateral clinical anophthalmia, blepharophimosis,
telecanthus, and bilateral postaxial polydactyly of the hands. She had
poor growth, with height and weight less than the third centile, and
relative macrocephaly with frontal bossing. Head CT showed atrophic left
globe and small left orbit. Their asymptomatic mother was heterozygous
for the frameshift mutation, with no evidence of mosaicism; the mutation
was apparently de novo, as the maternal grandparents carried wildtype
BMP4 alleles. The mother was unavailable for examination, so mild ocular
anomalies could not be ruled out, and the father was also unavailable
for study. Neither mutation was found in 179 Caucasian, 89 African
American, 91 Asian, and 93 Hispanic controls.

;;ONCOGENE FGR;;
FGR ONCOGENE;;
SRC2 ONCOGENE, FORMERLY
DESCRIPTION The cell-derived domain of Gardner-Rasheed feline sarcoma virus consists
of a gamma-actin sequence and a tyrosine-specific protein kinase
sequence called v-fgr. By means of a v-fgr probe, Tronick et al. (1985)
isolated a human homolog. Analysis showed that the human DNA is distinct
from all other retroviral oncogenes. They localized the FGR oncogene to
1p36.2-p36.1 by in situ hybridization. By Southern analysis of somatic
cell hybrids, Nishizawa et al. (1986) confirmed the assignment of the
FGR locus to chromosome 1. FGR, which is the presently used designation,
is the same as the oncogene earlier called SRC2. The latter was mapped
to 1p36-p34 by Le Beau et al. (1984) using in situ hybridization and by
Lebo et al. (1984) using dual-beam chromosome sorting and spot blot DNA
analysis. Dracopoli et al. (1988) assigned SRC2 to 1p by analysis of DNA
from a panel of somatic cell hybrids and by linkage analysis in the CEPH
families. The latter studies showed that the SRC2 locus is 3.1 cM from
the Rh blood group locus. They favored the gene order:
1pter--PND--ALPL--FUCA1--SRC2(FGR)--Rh--D1S57--MYCL.

MIXED LINEAGE LEUKEMIA, TRANSLOCATED TO, 7;;
ALL1-FUSED GENE FROM X CHROMOSOME; AFX1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Parry et al. (1994) cloned and sequenced the t(X;11) breakpoint region
from a cell line established from an infant with acute lymphocytic
leukemia. The gene disrupted on the X chromosome, AFX1 (also symbolized
MLLT7), was expressed in a variety of cell types. Sequence analysis
indicated a high degree of homology between AFX1 and the forkhead family
of transcription factors. The high degree of identity within the
forkhead region and the lack of homology outside that region suggested
to the authors that AFX1 represents a novel forkhead family member.

Borkhardt et al. (1997) cloned and characterized the entire AFX gene,
which encodes a protein of 501 amino acids. The AFX protein belongs to
the forkhead protein family. It is highly homologous to the FKHR protein
(136533), the gene for which it is disrupted by the t(2;13)
translocation characteristic of alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma.

GENE FUNCTION

Medema et al. (2000) demonstrated that overexpression of the forkhead
transcription factors AFX, FKHRL1 (602681), or FKHR causes growth
suppression in a variety of cell lines, including a Ras-transformed cell
line and a cell line lacking the tumor suppressor PTEN (601728).
Expression of AFX blocked cell cycle progression at phase G1,
independent of functional retinoblastoma protein but dependent on the
cell cycle inhibitor p27(KIP1) (600778). Medema et al. (2000)
demonstrated that AFX transcriptionally activates p27(KIP1), resulting
in increased protein levels, and concluded that AFX-like proteins are
involved in cell cycle regulation and that inactivation of these
proteins is an important step in oncogenic transformation.

Tang et al. (2002) found that HeLa cells induced to express an active
form of AFX died by activating an apoptotic pathway that included a 4-
to 7-fold upregulation of BLC6 (109565) expression. Examination of the
BLC6 promoter identified 8 AFX binding sites, and AFX binding activated
BCL6 transcription. BCL6 in turn repressed transcription of BCLX
(600039), which encodes an antiapoptotic protein, 1.3- to 1.7-fold. Tang
et al. (2002) concluded that AFX regulates apoptosis in part by
suppressing the level of antiapoptotic BCLX through the transcriptional
repressor BCL6.

Liu et al. (2005) found that Foxo4 repressed smooth muscle cell (SMC)
differentiation in several rodent SMC lines by interacting with and
inhibiting the activity of myocardin (MYOCD; 606127). PI3K (see
601232)/Akt (see 164730) signaling promoted SMC differentiation, at
least in part, by stimulating nuclear export of Foxo4 and thereby
releasing myocardin from its inhibitory influence. Accordingly,
reduction of Foxo4 expression in SMCs by small interfering RNA enhanced
myocardin activity and SMC differentiation. Liu et al. (2005) concluded
that signal-dependent interaction of FOXO4 with myocardin couples
extracellular signals with the transcriptional program of SMC
differentiation.

ATXN3 (607047) functions as a deubiquitinase and as a transcriptional
regulator. Expansion of a polyglutamine tract in ATXN3 causes
spinocerebellar ataxia-3 (SCA3; 107150). Using immunoprecipitation
analysis and protein pull-down studies, Araujo et al. (2011) found that
endogenous ATXN3 interacted directly with FOXO4 in nuclear extracts of
HeLa cells, rat CSM14.1 mesencephalic cells, and mouse brain. The
interaction required the N-terminal Josephin domain of ATXN3. Expression
of ATXN3 enhanced FOXO4-dependent expression of the antioxidant enzyme
SOD2 (147460) in a manner independent of ATXN3 deubiquitinase activity.
Treatment of HeLa cells with H2O2 induced nuclear translocation of FOXO4
and ATXN3, enhanced binding of FOXO4 and ATXN3 to the SOD2 promoter, and
induced SOD2 expression. Coexpression of mutant ATXN3 with an expanded
polyglutamine tract or knockdown of ATXN3 via short hairpin RNA reduced
FOXO4 nuclear translocation and induction of SOD2. Lymphocytes from SCA3
patients exposed to oxidative stress showed reduced binding of FOXO4 to
the SOD2 promoter, concomitant with impaired upregulation of SOD2 and
enhanced oxidative cytotoxicity. Araujo et al. (2011) concluded that
ATXN3 stabilizes FOXO4 and acts as a transcriptional coactivator with
FOXO4 in the oxidative stress response.

GENE STRUCTURE

Borkhardt et al. (1997) found that the AFX gene contains 2 exons. The
single intron is 3,706 bp long.

Peters et al. (1997) found that the AFX1 gene contains 3 exons with most
of exon 3 being untranslated.

MAPPING

The AFX1 gene maps to a YAC contig of chromosome Xq13.1 (Peters et al.,
1997).

CYTOGENETICS

A breakpoint in 11q23 is frequently involved in translocations
underlying hematologic malignancies, especially acute leukemias. The
human homolog of Drosophila 'trithorax,' symbolized MLL (159555), for
'myeloid-lymphoid leukemia' or 'mixed lineage leukemia,' is located at
this breakpoint. Part of the MLL gene is fused with other genes in
leukemia: AF4 (159557) in t(4;11)(q21;q23); ENL (159556) in
t(11;19)(q23;p13.3), AF9 (159558) in t(9;11)(p22;q23), AF6 (159559) in
t(6;11)(q27;q23), and AFX in t(X;11)(q13;q23). Translocations at 11q23
result in the formation of 2 derivative chromosomes that encode chimeric
transcripts. The der(11) transcript contains 5-prime MLL sequences fused
to 3-prime sequences of the gene located on the partner chromosome,
whereas the other derivative chromosome contains the 5-prime sequence of
the partner gene potentially fused to the 3-prime sequence of MLL.
However, in 25% of patients, translocations are associated with
deletions of MLL sequence that is 3-prime to the breakpoint. Thus, in
these cases, a fusion transcript from the other derivative chromosome
cannot be formed. In addition, analysis of complex 11q23 translocations
revealed that the der(11) junction is always conserved. These data
indicate that the fusion transcript encoded by the der(11) must be
critical to leukemogenesis. Corral et al. (1993) found from a partial
sequence of a fusion between MLL and the AFX1 gene from the X chromosome
that the latter is rich in ser/pro codons, like the ENL mRNA. Corral et
al. (1993) concluded that heterogeneous 11q23 abnormalities may cause
attachment of ser/pro-rich segments to the N terminus of MLL, lacking
the zinc finger region, and that translocations occur in early
hematopoietic cells, before commitment to distinct lineages.

Parry et al. (1994) predicted that a chimeric fusion protein that alters
DNA binding activity results from the t(X;11) translocation.

ANIMAL MODEL

The C. elegans transcription factor hsf1 (140580) regulates the
heat-shock response and influences aging. Reducing hsf1 activity
accelerates tissue aging and shortens life span; Hsu et al. (2003)
showed that hsf1 overexpression extends life span. Hsu et al. (2003)
found that hsf1, like the transcription factor daf16, whose human
homologs include FOXO1 (136533), FOXO3 (602681), and FOXO4, is required
for daf2-insulin (176730)/Igf1 receptor (147370) mutations to extend
life span. Hsu et al. (2003) concluded that this is because hsf1 and
daf16 together activate expression of specific genes, including genes
encoding small heat-shock proteins, which in turn promote longevity. The
small heat-shock proteins also delay the onset of
polyglutamine-expansion protein aggregation, suggesting that these
proteins couple the normal aging process to this type of age-related
disease.

Paik et al. (2007) generated null and conditional alleles for Foxo1,
Foxo3, and Foxo4 to assess their role in cancer in vivo. Mice with
germline or somatic deletion of up to 5 Foxo alleles, including Foxo1
+/- Foxo3 -/- Foxo4 -/- mice, had only modest neoplastic phenotypes. In
contrast, broad somatic deletion of Foxo1, Foxo3, and Foxo4 engendered a
progressive cancer-prone condition characterized by thymic lymphomas and
hemangiomas. Transcriptome and promoter analyses of differentially
affected endothelium identified direct Foxo targets and revealed that
Foxo regulation of these targets in vivo was highly context specific,
even in the same cell type. Functional studies validated Spry2 (602466)
and Pbx1 (176310), among others, as Foxo-regulated mediators of
endothelial cell morphogenesis and vascular homeostasis.

Tothova et al. (2007) conditionally deleted Foxo1, Foxo3, and Foxo4 in
the adult mouse hematopoietic system. Foxo-deficient mice exhibited
myeloid lineage expansion, lymphoid developmental abnormalities, and a
marked decrease of the lineage-negative/Sca1-positive/Kit
(164920)-positive compartment containing short- and long-term
hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) populations. Foxo-deficient bone marrow
had defective long-term repopulating activity that correlated with
increased cell cycling and apoptosis of HSCs. There was a marked
context-dependent increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) in
Foxo-deficient HSCs compared with wildtype HSCs that correlated with
changes in genes encoding regulators of ROS. In vivo treatment with an
antioxidative agent resulted in reversion of the Foxo-deficient
phenotype. Tothova et al. (2007) concluded that FOXO proteins play
essential roles in the response to physiologic oxidative stress and
thereby mediate quiescence and enhanced survival in the HSC compartment.

610500	TITLE *610500 ANKYRIN REPEAT AND KH DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1; ANKHD1
;;MULTIPLE ANKYRIN REPEATS, SINGLE KH-DOMAIN, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF;
MASK;;
KIAA1085
MASK-BP3, INCLUDED;;
VPR-BINDING ANKYRIN REPEAT PROTEIN, INCLUDED; VBARP, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Kikuno et al. (1999) cloned ANKHD1, which they designated
KIAA1085. The cDNA contains a short interspersed nuclear element (SINE)
in the 3-prime untranslated region (UTR). RT-PCR ELISA detected
intermediate to high expression in all adult and fetal tissues and
specific brain regions examined, with highest levels in adult heart,
lung, testis, and ovary.

Poulin et al. (2003) cloned 2 cDNAs containing sequences derived from
the human homolog of the Drosophila Mask (multiple ankyrin repeats,
single KH domain) gene. One cDNA contained only MASK sequences, while
the other was an intergenic splice variant containing exons from both
the MASK and 4EBP3 (EIF4EBP3; 603483) genes (see below). The MASK gene
encodes a deduced 2,542-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular
mass of 269.5 kD. The protein contains 2 blocks of ankyrin repeats (10
and 15 repeats, respectively) and a KH domain. Northern blot analysis
detected Mask in all mouse tissues examined. Western blot analysis
detected endogenous MASK at an apparent molecular mass of 270 kD in 293T
cells and in a human prostate carcinoma cell line.

Using human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) viral protein R (Vpr)
protein as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a human brain cDNA
library, Miles et al. (2005) identified 2 splice variants of ANKHD1,
which they called VBARP (Vpr-binding ankyrin repeat protein)-L and
VBARP-S. The 1.9-kb VBARP-L transcript contains 11 exons encoding a
predominantly helical 627-amino acid protein. It contains 12 ankyrin
repeats, several potential serine, threonine, and tyrosine
phosphorylation sites, and 9 potential myristoylation sites, but lacks
the KH domain found in ANKHD1. The 1.3-kb VBARP-S contains 9 exons and
encodes a deduced 435-amino acid protein that is N-terminally truncated
compared with VBARP-L. Real time RT-PCR detected highest VBARP-L
expression in spleen, followed by lung, lymph node, and kidney, with
almost no expression in muscle and brain. VBARP-L was expressed at
variable levels in all cell lines examined, with highest expression in
dendritic cells. VBARP-L and VBARP-S were expressed as cytoplasmic
proteins in transfected HEK293 cells. By RT-PCR, Miles et al. (2005)
found highest expression of an 8.0-kb transcript designated ANKHD1
isoform 1 in cervix, followed by spleen, brain, and lung, with lower
levels in kidney, lymph node, and muscle.

- MASK-BP3 Intergenic Splice Variant

Poulin et al. (2003) identified MASK-BP3, an mRNA of approximately 8.5
kb that hybridized with a 4EBP3 probe in Northern blots and included
exons 1 through 33 of the MASK gene spliced to an intermediate exon 0,
and to 4EBP3 exons B and C. The transcript lacked MASK exon 34 and 4EBP3
exon A. The MASK-BP3 deduced 2,617-amino acid protein has a calculated
molecular mass of 277.2 kD. The first 2,523 residues are identical to
those of MASK, and encompass the 2 blocks of ankyrin repeats as well as
the KH domain. The last 94 amino acids are translated from exons 0, B,
and C. Exons B and C of the MASK-BP3 transcript are translated in a
reading frame that differs from that of 4EBP3. Northern blot analysis of
several mouse tissues detected a Mask-bp3 homolog in all tissues
examined with higher expression in kidney and testis. Western blot
analysis detected both MASK and MASK-BP3 in a human prostate carcinoma
cell line, and both proteins migrated as approximately 270-kD proteins.

GENE FUNCTION

Miles et al. (2005) found that direction of small interfering RNA
(siRNA) against the VBARP variant of ANKHD1 resulted in apoptosis
following transfection in HeLa cells and in a human teratocarcinoma cell
line. The effect was dose- and time-dependent and was associated with
higher caspase-3 (CASP3; 600636) and caspase-7 (CASP7; 601761) activity.

GENE STRUCTURE

Poulin et al. (2003) determined that the ANKHD1 gene contains 34 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Poulin et al. (2003) mapped the ANKHD1
gene to chromosome 5q31.3. ANKHD1 is flanked upstream by the SLC4A9 gene
(601209) and downstream by the EIF4EBP3 gene.

ANIMAL MODEL

Smith et al. (2002) found that in the Drosophila developing eye imaginal
disc, loss of Mask generated phenotypes similar to those generated by
loss of sevenless and Egfr (131550) in the receptor tyrosine kinase
signaling pathway. The phenotype included increased apoptosis, reduced
cell proliferation, and compromised photoreceptor differentiation. While
the loss of Mask also affected other receptor tyrosine kinase-dependent
processes, it did not affect Mapk (see 176948) activation. Smith et al.
(2002) concluded that MASK is a mediator of receptor tyrosine kinase
signaling.

606626	TITLE *606626 DISHEVELLED-ASSOCIATED ACTIVATOR OF MORPHOGENESIS 1; DAAM1
;;KIAA0666
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By screening size-fractionated brain cDNA libraries for cDNAs with the
potential to encode proteins larger than 50 kD, Ishikawa et al. (1998)
identified a cDNA which they designated KIAA0666. KIAA0666 encodes a
1,085-amino acid protein predicted to function in cell division. It is
68% identical to the KIAA0381 protein (DAAM2; 606627). RT-PCR analysis
detected expression of KIAA0666 in all tissues tested.

Habas et al. (2001) identified a novel formin (see FMN1; 136535)
homology (FH) protein that they named DAAM1. DAAM1 is a widely expressed
protein that contains 1,078 amino acids and is identical to the KIAA0666
protein. Like other FH proteins, DAAM1 contains a central proline-rich
FH1 domain and a more C-terminal FH2 domain.

GENE FUNCTION

Wnt (see 164975) signaling via the frizzled receptor (Fz; see 600667)
controls cell polarity and movement during development. Habas et al.
(2001) reported that in human cells and during Xenopus embryogenesis,
Wnt/Fz signaling activated the small GTPase Rho (165390), a key
regulator of cytoskeleton architecture. Wnt/Fz activation of Rho
required the cytoplasmic protein dishevelled (DVL; see 601365) and
DAAM1. DAAM1 bound to both DVL and Rho and mediated Wnt-induced DVL-Rho
complex formation. Inhibition or depletion of DAAM1 prevented Wnt/Fz
activation of Rho and of Xenopus gastrulation, but did not prevent
activation of beta-catenin (116806) signaling.

Liu et al. (2008) showed that human DAAM1 was autoinhibited by an
intramolecular interaction between its N-terminal GTPase domain, which
includes an autoinhibitory domain, and its C-terminal autoregulatory
domain. Interaction of DAAM1 with DVL disrupted this autoinhibitory
interaction, resulting in DAAM1 activation. Mutations within or removal
of the autoregulatory domain converted DAAM1 into an active protein that
could induce Rho activation. Liu et al. (2008) also demonstrated that
Dvl synergized with Daam1 to regulate gastrulation during Xenopus
embryogenesis.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Ishikawa et al. (1998) mapped the DAAM1
gene to chromosome 14.

107266	TITLE *107266 CD22 ANTIGEN; CD22
;;B-CELL ANTIGEN CD22;;
SIALIC ACID-BINDING IMMUNOGLOBULIN-LIKE LECTIN 2; SIGLEC2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The human B-lymphocyte-restricted antigen CD22 is expressed early in
B-cell development in pro-B cells, as a cytoplasmic protein, and later
in B-cell development, at the late pre-B-cell stage, as a cell surface
protein. Once expressed as a membrane protein, CD22 persists on B cells
until they differentiate into plasma cells. The presence of cytoplasmic
CD22 is a useful marker for B-cell precursor acute lymphocytic leukemia.
CD22 appears to be a heterodimer consisting of 130- and 140-kD
glycoproteins with protein cores of 80 and 100 kD, respectively. The 2
subunits are thought to be independently transported to the surface and
originate from 2 separate precursor molecules. Studies of the structure
of the 2 proteins and cDNA cloning suggested that the 2 proteins arise
from differential RNA processing of the same gene, with the larger
subunit being composed of an extracellular portion of 7 immunoglobulin
domains, 1 V-like and 6 C-like, and a smaller subunit of 5 Ig domains, 1
V-like and 4 C-like. The CD22 polypeptide is structurally related to
myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG; 159460), neural cell adhesion
molecule (NCAM; 116930), and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA; 114890).
Consistent with the structural similarities to the adhesion molecules,
CD22 participates in adhesion between B cells and other cell types.
Wilson et al. (1991) cloned a full-length cDNA corresponding to the
B-cell membrane protein CD22.

GENE FUNCTION

Nonhuman mammalian cells express N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) and
N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc). Human cells contain only Neu5Ac
because of an exon deletion/frameshift mutation in cytidine
monophospho-sialic acid hydroxylase (CMAH; 603209), which converts
Neu5Ac to Neu5Gc. Sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectins, or
SIGLECs, such as CD22 (SIGLEC2), recognize sialic acids. Brinkman-Van
der Linden et al. (2000) showed that human SIGLEC1 (SN; 600751) strongly
prefers Neu5Ac over Neu5Gc. Sequence analysis of SIGLEC2 cDNA found that
while the chimpanzee sequence is 97% homologous to human, bonobo and
gorilla are only 96% homologous, and the orangutan is only 93%
homologous. Using regions of SIGLEC2 proteins from mouse, chimpanzee,
orangutan, and human fused to the Fc region of human IgG, and flow
cytometry analysis, Brinkman-Van der Linden et al. (2000) showed that
all bound well to chimpanzee Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed B
cells, which expressed high levels of Neu5Gc. Except for mouse, all
bound well to human EBV-transformed B cells, which expressed high levels
of Neu5Ac.

In a review of immune inhibitory receptors, Ravetch and Lanier (2000)
pointed out that autoimmune disorders may result from the disruption of
inhibitory receptors, particularly in their conserved intracellular
immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs). ITIMs are sites
for alternative phosphorylation, typically by a Src kinase, and
dephosphorylation, either by the tyrosine phosphatase SHP1 (176883) or
the inositol phosphatase SHIP (601582), transducing signals to distinct
pathways. Ravetch and Lanier (2000) noted that CD22 has ITIMs that
interact with SHP1 and oppose activation mediated by the B cell
receptor.

Using murine B-cell lines, Wakabayashi et al. (2002) demonstrated that
CD22 downmodulates signaling through the IgM and IgD B-cell receptors
(BCRs), but not through the IgG BCR, because the IgG cytoplasmic tail
prevents CD22 phosphorylation and actually enhances IgG-BCR signaling.
Wakabayashi et al. (2002) proposed that enhanced IgG-BCR signaling may
be involved in efficient IgG production, which is crucial for protective
immunity against pathogens.

Using yeast 2-hybrid and coprecipitation analyses, John et al. (2003)
found that tyr843 or tyr863 in the cytoplasmic tail of CD22 interacted
with AP50 (AP2M1; 601024), the medium chain subunit of the AP2 complex.
Studies on B cells showed that internalization of CD22 was dependent on
its association with the AP2 complex via tyrosine-based internalization
motifs.

GENE STRUCTURE

Wilson et al. (1993) used a nearly full-length cDNA clone of CD22 to
isolate genomic clones that spanned the gene. The gene covers 22 kb of
DNA and comprises 15 exons.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Wilson et al. (1993) showed that
the CD22 locus is located within band 19q13.1.

ANIMAL MODEL

O'Keefe et al. (1996) made observations in mice with a targeted
disruption of the CD22 gene indicating that CD22 is a negative regulator
of antigen receptor signaling whose onset of expression at the mature B
cell stage may serve to raise the antigen concentration threshold
required for B cell triggering. Splenic B cells from CD22 knockout mice
were found to be hyperresponsive to receptor signaling. Heightened
calcium fluxes and cell proliferation were obtained at lower ligand
concentrations. The mice gave augmented immune response, had an expanded
peritoneal B-1 cell population, and contained increased serum titers of
autoantibody.

Chen et al. (2004) expressed mouse Cd22 in mouse and chicken B-cell
lines devoid of Cd22 and examined B cells from mice deficient in Cd22 or
Pmca4 (108732). They identified an activation-dependent interaction
between phosphorylated Cd22 and Pmca4 and found that Cd22 together with
Shp1 (PTPN6; 176883) provided negative control of B-cell activation by
enhancing Pmca4-mediated calcium efflux after B-cell receptor
stimulation.

153634	TITLE *153634 MACROPHAGE ANTIGEN CD68; CD68
;;MACROSIALIN
DESCRIPTION CD68 is a 110-kD transmembrane glycoprotein that is highly expressed by
human monocytes and tissue macrophages. Holness and Simmons (1993)
isolated cDNA clones encoding CD68 by transient expression in COS cells
and immunoselection using anti-CD68 monoclonal antibodies. Two types of
cDNA clones were isolated, differing by the insertion of 2 short
segments in the N-terminal portion of the extracellular domain. The cDNA
sequence predicted a type I integral membrane protein of 354 residues
with a heavily glycosylated extracellular domain of 298 residues
containing 9 potential N-linked glycosylation sites and numerous
potential O-linked glycosylation sites. The extracellular domain
consists of 2 distinct regions separated by an extended proline hinge: a
distal mucin-like domain and a proximal domain with significant sequence
homology to a family of lysosomal/plasma membrane shuttling proteins
(e.g., LAMP1; 153300). CD68 is a member of a family of hematopoietic
mucin-like molecules that includes leukosialin/CD43 (182160) and stem
cell antigen CD34 (142230).

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Jones et al. (1998) assigned the
linked CD68 and EIF4A1 (602641) genes to 17p13. By interspecific
backcross analysis, they mapped the mouse Cd68 and Eif4a1 genes to
chromosome 8.

610626	TITLE *610626 PPAP2 DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1B; PPAPDC1B
;;HTPAP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Previous studies of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) suggested that
deletion of a region of human chromosome 8p contributes to HCC
metastasis. Using cDNA microarray analysis of chromosome 8 ESTs from HCC
cell lines to identify genes with downregulated expression in high
metastatic potential versus low metastatic potential cell lines,
followed by database analysis and RT-PCR, Wu et al. (2006) cloned
PPAPDC1B, which they called HTPAP. The 175-amino acid protein contains
an N-terminal transmembrane domain, an acid phosphatase homology region,
2 PKC phosphorylation sites, and a tyrosine kinase phosphorylation site.
RT-PCR analysis of 16 metastatic HCC tissues paired with 16 primary HCC
tissues showed downregulation of PPAPDC1B expression in 11 of 16
metastatic lesions compared to primary HCC tissues, with 9 of 16
metastatic lesions showing significant downregulation of PPAPDC1B (P
less than 0.05).

GENE FUNCTION

Using in vitro matrigel assays, Wu et al. (2006) showed that
PPAPDC1B-transfected metastatic HCC cells showed significantly lower
invasion activity. Transfection and expression of PPAPDC1B in nude mice
bearing human HCC significantly decreased the incidence and degree of
pulmonary metastasis of HCC.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Wu et al. (2006) mapped the PPAPDC1B gene
to chromosome 8p12.
