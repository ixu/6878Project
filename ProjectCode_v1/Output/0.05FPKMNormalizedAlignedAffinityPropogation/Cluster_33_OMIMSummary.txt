;;KIAA1237
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA library,
Nagase et al. (1999) obtained a partial HEG1 clone. The transcript
contains a short interspersed element (SINE) in its 3-prime end. RT-PCR
ELISA detected HEG1 expression all tissues examined, with highest
expression in lung, followed by kidney, ovary, heart, brain, and
pancreas. Expression was high in all specific adult brain regions
examined, with highest expression in amygdala, thalamus, subthalamic
nucleus, and caudate nucleus. Fetal brain showed much lower HEG1
expression than adult brain.

By searching databases for orthologs of zebrafish Heg, Mably et al.
(2003) identified a partial human cDNA encoding HEG1. The deduced
1,296-amino acid protein is N-terminally truncated. It has a large
extracellular region containing 2 EGF-like domains, followed by a
C-terminal transmembrane domain and a short intracellular tail. The
deduced full-length 977-amino acid zebrafish Heg protein has a similar
domain structure as human HEG1, and it also contains an N-terminal
signal peptide. Mably et al. (2003) identified 2 other less abundant
splice variants of zebrafish Heg that encode secreted proteins lacking
the transmembrane domain.

Using in situ hybridization, Kleaveland et al. (2009) found that Heg1
was expressed in the endothelium of developing mouse heart and aorta and
in neural tube.

GENE FUNCTION

Using mice and zebrafish lacking Ccm2 (607929) and/or Heg1 (see ANIMAL
MODEL) and CCM2-knockdown human umbilical vein endothelial cells,
Kleaveland et al. (2009) showed that CCM2-HEG1 signaling regulated
endothelial tube formation and endothelial junction formation.
Coimmunoprecipitation experiments and pull-down assays in transfected
HEK293T cells suggested a model in which HEG1 coupled with CCM2
primarily through interaction with KRIT1 (604214) at endothelial
cell-cell junctions. Loss of both Ccm2 and Heg1 resulted in closed
branching endothelial structures that lacked luminal openings.

MAPPING

Hartz (2011) mapped the HEG1 gene to chromosome 3q21.2 based on an
alignment of the HEG1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AB033063) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

ANIMAL MODEL

The zebrafish N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea-induced mutation 'heart of glass'
(heg) is characterized by embryonic lethality with a massively enlarged
heart. The heart enlargement results from abnormal addition of
myocardial cells in a single layer over the endocardium instead of in a
concentric manner, which normally generates myocardial thickening. Using
a positional cloning approach, Mably et al. (2003) identified the Heg
gene and showed that the heg mutation results in a severe truncation
that eliminates most of the protein sequence, including the predicted
EGF repeats. Using selective morpholino perturbation, they showed that
the Heg isoform containing the transmembrane domain was critical for
normal cardiac patterning and growth. Overexpression of all Heg isoforms
in zebrafish resulted in gastrulation defects.

Kleaveland et al. (2009) found that Heg1 deletion in mice resulted in
embryonic and postnatal lethality. At embryonic day 15, Heg1 -/- hearts
showed abnormal invagination of the ventricular cavity and other
structural defects, with blood pooling between the epicardial and
myocardial cell layers. Hearts of neonatal Heg1 -/- mice exhibited
defective cardiac integrity, with rupture of the low-pressure atrial
chamber and blood-filled pericardial sac. Heg1 -/- neonates also showed
dilated intestinal and mesenteric lymphatic vessels that leaked chyle
into the intestinal wall and peritoneal space. Although most Heg1 -/-
mice survived to birth, about half died before weaning as a result of
pulmonary hemorrhage. Embryonic Heg1 -/- mice homozygous for a Ccm2 null
allele had more severe cardiovascular defects and died early in
development due to failure of nascent endothelial cells to associate
into patent vessels. These compound knockout embryos showed complete or
near-complete circulatory block in blood and lymphatic vessels.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The isoprenoid chain of ubiquinone (coenzyme Q) varies in length between
species and is determined by trans-polyprenyl diphosphate synthase.
Humans possess a heterotetrameric decaprenyl diphosphate synthase
composed of DPS1 (PDSS1; 607429) and DLP1 (PDSS2) that produces coenzyme
Q10 ubiquinone (Saiki et al., 2005).

CLONING

By searching EST databases for homologs of S. pombe Dlp1, Saiki et al.
(2005) identified human PDSS2, which they called DLP1. The predicted
399-amino acid protein shares 88% identity with its mouse homolog. DLP1
contains the 7 conserved domains typically found in trans-prenyl
diphosphate synthases, but it lacks DDxxD motifs. Saiki et al. (2005)
also identified a DLP1 splice variant, which they called DLP2, that
encodes a 240-amino acid protein with a unique C-terminal end.

GENE FUNCTION

Saiki et al. (2005) found that expression of human DPS1 and DLP1 in E.
coli resulted in production of Q10 ubiquinone and decaprenol, whereas
expression of mouse Sps1 and Dlp1 produced Q9 ubiquinone and solanesol.
Western blot analysis showed that the proteins were expressed as a
heterotetramer. Expression in E. coli of heterologous combinations of
human and mouse proteins generated both Q9 and Q10, indicating that both
DPS1/Sps1 and DLP1/Dlp1 are involved in determining the ubiquinone side
chain. Expression of the DLP2 splice variant with DPS1 did not result in
Q10 production. Although human DPS1 and mouse Sps1 could complement S.
pombe lacking Dps1, neither human DLP1 nor mouse Dlp1 could complement
S. pombe lacking Dlp1. Saiki et al. (2005) concluded that both DPS1 and
DLP1 are required for generation of decaprenyl diphosphate synthase.

GENE STRUCTURE

Saiki et al. (2005) determined that the DLP1 gene contains 8 exons.

MAPPING

Saiki et al. (2005) stated that the DLP1 gene maps to chromosome 6q21.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In an infant with fatal encephalomyopathy and nephrotic syndrome due to
coenzyme Q10 deficiency-3 (COQ10D3; 614652), Lopez et al. (2006)
identified compound heterozygous mutations in the PDSS2 gene
(610564.0001 and 610564.0002). Biochemical assays with radiolabeled
substrates indicated a severe defect in decaprenyl diphosphate synthase
in the patient's fibroblasts. Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is a vital lipophilic
molecule that transfers electrons from mitochondrial respiratory chain
complexes I and II to complex III, and the PDSS2 gene encodes a subunit
of the first enzyme in the coenzyme Q10 biosynthetic pathway.

ANIMAL MODEL

Peng et al. (2008) found that Pdss2 knockout in mice was embryonically
lethal, with no homozygous embryos surviving beyond embryonic day 10.5.
Pdss2 knockout targeted to renal glomerular podocytes resulted in
nephrotic syndrome but did not alter coenzyme Q levels in whole kidney
homogenates, likely due to the small number of kidney cells affected.
Pdss2 knockout targeted to hepatocytes caused coenzyme Q depletion in
whole liver homogenates, impairment of mitochondrial respiratory chain
function, and disturbance of basic metabolic processes.

In an infant with primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency-3 (COQ10D3; 614652)
resulting in fatal encephalomyopathy and nephrotic syndrome, Lopez et
al. (2006) found compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the PDSS2
gene: a 964C-T transition resulting in a gln322-to-ter (Q322X)
substitution inherited from the unaffected father, and a 1145C-T
transition resulting in a ser382-to-leu (S382L; 610564.0002)
substitution in the seventh conserved domain inherited from the
unaffected mother. Neither mutation was found in 210 control
chromosomes.

Quinzii et al. (2010) studied fibroblasts derived from the patient
reported by Lopez et al. (2006). CoQ10 levels were decreased to 22.4% of
normal, and the cells showed reduced ATP levels, but no increase in
reactive oxygen species or oxidative stress-induced cell death. Quinzii
et al. (2010) concluded that the pathology caused by these mutations was
related to the marked bioenergetic defect, but not to oxidative stress.
The authors suggested that very low mitochondrial respiratory activity
may even confer some resistance to stress-induced apoptosis.

606735	TITLE *606735 OXYSTEROL-BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE PROTEIN 7; OSBPL7
;;OSBP-RELATED PROTEIN 7; ORP7
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

OSBPL7 is a member of the OSBP family of intracellular lipid receptors.
For background information on OSBPs, see OSBP2 (606729).

CLONING

Lehto et al. (2001) used RT-PCR analysis with specific primers to
isolate a full-length cDNA encoding OSBPL7, which they called ORP7.
Sequence analysis predicted that the 842-amino acid protein contains a
C-terminal sterol-binding (SB) domain of approximately 400 residues that
includes the OSBP motif (EQVSHHPP). It has a pleckstrin homology (PH)
domain in its N terminus. OSBPL7 is approximately 76% identical to
OSBPL3 (606732) and OSBPL6 (606734) in the SB domain and 62% and 69%
identical, respectively, in the PH domain. Dot blot analysis revealed
wide expression that was strongest in small intestine and colon,
followed by thymus, spleen, and peripheral blood leukocytes.

Jaworski et al. (2001) cloned multiple OSBPs, including OSBPL7. RT-PCR
analysis detected preferential expression in retina and pineal tissues.

GENE STRUCTURE

By sequence analysis, Lehto et al. (2001) determined that the OSBPL7
gene contains 23 exons. Jaworski et al. (2001) found that it contains 24
exons.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Lehto et al. (2001) mapped the OSBPL7 gene to
chromosome 17. Jaworski et al. (2001) localized the gene to 17q21.2 or
17pter-p13.1.

;;CYCLOPHILIN A; CYPA;;
CYPH
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Cyclophilin is a specific high-affinity binding protein for the
immunosuppressant agent cyclosporin A. Because of its dramatic effects
on decreasing morbidity and increasing survival rates in human
transplants, the molecular mechanism of immunosuppression by cyclosporin
A has been a matter of much interest. Liu et al. (1990) cloned human
cDNA for T-cell CYPH and constructed an expression vector under control
of the tac promoter for efficient expression in E. coli.

GENE FUNCTION

Cyclophilin A (also designated peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase A or
PPIA) is a member of the immunophilin class of proteins that all possess
peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase activity and, therefore, are
believed to be involved in protein folding and/or intracellular protein
transport. Luban et al. (1993) showed that cyclophilin A binds to the
Gag protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). This
interaction can be inhibited by the immunosuppressant cyclosporin A and
also by nonimmunosuppressive, cyclophilin A-binding cyclosporin A
derivatives, which were also shown to exhibit potent anti-HIV-1
activity. Thus, cyclophilin A may have an essential function in HIV-1
replication.

Pushkarsky et al. (2001) identified CD147 (BSG; 109480) as a receptor
for extracellular CYPA. They found that CD147 enhanced HIV-1 infection
through interaction with CYPA incorporated into virions.
Virus-associated CYPA coimmunoprecipitated with CD147 from infected
cells, and antibody to CD147 inhibited HIV-1 entry. Viruses whose
replication did not require CYPA were resistant to the inhibitory effect
of anti-CD147 antibody. Pushkarsky et al. (2001) concluded that HIV-1
entry depends on an interaction between virus-associated CYPA and CD147
on a target cell.

Towers et al. (2003) demonstrated that HIV-1 sensitivity to restriction
factors is modulated by CYPA. In certain nonhuman primate cells, the
HIV-1 capsid protein (CA)-CYPA interaction is essential for restriction:
HIV-1 infectivity is increased greater than 100-fold by cyclosporin A, a
competitive inhibitor of the interaction, or by an HIV-1 CA mutation
that disrupts CYPA binding. Conversely, disruption of CA-CYPA
interaction in human cells reveals that CYPA protects HIV-1 from the
Ref-1 restriction factor. Towers et al. (2003) concluded that their
findings suggest that HIV-1 has coopted a host cell protein to
counteract restriction factors expressed by human cells and this
adaptation can confer sensitivity to restriction in unnatural hosts.

Manel et al. (2010) showed that, when dendritic cell resistance to
infection is circumvented, HIV-1 induces dendritic cell maturation, an
antiviral type I interferon response, and activation of T cells. This
innate response is dependent on the interaction of newly synthesized
HIV-1 capsid with cellular cyclophilin A (CYPA) and the subsequent
activation of the transcription factor IRF3 (603734). Because the
peptidylprolyl isomerase CYPA also interacts with HIV-1 capsid to
promote infectivity, the results of Manel et al. (2010) indicated that
capsid conformation has evolved under opposing selective pressures for
infectivity versus furtiveness. Thus, a cell-intrinsic sensor for HIV-1
exists in dendritic cells and mediates an antiviral immune response, but
it is not typically engaged owing to the absence of dendritic cell
infection.

Using different Apoe (107741) transgenic mice, including mice with
ablation and/or inhibition of CypA, Bell et al. (2012) showed that
expression of Apoe4 and lack of murine Apoe, but not Apoe2 and Apoe3,
leads to blood brain barrier breakdown by activating a proinflammatory
CypA-Nfkb (164011)-Mmp9 (120361) pathway in pericytes. This, in turn,
leads to neuronal uptake of multiple blood-derived neurotoxic proteins,
and microvascular and cerebral blood flow reductions. Bell et al. (2012)
showed that the vascular defects in Apoe-deficient and Apoe4-expressing
mice precede neuronal dysfunction and can initiate neurodegenerative
changes. Astrocyte-secreted Apoe3, but not Apoe4, suppressed the
CypA-Nfkb-Mmp9 pathway in pericytes through a lipoprotein receptor. Bell
et al. (2012) concluded that CypA is a key target for treating
APOE4-mediated neurovascular injury and the resulting neuronal
dysfunction and degeneration.

MAPPING

Using a panel of somatic rodent/human cell hybrids and PCR technology,
Willenbrink et al. (1995) mapped the cyclophilin gene (designated PPIA)
on chromosome 7 and 4 pseudogenes (PPIP2, PPIP3, PPIP4, and PPIP6) to
chromosomes 14, 10, 18, and 3, respectively. Using chromosome 7 and
chromosome 10 deletion hybrid panels, they further localized the PPIA
coding gene to 7p13-p11.2, as confirmed by fluorescence in situ
hybridization (FISH) analysis, and a pseudogene (PPIP3) to the region
10q11.2-q23.

Braaten et al. (1996) mapped the PPIA gene to 7p13 by FISH.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Fraser et al. (2009) introduced dual strategies of ambient temperature
x-ray crystallographic data collection and automated electron density
sampling to structurally unravel interconverting substrates of the human
proline isomerase cyclophilin A. A conservative mutation outside the
active site was designed to stabilize features of the previously hidden
minor conformation. This mutation not only inverted the equilibrium
between the substrates, but also caused large, parallel reductions in
the conformational interconversion rates and the catalytic rate. Fraser
et al. (2009) concluded that their studies introduced crystallographic
approaches to define functional minor protein conformations and, in
combination with NMR analysis of the enzyme dynamics in solution, show
how collective motions directly contribute to the catalytic power of an
enzyme.

ANIMAL MODEL

Sayah et al. (2004) showed that knockdown of owl monkey CYPA by RNA
interference (RNAi) correlated with suppression of anti-HIV-1 activity.
However, reintroduction of CYPA to RNAi-treated cells did not restore
antiviral activity. A search for additional RNAi targets identified
TRIMCYP, an RNAi-responsive mRNA encoding a TRIM5 (608487)/CYPA fusion
protein. TRIMCYP accounts for post-entry restriction of HIV-1 in owl
monkeys and blocks HIV-1 infection when transferred to otherwise
infectable human or rat cells. Sayah et al. (2004) suggested that
TRIMCYP arose after the divergence of New and Old World primates when a
LINE-1 retrotransposon catalyzed the insertion of a CYPA cDNA into the
TRIM5 locus. They concluded that this was the first vertebrate example
of a chimeric gene generated by this mechanism of exon shuffling.

Colgan et al. (2005) found that mice deficient in Cypa were resistant to
immunosuppression by cyclosporine both in vitro and in vivo, as assessed
by proliferation, IL2 (147680) secretion, signal transduction, and tumor
rejection. Cypa-deficient mice remained sensitive to FK506. Colgan et
al. (2005) concluded that CYPA is the primary mediator of
immunosuppression by cyclosporine.

TSC22-LIKE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TSC22D4 is a member of the TSC22 domain family of leucine zipper
transcriptional regulators (see TSC22D3; 300506) (Kester et al., 1999;
Fiorenza et al., 2001).

CLONING

By yeast 2-hybrid screening of a mouse brain cDNA library using TSC22D1
(607715) as bait, followed by database analysis, Kester et al. (1999)
cloned human and mouse TSC22D4, which they called THG1. The deduced
395-amino acid human protein contains a TSC box and leucine zipper
region and has a calculated molecular mass of 41 kD. TSC22D4 shares
similarity with TSC22D1, TSC22D3, KIAA0669, and Drosophila
'shortsighted' shs over the TSC box leucine zipper domain.

Fiorenza et al. (2001) used differential screening by subtractive
hybridization of cDNAs isolated from embryonic day 12.5 wildtype and
Lhx3 (LHX4; 602146) mutant mouse pituitaries to clone mouse Tsc22d4,
which they called Thg-1pit. The 387-amino acid mouse protein shares 79%
amino acid identity with human TSC22D4.

Fiorenza et al. (2001) showed that mouse Tsc22d4 expression in the
pituitary cell line GH3 was induced in response to TGF-beta (TGFB1;
190180). RT-PCR assays detected Tsc22d4 expression during mouse
embryonic development with expression first detected at stage 98.5
followed by a sharp increase during the next 24 hours that coincided
with initiation of Lhx3 expression and preceded formation of the
pituitary rudiment. A second increase in Tsc22d4 expression at embryonic
day 12.5 coincided with development of Rathke's pouch. Tsc22d4
expression was also detected in the entire central nervous system. In
contrast, Tsc22d4 expression in Lhx3 mutant mouse embryos showed an
absence of pituitary expression of Tsc22d4 although expression in the
rest of the brain was no different from wildtype. Fiorenza et al. (2001)
concluded that Tsc22d4 is regulated by Lhx3 during pituitary
organogenesis.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis, gel shift assay, and GST pull-down
experiments, Kester et al. (1999) confirmed that TSC22D4 interacts with
TSC22D1 by forming heterodimers. They demonstrated that TSC22D4 has
transcriptional repressor activity.

103880	TITLE *103880 ALDO-KETO REDUCTASE FAMILY 1, MEMBER B1; AKR1B1
;;ALDOSE REDUCTASE; AR;;
ALDEHYDE REDUCTASE 1; ALDR1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

See aldehyde reductase (103830). Aldose reductase (EC 1.1.1.21) is a
member of the monomeric, NADPH-dependent aldo-keto reductase family and
participates in glucose metabolism and osmoregulation. It is believed to
play a protective role against toxic aldehydes derived from lipid
peroxidation and steroidogenesis that could affect cell
growth/differentiation when accumulated (Lefrancois-Martinez et al.,
2004). It is the first enzyme of the polyol pathway of sugar metabolism,
is most abundantly expressed in adrenal gland, and has been implicated
in diabetic complications (Shah et al., 1997).

CLONING

Chung and LaMendola (1989) cloned and sequenced the aldose reductase
gene from a human placental cDNA library using antibodies against the
bovine lens aldose reductase. The deduced amino acid sequence indicated
that maturation of aldose reductase involves removal of the N-terminal
methionine. Nishimura et al. (1990) also cloned the aldose reductase
gene using synthetic oligonucleotide probes based on partial amino acid
sequences of purified human psoas muscle aldose reductase. Bohren et al.
(1989) isolated aldose reductase and aldehyde reductase cDNAs. They
reported that the 2 proteins are 51% identical. Northern blot analysis
revealed that aldose reductase was expressed as an approximately 1.4-kb
mRNA in placenta.

Graham et al. (1991) determined the sequence of the ALDR1 gene by
analysis of cDNA and genomic clones. The gene codes for a 316-amino acid
protein with a molecular mass of 35,858 Da. A major site of
transcription initiation in liver was mapped to an adenine residue 31
nucleotides upstream from the A of the ATG initiation codon.

GENE STRUCTURE

Graham et al. (1991) determined that the ALDR1 gene extends over
approximately 18 kb and consists of 10 exons, giving rise to a 1,384
nucleotide mRNA, excluding the poly(A) tail. The exons range in size
from 82 to 168 bp, whereas the introns range from 325 to about 7,160 bp.
The promoter region of the gene contains a TATA (TATTTA) box and a CCAAT
box, located 37 and 104 nucleotides upstream, respectively, from the
transcription initiation site. Graham et al. (1991) found 4 Alu elements
in the ALDR1 gene: 2 in intron 1 and 1 each in introns 4 and 9.

GENE FUNCTION

Using specific antibodies, Northern blot analysis, and enzymatic assays,
Lefrancois-Martinez et al. (2004) presented evidence that AKR1B1
detectable in 15-week-old fetal glands is regulated by cAMP in human
adrenocortical cells and thus that AKR1B1 is functionally related to the
ACTH-responsive murine akr1b7/mvdp (mouse vas deferens protein) gene
rather than to its direct ortholog, the mouse aldose reductase akr1b3
gene.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Aldose reductase catalyzes the reduction of a number of aldehydes,
including the aldehyde form of glucose, which is reduced to the
corresponding sugar alcohol, sorbitol (Chung and LaMendola, 1989).
Sorbitol is subsequently metabolized to fructose by sorbitol
dehydrogenase. Under normal conditions, this pathway plays a minor role
in glucose metabolism in most tissues. In diabetic hyperglycemia,
however, cells undergoing insulin-independent uptake of glucose produce
significant quantities of sorbitol. The sorbitol accumulates in cells
because of its poor penetration across cellular membranes and its slow
metabolism by sorbitol dehydrogenase. The resulting hyperosmotic stress
to cells may be a cause of diabetic complications such as neuropathy,
retinopathy, and cataracts.

Epidemiology studies in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes (IDDM;
222100) and noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM; 125853) are
consistent with the hypothesis that a genetic factor influences the risk
for kidney disease of diabetes mellitus (see 603933). Aldose reductase,
the rate-limiting enzyme in the polyol pathway, catalyzes the
NADPH-dependent reduction of sugar aldehydes to their corresponding
sugar polyols. Shah et al. (1997) explored the hypothesis that increased
AR gene expression is a risk factor for nephropathy associated with
IDDM. They studied the following 4 groups: normal subjects, those with
IDDM and no evidence of nephropathy, those with IDDM and nephropathy,
and nondiabetics with nephropathy. They quantitated AR mRNA from
peripheral blood mononuclear cells by RNase protection assay. The
AR/beta-actin mRNA ratio was higher in the group with diabetic
nephropathy (603933) (0.088; CI, 0.06-80.108) than in the group of
normal subjects (0.045; CI, 0.033-0.057; P less than 0.01), the group
with IDDM without nephropathy (0.045; CI, 0.030-0.060; P less than
0.01), or the group of nondiabetics with kidney disease (0.019; CI,
0.011-0.027; P less than 0.001). In contrast, among nondiabetics, the
AR/beta-actin mRNA ratios were 2-fold lower in those with kidney disease
than in the group of normal subjects (P less than 0.01). The authors
concluded that the degree of AR gene expression modulates the risk for
nephropathy in IDDM subjects.

Lefrancois-Martinez et al. (2004) studied if changes in AKR1B1
expression could be associated with adrenal disorders. Relative
abundance of AKR1B1 mRNA was decreased in adrenocortical carcinomas when
compared with adenomas. Most (7 of 8) adrenocortical carcinomas had very
low relative AKR1B1 protein levels when compared with benign tumors
(cortisol-producing adenomas, nonfunctional adenomas,
aldosterone-producing adenomas), Cushing hyperplasia (see 219080), or
normal adrenals.

MAPPING

Using PCR to amplify specifically the human AR sequence in hamster/human
hybrid DNA and also in mouse/human monochromosome hybrids, Graham et al.
(1991) assigned the gene to chromosome 7. The assignment was confirmed
and regionalized to 7q35 by in situ hybridization to human metaphase
chromosomes using a novel, rapid method.

Using a cDNA clone encoding human aldose reductase, Bateman et al.
(1993) mapped gene sequences to human chromosomes 1, 3, 7, 9, 11, 13,
14, and 18 by analysis of somatic cell hybrids. By in situ
hybridization, sequences were localized to 1q32-q42, 3p12, 7q31-q35,
9q22, 11p14-p15, and 13q14-q21. As a putative functional ALDR1 gene had
been mapped to chromosome 7 and a putative pseudogene (ALDRP1) to
chromosome 3, the sequences on the other 7 chromosomes were thought to
represent other active genes, non-aldose reductase homologous sequences,
or pseudogenes.

- PSEUDOGENES

Brown et al. (1992) identified a putative pseudogene (ALDRP1) that
contained no intronic sequences; the functional aldose reductase has 9
introns. In addition, the homology was absent in the region 5-prime to
the transcription start site for the cDNA, implying that regulatory
elements such as the promoter were missing from the pseudogene. They
mapped the pseudogene to chromosome 3 by PCR, using amplimers specific
for it to amplify DNA from somatic cell hybrids.

C3- AND PZP-LIKE ALPHA-2-MACROGLOBULIN DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 6
DESCRIPTION 
GENE FUNCTION

Pregnancy zone protein (PZP), one of the major pregnancy-associated
plasma proteins (see 260100 for another example), was described by
Smithies (1959), who used zone-electrophoresis in starch gels. PZP is a
prominent constituent of late-pregnancy sera. In healthy, nonpregnant
females and in males, PZP is present in trace amounts only: females,
10-30 mg/l; males, less than 10 mg/l. During pregnancy, PZP levels may
reach 1000-1400 mg/l just before term.

Sottrup-Jensen et al. (1984) showed that PZP closely resembles
alpha-2-macroglobulin (103950) in structure. Both have a quaternary
structure of 2 covalently bound 180-kD subunits which are further
noncovalently assembled into a tetramer of 720 kD. Amino acid sequence
of the 2 proteins are extensively homologous.

MAPPING

Marynen et al. (1989) used in situ hybridization and somatic cell hybrid
DNA analysis to demonstrate that PZP, alpha-2-macroglobulin, and an
alpha-2-macroglobulin pseudogene mapped to human chromosome 12p13-p12.2.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By large-scale sequence analysis of a fetal brain cDNA library, Dai et
al. (2003) cloned ZNF461. The deduced 563-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 66 kD. ZNF461 contains a double KRAB domain
at the N terminus and 11 C2H2-type zinc finger motifs at the C terminus,
suggesting a role in DNA binding. It shares 68% amino acid identity with
rat Giot1. RT-PCR detected ubiquitous expression, with highest levels in
liver, kidney, pancreas, thymus, and small intestine.

GENE STRUCTURE

Dai et al. (2003) determined that the ZNF461 gene contains 6 exons and
spans about 26 kb.

DESCRIPTION TRIM proteins are composed of 3 zinc-binding domains, a RING, a B-box
type 1, and a B-box type 2, followed by a coiled-coil region. They are
involved in development and cell growth.

CLONING

By EST database searching for B-box-containing proteins, Reymond et al.
(2001) identified 37 TRIM members, including 3 isoforms of TRIM9.
Northern blot analysis revealed high expression of a 4.4-kb TRIM9
transcript in brain. Fluorescence microscopy demonstrated expression of
TRIM9 in cytoplasmic speckles. Interaction mating analysis indicated
that TRIM9 can form a homodimer.

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a rat hippocampal/cortical cDNA library
with mouse SNAP25b (see 600322) as bait, Li et al. (2001) isolated a
cDNA encoding rat Spring (SNAP25-interacting ring finger protein). The
deduced 710-amino acid rat protein is 98% identical to TRIM9. Expression
array analysis showed exclusive expression and wide distribution in
fetal and adult human brain

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Reymond et al. (2001) mapped the TRIM9
gene to chromosome 14q21-q24.

;;AMPK-RELATED PROTEIN KINASE 5; ARK5;;
KIAA0537
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) cloned KIAA0537. The deduced 661-amino
acid protein shares about 52% identity over 252 amino acids with plant
SNF1-related protein kinase (605705). The KIAA0537 protein had an
apparent molecular mass of about 75 kD by SDS-PAGE. RT-PCR detected
highest expression in heart and brain, followed by skeletal muscle,
kidney, ovary, placenta, lung, and liver. Little to no expression was
detected in other tissues examined.

Suzuki et al. (2003) found that an antibody directed against SNARK
(608131) cross-reacted with a 74-kD protein that they called ARK5. By
screening databases, they determined that KIAA0537 and ARK5 are
identical. Overall, SNARK and ARK5 share 55% amino acid homology,
including 84% similarity within the N-terminal catalytic domains. ARK5
also shares significant homology with several other AMP-activated
protein kinases, including AMPK-alpha-1 (PRKAA1; 602739), AMPK-alpha-2
(PRKAA2; 600497), and MELK (607025).

GENE FUNCTION

By in vitro assay of ARK5 expressed by transfected HepG2 colon cancer
cells, Suzuki et al. (2003) demonstrated phosphorylation of a synthetic
test peptide. The phosphorylation was stimulated by AMP and did not
require accessory binding proteins. Transfection of ARK5 also increased
the survival of HepG2 cells exposed to glucose starvation and reduced
oxygen tension. Increased cell survival was accompanied by
phosphorylation of ARK5 on ser600 by AKT (see 164730), which activated
ARK5 kinase activity. Activated ARK5 phosphorylated ATM (607585), which
led to phosphorylation of p53 (191170). The authors proposed that ARK5
is a tumor cell survival factor that is activated by AKT and acts as an
ATM kinase under conditions of nutrient starvation.

Liu et al. (2012) showed in human and murine cell lines that oncogenic
levels of MYC (190080) establish a dependence on ARK5 for maintaining
metabolic homeostasis and for cell survival. ARK5 is an upstream
regulator of AMPK and limits protein synthesis via the mTOR complex-1
(see 601231) signaling pathway. ARK5 also maintains expression of
mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes and respiratory capacity,
which is required for efficient glutamine metabolism. Inhibition of ARK5
leads to a collapse of cellular ATP levels in cells expressing
deregulated MYC, inducing multiple proapoptotic responses as a secondary
consequence. Depletion of ARK5 prolonged survival in MYC-driven mouse
models of hepatocellular carcinoma, demonstrating that targeting
cellular energy homeostasis is a valid therapeutic strategy to eliminate
tumor cells that express deregulated MYC.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the NUAK1 gene
to chromosome 12.

;;ALKYLDIHYDROXYACETONEPHOSPHATE SYNTHASE; ADHAPS;;
ALKYL-DHAP SYNTHASE
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The first 2 steps of ether lipid biosynthesis, which occurs in
peroxisomes, are the acylation of dihydroxyacetonephosphate (DHAP),
followed by the introduction of the ether linkage by alkyl-DHAP synthase
(EC 2.5.1.26), which exchanges the acyl chain for a long-chain fatty
alcohol. The importance of peroxisomes in mammalian ether lipid
synthesis is demonstrated by human genetic diseases in which peroxisome
biogenesis is disturbed and the patients are ether lipid-deficient (see
600121). To begin understanding alkyl-DHAP synthase and its role in
human peroxisomal disorders, de Vet et al. (1997) cloned cDNAs encoding
alkyl-DHAP synthase from a human liver cDNA library using the guinea pig
alkyl-DHAP synthase cDNA sequence as a starting point. The deduced human
alkyl-DHAP synthase protein has 658 amino acids. Human and guinea pig
alkyl-DHAP synthase have 92% amino acid identity, with completely
identical peroxisomal targeting signal 2 (PTS2) sequences in their
respective N-terminal presequences. The authors reported homology
between human alkyl-DHAP synthase, S. cerevisiae D-lactate dehydrogenase
(cytochrome C) precursor, and E. coli glycolate oxidase subunit D.

De Vet et al. (1998) isolated a C. elegans cDNA encoding a homolog of
mammalian alkyl-DHAP synthase. The deduced 597-amino acid C. elegans
protein is 52% identical to the mammalian enzymes in the overlapping
regions. However, the C. elegans protein carries a consensus peroxisomal
targeting signal-1 (PTS1) at its C terminus.

GENE STRUCTURE

Thai et al. (2001) determined that the AGPS gene contains 16 exons and
spans 30 kb.

MAPPING

De Vet et al. (1998) mapped the human alkyl-DHAP synthase gene to 2q31
by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Thai et al. (2001) mapped the
AGPS gene to human chromosome 2q33 by fluorescence in situ
hybridization.

Liegel et al. (2011) mapped the mouse Agps gene to chromosome 2.

GENE FUNCTION

Using fluorescence-activated cytotoxicity selection followed by colony
autoradiographic screening of the surviving population, Nagan et al.
(1997) isolated a unique plasmalogen-deficient Chinese hamster ovary
cell line. The mutant showed a 90% reduction in the rate of biosynthesis
and levels of plasmalogens. Further studies showed that the mutant is
defective in a single step in the biosynthetic pathway for plasmalogens,
namely the step catalyzed by DHAP synthase. Unlike previously described
plasmalogen-deficient mutants, this mutant contained peroxisomes, as
confirmed by immunofluorescence microscopy and catalase release by
digitonin. Peroxisomal functions, including the breakdown of very
long-chain fatty acids, phytanic acid oxidation, and the acylation of
DHAP, were normal. Cell fusion studies revealed that the mutation is
recessive and belongs to a new complementation group.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Using polyclonal antiserum against alkyl-DHAP synthase, de Vet et al.
(1998) examined levels of this enzyme in fibroblasts derived from
patients with peroxisomal disorders. They found strongly reduced levels
of alkyl-DHAP synthase in both Zellweger syndrome (see 214100) and
rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata (see 215100) patients. A neonatal
adrenoleukodystrophy (NALD; see 601539) patient with an isolated PTS1
import deficiency and a patient with an isolated deficiency in
alkyl-DHAP synthase activity (Wanders et al., 1994; see 600121) had
normal alkyl-DHAP synthase levels. De Vet et al. (1998) analyzed the
cDNA sequence encoding alkyl-DHAP synthase from the latter patient and
found a missense mutation in codon 419, resulting in an arg-to-his
substitution (603051.0001). The authors expressed the recombinant mutant
protein in E. coli and did not detect alkyl-DHAP synthase activity. They
concluded that the arg419-to-his substitution is responsible for the
inactivity of the enzyme in this patient and that arg419 is critical for
alkyl-DHAP synthase enzymatic activity. The arginine-modifying agent
phenylglyoxal efficiently inhibited alkyl-DHAP synthase activity, while
the substrate palmitoyl-DHAP protected the enzyme against
phenylglyoxal-mediated inactivation.

Thai et al. (2001) identified 2 missense mutations in an
ADHAPS-deficient patient: thr309 to ile (603051.0002) and leu469 to pro
(603051.0003). As a consequence of plasmalogen deficiency, structural
alterations of caveolae, clathrin-coated pits, endoplasmic reticulum,
and Golgi cisternae were observed, as well as a reduced rate of
transferrin receptor cycling. The authors hypothesized that
plasmalogens, analogous to cholesterol, are essential for correct
membrane functioning, and their deficiency results in impaired membrane
trafficking.

Itzkovitz et al. (2012) studied 6 new patients with RCDP, 3 with RCDP2
(222765) and 3 with RCDP3, and identified homozygosity or compound
heterozygosity for mutations in the GNPAT gene (see, e.g.,
603744.0007-603744.0009) or AGPS gene (see, e.g., 603051.0004).
Comparison of phenotypic severity and GNPAT and AGPS protein levels
indicated that milder RCDP phenotypes are likely to be associated with
residual protein function. In RCDP2 patient cell lines, GNPAT protein
was undetectable, although AGPS amounts were normal, indicating that the
absence of GNPAT does not affect levels of AGPS at steady state. In
contrast, in RCDP3 patient cell lines, GNPAT protein levels correlated
generally with the amount of AGPS protein present; Itzkovitz et al.
(2012) concluded that at steady state, the amount of wildtype GNPAT was
highly dependent on the presence of AGPS.

ANIMAL MODEL

Blind sterile-2 (bs2) is a spontaneous autosomal recessive mouse
mutation characterized by cataracts and male sterility. Histologic
evaluation revealed that cataracts in bs2 mice were caused by severely
disrupted lens fiber cells. Sterility in bs2 mice was caused by lack of
mature sperm associated with large multinucleate cells within the lumens
of seminiferous tubules. Liegel et al. (2011) identified the bs2
mutation as a G-to-A transition at the +5 position of Agps intron 14.
The mutation resulted in 2 abundantly expressed, aberrantly spliced Agps
transcripts that lacked either exon 14 or both exons 13 and 14. About 7%
of all Agps transcripts were spliced normally. Both aberrantly spliced
transcripts resulted in a frameshift, premature stop, and putative
proteins lacking the enzymatic FAD domain. Mass spectrometry of bs2
showed reduced content of ether-phosphatidylethanolamine and
ether-phosphatidylcholine and increased content of
phosphatidylethanolamine, the precursor for
ether-phosphatidylethanolamine. Elevated phosphatidylcholine was not
observed.

In a patient with rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata and isolated
alkyl-DHAP synthase deficiency (RCDP3; 600121), originally described by
Wanders et al. (1994), de Vet et al. (1998) detected a 1256G-A

substitution.

In a girl with rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata and isolated
alkyl-DHAP synthase deficiency (600121), Thai et al. (2001) detected a
C926T transition, resulting in a thr309-to-ile substitution. The other
mutant allele carried a T1406C transition, resulting in a leu469-to-pro
substitution (603051.0003). The patient was admitted to the hospital at
11 months of age with a phenotype similar to that of her brother who had
died at 2 years of age: short proximal arms, bilateral cataracts,
developmental delay, failure to thrive, gastroesophageal efflux,
microcephaly, and epiphyseal stippling in humeral and femoral bones.

RHIZOMELIC CHONDRODYSPLASIA PUNCTATA, TYPE 3
AGPS, THR568MET

In a 7-year-old Brazilian girl with rhizomelic chondroplasia punctata
and residual GNPAT (602744) activity (RCDP3; 600121), born to parents
without known consanguinity but from close villages, Itzkovitz et al.
(2012) identified homozygosity for a 1703C-T transition in exon 18 of
the AGPS gene, resulting in a thr568-to-met (T568M) substitution at a
highly conserved residue. The mutation was not present as a polymorphism
in dbSNP (build 133). In a cell line from the patient, GNPAT and AGPS
protein levels were normal. At birth, the patient had a wide anterior
fontanel, simple ears, anteverted nares, long philtrum, and thin upper
lip. She had bilateral cataracts, limb contractures with mild pterygium,
slender fingers that were radially deviated, and clubfeet. X-rays showed
short humeri and femurs, stippling at the knees, elbows, scapulae, and
hips, and vertebral coronal clefts. Her general health was good except
for febrile seizures. She smiled responsively at 6 months, and when last
examined at 27 months of age, she had no head support, could not roll
over or hold objects, and had no speech.

607889	TITLE *607889 CKLF-LIKE MARVEL TRANSMEMBRANE DOMAIN-CONTAINING 6; CMTM6
;;CHEMOKINE-LIKE FACTOR SUPERFAMILY, MEMBER 6; CKLFSF6
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the chemokine-like factor superfamily, including CKLFSF6,
share similarity with both the chemokine (see 604852) and the
transmembrane 4 (see 300191) superfamilies of signaling molecules.

CLONING

By screening databases for sequences that share homology with
chemokine-like factor (CKLF), followed by RT-PCR of a prostate cDNA
library, Han et al. (2003) cloned CKLFSF6. The deduced 183-amino acid
CKLFSF6 protein has 4 transmembrane segments. It shares about 31%
sequence identity with CKLFSF4 (607887). Northern blot analysis detected
a transcript of 3.88 kb expressed in leukocytes, placenta, and testis. A
smaller transcript was also detected in leukocytes. Han et al. (2003)
cloned mouse Cklfsf6, which shares about 88.5% sequence similarity with
CKLFSF6.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Han et al. (2003) mapped the CKLFSF6 gene
to chromosome 3, where it resides within a gene cluster with the CKLFSF7
(607890) and CKLFSF8 (607891) genes. They mapped the mouse Cklfsf6 gene
to chromosome 9, where it is located within a similar gene cluster.

190182	TITLE *190182 TRANSFORMING GROWTH FACTOR-BETA RECEPTOR, TYPE II; TGFBR2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By screening a human hepatoma cell cDNA library with a porcine TGFBR2
cDNA as probe, Lin et al. (1992) isolated a TGFBR2 cDNA encoding a
deduced 567-amino acid protein. The protein contains a predicted
cysteine-rich extracellular domain, a single hydrophobic transmembrane
domain, and a cytoplasmic serine/threonine kinase domain. The human and
porcine proteins share 88% sequence identity.

GENE FUNCTION

Growth factor-induced protein phosphorylation plays a key role in the
signal transduction that leads to mitogenic responses. Most growth
factor receptors are transmembrane tyrosine kinases or are associated
with cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases. However, another class of
transmembrane receptors is predicted to function as serine-threonine
kinases. The type II activin receptor (102581) and the types I (190181)
and II TGF-beta receptors (Lin et al., 1992) belong to the
serine-threonine kinase family. The many activities of TGF-beta (TGFB1;
190180) in regulating cell proliferation and differentiation and
extracellular matrix production are mediated through these receptors.
With the use of cells overexpressing truncated type II receptors as
dominant-negative mutants to block type II receptor signaling
selectively, Chen et al. (1993) demonstrated the existence of 2 receptor
pathways. The type II receptors, possibly in conjunction with type I
receptors, mediate the induction of growth inhibition and
hypophosphorylation of the retinoblastoma gene product. The type I
receptors are responsible for effects on extracellular matrix, such as
the induction of fibronectin and plasminogen activator inhibitor I, and
for increased JUNB (165161) expression. Selective inactivation of the
type II receptors alters the response to TGF-beta in a manner similar to
the functional inactivation of the RB protein (614041), suggesting a
role for RB in the type II, but not the type I, receptor pathway.

Expression of the TGFBR2 gene, a putative tumor suppressor gene, is
regulated by ETS transcription factors, of which FLI1 (193067) is one.
Hahm et al. (1999) performed experiments to test the hypothesis that
TGFBR2 may be a target of the EWS-FLI1 fusion protein found in Ewing
sarcoma and related peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumors (see
612219). Their experiments led them to conclude that indeed TGFBR2 is a
direct target of EWS-FLI1.

Ozdamar et al. (2005) demonstrated that PAR6 (607484), a regulator of
epithelial cell polarity and tight-junction assembly, interacts with
TGF-beta receptors and is a substrate of TGFBR2. Phosphorylation of PAR6
is required for TGF-beta-dependent epithelial-mesenchymal transition in
mammary gland epithelial cells and controls the interaction of PAR6 with
the E3 ubiquitin ligase Smurf1 (605568). Smurf1, in turn, targets the
guanosine triphosphatase RhoA (165390) for degradation, leading to a
loss of tight junctions. Ozdamar et al. (2005) concluded that an
extracellular cue signals to the polarity machinery to control
epithelial cell morphology.

Tesseur et al. (2006) found significantly decreased levels of TGFBR2 in
human brain extracts from patients with Alzheimer disease (AD; 104300)
brain compared to controls; the decrease was correlated with pathologic
hallmarks of the disease. Similar decreases were not seen in brain
extracts from patients with other forms of dementia. In a mouse model of
AD, reduced neuronal TGFBR2 signaling resulted in accelerated
age-dependent neurodegeneration and promoted beta-amyloid accumulation
and dendritic loss. Reduced TGFBR2 signaling in neuroblastoma cell
cultures resulted in increased levels of secreted beta-amyloid and
soluble APP (104760). The findings suggested a role for TGFB1 signaling
in the pathogenesis of AD.

GENE STRUCTURE

Takenoshita et al. (1996) determined that the TGFBR2 gene comprises 7
coding exons.

MAPPING

Using a full-length cDNA and a genomic probe in Southern blot analysis
of a human/rodent somatic cell hybrid panel and by direct fluorescence
in situ hybridization to normal metaphase chromosomes, Mathew et al.
(1994) showed that the TGFBR2 gene maps to 3p22. Bonyadi et al. (1996)
mapped the mouse Tgfbr2 gene to distal mouse chromosome 9 within a
region of synteny with human 3p22-p21. The mapping was done by linkage
studies.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Role in Carcinogenesis

Germline (190182.0002) and somatic (e.g., 190182.0001) mutations in the
TGFBR2 gene can result in hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer-6
(HNPCC6; 614331).

Markowitz et al. (1995) stated that transforming growth factor-beta
(TGFB; 190180) inhibits the growth of multiple epithelial cell types,
and loss of this negative regulation is thought to contribute to tumor
development. The TGFB growth inhibitory signal is transduced through 2
receptors, type I (TGFBR1) and type II (TGFBR2), which function as a
heteromeric complex. Markowitz et al. (1995) investigated whether
inactivation of TGF-beta receptors is a mechanism by which human colon
cancer cells lose responsiveness to TGF-beta. They found that the TGFBR2
gene was inactivated in a subset of colon cancer cell lines (referred to
as RER(+), for 'replication errors') exhibiting microsatellite
instability, but not in RER(-) cells. Eight such examples, due to 3
different mutations, were identified. The mutations (e.g., 190182.0001)
were clustered within small repeated sequences in the TGFBR2 gene and
were accompanied by the absence of cell surface receptors. Markowitz et
al. (1995) stated that TGFBR2 mutation, by inducing the escape of cells
from TGF-beta-mediated growth control, links DNA repair defects (120435)
with a specific pathway of tumor progression. The small repeat sequences
in the TGFBR2 gene make it a favorable target for RER(+)-associated
mutator mechanisms. Once generated, the proliferative advantage of cells
with inactivated type II receptor would drive colon tumor progression.
This pathway may also be operative in other human malignancies in which
the RER(+) phenotype has been detected (reviewed by Eshleman and
Markowitz, 1995).

Whereas TGFB inhibits the growth of many epithelial cell types including
nontransformed colon epithelial cells, colon and many other cancer cell
lines are resistant to suppression of growth by TGFB. Parsons et al.
(1995) confirmed the presence of TGFBR2 mutations in 100 of 111 cases of
RER+ colon cancers. As in the report of Markowitz et al. (1995), in each
of these cases, a frameshift mutation was detected within a small
adenine mononucleotide repeat at nucleotides 709-718 of the TGFBR2 cDNA.
Insertions or deletions of adenines within this repeat produce -1, -2,
or +1 frameshift mutations, resulting in predicted synthesis of
truncated receptor proteins of 161, 129, or 130 amino acids,
respectively. Myeroff et al. (1995) demonstrated that TGFBR2 gene
mutations are also commonly present in RER+ gastric cancers. In
contrast, they found that mutations in this gene are distinctly uncommon
in RER+ endometrial cancers.

Souza et al. (1996) analyzed microsatellite instability within the
coding regions of the TGFBR2 and IGF2R (147280) genes. They noted an
anticorrespondence of IGF2R and TGFBR2 mutations. Of 31 gastrointestinal
lesions studied with IGF2R or TGFBR2 mutations, 90% (28) contained
mutations in one or the other, but not both, of these genes. They
suggested that IGF2R and TGFBR2 genes comprise serial points in the same
tumorigenesis pathway.

Tannergard et al. (1997) studied colorectal tumorigenesis in patients
with HNPCC. Tumors from members of 29 HNPCC families known to have
germline mutations of the MLH1 gene (120436) were studied. By using
intragenic markers, inactivation of the wildtype allele of MLH1 was
shown to have occurred through loss of heterozygosity and not through a
somatic point mutation. Microsatellite instability was very common and
occurred early in almost all colorectal tumors from HNPCC patients.
Mutations in the TGFBR2 gene occurred at a high frequency in these
tumors. Of colorectal cancers from HNPCC families, 63% had frameshift
mutations in TGFBR2, compared with 10% of sporadic colorectal cancers.
Mutations in APC (611731) and KRAS2 (190070) appeared to be as frequent
in the HNPCC tumors as in the sporadic counterpart.

Lu et al. (1998) identified a germline mutation in TGFBR2 in an 80-year
old patient with colorectal cancer (HNPCC6; 614331). The patient and her
2 brothers had had colorectal cancers complying with the clinical
criteria of HNPCC, except that the onset of cancer was beyond 50 years
of age in all cases. Constitutional DNA was heterozygous for a
thr315-to-met (T315M; 190182.0002) mutation, whereas loss of the
wildtype allele was observed in tumor DNA. The same mutation was present
in 2 of the patient's 6 children, but they had not developed cancer.

Adjuvant chemotherapy improves survival among certain patients with
stage III colon cancer. Watanabe et al. (2001) studied molecular
predictors of outcome and found that retention of 18q alleles in
microsatellite-stable cancers and mutation of the TGFBR2 gene in cancers
with high levels of microsatellite instability pointed to a favorable
outcome after adjuvant chemotherapy with fluorouracil-based regimens.

- Loeys-Dietz Syndrome

Identification of a 3p24.1 chromosomal breakpoint disrupting the TGFBR2
gene in a Japanese individual with a diagnosis of Marfan syndrome
(154700) led Mizuguchi et al. (2004) to consider TGFBR2 as a gene
underlying a phenotype referred to as Marfan syndrome type 2 (see LDS2B,
610380) which mapped to a locus on chromosome 3p. They identified the
mutation 1524G-A in TGFBR2 (causing the synonymous amino acid
substitution Q508Q and resulting in abnormal splicing; 190182.0004) to
segregate with the phenotype in the French family described by Boileau
et al. (1993). In 4 unrelated probands, they identified 3 other missense
mutations in TGFBR2 that led to loss of function of TGF-beta signaling
activity on extracellular matrix formation. These results showed that
heterozygous mutations in TGFBR2, a putative tumor suppressor gene
implicated in several malignancies, are also associated with inherited
connective tissue disorders. Fbn1 (143797)-deficient mice have excessive
TGF-beta activity that probably underlies their tendency to develop
emphysema and could explain other manifestations of Marfan syndrome
(Neptune et al., 2003). Domain-specific germline mutations of TGFB1
(190180) have been described in Camurati-Engelmann syndrome (131300) and
affected individuals usually have Marfanoid habitus, i.e., long slender
limbs and vertebral deformation. The findings of TGFBR2 mutations
provides further evidence that perturbation of TGF-beta signaling
contributes to the pathogenesis of extracellular matrix disorders.

Among the 10 French probands with a diagnosis of Marfan syndrome
examined by Mizuguchi et al. (2004), only 4 had mutations in TGFBR2.
These 4 individuals shared a common clinical description: prominent
aortic, skeletal, and skin/integument anomalies; mild ocular anomalies
(except for one individual in the original family who had ectopia
lentis); infrequent dural ectasia; and pulmonary abnormalities.

In 10 families with a disorder characterized by widespread perturbations
in cardiovascular, craniofacial, neurocognitive, and skeletal
development (see LDS1A, 609192), Loeys et al. (2005) reported
heterozygous mutations in the genes encoding either TGFBR1 (190181) or
TGFBR2. Loeys et al. (2005) considered TGFBR2 as a candidate gene
because TGF-beta signaling has a prominent role in vascular and
craniofacial development in mouse models (Sanford et al., 1997; Azhar et
al., 2003) and because conditional knockout of TGFBR2 in neural crest
cells causes cleft palate and defects of the calvaria (Ito et al.,
2003). Loeys et al. (2005) sequenced all exons of TGFBR2 and identified
heterozygous mutations in 6 of 10 families (see LDS1B, 610168). The
other 4 families were found to have mutations in the TGFBR1 gene
(190181). Despite evidence that receptors derived from selected mutated
alleles cannot support TGF-beta signal propagation (Mizuguchi et al.,
2004), cells derived from individuals heterozygous with respect to these
mutations did not show altered kinetics of the acute phase response to
administered ligand. Furthermore, tissues derived from affected
individuals showed increased expression of both collagen (see 120150)
and connective tissue growth factor (121009), as well as nuclear
enrichment of phosphorylated SMAD2 (601366), indicative of increased
TGF-beta signaling. The data were interpreted as indicating that
perturbation of TGF-beta signaling is involved in many common human
phenotypes, including craniosynostosis, cleft palate, arterial
aneurysms, congenital heart disease, and mental retardation.

Loeys et al. (2005) reported that histologic analysis in patients with
mutations in TGFBR2 showed loss of elastin (130160) content and
disarrayed elastic fibers in the aortic media similar to that in
patients with classic Marfan syndrome. Structural analysis showed loss
of intimate spatial association between elastin deposits and vascular
smooth muscle cells. These characteristics were observed in young
children and in the absence of inflammation, suggestive of a severe
defect in elastogenesis rather than secondary elastic fiber destruction.
In addition, they had previously observed a marked excess of aortic wall
collagen in individuals with MFS compared with age-matched controls;
this collagen excess was accentuated in individuals with mutations in
TGFBR2. As multiple collagens normally expressed in the aorta are
derived from early-induced target genes of TGF-beta (including COL1A1
and COL3A1), these data were considered consistent with increased
(rather than decreased) TGF-beta signaling.

Disabella et al. (2006) identified 3 different mutations in the TGFBR2
gene (e.g., 190182.0015) in 3 unrelated patients with a phenotype that
they identified as Marfan syndrome. None of the patients had major
ocular signs.

In a Japanese boy with clinical findings reported as Shprintzen-Goldberg
syndrome (SGS; 182212) but consistent with Loeys-Dietz syndrome, Kosaki
et al. (2006) identified heterozygosity for a splice site mutation in
the TGFBR2 gene (190182.0016). Because the patient had a bifid uvula and
sigmoid configuration of the brachycephalic, left common carotid, and
left subclavian arteries, Robinson et al. (2006) suggested that the
diagnosis of Loeys-Dietz syndrome would also be appropriate for this
patient.

Singh et al. (2006) searched for TGFBR1 and TGFBR2 mutations in 41
unrelated patients fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for Marfan
syndrome of the Ghent nosology (De Paepe et al., 1996) or with the
tentative diagnosis of Marfan syndrome, in whom mutations in the FBN1
coding region were not identified. In TGFBR1, 2 mutations and 2
polymorphisms were detected. In TGFBR2, 5 mutations and 6 polymorphisms
were identified. Reexamination of patients with a TGFBR1 or TGFBR2
mutation revealed extensive clinical overlap between patients diagnosed
with Marfan syndrome type 1 (MFS1; 154700), Marfan syndrome type 2, and
Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS2B; 610380).

In 2 male patients with LDS1B who had a significant history of low bone
mineral density and multiple low-impact fractures, Kirmani et al. (2010)
identified 2 different heterozygous mutations in the TGFBR2 gene,
respectively (see, e.g., 190182.0005).

- Susceptibility To Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm

For a discussion of a possible association between variation in the
TGFBR2 gene and susceptibility to abdominal aortic aneurysm, see AAA
(100070).

ANIMAL MODEL

Han et al. (2005) found that human skin cancers frequently overexpress
TGFB1 (190180) but exhibit decreased expression of TGFBR2. In transgenic
mouse models in which Tgfb1 expression could be induced at specific
stages of skin carcinogenesis in tumor epithelia expressing a
dominant-negative Tgfbr2, they observed that late-stage Tgfb1
overexpression in chemically induced skin papillomas did not exert a
tumor-suppressive effect and that dominant-negative Tgfbr2 expression
selectively blocked Tgfb1-mediated epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition
but cooperated with Tgfb1 for tumor invasion. Han et al. (2005)
concluded that TGFB1 induces epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and
invasion via distinct mechanisms: TGFB1-mediated
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition requires functional TGFBR2, whereas
TGFB1-mediated tumor invasion cooperates with reduced TGFBR2 signaling
in tumor epithelia.

Li et al. (2006) found that mice lacking Tgfbr2 specifically in T cells
had lethal inflammation associated with T-cell activation and
differentiation. Maturation of Cd8 (see 186910)-positive T cells and
development of natural killer T cells were inhibited in thymus.
Peripheral Foxp3 (300292)-positive regulatory T cell numbers were
reduced, and Cd4 (186940)-positive T-cell survival depended on Tgfb
signaling. Li et al. (2006) concluded that TGFB has pleiotropic
functions in T cells in terms of T-cell development, tolerance, and
homeostasis.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
COLON CANCER, HEREDITARY NONPOLYPOSIS, TYPE 6, SOMATIC
TGFBR2, 2-BP INS, 1931GT

The mutations identified by Markowitz et al. (1995) included (in the
VACO481 cell line) a GT insertion into a 6-bp GTGTGT repeat at
nucleotides 1931 to 1936. The resulting frameshift was predicted to
substitute a highly basic, 29-amino acid C terminus for the slightly
acidic 33-amino acid wildtype C terminus. The same frameshift mutation
was detected in the primary colon tumor from which the VACO481 cell line
was established, but not in normal colon tissue from the same patient,
indicating that the mutation was somatic and that it occurred before
cell culture.

.0002
COLORECTAL CANCER, HEREDITARY NONPOLYPOSIS, TYPE 6
TGFBR2, THR315MET

Lu et al. (1998) described a heterozygous germline thr315-to-met (T315M)
mutation in an 80-year-old patient with colorectal cancer (HNPCC6;
614331). The other allele was wildtype in the constitutional DNA and
showed deletion in tumor tissue. Unlike patients with typical HNPCC, the
affected members of this family lacked multiple synchronous,
metachronous colorectal cancers and extracolonic cancers. Notably, there
was no microsatellite instability in this case. The patient's 2 brothers
had developed colon cancer at the ages of 65 and 60. The T315M mutation
was found in 2 of the patient's 6 children, neither of whom had
developed cancer. Tissue samples could not be obtained from the brothers
of the patient.

.0003
ESOPHAGEAL CANCER, SOMATIC
TGFBR2, GLU526GLN

Tanaka et al. (2000) identified a missense mutation, glu526 to gln
(E526Q), in the serine/threonine kinase domain of TGF-beta receptor II
in an esophageal carcinoma (133239) tissue sample. The mutant protein
could completely inhibit TGF-beta induction of nuclear translocation of
SMAD4 protein (600993) in esophageal carcinoma cells. This mutation was
not associated with microsatellite instability.

.0004
LOEYS-DIETZ SYNDROME, TYPE 2B
TGFBR2, GLN508GLN

In a large French family in which a Marfan syndrome-like phenotype
mapped to 3p25-p24.2 (LDS2B; 610380; Boileau et al., 1993), Mizuguchi et
al. (2004) identified the mutation 1524G-A in TGFBR2 segregating with
the phenotype. The mutation caused the synonymous amino acid
substitution gln508-to-gln (Q508Q) and resulted in abnormal splicing.

.0005
LOEYS-DIETZ SYNDROME, TYPE 2B
LOEYS-DIETZ SYNDROME, TYPE 1B, INCLUDED
TGFBR2, LEU308PRO

Mizuguchi et al. (2004) identified the mutation 923T-C in the TGFBR2
gene, resulting in the amino acid substitution leu308-to-pro (L308P),
associated with a phenotype identified as Marfan syndrome type 2 (LDS2B;
610380).

In a 17-year-old male patient with Loeys-Dietz syndrome type 1B
(610168), who had a significant history of low bone mineral density and
multiple low-impact fractures, Kirmani et al. (2010) identified
heterozygosity for the L308P mutation in the TGFBR2 gene.

.0006
LOEYS-DIETZ SYNDROME, TYPE 2B
TGFBR2, SER449PHE

Mizuguchi et al. (2004) identified the heterozygous mutation 1346C-T in
the TGFBR2 gene, resulting in the ser449-to-phe (S449F) amino acid
substitution, in association with a phenotype identified as Marfan
syndrome type 2 (LDS2B; 610380).

.0007
LOEYS-DIETZ SYNDROME, TYPE 2B
TGFBR2, ARG537CYS

Mizuguchi et al. (2004) found the mutation 1609C-T in the TGFBR2 gene,
resulting in the amino acid substitution arg537-to-cys (R537C), in
association with a phenotype identified as Marfan syndrome type 2
(LDS2B; 610380).

.0008
LOEYS-DIETZ SYNDROME, TYPE 1B
TGFBR2, TYR336ASN

In their family 6 in which a father and 2 daughters had Loeys-Dietz
syndrome (LDS1B; 610168), Loeys et al. (2005) found a heterozygous
mutation in the TGFBR2 gene segregating with the disorder, a 1006T-A
transversion in exon 4 that resulted in a tyr336-to-asn (Y336N)
substitution in the kinase domain of the protein.

.0009
LOEYS-DIETZ SYNDROME, TYPE 1B
TGFBR2, ALA355PRO

In a family in which members of 3 generations had the Loeys-Dietz
syndrome (LDS1B; 610168), Loeys et al. (2005) found heterozygosity in
affected individuals for a 1063G-C transversion in exon 4 of the TGFBR2
gene, resulting in an ala355-to-pro (A355P) substitution in the kinase
domain of the protein.

.0010
LOEYS-DIETZ SYNDROME, TYPE 1B
TGFBR2, GLY357TRP

In their family 4, Loeys et al. (2005) found that the single patient
with Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS1B; 610168) was heterozygous for a 1069G-T
transversion in exon 4 of the TGFBR2 gene, resulting in a gly357-to-trp
(G357W) amino acid substitution.

.0011
LOEYS-DIETZ SYNDROME, TYPE 1B
COLON CANCER, HEREDITARY NONPOLYPOSIS, TYPE 6, SOMATIC, INCLUDED
TGFBR2, ARG528HIS

In their family 2, Loeys et al. (2005) demonstrated that the single case
of Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS1B; 610168) was heterozygous for a 1583G-A
transition in exon 7 of the TGFBR2 gene that resulted in an
arg528-to-his (R528H) amino acid substitution. R528H had been reported
as a somatic event in colon cancer and shown to cause loss of function
in a transient transfection assay (Grady et al., 1999).

.0012
LOEYS-DIETZ SYNDROME, TYPE 1B
TGFBR2, ARG528CYS

In their family 3 with a isolated case of Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS1B;
610168), Loeys et al. (2005) found a 1582C-T transition in exon 7 of the
TGFBR2 gene, resulting in an arg528-to-cys (R528C) amino acid
substitution.

.0013
LOEYS-DIETZ SYNDROME, TYPE 1B
TGFBR2, IVS1, A-G, -2

In a single individual with Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS1B; 610168) in
their family 5, Loeys et al. (2005) found an A-to-G transition in the
splice acceptor sequence, -2 position, in intron 1 of the TGFBR2 gene
(95-2A-G). This mutation induced use of a cryptic splice acceptor in
exon 2 that resulted in the in-frame skipping of nucleotides 95-112 and
deletion of residues 32-37 in the extracellular domain of the TGFBR2
protein.

.0014
LOEYS-DIETZ SYNDROME, TYPE 2B
TGFBR2, ARG460CYS

In 2 families with thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection mapping to
chromosome 3p25-p24 (LDS2B; 610380), Pannu et al. (2005) detected a
1378C-T transition in exon 5 of the TGFBR2 gene that resulted in the
substitution of cysteine for arginine at amino acid 460 (R460C). The
clinical features of one of these families had been reported by Hasham
et al. (2003). The proband of the second family, a 4-generation family
with autosomal dominant thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection,
presented at 41 years of age with an aneurysm of the ascending aorta and
mitral valve prolapse. Affected members of the family presented
primarily with type A dissections.

.0015
LOEYS-DIETZ SYNDROME, TYPE 2B
TGFBR2, ARG460HIS

In 2 large kindreds with autosomal dominant thoracic aortic aneurysm and
dissection (LDS2B; 610380), Pannu et al. (2005) found a mutation in exon
5 of the TGFBR2 gene, 1379G-A, changing arginine-460 to histidine
(R460H). The proband of 1 family presented with type B aortic dissection
at the age of 43 years. Some affected individuals in this family also
had carotid and cerebral aneurysms and dissections, as well as pulmonary
artery enlargement. The proband of the second family presented at age 42
years with a type A aortic dissection that was surgically repaired. In
the first family, affected individuals presented with aneurysms of both
the ascending and descending thoracic aorta; in the second family, the
majority of individuals presented with aneurysm of the ascending
thoracic aorta.

Disabella et al. (2006) identified a heterozygous R460H mutation in a
24-year-old woman with a phenotype they identified as Marfan syndrome.
An affected father and aunt died of aortic root dissection at age 37 and
45 years, respectively.

Law et al. (2006) described the clinical findings and natural history of
22 carriers of the R460H mutation in TGFBR2 gene in a 5-generation
kindred ascertained by familial aortic dissection. There had been 8
sudden deaths; the cause of death was aortic dissection in all 6 cases
in which a postmortem examination was performed. Three individuals had
undergone aortic replacement surgery. Dissection had occurred throughout
the aorta, and in 1 case in the absence of aortic root dilatation.
Subarachnoid hemorrhage due to a ruptured berry aneurysm had occurred in
2 individuals. Four gene carriers and 1 deceased family member who were
investigated had tortuous cerebral blood vessels. One had tortuous
vertebral arteries, 2 had tortuous carotid arteries, and 1 had tortuous
abdominal aorta. Two individuals were found to have a brachiocephalic
artery aneurysm and a subclavian artery aneurysm, respectively. Despite
the predisposition to aortic dilatation and dissection, members of the
family did not frequently manifest the skeletal features of Marfan
syndrome, with the exception of joint hypermobility. None had ocular
lens dislocation. Striae and hernias were common. There was some overlap
with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV (130050), with soft translucent skin
that was easily bruised.

.0016
LOEYS-DIETZ SYNDROME, TYPE 1B
TGFBR2, IVS5AS, -2A-G

In a Japanese boy with clinical findings reported as Shprintzen-Goldberg
syndrome (182212) but consistent with Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS1B;
610168), Kosaki et al. (2006) identified heterozygosity for a -2A-G
transition at the splice acceptor site in intron 5 of the TGFBR2 gene.
Because the patient had a bifid uvula and sigmoid configuration of the
brachycephalic, left common carotid and left subclavian arteries,
Robinson et al. (2006) suggested that the diagnosis of Loeys-Dietz
syndrome would also be appropriate for this patient.

.0017
LOEYS-DIETZ SYNDROME, TYPE 2B
TGFBR2, MET425VAL

In a man with a diagnosis of Marfan syndrome type 2 (LDS2B; 610380),
Disabella et al. (2006) identified a heterozygous mutation in the TGFBR2
gene, resulting in a met425-to-val (M425V) substitution in the
serine/threonine kinase domain of the protein. The mutation was not
identified in 192 healthy controls. The patient's affected father died
at age 40 years from aortic dissection.

.0018
LOEYS-DIETZ SYNDROME, TYPE 2B
TGFBR2, PRO427LEU

In a patient with Loeys-Dietz syndrome type 2 (610380) , Loeys et al.
(2006) detected a missense mutation, pro427 to leu (P427L), in the
TGFBR2 gene. The female patient had aortic root aneurysm with dissection
and other arterial aneurysms, arterial tortuosity, vascular rapture
during pregnancy, uterine rupture, and splenic rupture. Easy bruising,
velvety skin, and joint laxity were also present.

.0019
LOEYS-DIETZ SYNDROME, TYPE 1B
TGFBR2, ARG495TER

Loeys et al. (2006) pictured a patient with type 1 Loeys-Dietz syndrome
(610168) who carried a heterozygous nonsense mutation, arg495 to stop
(R495X), in the TGFBR2 gene. The man showed hypertelorism and bifid
uvula. Immunostaining of aortic tissue revealed increased nuclear
accumulation of phosphorylated Smad2 (601366) and levels of expression
of connective-tissue growth factor (CTGF; 121009), both indicative of
increased TGF-beta signaling.

;;APG4, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF, B; APG4B;;
AUTOPHAGIN 1;;
AUTL1;;
KIAA0943
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Autophagy is the biologic process leading to intracellular destruction
of endogenous proteins and removal of damaged organelles. ATG4B is a
homolog of yeast Apg4, a cysteine protease involved in autophagy (Marino
et al., 2003).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1999) cloned ATG4B, which they designated
KIAA0943. The transcript contains a repetitive element in its 3-prime
UTR. RT-PCR ELISA detected moderate expression in all adult and fetal
tissues and specific brain regions examined.

By searching for sequences similar to yeast Apg4, followed by PCR of
human cDNA libraries, Marino et al. (2003) cloned ATG4B, which they
called autophagin-1. The deduced 393-amino acid protein contains a
putative active-site cysteine at position 74. ATG4B shares significant
similarity with yeast Apg4, except for divergence at its N- and
C-terminal ends. The absence of an N-terminal signal sequence suggests
that ATG4B is a cytoplasmic enzyme. Northern blot analysis detected a
4.5-kb transcript that was highly expressed in skeletal muscle, with
lower expression in heart, liver, and pancreas. No expression was
detected in fetal tissues. ATG4B was widely expressed in tumor cell
lines.

GENE FUNCTION

Marino et al. (2003) showed that autophagin-1 could complement Apg4
deficiency in yeast, restoring the phenotypic and biochemical
characteristics of autophagic cells.

Apg8 is a ubiquitin-like protein involved in autophagy in yeast, and
there are at least 4 mammalian Apg8 homologs: GATE16 (GABARAPL2;
607452), GABARAP (605125), MAP1LC3 (see 601242), and APG8L (GABARAPL1;
607420). Hemelaar et al. (2003) found that mouse Atg4b acted on the C
termini of these 4 Atg8 homologs, and that the reaction required the
active-site cysteine of Atg4b. Although the amino acid sequences of
these Apg8 homologs differ from one another by as much as 71%, their
affinities for Atg4b were roughly comparable in competition experiments.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Sugawara et al. (2005) reported the crystal structure of human ATG4B at
1.9-angstrom resolution. The ATG4B structure showed a classical papain
(see CTSF; 603539)-like fold and a small alpha/beta-fold domain, similar
to those of ubiquitin-specific proteases, that may be the binding site
for Atg8 homologs. The active-site cleft of ATG4B, which contains the
catalytic triad of cys74, asp278, and his280, is masked by a loop,
implying that a conformational change occurs upon substrate binding.
Mutation of cys74, asp278, or his280 resulted in complete loss of
protease activity.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Marino et al. (2003) mapped the ATG4B gene
to chromosome 2q37.

605298	TITLE *605298 DOWN SYNDROME CRITICAL REGION GENE 3; DSCR3
;;DOWN SYNDROME CRITICAL REGION GENE A; DSCRA
DESCRIPTION Down syndrome (190685), which is characterized by distinct facial and
physical features and mental retardation, is caused by trisomy 21 and is
the most common birth defect. The Down syndrome critical region (DSCR)
extends from DNA marker D21S55 to ERG (165080) in 21q22.2.

By GRAIL analysis of a DSCR contig, searching an EST database, and
RT-PCR, Nakamura et al. (1997) identified a cDNA encoding DSCR3, which
they termed DCRA. The deduced 297-amino acid DSCR3 protein is 92%
identical to mouse Dscr3. Northern blot analysis detected a 3.3-kb DSCR3
transcript in fetal brain, heart, lung, liver, and kidney, and adult
brain, heart, placenta, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, and
pancreas; a 4-kb transcript was also detected in adult skeletal muscle.

186760	TITLE *186760 ANTIGEN CD28; CD28
;;T-CELL ANTIGEN CD28;;
Tp44
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CD28 costimulation is essential for CD4 (186940)-positive T-cell
proliferation, survival, interleukin-2 (IL2; 147680) production, and
T-helper type-2 (Th2) development.

CLONING

Monoclonal antibodies recognize 3 antigens, CD3 (186790), CD2 (186990),
and CD28 (Tp44), that cause human T cells to proliferate in the presence
of phorbol esters. Whereas CD3 appeared to be involved in transduction
of the signal generated by antigen binding to the T-cell receptor, the
role of the CD2 and CD28 antigens in physiologic proliferation was not
understood. Aruffo and Seed (1987) isolated a cDNA clone encoding CD28
by a simple and highly efficient cloning strategy based on transient
expression. In COS cells the CD28 encodes a highly glycosylated membrane
protein with homology to the immunoglobulin superfamily.

Magistrelli et al. (1999) identified 3 CD28 splice variants in
nonactivated T cells: CD28a, which lacks exon 3, leading to loss of the
transmembrane domain; CD28b, which lacks most of the 3-prime end of exon
2 and exon 3; and CD28c, which lacks exon 2 and exon 3. CD28b and CD28c
were expressed at a low level relative to CD28a. Magistrelli et al.
(1999) suggested that resting T cells may constitutively express both
membrane and soluble CD28, potentially regulating the T-cell response at
different levels.

GENE FUNCTION

Harada et al. (2003) noted that the CD28 cytoplasmic domain contains a
YMNM motif, which binds PI3K (see 601232) and GRB2 (108355), whereas the
corresponding region of ICOS (604558) contains a YMFM motif, which binds
the former but not the latter. Harada et al. (2003) hypothesized that
the reason CD28 signaling, but not ICOS signaling, induces IL2
production is its ability to bind GRB2. To test this hypothesis, they
generated mutant ICOS containing the YMNM motif of CD28. This alteration
allowed ICOS to activate the IL2 promoter, and further analysis showed
that GRB2 binding to ICOS led to activation of the NFAT (see 600490)/AP1
(165160) site in the IL2 promoter. Harada et al. (2003) concluded that
the difference of a single amino acid defines a functional difference
between CD28- and ICOS-mediated costimulatory signals.

By a comprehensive structure-function analysis of the mouse Cd28
cytoplasmic tail, Andres et al. (2004) found that Il2 production and
T-cell proliferation did not require a particular cytoplasmic domain.
However, Il4 (147780) production was driven by cooperative activity of
at least 2 structural motifs, a pro-rich motif at residues 187 to 190
and tyr residues at positions 170 and 188, within the Cd28 cytoplasmic
tail. A gene complementation approach determined that Pdk1 (605213), but
not Itk (186973) or Akt (164730), in an Akt-independent pathway,
mediated a component of the Il4 signal induced by Cd28.

CTLA4 shares 2 ligands, CD80 (112203) and CD86 (601020), with a
stimulatory receptor, CD28. Qureshi et al. (2011) showed that CTLA4 can
capture its ligands from opposing cells by a process of
trans-endocytosis. After removal, these costimulatory ligands are
degraded inside CTLA4-expressing cells, resulting in impaired
costimulation via CD28. Acquisition of CD86 from antigen-presenting
cells is stimulated by T cell receptor engagement and observed in vitro
and in vivo. Qureshi et al. (2011) concluded that their data revealed a
mechanism of immune regulation in which CTLA4 acts as an effector
molecule to inhibit CD28 costimulation by the cell-extrinsic depletion
of ligands, accounting for many of the features of the CD28-CTLA4
system.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lee et al. (1990) found that the CD28 gene is present in single copy and
is organized into 4 exons, each of which defines a functional domain of
the predicted protein. Posttranslational processing appears to result in
variant isotypes of CD28 with potentially different physiologic roles on
the cell surface.

MAPPING

Using in situ hybridization on prometaphase cells, Lafage-Pochitaloff et
al. (1990) demonstrated that the CD28 gene maps to 2q33-q34. The CTLA4
gene (123890) maps to the same region. Both are members of the Ig
superfamily, where they define a subgroup of membrane-bound single V
domains. The chromosomal proximity of CD28 and CTLA4 and their close
structural relationship suggest that these 2 genes resulted from
duplication of a common evolutionary precursor and that they share some
functional properties. By means of intersubspecific crosses, Howard et
al. (1991) mapped the Cd28 gene to the proximal part of mouse chromosome
1. By study of yeast artificial chromosomes (YAC), Buonavista et al.
(1992) demonstrated that the CD28 and CTLA4 genes were in the same
fragment, indicating that they were separated by only 25 to 150 kb. A
CpG island was found between these genes.

ANIMAL MODEL

CD28 undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation after interacting with its
ligand, B7 (CD80; 112203). Phosphorylation of tyr173 (tyr170 in mouse)
in the cytoplasmic domain of CD28 allows the recruitment of signaling
proteins such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (see PIK3R1; 171833),
GRB2 (108355), and GADS (GRAP2; 604518) via their SH2 domains. Okkenhaug
et al. (2001) reconstituted CD28 knockout mice with transgenes encoding
wildtype Cd28 or Cd28 carrying a tyr170-to-phe mutation. Mutant Cd28 did
not bind to the SH2 domain of PIK3R1, resulting in diminished protein
kinase B (164730) activation. Mutant Cd28 was able to prevent the
induction of anergy, to promote T-cell proliferation and IL2 secretion,
and to provide B-cell help, but was unable to upregulate expression of
the prosurvival protein BCLXL (600039). The defect in BCLXL upregulation
was correlated with increased susceptibility of the T cells to gamma
radiation. Okkenhaug et al. (2001) suggested that other tyrosine
residues or asn172 may be critical to functions not affected by the
tyr170-to-phe mutation.
