606420	TITLE *606420 ENGULFMENT AND CELL MOTILITY GENE 1; ELMO1
;;CED12, C. ELEGANS, HOMOLOG OF, 1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The C. elegans genes Ced2, Ced5, and Ced10 and their mammalian homologs
CRKII (164762), DOCK180 (601403), and RAC1 (602048), respectively,
mediate cytoskeletal rearrangements during phagocytosis of apoptotic
cells and cell motility. Gumienny et al. (2001) identified Ced12, an
additional member of the C. elegans signaling pathway, and mouse and
human Ced12 homologs, which they termed ELMO1, ELMO2 (606421), and ELMO3
(606422). They cloned a full-length human cDNA encoding ELMO1 from a
macrophage cDNA library. The predicted 727-amino acid ELMO1 polypeptide
is 44% similar to C. elegans Ced12, 75% identical to ELMO2, and 98%
identical to mouse Elmo1. Northern blot analysis detected wide
expression of a 4.2-kb ELMO1 transcript. Computer analysis predicted
that ELMO1 and ELMO2 are soluble cytoplasmic proteins.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Gumienny et al. (2001) mapped the ELMO1
gene to chromosome 7.

GENE FUNCTION

Gumienny et al. (2001) determined that in C. elegans, Ced12 is required
for engulfment of dying cells and for cell migrations. In mammalian
cells, ELMO1 functionally cooperated with CRKII and DOCK180 to promote
phagocytosis and cell shape changes. Ced12/ELMO1 bound directly to
Ced5/DOCK180. This evolutionarily conserved complex stimulated a
Rac-GEF, leading to RAC1 activation and cytoskeletal rearrangements.
These studies identified Ced12/ELMO as an upstream regulator of RAC1
that affects engulfment and cell migration from C. elegans to mammals.

Using mass spectrometric analysis, Scott et al. (2002) identified 25
potential binding partners in a human monocyte cell line for the SH3
domain of HCK (142370). Analysis with purified proteins and in intact
cells confirmed the interactions with WIP (WIPF1; 602357), WASP (WAS;
300392), and ELMO1. ELMO1 was heavily tyrosine phosphorylated in cells
coexpressing HCK and ELMO1, suggesting that ELMO1 is a HCK substrate.
Pull-down analysis showed that binding of ELMO1 to the HCK SH3 domain
could be inhibited by polyproline peptides, indicating that an ELMO1
polyproline motif interacts with HCK. Scott et al. (2002) concluded that
WIP, WASP, and ELMO1 may be activators or effectors of HCK.

Park et al. (2007) identified brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor-1
(BAI1; 602682) as a receptor upstream of ELMO and as a receptor that can
bind phosphatidylserine on apoptotic cells. BAI1 is a 7-transmembrane
protein belonging to the adhesion-type G protein-coupled receptor family
with an extended extracellular region. Park et al. (2007) showed that
BAI1 functions as an engulfment receptor in both the recognition and
subsequent internalization of apoptotic cells. Through multiple lines of
investigation, Park et al. (2007) identified phosphatidylserine, a key
'eat-me' signal exposed on apoptotic cells, as a ligand for BAI1. The
thrombospondin type 1 (188060) repeats within the extracellular region
of BAI1 mediate direct binding to phosphatidylserine. As with
intracellular signaling, BAI1 forms a trimeric complex with ELMO and
Dock180, and functional studies suggested that BAI1 cooperates with
ELMO/Dock180/Rac to promote maximal engulfment of apoptotic cells. Last,
Park et al. (2007) found that decreased BAI1 expression or interference
with BAI1 function inhibited the engulfment of apoptotic targets ex vivo
and in vivo. Thus, Park et al. (2007) concluded that BAI1 is a
phosphatidylserine recognition receptor that can directly recruit a
Rac-GEF complex to mediate the uptake of apoptotic cells.

Shimazaki et al. (2005) performed in situ hybridization using kidney
from normal and diabetic mice and observed ELMO1 expression primarily in
tubular and glomerular epithelial cells that was weak in normal kidney
but clearly elevated in diabetic kidney. In vitro analysis revealed
increased ELMO1 expression in cells cultured under high glucose
conditions compared to those under normal glucose conditions. Expression
of extracellular matrix protein genes such as type I collagen (120150)
and fibronectin (135600) was increased in cells overexpressing ELMO1,
whereas the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (see MMP2, 120360)
was decreased.

Thirty percent of all cortical interneurons arise from a relatively
novel source within the ventral telencephalon, the caudal ganglionic
eminence (CGE) (summary by De Marco Garcia et al., 2011). Owing to their
late birth date, these interneurons populate the cortex only after the
majority of other interneurons and pyramidal cells are already in place
and have started to functionally integrate. De Marco Garcia et al.
(2011) demonstrated in mice that for CGE-derived reelin
(600514)-positive and calretinin (114051)-positive, but not vasoactive
intestinal peptide (VIP; 192320)-positive, interneurons, activity is
essential before postnatal day 3 for correct migration, and that after
postnatal day 3, glutamate-mediated activity controls the development of
their axons and dendrites. Furthermore, De Marco Garcia et al. (2011)
showed that Elmo1, a target of the transcription factor distal-less
homeobox-1 (Dlx1; 600029), is selectively expressed in reelin-positive
and calretinin-positive interneurons and is both necessary and
sufficient for activity-dependent interneuron migration. De Marco Garcia
et al. (2011) concluded that their findings revealed a selective
requirement for activity in shaping the cortical integration of specific
neuronal subtypes.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

For discussion of a possible association between microvascular
complications of diabetes and variation in the ELMO1 gene, see MVCD1
(603933).

ANIMAL MODEL

Elliott et al. (2010) generated mice deficient in Elmo1 by targeted
disruption and found them, unexpectedly, to be viable and grossly
normal. However, Elmo1-null mice had a striking testicular pathology,
with disrupted seminiferous epithelium, multinucleated giant cells,
uncleared apoptotic germ cells, and decreased sperm output. Subsequent
in vitro and in vivo analyses revealed a crucial role for Elmo1 in the
phagocytic clearance of apoptotic germ cells by Sertoli cells lining the
seminiferous epithelium. The engulfment receptor Bai1 and Rac1 (602048),
upstream and downstream of Elmo1, respectively, were also important for
Sertoli cell-mediated engulfment. Elliott et al. (2010) concluded that
collectively, their findings uncovered a selective requirement for ELMO1
Sertoli cell-mediated removal of apoptotic germ cells and made a
compelling case for a relationship between engulfment and tissue
homeostasis in vivo.

;;MICROTUBULE-ASSOCIATED PROTEINS 1A AND 1B, LIGHT CHAIN 3;;
MAP1ALC3;;
MAP1BLC3;;

LC3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Microtubule-associated proteins MAP1A (600178) and MAP1B (157129)
constitute nearly half of the mass of all the microtubule associated
proteins that copurify with brain microtubules. MAP1A and MAP1B are each
composed of a heavy chain and multiple light-chain subunits. Two of
these light-chain subunits, LC1 and LC2, are encoded within the 3-prime
end of the same open reading frames that encode the MAP1B and MAP1A
heavy chains, respectively (Hammarback et al., 1991; Langkopf et al.,
1992). Mann and Hammarback (1996) examined the expression of another
light chain, LC3, which is a component of both MAP1A and MAP1B
microtubule-binding complexes. They found that, although LC3 was
expressed exclusively in cells expressing heavy chains, developmental
changes in the total amount of LC3 protein were not proportional to the
amounts of either heavy chain MAP1A or MAP1B. Using LC3-specific
oligonucleotides, Mann and Hammarback (1996) amplified a 300-bp LC3
fragment from a human retina cDNA library.

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to rat Map1lc3,
followed by PCR of a heart cDNA library, He et al. (2003) cloned
MAP1LC3A. The deduced 121-amino acid protein shares 81% identity with
rat Map1lc3. Northern blot analysis detected a 1.1-kb transcript in most
tissues examined, with highest expression in heart, brain, liver,
skeletal muscle, and testis. No MAP1LC3A expression was detected in
thymus and peripheral blood leukocytes. Western blot analysis of
transfected human embryonic kidney cells detected MAP1LC3A proteins of
about 18 and 15 kD. Following fractionation of transfected HeLa cells,
the 15-kD form associated with the membrane pellet and the 18-kD form
associated with both the membrane and cytosolic fractions.

GENE FUNCTION

Rat Lc3 is processed into cytosolic and membrane-bound forms termed Lc3
I and Lc3 II, respectively. Kabeya et al. (2000) found that the
autophagic vacuole fraction prepared from starved rat liver was enriched
with Lc3 II. Immunoelectron microscopy revealed specific labeling of
autophagosome membrane in addition to cytoplasmic labeling. Lc3 II was
present both inside and outside autophagosomes. Mutation analysis
indicated that Lc3 I was formed by removal of the C-terminal 22 amino
acids from newly synthesized Lc3, leaving a C-terminal glyc120 residue.
A fraction of Lc3 I was then converted into Lc3 II. The amount of Lc3 II
produced correlated with the extent of autophagosome formation.

He et al. (2003) found that MAP1LC3A underwent C-terminal cleavage,
resulting in a protein with the conserved gly120 as its terminal
residue. Gly120 was required for posttranslational modification of
MAP1LC3A.

Behrends et al. (2010) reported a proteomic analysis of the autophagy
interaction network (AIN) in human cells under conditions of ongoing
(basal) autophagy, revealing a network of 751 interactions among 409
candidate interacting proteins with extensive connectivity among
subnetworks. Many new AIN components have roles in vesicle trafficking,
protein or lipid phosphorylation, and protein ubiquitination, and affect
autophagosome number or flux when depleted by RNA interference. The 6
human orthologs of yeast autophagy-8 (ATG8), MAP1LC3A, MAP1LC3B
(609604), MAP1LC3C (609605), GABARAP (605125), GABARAPL1 (607420), and
GABARAPL2 (607452), interact with a cohort of 67 proteins, with
extensive binding partner overlap between family members, and frequent
involvement of a conserved surface on ATG8 proteins known to interact
with LC3-interacting regions in partner proteins. Behrends et al. (2010)
concluded that their studies provided a global view of the mammalian
autophagy interaction landscape and a resource for mechanistic analysis
of this critical protein homeostasis pathway.

Choy et al. (2012) found that the intracellular pathogen Legionella
pneumophila could interfere with autophagy by using the bacterial
effector protein RavZ to directly uncouple Atg8 proteins attached to
phosphatidylethanolamine on autophagosome membranes. RavZ hydrolyzed the
amide bond between the carboxyl-terminal glycine residue and an adjacent
aromatic residue in Atg8 proteins, producing an Atg8 protein that could
not be reconjugated by Atg7 (see 608760) and Atg3 (see 609606). Thus,
Choy et al. (2012) concluded that intracellular pathogens can inhibit
autophagy by irreversibly inactivating Atg8 proteins during infection.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Microtubule-associated protein light chain-3, a mammalian homolog of
yeast Atg8, plays an essential role in autophagy, which is involved in
the bulk degradation of cytoplasmic components by the lysosomal system.
Sugawara et al. (2004) described the crystal structure of LC3 at
2.05-angstrom resolution; it has a ubiquitin fold at the C-terminal
region and 2 helices at the N-terminal region.

MAPPING

Mann and Hammarback (1996) mapped the LC3 gene to chromosome 20cen-q13
using a human/rodent hybrid cell mapping panel.

614301	TITLE *614301 ATAXIN 1-LIKE; ATXN1L
;;BROTHER OF ATAXIN 1; BOAT; BOAT1;;
BROTHER OF ATXN1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ATXN1 (601556) and ATXN1L are chromatin-binding factors that suppress
signaling within the Notch pathway (see 190198) in the absence of Notch
activation (Tong et al., 2011).

CLONING

By searching databases for proteins with ATXN1 and HBP1 (AXH) domains,
followed by RT-PCR of cerebellum mRNA, Mizutani et al. (2005) cloned
human ATXN1L, which they called BOAT. The deduced 689-amino acid protein
has an N-terminal BOAT and ATXN1 (NBA) domain and a C-terminal AXH
domain. Northern blot analysis detected variable expression of a
transcript of about 9 kb in all brain regions examined, with highest
expression in cerebellum and cerebral cortex. RNA dot blot analysis
revealed widespread BOAT expression. Immunohistochemical analysis
revealed similar expression patterns for Boat and Atxn1 in various
regions of mouse brain. Boat and Atxn1 were primarily expressed as
nuclear proteins in most brain cells, but they were also expressed in
cell bodies and dendrites in Purkinje cells and inferior olive cells.

MAPPING

Hartz (2011) mapped the ATXN1L gene to chromosome 16q22.2 based on an
alignment of the ATXN1L sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK025113) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Mizutani et al. (2005) showed that BOAT
interacted with itself and with ATXN1, and they confirmed the
interaction between BOAT and ATXN1 in human cell culture and Drosophila.
Truncation analysis showed that the NBA domain of BOAT mediated its
self-association and interaction with ATXN1, whereas the SAR and NBA
domains of ATXN1 mediated its self-association and interaction with
BOAT. Yeast 2-hybrid analysis revealed that BOAT also interacted with
SMRT (NCOR2; 600848), NCOR1 (600849), and the Drosophila SMRT ortholog,
Smrter. Truncation analysis showed that the AHX domain of BOAT mediated
its interactions with SMRT, NCOR1, and Smrter, and that the NBA domain
of BOAT also interacted with SMRT. Truncation analysis and reporter gene
assays revealed that ATXN1 contains a C-terminal transcriptional
repressive domain only, whereas BOAT contains independent N- and
C-terminal transcriptional repressive domains. Immunoprecipitation
analysis showed that endogenous BOAT, SMRT, and ATXN1 interacted in a
complex in HeLa cells. Overexpression of BOAT in MCF-7 cells caused
nuclear foci and altered the nuclear localization of endogenous SMRT and
HDAC3 (605166). Expression of ATXN1 with an SCA1 (164400)-associated
polyglutamine expansion (82Q) caused an abnormal eye phenotype in
Drosophila, and this phenotype was reversed by coexpression of BOAT.
SCA1 mice, which express human mutant ATXN1 in Purkinje cells, showed
reduced expression of Boat and Smrt compared with wildtype mice.
Mizutani et al. (2005) hypothesized that BOAT inhibits mutant ATXN1
toxicity by dimerizing with ATXN1 and reducing mutant ATXN1
self-association.

Notch signaling involves proteolytic release of the Notch intracellular
domain (NICD), followed by NICD-dependent gene activation. Tong et al.
(2011) found that expression of human BOAT1 in Drosophila wing disrupted
Notch signaling, leading to wing defects. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis
of HEK293 cells revealed that both BOAT1 and ATXN1 precipitated CBF1
(RBPJ; 147183), which functions as a transcriptional activator when
associated with NICD. Protein pull-down and yeast 2-hybrid analyses
confirmed the interactions and showed that BOAT1 and ATXN1 competed for
CBF1 binding. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that NICD
disrupted CBF1-BOAT/ATXN1 interactions. Reporter gene assays revealed
that both BOAT1 and ATXN1 inhibited CBF1 activity at the HEY1 (602953)
promoter. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that Boat1 and
Atxn1, in addition to Smrt, occupied the Hey1 promoter in
differentiating mouse C2C12 myoblasts. Atxn1 bound the Hey1 promoter
transiently, whereas Boat1 and Smrt remained bound to the Hey1 promoter
under the same conditions. Tong et al. (2011) concluded that BOAT1 and
ATXN1 are chromatin-binding factors that repress Notch signaling in the
absence of NCID by acting as CBF1 corepressors.

ANIMAL MODEL

Studies of the pathogenesis of SCA1 have supported a model in which the
expanded glutamine tract in the ATXN1 gene causes toxicity by modulating
the normal activities of that gene. To explore native interactions that
modify the toxicity of ATXN1, Bowman et al. (2007) generated a targeted
duplication of mouse Ataxn1l and tested the role of this protein in SCA1
pathology. Using a knockin mouse model of SCA1 that recapitulates the
selective neurodegeneration seen in affected individuals, Bowman et al.
(2007) found that elevated Atxn1l levels suppressed neuropathology by
displacing mutant Atxn1 from its native complex with Capicua (CIC;
612082). The results provided genetic evidence that the selective
neuropathology of SCA1 arises from modulation of a core functional
activity of ATXN1, and they underscored the importance of studying the
paralogs of genes mutated in neurodegenerative diseases to gain insight
into mechanisms of pathogenesis.

613114	TITLE *613114 FAMILY WITH SEQUENCE SIMILARITY 134, MEMBER B; FAM134B
;;JK1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching a region of chromosome 5p amplified in esophageal squamous
cell carcinoma (ESCC; see 133239) in a Chinese population, Tang et al.
(2007) identified FAM134B, which they called JK1. The deduced 39.3-kD
protein has an EGF (131530)-like domain, 3 N-glycosylation sites, 3
N-myristoylation sites, and numerous possible phosphorylation sites.

Kurth et al. (2009) stated that the human FAM134B protein contains 497
amino acids. Structure analysis showed that the N-terminal half of
FAM134B has 2 unusually long hydrophobic segments of about 35 amino
acids each that are separated by a hydrophilic loop of about 60 amino
acids. This structure is similar to that of reticulon proteins (see
600865) that shape the curvature of endoplasmic reticulum membranes. The
C terminus of FAM134B contains a coiled-coil domain. Northern blot
analysis of adult mouse tissues detected at least 4 Fam134b transcripts.
High expression of an approximately 1.5-kb transcript was detected in
testis only. Transcripts of about 3.5 kb were more weakly expressed in
dorsal root ganglia, esophagus, skeletal muscle, and kidney, and many
other tissues showed much weaker Fam134b expression. In situ
hybridization of day-14.5 mouse embryos showed prominent staining of
sensory and autonomic ganglia. In cultured mouse dorsal root ganglia,
Fam134b colocalized with a cis-Golgi marker and partly colocalized with
a trans-Golgi marker.

GENE FUNCTION

Using multiplex RT-PCR, Tang et al. (2007) found that JK1 was
overexpressed in a significant number of ESCC cell lines and tumors
compared with normal esophageal cells and tissues. Overexpression of JK1
in NIH-3T3 mouse fibroblasts and HEK293 cells caused an increase in
growth rate, colony formation in soft agar, and foci formation in
confluent cultures. High-grade sarcomas were formed in athymic nude mice
following subcutaneous injection of JK1-overexpressing NIH-3T3 cells.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Tang et al. (2007) mapped the FAM134B gene
to chromosome 5p15.1, downstream of the delta-catenin gene (CTNND2;
604275).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of 4 unrelated families with hereditary sensory and
autonomic neuropathy type IIB (HSAN2B; 613115), Kurth et al. (2009)
identified 4 different homozygous truncating loss-of-function mutations
in the FAM134B gene (613114.0001-613114.0004).

606886	TITLE *606886 RNA-BINDING MOTIF PROTEIN 6; RBM6
;;DEF3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Gure et al. (1998) identified RBM6, which they called NY-LU-12, by
immunoscreening a recombinant lung cancer cDNA expression library with
autologous patient serum. They cloned the full-length cDNA from normal
testis mRNA through a combination of 5-prime RACE and direct PCR. In
addition to the dominant transcript, they identified 3 minor forms that
contain additional exon(s). The deduced 1,123-amino acid major protein
contains 20 inexact 6-amino acid repeats close to the N terminus; 2
RNA-binding domains; 2 zinc finger motifs; a bipartite nuclear
localization signal; and a 4-residue nuclear localization pattern. They
noted that all of the predicted functional domains in RBM6 are also
present in RBM5 (606884), with which it shares 30% identity. Northern
blot analysis detected several RBM6 transcripts, ranging from
approximately 3 to 4.4 kb, in all tissues examined. Highest expression
was in liver, with intermediate expression in placenta, lung, skeletal
muscle, and kidney. Southern blot analysis showed no evidence of
homozygous deletion of RBM6 in tumor cell lines, the gene being
partially deleted in only 1 of 9 lung cancer cell lines.

Drabkin et al. (1999) isolated a cDNA encoding RBM6, which they called
DEF3, by positional cloning from a small cell lung carcinoma homozygous
deletion region on chromosome 3p21.3. The human and mouse RBM6 proteins
share 89% amino acid identity. Northern blot analysis indicated highest
expression in heart, intermediate levels in brain, placenta, liver,
skeletal muscle, and pancreas, and low expression in lung and kidney. In
hematopoietic tissues, highest expression was in lymph node and thymus,
with lower expression in bone marrow. Two bands were observed in
peripheral blood leukocytes and fetal liver. Northern blot analysis
showed constitutive expression of mouse Rbm6 during embryogenesis, as
well as expression in all adult mouse tissues examined.

Timmer et al. (1999) identified a YAC clone corresponding to chromosome
3p21.3 that is deleted in the small cell lung cancer cell line GLC20.
They isolated and cloned RBM6 by direct hybridization of this YAC clone
to a lung cDNA library. Northern blot analysis identified RBM6
transcripts of 4.7, 3.9, and 2.1 kb in all tissues tested. Although RBM6
maps to the critical region homozygously deleted in a small cell lung
carcinoma cell line, the authors found that the 5-prime end crosses the
telomeric breakpoint of the deletion. Northern and Southern analyses of
a number of lung cancer cell lines revealed no patterns of aberrant RBM6
expression.

GENE FUNCTION

Drabkin et al. (1999) found that recombinant proteins containing the RNA
recognition motifs of RBM5 or RBM6 specifically bind poly(G) RNA
homopolymers in vitro.

GENE STRUCTURE

Timmer et al. (1999) determined that the RBM6 gene contains 20 exons.

MAPPING

Timmer et al. (1999) identified the RBM5 gene within a YAC clone
corresponding to chromosome 3p21.3. By FISH, Heng et al. (2000) mapped
the mouse gene to chromosome 9F1-F2.

606944	TITLE *606944 ERBB2 INTERACTING PROTEIN; ERBB2IP
;;DENSIN-180-LIKE PROTEIN; ERBIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

In a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a mouse kidney cDNA library with the 9
C-terminal residues of Erbb2 (164870) as bait, Borg et al. (2000) cloned
Erbb2ip, which they called Erbin. They cloned human ERBB2IP by RT-PCR of
a human B-lymphocyte cell line. The deduced 1,371-amino acid protein
contains 16 canonical LRR (leucine-rich repeat) motifs at the N
terminus, followed by an LRR-like domain, proline-rich stretches that
may represent binding sites for SH3 and WW domains, and a C-terminal PDZ
domain. Northern blot analysis revealed a 7.2-kb transcript in most
human and mouse tissues. Western blot analysis indicated a 180-kD
doublet in all tissues tested.

Favre et al. (2001) cloned ERBB2IP in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a human
keratinocyte cDNA library with the N terminus of bullous pemphigoid
antigen-1 (BPAG1; 113810) as bait. They observed several splice
variants. ERBB2IP was expressed as a doublet of about 6.9 to 7.4 kb in
human keratinocytes and in a keratinocyte cell line. Semiquantitative
RT-PCR indicated numerous transcripts expressed in most tissues. Western
blot analysis showed a 200-kD in differentiated cells but not in
undifferentiated keratinocytes.

Huang et al. (2001) cloned Erbb2ip from mouse muscle, brain, and heart
cDNA libraries in a yeast 2-hybrid screen using Erbb2 as bait. Erbb2ip
was expressed as a 180-kD protein in brain, skeletal muscle, primary
muscle cultures, and muscle cell lines. Erbb2ip expression was found at
a similar level in myoblasts and myotubes, suggesting that expression is
not differentially regulated in muscle. By immunolocalization studies,
they colocalized Erbb2ip with the acetylcholine receptor at the
neuromuscular junction. Both Erbb2 and Erbb2ip were also found in
synaptosomes from adult mouse brain and copurified with postsynaptic
densities.

GENE FUNCTION

Using coimmunoprecipitation, mutation analysis, and GST pull-down
experiments, Borg et al. (2000) determined that ERBB2IP interacts with
nonactivated ERBB2 and that the interaction requires the PDZ domain of
ERBB2IP. They further showed by immunolocalization studies that the 2
proteins colocalize to the basolateral surface of polarized human colon
carcinoma cells and that mutation of the PDZ domain of ERBB2IP causes
mislocalization of ERBB2 in stably transfected canine kidney cells.

By mutation analysis and in vitro binding assays, Favre et al. (2001)
determined that ERBB2IP interacts specifically with BPAG1 and integrin
beta-4 (147557).

Huang et al. (2001) found that mouse Erbb2ip associates with Psd95
(602887). Mutation analysis indicated that the interaction is dependent
upon the PDZ domain of Psd95.

GENE STRUCTURE

Favre et al. (2001) determined that the ERBB2IP gene contains at least
26 exons. Sequence comparison of ERBB2IP variants indicated that the
variants are likely caused by alternate splicing between exons 21 and
26.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the ERBB2IP
gene to chromosome 5 (TMAP WI-31186). Favre et al. (2001) stated that
sequence analysis places the ERBB2IP gene on the long arm of chromosome
5 between D5S427 and D5S647.

158372	TITLE *158372 MUCIN 4, TRACHEOBRONCHIAL; MUC4
DESCRIPTION From a lambda-gt11 cDNA library constructed from human tracheobronchial
mucosa, Porchet et al. (1991) isolated a partial cDNA clone that reacted
with a polyclonal antiserum raised to chemically deglycosylated pronase
glycopeptides from human bronchial mucins. The novel tracheobronchial
mucin gene, referred to as mucin 4, was mapped to chromosome 3 by
analysis of somatic cell hybrids. By in situ hybridization, Van Cong et
al. (1991) mapped MUC4 to 3q29. They also demonstrated a VNTR
polymorphism useful for family linkage studies. The full report was
given by Gross et al. (1992). (Note that Nguyen Van Cong's name is
sometimes published as Nguyen, V. C. rather than Van Cong, N. Nguyen is
indeed the surname.)

Using real-time RT-PCR, Moehle et al. (2006) found that MUC4 was highly
expressed in adult trachea and colon, and in fetal lung. Expression was
moderate in adult testis, prostate, mammary gland, lung and stomach, and
weak in spinal cord, thymus, and salivary gland. No expression was
detected in other tissues examined.

;;T2R53;;
TASTE RECEPTOR, TYPE 2, MEMBER 44, FORMERLY; TAS2R44, FORMERLY
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TAS2R31 belongs to the large TAS2R receptor family. TAS2Rs are expressed
on the surface of taste receptor cells and mediate the perception of
bitterness through a G protein-coupled second messenger pathway (Conte
et al., 2002). For further information on TAS2Rs, see 604791.

CLONING

By screening the human genome for sequences related to TAS2Rs, Conte et
al. (2002) cloned TAS2R44, which they called T2R53. The deduced
309-amino acid protein contains the 7-transmembrane structure and short
N- and C-terminal domains conserved in TAS2Rs. The intracellular domains
share significant conservation with other TAS2R family members. TAS2R44
shares highest sequence similarity with TAS2R43 (612668).

By in situ hybridization, Kuhn et al. (2004) confirmed the presence of
TAS2R44 on human circumvallate papilla.

GENE FUNCTION

Using human embryonic kidney cells transfected with an experimental
construct that coupled activation of TAS2R43 or TAS2R44 to measurable
Ca(2+) release from intracellular stores, Kuhn et al. (2004) showed that
both receptors responded to a subset of bitter-tasting compounds. Both
receptors were activated by the sulfonyl amide sweeteners, saccharine
and acesulfame K, although TAS2R43 showed a weaker response. Both
receptors were highly sensitive to aristolochic acid, a purely
bitter-tasting compound, and neither was activated by compounds
eliciting sweet or umami taste. Consistent with the in vitro data,
cross-adaptation studies in human subjects supported the existence of
common receptors for both sulfonyl amide sweeteners. Kuhn et al. (2004)
concluded that TAS2R43 and TAS2R44 could contribute to the bitter
aftertaste of saccharine and acesulfame K.

Deshpande et al. (2010) found that bitter taste receptor agonists evoked
increased intracellular calcium in cultured human airway smooth muscle
(ASM) cells at levels comparable to GPCR agonists, such as bradykinin
and histamine. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis detected multiple TAS2R
transcripts in ASM cells, with highest expression of TAS2R10 (604791),
TAS2R14 (604790), and TAS2R31, intermediate expression of TAS2R5
(605062), TAS2R4 (604869), and TAS2R19 (613961), and detectable
expression of 11 other TAS2Rs, with results normalized for expression of
ADRB2 (109690). Expression of 8 other TAS2Rs and TAS1R1 (606225) and
TAS1R2 (606226) was undetectable. Using isolated intact mouse airways,
Deshpande et al. (2010) observed dose-dependent relaxation in response
to bitter taste receptor agonists, such as chloroquine, denatorium, and
quinine, after challenge with contracting agents, such as acetylcholine
or serotonin. Magnet twisting cytometry showed that isolated ASM cells
challenged with histamine relaxed after treatment with bitter taste
receptor agonists. Bitter taste receptor agonists were a more effective
treatment than albuterol in a mouse model of allergic airway
inflammation. Deshpande et al. (2010) proposed that agents that bind
bitter taste receptors and cause bronchodilation may provide an
alternative and/or supplement to beta agonist for the treatment of
asthma.

Brockhoff et al. (2010) found that exchanging 2 residues within
C-terminal transmembrane domain-7 of the related human taste receptors
TAS2R46 (612774), which is activated by strychnine, and TAS2R31, which
is activated by aristolochic acid, was sufficient to invert their
agonist selectivity. Transfer of functionally relevant amino acids in
TAS2R46 to the corresponding positions of TAS2R43 and TAS2R31 resulted
in pharmacologic properties indistinguishable from parental TAS2R46.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid and genomic sequence analysis, Conte et al.
(2002) mapped the TAS2R31 gene to a 1.2-Mb TAS2R gene cluster on
chromosome 12p.

604118	TITLE *604118 RAS PROTEIN ACTIVATOR-LIKE 1; RASAL1
;;RAS-GTPase-ACTIVATING PROTEIN-LIKE; RASAL;;
RASGAP1-LIKE
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The Ras superfamily of small GTPases plays an essential role in the
regulation of a wide variety of cellular signaling pathways. The GTPase
activity of these small GTPases is stimulated by GTPase-activating
proteins (GAPs), which results in the conversion of the GTPase from its
active GTP-bound form to its inactive GDP-bound form. By screening a
human frontal cortex cDNA library with a probe containing a GAP
consensus sequence, Allen et al. (1998) isolated cDNAs encoding a novel
RasGAP, which they called RASAL. The predicted 804-amino acid RASAL
protein is 87% identical to mouse Rasal, whose cDNAs were also isolated
by Allen et al. (1998). RASAL contains 2 N-terminal C2 domains, which
show similarity to the C2 regulatory region of protein kinase C (e.g.,
600448), a central conserved GAP-related domain, and a C-terminal
pleckstrin homology domain, all of which are characteristic of the GAP1
subfamily of RasGAP proteins. Northern blot analysis showed that human
RASAL is expressed as a 3- to 3.3-kb transcript in a limited number of
tissues, with the highest expression in adult brain, thyroid gland, and
adrenal gland. In situ hybridization detected mouse Rasal mRNA in the
follicular cells of the thyroid and within the medulla and zona
glomerulus of the adrenal gland.

Using RT-PCR, Jin et al. (2007) found that RASAL was expressed at
variable levels in almost all normal tissues examined.

GENE FUNCTION

Jin et al. (2007) stated that RASAL is a Ca(2+)-regulated GAP. By
examining gene expression databases, they found that RASAL expression
was downregulated in tumors of different origins, including brain, skin,
bladder, head, and neck. RT-PCR analysis showed significantly reduced
RASAL expression in multiple tumor cell lines, and methylation-specific
PCR revealed that RASAL downregulation was due to CpG methylation.
Expression of a catalytically active RASAL led to growth inhibition of
tumor cells by RAS inactivation.

Fibroblast activation during wound repair is spontaneously reversible,
whereas fibroblast activation associated with fibrosis is pathologically
perpetuated. Bechtel et al. (2010) found that the demethylating agent
5-prime azacytidine inhibited progressive fibrosis and kidney failure in
experimental kidney fibrosis in mice. In fibrotic human kidney
fibroblasts, in vitro 5-prime azacytidine normalized proliferation and
expression of type I collagen (see COL1A1; 120150) and alpha-smooth
muscle actin (ACTA2; 102620). A genomewide methylation screen identified
RASAL1 among 12 genes that were methylated in fibrotic primary human
fibroblasts and not in normal primary human fibroblasts. Bechtel et al.
(2010) noted that the promoter region of mouse Rasal1 has a CpG island
similar to that in the promoter region of human RASAL1. Using mouse
models of renal fibrosis, they showed that methylation of Rasal1 was
associated with repression of Rasal1 expression, and Rasal1 expression
inversely correlated with Ras hyperactivity. Inhibition of Ras activity
largely ameliorated renal fibrosis in the mouse model, as did
haploinsufficiency for DNA methyltransferase-1 (Dnmt1; 126375) in Dnmt1
+/- mice. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays confirmed that Dnmt1
bound Rasal1 DNA in fibrotic mouse kidneys, but not in normal control
kidneys. Bechtel et al. (2010) concluded that silencing of RASAL1
expression via promoter methylation contributes to renal fibrosis by
permitting RAS hyperactivation.

MAPPING

Allen et al. (1998) localized the RASAL1 gene to chromosome 12q23-q24 by
radiation hybrid mapping.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Mitochondria have their own translation system for production of 13
inner membrane proteins essential for oxidative phosphorylation. MRPS36
is a component of the small subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome that
is encoded by the nuclear genome (Koc et al., 2001).

CLONING

By proteolytic digestion of whole bovine 28S subunits, followed by
peptide analysis and EST database analysis, Koc et al. (2001) identified
full-length human MRPS36. The deduced 102-amino acid MRPS36 protein has
a calculated molecular mass of 11.3 kD. Koc et al. (2001) identified
MRPS36 orthologs in mouse, C. elegans, and yeast, but not in Drosophila
or E. coli. Mouse and human MRPS36 share 84.3% amino acid identity.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Zhang and Gerstein (2003) mapped the
MRPS36 gene to chromosome 5q12.1. They identified 6 MRPS36 pseudogenes
scattered throughout the genome.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Interstitial deletions of the short arm of chromosome 3 are found in a
large number of tumors. By comparative genomic hybridization, deletions
of 3p are frequently detected in breast, cervix, bladder, renal cell,
and small cell lung carcinomas. Microscopically detectable interstitial
deletions of 3p21 are found in a variety of tumors. Loss of
heterozygosity studies have shown frequent deletions of the 3p21.3
region in carcinomas of lung, kidney, head and neck, breast, and
bladder. Following up on these strong suggestions of the presence of 1
or more tumor suppressor genes on 3p, Szeles et al. (1997) used an
experimental system, the elimination test, to identify a 1-Mb segment,
referred to as the chromosome 3 common eliminated region-1, or C3CER1.
C3CER1 was also covered by a PAC contig. Using the sequence of 2
overlapping PACs from C3CER1, Kiss et al. (1999) localized the cDNA
encoding the precursor of mitochondrial leucyl-tRNA synthetase (LARS2;
604544). They also characterized a novel human LIM domain-containing
gene, LIMD1, and its mouse ortholog. LIM domains consist of a
cysteine-rich consensus sequence containing 2 distinct zinc-binding
subdomains, which mediate protein-protein interactions. The predicted
protein sequences of the human and mouse genes show 3 LIM domains
located at the C-terminal end, indicating that these genes belong to
group 3 of the gene family encoding the LIM motifs. The predicted human
LIMD1 protein contains 676 amino acids. Northern blot analysis indicated
that both the mouse and human genes are ubiquitously expressed, with
human LIMD1 being expressed predominantly as a 7.5-kb transcript. The
LIM motif had been previously identified in many developmentally
important factors from various eukaryotes. These factors had been shown
to play a role in intracellular signaling, transcriptional regulation,
and cellular differentiation during development. Thus, the
C3CER1-located LIMD1 gene deserves further study for its possible role
in tumor suppression.

By immunofluorescence microscopy of a human osteoblast cell line, Sharp
et al. (2004) localized LIMD1 predominantly to the cytoplasm, with
strongest staining in a punctate perinuclear distribution. Some LIMD1
localized to the nucleus, but not to nucleoli. Using a nuclear export
blocker, Sharp et al. (2004) showed that LIMD1 shuttles between the
cytoplasm and nucleus.

GENE FUNCTION

Sharp et al. (2004) found that LIMD1 specifically interacted with the
retinoblastoma protein (RB1; 614041) in HeLa cells, and the interaction
required amino acids 404 through 442, just prior to the 3 C-terminal LIM
domains. The interaction between LIMD1 and RB1 inhibited E2F (see E2F1;
189971)-mediated transcription and suppressed expression of a majority
of genes with E2F1-responsive elements. LIMD1 blocked tumor growth in
vitro and in vivo, and was downregulated in a majority of human lung
cancer samples examined.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kiss et al. (1999) characterized the genomic structure of the human
LIMD1 gene and found that the coding region of LIMD1 contains 8 exons.

MAPPING

By FISH, Kiss et al. (1999) mapped the LIMD1 gene to 3p21. They assigned
the mouse homolog to the chromosome 9F subtelomeric region using FISH.

612548	TITLE *612548 TRIPARTITE MOTIF-CONTAINING PROTEIN 50; TRIM50
;;TRIM50A
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching EST databases for sequences mapping to the region of
chromosome 7 deleted in Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS; 194050), followed
by 5-prime RACE, Micale et al. (2008) cloned TRIM50. The deduced
487-amino acid protein has an N-terminal RING domain, followed by a
B-box type-2 domain, a coiled-coil region, and an RFP (TRIM27;
602165)-like/B30.2 domain. Micale et al. (2008) also cloned mouse
Trim50, which encodes a protein 88% identical to human TRIM50. Northern
blot analysis of several mouse tissues detected high Trim50 expression
in stomach, much weaker expression in testis, and little to no
expression in other tissues examined. Ectopically expressed mouse Trim50
localized to discrete cytoplasmic foci that partly colocalized with
peroxisomes. Expression and mutation analyses revealed that the RING and
RFP domains of Trim50 include nuclear localization and export signals,
respectively. Crosslinking experiments showed Trim50 trimerized to form
a complex of about 250 kD by SDS-PAGE.

GENE FUNCTION

Micale et al. (2008) found that mouse Trim50 interacted with E2
ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes and autoubiquitinated following expression
in HEK293 cells. Immunoprecipitation and yeast 2-hybrid analyses showed
that Trim50 interacted preferentially with the E2 enzymes Ubch8 (UBE2L6;
603890), Ubch6 (UBE2E1; 602916), and Ubch9 (UBE2E3; 604151). Mutation
analysis showed that the RING domain of Trim50 was necessary and
sufficient for binding to E2 enzymes.

GENE STRUCTURE

Micale et al. (2008) determined that the TRIM50 gene contains 7 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Micale et al. (2008) mapped the TRIM50
gene to chromosome 7q11.23 within the interval deleted in WBS. They
mapped the mouse Trim50 gene to a syntenic region of chromosome 5G1.

613056	TITLE *613056 LUC7, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF, 2; LUC7L2
;;LUC7-LIKE 2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Howell et al. (2007) cloned Luc7l2 from an embryonic mouse cDNA library.
The deduced full-length Luc7l2 protein contains 392 amino acids and has
an N-terminal CCCH-type zinc finger, followed by a coiled-coil domain, a
C2H2-type zinc finger, an arginine- and glutamine-rich (RE) region, an
arginine- and serine-rich (RS) region, and a C-terminal arginine-rich
(R) region. It also has 3 nuclear localization signals in the RS region.
Howell et al. (2007) also identified Luc7l2 variants that used an
alternative polyadenylation site in intron 9, resulting in a truncated
335-amino acid protein lacking the C-terminal R region, as well as
variants exhibiting alternative splicing of exon 8, which removes the
5-prime end of the RS region. Northern blot analysis detected 2 major
transcripts in mouse brain, kidney, heart, thymus, stomach, skeletal
muscle, and testis. RT-PCR showed that all Luc7l2 variants were
ubiquitously expressed in mouse tissues. EST database analysis suggested
highest expression in lymph node, sympathetic ganglia, and midgestation
embryos. Fluorescence-tagged Luc7l2 was expressed in a speckled nuclear
pattern in transfected 293T cells.

GENE FUNCTION

The yeast ortholog of LUC7L2 is a spliceosomal protein involved in
recognition of nonconsensus splice donor sites. Using a yeast 2-hybrid
assay, Howell et al. (2007) showed that mouse Luc7l2 interacted with the
C terminus of Scnm1 (608095), a protein involved in splicing at
nonconsensus donor sites.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Howell et al. (2007) mapped the LUC7L2
gene to chromosome 7q34. They mapped the mouse Luc7l2 gene to a region
of chromosome 6 that shares homology of synteny with human chromosome
7q34.

602362	TITLE *602362 GTPase-ACTIVATING PROTEIN, RAN, 1; RANGAP1
;;RAN GTPase-ACTIVATING PROTEIN 1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

RAS-related small GTP-binding proteins (GTPBPs), such as RAN (601179),
participate in various intracellular signal transduction pathways. The
GTP-bound form usually represents the active signaling form of the
protein. Hydrolysis of GTP to GDP and phosphate occurs upon activation
of a latent GTPase activity in the GTPBP and returns it to its inactive,
GDP-bound state. This latent GTPase activity is induced upon interaction
of GTP-bound GTPBPs with GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). Bischoff et
al. (1994) purified a GAP from a HeLa cell extract. The protein,
designated RanGAP1, is a homodimeric 65-kD polypeptide. RanGAP1
specifically induced the GTPase activity of RAN, but not of RAS
(190020), by over 1,000-fold. Bischoff et al. (1994) believed RanGAP1 to
be the immediate antagonist of RCC1 (179710), a regulator molecule that
keeps RAN in the active, GTP-bound state.

Bischoff et al. (1995) purified the 65-kD RanGAP1 protein from human
HeLa cells. Using PCR with degenerate primers based on RanGAP1 peptide
sequences, they cloned the corresponding cDNA from a HeLa cell library.
The RANGAP1 gene encodes a 587-amino acid polypeptide. The sequence is
unrelated to that of GTPase activators for other RAS-related proteins,
but is 88% identical to Fug1, the murine homolog of yeast Rna1p.
Bischoff et al. (1995) proposed that RanGAP1 and RCC1 control
RAN-dependent transport between the nucleus and cytoplasm.

GENE FUNCTION

RAN is a nuclear RAS-like GTPase that is required for the bidirectional
transport of proteins and ribonucleoproteins across the nuclear pore
complex (NPC). RanGAP1 is a key regulator of the RAN GTP/GDP cycle.
Matunis et al. (1996) reported the identification and localization of a
novel form of RanGAP1. They showed that the 70-kD unmodified form of
RanGAP1 is exclusively cytoplasmic, whereas the 90-kD modified form is
associated with the cytoplasmic fibers of the NPC. The modified form
also appeared to associate with the mitotic spindle apparatus during
mitosis. These findings had specific implications for RAN function and
broad implications for protein regulation by ubiquitin-like
modifications.

RANGAP1 is modified by the conjugation of SUMO1 (601912), and this
modification is required for association of RANGAP1 with the nuclear
pore complex. Okuma et al. (1999) showed that human SUA1 (SAE1; 613294),
UBA2 (613295), and UBC9 (UBE2I; 601661) catalyzed in vitro sumoylation
of RANGAP1 in a 2-step reaction.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Seewald et al. (2002) presented the 3-dimensional structure of a
Ran-RanBP1-RanGAP ternary complex in the ground state and in a
transition-state mimic. The structure and biochemical experiments showed
that RanGAP does not act through an arginine finger, that the basic
machinery for fast GTP hydrolysis is provided exclusively by Ran, and
that correct positioning of the catalytic glutamine is essential for
catalysis.

Bernier-Villamor et al. (2002) performed crystallographic analysis of a
complex between mammalian UBC9 and a C-terminal domain of RANGAP1 at 2.5
angstroms. These experiments revealed structural determinants for
recognition of consensus SUMO modification sequences found within
SUMO-conjugated proteins. Structure-based mutagenesis and biochemical
analysis of UBC9 and RANGAP1 revealed distinct motifs required for
substrate binding and SUMO modification of p53 (191170), NFKBIA
(164008), and RANGAP1.

Reverter and Lima (2005) described the 3.0-angstrom crystal structure of
a 4-protein complex of UBC9, a NUP358/RANBP2 (601181) E3 ligase domain
(IR1-M), and SUMO1 conjugated to the carboxy-terminal domain of RANGAP1.
Structural insights, combined with biochemical and kinetic data obtained
with additional substrates, supported a model in which NUP358/RANBP2
acts as an E3 by binding both SUMO and UBC9 to position the
SUMO-E2-thioester in an optimal orientation to enhance conjugation.

609849	TITLE *609849 CORONIN 1B; CORO1B
;;CORONIN 2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the coronin family, such as CORO1B, are WD repeat-containing
actin-binding proteins that regulate cell motility (Cai et al., 2005).

CLONING

Okumura et al. (1998) cloned mouse Coro1b, which they called coronin-2,
and identified its human homolog by EST database analysis. Northern blot
analysis showed highest expression of mouse Cor1b in spleen, lung,
liver, and kidney.

Cai et al. (2005) cloned human CORO1B. The deduced 489-amino acid
protein contains WD40 repeats in its N-terminal half and a coiled-coil
region at its C terminus. Fluorescence-tagged CORO1B localized
predominantly to the leading edge of transfected fibroblasts, with some
localization along actin stress fibers.

GENE FUNCTION

Cai et al. (2005) found that CORO1B could homodimerize, but it did not
form complexes with other coronins. CORO1B was phosphorylated by protein
kinase C (PKC; see 176960) in vitro and in vivo. Using tryptic peptide
mapping and mutagenesis, Cai et al. (2005) identified ser2 as the major
CORO1B residue phosphorylated by PCK in vivo. Rat fibroblasts expressing
human CORO1B with a ser2-to-ala mutation showed enhanced ruffling in
response to phorbol esters and increased speed in single-cell tracking
assays. Cells expressing a constitutively active CORO1B mutant (ser2 to
asp) had attenuated ruffling and slower cell speed in response to
phorbol esters. CORO1B interacted with the ARP2/3 complex (604221), and
the interaction was regulated by PKC phosphorylation of CORO1B. Cai et
al. (2005) concluded that CORO1B regulates leading edge dynamics and
cell motility in fibroblasts and that its interaction with the ARP2/3
complex is regulated by PKC phosphorylation at ser2.

MAPPING

Hartz (2006) mapped the CORO1B gene to chromosome 11q13.2 based on an
alignment of the CORO1B sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK000860) with the
genomic sequence (build 35). Okumura et al. (1998) mapped the mouse
Coro1b gene to chromosome 19.

DESCRIPTION Molecules belonging to the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily function as
mediators of cell-cell interactions. The sialoadhesin family, a group of
sialic acid-binding proteins, is a subgroup of the Ig superfamily.
Members of the sialoadhesin family include myeloid antigen CD33
(159590). By sequencing cDNAs randomly selected from a human placenta
cDNA library, Takei et al. (1997) identified a partial cDNA with high
sequence similarity to CD33. Using the partial cDNA, they isolated
full-length placenta cDNAs. Since the predicted protein had significant
similarity to CD33, they called the corresponding gene 'CD33
antigen-like' (CD33L). The deduced 442-amino acid CD33L protein contains
a signal peptide, an N-terminal Ig-like V-domain, and 2 adjacent Ig
C2-like domains, followed by a transmembrane region and a cytoplasmic
tail. Based on its predicted structure, the authors stated that CD33L
belongs to the Ig superfamily and is likely a novel member of the
sialoadhesin subfamily. Takei et al. (1997) also isolated a cDNA likely
representing an alternatively spliced CD33L transcript; they called this
transcript CD33L2 and the aforementioned transcript CD33L1. Compared to
the original cDNA, this cDNA contains a 176-bp deletion in the coding
sequence, resulting in a predicted 342-amino acid protein lacking the
transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions. By RT-PCR of placenta RNA, the
authors detected both transcripts, although the transcript encoding the
membrane-bound isoform, CD33L1, was considerably more abundant. Northern
blot analysis of 16 adult tissues and 4 fetal tissues detected CD33L
expression only in the placenta; transcripts of 4 distinct sizes were
found, including 1 that was differentially polyadenylated.

Using an expression cloning strategy to identify molecules that bind to
leptin (164160), Patel et al. (1999) isolated a human erythroleukemic
cell line cDNA encoding OBBP1. They stated that OBBP1 is identical to
CD33L (Takei et al., 1997). The deduced 441-amino acid OBBP1 protein
shares 63% and 59% sequence identity with CD33 and OBBP2 (SIGLEC5;
604200), respectively. All 3 of these proteins have a cytoplasmic domain
containing putative sites of tyrosine phosphorylation, including an
immunoreceptor tyrosine kinase inhibitory motif and a motif found in
SLAM (603492) and SLAM-like proteins. In vitro studies with sialylated
ligands indicated that OBBP1 selectively bound to
Neu5Ac(alpha)2-6GalNAc(alpha), or sialyl-Tn, allowing its formal
designation as a SIGLEC (sialic acid-binding Ig-like lectin).
Recombinant OBBP1 exhibited tight and specific binding to leptin,
whereas OBBP2 and CD33 bound weakly to leptin. Northern blot analysis
detected high expression of OBBP1 mRNA in placenta, with moderate
expression in peripheral blood leukocytes, spleen, and small intestine.
Immunohistochemical analysis showed that OBBP1 is highly expressed in
the cyto- and syncytiotrophoblasts of the placenta. Flow cytometric
analysis on peripheral blood leukocytes found that OBBP1 is almost
exclusively expressed on B cells.

By FISH, Takei et al. (1997) mapped the SIGLEC6 gene to 19q13.3, which
is where the CD33 gene is located.

Nomenclature: The alternatively spliced transcript referred to as CD33L2
by Takei et al. (1997) is distinct from the CD33L2 gene (SIGLEC5;
604200).

;;ADENOSINE DEAMINASE, RNA-SPECIFIC, 2; ADAR2;;
RNA-EDITING ENZYME 1, RAT, HOMOLOG OF; RED1;;
RNA EDITASE 1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

RNA editing involves the deamination of adenosines at specific sites,
the result of which can be a change in the amino acid sequence of the
protein so that it differs from that predicted by the sequence of the
DNA. Editing of the glutamate receptor B (GluRB; 138247) pre-mRNA has
been shown to alter a codon (referred to as the Q/R site) for a channel
determinant that controls the calcium permeability of the AMPA glutamate
receptors. Melcher et al. (1996) tested the candidate dsRNA adenosine
deaminase DRADA (ADAR; 146920) and showed that when coexpressed with a
GluR-B minigene in HEK 293 cells, DRADA produced low-level editing at
the GluR-B Q/R site. The authors then screened a rat brain cDNA library
with the predicted catalytic domain of rat DRADA to identify other
potential editing enzymes. A cDNA encoding a predicted 711-amino acid
protein was isolated that gave about 90% of the expected activity in
their editing assay. Melcher et al. (1996) designated this novel
mammalian RNA editing protein RNA-editing enzyme-1 (RED1). Rat RED1 and
DRADA share about 31% overall identity primarily due to their
conservation in the C-terminal catalytic domain. Northern blots showed
highest expression of RED1 in rat brain. Melcher et al. (1996) further
observed that while RED1 was more efficient at deaminating some sites,
DRADA had stronger activity at others. They speculated that a
combination of these and perhaps other editing enzymes may be involved
in determining the overall editing process for a given transcript.

Mittaz et al. (1997) also cloned a human gene homologous to rat RED1.
The human gene, ADARB1, comprises 741 amino acids and contains 2
double-stranded RNA-binding domains in its N-terminal region. The
authors detected 2 transcripts of 8.8 and 4.2 kb that were strongly
expressed in brain and in many human adult and fetal tissues.

By searching for expressed sequence tags (ESTs) related to DRADA, Lai et
al. (1997) also isolated human cDNAs encoding ADARB1, which they
designated DRADA2. The DRADA2 gene is expressed ubiquitously in human
adult and fetal tissues. It has a complex transcription pattern, with 1
major 8.6-kb mRNA and several minor shorter mRNAs, some of which show
tissue specificity. Four DRADA2 isoforms, ranging in predicted size from
674 to 741 amino acids, result from alternative splicing. The isoforms
differ in their RNA editing capabilities in vitro.

GENE FUNCTION

The glutamate receptor subunit B pre-mRNA is edited at 2 adenosine
residues, resulting in amino acid changes that alter the
electrophysiologic properties of the glutamate receptor. These amino
acid changes are due to adenosine-to-inosine conversions in 2 codons
resulting from adenosine deamination. Yang et al. (1997) described the
purification and characterization of a human RNA adenosine deaminase
from HeLa cells that efficiently and accurately edits glutamate receptor
subunit B pre-mRNA at both of these sites. They concluded that the
activity reflects the human homolog of the RED1 protein, a member of the
family of double-stranded RNA-dependent deaminase proteins. O'Connell et
al. (1997) described the purification of a 90-kD protein identified as
human RED1. They showed that it edits the glutamine codon at position
586 in the pre-mRNA of the glutamate receptor B subunit.

GENE STRUCTURE

Villard et al. (1997) found that the ADARB1 gene spans approximately 25
kb and comprises 10 exons of coding sequence. The 2 RNA binding domains
are located within the 935-bp exon 2. An alternatively processed exon 6
potentially interrupts the catalytic domain. A survey of expression
patterns revealed differential processing of the 5- and 8.5-kb
transcripts in all sources examined. The difference in transcript size
appeared to result from alternative processing in the 3-prime
untranslated portion.

MAPPING

Mittaz et al. (1997) mapped the ADARB1 gene to 21q22.3 by YAC contig
analysis. See also ADARB2 (602065).

Using a cDNA fragment containing sequences homologous to the rat RED1
RNA editase gene, Villard et al. (1997) localized the human ADARB1 gene
to chromosome 21 by hybridization to a panel of somatic cell hybrids
containing subregions of 21q. This confirmed the location of RED1 in
distal 21q22.3.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Macbeth et al. (2005) reported the crystal structure of human ADAR2 at
1.7-angstrom resolution. The structure revealed a zinc ion in the active
site and suggested how the substrate adenosine is recognized.
Unexpectedly, inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) is buried within the
enzyme core, contributing to the protein fold. Although there are no
reports that adenosine deaminases that act on RNA (ADARs) require a
cofactor, Macbeth et al. (2005) showed that IP6 is required for
activity. Amino acids that coordinate IP6 in the crystal structure are
conserved in some adenosine deaminases that act on transfer RNA,
(ADATs), related enzymes that edit tRNA. Macbeth et al. (2005) showed
that IP6 is also essential for in vivo and in vitro deamination of
adenosine-37 of tRNA(alanine) (601431) by ADAT1 (604230).

ANIMAL MODEL

Higuchi et al. (2000) studied ADAR2-mediated RNA editing by generating
mice that were homozygous for a targeted functional null allele. Editing
in Adar2 -/- mice was substantially reduced at most of 25 positions in
diverse transcripts; the mutant mice became prone to seizures and died
young. The impaired phenotype appeared to result entirely from a single
underedited position, since it reverted to normal when both alleles for
the underedited transcript were substituted with alleles encoding the
edited version exonically. The critical position specifies an ion
channel determinant, the Q/R site, in AMPA receptor GluRB premessenger
RNA. Higuchi et al. (2000) concluded that this transcript is
physiologically the most important substrate of ADAR2.

DESCRIPTION See UBE2D1 (602961) for general information about ubiquitination and the
UBC4/5 subfamily of E2 enzymes.

CLONING

By PCR using degenerate oligonucleotides corresponding to conserved
regions of S. cerevisiae UBC5 and the related Drosophila UbcD1, Jensen
et al. (1995) identified a human peripheral blood lymphocyte cDNA
encoding UBCH5B, or UBE2D2. The predicted 147-amino acid UBCH5B and
UBCH5C (UBE2D3; 602963) proteins have only 4 amino acid differences, 3
of which are conservative changes; the nucleotide sequences of their
cDNAs are 87% identical within the coding region and 23% conserved
within the 3-prime untranslated region. The UBCH5B protein has 95%
sequence identity with the Drosophila UbcD1 protein, 93% identity with
C. elegans ubc2, 89% identity with human UBCH5A (UBE2D1), and 79%
identity with S. cerevisiae UBC4 and UBC5, and Arabidopsis thaliana UBC8
and UBC9. Recombinant UBCH5B expressed in E. coli had a molecular mass
of 16 kD by SDS-PAGE. Quantitative PCR detected UBCH5B expression in all
human tissues examined.

Independently, Rolfe et al. (1995) isolated a HeLa cell cDNA encoding
UBE2D2, which they called UBC4. Jensen et al. (1995) noted that the
coding sequences of this UBC4 cDNA and the UBCH5B cDNA isolated by them
have 3 nucleotide differences, 1 of which results in an amino acid
substitution.

GENE FUNCTION

Jensen et al. (1995) demonstrated that UBCH5B could conjugate ubiquitin
to target proteins in an E6AP (UBE3A; 601623)-dependent manner.

Rolfe et al. (1995) showed that UBC4 specifically ubiquitinated E6AP and
that in vivo inhibition of UBC4 led to inhibition of E6-stimulated p53
(TP53; 191170) degradation.

Kim et al. (2005) noted that the ubiquitin-conjugating (E2) enzyme
UBCH5B is part of a ubiquitin-ligating (E3) complex with CULLIN1 (CUL1;
603134), SKP1 (601434), ROC1 (RBX1; 603814), and BTRC (603482). By yeast
2-hybrid, coimmunoprecipitation, and Western blot analyses, Kim et al.
(2005) found that the Shigella flexneri effector protein OspG interacted
with a number of E2 enzymes, including UBCH5B. Transfection experiments
showed that OspG prevented phosphorylated IKBA (NFKBIA; 164008)
degradation and NFKB (164011) activation mediated by the
UBCH5B-containing E3 complex. Inactivation of OspG, on the other hand,
increased IKBA degradation in infected epithelial cells and increased
the inflammatory response in vivo. Kim et al. (2005) concluded that OspG
negatively controls the host innate immune response induced by S.
flexneri invasion of the epithelium.

603033	TITLE *603033 COLLAGENIC TAIL OF ENDPLATE ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE; COLQ
;;ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE-ASSOCIATED COLLAGEN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The COLQ gene encodes a collagen-like strand that associates into a
triple helix to form a tail that anchors catalytic subunits of
acetylcholinesterase (ACHE; 100740) to the basal lamina.

Asymmetric AChE is the major form of AChE at the endplate of the
neuromuscular junction in higher vertebrates. Asymmetric AChE is
composed of the T isoform of ACHE, ACHE(T), linked to a triple helical
COLQ tail. AChE rapidly hydrolyzes acetylcholine released at cholinergic
synapses in the nervous system, thus limiting the number of collisions
between ACh and the ACh receptor (AChR), and the duration of the
synaptic response (Ohno et al., 1998).

CLONING

Krejci et al. (1991) cloned ColQ from Torpedo. Krejci et al. (1997)
cloned the rat and mouse ColQ genes, and found that the ColQ subunits
form homotrimers and attach to AChE. Northern blot analysis detected
ColQ expression in cholinergic tissues, brain, muscle, and heart, as
well as in noncholinergic tissues such as lung and testes.

Ohno et al. (1998) used mouse ColQ primers to isolate human COLQ cDNA
from a human adult skeletal muscle cDNA library. The cDNA encodes a
deduced 455-amino acid protein with 89% homology to the rodent ColQ
peptide. Conserved domains include a secretion signal peptide, a
proline-rich attachment domain (PRAD) that interacts with AChE(T), 2
cysteines that form disulfide bonds with AChE(T), a collagen domain,
conserved cysteines that stabilize the tripal helical domain, and
proteoglycan binding domains that anchor the tripal helical domain to
the basal lamina. Several alternative transcripts were identified.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ohno et al. (1998) determined that the COLQ gene spans approximately 50
kb and comprises 17 constitutive exons and 2 alternatively transcribed
exons.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Ohno et al. (1998) mapped the
COLQ gene to chromosome 3p25. By radiation hybrid analysis, Donger et
al. (1998) mapped the COLQ gene to chromosome 3p24.2.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In patients with endplate AChE deficiency (EAD; 603034), Ohno et al.
(1998) identified 6 recessive mutations in the COLQ gene
(603033.0001-603033.0006). Coexpression of each of the 6 ColQ mutants
with wildtype AChE(T) in SV40-transformed monkey kidney fibroblast (COS)
cells showed that a mutation proximal to the ColQ attachment domain for
AChE(T) prevented association of ColQ with AChE(T); mutations distal to
the attachment domain generated a mutant species of acetylcholinesterase
composed of 1 AChE(T) tetramer and a truncated ColQ strand. The authors
concluded that the mutations prevented the insertion of the gene product
into the basal lamina.

In 6 sibs with a mild form of endplate AChE deficiency, Donger et al.
(1998) identified a homozygous mutation in the COLQ gene (603033.0007).

Shapira et al. (2002) reported 3 novel mutations in the COLQ gene in 8
patients with variable features of EAD: 1 patient was a compound
heterozygote; the other 7 patients, 6 Palestinian Arabs and 1 Iraqi Jew,
were all homozygous for a gly240-to-ter mutation (G240X; 603033.0010),
suggesting a founder mutation. Expression studies of the 3 mutations in
COS-7 cells showed that each prevented formation of insertion competent
asymmetric AChE.

ANIMAL MODEL

Feng et al. (1999) generated ColQ -/- mice to study the roles played by
ColQ and AChE in synapses and elsewhere. Such mice failed to thrive and
most died before reaching maturity. They completely lacked asymmetric
AChE in skeletal and cardiac muscles, specifically at the neuromuscular
junction and in the brain. Nonetheless, neuromuscular function was
present. A compensatory mechanism appeared to be a partial ensheathment
of nerve terminals by Schwann cells. Such mice also lacked the
asymmetric forms of Bche (177400). Surprisingly, globular AChE tetramers
were absent as well, suggesting a role for the ColQ gene in assembly or
stabilization of AChE forms that do not contain a collagenous subunit.

COLQ, 215-BP DEL, NT107

In a patient with endplate acetylcholinesterase deficiency (603034),
Ohno et al. (1998) found deletion of 215 basepairs following nucleotide
107 of the COLQ gene. The deletion was caused by skipping of exons 2 and
3, causing a frameshift after codon 35. The mutation abolished the
proline-rich attachment domain (PRAD) and predicted 25 missense codons
followed by a stop codon. The mutation was present in compound
heterozygous state with the E214X mutation (603033.0002). The deletion
mutation was inherited from the mother and the truncating mutation from
the father.

distal two-thirds of the collagen domain.

In a patient with EAD (603034), Ohno et al. (1998) identified compound
heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the COLQ gene: an arg282-to-ter
(R282X) mutation and a 1-bp deletion (1082delC). The R282X mutation
truncated COLQ 10 codons upstream to the C-terminal end of the collagen
domain. The 1-bp deletion caused a frameshift after codon 360,
predicting 64 missense codons followed by a stop codon; 1082delC spared
the entire collagen domain but abolished the C-terminal domain of COLQ.

In 6 affected sibs in a consanguineous Spanish family with EAD (603034),
Donger et al. (1998) identified a homozygous tyr431-to-ser (Y431S)
substitution in the conserved C-terminal domain of COLQ. The mutation
was predicted to disturb the attachment of collagen-tailed
acetylcholinesterase to the neuromuscular junction. Donger et al. (1998)
referred to the disorder in these patients as CMS Ic (for congenital
myasthenic syndrome type Ic). The authors noted that most previously
described CMS Ic patients had a marked decrease in total muscle
acetylcholinesterase with essentially no collagen-tailed forms. These
forms were present in affected members of the Spanish family but the
defect interfered with attachment to the neuromuscular junction.

and a splice donor site mutation at position +3 of intron 16 of COLQ
(603033.0009).

.0009
ENDPLATE ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE DEFICIENCY
COLQ, IVS16DS, A-G, +3

See 603033.0008 and Ohno et al. (1999). Using a minigene harboring the
COLQ IVS16+3A-G mutation for functional expression studies, Ohno et al.
(1999) found that the splice site mutation resulted in skipping of exon
16. The mutant splice donor site of intron 16 harbors 5 discordant
nucleotides (at -3, -2, +3, +4, and +6) that do not basepair with U1
small nuclear (sn) RNA (RNU1; 180680), the RNA responsible for splice
donor site recognition. Versions of the minigene harboring, at either +4
or +6, nucleotides complementary to U1 snRNA restored normal splicing.
Analysis of 1,801 native splice donor sites revealed that the presence
of a G nucleotide at +3 is associated with preferential usage, at
positions +4 to +6, of nucleotides concordant to U1 snRNA. Analysis of
11 disease-associated IVS+3A-G mutations indicated that, on average, 2
of 3 nucleotides at positions +4 to +6 failed to basepair, and that the
nucleotide at +4 never basepaired, with U1 snRNA. Ohno et al. (1999)
concluded that, with G at +3, normal splicing generally depends on the
concordance that residues at +4 to +6 have with U1 snRNA, but other
cis-acting elements may also be important in assuring the fidelity of
splicing.

In 6 Palestinian Arabs and 1 Iraqi Jew with variable features of EAD
(603034), Shapira et al. (2002) identified a homozygous 718G-T
transition in a splice acceptor consensus sequence of exon 12 of the
COLQ gene, resulting in a gly240-to-ter (G240X) mutation and causing
premature termination of the protein. The mutation prevented proper
formation of asymmetric AChE in COS-7 cells. The patients demonstrated
phenotypic variability, including differences in age of onset, disease
progression, respiratory and feeding difficulties, severity of weakness,
and ophthalmoplegia.

601511	TITLE *601511 SIGNAL TRANSDUCER AND ACTIVATOR OF TRANSCRIPTION 5A; STAT5A
;;SIGNAL TRANSDUCER AND ACTIVATOR OF TRANSCRIPTION 5; STAT5;;
MAMMARY GLAND FACTOR; MGF
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

STATs, such as STAT5, are proteins that serve the dual function of
signal transducers and activators of transcription in cells exposed to
signaling polypeptides. See STAT1 (600555), STAT2 (600556), STAT3
(102582), STAT4 (600558), and STAT6 (601512).

CLONING

Hou et al. (1995) cloned the human STAT5 cDNA from an umbilical vein
endothelial cell library and found that it encodes a 794-amino acid
polypeptide with a predicted mass of approximately 90.5 kD.

Darnell (1996) stated that 6 mouse and human STATs were known (7 if the
duplicated STAT5A and STAT5B (604260) genes are considered as 2) and at
least STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5 exhibit differentially spliced forms.

Ambrosio et al. (2002) cloned the human STAT5A gene. The deduced
794-amino acid protein has an N-terminal DNA-binding domain, followed by
a 4-helix bundle, a DNA-binding specificity domain, a connector region,
an SH2 domain, and a C-terminal transactivation domain. RT-PCR detected
STAT5A expression in all tissues and cell lines examined.

Wang et al. (1996) demonstrated that carboxy-truncated variant Stat5a
and Stat5b proteins of 77 and 80 kD, respectively, naturally occur in
mouse. These truncated Stat5a and Stat5b forms are derived from
incompletely spliced Stat5a and Stat5b transcripts.

By Northern blot analysis, Miyoshi et al. (2001) found that mouse Stat5a
is expressed at highest levels in liver and heart, followed by kidney.
Weaker expression was detected in most other tissues examined.

GENE FUNCTION

Darnell (1996) stated that more than 30 different polypeptides cause
STAT activation in various mammalian cells. The most potent activation
of STATs through the gp130-containing receptors is of STAT3 and by
sequence comparison the wildtype leptin receptor (601007) has potential
docking sites for STAT3 molecules. Darnell (1996) reflected on STAT3,
STAT5, and STAT6 as 'fat STATs,' i.e., the involvement of these 3 STATs,
but not STAT1, STAT2, and STAT4, in the physiologic action of leptin
(164160) as described by Ghilardi et al. (1996).

Hou et al. (1995) identified STAT5 as the protein most notably induced
in response to T-cell activation with IL2 147680. They hypothesized that
STAT5 may govern the effects of IL2 during the immune response.

Ihle and Kerr (1995) reviewed the activation cascade involving the
cytokines, the cytokine receptors (see IL2RA; 147730), the Janus kinases
(see JAK1; 147795), and the STATs.

Wang et al. (1996) showed that the truncated mouse Stat5a and Stat5b
proteins are inducibly tyrosine phosphorylated in the response to
several cytokines. These truncated Stat5 proteins form heterodimers with
both the full-length wildtype Stat5a and Stat5b proteins. Wang et al.
(1996) demonstrated that recombinant truncated forms of Stat5a and
Stat5b can be tyrosine phosphorylated and can bind to DNA. The tyrosine
phosphorylation of the carboxy-truncated forms was considerably more
stable than that of the wildtype Stat5a and Stat5b proteins.
Overexpression of a carboxy-truncated Stat5a protein in cells resulted
in the specific inhibition of the IL3 (147740)-induced transcriptional
activation of the oncostatin M gene (OSM; 165095) and the
cytokine-inducible SH2 domain-encoding gene (Cis), both of which have
been shown to be normally regulated by Stat5a. Although the truncated
Stat5a protein dominantly suppressed the induction of these genes, no
effects on cell proliferation were observed. Wang et al. (1996) stated
that their results demonstrate the natural existence of potential
dominantly suppressive variants of Stat5a and Stat5b, and implicate the
carboxyl domains of Stat5a and Stat5b proteins in transcriptional
regulation and functions related to dephosphorylation.

Boucheron et al. (1998) examined the DNA-binding domains of mouse Stat5a
and Stat5b and determined that the difference in their DNA-binding
specificities depends on a critical glycine residue in Stat5b and a
critical glutamic residue at a similar position in Stat5a.

To analyze the possible role of STAT5 in human GH-induced proliferation,
Friedrichsen et al. (2001) expressed a dominant-negative STAT5 mutant,
STAT5A-delta-749, in INS-1 cells under the control of a
doxycycline-inducible promoter by stable transfection. Two clones
exhibited dose-dependent, doxycycline-inducible expression of
STAT5A-delta-749 and suppression of GH-stimulated transcriptional
activation of a STAT5-regulated prolactin receptor (PRLR; 176761)
promoter-reporter construct. Furthermore, induction of STAT5A-delta-749
expression completely inhibited GH-induced DNA synthesis. Analysis of
endogenous gene expression revealed a doxycycline-dependent inhibition
of GH-stimulated PRLR and cyclin D2 (123833) mRNA levels. The authors
concluded that GH/prolactin-induced beta-cell proliferation is dependent
on the JAK2/STAT5 signaling pathway but not the MAPK, PI3K, and PKC
signaling pathways.

Zhang et al. (2007) stated that ALK (105590) tyrosine kinase expression
is normally confined to neural cells, but chromosomal translocations
involving ALK and various partners, most frequently nucleophosmin (NPM1;
164040), result in ectopic expression of ALK in a subset of T-cell
lymphomas (TCLs). The NPM1/ALK fusion protein contains the NPM1
oligomerization motif and the ALK catalytic domain, is constitutively
activated through autophosphorylation, and mediates malignant cell
transformation in vitro and in vivo by activating downstream effectors,
including STAT3. Zhang et al. (2007) found that TCL cell lines
expressing NPM1/ALK expressed STAT5B, but not STAT5A, protein, whereas
normal resting and activated T cells from peripheral blood and
ALK-negative TCL cell lines expressed STAT5A protein. Activated
NPM1/ALK-positive TCL cell lines also did not express STAT5A mRNA, in
spite of having an intact STAT5A gene. Analysis of the CpG island in the
STAT5A promoter showed that the region was methylated in
NPM1/ALK-positive, but not NPM1/ALK-negative, T cells. Chromatin
immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that SP1 (189906) bound the STAT5A
promoter in normal activated T cells, whereas MECP2 (300005) bound the
promoter of NPM1/ALK-positive TCL cells. Demethylation of the promoter
resulted in STAT5A activation and inhibition of NPM1/ALK expression by
binding of STAT5A to the NPM1/ALK fusion gene. Expression of NPM1/ALK in
NPM1/ALK-negative TCL cells resulted in silencing of STAT5A in a
STAT3-dependent manner, whereas small interfering RNA mediated-depletion
of NPM1/ALK resulted in STAT5A expression. Zhang et al. (2007) concluded
that NPM1/ALK induces epigenetic silencing of the STAT5A gene and that
the STAT5A protein can act as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting NPM1/ALK
expression.

Using an inducible promoter, Fatrai et al. (2011) showed that
overexpression of STAT5 provided a proliferative advantage for neonatal
human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), but not stem cell progenitors.
Expression profiling identified HIF2A (EPAS1; 603349) among 32 genes
that were upregulated by STAT5 overexpression, and HIF2A upregulation
was independent of hypoxia. Knockdown of HIF2A in HSCs abrogated the
effects of STAT5 on long-term proliferation and self-renewal. HIF2A had
no effect on HSC differentiation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis
confirmed direct binding of STAT5 to the HIF2A promoter 344 bp upstream
of the HIF2A start site. STAT5 overexpression independently resulted in
erythroid commitment in megakaryocytic-erythroid progenitors, which was
abrogated by knockdown of GATA1 (305371). STAT5 also induced glucose
uptake in HSC and progenitor cells via upregulation of the glucose
transporters GLUT1 (SLC2A1; 138140) and GLUT3 (SLC2A3; 138170).

GENE STRUCTURE

Ambrosio et al. (2002) determined that the STAT5A gene contains 20
exons. A CpG island covers exon 2, and exon 3 contains the ATG start
codon.

Miyoshi et al. (2001) determined that the mouse Stat5a gene contains 20
exons and spans 30 kb. The translation initiation codon is in exon 3,
and the stop codon is in exon 20. The mouse Stat5a gene contains a
single promoter.

Crispi et al. (2004) determined that both the STAT5A and STAT5B genes
lack TATA and CAAT elements, but both have binding sites for
transcription factors common in TATA-less promoters. Using a reporter
assay, they determined that gene fragments containing the CpG islands
were the most transcriptionally active fragments. Sp1 (189906) enhanced
expression of the basal promoters, and DNA methylation interfered with
Sp1-induced transcription. Cross-species sequence comparison identified
a bidirectional negative cis-acting regulatory element in the STAT5
intergenic region.

MAPPING

By FISH, Lin et al. (1996) mapped the STAT5A and STAT5B genes to
chromosome 17q11.2. Ambrosio et al. (2002) determined that the STAT5A
and STAT5B genes are in an inverted orientation, with their 5-prime ends
about 11 kb apart.

Miyoshi et al. (2001) mapped the mouse Stat5a gene to chromosome 11. The
promoters of the Stat5a and Stat5b genes are located head to head and
are separated by 10 kb. The Stat5a and Stat3 genes are located next to
each other in a tail-to-tail orientation with their polyadenylation
sites 3 kb apart. The order and orientation of genes at this locus, Ptrf
(603189)--Stat3--Stat5a--Stat5b--Lgp1 (608587)--Hcrt (602358), are
identical in the syntenic region of human chromosome 17q21.

ANIMAL MODEL

Socolovsky et al. (1999) studied Stat5a -/- 5b -/- mice during fetal
development, a time of rapid growth and little reserve capacity in the
erythropoietic system. They found that Stat5a -/- 5b -/- embryos were
severely anemic; Stat5a -/- 5b -/- fetal liver erythroid progenitors
gave rise to fewer erythroid colonies in vitro and showed a marked
increase in their rate of apoptosis. These findings were explained by a
crucial role for STAT5 in erythropoietin receptor (EPOR; 133171)
antiapoptotic signaling: STAT5 is responsible for the immediate-early
induction of the long isoform of the BCL2-related protein (BCLX; 600039)
in erythroid cells through direct binding to the promoter of the BCLX
gene. This antiapoptotic pathway linking STAT5 activation with direct
transcriptional regulation of BCLX suggested a general mechanism whereby
STAT proteins may modulate the apoptotic program within the cell, and
demonstrated an essential role for STAT5 in cytokine receptor-mediated
homeostatic control of the hematopoietic system.

STAT5 is activated in a broad spectrum of human hematologic
malignancies. Using a genetic approach, Schwaller et al. (2000)
addressed whether activation of STAT5 is necessary for the myelo- and
lymphoproliferative disease induced by the TEL (600618)/JAK2 (147796)
fusion gene. Whereas mice transplanted with bone marrow transduced with
retrovirus expressing TEL/JAK2 developed a rapidly fatal myelo- and
lymphoproliferative syndrome, reconstitution with bone marrow derived
from Stat5a/b-deficient mice expressing TEL/JAK2 did not induce disease.
Disease induction in the Stat5a/b-deficient background was rescued with
a bicistronic retrovirus encoding TEL/JAK2 and Stat5a. Furthermore,
myeloproliferative disease was induced by reconstitution with bone
marrow cells expressing a constitutively active mutant, Stat5a, or a
single Stat5a target, murine Osm. These data defined a critical role for
STAT5A/B and OSM in the pathogenesis of TEL/JAK2 disease.

Snow et al. (2003) observed that a subset of mice deficient in both
Stat5a and Stat5b had dramatic alterations in several bone marrow
progenitor populations, along with cellular infiltration of colon,
liver, and kidney and early death. The pathology and increased mortality
in these mice were abrogated when Rag1 (179615) was also deleted. The
phenotype was similar to that in mice defective in Il2 signaling and
correlated with a reduction in the number of Cd4 (186940)-positive/Cd25
(IL2RA)-positive regulatory T cells. Snow et al. (2003) concluded that
STAT5 is critical for maintenance of tolerance in vivo and that STAT5 is
probably activated by IL2R.

Tronche et al. (2004) found that mice with targeted disruption of Gccr
(138040) in hepatocytes showed dramatically reduced body size due to
impaired Stat5-dependent growth hormone signaling. Mice with a mutant
Gccr deficient in DNA binding but still able to interact with Stat5
showed normal body size and normal levels of Stat5-dependent
transcription. Tronche et al. (2004) concluded that GCCR acts as a
coactivator for STAT5-dependent transcription upon growth hormone
stimulation.

Cui et al. (2004) conditionally deleted the 110-kb Stat5 locus, which
spans both the Stat5a and Stat5b genes, to study the functions of the
Stat5 genes during mouse mammary gland development. Loss of the Stat5
genes prior to pregnancy prevented epithelial proliferation and
differentiation. Deletion of Stat5 during pregnancy, after mammary
epithelium had entered Stat5-mediated differentiation, resulted in
premature cell death, indicating that mammary epithelial cell
proliferation, differentiation, and survival require Stat5.

Yao et al. (2006) compared mice with a complete deletion of Stat5a and
Stat5b (Stat5 -/-) with mice having an N-terminally truncated, partially
functional Stat5 protein (Stat5delN) and mice lacking Il7r (146661),
Jak3 (600173), or the common gamma chain, Il2rg (308380). Stat5 -/- mice
died before or shortly after birth. Examination of day-18.5 Stat5 -/-
embryos showed a severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID; see 601457)
phenotype with significantly fewer thymocytes and splenocytes than
wildtype controls. The thymocyte deficit in Stat5 -/- embryos was
similar in magnitude to that in Il7r- or Il2rg-deficient embryos,
whereas Stat5delN embryos had significantly more thymocytes. The
splenocyte reduction in Stat5 -/- embryos was more severe than that in
Il7r- or IL2rg-deficient mice. B-cell proportions were particularly low
in Stat5 -/- embryos compared with controls, similar to Il7r -/- mice.
Tcra (see 186880) and Tcrb (see 186930) rearrangement was normal in
Stat5 -/- mice, but Tcrg (see 186970) rearrangement was defective. As in
Jak3 -/- mice, there was a marked reduction in CD8-positive T cells. Yao
et al. (2006) concluded that STAT5 deficiency results in SCID, similar
in many respects to what occurs in IL7R, JAK3, or IL2RG deficiency.

157132	TITLE *157132 MICROTUBULE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 4; MAP4
DESCRIPTION Chapin and Bulinski (1991) used a polyclonal antiserum raised against a
HeLa cell microtubule-associated protein of M(r) 210,000 (210-kD MAP or
MAP4), an abundant nonneuronal MAP, to isolate cDNA clones from a human
fetal brain lambda gt11 cDNA expression library. They found that this,
the major human nonneuronal MAP, resembles 2 neuronal MAPs in its
microtubule-binding domain, while most of the molecule has sequences,
and presumably functions, distinct from those of the neuronal MAPs
(e.g., 157130).

West et al. (1991) reported the structure of MAP4 on the basis of
comparisons of the human, mouse, and bovine sequences.

Chapin et al. (1995) isolated clones encoding alternatively spliced
forms of MAP4. One isoform is similar to an isoform of tau (157140) in
structure. The authors mapped human MAP4 gene to 3p21 by fluorescence in
situ hybridization. Mangan and Olmsted (1996) demonstrated that the
murine homolog is located on mouse chromosome 9.

124050	TITLE *124050 D-AMINO ACID OXIDASE; DAO
;;DAMOX;;
DAAO
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The DAO gene encodes D-amino acid oxidase (EC 1.4.3.3), one of the
principal and characteristic flavoenzymes of peroxisomes found in the
liver, kidney, and brain of many mammalian species. DAO has a flavin
adenine dinucleotide (FAD) as the prosthetic group and catalyzes the
oxidative deamination of a wide range of D-amino acids but is inactive
on naturally occurring L-amino acids (summary by Barker and Hopkinson,
1977).

CLONING

Fukui and Miyake (1992) isolated genomic clones for the entire DAO gene
from human placental genomic libraries, with the aid of a previously
cloned cDNA with human DAO as a probe. The 347-amino acid protein has a
molecular mass of 39.4 kD. They noted that DAO has been intracellularly
localized to peroxisomes.

Mitchell et al. (2010) found expression of the DAO gene in gray matter
of the spinal cord and cerebellum, including motor neurons and Purkinje
cells, respectively. DAO was also expressed in glial cells but not in
the motor cortex. DAO contains FAD binding and dimer interaction
domains, as well as a TrkA potassium uptake signature, an aminoacyl-tRNA
synthetase class I signature, and a D-amino acid oxidase signature.

GENE STRUCTURE

Fukui and Miyake (1992) determined that the DAO gene contains 11 exons
and spans 20 kb.

MAPPING

With the use of genomic DNAs prepared from human/Chinese hamster somatic
hybrid cells as templates for PCR, Fukui and Miyake (1992) localized the
DAO gene to human chromosome 12.

The DAO gene maps to chromosome 12q24 (Mitchell et al., 2010).

GENE FUNCTION

Barker and Hopkinson (1977) found neither polymorphisms nor rare genetic
variants of the DAO gene, which they abbreviated DAMOX. The biologic
role of DAO and DDO (124450) has been thought to be protection against
L-amino acids of fungi, bacteria and insects, or contribution to
acid-base balance in the kidney. Alternatively, they may be merely
fossil enzymes, i.e., relics of our evolutionary past.

DAAO is expressed in human brain, where it oxidizes D-serine, a potent
activator of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-type glutamate receptor (see
602717). Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Chumakov et al. (2002)
identified DAAO as an interacting partner of the G72 protein (607408).
The interaction between G72 and DAAO was confirmed in vitro and shown to
result in activation of DAAO.

Molla et al. (2006) characterized recombinant human DAAO expressed in E.
coli. The recombinant protein was catalytically active and converted the
oxidized form of the FAD cofactor to the reduced state following
addition of D-alanine under anaerobic conditions. Gel permeation
chromatography revealed that native DAAO was a dimer in solution, and
each monomer noncovalently bound FAD. DAAO showed higher catalytic
efficiency and substrate affinity toward D-alanine and D-proline than
D-serine. It also oxidized D-aspartate and glycine, but it had low
affinity for these substrates. Steady-state and presteady-state
measurements indicated that DAAO followed a sequential kinetic
mechanism.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Association With Schizophrenia

Chumakov et al. (2002) found 4 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
markers from DAAO that were associated with schizophrenia (181500) in
the same Canadian case/control samples that led to the identification of
G72. Logistic regression revealed genetic interaction between associated
SNPs in the vicinity of 2 genes. Chumakov et al. (2002) concluded that
association of both DAAO and G72 with schizophrenia, together with
activation of DAAO by a G72 protein product, pointed to the involvement
of this N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor regulation pathway in
schizophrenia.

- Possible Association With Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis

In a 3-generation kindred with familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
(ALS; 105400), Mitchell et al. (2010) found linkage to markers D12S1646
and D12S354 on chromosome 12q24 (2-point lod score of 2.7). Screening of
candidate genes identified a heterozygous arg199-to-trp (R199W) mutation
in exon 7 of the DAO gene in 3 affected members and in 1 obligate
carrier who died at age 73 years of cardiac failure and reportedly had
right-sided weakness and dysarthria. The proband had onset at age 40,
and the mean age at death in 7 cases was 44 years (range, 42 to 55
years). The R199W mutation was also present in 3 at-risk individuals of
33, 44, and 48 years of age, respectively. Arg199 is highly conserved
between mammalian and lower organisms such as yeast, fungi, and
bacteria, and lies close to the FAD-binding site. The mutation was not
found in 780 Caucasian controls. Postmortem examination of the obligate
carrier showed some loss of motor neurons in the spinal cord and
degeneration of 1 of the lateral corticospinal tracts. There was
markedly decreased DAO enzyme activity in the spinal cord compared to
controls. Coexpression of mutant protein with wildtype protein in COS-7
cells indicated a dominant-negative effect of the mutant protein. Rat
neuronal cell lines expressing mutant protein showed decreased viability
and increased ubiquitinated aggregates compared to wildtype. A
pathogenic role for the accumulation of D-serine was postulated.
Mitchell et al. (2010) suggested a role for the DAO gene in ALS but
noted that a causal role for the R199W-mutant protein remained to be
unequivocally established.

Millecamps et al. (2010) sequenced the DAO gene in 126 unrelated French
patients with familial ALS and identified a heterozygous arg38-to-his
(R38H) variant in exon 2 in a mother and daughter with classic
adult-onset ALS. The variant was also found in 1 of 1,016 control
chromosomes, indicating that it is a rare polymorphism. They did not
find the R199W variant in their patients. Millecamps et al. (2010)
stated that their data neither confirmed nor excluded the possibility
that DAO mutations may be associated with ALS in rare families. In a
reply, de Belleroche and Morris (2010) noted that the data reported by
Millecamps et al. (2010) should not alter the interpretation of their
previous findings (Mitchell et al., 2010), which showed that the R199W
mutation segregated with disease, promoted formation of ubiquitinated
protein aggregates, and reduced motor neuron survival.

ANIMAL MODEL

Inhibition or disruption of Dao leads to increased levels of D-serine in
the mouse brain, serum, and spinal cord, and is associated with
increased NMDA-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents. Zhang et al.
(2011) found that Dao-null mice had enhanced prepulse inhibition (PPI)
compared to controls. When treated with a competitive NMDA antagonist,
the mutant mice had increased sensitivity to the PPI-disruptive effect.
Mutant mice also showed increased learning and exploratory behavior that
was not related to anxiety. The findings suggested that Dao-null mice
might have altered functioning of NMDA receptors due to increased
amounts of D-serine, but there was only modest support for manipulations
of DAO activity as a potential therapeutic approach to treat
schizophrenia.

600871	TITLE *600871 GROWTH FACTOR-INDEPENDENT 1; GFI1
;;ZNF163
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

GFI1 is a transcriptional repressor that is transiently induced during
T-cell differentiation. GFI1 plays critical roles in enhancing T
helper-2 (Th2) cell expansion and in repressing induction of Th17 (see
IL17A; 603149) and CD103 (ITGAE; 604682)-positive inducible regulatory T
(Treg) cells (Zhu et al., 2009).

CLONING

Rat T-cell lymphomas induced by Moloney murine leukemia virus (Mo-MuLV)
are dependent upon interleukin-2 (IL2; 147680) for growth in cell
culture. Gilks et al. (1993) grew Mo-MuLV-induced rat T-cell lymphoma
lines in IL-2-free medium in order to select for IL2-independent
mutants. Following selection for an IL2-independent phenotype, they
cloned a full-length cDNA of the gene, symbolized Gfi1 for 'growth
factor independence-1.' They speculated that the GFI1 protein may be
involved in events occurring after the interaction of IL-2 with its
receptor. Indeed, the GFI1 protein may regulate the expression of genes
during S phase of the cell cycle in T cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Nolo et al. (2000) identified and characterized the Drosophila
'senseless' (sens) protein, which shares homology with the human GFI1
protein. They found that the sens gene is required for proper
development of most cell types of the embryonic and adult peripheral
nervous system (PNS) of Drosophila. Sens is a nuclear protein with 4
zinc fingers that is expressed and required in the sensory organ
precursors (SOP) for proper proneural gene expression. It shares 87%
amino acid identity with the GFI1 protein in the zinc finger domains.
Ectopic expression of Sens in many ectodermal cells caused induction of
PNS external sensory organ formation and was able to recreate an ectopic
proneural field. Hence, sens is both necessary and sufficient for PNS
development. These data indicated that proneural genes activate sens
expression. Sens is then in turn required to further activate and
maintain proneural gene expression. This feedback mechanism is essential
for selective enhancement and maintenance of proneural gene expression
in the SOPs in Drosophila.

Liu and Cowell (2000) cloned and characterized the human GFI1 promoter.
They found that its nucleotide sequence is GC-rich and does not contain
a typical TATA or CAAT box. Computer predictions indicated that either
of 2 Sp1 sites might serve as the site for transcription initiation.

Using microarray analysis of IL4 (147780)-stimulated and unstimulated
mouse Cd4 T cells, Zhu et al. (2002) identified Gfi1, a Stat6
(601512)-dependent transcriptional repressor, as a strongly induced
immediate-early gene that promoted proliferation of Th2 cells during
their polarization. Prolongation of Gfi1 expression by retroviral
infection resulted in enhanced Il2 (147680)-induced Stat5 (STAT5A;
601511) phosphorylation and repressed p27(Kip1) (CDKN1B; 600778)
expression, as well as greater proliferation. Zhu et al. (2002)
concluded that GFI1, in cooperation with GATA3 (131320), plays a major
role in IL4-driven CD4 T-cell proliferation.

As indicated later, Gfi1-deficient mice, produced by gene targeting, are
neutropenic. Furthermore, Person et al. (2003) demonstrated that
heritable GFI1 mutations cause human neutropenia. Mutant GFI1 in these
cases fails to repress ELA2 (130130), encoding neutrophil elastase,
mutations of which are the major cause of inherited human neutropenia
syndromes. In both mice and humans with GFI1 mutations, myeloid
progenitor cells fail to differentiate to mature neutrophils, causing
the accumulation of monocytes and abnormal cells that blend features of
monocytes and granulocytes. Only 1 cellular promoter had been known to
be repressed by GFI1, that for the antiapoptotic factor BAX (600040). To
identify genes regulated by GFI1 during hematopoiesis in vivo, Duan and
Horwitz (2003) performed large-scale chromatin immunoprecipitation
(ChIP) assays. They found that GFI1 binds to a functionally diverse set
of genes acting concertedly during hematopoietic differentiation.

Hock et al. (2004) reported that GFI1 restricted proliferation of
hematopoietic stem cells. After loss of GFI1, hematopoietic stem cells
displayed elevated proliferation rates as assessed by
5-bromodeoxyuridine incorporation and cell cycle analysis. Gfi1 null
hematopoietic stem cells were functionally compromised in competitive
repopulation and serial transplantation assays and were rapidly
outcompeted in the bone marrow of mouse chimeras generated with Gfi1
null embryonic stem cells. Hock et al. (2004) concluded that GFI1 is
essential to restrict hematopoietic stem cell proliferation and to
preserve functional integrity.

Using mouse mutants, Zeng et al. (2004) showed that Gfi1 was
differentially expressed in hematopoietic stem cells and subsets of
hematopoietic progenitor cells, and that loss of Gfi1 resulted in
significant alteration of stem and precursor cell frequencies.
Functional assays showed that Gfi1 maintained hematopoietic stem cell
self-renewal, multilineage differentiation, and efficient reconstitution
of hematopoiesis in transplanted hosts by restricting stem cell
proliferation.

By coimmunoprecipitation assays with mouse and human cells, Saleque et
al. (2007) showed that LSD1 (AOF2; 609132), COREST (RCOR; 607675), HDAC1
(601241), and HDAC2 (605164) interacted with both GFI1 and GFI1B
(604383) in endogenous complexes. The N-terminal SNAG repression domain
of GFI1 and GFI1B was required for their association with COREST and
LSD1. Mouse Gfi1b recruited these cofactors to the majority of target
gene promoters in vivo. Inhibition of Corest and Lsd1 perturbed
differentiation of mouse erythroid, megakaryocytic, and granulocytic
cells, as well as primary erythroid progenitors. Lsd1 depletion
derepressed GFI targets in lineage-specific patterns, accompanied by
enhanced histone-3 (see 602810) lys4 methylation at the respective
promoters. Saleque et al. (2007) concluded that GFI complexes catalyze
serial histone modification of their targets, leading to their graded
silencing.

MAPPING

Bell et al. (1995) mapped the GFI1 gene to mouse chromosome 5 by linkage
analysis and mapped the GFI1 gene to rat chromosome 14p22 and to human
chromosome 1p22 by fluorescence in situ hybridization. The assignment to
chromosome 1 was confirmed using a mapping-panel blot.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Mice lacking the transcriptional repressor oncoprotein Gfi1 are
unexpectedly neutropenic (Karsunky et al., 2002; Hock et al., 2003).
Person et al. (2003) screened GFI1 as a candidate for association with
neutropenia in individuals without mutations in ELA2 (130130), the most
common cause of autosomal dominant severe congenital neutropenia (SCN1;
202700). They found dominant-negative zinc finger mutations that
disabled transcriptional repressor activity. The phenotype also included
immunodeficient lymphocytes and production of a circulating population
of myeloid cells that appeared immature. They showed by chromatin
immunoprecipitation, gel shift, reporter assays, and elevated expression
of ELA2 in vivo in neutropenic individuals that GFI1 represses ELA2,
thus linking these 2 genes in a common pathway involved in myeloid
differentiation. The 2 amino acid substitutions found in cases of
neutropenia by Person et al. (2003) involved amino acids identical in
Gfi1 homologs in divergent species and also conserved in the paralog
GFI1B. One of the mutations was found in individuals with SCN2 (613107),
and the other mutation was found in an individual with nonimmune chronic
idiopathic neutropenia of adults (607847).

ANIMAL MODEL

Karsunky et al. (2002) found that Gfi1 is expressed outside the lymphoid
system in granulocytes and activated macrophages, cells that mediate
innate immunity (i.e., nonspecific immunity). They generated
Gfi1-deficient mice (Gfi1 -/-) and showed that these animals are
severely neutropenic and accumulate immature monocytic cells in blood
and bone marrow. Their myeloid precursor cells were unable to
differentiate into granulocytes upon stimulation with granulocyte
colony-stimulating factor (138970) but could develop into mature
macrophages. They found that macrophages of the Gfi1-null animals
produced enhanced levels of inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor
necrosis factor (191160), interleukin-10 (124092), and
interleukin-1-beta (147720), when stimulated with bacterial
lipopolysaccharide, and that Gfi1-null mice succumb to low doses of this
endotoxin that were tolerated by wildtype mice. They concluded that Gfi1
influences the differentiation of myeloid precursors into granulocytes
or monocytes and acts in limiting the inflammatory immune response.

A mutation of the POU4F3 gene (602460) underlies human autosomal
dominant nonsyndromic progressive hearing loss (DFNA15; 602459). By
comparing inner ear gene expression profiles of embryonic day 16.5
wildtype and Pou4f3-mutant deaf mice, Hertzano et al. (2004) identified
the GFI1 gene as a target gene regulated by Pou4f3. Deficiency of Pou4f3
led to a reduction in Gfi1 expression levels, and the dynamics of Gfi1
mRNA abundance closely followed the pattern of expression for Pou4f3.
Immunohistochemical and ultrastructural analyses revealed that loss of
Gfi1 resulted in outer hair cell degeneration, which appeared comparable
to that observed in Pou4f3 mutants. Hertzano et al. (2004) concluded
that GFI1 is the first downstream target of a hair cell-specific
transcription factor, and they suggested that outer hair cell
degeneration in Pou4f3 mutants may be largely or entirely a result of
the loss of expression of GFI1.

Zhu et al. (2006) tested the physiologic function of Gfi1 in peripheral
T cells by generating conditional Gfi1-knockout mice. Deletion of Gfi
impaired proliferation and increased apoptosis of Th2 cells, but not Th1
cells, in vitro and in vivo in response to Il2. Overexpression of Stat5
failed to restore normal Th2 expansion in Gfi1-deficient cells. Mutant
mice infected with Schistosoma mansoni had a reduced frequency of Il4
(147780)-producing cells, whereas Th1 responses to Toxoplasma gondii
were unimpaired.

Zhu et al. (2009) generated conditional knockout mice in which Gfi1 was
deleted only in T cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation, flow cytometric,
and RT-PCR analyses demonstrated defects in Th2 cell expansion and
enhanced Ifng (147570) production in the mutant mice. Il4-induced Gfi1
expression inhibited Il17 (603149) production, but not induction of
Ror-gamma-t (602943) in cells primed with Tgfb (190180) plus Il6
(147620). Gfi1 also limited Tgfb-mediated differentiation of inducible
Treg cells. In the absence of Gfi1, the percentage of natural Treg cells
expressing Cd103 and Foxp3 (300292) was increased. Gfi1 expression was
also downregulated by Tgfb. Zhu et al. (2009) concluded that GFI1 plays
a critical role both in enhancing Th2 cell expansion and in the
epigenetic regulation of Th17 and Cd103-positive inducible Treg cell
differentiation.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
NEUTROPENIA, SEVERE CONGENITAL, 2, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
GFI1, ASN382SER

Person et al. (2003) identified a heterozygous 1412A-G transition in the
GFI1 gene causing an asn382-to-ser (N382S) substitution in the fifth
zinc finger in a 4-month-old boy with severe congenital neutropenia
(SCN2; 613107) who had a neutrophil count of zero and marked
monocytosis. The mutation segregated with his 3-year-old paternal half
brother, who was identically affected, and with their father, who had
recurrent pneumonia and pyogenic abscesses abating during childhood. The
father's childhood blood counts were not available, but at age 27 his
neutrophil count was low and monocytes high. His peripheral blood showed
a population of myeloid cells that appeared immature. The myeloid, but
not erythroid, colony formation potential of his cultured peripheral
blood was lower than normal; nonerythroid colonies had intact
differentiation to monocytes or macrophages but had an excess of myeloid
precursors with no mature neutrophils. The absolute cell number of CD4 T
lymphocytes was reduced. Moreover, B lymphocytes were also reduced.
Peripheral blood lymphocytes from both the father and the older son
showed similar trends, and both had poor uptake of 3H-thymidine after
stimulation with phytohemagglutinin, alloantigen, and Candida albicans
compared with normal individuals. Nonetheless, the child had adequate
circulating titers to immunizations, and all immunoglobulin isotypes
were present in his serum, indicating that, though reduced in number and
activation potential, the T and B lymphocyte populations were
functional. Person et al. (2003) demonstrated that GFI1 represses ELA2
(130130), mutant in most cases of autosomal dominant severe congenital
neutropenia, linking these 2 genes in a common pathway involved in
myeloid differentiation.

.0002
NEUTROPENIA, NONIMMUNE CHRONIC IDIOPATHIC, OF ADULTS
GFI1, LYS403ARG

Nonimmune chronic idiopathic neutropenia of adults (NI-CINA; 607847) is
manifested by neutropenia milder than that in severe congenital
neutropenia (see SCN2; 613107), is diagnosed in adults, and also
predisposes to leukemia in a subset of patients (Papadaki et al., 2002).
Person et al. (2003) identified heterozygosity for a 1475A-G transition
in GFI1, causing the amino acid substitution lys403-to-arg (K403R) in
the sixth zinc finger. The patient had been found to be neutropenic 10
years earlier and thereafter had persistently low neutrophil count and
elevated monocytes. Analysis for acquired causes had proven negative,
including drug exposures and autoimmune serologies (antibodies against
nuclear antigens, against double-stranded DNA, against polymorphonuclear
leukocytes, and against rheumatoid factors). She was not known ever to
have had a normal blood count. There was no history of infectious
complications. There were no living close relatives.

601290	TITLE *601290 STRATIFIN; SFN
;;14-3-3-SIGMA
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SFN, or 14-3-3-sigma, is a regulator of mitotic translation that
interacts with a variety of translation and initiation factors (Wilker
et al., 2007).

CLONING

Leffers et al. (1993) obtained peptide sequence and subsequently cloned
a T-cell cDNA of the 14-3-3 family (see 113508) of conserved proteins.
The protein, called stratifin, was shown to be diffusely distributed in
the cytoplasm and was present in cultured epithelial cells. It was most
abundant in tissues enriched in stratified keratinizing epithelium.

MAPPING

Hermeking et al. (1997) mapped the SFN gene to chromosome 1p35 using
fluorescence in situ hybridization.

GENE FUNCTION

Through a quantitative analysis of gene expression patterns in
colorectal cancer cell lines, Hermeking et al. (1997) discovered that
14-3-3-sigma, or stratifin, is strongly induced by gamma irradiation and
other DNA-damaging agents. The induction of 14-3-3-sigma is mediated by
a p53 (191170)-responsive element located 1.8 kb upstream of its
transcription start site. Exogenous introduction of 14-3-3-sigma into
cycling cells results in a G2 arrest. As the fission yeast 14-3-3
homologs rad24 and rad25 mediate similar checkpoint effects, Hermeking
et al. (1997) concluded that the results document a molecular mechanism
for G2/M control that is conserved throughout eukaryotic evolution and
regulated in human cells by p53.

Chan et al. (1999) described an improved approach to the generation of
human somatic cell knockouts, which they used to generate human
colorectal cancer cells in which both 14-3-3-sigma alleles were
inactivated. After DNA damage, these cells initially arrested in the G2
phase of the cell cycle, but unlike cells containing 14-3-3-sigma, the
14-3-3-sigma -/- cells were unable to maintain cell cycle arrest. The
14-3-3-sigma -/- cells died (mitotic catastrophe) as they entered
mitosis. This process was associated with a failure of the
14-3-3-sigma-deficient cells to sequester the proteins (cyclin B,
123836; CDC2, 116940) that initiate mitosis and prevent them from
entering the nucleus. Chan et al. (1999) concluded that these results
indicated a mechanism for maintaining the G2 checkpoint and preventing
mitotic death.

Expression of 14-3-3-sigma is induced in response to DNA damage, and
causes cells to arrest in G2. By SAGE, Ferguson et al. (2000) identified
sigma as a gene whose expression is 7-fold lower in breast carcinoma
cells than in normal breast epithelium. Although genetic alterations at
the SFN locus such as loss of heterozygosity were rare and no mutations
were detected, the authors found that hypermethylation of CpG islands in
the SFN gene could be detected in 91% of breast tumors and was
associated with lack of gene expression. Treatment of
sigma-nonexpressing breast cancer cell lines with the drug
5-aza-2-prime-deoxycytidine resulted in demethylation of the gene and
synthesis of sigma mRNA. Breast cancer cells lacking sigma expression
showed an increased number of chromosomal breaks and gaps when exposed
to gamma-irradiation. Ferguson et al. (2000) thought it possible that
loss of sigma expression contributes to malignant transformation by
impairing the G2 cell cycle checkpoint function, thus allowing an
accumulation of genetic defects. They suggested that hypermethylation
and loss of sigma expression were the most consistent molecular
alterations identified in breast cancer.

Urano et al. (2002) demonstrated that EFP (600453) is a
RING-finger-dependent ubiquitin ligase (E3) that targets proteolysis of
14-3-3-sigma, a negative cell cycle regulator that causes G2 arrest.
Urano et al. (2002) demonstrated that tumor growth of breast cancer MCF7
cells implanted in female athymic mice is reduced by treatment with
antisense Efp oligonucleotide. Efp-overexpressing MCF7 cells in
ovariectomized athymic mice generated tumors in the absence of estrogen.
Loss of Efp function in mouse embryonic fibroblasts resulted in an
accumulation of 14-3-3-sigma, which was responsible for reduced cell
growth. Urano et al. (2002) concluded that their data provide an insight
into the cell cycle machinery and tumorigenesis of breast cancer by
identifying 14-3-3-sigma as a target for proteolysis by EFP, leading to
cell proliferation.

Wilker et al. (2007) reported a previously unknown function for
14-3-3-sigma as a regulator of mitotic translation through its direct
mitosis-specific binding to a variety of translation/initiation factors,
including eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (EIF4B; 603928) in a
stoichiometric manner. Cells lacking 14-3-3-sigma, in marked contrast to
normal cells, cannot suppress cap-dependent translation and do not
stimulate cap-independent translation during and immediately after
mitosis. This defective switch in the mechanism of translation results
in reduced mitotic-specific expression of the endogenous internal
ribosomal entry site (IRES)-dependent form of the cyclin-dependent
kinase CDK11 (p58 PITSLRE; 176873), leading to impaired cytokinesis,
loss of Polo-like kinase-1 (602098) at the midbody, and the accumulation
of binucleate cells. The aberrant mitotic phenotype of
14-3-3-sigma-depleted cells can be rescued by forced expression of CDK11
or by extinguishing cap-dependent translation and increasing
cap-independent translation during mitosis by using rapamycin. Wilker et
al. (2007) concluded that their findings showed how aberrant mitotic
translation in the absence of 14-3-3-sigma impairs mitotic exit to
generate binucleate cells and provides a potential explanation of how
14-3-3-sigma-deficient cells may progress on the path to aneuploidy and
tumorigenesis.

A large proportion of aggressive squamous cell carcinomas in humans and
mice express markedly reduced IKKA (CHUK; 600664), and somatic mutations
in IKKA have been identified in human squamous cell carcinomas. Zhu et
al. (2007) identified 14-3-3-sigma as a downstream target of Ikka in
cell cycle regulation in response to DNA damage and found that the
14-3-3-sigma locus was hypermethylated in Ikka -/- mouse keratinocytes,
but not in wildtype keratinocytes. Trimethylated histone H3-lys9 (see
602810) associated with Suv39h1 (300254) and Dnmt3a (602769) in the
methylated 14-3-3-sigma locus. Reintroduction of Ikka restored
14-3-3-sigma expression by associating with H3 and preventing access of
Suv39h1 to H3, thereby preventing hypermethylation of 14-3-3-sigma. Zhu
et al. (2007) concluded that IKKA protects the 14-3-3-sigma locus from
hypermethylation, which serves as a mechanism of maintaining genomic
stability in keratinocytes.

Choi et al. (2011) showed that the ubiquitin ligase COP1 (RFWD2; 608067)
targeted 14-3-3-sigma for ubiquitin-mediated degradation in human cell
lines. The COP9 signalosome subunit COPS6 (614729) stabilized COP1 by
reducing COP1 autoubiquitination, resulting in elevated 14-3-3-sigma
ubiquitination and degradation.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

The 14-3-3 family of proteins mediates signal transduction by binding to
phosphoserine-containing proteins. Using phosphoserine-oriented peptide
libraries to probe all mammalian and yeast 14-3-3s, Yaffe et al. (1997)
identified 2 different binding motifs, RSXpSXP and RXY/FXpSXP, present
in nearly all known 14-3-3 binding proteins. The crystal structure of
YWHAZ (601288) complexed with the phosphoserine motif in polyoma
middle-T was determined to 2.6-angstrom resolution. The authors showed
that the 14-3-3 dimer binds tightly to single molecules containing
tandem repeats of phosphoserine motifs, implicating bidentate
association as a signaling mechanism with molecules such as Raf, BAD
(603167), and Cbl.

ANIMAL MODEL

Stratifin is highly expressed in differentiating epidermis and mediates
cell cycle arrest. To extend understanding of skin development, Herron
et al. (2005) set out to identify the causal mutation in 'repeated
epilation' (Er) mutant mice. The heterozygous mutant (Er/+) mouse was
originally identified in the offspring of a male exposed to gamma
radiation; the mutant had a disheveled appearance at 3 weeks of age.
Older heterozygous mice had an increased incidence of papillomas and
squamous cell carcinomas. Linkage studies localized the Er gene to mouse
chromosome 4 in an 820-kb region containing 22 genes. Among these genes,
Sfn was considered a good candidate for underlying the Er mutation
because it has a role in keratinocyte differentiation and because Sfn
expression is abnormal in epithelial cancers. Sequencing of the Sfn open
reading frame in genomic DNA from homozygous Er/Er and wildtype mice
detected a single T insertion at basepair 622 in homozygous mutant mice.
This frameshift mutation at amino acid 207 truncates the C terminus of
the protein encoded by the Er allele, eliminating residues required for
ligand interaction and the nuclear export sequence.

By gene expression analysis of skin and embryonic fibroblasts from
wildtype and Er mice, Li et al. (2005) identified a 1-bp insertion
(642insT) in the Sfn gene that results in the Er phenotype. The
insertion causes a frameshift leading to a truncated protein lacking 40
amino acids at the C terminus. Li et al. (2005) noted that Er/+ adult
mice showed repeated hair loss, whereas Er/Er mutant mice died at birth
due to respiratory distress and skin defects, with hyperplastic
epidermis, failure of keratinocyte differentiation, and abnormal
craniofacial development. Ectopic overexpression of Sfn in Er/Er
keratinocytes rescued the defects of keratinocyte differentiation.

176740	TITLE *176740 PROLIFERATING CELL NUCLEAR ANTIGEN; PCNA
;;DNA POLYMERASE DELTA AUXILIARY PROTEIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Travali et al. (1989) isolated a cDNA clone of the entire human PCNA
gene and flanking sequences.

PCNA was originally identified by immunofluorescence as a nuclear
protein whose appearance correlated with the proliferative state of the
cell. A cell cycle-dependent protein described by Bravo (1986) and
called cyclin was shown to be identical to PCNA. The PCNA protein has
been highly conserved during evolution; the deduced amino acid sequences
of rat and human differ by only 4 of 261 amino acids. The human
anti-PCNA autoantibodies react not only with the nuclei of proliferating
cells of all experimental animals so far examined but also with the
nuclei of plant cells. Suzuka et al. (1989) demonstrated the presence of
the PCNA/cyclin-related genes in higher plants.

GENE FUNCTION

PCNA is required for replication of SV40 DNA in vitro and has been
identified as the auxiliary protein (cofactor) for DNA polymerase delta
(174761). Unlike DNA polymerases alpha (312040), beta (174760), and
gamma (174763), DNA polymerase delta has exonuclease activity. Since the
exonuclease activity is in the 3-prime-to-5-prime direction, DNA
polymerase delta has a proofreading activity and is expected to play a
significant role in the maintenance of the fidelity of mammalian DNA
replication (Suzuka et al., 1989).

It had been speculated that genetic engineering could improve the
long-term function of vascular grafts that are prone to atherosclerosis
and occlusion. Mann et al. (1995) showed that an 'intraoperative gene
therapy approach' using antisense oligodeoxynucleotides to block medial
smooth muscle cell proliferation can prevent the accelerated
atherosclerosis that is responsible for autologous vein graft failure.
Selective prevention of the expression of genes for 2 cell cycle
regulatory proteins, PCNA and cell division cycle kinase-2 (CDK2;
116953), was achieved in the smooth muscle cells of rabbit jugular veins
grafted into the carotid arteries. This alteration of gene expression
successfully redirected vein graft biology away from neointimal
hyperplasia and toward medial hypertrophy, yielding conduits that more
closely resembled normal arteries. Furthermore, the genetically
engineered grafts proved resistant to diet-induced atherosclerosis.

Hasan et al. (2001) demonstrated that p300 (602700) may have a role in
DNA repair synthesis through its interaction with PCNA. Hasan et al.
(2001) demonstrated that in vitro and in vivo p300 forms a complex with
PCNA that does not depend on the S phase of the cell cycle. A large
fraction of both p300 and PCNA colocalized to speckled structures in the
nucleus. Furthermore, the endogenous p300-PCNA complex stimulates DNA
synthesis in vitro. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments indicated
that p300 is associated with freshly synthesized DNA after ultraviolet
irradiation. Hasan et al. (2001) suggested the p300 may participate in
chromatin remodeling at DNA lesion sites to facilitate PCNA function in
DNA repair synthesis.

The RAD6 pathway (312180, 179095) is central to postreplicative DNA
repair in eukaryotic cells. Two principal elements of this pathway are
the ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes RAD6 and the MMS2 (603001)-UBC13
(603679) heterodimer, which are recruited to chromatin by the RING
finger proteins RAD18 (605256) and RAD5 (608048), respectively. Hoege et
al. (2002) showed that UBC9 (601661), a SUMO (see 601912)-conjugating
enzyme, is also affiliated with this pathway and that PCNA, a DNA
polymerase sliding clamp involved in DNA synthesis and repair, is a
substrate. PCNA is monoubiquitinated through RAD6 and RAD18, modified by
lys63-linked multiubiquitination, which additionally requires MMS2,
UBC13, and RAD5, and is conjugated to SUMO by UBC9. All 3 modifications
affect the same lysine residue of PCNA, lys164, suggesting that they
label PCNA for alternative functions. Hoege et al. (2002) demonstrated
that these modifications differentially affect resistance to DNA damage,
and that damage-induced PCNA ubiquitination is elementary for DNA repair
and occurs at the same conserved residue in yeast and humans.

SUMO uses a ubiquitin conjugation system to counteract the effects of
ubiquitination. Ubiquitin and SUMO compete for modification of PCNA, an
essential processivity factor for DNA replication and repair. Whereas
multiubiquitination is mediated by components of the RAD6 pathway and
promotes error-free repair, SUMO modification is associated with
replication. Stelter and Ulrich (2003) demonstrated that RAD6-mediated
monoubiquitination of PCNA activates translesion DNA synthesis by the
damage-tolerant polymerases eta (603968) and zeta (602776) in yeast.
Moreover, polymerase zeta is differentially affected by monoubiquitin
and SUMO modification of PCNA. Whereas ubiquitination is required for
damage-induced mutagenesis, both SUMO and monoubiquitin contribute to
spontaneous mutagenesis in the absence of DNA damage. Stelter and Ulrich
(2003) concluded that their data assigned a function to SUMO during S
phase and demonstrated how ubiquitin and SUMO, by regulating the
accuracy of replication and repair, contribute to overall genomic
stability.

Poot et al. (2004) identified 4 potential PCNA-binding motifs in
Williams syndrome transcription factor (WSTF, or BAZ1B; 605681). By
immunoprecipitation and in vitro protein pull-down experiments with HeLa
cell nuclear extracts, they confirmed a direct interaction between PCNA
and WSTF that did not require DNA. The complex containing PCNA was
distinct from the WSTF-including nucleosome assembly complex (WINAC).
Poot et al. (2004) found that PCNA targeted WSTF to DNA replication
foci, and WSTF, in turn, recruited SNF2H (SMARCA5; 603375) to
replication sites. RNA interference-mediated depletion of WSTF or SNF2H
caused compaction of newly replicated chromatin and increased the amount
of heterochromatin markers.

In yeast, chromatid cohesion is essential for viability and is triggered
by the conserved protein Eco1. Moldovan et al. (2006) found that yeast
Eco1 and its human homolog, ESCO2 (609353), interacted directly with
PCNA via a conserved PIP box variant in their N termini. Yeast Eco1
mutants deficient in Eco1-Pcna interaction were defective in chromatid
cohesion and inviable. Moldovan et al. (2006) concluded that PCNA is
crucially involved in the establishment of cohesion in S phase.

Maga et al. (2007) analyzed the effects of human PCNA and replication
protein A (RPA; 179835) on 6 different human DNA polymerases belonging
to the B, Y, and X classes during in vitro bypass of different lesions.
The mutagenic lesion 8-oxo-guanine has high miscoding potential. A major
and specific effect was found for 8-oxo-G bypass with DNA pol-lambda
(606343) and -eta (603968). PCNA and RPA allowed correct incorporation
of dCTP opposite an 8-oxo-G template 1,200-fold more efficiently than
the incorrect dATP by DNA pol-lambda, and 68-fold by DNA pol-eta,
respectively. Experiments with DNA pol-gamma (174763)-null cell extracts
suggested an important role for DNA pol-lambda. On the other hand, DNA
pol-iota (605252) together with DNA pol-alpha (312040), -delta (174761),
and -beta (174760), showed a much lower correct bypass efficiency. Maga
et al. (2007) concluded that their findings showed the existence of an
accurate mechanism to reduce the deleterious consequences of oxidative
damage and, in addition, pointed to an important role for PCNA and RPA
in determining a functional hierarchy among different DNA pols in lesion
bypass.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Bowman et al. (2004) reported the crystal structure of the 5-protein
clamp loader complex (replication factor-C, RFC; see 102579) of the
yeast S. cerevisiae, bound to the sliding clamp (PCNA). Tight
interfacial coordination of the ATP analog ATP-gamma-S by RFC resulted
in a spiral arrangement of the ATPase domains of the clamp loader above
the PCNA ring. Placement of a model for primed DNA within the central
hole of PCNA revealed a striking correspondence between the RFC spiral
and the grooves of the DNA double helix. Bowman et al. (2004) concluded
that this model, in which the clamp loader complex locks into primed DNA
in a screwcap-like arrangement, provides a simple explanation for the
process by which the engagement of primer-template junctions by the
RFC:PCNA complex results in ATP hydrolysis and release of the sliding
clamp on DNA.

GENE STRUCTURE

Travali et al. (1989) showed that the human PCNA gene is present in
single copy and has 6 exons. It spans 4,961 bp, from the cap site to the
poly(A) signal. An unusual feature was the presence of extensive
sequence similarities among introns and between introns and exons.

MAPPING

Ku et al. (1989) mapped the PCNA gene to chromosome 20 by Southern
analysis of somatic cell hybrid DNA. Two pseudogenes were identified,
one mapping to Xpter-q13 and a second mapping to 6pter-p12. By in situ
hybridization, Webb et al. (1990) assigned the locus to 20p13. They also
found 2 strong secondary peaks of grains over 11p15.1 and Xp11.4. From
studies by in situ hybridization, Rao et al. (1991) concluded that the
PCNA gene is located at or close to 20p12.

- PSEUDOGENES

Taniguchi et al. (1996) characterized 2 'new' PCNA pseudogenes that are
tandemly localized on 4q24. One is a pseudogene and the other is a
truncated pseudogene.

603846	TITLE *603846 NADH-UBIQUINONE OXIDOREDUCTASE Fe-S PROTEIN 3; NDUFS3
;;COMPLEX I, MITOCHONDRIAL RESPIRATORY CHAIN, 30-KD SUBUNIT
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The multisubunit NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) is the first
enzyme complex in the electron transport chain of mitochondria. The
iron-sulfur protein (IP) fraction of complex I is made up of 7 subunits.
See NDUFS1 (157655).

CLONING

By a combination of EST database searching and RT-PCR, Loeffen et al.
(1998) isolated cDNAs encoding NDUFS2 (602985), NDUFS3, and NDUFS6
(603848), the human homologs of the bovine 49-kD, 30-kD, and 13-kD
subunits of the IP fraction. The predicted 264-amino acid human NDUFS3
protein shares 90% identity with the bovine protein. The first 36 amino
acids of human NDUFS3 comprise a possible mitochondrial targeting
sequence.

Smeitink and van den Heuvel (1999) reviewed the available molecular data
regarding the human nuclear-encoded complex I subunits. They stated that
a small form of complex I, consisting of 14 subunits, is found in
Escherichia coli (Weidner et al., 1993). In this bacterium, all complex
I genes are organized as an operon, called 'Nuo' after the
NADH:ubiquinone oxidase. In most eukaryotes, homologs of NuoB-NuoG and
NuoI are nuclear genes; NDUFS3 is the homolog of NuoC. Comparative
studies showed that the number of nuclear-encoded complex I subunits
increases with the evolutionary complexity of the organism. The 7 human
nuclear-encoded counterparts of the Escherichia coli Nuo proteins,
namely, NDUFV1 (161015), NDUFV2 (600532), NDUFS1, NDUFS2, NDUFS3, NDUFS7
(601825), and NDUFS8 (602141), would be predicted to carry out essential
aspects of complex I function.

GENE FUNCTION

Using human and mouse cells and tissues, Martinvalet et al. (2008) found
that GZMA (140050) activated mitochondrial outer membrane
permeabilization- and caspase-independent cell death pathways by
cleaving NDUFS3 after lys56. NDUFS3 cleavage generated reactive oxygen
species, disrupted the mitochondrial membrane potential, and interfered
with NADH oxidation and ATP synthesis. The generation of reactive oxygen
species induced translocation of the SET complex (see 600960) from the
cytosol to the nucleus, followed by GZMA-mediated activation of the SET
complex DNases NM23H1 (NME1; 156490) and TREX1 (606609), leading to DNA
damage and cell death. SET complex translocation, DNase activation, and
cell death were blocked by superoxide scavengers or by overexpression of
a cleavage-resistant NDUFS3 mutant. Martinvalet et al. (2008) concluded
that cleavage of NDUFS3 is the first step in GZMA-induced cell death.

MAPPING

By analysis of somatic cell hybrids, Loeffen et al. (1998) mapped the
NDUFS3 gene to chromosome 11. By radiation hybrid analysis, Emahazion et
al. (1998) mapped the NDUFS3 to 11p11.11.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a patient with complex I deficiency (252010) and features of Leigh
syndrome (256000), Benit et al. (2004) identified compound
heterozygosity for mutations in the NDUFS3 gene (T145I, 603846.0001 and
R199W, 603846.0002).

In a patient with complex I deficiency, Haack et al. (2012) identified
homozygosity for the R199W mutation.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
LEIGH SYNDROME DUE TO MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX I DEFICIENCY
NDUFS3, THR145ILE

In a boy from Reunion Island with Leigh syndrome (256000) due to complex
I deficiency (252010), Benit et al. (2004) identified compound
heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the NDUFS3 gene: a 434C-T transition
in exon 5, resulting in a thr145-to-ile (T145I) change, and a 595C-T
transition in exon 6, resulting in an arg199-to-trp (R199W; 603846.0002)
change. The boy's psychomotor development was normal until 9 years of
age. He gradually developed severe axial dystonia with oral and
pharyngeal motor dysfunction, dysphagia, and a tetraparetic syndrome,
and died soon after from rapid multisystem deterioration.

.0002
LEIGH SYNDROME DUE TO MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX I DEFICIENCY
MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX I DEFICIENCY, INCLUDED
NDUFS3, ARG199TRP (dbSNP rs104894270)

See 603846.0001 and Benit et al. (2004).

Haack et al. (2012) identified a homozygous 532C-T transition in the
NDUFS3 gene, resulting in an arg199-to-trp (R199W) substitution in a
patient with complex I deficiency (252010). The mutation was identified
by exome sequencing, and is also known as dbSNP rs104894270. The patient
had encephalopathy, myopathy, developmental delay, and lactic acidosis;
Leigh syndrome was not noted. Complex I activity was 28% in muscle and
36% in fibroblasts and there was a decrease in fully assembled complex
I.
