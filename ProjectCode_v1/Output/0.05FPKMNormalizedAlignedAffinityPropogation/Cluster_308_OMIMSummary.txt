EOTAXIN 3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Chemokines, such as CCL26, play pivotal roles in health and disease by
controlling migration and tissue localization of specific types of cells
expressing their cognate receptors. Humans have at least 45 chemokines,
which are grouped into 4 subfamilies (CXC, CC, C, and CX3C) based on the
structural motif of their N-terminal conserved cysteine residues. CCL26
is abundantly produced by IL4 (147780)- and IL13 (147683)-stimulated
vascular endothelial cells and is a functional ligand for CCR3 (601268)
and CX3CR1 (601470). In addition, CCL26 functions as a natural
antagonist for CCR1 (601159), CCR2 (601267), and CCR5 (601373) (summary
by Nakayama et al., 2010).

CLONING

By carrying out an exon search in the vicinity of eotaxin-2 (CCL24;
602495) on chromosome 7, followed by 5-prime and 3-prime RACE, Kitaura
et al. (1999) obtained a human lung cDNA encoding a CC chemokine, CCL26,
which they called eotaxin-3. The deduced 94-amino acid CCL26 protein
contains a 23-amino acid signal peptide and no N-glycosylation sites.
Although CCL26 shares only 33% amino acid identity with eotaxin-2,
phylogenetic tree and receptor usage analyses showed that CCL26 shares
characteristics with eotaxin-2. Northern blot analysis detected a 0.8-kb
CCL26 transcript at low levels in heart and ovary; however, RT-PCR
analysis detected ubiquitous expression of CCL26.

By searching an EST database, Guo et al. (1999) identified a fetal heart
cDNA encoding CCL26. Northern blot analysis detected a 1.8-kb CCL26
transcript at high levels in heart and liver, and at lower levels in
skeletal muscle and kidney; a 0.6-kb transcript was detected at low
levels in heart, liver, skeletal muscle, and kidney.

MAPPING

Using FISH, Guo et al. (1999) mapped the CCL26 gene to chromosome
7q11.2, where the majority of CC chemokine genes are found.

GENE FUNCTION

Kitaura et al. (1999) found that CCL26 induced migration of eosinophils
and basophils only at a 10-fold higher concentration than eotaxin
(CCL11; 601156).

Using chemotaxis and cellular assays, as well as flow cytometry and
RT-PCR analysis, Nakayama et al. (2010) demonstrated that CCL26 is a
functional ligand of both CCR3 and CX3CR1, a receptor for CX3CL1
(601880). At relatively high concentrations, human CCL26 induced calcium
flux and chemotaxis in mouse cells expressing human CX3CR1, but not
mouse Cx3cr1, and competed with CX3CL1 for CX3CR1 binding. Like CX3CL1,
CCL26 attracted eosinophils, natural killer (NK) cells, terminally
differentiated CD8 (see 186910)-positive cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and
homeostatic monocytes. Intraperitoneal injection of CCL26 resulted in
rapid recruitment of mouse eosinophils and intravenously injected human
NK cells to the peritoneal cavity. IL4-stimulated human umbilical vein
endothelial cells produced CCL26 and induced adhesion of
CX3CR1-expressing cells. Psoriasis (see 177900) and atopic dermatitis
(see 603165) lesions both expressed CX3CR1 mRNA, but CX3CL1 was
expressed in the former and only sometimes in the latter. In contrast,
CCL26 was always expressed in atopic dermatitis lesions. Nakayama et al.
(2010) suggested that CCL26 may be partly responsible for the
recruitment of cells expressing CX3CR1 in atopic dermatitis lesions when
CX3CL1 expression is low. They concluded that CCL26 is another agonist
for CX3CR1 and may act in allergic diseases by attracting eosinophils
via CCR3 and killer lymphocytes and resident monocytes via CX3CR1.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Sialophorin (leukosialin) is a major sialoglycoprotein on the surface of
human T lymphocytes, monocytes, granulocytes, and some B lymphocytes,
which appears to be important for immune function and may be part of a
physiologic ligand-receptor complex involved in T-cell activation.

CLONING

Pallant et al. (1989) stated that sialophorin had been identified by the
L10 monoclonal antibody. Pallant et al. (1989) isolated a cDNA clone
encoding leukosialin from a library constructed from human peripheral
blood cells. Southern blot analysis suggested that the gene is present
in single copy.

Shelley et al. (1988, 1989) isolated and sequenced cDNA clones for
sialophorin. The longest sequenced clone was 1.7 kb and encoded 5 of 7
isolated tryptic peptides. Northern blot analysis indicated that the
sialophorin transcript is 2.5 kb long. The nucleotide sequence of the
1.7-kb clone showed that the sialophorin transcript has a
3-prime-noncoding region of 587 nucleotides, is polyadenylated, and has
the AATAAA polyadenylation signal. The derived sequence of 341 amino
acids showed that the sialophorin protein has 3 domains: an
extracellular domain of 195 amino acids, a hydrophobic transmembrane
domain of 23 amino acids, and a C-terminal intracellular domain of 123
amino acids which contains a number of sites that might be
phosphorylated by protein kinase C.

GENE FUNCTION

By introducing a cDNA encoding the human CD43 protein into an
antigen-responsive murine T-cell hybridoma, Park et al. (1991) found
that the antigen-specific activation of T cells was enhanced. The
intracellular domain of CD43, which is hyperphosphorylated during T-cell
activation, was required for this function.

Schmid et al. (1992) presented evidence that the galactoglycoprotein of
plasma represents the extracellular portion of CD43 derived by
proteolytic cleavage from the transmembrane portion. Bazil and
Strominger (1993) showed that CD43 is proteolytically cleaved from the
surface of stimulated lymphocytes and granulocytes. They suggested that
induced enzymatic cleavage of leukocyte receptors may represent a
general mechanism regulating surface expression of these molecules.

Using immunoprecipitation and cell-binding analyses, van den Berg et al.
(2001) showed that both the 240-kD SELPLG (600738) and the 130-kD CD43
proteins bind to macrophage-restricted SIGLEC1 (SN; 600751) in solution.
However, only T cell-bound CD43, and not SELPLG, in either the branched
or unbranched glycoform binds when expressed on the cell surface. Thus,
CD43 is the T-cell counterreceptor for SN.

The immunologic synapse is the T cell-APC (antigen-presenting cell)
contact site where T-cell receptors (TCRs), coreceptors, signaling
molecules, and adhesion receptors polarize upon antigen recognition. The
formation of the immunologic synapse is thought to be important for
receptor signal transduction and full T-lymphocyte activation. CD43 is a
large sialoprotein diffusely expressed in unactivated T cells. Using
antigen-activated T cells and confocal microscopy, Delon et al. (2001)
demonstrated that moesin (309845) is excluded from the region of T
cell-APC contact and colocalizes with CD43. Western blot and
immunocytochemical analyses showed that moesin is rapidly
dephosphorylated upon antigen recognition and then rephosphorylated on
threonine residues. Only phosphorylated moesin was able to bind CD43.
Delon et al. (2001) concluded that T-cell activation requires the
removal of CD43 from the immunologic synapse to allow efficient
engagement of the TCR with molecules on the APC.

Using mouse helper T cell lines and confocal microscopy, Allenspach et
al. (2001) determined that the cytoplasmic tail of CD43 is necessary and
sufficient for CD43 removal from the immunologic synapse. In at least
some cells, CD43 is located at the distal pole of the T cell together
with ezrin (123900) and moesin. No differences in the behavior of ezrin
and moesin were noted throughout the study. Using cells from Cd43 -/-
mice, Allenspach et al. (2001) observed that ezrin-radixin
(179410)-moesin (ERM) family proteins move independently of the large
CD43 mucin. Overexpression of a dominant-negative ERM mutant containing
the N-terminal 320 amino acids of ezrin inhibited the activation-induced
movement of CD43 without affecting conjugate formation. The
dominant-negative mutant reduced cytokine production but not the
expression of T-cell activation markers.

GENE STRUCTURE

Shelley et al. (1990) reported that the CD43 gene has a single intron of
378 bp that interrupts the sequence specifying the 5-prime untranslated
region of the mRNA. The gene is, therefore, unusual in that the discrete
extracellular, transmembrane, and intracellular regions of the protein,
including repeat sequences in the extracellular region, are not encoded
by separate exons.

MAPPING

Shelley et al. (1989) determined that the human sialophorin gene appears
to be unique within the haploid genome, and they assigned it to
chromosome 16 by Southern blot analysis of DNA from rodent-human cell
hybrids. By study of somatic cell hybrids, Pallant et al. (1989)
demonstrated that the leukosialin gene is not X-linked; by in situ
hybridization, they mapped the gene to 16p11.2. Baecher et al. (1990)
demonstrated that the mouse leukosialin gene, designated Ly48, is
encoded by chromosome 7.

PATHOGENESIS

Sialophorin is defective in lymphocytes of patients with Wiskott-Aldrich
syndrome (301000). Since the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome is X-linked, its
primary cause must reside in a defect of a gene other than the
structural gene for sialophorin. (The existence of an autosomal form of
Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome has been suggested (277970).) Specific
interaction of CD43 with a ligand on the surface of T cells appears to
contribute to T-cell activation. Rosenstein et al. (1991) presented
evidence that intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM1, or CD54; 147840)
is a ligand for CD43. Rosenstein et al. (1991) suggested that the defect
in T-cell function in Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome may result from defective
CD43/ICAM1 interaction. Many patients with HIV infection have
circulating anti-CD43 antibodies; these autoantibodies may contribute to
the severe immunodeficiency found in AIDS patients.

180990	TITLE *180990 PROLINE-RICH PROTEIN, BstNI SUBFAMILY, 4; PRB4
;;BASIC SALIVARY PROLINE-RICH PROTEIN, BstNI TYPE, 4
SALIVARY PROTEIN Po, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION For background information on salivary proline-rich proteins, see PRB1
(180989).

Azen and Yu (1984) defined another polymorphism in the proteins of
parotid saliva. Called Po, it was typed on immunoblots after transfer
from SDS gels to nitrocellulose. The Po+ allele had a frequency of 0.75
in whites and 0.77 in blacks. Po is probably linked to the salivary
protein complex (SPC); Po versus CON2 showed a maximum lod score of 2.35
at theta = 0.0.

Azen and Yu (1984) demonstrated 2 genetically polymorphic parotid
salivary proteins, CON1 and CON2, by reaction with concanavalin A after
electrophoresis in SDS polyacrylamide gels and transfer to
nitrocellulose. Linkage of CON1 to Ps (168810) was found (lod = 6.77 at
theta 0.0), and of CON2 to PmF (lod = 5.93 at theta = 0.0). PmF is the
same as Pm (180989). PmS is perhaps a separate locus which encodes a
protein that shows a close association with PmF. CON2 is linked (Azen
and Yu, 1984) to G1 (lod = 3.91 at theta = 0.0).

By molecular genetic studies, Azen et al. (1996) demonstrated that the
CON1 glycoprotein is encoded in exon 3 of a PRB2 allele (168810) with a
potential N-linked glycosylation site. On the other hand, the CON2
glycoprotein is encoded in exon 3 of the PRB1 allele (180989) with a
potential glycosylation site. The Po protein and a glycoprotein (II-1)
are indeed encoded in the PRB4 gene. The authors noted that
concanavalin-A binding proteins are of special biologic interest, since
they, like other proline-rich proteins of the saliva, might bind to
specific oral bacteria and modulate intraoral disease susceptibility.

Chan and Bennick (2001) showed that in vitro translated PRB4S, a
proprotein encoded by a small allele of the PRB4 gene, was cleaved by
furin (FUR; 136950) at a consensus cleavage site (RSARS) to produce
II-1, a glycosylated PRP, and IB-5, a basic PRP. A human submandibular
cell line transfected with PRB4S secreted II-1 and IB-5, and the degree
of cleavage was enhanced by coexpression of furin with PRB4S. Cleavage
occurred before exit of the proteins from the trans-Golgi network. Cells
lacking furin also cleaved PRB4S in culture, indicating that other
convertases can cleave PRB4S.

;;GROWTH HORMONE, VARIANT; GHV;;
GROWTH HORMONE, PLACENTAL; GH2;;
GROWTH HORMONE-LIKE; GHL
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Lewis et al. (1978) described a structural variant of human growth
hormone (GH1; 139250), which they called growth hormone-2, or GH2. Its
molecular mass was estimated to be about 20 kD, whereas GH1 has a
molecular mass of about 22 kD. The variant had several amino acid
differences and reacted poorly with antibody to human growth hormone.
Seeburg (1982) studied the structure of the GH2 gene, which they
referred to as the GHV gene, and Pavlakis et al. (1981) studied the
protein resulting from its in vitro expression. Frankenne et al. (1987)
showed that a placental variant of growth hormone, which appears in
maternal serum in midpregnancy and rises in concentration thereafter to
term, is the product of the GHV gene. The GHV gene is not expressed in
the pituitary. Liebhaber et al. (1989) showed that the GHV gene is
expressed in the term placenta, specifically in the
syncytiotrophoblastic epithelium. The similarity in developmental and
tissue-specific expression to that of the related CSA (150200) and CSB
(118820) genes suggested that these genes may share common regulatory
elements.

GENE STRUCTURE

The GH2 gene differs from the GH1 gene by the presence of a GT-to-AT
transition at the 5-prime donor splice site of intron 2 (Chen et al.,
1989). A cryptic site develops at nucleotide +19.

Boguszewski et al. (1998) noted that the GHN (GH1) and GHV (GH2) genes
consist of 5 exons. They examined alternative splicing of GHV
transcripts. The coding region of the GHV gene was amplified by RT-PCR
using placental cDNA as template. DNA sequencing of several clones
revealed 2 novel transcripts. One transcript isoform had a 45-bp
deletion caused by the use of an alternative 3-prime splice site in exon
3, similar to that in the GH1 gene, and is predicted to encode a 20-kD
GHV protein isoform. The other transcript isoform arose by the use of an
alternative 5-prime splice site which caused a 4-bp deletion in the end
of exon 4 and is predicted to encode a 24-kD protein with 219 amino
acids, which the authors referred to as GHV3. The carboxy-terminal
sequence of GHV3 differs from those of 22-kD GHV and GHV2, the 2
previously reported transcripts of the GHV gene, and does not contain a
predicted transmembrane domain as described for GHV2. The authors
concluded that the GHV transcript undergoes alternative splicing
pathways that can generate at least 4 different mRNA isoforms,
predicting the expression of different GH protein products, including 2
with a complete sequence divergence in the carboxy terminus.

GENE FUNCTION

Chellakooty et al. (2004) evaluated the association of maternal serum
levels of placental GH and IGF1 (147440) with fetal growth in a
prospective longitudinal study of 89 normal pregnant women. Placental GH
levels were detectable in all samples from as early as 5 weeks'
gestation and increased significantly throughout pregnancy until
approximately 37 weeks' gestation, when peak levels of 22 ng/ml were
reached. Subsequently, placental GH levels decreased until birth. The
change in placental GH during 24.5 to 37.5 weeks' gestation was
positively associated with fetal growth rate (P = 0.027) and birth
weight (P = 0.027). Gestational age at peak placental GH values (P =
0.007) was associated with pregnancy length. A positive association
between the change in placental GH and the change in IGF1 levels
throughout gestation was found in a multivariate analysis (r(2) = 0.42;
P less than 0.001).

MAPPING

By combination of restriction mapping with somatic cell hybridization,
Owerbach et al. (1980) localized the GH2 gene, which they called 'growth
hormone-like' (GHL), to chromosome 17.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

MacLeod et al. (1991) found abnormally large GHV mRNAs in 1 of 20
placentas. Sequence analysis demonstrated retention of the first 12
bases of intron 2, resulting from both a base substitution at the intron
2 splice-donor dinucleotide (GT to AT) and activation of a cryptic
splice-donor site 12 bases downstream. Survey of a total of 60
additional chromosomes failed to reveal other instances of this
mutation. While the importance of GHV to fetal and maternal physiology
remained to be defined, MacLeod et al. (1991) demonstrated by bioassays
that it has a strong somatogen activity. MacLeod et al. (1991) found no
direct evidence to suggest that the splice site mutation in the
heterozygous state has a significant adverse effect on the physiology of
pregnancy, labor, delivery, or fetal development.

605579	TITLE *605579 INTERFERON-INDUCED TRANSMEMBRANE PROTEIN 3; IFITM3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The 1-8 gene family, which includes IFITM1 (604456), IFITM2 (605578),
and IFITM3, is highly inducible by both type I (IFNA; (147660)/IFNB;
(147640)) and type II (IFNG; 147570) interferons (summary by Lewin et
al., 1991).

CLONING

By screening a lymphoid cell cosmid library with a probe corresponding
to the 3-prime untranslated region of IFITM1, Lewin et al. (1991)
isolated a cosmid containing the IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3 genes, which
they termed 9-27, 1-8D, and 1-8U, respectively, within a single 18-kb
fragment. The predicted 133-amino acid IFITM3 protein is approximately
90% identical to IFITM2, has an N-terminal signal sequence, 3 potential
phosphorylation sites, and a C-terminal leucine zipper. Sequence
variability is greatest at the C terminus. Immunoblot analysis showed
that in response to IFNA, all 3 IFITMs were expressed as 14-kD proteins
that could be further resolved by isoelectric focusing.

Everitt et al. (2012) reported that the IFITM3 gene encodes 2 splice
variants that differ by the presence or absence of the N-terminal 21
amino acids.

By whole-mount in situ hybridization, Lange et al. (2003) found that
expression of mouse fragilis, fragilis-2, and fragilis-3 was restricted
to the epiblast at embryonic days 5.5 and 6.5. By embryonic day 7.5, all
3 transcripts showed variable expression in a cluster of founder
premordial germ cells, and at embryonic days 11.5 and 12.5, all 3
transcripts were detected in gonadal germ cells. The 3 transcripts
showed unique patterns of expression in other tissues during mouse
development.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lewin et al. (1991) determined that the IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3 genes
each contain 2 exons, with interferon-stimulated response elements
(ISREs) in the immediately 5-prime flanking sequence of the
promoter/enhancer region. Unlike IFITM1, which has an ISRE and 2 CCAAT
boxes but lacks a TATA box, IFITM2 and IFITM3 have 2 ISREs and no TATA
or CCAAT boxes.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Lange et al. (2003) mapped the IFITM3 gene
to an IFITM gene cluster on chromosome 11p15.5. The order of the genes,
from telomere to centromere, is IFITM5 (614757), IFITM2, IFITM1, and
IFITM3, and the cluster spans about 26.5 kb. Lange et al. (2003) stated
that IFITM2 maps to the plus strand and that all other IFITM genes map
to the minus strand. However, Gross (2012) determined that, in addition
to IFITM2, the IFITM1 gene maps to the plus strand based on an alignment
of the IFITM1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC000897) with the genomic
sequence (GRCh37).

Lange et al. (2003) mapped the mouse Ifitm gene cluster to a region of
chromosome 7F5 that shares homology of synteny with human chromosome
11p15.5. The mouse Ifitm gene cluster contains 5 genes, whereas the
human cluster contains only 4 genes.

GENE FUNCTION

By Northern blot analysis of cells expressing IFITM genes, Lewin et al.
(1991) showed that IFITM2 was not as responsive to IFNA treatment as
IFITM3 or IFITM1.

Tanaka et al. (2005) determined that mouse Ifitm1 and Ifitm3 are
expressed on the cell surface of primordial germ cells in a
developmentally-regulated manner and that they appear to modulate cell
adhesion and influence cell differentiation. Ifitm1 activity was
required for primordial germ cell transit, and Ifitm1 acted as a
repulsive molecule, repelling non-Ifitm1-expressing primordial germ
cells from the mesoderm into the endoderm. In contrast, Ifitm3 was
expressed in migratory primordial germ cells and behaved as a homing
signal, enabling the cells to respond to environmental cues that guided
their localization. The guidance activities of Ifitm1 and Ifitm3 were
mediated by their unique N-terminal domains.

To test the role of IFITM3 in human influenza virus infection, Everitt
et al. (2012) assessed the IFITM3 alleles of individuals hospitalized
with seasonal or pandemic influenza H1N1/09 viruses. Everitt et al.
(2012) found that a statistically significant number of hospitalized
subjects showed enrichment for a minor IFITM3 allele (SNP dbSNP rs12252)
that alters a splice acceptor site, and functional assays showed that
IFITM3 carrying the minor CC genotype had reduced influenza virus
restriction in vitro (see 605579.0001). Everitt et al. (2012) concluded
that, taken together, their data revealed that the action of a single
intrinsic immune effector, IFITM3, profoundly alters the course of
influenza virus infection in mouse and humans.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

At the time of the report by Everitt et al. (2012), 13 nonsynonymous, 13
synonymous, 1 in-frame stop, and 1 splice site acceptor-altering SNPs
had been reported in the IFITM3 sequence.

EVOLUTION

By phylogenetic analysis, Lange et al. (2003) found that only 2 mouse
fragilis genes, fragilis-4 (Ifitm5) and either fragilis (Ifitm3),
fragilis-2 (Ifitm1), or fragilis-3 (Ifitm2), have been conserved from
mouse to human. They suggested that subsequent gene duplications may
have occurred independently in both species.

ANIMAL MODEL

Everitt et al. (2012) used a knockout mouse model developed by Lange et
al. (2008) to test whether the IFITM proteins are critical for intrinsic
resistance to influenza virus. Everitt et al. (2012) observed that mice
lacking Ifitm3 displayed fulminant viral pneumonia when challenged with
a normally low-pathogenicity influenza virus, mirroring the destruction
inflicted by the highly pathogenic 1918 'Spanish' influenza. Similar
increased viral replication was seen in vitro, with protection rescued
by the reintroduction of Ifitm3.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
INFLUENZA, SEVERE, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
IFITM3, 42T-C

In 53 individuals with severe influenza infection (614680) who required
hospitalization as a result of pandemic HIN1/09 or seasonal influenza
virus infection in 2009-2010, Everitt et al. (2012) found enrichment of
a SNP in the IFITM3 gene, the C allele of SNP dbSNP rs12252. Presence of
the C allele results in a synonymous change but alters the first splice
acceptor site and may be associated with an IFITM3 splice variant that
encodes an IFITM3 protein lacking the first 21 amino acids due to the
use of an alternative start codon. When lymphoblastoid cell lines from
CC homozygotes were challenged with influenza A virus, they were far
more susceptible to infection than those of TT homozygotes, and this
vulnerability correlated with lower levels of IFITM3 protein expression
compared to the majority TT variant cells. Everitt et al. (2012) also
found that cells expressing the 21-amino acid deletion protein failed to
restrict viral replication when compared to wildtype IFITM3, consistent
with data showing that the amino-terminal 21 amino acids of IFITM3 are
required for attenuation of vesicular stomatitis virus replication in
vitro (Weidner et al., 2010).

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The ETV6 gene encodes an Ets family transcription factor and is
frequently rearranged or fused with other genes in human leukemias of
myeloid or lymphoid origins (Wang et al., 1997).

CLONING

Golub et al. (1994) identified the ETV6 gene as part of a fusion
transcript resulting from a somatic t(5;12)(q33;p13) translocation in
chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (see 607785) cancer cells. The
translocation was found to consist of a novel gene on chromosome 12p13
and the PDGFRB (173410) gene on 5q33. Golub et al. (1994) isolated
clones corresponding to the coding sequence from a chromosome 12 cDNA
library. Portions of the gene showed homology to the ETS family of
transcription factors, and it was designated 'TEL' for translocation,
ETS, leukemia. Northern blot analysis detected 3 transcripts of 6.5 kb,
4.5 kb, and 2.4 kb in all tissues examined.

Baens et al. (1996) developed contigs containing the complete coding
sequence and the 5-prime and 3-prime UTRs of the ETV6 gene. The
helix-loop-helix (HLH) motif is coded by exons 3 and 4, whereas exons 6
to 8 encode for the ETS DNA-binding domain. The ETV6 gene is flanked at
its 5-prime and 3-prime ends by markers D12S1697 and D12S98,
respectively.

GENE STRUCTURE

Baens et al. (1996) determined that the ETV6 gene contains 8 exons
spanning 240 kb. They identified an alternative exon 1B located within
intron 2.

MAPPING

Stegmaier et al. (1995) mapped the ETV6 gene to chromosome 12p13.

GENE FUNCTION

Stegmaier et al. (1995) presented evidence that the TEL gene may act as
a tumor suppressor gene. They noted noted that 5% of children with acute
lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) have 12p13-p12 deletions. Using markers
flanking the TEL gene, Stegmaier et al. (1995) found that 15% of 81
informative children with ALL had TEL loss of heterozygosity that was
not evident on cytogenetic analysis. Detailed examination showed that
the critically deleted region included 2 candidate suppressor genes: TEL
and KIP (600778), the gene encoding the cyclin-dependent kinase
inhibitor p27.

- ETV6/PDGFRB Fusion Gene

In bone marrow cells from a 17-year-old male with chronic myelomonocytic
leukemia, Golub et al. (1994) identified a somatic t(5;12)(q33;p13)
translocation consisting of the 154 N terminal residues of ETV6 linked
to the transmembrane and tyrosine kinase domains of the PDGFRB on
chromosome 5q33. The entire ligand-binding domain of PDGFRB and the
putative DNA-binding domain of ETV6 were both excluded from the fusion
transcript. This same rearrangement was detected in 3 additional
patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. The index patient
subsequently developed acute myelogenous leukemia (AML; 601626)
associated with other genetic alterations, suggesting that the
t(5;12)(q33;p13) translocation was an early step in a multistep
progression to full AML.

Apperley et al. (2002) reported successful response to therapy with the
tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate in 3 patients with chronic
myeloproliferative disorder (131440) and a t(5;12) translocation. The
patients' leukemic cells carried the ETV6/PDGFRB fusion gene.

Pierce et al. (2008) showed that expression of TEL/PDGFRB in murine
myeloid FDCP-Mix cells prevented cell differentiation, increased cell
survival, increased the level of phosphatidylinositol
3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdInsP3), and increased the expression and
phosphorylation of Thoc5 (612733). Elevated Thoc5 expression also led to
increased cell survival and PtdInsP3 levels, suggesting that the effects
associated with TEL/PDGFRB expression were due, at least in part, to
Thoc5 upregulation.

- ETV6/AML1 Fusion Gene

Golub et al. (1995) documented fusion of TEL to the AML1 gene (151385)
on chromosome 21 in 2 pediatric patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia
with t(12;21) translocations. The findings implicated TEL in the
pathogenesis of leukemia through its fusion to either a receptor
tyrosine kinase, such as PDGFRB, or a transcription factor, such as
AML1.

Using RT-PCR, Romana et al. (1995) identified the TEL/AML1 fusion gene
in 8 (16%) of 46 childhood B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia cells, only 1
of which showed a 12p abnormality by classic cytogenetic techniques. The
authors concluded that t(12;21) is the most frequent translocation in
childhood B-lineage ALL.

Ford et al. (1998) reported the extraordinary case of monozygotic twins
in whom common acute lymphoblastic leukemia was diagnosed at ages 3.5
years and 4 years. The twins' leukemic DNA shared the same unique (or
clonotypic) but nonconstitutive TEL/AML1 fusion sequence. The most
plausible explanation for this finding was thought to be a single cell
origin of the TEL/AML fusion in 1 fetus in utero, probably as a
leukemia-initiating mutation, followed by intraplacental metastasis of
clonal progeny to the other twin. Clonal identity was further supported
by the finding that the leukemic cells in the twins shared an identical
rearranged IGH allele. These data had implications for the etiology and
natural history of childhood leukemia.

- ETV6/MN1 Fusion Gene

Buijs et al. (1995) showed that the MN1 gene (156100) on 22q11 is fused
to the TEL gene in the t(12;22)(p13;q11) translocation that is observed
in different myeloid malignancies.

- ETV6/JAK2 Fusion Gene

Peeters et al. (1997) identified a t(9;12)(p24;p13) translocation in a
patient with early pre-B acute lymphoid leukemia and a
t(9;15;12)(p24;q15;p13) translocation in a patient with atypical chronic
myelogenous leukemia (CML; 608232) in transformation. Both changes
involved the ETV6 gene at 12p13 and the JAK2 gene (147796) at 9p24. In
each case different fusion mRNAs were found, with only 1 resulting in a
chimeric protein consisting of the oligomerization domain of ETV6 and
the protein tyrosine kinase domain of JAK2.

Lacronique et al. (1997) observed a t(9;12)(p24;p13) translocation in
leukemic cells from a 4-year-old boy with T-cell ALL. The 3-prime
portion of the JAK2 gene was fused to the 5-prime portion of the ETV6
gene, resulting in a protein containing the catalytic domain of JAK2 and
the oligomerization domain of ETV6. The resultant protein had
constitutive tyrosine kinase activity and conferred cytokine-independent
proliferation to a murine cell line.

- ETV6/NTRK3 Fusion Gene

Knezevich et al. (1998) detected a recurrent t(12;15)(p13;q25)
translocation consisting of fusion of the ETV6 gene with the NTRK3 gene
(191316) on 15q25 in 3 congenital fibrosarcomas analyzed. Congenital (or
infantile) fibrosarcoma (CFS) is a malignant tumor of fibroblasts that
occurs in patients aged 2 or younger. CFS is unique among human sarcomas
in that it has an excellent prognosis and very low metastatic rate. CFS
is histologically identical to adult-type fibrosarcoma (ATFS); however,
ATFS is an aggressive malignancy of adults and older children that has a
poor prognosis. The same translocation was not identified in ATFS or
infantile fibromatosis (228550), a histologically similar but benign
fibroblastic proliferation occurring in the same age group as CFS.
ETV6/NTRK3 fusion transcripts encoded the HLH protein dimerization
domain of ETV6 fused to the protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) domain of
NTRK3. Presumably, the chimeric protein tyrosine kinase contributed to
oncogenesis by dysregulation of NTRK3 signal transduction pathways.

- ETV6/ACS2 Fusion Gene

Yagasaki et al. (1999) identified a recurrent t(5;12)(q31;p13)
translocation, resulting in an ETV6/ACS2 (604443) fusion gene in a
patient with refractory anemia with excess blasts with basophilia, a
patient with AML with eosinophilia, and a patient with acute
eosinophilic leukemia (AEL). The ETV6/ACS2 fusion transcripts showed an
out-frame fusion of exon 1 of ETV6 to exon 1 of ACS2 in the patient with
AEL, an out-frame fusion of exon 1 of ETV6 to exon 11 of ACS2 in the
patient with AML, and a short in-frame fusion of exon 1 of ETV6 to the
3-prime untranslated region of ACS2 in the patient with refractory
anemia. Reciprocal ACS2/ETV6 transcripts were identified in 2 of the
cases. FISH with ETV6 cosmids on 12p13, and BACs and PIs on 5q31,
demonstrated that the 5q31 breakpoints of the AML and AEL cases involved
the 5-prime portion of the ACS2 gene, and that the 5q31 breakpoint of
the refractory anemia case involved the 3-prime portion of the ACS2
gene. None of the resulting chimeric transcripts except for the
ACS2/ETV6 transcript in the refractory anemia case led to a fusion
protein.

- ETV6/ABL2 Fusion Gene

Cazzaniga et al. (1999) identified a t(1;12)(q25;p13) translocation
involving the ETV6 gene and the ABL2 (164690) gene in a patient with
acute myeloid leukemia M4 with eosinophilia. The novel transcript
resulted in a chimeric protein consisting of the helix-loop-helix
oligomerization domain of ETV6 and the SH2, SH3, and protein tyrosine
kinase domains of ABL2. The reciprocal transcript ABL2/ETV6 was also
detected in the patient's RNA by RT-PCR, although at a lower expression
level.

- ETV6/BTL Fusion Gene

Cools et al. (1999) reported 4 cases of acute myeloid leukemia with very
immature myeloblasts and a t(4;12)(q11-q12;p13) translocation in which
ETV6 was linked with the BTL gene (604332). RT-PCR experiments indicated
that expression of the BTL/ETV6 transcript, but not of the reciprocal
ETV6/BTL transcript, was a common finding in these leukemias. In
contrast to most of the other ETV6 fusions, both the complete
helix-loop-helix and ETS DNA-binding domains of ETV6 were present in the
predicted BTL/ETV6 fusion protein, and a chimeric gene was transcribed
from the BTL promoter.

- ETV6/ARNT Fusion Gene

Salomon-Nguyen et al. (2000) determined that a t(1;12)(q21;p13)
translocation observed in a case of acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML-M2)
resulted in a fusion protein containing the amino-terminal of TEL and
essentially all of the ARNT gene (126110). The involvement of ARNT in
human leukemogenesis had not previously been described.

- ETV6/MDS2 Fusion Gene

Odero et al. (2002) identified a t(1;12)(p36.1;p13) translocation in an
MDS patient that resulted in the fusion of exons 1 and 2 of ETV6 to
exons 6 and 7 of MDS2 (607305). The predicted protein is out of frame
and contains the first 54 amino acids of ETV6 followed by 4 novel amino
acids from the MDS2 sequence. The truncated ETV6 protein lacks critical
functional domains.

- ETV6/PER1 Fusion Gene

Penas et al. (2003) cloned a novel cryptic translocation,
t(12;17)(p13;p12-p13), occurring in a patient with acute myeloid
leukemia evolving from a chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. They
identified a fusion transcript between exon 1 of the ETV6 gene and the
antisense strand of PER1 (602260). The ETV6/PER1 fusion transcript did
not produce a fusion protein, and no other fusion transcripts could be
detected. Penas et al. (2003) hypothesized that in the absence of a
fusion protein, the inactivation of PER1 or deregulation of a gene in
the neighborhood of PER1 may contribute to the pathogenesis of leukemia
with this translocation.

- ETV6/RUNX1 Fusion Gene

Anderson et al. (2011) examined the genetic architecture of cancer at
the subclonal and single-cell level and in cells responsible for cancer
clone maintenance and propagation in childhood acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (see 613065) in which the ETV6/RUNX1 (151385) gene fusion is an
early or initiating genetic lesion followed by a modest number of
recurrent or driver copy number alterations. By multiplexing
fluorescence in situ hybridization probes for these mutations, up to 8
genetic abnormalities could be detected in single cells, a genetic
signature of subclones identified, and a composite picture of subclonal
architecture and putative ancestral trees assembled. Anderson et al.
(2011) observed that subclones in acute lymphoblastic leukemia have
variegated genetics and complex nonlinear or branching evolutionary
histories. Copy number alterations are independently and reiteratively
acquired in subclones of individual patients, and in no preferential
order. Clonal architecture is dynamic and is subject to change in the
lead-up to a diagnosis and in relapse. Leukemia-propagating cells,
assayed by serial transplantation in nonobese diabetic/severe combined
immunodeficiency (NOD/SCID) IL2R-gamma (308380)-null mice, are also
genetically variegated, mirroring subclonal patterns, and vary in
competitive regenerative capacity in vivo.

CYTOGENETICS

Cytogenetic abnormalities involving the short arm of chromosome 12 have
been documented in a wide variety of hematopoietic malignancies,
including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloblastic
leukemia, and myelodysplastic syndromes. Among 20 patients with 12q
deletions or translocations, Kobayashi et al. (1994) showed that most
changes were clustered within a 1.39-Mb region, suggesting that a single
gene on 12p13 was affected in these leukemias.

Raynaud et al. (1996) reported 5 patients with an identical reciprocal
translocation between 3q26 and 12p13. This nonrandom cytogenetic change
was observed in 4 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome rapidly
progressing to acute myeloid leukemia and was found at blast crisis of 1
patient with Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML. The abnormality was
associated with a very poor prognosis. Fluorescence in situ
hybridization with 3q26 and 12p13 probes was performed on metaphases
from these 5 patients. The results were consistent with scattering of
the breakpoints previously described in 3q26 rearrangements. Breakpoints
at 12p13 involved the ETV6 gene in 3 myelodysplastic syndrome cases.

Berger et al. (1997) described 3 novel translocations involving the
TEL/ETV6 gene on chromosome 12: t(X;12)(q28;p13), t(1;12)(q21;p13), and
t(9;12)(p23-24;p13).

Cave et al. (1997) demonstrated that ETV6 is a target of chromosome 12p
deletions in t(12;21) childhood acute lymphocytic leukemia.

Odero et al. (2001) stated that 35 different chromosome bands had been
involved in ETV6 translocations, of which 13 had been cloned. Adding
further data, they concluded that ETV6 is involved in 41 translocations.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Barjesteh van Waalwijk van Doorn-Khosrovani et al. (2005) analyzed 300
patients newly diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML; 601626) for
mutations in the coding region of the ETV6 gene and identified 5 somatic
heterozygous mutations affecting either the homodimerization or the
DNA-binding domain (e.g., 600618.0001 and 600618.0002). These ETV6
mutant proteins were unable to repress transcription and showed
dominant-negative effects. The authors also examined ETV6 protein
expression in 77 patients with AML and found that 24 (31%) lacked the
wildtype 57- and 50-kD proteins; there was no correlation between ETV6
mRNA transcript levels and the loss of ETV6 protein, suggesting
posttranscriptional regulation of ETV6.

HISTORY

- ETV6/ABL1 Fusion Gene

Papadopoulos et al. (1995) identified a case of ALL with a previously
undescribed fusion between the TEL gene and the ABL gene (189980) on
chromosome 9q. The fusion protein showed elevated tyrosine kinase
activity. However, Janssen et al. (1995) did not identify any TEL/ABL
fusion products using RT-PCR to screen 186 adult ALL and 30 childhood
ALL patients. Nilsson et al. (1998) also found no instance of ETV6/ABL
fusion. in a study of a group of 67 cases of chronic myeloid disorders.

ANIMAL MODEL

By gene targeting in mice, Wang et al. (1997) showed that TEL function
is required for viability of the developing mouse. The TEL -/- mice
suffered a yolk sac angiogenic defect; TEL also appeared essential for
the survival of selected neural and mesenchymal populations within the
embryo proper. Wang et al. (1998) generated mouse chimeras with TEL -/-
embryonic stem cells to examine a possible requirement in adult
hematopoiesis. They found that although TEL function is not required for
the intrinsic proliferation and/or differentiation of adult-type
hematopoietic lineages in the yolk sac and fetal liver, it is essential
for the establishment of hematopoiesis of all lineages in the bone
marrow. These findings established TEL as the first transcription factor
required specifically for hematopoiesis within the bone marrow, as
opposed to other sites of hematopoietic activity during development.

STAT5 (see STAT5A, 601511; STAT5B, 604260) is activated in a broad
spectrum of human hematologic malignancies. Using a genetic approach,
Schwaller et al. (2000) addressed whether activation of STAT5 is
necessary for the myelo- and lymphoproliferative disease induced by the
TEL/JAK2 (147796) fusion gene. Whereas mice transplanted with bone
marrow transduced with retrovirus expressing TEL/JAK2 developed a
rapidly fatal myelo- and lymphoproliferative syndrome, reconstitution
with bone marrow derived from Stat5a/b-deficient mice expressing
TEL/JAK2 did not induce disease. Disease induction in the
Stat5a/b-deficient background was rescued with a bicistronic retrovirus
encoding TEL/JAK2 and Stat5a. Furthermore, myeloproliferative disease
was induced by reconstitution with bone marrow cells expressing a
constitutively active mutant, Stat5a, or a single Stat5a target, murine
oncostatin M (OSM; 165095). These data defined a critical role for
STAT5A/B and OSM in the pathogenesis of TEL/JAK2 disease.

Montpetit and Sinnett (2001) reported a comparative analysis of the ETV6
gene in vertebrate genomes. They cloned the homolog of ETV6 from the
compact genome of the pufferfish Fugu rubripes. In that organism the
gene, composed of 8 exons, spans about 15 kb and is 16 times smaller
than its human counterpart, mainly because of reduced intron size. Three
of the 7 introns were unusually large (more than 2 kb). As expected, the
PNT and ETS domains were highly conserved from Fugu to human. There were
also conserved putative regulatory elements in the promoter as well as
in the large intron 2 of Fugu ETV6.

Creation of the TEL/AML1 fusion disrupts 1 copy of the TEL gene and 1
copy of the AML1 gene; loss of 1 or the other is associated with cases
of acute leukemia without the presence of the TEL/AML1 fusion gene. To
determine if TEL/AML1 can contribute to leukemogenesis, Bernardin et al.
(2002) transduced marrow from C57BL/6 mice with a retroviral vector
expressing TEL/AML1 or with a control vector. Two of the 9 TEL/AML1 mice
developed ALL, whereas none of the 20 control mice developed leukemia.
Bernardin et al. (2002) also used the TEL/AML1 vector to transduce
marrow from C57BL/6 mice lacking the overlapping p16(INK4a)p19(ARF)
genes (600160) and transplanted the cells into wildtype recipients. No
control mice died, but 6 of 8 TEL/AML1/p16p19 mice died with leukemia.
These findings indicated that TEL/AML1 contributes to leukemogenesis and
may cooperate with loss of p16p19 to transform lymphoid progenitors.

Tsuzuki et al. (2004) analyzed hemopoiesis in mice syngeneically
transplanted with TEL/AML1-transduced bone marrow stem cells. TEL/AML1
expression was associated with an accumulation/expansion of primitive
Kit (164920)-positive multipotent progenitors and a modest increase in
myeloid colony-forming cells. TEL/AML1 expression was, however,
permissive for myeloid differentiation. Analysis of B lymphopoiesis
revealed an increase in early pro-B cells but a differentiation deficit
beyond that stage, which resulted in lower B-cell production in the
marrow. TEL/AML1-positive B-cell progenitors exhibited reduced
expression of genes crucial for the pro-B to pre-B cell transition.

ETV6, GLU76TER

In leukemic blast cells of a patient with acute myeloid leukemia
(601626), Barjesteh van Waalwijk van Doorn-Khosrovani et al. (2005)
identified a somatic heterozygous 500G-T transversion in the ETV6 gene,
resulting in a glu76-to-ter (E76X) substitution in the N-terminal
pointed (PNT) homodimerization domain. The mutant protein was unable to
repress transcription and showed dominant-negative effects. The mutation
was not found in nonhematopoietic tissue from this patient.

In leukemic blast cells of a patient with acute myeloid leukemia
(601626), Barjesteh van Waalwijk van Doorn-Khosrovani et al. (2005)
identified a somatic heterozygous 3-bp insertion (1307insGGG) in the
ETV6 gene, resulting in the insertion of a glycine between codons 344
and 345 in the DNA binding domain. The mutant protein was unable to
repress transcription and showed dominant-negative effects.

600327	TITLE *600327 SYNAPTOTAGMIN 3; SYT3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Synaptotagmin-1 (SYT1; 185605), an integral membrane protein of synaptic
vesicles, is thought to be involved in calcium-dependent exocytosis of
synaptic vesicles. Mizuta et al. (1994) cloned a novel isoform of
synaptotagmin, designated synaptotagmin-3, from a rat brain cDNA library
and studied its tissue distribution. The protein contains 588 amino
acids having 40.5, 38.3, and 64.0% identity with rat synaptotagmin-1,
rat synaptotagmin-2 (SYT2; 600104), and a third synaptotagmin isoform of
the marine ray, respectively. The region of the 2 internal repeats
homologous to the regulatory domain of protein kinase C was highly
conserved among the 3 synaptotagmins. RNA blot studies demonstrated that
synaptotagmin-3 mRNA is expressed in brain, various endocrine tissues,
and hormone-secreting clonal cells. It appeared to be involved in
Ca(2+)-dependent exocytosis of secretory vesicles in endocrine cells, as
well as in neurons.

GENE FUNCTION

By in vitro characterization of recombinant rat Syt3, Li et al. (1995)
determined that Syt3 showed Ca(2+)-dependent binding to phospholipids,
Ca(2+)-dependent binding to syntaxins (see 186590), and
Ca(2+)-independent binding to adaptor protein-2 (see 601026).

MAPPING

Using an interspecific backcross DNA panel, Jones et al. (1995)
demonstrated that the mouse Syt3 gene is located on mouse chromosome 7;
no recombinants were observed between Syt3 and the kallikrein gene
family (Kal) in 94 meioses. To map human SYT3, they probed a Southern
blot containing genomic DNAs from a somatic cell mapping panel and found
segregation with chromosome 19. Thus, SYT3 appears to be located in the
conserved linkage group on proximal mouse chromosome 7 and human
chromosome 19q that is known to include at least 28 genes (Holdener et
al., 1993). Kwon et al. (1995) likewise mapped Syt3 to mouse chromosome
7.

605864	TITLE *605864 BETA-1,3-N-ACETYLGLUCOSAMINYLTRANSFERASE 4; B3GNT4
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Beta-1,3-galactosyltransferases (B3GALTs; see 603018) catalyze the
formation of type I oligosaccharides. By searching EST databases for
sequences similar to B3GALTs, Shiraishi et al. (2001) isolated cDNAs
encoding B3GNT4, TMEM3 (605863), which they designated B3GNT3, and
B3GNT2 (605581). Sequence analysis predicted that B3GNT4 is a 378-amino
acid type II transmembrane protein that contains an N-terminal
cytoplasmic domain of either 29 or 4 residues due to the presence of 2
initiation codons; a 20-residue transmembrane segment; and a 329-residue
stem region and catalytic domain with 3 potential N-linked glycosylation
sites. Western blot analysis indicated that FLAG-fused B3GNT4 was
expressed as an approximately 38- to 40-kD glycoprotein. Functional
analysis showed that B3GNT4 is a beta-1,3-N
acetylglucosaminyltransferase with a preferred substrate of
lacto-N-neotetraose, and that it is involved in the biosynthesis of
poly-N-acetyllactosamine sugar chains. RT-PCR analysis detected
expression mainly in brain, including hippocampus, amygdala, cerebellum,
and caudate nucleus, as well as in colon, esophagus, and kidney;
expression was not detected in colon cancer, lymphoma, or promyelocytic
leukemia cell lines.

MAPPING

Using ESTs, Shiraishi et al. (2001) mapped the B3GNT4 gene to chromosome
12.

158120	TITLE *158120 MONOCYTE DIFFERENTIATION ANTIGEN CD14; CD14
;;MYELOID CELL-SPECIFIC LEUCINE-RICH GLYCOPROTEIN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CD14 is a single-copy gene encoding 2 protein forms: a 50- to 55-kD
glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored membrane protein (mCD14) and a
monocyte or liver-derived soluble serum protein (sCD14) that lacks the
anchor. Both molecules are critical for lipopolysaccharide
(LPS)-dependent signal transduction, and sCD14 confers LPS sensitivity
to cells lacking mCD14. Increased sCD14 levels are associated with
inflammatory infectious diseases and high mortality in gram-negative
shock (LeVan et al., 2001).

CLONING

Differentiation of myelomonocytic cells from pluripotent stem cells to
mature functioning monocytes/macrophages and granulocytes is accompanied
by a variety of changes, including the expression of new cell surface
antigens. One of these antigens, CD14, a 55-kD glycoprotein, is
preferentially expressed on the surface of mature cells of the monocytic
lineage. Goyert et al. (1988) isolated a cDNA clone encoding CD14 and
isolated the CD14 gene.

Ferrero et al. (1990) demonstrated that, as in man, the expression of
murine CD14 is limited to the myeloid lineage. In both mouse and man,
the CD14 protein contains leucine-rich motif that is repeated 10 times.

GENE FUNCTION

The expression profile of CD14, as well as its inclusion in the family
of leucine-rich proteins and the chromosomal location of other receptor
genes, supports the hypothesis that CD14 functions as a receptor. Its
receptor function was indeed demonstrated by Wright (1990) who showed
that it is a receptor for the lipopolysaccharide-binding
protein:lipopolysaccharide complex (LBP; 151990:LPS); also see Wright et
al. (1990). Gupta et al. (1996) transfected mouse 70Z/3 cells with human
CD14 and showed that these cells were responsive to peptidoglycan (PGN),
a polymer of alternating GlcNAc and MurNAc cross-linked by short
peptides, that is present in the cell walls of all bacteria, but is
particularly abundant in gram-positive bacteria. They concluded that
CD14 serves as a cell-activating receptor not only for LPS but also for
PGN.

Cells undergoing programmed cell death (apoptosis) are cleared rapidly
in vivo by phagocytes without inducing inflammation. Devitt et al.
(1998) showed that the glycoprotein CD14 on the surface of human
macrophages is important for the recognition and clearance of apoptotic
cells. CD14 can also act as a receptor that binds bacterial LPS,
triggering inflammatory responses. Overstimulation of CD14 by LPS can
cause the often fatal toxic-shock syndrome. Devitt et al. (1998) showed
that apoptotic cells interact with CD14, triggering phagocytosis of the
apoptotic cells. This interaction depends on a region of CD14 that is
identical to, or at least closely associated with, a region known to
bind LPS. However, apoptotic cells, unlike LPS, do not provoke the
release of proinflammatory cytokines from macrophages. These results
indicated that clearance of apoptotic cells is mediated by a receptor
whose interactions with 'nonself' components (LPS) and 'self' components
(apoptotic cells) produce distinct macrophage responses.

Savill (1998) summarized understanding of how ced-5 (see DOCK1; 601403)
and CD14 together with other molecules function in the engulfment of
cell corpses by macrophages in the process of programmed cell death. The
model incorporated the newly proposed functions of ced-5 and CD14.

LPS interacts with LBP and CD14 to present LPS to TLR4 (603030), which
activates inflammatory gene expression through NF-kappa-B (see 164011)
and MAPK signaling. Bochkov et al. (2002) demonstrated that oxidized
phospholipids inhibit LPS-induced but not TNF-alpha (191160)-induced or
interleukin-1-beta (147720)-induced NF-kappa-B-mediated upregulation of
inflammatory genes, by blocking the interaction of LPS with LBP and
CD14. Moreover, in LPS-injected mice, oxidized phospholipids inhibited
inflammation and protected mice from lethal endotoxin shock. Thus, in
severe gram-negative bacterial infection, endogenously formed oxidized
phospholipids may function as a negative feedback to blunt innate immune
responses. Furthermore, Bochkov et al. (2002) identified chemical
structures capable of inhibiting the effects of endotoxins such as LPS
that could be used for the development of new drugs for treatment of
sepsis.

Children of farmers are at decreased risk of developing allergies.
Results of epidemiologic studies suggested that increased exposure to
microbial compounds might be responsible for this reduced risk.
Alterations in adaptive immune response were thought to be the
underlying mechanism. Lauener et al. (2002) measured the expression of
receptors for microbial compounds known to trigger the innate immune
response. They showed that blood cells from farmers' children expressed
significantly higher amounts of CD14 and Toll-like receptor-2 (TLR2;
603028) than those from non-farmers' children. They proposed that the
innate immune system responds to the microbial burden in the environment
and modulates the development of allergic disease.

Zanoni et al. (2009) found that stimulation of murine bone
marrow-derived dendritic cells (DCs) with LPS induced Src (190090)
kinase and Plcg2 (600220) activation, Ca(2+) influx, and calcineurin
(see 114105)-dependent nuclear Nfat (see 600490) translocation.
Induction of this pathway was Tlr4 independent and entirely dependent on
Cd14. Nfat activation was necessary for apoptotic death of terminally
differentiated DCs, allowing for maintenance of self-tolerance and
prevention of autoimmunity. Blocking this pathway in vivo resulted in
prolonged DC survival and an increase in T-cell priming capability.
Zanoni et al. (2009) concluded that CD14 is involved, through NFAT
activation, in regulation of the DC life cycle.

By coimmunoprecipitation and confocal microscopic analysis, Baumann et
al. (2010) showed that CD14 interacted with TLR7 (300365) and TLR9
(605474) in mouse and human cells and was required for TLR7- and
TLR9-dependent induction of proinflammatory cytokines. Cd14 was required
for Tlr9-dependent immune responses in mice and for optimal nucleic acid
uptake in mouse macrophages. Cd14 was dispensable for viral uptake in
mice, but it was required for triggering of TLR-dependent cytokine
responses. Baumann et al. (2010) concluded that CD14 has a dual role in
nucleic acid-mediated TLR activation by promoting selective uptake of
nucleic acids and acting as a coreceptor for endosomal TLR activation.

Using flow cytometry and confocal microscopy in mouse cells, Zanoni et
al. (2011) demonstrated that Cd14 chaperoned LPS to Tlr4, leading to Syk
(600085)-dependent internalization of Tlr4 and signaling through Trif
(607601). Zanoni et al. (2011) concluded that pathogen recognition
receptors induce both membrane transport and signal transduction.

Shirey et al. (2013) reported that CD14 and TLR2 are required for
protection against influenza-induced lethality in mice mediated by
Eritoran (also known as E5564), a potent, well-tolerated, synthetic TLR4
antagonist. Therapeutic administration of Eritoran blocked
influenza-induced lethality in mice, as well as lung pathology, clinical
symptoms, cytokine and oxidized phospholipid expression, and decreased
viral titers. CD14 directly binds Eritoran and inhibits ligand binding
to MD2 (605243). Shirey et al. (2013) concluded that Eritoran blockade
of TLR signaling represents a novel therapeutic approach for
inflammation associated with influenza, and possibly other infections.

MAPPING

Goyert et al. (1988) demonstrated by in situ hybridization and study of
somatic cell hybrid DNA that the gene is located at bands 5q23-q31.
Thus, CD14 is located in a region of chromosome 5 that contains a
cluster of genes that encode several myeloid-specific growth factors
(IL3; 147740) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor
(CSF2; 138960) or growth factor receptors (FMS receptor for CFS1;
164770), as well as other growth factor and receptor genes
(platelet-derived growth factor receptor, 173410, beta-2-adrenergic
receptor, 109690, and endothelial cell growth factor, 131220). This is a
region that is deleted in patients with certain forms of myeloid
leukemia.

Ferrero et al. (1990) mapped the CD14 gene to mouse chromosome 18.

By fluorescence in situ hybridization studies of deleted chromosome 5
homologs in a series of 135 patients with malignant myeloid diseases, Le
Beau et al. (1993) mapped the CD14 gene and neighboring genes to 5q31.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Baldini et al. (1999) identified a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
in the proximal CD14 promoter at position -159 from the transcription
start site, resulting in a C-to-T transition. TT homozygotes had
significantly higher levels of sCD14 than did either CC or CT genotype
carriers, and they also had lower levels of IgE. Unkelbach et al.
(1999), Hubacek et al. (1999), and Shimada et al. (2000) reported an
increased risk of myocardial infarction in individuals carrying the T
allele. (Shimada et al. (2000) and Hubacek et al. (1999) reported the
C/T polymorphism as occurring at position -260 from the translation
start site.)

Some patients with Kawasaki disease (KD), an acute febrile vasculitis of
childhood, develop coronary artery lesions after the acute phase.
Nishimura et al. (2003) found no difference in genomic and allele
frequencies of the T allele at the CD14/-159 promoter region in 67
patients with KD compared to controls. However, the KD patients with TT
genotypes had more coronary artery complications than those with CT or
CC genotypes, and the frequency of the T allele was significantly higher
than that of the C allele in KD patients. Nishimura et al. (2003)
concluded that the T allele and the TT genotype are risk factors for the
coronary artery complications in patients with KD, implicating a
possible relationship to the magnitude of the CD14 toll-like receptor
response.

Using EMSA analysis, LeVan et al. (2001) showed that the T allele at
position -159 in the proximal CD14 promoter has a decreased affinity for
DNA/protein interactions at a GC box containing a binding site for SP1
(189906), SP2 (601801), and SP3 (601804) transcription factors. Reporter
analysis demonstrated that monocytic cells with low levels of SP3, which
inhibits activating by SP1 and SP2, have increased transcriptional
activity of the T allele. In contrast, both the C and T alleles are
transcribed equivalently in SP3-rich hepatocytes. LeVan et al. (2001)
proposed that the interplay between CD14 promoter affinity and the
SP3:SP1-plus-SP2 ratio plays a critical mechanistic role in regulating
CD14 transcription and in determining the differential activity of the 2
variants of the CD14 promoter.

In a study of 216 Korean patients with IgA nephropathy (161950) who were
followed for 86 months, Yoon et al. (2003) found that an excess of the
-159C genotype occurred in patients with progressive disease (p = 0.03)
and the risk of disease progression increased as the number of C alleles
increased (p for trend = 0.002). The hazard ratio for progression in
patients with the CC genotype was 3.2 (p = 0.025) compared to patients
with the TT genotype. After lipopolysaccharide stimulation, soluble CD14
was released more abundantly from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells
of TT patients than from those of CC patients (p = 0.006), although
there was no difference in membrane-bound CD14 expression. TT patients
released less IL6 (147620) than CC patients after stimulation (p =
0.0003). Yoon et al. (2003) suggested that the CD14 -159 polymorphism is
an important marker for the progression of IgA nephropathy and may
modulate the level of the inflammatory response.

ANIMAL MODEL

Haziot et al. (1996) reported that Cd14-deficient mice were resistant to
LPS-induced shock.

Kurt-Jones et al. (2000) determined that proinflammatory cytokine
responses to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) F protein were absent or
diminished in mice with deletions of either Cd14 or Tlr4 (603030),
respectively. Importantly, Tlr4 -/- mice had higher levels of infectious
virus in their lungs and were either unable to clear the virus or
cleared the virus several days later than wildtype mice. The authors
concluded that TLR4 and CD14 appear to be important not only in
recognizing bacterial structures such as lipopolysaccharide, but are
important in innate immune responses to viruses as well.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

One of the major mediators of the inborn or 'natural' immune system is
the natural killer (NK) cell. Dixon et al. (1993) prepared a subtractive
cDNA library from human NK cells and characterized 13 unique clones. A
clone named B2-1 was highly expressed in both NK and T cells, but was
very weakly expressed or absent in several other cell lines. The deduced
protein was highly homologous to the yeast protein SEC7, which is
located in the Golgi apparatus and is thought to be involved in
transporting proteins through the Golgi complex. B2-1 was the only known
human protein with significant homology to SEC7 and may be one of the
human equivalents of the yeast secretory proteins.

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a T-cell leukemia cell line with the
intracellular portion of CD18 (ITGB2; 600065) as bait, Kolanus et al.
(1996) isolated a cDNA encoding cytohesin-1 (PSCD1) and a partial cDNA
encoding PSCD2L (602488), which they designated cts18.1. PSCD1 is 88%
identical to the PSCD2L fragment. The predicted 398-amino acid PSCD1
protein contains a central 200-residue SEC7 domain and a C-terminal
pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. Western blot analysis showed expression
of a 47-kD protein, particularly, but not exclusively, in lymphoid
cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Kolanus et al. (1996) found that overexpression of a full-length PSCD1
protein or of the SEC7 domain only induced CD18-dependent binding to
ICAM1 (147840), whereas the PSCD1 PH domain specifically inhibited
adhesion. Binding analysis indicated that the SEC7 domain, but not the
PH domain, interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of CD18 but not with
other cell surface receptors or protein-tyrosine kinases tested. Kolanus
et al. (1996) concluded that PSCD1 specifically regulates the adhesive
function of beta-2 integrins in lymphocytes.

The induction of a transformed cellular phenotype by viruses requires
the modulation of signaling pathways through viral proteins. Kliche et
al. (2001) showed that the phenotypic changes induced by the kaposin A
protein of human herpesvirus-8 are mediated through its direct
interaction with cytohesin-1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF)
for ARF GTPases (e.g., ARF1; 103180) and regulator of integrin-mediated
cell adhesion. Focus formation, stress fiber dissolution, and activation
of the ERK1 (601795)/ERK2 (176948) mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK) signal cascade were reverted by a cytohesin-1 glu157-to-lys
mutant, which is deficient in catalyzing guanine nucleotide exchange.
Furthermore, liposome-embedded kaposin A was found to specifically
stimulate cytohesin-1-dependent GTP binding of myristoylated ARF1 in
vitro.

Hafner et al. (2006) used an aptamer displacement screen to identify
SecinH3, a small Sec7 domain-specific molecular antagonist of
cytohesins. The cytohesins are a class of BFA-resistant small GEFs for
ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs), which regulate cytoskeletal
organization, integrin activation, or integrin signaling. The
application of SecinH3 in human liver cells showed that insulin receptor
complex-associated cytohesins are required for insulin signaling.
SecinH3-treated mice showed increased expression of gluconeogenic genes,
reduced expression of glycolytic, fatty acid, and ketone body metabolism
genes in the liver, reduced liver glycogen stores, and a compensatory
increase in plasma insulin. Thus, Hafner et al. (2006) concluded that
cytohesin inhibition results in hepatic insulin resistance.

Vitale et al. (2000) found that cytohesin-1 interacted with ARF domain
protein-1 (ARD1, or TRIM23; 601747) in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a
human liver cDNA library. ARD1-GDP interacted well with cytohesin-1 but
poorly with cytohesin-2 (PSCD2; 602488), and cytohesin-1 accelerated
binding of a nonhydrolyzable GTP analog to ARD1. Mutation analysis
showed that the effector region of the ARF domain of ARD1 interacted
with the Sec7 domain of cytohesin-1. Physical association between these
domains was highly dependent on experimental conditions, and a free
Mg(2+) concentration that favored nucleotide release from ARD1 and
accumulation of the nucleotide-free ARD1 form also favored interaction
between ARD1 and cytohesin-1. In transfected COS-7 cells, cytohesin-1
was distributed throughout the cell and was also present in the nucleus.
ARD1 associated with vesicular structures concentrated around the
nucleus and scattered throughout the cytoplasm, corresponding to Golgi
and lysosomes, respectively. A constitutively GDP-bound form of ARD1
showed a similar distribution, whereas a constitutively GTP-bound form
of ARD1 was concentrated close to the nucleus in a Golgi-like
distribution only. When ARD1 or its GDP- and GTP-bound forms were
coexpressed with cytohesin-1, only the GDP-bound form showed any change
in distribution or colocalization with cytohesin-1. In 90% of cells
coexpressing the proteins, the GDP-bound form of ARD1 was distributed
throughout the cell, except for the nucleus, and largely colocalized
with cytohesin-1. In less than 10% of cells coexpressing the proteins,
the GDP-bound form of ARD1 and cytohesin-1 colocalized in lysosomes.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Ogasawara et al. (2000) determined that
the PSCD1 gene contains at least 14 exons, including a 3-bp exon 10 also
present in PSCD2 and PSCD3 (605081) but not in PSCD4 (606514) that
results in the insertion of a single glycine into the variable loop
between the first and second beta sheets in the pleckstrin homology
domain.

MAPPING

Dixon et al. (1993) showed by PCR analysis of a human/rodent hybrid
panel that the B2-1 gene is located on chromosome 17. Fluorescence in
situ hybridization localized the gene to 17q25.

612603	TITLE *612603 LATE CORNIFIED ENVELOPE PROTEIN 1A; LCE1A
;;LATE ENVELOPE PROTEIN 1; LEP1
LATE CORNIFIED ENVELOPE GENE CLUSTER, INCLUDED;;
LCE GENE CLUSTER, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

LCE1A belongs to the late cornified envelope (LCE) gene cluster within
the epidermal differentiation complex (EDC) on chromosome 1. The LCE
cluster contains multiple conserved genes that encode stratum corneum
proteins, and these genes are expressed relatively late during fetal
assembly of the skin cornified envelope (Jackson et al., 2005). For
further information on the LCE gene cluster, see GENE FAMILY below.

CLONING

By database analysis to identify human orthologs of mouse genes encoding
late envelope proteins (LEPs), Marshall et al. (2001) identified human
LCE1A, which they called LEP1. RT-PCR analysis detected LEP1 in human
skin, but not in heart or esophagus. In situ hybridization of mouse
embryos showed that group 1 LEP genes, such as Lep1, were expressed just
before barrier formation in the epidermal barrier formation pattern.

Using real-time PCR, Jackson et al. (2005) found that LCE1A, like other
LCE1 genes, was predominantly expressed in human fetal, arm, penal, and
abdominal skin. Little to no LCE1A expression was detected in vulva,
tongue, and esophagus.

GENE FUNCTION

Jackson et al. (2005) showed that expression of LCE1 genes, including
LCE1A, was upregulated in cultured normal human keratinocytes by
ultraviolet irradiation, but not by calcium.

GENE STRUCTURE

Jackson et al. (2005) determined that the LCE1A gene, like most LCE
genes, contains 2 exons. Exon 1 is noncoding.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Marshall et al. (2001) mapped the LCE1A
gene within the LCE gene cluster on chromosome 1q21. Jackson et al.
(2005) stated that the mouse Lce1a gene maps to a syntenic LCE gene
cluster on chromosome 3F1.

GENE FAMILY

- LCE Gene Cluster

Jackson et al. (2005) stated that the LCE gene cluster spans over 320 kb
within the EDC on chromosome 1q21 and can be divided into 3 gene groups,
designated LCE1, LCE2, and LCE3, based on chromosomal position and
protein homology. The LCE1, LCE2, and LCE3 subclusters are interspersed
with 2 individual LCE genes, LCE4A (612618) and LCE5A (612619), 4 LCE
pseudogenes, and several non-LCE genes. The LCE genes appear to have
arisen by gene amplification. Using real-time PCR, Jackson et al. (2005)
found that the LCE1 and LCE2 genes were expressed in skin, whereas the
LCE3 genes showed low-level, tissue-specific expression in all
barrier-forming epithelia tested, including internal epithelia. The LCE
genes responded in a group-specific manner to calcium and ultraviolet
light, with calcium causing upregulation of LCE2 genes, and ultraviolet
light causing upregulation of LCE1 and LCE2 genes.

De Guzman Strong et al. (2010) used a computational approach to identify
conserved noncoding elements (CNEs) in the EDC queried for regulatory
function. Coordinate expression of EDC genes during mouse embryonic skin
development and a striking degree of synteny and linearity in the EDC
locus across a wide range of mammalian (placental and marsupial) genomes
suggested an evolutionary conserved regulatory milieu in the EDC. CNEs
identified by comparative genomics exhibited dynamic regulatory activity
(enhancer or repressor) in differentiating or proliferating conditions.
Epidermal-specific, developmental in vivo enhancer activities (DNaseI
and transgenic mouse assays) were demonstrated in CNEs, including one
within the psoriasis-associated LCE3C (612615)_LCE3B (612614) deletion
(see 603935).

120650	TITLE *120650 COMPLEMENT COMPONENT RECEPTOR 2; CR2
;;COMPLEMENT COMPONENT 3d RECEPTOR; C3DR;;
EPSTEIN-BARR VIRUS RECEPTOR;;
EBV RECEPTOR;;
CD21
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Complement component receptor-2 (CR2, CD21) is the membrane protein on B
lymphocytes to which the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) binds during infection
of these cells. See also CR1 (120620). Yefenof et al. (1976) found
complete overlapping of EBV receptors and C3 (120700) receptors on human
B lymphocytes.

CD21, together with CD19 (107265), CD81 (186845), and CD225 (IFITM1;
604456), forms the B-cell coreceptor complex, which lowers the
activation threshold of the B-cell antigen receptor (summary by Thiel et
al., 2012).

CLONING

Rodriguez de Cordoba and Rubinstein (1986) demonstrated that
quantitative variations of the C3b/C4b receptor (CR1) in human
erythrocytes are controlled by genes within the regulator of complement
activation (RCA) gene cluster. Rodriguez de Cordoba and Rubinstein
(1986) symbolized this gene as C3bRQ. Moore et al. (1987) presented the
nucleotide and derived amino acid sequence of the CR2 gene. They pointed
out the close similarity to CR1 and to factor H, which are closely
linked loci in 1q32.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Szakonyi et al. (2001) described the x-ray structure of CR2 in complex
with its ligand C3d at 2.0 angstroms. The structure revealed extensive
main chain interactions between C3d and only 1 short consensus repeat
(SCR) of CR2 and substantial SCR side-to-side packing.

The 2 N-terminal SCRs (SCR1-SCR2) of CD21 interact with the EBV
glycoprotein gp350/220 and also with the natural CD21 ligand, C3d. Prota
et al. (2002) described the crystal structure of the CD21 SCR1-SCR2
fragment in the absence of ligand and demonstrated that it is able to
bind EBV. Based on a functional analysis of wildtype and mutant CD21 and
molecular modeling, they identified a likely region for EBV attachment
and demonstrated that this region is not involved in the interaction
with C3d. A comparison with the structure of CD21 SCR1-SCR2 in complex
with C3d showed that, in both cases, CD21 assumes compact V-shaped
conformations. However, the analysis revealed a surprising degree of
flexibility at the SCR1-SCR2 interface, suggesting that the interactions
between the 2 domains are not specific.

GENE FUNCTION

Using surface plasmon resonance analysis and ELISA, Asokan et al. (2006)
showed that IFNA (IFNA1; 147660) bound CR2 in the same affinity range as
the CR2 ligands EBV-gp350, C3d/iC3b, and CD23 (FCER2; 151445). IFNA
interacted with SCR1 and SCR2 within the same region of CR2 that serves
as the binding site for the other CR2 ligands. Treatment of B cells with
anti-CR2 diminished induction of IFNA-responsive genes. Asokan et al.
(2006) proposed that the roles of CR2 and IFNA in development of
autoimmunity may be mechanistically linked to pathogenesis of systemic
lupus erythematosus (SLE; 152700).

MAPPING

Weis et al. (1987) demonstrated by Southern analysis of DNA from somatic
cell hybrids and by in situ hybridization using partial cDNA clones that
the CR2 gene is located on band 1q32.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Susceptibility to Systemic Lupus Erythematosis

Wu et al. (2007) found evidence of linkage at chromosome 1q32.2 in a
targeted genome scan of 1q21-q43 in 126 SLE multiplex families (see
SLEB9, 610927) containing 151 affected sib pairs (nonparametric linkage
score, 2.52; p = 0.006). The authors then analyzed the CR2 gene in 1,416
individuals from 258 Caucasian and 142 Chinese SLE simplex families and
demonstrated that a common 3-SNP haplotype (120650.0001) was associated
with SLE susceptibility (p = 0.00001) with a 1.54-fold increased risk
for development of disease. Wu et al. (2007) concluded that the CR2 gene
is likely a susceptibility gene for SLE.

- Common Variable Immunodeficiency-7

In a patient with a mild form of combined variable immunodeficiency-7
(CVID7; 614699), Thiel et al. (2012) identified compound heterozygous
mutations in the CD21 gene (120650.0002 and 120650.0003). Both mutations
caused functionally null alleles, with lack of CD21 expression on the
patient's B cells. The patient had hypogammaglobulinemia and recurrent
infections. However, antibodies against recall antigens, such as
measles, mumps, and varicella, were normal, and he had antibodies
against EBV, suggesting that CD21 is not absolutely required for EBV
entry. The B cells showed a mature antigen phenotype, but there was a
reduction in class-switched memory B cells. Together with the
demonstrated defects in CD19 (107265) and CD81 (186845), this CD21
deficiency was the third genetic defect affecting the B-cell coreceptor
complex in humans. All 3 defects share the features of severely
decreased memory B-cell numbers, hypogammaglobulinemia, and recurrent
infections.

ANIMAL MODEL

Fairweather et al. (2006) found that mice deficient in both Cr1 and Cr2
had increased acute myocarditis and pericardial fibrosis due to
coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), leading to early progression to dilated
cardiomyopathy and heart failure. Increased inflammation was not
associated with increased viral replication. Immunofluorescence
microscopy demonstrated increased numbers of macrophages, higher Il1b
(147720) levels, and immune complex deposition in the heart. The mouse
complement regulatory protein, Crry, was increased in cardiac
macrophages, while immature B cells were increased in mutant mice after
CVB3 infection. Fairweather et al. (2006) concluded that CR1/CR2
expression is not necessary for CVB3 clearance, but it is involved in
protection against immune-mediated damage to the heart.

Wu et al. (2007) analyzed the CR2 gene in 1,416 individuals from 258
Caucasian and 142 Chinese SLE simplex (610927) families and demonstrated
that the major allele 3-SNP haplotype (+21T-C, dbSNP rs3813946; a
synonymous G-A SNP, dbSNP rs1048971; and a G-A SNP resulting in an S639N
substitution, dbSNP rs17615) was associated with SLE susceptibility (p =
0.00001) with a 1.54-fold increased risk for development of disease.
Studies using luciferase constructs revealed that the +21T-C SNP located
in the 5-prime untranslated region alters transcriptional activity.

IMMUNODEFICIENCY, COMMON VARIABLE, 7
CR2, IVS6DS, G-C, +1

In a 28-year-old man with common variable immunodeficiency-7 (CVID7;
614699), Thiel et al. (2012) identified compound heterozygosity for 2
mutations in the CR2 gene: a G-to-C transversion in the donor site of
exon 6 (1225+1G-C), resulting in the in-frame skipping of exon 6, and a
2297G-A transition in exon 13, resulting in a trp766-to-ter (W766X;
120650.0003) substitution, which was demonstrated to result in
nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. The splice site mutation resulted in a
shorter mRNA that putatively codes for a truncated CD21 protein
predicted to lack the extracellular short consensus repeats 5 and 6.
Each unaffected parent was heterozygous for 1 of the mutations, neither
of which were found in 100 controls. Transfection of the mutations in
293T cells showed absence of CD21 expression at the cell surface,
consistent with complete absence of CD21 on the patient's B cells. The
patient had recurrent infections, splenomegaly, and
hypogammaglobulinemia affecting mainly IgG. IgA values were slightly
reduced and IgM levels were low-normal. Antibodies against recall
antigens, such as measles, mumps, and varicella, were normal, and he had
antibodies against EBV, suggesting that CD21 is not absolutely required
for EBV entry. The B cells showed a mature antigen phenotype, but there
was a reduction in class-switched memory B cells. Patient B cells showed
reduced binding to a C3d (see 120700)-containing immune complex and to
EBV compared to control cells, and also showed no costimulatory activity
via the B-cell receptor complex. Patient cells showed normal
proliferative response and production of immunoglobulin upon stimulation
with anti-IgM and anti-CD40 (109535), and the patient mounted a normal
antibody response to protein vaccination, although his response to
pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccination was somewhat impaired.

;;INTERLEUKIN 1 FAMILY, MEMBER 9; IL1F9;;
INTERLEUKIN 1 HOMOLOG 1; IL1H1;;
INTERLEUKIN 1-RELATED PROTEIN 2; IL1RP2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the IL1 (see IL1A; 147760) family, such as IL1F9, are
structurally related cytokines and cell surface receptors that mediate
inflammation. IL1F9 is part of an IL1 signaling system in epithelia and
has proinflammatory properties (summary by Johnston et al., 2011).

CLONING

By searching EST databases for IL1 homologs, Kumar et al. (2000)
identified a cDNA encoding IL1H1. The deduced 169-amino acid protein,
which shares 19 to 32% sequence similarity with other IL1 family
members, lacks a hydrophobic leader peptide and a prodomain. Biophysical
analyses indicated that IL1H1 has 12 beta strands, similar to other IL1
family members. Northern blot analysis detected no expression of IL1H1
in a multiple tissue blot. PCR analysis detected low levels of
expression in lungs and macrophages. RT-PCR and Western blot analyses
showed that cytokine-induced keratinocytes expressed readily detectable
IL1H1. In situ hybridization analysis demonstrated IL1H1 expression in
keratinocytes in a mouse model of contact hypersensitivity or herpes
simplex virus infection.

By sequencing a BAC clone containing the IL1B gene (147720) and
searching EST databases for IL1-like ligands, Busfield et al. (2000)
identified IL1H1, which they designated IL1RP2. SDS-PAGE analysis showed
that IL1H1 is expressed as a 20-kD protein. Northern blot analysis
detected a 1.8-kb IL1H1 transcript in the squamous cell epithelium of
the esophagus. In situ hybridization analysis revealed expression in the
middle layers of epithelium. In vitro, IL1H1 message was rapidly induced
following stimulation of keratinocytes.

GENE FUNCTION

Using RT-PCR and immunohistochemical analysis, Johnston et al. (2011)
demonstrated increased expression of IL1F5 (605507), IL1F6 (605509),
IL1F8 (605508), and IL1F9 in psoriasis (177900) plaque compared with
uninvolved skin from psoriasis patients. Analysis of 2 mouse psoriasis
models produced similar results. IL1A and TNF (191160) induced
expression of the IL1F transcripts in normal human keratinocytes.
Microarray analysis showed that IL1F cytokines, particularly IL1F8,
increased mRNA expression of human beta-defensins and secretion of HBD2
(DEFB4; 602215) and HBD3 (DEFB103A; 606611). Johnston et al. (2011)
concluded that IL1F cytokines have important roles in inflammatory skin
diseases and may be targets for antipsoriatic therapies.

GENE STRUCTURE

Busfield et al. (2000) determined that the IL1H1 gene contains 4 exons.

MAPPING

Kumar et al. (2000) stated that the IL1H1 gene maps to chromosome
2q12-q21, near other IL1 family members. By radiation hybrid analysis,
Busfield et al. (2000) mapped the IL1H1 gene to chromosome 2q12.1.

Nicklin et al. (2002) determined that the gene order within the IL1 gene
cluster on chromosome 2, from centromere to telomere, is IL1A-IL1B-IL1F7
(IL37; 605510)-IL1F9-IL1F6-IL1F8-IL1F5-IL1F10 (615296)-IL1RN (147679).
Of these, only IL1A, IL1B, and IL36B are transcribed toward the
centromere.

Gross (2011) mapped the IL1F9 gene to chromosome 2q13 based on an
alignment of the IL1F9 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC096721) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database analysis, followed by PCR of a human kidney cDNA library,
Wang et al. (2005) cloned SPSB2, which they called SSB2. The deduced
263-amino acid protein shares 50% amino acid identity with SPSB1
(611657). SPSB2 contains a central SPRY domain and a C-terminal SOCS

607082	TITLE *607082 CALCIUM CHANNEL, VOLTAGE-DEPENDENT, ALPHA-2/DELTA SUBUNIT 2; CACNA2D2
;;KIAA0558
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The CACNA2D2 gene encodes the alpha-2-delta-2 auxiliary subunit of high
voltage-gated calcium channels. Auxiliary subunits modulate calcium
current and channel activation and inactivation kinetics, and may be
involved in proper assembly and membrane localization of the channels.
Alpha-2-delta-2 is a receptor for the antiepileptic drug gabapentin
(summary by Edvardson et al., 2013).

CLONING

By searching for sequences with the potential to encode large proteins
expressed in brain, Nagase et al. (1998) identified a cDNA encoding
CACNA2D2, which they called KIAA0558. The deduced 1,145-amino acid
protein was predicted to be 45% identical to mouse Cacna2d2. RT-PCR
analysis detected ubiquitous expression.

Using a positional cloning strategy to identify a putative tumor
suppressor gene on chromosome 3p21.3, Gao et al. (2000) obtained a cDNA
encoding CACNA2D2. The CACNA2D2 protein is 56% identical to CACNA2D1
(114204), and 17 of 22 cysteines in CACNA2D2 are conserved in CACNA2S1,
suggesting similar secondary structures. CACNA2D2 also has multiple
putative N-glycosylation sites. Northern blot analysis revealed
expression of a 5.5-kb transcript that was most abundant in lung and
testis, followed by brain, heart, and pancreas, with low levels in
prostate and skeletal muscle. Some lung cancer lines expressed CACNA2D2.
Western blot analysis showed expression of a 150-kD protein, larger than
the predicted 130 kD, presumably due to glycosylation. Functional
analysis indicated that CACNA2D2 is able to act as an auxiliary subunit
of all 3 subfamilies of voltage-gated calcium channels.

By physical cloning methodologies and bioinformatic computational
analyses, Lerman and Minna (2000) identified a number of genes,
including CACNA2D2, in a region of chromosome 3p21.3 that is associated
with a putative lung cancer tumor suppressor gene. They did not detect
CACNA2D2 mutations in any lung cancer cell lines tested.

Each alpha-2-delta subunit is encoded by a single gene and
post-translationally cleaved into a long, N-terminal, extracellular
alpha-2 protein and a shorter, membrane-anchored delta polypeptide; the
alpha-2 and delta proteins are covalently linked by disulfide bonds
(summary by Brill et al., 2004).

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Lerman and Minna (2000) determined that
the CACNA2D2 gene contains at least 40 exons and spans approximately 140
kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the CACNA2D2
gene to chromosome 3. By genomic sequence analysis, Gao et al. (2000)
refined the localization to 3p21.3, a site of frequent deletions in
breast and lung cancers.

GENE FUNCTION

Hoppa et al. (2012) showed that a trafficking step probably sets
synaptic voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) levels in rats, because
overexpression of the pore-forming alpha-1A VGCC subunit (CACNA1A;
601011) fails to change synaptic VGCC abundance or function.
Alpha-2-deltas are a family of glycosylphosphatidylinositol
(GPI)-anchored VGCC-associated subunits that, in addition to being the
target of the potent neuropathic analgesics gabapentin and pregabalin
(alpha-2-delta-1 (CACNA2D1) and alpha-2-delta-2 (CACNA2D2)), were also
identified in a forward genetic screen for pain genes (alpha-2-delta-3
(CACNA2D3; 606399)). Hoppa et al. (2012) showed that these proteins
confer powerful modulation of presynaptic function through 2 distinct
molecular mechanisms. First, alpha-2-delta subunits set synaptic VGCC
abundance, as predicted from their chaperone-like function when
expressed in nonneuronal cells. Second, alpha-2-deltas configure
synaptic VGCCs to drive exocytosis through an extracellular metal
ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS), a conserved set of amino acids
within the predicted von Willebrand A domain of alpha-2-delta.
Expression of alpha-2-delta with an intact MIDAS motif leads to an 80%
increase in release probability, while simultaneously protecting
exocytosis from blockade by an intracellular calcium chelator.
Alpha-2-deltas harboring MIDAS site mutations still drive synaptic
accumulation of VGCCs; however, they no longer change release
probability or sensitivity to intracellular calcium chelators. Hoppa et
al. (2012) concluded that their data reveal dual functionality of these
clinically important VGCC subunits, allowing synapses to make more
efficient use of calcium entry to drive neurotransmitter release.

ANIMAL MODEL

Brodbeck et al. (2002) showed that mice with the 'ducky' (du) mutation,
a model for absence epilepsy (see 600131), had a mutation in Cacna2d2
gene. The mutation resulted in the introduction of a premature stop
codon and the expression of a truncated protein encoded by the first 3
exons of Cacna2d2, followed by 8 novel amino acids. The shortened mRNA
and protein were expressed in mutant mouse cerebellum and Purkinje
cells. Brodbeck et al. (2002) detected high expression of the normal
protein in cerebellar Purkinje cells, but found that ducky mice had
abnormalities in their Purkinje cell dendritic trees. Functional
analysis indicated that the mutant Cacna2d2 protein failed to increase
or even decreased the peak current density of the voltage-gated Ca(V)2.1
(CACNA1A; 601011)/beta-4 (CACNB4; 601949) channel combination,
suggesting that it may contribute to the ducky phenotype.

Brill et al. (2004) identified a recessive mouse phenotype, 'entla,'
caused by an in-frame duplication of 39 amino acids in the Cacna2d2
gene, resulting in expression of a full-length, membrane-associated
protein, but with loss of the disulfide linkage between the 2 derived
proteins. Mutant mice developed ataxia by postnatal day 13 to 15
followed by paroxysmal dyskinesia. The mice showed reduced size and
weight, increased mortality before weaning, and female infertility. EEG
studies suggested absence epilepsy, with 2- and 4-Hz spike-wave
discharges in the cortex and hippocampus. Cerebellar Purkinje cells
isolated from mutant mice showed about a 50% reduction in current, as
well as a reduction of gabapentin binding to the membrane compared to
wildtype and to heterozygous mice. Entla (ent) mice showed no
neuroanatomical abnormalities.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
VARIANT OF UNKNOWN SIGNIFICANCE
CACNA2D2, LEU1040PRO

This variant is classified as a variant of unknown significance because
its contribution to early infantile epileptic encephalopathy has not
been confirmed.

In 3 sibs, born of consanguineous Arab-Palestinian parents, with early
infantile epileptic encephalopathy, global developmental delay, and
cerebellar atrophy, Edvardson et al. (2013) identified a homozygous
3119A-G transition in the CACNA2D2 gene, resulting in a leu1040-to-pro
(L1040P) substitution at a highly conserved residue. The variant, which
was identified by linkage analysis combined with whole-exome sequencing,
was not found in 102 controls or in 6,503 control exomes. In vitro
expression studies in Xenopus oocytes showed that the variant protein
decreased currents of N- and L-type calcium channels and caused slower
inactivation in N-type channels. Although the variant protein was
expressed, it showed decreased localization to the plasma membrane
compared to wildtype, suggesting that it may not properly associate with
the alpha-1 subunit. Edvardson et al. (2013) postulated that prolonged
channel opening and calcium influx during depolarization associated with
delayed inactivation may underlie the epileptic phenotype observed in
these patients. There was no evidence for a dominant-negative effect.
Exome sequencing in 1 of the 3 affected sibs also identified a
homozygous C-to-T transition in the CELSR3 gene (604264), resulting in a
met2630-to-ile (M2630I; 604264.0001) substitution at a highly conserved
residue. This variant also segregated with the disease state in the
family. Inactivation of Celsr3 in mice causes abnormalities in
connectivity in the cerebral cortex (Zhou et al., 2008). Edvardson et
al. (2013) could not exclude a role for the CELSR3 mutation in the
epileptic phenotype in this family.

142230	TITLE *142230 HEMATOPOIETIC PROGENITOR CELL ANTIGEN CD34; CD34
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CD34 is a monomeric cell surface antigen with a molecular mass of
approximately 110 kD that is selectively expressed on human
hematopoietic progenitor cells.

CLONING

In the hands of Sutherland et al. (1988), partial amino acid analysis of
highly purified CD34 antigen revealed no significant sequence similarity
with any previously described structures. Sequential immunoprecipitation
and Western blot analysis indicated that this antigen is not a member of
the leukosialin/sialophorin family, despite the fact that these
molecules share several structural similarities.

Simmons et al. (1992) isolated a cDNA clone for CD34. They stated that
the gene is expressed by small vessel endothelial cells in addition to
hematopoietic progenitor cells and is a sialomucin of as-yet-unknown
function.

Study of the CD34 cDNA permitted He et al. (1992) to demonstrate that it
encodes a type I transmembrane protein with no obvious homology to other
known proteins.

OTHER FEATURES

Sutherland et al. (1993) provided a review, including potential clinical
applications in selecting for hematopoietic stem cell progenitors from
tumor-contaminated marrow in preparation for transplantation and for
genetic manipulation in gene therapy.

GENE STRUCTURE

Satterthwaite et al. (1992) reported that the CD34 gene spans 26 kb and
has 8 exons. Using RNase protection, they demonstrated that the start
site of CD34 transcription is 258 bp upstream of the translational start
site. He et al. (1992) showed that the upstream regulatory sequences of
CD34 contain no TATA or CAAT box sequences, but MYB, MYC, and ETS-like
binding motifs were identified.

GENE FUNCTION

Continuous turnover of epithelia is ensured by the extensive
self-renewal capacity of tissue-specific stem cells. Similarly,
epithelial tumor maintenance relies on cancer stem cells, which co-opt
stem cell properties. In murine skin, follicular morphogenesis is driven
by bulge stem cells that specifically express CD34. Malanchi et al.
(2008) identified a population of cells in early epidermal tumors
characterized by phenotype and functional similarities to normal bulge
skin stem cells. This population contains cancer stem cells, which are
the only cells with tumor initiation properties. Transplants derived
from these cancer stem cells preserve the hierarchical organization of
the primary tumor. Malanchi et al. (2008) described beta-catenin
(116806) signaling as being essential in sustaining the cancer stem cell
phenotype. Ablation of the beta-catenin gene results in the loss of
cancer stem cells and complete tumor regression. In addition, Malanchi
et al. (2008) provided evidence for the involvement of increased
beta-catenin signaling in malignant human squamous cell carcinomas.
Malanchi et al. (2008) concluded that because Wnt/beta-catenin signaling
is not essential for normal epidermal homeostasis, such a mechanistic
difference may thus be targeted to eliminate cancer stem cells and
consequently eradicate squamous cell carcinomas.

MAPPING

By Southern blot analysis of DNA from a panel of human/mouse somatic
cell hybrids using a CD34 cDNA probe, Tenen et al. (1990) demonstrated
that the gene for CD34 is located on 1q12-qter. By means of in situ
hybridization, Howell et al. (1991) narrowed the assignment to 1q32. By
fluorescence in situ hybridization, Satterthwaite et al. (1992) mapped
the gene to 1q32.

ANIMAL MODEL

To analyze the involvement of CD34 in hematopoiesis, Cheng et al. (1996)
produced both embryonic stem (ES) cells in mice null for the expression
of this mucin. Analysis of yolk sac-like hematopoietic development in
embryoid bodies derived from CD34-null ES cells showed a significant
delay in both erythroid and myeloid differentiation that could be
reversed by transfection of the mutant ES cells with CD34 constructs
expressing either a complete or truncated cytoplasmic domain. In spite
of these diminished embryonic hematopoietic progenitor numbers, the
CD34-null mice developed normally, and the hematopoietic profile of
adult blood appeared typical. However, the colony-forming activity of
hematopoietic progenitors derived from both bone marrow and spleen was
significantly reduced in adult CD34-deficient animals.

Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) give rise to all blood cells. CD34 is a
sialomucin-like adhesion molecule that is expressed on a few percent of
primitive bone marrow cells. In human bone marrow, virtually all
colony-forming unit activity resides in the population expressing human
CD34. In primates, CD34-positive cells, but not CD34-negative cells,
repopulate lethally irradiated baboons. On the other hand, in murine
hematopoiesis, HSCs are found almost exclusively in the CD34-negative to
-low fraction. Okuno et al. (2002) made transgenic mouse strains with
human genomic P1 artificial chromosome clones spanning the entire CD34
genomic locus. In all transgenic mouse strains, a vast majority of
phenotypic and functional HSC populations including mouse CD34-negative
or -low cells expressed the human CD34 transgene. These data strongly
supported the notion that CD34-positive human bone marrow cells contain
long-term HSCs that can maintain hematopoiesis throughout life.

Using fluorescence intravital microscopy (IVM) with homing assays,
Hidalgo et al. (2002) examined the repopulation of bone marrow of
sublethally irradiated nonobese diabetic (NOD)/severe combined
immunodeficiency (SCID) mice, which have multiple defects in innate and
adaptive immunologic functions, with human CD34-positive hematopoietic
progenitor cells obtained either from cord blood or from adult bone
marrow or peripheral blood. Human hematopoietic progenitor cells rolled
and arrested in NOD/SCID bone marrow microvessels, and the rolling
capacity of neonatal cord blood cells was much lower than that of adult
cells. Rolling and retention were nearly abolished in NOD/SCID Selp
(173610) -/- Sele (131210) -/- mice and in NOD/SCID Sele -/- mice. Flow
cytometric and IVM analyses suggested that the neonatal defect resulted
from expression of a nonfunctional form of SELPLG (600738) on cord blood
CD34-positive cells that were unable to bind Selp. This subset of cells
was enriched in CD34-positive/CD38 (107270)-low/negative progenitors.
Hidalgo et al. (2002) proposed that manipulation of expression of
selectins and their ligands may improve homing of cord blood
CD34-positive cells to bone marrow.

603701	TITLE *603701 RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN S26; RPS26
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The eukaryotic ribosome is composed of 4 RNA species (see 180450) and
approximately 80 different proteins. The ribosomal protein genes appear
to be members of multigene families, most of which contain multiple
processed pseudogenes and 1 intron-containing functional gene.

CLONING

Vincent et al. (1993) isolated a HeLa cell cDNA encoding ribosomal
protein S26 (RPS26). Northern blot analysis demonstrated that the 600-
to 700-bp RPS26 transcript is expressed at high and comparable levels in
various human adult tissues. The deduced RPS26 protein has 115 amino
acids (SWISS-PROT SWISSPROT Q06722).

GENE STRUCTURE

Filipenko et al. (1998) isolated the genomic sequence of the functional
RPS26 gene using PCR. The RPS26 gene has 4 exons which span 2,027 bp and
result in an mRNA of 438 bp, plus the poly(A) tail. Like other
vertebrate ribosomal protein genes, the RPS26 gene has a transcription
start site that is located within a polypyrimidine tract, and a short
5-prime untranslated region.

MAPPING

By analysis of somatic cell hybrids, Filipenko et al. (1998) mapped the
intron-containing RPS26 gene to chromosome 12. Kenmochi et al. (1998)
mapped the RPS26 gene to 12q using somatic cell hybrid and radiation
hybrid mapping analyses.

GENE FUNCTION

Using siRNA knockdown in HeLa cells to analyze the role of RPS26 in
pre-rRNA processing, Doherty et al. (2010) found that depletion of RPS26
led to decreased levels of 18S rRNA, indicating that RPS26 is necessary
for production of the small subunit. RNA blot analysis showed
accumulation of 43S, 26S, and 18S-E pre-rRNAs, consistent with defects
in cleavage at both ends of the 18S rRNA.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Doherty et al. (2010) sequenced 35 ribosomal protein genes in a cohort
of 117 patients with Diamond-Blackfan anemia (see DBA10, 613309) and
identified 9 different mutations in the RPS26 gene in 12 patients (see,
e.g., 603701.0001-603701.0005). None of the mutations were found in at
least 520 chromosomes from a control population of similar, largely
European origin. Six probands had a mutation in the first codon,
changing met to leu, val, or arg, suggesting that the translation
initiation codon may be a hotspot in RPS26. Doherty et al. (2010) noted
that 1 of the mutation-positive patients (603701.0002) had cleft lip and
palate, making RPS26 the third DBA gene in which mutation is associated
with clefting in DBA.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
DIAMOND-BLACKFAN ANEMIA 10
RPS26, MET1VAL

In 6 patients with Diamond-Blackfan anemia-10 (613309) from 4 families,
Doherty et al. (2010) identified heterozygosity for a 1A-G transition in
exon 1 of the RPS26 gene, causing a met1-to-val (M1V) substitution that
eliminates the start codon and is predicted to result in an untranslated
protein. The mutation was not found in the unaffected parents of 2 of
the probands or in at least 520 control chromosomes. Of the 6 patients
with the M1V mutation, 3 were responsive to initial steroid therapy and
3 were unresponsive; in 1 father-daughter pair, the father was
responsive and the daughter was unresponsive. Three of the patients were
receiving red blood cell transfusions, 2 were on steroid therapy, and 1
required no therapy. One of the male patients, who was diagnosed at 7
weeks of age, also had duplicated pelvis and calyx of the right kidney.

.0002
DIAMOND-BLACKFAN ANEMIA 10
RPS26, MET1LEU

In a male patient with Diamond-Blackfan anemia-10 (613309), Doherty et
al. (2010) identified heterozygosity for a 1A-T transition in exon 1 of
the RPS26 gene, causing a met1-to-leu (M1L) substitution that eliminates
the start codon and is predicted to result in an untranslated protein.
The mutation was not found in his unaffected parents and sister or in at
least 520 control chromosomes. The patient, who was responsive to
steroid therapy, also had cleft lip and palate.

.0003
DIAMOND-BLACKFAN ANEMIA 10
RPS26, ASP33ASN

In a male patient who was diagnosed at 8 months of age with
Diamond-Blackfan anemia (613309), Doherty et al. (2010) identified
heterozygosity for a 97G-A transition in exon 2 of the RPS26 gene,
resulting in an asp33-to-asn (D33N) substitution. The mutation was not
found in his unaffected parents or sister, or in at least 520 control
chromosomes. Other features in this patient included inguinal hernia,
unilaterally absent vas deferens, abnormal epididymis, and pronounced
bony prominence of a cervical spinous process.

.0004
DIAMOND-BLACKFAN ANEMIA 10
RPS26, 1-BP INS, 31G

In a female patient with Diamond-Blackfan anemia-10 (613309), Doherty et
al. (2010) identified heterozygosity for a 1-bp insertion (31insG) in
exon 2 of the RPS26 gene, causing a frameshift and resulting in a
termination sequence at codon 25. The mutation was not found in at least
520 control chromosomes. The patient, who had no associated
malformations, had been unresponsive to initial steroid therapy and was
deceased.

.0005
DIAMOND-BLACKFAN ANEMIA 10
RPS26, IVS1, G-A, +1

In a male patient with Diamond-Blackfan anemia-10 (613309), Doherty et
al. (2010) identified heterozygosity for a splice site mutation (+1G-A)
in intron 1 of the RPS26 gene. The de novo mutation was not found in
either of his parents or an unaffected sister and brother, or in at
least 520 control chromosomes. The patient, who had been unresponsive to
initial steroid therapy, was deceased.
