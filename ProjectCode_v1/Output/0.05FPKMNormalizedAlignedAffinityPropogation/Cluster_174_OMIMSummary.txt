;;PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE 2A, CATALYTIC SUBUNIT, ALPHA ISOFORM; PP2CA
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Protein phosphorylation, a crucial posttranslational modification step
controlling many diverse cellular functions, is dependent on the
opposing actions of protein kinases and protein phosphatases. The enzyme
protein phosphatase 2A is 1 of 4 major protein phosphatases identified
in the cytosol of eukaryotic cells which are responsible for the
dephosphorylation of serine and threonine residues in proteins. Although
all 4 protein phosphatases, PP1, PP2A, PP2B, and PP2C, have overlapping
substrate specificities in vitro, they can be distinguished by the use
of inhibitor proteins and by their dependence on metal ions. PP1 is
inhibited by nanomolar concentrations of 2 thermostable proteins,
inhibitor 1 and inhibitor 2, whereas the type 2 phosphatases are
unaffected by these inhibitors. The type 2 phosphatases can be
distinguished by how their activity is regulated: PP2A activity is
independent of metal ions, PP2B is activated by Ca(2+)/calmodulin, and
PP2C is activated by Mg(2+) (Cohen and Cohen, 1989). Protein phosphatase
2A appears to play a role in the regulation of most major metabolic
pathways, as well as translation, transcription, and control of
transition from G2 to the M phase of the cell cycle. PP2A may function
as either a tumor promoter or tumor suppressor, depending on the cell
type or the transforming agent. The mammalian enzyme can be isolated as
a catalytic subunit of 36 kD complexed to 1 regulatory subunit of 65 kD
and to another regulatory subunit of varying molecular mass, depending
on the tissue and the separation technique used. Two isoforms of the
catalytic subunit of PP2A, alpha and beta (176916), are demonstrable in
many mammalian species. The structures of these catalytic subunits show
the highest evolutionary conservation of all known enzymes, supporting
the idea that they may serve crucial functions.

CLONING

Stone et al. (1988) isolated the human cDNA for the PPP2CA subunit from
lung and lung fibroblast libraries. The cDNA encodes a 309-amino acid
polypeptide.

MAPPING

Jones et al. (1993) mapped the PPP2CA gene to human chromosome 5 by
somatic cell hybridization and refined the mapping to 5q23-q31 by in
situ hybridization.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Herzog et al. (2012) gained distance restraints on a modular interaction
network of protein complexes affinity-purified from human cells by
applying an adapted crosslinking and mass spectrometry (XL-MS) protocol.
Systematic analysis of human protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) complexes
identified 176 interprotein and 570 intraprotein crosslinks that link
specific trimeric PP2A complexes to a multitude of adaptor proteins that
control their cellular functions. Spatial restraints guided molecular
modeling of the binding interface between immunoglobulin binding
protein-1 (IGBP1; 300139) and PP2A and revealed the topology of TCP1
(186980) ring complex (TRiC) chaperonin (see 605139) interacting with
the PP2A regulatory subunit 2ABG. Herzog et al. (2012) concluded that
this study established XL-MS as an integral part of hybrid structural
biology approaches for the analysis of endogenous protein complexes.

GENE FUNCTION

Veech (2003) pointed out that most modern biologists and contemporary
textbooks of biochemistry present the glycolytic pathway and the
synthesis of fats as history, all the relevant facts being known. He
pointed to the report by Kabashima et al. (2003), combining new insights
into the regulation of lipogenesis with 'heroic protein chemistry and an
elegant combination of enzymology and molecular biology.' He described
how a small and ignored metabolite of the hexose monophosphate pathway,
xylulose 5-phosphate, activates protein phosphatase-2A to mediate the
acute effects of carbohydrate feeding on the glycolytic pathway, as well
as the coordinate long-term control of the enzymes required for fatty
acid and triglyceride synthesis.

Gergs et al. (2004) generated transgenic mice that overexpress the
catalytic subunit alpha of PP2A in the heart. The phosphorylation states
of phospholamban (PLN; 172405), troponin I (TNNI3; 191044), and
eukaryotic elongation factor-2 (EEF2; 130610) were reduced
significantly, but the expression of junctional and free sarcoplasmic
reticulum proteins was not altered. The transgenic mice showed islands
of necrosis and fibrosis in the myocardium and developed cardiac
hypertrophy, dilatation, and reduced contractility, although no increase
in morbidity or mortality was seen. Gergs et al. (2004) concluded that
PP2A has a fundamental role in cardiac function, and suggested that
disturbances in protein phosphatase expression and activity may cause or
exacerbate the course of cardiac diseases.

Chowdhury et al. (2005) found that PP2A is involved in removing
phosphorylated H2AX (601772), or gamma-H2AX, from DNA foci during
double-stranded break repair. PPP2CA and gamma-H2AX coimmunoprecipitated
from human cell lines and colocalized in DNA damage foci, and PP2A
dephosphorylated gamma-H2AX in vitro. Recruitment of PPP2CA to DNA
damage foci was H2AX dependent. Inhibition of PPP2CA by RNA interference
led to the persistence of gamma-H2AX foci, inefficient DNA repair, and
cells that were hypersensitive to DNA damage.

Riedel et al. (2006) showed in both fission and budding yeast that Sgo1
(SGOL1; 609168) recruited to centromeres a specific form of PP2A. Its
inactivation caused loss of centromeric cohesin (see RAD21; 606462) at
anaphase I and random segregation of sister centromeres at the second
meiotic division. Artificial recruitment of PP2A to chromosome arms
prevented Rec8 (608193) phosphorylation and hindered resolution of
chiasmata. Riedel et al. (2006) concluded that their data were
consistent with the notion that efficient cleavage of Rec8 requires
phosphorylation of cohesin and that this is blocked by PP2A at meiosis I
centromeres.

In mitotic cells, phosphorylation of cohesin promotes its dissociation
from chromosomes, but centromeric cohesin is protected from
phosphorylation until kinetochores are properly captured by the spindle
microtubules. Kitajima et al. (2006) found that a shugoshin complex made
up of SGO1, SGO2 (SGOL2; 612425), and a specific subtype of PP2A
containing the regulatory B56 subunit (see 601643) was required for
protection of centromeric cohesin in HeLa cells. The shugoshin-PP2A
complex protected cohesin by reversing phosphorylation of the cohesin
subunit SA2 (STAG2; 300826). Both SGO1 and SGO2 bound PP2A directly,
although SGO1 appeared to bind the regulatory subunit PP2A-B56, while
SGO2 appeared to bind the core subunit PP2A-A (see 605983). Knockdown
studies showed that SGO2 tethered PP2A to the centromere, whereas SGO1
had the more important role in centromere protection and appeared to
facilitate PP2A function at centromeres.

By yeast 2-hybrid screening, in vitro binding analysis, and
coimmunoprecipitation analysis, Gil-Bernabe et al. (2006) found that
securin (PTTG1; 604147) interacted with the B55-delta regulatory subunit
(PPP2R2D; 613992) and the alpha catalytic subunit of PP2A. Securin was a
PP2A substrate in vivo and in vitro. Treatment of cells with a chemical
PP2A inhibitor resulted in hyperphosphorylated forms of securin that
were unstable due to degradation through the ubiquitin pathway.
Gil-Bernabe et al. (2006) proposed that PP2A stabilizes and regulates
securin levels by counteracting its phosphorylation.

Stipanovich et al. (2008) demonstrated that drugs of abuse, as well as
food reinforcement learning, promote the nuclear accumulation of 32-kD
dopamine- and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein (DARPP32; 604399). This
accumulation is mediated through a signaling cascade involving dopamine
D1 receptors (see 126449), cAMP-dependent activation of protein
phosphatase-2A, and dephosphorylation of DARPP32 at ser97 and inhibition
of its nuclear export. The nuclear accumulation of DARPP32, a potent
inhibitor of protein phosphatase-1 (see 176875), increased the
phosphorylation of histone H3 (see 602810), an important component of
nucleosomal response. Mutation of ser97 profoundly altered behavioral
effects of drugs of abuse and decreased motivation for food, underlining
the functional importance of this signaling cascade.

Initiation and maintenance of mitosis require the inhibition of PP2A,
which dephosphorylates mitotic substrates. The protein kinase Greatwall
(MASTL; 608221) is required to maintain mitosis through PP2A inhibition.
Gharbi-Ayachi et al. (2010) described how Greatwall (Gwl) activation
results in PP2A inhibition. They identified Arpp19 (605487) and Ensa
(603061) as 2 substrates of Gwl that, when phosphorylated by this
kinase, associate with and inhibit PP2, thus promoting mitotic entry.
Conversely, in the absence of Gwl activity, Arpp19 and Ensa are
dephosphorylated and lose their capacity to bind and inhibit PP2A.
Gharbi-Ayachi et al. (2010) stated that although both proteins can
inhibit PP2A, endogenous Arpp19, but not Ensa, is responsible for PP2A
inhibition and mitotic entry in Xenopus egg extracts.

Using isoelectric focusing in combination with suitable inhibitors in
lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) from patients with monoclonal
gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), multiple myeloma (see
254500), or Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (see 153600), whose
paraprotein targeted paratarg-7 (STOML2; 608292) and who were carriers
of hyperphosphorylated paratarg-7 (615121), Preuss et al. (2011)
demonstrated that PRKCZ (176982) is the active kinase responsible for
phosphorylation at ser17 of paratarg-7. Analysis of LCLs from patients
and controls showed that phosphorylation of paratarg-7 occurred in both,
but dephosphorylation was inhibited in patients carrying
hyperphosphorylated paratarg-7. Protease inhibitor experiments with LCLs
revealed that PPP2CA is responsible for the dephosphorylation of the
hyperphosphorylated form of paratarg-7. Although the total amount of
PPP2CA did not differ between patients and controls, the ratio of
phosphorylated to nonphosphorylated PPP2CA differed strikingly: in
patients, the phosphorylated form of catalytic subunit C of PPP2CA (with
phosphorylation at tyr307, which inactivates the enzyme) was abundant,
whereas in healthy donors the nonphosphorylated, active form prevailed.
Preuss et al. (2011) concluded that the genetic defect underlying
autosomal dominantly inherited hyperphosphorylation of paratarg-7 is not
in PPP2CA itself, but in genes or proteins controlling PPP2CA activity
by phosphorylation of its catalytic subunit.

612543	TITLE *612543 UBIQUITIN-SPECIFIC PROTEASE 36; USP36
;;KIAA1453
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Modification of cellular proteins by ubiquitin is an essential
regulatory mechanism controlled by the coordinated action of multiple
ubiquitin-conjugating and deubiquitinating enzymes. USP36 belongs to a
large family of cysteine proteases that function as deubiquitinating
enzymes (Quesada et al., 2004).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned USP36, which they designated
KIAA1453. The deduced protein contains 1,123 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA
detected highest expression in testis and ovary, with weaker expression
in all other adult and fetal tissues and specific brain regions
examined.

By searching databases for sequences similar to USP family members,
followed by PCR of lung, kidney, endothelium, and brain cDNA libraries,
Quesada et al. (2004) cloned USP36. The deduced protein contains
cysteine, histidine, and asparagine residues required for catalytic
activity, and it has a QQD box characteristic of USPs. Northern blot
analysis detected a major USP36 transcript highly expressed in skeletal
muscle and testis. Variable expression was detected in other tissues
examined.

GENE FUNCTION

Quesada et al. (2004) found that recombinant USP36 showed
deubiquitination activity against ubiquitin-beta-galactosidase in an in
vitro assay.

Buszczak et al. (2009) described a Drosophila gene called 'scrawny'
(scny), which is similar to human USP36 and encodes a ubiquitin-specific
protease that is required in germline, epithelial, and intestinal stem
cells. Like its yeast relative UBP10, scrawny deubiquitylates histone
H2B and functions in gene silencing. Consistent with previous studies of
this conserved pathway of chromatin regulation, scny mutant cells have
elevated levels of ubiquitinylated H2B and trimethylated H3K4. Buszczak
et al. (2009) concluded that inhibiting H2B ubiquitylation through
scrawny represents a common mechanism within stem cells that is used to
repress the premature expression of key differentiation genes, including
Notch target genes.

MAPPING

By analysis of a human-rodent hybrid panel, Nagase et al. (2000) mapped
the USP36 gene to chromosome 17.

604078	TITLE *604078 ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 136; ZNF136
DESCRIPTION Transcriptional regulatory proteins containing tandemly repeated zinc
finger domains are thought to be involved in both normal and abnormal
cellular proliferation and differentiation. One abundant class of such
transcriptional regulators resembles the Drosophila Kruppel segmentation
gene product due to the presence of repeated Cys2-His2 (C2H2) zinc
finger domains that are connected by conserved sequences, called H/C
links. See ZNF91 (603971) for general information on zinc finger
proteins.

By screening a human insulinoma cDNA library with a degenerate
oligonucleotide corresponding to the H/C linker sequence, Tommerup et
al. (1993) isolated cDNAs potentially encoding zinc finger proteins.
Tommerup and Vissing (1995) performed sequence analysis on a number of
these cDNAs and identified several novel zinc finger protein genes,
including ZNF136. The ZNF136 cDNA predicts a 540-amino acid (GenBank
GENBANK U09367) Kruppel-type zinc finger protein containing an
N-terminal KRAB domain. Vissing et al. (1995) reported that the deduced
ZNF136 protein contains 14 zinc finger domains followed by a putative
degenerate finger domain, and only the KRAB A box. They demonstrated
that the ZNF136 KRAB A box functions as a weak transcriptional repressor
domain when fused to the yeast GAL4 DNA-binding domain. Northern blot
analysis detected ZNF136 expression in all tissues examined.

By FISH, Tommerup and Vissing (1995) mapped the ZNF136 gene to
19p13.2-p13.12.

154365	TITLE *154365 PROTEASOME 26S SUBUNIT, ATPase, 2; PSMC2
;;MAMMALIAN SUPPRESSOR OF sgv-1 OF YEAST; MSS1;;
PROTEASE 26S, SUBUNIT 7; S7
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The 26S proteasome (see PSMC1; 602706) is a multisubunit protease
complex composed of a 20S core component and two 19S regulatory
complexes. PSMC2 is 1 of 6 putative ATPases contained within the
regulatory complex. PSMC2 was first identified as a possible cellular
factor that cooperates with the human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1)
protein Tat, a potent activator of virus gene expression.

CLONING

By transcomplementation of a yeast sgv1-deficient mutant, Shibuya et al.
(1992) isolated a human cDNA from a novel gene, MSS1. The MSS1 protein
was found to share 42% sequence identity with the human TBP1 protein
(PSMC3; 186852), which binds Tat in vitro and suppresses Tat-mediated
transactivation in vivo (Nelbock et al., 1990). Shibuya et al. (1992)
found that the levels of HIV activation by Tat correlated with
endogenous levels of MSS1 mRNA. Furthermore, they provided evidence that
expression of MSS1 enhances the Tat-mediated transactivation. The 1.5-kb
MSS1 cDNA encodes a protein of 433 amino acids.

To characterize components of the 26S proteasome, Dubiel et al. (1993)
performed peptide sequence analysis on subunit 7 (S7). They determined
that S7 is identical to MSS1. By SDS-PAGE, S7 has a molecular mass of 49
kD.

By Western blot analysis of rat tissues, Yanagi et al. (2000) found that
the level of PSMC2 expression varied among tissues but was ubiquitous.
This was in contrast to the expression pattern of the 30-kD component of
the proteasome 20S core, which showed similar levels of expression in
all tissues. Immunolocalization of proteasome subunits in HeLa and HepG2
cells showed proteasome localization within nuclei, while
immunolocalization of PSMC2 gave homogeneous staining of both cytoplasm
and nucleoplasm. By glycerol gradient sedimentation, Yanagi et al.
(2000) found PSMC2 purified from rat liver nuclear extracts associated
with the proteasome and with protein complexes of lighter density, and
it also existed as a monomer. They also found that several basal
transcription factors for RNA polymerase II, including TATA box-binding
protein (TBP; 600075), and the general transcription factors IIB (GFT2B;
189963), IIH (see GTF2H1; 189972), and IIF (see GTF2F1; 189968)
coimmunoprecipitated with PSMC2 from rat liver lysosomes, suggesting
dual functionality of PSMC2.

MAPPING

Tanahashi et al. (1998) mapped the PSMC2 gene to 7q22.1-q22.3 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization.

600126	TITLE *600126 PHOSPHODIESTERASE 4A, cAMP-SPECIFIC; PDE4A
;;DUNCE-LIKE PHOSPHODIESTERASE E2, FORMERLY; DPDE2, FORMERLY
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Cyclic nucleotides are important second messengers that regulate and
mediate a number of cellular responses to extracellular signals, such as
hormones, light, and neurotransmitters. Cyclic nucleotide
phosphodiesterases (PDEs) regulate the cellular concentrations of cyclic
nucleotides and thereby play a role in signal transduction. PDE4A is a
class IV cAMP-specific PDE (summary by Milatovich et al., 1994).

CLONING

Livi et al. (1990) isolated a cDNA for a cAMP phosphodiesterase from
human monocytes. The deduced protein contains 686 amino acids. Northern
blot analysis detected a predominant transcript of about 4.8 kb in
primary human monocytes and placenta. Obernolte et al. (1993) identified
the monocyte clone as the homolog of rat Pde4a.

Using degenerate primers based on Drosophila dnc and rat Dpd to amplify
human Dpd orthologs, followed by low-stringency hybridization of a brain
cDNA library, Bolger et al. (1993) cloned full-length DPDE2, which they
called PDE46, and a possible splice variant. The major transcript
encodes a deduced 779-amino acid protein with 2 N-terminal domains that
share a high degree of conservation with other DPDE proteins, and a
C-terminal catalytic domain. Northern blot analysis detected a 4.5-kb
DPDE2 transcript in normal human temporal cortex. RNase protection
assays showed that DPDE2 was expressed in 6 of 7 cell lines examined.

The difference in sequence within the 5-prime region of the open reading
frame reported by Bolger et al. (1993) and Livi et al. (1990) was
examined by Sullivan et al. (1994), who confirmed the sequence reported
by Bolger et al. (1993).

Sullivan et al. (1998) characterized the first 'short' PDE4A isoenzyme.
Huston et al. (1996) had characterized the full-length human 'long'
PDE4A isoenzyme.

GENE FUNCTION

Bolger et al. (1993) confirmed that DPDE2 showed cAMP PDE activity,
which was inhibited by several cyclin nucleotide PDE inhibitors.

Wilson et al. (1994) characterized the PDE4A enzyme.

Growth hormone (GH; 139250) is an essential priming factor for the
differentiation of 3T3-F442A mouse preadipocytes into mature adipocytes.
MacKenzie et al. (1998) found that GH-mediated differentiation of
3T3-F442A cells was accompanied by increased cAMP phosphodiesterase
activity by a specific Pde4a isoform that they called Pde4a5. They
showed that activation of Pde4a5 countered GH-mediated differentiation
of 3T3-F442A cells. Activation of Pde4a5 was mediated by a
phosphorylation pathway involving Jak2 (147796), PI3 kinase (see
601232), and p70S6 (see 608938).

Vecsey et al. (2009) demonstrated that sleep deprivation selectively
impaired 3-prime, 5-prime-cAMP- and protein kinase A (PKA; see
176911)-dependent forms of synaptic plasticity in the mouse hippocampus,
reduced cAMP signaling, and increased activity and protein levels of
PDE4, an enzyme that degrades cAMP. Treatment of mice with
phosphodiesterase inhibitors rescued the sleep deprivation-induced
deficits in cAMP signaling, synaptic plasticity, and
hippocampus-dependent memory. Vecsey et al. (2009) concluded that their
findings demonstrated that brief sleep deprivation disrupts hippocampal
function by interfering with cAMP signaling through increased PDE4
activity.

GENE STRUCTURE

Sullivan et al. (1998) determined that the PDE4A gene spans 50 kb and
contains at least 17 exons.

MAPPING

Milatovich et al. (1994) assigned the PDE4A gene to human chromosome 19
by Southern analysis of somatic cell hybrid lines and to mouse
chromosome 9 by Southern analysis of recombinant inbred (RI) mouse
strains. Horton et al. (1995) confirmed the localization of PDE4A to
chromosome 19 by analysis of a human/hamster somatic cell hybrid panel.
Using fluorescence in situ hybridization, they regionalized the gene to
chromosome 19p13.2-q12.

Sullivan et al. (1998) determined that the PDE4A gene is 350 kb proximal
to TYK2 (176941) and 850 kb distal to LDLR (606945) on chromosome
19p13.2.

603884	TITLE *603884 BCL2-ASSOCIATED ATHANOGENE 4; BAG4
;;SILENCER OF DEATH DOMAINS; SODD
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 (TNFR1; 191190) and several other
members of the TNF receptor superfamily, such as DR3 (603366), contain
intracellular death domains and are capable of triggering apoptosis when
activated by their respective ligands. However, TNFR1 self-associates
and signals independently of ligand when overexpressed. Jiang et al.
(1999) suggested the existence of a cellular mechanism to protect
against ligand-independent signaling by TNFR1 and other death domain
receptors. Using a yeast 2-hybrid assay with DR3 as bait, these authors
identified a cDNA encoding a protein that they designated 'silencer of
death domains' (SODD). The predicted 457-amino acid SODD protein
migrates as a doublet of 60 kD on Western blots of mammalian cell
extracts. Coimmunoprecipitation studies revealed that SODD is associated
with TNFR1 in vivo. TNF treatment of cells released SODD from TNFR1,
permitting the recruitment of proteins such as TRADD (603500) and TRAF2
(601895) to the active TNFR1 signaling complex. Jiang et al. (1999)
proposed that SODD is a negative regulatory protein that is normally
associated with the death domain of TNFR1, inhibiting the intrinsic
self-aggregation properties of the death domain and maintaining TNFR1 in
an inactive, monomeric state. This inhibition is relieved by
TNF-mediated receptor crosslinking, which triggers the rapid release of
SODD, allowing the death domains of TNFR1 to self-associate and bind
other proteins to form an active TNFR1 signaling complex. These authors
found that SODD also interacted with DR3 in yeast 2-hybrid assays,
suggesting that SODD association may be representative of a general
mechanism for preventing spontaneous signaling by death
domain-containing receptors.

BAG1 (601497) binds the ATPase domains of Hsp70 (see 140550) and Hsc70
(600816), modulating their chaperone activity. See BAG2 (603882).
Takayama et al. (1999) identified cDNAs corresponding to BAG4 and 3
other BAG1-like proteins. These authors suggested that interactions with
various BAG family proteins allow opportunities for specification and
diversification of Hsp70/Hsc70 chaperone functions.

GENE FUNCTION

Pancreatic cancer cells are resistant to TNFA-mediated apoptosis. By
Northern blot analysis, Ozawa et al. (2000) detected a 5-fold increased
expression of 3.5-kb SODD transcripts in pancreatic cancer cells and
pancreatic cancer cell lines compared with normal pancreatic cells.
Other gastrointestinal cancers (liver, esophagus, stomach, and colon)
showed no increased SODD expression. In situ hybridization analysis
revealed expression of SODD in the cytoplasm of cancer cells.

By array CGH, Yang et al. (2006) analyzed the copy number and expression
level of genes in the 8p12-p11 amplicon in 22 human breast cancer
(114480) specimens and 7 breast cancer cell lines. Of the 21 potential
genes identified, PCR analysis and functional analysis indicated that 3
genes, LSM1 (607281), BAG4, and C8ORF4 (607702), are breast cancer
oncogenes that can work in combination to influence a transformed
phenotype in human mammary epithelial cells.

MAPPING

The BAG4 gene resides on chromosome 8p11 (Yang et al., 2006).

;;UDP-GALACTOSE TRANSPORTER-RELATED 1; UGTREL1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching databases for sequences similar to UGT1 (SLC35A2; 314375),
followed by 5-prime RACE of human adult and fetal liver cDNA libraries,
Ishida et al. (1996) identified SLC35B1, which they called UGTREL1. They
also cloned the mouse and rat homologs.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the SLC35B1
gene to chromosome 17 (TMAP A007B33).

612508	TITLE *612508 ATP-BINDING CASSETTE, SUBFAMILY A, MEMBER 10; ABCA10
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ABC transporters, such as ABCA10, constitute a complex group of
structurally related multispan transmembrane proteins that translocate a
broad spectrum of substrates across cellular membranes (Wenzel et al.,
2003).

CLONING

By PCR of human macrophage cDNA using degenerate primers homologous to
human ABCA6 (612504), ABCA8 (612505), and ABCA9 (612507), Wenzel et al.
(2003) cloned ABCA10. The deduced 1,543-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of about 176 kD. It contains 2
nucleotide-binding folds, each with characteristic Walker A and B
motifs, and 2 transmembrane domains, each consisting of 6
membrane-spanning segments. ABCA10 has 3 potential N-glycosylation sites
in its extracellular loops. ABCA10 shares 62 to 63% amino acid identity
with ABCA6, ABCA8, and ABCA9, and like those proteins, it has an ABC
transporter signature sequence only in its N-terminal nucleotide-binding
fold. However, unlike ABCA6, ABCA8, and ABCA9, ABCA10 has a PEST
sequence between its N-terminal transmembrane domain and
nucleotide-binding fold. Wenzel et al. (2003) also identified 4 ABCA10
splice variants, 3 of which have altered reading frames. RNA dot blot
analysis detected ABCA10 expression in all tissues examined, with
highest levels in heart, brain, and gastrointestinal tract.

GENE FUNCTION

Wenzel et al. (2003) showed that expression of ABCA10 mRNA was unchanged
during differentiation of human monocytes into macrophages. Loading of
macrophages with low density lipoproteins suppressed ABCA10 expression,
whereas high density lipoprotein-mediated cholesterol export induced
upregulation of ABCA10 mRNA.

GENE STRUCTURE

Wenzel et al. (2003) determined that the ABCA10 gene spans 97 kb and
contains 41 exons, including an alternative exon 4 that is used in a
truncated ABCA10 splice variant.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Wenzel et al. (2003) mapped the ABCA10
gene to chromosome 17q24.3. It is clustered with ABCA5 (612503), ABCA6,
ABCA8, and ABCA9.

614574	TITLE *614574 ROGDI, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF; ROGDI
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The ROGDI gene encodes a leucine-zipper protein with high expression in
the human brain and spinal cord (Mory et al., 2012).

CLONING

Schossig et al. (2012) identified the ROGDI gene within a region of
chromosome 16 linked to Kohlschutter-Tonz syndrome (226750). The deduced
287-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 32 kD and is
predicted to fold into a globular structure. Quantitative RT-PCR
detected ROGDI expression in all 22 tissues examined, with highest
expression in spinal cord, followed by brain, heart, and bone marrow,
and weakest expression in thymus, testis, and lymphocytes. Expression in
fetal brain was much lower than that in adult brain.

Mory et al. (2012) found wide expression of the ROGDI gene in multiple
human tissues, including adult brain, spinal cord, peripheral blood,
heart, and bone marrow. Highest expression was in the spinal cord and
brain. Lower expression was found in many other tissues, including fetal
brain. Immunohistochemical studies in HEK293 cells, blood mononuclear
cells, and fibroblasts showed that the ROGDI protein was mainly
expressed in the nucleus and at the nuclear envelope.

GENE STRUCTURE

Schossig et al. (2012) determined that the ROGDI gene contains 11 exons
and spans over 5.98 kb. All exons are coding.

MAPPING

Schossig et al. (2012) stated that the ROGDI gene maps to chromosome
16p13.3.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of 3 unrelated families with Kohlschutter-Tonz
syndrome (KTZS; 226750), Schossig et al. (2012) identified homozygous or
compound heterozygous mutations in the ROGDI gene
(614574.0001-614574.0004). The mutation in the first family (Schossig et
al., 2007) was identified by linkage analysis and autozygosity mapping
followed by whole-exome sequencing with confirmation by Sanger
sequencing. The second patient had previously been reported by
Haberlandt et al. (2006), and the third patient was found to be a
distant relative of the original family reported by Kohlschutter et al.
(1974). All the mutations were expected to be null, likely causing
complete loss of protein function. The disorder was characterized by
early-onset seizures, severe psychomotor retardation, spasticity, and
amelogenesis imperfecta. Simultaneously and independently, Mory et al.
(2012) identified a common truncating mutation in the ROGDI gene (R157X;
614574.0005) in 14 patients from 5 Druze families with KTZS. Three of
the families were part of a large consanguineous kindred, and all the
families originated from the same small village in northern Israel. All
unaffected parents and sibs were heterozygous for the mutation, which
was found in heterozygous state in 10 of 100 unaffected Druze
individuals from the same community. Although the phenotype was
consistent, it was variable. All patients had seizures, severe global
developmental delay, spasticity and amelogenesis imperfecta. The
severity of intellectual disability was related to the severity of the
seizures, and the disorder could thus be considered an epileptic
encephalopathy. Both Schossig et al. (2012) and Mory et al. (2012) noted
that yeast 2-hybrid screens had suggested an interaction between ROGDI
and DISC1 (605210), a protein involved in cytoskeletal stability,
neuronal migration, intracellular transport, and cell division (Camargo
et al., 2007).

Using a combination of whole-exome sequencing, linkage analysis, and
Sanger sequencing, Tucci et al. (2013) identified 4 different biallelic
mutations in the ROGDI gene (see, e.g., 614574.0006-614574.0008) in
affected members of 5 families with KTZS. These patients presented with
typical core features of the disorder. In contrast, ROGDI mutations were
not identified in 5 additional families with a similar phenotype, but
who showed atypical features. Tucci et al. (2013) noted that the
findings confirmed the reports of Schossig et al. (2012) and Mory et al.
(2012) that loss-of-function variants cause the disorder. However, the
report also suggested genetic heterogeneity of atypical forms of the
disease.

KOHLSCHUTTER-TONZ SYNDROME
ROGDI, 2-BP DEL, 229CT

In 2 Moroccan sibs with Kohlschutter-Tonz syndrome (KTZS; 226750)
originally reported by Schossig et al. (2007), Schossig et al. (2012)
identified a homozygous 2-bp deletion (229_230delCT) in exon 4 of the
ROGDI gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature termination. The
consanguineous, unaffected parents were heterozygous for the mutation,
which was not found in the 1000 Genomes Project. The mutation was
identified by linkage analysis and autozygosity mapping followed by
whole-exome sequencing, with confirmation by Sanger sequencing.

ROGDI, GLN96TER

In an 18-year-old Austrian boy with Kohlschutter-Tonz syndrome (226750)
originally reported by Haberlandt et al. (2006), Schossig et al. (2012)
identified a homozygous 286C-T transition in exon 5 of the ROGDI gene,
resulting in a gln96-to-ter (Q96X) substitution and nonsense-mediated
mRNA decay. Each unaffected parent was heterozygous for the mutation.

.0003
KOHLSCHUTTER-TONZ SYNDROME
ROGDI, IVS7DS, G-C, +5

In a 9-year-old girl, born of distantly related parents, with
Kohlschutter-Tonz syndrome (226750), Schossig et al. (2012) identified
compound heterozygosity for 2 splice site mutations in intron 7 of the
ROGDI gene: a G-to-C transversion in the donor site (531+5G-C) inherited
from the father and an A-to-T transition in the acceptor site (532-2A-T;
614574.0004) inherited from the mother. RNA and cDNA analysis showed
that the 531+5G-C mutation caused an in-frame deletion of exon 7,
whereas the 532-2A-T mutation resulted in an aberrant transcript with
the inclusion of an additional 83 nucleotides before exon 8 and
ultimately followed by a stop codon; this transcript was subject to
nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Genealogic studies revealed that the girl
was distantly related to the mother of the affected individual
originally reported by Kohlschutter et al. (1974) via both the maternal
line (6 generations ago) and the paternal line (9 generations ago).
Heterozygosity for the 532-2A-T mutation was found in the unaffected
mother and sibs of the patient reported by Kohlschutter et al. (1974).
The findings suggested a common ancestor who lived in the Swiss valley
of Schachental in the 18th century.

In 14 patients from 5 Druze families with KTZS (226750), Mory et al.
(2012) identified a homozygous 469C-T transition in exon 7 of the RODGI
gene, resulting in an arg157-to-ter (R157X) substitution and causing
deletion of the highly conserved C-terminal domain. Three of the
families were part of a large consanguineous kindred, and all the
families originated from the same small village in northern Israel. All
unaffected parents and sibs were heterozygous for the mutation, which
was found in heterozygous state in 10 of 100 unaffected Druze
individuals from the same community. The mutation was not found in 100
Druze individuals from other parts of Israel or in the Exome Variant
Server. Although the phenotype was consistent, it was variable. All
patients had seizures, severe global developmental delay, spasticity and
amelogenesis imperfecta. The severity of intellectual disability was
related to the severity of the seizures, and the disorder could thus be
considered an epileptic encephalopathy.

KOHLSCHUTTER-TONZ SYNDROME
ROGDI, 1-BP DEL, 507C

In affected members of a Sicilian family with KTZS (226750) originally
reported by Christodoulou et al. (1988), Tucci et al. (2013) identified
a homozygous 1-bp deletion (507delC) in the ROGDI gene, resulting in a
frameshift and premature termination (Glu170ArgfsTer72). The mutation
was identified by homozygosity mapping combined with whole-exome
sequencing. The same homozygous mutation was found in a patient from
Germany with the disorder. The unaffected parents were heterozygous for
the mutation. RT-PCT analysis of patient cells indicated that the mutant
transcript was subject to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay.

In 2 sibs, born of consanguineous Sicilian parents, with KTZS (226750)

identified a homozygous deletion in intron 1 of the ROGDI gene
(46-37_46-30del). Each unaffected parent was heterozygous for the
deletion, which was identified by Sanger sequencing. The deletion was
confirmed through fragment analysis. Tucci et al. (2013) noted that the
deletion was not detected by exome sequencing.

ROGDI, 12-BP DEL, INTRON 1

In 2 sibs, born of unrelated German parents, with KTZS (226750)
originally reported by Petermoller et al. (1993), Tucci et al. (2013)
identified a homozygous 12-bp deletion in intron 1 of the ROGDI gene
(45+9_45+20del). Each unaffected parent was heterozygous for the
deletion, which was identified by Sanger sequencing. The deletion was
confirmed through fragment analysis. Analysis of RT-PCR products showed
that the deletion caused retention of the mutated 61-bp intron 1 lacking
the 12 deleted basepairs, prevented recognition of intron 1 by the
splicing machinery, and resulted in a frameshift and premature
termination in exon 3 (Glu16ValfsTer57).

17q11.2 a cluster of chemokines from the CC family (characterized by a
cys-cys sequence motif) and distinguished from a second chemokine family
that features a cys-xxx-cys (CXC) motif (see 173460). They mapped 1 gene
of the CC family (called NCC1 by them) to the cluster using a panel of
somatic cell hybrids with known deletions. NCC1 was originally
characterized as an expressed sequence tag (EST). The deduced order of

607183	TITLE *607183 SEC24-RELATED GENE FAMILY, MEMBER A; SEC24A
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

In yeast, the Sec23-Sec24 complex is a component of coat protein II
(COPII; see 601924)-coated vesicles that mediate protein transport from
the endoplasmic reticulum. SEC24A is 1 of several mammalian proteins
that show structural and functional homology to yeast Sec24.

CLONING

By searching an EST database for homologs of yeast Sec24 proteins,
screening a size-selected B-lymphocyte cDNA library, and 5-prime RACE,
Pagano et al. (1999) isolated a cDNA encoding SEC24A. The deduced
1,078-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of about 118
kD. Pagano et al. (1999) noted, however, that the sequence is likely
incomplete because it lacks the initiator ATG. RNase protection assays
demonstrated that SEC24A, SEC24B (607184), and SEC24C (607185) were
expressed simultaneously in several cell lines, including lines
originating from fibroblasts, hepatocytes, and lymphocytes. The major
difference in expression was a constant 2- to 3-fold lower level of
expression of SEC24B compared with SEC24A and SEC24C.

Tang et al. (1999) determined that SEC24A and SEC24B share about 56%
sequence identity, while SEC24C and SEC24D (607186) share about 52%
identity. However, the identity shared between these 2 pairs is only
about 20%.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the SEC24A
gene to chromosome 5 (TMAP stSG9839).

;;CHAC GENE; CHAC;;
CHOREIN;;
KIAA0986
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

In the choreoacanthocytosis (200150) critical region on chromosome 9q,
Rampoldi et al. (2001) identified the VPS13A gene, which they called
CHAC. They identified 2 splice variants: transcript A, which contains
exons 1 to 68 and 70 to 73 and encodes a 3,174-amino acid protein, and
transcript B, which contains exons 1 to 69 and encodes a 3,095-amino
acid protein. Northern blot analysis detected 2 bands of high molecular
mass corresponding to the 2 splice variants in all tissues analyzed.
Additionally, RT-PCR detected expression in the erythrocyte precursor
cell line K562. Rampoldi et al. (2001) showed that the CHAC gene encodes
an evolutionarily conserved protein, which may be involved in protein
sorting.

Independently, Ueno et al. (2001) identified the VPS13A gene and found
that it encodes a 3,096-amino acid protein, which they termed chorein.
Northern blot analysis detected a 10-kb transcript in brain, heart,
skeletal muscle, and kidney.

By EST database analysis and RT-PCR of lymphoid cell line and brain RNA,
Velayos-Baeza et al. (2004) identified several additional splice
variants of VPS13A generated by exon skipping or utilization of
alternative internal exons. Northern blot analysis and RT-PCR detected
VPS13A expression at variable levels in all tissues examined, and
transcript encoding the 3,174-amino acid protein was the major variant.

GENE STRUCTURE

Rampoldi et al. (2001) determined that the VPS13A gene contains 73 exons
and spans 250 kb. Velayos-Baeza et al. (2004) identified 5 additional
alternative exons in the VPS13A gene, exons 7b, 31b, 34b, 68b, and 69b,
but 3 of these, exons 31b, 34b, and 69b, have stop codons in all 3
reading frames.

MAPPING

Rampoldi et al. (2001) mapped the VPS13A gene to chromosome 9q21-q22.
Velayos-Baeza et al. (2004) mapped the mouse Vps13a gene to chromosome
19A.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of 11 families with choreoacanthocytosis, Rampoldi
et al. (2001) identified 16 different mutations in the VPS13A gene (see,
e.g., 605978.0001).

In 4 affected patients from 3 Japanese pedigrees with
choreoacanthocytosis, Ueno et al. (2001) identified a homozygous
deletion in the coding region of the VPS13A gene (605978.0003).

Among 43 patients with choreoacanthocytosis, Dobson-Stone et al. (2002)
identified 57 different mutations distributed throughout the CHAC gene
(see, e.g., 605978.0004). In 7 patients, only 1 heterozygous mutation
was found; in 4 patients, no disease mutations were found. The authors
noted that small gene deletions or rearrangements may not have been
detected in these patients.

Dobson-Stone et al. (2005) stated that 75 different mutations in the
VPS13A gene had been identified in 58 probands with
choreoacanthocytosis.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CHOREOACANTHOCYTOSIS
VPS13A, ILE90LYS

In a patient with choreoacanthocytosis (200150), Rampoldi et al. (2001)
found compound heterozygosity for a 269T-A transversion in exon 4 of the
VPS13A gene and an insertion of a T between nucleotides 6404 and 6405 in
exon 48. The mutations resulted in an ile90-to-lys (I90K) amino acid
change and a frameshift, respectively.

.0003
CHOREOACANTHOCYTOSIS
VPS13A, 260-BP DEL

In affected members of 3 Japanese families with choreoacanthocytosis
(200150), Ueno et al. (2001) identified a homozygous 260-bp deletion in
the VPS13A gene, leading to a truncated protein. The families originated
from a small area in Japan, and haplotype analysis indicated a founder
effect. Some of the patients' parents, who were heterozygous for the
mutation, showed a slight degree of acanthocytosis in peripheral blood
but no distinct neurologic abnormalities except for cryptogenic abducens
palsy in 1 parent.

.0004
CHOREOACANTHOCYTOSIS
VPS13A, ARG208TER

In 3 patients with choreoacanthocytosis, Dobson-Stone et al. (2002)
identified a 622C-T change in exon 9 of the CHAC gene, resulting in an
arg208-to-ter nonsense substitution (R208X). One patient was homozygous
for the mutation and 2 others were compound heterozygous for R208X and
another CHAC mutation. The R208X mutation had previously been reported
by Rampoldi et al. (2001) in a family with choreoacanthocytosis.

.0005
CHOREOACANTHOCYTOSIS
VPS13A, 8035G-A

In 2 affected sibs from a Japanese family with choreoacanthocytosis
(200150) with apparent autosomal dominant inheritance, Saiki et al.
(2003) identified a heterozygous G-to-A transversion at the last
nucleotide of exon 57 of the CHAC gene, predicted to induce skipping of
exon 57 and premature termination of the protein. The mutation was not
detected in their unaffected mother. Family history revealed that 3
other living family members were affected and 2 deceased members were
believed to be affected. All 5 living affected members showed
acanthocytosis (approximately 15-20%) and involuntary movements. In an
erratum, the authors stated that an error in sequencing had occurred and
the inheritance pattern should have been reported as autosomal recessive
(pseudodominant). Tomiyasu et al. (2011) identified the 2 mutations in
the VPS13A gene in this family: an 8035G-A transition in exon 57,
causing a frameshift and premature termination (Ile2652HisfsTer12), and
a 1305G-A transition in exon 15, resulting in a trp435-to-ter (W435X;
605978.0010) substitution; the latter mutation was also identified in
the unaffected mother.

.0006
CHOREOACANTHOCYTOSIS
VPS13A, 1-BP DEL, 6059C

In 2 unrelated males of Ashkenazi Jewish descent with
choreoacanthocytosis (200150), Lossos et al. (2005) identified a
homozygous 1-bp deletion (6059delC) in exon 46 of the VPS13A gene,
predicted to result in premature termination of the protein.

.0007
CHOREOACANTHOCYTOSIS
VPS13A, 7-KB DEL

In an Iraqi Jewish woman with choreoacanthocytosis (200150), Lossos et
al. (2005) identified a homozygous 7-kb deletion spanning exon 23 of the
VPS13A gene. She had trichotillomania and anxiety but little
neuromuscular involvement.

.0008
CHOREOACANTHOCYTOSIS
VPS13A, 37-KB DEL

In affected members of 3 French Canadian families with
choreoacanthocytosis (200150), Dobson-Stone et al. (2005) identified a
homozygous 37-kb deletion in the VPS13A gene, resulting in the deletion
of exons 70 through 73. The deletion also encompassed the 2 terminal
exons of the neighboring GNA14 gene (604397). Haplotype analysis
indicated a founder effect.

.0009
CHOREOACANTHOCYTOSIS
VPS13A, 2-BP DUP, 3556AC

In 2 Mexican mestizo sisters, born of consanguineous parents, with
choreoacanthocytosis (200150), Ruiz-Sandoval et al. (2007) identified a
homozygous 2-bp duplication (3556dupAC) in exon 33 of the VPS13A gene,
resulting in a frameshift and premature termination. The proband had
onset at age 32 years and showed severe progression of the disorder; at
age 42, she was emaciated, anarthric, and reactive only to simple
commands. In contrast, her sister had onset at age 45 years and
primarily showed motor and verbal tics, paranoid behavior, and
depression.

609559	TITLE *609559 CALMODULIN LYSINE N-METHYLTRANSFERASE; CAMKMT
;;CHROMOSOME 2 OPEN READING FRAME 34; C2ORF34
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Methyltransferases catalyze the transfer of a methyl group from a donor,
generally S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet), to acceptor molecules,
including proteins, DNA, RNA, lipids, and small metabolites. CAMKMT
belongs to a family of protein lysine methyltransferases that methylate
nonhistone proteins (Cloutier et al., 2013).

CLONING

Parvari et al. (2005) identified C2ORF34 as one of the genes affected by
a homozygous deletion of 179 kb on chromosome 2, which results in the
2p21 deletion syndrome (606407). C2ORF34 is alternatively spliced,
producing short and long variants that contain 4 and 11 exons,
respectively; the first 3 exons are shared by the 2 variants. The short
variant encodes a predicted 132-amino acid cytoplasmic protein, and the
long variant encodes a predicted transmembrane protein with a
cytoplasmic C terminus. RT-PCR analysis detected expression of the short
variant in colon, testis, kidney, and brain. The long variant was
expressed in all tissues tested except testis and kidney.

By searching databases for sequences similar to METTL22 (615261),
Cloutier et al. (2013) identified CAMKMT. The deduced protein is made up
predominantly of a Rossmann fold of alternating beta strands and alpha
helices, with a conserved AdoMet-binding site near the N terminus.
Epitope-tagged CAMKMT was predominantly expressed in a diffuse
cytoplasmic distribution in transfected HeLa cells.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Parvari et al. (2005) mapped the C2ORF34
gene to chromosome 2p21.

GENE FUNCTION

By affinity purification, SDS-PAGE, and mass spectrometry, Cloutier et
al. (2013) found that CAMKMT expressed in HEK293 cells interacted with
tubulin (see 602529). HSP90 (see 140571) and HSP70 (see 140550) were
also detected in the immunoprecipitate.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Parvari et al. (2005) determined that the first exon and 300 bp of the
first intron of C2ORF34 are deleted in the homozygous 2p21 deletion
syndrome (606407). RT-PCR showed that C2ORF34 was not expressed in
lymphoblastoid cells from patients with the syndrome, whereas both
C2ORF34 splice variants were expressed in control cells.

611810	TITLE *611810 USH1C-BINDING PROTEIN 1; USHBP1
;;MUTATED IN COLON CANCER 2; MCC2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By yeast 2-hybrid screening of a human placenta cDNA library with USH1C
(605242) as bait, followed by screening a human intestine cDNA library
and RT-PCR of human kidney RNA, Ishikawa et al. (2001) cloned USHBP1,
which they called MCC2. The deduced 703-amino acid protein contains a
PDZ domain-binding motif and shares homology with the coiled-coil
regions of MCC1 (159350). Northern blot analysis detected 2.4- and
3.5-kb transcripts with highest expression in heart and moderate to low
expression in skeletal muscle, kidney, liver, small intestine, placenta,
and lung. The 3.5-kb transcript represented a splice variant, resulting
in premature termination and a deduced 68-amino acid peptide. Yeast
2-hybrid analysis confirmed the interaction between USHBP1 and the PDZ
domain of USH1C, and RT-PCR analysis showed low to no expression of
USHBP1 in 32 cancer cell lines tested.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ishikawa et al. (2001) determined that the USHBP1 gene contains 9 exons.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid panel analysis, Ishikawa et al. (2001) mapped the
USHBP1 gene to chromosome 19p13.1.

;;GUANYLATE KINASE-ASSOCIATED KINESIN; GAKIN;;
KIAA0639
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By randomly sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain
cDNA library, Ishikawa et al. (1998) cloned a partial cDNA encoding
KIF13B, which they called KIAA0639. RT-PCR detected high levels of
KIF13B expression in all tissues examined.

Hanada et al. (2000) identified KIF13B, which they called GAKIN, as a
250-kD phosphoprotein that interacted with DLG1 (601014) in Jurkat T
cells. By peptide sequencing, EST database searching, amplification, and
conventional cloning, they obtained a full-length KIF13B cDNA from a
fetal brain cDNA library. The deduced 1,826-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 203 kD. KIF13B contains a consensus
ATP/GTP-binding motif within its N-terminal motor domain; a stalk domain
containing several short alpha-helical segments; and a CAP-gly motif in
its C terminus characteristic of microtubule-based cytoskeleton
components. KIF13B has several putative serine/threonine phosphorylation
sites and a putative tyrosine phosphorylation site. The N-terminal motor
domain of KIF13B shares 98% identity with the motor domain of mouse
Kif13b. Northern blot analysis revealed a single 8.5-kb transcript in
all tissues tested, with highest abundance in kidney, pancreas, brain,
and testis. Western blot analysis of Jurkat T cells revealed an apparent
molecular mass of 250 kD, and immunolocalization revealed a punctate,
cytoplasmic distribution in resting T cells.

NOMENCLATURE

Lawrence et al. (2004) presented a standardized kinesin nomenclature
based on 14 family designations. Under this system, KIF13B belongs to
the kinesin-3 family.

GENE FUNCTION

Using in vitro pull-down assays and coimmunoprecipitation experiments,
Hanada et al. (2000) confirmed the interaction between KIF13B and DLG1.
Mutation analysis indicated that a segment of the KIF13B stalk domain in
close proximity to the motor domain is required for binding with DLG1.
KIF13B also bound the guanylate kinase-like domain of PSD95 (DLG4;
602887), but not that of p55 (MPP1; 305360).

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Ishikawa et al. (1998) mapped the KIF13B
gene to chromosome 8.

Gross (2012) mapped the KIF13B gene to chromosome 8p12 based on an
alignment of the KIF13B sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF279865) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

118445	TITLE *118445 CHOLECYSTOKININ B RECEPTOR; CCKBR
;;GASTRIN RECEPTOR; GASR
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The cholecystokinin (CCK) family of peptides (see 118440) and their
receptors are widely distributed throughout the central nervous system
and gastrointestinal tract. The receptors can be divided into 2 subtypes
on the basis of their affinity for nonsulfated analogs of CCK. Type A
receptors, which have a high affinity only for sulfated CCK-8, are found
principally in the gastrointestinal tract and select areas of the CNS,
while type B (gastrin) receptors, having a high affinity for both
sulfated and nonsulfated CCK analogs, are found principally in the CNS
and select areas of the gastrointestinal tract. Highly selective,
nonpeptide antagonists have been developed that support this subtype
classification. In the CNS, type B receptors regulate anxiety, arousal,
neuroleptic activity, and opiate-induced analgesia. Outside the CNS,
they regulate gastric acid secretion and may play a role in
gastrointestinal motility and growth of normal and neoplastic
gastrointestinal tissue. The CCKB/gastrin receptor (CCKBR) can
selectively be blocked by nonpeptide benzodiazepine-based antagonists.
Beinborn et al. (1993) found that a single amino acid, valine-349, is
critical in determining the binding affinity for these nonpeptide
antagonists. They showed that it is the variability in the aliphatic
side chain of the amino acid in position 349 that confers antagonist
specificity and concluded that the residues underlying nonpeptide
antagonist affinity must differ from those that confer against
specificity.

CLONING

Pisegna et al. (1992) used a rat type B receptor cDNA to isolate cDNA
for human CCKBR. The deduced 447-amino acid protein shares 90% identity
to both rat type B CCK receptor and canine gastrin receptor. Northern
hybridization identified transcripts in stomach, pancreas, brain, and
gallbladder. Expression of the receptor of the cDNA in COS-7 cells was
characteristic of a type B CCK receptor pharmacology.

Lee et al. (1993) presented Southern blot hybridization analyses of
human genomic DNA indicating that a single gene encodes both the brain
and the stomach CCK-B/gastrin receptors. They presented other data
indicating that the receptors of the brain and stomach are identical and
that a distinction between them is not valid.

MAPPING

Using a somatic cell hybrid panel of human/hamster DNAs and Southern
blot analysis, Pisegna et al. (1992) demonstrated that the CCKBR gene is
located on chromosome 11. Zimonjic et al. (1994) assigned the CCKBR gene
to 11p15.5-p15.4 by in situ hybridization.

Samuelson et al. (1995) mapped the mouse Cckbr to chromosome 7, tightly
linked to the beta-globin locus (Hbb). This localization placed Cckbr in
the same region as the mouse obesity mutation tubby (tub). Since CCK can
function as a satiety factor when administered to rodents, localization
of Cckbr near the tub mutation identifies this receptor as a candidate
gene for the obesity mutation. Huppi et al. (1995) likewise mapped the
CCKBR gene to human chromosome 11 and distal mouse chromosome 7.

ANIMAL MODEL

In a study of osteopetrotic mouse models (see Src, 190090, and Tcirg1,
604592), Schinke et al. (2009) generated Cckbr -/- mice and observed the
expected hypochlorhydria, but also secondary hyperparathyroidism,
osteoporosis, and modest hypocalcemia, suggesting that alterations in
calcium homeostasis can be driven by defects in gastric acidification.
Mice with a combined deficiency of both Cckbr and Src developed
osteopetrorickets, a phenotype involving rachitic widening of the growth
plates, pathologic increase of the osteoid volume, and early lethality
that is seen in Tcirg1-deficient (oc/oc) mice but not in Cckbr -/- mice
or Src -/- mice. Schinke et al. (2009) concluded that osteopetrosis and
osteopetrorickets are distinct phenotypes, depending on the site or
sites of defective acidification.

;;RAS-GTPase-ACTIVATING PROTEIN SH3 DOMAIN-BINDING PROTEIN;;
GAP SH3 DOMAIN-BINDING PROTEIN; G3BP;;
HUMAN DNA HELICASE VIII;;
HDH-VIII
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Parker et al. (1996) identified G3bp through its binding to the SH3
domain of GAP (RASA1; 139150) in lysates of exponentially growing
Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts engineered to overexpress human
epidermal growth factor receptor (131550). By PCR using primers designed
from the peptide sequence, followed by screening a placenta cDNA library
screening, they cloned human G3BP. The deduced 466-amino acid protein
has a calculated molecular mass of 52 kD. G3BP contains an acid-rich
amino acid domain between amino acids 144 and 221, followed by 2
consensus RNA-binding motifs and several C-terminal arg/gly-rich boxes,
which are also implicated in RNA binding. Northern blot analysis
detected a 3.3-kb G3BP transcript in all fetal and adult tissues
examined, with prominent expression in adult skeletal muscle.
Immunofluorescence analysis of several mammalian cell lines localized
G3BP within the cytoplasm. The staining intensity varied between cells,
but the intensity and localization were unaltered under various
experimental conditions. G3bp purified from Chinese hamster lung
fibroblasts and recombinant G3BP expressed in insect cells both showed
apparent molecular masses of 68 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

Parker et al. (1996) confirmed that recombinant G3BP expressed in insect
cells bound to the SH3 domain of GAP. G3BP coimmunoprecipitated with GAP
only when cells were proliferating. Parker et al. (1996) concluded that
recruitment of the GAP-G3BP complex occurs only when Ras (190020) is in
its activated conformation.

Costa et al. (1999) purified human G3BP, which they called HDH-VIII, in
a systematic study of DNA-unwinding enzymes present in HeLa cells. They
found that G3BP could unwind DNA and RNA partial duplexes in an ATP- and
Mg(2+)-dependent manner, even though it lacks the canonical helicase
domain. G3BP preferentially unwound partial duplex substrates having a
17-bp annealed portion and either a hanging 3-prime tail or hanging
tails at both the 3-prime and 5-prime ends. It unwound DNA/DNA, RNA/DNA,
and RNA/RNA substrates with comparable efficiency. G3BP failed to unwind
a substrate with a 40-bp annealed section. It appeared to unwind
unidirectionally by moving in the 5-prime-to-3-prime direction along the
bound single-stranded DNA.

Tourriere et al. (2003) found that endogenous G3bp localized in large
cytoplasmic structures resembling stress granules (SGs) in COS cells
following exposure to either arsenite or high temperature. They found
that the N-terminal NTF2 (605813)-like domain and the RNA-binding
domains of G3BP mediated its recruitment to SGs. Overexpression of G3BP
induced SG assembly, whereas overexpression of only the central
RasGAP-binding domain inhibited SG assembly. Within the RasGAP-binding
domain, dephosphorylation of a critical serine (ser149) was induced by
arsenite treatments. A phosphomimetic mutant at this position failed to
oligomerize and to assemble SGs, whereas a nonphosphorylatable G3BP
mutant did both. Tourriere et al. (2003) concluded that G3BP is an
effector of SG assembly and that Ras signaling contributes to this
process by regulating G3BP dephosphorylation.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the G3BP
gene to chromosome 5 (TMAP SHGC-133085).

603514	TITLE *603514 RNA GUANINE-7-METHYLTRANSFERASE; RNMT
;;MET
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

In mammals, 5-prime-terminal caps are formed on nascent pre-mRNAs by the
sequential action of 2 enzymes, the bifunctional capping enzyme RNGTT
(603512) and RNA guanine-7-methyltransferase (RNMT). RNGTT catalyzes the
removal of the gamma-phosphate of the initiating nucleotide and
transfers GMP from GTP to the resulting diphosphate end. RNMT catalyzes
the subsequent N7 methylation of the newly formed termini. The terminal
7-methylguanosine is recognized by cap-binding proteins that facilitate
key events in gene expression (summary by Pillutla et al., 1998).

CLONING

By searching an EST database for sequences homologous to that of S.
cerevisiae RNA guanine-7-methyltransferase, Pillutla et al. (1998)
identified a human cDNA encoding RNMT, which they called MET. The
predicted 476-amino acid MET protein contains several conserved motifs
known to be required for methyltransferase activity.

By screening human brain cDNAs for those encoding large proteins,
Ishikawa et al. (1997) identified KIAA0398, an RNMT cDNA.

Tsukamoto et al. (1998) isolated 3 human cDNAs encoding RNMT, which they
termed HCMT1a, HCMT1b, and HCMT1c, which appear to be produced by
alternative splicing. HCMT1a and HCMT1b encode deduced proteins of 476
and 504 amino acids, respectively, and differ only in the region
encoding the C-terminal portion of the enzyme after residue 465. HCMT1c
appears to encode the same polypeptide as HCMT1a; however, the 3-prime
noncoding region of HCMT1c contains sequences corresponding to portions
of both HCMT1a and HCMT1b. RT-PCR detected expression of the 3 mRNAs in
all tissues tested.

GENE FUNCTION

Pillutla et al. (1998) found that recombinant human MET exhibited RNA
guanine-7-methyltransferase activity in vitro and formed ternary
complexes with RNGTT and the elongating form of RNA polymerase II.

Tsukamoto et al. (1998) showed that recombinant human HCMT1a expressed
in E. coli exhibited mRNA RNMT activity, whereas recombinant HCMT1b did
not.

Using immunoprecipitation analysis, Gonatopoulos-Pournatzis et al.
(2011) found that RAM (FAM103A1; 614547) interacted with RNMT1 in
several human cell lines. Gel filtration of HeLa cell extracts detected
RAM and RNMT in a high molecular mass complex of about 200 kD. No RAM or
RNMT monomers were detected. RNA band-shift assays showed that RAM, but
not RNMT, interacted with RNA rather than the cap structure. Thin layer
chromatography and quantitative phosphoimaging showed that recombinant
RNMT, but not RAM, catalyzed methylation of the cap in a dose-dependent
manner. Addition of RAM increased the cap methyltransferase activity of
RNMT, and equimolar concentrations of RAM and RNMT resulted in highest
cap methyltransferase activity. Mutation analysis revealed that amino
acids 1 to 55 of RAM interacted with the methyltransferase domain of
RNMT and were sufficient to activate RNMT-dependent cap methylation. The
asn- and arg-rich region of RAM (amino acids 56 to 90) bound RNA.
Knockdown of RAM in HeLa cells via small interfering RNA resulted in
loss of RNMT expression and loss of cap methyltransferase activity.
Knockdown of RAM also caused loss of polysomes and reduced protein
synthesis, consistent with loss of mRNA translation. Knockdown of RNMT
caused loss of RAM expression, suggesting that the 2 proteins stabilize
each other. Gonatopoulos-Pournatzis et al. (2011) concluded that RAM is
essential for RNMT cap methyltransferase activity.

MAPPING

By analysis of a radiation hybrid panel, Pillutla et al. (1998) and
Ishikawa et al. (1997) mapped the RNMT gene to chromosome 18. Pillutla
et al. (1998) refined the location to 18p11.23-p11.22 using fluorescence
in situ hybridization.

613018	TITLE *613018 TYROSINE AMINOTRANSFERASE; TAT
;;TAT, SOLUBLE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT; EC 2.6.1.5) is a liver-specific enzyme
that converts tyrosine to p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate in a pyridoxal
phosphate-dependent transamination reaction (Rettenmeier et al., 1990).

CLONING

The TAT gene encodes a deduced 454-amino acid protein with a molecular
mass of 50,399 daltons (Rettenmeier et al., 1990).

GENE STRUCTURE

By analysis of cDNA and genomic clones, Rettenmeier et al. (1990)
determined that the TAT gene extends over 10.9 kb and contains 12 exons
giving rise to an mRNA that is 2,754 nucleotides long, excluding the
poly(A) tail. The noncoding region of the 3-prime exon contains a
complete Alu element.

MAPPING

Barton et al. (1986) assigned the tyrosine aminotransferase gene to
16q22-q24 by means of a gene clone in somatic cell hybrid analysis and
in situ hybridization. Natt et al. (1986) confirmed the assignment to
chromosome 16. The assignment is also supported by homology to the
mouse. Muller et al. (1985) assigned the TAT locus to mouse chromosome 8
which carries 6 other loci that are on human 16: APRT (102600), CTRB
(118890), HP (140100), GOT2 (138150), MT1 (156350), and MT2 (156360).
All are on human 16q.

Natt et al. (1987) narrowed the assignment of TAT to 16q22.1-q22.3.

Schmid et al. (1985) identified a regulatory locus near the albino locus
on mouse chromosome 7 that affects the level of Tat mRNA.

GENE FUNCTION

Killary and Fournier (1984) studied extinction of liver-specific
tyrosine aminotransferase when rat hepatoma cells were fused with mouse
fibroblasts. By microcell hybrids, they showed that mouse chromosome 11
was specifically responsible for extinction and that homologous human
chromosome 17 had the same activity. The Tse1 gene (PRKAR1A; 188830) in
the mouse represses gene expression in trans. To search for other
Tse1-responsive genes, Lem et al. (1988) screened for expression of
liver-specific mRNAs in hepatoma microcell hybrids containing mouse
chromosome 11 or human chromosome 17. Whereas most liver gene activity
was unaffected in such hybrids, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase
(261650, 261680) and tyrosine aminotransferase gene expression was
coordinately repressed in these clones. Extinction of both genes was
apparently mediated by a single genetic locus on human chromosome 17.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

To identify the causative mutations in TAT alleles cloned from 3
patients with type II tyrosinemia (276600), Natt et al. (1992)
constructed chimeric genes from normal and mutant TAT alleles and tested
their ability to direct TAT activity in a transient expression assay.
DNA sequence analysis of the regions identified as nonfunctional
revealed 5 mutant alleles, one of which carried 2 different point
mutations (613018.0001-613018.0005).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
TYROSINEMIA, TYPE II
TAT, ARG57TER

In a French patient with tyrosinemia II (276600), Natt et al. (1992)
identified a CGA-to-TGA transition in the TAT gene, resulting in an
arg57-to-ter (R57X) substitution. The mutation was suspected to be
present in homozygous state because the patient's parents came from a
small village in Lombardy.

.0002
TYROSINEMIA, TYPE II
TAT, SER223TER

In a Japanese patient with type II tyrosinemia (276600), Natt et al.
(1992) identified compound heterozygosity for mutations in the TAT gene:
a TCA-to-TGA transversion resulting in a ser223-to-ter substitution
(S223X), and a splice site mutation in intron 2 (613018.0005).

.0003
TYROSINEMIA, TYPE II
TAT, ARG417TER

In a French patient with type II tyrosinemia (276600), Natt et al.
(1992) identified compound heterozygosity for a mutation in the TAT
gene: a CGA-to-TGA transition resulting in an arg417-to-ter substitution
(R417X) on one allele and a G362V missense mutation and a splice
mutation on the other (613018.0004).

.0004
TYROSINEMIA, TYPE II
TAT, IVS8DS, T-G, +2 AND GLY362VAL

In a French patient with tyrosinemia II (276600) who had an R417X
mutation on 1 allele (613018.0003) of the TAT gene, Natt et al. (1992)
identified 2 point mutations on the other allele: one was a missense
mutation, gly362-to-val (G362V), resulting from a GGA-to-GTA
transversion; the other was a mutation in the donor splice site of
intron 8 converting the second nucleotide from T to G. Identical
GT-to-GG splice donor mutations in the beta-globin gene and in the
factor IX gene lead to beta-0-thalassemia and severe hemophilia B,
respectively.

.0005
TYROSINEMIA, TYPE II
TAT, IVS2AS, A-G, -5

In a Japanese patient with type II tyrosinemia (276600), Natt et al.
(1992) identified compound heterozygosity for mutations in the TAT gene:
an S223X substitution (613018.0002) and an A-to-G transition in intron
2, creating a new splice acceptor site 4 nucleotides 5-prime to the
normal splice position. A new reading frame resulted, terminating at
codon 91/92 in exon C.

605947	TITLE *605947 PHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL GLYCAN, CLASS L; PIGL
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) is used as a membrane anchor by many
eukaryotic cell surface proteins. The first step in GPI biosynthesis
involves the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) from UDP-GlcNAc to
phosphatidylinositol (PI) (see PIGQ; 605754). The second step is
N-deacetylation of GlcNAc-PI. performed by PIGL (summary by Watanabe et
al., 1999).

CLONING

Using expression cloning, Nakamura et al. (1997) identified a rat gene,
which they called PIGL, that complemented the phenotype of a cell line
deficient in GlcNAc-PI N-deacetylation. By EST database searching with
the rat PIGL sequence, Watanabe et al. (1999) identified a human PIGL
cDNA and extended the 5-prime end using RACE. PIGL encodes a deduced
252-amino acid protein that shares 77% identity with the rat protein.
Using transfection into mammalian PIGL-deficient cells, Watanabe et al.
(1999) demonstrated that S. cerevisiae Gpi12 is the ortholog of human
and rat PIGL. Disruption of Gpi12 in yeast resulted in a lethal
phenotype. Using purified, recombinant rat PIGL, Watanabe et al. (1999)
demonstrated that PIGL has GlcNAc-PI N-deacetylase activity in vitro,
which is enhanced by metal ions. Nakamura et al. (1997) localized PIGL
to the cytoplasmic side of the endoplasmic reticulum.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the PIGL
gene to chromosome 17p12-p11.2 (TMAP WI-6323).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 6 unrelated individuals with CHIME syndrome (280000), also known as
Zunich neuroectodermal syndrome, Ng et al. (2012) identified compound
heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the PIGL gene. All patients carried a
founder missense mutation on 1 allele (L167P; 605947.0001). Five
patients carried a truncating mutation in the PIGL gene on the other
allele (605947.0002-605947.0004), whereas the sixth patient had a 1-Mb
deletion of chromosome 17p12-p11.2 including the PIGL gene on the other
allele. All of the patients had previously been reported (see, e.g.,
Zunich and Kaye, 1983, 1984; Zunich et al., 1985; Zunich et al., 1988;
Schnur et al., 1997; Shashi et al., 1995, and Tinschert et al., 1996).
The mutations were found by whole-exome sequencing and confirmed by
Sanger sequencing. Zunich neuroectodermal syndrome is an extremely rare
autosomal recessive multisystemic disorder clinically characterized by
colobomas, congenital heart defects, migratory ichthyosiform dermatosis,
mental retardation, and ear anomalies. Other clinical features include
distinctive facial features, abnormal growth, genitourinary
abnormalities, seizures, and feeding difficulties. Cell lines derived
from 2 patients showed deficiency of 2 GPI anchor markers, including
CD59 (107271), confirming that the disorder is due to a defect in PIGL.
Ng et al. (2012) noted that GPI anchor deficiencies cause remarkable
clinical diversity.

In 6 unrelated individuals with CHIME syndrome (280000), also known as
Zunich neuroectodermal syndrome, Ng et al. (2012) identified compound
heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the PIGL gene. All patients carried a
500T-C transition in exon 5, resulting in a leu167-to-pro (L167P)
substitution in a highly conserved residue in the catalytic domain on 1
allele, and a second pathogenic mutation in the PIGL gene on the other
allele. Two sibs previously reported by Zunich et al. (1988) had a 1-bp
deletion in exon 2 (274delC; 605947.0002), resulting in a frameshift and
premature termination, on the other allele. A patient reported by Shashi
et al. (1995) carried a 653C-T transition in exon 6, resulting in a
gln218-to-ter (Q218X; 605947.0003), on the other allele. Another patient
had a G-to-A transition in intron 3 (427-1G-A; 605947.0004), on the
other allele. Finally, a patient reported by Tinschert et al. (1996) had
a 1-Mb deletion of chromosome 17p12-p11.2 including the PIGL gene, on
the other allele. The heterozygous L167P mutation was found in 8 of
nearly 13,000 control alleles from 2 large public databases: the
National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Exome Sequencing
Project and the 1000 Genomes Project database. Since all patients were
of European ancestry, Ng et al. (2012) hypothesized a founder effect for
this variant, which was confirmed using microsatellite markers. All PIGL
mutations were identified by whole-exome sequencing and confirmed by
Sanger sequencing. Cell lines derived from 2 patients showed deficiency
of 2 GPI anchor markers, including CD59 (107271), confirming that the
disorder is due to a defect in PIGL.

601546	TITLE *601546 PROSPERO-RELATED HOMEOBOX 1; PROX1
;;HOMEOBOX GENE PROX1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Zinovieva et al. (1996) described the isolation of a human gene that is
homologous to the mouse Prox1 homeotic gene. PCR probes corresponding to
the mouse Prox1 gene were used to screen human genomic DNA libraries.
PCR probes corresponding to human PROX1 cDNA were used to screen fetal
brain cDNA libraries. Comparison of the human and chicken PROX1
nucleotide sequence demonstrated that they are highly conserved, with
overall homology of 94%. In the region of the homeodomain and the
prospero domain, the genes were identical. The prospero domain coincides
with a domain in a Drosophila gene that is expressed in Drosophila
central nervous system and in the developing lens-secreting cone cells
of the eye. Exon 1 of the human sequence showed no clear similarity to
the 3 alternatively spliced variants of chicken PROX1 cDNA. Human PROX1
exon 1 was found to contain repetitive sequences. Analysis of mRNA
revealed that Prox mRNA was present in many different human tissues and
that lens demonstrated the highest level. In all tissues but lens, PROX1
cDNA hybridized to a single band of 8 kb. In the embryonic lens an
additional component of 2 kb was present which appears to be derived by
alternative splicing. Zinovieva et al. (1996) noted that since the cDNA
isolated by them was only 2,924 bp and the mRNA transcript was 8.0 kb,
significant portions of the 5-prime and 3-prime untranslated regions of
the cDNA remained uncloned.

GENE STRUCTURE

Using combined analysis of cDNA and genomic DNA clones, Zinovieva et al.
(1996) found that the PROX1 gene is composed of at least 5 exons and 4
introns.

MAPPING

Zinovieva et al. (1996) mapped the PROX1 gene to chromosome 1 by
analysis of somatic cell hybrids. They also reported that the PROX1 gene
maps within a YAC contig that maps to chromosome 1q32.2-q32.3. Zinovieva
et al. (1996) reported that Usher syndrome type II (276901) maps close
to this region on chromosome 1 and that PROX1 can be considered as a
candidate gene for this disorder.

GENE FUNCTION

Wigle and Oliver (1999) reported that the Prox1 gene is expressed in a
subpopulation of endothelial cells that by budding and sprouting give
rise to the lymphatic system. The initial localization of these cells in
the veins and their subsequent budding were both polarized, suggesting
that unidentified guidance signals regulate this process. In Prox1-null
mice, budding and sprouting were arrested, although vasculogenesis and
angiogenesis of the vascular system were unaffected. These findings
suggested that Prox1 is a specific and required regulator of the
development of the lymphatic system and that the vascular and lymphatic
systems develop independently.

Several genes are required during the early phases of liver
specification, proliferation, and differentiation. Sosa-Pineda et al.
(2000) reported that Prox1 is required for hepatocyte migration in the
mouse. Loss of Prox1 led to formation of a smaller liver with a reduced
population of clustered hepatocytes surrounded by a laminin-rich basal
membrane.

Retinal progenitor cells regulate their proliferation during development
so that the correct number of each cell type is made at the appropriate
time. Dyer et al. (2003) found that the homeodomain protein Prox1
regulates the exit of progenitor cells from the cell cycle in the
embryonic mouse retina. Cells lacking Prox1 are less likely to stop
dividing, and ectopic expression of Prox1 forces progenitor cells to
exit the cell cycle. Other observations indicated that Prox1 activity is
both necessary and sufficient for progenitor-cell proliferation and
cell-fate determination in the vertebrate retina.

Francois et al. (2008) demonstrated that Sox18 (601618) acts as a
molecular switch to induce differentiation of lymphatic endothelial
cells. Sox18 is expressed in a subset of cardinal vein cells that later
coexpress Prox1 and migrate to form lymphatic vessels. Sox18 directly
activates Prox1 transcription by binding to its proximal promoter.

Johnson et al. (2008) showed that differentiation of lymphatic
endothelial cells in mice is a plastic and reprogrammable process that
depends on constant Prox1 activity. Small interfering RNA-mediated
downregulation of Prox1 in cultured lymphatic endothelial cells or
conditional downregulation of Prox1 during embryonic, postnatal, or
adult stages was sufficient to reprogram lymphatic endothelial cells
into blood endothelial cells.

Kazenwadel et al. (2010) identified a microRNA-181 (MIR181; see
612742)-binding sequence that was 100% conserved in the 3-prime ends of
human, mouse, rat, and chicken PROX1 transcripts. Mouse Mir181a bound
the 3-prime sequence of Prox1, inhibited its translation, and caused its
degradation. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemical analysis
showed reciprocal expression of Mir181a and Prox1 in embryonic mouse
lens and retina and in adult and embryonic blood and lymphatic
endothelial cells. Overexpression of Mir181a in embryonic lymphatic
endothelial cells caused degradation of Prox1 mRNA, reducing Prox1
protein expression and causing reprogramming of lymphatic endothelial
cells toward a blood vascular phenotype. Conversely, treatment of
primary embryonic blood vascular endothelial cells with an Mir181a
antagomir increased Prox1 mRNA levels. Kazenwadel et al. (2010)
concluded that MIR181A has a role in embryonic vascular development by
controlling PROX1 gene expression.

ANIMAL MODEL

The expression pattern of the Prox1 homeobox gene suggests that it has a
role in a variety of embryonic tissues, including lens. To analyze the
requirement for Prox1 during mammalian development, Wigle et al. (1999)
inactivated the locus in mice. Homozygous Prox1-null mice died at
midgestation from multiple developmental defects. Wigle et al. (1999)
described a specific effect on lens development. Prox1 inactivation
caused abnormal cellular proliferation, downregulated expression of the
cell cycle inhibitors Cdkn1b (600778) and Cdkn1c (600856), misexpression
of E-cadherin (192090), and inappropriate apoptosis. Consequently,
mutant lens cells failed to polarize and elongate properly, resulting in
a hollow lens. The data provided evidence that the progression of
terminal fiber differentiation and elongation is dependent on Prox1
activity during lens development.

Multiple organs cooperate to regulate appetite, metabolism, and glucose
and fatty acid homeostasis. Harvey et al. (2005) identified and
characterized lymphatic vasculature dysfunction as a cause of
adult-onset obesity. They found that functional inactivation of a single
allele of the homeobox gene Prox1 in mice led to adult-onset obesity due
to abnormal lymph leakage from mispatterned and ruptured lymphatic
vessels. They proposed that Prox1 heterozygous mice are a model for
adult-onset obesity and lymphatic vascular disease. They proposed that
there is crosstalk between the lymphatic vasculature and adipose tissue.
They proposed a model in which lymph linkage promotes adipose tissue
accumulation in 2 phases: first, increased storage of leaking lipids in
existing adipocytes causes adipocyte hypertrophy; and second, once the
adipocytes reach maximum lipid storage capacity, the promotion of
preadipocyte differentiation results in adipocyte hyperplasia in older
and more obese mice. Harvey et al. (2005) suggested that in the human,
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes associated with
lymphatic development could predispose individuals to adult-onset
obesity.

606443	TITLE *606443 cAMP RESPONSE ELEMENT-BINDING PROTEIN 3; CREB3
;;LUMAN;;
BASIC LEUCINE ZIPPER PROTEIN; LZIP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The herpes simplex virus (HSV) virion protein-16 (VP16) induces the
transcription of HSV immediate-early genes by its association with OCT1
(POU2F1; 164175). This association, however, is unstable and requires
the evolutionarily conserved host cell factor, HCFC1 (300019). The N and
C termini of HCFC1 interact with each other and with VP16. To elucidate
the normal function of HCFC1, Lu et al. (1997) used a yeast 2-hybrid
screen of a HeLa cell cDNA library with a fusion construct of the N and
C termini of HCFC1 as bait. They isolated a cDNA encoding CREB3, which
they designated Luman, after a legendary hero in ancient China. Sequence
analysis predicted that the 371-amino acid protein, which is 70% similar
to mouse Lzip, possesses an acidic N-terminal region followed by a
serine-rich region, a central bZIP domain with a 5-residue spacer
between the basic region and the leucine zipper, and a C-terminal
proline-rich region. Northern blot analysis revealed expression of a
1.4-kb CREB3 transcript in all adult and fetal tissues tested.
Functional analysis showed that CREB3 requires its N-terminal 38 amino
acids to be comparable to VP16 as a transcriptional activator. EMSA and
reporter analysis indicated that CREB3 binds to cyclic AMP response
elements. Binding and functional analysis indicated that VP16 and CREB3
bind to the same site on HCFC1. Lu et al. (1997) concluded that CREB3
may be a ubiquitous transcription factor.

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen with the N terminus of HCFC1 as bait,
Freiman and Herr (1997) cloned CREB3, which they referred to as LZIP.
They noted that the leucine zipper and bZIP domains of CREB3 are 93%
identical between human and mouse. Freiman and Herr (1997) proposed that
VP16, like CREB3, senses the transcriptional status of cells through its
interactions with HCFC1 and POU2F1.

Using the hepatitis C virus (HCV) core protein as bait in a yeast
2-hybrid screen of a liver cDNA library, followed by database searching,
Jin et al. (2000) obtained a cDNA encoding CREB3. Northern and Western
blot analyses confirmed the ubiquitous expression of CREB3. Functional
and mutation analyses identified a glutamic acid-rich transcription
activation domain in residues 109 to 163. Jin et al. (2000) determined
that the C terminus of HCV core interacts with the bZIP domain of CREB3
and can prevent the formation of nuclear CREB3 dimers.
Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated nuclear expression of CREB3;
expression shifted to the cytoplasm in the presence of HCV core protein.

GENE FUNCTION

Using immunofluorescence microscopy, Lu and Misra (2000) demonstrated
that CREB3 is retained in the cytoplasm of cultured cells and bovine
trigeminal ganglia, where it is colocalized with the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER)-associated protein calnexin (CANX; 114217). CREB3
expression was associated with a shift of HCFC1 from the nucleus to the
cytoplasm and, as also seen with the Zhangfei protein (606444), a lack
of permissiveness for HSV infection. CREB3 was able to activate HSV
genes critical for the reactivation of the virus. Lu and Misra (2000)
proposed that in the absence of nuclear HCFC1, HSV is unable to
replicate and becomes latent. Release of CREB3-HCFC1 and translocation
to the nucleus then activates HSV immediate-early gene expression and
reactivation.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the CREB3
gene to chromosome 9 (TMAP stSG1907).

610986	TITLE *610986 LEUCINE-RICH REPEAT KINASE 1; LRRK1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database analysis and RT-PCR of a mammary gland cDNA library, Korr et
al. (2006) cloned LRRK1. The deduced 2,014-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 225 kD. It has a domain organization
similar to that of LRRK2 (609007), with 6 N-terminal ankyrin repeats,
followed by 14 leucine-rich repeats, a RAS (see HRAS; 190020)-like
GTPase domain (ROC domain), a C-terminal to ROC (COR) domain, a
serine/threonine kinase domain, and 7 C-terminal WD40 repeats. Northern
blot analysis detected a 9.0-kb transcript in most tissues examined, and
RT-PCR showed ubiquitous expression. Highest expression of LRRK1 was in
testis, placenta, prostate, and muscle, with moderate expression in
brain, pancreas, small intestine, stomach, and spleen.
Fluorescence-tagged LRRK1 localized to the cytoplasm of transfected HeLa
cells.

By RT-PCR of human adult and fetal brain cDNA libraries, Taylor et al.
(2007) cloned LRRK1. PCR analysis revealed Lrrk1 expression in all mouse
brain regions examined, with highest expression in olfactory bulb.

GENE FUNCTION

Korr et al. (2006) found that LRRK1 underwent intramolecular, but not
intermolecular, autophosphorylation. Replacement of lys1269 with trp in
the ATP-binding niche of the kinase domain of LRRK1 significantly
reduced autophosphorylation activity. LRRK1 also functioned as a
GDP/GTP-binding protein, and its kinase activity was stimulated upon
binding of GTP to the ROC domain. Korr et al. (2006) generated mutations
in LRRK1 corresponding to Parkinson disease-8 (PARK8; 607060)-associated
mutations in LRRK2 and found that 3 of 4 significantly reduced LRRK1
kinase activity.

GENE STRUCTURE

Korr et al. (2006) determined that the LRRK1 gene contains 34 exons and
spans more than 150 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Korr et al. (2006) mapped the LRRK1 gene
to chromosome 15q26.3.

TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR GATA1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The GATA1 gene encodes a zinc finger DNA-binding transcription factor
that plays a critical role in the normal development of hematopoietic
cell lineages. The protein contains an N-terminal region that confers
transcriptional activity and a C-terminal domain that mediates binding
to DNA and other factors (summary by Calligaris et al., 1995).

CLONING

Vertebrate erythroid cells contain a tissue-specific transcription
factor referred to as ERYF1 (Evans et al., 1988), GF1 (Martin et al.,
1989), NFE1 (Wall et al., 1988), or GATA1 (Gumucio et al., 1991). At
least 4 other proteins--Sp1 (189906), Oct1 (164175), a CACCC-binding
protein, and a protein with an affinity for the -200 region--bind to the
gamma-globin promoter between nucleotides -260 and -137 (Gumucio et al.,
1991). Binding sites for these transcription factors are widely
distributed in the promoters and enhancers of the globin gene family and
of other erythroid-specific genes. Aberrant binding of the human factor
to a mutant site has been implicated in one type of hereditary
persistence of fetal hemoglobin (Martin et al., 1989). Trainor et al.
(1990) cloned the cDNA for the human ERYF1 gene. The central third of
the cDNA, containing 2 'finger' motifs, is almost identical to that of
chicken and mouse. The N- and C-terminal thirds of the human protein are
similar to those of mouse but are strikingly different from the
corresponding domains in the chicken. By means of a systematic
functional analysis of the human gamma-globin promoter to identify its
activator domains, Lin et al. (1992) identified the CACCC region and the
region containing the binding sites for protein GATA1 as activator
domains. GATA1 was the founding member of a family of DNA-binding
proteins that recognize the motif WGATAR (in which W is A or T, and R is
A or G) through a conserved multifunctional domain consisting of 2
C4-type zinc fingers.

Calligaris et al. (1995) identified 2 different GATA1 isoforms resulting
from alternative translation initiation sites in murine and human
erythroid cells. The GATA1 gene encodes a 1.8-kb mRNA yielding a
full-length 47-kD protein and a shorter 40-kD protein, termed GATA1s.
GATA1s uses a translation initiation site at codon 84, and thus lacks
the N-terminal transactivation domain. Both isoforms showed virtually
identical DNA-binding activity and could form homo- or heterodimers, but
the shorter GATA1s isoform was less active than the full-length protein
in transactivating a GATA-dependent reporter gene.

GENE FUNCTION

GATA1 and friend of GATA1 (FOG; ZFPM1; 601950) are each essential for
erythroid and megakaryocyte development. FOG, a zinc finger protein,
interacts with the amino (N) finger of GATA1 and cooperates with GATA1
to promote differentiation. To determine whether this interaction is
critical for GATA1 action, Crispino et al. (1999) selected GATA1 mutants
in yeast that failed to interact with FOG but retained normal DNA
binding, as well as a compensatory FOG mutant that restored interaction.
These GATA1 mutants did not promote erythroid differentiation of
GATA1-deficient erythroid cells. Differentiation was rescued by the
second-site FOG mutant. Thus, Crispino et al. (1999) concluded that
interaction of FOG with GATA1 is essential for the function of GATA1 in
erythroid differentiation.

De Maria et al. (1999) demonstrated that immature erythroid cells
express several death receptors whose ligands are produced by mature
erythroblasts. Exposure of erythroid progenitors to mature erythroblasts
or death-receptor ligands resulted in caspase-mediated degradation of
the transcription factor GATA1, which is associated with impaired
erythroblast development. Expression of a caspase-resistant GATA1
mutant, but not of the wildtype gene, completely restored erythroid
expansion and differentiation following the triggering of death
receptors, indicating that there is regulatory feedback between mature
and immature erythroblasts through caspase-mediated cleavage of GATA1.
Similarly, erythropoiesis blockade following erythropoietin (133170)
deprivation was largely prevented by the expression of
caspase-inhibitory proteins or caspase-resistant GATA1 in erythroid
progenitors. De Maria et al. (1999) concluded that caspase-mediated
cleavage of GATA1 may therefore represent an important negative control
mechanism in erythropoiesis.

Blobel et al. (1998) found that, in mouse nonhematopoietic cells, Cbp
(600140) stimulated Gata1 transcriptional activity. Cbp and Gata1 also
coimmunoprecipitated from nuclear extracts of mouse erythroid cells.
Interaction mapping pinpointed the contact sites to the zinc finger
region of Gata1 and to the E1A-binding region of Cbp. Expression of
adenovirus E1A revealed that the interaction of Cbp with Gata1 in
erythroid cells affected differentiation and expression of endogenous
Gata1 target genes.

Horak et al. (2002) demonstrated the usefulness of chromatin
immunoprecipitation (chIp) analysis for mapping GATA1 binding sites in
the beta-globin locus, and suggested a general utility of the method for
mapping transcription factor binding sites within the beta-globin locus
and throughout the genome. This approach involves chIp of protein-DNA
complexes and microarray hybridization of labeled, immunopurified DNA
(chip).

Stumpf et al. (2006) found that mouse progenitor cells deficient in the
Mediator complex component Med1 (PPARBP; 604311) had a defect in
production of erythroid burst-forming units and colony-forming units,
but not in forming myeloid colonies. Med1 interacted physically with
Gata1, and in transcription assays, Med1 deficiency led to a defect in
Gata1-mediated transactivation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays
showed Mediator complex components at Gata1-occupied enhancer sites.
Stumpf et al. (2006) concluded that MED1 acts as a pivotal coactivator
for GATA1 in erythroid development.

Ribeil et al. (2007) demonstrated that during erythroid differentiation
but not apoptosis, the chaperone protein Hsp70 (140550) protects GATA1
from caspase-mediated proteolysis. At the onset of caspase activation,
Hsp70 colocalizes and interacts with GATA1 in the nucleus of erythroid
precursors undergoing terminal differentiation. In contrast,
erythropoietin starvation induces the nuclear export of Hsp70 and the
cleavage of GATA1. In an in vitro assay, Hsp70 protected GATA1 from
caspase-3 (CASP3; 600636)-mediated proteolysis through its
peptide-binding domain. Ribeil et al. (2007) used RNA-mediated
interference to decrease the Hsp70 content of erythroid precursors
cultured in the presence of erythropoietin. This led to GATA1 cleavage,
a decrease in hemoglobin content, downregulation of the expression of
the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-XL (see 600039), and cell death by
apoptosis. These effects were abrogated by the transduction of a
caspase-resistant GATA1 mutant. Thus, Ribeil et al. (2007) concluded
that in erythroid precursors undergoing terminal differentiation, Hsp70
prevents active CASP3 from cleaving GATA1 and inducing apoptosis.

HSP27 (HSPB1; 602195) is a ubiquitin-binding protein involved in
proteasomal degradation of certain proteins under stress conditions. De
Thonel et al. (2010) found that HSP27 was involved in
proteasome-mediated degradation of GATA1. Knockdown of HSP27 or
overexpression of GATA1 inhibited differentiation of primary cultured
human erythroid cells and the K562 erythroleukemia cell line.
HSP27-mediated GATA1 degradation was reduced by proteasome inhibitors
and required prior acetylation of GATA1 and serine phosphorylation of
HSP27 via the p38 MAP kinase (MAPK14; 600289) pathway.

Yu et al. (2010) observed erythropoietic defects in fetal liver of Senp1
(612157) -/- mice. These defects were accompanied by reduced activity of
Gata1 and reduced expression of Gata1 target genes due to accumulation
of sumoylated Gata1. Mechanistic studies in human cells showed that
SENP1 directly desumoylated GATA1 and thereby regulated GATA1
DNA-binding activity, GATA1-dependent EPOR (133171) expression, and
erythropoiesis. They concluded that SENP1 promotes GATA1 activation and
subsequent erythropoiesis by desumoylating GATA1.

MAPPING

Zon et al. (1990) used cross-hybridization to the finger domain of
murine GF-1 to isolate cDNA encoding the human homolog. By hybridization
to panels of human-rodent DNAs, they assigned the human locus to
chromosome Xp21-p11. By a combination of in situ hybridization and
analysis of human-rodent hybrid cell lines, Caiulo et al. (1991)
demonstrated that the NFE1 gene is located in Xp11.23.

Chapman et al. (1991) identified a single X-chromosome locus in the
mouse, Gf-1, and by analysis of recombinants from 203 backcross progeny,
mapped the locus to the proximal part of the chromosome, coincident with
the Cybb locus and proximal to the Otc locus.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Germline GATA1 Mutations Causing Hematopoietic Disorders

In 2 half brothers, born of the same mother, with X-linked
thrombocytopenia with dyserythropoietic anemia (XLTDA; 300367), Nichols
et al. (2000) identified a germline hemizygous mutation in the GATA1
gene (V205M; 305371.0001). In vitro functional expression studies showed
that the V205M mutation abrogated the interaction between GATA1 and FOG1
(ZFPM1; 601950), inhibiting the ability of GATA1 to rescue erythroid
differentiation in an erythroid cell line deficient for GATA1. The
findings underscored the importance of the FOG1-GATA1 associations in
both megakaryocyte and erythroid development, and suggested that other
X-linked anemias or thrombocytopenias may be caused by defects in the
GATA1 gene. The GATA1 gene was chosen for study because targeted
mutagenesis in embryonic stem cells and mice revealed roles for the
Gata1 gene in erythrocyte and megakaryocyte differentiation (see ANIMAL
MODEL and Fujiwara et al., 1996; Shivdasani et al., 1997).

In a family with isolated X-linked thrombocytopenia without anemia but
with some dyserythropoietic features, Freson et al. (2001) identified an
asp218-to-gly mutation (305371.0002) in the GATA1 gene, which resulted
in a weaker interaction with FOG1.

Yu et al. (2002) identified an arg216-to-gln substitution in the GATA1 N
finger (305371.0006) as the cause of X-linked thrombocytopenia with
beta-thalassemia (314050). By analyzing mutant and wildtype GATA1
proteins expressed in transfected COS cells, they found that the
mutation did not affect interaction between GATA1 and a single
GATA-binding sequence. It did, however, reduce the affinity between
GATA1 and palindromic GATA sites. GATA1 carrying this mutation also
interacted normally with FOG1 and could direct differentiation in a
murine erythroblast cell line, although somewhat less efficiently than
the wildtype protein.

In 8 affected males in 2 generations of a family with X-linked anemia
with or without neutropenia and/or platelet abnormalities (XLANP;
300835), Hollanda et al. (2006) identified a germline splice site
mutation in the GATA1 gene (332G-C, V74L; 305371.0008) resulting in the
synthesis of only the short variant, GATA1s. The data suggested that
GATA1s alone, produced in low or normal levels, is not sufficient to
support normal erythropoiesis. Acquired somatic mutations in the GATA1
gene that result in synthesis of GATA1s have been found in individuals
with Down syndrome with both transient myeloproliferative disorder and
acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (see 190685). However, none of the
patients reported by Hollanda et al. (2006) developed leukemia.

- Somatic GATA1 Mutations

Children with Down syndrome (190685) have a 10- to 20-fold elevated risk
of developing leukemia, particularly acute megakaryoblastic leukemia
(AMKL). Some pediatric cases of AMKL are associated with the 1;22
translocation that results in a mutant fusion protein involving RBM15
(606077) on chromosome 1 and MKL1 (606079) on chromosome 22. Wechsler et
al. (2002) showed that leukemic cells from individuals with Down
syndrome-related AMKL had somatic mutations in the GATA1 gene (see,
e.g., 305371.0004). Each mutation resulted in the introduction of a
premature stop codon in the gene sequence that encodes the
amino-terminal activation domain. These mutations prevented synthesis of
full-length GATA1 and resulted in synthesis of the shorter alternatively
translated variant (GATA1s) that is initiated downstream. Wechsler et
al. (2002) showed that GATA1s, which lacks the N-terminal
transactivation domain but retains both zinc finger domains and the
whole C terminus, interacts with the FOG1 cofactor to the same extent as
does full-length GATA1, but has a reduced transactivation potential. The
findings suggested that loss of wildtype GATA1 constitutes 1 step in the
pathogenesis of AMKL in Down syndrome.

Look (2002) reviewed the mechanism by which GATA1 mutations might
interact with trisomy 21 to result in acute megakaryoblastic leukemia.
He pointed out that several lines of evidence indicated that at least 2
classes of mutations are needed to transform a normal hematopoietic stem
cell (HSC) into a clonal acute myeloid leukemia. One class imparts a
myeloproliferative or survival advantage, as illustrated by activating
mutations in FLT3 (136351), encoding a receptor tyrosine kinase, or the
increased dosage of genes in chromosome 21 in persons with Down
syndrome. To generate overt leukemia, a second class of genetic
alterations must produce lineage-specific blocks in differentiation. The
mutations responsible for this step have been demonstrated mainly in
genes encoding chimeric transcription factors produced by chromosomal
translocation. Pabst et al. (2001) identified mutations in the CEBPA
gene (116897) that are associated with acute myeloid leukemia, and, like
GATA1, produce lineage-specific blocks in differentiation. Both CEBP1
and GATA1 are transcription factors that play pivotal roles in myeloid
lineage commitment.

As many as 10% of infants with Down syndrome present with transient
myeloproliferative disorder (TMD) at or shortly after birth. TMD is
characterized by an abundance of blasts within peripheral blood and
liver, and undergoes spontaneous remission in a majority of cases. TMD
may be a precursor to AMKL, with an estimated 30% of TMD patients
developing AMKL within 3 years. Mutations in GATA1 are associated with
the AMKL of Down syndrome. To determine whether the acquisition of GATA1
mutations is a late event restricted to acute leukemia, Mundschau et al.
(2003) analyzed GATA1 in somatic DNA from blasts derived from TMD
patients. They found that GATA1 was mutated in the TMD blasts from every
infant examined. These results demonstrated that GATA1 is likely to play
a critical role in the etiology of TMD, and mutagenesis of GATA1
represents a very early event in myeloid leukemogenesis in Down
syndrome. Hitzler et al. (2003) likewise presented evidence that GATA1
mutations are an early event, and that AMKL arises from latent transient
leukemia clones following initial apparent remission. All 7 patients
reported by Mundschau et al. (2003) and almost all of the patients
studied by Hitzler et al. (2003) had deletions or insertions in the
GATA1 gene rather than nucleotide substitutions.

Somatic mutations in exon 2 of the transcription factor GATA1 have been
detected in essentially all cases of megakaryoblastic leukemia and
transient myeloproliferative disorder (Gurbuxani et al., 2004). Taub et
al. (2004) presented evidence of prenatal origin of GATA1 mutations by
study of fetal liver from cases of Down syndrome.

Ahmed et al. (2004) studied genomic DNA from 12 AMKL and 4 TMD cases
(including neonatal, prediagnosis samples in 4 of the 16), neonatal
blood spots from 21 Down syndrome children without clinically evident
TMD or AMKL, and 62 non-Down syndrome cord blood samples. GATA1
mutations were present in all TMD and AMKL cases and at birth in 3 of 4
children without known clinical TMD who later developed AMKL. GATA1
mutations were present at birth in 2 of 21 Down syndrome neonates who
had not yet developed AMKL at the ages of 26 and 31 months. GATA1
mutations were not detected in 62 non-Down syndrome cord blood samples.
In 4 AMKL patients, multiple independent GATA1 mutations were observed.
Ahmed et al. (2004) concluded that GATA1 mutations occur in utero in
most Down syndrome TMD and AMKL, that they may occur without clinical
signs of disease, and that multiple separate GATA1 mutant clones can
occur in an individual.

ANIMAL MODEL

To define the mechanisms governing the transcriptional regulation of
Gata1, McDevitt et al. (1997) replaced upstream sequences that included
a DNase I hypersensitive region with a neomycin-resistance cassette by
homologous recombination in mouse embryonic stem cells and generated
mice either harboring this mutation or lacking the selection cassette
altogether. Mice lacking the DNase I hypersensitive region and
expressing the neomycin-resistance cassette had marked impairment in the
rate or efficiency of erythroid cell maturation due to a modest 4- to
5-fold decrease in Gata1 expression. The phenotype of embryos was,
however, far less severe than that seen in Gata1 -/- embryos, which
invariably died by embryonic day 11 due to proerythroblast arrest and
apoptosis of primitive erythroid precursors. McDevitt et al. (1997)
argued that by producing a 'knockdown' mutation, they revealed a
concentration-dependent role of GATA1 in terminal erythroid cell
maturation.

Whyatt et al. (2000) demonstrated that overexpression of GATA1 in
erythroid cells inhibits their differentiation, leading to a lethal
anemia. Using chromosome-X inactivation of a Gata1 transgene and
chimeric animals, Whyatt et al. (2000) showed that this defect is
intrinsic to erythroid cells, but nevertheless cell-nonautonomous.
Usually, cell nonautonomy is thought to reflect aberrant gene function
in cells other than those that exhibit the phenotype. On the basis of
their data, Whyatt et al. (2000) proposed an alternative mechanism in
which a signal originating from wildtype erythroid cells restores normal
differentiation to cells overexpressing GATA1 in vivo. The existence of
such a signaling mechanism indicates that previous interpretations of
cell-nonautonomous defects may be erroneous in some cases and may in
fact assign gene function to incorrect cell types.

Lyons et al. (2002) demonstrated that a nonsense mutation in the Gata1
gene was responsible for the disorder in the 'bloodless' zebrafish. It
is characterized by a severe reduction in blood cell progenitors and few
or no blood cells at the onset of circulation. Study of the mutation
shed new light on Gata1 structure and function in vivo, demonstrated
that Gata1 plays an essential role in zebrafish hematopoiesis with
significant conservation of function between mammals and zebrafish, and
offered a tool for future studies of the hematopoietic pathway.

To assess functions of the association between Gata1 and Fog1 (601950)
during mouse development, Shimizu et al. (2004) generated a mutant Gata1
gene that contained a substitution of glycine-205 for valine (V205G),
which abrogated its association with Fog1. They examined whether the
transgenic expression of mutant Gata1 rescued Gata1 germline mutants
from embryonic lethality. In high expressor lines they observed that the
mutant GATA1 rescued Gata1-deficient mice from embryonic lethality at
the expected frequency, showing that excess mutant Gata1 can eliminate
the lethal anemia that is due to GATA1 deficiency. In contrast,
transgene expression comparable to the endogenous Gata1 level resulted
in a much lower frequency of rescue, indicating that the GATA1/FOG1
association is critical for normal embryonic hematopoiesis. Rescued mice
in these analyses exhibited thrombocytopenia and displayed dysregulated
proliferation and impaired cytoplasmic maturation of megakaryocytes.
Although anemia was not observed under steady-state conditions, stress
erythropoiesis was attenuated in the rescued mice. The findings revealed
an indispensable role for the association of GATA1 and FOG1 during
late-state megakaryopoiesis and provided a unique model for X-linked
thrombocytopenia with inherited GATA1 mutations.

Acquired mutations in GATA1 are found in megakaryoblasts from nearly all
individuals with Down syndrome with transient myeloproliferative
disorder (TMD) and the related acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL).
The mutations lead to production of a variant GATA1 protein (GATA1s)
that is truncated at its N terminus. To understand the biologic
properties of GATA1s and its relation to TMD and AMKL, Li et al. (2005)
used gene targeting to generate Gata1 alleles that express Gata1s in
mice. They showed that the dominant action of Gata1s leads to
hyperproliferation of a unique, previously unrecognized yolk sac and
fetal liver progenitor, which they proposed accounts for the transient
nature of TMD and the restriction of AMKL to infants. These observations
raised the possibility that target cells in other leukemias of infancy
and early childhood are distinct from those in adult leukemias, and
underscored the interplay between specific oncoproteins and potential
target cells.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
THROMBOCYTOPENIA, X-LINKED, WITH DYSERYTHROPOIETIC ANEMIA
GATA1, VAL205MET

In 2 half brothers, born of the same mother, with X-linked
thrombocytopenia with dyserythropoietic anemia (XLTDA; 300367), Nichols
et al. (2000) identified a germline hemizygous 613G-A transition in the
GATA1 gene, resulting in a val205-to-met (V205M) substitution in a
highly conserved residue in the N-terminal zinc finger that is essential
for direct association of GATA1 with its essential cofactor FOG1 (ZFPM1;
601950). The mutation was not found in 50 control females. In vitro
functional expression studies using mouse cDNA in COS cells showed a
reduced interaction between mutant Gata1 and Fog1. The mutant protein
was also impaired in its ability to promote erythroid differentiation in
vitro. Both pregnancies were complicated by severe fetal anemia
requiring in utero red blood cell transfusions. The boys were anemic and
severely thrombocytopenic from birth, and both eventually required a
bone marrow transplant. Examination prior to the transplant showed
abnormalities in the erythrocyte and platelet lineages. Peripheral blood
showed a paucity of platelets, and erythrocytes were abnormal in size
and shape (poikilocytosis and anisocytosis). Both boys also had
cryptorchidism. There were 3 asymptomatic female sibs. Their mother, who
was heterozygous for the mutation, had mild chronic thrombocytopenia.

.0002
THROMBOCYTOPENIA, X-LINKED, WITHOUT DYSERYTHROPOIETIC ANEMIA
GATA1, ASP218GLY

Freson et al. (2001) described a family with isolated X-linked
macrothrombocytopenia without anemia but with some dyserythropoietic
features (300367) in 13 males in 9 sibships of 3 generations connected
through carrier females. A novel mutation in the GATA1 gene, asp218 to
gly (D218G), resulted in a weaker interaction with FOG1 (601950).
Electron microscopy of the patients' platelets showed giant platelets
with cytoplasmic clusters consisting of smooth endoplasmic reticulum and
abnormal membrane complexes.

.0003
THROMBOCYTOPENIA, X-LINKED, WITHOUT DYSERYTHROPOIETIC ANEMIA
GATA1, GLY208SER

Mehaffey et al. (2001) described a family in which 4 males in 2
generations related through female carriers had thrombocytopenia
characterized by macrothrombocytopenia, profound bleeding, and mild
dyserythropoiesis with no measurable anemia (300367). By sequencing the
entire coding region of GATA1, they identified a GG-to-TC change at
nucleotides 622-623 that resulted in a gly208-to-ser (G208S)
substitution within a highly conserved portion of the N-terminal zinc
finger domain. Although not required for DNA binding, the gly208 allele
of GATA1 is involved in direct interaction with FOG1 (601950), a
cofactor required for normal megakaryocytic and erythroid development.

.0004
LEUKEMIA, MEGAKARYOBLASTIC, OF DOWN SYNDROME, SOMATIC
GATA1, 4-BP INS

In leukemic cells from children with Down syndrome and acute
megakaryoblastic leukemia (190685), Wechsler et al. (2002) found a
somatic 4-bp insertion in exon 2 of the GATA1 gene.

.0005
THROMBOCYTOPENIA, X-LINKED, WITH DYSERYTHROPOIETIC ANEMIA
GATA1, ASP218TYR

Freson et al. (2002) described a 2-generation family with X-linked
thrombocytopenia and anemia (300367) in which affected individuals had a
652G-T transversion in the GATA1 gene, resulting in an asp218-to-tyr
(D218Y) substitution. Zinc finger interaction studies revealed a
stronger loss of affinity of D218Y-GATA1 than of D218G-GATA1
(305371.0002) for the essential transcription factor FOG1 (601950) and a
disturbed GATA1 self-association. Comparison of the phenotypic
characteristics of patients from both families revealed that platelet
and erythrocyte morphology as well as expression levels of the platelet
GATA1-target gene products were more profoundly disturbed for the
hemizygote D218Y mutation. The D218Y allele (as opposed to the D218G
allele) was not expressed in the platelets of a female carrier, while
her leukocytes showed a skewed X-inactivation pattern. The authors
concluded that the nature of the amino acid substitution at position 218
of the N-terminal zinc finger of GATA1 may be of crucial importance in
determining the severity of the phenotype in X-linked
macrothrombocytopenia patients and possibly also in inducing skewed X
inactivation.

.0006
THROMBOCYTOPENIA WITH BETA-THALASSEMIA, X-LINKED
GATA1, ARG216GLN

Yu et al. (2002) identified an arg216-to-gln (R216Q) mutation in the N
finger of GATA1 in a family with X-linked thrombocytopenia with
beta-thalassemia (XLTT; 314050). The family had previously been reported
by Thompson et al. (1977).

Tubman et al. (2007) identified an R216Q substitution in affected
members of a family with a mild bleeding disorder, thrombocytopenia, and
large agranular platelets characteristic of the so-called 'gray platelet
syndrome' (139090). In a letter, Balduini et al. (2007) stated that the
family reported by Tubman et al. (2007) had a phenotype consistent with
X-linked thrombocytopenia with beta-thalassemia (XLTT) and that the
classification as 'X-linked gray platelet syndrome' is a misnomer
risking confusion in the literature. They noted that deficiency of
platelet alpha-granules can be a feature of XLTT. In response, the
original authors (Neufeld et al., 2007) agreed that the disorder in the
family may be classified as an example of a unique disorder, i.e., XLTT,
but endorsed its classification as 'a unique kind of GPS, inherited in
X-linked fashion, with platelets indistinguishable by experts from
autosomal GPS (at the light microscope and ultrastructure level).'

.0007
LEUKEMIA, MEGAKARYOBLASTIC, SOMATIC
GATA1, 20-BP DUP

In leukemic cells derived from a 48-year-old woman with acute
megakaryoblastic leukemia, Harigae et al. (2004) identified a 20-bp
duplication in exon 2 of the GATA1 gene, resulting in the introduction
of a premature stop codon in the gene sequence encoding the N-terminal
activation domain. This was the first report of a GATA1 mutation in AMKL
cells from a patient who did not have Down syndrome (190685) or acquired
trisomy 21.

.0008
ANEMIA, X-LINKED, WITH OR WITHOUT NEUTROPENIA AND/OR PLATELET ABNORMALITIES
GATA1, 332G-C

Hollanda et al. (2006) described a Brazilian family in which 8 males in
2 generations had X-linked anemia with or without neutropenia and/or
platelet abnormalities (XLANP; 300835). Affected members had a 332G-C
transversion at the boundary of exon 2 of the GATA1 gene, predicted to
result in a val74-to-leu (V74L) substitution (Sankaran et al., 2012).
The mutation led to splice site changes that prevented the translation
of the full-length GATA1 protein and allowed the generation of only
GATA1s in the affected males. Unaffected carrier females were
heterozygous for this mutation. In the majority of affected individuals,
Hollanda et al. (2006) observed abnormal morphology of erythrocytes and
granulocytes in peripheral blood films as well as bone marrow with
trilineage dysplasia and hypocellularity of erythroid and granulocytic
lineages, and with normal or increased numbers of micromegakaryocytes.
Neutropenia of a variable degree was present in the affected
individuals. Data from the family strongly suggested that GATA1s is not
sufficient to support normal hematopoiesis in adults, in contrast to the
animal model findings of Li et al. (2005).

In 2 brothers with congenital anemia, occasional reductions in
neutrophil count, increased fetal hemoglobin, and low platelet count in
1 patient, Sankaran et al. (2012) identified a 332G-C transversion in
the last nucleotide of the exon 2 donor splice site of the GATA1 gene.
The transversion, which was identified by whole-exome sequencing, was
also predicted to result in a V74L substitution. RT-PCR studies of
patient samples showed that most of the GATA1 mRNA was for GATA1s,
although there were trace amounts of the full-length protein. Their
unaffected mother, who also carried the mutation, had about 53% levels
of the full-length protein. Both patients showed a favorable response to
corticosteroid therapy. Neither showed increased bleeding or an
increased propensity for infection. Bone marrow biopsy showed erythroid
hypoplasia without abnormalities of the other hematopoietic lineages,
and the boys were given a diagnosis of Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA;
105650); however, erythrocyte adenosine deaminase in the boys was not
elevated, as is usually observed in Diamond-Blackfan anemia.

ANEMIA, X-LINKED, WITH OR WITHOUT NEUTROPENIA AND/OR PLATELET ABNORMALITIES
GATA1, 1-BP DEL, 332G

In a 3.5-year-old boy with X-linked anemia that responded to
corticosteroid treatment (300835), Sankaran et al. (2012) identified a
1-bp deletion (332delG) in exon 2 of the GATA1 gene at the same
nucleotide involved in 305371.0008. The 1-bp deletion was predicted to
favor production of GATA1s as a result of impaired splicing and
frameshift of the full-length open reading frame. The patient, who
presented at age 6 weeks, did not have other hematologic abnormalities,
but fetal hemoglobin was increased. Erythrocyte adenosine deaminase was
not elevated. This boy was 1 of 62 male probands with a clinical
diagnosis of Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA; 105650) without known
mutations who was studied for GATA1 mutations.

THROMBOCYTOPENIA WITH BETA-THALASSEMIA, X-LINKED
GATA1, ARG216TRP

In a 3-year-old boy with X-linked thrombocytopenia with beta-thalassemia
(314050) and anemia, Phillips et al. (2007) identified a hemizygous
mutation in the GATA1 gene, resulting in an arg216-to-trp (R216W)
substitution in a highly conserved residue in the N-terminal zinc
finger. The patient presented with a photosensitive bullous dermatosis
and was found to have hirsutism, splenomegaly, and increased
uroporphyrin with decreased UROS (606938) activity (21% of normal),
consistent with a clinical diagnosis of congenital erythropoietic
porphyria (CEP; 263700). However, sequencing of the UROS gene was
negative. Laboratory studies showed microcytic anemia with increased
reticulocytes, thrombocytopenia, increased fetal hemoglobin (59.5%), and
beta-thalassemia. Bone marrow biopsy was hypercellular with
dyserythropoiesis, nuclear bridging, and occasional multinucleated red
cells. Megakaryocytes were decreased in number. He underwent a stem cell
transplant, which was successful. The patient's mother and maternal
grandmother carried the mutation in heterozygous state. The mother had
had multiple first-trimester spontaneous abortions, but no signs of
porphyria. The grandmother had chronic anemia and thrombocytopenia. The
GATA1 gene regulates expression of UROS in developing erythrocytes,
which explained the decreased UROS activity and features of porphyria.
The R216W mutation affects the same residue as that reported by Yu et
al. (2002) (R216Q; 305371.0006) in a family with X-linked
thrombocytopenia with beta-thalassemia, but a slightly different
phenotype: the anemia was less severe and fetal hemoglobin levels were
not as elevated. Phillips et al. (2007) postulated that the larger, more
hydrophobic tryptophan in their family would affect GATA1 binding to the
UROS promoter more significantly than the smaller glutamine described by
Yu et al. (2002). The striking fetal hemoglobin in the patient reported
by Phillips et al. (2007) also suggested a role for GATA1 in globin
chain switching.

613208	TITLE *613208 XPC GENE; XPC
;;XPCC GENE;;
RAD4, YEAST, HOMOLOG OF; RAD4
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The XPC gene encodes a protein that functions as a damage detector
involved in the first step of global genome nucleotide excision DNA
repair (Sugasawa et al. (1998); Volker et al., 2001).

CLONING

Teitz et al. (1987) were able to correct UV sensitivity in a xeroderma
pigmentosum group C (XPC; 278720) cell line by transfection with a human
cDNA library derived from fibroblasts. UV resistance appeared to be
closely linked to resistance to G418, an antibiotic. The authors
suggested the gene symbol XPCC (for xeroderma pigmentosum group
C-complementing).

Peterson and Legerski (1991) devised a simple, highly efficient cDNA
expression system for use in human cells. Legerski and Peterson (1992)
used this system to isolate a cDNA clone that restored the ultraviolet
sensitivity and unscheduled DNA synthesis of XPC cells to normal levels.
The cloned XPC gene was found to encode a highly hydrophilic protein
composed of a predicted 823 amino acids and sharing limited homology
with the product of the yeast DNA repair gene RAD4. The XPC transcript
was undetectable by Northern blotting in most XPC cell lines examined.

MAPPING

Legerski et al. (1994) mapped the XPC gene to chromosome 3p25 by somatic
cell hybridization. Although it is closely linked to the RAD23B gene
(600062) in the human, the mouse homolog of RAD23B maps to chromosome 4
and the mouse homolog of XPC maps to chromosome 6 (van der Spek et al.,
1996). The physical disconnection of the genes in the mouse argues
against a functional significance of the colocalization of these genes
in the human.

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, van der Spek et al. (1994) showed
that the XPC and HHR23B (600062) genes, the products of which form a
tight complex, colocalize to chromosome 3p25.1. Pulsed-field gel
electrophoresis revealed that the 2 genes may share a MluI restriction
fragment of about 625 kb.

GENE FUNCTION

Masutani et al. (1994) reported the purification to homogeneity and
subsequent cDNA cloning of a repair complex by in vitro complementation
of the XPC defect in a cell-free repair system containing UV-damaged
SV40 minichromosomes. The complex had a high affinity for
single-stranded DNA and consisted of 2 tightly associated proteins of
125 and 58 kD. The 125-kD subunit was an N-terminally extended version
of the XPC gene product, which is thought to represent the human homolog
of the RAD4 nucleotide excision repair (NER) gene of Saccharomyces
cerevisiae. The 58-kD species turned out to be a human homolog of yeast
RAD23. Unexpectedly, a second human counterpart of RAD23 was identified.
Masutani et al. (1994) referred to the 2 as HHR23A (600061) and HHR23B
(600062). The 2 RAD23 homologs were expressed in the same cells.
However, only the HHR23B protein was found in a complex with p125/XPC.
Masutani et al. (1994) pointed out that no human mutant defective in
HHR23A had been identified.

The XPC-HHR23B complex is specifically involved in global genome but not
transcription-coupled NER. Using a DNA damage recognition-competition
assay, Sugasawa et al. (1998) identified XPC-HHR23B as the earliest
damage detector to initiate NER; it acts before the known damage-binding
protein XPA (611153). Coimmunoprecipitation and DNase I footprinting
showed that XPC-HHR23B binds to a variety of NER lesions. This provides
a plausible explanation for the extreme damage specificity exhibited by
global genome repair.

Volker et al. (2001) described the assembly of the NER complex in normal
and repair-deficient (xeroderma pigmentosum) human cells by employing a
novel technique of local ultraviolet irradiation combined with
fluorescent antibody labeling. The damage-recognition complex XPC-HR23B
appeared to be essential for the recruitment of all subsequent NER
factors in the preincision complex, including transcription repair
factor TFIIH (see 189972). Volker et al. (2001) found that XPA
associates relatively late, is required for anchoring of ERCC1
(126380)-XPF (133520), and may be essential for activation of the
endonuclease activity of XPG (133530). These findings identified XPC as
the earliest known NER factor in the reaction mechanism, gave insight
into the order of subsequent NER components, provided evidence for a
dual role of XPA, and supported a concept of sequential assembly of
repair proteins at the site of damage rather than a preassembled
repairosome.

Shimizu et al. (2003) presented evidence that human and mouse XPC-HR23B
complexes interact with thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG; 601423), which
initiates base excision repair of G/T mismatches. XPC-HR23B stimulated
TDG activity by promoting the release of TDG following the excision of
mismatched T bases. In the presence of apurinic/apyrimidinic
endonuclease (APEX; 107748), XPC-HR23B had an additive effect on TDG
turnover without significantly inhibiting the subsequent action of APEX.
Shimizu et al. (2003) concluded that the XPC-HR23B complex contributes
to the suppression of spontaneous mutations and that compromised
function in XPC patients may promote carcinogenesis.

In studies of the contribution of the XPC gene to DNA repair, Emmert et
al. (2000) found that the gene leads to selective repair of cyclobutane
pyrimidine dimers (CPD) rather than 6-4 photoproducts (6-4PP).
Increasing XPC gene expression in vivo led to selective repair of CPD in
the global genome. Undetectable XPC protein was associated with no
repair of CPD or 6-4PP, detectable but subnormal XPC protein levels
reconstituted CPD but not 6-4PP repair, and normal XPC protein levels
fully reconstituted both CPD and 6-4PP repair.

Using sequence profile analysis, Anantharaman et al. (2001) showed that
RAD4/XPC proteins contain the ancient transglutaminase fold and are
specifically related to the peptide-N-glycanases (PNGases) which remove
glycans from glycoproteins during their degradation (Suzuki et al.,
2000). The PNGases retain the catalytic triad that is typical of this
fold and are predicted to have a reaction mechanism similar to that
involved in transglutamination. In contrast, the RAD4/XPC proteins are
predicted to be inactive and are likely to possess only the protein
interaction function in DNA repair. These proteins also contain a long,
low-complexity insert in the globular transglutaminase domain.
Anantharaman et al. (2001) hypothesized that the RAD4/XPC proteins,
along with other inactive transglutaminase-fold proteins, represent a
case of functional reassignment of an ancient domain following the loss
of the ancestral enzymatic activity.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Min and Pavletich (2007) presented the crystal structure of the yeast
XPC ortholog Rad4 bound to DNA containing a cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer
(CPD) lesion. The structure showed that Rad4 inserts a beta-hairpin
through the DNA duplex, causing the 2 damaged basepairs to flip out of
the double helix. The expelled nucleotides of the undamaged strand are
recognized by Rad4, whereas the 2 CPD-linked nucleotides become
disordered. Min and Pavletich (2007) concluded that the lesions
recognized by Rad4/XPC thermodynamically destablize the Watson-Crick
double helix in a manner that facilitates the flipping out of 2
basepairs.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Li et al. (1993) identified changes in the XPC gene (see, e.g.,
613208.0001-613208.0004) in 5 XPC cell lines. In 4 of them, Northern
blot analysis of RNAs demonstrated subnormal levels of the XPC
transcript, whereas the fifth exhibited a near normal level. Four of the
5 mutations resulted in a truncated protein, and there was a correlation
between the degree to which the protein was truncated and the repair
defect at the cellular level.

In affected members of 2 unrelated but consanguineous Turkish families
with XPC, Khan et al. (2004) identified 2 different splice site
mutations in the XPC gene (613208.0008 and 613208.0009), respectively.
RT-PCR of cells from the severely affected patients showed a short mRNA
band and no detectable wildtype band. In contrast, cells from the more
mildly affected patients had an mRNA band of shorter size and 1 of
normal size.

Cleaver et al. (1999) reviewed mutations in the XPC gene.

In affected members of 14 Tunisian families with XPC, Ben Rekaya et al.
(2009) identified the same homozygous 2-bp deletion (1744delTG;
613208.0010) in the XPC gene. Haplotype analysis indicated a founder
effect.

ANIMAL MODEL

Sands et al. (1995) generated XPC-deficient mice by 'knockout' of the
mouse homolog of the human XPC gene using embryonic stem cell
technology. Mice homozygous for mutant alleles were viable and did not
exhibit an increased susceptibility to spontaneous tumor generation at 1
year of age. However, they were found to be highly susceptible to
ultraviolet-induced carcinogenesis compared to mice heterozygous for the
mutant allele and to wildtype controls. Homozygous mutant mice also
displayed a spectrum of ultraviolet exposure-related pathologic skin and
eye changes consistent with those found in the human disease xeroderma
pigmentosum group C. The deficient mice showed marked hyperplasia of the
epidermis with focal areas of hyperkeratosis in varying degrees of
dysplasia, acantholysis, and/or dyskeratosis, similar to the human
lesions known as actinic or solar keratosis. Changes in the eye included
severe keratitis and corneal ulceration.

Cheo et al. (1999) studied the XPC -/- mouse to determine whether there
is a predisposition to cancers in noncutaneous tissues associated with
exposure to environmental carcinogens. They observed a significantly
higher incidence of chemically-induced liver and lung tumors in these
mice, compared with normal and heterozygous littermates, using
2-acetylaminofluorene and NOH-2-acetylaminofluorene. In addition, the
progression of liver tumors in the mice homozygous mutant for XPC and
heterozygous mutant for p53 was accelerated, compared with the
homozygous mutant XPC mice and homozygous wildtype p53 animals. They
also demonstrated a higher incidence of spontaneous testicular tumors in
XPC -/- p53 -/- double mutant mice, compared with mice homozygous for
mutation only at the p53 locus.

Hollander et al. (2005) found that 100% of Xpc -/- mice developed
multiple spontaneous lung tumors with a minority progressing to nonsmall
cell lung adenocarcinoma, occasionally with metastasis to adjacent lymph
nodes.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
XERODERMA PIGMENTOSUM, COMPLEMENTATION GROUP C
XPC, PRO218HIS

In XPC (278720) cell line XP1MI, Li et al. (1993) identified a mutation
in the XPC gene, resulting in a pro218-to-his (P218H) substitution. The
finding suggested that the cell line was either homozygous or hemizygous
for this mutation. The XP1MI cell line was the most UV-sensitive of 5
cell lines analyzed by Li et al. (1993). Furthermore, the patient
demonstrated XP-associated neurologic abnormalities, a rarity in group
C.

.0002
XERODERMA PIGMENTOSUM, COMPLEMENTATION GROUP C
XPC, 83-BP INS, NT462

In XPC (278720) cell line XP3BE-L3, Li et al. (1993) identified an 83-bp
insertion beginning at position 462 in the XPC cDNA, predicted to result
in premature termination.

.0003
XERODERMA PIGMENTOSUM, COMPLEMENTATION GROUP C
XPC, 3-BP INS, GGT, CODON 580 AND LYS822GLN

In XPC (278720) cell line XP8BE-L1, Li et al. (1993) identified 2
mutations in the XPC gene: 1 was a 3-bp insertion (GGT) that resulted in
the insertion of a valine residue after val580, and the other was a
point mutation that created a nonconservative amino acid change near the
carboxyl terminus of the protein (lys822-to-gln; K822Q). The mutation
was either homo- or hemizygous. It could not be determined whether only
1 or both of these mutations was responsible for the observed repair
deficiency. Of the 5 cell lines examined, XP8BE-L1 was the least
sensitive to UV irradiation and exhibited a near-normal level of XPC
mRNA. Clinically, the patient XP8BE was diagnosed with XP at birth and
was rigorously protected from sunlight from that time; as of 13 years of
age, the patient had not exhibited any malignant neoplasms. However, an
older brother with XP began to develop tumors by age 13. Like the vast
majority of XPC patients, this patient did not exhibit neurologic
complications.

.0004
XERODERMA PIGMENTOSUM, COMPLEMENTATION GROUP C
XPC, 2-BP DEL, 1132AA

In XPC (278720) cell line XP1BE-L1, Li et al. (1993) identified a 2-bp
deletion (1132delA) in the XPC gene, predicted to result in premature
termination of the protein by a new stop codon 15 nucleotides
downstream. The deletion appeared to be either homozygous or hemizygous.

.0005
XERODERMA PIGMENTOSUM, COMPLEMENTATION GROUP C
XPC, IVS9DS, T-G, +2

In a 4-year-old boy of Korean ancestry who had xeroderma pigmentosum
type C (278720) characterized by sun sensitivity and multiple cutaneous
neoplasms, Khan et al. (1998) found a T-to-G transversion at the splice
donor site of exon 9 of the XPC gene. The patient had some unusual
neurologic features, including the inability to speak, hyperactivity,
and autistic features. There was a markedly decreased level of XPC mRNA,
and the splice site mutation was found to generate 3 different isoforms:
1 with loss of exon 9, resulting in premature termination; another with
an insertion of exons 9a and 9b; and a third with a deletion of exon 9
and insertion of exon 9a. The exon 9a insertion was located in intron 9
and was flanked by strong splice donor and acceptor sequences. Analysis
of the patient's blood showed persistently low levels of glycine (68
microM; normal = 125-318 microM). Normal glycine levels were maintained
with oral glycine supplements, and the patient's hyperactivity
diminished.

.0006
XERODERMA PIGMENTOSUM, COMPLEMENTATION GROUP C
XPC, 2-BP DEL, 669AT

In 2 Israeli sibs with severe xeroderma pigmentosum type C (278720),
Slor et al. (2000) identified a homozygous 2-bp deletion (669delAT) in
exon 5 of the XPC gene predicted to result in a truncated protein.
Cultured skin fibroblasts from both patients showed reductions in
postultraviolet survival (11% of normal), unscheduled DNA synthesis (10%
of normal), global genome DNA repair (15% of normal), and plasmid host
cell reactivation (5% of normal). Transcription-coupled DNA repair was
normal, however. Northern blot analysis revealed greatly reduced
xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group C mRNA. Sun protection
delayed the onset of skin cancer and prolonged life in the second sib.

.0007
XERODERMA PIGMENTOSUM, COMPLEMENTATION GROUP C
XPC, ARG579TER

In 2 severely affected Turkish sibs with XPC (278720), a boy with
multiple skin cancers who died at age 10 (XP67TMA) and an 8-year-old
girl who began developing skin cancer before 3 years of age (XP68TMA),
Gozukara et al. (2001) identified a 1840C-T transition in exon 8 of the
XPC gene, resulting in an arg579-to-ter (R579X) substitution. This
change would lead to a truncation of the XPC protein at amino acid 579
rather than at its full length of 940 amino acids. Restriction fragment
length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of XPC exon 8 DNA showed that both
affected children were homozygous and both parents were heterozygous for
the mutation, consistent with a history of consanguinity in the family.
This mutation was reported by Chavanne et al. (2000) in an Italian
patient (XP10PV) from Bologna who developed skin cancers beginning at
age 4 years. She had ocular lesions including tumors and died at age 15
years. The parents were not known to be consanguineous. Gozukara et al.
(2001) studied 19 microsatellite markers flanking the XPC gene on
chromosome 3; their results suggested that the XPC allele passed between
Italy and Turkey approximately 300 to 500 years ago. The R579X XPC
allele is thus associated with severe clinical disease with multiple
skin cancers and early death.

.0008
XERODERMA PIGMENTOSUM, COMPLEMENTATION GROUP C
XPC, IVS3AS, T-A, -9

In 2 sibs with xeroderma pigmentosum type C (278720) and multiple skin
cancers from a consanguineous Turkish family, Khan et al. (2004)
identified homozygosity for a -9T-A transversion in intron 3 of the XPC
gene. The mutation was located in a splice lariat branchpoint sequence.
PCR analysis of fibroblast cells detected an XPC mRNA isoform with
deletion of exon 4 that had no DNA repair activity in a post-UV host
cell reactivation assay. The 20-year-old male and his 16-year-old sister
were severely affected. They developed skin lesions at 3 years of age.
Both had cutaneous atrophy, telangiectasia, actinic keratoses, and
multiple skin cancers including squamous cell carcinomas, basal cell
carcinomas, and melanomas.

.0009
XERODERMA PIGMENTOSUM, COMPLEMENTATION GROUP C
XPC, IVS3AS, A-G, -24

In 3 sibs with mild xeroderma pigmentosum C (278720) from a
consanguineous Turkish family, Khan et al. (2004) identified
homozygosity for a -24A-G transition in intron 3 of the XPC gene. Cells
from the affected sibs produced 3 to 5% normal XPC message and had a
higher level of post-UV host cell reactivation than cells from the
severely affected sibs harboring the -9T-A mutation (613208.0008). The
authors concluded that a small amount of normal XPC mRNA can provide
partial protection against skin cancers. The 3 sisters, aged 20, 18, and
11 years, were mildly affected. Skin lesions began at age 3 to 5 years.
They had freckling but no skin atrophy, telangiectasia, or actinic
keratoses. The oldest sister had a squamous cell carcinoma excised from
her face at age 12 years. The other sisters did not have skin cancer.

XERODERMA PIGMENTOSUM, COMPLEMENTATION GROUP C
XPC, 2-BP DEL, 1744TG

In affected members of 14 Tunisian families with severe XPC (278720),
Ben Rekaya et al. (2009) identified a homozygous 2-bp deletion
(1744delTG) in exon 9 of the XPC gene, resulting in a frameshift and
premature termination (fsTer572). Clinical features included photophobia
and skin tumors, including basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell
carcinoma, and malignant melanoma. None of the patients had neurologic
abnormalities. Haplotype analysis indicated a founder effect.

115440	TITLE *115440 CASEIN KINASE II, ALPHA-1; CSNK2A1
;;CASEIN KINASE II, ALPHA SUBUNIT; CK2A1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Casein kinase II is a serine/threonine kinase that phosphorylates acidic
protein such as casein. It has a tetrameric a(2)/b(2) structure. The
alpha subunit of molecular mass 40 kD possesses catalytic activity,
whereas the beta subunit (115441), molecular mass 25 kD, is
autophosphorylated in vitro. Meisner et al. (1989) reported the
identification and nucleotide sequencing of a complete human cDNA for
the alpha subunit. Using the full-length cDNA probe, Meisner et al.
(1989) found 2 bands with restriction enzymes that have no recognition
sites within the cDNA and 3 to 6 bands with enzymes having single
internal sites. These results were considered consistent with the
existence of 2 genes encoding alpha subunits. See 115442.

GENE STRUCTURE

Wirkner et al. (1994) demonstrated that the CSNK2A1 gene contains 8
exons whose sequences comprise bases 102 to 824 of the coding region of
the human casein kinase II alpha subunit. Three of the 9 introns are
located at positions corresponding to those of the homologous gene in
the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. The introns contain 8 complete and
8 incomplete Alu repeats.

GENE FUNCTION

Phosphorylation of the human p53 protein (191170) at ser392 is
responsive to ultraviolet (UV) but not gamma irradiation. Keller et al.
(2001) identified and purified a mammalian UV-activated protein kinase
complex that phosphorylates ser392 in vitro. This kinase complex
contains CK2 and the chromatin transcriptional elongation factor FACT, a
heterodimer of SPT16 (605012) and SSRP1 (604328). In vitro studies
showed that FACT alters the specificity of CK2 in the complex such that
it selectively phosphorylates p53 over other substrates, including
casein. In addition, phosphorylation by the kinase complex was found to
enhance p53 activity. These results provided a potential mechanism for
p53 activation by UV irradiation.

Doray et al. (2002) demonstrated that the Golgi-localized,
gamma-ear-containing adenosine diphosphate ribosylation factor-binding
proteins (GGA1, 606004 and GGA3, 606006) and the coat protein adaptor
protein-1 (AP-1) complex (see AP1G2, 603534) colocalize in
clathrin-coated buds of the trans-Golgi networks of mouse L cells and
human HeLa cells. Binding studies revealed a direct interaction between
the hinge domains of the GGAs and the gamma-ear domain of AP-1. Further,
AP-1 contained bound casein kinase-2 that phosphorylated GGA1 and GGA3,
thereby causing autoinhibition. Doray et al. (2002) demonstrated that
this autoinhibition could induce the directed transfer of mannose
6-phosphate receptors (see 154540) from the GGAs to AP-1. Mannose
6-phosphate receptors that were defective in binding to GGAs were poorly
incorporated into adaptor protein complex containing clathrin coated
vesicles. Thus, Doray et al. (2002) concluded that GGAs and the AP-1
complex interact to package mannose 6-phosphate receptors into
AP-1-containing coated vesicles.

Lin et al. (2002) identified a Drosophila circadian mutant, Timekeeper
(Tik), that behaved in a dominant manner. Tik homozygotes do not live to
adulthood, and heterozygotes have a circadian rhythm lengthened by about
3 hours. Lin et al. (2002) showed that the catalytic subunit of
Drosophila casein kinase-2 (CK2-alpha) is expressed predominantly in the
cytoplasm of key circadian pacemaker neurons. CK2-alpha mutant flies
showed lengthened circadian period, decreased CK2 activity, and delayed
nuclear entry of Per (see 602260). Lin et al. (2002) suggested that
these are probably direct, as CK2-alpha specifically phosphorylates Per
in vitro. Lin et al. (2002) proposed that CK2 is an evolutionary link
between the divergent circadian systems of animals, plants, and fungi.

Loizou et al. (2004) showed that CK2 phosphorylates the scaffold protein
XRCC1 (194360) and thereby enables the assembly and activity of DNA
single-strand break repair protein complexes in vitro and at sites of
chromosome breakage. Inhibition of XRCC1 phosphorylation by mutation of
the CK2 phosphorylation sites or by preventing CK2 activity using a
highly specific inhibitor ablated the rapid repair of cellular DNA
single-strand breaks by XRCC1. These data identified a direct role for
CK2 in the repair of chromosome DNA strand breaks and in maintaining
genetic integrity.

Downstream core promoter elements (DPE) are regulatory sequences that
add diversity to the promoter architecture of RNA polymerase
II-transcribed genes. Despite a functional correlation between the
presence of TFIID (313650) and DPE, Lewis et al. (2005) found that TFIID
was insufficient for DPE-specific transcription in HeLa cells. Using a
functional transcription assay coupled with conventional biochemistry,
they found that protein kinase CK2, in conjunction with the coactivator
PC4 (600503), established DPE-specific transcription.

MAPPING

By segregation analysis of rodent-human somatic cell hybrids and
chromosomal in situ hybridization, Yang-Feng et al. (1991) identified 2
loci for the alpha subunit of casein kinase II: 11p15.5-p.15.4 and
20p13. Whether one of these is a pseudogene remained to be determined.
Boldyreff et al. (1992) likewise found 2 assignments by in situ
hybridization: 11pter-p15.1 and 20p13. Only the locus on chromosome 11
was confirmed by somatic cell hybrid analysis, based on the presence of
a CK2A1-specific 20-kb fragment. However, Wirkner et al. (1992)
demonstrated that the sequence that maps to 11p15 by in situ
hybridization has the characteristics of a processed pseudogene.

By fluorescence in situ hybridization using an 18.9-kb genomic clone
representing the central portion of the gene, Wirkner et al. (1994)
mapped CSNK2A1 to 20p13. Using the genomic clone, no hybridization
signal was obtained in 11p15 as had previously been the case when the
cDNA was used as probe (Yang-Feng et al., 1991).

608291	TITLE *608291 TUBULIN-TYROSINE LIGASE; TTL
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TTL is a cytosolic enzyme involved in the posttranslational modification
of alpha-tubulin (see 602529). Alpha-tubulin within assembled
microtubules is detyrosinated over time at the C terminus. After
microtubule disassembly, TTL restores the tyrosine residues and
consequently participates in a cycle of tubulin detyrosination and
tyrosination (Erck et al., 2003).

CLONING

Using degenerate primers based on porcine Ttl, Erck et al. (2003) cloned
mouse Ttl by RT-PCR of mouse fibroblast cell line total RNA. By
searching a database for sequences similar to mouse Ttl, followed by
RT-PCR of HeLa cell total RNA, Erck et al. (2003) cloned human TTL. The
deduced 377-amino acid protein contains conserved amino acids that form
an ATP-Mg(2+)-binding site. TTL shares more than 90% amino acid identity
with mouse, pig, rat, and bovine Ttl. Northern blot analysis detected a
TTL transcript of about 6.0 kb. By PCR, Erck et al. (2003) identified
several TTL splice variants in HeLa cell and human kidney tumor cDNA
that were not present in normal control blood cDNA. The variants were
truncated and showed deletions of exon 2 or 6, or both exon 2 and 6, as
well as a 90-bp insertion at the exon 1-exon 2 boundary.

GENE STRUCTURE

Erck et al. (2003) determined that the TTL gene contains 7 exons and
spans about 47 kb. Analysis of the 5-prime flanking region revealed
several GC-rich regions, a TATA box, a reverse CCAAT box, and an SP1
(189906) site. The mouse Ttl gene also contains 7 exons, but the introns
are much smaller than those in the human gene.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Erck et al. (2003) mapped the TTL gene to
chromosome 2q13. Using FISH, they mapped the mouse Ttl gene to
chromosome 2F3.

ANIMAL MODEL

Erck et al. (2005) found that Ttl-null mice were born at the expected
mendelian ratio and were indistinguishable from their wildtype
littermates at birth. However, they displayed defective breathing and
ataxia and died within 24 hours after birth. The organs of mutant mice
appeared normal, but mutant brains showed disorganization of neuronal
networks, including disruption of the corticothalamic loop. Cultured
Ttl-null neurons also displayed morphogenetic anomalies, including
accelerated and erratic neurite outgrowth and premature axonal
differentiation. These anomalies correlated with mislocalization of
Clip170 (RSN; 179838), which was lacking in neurite extensions and
growth cones. Erck et al. (2005) concluded that TTL is required for
neuronal organization and that tyrosinated tubulin is required for
proper control of neurite extensions.

613552	TITLE *613552 PIGEON, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF; PION
;;GAMMA-SECRETASE-ACTIVATING PROTEIN; GSAP
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Accumulation of neurotoxic amyloid-beta is a major hallmark of Alzheimer
disease (AD; 104300). Formation of amyloid-beta is catalyzed by
gamma-secretase (see PSEN1; 104311), a protease with numerous
substrates. PION, or GSAP, selectively increases amyloid-beta production
through a mechanism involving its interaction with both gamma-secretase
and its substrate, the amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP; 104760)
C-terminal fragment (APP-CTF) (He et al., 2010).

CLONING

The drug imatinib decreases production of amyloid-beta by inhibiting
gamma cleavage of APP-CTF. Using HEK293 cells for in vitro and
intact-cell photolabeling and affinity purification, followed by mass
spectrometry, He et al. (2010) identified the target of imatinib as a
16-kD C-terminal fragment of PION, which they called GSAP. The predicted
full-length human GSAP protein contains 854 amino acids. Its sequence,
particularly the C-terminal region, is highly conserved from chicken to
human. Real-time PCR detected Gsap expression in diverse mouse tissues,
with highest levels in lung, kidney, liver, and brain. Pulse-chain
analysis of mouse N2a neuroblastoma cells showed that endogenous Gsap
was synthesized as a 98-kD holoprotein that was rapidly processed into a
16-kD C-terminal fragment, which He et al. (2010) designated Gsap-16K.
At steady state, Gsap-16K was the predominant form. In a sucrose
gradient, endogenous N2a-cell Gsap cofractionated with a trans-Golgi
network marker and with gamma-secretase components.

GENE FUNCTION

APP-CTF is cleaved by gamma-secretase in the middle of its transmembrane
domain to generate amyloid-beta (gamma cleavage) and near its cytosolic
membrane to generate APP intracellular domain (AICD) (epsilon cleavage).
He et al. (2010) found that recombinant human GSAP-16K stimulated
amyloid-beta production in an in vitro gamma-secretase assay, inhibited
AICD production, and had no effect on cleavage of Notch (190198),
another gamma-secretase substrate. Knockdown of Gsap in mouse N2a cells
overexpressing APP decreased amyloid-beta concentration, increased AICD
concentration, and had no effect on alpha and beta cleavages of APP.
Overexpression of GSAP in HEK293 cells reduced AICD production. These
results indicated that GSAP differentially regulates gamma and epsilon
cleavage of APP-CTF to form amyloid-beta and AICD, respectively. Cell
fractionation and coimmunoprecipitation studies using N2a cells revealed
that endogenous Gsap formed a complex with gamma-secretase.
Coimmunoprecipitation and domain mapping studies in HEK293 cells showed
that cleavage of APP-CTF by gamma-secretase involved binding of GSAP to
the cytoplasmic domain APP-CTF. Gsap knockdown in a mouse model of
Alzheimer disease reduced amyloid-beta concentrations and plaque
formation without affecting Notch-dependent pathways. Studies in HEK293
and N2a cells demonstrated that imatinib achieved its
amyloid-beta-lowering effect by preventing interaction of GSAP with
APP-CTF. He et al. (2010) concluded that GSAP confers substrate
specificity on gamma-secretase by forming a ternary complex with
gamma-secretase and APP-CTF. They proposed that removal of GSAP from
this ternary complex alters the structural relationship between
gamma-secretase and APP-CTF, facilitating epsilon cleavage at the
expense of gamma cleavage.

MAPPING

Gross (2010) mapped the PION gene to chromosome 7q11.23 based on an
alignment of the PION sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC101499) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

611405	TITLE *611405 RNA TERMINAL PHOSPHATE CYCLASE-LIKE 1; RCL1
;;RPCL1;;
RNAC
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database analysis, followed by PCR, Billy et al. (2000) cloned RCL1
from a HeLa cell cDNA library. The RCL1 protein shares 97% amino
sequence identity with the mouse homolog, which shares 38% identity with
S. cerevisiae Rcl1. RCL1 and its homologs share similarity with RNA
terminal phosphate cyclases (see RTCD1; 611286), but they lack the
conserved histidine residue that acts as an adenylate acceptor.
Immunofluorescence studies localized both yeast and mouse Rcl1 and to
the nucleolus.

GENE FUNCTION

Billy et al. (2000) showed that Rcl1 is required for viability in yeast
and that depletion of Rcl1 caused slower growth characterized by a
progressively increased doubling time. Rcl1-mutant strains showed
decreased levels of 40S ribosomal subunits, resulting in decreases of
20S pre-rRNA and 18S rRNA levels. Northern blot analysis and primer
extension confirmed defects in cleavage and processing of the yeast 35S
pre-rRNA at the A0, A1, and A2 sites in Rcl1-mutant strains.
Immunoprecipitation studies showed that Rcl1 associated with U3 snoRNA
and 2 U3 snoRNA-associated proteins, although gradient analysis showed
that it is not a structural component. Billy et al. (2000) suggested
that Rcl1 associates specifically with U3 snoRNA within the large
nascent ribosomal complex.

Using glycerol gradient analysis of Rcl1 and Bms1 (611448) mutants,
Wegierski et al. (2001) showed that Bms1 and Rcl1 cosediment together in
the 10S complex and associate with nascent ribosomes.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the RCL1
gene to chromosome 9 (TMAP RH93863).

;;PRICKLE-LIKE 3;;
LIM DOMAIN ONLY 6; LMO6
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

In the study of a gene-rich region of the X chromosome, Fisher et al.
(1997) identified a novel gene, PRICKLE3, which they called LMO6. LMO6
was predicted to encode a product of 407 amino acids with significant
homology to proteins containing LIM domains, in particular, mouse testin
(TES; 606085). The LIM domain is a cysteine-rich sequence motif that
binds zinc atoms to form a specific protein-binding interface in
protein-protein interactions. Like testin, the LMO6 product contains 3
such domains. Using RT-PCR, Fisher et al. (1997) amplified a 450-bp
product spanning exons 5 to 7 of the LMO6 transcript from lymphoblastoid
RNA. This confirmed that the LMO6 locus is transcribed and unlikely to
be a pseudogene.

GENE STRUCTURE

Fisher et al. (1997) determined that the PRICKLE3 gene contains 8 exons.

MAPPING

Fisher et al. (1997) mapped the PRICKLE3 gene to chromosome
Xp11.23-p11.22, within a 12.5-kb interval between the A4 (300112) and
the SYP (313475) genes.

;;JUMONJI, AT-RICH INTERACTIVE DOMAIN 1C; JARID1C;;
SELECTED cDNA ON X, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF; SMCX;;
XE169;;
DXS1272E
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The KDM5C gene encodes a specific H3K4me3 and H3K4me2 demethylase, and
acts as a transcriptional repressor through the RE-1-silencing
transcription factor (REST) complex (Tahiliani et al., 2007).

CLONING

Wu et al. (1994) reported the isolation and characterization of cDNAs
for XE169, a non-pseudoautosomal region (PAR)-encoded human gene. The
sequence appeared to represent a full-length or nearly full-length cDNA
for the gene. Alternative splicing generates 2 distinct transcripts,
either containing or missing 9 nucleotides, which in turn predicts 2
XE169 protein isoforms composed of 1,557 and 1,560 amino acids,
respectively. XE169 is expressed in multiple human tissues, and
homologous sequences exist on the human Y chromosome and in the genomes
of 5 other eutherian mammals examined. RT-PCR analysis of somatic cell
hybrids containing either an active or an inactive human X chromosome on
a rodent background demonstrated that XE169 escapes X inactivation.

Jensen et al. (2005) reported that the JARID1C protein shares amino acid
identity of 85%, 51%, and 47% with JARID1D/SMCY (426000), JARID1A
(180202), and JARID1B (605393), respectively. The JARID1C protein
contains several domains conserved among the JARID proteins, including a
JmjN domain, an Arid/Bright domain, a JmjC domain, a C5HC2 zinc finger
domain, and PHD zinc finger domains. Northern blot analysis detected
varying expression of a 6.0-kb transcript in almost all adult human
tissues examined, with strongest expression in brain and skeletal muscle
and weakest expression in heart and liver.

GENE FUNCTION

The JARID1C gene was thought to escape X inactivation. Agulnik et al.
(1994) observed that in hamster/human hybrids, Jarid1c was expressed
when either an active or an inactive human X chromosome was present.
Furthermore, 2 alleles of Smcx were found to be expressed in t(16;X)16H
female mice despite the intact X chromosome being inactive in all cells.
Lingenfelter et al. (1998) showed that Smcx is susceptible to complete X
inactivation in a portion of mouse embryonic cells. Furthermore, Smcx
inactivation persists in some cells at least until 13.5 days postcoitum.
A highly variable Smcx expression found during mouse development
progressively disappears in adult tissues where nearly equal expression
between alleles is observed. Sheardown et al. (1996) demonstrated that
the mouse Jarid1c gene exhibits partial X inactivation in embryos, in
extraembryonic lineages, and in several adult tissues, showing an
expression of 20 to 70% from the inactive, compared with the active, X
allele. Xu et al. (2002) observed that Jarid1c and Jarid1d are expressed
in mouse brain in a sex-specific fashion; in adult mouse brain, Jarid1c
is expressed at a significantly higher level in females than in males,
and expression of Jarid1d in males was not sufficient to compensate for
the female bias in X-gene expression. Therefore, Jensen et al. (2005)
suggested that the X-Y gene pair JARID1C and JARID1D may not be
functionally equivalent, suggesting an indispensable role for JARID1C in
normal brain function.

Tahiliani et al. (2007) showed that JARID1C/SMCX, a JmjC
domain-containing protein implicated in X-linked mental retardation and
epilepsy, possesses H3K4 tridemethylase activity and functions as a
transcriptional repressor. An SMCX complex isolated from HeLa cells
contained additional chromatin modifiers (the histone deacetylases HDAC1
(601241) and HDAC2 (605164), and the histone H3K9 methyltransferase G9a
(604599)) and the transcriptional repressor REST (600571), suggesting a
direct role for SMCX in chromatin dynamics and REST-mediated repression.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed that SMCX and REST co-occupy the
neuron-restrictive silencing elements in the promoters of a subset of
REST target genes. RNA interference-mediated depletion of SMCX
derepressed several of these targets and simultaneously increased H3K4
trimethylation at the sodium channel type 2A (SCN2A; 182390) and
synapsin I (SYN1; 313440) promoters. Tahiliani et al. (2007) proposed
that loss of SMCX activity impairs REST-mediated neuronal gene
regulation, thereby contributing to SMCX-associated X-linked mental
retardation.

Using a genomewide small interfering RNA screen and secondary screens,
Smith et al. (2010) identified 96 cellular genes that contributed to
viral E2 protein-mediated repression of the human papillomavirus (HPV)
long control region, which controls viral oncogene expression. In
addition to the E2-binding protein BRD4 (608749), other genes implicated
included the demethylase SMCX and EP400 (606265), a component of the
NUA4/TIP60 histone acetyltransferase complex (see 601409). Smith et al.
(2010) concluded that HPV E2 uses multiple cellular proteins to inhibit
expression of its oncogenes.

GENE STRUCTURE

Jensen et al. (2005) stated that the SMCX gene comprises 26 exons.

MAPPING

By Southern hybridization analysis of a panel of human/mouse somatic
cell hybrids containing various portions of translocated human X
chromosomes, Wu et al. (1994) assigned the XE169 gene to the proximal
half of the short arm of the X chromosome between Xp21.1 and the
centromere.

Wu et al. (1994) assigned Xe169 to band F2/F3 on the mouse X chromosome
by fluorescence in situ hybridization, and Southern analysis indicated
that the gene is located outside the pseudoautosomal region.

Using direct in situ hybridization, Agulnik et al. (1994) mapped the
mouse Smcx gene to the distal end of the X chromosome (XF2-XF4) and its
human homolog, SMCX, to proximal Xp (Xp11.2-p11.1). Meiotic mapping in
the mouse placed Smcx in the interval between Plp and Pdha1.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a systematic screen of brain-expressed genes from the proximal Xp and
pericentromeric regions of the X chromosome in 210 families with
X-linked mental retardation (XLMR), Jensen et al. (2005) identified
mutations in the JARID1C gene in affected members of 7 families with
MRXSCJ (300534), including 1 frameshift and 2 nonsense mutations, as
well as 4 missense mutations that altered evolutionarily conserved amino
acids. In 2 of these families, expression studies revealed the almost
complete absence of the mutated JARID1C transcript, suggesting that the
phenotype in these families resulted from functional loss of the JARID1C
protein. The JARID1C gene, formerly known as SMCX, is highly similar to
the Y chromosome gene that encodes the H-Y antigen variously known as
JARID1D, SMCY, and HYA (426000). Jensen et al. (2005) noted that in
families with nonsyndromic XLMR, more than 30% of mutations seem to
cluster on the proximal part of the short arm of the X chromosome and in
the pericentric region. The authors estimated that the frequency of
mutations in the JARID1C gene account for 2.8% to 3.3% families with
XLMR.

In 4 of 287 probands with X-linked mental retardation, Abidi et al.
(2008) identified 4 different mutations in the JARID1C gene (see, e.g.,
314690.0007).

Poeta et al. (2013) found that ARX (300382) bound to conserved noncoding
elements in the 5-prime region of the KDM5C gene, resulting in increased
expression of KDM5C. In vitro cellular expression studies showed that
transfection of 5 ARX mutants (see, e.g., 300382.0022) that cause
intellectual disability or severe epilepsy resulted in variably
decreased activation of the KDM5C gene compared to wildtype ARX. The
changes in polyA repeats caused hypomorphic ARX alterations, which
exhibit a decreased transactivity and reduced, but not abolished,
binding to the KDM5C regulatory region. The altered functioning of the
mutants tested correlated with the severity of the associated phenotype.
Quantitative RT-PCR studies showed a dramatic decrease of Kdm5c mRNA in
murine Arx-null embryonic and neural stem cells. The decrease in the
KDM5C content during in vitro neuronal differentiation inversely
correlated with increased histone regulation, as measured by H3K4me3
levels. The findings linked ARX polyA expansions to KDM5C, mutations of
which cause a similar phenotype, and established that ARX polyA
alterations damage the regulation of KDM5C expression, suggesting a
pathogenic pathway involving changes in chromatin remodeling in these
neurologic disorders.

OTHER FEATURES

Agulnik et al. (1994) isolated a mouse Y chromosome gene from the region
encoding Spy, a spermatogenesis gene, and Hya and Sdma, the genes that,
respectively, control the expression of the male specific minor
histocompatibility antigen H-Y, as measured by specific T-cell assays,
and the serologically detected male antigen SDMA. See 426000 for a
discussion of SMCY (so named for 'selected mouse cDNA on Y') and its
human homolog. The murine gene maps to Yp; the human homolog, SMCY, maps
to Yq.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MENTAL RETARDATION, X-LINKED, SYNDROMIC, CLAES-JENSEN TYPE
KDM5C, LEU731PHE

In affected members of a family with syndromic X-linked mental
retardation (300534) originally reported by Claes et al. (2000), Jensen
et al. (2005) detected a C-to-T transition at nucleotide 2191 in exon 16
of the JARID1C gene that changed leucine to phenylalanine at codon 731
(L731F). Jensen et al. (2005) suggested that the L731F mutation, which
is located in an evolutionarily conserved C5HC2 zinc finger domain, may
have a profound effect on that domain as a result of the difference in
size and chemical properties between leucine and phenylalanine.

.0002
MENTAL RETARDATION, X-LINKED, SYNDROMIC, CLAES-JENSEN TYPE
KDM5C, 1-BP INS, 202C

In 2 brothers with a severe form of mental retardation (300534), Jensen
et al. (2005) identified a single-nucleotide insertion of a cytidine
(202_203insC) in exon 2 of the JARID1C gene that introduced a frameshift
with premature stop codon at codon 75 (R68fsX7). The change was not
found in 312 control X chromosomes. The authors suggested that the
mutation, which did not seem to undergo nonsense-mediated decay (NMD),
may cause the aberrant phenotype through either extreme shortening of
the protein and deletion of relevant domains, or through production of
an abnormal protein by alternative use of a methionine downstream of
exon 2. With an almost identical phenotype, both brothers had had
removal of the gallbladder because of gallstones, at ages 20 and 31
years, respectively.

.0003
MENTAL RETARDATION, X-LINKED, SYNDROMIC, CLAES-JENSEN TYPE
KDM5C, ALA388PRO

In a family with 4 males who presented with mental retardation and
microcephaly (300534), Jensen et al. (2005) observed an 1162G-to-C
transversion in exon 9 of the JARID1C gene that caused an ala388-to-pro
(A388P) amino acid substitution.

.0004
MENTAL RETARDATION, X-LINKED, SYNDROMIC, CLAES-JENSEN TYPE
KDM5C, ARG694TER

In 2 brothers with X-linked mental retardation and short stature
(300534), Jensen et al. (2005) found a 2080C-to-T transition in exon 15
of the JARID1C gene that caused a premature termination at arg694
(R694X). KDM5C mRNA expression was almost undetectable, indicating
nonsense-mediated decay (NMD).

.0005
MENTAL RETARDATION, X-LINKED, SYNDROMIC, CLAES-JENSEN TYPE
KDM5C, SER451ARG

In 2 male sibs with X-linked mental retardation (300534), Santos et al.
(2006) identified a 1353C-G transversion in exon 10 of the JARID1C gene,
resulting in a ser451-to-arg (S451R) substitution. The unaffected mother
was heterozygous for the mutation, which was not identified in 250
control chromosomes.

.0006
MENTAL RETARDATION, X-LINKED, SYNDROMIC, CLAES-JENSEN TYPE
KDM5C, ARG766TRP

In a 4-year-old boy with cognitive impairment (300534), Adegbola et al.
(2008) identified a hemizygous 2296C-T transition in exon 16 of the
JARID1C gene, resulting in an arg766-to-trp (R766W) substitution. His
unaffected mother also carried the mutation. Detailed neuropsychologic
testing of the patient showed significant delays in perception, fine
motor skills, cognitive and language skills, and difficulty with
self-regulation. He also showed impairments in social reciprocity and
use of nonverbal behavior, stereotyped mannerisms, and adherence to
routine, consistent with autistic spectrum disorder. Although he had no
dysmorphic features as observed in many patients with KDM5C-related
mental retardation, Adegbola et al. (2008) noted that the phenotype
associated with mutations in the KDM5C gene is variable with regard to
dysmorphism and cognitive impairment; the authors suggested that this
patient falls within a milder end of the spectrum.

.0007
MENTAL RETARDATION, X-LINKED, SYNDROMIC, CLAES-JENSEN TYPE
KDM5C, ALA77THR

In affected members of a family with X-linked mental retardation
(300534), Abidi et al. (2008) identified a 229G-A transition in exon 3
of the JARID1C gene, resulting in an ala77-to-thr (A77T) substitution in
the ARID/BRIGHT domain. Additional features included short stature,
deep-set eyes, prominent nasal bridge, prominent ears, clubfeet, and
aggressive behavior. Three carrier females had mild mental retardation.
The mutation was not identified in 782 control X chromosomes.

.0008
MENTAL RETARDATION, X-LINKED, SYNDROMIC, CLAES-JENSEN TYPE
KDM5C, CYS724TER

In affected members of a Brazilian family with X-linked mental
retardation (300534), Santos-Reboucas et al. (2011) identified a 2172C-A
transversion in exon 15 of the KDM5C gene, resulting in a cys724-to-ter
(C724X) substitution in the C5HC2 zinc finger domain, resulting in
decreased protein expression likely from nonsense-mediated mRNA decay.
There were 3 affected brothers with severe mental retardation, poor
speech, short stature, low weight, microcephaly, high palate, slight
maxillary hypoplasia, and small feet. Their mother, who also carried the
mutation, was mildly cognitively impaired.

.0009
MENTAL RETARDATION, X-LINKED, SYNDROMIC, CLAES-JENSEN TYPE
KDM5C, PRO554THR

In affected members of a family with X-linked mental retardation
(300534), Rujirabanjerd et al. (2010) identified a 1160C-A transversion
in exon 12 of the KDM5C gene, resulting in a pro554-to-thr (P554T)
substitution at a highly conserved residue in the core of the JmjC
domain. Although the family had previously been designated as
nonsyndromic MRX13 (Kerr et al., 1992), Rujirabanjerd et al. (2010)
noted that affected individuals had short stature, large ears, and
microcephaly in addition to moderate intellectual disability. Two of 6
female carriers had learning difficulties. In vitro functional
expression studies showed that the mutant protein had significantly
decreased demethylase activity compared to wildtype. In an erratum, the
authors confirmed that the mutation was P554T; the mutation was
incorrectly stated as P544T in the abstract and text of their article.

603255	TITLE *603255 NUCLEAR TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR, X BOX-BINDING, 1; NFX1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Expression of class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules
is usually restricted to cells of the immune system and dysregulated
expression is thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of a severe
combined immunodeficiency syndrome and certain autoimmune diseases. See
RFX5 (601863). MHC class II gene expression is controlled primarily at
the transcriptional level by transcription factors that bind to the X
and Y boxes, 2 highly conserved elements in the proximal promoter of MHC
class II genes. The X box is further subdivided into an upstream X1 box
and an X2 box.

CLONING

Raji cells are an EBV-transformed human B lymphoblastoid cell line that
expresses MHC class II molecules. By screening a Raji cell cDNA
expression library for the ability to bind oligonucleotides that contain
X box sequences, Song et al. (1994) isolated NFX1 cDNAs. The predicted
1,104-amino acid protein has a central cysteine-rich DNA-binding domain
that is subdivided into 7 repeated motifs; the motif is similar to, but
distinct from, LIM (see 601999) and RING finger (see 602045) domains.
Two acidic regions surround the cysteine-rich domain. Northern blot
analysis revealed that NFX1 was expressed as an approximately 4-kb mRNA.
Using RT-PCR and an RNase protection assay, Song et al. (1994) found
NFX1 expression in all cell lines tested, regardless of the MHC class II
phenotype.

Arlotta et al. (2002) cloned the mouse homolog of NFX1. The N and C
termini of the mouse protein share 70% and 88% homology with those of
the human protein, respectively, and mouse Nfx1 contains the conserved
central cysteine-rich DNA-binding motif, which is 95% homologous to that
of the human protein. Arlotta et al. (2002) noted that other studies
identified an important role for NFX1 in neuronal development.

GENE FUNCTION

Song et al. (1994) showed that recombinant NFX1 bound specifically to
the X1 boxes of HLA-DRA (142860) and other MHC class II genes in vitro.
Overexpression of NFX1 specifically repressed transcription of HLA-DRA.
Song et al. (1994) concluded that NFX1 is a potent and biologically
relevant repressor of HLA-DRA transcription.

MAPPING

Arlotta et al. (2002) mapped the mouse Nfx1 gene to the proximal region
of chromosome 4 by interspecific backcross analysis. By homology of
synteny, genomic sequence analysis, and other methods, they mapped the
human NFX1 gene to chromosome 9p13 in close proximity to the CNTFR gene
(118946).

605213	TITLE *605213 3-@PHOSPHOINOSITIDE-DEPENDENT PROTEIN KINASE 1; PDPK1
;;PDK1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Isoforms of protein kinase B (PKB, or AKT1; 164730) are overexpressed in
some ovarian, pancreatic, and breast cancer cells, and PKB has been
shown to protect cells from apoptosis. Activation of PKB, which is
preventable by inhibitors of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (see PIK3CG;
601232), is stimulated by insulin or growth factors after
phosphorylation of PKB at thr308 and ser473. Alessi et al. (1997)
biochemically purified a protein kinase, which they called PDK1, that
phosphorylates PKB at thr308 in response to phosphatidylinositol
3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) or phosphatidylinositol
3,4-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4)P2) and enhances PKB activity. By
microsequence analysis of the approximately 67- to 69-kD PDK1 protein,
searching an EST database, and probing a breast cancer cell line cDNA
library, Alessi et al. (1997) isolated a cDNA encoding PDK1, also called
PDPK1. Sequence analysis predicted that the 556-amino acid PDPK1 protein
contains a catalytic domain with 11 classic kinase subdomains and a
C-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain.

GENE FUNCTION

Alessi et al. (1997) found that expression of recombinant PDPK1 resulted
in the activation and phosphorylation of PKB at thr308 in a
PtdIns(3,4,5)P3- or PtdIns(3,4)P2-dependent manner via the PH domains.

Stephens et al. (1998) demonstrated that PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and
PtdIns(3,4)P2 bind to the PH domains of PKB and PDPK1, causing their
translocation to the membrane and leading to PKB activation.

Pullen et al. (1998) showed that PDPK1 selectively phosphorylates the
70-kD ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70-RPS6K) at thr229, which is
required for its activation. Thr229 of p70-RPS6K is homologous to thr308
of the PKB protein.

Using transfected HEK293 cells stimulated with pervanadate or insulin,
Park et al. (2001) found that PDK1 becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated and
translocates to the plasma membrane. Following pervanadate treatment,
PDK1 kinase activity increased 1.5- to 3-fold, whereas the activity of
PDK1 associated with the plasma membrane increased approximately 6-fold.
The activity localized to the plasma membrane was also increased by
insulin treatment. Using site-directed mutants, they determined that
phosphorylation of tyr373/tyr376 is important for PDK1 activity.

Activation of the transcription factor NF-kappa-B (see 164011) after
engagement of the T cell receptor (TCR) is important for T cell
proliferation and activation during the adaptive immune response. Lee et
al. (2005) demonstrated that PDK1 has an essential role in this pathway
by regulating the activation of PKC-theta (PRKCQ; 600448) and through
signal-dependent recruiting of both PKC-theta and CARD11 (607210) to
lipid rafts. PDK1-associated PKC-theta recruits the IKK complex, whereas
PDK1-associated CARD11 recruits the Bcl10-MALT1 complex (see 604860),
thereby allowing activation of the IKK complex through
Bcl10-MALT1-dependent ubiquitination of the IKK complex subunit NEMO
(300248). Lee et al. (2005) concluded that PDK1 plays a critical role by
nucleating the TCR-induced NF-kappa-B activation pathway in T cells.

Gruber et al. (2006) commented on the study of Lee et al. (2005),
stating they observed that PKC-theta is phosphorylated on the activation
loop at thr538 before T cell activation. The results of Gruber et al.
(2006) are therefore inconsistent with the conclusions of Lee et al.
(2005) that thr538 phosphorylation of PKC-theta is regulated by T-cell
receptor activation. They postulated that other mechanisms, such as
autophosphorylation of thr219, might orchestrate the cellular function
of PKC-theta in T cells. Lee et al. (2006) responded to the comments of
Gruber et al. (2006) to state that several other groups have replicated
their data regarding inducible phosphorylation of thr538 in T cells. Lee
et al. (2006) noted that although the physiologic relevance of the
discrepancy is unclear, substantial differences and experimental
conditions and reagents may have accounted for the conflicting
observations.

In 3-dimensional matrices, cancer cells move with a rounded, amoeboid
morphology that is controlled by ROCK1-dependent contraction of
actomyosin. Using human cancer cell lines, Pinner and Sahai (2008)
showed that PDK1 was required for phosphorylation of myosin light chain
(see 160780) and cell motility, both on deformable gels and in vivo.
Depletion of PDK1 via RNA interference altered the localization of ROCK1
and reduced its ability to drive cortical actomyosin contraction. This
form of ROCK1 regulation did not require PDK1 kinase activity. Instead,
PDK1 competed directly with RHOE (RND3; 602924) for binding to ROCK1 and
opposed inhibition of ROCK1 by RHOE.

MAPPING

Alessi et al. (1997) and Stephens et al. (1998) mapped the PDPK1 gene to
16p13.3 based on its identity to a sequence located in the same region
as the PKD1 (601313) and TSC2 (191092) loci (Burn et al., 1996).

ANIMAL MODEL

Lawlor et al. (2002) found that Pdk1-null mice died at embryonic day 9.5
with multiple abnormalities, including lack of somites, forebrain, and
neural crest-derived tissues. Development of hind- and midbrain,
however, proceeded relatively normally. Lawlor et al. (2002) developed a
mouse strain that showed reduced levels of Pdk1 activity. These
hypomorphic Pdk1 mice were viable and fertile, and insulin injection
induced the normal phosphorylation responses attributed to Pdk1
activation. Nevertheless, these mice were 40 to 50% smaller than control
animals. The organ volumes from the Pdk1 hypomorphic mice were reduced
proportionally, and the volume of a number of Pdk1-deficient cells was
reduced by 35 to 60%. Pdk1 deficiency seemed to regulate cell size
directly and independently of cell number or proliferation rate.

The PDK1 'master kinase' mediates activation of AGC serine kinases (PKA,
PKG, and PKC (see 176960)) by phosphorylating them at the 'T-loop' site
of their catalytic domains. In order to determine the role of AGC serine
kinases in T-cell development, Hinton et al. (2004) used conditional
gene deletion of Pdk1 in mouse T cells to avoid embryonic lethality.
Complete loss of Pdk1 blocked T-cell differentiation in thymus, whereas
reducing Pdk1 activity to 10% of normal allowed differentiation to
proceed but blocked thymic expansion.

Hashimoto et al. (2006) investigated the role of PDK1, a
serine-threonine kinase, in regulating islet mass via a signaling
pathway that includes INSR (147670) or IGF1R (147370), IRS1 (147545),
and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). Hashimoto et al. (2006) showed
that mice lacking Pdk1 specifically in pancreatic beta cells developed
progressive hyperglycemia as a result of loss of islet mass. The mice
showed reductions in islet density as well as in number and size of beta
cells. Haploinsufficiency of the Foxo1 gene (136533) resulted in a
marked increase in the number, but not the size, of beta cells and
resulted in restoration of glucose homeostasis in beta cell-specific
Pdk1-null mice. Hashimoto et al. (2006) suggested that PDK1 is important
in maintenance of pancreatic beta cell mass and glucose homeostasis.

In mice lacking Pdk1 in oocytes, Reddy et al. (2009) demonstrated that
the majority of primordial follicles were depleted around the onset of
sexual maturity, causing premature ovarian failure (POF) during early
adulthood. Suppressed PDK1-Akt1 (164730)-S6K1 (RPS6KB1; 608938)-RPS6
(180460) signaling in oocytes appeared to be responsible for the loss of
primordial follicles, and mice lacking the Rps6 gene in oocytes showed
POF similar to that in Pdk1-deficient mice. Reddy et al. (2009)
concluded that the PI3K/PTEN (601728)-PDK1 signaling pathway in oocytes
controls the survival, loss, and activation of primordial follicles
(which together determine reproductive aging and the length of
reproductive life in females), and that underactivation or

611214	TITLE *611214 TSR1, 20S rRNA ACCUMULATION, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; TSR1
;;KIAA1401
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned TSR1, which they designated
KIAA1401. The deduced protein contains 853 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA
detected very high expression in all specific adult brain regions
examined. Intermediate expression was detected in heart, whole adult
brain, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, testis, ovary, and spinal cord,
and in fetal brain and liver. Little to no expression was detected in
pancreas and spleen.

Gelperin et al. (2001) identified yeast Tsr1, which encodes a 788-amino
acid protein with an N-terminal and C-terminal domain separated by a
central acidic domain. The tripartite organization shares similarity to
Bms1 (611448), but Tsr1 lacks the P-loop required for GTP binding and an
obvious nuclear localization signal.

GENE FUNCTION

Gelperin et al. (2001) showed that depletion of yeast Tsr1 resulted in
20S rRNA accumulation, suggesting that Tsr1 is required for assembly of
a transport- or maturation-competent particle or is specifically
required for transport of 43S pre-ribosomal particles, but not 60S
ribosome precursors, from the nucleus to the cytosol.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (2000) mapped the TSR1 gene
to chromosome 17.

601167	TITLE *601167 PURINERGIC RECEPTOR P2Y, G PROTEIN-COUPLED, 1; P2RY1
;;PURINOCEPTOR P2Y1; P2Y1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

P2 purinoceptors have been broadly classified as P2X receptors (e.g.,
600843), which are ATP-gated channels; P2Z receptors, which mediate
nonselective pores in mast cells; and P2Y receptors, a family of G
protein-coupled receptors. Based on the recommendation for nomenclature
of P2 purinoceptors, the P2Y purinoceptors were numbered in the order of
cloning. Ayyanathan et al. (1996) noted that P2Y1, P2Y2 (PR2Y2; 600041),
and P2Y3 have been cloned from a variety of species. P2Y1 responds to
both ADP and ATP. The P2Y2 receptor cDNA was cloned in the human and
this receptor was known as P2U under previous nomenclature. Ayyanathan
et al. (1996) cloned the human P2Y1 receptor (P2RY1) and its 2
alternately polyadenylated forms of mRNA. The P2Y1 purinoceptor was also
cloned from a human placenta cDNA library by Leon et al. (1996). They
found that the gene encodes a 372-amino acid polypeptide. Northern blot
analysis revealed 2 transcripts of 4.6 and 7.5 kb which were expressed
in many tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

Leon et al. (1997) expressed the cloned P2Y1 gene in Jurkat T
lymphocytes, a cell line that is not naturally responsive to
nucleotides. They treated the transfected cells with ATP and measured
Ca(2+) fluxes and responses to agonists. The pharmacologic properties of
the P2Y1 receptor are similar to those of the P2T ADP receptor that is
responsible for platelet aggregation. They showed that the P2Y1 receptor
is expressed by human platelets and megakaryoblasts. The authors
suggested that the P2Y1 receptor may be the P2T receptor.

Adrian et al. (2000) analyzed the expression of several purinergic
receptors during differentiation in a promyelocytic leukemia cell line.
Granulocytic differentiation was induced by dimethylsulfoxide, and a
monocytic/macrophage phenotype was induced by phorbol esters. No change
from the moderate basal expression of P2Y1 was detected during
granulocytic differentiation. During monocytic differentiation,
expression was transiently upregulated about 3-fold and returned to
preinduction levels after 36 hours.

Mutafova-Yambolieva et al. (2007) identified P2ry1 as a receptor for
beta-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (beta-NAD) by measuring
receptor-mediated responses in HEK293 cells transfected with guinea pig
P2ry1. They found that beta-NAD behaved as an inhibitory
neurotransmitter in mouse colonic muscle. Beta-NAD was released by
stimulation of enteric nerves of mouse gastrointestinal muscles, and
release of beta-NAD depended on the frequency of nerve stimulation.
Responses to beta-NAD and inhibitory junction potentials were blocked by
a P2Y1-selective antagonist and by nonselective P2 receptor antagonists
in mouse colonic muscles.

Masse et al. (2007) determined that ectonucleoside triphosphate
diphosphohydrolase-2 (ENTPD2; 602012), an ectoenzyme that converts ATP
to ADP, acts upstream of the eye field transcription factors Pax6
(607108), Rx1, and Six3 (603714). To test whether ADP, the product of
ENTPD2, might act to trigger eye development through P2Y1 receptors,
selective in Xenopus for ADP, Masse et al. (2007) simultaneously knocked
down expression of the genes encoding ENTPD2 and the P2Y1 receptor. This
prevented the expression of Rx1 and Pax6 and eye formation completely.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ayyanathan et al. (1996) amplified the genomic region encoding the P2RY1
receptor and found that the gene contains no introns.

MAPPING

Using oligonucleotide primers specific for the human P2Y1 purinergic
receptor, Ayyanathan et al. (1996) amplified a region from genomic DNA
from a panel of mouse/human somatic cell hybrid cell lines and localized
the P2Y1 gene to human chromosome 3.

By sequence tagged site (STS) mapping utilizing the National Center for
Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database, Somers et al. (1997) mapped
the P2RY1 gene between flanking markers D3S1279 and D3S1280 at a
position 173 to 174 cM from the most telomeric markers on the short arm
of chromosome 3.

Ayyanathan et al. (1996) localized the P2RY1 gene to chromosome 3q25 by
PCR of a subchromosomal hybrid panel.

ANIMAL MODEL

Leon et al. (1999) generated P2Y1-null mice to define the physiologic
role of the P2Y1 receptor. These mice were viable with no apparent
abnormalities affecting their development, survival, reproduction, or
morphology of platelets, and the platelet count in these animals was
identical to that of wildtype mice. However, platelets from
P2Y1-deficient mice were unable to aggregate in response to usual
concentrations of ADP and displayed impaired aggregation to other
agonists, while high concentrations of ADP induced platelet aggregation
without shape change. In addition, ADP-induced inhibition of adenylyl
cyclase still occurred, demonstrating the existence of an ADP receptor
distinct from P2Y1. P2Y1-null mice had no spontaneous bleeding tendency
but were resistant to thromboembolism induced by intravenous injection
of ADP or collagen and adrenaline. Hence, the P2Y1 receptor plays an
essential role in thrombotic states and represents a potential target
for antithrombotic drugs.

605612	TITLE *605612 SH3 DOMAIN-BINDING PROTEIN 5; SH3BP5
;;SAB
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK; 300300) is a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase
crucial for the maturation of B-lineage cells. By Far Western expression
cloning using a human placenta cDNA library for molecules associated
with the SH3 domain of BTK, followed by screening brain and B-cell cDNA
libraries, Matsushita et al. (1998) obtained a cDNA encoding SH3BP5,
which they termed SAB (SH3 domain-binding protein that preferentially
associates with BTK). SH3BP5 encodes a deduced 425-amino acid protein.
Northern blot analysis revealed wide expression of a 3.0-kb transcript,
with especially prominent expression in testis and ovary. Immunoblot
analysis showed that SH3BP5 is expressed as a 70-kD protein.
Immunoprecipitation analysis suggested that SH3BP5 interacts with BTK in
cells. Mutational and immunoblot analyses showed that amino acids 163 to
193 of SH3BP5 bind most strongly to the SH3 domain of BTK and not with
the SH3 domains of a number of other cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases.

GENE FUNCTION

Using immunoprecipitation and functional analysis, Yamadori et al.
(1999) demonstrated that SH3BP5 inhibits BTK activity by binding to the
enzyme.

MAPPING

Using FISH, Baba et al. (1999) mapped the SH3BP5 gene to 1q43. They
mapped the mouse gene to chromosome 14B.
