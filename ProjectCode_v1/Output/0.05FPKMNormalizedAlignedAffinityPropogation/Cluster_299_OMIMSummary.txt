611335	TITLE *611335 SMALL NUCLEOLAR RNA, H/ACA BOX, 5C; SNORA5C
;;snoRNA, HBI-80
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs involved in RNA
processing. Box H/ACA snoRNAs, such as SNORA5C, direct the conversion of
uridine to pseudouridine at specific residues of ribosomal RNAs or small
nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) (Gu et al., 2005).

CLONING

By RT-PCR of human blood total RNA, Gu et al. (2005) identified several
box H/ACA snoRNAs, including SNORA5C, which they called HBI-80. HBI-80
contains 102 nucleotides.

GENE FUNCTION

Based on sequence complementarity, Gu et al. (2005) predicted that
HBI-80 pseudouridylates U1625 of 18S ribosomal RNA (see 180450).

MAPPING

Gu et al. (2005) mapped the SNORA5C gene to chromosome 7, within intron
3 of the TBRG4 gene (611325).

PLATELET PROTEOGLYCAN PROTEIN CORE; PPG;;
PROTEOGLYCAN PROTEIN CORE FOR MAST CELL SECRETORY GRANULE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The proteoglycans that are stored in the secretory granules of many
hematopoietic cells contain a peptide core, termed serglycin (or
'serine/glycine-rich peptide core of secretory granule proteoglycan'),
with a protease-resistant, glycosaminoglycan-attachment region
consisting predominantly of alternating serine and glycine residues
(summary by Humphries et al., 1992). Serglycin proteoglycans have been
isolated that contain O-linked heparin, heparan sulfate, chondroitin
sulfate A, etc.

CLONING

The promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60 is a transformed human cell
that synthesizes chondroitin sulfate to proteoglycans and stores the
proteoglycans in its secretory granules. Under certain in vitro
conditions this cell can be induced to differentiate into cells that
resemble neutrophils, monocyte-macrophages, eosinophils, and basophils.
Stevens et al. (1988) used a rat cell-derived cDNA for a proteoglycan to
isolate a cDNA from an HL-60 cell cDNA library. As assessed by Northern
and Southern blot analyses, a single gene encodes the 1.3-kb mRNA for
this proteoglycan peptide core. The deduced amino acid sequence includes
an 18-amino acid glycosaminoglycan attachment region that consists
primarily of alternating serine and glycine.

Perin et al. (1988) characterized the protein core of platelet
proteoglycan and Alliel et al. (1988) determined its complete amino acid
structure by a combination of protein and cDNA sequencing.

Mattei et al. (1989) found that the sequence of the peptide core of the
secretory granule proteoglycan was identical to that of PPG.

Bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMC) synthesize 200- to 250-kD highly
acidic proteoglycans containing glycosaminoglycans that are almost
exclusively chondroitin sulfate E. These intracellular proteoglycans are
stored in secretory granules. Avraham et al. (1989) isolated and
sequenced a full-length cDNA from a mouse BMMC-derived cDNA library. The
same peptide core is found in all cells of bone marrow origin (Austen,
1990); see Rothenberg et al. (1988) and Avraham et al. (1988) for
information on the eosinophil proteoglycan and the basophil
proteoglycan, respectively. Differences in the secretory granules of the
several cell types are related to the sugar moieties that are
polymerized onto the glycine-serine copolymer to form the
glycosoaminoglycan.

Humphries et al. (1992) determined the complete nucleotide sequence of
the human serglycin gene.

MAPPING

By probing DNA from a panel of human/mouse and human/hamster hybrid
cells with the cDNA, Stevens et al. (1988) showed that the gene that
encodes the HL-60 cell proteoglycan peptide core resides on chromosome
10. The mouse gene encoding the proteoglycan peptide core is located on
chromosome 10 (Avraham et al., 1988).

Mattei et al. (1989) showed by in situ hybridization that the PRG1 gene
is located in band 10q22.1.

GENE STRUCTURE

Humphries et al. (1992) determined that the human serglycin gene
contains 3 exons and spans 16.7 kb. The exons and introns 1 and 2
comprise 7, 53, and 40% of the gene, respectively.
