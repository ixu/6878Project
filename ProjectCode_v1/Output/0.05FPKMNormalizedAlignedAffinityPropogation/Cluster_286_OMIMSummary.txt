DESCRIPTION The inflammatory cytokine I-309 is one of the small inducible
chemotactic and inflammatory peptides which have a hydrophobic leader
sequence typical of secreted proteins; in many cases the products have
indeed been demonstrated to be secreted. Comparison of amino acid
sequences of the gene products show that they share numerous conserved
amino acids, most notably 4 cysteine residues that are arranged in a
characteristic motif. The superfamily is divided into 2 subfamilies,
which are called CC or CXC, depending on whether the protein has 2
adjacent cysteine residues or has a single amino acid separating the 2
cysteine residues, respectively. Three characterized members of the CXC
family, platelet factor-4 (173460), INP10 (147310), and MGSA (155730),
have been mapped to chromosome 4, whereas members of the CC family, such
as RANTES (187011), have been mapped to chromosome 17. By study of a
panel of rodent-human somatic cell hybrids, Miller et al. (1990) mapped
the gene for I309 (SCYA1), a small secreted protein produced by
activated human T-lymphocytes, to chromosome 17. I309 is structurally
related to the CXC group of proteins. The homologous mouse gene is
termed Tca-3.
