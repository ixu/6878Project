SERINE-RICH SPERMATOCYTES AND ROUND SPERMATID PROTEIN, 59-KD; P59SCR;;
SCR59
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By immunoscreening of a mouse testis cDNA library using polyclonal
antibody against Tp73l (TP63; 603273), followed by database analysis,
Senoo et al. (2002) isolated Spats2, which they called p59Scr. The
545-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 59 kD. Spats2
has a basic amino acid-rich region, is rich in serine residues, and
contains 4 predicted N-glycosylation sites. Northern blot analysis of
mouse tissues detected strong expression in adult testis, moderate
expression in brain and thymus, and weak expression in ovary, kidney,
lung, heart, stomach, skeletal muscle. In situ hybridization of adult
mouse testis tissue demonstrated Spats2 expression that varied with the
seminiferous cycle during spermatogenesis, with cytoplasmic expression
in spermatocytes, round spermatids, and elongated spermatids. No
expression was detected in spermatogonia. In developing mouse testis,
Spats2 was detected at 1 week, increased rapidly to reach a maximum
level at 6 weeks, which coincides with testicular maturation, and
remained constant at a high level throughout adulthood.

GENE FUNCTION

Senoo et al. (2002) showed that mouse Spats2 mRNA levels in surgically
removed mouse testis decreased to 60% of the levels in scrotal testis at
8 days after surgery. Spats2 mRNA levels in surgically removed testis
subjected to high temperature stress decreased more than compared to
testis-specific kinase (MAK; 154235) and beta-actin (ACTB; 102630)
levels. Senoo et al. (2002) suggested that SPATS2 may play a role in
testicular germ cell development.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The 2-prime,5-prime oligoadenylate synthetases (OASs), such as OAS3, are
interferon-induced proteins characterized by their capacity to catalyze
the synthesis of 2-prime,5-prime oligomers of adenosine (2-5As)
(Hovnanian et al., 1998). For further information on OASs, see OAS1
(164350).

CLONING

Hovanessian et al. (1987) found that interferon-treated human cells
contain several OASs corresponding to proteins of 40 (OAS1), 46 (OAS1),
69 (OAS2; 603350), and 100 (OAS3) kD. Hovnanian et al. (1998) reported
that the predicted OAS3, or p100, protein contains 3 adjacent OAS1-like
domains. The domains share 44 to 60% protein sequence similarity with
each other and 42 to 60% sequence identity with the conserved domain of
OAS1. The authors noted that OAS1, OAS2, and OAS3 contain 1, 2, and 3
conserved OAS domains or units, respectively. Northern blot analysis
revealed that OAS3 is expressed as a 7-kb interferon-induced mRNA in
HeLa cells.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization and by inclusion within mapped
clones, Hovnanian et al. (1998) determined that the OAS1, OAS2, and OAS3
genes are clustered with a 130-kb region on chromosome 12q24.2.

103320	TITLE *103320 AGRIN; AGRN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Agrin is a neuronal aggregating factor that induces the aggregation of
acetylcholine receptors and other postsynaptic proteins on muscle fibers
and is crucial for the formation of the neuromuscular junction.

CLONING

Rupp et al. (1991) isolated cDNAs from a rat embryonic spinal cord
library using an agrin cDNA clone isolated from electromotor neurons of
a marine ray. Analysis of a set of clones predicted a protein with 1,940
amino acids, including 141 cysteine residues. The predicted protein had
9 domains homologous to protease inhibitors, a region similar to domain
III of laminin (see 150240), and 4 epidermal growth factor (131530)
repeats. The gene was expressed in rat embryonic nervous system and
muscle. The protein was concentrated at synapses. Rupp et al. (1992)
described alternative RNA splicing in mammalian agrin resulting in many
extracellular matrix protein isoforms.

MAPPING

Rupp et al. (1992) mapped the human AGRN gene to 1pter-p32 by analysis
of Chinese hamster/human somatic cell hybrids, including one that
carried chromosome 1 region p32-qter (which was negative for the human
signal). The mouse gene was mapped to chromosome 4 by study of Chinese
hamster/mouse somatic cell hybrids. Thus, this is another example of
extensive homology of synteny between 1pter-p32 and the distal half of
mouse chromosome 4. Three neurologic mutants in that region of mouse
chromosome 4 were pointed to as possible candidate diseases for
mutations in the Agrn gene.

GENE FUNCTION

An important event in synapse formation is the accumulation of
neurotransmitter receptors beneath the presynaptic nerve terminal. Agrin
is a component of the synaptic basal lamina that induces the clustering
(aggregation) of acetylcholine receptors (e.g., 100690) on cultured
muscle fibers. Campanelli et al. (1991) showed that when a cDNA encoding
a putative agrin protein is transfected into cells, the molecule is
secreted and concentrated on the extracellular surface. Coculture of
transfected cells with muscle fibers induced formation of receptor
patches at contact sites. These results demonstrated that expression of
a single gene encoding agrin confers receptor clustering that is
restricted to specific sites of contact between the synthesizing cell
and muscle. DeChiara et al. (1996) showed that agrin acts through the
skeletal muscle tyrosine kinase receptor MuSK (601296) to activate
signaling cascades responsible for all aspects of synapse formation,
including organization of the postsynaptic membrane, synapse-specific
transcription, and presynaptic differentiation. In mouse muscle and
cultured myotube cells, Finn et al. (2003) showed that the tyrosine
kinases Abl1 (189980) and Abl2 (164690) are concentrated at the
postsynaptic neuromuscular junction and are mediators of postsynaptic
AChR clustering downstream of agrin and MuSK signaling. The authors
suggested that the Abl kinases influence cytoskeletal regulatory
molecules important for synapse assembly and remodeling.

In cultured myocytes, Wang et al. (2003) found that agrin-induced AChR
postsynaptic aggregation required the tumor suppressor gene APC
(611731), which was found to colocalize and bind specifically to the
AChR beta subunit (100710). The interaction occurred downstream of MuSK
activation. Wang et al. (2003) suggested that a direct interaction
between APC and the AChR beta subunit may link AChR to the cytoskeleton,
helping to localize the receptors to the neuromuscular junction.

T-cell activation is dependent on both a primary signal delivered
through the T-cell receptor and a secondary costimulatory signal
mediated by coreceptors. Costimulation is thought to act through the
specific redistribution and clustering of membrane and intracellular
kinase-rich lipid raft microdomains at the contact site between T cells
and antigen-presenting cells. This site has been termed the immunologic
synapse. Khan et al. (2001) demonstrated that agrin, an aggregating
protein crucial for formation of the neuromuscular junction, is also
expressed in lymphocytes and is important in reorganization of membrane
lipid microdomains and setting the threshold for T-cell signaling. Khan
et al. (2001) concluded that agrin induces the aggregation of signaling
proteins and the creation of signaling domains in both immune and
nervous systems through a common lipid raft pathway.

In addition to its role at the neuromuscular junction, agrin has been
implicated in brain development. Through biochemical studies, Hilgenberg
et al. (2006) found that agrin bound the alpha-3 subunit of the
Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase (ATP1A3; 182350) in mouse cortical neurons.
Immunohistochemical analysis showed that Atp1a3 colocalized with
agrin-binding sites at synapses. Agrin inhibited Atp1a3 activity,
resulting in membrane depolarization and increased action potential
frequency in mouse cortical neurons in culture and acute slice. An agrin
fragment that acted as a competitive antagonist depressed action
potential frequency, indicating that endogenous agrin regulates native
Atp1a3 function. Hilgenberg et al. (2006) concluded that agrin regulates
activity-dependent processes in neurons through its interaction with
ATP1A3.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a Swiss brother and sister with congenital myasthenic syndrome
(254300), Huze et al. (2009) identified a homozygous mutation in the
AGRN gene (G1709R; 103320.0001). Mutant agrin was expressed and
localized correctly in patient muscle, but the overall organization of
the neuromuscular junction was perturbed, affecting both the pre- and
postsynaptic regions. AChR clustering and density was not affected. The
findings suggested that agrin also helps to maintain the neuromuscular
junction.

ANIMAL MODEL

Data on the structure, expression, and bioactivity of agrin all support
the notion that it plays a central role in regulating postsynaptic
differentiation. However, agrin is only one of several agents that can
cause clustering of acetylcholine receptors in vitro. To test critically
the 'agrin hypothesis' (McMahan, 1990), Gautam et al. (1996) generated
knockout mice deficient for agrin and showed that neuromuscular
differentiation is grossly defective in these mice. Some postsynaptic
differentiation occurred in the mutant, suggesting the existence of a
second nerve-derived synaptic organizing signal.

Formation of the neuromuscular junction depends upon reciprocal
inductive interactions between the developing nerve and muscle,
resulting in the precise juxtaposition of a differentiated nerve
terminal with a highly specialized patch on the muscle membrane, termed
the motor endplate. Agrin is a nerve-derived factor involved in
induction of the molecular reorganization at the motor endplate. Glass
et al. (1996) found that mice lacking either agrin or the receptor
tyrosine kinase MuSK (601296) exhibit similar profound defects at the
neuromuscular junction. DeChiara et al. (1996) showed in knockout mice
that MuSK is required for formation of the neuromuscular junction in
vivo.

Lin et al. (2001) analyzed early stages of postsynaptic differentiation
in muscles of mutant mice lacking agrin, MuSK, rapsyn (601592), and/or
motor nerves. Lin et al. (2001) found that the defect in MuSK mutants is
due to an absence of initiation of postsynaptic differentiation, whereas
the impairment in agrin mutants is caused by loss of agrin-dependent
maintenance of the postsynaptic apparatus. On the basis of these and
previous studies, Lin et al. (2001) proposed the existence of 3 early
overlapping steps in the formation of the postsynaptic apparatus at the
neuromuscular junction. First, a muscle-intrinsic,
nerve/agrin-independent and MuSK-dependent mechanism initiates formation
of postsynaptic specialization in an end-plate band. Second,
nerve-derived agrin acts through MuSK to promote apposition of nerve
terminals to these nerve-independent acetylcholine receptor clusters
and/or to induce new postsynaptic sites. Agrin is also required for the
growth and maintenance of most, if not all, synaptic sites. Third, motor
axons, or Schwann cells that accompany them, provide an
agrin-independent signal that destabilizes or disperses postsynaptic
apparatus that have not been stabilized by agrin.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MYASTHENIA, LIMB-GIRDLE, FAMILIAL
AGRN, GLY1709ARG

In a sister and brother with congenital myasthenic syndrome mostly
affecting the limb-girdle muscles (254300), Huze et al. (2009)
identified a homozygous 5125G-C transversion in exon 29 of the AGRN
gene, resulting in a gly1709-to-arg (G1709R) substitution in the
C-terminal laminin G-like 2 (LG2) domain. Both patients were unable to
run since childhood and had mild muscle weakness as adults. Neither had
diplopia, bulbar symptoms, or dyspnea. The mutation was not found in 200
control alleles. Skeletal muscle biopsy showed pre- and postsynaptic
defects at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), although mutant agrin
staining was localized correctly. In vitro functional expression studies
in myotubes showed that mutant agrin did not significantly impair AChR
clustering, activation of MuSK (601296), or the interaction with
alpha-dystroglycan (DAG; 128239). Injection of the mutant protein into
rat muscle did not affect AChR recruit or expression at the NMJ.
However, the NMJ showed remodeling and denervation: the presynaptic
department had disheveled neurofilaments, and the postsynaptic
compartment had increased synaptic gutter fragments. Huze et al. (2009)
concluded that the mutant agrin destabilized the preexisting NMJ,
suggesting that wildtype agrin is involved in the maintenance of the
NMJ.
