DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing cDNAs obtained from umbilical cord blood CD34
(142230)-positive hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, Mao et al. (1998)
cloned POLR1C, which they called RPA40. The deduced protein contains 342
amino acids.

By sequencing proteins contained within RNA polymerase III complexes
purified from HeLa cells, followed by database analysis, Hu et al.
(2002) identified POLR1C, which they called RPAC1. The deduced 342-amino
acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 38.6 kD and shares 47%
amino acid identity with its yeast homolog, AC40.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the POLR1C
gene to chromosome 6 (TMAP SHGC-53217).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Dauwerse et al. (2011) analyzed the POLR1C gene in 252 individuals with
Treacher Collins syndrome (TCS3; 248390) and identified 3 patients with
compound heterozygous mutations (610060.0001-610060.0005).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
TREACHER COLLINS SYNDROME 3
POLR1C, ARG279GLN

In a sister and brother and an unrelated male patient with Treacher
Collins syndrome-3 (TCS3; 248390), Dauwerse et al. (2011) identified
compound heterozygosity for an 836G-A transition in exon 8 of the POLR1C
gene, resulting in an arg279-to-gln (R279Q) substitution at a highly
conserved residue in the RNA polymerase dimerization domain of POLR1C,
and another mutation in POLR1C. The second mutation in the sister and
her more severely affected brother, who had previously been studied by
Splendore et al. (2000), was a 4-bp deletion in intron 8 (610060.0002)
at the splice donor site (922+3_922+6del), predicted to result in
skipping of exon 8. The unrelated patient's second mutation was a 979A-T
transversion in exon 9, resulting in a lys327-to-ter (K327X;
610060.0003) substitution. The unrelated patient's unaffected parents
were each heterozygous for 1 of the mutations; the sibs' unaffected
mother and her healthy sister were heterozygous for the R279Q mutation,
but DNA from their deceased father was unavailable for study.

POLR1C gene: a 1-bp deletion (87delT) in exon 2, predicted to cause a
frameshift and a premature termination codon, and an 835C-T transition
in exon 8, resulting in an arg279-to-trp (R279W) substitution
(610060.0005). His unaffected parents were each heterozygous for 1 of

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Aminopeptidases play a role in the metabolism of several peptides that
may be involved in blood pressure and the pathogenesis of essential
hypertension (145500). Adipocyte-derived leucine aminopeptidase (ALAP)
is a member of the M1 family of zinc metallopeptidases.

CLONING

By searching for cDNAs with the potential to encode large proteins
expressed in brain, Nagase et al. (1998) identified a partial cDNA
encoding ERAP1, which they called KIAA0525. The 875-amino acid protein
was predicted to be 44% identical to ALPP (171800) over 428 amino acids.
RT-PCR analysis detected highest expression in placenta, ovary, kidney,
and thymus.

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to ALPP, Hattori et
al. (1999) obtained a full-length cDNA encoding ALAP. The deduced
941-amino acid protein contains an N-terminal signal peptide, 5
potential N-glycosylation sites, a potential membrane-spanning domain,
and a zinc-binding motif. Northern blot analysis revealed expression of
3.6- and 5.1-kb transcripts in all tissues tested except brain, where
only the 5.1-kb mRNA was expressed. An additional 5.6-kb transcript was
expressed in spleen and ovary. Hattori et al. (1999) identified an ALAP
splice variant encoding a protein with 948 residues. Western blot
analysis showed expression of an approximately 100-kD cytoplasmic
protein, close to the predicted size. Functional analysis indicated a
preference for leucine substrates.

By expressing recombinant ALAP in Chinese hamster ovary cells, Hattori
et al. (2000) showed that ALAP is a monomeric protein with a molecular
mass of 120 kD that hydrolyzes a variety of bioactive peptides,
including angiotensin II (see 106150). ALAP was expressed widely in
human tissues, including the cortex of the kidney, where tissue
kallikrein (147910) is localized. The authors suggested that ALAP plays
a role in the regulation of blood pressure through inactivation of
angiotensin II and/or generation of bradykinin (see 113503) in the
kidney.

Schomburg et al. (2000) cloned rat Alap, which they termed
puromycin-insensitive, leucyl-specific aminopeptidase, or Pilsap. Pilsap
is a 930-amino acid protein, and its hydrolytic activity appeared to be
restricted to leucine and, to a lesser extent, methionine.

Serwold et al. (2002) biochemically purified and cloned the 930-amino
acid mouse aminopeptidase, which they termed Eraap. Western blot and
immunofluorescence microscopy showed that the approximately 106-kD
glycosylated protein, which is upregulatable by gamma-interferon (IFNG;
147570), trims N-terminal lysine, leucine, tyrosine, and asparagine
residues when they are not followed by proline in the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) to yield the optimal octamer, primarily, and nonamer
peptides for antigen presentation by major histocompatibility complex
(MHC) molecules. Serwold et al. (2002) concluded that cytoplasmic
proteolysis generates only the C terminus of antigenic peptides. After
transport by TAP (170260), N-terminally extended peptides bind to MHC in
the ER and are then trimmed by Eraap to acquire the optimal length
before export from the ER, explaining why peptides presented by MHC
class I have precise lengths.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Hattori et al. (2001) determined that the
ERAP1 gene contains 20 exons and spans approximately 47 kb. Primer
extension analysis revealed 2 transcriptional initiation sites but no
TATA or CAAT boxes. Luciferase reporter assays revealed a functional
promoter activity in the 5-prime-flanking region of the gene and
suggested that the activity is regulated in a cell type-specific manner.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the ERAP1 gene
to chromosome 5. By genomic sequence analysis, Hattori et al. (2001)
mapped the ERAP1 gene to chromosome 5q15 close to the leucyl-cystinyl
aminopeptidase gene (LNPEP; 151300), suggesting a recent gene
duplication.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis and by coimmunoprecipitation experiments, Cui
et al. (2002) found that human ARTS1 bound to the extracellular domain
of TNFR1 (191190). Overexpression of ARTS1 resulted in increased TNFR1
shedding and decreased membrane-associated TNFR1. Reducing the membrane
levels of ARTS1 by expression of antisense ARTS1 mRNA had the opposite
effect. Recombinant ARTS1 demonstrated selective aminopeptidase activity
toward nonpolar amino acids, but it had no activity against TNFR1 and
was not the TNFR1 sheddase. ARTS1 neither bound to TNFR2 (191191) nor
altered its shedding, suggesting specificity for TNFR1. Cui et al.
(2002) concluded that formation of the TNFR1-ARTS1 molecular complex
represents a novel mechanism by which TNFR1 shedding is regulated.

Saric et al. (2002) and York et al. (2002) determined that purified
ERAP1 trims peptides greater than 10 residues in length, but it spares
and enhances the production of 8-residue peptides generated either in
the ER or cytosol. ERAP1 was also found to trim nearly half of 9-residue
peptides, thereby reducing the supply of antigenic peptides in the
absence of IFNG expression, which induces ERAP1 expression and instead
causes proteasomes to produce more N-terminally extended antigenic
precursors and 9-residue peptides.

Using fractionated ER contents to test for aminopeptidase activity,
Saveanu et al. (2005) found that ERAP1 and ERAP2 (609497) copurified.
Confocal microscopy confirmed colocalization of ERAP1 and ERAP2 in the
ER. Immunoprecipitation experiments suggested that ERAP1 and ERAP2 form
heterodimers. Enzymatic analysis showed that ERAP2 preferentially
hydrolyzed the basic residues arg and lys, whereas ERAP1 acted on leu.
Trimming did not continue after production of minimal nonamer epitopes.
Saveanu et al. (2005) concluded that ERAP1 and ERAP2 function in a
complementary manner on peptides with 9 or more residues.

Using synthetic peptides and natural antigenic precursors, Chang et al.
(2005) showed that ERAP1 preferred substrates of the same lengths (9 to
16 residues) as those transported by TAP. Like most MHC class I
molecules, ERAP1 preferred peptides with hydrophobic C-terminal amino
acids. Chang et al. (2005) concluded that these properties, particularly
its 'molecular ruler' mechanism of binding hydrophobic C termini 9 to 16
residues from the active site, distinguish ERAP1 from other
aminopeptidases. They proposed that ERAP1 evolved to facilitate antigen
presentation.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Hypothesizing that genomic variants of the ALAP gene may be associated
with hypertension or individual variations in blood pressure, Yamamoto
et al. (2002) screened the ALAP gene for mutations in 488 unrelated
Japanese individuals. They identified 33 polymorphisms, including 15
novel polymorphisms. One, lys528 to arg, showed an association with
essential hypertension. The estimated odds ratio for essential
hypertension was 2.3 for presence of the arg allele at codon 528, in
comparison with presence of the lys/lys genotype (P of 0.004). The lys
at codon 528 is conserved in ALAP, LNPEP, rat Pils, and mouse VEGF
(192240)-induced aminopeptidase.

For discussion of a possible association between variation in the ERAP1
gene and ankylosing spondylitis, see SPDA1 (106300).

ANIMAL MODEL

York et al. (2006) generated fertile, healthy mice lacking Erap1. MHC
class I levels were reduced in Erap1 -/- splenocytes, but not
fibroblasts, and peptide trimming in Erap1 -/- fibroblasts was reduced.
The immune response in Erap1 -/- mice to some viral peptides was altered
due to lack of the trimming enzyme.

108360	TITLE *108360 ASIALOGLYCOPROTEIN RECEPTOR 1; ASGR1
;;C-TYPE LECTIN DOMAIN FAMILY 4, MEMBER H1; CLEC4H1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The ASGR1 gene encodes a glycoprotein that forms the asialoglycoprotein
receptor, also known as the Ashwell receptor, which is specific for
desialylated (galactosyl-terminal) glycoproteins and is expressed
exclusively in hepatic parenchymal cells. Partially deglycosylated
plasma glycoproteins are efficiently and specifically removed from the
circulation via this receptor-ligand complex. Many functional studies
describing the kinetics of ligand-binding, internalization, and
recycling of such receptors have been performed on the human hepatoma
cell line HepG2 (Spiess et al., 1985).

See also ASGR2 (108361), which also maps to chromosome 17p.

CLONING

Spiess et al. (1985) isolated a cDNA corresponding to the ASGR1 gene
from a human hepatoma cDNA library. The deduced 291-residue amino acid
protein was highly homologous to the sequence of the major
asialoglycoprotein receptor protein in the rat. There was no significant
posttranslational processing and no leader sequence, cleaved or
uncleaved, at the amino terminus. An internal signal sequence, probably
the membrane-spanning segment (residues 41-59), was assumed to direct
insertion of the carboxyl-terminal ligand-binding portion of the
receptor across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane.

MAPPING

Sanford et al. (1991) mapped the ASGR1 gene to chromosome 17p13-p11 by
analysis of somatic cell hybrids.

Hsieh et al. (1990) demonstrated that the Asgr-1 and Asgr-2 genes are
located on mouse chromosome 11 near Zpf-3 (194480) and Amog (182331) in
a region of mouse chromosome 11 that is homologous to human 17p.

ANIMAL MODEL

Grewal et al. (2008) found that circulating plasma von Willebrand factor
(VWF; 613160) was increased 1.5-fold in mice lacking Asgr1 compared to
mice lacking Asgr2 or wildtype mice, suggesting that the Ashwell
receptor is normally engaged in the control of endogenous vWF clearance
and homeostasis via a receptor-ligand interaction. Asgr1 deficiency also
corrected the prolonged bleeding and thrombocytopenia associated with
St3gal4 (194249) deficiency and disruption of sialyltransferase
function. The findings suggested that ST3GAL4 deficiency exposes
endogenous glycan ligands on platelets that are recognized by the
Ashwell receptor in an interaction that promotes asialo-platelet
clearance by hepatocytes and leads to thrombocytopenia. Wildtype mice
infected with Streptococcus pneumoniae, a pathogen with sialidase
(neuraminidase) activity, showed progressively desialylated platelets
and thrombocytopenia due to increased removal of platelets from the
circulation by the hepatic Ashwell receptor. Asgr1- or Asgr2-deficient
mice who were infected showed decreased survival and signs of severe
disseminated intravascular coagulation compared to infected wildtype
mice, with the outcome worse for Asgr1-deficient mice. Grewal et al.
(2008) concluded that the thrombocytopenia in disseminated intravascular
coagulation results from Ashwell receptor-dependent clearance of
platelets that are first desialylated by the sialidase of the pathogen.
The findings revealed that vWF and platelets are endogenous ligands of
the Ashwell receptor, implying that hepatocytes are involved in the
clearance of these coagulation factors from the circulation, which is an
unexpected biologic activity for this cell type.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Wang et al. (2001) cloned a full-length KLHL5 cDNA from a human fetal
brain cDNA library. The cDNA encodes a deduced 755-amino acid protein
that contains a BTB/POZ domain at the N terminus and 6 tandemly arranged
kelch repeats (kelch domain) at the C terminus. Both the BTB and kelch
domains are conserved in members of the kelch protein family. KLHL5
shares 43% sequence identity with the Drosophila Kelch protein, an
oligomeric ring canal actin organizer. It also shares significant
sequence identity with human KLHL2 (605774) and KLHL3 (605775). Northern
blot analysis revealed a single KLHL5 band with high expression in
ovary, adrenal gland, and thyroid, lower expression in prostate, testis,
spinal cord, lymph node, and trachea, and no expression in any other
tissue examined.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Wang et al. (2001) mapped the KLHL5 gene to
chromosome 4p15.1-p13.

;;KIAA0590
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The IFT140 gene encodes a subunit of intraflagellar transport complex A
(IFTA), which is involved in retrograde ciliary transport (summary by
Perrault et al., 2012).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) cloned IFT140, which they called KIAA0590.
The deduced protein contains 1,462 amino acids. It had an apparent
molecular mass of more than 100 kD by SDS-PAGE. RT-PCR detected high
expression in kidney, moderate expression in ovary, testis, prostate,
and lung, and low expression in thymus, brain, heart, placenta, and
skeletal muscle. Little to no expression was present liver, pancreas,
spleen, and small intestine.

MAPPING

Using radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the IFT140
gene to chromosome 16. Gross (2012) mapped the IFT140 gene to chromosome
16p13.3 based on an alignment of the IFT140 sequence (GenBank GENBANK
BC035577) with the genomic sequence (GRCh37).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 11 patients from 7 unrelated families with Mainzer-Saldino syndrome
(MZSDS; 266920), Perrault et al. (2012) identified homozygous or
compound heterozygous mutations in the IFT140 gene (see, e.g.,
614620.0001-614620.0006). Mutations in the first patient were identified
by ciliome sequencing and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Heterozygous
mutations in the IFT140 gene were found in 4 additional index patients
with the disorder; a second pathogenic mutation was not detected in
these patients. Clinical features of patients with biallelic mutations
did not differ from those with heterozygous mutations. Features were
slightly variable, but included early-onset retinitis pigmentosa with
variable visual loss, chronic renal failure, and skeletal anomalies,
such as phalangeal cone-shaped epiphyses, short stature, and metaphyseal
defects of the hips in some. A minority of patients had hepatic
involvement with cholestasis and fibrosis. Cognition was intact, except
in 2 consanguineous families in which neurologic symptoms may have been
due to other causes. Two patients from 1 family had craniosynostosis,
and 2 unrelated patients had a short thorax with short ribs, reminiscent
of mild Jeune syndrome, or asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy (see, e.g.,
ATD1, 208500). In vitro functional expression studies in retinal pigment
epithelial cells demonstrated that the missense mutant IFT140 proteins
had partial to complete loss of basal body localization and an increase
of cytoplasmic staining. Fibroblasts from 2 unrelated patients showed
absent cilia in a high proportion of cells compared to controls,
indicating a defect in ciliogenesis and/or cilia maintenance. Although
mutant IFT140 was localized along the cilia axoneme, there appeared to
be a defect in retrograde ciliary transport with an abnormal
distribution of other ciliary proteins. The findings indicated that
IFT140 has a pivotal role in proper development and function of ciliated
cells, and confirmed that Mainzer-Saldino syndrome is a skeletal
ciliopathy.

MAINZER-SALDINO SYNDROME
IFT140, GLU664LYS

In a 17-year-old boy with Mainzer-Saldino syndrome (MZSDS; 266920),
Perrault et al. (2012) identified compound heterozygosity for 2
mutations in the IFT140 gene: a 1990G-A transition resulting in a
glu664-to-lys (E664K) substitution in a highly conserved residue, and a
G-to-T transversion in intron 19 (2399+1G-T; 614620.0002), predicted to
result in the skipping of exon 18. The mutations were confirmed by
Sanger sequencing and not identified in 200 control chromosomes. The
mutations were found by ciliome sequencing of the patient's DNA. Five
affected individuals from 2 additional consanguineous Saudi Arabian
families with MZSDS were found to be homozygous for the E664K mutation.
In vitro functional expression studies in retinal pigment epithelial
cells demonstrated that the mutant protein had partial to complete loss
of basal body localization and an increase of cytoplasmic staining,
indicating severe disorganization. Patient fibroblasts showed absent
cilia in a high proportion of cells compared to controls, consistent
with a defect in ciliogenesis and/or cilia maintenance. Although mutant
IFT140 was localized along the cilia axoneme, there appeared to be a
defect in retrograde ciliary transport with an abnormal distribution of
other ciliary proteins. All patients had onset of retinal dystrophy in
infancy with visual loss and nystagmus. All patients had skeletal
anomalies, including short stature in most, phalangeal cone-shaped
epiphyses, and metaphyseal defects in the hips (in 3). The patient who
was compound heterozygous for IFT140 mutations had chronic renal failure
and a small thoracic cavity with short, thick ribs; however, none of the
Saudi Arabian patients had overt renal disease. Four of the 5 Saudi
Arabian patients had mild intellectual disability or autistic features
with seizures, which may have been due to other factors.

IFT140, TYR311CYS

In an 18-year-old boy with Mainzer-Saldino syndrome (266920), Perrault
et al. (2012) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the
IFT140 gene: a 932A-G transition resulting in a tyr311-to-cys (Y311C)
substitution that was predicted to be deleterious, and a 4-bp deletion
(857_860del; 614620.0004), resulting in a frameshift and premature
termination (Ile286LysfsTer6). Neither mutation was found in 200 control
chromosomes. In vitro functional expression studies in retinal pigment
epithelial cells demonstrated that the Y311C mutant protein had partial
to complete loss of basal body localization and an increase of
cytoplasmic staining. Fibroblasts of 1 patient showed absent cilia in a
high proportion of cells compared to controls, indicating a defect in
ciliogenesis and/or cilia maintenance. Although mutant IFT140 was
localized along the cilia axoneme, there appeared to be a defect in
retrograde ciliary transport with an abnormal distribution of other
ciliary proteins. The patient had onset at birth of retinal dystrophy
with visual loss, and nystagmus, phalangeal cone-shaped epiphyses in the
feet, chronic renal failure, and cholestasis. Psychomotor development
was normal.

In 2 affected members of a family with Mainzer-Saldino syndrome

2 mutations in the IFT140 gene: a 634G-A transition resulting in a
gly212-to-arg (G212R) substitution, and a 1-bp duplication (3916dup;
614620.0006), resulting in a frameshift and premature termination
(Ala1306GlyfsTer56). Neither mutation was found in 200 control
chromosomes and both were predicted to be deleterious. In vitro
functional expression studies in retinal pigment epithelial cells
demonstrated that the G212R mutant protein had partial to complete loss
of basal body localization and an increase of cytoplasmic staining. The
patients had early-onset retinitis pigmentosa with poor visual acuity,
chronic renal failure leading to end-stage renal disease, and
cholestasis. The kidneys were hyperechogenic with loss of
corticomedullary differentiation. Both also had skeletal anomalies,
including short stature, craniosynostosis, and phalangeal cone-shaped
epiphyses. Psychomotor development was normal at ages 4 and 10 years,
respectively.

600135	TITLE *600135 CORTEXIN 1; CTXN1
;;CTXN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Cortexin is an 82-amino acid protein that is highly enriched in
precursor neurons of the cortical plate of fetal rodent brain and in
pyramidal neurons of adult rodent cerebral cortex and hippocampus
(Watson et al., 1992; Coulter et al., 1993). Because of a putative
single membrane-spanning domain in the middle of the cortexin amino acid
sequence, cortexin is likely to be an integral membrane protein that may
mediate extracellular or intracellular signaling of cortical neurons
during forebrain development (Watson et al., 1994).

MAPPING

By linkage analysis of RFLVs in interspecific backcrosses, the Ctxn gene
was mapped to mouse chromosome 8 (Watson et al., 1994).

612191	TITLE *612191 MICROSEMINOPROTEIN, PROSTATE-ASSOCIATED; MSMP
;;PC3 PROSTATE CANCER CELL-SECRETED MICROPROTEIN; PSMP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching databases for homologs of mouse Psmp, followed by 3-prime
and 5-prime RACE of total RNA from PC3 human prostate cancer cells,
Valtonen-Andre et al. (2007) cloned PSMP. The deduced protein contains
139 amino acids, including an N-terminal signal peptide. The mature
103-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 11.1 kD and
shares 23% identity with human beta-microseminoprotein (MSMB; 157145).
PSMP is highly conserved, sharing 91 to 94% amino acid identity with its
rodent and dog homologs. RT-PCR of 27 human tissues detected PSMP
expression only in trachea and, to a lesser extent, testis. PSMP was
highly expressed in PC3 cells, but not in 2 other prostate cancer cell
lines. Western blot analysis revealed an 18-kD PSMP protein in culture
medium conditioned by PC3 cells. Lysates of PC3 cells also contained a
16-kD PSMP protein, suggesting that PSMP undergoes posttranslational
modification prior to secretion. Immunohistochemical analysis and in
situ hybridization showed strong expression of PSMP mRNA and protein in
xenografted PC3 tumors from athymic nude mice. Immunohistochemical
analysis of human prostate cancer specimens showed PSMP expression in
the cytoplasm of both benign and malignant epithelial cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Valtonen-Andre et al. (2007) determined that the PSMP gene contains 3
exons and spans 1.3 kb. It has a putative TATA box at its 5-prime end.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Valtonen-Andre et al. (2007) mapped the
MSMP gene to chromosome 9p13.3, close to the GBA2 gene (609471). They
mapped the mouse Msmp (Psmp) gene to chromosome 4B1.

607281	TITLE *607281 LSM1 PROTEIN; LSM1
;;CANCER-ASSOCIATED SM-LIKE PROTEIN; CASM
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Sm-like proteins, such as LSM1, were identified in a variety of
organisms based on sequence homology with the Sm protein family (see
SNRPD2; 601061). Sm-like proteins contain the Sm sequence motif, which
consists of 2 regions separated by a linker of variable length that
folds as a loop. Sm-like proteins are thought to form a stable heteromer
present in tri-snRNP particles, which are important for pre-mRNA
splicing (Achsel et al., 1999). LSM1 localizes to cytoplasmic processing
bodies (P bodies) involved in mRNA storage, processing, regulation, and
degradation and is required for P-body formation (Scheller et al.,
2007).

CLONING

LSM1 was first isolated from human pancreatic cancers as an upregulated
gene and termed 'cancer-associated Sm-like protein' (CASM) by
Schweinfest et al. (1997). The deduced LSM1 protein contains 133 amino
acids.

In a search for human Sm-like proteins, Achsel et al. (1999)
fractionated proteins present in purified (U4/U6.U5) tri-snRNPs and
isolated 7 Sm-like proteins, which they named LSm2-LSm8. Using partial
peptide sequence for database searches, they identified and sequenced
EST clones. Using additional sequence obtained by PCR amplification of a
HeLa cDNA library, they assembled full-length cDNA sequences for
LSM2-LSM8.

Salgado-Garrido et al. (1999) searched database sequence for Sm proteins
and identified 16 potential Sm-related genes in yeast as well as some
Sm-related genes in human and archaebacteria. Using a multiple sequence
alignment of Sm domains, they built a phylogenetic tree of yeast, human,
and archaeal Sm and Sm-like proteins.

Using Northern blot analysis, Scheller et al. (2007) detected variable
expression of a 0.95-kb LSM1 transcript in all human tissues examined.
In HeLa cells, LSM1 colocalized with PATL1 (614660), DCP1 (see 607010),
and RCK (DDX6; 600326) in cytoplasmic P bodies.

GENE FUNCTION

Using electron-microscopy, Achsel et al. (1999) observed that purified
LSm proteins form a heteromer that is stable even in the absence of RNA
and exhibits a doughnut-shaped structure similar to the Sm core RNP
structure. They demonstrated that the purified LSm heteromer binds
specifically to the U6 snRNA at its 3-prime-terminal U-tract. They also
showed that the LSm proteins facilitate the formation of U4/U6 RNA
duplexes in vitro and concluded that the LSm proteins may play a role in
U4/U6 snRNP formation.

Using immunoprecipitation experiments, Salgado-Garrido et al. (1999)
concluded that there is a complex of 7 Sm-like proteins bound to RNA in
yeast. Lsm2-Lsm8 coprecipitate the U4, U5 and U6 snRNAs and directly
associate with the U6 snRNA present in the free U6 snRNP. Additionally,
the yeast Lsm2-Lsm7 proteins were found to be associated with the
pre-RNase P RNA but not the mature RNase RNA. Using immunoprecipitation
experiments from human cell extracts, Salgado-Garrido et al. (1999)
showed that the LSM3 and LSM4 proteins are specifically associated with
snRNP complexes containing the U6 snRNA. Salgado-Garrido et al. (1999)
concluded that Sm and Sm-like proteins assemble in at least 2
functionally conserved complexes of deep evolutionary origin.

By disrupting the Sm and Sm-like genes in yeast, Salgado-Garrido et al.
(1999) concluded that disruption of genes encoding Sm-like proteins
directly associated with the U6 snRNA (Lsm2-8) generated variable
phenotypes. Lsm2, Lsm3, Lsm4, and Lsm8 are essential for vegetative
growth. Lsm5, Lsm6, and Lsm7 are not essential for growth; however,
their disruptions lead to slow growth especially at elevated
temperature. The levels of the U6 snRNA were strongly reduced in the
strains harboring the Lsm5, Lsm6, and Lsm7 disruptions. Lsm1 and Lsm9
are dispensable for vegetative growth, but Lsm1 is required for optimal
vegetative growth at 30 degrees and is temperature sensitive.

Ingelfinger et al. (2002) determined that human LSM1 to LSM7, but not
LSM8, were expressed in HeLa cells within cytoplasmic foci. The foci
also contained a decapping enzyme (DCP1/2) and the exonuclease XRN1
(607994). Coexpression of wildtype and mutant LSM proteins, as well as
fluorescence resonance energy transfer, indicated that the LSM proteins
form a complex similar to one found in yeast. Ingelfinger et al. (2002)
concluded that the foci contain a partially or fully assembled machinery
for the degradation of mRNA.

Using cDNA-representational difference analysis, Takahashi et al. (2002)
searched for genes differentially expressed in advanced prostate cancers
and thereby isolated the LSM1 gene as 1 that is downregulated. They
transfected an LSM1 expression vector into PC3 cells, which normally
feature downregulated LSM1. In the transfectants, no differences in
morphology or cell proliferation were evident in comparison with parent
PC3 or PC3/mock-transfectants. In contrast, significant suppression of
invasive potential or metastatic ability of LSM1 transfectants was
observed in the Matrigel chemoinvasion assay and in nude mice,
respectively. In studies of human prostate cancers, Takahashi et al.
(2002) found that almost all informative prostatectomized cases without
neoadjuvant therapy showed allelic retention in the LSM1 region, whereas
refractory cancers frequently showed allelic loss in this region. No
critical gene mutations were found in the open reading frame of LSM1 in
prostate cancers, including localized and refractory cancers. These
results suggested that LSM1 is deeply involved in prostate cancer
progression through its downregulation, independent of any gene
mutation.

By array CGH, Yang et al. (2006) analyzed the copy number and expression
level of genes in the 8p12-p11 amplicon in 22 human breast cancer
(114480) specimens and 7 breast cancer cell lines. Of the 21 potential
genes identified, PCR analysis and functional analysis indicated that 3
genes, LSM1, BAG4 (603884), and C8ORF4 (607702), are breast cancer
oncogenes that can work in combination to influence a transformed
phenotype in human mammary epithelial cells.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the LSM1
gene to chromosome 8 (TMAP stSG26021). Most of the genes encoding the
Lsm proteins map to different chromosomes.

186591	TITLE *186591 SYNTAXIN 4; STX4
;;STX4A;;
SYNTAXIN, PLACENTAL;;
p35-2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Li et al. (1994) described the nucleotide sequence of STX4A, a syntaxin
gene isolated from a placenta library. (The gene was previously
symbolized STX2.) It encodes a predicted 297-amino acid protein that is
89% identical to the amino acid sequence of rat Stx4a.

By immunohistochemical analysis of rat brain sections, Kennedy et al.
(2010) showed that Stx4 was expressed throughout brain. In rat
hippocampal neurons, Stx4 showed a punctate distribution in the
somatodendritic compartment, and Stx4 clusters often localized to
dendritic spines. Immunogold electron microscopy of CA1 rat hippocampus
revealed frequent Stx4 labeling near spine membranes at sites lateral to
postsynaptic densities, with occasional labeling of presynaptic
membranes. Biochemical fractionation of mouse brain revealed Stx4 in
synaptosome fractions, but not in synaptic vesicle fractions.

GENE FUNCTION

Mandon et al. (1996) stated that vesicle-associated membrane proteins
(VAMPs) or synaptobrevins (see 185880) are proposed to bind to cognate
vesicle-targeting receptors in target membranes, which include several
members of the syntaxin family. The molecular mechanisms responsible for
targeting of vesicles containing aquaporin-2 (AQP2; 107777) to the
apical plasma membrane of renal collecting duct cells may involve the
vesicle-targeting protein STX4. Among the known syntaxin isoforms, only
STX1 (STX1A; 186590) and STX4 bind VAMP2 (185881) with high affinity.
Thus, STX1 and STX4 could be considered candidates for a role in
targeting of the AQP2/VAMP2-containing vesicles to the apical plasma
membrane in collecting duct cells. In contrast to STX1, which is
expressed predominantly in the central nervous system, STX4 is expressed
in a variety of tissues including the kidney. Mandon et al. (1996) used
sequence data for rat Stx1a, Stx1b (601485), and Stx4 from Bennett et
al. (1993) to design PCR primers for RT-PCR analysis of rat tissues.
They detected Stx4 mRNA in the apical plasma membrane of collecting duct
principal cells. They also demonstrated in the rat kidney the presence
of a protein with the characteristics of Stx4 in the apical plasma
membrane of inner medullary-collecting duct cells.

To clarify the physiologic function of STXBP3 (608339) in
insulin-stimulated GLUT4 (SLC2A4; 138190) exocytosis, Kanda et al.
(2005) generated mouse embryos deficient in the Stx4-binding protein
Stxbp3 and developed Stxbp3 -/- adipocytes from their mesenchymal
fibroblasts. The insulin-induced appearance of Glut4 at the cell surface
was enhanced in Stxbp3 -/- adipocytes compared to +/+ cells. Wortmannin,
an inhibitor of PI3K, inhibited insulin-stimulated Glut4 externalization
in +/+ but not -/- adipocytes. Kanda et al. (2005) suggested that
disruption of the interaction between STX4 and STXBP3 in adipocytes
might result in enhancement of insulin-stimulated GLUT4 externalization.

Using RT-PCR, immunoblot analysis, and immunofluorescence microscopy,
Sander et al. (2008) demonstrated that human intestinal mast cells (MCs)
expressed SNAP23 (602534), STX1B, STX2 (132350), STX3 (STX3A; 600876),
STX4, and STX6 (603944), but not SNAP25 (600322). MCs also expressed
VAMP3 (603657), VAMP7 (300053), and VAMP8 (603177), but, in contrast
with rodent MCs, they expressed only low levels of VAMP2 (185881). VAMP7
and VAMP8 translocated to the plasma membrane and interacted with SNAP23
and STX4 upon activation. Inhibition of STX4, SNAP23, VAMP7, or VAMP8,
but not VAMP2 or VAMP3, resulted in markedly reduced high-affinity IgE
receptor-mediated histamine release. Sander et al. (2008) concluded that
human MCs express a specific pattern of SNAREs and that VAMP7 and VAMP8,
but not VAMP2, are required for rapid degranulation.

Using rat hippocampal neurons, Kennedy et al. (2010) showed that
exocytosis of recycling endosomes at dendritic spines occurred at
Stx4-enriched sites immediately lateral to postsynaptic densities.
Disruption of Stx4 either acutely or chronically blocked membrane fusion
and cargo delivery triggered by synaptic activation, and acute
inhibition of Stx4 abolished long-term potentiation. Kennedy et al.
(2010) concluded that STX4 is a central component of the SNARE machinery
that mediates rapid, activity-dependent fusion of recycling endosomes in
dendritic spines.

603346	TITLE *603346 NEURONAL PAS DOMAIN PROTEIN 1; NPAS1
;;MEMBER OF PAS SUPERFAMILY 5; MOP5
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

NPAS1 is a member of the basic helix-loop-helix/Per-Arnt-Sim (bHLH-PAS)
family of transcription factors. It is selectively expressed in the
central nervous system (Zhou et al., 1997).

CLONING

By searching an EST database, Zhou et al. (1997) identified human and
mouse cDNAs encoding 2 novel bHLH-PAS proteins, NPAS1 and NPAS2
(603347). The predicted 590-amino acid human NPAS1 protein shares 86%
sequence identity with mouse Npas1. Northern blot analysis of mouse
tissues revealed that Npas1 is expressed predominantly in brain. In situ
hybridization indicated that the pattern of Npas1 mRNA distribution in
mouse brain is broad and complex, and is largely nonoverlapping with
that of Npas2. Hogenesch et al. (1997) identified NPAS1 as MOP5 (member
of the PAS superfamily 5).

MAPPING

By analysis of somatic cell and radiation hybrid panels, Zhou et al.
(1997) mapped the NPAS1 gene to human chromosome 19q13.2-q13.3. Using an
interspecific backcross, they mapped the mouse Npas1 gene to a region of
chromosome 7 showing homology of synteny with human 19q13.2-q13.3.

603356	TITLE *603356 CD164 ANTIGEN; CD164
;;SIALOMUCIN CD164;;
ENDOLYN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Sialomucins are a heterogeneous group of secreted or membrane-associated
mucins that appear to play 2 key but opposing roles in vivo: first as
cytoprotective or antiadhesive agents, and second as adhesion receptors.
CD164 is a type I integral transmembrane sialomucin that functions as an
adhesion receptor (Watt et al., 1998; Forde et al., 2007).

CLONING

Using 2 monoclonal antibodies and a retroviral expression cloning
strategy, Zannettino et al. (1998) isolated a cDNA encoding a novel
transmembrane isoform of the mucin-like glycoprotein MGC24, which they
designated CD164. The mature CD164 protein contains 178 amino acids, has
a molecular mass of 80 to 90 kD, and is extremely rich in serine and
threonine. CD164 was expressed by human CD34 (142230)-positive
hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs).

GENE FUNCTION

Zannettino et al. (1998) found that the CD164 receptor appeared to play
a role in hematopoiesis by facilitating adhesion of CD34-positive cells
to bone marrow stroma and by negatively regulating CD34-positive HPC
growth. These functional effects were mediated by at least 2 spatially
distinct epitopes, defined by specific monoclonal antibodies. Watt et
al. (1998) found that these and other CD164 monoclonal antibodies showed
distinct patterns of reactivity when analyzed on hematopoietic cells
from normal human bone marrow, umbilical cord blood, and peripheral
blood. Expression of the CD164 epitope was found on developing
myelomonocytic cells in bone marrow, being downregulated on mature
neutrophils but maintained on monocytes in the peripheral blood.

Using CD133 (PROM1; 604365)-positive HPCs and a T-cell line, Forde et
al. (2007) demonstrated that CD164 associated with CXCR4 (162643).
Antibody to the CD164 N-linked glycan-dependent epitope or CD164
knockdown via small interfering RNA inhibited migration of
CD133-positive HPCs toward CXCL12 (600835), the CXCR4 ligand. CXCL12, in
association with fibronectin (FN1; 135600), induced association of CD164
with CXCR4 following association of CXCR4 with the fibronectin receptors
VLA4 (see ITGA4; 192975) and VLA5 (see ITGA5; 135620). CD164-CXCR4
association coincided with PKC-zeta (PRKCZ; 176982) and AKT (164730)
signaling through CXCR4. Forde et al. (2007) concluded that an
association among 3 distinct families of cell surface receptors,
including CD164, regulates cell migratory responses and probably lends
specificity to the homing and lodging of these cells within bone marrow.

MAPPING

Watt et al. (1998) identified PAC clones containing the CD164 gene and
used these clones to localize the CD164 gene to chromosome 6q21 by FISH.

608321	TITLE *608321 TIR DOMAIN-CONTAINING ADAPTOR MOLECULE 2; TICAM2
;;TOLL/INTERLEUKIN-1 RECEPTOR DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN; TIRP;;
TRIF-RELATED ADAPTOR MOLECULE; TRAM
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TIRP is a Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (IL1R; 147810) (TIR)
domain-containing adaptor protein involved in Toll receptor signaling
(see TLR4; 603030).

CLONING

By searching an EST database for TIR domain-containing proteins, Bin et
al. (2003) identified a cDNA encoding TIRP. The predicted 235-amino acid
protein, which is 70% identical to the mouse protein, has a central TIR
domain that is most similar to that of TRIF (607601). Northern blot
analysis indicated that TIRP is expressed ubiquitously. Transcripts of
3.8, 3.6, and 2.0 kb were detected, and they were differentially
expressed in tissues. Independently, Fitzgerald et al. (2003) also
cloned TIRP, which they called TRAM.

GENE FUNCTION

By coimmunoprecipitation analysis, Bin et al. (2003) found that TIRP
interacted with IL1R1, IL1RAP (602626), TIRAP (606252), and TRIF, but
not with MYD88 (602170), TLR2 (603028), or TLR4. Among IRAKs, TIRP
interacted with wildtype IRAK2 (603034) and IRAKM (IRAK3; 604459), both
of which lack kinase activity, but it interacted only with
kinase-inactive mutants of IRAK1 (300283) and IRAK4 (606883). Analysis
of deletion mutants determined that the TIR domain of TIRP interacted
specifically with the TRAF domain of TRAF6 (602355); TIRP did not
interact with TRAF5 (602356). Reporter gene analysis indicated that TIRP
weakly activated nuclear factor kappa-B (NFKB; see 164011) through IL1R1
or IL1RAP, and it could be inhibited by dominant-negative mutants of
IRAK1, IRAK2, TRAF6, and IKKB (IKBKB; 603258).

Using small interfering RNA studies, Fitzgerald et al. (2003) determined
that, like TRIF, TRAM interacts with and activates IRF3 (603734).
However, it does so only through the TLR4 pathway, not the TLR3 (603029)
pathway, and in a TRIF-dependent manner.

McGettrick et al. (2006) found that TRAM was phosphorylated by protein
kinase C-epsilon (PRKCE; 176975) after stimulation of monocytic cells
with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Mutation of ser6 or ser16 of TRAM to
alanine blocked phosphorylation, whereas mutation of ser10 or ser14 had
no effect. TRAM phosphorylation by PRKCE resulted in reduced membrane
expression of TRAM and activation of NFKB in human embryonic kidney
cells. Murine embryonic fibroblasts lacking Prkce exhibited a disruption
of Tram-dependent pathways for activation of Irf3 and induction of Ccl5
(187011). TRAM containing a ser16-to-ala mutation was unable to fully
reconstitute signaling in Tram-deficient murine embryonic fibroblasts.
McGettrick et al. (2006) concluded that TRAM is a key target of PRKCE in
the LPS-TLR4 signaling pathway.

MAPPING

Fitzgerald et al. (2003) stated that the TRAM gene maps to chromosome 5.

ANIMAL MODEL

Yamamoto et al. (2003) generated Tram-deficient mice, which showed
defects in cytokine production, notably production of IFNB (147640), in
response to TLR4, but not other TLR ligands. Studies of Tram-deficient
embryonic fibroblasts indicated that Tram is not involved in IL1R
signaling. Yamamoto et al. (2003) concluded that TRAM provides
specificity for MYD88-independent TLR4 signaling.

607456	TITLE *607456 CIRHIN; CIRH1A
;;TESTIS-EXPRESSED GENE 292; TEX292;;
KIAA1988;;
UTP4
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Lopez-Fernandez and del Mazo (1996) cloned mouse Tex292 from a testis
cDNA library by subtractive hybridization. Northern blot analysis
detected a 2.3-kb transcript expressed in adult mouse testis and in
somatic tissues. Expression increased during neonatal testis
development.

By randomly sequencing clones derived from a fetal brain cDNA library,
Nagase et al. (2001) cloned TEX292, which they designated KIAA1988. The
deduced 362-amino acid protein contains a WD domain/G-beta repeat,
suggesting that it functions in cell signaling. RT-PCR followed by ELISA
detected moderate to high expression in all tissues and brain regions
examined, with highest expression in adult and fetal liver.

Chagnon et al. (2002) determined that the TEX292 protein, which they
called cirhin, has 686 amino acids.

GENE STRUCTURE

Chagnon et al. (2002) determined that the CIRH1A gene has 17 exons and
spans 36.3 kb of genomic sequence.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis of a human liver cDNA library, Freed et al.
(2012) found that cirhin interacted with the nucleolar protein NOL11
(615366). Affinity purification followed by mass spectrometric analysis
confirmed this interaction in HEK293 cells. Knockdown of NOL11 or cirhin
in HeLa cells led to defective pre-rRNA processing and caused formation
of an abnormal single, large nucleolus. Knockdown of NOL11, but not
cirhin, also reduced pre-rRNA transcription by polymerase I (see POLR1B;
602000).

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Nagase et al. (2001) mapped the TEX292
gene to chromosome 16. By genomic sequence analysis, Chagnon et al.
(2002) mapped the CIRH1A gene to chromosome 16q22, where it is flanked
by the SNTB2 gene (600027) at 16q22-q23 and by the HAS3 gene (602428) at
16q22.1.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

North American Indian childhood cirrhosis (NAIC; 604901) is a severe
autosomal recessive intrahepatic cholestasis described in Ojibway-Cree
children from northwestern Quebec. It typically presents with transient
neonatal jaundice in a child who is otherwise healthy and progresses to
biliary cirrhosis and portal hypertension. Liver transplantation has
been the only effective therapy for patients with advanced disease. By
screening genes located within the NAIC critical region on chromosome
16q22, Chagnon et al. (2002) identified a missense mutation in the
cirhin gene that caused NAIC. The mutation was located in exon 15 and
resulted in an arg565-to-trp substitution (607456.0001).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
NORTH AMERICAN INDIAN CHILDHOOD CIRRHOSIS
CIRH1A, ARG565TRP

In all patients from 5 families with North American Indian childhood
cirrhosis (604901), Chagnon et al. (2002) identified homozygosity for a
C-to-T transition at nucleotide 1741 in exon 15 of the CIRH1A gene,
resulting in an arg565-to-trp (R565W) substitution. This substitution
was predicted to alter the secondary structure of the protein.

Freed et al. (2012) presented evidence that the R565W mutation cirhin
causes a partial loss of interaction between cirhin and NOL11 (615366).

609833	TITLE *609833 SOLUTE CARRIER FAMILY 47, MEMBER 2; SLC47A2
;;MULTIDRUG AND TOXIN EXTRUSION PROTEIN 2; MATE2;;
MATE2K
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MATE2 belongs to a family of transporters that excrete endogenous and
exogenous toxic electrolytes through urine and bile (Otsuka et al.,
2005).

CLONING

By searching for genes similar to bacterial MATE-type multidrug
transporters, followed by RT-PCR of human brain RNA, Otsuka et al.
(2005) cloned MATE2. The deduced 602-amino acid protein contains 12
transmembrane domains and has cytoplasmic N and C termini. Northern blot
analysis detected a 3.2-kb MATE2 transcript in kidney only. Mouse Mate2
was expressed specifically in testis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kajiwara et al. (2009) reported that the SLC47A2 gene contains 17 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Otsuka et al. (2005) mapped the MATE2 gene
to chromosome 17p11.2, near the MATE1 gene (SLC47A1; 609832) on the
opposite strand. They mapped the mouse Mate1 and Mate2 genes to
chromosome 11.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Kajiwara et al. (2009) identified several nonsynonymous SNPs in the
MATE1 (SLC47A1; 609832) and MATE2K genes in 89 Japanese individuals.
Most of the changes resulted in transporters that exhibited reduced
uptake of radiolabeled tetraethylammonium or metformin when expressed in
HEK293 cells compared with the wildtype transporter. A 632GC-TT change
(dbSNP ss104806862) in exon 8 of the MATE2K gene had an allelic
frequency of 1.7% and resulted in a gly211-to-val (G211V) substitution
near transmembrane domain-6 of the protein. This substitution abolished
MATE2K transport activity following expression in HEK293 cells. Cell
surface biotinylation followed by Western blot analysis revealed that
expression of MATE2K G211V at the cell surface was about 1% of that
shown by wildtype MATE2K.

608919	TITLE *608919 TWEETY, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, 3; TTYH3
;;KIAA1691
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned TTYH3, which they designated
KIAA1691. RT-PCR ELISA detected moderate expression in most adult and
fetal tissues and specific brain regions examined, with somewhat lower
expression in skeletal muscle and pancreas.

By searching databases for proteins with 4 or more transmembrane
segments, Suzuki and Mizuno (2004) identified TTYH3. The deduced
523-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 58 kD. TTYH3
has 6 transmembrane domains and a glutamate and aspartate-rich Ca(2+)
bowl-like sequence. Northern blot analysis detected a 4.8-kb transcript
in brain, heart, skeletal muscle, colon, spleen, kidney, and peripheral
blood leukocytes. RT-PCR also found expression in mouse fat, pancreas,
thymus, and uterus, and in several mammalian endothelial, kidney
epithelial, and neuronal cell lines. Immunohistochemical analysis of
mouse tissues detected Ttyh3 in thalamic neurons, heart ventricular
cells, skeletal muscle membrane, and renal glomerular mesangium cells.
TTYH3 expressed in transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells was
sensitive to N-glycanase treatment.

GENE FUNCTION

Suzuki and Mizuno (2004) determined that TTYH3 was associated with a
large-conductance chloride current in transfected CHO cells. The current
was completely inhibited by the addition of an anion permeability
inhibitor. Addition of a Ca(2+) ionophore induced an outward-rectified
current in mock-transfected cells, but it introduced an overt linear
current in TTYH3-transfected cells. Channel opening involved a
multiopening mechanism, likely with 2 kinetic states. High cytosolic
Ca(2+) concentration was essential for TTYH3 activation. Based on their
analysis of the 3 TTYH channels, Suzuki and Mizuno (2004) concluded that
the tweety gene family encodes large-conductance chloride channels, and
that TTYH3 may play a role in Ca(2+) signal transduction.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Suzuki and Mizuno (2004) mapped the TTYH3
gene to chromosome 7p22.3.

605020	TITLE *605020 VISUAL SYSTEM HOMEOBOX GENE 1, ZEBRAFISH, HOMOLOG OF; VSX1
;;RETINAL INNER NUCLEAR LAYER HOMEOBOX; RINX
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Homeodomain transcription factors control cell fates during the
development of all animals. The 'paired-like' subfamily of homeodomain
proteins has been implicated in craniofacial and ocular development.
This family is characterized by a homeodomain that is related to the
homeodomain of the Drosophila 'paired' protein.

CLONING

By PCR of a human embryonic craniofacial cDNA library using degenerate
oligonucleotides based on highly conserved motifs within the paired-like
homeodomain, Semina et al. (2000) isolated a cDNA encoding VSX1. The
predicted 365-amino acid VSX1 protein contains a paired-like homeodomain
and a CVC domain. Human VSX1 shares 55% overall sequence identity with
the zebrafish and goldfish Vsx1 proteins and 35% overall identity with
the goldfish Vsx2 (CHX10; 142993) and mouse Chx10 proteins. PCR of a
panel of cDNA libraries detected VSX1 expression in embryonic
craniofacial, adult retina, and adult cornea libraries but not in adult
lens, embryonic or adult brain, heart, kidney, liver, lung, skeletal
muscle, spleen, or thymus libraries.

Using a yeast 1-hybrid screen of an adult bovine retinal cDNA library
with the conserved core of the red/green visual pigment locus control
region (see CBD; 303800) as bait, followed by RT-PCR of a human retinal
library, Hayashi et al. (2000) isolated a cDNA encoding VSX1, which they
termed RINX for 'retinal inner nuclear layer (INL) homeobox.' Hayashi et
al. (2000) also identified 5 splice variants of VSX1. RT-PCR analysis
indicated that the 2 major VSX1 transcripts are expressed in retina and
WERI, a retinoblastoma cell line expressing retinal cone genes, but not
in other tissues or in a rhodopsin-expressing retinoblastoma cell line.
Northern blot analysis detected a 2.0-kb main VSX1 transcript in retina
but not heart. In situ hybridization analysis of bovine retinal sections
demonstrated exclusive localization of VSX1 to cell nuclei in the middle
of the INL, likely belonging to bipolar cells.

Ohtoshi et al. (2001) cloned mouse Vsx1 by PCR of day 7.5 mouse embryo
cDNA using degenerate primers for paired-like homeobox genes. Mouse Vsx1
consists of 363 amino acid residues and contains a homeodomain and a CVC
domain. PCR detected expression of Vsx1 at very low levels during all
stages of embryogenesis. In adult retinal sections, Vsx1 was detected in
the outer half of the inner nuclear layer.

GENE STRUCTURE

The VSX1 gene spans approximately 6.2 kb and contains 5 exons (Semina et
al., 2000; Hayashi et al., 2000). Ohtoshi et al. (2001) determined that
the exon-intron structure of the human and mouse VSX1 genes is
completely conserved.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid mapping, Semina et al. (2000) mapped the VSX1 gene
to 20p11-q11. Hayashi et al. (2000) mapped the VSX1 gene to 20p11.2 by
radiation hybrid analysis.

Ohtoshi et al. (2001) mapped the mouse Vsx1 gene to the distal region of
chromosome 2.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Heon et al. (2002) identified mutations in the VSX1 homeobox gene for 2
distinct inherited human corneal dystrophies: posterior polymorphous
corneal dystrophy (PPCD1; 122000) and keratoconus (148300). One of the
mutations (R166W; 605020.0001) responsible for keratoconus altered the
homeodomain and impaired DNA binding. Two other sequence changes (L159M,
605020.0003 and G160D, 605020.0002) were associated with keratoconus and
PPCD1, respectively, and involved a region adjacent to the homeodomain.
The G160D substitution, and a fourth mutation (P247R; see 605020.0002)
affecting the highly conserved CVC domain, occurred in a child with very
severe PPCD1 who required a corneal transplant at 3 months of age. In
this family, relatives with the G160D change alone had mild to moderate
PPCD1, while P247R alone caused no corneal abnormalities. However, with
either mutation, electroretinography detected abnormal function of the
inner retina, where VSX1 is expressed.

Bisceglia et al. (2005) analyzed the VSX1 gene in 80 Italian patients
with keratoconus. They found 3 previously described missense changes
(see, e.g., 605020.0002) and a novel missense mutation (L17P;
605020.0005) in 7 (8.7%) of the 80 unrelated patients; they also found 2
previously undescribed intronic polymorphisms. The authors concluded
that the VSX1 gene plays an important role in a significant proportion
of autosomal dominant keratoconus cases.

In a case-control panel of 77 sporadic keratoconus patients and 71
controls and a keratoconus family panel involving 444 individuals from
75 families, Tang et al. (2008) screened for 3 keratoconus-associated
VSX1 mutations, L159M, R166W, and H244R. The R166W and H244R variants
were not found in the case-control panel, and L159M was detected in
heterozygosity in 1 control. In the family panel, R166W was not found;
L159M was detected in 3 affected and 2 unaffected individuals, and H244R
was detected in 2 affected and 1 unaffected individual. Tang et al.
(2008) concluded that their results did not support a role for variation
in the VSX1 gene in the pathogenesis of keratoconus.

Dash et al. (2010) analyzed the entire coding region, intron-exon
junctions, and 5- and 3-prime UTR of the VSX1 gene in 66 unrelated
patients with keratoconus, including 27 familial cases and 39 sporadic
cases. The G160D change (605020.0002), previously detected in a family
with PPCD1 and a family with keratoconus, was identified in 2 sporadic
keratoconus patients and was not found in controls; however, other
variants that were found did not segregate with disease and/or did not
demonstrate pathogenicity. Dash et al. (2010) concluded that VSX1 plays
a minor role in keratoconus pathogenesis.

Stabuc-Silih et al. (2010) analyzed the coding regions and intron-exon
junctions of the VSX1 gene in 113 unrelated Slovenian patients with
keratoconus, but identified no disease-causing mutations; they concluded
that other genetic factors are involved in the development of
keratoconus.

De Bonis et al. (2011) analyzed the VSX1 gene in 222 unrelated Italian
probands with keratoconus and reviewed previously published results. De
Bonis et al. (2011) found 1 novel and 3 previously identified VSX1
missense variants in 6 keratoconus patients, respectively (see, e.g.,
605020.0002 and 605020.0005), none of which had been found in controls.
They concluded that VSX1 has a possible pathogenic role in keratoconus,
although in a small number of patients.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
KERATOCONUS 1
VSX1, ARG166TRP

In an isolated patient with keratoconus-1 (148300), Heon et al. (2002)
reported heterozygosity for a missense mutation predicted to result in
an arg166-to-trp (R166W) substitution in the homeodomain of VSX1.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed decreased DNA binding by
the mutant protein.

.0002
CORNEAL DYSTROPHY, POSTERIOR POLYMORPHOUS, 1
KERATOCONUS 1, INCLUDED
VSX1, GLY160ASP

Heon et al. (2002) reported 4 sibs with moderate presentation of
posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy (PPCD1; 122000) who were
heterozygous for a missense mutation in the VSX1 gene. The mutation
resulted in a gly160-to-asp (G160D) substitution. An offspring of one
sib manifested severe PPCD1, and was found to have also inherited a
pro247-to-arg (P247R) mutation in the CVC domain of VSX1 from her
asymptomatic father. Neither mutation was found in over 200 control
individuals.

In a 27-year-old Italian woman who had bilateral keratoconus (KTCN1;
148300), Bisceglia et al. (2005) identified heterozygosity for the G160D
allele. The variant was also present in her affected father and brother,
but was absent from 2 other brothers who had suspected keratoconus by
videokeratographic examination.

Dash et al. (2010) identified the G160D change in 2 sporadic patients
with keratoconus; the variant was not found in 100 controls. Noting that
the G160 residue is not well conserved across species and that G160D is
predicted to be a benign change using the PolyPhen algorithm, Dash et
al. (2010) suggested that the G160D change might represent a rare
polymorphism or genetic modifier.

De Bonis et al. (2011) detected the G160D allele in a sporadic Italian
patient with keratoconus; the variant was not found in 200 controls.

.0003
RECLASSIFIED - VARIANT OF UNKNOWN SIGNIFICANCE
VSX1, LEU159MET

This variant, formerly titled KERATOCONUS 1, has been reclassified based
on the findings of Tang et al. (2008) and De Bonis et al. (2011).

In a 2-generation family with keratoconus-1 (148300), Heon et al. (2002)
identified heterozygosity for a leu159-to-met (L159M) mutation near the
nuclear localization signal of the VSX1 gene in affected individuals.
The authors speculated that the mutation may interfere with the binding
of Ubc9 (601661), which is required for nuclear localization.

Tang et al. (2008) detected heterozygosity for the L159M variant in 3
affected and 2 unaffected individuals from a family panel as well as in
1 control from a sporadic case-control panel, and concluded that the
L159M variant does not play a role in the pathogenesis of keratoconus.

After reviewing published studies, De Bonis et al. (2011) stated that
the L159M variant may be considered to be a polymorphism without
pathogenic significance.

.0004
CRANIOFACIAL ANOMALIES AND ANTERIOR SEGMENT DYSGENESIS SYNDROME
VSX1, ALA256SER

In an African American family with abnormal craniofacial features and
anterior segment developmental anomalies (614195), Mintz-Hittner et al.
(2004) found a heterozygous G-to-T transversion at codon 256 in the CVC
domain of the VSX1 protein that resulted in a change of an alanine to
serine (A256S). The mutation was predicted to result in a change of
conformation and therefore activity of the protein. The A256S mutation
segregated with the 4 affected patients and was not found in any of 624
control chromosomes.

.0005
KERATOCONUS 1
VSX1, LEU17PRO

In 3 families with keratoconus-1 (148300), Bisceglia et al. (2005) found
a heterozygous T-to-C transition at nucleotide 323 in exon 1 of the VSX1
gene that resulted in a leu-to-pro substitution at amino acid 17 of the
protein (L17P). This substitution represents alteration of an amino acid
that has been well conserved from zebrafish to humans.

In 2 Italian patients with keratoconus, 1 sporadic and 1 familial, De
Bonis et al. (2011) detected the L17P allele; the variant was not found
in 200 controls.

611491	TITLE *611491 RAS ASSOCIATION AND DILUTE DOMAINS PROTEIN; RADIL
;;RAP GTPase INTERACTOR;;
KIAA1849
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2001) cloned KIAA1849. The transcript contains
repetitive elements in its 3-prime UTR, and the deduced 1,114-amino acid
protein contains a RAS (HRAS; 190020)-association domain, a PDZ domain,
and a DIL (see MYO5A; 160777) domain, suggesting it has a role in cell
signaling. RT-PCR ELISA detected highest expression in adult brain,
spinal cord, testis, and pancreas, moderate expression in heart, lung,
skeletal muscle, ovary, and fetal brain, and low expression in spleen,
kidney, and adult and fetal liver. Expression was moderate to high in
all specific adult brain regions examined, with highest levels in
cerebellum. Smolen et al. (2007) stated that the RADIL protein contains
1,075 amino acids.

GENE FUNCTION

By cotransfection in human embryonic kidney cells, Smolen et al. (2007)
showed that RADIL bound RAP (see RAP1A; 179520) but not any other RAS
family proteins. Knockdown of RADIL in mouse breast epithelial cells or
human chondrosarcoma cells resulted in reduced cell adhesion or
migration, respectively. Overexpression of a constitutively active form
of RAP or knockdown of RADIL in human embryonic kidney cells also
resulted in reduced cellular adhesion, suggesting that RADIL functions
downstream of RAP. Knockdown of radil in zebrafish embryos resulted in
multiple defects in neural crest cell-derived lineages, such as
cartilage, pigment cells, and enteric neurons. These defects were
primarily due to the diminished migratory capacity of neural crest
cells.

MAPPING

Hartz (2007) mapped the RADIL gene to chromosome 7p22.1 based on an
alignment of the RADIL sequence (GenBank GENBANK AB058752) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.1).

600253	TITLE *600253 ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR; AHR
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons, represented by
2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), are environmental pollutants
that are produced by minor side-reactions in chemical manufacturing
processes and by combustion of waste materials. These chemicals cause
potent and pleiotropic toxicity, including teratogenesis, immune
suppression, epithelial disorders, and tumor production in experimental
animals. At the molecular level, aldehyde dehydrogenase, quinone
reductase, and various drug-metabolizing enzymes are induced by the
chemicals in some cultured cells and some tissues of experimental
animals. All these biologic effects are thought to be mediated by an
intracellular aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR).

CLONING

Ema et al. (1994) isolated human cDNA for the AHR gene, using mouse cDNA
as a labeled probe. The deduced primary structure of human AHR showed an
overall amino acid similarity of 72.5% with that of the mouse
counterpart. Protein encoded by the AHR cDNA bound the inducer, TCDD,
with a high affinity in a 9S complex form.

GENE FUNCTION

A heterodimer of the dioxin receptor (AHR) and ARNT (126110), which are
basic helix-loop-helix/PAS family transcription factors, mediates most
of the toxic effects of dioxins. Ohtake et al. (2003) demonstrated that
the agonist-activated AHR/ARNT heterodimer directly associates with the
estrogen receptors ER-alpha (133430) and ER-beta (601663). They showed
that this association results in the recruitment of unliganded estrogen
receptor and the coactivator p300 (602700) to estrogen-responsive gene
promoters, leading to activation of transcription and estrogenic
effects. The function of liganded estrogen receptor was found to be
attenuated. Estrogenic actions of AHR agonists were detected in wildtype
ovariectomized mouse uteri, but were absent in Ahr -/- or Er-alpha -/-
ovariectomized mice. Ohtake et al. (2003) concluded that their findings
suggest a novel mechanism by which estrogen receptor-mediated signaling
is modulated by a coregulatory-like function of activated AHR/ARNT,
giving rise to adverse estrogen-related actions of dioxin-type
environmental contaminants.

Ohtake et al. (2007) characterized a fat-soluble ligand-dependent
ubiquitin ligase complex in human cell lines, in which AHR is integrated
as a component of a novel cullin-4B (300304) ubiquitin ligase complex,
CUL4B(AHR). Complex assembly and ubiquitin ligase activity of CUL4B(AHR)
in vitro and in vivo are dependent on the AHR ligand. In the CUL4B(AHR)
complex, ligand-activated AHR acts as a substrate-specific adaptor
component that targets sex steroid receptors for degradation. Ohtake et
al. (2007) concluded that their findings uncovered a function for AHR as
an atypical component of the ubiquitin ligase complex and demonstrated a
nongenomic signaling pathway in which fat-soluble ligands regulate
target protein-selective degradation through a ubiquitin ligase complex.

Quintana et al. (2008) found that activation of Ahr by a dioxin ligand
induced functional regulatory T lymphocytes (Treg cells) expressing
Foxp3 (300292) that were capable of suppressing experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis (EAE) in mice. In contrast, activation of Ahr by a
carbazole ligand boosted differentiation of T cells producing Il17 (see
603149) (Th17 cells), interfered with Treg development, and increased
the severity of EAE in mice. Quintana et al. (2008) concluded that AHR
regulates both Treg and Th17 cell differentiation in a ligand-specific
fashion and may constitute a unique target for therapeutic
immunomodulation.

Using FACS and RT-PCR analyses of mouse and human CD4 (186940)-positive
T cells, Veldhoen et al. (2008) found that expression of AHR was
restricted to Th17 cells and that AHR ligation resulted in production of
IL22 (605330). Cd4-positive cells from mice lacking Ahr developed Th17
responses but failed to produce Il22 and did not show enhanced Th17
development. Activation of Ahr during induction of EAE accelerated
disease onset and increased pathology in wildtype mice, but not in Ahr
-/- mice. Veldhoen et al. (2008) concluded that environmental pollutants
that activate AHR may initiate or augment autoimmune conditions.

Using an unbiased screen with primary human hematopoietic stem cells,
Boitano et al. (2010) identified a purine derivative, StemRegenin-1
(SR1), that promotes the ex vivo expansion of CD34 (142230)-positive
cells. Culture of hematopoietic stem cells with SR1 led to a 50-fold
increase in cells expressing CD34 and a 17-fold increase in cells that
retain the ability to engraft immunodeficient mice. Mechanistic studies
showed that SR1 acts by antagonizing the AHR. Boitano et al. (2010)
concluded that the identification of SR1 and AHR modulation as a means
to induce ex vivo hematopoietic stem cell expansion should facilitate
the clinical use of hematopoietic stem cell therapy.

Opitz et al. (2011) identified the tryptophan catabolite kynurenine
(kyn) as an endogenous ligand of the human AHR that is constitutively
generated by human tumor cells via tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO2;
191070), a liver- and neuron-derived trp-degrading enzyme. TDO-derived
kyn suppresses antitumor immune responses and promotes tumor cell
survival and motility through the AHR in an autocrine/paracrine fashion.
The TDO-AHR pathway is active in human brain tumors and is associated
with malignant progression and poor survival. Opitz et al. (2011)
concluded that because kyn is produced during cancer progression and
inflammation in the local microenvironment in amounts sufficient for
activating the human AHR, their results provided evidence for a
previously unidentified pathophysiologic function of the AHR with
profound implications for cancer and immune biology.

Innate lymphoid cells (ILC) expressing the transcription factor
ROR-gamma-t (see 602943) induce the postnatal formation of intestinal
lymphoid follicles and regulate intestinal homeostasis.
ROR-gamma-t-positive ILC express Ahr, a highly conserved,
ligand-inducible transcription factor believed to control adaptation of
multicellular organisms to environmental challenges. In mice, Kiss et
al. (2011) showed that Ahr is required for the postnatal expansion of
intestinal ROR-gamma-t-positive ILC and the formation of intestinal
lymphoid follicles. Ahr activity within ROR-gamma-t-positive ILC could
be induced by dietary ligands such as those contained in vegetables of
the family Brassicaceae. Ahr-deficient mice were highly susceptible to
infection with Citrobacter rodentium, a mouse model for attaching and
effacing infections. Kiss et al. (2011) concluded that their results
established a molecular link between nutrients and the formation of
immune system components required to maintain intestinal homeostasis and
resistance to infections.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization and by DNA blot hybridization
using human/mouse or human/Chinese hamster hybrid cell DNAs, Ema et al.
(1994) assigned the AHR gene to 7p21.

By use of PCR analysis of somatic cell hybrids and fluorescence in situ
hybridization of metaphase cells, Le Beau et al. (1994) localized the
AHR gene to 7p21-p15. Micka et al. (1997) localized the AHR gene to 7p15
using fluorescence in situ hybridization. Performing linkage analysis in
a 3-generation family, they showed with good probability that the high
CYP1A1 (108330) inducibility phenotype segregates with the 7p15 region.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Micka et al. (1997) sequenced 93 nucleotides (corresponding to 31 amino
acids) of exon 9 of the human AHR gene, which is the region
corresponding to that containing the mouse ala375-to-val polymorphism,
and found no nucleotide differences; val381 was present in all 5
individuals examined, 2 of whom showed 'high' and 3 of whom 'low' CYP1A1
inducibility.

ANIMAL MODEL

To determine whether the aryl hydrocarbon receptor plays a role in
modulating carcinogenesis through the induction of
xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes, Shimizu et al. (2000) studied
Ahr-deficient mice exposed to benzo(a)pyrene, a widely distributed
environmental carcinogen. They found that the carcinogenicity of this
agent was lost in Ahr-deficient mice. Shimizu et al. (2000) concluded
that the carcinogenic action of benzo(a)pyrene can be determined
primarily by AHR, a transcriptional regulator of the gene for CYP1A1.

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are toxic chemicals released
into the environment by fossil fuel combustion. Oocyte destruction and
ovarian failure occur in PAH-treated mice, and cigarette smoking causes
early menopause in women. In many cells, PAHs activate the AHR, a member
of the Per-Arnt-Sim family of transcription factors. The AHR is also
activated by dioxin, one of the most intensively studied environmental
contaminants. Matikainen et al. (2001) demonstrated that an exposure of
mice to PAHs induces the expression of Bax (600040) in oocytes, followed
by apoptosis. Ovarian damage caused by PAHs is prevented by Ahr or Bax
inactivation. Oocytes microinjected with a Bax promoter-reporter
construct show Ahr-dependent transcriptional activation after PAH, but
not dioxin, treatment, consistent with findings that dioxin is not
cytotoxic to oocytes. This difference in the action of PAHs versus
dioxin is conveyed by a single basepair flanking each Ahr response
element in the Bax promoter. Oocytes in human ovarian biopsies grafted
into immunodeficient mice also accumulated Bax and underwent apoptosis
after PAH exposure in vivo. Thus, Matikainen et al. (2001) concluded
that AHR-driven Bax transcription is a novel and evolutionarily
conserved cell-death signaling pathway responsible for environmental
toxicant-induced ovarian failure.

Environmental pollutants, notably polychlorinated dioxins and biphenyls,
represent well-characterized AHR ligands. The dioxin/AHR functions as a
ligand-activated transcription factor regulating transcription of a
battery of genes encoding xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes.
Loss-of-function (gene-disruption) studies in mice had demonstrated that
AHR is involved in toxic effects of dioxins but had not yielded
unequivocal results concerning the physiologic function of the receptor.
To unravel the biologic functions of AHR, Andersson et al. (2002)
performed gain-of-function studies. A constitutively active AHR
expressed in transgenic mice reduced the life span of the mice and
induced tumors in the glandular part of the stomach, demonstrating the
oncogenic potential of the AHR and implicating the receptor in
regulation of cell proliferation.

By targeted disruption of the Ahr gene in mice, Walisser et al. (2005)
demonstrated that Ahr signaling in endothelial/hematopoietic cells is
necessary for developmental closure of the ductus venosus, whereas Ahr
signaling in hepatocytes is necessary to generate adaptive and toxic
responses to dioxin exposure. They concluded that cell-specific receptor
signaling generates distinct AHR-dependent physiologic outcomes.

614905	TITLE *614905 SORTING NEXIN 8; SNX8
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SNX8 belongs to a large family of proteins characterized by the presence
of an SNX-type phox (see 608512) homology (PX) domain with conserved
arg-arg-tyr-X-asp/glu and pro-pro-X-pro-X-lys motifs. SNX family members
are predicted to be involved in the sorting of endosomes (Teasdale et
al., 2001).

CLONING

By searching databases for sequences similar to yeast Snx1 (601272),
Teasdale et al. (2001) identified human SNX8. The deduced protein has a
171-amino acid SNX-PH domain in its N-terminal half and a coiled-coil
domain in its C-terminal half.

Using confocal microscopy, Dyve et al. (2009) found that
fluorescence-tagged SNX8 partly colocalized with the endosome marker
EEA1 (605070) in punctate vesicular structures in transfected HeLa
cells. It also partly colocalized with the retromer components SNX1,
VPS35 (601501), SNX2 (605929), and VPS26 (VPS26A; 605506).

GENE FUNCTION

By knockdown of SNX8 in HeLa cells, Dyve et al. (2009) determined that
SNX8 regulates endosome-to-Golgi transport of Shiga toxin and the plant
toxin ricin, possibly via 2 different mechanisms. Knockdown of SNX8
increased Shiga toxin transport to the Golgi, but it moderately reduced
ricin transport. Knockdown of SNX8 had no effect on endocytosis of Shiga
toxin or ricin. Overexpression of fluorescence-tagged SNX8 resulted in a
change in morphology of SNX8-positive structures from small puncta to
enlarged vesicles or compartments. Inhibition of PI3 kinase (see 601232)
resulted in loss of punctate SNX8 localization. Dyve et al. (2009)
concluded that SNX8 is likely a negative regulator of endosome-to-Golgi
trafficking.

MAPPING

Hartz (2012) mapped the SNX8 gene to chromosome 7p22.3 based on an
alignment of the SNX8 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF121858) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

604108	TITLE *604108 MICROTUBULE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 7; MAP7
;;MICROTUBULE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN, EPITHELIAL, 115-KD; EMAP115;;
ENSCONSIN, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF; ENS
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Different types of microtubules (MTs), major components of the
cytoskeleton, contain different MT-associated proteins (MAPs), which
regulate the dynamics or stability of MTs. MAP7 is a retinoic
acid-inducible gene expressed in cells of epithelial origin and
implicated in microtubule functions required for spermatogenesis
(summary by Komada et al., 2000).

CLONING

By screening a HeLa cell expression library with antisera raised against
crude microtubule-binding proteins from HeLa cells, Masson and Kreis
(1993) isolated cDNAs encoding MAP7, which they designated EMAP115. The
predicted 749-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 84
kD, although it migrates anomalously at 115 kD by SDS-PAGE. EMAP115
contains a basic, highly charged N-terminal region that is separated
from an acidic C-terminal half by a stretch of amino acids rich in
proline and alanine (PAPA region). The N-terminal basic domain contains
the EMAP115 microtubule-binding site. Using immunoblots, the authors
determined that EMAP115 is predominantly expressed in cells of
epithelial origin. Immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy
indicated that it is specifically associated with microtubules in HeLa
cells. Overexpression of the N-terminal microtubule-binding domain in
monkey fibroblasts, which do not have significant levels of endogenous
EMAP115, led to stabilization of microtubules. Masson and Kreis (1993)
concluded that EMAP115 is a microtubule-stabilizing protein that may
play an important role in reorganization of microtubules during
polarization and differentiation of epithelial cells.

Vitamin A deficiency causes a number of defects, including deficient
spermatogenesis. Almost all of these defects are reversible by the
administration of a vitamin A metabolite, retinoic acid (RA), which
binds and activates 2 types of receptor families, RAR (e.g., RARA;
180240) and RXR (e.g., RXRA; 180245). Using gene trap mutagenesis on
mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells, Komada et al. (2000) identified MAP7 as
an RA-responsive gene. The gene trap insertion led to a null allele of
the Map7 gene that the authors designated ROSA63. Northern blot analysis
detected broad expression of a 3.4-kb Map7 transcript, as well as a
testis-specific 2.5-kb transcript, in wildtype mice, with lower
expression in heterozygous ROSA63 mice and no expression in homozygous
ROSA63 mice, consistent with a null allele. The authors showed that RA
induces Map7 expression in ES cells in vitro and in vitamin A-deficient
mice in vivo.

GENE FUNCTION

Metzger et al. (2012) identified the microtubule-associated protein
ensconsin (ens)/MAP7 and kinesin heavy chain (KHC)/KIF5B (602809) as
essential, evolutionarily conserved regulators of myonuclear positioning
in Drosophila and cultured mammalian myotubes. Metzger et al. (2012)
found that these proteins interact physically and that expression of the
KIF5B motor domain fused to the MAP7 microtubule-binding domain rescues
nuclear positioning defects in MAP7-depleted cells. This suggested that
MAP7 links KIF5B to the microtubule cytoskeleton to promote nuclear
positioning. Finally, Metzger et al. (2012) showed that myonuclear
positioning is physiologically important. Drosophila ens mutant larvae
have decreased locomotion and incorrect myonuclear positioning, and
these phenotypes are rescued by muscle-specific expression of ens.
Metzger et al. (2012) concluded that improper nuclear positioning
contributes to muscle dysfunction in a cell-autonomous fashion.

ANIMAL MODEL

Komada et al. (2000) identified a gene trap insertion that resulted in a
null allele, designated ROSA63, of the Map7 gene. Male mice with the
ROSA63 mutation, though able to copulate, were sterile and had smaller
testes and epididymis than wildtype mice, while other organs were of
normal size. Histologic analysis showed that ROSA63 mutant mice
exhibited defective spermatogenesis, with spermatid deformation in the
first wave of spermatogenesis and subsequent germ cell loss. Both of
these abnormalities were associated with morphologically abnormal MTs in
the manchette of the spermatids and in Sertoli cells. Komada et al.
(2000) noted that similar defects occur in Rara knockout mice, but not
in other RA receptor knockout mice.

MAPPING

By interspecific backcross analysis, Komada et al. (2000) mapped the
mouse Map7 gene to the proximal region of chromosome 10 in a region
showing homology of synteny with human 6q22-q25. The authors noted that
this localization implies that MAP7 is a candidate autosomal infertility
gene.

;;ONCOGENE RAF1;;
TRANSFORMING REPLICATION-DEFECTIVE MURINE RETROVIRUS 3611-MSV;;
ONCOGENE MIL;;

RAF1/SRGAP3 FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Rapp et al. (1983) cloned a unique acutely transforming
replication-defective mouse type C virus and characterized its acquired
oncogene, called v-raf. The viral genome bears close similarities to the
Moloney murine leukemia virus (see MOS, 190060). The cellular homolog,
c-raf, is present in 1 or 2 copies per haploid genome in mouse and human
DNA. The MIL oncogene, a second oncogene in the avian retrovirus MH2,
which contains the MYC oncogene, is the avian equivalent of the murine
RAF oncogene, i.e., they are identical.

MAPPING

Bonner et al. (1984) assigned the RAF1 gene to chromosome 3p25 by in
situ hybridization. This suggested that RAF1 may be involved in mixed
parotid gland tumors with the t(3;8)(p25;q21) translocation (Mark et
al., 1980, 1982).

Tory et al. (1992) constructed a genetic linkage map of 96 loci on 3p,
extending from the terminal band to the centromere. Multipoint linkage
analysis indicated that the male, female, and sex-averaged maps extend
for 102, 147, and 116 cM, respectively. RAF1 and 16 DNA markers were
localized by fluorescence in situ hybridization. RAF1 was regionalized
to 3p25.

- Pseudogenes

Bonner et al. (1984) showed that RAF2, a processed pseudogene, is on
chromosome 4.

Hiroshige et al. (1986) assigned the RAF2 pseudogene to region 4pter-p15
by the study of hybrid cells containing various chromosome 4 regions.

GENE FUNCTION

The function of RAF1 was reviewed by Li et al. (1991).

Wang et al. (1996) showed that RAF1 can be targeted to the mitochondria
by BCL2 (151430), a regulator of apoptotic cell death. Active RAF1
improved BCL2-mediated resistance to apoptosis. They also showed that
RAF1 phosphorylates BAD (603167).

Alavi et al. (2003) showed that basic fibroblast growth factor (FGFB;
134920) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF; 192240)
differentially activate Raf1, resulting in protection from distinct
pathways of apoptosis in human endothelial cells and chick embryo
vasculature. BFGF activated Raf1 via p21-activated protein kinase-1
(PAK1; 602590) phosphorylation of serines 338 and 339, resulting in Raf1
mitochondrial translocation and endothelial cell protection from the
intrinsic pathway of apoptosis, independent of the mitogen-activated
protein kinase kinase-1 (MEK1; 176872). In contrast, VEGF activated Raf1
via Src kinase (CSK; 124095), leading to phosphorylation of tyrosines
340 and 341 and MEK1-dependent protection from extrinsic-mediated
apoptosis. Alavi et al. (2003) concluded that RAF1 may be a pivotal
regulator of endothelial cell survival during angiogenesis.

Lorenz et al. (2003) demonstrated that the RAF kinase inhibitor protein
(RKIP; 604591) is a physiologic inhibitor of GRK2 (109635). After
stimulation of G protein-coupled receptors, RKIP dissociates from its
known target, RAF1, to associate with GRK2 and block its activity. This
switch is triggered by a protein kinase C (PKC; see 176960)-dependent
phosphorylation of RKIP on serine-153. Lorenz et al. (2003) concluded
that their data delineate a new principle in signal transduction: by
activating PKC, the incoming receptor signal is enhanced both by
removing an inhibitor from RAF1 and by blocking receptor
internalization. A physiologic role for this mechanism is shown in
cardiomyocytes in which the downregulation of RKIP restrains
beta-adrenergic signaling and contractile activity.

O'Neill et al. (2004) used proteomic analysis of RAF1 signaling
complexes to show that RAF1 counteracts apoptosis by suppressing the
activation of mammalian sterile 20-like kinase (MST2; 605030). RAF1
prevents dimerization and phosphorylation of the activation loop of MST2
independently of its protein kinase activity. Depletion of MST2 from
Raf1-null mouse or human cells abrogated sensitivity to apoptosis,
whereas overexpression of MST2 induced apoptosis. Conversely, depletion
of Raf1 from Raf1 +/+ mouse or human cells led to MST2 activation and
apoptosis. The concomitant depletion of both RAF1 and MST2 prevented
apoptosis.

By creating a kinase-defective version of Raf1 in mice or by using a
Raf1 inhibitor, Noble et al. (2008) showed that Raf1 autophosphorylation
on ser621 prevented its degradation by the proteasome.

Using Drosophila Schneider S2 cells, Rajakulendran et al. (2009)
demonstrated that RAF catalytic function is regulated in response to a
specific mode of dimerization of its kinase domain, which they termed
the side-to-side dimer. Moreover, they found that the RAF-related
pseudokinase KSR (601132) also participates in forming side-to-side
heterodimers with RAF and can thereby trigger RAF activation. This
mechanism provides an elegant explanation for the longstanding conundrum
about RAF catalytic activation, and also provides an explanation for the
capacity of KSR, despite lacking catalytic function, to directly mediate
RAF activation.

Hollander et al. (2010) found that microRNA-212 (MIR212; 613487) was
upregulated in the dorsal striatum of rats with a history of extended
access to cocaine. Striatal miR212 decreased responsiveness to the
motivational properties of cocaine by markedly amplifying the
stimulatory effects of the drug on Creb (123810) signaling. Studies in
rats and HEK cells showed that amplification of CREB signaling occurred
through miR212-enhanced RAF1 activity, resulting in adenylyl cyclase
sensitization and increased expression of the essential Creb coactivator
TORC (see CRTC1; 607536). miR212 activated RAF1, at least in part,
through repression of SPRED1 (609291). Hollander et al. (2010) concluded
that striatal miR212 signaling has a key role in determining
vulnerability to cocaine addiction.

- Oncogenic Function

Shimizu et al. (1985) identified the activated RAF gene in the stomach
cancer of a Japanese patient. Stomach cancer is the most common cancer
in Japan. Fukui et al. (1985) found that transforming DNA in a human
glioblastoma line was apparently the RAF gene. Teyssier et al. (1986)
presented evidence for a relationship of RAF1 to renal cell carcinoma
(144700).

Kasid et al. (1987) transfected tumor cell DNA into NIH/3T3 cells to
demonstrate that a radiation-resistant laryngeal carcinoma cell line
contained altered RAF1 sequences. The karyotype of the tumor cells
showed absence of chromosome 3, and transformed cells had double-minute
chromosomes.

Poulikakos et al. (2010) used chemical genetic methods to show that
drug-mediated transactivation of RAF dimers is responsible for the
paradoxical activation of the enzyme by inhibitors. Induction of ERK
signaling requires direct binding of the drug to the ATP-binding site of
one kinase of the dimer and is dependent on RAS activity. Drug binding
to one member of RAF homodimers (CRAF-CRAF) or heterodimers (CRAF-BRAF)
inhibits one promoter, but results in transactivation of the drug-free
protomer. In BRAF(V600E) (164757.0001) tumors, RAS is not activated,
thus transactivation is minimal and ERK signaling is inhibited in cells
exposed to RAF inhibitors. These results indicated that RAF inhibitors
will be effective in tumors in which BRAF is mutated. Furthermore,
because RAF inhibitors do not inhibit ERK signaling in other cells, the
model predicted that they would have a higher therapeutic index and
greater antitumor activity than mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase
(MEK) inhibitors, but could also cause toxicity due to the MEK/ERK
activation. Poulikakos et al. (2010) noted that these predictions were
borne out in a clinical trial of the RAF inhibitor PLX4032, as reported
by Chapman et al. (2009) and Flaherty et al. (2009). The model indicated
that promotion of RAF dimerization by elevation of wildtype RAF
expression or RAS activity could lead to drug resistance in mutant BRAF
tumors. In agreement with this prediction, RAF inhibitors do not inhibit
ERK signaling in cells that coexpress BRAF(V600E) and mutant RAS.

Hatzivassiliou et al. (2010) demonstrated that ATP-competitive RAF
inhibitors have 2 opposing mechanisms of action depending on the
cellular context. In BRAF(V600E) tumors, RAF inhibitors effectively
block the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway and
decrease tumor growth. Notably, in KRAS mutant and RAS/RAF wildtype
tumors, RAF inhibitors activate the RAF-MEK-ERK pathway in a
RAS-dependent manner, thus enhancing tumor growth in some xenograft
models. Inhibitor binding activates wildtype RAF isoforms by inducing
dimerization, membrane localization, and interaction with RAS-GTP. These
events occur independently of kinase inhibition and are, instead, linked
to direct conformational effects of inhibitors on the RAF kinase domain.
On the basis of these findings, Hatzivassiliou et al. (2010)
demonstrated that ATP-competitive kinase inhibitors can have opposing
functions as inhibitors or activators of signaling pathways, depending
on the cellular context. The authors stated that their work provided new
insights into the therapeutic use of ATP-competitive RAF inhibitors.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Pandit et al. (2007) analyzed the RAF1 gene in 231 individuals with
Noonan syndrome who did not have mutations in the PTPN11 (176876), KRAS
(190070), or SOS1 (182530) genes, and in 6 persons with LEOPARD syndrome
who did not have mutations in PTPN11. They identified 13 different
missense mutations (see, e.g., 164760.0001-164760.0003) in 18 unrelated
patients with NS (NS5; 611553) and 2 missense mutations (164760.0001 and
164760.0004) in 2 patients with LEOPARD syndrome (611554), respectively.
Most mutations altered a motif flanking ser259 located in the CR2
domain, critical for autoinhibition of RAF1 through 14-3-3 (see 113508)
binding. Of 17 NS patients with a RAF1 mutation in either of 2 hotspots
(clustering around ser259 or ser612), 16 (94%) had hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy (CMH; see 192600), compared with an 18% prevalence of CMH
among NS patients in general. Pandit et al. (2007) also scanned RAF1
exons mutated in NS and LEOPARD patients in 241 unrelated individuals
with nonsyndromic CMH who did not have mutations in 8 myofilament genes
known to cause CMH, and the authors identified a thr260-to-ile mutation
in the RAF1 gene in 1 patient. Ectopically expressed RAF1 mutants from
the 2 CMH hotspots had increased kinase activity and enhanced ERK (see
176948) activation, whereas non-CMH-associated mutants were kinase
impaired.

Razzaque et al. (2007) analyzed the RAF1 gene in 30 individuals
clinically diagnosed with Noonan syndrome who were negative for
mutations in the PTPN11, KRAS, HRAS (190020), or SOS1 genes, and
identified 5 different missense mutations in RAF1 in 10 (33%)
individuals. The authors noted that 8 of the 10 mutation-positive
patients with 1 of 4 mutations causing changes in the CR2 domain of RAF1
(see, e.g., 164760.0001 and 164760.0003) had hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy, whereas the 2 affected individuals with a mutation
leading to changes in the CR3 domain did not (164760.0004). Transfection
studies in HEK293 cells demonstrated that all 5 mutations in RAF1
behaved as gain-of-function mutants with increased kinase and ERK
activation compared with wildtype RAF1.

CYTOGENETICS

Jones et al. (2009) found a tandem duplication at chromosome 3p25 in a
pilocytic astrocytoma (see 137800) that resulted in fusion of exons 1
through 12 of the SRGAP3 gene (606525) to exons 10 through 17 of the
RAF1 gene. The fusion transcript encodes a deduced protein containing
the first 513 N-terminal amino acids of SRGAP3, including the FES
(190030)/CIP4 (TRIP10; 604504) homology domain, fused to 318 C-terminal
amino acids of RAF1, including the entire RAF1 kinase domain. The fusion
protein showed higher activity than wildtype RAF1 in phosphorylation of
endogenous Mek1 in mouse fibroblasts, and it conferred
anchorage-independent cell growth.

ANIMAL MODEL

To examine the in vivo role of RAF1 in the heart, Yamaguchi et al.
(2004) generated cardiac muscle-specific Raf1 conditionally deleted
mice. The mice demonstrated left ventricular systolic dysfunction and
heart dilation without cardiac hypertrophy or lethality, and showed a
significant increase in the number of apoptotic cardiomyocytes. The
expression level and activation of MEK1/2 (see 176872 and 601263,
respectively) and ERK (see 601795) showed no difference, but the kinase
activity of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase-1 (ASK1; 602448), JNK
(see 601158), and p38 (600289) increased significantly compared to that
of controls. The ablation of ASK1 rescued heart dysfunction and
dilatation as well as cardiac fibrosis. Yamaguchi et al. (2004)
concluded that RAF1 promotes cardiomyocyte survival through a
MEK/ERK-independent mechanism.

heterozygosity for a 770C-T transition in exon 7 of the RAF1 gene,
resulting in a ser257-to-leu (S257L) substitution at a conserved residue
in the CR2 domain. All patients had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (CMH),
including a 3.6-year-old girl with CMH at birth and a 35-year-old woman
with LEOPARD syndrome. Ectopically expressed S257L mutants demonstrated
increased kinase activity and enhanced ERK (see 176948) activation.

Razzaque et al. (2007) identified the S257L mutation of the RAF1 gene in
4 unrelated patients with Noonan syndrome, 3 with obstructive and 1 with
nonobstructive CMH. The mutation was not found in 100 control
individuals or in 100 patients with CMH without Noonan syndrome.

NOONAN SYNDROME 5
RAF1, PRO261SER

In 5 affected individuals of 2 unrelated families with Noonan syndrome
(NS5; 611553), Pandit et al. (2007) identified heterozygosity for a
781C-T transition in exon 7 of the RAF1 gene, resulting in a
pro261-to-ser (P261S) substitution at a conserved residue in the CR2
domain. Four of the 5 patients had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (CMH);
the 1 individual with a P261S change but without CMH was a 6-year-old
girl whose 38-year-old mother had the same mutation and had been
diagnosed with CMH at 23 years of age. The mutation was not found in 210
control individuals.

Razzaque et al. (2007) identified the P261S mutation in 3 Noonan
syndrome patients, a 1-year-old boy and his 33-year-old father and an
unrelated 16-year-old boy. All 3 displayed CMH. The mutation was not
found in 100 control individuals or in 100 individuals with CMH without
Noonan syndrome. Transfection studies in HEK293 cells demonstrated that
P261S behaved as a gain-of-function mutant with increased kinase and ERK
(see 176948) activation compared with wildtype RAF1.

.0003
NOONAN SYNDROME 5
RAF1, THR491ARG

In a sister and brother with Noonan syndrome (NS5; 611553), Pandit et
al. (2007) identified heterozygosity for a 1472C-G transversion in exon
14 of the RAF1 gene, resulting in a thr491-to-arg (T491R) substitution
in the CR3 domain. Neither sib had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The
mutation was not found in 210 control individuals.

.0004
LEOPARD SYNDROME 2
NOONAN SYNDROME 5, INCLUDED
RAF1, LEU613VAL

In a 43-year-old woman with LEOPARD syndrome-2 (611554), Pandit et al.
(2007) identified an 1837C-G transversion in exon 17 of the RAF1 gene,
resulting in a leu613-to-val (L613V) substitution at a conserved residue
in the C terminus. The patient had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

Razzaque et al. (2007) identified the L613V mutation, which they
designated as being located in the CR3 domain of RAF1, in 2 unrelated
boys with Noonan syndrome (NS5; 611553), neither of whom had
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The mutation was not found in 100 control
individuals or in 100 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy without
Noonan syndrome. Transfection studies in HEK293 cells demonstrated that
L613V behaved as a gain-of-function mutant with increased kinase and ERK
(see 176948) activation compared with wildtype RAF1.

;;ALPHA-2,8-SIALYLTRANSFERASE II;;

SIALYLTRANSFERASE X; STX
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The adhesive properties of neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM1; 116930)
are modulated by its linkage to polysialic acid (PSA). This linkage is
regulated by sialyltransferases, such as sialyltransferase X (STX) and
polysialyltransferase (PST, or ST8SIA4; 602547).

CLONING

STX was originally cloned as a developmentally regulated
sialyltransferase from the rat fetal brain (Livingston and Paulson,
1993). Scheidegger et al. (1995) used sequences of rodent STX to clone
the human cDNA from a fetal heart library. The cDNA encodes a predicted
375-amino acid polypeptide which is 59% identical to human PST and 31%
identical to human sialyltransferase-8 (601123). The STX sequence
predicts a protein with a single transmembrane domain and a general
structure typical of glycosyltransferases. Scheidegger et al. (1995)
reported that STX transcripts are present in a PSA-positive,
NCAM1-positive small cell carcinoma cell line, but are absent in a
variant of this cell line selected to be PSA-negative and
NCAM1-positive. Transfection with STX can restore PSA expression to
these and other PSA-negative cells, implying that STX is a functional
sialyltransferase for NCAM1.

Using Northern blot analysis, Kitagawa and Paulson (1994) evaluated the
differential expression of 5 human sialyltransferase genes in adult and
fetal tissues. A 5.7-kb STX transcript was expressed moderately in fetal
brain, kidney, and heart and at low levels in adult heart and thymus. No
expression was detected in the other 14 adult tissues examined or in
fetal lung and liver.

Angata et al. (1997) examined the expression patterns of STX and PST.
STX is primarily expressed in embryonic tissues but only modestly in
adult heart, brain, and thymus. Relative amounts of STX and PST differ
in various brain regions but in some locations both may be active.

GENE FUNCTION

Angata et al. (1997) found that cells cotransfected with NCAM1 and STX
can support neurite outgrowth better than cells transfected with NCAM1
alone, but not as well as cells cotransfected with NCAM1 and PST.

Polysialic acid has been implicated in numerous normal and pathologic
processes, including development, neuronal plasticity, and tumor
metastasis. Mahal et al. (2001) reported that cell surface PSA
expression can be reversibly inhibited by a small molecule,
N-butanoylmannosamine. Inhibition occurs through a metabolic mechanism
in which N-butanoylmannosamine is converted to unnatural sialic acid
derivatives that effectively act as chain terminators during cellular
PSA biosynthesis. N-propanoylmannosamine, which differs from
N-butanoylmannosamine by a single methylene group, did not inhibit PSA
biosynthesis. Modulation of PSA expression by chemical means has a role
complementary to genetic and biochemical approaches in the study of
complex PSA-mediated events.

Angata et al. (2000) compared the sialyltransferase activities of
ST8SIA2, ST8SIA3 (609478), and ST8SIA4. All 3 enzymes could add
oligosialic and polysialic acid on various sialylated
N-acetyllactosaminyl oligosaccharides, including NCAM. N-glycans, fetuin
N-glycans, synthetic sialylated N-acetyllactosamines, and
alpha-2-Heremans Schmid glycoprotein. The 3 enzymes could also use
themselves as substrates in autopolysialylation reactions. The enzymes
differed in the efficiency of adding polysialic acid on NCAM, and
ST8SIA3 did not use NCAM as substrate. Upon transfection and
overexpression in HeLa cells, ST8SIA2 and ST8SIA4 formed polysialic acid
on glycoproteins in the perinuclear Golgi compartment and on
glycoproteins on the cell surface. ST8SIA3 only formed polysialic acid
on Golgi glycoproteins, confirming that it does not use cell-surface
NCAM as substrate.

MAPPING

By FISH, Angata et al. (1997) mapped the STX gene to human chromosome
15q26.

ANIMAL MODEL

Angata et al. (2004) found that St8sia2-null mice were born near
mendelian frequencies. Loss of St8sia2 did not impair hippocampal
synaptic plasticity, as in St8sia4-deficient mice, but resulted in
misguidance of infrapyramidal mossy fibers and formation of ectopic
synapses in the hippocampus. St8sia2-deficient mice exhibited higher
exploratory drive and reduced behavioral responses to Pavlovian fear
conditioning.

611835	TITLE *611835 MITOCHONDRIAL RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN L22; MRPL22
;;MRPL25
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Mitochondria have their own translation system for production of 13
proteins essential for oxidative phosphorylation. MRPL22 is 1 of more
than 70 protein components of mitochondrial ribosomes that are encoded
by the nuclear genome (Kenmochi et al., 2001).

CLONING

By searching databases for homologs of rat Mrpl25, Goldschmidt-Reisin et
al. (1998) identified mouse and human MRPL22, which they called MRPL25.
The deduced 223-amino acid human MRPL22 protein contains a 33-amino acid
N-terminal mitochondrial import signal. The human and rodent MRPL22
proteins are highly similar, except for their C termini.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis and analysis of an integrated BAC-STS map,
Kenmochi et al. (2001) mapped the MRPL22 gene to chromosome 5q33.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Hishikawa et al. (2008) cloned mouse Mboat2, which they called Lpcat4.
The deduced 519-amino acid protein contains 4 putative transmembrane
domains. RT-PCR detected high Lpcat4 expression in epididymis, brain,
testis, and ovary. Lpcat4 colocalized with an endoplasmic reticulum
marker protein in transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Hishikawa et al. (2008) found that mouse Lpcat4 converted
lysophosphatidylcholine and lysophosphatidylethanolamine to
phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine, respectively, and
preferred oleoyl-CoA as the acyl donor.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the MBOAT2
gene to chromosome 2 (TMAP RH80026).

605503	TITLE *605503 M-PHASE PHOSPHOPROTEIN 10; MPHOSPH10
;;MPP10
DESCRIPTION Progression of cells from interphase to mitosis involves alterations in
cell structures and activities. The transition from G2 to M phase is
induced by M phase-promoting factor, or MPF (see CCNB1; 123836). In M
phase, many proteins are phosphorylated directly by MPF or indirectly by
kinases activated by MPF. These M-phase phosphoproteins (MPPs, or
MPHOSPHs) permit disassembly of interphase structures and generation of
M-phase enzymatic activities and structures.

By treating bacterial expression libraries with M-phase cytosol
containing the relevant kinases in the presence of a phosphatase
inhibitor, followed by immunoscreening with MPM2 antibody,
Matsumoto-Taniura et al. (1996) isolated cDNAs for a number of MPHOSPHs,
including MPHOSPH10, which they called MPP10. Immunoblot analysis showed
that when phosphorylated, MPHOSPH10 is expressed as a 120-kD protein in
M-phase cells. Immunofluorescence microscopy localized MPHOSPH10 in the
nucleus, almost entirely in nucleoli, in interphase. In mitotic cells,
MPHOSPH10 adhered to chromosomes in a manner similar to fibrillarin
(FBL; 134795).

Westendorf et al. (1998) obtained a full-length cDNA encoding MPHOSPH10
by screening cDNA libraries, PCR, and 5-prime RACE. Sequence analysis
predicted that the 681-amino acid protein has a PEST sequence and 6
coiled-coil alpha helices containing acidic and basic stretches found in
many nucleolar proteins. Cell fractionation and immunoblot analysis
confirmed the nuclear and nucleolar localization of MPHOSPH10. Detailed
examination of different phases of the cell cycle by immunofluorescence
microscopy showed that MPHOSPH10 colocalizes with fibrillarin and is a
component of U3 small nucleolar ribonucleoproteins (snoRNPs). However,
Northern blot analysis established that MPHOSPH10 is not a major
component of ribonuclear particles containing snoRNAs other than U3.
Confocal microscopy demonstrated that MPHSPH10 does not colocalize in
coiled bodies with FBL or with p80 coilin (COIL; 600272). MPHOSPH10 was
found in telophase bodies distinct from most of the FBL-containing
bodies. Westendorf et al. (1998) concluded that MPHOSPH10 is involved in
rRNA processing.

608897	TITLE *608897 UNC13, C. ELEGANS, HOMOLOG OF, D; UNC13D
;;MUNC13-4
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By coimmunopurification of GTP-RAB27A (603868)-interacting proteins in
platelets, followed by sequence analysis, database analysis, and PCR of
a bone marrow cDNA library, Shirakawa et al. (2004) cloned full-length
UNC13D, which they called MUNC13-4. The deduced 1,090-amino acid protein
contains 2 calcium-binding C2 domains and 2 Munc13 homology domains, but
it lacks the N-terminal region containing a phorbol ester-binding C1
domain present in other Munc13 proteins, such as UNC13B (605836).
MUNC13-4 distributed between the cytosol and membrane fractions in
permeabilized platelets.

Using Northern blot analysis, Feldmann et al. (2003) detected a 4.5-kb
UNC13D transcript that was highly expressed in spleen, thymus, and
peripheral blood leukocytes. Faint expression was detected in small
intestine, prostate, ovary, and colon. RT-PCR analysis showed high
expression of UNC13D in all hematopoietic tissues and cells examined. In
nonhematopoietic tissues, strong expression of UNC13D was detected only
in lung and placenta, with weak expression in brain, heart, skeletal
muscle, and kidney.

GENE FUNCTION

Secretion of the contents of cytolytic granules at the immunologic
synapse is a highly regulated process essential for lymphocyte
cytotoxicity. This process requires the rapid transfer of perforin
(170280)-containing lytic granules to the target cell interface,
followed by their docking and fusion with the plasma membrane. Feldmann
et al. (2003) found that expressed tagged UNC13D localized with
cytotoxic granules at the immunologic synapse. Using UNC13D-deficient
cells, they determined that UNC13D is essential for the priming step of
cytolytic granule secretion preceding vesicle membrane fusion.

Shirakawa et al. (2004) found that MUNC13-4 bound GTP-RAB27A and
GTP-RAB27B (603869) in vitro, but not other GTPases, and it enhanced
platelet secretion in an in vitro assay.

GENE STRUCTURE

Feldmann et al. (2003) determined that the UNC13D gene contains 32
exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Feldmann et al. (2003) mapped the UNC13D
gene to chromosome 17q25.1.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Feldmann et al. (2003) identified 6 mutations in the UNC13D gene in
patients with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis-3 (FHL3; 608898). They
found that UNC13D deficiency resulted in defective cytolytic granule
exocytosis, despite polarization of the secretory granules and docking
with the plasma membrane.

Mutations in the perforin gene (PRF1; 170280) account for only about 40%
of cases of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Lack of a genetic marker
hampers the diagnosis, suitability for transplantation, selection of
familial donors, identification of carriers, genetic counseling, and
prenatal diagnosis.

Noting that mutations in the perforin gene (PRF1; 170280) account for
only about 40% of cases of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, Santoro
et al. (2006) sequenced the UNC13D gene in 30 probands with
hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis who did not have mutations in PRF1.
In 15 families, 12 novel and 4 known mutations were found, spread
throughout the gene (see, e.g., 608897.0001, 608897.0006, and
608897.0009). The mutations were homozygous in 8 families, whereas 7
families had compound heterozygotic mutations.

ANIMAL MODEL

Crozat et al. (2007) described Jinx, an N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea-induced
murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) susceptibility mutation in C57BL/6 mice.
They identified the Jinx mutation as an insertion of 53 nucleotides from
intron 26 into exon 26 of the Unc13d gene, resulting in a 20-amino acid
insertion, followed by premature termination after amino acid 859. In
addition to increased MCMV viral titers and lethality comparable to that
observed in susceptible BALB/c mice, Jinx mice produced high levels of
Ifng (147570) and Ifna (147660)/Ifnb (147640) after infection, but they
were unable to kill natural killer (NK) target cells. Both NK and
cytotoxic T lymphocytes failed to degranulate in Jinx mice. Jinx mice
showed no increased susceptibility to Listeria monocytogenes. Jinx mice
developed an FHL3-like phenotype after infection with lymphocytic
choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), but not after infection with MCMV. One
exception to the FHL3-like phenotype was that instead of neutropenia,
Jinx mice developed neutrophilia after infection with LCMV. Crozat et
al. (2007) concluded that development of hemophagocytic
lymphohistiocytosis in mice is conditional and proposed that there may
also be a specific infectious trigger of FHL3 in humans.

Using Jinx mice to analyze platelet granule release and secretion, Ren
et al. (2010) observed complete ablation of release from dense granules
and compromised activity from alpha granules and lysosomes. Platelets
from Jinx mice showed attenuated aggregation, and Jinx mice had
prolonged bleeding times. Defective release was rescued by addition of
recombinant human UNC13D to permeabilized Jinx platelets. Unc13d levels
correlated directly with the extent of granule release from wildtype and
Jinx heterozygous mouse platelets. Ren et al. (2010) concluded that
UNC13D is a limiting factor required for platelet secretion and
hemostasis.

602490	TITLE *602490 NUCLEAR RECEPTOR-INTERACTING PROTEIN 1; NRIP1
;;RECEPTOR-INTERACTING PROTEIN 140; RIP140
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Cavailles et al. (1995) identified receptor-interacting protein-140
(RIP140) by virtue of its direct association with a transcriptional
activation domain of estrogen receptor (ESR; 133430) in the presence of
estrogen.

Using the ligand-binding domain of Tr2 (NR2C1; 601529) as bait in a
yeast 2-hybrid screen of an embryonic mouse cDNA library, Lee et al.
(1998) cloned Rip140. Like the 1,158-amino acid human protein, the
deduced mouse protein contains 9 LxxLL signature motifs. Northern blot
analysis detected an 8-kb Rip140 transcript in all adult mouse tissues
examined and in embryonic day-12.5 placenta and embryos.

GENE FUNCTION

L'Horset et al. (1996) identified 2 binding sites in RIP140 that
interacted with the ligand-binding domain of ESR both in solution and
when the receptor was bound to DNA. Both sites independently interacted
with other nuclear receptors, including thyroid hormone receptors (e.g.,
THRB; 190160) and retinoic acid receptors (e.g., RARB; 180220), but
their binding properties were not identical. These interactions were
enhanced by receptor agonists, but not by antagonists, and in vitro
binding of RIP140 to a number of mutant receptors correlated with their
ability to stimulate transcription in vivo. When RIP140 was fused to
heterologous DNA-binding domains, it could stimulate transcription of
reporter genes in both yeast and mammalian cells. L'Horset et al. (1996)
concluded that RIP140 functions as a bridge between receptors and the
basal transcription machinery and thereby stimulates transcription of
target genes.

By mutation analysis, Lee et al. (1998) determined that the LxxLL motifs
of mouse Rip140 interacted with the activation function-2 region of Tr2.
Coimmunoprecipitation experiments detected interaction between the 2
proteins in cell extracts. Rip140 repressed binding of Tr2 to target DNA
and suppressed induction of retinoic acid (RA) receptor (see 180240) by
RA in a dose-dependent manner. In the presence of Rip140, Tr2
translocated into the nucleus.

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis, protein pull-down assays, and
coimmunoprecipitation analysis, Sugawara et al. (2001) showed that
RIP140 interacted with SF1 (NR5A1; 184757) and DAX1 (NR0B1; 300473),
which control expression of STAR (600617), a regulator of
intramitochondrial cholesterol transport. Using reporter gene
constructs, they showed that RIP140 inhibited STAR expression in an
SF1-dependent manner. RIP140 and DAX1 inhibited cAMP-stimulated activity
of an SF1 response element synergistically.

White et al. (2008) reviewed the fundamental role of RIP140 in normal
cellular function, as well as in pathology of metabolic diseases. They
stated that RIP140 can act as a transcriptional repressor or activator
depending upon the transcriptional factors with which it interacts. The
repressive function of RIP140 can be modulated posttranslationally by
phosphorylation, arginine methylation, acetylation, and conjugation of
lys613 with pyridoxal 5-prime-phosphate.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Cavailles et al. (1995) mapped
the RIP140 gene to chromosome 21q11. Katsanis et al. (1998) used
hybrids, YACs, and PACs to place the RIP140 gene on the physical map of
chromosome 21; 21q11 is a gene-poor region.

ANIMAL MODEL

White et al. (2000) found that Rip140-null mice were viable but smaller
than their wildtype littermates. Female mice were completely infertile
due to complete failure of mature follicles to release oocytes at
ovulation. In contrast, luteinization proceeded normally in Rip140-null
mice, resulting in a phenotype similar to luteinized unruptured follicle
syndrome in women.

Leonardsson et al. (2004) found that Rip140 -/- mice were lean, resisted
high-fat diet-induced obesity and hepatic steatosis, and had increased
oxygen consumption. Although adipogenesis was unaffected, expression of
certain lipogenic enzymes was reduced. In contrast, genes involved in
energy dissipation and mitochondrial uncoupling, including uncoupling
protein-1 (UCP1; 113730), were markedly increased. Leonardsson et al.
(2004) concluded that RIP140 regulates the expression of genes involved
in energy homeostasis.

605211	TITLE *605211 BARH-LIKE 1; BARHL1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The BarH1 and BarH2 (Bar) Drosophila genes are homeobox-containing
genes, which are required for the fate determination of external sensory
organs in the fly. Using a bioinformatic approach, Bulfone et al. (2000)
identified murine and human homeobox genes highly related to the Bar
Drosophila genes, which they designated Barhl1 and Barhl2 (605212).
Bulfone et al. (2000) screened a human lambda genomic library and
identified a clone containing the last 2 exons of the BARHL1 gene. By
joining these 2 exons together, they obtained a partial BARHL1 sequence
(GenBank GENBANK AJ237816) containing the homeobox and stop codon. This
partial BARHL1 sequence and the corresponding mouse sequence share 99%
amino acid identity. The mouse Barhl1 gene is more highly homologous to
Drosophila BARH1 than is the murine Barx1 gene (603260). In situ
hybridization to mouse tissues at several developmental stages revealed
that Barhl1 is exclusively expressed in restricted domains of the
developing central nervous system, in particular the diencephalon and
rhombencephalon, where it is expressed in migrating cells giving rise to
the cerebellar external granular layer and to specific populations of
dorsal sensory interneurons of the spinal cord. The authors hypothesized
that Barhl1 function may be required for the generation of these
specific subtypes of neuronal progenitors.

Using serial analysis of gene expression, Poschl et al. (2011) found
that BARHL1 was highly expressed in human cerebellum, with little
expression in cortex or any peripheral tissue examined. RT-PCR detected
about 30-fold higher BARHL1 expression in developing cerebellum compared
with adult cerebellum. Immunohistochemical analysis of medulloblastomas
revealed nuclear BARHL1 expression. In postnatal day-7 mouse, Barhl1 was
strongly expressed in cerebellar granule neurons.

GENE FUNCTION

Poschl et al. (2011) found that expression of BARHL1 was elevated in
medulloblastoma compared with normal human cerebellar tissue. Knockdown
of Barhl1 expression reduced survival in mice engineered to develop
mutant Shh (600725)-dependent medulloblastomas. Loss or reduced BARHL1
expression in human medulloblastomas was weakly associated with reduced
tumor cell differentiation and poor survival.

MAPPING

By PCR analysis of the GeneBridge4 radiation hybrid panel, Bulfone et
al. (2000) assigned the human BARHL1 gene to chromosome 9q34. The mouse
Barhl1 gene resides in a region of chromosome 2 sharing homology of
synteny with human 9q34.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Bulfone et al. (2000) stated that the mapping assignment and the
expression pattern make BARHL1 a positional candidate gene for a form of
Joubert syndrome (213300), a rare developmental anomaly of the
cerebellum in humans. Blair et al. (2002) appeared to have excluded
BARHL1 as the site of the mutation in the form of Joubert syndrome that
is linked to 9q34.

Gould and Walter (2004) demonstrated no abnormality of the BARHL1 gene
or the BARX1 gene (603260) in Joubert syndrome.

606429	TITLE *606429 UDP-GLYCOSYLTRANSFERASE 1 FAMILY, POLYPEPTIDE A4; UGT1A4
;;UGT1D
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Enzymes of the UDP glycosyltransferase (UGT; EC 2.4.1.17) superfamily
covalently link glycosyl groups to lipophilic substrates. UGT1A enzymes,
such as UGT1A3, efficiently use UDP-glucuronic acid as the glycosyl
donor and are invaluable in detoxifying both endogenous and foreign
chemicals, because the glycosylated chemical is more water soluble and
therefore more readily excreted. Several UGT1A enzymes, including
UGT1A4, are encoded by the UGT1A gene complex on chromosome 2q37. Within
this complex, 9 viable first exons are independently spliced to 4 common
exons to generate 9 UGT1A transcripts with unique 5-prime ends and
identical 3-prime ends. UGT1A4, like each first exon within the UGT1A
gene complex, is considered a unique gene linked to the 4 common exons
(Gong et al., 2001; Mackenzie et al., 2005). See 191740 for further
information on the UGT1A gene complex.

CLONING

By screening a liver cDNA library with a probe to a conserved
transferase C-terminal sequence, followed by 5-prime RACE, Ritter et al.
(1991) obtained cDNAs encoding UGT1A1 (191740) and UGT1A4, which they
termed HUGBR1 and HUGBR2, respectively. The deduced 534-amino acid
UGT1A4 protein shares 66% sequence similarity with UGT1A1 in the N
terminus, which contains potential N-linked glycosylation sites, and
complete identity after codon 287. Northern blot analysis revealed
expression of a 2.6-kb transcript in liver. Unlike UGT1A1, expression of
UGT1A4 is normal in type I Crigler-Najjar syndrome (218800). Functional
analysis showed that UGT1A4 has glucuronidating activity although, in a
review of the UGTs, Tukey and Strassburg (2000) found that UGT1A4
activity with bilirubin is rather modest compared to that of UGT1A1.
UGT1A4 is relatively active with amines, steroids, and sapogenins. By
Northern blot analysis, Ritter et al. (1992) determined that UGT1A4,
then termed UGT1D, is expressed at lower levels than UGT1A1 in liver.

MAPPING

By Southern blot analysis, Ritter et al. (1992) determined that all of
the UGT1A genes map to the same locus on chromosome 2.

603775	TITLE *603775 CYCLIN E2; CCNE2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching an EST database with a cyclin box consensus sequence, Gudas
et al. (1999) identified rat and mouse cDNAs encoding cyclin E2. They
carried out additional EST database searches and performed RACE to
identify human cyclin E2 cDNAs. The predicted 404-amino acid cyclin E2
protein contains a cyclin box motif and is 47% identical to cyclin E1
(CCNE1; 123837). Northern blot analysis revealed that the 2.8-kb cyclin
E2 mRNA is expressed in several normal human tissues, with the highest
levels in testis, thymus, and brain. The level of cyclin E2 transcript
was consistently elevated in tumor-derived cells compared to
nontransformed proliferating cells. When expressed in mammalian cells,
epitope-tagged cyclin E2 protein localized to the nucleus. Gudas et al.
(1999) also isolated an alternatively spliced human cDNA encoded cyclin
E2(SV), a protein missing 45 amino acids within the cyclin box domain.
RNase protection assays confirmed that the cyclin E2(SV) mRNA is
expressed in normal human thymus.

Independently, both Zariwala et al. (1998) and Lauper et al. (1998)
isolated cyclin E2 cDNAs.

GENE FUNCTION

Cyclins bind to and activate cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) to form
serine/threonine kinase holoenzyme complexes that regulate the
eukaryotic cell cycle. Cyclins A (see 123835), D (see 123834), and E are
required for mammalian cells to traverse G1 and enter S phase. Cyclin E
controls the initiation of DNA synthesis by activating CDK2 (116953);
the KIP1 (600778) and CIP1 (116899) proteins bind and inhibit cyclin
E-CDK2 complexes. Gudas et al. (1999) found that, like cyclin E1, the
human cyclin E2 gene complemented a G1 cyclin defect in S. cerevisiae.
Cyclin E2 expressed in mammalian cells associated with CDK2 in a
functional kinase complex that was inhibited by both KIP1 and CIP1.
Gudas et al. (1999) demonstrated that the catalytic activity associated
with cyclin E2 complexes is cell cycle-regulated and peaks at the G1/S
transition. Overexpression of either cyclin E1 or cyclin E2 in mammalian
cells accelerated G1, indicating that, like cyclin E1, cyclin E2 may be
rate-limiting for G1 progression. The shorter cyclin E2(SV) isoform did
not bind CDK2. Gudas et al. (1999) concluded that multiple unique cyclin
E-CDK complexes may regulate cell cycle progression.

Zariwala et al. (1998) and Lauper et al. (1998) reported that cyclin E2
is a short-lived protein whose turnover appears to be governed by the
proteasome pathway. Zariwala et al. (1998) found that expression of
either of the papilloma virus E6 and E7 oncoproteins, which inactivate
p53 (191170) and Rb1 (614041), respectively, upregulates the expression
of cyclin E2. However, only E7 expression increased the steady-state
level of cyclin E1. These authors concluded that the 2 E-type cyclins
have distinct regulation mechanisms.

ANIMAL MODEL

Geng et al. (2003) created mice deficient in cyclin E1, cyclin E2, or
both. Cyclin E1-null mice were born at the expected mendelian ratio and
appeared normal throughout their lives, whereas cyclin E2-deficient
males had reduced fertility associated with reduced testicular size and
greatly reduced sperm counts. Double-knockout mice died prior to
embryonic day 11.5 and showed growth retardation, but no gross
abnormalities or pathologic lesions. Examination of extraembryonal
tissues revealed profoundly abnormal placentas, with severely impaired
endoreplication of trophoblast giant cells. Endoreplication in
double-knockout megakaryocytes was also severely impaired. Cyclin E-null
cells proliferated actively under conditions of continuous cell cycling,
but they were unable to reenter the cell cycle following G0 arrest.
Molecular analysis revealed that cells lacking cyclin E failed to
normally incorporate MCM proteins (see MCM2; 116945) into DNA
replication origins during G0 to S progression.

615407	TITLE *615407 ADP RIBOSYLATION FACTOR-LIKE 2-BINDING PROTEIN; ARL2BP
;;ARL2-BINDING PROTEIN;;
BINDER OF ARL2; BART
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ARL2BP localizes to the basal body of ciliated cells and has an
essential role in photoreceptor maintenance and function (Davidson et
al., 2013).

CLONING

By searching EST databases for sequences similar to bovine Bart,
followed by PCR, Sharer and Kahn (1999) cloned human ARL2BP, which they
called BART. The deduced 163-amino acid protein has a calculated
molecular mass of 18.8 kD. Northern blot analysis detected a BART
transcript of about 2.0 kb in all human tissue examined, with abundant
expression in heart, brain, and skeletal muscle. Lower expression was
present in placenta, kidney, and pancreas, and very low expression was
present in lung and liver. Western blot analysis detected highest
expression of mouse Bart in brain.

By immunohistochemical analysis, immunoelectron microscopy, and
transmission electron microscopy of mouse retina, Davidson et al. (2013)
found that Arl2bp localized to the basal body and cilium-associated
centriole of photoreceptors and the periciliary extension of the inner
segment. Immunohistochemical analysis of mouse fibroblasts and human
retina pigment epithelial cells confirmed localization of ARL2BP to the
basal body. In nasal epithelial cells, ARL2BP was enriched at the basal
body region beneath motile cilia.

GENE STRUCTURE

Davidson et al. (2013) determined that the ARL2BP gene contains 6 exons
and spans 8.51 kb.

MAPPING

Hartz (2013) mapped the ARL2BP gene to chromosome 16q13 based on an
alignment of the ARL2BP sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF126062) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

GENE FUNCTION

Using a GTPase overlay assay, Sharer and Kahn (1999) showed that human
BART bound ARL2 (601175)-GTP in a manner indistinguishable from bovine
brain Bart. BART bound to ARL2 with high affinity in a GTP-dependent
manner, but it did not function as a GTPase-activating factor for ARL2.
Sharer and Kahn (1999) concluded that BART is an immediate downstream
effector for ARL2.

Using small interfering RNA, Davidson et al. (2013) found that knockdown
of ARL2BP in human retina pigment epithelial cells reduced cilia length.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 3 affected sibs from a consanguineous family of Arab Muslim origin
segregating autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa with or without
situs inversus (615434), Davidson et al. (2013) identified homozygosity
for a splice site mutation in the ARL2BP gene (615407.0001) that
segregated with disease in the family and was not present in 100
ethnically matched controls, in the dbSNP or 1000 Genomes Project
databases, or in 12,996 control haplotypes from the NHLBI Exome Variant
Server. In addition, in a patient of European descent diagnosed with
both RP and primary ciliary dyskinesia (CILD5; 608647), they identified
homozygosity for a missense mutation in the ARL2BP gene (M45R;
615407.0002) as well as homozygosity for a splice site mutation in the
HYDIN gene (610812.0003).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
RETINITIS PIGMENTOSA WITH OR WITHOUT SITUS INVERSUS
ARL2BP, IVS2AS, G-C, -1

In 3 affected sibs from a consanguineous family of Arab Muslim origin
segregating autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa with or without
situs inversus (615434), Davidson et al. (2013) identified homozygosity
for a c.101-1G-C transversion at the splice acceptor site of intron 2 of
the ARL2BP gene. The mutation segregated with disease in the family and
was not present in 100 ethnically matched controls, in the dbSNP or 1000
Genomes Project databases, or in 12,996 control haplotypes from the
NHLBI Exome Variant Server. RT-PCR analysis of RNA from the 3 affected
sibs revealed that normally spliced ARL2BP transcript was absent; the 5
amplified products present were sequenced and found to represent
abnormal splicing events causing frameshifts resulting in premature
termination codons. Two of the affected sibs had full thoracic and
abdominal situs inversus, whereas the third sib had normal situs
composition (situs solitus).

.0002
RETINITIS PIGMENTOSA WITHOUT SITUS INVERSUS
ARL2BP, MET45ARG

In a 48-year-old man from a consanguineous family of European descent
who had been diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa (615434) as well as
primary ciliary dyskinesia (CILD5; 608647), Davidson et al. (2013)
identified homozygosity for a c.134T-G transversion in exon 3 of the
ARL2BP gene, resulting in a met45-to-arg (M45R) substitution at a
residue within a highly conserved region. The mutation segregated with
disease in the family and was not found in 192 ethnically matched
controls, in the dbSNP or 1000 Genomes Project databases, or in 12,996
control haplotypes from the NHLBI Exome Variant Server. The patient was
also homozygous for a splice site mutation in the HYDIN gene
(610812.0003). The patient noticed difficulties with night vision
beginning in his 20s and had progressive loss of peripheral vision and,
later, central vision as well. Electroretinography confirmed severe rod
and cone dysfunction. At 48 years of age, his visual acuities were 0.25
in the right eye and 0.50 in the left, and his visual fields were
constricted to 10 degrees; fundus examination revealed widespread
retinal degeneration with only sparse bone-spicule pigmentation.
Reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation studies showed that binding of mutant
ARL2BP to ARL2 (601175) was reduced by 90% compared to wildtype. In
addition, ARL2BP was distributed diffusely in the cytoplasm in patient
epithelial cells, rather than enriched in the basal body region beneath
motile cilia as in wildtype cells.

611689	TITLE *611689 OOCYTE-EXPRESSED PROTEIN, DOG, HOMOLOG OF; OOEP
;;KH HOMOLOGY DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 2; KHDC2;;
FLOPED, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF; FLOPED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching for genes similar to the 3 mouse Khdc1 genes, Pierre et al.
(2007) identified a family of related genes in eutharian mammals. In
human, this family includes KHDC1 (611688), DPPA5 (611111), OOEP, and
ECAT1 (611687). The proteins encoded by these genes contain an atypical
KH domain with amino acid changes at critical sites, suggesting that it
may not bind RNA like canonical KH domains.

GENE FUNCTION

Li et al. (2008) identified a subcortical maternal complex (SCMC) in
mouse that assembled during oocyte growth and was essential for zygotes
to progress beyond the first embryonic cell division. Within this large
complex, Floped, Mater (NRLP5; 609658), and Tle6 interacted with each
other, and Filia independently bound Mater. Although the transcripts
encoding these proteins were degraded during meiotic maturation and
ovulation, the SCMC persisted in the early embryo. The SCMC, which was
located in the subcortex of the egg, was excluded from regions of
cell-cell contact in the cleavage-stage embryo and segregated to the
outer cells of the morulae and blastocyst. Oocytes lacking Floped and/or
Mater were fertilized, but the embryos did not progress beyond the
cleavage stage of development, and female mice lacking Floped and/or
Mater were sterile.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Pierre et al. (2007) mapped the OOEP gene
to chromosome 6q13. In mouse, the Ooep gene maps to chromosome 9E1.

EVOLUTION

Pierre et al. (2007) identified a family of KHDC1-related genes,
including OOEP, in eutherian mammals, but not in fish, bird, or opossum.
These genes map to a single syntenic region in human, chimpanzee,
macaque, dog, and bovine, but a paracentric inversion separated the
genes in mouse and rat.

;;H1.0;;
H1-0 HISTONE;;
H1FV
DESCRIPTION For background information on histones, histone gene clusters, and the
H1 histone family, see HIST1H1A (142709).

CLONING

Doenecke and Tonjes (1986) cloned the human H1.0 gene.

Marzluff et al. (2002) noted that H1F0 is a replacement H1 histone whose
transcription is independent of DNA replication. Unlike the transcripts
for replication-dependent histones, transcripts for replacement
histones, including that for H1F0, are polyadenylated. Marzluff et al.
(2002) stated that H1F0 is expressed at high levels during terminal
differentiation.

GENE FUNCTION

See HIST1H1A (142709) for functional information on H1 histones.

MAPPING

By PCR analysis of chromosomal DNA from a panel of human/rodent somatic
cell hybrids, Albig et al. (1993) demonstrated that the H1.0 gene maps
to chromosome 22. By fluorescence in situ hybridization, they localized
the gene to 22q13.1. Thus, unlike the other H1 genes mapped by Albig et
al. (1993), H1.0 lies outside the histone gene cluster on chromosome 6.

By genomic sequence analysis, Marzluff et al. (2002) determined that
nearly all replication-dependent histone genes are clustered on
chromosomes 6p22-p21, 1q21, and 1q42. In contrast,
replication-independent histone genes, such as H1F0, lie outside of
these clusters.

;;SUPPRESSOR OF ACTIN 1; SAC1;;
KIAA0851
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By screening for cDNAs with the potential to encode large proteins
expressed in brain, Nagase et al. (2000) identified a cDNA encoding
SAC1, which they called KIAA0851, a 587-amino acid protein with 34%
sequence identity with the yeast RSD1 (recessive suppressor of secretory
defect) protein. RT-PCR detected expression of SAC1 in heart, brain,
lung, liver, kidney, pancreas, testis, and ovary, and less abundant
expression in skeletal muscle and spleen.

Kiss et al. (2001) cloned mouse Sac1 which encodes a protein sharing 95%
sequence identity with human SAC1. Both contain 2 transmembrane regions
and a leucine zipper pattern. Both are predicted to be cytoplasmic
proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. Northern blot analysis in mouse
showed high expression of a 4-kb transcript in brain, lung, liver, and
kidney. A lower level of expression was seen in spleen and skeletal
muscle, and no expression was observed in heart or testis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kiss et al. (2001) determined that the SAC1 gene contains 20 exons and
spans 55.7 kb. It has a large first intron of approximately 14 kb.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Kiss et al. (2001) mapped the SAC1 gene within a
250-kb putative tumor suppressor region on chromosome 3p21.3.

601437	TITLE *601437 Fc FRAGMENT OF IgG, RECEPTOR TRANSPORTER, ALPHA; FCGRT
;;IMMUNOGLOBULIN RECEPTOR, INTESTINAL, HEAVY CHAIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The intestinal epithelium of neonatal mice and rats expresses an Fc
receptor (FcRn) that mediates the selective uptake of immunoglobulin G
(IgG) in mothers' milk, thereby helping newborn animals to acquire
passive immunity. Kandil et al. (1996) noted that the IgG in the milk is
bound to FcRn at the apical surface of the intestinal epithelium, and
the resultant FcRn-IgG complexes are transcytosed across the epithelium.
At the basolateral surface of intestinal epithelial cells, IgG is
released from FcRn into blood or tissue fluids. FcRn is structurally
similar to the major histocompatibility complex class I molecule, which
presents antigenic peptides to T cells. Like the MHC class I molecule,
FcRn is made up of a heavy chain (approximately 48 kD) and
beta-2-microglobulin (109700; approximately 12 kD). Its heavy chain
shows approximately 35% amino acid sequence identity to that of a
typical MHC class I molecule. Furthermore, the genomic organizations of
the MHC class I and mouse FcRn heavy chain genes are similar in that the
signal peptide, the 3 extracellular domains, the transmembrane region,
and the cytoplasmic region are all encoded by separate exons. Story et
al. (1994) cloned a cDNA encoding the human gene and symbolized it FcRn.
Kandil et al. (1996) isolated human genomic clones for the gene
(symbolized FCGRT by them) using 2 murine Fcgrt probes. The exonic
sequences of the genomic clones are identical to the cDNA sequence
described by Story et al. (1994).

GENE FUNCTION

Plasma protein catabolism occurs in vascular endothelium by endocytotic
processing of plasma contents. Vascular endothelium is the most active
endocytic tissue in the body and the principal site for plasma protein
catabolism. Plasma proteins diffusing or transported into extravascular
sites are isolated from catabolism while extravascular. The receptor
encoded by the FCGRT gene, alternatively called the Brambell receptor,
the protection receptor, or the neonatal receptor, is located in
endosomes of vascular endothelial cells and selectively recycles IgG to
the cell surface, thus protecting IgG from lysosomal catabolism that is
the fate of other, nonprotected plasma proteins. In mice with knockout
of this receptor, the fractional catabolic rate for IgG may be
accelerated up to 10-fold relative to wildtype animals in which
protection is intact (Junghans and Anderson, 1996). This protection
mechanism is directly responsible for making IgG the longest lived of
all plasma proteins (Waldmann and Strober, 1969).

Junghans et al. (2001) postulated that long-range cis inactivation of
the FCGRT gene is responsible for hypercatabolism of IgG in myotonic
dystrophy (DM; 160900). The FCGRT gene is closely situated to the DMPK
gene (605377), which is mutant in DM.

MAPPING

Ahouse et al. (1993) found that the mouse FcRn heavy chain gene,
designated Fcgrt, maps to chromosome 7 and thus is not encoded by the
MHC. Kandil et al. (1996) showed by fluorescence in situ hybridization
that the human gene, FCGRT, maps to 19q13.3. Thus, like its mouse
counterpart, FCGRT is not encoded by the MHC.

ANIMAL MODEL

Akilesh et al. (2004) showed that mice lacking FcRn were resistant to
transient inflammatory arthritis induced in wildtype mice upon transfer
of serum from arthritic K/BxN mice, which are universally susceptible to
autoimmune arthritis due to pathogenic anti-GPI (172400) IgG antibodies.
K/BxN mice deficient in FcRn had significantly delayed onset of
arthritis or only intermittent ankle inflammation without arthritic
disease, and they had low anti-GPI antibody titers without high B-cell
levels in popliteal lymph nodes during the experimental period.
Heterozygote and sick homozygote mice had lymphocytes expressing the
B-cell maturation markes Prdm1 (603423) and Tnfrsf17 (109545), the Th2
cytokines IL1b (147720) and IL10 (124092), the chemokines Scya20 (CCL20;
601960) and Scya3 (CCL3; 182283), and Fcgr1 (146760). Treatment of mice
with high-dose intravenous Ig (IVIg) reduced or eliminated arthritis
dependent on the presence of Fcgr2 (146790) and/or FcRn. Akilesh et al.
(2004) concluded that these findings provide a rational basis for the
use of IVIg and suggested that FcRn is a potential therapeutic target
linking the initiation and effector phases of humoral autoimmune
disease.

In contrast to rodents, in humans FcRn is expressed in adults, in
placenta--where it serves to transport IgG from mother to fetus (Story
et al., 1994)--and in several absorptive epithelial tissues, including
the lung, kidney, and intestine. The expression of FcRn in absorptive
epithelia, coupled with the description by Dickinson et al. (1999) of
FcRn transport of IgG through human intestinal epithelial cells in
vitro, suggested to Bitonti et al. (2004) that FcRn might be exploited
for the delivery of therapeutic proteins by conjugation of the proteins
to an FcRn-binding ligand, such as the Fc fragment of IgG1, which would
allow their transport across the epithelium. Bitonti et al. (2004)
showed that FcRn-mediated transport is functional in the lung of
nonhuman primates and that this transport system can be used to deliver
erythropoietin (EPO; 133170) when it is conjugated to the Fc region of
IgG1. Erythropoietin is a hormone used to stimulate red blood cell
production but requiring chronic therapy with either intravenous or
subcutaneous injection, making an alternative noninvasive method of
delivery desirable. FcRn-dependent absorption was more efficient when
the EPO-Fc fusion protein was deposited predominantly in the upper and
central airways of the lung, where epithelial expression FcRn was most
prominently detected. The bioavailability of an EPO-Fc monomer when
delivered through the lung was approximately equal to that reported for
unconjugated EPO delivered subcutaneously in humans. These studies
showed that FcRn can be harnessed to noninvasively deliver bioactive
proteins into the systemic circulation in therapeutic quantities.

606106	TITLE *606106 SOLUTE CARRIER FAMILY 44, MEMBER 2; SLC44A2
;;CHOLINE TRANSPORTER-LIKE PROTEIN 2; CTL2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Choline, a major constituent of cell membranes, participates in the
synthesis of acetylcholine in cholinergic neurons. It is taken up with
high affinity at cholinergic nerve terminals in a sodium-dependent
manner. O'Regan et al. (2000) cloned CTL1, a suppressor for a yeast
choline transport mutation, from a Torpedo electric lobe yeast
expression library by functional complementation. By EST database
searching and PCR on a sarcoma cell line, they obtained cDNAs encoding
human CTL1 (606105), CTL2, and CTL4 (606107). The predicted 706-amino
acid CTL2 protein is 43% and 67% homologous to human CTL1 and CTL4,
respectively. The CTL proteins contain 10 transmembrane domains and 11
highly conserved cysteines, and they lack signal peptides.

MAPPING

By STS analysis, O'Regan et al. (2000) mapped the CTL2 gene to
chromosome 19p13.1.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) is a life-threatening
complication of blood transfusion. Severe TRALI is often due to
antibodies in blood components directed at human neutrophil
alloantigen-3a (HNA3a). Using serologic, flow cytometric, and
immunoprecipitation analyses of HNA3a-positive granulocytes together
with plasma containing HNA3a-specific antibodies, Greinacher et al.
(2010) identified an 80- to 100-kD protein that shifted to 64 kD after
deglycosylation. Peptide analysis identified the protein as SLC44A2.
Analysis of 54 individuals of known HNA3 phenotype revealed a 461A-G SNP
(dbSNP rs2288904), resulting in either gln or arg at residue 154, that
was fully concordant with HNA3 status. The 461G variant encodes arg154,
or HNA3a phenotype, whereas the 461A variant encodes gln154, or HNA3b
phenotype. The 461G variant was found in all 6 individuals who developed
TRALI after transfusion of HNA3a-specific alloantibody-containing blood
components. SNP array analysis suggested that approximately 95% of the
European population is either homozygous or heterozygous for 461G and is
therefore at risk for TRALI if transfused with anti-HNA3a-containing
products.

;;TRANSFORMING GROWTH FACTOR, BETA-INDUCED, 55-KD;;
ANDROGEN RECEPTOR COACTIVATOR; ARA55;;
HIC5
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using differential screening of a cDNA library constructed from mouse
osteoblastic cells (MC3T3-E1) treated with TGFB1 (190180), Shibanuma et
al. (1993) isolated several TGFB1-induced cDNAs. They stated that
hydrogen peroxide was released from MC3T3-E1 cells in response to TGFB1
and was partially responsible for the TGFB1 inhibition of growth.
Shibanuma et al. (1994) found that expression of one of these cDNAs was
induced by hydrogen peroxide as well as by TGFB1, and therefore they
designated this cDNA hic5 for 'hydrogen peroxide-inducible clone-5.' The
hic5 cDNA encodes a deduced 444-amino acid protein with 4 LIM motifs of
the zinc finger family.

Matsuya et al. (1998) cloned a human HIC5 cDNA from a hippocampus cDNA
library. Like the mouse Hic5 protein, the deduced human protein contains
444 amino acids with 4 LIM domains. They share 97% sequence identity in
the double zinc finger LIM domains and 84.3% in the N-terminal domains.
Both show sequence homology with the paxillin protein (602505). Matsuya
et al. (1998) determined that HIC5 localizes exclusively at focal
adhesions.

GENE FUNCTION

Shibanuma et al. (1994) found that expression of hic5 was extremely
reduced in several human tumor-derived cell lines and increased during
cellular senescence of normal human diploid fibroblasts. Shibanuma et
al. (1997) found that antisense hic5 expression in normal human diploid
fibroblasts delayed senescence.

By coimmunoprecipitation experiments, Matsuya et al. (1998) identified
interaction between TGFB1I1 and PYK2 (601212), a focal adhesion
protein-tyrosine kinase. By mutation analysis, they found that the
C-terminal region of PYK2 interacts with the N-terminal region of
TGFB1I1. Both proteins were tyrosine-phosphorylated in parallel in rat
fibroblasts exposed to hypertonic osmotic stress or stimulated with
lysophosphatidic acid. Fujimoto et al. (1999) found that TGFB1I1, which
they called ARA55, interacts with, and can enhance the transcriptional
activity of, the androgen receptor (AR; 313700) in a ligand-dependent
manner. Interaction was mediated by the C-terminal half of TGFB1I1
containing the LIM motifs.

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen, Drori et al. (2005) found that the
ligand-binding domain of mouse Pparg (601487) interacted with HIC5 in a
human colon cancer cDNA library. Hic5 and Pparg colocalized to the
villus epithelium of mouse small intestine, and their expression during
embryonic gut development correlated with the transition from endoderm
to specialized epithelium. Overexpression of HIC5 in colon cancer cells
enhanced PPARG-mediated induction of several gut epithelial
differentiation and maturation markers. Overexpression of HIC5 during
mouse preadipocyte differentiation inhibited adipogenesis while inducing
inappropriate expression of several mRNAs characteristic of gut
epithelium.

MAPPING

Using a somatic cell hybrid panel, Shibanuma et al. (1997) mapped the
TGFB1I1 gene to chromosome 16.

Mashimo et al. (2000) mapped the mouse Tgfb1i1 gene to chromosome 7
using FISH.

;;PEROXISOMAL MEMBRANE PROTEIN, 34-KD; PMP34
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SLC25A17 is a peroxisomal membrane protein that belongs to the family of
mitochondrial solute carriers.

CLONING

Using an EST with significant homology to the yeast C. boidinii
peroxisomal membrane protein as probe, Wylin et al. (1998) cloned
SLC25A17 from a human liver cDNA library. The deduced 307-amino acid
protein has a calculated molecular mass of 34.5 kD and contains 6
membrane-spanning regions. Wylin et al. (1998) deduced the mouse
sequence by database analysis and found that both the human and mouse
proteins share 33% identity with the yeast protein. By RT-PCR, using
primers specified for the mouse sequence, they identified a 233-bp
transcript in human liver and in all rat and mouse tissues examined. By
fluorescence microscopy of human hepatoma cells and mouse fibroblasts
transfected with a plasmid encoding a fluorescence-tagged fusion
protein, Wylin et al. (1998) found that the protein colocalizes with the
dimeric peroxisomal thiolase.

GENE STRUCTURE

Wylin et al. (1998) determined that the SLC25A17 gene contains 4 exons.

MAPPING

Wylin et al. (1998) mapped the SLC25A17 gene within a genomic clone
localized to chromosome 22q13.

164345	TITLE *164345 OLIGODENDROCYTE-MYELIN GLYCOPROTEIN; OMG
;;OMGP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

In the course of efforts to identify the gene mutated in
neurofibromatosis type I (NF1; 162200), Viskochil et al. (1991) found 3
genes embedded within an intron of the NF1 gene (613113). The cDNA
sequence of one of these genes encodes oligodendrocyte-myelin
glycoprotein (OMG).

GENE STRUCTURE

Viskochil et al. (1991) reported that the OMG gene spans at least 2.7 kb
of genomic DNA and maps within 4 kb of the breakpoint of a balanced
chromosomal translocation carried by an individual with NF1. OMG is
similar in genomic structure to 2 other expressed genes, EVI2A (158380)
and EVI2B (158381), which lie approximately 20 and 5 kb telomeric to the
OMG locus, respectively. All 3 genes have the same transcriptional
orientation and are contained within 1 intron of NF1, which is
transcribed from the opposite strand. Whether altered expression of OMG
plays a role in the clinical heterogeneity of NF1 remained to be
determined.

Mikol et al. (1990) found a single intron in the 5-prime untranslated
region of the OMG gene; the coding region was uninterrupted by an
intron. The placement of the single intron in the OMG gene is identical
to that in the gene for the alpha-chain of platelet glycoprotein Ib
(231200), which, along with OMG, belongs to a family of proteins sharing
2 distinct structural domains: an NH2-terminal cysteine-rich domain and
an adjacent domain of tandem leucine-rich repeats. No obvious promoter
elements were noted in the 5-prime and 3-prime flanking regions.

MAPPING

By hybridization of a genomic clone to metaphase cells, Mikol et al.
(1990) localized the OMG gene to 17q11-q12, the region to which the NF1
gene had previously been mapped. Mikol et al. (1993) showed that in the
mouse the OMGP gene has a single intron in the 5-prime untranslated
region in exactly the same position as the sole intron in the gene for
the human protein. The conservation of the nucleotide sequences of the
coding, noncoding, and flanking regions of the 2 genes was remarkable.
No mapping information in the mouse was provided.

GENE FUNCTION

Habib et al. (1998) reported that OMG, like neurofibromin (see NF1), has
growth suppressive effects and downregulates mitogenic signaling
pathways closely related to those influenced by neurofibromin.
Overexpression of OMG altered mitogenic signaling in fibroblasts. Cells
overexpressing OMG grew more slowly in serum compared to controls and
showed a partial G1 block upon cell cycle analysis. PDGF (e.g., 190040)
is the primary mitogen for fibroblasts in serum. Overexpression of OMG
altered PDGF signaling in fibroblasts, which resulted in a block of
mitogenic signaling. PDGF-induced activation of c-src (190090) was
blocked, as was the induction of c-myc (190080) and c-fos (164810),
while tyrosine phosphorylation of the PDGF-beta receptor (173410) and
PLC-gamma-1, and induction of c-jun (165160), were intact. Habib et al.
(1998) demonstrated that structurally unrelated products of 2 genes, 1
of which is embedded within the other, may exercise closely related
functions. Their data also raised the possibility of a role for OMG in
disorders of cell proliferation, such as NF1.

Wang et al. (2002) demonstrated that a glycosylphosphatidylinositol
(GPI)-anchored central nervous system (CNS) myelin protein,
oligodendrocyte-myelin glycoprotein (OMGP), is a potent inhibitor of
neurite outgrowth in cultured neurons. Like NOGOA (604475), OMGP
contributes significantly to the inhibitory activity associated with CNS
myelin. To further elucidate the mechanisms that mediate this inhibitory
activity, Wang et al. (2002) screened an expression library and
identified the NOGO receptor (NGR; 605566) as a high affinity
OMGP-binding protein. Cleavage of NOGO receptor and other GPI-linked
proteins from the cell surface renders axons of dorsal root ganglia
insensitive to OMGP. Introduction of exogenous NOGO receptor confers
OMGP responsiveness to otherwise insensitive neurons. Thus, OMGP is an
important inhibitor of neurite outgrowth that acts through the NOGO
receptor and its associated receptor complex. Wang et al. (2002)
suggested that interfering with the OMGP/NOGO receptor pathway may allow
lesioned axons to regenerate after injury in vivo.

Huang et al. (2005) showed that nodal membranes isolated from the CNS of
mammals restricted neurite outgrowth of cultured neurons. Proteomic
analysis of these membranes revealed several inhibitors of neurite
outgrowth, including OMGP. In rat spinal cord, Omgp was not localized to
compact myelin, as previously thought, but to oligodendroglia-like
cells, whose processes converge to form a ring that completely encircles
the nodes. In Omgp-null mice, CNS nodes were abnormally wide and
collateral sprouting was observed. Huang et al. (2005) concluded that
nodal ensheathment in the CNS may stabilize the node and prevent axonal
sprouting.

With the use of expression cloning, Atwal et al. (2008) found that
paired immunoglobulin-like receptor B (PIRB; 604820), which has been
implicated in nervous system plasticity, is a high-affinity receptor for
NOGO, MAG (159460), and OMGP. Interfering with PIRB activity, either
with antibodies or genetically, partially rescued neurite inhibition by
NOGO66, MAG, OMGP, and myelin in cultured neurons. Blocking both PIRB
and NGR activities led to near-complete release from myelin inhibition.
Atwal et al. (2008) concluded that their results implicated PIRB in
mediating regeneration block, identified PIRB as a potential target for
axon regeneration therapies, and provided an explanation for the similar
enhancements of visual system plasticity in PIRB and NGR knockout mice.
