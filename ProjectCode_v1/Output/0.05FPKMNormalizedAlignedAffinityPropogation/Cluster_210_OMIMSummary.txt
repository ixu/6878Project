;;H1 RNA; H1RNA
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

H1RNA is the RNA component of the RNase P ribonucleoprotein, an
endoribonuclease that cleaves tRNA precursor molecules to form the
mature 5-prime termini of their tRNA sequences (Baer et al., 1989).

CLONING

Bartkiewicz et al. (1989) purified RNase P from HeLa cell extracts and,
using this as template, synthesized and cloned H1RNA cDNA. The deduced
340-nucleotide transcript does not contain a 5-prime cap structure. The
5-prime and 3-prime termini are complementary, and the authors predicted
that they are hydrogen bonded.

Baer et al. (1989) cloned an H1RNA cDNA, including its flanking regions,
from human spleen DNA. In vitro transcription of H1RNA cDNA using S100
and whole HeLa cell extracts confirmed synthesis of a transcript
containing about 340 nucleotides. The mature form of H1RNA did not
appear to be derived from a larger precursor molecule. Inhibitor studies
indicated that H1RNA is transcribed by RNA polymerase (Pol) III (see
606007).

GENE FUNCTION

Following depletion of RNase P from HeLa cell extracts, Reiner et al.
(2006) found a severe deficiency in Pol III-mediated transcription of
tRNA and other small noncoding RNA genes. Targeted cleavage of the H1RNA
moiety of RNase P altered enzyme specificity and diminished Pol III
transcription. Similarly, inactivation of RNase P protein subunits, such
as RPP38 (606116), by small interfering RNA inhibited Pol III function
and Pol III-directed promoter activity in the cell. RNase P exerted its
role in transcription through association with Pol III and chromatin of
active tRNA and 5S rRNA (180420) genes. Reiner et al. (2006) concluded
that RNase P has a role in Pol III transcription and that transcription
and early tRNA processing may be coordinated.

GENE STRUCTURE

Baer et al. (1989) determined that the flanking regions of the H1RNA
gene contain transcriptional control elements characteristic of both RNA
polymerase II and RNA polymerase III.

Myslinski et al. (2001) analyzed the H1RNA promoter region using various
transcription assays on mutant templates and DNA binding assays with
recombinant proteins. They found that the DNA elements required for
H1RNA transcription are typical of vertebrate small nuclear RNA promoter
elements. However, the promoter is unusually compact and is contained
within 100 bp of 5-prime flanking sequences.

MAPPING

By Southern blot analyses, Bartkiewicz et al. (1989) determined that
there are no more than 3 H1RNA genes, and Baer et al. (1989) predicted
that there is only a single gene. Baer et al. (1989) mapped the H1RNA
gene to chromosome 14q just below the centromere by analyzing a panel of
mouse-human hybrid chromosomes and by in situ hybridization.

;;RNA, U108 SMALL NUCLEOLAR; RNU108;;
RNA, E2 SMALL NUCLEOLAR; RNE2;;
snoRNA, E2
DESCRIPTION See 180645. Several of the known small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) species
have been shown to be required for processing of ribosomal RNA (rRNA)
precursors. The genes of most of the known vertebrate snoRNA species are
located in introns of mRNA precursors (Maxwell and Fournier, 1995). E2
RNA is a nucleolar species that is 154-nucleotides long in the human.
Selvamurugan and Eliceiri (1995) stated that it belongs to a new family
of snoRNAs because it does not have the sequences named 'box C,'
'C-prime,' or 'D' that are present in most vertebrate snoRNA species,
and it does not bind fibrillarin (134795), the nucleolar protein
associated with most snoRNAs. E2 snoRNA is found in all tissues tested
in all vertebrates analyzed. Two observations are compatible with the
possibility that the human E2 RNA gene may be intronic. First, the human
gene lacks the intragenic flanking sequences that are functional in
other genes. Second, the 5-prime end of E2 RNA is monophosphorylated,
suggesting that it is formed by RNA processing. Intron-encoded snoRNAs
have monophosphorylated 5-prime termini. Selvamurugan and Eliceiri
(1995) demonstrated that the E2 gene resides in an intron of a
laminin-binding protein, the 67-kD laminin receptor (LAMR1; 150370).
Multiple copies (up to 16) of the LAMR1 gene per haploid genome are
present in the human.

CELL CYCLE PROGRESSION RESTORATION 2; CPR2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By screening a hepatoma cDNA expression library for clones that could
block mating pheromone-induced G1 arrest in yeast, Edwards et al. (1997)
cloned TBRG4, which they called CPR2. The deduced protein contains
multiple putative leucine zipper domains characteristic of transcription
factors.

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated human brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1999) cloned TBRG4, which they designated
KIAA0948. The transcript contains several repetitive elements in the
3-prime untranslated region. The deduced 521-amino acid protein shares
significant similarity with rat Cpr2. RT-PCR ELISA detected moderate
expression in ovary, and little to no expression in all other tissues
and specific brain regions examined.

MAPPING

By FISH, Edwards et al. (1997) mapped the TBRG4 gene to chromosome
7p14-p13.

MIRN181B2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MicroRNAs (miRNAs), such as MIR181B, are short noncoding RNAs that
repress translation or induce cleavage of target mRNAs with which they
interact (Ciafre et al., 2005). Two distinct genes, MIR181B1 (612744)
and MIR181B2, encode the same mature MIR181B miRNA.

GENE FUNCTION

Using microarray and Northern blot analyses, Ciafre et al. (2005) found
that expression of MIR181B was significantly downregulated in primary
glioblastomas and human glioblastoma cell lines compared with normal
brain tissue.

MAPPING

Hartz (2009) mapped the MIR181B2 gene to chromosome 9q33.3 based on an
alignment of the MIR181B2 stem-loop sequence
(CUGAUGGCUGCACUCAACAUUCAUUGCUGUCGGUGGGUUUGAGUCUGAAUCAACUCACUGAUCAAUGAAUG
CAAACUGCGGACCAAACA) with the genomic sequence (build 36.1).

603884	TITLE *603884 BCL2-ASSOCIATED ATHANOGENE 4; BAG4
;;SILENCER OF DEATH DOMAINS; SODD
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 (TNFR1; 191190) and several other
members of the TNF receptor superfamily, such as DR3 (603366), contain
intracellular death domains and are capable of triggering apoptosis when
activated by their respective ligands. However, TNFR1 self-associates
and signals independently of ligand when overexpressed. Jiang et al.
(1999) suggested the existence of a cellular mechanism to protect
against ligand-independent signaling by TNFR1 and other death domain
receptors. Using a yeast 2-hybrid assay with DR3 as bait, these authors
identified a cDNA encoding a protein that they designated 'silencer of
death domains' (SODD). The predicted 457-amino acid SODD protein
migrates as a doublet of 60 kD on Western blots of mammalian cell
extracts. Coimmunoprecipitation studies revealed that SODD is associated
with TNFR1 in vivo. TNF treatment of cells released SODD from TNFR1,
permitting the recruitment of proteins such as TRADD (603500) and TRAF2
(601895) to the active TNFR1 signaling complex. Jiang et al. (1999)
proposed that SODD is a negative regulatory protein that is normally
associated with the death domain of TNFR1, inhibiting the intrinsic
self-aggregation properties of the death domain and maintaining TNFR1 in
an inactive, monomeric state. This inhibition is relieved by
TNF-mediated receptor crosslinking, which triggers the rapid release of
SODD, allowing the death domains of TNFR1 to self-associate and bind
other proteins to form an active TNFR1 signaling complex. These authors
found that SODD also interacted with DR3 in yeast 2-hybrid assays,
suggesting that SODD association may be representative of a general
mechanism for preventing spontaneous signaling by death
domain-containing receptors.

BAG1 (601497) binds the ATPase domains of Hsp70 (see 140550) and Hsc70
(600816), modulating their chaperone activity. See BAG2 (603882).
Takayama et al. (1999) identified cDNAs corresponding to BAG4 and 3
other BAG1-like proteins. These authors suggested that interactions with
various BAG family proteins allow opportunities for specification and
diversification of Hsp70/Hsc70 chaperone functions.

GENE FUNCTION

Pancreatic cancer cells are resistant to TNFA-mediated apoptosis. By
Northern blot analysis, Ozawa et al. (2000) detected a 5-fold increased
expression of 3.5-kb SODD transcripts in pancreatic cancer cells and
pancreatic cancer cell lines compared with normal pancreatic cells.
Other gastrointestinal cancers (liver, esophagus, stomach, and colon)
showed no increased SODD expression. In situ hybridization analysis
revealed expression of SODD in the cytoplasm of cancer cells.

By array CGH, Yang et al. (2006) analyzed the copy number and expression
level of genes in the 8p12-p11 amplicon in 22 human breast cancer
(114480) specimens and 7 breast cancer cell lines. Of the 21 potential
genes identified, PCR analysis and functional analysis indicated that 3
genes, LSM1 (607281), BAG4, and C8ORF4 (607702), are breast cancer
oncogenes that can work in combination to influence a transformed
phenotype in human mammary epithelial cells.

MAPPING

The BAG4 gene resides on chromosome 8p11 (Yang et al., 2006).

600126	TITLE *600126 PHOSPHODIESTERASE 4A, cAMP-SPECIFIC; PDE4A
;;DUNCE-LIKE PHOSPHODIESTERASE E2, FORMERLY; DPDE2, FORMERLY
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Cyclic nucleotides are important second messengers that regulate and
mediate a number of cellular responses to extracellular signals, such as
hormones, light, and neurotransmitters. Cyclic nucleotide
phosphodiesterases (PDEs) regulate the cellular concentrations of cyclic
nucleotides and thereby play a role in signal transduction. PDE4A is a
class IV cAMP-specific PDE (summary by Milatovich et al., 1994).

CLONING

Livi et al. (1990) isolated a cDNA for a cAMP phosphodiesterase from
human monocytes. The deduced protein contains 686 amino acids. Northern
blot analysis detected a predominant transcript of about 4.8 kb in
primary human monocytes and placenta. Obernolte et al. (1993) identified
the monocyte clone as the homolog of rat Pde4a.

Using degenerate primers based on Drosophila dnc and rat Dpd to amplify
human Dpd orthologs, followed by low-stringency hybridization of a brain
cDNA library, Bolger et al. (1993) cloned full-length DPDE2, which they
called PDE46, and a possible splice variant. The major transcript
encodes a deduced 779-amino acid protein with 2 N-terminal domains that
share a high degree of conservation with other DPDE proteins, and a
C-terminal catalytic domain. Northern blot analysis detected a 4.5-kb
DPDE2 transcript in normal human temporal cortex. RNase protection
assays showed that DPDE2 was expressed in 6 of 7 cell lines examined.

The difference in sequence within the 5-prime region of the open reading
frame reported by Bolger et al. (1993) and Livi et al. (1990) was
examined by Sullivan et al. (1994), who confirmed the sequence reported
by Bolger et al. (1993).

Sullivan et al. (1998) characterized the first 'short' PDE4A isoenzyme.
Huston et al. (1996) had characterized the full-length human 'long'
PDE4A isoenzyme.

GENE FUNCTION

Bolger et al. (1993) confirmed that DPDE2 showed cAMP PDE activity,
which was inhibited by several cyclin nucleotide PDE inhibitors.

Wilson et al. (1994) characterized the PDE4A enzyme.

Growth hormone (GH; 139250) is an essential priming factor for the
differentiation of 3T3-F442A mouse preadipocytes into mature adipocytes.
MacKenzie et al. (1998) found that GH-mediated differentiation of
3T3-F442A cells was accompanied by increased cAMP phosphodiesterase
activity by a specific Pde4a isoform that they called Pde4a5. They
showed that activation of Pde4a5 countered GH-mediated differentiation
of 3T3-F442A cells. Activation of Pde4a5 was mediated by a
phosphorylation pathway involving Jak2 (147796), PI3 kinase (see
601232), and p70S6 (see 608938).

Vecsey et al. (2009) demonstrated that sleep deprivation selectively
impaired 3-prime, 5-prime-cAMP- and protein kinase A (PKA; see
176911)-dependent forms of synaptic plasticity in the mouse hippocampus,
reduced cAMP signaling, and increased activity and protein levels of
PDE4, an enzyme that degrades cAMP. Treatment of mice with
phosphodiesterase inhibitors rescued the sleep deprivation-induced
deficits in cAMP signaling, synaptic plasticity, and
hippocampus-dependent memory. Vecsey et al. (2009) concluded that their
findings demonstrated that brief sleep deprivation disrupts hippocampal
function by interfering with cAMP signaling through increased PDE4
activity.

GENE STRUCTURE

Sullivan et al. (1998) determined that the PDE4A gene spans 50 kb and
contains at least 17 exons.

MAPPING

Milatovich et al. (1994) assigned the PDE4A gene to human chromosome 19
by Southern analysis of somatic cell hybrid lines and to mouse
chromosome 9 by Southern analysis of recombinant inbred (RI) mouse
strains. Horton et al. (1995) confirmed the localization of PDE4A to
chromosome 19 by analysis of a human/hamster somatic cell hybrid panel.
Using fluorescence in situ hybridization, they regionalized the gene to
chromosome 19p13.2-q12.

Sullivan et al. (1998) determined that the PDE4A gene is 350 kb proximal
to TYK2 (176941) and 850 kb distal to LDLR (606945) on chromosome
19p13.2.

601271	TITLE *601271 GUANYLATE CYCLASE ACTIVATOR 2B; GUCA2B
;;UROGUANYLIN; UGN;;
GUANYLATE CYCLASE C ACTIVATING PEPTIDE II;;
GCAP II
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Uroguanylin and guanylin (GUCA2A; 139392), peptide homologs of the
bacterial heat-stable enterotoxins (e.g., the E. coli ST toxin; STa),
are endogenous activators of the guanylate cyclase-2C receptor (GUCY2C;
601330), which synthesizes cyclic GMP (cGMP), a key component of several
intracellular signal transduction pathways.

CLONING

- Peptide Isolation

Kita et al. (1994) searched for members of the guanylin-like family and
purified a 16-amino acid peptide, which they termed uroguanylin, from
human urine. The uroguanylin peptide shares amino acid sequence homology
with guanylin. By systematic isolation of circulating regulatory
peptides that generate cGMP as second messengers, Hess et al. (1995)
identified a 24-amino acid peptide with a molecular mass of 2.6 kD,
which they termed guanylate cyclase C activating peptide II (GCAP II),
and identified as the 'circulating form of uroguanylin.' The 16
C-terminal amino acids are identical to uroguanylin, and 8 of 13
C-terminal residues are conserved between GCAP II, uroguanylin, and E.
coli STa. By immunohistochemistry, Hess et al. (1995) showed that GCAP
II localized to enteroendocrine cells of colonic mucosa.

- Gene Isolation

Using human uroguanylin cDNA as a probe to screen a human genomic
library, Miyazato et al. (1997) isolated the gene for uroguanylin and
determined the full-length sequence, which encodes a deduced 112-amino
acid protein. The entire nucleotide sequence that corresponds to the 16
amino acid residues of mature uroguanylin is included in the third exon.
The GUCA2B gene also has multiple binding sites for the
promoter-specific transcription factors AP1 (165160) and AP2 (107580),
and a cAMP-regulated enhancer element. RNA blot analysis showed that the
human uroguanylin mRNA is expressed in the gastric fundus and pylorus,
as well as in the intestine.

Whitaker et al. (1997) cloned the mouse Guca2b gene (which the authors
referred to as Guca1b). In the mouse, uroguanylin mRNA is most prominent
in the proximal small intestine, whereas guanylin mRNA is predominantly
expressed in distal small intestine and colon. The upstream promoter
sequence of the mouse uroguanylin gene contains consensus binding sites
for several known transcription factors, including HNF1 (142410) and Sp1
(189906).

GENE STRUCTURE

Miyazato et al. (1997) determined that the human GUCA2B gene contains 3
exons.

Whitaker et al. (1997) found that the mouse uroguanylin and guanylin
genes are structurally similar, both being composed of 3 short exons.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Miyazato et al. (1997) mapped the
human GUCA2B gene to chromosome 1p34-p33.

Whitaker et al. (1997) demonstrated that the mouse Guca2b gene is
tightly linked to the guanylin gene on mouse chromosome 4.

GENE FUNCTION

Kita et al. (1994) found that synthetic uroguanylin increased cGMP
levels in T84 cells, competed for receptors with (125)I-labeled ST, and
stimulated chloride secretion. Kita et al. (1994) discussed the
bioactivity of human uroguanylin in light of their previous
investigation of uroguanylin from opossum urine (Hamra et al., 1993).

Whitaker et al. (1997) noted that uroguanylin is an endogenous ligand of
the intestinal receptor guanylate cyclase-C and stimulates an increase
in cGMP, inducing chloride secretion via the cystic fibrosis
transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR; 602421). Although their
structural homologies and similar bioactivities suggest that guanylin
and uroguanylin are members of the same peptide family, their tissue
gene expression patterns differ, indicating that they may have different
roles in the regulation of epithelial functions.

Kinoshita et al. (1997) found significantly higher urinary excretion of
uroguanylin in persons on a high-salt rather than a low-salt diet. In
addition, their concentration of plasma uroguanylin increased with
increasing serum creatinine, and the 10-kD precursor of uroguanylin
increased as the severity of renal impairment increased. The findings
suggested that uroguanylin is involved in the regulation of electrolyte
homeostasis by the kidney.

In a review of the functions of uroguanylin, Forte et al. (1996) noted
that uroguanylin receptors are present on the luminal surface of
epithelial cells lining the intestinal tract and renal proximal tubules,
leading to salt and water secretion into the intestinal lumen as well as
the renal tubules. Uroguanylin mRNA is also expressed in both atria and
ventricles of the heart. Since uroguanylin circulates in the plasma of
normal individuals, it may function as an intestinal natriuretic hormone
and its secretion may be influenced by dietary levels of salt.

EVOLUTION

Whitaker et al. (1997) speculated that uroguanylin and guanylin may
represent gene duplications that have evolved to allow overlapping and
complementary patterns of expression in the intestine.

ANIMAL MODEL

Lorenz et al. (2003) found that transgenic uroguanylin knockout mice had
in an impaired ability to excrete an enteral load of NaCl, primarily due
to an inappropriate increase in renal Na+ absorption. They also had an
increase in mean arterial blood pressure that was independent of the
level of dietary salt intake. The authors concluded that uroguanylin
plays a role in an enteric-renal communication axis in the maintenance
of salt homeostasis in vivo.
