;;JUMONJI DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 2B; JMJD2B;;
KIAA0876
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

KDM4B epigenetically regulates gene expression by demethylating
histone-3 (H3; see 602810) tri- and dimethylated lys9 (H3K9me3 and
H3K9me2, respectively), relaxing chromatin structure and permitting
access by transcription factors (Yang et al., 2010).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated human brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) cloned JMJD2B, which they designated
KIAA0876. The transcript contains an Alu element in its 3-prime UTR, and
the deduced 819-amino acid protein shares weak identity with peregrin
(BRPF2; 602410) over 432 amino acids. RT-PCR analysis detected high
JMJD2B expression in all tissues examined.

By searching for sequences similar to JMJD1C (604503), Katoh and Katoh
(2004) identified several JMJD2 family genes, including JMJD2B. JMJD2B
encodes a deduced 1,096-amino acid protein. Like JMJD2A (609764) and
JMJD2C (605469), JMJD2B contains a JmjN domain, a JmjC domain, a JD2H
domain, 2 TUDOR domains, and a bipartite nuclear localization signal
that overlaps the C-terminal part of the second TUDOR domain. JmjN is a
small domain found in the Jumonji family of transcription factors (see
601594). JmjC is a putative enzymatic domain. JD2H is a region
containing 2 cys-his clusters with weak similarity to a PHD domain.

GENE FUNCTION

Yang et al. (2010) found that the master regulator of oxygen
homeostasis, HIF1-alpha (HIF1A; 603348), upregulated JMJD2B expression.
Overexpression of JMJD2B erased global H3K9me3 marks on the promoters of
hypoxia-induced genes. Conversely, depletion of JMJD2B reduced
expression of hypoxia-specific genes. Estrogen receptor (ER)-alpha
(ESR1; 133430) was required for hypoxia-induced JMJD2B expression and
activity in ER-positive human breast cancer cells. Chromatin
immunoprecipitation analysis revealed direct binding of ER-alpha to
intron 1 of JMJD2B. JMJD2B expression was higher in ER-positive than
ER-negative breast cancers, and its expression was elevated by treatment
with 17-beta-estradiol (E2) and reduced following knockdown of ER-alpha
in ER-positive breast cancer cells. Knockdown of JMJD2B decreased cell
proliferation and colony formation, with significant G2-M phase arrest.
Yang et al. (2010) concluded that HIF1-alpha and ER-alpha may
synergistically regulate JMJD2B activity in the hypoxic environment of
tumor tissue.

MAPPING

Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the JMJD2B gene to chromosome 19 using
radiation hybrid analysis. By genomic sequence analysis, Katoh and Katoh
(2004) mapped the JMJD2B gene (KDM4B) to chromosome 19p13.3.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The MAP kinase (MAPK) cascades constitute functional units that couple
upstream input signals to a variety of outputs through pathways that
involve 3 protein kinases. MAPKKK (MAP3K; see 602448) phosphorylates
MAPKK (MAP2K; see 176872), which in turn phosphorylates and activates
MAPK (see 176948). MAP3K7, a member of the MAPKKK family, has been
linked to interleukin-1 receptor (see IL1R1; 147810) and tumor necrosis
factor receptor (see TNFRSF1A; 191190) signaling (Yamaguchi et al.,
1995; Sato et al., 2005)

CLONING

One MAPK pathway in S. cerevisiae controls the response to mating
pheromone. Yamaguchi et al. (1995) screened a mouse cDNA library for
clones that could act as MAPKKKs, suppressing a defect in the mating
pheromone response pathway. They identified a cDNA that encodes a
predicted 579-amino acid protein, which they named Tak1. Tak1 has a
putative N-terminal protein kinase domain.

Kondo et al. (1998) identified human ESTs that were homologous to mouse
Tak1 and used the resulting sequence information to clone human TAK1
from lung cDNA. The predicted 579-amino acid human TAK1 protein is 99%
identical to the mouse Tak1 protein. On Northern blots, TAK1 was
expressed as a 3-kb mRNA in all tissues tested. Kondo et al. (1998)
found 2 isoforms of TAK1 that differed by an insertion of 27 amino acids
after amino acid 403.

Independently, Sakurai et al. (1998) cloned a cDNA for TAK1 as well as 2
alternatively spliced isoforms, which they designated TAK1b (606 amino
acids) and TAK1c (567 amino acids). Northern blot analysis revealed
ubiquitous expression of 3.2- and 5.7-kb transcripts.

By amplifying the alternatively spliced region of TAK1, Dempsey et al.
(2000) identified a fourth, shorter variant of TAK1 called TAK1d. The
TAK1d variant lacks both alternative exons and encodes a 491-amino acid
protein. RT-PCR analysis showed that TAK1c is ubiquitously expressed and
predominates in prostate; TAK1a is the preferred form in most tissues
tested; TAK1b is preferred in brain, kidney, lung, and small intestine;
and TAK1d is present in most tissues as a minor variant. Dempsey et al.
(2000) concluded that the variations in the C-terminal ends (in TAK1c
and TAK1d) are unlikely to interfere with the catalytic activity of TAK1
or its interaction with TAB1 (602615), both of which involve the N
terminus, but may change the interaction of TAK1 with the TAB2 (605101)
adaptor protein.

GENE FUNCTION

Yamaguchi et al. (1995) found that Tak1 regulated transcription by
transforming growth factor-beta (TGFB; 190180) in mammalian cells. Only
Tak1 protein missing the N-terminal 22 amino acids could suppress a
yeast defect in the mating pheromone response pathway. This activated
form also signaled in the absence of TGFB in mammalian cells.

Using supershift analysis, Sakurai et al. (1998) determined that all 3
isoforms of TAK1 could induce translocation of NFKB, composed of the
p50/p65 heterodimer (see 164011 and 164014), to the nucleus, accompanied
by the degradation of IKBA (NFKBIA; 164008) and IKBB (NFKBIB; 604495) in
a NIK (604655)-independent manner.

Dempsey et al. (2000) noted that TGFB activation of TAK1 results in the
activation of SAPK1 (JNK1; 601158) and SAPK2 (MAPK14; 600289) through
the phosphorylation of MKK3 (602315), MKK4 (601335), and MKK6 (601254).

TRAF6 (602355)-regulated I-kappa-B kinase (IKK; see IKKB, 603258)
activator-2 (TRIKA2) activity is defined as the stimulation of IKK in
the presence of TRAF6 and the UBC13 (603679)-UBE2V1 (602995) complex
(TRIKA1). By sequential chromatographic purification and immunoblot
analysis, Wang et al. (2001) identified TAK1, together with its binding
partners TAB1 and TAB2, as the protein that copurifies with TRIKA2
activity. Mutation analysis showed that the TAK1 ATP-binding domain,
which mediates kinase activity and contains a lysine at position 63, is
essential for TRIKA2 function. Upon activation by UBC13-UBE2V1-mediated
ubiquitination, TAK1 phosphorylates IKKB at ser177 and ser181.
Ubiquitin-activated TAK1 also phosphorylates MKK6 (601254) at ser207 and
thr211, thereby allowing MKK6 to stimulate the kinase activity of JNK.
Inhibition of polyubiquitination abolishes the activation of JNK and IKK
by TRAF6. Mutation analysis showed that lys63 of ubiquitin (191339) is
necessary and sufficient for the activation of TAK1. Wang et al. (2001)
proposed that TAK1, when activated by ubiquitinated TRAF6 that has bound
to TAB2 after the translocation of TAB2 from the membrane to the
cytoplasm, is an IKK kinase. Furthermore, they suggested that
lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains may provide a kinase-independent
mechanism for the activation of the initial kinase in stress kinase
pathways.

Li et al. (2003) found that ectopic expression of mouse Pp2ce (PPM1L;
611931) in HEK293 human embryonic kidney cells inhibited IL1 (see
147760)- and TAK1-induced activation of the MKK4/JNK or MKK3/p38
(MAPK14) signaling pathways. Pp2ce dephosphorylated TAK1 in vitro.
Coimmunoprecipitation experiments revealed that Pp2ce associated stably
with TAK1 and attenuated binding of TAK1 to MKK4 or MKK6. A
phosphatase-negative Pp2ce mutant acted as a dominant-negative form and
enhanced both association of TAK1 with MKK4 or MKK6 and TAK1-induced
activation of an AP1 (165160) reporter gene. The association between
Pp2ce and TAK1 was transiently suppressed by IL1 treatment. Li et al.
(2003) concluded that, in the absence of IL1 signaling, PP2CE
inactivates the TAK1 signaling pathway by associating with and
dephosphorylating TAK1.

By reconstituting TAK1 activation in vitro using purified proteins, Xia
et al. (2009) demonstrated that free Lys63 polyubiquitin chains, which
are not conjugated to any target protein, directly activate TAK1 by
binding to the ubiquitin receptor TAB2 (also known as MAP3K7IP2;
605101). This binding leads to autophosphorylation and activation of
TAK1. Furthermore, Xia et al. (2009) found that unanchored polyubiquitin
chains synthesized by TRAF6 (602355) and UBCH5C (also known as UBE2D3,
602963) activate the IKK (see 600664) complex. Disassembly of the
polyubiquitin chains by deubiquitination enzymes prevented TAK1 and IKK
activation. Xia et al. (2009) concluded that unanchored polyubiquitin
chains directly activate TAK1 and IKK, suggesting a new mechanism of
protein kinase regulation.

HuangFu et al. (2006) stated that TAK1 is activated by physical and
chemical stress as well as by proinflammatory cytokines, and that
osmotic stress is a potent TAK1 activator in HEK293 cells and mouse
embryonic fibroblasts. In these cells, HuangFu et al. (2006) found that
osmotic stress led to TAK1-induced activation of JNK, but not activation
of NFKB. Yeast 2-hybrid analysis revealed TAK1 interacted with TAO1
(TAOK1; 610266) and TAO2 (TAOK2; 613199), and had higher affinity for
TAO2. TAO2 enhanced TAK1-mediated activation of JNK, but blocked the
interaction of TAK1 with the IKK complex, thereby inhibiting TAK1
activation of NFKB. Small interfering RNA directed against TAO2 reduced
osmotic stress-induced JNK activation, but had no effect on osmotic
stress-induced TAK1 activation. HuangFu et al. (2006) concluded that
TAO2 and TAK1 act in parallel pathways leading to osmotic stress-induced
JNK activation.

Using mass spectrometry, Wang et al. (2008) identified MAP3K7 as a
component of the ADA2A (TADA2A; 602276)-containing (ATAC) histone
acetyltransferase complex in HeLa cells.

Pertel et al. (2011) demonstrated that TRIM5 (608487) promotes innate
immune signaling and that this activity is amplified by retroviral
infection and interaction with the capsid lattice. Acting with the
heterodimeric ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC13-UEV1A, TRIM5 catalyzes
the synthesis of unattached K63-linked ubiquitin chains that activate
the TAK1 kinase complex and stimulate AP1 and NF-kappa-B (see 164011)
signaling. Interaction with the HIV-1 capsid lattice greatly enhanced
the UBC13-UEV1A-dependent E3 activity of TRIM5, and challenge with
retroviruses induced the transcription of AP1- and NF-kappa-B-dependent
factors with a magnitude that tracked with TRIM5 avidity for the
invading capsid. Finally, TAK1 and UBC13-UEV1A contribute to
capsid-specific restriction by TRIM5. Pertel et al. (2011) concluded
that the retroviral restriction factor TRIM5 has 2 additional activities
that are linked to restriction: it constitutively promotes innate immune
signaling, and it acts as a pattern recognition receptor specific for
the retrovirus capsid lattice.

Yu et al. (2012) adapted a microfluidic device for efficient capture of
circulating tumor cells from an endogenous mouse pancreatic cancer model
and subjected these cells to single-molecule RNA sequencing, identifying
Wnt2 (147870) as a candidate gene enriched in circulating tumor cells.
Expression of WNT2 in pancreatic cancer cells suppressed anoikis,
enhanced anchorage-independent sphere formation, and increased
metastatic propensity in vivo. This effect was correlated with
fibronectin (135600) upregulation and suppressed by inhibition of
MAP3K7. In humans, formation of nonadherent tumor spheres by pancreatic
cancer cells was associated with upregulation of multiple WNT genes, and
pancreatic circulating tumor cells revealed enrichment for WNT signaling
in 5 of 11 cases.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Dempsey et al. (2000) determined that the
MAP3K7 gene contains 17 exons spanning 71 kb and that the alternative
exons correspond to exons 12 and 16. Promoter analysis indicated the
lack of a TATA box and the presence of a CpG island in a GC-rich region,
suggesting that TAK1 is a housekeeping gene.

MAPPING

Kondo et al. (1998) used PCR of hybrid cell panels to link MAP3K7 to 2
markers that are included within a YAC from region 6q14-q21. Dempsey et
al. (2000) refined the localization to 6q16.1-q16.3 by analysis of BAC
clones (GenBank GENBANK AL121964 and GENBANK AL121837).

ANIMAL MODEL

Sato et al. (2005) found that Tak1 deficiency resulted in early
embryonic death in mice. They generated Tak1 -/- fibroblasts and showed
that Tak1 was required for Il1b (147720)- and Tnf (191160)-induced Nfkb
and Jnk activation, as well as cytokine production. B cell-specific
deletion of Tak1 led to impaired activation in response to TLR (e.g.,
TLR9; 605474) ligands and B-cell receptor stimulation, probably due to
lack of interaction with Bcl10 (603517). Sato et al. (2005) concluded
that TAK1 has nonredundant functions in signaling pathways in
inflammatory and immune responses.

Liu et al. (2006) targeted Tak1 deletion to T cells in mice and found
that Tak1 was essential for thymocyte development and activation.
Deletion of Tak1 prevented maturation of single-positive thymocytes
displaying Cd4 (186940) or Cd8 (see 186910), leading to reduction of T
cells in the peripheral tissues. Thymocytes lacking Tak1 failed to
activate Nfkb and Jnk and were prone to apoptosis upon stimulation. Liu
et al. (2006) concluded that TAK1 is required for activation of NFKB in
thymocytes and that TAK1 plays a central role in both innate and
adaptive immunity.

613141	TITLE *613141 DELTEX, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, 2; DTX2
;;KIAA1528
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

DTX2 functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase (Takeyama et al., 2003).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned DTX2, which they designated
KIAA1528. The deduced 740-amino acid protein shares a high degree of
similarity with human DTX1 (602582). RT-PCR ELISA detected DTX3
expression in all tissues and specific brain regions examined, with
highest expression in lung, liver, spleen, testis, and thalamus.

Takeyama et al. (2003) cloned 2 splice variants of DTX2, which they
called DTX2A and DTX2B. The deduced full-length DTX2A protein contains
622 amino acids and has an N-terminal domain predicted to associate with
Notch (see 190198) ankyrin repeats, followed by a proline-rich region
with potential Src (190090) homology-3 (SH3) domain-binding sites and a
C-terminal domain that includes a classic RING-H2 finger motif. Compared
with DTX2A, DTX2B lacks part of the proline-rich region.

GENE FUNCTION

Using an in vitro ubiquitination assay, Takeyama et al. (2003) showed
that recombinant DTX2 functioned as a ubiquitin E3 ligase. It showed
highest ubiquitination activity in conjunction with the E2 enzyme UBCH5A
(UBE2D1; 602961).

GENE STRUCTURE

Takeyama et al. (2003) determined that the DTX2 gene contains 9 exons.
Exon 4 is skipped in the DTX2B splice variant.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (2000) mapped the DTX2 gene
to chromosome 7.

;;MAGE11
DESCRIPTION The MAGEA family consists of 12 genes (MAGEA1 to MAGEA12), of which 6,
MAGEA1 (300016), MAGEA2 (300173), MAGEA3 (300174), MAGEA4 (300175),
MAGEA6 (300176), and MAGEA12 (300177), are expressed in melanomas and
other cancers. For further background information on the MAGEA family,
see 300016.

CLONING

De Plaen et al. (1994) identified the 12 MAGEA genes. MAGEA11 appeared
to be a weakly expressed member of the family.

MAPPING

By analysis of cell hybrids, ordered YACs, and cosmids, Rogner et al.
(1995) localized the MAGEA cluster to Xq28. They showed that the 12
genes are arranged in 3 clusters within 3.5 Mb.

See 300016 for a discussion of the high frequency of genes on the X
chromosome encoding proteins with the MAGE domain as well as other
cancer-testis antigen genes (Ross et al., 2005).

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using differential hybridization to identify transcripts upregulated by
retinoic acid in human tracheobronchial epithelial cells, followed by
5-prime primer extension, Soref et al. (2001) cloned DHRS9, which they
called RDHTBE. The deduced 319-amino acid protein has a calculated
molecular mass of 35 kD. DHRS9 contains 4 motifs conserved in most
short-chain alcohol dehydrogenase/reductase family members. Northern
blot analysis of primate tissues detected DHRS9 in trachea, colon,
tongue, and esophagus, but not in heart, kidney, liver, lung, stomach,
small intestine, or spleen. In situ hybridization and
immunohistochemical staining localized DHRS9 to ciliated cells in
surface epithelium in primate airway and lung and in superficial layers
of human esophagus.

By searching databases for sequences similar to RDH16, followed by PCR
of liver and heart and 5-prime RACE, Chetyrkin et al. (2001) cloned
DHRS9, which they designated 3-alpha-HSD. Northern blot analysis
detected tissue-specific expression of 3 DHRS9 transcripts. Highest
overall expression was detected in trachea, followed by spinal cord,
bone marrow, heart, and colon. Weaker expression was detected in lymph
node, brain, lung, placenta, testis, prostate, and mammary gland.
Protease and detergent treatment of DHRS9 expressed in vitro or in
insect cells showed that it was an integral membrane protein facing the
cytosolic side of microsomal membranes.

GENE FUNCTION

Soref et al. (2001) showed that all-trans-retinoic acid and
9-cis-retinoic acid induced DHRS9 mRNA and protein expression in human
tracheobronchial epithelial cells in a dose-dependent manner. Elevated
DHRS9 expression in these cells and in transfected COS cells resulted in
enhanced retinol metabolism.

Chetyrkin et al. (2001) showed that insect cell microsomes expressing
recombinant human DHRS9 exhibited oxidoreductase activity toward
hydroxysteroids, with NAD+ and NADH as the preferred cofactors. It was
most efficient as a 3-alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, converting
3-alpha-tetrahydroprogesterone to dihydroprogesterone and
3-alpha-androstanediol to dihydrotestosterone with similar catalytic
efficiency. DHRS9 showed much lower activity toward retinol substrates.

Using microarray and RT-PCR analyses, Jette et al. (2004) found that
expression of 2 retinoid biosynthesis genes, RDH5 (601617) and RDHL, was
reduced in colon adenomas and carcinomas compared with normal controls.
Reintroduction of wildtype APC (611731) into an APC-deficient colon
carcinoma cell line increased expression of RDHL without affecting RDH5.
Induction of RDHL by APC appeared to depend on the presence of CDX2
(600297).

GENE STRUCTURE

Chetyrkin et al. (2001) determined that the DHRS9 gene contains 5 exons
and spans more than 26 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Chetyrkin et al. (2001) mapped the DHRS9
gene to chromosome 2q31.1.

;;C/EBP-DELTA;;
CRP3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CEPD belongs to the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein family of
transcription factors, which are characterized by a basic DNA-binding
domain linked to heptad leucine repeats that mediate dimerization
(Cleutjens et al., 1993).

CLONING

Using PCR, Cleutjens et al. (1993) isolated a cDNA homologous to mouse
C/EBP-delta (CRP3) and rat Celf from a prostate cDNA library. The
deduced protein contains 269 amino acids. A genomic clone containing the
entire human CEBPD gene was isolated using a cDNA fragment as a probe.

GENE FUNCTION

Menard et al. (2002) showed that Cebpd was expressed in mouse cortical
progenitor cells. Cebpd induced expression of a reporter gene containing
the minimal promoter of alpha-tubulin (TUBA1A; 602529), a
neuron-specific gene.

Corneal stem cells are segregated in the basal layer of the limbus,
which is the vascularized zone encircling the cornea and separating it
from the bulbar conjuctiva. Barbaro et al. (2007) found that CEBPD, BMI1
(164831), and an isoform of p63 (TP63; 603273) called delta-N p63-alpha
were expressed in quiescent human corneal limbal stem cells in vivo and
in limbal holoclone-forming cells in vitro. Expression of CEBPD was
restricted to a subset of delta-N p63-alpha-positive cells that were
mitotically quiescent both in vivo and in vitro. Upon corneal injury, a
fraction of these cells switched off CEBPD and BMI1 and proliferated and
differentiated into mature corneal cells. Forced CEBPD expression
inhibited growth of limbal colonies and increased the cell cycle length
by activating p27(KIP1) (CDKN1B; 600778) and p57(KIP2) (CDKN1C; 600856).
CEBPD, but not delta-N p63-alpha, indefinitely promoted holoclone
self-renewal and prevented clonal evolution, suggesting that
self-renewal and proliferation in limbal stem cells are distinct, but
related, processes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed the
CEBPD was recruited to intron 3 of the TP63 gene and to regions upstream
of the involucrin (IVL; 147360), p27(KIP1), p57(KIP2), and p16(INK4A)
(CDKN2A; 600160) promoters. Barbaro et al. (2007) concluded that CEBPD
plays a key role in regulating the cell cycle and self-renewal
properties of human corneal limbal stem cells. They proposed that CEBPD
induces mitotic quiescence through p27(KIP1) and p57(KIP2) and preserves
proliferative potential through regulation of delta-N p63-alpha.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Cleutjens et al. (1993) assigned
the CEBPD gene to 8q11. The chromosomal localization was confirmed by
analysis of a panel of human/hamster somatic cell hybrid DNA samples
containing various portions of chromosome 8 with a CEBPD-specific STS.
They positioned the CEBPD gene between the gene for tissue plasminogen
activator (173370) and the MOS oncogene (190060). The murine gene is
located on mouse chromosome 16 (cited by Williams et al., 1991).

Kirchgessner et al. (1995) established a synteny group between human
8q11, containing the gene for the p350 subunit of DNA-activated protein
kinase (600899) and the CEBPD gene, and the centromeric region of mouse
chromosome 16.

By interspecific backcross analysis, Jenkins et al. (1995) demonstrated
that the Cebpd gene maps to mouse chromosome 16. The assignment to mouse
chromosome 16 defines a new region of homology with human chromosome 8.
By cell hybrid and fluorescence in situ hybridization mapping, Wood et
al. (1995) placed both CEBPD and FGFR1 (136350) within the chromosome
region 8p11.2-p11.1.

ANIMAL MODEL

Gigliotti et al. (2003) stated that Cebpd deletion in mice leads to
relatively subtle abnormalities, including slightly impaired adipocyte
differentiation, and to learning and memory alterations that enhance
contextual fear-conditioned responses. They found that adult nulliparous
Cebpd -/- female mice exhibited excessive mammary ductal branching and
increased total mammary epithelium compared with nulliparous wildtype
females. These changes resulted from increased proliferation of mammary
epithelial cells during the normal estrous cycle. Reproduction,
lactation, and mammary gland involution were essentially normal in Cebpd
-/- females.

Thangaraju et al. (2006) found that renal expression of the
Na(+)/lactate cotransporters Slc5a8 (608044) and Slc5a12 (612455) was
reduced in Cebpd +/- mice and was almost completely ablated in Cebpd -/-
mice. Expression of other renal transporters, including the uric acid
transporter Urat1 (SLC22A12; 607096), remained normal in Cebpd -/- mice,
and expression of Slc5a8 and Slc5a12 in brain and intestine was
unaffected by Cebpd deletion. Reporter gene assays using the promoter
region of human SLC5A8 and SLC5A12 confirmed that CEBPD induced
expression of these transporters.

;;POLY(A)-BINDING PROTEIN-INTERACTING PROTEIN 2;;
PABP-INTERACTING PROTEIN 2;;
PAIP2A
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By Far Western interaction cloning using human PABP (604679) as the
probe and a placenta cDNA expression library, Khaleghpour et al. (2001)
isolated a 1.4-kb cDNA encoding PAIP2. The highly acidic (predicted pI
of 3.9), 127-amino acid protein has a predicted molecular mass of 14.5
kD and acts as a repressor of translation both in vitro and in vivo.

GENE FUNCTION

Khaleghpour et al. (2001) found that PAIP2 preferentially inhibited
translation of a poly(A)-containing mRNA but had no effect on the
translation of hepatitis C virus mRNA, which is cap and eIF4G (see
600495) independent. The authors showed that PAIP2 decreases the
affinity of PABP for poly(A) RNA and disrupts the repeating structure of
poly(A) ribonucleoprotein. Furthermore, PAIP2 was found to compete with
PAIP1 (605184) for PABP binding. Thus, Khaleghpour et al. (2001)
concluded that PAIP2 inhibits translation by interdicting PABP function.

Using the 3-prime UTR of rat Vegf to probe a human colon carcinoma cell
line cDNA expression library, Onesto et al. (2004) identified PAIP2 as a
putative regulator of VEGF (192240) expression. They demonstrated that
PAIP2 stabilized VEGF mRNA, leading to increased VEGF expression. By in
vitro protein-protein interactions and coimmunoprecipitation
experiments, Onesto et al. (2004) showed that PAIP2 interacted with
another VEGF mRNA-binding protein, HuR (ELAVL1; 603466), suggesting that
PAIP2 and ELAVL1 cooperate to stabilize VEGF mRNA.

MAPPING

Scott (2001) mapped the PAIP2 gene to chromosome 5 based on sequence
similarity between the PAIP2 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF317675) and a
chromosome 5 clone (GenBank GENBANK AL136640).

CLONING

Levedakou et al. (1994) used degenerate PCR to clone a novel
serine/threonine protein kinase, termed STK2, from a human breast
carcinoma cell line. The gene encodes an 841-amino acid polypeptide.
Northern blot analysis revealed that the STK2 gene is expressed as 2
mRNAs of 4.0 kb and 6.8 kb in heart and several other tissues. Levedakou
et al. (1994) noted that levels of STK2 mRNA remain invariant throughout
the cell cycle.

;;TSG
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Oelgeschlager et al. (2000) isolated a full-length Tsg cDNA by using a
human EST to probe a Xenopus gastrula library. The cDNA encodes a
protein sharing 41% amino acid identity with Drosophila Tsg, 89%
identity with the partial human Tsg sequence, and 94% identity with a
mouse EST. The Tsg sequence contains a signal peptide, as expected for a
secreted protein, and 2 conserved domains containing multiple cysteines
at its amino and carboxy termini. Whole-mount in situ hybridization and
RT-PCR showed that abundant Tsg maternal transcripts are distributed
throughout the animal half of the embryo during cleavage stages. At the
late gastrula stage, maternal transcripts decrease and zygotic
transcripts appear, specifically in the ventral region of the embryo.
Tsg has ventralizing activity and is a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)
binding protein. The N-terminal domain of Tsg is sufficient to interact
with BMP4 (112262) but not with chordin (603475). Tsg competes for
binding of BMP4 with the first cysteine-rich domain of chordin (CR1) but
not with full-length chordin. Endogenous Tsg antagonizes CR1 activity.

Scott et al. (2001) obtained full-length sequences from human TSG.

Chang et al. (2001) independently identified vertebrate Tsg homologs.

GENE FUNCTION

Dorsal-ventral patterning in vertebrate and Drosophila embryos requires
a conserved system of extracellular proteins to generate a positional
information gradient. The components involved include BMPs, chordin (a
BMP antagonist), and a secreted metalloproteinase (Xolloid/Tolloid;
112264) that cleaves chordin. Oelgeschlager et al. (2000) described
Xenopus 'twisted gastrulation' (Tsg), another member of this signaling
pathway. Tsg is expressed ventrally as part of the BMP4 group and
encodes a secreted BMP-binding protein that is a BMP signaling agonist.
The data suggested a molecular mechanism by which Tsg dislodges latent
BMPs bound to chordin BMP-binding fragments generated by Xolloid
cleavage, providing a permissive signal that allows high BMP signaling
in the embryo. Drosophila Tsg also binds BMPs and is expressed dorsally,
supporting the proposal that the dorsal-ventral axis was inverted in the
course of animal evolution.

Scott et al. (2001) showed that Tsg is coexpressed with chordin and
various BMPs in vertebrate development. In Xenopus, maternal Tsg RNA was
detected in eggs by RT-PCR, while whole-mount in situ hybridization
showed uniform Tsg expression across the entire animal hemisphere and
marginal zone of the early gastrula. In mouse, Tsg is widely expressed
throughout the 7.5-days-postcoitus gastrula and in extraembryonic
tissues. Chordin, Tsg, and BMP2 (112261), -4, and -7 (112267) are highly
expressed in the digital rays of 15.5- and 17.5-days-postcoitus embryo
hindlimbs. Strong chordin expression in the interzone of the joint
cavity is juxtaposed with strong Tsg expression at the joint articular
surfaces and the interzone. Thus, Tsg is properly situated for potential
interactions with chordin and BMPs during various stages of vertebrate
embryogenesis. Scott et al. (2001) demonstrated that Tsg binds both the
vertebrate Decapentaplegic ortholog BMP4 and chordin and that these
interactions have multiple effects. Tsg increases chordin's binding of
BMP4, potentiates chordin's ability to induce secondary axes in Xenopus
embryos, and enhances chordin cleavage by vertebrate tolloid-related
proteases at a site poorly used in Tsg's absence. The presence of Tsg
enhances the secondary axis-inducing activity of 2 products of chordin
cleavage. Scott et al. (2001) concluded that Tsg acts as a cofactor in
chordin's antagonism of BMP signaling.

Ross et al. (2001) showed that Tsg enhances the antagonistic activity of
chordin. In zebrafish, blocking of Tsg function with morpholino
oligonucleotides causes ventralization similar to that produced by
chordin mutants. Coinjection of subinhibitory levels of morpholines
directed against both Tsg and chordin synergistically enhanced the
penetrance of the ventralized phenotype. Ross et al. (2001) showed that
Tsgs from different species are functionally equivalent, and concluded
that Tsg is a conserved protein that functions with chordin to
antagonize BMP signaling. Ross et al. (2001) concluded that Tsg has 3
molecular functions. First, it can synergistically inhibit Dpp/BMP
action in both Drosophila and vertebrates by forming a tripartite
complex between itself, chordin, and a BMP ligand. Second, Tsg seems to
enhance the Tld/BMP1 (112264)-mediated cleavage rate of chordin and may
change the preference of site utilization. Third, Tsg can promote the
dissociation of chordin cysteine-rich-containing fragments from the
ligand.

Chang et al. (2001) demonstrated that Tsg can block BMP function in
Xenopus embryonic explants and inhibits several ventral markers in
whole-frog embryos. Tsg binds directly to BMPs and forms a ternary
complex with chordin and BMPs. Coexpression of Tsg with chordin leads to
a more efficient inhibition of the BMP activity in ectodermal explants.

MAPPING

By analysis of a radiation hybrid panel, Scott et al. (2001) mapped the
human TSG gene to chromosome 18p11. Backcross analysis demonstrated that
the mouse Tsg gene maps to the syntenic distal portion of chromosome 17.
Ross et al. (2001) mapped the human TSG gene to 18p11.3-p11.2 by
radiation hybrid analysis.

610512	TITLE *610512 SEC23, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF, B; SEC23B
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SEC23B is an essential component of coat protein complex II
(COPII)-coated vesicles that transport secretory proteins from the
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi complex. (Schwarz et al., 2009).

CLONING

By PCR of human B-cell and HepG2-cell cDNA libraries using primers based
on mouse Sec23, followed by screening a B-lymphocyte cDNA library,
Paccaud et al. (1996) cloned SEC23B. The deduced 767-amino acid protein
shares 47.6% identity with yeast Sec23 and 84.3% identity with human
SEC23A (610511). RNase protection assays detected variable levels of
SEC23B in all human tissues and cell lines examined. Schwarz et al.
(2009) stated that the SEC23B gene contains an N-terminal zinc finger,
Sec23/Sec24 trunk region, a beta sandwich, helical domain, and
C-terminal gelsolin-like region.

GENE FUNCTION

Paccaud et al. (1996) found that, unlike human SEC23A, human SEC23B
could not complement the growth defect in Sec23-null yeast.

Schwarz et al. (2009) demonstrated that SEC23B RNA expression was
increased relative to SEC23A expression during in vitro erythroid
differentiation of CD34+ blood cells in response to erythropoietin at
days 7 to 14. In seeded stable CD34+ cells, the relative expression
levels were equal. Silencing of SEC23B with shRNA resulted in an
increase in binucleated erythrocytes with twice the amount of DNA,
suggesting a defect in cytokinesis. The findings suggested that the cell
cycle of erythroid cells and their cytokinesis depend on a sufficient
level of SEC23B. Schwarz et al. (2009) hypothesized that a reduction in
SEC23B in erythroblasts may be cell-specific and not sufficiently
compensated for by SEC23A expression in these cells.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the SEC23B
gene to chromosome 20 (TMAP SHGC-31801).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected individuals from 23 families with congenital
dyserythropoietic anemia type II (CDAN2; 224100), Schwarz et al. (2009)
identified 18 different mutations and 1 deletion in the SEC23B gene
(see, e.g., 610512.0001-612512.0005). All mutations were in the
homozygous or compound heterozygous state, consistent with autosomal
recessive inheritance.

Bianchi et al. (2009) identified 12 different mutations in the SEC23B
gene (see, e.g. R217X; 612512.0006) in 13 patients from 10 unrelated
families with CDAN2. The most common mutations were E109K (612512.0001)
and R14W (612512.0002). Most of the patients were Italian.

ANIMAL MODEL

Schwarz et al. (2009) found that knockdown of the Sec23b gene in
zebrafish embryos led to a pronounced reduction of the lower jaw on day
3 post fertilization. Erythrocytes derived from the Sec23b-silenced
zebrafish showed an increase in immature, binucleated erythrocytes
compared to wildtype. However, the complete human phenotype was not
replicated, probably due to early lethality in the zebrafish. There was
no evidence of N-linked hypoglycosylation or duplication of rough
endoplasmic reticulum.

SEC23B, GLU109LYS

In affected members of 7 unrelated families with congenital
dyserythropoietic anemia type II (CDAN2; 224100), Schwarz et al. (2009)
identified a homozygous 325G-A transition in exon 4 of the SEC23B gene,
resulting in a glu109-to-lys (E109K) substitution in the N-terminal zinc
finger domain. Two additional probands were compound heterozygous for
E109K and another pathogenic mutation. The mutation was not identified
in 237 healthy individuals. Haplotype analysis did not identify a
founder effect. In vitro functional expression studies showed that the
E109K protein was unstable, with less than 5% of protein detectable
compared to wildtype SEC23B.

Bianchi et al. (2009) identified a homozygous E109K mutation in 3
members of an Italian family with CDAN2 and in another unrelated Italian
patient with the disorder.

In affected members of 10 unrelated families with congenital
dyserythropoietic anemia type II (CDAN2; 224100), Schwarz et al. (2009)
identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the SEC23B gene.
All families had a heterozygous 40C-T transition in exon 2, resulting in
an arg14-to-trp (R14W) substitution at the interface of the zinc finger
domain and SEC23B core fold. In vitro functional expression studies
showed that the R14W protein was unstable, with less than 5% of protein
detectable compared to wildtype SEC23B. Mutations found in compound
heterozygosity with R14W included a 1588C-T transition in exon 14,
resulting in an arg530-to-trp (R530W; 610512.0003) substitution; a
790C-T transition in exon 7, resulting in an arg264-to-ter (R264X;
610512.0004) substitution; and a 970C-T transition in exon 8, resulting
in an arg324-to-ter (R324X; 610512.0005) substitution.

Bianchi et al. (2009) identified the R14W mutation in compound
heterozygosity with another pathogenic SEC23B mutation (see, e.g.,
R217X; 610512.0006) in 6 patients from 5 unrelated families with CDAN2.
All of the patients were Italian, except for 1 who was Rumanian.

603819	TITLE *603819 STEROID RECEPTOR RNA ACTIVATOR 1; SRA1
;;SRA
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screening system, Lanz et al. (1999) isolated a
transcriptional coactivator of steroid nuclear receptors, termed steroid
receptor RNA activator (SRA). Northern blot analysis revealed that the
SRA gene was expressed in all human tissues tested as major transcripts
of approximately 0.7 to 0.85 kb and minor transcripts of approximately
1.3 to 1.5 kb; SRA was expressed at high levels in liver and skeletal
muscle and at a low level in brain.

GENE FUNCTION

Lanz et al. (1999) found that SRA was selective for steroid hormone
receptors and mediated transactivation via their N-terminal activation
function. The authors provided functional and mechanistic evidence that
SRA acts as an RNA transcript; transfected SRA, unlike other steroid
receptor coregulators, functioned in the presence of cycloheximide, and
SRA mutants containing multiple translational stop signals retained
their ability to activate steroid receptor-dependent gene expression.
Biochemical fractionation showed that SRA exists in distinct
ribonucleoprotein complexes, one of which contains steroid receptor
coactivator-1 (602691). Lanz et al. (1999) suggested that SRA may act to
confer functional specificity upon multiprotein complexes recruited by
liganded receptors during transcriptional activation.

By immunoprecipitation analysis, Caretti et al. (2006) found that p68
(DDX5; 180630), p72 (DDX17; 608469), and the noncoding RNA SRA
associated with MYOD (MYOD1; 159970) in MYOD-transfected HeLa cells. In
vitro and in vivo experiments identified p68, p72, and SRA as
coactivators of MYOD, and their knockdown in C2C12 mouse myoblast cells
prevented proper muscle gene expression and cell differentiation.

MAPPING

By sequence comparisons, Lanz et al. (1999) identified partial SRA
sequences isolated as HepG2 3-prime untranslated region (GenBank GENBANK
D16861), EST clones, and chromosome 5 BAC clone 319C17 (GenBank GENBANK
AC005214), providing a preliminary mapping of the SRA gene to chromosome
5.

164795	TITLE *164795 ONCOMODULIN; OCM
DESCRIPTION Oncomodulin and parvalbumin (168890) are structurally closely related,
high-affinity calcium ion-binding proteins. Both belong to the
superfamily of calmodulin proteins, also termed EF-hand proteins.
Intron/exon organizations of the parvalbumin and oncomodulin genes are
identical and the coding sequences are moderately similar, suggesting a
common ancestor. Oncomodulin is a an oncodevelopmental protein found in
early embryonic cells, in the placenta, and in tumors; parvalbumin is
synthesized at highest levels in muscle fibers of the IIB type and in
most GABAergic cells of the brain. By Southern blot analysis of genomic
DNA from 25 human-hamster somatic cell hybrids, Ritzler et al. (1992)
showed that the human gene for oncomodulin is located on chromosome 7.
Analysis of human-mouse hybrids retaining portions of human chromosome 7
allowed specific assignment of the gene locus to 7p13-p11.

Staubli et al. (1995) used interspecific backcross analysis and
fluorescence in situ hybridization to map the oncomodulin gene to mouse
chromosome 5.

607418	TITLE *607418 GRIP AND COILED-COIL DOMAINS-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1; GCC1
;;GOLGI COILED-COIL PROTEIN 1;;
GCC PROTEIN, 88-KD; GCC88
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Kjer-Nielsen et al. (1999) identified GCC1 in a database search for
sequences related to the C-terminal domain of the p230 trans-Golgi
network protein (GOLGA4; 602509). The deduced 633-amino acid GCC1
protein contains the 42-amino acid minimum Golgi-targeting sequence at
its C terminus, including 2 conserved aromatic residues that
Kjer-Nielsen et al. (1999) demonstrated are required for Golgi
localization. GCC1 lacks a putative transmembrane domain, consistent
with it being a peripheral membrane protein.

By searching for genes encoding proteins containing GRIP domains,
followed by RT-PCR and 5-prime RACE of HeLa cell RNA, Luke et al. (2003)
cloned GCC1 and GCC2 (612704), which they called GCC88 and GCC185,
respectively. Both proteins contain a coiled-coil region and a
C-terminal GRIP domain of about 50 amino acids. The deduced 775-amino
acid GCC88 protein has a calculated molecular mass of 88 kD. Both
endogenous and fluorescence-tagged GCC88 and GCC185 localized to the
trans-Golgi network, and this localization required a functional GRIP
domain. Brefeldin A treatment indicated that both GCC88 and GCC185 are
peripheral membrane Golgi proteins. Western blot analysis of HeLa cell
extracts detected endogenous GCC88 at an apparent molecular mass of 105
kD.

GENE FUNCTION

Luke et al. (2003) found that overexpression of full-length GCC88 in
transfected COS cells led to the formation of large, electron-dense,
cauliflower-like structures that extended from the trans-Golgi.
Formation of these abnormal structures required the N-terminal domain of
GCC88. By following transport of Tgn38 (603062) between the trans-Golgi
and plasma membrane in normal rat kidney cells, Luke et al. (2003)
showed that the GCC88-containing structures mediated movement of
membrane cargo molecules.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the GCC1
gene to chromosome 7 (TMAP stSG1940).

;;HNRPA2B1
HETEROGENEOUS NUCLEAR RIBONUCLEOPROTEIN A2, INCLUDED; HNRPA2, INCLUDED;;
HETEROGENEOUS NUCLEAR RIBONUCLEOPROTEIN B1, INCLUDED; HNRPB1, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The HNRNPA2B1 gene encodes 2 major proteins, HNRNPA2 and HNRNPB1,
through alternative splicing. HNRNPA/B proteins, such as HNRNPA2 and
HNRNPB1, are involved in packaging nascent mRNA, in alternative
splicing, and in cytoplasmic RNA trafficking, translation, and
stabilization. HNRNPA2 and HNRNPB1 also appear to function in telomere
maintenance, cell proliferation and differentiation, and glucose
transport (Moran-Jones et al., 2005; Iwanaga et al., 2005).

CLONING

By immunoscreening a HeLa cell cDNA expression library using mouse
anti-A2 and anti-B1 antibodies, followed by screening a human
osteosarcoma cDNA library, Burd et al. (1989) obtained full-length A2
and B1 clones. The B1 cDNA has a 36-nucleotide insertion near its
5-prime end relative to A2, but they are otherwise identical. The
deduced A2 protein contains 341 amino acids, and the deduced B1 protein
contains an in-frame 12-amino acid insert after glu2 compared with A2.
Both proteins contain 2 consensus-type RNA-binding domains, followed by
an extended C-terminal glycine-rich region. The insert in B1 introduces
a putative nuclear localization signal. In vitro translation produced A2
and B1 proteins that comigrated with purified endogenous HeLa cell A2
and B1 at apparent molecular masses of 36 and 38 kD, respectively.

Biamonti et al. (1994) and Kozu et al. (1995) independently cloned
HNRNPA2B1. Biamonti et al. (1994) determined that the 36-nucleotide
insertion in the B1 transcript arises from inclusion of exon 2. Using
Northern blot and RT-PCR analyses, Kozu et al. (1995) detected a 1.8-kb
transcript representing total A2/B1 mRNA in all 3 human cell lines
examined. The levels of B1 expression were about 2 to 5% of total A2/B1
levels in these cell lines. RT-PCR of mouse tissues suggested ubiquitous
expression of both A2 and B1 transcripts.

GENE FUNCTION

Translational repression of glucose transporter-1 (GLUT1, or SLC2A1;
138140) in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM; 137800) is mediated by a
specific RNA-binding protein that interacts with an AU-rich response
element in the 3-prime UTR of the GLUT1 transcript. Hamilton et al.
(1999) showed that HNRNPA2 and HNRNPL (603083) bound the 3-prime UTR of
GLUT1 mRNA. Induction of brain ischemia in rats or hypoglycemic stress
in 293 cells increased GLUT1 expression via mRNA stability. Polysomes
isolated from ischemic rat brains or hypoglycemic 293 cells showed loss
of HNRNPA2 and HNRNPL, suggesting that reduced levels of these
RNA-binding proteins results in GLUT1 mRNA stability.
Immunoprecipitation of polysomes from activated human T lymphocytes
suggested that HNRNPA2 and HNRNPL form a complex in vivo.

Using pull-down assays and EMSA, Moran-Jones et al. (2005) identified
Hnrnpa2 and Hnrnpa3 (605372) as the predominant single-stranded telomere
repeat-binding proteins in rat brain. Using rat and human constructs,
they identified 2 oligonucleotide-binding sites in HNRNPA2. One site
bound single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) with little or no nucleotide sequence
preference, whereas the second site bound specific RNA and DNA
sequences. The latter site bound single-stranded TTAGGG telomere repeats
and a cytoplasmic RNA-trafficking element (A2RE11). Mutation analysis
indicated that the tandem RRM domains also bound the telomerase RNA
(TERC; 602322), but the individual RRM domains did not. Full-length
HNRNPA2, but not HNRNPA2 truncation mutants, protected telomeric DNA
from DNase, suggesting that the glycine-rich domain as well as the RRM
domains are required for telomere protection. Moran-Jones et al. (2005)
proposed that HNRNPA2 can potentially bind telomeric DNA repeats and the
RNA component of telomerase simultaneously, or that it may bind ssDNA in
both sites and act as an intramolecular or intermolecular crosslink.

DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNAPK; see 600899) is a multisubunit
kinase involved in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks through
nonhomologous end-joining. Iwanaga et al. (2005) found that HNRNPB1
interacted directly with the DNAPK subunit Ku70 (XRCC6; 152690) and
inhibited DNAPK activity in a dose-dependent manner in vitro. Knockdown
of HNRNPA2B1 in irradiated normal human bronchial epithelial cells
reduced HNRNPB1 levels and enhanced recovery of DNA strand breaks
compared with controls.

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis of a human brain cDNA library, Kosturko et
al. (2006) found that mouse Hnrnpa2 interacted with human HNRNPE1
(PCBP1; 601209). They confirmed the interaction with in vivo and in
vitro protein interaction assays. Hnrnpe1 colocalized with Hnrnpa2 and
A2RE mRNA in granules in dendrites of rat oligodendrocytes.
Overexpression of HNRNPE1 or microinjection of exogenous HNRNPE1 in rat
neural cells inhibited translation of A2RE mRNA, but not translation of
mutated A2RE mRNA. Excess HNRNPE1 added to an in vitro translation
system reduced translation efficiency of A2RE mRNA in an
Hnrnpa2-dependent manner. Kosturko et al. (2006) hypothesized that
binding of HNRNPE1 to HNRNPA2 inhibits A2RE mRNA translation during
granule transport.

A transgenic fly model of fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome
(FXTAS; 300623) in which the 5-prime UTR of human FMR1 (309550)
containing 90 CGG repeats is expressed specifically in the eye results
in disorganized ommatidia, depigmentation, and progressive loss of
photoreceptor neurons. Sofola et al. (2007) found that overexpression of
human CUGBP1 (601074) suppressed the neurodegenerative eye phenotype in
transgenic flies. CUGBP1 did not interact directly with the CGG repeats,
but did so via HNRNPA2B1. Expression of the A2 isoform of human
HNRNPA2B1, or the Drosophila orthologs, also suppressed the eye
phenotype of FXTAS flies. Mouse Hnrnpa2b1 interacted directly with CGG
repeat RNA (rCGG) in mouse cerebellar lysates, and increased repeat
length increased the binding affinity. The interaction was most evident
in cytoplasmic cerebellar lysates. Nuclear Hnrnpa2b1 showed little or no
interaction with rCGG repeats, suggesting that protein modification, in
either the nuclear or cytoplasmic compartment, affects the interaction.

David et al. (2010) showed that 3 hnRNP proteins, polypyrimidine
tract-binding protein (PTB, also known as hnRNPI; 600693), hnRNPA1
(164017), and hnRNPA2, bind repressively to sequences flanking exon 9 of
the PKM2 gene (179050), resulting in exon 10 inclusion and expression of
the PKM2 (embryonic) isoform. David et al. (2010) also demonstrated that
the oncogenic transcription factor c-MYC (190080) upregulates
transcription of PTB, hnRNPA1, and hnRNPA2, ensuring a high PKM2/PKM1
ratio. Establishing a relevance to cancer, David et al. (2010) showed
that human gliomas (137800) overexpress c-Myc, PTB, hnRNPA1, and hnRNPA2
in a manner that correlates with PKM2 expression. David et al. (2010)
concluded that their results defined a pathway that regulates an
alternative splicing event required for tumor cell proliferation.

Kim et al. (2013) reported that HNRNPA2B1 has a C-terminal glycine-rich
domain that is essential for activity and mediates interaction with
TDP43 (605078). This low-complexity domain is predicted to be
intrinsically unfolded and has an amino acid composition similar to that
of yeast prion domains. Approximately 250 human proteins, including
several RNA-binding proteins associated with neurodegenerative disease,
harbor a similar distinctive prion-like domain (PrLD) enriched in
uncharged polar amino acids and glycine. PrLDs in RNA-binding proteins
are essential for the assembly of ribonucleoprotein granules. Kim et al.
(2013) showed that HNRNPA2, the most abundant form of HNRNPA2B1, has an
intrinsic tendency to assemble into self-seeding fibrils.

GENE STRUCTURE

Biamonti et al. (1994) determined that the HNRNPA2B1 gene contains 12
exons, including an alternatively spliced 36-nucleotide mini-exon
specific for the B1 protein. The intron/exon organization of HNRNPA2B1
is identical to that of the HNRNPA1 gene over its entire length,
indicating a common origin by gene duplication.

Kozu et al. (1995) determined that the HNRNPA2B1 gene spans over 9 kb.
The 5-prime region is GC rich and contains several binding sites for
ubiquitous transcription factors, including 7 H4TF1 elements and 2 CCAAT
boxes, but no TATA sequence. The 3-prime region contains a
pyrimidine-rich RNA degradation motif prior to the polyadenylation
signal. Intron 8 contains an Alu repeat that is not found in the HNRNPA1
gene.

MAPPING

Biamonti et al. (1994) mapped the HNRNPA2B1 gene to chromosome 7p15 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a family with dominantly inherited degeneration of muscle, bone,
brain, and motor neurons (IBMPFD2; 615422), Kim et al. (2013) identified
a missense mutation in the HNRNPA2B1 gene that altered a conserved
aspartic acid at position 290 of the short (A2) isoform and 302 of the
long (B1) isoform (600124.0001). Kim et al. (2013) showed that the
intrinsic tendency of HNRNPA2, the most abundant form of HNRNPA2B1, and
HNRNPA1 (164017) to assemble into self-seeding fibrils is exacerbated by
disease mutations. The pathogenic mutations strengthen a 'steric zipper'
motif in the prion-like domain (PrLD) that accelerates the formation of
self-seeding fibrils that cross-seed polymerization of wildtype HNRNP.
Notably, disease mutations promoted excess incorporation of HNRNPA2 and
HNRNPA1 into stress granules and drove the formation of cytoplasmic
inclusions in animal models that recapitulated the human pathology. Kim
et al. (2013) concluded that dysregulated polymerization caused by a
potent mutant steric zipper motif in a PrLD can initiate degenerative
disease.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
INCLUSION BODY MYOPATHY WITH EARLY-ONSET PAGET DISEASE AND FRONTOTEMPORAL
DEMENTIA 2 (1 family)
HNRNPA2B1, ASP290VAL

In affected members of a family segregating autosomal dominant inclusion
body myopathy with Paget disease of the bone and frontotemporal dementia
(IBMPFD2; 615422), Kim et al. (2013) identified an 869A-T transversion
in the A2 isoform of the HNRNPA2B1 gene (905A-T in the B1 isoform)
resulting in an aspartic acid-to-valine substitution at codon 290
(D290V; ASP302VAL, D302V in the B1 isoform). This was the family
originally reported by Waggoner et al. (2002). The aspartic acid at this
position is evolutionarily conserved to Drosophila, and is centered in a
motif, the prion-like domain (PrLD), that is conserved in multiple human
paralogs of the HNRNP A/B family. The mutation segregated with the
disease in the family and was not identified in the NHLBI Exome
Sequencing Project. In another family with a similar phenotype, Kim et
al. (2013) detected an aspartic acid-to-valine substitution at the
analogous residue of HNRNPA1 (164017.0001).

605525	TITLE *605525 CHROMATIN LICENSING AND DNA REPLICATION FACTOR 1; CDT1
;;DOUBLE PARKED, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF; DUP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Whittaker et al. (2000) identified a Drosophila gene, which they called
'double parked,' or Dup, that is essential for DNA replication and
belongs to a family of replication proteins conserved from S. pombe to
humans. Strong mutations in Dup were found to cause embryonic lethality,
preceded by a failure to undergo S phase during the postblastoderm
divisions. The authors showed that Dup is also required for DNA
replication in the adult ovary, establishing that it is needed for DNA
replication at multiple stages of development.

GENE FUNCTION

Geminin (602842) is a protein that inhibits DNA replication by
preventing the loading of the minichromosome maintenance (MCM) complex
on chromatin. Wohlschlegel et al. (2000) raised antibodies to
bacterially expressed His6-geminin and identified DUP, which they called
CDT1, as its target. They found that the human DUP cDNA reported by
Whittaker et al. (2000) had a frameshift error that resulted in the
deletion of amino acids 1 to 145. Wohlschlegel et al. (2000) determined
that human CDT1 is a 65-kD protein that contains 546 amino acids and
coimmunoprecipitates with geminin. Inhibition of DNA replication by
geminin in cell-free cDNA replication extracts could be reversed by the
addition of excess CDT1. In the normal cell cycle, CDT1 is present only
in G1 and S phases, whereas geminin is present in S and G2 phases.
Wohlschlegel et al. (2000) concluded that their results suggest that
geminin inhibits inappropriate origin firing by targeting CDT1.

Zhong et al. (2003) showed that the CUL4 ubiquitin ligase (see 603137)
temporally restricts DNA replication licensing in Caenorhabditis
elegans. Inactivation of CUL4 causes massive DNA rereplication,
producing cells with up to 100C DNA content. The C. elegans ortholog of
the replication-licensing factor Cdt1 is required for DNA replication.
C. elegans CDT1 is present in G1-phase nuclei but disappears as cells
enter S phase. In cells lacking CUL4, CDT1 levels failed to decrease
during S phase and instead remained constant in the rereplicating cells.
Removal of 1 genomic copy of CDT1 suppressed the CUL4 rereplication
phenotype. Zhong et al. (2003) proposed that CUL4 prevents aberrant
reinitiation of DNA replication, at least in part, by facilitating the
degradation of CDT1.

Initiation of DNA replication requires the assembly of a prereplication
complex (pre-RC) in late mitosis and G1, with sequential loading of the
origin recognition complex (see ORC1; 601902), CDC6 (602627), CDT1, and
the MCM2-7 complex (see MCM2; 116945) onto replication origins. Upon
initiation of DNA replication, the pre-RC is disassembled, and CDT1 and
CDC6 are released from the origins to prevent rereplication. Using human
cell lines, Shen et al. (2012) showed that ORCA (LRWD1; 615617) was
required for pre-RC assembly and replication initiation. Knockdown of
ORCA via small interfering RNA reduced association of ORC and MCM2-7
with chromatin and caused failure of cell cycle progression through S
phase. ORCA associated dynamically with different pre-RC components
during the cell cycle: it associated with ORC and CDT1 at G1, with
ORC(2-5) and geminin in S phase, and with ORC(2-5), phosphorylated CDT1,
and phosphorylated geminin during mitosis. ORCA interacted directly with
ORC2 (601182), CDT1, and geminin, and ORC2 was required for ORCA
stability. Overexpression of geminin reduced the affinity of CDT1 for
ORCA, and loss of association between ORCA and CDT1 appeared to be a key
step in disassembling the pre-RC at the end of G1 phase.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Lee et al. (2004) described the crystal structure of the mouse geminin
(602842)-Cdt1 complex using a truncated geminin involving residues
79-157 and a truncated Cdt1 including residues 172-368. The N-terminal
region of a coiled-coil dimer of truncated geminin interacted with both
N-terminal and C-terminal parts of truncated Cdt1. The primary interface
relied on the steric complementarity between the truncated geminin dimer
and hydrophobic face of the 2 short N-terminal helices of truncated Cdt1
and, in particular, pro181, ala182, tyr183, phe186, and leu189. Lee et
al. (2004) concluded that the crystal structure, in conjunction with
their biochemical data, indicated that the N-terminal region of
truncated geminin might be required to anchor truncated Cdt1, and the
C-terminal region of truncated geminin prevents access of the MCM
complex to truncated Cdt1 through steric hindrance.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 7 patients from 5 families with the Meier-Gorlin syndrome-4 form of
microcephalic primordial dwarfism (MGORS4; 613804), Bicknell et al.
(2011) identified compound heterozygosity for missense, nonsense, and
splice site mutations in the CDT1 gene (see, e.g.,
605525.0001-605525.0004).

In a 15-year-old girl with Meier-Gorlin syndrome who was negative for
mutation in the ORC4 gene, Guernsey et al. (2011) sequenced candidate
genes encoding ORC complex or pathway-associated proteins and identified
homozygosity for a missense mutation in the CDT1 gene (605525.0005).

In 4 patients from 2 families with Meier-Gorlin syndrome-4 (613804),
including 3 sibs who were previously reported by Feingold (2002),
Bicknell et al. (2011) identified compound heterozygosity for a 1385G-A
transition in exon 9 of the CDT1 gene, resulting in an arg462-to-gln
(R462Q) substitution at a conserved residue in the C-terminal winged
helix domain, and a 1560C-A transversion in exon 10, resulting in a
tyr520-to-ter (Y520X; 605525.0002) substitution, predicted to cause
premature termination of the protein. The unaffected parents from both
families were each heterozygous for 1 of the mutations, respectively. In
a proband from another family with Meier-Gorlin syndrome, Bicknell et
al. (2011) identified compound heterozygosity for R462Q and a splice
site mutation in the CDT1 gene (605525.0003). None of the mutations was
found in 380 control chromosomes.

transversion (351G-C) in intron 2 of the CDT1 gene and the R462Q
missense mutation (605525.0001).

In an unrelated 7-year-old girl with Meier-Gorlin syndrome, Bicknell et
al. (2011) identified compound heterozygosity for the 351G-C splice site
mutation and a 196G-A transition in exon 1 of the CDT1 gene, resulting
in an ala66-to-thr (A66T) substitution (605525.0004). Neither mutation

for a glu468-to-lys (E468K) substitution at a conserved residue in the
C-terminal region of the CDT1 protein, which is believed to interact
with the minichromosome maintenance complex during origin recognition.

mutation, which was not found in controls, including some of Acadian
ethnicity.

;;KALLIKREIN 7;;
PROTEASE, SERINE, 6; PRSS6;;
STRATUM CORNEUM CHYMOTRYPTIC ENZYME; SCCE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

KLK7 belongs to the kallikrein subfamily of serine proteases, which are
involved in a variety of enzymatic processes (Gan et al., 2000).

CLONING

The stratum corneum is the outermost layer of the epidermis, i.e., the
stratified squamous epithelium lining the body surface. The cells of the
stratum corneum, the corneocytes, represent the end stage of the
epidermal differentiation process. Corneocytes are highly resistant
anucleated cells mainly consisting of keratin filaments surrounded by a
crosslinked protein envelope. The mechanical resistance of the stratum
corneum is dependent on the cohesion between individual corneocytes,
which is mediated to a major extent by modified desmosomes. Since a
fraction of epidermal cells continuously leaves the proliferating basal
layer and goes through differentiation, there is a continuous de novo
production of corneocytes. This is balanced to give a constant and
well-regulated stratum corneum thickness by cell shedding at the skin
surface in a process called desquamation. Desquamation means elimination
of stratum corneum cell cohesion in superficial cell layers. It has been
established that proteolysis of intercellular cohesive structures is of
major importance in the series of events preceding desquamation. Stratum
corneum chymotryptic enzyme (SCCE), or kallikrein-7 (KLK7), is a serine
proteinase with an inhibitor profile, pH dependence, and tissue
localization compatible with a role in desquamation. Egelrud (1993)
purified SCCE from human plantar corneocytes. SDS-PAGE indicated that
the purified preparation contained 1 major component with an apparent
molecular mass of 25 kD and 1 minor component with a slightly higher
apparent molecular mass. Both of these components were associated with
chymotrypsin-like activity, although SCCE differed significantly from
bovine chymotrypsin, human cathepsin G (116830), and human mast cell
chymases (see 118938) in its relative activity toward various substrates
and in its inhibitor profile. Hansson et al. (1994) sequenced the
N-terminal region of the native SCCE enzyme. By screening a human
keratinocyte cDNA library with a degenerate oligonucleotide based on the
amino acid sequence of SCCE, they isolated 2 forms of SCCE cDNA that
differed only in the 3-prime untranslated region. The predicted
253-amino acid protein consists of a 22-amino acid signal peptide and a
7-amino acid propeptide followed by the active enzyme. SCCE contains the
conserved active site regions of serine proteinases and a potential
N-glycosylation site. The amino acid sequence homology between SCCE and
human chymotrypsin, cathepsin G, and mast cell chymase, all of which
have chymotryptic activity, did not exceed 40%. Hansson et al. (1994)
demonstrated that SCCE is heterogenously glycosylated. Northern blot
analysis detected 1.2- and 2.0-kb SCCE transcripts in human skin.
Abundant SCCE mRNA expression was restricted to skin, with very low
levels of expression found in brain and kidney. Immunohistochemical
analyses had shown that the SCCE protein is present in high suprabasal
keratinocytes in the epidermis and in the keratinizing inner root sheet
of the hair follicle (Sondell et al., 1994). In the human oral cavity,
only suprabasal keratinocytes at sites where a stratum corneum is formed
contained SCCE.

Yousef et al. (2000) noted the presence of 12 cysteine residues in KLK7,
10 of which are conserved in all serine proteases, and 2 of which are
also found in other KLK proteins. RT-PCR analysis revealed expression
primarily in brain, mammary gland, cerebellum, spinal cord, kidney, and
skin, with lower levels or none detected in other tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

Yousef et al. (2000) observed the upregulation of KLK7 expression in a
breast cancer cell in response to estrogens and glucocorticoids.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Yousef et al. (2000) determined that the
KLK7 gene contains 6 exons, 5 of which are coding. The gene spans 6 kb.

MAPPING

By computational analysis, Yousef et al. (2000) mapped the KLK7 gene to
chromosome 19q13.3-q13.4 between KLK6 (602652) and KLK8 (605644).

607264	TITLE *607264 EPSIN 3; EPN3
DESCRIPTION For background information on epsins, see EPN1 (607262).

CLONING

By differential display RT-PCR, Spradling et al. (2001) identified EPN3
as an mRNA induced in keratinocytes activated by plating onto fibrillar
type I collagen (see 120150). They cloned the full-length cDNA from a
cDNA library prepared from freshly isolated and collagen-activated
keratinocytes. The deduced 632-amino acid protein has a calculated
molecular mass of 68 kD. EPN3 has the same tripartite domain structure
as EPN1 and EPN2 (607263), including an epsin N-terminal homology (ENTH)
domain, multiple DPW sequences and a clathrin (see 118960)-binding motif
in its central region, and a C-terminal consensus sequence of 3 NPF
repeats that bind EPS15 (600051). The ENTH domain of EPN3 shares 80% and
82% sequence identity with those of EPN1 and EPN2, respectively, and the
3 NPF repeats are 100% conserved in these 3 proteins. EPN3 has a distal
low-affinity clathrin-binding sequence in addition to the high-affinity
site. Northern blot analysis detected a 3.9-kb EPN3 transcript only in
collagen-activated keratinocytes. EPN3 was absent from freshly isolated
intact skin and was not expressed in most adult and fetal tissues
examined. Expression was detected in stomach only after extended
exposure. Western blot analysis indicated an apparent molecular mass of
68 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

Spradling et al. (2001) observed that EPN3 mRNA was induced 20-fold in
collagen-activated keratinocytes compared with cells freshly isolated
from unwounded skin. The mRNA level peaked 20 hours after contact with
the collagen matrix and was again undetectable at 72 hours. Northern
blot analysis indicated that EPN3 mRNA was reduced by 85% in human
keratinocytes cultured on gelatin, indicating that the native
triple-helical structure of collagen was required to induce expression.
Immunolocalization of EPN3 showed prominent cytoplasmic staining that
concentrated in the perinuclear region. A subpopulation of EPN3
colocalized to clathrin-coated structures predominantly located at the
cell periphery. EPN3 was absent from a pool of clathrin located near the
nucleus. Treatment of keratinocytes with leptomycin B resulted in
nuclear accumulation of EPN3, suggesting that EPN3 shuttles to the
nucleus. Immunolocalization of EPN3 within cultured punch biopsies
indicated that EPN3 localized to basal keratinocytes within the
migrating epithelial tongue at the cell-extracellular matrix (ECM)
interface. RT-PCR detected EPN3 expression in chronic cutaneous wound,
basal cell carcinoma, and ulcerative colitis (see 266600), all wounds or
pathologies that undergo altered cell-ECM interactions.

GENE STRUCTURE

Spradling et al. (2001) determined that the EPN3 gene contains 9 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Spradling et al. (2001) mapped the EPN3
gene to chromosome 17.

;;FORMIN, INVERTED, 2;;
CHROMOSOME 14 OPEN READING FRAME 173; C14ORF173
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Actin filaments grow only when actin monomers have access to the
fast-growing barbed end of the filament. The geometry of the filament
network depends on the actions of the ARP2/3 complex (604221) and
members of the formin family, such as INF2. The ARP2/3 complex binds to
the sides of preexisting filaments and nucleates filaments whose barbed
ends are quickly blocked by capping proteins, producing brush-like
structures, such as those found at the leading edges of crawling cells.
In contrast, formins bind to the barbed ends of growing filaments and
protect them from capping, creating long filaments that can be
cross-linked into bundles, such as those found in actin cables of yeast.
Interaction of formins with actin barbed ends occurs through the formin
homology-2 (FH2) domain. FH2 domains accelerate filament nucleation,
move with the barbed end as the filament grows, and block capping of the
barbed end by proteins such as gelsolin (GSN; 137350). The FH1 domain of
formins binds to profilin (see 176610) and accelerates elongation from
the FH2-bound barbed ends (Bindschadler and McGrath, 2004; Chhabra and
Higgs, 2006).

CLONING

By searching databases for FH2 domain sequences, Higgs and Peterson
(2005) identified mouse and human INF2, a member of the inverted formin
group. Inverted formins have an N-terminal FH2 domain rather than the
C-terminal FH2 domain found in all other formins.

By database analysis and RT-PCR, Chhabra and Higgs (2006) cloned
full-length mouse Inf2. The deduced 1,274-amino acid protein has an
N-terminal diaphanous inhibitory domain (DID), followed by an FH1
domain, an FH2 domain, and a C-terminal diaphanous autoregulatory domain
(DAD)/ WASP (300392) homology-2 (WH2) domain. Thus, Inf2 is not an
inverted formin, but is most similar to diaphanous formins (e.g.,
DIAPH1; 602121), which are regulated by autoinhibition via DID-DAD
interaction.

By immunohistochemical staining, Boyer et al. (2011) demonstrated robust
IFN2 expression in peripheral nerve Schwann cells and light staining in
some axons. INF2 was also expressed predominantly in podocytes in the
kidney, as well as in some tubules, but not in vessels. INF2 colocalized
with the myelin and lymphocyte protein (MAL; 188860) in human peripheral
nerve and mouse Schwann cells, and with MAL2 (609684) in human
podocytes. MAL was not present in glomeruli. In HeLa cells, INF2 showed
perinuclear localization.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the
C14ORF173 gene to chromosome 14 (TMAP RH102965).

GENE FUNCTION

Using fluorescence microscopy to study the effects of various constructs
containing domains of mouse Inf2 on actin elongation and nucleation,
Chhabra and Higgs (2006) showed that Inf2 interacted with actin through
a region C-terminal to the FH2 domain. This region, in combination with
the FH2 domain, accelerated both polymerization and depolymerization of
actin filaments. Depolymerization resulted from actin monomer-binding
ability of the WH2 domain and a severing activity that depended on
attachment of the FH2 domain to the C terminus. Phosphate inhibited both
depolymerization and severing, suggesting that phosphate release from
actin subunits in the filament triggers depolymerization. Mutation of
the WH2 domain abrogated depolymerization.

Korobova et al. (2013) found that actin polymerization through
endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized INF2 was required for efficient
mitochondrial fission in mammalian cells. INF2 functioned upstream of
DRP1 (603850). Actin filaments appeared to accumulate between
mitochondria and INF2-enriched ER membranes at constriction sites. Thus,
INF2-induced actin filaments may drive initial mitochondrial
constriction, which allows DRP1-driven secondary constriction. Because
INF2 mutations can lead to Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (614455),
Korobova et al. (2013) concluded that their results provided a potential
cellular mechanism for this disease state.

In 2 large families segregating autosomal dominant focal segmental
glomerulosclerosis mapping to chromosome 14q32 (FSGS5; 613237), Brown et
al. (2010) sequenced 15 candidate genes and identified heterozygous
missense mutations in the INF2 gene in both families that segregated
with disease (610982.0001 and 610982.0002, respectively). Sequencing of
the INF2 gene in 91 unrelated individuals with familial FSGS revealed 9
additional families with heterozygous mutations in the INF2 gene that
segregated with disease (see, e.g., 610982.0003-610982.0005). Brown et
al. (2010) noted that all 9 of the disease-segregating substitutions are
located at conserved residues within the DID (diaphanous-inhibitory
domain) region of INF2, with 7 residing in close proximity to each other
in exon 4 of the gene. Studies in transfected podocytes demonstrated
alterations in the subcellular localization of INF2 and the pattern of
distribution of the associated F-actin with mutant forms of INF2
compared to wildtype, as well as less prominent actin filament bundles
on electron micrographs.

- Dominant Intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease E with
Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis

In 12 (75%) of 16 index patients with dominant intermediate
Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease E (CMTDIE; 614455) with focal segmental
glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), Boyer et al. (2011) identified 9 novel
heterozygous mutations in the INF2 gene (see, e.g.,
610982.0006-610982.0011). All mutations were located in exons 2 and 3,
which encode the diaphanous inhibitory domain (DID), and most of them
were between nucleotides 300 and 500 in the second and third armadillo
repeats. These mutations were located in distinct areas from those
associated with isolated FSGS5, most of which are located downstream of
nucleotide 500 in the fourth armadillo repeat domain. The 12 index
patients with INF2 mutations reported by Boyer et al. (2011) presented
with proteinuria at a median age of 18 years (range, 10-21 years), and
11 developed end-stage renal disease at a median age of 21 years (range,
12-47 years). Renal biopsies showed FSGS. The median age at onset of
neurologic dysfunction was 13 years (range, 5-28 years), and all had
distal muscle atrophy and weakness affecting the lower limbs. Some had
upper limb involvement as well. Neurophysiologic studies and sural nerve
biopsies indicated an intermediate form of CMT. Four patients also had
mild to moderate sensorineural hearing loss. INF2 mutations were not
found in 50 patients with CMT without renal involvement. In vitro
functional expression studies by Boyer et al. (2011) showed that mutant
INF2 was abnormally dispersed throughout the cytoplasm, resulting in a
broader cytoplasmic distribution of MAL. Cells expressing mutant INF2
exhibited less cortical actin and a reduced number of long actin stress
fibers compared to wildtype, suggesting a disorganized microtubule
network. Finally, INF2 mutants showed an enhanced interaction with CDC42
(116952), an actin-regulating Rho-GTPase known to interact with the INF2
DID domain, resulting in altered intracellular localization of CDC42.
Boyer et al. (2011) concluded that mutant INF2 disrupts actin dynamics
in peripheral Schwann cells, leading to disturbed myelin formation and
maintenance and resulting in CMT.

FOCAL SEGMENTAL GLOMERULOSCLEROSIS 5
INF2, SER186PRO

In affected members of 2 large Canadian families segregating autosomal
dominant focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS5; 613237), Brown et
al. (2010) identified a heterozygous alteration in exon 4 of the INF2
gene, resulting in a ser186-to-pro (S186P) substitution at a conserved
residue within the autoinhibitory DID region. Transfection studies in
cultured podocytes showed a slightly more diffuse distribution of INF2
with a more vermiform appearance than wildtype, and less prominent
stress fibers and cortical actin compared to wildtype. The mutation was
not found in 282 controls. Age at diagnosis in the 2 families ranged
from 12 years to 67 years; 12 of 28 affected individuals developed
end-stage renal disease, with age of onset ranging from 20 years to 67
years.

identified a heterozygous alteration in exon 4 of the INF2 gene,
resulting in an arg218-to-gln (R218Q) substitution at a conserved
residue within the DID. Structural modeling revealed that the R218
residue lies close to the DAD-binding region of the DID, and
transfection studies in cultured podocytes showed a finer, more diffuse
distribution of INF2 and less prominent stress fibers and cortical actin
with mutant compared to wildtype INF2. The mutation was not found in 682

In 2 African-American brothers with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis
(FSGS5; 613237), Brown et al. (2010) identified a heterozygous
alteration in exon 4 of the INF2 gene, resulting in an arg218-to-trp
(R218W) substitution at a conserved residue within the autoinhibitory
DID region. Structural modeling revealed that the R218 residue lies
close to the DAD-binding region of the DID. The mutation was not found

In affected members of 2 large families segregating autosomal dominant
focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS5; 613237), Brown et al. (2010)
identified a heterozygous alteration in exon 4 of the INF2 gene,
resulting in an arg214-to-his (R214H) substitution at a conserved
residue within the autoinhibitory DID region. Structural modeling
revealed that the R214 residue lies close to the DAD-binding region of
the DID. The mutation was not found in 282 controls. Age at diagnosis in
the 2 families ranged from 12 years to 72 years; 4 of 12 affected
individuals developed end-stage renal disease, with age of onset ranging
from 17 years to 60 years.

INF2, LEU42PRO

In a sister and brother with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS5;
613237), Brown et al. (2010) identified a heterozygous alteration in
exon 2 of the INF2 gene, resulting in a leu42-to-pro (L42P) substitution
at a conserved residue within the autoinhibitory DID region. Their
affected father was also heterozygous for the mutation, which was not
found in 341 controls. Diagnosis in this family occurred between 11 to
13 years of age, and all 3 affected individuals developed end-stage
renal disease by 13 to 14 years of age.

glomerulosclerosis, Boyer et al. (2011) identified a de novo
heterozygous 310T-C transition in exon 2 of the INF2 gene, resulting in
a cys104-to-arg (C104R) substitution in a highly conserved residue in
the N-terminal diaphanous-inhibitory domain (DID). The mutation was not
found in 670 control chromosomes. The same residue was mutated in
another patient (C104F; 610982.0007) and in affected members of a family

transversion in exon 2 of the INF2 gene, resulting in a cys104-to-phe
(C104F) substitution in a highly conserved residue in the N-terminal DID
domain. The mutation was not found in 670 control chromosomes. The same

in a cys104-to-trp (C104W) substitution in a highly conserved residue in
the N-terminal DID domain. The mutation was not found in 670 control
chromosomes. The same residue was mutated in 2 other unrelated patients
with sporadic disease (C104R, 610982.0006 and C104F, 610982.0007).

In 2 unrelated Caucasian patients from Portugal and France,
respectively, with CMTDIE (614455), Boyer et al. (2011) identified a
heterozygous 383T-C transition in exon 2 of the INF2 gene, resulting in

600493	TITLE *600493 EGF-LIKE MODULE-CONTAINING, MUCIN-LIKE HORMONE RECEPTOR 1; EMR1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Proteins with 7 transmembrane segments define a superfamily of receptors
sharing the same topology: an extracellular N terminus, 3
extramembranous loops on either side of the plasma membrane, and a
cytoplasmic C-terminal tail. Upon ligand binding, cytoplasmic portions
of the activated receptor interact with heterotrimeric G coupled
proteins to induce various second messengers. One family that is
composed exclusively of receptors to peptide hormones is recognized on
the basis of homologous primary amino acid sequences. Baud et al. (1995)
studied a cDNA extracted from a neural ectodermal cDNA library that
predicts an 886-amino acid protein with 3 distinct domains. The domain
comprising the C-terminal third of the protein contains the 7
hydrophobic segments and characteristic residues that allow the protein
to be readily aligned with the various hormone receptors in the family.
At the N terminus of the predicted mature protein, there are 6 EGF-like
modules which are separated from the transmembrane segments by a
serine/threonine-rich domain, a feature reminiscent of mucin-like,
single-span, integral membrane glycoproteins with adhesive properties.
Because of its unique characteristics, Baud et al. (1995) designated
this putative EGF module-containing, mucin-like hormone receptor EMR1.

GENE FUNCTION

Schulz et al. (2012) investigated macrophage development in the mouse
and found that transcription factor Myb (189990) was required for the
development of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and all CD11b(high)
monocytes and macrophages, but was dispensable for yolk sac (YS)
macrophages and for the development of YS-derived F4/80(bright)
macrophages in several tissues, such as liver Kupffer cells, epidermal
Langerhans calls, and microglia--cell populations that all can persist
in adult mice independently of HSCs. EMR1 is the human homolog of mouse
F4/80. Schulz et al. (2012) concluded that their results defined a
lineage of tissue macrophages that derive from the yolk sac and are
genetically distinct from HSC progeny.

MAPPING

By Southern analysis of a panel of somatic cell hybrids and by
fluorescence in situ hybridization, Baud et al. (1995) assigned the EMR1
gene to 19p13.3. McKnight et al. (1997) mapped the mouse Emr1 gene to
the distal region of chromosome 17.

604334	TITLE *604334 UBIQUITIN-SPECIFIC PROTEASE 6; USP6
;;TRE2 ONCOGENE; TRE2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The TRE locus was first isolated from NIH 3T3 cells transfected with
human Ewing sarcoma DNA (Nakamura et al., 1988). Huebner et al. (1988)
found that the locus is discontinuous in human cells and is composed of
3 major genetic elements originating 5-prime to 3-prime from human
chromosomes 5, 18, and 17. Nakamura et al. (1992) cloned transcripts
from the chromosome 17 portion of TRE from a cDNA library of cytoplasmic
poly(A) RNA from TRE-transfected NIH 3T3 tumor cells. They obtained a
novel cDNA, the 5-prime part of which overlapped the TRE transcript, and
named its locus of origin TRE2. The complete cDNA spans 8,201 bp and
possesses an unusually long noncoding region and a translatable region
with 2 open reading frames (ORF). In 1 cDNA clone, the presence of 2
insertion sequences suggested the possibility of alternative splicing.
Transfection-tumorigenicity assays with the ORFs subcloned into
expression vectors were positive for the ORF adjacent to the 5-prime
noncoding region and negative for the second, downstream ORF. Analysis
of the 786-amino acid sequence deduced from the 5-prime ORF predicted a
highly hydrophilic protein with 2 charge clusters suggesting nucleic
acid-binding properties. When used as a probe, the cloned sequence
detected RNA transcripts in a wide variety of human cancer cells
regardless of their lineage of origin from different tissues, but not in
human cells from normal tissue.

Gene duplication and domain accretion are thought to be the major
mechanism for the emergence of novel genes during evolution. Genomic
sequence analysis has demonstrated extensive amplification events during
the evolution of higher primates. Paulding et al. (2003) reported that
the USP6 oncogene is derived from the chimeric fusion of 2 genes, USP32
(607740) and TBC1D3 (607741). USP32 is an ancient highly conserved gene,
whereas TBC1D3 is derived from a recent segmental duplication that is
absent in most other mammals and shows rapid amplification and dispersal
through the primate lineage. The chimeric gene USP6 exists only in the
hominoid lineage of primates and arose as recently as 21 to 33 million
years ago, after proliferation of the TBC1D3 segmental duplication in
the primate lineage. Paulding et al. (2003) determined that the
full-length USP6 gene encodes a 1,406-amino acid protein. Amino acids 1
to 496 are derived from TBC1D3 and encompass a TBC domain. Amino acids
501 to 1406 are derived from USP32 and encompass a ubiquitin-specific
protease domain. In contrast to the broad expression patterns of USP32
and TBC1D3, RT-PCR analysis showed that expression of USP6 is
testis-specific, a pattern proposed for genes implicated in the
emergence of reproductive barriers. The authors concluded that the
sudden emergence of chimeric proteins, such as that encoded by USP6, may
have contributed to hominoid speciation.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Paulding et al. (2003) determined that the
USP6 gene contains 30 exons and spans at least 47 kb. Exons 1 to 14 are
derived from the TBC1D3 parental gene, and exons 15 to 30 are derived
from the USP32 parental gene.

MAPPING

By chromosomal in situ hybridization, Nakamura et al. (1992) mapped the
TRE2 gene to 17q11. However, by genomic sequence analysis, Paulding et
al. (2003) mapped the USP6 gene to chromosome 17p13.

609240	TITLE *609240 GERM CELL-SPECIFIC GENE 2; GSG2
;;HAPLOID GERM CELL-SPECIFIC NUCLEAR PROTEIN KINASE; HASPIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

While examining transcription of the integrin alpha-E gene (ITGAE;
604682) in tissues that do not express ITGAE protein, Higgins (2001)
identified the GSG2 gene, which they called haspin. Haspin is
transcribed from the opposite strand of intron 26 of the ITGAE gene. By
5-prime RACE of testis total RNA, Higgins (2001) cloned haspin cDNA. The
deduced 798-amino acid protein contains a C-terminal kinase domain and a
potential nuclear localization signal. The mouse and human haspin
proteins share 66% amino acid identity overall, with 83% identity in the
C-terminal portion. Northern blot analysis detected a major 3.0-kb
transcript and a minor 4.0-kb transcript in testis. Expression was also
detected in adult thymus and bone marrow, with weaker expression in
adult prostate, intestine, lung, spleen, and lymph node. Haspin
expression was detected in fetal liver, skin, kidney, and small
intestine, and in all proliferating cell lines tested, particularly in
B- and T-cell lines. Expression was not detected in nonproliferating
cells.

Using mouse haspin cDNA to probe a human testis cDNA library, Tanaka et
al. (2001) cloned haspin. The deduced 798-amino acid protein has an
N-terminal basic region, a C-terminal leucine zipper, and a protein
kinase domain similar to CDC2 kinase (116940), as well as several
potential phosphorylation sites. Northern blot analysis detected a major
2.8-kb transcript and a minor 4.2-kb transcript expressed exclusively in
testis. Western blot analysis of human testis lysates detected a protein
with an apparent molecular mass of 88 kD. Fluorescence-tagged haspin was
expressed in punctate subnuclear foci in transfected human embryonic
kidney cells.

GENE FUNCTION

By assaying human embryonic kidney cells transfected with haspin cDNA,
Tanaka et al. (2001) demonstrated that haspin has protein kinase
activity.

Histone H3 (see 602810) is phosphorylated on thr3 during prophase of
mitotic cells, and it is dephosphorylated during anaphase. Dai et al.
(2005) found that haspin phosphorylated H3 thr3 in human cell lines in
vitro. Depletion of haspin by RNA interference revealed that haspin was
required for H3 thr3 phosphorylation in mitotic cells. In addition to
its chromosomal association, haspin associated with centrosomes and
spindles during mitosis. Haspin RNA interference caused misalignment of
metaphase chromosomes, and haspin overexpression delayed progression
through early mitosis. Dai et al. (2005) concluded that haspin is a
member of a group of kinases that integrate regulation of chromosome and
spindle function during mitosis and meiosis.

Wang et al. (2010) showed that phosphorylation of histone H3 threonine-3
(H3T3ph) by haspin is necessary for chromosomal passenger complex (CPC)
accumulation at centromeres and that the CPC subunit survivin (603352)
binds directly to H3T3ph. A nonbinding survivin-D70A/D71A mutant did not
support centromeric CPC concentration, and both haspin depletion and
survivin-D70A/D71A mutation diminished centromere localization of the
kinesin MCAK (604538) and the mitotic checkpoint response to taxol.
Survivin-D70A/D71A mutation and microinjection of H3T3ph-specific
antibody both compromised centromeric Aurora B (604970) functions but
did not prevent cytokinesis. Therefore, Wang et al. (2010) concluded
that H3T3ph generated by haspin positions the chromosomal passenger
complex at centromeres to regulate selected targets of Aurora B during
mitosis.

Kelly et al. (2010) demonstrated that H3T3ph is directly recognized by
an evolutionarily conserved binding pocket in the BIR domain of the CPC
subunit survivin. This binding mediates recruitment of the CPC to
chromosomes and the resulting activation of its kinase subunit Aurora B.
Consistently, modulation of the kinase activity of haspin, which
phosphorylates H3T3, leads to defects in the Aurora B-dependent
processes of spindle assembly and inhibition of nuclear reformation.
Kelly et al. (2010) concluded that their findings established a direct
cellular role for mitotic H3T3 phosphorylation, which is read and
translated by the CPC to ensure accurate cell division.

Yamagishi et al. (2010) showed that phosphorylation of H3T3 mediated by
haspin cooperates with bub1 (602452)-mediated histone 2A-serine-121
(H2A-S121) phosphorylation in targeting the CPC to the inner centromere
in fission yeast and human cells. Phosphorylated H3T3 promotes
nucleosome binding of survivin, whereas phosphorylated H2A-S121
facilitates the binding of shugoshin (609168), the centromeric CPC
adaptor. Haspin colocalizes with cohesin by associating with Pds5 (see
613200), whereas bub1 localizes at kinetochores. Thus, Yamagishi et al.
(2010) concluded that the inner centromere is defined by intersection of
2 histone kinases.

GENE STRUCTURE

Higgins (2001) determined that haspin is an intronless gene transcribed
from a bidirectional promoter that also generates an
alternatively-spliced ITGAE transcript. The 5-prime end is surrounded by
a CpG island, and the 3-prime UTR contains an Alu-J element. The
promoter region contains binding sites for E2F (see 189971), AP2
(107580), and Sp1 (189906). The human and mouse haspin genes both have
features of retroposons.

MAPPING

Higgins (2001) and Tanaka et al. (2001) mapped the haspin gene to
chromosome 17p13, where it lies on the opposite strand within intron 26
of the ITGAE gene.

600365	TITLE *600365 ACTIVE BCR-RELATED GENE; ABR
DESCRIPTION Heisterkamp et al. (1989) described an active BCR-related gene (ABR)
that they identified based on its homology with the BCR gene (151410)
located on chromosome 22. BCR is involved in reciprocal translocations
with the ABL oncogene (189980) on chromosome 9 in Philadelphia
chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia. Heisterkamp et al.
(1993) mapped the ABR gene to 17p13.3 by in situ hybridization
techniques. McDonald et al. (1994) found that the ABR locus was deleted
in 7 of 8 informative cases of medulloblastoma. Using pulsed field gel
electrophoresis, they localized a polymorphic marker of the ABR gene to
within 220 kb of D17S34. A cosmid contig constructed in this region was
used to demonstrate by fluorescence in situ hybridization that the
5-prime to 3-prime transcriptional orientation of the ABR gene is toward
the telomere.

123834	TITLE *123834 CYCLIN D3; CCND3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using murine cDNA clones for 3 cyclin D genes that are normally
expressed during the G1 phase of the cell cycle, Inaba et al. (1992)
cloned the cognate human genes. Motokura et al. (1992) also cloned the
CCND3 gene. Xiong et al. (1992) cloned CCND3 and found that all 3 human
D-type cyclin genes encode small (33-34 kD) proteins that share an
average of 57% identity over the entire coding region and 78% in the
cyclin box. The D-type cyclins are most closely related to cyclin A (39%
identity) and cyclin E (36%), followed by cyclin B (29%) and cyclin C
(21%).

GENE FUNCTION

Motokura et al. (1992) found that in normal human mammary epithelial
cells synchronized by growth factor deprivation and subsequent growth
factor stimulation, PRAD1/cyclin D1 (CCND1; 168461) expression peaked in
G1 and declined before the S phase, while cyclin D3 expression rose
later in G1 and remained elevated in S.

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Shen et al. (2004) identified EIF3S12
(609596) as a binding partner of cyclin D3. The interaction was mediated
by the C terminus of cyclin D3. GST pull-down experiments and transient
transfections showed that EIF3S12 and cyclin D3 bound both in vitro and
in vivo, and EIF3S12 did not bind cyclin D1 or D2 (CCND2; 123833).
Immunofluorescence revealed EIF3S12 distributed in the nucleus and
cytoplasm in a pattern that overlapped with that of cyclin D3. In
addition, overexpression of cyclin D3 upregulated the translational
activity in HeLa cells in a dose-dependent manner.

GENE STRUCTURE

Inaba et al. (1992) determined that all 3 cyclin D genes are interrupted
by an intron at the same position.

Wang et al. (1996) showed that the mouse cyclin D3 gene contains 5 exons
spanning about 7 kb of genomic DNA. They confirmed the activity of the
gene promoter by linking the CCND3 1,681-bp 5-prime region to a reporter
gene and transiently transfecting various cell lines. Greatest
expression of the reporter gene was detected in cell lines that normally
expressed high levels of endogenous cyclin D3 mRNA.

MAPPING

By analysis of somatic cell hybrids containing different human
chromosomes and by fluorescence in situ hybridization to metaphase
spreads from normal peripheral blood lymphocytes, Inaba et al. (1992)
assigned the CCND3 gene to 6p21. Motokura et al. (1992) mapped the gene
to chromosome 6 by use of human/rodent hybrids. Xiong et al. (1992)
mapped the CCND3 gene to 6p21 by fluorescence in situ hybridization.

Xiong et al. (1992) identified a pseudogene corresponding to CCND2 and
one corresponding to CCND3 (123834). Inaba et al. (1992) found that
pseudogenes containing sequences related to cyclin D2 and cyclin D3 map
to 12p13 and 6p21, respectively.

ANIMAL MODEL

Kozar et al. (2004) tested the requirement for D-cyclins in mouse
development and in proliferation by generating mice lacking all
D-cyclins. Ccnd1 -/- Ccnd2 -/- Ccnd3 -/- mice developed until mid/late
gestation and died due to heart abnormalities combined with severe
anemia. The authors found that D-cyclins were critically required for
expansion of hematopoietic stem cells. In contrast, cyclin D-deficient
fibroblasts proliferated nearly normally, but showed increased
requirement for mitogenic stimulation in cell cycle reentry.
Proliferation of Ccnd1 -/- Ccnd2 -/- Ccnd3 -/- cells was resistant to
inhibition by p16(INK4a) (600160), but it critically depended on CDK2
(116953). Cells lacking D-cyclins displayed reduced susceptibility to
oncogenic transformation.

610583	TITLE *610583 ANKYRIN REPEAT DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 6; ANKRD6
;;KIAA0957;;
DIVERSIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1999) cloned ANKRD6, which they designated
KIAA0957. The cDNA contains a repetitive element in the 3-prime UTR. The
deduced 692-amino acid protein showed some homology with ankyrin (ANK1;
612641). RT-PCR ELISA detected moderate expression in ovary, with low
expression in heart, whole brain, and liver, and no expression in other
adult tissues or in fetal brain and liver. In specific brain regions
examined, amygdala had moderate expression and all other brain regions
had little to no expression.

Using conductin (AXIN2; 604025) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a
mouse embryo cDNA library, Schwarz-Romond et al. (2002) cloned Ankrd6,
which they called diversin. The deduced 712-amino acid protein contains
8 N-terminal ankyrin repeats, a central domain, and a C-terminal domain.

GENE FUNCTION

By coimmunoprecipitation assays and yeast 2-hybrid analysis,
Schwarz-Romond et al. (2002) showed that the central domain of mouse
diversin interacted with human casein kinase-1E (CSNK1E; 600863) and the
C-terminal domain interacted with conductin or Axin1 (603816).
Coimmunoprecipitation analysis showed that diversin and Gsk3-beta
(GSK3B; 605004) exist in triple complexes with full-length dimeric
conductin. Schwarz-Romond et al. (2002) found that dimeric conductin
could concomitantly bind diversin and Gsk3b and that monomeric conductin
could bind either diversin or Gsk3b. Expression of diversin in human
embryonic kidney cells enhanced degradation of beta-catenin (CTNNB1;
116806), and degradation was blocked by a proteasome inhibitor. They
showed that diversin was expressed maternally in zebrafish embryos and
was involved in JNK (MAPK8; 601158) activation and gastrulation
movements. They further showed that diversin suppressed Wnt signals
mediated by the beta-catenin pathway and stimulated signaling via Jnk.
Schwarz-Romond et al. (2002) concluded that diversin is an essential
component of the Wnt signaling pathway and acts as a molecular switch.

Moeller et al. (2006) found that diversin controlled fusion of heart
precursors in zebrafish embryos in addition to controlling gastrulation
movement. Diversin directly interacted with dishevelled (DVL1; 601365)
via its ankyrin repeats, and this interaction was necessary and
sufficient to mediate noncanonical Wnt signaling. Diversin also affected
planar cell polarity in Drosophila, which is controlled by the
noncanonical Wnt signaling pathway.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the ANKRD6
gene to chromosome 6 (TMAP RH46749).

ANIMAL MODEL

By morpholino-based gene ablation in zebrafish, Schwarz-Romond et al.
(2002) showed that diversin was crucial for axis formation, which
depends on beta-catenin signaling.

612835	TITLE *612835 PHOSPHOLIPASE C, ETA-1; PLCH1
;;PHOSPHOLIPASE C LIKE-3; PLCL3;;
KIAA1069
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

PLCH1 is a member of the PLC-eta family of the phosphoinositide-specific
phospholipase C (PLC) superfamily of enzymes that cleave
phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) to generate second
messengers inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG)
(Hwang et al., 2005).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Kikuno et al. (1999) cloned a partial PLCH1 cDNA, which they
designated KIAA1069. RT-PCR analysis detected low expression in brain,
testis, and ovary, as well as in amygdala, cerebellum, caudate nucleus,
subthalamic nucleus, thalamus, spinal cord, and fetal brain.

By PCR to extend the KIAA1069 cDNA previously reported by Kikuno et al.
(1999), Hwang et al. (2005) cloned PLCH1 and identified 3 splice
variants. The deduced 1,002-amino acid PLCH1 isoform has a calculated
molecular mass of 115 kD and shares similarity with other PLC family
members. Northern blot analysis of human tissues detected a 7.4-kb
transcript in brain and lung. Western blot analysis of mouse tissues
detected Plch1 protein exclusively in nerve tissues such as cerebrum,
cerebellum, and the spinal cord. In contrast to the mRNA data, Plch1
protein was not detected in lung. In situ hybridization detected mouse
Plch1 mRNA expression throughout the brain with high expression in
neuronal, cell-enriched regions. Fluorescence microscopy of HEK293 cells
localized PLCH1 to the cytosol and membrane but not in the nucleus; in
mouse brain tissues, Plch1 was detected in all cytosolic and membrane
fractions.

By EST database analysis using Pseudomonas fluorescens
phosphocholine-specific phospholipase C sequence as probe, Stewart et
al. (2005) identified partial PLCH1. The 1,035-amino acid splice variant
contains a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, an EF-hand domain, a
predicted Ca(2+)-requiring catalytic site containing X and Y domains,
and a C2 domain. PLCH1 lacks a signal peptide. In comparison to
phospholipase C delta-1 (PLCD1; 602142), PLCH1 contains conserved
residues known to be involved in substrate binding and catalysis.

GENE FUNCTION

Hwang et al. (2005) demonstrated that PLCH1 displayed Ca(2+)-dependent
phospholipase C activity, catalyzing the hydrolysis of PtdIns(4,5)P2.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hwang et al. (2005) determined that the PLCH1 gene contains 25 exons
spanning over 300 kb and delineated 3 PLCH1 isoforms. The 1,002 residue
isoform consists of 23 exons, whereas a longer 1,693 residue isoform
skips exon 23 and incorporates a long exon 24. The 1,035 residue isoform
reported by Stewart et al. (2005) skips exon 23 and 24 and links exon 22
with exon 25.

MAPPING

By database analysis, Stewart et al. (2005) mapped the PLCH1 gene to
chromosome 3q25.31.

;;XGPT1; XGALT1;;
GALACTOSYLTRANSFERASE I
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Galactosyltransferase I (UDP-galactose:O-beta-D-xylosylprotein
4-beta-D-galactosyltransferase; EC 2.4.1.133) is involved in the
synthesis of the glycosaminoglycan-protein linkage in proteoglycans
(Okajima et al., 1999).

CLONING

By searching an EST database for orthologs of C. elegans sqv3, followed
by RT-PCR of a colon cancer cDNA library and 5-prime RACE, Okajima et
al. (1999) cloned human BGALT7, which encodes xylosylprotein
4-beta-galactosyltransferase. The deduced 327-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 37.4 kD. B4GALT7 has a hydrophobic segment
in its N-terminal region, predicting that the protein assumes a type II
transmembrane topology. It also has 1 N-glycosylation site.

GENE STRUCTURE

Almeida et al. (1999) determined that the B4GALT7 gene contains 6 exons.

MAPPING

Almeida et al. (1999) found that ESTs from B4GALT7 matched sequences in
a Unigene cluster (Hs.45208) that had been mapped to chromosome
5q35.1-q35.3. By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Kuroiwa et al.
(2000) assigned the B4GALT7 gene to 5q35.2-q35.3.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a variety of possible galactose acceptor substrates, Okajima et
al. (1999) showed that human B4GALT7 expressed in mouse fibroblasts had
significant activity with p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-xylopyranoside, a primer
for glycosaminoglycan chain formation. Characterization of the product
revealed that galactose was added via beta-1,4 linkage.

In the progeroid type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (130070), Kresse et al.
(1987) found deficiency of galactosyltransferase I (xylosylprotein
4-beta-galactosyltransferase).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Okajima et al. (1999) and Almeida et al. (1999) independently performed
mutation analysis of the B4GALT7 gene in fibroblasts from the patient
with progeroid Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDSP1; 130070) reported by Kresse
et al. (1987). They found that the patient was compound heterozygous for
2 mutations in the XGPT1 gene (604327.0001-604327.0002), which were
present in the mother and the father, respectively.

In 2 affected members of a large consanguineous Arab family with the
progeroid form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Faiyaz-Ul-Haque et al. (2004)
identified a homozygous arg270-to-cys mutation in the B4GALT7 gene
(R270C; 604327.0003).

independently found compound heterozygosity for ala186-to-asp and
leu206-to-pro (604327.0002) mutations in the B4GALT7 gene. The father
was heterozygous for the leu206-to-pro mutation; the mother was

B4GALT7, ARG270CYS

In 2 affected members of a large consanguineous Arab family with the
progeroid type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDSP1; 130070),
Faiyaz-Ul-Haque et al. (2004) identified homozygosity for an 808C-T
transition in exon 5 of the B4GALT7 gene, resulting in an arg270-to-cys
(R270C) substitution in the catalytically active extracellular
C-terminal domain. The authors noted that the affected members in this
family exhibited somewhat milder skin changes than those previously
described.

Gotte et al. (2008) showed that R270C mutant fibroblasts produced
heparan sulfate with a reduced level of sulfation compared with normal
control fibroblasts. Altered heparan sulfate resulted in several changes
of the cellular phenotype, including delayed wound repair, altered
fibronectin adhesion, actin stress fiber and filopodia formation, and
collagen gel contraction.

601833	TITLE *601833 ALLOGRAFT INFLAMMATORY FACTOR 1; AIF1
;;INTERFERON RESPONSE TRANSCRIPT 1; IRT1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Autieri (1996) cloned a full-length cDNA of AIF1 (for allograft
inflammatory factor-1) from a human peripheral blood lymphocyte cDNA
library. The corresponding rat gene had been shown by differential
display PCR to undergo increased expression in response to vascular
injury incurred during balloon angioplasty. Sequence analysis revealed
that AIF1 encodes a 143-amino acid polypeptide 4 amino acids shorter
than that of rat Aif1; differences in this respect reside primarily at
the C terminus. Amino acid motif analysis of AIF1 revealed a consensus
EF-hand helix loop domain that is a conserved feature of calcium-binding
proteins. Autieri (1996) showed that Aif1 expression is elevated 8- to
9-fold in the 3 days following balloon angioplasty. The author also
demonstrated that the constitutive level of AIF1 mRNA in peripheral
blood lymphocytes can be augmented by the mitogen phytohemagglutinin A
(PHA). The author concluded that AIF1 represents a cytokine-inducible,
tissue-specific, and highly conserved transcript transiently expressed
in response to vascular trauma. Northern blot analysis revealed that
AIF1 is expressed in a variety of human tissues, with highest expression
in tissues of lymphoid origin, in particular, spleen, blood lymphocytes,
and thymus.

GENE FUNCTION

Autieri and Agrawal (1998) identified IRT1 by stimulating vascular
smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) with various cytokines. Northern blot
analysis revealed wide but variable constitutive expression of a 1.3-kb
IRT1 transcript in human tissues and in VSMCs stimulated with
gamma-interferon (IFNG; 147570) but not with other cytokines or growth
factors. IRT1 expression was downregulated in proliferating T cells.
Expression of IRT1 was stimulated by balloon angioplasty in rat carotid
arteries, possibly due to the presence of Ifng-producing T lymphocytes
at the injury site. The predicted protein contains a leucine zipper
motif, a hydrophobic region, a nuclear localization sequence, and 2
potential phosphorylation sites. Overexpression of IRT1 in VMSCs
resulted in altered morphology and inhibition of cell growth.

Using in vitro binding and coimmunoprecipitation assays, Autieri et al.
(2003) determined that AIF1 interacts with actin. In unstimulated VSMCs,
AIF1 colocalized with F-actin, but translocated to lamellipodia upon
PDGF (see 190040) stimulation. VSMCs stably transduced with AIF1
retrovirus migrated 2.6-fold more rapidly in response to PDGF than
control cells. AIF1 colocalized with RAC1 (602048), and AIF1-transduced
VSMCs showed a constitutive and enhanced activation of RAC1. Autieri et
al. (2003) concluded that AIF1 binds and polymerizes F-actin and
regulates RAC1 activity and VSMC migration.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the AIF1
gene to chromosome 6 (TMAP SHGC-132025).

The AIF1 gene resides in the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) cluster of
genes located in the region represented by the human major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) on 6p21.3 (Allcock et al., 2004).

602607	TITLE *602607 SOLUTE CARRIER FAMILY 22 (ORGANIC CATION TRANSPORTER), MEMBER 1; SLC22A1
;;ORGANIC CATION TRANSPORTER 1; OCT1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Polyspecific organic cation transporters in the liver, kidney, and
intestine are critical for elimination of many endogenous amines as well
as a wide array of drugs and environmental toxins. Grundemann et al.
(1994) isolated a cDNA from rat kidney, which they named OCT1 (organic
cation transporter), that induced organic cation uptake when expressed
in Xenopus oocytes. On Northern blots, rat OCT1 was expressed as 3 mRNAs
of 1.9, 3.4, and 4.8 kb in kidney, liver, intestine, and colon.

Using PCR of liver cDNA with primers based on the homologous rat gene,
Zhang et al. (1997) cloned human OCT1 cDNA. The predicted 554-amino acid
human protein has 12 putative transmembrane domains and is 78% identical
to rat OCT1 protein. On Northern blots, OCT1 was expressed as a 2-kb
mRNA only in liver, although a weaker 2.5-kb mRNA was seen in several
other tissues, including kidney. However, no expression was detected in
intestine, lung, or pancreas. On SDS-PAGE, Zhang et al. (1997) observed
that OCT1 migrated as a 47-kD protein, smaller than its predicted size
of 61 kD. However, Zhang et al. (1997) noted that anomalous migration of
membrane proteins such as OCT1 is not unusual.

By PCR of kidney cortex cDNA, Gorboulev et al. (1997) cloned human OCT1
and OCT2 (602608) and found that OCT1 predicted a 553-amino acid
protein. By RT-PCR they observed that OCT1 was transcribed in all
tissues tested, although on Northern blots it was expressed mainly in
liver.

Hayer et al. (1999) reported the cloning of 4 human OCT1 isoforms: a
long form and 3 short forms. All 4 variants were identified in a human
glioma cell line, whereas only 2 isoforms were found in human liver
cDNA. The long form represents the full-length OCT1 gene, since the
sequence of this clone is more than 99% identical to previously cloned
cDNAs. Elucidation of the gene structure of human OCT1 demonstrated that
the other isolated isoforms are alternatively spliced variants. When
stably expressed in human embryonic kidney cells, only the full-length
OCT1 cDNA mediated a transporter function.

GENE FUNCTION

Grundemann et al. (1994) performed functional assays which suggested
that OCT1 is the main organic cation uptake system in hepatocytes and
has common features with organic cation uptake over the basolateral
membrane of renal proximal tubules.

Zhang et al. (1997) observed that Xenopus oocytes expressing OCT1 showed
increased cation uptake.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hayer et al. (1999) determined that the OCT1 gene contains 7 exons.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid PCR mapping followed by fluorescence in situ
hybridization, Koehler et al. (1997) mapped the SLC22A1 gene to 6q26.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

As part of a pharmacogenetics project that sought to identify genes that
determine drug response, Leabman et al. (2003) screened for variation in
the set of 24 genes encoding membrane transporters. They identified
variants by screening an ethnically diverse collection of genomic DNA
samples, derived from a total of 494 chromosomes. By combining
population-genetic and phylogenetic analyses, they were able to identify
amino acid residues and protein domains that may be important for human
fitness. A large sample set made it possible for them also to obtain
information about rare variants. The 24 membrane transporters with
potential roles in drug response were grouped based on transporter
family: e.g., OCT1, OCT2 (602608), and OCT3 (604842) belonged to the
SLC6 family; CNT1 (606207) and CNT2 (606208) belonged to the SLC28
family. Leabman et al. (2003) identified 680 SNPs, of which 175 were
synonymous and 155 caused amino acid changes, and 29 small insertions
and deletions. Amino acid diversity in transmembrane domains (TMDs) was
significantly lower than in loop domains, suggesting that TMDs have
special functional constraints. Leabman et al. (2003) used allele
frequency distribution to evaluate different scoring systems for their
ability to predict which SNPs affect function. Their underlying
assumption was that alleles that are functionally deleterious will be
selected against and thus underrepresented at high frequencies and
overrepresented at low frequencies. They found that evolutionary
conservation of orthologous sequences, as assessed by evolutionarily
conserved/evolutionarily unconserved and SIFT (Sorts Intolerant From
Tolerant), was the best predictor of allele frequency distribution and
hence of function. European Americans were found to have an excess of
high frequency alleles in comparison to African Americans, consistent
with a historic bottleneck. In addition, African Americans exhibited a
much higher frequency of population-specific medium-frequency alleles
than did European Americans.

Because OCT1 interacts with a variety of structurally diverse organic
cations, including clinically useful drugs as well as toxic substances,
it is an important determinant of systemic exposure to many xenobiotics.
To understand the genetic basis of extensive interindividual differences
in xenobiotic disposition, Shu et al. (2003) functionally characterized
15 protein-altering variants of the human liver organic cation
transporter, OCT1, in Xenopus oocytes. All variants that reduced or
eliminated function altered evolutionarily conserved amino acid
residues. In general, variants with decreased function had amino acid
substitutions that resulted in more radical chemical changes (higher
Grantham values) and were less evolutionarily favorable (lower BLOSUM62
values) than variants that maintained function. A variant with increased
function (OCT1-S14F) changed an amino acid residue such that the human
protein matched the consensus of the OCT1 mammalian orthologs. The
results indicated that changes at evolutionarily conserved positions of
OCT1 are strong predictors of decreased function and suggested that a
combination of evolutionary conservation and chemical change might be a
stronger predictor of function.

Shu et al. (2007) investigated the role of OCT1 in the therapeutic
effects of the drug metformin, which is widely used in the treatment of
type 2 diabetes (see 125853) but to which patients show an extremely
variable response. In mouse hepatocytes, deletion of Oct1 resulted in a
reduction in the effects of metformin on AMPK (see 602739)
phosphorylation and gluconeogenesis; in Oct1-deficient mice, the
glucose-lowering effects of metformin were completely abolished. Glucose
tolerance tests in healthy volunteers showed significantly lower effects
of metformin in individuals carrying reduced-function OCT1
polymorphisms, including the common 420del and R61C variants. Shu et al.
(2007) concluded that OCT1 is important for metformin therapeutic action
and that genetic variation in OCT1 may contribute to variation in
response to the drug.

610885	TITLE *610885 ESSENTIAL MEIOTIC ENDONUCLEASE 1, S. POMBE, HOMOLOG OF, 1; EME1
;;EME1, S. POMBE, HOMOLOG OF, 1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

EME1 and MUS81 (606591) form an endonuclease complex that cleaves
branched DNA structures, especially those arising during stalled DNA
replication (Abraham et al., 2003).

CLONING

By searching for homologs of S. pombe Eme1, followed by PCR, Ciccia et
al. (2003) cloned EME1 and EME2 (610886). The deduced 583-amino acid
EME1 protein has a calculated molecular mass of 65 kD and shares 44%
identity with EME2.

Abraham et al. (2003) cloned mouse Eme1, which encodes a 570-amino acid
protein that shares 66% identity with human EME1. Northern blot analysis
detected expression of Eme1 in all embryonic and adult mouse tissues
examined.

GENE FUNCTION

Ciccia et al. (2003) showed that recombinant EME1 interacted with
recombinant MUS81. The heterodimer had DNA endonuclease activity against
3-prime flap and replication fork substrates, but the activity was much
lower against splayed arm or Holliday junction substrates. Neither EME1
nor MUS81 alone showed nuclease activity.

Abraham et al. (2003) found that the mouse Eme1/Mus81 heterodimer
preferentially cleaved 3-prime flap structures and replication forks
rather than Holliday junctions in vitro. Eme1 -/- mouse embryonic stem
cells exhibited no changes in viability, growth rate, or activation of
DNA damage-activated cell cycle checkpoints. However, loss of Eme1 led
to increased aneuploidy, increased sister chromatid exchange upon DNA
damage, and increased levels of spontaneous chromosomal abnormalities,
including breaks, fragments, chromosomal fusions, and dicentric
chromosomes. Compared with wildtype cells, Eme1 -/- cells showed a
2-fold increase in chromosomal abnormalities following treatment with
the DNA-crosslinking agent mitomycin C. Abraham et al. (2003) concluded
that EME1 plays a key role in DNA repair and maintenance of genome
integrity.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Ciccia et al. (2003) mapped the EME1 gene
to chromosome 17q21.3. Abraham et al. (2003) mapped the mouse Eme1 gene
to chromosome 11C.

;;ACYL CARRIER PROTEIN, MITOCHONDRIAL; ACP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The multisubunit NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) is the first
enzyme complex in the electron transport chain of mitochondria. Runswick
et al. (1991) reported that the bovine Sdap subunit of complex I is an
acyl carrier protein. Loeffen et al. (1998) stated that GenBank GENBANK
AF087660 represents the cDNA encoding the human homolog of Sdap.

Zhang et al. (2003) cloned human NDUFAB1, which they called
mitochondrial ACP. The deduced 156-amino acid protein has an N-terminal
cleavable mitochondrial localization signal. Fluorescence-tagged NDUFAB1
colocalized with a mitochondrial marker in transfected HeLa cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Smeitink and van den Heuvel (1999) reviewed the available molecular data
regarding the human nuclear-encoded complex I subunits.

GENE STRUCTURE

Zhang et al. (2003) determined that the NDUFAB1 gene contains 4 exons.

MAPPING

Using radiation hybrid analysis, Emahazion et al. (1998) mapped the
NDUFAB1 gene to 16p12.3-p12.1. By genomic sequence analysis, Zhang et
al. (2003) mapped the NDUFAB1 gene to chromosome 16p12.3.

606466	TITLE *606466 PML-RARA TARGET GENE ENCODING AN ADAPTOR MOLECULE 1; PRAM1
DESCRIPTION The t(15;17) translocation, found in 95% of acute promyelocytic leukemia
(APL; 612376), encodes a promyelocytic leukemia (PML; 102578)-retinoic
acid receptor-alpha (RARA; 180240) fusion protein. APL is successfully
treated with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), the effects of which are
mediated through PML-RARA in leukemia cells. PML-RARA may exert its
oncogenic effects by repressing the expression of RA-inducible genes
critical to myeloid differentiation.

CLONING

By applying subtraction cloning to an APL cell line treated with ATRA to
induce granulocytic differentiation, followed by EST database searching
and 5-prime RACE, Moog-Lutz et al. (2001) isolated a cDNA encoding
PRAM1. Sequence analysis predicted that the 718-amino acid PRAM1 protein
contains 8 N-terminal proline-rich repeats. Several proline residues are
clustered as type I or type II SH3 recognition motifs. The C terminus of
PRAM1 has group I SH2 domains as well as an SH3-like domain that is 57%
similar to that of FYB (602731). Northern blot analysis revealed
expression of PRAM1 in hematopoietic tissues and lung. Expression was
detectable in the NB4 APL line after ATRA treatment and in cells from
patients newly diagnosed with APL, but not in a mutant line that did not
express the PML-RARA protein. Immunoblot analysis showed ATRA-inducible
expression of a 97-kD protein, which is much higher than the predicted
79 kD. Immunoprecipitation analysis showed that in NB4 cells, PRAM1
associates with the constitutively expressed SLP76 (LCP2; 601603) as
well as with the ATRA-inducible SKAP-HOM (SKAP55R; 605215) and LYN
(165120) adaptor proteins. Moog-Lutz et al. (2001) concluded that PRAM1
is an adaptor protein expressed and regulated during myelopoiesis that
may be a target of the PML-RARA fusion protein, given that its
expression is inhibited by the fusion protein but superinduced by ATRA
interaction with that same protein.

607635	TITLE *607635 CARBOXYPEPTIDASE A4; CPA4
;;CPA3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using the mRNA differential display technique, Huang et al. (1999)
identified a novel protein, carboxypeptidase A4, that was upregulated in
a sodium butyrate-treated prostate cancer (176807) cell line. They
assembled a full-length CPA4 cDNA, which they had designated CPA3, by
use of 5-prime RACE. The deduced 421-amino acid CPA4 protein contains 2
zinc-binding signature domains of metallocarboxypeptidases and a
16-amino acid N-terminal signal peptide. The protein shares 63% and 61%
sequence identity with human and rat CPA2 (600688), respectively.
Northern blot analysis detected strong expression of a 3-kb CPA4
transcript in prostate cancer cell lines but no expression of the gene
in any of the human tissues tested. RT-PCR detected very low expression
of CPA4 in some normal tissues, including prostate.

GENE FUNCTION

Huang et al. (1999) found that trichostatin A as well as sodium
butyrate, both inhibitors of histone deacetylase, induced CPA4 mRNA
expression, suggesting that CPA4 gene induction is mediated by histone
hyperacetylation. They also demonstrated that the induction of CPA4 by
sodium butyrate was specifically inhibited by antisense p21(WAF1)
(CDKN1A; 116899).

Because of the expression pattern of CPA4 as well as its location at a
putative prostate cancer aggressiveness locus at chromosome 7q32 (Witte
et al., 2000), Kayashima et al. (2003) investigated its imprinting
status in fetal tissues and in adult benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH;
600082). RT-PCR using 4 intragenic polymorphisms as markers showed that
CPA4 is expressed preferentially from the maternal allele in fetal
heart, lung, liver, intestine, kidney, adrenal gland, and spleen, but
not in fetal brain. It is also preferentially expressed in BPH. These
findings suggested that CPA4 is imprinted and may be a strong candidate
gene for prostate cancer aggressiveness.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Pallares et al. (2005) described the structure of CPA4 in complex with
its endogenous inhibitor, LXN (609305). CPA4 is a compact protein
hollowed out in a funnel-like shape, with the active site at the bottom
of the funnel. In the CPA4/LXN complex, CPA4 is bound at the top of the
funnel by the interface of the N- and C-terminal subdomains of LXN. The
complex occludes a large contact surface but makes few contacts.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kayashima et al. (2003) determined that the CPA4 gene consists of 11
exons.

MAPPING

In a search for novel imprinted genes in the vicinity of the imprinted
gene MEST (601029) on chromosome 7q32, Kayashima et al. (2003)
identified the CPA4 gene in a cluster with other members of the
carboxypeptidase family, 200 kb centromeric to MEST.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

One or more imprinted genes on chromosome 7q32-qter have been postulated
to be involved in the interuterine growth retardation associated with
Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS; 180860) as 7 to 10% of patients have
maternal uniparental disomy (UPD). Bentley et al. (2003) found that the
imprinted region on 7q32 extends to the carboxypepidase A gene cluster.
SNP analysis by sequencing RT-PCR products of CPA1 (114850), CPA2, CPA4,
and CPA5 (609561) indicated preferential expression of CPA4 only. As
CPA4 has a potential role in cell proliferation and differentiation, 2
preferentially expressed copies of maternal UPD patients with SRS
syndrome would result in excess expression and could alter the growth
profiles of these subjects and give rise to intrauterine growth
restriction.

Because a locus for Silver-Russell syndrome had been proposed to be
located on 7q32 and involved in imprinting, Kayashima et al. (2003)
screened for mutations in the CPA4 gene in 10 SRS patients, but found
none.

300413	TITLE *300413 MUSCLEBLIND-LIKE PROTEIN 3; MBNL3
;;MUSCLEBLIND-LIKE PROTEIN, X-LINKED; MBXL
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MBNL3 belongs to a conserved family of RNA-binding proteins
characterized by 2 pairs of C3H-type zinc finger-related motifs. These
proteins function as target-specific regulators of pre-mRNA splicing (Ho
et al., 2004).

CLONING

By searching databases for homologs of human MBNL (MBNL1; 606516),
followed by 5-prime and 3-prime RACE, Fardaei et al. (2002) cloned human
MBNL2 (607327) and MBNL3, which they called MBLL and MBXL, respectively.
All 3 human genes show extensive alternative splicing. Northern blot
analysis showed that MBNL and MBLL were expressed in many adult human
tissues, whereas MBXL was expressed predominantly in placenta.

GENE FUNCTION

Myotonic dystrophy (DM1; 160900) is a complex neuromuscular disorder
associated with DNA expansion mutations in 2 different genes. In DM1 a
CTG repeat in the 3-prime-untranslated region of DMPK (605377) is
expanded, whereas in DM2 (602668) an intronic CCTG expansion occurs in
the ZNF9 gene (116955). Transcripts containing expanded repeats form
foci in the nuclei of DM1 and DM2 cells. Miller et al. (2000) and
Mankodi et al. (2001) showed that human proteins related to Drosophila
muscleblind colocalized with repeat foci in DM1 and DM2 cells. Fardaei
et al. (2002) found that green fluorescent protein-tagged versions of
human MBNL, MBLL, and MBXL colocalized with nuclear foci in DM1 and DM2
cells, suggesting that all 3 proteins may play a role in DM
pathophysiology.

By expressing fluorescence-tagged proteins in primary chicken skeletal
muscle cultures, Ho et al. (2004) showed that human MBNL1, MBNL2, and
MBNL3 repressed inclusion of exon 5 in chicken and human cardiac
troponin (cTNT, or TNNT2; 191045) minigenes and induced inclusion of
exon 11 in a human insulin receptor (IR, or INSR; 147670) minigene.
Depletion of MBNL1 in HeLa cells via small interfering RNA promoted exon
inclusion in cTNT, exon skipping in IR, and only minimal splicing
changes in a clathrin light chain B (CLTB; 118970) minigene. Ultraviolet
(UV) crosslinking and scanning mutagenesis studies identified 2
MBNL1-binding sites upstream of cTNT exon 5. Mutations within the
MBNL1-binding sites significantly reduced binding by MBNL1 and MBNL3 and
eliminated binding by MBNL2. Alignment of the MBNL1-binding sites in
chicken and human cTNT revealed a common MBNL-binding motif, YGCU(U/G)Y,
where Y represents U or C. Ho et al. (2004) noted that CELF proteins
(e.g., BRUNOL1, or TNRC4; 612678) induce inclusion of exon 5 in chicken
and human cTNT and exon skipping of human IR exon 11. They proposed that
MBNL and CELF proteins function antagonistically to regulate splicing in
specific target pre-mRNAs.

Lee et al. (2010) showed that Mbnl3 promoted exclusion of the beta exon
from Mef2a (600660) and Mef2d (600663) transcripts in C2C12 mouse muscle
cells, which antagonized muscle differentiation. UV crosslinking
experiments revealed that Mbnl3 selectively bound to Mef2d intron 7 and
silenced beta exon splicing during differentiation. Mutation of
cysteines within the 4 C3H motifs of Mbnl3 revealed a critical role of
the zinc finger domains in binding RNA. Expression of wildtype Mbnl3 led
to a significant decrease in Mef2d transcripts containing the beta exon.
Both a mouse cell culture model of myotonic dystrophy and skeletal and
cardiac muscle from myotonic dystrophy patients showed elevated
expression of MBNL3 mRNA, concomitant with significantly reduced levels
of MEF2D transcripts containing the beta exon. Lee et al. (2010)
concluded that upregulation of MBNL3 can contribute to the pathology of
myotonic dystrophy.

MAPPING

By database analysis, Fardaei et al. (2002) determined that the MBNL3
gene maps to the X chromosome.

Hartz (2012) mapped the MBNL3 gene to chromosome Xq26.2 based on an
alignment of the MBNL3 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK002178) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

609484	TITLE *609484 LY6/PLAUR DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 3; LYPD3
;;GPI-ANCHORED METASTASIS-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN C4.4A;;
C4.4A
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By screening a placenta cDNA library with rat Lypd3, Wurfel et al.
(2001) cloned human LYPD3, which they called C4.4A. The deduced
346-amino acid protein shares 81.8% amino acid identity with rat C4.4a
and has 6 N-glycosylation sites and a potential
glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchoring sequence. C4.4A shares
43.5% identity with uPA receptor (UPAR, or PLAUR; 173391), and both
proteins have 3 domains, a conserved uPA (PLAU; 191840) cleavage site
within the linker region between domains 1 and 2, and complete
conservation of all 17 cysteines. Northern blot analysis and RT-PCR of
several tissues detected C4.4A expression in placenta and skin. Weak
expression was detected in esophagus and peripheral blood mononuclear
cells, but not in peripheral blood-derived T cells. C4.4A was expressed
in a variety of tumor cell lines from different tissues and in primary
lung tumors and metastatic melanomas.

By Western blot analysis of placenta, Hansen et al. (2004) determined
that C4.4A has an apparent molecular mass of about 90 kD.
Immunohistochemical analysis detected C4.4A on amniotic membranes.
Membrane-associated C4.4A was also found on suprabasal keratinocytes in
chronic human wounds, but basal keratinocytes were negative. Recombinant
C4.4A was extensively modified by posttranslational glycosylation,
including 5 to 6 N-linked carbohydrates located in or close to the
second of 2 Ly6/uPAR/neurotoxin (see 606119) modules and 15 O-linked
carbohydrates clustered in a ser/thr/pro-rich region at the C terminus.
Hansen et al. (2004) also identified a highly protease-sensitive region
(tyr200 to arg204) between 2 clusters of N- and O-linked carbohydrates.

GENE FUNCTION

Fletcher et al. (2003) found C4.4A expression elevated in 7 primary
breast tumors compared with adjacent normal tissue. Yeast 2-hybrid
analysis of a breast cancer cDNA library showed that C4.4A interacted
with AG2 (AGR2; 606358) and AG3 (609482).

Hansen et al. (2004) found that C4.4a expression was upregulated in
migrating mouse keratinocytes during reepithelialization of incisional
skin wounds. Phorbol ester-induced hyperplasia of mouse skin was
accompanied by a significant induction of C4.4a in multilayered,
suprabasal keratinocytes.

MAPPING

By FISH, Wurfel et al. (2001) mapped the LYPD3 gene to chromosome
19q13.1-q13.2.

614942	TITLE *614942 PHOSPHATIDYLGLYCEROPHOSPHATE SYNTHASE 1; PGS1
;;PGP SYNTHASE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

PGS1 (EC 2.7.8.5) catalyzes the first committed step in cardiolipin (CL)
biosynthesis (Kawasaki et al., 1999).

CLONING

By searching a database for human ESTs encoding a protein similar to
yeast Pgs1, Kawasaki et al. (1999) identified PGS1. They cloned the
full-length hamster cDNA from a CHO cell library. The deduced 553-amino
acid hamster protein shares 30% identity with yeast Pgs1. Northern blot
analysis detected variable Pgs1 expression in mouse tissues, with
highest expression in testis, followed by liver and brain. Expression
was intermediate in skeletal muscle, heart, and lung, lowest in spleen,
and absent in kidney.

GENE FUNCTION

Kawasaki et al. (1999) had previously developed a temperature-sensitive
CHO mutant defective in PGP synthase activity that exhibited reduced
cellular content of PG and CL and abnormal mitochondrial morphology and
function. They found that transfection of hamster Pgs1 restored PG and
CL synthesis and corrected mitochondrial defects in mutant CHO cells.

MAPPING

Hartz (2012) mapped the PGS1 gene to chromosome 17q25.3 based on an
alignment of the PGS1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK M77859) with the genomic
sequence (GRCh37).

;;BETA-1,4-N-ACETYLGALACTOSAMINYLTRANSFERASE; GALGT;;
GalNAcT;;
GM2/GD2 SYNTHASE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The B4GALNT1 gene encodes beta-1,4-N-acetylgalactosaminyl transferase-1
(EC 2.4.1.92), an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of complex
gangliosides (G), which are mono- (M), di- (D), and tri- (T) sialic
acid-containing glycosphingolipids generated by sequential
glycosylations. Gangliosides are part of the larger family of
glycosphingolipids and are components of the synaptic plasma membrane
involved in synaptic plasticity, signal transduction, and endocytosis
and then are critical for central nervous system development. B4GALNT1
catalyzes the transfer of N-acetylgalactosamine into GM3, GD3, and
globotriaosylceramide by a beta-1,4 linkage (summary by Boukhris et al.,
2013).

CLONING

Nagata et al. (1992) used expression cloning to isolate the cDNA for
beta-1,4-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (GalNAcT), or G(M2)/G(D2)
synthase. The cDNA encodes a 561-amino acid polypeptide. Northern blot
analysis revealed that the gene is expressed as 2 differently sized
transcripts in all cells tested that expressed G(MS), G(D2), or both.
These findings indicate that the cDNAs catalyze the transfer of GalNAc
into G(M3) and G(D3) by a beta-1,4 linkage, resulting in the synthesis
of G(M2) and G(D2), respectively.

GENE STRUCTURE

Furukawa et al. (1996) examined the genomic structure of the human
GalNAcT gene and found that it contains more than 11 exons spanning over
8 kb of genomic DNA. They reported that the gene has at least 3 distinct
transcription initiation sites that may be involved in cell
type-specific gene expression.

MAPPING

By FISH, Furukawa et al. (1996) mapped the GALGT gene to 12q13.3. Hamlin
et al. (1998) mapped the GALGT and KIF5A (602821) genes to 12q13 by
FISH. They found that these genes are contained within the same
approximately 200-kb YAC insert as the GLI (165220) and DDIT3 (126337)
genes.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

By exome sequencing of 5 families with autosomal recessive spastic
paraplegia-26 (SPG26; 609195), Boukhris et al. (2013) identified 5
different homozygous mutations in the B4GALNT1 gene. The mutations
segregated with the disorder in the families and were not found in large
control databases. Subsequent analysis of this gene identified
pathogenic mutations in 2 of 65 additional probands with a similar
disorder. All mutations were truncating, except for 2 missense mutations
that occurred at highly conserved residues (see, e.g.,
601873.0001-601873.0005). No functional studies were performed. The
phenotype was characterized by onset in the first 2 decades of life of
gait abnormalities due to lower limb spasticity and muscle weakness.
Some patients had upper limb involvement. Additional features included
intellectual disability, peripheral neuropathy, dysarthria, cerebellar
signs, extrapyramidal signs, and cortical atrophy. The disorder was
slowly progressive.

ANIMAL MODEL

Takamiya et al. (1996) found that mice with a disrupted B4galnt1 gene
lacked all complex gangliosides, but did did not show any major
histologic defects in their nervous systems or in gross behavior.
Electrophysiologic studies showed a slight reduction in the neural
conduction velocity from the tibial nerve to the somatosensory cortex,
but not to the lumbar spine. The findings suggested that complex
gangliosides are required in neuronal functions, such as synaptic
transmission, but not in the morphogenesis and organogenesis of the
brain. Higher levels of GM3 and GD3 expressed in the brains of these
mutant mice may have been able to compensate for the lack of complex
gangliosides.

Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC; 257220) is a progressive
neurodegenerative disorder caused by mutations in the NPC1 gene (607623)
and characterized by intracellular accumulation of cholesterol and
sphingolipids. To determine the relative contribution of ganglioside
accumulation in the neuropathogenesis of Niemann-Pick C disease, Liu et
al. (2000) bred NPC model mice with mice carrying a targeted mutation in
GalNAcT. Unlike the NPC model mice, the double mutant mice did not
exhibit central nervous system accumulation of gangliosides GM2 or of
glycolipids GA1 and GA2. Histologic analysis revealed that the
characteristic neuronal storage pathology of NPC disease was
substantially reduced in the double mutant mice. By contrast, visceral
pathology was similar in the NPC and double mutant mice. Most notably,
the clinical phenotype of the double mutant mice, in the absence of CNS
ganglioside accumulation and associated neuronal pathology, did not
improve. The authors concluded that complex ganglioside storage, while
responsible for much of the neuronal pathology, did not significantly
influence the clinical phenotype of the NPC model.

609317	TITLE *609317 TRIPARTITE MOTIF-CONTAINING PROTEIN 36; TRIM36
;;RBCC728
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a B-box domain consensus sequence to screen EST databases for
novel TRIM family members, Reymond et al. (2001) identified and cloned
mouse and human TRIM36. The deduced protein contains an N-terminal RING
domain, B-box-1 and B-box-2 domains, and a coiled-coil region.

By sequencing a region of chromosome 5 duplicated in a renal cell
carcinoma, Balint et al. (2004) identified TRIM36, which they designated
RBCC728. They obtained the full-length cDNA by PCR of fetal brain and
adult kidney cDNA libraries. The deduced 728-amino acid protein has an
N-terminal RING finger C3HC4 structure, 2 B-boxes, a coiled-coil region,
a fibronectin type III (see 135600) domain and a C-terminal domain found
in SPRY proteins (see SPRY1; 602465). TRIM36 also contains a bipartite
nuclear localization signal. TRIM36 shares 26% amino acid identity with
MID1 (300552). Quantitative RT-PCR detected highest TRIM36 expression in
testis, followed by prostate and brain, with weak expression in kidney,
lung, and heart. TRIM36 expression was upregulated in some prostate
cancers compared with normal tissue. Immunohistochemical analysis of
recombinant and endogenous TRIM36 in COS-7 cells showed the protein
expressed in a slightly filamentous staining pattern in the cytoplasm.
TRIM36 often accumulated near sites of cell-cell contact, and mitotic
cells were negative for TRIM36 staining.

GENE STRUCTURE

Balint et al. (2004) determined that the TRIM36 gene contains 10 exons
and spans 55 kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Reymond et al. (2001) mapped the TRIM36
gene to chromosome 5q22. By shotgun sequencing, Balint et al. (2004)
identified the TRIM36 gene within a BAC mapped to chromosome 5q22.3.

606157	TITLE *606157 PANTOTHENATE KINASE 2; PANK2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Pantothenate kinase (EC 2.7.2.33) is an essential regulatory enzyme in
CoA biosynthesis, catalyzing the cytosolic phosphorylation of
pantothenate (vitamin B5), N-pantothenoylcysteine, and pantetheine. CoA
is the major acyl carrier, playing a central role in intermediary and
fatty acid metabolism. In both yeast and fly, each with only 1
pantothenate kinase gene, the null mutant is inviable (summary by Zhou
et al., 2001).

CLONING

Using linkage analysis of an extended Amish pedigree, Taylor et al.
(1996) defined an interval on 20p13 that contains the gene mutant in
Hallervorden-Spatz disease, now known as neurodegeneration with brain
iron accumulation-1 (NBIA1; 234200). Zhou et al. (2001) narrowed the
critical region for the disorder by genotyping polymorphic
microsatellite markers in affected families. Analysis of candidate genes
in this 1.4-Mb region led to the identification in the index family of a
7-bp deletion in the coding sequence of a gene with homology to murine
pantothenate kinase-1. PANK2 is a member of a family of eukaryotic genes
consisting of a group of 6 exons that encode homologous core proteins,
preceded by a series of alternate initiating exons, some of which encode
unique N-terminal peptides. By 5-prime RACE and EST analysis, Zhou et
al. (2001) found evidence for at least 5 initiating exons for PANK2, but
only 1 of these, exon 1C, has an open reading frame with potential
initiation codons that splices in-frame to exon 2. Zhou et al. (2001)
found a sequence similar to that of human PANK2 in mouse, with homology
in the derived amino acid sequence extending to the leucine codon at
nucleotide 31 but diverging 5-prime of it. There is precedence for the
use of a leucine initiating codon in humans, which is probably read by a
methionine tRNA. The leucine codon is flanked by a reasonable initiation
consensus sequence. Zhou et al. (2001) also noted the presence of a
stem-loop structure 14 nucleotides downstream from this leucine, the
location of which has been shown to enhance translation initiation at
nonconserved AUG and non-AUG initiation codons. The mouse stem-loop
sequence is nearly identical, with only 3 nucleotide changes, 2 in the
postulated loop of the stem loop and 1 that changes a GC to a GU
basepair, which implies structural conservation. Because of this strong
conservation, Zhou et al. (2001) proposed that the CUG may serve as an
alternative initiation codon for translation in addition to one of the
methionine codons downstream. There is also a 22-bp palindrome at the
junction of spliced exons 1C and 2. This sequence may form a hairpin
structure and thus explain why most PANK2 ESTs terminate just 3-prime of
the palindrome. Zhou et al. (2001) speculated that this sequence may
serve a regulatory function. PANK2 is ubiquitously expressed, including
in retina and infant basal ganglia. Zhou et al. (2001) provided evidence
for pantothenic kinase activity in PANK2 by showing that the human gene
PANK2 can rescue the temperature-sensitive E. coli pantothenate kinase
mutant.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hortnagel et al. (2003) determined the exon-intron structure of the
human PANK2 gene and identified 2 alternatively used first exons. The
resulting transcripts encode distinct isoforms of PANK2, one of which
carries an N-terminal extension with a predicted mitochondrial targeting
signal. An in vitro import assay and in vivo immunolocalization
experiments demonstrated a mitochondrial localization of this isoform.
The authors concluded that the symptoms observed in pantothenate
kinase-associated neurodegeneration (234200) may be caused by a
deficiency of the mitochondrial isoform; they further postulated the
existence of a complete intramitochondrial pathway for de novo synthesis
of coenzyme A.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Zhou et al. (2001) identified 3 nonsense mutations in exon 1C of the
PANK2 gene in affected individuals with classic Hallervorden-Spatz
disease (234200), also known as neurodegeneration with brain iron
accumulation-1 (NBIA1) or pantothenate kinase-associated
neurodegeneration (PKAN), but not in controls.

In the original patient with HARP syndrome (607236) reported by Higgins
et al. (1992), Ching et al. (2002) identified homozygosity for a
mutation in the PANK2 gene (606157.0011). HARP syndrome shares many
clinical and radiographic features with PKAN, but is distinguished by a
specific lipoprotein abnormality. The mutation identified by Ching et
al. (2002) confirmed that HARP syndrome is part of the PKAN disease
spectrum.

Hayflick et al. (2003) performed clinical assessment and mutation screen
of the PANK2 gene on 123 patients from 98 families with a diagnosis of
Hallervorden-Spatz syndrome, classified on the basis of clinical
assessment as having classic disease (characterized by early onset with
rapid progression) or atypical disease (later onset with slow
progression). PANK2 mutations were found in 66 of the 98 families. Of 49
families whose members had classic disease, all had mutations in PANK2.
Of 49 families whose members had atypical disease, mutations were found
in 17 (35%). Whereas almost all mutations in patients with atypical
disease led to amino acid changes, those in patients with classic
disease more often resulted in predicted protein truncation. Patients
with atypical disease who had PANK2 mutations were more likely to have
prominent speech-related and psychiatric symptoms than patients with
classic disease or mutation-negative patients with atypical disease. In
all patients with pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration,
whether classic or atypical, T2-weighted MRI of the brain showed a
specific pattern of hyperintensity within the hypointense medial globus
pallidus. This pattern was not seen in any patients without mutations.
Predicted levels of pantothenate kinase-2 protein correlated with the
severity of the disease.

In the 66 families with mutations in the PANK2 gene studied by Hayflick
et al. (2003), 2 PANK2 mutations, both of them missense mutations,
accounted for one-third of the disease alleles, G411R (606157.0002) and
T418M (606157.0010). G411R constituted 31 disease-related alleles in 27
families. Eighty-one percent of the 27 families with the G411R mutation
were of European descent. In 6 families (4 with classic disease and 2
with atypical disease), the G411R mutation was found on one chromosome
and no mutation was identified on the other. Families with only 1
identified mutation were not distinguishable from those with 2. Some of
these mutations were undetectable with the screening method used, e.g.,
promoter mutations. Six of the 9 families with a single mutant allele
had only the allele with the G411R mutation. This observation is
striking because mutations in both alleles were detected in nearly all
families, and it suggests that G411R may be semidominant, with 1 allele
sufficient to cause disease given certain genetic backgrounds. Against
this hypothesis was the fact that no disease phenotype was observed in
G411R-heterozygous carrier parents of affected persons.

In 16 patients with PKAN, Pellecchia et al. (2005) identified 12
mutations in the PANK2 gene, including 5 novel mutations. They found no
genotype/phenotype correlations.

Hartig et al. (2006) identified homozygous or compound heterozygous
PANK2 mutations in 48 of 72 patients with PKAN. Deletions accounted for
4% of mutated alleles. There was a correlation between predicted
loss-of-function alleles and earlier age at disease onset.

ANIMAL MODEL

Kuo et al. (2005) generated a mouse knockout of the murine Pank2 gene.
Homozygous null mice gradually developed retinal degeneration with
progressive photoreceptor decline, significantly lower scotopic a- and
b-wave amplitudes, decreased cell number and disruption of the outer
segment, and reduced pupillary constriction response. Homozygous male
mutants were infertile due to azoospermia, a condition that was not
appreciated in affected humans with pantothenate kinase-associated
neurodegeneration (234200). In contrast to the human, homozygous null
mice exhibited no basal ganglia changes or dystonia. By
immunohistochemistry, Pank2 was localized to mitochondria in both retina
and spermatozoa.

Drosophila has only 1 PANK gene, fumble (fbl), which encodes several
isoforms of pantothenate kinase, including a long isoform fblL that
localizes to mitochondria and shorter isoforms fblS1 and fblS2 that
localize to the cytosol. Wu et al. (2009) introduced various isoforms of
Drosophila fbl and human PANK2 into flies to study their in vivo
functions. Only mitochondria-targeted FblL or human PANK2 was able to
rescue a hypomorphic fbl(1) mutation, with the rescuing ability
dependent on the expression level of the transgene. Transgenic lines
with low expression of normal fbl or PANK2 displayed similar phenotypes
as PANK2-mutant transgenic flies. These PANK2 mutants all showed reduced
enzyme activity, and phenotype severity correlated with in vitro enzyme
activity. Cytosolic PANK3 (606161) and PANK4 (606162) could partially
rescue all fbl defects except male sterility. The authors concluded that
fbl is the ortholog of human PANK2, and PANK2 is functionally more
potent than PANK3 and PANK4 in vivo. Wu et al. (2009) suggested that
mitochondria-located pantothenate kinase is required to achieve the
maximal enzymatic activity to fulfill the most challenging biologic
tasks such as maintaining male fertility and optimal neuronal function,
and PKAN features are mainly due to the reduction of the total cellular
pantothenate kinase activity in the most susceptible regions.

In individuals with both typical and atypical pantothenate
kinase-associated neurodegeneration (234200), Zhou et al. (2001)
identified a C-to-T transition at nucleotide 1283 of the PANK2 gene,
resulting in a threonine-to-methionine substitution at codon 418
(T418M). This mutation was found in homozygosity in 2 patients with
classical PKAN, and in compound heterozygosity with the G411R mutation
(606157.0002) in an individual with atypical PKAN.

Hayflick et al. (2003) found the T418M mutation on 10 alleles in 6 of 66
families with PANK2 mutations causing Hallervorden-Spatz syndrome.

.0011
HARP SYNDROME
PANK2, ARG371TER

In the patient originally reported by Higgins et al. (1992) with HARP
syndrome (607236), Ching et al. (2002) demonstrated homozygosity for a
C-to-T transition at nucleotide 1111 in exon 5 of the PANK2 gene. The
mutation changed an arginine codon to a stop codon at amino acid 371 and
shortened PANK2 by 89 amino acids. Ching et al. (2002) suspected that
the patient was the offspring of consanguineous parents because they
came from a village of 500 inhabitants. The patient demonstrated severe
spasticity and dystonia from early childhood. At age 10, she was shown
to have pigmentary retinopathy on funduscopic examination and the 'eye
of the tiger' sign on brain MRI. Peripheral blood smear and electron
microscopy demonstrated marked acanthocytosis that was not due to an
intrinsic erythrocyte protein defect. On high-resolution lipoprotein
electrophoresis, she demonstrated absence of the pre-beta fraction and
normal blood levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, high and low density
lipoprotein cholesterol, and apolipoproteins A, B, and E.

.0012
HARP SYNDROME
PANK2, MET327THR

In a patient with HARP syndrome (607236) initially reported by Orrell et
al. (1995), Houlden et al. (2003) identified compound heterozygosity for
mutations in the PANK2 gene: a 980T-C change in exon 4, resulting in a
met327-to-thr (M327T) substitution, and a splice site mutation
(606157.0013). Her unaffected father and 2 of his unaffected brothers
were heterozygous for the M327T mutation.

.0013
HARP SYNDROME
NEURODEGENERATION WITH BRAIN IRON ACCUMULATION 1, INCLUDED
PANK2, IVS4, G-T, -1

In a patient with HARP syndrome (607236) initially reported by Orrell et
al. (1995), Houlden et al. (2003) identified compound heterozygosity for
mutations in the PANK2 gene: a G-to-T transversion at the splice site of
exon 5 (IVS4-1G-T), and M327T (606157.0012). The patient's mother and
sister, both of whom had acanthocytosis and hypoprebetalipoproteinemia
without neurologic abnormalities, were heterozygous for the splice site
mutation. Houlden et al. (2003) noted that the IVS4 mutation had been
reported in 2 patients with classic pantothenate kinase-associated
neurodegeneration (234200) (Hayflick et al., 2003), thus confirming that
the 2 disorders are allelic.

.0014
NEURODEGENERATION WITH BRAIN IRON ACCUMULATION 1
PANK2, 3-BP DEL, 1142GAG

In affected members from 4 Dutch families with pantothenate
kinase-associated neurodegeneration (234200), Rump et al. (2005)
identified a 3-bp deletion (1142delGAG) in the PANK2 gene. The in-frame
deletion is predicted to result in substitution of arg371 and glu372
with a glutamine in the catalytic domain of the protein. Five patients
from 3 families were homozygous for the mutation. The patient from the
fourth family was compound heterozygous for the deletion and a second
mutation (S68X; 606157.0015). Haplotype analysis suggested a founder
effect that arose in Friesland, a northern province of the Netherlands,
at the beginning of the ninth century, approximately 38 generations ago.

.0015
NEURODEGENERATION WITH BRAIN IRON ACCUMULATION 1
PANK2, SER68TER

In a Dutch patient with pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration
(234200), Rump et al. (2005) identified compound heterozygosity for 2
mutations in the PANK2 gene: a 3-bp deletion (606157.0014) and a 233C-A
transversion, resulting in a ser68-to-ter (S68X) substitution. The
patient had a severe form of the disorder and died at age 12 years.

610670	TITLE *610670 CYTOCHROME P450, FAMILY 2, SUBFAMILY U, POLYPEPTIDE 1; CYP2U1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Members of the P450 enzyme family have roles in the tissue-specific
conversion of substrates into locally active hormones, vitamins, and
signaling molecules, including arachidonic acid derivatives known as
eicosanoids. By EST database searching with the consensus sequence of
the P450 heme-binding domain, followed by screening of a human thymus
cDNA library, Chuang et al. (2004) identified CYP2U1. The deduced
544-amino acid protein shares many of the hallmark features of members
of the cytochrome P450 family, including a heme binding domain, PERF
domain, and ETLR domain. The protein is highly conserved among species
and shares 36% and 37.1% sequence identity with CYP2J2 (601258), an
arachidonic acid (AA) epoxygenase, and CYP2R1 (608713), a microsomal
vitamin D-25 hydrolase, respectively. Real-time PCR showed that CYP2U1
mRNA was expressed at highest levels in thymus and cerebellum, and at
low levels in several other tissues tested.

GENE FUNCTION

Using recombination experiments in Sf9 insect cells, Chuang et al.
(2004) found that CYP2U1 metabolized arachidonic acid, docosahexaenoic
acid (DHA), and other long chain fatty acids. Chuang et al. (2004)
suggested that CYP2U1 may play a role in brain and immune functions.

GENE STRUCTURE

Chuang et al. (2004) determined that the CYP2U1 gene has 5 exons, in
contrast to most CYP2 family members, which have 9 exons.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the CYP2U1
gene to chromosome 4 (TMAP SHGC-59620). Chuang et al. (2004) stated that
CYP2U1 maps to 4q25.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of 2 consanguineous Saudi Arabian families with
autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia (SPG56; 615030), Tesson et al.
(2012) identified a homozygous mutation in the CYP2U1 gene (D316V;
610670.0001). The mutation was found by linkage analysis followed by
exome sequencing of the candidate region. Sequencing of this gene in 94
additional SPG patients identified biallelic mutations in 3 families
(610670.0002-610670.0005). All patients had onset in the first decade of
spastic paraplegia, often involving the upper limbs, and of variable
severity. Three patients had cognitive impairment and 5 had a
subclinical axonal neuropathy. In the same study, Tesson et al. (2012)
identified pathogenic mutations in the DDHD1 gene (614603) as a cause of
SPG28 (609340). Both the DDHD1 and CYP2U1 gene products were expressed
concomitantly in the developing mouse brain, and both showed partial
mitochondrial localization. Mutant cells from SPG28 and SPG56 patients
showed significantly lower mitochondrial respiration activity, lower ATP
levels, and increased cytosolic hydrogen peroxide compared to controls.
However, isolated catalytic activities of each of the respiratory chain
complexes, measured after disruption of the mitochondrial membrane, were
similar to controls. SPG56 fibroblasts showed structural abnormalities,
suggesting a defect in mitochondrial membrane organization. CYP2U1 can
catalyze the hydroxylation of arachidonic acid and related long-chain
fatty acids, which are mediators of signaling pathways and may affect
signaling of hormones or neurotransmitters. In addition, accumulation of
reactive oxygen species may contribute to neurodegeneration. The study
indicated that both DDHD1 and CYP2U1 are involved in the same pathway
related to lipid metabolism and disruption of mitochondrial function,
suggesting a common disease pathway in SPG.

613934	TITLE *613934 TRANSMEMBRANE PROTEIN 25; TMEM25
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing uncharacterized ESTs, Katoh and Katoh (2004) identified 2
splice variants of TMEM25. The full-length transcript encodes a deduced
366-amino acid protein with an N-terminal signal peptide, followed by a
C2-type immunoglobulin domain, a transmembrane domain, and a C-terminal
domain. A splice variant lacking exon 5 encodes a deduced 322-amino acid
protein that lacks the transmembrane domain and is predicted to be
secreted. EST database analysis revealed TMEM25 expression in brain,
including cerebellar cortex and hippocampus, as well as in
neuroblastoma, brain tumors, and gastric cancer, and suggested that
full-length TMEM25 is the major transcript. Full-length mouse Tmem25
shares 91.0% amino acid identity with full-length human TMEM25.

GENE STRUCTURE

Katoh and Katoh (2004) determined that the TMEM25 gene contains 9 exons
and spans about 4.6 kb. Exon 5 is alternatively spliced.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Katoh and Katoh (2004) mapped the TMEM25
gene to chromosome 11q23.3. The mouse Tmem25 gene maps to chromosome 9B.

609076	TITLE *609076 F-BOX AND LEUCINE-RICH REPEAT PROTEIN 6; FBXL6
;;FBL6;;
FBL6A
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the F-box protein family, such as FBXL6, are characterized by
an approximately 40-amino acid F-box motif. SCF complexes, formed by
SKP1 (601434), cullin (see CUL1; 603134) and F-box proteins, act as
protein-ubiquitin ligases. F-box proteins interact with SKP1 through the
F box, and they interact with ubiquitination targets through other
protein interaction domains (Jin et al., 2004).

CLONING

Using SKP1 as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen and by searching DNA
databases, Cenciarelli et al. (1999) identified a partial FBXL6 cDNA,
which they designated FBL6A.

Winston et al. (1999) cloned a partial mouse Fbl6 cDNA. The deduced
mouse protein contains 12 tandem leucine-rich repeats (LRRs).

Jin et al. (2004) reported that the human FBXL6 protein contains an
N-terminal F box, followed by 12 LRRs.

MAPPING

Jin et al. (2004) stated that the FBXL6 gene maps to chromosome 8q24.3
and the mouse Fbxl6 gene maps to chromosome 15.

614730	TITLE *614730 PHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL GLYCAN, CLASS O; PIGO
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Many proteins are anchored to cell surface membranes via a
glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) modification. PIGO is involved GPI
biosynthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and has a role in the
transfer of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) to the third mannose (Man3) of
the GPI core (Hong et al., 2000).

CLONING

Hong et al. (2000) cloned mouse Pigo from a testis cDNA library, and
they identified human PIGO by database analysis. The deduced 1,101-amino
acid mouse protein has a transmembrane domain near the N terminus,
followed by a hydrophilic region of about 400 amino acids and 15
transmembrane domains in the C-terminal half. The hydrophilic region
contains motifs conserved in various phosphodiesterases and nucleotide
pyrophosphatases. Pigo also has 2 potential N-glycosylation sites.
Western blot analysis of transfected and fractionated CHO cells revealed
that Pigo associated with ER membrane markers.

GENE FUNCTION

Hong et al. (2000) found that knockout of Pigo in F9 mouse embryonal
carcinoma cells reduced, but did not eliminate, surface expression of
Thy1 (188230), a protein that requires a GPI anchor for membrane
association. In contrast, knockout of Pigf (600153) completely
eliminated surface expression of Thy1. Knockout of either Pigo or Pigf
resulted in accumulation of the same major GPI intermediate lacking PE
on Man3, but different minor GPI intermediates. Protein pull-down assays
revealed that Pigo and Pigf interacted; however, much of Pigf did not
associate with Pigo. Expression of Pigo was much higher in the presence
than in the absence of Pigf, whereas Pigf was stable in the absence of
Pigo. Hong et al. (2000) concluded that PIGO is involved in, but not
essential for, GPI anchoring of proteins, whereas PIGF is essential for
it. They hypothesized that PIGF may have other partners for transferring
PE onto Man3, possibly resulting in a minor change in GPI structure.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hong et al. (2000) determined that the PIGO gene contains 10 exons.

MAPPING

Hong et al. (2000) reported that the PIGO gene maps to chromosome 9p13.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

By exome sequencing of 2 sisters with hyperphosphatasia with mental
retardation syndrome-2 (HPMRS2; 614749), Krawitz et al. (2012)
identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the PIGO gene
(614730.0001 and 614730.0002). Sequencing of this gene in 11 additional
patients with a similar disorder identified 1 patient who was compound
heterozygous for 2 mutations (614730.0001 and 614730.0003). In vitro
functional expression studies showed that the mutant proteins either
lacked or had decreased functional activity. PIGO-deficient CHO cell
lines had decreased cell surface placental alkaline phosphatase (ALP)
activity with increased secretion of ALP, which was rescued by
transfection with wildtype PIGO. The findings indicated that
hyperphosphatasia in the patients with PIGO mutations is a result of
release of ALP into the serum due to a defect in GPI anchoring of ALP to
the cell membrane.

HYPERPHOSPHATASIA WITH MENTAL RETARDATION SYNDROME 2
PIGO, LEU957PHE

In 2 sisters, born of unrelated British parents, with hyperphosphatasia
with mental retardation syndrome-2 (HPMRS2; 614749), Krawitz et al.
(2012) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the PIGO
gene: a 2869C-T transition resulting in a leu957-to-phe (L957F)
substitution, and a 1-bp duplication (2361dupC; 614730.0002), resulting
in a frameshift and premature termination (Thr788HisfsTer5). The
mutations were detected by whole-exome sequencing and confirmed by
Sanger sequencing. The L957F substitution occurs in a highly conserved
residue in the transmembrane domain. Each unaffected parent was
heterozygous for 1 of the mutations. Sequencing of the PIGO gene in 11
additional patients with a similar phenotype identified compound
heterozygous mutations in 1 patient: L957F and a G-to-A transition in
intron 8 (3069+5G-A; 614730.0003), resulting in the skipping of exon 9.
The splice site mutation was found in 1 of 5,379 controls. In vitro
functional expression studies demonstrated that the 2361dupC mutation
did not result in restoration of CD59 (107271) expression at the cell
surface of PIGO-deficient CHO cells, and that L957F induced only low
levels of CD59 expression in these cells. The mutant truncated protein
was expressed at high levels compared to wildtype, whereas the L957F
protein was expressed at decreased levels. PIGO-deficient CHO cell lines
had decreased cell surface placental alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity
with increased secretion of ALP, which was rescued by transfection with
wildtype PIGO. The findings indicated that hyperphosphatasia in the
patients with PIGO mutations is a result of release of ALP into the
serum due to a defect in glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchoring of
ALP to the cell membrane.
