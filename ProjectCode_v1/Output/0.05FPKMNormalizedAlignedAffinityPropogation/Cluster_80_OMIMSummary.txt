C112
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

N-acetylneuraminate pyruvate lyase (EC 4.1.3.3) controls the cellular
concentration of sialic acid by catalyzing the conversion of sialic acid
into acylmannosamines and pyruvate (Wu et al., 2005).

CLONING

By searching for genes in a region of chromosome 1 associated with
hereditary prostate cancer (HPC1; 601518), followed by screening cDNA
libraries, Sood et al. (2001) cloned NPL, which they called C112. The
deduced protein contains 320 amino acids. Northern blot analysis
detected weak expression of a 5-kb transcript in all human tissues
examined.

By large-scale sequence analysis of clones obtained from a fetal brain
cDNA library, Wu et al. (2005) cloned a splice variant of NPL. The
deduced 301-amino acid splice variant, which they called NPLV2, contains
an N-terminal dihydrodipicolinate synthase (DHDPS) domain and 5 putative
N-terminal phosphorylation sites. RT-PCR detected highest expression in
liver, kidney, and peripheral blood leukocytes, and lower expression in
placenta, pancreas, spleen, thymus, ovary, and small intestine. By
database analysis, Wu et al. (2005) identified 3 other NPL splice
variants.

GENE STRUCTURE

Wu et al. (2005) determined that the NPL gene contains 11 exons and
spans over 40 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Sood et al. (2001) mapped the NPL gene to
chromosome 1q25.
