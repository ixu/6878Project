;;MITOCHONDRIAL TRANSCRIPTION TERMINATION FACTOR 4; MTERF4
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MTERFD2 forms a stoichiometric complex with the 5-methylcytosine RNA
methyltransferase NSUN4 (615394). By binding to both ribosomal RNA and
NSUN4, MTERFD2 recruits NSUN4 to the large ribosomal subunit, an
essential step in ribosomal biogenesis (Spahr et al., 2012).

CLONING

By RT-PCR of HeLa cell total RNA, Yu et al. (2011) cloned MTERFD2, which
they called MTERF4. The deduced 381-amino acid protein has a predicted
mitochondrial localization signal, multiple leucine zipper motifs, 2
basic DNA-binding domains, and a C terminus with many acidic amino acids
not found in other MTERF proteins. Fluorescence-tagged MTERF4 localized
to mitochondria in transfected HeLa cells.

Using Northern blot analysis, Camara et al. (2011) detected variable
Mterf4 expression in all mouse tissues examined. Fluorescence-tagged
mouse or human MTERF4 colocalized with mitochondrial markers following
transfection of HeLa cells. Sequence analysis revealed that MTERF4 was
processed into mature proteins beginning with either leu43 or asn48
following targeting to mitochondria.

MAPPING

Hartz (2013) mapped the MTERFD2 gene to chromosome 2q37.3 based on an
alignment of the MTERFD2 sequence (Genbank GENBANK AF161359) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

GENE FUNCTION

Using small interfering RNA, Yu et al. (2011) found that knockdown of
MTERF4 in HeLa cells suppressed cell growth and induced accumulation of
cells in sub-G1. Downregulation of MTERF4 also significantly induced
necrosis, but not apoptosis.

By immunoprecipitation analysis and size-exclusion chromatography,
Camara et al. (2011) showed that the mature mitochondrial forms of NSUN4
and MTERF4 (beginning with asn48) interacted in HeLa cells to form a
dimer with an apparent molecular mass of 112 kD . The epitope-tagged
MTERF4-NSUN4 complex comigrated with the large (39S) mitochondrial
ribosomal subunit following transfection in HeLa cells. Knockdown of
MTERF4 via RNA interference reduced targeting of NSUN4 to the 39S
subunit. RNA immunoprecipitation showed that epitope-tagged MTERF4
cross-linked with several ribosomal RNA species, including 16S, 12S, and
7S RNA. Camara et al. (2011) concluded that MTERF4 targets NSUN4 to
ribosomal RNA through to its ability to bind both NSUN4 and ribosomal
RNA.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Spahr et al. (2012) described the structure of the NSUN4-MTERF4
heterodimeric complex at 2.9-angstrom resolution. They found that MTERF4
is an all alpha-helical protein that adopts a half-doughnut shape with a
right-handed superhelical twist. MTERF4 bound NSUN4 through conserved
polar and hydrophobic interactions. A positively-charged RNA-binding
path extended along the concave and convex sides of MTERF4 and into the
active site of NSUN4 near the the binding site for the methyl donor
S-adenosyl-L-methionine.

ANIMAL MODEL

Camara et al. (2011) found that knockout of Mterf4 in mice was embryonic
lethal. At embryonic day 8.5, Mterf4 -/- embryos were smaller than
wildtype and lacked a heart and optic discs. Targeted knockout of Mterf4
in cardiac tissue caused gradual accumulation of myocardial mitochondria
with abnormal morphology from 5 weeks of age, and reduced life span to
21 weeks of age. Analysis of steady-state levels of respiratory chain
complexes in Mterf4 -/- hearts revealed reduced assembly of
mitochondrial encoded subunits (complex I, III, IV, and V) compared with
exclusively nuclear-encoded complex II, accompanied by reduced
respiratory chain activities. Mterf4 -/- hearts also showed massively
increased transcription of mitochondrial DNA coupled with impaired
translation, as well as dramatically increased levels of the 28S and 39S
mitochondrial ribosomes without a corresponding increase in the
assembled 55S ribosome.
