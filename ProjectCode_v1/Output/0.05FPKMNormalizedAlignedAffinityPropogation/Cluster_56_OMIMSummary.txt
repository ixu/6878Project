611973	TITLE *611973 MITOCHONDRIAL RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN S6; MRPS6
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Mitochondria have their own translation system for production of 13
proteins essential for oxidative phosphorylation. MRPS6 is 1 of more
than 70 protein components of mitochondrial ribosomes that are encoded
by the nuclear genome (Kenmochi et al., 2001).

CLONING

By proteolytic digestion of whole bovine 28S subunits, followed by
peptide analysis and EST database analysis, Koc et al. (2001) identified
full-length human MRPS6. The deduced 125-amino acid MRPS6 protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 14.2 kD. Koc et al. (2001) identified MRPS6
orthologs in mouse, Drosophila, C. elegans, yeast, and E. coli. Highest
conservation is in the N-terminal end and central region of MRPS6
orthologs. Mouse and human MRPS6 share 84.8% amino acid identity.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis and analysis of an integrated BAC-STS map,
Kenmochi et al. (2001) mapped the MRPS6 gene to chromosome
21q21.3-q22.1.

602677	TITLE *602677 RING FINGER PROTEIN 5; RNF5
;;RING5;;
RMA1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The RING finger is a unique zinc-chelating domain involved in mediating
protein-protein interactions. The extensive sequence homology within the
RING finger domain permitted Kyushiki et al. (1997) to clone RNF5, a
novel member of the RING finger family of genes. RNF5 encodes a
predicted 1,620-amino acid protein that shares significant homology with
a hypothetical protein encoded by Caenorhabditis elegans. Expression of
RNF5 was detected as a 1.2-kb transcript in a variety of human tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

Cystic fibrosis (219700) arises from misfolding and premature
degradation of CFTR (602421) containing a deletion of phe508 (delF508;
602421.0001). Younger et al. (2006) identified an endoplasmic reticulum
(ER) membrane-associated ubiquitin ligase complex containing the E3
RMA1, the E2 UBC6E (UBE2J1), and derlin-1 (DERL1; 608813) that
cooperated with the cytosolic HSC70 (HSPA8; 600816)/CHIP (STUB1; 607207)
E3 complex to triage CFTR and delFl508. Derlin-1 retained CFTR in the ER
membrane and interacted with RMA1 and UBC6E to promote proteasomal
degradation of CFTR. RMA1 could recognize folding defects in delF508
coincident with translation, whereas CHIP appeared to act
posttranslationally. A folding defect in delF508 detected by RMA1
involved the inability of the second membrane-spanning domain of CFTR to
productively interact with N-terminal domains. Younger et al. (2006)
concluded that the RMA1 and CHIP E3 ubiquitin ligases act sequentially
in ER membrane and cytosol to monitor the folding status of CFTR and
delF508.

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen, Zhong et al. (2009) identified RNF5 as an
MITA (TMEM173; 612374)-interacting protein. Coimmunoprecipitation and
mutation analyses showed that the RNF5 C terminus was required for the
interaction, which was induced by viral infection. RNF5 ubiquitinated
MITA at lys150, leading to MITA degradation and inhibition of
virus-induced IRF3 (603734) activation, IFNB1 (147640) expression, and
cellular antiviral response. Zhong et al. (2009) concluded that RNF5
negatively regulates virus-induced signaling by targeting MITA for
ubiquitination and degradation at the mitochondria.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kyushiki et al. (1997) determined that the RNF5 gene contains 6 exons.

MAPPING

Kyushiki et al. (1997) mapped the RNF5 gene to chromosome 6p21.31 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization. Radiation hybrid mapping likewise
assigned RNF5 to a region proximal to the major histocompatibility
complex (MHC) on chromosome 6p. RNF5 was the third RING finger gene
identified in the region proximal to MHC, raising the possibility that
this family of genes may exist as a cluster in that area of the genome.
The others are RING finger protein-1 (602045) and RING finger protein-3
(601540).

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Chemokines are a group of small (approximately 8 to 14 kD), mostly
basic, structurally related molecules that regulate cell trafficking of
various types of leukocytes through interactions with a subset of
7-transmembrane, G protein-coupled receptors. Chemokines also play
fundamental roles in the development, homeostasis, and function of the
immune system, and they have effects on cells of the central nervous
system as well as on endothelial cells involved in angiogenesis or
angiostasis. Chemokines are divided into 2 major subfamilies, CXC and
CC, based on the arrangement of the first 2 of the 4 conserved cysteine
residues; the 2 cysteines are separated by a single amino acid in CXC
chemokines and are adjacent in CC chemokines. CXC chemokines are further
subdivided into ELR and non-ELR types based on the presence or absence
of a glu-leu-arg sequence adjacent and N terminal to the CXC motif
(summary by Zlotnik and Yoshie, 2000).

CLONING

The GRO1 gene (CXCL1; 155730) was initially identified by Anisowicz et
al. (1987) by its constitutive overexpression in spontaneously
transformed Chinese hamster fibroblasts. (The name GRO stood for
growth-related.) Subsequently, a protein with melanoma
growth-stimulating activity (MGSA) was shown to be identical. Haskill et
al. (1990) reported the identification of 2 other GRO genes, which they
called GRO-beta and GRO-gamma (GRO3, CXCL3; 139111). These 2 share 90%
and 86% identity at the deduced amino acid level with the original
GRO-alpha isolate. One amino acid substitution, proline in GRO-alpha by
leucine in GRO-beta and GRO-gamma, leads to a large predicted change in
protein conformation. Significant differences were also found in the
3-prime untranslated region, including different numbers of ATTTA
repeats associated with mRNA instability. DNA hybridization with
oligonucleotide probes and partial sequence analysis of the genomic
clones confirmed that the 3 forms are derived from related but different
genes. Expression studies revealed tissue-specific regulation as well as
regulation by specific inducing agents, including interleukin-1, tumor
necrosis factor, and lipopolysaccharide.

Wolpe et al. (1989) showed that macrophages, in response to endotoxin,
secrete a protein with a molecular mass of about 6,000 daltons and with
an affinity for heparin. They termed this protein macrophage
inflammatory protein-2 (MIP2). It is a potent chemotactic agent for
polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Subcutaneous administration caused a
localized inflammatory reaction. Partial N-terminal sequence data showed
similarity to the family of proteins of which the archetype is platelet
factor-4 (PF4; 173460). The sequence of the MIP2 gene was found to be
most closely related to that of the GRO-beta gene.

Tekamp-Olson et al. (1990) used a cDNA clone of murine Mip2 to clone
cDNAs for 2 human homologs, MIP2-alpha and MIP2-beta, which are highly
homologous to each other and to the previously isolated gene for MGSA.
Thus, the 3 GRO genes represent the human homologs of the murine Mip2
gene.

GENE STRUCTURE

Haskill et al. (1990) reported the identification of 2 other GRO The
GROB gene consists of 4 exons, 3 introns, and a 3-prime untranslated
region of about 700 bp terminating at the polyadenylation site.

MAPPING

Studies by Haskill et al. (1990) indicated that the 3 GRO genes, GRO1,
GRO2, AND GRO3, map to chromosome 4q21.

By PCR analysis and mapping of YAC clones, O'Donovan et al. (1999)
localized a number of CXC chemokine genes to 4q12-q21. They proposed
that the order in this region is centromere--IL8--GRO1/PPBP
(121010)/PF4--SCYB5 (600324)/SCYB6 (138965)--GRO2/GRO3--SCYB11
(604852)--SCYB10 (147310)--MIG (601704)--telomere. The GRO2 gene was
localized to 4q12-q13.

ANIMAL MODEL

Nieuwenhuis et al. (2002) showed that clearance of intranasally applied
Pseudomonas aeruginosa is impaired in the lungs of CD1d
(188410)-deficient mice as well as in T cell-deficient mice. Failure to
clear the bacteria was associated with a markedly reduced influx of
neutrophils in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in the early stages of
the infection, which was thought to result from impaired production of
chemokines such as Mip2 by alveolar macrophages. Prior administration of
alpha-galactosylceramide to wildtype mice induced almost complete
eradication of P. aeruginosa from their lungs, indicating that
activation of CD1d-restricted T cells by alpha-galactosylceramide is
critical in host defense against these bacteria. Sequential radiologic,
macroscopic pathology, and histopathologic analyses confirmed early
enhanced inflammation and resolution of inflammation and bacterial
phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages in the
alpha-galactosylceramide-treated mice, whereas control mice exhibited
higher numbers of bacteria, lung hemorrhage, and swelling. Flow
cytometric analysis demonstrated that the macrophage activation in
alpha-galactosylceramide-treated mice was associated with increased
numbers of Ifng (147570)-producing NKT cells. Nieuwenhuis et al. (2002)
concluded that activation of CD1d-restricted T cells is crucial in
regulating the antimicrobial immune functions of macrophages at the lung
mucosal surface and suggested that this activity may help in preventing
colonization in diseases such as cystic fibrosis (219700) and in
patients undergoing chemotherapy.

In diseased mouse and human arteries, Zhao et al. (2004) demonstrated
that 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO; 152390)-positive macrophages localize to
areas of neoangiogenesis and that these cells constitute a main
component of aortic aneurysms induced by an atherogenic diet containing
cholate in Apoe (107741) -/- mice. 5-LO deficiency markedly attenuated
the formation of these aneurysms and was associated with reduced matrix
metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2; 120360) activity and diminished plasma
macrophage inflammatory protein-1-alpha (CCL3; 182283), but only
minimally affected the formation of lipid-rich lesions. The leukotriene
LTD4 strongly stimulated expression of CCL3 in macrophages and CXCL2 in
endothelial cells. Zhao et al. (2004) concluded that the 5-LO pathway is
linked to hyperlipidemia-dependent inflammation of the arterial wall and
to the pathogenesis of aortic aneurysms through a potential chemokine
intermediary route.

603646	TITLE *603646 CYTOCHROME c OXIDASE ASSEMBLY PROTEIN COX15; COX15
;;COX15, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Cytochrome c oxidase (COX; EC 1.9.3.1), the terminal component of the
mitochondrial respiratory chain, is a multiheteromeric enzyme embedded
in the mitochondrial inner membrane. COX consists of a protein backbone
bound to 2 copper-containing prosthetic groups, the cytochromes a and
a-3. See 123864. The S. cerevisiae cox15 protein is a constituent of the
inner mitochondrial membrane and may be involved in the assembly of the
COX protein backbone (Petruzzella et al., 1998).

CLONING

By searching an EST database for sequences related to cox15, Petruzzella
et al. (1998) identified cDNAs encoding human COX15. The cDNAs encoded 2
COX15 isoforms, COX15.1 and COX15.2, with different C termini. The amino
acid sequences of both isoforms are 42% identical to that of yeast
cox15. Sequence analysis indicated that COX15 contains a mitochondrial
leader peptide and 5 transmembrane domains. Using in vitro mitochondrial
import and trypsin-protection assays, the authors demonstrated that the
COX15 protein is targeted to mitochondria. Northern blot analysis
revealed that COX15 is expressed as 1.5-, 1.8-, and 3-kb mRNAs
predominantly in tissues characterized by high rates of oxidative
phosphorylation (OXPHOS), including muscle, heart, and brain.

MAPPING

Based on sequence similarity to ESTs, Petruzzella et al. (1998)
tentatively mapped the COX15 gene to 10q24.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Deficiencies in the activity of COX are a frequent cause of autosomal
recessive mitochondrial disease in infants (220110). These patients are
clinically and genetically heterogeneous. The defects identified in this
group have mostly involved genes coding for accessory proteins that play
important roles in the assembly of the COX holoenzyme complex. Antonicka
et al. (2003) used a panel of retroviral vectors expressing COX assembly
factors in these patients to identify the molecular basis of the COX
deficiency by functional complementation. They showed that
overexpression of COX15, a protein involved in the synthesis of heme A,
the heme prosthetic group for COX, could functionally complement the
isolated COX deficiency in fibroblasts from a patient with fatal
infantile who had predominantly cardiac involvement and relative sparing
of skeletal muscle (CEMCOX2; 615119).

Mutation analysis of COX15 in the patient identified an arg217-to-trp
(R217W; 603646.0001) mutation in 1 allele and a splice site mutation in
intron 3 on the other allele (C447-3G), resulting in deletion of exon 4
(603646.0002). In the patient, mitochondrial heme A content was reduced
in heart and fibroblast mitochondria, and levels of heme O were
increased in heart. COX activity and the total amount of fully assembled
enzyme were reduced by 50 to 70% in fibroblasts. Expression of COX15
increased heme A content and rescued COX activity. Thus, it appeared
that reduced availability of heme A stalls the assembly of COX. This
study established COX15 as an additional cause, along with SCO2, of
fatal infantile hypertrophic cardiomyopathy associated with isolated COX
deficiency.

Oquendo et al. (2004) reported a patient with Leigh syndrome (256000)
due to cytochrome c oxidase deficiency who was homozygous for the R217W
mutation in the COX15 gene.

Bugiani et al. (2005) reported a 16-year-old Italian boy with Leigh
syndrome who was compound heterozygous for a nonsense mutation (S151X;
603646.0003) and a missense mutation (S344P; 603646.0004) in the COX15
gene. The authors noted that defects in the COX15 gene appear to be
associated with considerable clinical and biochemical heterogeneity.

In an infant girl with isolated complex IV deficiency that was more
marked in cardiac than skeletal muscle, who died at day 9 of life with
encephalopathy, respiratory depression, and marked cardiac hypertrophy
of all walls, Alfadhel et al. (2011) analyzed 6 candidate genes and
identified compound heterozygosity for the R217W missense mutation and a
nonsense mutation (S151X; 603646.0003) in the COX15 gene.

In a female infant who had fatal infantile cytochrome c oxidase
deficiency with predominantly cardiac involvement and relative sparing
of skeletal muscle (CEMCOX2; 615119), originally reported by Kennaway et
al. (1990), Antonicka et al. (2003) identified compound heterozygosity
for a 700C-T transition on 1 allele, resulting in an arg217-to-trp
(R217W) substitution, and a splice site mutation in intron 3 on the
other allele (C447-3G), resulting in deletion of exon 4 (603646.0002).
The splicing error introduced a frameshift and a premature stop codon,
resulting in an unstable mRNA and, likely, a null allele.

In an infant girl with isolated complex IV deficiency that was more
marked in cardiac than skeletal muscle, who died at day 9 of life with
encephalopathy, respiratory depression, and marked cardiac hypertrophy,
Alfadhel et al. (2011) identified compound heterozygosity for the R217W
missense mutation and a nonsense mutation (S151X; 603646.0003) in the
COX15 gene.

In a patient with Leigh syndrome due to cytochrome c oxidase deficiency
(256000), Oquendo et al. (2004) identified homozygosity for the R217W
mutation. Both parents were heterozygous for the mutation. The authors
noted the phenotypic variation associated with this mutation.

In a 16-year-old Italian boy with Leigh syndrome (256000), Bugiani et
al. (2005) identified compound heterozygosity for a 452C-G transversion
in exon 4 of the COX15 gene, resulting in a ser151-to-ter (S151X)
substitution, and a 1030T-C transition in exon 8, resulting in a
ser344-to-pro (S344P; 603646.0004) substitution at a conserved residue
in the C-terminal end of the fifth predicted transmembrane domain. The
patient failed to thrive in infancy, with poor sucking and feeding
difficulties, and was noted to have severe psychomotor delay at 4 months
of age, with diffuse hypotonia and muscle wasting and weakness. MRI at
18 months of age showed symmetric signal changes in the posterior part
of the putamina and bilateral cerebellar white matter abnormalities.
Plasma lactate and pyruvate levels were markedly elevated. Symptoms
worsened thereafter with virtual arrest of body growth, progressive loss
of postural control, and onset of dystonic postures in the upper limbs,
whereas cognitive functions remained relatively better preserved.
Clinical features remained grossly unchanged thereafter, and apart from
central nervous system and skeletal muscle, the patient showed no
abnormality in other tissues or organs, including the heart,
gastrointestinal tract, liver, kidneys, or hematopoietic system.

604450	TITLE *604450 PROTEASOME 26S SUBUNIT, NON-ATPase, 12; PSMD12
;;p55
DESCRIPTION The 26S proteasome is responsible for the ATP-dependent degradation of a
variety of cellular proteins. Selective breakdown of these proteins is
mediated by the ubiquitin pathway. The 26S proteasome is a 2,000-kD
protein complex composed of the 20S proteasome, which is the catalytic
subcomplex, and PA700, which is the regulatory subcomplex. The
approximately 700-kD PA700 complex consists of approximately 20
heterogeneous proteins ranging from 25 to 112 kD. These subunits can be
divided into 2 classes, those that are members of the AAA (ATPases
associated with various cellular activities) family and those that are
not.

Saito et al. (1997) sequenced peptides from the p55 subunit of the
bovine PA700 complex. They identified a human EST encoding a homologous
protein and used this EST to isolate hepatoblastoma HepG2 cell cDNAs
encoding human p55, also called PSMD12. The deduced 456-amino acid
PSMD12 protein has a calculated molecular mass of 52,903 Da. The authors
identified a putative S. cerevisiae homolog, which they named NAS5, that
shares 41.1% amino acid sequence identity with PSMD12. Disruption of the
NAS5 gene resulted in lethality.

;;MIDGESTATION AND KIDNEY; MK;;
NEURITE GROWTH-PROMOTING FACTOR 2, FORMERLY; NEGF2, FORMERLY
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Midkine is a retinoic acid-responsive, heparin-binding growth factor
expressed in various cell types during embryogenesis. It promotes
angiogenesis, cell growth, and cell migration. Midkine is also expressed
in several carcinomas, suggesting that it may play a role in
tumorigenesis, perhaps through its effects on angiogenesis (summary by
Reynolds et al., 2004).

CLONING

Using mouse Mk to screen a midgestation human embryonic kidney cDNA
library, followed by screening a placenta genomic library, Tsutsui et
al. (1991) cloned human MDK, which they called MK. The deduced 121-amino
acid protein has a signal sequence and shares 87% identity with mouse
Mk. Orthologs of MK were detected in rat, cow, and chicken. The chicken
ortholog, Rihb, is a retinoic acid-induced heparin-binding protein. MK
shares about 50% amino acid homology with the human heparin-binding
protein pleiotrophin (PTN; 162095), with highest conservation in the
central part of the molecule and complete conservation of cysteine
residues. Northern blot analysis detected a transcript of about 1 kb in
adult human kidney and PA1 human teratocarcinoma cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Reynolds et al. (2004) found that hypoxia induced midkine expression in
alveolar epithelial cells and pulmonary vasculature in a strain of mice
sensitive to hypoxia. Hypoxia induced expression of both HIF1-alpha
(603348) and midkine in human placental adenocarcinoma, mouse fetal lung
mesenchyme, and human pulmonary adenocarcinoma cell lines. HIF1-alpha
induced midkine expression via regulatory elements in the mouse midkine
promoter. Chronic expression of midkine during embryonic development in
transgenic mice resulted in pulmonary arterial remodeling and
muscularization, but only during the postnatal phase of lung
development. In fetal mouse lung mesenchymal cells and transgenic mice,
midkine upregulated expression of myocardin (MYOCD; 606127), a regulator
of smooth muscle cell differentiation.

Intraperitoneal adhesions between organs or between organs and
peritoneal walls occur in more than 90% of cases involving major
abdominal operations. Using a model of postoperative adhesions and
Mk-null mice, Inoh et al. (2004) showed that midkine was fundamentally
involved in the formation of intraperitoneal adhesions, at least partly
by promoting migration of macrophages and neutrophils to the omentum.

Hobo et al. (2009) found that 5/6 nephrectomy in mice, a model of
chronic kidney disease, induced expression of midkine in lung, leading
to elevated angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE; 106180) activity and
plasma angiotensin II (106150) levels and subsequent hypertension.
Exposure to midkine enhanced ACE expression in primary cultured human
lung microvascular endothelial cells. Oxidative stress may have
contributed to midkine expression, since 5/6 nephrectomy induced
expression of NADH/NADPH oxidase-1 (NOX1; 300225), Nox2 (CYBB; 300481),
and Nox4 (605261). Furthermore, an antioxidant reduced midkine
expression and plasma angiotensin II levels and ameliorated hypertension
in 5/6 nephrectomized mice.

GENE STRUCTURE

Uehara et al. (1992) determined that the MDK gene contains 4 exons. The
5-prime flanking region adjacent to the start site contains 5 GC boxes,
a steroid/thyroid hormone receptor-binding site, and an A/T-rich island,
but there is no obvious CAAT box. Further upstream there is a region
with high GC content. The mouse Mdk gene has a similar organization,
with conservation of exons and significant homology in the 5-prime
region adjacent to the start site. There are 3 additional regions of
homology between mouse and human MDK in the 5-prime UTR.

MAPPING

By study of somatic cell hybrids, Eddy et al. (1991) demonstrated that
the MDK gene segregates concordantly with chromosome 11 and, using cell
hybrids carrying translocations involving chromosome 11, they mapped the
gene regionally to 11p13-p11. Kaname et al. (1993) mapped the MDK gene
to human chromosome 11p11.2 by fluorescence in situ hybridization.
Simon-Chazottes et al. (1992) mapped the mouse Mdk gene to chromosome 2,
using an interspecific backcross panel and microsatellite polymorphisms
as markers. O'Hara et al. (1995) used somatic cell hybrid analysis and
interspecific backcross analysis, respectively, to map human Mdk to
chromosome 11p13-p11 and mouse Mdk to a syntenic region of mouse
chromosome 2. They also mapped an Mdk pseudogene to mouse chromosome 11.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using microarray analysis, Ezquerra et al. (2005) found that aortae of
Mk -/- mice showed elevated expression of renin (REN; 179820),
angiotensinogen (106150), angiotensin II receptor-1 (AGTR1; 106165), and
angiotensin II receptor-2 (AGTR2; 300034) and decreased expression of
Ace.
