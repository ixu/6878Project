DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Nomura et al. (1998) identified a human gene, which they called PKDL,
that encodes a member of the polycystin protein family designated
polycystin-L. Polycystin-L has 50% amino acid sequence identity to
polycystin-2 (PKD2; 173910) and has striking sequence and structural
resemblance to the pore-forming alpha-1 subunits of calcium channels
(see 601011), suggesting that polycystin-L may function as a subunit of
an ion channel. The PKDL gene encodes a protein of 805 amino acids. The
full-length PKDL transcript is expressed at high levels in fetal
tissues, including kidney and liver, and is downregulated in adult
tissues. Nomura et al. (1998) found no evidence of linkage to PKDL in 6
autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease families that were unlinked
to PKD1 (601313) or PKD2 (613095).

Wu et al. (1998) independently identified PKD2L1, which they called
PKD2L. They found that PKD2L is expressed in adult heart and skeletal
muscle, brain, spleen, testis, and retina. They observed alternative
transcripts of 2.4, 2.7, and 3.0 kb. Wu et al. (1998) found that the
PKD2L protein showed 56% identity with polycystin-2 over a 581-amino
acid span; however, the C-terminal 65 residues of PKD2L are unrelated to
PKD2.

GENE STRUCTURE

Guo et al. (2000) determined the exon/intron structure of the PKDL gene.
PKDL contains 16 exons and undergoes alternative splicing. RT-PCR
analysis demonstrated the existence of at least 3 variants: PKDLdel5,
which lacks exon 5 and encodes a deduced protein with a 75-amino acid
in-frame deletion in its extracellular region; PKDLdel456, which lacks
parts of exons 4 and 6 and the whole of exon 5 and encodes a deduced
protein with a 120-amino acid in-frame deletion lacking the second and
third transmembrane domains; and PKDLdel15, which lacks exon 15 and
results in a frameshift and a premature stop codon, thereby truncating
the C-terminal domain of the deduced protein by 45 amino acids. RT-PCR
analysis of RNAs from the HepG2 cell line, fetal brain cortex, liver,
lung, eye, and kidney showed that PKDL undergoes various alternative
splicing in these tissues. The PKDLdel456 variant appears to be
expressed only in transformed lymphoblasts.

GENE FUNCTION

Chen et al. (1999) demonstrated that polycystin-L is a calcium-modulated
nonselective cation channel that is permeable to sodium, potassium, and
calcium ions. Patch-clamp experiments revealed single-channel activity
with a unitary conductance of 137 picosiemens. Channel activity was
substantially increased when either the extracellular or intracellular
calcium-ion concentration was raised, indicating that polycystin-L may
act as a transducer of calcium-mediated signaling in vivo. Chen et al.
(1999) concluded that polycystin-L's large single-channel conductance
and regulation by calcium ions distinguish it from other structurally
related cation channels.

Huang et al. (2006) used a combination of bioinformatics, genetic, and
functional studies to identify PKD2L1 as a candidate mammalian sour
taste sensor. In the tongue, PKD2L1 is expressed in a subset of taste
receptor cells distinct from those responsible for sweet, bitter, and
umami taste. To examine the role of PKD2L1-expressing taste cells in
vivo, Huang et al. (2006) engineered mice with targeted genetic
ablations of selected populations of taste receptor cells. Animals
lacking PKD2L1-expressing cells were completely devoid of taste
responses to sour stimuli. Notably, responses to all other tastants
remained unaffected, proving that the segregation of taste qualities
even extends to ionic stimuli. Huang et al. (2006) concluded that their
results established independent cellular substrates for 4 of the 5 basic
taste modalities, and supported a comprehensive labeled-line mode of
taste coding at the periphery. Notably, PKD2L1 is also expressed in
specific neurons surrounding the central canal of the spinal cord. Huang
et al. (2006) demonstrated that these PKD2L1-expressing neurons send
projections to the central canal, and selectively trigger action
potentials in response to decreases in extracellular pH. The authors
proposed that these cells correspond to the long-sought components of
the cerebrospinal fluid chemosensory system. Huang et al. (2006)
proposed that their results suggest a common basis for acid sensing in
disparate physiologic settings.

Ishimaru et al. (2006) hypothesized that transient receptor potential
(TRP) ion channel proteins other than TRPM5 (604600) might be expressed
in taste cells and be involved in taste transduction. Using in situ
hybridization, they detected expression of Pkd1l3 (607895) and Pkd2l1 in
mouse circumvallate taste cells. Pkd2l1 was expressed in all 3 tongue
taste areas and in the palate taste area, whereas Pkd2l1 was expressed
in circumvallate and foliate papillae, but not in fungiform papillae or
in the palate. Confocal microscopy and coimmunoprecipitation analysis
revealed coexpression of Pkd1l3 and Pkd2l1, but not Trpm5, in the apical
ends of taste cells in circumvallate and foliate papillae. Coexpression
of Pkd1l3 and Pkd2l1 was necessary for inducing changes in intracellular
calcium concentration in response to acid solutions, suggesting that
PKD1L3/PKD2L1 heteromers function as sour taste receptors.

MAPPING

Nomura et al. (1998) mapped the PKDL gene to chromosome 10q24 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization and linked it to D10S603 by radiation
hybrid mapping. Nomura et al. (1998) mapped the mouse homolog of Pkdl to
a syntenic region of chromosome 19 that is deleted in Krd (kidney and
retinal defects) mice. By FISH and analysis of a somatic cell hybrid
mapping panel, Wu et al. (1998) mapped the PKD2L gene to chromosome
10q25. They excluded it as a candidate gene for autosomal recessive
polycystic kidney disease (263200), autosomal dominant polycystic liver
disease (174050), and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease-3
(600666).

608729	TITLE *608729 ANGIOTENSIN II RECEPTOR-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN; AGTRAP
;;ATRAP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using the C-terminal domain of murine At2r1a (106165) as bait in a yeast
2-hybrid screen, Daviet et al. (1999) cloned mouse Agtrap from a kidney
cDNA library. The deduced 161-amino acid protein has a calculated
molecular mass of 17.8 kD. It contains several extensive N-terminal
hydrophobic domains, as well as potential sites for phosphorylation and
N-glycosylation. Northern blot analysis detected transcripts of 1.2 and
0.8 kb in all mouse tissues examined, with relatively high levels in
kidney, testis, and heart. PCR also detected Agtrap expression in mouse
aortic tissue and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs).

By sequencing clones obtained from a fetal brain cDNA library, followed
by EST database analysis, Wang et al. (2002) cloned human AGTRAP. The
deduced 159-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 17.3
kD. AGTRAP has a 21-amino acid N-terminal transmembrane region that is
followed by a conserved cysteine, which is potentially palmitoylated.
Mouse and human AGTRAP share 74% amino acid homology. Northern blot
analysis detected a 1.2-kb transcript in almost all tissues examined,
with highest abundance in kidney, heart, pancreas, and thyroid.

GENE FUNCTION

By affinity chromatography and coimmunoprecipitation experiments, Daviet
et al. (1999) confirmed association between mouse Agtrap and At2r1a.
Agtrap interacted specifically with the C-terminal domain of At2r1a, but
not with the C-terminal domains of several other hormone receptors,
including AT2R2 (300034), CHRM3 (118494), BDKRB2 (113503), EDNRB
(131244), and ADRB2 (109690). Overexpression of Agtrap in COS-7 cells
inhibited At2r1a activation of phospholipase C (see 607120). It did not
affect Chrm3 activation.

Cui et al. (2000) determined that transfection of mouse Agtrap into
adult rat VSMCs potentiated At2r1 internalization upon angiotensin II
(see 106150) stimulation. Receptor-induced DNA synthesis was inhibited
in Agtrap-transfected VSMCs, and this was associated with inhibition of
Stat3 (102582) and Akt (see 164730) phosphorylation. Cui et al. (2000)
concluded that AGTRAP is a negative regulator of AT2R1-mediated cell
proliferation in VSMCs.

Using several assays of protein interaction, Wang et al. (2002) showed
that AGTRAP interacted with RACK1 (176981). They suggested that the
AGTRAP-RACK1 interaction may help recruit the signaling complex to AT2R1
and affect receptor signaling.

Using a yeast 2-hybrid assay, Guo et al. (2005) demonstrated that mouse
Caml (CAMLG; 601118) interacted with Atrap. The N-terminal hydrophilic
domain of Caml mediated the interaction, and the proteins colocalized in
the endoplasmic reticulum. Atrap knockdown increased NFAT (see NFATC2;
600490) activity, and overexpression of Atrap decreased angiotensin II-
or Caml-induced NFAT transcriptional activation. Overexpression of the
N-terminal ATRAP-interacting domain of Caml increased angiotensin
II-induced NFAT promoter activity, whereas overexpression of the
C-terminal end of Caml disrupted the effect of angiotensin II on NFAT
signaling.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the AGTRAP
gene to chromosome 1 (TMAP SHGC-32094).

;;EARLY DEVELOPMENT REGULATOR 2; EDR2;;
POLYHOMEOTIC, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, 2;;
HUMAN POLYHOMEOTIC HOMOLOG 2; HPH2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

In Drosophila melanogaster, the 'Polycomb' group (PcG) genes are part of
a cellular memory system that is responsible for the stable inheritance
of gene activity. PcG proteins form a large multimeric,
chromatin-associated protein complex. Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen,
Gunster et al. (1997) identified leukocyte cDNAs encoding a protein that
interacted with BMI1 (164831), a vertebrate PcG protein. The protein was
designated HPH2 because it had homology to the Drosophila PcG protein
'polyhomeotic' (Ph) as well as to mouse Rae28/Mph1 (see HPH1, 602978).
All 3 proteins contain a zinc finger motif and 2 regions designated
homology domains I and II. The results of 2-hybrid analysis indicated
that homology domains I and II are involved in protein-protein
interactions and may mediate heterodimerization of HPH1 and HPH2. HPH1
and HPH2 coimmunoprecipitate and cofractionate with each other and with
BMI1. By immunofluorescence, Gunster et al. (1997) determined that all 3
proteins colocalize in large domains in interphase nuclei of human
cells. The authors concluded that HPH1, HPH2, and BMI1 are part of a
common, multimeric protein complex. Northern blot analysis revealed that
HPH2 was expressed ubiquitously as a 2.5-kb transcript.

GENE FUNCTION

Wang et al. (2004) showed that an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which
they designated Polycomb repressive complex-1-like (PRC1L), specifically
monoubiquitinates histone-2A (H2A; see 142711) at lys119. They found
that PRC1L is composed of several PcG proteins, including RING1
(602045), RNF2 (608985), BMI1, and HPH2. Reduction of RNF2 expression
resulted in a dramatic decrease in the level of ubiquitinated H2A in
HeLa cells. Wang et al. (2004) proposed that H2A ubiquitination is
linked to Polycomb silencing.

;;SMALL EDRK-RICH FACTOR 1; SERF1;;
SPINAL MUSCULAR ATROPHY-RELATED GENE H4F5; H4F5;;
SMA MODIFIER 1; SMAM1
DESCRIPTION Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) has been classified into 3 types based on
age of onset and severity. SMA I-III all map to 5q13, and nearly all
patients display deletions or gene conversions of the SMN1 gene
(600354). Although some correlation has been established between SMN
protein levels and disease course, the genetic basis for SMA phenotypic
variability is mainly unexplained, and it had been postulated that the
loss of an additional modifying factor contributes to the severity of
type I SMA. Scharf et al. (1998) found that a multicopy microsatellite
marker deleted in more than 90% of type I SMA chromosomes was embedded
in an intron of H4F5, indicating that this gene is also highly deleted
in type I SMA chromosomes, and thus is a candidate phenotypic modifier
for SMA. The microsatellite marker, designated C212, is located in the
last intron of H4F5, 5 kb upstream of H4F5 exon 3b and 13 kb upstream of
SMN exon 1. In 58 type I SMA patients of varied European and Arabian
descent, Scharf et al. (1998) found a reduction or absence of C212/H4F5
alleles in 94% of chromosomes, implying a deletion of 1 or both copies
of the marker and therefore of H4F5 exon 3b in these individuals. In
comparison with the high rate of C212/H4F5 deletions in type I SMA, the
C212 deletion frequency in type II SMA chromosomes was between that of
type I and control chromosomes, whereas deletions in type III
chromosomes were only slightly more frequent than in controls.

Scharf et al. (1998) sequenced a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)
containing the mouse Smn gene to identify conserved elements between the
human SMA interval and its previously identified syntenic region on
mouse chromosome 13 (Scharf et al., 1996). The resulting sequence was
filtered for repetitive elements and used to screen the EST database.
ESTs corresponding to SMN and NAIP were identified as well as 2 ESTs
representing novel genes within the BAC. One of these ESTs, clone
368449, mapped to 10.6 kb upstream of mouse Smn; subsequent analysis of
surrounding genomic sequences using 4 exon-prediction programs
identified no additional transcripts between 368449 and Smn or between
Smn and Naip. The full-length 566-bp mouse 368449 cDNA and its human
ortholog were cloned from a mouse brain and human skeletal muscle cDNA
library, respectively. The human clone was 99% homologous to exon 4F5,
an exon previously trapped from an SMA cosmid known to contain SMN exon
1. The full-length human cDNA was named H4F5, and its mouse counterpart
M4f5, until an appropriate function can be assigned to the 2 genes. The
proteins displayed 97% amino acid similarity to one another and both
genes were ubiquitously expressed with highest RNA levels in testis. In
addition, H4F5 has a larger 1.8-kb isoform, H4F5L, with a predicted
110-amino acid open reading frame that results from alternative splicing
of exon 3. In contrast to the 0.6-kb mouse and 0.7-kb human 4F5S
isoforms, the 1.8-kb H4F5L transcript is predominantly expressed in
heart, brain, and skeletal muscle. Both isoforms are also expressed
throughout the central nervous system, including spinal cord, which is
the tissue primarily affected in SMA. H4F5 was found to lie closer to
SMN1 than any previously identified gene in the region.
