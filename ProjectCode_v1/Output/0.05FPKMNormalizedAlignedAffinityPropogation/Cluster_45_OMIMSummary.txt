607526	TITLE *607526 RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN L27; RPL27
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By differential screening of fetal and adult kidney mRNA, Gallagher et
al. (1994) cloned RPL27 as 1 of several transcripts showing high
expression during fetal development. The deduced 135-amino acid protein
has a calculated molecular mass of about 18 kD. RPL27 shares 100% amino
acid identity with rat and chicken Rpl27, although there are several
silent base pair changes at the DNA level. Northern blot analysis
revealed expression of a 1.0-kb transcript or 2 transcripts of 1.0 and
1.25 kb in fetal kidney. The 1.0-kb transcript was present at lower
levels in adult kidney. RPL27 expression was also detected in several
other fetal tissues, including muscle, liver, lung, heart, and brain.
The 1.0-kb transcript was present in adult muscle at lower levels than
in fetal muscle. Gallagher et al. (1994) determined that RPL27 was
downregulated 20-fold in adult kidney compared with fetal kidney.

GENE FUNCTION

Using RT-PCR, Sim et al. (2010) found that a subset of genes encoding
proteins of the large ribosomal subunit was differentially expressed in
nasopharyngeal carcinoma (see 607107) cell lines compared with a normal
nasopharyngeal epithelial cell line. RPL27 was 1 of 3 genes
significantly downregulated in the carcinoma cell lines.

MAPPING

By Southern blot analysis, Gallagher et al. (1994) determined that there
are multiple RPL27 copies in the genome. The International Radiation
Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the RPL27 gene to chromosome 17 (TMAP
RH26918).

604597	TITLE *604597 GLUTAMATE RECEPTOR-INTERACTING PROTEIN 1; GRIP1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The recruitment of signaling molecules to the plasma membrane is a
prerequisite for the functioning of various signaling cascades. Correct
localization within the plasma membrane is equally important, as the
membrane itself is highly organized into lipid domains that provide
subcompartments. These small (less than 100 nm) membrane domains, called
rafts, are enriched in sphingolipids and cholesterol and can incorporate
GPI-anchored proteins, specific transmembrane proteins, and doubly
acylated proteins like tyrosine kinases of the Src family. Rafts have
been proposed to function as platforms for the localized concentration
and activation of signaling molecules. Transmembrane ephrin B proteins
have important roles during embryonic patterning as ligands for Eph
receptor tyrosine kinases and presumably as signal-transducing
receptor-like molecules. Ephrin B1 (EFNB1; 300035) is localized in raft
microdomains. Using a yeast 2-hybrid system to identify proteins that
bind to the cytoplasmic domain of EFNB1, Bruckner et al. (1999) isolated
a partial human fetal brain cDNA encoding GRIP1. The predicted GRIP1
protein, which lacks the N-terminal region, contains a partial PDZ3
domain and intact PDZ4 through PDZ7 domains. GRIP1 binds to the C
terminus of EFNB1, which contains a PDZ-binding consensus motif. In situ
hybridization of embryonic day 17 (E17) rat embryos showed that Grip1 is
expressed relatively homogeneously and strongly throughout most regions
of the nervous system. Grip1 was expressed at very low levels in many
nonneuronal tissues of embryonic day 17 rat, with the highest levels
found in nasal cavities and major blood vessels. Coimmunoprecipitation
analysis demonstrated that Grip1 and Efnb1 interact in embryonic day 14
mouse embryos. Bruckner et al. (1999) found that GRIP1 is recruited into
rafts through association with EFNB1. In addition, a GRIP1-associated
serine/threonine kinase activity was recruited into EFNB1/GRIP1
complexes. Bruckner et al. (1999) suggested that GRIP proteins provide a
scaffold for the assembly of a multiprotein signaling complex downstream
of ephrin B ligands.

GENE FUNCTION

Setou et al. (2002) demonstrated that an AMPA receptor (AMPAR)
subunit--GluR2-interacting protein (GRIP1)--can directly interact and
steer kinesin heavy chains to dendrites as a motor for AMPARs. As would
be expected if this complex is functional, both gene targeting and
dominant-negative experiments of heavy chains of mouse kinesin showed
abnormal localization of GRIP1. Moreover, expression of the
kinesin-binding domain of GRIP1 resulted in accumulation of the
endogenous kinesin predominantly in the somatodendritic area. This
pattern was different from that generated by overexpression of the
kinesin-binding scaffold protein JSAP1 (605431), which occurred
predominantly in the somatoaxon area. Setou et al. (2002) concluded that
directly binding proteins can determine the traffic direction of a motor
protein.

Contractor et al. (2002) reported that mossy fiber long-term
potentiation was reduced by perfusion of postsynaptic neurons with
peptides and antibodies that interfere with binding of EphB receptor
tyrosine kinases to the PDZ protein GRIP1. Mossy fiber long-term
potentiation was also reduced by extracellular application of soluble
forms of beta-ephrins, which are normally membrane-anchored presynaptic
ligands for the EphB receptors. The application of soluble ligands for
presynaptic ephrins increased basal excitatory transmission and occluded
both tetanus and forskolin-induced synaptic potentiation. Contractor et
al. (2002) concluded that the PDZ interactions in postsynaptic neuron
and transsynaptic interactions between postsynaptic EphB receptors and
presynaptic beta-ephrins are necessary for the induction of mossy fiber
long-term potentiation.

At rat cerebellar parallel fiber-stellate cell synapses, Ca(2+) influx
through Glur2 (GRIA2; 138247)-lacking AMPARs drives incorporation of
Ca(2+)-impermeable Glur2-containing AMPARs, generating rapid changes in
excitatory postsynaptic current properties. Liu and Cull-Candy (2005)
found that repetitive synaptic activity triggered loss of
Ca(2+)-permeable AMPARs by disrupting their interaction with Grip. Pick
(PICK1; 605926) drove activity-dependent delivery of Ca(2+)-impermeable
receptors into the synaptic membrane. Liu and Cull-Candy (2005)
concluded that dynamic regulation of AMPARs by GRIP and PICK provides a
mechanism for controlling Ca(2+) permeability of synaptic receptors.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 2 unrelated male fetuses with typical features of Fraser syndrome
(219000), Vogel et al. (2012) identified homozygosity for a splice site
mutation in the GRIP1 gene (604597.0001). In addition, the
consanguineous parents of a third male fetus with Fraser syndrome were
found to be heterozygous for a 4-bp deletion in the GRIP1 gene
(604597.0002); no DNA was available from the presumably homozygous
fetus.

ANIMAL MODEL

Bladt et al. (2002) found that elimination of the mouse Grip1 gene
results in embryonic lethality. Null embryos developed abnormalities in
the dermo-epidermal junction, resulting in extensive skin blistering
around day 12 of embryonic life. Ultrastructural characterization of the
blisters (or bullae) revealed cleavage of the dermo-epidermal junction
below the lamina densa, an alteration reminiscent of the dystrophic form
of human epidermolysis bullosa (226600). Blisters were also observed in
the lateral ventricle of the brain and in the meninges covering the
cerebral cortex. Thus, it appears that GRIP1 scaffolding protein is
required for the formation and integrity of the dermo-epidermal junction
and that PDZ domains are important in the organization of supramolecular
structures essential for mammalian embryonic development.

Through the study of Grip1 -/- mice, Takamiya et al. (2004) found that
loss of the Grip1 protein leads to the formation of subepidermal
hemorrhagic blisters, renal agenesis, syndactyly or polydactyly, and
permanent fusion of eyelids (cryptophthalmos). Similar malformations are
characteristic of individuals with Fraser cryptophthalmos-syndactyly
syndrome (219000) and animal models of the human disorder, such as mice
carrying the 'blebbed' mutation (bl) in the Fras1 gene (607830), which
encodes an extracellular matrix protein. Grip1 can visibly interact with
Fras1 and is required for the localization of Fras1 to the basal side of
cells. In one animal model of Fraser syndrome, the 'eye-blebs' (eb)
mouse, Grip1 is disrupted by a deletion of 2 coding exons. From their
data, Takamiya et al. (2004) concluded that Grip1 is required for normal
cell-matrix interactions during early embryonic development and that
inactivation of Grip1 causes Fraser syndrome-like defects in mice.
Kiyozumi et al. (2006) showed that eb/eb mice had reduced localization
of Fras1, Frem1 (608944), and Frem2 (608945) to epidermal basement
membranes.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
FRASER SYNDROME
GRIP1, IVS17, G-C, +1

In 2 unrelated male fetuses with typical features of Fraser syndrome
(219000), Vogel et al. (2012) identified homozygosity for a +1G-C
transversion in intron 17 (2113+1G-C; based on GenBank GENBANK
NM_201150.3) of the GRIP1 gene, predicted to cause skipping of exon 17.
The unaffected consanguineous parents from both families were
heterozygous for the splice site mutation, which was not found in
multiple mutation and SNP databases or in more than 40 exomes sequenced
by the authors. Analysis of GRIP1 expression in 1 set of parents
revealed a 374-bp (wildtype) mRNA product as well as a 234-bp fragment
lacking exon 17, confirming that the splice site mutation causes a
frameshift resulting in a premature termination codon.

FRASER SYNDROME
GRIP1, 4-BP DEL, 1181AAGA

In the unaffected consanguineous parents of a male fetus with typical
features of Fraser syndrome (219000), Vogel et al. (2012) identified
heterozygosity for a 4-bp deletion (1181_1184delAAGA, based on GenBank
GENBANK NM_201150.3) in exon 10 of the GRIP1 gene, predicted to cause a
frameshift and premature termination codon. The fetus was presumed to be
homozygous for the deletion, although no DNA was available.

615051	TITLE *615051 ANKYRIN REPEAT- AND SOCS BOX-CONTAINING PROTEIN 6; ASB6
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Proteins of the ASB family, such as ASB6, contain central tandem ankyrin
(see 612641) repeats and a C-terminal suppressor of cytokine signaling
(SOCS) box. SOCS box proteins are predicted to be involved in protein
degradation by acting as a bridge between substrate proteins and E3
ubiquitin protein ligases (see 601623) (review by Kile et al., 2002).

CLONING

Kile et al. (2001) showed that the deduced 418-amino acid mouse Asb6
protein has 8 tandem ankyrin repeats and a C-terminal SOCS box.

GENE FUNCTION

Kohroki et al. (2005) found that epitope-tagged ASB6 and several other
ASB family members interacted with endogenous CUL5 (601741) and RBX2
(RNF7; 603863) in immunoprecipitated HEK293 cells. The ASB proteins did
not interact with CUL2 (603135) or RBX1 (603814).

MAPPING

Hartz (2013) mapped the ASB6 gene to chromosome 9q34.11 based on an
alignment of the ASB6 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK000555) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

612055	TITLE *612055 RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN S27-LIKE; RPS27L
;;RPS27-LIKE
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

He and Sun (2007) identified RPS27L as a p53 (TP53; 191170)-inducible
gene by microarray profiling using a human lung cancer cell model.
RPS27L shares 96.3% amino acid identity with RPS27 (603702). Expression
of RPS27L was detected in most human tissues and human cancer cell lines
examined.

GENE FUNCTION

He and Sun (2007) observed p53-dependent induction of RPS27L in multiple
human cancer cell models. Gel retardation and chromatin
immunoprecipitation assays showed that p53 bound to a putative
p53-binding site in RPS27L intron 1. p53 activated transcription of a
reporter gene driven by the RPS27L intron 1 sequence, and etoposide, a
DNA-damaging agent that upregulates p53 expression, increased expression
of the reporter gene. RPS27L expression promoted apoptosis following
etoposide exposure, whereas small interfering RNA against RPS27L
inhibited etoposide-induced apoptosis. He and Sun (2007) concluded that
p53 induces expression of RPS27L, which in turn promotes apoptosis.

GENE STRUCTURE

He and Sun (2007) determined that the RPS27L gene contains 4 exons. The
5-prime end of intron 1 contains a consensus p53-binding site.

MAPPING

Hartz (2008) mapped the RPS27L gene to chromosome 15q22.2 based on an
alignment of the RPS27L sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK024591) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.1).

603291	TITLE *603291 BCL2/ADENOVIRUS E1B 19-KD PROTEIN-INTERACTING PROTEIN 1; BNIP1
;;NIP1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a yeast 2-hybrid system to identify proteins that interact with
discrete domains of the E1B 19-kD protein, which is involved in
suppression of cell death, Boyd et al. (1994) cloned human B-cell cDNAs
encoding NIP1, NIP2 (603292), and NIP3 (603293). The deduced NIP1
protein has 228 amino acids and contains a putative membrane-spanning
hydrophobic domain. Although the authors found no significant sequence
homology between NIP1 and other proteins, they identified a 59- to
83-amino acid region of NIP1 that shows 29% to 36% identity to a
conserved region within the catalytic domain of 3 mammalian
3-prime-5-prime-cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases. Boyd et al. (1994)
localized NIP1 to the nuclear envelope region and to other cytoplasmic
structures.

GENE FUNCTION

Adenovirus E1B 19-kD protein protects against cell death induced by
viral infection and certain external stimuli. Using yeast 2-hybrid
analysis, Boyd et al. (1994) showed that NIP1, NIP2, and NIP3 interacted
with the adenovirus E1B 19-kD protein and with human BCL2 (151430),
which can functionally substitute for the 19-kD protein during
adenovirus infection. The interactions occurred at bipartite sequence
motifs common to both the E1B 19-kD and BCL2 proteins.

MAPPING

Gross (2012) mapped the BNIP1 gene to chromosome 5q35.1 based on an
alignment of the BNIP1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF083956) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

606046	TITLE *606046 SYNTAXIN 18; STX18
DESCRIPTION In eukaryotic cells, SNARE proteins (SNAP receptors) mediate the docking
and/or fusion of transport vesicles with target membranes. See
alpha-SNAP (NAPA; 603215). V-SNARES, found on vesicles, interact with
t-SNARES (syntaxins), found on target membranes, in a specific manner.

CLONING

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen with NAPA cDNA as bait, Hatsuzawa et al.
(2000) identified a partial human cDNA encoding a novel syntaxin, which
they called syntaxin-18. They isolated a complete cDNA by screening a
human brain cDNA library. The deduced 335-amino acid protein contains
elements similar to other syntaxins, including predicted coiled-coil
regions and a putative transmembrane domain near the C terminus.
Syntaxin-18 shares 28% sequence identity with the C. elegans T10H9
predicted gene product, but low sequence similarity to other known
syntaxins. Northern blot analysis detected ubiquitous expression of a
1.8-kb STX18 transcript. Using subcellular fractionation and
immunofluorescence, Hatsuzawa et al. (2000) showed that syntaxin-18 is
principally located in the endoplasmic reticulum.

GENE FUNCTION

Based on in vivo overexpression and protein transport studies using
epitope-tagged proteins, Hatsuzawa et al. (2000) suggested that
syntaxin-18 functions in transport between the endoplasmic reticulum and
Golgi.

611534	TITLE *611534 NUCLEOLAR PROTEIN 8; NOL8
;;NOP132
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

NOL8 is a nucleolar protein that functions in ribosome biogenesis
(Sekiguchi et al., 2006).

CLONING

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis using RRAGA (612194) as bait, followed by
database analysis and RT-PCR of HeLa RNA, Sekiguchi et al. (2004) cloned
NOL8, which they called NOP132. The deduced 1,168-amino acid protein has
a calculated molecular mass of 132 kD and shares 83.8% and 70.7% amino
acid identity with its mouse ortholog over the N-terminal and C-terminal
regions, respectively. NOL8 contains a C-terminal nuclear localization
signal and 3 predicted coiled-coil structures. Immunofluorescence and
immunocytochemical studies localized NOL8 to the nucleolus.

Using cDNA microarray analysis of 20 diffuse-type gastric cancers,
Jinawath et al. (2004) identified NOL8 as a gene upregulated
specifically in gastric cancer tissues compared to noncancerous mucosa.
NOL8 has an N-terminal RNA recognition motif (RRM) domain and a
C-terminal KOG4365 domain. Northern blot analysis detected a 4.4-kb
transcript in skeletal muscle with little-to-no expression in 22 other
tissues examined. Semiquantitative RT-PCR detected NOL8 expression in 7
gastric cancer cell lines; all cell lines showed higher NOL8 expression
than normal skeletal muscle. Immunoblot analysis with lambda-protein
phosphatase demonstrated that NOL8 is phosphorylated.

GENE FUNCTION

Sekiguchi et al. (2004) showed that NOL8 expressed in Sf9 insect cells
coimmunoprecipitated with RRAGA, RRAGC (608267), and RRAGD (608268). By
yeast 2-hybrid analysis with RRAGA mutants, they found that NOL8 bound
specifically to GTP-bound RRAGA but not to GDP-bound RRAGA. Yeast
2-hybrid analysis and GST pull-down assays demonstrated that NOL8
interacted with NIP7. In baby hamster fibroblasts, NOL8 colocalized in
the nucleus with RRAGA and NIP7, respectively. Deletion analysis and
additional interaction assays showed that the NOL8 C-terminal amino
acids 966-1116 mediated interaction with NIP7, RRAGA, and RRAGC.
Antisense oligonucleotide inhibition of NOL8 caused dose-dependent
growth suppression in HeLa cells that was accompanied by reduced DNA
synthesis.

Jinawath et al. (2004) showed that siRNA knockdown of NOL8 suppressed
growth in gastric cancer cells. FACS analysis of the NOL8-knockdown
cells showed an increase in the sub-G1 population. Jinawath et al.
(2004) concluded that suppression of NOL8 expression induced apoptosis.

Sekiguchi et al. (2006) characterized proteins that immunoprecipitated
with epitope-tagged NOP132 from human 293EBNA cells. Mass spectrometric
and database analyses revealed many proteins from the large and small
ribosomal subunits, as well as proteins previously characterized in
human pre-ribosomal nucleoprotein complexes. The putative RNA helicases
DDX18 (606355) and DDX47 (615428) were also detected in NOP132
immunoprecipitates. A similar complement of proteins immunoprecipitated
with DDX18 or DDX47. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments confirmed
association of NOP132 with DDX18 and DDX47, but not with other DDX
proteins. RNase treatment significantly decreased association of NOP132
with DDX18 and DDX47, suggesting that their interaction depends on RNA.
Similarly, RNase treatment released most of the NOP132-, DDX18-, and
DDX47-associated proteins. NOP132, DDX18, and DDX47 colocalized with the
nucleolar protein KIAA0559 (NAP1; 608865) in HeLa cells, and knockdown
of NOP132 by small interfering RNA caused mislocalization of DDX47 to
the nucleolar periphery. Mutation analysis revealed that the coiled-coil
region of NOP132 interacted with the HELICc motif of DDX47. Sekiguchi et
al. (2006) concluded that NOP132 is required for proper targeting of
DDX47 to the nucleolar organizing region during ribosome biogenesis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Jinawath et al. (2004) determined that the NOL8 gene contains 16 exons
spanning 30 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Jinawath et al. (2004) mapped the NOL8
gene to chromosome 9q22.32.

;;VALACYCLOVIRASE;;
MUCIN-ASSOCIATED ANTIGEN; MCNAA;;
BREAST EPITHELIAL MUCIN-ASSOCIATED ANTIGEN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The serine hydrolases, including BPHL, are defined as a functional class
of hydrolytic enzymes that contain a serine residue in their active
site. They can be grouped into subfamilies that contain closely related
members in terms of substrate specificity or amino acid sequence
similarity (Puente and Lopez-Otin, 1995).

CLONING

By immunoscreening an expression library prepared from human lactating
breast tissue, Larocca et al. (1990) obtained a partial BPHL cDNA, which
they called BA70-1. Northern blot analysis detected a major 1.8-kb
transcript and a minor 0.65-kb transcript in human breast tumor cell
lines and several other carcinoma cell lines.

Puente and Lopez-Otin (1995) isolated a full-length human breast
carcinoma cDNA encoding a novel serine hydrolase, BPHL. The deduced
274-amino acid protein shows significant sequence similarity to
prokaryotic enzymes involved in the degradation of aromatic compounds;
the highest identities, about 25%, are to 4 serine hydrolases encoded by
the bphD genes of different strains of Pseudomonas, all of which degrade
biphenyl derivatives. Recombinant BPHL protein demonstrated serine
hydrolase activity that was abolished by a covalent inhibitor of serine
hydrolases. By Northern blot analysis of human tissues, the authors
detected a major 1.8-kb BPHL transcript, with highest levels in liver
and kidney, and a minor 2.4-kb transcript. They showed that BPHL is
expressed as an approximately 30-kD protein in human liver using Western
blot analysis.

GENE FUNCTION

Valacyclovir (VACV) is the 5-prime valyl ester prodrug of acyclovir, an
effective antiherpetic drug. VACV is relatively stable in gut lumen
while very susceptible to intracellular enzymatic hydrolysis. Kim et al.
(2003) found that the VACV hydrolase associated with human colon
carcinoma cell membranes is BPHL. Gel filtration chromatography detected
the enzyme at an apparent molecular mass of 27 kD. Hydrolysis of VACV by
recombinant BPHL was concentration-dependent, showed highest activity in
the pH range of 7.4 to 8.0, and was sensitive to serine hydrolase
inhibitors and a free thiol modifier, suggesting that cysteines as well
as serines have a role in the catalytic function of BPHL.

GENE STRUCTURE

Puente et al. (1998) determined that the BPHL gene spans approximately
30 kb and contains 8 exons.

MAPPING

By FISH, Puente et al. (1998) localized the BPHL gene to chromosome
6p25.

605454	TITLE *605454 ATP-BINDING CASSETTE, SUBFAMILY B, MEMBER 10; ABCB10
;;MITOCHONDRIAL ABC PROTEIN 2; MABC2; MTABC2
DESCRIPTION For background information on the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family of
transporter proteins, see ABCA4 (601691).

CLONING

In addition to the 'full' ABC transporters with 2 transmembrane domains
and 2 nucleotide-binding domains, there are 'half' proteins that contain
only 1 of each domain (e.g., ABCB1; 171050). By screening an acute
lymphoblastic leukemia cDNA library and a genomic DNA library with an
EST probe, Zhang et al. (2000) isolated a cDNA encoding ABCB10, a
738-amino acid half transporter. Phylogenetic analysis determined that
ABCB10 is well conserved and most similar to human MABC1 (ABCB8;
605464). Northern blot analysis detected a 4.0-kb transcript in all
tissues tested, with highest levels in bone marrow, low levels in lung,
kidney, spleen, thymus, and colon, and intermediate levels in all other
tissues. Western blot and confocal microscopy analyses showed that
ABCB10 was expressed as a 60-kD nonglycosylated mitochondrial membrane
protein.

GENE FUNCTION

Using protein pull-down and coimmunoprecipitation analyses, Chen et al.
(2009) showed that the mouse mitochondrial iron transporter Mfrn1
(SLC25A37; 610387) interacted with Abcb10. Cotransfection of Abcb10 with
Mfrn1 in COS-7 cells enhanced the half-life of Mfrn1. Conversely,
knockdown of Abcb10 via small interfering RNA caused Mfrn1 instability.
Coexpression of Abcb10 with Mfrn1 in mouse erythroleukemia (MEL) cells
increased total mitochondrial uptake of radiolabeled Fe, but it did not
alter the incorporation of Fe into heme. Use of Mfrn1-Mfrn2 (SLC25A28;
609767) chimeras localized the Abcb10-interacting domain to the
N-terminal region of Mfrn1. Chen et al. (2009) observed that proteolytic
processing of Abcb10 and targeting of Abcb10 to the mitochondrial
membrane paralleled induction of Mfrn1 protein during MEL cell
differentiation. Chen et al. (2009) concluded that formation of the
MFRN1-ABCB10 complex stabilizes MFRN1, resulting in increased
mitochondrial iron incorporation.

MAPPING

Allikmets et al. (1995) mapped a partial EST corresponding to the ABCB10
gene to chromosome 1q42. However, using FISH, Zhang et al. (2000) mapped
the full-length ABCB10 gene to chromosome 15q13-q14. PCR and Southern
blot analysis of genomic DNA showed that the chromosome 15 localization
represents a pseudogene.

603945	TITLE *603945 EUKARYOTIC TRANSLATION INITIATION FACTOR 2B, SUBUNIT 5; EIF2B5
;;EUKARYOTIC TRANSLATION INITIATION FACTOR 2B, EPSILON;;
EIF2B-EPSILON
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The EIF2B5 gene encodes a subunit of eIF2B, a heteropentameric guanine
nucleotide exchange factor necessary for the proper function of the
translation initiation factor eIF2 (see 603907). EIF2B catalyzes the
exchange of GDP for GTP (summary by Asuru et al., 1996).

CLONING

Asuru et al. (1996) isolated a rabbit reticulocyte cDNA encoding the
epsilon subunit of eIF2B. The predicted 721-amino acid protein migrates
at approximately 84 kD by SDS-PAGE. The authors stated that the
N-terminal region of eIF2B-epsilon contains a putative
nucleotide-binding domain that may be directly involved in nucleotide
exchange. By screening a human histiocytic lymphoma cell line library
with the rabbit cDNA, Asuru et al. (1996) identified a partial cDNA
encoding human eIF2B-epsilon. The deduced partial human protein contains
641 amino acids and is 90% identical to rabbit eIF2B-epsilon.

GENE STRUCTURE

Leegwater et al. (2001) determined that the EIF2B5 gene contains 16
exons.

GENE FUNCTION

Fogli et al. (2004) measured the guanine nucleotide exchange factor
(GEF) activity of EIF2B in transformed lymphocytes from 30 patients with
leukoencephalopathies (603896) with homozygous or compound heterozygous
mutations in EIF2B2 (606454), EIF2B3 (606273), EIF2B4 (606687), and
EIF2B5 compared to 10 unaffected heterozygotes and 22 controls with no
EIF2B mutation. A significant decrease of 20 to 70% in GEF activity was
observed in all mutated cells, and the extent of the decrease correlated
with age at onset of disease. Fogli et al. (2004) suggested that a
deficiency in GEF activity underlies the encephalopathy in EIF2B-related
disease.

In cell cultures from the brain of an individual with VWM who had
compound heterozygosity for mutations in EIF2B5 (T91A, 603945.0001 and
W628R, 603945.0002), Dietrich et al. (2005) observed prompt development
of normal-appearing oligodendrocytes despite the extensive demyelination
seen in the patient. However, few glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP;
137780)-expressing astrocytes were present in primary cultures,
induction of astrocytes was severely compromised, and the few astrocytes
generated showed abnormal morphologies and antigenic phenotypes. Lesions
in vivo also lacked GFAP-expressing astrocytes, and RNA-interference
targeting of EIF2B5 severely compromised the induction of
GFAP-expressing cells from normal human glial progenitors. Dietrich et
al. (2005) suggested that a deficiency in astrocyte function may
contribute to the loss of white matter in VWM leukodystrophy.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Individuals with leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter (VWM;
603896) initially develop normally or close to normally. Neurologic
deterioration usually begins in late infancy or early childhood, but
juvenile- and adult-onset cases have been described. Mild and severe
cases have been observed, even within families. The neurologic signs
include progressive cerebellar ataxia, spasticity, inconstant optic
atrophy, and relatively preserved mental abilities. Disease is
chronic-progressive with, in most individuals, additional episodes of
rapid deterioration following febrile infections or minor head trauma.
Head trauma leads only to motor deterioration, whereas infections with
fever may end in coma. Death occurs after a variable period of several
years to a few decades, usually following an episode of fever and coma.
MRI is diagnostic and shows a diffuse abnormality of the cerebral white
matter beginning in the presymptomatic stage. Both MRI and magnetic
resonance spectroscopy indicate that, with time, an increasing amount of
the abnormal white matter vanishes and is replaced by cerebrospinal
fluid. The mode of inheritance is autosomal recessive. Leegwater et al.
(1999) mapped the disorder to 3q27 and Leegwater et al. (2001) narrowed
the location to a region containing a total of 25 genes and STSs. One of
these genes, EIF2B5, was found to contain 16 different mutations in 29
patients from 23 families.

Leegwater et al. (2001) found mutations in the gene encoding the beta
subunit of eIF2B (EIF2B2; 606454) in 4 other patients. As eIF2B has an
essential role in the regulation of translation under different
conditions, including stress, Leegwater et al. (2001) suggested that
this may explain the rapid deterioration of people with VWM under
stress. Mutant translation initiation factors had not theretofore been
implicated in disease. Mutations in a gene for a modulator of eIF2-eIF2B
activity, EIF2AK3 (604032), cause Wolcott-Rallison syndrome (226980).
This syndrome is characterized by the malfunctioning of multiple organs
and tissues. EIF2AK3 encodes a kinase that specifically phosphorylates
the alpha-subunit of eIF2, which suggests that the syndrome is caused by
a failure to downregulate translation under stress conditions that would
normally enhance eIF2AK3 activity. EIF2AK3 is probably not essential for
survival, as patients homozygous for nonsense mutations at this locus
have been identified. In VWM only the brain is affected.

Cree leukoencephalopathy (CLE) is a rapidly fatal infantile autosomal
recessive leukodystrophy observed in the indigenous Cree and Chippewayan
populations in northern Quebec and Manitoba. Fogli et al. (2002) found
the typical foamy cells with the oligodendroglial phenotype described in
CACH/VWM in the brains of individuals with CLE. They studied the EIF2B5
gene in 3 patients of 2 Cree families and identified a homozygous
missense mutation (R195H; 603945.005).

Fogli et al. (2003) identified mutations in the EIF2B2, EIF2B4 (606687),
and EIF2B5 genes in patients with VWM with ovarian failure, which they
referred to as ovarioleukodystrophy (see 603896).

Three novel missense mutations in the EIF2B5 gene were identified by van
der Knaap et al. (2003).

Fogli et al. (2004) found that 42 of 68 (62%) VWM families had mutations
in the EIF2B5 gene; 71% of those had the R113H mutation (603945.0004).

In 6 of 11 unrelated Chinese patients with VWM disease, Wu et al. (2009)
identified homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the EIF2B5
gene, including 3 novel missense mutations and a deletion.

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

Van der Lei et al. (2010) identified mutations in the EIF2B5 gene in 126
(68%) of 184 patients from a large database of patients with
leukoencephalopathy with VWM disease. A subset of these patients were
chosen for study, including 23 with a homozygous R113H mutation
(603945.0004), 49 who had R113H in the compound heterozygous state, 8
with a homozygous T91A mutation (603945.0001), 9 with R113H/R339any, and
7 with T91A/R339any. Patients homozygous for R113H had a milder disease
than patients who were compound heterozygous for R113H and patients
homozygous for T91A. Patients with R113H/R339any had a milder phenotype
than patients with T91A/R339any. Finally, females tended to have a
milder disease than males. Van der Lei et al. (2010) concluded that the
clinical phenotype in VWM is influenced by the combination of both
mutations.

In a 53-year-old Japanese man with adult-onset VWM, Matsukawa et al.
(2011) identified a homozygous missense mutation in the EIF2B5 gene
(D270H; 603945.0012). In vitro functional expression studies showed that
the GDP/GTP exchange activity of eIF2B containing mutant EIF2B5 was
significantly decreased (30% decrease) compared to wildtype, although
the decrease was not as much as observed in mutations associated with
childhood-onset VWM. The findings suggested that mutations that result
in residual eIF2B activity may be associated with a later age at disease
onset.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
LEUKOENCEPHALOPATHY WITH VANISHING WHITE MATTER
EIF2B5, THR91ALA

In 12 persons with VWM (603896) in 9 families who shared a haplotype
designated 'EN' because a large number of their ancestors lived in a
rural region in the eastern part of the Netherlands, Leegwater et al.
(2001) found homozygosity for a 271A-G transition in exon 2 of the
EIF2B5 gene, resulting in an amino acid change of threonine to alanine
at codon 91 (T91A).

.0002
LEUKOENCEPHALOPATHY WITH VANISHING WHITE MATTER
EIF2B5, TRP628ARG

In a patient with VWM (603896), Leegwater et al. (2001) found an 1882T-C
transition in exon 14 of the EIF2B5 gene, resulting in a trp628-to-arg
(W628R) amino acid substitution. The exon 14 mutation was in compound
heterozygous state with the T91A mutation (603945.0001).

.0003
LEUKOENCEPHALOPATHY WITH VANISHING WHITE MATTER
EIF2B5, GLY386VAL

In 2 patients with VWM (603896), Leegwater et al. (2001) found compound
heterozygosity for a gly386-to-val (G386V) mutation and an arg113-to-his
mutation (603945.0004) in the EIF2B5 gene. The G386V amino acid
substitution was the result of an 1157G-T transversion that affected the
first nucleotide in exon 8 and may have disturbed splicing.

.0004
LEUKOENCEPHALOPATHY WITH VANISHING WHITE MATTER, ADULT-ONSET
OVARIOLEUKODYSTROPHY, INCLUDED
EIF2B5, ARG113HIS

See 603945.0003 and Leegwater et al. (2001). The arg113-to-his (R113H)
substitution results from a 338G-A transition in the EIF2B5 gene.
Leegwater et al. (2001) identified the R113H mutation in 12 families
with VWM (603896), with a total allelic frequency of approximately 20%
in the group of affected individuals that they investigated.

In a woman with adult onset of VWM diagnosed at the age of 27 years,
Biancheri et al. (2003) identified homozygosity for the R113H mutation,
which they originally incorrectly reported as R118H.

In 3 of 6 families with ovarioleukodystrophy (603896), Fogli et al.
(2003) identified the R113H mutation. Patients from these families had
the mildest form of the disease. Fogli et al. (2003) stated that the
R113H mutation had been found in 22% of chromosomes of 41 patients with
VWM (Leegwater et al., 2001). Because R113 is not conserved among
species, and because H is found at this position in rat and mouse, they
suggested that the homozygous R113H mutation in humans may not strongly
affect EIF2B5 function. One patient studied by Fogli et al. (2003), who
had early secondary amenorrhea, was a compound heterozygote for the
R113H mutation and an arg195-to-cys mutation (R195C; 603945.0007).

Van der Knaap et al. (2004) identified 6 individuals who were homozygous
for the R113H mutation; 2 of them were sibs. Five of the 6 had an
unusually mild form of VWM, 4 with a late-adolescent or adult onset, and
1 with childhood onset. One individual was asymptomatic at age 30 years.

.0005
LEUKOENCEPHALOPATHY WITH VANISHING WHITE MATTER
EIF2B5, ARG195HIS

Fogli et al. (2002) studied the EIF2B5 gene in 3 patients of 2 Cree
families with Cree leukoencephalopathy (603896) and identified a
homozygous G-to-A transition at nucleotide 584, resulting in an
arg195-to-his (R195H) substitution. They reported an unpublished
observation of the same R195H mutation in a CACH/VWM family from the
Highlands in Scotland. The northern Quebec Cree first encountered
Europeans in the early 1700s; these were Scottish fur traders from the
Hudson Bay Trading Company. Fogli et al. (2002) stated that the probands
from the 2 Cree families in their report could trace their paternal
ancestry to 3 English Hudson Bay Company employees around 1770.

.0006
LEUKOENCEPHALOPATHY WITH VANISHING WHITE MATTER
EIF2B5, LEU309VAL

In 2 sibs with a severe acute fatal infantile form of VWM (603896),
Fogli et al. (2002) identified a homozygous 925G-C mutation in the
EIF2B5 gene, resulting in a leu309-to-val (L309V) substitution. The
unaffected parents were heterozygous for the mutation.

.0007
OVARIOLEUKODYSTROPHY
EIF2B5, ARG195CYS

In a patient with ovarioleukodystrophy (603896) with early-onset
secondary amenorrhea, Fogli et al. (2003) found compound heterozygosity
for the arg113-to-his mutation (R113H; 603945.0004) and an arg195-to-cys
(R195C) mutation in the EIF2B5 gene. The R195C mutation resulted from a
C-to-T transition at nucleotide 583. The authors noted that the R195C
mutation involved the same codon as that mutated in Cree
leukoencephalopathy, which is caused by homozygosity for arg195 to his
(R195H; 603945.0005).

.0008
LEUKOENCEPHALOPATHY WITH VANISHING WHITE MATTER, ADULT-ONSET
EIF2B5, THR182MET

In a Japanese woman, born of consanguineous parents, with adult-onset
VWM (603896), Ohtake et al. (2004) identified a homozygous 545C-T
transition in exon 4 of the EIF2B5 gene, resulting in a thr182-to-met
(T182M) substitution. The patient presented with presenile dementia and
psychiatric symptoms.

.0009
LEUKOENCEPHALOPATHY WITH VANISHING WHITE MATTER
EIF2B5, ARG315HIS

In 4 patients from 2 unrelated families with early-onset VMW (603896),
Passemard et al. (2007) identified compound heterozygosity for mutations
in the EIF2B5 gene. In a brother and sister, they identified a 944G-A
transition resulting in an arg315-to-his (R315H) substitution and a
166T-G transversion resulting in a phe56-to-val (F56V; 603945.0010)
substitution. In 2 sisters, they identified the R315H mutation and a
167T-G transversion resulting in a phe56-to-cys (F56C; 603945.0011)
substitution. In the first family, the 2 sibs had acute neurologic
deterioration in infancy following viral infections. Brain MRIs showed
severe white matter abnormalities and complete disappearance of
hemispheric white matter, respectively. Both developed progressive
severe macrocephaly after age 3 years. In the second family, 1 sister
who survived beyond age 3 years developed macrocephaly. Passemard et al.
(2007) suggested that altered brain water balance may result in swelling
of the disease white matter and macrocephaly in some patients with VWM
disease.

EIF2B5, ASP270HIS

In a 53-year-old Japanese man, born of consanguineous parents, with
adult-onset VWM (603896), Matsukawa et al. (2011) identified a
homozygous 808G-C transversion in the EIF2B5 gene, resulting in an
asp270-to-his (D270H) substitution. The mutation was not found in 96
Japanese control individuals. The patient developed progressive gait
unsteadiness and miscalculation at age 50. In vitro functional
expression studies showed that the GDP/GTP exchange activity of eIF2B
containing mutant EIF2B5 was significantly decreased (30% decrease)
compared to wildtype, although the decrease was not as much as observed
in mutations associated with childhood-onset VWM. The findings suggested
that mutations that result in residual eIF2B activity may be associated
with a later age at disease onset.

603590	TITLE *603590 ACETYLGLUCOSAMINYLTRANSFERASE-LIKE PROTEIN; LARGE
;;KIAA0609;;
LIKE-GLYCOSYLTRANSFERASE
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Peyrard et al. (1999) investigated the gene content of a segment of
22q12.3-q13.1 that had been shown to contain meningioma-related genes
(156100) on the basis of studies of deletions. They characterized a
novel member of the N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase gene family, which
they designated the LARGE gene. The expression pattern of the human and
mouse LARGE orthologs is similar. Both genes are expressed ubiquitously,
consistent with their function as housekeeping genes. These genes are
also evolutionarily well conserved, as Peyrard et al. (1999) identified
an ortholog in C. elegans encoding a polypeptide that is 33% identical
with the human protein.

Brockington et al. (2005) noted that the 756-amino acid LARGE protein
contains an N-terminal transmembrane domain, a coiled-coil domain, and 2
catalytic domains.

GENE STRUCTURE

Peyrard et al. (1999) determined that the LARGE gene spans more than 664
kb of genomic DNA, making it the fifth largest in the human genome,
after dystrophin (DMD; 300377), with 2.3 Mb; DCC (120470), with 1.4 Mb;
GRM8 (601116), with 1 Mb; and utrophin (UTRN; 128240), with 900 kb. The
LARGE gene contains 16 exons (4,326-bp cDNA) and has an exon content of
less than 0.66%, which is similar to the exon content of the DMD gene
(0.6%).

MAPPING

Peyrard et al. (1999) mapped the LARGE gene to chromosome 22q12.3-q13.1,
a segment apparently poor in genes. By fluorescence in situ
hybridization, Peyrard et al. (1999) mapped the mouse Large gene to 8C1
in a region of conserved synteny with 22q12.3-q13.1.

GENE FUNCTION

Kanagawa et al. (2004) showed that both the N-terminal domain and a
portion of the mucin-like domain of alpha-dystroglycan (DAG1; 128239)
are essential for high-affinity laminin receptor function. They found
that posttranslational modification of alpha-dystroglycan by LARGE
occurs within the mucin-like domain, but the N-terminal domain interacts
with LARGE, defining an intracellular enzyme-substrate recognition motif
necessary to initiate functional glycosylation. Gene replacement in
dystroglycan-deficient muscle demonstrated that the dystroglycan
C-terminal domain is sufficient only for dystrophin-glycoprotein complex
assembly. To prevent muscle degeneration, expression of a functional
dystroglycan through LARGE recognition and glycosylation was required.
The authors concluded that molecular recognition of dystroglycan by
LARGE is a key determinant in the biosynthetic pathway to produce mature
and functional dystroglycan.

Brockington et al. (2005) transfected various cell lines with a variety
of LARGE expression constructs in order to characterize their
subcellular localization and effect on alpha-dystroglycan glycosylation.
Wildtype LARGE colocalized with the Golgi marker GM130 and stimulated
alpha-dystroglycan hyperglycosylation. The 2 predicted catalytic domains
of LARGE contain 3 conserved DxD motifs. Systematically mutating each of
these motifs to NNN resulted in the mislocalization of 1 construct, and
all failed to have any effect on alpha-dystroglycan glycosylation. A
construct lacking the transmembrane domain also failed to localize at
the Golgi apparatus. Brockington et al. (2005) concluded that LARGE
needs to both physically interact with alpha-dystroglycan and function
as a glycosyltransferase in order to stimulate alpha-dystroglycan
hyperglycosylation.

Inamori et al. (2012) found that LARGE could act as a bifunctional
glycosyltransferase, with both xylosyltransferase and
glucuronyltransferase activities, which produced repeating units of
[-3-xylose-alpha-1,3-glucuronic acid-beta-1-]. This modification allowed
alpha-dystroglycan to bind laminin-G-domain-containing extracellular
matrix ligands.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Mutation in the LARGE gene can cause 2 different forms of muscular
dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy (MDDG): a severe congenital form with brain
and eye anomalies (type A6; MDDGA6, 613154), formerly designated
Walker-Warburg syndrome (WWS) or muscle-eye-brain disease (MEB), and a
less severe congenital form with mental retardation (type B6; MDDGB6;
608840), formerly designated congenital muscular dystrophy type 1D
(MDC1D).

Longman et al. (2003) studied 36 patients with congenital muscular
dystrophy (CMD) and either mental retardation, structural brain changes,
or abnormal alpha-dystroglycan immunolabeling, who were unlinked to any
known CMD loci. Among 29 families in which linkage to the LARGE gene was
not excluded, sequence analysis identified 1 patient who was compound
heterozygous for mutations in the LARGE gene: E509K (603590.0001) and a
1-bp insertion (1999insT; 603590.0002). The affected 17-year-old girl
presented with congenital muscular dystrophy, profound mental
retardation, and white matter changes and subtle structural
abnormalities on brain MRI (MDDGB6; 608840).

In a patient with muscle-eye-brain disease (MDDGA6; 613154), Clement et
al. (2008) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the
LARGE gene (603590.0005 and S331F, 603590.0006). The patient had
congenital muscular dystrophy, increased serum creatine kinase, mental
retardation, and myopia. Brain MRI showed ventricular dilatation,
abnormal white matter changes, cerebellar cysts, dysplastic cerebellar
vermis, posterior concavity of the brainstem, pontine hypoplasia with a
cleft, and frontoparietal polymicrogyria.

In 2 Saudi sibs with Walker-Warburg syndrome (613154), born of
consanguineous parents, van Reeuwijk et al. (2007) identified a
homozygous 63-kb intragenic deletion in the LARGE gene (603590.0003).

In 1 of 81 Italian patients with congenital muscular dystrophy and
defective glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan, Mercuri et al. (2009)
identified a homozygous mutation in the LARGE gene (W495R; 603590.0004).
The phenotype was consistent with Walker-Warburg syndrome.

In a patient with LARGE-related congenital muscular dystrophy, Clement
et al. (2008) identified compound heterozygous mutations in the LARGE
gene (603590.0007 and 603590.0001).

In 2 sisters with LARGE-related congenital muscular dystrophy, Clarke et
al. (2011) identified a homozygous insertion/deletion in the LARGE gene
(603590.0008). Each unaffected parent was heterozygous for the mutation.

EVOLUTION

Sabeti et al. (2007) reported an analysis of over 3 million
polymorphisms from the International HapMap Project Phase 2. The
analysis revealed more than 300 strong candidate regions that appeared
to have undergone recent natural selection. Examination of 22 of the
strongest regions highlighted 3 cases in which 2 genes in a common
biologic process had apparently undergone positive selection in the same
population: LARGE and DMD (300377), both related to infection by the
Lassa virus, in West Africa; SLC24A5 (609802) and SLC45A2 (606202), both
involved in skin pigmentation, in Europe; and EDAR (604095) and EDA2R
(300276), both involved in the development of hair follicles, in Asia.

ANIMAL MODEL

Grewal et al. (2001) found that the mouse myodystrophy (myd) mutation
resides in the mouse homolog of the LARGE gene. They found that an
intragenic deletion of exons 4-7 causes a frameshift in the resultant
mRNA and a premature termination codon before the first of the 2
catalytic domains. On immunoblots, a monoclonal antibody to
alpha-dystroglycan, a component of the dystrophin-associated
glycoprotein complex (DGC), showed reduced binding in myd, which they
attributed to altered glycosylation of this protein. They speculated
that abnormal posttranslational modification of alpha-dystroglycan may
contribute to the myd phenotype.

Michele et al. (2002) demonstrated in both muscle-eye-brain disease and
Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy (see 253800) patients that
alpha-dystroglycan is expressed at the muscle membrane, but similar
hypoglycosylation in the diseases directly abolishes binding activity of
dystroglycan for the ligands laminin (see 150240), neurexin (see
600565), and agrin (103320). Michele et al. (2002) showed that this
posttranslational biochemical and functional disruption of
alpha-dystroglycan is recapitulated in the muscle and central nervous
system of myd mice. Michele et al. (2002) demonstrated that myd mice
have abnormal neuronal migration in the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and
hippocampus, and show disruption of the basal lamina. In addition, myd
mice reveal that dystroglycan targets proteins to functional sites in
brain through its interactions with extracellular matrix proteins.
Michele et al. (2002) suggested that at least 3 mammalian genes function
within a convergent posttranslational processing pathway during the
biosynthesis of dystroglycan and that abnormal dystroglycan-ligand
interactions underlie the pathogenic mechanism of muscular dystrophy
with brain abnormalities.

Holzfeind et al. (2002) showed that the muscular dystrophy phenotype is
not confined to skeletal muscle in the myd (Large-myd) mouse.
Immunohistochemistry indicated disruption of the dystrophin-associated
glycoprotein complex in skeletal and cardiac muscle. Mutant skeletal
muscle showed a general increase in the expression of DGC proteins and
of dysferlin (DYSF; 603009) and caveolin-3 (CAV3; 601253). In contrast,
the expression of DGC proteins was reduced in cardiac muscle. Overlay
assays showed loss of laminin (LAM1; 150320) binding by
alpha-dystroglycan in Large-myd skeletal and cardiac muscle and in
brain. Electroretinograms of homozygous mutant mice showed gross
abnormalities of b-wave characteristics, indicative of a complex defect
in retinal transmission. The laminar architecture of the cortices of the
cerebrum and the cerebellum was disturbed, suggesting defective neuronal
migration.

Glycosyltransferase deficiency is a pathogenic mechanism that has been
identified in several congenital muscular dystrophies and results in
abnormal glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan. In myd mice, Barresi et
al. (2004) found that overexpression of transduced Large ameliorated the
dystrophic phenotype and induced synthesis of glycan-enriched alpha-DG
with high affinity for extracellular ligands. In myoblasts from patients
with Fukuyama muscular dystrophy, muscle-eye-brain disease, and
Walker-Warburg syndrome, overexpression of LARGE resulted in increased
expression of glycosylated alpha-DG and organization of laminin on the
cell surface. The findings suggested that LARGE does not activate the
mutant enzyme in each disorder, but that it is an essential component of
the glycosylation machinery of alpha-DG. Rando (2004) reviewed this
approach to the treatment of muscular dystrophies by enhancing
glycosylation.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY-DYSTROGLYCANOPATHY (CONGENITAL WITH MENTAL RETARDATION),
TYPE B, 6
LARGE, GLU509LYS

In a 17-year-old girl with congenital muscular dystrophy, profound
mental retardation, white matter changes, and subtle brain structural
abnormalities (MDDGB6; 608840), Longman et al. (2003) identified
compound heterozygosity for mutations in the LARGE gene. One mutation
was a 1525G-A transition in exon 13 resulting in a substitution of
lysine for glutamate-509, a highly conserved residue in the putative
second catalytic domain; the other was a 1-bp insertion (1999insT;
603590.0002) in exon 15, predicted to result in a frameshift and
premature stop signal at codon 693, truncating the putative second
catalytic domain. The patient's skeletal muscle biopsy showed reduced
immunolabeling of alpha-dystroglycan. Immunoblotting with an antibody to
a glycosylated epitope demonstrated a reduced molecular weight form of
alpha-dystroglycan that retained some laminin-binding activity.

Brockington et al. (2005) showed that LARGE mutants E509K and 1999insT
had no effect on alpha-dystroglycan glycosylation and failed to localize
correctly to the Golgi apparatus, confirming their pathogenicity.

In a patient with LARGE-related congenital muscular dystrophy and mental
retardation (608840), Clement et al. (2008) identified compound
heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the LARGE gene: E509K and a frameshift
(667fs; 603590.0007). The patient was a 14-year-old individual with had
mental retardation, nystagmus, abnormal electroretinogram, and increased
serum creatine kinase. Brain MRI showed periventricular and temporal
white matter changes, posterior concavity of the brainstem, hypoplastic
pons, and frontoparietal pachygyria. The patient was identified in a
larger study of 27 patients with a dystroglycanopathy.

LARGE, 63-KB DEL

In 2 Saudi sibs with Walker-Warburg syndrome (MDDGA6; 613154), born of
consanguineous parents, van Reeuwijk et al. (2007) identified a
homozygous 63-kb intragenic deletion in the LARGE gene, including part
of intron 8, exon 9, intron 9, exon 10, and most of intron 10. At birth,
both showed severe hypotonia, absent deep tendon reflexes, widened
anterior fontanels, and ophthalmic changes, including cataract, optic
atrophy, and retinal dysplasia. Both had increased serum creatine kinase
and dystrophic muscle biopsies. Brain CT scan showed ventricular
dilatation, absence of the inferior cerebellar vermis, and hypoplastic
cerebellum; 1 of the sibs had hydrocephalus and Dandy-Walker
malformation. The sibs died at age 6 and 2 months, respectively. The
unaffected parents were heterozygous for the deletion.

LARGE, TRP495ARG

In a patient with Walker-Warburg syndrome (MDDGA6; 613154), Mercuri et
al. (2009) identified a homozygous 1483T-C transition in the LARGE gene,
resulting in a trp495-to-arg (W495R) substitution in a highly conserved
residue needed to correct nucleotide-disphosphosugar transferase
activity. The patient had increased serum creatine kinase, absent
alpha-dystroglycan (128239) on muscle biopsy, mental retardation, and
had only achieved head control.

In a patient with muscle-eye-brain disease (MDDGA6; 613154), Clement et

LARGE gene: 1 resulting in a frameshift at gln87, and the other in a
ser331-to-phe substitution (S331F; 603590.0006). The patient had
congenital muscular dystrophy, increased serum creatine kinase, mental
retardation, and myopia. Brain MRI showed ventricular dilatation,
abnormal white matter changes, cerebellar cysts, dysplastic cerebellar
vermis, posterior concavity of the brainstem, pontine hypoplasia with a

LARGE, 42.9-KB INS/4.1-KB DEL

In 2 sisters, born of consanguineous Lebanese parents with congenital
muscular dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy with mental retardation (608840),
Clarke et al. (2011) identified a homozygous 40.8- to 42.9-kb insertion
between exons 10 and 11 of the LARGE gene, predicted to introduce a
premature stop codon in the mRNA transcript, resulting in truncation of
the LARGE protein midway through translation. The insertion was
associated with 3.0- to 4.1-kb deletion of a central region of intron
10, but the exact breakpoints of the deletion/insertion were not found,
suggesting that an even more complex rearrangement may have occurred.
The abnormal insertion sequence mapped to a part of a spliced EST
normally located 100-kb centromeric to the LARGE gene. The girls had
moderate mental retardation, marked cerebellar hypoplasia, dilated
ventricles, and white matter abnormalities; 1 had pachygyria.

;;TUMOR-UPREGULATED CARD-CONTAINING ANTAGONIST OF CASP9; TUCAN;;
CARD INHIBITOR OF NFKB-ACTIVATING LIGANDS; CARDINAL;;
NDPP1;;
KIAA0955
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Caspase recruitment domain (CARD)-containing proteins, such as CARD8,
are involved in pathways leading to activation of caspases or nuclear
factor kappa-B (NFKB; see 164011) in the context of apoptosis or
inflammation, respectively (Bouchier-Hayes et al., 2001).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated human brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1999) cloned CARD8, which they designated
KIAA0955. The transcript contains several repetitive elements in the
3-prime UTR, and the deduced protein contains 431 amino acids. RT-PCR
ELISA detected highest expression of CARD8 in kidney and corpus callosum
and lowest expression in pancreas. All other tissues and specific brain
regions examined showed intermediate expression.

By searching databases for sequences similar to the CARD domain of APAF1
(602233), followed by PCR, Pathan et al. (2001) cloned CARD8, which they
designated TUCAN. CARD8 contains an N-terminal segment that shares 50%
amino acid identity with a region of the proapoptotic protein DEFCAP
(NALP1; 606636), as well as a C-terminal CARD domain.

By Western blot analysis of several tissues, Bouchier-Hayes et al.
(2001) found CARD8 expressed at an apparent molecular mass of 50 kD,
close to the predicted molecular mass of 49 kD. Highest expression was
in lung, ovary, testis, and placenta, with low or absent expression in
brain, skeletal muscle, and spleen.

By RT-PCR, Razmara et al. (2002) found highest CARD8 expression in
placenta, spleen, lymph node, and bone marrow.

By EST analysis, Zhang and Fu (2002) identified 5 splice variants of
CARD8, which they called NDPP1. The variants all have different
translation start sites.

Yamamoto et al. (2005) cloned a splice variant of CARD8 that they named
TUCAN54 after the calculated molecular mass of the encoded protein. The
deduced 487-amino acid TUCAN54 protein has a unique 80-amino acid N
terminus compared with the 48-kD isoform, TUCAN48, but both proteins
contain a NALP homology domain, a candidate caspase cleavage site
(DEED), a C-terminal CARD domain, and several putative phosphorylation
sites. The N terminus of TUCAN54 provides phosphorylation sites not
found in TUCAN48. RT-PCR detected high TUCAN54 expression in leukocytes
and spleen. Expression was lower in heart, lung, thymus, liver,
pancreas, and testis, and little to no expression was detected in other
tissues examined. TUCAN54 was widely expressed in a variety of tumor
cell lines.

By EST database and RT-PCR analyses, Bagnall et al. (2008) characterized
5 isoforms of CARD8 that differ in their N termini and have predicted
molecular masses of 47.5, 48, 51, 54, and 60 kD. The major 48-kD isoform
has 432 amino acids and starts in exon 5, and the 54-kD isoform has 487
amino acids and starts in exon 4. The 47.5-kD isoform differs in the
first 20 amino acids from the 48-kD isoform and results from a putative
initiation codon 20 bp upstream of exon 6. Western blot analysis of
lymphoblastoid cell lines from 6 Crohn disease (see IBD1; 266600)
patients showed a 48- or 47.5-kD band in all cell lines and an
additional band of 54 kD in only 1 cell line.

GENE STRUCTURE

Zhang and Fu (2002) determined that the CARD8 gene contains 14 exons and
spans more than 50 kb. The first 3 exons are noncoding.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Zhang and Fu (2002) mapped the CARD8 gene
to chromosome 19q13.3.

GENE FUNCTION

By overexpression in Jurkat human T cells, Pathan et al. (2001) found
that CARD8 inhibited apoptosis and caspase activation induced by APAF1-
and CASP9 (602234)-dependent stimuli but not APAF1- and
CASP9-independent stimuli. Immunohistochemical analysis detected
elevated CARD8 immunostaining in 42 of 66 (64%) colon cancer specimens
compared with the adjacent normal tissues. Higher endogenous CARD8
immunostaining correlated with shorter patient survival.

Bouchier-Hayes et al. (2001) found that CARD8 suppressed NFKB activation
associated with overexpression of NFKB activators or with ligand-induced
stimulation of IL1 receptor (see 147810) or TNF receptor (see 191190).
Coimmunoprecipitation experiments revealed that CARD8 interacted with
the regulatory subunit of the I-kappa-B kinase complex, IKK-gamma
(IKBKG; 300248). Bouchier-Hayes et al. (2001) concluded that CARD8 is a
regulator of NFKB activation in the context of proinflammatory signals.

Razmara et al. (2002) found that CARD8 mediated apoptosis.
Overexpression of CARD8 induced apoptosis in transfected breast cancer
and green monkey kidney cells. In contrast to the findings of Pathan et
al. (2001), inhibitor studies by Razmara et al. (2002) indicated that
apoptosis was induced by CARD8 via the APAF1/CASP9 apoptotic complex.
CARD8 also suppressed NFKB activation by diverse stimuli, and stable
CARD8 expression sensitized monocytes to differentiation-induced
apoptosis. Razmara et al. (2002) found that CARD8 bound CASP1 (147678)
and negatively regulated CASP1-dependent IL1B secretion in monocytes. In
addition, CARD8 bound the CASP1 inhibitors ICEBERG (605354) and
pseudo-ICE. Razmara et al. (2002) concluded that CARD8 may be an adaptor
molecule that regulates CASP1 activation, NFKB activation, and
apoptosis.

Zhang and Fu (2002) found that expression of CARD8 blocked BAX
(600040)-induced apoptosis in several human cell lines and in rat
embryonic fibroblasts. TNF-alpha-induced NFKB activation was suppressed
in a CARD8-transfected hepatoma cell line.

Agostini et al. (2004) noted that NALP1, unlike other short NALP
proteins, contains a C-terminal CARD domain that interacts with and
activates CASP5 (602665). CASP1 and CASP5 are activated when they
assemble with NALP1 and ASC (PYCARD; 606838) to form the inflammasome,
which is responsible for processing the inactive IL1B (147720) precursor
(proIL1B) to release active IL1B cytokine. Using immunoprecipitation
analysis, Agostini et al. (2004) found that CARD8, which contains
C-terminal FIIND (function to find) and CARD domains, associated with
constructs of NALP2 (609364) and NALP3 (CIAS1; 606416) lacking the
N-terminal pyrin domain and/or the C-terminal leucine-rich repeat
domain. They determined that the interaction was mediated by the FIIND
domain of CARD8 and the centrally located NACHT domain of NALP2 and
NALP3. The pyrin domain of NALP2 and NALP3, like that of NALP1,
interacted with the pyrin domain of ASC, which recruits CASP1.
Transfection experiments showed that an inflammasome could be assembled
containing ASC, CARD8, CASP1, and a short NALP, resulting in activation
of CASP1, but not CASP5, and strong processing of proIL1B.

Yamamoto et al. (2005) found that overexpression of TUCAN54 in human
cell lines inhibited pro-CASP9 activation and suppressed apoptosis
induced by staurosporin, a protein kinase inhibitor, and by etoposide, a
chemotherapeutic reagent. In contrast, suppression of TUCAN54 expression
via small interfering RNA increased etoposide-induced cell death.
TUCAN54 also inhibited CASP8 (601763) activation, thereby suppressing
FAS (TNFRSF6; 134637)-induced cell death. TUCAN48 inhibited CASP9
activation and, more weakly, CASP8 activation, but only TUCAN54
physically associated with FADD (602457). FADD constitutively associated
with pro-CASP8 in transfected cells, suggesting that TUCAN54 inhibits
pro-CASP8 activation by forming a molecular complex with FADD and
pro-CASP8.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Using RNA from lymphoblastoid cell lines of Crohn disease patients,
Bagnall et al. (2008) showed that an A-to-T transversion in exon 5 of
the CARD8 gene (dbSNP rs2043211), predicted to result in a cys10-to-ter
(C10X) substitution in the 48-kD isoform of CARD8, did not affect the
47.5-kD isoform. Patients who were TT homozygous showed somewhat reduced
expression of CARD8 mRNA, but expressed a 47.5-kD protein. The authors
showed that the dbSNP rs2043211 variant had multiple outcomes including
unaffected, cys10 to ter, cys34 to ter, phe52 to ile, and phe102 to ile.
Bagnall et al. (2008) noted that the multiple isoforms and differing
consequences for a predicted stop codon polymorphism underline the
importance of detailed analysis of the effects of proposed functional
variants on gene expression.

Using a genomewide screen of Salmonella typhimurium-infected HapMap
lymphoblastoid cells from individuals of northern and western European
or Nigerian ancestry, Ko et al. (2009) identified a loss-of-function
allele of CARD8 (cys10 to ter; dbSNP rs2043211) that was associated with
increased cell death in vitro. Overexpression of alternative alleles and
RNA interference analysis supported the association. Genotyping of
individuals with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) showed a
modestly increased risk with the variant. Ko et al. (2009) proposed that
loss of CARD8 function and an increased inflammatory response may
protect against Salmonella but lead to increased inflammatory disease.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The KRAS gene encodes the human cellular homolog of a transforming gene
isolated from the Kirsten rat sarcoma virus. The RAS proteins are
GDP/GTP-binding proteins that act as intracellular signal transducers.
The most well-studied members of the RAS (derived from 'RAt Sarcoma'
virus) gene family include KRAS, HRAS (190020), and NRAS (164790). These
genes encode immunologically related proteins with a molecular mass of
21 kD and are homologs of rodent sarcoma virus genes that have
transforming abilities. While these wildtype cellular proteins in humans
play a vital role in normal tissue signaling, including proliferation,
differentiation, and senescence, mutated genes are potent oncogenes that
play a role in many human cancers (Weinberg, 1982; Kranenburg, 2005).

CLONING

Der et al. (1982) identified a new human DNA sequence homologous to the
transforming oncogene of the Kirsten (ras-K) murine sarcoma virus within
mouse 3T3 fibroblast cells transformed by DNA from an undifferentiated
human lung cancer cell line (LX-1). The findings showed that KRAS could
act as an oncogene in human cancer.

Chang et al. (1982) isolated clones corresponding to the human cellular
KRAS gene from human placental and embryonic cDNA libraries. Two
isoforms were identified, designated KRAS1 and KRAS2. KRAS1 contained
0.9 kb homologous to viral Kras and had 1 intervening sequence, and
KRAS2 contained 0.3 kb homologous to viral Kras. McCoy et al. (1983)
characterized the KRAS gene isolated from a human colon adenocarcinoma
cell line (SW840) and determined that it corresponded to KRAS2 as
identified by Chang et al. (1982). The KRAS2 oncogene was amplified in
several tumor cell lines.

McGrath et al. (1983) cloned the KRAS1 and KRAS2 genes and determined
that the KRAS1 gene is a pseudogene. The KRAS2 gene encodes a
188-residue protein with a molecular mass of 21.66 kD. It showed only 6
amino acid differences from the viral gene. Comparison of the 2 KRAS
genes showed that KRAS1 is lacking several intervening sequences,
consistent with it being a pseudogene derived from a processed KRAS2
mRNA. The major KRAS2 mRNA transcript is 5.5 kb. Alternative splicing
results in 2 variants, isoforms A and B, that differ in the C-terminal
region.

Alternative splicing of exon 5 results in the KRASA and KRASB isoforms.
Exon 6 contains the C-terminal region in KRASB, whereas it encodes the
3-prime untranslated region in KRASA. The differing C-terminal regions
of these isoforms are subjected to posttranslational modifications. The
differential posttranslational processing has profound functional
effects leading to alternative trafficking pathways and protein
localization (Carta et al., 2006).

GENE STRUCTURE

McGrath et al. (1983) first reported that the KRAS2 gene spans 38 kb and
contains 4 exons. Detailed sequence analysis showed that exon 4 has 2
forms, which the authors designated 4A and 4B.

The KRAS2 gene has been shown to have a total of 6 exons. Exons 2, 3,
and 4 are invariant coding exons, whereas exon 5 undergoes alternative
splicing. KRASB results from exon 5 skipping. In KRASA mRNA, exon 6
encodes the 3-prime untranslated region. In KRASB mRNA, exon 6 encodes
the C-terminal region (Carta et al., 2006).

MAPPING

By in situ hybridization, Popescu et al. (1985) mapped the KRAS2 gene to
chromosome 12p12.1-p11.1. By linkage with RFLPs, O'Connell et al. (1985)
confirmed the approximate location of KRAS2 on 12p12.1.

- Pseudogene

The KRAS1 gene is a KRAS2 pseudogene and has been assigned to chromosome
6 (O'Brien et al., 1983; McBride et al., 1983). By in situ
hybridization, Popescu et al. (1985) assigned the KRAS1 gene to
6p12-p11. Because KRAS1 was found to be a pseudogene, its official
symbol was changed to KRAS1P.

GENE FUNCTION

Johnson et al. (2005) found that the 3 human RAS genes, HRAS, KRAS, and
NRAS, contain multiple let-7 (605386) complementary sites in their
3-prime UTRs that allow let-7 miRNA to regulate their expression. Let-7
expression was lower in lung tumors than in normal lung tissue, whereas
expression of the RAS proteins was significantly higher in lung tumors,
suggesting a possible mechanism for let-7 in cancer.

Bivona et al. (2006) found that the subcellular localization and
function of Kras in mammalian cells was modulated by Pkc (see 176960).
Phosphorylation of Kras by Pkc agonists induced rapid translocation of
Kras from the plasma membrane to several intracellular membranes,
including the outer mitochondrial membrane, where Kras associated with
Bclxl (BCL2L1; 600039). Phosphorylated Kras required Bclxl for induction
of apoptosis.

Yeung et al. (2006) devised genetically encoded probes to assess surface
potential in intact cells. These probes revealed marked, localized
alterations in the change of the inner surface of the plasma membrane of
macrophages during the course of phagocytosis. Hydrolysis of
phosphoinositides and displacement of phosphatidylserine accounted for
the change in surface potential at the phagosomal cup. Signaling
molecules such as KRAS, RAC1 (602048), and c-SRC (190090) that are
targeted to the membrane by electrostatic interactions were rapidly
released from membrane subdomains where the surface charge was altered
by lipid remodeling during phagocytosis.

Heo et al. (2006) surveyed plasma membrane targeting mechanisms by
imaging the subcellular localization of 125 fluorescent
protein-conjugated Ras, Rab, Arf, and Rho proteins. Of 48 proteins that
were localized to the plasma membrane, 37 contained clusters of
positively charged amino acids. To test whether these polybasic clusters
bind negatively charged phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate lipids,
Heo et al. (2006) developed a chemical phosphatase activation method to
deplete plasma membrane phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate.
Unexpectedly, proteins with polybasic clusters dissociated from the
plasma membrane only when both phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and
phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate were depleted, arguing that
both lipid second messengers jointly regulate plasma membrane targeting.

Gazin et al. (2007) performed a genomewide RNA interference (RNAi)
screen in KRAS-transformed NIH 3T3 cells and identified 28 genes
required for RAS-mediated epigenetic silencing of the proapoptotic FAS
gene (TNFRSF6; 134637). At least 9 of these RAS epigenetic silencing
effectors (RESEs), including the DNA methyltransferase DNMT1 (126375),
were directly associated with specific regions of the FAS promoter in
KRAS-transformed NIH 3T3 cells but not in untransformed NIH 3T3 cells.
RNAi-mediated knockdown of any of the 28 RESEs resulted in failure to
recruit DNMT1 to the FAS promoter, loss of FAS promoter
hypermethylation, and derepression of FAS expression. Analysis of 5
other epigenetically repressed genes indicated that RAS directs the
silencing of multiple unrelated genes through a largely common pathway.
Finally, Gazin et al. (2007) showed that 9 RESEs are required for
anchorage-independent growth and tumorigenicity of KRAS-transformed NIH
3T3 cells; these 9 genes had not previously been implicated in
transformation by RAS. Gazin et al. (2007) concluded that RAS-mediated
epigenetic silencing occurs through a specific, complex pathway
involving components that are required for maintenance of a fully
transformed phenotype.

Haigis et al. (2008) used genetically engineered mice to determine
whether and how the related oncogenes Kras and Nras (164790) regulate
homeostasis and tumorigenesis in the colon. Expression of Kras(G12D) in
the colonic epithelium stimulated hyperproliferation in a Mek (see
176872)-dependent manner. Nras(G12D) did not alter the growth properties
of the epithelium, but was able to confer resistance to apoptosis. In
the context of an Apc (611731)-mutant colonic tumor, activation of Kras
led to defects in terminal differentiation and expansion of putative
stem cells within the tumor epithelium. This Kras tumor phenotype was
associated with attenuated signaling through the MAPK pathway, and human
colon cancer cells expressing mutant Kras were hypersensitive to
inhibition of Raf (see 164760) but not Mek. Haigis et al. (2008)
concluded that their studies demonstrated clear phenotypic differences
between mutant Kras and Nras, and suggested that the oncogenic phenotype
of mutant Kras might be mediated by noncanonical signaling through Ras
effector pathways.

By studying the transcriptomes of paired colorectal cancer cell lines
that differed only in the mutational status of their KRAS or BRAF
(164757) genes, Yun et al. (2009) found that GLUT1 (138140), encoding
glucose transporter-1, was 1 of 3 genes consistently upregulated in
cells with KRAS or BRAF mutations. The mutant cells exhibited enhanced
glucose uptake and glycolysis and survived in low-glucose conditions,
phenotypes that all required GLUT1 expression. In contrast, when cells
with wildtype KRAS alleles were subjected to a low-glucose environment,
very few cells survived. Most surviving cells expressed high levels of
GLUT1, and 4% of these survivors had acquired KRAS mutations not present
in their parents. The glycolysis inhibitor 3-bromopyruvate
preferentially suppressed the growth of cells with KRAS or BRAF
mutations. Yun et al. (2009) concluded that, taken together, these data
suggested that glucose deprivation can drive the acquisition of KRAS
pathway mutations in human tumors.

Meylan et al. (2009) showed that the NF-kappa-B (see 164011) pathway is
required for the development of tumors in a mouse model of lung
adenocarcinoma. Concomitant loss of p53 (191170) and expression of
oncogenic Kras containing the G12D mutation resulted in NF-kappa-B
activation in primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Conversely, in lung
tumor cell lines expressing Kras(G12D) and lacking p53, p53 restoration
led to NF-kappa-B inhibition. Furthermore, the inhibition of NF-kappa-B
signaling induced apoptosis in p53-null lung cancer cell lines.
Inhibition of the pathway in lung tumors in vivo, from the time of tumor
initiation or after tumor progression, resulted in significantly reduced
tumor development. Meylan et al. (2009) concluded that, together, their
results indicated a critical function for NF-kappa-B signaling in lung
tumor development and, further, that this requirement depends on p53
status.

Barbie et al. (2009) used systematic RNA interference to detect
synthetic lethal partners of oncogenic KRAS and found that the
noncanonical I-kappa-B kinase TBK1 (604834) was selectively essential in
cells that contain mutant KRAS. Suppression of TBK1 induced apoptosis
specifically in human cancer cell lines that depend on oncogenic KRAS
expression. In these cells, TBK1 activated NF-kappa-B antiapoptotic
signals involving c-REL (164910) and BCLXL (BCL2L1; 600039) that were
essential for survival, providing mechanistic insights into this
synthetic lethal interaction. Barbie et al. (2009) concluded that TBK1
and NF-kappa-B signaling are essential in KRAS mutant tumors, and
establish a general approach for the rational identification of
codependent pathways in cancer.

In Drosophila eye-antennal discs, cooperation between Ras(V12), an
oncogenic form of the Ras85D protein, and loss-of-function mutations in
the conserved tumor suppressor 'scribble' (607733) gives rise to
metastatic tumors that display many characteristics observed in human
cancers (summary by Wu et al., 2010). Wu et al. (2010) showed that
clones of cells bearing different mutations can cooperate to promote
tumor growth and invasion in Drosophila. The authors found that the
Ras(V12) and scrib-null mutations can also cause tumors when they affect
different adjacent epithelial cells. Wu et al. (2010) showed that this
interaction between Ras(V12) and scrib-null clones involves JNK
signaling propagation and JNK-induced upregulation of
JAK/STAT-activating cytokines (see 604260), a compensatory growth
mechanism for tissue homeostasis. The development of Ras(V12) tumors can
also be triggered by tissue damage, a stress condition that activates
JNK signaling. The authors suggested that similar cooperative mechanisms
could have a role in the development of human cancers.

Correct localization and signaling by farnesylated KRAS is regulated by
the prenyl-binding protein PDE-delta (PDED; 602676), which sustains the
spatial organization of KRAS by facilitating its diffusion in the
cytoplasm (Chandra et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2004). Zimmerman et al.
(2013) reported that interfering with the binding of mammalian PDED to
KRAS by means of small molecules provided a novel opportunity to
suppress oncogenic RAS signaling by altering its localization to
endomembranes. Biochemical screening and subsequent structure-based hit
optimization yielded inhibitors of the KRAS-PDED interaction that
selectively bound to the prenyl-binding pocket of PDED with nanomolar
affinity, inhibited oncogenic RAS signaling, and suppressed in vitro and
in vivo proliferation of human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells
that are dependent on oncogenic KRAS.

- Regulation of KRAS Expression by KRAS1P Transcript Levels

Following their finding that PTENP1 (613531), a pseudogene of the PTEN
(601728) tumor suppressor gene, can derepress PTEN by acting as a decoy
for PTEN-targeting miRNAS, Poliseno et al. (2010) extended their
analysis to the oncogene KRAS and its pseudogene KRAS1. KRAS1P 3-prime
UTR overexpression in DU145 prostate cancer cells resulted in increased
KRAS mRNA abundance and accelerated cell growth. They also found that
KRAS and KRAS1P transcript levels were positively correlated in prostate
cancer. Notably, the KRAS1P locus 6p12-p11 is amplified in different
human tumors, including neuroblastoma, retinoblastoma, and
hepatocellular carcinoma. Poliseno et al. (2010) concluded that their
findings together pointed to a putative protooncogenic role for KRAS1P,
and supported the notion that pseudogene functions mirror the functions
of their cognate genes as explained by a miRNA decoy mechanism.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Role in Solid Tumors

KRAS is said to be one of the most activated oncogenes, with 17 to 25%
of all human tumors harboring an activating KRAS mutation (Kranenburg,
2005). Critical regions of the KRAS gene for oncogenic activation
include codons 12, 13, 59, 61, and 63 (Grimmond et al., 1992). These
activating mutations cause Ras to accumulate in the active GTP-bound
state by impairing intrinsic GTPase activity and conferring resistance
to GTPase activating proteins (Zenker et al., 2007).

In a study of 96 human tumors or tumor cell lines in the NIH 3T3
transforming system, Pulciani et al. (1982) found a mutated HRAS locus
only in a single cancer cell line, whereas transforming KRAS genes were
identified in 8 different carcinomas and sarcomas. KRAS appeared to be
involved in malignancy much more often than HRAS. In a serous
cystadenocarcinoma of the ovary (167000), Feig et al. (1984) showed the
presence of an activated KRAS oncogene that was not activated in normal
cells of the same patient. The transforming gene product displayed an
electrophoretic mobility pattern that differed from that of KRAS
transforming proteins in other tumors, suggesting a novel somatic KRAS
mutation in this tumor.

In a cell line of human lung cancer (211980), Nakano et al. (1984)
identified a mutation in the KRAS2 gene (190070.0001), resulting in gene
activation with transforming ability of the mutant protein.

Rodenhuis et al. (1987) used a novel, highly sensitive assay based on
oligonucleotide hybridization following in vitro amplification to
examine DNA from 39 lung tumor specimens. The KRAS gene was found to be
activated by point mutations in codon 12 in 5 of 10 adenocarcinomas. Two
of these tumors were less than 2 cm in size and had not metastasized. No
HRAS, KRAS, or NRAS mutations were observed in 15 squamous cell
carcinomas, 10 large cell carcinomas, 1 carcinoid tumor, 2 metastatic
adenocarcinomas from primary tumors outside the lung, and 1 small cell
carcinoma. An approximately 20-fold amplification of the unmutated KRAS
gene was observed in a tumor that proved to be a solitary lung
metastasis of a rectal carcinoma.

Yanez et al. (1987) found mutations in codon 12 of the KRAS gene in 4 of
16 colon cancers (114500), 2 of 27 lung cancers, and 1 of 8 breast
cancers (114480); no mutations were found at codon position 61.

The highest observed frequency of KRAS2 point mutations occurs in
pancreatic carcinomas (260350), with 90% of the patients having at least
1 KRAS2 mutation (Almoguera et al., 1988; Smit et al., 1988). Most of
these mutations are in codon 12 (see, e.g., G12D, 190070.0005 and G12V,
190070.0006) (Hruban et al., 1993).

Burmer and Loeb (1989) identified KRAS2 mutations in both diploid and
aneuploid cells in colon adenomas and carcinomas. Twenty-six of 40 colon
carcinomas contained mutations at codon 12, and 9 of the 12 adenomas
studied contained similar mutations.

Sidransky et al. (1992) found that KRAS mutations were detectable in DNA
purified from stool in 8 of 9 patients with colorectal tumors that
contained KRAS mutations. Takeda et al. (1993) used a
mutant-allele-specific amplification (MASA) method to detect KRAS
mutations in cells obtained from the sputum of patients with lung
cancer. A mutation was found in 1 of 5 patients studied. The authors
suggested that the MASA system could be applied to an examination of
metastatic lung carcinomas, particularly from adenocarcinomas of the
colon and pancreas in which KRAS mutations are frequently detected, and
to mass screening for colorectal tumors, using DNA isolated from feces
as a template.

Lee et al. (1995) identified mutations in codon 12 of the KRAS gene in
11 (7.9%) of 140 gastric cancers (137215). Seven cases had a G12S
mutation (190070.0007) and 2 had a G12D mutation (190070.0005). Tumors
located in the upper third of the stomach had a significantly higher
frequency of KRAS codon 12 mutations (3 of 8; 37.5%) compared with
tumors located in the middle (4 of 29; 13.8%) or lower (3 of 99; 3%)
thirds of the stomach (P = 0.001). Among 8 patients with stomach cancer
located in the upper part of the stomach, death occurred in 4 of 5
patients with tumors without KRAS gene mutations, but in none of the 3
patients with KRAS gene-mutated tumors.

Otori et al. (1997) examined tissue sections from 19 hyperplastic
colorectal polyps for mutations in exons 12 and 13 of the KRAS gene.
KRAS mutations were detected in 9 (47%) of 19 polyps, suggesting that
some hyperplastic colorectal polyps may be true premalignant lesions.

KRAS activation has been recognized in microdissected foci of pancreatic
intraepithelial neoplasia (Cubilla and Fitzgerald, 1976; Hruban et al.,
2000; Hruban et al., 2000), the candidate precursor lesion of pancreatic
cancer previously known as ductal cell hyperplasia. Laghi et al. (2002)
found that KRAS codon 12 was mutated in 34 of 41 (83%) pancreatic
cancers and in 11 of 13 (85%) biliary cancers. Multiple distinct KRAS
mutations were found in 16 pancreatic cancers and in 8 biliary cancers.
Multiple KRAS mutations were more frequent in cancers with detectable
pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia than in those without, and
individual precursor lesions of the same neoplastic pancreas harbored
distinct mutations. The results indicated that clonally distinct
precursor lesions of pancreatic cancer may variably contribute to tumor
development.

Nikiforova et al. (2003) analyzed a series of 88 conventional follicular
(188470) and Hurthle cell (607464) thyroid tumors for HRAS, NRAS, or
KRAS mutations and PAX8 (167415)-PPARG (601487) rearrangements.
Forty-nine percent of conventional follicular carcinomas had RAS
mutations, 36% had PAX8-PPARG rearrangement, and only 1 (3%) had both.
Of follicular adenomas, 48% had RAS mutations, 4% had PAX8-PPARG
rearrangement, and 48% had neither. Hurthle cell tumors infrequently had
PAX8-PPARG rearrangement or RAS mutations.

Rajagopalan et al. (2002) systematically evaluated mutations in the BRAF
(164757) and KRAS genes in 330 colorectal tumors. There were 32
mutations in BRAF and 169 mutations in KRAS; no tumor exhibited
mutations in both BRAF and KRAS. Rajagopalan et al. (2002) concluded
that BRAF and KRAS mutations are equivalent in their tumorigenic effects
and are mutated at a similar phase of tumorigenesis, after initiation
but before malignant conversion. Kim et al. (2003) found 7 KRAS missense
mutations in 66 gastric cancers and 16 gastric cancer cell lines. No
BRAF mutations were found.

Oliveira et al. (2004) investigated KRAS in 158 hereditary nonpolyposis
colorectal cancer (HNPCC2; 609310) tumors from patients with germline
MLH1 (120436), MSH2 (609309) or MSH6 (600678) mutations, 166
microsatellite-unstable (MSI-H), and 688 microsatellite-stable (MSS)
sporadic carcinomas. All tumors were characterized for MSI and 81 of 166
sporadic MSI-H colorectal cancers were analyzed for MLH1 promoter
hypermethylation. KRAS mutations were observed in 40% of HNPCC tumors,
and the mutation frequency varied upon the mismatch repair gene
affected: 48% (29/61) in MSH2, 32% (29/91) in MLH1, and 83% (5/6) in
MSH6 (P = 0.01). KRAS mutation frequency was different between HNPCC,
MSS, and MSI-H colorectal cancers (P = 0.002), and MSI-H with MLH1
hypermethylation (P = 0.005). Furthermore, HNPCC colorectal cancers had
more G13D (190070.0003) mutations than MSS (P less than 0.0001), MSI-H
(P = 0.02) or MSI-H tumors with MLH1 hypermethylation (P = 0.03). HNPCC
colorectal and sporadic MSI-H tumors without MLH1 hypermethylation
shared similar KRAS mutation frequency, in particular G13D. The authors
concluded that depending on the genetic/epigenetic mechanism leading to
MSI-H, the outcome in terms of oncogenic activation may be different,
reinforcing the idea that HNPCC, sporadic MSI-H (depending on the MLH1
status) and MSS colorectal cancers may target distinct kinases within
the RAS/RAF/MAPK pathway.

Sommerer et al. (2005) analyzed the KRAS gene in 30 seminomas and 32
nonseminomatous GCTs (see 273300) with a mixture of embryonal carcinoma,
yolk sac tumor, choriocarcinoma, and mature teratoma. KRAS mutations,
all involving codon 12, were identified in 2 (7%) of 30 seminomas and 3
(9%) of 32 nonseminomas.

Groesser et al. (2012) identified somatic mutations in the KRAS gene
(G12D, 190070.0005 and G12V, 190070.0006) in 3 (5%) of 65 nevus
sebaceous tumors (see 162900). The G12D mutation was also found in
somatic mosaic state in a patient with Schimmelpenning-Feuerstein-Mims
syndrome (163200). The authors postulated that the mosaic mutation
likely extends to extracutaneous tissues in the latter disorder, which
could explain the phenotypic pleiotropy.

- Hematologic Malignancies

The myelodysplastic syndrome is a preleukemic hematologic disorder
characterized by low blood counts, bone marrow cells of abnormal
appearance, and progression to acute leukemia in as many as 30% of
patients. Liu et al. (1987) identified a transforming allele in the KRAS
gene in 2 of 4 patients with preleukemia and in 1 who progressed to
acute leukemia from myelodysplastic syndrome. In 1 preleukemic patient,
they detected a novel mutation in codon 13 of KRAS in bone marrow cells
harvested 1.5 years before the acute leukemia developed. The findings
provided evidence that RAS mutations may be involved in the early stages
of human leukemia.

In the bone marrow of a 4-year-old child with acute myeloid leukemia
(AML; 601626), Bollag et al. (1996) identified an in-frame 3-bp
insertion in the KRAS gene (190070.0008).

Bezieau et al. (2001) used ARMS (allele-specific amplification method)
to evaluate the incidence of NRAS- and KRAS2-activating mutations in
patients with multiple myeloma (254500) and related disorders. Mutations
were more frequent in KRAS2 than in NRAS. The authors concluded that
early mutations in these 2 oncogenes may play a major role in the
oncogenesis of multiple myeloma and primary plasma cell leukemia.

The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network (2013) analyzed the genomes of
200 clinically annotated adult cases of de novo AML, using either
whole-genome sequencing (50 cases) or whole-exome sequencing (150
cases), along with RNA and microRNA sequencing and DNA methylation
analysis. The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network (2013) identified
recurrent mutations in the NRAS (164790) or KRAS genes in 23/200 (12%)
samples.

- Cardiofaciocutaneous Syndrome, Noonan Syndrome 3, and Costello
Syndrome

Cardiofaciocutaneous (CFC) syndrome (see 115150) is characterized by
distinctive facial appearance, heart defects, and mental retardation.
CFC shows phenotypic overlap with Noonan syndrome (see 163950) and
Costello syndrome (218040). Approximately 40% of individuals with
clinically diagnosed Noonan syndrome have gain-of-function mutations in
protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 (PTPN11; 176876). Aoki et al. (2005)
identified mutations in the HRAS gene in 12 of 13 individuals with
Costello syndrome, suggesting that the activation of the RAS-MAPK
pathway is the common underlying mechanism of Noonan syndrome, Costello
syndrome, and possibly CFC syndrome. In 2 of 43 unrelated individuals
with CFC syndrome (CFC2; 615278), Niihori et al. (2006) identified 2
different heterozygous KRAS mutations, G60R (190070.0009) and D153V
(190070.0010). Neither mutation had been previously identified in
individuals with cancer. In the same study, Niihori et al. (2006) found
8 different mutations in the BRAF gene (164757), an isoform in the RAF
protooncogene family, in 16 of 40 individuals with CFC syndrome.

Schubbert et al. (2006) identified 3 de novo germline KRAS mutations
(190070.0010-190070.0012) in 5 individuals with Noonan syndrome 3 (NS3;
609942).

In 2 individuals exhibiting a severe Noonan syndrome-3 phenotype with
features overlapping those of CFC and Costello syndromes, Carta et al.
(2006) identified 2 different heterozygous KRAS mutations (190070.0014
and 190070.0015). Both mutations were de novo and affected exon 6, which
encodes the C-terminal portion of KRAS isoform B but does not contribute
to KRAS isoform A. Structural analysis indicated that both substitutions
perturb the conformation of the guanine ring-binding pocket of the
protein, predicting an increase in the guanine diphosphate/guanine
triphosphate (GTP) dissociation rate that would favor GTP binding to the
KRASB isoform and bypass the requirement for a guanine nucleotide
exchange factor.

Zenker et al. (2007) identified 11 different germline mutations in the
KRAS gene, including 8 novel mutations, in a total of 12 patients with a
clinical diagnosis of CFC (2), Noonan syndrome-3 (7), CFC/Noonan
syndrome overlap (1), or Costello syndrome (2). All patients showed mild
to moderate mental retardation. The 2 unrelated infants with Costello
syndrome had 2 different heterozygous mutations
(190070.0017-190070.0018). Both patients had coarse facies, loose and
redundant skin with deep palmar creases, heart defects, failure to
thrive, and moderate mental retardation. Zenker et al. (2007) noted that
these patients may later develop features of CFC syndrome, but
emphasized that the findings underscored the central role of Ras in the
pathogenesis of these diverse but phenotypically related disorders.

In a 20-year-old woman with clinical features typical of Costello
syndrome and additional findings seen in Noonan syndrome, who was
negative for mutations in the PTPN11 and HRAS genes, Bertola et al.
(2007) identified a mutation in the KRAS gene (K5E; 190070.0019). The
authors noted that this mutation was in the same codon as that of 1 of
the patients reported by Zenker et al. (2007) (K5N; 190070.0017).

Schulz et al. (2008) identified mutations in the KRAS gene in 3 (5.9%)
of 51 CFC patients.

- Development of Resistance to Chemotherapeutic Agents

Misale et al. (2012) showed that molecular alterations (in most
instances point mutations) of KRAS are causally associated with the
onset of acquired resistance to anti-EGFR (131550) treatment in
colorectal cancers. Expression of mutant KRAS under the control of its
endogenous gene promoter was sufficient to confer cetuximab resistance,
but resistant cells remained sensitive to combinatorial inhibition of
EGFR and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK). Analysis of
metastases from patients who developed resistance to cetuximab or
panitumumab showed the emergence of KRAS amplification in one sample and
acquisition of secondary KRAS mutations in 60% (6 out of 10) of the
cases. KRAS mutant alleles were detectable in the blood of
cetuximab-treated patients as early as 10 months before radiographic
documentation of disease progression. Misale et al. (2012) concluded
that their results identified KRAS mutations as frequent drivers of
acquired resistance to cetuximab in colorectal cancers, indicated that
the emergence of KRAS mutant clones can be detected noninvasively months
before radiographic progression, and suggested early initiation of a MEK
inhibitor as a rational strategy for delaying or reversing drug
resistance.

Diaz et al. (2012) determined whether mutant KRAS DNA could be detected
in the circulation of 28 patients receiving monotherapy with
panitumumab, a therapeutic anti-EGFR antibody. They found that 9 out of
24 (38%) patients whose tumors were initially KRAS wildtype developed
detectable mutations in KRAS in their sera, 3 of which developed
multiple different KRAS mutations. The appearance of these mutations was
very consistent, generally occurring between 5 and 6 months following
treatment. Mathematical modeling indicated that the mutations were
present in expanded subclones before the initiation of panitumumab
treatment. Diaz et al. (2012) suggested that the emergence of KRAS
mutations is a mediator of acquired resistance to EGFR blockade and that
these mutations can be detected in a noninvasive manner. The results
also explained why solid tumors develop resistance to targeted therapies
in a highly reproducible fashion.

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

Andreyev et al. (1997) used PCR amplification and DNA sequencing to
investigate KRAS exon 1 mutations (codons 12 and 13) in histologic
sections of colorectal adenocarcinomas. They examined samples from 98
patients with Dukes stage A or B fully resected colorectal cancers.
Fourteen of these patients had subsequently relapsed. The presence of a
KRAS mutation was not associated with tumor stage or histologic grade;
neither was there any association with those patients who relapsed. The
authors concluded that detection of KRAS mutation in early colorectal
adenocarcinomas was of no prognostic value.

Porta et al. (1999) found that serum concentrations of organochlorine
compounds were significantly higher in patients with exocrine pancreatic
cancer with a codon 12 KRAS2 mutation compared to cases without a
mutation, with an odds ratio of 8.7 for one organochlorine and 5.3 for
another organochlorine. These estimates held after adjusting for total
lipids, other covariates, and total polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). A
specific association was observed between the G12V (190070.0006)
mutation and both organochlorine concentrations, with an odds ratio of
15.9 and 24.1 for each of the compounds. A similar pattern was shown for
the major diorthochlorinated PCBs.

Vasko et al. (2003) performed a pooled analysis of 269 mutations in
HRAS, KRAS, and NRAS garnered from 39 previous studies of thyroid
tumors. Mutations in codon 61 of NRAS were significantly more frequent
in follicular tumors (19%) than in papillary tumors (188550) (5%) and
significantly more frequent in malignant (25%) than in benign (14%)
tumors. HRAS mutations in codons 12/13 were found in 2 to 3% of all
types of tumors, but HRAS mutations in codon 61 were observed in only
1.4% of tumors, and almost all of them were malignant. KRAS mutations in
exon 1 were found more often in papillary than follicular cancers (2.7%
vs 1.6%) and were sometimes correlated with special epidemiologic
circumstances. The second part of the study by Vasko et al. (2003)
involved analysis of 80 follicular tumors from patients living in
Marseille (France) and Kiev (Ukraine). HRAS mutations in codons 12/13
were found in 12.5% of common adenomas and in 1 follicular carcinoma
(2.9%). Mutations in codon 61 of NRAS occurred in 23.3% and 17.6% of
atypical adenomas and follicular carcinomas, respectively.

POPULATION GENETICS

Although several studies confirmed that approximately 40% of primary
colorectal adenocarcinomas in humans contain a mutated form of the KRAS2
gene, the patterns of mutation at codons 12, 13, and 61 are not the same
in different populations. Hayashi et al. (1996) used the MASA method to
analyze the frequency and type of point mutations in these 3 codons in
319 colorectal cancer tissues collected from patients in Japan. They
then compared these results with those from other sources to examine
whether different geographic locations and environmental influences
might impose distinct patterns on the spectrum of KRAS mutations.
Comparing findings in the U.S., France, and Yugoslavia with those in
Japan, a number of significant differences were found. A possible
explanation put forth by Hayashi et al. (1996) was that an environmental
carcinogen prevailing in a geographic region combines with the
susceptibility of a particular tissue to dictate which type of DNA
lesion will predominate. The predominance of G-to-A mutations among
American and Japanese colorectal cancer patients could be attributable
to alkylating agents or to the absence of direct interaction with any
carcinogens. The prevalence of G-to-T mutations among Yugoslav and
French patients might be ascribed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
and heterocyclic amines.

ANIMAL MODEL

Muller et al. (1983) found transcription of KRAS and the McDonough
strain of feline sarcoma virus (FMS) gene (see 164770) during mouse
development. Furthermore, the differences in transcription in different
tissues suggested a specific role for each: FMS was expressed in
extraembryonic structures or in transport in these tissues, whereas KRAS
was expressed ubiquitously.

Holland et al. (2000) transferred, in a tissue-specific manner, genes
encoding activated forms of Ras and Akt (164730) to astrocytes and
neural progenitors in mice. Although neither activated Ras nor Akt alone
was sufficient to induce glioblastoma multiforme (GBM; 137800)
formation, the combination of activated Ras and Akt induced high-grade
gliomas with the histologic features of human GBMs. These tumors
appeared to arise after gene transfer to neural progenitors, but not
after transfer to differentiated astrocytes. Increased activity of RAS
is found in many human GBMs, and Holland et al. (2000) demonstrated that
AKT activity is increased in most of these tumors, implying that
combined activation of these 2 pathways accurately models the biology of
this disease.

Johnson et al. (2001) used a variation of 'hit-and-run' gene targeting
to create mouse strains carrying oncogenic alleles of Kras capable of
activation only on a spontaneous recombination event in the whole
animal. They demonstrated that mice carrying these mutations were highly
predisposed to a range of tumor types, predominantly early-onset lung
cancer. This model was further characterized by examining the effects of
germline mutations in the p53 gene (191170), which is known to be
mutated along with KRAS in human tumors. Johnson et al. (2001) concluded
that their approach had several advantages over traditional transgenic
strategies, including that it more closely recapitulates spontaneous
oncogene activation as seen in human cancers.

Zhang et al. (2001) presented evidence of a tumor suppressor role of
wildtype KRAS2 in lung tumorigenesis. They found that heterozygous
Kras2-deficient mice were highly susceptible to the chemical induction
of lung tumors compared to wildtype mice. Activating Kras2 mutations
were detected in all chemically induced lung tumors obtained from both
wildtype and heterozygous Kras2-deficient mice. Furthermore, wildtype
Kras2 inhibited colony formation and tumor development by transformed
NIH/3T3 cells. Allelic loss of wildtype Kras2 was found in 67 to 100% of
chemically induced mouse lung adenocarcinomas that harbored a mutant
Kras2 allele. These and other data strongly suggested that wildtype
Kras2 has tumor suppressor activity and is frequently lost during lung
tumor progression. Pfeifer (2001) commented on these findings as
representing 'a new verdict for an old convict.' He quoted evidence that
the HRAS1 gene may also function as a tumor suppressor. Pfeifer (2001)
noted an interesting parallel to the p53 tumor suppressor, which was
initially described as an oncogene, carrying point mutations in tumors.
Later it was discovered that it is, in fact, the wildtype copy of the
gene that functions as a tumor suppressor gene and is capable of
reducing cell proliferation.

Costa et al. (2002) crossed Nf1 (613113) heterozygote mice with mice
heterozygous for a null mutation in the Kras gene. Double heterozygotes
with decreased Ras function had improved learning relative to Nf1
heterozygote mice. Costa et al. (2002) also showed that the Nf1 +/- mice
have increased GABA-mediated inhibition and specific deficits in
long-term potentiation, both of which can be reversed by decreasing Ras
function. Costa et al. (2002) concluded that learning deficits
associated with Nf1 may be caused by excessive Ras activity, which leads
to impairments in long-term potentiation caused by increased
GABA-mediated inhibition.

An S17N substitution in any of the RAS proteins produces
dominant-inhibitory proteins with higher affinities for exchange factors
than normal RAS. These mutants cannot interact with downstream effectors
and therefore form unproductive complexes, preventing activation of
endogenous RAS. Using experiments in COS-7 cells, mouse fibroblasts, and
canine kidney cells, Matallanas et al. (2003) found that the Hras, Kras,
and Nras S17N mutants exhibited distinct inhibitory effects that
appeared to be due largely to their specific membrane localizations. The
authors demonstrated that Hras is present in caveolae, lipid rafts, and
bulk disordered membranes, whereas Kras and Nras are present primarily
in disordered membranes and lipid rafts, respectively. Thus, the Hras
S17N mutant inhibited activation of all 3 wildtype RAS isoforms, the
Kras S17N mutant inhibited wildtype Kras and the portion of Hras in
disordered membranes, and the Nras S17N mutant inhibited wildtype Nras
and the portion of Hras in lipid rafts.

By delivering a recombinant adenoviral vector expressing Cre recombinase
to the bursal cavity that encloses the ovary, Dinulescu et al. (2005)
expressed an oncogenic Kras allele within the ovarian surface epithelium
and observed benign epithelial lesions with a typical endometrioid
glandular morphology that did not progress to ovarian carcinoma
(167000); 7 of 15 mice (47%) also developed peritoneal endometriosis
(131200). When the Kras mutation was combined with conditional deletion
of Pten (601728), all mice developed invasive endometrioid ovarian
adenocarcinomas. Dinulescu et al. (2005) stated that these were the
first mouse models of endometriosis and endometrioid adenocarcinoma of
the ovary.

Collado et al. (2005) used a mouse model for cancer initiation in
humans: the animals had a conditional oncogenic K-rasV12 (190070.0006)
allele that is activated only by the enzyme Cre recombinase, causing
them to develop multiple lung adenomas (premalignant tumors) and a few
lung adenocarcinomas (malignant tumors). Senescence markers previously
identified in cultured cells were used to detect oncogene-induced
senescence in lung sections from control mice (expressing Cre) and from
K-rasV12-expressing mice (expressing Cre and activated K-rasV12).
Collado et al. (2005) analyzed p16(INK4a) (600160), an effector of in
vitro oncogene-induced senescence, and de novo markers that were
identified by using DNA microarray analysis of in vitro oncogene-induced
senescence. These de novo markers are p15(INK4b), also known as CDKN2B
(600431), DEC1 (BHLHB2; 604256), and DCR2 (TNFRSF10D; 603614). Staining
with antibodies against p16(INK4a), p15(INK4b), DEC1, and DCR2 revealed
abundant positive cells in adenomas, whereas adenocarcinomas were
essentially negative. By contrast, the proliferation marker Ki-67
revealed a weak proliferative index in adenomas compared with
adenocarcinomas. Collado et al. (2005) concluded that oncogene-induced
senescence may help to restrict tumor progression. They concluded that a
substantial number of cells in premalignant tumors undergo
oncogene-induced senescence, but that cells in malignant tumors are
unable to do this owing to the loss of oncogene-induced senescence
effectors such as p16(INK4a) or p53.

Using an Hras (190020) knockin mouse model, To et al. (2008)
demonstrated that specificity for Kras mutations in lung and Hras
mutations in skin tumors is determined by local regulatory elements in
the target Ras genes. Although the Kras 4A isoform is dispensable for
mouse development, it is the most important isoform for lung
carcinogenesis in vivo and for the inhibitory effect of wildtype Kras on
the mutant allele. Kras 4A expression is detected in a subpopulation of
normal lung epithelial cells, but at very low levels in lung tumors,
suggesting that it may not be required for tumor progression. The 2 Kras
isoforms undergo different posttranslational modifications. To et al.
(2008) concluded that their findings may have implications for the
design of therapeutic strategies for inhibiting oncogenic Kras activity
in human cancers.

Junttila et al. (2010) modeled the probable therapeutic impact of p53
(191170) restoration in a spontaneously evolving mouse model of nonsmall
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) initiated by sporadic oncogenic activation of
endogenous KRAS developed by Jackson et al. (2001). Surprisingly, p53
restoration failed to induce significant regression of established
tumors, although it did result in a significant decrease in the relative
proportion of high-grade tumors. This was due to selective activation of
p53 only in the more aggressive tumor cells within each tumor. Such
selective activation of p53 correlates with marked upregulation in Ras
signal intensity and induction of the oncogenic signaling sensor
p19(ARF) (600160). Junttila et al. (2010) concluded that p53-mediated
tumor suppression is triggered only when oncogenic Ras signal flux
exceeds a critical threshold. Importantly, the failure of low-level
oncogenic Kras to engage p53 reveals inherent limits in the capacity of
p53 to restrain early tumor evolution and in the efficacy of therapeutic
p53 restoration to eradicate cancers.

LUNG CANCER, SOMATIC
KRAS, GLY12CYS

In a cell line of human lung cancer (211980), Nakano et al. (1984)
identified a 34G-T transversion in exon 1 of the KRAS2 gene, resulting
in a gly12-to-cys (G12C) substitution. Studies of the mutant protein
showed that it had transforming abilities consistent with activation of
the gene.

In a study of 106 prospectively enrolled patients with primary
adenocarcinoma of the lung, Ahrendt et al. (2001) found that 92 (87%)
were smokers. KRAS2 mutations were detected in 40 of 106 tumors (38%)
and were significantly more common in smokers compared with nonsmokers
(43% vs 0%; P = 0.001). Thirty-nine of the 40 tumors with KRAS2
mutations had 1 of 4 changes in codon 12, the most common being G12C,
which was present in 25 tumors.

KRAS, GLY12ARG

In a squamous cell lung carcinoma (211980) from a 66-year-old man,
Santos et al. (1984) identified a G-to-C transversion in exon 1 of the
KRAS2 gene, resulting in a gly12-to-arg (G12R) substitution. The
mutation was not identified in the patient's normal bronchial and
pulmonary parenchymal tissues or blood lymphocytes. This mutation had
previously been identified in a bladder cancer (109800) and a lung
cancer.

BREAST ADENOCARCINOMA, SOMATIC
KRAS, GLY13ASP

In a cell line from a human breast adenocarcinoma (114480), Kozma et al.
(1987) identified a heterozygous G-to-A transition in exon 1 of the
KRAS2 gene, resulting in a gly13-to-asp (G13D) substitution and
activation of the protein.

In a human transitional cell bladder carcinoma cell line (109800),
Grimmond et al. (1992) identified a heterozygous G-to-A transition in
the KRAS2 gene, resulting in an ala59-to-thr (A59T) substitution. The
mutation was present in paraffin-embedded tissue from the primary tumor
of the patient.

KRAS, GLY12ASP

Motojima et al. (1993) identified mutations in KRAS codon 12 in 46 of 53
pancreatic carcinomas (260350). In 2 of these 46 tumors, the mutations
were gly12-to-asp (G12D) and gly12-to-val (G12V; 190070.0006),
respectively.

Lee et al. (1995) found mutations in codon 12 of the KRAS gene in 9 of
140 cases of gastric cancer (137215); 2 cases had G12D.

Bourdeaut et al. (2010) found somatic mosaicism for the G12D mutation in
a female infant with an epidermal nevus (162900) who developed a
uterovaginal rhabdomyosarcoma at age 6 months. There was also an
incidental finding of micropolycystic kidneys without impaired renal
function. Both the epidermal nevus and the rhabdomyosarcoma carried the
G12D mutation, which was not found in normal dermal tissue, bone, cheek
swap, or lymphocytes. No renal tissue was available for study. The
phenotype was consistent with broad activation of the KRAS pathway.

Groesser et al. (2012) identified a somatic G12D mutation in 2 of 65
(3%) nevus sebaceous tumors (see 162900). One of the tumors also carried
a somatic mutation in the HRAS gene (G13R; 190020.0017). The KRAS G12D
mutation was also found in somatic mosaic state in a patient with
Schimmelpenning-Feuerstein-Mims syndrome (163200) who was originally
reported by Rijntjes-Jacobs et al. (2010). Groesser et al. (2012)
postulated that the mosaic mutation likely extends to extracutaneous
tissues in that disorder, which could explain the phenotypic pleiotropy.

Hafner et al. (2012) identified a somatic G12D mutation in 1 of 72
keratinocytic epidermal nevi.

Groesser et al. (2012) identified a somatic G12V mutation in 1 (2%) of
65 nevus sebaceous tumors (see 162900). The tumor also carried a somatic
mutation in the HRAS gene (G13R; 190020.0017).

.0007
GASTRIC CANCER, SOMATIC
KRAS, GLY12SER

Lee et al. (1995) found mutations in codon 12 of the KRAS2 gene in 9 of
140 cases of gastric cancer (137215); 7 cases had a G-to-A transition,
resulting in a gly12-to-ser (G12S) substitution.

LEUKEMIA, ACUTE MYELOGENOUS
KRAS, 3-BP INS, GLY11INS

In the bone marrow of a 4-year-old child with acute myeloid leukemia
(AML; 601626), Bollag et al. (1996) identified an in-frame 3-bp
insertion in exon 1 of the KRAS2 gene, resulting in an insertion of
gly11. Expression of the mutant protein in NIH 3T3 cells caused cellular
transformation, and expression in COS cells activated the
RAS-mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway. RAS-GTP levels
measured in COS cells established that this novel mutant accumulates up
to 90% in the GTP state, considerably higher than a residue 12 mutant.
This mutation was the first dominant RAS mutation found in human cancer
that did not involve residues 12, 13, or 61.

.0009
CARDIOFACIOCUTANEOUS SYNDROME 2
KRAS, GLY60ARG

In an individual with CFC syndrome (CFC2; 615278), Niihori et al. (2006)
identified a heterozygous 178G-C transversion in exon 2 of the KRAS2
gene, predicting a gly60-to-arg (G60R) amino acid change.

.0010

NOONAN SYNDROME 3, INCLUDED
KRAS, ASP153VAL

In 2 unrelated individuals with CFC syndrome (CFC2; 615278), Niihori et
al. (2006) identified a heterozygous 458A-T transversion in exon 4b of
the KRAS2 gene, predicting an asp153-to-val (D153V) amino acid change.
The D153V mutation was identified in DNA extracted from both blood and
buccal cells of 1 of the individuals. This heterozygous mutation and
G60R (190070.0009) were not found in 100 control chromosomes and were
not found in any parent. The results suggested that these germline
mutations occurred de novo.

Schubbert et al. (2006) found the D153V mutation in a patient who had
been diagnosed with Noonan syndrome-3 (609942). The 18-year-old male had
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, dysplastic mitral valve with prolapse,
Noonan-like features, short stature, mild pectus carinatum, unilateral
cryptorchidism, mild developmental delay, and grand mal seizures.

.0011
NOONAN SYNDROME 3
KRAS, THR58ILE

In a 3-month-old female with Noonan syndrome-3 (609942), Schubbert et
al. (2006) identified a heterozygous 173C-T transition in the KRAS2
gene, resulting in a thr58-to-ile (T58I) substitution. The child had a
severe clinical phenotype and presented with a myeloproliferative
disorder of the juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML; 607785) type.
The mutation was present in the patient's buccal cells but was absent in
parental DNA. Clinical features included atrial septal defect,
ventricular septal defect, valvular pulmonary stenosis, dysmorphic
facial features, short stature, webbed neck, severe developmental delay,
macrocephaly, and sagittal suture synostosis.

Kratz et al. (2009) identified a de novo heterozygous T58I mutation in a
patient with Noonan syndrome who also had craniosynostosis, suggesting a
genotype/phenotype correlation. The findings indicated that dysregulated
RAS signaling may lead to abnormal growth or premature calvarian
closure.

.0012
NOONAN SYNDROME 3
KRAS, VAL14ILE

In 3 of 124 unrelated individuals with Noonan syndrome-3 (609942)
without mutations in PTPN11 (176876), Schubbert et al. (2006) identified
a heterozygous 40G-A transition in the KRAS2 gene, resulting in a
val14-to-ile (V14I) substitution. Each individual showed a mild clinical
phenotype, and none had a history of myeloproliferative disorder or
cancer.

.0013
CARDIOFACIOCUTANEOUS SYNDROME 2
KRAS, PRO34ARG

In a 13-year-old female with the diagnosis of cardiofaciocutaneous
syndrome (CFC2; 615278), Schubbert et al. (2006) found a heterozygous
pro34-to-arg (P34R) mutation in the KRAS2 gene. The patient had pulmonic
stenosis, left ventricular hypertrophy, Noonan-like facial features,
short stature, short neck, broad thorax, lymphedema, chylothorax, left
ptosis, severe developmental delay, and agenesis of the corpus callosum.

.0014
NOONAN SYNDROME 3
KRAS, VAL152GLY

In a 1-year-old girl with the diagnosis of Noonan syndrome-3 (609942),
Carta et al. (2006) identified a 455T-G transversion in the KRAS2 gene,
resulting in a val152-to-gly (V152G) substitution. The patient had
macrocephaly with high and broad forehead, curly and sparse hair,
hypertelorism, strabismus, epicanthic folds, downslanting palpebral
fissures, hypoplastic nasal bridge with bulbous tip of the nose, high
palate and macroglossia, low-set and posteriorly rotated ears, short
neck with redundant skin, wide-set nipples, and umbilical hernia. She
had been born at 32 weeks' gestation by cesarean section after a
pregnancy complicated by a cystic hygroma detected at 12 weeks and
polyhydramnios at 30 weeks. At birth she showed edema of the lower
limbs. The phenotype showed features overlapping Costello syndrome
(218040) (polyhydramnios, neonatal macrosomia, and macrocephaly, loose
skin, and severe failure to thrive) and, to a lesser extent, CFC
syndrome (115150) (macrocephaly and sparse hair).

.0015
NOONAN SYNDROME 3
KRAS, ASP153VAL

In a 14-year-old girl with Noonan syndrome-3 (609942) and some features
of CFC syndrome (115150), Carta et al. (2006) identified a 458A-T
transversion in the KRAS2 gene, resulting in an asp153-to-val (D153V)
substitution. The girl had short stature and growth retardation and
delayed bone age, cardiac defects (moderate ventricular hypertrophy,
mild pulmonic stenosis, and atrial septal defect), dysmorphic features
(hypertelorism, downslanting palpebral fissures, strabismus, low-set and
thick ears, relative macrocephaly with high forehead, and a depressed
nasal bridge), short and mildly webbed neck, wide-set nipples, and
developmental delay. There was hyperpigmentation of the skin and a large
cafe-au-lait spot on the face. Gestation was complicated by
polyhydramnios.

PILOCYTIC ASTROCYTOMA, SOMATIC
KRAS, GLY13ARG

In 1 of 21 sporadic pilocytic astrocytoma (PA) (see 137800) samples,
Sharma et al. (2005) identified a G-to-C transversion in the KRAS2 gene,
resulting in a gly13-to-arg (G13R) substitution. The tumor arose in the
cortex of an 11-year-old boy; the mutation was not identified in the
germline of the patient. Immunohistochemical studies showed increased
phospho-AKT (see 164730) activity compared to controls in all 21 PA
samples, indicating increased activation of the Ras pathway. No
mutations in the KRAS gene were observed in the other tumors, and none
of the 21 tumors showed mutations in the HRAS (190020) or NRAS (164790)
genes. Of note, the G13R substitution occurs in the same codon as
another KRAS mutation (G13D; 190070.0003) identified in a breast
carcinoma cell line.

CARDIOFACIOCUTANEOUS SYNDROME 2
KRAS, LYS5ASN

In a 7.5-month-old male infant with a clinical diagnosis of Costello
syndrome (218040), Zenker et al. (2007) identified a heterozygous 15A-T
transversion in exon 1 of the KRAS2 gene, resulting in a lys5-to-asn
(K5N) substitution. The patient had hypertelorism, downslanting
palpebral fissures, coarse facies, pectus carinatum, sparse hair,
redundant skin, and moderate mental retardation. Zenker et al. (2007)
noted that the patient may later develop features of CFC (CFC2; 615278),
which is commonly associated with KRAS mutations, but emphasized that
the findings underscored the central role of Ras in the pathogenesis of
these phenotypically related disorders.

Kerr et al. (2008) commented that the diagnosis of Costello syndrome
should be used only to refer to patients with mutations in the HRAS gene
(190020).

CARDIOFACIOCUTANEOUS SYNDROME 2
KRAS, PHE156LEU

In a male infant with a clinical diagnosis of Costello syndrome (218040)
who died suddenly at age 14 months, Zenker et al. (2007) identified a
heterozygous 468C-G transversion in the KRAS2 gene, resulting in a
phe156-to-leu (F156L) substitution. The patient had coarse facies,
cardiac defects, sparse hair, loose and redundant skin, developmental
delay, and moderate mental retardation. Zenker et al. (2007) noted that
the patient may later develop features of CFC (CFC2; 615278), which is
commonly associated with KRAS mutations, but emphasized that the
findings underscored the central role of Ras in the pathogenesis of
these phenotypically related disorders.

Kerr et al. (2008) commented that the diagnosis of Costello syndrome
should be used only to refer to patients with mutations in the HRAS gene
(190020).

NOONAN SYNDROME 3
KRAS, LYS5GLU

In a 20-year-old woman with clinical features typical of Costello
syndrome (218040) and additional findings seen in Noonan syndrome
(609942), Bertola et al. (2007) identified a 194A-G transition in exon 2
of the KRAS gene, resulting in a lys5-to-glu (K5E) substitution. The
mutation was not found in her unaffected mother or brother or in 100
controls.

Kerr et al. (2008) commented that the diagnosis of Costello syndrome
should be used only to refer to patients with mutations in the HRAS gene
(190020).

Bertola et al. (2012) reported a patient with a germline K5E mutation
and dysmorphic features who developed multiple diffuse schwannomas.

.0020
NOONAN SYNDROME 3
KRAS, GLY60SER

In a patient with Noonan syndrome-3 (609942) and craniosynostosis, Kratz
et al. (2009) identified a de novo heterozygous 178G-A transition in the
KRAS gene, resulting in a gly60-to-ser (G60S) substitution. The findings
indicated that dysregulated RAS signaling may lead to abnormal growth or
premature calvarian closure.

A mutation in this same codon (G60R; 190070.0009) has been found in a
patient with cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome (115150).

.0021
CARDIOFACIOCUTANEOUS SYNDROME 2
KRAS, TYR71HIS

In a mother and son with variable features of cardiofaciocutaneous
syndrome (CFC2; 615278), Stark et al. (2012) identified a heterozygous
211T-C transition in exon 3 of the KRAS gene, resulting in a
tyr71-to-his (Y71H) substitution in a highly conserved residue close to
a region that is important for effector and regulator binding. The
mutation was not found in 500 control individuals and was shown by in
vitro studies to increase effector affinity. The son had delayed
psychomotor development and a distinctive appearance, including curly
hair, absent eyebrows, and broad forehead. Echocardiogram was normal at
age 3 years. His mother had a similar physical appearance and also had
high-arched palate, myopia, and mitral valve prolapse. She had attended
a school for children with special needs. Both patients showed signs of
a peripheral sensorimotor axonal neuropathy, more severe in the mother,
who developed Charcot arthropathy of the feet. PMP22 (601097) testing in
the mother was negative, but an additional cause of the neuropathy could
not be excluded. The authors stated that this was the first documented
vertically transmitted KRAS mutation.

.0022
CARDIOFACIOCUTANEOUS SYNDROME 2
KRAS, LYS147GLU

In a girl with variable features of CFC (CFC2; 615278), Stark et al.
(2012) identified a de novo heterozygous 439A-G transition in exon 4 of
the KRAS gene, resulting in a lys147-to-glu (K147E) substitution in a
highly conserved residue close to known mutations. Lys147 is part of a
motif involved in the binding network for guanine nucleotides, which
determine the activation state of RAS proteins. In vitro studies
demonstrated that the K147E mutant protein predominates in the active
GTP-bound form, probably due to facilitated uncatalyzed GDP/GTP
exchange. The patient was 1 of a female dizygotic twin pair; the other
twin was unaffected. The patient had a high birth weight, macrocephaly,
and abnormal craniofacial features, including proptosis, hypertelorism,
downslanting palpebral fissures, low-set ears, and short neck,
suggestive of Noonan syndrome. Reexamination at age 3.5 years showed
coarser facial features more consistent with CFC. She also had
hypertrophy of the interventricular myocardial septum, myocardial
hypertrophy, and pulmonic stenosis. She had mildly delayed development.

614463	TITLE *614463 NMYC DOWNSTREAM-REGULATED GENE 4; NDRG4
;;SMOOTH MUSCLE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 8; SMAP8;;
KIAA1180
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Hirosawa et al. (1999) cloned NDRG4. The deduced protein
contains 273 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA detected highest expression in
adult and fetal brain and adult heart, followed by lung and testis.
Lower expression was detected in other adult tissues examined, but
little to no expression was detected in fetal liver. High NDRG4
expression was detected in all specific adult brain regions examined,
with highest expression in amygdala, cerebellum, and thalamus.

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to NDRG1 (605262),
followed by 3-prime and 5-prime RACE of human brain and heart cDNA
libraries and cap-site hunting, Zhou et al. (2001) cloned 3 splice
variants of NDRG4. The variants NDRG4B and NDRG4B-var, which were
obtained from the brain library, encode deduced proteins of 339 and 352
amino acids with calculated molecular masses of 37.1 and 38.5 kD,
respectively. Compared with NDRG4B, NDRG4B-var has a 14-amino acid
insertion near the C terminus. The variant NDRG4H, which was obtained
from the heart library, encodes a deduced 371-amino acid protein with a
calculated molecular mass of 40.6 kD. NDRG4H differs from NDRG4B and
NDRG4B-var at its N-terminal end, and it lacks the 14-amino acid
insertion. Northern blot analysis detected NDRG4 transcripts of about
3.2 kb in brain and heart only. Variant-specific probes showed NDRG4B
expression in brain only, whereas NDRG4H was expressed in both brain and
heart, with higher expression in heart. RT-PCR confirmed expression of
all 3 variants in brain and of NDRG4H in heart. RNA dot-blot analysis
revealed NDRG4 expression in spinal cord, all specific brain regions
examined, and all specific heart regions examined except aorta.
Expression was also detected in spleen, lymph node, testis, adrenal
gland, and fetal brain and heart, but not in other tissues examined. In
situ hybridization of normal adult brain detected NDRG4 mRNA in
cytoplasm of neurons in cerebral cortex, cerebellum, mesencephalon,
pons, medulla oblongata, and spinal cord. No signal was detected in
peripheral nerves or other cell types, such as glial cells. Western blot
analysis of endogenous or exogenously expressed proteins showed that
NDRG4B, NDRG4B-var, and NDRG4H had apparent molecular masses of 37, 39,
and 41 kD, respectively.

Using expression profiling to identify genes expressed in aortic smooth
muscle, followed by screening a heart cDNA library, Nishimoto et al.
(2003) cloned NDRG4, which they called SMAP8. The deduced 371-amino acid
protein has a calculated molecular mass of 40.7 kD. Northern blot
analysis detected high expression of an approximately 3.3-kb transcript
in heart and brain, with little to no expression in other tissues
examined. PCR analysis showed moderate expression in aorta and vascular
smooth muscle cells. Western blot analysis of heart and brain detected
SMAP8 at an apparent molecular mass of about 45 kD. SMAP8 localized to
the cytoplasmic fraction of transfected A10 embryonic rat aortic smooth
muscle cells.

By in situ hybridization of adult mouse brain, Yamamoto et al. (2011)
detected wide distribution of Ndrg4 in neurons, but not in astrocytes.
Western blot analysis of adult mouse brain detected 3 Ndrg4 isoforms
representing orthologs of human NDRG4B, NDRG4B-var, and NDRG4H.

GENE FUNCTION

Nishimoto et al. (2003) showed that homocysteine upregulated SMAP8
expression in primary human aortic smooth muscle cells and rat A10
cells, but not in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Proliferation
and migration of A10 cells significantly decreased following expression
of human SMAP8. SMAP8 was phosphorylated by a serine/threonine kinase
via activation of a PDGF (see 173430) signaling pathway. In addition,
ERK1 (MAPK3; 601795)/ERK2 (MAPK1; 176948) and MEK1 (MAP2K1; 176872)/MEK2
(MAP2K2; 601263) were activated in SMAP8-transfected A10 cells.

Hongo et al. (2006) found that overexpression of 1 of the 6 isoforms of
rat Ndrg4, Ndrg4c2, in PC12 rat pheochromocytoma cells reduced NGF (see
162030)-induced phosphorylation of Elk1 (311040), a nuclear target of
Erk. Reporter gene assays revealed that Ndrg4c2 suppressed Elk1-mediated
activation of a serum response element.

By RT-PCR and immunohistochemical analysis, Schilling et al. (2009)
found that NDRG4 expression was increased in glioblastoma multiforme
(GBM; see 137800) compared with normal human astrocytes. Knockdown of
NDRG4 via short hairpin RNA reduced the viability of GBM cells via G1
cell cycle arrest and subsequent apoptosis. Knockdown of NDRG4 also
reduced the viability of several GBM cell lines and primary astrocytes.
Knockdown of NDRG4 in GBM tumor xenografts reduced tumor growth
following intracranial injection in immunocompromised mice.
Overexpression of NDRG4B or NDRG4H did not affect cell viability.

GENE STRUCTURE

Zhou et al. (2001) determined that the NDRG4 gene contains 17 exons and
spans 26 kb. Exons 1 and 2 are specific for NDRG4H, exon 3 is specific
for NDRG4B and NDGR4B-var, and exon 16 is specific for NDRG4B-var. The
region upstream of exon 1 contains a GGCG sequence that may represent a
TATA-less promoter for NDRG4H expression. The region upstream of exon 3
contains a consensus TATA box and 2 CCAAT sequences and may represent
the promoter for NDRG4B and NDRG4B-var expression.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Zhou et al. (2001) mapped the NDRG4 gene
to chromosome 16q21-q22.3.

ANIMAL MODEL

Yamamoto et al. (2011) found that Ndrg4 -/- mice were born at the
expected mendelian ratio, appeared normal, and were fertile. However,
Ndrg4 -/- mice showed deficits in spatial learning and memory, and they
exhibited increased sensitivity to ischemic stress following middle
cerebral artery occlusion. Consistent with these findings, Ndrg4 -/-
mice had reduced expression of the neuroprotective factor Bdnf (113505).

600201	TITLE *600201 AGOUTI SIGNALING PROTEIN; ASIP
;;ASP;;
AGOUTI, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF; AGTI
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The study of mouse coat color genes and their interactions provides
insights into many processes relevant to human development and disease.
The agouti gene on mouse chromosome 2 encodes a paracrine signaling
molecule that causes hair follicle melanocytes to synthesize
pheomelanin, a yellow pigment, instead of the black or brown pigment
eumelanin. Consequently, agouti mice produce hairs with a subapical
yellow band on an otherwise black or brown background when expressed
during the midportion of hair growth. The cloned mouse agouti gene
encodes a distinctive 131-amino acid protein with a consensus signal
peptide, indicating that the protein is probably secreted (Kwon et al.,
1994). It is normally expressed in neonatal skin. In most mice, agouti
is expressed at highest levels in skin and is under control of hair
cycle- and ventral-specific promoters, which together produce a
light-bellied phenotype, i.e., a combination of yellow ventral hairs and
banded dorsal hairs. In several mouse mutations, such as 'lethal yellow'
and 'viable yellow,' agouti is deregulated and expressed ectopically.
Expression throughout hair growth and in nearly every tissue of the body
produces a yellow coat and pleiotropic effects that include adult-onset
obesity, increased tumor susceptibility, and premature infertility.

Using an interspecies DNA-hybridization approach, Kwon et al. (1994)
cloned the human homolog of the mouse agouti gene. Sequence analysis
demonstrated that the coding region of the human gene is 85% identical
to that of the mouse gene and has the potential to encode a protein of
132 amino acids with a consensus signal peptide. Expression studies with
RNA from several adult human tissues showed that the gene is expressed
in adipose tissues and testis. The question of a functional role in the
regulation of lipid metabolism within the adipocyte was raised, and the
mapping to the same region as the locus for MODY1 (125850) was noted.

Using linkage groups conserved between mice and humans, Wilson et al.
(1995) cloned the human homolog of the mouse agouti gene from a human
chromosome 20 YAC known to contain S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase
(180960), located on 20cen-q13.1 and known to be closely linked to
agouti in mouse. They named the human homolog 'agouti signaling protein'
(ASP) and confirmed that it encodes a 132-amino acid protein. They
showed, furthermore, that its mRNA is expressed in testes, ovary, and
heart, and at lower levels in liver, kidney, and foreskin. As predicted
by the interactions of mouse agouti with the 'extension' gene, which
encodes the melanocyte receptor for alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone
(MC1R; 155555), expression of ASP in transgenic mice produced a yellow
coat, and expression of ASP in cell culture blocked the MC1R-stimulated
accumulation of cAMP in mouse melanoma cells. The localization of ASP on
chromosome 20cen-q13.1 relative to other 20q loci excluded it as a
candidate for the MODY1 locus, which maps to 20q12-q13.1.

MAPPING

Kwon et al. (1994) mapped the human agouti gene to chromosome 20q11.2 by
somatic cell hybrid mapping panels and fluorescence in situ
hybridization.

GENE FUNCTION

Zemel et al. (1995) examined the status of intracellular Ca(2+) in mice
carrying the dominant agouti allele, viable yellow, since intracellular
Ca(2+) is believed to play a role in mediating insulin action and
dysregulation of Ca(2+) flux is observed in diabetic animals and humans.
They showed that in mice carrying this mutation, intracellular free
calcium concentration is elevated in skeletal muscle, and the degree of
elevation is closely correlated with the degree to which the mutant
traits are expressed in individual animals. They also demonstrated that
the agouti gene product is capable of inducing increased intracellular
free calcium in cultured and freshly isolated skeletal muscle myocytes
from wildtype mice. Based on these findings, Zemel et al. (1995)
proposed that the agouti polypeptide promotes insulin resistance in
mutant animals through its ability to increase intracellular calcium
ion.

Manne et al. (1995) reviewed the mechanisms for the pleiotropic effects
of the agouti gene and discussed the implications for human disease.
Expression of the human agouti gene was detected in adipose tissue,
heart, and testis, suggesting a role in a variety of processes including
skin pigmentation, cardiovascular function, and energy metabolism. In
addition, the observation of agouti expression in premenopausal but not
postmenopausal ovaries suggested a role for the agouti protein in
fertility as well. Observations of elevated intracellular calcium ion
levels in tissues from hypertensive, obese, and diabetic patients
suggest that the agouti protein may be a common link between these
diseases. The level of expression of the agouti gene may be dictated by
a series of alleles in the human population that can predispose
individuals to obesity, cardiovascular disease, and/or diabetes.

Graham et al. (1997) stated that the ectopic expression of agouti
produces obesity by mimicking the normal action of AGRT (602311) in the
hypothalamus.

Chronic antagonism of melanocortin receptors by the paracrine-acting
agouti gene product induces both yellow fur and a maturity-onset obesity
syndrome in mice that ubiquitously express wildtype agouti. Functional
analysis of agouti mutations in transgenic mice indicate that the
cysteine-rich C terminus, signal peptide, and glycosylation site are
required for agouti activity in vivo. In contrast, no biologic activity
has been ascribed to the conserved basic domain consisting of
approximately 30 amino acids of predominantly basic residues in the
center of the protein in all mammals in which it has been studied. To
examine the functional significance of the agouti basic domain in the
mouse, Miltenberger et al. (1999) deleted the entire 29-amino acid
region from the agouti cDNA, and the resulting mutation was expressed in
transgenic mice under the control of the human beta-actin promoter.
Three independent lines of mutant transgenic mice all developed some
degree of yellow pigment in the fur, indicating that the mutant protein
was functional in vivo. However, none of the mutant transgenic mice
developed completely yellow fur, obesity, hyperinsulinism, or
hyperglycinemia. High levels of expression of the mutant protein in
relevant tissues exceeded the level of agouti expression in obese viable
yellow mice, suggesting that suboptimal activity or synthesis of the
mutant protein, rather than insufficient RNA synthesis, accounted for
the phenotype of the mutant transgenic mice. These findings indicated a
functional role for the agouti basic domain in vivo, possibly
influencing the biogenesis of secreted agouti protein or modulating
protein-protein interactions that contribute to effective antagonism of
melanocortin receptors.

Epigenetic modifications have effects on phenotype, but they are
generally considered to be cleared on passage through the germline in
mammals, so that only genetic traits are inherited. Morgan et al. (1999)
describe the inheritance of an epigenetic modification at the agouti
locus in mice. In viable yellow mice, transcription originating in an
intracisternal A particle (IAP) retrotransposon inserted upstream of the
agouti gene causes ectopic expression of agouti protein, resulting in
yellow fur, obesity, diabetes, and increased susceptibility to tumors.
The pleiotropic effects of ectopic agouti expression are presumably due
to effects of the paracrine signal on other tissues. Viable yellow mice
display variable expressivity because they are epigenetic mosaics for
activity of the retrotransposon. Isogenic viable yellow mice have coats
that vary in a continuous spectrum from full yellow through variegated
yellow/agouti to full agouti (pseudoagouti). The distribution of
phenotypes among offspring is related to the phenotype of the dam, and
when a viable yellow dam has the agouti phenotype, her offspring are
more likely to be agouti. Morgan et al. (1999) demonstrated that this
maternal epigenetic effect is not the result of a maternally contributed
environment. By using an alternative combination of genetic and
embryo-transfer experiments, Morgan et al. (1999) found that the
nonrandom distribution of coat color results from an incomplete erasure
of an epigenetic modification when a silenced viable yellow allele is
passed through the female germline, with consequent inheritance of the
epigenetic modification. Morgan et al. (1999) suggested that since
retrotransposons are abundant in mammalian genomes, this type of
inheritance may be common.

In mouse follicular melanocytes, production of eumelanins and
pheomelanins is under the control of 2 intercellular signaling molecules
that exert opposite actions: alpha-MSH (see 176830), which
preferentially increases the synthesis of eumelanins, and ASP, whose
expression favors the production of hair containing pheomelanins.
Aberdam et al. (1998) reported that ASP not only affects mature
melanocytes but can also inhibit the differentiation of melanoblasts.
They showed that both alpha-MSH and forskolin promote the
differentiation of murine melanoblasts into mature melanocytes, and that
ASP inhibits this process. Expression of MITF (156845) and its binding
to an M-box regulatory element is inhibited by ASP. Aberdam et al.
(1998) also showed that in a murine melanoma cell line, ASP inhibits
alpha-MSH-stimulated expression of tyrosinase (see 606933), TYRP1
(115501), and TYRP2 (191275) through an inhibition of the
transcriptional activity of their respective promoters. Further, ASP
inhibits alpha-MSH-induced expression of the MITF gene and reduces the
level of MITF in the cells. Aberdam et al. (1998) concluded that ASP can
regulate both melanoblast differentiation and melanogenesis, pointing
out the key role of MITF in the control of these processes.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In mice and humans, binding of alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone to
the melanocyte-stimulating-hormone receptor (MSHR), the protein product
of the melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R; 155555) gene, leads to the
synthesis of eumelanin. In the mouse, ligation of MSHR by ASP results in
the production of pheomelanin. The binding of ASP to MSHR precludes
alpha-MSH-initiated signaling and thus blocks production of cAMP,
leading to a downregulation of eumelanogenesis. The net result is
increased synthesis of pheomelanin. Kanetsky et al. (2002) undertook to
characterize the ASIP gene in a group of white subjects to assess
whether ASIP was a determinant of human pigmentation and whether this
gene is associated with increased melanoma risk. They found no evidence
of coding region sequence variation in ASIP, but detected an 8818A-G
polymorphism in the 3-prime untranslated region (dbSNP rs6058017;
600201.0001). They genotyped 746 participants in a study of melanoma
susceptibility for this polymorphism. Among 147 healthy controls, the
frequency of the G allele was 0.12. Carriage of the G allele was
significantly associated with dark hair (odds ratio 1.8) and brown eyes
(odds ratio 1.9) after adjusting for age, gender, and disease status.
This was said to be the first report of an association of ASIP with
specific human pigmentation characteristics. It remained to be
investigated whether the interaction of MC1R and ASIP can enhance
prediction of human pigmentation and melanoma risk.

In a large genomewide association study of human pigmentation
characteristics among 5,130 Icelanders, with follow-up analyses in 2,116
Icelanders and 1,214 Dutch individuals, Sulem et al. (2008) found strong
association of an extended haplotype tagged by a 2-SNP haplotype, dbSNP
rs1015362G and dbSNP rs4911414T, with red hair color, freckling, and
skin sensitivity to sun, in addition to burning and freckling. The
association was stronger than that found for dbSNP rs6058017, and after
adjustment for the ASIP haplotype, dbSNP rs6058017 was only marginally
associated with pigmentation characteristics. The SNPs dbSNP rs1015362
and dbSNP rs4911414 lie outside the ASIP gene itself.

Gudbjartsson et al. (2008) found association of the ASIP haplotype of
Sulem et al. (2008) with susceptibility to cutaneous malignant melanoma
and basal cell carcinoma (see CMM7, 612263).

EVOLUTION

Linnen et al. (2009) studied cryptically colored deer mice living on the
Nebraska Sand Hills, a dune field with soil mostly consisting of quartz
grains that are lighter in color than the surrounding soils. The authors
showed that the light coloration of these mice stems from a novel
banding pattern on individual hairs produced by an increase in Agouti
expression. This increase is caused by a cis-acting mutation (or
mutations), which either is or is closely linked to a single amino acid
deletion in Agouti that appears to be under selection. Linnen et al.
(2009) noted that their data suggests that this derived Agouti allele
arose de novo after the formation of the Sand Hills, which date to
between 8,000 to 15,000 years ago. Linnen et al. (2009) concluded that
their findings revealed one means by which genetic, developmental, and
evolutionary mechanisms can drive rapid adaptation under ecologic
pressure.

ANIMAL MODEL

Mice that carry the lethal yellow or viable yellow mutation, 2 dominant
mutations of the agouti gene on mouse chromosome 2, exhibit a phenotype
that includes yellow fur, marked obesity, a form of type II diabetes
associated with insulin resistance, and an increased susceptibility to
tumor development. Klebig et al. (1995) generated transgenic mice that
ectopically expressed an agouti cDNA clone encoding the normal agouti
protein in all tissues examined. Transgenic mice of both sexes had
yellow fur, became obese, and developed hyperinsulinemia. In addition,
male transgenic mice developed hyperglycemia by 12 to 20 weeks of age.
The results demonstrated that the ectopic agouti expression is
responsible for most, if not all, of the phenotypic traits of the
dominant, 'obese yellow' mutants.

Eizirik et al. (2003) studied the molecular genetics and evolution of
melanism in the cat family. Melanistic coat coloration occurs as a
common polymorphism in 11 of 37 felid species and reaches high
population frequency in some cases but never achieves complete fixation.
Eizirik et al. (2003) mapped, cloned, and sequenced the cat homologs of
2 putative candidate genes for melanism, ASIP (agouti) and
melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R; 155555), and identified 3 independent
deletions associated with dark coloration in 3 different felid species.
Association and transmission analyses showed that a 2-bp deletion in the
ASIP gene specifies black coloration in domestic cats, and 2 different
in-frame deletions in the MC1R gene are implicated in melanism in
jaguars and jaguarundis. Melanistic individuals from 5 other felid
species did not carry any of these mutations, implying that there are at
least 4 independent genetic origins for melanism in the cat family. The
inferred multiple origins and independent historical elevation in
population frequency of felid melanistic mutations suggested the
occurrence of adaptive evolution of this visible phenotype in a group of
related free-ranging species.

Drogemuller et al. (2006) identified a mutation in the noncoding region
of the Asip gene as the cause of black-and-tan coat pigmentation in
Mangalitza pigs.

The agouti-yellow (Ay) deletion is the only genetic modifier known to
suppress testicular germ cell tumor (TGCT; 273300) susceptibility in
mice or human. The Ay mutation deletes Raly and Eif2s2 (603908) and
induces the ectopic expression of agouti, all of which are potential
TGCT-modifying mutations. Heaney et al. (2009) reported that the reduced
TGCT incidence of heterozygous Ay male mice and the recessive embryonic
lethality of Ay are caused by the deletion of Eif2s2. The incidence of
affected males was reduced 2-fold in mice that were partially deficient
for Eif2s2 and that embryonic lethality occurred near the time of
implantation in mice that were fully deficient for Eif2s2. In contrast,
neither reduced expression of Raly in gene-trap mice nor ectopic
expression of agouti in transgenic or viable-yellow (Avy) mutants
affected TGCT incidence or embryonic viability. Partial deficiency of
Eif2s2 attenuated germ cell proliferation and differentiation, both of
which are important to TGCT formation. Heaney et al. (2009) concluded
that germ cell development and TGCT pathogenesis are sensitive to the
availability of the eIF2 translation initiation complex and to changes
in the rate of translation.

models for mouse obesity involving agouti.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
SKIN/HAIR/EYE PIGMENTATION 9, DARK/LIGHT HAIR
SKIN/HAIR/EYE PIGMENTATION 9, BROWN/NONBROWN EYES, INCLUDED
ASIP, 8818A-G

By PCR and direct sequencing of the ASIP gene in 105 healthy control
subjects, Kanetsky et al. (2002) identified a polymorphism in the
3-prime untranslated region of the ASIP gene, 8818A-G (dbSNP rs6058017),
25 bp downstream of the termination codon in exon 4. They genotyped 147
healthy controls, 176 patients with dysplastic nevi, and 423 patients
with melanoma (155600) for the 8818A-G polymorphism. Carriage of the G
allele was significantly associated with having dark hair (OR = 1.8; 95%
CI 1.2-2.8) and brown eyes (OR = 1.9; 95% CI 1.3-2.7) (SHEP9; 611742).
An allele dosage effect such that homozygous carriers had an increased
likelihood of having dark hair and brown eyes compared to heterozygous
carriers was indicated.

Sulem et al. (2008) found that after adjustment for a 2-SNP haplotype
near, but not within, the ASIP gene, dbSNP rs6058017 was only marginally
associated with pigmentation characteristics.

;;PROMININ, MOUSE, HOMOLOG-LIKE 1; PROML1;;
AC133;;
CD133 ANTIGEN; CD133
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Maw et al. (2000) stated that the prominin 5-transmembrane domain
glycoprotein was originally identified as a protein that selectively
localized at the apical surface of murine neuroepithelial cells, whereas
PROML1 was identified as an antigenic marker (AC133 antigen) in
hematopoietic stem cells (Miraglia et al., 1997; Yin et al., 1997) and
found to be expressed in retinoblastoma cell lines and adult retina. The
gene encodes an 865-amino acid glycoprotein (Miraglia et al., 1997) and
is conserved throughout the animal kingdom.

Yu et al. (2002) cloned an AC133 splice variant that lacks the 27-bp
exon 3. They termed this isoform ACC133-2 and the longer isoform
AC133-1. Both isoforms encode glycosylated membrane proteins. PCR
analysis showed that AC133-2 was predominantly expressed in a variety of
fetal and adult tissues and in several carcinomas. In contrast, AC133-1
was prominent in fetal brain and adult skeletal muscle and absent in
fetal liver and kidney and in adult pancreas, kidney, bone marrow,
hematopoietic stem cells, and placenta. RT-PCR and flow cytometric
analysis revealed expression of AC133-2 in basal epidermal stem cells,
and the expression was downregulated in cultured basal cells. Yu et al.
(2002) concluded that AC133-2, not AC133-1, is the isoform expressed in
multiple stem cell niches, potentially providing a means to isolate
specific stem cell subpopulations from human tissues.

GENE STRUCTURE

Maw et al. (2000) determined that most of the PROM1 gene is contained in
23 exons distributed over more than 50 kb of genomic sequence.

MAPPING

Maw et al. (2000) noted that D4S1601 and D4S3048, which are located on
human chromosome 4p15.3-p15.2, map within intronic sequences of the
PROML1 gene.

GENE FUNCTION

Torrente et al. (2004) reported that a subpopulation of circulating
cells expressing AC133, a well-characterized marker of hematopoietic
stem cells, also expresses early myogenic markers. Freshly isolated,
circulating AC133(+) cells were induced to undergo myogenesis when
cocultured with myogenic cells or exposed in vitro to Wnt-producing
cells. Myogenesis was also induced when the circulating AC133(+) cells
were delivered in vivo through the arterial circulation or directly into
the muscles of transgenic scid/mdx mice, which are a model of Duchenne
muscular dystrophy (DMD; 310200) that tolerate human donor cells.
Injected cells also localized under the basal lamina of host muscle
fibers and expressed satellite cell markers such as M-cadherin (114019)
and MYF5 (159990). Functional tests of injected muscles revealed a
substantial recovery of force after treatment. Torrente et al. (2004)
suggested that because these cells can be isolated from the blood,
manipulated in vitro, and delivered through the circulation, they
represent a possible tool for future cell therapy applications in DMD
and other muscular dystrophies.

Singh et al. (2003) prospectively isolated a CD133-positive cell
subpopulation from human brain tumors that exhibited stem cell
properties in vitro. However, the true measures of cancer stem cells are
their capacity for self renewal and exact recapitulation of the original
tumor. Singh et al. (2004) reported the development of a xenograft assay
that identified human brain tumor-initiating cells that initiate tumors
in vivo. Only the CD133-positive brain tumor fraction contained cells
that were capable of tumor initiation in NOD-SCID mouse brains.
Injections of as few as 100 CD133-positive cells produced a tumor that
could be serially transplanted and was a phenocopy of the patient's
original tumor, whereas injection of 10(5) CD133-negative cells
engrafted but did not cause a tumor. Thus, Singh et al. (2004) concluded
that the identification of brain tumor-initiating cells provides
insights into human brain tumor pathogenesis, giving strong support for
the cancer stem cell hypothesis as the basis for many solid tumors.

Bao et al. (2006) showed that cancer stem cells contribute to glioma
radioresistance through preferential activation of the DNA damage
checkpoint response and an increase in DNA repair capacity. The fraction
of tumor cells expressing CD133, a marker for both neural stem cells and
brain cancer stem cells, is enriched after radiation in gliomas. In both
cell culture and the brains of immunocompromised mice, CD133-expressing
glioma cells survived ionizing radiation in increased proportions
relative to most tumor cells, which lack CD133. CD133-expressing tumor
cells isolated from both human glioma xenografts and primary patient
glioblastoma specimens preferentially activated the DNA damage
checkpoint in response to radiation, and repaired radiation-induced DNA
damage more effectively than CD133-negative tumor cells. In addition,
Bao et al. (2006) found that the radioresistance of CD133-positive
glioma stem cells could be reversed with a specific inhibitor of the
CHK1 (603078) and CHK2 (604373) checkpoint kinases. Bao et al. (2006)
concluded that CD133-positive tumor cells represent the cellular
population that confers glioma radioresistance and could be the source
of tumor recurrence after radiation. Targeting DNA damage checkpoint
response in cancer stem cells may overcome this radioresistance and
provide a therapeutic model for malignant brain cancers.

Piccirillo et al. (2006) reported that bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs),
among which BMP4 (112262) elicits the strongest effect, trigger a
significant reduction in the stem-like, tumor-initiating precursors of
human glioblastomas. They demonstrated that BMPs activate their cognate
receptor BMPRs and trigger the SMAD (see 601595) signaling cascade in
cells isolated from human glioblastomas. This is followed by a reduction
in proliferation, and increased expression of markers of neural
differentiation, with no effect on cell viability. The concomitant
reduction in clonogenic ability, in the size of the CD133-positive
population, and in the growth kinetics of glioblastoma cells indicated
that BMP4 reduces the tumor-initiating cell pool of glioblastomas.

Using a transgenic mouse model in which endogenous Cd133 promoters drove
expression of a reporter gene, as well as immunodetection studies in
mouse and human tissues, Shmelkov et al. (2008) showed that CD133 was
expressed not only on metastatic colon cancer cells, but also on
differentiated colonic epithelium in both adult mice and humans. Both
CD133-positive and CD133-negative human metastatic tumor subpopulations
formed colonospheres in vitro and tumors in immunodeficient mice.
Shmelkov et al. (2008) proposed that not only are CD133-negative cells
more aggressive cancer-initiating cells than CD133-positive cells, but
that CD133-positive cells may actually give rise to the CD133-negative
subset.

In immunoprecipitation studies in mice, Yang et al. (2008) demonstrated
that PROM1 interacts with protocadherin-21 (PCDH21; 609502) and with
actin filaments, both of which play critical roles in photoreceptor disc
membrane morphogenesis.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Maw et al. (2000) performed molecular genetic analysis on an Indian
pedigree segregating for autosomal recessive retinal degeneration (RP41;
612095) and identified homozygosity for 1-bp deletion in PROM1 gene
(604365.0001) in affected individuals.

In affected members of a consanguineous Pakistani family with severe
retinitis pigmentosa, Zhang et al. (2007) identified homozygosity for a
nonsense mutation in the PROM1 gene (604365.0002).

Yang et al. (2008) screened 12 candidate genes in 2 families with
retinal disease mapping to chromosome 4p, 1 with a Stargardt-like
phenotype (STGD4; 603786) and 1 with retinal macular dystrophy-2 (MCDR2;
608051), and identified a missense mutation in the PROM1 gene in
affected members of both families (R373C; 608051.0003). The authors also
identified the R373C mutation in affected members of a family with
cone-rod dystrophy (CORD12; 612657). The mutation, which was not found
in 400 matched controls, was shown to cause mislocalization of mutant
and wildtype protein in the photoreceptor layers of mice and to be
associated with defective disc morphogenesis.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using an inducible Cre-nuclear LacZ reporter allele knocked into the
Prom1 locus (Prom1(C-L)) Zhu et al. (2009) demonstrated that Prom1 is
expressed in a variety of developing and adult tissues. Lineage-tracing
studies of adult Prom1(C-L) heterozygous mice containing the Rosa26-YFP
reporter allele showed that Prom1-positive cells are located at the base
of crypts in the small intestine, coexpress Lgr5 (606667), generate the
entire intestinal epithelium, and are therefore the small intestinal
stem cell. Prom1 was reported to mark cancer stem cells of human
intestinal tumors that arise frequently as a consequence of aberrant Wnt
signaling. Activation of endogenous Wnt signaling in Prom1(C-L)
heterozygous mice containing a Cre-dependent mutant allele of
beta-catenin (116806) resulted in a gross disruption of crypt
architecture and a disproportionate expansion of Prom1 positive cells at
the crypt base. Lineage tracing demonstrated that the progeny of these
cells replaced the mucosa of the entire small intestine with neoplastic
tissue that was characterized by focal high grade intraepithelial
neoplasia and crypt adenoma formation. Although all neoplastic cells
arose from Prom1-positive cells in these mice, only 7% of tumor cells
retained Prom1 expression. Zhu et al. (2009) concluded that Prom1 marks
stem cells in the adult small intestine that are susceptible to
transformation into tumors retaining a fraction of mutant Prom1-positive
tumor cells.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
RETINITIS PIGMENTOSA 41
PROM1, 1-BP DEL, 1878G

In 4 affected members of a consanguineous Indian family with retinal
degeneration (RP41; 612095), Maw et al. (2000) identified homozygosity
for a 1-bp deletion (1878delG) in exon 16 of the PROM1 gene, predicted
to cause a frameshift at codon 614 and a prematurely truncated protein
lacking about half of the second extracellular loop, the final
membrane-spanning segment, and the cytoplasmic C-terminal domain. The
mutation was not found in 97 Indian controls. A similar PROM1 deletion
mutant expressed in CHO cells did not reach the cell surface, and
immunocytochemistry showed that PROM1 was concentrated in the plasma
membrane evaginations at the base of the outer segments of rod
photoreceptors. Maw et al. (2000) suggested that loss of prominin causes
retinal degeneration, possibly because of impaired generation of the
evaginations and/or impaired conversion of the evaginations to discs.

.0002
RETINITIS PIGMENTOSA 41
PROM1, GLN576TER

In all 6 affected members of a consanguineous Pakistani family with
severe retinitis pigmentosa (RP41; 612095), Zhang et al. (2007)
identified homozygosity for a 1726C-T transition in exon 15 of the PROM1
gene, resulting in a gln576-to-ter (Q576X) substitution. Five of 6
unaffected family members were heterozygous for the mutation, which was
not found in 192 ethnically matched unrelated controls from the same
region.

.0003
STARGARDT DISEASE 4
MACULAR DYSTROPHY, RETINAL, 2, INCLUDED;;
CONE-ROD DYSTROPHY 12, INCLUDED
PROM1, ARG373CYS

In affected members of a family with a Stargardt-like phenotype (STGD4;
603786), previously described by Kniazeva et al. (1999), and an
unrelated family with retinal macular dystrophy-2 (MCDR2; 608051),
previously reported by Michaelides et al. (2003), Yang et al. (2008)
identified heterozygosity for a 1117C-T transition in exon 10 of the
PROM1 gene, resulting in an arg373-to-cys (R373C) substitution. The
authors also identified the R373C mutation in affected members of a
family with cone-rod dystrophy (CORD12; 612657). Haplotype analysis
indicated that the mutation had arisen independently in each of the 3
families, and it was not found in 400 matched controls. Studies in
transgenic mice showed both mutant and endogenous PROM1 throughout the
layers of the photoreceptors, rather than at the base of the
photoreceptor outer segments where PROM1 is normally localized, and the
outer segment disc membranes were greatly overgrown and misplaced,
indicating defective disc morphogenesis.

Michaelides et al. (2010) examined affected members of 5 families with
the R373C mutation in the PROM1 gene, including 3 previously studied
families (Kniazeva et al., 1999, Michaelides et al., 2003, and Yang et
al., 2008, respectively) and 2 newly ascertained British families in
which affected individuals had bull's eye macular dystrophy (families
'D' and 'E'). The authors observed that the R373C mutation produces an
autosomal dominant, fully penetrant retinopathy characterized by the
consistent finding of bull's-eye maculopathy, with variable rod or
rod-cone dysfunction displaying marked intra- and interfamilial
variability, and phenotypes ranging from isolated maculopathy without
generalized photoreceptor dysfunction to maculopathy associated with
very severe rod-cone dysfunction. Michaelides et al. (2010) noted that
all reported patients with the R373C mutation exhibited only an ocular
phenotype, despite ubiquitous expression of PROM1 in plasma membrane
protrusions.

107710	TITLE *107710 APOLIPOPROTEIN C-I; APOC1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Tata et al. (1985) synthesized a mixed oligonucleotide 17 bases long and
used it to isolate cDNA clones for apoC-I from an adult liver cDNA
library.

MAPPING

Tata et al. (1985) used a probe and Southern blot techniques to identify
the human APOC1 gene in the DNA of various human-rodent cell hybrids.
Their results assigned the gene to chromosome 19.

By the study of somatic cell hybrids containing rearranged chromosome
19, Scott et al. (1985) concluded that the chromosome 19 cluster of
apolipoprotein genes probably lies in the 19p13-19cen region. (HGM8
placed the cluster in the 19cen-19q13 region.) Davison et al. (1986)
showed that there are 2 APOC1 sequences on chromosome 19 and that 1 of
them is 4 kb 3-prime to apolipoprotein E (APOE; 107741) and oriented in
the same way as APOE. One APOC1 gene appeared to be a pseudogene because
no mRNA product could be detected in any tissue (Lauer et al., 1988).
There are 2 APOC1 mRNA transcripts, but these may be the consequence of
differential processing of a single primary transcript.

Lusis et al. (1986) used a reciprocal whole arm translocation between
the long arm of chromosome 19 and the short arm of chromosome 1 to
determine that the APOC1, APOC2, APOE and GPI loci are on the long arm
and the LDLR, C3 and PEPD loci on the short arm. They isolated a single
lambda phage carrying APOC1 and part of APOE. These genes are 6 kb apart
and arranged tandemly. APOC2 and APOE were previously shown to be
tightly linked. Studying a cDNA APOC1 clone and a genomic APOE clone,
Myklebost and Rogne (1986) concluded that the loci are 4.3 kb apart. By
comparison, on chromosome 11, APOA1 (107680) is 2.6 kb from APOC3
(107720). Using separate probes for each locus, Bailey and Miller (1987)
mapped APOC2 and APOE to 19q13.1 at the border of q12 by in situ
hybridization.

Smit et al. (1988) presented a map of the apolipoprotein E-C1-C2 gene
cluster on chromosome 19: 5-prime--APOE--4.3 kb--APOC1--6 kb--APOC1
pseudogene--about 22 kb--APOC2--3-prime. Thus, the cluster spans
approximately 48 kb. This gene order and the size of the cluster were
confirmed by Myklebost and Rogne (1988) by pulsed-field gel
electrophoresis mapping methods. A HpaI RFLP in the APOE-C1-C2 gene
cluster on chromosome 19 is strongly associated with familial
dysbetalipoproteinemia. Smit et al. (1988) showed that this RFLP site is
between APOE and APOC1 and specifically that it is located 317 bp
upstream of the transcription initiation site of the APOC1 gene. They
constructed a detailed restriction map of the gene cluster, showing that
the APOC2 gene is located 15 kb downstream of the APOC1 pseudogene.
Although Trask et al. (1993) did not map the APOC1 gene directly, the
mapping of the APOE and APOC2 genes to 19q13.2 by fluorescence in situ
hybridization established that the APOC1 gene is also in this band.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Age-associated memory impairment (AAMI) is a designation used to define
the nondemented elderly with subjective and objective memory impairment
presenting no medical or other psychopathologic conditions that could
explain the memory problems (Crook et al., 1986). Bartres-Faz et al.
(2001) noted that it was controversial whether AAMI described a subgroup
of normally aging subjects or, on the other hand, whether these
individuals presented particular characteristics distinguishable from
controls or an intermediate stage between normal aging and dementia.
Because an association between an APOE polymorphism (APOE*E4;
107741.0016) and late-onset Alzheimer disease (104310) had been
convincingly confirmed in several reports, they studied the distribution
of genetic polymorphisms in the APOE and APOC1 genes in a sample of 100
subjects fulfilling the National Institute of Mental Health criteria for
age-associated memory impairment and in 124 controls. They found
significant associations for both APOE and APOC1 and their combinations
with the AAMI condition.

ANIMAL MODEL

To determine the relationship between APOC1 and CETP (118470), Gautier
et al. (2002) crossed transgenic mice expressing human CETP with Apoc1
null mice. The high density lipoproteins (HDLs) of these crosses
contained 50% less cholesteryl esters and showed a decreased cholesteryl
ester-to-triglyceride ratio. The mean apparent diameter of LDLs from
these mice was also significantly reduced. In vitro, purified Apoc1
inhibited cholesteryl ester exchange when added to either total plasma
or to reconstituted HDL-free mixtures. Gautier et al. (2002) concluded
that APOC1 is a specific inhibitor of CETP.

Jong et al. (1999) found that adenovirus-delivery of LDLR (606945) to
transgenic mice overexpressing Apoc1 resulted in decreased plasma lipid
levels. Infection with VLDLR (192977) had no effect. These results,
coupled with in vitro binding studies, suggested that APOC1 inhibits the
clearance of lipoprotein particles via VLDLR, but APOC1-enriched
lipoproteins can still bind to LDLR.

607696	TITLE *607696 USH1G GENE; USH1G
;;SCAFFOLD PROTEIN CONTAINING ANKYRIN REPEATS AND SAM DOMAIN; SANS
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By positional cloning, Kikkawa et al. (2003) identified a novel gene
within the 72-kb region on mouse chromosome 11 containing the Jackson
shaker (js) locus. Kikkawa et al. (2003) named the gene Sans because it
was found to encode a scaffold protein containing ankyrin repeats and a
SAM (sterile alpha motif) domain. Kikkawa et al. (2003) determined that
the mouse protein is expressed in the cochlea (including inner and outer
hair cells), cerebellum, eye, and testis.

Weil et al. (2003) cloned the human homolog of the mouse Sans gene in
silico by database mining. The deduced 460-amino acid protein contains 3
ankyrin-like domains near the N terminus, a central region, and a SAM
domain and a PDZ-binding motif at the C terminus. The human protein
shares 96% sequence identity with the mouse protein.

GENE FUNCTION

Weil et al. (2003) found by cotransfection experiments that SANS
interacts with harmonin (USH1C; 605242), which is mutant in Usher
syndrome type IC (276904). The authors proposed that SANS is an integral
part of the protein complex linking cadherin (CDH23; 605516) stereocilia
laterally to the stereocilia microfilaments. CDH23 is mutant in Usher
syndrome type ID (USH1D; 601067)

By using cotransfection and immunolocalization techniques, Adato et al.
(2005) documented the interaction between SANS and harmonin, and also
determined that SANS binds to myosin VIIa (MYO7A; 276903). The authors
noted that SANS formed homomeric structures. SANS was localized to the
apical region of cochlear and vestibular hair cell bodies underneath the
cuticular plate. In contrast to the other 4 known USH1 proteins, no SANS
labeling was detected within the stereocilia. Adato et al. (2005)
proposed that via its binding to myosin VIIa and/or harmonin, SANS
controls the hair bundle cohesion and proper development by regulating
the traffic of USH1 proteins en route to the stereocilia.

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Maerker et al. (2008) found that the C
terminus of human SANS interacted with the N-terminal region of whirlin
(WHRN; 607928) in a bovine retina cDNA library. In mouse retina, both
proteins colocalized at synapses in the outer plexiform layer and in the
outer limiting membrane, the inner segment, and the ciliary region of
photoreceptor cells. Within the ciliary region, high resolution analysis
revealed that Sans and whirlin colocalized in the connecting cilium and
basal body complex. Maerker et al. (2008) showed that Sans provided a
link to the microtubule transport machinery, whereas whirlin appeared to
anchor 2 retinal transmembrane proteins, Ush2a (608400) isoform b and
Vlgr1b (GPR98; 602851), to specific membrane domains. Maerker et al.
(2008) concluded that this network of proteins may cooperate to regulate
cargo transfer from inner segment transport carriers to the ciliary
transport system of photoreceptors.

GENE STRUCTURE

Weil et al. (2003) determined that the human SANS gene spans over 7.2 kb
and contains 3 exons, 2 of which are coding.

MAPPING

Kikkawa et al. (2003) identified the Sans gene within the critical
region of the Jackson shaker mouse mutation on chromosome 10. This
region shows syntenic homology with a region of human chromosome 17 to
which the Usher syndrome type IG (USH1G; 606943) locus had been mapped
(17q24-q25). By sequence analysis, Weil et al. (2003) identified the
SANS gene on chromosome 17 between markers D17S1807 and D17S1839.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Wu et al. (2011) reported the crystal structure of the MyTH4-FERM
domains of MYO7A in complex with the central domain (CEN) of SANS at
2.8-angstrom resolution. The MyTH4 and FERM domains form an integral
structural and functional supramodule binding to 2 highly conserved
segments (CEN1 and 2) of SANS. Wu et al. (2011) concluded that the
MyTH4-FERM/CEN complex structure provides mechanistic explanations for
known deafness-causing mutations in MYO7A MyTH4-FERM.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of a large Tunisian family segregating Usher
syndrome type IG (606943), Weil et al. (2003) identified a mutation in
the SANS gene (607696.0004). They identified different mutations in the
SANS gene in affected members of German and Jordanian families (see
607696.0001-607696.0003).

ANIMAL MODEL

The Jackson shaker mouse carries a recessive mutation causing the
phenotype of deafness, abnormal behavior (circling and/or head tossing)
and degeneration of inner ear neuroepithelia (Kitamura et al., 1992).
Kikkawa et al. (2003) noted that 2 alleles had been identified, the
original js and jsseal. They determined that the Sans gene contains
insertion mutations in both js and jsseal mutant alleles. Both mutations
are predicted to inactivate the Sans protein by creating frameshift
mutations, resulting in a truncated protein lacking the C-terminal SAM
domain. Cochlear hair cells in the js mutants showed disorganized
stereocilia bundles. Sans was shown by in situ hybridization to be
highly expressed in both inner and outer hair cells of cochlea. Kikkawa
et al. (2003) suggested that the existence of major motifs, ankyrin
repeats and a SAM domain, supported an important role for Sans in the
development and maintenance of the stereocilia bundles, possibly via
protein-protein interactions.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
USHER SYNDROME, TYPE IG
USH1G, LEU48PRO

In 2 German brothers with Usher syndrome type IG (606943), Weil et al.
(2003) identified compound heterozygosity for mutations in the SANS
gene. One mutation was a 142C-T transition in exon 1, predicting a
substitution of proline for a relatively conserved leucine at position
48 (L48P) in the first ankyrin domain. The other mutation was a
dinucleotide deletion in exon 2, 186delCA, predicted to produce a
truncated 132 amino acid protein containing 70 missense C-terminal
residues.

See 607696.0001 and Weil et al. (2003).

.0003
USHER SYNDROME, TYPE IG
USH1G, 20-BP DEL, NT829

In affected members of a consanguineous Jordanian family segregating
Usher syndrome type IG (606943), Weil et al. (2003) identified
homozygosity for a 20-bp deletion (nucleotides 829-848) in exon 2 of the
SANS gene, predicting a truncated 326-amino acid protein containing 70
missense C-terminal residues and lacking the SAM domain.

.0004
USHER SYNDROME, TYPE IG
USH1G, 1-BP INS, 393G

In affected members of a consanguineous Tunisian family segregating
Usher syndrome type IG (606943), Weil et al. (2003) identified
homozygosity for a 393G insertion in exon 2 of the SANS gene, predicting
a truncated 133-amino acid protein lacking the central region and the
C-terminal SAM domain.

.0005
USHER SYNDROME, TYPE IG
USH1G, TRP38TER

In a mutation screen of Usher syndrome type I (606943) patients from the
U.S. and the U.K., Ouyang et al. (2005) found homozygosity for a 113G-A
transition in the USH1G gene, resulting in a trp38-to-ter (W38X)
substitution in the first ankyrin domain of the SANS protein. The
mutation would result in a truncated protein lacking approximately 90%
of the predicted coding sequence. Ouyang et al. (2005) found the
mutation in 2 of 59 (3.4%) probands from the U.S.

.0006
USHER SYNDROME, TYPE IG, MILD
USH1G, 15-BP DEL, NT163

In 4 affected members of a consanguineous Pakistani family with Usher
syndrome type IG (606943), Bashir et al. (2010) identified a homozygous
15-bp deletion (163_164+13del15) involving nucleotides in the first exon
and intron of the USH1G gene. The mutation was not found in 200 control
chromosomes. Investigation of the effect of the mutation was hampered
because RNA from patient blood did not show sufficient expression of
SANS. In silico analysis predicted that retention of the first intron in
the RNA resulting from the mutation would introduce a frameshift and
premature termination, which could result in nonsense-mediated mRNA
decay. However, if the mRNA is processed, the frameshift would result in
a truncated nonfunctional protein of 58 amino acids. The patients had an
atypical form of Usher syndrome, with moderate to severe hearing loss,
normal vestibular function, and lack of eyesight problems. However,
funduscopy showed mild symptoms of retinitis pigmentosa and pale optic
discs in 3 of the older affected patients at ages 13, 15, and 22 years,
respectively. The findings indicated that even a truncating mutation in
the USH1G gene can result in a relatively mild phenotype.

602474	TITLE *602474 PROTEIN KINASE, MEMBRANE-ASSOCIATED TYROSINE/THREONINE, 1; PKMYT1
;;CDC2-INHIBITORY KINASE, MEMBRANE-ASSOCIATED TYROSINE/THREONINE, 1;
MYT1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Entry into mitosis requires the activity of CDC2 kinase (116940) coupled
with cyclin B. Phosphorylation of the CDC2 protein on residues threonine
14 and tyrosine 15 is inhibitory to CDC2 activity. Using a PCR-based
approach, Liu et al. (1997) cloned a novel kinase, which they termed
MYT1 for 'membrane-associated tyrosine- and threonine-specific
cdc2-inhibitory kinase', that phosphorylates CDC2 on both threonine 14
and tyrosine 15. Preferentially, MYT1 phosphorylates CDC2 on threonine
14 in a cyclin-dependent manner. The MYT1 cDNA encodes a predicted
499-amino acid polypeptide with a molecular mass of 55 kD. Liu et al.
(1997) found that the protein localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum and
Golgi complex in HeLa cells.

NOMENCLATURE

Although Liu et al. (1997) designated this gene MYT1, this symbol had
already been assigned to the myelin transcription factor-1 gene
(600379).

128260	TITLE *128260 SMALL NUCLEAR RIBONUCLEOPROTEIN POLYPEPTIDE E; SNRPE
;;E PROTEIN OF SMALL NUCLEAR RIBONUCLEOPROTEIN COMPLEXES
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SNRPE encodes a core protein of U snRNPs, the key factors of the
pre-mRNA processing spliceosome (summary by Pasternack et al., 2013).

CLONING

Many patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (152700) circulate Sm
autoantibodies directed against a broad range of small nuclear
ribonucleoprotein complexes (snRNPs). One of the proteins recognized by
some anti-Sm sera is the 11,000-Da E protein. This protein is 1 of 4
'core' proteins associated with all known snRNAs in the U family (U1,
U2, U4, U5, and U6) (Wieben et al., 1985; Stanford et al., 1987).

Stanford et al. (1988) gave the complete nucleotide sequence. The
longest open reading frame coded for a basic 92-amino acid protein that
had an amino acid sequence in perfect agreement with that obtained from
purified E protein.

After RT-PCR, Pasternack et al. (2013) performed semiquantitative PCR
and found that SNRPE is expressed ubiquitously, including in skin and
hair follicle cells. Immunohistochemistry revealed SNRPE in the nuclei
of all cells of the hair follicle, the epidermis, and the dermis. An
identical pattern of SNRPE immunoreactivity was observed in dorsal skin
of 9-day-old C57BL/6J mice.

GENE STRUCTURE

The gene for the E protein is 9 kb long and contains 5 exons. The
sequence is known for 9 closely related genes that have several features
of processed pseudogenes (Neiswanger et al., 1988).

MAPPING

Neiswanger et al. (1988, 1990) mapped the E protein gene to 1q32 by a
combination of somatic cell and in situ hybridization. Neiswanger et al.
(1990) corroborated the assignment by genetic linkage to markers in the
region of 1q32. They noted that at least one of the SNRPE pseudogenes is
linked to a signal transduction G protein gene (139380) that also maps
to chromosome 1. Two other small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP)
components--the U1 RNA 'true' multigene family (180680) and a group of
class I U1 pseudogenes--are located on chromosome 1. A U2 snRNA gene
cluster (RNU2; 180690) is located on chromosome 17, whereas chromosome
19 encodes the U1-specific 70K protein (180740).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of a 4-generation Spanish family and 2 sporadic
patients with hypotrichosis (HYPT11; 615059), Pasternack et al. (2013)
identified heterozygosity for 2 different mutations in the SNRPE gene
(128260.0001 and 128260.0002, respectively). Subcellular localization of
mutant SNRPE by immunofluorescence analyses as well as incorporation of
mutant SNRPE proteins into U snRPSs was normal, suggesting the variants
alter the function of U snRNPs in splicing rather than their biogenesis.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HYPOTRICHOSIS 11
SNRPE, 1A-G

In affected members of a 4-generation Spanish family with hypotrichosis
(HYPT11; 615059), previously reported by Just et al., 1998), and an
unrelated 12-year-old British girl, Pasternack et al. (2013) identified
heterozygosity for a 1A-G transition in the SNRPE gene, altering the
start codon (MET1) of the gene. The mutation segregated with disease in
both families and was not found in 880 German or 598 Spanish control
chromosomes, or in the dbSNP or 1000 Genomes databases. Western blot
analyses of HEK293T cells expressing SNRPE 1A-G revealed an N-terminally
truncated protein, suggesting that the mutation might result in use of
an alternative in-frame downstream start codon.

.0002
HYPOTRICHOSIS 11
SNRPE, GLY45SER

In an 8-year-old Tunisian boy with hypotrichosis (HYPT11; 615059),
Pasternack et al. (2013) identified heterozygosity for a 133G-A
transition in the SNRPE gene, resulting in a gly45-to-ser (G45S)
substitution at a highly conserved residue in the Sm motif 1. His
parents were reported to be unaffected but were not available for
analysis. The mutation was not found in 880 German control chromosomes
or 598 Spanish control chromosomes, and was not present in the dbSNP or
the 1000 Genomes databases. Functional analysis in HEK293T cells showed
reduced incorporation of the mutant into U snRNP compared to wildtype.

603895	TITLE *603895 REGULATOR OF G PROTEIN SIGNALING 11; RGS11
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the RGS (regulator of G protein signaling) family act as
GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) on the alpha subunits of
heterotrimeric, signal-transducing G proteins. As such, RGS proteins can
serve as negative regulators of G protein-mediated signaling pathways by
speeding the inactivation of GTP-bound G-alpha subunits.

CLONING

Snow et al. (1998) identified sequences encoding human RGS11 by database
searches. The predicted 467-amino acid human protein contains a DEP
(Dishevelled, EGL-10, pleckstrin) domain and an RGS domain. In addition,
sequence analysis revealed that RGS11, RGS6 (603894), RGS7 (602517),
RGS9, and C. elegans EGL-10 all contain a conserved 64-amino acid region
that the authors called a GGL (G protein gamma subunit-like) domain
because of its similarity to G protein gamma subunits (see 600874). In
vitro, the GGL domains of RGS11 and RGS7 interact preferentially with
the G protein beta-5 subunit. Coexpression of RGS11 with different
G-beta subunits indicated that RGS11 interacted specifically with
G-beta-5 in mammalian cells. The G-beta-5/RGS11 heterodimer acted as a
GAP on G-0-alpha (139311) in vitro. Northern blot analysis revealed that
RGS11 and G-beta-5 are expressed in overlapping patterns, with the
highest levels of RGS11 mRNA observed in brain and retina.

GENE STRUCTURE

Sierra et al. (2002) determined that the RGS11 gene contains 16 exons
and spans 8.1 kb.

MAPPING

By inclusion within mapped clones, Snow et al. (1998) mapped the RGS11
gene to 16p13.3.

609722	TITLE *609722 PDZ AND LIM DOMAIN PROTEIN 2; PDLIM2
;;MYSTIQUE;;
STAT-INTERACTING LIM PROTEIN; SLIM
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Torrado et al. (2004) cloned rat Pdlim2 from eye total RNA. They
identified human PDLIM2 clones in retina, lens, retinal pigment
epithelium/choroid, and fetal eye cDNA libraries. Northern blot analysis
detected high expression in rat cornea and lower expression in sclera,
lung, and combined trabecular meshwork, iris, and ciliary body. No
expression was detected in retina. In situ hybridization of rat eye
tissues detected Pdlim2 in corneal epithelial cells, but not in corneal
stroma or endothelium or in other ocular tissues.

By searching a database for sequences similar to mouse Mystique,
followed by RT-PCR of breast cancer cell line mRNA, Loughran et al.
(2005) cloned 3 human Mystique variants that they called Mystique-1, -2,
and -3. The deduced proteins contain 366, 352, and 278 amino acids and
have calculated molecular masses of 39.2, 37.5, and 29.1 kD,
respectively. Mystique-1 and -2 have an N-terminal PDZ domain and a
C-terminal LIM domain separated by about 200 amino acids, but they
differ at their C termini. Mystique-3 has only the PDZ domain due to the
absence of exon 9 and introduction of a premature stop codon. RT-PCR
suggested there may be 2 additional human Mystique splice variants.
Northern blot analysis of mouse tissues showed tissue-specific
expression of 3 Mystique splice variants. Mystique-2 was the predominant
transcript in most tissues and was highly expressed in lung. Transient
expression of the 3 human cDNAs in HeLa cells showed Mystique-1 and -2
predominantly localized at the cytoskeleton and Mystique-3 localized
predominantly in the nucleus and more weakly near the cytoskeleton.
Western blot analysis detected endogenous Mystique-2 at an apparent
molecular mass of 37.5 kD in 3 of 5 human cell lines examined; other
Mystique isoforms were not detected. Mystique-2 colocalized with
alpha-actinin (see ACTN1; 102575) and beta-1-integrin (ITGB1; 135630) in
breast cancer cells.

By yeast 2-hybrid screening of a mouse Th1 clone cDNA library using the
N-terminal 133 amino acids of mouse Stat4 (600558) as bait, Tanaka et
al. (2005) isolated Pdlim2, which they called Slim. The predicted
349-amino acid mouse Slim protein has an N-terminal PDZ domain and a
C-terminal LIM domain. Northern blot analysis of mouse tissues detected
highest expression of Slim in lung, with strong expression in spleen and
thymus as well. Slim was highly expressed in primary mouse Cd4
(186940)-positive T cells, Cd8 (see 186910)-positive T cells, B cells,
macrophages, and dendritic cells. Western blot analysis showed that Slim
was present in nuclear but not cytoplasmic extracts of primary
Cd4-positive T cells both before and after stimulation with Il12 (see
161560).

GENE FUNCTION

Torrado et al. (2004) found that Pdlim2 coimmunoprecipitated with Actn1,
Actn4 (604638), filamin A (FLNA; 300017), and myosin heavy polypeptide-9
(MYH9; 160775) in rat corneal and lung extracts. Myosin VI (MYO6;
600970) coimmunoprecipitated with Pdlim2 from corneal but not lung
extracts. Alpha-actinins were the most abundant immunoprecipitated
proteins. Pull-down assays and gel overlay assays with purified proteins
confirmed direct interaction of Pdlim2 with alpha-actinins and filamin.
Pdlim2 and alpha-actinins colocalized mainly to stress fibers after
transfection into COS-7 cells, and complexes of Pdlim2 and Actn1
preferentially located along the basal aspect.

Loughran et al. (2005) found that expression of human Mystique-2 was
induced by IGF1 (147440) and cell adhesion. Overexpression of Mystique-2
in a breast cancer cell line suppressed anchorage-independent growth and
enhanced cell adhesion to collagen (see 120150) and fibronectin (FN1;
135600). Point mutation within either the PDZ and LIM domains reversed
the growth suppression, whereas mutation of the PDZ domain alone
abolished the enhancement of cell adhesion. Knockdown of Mystique-2 with
small interfering RNA abrogated both adhesion and migration in 2 breast
cancer cell lines. Loughran et al. (2005) concluded that Mystique is an
IGF1R (147370)-regulated adaptor protein located at the actin
cytoskeleton that is necessary for epithelial cell migration.

By yeast 2-hybrid, coimmunoprecipitation, and Western blot analyses,
Tanaka et al. (2005) showed that mouse Slim interacted with
tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat4. Cotransfection analysis revealed that
Slim impaired Stat-mediated gene expression and that Slim possessed
ubiquitin E3 ligase activity. Immunoblot analysis also showed that Slim
promoted degradation and dephosphorylation of Stat4. Slim -/-
Cd4-positive mouse T cells showed enhanced Ifng (147570) production, and
Slim -/- mice had an enhanced inflammatory response in liver to
heat-killed Listeria monocytogenes and higher levels of Stat1 (600555)
and Stat4 proteins compared with wildtype mice. Tanaka et al. (2005)
concluded that SLIM regulates both the level of STAT protein expression
and the extent of STAT activation, and thus the amount of IFNG produced
following CD4-positive T-cell stimulation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Loughran et al. (2005) determined that the PDLIM2 gene contains 12 exons
and spans about 20 kb. The translation start codon is in exon 2.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Loughran et al. (2005) mapped the PDLIM2
gene to chromosome 8p21.2.

ANIMAL MODEL

Tanaka et al. (2005) found that Slim -/- mice were healthy and fertile.
Slim -/- mice showed enhanced Ifng production by Cd4-positive T cells,
enhanced inflammatory response in liver to heat-killed Listeria
monocytogenes, and higher levels of Stat proteins compared with wildtype
mice.

194533	TITLE *194533 ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 35; ZNF35
;;ZINC FINGER PROTEIN HF.10; HF10
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Zinc fingers are protein DNA-binding domains that consist of tandemly
repeated units of 28 to 30 amino acids containing 2 cysteine and 2
histidine residues at invariant positions. The finger motif has been
identified in several eukaryotic transcriptional regulatory proteins and
members of the finger-gene family are implicated in both proliferation
and differentiation of normal cells. By means of hybridization with a
finger motif-containing DNA probe, Donti et al. (1990) identified
several human finger genes, one of which, HF.10, is expressed at low
levels in a variety of human tissues and is downregulated during the in
vitro terminal differentiation of human leukemic myeloid cell lines.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lanfrancone et al. (1992) reported that the ZNF35 gene spans about 13 kb
and is interrupted by 3 introns. All 11 zinc finger DNA-binding domains
are contiguously encoded within the last 3-prime exon.

MAPPING

Using in situ hybridization, Lanfrancone et al. (1992) showed that both
the functional ZNF35 locus and a processed pseudogene map to chromosome
3p22-p21, a region that is frequently deleted in small cell lung cancer
and renal carcinoma. Both the functional gene and the pseudogene were
deleted in a case of small cell lung carcinoma with 3p deletion.

By in situ hybridization and by analysis of interspecific somatic cell
hybrids, Donti et al. (1990) mapped the HF10 gene to 3p22-p21, a
chromosome region frequently involved in karyotypic changes associated
with lung and renal cancer. Hoovers et al. (1992) also assigned zinc
finger protein genes to 3p.

Calabro et al. (1995) isolated 3 new genes encoding zinc finger proteins
from a YAC contig of 3p22-p21 by using a cDNA hybridization selection.
They took this to indicate a clustering of zinc finger protein genes in
3p21.

611331	TITLE *611331 SMALL NUCLEOLAR RNA, H/ACA BOX, 74B; SNORA74B
;;snoRNA, U19-2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs involved in RNA
processing. Box H/ACA snoRNAs, such as SNORA74B, direct the conversion
of uridine to pseudouridine at specific residues of ribosomal RNAs or
small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) (Gu et al., 2005).

CLONING

By RT-PCR of human blood total RNA, Gu et al. (2005) identified several
box H/ACA snoRNAs, including SNORA74B, which they called U19-2. U19-2
contains 204 nucleotides and has 3 isoforms.

GENE FUNCTION

Based on sequence complementarity, Gu et al. (2005) predicted that U19-2
directs pseudouridylation of U3731 and U3733 of 28S ribosomal RNA (see
180450).

MAPPING

Gu et al. (2005) mapped the SNORA74B gene to chromosome 5, within intron
3 of the ATP6V0E1 gene (603931).

608453	TITLE *608453 CAS-BR-M MURINE ECOTROPIC RETROVIRAL TRANSFORMING SEQUENCE C; CBLC
;;CBL3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CBL proteins, such as CBLC, are phosphorylated upon activation of a
variety of receptors that signal via protein tyrosine kinases. Through
interactions with proteins containing SRC (190090) homology-2 (SH2) and
SH3 domains, CBL proteins modulate downstream cell signaling (Keane et
al., 1999).

CLONING

By searching an EST database for CBL-like sequences, followed by
screening a pancreas carcinoma cell line cDNA library and 5-prime RACE,
Keane et al. (1999) cloned CBLC, which they designated CBL3. The deduced
474-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 52.5 kD. CBLC
contains an N-terminal phosphotyrosine-binding domain, a conserved C3HC4
zinc finger motif, and a short proline-rich region near the C terminus.
CBLC lacks the extensive proline-rich domain and leucine zipper motif
found in CBL (165360) and CBLB (604491). Keane et al. (1999) also
identified a splice variant that encodes a protein with a 46-amino acid
deletion in the phosphotyrosine-binding domain; this protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 47.5 kD. Northern blot analysis detected a
1.7- to 2.0-kb transcript expressed at high levels in liver, pancreas,
small intestine, colon, prostate, and trachea. Low expression was
detected in stomach, lung, and thyroid, and no expression was detected
in hematopoietic tissues. RNA dot blot analysis detected low but
ubiquitous expression, with highest levels in adrenal gland and salivary
gland in addition to the tissues identified by Northern blot analysis.

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to CBL, followed by
screening a kidney cDNA library and oligo capping to extend the 5-prime
sequence, Kim et al. (1999) cloned CBLC. Northern blot analysis detected
a 2.0-kb transcript highly expressed in colon and small intestine.
Expression was also observed in pancreas, placenta, liver, kidney, and
prostate, but not in brain, testis, and lymphoid tissues. Minor
transcripts of 4.0 and 6.0 kb were also detected in several tissues.
Western blot analysis found that endogenous CBLC migrated with an
apparent molecular mass of 52 kD in colon carcinoma cell lines.

Griffiths et al. (2003) found that mouse Cblc was expressed in
epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal tract, the epidermis, and the
respiratory, urinary, and reproductive systems.

GENE FUNCTION

By in vitro protein binding assays, Keane et al. (1999) determined that
both the long (CBLC-L) and short (CBLC-S) forms of CBLC bound to
recombinant fusion proteins containing the SH3 domains of LYN (165120)
and CRK (164762), but not with any other SH3-containing proteins.
Following EGF (131530) stimulation of cotransfected embryonic kidney
cells, CBLC-L, but not CBLC-S, was phosphorylated and immunoprecipitated
with EGFR (131550). CBLC-L also inhibited EGF-induced stimulation of
transcription by ERK2 (MAPK1; 176948) in a dose-dependent manner. CBLC-S
had no effect on MAPK signaling.

Kim et al. (1999) transfected embryonic kidney cells with CBLC and EGFR.
The amount of EGFR that coimmunoprecipitated with CBLC increased
following EGF stimulation. In vitro binding assays showed that CBLC
bound to the SH3 domain, but not the SH2 domain, of FYN (137025), and it
bound to the SH3 domain of GRB2 (108355) and the p85 regulatory subunit
of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (171833). CBLC and FYN
coimmunoprecipitated in transfected embryonic kidney cells only when
both proteins were present.

GENE STRUCTURE

Nau and Lipkowitz (2003) determined that the CBLC gene contains 11 exons
and spans about 23 kb. The mouse Cblc gene contains 10 exons and lacks
the intron that exists between human exons 8 and 9.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid analysis and radiation hybrid analysis, Keane et
al. (1999) mapped the CBLC gene to chromosome 19q13.2. Using FISH, Kim
et al. (1999) mapped the CBLC gene to chromosome 19q13.2-q13.3. Southern
blot analysis indicated that CBLC is a single copy gene.

ANIMAL MODEL

Griffiths et al. (2003) found that Cblc-null mice were viable, healthy,
and fertile, and displayed no histologic abnormalities up to 18 months
of age. Proliferation of epithelial cells in the epidermis and
gastrointestinal tracts was unaffected by the loss of Cblc. Moreover,
Cblc was not required for attenuation of EGF-stimulated ERK activation
in primary keratinocytes.

605515	TITLE *605515 FORKHEAD BOX P1; FOXP1
;;GLUTAMINE-RICH FACTOR 1; QRF1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

FOXP1 is a transcriptional repressor that plays a critical role in
monocyte differentiation and macrophage function (Shi et al., 2008).

CLONING

Li and Tucker (1993) cloned a glutamine-rich factor, which they
designated QRF1, that was expressed preferentially at the terminal
differentiation stage of B cells and in skeletal muscle. The deduced
707-amino acid QRF1 protein contains an 84-amino acid segment that shows
significant sequence homology with the DNA-binding domains of the
hepatocyte nuclear factor-3/forkhead (see FOXA1; 602294) family of
proteins.

By expression cloning using blood and testis cDNA libraries to identify
the target of a monoclonal antibody (JC12), Banham et al. (2001)
obtained a full-length cDNA encoding FOXP1. The predicted 677-amino acid
protein contains coiled-coil, glutamine-rich, and serine/threonine-rich
domains in its N-terminal half; a central zinc finger domain; and
coiled-coil, serine/threonine/proline-rich, winged helix, and acidic
domains in its C-terminal half. FOXP1 also has numerous putative
phosphorylation sites, 2 nuclear localization signals (NLSs) in its
C-terminal half, and 2 PEST motif in its C-terminal acidic region.
Multiple-tissue array analysis showed ubiquitous expression of FOXP1 in
normal adult and fetal tissues, with highest expression in lymphoid and
gastrointestinal tissues. Immunohistochemistry showed that FOXP1 protein
was widely expressed, with a predominantly nuclear localization, in
normal tissues.

Wang et al. (2003) stated that there are 4 splice variants of mouse
Foxp1, designated Foxp1a through Foxp1d. They identified and cloned
Foxp1d, which encodes a Foxp1 isoform lacking the N-terminal
polyglutamine domain found in Foxp1a and Foxp1b. Northern blot analysis
and RNase protection assays showed tissue-specific expression of all 4
variants in mouse. Northern blot analysis of human tissues detected
tissue-specific expression of FOXP1 variants, with highest levels in
peripheral blood lymphocytes and in caudate nucleus of brain. Western
blot analysis detected variable expression of Foxp1a, Foxp1c, and Foxp1d
in mouse tissues, with high expression of all 3 isoforms in lung.

GENE FUNCTION

Wang et al. (2003) found that mouse Foxp1a, Foxp1c, Foxp1d, and the
related Foxp2 (605317) protein bound a 7-nucleotide core sequence,
TATTT(G/A)T. These Foxp proteins repressed gene transcription via
binding to this consensus site, which was identified within the SV40 and
IL2 (147680) promoters. In some cases, the strength of Foxp1 repression
was mediated by the polyglutamine domain. Mouse Foxp1 proteins also
formed homodimers or heterodimers with subfamily members, and the
conserved C2H2 zinc finger and leucine zipper motifs mediated
dimerization.

Using genetic manipulations, Rousso et al. (2008) demonstrated that
Foxp1 established the pattern of LIM-homeodomain protein (see 601999)
expression in embryonic mice and, accordingly, organized motor axon
projections, their connectivity with peripheral targets, and the
establishment of motor pools. Hox proteins (see 142950) dictated the
pattern of Foxp1 expression in spinal cord, and both Foxp1 and Hox were
required for segment-appropriate generation of motor columns and pools
in mouse.

Shi et al. (2008) generated transgenic mice overexpressing human FOXP1
in monocyte/macrophage lineage cells. Circulating blood monocytes from
these mice had reduced expression of macrophage colony-stimulating
factor receptor (CSF1R; 164770), impaired migratory capacity, and
diminished accumulation as splenic macrophages. Macrophage functions
were globally impaired, and osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption were
attenuated. Forced overexpression of Csf1r reversed many of the
deficits, suggesting that repression of Csf1r is likely the dominant
mechanism responsible for FOXP1 effects on monocyte differentiation and
macrophage function.

- Association of FOXP1 With Cancer

By analysis of a tumor/normal tissue expression array, Banham et al.
(2001) found that expression of FOXP1 was lower in colon tumors and
higher in stomach and prostate tumors compared with matched normal
tissues. Immunohistochemical analysis showed frequent loss of
expression, increased expression, and cytoplasmic mislocalization of the
predominantly nuclear FOXP1 protein in solid tumors.

By immunohistochemical analysis of a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (BCL)
tissue microarray, Banham et al. (2005) found that untreated patients
with a high percentage of FOXP1-positive nuclei had significantly
reduced survival and earlier progression compared with FOXP1-negative
patients.

Of 275 BCLs, Haralambieva et al. (2005) found that only 5 (3
gastrointestinal, 1 thyroid, and 1 cervical lymph node) carried a
chromosomal breakpoint in the FOXP1 gene and strong nuclear FOXP1
expression. All were diffuse large BCLs rather than marginal zone BCLs.
Haralambieva et al. (2005) concluded that genetic alterations at 3p13
are associated with strong FOXP1 expression.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Banham et al. (2001) mapped the FOXP1 gene
to chromosome 3p14.1.

CYTOGENETICS

Streubel et al. (2005) noted that 3 chromosomal translocations,
t(11;18)(q21;q21), t(14;18)(q32;q21), and t(1;14)(p22;q32), are
associated with mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas. They
identified a t(3;14)(p14;q32) in a case of MALT lymphoma of the thyroid.
FISH studies showed that the IGH locus (147100) was rearranged, and
long-distance inverse PCR identified FOXP1 as the partner gene on
chromosome 3. Using FISH assays to screen 91 MALT lymphomas negative for
3 common translocations, Streubel et al. (2005) identified
t(3;14)(p14;q32) in 9 cases (3 thyroid, 4 ocular adnexa, and 2 skin).
Most t(3;14)(p14;q32)-positive MALT lymphomas also harbored additional
genetic abnormalities, such as trisomy 3. All 4 of the MALT-associated
translocations were mutually exclusive. Real-time RT-PCR analysis showed
upregulated expression of FOXP1 in MALT cases with t(3;14)(p14;q32) or
trisomy 3. Streubel et al. (2005) concluded that FOXP1 is a
translocation partner of IGH in a site-dependent subset of MALT
lymphomas.

Carr et al. (2010) reported a boy with severe speech delay and delayed
motor development (see 613670) who carried a de novo heterozygous 1.0-Mb
interstitial deletion of chromosome 3p14.1 that involved only the FOXP1
gene. The phenotype was confounded by a Chiari I malformation, which was
surgically corrected at age 30 months. The patient had delayed gross
motor skills and walked at 16 months. After surgery for the Chiari
malformation, he had some improvement in motor skills. The most
significant feature was speech delay with limited verbal output and
difficulty in articulating entire words and multisyllabic speech,
although he did not have a deficit in oromotor coordination. At age 4
years, he developed staring spells with motor arrest associated with
epileptiform discharges. He had mild dysmorphic facial features,
including broad forehead, hypertelorism, downslanting palpebral
fissures, ptosis, short nose, broad nasal tip, and smooth philtrum. Carr
et al. (2010) concluded that FOXP1 may play a role in the development of
verbal and motor skills.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Hamdan et al. (2010) identified 2 different de novo heterozygous
mutations in the FOXP1 gene (605515.0001 and 605515.0002, respectively)
in 2 unrelated children of French Canadian origin with moderate mental
retardation, expressive language deficits, and autistic features
(613670). The first mutation (605515.0001) was a small deletion found
using array-based comparative genomic hybridization of a cohort of 80
patients with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and 30 with intellectual
disability. The second mutation (R525X; 605515.0002) was found by direct
sequencing of the FOXP1 gene in a cohort of 110 patients with
intellectual disability, 84 with ASD, and 51 with both. Hamdan et al.
(2010) chose to examine the FOXP1 gene specifically because of the role
of the FOXP2 gene (605317) in a speech and language disorder (SPCH1;
602081); patients with intellectual disability and ASD often show
language impairment. The results indicated that disruption of FOXP1 has
a global impact on brain development.

ANIMAL MODEL

Hu et al. (2006) found that mice lacking Foxp1 died at embryonic day
14.5 due to heart valve and outflow tract abnormalities. Reconstitution
of Rag2 (179616)-deficient mice with Foxp1 -/- or Foxp1 +/- fetal liver
cells resulted in decreased mature B cells, but normal thymocytes, in
the recipients. Foxp1 -/- pro-B cells had reduced IgM, Rag1 (179615),
and Rag2 expression, and V(D)J rearrangement was also impaired in Foxp1
-/- B cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and EMSA analyses showed that
Foxp1 bound to Foxp site-2 (Fkh2) in the Erag enhancer, which is
upstream of Rag2, in a B-lineage specific way. Hu et al. (2006)
concluded that FOXP1 influences B-cell development at an early stage,
and that FOXP1 deficiency results in a phenotype that resembles double
haploinsufficiency of E2A (TCF3; 147141) and EBF (164343).

Feng et al. (2010) generated mice with a conditional deletion of Foxp1
in double-positive thymocytes and found that peripheral Cd4 (see 186940)
and Cd8 (see 186910) cells also lacked Foxp1 and that single-positive
thymocytes acquired an activated phenotype in thymus. Peripheral cells
also exhibited an activated phenotype and increased apoptosis and
readily produced cytokines upon T-cell receptor engagement. Feng et al.
(2010) concluded that FOXP1 is an essential transcriptional regulator
for thymocyte development and the generation of quiescent naive T cells.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MENTAL RETARDATION WITH LANGUAGE IMPAIRMENT AND AUTISTIC FEATURES
FOXP1, 390-KB DEL

In a French Canadian girl who had mental retardation with language
impairment and autistic features (613670), Hamdan et al. (2010)
identified a de novo heterozygous 390-kb intragenic deletion in the
FOXP1 gene. The deletion encompassed exons 4 to 14 of the longest FOXP1
isoform, including the translation initiation site and leucine zipper
and zinc finger domains important for transcriptional activity.

.0002
MENTAL RETARDATION WITH LANGUAGE IMPAIRMENT AND AUTISTIC FEATURES
FOXP1, ARG525TER

In a French Canadian boy who had mental retardation with language
impairment and autistic features (613670), Hamdan et al. (2010)
identified a de novo heterozygous 1573C-T transition in the FOXP1 gene,
resulting in an arg525-to-ter (R525X) substitution. The mutation was
predicted to abolish the last 152 residues of the protein, including
part of the forkhead DNA-binding (FHD) domain and a conserved nuclear
localization signal. The mutation was not found in 570 controls. In
vitro functional expression studies in HEK293 cells showed that the
R525X mutant impaired the transcriptional repression ability of FOXP1,
consistent with a loss of function.

114830	TITLE *114830 CARBONYL REDUCTASE 1; CBR1
;;CARBONYL REDUCTASE; CBR
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Carbonyl reductase (EC 1.1.1.184) is 1 of several monomeric,
NADPH-dependent oxidoreductases having wide specificity for carbonyl
compounds that are generally referred to as aldo-keto reductases. Others
include aldehyde reductase (EC 1.1.1.2; 103830) and aldose reductase (EC
1.1.1.21; 103880).

CLONING

Wermuth et al. (1988) isolated and characterized a cDNA complementary to
carbonyl reductase mRNA from a human placenta cDNA library. The cDNA
contained an open reading frame encoding a protein comprised of 277
amino acids with a molecular weight of 30,375. Comparison of the
predicted protein sequence with the primary structures of other
aldo-keto reductases showed no significant homologies. A possible
homology, on the other hand, was found between carbonyl reductase and
'short' subunit alcohol/polyol dehydrogenases. The enzyme is widely
distributed in human tissues and also occurs in other mammalian and
nonmammalian species.

In a carbonyl reductase cDNA cloned from a breast cancer cell line,
Forrest et al. (1990) demonstrated 1,219 basepairs. Southern analysis of
genomic DNA digested with several restriction enzymes and analyzed by
hybridization with a labeled cDNA probe indicated that carbonyl
reductase is probably coded by a single gene and does not belong to a
family of structurally similar enzymes. Carbonyl reductase mRNA was
induced 3- or 4-fold in 24 hours with BHA, beta-naphthoflavone, or Sudan
1.

MAPPING

By Southern blot analysis of 17 mouse/human somatic cell hybrids,
Forrest et al. (1990) showed that the CBR gene is located on chromosome
21.

Avramopoulos et al. (1992) confirmed assignment to chromosome 21 by
genetic linkage mapping using a DNA polymorphism from the 3-prime
untranslated region of the CBR gene. They demonstrated, furthermore,
that the gene lies between the interferon-alpha receptor gene (107450)
and D21S55, being about 3.4 and 7.2 cM, respectively, from the 2
flanking loci. The findings placed CBR in the telomeric band 21q22.3.

By high-resolution fluorescence in situ hybridization, Lemieux et al.
(1993) mapped the CBR gene to 21q22.12, very close to the SOD1 locus at
position 21q22.11. CBR displayed gene dosage effects in trisomy 21 human
lymphoblasts at both the DNA and the mRNA levels. With increasing
chromosome 21 ploidy, lymphoblasts also showed increased aldo-keto
reductase activity and increased quinone reductase activity. Both of
these activities have been shown to be associated with carbonyl
reductase. The location of CBR near SOD1 and the increased enzyme
activity and potential for free radical modulation in trisomy 21 cells
implicate CBR as a candidate for contributing to the pathology of Down
syndrome.

Wei et al. (1996) mapped the mouse Cbr1 gene to distal chromosome 16, as
had others. They identified a second carbonyl reductase gene in mouse
(Cbr2) and found that it mapped to distal chromosome 11.

GENE STRUCTURE

By sequence analysis of human chromosome region 21q22.2, Watanabe et al.
(1998) determined that the CBR1 gene contains 3 exons and spans 3.3 kb.
They identified a related gene, CBR3 (603608), 62 kb telomeric to CBR1.

GENE FUNCTION

Carbonyl reductase catalyzes the reduction of a great variety of
carbonyl compounds, e.g., quinones derived from polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons, 9-ketoprostaglandins, and the antitumor anthracycline
antibiotics daunorubicin and doxorubicin (Wermuth et al., 1988).

603110	TITLE *603110 MOTHERS AGAINST DECAPENTAPLEGIC, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, 5; SMAD5
;;MADH5;;
SMA- AND MAD-RELATED PROTEIN 5
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Drosophila Mad transduces signals from TGF-beta (e.g., 190180) family
members. By searching an expressed sequence tag (EST) database with the
protein sequences of Mad and Mad homologs, Riggins et al. (1996)
isolated partial human cDNAs encoding MADH5, which they called JV5-1.
The deduced MADH5 protein has 465 amino acids, with 57 of the C-terminal
59 residues identical to those of Mad.

Gemma et al. (1998) determined the full-length cDNA sequence of human
MADH5, which they called SMAD5. Using PCR-SSCP analysis to investigate
the frequency of SMAD5 somatic mutations in human cancers, Gemma et al.
(1998) did not detect either homozygous deletions or point mutations in
40 primary gastric tumors or 51 cell lines derived from diverse types of
cancer, including 20 cell lines resistant to the growth inhibitory
effects of TGF-beta. The SMAD5 protein has strong homology with SMAD1
(601595), SMAD2 (601366), SMAD3 (603109), and SMAD4 (600993) in the N-
and C-terminal domains, which are separated by a proline-rich sequence;
SMAD5 shows the greatest homology to SMAD1.

GENE FUNCTION

Bruno et al. (1998) showed that SMAD5 plays a critical role in the
signaling pathway by which TGF-beta inhibits the proliferation of human
hematopoietic progenitor cells.

Davis et al. (2008) demonstrated that induction of a contractile
phenotype in human vascular smooth muscle cells by TGF-beta and bone
morphogenetic proteins (BMPs; see 112264) is mediated by miR21 (611020).
miR21 downregulates PDCD4 (608610), which in turn acts as a negative
regulator of smooth muscle contractile genes. TGF-beta and BMP signaling
promoted a rapid increase in expression of mature miR21 through a
posttranscriptional step, promoting the processing of primary
transcripts of miR21 (pri-miR21) into precursor miR21 (pre-miR21) by the
Drosha complex (see 608828). TGF-beta and BMP-specific SMAD signal
transducers SMAD1, SMAD2, SMAD3, and SMAD5 (603110) are recruited to
pri-miR21 in a complex with the RNA helicase p68 (DDX5; 180630), a
component of the Drosha microprocessor complex. The shared cofactor
SMAD4 (600993) is not required for this process. Thus, Davis et al.
(2008) concluded that regulation of microRNA biogenesis by
ligand-specific SMAD proteins is critical for control of the vascular
smooth muscle cell phenotype and potentially for SMAD4-independent
responses mediated by the TGF-beta and BMP signaling pathways.

GENE STRUCTURE

By comparison of the SMAD5 cDNA sequence with the SMAD5 genomic
sequence, obtained from YAC clones, Gemma et al. (1998) showed that the
SMAD5 gene has 8 exons, with the coding sequence contained in exons 3 to
8. By 5-prime RACE, the authors identified a SMAD5 cDNA derived from an
alternatively spliced transcript that lacks the 75-bp exon 2.

MAPPING

Riggins et al. (1996) mapped the MADH5 gene to 5q31 by somatic cell
hybrid analysis and screening of YAC clones.

603219	TITLE *603219 POTASSIUM CHANNEL, SUBFAMILY K, MEMBER 2; KCNK2
;;TWIK-RELATED K+ CHANNEL; TREK;;
TREK1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TREK1 is a 2-pore-domain background potassium channel expressed
throughout the central nervous system. It is opened by polyunsaturated
fatty acids, lysophospholipids, and volatile anesthetics, and it is
inhibited by neurotransmitters that increase intracellular cAMP or
activate the Gq (600998) signaling pathway (Heurteaux et al., 2004).

CLONING

Potassium channels are ubiquitous multisubunit membrane proteins that
regulate membrane potential in numerous cell types. One family of
mammalian K+ channels is characterized by the presence of 4
transmembrane domains and 2 P (pore) domains per subunit; this family
includes TWIK (KCNK1; 601745) and TASK (KCNK3; 603220). Fink et al.
(1996) used degenerate PCR with primers based on the sequence of TWIK to
clone a novel member of this family, Trek, from a mouse brain cDNA
library. The Trek cDNA encodes a 370-amino acid polypeptide. Northern
blot analysis of mouse tissues demonstrated Trek expression at highest
levels in brain and lung and at lower levels in several other tissues.
In situ hybridization of mouse brain revealed that its expression is
widespread.

By searching EST databases for sequences similar to mouse Trek1,
followed by PCR, 3-prime RACE, and 5-prime RACE of fetal brain and
adrenal gland cDNA libraries, Meadows et al. (2000) cloned human TREK1.
The deduced 411-amino acid protein contains 4 transmembrane helices and
2 pore helices with the associated GFG tripeptide signature sequence.
The C terminus contains 7 consensus phosphorylation sites. Meadows et
al. (2000) recloned the 3-prime end of mouse Trek1 and obtained a
sequence encoding a 411-amino acid protein 96% identical to human TREK1.
Northern blot analysis of several human tissues detected a 3.8-kb
transcript only in brain. RT-PCR detected variable expression of TREK1
in all central nervous tissue examined. Expression was highest in
caudate nucleus, putamen, amygdala, thalamus, and spinal cord, and it
was higher in fetal brain than in whole adult brain. Expression in
peripheral tissues was much lower, with highest levels in stomach and
small intestine.

GENE FUNCTION

Fink et al. (1996) found that K+ currents generated by expressed mouse
Trek were outwardly rectifying, sensitive to extracellular K+ and Na+,
and insensitive to pharmacologic agents that block TWIK.

Patel et al. (1998) found that mouse Trek1 expressed in COS cells or in
Xenopus oocytes was responsive to cAMP, serotonin, arachidonic acid,
chloroform, membrane stretch, change in cell shape, and osmolarity. The
C-terminal region of Trek1 was necessary but not sufficient to provide
mechanical and chemical sensitivities. Trek1 truncation mutants lacking
2 C-terminal protein kinase A (see 176911) consensus phosphorylation
sites were insensitive to cAMP and serotonin, suggesting that
phosphorylation may be involved in downmodulation of Trek1 by cAMP.

Meadows et al. (2000) found that expression of TREK1 in Xenopus oocytes
produced a hyperpolarizing shift in the resting membrane potential
accompanied by induction of a large, outwardly rectifying,
noninactivating potassium current. TREK1-mediated currents were weakly
reduced by classic potassium channel blockers or open channel pore
blockers. Channel activity was reversibly potentiated by arachidonic
acid.

MAPPING

Lesage and Lazdunski (1998) used a radiation hybrid mapping panel to map
the human KCNK2 gene to chromosome 1q41 between markers WI5105 and
WI4396.

ANIMAL MODEL

Heurteaux et al. (2004) found that Trek1-null mice were born at expected
mendelian ratios, were healthy and fertile, and showed no morphologic
defects. Brain morphology, behavior, posture, locomotor activity, and
reflexes appeared normal in Trek1-null mice. However, Trek1-null animals
were more sensitive to ischemia and epilepsy than wildtype mice.
Neuroprotection by polyunsaturated fatty acids, which was strong in
wildtype animals, disappeared in Trek1-null mice. Trek1-null mice were
also resistant to anesthesia by volatile anesthetics. Heurteaux et al.
(2004) concluded that TREK1 plays a major role in the neuroprotection
against epilepsy and ischemia afforded by polyunsaturated fatty acids
and lysophospholipids, and in anesthesia induced by volatile
anesthetics.

In rodents, Blondeau et al. (2007) demonstrated that polyunsaturated
fatty acids, particularly alpha-linolenic acid, increased cerebral blood
flow and vasodilation of the basilar artery but not the carotid artery.
Vasodilation was independent of nitric oxide and prostanoids. Trek1 mRNA
was detected in myocytes and endothelial cells of the basilar artery but
not in carotid or femoral arteries. Polyunsaturated-induced vasodilation
of the basilar artery was abolished in Trek1-null mice. Blondeau et al.
(2007) suggested that the increased capacity of certain cerebral
arteries to dilate after treatment with polyunsaturated fatty acids via
the TREK1 channel increases collateral flow and thus may provide
residual cerebral circulation during ischemic stroke.

606436	TITLE *606436 SYNAPTOTAGMIN 12; SYT12
;;SYNAPTOTAGMIN-RELATED GENE 1, RAT, HOMOLOG OF; SRG1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SYT12 is a member of a family of proteins involved in the regulation of
transmitter release in the nervous system (Fernandez-Chacon et al.,
2001). The membrane-associated synaptic SYT12 protein in rat is under
thyroid hormone control during brain development (Thompson, 1996).

CLONING

Thompson (1996) used subtractive hybridization coupled with PCR
amplification to screen for thyroid hormone-responsive genes expressed
in rat cerebellum from postnatal days 10 through 15. She reported the
isolation and characterization of one such gene, Srg1, encoding a novel
protein related to synaptotagmin (see 185605). The Srg1 C-terminal
region, like those of other members of the synaptotagmin family,
consists of 2 C2 domains, which are related to the regulatory domain of
protein kinase C (see 176960). Also characteristic of synaptotagmins,
the Srg1 open reading frame lacks a signal sequence but has a
hydrophobic region near the N terminus, a putative transmembrane domain.
Srg1 shares between 26 and 37% amino acid sequence identity with other
members of the synaptotagmin family within the C-terminal region.
Thompson (1996) examined adult and neonatal rat tissues by Northern blot
analysis and detected Srg1 expression exclusively within the nervous
system. In situ hybridization demonstrated Srg1 expression in the
internal granule cell layer of the cerebellum. High levels of expression
were also found in cortex, caudate putamen, hippocampus, thalamus,
piriform cortex, and amygdala.

GENE FUNCTION

Thompson (1996) demonstrated that Syt12 is rapidly inducible by thyroid
hormone and that the timing of its expression is consistent with
regulation by thyroid hormone during development. Thompson (1996)
concluded that SYT12 is likely part of a cascade of gene activation
induced by thyroid hormone that is critical for central nervous system
organization and development. Regulation by thyroid hormone is not a
feature common to all members of the synaptotagmin family; Thompson
(1996) suggested that SYT12 may have unique functions among the
synaptotagmins.

Itoh et al. (2001) showed that Srg1 was markedly reduced in the
cerebellum of mice heterozygous for a targeted mutation in the Thra1
gene (190120).

NOMENCLATURE

Craxton (2001) referred to the human SYT11 (608741) and SYT12 genes as
SYT12 and SYT11, respectively.

The rat and mouse Syt12 genes were previously designated
synaptotagmin-related gene-1 and symbolized Srg1.

612915	TITLE *612915 MEDIATOR COMPLEX SUBUNIT 20; MED20
;;TRF-PROXIMAL, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF; TRFP
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MED20 is a subunit of the Mediator complex, a multiprotein coactivator
of RNA transcription that interacts with DNA-bound transcriptional
activators, RNA polymerase II (see 180660), and general initiation
factors (Sato et al., 2003).

CLONING

By sequencing peptides from a protein coimmunoprecipitated with SRB7
(MED21; 603800) from HeLa cell nuclear extracts, followed by database
analysis, Xiao et al. (1999) identified MED20, which they called TRFP.
The deduced 209-amino acid protein shares 44% amino identity with
Drosophila Trfp. TRFP had an apparent molecular mass of 28 kD by
SDS-PAGE.

GENE FUNCTION

Xiao et al. (1999) identified TRFP as a component of an RNA polymerase
II-SRB complex. The TRFP-containing complex could substitute for core
RNA polymerase II in driving basal transcription from a minimal
promoter.

By coexpression of epitope-tagged Mediator subunits, Sato et al. (2003)
found that TRFP appeared to bridge an interaction between the Mediator
subunits MED29 (612914) and p28b (MED18; 612384).

MAPPING

Hartz (2009) mapped the MED20 gene to chromosome 6p21.1 based on an
alignment of the MED20 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF097725) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.1).

610303	TITLE *610303 V-MAF AVIAN MUSCULOAPONEUROTIC FIBROSARCOMA ONCOGENE HOMOLOG A; MAFA
;;RIPE3B1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MAFA is a transcription factor that binds RIPE3b, a conserved enhancer
element that regulates pancreatic beta cell-specific expression of the
insulin gene (INS; 176730) (Olbrot et al., 2002).

CLONING

By searching a genomic database for sequences similar to hamster Mafa,
followed by PCR of genomic DNA, Olbrot et al. (2002) cloned human MAFA.
The deduced 352-amino acid protein contains an N-terminal activation
domain rich in serine, proline, and threonine, followed by 2
glycine-rich regions separated by a histidine-rich region, and a
C-terminal DNA-binding and dimerization domain containing a basic
leucine zipper. Northern blot analysis detected Mafa in mouse and
hamster insulinoma cells, in mouse thymus, and in mouse embryos at
embryonic day 14, and there was evidence of alternative splicing. No
expression was detected in other mouse tissues examined or in a
glucagon-producing cell line.

GENE FUNCTION

Using EMSA, Olbrot et al. (2002) found that full-length and N-terminally
truncated MAFA bound a RIPE3b probe, and it appeared to bind as a
homodimer. Following transfection in HeLa cells, only the full-length
protein activated insulin gene expression from the RIPE3b element,
although the N-terminally truncated form localized to the nucleus.

Expression of MAFA, as well as PDX1 (600733) and BETA2 (NEUROD1;
601724), 2 other transcription factors that bind enhancer elements in
the insulin gene, is enriched in beta cells. Following their
transfection into non-beta cell lines, Zhao et al. (2005) found that
rodent Pdx1 and Beta2 showed little or no activation of a reporter
construct driven by the insulin promoter in the absence of Mafa. Mafa
together with Pdx1 or Beta2 produced synergistic activation, and insulin
promoter activity was even higher when all 3 proteins were present.
Stimulation was attenuated upon compromising either Mafa transactivation
or DNA-binding activity. Coimmunoprecipitation and in vitro pull-down
assays showed that Mafa directly bound endogenous rodent Pdx1 and Beta2.
Dominant-negative and small interfering RNAs of Mafa profoundly reduced
insulin promoter activity in rodent beta cell lines. Mafa was induced in
parallel with insulin mRNA in glucose-stimulated rat islets, and insulin
mRNA levels were elevated in rat islets by adenovirus-mediated Mafa
expression. Zhao et al. (2005) concluded that MAFA plays a key role in
coordinating and controlling the level of insulin gene expression in
islet beta cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Olbrot et al. (2002) determined that the coding region of the MAFA gene
is intronless.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Olbrot et al. (2002) mapped the MAFA gene
to chromosome 8q24.

ANIMAL MODEL

Zhang et al. (2005) found that Mafa-null mice were born at the expected
frequency and survived until adulthood. Mafa-null mice displayed
intolerance to glucose and developed diabetes mellitus. Glucose-,
arginine-, or KCl-stimulated insulin secretion from pancreatic beta
cells was severely impaired, although insulin content per se was not
significantly affected. Mafa-null mice also showed age-dependent
pancreatic islet abnormalities. Molecular analysis revealed that Ins1,
Ins2, Pdx1, Beta2, and Glut2 (SLC2A2; 138160) transcripts were
diminished in Mafa-deficient mice.

Zhou et al. (2008) used a strategy of reexpressing key developmental
regulators in vivo to identify a specific combination of 3 transcription
factors, Neurog3 (604882), Pdx1 (600733), and Mafa, that reprogrammed
differentiated pancreatic exocrine cells in adult mice into cells that
closely resembled beta cells. Induced beta cells were indistinguishable
from endogenous islet beta cells in size, shape, and ultrastructure.
They expressed genes essential for beta cell function and could
ameliorate hyperglycemia by remodeling local vasculature and secreting
insulin. Zhou et al. (2008) concluded that their study provided an
example of cellular reprogramming using defined factors in an adult
organ and suggested a general paradigm for directing cell reprogramming
without reversion to a pluripotent stem cell state.

300767	TITLE *300767 REPLICATION PROTEIN A4; RPA4
;;RPA2, HOMOLOG OF;;
REPLICATION PROTEIN A COMPLEX, 34-KD SUBUNIT, HOMOLOG OF
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Replication protein A (RPA) is single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)-binding
complex essential for cell viability and chromosome stability. The
canonical RPA complex contains RPA1 (179835), RPA2 (179836), and RPA3
(179837). However, RPA4 can substitute for RPA2 to form an alternative
RPA complex (Mason et al., 2009).

CLONING

By yeast 2-hybrid screening of a HeLa cell library using RPA1 as bait
followed by RACE, Keshav et al. (1995) cloned RPA4. The deduced
261-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 28.9 kD. RPA4
shares 47% amino acid identity with RPA2 (179836), and both proteins
have glycine- and serine-rich N-terminal sequences. Western blot
analysis detected RPA4 as a 30-kD protein with strong expression in
human placenta and low expression in colon. RPA4 expression was also
detected in neuroblastoma, colon carcinoma, and Ewing sarcoma cell
lines.

GENE FUNCTION

Keshav et al. (1995) used immunoprecipitation, cosedimentation, and
other studies to demonstrate that RPA4 forms a trimeric complex with
RPA1 and RPA3 and that this complex binds ssDNA.

Mason et al. (2009) found that the alternative RPA complex (aRPA)
containing RPA4 instead of RPA2 bound ssDNA with an affinity comparable
to canonical RPA. However, unlike RPA, aRPA did not support replication
of simian virus 40 (SV40) in the presence of the viral protein large T
antigen (Tag). In addition, aRPA inhibited SV40 replication by RPA in a
dominant-negative manner. Domain exchange experiments between RPA2 and
RPA4 and mutation analysis revealed that a basic L34 loop within the
DNA-binding domain of RPA4 and the C-terminal winged-helix domain of
RPA4 were responsible for inhibition of SV40 DNA replication by RPA.
Mason et al. (2009) concluded that RPA4 plays a regulatory role in DNA
replication.

605342	TITLE *605342 PAIRED IMMUNOGLOBULIN-LIKE TYPE 2 RECEPTOR, BETA; PILRB
DESCRIPTION For background information, see PILRA (605341).

CLONING

By 5-prime RACE analysis of PILRA, Mousseau et al. (2000) identified a
cDNA encoding PILRB. PILRB encodes a protein with similar extracellular
features as PILRA but has a short cytoplasmic tail and a charged lysine
residue within its transmembrane domain, suggesting that it may be an
activating rather than an inhibitory receptor. RT-PCR analysis indicated
that PILRA and PILRB are expressed, or paired, at the mRNA level in
various tissues.

Shiratori et al. (2004) cloned and characterized mouse Pilrb.

GENE FUNCTION

Shiratori et al. (2004) identified a novel CD99 (313470)-like ligand for
mouse Pilrb that they termed Pilrl. Cells expressing Pilrl specifically
activated natural killer cells and dendritic cells expressing Pilrb.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Mousseau et al. (2000) determined that the
PILRB gene contains only 4 exons spanning approximately 9.8 kb, whereas
PILRA has 7 exons.

MAPPING

By long-range PCR on genomic DNA and comparison to a chromosome 7
segment (GenBank GENBANK RG161A02), Mousseau et al. (2000) mapped the
PILRB gene to chromosome 7, 5.6 kb upstream from PILRA.
