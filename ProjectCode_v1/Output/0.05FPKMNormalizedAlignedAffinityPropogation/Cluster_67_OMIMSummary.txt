DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The KCNQ2 gene encodes a voltage-gated potassium channel that is
expressed in the brain (Biervert et al., 1998).

CLONING

In the course of a search for the mutational basis of benign familial
neonatal seizures (BFNS1; 121200) mapping to chromosome 20, Singh et al.
(1998) identified a novel voltage-gated potassium channel gene that
showed significant homology to KVLQT1 (also known as KCNQ1 and KCNA9),
the chromosome 11 potassium channel gene responsible for long QT
syndrome-1 (192500) and a form of Jervell and Lange-Nielsen
cardioauditory syndrome (220400). A single cDNA isolated with the D20S24
probe in this region showed significant homology with KVLQT1. Singh et
al. (1998) found that the KCNQ2 cDNA hybridized to transcripts of
approximately 1.5, 3.8, and 9.5 kb on Northern blots made from brain.

By positional cloning from the 20q13.3 region where 1 form of benign
familial neonatal seizures is known to map, Biervert et al. (1998)
independently isolated the KCNQ2 gene and found that it was expressed in
brain.

Yang et al. (1998) described the cloning, tissue distribution, and
functional expression of KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 (602232), both of which are
associated with benign neonatal epilepsy. The deduced 871-amino acid
KCNQ2 protein has features of a voltage-gated potassium channel.
Northern blot analysis of 8 human tissues detected an 8.5-kb KCNQ2
transcript in brain only. Within brain, highest expression of KCNQ2 was
detected in cerebellar cortex, amygdala, caudate nucleus, and
hippocampus.

GENE STRUCTURE

Biervert and Steinlein (1999) determined that the KCNQ2 gene has at
least 18 exons, occupying more than 50 kb of genomic DNA. Splice
variants were identified. For example, in fetal brain, exon 8 was absent
in all transcripts, while this exon was present in clones derived from
adult brain RNA.

GENE FUNCTION

Biervert et al. (1998) found that expression of human KCNQ2 in Xenopus
laevis oocytes led to potassium-selective currents that activated slowly
with depolarization.

The M channel is a slowly activating and deactivating potassium
conductance that plays a critical role in determining the subthreshold
electroexcitability of neurons as well as the responsiveness to synaptic
inputs. The M current was first described in peripheral sympathetic
neurons, and differential expression of this conductance produces
subtypes of sympathetic neurons with distinct firing patterns. The M
channel is also expressed in many neurons in the central nervous system.
Wang et al. (1998) showed that the KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 channel subunits can
coassemble to form a channel with essentially identical biophysical
properties and pharmacologic sensitivities to the native M channel and
that the pattern of KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 gene expression is consistent with
these genes encoding the native M channel.

Yang et al. (1998) demonstrated that KCNQ2 and KCNQ3, both of which are
associated with benign neonatal epilepsy, interact functionally with
each other and with KCNE1 (176261), which is mutant in a form of Jervell
and Lange-Nielsen syndrome and in 1 form of long QT syndrome.

Cooper et al. (2000) provided information regarding the in vivo
distribution and biochemical characteristics of human brain KCNQ2 and
KCNQ3, the 2 channel subunits that form M channels when expressed in
vitro, and, when mutated, cause the dominantly inherited epileptic
syndrome, benign familial neonatal seizures. They found that the KCNQ2
and KCNQ3 proteins are colocalized in a somatodendritic pattern on
pyramidal and polymorphic neurons in the human cortex and hippocampus.
Immunoreactivity for KCNQ2, but not KCNQ3, is also prominent in some
terminal fields, suggesting a presynaptic role for a distinct subgroup
of M channels in the regulation of action potential propagation and
neurotransmitter release. KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 could be coimmunoprecipitated
from brain lysates. Further, both proteins were coassociated with
tubulin (see 602529) and protein kinase A (see 176911) within a triton
X-100-insoluble protein complex. Cooper et al. (2000) suggested that
these studies provided a view of a signaling complex that may be
important for cognitive function as well as epilepsy, and that analysis
of this complex may shed light on the transduction pathway linking
muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (see 118510) activation to M-channel
inhibition.

By recording channel currents produced in cRNA-injected Xenopus oocytes,
Zhang et al. (2003) found that phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate
(PIP2) activated all members of the KCNQ channel family analyzed,
including human KCNQ2 and heterodimers of human KCNQ2 and rat Kcnq3.
Similar results were obtained with mammalian cells expressing KCNQ2 and
Kcnq3. Mutation of his328-to-cys in KCNQ2 and his330-to-cys in Kcnq3
reduced or eliminated PIP2-mediated channel activation. Wortmannin, a
pharmacologic inhibitor of PIP2 regeneration, slowed the recovery from
PIP2 hydrolysis and decreased the sensitivity of the KCNQ2/Kcnq3 channel
to PIP2. Zhang et al. (2003) concluded that PIP2 acts as a
membrane-diffusible second messenger to regulate the activity of KCNQ
currents.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Benign Familial Neonatal Seizures 1

In affected members of a family with benign familial neonatal seizures-1
(BFNS1; 121200), Singh et al. (1998) identified a small deletion on
chromosome 20q encompassing the KCNQ2 gene. The finding was confirmed by
fluorescence in situ hybridization in an affected individual who
presented with seizures beginning at 3 days and had 118 generalized
seizures until the age of 23 days. A single seizure was observed at 3.5
months in conjunction with an acute infection of the middle ear with
fever, but no seizures were observed thereafter. Singh et al. (1998)
also identified different heterozygous mutations in the KCNQ2 gene (see,
e.g., 602235.0001 and 602235.0002) in additional families with BFNS1.

In a large pedigree with BFNS1, Biervert et al. (1998) found a 5-bp
insertion (602235.0003) that was predicted to delete more than 300 amino
acids from the C terminus of KCNQ2. Expression of the mutant channel did
not yield measurable currents. Thus, impairment of potassium-dependent
repolarization was indicated as the cause of this age-specific epileptic
syndrome.

Dedek et al. (2001) reported a Caucasian family in which BFNS was
followed later in life by myokymia, involuntary contractions of skeletal
muscles (see 121200). All affected members of the family carried an
arg207-to-trp mutation (R207W; 602235.0006) that neutralized a charged
amino acid in the S4 voltage-sensor segment of KCNQ2. This substitution
led to a shift of voltage-dependent activation of KCNQ2 and a dramatic
slowing of activation upon depolarization. Myokymia was thought to
result from hyperexcitability of the lower motoneuron; indeed both KCNQ2
and KCNQ3 mRNAs were detected in the anterior horn of the spinal cord
where the cells of the lower motoneurons arise. Dedek et al. (2001)
proposed that a difference in firing patterns between motoneurons and
central neurons, combined with the drastically slowed voltage activation
of the R207W mutant, explained by this particular KCNQ2 mutant caused
myokymia in addition to BFNC. Wuttke et al. (2007) identified a mutation
in the KCNQ2 gene (R207Q; 602235.0011) in a patient with isolated
myokymia.

Heron et al. (2007) identified 3 deletions and 1 duplication of more
than 1 exon of the KCNQ2 gene in 4 (44%) of 9 unrelated families with
benign familial neonatal seizures who had previously tested negative for
coding or splice site mutations. The changes were predicted to result in
haploinsufficiency. The authors suggested that multiplex
ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) should be a second-tier
testing strategy in candidate cases.

- Early Infantile Epileptic Encephalopathy 7

In a mother and son with severe epilepsy, Dedek et al. (2003) identified
a heterozygous mutation in the KCNQ2 gene (602235.0008). Both patients
had an atypical course characterized by drug-resistant seizures
necessitating ACTH treatment. In addition, the son developed early
infantile epileptic encephalopathy with delayed psychomotor development
(EIEE7; 613720). Functional expression studies showed that the S247W
mutation reduced channel currents by more than 50% in homomeric KCNQ2
channels. Dedek et al. (2003) emphasized that some KCNQ2 mutations may
be associated with a more severe phenotype than is typical for BFNC.

Weckhuysen et al. (2012) identified 7 different heterozygous mutations
in the KCNQ2 gene (see, e.g., 602235.0012-602235.0014) in 8 (10%) of 80
patients with neonatal or early infantile seizures and associated
psychomotor retardation. The mutations arose de novo in 7 cases; in 1
case, a severely affected patient inherited the mutation from her
father, who had a milder phenotype and was mosaic for the mutation. The
findings indicated that KCNQ2 mutations can occur in a substantial
proportion of patients with EIEE.

ANIMAL MODEL

The electroconvulsive threshold (ECT) test has been used extensively to
determine the protection conferred by antiepileptic drug candidates
against induced seizures in rodents. Yang et al. (2003) adopted the ECT
test to screen the progeny of ethylnitrosourea-treated male C57BL/6J
mice. In a small-scale screen, several mutant lines conferring a low
threshold to ECT minimal clonic seizures were mapped to the telomeric
region of mouse chromosome 2 in independent founder families. Genetic
and physical mapping data indicated that several lines shared a single
mutation, Szt1 (seizure threshold-1), consisting of a 300-kb deletion of
genomic DNA involving 3 known genes. Two of these genes, Kcnq2 and
Chrna4 (118504), are known to be mutated in human epilepsy families.
Szt1 homozygotes and heterozygotes displayed similar phenotypes to those
found in the respective Kcnq2 knockout mutant mice, suggesting that
Kcnq2 haploinsufficiency may lie at the root of the Szt1 seizure
sensitivity.

KCNQ2, TYR284CYS

In affected members of a family with benign familial neonatal seizures
(121200), Singh et al. (1998) demonstrated a TAC-to-TGC transition
converting codon 284 from tyrosine to cysteine. The family was too small
to permit demonstration of linkage to chromosome 20. The mutation
occurred in the pore region of the channel.

KCNQ2, ALA306THR

In their BFNS kindred 1705, Singh et al. (1998) demonstrated that
individuals affected with benign familial neonatal seizures (121200) had
an ala306-to-thr (A306T) amino acid substitution in the S6 transmembrane
segment. This alanine residue was conserved in all members of the
Shaker, Shab, Shaw, and Shal subfamilies of potassium channels.

KCNQ2, 5-BP INS

Biervert et al. (1998) identified an insertional mutation in the KCNQ2
gene in a large Australian Caucasian pedigree with benign familial
neonatal seizures (121200) previously reported by Berkovic et al.
(1994). Biervert et al. (1998) found a heterozygous 5-bp insertion at
the triplet encoding amino acid 534 in a segment highly conserved
between KCNQ2 and KCNQ1 (607542), which is mutated in type 1 long QT
syndrome (192500). The resulting frameshift was predicted to cause a
premature stop, which would truncate more than 300 amino acids. Of 13
affected family members, 10 had known neonatal seizures. Two patients
had afebrile seizures later, 1 of whom did not have neonatal seizures.
One mutation carrier was unaffected, indicating reduced penetrance.
Berkovic et al. (1994) noted the phenotypic heterogeneity in this
family.

KCNQ2, 1-BP DEL, 1846T

In a patient with benign familial neonatal seizures (121200), Biervert
and Steinlein (1999) identified a 1-bp deletion, 1846delT, in the KCNQ2
gene which caused a frameshift in exon 16, removing 228 amino acids from
the predicted wildtype sequence and replacing them with a stretch of 283
amino acids showing a completely different sequence. The mutation was
also present in the DNA sample obtained from the father but not in that
from the mother. The paternal grandmother reportedly had also suffered
from neonatal seizures but was not available for study.

KCNQ2, ARG214TRP

In a 4-generation Italian family segregating benign familial neonatal
seizures (121200), del Giudice et al. (2000) identified a 686C-T
mutation in exon 3 of the KCNQ2 gene, resulting in an arg214-to-trp
substitution. The mutation was found in the 8 affected members of the
pedigree and in 1 unaffected subject who was an obligate carrier. The
mutation occurred in the transmembrane domain S4, neutralizing one of
the conserved, positively charged residues of that segment. The
substitution abolished an AgeI restriction site and was not detected in
150 Italian controls.

SEIZURES, BENIGN FAMILIAL NEONATAL, 1, AND/OR MYOKYMIA
KCNQ2, ARG207TRP

In 5 affected members of a Caucasian family with BFNS and/or myokymia
(see 121200), Dedek et al. (2001) identified a heterozygous C-to-T
transition in exon 3 of the KCNQ2 gene, resulting in an arg207-to-trp
(R207W) substitution in the fourth transmembrane domain. Three mutation
carriers had BFNS with myokymia, 1 had isolated myokymia without
seizures, and 1 had neonatal seizures with no clinical signs of
myokymia, although electromyography demonstrated spontaneous discharges
of grouped motor unit potentials. In vitro functional expression studies
showed that the mutation resulted in a shift of voltage-dependent
activation of KCNQ2 and a dramatic slowing of activation upon
depolarization. The loss of potassium current was more severe compared
to other KCNQ2 mutations and showed a dominant-negative effect.

In a patient with isolated myokymia and no history of neonatal seizures,
Wuttke et al. (2007) identified an R207Q mutation (602235.0011) in the
same codon as the R207W mutation. In vitro functional expression studies
showed that mutant R207W and R207Q channels had large depolarizing
shifts and marked slowing of activation time compared to wildtype
channels. Coexpression with wildtype channels showed a dominant-negative
effect reducing the current amplitude by 70% after short depolarization.

KCNQ2, LYS526ASN

In 4 affected members of a family with BFNS1 (121200), Borgatti et al.
(2004) identified a heterozygous 1620G-A transition in the KCNQ2 gene,
resulting in a lys526-to-asn (K526N) substitution in the C-terminal
region of the protein. The mutation is located in a highly conserved
region within alpha-helix B that is necessary for calmodulin binding.
Functional expression studies showed that the K526N mutation decreased
the voltage-dependence of the channel. Although 2 patients had a
phenotype consistent with typical BFNS, the other 2 patients had a
complex phenotype that was atypical and severe, consistent with an
encephalopathy (EIEE7; 613720). One developed an extremely unfavorable
outcome, profound mental retardation, and spastic quadriparesis. The
other continued to have focal seizures until late infancy with a
moderate degree of mental retardation and a mild cerebellar syndrome.
Borgatti et al. (2004) noted that some patients with BFNS may experience
seizures later in life or a different set of epileptic subtypes
sometimes associated with severe neurologic and intellectual impairment.
Overall, the clinical, genetic, and functional data did not provide a
definitive explanation for the wide range of phenotypic variability
observed in the described family, therefore preventing
genotype-phenotype correlations. The authors postulated that the
phenotypic variability could be due to the interplay of pathogenic
mutations, modifier genes, and more subtle environmental factors.

For a similar EIEE7 phenotype, see Dedek et al. (2003) and 602235.0008.

KCNQ2, SER247TRP

In a mother and son with severe epilepsy, Dedek et al. (2003) identified
a heterozygous C-to-G transversion in exon 5 of the KCNQ2 gene,
resulting in a ser247-to-trp (S247W) substitution in the fifth
transmembrane residue of the protein. The mutation was not identified in
202 control chromosomes. Both patients had an atypical course
characterized by drug-resistant seizures necessitating ACTH treatment.
In addition, the son developed epileptic encephalopathy with delayed
psychomotor development (EIEE7; 613720). Functional expression studies
showed that the S247W mutation reduced channel currents by more than 50%
in homomeric KCNQ2 channels. Dedek et al. (2003) emphasized that some
KCNQ2 mutations may be associated with a more severe phenotype than is
typical for BFNS.

KCNQ2, 10-BP DEL/1-BP INS, NT761

In 9 affected members of a large Italian family with BFNS1 (121200),
Bassi et al. (2005) identified a heterozygous 10-bp deletion and 1-bp
insertion (761del10insA) in the KCNQ2 gene, resulting in a truncated
N-terminal peptide of 194 residues. The resultant mutant protein lacks
the S4 domain, which is critical for voltage sensing. In vitro
functional expression studies showed that the mutant KCNQ2 subunit was
unable to form functional homomeric potassium channels, suggesting
haploinsufficiency rather than a dominant-negative effect. One affected
family member developed severe epilepsy associated with mild mental
retardation and persistent neurologic problems in adult life (EIEE7;
613720); this phenotypic variability was considered by the authors to be
consistent with the fact that 10 to 15% of BFNS individuals experience
seizure manifestations later in life.

In affected members of a family with BFNS1 (121200), originally reported
by Rett and Teubel (1964), Zimprich et al. (2006) identified a
heterozygous 1-bp deletion (2127delT) in the last exon of the KCNQ2
gene, resulting in a replacement of the C terminus with 219 new amino
acids and a protein that is 56 residues longer than the wildtype
protein. Three of the 9 affected individuals later developed childhood
nocturnal generalized tonic-clonic seizures; 2 of the 3 also had simple
focal orofacial seizures.

KCNQ2, ARG207GLN

In a 25-year-old Egyptian man with isolated myokymia (see 121200),
Wuttke et al. (2007) identified a heterozygous G-to-A transition in the
KCNQ2 gene, resulting in an arg207-to-gln (R207Q) substitution in a
highly conserved residue in the voltage sensor region of the potassium
channel. He had no history of neonatal seizures and no family history of
epilepsy or peripheral nerve hyperexcitability. Clinically, he had
permanent muscle overactivity in the distal upper extremities and small
amplitude movements of the fingers, which were not disabling. However,
he also reported exercise-induced cramps of both hands since childhood
and 4 episodes of exercise-induced generalized muscle stiffness. EMG
showed spontaneous irregular discharges consistent with myokymia. Wuttke
et al. (2007) noted that a mutation in the same codon (R207W;
602235.0006) had been associated with neonatal epilepsy and/or myokymia.
In vitro functional expression studies showed that mutant R207W and
R207Q channels had large depolarizing shifts and marked slowing of
activation time compared to wildtype channels. Coexpression with
wildtype channels showed a dominant-negative effect reducing the current
amplitude by 70% after short depolarization.

KCNQ2, ARG213GLN

In a girl with EIEE7 (613720), Weckhuysen et al. (2012) identified a
heterozygous 638G-A transition in the KCNQ2 gene, resulting in an
arg213-to-gln (R213Q) substitution at a highly conserved residue in the
transmembrane domain. The mutation was not found in 276 control
individuals. The patient had onset of multiple daily seizures on the
second day of life, and the mother had noted jerking movements during
pregnancy. The patient had poor response to treatment, but the seizures
remitted at age 14 months. However, at age 2 years 10 months, she had
severe psychomotor retardation, could not roll over, was nonverbal, had
severe spastic quadriplegia, and some dysmorphic features. Her father,
who had benign neonatal seizures and myokymia, was mosaic for the
mutation, which was found in 30% of his lymphocytes.

In a 9-year-old boy with EIEE7 (613720), Weckhuysen et al. (2012)
identified a de novo heterozygous 1636A-G transition in the KCNQ2 gene,
resulting in a met546-to-val (M546V) substitution at a highly conserved
residue in one of the calmodulin binding domains in the C-terminal
region. The mutation was not found in 276 control individuals. On the
third day of life, the patient had onset of multiple daily tonic
seizures resistant to treatment and associated with a burst suppression
pattern on EEG that evolved into multifocal epileptic activity. Seizures
remitted at age 3 years and the EEG was normal at age 8. However, he had
psychomotor retardation, mild spasticity, widely spaced gait, and lack
of speech development. Brain imaging showed lesions in the basal ganglia
and a thin posterior corpus callosum.

In 2 unrelated patients with EIEE7 (613720), Weckhuysen et al. (2012)
identified a de novo heterozygous 869G-A transition in the KCNQ2 gene,
resulting in a gly290-to-asp (G290D) substitution at a highly conserved
residue in the transmembrane domain. The mutation was not found in 276
control individuals. Both patients had onset of multiple daily tonic
seizures on the second day of life, but the seizures remitted at around
age 3 years. EEG studies were abnormal at first, but normalized over
time. Both patients showed psychomotor retardation and were nonverbal.
One had axial hypotonia and widely spaced gait, whereas the other had
spastic quadriparesis.

609735	TITLE *609735 RING FINGER AND FYVE-LIKE DOMAIN CONTAINING 1; RFFL
;;RIFIFYLIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By EST database searching, Coumailleau et al. (2004) identified and
subsequently cloned rififylin (RING finger and FYVE-like
domain-containing) from mouse testis cDNA. The mouse Rffl cDNA encodes 2
proteins of 336 and 364 amino acids, generated by alternative splicing.
The N-terminal region contains a domain related to the FYVE double zinc
finger domain that mediates binding to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate
(PIK3; see 171834), and the C-terminal region contains a consensus
sequence for a C3HC4 RING finger domain. Northern blot analysis revealed
a ubiquitously expressed transcript of approximately 4 kb and a smaller
transcript of about 2 kb at a very high level in testis and at a
moderate level in liver. RT-PCR indicated that both proteins are
ubiquitously expressed, with the larger isoform almost exclusively
expressed in adult mouse liver and kidney cells and in HeLa cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Coumailleau et al. (2004) found that Rffl-GFP localized to globular
structures at the perinuclear region. Coexpression of Rffl-GFP with
various endosomal markers demonstrated that the Rffl-positive structures
belonged to the endocytic recycling compartment (ERC). Morphologic
analysis of HeLa cells overexpressing Rffl revealed an aggregation of
perinuclear transferrin receptor-positive tubules. Pulse-chase
experiments showed that overexpression of Rffl significantly slowed
recycling from the ERC to the plasma membrane. Deletion mutant
experiments demonstrated that the Rffl N-terminal FYVE domain is
necessary and sufficient for targeting Rffl to the ERC and for
inhibiting transferrin recycling. In contrast, the C-terminal zinc
finger domain is dispensable for the effect mediated by Rffl
overexpression on recycling endosomes. Using inhibitors of
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases, Coumailleau et al. (2004) found that
Rffl acts mainly on a PIK3-independent pathway.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the RFFL
gene to chromosome 17 (TMAP WI-15077). Coumailleau et al. (2004)
identified the mouse Rffl gene on chromosome 11.

614525	TITLE *614525 NFATC2-INTERACTING PROTEIN; NFATC2IP
;;NFAT-INTERACTING PROTEIN, 45-KD; NIP45
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

NFATC2IP interacts with NFATC2 (600490) and other NFAT transcription
factors and augments NFAT-driven IL4 (147780) expression by a mechanism
that relies on arginine methylation (Fathman et al., 2010).

CLONING

By yeast 2-hybrid screening of a mouse T-cell cDNA library using the Rel
(164910) homology domain (RHD) of mouse Nfatc2 as bait, Hodge et al.
(1996) cloned Nfatc2ip, which they called Nip45. The predicted 412-amino
acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 45 kD and contains a
highly basic N-terminal domain. Northern blot analysis of mouse tissues
detected a 3.1-kb transcript in spleen, thymus, and testis. An
additional 1.4-kb transcript was also detected in testis. Fluorescence
microscopy showed that Nip45 was evenly distributed throughout the
nucleus, and this localization was not altered by mitogen stimulation.

GENE FUNCTION

Using reporter gene analysis in a human liver cell line, Hodge et al.
(1996) showed that cotransfection of mouse Nip45 with Nfatc2 or other
NFAT family members increased NFAT transactivation activity compared
with transfection of NFAT proteins alone. Cotransfection of Nip45,
Nfatc2, and Maf (177075) resulted in increased Il4, but not Il5
(147850), production by mouse B-lymphoma cells.

MAPPING

Gross (2012) mapped the NFATC2IP gene to chromosome 16p11.2 based on an
alignment of the NFATC2IP sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC068007) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

ANIMAL MODEL

Fathman et al. (2010) found that Nip45 -/- mice were born at the
expected mendelian ratio and appeared healthy and viable. Disruption of
Nip45 reduced expression of Nfat-regulated T-helper cell genes,
including Il4, without affecting Nfat expression and activation.
Diminished Il4 expression by Th2 cells was attributed to reduced
recruitment of Prmt1 (602950) and concomitant methylation of arg3 on
histone-4 (see 602822) with the Il4 promoter. These subtle changes were
amplified in vivo with a compromised type-2 immune response to
Trichinella spiralis.

608736	TITLE *608736 SOLUTE CARRIER FAMILY 39 (ZINC TRANSPORTER), MEMBER 14; SLC39A14
;;ZIP14;;
KIAA0062
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Zinc is an essential cofactor for hundreds of enzymes. It is involved in
protein, nucleic acid, carbohydrate, and lipid metabolism, as well as in
the control of gene transcription, growth, development, and
differentiation. SLC39A14 belongs to a subfamily of proteins that show
structural characteristics of zinc transporters (Taylor and Nicholson,
2003).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated immature myeloid
cell line cDNA library, Nomura et al. (1994) cloned SLC39A14, which they
designated KIAA0062. The deduced 531-amino acid protein contains
possible transmembrane domains. Northern blot analysis detected SLC39A14
expression in all tissues and cell lines examined. Highest expression
was in liver, and lowest expression was in spleen, thymus, and
peripheral blood leukocytes.

By searching databases for sequences similar to a unique motif within
LIV-1 (SLC39A6; 608731), Taylor and Nicholson (2003) identified
SLC39A14, which they designated LZT-Hs4. SLC39A14 contains a long N
terminus, followed by 8 putative transmembrane domains and a short C
terminus. It also has a motif similar to the catalytic zinc-binding site
of matrix metalloproteases. Expression of SLC39A14 in Chinese hamster
ovary cells showed an apparent molecular mass of 53 kD and suggested
SLC39A14 has up to 3 N-linked carbohydrate side chains. Under
nonreducing conditions, SLC39A14 migrated as a trimer, consistent with
the formation of an ion channel. SLC39A14 was expressed on the plasma
membrane, colocalized with F-actin, and concentrated on lamellipodiae in
a manner similar to membrane-type matrix metalloproteases.

GENE FUNCTION

Liuzzi et al. (2005) found that Zip14 was the most upregulated zinc
transporter in response to turpentine-induced inflammation or
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in mouse liver. Il6 (147620) -/- mice exhibited
neither hypozincemia nor Zip14 induction with turpentine-induced
inflammation, and the hypozincemic response was milder in Il6 -/- mice
exposed to LPS than in wildtype mice. Northern blot analysis revealed
liver-specific upregulation of a single Zip14 transcript.
Immunohistochemical analysis showed increased expression of Zip14 on the
plasma membrane of hepatocytes in response to both LPS and turpentine.
Il6 also produced increased expression of Zip14 in primary hepatocyte
cultures and localization of the Zip14 protein to the plasma membrane.
Transfection of mouse Zip14 cDNA into human embryonic kidney cells
increased zinc uptake. Liuzzi et al. (2005) concluded that ZIP14 is a
zinc importer upregulated by IL6 that plays a major role in the
hypozincemia accompanying the acute-phase response to inflammation and
infection.

Liuzzi et al. (2006) analyzed the capability of mouse Zip14 to mediate
uptake of non-transferrin (190000)-bound iron following expression in
human and insect cells. Zip14 localized to the plasma membrane, and its
overexpression increased uptake of both radiolabeled zinc and iron. Iron
was taken up as Fe(2+), and uptake was inhibited by zinc. Suppression of
endogenous Zip14 in mouse hepatocytes by small interfering RNA (siRNA)
reduced uptake of both iron and zinc. Zip14 siRNA also decreased
metallothionein (see 156350) mRNA levels, suggesting that compensatory
mechanisms were not sufficient to restore intracellular zinc.

MAPPING

By PCR of a human/rodent hybrid panel, Nomura et al. (1994) mapped the
SLC39A14 gene to chromosome 8.

604900	TITLE *604900 DIACYLGLYCEROL O-ACYLTRANSFERASE 1; DGAT1
;;DGAT;;
ACYL-CoA:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE;;
ARGP1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT; EC 2.3.1.20) is a
microsomal enzyme that plays a central role in the metabolism of
cellular diacylglycerol lipids and catalyzes the terminal and only
committed step in triacylglycerol synthesis by using diacylglycerol
(DAG) and fatty acyl CoA as substrates. DGAT had been considered
necessary for adipose tissue formation and essential for survival
(summary by Cases et al., 1998).

CLONING

Using the sequence of human acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase-1
(ACAT1; see 203750) to screen EST databases, Oelkers et al. (1998)
identified 2 novel and distinct partial human cDNAs. ARGP1 and ARGP2 (so
named for 'ACAT-related gene products 1 and 2') were isolated from a
hepatocyte cDNA library. ARGP1 was expressed in numerous human adult
tissues and tissue culture cell lines, whereas expression of ARGP2 was
more restricted. The ARGP1 cDNA encodes a protein of 488 amino acids
with 9 predicted transmembrane domains, a potential N-linked
glycosylation site, and a putative tyrosine phosphorylation motif.
Comparison to ACAT1 revealed 22% amino acid identity over the entire
molecule. Northern blot analysis of ARGP1 indicated ubiquitous
expression with a great variability in level of expression. There was
high expression in the adrenal cortex, adrenal medulla, testes, and
small intestine, with moderate expression in thyroid, stomach, heart,
skeletal muscle, and liver. A 2.0-kb transcript was invariable in all
tissues examined, while a 2.4-kb transcript was observed in about half
the tissues.

Cheng et al. (2001) cloned DGAT1 from an adipose tissue cDNA library and
identified a splice variant, which they designated DGATsv, that contains
a 77-nucleotide insert of unspliced intron with an in-frame stop codon.
DGATsv is a truncated form of DGAT1 that terminates at arg387, deleting
101 residues from the C terminus, including the putative active site. By
gel filtration, coimmunoprecipitation, and SDS/PAGE of cross-linked
recombinant proteins, Cheng et al. (2001) determined that both DGAT1 and
DGATsv form dimers and tetramers. When coexpressed, the 2 variants
formed heterocomplexes.

GENE FUNCTION

By in vitro assay of HEK293E cells transfected with DGATsv, Cheng et al.
(2001) determined that DGATsv is enzymatically inactive but is able to
form dimers and tetramers. When coexpressed, DGATsv did not inhibit the
activity of full-length DGAT1 and did not act as a dominant-negative
protein. Cheng et al. (2001) concluded that the individual subunits
within the tetrameric complex might be able to perform enzymatic
reactions independently.

Using short hairpin RNA and a small molecule DGAT1 inhibitor, Herker et
al. (2010) showed that DGAT1, but not DGAT2 (606983), was required for
hepatitis C virus (HCV; see 609532) infection and virus assembly.
Immunofluorescence microscopy and coimmunoprecipitation experiments
demonstrated that the viral core protein was retained at the endoplasmic
reticulum in lipid droplets in cells treated with the DGAT1 inhibitor.
Herker et al. (2010) concluded that DGAT1 is a host factor for HCV
infection that binds core protein, localizes it to DGAT1-generated lipid
droplets, and recruits viral RNA replication complexes for viral
assembly. DGAT2-generated lipid droplets formed normally in cells
treated with the DGAT1 inhibitor, suggesting that DGAT1 inhibitors may
be useful as antiviral therapeutics.

MAPPING

Cases et al. (1998) mapped the human DGAT gene to chromosome 8qter by
FISH. They mapped the mouse homolog to a region of chromosome 15 that
exhibits homology of synteny with human chromosome 8.

ANIMAL MODEL

Smith et al. (2000) demonstrated that Dgat-deficient mice generated by
targeted disruption were viable and still synthesized triglycerides.
Moreover, these mice were lean and resistant to diet-induced obesity.
The obesity resistance involved increased energy expenditure and
increased activity. Dgat deficiency also altered triglyceride metabolism
in other tissues, including the mammary gland, where lactation was
defective in Dgat -/- females. Smith et al. (2000) concluded that
multiple mechanisms exist for triglyceride synthesis and suggested that
the selective inhibition of DGAT-mediated triglyceride synthesis may be
useful for treating obesity.

Buhman et al. (2002) analyzed the Dgat1-deficient mouse model and found
that Dgat1 was not essential for quantitative dietary triacylglycerol
absorption, even in mice fed a high-fat diet, or for the synthesis of
chylomicrons. However, Dgat1-null mice had reduced postabsorptive
chylomicronemia 1 hour after a high-fat challenge. When chronically fed
a high-fat diet, they accumulated neutral lipid droplets in the
cytoplasm of enterocytes, suggesting reduced triacylglycerol absorption.
Analysis of intestine from Dgat1-null mice revealed that the activity of
enzymes involved in triacylglycerol synthesis, Dgat2 (606983) and
diacylglycerol transacylase, may help to compensate for the absence of
Dgat1.

Using the positional candidate approach, Grisart et al. (2002) mapped a
quantitative trait locus with a major effect on milk composition in
dairy cattle to the centromeric end of bovine chromosome 14, where the
Dgat1 gene maps. They identified a nonconservative lys232-to-ala
substitution in the Dgat1 gene that had a major effect on milk yield and
characteristics, including fat content.

114210	TITLE *114210 S100 CALCIUM-BINDING PROTEIN A4; S100A4
;;CALCIUM PLACENTAL PROTEIN; CAPL;;
FIBROBLAST-SPECIFIC PROTEIN 1; FSP1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

S100 proteins, such as S100A4, are small, acidic calcium-binding
proteins that transduce Ca(2+)-signals via interaction with
intracellular target proteins (Mandinova et al., 1998).

CLONING

Engelkamp et al. (1992) cloned S100A4, which they called CAPL, from a
human heart cDNA library. The deduced 101-amino acid protein has the
domain structure of an S100 protein, with N- and C-terminal hydrophobic
regions and 2 central calcium loops. Northern blot analysis detected
ubiquitous expression of a 650-bp transcript, with highest expression in
thymus, lung, and heart.

Ambartsumian et al. (1995) described 2 alternative splice variants of
S100A4 that differ in their 5-prime untranslated regions.

Using immunofluorescence analysis and confocal laser scanning
microscopy, Mandinova et al. (1998) showed that S100A1 (176940), S100A2
(176993), S100A4, and S100A6 (114110) localized to distinct
intracellular compartments in cultured human vascular and intestinal
smooth muscle cells. S100A1 and S100A4 were associated predominantly
with the sarcoplasmic reticulum and with actin stress fibers.

GENE FUNCTION

Mandinova et al. (1998) showed that elevated cytosolic Ca(2+) led to
relocalization of S100A1, S100A4, and S100A6 from sarcoplasmic reticulum
to vesicle-like structures around the nucleus in human vascular smooth
muscle cells. The localization of stress fiber-associated S100A1 and
S100A4 remained unchanged.

Fernandez-Fernandez et al. (2005) found that S100B (176990) and S100A4
bound the C-terminal tetramerization domain of p53 (191170) when the
domain was exposed in lower oligomerization states, disrupting p53
tetramerization. S100B bound to the negative regulatory and nuclear
localization domains of p53, resulting in very tight binding. Because
trafficking of p53 depends on its oligomerization state,
Fernandez-Fernandez et al. (2005) proposed that S100B and S100A4 may
regulate subcellular localization of p53 but with different effects on
p53 function in cell cycle control due to their differences in binding
p53.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ambartsumian et al. (1995) showed that the S100A4 gene consists of 4
exons.

MAPPING

Jackson-Grusby et al. (1987) isolated a probe for the mouse placental
protein for which the human equivalent was symbolized CAPL by van
Heyningen et al. (1989). By Southern blot analysis of DNAs from somatic
cell hybrids, van Heyningen et al. (1989) and Dorin et al. (1990) showed
that the CAPL gene in man cosegregates with CAGA (123885), CAGB
(123886), and calcyclin (114110). In the hands of van Heyningen et al.
(1989), Southern blot analysis of DNA from BxD recombinant inbred strain
mice showed a TaqI polymorphism for CAPL probe 18A2 to distinguish the
parental strains. CAPL cosegregated in the BxD mice with a fifth member
of this gene family, the p11 protein (mouse symbol Cal11) which had been
mapped to chromosome 3 by Saris et al. (1987). In the mouse Capl is
within 8 kb of Cacy; thus, by homology, the CAPL gene in man is probably
in region 1q21-q25 where the CACY gene has been mapped.

Schafer et al. (1995) isolated a YAC clone from the 1q21 region on which
9 different genes coding for S100 calcium-binding proteins could be
localized. The clustered organization of S100 genes allowed introduction
of a new logical nomenclature based on their physical arrangement on the
chromosome, with S100A1 (176940) being closest to the telomere and
S100A9 being closest to the centromere. In this revised nomenclature,
CAPL became S100A4.

;;NEUTROPHIL GELATINASE-ASSOCIATED LIPOCALIN; NGAL;;
ONCOGENIC LIPOCALIN 24P3;;
UTEROCALIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Lipocalin-2 (LCN2), also known as NGAL, is a protein associated with
neutrophil gelatinase (Kjeldsen et al., 1993). The 25-kD LCN2 protein is
believed to bind small lipophilic substances such as bacteria-derived
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and formylpeptides and may function as a
modulator of inflammation. By screening a human genomic library with an
LCN2 cDNA, Cowland and Borregaard (1997) isolated the LCN2 genomic
sequence. The primary LCN2 transcript is 3,696 nucleotides long, and the
processed transcript is 809 nucleotides long. RNA dot blot analysis of
50 human tissues detected LCN2 expression in adult bone marrow, uterus,
prostate, salivary gland, stomach, appendix, colon, trachea, and lung,
and in fetal spleen and lung.

GENE FUNCTION

Using DNA microarrays to analyze IL3 (147740)-dependent murine FL5.12
pro-B cells, Devireddy et al. (2001) found that the gene undergoing
maximal transcriptional induction after cytokine withdrawal is 24p3,
which encodes a secreted lipocalin (lipocalin-2). Conditioned medium
from IL3-deprived cells contained 24p3 and induced apoptosis in naive
cells, even when IL3 was present. 24p3 also induced apoptosis in a wide
variety of leukocytes but not other cell types. Apoptotic sensitivity
correlated with the presence of a putative 24p3 cell surface receptor.
Devireddy et al. (2001) concluded that IL3 deprivation activates 24p3
transcription, leading to synthesis and secretion of 24p3, which induces
apoptosis through an autocrine pathway. In addition to murine FL5.12
pro-B cells, many other cell types were sensitive to 24p3-mediated
apoptosis: murine primary thymocytes, murine primary splenocytes, murine
primary bone marrow cells, human primary neutrophils, and human
peripheral blood lymphocytes. In contrast, human primary macrophages,
HeLa cells, and Jurkat cells were not susceptible to 24p3-mediated
apoptosis.

Goetz et al. (2002) reported that NGAL tightly binds bacterial
catecholate-type ferric siderophores through a cyclically permuted,
hybrid electrostatic/cation-pi interaction and is a potent
bacteriostatic agent in iron-limiting conditions. They proposed that
NGAL participates in the antibacterial iron depletion strategy of the
innate immune system.

Yang et al. (2002) showed that NGAL delivers iron to the cytoplasm,
where it activates or represses iron-responsive genes. Iron unloading
depended on the cycling of NGAL through acidic endosomes, but its pH
sensitivity and its subcellular targeting differed from transferrin
(190000). During the conversion of mesenchyme into epithelia, NGAL and
transferrin were endocytosed by different cells that characterize
different stages of development, and they triggered unique responses.
These studies identified an iron delivery pathway active in development
and cell physiology.

Flo et al. (2004) demonstrated that the binding of lipocalin-2 to
bacterial siderophores is pivotal in the innate immune response to
bacterial infection. Upon encountering invading bacteria the Toll-like
receptors on immune cells stimulate the transcription, translation, and
secretion of lipocalin-2. Secreted lipocalin-2 then limits bacterial
growth by sequestrating the iron-laden siderophore. Flo et al. (2004)
concluded that their findings represent a new component of the innate
immune system and the acute phase response to infection.

Using healthy human skin fragments obtained as surgical residua,
Sorensen et al. (2006) demonstrated that sterile wounding of human skin
induces epidermal expression of the antimicrobial polypeptides
beta-defensin-103 (DEFB103; 606611), LCN2, and secretory leukocyte
protease inhibitor (SLPI; 107285) through activation of EGFR (131550) by
heparin-binding EGF (HBEGF; 126150).

Yang et al. (2009) found that overexpression of LCN2 in clones of human
MFC-7 breast cancer (114480) cells induced expression of mesenchymal
markers on these cells, including vimentin (VIM; 193060) and fibronectin
(FN1; 135600), and downregulated the epithelial cell marker E-cadherin
(CDH1; 192090), consistent with an epithelial to mesenchymal transition.
Cell motility and invasiveness were also increased. The cancer cell
clones with increased LCN2 expression also showed decreased estrogen
receptor (ESR1; 133430) expression and increased SLUG (SNAI2; 602150)
expression. Inhibition of LCN2 in aggressive breast cancer cells
(MDA-MB-231) reduced migration and suppressed the mesenchymal phenotype.
Studies in mice showed that breast cancer cells with high LCN2
expression resulted in increased local invasion and lymph node
metastases compared to those with low LCN2 expression. In humans,
increased urinary LCN2 levels correlated with invasive breast cancer.

Estrogen receptor-alpha (ERA, or ESR1)-positive breast cancer cells are
less invasive than ERA-negative breast cancer cells. Fougere et al.
(2010) found that ERA-positive breast cancer cells had upregulated
expression of NFAT3 (NFATC4; 602699) and downregulated expression of
LCN2 compared with ERA-negative breast cancer cells. Overexpression and
knockdown studies suggested that NFAT3 cooperated with ERA in
downregulation of LCN2, although indirectly, and downregulated LCN2
expression correlated with reduced invasiveness and metastasis.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Cowland and Borregaard (1997) determined
that the LCN2 gene contains 7 exons.

MAPPING

LCN1 (151675) and LCN2 map to 9q34 by in situ hybridization (Chan et
al., 1994). By linkage analyses in an interspecific backcross progeny in
the mouse, Chan et al. (1994) mapped the Lcn2 gene to mouse chromosome
2.

ANIMAL MODEL

Berger et al. (2006) found that Lcn2 -/- mice had increased
susceptibility to bacterial infection. Neutrophils from Lcn2 -/- mice
were significantly less bacteriostatic than neutrophils from wildtype
mice. Bacteriostatic activity of wildtype mice was abolished by addition
of exogenous iron, suggesting that LCN2 limits iron for bacteria. Lcn2
-/- females, but not males, were significantly less fertile than
wildtype mice. Otherwise, Lcn2 -/- mice appeared healthy, including
normal kidney development, immune cell types, and susceptibility to
apoptosis. Deficiency of Lcn2 had no impact on severity of ischemic
kidney damage. Berger et al. (2006) concluded that LCN2 has an essential
role in the early stages of the immune response to bacterial infection,
with its loss leading to host mortality due to accelerated bacterial
growth.

Nairz et al. (2009) found that mice lacking 1 or both Hfe (613609)
alleles were protected from Salmonella typhimurium septicemia,
displaying reduced bacterial replication and prolonged host survival.
Increased resistance was associated with enhanced production of the
enterochelin-binding protein Lcn2, which reduced iron availability for
Salmonella. Macrophages lacking both Hfe and Lcn2 were unable to
efficiently control S. typhimurium or to withhold iron from the
bacterium. Salmonella lacking enterochelin overcame protection in Hfe
-/- mice, as did wildtype bacteria in Hfe -/- Lcn2 -/- double-knockout
mice. Nairz et al. (2009) concluded that loss of HFE confers host
resistance to systemic Salmonella infection by inducing the
iron-capturing peptide LCN2, thereby providing an evolutionary advantage
that may account for the high prevalence of genetic hemochromatosis
(235200).

Liu et al. (2011) found an abnormal increase in myeloid, B-cell, and
erythroid precursors in bone marrow of 24p3 -/- mice. The number of
leukocytes of all types, except for basophils, was also elevated in
peripheral blood of 24p3 -/- mice. Liu et al. (2011) found that the
abnormal hematologic profile in 24p3 -/- mice was due to their
resistance to an apoptotic pathway involving Bim (BCL2L11; 603827) and
intracellular iron content, in addition to 24p3, and was specific to
relatively mature committed progenitors and precursor cells.

Srinivasan et al. (2012) found that LPS induced a 150-fold increase in
Lcn2 in wildtype mice. Lcn2 -/- mice were markedly more sensitive to
endotoxemia compared with wildtype littermates, with increased organ
damage, as assessed by transaminasemia and lactate dehydrogenase, and
mortality. Severe endotoxemia was associated with elevated Casp3
(600636) cleavage and immune cell apoptosis. Lcn2 -/- cells were
hyperresponsive to LPS ex vivo, as determined by elevated cytokine
secretion. Lcn2 -/- mice exhibited delayed LPS-induced hypoferremia,
despite having normal hepatic hepcidin (HAMP; 606464) expression, and
decreased levels of the tissue redox state indicators cysteine and
glutathione in liver and plasma. Lcn2 -/- mice were significantly
protected from LPS-induced toxicity and mortality by the iron chelator
desferroxamine. Srinivasan et al. (2012) proposed that LCN2 acts as an
antioxidant in vivo by regulating iron hemostasis and thereby protects
against sepsis.

605517	TITLE *605517 BETA-1,3-N-ACETYLGLUCOSAMINYLTRANSFERASE 1; B3GNT1
;;i-BETA-1,3-N-ACETYLGLUCOSAMINYLTRANSFERASE; iGNT
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The B3GNT1 gene encodes a type II transmembrane protein involved in
glycosylation of target proteins (summary by Buysse et al., 2013).

CLONING

By means of an expression cloning strategy, Sasaki et al. (1997)
isolated a cDNA encoding i-beta-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase.
Sequence analysis predicted that the 415-amino acid type II
transmembrane protein has a short N-terminal cytoplasmic sequence, a
28-residue transmembrane domain, a stem region, a large catalytic
domain, and 2 potential N-glycosylation sites. Northern blot analysis
detected ubiquitous expression of a 2.2-kb transcript at high levels in
fetal brain and kidney and adult brain and at lower levels in adult
thymus, peripheral blood leukocytes, lung, and liver. Functional
analysis confirmed that the cloned product is
i-beta-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase.

GENE FUNCTION

In a review, Yu et al. (2001) noted that the N-acetyllactosamine
(LacNAc) repeats present in the i/I antigens (110800) are synthesized by
the sequential action of B3GNT1 and beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase (see
B4GALT1; 137060).

Lee et al. (2009) stated that B3GNT1 and B4GALT1 (137060) alternately
add N-acetylglucosamine and galactose residues, respectively, to
synthesize poly-N-acetyllactosamine, a linear carbohydrate that can be
incorporated into either N- or O-linked glycans. Using transfected HeLa
and COS-1 cells for immunofluorescence and coimmunoprecipitation
analysis, they found that B3GNT1 and B4GALT1 interact directly and
colocalize to the Golgi. Addition of an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
retention signal to the C terminus of either enzyme caused
relocalization of both to the ER.

Alpha-dystroglycan (DAG1; 128239) is a highly N- and O-glycosylated
molecule that is expressed on epithelial cells and mediates epithelial
cell-basement membrane interactions. Bao et al. (2009) found that B3GNT1
formed a complex with and cooperated with LARGE (603590) and LARGE2
(GYLTL1B; 609709) in the synthesis of laminin (see 156225)-binding
glycans on alpha-dystroglycan. B3GNT1 did not form a complex with LARGE
or LARGE2 when the proteins were mixed in vitro. Mutation analysis
revealed that DxD motifs in B3GNT1 and LARGE were required for the
interactions and for synthesis of laminin-binding glycans on
alpha-dystroglycan. B3GNT1 was required for enzymatic activity of the
complex. Knockdown of B3GNT1 reduced synthesis of laminin-binding
glycans and increased cell migration and tumor formation by cancer cell
lines. Conversely, overexpression of B3GNT1 reduced cell migration and
tumor formation.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the IGNT
gene to chromosome 11 (TMAP sts-W44699).

Hartz (2013) mapped the B3GNT1 gene to chromosome 11q13.2 based on an
alignment of the B3GNT1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF029893) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37). Wright et al. (2012) mapped the mouse B3gnt1
gene to chromosome 19.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 4 sibs of East Indian descent with congenital muscular
dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy with brain and eye anomalies (MDDGA13;
615287), Buysse et al. (2013) identified homozygosity for 2 missense
mutations in the B3GNT1 gene (605517.0001). The mutations, which were
found by homozygosity mapping and candidate gene analysis, segregated
with the disorder and were not found in 5,379 control samples or 672
in-house control exomes. Both mutations were located in the conserved
glycosyltransferase domain of the protein and were shown to result in
reduced glycosylation compared to wildtype when expressed in cells,
consistent with a loss of function. Morpholino knockdown of B3gnt1 in
zebrafish resulted in little or no glycosylated alpha-dystroglycan (DAG;
128239), and morphant embryos showed signs of muscular dystrophy. In
this family, 3 pregnancies were terminated and 1 affected son died at 2
years of age. The living patient showed severe hypotonia with increased
serum creatine kinase and developed intractable seizures. All patients
had retinal dysplasia and severe brain malformations, including
hydrocephalus, brainstem and cerebellar hypoplasia, nodular heterotopia,
and cobblestone lissencephaly. Mutations in B3GNT1 were not found in 57
additional families with dystroglycanopathy, suggesting that it is a
rare cause of these disorders.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using mice generated in an N-ethyl-N-nitrosurea (ENU) mutagenesis
screen, Wright et al. (2012) found that point mutations in B3gnt1 and
Ispd (614631) caused similar defects in axon guidance and branching,
with abnormal hindbrain axonal tracts and severe defasciculation of the
spinal cord dorsal funiculus. The ENU-generated met155-to-thr (M155T)
substitution in B3gnt1 was a hypomorphic allele that resulted in a
mutant protein that did not localize to the Golgi, but was retained in
the ER. M155T mutant mice were born at the expected mendelian ratio and
displayed a mild muscular dystrophy phenotype with incomplete
penetrance. In contrast, knockout of B3gnt1 resulted in embryonic
lethality by embryonic day 9.5. Wright et al. (2012) found that
defective axonal guidance in both B3gnt1 and Ispd mutant mice was due to
defective glycosylation of dystroglycan (DAG1; 128239) and absence of
interaction between unglycosylated dystroglycan and the axonal guidance
molecule Slit (see 603742).

Buysse et al. (2013) found that morpholino knockdown of B3gnt1 in
zebrafish resulted in little or no glycosylated alpha-dystroglycan.
Morphant embryos showed disruption of muscle fiber organization and
structure, with muscle fiber detachment, discontinuous myotendinous
junctions, and elongated muscle fibers spanning the myosepta. There was
evidence of muscle degeneration with a loss of sarcolemma integrity in
b3gnt1 morphant embryos.

MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY-DYSTROGLYCANOPATHY (CONGENITAL WITH BRAIN AND EYE
ANOMALIES), TYPE A, 13 (1 family)
B3GNT1, ASN390ASP AND ALA406VAL

In 4 sibs of East Indian descent with congenital muscular
dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy with brain and eye anomalies (MDDGA13;
615287), Buysse et al. (2013) identified homozygosity for 2 mutations in
the B3GNT1 gene: a c.1168A-G transition resulting in an asn390-to-asp
(N390D) substitution, and a c.1217C-T transition resulting in an
ala406-to val (A406V) substitution. The mutations, which were found by
homozygosity mapping and candidate gene analysis, segregated with the
disorder and were not found in 5,379 control samples or 672 in-house
control exomes. Both mutations were located in the conserved
glycosyltransferase domain of the protein and were shown to result in
reduced glycosylation compared to wildtype when expressed in cells,
consistent with a loss of function.

611952	TITLE *611952 VACUOLAR PROTEIN SORTING 28, YEAST, HOMOLOG OF; VPS28
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Class E vacuolar protein sorting (VPS) proteins, such as VPS28, are
required for appropriate sorting of receptors within the endocytic
pathway (Bishop and Woodman, 2001).

CLONING

By searching EST databases for homologs of yeast Vps28, Bishop and
Woodman (2001) identified human VPS28 and several invertebrate homologs.
The 221-amino acid human protein shares 28% amino acid identity with
yeast Vps28. RT-PCR analysis revealed ubiquitous expression of a single
VPS28 transcript in human tissues. Immunofluorescence and confocal
microscopy showed that VPS28 was exclusively cytosolic.

GENE FUNCTION

Using coimmunoprecipitation and crosslinking analysis, Bishop and
Woodman (2001) found that human VPS28 interacted with the coiled-coil
C-terminal portion of TSG101 (601387). Expression of ATPase-defective
VPS4 (609983) shifted a portion of TSG101 and VPS28 from the cytosol to
endosomal vacuoles. Bishop and Woodman (2001) concluded that TSG101 and
VPS28 are directly involved in endosomal sorting.

Philips et al. (2008) showed that the avirulent Mycobacterium smegmatis
species could multiply in Drosophila S2 cells or murine macrophages in
which small interfering RNA had disrupted components of the ESCRT
(endosomal sorting complex required for transport) complex, including
Tsg101 and Vps28, by modulating the phagosome induced by mycobacteria.
Immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy showed that Tsg101- or
Vps28-depleted cells harbored mycobacteria in a heavily ubiquitinated
vacuolar location. Philips et al. (2008) concluded that ESCRT machinery
is critical for containment of mycobacterial proliferation.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the VPS28
gene to chromosome 8 (TMAP A006J21).

611432	TITLE *611432 DEDICATOR OF CYTOKINESIS 8; DOCK8
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

DOCK8 is a member of the DOCK180-related (DOCK1; 601403) protein family
(Ruusala and Aspenstrom, 2004).

CLONING

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis using CDC42 (116952) as bait, followed by PCR
of a Daudi cell cDNA library, Ruusala and Aspenstrom (2004) cloned
DOCK8. They identified transcripts encoding a 1,701-amino acid protein
with a calculated molecular mass of 190 kD and a 2,031-amino acid
protein. DOCK8 contains the CZH1 and CZH2 domains characteristic of
DOCK180-related proteins and shares 58% amino acid identity with DOCK7.
Northern blot analysis detected an 8-kb transcript in placenta, lung,
kidney, and pancreas with low expression in heart, brain, and skeletal
muscle and a 9-kb transcript with very low expression in placenta, lung,
and kidney. Immunofluorescence localized transiently transfected and
endogenous DOCK8 to the cytoplasm at cell edges in areas undergoing
lamellipodia formation, which increased when cells were treated with
PDGF (see 190040) or fetal calf serum. Transient transfection of a
C-terminal fragment of DOCK8 resulted in formation of vesicular
structures, which also contained filamentous actin, suggesting that
DOCK8 may play a role in the organization of filamentous actin.

By Northern blot analysis of human adult and fetal tissues, Griggs et
al. (2008) detected expression of an 8.0-kb transcript in all tissues
examined, including adult and fetal brain with variable expression in
specific brain regions tested. RT-PCR analysis detected variable
expression of a splice variant containing exon 13a and 14a and a splice
variant containing exon 13b but lacking exon 16.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Ruusala and Aspenstrom (2004) showed that
DOCK8 interacted with GTP- and GDP-bound forms of CDC42, Rac1 (602048)
mutants L61 and N17, and RHOJ (607653) and RHOQ (605857). None of these
interactions was detected using GST pull-down assay, suggesting that the
interaction between DOCK and Rho GTPases may be too transient to allow
stable interaction in this assay.

By quantitative RT-PCR analysis, Zhang et al. (2009) identified DOCK8
expression in monocytes, B cells, and T cells from healthy blood donors.
High levels were found in activated, expanded primary T-cell cultures
and transformed lymphocyte lines.

GENE STRUCTURE

Griggs et al. (2008) determined that the DOCK8 gene contains 47 exons
spanning 190 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Griggs et al. (2008) mapped the DOCK8 gene
to chromosome 9p24.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Autosomal Dominant Mental Retardation 2

Griggs et al. (2008) reported 2 unrelated patients with mental
retardation and developmental disability (MRD2; 614113) associated with
heterozygous disruption of the DOCK8 gene by deletion and by a
translocation breakpoint, respectively. Mapping of the critical region
shared by the 2 patients showed truncation of the longest isoform of
DOCK8. One patient was a 55-year-old man with profound mental
retardation, no speech, mild dysmorphic features, a history of seizures,
and stooped posture. He had a genomic deletion of approximately 230 kb
in subtelomeric 9p. The second patient was a girl with anhidrotic
ectodermal dysplasia (ED1; 305100) previously reported by MacDermot and
Hulten (1990). She carried a de novo balanced translocation
t(X;9)(q13.1;p24), which also interrupted the EDA gene (300451). She was
reported to have delayed speech and psychomotor development, but
attended a special school.

- Autosomal Recessive Hyper-IgE Recurrent Infection Syndrome

In 11 affected individuals from 8 unrelated families with autosomal
recessive hyper-IgE syndrome with recurrent infections (243700), Zhang
et al. (2009) identified homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for
deletions or mutations in the DOCK8 gene (see, e.g.,
611432.0001-611432.0005). Patients had recurrent and severe bacterial,
viral, and fungal infections, atopic dermatitis, and food and
environmental allergies. Several developed viral-associated carcinomas.
Laboratory studies showed decreased levels of T cells, variable decrease
in B cells, and increased serum IgE. All the DOCK8 mutations resulted in
loss of protein function. DOCK8 protein was not detected in primary T
cell cultures or transformed lymphocyte lines from all 11 patients
tested. CD8 T cells showed impaired proliferation and activation, with
normal cytotoxic activity.

homozygous 1214A-G transition in the DOCK8 gene, resulting in a
lys405-to-arg (K405R) substitution. The patients had atopic dermatitis,
recurrent bacterial, viral, and fungal infections, and multiple food and
environmental allergies. One died at age 18 years. Patient T-cell
cultures showed minimal amounts of a mutant protein, and CD8 T cells
showed poor expansion and activation. However, CD8 T cell cytotoxic
function appeared to be normal, and CD4 T cells showed normal
proliferation.

identified a homozygous large deletion (921_2765del) in the DOCK8 gene,
resulting in the deletion of exons 10 through 23. She had atopic
dermatitis, recurrent bacterial, viral, and fungal infections, and food
and environmental allergies. Patient T-cell cultures showed minimal
amounts of a truncated mutant protein, and CD8 T cells showed poor
expansion and activation. However, CD8 T cell cytotoxic function
appeared to be normal, and CD4 T cells showed normal proliferation.

homozygous large deletion (426_3017del) in the DOCK8 gene, resulting in
the deletion of exons 5 through 24. He had atopic dermatitis, recurrent
bacterial and viral infections, and multiple food and environmental
allergies. He died of metastatic anal squamous cell carcinoma at age 21
years. The DOCK8 protein was not detected in primary T-cell cultures.

frameshift mutations in the DOCK8 gene: a 1-bp deletion (c.3290delC) and

609437	TITLE *609437 SERINE/THREONINE PROTEIN KINASE 40; STK40
;;SINK-HOMOLOGOUS INHIBITORY KINASE; SHIK
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching databases for sequences similar to SINK (TRIB3), Huang et
al. (2003) identified STK40, which they called SHIK. The deduced
435-amino acid protein has a central serine/threonine protein kinase
domain and shares significant homology with SINK. Northern blot analysis
detected strong SHIK expression in all tissues examined. Western blot
analysis detected a 55-kD endogenous SHIK protein in human embryonic
kidney cells. Immunofluorescent staining localized endogenous SHIK to
the cytoplasm and nucleus of human embryonic kidney cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Huang et al. (2003) determined that SHIK inhibited TNF
(191160)-dependent activation of NFKB (see 164011). SHIK also inhibited
p53 (TP53; 191170) in a dose-dependent manner in a reporter gene assay.
Mutation of asp197 to ile abolished the ability of SHIK to inhibit
p53-mediated transcription and resulted in a SHIK protein that
potentiated p53-mediated transcription.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the STK40
gene to chromosome 1 (TMAP SHGC-74578).

602016	TITLE *602016 KRUPPEL-LIKE FACTOR 2; KLF2
;;LUNG KRUPPEL-LIKE ZINC FINGER TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR; LKLF
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Kruppel-like factors (KLFs) are zinc finger transcription factors that
play key roles in differentiation, quiescence, and homeostasis of many
cell lineages. KLF2 promotes T-cell quiescence, in part by reducing MYC
(190080) expression. KLF2 also regulates T-cell migration by controlling
expression of key regulators of T-cell trafficking, including S1P1
(S1PR1; 601974) and CD62L (SELL; 153240) (summary by Richardson et al.,
2012).

CLONING

Anderson et al. (1995) identified and characterized the gene for a novel
zinc finger transcription factor that they symbolized LKLF for 'lung
Kruppel-like factor.'

Using 5-prime and 3-prime RACE on a melted GC-rich DNA fragment similar
to mouse Lklf, Kozyrev et al. (1999) isolated a cDNA encoding KLF2,
which they termed LKLF. Sequence analysis predicted that the 355-amino
acid LKLF protein, which is 87% identical to the mouse protein, has
N-terminal proline-rich repeats, a putative activation domain, a
potential nuclear localization signal, and a C-terminal zinc finger
domain.

By EST database searching and RACE, Wani et al. (1999) obtained a cDNA
encoding KLF2. Northern blot analysis revealed highest expression of a
1.8-kb transcript in heart, with lower levels in lung, skeletal muscle,
pancreas, and placenta; no expression was detected in brain, liver, or
kidney.

GENE FUNCTION

Buckley et al. (2001) showed that expression of LKLF in a T-cell line
induced reversible quiescence resulting in marked inhibition of
proliferation, decreases in cell size and protein synthesis, and reduced
expression of activation markers. They concluded that LKLF functions, in
part, by negatively regulating a MYC (190080)-dependent pathway.

To determine the mechanism of increased sensitivity to TNF
(191160)-induced apoptosis in Traf2 (601895)-null cells, Lin et al.
(2003) used microarray analysis to identify genes abnormally expressed
in Traf2-null mouse fibroblasts. They found that expression of Lklf was
dramatically decreased in Traf2-null fibroblasts. Ectopic expression of
Lklf protected Traf2-null cells from TNF-induced apoptosis. The results
suggested that TRAF2 regulates LKLF expression through a
mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 (600289) pathway.

By microarray analysis, Parmar et al. (2006) found that KLF2 was induced
in human umbilical vein endothelial cells exposed to biomechanical
stress characteristic of blood flow in regions of the human carotid
artery that are relatively resistant to atherogenesis. Flow-mediated
increase in KLF2 expression occurred via the MEK5 (MAP2K5; 602520)-ERK5
(MAPK7; 602521)-MEF2 (see MEF2A; 600660) signaling pathway.
Overexpression and silencing of KLF2 in the context of flow, combined
with analysis of gene expression, demonstrated that induction of KLF2
results in the regulation of endothelial genes controlling inflammation,
thrombosis/hemostasis, vascular tone, and blood vessel development.
Parmar et al. (2006) also found that KLF2 modulated IL1B
(147720)-mediated endothelial activation. The authors concluded that
KLF2 is a mechanically activated transcription factor that integrates
multiple endothelial functions associated with resistance to
atherogenesis.

Carlson et al. (2006) showed that KLF2 is essential for T-cell
trafficking. KLF2-deficient thymocytes show impaired expression of
several receptors required for thymocyte emigration and peripheral
trafficking, including the sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor S1P1 (EDG1;
601974), CD62L (153240), and beta-7 integrin (147559). Carlson et al.
(2006) showed also that KLF2 binds and transactivates the promoter for
S1P1, a receptor that is critical for thymocyte egress and recirculation
through peripheral lymphoid organs. Carlson et al. (2006) suggested that
KLF2 serves to license mature T cells for trafficking from the thymus
and recirculation through lymphoid tissues.

Vermot et al. (2009) exploited the relationship between oscillatory flow
and heart rate to manipulate the amount of retrograde flow in the
atrioventricular canal before and during valvulogenesis in zebrafish.
They found that decreased retrograde flow leads to arrested valve
growth. Using this manipulation, the authors determined that klf2a is
normally expressed in the valve precursors in response to reversing
flows and that it is dramatically reduced by treatments that decrease
such flows. Experimentally knocking down the expression of this
shear-responsive gene with morpholine antisense oligonucleotides
resulted in dysfunctional valves. Thus, Vermot et al. (2009) concluded
that KLF2A expression appears to be necessary for normal valve
formation. This, together with its dependence on intracardiac
hemodynamic forces, makes KLF2A expression an early and reliable
indicator of proper valve development. Vermot et al. (2009) concluded
that their results demonstrated a critical role for reversing flows
during valvulogenesis and showed how relatively subtle perturbations of
normal hemodynamic patterns can lead to both major alterations in gene
expression and severe valve dysgenesis.

To investigate the process of angiogenesis, Nicoli et al. (2010) studied
aortic arch blood vessels in zebrafish, which are known to remodel in
response to blood flow. By using 2-photon imaging of live zebrafish
embryos, Nicoli et al. (2010) observed that flow is essential for
angiogenesis during aortic arch development. They found that angiogenic
sprouting of aortic arch vessels requires a flow-induced genetic pathway
in which the mechanosensitive zinc finger transcription factor klf2a
induces expression of an endothelial-specific microRNA, mir126 (611767),
to activate Vegf (192240) signaling. Nicoli et al. (2010) concluded that
their work describes a novel genetic mechanism in which a microRNA
facilitates integration of a physiologic stimulus with growth factor
signaling in endothelial cells to guide angiogenesis.

Pei et al. (2011) generated knockin mice expressing point mutations in
both receptor-interacting domains (RIDs) of Smrt (NCOR2; 600848), which
disrupted its interaction with nuclear receptors. On a pure C57BL/6J
background, these mice, which Pei et al. (2011) called Smrt(mRID) mice,
died shortly after birth from acute respiratory distress syndrome due to
abnormal terminal differentiation of type I pneumocytes. Maternal
delivery of antithyroid drugs, but not antagonists of other nuclear
receptors, rescued lethality in Smrt(mRID) pups. Mice treated with
antithyroid drugs during the time of terminal lung differentiation were
born alive, showed no evidence of respiratory distress, and survived to
adulthood. Microarray analysis revealed that Klf2 expression was
downregulated in Smrt(mRID) mice. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis
of MLE-12 mouse lung carcinoma cells showed that both Smrt and thyroid
hormone receptor (see 190120) bound a conserved enhancer region
downstream of the mouse Klf2 gene. Overexpression of Klf2 in MLE-12
cells upregulated expression of type I pneumocyte markers, and targeted
disruption of Klf2 in mouse lung recapitulated the phenotype of
Smrt(mRID) mice. Pei et al. (2011) concluded that regulation of KLF2
expression by SMRT is required for terminal lung development.

Thymocyte emigration after positive selection requires KLF2 expression.
Although KLF2 expression by endothelial cells requires ERK5, which is
phosphorylated in response to IL7 (146660), Weinreich et al. (2011)
found that Erk5-deficient mouse T cells underwent normal development and
had no Klf2 deficiency. They concluded that IL7 and ERK5 do not control
KLF2 or the semimature to mature single-positive thymocyte transition.

CCR5 (601373) is a cell surface molecule critical for the transmission
and spread of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 (see 609423).
Richardson et al. (2012) found that CD4-positive T cells stimulated with
phytohemagglutinin plus IL2 (147680) had increased expression of KLF2
and CCR5 and increased susceptibility to infection with HIV-1 compared
with T cells stimulated with immobilized anti-CD3 (see 186740) and
anti-CD28 (186760). Enhanced expression of KLF2 did not regulate
expression of chemokine receptor ligands (e.g., CCL3; 182283) that
downregulate CCR5 expression. Knockdown of KLF2 in CD4-positive T cells
via small interfering RNA resulted in reduced CCR5 expression. Chromatin
immunoprecipitation analysis showed that KLF2 bound to the CCR5 promoter
in resting, but not CD3/CD28-activated, CD4-positive T cells.
Transduction of KLF2 induced CCR5 in some, but not all, transformed
T-cell lines. CCR5 upregulation after KLF2 transduction restored
susceptibility to CCR5-tropic HIV-1 in the Jurkat T-cell line, which
expresses little to no KLF2. Richardson et al. (2012) concluded that
KLF2 is a host factor that modulates CCR5 expression in CD4-positive T
cells and influences susceptibility to CCR5-tropic viruses.

GENE STRUCTURE

By PCR and genomic sequence analysis, Kozyrev et al. (1999) and Wani et
al. (1999) determined that the LKLF gene contains 3 exons and spans more
than 3 kb. The 5-prime flanking region has features of a GC-rich
promoter with multiple SP1-binding sites, but it also has 2 putative
TATA boxes.

MAPPING

Kozyrev et al. (1999) mapped the KLF2 gene to chromosome
19p13.13-p13.11, close to the KLF1 gene (600599), by radiation hybrid
analysis. Wani et al. (1999) mapped the KLF2 gene to 19p13.1 by somatic
cell hybrid analysis and FISH.

ANIMAL MODEL

Mature single-positive (i.e., CD4 (186940)-positive or CD8 (see
186910)-positive) T lymphocytes enter a 'resting' state in which they
are proliferatively quiescent and relatively resistant to apoptosis. Kuo
et al. (1997) found that the expression of Lklf is developmentally
induced in mice during the maturation of single-positive quiescent T
cells and rapidly extinguished after activation of these cells.
Lklf-deficient mouse T cells produced by gene targeting had a
spontaneously activated phenotype and died in the spleen and lymph nodes
from apoptosis induced by Fas ligand (FASL; 134638). Thus, the authors
concluded that LKLF is required to program the quiescent state of
single-positive T cells and to maintain their viability in the
peripheral lymphoid organs and blood. As pointed out by Freitas and
Rocha (1997), the work suggests that the survival of naive T cells is an
active process, probably dependent on the expression of particular sets
of genes by resting T cells.

Lee et al. (2006) found that Klf2 expression during mouse embryonic
development mirrored the rise of fluid shear forces, and that
conditional deletion of Klf2 in endothelial and hematopoietic cells
resulted in lethal embryonic heart failure due to high cardiac output.
Klf2 deficiency did not result in anemia or structural vascular defects,
and it could be rescued by administration of phenylephrine, a
catecholamine that raises vessel tone. Lee et al. (2006) concluded that
KLF2 is an essential hemodynamic regulator in vivo, and that hemodynamic
regulation in response to fluid shear stress is required for
cardiovascular development and function.

Using mice with a T cell-specific deficiency in Klf2 and flow cytometric
analysis, Weinreich et al. (2009) demonstrated upregulation of Cxcr3
(300574) in Klf2-deficient T cells, as well as on wildtype bystander
cells in mixed bone marrow chimeras. Klf2-deficient T cells also
overproduced Il4 (147780), leading to upregulation of Cxcr3,
particularly on naive Cd8 thymocytes and T cells, through an Il4r
(147781)- and eomesodermin (EOMES; 604615)-dependent pathway. Weinreich
et al. (2009) concluded that KLF2 is important in regulating naive
T-cell identity, promoting T-cell recirculation through secondary
lymphoid organs, and repressing rapid cytokine production.

;;DENDRITIC CELL-SPECIFIC ICAM3-GRABBING NONINTEGRIN; DCSIGN;;
HIV GP120-BINDING PROTEIN;;
C-TYPE LECTIN DOMAIN FAMILY 4, MEMBER L; CLEC4L
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The C-type lectin receptors are involved in the primary interface
between host and pathogens. Two prototypic members of the C-type
lectin-receptor family act as both cell-adhesion receptors and
pathogen-recognition receptors: CD209 and its close relative CD209L
(CLEC4M; 605872) (review by Barreiro et al., 2005).

CLONING

The binding of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) envelope
glycoprotein gp120 to the cell surface receptor CD4 (186940) had been
considered a primary determinant of viral tropism (see 609423). A number
of cell types, however, can be infected by the virus, or bind gp120, in
the absence of CD4 expression. Human placenta had been identified as a
tissue that binds gp120 in a CD4-independent manner. By expression
cloning, Curtis et al. (1992) screened a placenta cDNA library and
isolated a cDNA (clone 11) encoding a gp120-binding protein unrelated to
CD4. The 1.3-kb cDNA predicts a 404-amino acid protein with a calculated
molecular mass of 45,775 Da. The gp120-binding protein is organized into
3 domains: an N-terminal cytoplasmic and hydrophobic region, a set of
tandem repeats (7 complete and 1 incomplete), and a C-terminal domain
with homology to C-type (calcium-dependent) lectins. A type II membrane
orientation (N-terminal cytoplasmic) was predicted both by the cDNA
sequence and by the reactivity of C-terminal peptide-specific antiserum
with the surface of clone 11-transfected cells. Native and recombinant
gp120 and whole virus bound transfected cells. Gp120 binding was high
affinity (Kd, 1.3 to 1.6 nM) and was inhibited by mannan, D-mannose, and
L-fucose; once bound, gp120 was internalized rapidly. These data
demonstrated that the gp120-binding protein is a membrane-associated
mannose-binding lectin. Curtis et al. (1992) suggested that proteins of
this type may play an important role in the CD4-independent association
of HIV with cells.

Contact between dendritic cells (DCs) and resting T cells is essential
to initiate a primary immune response. Geijtenbeek et al. (2000)
demonstrated that intercellular adhesion molecule-3 (ICAM3; 146631)
expressed by resting T cells is important in this first contact with
DCs. They discovered that instead of the common ICAM3 receptors LFA1
(see 153370) and alpha-D-beta-2, a novel DC-specific C-type lectin,
which they called DCSIGN (DC-specific ICAM3-grabbing nonintegrin), binds
ICAM3 with high affinity. DCSIGN is a type II transmembrane protein
consisting of 404 amino acids with 3 distinct domains. The 40-amino acid
N-terminal cytoplasmic domain is separated by a hydrophobic stretch of
15 amino acids from a region consisting of 1 incomplete and 7 complete
tandem repeats of nearly identical sequence. The extracellular
C-terminal region (cys253 to ala404) shows homology to C-type lectins.
Sequence analysis revealed that DCSIGN is identical to the HIV-1
gp120-binding protein described by Curtis et al. (1992). DCSIGN, which
is abundantly expressed by DCs both in vitro and in vivo, mediates
transient adhesion with T cells. Since antibodies against DCSIGN
inhibited DC-induced proliferation of resting T cells, these findings
predicted that DCSIGN enables T-cell receptor engagement by
stabilization of the DC/T-cell contact zone.

Soilleux et al. (2000) also cloned CD209. They noted that CD209 has
dileucine and YXXL internalization motifs in its cytoplasmic tail. It
also contains extracellular carbohydrate recognition domains, which are
involved in calcium-dependent mannose binding, that are encoded by 3
separate exons, a structure also found in CD23 (151445). RT-PCR analysis
detected CD209 expression in placenta and, at lower levels, in
endometrium and a DC line.

GENE FUNCTION

DCs capture microorganisms that enter peripheral mucosal tissues, and
then migrate to secondary lymphoid organs, where they present these in
antigenic form to resting T cells, thus initiating adaptive immune
responses. Geijtenbeek et al. (2000) described the properties of DCSIGN,
which is highly expressed on DCs present in mucosal tissues and binds to
the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120. DCSIGN does not function as a
receptor for viral entry into DCs but instead promotes efficient
infection in trans of cells that express CD4 and chemokine receptors.
Geijtenbeek et al. (2000) proposed that DCSIGN efficiently captures
HIV-1 in the periphery and facilitates its transport to secondary
lymphoid organs rich in T cells, to enhance infection in trans of these
target cells.

Dengue virus (DV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that primarily targets
DCs and causes hemorrhagic fever in humans (see 614371). Navarro-Sanchez
et al. (2003) found that anti-DCSIGN and the soluble tetrameric
ectodomain of DCSIGN inhibited DV infection. The data indicated that
DCSIGN functions as a DV-binding lectin that interacts as an attachment
factor with the DV envelope glycoprotein.

Using primary DCs naturally expressing DCSIGN and cell lines transfected
with DCSIGN or its liver/lymph node-specific homolog, LSIGN (CD209L;
605872), Tassaneetrithep et al. (2003) showed that extensive infection
by all 4 DV serotypes was dependent on expression of these lectins.
Fluorescence microscopy indicated that DV infection could be blocked by
antibody to DCSIGN but not by antibodies to other molecules expressed on
DCs. Mutation analysis indicated that the cytoplasmic domain of DCSIGN
enhanced but was not essential for infection. Because of the wide array
of pathogens whose infectivity is DCSIGN-dependent, Tassaneetrithep et
al. (2003) proposed that DCSIGN recognizes pathogen-associated microbial
patterns, or PAMPs.

Geijtenbeek et al. (2003) found that DCSIGN captured and internalized
intact Mycobacterium bovis BCG or avirulent M. tuberculosis (see 607948)
through the glycolipid mycobacterial cell wall component ManLAM. Both
bacilli and ManLAM were targeted to lysosomes and colocalized with LAMP1
(153330) in immature DCs. Antibodies against DCSIGN blocked BCG
infection of DCs. Binding of secreted ManLAM to DCSIGN prevented
mycobacteria- or LPS-induced DC maturation and induced IL10 (124092)
production, suggesting that DCSIGN-ManLAM interaction may interfere with
TLR-mediated signaling and development of an antiinflammatory response.
Geijtenbeek et al. (2003) proposed that M. tuberculosis may target
DCSIGN both to infect DCs and to downregulate DC-mediated immune
responses.

Tailleux et al. (2003) showed that M. tuberculosis entered DCs after
binding to DCSIGN, whereas the major macrophage receptors for M.
tuberculosis, CR3 (see ITGAM; 120980) and MRC1 (153618), played only a
minor role in DC infection. Flow cytometric and histopathologic analyses
showed expression of DCSIGN on lung DCs from uninfected patients and on
lymph node granuloma cells infected with M. tuberculosis.

Using flow cytometric analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage cells from
tuberculosis (TB), asthma, and sarcoidosis patients and control
individuals, Tailleux et al. (2005) found that most alveolar macrophages
from TB patients expressed DCSIGN, whereas the lectin was barely
detected in cells from the other subjects. FACS, RT-PCR, and ELISA
analyses indicated that M. tuberculosis infection induced DCSIGN
expression by a mechanism independent of TLR4 (603030), IL4 (147780),
and IL13 (147683). Immunohistochemical analysis showed bacillary
concentration in lung regions enriched in DCSIGN-expressing alveolar
macrophages. Binding experiments revealed that DCSIGN-expressing
alveolar macrophages were preferential targets for M. tuberculosis
compared with DCSIGN-negative cells. Tailleux et al. (2005) did not
detect IL10 in bronchoalveolar lavage or induction of IL10 in infected
cells.

The 2 lectin-coding genes CD209 and CD209L resulted from a duplication
of an ancestral gene (Bashirova et al., 2003; Soilleux, 2003). An
additional characteristic of both CD209 and CD209L is the presence of a
neck region, primarily made up of 7 highly conserved 23-amino acid
repeats, that separates the carbohydrate-recognition domain involved in
pathogen binding from the transmembrane domain. This neck region
presents high nucleotide identity between repeats, both within each
molecule and between CD209 and CD209L. This region plays a crucial role
in the oligomerization and support of the carbohydrate-recognition
domain; therefore, it influences the pathogen-binding properties of
these 2 receptors (Barreiro et al., 2005). CD209 is expressed primarily
on phagocytic cells such as dendritic cells and macrophages, whereas
CD209L expression is restricted to endothelial cells in liver and lymph
nodes.

By challenging DCs with different phleboviruses, including Rift Valley
fever and Uukuniemi viruses, in the presence or absence of antibody to
DCSIGN, Lozach et al. (2011) demonstrated that DCSIGN was required for
DC infection. Cells lacking DCSIGN resisted phlebovirus challenge, but
they became susceptible when transfected with DCSIGN. Binding by DCSIGN,
which was followed by virus internalization and infection, occurred via
interactions with high-mannose N-glycans on viral glycoproteins.
Mutation of DCSIGN to ablate endocytosis prevented infection. Lozach et
al. (2011) concluded that DCSIGN is a phlebovirus entry receptor.

Lefevre et al. (2013) observed increased mRNA and protein expression for
the C-lectin receptors dectin-1 (CLEC7A; 606264), Mr (MRC1), and Signr3,
a mouse homolog of CD209, in mice infected with Leishmania infantum (Li)
(see 608207). Mice lacking dectin-1 or Mr, but not those lacking Signr3,
had higher parasite levels in blood and spleen. Peritoneal macrophages
from dectin-1 -/- or Mrc1 -/- mice, but not Signr3 -/- mice, permitted
Li growth and exhibited poor production of reactive oxygen species
(ROS). ROS production required dectin-1-Syk (600085)-p47-phox (NCF1;
608512) phosphorylation and Mr-arachidonic acid-Nadph oxidase (NOX1;
300225) membrane translocation. Dectin-1 and Mr facilitated release of
Il1b (147720) induced by Casp1 (147678) in response to Li infection,
whereas Il1b was downregulated by Signr3 through Lta4h (151570). In
human macrophages, small interfering RNA-mediated inactivation of CLEC7A
and MRC1, but not CD209, resulted in responses to Li similar to those
observed in mice. Lefevre et al. (2013) concluded that
Leishmania-macrophage interaction is influenced by the stage of
macrophage polarization (i.e., by cytokine and stimulatory milieu) and
by members of the C-lectin receptor family. They proposed that
alteration of these cellular and molecular factors may benefit patient
responses.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Feinberg et al. (2001) generated crystal structures of DCSIGN and
DCSIGNR and showed that the carbohydrate-recognition domains (CRDs) of
both are specific for high-mannose N-linked oligosaccharides, such as
those present on the envelope of HIV-1. One monomer of the DCSIGN pair
of CRDs interacts with the terminal N-acetylglucosamine of GlcNAc1,
while the partner monomer of DCSIGNR is bound to Ca+. Feinberg et al.
(2001) proposed that the mechanistic basis of DCSIGN- and
DCSIGNR-oligosaccharide interaction provides a starting point to the
design of both therapeutic and prophylactic attacks on HIV-1 infection.

Using cryoelectron microscopy, Pokidysheva et al. (2006) determined the
structure of DV serotype-2 (DV2) in complex with the CRD of human DCSIGN
at 25-angstrom resolution. The structure showed that 1 CRD monomer binds
to 2 glycosylation sites at asn67 of 2 neighboring DV envelope
glycoproteins in each icosahedral asymmetric unit. The vacancy at the
third asn67 site leaves space for primary DV receptor binding to domain
III of the envelope protein. Pokidysheva et al. (2006) suggested that
the use of carbohydrate moieties for receptor binding sites may be a
mechanism for avoiding immune surveillance.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Soilleux et al. (2000) determined that the
CD209 gene contains 7 exons.

MAPPING

Soilleux et al. (2000) mapped the CD209 gene to 19p13.3, in a cluster
with the CD209L (605872) and CD23 genes, by radiation hybrid analysis.

The lectin-coding genes CD209 and CD209L, which resulted from a
duplication of an ancestral gene, are located within a segment of
approximately 26 kb (Barreiro et al., 2005).

EVOLUTION

The innate immunity system constitutes the first line of host defense
against pathogens. Two closely related innate immunity genes, CD209 and
CD209L, directly recognize a cluster of pathogens, including bacteria,
viruses, and parasites. To explore the extent to which pathogens have
exerted selective pressure on these innate immunity genes, Barreiro et
al. (2005) resequenced them in a group of samples from sub-Saharan
Africa, Europe, and East Asia. Moreover, variation in the number of
repeats in the neck region was defined in the entire Human Genome
Diversity Panel for both genes. The results, which were based on
diversity levels, neutrality tests, population genetic distances, and
neck-region length variation, provided genetic evidence that CD209 has
been under a strong selective constraint that prevents accumulation of
any amino acid changes, whereas CD209L variability has most likely been
shaped by the action of balancing selection in non-African populations.
In addition, the data pointed to the neck region as the functional
target of such selective pressures: CD209 presented a constant size in
the neck region populationwide, whereas CD209L presented an excess of
length variation, particularly in non-African populations. An additional
interesting observation came from the coalescent-based CD209 gene tree,
whose binary typology and time depth (approximately 2.8 million years
ago) were compatible with an ancestral population structure in Africa.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Martin et al. (2004) found that European Americans at risk for
parenteral HIV infection were more likely to carry the -336C SNP than
the -336T SNP (604672.0001) in the promoter of DCSIGN. This association
was not observed in those at risk for mucosally acquired infection.
Although the -336C SNP was common in African Americans, no significant
association with risk of infection was observed in this group.

Sakuntabhai et al. (2005) found that the same CD209 promoter
polymorphism reported by Martin et al. (2004), which Sakuntabhai et al.
(2005) called -336A-G, was associated with severity of dengue disease
(614371). Specifically, the G allele of the variant was associated with
strong protection against dengue fever as opposed to dengue hemorrhagic
fever. These results indicated that CD209 has a crucial role in dengue
pathogenesis, which discriminates between severe dengue fever and dengue
hemorrhagic fever.

Barreiro et al. (2006) examined CD209 polymorphisms in 351 TB patients
and 360 healthy controls from a South African Coloured population
(historically derived from Khoisan, Malaysian, Bantu, and European
descent populations) living in communities with some of the highest
reported incidence rates of TB in the world. They identified 2 CD209
promoter variants, -871A (604672.0002) and -336G, that were associated
with increased risk of TB. One haplotype of 8 SNPs, including -871G and
-336A, showed a highly significant association with the control group.
Further analysis of sub-Saharan African, European, and Asian populations
showed that the protective -336A and -871G alleles were present at
higher frequencies in Eurasians than in Africans. Barreiro et al. (2006)
suggested that the longer and more intense duration of TB exposure in
Europe may have exerted stronger selective pressures in this population
and may have had an impact on susceptibility to infection by other
pathogens, such as HIV and dengue.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using a mouse model of food allergy, Zhou et al. (2010) found that mice
pretreated with bovine serum albumin (BSA) with 51 molecules of
mannoside (Man51-BSA) plus cholera toxin via oral delivery exhibited
reduced BSA-induced anaphylaxis compared with mice pretreated with BSA
plus cholera toxin. Man51-BSA selectively targeted lamina propria DCs
(LPDCs) expressing Signr1, a mouse homolog of CD209 and CLEC4M, and
induced Il10, but not Il6 (147620) or Il12 p70 (see 161560). Man51-BSA
induced the same effects in Il10-GFP knockin (tiger) mice. Interaction
of Man51-BSA with Signr1 resulted in the generation of Cd4-positive
type-1 regulatory-like (Tr1-like) cells that expressed Il10 and Ifng
(147570) in a Signr1- and Il10-dependent manner, but not
Cd4-positive/Cd25 (IL2RA; 147730)-positive/Foxp3 (300292)-positive
regulatory T cells. Tolerance could be transferred by the Tr1-like
cells. Zhou et al. (2010) proposed that sugar-modified antigens may be
useful in inducing tolerance by targeting Signr1 homologs and LPDCs.

To characterize the immunologic response associated with intravenous
immunoglobulin administration, Anthony et al. (2011) generated humanized
DCSIGN mice (hDCSIGN), and demonstrated that the antiinflammatory
activity of intravenous immunoglobulin can be recapitulated by transfer
into naive recipients of bone marrow-derived DCSIGN+ macrophages or
dendritic cells treated with IgG crystallizable fragments (Fc) that
contain glycans terminating in alpha-2,6 sialic acids (sFc).
Furthermore, sFc administration resulted in the production of IL33
(608678), which, in turn, induced expansion of IL4 (147780)-producing
basophils that promote increased expression of the inhibitory Fc
receptor Fc-gamma-RIIB (604590) on effector macrophages. Systemic
administration of the TH2 cytokines IL33 or IL4 upregulated
Fc-gamma-RIIB on macrophages and suppressed serum-induced arthritis.
Consistent with these results, transfer of IL33-treated basophils
suppressed induced arthritic inflammation. Anthony et al. (2011)
suggested that this novel DCSIGN-TH2 pathway initiated by an endogenous
ligand, sFc, provides an intrinsic mechanism for maintaining immune
homeostasis that could be manipulated to provide therapeutic benefit in
autoimmune diseases.

Martin et al. (2004) found that European Americans at risk for
parenteral HIV infection (see 609423) were more likely to carry the
-336C SNP than the -336T SNP in the promoter of DCSIGN. This association
was not observed in those at risk for mucosally acquired infection.
Although the -336C SNP was common in African Americans, no significant
association with risk of infection was observed in this group.

Sakuntabhai et al. (2005) reported strong association between the
-336A-G polymorphism in the promoter of CD209, which they called
DCSIGN1-336, and risk of dengue fever (614371). The G allele of the
variant was associated with strong protection against dengue fever in 3
independent cohorts from Thailand, with a carrier frequency of 4.7% in
individuals with dengue fever compared with 22.4% in individuals with
dengue hemorrhagic fever (odds ratio for risk of dengue hemorrhagic
fever vs dengue fever = 5.84) and 19.5% in controls (odds ratio for
protection = 4.90). This variant affects an Sp1-like binding site and
transcriptional activity in vitro. Carrington (2006) confirmed that the
-336T-C SNP reported by Martin et al. (2004) and the -336A-G SNP
reported by Sakuntabhai et al. (2005) are the same variant.

Barreiro et al. (2006) found an association between susceptibility to
tuberculosis (607948) and -336G in a South African Coloured population.

sub-Saharan Africans, but was present in 12%, 21%, and 38% of South
African Coloured, Asian, and European populations, respectively.

605643	TITLE *605643 KALLIKREIN-RELATED PEPTIDASE 5; KLK5
;;KALLIKREIN 5;;
STRATUM CORNEUM TRYPTIC ENZYME; SCTE;;
KALLIKREIN-LIKE 2; KLKL2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

KLK5 belongs to the kallikrein subgroup of serine proteases, which have
diverse physiologic functions in many tissues. For background
information on kallikreins, see 147960.

CLONING

The stratum corneum, the outermost layer of the skin, provides chemical
and mechanical resistance. The layer is derived from anucleated,
anabolically dead corneocytes that are differentiated from a subset of
proliferating keratinocytes. After a 2- to 4-week period, the cells are
shed in the process of desquamation. By zymographic analysis of
corneocyte extracts, biochemical purification, N-terminal sequencing,
database searching, and PCR of a keratinocyte library using degenerate
primers, Brattsand and Egelrud (1999) isolated a cDNA encoding KLK5,
which they termed SCTE. The deduced 293-amino acid protein contains a
signal peptide, a propeptide, and a 227-amino acid catalytically active
enzyme with 4 potential N-linked glycosylation sites and conserved
serine-protease sites. Northern blot analysis detected a 1.6-kb
transcript in a keratinocyte cell line. Western blot analysis showed
expression of proteins ranging from 25 to 37 kD in plantar stratum
corneum cells and 40 kD for the recombinant protein. After glycosidase
treatment, all samples were expressed as approximately 33-kD proteins.
RT-PCR analysis detected strong expression in skin, and after additional
amplification, expression was also detected in other tissues,
particularly brain, placenta, and kidney.

Using a positional candidate approach to identify additional KLK genes
on 19q13.3-q13.4, followed by EST database searching and PCR, Yousef and
Diamandis (1999) obtained a cDNA encoding KLK5, which they called KLKL2.
RT-PCR analysis detected expression primarily in brain, mammary gland,
and testis, with lower levels in other tissues.

By RT-PCR of 35 adult and fetal tissues, Gan et al. (2000) detected
highest KLK5 expression in adult and fetal skin. Weaker expression was
detected in mammary gland and salivary gland, and little to no
expression was detected in the other tissues examined.

GENE FUNCTION

Yousef and Diamandis (1999) found that, in the presence of estrogens and
progestins, KLK5 expression was upregulated in a breast cancer cell
line.

Kim et al. (2001) noted that KLK5 is expressed in a subset of ovarian
tumors. They found a strong positive correlation between KLK5 expression
and tumor grade and disease stage. They concluded that KLK5 expression
is associated with more aggressive forms of epithelial ovarian
carcinoma.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Yousef and Diamandis (1999) determined
that the KLK5 gene contains 5 coding exons spanning 9.3 kb. Elliott et
al. (2006) identified a 5-prime untranslated exon in the KLK5 gene.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Yousef and Diamandis (1999) mapped the
KLK5 gene to chromosome 19q13.3-q13.4. Harvey et al. (2000) mapped the
KLK5 gene to chromosome 19q13.4 in the KLK gene cluster between KLK4
(603767) and KLK6 (602652). They noted that KLK5 to KLK14 are
transcribed telomere to centromere.

;;SESQUIPEDALIAN, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, 2; SES2;;
INOSITOL POLYPHOSPHATE PHOSPHATASE-INTERACTING PROTEIN, 27-KD, B;
IPIP27B
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

FAM109A (614239) and FAM109B regulate endosomal trafficking and link
OCRL (300535) to the recycling of receptors at sorting and recycling
endosomes (Noakes et al., 2011).

CLONING

By scanning the literature, Swan et al. (2010) identified a Drosophila
protein as a candidate interactor of Ocrl. They named the Drosophila
protein Ses, short for sesquipedalian, meaning an unnecessarily long
description of a simple thing. Database analysis revealed conservation
of Ses from invertebrates to humans. In the same way that the
invertebrate Ocrl gene is duplicated in vertebrates to produce OCRL and
INPP5B (147264), the single Ses gene in invertebrates is duplicated in
vertebrates to produce FAM109A and FAM109B, which Swan et al. (2010)
called SES1 and SES2, respectively. The N-terminal portion of SES1 and
SES2 contains a pleckstrin (PLEK; 173570) homology (PH) domain followed
by a coiled-coil domain. The less conserved C-terminal portion of SES1
and SES2 is primarily unfolded and contains multiple SRC (190090)
homology-3 (SH3) domain-binding PxxP motifs. Immunofluorescence
microscopy of transfected COS-7 cells demonstrated colocalization of
human SES1 and SES2 with human OCRL in endosomes and in larger vesicles
expressing EEA1 (605070) and WDFY2 (610418).

Noakes et al. (2011) reported that the human FAM109B protein, which they
called IPIP27B, contains 259 amino acids. Immunofluorescence microscopy
of transfected human TERT-RPE1 cells demonstrated localization of
IPIP27B and IPIP27A (FAM109A) to recycling endosomes and to the
trans-Golgi network (TGN).

GENE FUNCTION

Using coimmunoprecipitation and pull-down experiments in COS-7 cells and
rat brain extracts, Swan et al. (2010) found that the C termini of human
SES1 and SES2 interacted with the ASH-RhoGAP-like domains of OCRL and
INPP5B. Mutation analysis showed that SES proteins interacted with OCRL
via a conserved C-terminal motif similar to that of another OCRL-binding
protein, APPL1 (604299). Swan et al. (2010) termed this motif the F&H
motif and found that a conserved phenylalanine was critical for OCRL
binding. Pull-down experiments in mouse brain extracts and transfected
COS-7 cells showed that missense mutations in OPRL that disrupted
binding to APPL1 in patients with Lowe syndrome (309000) or Dent
disease-2 (300555) also abolished binding of OCRL to SES1 and SES2. In
addition, APPL1 and the SES proteins could not simultaneously bind to
OCRL. Confocal microscopy suggested that APPL1 and the SES proteins
associated sequentially with endosomes and that the SES proteins
localized to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate-positive vesicles. Swan et
al. (2010) proposed that Lowe syndrome and Dent disease-2 result from
perturbations at multiples sites within the endocytic pathway.

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis, pull-down assays, and native
coimmunoprecipitation experiments in HeLa cells, Noakes et al. (2011)
confirmed that the C termini of IPIP27A and IPIP27B bound the C-terminal
ASH and RhoGAP-like domains of OCRL1 and INPP5B. IPIP27A and IPIP27B
also formed homo- and heterodimers. Similar to the results of Swan et
al. (2010), Noakes et al. (2011) found that mutations in OCRL1
associated with Lowe syndrome abolished interaction with IPIP27A and
IPIP27B. Depletion of IPIP27A and/or IPIP27B via RNA interference in
HeLa cells caused enlargement of early endosomes, disrupted recycling of
transferrin receptor (TFRC; 190010), impaired the transfer of CIMPR
(IGF2R; 147280) from endosomes to the TGN, and caused missorting of
lysosomal hydrolases. Noakes et al. (2011) proposed that IPIP27A and
IPIP27B are key players in endocytic trafficking and that defects in
this process are responsible for the pathology of Lowe syndrome and Dent
disease-2.

MAPPING

Gross (2011) mapped the FAM109B gene to chromosome 22q13.2 based on an
alignment of the FAM109B sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC104176) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

;;SCOTIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Zhang et al. (2000) cloned a cDNA encoding Scotin, which they called
HSPC217, from CD34 (142230)-positive hematopoietic stem/progenitor
cells. The deduced 170-amino acid protein contains an MYB (189990)
DNA-binding domain repeat signature. Microarray analysis of 5
hematopoietic cell lines detected low-level expression of Scotin in NB4
and Jurkat cells, but no expression was detected in HL60, K562, and U937
cells.

Bourdon et al. (2002) identified mouse Scotin by differential display of
spleen and thymus of normal and p53 (191170) null mice after gamma
irradiation of whole animals. The induced 1.85-kb transcript encodes a
deduced 235-amino acid protein. By searching an EST database using the
mouse sequence as probe, followed by 5-prime and 3-prime RACE, Bourdon
et al. (2002) cloned a full-length cDNA encoding Scotin from a placenta
cDNA library. The deduced 240-amino acid human protein shares 70%
identity with mouse Scotin. Both the human and the mouse proteins
contain an N-terminal signal sequence, a central transmembrane domain
composed of 18 hydrophobic amino acids, and a proline/tyrosine domain,
and both show an apparent molecular mass of 25 kD by Western blot
analysis. Immunolocalization of exogenously expressed Scotin revealed
colocalization with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) markers. By mutation
analysis, Bourdon et al. (2002) determined that the proline-rich domain
is required for ER localization.

GENE FUNCTION

Bourdon et al. (2002) noted that mouse thymus and spleen cells underwent
massive p53-dependent apoptosis following ultraviolet irradiation or
exposure to actinomycin D. They found that Scotin mRNA was induced
coincident with apoptosis and was expressed only in spleen and thymus of
irradiated wildtype mice and not in the spleen or thymus of irradiated
p53 null mice. Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays, they
confirmed direct binding between p53 and Scotin, and using a luciferase
reporter plasmid driven by the mouse Scotin promoter, they confirmed
dose-dependent p53 transactiviation. Furthermore, Bourdon et al. (2002)
showed that the apoptosis induced by the p53/Scotin pathway is caspase
dependent.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Bourdon et al. (2002) determined that the
human Scotin gene contains 6 exons. They identified a p53-responsive
element of 9 decamers within the mouse Scotin promoter.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Zhang et al. (2000) mapped the human
Scotin gene to chromosome 3. By genomic sequence analysis, Bourdon et
al. (2002) mapped the Scotin gene to chromosome 3p21.3. They also
identified a Scotin pseudogene on chromosome Xq13.1-q13.3.

KIAA1020
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Kikuno et al. (1999) cloned HIC2, which they designated
KIAA1020. RT-PCR ELISA revealed highest expression in cerebellum, with
intermediate levels in several other brain regions; no expression was
detected in substantia nigra. In whole tissues, expression was highest
in liver, followed by heart, brain, lung, kidney, testis, ovary, fetal
liver, and fetal brain. Little or no expression was detected in skeletal
muscle, pancreas, and spleen.

Deltour et al. (2001) extended the sequence of KIAA1020 in the 5-prime
direction by comparison with a genomic clone and by RT-PCR of a
cerebellum cDNA library. The deduced full-length HIC2 protein contains
615 amino acids. It has an N-terminal BTB/POZ domain, a conserved
GLDLSKK/R polypeptide, and 5 C-terminal Kruppel-type C2H2 fingers, 4 of
which are grouped and are separated by a typical 7- to 8-amino acid
link. HIC2 shares more than 80% homology with HIC1 (603825) through the
BTB/POZ and zinc finger domains, and both proteins have identical
GLDLSKK/R motifs.

GENE FUNCTION

By transient transfection in COS-7 cells, Deltour et al. (2001) found
that HIC2 colocalized with HIC1 onto nuclear dots. Their BTB/POZ domains
heterodimerized and repressed transcription from a reporter plasmid.
Inhibitor studies indicated that HIC1 and HIC2 do not recruit HDAC (see
601241)-containing complexes. The central GLDLSKK/R motif was found to
interact with C-terminal-binding protein (see 602618).

GENE STRUCTURE

Deltour et al. (2001) determined that the HIC2 gene contains 2 exons and
spans about 6.1 kb. The promoter region contains a putative TATA box.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Deltour et al. (2001) mapped the HIC2 gene
to chromosome 22q11.2.

608536	TITLE *608536 GTP-BINDING PROTEIN 3; GTPBP3
;;MSS1, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; MSS1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Mss1 is a yeast mitochondrial GTP-binding protein that functionally
interacts with 15S rRNA. By searching an EST database for sequences
similar to Mss1, followed by RT-PCR using hepatoma cell line total RNA
and 5-prime and 3-prime RACE, Li and Guan (2002) cloned 5 variants of
GTPBP3, an Mss1 homolog. The variants are generated by alternative
splicing and through the use of alternate polyadenylation signals. Two
variants differ only in their 3-prime UTRs and encode an identical
492-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 52.0 kD. Two
other variants encode an identical 471-amino acid protein, and another
variant encodes a 524-amino acid protein. GTPBP3 contains a typical
mitochondria targeting presequence, 2 GTP-binding domains, a p21 RAS
(see 190020)-like domain, and an SRC (190090) homology-3 (SH3) domain.
GTPBP3 shows extensive conservation of amino acid sequences with Mss1
homologs from several diverse species, including bacteria, yeast, and
nematode. Mouse and human GTPBP3 share 81% amino acid identity. Northern
blot analysis detected ubiquitous expression of 2.6- and 1.9-kb
transcripts. Expression was highest in skeletal muscle, kidney, liver,
and heart, moderate in whole brain, thymus, spleen, and small intestine,
and low in colon, lung, and leukocytes. GTPBP3 was also expressed in all
individual brain regions examined. The larger transcript was more
abundant in most tissues. GTPBP3 colocalized with a mitochondrial marker
in transfected osteosarcoma cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Yeast cells carrying mutant alleles of Mss1 coupled with a 15S rRNA
mutation that corresponds to the 1555A-G mutation of human 12S rRNA
(561000.0001) fail to synthesize subunit 1 of cytochrome oxidase (see
516030) and manifest a respiratory-deficient phenotype. Li and Guan
(2002) found that overexpression of GTPBP3 complemented the respiration
defect of yeast carrying the Mss1 and 15S rRNA mutations. They suggested
that, like yeast Mss1, GTPBP3 may influence the phenotypic expression of
the 1555A-G mutation in 12S rRNA.

GENE STRUCTURE

Li and Guan (2002) determined that the GTPBP3 gene contains 9 exons and
spans more than 6 kb. There are 2 putative polyadenylation signals.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Li and Guan (2002) mapped the GTPBP3 gene
to chromosome 19.

603486	TITLE *603486 UBIQUITIN-SPECIFIC PROTEASE 4; USP4
;;UBIQUITIN-SPECIFIC PROTEASE; UNP
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The ubiquitin-specific proteases (UBPs) are a group of deubiquitinating
enzymes that possess 2 signature motifs, the Cys box and the His box
(summary by Frederick et al., 1998).

CLONING

Gupta et al. (1993) isolated mouse cDNAs encoding Unp, a protein similar
to the human TRE oncogene. Using Western blots, Gupta et al. (1994)
found that Unp has an apparent molecular mass of 180 kD. They reported
that overexpression of Unp led to oncogenic transformation of NIH 3T3
cells injected into athymic mice.

By screening a human frontal cortex library with a murine Unp cDNA, Gray
et al. (1995) isolated cDNAs encoding human UNP. Analysis of the clones
revealed a large open reading with the potential to encode a protein of
854 amino acids, with a molecular mass of 97 kD. The human and mouse
proteins share 90% sequence identity. Northern blot analysis of primary
lung tumor samples indicated that levels of UNP mRNA were elevated in
small cell carcinomas and adenocarcinomas relative to normal adult lung.

Frederick et al. (1998) sequenced additional UNP cDNAs and found several
differences from the sequence reported by Gray et al. (1995), including
2 single nucleotide insertions that increased the length of the
predicted protein, UNPEL (UNP extended, long isoform), to 963 amino
acids. They also recovered cDNAs encoding a shorter isoform designated
UNPES. Both isoforms exhibited deubiquitinating activity. Antibodies
against UNP detected 2 proteins of 105 to 110 kD on Western blots. Using
immunocytochemistry of mammalian cells expressing epitope-tagged UNP and
cell fractionation studies, Frederick et al. (1998) demonstrated that
both isoforms of the human protein are localized primarily in the
cytosol. (In an erratum, Frederick et al. (1998) cited a personal
communication from the Gray laboratory stating that the data in Gupta et
al. (1993) locating Unp in the nuclear fraction of mammalian cell
extracts was apparently in error.) Northern blot analysis revealed UNP
expression as a closely-migrating cluster of mRNAs in all tissues
tested. However, the authors found no evidence for overexpression of UNP
transcripts in cell lines derived from small cell lung carcinomas.

GENE STRUCTURE

Di Fruscio et al. (1998) reported that the mouse Unp gene contains 22
exons distributed over 47 kb. A processed ribosomal S2 pseudogene was
identified in the third intron.

MAPPING

By analysis of an interspecific backcross, Gupta et al. (1993) mapped
the Unp gene to mouse chromosome 9 in a region showing homology of
synteny with human chromosome 3p.

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Gray et al. (1995) mapped the
human UNP gene to 3p21.3, a region implicated in neoplasms of the lung.
Using the same technique, Frederick et al. (1998) refined the map
position to 3p21.31.

603926	TITLE *603926 SYNAPTOGYRIN 2; SYNGR2
;;CELLUGYRIN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Synaptic vesicles represent specialized secretory organelles that store
neurotransmitters in nerve terminals, and release them by fusing with
the presynaptic plasma membrane during exocytosis. Synaptogyrin (SYNGR1;
603925) and synaptophysins I (see 313475) and II (synaptoporin) contain
4 transmembrane regions with cytoplasmic C and N termini, and are among
the most abundant synaptic vesicle proteins.

CLONING

Janz and Sudhof (1998) identified a rat gene encoding cellugyrin, a
protein related to synaptogyrin. Western blot analysis revealed that
cellugyrin and synaptogyrin are expressed in mirror-image patterns in
rat tissues: cellugyrin is ubiquitous with the lowest levels in brain,
while synaptogyrin is detectable only in the brain. Subcellular
fractionation of rat brain cells indicated that both synaptogyrin and
cellugyrin are associated with microsomes; however, only synaptogyrin is
found in synaptic vesicles. The authors suggested that synaptogyrin is a
specialized version of the ubiquitous cellugyrin, supporting the concept
that synaptic vesicles are a simplified and specialized form of a
generic trafficking organelle. Independently, Kedra et al. (1998)
identified cDNAs encoding the mouse and human homologs of cellugyrin,
which they called synaptogyrin- 2 (SYNGR2). Like SYNGR1, the predicted
224-amino acid human SYNGR2 protein contains 4 transmembrane regions.
Northern blot analysis revealed that the 1.6-kb SYNGR2 mRNA was
expressed at high levels in all tissues tested except brain.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization and by analysis of mapped clones,
Kedra et al. (1998) mapped the SYNGR2 gene to 17qtel and an SYNGR2
pseudogene to 15q11.

;;NUMB-RELATED GENE; NUMBR;;
NUMBLIKE; NBL;;
TRINUCLEOTIDE REPEAT-CONTAINING GENE 23; TNRC23
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The Drosophila 'numb' (603728) gene encodes a membrane-associated
protein that is predominantly segregated to only 1 of the daughter cells
of dividing neural precursors after division, allowing the 2 daughter
cells to adopt distinct fates. Studies with mouse Numb in dividing
ventricular cells during cortical neurogenesis suggested that Numb
suppresses Notch1 (190198) activity in the daughter cell, allowing it to
remain as a progenitor while the other daughter cell migrates to the
cortical plate and terminally differentiates into a neuron (Zhong et
al., 1996). Zhong et al. (1997) cloned a mouse cDNA encoding a
Numb-related protein, which they designated Numblike (Nbl). In mouse,
the Nbl gene was preferentially expressed in adult and embryonic nervous
system. In the developing neocortex, Nbl was expressed in postmitotic
neurons in the cortical plate, but not in progenitor cells within the
ventricular zone. When expressed in Drosophila, the Nbl protein was
symmetrically distributed in the cytoplasm. In Drosophila numb mutant
embryos, expression of Nbl allowed both daughter cells of a neural
precursor to adopt the fate of the cell that normally inherits the numb
gene. Zhong et al. (1997) suggested a model of cortical neurogenesis in
which a daughter cell that does not inherit the Numb gene exhibits a
relatively higher Notch1 activity and, as a result, is not a progenitor
and does not become a fully differentiated neuron until it reaches the
cortical plate. Once there, newly accumulated Numb and Nbl suppress the
residual Notch1 activity and allow the cell to fully differentiate into
a neuron.

The EPS15 (600051) and mouse Eps15R proteins contain 3 copies of the EH
protein-protein interaction domain. Salcini et al. (1997) determined
that EH domains from EPS15 and Eps15R bind in vitro to peptides
containing an asn-pro-phe (NPF) motif. By screening a human fibroblast
expression library with a chimeric glutathione S-transferase-EH-domain
protein, the authors identified cDNAs encoding NUMB, NUMBR, RAB
(600862), RABR (604019), and 3 other proteins that interact with EH
domains. The predicted 609-amino acid NUMBR protein shares 57% identity
with NUMB. Both NUMB and NUMBR contain a phosphotyrosine interaction
domain in the N terminus, putative SH3-binding sites in the C terminus,
and a single NPF motif near the C terminus.

GENE FUNCTION

Expansions of trinucleotide repeats are associated with several human
diseases, most with neuropsychiatric features. Margolis et al. (1997)
identified CTG3a, a NUMBL cDNA, as one of a group of brain cDNAs
containing CAG repeats.

MAPPING

By linkage, Margolis et al. (1997) mapped the NUMBL gene to
19q13.13-q13.2.

ANIMAL MODEL

Petersen et al. (2002) generated Nbl homozygous mutant mice, which were
viable and fertile, and exhibited no obvious phenotypes. Mice with
knockouts of both Nbl and Numb died around embryonic day 9.5 (E9.5) with
more widespread defects than single mutants. Mouse Numb conditional
knockouts with heterozygous Nbl background were viable and exhibited no
gross morphologic or behavioral defects. In double knockout mice, early
neurons emerge in expected spatial and temporal patterns but at the
expense of progenitor cells, leading to a nearly complete depletion of
dividing cells shortly after the onset of neurogenesis. Petersen et al.
(2002) concluded that a shared molecular mechanism with mouse Numb and
Nbl as key components governs the self-renewal of all neural progenitor
cells regardless of their lineage or regional identities.

Li et al. (2003) created mice with restricted inactivation of Numb in
the dorsal forebrain of Numbl-null mice beginning at E9.5. Double
mutants were viable but showed behavioral abnormalities and severe
cortical dysplasia in the adult brain. Examination of progenitor
proliferation and neuronal differentiation during later peak phase of
neurogenesis (E12.5 to E16.5) showed that loss of Numb and Numbl in
dorsal forebrain resulted in neural progenitor hyperproliferation,
delayed cell cycle exit, impaired neuronal differentiation, and
concomitant defects in cortical morphogenesis.

Neurogenesis in the mouse occurs between E11 and E17. In Numb and Numbl
double knockout mice with conditional ablation of both genes at E10.5,
Petersen et al. (2004) found thinning of the neocortex and hippocampus
as well as a significant loss of progenitor cells by E16.5. Before
neurogenesis, double knockout mouse progenitor cells were able to
proliferate, suggesting that Numb and Numbl do not play a significant
role very early on. Petersen et al. (2004) concluded that neural
progenitor cells have a continuing requirement for Numb and Numbl during
neurogenesis to maintain progenitor cells, not to promote neuronal cell
fates.

Huang et al. (2005) conditionally deleted Numb and Numbl in mouse
sensory neurons. The deletions had no effect on generation and
differentiation of sensory neurons, but afferent fibers showed severely
reduced axonal arborization. Loss of Numb and Numbl reduced endocytosis
and led to a modest increase in nuclear Notch1. Conversely,
overexpression of Numb, but not mutant Numb lacking alpha-adaptin
(601026)-interacting domain, led to accumulation of Notch1 in abnormal
endocytic/lysosomal vesicles, reduced nuclear Notch, and dramatically
increased axonal length and branch points. Huang et al. (2005) concluded
that NUMB and NUMBL function in sensory axon arborization by regulating
NOTCH1 via endocytic lysosomal pathways.

601788	TITLE *601788 MYOSTATIN; MSTN
;;GROWTH/DIFFERENTIATION FACTOR 8; GDF8
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The transforming growth factor-beta superfamily encompasses a large
number of growth and differentiation factors that play important roles
in regulating embryonic development and in maintaining tissue
homeostasis in adult animals. Myostatin, or GDF8, is a member of this
superfamily with a role in the control and maintenance of skeletal
muscle mass.

CLONING

Using degenerate PCR, McPherron et al. (1997) identified a novel mouse
TGF-beta family member, designated growth/differentiation factor-8,
which is expressed specifically in developing and adult skeletal muscle.
The gene encodes a 376-amino acid polypeptide that contains all the
sequence hallmarks of the TGF-beta superfamily (190180). During early
stages of embryogenesis, Gdf8 expression is restricted to the myotome
compartment of developing somites. At later stages and in adult animals,
Gdf8 is expressed in many different muscles throughout the body.

Gonzalez-Cadavid et al. (1998) cloned the human myostatin gene and cDNA.
MSTN is transcribed as a 3.1-kb mRNA species that encodes a 335-amino
acid precursor protein. Myostatin is expressed uniquely in human
skeletal muscle as a 26-kD mature glycoprotein (myostatin-immunoreactive
protein) and secreted into the plasma. Myostatin immunoreactivity is
detectable in human skeletal muscle in both type 1 and type 2 fibers.

GENE FUNCTION

Gonzalez-Cadavid et al. (1998) examined the hypothesis that myostatin
expression correlates inversely with fat-free mass in humans and that
increased expression of the myostatin gene is associated with weight
loss in men with AIDS wasting syndrome. They examined the expression of
myostatin in skeletal muscle and serum of healthy and HIV-infected men.
The serum and intramuscular concentrations of myostatin-immunoreactive
protein were increased in HIV-infected men with weight loss compared
with healthy men and correlated inversely with fat-free mass index.

Zimmers et al. (2002) demonstrated that myostatin is synthesized as a
preprotein activated by 2 proteolytic cleavages. Removal of the signal
sequence is followed by cleavage at a tetrabasic processing site,
resulting in a 26-kD amino-terminal propeptide and a 12.5-kD
carboxy-terminal peptide, a dimer of which is the biologically active
portion of the protein. Zimmers et al. (2002) demonstrated that
myostatin circulates in the blood of adult mice in a latent form that
can be activated by acid treatment, similar to TGF-beta. Systemic
overexpression of myostatin in adult mice was found to induce profound
muscle and fat loss without diminution of nutrient intake. This is
similar to that seen in human cachexia syndromes, and suggests that
myostatin may be a useful pharmacologic target in clinical settings such
as cachexia, where muscle growth is desired.

GENE STRUCTURE

Gonzalez-Cadavid et al. (1998) determined that the MSTN gene contains 3
exons and has 3 putative transcription initiation sites.

MAPPING

The Mh locus in cattle is located in the same region as the COL3A1 gene
(120180), which maps to bovine 2q12-q22. This identified the region
flanking COL3A1 on the human map, namely 2q31-q33, as the likely
orthologous human chromosome segment containing the MSTN gene
(Solinas-Toldo et al., 1995).

Hartz (2004) mapped the GDF8 gene to chromosome 2q32.2 based on an
alignment of the GDF8 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF019627) with the
genomic sequence.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Ferrell et al. (1999) determined the nucleotide sequence of human
myostatin in 40 individuals. The invariant promoter contains a consensus
myogenic differentiation antigen-1 (MYOD; 159970) binding site, and the
coding sequence contains 5 missense substitutions in conserved amino
acid residues: A55T, K153R, E164K, P198A, and I225T. A55T in exon 1 and
K153R in exon 2 were polymorphic in the general population, with
significantly different allele frequencies in Caucasians and African
Americans (P less than 0.001). Neither of the common polymorphisms had a
significant impact on muscle mass response to strength training in
either Caucasians or African Americans, although skewed allele
frequencies precluded detection of small effects. Ferrell et al. (1999)
concluded that these allelic variants provide markers for examining
association between the myostatin gene and interindividual variation in
muscle mass and differences in loss of muscle mass with aging.

Myostatin is a negative regulator of muscle growth in mammals, and
loss-of-function mutations are associated with increased skeletal muscle
mass in mice, cattle, and humans. Saunders et al. (2006) showed that
positive natural selection has acted on human nucleotide variation at
GDF8, since the observed ratio of nonsynonymous:synonymous changes among
humans is significantly greater than expected under the neutral model
and is strikingly different from patterns observed across mammalian
orders. Furthermore, extended haplotypes around GDF8 suggest that 2
amino acid variants have been subject to recent positive selection. Both
mutations are rare among non-Africans yet are at frequencies of up to
31% in sub-Saharan Africans. These signatures of selection at the
molecular level suggest that human variation at GDF8 is associated with
functional differences. The 2 nucleotide polymorphisms of primary
interest were G163A and A2246G, corresponding to haplogroups 55 and 153,
respectively. The frequency of these among African Americans was found
to be 12% and 20%, respectively, but only 1% and 4%, respectively, in
the Europeans sampled. The excess of nonsynonymous polymorphism had been
previously seen only for a few other genes in humans, e.g., G6PD
(305900) and the major histocompatibility complex (142800) (Verrelli et
al., 2002; Hughes and Nei, 1989).

In a healthy child with muscle hypertrophy and unusual strength (MSLHP;
614160), Schuelke et al. (2004) identified homozygosity for a splice
donor site mutation in the MSTN gene (601788.0001). His mother, a former
professional athlete, was heterozygous for the mutation.

Prontera et al. (2010) reported a 42-year old Italian man with a complex
phenotype of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS; 130000) caused by a 13.7-Mb de
novo heterozygous deletion of chromosome 2q23.3-q31.2 resulting in
deletion of the COL3A1 (120180), COL5A2 (120190), and myostatin genes.
Loss-of-function mutations in COL3A1 and COL5A2 cause EDS types IV
(130050) and I, respectively. Haploinsufficiency for MSTN results in
overgrowth of skeletal muscle. Due to the monosomy for MSTN, the patient
had 'an exceptional constitutional muscular mass,' without muscle
weakness, myalgia, or easy fatigability. He also had no generalized
joint hypomobility or recurrent joint dislocation; symptoms of EDS were
limited to recurrent inguinal hernias and mild mitral valve prolapse.
Prontera et al. (2010) hypothesized that haploinsufficiency for the MSTN
allele exerted a protective effect again EDS clinical manifestations in
this patient. The findings also indicated that there is direct
involvement of muscle damage in EDS and that care of muscle function in
these patients may be beneficial.

ANIMAL MODEL

To determine the biologic function of Gdf8, McPherron et al. (1997)
disrupted the Gdf8 gene by gene targeting in mice. Gdf8-null animals
were significantly larger than wildtype animals and showed a large and
widespread increase in skeletal muscle mass. Individual muscles of
mutant animals weighed 2 to 3 times more than those of wildtype animals,
and the increase in mass appeared to result from a combination of muscle
cell hyperplasia and hypertrophy. McPherron et al. (1997) suggested that
Gdf8 functions specifically as a negative regulator of skeletal muscle
growth. Lin et al. (2002) observed increased skeletal muscle mass in
their myostatin-null mouse model compared to wildtype animals as early
as 4 weeks of age. In addition, the mutant mice showed reduced
production and secretion of leptin (164160) which was associated with
reduced fat deposition. The reduced adipogenesis in the knockout mice
suggested that myostatin is involved in regulating adiposity as well as
muscularity.

Several cattle breeds have been observed to show an exceptional muscle
development commonly referred to as 'double-muscled.' Double-muscled
animals are characterized by an increase in muscle mass of about 20%,
due to general skeletal muscle hyperplasia, i.e., an increase in the
number of muscle fibers rather than in their individual diameter. Grobet
et al. (1997) stated that autosomal recessive inheritance had been
suggested by segregation analysis performed both in experimental crosses
and in the outbred population. This was confirmed by Charlier et al.
(1995) who showed that the muscular hypertrophy (mh) locus maps to the
centromeric end of bovine chromosome 2. Grobet et al. (1997) used a
positional candidate approach to demonstrate that a mutation in the
bovine MSTN gene (Mh locus), which encodes myostatin, is responsible for
the double-muscled phenotype. They found an 11-bp deletion in the coding
sequence for the bioactive C-terminal domain of the protein causing the
muscular hypertrophy.

In the Marchigiana breed of beef cattle in central Italy, Marchitelli et
al. (2003) demonstrated that double muscling was associated with a
G-to-T transversion in the third exon of the myostatin gene, introducing
a premature stop codon. This added to the large series of mutations
previously found in cattle with double muscling.

An autosomal recessive hypermuscular mouse mutation termed 'compact'
(Cmpt) was shown by Szabo et al. (1998) to be caused by deletion in the
myostatin gene. Myostatin became a strong candidate gene for Cmpt when
it was mapped to chromosome 1 in a region of homology to human 2q32-q35
and to the centromeric region of bovine chromosome 2 where the mh gene
maps.

McPherron and Lee (2002) showed that myostatin-null mice have a
significant reduction in fat accumulation with increasing age as
compared to wildtype littermates and that loss of myostatin partially
attenuates the obese and diabetic phenotypes of 2 mouse models, the
agouti lethal yellow and obese mice. McPherron and Lee (2002) suggested
that pharmacologic agents that block myostatin function may be useful
not only for enhancing muscle growth, but also for slowing or preventing
the development of obesity and type II diabetes.

Bogdanovich et al. (2002) tested the ability of inhibition of myostatin
in vivo to ameliorate the dystrophic phenotype in the mdx mouse model of
Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD; 310200). They blocked endogenous
myostatin in mdx mice by intraperitoneal injections of blocking
antibodies for 3 months and found increase in body weight, muscle mass,
muscle size, and absolute muscle strength along with a significant
decrease in muscle degeneration and concentrations of serum creatine
kinase. Bogdanovich et al. (2002) concluded that myostatin blockade
provides a novel, pharmacologic strategy for treatment of diseases
associated with muscle wasting such as DMD, and circumvents the major
problems associated with conventional gene therapy in these disorders.

In myostatin-null mice (Mstn -/-) crossed with mdx mice, a model for
Duchenne and Becker (300376) muscular dystrophy, Wagner et al. (2002)
found increased muscle mass, increased body weight, increased muscle
fiber size, and increased strength compared to Mstn +/+/mdx mice. There
was also a reduction in the extent of muscle fibrosis. They noted that
although the loss of myostatin does not correct the primary defect in
the mdx mice, it may ameliorate some features of the dystrophic
phenotype.

Texel sheep are renowned for their exceptional meatiness. To identify
the genes underlying this economically important feature, Clop et al.
(2006) performed a full-genome scan in a Romanov x Texel F2 population.
They mapped a quantitative trait locus with a major effect on muscle
mass to chromosome 2 and subsequently fine-mapped it to a chromosome
interval encompassing the GDF8 gene. They demonstrated that the GDF8
allele of Texel sheep is characterized by a G-to-A transition in the
3-prime untranslated region (UTR) that creates a target site for mir1
(609326) and mir206, microRNAs (miRNAs) that are highly expressed in
skeletal muscle. The mutation causes translational inhibition of the
myostatin gene and hence contributes to the muscular hypertrophy of
Texel sheep. Analysis of SNP databases for humans and mice demonstrated
that mutations creating or destroying putative miRNA target sites are
abundant and might be important effectors of phenotypic variation.

In COS-7 cells, Ohsawa et al. (2006) found that myostatin signaling was
inhibited by caveolin-3 (CAV3; 601253), which directly interacted with
and inhibited type I myostatin receptors ALK4 (601300) and ALK5
(190181). Transgenic mice with Cav3 deficiency, a model for limb girdle
muscular dystrophy type 1C (LGMD1C; 607801), show muscle atrophy and
weakness. Ohsawa et al. (2006) found that doubly transgenic mice with
both Cav3 deficiency and myostatin inhibition showed increased numbers
and size of myofibers compared to singly Cav3-deficient mice,
effectively reversing the muscle atrophy induced by Cav3 deficiency. In
addition, intraperitoneal injection of a myostatin inhibitor improved
functional muscle weakness in Cav3-deficient mice. Ohsawa et al. (2006)
suggested that caveolin-3 normally suppresses myostatin signaling and
that hyperactivation of myostatin signaling participates in the
pathogenesis of muscular atrophy in this mouse model of LGMD1C.

Mosher et al. (2007) found that a 2-bp deletion in exon 3 of the canine
Mstn gene was associated with increased muscle mass in the whippet
racing dog breed. Homozygosity for the mutation was associated with a
grossly overmuscled double-muscled phenotype, commonly referred to as
the 'bully.' Heterozygous dogs showed an intermediate phenotype and have
been reported to be among the fastest dogs in competitive racing events.
Analysis of several other dogs breeds, including greyhounds, did not
identify the mutation.

Mendias et al. (2008) found that tendons of Mstn-null mice were smaller
than those of wildtype mice. Mstn-null tendons had decreased fibroblast
density, decreased expression of type I collagen (see COL1A1; 120150),
and decreased expression of scleraxis (SCXA; 609067) and tenomodulin
(TNMD; 300459), 2 genes that promote tendon fibroblast proliferation.
Treatment of wildtype tendon fibroblasts with Mstn activated p38 MAP
kinase (MAPK14; 600289) and Smad2 (601366)/Smad3 (603109) signaling
cascades, increased cell proliferation, and increased expression of type
I collagen, Scxa, and Tnmd. Compared with tendons from wildtype mice,
the mechanical properties of tibialis anterior tendons from Mstn-null
mice had a greater peak stress, lower peak strain, and increased
stiffness. Mendias et al. (2008) concluded that, in addition to
regulating muscle mass and force, MSTN regulates the structure and
function of tendon tissues.

Hill et al. (2010) identified a SNP in the equine myostatin gene that
was strongly associated with sprinting ability and stamina in
thoroughbred racehorses.

In a child with muscle hypertrophy and unusual strength (614160),
Schuelke et al. (2004) identified homozygosity for a g.IVS1+5G-A
transition at the splice donor site of intron 1, causing a cryptic
splice site to occur 108 bp downstream and giving rise to a severely
truncated protein. His mother, a former professional athlete, was
heterozygous for the mutation, which was not found in 200 control
chromosomes. Other family members were said to be exceptionally strong,
but were were not available for study.

603079	TITLE *603079 CHROMOBOX HOMOLOG 4, DROSOPHILA POLYCOMB CLASS; CBX4
;;POLYCOMB, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, 2; PC2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

'Polycomb' (Pc) and other members of the Drosophila Polycomb group gene
family are part of a cellular memory system that is responsible for the
inheritance of gene activity by progeny cells. Pc shares a homologous
domain known as the chromodomain with the Drosophila
heterochromatin-binding protein, HP1. To isolate human Pc homologs,
Satijn et al. (1997) screened a fetal brain cDNA library with a probe
containing the nonchromodomain portion of a Xenopus Pc homolog (XPc).
They recovered a cDNA encoding a predicted 558-amino acid protein that
they designated human Pc2. Human Pc2 and XPc share 48% protein sequence
identity. Northern blot analysis revealed that human Pc2 is expressed as
a 2.8-kb transcript in all tissues tested with almost equal abundance.
Using immunofluorescence, Satijn et al. (1997) found that human Pc2
colocalizes with another human Pc homolog, CBX2 (602770), in interphase
nuclei, suggesting that the proteins are part of a complex.

GENE FUNCTION

Based on the results of studies with mutant proteins and overexpression
of wildtype protein, Satijn et al. (1997) suggested that human Pc2 is a
repressor of protooncogene activity and that interference with human Pc2
function can lead to derepression of protooncogene transcription and
subsequently to cellular transformation.

Pc2 recruits the transcriptional corepressor CTBP (602618) to Polycomb
group (PcG) bodies. Kagey et al. (2003) showed that CTBP is sumoylated
at a single lysine. In vitro, CTBP sumoylation minimally required the
SUMO E1 and E2 (UBC9; 601661) and SUMO1 (601912). However, Pc2
dramatically enhanced CTBP sumoylation. The authors proposed that, in
vivo, this is likely due to the ability of Pc2 to recruit both CTBP and
UBC9 to PcG bodies, thereby bringing together substrate and E2 and
stimulating the transfer of SUMO to CTBP. These results demonstrated
that Pc2 is a SUMO E3 and suggested that PcG bodies may be sumoylation
centers.

610222	TITLE *610222 RAS AND RAB INTERACTOR 2; RIN2
;;RAB5-INTERACTING PROTEIN 2;;
RAS INHIBITOR JC265
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

RIN2 is a member of the RIN family of Ras interaction-interference
proteins, which are binding partners to the RAB5 small GTPases (see
RAB5A, 179512) (Saito et al., 2002).

CLONING

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis with GTPase-deficient mutant RAB5B
(179514) as bait, followed by database analysis and 5-prime RACE of a
human brain cDNA library, Saito et al. (2002) cloned the RIN2 gene. The
deduced 895-amino acid protein contains an SH2 domain, 2 proline-rich
domains, a RIN homology (RH) domain, a Vps9 domain, and a Ras
association domain, and has a molecular mass of 116 kD. Northern blot
analysis detected a 5.1-kb transcript in most tissues examined, with
highest expression in heart and kidney, and lowest expression in spleen
and peripheral blood cells. RIN2 mRNA expression was detected in HeLa
and astrocytoma cell lines, but not in the Jurkat or THP1 leukemic cell
lines. Using gel filtration analysis and coimmunoprecipitation of
Myc-tagged RIN2 deletion mutants, Saito et al. (2002) showed that RIN2
self-interacts as a homophilic tetramer that is formed by antiparallel
linkage of 2 parallel dimers.

GENE FUNCTION

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Saito et al. (2002) showed that RIN2
interacted with both wildtype RAB5B and a constitutively active form of
RAB5B, but displayed weak interaction with a dominant-negative form of
RAB5B. RIN2 did not interact with wildtype HRAS (190020) or with an
active form of HRAS. RIN2 amino acids 497-784, which contain the RH and
Vps9 domains, were required for RAB5B binding. By in vitro binding
analysis of purified recombinant FLAG-tagged RIN2 and prenylated Rab5b,
Saito et al. (2002) demonstrated that RIN2 bound GTP preferentially over
GDP and accelerated GDP-GTP exchange on RAB5B. RIN2-GTP binding was slow
at physiologic concentrations of Mg(2+), and RIN2 enhancement of GDP-GTP
exchange achieved maximal levels during the first 5 minutes. Saito et
al. (2002) concluded that RIN2 acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange
factor.

Basel-Vanagaite et al. (2009) downregulated the expression of RIN2 in
normal fibroblasts by siRNA and observed the appearance of numerous
Golgi-associated vacuoles in RIN2-deficient fibroblasts. They also
showed that RIN2 deficiency was associated with paucity of dermal
microfibrils and deficiency of fibulin-5.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the RIN2
gene to chromosome 20 (TMAP RH68568).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 3 affected members of 2 related consanguineous Israeli-Arab families
with MACS syndrome (613075), Basel-Vanagaite et al. (2009) identified
homozygosity for a mutation in the RIN2 gene (610222.0001). RIN2 protein
was absent from fibroblasts from the patients, indicating a
loss-of-function effect.

In 3 Algerian sibs from a consanguineous family with MACS syndrome,
previously described by Verloes et al. (2005), Syx et al. (2010)
identified a homozygous 2-bp deletion in the RIN2 gene (610222.0002).
Ultrastructural studies of the skin revealed important abnormalities in
the collagen fibril morphology, and fibroblasts exhibited a dilated
endoplasmic reticulum and an abnormal Golgi apparatus with rarefied and
dilated cisternae.

In 3 affected members of 2 related consanguineous Israeli-Arab families
with MACS syndrome (613075), Basel-Vanagaite et al. (2009) identified
homozygosity for a 1-bp deletion (1731delC) in the RIN2 gene, resulting
in a frameshift (Ile578SerfsX4). The mutation resulted in markedly
decreased RIN2 mRNA levels in RNA derived from patient skin biopsies,
suggesting that the mutation induces nonsense-mRNA decay. Immunoblotting
of protein extracts from patient-derived fibroblasts revealed absence of
the RIN2 protein. These data suggested that the mutation results in loss
of function of RIN2. The mutation was not found in 182 ethnically
matched control individuals.

In 3 affected Algerian sibs from a consanguineous family segregating an
autosomal recessive genodermatosis (613075), Syx et al. (2010)
identified a homozygous 2-bp deletion in exon 8 of the RIN2 gene
(1914_1915delGC). The variant introduces a frameshift and creates a
premature termination codon, leading to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay.
The mutation was not found in 94 control individuals. The sibs, who were
originally described by Verloes et al. (2005), had progressive facial
coarsening, gingival hypertrophy, severe scoliosis, sparse hair, and
skin and joint hyperlaxity.

607082	TITLE *607082 CALCIUM CHANNEL, VOLTAGE-DEPENDENT, ALPHA-2/DELTA SUBUNIT 2; CACNA2D2
;;KIAA0558
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The CACNA2D2 gene encodes the alpha-2-delta-2 auxiliary subunit of high
voltage-gated calcium channels. Auxiliary subunits modulate calcium
current and channel activation and inactivation kinetics, and may be
involved in proper assembly and membrane localization of the channels.
Alpha-2-delta-2 is a receptor for the antiepileptic drug gabapentin
(summary by Edvardson et al., 2013).

CLONING

By searching for sequences with the potential to encode large proteins
expressed in brain, Nagase et al. (1998) identified a cDNA encoding
CACNA2D2, which they called KIAA0558. The deduced 1,145-amino acid
protein was predicted to be 45% identical to mouse Cacna2d2. RT-PCR
analysis detected ubiquitous expression.

Using a positional cloning strategy to identify a putative tumor
suppressor gene on chromosome 3p21.3, Gao et al. (2000) obtained a cDNA
encoding CACNA2D2. The CACNA2D2 protein is 56% identical to CACNA2D1
(114204), and 17 of 22 cysteines in CACNA2D2 are conserved in CACNA2S1,
suggesting similar secondary structures. CACNA2D2 also has multiple
putative N-glycosylation sites. Northern blot analysis revealed
expression of a 5.5-kb transcript that was most abundant in lung and
testis, followed by brain, heart, and pancreas, with low levels in
prostate and skeletal muscle. Some lung cancer lines expressed CACNA2D2.
Western blot analysis showed expression of a 150-kD protein, larger than
the predicted 130 kD, presumably due to glycosylation. Functional
analysis indicated that CACNA2D2 is able to act as an auxiliary subunit
of all 3 subfamilies of voltage-gated calcium channels.

By physical cloning methodologies and bioinformatic computational
analyses, Lerman and Minna (2000) identified a number of genes,
including CACNA2D2, in a region of chromosome 3p21.3 that is associated
with a putative lung cancer tumor suppressor gene. They did not detect
CACNA2D2 mutations in any lung cancer cell lines tested.

Each alpha-2-delta subunit is encoded by a single gene and
post-translationally cleaved into a long, N-terminal, extracellular
alpha-2 protein and a shorter, membrane-anchored delta polypeptide; the
alpha-2 and delta proteins are covalently linked by disulfide bonds
(summary by Brill et al., 2004).

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Lerman and Minna (2000) determined that
the CACNA2D2 gene contains at least 40 exons and spans approximately 140
kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the CACNA2D2
gene to chromosome 3. By genomic sequence analysis, Gao et al. (2000)
refined the localization to 3p21.3, a site of frequent deletions in
breast and lung cancers.

GENE FUNCTION

Hoppa et al. (2012) showed that a trafficking step probably sets
synaptic voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) levels in rats, because
overexpression of the pore-forming alpha-1A VGCC subunit (CACNA1A;
601011) fails to change synaptic VGCC abundance or function.
Alpha-2-deltas are a family of glycosylphosphatidylinositol
(GPI)-anchored VGCC-associated subunits that, in addition to being the
target of the potent neuropathic analgesics gabapentin and pregabalin
(alpha-2-delta-1 (CACNA2D1) and alpha-2-delta-2 (CACNA2D2)), were also
identified in a forward genetic screen for pain genes (alpha-2-delta-3
(CACNA2D3; 606399)). Hoppa et al. (2012) showed that these proteins
confer powerful modulation of presynaptic function through 2 distinct
molecular mechanisms. First, alpha-2-delta subunits set synaptic VGCC
abundance, as predicted from their chaperone-like function when
expressed in nonneuronal cells. Second, alpha-2-deltas configure
synaptic VGCCs to drive exocytosis through an extracellular metal
ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS), a conserved set of amino acids
within the predicted von Willebrand A domain of alpha-2-delta.
Expression of alpha-2-delta with an intact MIDAS motif leads to an 80%
increase in release probability, while simultaneously protecting
exocytosis from blockade by an intracellular calcium chelator.
Alpha-2-deltas harboring MIDAS site mutations still drive synaptic
accumulation of VGCCs; however, they no longer change release
probability or sensitivity to intracellular calcium chelators. Hoppa et
al. (2012) concluded that their data reveal dual functionality of these
clinically important VGCC subunits, allowing synapses to make more
efficient use of calcium entry to drive neurotransmitter release.

ANIMAL MODEL

Brodbeck et al. (2002) showed that mice with the 'ducky' (du) mutation,
a model for absence epilepsy (see 600131), had a mutation in Cacna2d2
gene. The mutation resulted in the introduction of a premature stop
codon and the expression of a truncated protein encoded by the first 3
exons of Cacna2d2, followed by 8 novel amino acids. The shortened mRNA
and protein were expressed in mutant mouse cerebellum and Purkinje
cells. Brodbeck et al. (2002) detected high expression of the normal
protein in cerebellar Purkinje cells, but found that ducky mice had
abnormalities in their Purkinje cell dendritic trees. Functional
analysis indicated that the mutant Cacna2d2 protein failed to increase
or even decreased the peak current density of the voltage-gated Ca(V)2.1
(CACNA1A; 601011)/beta-4 (CACNB4; 601949) channel combination,
suggesting that it may contribute to the ducky phenotype.

Brill et al. (2004) identified a recessive mouse phenotype, 'entla,'
caused by an in-frame duplication of 39 amino acids in the Cacna2d2
gene, resulting in expression of a full-length, membrane-associated
protein, but with loss of the disulfide linkage between the 2 derived
proteins. Mutant mice developed ataxia by postnatal day 13 to 15
followed by paroxysmal dyskinesia. The mice showed reduced size and
weight, increased mortality before weaning, and female infertility. EEG
studies suggested absence epilepsy, with 2- and 4-Hz spike-wave
discharges in the cortex and hippocampus. Cerebellar Purkinje cells
isolated from mutant mice showed about a 50% reduction in current, as
well as a reduction of gabapentin binding to the membrane compared to
wildtype and to heterozygous mice. Entla (ent) mice showed no
neuroanatomical abnormalities.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
VARIANT OF UNKNOWN SIGNIFICANCE
CACNA2D2, LEU1040PRO

This variant is classified as a variant of unknown significance because
its contribution to early infantile epileptic encephalopathy has not
been confirmed.

In 3 sibs, born of consanguineous Arab-Palestinian parents, with early
infantile epileptic encephalopathy, global developmental delay, and
cerebellar atrophy, Edvardson et al. (2013) identified a homozygous
3119A-G transition in the CACNA2D2 gene, resulting in a leu1040-to-pro
(L1040P) substitution at a highly conserved residue. The variant, which
was identified by linkage analysis combined with whole-exome sequencing,
was not found in 102 controls or in 6,503 control exomes. In vitro
expression studies in Xenopus oocytes showed that the variant protein
decreased currents of N- and L-type calcium channels and caused slower
inactivation in N-type channels. Although the variant protein was
expressed, it showed decreased localization to the plasma membrane
compared to wildtype, suggesting that it may not properly associate with
the alpha-1 subunit. Edvardson et al. (2013) postulated that prolonged
channel opening and calcium influx during depolarization associated with
delayed inactivation may underlie the epileptic phenotype observed in
these patients. There was no evidence for a dominant-negative effect.
Exome sequencing in 1 of the 3 affected sibs also identified a
homozygous C-to-T transition in the CELSR3 gene (604264), resulting in a
met2630-to-ile (M2630I; 604264.0001) substitution at a highly conserved
residue. This variant also segregated with the disease state in the
family. Inactivation of Celsr3 in mice causes abnormalities in
connectivity in the cerebral cortex (Zhou et al., 2008). Edvardson et
al. (2013) could not exclude a role for the CELSR3 mutation in the
epileptic phenotype in this family.

612384	TITLE *612384 MEDIATOR COMPLEX SUBUNIT 18; MED18
;;TRAP/MEDIATOR COMPLEX SUBUNIT p28b; P28B
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MED18 is a component of the Mediator complex, which is a coactivator for
DNA-binding factors that activate transcription via RNA polymerase II
(Sato et al., 2003).

CLONING

Using HeLa cells overexpressing epitope-tagged MED10 (612382), Sato et
al. (2003) purified several components of the human Mediator complex,
including MED18, which they called P28B, and subsequently cloned the
corresponding cDNA.

GENE FUNCTION

Using in vitro-translated epitope-tagged proteins for protein-binding
assays, Sato et al. (2003) found that MED18 directly interacted with the
Mediator subunit TRFP (MED20; 612915). The MED18-TRFP heterodimer could
also be coimmunoprecipitated from cotransfected insect cells.

MAPPING

Hartz (2008) mapped the MED18 gene to chromosome 1p35.3 based on an
alignment of the MED18 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AB107222) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.1).

602673	TITLE *602673 KALLIKREIN-RELATED PEPTIDASE 10; KLK10
;;KALLIKREIN 10;;
PROTEASE, SERINE-LIKE, 1; PRSSL1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

KLK10 belongs to the kallikrein subfamily of serine proteases, which are
involved in a variety of enzymatic processes (Gan et al., 2000).

CLONING

PRSSL1 encodes a 30.14-kD secreted protein that shares 34 to 42% amino
acid identity with several serine protease families (Liu et al., 1996).
PRSSL1 is expressed in normal and immortalized nontumorigenic mammary
epithelial cells but is reduced or absent in numerous human breast
cancer cell lines. Thus, PRSSL1 may play a role in suppression of
tumorigenesis.

By sequencing genomic clones covering the kallikrein gene cluster on
chromosome 19, Gan et al. (2000) identified KLK10, which they called
NES. The deduced 276-amino acid protein contains a putative signal
peptide, followed by a short activating peptide and the protease domain,
which includes the catalytic triad of his86, asp137, and ser229. KLK10
also contains 12 conserved cysteines in its protease domain that are
expected to form 6 disulfide bonds, as in other serine proteases. RT-PCR
detected variable levels of KLK10 expression in nearly all of the 35
adult and fetal tissues examined.

GENE STRUCTURE

Elliott et al. (2006) determined that the KLK10 gene contains 6 exons,
the first of which is noncoding.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Polikoff et al. (1997) mapped the
PRSSL1 gene to 19q13.3. Loss of heterozygosity studies on gliomas showed
frequent allelic loss and a commonly deleted region at 19q13.2-q13.4,
suggesting the presence of a tumor suppressor gene.

By genomic sequence analysis, Gan et al. (2000) mapped the KLK10 gene
within the KLK gene cluster on chromosome 19q13. This cluster includes
13 KLK genes and 5 pseudogenes.

603044	TITLE *603044 PLEOMORPHIC ADENOMA GENE-LIKE 1; PLAGL1
;;ZAC TUMOR SUPPRESSOR GENE; ZAC;;
ZAC1;;
LOST ON TRANSFORMATION 1; LOT1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Spengler et al. (1997) isolated mouse Plagl1, which they designated Zac.
The deduced 667-amino acid protein contains 7 C2H2 zinc fingers in its
N-terminal half. Northern blot analysis of several mouse tissues
detected highest Zac1 expression in pituitary.

Abdollahi et al. (1997) cloned Plagl1 through its loss of expression in
a rat model of epithelial ovarian cancer and named it Lot1 for 'lost on
transformation.' By searching databases for sequences similar to rat
Lot1, followed by clone walking within a human fetal brain cDNA library,
Abdollahi et al. (1997) obtained full-length human LOT1. The deduced
464-amino acid protein has a calculate molecular mass of 51 kD. In
addition to 7 N-terminal zinc fingers, LOT1 contains proline- and
glutamine-rich regions in its C-terminal half. Rat and human LOT1 share
67.7% amino acid identity overall, with 85.5% identity in the N-terminal
zinc finger region. Northern blot analysis detected multiple LOT1
transcripts in all human tissues examined, including spleen, thymus,
prostate, testis, ovary, intestine, colon, and leukocytes. Highest
expression was detected in ovary.

By RT-PCR of normal human leukocytes, Valleley et al. (2007) detected 15
alternatively spliced ZAC transcripts that differed in the promoter
used, the 5-prime noncoding exons included, and the presence or absence
of protein-coding exon 7. The last protein-coding exon, exon 8, was
detected in all transcripts. Transcripts lacking exon 7 encode a short
ZAC isoform with only 5 zinc fingers. The short isoform was more
frequently encoded by transcripts initiated at the upstream promoter
region, P2, and the longer isoform was more frequently encoded by
transcripts initiated at the downstream promoter, P1.

GENE FUNCTION

Spengler et al. (1997) found that mouse Zac inhibited tumor cell
proliferation in vitro and in vivo in nude mice. They showed that these
antiproliferative properties ensued from the regulation of 2 pathways
critical to the activity of p53 (191170), i.e., cell cycle progression
and apoptosis. Thus, mouse Zac was the first gene unrelated to p53 that
was found to regulate these 2 fundamental genetic programs. The authors
hypothesized that Zac also could share with p53 its tumor suppressor
activity.

Varrault et al. (1998) showed that human ZAC had transactivation and
DNA-binding activities. Furthermore, like its mouse counterpart and p53,
ZAC inhibited tumor cell proliferation through induction of both
apoptosis and cell cycle arrest.

Bilanges et al. (2001) found that the long and short ZAC isoforms showed
the same antiproliferative activity. However, the long isoform was more
efficient at inducing apoptosis, whereas the short isoform had a greater
ability to induce cell cycle arrest.

Abdollahi et al. (1997) showed that LOT1 expression was lost in some
human ovarian cancer cell lines.

Kamiya et al. (2000) described a screen for novel imprinted human genes,
and in this way identified the ZAC/PLAGL1 gene as a strong candidate for
transient neonatal diabetes mellitus (TNDM; 601410). To screen for
imprinted genes, they compared parthenogenetic DNA from a chimeric
patient FD and androgenetic DNA from hydatidiform mole, using
restriction landmark genome scanning for methylation. This resulted in
identification of 2 novel imprinted loci, one of which (NV149) mapped to
the TNDM region of 6q24. From analysis of the corresponding genomic
region, it was determined that NV149 lies approximately 60 kb upstream
of the ZAC/PLAGL1 gene. RT-PCR analysis was used to confirm that the
ZAC/PLAGL1 gene is expressed only from the paternal allele in a variety
of tissues. TNDM is known to result from upregulation of a paternally
expressed gene on 6q24. Kamiya et al. (2000) pointed to the paternal
expression, map position, and known biologic properties of ZAC/PLAGL1 as
making it highly likely that it is the TNDM gene. In particular,
ZAC/PLAGL1 is a transcriptional regulator of the type-1 receptor for
pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (102981), which is
the most potent known insulin secretagogue and an important mediator of
autocrine control of insulin secretion in the pancreatic islet.

Arima et al. (2001) showed that the differentially methylated CpG island
that partially overlaps Zac1 and Hymai (606546) at the syntenic mouse
locus is a likely imprinting control region (ICR) for the 120- to 200-kb
domain. The region is unmethylated in sperm but probably methylated in
oocytes, a difference that persists between parental alleles throughout
pre- and postimplantation development. Within this ICR, there is a
region that exhibits a high degree of homology between mouse and human
and acts as a strong transcriptional repressor when methylated. In 5 of
6 TNDM patients studied with a normal karyotype, loss of methylation at
8 CpG sites within the region was demonstrated. The authors proposed
that this ICR may regulate expression of imprinted genes within the
domain, and that epigenetic or genetic mutations of this region probably
result in TNDM by affecting expression of ZAC in the pancreas and/or the
pituitary.

Arima et al. (2006) found that a transgene carrying the human
HYMAI/PLAGL1 differentially methylated CpG island was methylated in the
correct parent origin-specific manner in mice, and that this methylation
was sufficient to confer imprinted expression from the transgene. They
concluded that the differentially methylated CpG island functions as the
imprinting center for the HYMAI/PLAGL1 imprinted domain.

Temple et al. (1995, 1996) showed that 2 genetic abnormalities of
chromosome 6, paternal uniparental isodisomy of chromosome 6 and
paternally inherited duplications of chromosome 6q, are associated with
TNDM. They hypothesized that TNDM could result from inappropriate
overexpression of a paternally expressed imprinted gene on 6q24. Mackay
et al. (2002) demonstrated imprinted expression of the ZAC and HYMAI
genes in cases of TNDM.

By meta-analysis of microarray data, Varrault et al. (2006) identified
Zac1 is a member of a network of coregulated imprinted genes that
control mouse embryonic growth. Zac1 reexpression in a mouse
neuroblastoma cell line lacking Zac1 led to expression of several of
these imprinted genes, including Igf2 (147470), H19 (103280), Cdkn1c
(600856), and Dlk1 (176290), and Zac1 directly regulated the Igf2/H19
locus through binding to a shared enhancer.

Valleley et al. (2007) identified an alternative promoter region, P2, in
the ZAC gene upstream of the differentially methylated promoter, P1.
They showed that the CpG island of P2 was unmethylated and biallelically
expressed. Quantitative real-time PCR detected variable expression of
transcripts derived from both promoters in all human tissues examined.
Transcripts containing imprinted P1 predominated in most tissues, while
transcripts containing the biallelically expressed P2 predominated in
leukocytes. Liver and spleen expressed transcripts from both promoters
relatively equally. In all tissues examined, expression from P1 was
monoallelic and expression from P2 was biallelic.

GENE STRUCTURE

Valleley et al. (2007) determined that the PLAGL1 gene contains at least
8 exons and spans 125 kb. There are 2 alternative promoter regions
separated by about 55 kb, and both lie within CpG islands. Exons 1
through 6 are untranslated and are subject to a complex pattern of
alternative splicing. Coding exon 7 is also alternatively spliced.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Varrault et al. (1998) mapped the
human ZAC gene to chromosome 6q24-q25, a region that shows allelic loss
in breast and ovary cancers, melanomas, astrocytomas, and renal cell
carcinomas, and is thus thought to harbor at least 1 tumor suppressor
gene. The mouse gene maps to chromosome 10A2, a region syntenic to human
6q25.

ANIMAL MODEL

Varrault et al. (2006) found that Zac1 knockdown in mice resulted in
intrauterine growth restriction, altered bone formation, and neonatal
lethality. As expected for a maternally repressed gene, Zac1
+/-(maternal) pups were indistinguishable from wildtype mice, whereas
Zac +/-(paternal) pups displayed the weight reduction observed in Zac1
-/- pups.

604784	TITLE *604784 TRANSCRIPTION ELONGATION FACTOR A, 2; TCEA2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Transcription elongation factors in the SII class (TFIIS), such as
TCEA2, release RNA polymerase II (see 180660) from transcriptional
arrest. For background information on transcription elongation factors,
see TCEA1 (601425).

CLONING

Using the yeast 2-hybrid system with general transcription factor TFIIB
(189963) as bait, Umehara et al. (1995) isolated a human TFIIS cDNA
encoding a 299-amino acid protein. Northern blot analysis showed that
expression of the TFIIS transcript was primarily restricted to testis
and ovary. By screening a human fetal brain genomic library with a probe
corresponding to the 3-prime end of this TFIIS cDNA, Weaver and Kane
(1997) recovered a genomic clone, which they designated TCEA2. The
nucleotide sequence of the 5-prime flanking region contains several
potential regulatory factor-binding sites. The amino acid sequences of
TCEA1 and TCEA2 are 78% identical over the C-terminal region necessary
and sufficient for known in vitro activity.

GENE STRUCTURE

Weaver and Kane (1997) found that the TCEA2 gene contains 7 exons and 6
introns and spans approximately 7 kb.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Wang et al. (2009) reported the crystal structure of RNA polymerase II
in the third state, the reverse translocated or 'backtracked' state. The
defining feature of the backtracked structure is a binding site for the
first backtracked nucleotide. This binding site is occupied in case of
nucleotide misincorporation in the RNA or damage to the DNA, and is
termed the 'P' site because it supports proofreading. The predominant
mechanism of proofreading is the excision of a dinucleotide in the
presence of the TFIIS elongation factor. Structure determination of a
cocrystal with TFIIS revealed a rearrangement whereby cleavage of the
RNA may take place.

606202	TITLE *606202 SOLUTE CARRIER FAMILY 45, MEMBER 2; SLC45A2
;;MEMBRANE-ASSOCIATED TRANSPORTER PROTEIN; MATP;;
MELANOMA ANTIGEN AIM1; AIM1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The AIM1 gene encodes a melanocyte differentiation antigen that is
expressed in a high percentage of melanoma cell lines. Its homolog in
medaka fish, 'B,' encodes a transporter that mediates melanin synthesis
(Fukamachi et al., 2001).

CLONING

Harada et al. (2001) identified an antigen in human melanoma that they
called AIM1 protein. The AIM1 gene was expressed in 3 melanoma cell
lines, but not in a fibroblast cell line, and not at significant levels
in any of 15 normal tissues. The human AIM1 gene encodes a protein of
530 amino acids. Northern blot analysis detected 2 transcripts, one of
1.7 kb and the other of 2.8 kb. Harada et al. (2001) concluded that the
AIM1 gene encodes a melanocyte differentiation antigen that is expressed
in a high percentage of melanoma cell lines.

Fukamachi et al. (2001) used a positional cloning effort to isolate a
medaka pigment gene highly homologous to human AIM1. This gene encodes a
transporter that mediates melanin synthesis. The medaka AIM1 protein
consists of 12 transmembrane domains and is 55% identical to human AIM1.
Fukamachi et al. (2001) also isolated a highly homologous gene from the
mouse, indicating a conserved function of vertebrate melanogenesis.

Newton et al. (2001) identified the human AIM1 gene, which they
designated MATP, by study of human chromosome 5p, a region showing
syntenic homology with the proximal region of mouse chromosome 15 where
the underwhite (uw) locus maps. They cloned the human MATP and mouse uw
cDNAs and determined that the deduced human and mouse proteins share 82%
sequence identity. Both proteins are approximately 58 kD and are
predicted to span a lipid bilayer 12 times.

GENE FUNCTION

Du and Fisher (2002) determined that MATP is transcriptionally modulated
by MITF (156845), a melanocyte-specific transcription factor. Chromatin
immunoprecipitation did not detect direct binding of MITF to a 5-prime
flanking region of MATP, suggesting that MITF may act indirectly or may
bind to a remote regulatory sequence.

GENE STRUCTURE

Newton et al. (2001) determined that the SLC45A2 gene contains 7 exons
spanning a region of approximately 40 kb.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Newton et al. (2001) mapped the SLC45A2 gene to
chromosome 5p.

EVOLUTION

Sabeti et al. (2007) reported an analysis of over 3 million
polymorphisms from the International HapMap Project Phase 2. The
analysis revealed more than 300 strong candidate regions that appeared
to have undergone recent natural selection. Examination of 22 of the
strongest regions highlighted 3 cases in which 2 genes in a common
biologic process had apparently undergone positive selection in the same
population: LARGE (603590) and DMD (300377), both related to infection
by the Lassa virus, in West Africa; SLC24A5 (609802) and SLC45A2, both
involved in skin pigmentation, in Europe; and EDAR (604095) and EDA2R
(300276), both involved in the development of hair follicles, in Asia.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Oculocutaneous Albinism Type IV

In a Turkish patient with oculocutaneous albinism type IV (OCA4;
606574), Newton et al. (2001) identified a homozygous mutation in the
MATP gene (606202.0001).

Rundshagen et al. (2004) screened 176 German patients with albinism for
mutations in the MATP gene; in 5, they identified homozygous or compound
heterozygous mutations (see 606202.0002-606202.0005).

In 18 of 75 (24%) Japanese patients with OCA, Inagaki et al. (2004)
identified 7 mutations in the MATP gene (see, e.g., 606202.0006).

- Normal Pigment Variation

Studying Caucasians, Asians, African Americans, and Australian
Aborigines, Graf et al. (2005) found association particularly with 2
polymorphisms, G272K (606202.0007) and F374L (606202.0008), with normal
variation in human pigmentation (SHEP5; 227240).

Graf et al. (2007) examined the association between normal skin color
variation in several populations and 3 different promoter polymorphisms
in the MATP gene: -1721C-G (dbSNP rs13289), -1169G-A (dbSNP rs6867641),
and a 3-bp duplication, -1174dupAAT. In Caucasian samples, -1721C-G and
-1174dupAAT were in complete linkage disequilibrium. In Caucasians only,
the -1721G, -1169A, and +dup alleles were significantly associated with
olive skin color. Functional analysis in melanoma skin cells showed that
this promoter haplotype decreased MATP transcription, suggesting a
functional significance.

Stokowski et al. (2007) demonstrated an association between the SNP
dbSNP rs16891982 (F374L; 606202.0008) and skin pigmentation variation in
individuals of South Asian descent.

ANIMAL MODEL

Newton et al. (2001) and Du and Fisher (2002) determined that mutations
in the mouse Matp gene underlie the underwhite (uw) pigmentation
phenotype. Underwhite alleles manifest altered pigmentation of both eye
and fur, sometimes in an age-dependent fashion.

Xu et al. (2013) found that white tigers, characterized by white fur and
dark stripes, are homozygous for a C-to-T transition in exon 7 of the
Slc45a2 gene, resulting in an ala477-to-val (A477V) substitution in
transmembrane domain 11. Homology modeling suggested that A477 faces the
inner surface of the transporter cavity and that its mutation may hinder
substrate transport. Xu et al. (2013) hypothesized that Slc45a2 may be a
sucrose/proton symporter that regulates organellar pH and/or osmotic
balance for synthesis of red/yellow pheomelanin, with little or no
effect on the synthesis of black eumelanin.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
OCULOCUTANEOUS ALBINISM, TYPE IV
SLC45A2, IVS2, G-A, -1

In a Turkish patient with oculocutaneous albinism type IV (606574),
whose generalized hypopigmentation and ocular abnormalities were
relatively mild, Newton et al. (2001) identified a homozygous G-to-A
transition in the splice acceptor sequence of exon 2 of the SLC45A2
gene. The patient's parents were heterozygous for this mutation. The
authors noted that the mutation likely results in the in-frame deletion
of exon 2, which codes for transmembrane domain-4, and would result in a
change in the orientation of transmembrane domains 5-12 relative to the
membrane.

.0002
OCULOCUTANEOUS ALBINISM, TYPE IV
SLC45A2, LEU361PRO

In a German patient with oculocutaneous albinism type IV (606574),
Rundshagen et al. (2004) identified a homozygous 1082T-C transition in
exon 5 of the MATP gene, resulting in a leu361-to-pro (L361P) change.
Each parent was heterozygous for the mutation.

.0003
OCULOCUTANEOUS ALBINISM, TYPE IV
SLC45A2, 1-BP DEL, 986C

In 2 German patients with oculocutaneous albinism type IV (606574),
Rundshagen et al. (2004) identified a 1-bp deletion in exon 4 of the
MATP gene, 986delC, resulting in a frameshift at codon 329 and a
translation stop in exon 6. In each patient the frameshift mutation was
present in compound heterozygous state: in one patient with a 3-bp
deletion (nucleotides 661-663), resulting in deletion of phe221
(606202.0004), and in the other with an A486V mutation (606202.0005).

See 606202.0003 and Rundshagen et al. (2004).

.0006
OCULOCUTANEOUS ALBINISM, TYPE IV
SLC45A2, ASP157ASN

In 2 Japanese patients with oculocutaneous albinism type IV (606574),
Inagaki et al. (2004) identified homozygosity for a G-to-A transition in
exon 2 of the MATP gene, resulting in an asp157-to-asn (D157N)
substitution. The mutation occurs at the first residue in the second
cytoplasmic loop of the protein. Ten other patients had 1 D157N mutant
allele; the allele frequency of D157N in all patients with OCA4 was
0.39, indicating that it is the most common mutant allele in Japanese
patients with OCA4.

Inagaki et al. (2005) investigated the haplotypes of 20 alleles carrying
the D157N mutation from 1 Korean and 21 Japanese OCA4 patients and found
1 Korean and 12 Japanese alleles to be associated with so-called
'haplotype 15' (G-A-G-A-G), consistent with a founder effect for the
D157N mutation in East Asia.

.0007
SKIN/HAIR/EYE PIGMENTATION 5, BLACK/NONBLACK HAIR
SKIN/HAIR/EYE PIGMENTATION 5, DARK/FAIR SKIN, INCLUDED;;
SKIN/HAIR/EYE PIGMENTATION 5, DARK/LIGHT EYES, INCLUDED
SLC45A2, GLU272LYS

In Caucasians, Graf et al. (2005) found a significant association
between 2 polymorphisms of the MATP gene, an 814G-A transition resulting
in a glu272-to-lys substitution (G272K) and a 1122C-G transversion
resulting in a phe374-to-leu substitution (F374L; 606202.0008). The 2
alleles, leu374 and lys272, were significantly associated with dark
hair, skin, and eye color in Caucasians (SHEP5; 227240). The odds ratios
of the leu/leu genotype for black hair and olive skin were 25.63 and
28.65, respectively, and for the lys/lys genotype were 43.23 and 8.27,
respectively. The odds ratio for eye color was lower at 3.48 for the
leu/leu and 6.57 for the lys/lys genotypes.

.0008
SKIN/HAIR/EYE PIGMENTATION 5, BLACK/NONBLACK HAIR
SKIN/HAIR/EYE PIGMENTATION 5, DARK/FAIR SKIN, INCLUDED;;
SKIN/HAIR/EYE PIGMENTATION 5, DARK/LIGHT EYES, INCLUDED
SLC45A2, PHE374LEU

See 606202.0007 and Graf et al. (2005).

Yuasa et al. (2006), who referred to this polymorphism as L374F, studied
the distribution of the F374 allele in 1,649 unrelated subjects from 13
Eurasian populations and 1 African population. The highest allele
frequency was observed in Germans (0.965); French and Italians showed
somewhat lower frequencies; and Turks had an intermediate value (0.615).
Indians and Bangladeshis from South Asia were characterized by low
frequencies (0.147 and 0.059, respectively). They also found the F374
allele in some East and Southeast Asian populations, and explained this
by admixture. Haplotype analysis revealed that the haplotype diversity
was much lower in Germans than in Japanese, suggesting that the L374F
mutation occurred only once in the ancestry of Caucasians. The large
differences in distribution of the F374 allele and its haplotype
suggested that this allele may be an important factor in
hypopigmentation in Caucasian populations.

In a genomewide association study of skin pigmentation variation (SHEP5;
227240) using 1,620,742 SNPs in a population of 737 individuals of South
Asian ancestry living in the United Kingdom, Stokowski et al. (2007)
found association of the SLC45A2 SNP dbSNP rs16891982 (L374F) with skin
pigmentation. The association was replicated in a second independent
cohort of 235 individuals.

Stacey et al. (2009) confirmed the association of the dbSNP rs16891982
variant with fair pigmentation and found association of this SNP with
susceptibility to basal cell carcinoma in 3,326 basal cell carcinoma
cases and 5,493 controls of European ancestry (odds ratio = 1.97, P =
1.6 x 10(-12)).

Guedj et al. (2008) analyzed the F374L variant in 1,019 Caucasian
melanoma patients (see 155600) and 1,466 Caucasian controls and found an
association for protection from melanoma (p = 2.12 x 10(-15); odds ratio
= 0.35 and 0.32 for the F/L and F/F genotypes, respectively). The
association remained significant in a logistic model integrating
pigmentation characteristics (p = 4.16 x 10(-3)).

In a Spanish case-control study involving 131 consecutive melanoma
patients and 245 controls, Fernandez et al. (2008) found the F374L
variant of the SLC45A2 gene to be associated with protection from
malignant melanoma (odds ratio = 0.41; p = 0.008 after adjustment for
multiple testing). Adjustment for 6 potential confounders (age,
blond/red hair color, fair/pale skin color, solar lentigines, number of
nevi, and the presence of childhood sunburn) reduced the estimated
degree of protection (odds ratio = 0.56; p = 0.08), reflecting their
likely participation in the causal pathway. Only blond/red hair color
and childhood sunburns were independently associated with risk of
malignant melanoma; adjustment for those 2 covariates gave an estimated
per allele odds ratio of 0.55 (p = 0.05) for the F374L variant.

.0009
OCULOCUTANEOUS ALBINISM, TYPE IV
SLC45A2, 1-BP DEL, 1121T

In 2 Brazilian sibs with oculocutaneous albinism type IV (606574),
Lezirovitz et al. (2006) identified a homozygous 1-bp deletion
(1121delT) in exon 5 of the MATP gene, resulting in a frameshift and
premature termination of the protein at codon 397. One of the affected
sibs also had sensorineural deafness (DFNB1; 220290) associated with a
homozygous mutation in the GJB2 gene (121011.0005). Lezirovitz et al.
(2006) concluded that congenital deafness and oculocutaneous albinism
due to mutations in 2 different genes as seen in their Brazilian family
suggested a similar coincident inheritance of 2 separate recessive
disorders in the Sephardic family reported by Ziprkowski and Adam (1964)
(see 220900).

610232	TITLE *610232 ATPase, TYPE 13A3; ATP13A3
;;ATPase FAMILY HOMOLOG UPREGULATED IN SENESCENCE CELLS; AFURS1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ATP13A3 is a member of the P-type ATPase family of proteins that
transport a variety of cations across membranes. Other P-type ATPases
include ATP7B (606882) and ATP7A (300011).

CLONING

Using suppressive subtractive hybridization of senescent human kidney
parenchymal cells, followed by PCR and database analysis, Habtemichael
and Kovacs (2002) cloned the ATP13A3 gene, which they called AFURS1. The
deduced 701-amino acid protein has a predicted molecular mass of 77.31
kD and contains an E1-E2 ATPase domain, a hydrolase domain, 3 predicted
transmembrane domains, and a highly conserved ATPase phosphorylation
site. ATP13A3 shares 46% identity with human ATP13A2. Northern blot
analysis detected upregulated expression of AFURS1 in senescent kidney
parenchymal cells compared to exponentially growing cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Habtemichael and Kovacs (2002) determined that the ATP13A3 gene contains
18 exons. They suggested that the very long 5-prime UTR may form a
secondary structure that mediates translational regulation.

MAPPING

By database analysis, Habtemichael and Kovacs (2002) mapped the ATP13A3
gene to chromosome 3q26.32.
