615262	TITLE *615262 METHYLTRANSFERASE-LIKE 23; METTL23
;;CHROMOSOME 17 OPEN READING FRAME 95; C17ORF95
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Methyltransferases catalyze the transfer of a methyl group from a donor,
generally S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet), to acceptor molecules,
including proteins, DNA, RNA, lipids, and small metabolites. METTL23
belongs to a family of protein lysine methyltransferases that methylate
nonhistone proteins (Cloutier et al., 2013).

CLONING

By searching databases for sequences similar to METTL22 (615261),
Cloutier et al. (2013) identified METTL23. The deduced protein is made
up predominantly of a Rossmann fold of alternating beta strands and
alpha helices, with a conserved AdoMet-binding site near the N terminus.
Epitope-tagged METTL23 was predominantly expressed in cytoplasmic
membrane-like structures in transfected HeLa cells.

GENE FUNCTION

By affinity purification, SDS-PAGE, and mass spectrometry, Cloutier et
al. (2013) found that METTL23 expressed in HEK293 cells interacted with
HSPA5 (138120), tubulin (see 602529), and UGGT1 (605897). UGGT2 (605898)
and HSP90B1 (191175) were also detected in the immunoprecipitate.

MAPPING

Hartz (2013) mapped the METTL23 gene to chromosome 17q25.1 based on an
alignment of the METTL23 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC033998) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

602945	TITLE *602945 TRANSCRIPTIONAL ADAPTOR 3; TADA3
;;TRANSCRIPTIONAL ADAPTOR 3-LIKE; TADA3L;;
ADA3, YEAST, HOMOLOG OF; ADA3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TADA3 is a subunit of 2 histone acetyltransferase complexes: the ADA2A
(TADA2A; 602276)-containing (ATAC) complex and the SPT3 (SUPT3H;
602947)-TAF9 (600822)-GCN5 (KAT2A; 602301)/PCAF (KAT2B; 602303)
acetylase (STAGA) complex. Both of these complexes contain either GCN5
or PCAF, which are paralogous acetyltransferases (Wang et al., 2008).

CLONING

Ogryzko et al. (1998) identified the human polypeptide TADA3L, which
they called ADA3, as a subunit of the PCAF complex. The predicted
protein contains 433 amino acids and shows 45% sequence similarity with
yeast ADA3.

Using the E6 protein of human papillomavirus as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid
screen of a mammary epithelial cell line, Kumar et al. (2002) cloned
TADA3L. Northern blot analysis revealed variable levels of expression of
a 1.3-kb transcript in all tissues and cell lines tested.

GENE FUNCTION

Struhl and Moqtaderi (1998) reviewed the potential roles of the PCAF
complex, which includes ADA3, in transcription.

Using a yeast p53 (191170) dissociator assay, Wang et al. (2001)
determined that TADA3L, a part of histone acetyltransferase (HAT)
complexes, acts as a cofactor for p53 activity. They demonstrated direct
interaction between TADA3L and p53 in cotransfected cells. By mutation
analysis, Wang et al. (2001) showed that the N terminus of TADA3L
interacts with the N terminus of p53, while the C terminus of TADA3L
interacts with ADA2 (TADA2L; 602276) and p300 (EP300; 602700),
components of HAT complexes. Following DNA damage, p53 was
phosphorylated at its N terminus, and this enhanced the amount of p53
that could be coimmunoprecipitated with TADA3L. The N terminus of TADA3L
alone could inhibit p53 transcriptional activity and could prevent
p53-mediated apoptosis.

Kumar et al. (2002) determined that TADA3L could bind the E6 protein of
human papillomavirus in vivo and in vitro if the E6 protein carried
mutations associated with high cancer risk. TADA3L did not bind E6
variants associated with benign lesions. Cotransfection of TADA3L and E6
in 293T cells induced a dramatic decrease in the TADA3L protein level
that was reversed upon treatment with a proteasome inhibitor. Kumar et
al. (2002) confirmed interaction of p53 with TADA3L in
TADA3L-transfected osteosarcoma cells and found that coexpression of E6
markedly inhibited TADA3L/p53-mediated transactivation.

Using mass spectrometry, Wang et al. (2008) identified ADA3 as a subunit
of both the ATAC and STAGA complexes in HeLa cells.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the TADA3L
gene to chromosome 3 (TMAP WI-14334).

164015	TITLE *164015 MATRIN 3; MATR3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Stuurman et al. (1990) showed that nuclear matrins, a group of proteins
in the nuclear matrix, are present in cultured cells from a variety of
tissues and are probably common to mammalian cells. Stuurman et al.
(1990) differentiated 2 nuclear matrix fractions: the peripheral nuclear
matrix (matrix proteins that remain insoluble after reduction), and the
internal nuclear matrix (matrix proteins released by reduction).

Nakayasu and Berezney (1991) identified several novel nuclear matrins
from a rat liver nuclear matrix and characterized them by peptide maps,
polyclonal antibodies generated against the individual matrins, and
indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. They designated the proteins
matrins 3, 4, D-G, 12, and 13.

Belgrader et al. (1991) cloned a full-length rat insulinoma cDNA that
encodes an acidic internal matrix protein designated matrin-3. The
deduced 845-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of
approximately 95 kD. Its primary structure consists of 33% charged
residues and is generally hydrophilic. Like the lamins (see 150330),
matrin-3 has a positively charged N terminus that contains a large
number of amino acids with free hydroxyl groups. A highly acidic domain
near the C terminus, in which 32% of the amino acids are acidic, is a
characteristic found in other nuclear proteins.

Nagase et al. (1998) cloned and sequenced matrin-3, which they called
KIAA0723, from human brain cDNA libraries. The deduced protein contains
847 amino acids.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the MATR3
gene to chromosome 5 (TMAP WI-15469).

Using genomic sequence analysis, Senderek et al. (2009) mapped the MATR3
gene to chromosome 5q31.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 2 unrelated families with a form of distal myopathy that included
vocal cord and pharyngeal weakness (MPD2; 606070), Senderek et al.
(2009) identified the same missense mutation in the MATR3 gene (S85C;
164015.0001).

MYOPATHY, DISTAL, 2
MATR3, SER85CYS

In affected members of a North American family originally reported by
Feit et al. (1998) and in an unrelated Bulgarian family with distal
myopathy with vocal cord and pharyngeal weakness (MPD2; 606070),
Senderek et al. (2009) identified heterozygosity for a C-to-G
transversion at nucleotide 254 in exon 2 of the MATR3 gene that resulted
in a change from serine to cysteine at codon 85 (S85C).

611118	TITLE *611118 NUCLEAR PRELAMIN A RECOGNITION FACTOR-LIKE; NARFL
;;IRON-ONLY HYDROGENASE-LIKE PROTEIN 1; IOP1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis to screen a human adult kidney cDNA
library with PHD2 (EGLN1; 606425) as bait, Huang et al. (2007) cloned
NARFL, which they called IOP1. The deduced 476-amino acid NARFL protein
shares similarity with several bacterial iron-only hydrogenases,
including conservation of a distinctive active site iron sulfur cluster,
termed the H cluster, and a second iron-sulfur cluster contained in a
ferredoxin-like domain. NARFL shares 47% sequence identity over the
hydrogenase domain with nuclear prelamin A recognition factor (NARF;
605349). Northern blot analysis detected wide expression of a 2.4-kb
NARFL transcript, with high expression in heart and skeletal muscle.
Huang et al. (2007) detected no change in NARFL protein levels in
response to hypoxia exposure of HEK293 cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Huang et al. (2007) found that knockdown of NARFL with siRNA induced
expression of the alpha subunit of transcription factor hypoxia-induced
factor-1 (HIF1A; 603348) mRNA and protein, and potentiated
hypoxia-induced activation of HIF reporter genes and endogenous HIF
target genes. Using siRNA knockdown of both NARFL and PHD2, Huang et al.
(2007) concluded that the NARFL siRNA knockdown-mediated increase in
HIF1A occurs in a PHD2-independent manner.

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a human kidney cDNA library to identify
IOP1-interacting proteins, Song et al. (2009) identified ISCA1 (611006).
Immunoprecipitation analysis showed that the interaction required 3
conserved cysteines in ISCA1 predicted to be involved in binding
iron/sulfur clusters. Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of ISCA1
in HeLa cells resulted in decreased activity of 2 mitochondrial
iron-sulfur enzymes, succinate dehydrogenase (see 600857) and aconitase
(ACO2; 100850), as well the cytosolic iron-sulfur enzyme aconitase
(ACO1; 100880). Song et al. (2009) proposed that ISCA1 is important in
both mitochondrial and cytosolic iron-sulfur biogenesis and that the
cytosolic activity is affected by its interaction with IOP1.

MAPPING

Hartz (2011) mapped the NARFL gene to chromosome 16p13.3 based on an
alignment of the NARFL sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK025641) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

Song and Lee (2011) stated that the mouse Narfl gene maps to chromosome
17.

ANIMAL MODEL

Song and Lee (2011) found that Iop1 deletion in mice was lethal prior to
embryonic day 10.5. In addition, fewer than expected Iop1 +/- mice were
born, suggesting that even haploinsufficiency of Iop1 is deleterious.
Conditional Iop1 deletion in adult mice resulted in 100% lethality 5
days following activation of the deletion. Prior to death, Iop1 knockout
caused substantial loss of liver activity of the iron-sulfur cluster
protein cytosolic aconitase (ACO1; 100880), but not mitochondrial
aconitase (ACO2; 100850). Song and Lee (2011) noted that upon loss of
its active-site iron-sulfur cluster, cytosolic aconitase is converted to
the transcriptional regulator Irp1, which induces upregulation of
transferrin receptor (TFR1, or TFRC; 190010). Conditional deletion of
Iop1 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts led to Tfr1 upregulation and cell
death within 3 days, which was accompanied by induction of autophagy,
stress-induced biochemical pathways, and apoptosis. Song and Lee (2011)
concluded that IOP1 has an essential role in cytosolic iron-sulfur
cluster biogenesis.

613555	TITLE *613555 TET ONCOGENE FAMILY, MEMBER 3; TET3
;;KIAA0401
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the ten-eleven translocation (TET) gene family, including
TET3, play a role in the DNA methylation process (Langemeijer et al.,
2009).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Ishikawa et al. (1997) cloned partial TET3, which they
designated KIAA0401. RT-PCR showed expression in a variety of human
tissues, most prominently in brain, placenta, lung, and thymus.

Langemeijer et al. (2009) noted that the deduced TET3 protein contains
1,660 amino acids and shares 2 C-terminal highly conserved domains, a
cys-rich region and a 2OGFeDO homology domain, with TET1 (607790) and
TET2 (612839). By real-time PCR analysis, they demonstrated that TET3,
like TET2, is ubiquitously expressed with highest expression in
hematopoietic cells, particularly of myeloid and monocytic lineage.

GENE FUNCTION

In a computational search for enzymes that could modify 5-methylcytosine
(5mC), Tahiliani et al. (2009) identified TET proteins as mammalian
homologs of the trypanosome proteins JBP1 and JBP2, which have been
proposed to oxidize the 5-methyl group of thymine. They showed that
TET1, a fusion partner of the MLL gene in acute myeloid leukemia, is a
2-oxoglutarate (2OG)- and Fe(II)-dependent enzyme that catalyzes
conversion of 5mC to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in cultured cells
and in vitro. 5hmC is present in the genome of mouse embryonic stem
cells, and 5hmC levels decrease upon RNA interference-mediated depletion
of TET1. Thus, Tahiliani et al. (2009) concluded that TET proteins have
potential roles in epigenetic regulation through modification of 5mC to
5hmC.

Ito et al. (2010) extended the study of Tahiliani et al. (2009) by
demonstrating that all 3 mouse TET proteins, Tet1, Tet2, and Tet3, can
also catalyze the conversion of 5mC to 5hmC. Tet1 has an important role
in mouse embryonic stem cell maintenance through maintaining the
expression of Nanog (607937) in embryonic stem cells. Downregulation of
Nanog via Tet1 knockdown correlated with methylation of the Nanog
promoter, supporting a role for Tet1 in regulating DNA methylation
status. Furthermore, knockdown of Tet1 in preimplantation embryos
resulted in a bias towards trophectoderm differentiation. Thus, Ito et
al. (2010) concluded that their studies not only uncovered the enzymatic
activity of the Tet proteins, but also demonstrated a role for Tet1 in
embryonic stem cell maintenance and inner cell mass cell specification.

Ito et al. (2011) showed that, in addition to 5hmC, the Tet proteins can
generate 5-formylcytosine (5fC) and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC) from 5mC
in an enzymatic activity-dependent manner. Furthermore, Ito et al.
(2011) revealed the presence of 5fC and 5caC in genomic DNA of mouse
embryonic stem cells and mouse organs. The genomic content of 5hmC, 5fC,
and 5caC can be increased or reduced through overexpression or depletion
of Tet proteins. Thus, Ito et al. (2011) concluded that they identified
2 previously unknown cytosine derivatives in genomic DNA as the products
of Tet proteins, and raised the possibility that DNA demethylation may
occur through Tet-catalyzed oxidation followed by decarboxylation.

He et al. (2011) demonstrated that 5mC and 5hmC in DNA are oxidized to
5caC by Tet dioxygenases in vitro and in cultured cells. 5caC is
specifically recognized and excised by thymine-DNA glycosylase (TDG;
601423). Depletion of TDG in mouse embryonic stem cells leads to
accumulation of 5caC to a readily detectable level. He et al. (2011)
concluded that oxidation of 5mC by Tet proteins followed by TDG-mediated
base excision of 5caC constitutes a pathway for active DNA
demethylation.

Gu et al. (2011) reported that, within mouse zygotes, oxidation of
5-methylcytosine (5mC) occurs on the paternal genome, changing 5mC into
5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). Furthermore, they demonstrated that the
dioxygenase Tet3 is enriched specifically in the male pronucleus. In
Tet3-deficient zygotes from conditional knockout mice, paternal genome
conversion of 5mC into 5hmC failed to occur and the level of 5mC remains
constant. Deficiency of Tet3 also impeded the demethylation process of
the paternal Oct4 (164177) and Nanog genes and delayed the subsequent
activation of a paternally derived Oct4 transgene in early embryos.
Female mice depleted of Tet3 in the germline showed severely reduced
fecundity, and their heterozygous mutant offspring lacking maternal Tet3
suffered an increased incidence of developmental failure. Oocytes
lacking Tet3 also seemed to have a reduced ability to reprogram the
injected nuclei from somatic cells. Therefore, Gu et al. (2011)
concluded that Tet3-mediated DNA hydroxylation is involved in epigenetic
reprogramming of the zygotic paternal DNA following natural
fertilization and may also contribute to somatic cell nuclear
reprogramming during animal cloning.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Ishikawa et al. (1997) mapped the TET3
gene to chromosome 2.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Genes encoding Ced proteins in worms are crucial for initiating
apoptosis during development. Mammalian Ced4 homologs include APAF1
(602233) and NOD1/CARD4 (605980). DEFCAP is a member of the mammalian
family of Ced4 proteins and is capable of inducing apoptosis (Hlaing et
al., 2001).

CLONING

By screening for cDNAs encoding large proteins expressed in brain,
Nagase et al. (1999) identified a cDNA encoding KIAA0926. The deduced
1,429-amino acid protein is predicted to be 42% identical to a placental
ribonuclease inhibitor (RNH; 173320). RT-PCR analysis detected weak
expression in most tissues, with highest expression in spleen.

By protein database searching for pyrin (608107) domain (PYD)-containing
proteins, Martinon et al. (2001) identified NALP1 and NALP2 (609364), so
symbolized for 'NACHT-, LRR-, and PYD-containing proteins.' The authors
noted that NACHT and LRR domains are found in proteins involved in
inflammation or apoptosis, such as NAIP (600355) and CIITA (600005).
Sequence analysis suggested that PYD, along with the domains DED, CARD,
and DD, is a fourth potential member of the death-domain-fold
superfamily. However, binding analysis indicated that PYD-containing
proteins interact only with other PYD proteins.

By database searching and PCR of a chronic myelogenous leukemia (K562)
cDNA library with primers based on KIAA0926, Hlaing et al. (2001)
isolated cDNAs encoding short and long isoforms of death effector
filament-forming Ced4-like apoptosis protein, or DEFCAP-S and DEFCAP-L.
The longer isoform includes a 132-bp insertion encoding an additional
leucine-rich repeat (LRR) in a 1,473-amino acid protein. Sequence
analysis predicted that both proteins contain a C-terminal CARD domain,
LRRs, and a nucleotide-binding domain, in different positions from those
of NOD1 and APAF1. An N-terminal pyrin-like motif (PLM) is conserved
with other mammalian proteins such as ASC (CARD5), and is evolutionarily
conserved, as seen in sequence alignments with zebrafish ASC1. Northern
blot analysis revealed expression of approximately 7.0- and 8.0-kb
transcripts in most tissues, with highest levels in peripheral blood
leukocytes, heart, thymus, and spleen, but none in brain. High levels
were detected in K562 cells, with weaker or no expression in other
cancer cell lines. Semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis detected both
isoforms in normal tissue and cancer cell lines. Fluorescence microscopy
demonstrated a diffuse cytoplasmic localization.

Soler et al. (2013) examined NLRP1 expression in human fetal and adult
ocular tissues obtained from dissected whole globes, and observed
expression in adult cornea as well as adult and 24-week fetal tissues,
including choroid, sclera, cornea, optic nerve, and adult retina and
fetal retina/retinal pigment epithelium. In addition, NLRP1 was
expressed in corneal epithelia obtained during photorefractive
keratectomy.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1999) mapped the KIAA0926
gene to chromosome 17. By the same method, Hlaing et al. (2001) mapped
the DEFCAP gene to chromosome 17p13.

GENE FUNCTION

By immunoprecipitation analysis, Hlaing et al. (2001) demonstrated that
both DEFCAP isoforms interacted strongly with CASP2 (600639), but only
weakly with CASP9 (602234). Transient overexpression of full-length
DEFCAP-L, but not DEFCAP-S, in breast adenocarcinoma cells resulted in
significant apoptosis.

Decreasing oocyte competence with maternal aging is a major factor in
human infertility. To investigate the age-dependent molecular changes in
a mouse model, Hamatani et al. (2004) compared the expression profiles
of metaphase II oocytes collected from 5- to 6-week-old mice with those
collected from 42- to 45-week-old mice using a 22K oligo microarray.
Among approximately 11,000 genes whose transcripts were detected, about
5% showed statistically significant expression changes. Among the
transcripts decreased with aging was a group of oocyte-specific genes,
members of the human NACHT, leucine-rich repeat and PYD-containing
(NALP) gene family.

Using purified recombinant proteins, Faustin et al. (2007) reconstituted
the NALP1 inflammasome to characterize the requirements for inflammasome
assembly and CASP1 (147678) activation. NALP1 oligomerized in a 2-step
process that required a microbial product, muramyl-dipeptide, followed
by ribonucleotide triphosphates. CASP1 activation by NALP1 was enhanced
by ASC (PYCARD; 606838). Faustin et al. (2007) concluded that NALP1 is a
direct sensor of bacterial components in host defense against pathogens.

Guarda et al. (2009) incubated mouse splenocyte naive, memory, and
regulatory T-cell subsets with bone marrow-derived macrophages and
stimulated them with anti-Cd3 (see 186740), followed by
lipopolysaccharide activation and ATP stimulation. They found that
inflammasome-mediated Casp1 activation and secretion of mature Il1b
(147720) was blocked in the presence of memory Cd4 (186940)-positive T
cells, but not other T-cell subsets. Subsequent investigation showed
that multiple activators of Nalp1 and Nalp3 (NLRP3; 606416), but not
Nlrc4 (606831), were inhibited in inflammasome function by memory or in
vitro-activated Cd4-positive T cells. Suppression of Nalp3 inflammasome
function required cell-to-cell contact. Effector Cd4-positive T cells
also decreased neutrophil recruitment in an Nalp3-dependent peritonitis
mouse model. Guarda et al. (2009) concluded that effector and memory
CD4-positive T cells selectively inhibit NALP1 and NALP3 inflammasomes.

Gregory et al. (2011) found that the Kaposi sarcoma-associated
herpesvirus (KSHV) Orf63 is a viral homolog of human NLRP1. Orf63
blocked NLRP1-dependent innate immune responses, including CASP1
activation and processing of interleukins IL1B and IL18 (600953). KSHV
Orf63 interacted with NLRP1, NLRP3, and NOD2 (605956). Inhibition of
Orf63 expression resulted in increased expression of IL1B during the
KSHV life cycle. Furthermore, inhibition of NLRP1 was necessary for
efficient reactivation and generation of progeny virus. The viral
homolog subverts the function of cellular NLRs, which suggested to
Gregory et al. (2011) that modulation of NLR-mediated innate immunity is
important for the lifelong persistence of herpesviruses.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Vitiligo-Associated Autoimmune Disease Susceptibility

Among patients with generalized vitiligo there is an increased frequency
of several autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases (Jin et al., 2007).
There is also an increased frequency of these same disorders among
first-degree relatives of patients with vitiligo, suggesting that some
families have a genetic predisposition to this group of autoimmune and
autoinflammatory diseases. To identify the gene responsible for
vitiligo-related autoimmune disease susceptibility associated with the
17p13 region (VAMAS1; 606579), Jin et al. (2007) performed fine-scale
genetic association and DNA sequence analyses in 114 families with
vitiligo and associated autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases.
Association analyses resulted in identification of NALP1 as a candidate
gene. Fine-scale association mapping using DNA from affected families
and additional SNPs in and around NALP1 showed an association of
specific variants with vitiligo alone, with an extended autoimmune and
autoinflammatory disease phenotype, or with both. Conditional
logistic-regression analysis of NALP1 SNPs indicated that at least 2
variants contribute independently to the risk of disease. Jin et al.
(2007) identified 15 SNPs in the NALP1 region predicted to result in
nonsynonymous amino acid substitutions in the NALP1 protein. Only 1 of
these (leu155 to his; 606636.0001) showed evidence in association, both
with vitiligo alone and with autoimmune inflammatory diseases (p = 0.002
and p = 0.001, respectively, by pedigree disequilibrium test). Five of 6
tightly linked SNPs in the promoter region of NALP1 that were associated
with disease were found to affect high-probability mammalian
transcription factor binding sites.

- Corneal Intraepithelial Dyskeratosis with Ectodermal Dysplasia

In an affected mother and son from a Caucasian French family segregating
autosomal dominant corneal intraepithelial dyskeratosis and ectodermal
dysplasia (CIDED; 615225), Soler et al. (2013) identified heterozygosity
for a missense mutation in the NLRP1 gene (M77T; 606636.0002) that
segregated with the disease and was not found in 672 controls or in 61
exome-sequenced subjects' DNA.

EVOLUTION

Using a population genetics approach to define the ways in which natural
selection has driven evolution of NOD-like microbial receptors (NLRs) in
various human populations, Vasseur et al. (2012) identified 2,084 SNPs,
including 396 nonsynonymous SNPs, 4 nonsense variants, and 12 coding
region insertion/deletions. Overall, members of the NALP subfamily,
which includes NLRP1 through NLRP14 (609665), had undergone strong
purifying selection with little functional diversity. In contrast,
members of the NOD/IPAF subfamily, which includes NOD1 through NOD4
(NLRC5; 613537), as well as NOD9 (NLRX1; 611947), CIITA, and NLRC4, had
undergone weak negative selection. After expanding their studies to
include other major families of microbial sensors, Vasseur et al. (2012)
distinguished 3 groups of innate immunity genes that differed in their
evolutionary patterns: those under strong selective constraints (most
NALPs and endosomal Toll-like receptors (e.g., TLR3; 603029)), those
under weaker constraints (most NOD/IPAFs and cytosolic RIGI-like
receptors (e.g., DDX58; 609631)), and those that did not appear to
deviate from neutrality (most cell surface Toll-like receptors (e.g.,
TLR1; 601194)).

ANIMAL MODEL

Using chemical mutagenesis, Masters et al. (2012) generated mice with an
activating glu593-to-pro (Q593P) mutation in Nlrp1a. The mutation likely
occurred in a flex linker region of the protein between the NACHT and
LRR domains. Although grossly normal, mice homozygous for the Q593P
mutation had neutrophilic inflammatory disease in multiple organs. The
disease was dependent on Il1b and Casp1, but independent of Asc and
Casp11 (CASP4; 602664). Homozygous Q593P mice had elevated levels of
Il18. Histologic analysis showed that Q593P mice that also lacked Il18
had increased circulating neutrophils and mortality, which was
associated with increased myocarditis. In contrast, hepatitis was absent
in these mice, suggesting that IL18 is protective against myocarditis
but enhances liver inflammation. Hemopoietic stress induced in Q593P
mice by chemotherapy or lymphocytic choriomeningitis infection caused
prolonged cytopenia, bone marrow hyperplasia, and immunosuppression.
Mice lacking Nlrp1a showed enhanced recovery from these stresses,
indicating that NLRP1 acts as a cellular sentinel to alert CASP1 to
hemopoietic stress and infection.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
VITILIGO-ASSOCIATED MULTIPLE AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE SUSCEPTIBILITY 1
NLRP1, LEU155HIS

In a study of families with vitiligo-associated multiple autoimmune
disease (VAMAS1; 606579), Jin et al. (2007) identified association of a
nonsynonymous change in the coding region of the NALP1 gene, leu155 to
his (L155H; dbSNP rs12150220), with susceptibility both to vitiligo
alone and to autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases. The L155H
substitution occurs between the N-terminal pyrin and NACHT domains of
the NALP1 polypeptide, within a region highly conserved through primate
evolution. An association was also identified with another SNP in the
promoter region.

.0002
CORNEAL INTRAEPITHELIAL DYSKERATOSIS AND ECTODERMAL DYSPLASIA (1 family)
NLRP1, MET77THR

In an affected mother and son from a Caucasian French family segregating
autosomal dominant corneal intraepithelial dyskeratosis and ectodermal
dysplasia (CIDED; 615225), Soler et al. (2013) identified heterozygosity
for a c.230T-C transition in exon 1 of the NRLP1 gene, resulting in a
met77-to-thr (M77T) substitution at a conserved residue at the end of
the fourth alpha helix, predicted to destabilize the protein structure.
The mutation was not present in the unaffected maternal grandparents,
and was not found in 672 controls or in 61 exome-sequenced subjects'
DNA.

600188	TITLE *600188 AMINO-TERMINAL ENHANCER OF SPLIT; AES
;;GROUCHO-RELATED GENE 5; GRG5
DESCRIPTION In Drosophila melanogaster, neurogenesis is under the control of several
loci whose products appear to determine the fate of neuroectodermal
cells during embryonic development. One of these neurogenic loci is the
enhancer of split gene complex. Hartley et al. (1988) serendipitously
isolated a mouse cDNA which predicted a sequence of 202 amino acids
exhibiting strong similarity with the amino-terminal region of
Drosophila enhancer of split groucho protein. Miyasaka et al. (1993)
reported the cDNA cloning, nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequencing,
and tissue-specific expression of mouse and human AES (amino-terminal
enhancer of split) and ESG (enhancer of split groucho) genes. (ESG is
also called TLE for 'transducin-like enhancer of split.') Human AES
transcripts of 1.6 kb and 1.4 kb were predominantly present in muscle,
heart, and placenta.

Using human/Chinese hamster hybrid cell lines, Miyasaka et al. (1993)
mapped the human AES gene to chromosome 19. Hou and Li (1998) used
fluorescence in situ hybridization to localize the AES gene to 19p13.3
near the transcription factor-3 (TCF3; 141741) gene. They also
determined the nucleotide sequence for approximately 12 kb from the AES
gene and showed that its protein-encoding sequence is interrupted by 6
introns.

;;FRIZZLED, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, 3; FZD3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Wang et al. (1997) identified the FZD9 gene, which they called FZD3, by
applying CpG island cloning methods to cosmids from the deleted region
in patients with Williams syndrome (194050). Sequence comparisons
revealed that it encodes a 591-amino acid protein which is a novel
member of a 7-transmembrane domain receptor family (see 606143) whose
mammalian members are homologous to the Drosophila tissue polarity gene
'frizzled.' The FZD9 gene is expressed predominantly in brain, testis,
eye, skeletal muscle, and kidney. 'Frizzled' had been identified as the
receptor for the 'wingless' (wg) protein in Drosophila.

MAPPING

Wang et al. (1997) used dosage blotting of DNA from 11 Williams syndrome
probands to confirm that the FZD9 gene is located within the Williams
syndrome common deletion region at chromosome 7q11.23.

GENE FUNCTION

Wang et al. (1997) showed that Drosophila cells, as well as human cells,
when transfected with an FZD9 expression construct, bound the wg
protein. In mouse, the wg-homologous Wnt1 gene (164820) is involved in
early development of a large domain of the central nervous system
encompassing much of the midbrain and rostral metencephalon. The
potential function of FZD9 in transmitting a Wnt protein signal in the
human brain and other tissues suggested to Wang et al. (1997) that
heterozygous deletion of the FZD9 gene could contribute to the Williams
syndrome phenotype.

ANIMAL MODEL

Zhao et al. (2005) found that Fzd9-null mice had large increases in
apoptotic cell death in the developing hippocampal dentate gyrus. Cell
death commenced with the onset of dentate gyrus development and
persisted into the first postnatal week of life. Heterozygous mice were
intermediate between the wildtype and null mice for all developmental
neuroanatomic defects. All mice with a mutant allele had a decreased
seizure threshold, and Fzd9-null mice had severe deficits on tests of
visuospatial learning and memory. Zhao et al. (2005) concluded that FZD9
is critical for hippocampal development and is likely to be a
contributing factor to the neurodevelopmental and behavioral phenotype
of patients with Williams syndrome.

611052	TITLE *611052 SET DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1A; SETD1A
;;SET1A;;
SET1;;
KIAA0339
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SET1A is a component of a histone methyltransferase (HMT) complex that
produces mono-, di-, and trimethylated histone H3 at Lys4. The complex
is the analog of the S. cerevisiae Set1/COMPASS complex (Lee and
Skalnik, 2005). Also see SET1B (611055).

CLONING

Wysocka et al. (2003) purified proteins associated with HCF1 (300019)
and identified a previously uncharacterized human trithorax
(159555)-related SET1/ASH2 (604782) histone methyltransferase complex
that included SET1A, the human homolog of S. cerevisiae Set1. The SET1A
protein contains 1,709 amino acids and, like yeast Set1, contains highly
conserved SET and post-SET domains at the C terminus that are related to
those of the human and Drosophila trithorax protein, as well as an
N-terminal region with similarity to the RRM RNA recognition motif found
in many RNA-binding proteins. Consistent with the presence of HCF1 in
animals but not yeast, the human and C. elegans, but not the yeast, Set1
proteins contain an HCF1-binding motif found in HCF1 Kelch
domain-binding proteins such as the transcriptional activator VP16.

GENE FUNCTION

Wysocka et al. (2003) showed that, as in yeast, the HCF1-associated
human SET1/ASH2 HMT complex possesses histone H3-K4 methylation
activity, which activates transcription. Furthermore, this activity is
blocked by premethylation of K9, a repressor of transcription,
indicating that there is crosstalk between K9 methylation and K4
methylation by the SET1/ASH2 complex. The human SET1/ASH2 HMT complex
associates with the HCF1 Kelch domain, whereas Sin3 histone deacetylase
(HDAC) (see 607776 and 601241), a chromatin-associated complex which
represses transcription, associates with the basic region. From
subsequent cosedimentation and immunoprecipitation experiments, Wysocka
et al. (2003) found that the human SET1/ASH2 complex, in mutually
exclusive interactions, can associate with HCF1 bound to Sin3 HDAC or to
HCF1 bound to VP16, indicating a diversity of transcriptional regulatory
roles.

Lee and Skalnik (2005) determined that SET1A associates with an
approximately 450-kD complex that contains 5 noncatalytic components
including ASH2, CXXC1 (609150), RBBP5 (600697), WDR5 (609012), and WDR82
(611059). By confocal microscopy, they demonstrated that SET1A and CXXC1
colocalize to nuclear speckles associated with euchromatin.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1997) mapped the SETD1A
gene, which they designated KIAA0339, to chromosome 16. Scott (2007)
mapped the gene to 16p11.2 based on an alignment of the SETD1A sequence
(GenBank GENBANK AB002337) with the genomic sequence (build 36.2).

;;GAP JUNCTION PROTEIN, 32-KD;;
CONNEXIN 32; CX32;;
LIVER CONNEXIN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Connexins are membrane-spanning proteins that assemble to form gap
junction channels that facilitate the transfer of ions and small
molecules between cells (Bergoffen et al., 1993). For a general
discussion of connexin proteins, see GJB2 (121011).

CLONING

Kumar and Gilula (1986) isolated the human CX32 gene from a human liver
cDNA library. By Northern blot analysis, Bergoffen et al. (1993) showed
CX32 expression in liver and peripheral nerve.

Sohl et al. (2003) stated that mouse and human CX32 share 99% amino acid
identity and differ at only 4 residues. They also share significant
similarity in the 5-prime UTR and promoter region. Northern blot
analysis detected a 1.6-kb CX32 transcript in both mouse and human. In
both species, expression was highest in liver and moderate in pancreas,
kidney, and brain. No expression was detected in skeletal muscle, lung,
and heart.

MAPPING

Willecke et al. (1990) used a rat cDNA probe in Southern analysis of a
panel of human-mouse somatic cell hybrids to map CX32 to Xp11-q13.
Through analysis of somatic cell hybrids by PCR and hybridization,
Fishman et al. (1991) assigned the GJA1 gene (121014) to chromosome 6
and the GJB1 gene to Xp11-q22. Structural comparisons of these genes
indicated that they probably arose from a common progenitor gene.
Because of a critical function, the connexins may have evolved early and
have remained relatively conserved despite their disparate locations.

Using a series of somatic cell hybrid mapping panels and a rat GJB1
probe, Corcos et al. (1992) mapped the CX32 gene to proximal Xq13.1, in
interval 8, as described by Lafreniere et al. (1991). By somatic cell
hybrids, Hsieh et al. (1991) mapped GJB1 to Xcen-q22 and mapped the
corresponding gene to the X chromosome in the mouse. Raimondi et al.
(1992) refined the assignment to Xq13 by in situ hybridization.

GENE FUNCTION

Bergoffen et al. (1993) found CX32 expression in myelinated peripheral
nerve at the nodes of Ranvier and Schmidt-Lanterman incisures. CX32 may
form intracellular gap junctions that connect to the folds of Schwann
cell cytoplasm, allowing the transfer of nutrients, ions, and molecules
to the innermost myelin layers.

Scherer et al. (1995) demonstrated that CX32 is normally found in the
paranodal myelin loops and Schmidt-Lanterman incisures of myelinating
Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system, as well as in
oligodendrocytes and their processes, but not in compact myelin of the
central nervous system.

Kumar and Gilula (1996) gave a general review of the gap junction
communication channel. Beta-1 connexin is widely expressed in many
tissues, including liver.

Bondurand et al. (2001) showed that the transcription modulator SOX10
(602229), in synergy with EGR2 (129010), strongly activates CX32
expression in vitro by directly binding to its promoter. In agreement
with this finding, SOX10 and EGR2 mutants identified in patients with
peripheral myelin defects failed to transactivate the CX32 promoter.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

By direct sequencing, Bergoffen et al. (1993) identified 7 different
mutations in the CX32 gene (see, e.g., 304040.0001-304040.0003) in
affected persons from 8 families with X-linked dominant
Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMTX1; 302800).

Bone et al. (1995) described sequence analysis from 19 unrelated
patients with X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, detecting 6 novel
mutations and 3 previously reported mutations (see, e.g.,
304040.0003-304040.0011). Analysis of the distribution of these
mutations as well as those previously reported suggested to the authors
that virtually all regions of connexin 32 are important in its function.

Ionasescu et al. (1996) studied 27 families with X-linked
Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy. Mutations in the coding region of the
CX32 gene were found in 22 families. These mutations included 4 nonsense
mutations, 8 missense mutations, 2 medium-sized deletions, and 1
insertion. Most missense mutations showed a mild clinical phenotype (5
of 8), whereas all nonsense mutations, the larger of the 2 deletions,
and the insertion that produced frameshifts showed severe phenotypes. No
point mutations in the CX32 gene coding region were found in 5 CMTX1
families with mild clinical phenotype. In 3 of these families, positive
genetic linkage with the markers of the Xq13.1 region were found; the
genetic linkage of the remaining 2 families could not be evaluated
because of their small size.

Omori et al. (1996) studied 4 known mutations in the connexin-32 gene:
lys60 to phe, a mutation in a highly conserved cysteine residue; val139
to met (304040.0003), located in the transmembrane region; arg215 to
trp, located in the cytoplasmic tail; and ala220 to ter (304040.0005),
also located in the cytoplasmic tail. Since HeLa cells do not show
detectable levels of gap junction intercellular communication (GJIC) or
expression of any connexins, they tested the functional effects of
transfecting mutant genes in HeLa cultures. The first 3 mutations were
unable to restore GJIC in transfected HeLa cells (although their gene
products were detectable), in contrast to normal GJIC detected with the
last mutation. In addition, the dominant-negative effect was tested in
doubly transfected HeLa cells and the investigators found that low
expression of the mutant CX32 gene had a relatively significant effect
on diminishing GJIC. Omori et al. (1996) therefore concluded that
certain mutants form nonfunctional chimeric connexins with wildtype
connexins.

Nelis et al. (1997) described 5 new mutations in the CX32 gene. Janssen
et al. (1997) performed SSCP analysis of the CX32 gene in 121 patients
selected from the larger group of 443 patients on the basis of linkage
to Xq13.1, absence of the 17p12 duplication or deletion, and absence of
point mutations in PMP22 and P0. They found 5 new mutations and 3
mutations previously described in other unrelated families.

In 35 unrelated CMTX patients without the 17p11.2 duplication but with
median nerve conduction between 30 and 40 m/s, Rouger et al. (1997)
screened for a CX32 mutation. A total of 14 mutations were found, 5 of
which had not previously been reported. All but 1 of the mutations were
detected by SSCP. Mutations causing CMTX have been found mostly in exon
2 of the gene.

Latour et al. (1997) identified a total of 19 separate mutations in the
CX32 gene as the cause of CMTX in 21 French families.

Ainsworth et al. (1998) reported a family in which affected members with
CMTX had complete deletion of the GJB1 gene with complete absence of the
Cx32 gene product. The clinical phenotype in the affected individuals in
this kindred did not appear to differ greatly from the phenotype
observed in other individuals with missense, nonsense, or frameshift
mutations in the gene. This would appear to make a dominant-negative
effect of the mutation unlikely.

Ikegami et al. (1998) stated that more than 130 different mutations of
the GJB1 gene, including coding and noncoding regions, had been reported
in patients with X-linked CMT. In studies of 49 Japanese families with
CMT1 they found 5 mutations of the GJB1 gene; 4 of which had not
previously been reported.

Nelis et al. (1999) identified 163 distinct mutations in the coding
region of the CX32 gene in 268 unrelated patients with hereditary
peripheral neuropathy. Of these mutations, 125 were missense mutations,
1 a double missense mutation, 1 a missense mutation combined with a
1-amino acid deletion, 12 nonsense mutations, 17 frameshift mutations,
and 6 in-frame deletions and insertions. Further, in 1 case a complex
rearrangement in the coding region of CX32 was found. Most missense
mutations showed a mild clinical phenotype, whereas all nonsense
mutations and frameshift deletion/insertions showed severe phenotypes.
Forty-four percent of the codons were mutated in more than 1 patient. At
codon 22, 4 distinct mutations were identified in 20 unrelated patients.
In 2 X-linked families not showing mutations in the coding region of
CX32, mutations in the noncoding region were identified by Ionasescu et
al. (1996). In addition to the 163 mutations tabulated for the CX32 gene
in patients with hereditary peripheral neuropathy, Nelis et al. (1999)
identified 58 mutations in the MPZ gene (159440) and 27 mutations in the
PMP22 gene (601097).

GJB1 is expressed in both the peripheral and the central nervous system.
In consequence, it is not surprising that patients with CMTX1 and
specific GJB1 mutations have both peripheral neuropathy and a mild or
transient brain disorder (Paulson et al., 2002; Hanemann et al., 2003;
Takashima et al., 2003).

Kleopa et al. (2006) reported 2 novel mutations in the GJB1 gene that
segregated with CMTX1 in 2 unrelated families. In vitro expression
studies and immunohistochemistry showed that the mutant proteins were
retained within the Golgi apparatus and failed to reach the cell
membrane where gap junctions are normally formed.

Casasnovas et al. (2006) identified 34 GJB1 mutations, including 6 novel
mutations, in 59 patients from 34 CMT families of Spanish or Portuguese
descent. The extracellular loop domains were affected in 64.6% of
mutations.

In a family with X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (302800), Bone et
al. (1995) found a deletion of thymidine residue in codon 137 of CX32,
resulting in a frameshift mutation which predicted a truncated 194-amino
acid protein with the last 58 amino acids starting at codon 137 altered
from wildtype.

.0011

resulting in the substitution of methionine for valine.

Montenegro et al. (2011) reported the use of exome sequencing to
identify the V95M mutation in affected members of a large family with
Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and a questionable inheritance pattern.
Affected individuals had classic features of the disease, with onset
between ages 14 and 40 years of distal sensory impairment and muscle
weakness and atrophy affecting the upper and lower limbs. Nerve
conduction velocities were in the intermediate range.

.0012
CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, X-LINKED DOMINANT, 1
GJB1, ASN205SER

Since CX32 is expressed not only in Schwann cells in the peripheral
nervous system but also in oligodendrocytes in the central nervous
system, Bahr et al. (1999) examined a CMTX1 (302800) family for evidence
of CNS involvement. The family had an asn205-to-ser mutation involving
the fourth transmembrane domain of CX32. The patients showed typical
clinical and electrophysiologic abnormalities in the peripheral nervous
system, but, in addition, visual, acoustic, and motor pathways of the
CNS were affected subclinically. This was indicated by pathologic
changes in visual evoked potentials, brainstem auditory evoked
potentials, and central motor evoked potentials. They suggested that
abnormal electrophysiologic findings in CNS pathway examinations should
raise the suspicion of CMTX and a search for mutations in the GJB1 gene.

.0013
CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, X-LINKED DOMINANT, 1
GJB1, 367G-T

In a 71-year-old woman with X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease
(302800), Tabaraud et al. (1999) identified a truncating mutation, GAG
to TAG at nucleotide 367, in the GJB1 gene. The mutation led to
termination by a glutamic acid in codon position 102 instead of codon
283 for the normal protein.

.0014
CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, X-LINKED DOMINANT, 1
GJB1, SER85CYS

Janssen et al. (1997) identified a C-to-G transversion in the GJB1 gene,
resulting in a ser85-to-cys (S85C) substitution, associated with
X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (302800).

Abrams et al. (2002) showed that expression of the S85C mutation
resulted in large, relatively nonselective, voltage-dependent currents
not seen in oocytes expressing wildtype Cx32. The findings suggested
that the S85C mutant has a much greater propensity to form conducting
hemichannels than does wildtype Cx32. The authors suggested that the
resulting increase in membrane permeability may prevent normal
functioning of the Schwann cells and peripheral nerves of patients
harboring this mutation.

.0015
CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, X-LINKED DOMINANT, 1
GJB1, -528T-G

Ionasescu et al. (1996) described a family with X-linked CMT (302800)
that harbored a T-to-G transversion at position -528 with respect to the
ATG start codon. Bondurand et al. (2001) used gelshift experiments to
show that the mutation impaired the binding of SOX10 (602229) to the
CX32 promoter region.

.0016
CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, X-LINKED DOMINANT, 1
GJB1, THR55ILE

In 2 sibs with X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (302800), Panas et
al. (2001) identified a C-to-T transition at position 164 in exon 2 of
the GJB1 gene, resulting in a thr55-to-ile (T55I) substitution. In
addition to extremity weakness and atrophy and polyneuropathy, the
patients had episodes of severe weakness lasting from hours to days,
dysarthria, dysphagia, and bilateral hyperintensities of the
periventricular white matter on MRI. Panas et al. (2001) noted that
connexin-32 is expressed in Schwann cells, oligodendrocytes, and some
neuronal populations, which may explain the CNS involvement.

.0017
CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, X-LINKED DOMINANT, 1
GJB1, 21-BP DUP

In a patient with X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (302800),
Kawakami et al. (2002) identified a 21-bp duplication from residues 55
to 61 in exon 2 of the GJB1 gene, resulting in a 7-amino acid insertion
in the first extracellular loop of the protein. The patient showed
clinical cerebellar abnormalities with a normal MRI and prolonged
central somatosensory conduction times. His clinically asymptomatic
mother carried the mutation. The authors referred to the report by Panas
et al. (2001) (see 304040.0016), and suggested that mutation in this
area of the GJB1 gene, specifically residue 55, may lead to CNS
manifestations.

.0018
CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, X-LINKED DOMINANT, 1
GJB1, 3-BP DEL, 304GAG

Hanemann et al. (2003) reported a family in which 3 members were
affected with X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (302800). Direct
sequencing of the GJB1 gene in 2 living patients identified a 3-bp
deletion (304delGAG), resulting in deletion of a glutamic acid at codon
102 (glu102). In addition to classic CMT clinical findings, all 3
patients had transient CNS symptoms correlating with transient and
reversible white matter lesions on MRI. CNS symptoms included
paraparesis, monoparesis, tetraparesis, dysarthria, aphasia, and cranial
nerve palsies.

.0019
CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, X-LINKED DOMINANT, 1
GJB1, -526G-C

In affected members of a large family with X-linked CMT (302800),
Houlden et al. (2004) identified a -526G-C transversion in a highly
conserved region of the nerve-specific P2 promoter of the GJB1 gene. The
mutation occurs within a SOX10 (602229) S2 binding site, similar to the
-528T-G mutation (304040.0015). Functional expression studies showed
that the -526G-C mutation impaired SOX10 binding, resulting in a 65%
decrease in transcriptional activation.

.0020
CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, X-LINKED DOMINANT, 1
GJB1, PHE235CYS

In a girl with a severe early-onset form of X-linked CMT (302800), Liang
et al. (2005) identified a 766T-G transversion in the GJB1 gene,
resulting in a phe235-to-cys (F235C) substitution in the carboxy tail
domain of the protein. The mutation was not identified in 50 control
chromosomes. The patient's asymptomatic mother also carried the
mutation, but Southern blot analysis showed preferential inactivation of
the mutant X-chromosome by a ratio of approximately 9 to 1. Functional
expression studies demonstrated that cells with the F235C mutant protein
had normal plasma membrane expression of the channel protein, but showed
a reduction of the resting membrane potential of more than 40 mV, with a
decrease in the threshold of activation. Cells expressing the mutant
protein also showed decreased viability compared to wildtype. Liang et
al. (2005) concluded that the propensity of the F235C hemichannels to be
open at resting membrane potential ('leaky channel') adversely affected
cell viability, thus resulting in a severe phenotype. Similar in vitro
findings had been reported for another GJB1 mutation (S85C;
304040.0014).

.0021
CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, X-LINKED DOMINANT, 1
DEJERINE-SOTTAS NEUROPATHY, INCLUDED
GJB1, VAL136ALA

In Korean patients with X-linked CMT (302800), Choi et al. (2004)
identified a 407T-C transition in the GJB1 gene, resulting in a
val136-to-ala (V136A) substitution. (In the original publication, Choi
et al. (2004) erroneously designated the nucleotide change as 408T-C.)

In a Korean girl with Dejerine-Sottas syndrome (145900), Chung et al.
(2005) identified 2 mutations in 2 different genes: the V136A
substitution in the GJB1 gene and an R359W mutation in the EGR2 gene
(129010.0004). She inherited the EGR2 mutation from her father, who had
Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease-1D (607678). The GJB1 gene was de novo. The
father had pes cavus and developed difficulty walking at age 8 years,
but had a milder phenotype than the daughter, who had experienced gait
difficulties since infancy and facial weakness. She also had bilateral
hand muscle weakness and atrophy and had sensory impairment of both
upper and lower extremities. Chung et al. (2005) concluded that the more
severe phenotype in the daughter was caused by an additive effect of the
2 mutations.

186982	TITLE *186982 T-COMPLEX HOMOLOG TCP11; TCP11
DESCRIPTION The mouse tcp11 gene is located in the distal inversion of the t-complex
and is developmentally regulated in the same manner as the zinc finger
gene ZNF76 (194549). The 2 genes are expressed in the testis at the same
time. Ragoussis et al. (1992) isolated the human homolog of tcp11. By
use of a combination of somatic cell hybrids, radiation hybrids,
metaphase and interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization, and pulsed
field gel electrophoresis, they mapped the ZNF76 and TCP11 genes to the
6p21.3-p21.2 region and linked them to each other within 300 kb of DNA,
approximately 2 Mb centromeric to the major histocompatibility complex.
(The D number assigned to the human homolog of tcp11 was D6S230E.)

120240	TITLE *120240 COLLAGEN, TYPE VI, ALPHA-2; COL6A2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The COL6A2 gene encodes the alpha-2 subunit of type VI collagen, an
ubiquitously expressed extracellular matrix protein. It is 1 of the 3
subunits comprising the full collagen VI protein (see also COL6A1,
120220 and COL6A3, 120250) (summary by Zhang et al., 2010).

CLONING

Weil et al. (1988) isolated clones corresponding to the COL6A2 gene from
a human placenta expression library. Northern blot analysis detected a
3.5-kb mRNA transcript. The molecular mass of the protein is
approximately 140 kD.

Chu et al. (1989) determined that the COL6A2 protein contains 998 amino
acids with 31% identity to COL6A1 in the N-terminal and C-terminal
globular domains, which are connected by a triple helical segment. Both
COL6A1 and COL6A2 contain small signal peptide sequences. Internal
alignment of the globular sequences showed a repetitive 200-residue
structure (15 to 23% identity) occurring 3 times (N1, C1, C2) in each
chain. Sequencing of COL6A2 cDNA clones revealed 2 variant chains with a
distinct C2 subdomain and 3-prime noncoding region. The repetitive
segments C1, C2 and, to a lesser extent, N1 showed significant identity
(15 to 18%) to the collagen-binding A domains of von Willebrand factor
(VWF; 613160). These results suggested that the globular domains of the
COL6 proteins bind to collagenous structures.

Saitta et al. (1992) found that the human COL6A2 gene uses alternative
processing to produce multiple mRNA transcripts differing in the 5-prime
untranslated region as well as in the 3-prime coding and noncoding
sequences.

GENE STRUCTURE

Saitta et al. (1992) demonstrated that the COL6A2 gene contains 30 exons
and spans 36 kb.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid and FISH analysis, Weil et al. (1988) mapped the
COL6A2 gene to chromosome 21q22.3.

GENE FUNCTION

Klewer et al. (1998) studied COL6A2 gene expression in the developing
mammalian heart. The pattern of expression was identical to that of
COL6A1.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 9 kindreds with the Bethlem form of autosomal dominant myopathy with
contractures (158810), Jobsis et al. (1996) demonstrated genetic linkage
to the COL6A1-COL6A2 cluster on 21q22.3. By sequence analysis in 4
families, Jobsis et al. (1996) identified a mutation in COL6A1 in 1
kindred and a mutation in COL6A2 in 2 others. Both mutations disrupted
the Gly-X-Y motif of the triple helical domain by substitution of gly
for either val or ser. Analogous to the putative perturbation of the
anchoring function of the dystrophin-associated complex in congenital
muscular dystrophy with mutations in the alpha-2-subunit of laminin
(156225), the observation suggested a similar mechanism in Bethlem
myopathy.

Ullrich scleroatonic muscular dystrophy, also known as Ullrich
congenital muscular dystrophy (UCMD; 254090), shares some clinical
features with Bethlem myopathy, such as joint contractures, but displays
a more severe course. Vanegas et al. (2001) demonstrated recessive
mutations in the COL6A2 gene (see 120240.0002) leading to UCMD.

Lampe et al. (2005) developed a method for rapid direct sequence
analysis of all 107 coding exons of the COL6 genes (COL6A1, COL6A2,
COL6A3; 120250) using single condition amplification/internal primer
(SCAIP) sequencing. They sequenced all 3 COL6 genes from genomic DNA in
79 patients with UCMD or Bethlem myopathy, and found putative mutations
in 1 of the COL6 genes in 62% of patients. Some patients showed changes
in more than one of the COL6 genes, and some UCMD patients appeared to
have dominant rather than recessive disease. Lampe et al. (2005)
concluded that these findings may explain some or all of the cases of
UCMD that are unlinked to the COL6 gene under a recessive model.

In 2 unrelated patients with Bethlem myopathy, Baker et al. (2007)
identified 2 different heterozygous mutations in the COL6A2 gene
(120240.0009; 120240.0010). In vitro studies indicated defective
collagen VI synthesis and secretion.

In 2 sibs with autosomal recessive myosclerosis (255600), Merlini et al.
(2008) identified a homozygous truncating mutation in the COL6A2 gene
(120240.0011).

Nadeau et al. (2009) identified a homozygous COL6A2 mutation (C777R;
120240.0012) in 3 patients with autosomal recessive UCMD. Two additional
patients had 2 different heterozygous COL6A2 mutations (see, e.g.,
G283R, 120240.0013), consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance.
Another patient was compound heterozygous for a mutation in the COL6A1
gene (G281R; 120220.0014) and a mutation in the COL6A2 gene (R498H;
120240.0014), consistent with digenic inheritance.

- Role of COL6A2 in Atrioventricular Septal Defect

Ackerman et al. (2012) used a candidate gene approach among individuals
with Down syndrome and complete atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD)
(141 cases) and Down syndrome with no congenital heart defect (141
controls) to determine whether rare genetic variants in genes involved
in atrioventricular valvuloseptal morphogenesis contribute to AVSD in
this sensitized population. Ackerman et al. (2012) found a significant
excess (p less than 0.0001) of variants predicted to be deleterious in
cases compared to controls. At the most stringent level of filtering,
they found potentially damaging variants in nearly 20% of cases but in
fewer than 3% of controls. The variants with the highest probability of
being damaging in cases only were found in 6 genes: COL6A1, COL6A2,
CRELD1 (607170) (already identified as a cause of AVSD; see 606217),
FBLN2 (135821), FRZB (605083), and GATA5 (611496). Several of the
case-specific variants were recurrent in unrelated individuals,
occurring in 10% of cases studied. No variants with an equal probability
of being damaging were found in controls, demonstrating a highly
specific association with AVSD. Of note, all of these genes are in the
VEGFA (192240) pathway, suggesting to Ackerman et al. (2012) that rare
variants in this pathway might contribute to the genetic underpinnings
of AVSD in humans.

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

Gualandi et al. (2009) reported 2 unrelated patients with Bethlem
myopathy who were each compound heterozygous for a truncating and a
missense mutation in the COL6A2 gene (Q819X, 120240.0011 and
R830Q/R843W, 120240.0017; R366X, 120240.0018 and D871N; 120240.0019,
respectively). Both patients remained ambulatory as adults, and muscle
biopsies and studies of fibroblasts showed variable degrees of aberrant
collagen VI microfilament formation. Gualandi et al. (2009) noted that
autosomal recessive inheritance had not been reported in Bethlem
myopathy and suggested that collagen VI-related myopathies comprise a
spectrum of conditions with variable severity. In addition, the findings
did not support pure haploinsufficiency as a causative mechanism for
Bethlem myopathy, and suggested that some previously reported patients
may harbor a second missed mutation. The genotype findings in these
patients had important implications for genetic counseling.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
BETHLEM MYOPATHY
COL6A2, GLY250SER

In 2 kindreds with Bethlem myopathy (158810), Jobsis et al. (1996)
demonstrated that affected members had a heterozygous missense mutation
(898G-A) resulting in a G250S amino acid substitution in the triple
helical region.

.0002
ULLRICH CONGENITAL MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
COL6A2, 1-BP INS, 1151C

In an Italian family, Vanegas et al. (2001) found that a son with
Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy (254090) had a homozygous
insertion of a C leading to a premature termination codon in the triple
helical domain of COL6A2 mRNA. Both healthy consanguineous parents were
carriers. The insertion of the C was in a stretch of 5 cytosines between
nucleotides 1147 and 1151 of the COL6A2 cDNA, causing a slippage of the
reading frame with a premature termination codon at nucleotides
1347-1349. The affected patient in this family showed reduced fetal
movements. At birth he was unusually long (55 cm), showed multiple joint
contractures of his knees and elbows, a kyphotic contracture of the
spine, a left hip dislocation, bilateral congenital convex pes valgus,
long and slender fingers and toes with adducted thumbs, ogival palate,
micrognathia, and a short neck with torticollis. He also showed marked
bilateral distal hyperlaxity of fingers, toes, calcanei, and wrists. The
child walked at the age of 13 months, but generalized muscle weakness
persisted thereafter, and progressive scoliosis and respiratory failure
developed. He underwent tracheostomy and nocturnal positive pressure
mechanical ventilation at the age of 8 years, with signs of
diaphragmatic insufficiency. At the age of 11 years, he was still
ambulant and had normal intelligence.

In fibroblasts from the patient reported by Vanegas et al. (2001), Zhang
et al. (2002) showed almost complete absence of COL6A2 mRNA by Northern
blot analysis, suggesting that the mutation led to nonsense-mediated
mRNA decay. There was complete absence of secreted COL6A2 protein in the
medium of the patient's cells, suggesting that the mutation in the
triple helical domain prevented microfibrillar assembly and secretion.
Although both parents showed decreased levels of COL6A2 mRNA, long-term
collagen VI deposition was essentially normal.

.0003
ULLRICH CONGENITAL MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
COL6A2, IVS17, A-G, -2

In an Italian family, Vanegas et al. (2001) found that 2 brothers with
Ullrich scleroatonic muscular dystrophy (254090) had a splice acceptor
site mutation in the COL6A2 gene. Deletion of 28 nucleotides was caused
by an A-to-G substitution at nucleotide -2 of intron 17, causing
activation of a cryptic acceptor site within exon 18. The normal parents
were unrelated. Severe contractures of elbows and knees, rigidity of the
spine, ogival (gothic) palate, and hypotonia were present. In 1 brother
there was distal hyperlaxity and marked weakness of head flexors but
almost complete disappearance of limb joint contractures at the age of 2
years. In the brothers, this mutation was found in compound
heterozygosity with a splice site mutation in intron 23 (120240.0004).
The first mutation was present in the healthy mother, whereas the second
mutation was carried by the healthy father. In another Italian family,
Vanegas et al. (2001) found the same 28-bp deletion but did not find the
mutation in the other allele. This mutation occurred de novo in the
patient.

In fibroblasts from 1 of the patients reported by Vanegas et al. (2001)
who was a compound heterozygote for mutations in the COL6A2 gene, Zhang
et al. (2002) showed decreased levels of COL6A2 mRNA by Northern blot
analysis, suggesting that the mutations led to nonsense-mediated mRNA
decay. Low levels of COL6A2 protein were detected in the medium of the
patient's cells, suggesting that the mutations, which occurred at the
distal part of the triple helical domain, allowed secretion of a small
amount of mutant collagen VI protein. Further analysis showed that the
truncated proteins were able to form triple helical monomers, but unable
to assemble into dimers and tetramers for the completed collagen VI
protein. Zhang et al. (2002) noted that the IVS23 mutation (120240.0004)
retains the triple helical domain and thus can assemble into monomers,
but has a shorter C-terminal globular domain which prevents further
assembly into higher ordered structures. Although both parents showed
decreased levels of COL6A2 mRNA, long-term collagen VI deposition was
essentially normal.

.0004
ULLRICH CONGENITAL MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
COL6A2, IVS23, G-A, -1

Vanegas et al. (2001) described 2 brothers with Ullrich scleroatonic
muscular dystrophy (254090) who were compound heterozygotes for 2 splice
site mutations in the COL6A2 gene, one in intron 17 (120240.0003) and
the other a G-to-A substitution at nucleotide -1 in intron 23.

.0005
BETHLEM MYOPATHY
COL6A2, ASP620ASN

In a Caucasian family from Mississippi and North Carolina, Scacheri et
al. (2002) found 9 members with an autosomal dominant limb-girdle
muscular dystrophy phenotype. A causative missense mutation, asp620 to
asn (D620N), was present in heterozygous state. This mutation did not
overtly affect the expression of proteins of the extracellular matrix
(ECM), but did alter the expression of laminin beta-1 (150240) in the
basement membrane of muscle fibers. Type VI collagen was thought to
anchor the basal lamina to the extracellular matrix by interacting with
collagen type IV, which in turn was thought to bind laminin beta-1 (Kuo
et al., 1997). Scacheri et al. (2002) suggested that their studies widen
the clinical spectrum of Bethlem myopathy (158810) and indicated that
autosomal dominant limb-girdle muscular dystrophy should be studied for
possible collagen VI etiology.

.0006
ULLRICH CONGENITAL MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
COL6A2, 26-BP DEL, NT731

In a patient with Ullrich disease (254090), Higuchi et al. (2001)
identified a homozygous 26-bp deletion (nucleotides 731-756) in exon 14
of the COL6A2 gene, causing a frameshift and premature termination
codon, and resulting in a truncated collagen VI alpha-2 chain. Collagen
VI expression was absent from the patient's skeletal muscle and skin
samples.

.0007
ULLRICH CONGENITAL MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
COL6A2, IVS12AS, A-G, -10

In a patient with Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy (254090),
Lucarini et al. (2005) identified a homozygous A-to-G transition in
intron 12 of the COL6A2 gene, resulting in deletion of exon 13, which
removed 21 amino acids from the N terminus of the triple helical domain.
The misaligned N-terminal region was predicted to interfere with the
assembly of collagen VI microfibrils. The intron mutation activated
numerous cryptic acceptor sites, generating both normal and exon
13-deleted COL6A2 mRNA as well as multiple transcripts containing
frameshifts that were degraded through nonsense-mediated decay.

.0008
ULLRICH CONGENITAL MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
COL6A2, 1.3-KB DEL

In a patient with Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy (254090), Baker
et al. (2005) identified heterozygosity for a 1,332-bp deletion of the
COL6A2 gene, which included part of intron 5, all of exon 6 and intron
6, and part of exon 7 and was predicted to result in loss of 27 amino
acids in the triple helical region. The patient's mother was a mosaic
carrier of the deletion.

COL6A2, IVS10AS, A-G, -2

In a 40-year-old man with Bethlem myopathy (158810), Baker et al. (2007)
identified a heterozygous A-to-G transition in intron 10 of the COL6A2
gene, resulting in the skipping of exon 11. Exon 11 codes for the only
cysteine residue in the triple helical domain of the protein, which is
predicted to form a disulfide bond critical for dimerization. This would
result in decreased assembly of the collagen VI protein. Further
evidence indicated nonsense-mediated decay of an mRNA with a premature
stop codon, and reduced secretion of structurally abnormal collagen. The
patient had proximal muscle weakness, decreased motor capacity, joint
contractures, and dystrophic features on muscle biopsy.

BETHLEM MYOPATHY
COL6A2, PRO932LEU

In a 42-year-old Australian man with Bethlem myopathy (158810), Baker et
al. (2007) identified a heterozygous 2795C-T transition in exon 28 of
the COL6A2 gene, resulting in a pro932-to-leu (P932L) substitution in
the globular C2 A-domain. Three first cousins and a niece were affected
and also carried the mutation. The proband had proximal muscle weakness
and joint contractures. Further studies indicated that the mutant P932L
resulted in reduced intracellular collagen VI assembly and secretion.

COL6A2, GLN819TER

In 2 sibs, born of consanguineous parents, with autosomal recessive
myosclerosis (255600), Merlini et al. (2008) identified a homozygous
2537C-T transition in exon 27 in the COL6A2 gene, resulting in a
gln819-to-ter (Q819X) substitution in the C1 domain. RT-PCR studies
showed that the mutation did not result in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay;
the translated truncated protein lacked the C2 domain. Studies in
patient fibroblasts showed decreased COL6A2 transcripts and decreased
amounts of collagen VI deposited in the extracellular matrix. The
secreted collagen VI microfibrils were abnormally organized and did not
assemble properly into tetramers. The heterozygous parents were
unaffected, suggesting that the mutation is not pathogenic in the
heterozygous state.

Gualandi et al. (2009) identified compound heterozygosity for the Q819X
mutation and a complex missense allele (R830Q/R843W; 120240.0017) in a
25-year-old woman with Bethlem myopathy (158800). Although this genotype
suggested autosomal recessive inheritance, the R819X mutation escaped
nonsense-mediated decay and was thought not to be pathogenic in the
heterozygous state, based on the report of Merlini et al. (2008).
However, the fact that the woman reported by Gualandi et al. (2009)
carried COL6A2 mutations on both alleles had implications for genetic
counseling.

ULLRICH CONGENITAL MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
COL6A2, CYS777ARG

In 3 patients with UCMD (254090), including 2 cousins, Nadeau et al.
(2009) identified a homozygous 2329T-C transition in exon 26 of the
COL6A2 gene, resulting in a cys777-to-arg (C777R) substitution. Onset
ranged from birth to 2 years. One child had congenital hip dislocation.
All had proximal muscle weakness and learned to walk independently at
about 1 year of age, but became wheelchair-bound at ages 6.8, 9, and
11.5 years, respectively. Other features included spinal rigidity,
scoliosis, and kyphosis. All also required nocturnal ventilation, and 1
needed gastrostomy for chewing difficulties. Only 1 had follicular
hyperkeratosis.

ULLRICH CONGENITAL MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
COL6A2, GLY283ARG

In a 20-year-old patient with UCMD (254090), Nadeau et al. (2009)
identified a heterozygous 847G-A transition in exon 6 of the COL6A2
gene, resulting in a gly283-to-arg (G283R) substitution. The patient had
onset at birth with hypotonia, contractures, scoliosis, and delayed
motor development. Walking with support was achieved at age 3.3 years,
but the patient became wheelchair-bound at age 10. Nocturnal ventilation
was also required. Skin changes included follicular hyperkeratosis and
keloid formation.

ULLRICH CONGENITAL MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, DIGENIC, COL6A1/COL6A2
COL6A2, ARG498HIS

In a 25-year-old patient with UCMD (254090), Nadeau et al. (2009)
identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in 2 different genes:
a 1493G-A transition in exon 18 of the COL6A2 gene, resulting in an
arg498-to-his (R498H) substitution, and a substitution in the COL6A1
gene (G281R; 120220.0014). The findings were consistent with digenic
inheritance. The patient had onset at age 1.5 years of delayed motor
development with proximal muscle weakness. Independent walking was
achieved, but the patient became wheelchair-bound at age 19. Spinal
rigidity, scoliosis, and contractures were also present, as well as
follicular hyperkeratosis and a requirement for nocturnal ventilation.

ULLRICH CONGENITAL MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
COL6A2, GLU624LYS

In a Brazilian girl with Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy (254090),
Zhang et al. (2010) identified a homozygous 1870G-A transition in the
COL6A2 gene, resulting in a glu624-to-lys (E624K) substitution in the C1
globular subdomain. Sequence alignment and molecular modeling indicated
that the mutation occurred in a consensus metal ion-dependent adhesion
site (MIDAS). Patient fibroblasts deposited abundant collagen VI
microfibrils that were thick and abnormally knotty. HEK293 cells
transfected with the mutation assembled low levels of short collagen VI
microfibrils. The E624K mutation did not affect collagen VI formation
and assembly and did not exert a dominant-negative effect, as
heterozygous family members were unaffected. However, the E624K-mutant
chain was less efficient in supporting microfibrillar assembly than
wildtype.

.0016
ULLRICH CONGENITAL MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
COL6A2, ARG876SER

In a young man, born of consanguineous Filipino parents, with Ullrich
congenital muscular dystrophy (254090), Zhang et al. (2010) identified a
homozygous 2626C-A transversion in the COL6A2 gene, resulting in an
arg876-to-ser (R876S) substitution in the beta-2 strand of the C2
globular subdomain. Patient fibroblasts produced almost no collagen VI
microfibrils in the extracellular matrix. The minute amounts of COL6A2
that were produced consisted of the C2a splice variant with a shorter
alternative C2 subdomain not affected by the missense mutation. The C2a
splice variant COL6A2 was not assembled into a triple-helical collagen
VI molecule. HEK293 cells transfected with the R876S mutation showed
intracellular retention of the mutant chain and were unable to
synthesize normal collagen VI microfibrils. However, the patient showed
a slightly less severe phenotype than another affected patient with a
different mutation (see 120240.0015), suggesting that the low levels of
COL6A2 with alternatively spliced C2a may have functionally compensated
for loss of normal COL6A2.

BETHLEM MYOPATHY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
COL6A2, ARG830GLN AND ARG843TRP

In a 25-year-old woman with Bethlem myopathy (158810), Gualandi et al.
(2009) identified compound heterozygosity for variations in the COL6A2
gene. The maternal allele carried a 2571G-A and a 2609C-T transition,
both in exon 28, resulting in an arg830-t-gln (R830Q) and an
arg843-to-trp (R843W) substitution, respectively, in the C2 domain. Both
mutations affected highly conserved residues. The paternal allele
carried a Q819X (120240.0011) substitution. The patient had onset of
progressive proximal muscle weakness at age 2 years. During the course
of the disorder, she developed prominent joint contractures and
decreased forced vital capacity (65% of predicted), but retained
independent ambulation. Muscle biopsy showed a myopathic pattern and
fibrosis with mildly decreased collagen VI staining. Studies of
fibroblasts showed absence of collagen VI tetramer formation, but
electron microscopy showed correct filamentous and interconnected
collagen VI microfilaments. Gualandi et al. (2009) concluded that this
woman showed rare autosomal recessive inheritance of Bethlem myopathy
based on her genotype. However, the authors noted that the R819X
mutation escaped nonsense-mediated decay and was thought not to be
pathogenic in the heterozygous state, based on the report of Merlini et
al. (2008). The fact that the woman reported by Gualandi et al. (2009)
carried COL6A2 mutations on both alleles had implications for genetic
counseling.

BETHLEM MYOPATHY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
COL6A2, ARG366TER

In a 47-year-old man with Bethlem myopathy (158810), Gualandi et al.
(2009) identified compound heterozygous mutations in the COL6A2 gene: a
1178C-T transition in exon 12, resulting in an arg366-to-ter (R366X)
substitution, and a de novo 2693G-A transition in exon 28, resulting in
an asp871-to-asn (D871N; 120240.0019) substitution in a conserved region
of the C2 domain. The nonsense mutation was demonstrated to undergo
nonsense-mediated decay. The patient's unaffected mother carried the
heterozygous R377X mutation, suggesting that it is not pathogenic in the
heterozygous state. The patient was born with talipes equinovarus and
had Achilles contractures in childhood. He had limb-girdle weakness with
joint contractures and reduced vital capacity (64% of predicted). At age
47, he could walk with aid, but could no longer rise from the floor.
Muscle biopsy showed dystrophic features and decreased collagen VI.
Studies of fibroblasts showed severely decreased levels of all forms of
collagen VI, and electron microscopy showed irregular collagen VI
microfilaments with absence of normal network structure. Gualandi et al.
(2009) concluded that this patient had autosomal recessive Bethlem
myopathy because of the genotype and his ability to remain ambulatory.
The authors stated that the combination of a missense and a nonsense
mutation in the COL6A2 gene had not previously been reported, yielding
implications for genetic counseling.

ULLRICH CONGENITAL MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
COL6A2, 6-BP DEL, 1855

In a girl with UCMD (254090), Tooley et al. (2010) identified compound
heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the COL6A2 gene: a 6-bp deletion in
exon 25 (1855_1860del6) causing an in-frame deletion of 2 amino acids in
the N-terminal C1 VWA domain (V619_I620del2), and a G-to-T transversion
in intron 23 (1771-1G-T; 120240.0021), resulting in the skipping of exon
24, a frameshift, and premature termination. Each mutation was inherited
from an unaffected parent. Northern blot analysis of patient fibroblasts
showed that the intron 23 mutation resulted in nonsense-mediated mRNA
decay. Patient fibroblasts showed reduced, but present, collagen VI
production, indicating that the COL6A1 and COL6A3 chains could associate
with mutant COL6A2, forming monomers, dimers, and tetramers. However,
kinetic studies showed that the mutation delayed the assembly and
secretion of collagen VI compared to controls, and several additional
approaches showed that the mutation prevented the association of
secreted tetramers into collagen VI microfibrils. Recombinant C1 domains
containing the mutation were insoluble and retained intracellularly as
disulfide-bonded aggregates, consistent with misfolding. The findings
indicated that a correctly folded COL6A2 C1 domain is important for
microfibril assembly.

147572	TITLE *147572 INTERFERON-ALPHA-INDUCIBLE PROTEIN 6; IFI6
;;INTERFERON-INDUCED PROTEIN IFI-6-16; IFI616;;
G1P3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By differential screening of an alpha-interferon (IFNA; 147660)-induced
neuroblastoma cell cDNA library, followed by screening an IFNA-treated
Daudi lymphoblastoid cell cDNA library, Kelly et al. (1986) cloned IFI6,
which they called 6-16. The deduced 130-amino acid protein is
hydrophobic and contains an N-terminal signal peptide.

GENE FUNCTION

Kelly et al. (1986) showed that IFI6 was induced in HeLa cells by IFNA
and IFNB (147640). Following transfection in mouse cells, human IFI6 was
expressed in response to mouse Ifna and Ifnb, but not Ifng (147570),
with the same kinetics and dose response as in human cells.

Itzhaki and Porter (1991) reported a method for targeted disruption of
the IFI6 gene and detection by secretion of human growth hormone (GH1;
139250).

Cheriyath et al. (2007) showed that treatment of human myeloma cells
with IFN-alpha-2b (see IFNA2; 147562) for 24 hours antagonized TRAIL
(TNFSF10; 603598)-mediated apoptosis, but after 72 hours it augmented
TRAIL apoptotic activity. The antiapoptotic activity of IFN-alpha-2b was
associated with increased expression of G1P3. Ectopically expressed G1P3
localized to mitochondria and antagonized TRAIL-mediated mitochondrial
potential loss, cytochrome c release, and apoptosis. Conversely, RNA
interference-mediated downregulation of G1P3 restored
IFN-alpha-2b-induced apoptosis. Cheriyath et al. (2007) concluded that
curtailing G1P3-mediated antiapoptotic signals may improve therapies for
myeloma and other malignancies.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kelly et al. (1986) determined that the IFI6 gene contains 5 exons and
has a TATA box upstream of the transcription initiation site.

Porter et al. (1988) described the interferon response element of the
human IFI6 gene.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid analysis, Clauss et al. (1990) mapped the IFI6
gene to chromosome 1.

Itzhaki et al. (1992) reported that the IFI6 gene maps to chromosome
1p35, based on the work of others using fluorescence in situ
hybridization. Itzhaki et al. (1992) used telomere-associated chromosome
fragmentation (TACF), a novel approach for chromosome mapping based on
the nontargeted introduction of clone telomeres into mammalian
chromosomes, to target telomeric DNA to the IFI6 gene on chromosome 1p.
They deduced that the IFI6 gene is oriented away from the centromere by
targeting telomeric DNA to the specific locus by homologous
recombination, using a selection strategy that imposed the requirement
that the telomeric DNA be oriented in the same direction as the IFI6
gene.

611526	TITLE *611526 NOP14, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; NOP14
;;NUCLEOLAR PROTEIN 14; NOL14;;
RES4-25
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

NOP14 plays a role in the processing of the pre-18S rRNA and small
ribosomal subunit assembly (Liu and Thiele, 2001).

CLONING

By screening human brain cDNA libraries, followed by RT-PCR and database
analysis, Hadano et al. (1998) isolated a partial NOP14 cDNA, which they
called RES4-25. The deduced protein contains 718 amino acids. Northern
blot analysis of human tissues detected a 3.8-kb transcript with strong
expression in skeletal muscle and liver, moderate expression in
pancreas, heart, and kidney, and weak expression in brain, placenta, and
lung.

By yeast 2-hybrid screen of a yeast genomic library using Emg1 (611531)
as bait, followed by PCR of a Jurkat cell cDNA library, Liu and Thiele
(2001) cloned a partial NOP14 cDNA, which they called NOP14. Subcellular
fractionation detected yeast Nop14 in the nuclear fraction, and
immunofluorescence microscopy localized Nop14 to the nucleolus.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis, coimmunoprecipitation, and deletion mapping,
Liu and Thiele (2001) showed that the central domain (amino acids 170 to
469) of yeast Nop14 interacted with Emg1 and that mouse Emg1 and human
NOP14 interacted. Emg1 localized to both nuclear and cytoplasmic
fractions in the presence of Nop14 but to the cytoplasmic fraction only
in Nop14-depleted cells. Pulse-chase labeling of ribosomal RNA
transcript processing in Nop14-depleted yeast showed a processing defect
characterized by absence of the 18S rRNA species and its 20S precursor
and normal levels of 25S rRNA, similar to the phenotype observed in Emg1
conditional mutant yeast. Sucrose density gradient profiling of cellular
ribosomes and polysome runoff strains found significantly reduced levels
of 40S subunits compared to 60S. Liu and Thiele (2001) concluded that
Nop14 and Emg1 act in the same pathway for 18S rRNA maturation and for
40S ribosome production.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hadano et al. (1998) determined that the NOP14 gene contains at least 16
exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Hadano et al. (1998) mapped the NOP14 gene
to chromosome 4p16.3.

;;TBP1-INTERACTING PROTEIN; TBPIP;;
GT198;;
HOP2, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; HOP2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The PSMC3IP gene encodes a nuclear, tissue-specific protein with
multiple functions, including a role in meiotic recombination and as a
coactivator of ligand-dependent transcription mediated by nuclear
hormone receptors (summary by Zangen et al., 2011).

CLONING

By sequencing putative genes centromeric to the BRCA1 gene (113705) on
chromosome 17, followed by screening a breast cancer cell line cDNA
library, Rommens et al. (1995) cloned GT198. The deduced protein
contains 203 amino acids. Northern blot analysis detected a 1.6-kb
transcript in all adult and fetal tissues examined, with abundant
expression in testis, colon, a breast cancer cell line, and a lymphoma.

Tanaka et al. (1997) cloned Gt198, which they called Tbpip, from a mouse
testis cDNA library. The deduced 217-amino acid protein has several
putative phosphorylation sites. RT-PCR detected Tbpip expression in CD4
(186940)-positive T cells and in macrophages. In situ hybridization
found Tbpip mRNA colocalized with Tbp1 (186852) in seminiferous tubules
of adult mouse testis. Western blot analysis detected Tbpip at an
apparent molecular mass of 24 kD. Immunohistochemical analysis of mouse
testis detected Tbpip in nuclei of primary and secondary spermatocytes.

By PCR using primers designed from mouse Tbpip, Ijichi et al. (2000)
cloned full-length human TBPIP from breast cancer cell line mRNA and a
testis cDNA library. The deduced 217-amino acid protein contains an
acidic region near the C terminus and several putative phosphorylation
sites. Mouse and human TBPIP share 88% amino acid homology.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Rommens et al. (1995) mapped the TBPIP
gene to chromosome 17q21. Using radiation hybrid analysis, Ijichi et al.
(2000) mapped the TBPIP gene to chromosome 17q12-q21.

GENE FUNCTION

The human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) regulatory protein Tat is
essential for HIV-1 gene expression and replication in infected cells.
TBP1 is a cellular protein that suppresses Tat-mediated transactivation
of HIV replication. Tanaka et al. (1997) found that mouse Tbpip
synergistically cooperated with Tbp1 to suppress Tat-mediated
transactivation of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat promoter.

Ijichi et al. (2000) showed that human TBPIP interacted directly with
TBP1 and enhanced TBP1-mediated inhibition of HIV Tat-mediated
transactivation.

Enomoto et al. (2006) demonstrated that coexpression of human MND1
(611422) and HOP2 in E. coli resulted in the formation of stable
heterodimers. The HOP2-MND1 complex stimulated DMC1 (602721)- and RAD51
(179617)-mediated DNA strand exchange, and preferentially bound to a
3-stranded DNA branch, which mimics the strand-exchange intermediate.
Enomoto et al. (2006) concluded that the HOP2-MND1 complex may ensure
proper pairing between homologous chromosomes by stimulating strand
exchange during meiosis.

Chi et al. (2007) found that the Hop2 component of the mouse recombinant
Hop2-Mnd1 complex was the major DNA-binding subunit, and that Mnd1 was
the Rad51-interacting entity. Hop2-Mnd1 stabilized the
Rad51-single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) nucleoprotein filament, and enhanced
the ability of the Rad51-ssDNA nucleoprotein filament to capture duplex
DNA, which is an obligatory step in the formation of the synaptic
complex critical for DNA joint formation. Pezza et al. (2007) showed
that the mouse Hop2-Mnd1 complex stimulated Dmc1 to promote synaptic
complex formation on long duplex DNAs. Synaptic alignment was a
consequence of the ability of Hop2-Mnd1 to stabilize the Dmc1-ssDNA
nucleoprotein complex and facilitate the conjoining of DNA molecules
through the capture of double-stranded DNA by the Dmc1-ssDNA
nucleoprotein filament.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a large consanguineous Arab Palestinian pedigree with
hypergonadotropic ovarian dysgenesis mapping to chromosome 17 (ODG3;
614324), Zangen et al. (2011) analyzed candidate genes and identified
homozygosity for a 3-bp deletion in the PSMC3IP gene (608665.0001) that
segregated with disease in the family. In cell lines, the glu201del
mutation abolished PSMC3IP activation of estrogen-driven transcription.

ANIMAL MODEL

Petukhova et al. (2003) found that Hop2 knockout mice showed no gross
anomalies in somatic tissues but developed a profound deficiency in
gametogenesis. Hop2 -/- spermatocytes arrested at the stage of
pachytene-like chromosome condensation. Axial elements were fully
developed, but synapsis was limited. While meiotic double-stranded
breaks were formed and processed in Hop2 -/- mice, they failed to be
repaired.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
OVARIAN DYSGENESIS 3
PSMC3IP, 3-BP DEL, 600GAG

In affected members of a large consanguineous Arab Palestinian pedigree
with hypergonadotropic ovarian dysgenesis (ODG3; 614324), Zangen et al.
(2011) identified homozygosity for an in-frame 3-bp deletion in the
acceptor splice junction of exon 8 of the PSMC3IP gene, resulting in
deletion of glu201. The unaffected parents were heterozygous for the
deletion, which was not found in 254 ethnically matched chromosomes.
RT-PCR analysis of leukocyte DNA from affected and unaffected family
members showed no alternative splicing, suggesting that the mutation
does not affect PSMC3IP splicing. Transfection studies in the IGROV1
ovarian carcinoma and MCF7 breast cancer cell lines demonstrated that
the glu201del mutation abolished PSMC3IP activation of estrogen-driven
transcription.

602170	TITLE *602170 MYELOID DIFFERENTIATION PRIMARY RESPONSE GENE 88; MYD88
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MyD88 is a key downstream adapter for most Toll-like receptors (TLRs)
and interleukin-1 receptors (IL1Rs) (summary by Von Bernuth et al.,
2008).

CLONING

The myeloid differentiation (MyD) marker MyD88 was first characterized
during a study of the early genetic responses of murine myeloid cells to
various differentiation and growth inhibitory stimuli (Lord et al.,
1990). Myeloid differentiation primary response genes are activated in
M1 myeloleukemic cells in response to interleukin-6 (IL6; 147620), which
induces both growth arrest and terminal differentiation. Hardiman et al.
(1997) described the cloning of the mouse MyD88 gene. The first exon
encodes a complete 'death domain' similar to the intracellular segment
of TNF receptor-1 (191190). Zoo-blot analysis demonstrated that it is an
evolutionarily conserved gene. Northern blot analysis revealed
widespread expression of the gene in many adult mouse tissues, and
RT-PCR detected MyD88 mRNA in T- and B-cell lines and differentiating
embryonic stem cells. The broad expression pattern demonstrated that
mouse Myd88 expression is not restricted to cells of myeloid lineage as
was originally believed.

Bonnert et al. (1997) cloned a human MYD88 cDNA that encodes a 296-amino
acid polypeptide with a predicted mass of 33 kD. MYD88 shares 81% amino
acid identity with murine MyD88. The 150-amino acid C-terminal region
has significant homology to the type I interleukin-1 receptor (147810)
cytoplasmic domain. Northern blot analysis revealed that human MYD88 is
expressed as 2 MYD88 hybridizing 1.6- and 3-kb mRNAs in a variety of
tissues and cell lines.

Using immunofluorescence analysis, Kagan and Medzhitov (2006) found that
human MYD88 localized to discrete foci scattered throughout the cytosol
of transfected mouse embryonic fibroblasts and macrophages.

GENE FUNCTION

Bonnert et al. (1997) found that overexpression of MYD88 caused an
increase in the level of transcription from the interleukin-8 (146930)
promoter.

Muzio et al. (1997) reported that the C-terminal domain of MYD88 has
significant sequence similarity to the cytoplasmic domain of IL1RAP
(602626). They showed that ectopic expression of MYD88 strongly induced
NFKB (e.g., 164011) activity in a concentration-dependent manner. In
addition, the C-terminal region of MYD88 acted as a dominant-negative
inhibitor of IL1R1 (147810)/IL1RAP-induced NFKB activity. MYD88 formed
an immunoprecipitable complex with IL1RAP and with IRAK2 (603304).

Medzhitov et al. (1998) demonstrated that signaling by the human TOLL
receptor (see TLR4; 603030) employs an adaptor protein, MyD88, and
induces activation of NFKB via the IRAK (IRAK1; 300283) kinase and the
TRAF6 (602355) protein. The Toll-mediated signaling cascade using the
NFKB pathway is essential for immune responses in adult Drosophila, and
a human homolog of the Drosophila Toll protein induces various immune
response genes via this pathway. These findings implicate MyD88 as a
general adaptor/regulator molecule for the Toll/IL1R family of receptors
for innate immunity.

Hayashi et al. (2001) showed that expression of TLR5 (603031) induces
NFKB (see 164011) activation and TNFA (191160) production.
Pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) known to stimulate other
TLR family members failed to stimulate TLR5; however, luciferase
reporter assays indicated TLR5 activation in gram-positive and -negative
bacterial culture supernatants. By fractionation of Listeria culture
supernatants followed by SDS-PAGE, Hayashi et al. (2001) identified
flagellin as the TLR5 ligand. Flagellin, a principal component of
bacterial flagella, is a virulence factor recognized by the innate
immune system in plants, insects, and mammals. Expression of flagellin
in nonflagellated bacteria resulted in TLR5 activation, and deletion of
flagellin from flagellated bacteria abrogated TLR5 activation. Hayashi
et al. (2001) demonstrated that injection of flagellin induces the
production of IL6 (147620) in wildtype mice, but not in those lacking
the MyD88 adaptor protein, required for TLR signaling. Hayashi et al.
(2001) concluded that TLR5 is a pattern-recognition receptor and that
its PAMP is flagellin, a protein with conserved N and C termini in a
broad group of motile pathogens.

Burns et al. (2003) noted that a MYD88 splice variant encodes a protein,
MYD88s, lacking the 58-amino acid intermediary domain between the death
domain and the C-terminal TIR domain. MYD88s is detected only after
continuous stimulation with bacterial products, such as
lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or proinflammatory cytokines. Expression of
MYD88s blocks LPS- or IL1-induced NFKB activation, even though, like the
full-length protein, MYD88s binds both IL1R and IRAK1. By Western blot
analysis of a reconstituted MYD88 -/- cell line, Burns et al. (2003)
showed that MYD88, but not MYD88s, triggered IRAK1 phosphorylation and
NFKB activation in an IRAK4 (606883)-dependent manner. MYD88s did not
bind IRAK4 and blocked its recruitment to IL1Rs. Burns et al. (2003)
concluded that MYD88s acts as a negative regulator of IL1R/TLR/MYD88
signals, leading to a controlled negative regulation of innate immune
responses.

Diebold et al. (2004) confirmed that mouse plasmacytoid dendritic cells
(PDCs) expressing B220 (PTPRC; 151460) but not Cd11b (ITGAM; 120980)
were resistant to suppression of Ifna (147660) production mediated by
influenza virus NS1 protein, suggesting that PDCs use a
dsRNA-independent pathway for recognizing influenza. Chloroquine
inhibited influenza-induced Ifna production, indicating that recognition
of the virus occurs in the endosomal compartment. Ifna production in
response to live or inactivated influenza virus or to viral genomic or
host ssRNA required the presence of Myd88 and Tlr7 (300365), but not
other TLRs.

Kagan and Medzhitov (2006) found that human TIRAP (606252), a TLR
adaptor protein, recruited human MYD88 to the plasma membrane of
transfected mouse fibroblasts and macrophages. They proposed that TIRAP
functions primarily to recruit MYD88 to activated TLR4 to initiate
signal transduction.

Chen et al. (2007) found that the acute neutrophilic inflammatory
response to cell injury requires the signaling protein Myd88. Analysis
of the contribution of Myd88-dependent receptors to this response
revealed only a minor reduction in mice doubly deficient in Toll-like
receptor-2 (Tlr2; 603028) and Tlr4 (603030) and normal responses in mice
lacking Tlr1 (601194), Tlr3 (603029), Tlr6 (605403), Tlr7 (300365), Tlr9
(605474), or Tlr11 (606270) or the IL18 receptor (IL18R; 604494).
However, mice lacking IL1R (147810) showed a markedly reduced
neutrophilic inflammatory response to dead cells and tissue injury in
vivo as well as greatly decreased collateral damage from inflammation.
This inflammatory response required IL1-alpha (147760), and IL1R
function was required on non-bone-marrow-derived cells. Notably, the
acute monocyte response to cell death, which is thought to be important
for tissue repair, was much less dependent on the IL1R-Myd88 pathway.
Also, this pathway was not required for the neutrophil response to a
microbial stimulus. These findings suggested that inhibiting the
IL1R-MYD88 pathway in vivo could block the damage from acute
inflammation that occurs in response to sterile cell death, and do so in
a way that might not compromise tissue repair or host defense against
pathogens.

Cirl et al. (2008) showed that virulent bacteria, such as uropathogenic
E. coli and Brucella melitensis, secreted inhibitory homologs of TIR
domain-containing proteins (TCPs). These TCPs promoted intracellular
bacterial survival and kidney pathology after instillation of organisms
in mouse bladder. Bacterial TCPs impeded TLR signaling through MYD88 and
impaired innate host defense. Molecular epidemiologic analysis of
clinical isolates from patients with urinary tract infections further
supported the proposal that bacterial TCPs represent a class of
virulence factors.

Alu RNA accumulation due to DICER1 (606241) deficiency in retinal
pigmented epithelium (RPE) is implicated in geographic atrophy, an
advanced form of age-related macular degeneration (AMD; see 603075).
Using mouse and human RPE cells and mice lacking various genes, Tarallo
et al. (2012) showed that a DICER1 deficit or Alu RNA exposure activated
the NLRP3 (606416) inflammasome, triggering TLR-independent MYD88
signaling via IL18 (600953) in the RPE. Inhibition of inflammasome
components, MYD88, or IL18 prevented RPE degeneration induced by DICER1
loss or Alu RNA exposure. Because RPE in human geographic atrophy
contained elevated NLRP3, PYCARD, and IL18, Tarallo et al. (2012)
suggested targeting this pathway for prevention and/or treatment of
geographic atrophy.

Zhu et al. (2012) showed that the direct, immediate, and disruptive
effects of IL1-beta (IL1B; 147720) on endothelial stability in a human
in vitro cell model are NF-kappa-B (see 164011)-independent and are
instead the result of signaling through the small GTPase
ADP-ribosylation factor-6 (ARF6; 600464) and its activator ARF
nucleotide-binding site opener (ARNO; 602488). Moreover, Zhu et al.
(2012) showed that ARNO binds directly to the adaptor protein MYD88, and
thus proposed MYD88-ARNO-ARF6 as a proximal IL1-beta signaling pathway
distinct from that mediated by NF-kappa-B. Finally, Zhu et al. (2012)
showed that SecinH3 (182115), an inhibitor of ARF guanine nucleotide
exchange factors such as ARNO, enhances vascular stability and
significantly improves outcomes in animal models of inflammatory
arthritis and acute inflammation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hardiman et al. (1997) described the gene structure of the mouse MyD88
gene. The complete coding sequence spans 5 exons.

Bonnert et al. (1997) found that the human MYD88 gene is encoded by 5
exons.

MAPPING

By interspecific backcross mapping, Hardiman et al. (1997) localized the
mouse MyD88 gene to chromosome 9; the human homolog was mapped to
3p22-p21.3 by PCR analysis of a chromosome 3 somatic cell hybrid mapping
panel. Bonnert et al. (1997) used fluorescence in situ hybridization to
map the human MYD88 gene to 3p22-3p21.3.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Lin et al. (2010) reported the crystal structure of the MyD88-IRAK4
(606883)-IRAK2 (603304) death domain complex, which revealed a
left-handed helical oligomer that consists of 6 MyD88, 4 IRAK4, and 4
IRAK2 death domains. Assembly of this helical signaling tower is
hierarchical, in which MyD88 recruits IRAK4 and the MyD88-IRAK4 complex
recruits the IRAK4 substrates IRAK2 or the related IRAK1. Formation of
these myddosome complexes brings the kinase domains of IRAKs into
proximity for phosphorylation and activation. Composite binding sites
are required for recruitment of the individual death domains in the
complex, which are confirmed by mutagenesis and previously identified
signaling mutations. Specificities of myddosome formation are dictated
by both molecular complementation and correspondence of surface
electrostatics.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Von Bernuth et al. (2008) identified 3 different mutations in the MYD88
gene in children with MYD88 deficiency (612260) that resulted in
susceptibility to pyogenic bacterial infections. Four children from 3
kindreds were homozygous for in-frame deletion of glu52 (E52del;
602170.0001). Two sibs were homozygous for an arg196-to-cys (R196C;
602170.0002) mutation, and 1 child from another kindred was compound
heterozygous for the R196C mutation and a leu93-to-pro (L93P;
602170.0003) mutation. Two sibs who died in infancy were presumably
homozygous for the same E52del mutation found in their surviving
brother. The mutations were not found in healthy controls, and all
affected conserved residues. Fibroblast from patients representing the 3
combinations of mutant MYD88 alleles showed normal MYD88 mRNA levels.
Western blot analysis revealed low MYD88 protein levels with the
homozygous E52del mutation and the compound heterozygous L93P/R196C
mutation and normal MYD88 protein levels with the R196C homozygous
mutation. Functional analysis using patient fibroblasts and expression
of wildtype or mutant alleles in cell lines confirmed that all 3 MYD88
mutations resulted in loss of function and led to complete MYD88
deficiency. Von Bernuth et al. (2008) concluded that, like IRAK4
deficiency (607676), MYD88 deficiency abolishes most cytokine responses
to TLR stimulation. Von Bernuth et al. (2008) noted that the immunologic
phenotype of the 9 children they reported with MYD88 deficiency was
similar to that of Myd88-deficient mice, but the infectious phenotype
was different. The MYD88-deficient patients were susceptible to
Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Streptococcus
pneumoniae, but were normally resistant to most other infectious agents.
In contrast, Myd88-deficient mice had been shown to be susceptible to
almost all pathogens tested.

of undetermined significance (MGUS) and Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia,
see 602170.0004.

ANIMAL MODEL

Adachi et al. (1998) observed that mice with a targeted disruption of
the Myd88 gene were unable to respond to IL1 (e.g., 147760), as
determined by defective T-cell proliferation and the production of
cytokines. Likewise, Myd88-deficient mice were unable to produce
gamma-interferon (IFNG; 147570) and mediate natural killer cell activity
in response to IL18 (600953). NFKB activation in response to IL1 or IL18
was also impaired. These results indicated that MYD88 is a critical
component in the IL1R and IL18R (604494) signaling cascades. Kawai et
al. (1999) extended these studies to show that responses to
lipopolysaccharide, mediated by TLR4 and CD14 (158120), were lost or
delayed in Myd88-deficient mice, establishing that MYD88 is part of the
TLR signaling cascade as well, acting just upstream of IRAK.

Takeuchi et al. (2000) showed that Tlr2 (603028)- and, particularly,
Myd88-deficient mice are highly susceptible, in terms of growth in blood
and kidney and decreased survival, to infection with Staphylococcus
aureus compared to wildtype mice. In vitro, Tlr2-deficient macrophages
produced reduced TNF and interleukin-6 (IL6; 147620) in response to S.
aureus compared to wildtype or Tlr4-deficient macrophages, whereas
Myd88-deficient macrophages produced no detectable TNF or IL6. The
authors concluded that TLR2 and MYD88 are critical in the defense
against gram-positive bacteria.

Skerrett et al. (2004) found that Myd88-deficient mice were highly
susceptible to aerosol infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but not to
aerosol infection with S. aureus. They concluded that Myd88-dependent
signaling is essential for innate immunity to P. aeruginosa and is
dispensable for resistance to pulmonary S. aureus infection.

Using nonlethal microbial stimuli on Il12b (161561)-deficient mice,
Jankovic et al. (2002) showed that although Th1-type cytokine production
was diminished in the absence of Il12b, the pathogen-specific Cd4
(186940)-positive T cells that emerged nevertheless displayed an
Ifng-dominated lymphokine profile and failed to default to a Th2
phenotype. In mice lacking both Il12b and Il10 (124092), these Th1 cells
were protective. In contrast, in mice lacking Myd88, not only was a
normal Th2-type response to Schistosoma mansoni antigens developed, but,
in response to Toxoplasma gondii antigens, no Ifng was detected and the
mice defaulted to a Th2-type response. Jankovic et al. (2002) proposed
that microbial-induced Th1 polarization is determined during the initial
encounter of pathogens with pattern recognition receptors (e.g., TLRs)
on antigen-presenting cells. They concluded that IL12, however, does not
determine Th1 versus Th2 phenotype.

LaRosa et al. (2008) generated bone marrow chimeras in which T cells,
but not cells involved in innate immune responses, lacked Myd88. These
chimeric mice showed increased susceptibility to T. gondii disease,
developing fatal encephalitis within 30 days. They displayed reduced
Ifng production, and the increased susceptibility was independent of
Il1r and Il18r signaling. LaRosa et al. (2008) proposed that, in
addition to innate immunity, MYD88 expression is necessary in T cells
for prolonged resistance to pathogens.

Bjorkbacka et al. (2004) examined atherosclerotic lesion development in
uninfected Apoe (APOE; 107741) single-null mice and Apoe -/- Myd88 -/-
double-null mice, and found that the Myd88-deficient mice showed a
marked reduction in early atherosclerosis. Inactivation of the Myd88
pathway led to a reduction in atherosclerosis through a decrease in
macrophage recruitment to the artery wall that was associated with
reduced chemokine levels. The findings linked elevated serum lipid
levels to a proinflammatory signaling cascade that is also engaged by
microbial pathogens.

To examine whether Toll-like receptor signaling regulates phagocytosis,
Blander and Medzhitov (2004) compared macrophages from wildtype, Myd88
null, and Tlr2-Tlr4 (603030) double-null mice. Myd null and Tlr2-Tlr4
double-null macrophages were unresponsive to inactivated E. coli.
Blander and Medzhitov (2004) found that activation of the Toll-like
receptor signaling pathway by bacteria, but not apoptotic cells,
regulated phagocytosis at multiple steps including internalization and
phagosome maturation. Phagocytosis of bacteria was impaired in the
absence of Toll-like receptor signaling. Two modes of phagosome
maturation were observed, constitutive and inducible; their differential
engagement depended on the ability of the cargo to trigger Toll-like
receptor signaling.

Fremond et al. (2004) noted that previous investigations had suggested a
minor and redundant role for TLR2, TLR4, and TLR6 (605403) in the early
host response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection, but a more
important role in control of chronic infection. Using Myd88 -/- mice,
Fremond et al. (2004) investigated the role of MYD88, which most TLRs,
except TLR3 (603029), use as an intracellular adaptor, in resistance to
Mtb. Macrophages from Myd88 -/- mice had normal upregulation of
costimulatory molecules but reduced cytokine production in response to
Mtb infection. Myd88 -/- mice succumbed to a low-dose aerosol Mtb
infection in approximately 4 weeks, whereas Tnf -/- mice died within 3
weeks, and wildtype mice survived. Death was accompanied by
significantly reduced body weight, increased lung weight, and 2 logs
higher bacillary burden. Like Tnf -/- mice, Myd88 -/- mice developed
massive necrosis and infiltration of inflammatory cells, primarily
neutrophils and macrophages, in lungs. Although BCG vaccination failed
to elicit a delayed-type hypersensitivity response in Myd88 -/- mice, it
did induce antigen-specific Ifng production in splenocytes and also
protected the mice from acute Mtb infection. The Myd88 -/- mice could
not, however, durably control the infection. Fremond et al. (2004)
concluded that the MYD88-mediated signaling pathway is critically
involved in the development of innate, but not adaptive, immunity in
response to Mtb infection.

Using mice lacking Myd88 or various members of the IL1R/TLR superfamily,
Bellocchio et al. (2004) found that the Myd88-dependent pathway was
required for resistance to Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus.
Myd88 signaling could occur through distinct TLRs depending on the
fungal pathogen and the route of infection, and individual TLRs
activated specialized antifungal effector functions on neutrophils.
Myd88-dependent signaling in dendritic cells was crucial for priming the
antifungal Th1 response. Bellocchio et al. (2004) concluded that innate
and adaptive immunity to C. albicans and A. fumigatus requires the
coordinated action of distinct members of the IL1R/TLR superfamily
acting through MYD88.

To evaluate the role of TLRs in B-cell activation and antibody
production, Pasare and Medzhitov (2005) transferred purified B cells
from wildtype, Myd88-deficient, Tlr4-deficient, and Cd40
(109535)-deficient mice into B cell-deficient mu-MT mice, which have a
mutation in the Ighm gene (147020). They found that primary B-cell
activation, including induction of IgM, IgG1, and IgG2 responses, but
not IgE or, probably, IgA responses, required TLRs in addition to helper
T cells. In contrast, Cd40 was required for isotype switching.

Hyaluronan, an extracellular matrix glycosaminoglycan with a repeating
disaccharide structure, is produced after tissue injury, and impaired
clearance results in unremitting inflammation. Jiang et al. (2005) noted
that CD44 (107269) is essential for regulating turnover of hyaluronan,
but it is not required for expression of chemokines by macrophages after
lung injury. Using Tlr-deficient mouse macrophages, they found that
hyaluronan fragments stimulated Mip2 (CXCL2; 139110), Mip1a (CCL3;
182283), and Kc (CXCL1; 155730) in a Tlr2- and Tlr4-dependent manner
that also required Myd88. Mice deficient in Tlr2, Tlr4, or Myd88 showed
impaired transepithelial migration of inflammatory cells, but decreased
survival and enhanced epithelial cell apoptosis after lung injury. Lung
epithelial cell overexpression of high molecular mass hyaluronan
protected against acute lung injury and apoptosis, in part, through
TLR-dependent basal activation of NFKB. Jiang et al. (2005) concluded
that interaction of TLR2 and TLR4 with hyaluronan provides signals that
initiate inflammatory responses, maintain epithelial cell integrity, and
promote recovery from acute lung injury.

Mice genetically deficient in both Myd88 and Trif (607601) have a
complete lack of known Toll-like receptor signaling, thus allowing
assessment of Toll-like receptor dependence of antibody responses. Gavin
et al. (2006) used these double knockouts to investigate the role of
Toll-like receptor signaling in antibody responses to immunization and
the augmenting roles of 4 typical adjuvants (alum, Freund complete
adjuvant, Freund incomplete adjuvant, and monophosphoryl-lipid
A/trehalose dicorynomycolate adjuvant) to that response. Regardless of
adjuvant, these mice exhibited robust antibody responses. Gavin et al.
(2006) concluded that Toll-like receptor signaling does not account for
the action of classical adjuvants and does not fully explain the action
of strong adjuvant containing a Toll-like receptor ligand.

Brown et al. (2007) found that Myd88 -/- mice and Ptgs2 -/- mice
exhibited a profound inhibition of endothelial proliferation and
cellular organization within rectal crypts after injury. The effects of
injury in both mutant mouse strains could be rescued by exogenous
prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), suggesting that Myd88 signaling is upstream of
Ptgs2 and PGE2. In wildtype mice, the combination of injury and Myd88
signaling led to repositioning of a subset of Ptgs2-expressing stromal
cells from the mesenchyme surrounding the middle and upper crypts to an
area surrounding the crypt base adjacent to colonic epithelial
progenitor cells. Brown et al. (2007) concluded that the MYD88 and
prostaglandin signaling pathways interact to preserve epithelial
proliferation during injury, and that proper cellular mobilization
within the crypt niche is critical to repair after injury.

Apc (611731) Min/+ mice spontaneously develop intestinal tumors and, on
average, die within 6 months of age. Rakoff-Nahoum and Medzhitov (2007)
showed that deletion of Myd88 in Min/+ mice reduced morbidity and
mortality, as well as the size and numbers of intestinal polyps,
compared with sex- and age-matched controls. They concluded that
MYD88-dependent signaling controls the expression of several key
modifier genes of intestinal tumorigenesis and that MYD88 has a critical
role in both spontaneous and carcinogen-induced tumor development.

Wen et al. (2008) showed that specific pathogen-free NOD mice lacking
Myd88, an adaptor for multiple innate immune receptors that recognize
microbial stimuli, do not develop type 1 diabetes (222100). The effect
is dependent on commensal microbes because germ-free Myd88-negative NOD
mice develop robust diabetes, whereas colonization of these germ-free
Myd88-negative NOD mice with a defined microbial consortium
(representing bacterial phyla normally present in human gut) attenuates
type 1 diabetes. Wen et al. (2008) also found that Myd88 deficiency
changes the composition of the distal gut microbiota, and that exposure
to the microbiota of specific pathogen-free Myd88-negative NOD donors
attenuates type 1 diabetes in germ-free NOD recipients. Wen et al.
(2008) concluded that, taken together, their findings indicated that
interaction of the intestinal microbes with the innate immune system is
a critical epigenetic factor modifying type 1 diabetes predisposition.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MYD88 DEFICIENCY
MYD88, 3-BP DEL, 160GAG

Von Bernuth et al. (2008) identified a homozygous in-frame 3-bp (GAG)
deletion in exon 1 of the MYD88 gene, resulting in deletion of glu52
(E52del), in 4 children with functional MYD88 deficiency (612260). A
French patient with the E52del mutation died in infancy. Two sibs of a
Spanish Gypsy patient with the mutation also died in infancy and were
presumed to have the mutation. The surviving patients were 3.5 to 7
years old. All patients shared a history of susceptibility to pyogenic
bacterial infections caused by S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, or S.
pneumoniae. Functional analysis confirmed that the E52del mutation
resulted in loss of function.

.0002
MYD88 DEFICIENCY
MYD88, ARG196CYS

Von Bernuth et al. (2008) identified a homozygous 586C-T transition in
exon 3 of the MYD88 gene, resulting in an arg196-to-cys (R196C)
substitution, in 2 sibs from Portugal with functional MYD88 deficiency
(612260). These patients were 9 and 16 years old. Von Bernuth et al.
(2008) also identified an unrelated, 3-year-old patient from Turkey who
was compound heterozygous for the R196C mutation and a 278T-C transition
in exon 1 that resulted in a leu93-to-pro (L93P; 602170.0003)
substitution. All 3 patients shared a history of susceptibility to
pyogenic bacterial infections caused by S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, or S.
pneumoniae. Functional analysis confirmed that both mutations resulted
in loss of function.

MYD88, LEU265PRO (dbSNP rs38182641)

Ngo et al. (2011) described the dependence of activated B cell-like
(ABC) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCLs) on MYD88 and the discovery
of highly recurrent oncogenic mutations affecting MYD88 in ABC DLBCL
tumors. RNA interference screening revealed that MYD88 and the
associated kinases IRAK1 (300283) and IRAK4 (606883) are essential for
ABC DLBCL survival. High-throughput RNA resequencing uncovered MYD88
mutations in ABC DLBCL lines. Notably, 29% of ABC DLBCL tumors harbored
the same amino acid substitution, L265P, in the MYD88 Toll/IL1 receptor
(TIR) domain at an evolutionarily invariant residue in its hydrophobic
core. This mutation was rare or absent in other DLBCL subtypes and
Burkitt lymphoma (113970), but was observed in 9% of mucosa-associated
lymphoid tissue lymphomas. At a lower frequency, additional mutations
were observed in the MYD88 TIR domain, occurring in both the ABC and
germinal center B cell-like (GCB) DLBCL subtypes. Survival of ABC DLBCL
cells bearing the L265P mutation was sustained by the mutant but not the
wildtype MYD88 isoform, demonstrating that L265P is a gain-of-function
driver mutation. The L265P mutant promoted cell survival by
spontaneously assembling a protein complex containing IRAK1 and IRAK4,
leading to IRAK4 kinase activity, IRAK1 phosphorylation, NF-kappa-B (see
164011) signaling, JAK kinase (see 147795) activation of STAT3 (102582),
and secretion of IL6 (147620), IL10 (124092), and interferon-beta
(147640). Hence, Ngo et al. (2011) concluded that the MYD88 signaling
pathway is integral to the pathogenesis of ABC DLBCL, supporting the
development of inhibitors of IRAK4 kinase and other components of this
pathway for the treatment of tumors bearing oncogenic MYD88 mutations.

Treon et al. (2012) performed whole-genome sequencing of bone marrow
lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL) cells in 30 patients with Waldenstrom
macroglobulinemia (153600), with paired normal-tissue and tumor-tissue
sequencing in 10 patients. Sanger sequencing was used to validate the
findings from an expanded cohort of patients with LPL, those with other
B-cell disorders that have some of the same features as LPL, and healthy
donors. Among the patients with Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, Treon et
al. (2012) identified a somatic mutation, L265P (dbSNP rs38182641), in
samples from all 10 patients with paired tissue samples and in 17 of 20
samples from patients with unpaired samples. This T-to-C transition
predicted an amino acid change that triggers IRAK-mediated NF-kappa-B
signaling. Sanger sequencing identified MYD88 L265P in tumor samples
from 49 of 54 patients with Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia and in 3 of 3
patients with non-IgM-secreting lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL) (91% of
all patients with LPL). MYD88 L265P was absent in paired normal-tissue
samples from patients with Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia or non-IgM LPL
and in B cells from healthy donors and was absent or rarely expressed in
samples from patients with multiple myeloma, marginal-zone lymphoma, or
IgM monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance. Inhibition of MYD88
signaling reduced I-kappa-B-alpha (164008) and NF-kappa-B p65 (164014)
phosphorylation, as well as NF-kappa-B nuclear staining, in Waldenstrom
macroglobulinemia cells expressing MYD88 L265P. Similar results were
obtained when cells expressing MYD88 L265P were incubated with an
IRAK1/4 kinase inhibitor. Somatic variants in ARID1A (603024) in 5 of 30
patients (17%), leading to a premature stop or frameshift, were also
identified and were associated with an increased disease burden. In
addition, 2 of 3 patients with Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia who had
wildtype MYD88 had somatic variants in MLL2 (602113). Treon et al.
(2012) concluded that MYD88 L265P is a commonly recurring mutation in
patients with Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia that can be useful in
differentiating Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia and non-IgM LPL from
B-cell disorders that have phenotypic overlap.

Landgren and Staudt (2012) used Sanger sequencing to assess the status
of MYD88 L265P expression in patients with IgM monoclonal gammopathy of
undetermined significance (MGUS) and found expression of this variant in
5 of 9 patients. All of these patients had both clonal plasma cells and
clonal lymphocytes in bone marrow (lymphoplasmacytic precursor
neoplasm), suggesting to Landgren and Staudt (2012) that this mutation
is a precursor to Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia rather than
transformation from IgM MGUS to Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia. Treon et
al. (2012) commented that, to overcome the limitations of Sanger
sequencing, they developed an allele-specific polymerase chain reaction
(AS-PCR) assay to detect the MYD88 L265P mutation with a threshold
detection limit of 0.1% (approximately 100-fold better than that of
Sanger sequencing). They found that 88 of 96 patients with Waldenstrom
macroglobulinemia (92%) and 5 of 11 patients with IgM MGUS (45%), as
defined by consensus criteria, were positive for MYD88 L265P expression
by either conventional or quantitative AS-PCR assays. Treon et al.
(2012) concluded that IgM MGUS is heterogeneous and that MYD88 L265P is
probably a driver mutation toward Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia.

607290	TITLE *607290 SHISA, XENOPUS, HOMOLOG OF, 5; SHISA5
;;SCOTIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Zhang et al. (2000) cloned a cDNA encoding Scotin, which they called
HSPC217, from CD34 (142230)-positive hematopoietic stem/progenitor
cells. The deduced 170-amino acid protein contains an MYB (189990)
DNA-binding domain repeat signature. Microarray analysis of 5
hematopoietic cell lines detected low-level expression of Scotin in NB4
and Jurkat cells, but no expression was detected in HL60, K562, and U937
cells.

Bourdon et al. (2002) identified mouse Scotin by differential display of
spleen and thymus of normal and p53 (191170) null mice after gamma
irradiation of whole animals. The induced 1.85-kb transcript encodes a
deduced 235-amino acid protein. By searching an EST database using the
mouse sequence as probe, followed by 5-prime and 3-prime RACE, Bourdon
et al. (2002) cloned a full-length cDNA encoding Scotin from a placenta
cDNA library. The deduced 240-amino acid human protein shares 70%
identity with mouse Scotin. Both the human and the mouse proteins
contain an N-terminal signal sequence, a central transmembrane domain
composed of 18 hydrophobic amino acids, and a proline/tyrosine domain,
and both show an apparent molecular mass of 25 kD by Western blot
analysis. Immunolocalization of exogenously expressed Scotin revealed
colocalization with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) markers. By mutation
analysis, Bourdon et al. (2002) determined that the proline-rich domain
is required for ER localization.

GENE FUNCTION

Bourdon et al. (2002) noted that mouse thymus and spleen cells underwent
massive p53-dependent apoptosis following ultraviolet irradiation or
exposure to actinomycin D. They found that Scotin mRNA was induced
coincident with apoptosis and was expressed only in spleen and thymus of
irradiated wildtype mice and not in the spleen or thymus of irradiated
p53 null mice. Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays, they
confirmed direct binding between p53 and Scotin, and using a luciferase
reporter plasmid driven by the mouse Scotin promoter, they confirmed
dose-dependent p53 transactiviation. Furthermore, Bourdon et al. (2002)
showed that the apoptosis induced by the p53/Scotin pathway is caspase
dependent.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Bourdon et al. (2002) determined that the
human Scotin gene contains 6 exons. They identified a p53-responsive
element of 9 decamers within the mouse Scotin promoter.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Zhang et al. (2000) mapped the human
Scotin gene to chromosome 3. By genomic sequence analysis, Bourdon et
al. (2002) mapped the Scotin gene to chromosome 3p21.3. They also
identified a Scotin pseudogene on chromosome Xq13.1-q13.3.

600007	TITLE *600007 FMS-RELATED TYROSINE KINASE 3 LIGAND; FLT3LG
;;FLT3 LIGAND; FL; FLT3L
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Dendritic cells (DCs) provide the key link between innate and adaptive
immunity by recognizing pathogens and priming pathogen-specific immune
responses. FLT3LG controls the development of DCs and is particularly
important for plasmacytoid DCs and CD8 (see 186910)-positive classical
DCs and their CD103 (ITGAE; 604682)-positive tissue counterparts
(summary by Sathaliyawala et al., 2010).

CLONING

FMS-related tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3; 136351) is a tyrosine kinase
receptor structurally related to macrophage colony-stimulating factor
(CSF1; 120420) and to mast cell growth factor receptor (KIT; 164920).
From a murine T-cell line, Lyman et al. (1993) cloned a novel
hematopoietic growth factor that is a ligand for FLT3. Lyman et al.
(1994) used a fragment of the murine cDNA to clone the human FLT3
ligand, which is similar in structure to the murine protein and shares
72% amino acid identity. Northern blot analysis showed widespread
expression of FLT3 ligand mRNA transcripts in human tissues.

Hannum et al. (1994) isolated a soluble protein that showed FL activity
from medium conditioned by mouse thymic stromal cells. By sequencing
peptides and screening thymic stromal cell lines, they cloned splice
variants of mouse and human FL. The deduced 235- and 245-amino acid
human isoforms differ in their C-terminal segments, with the shorter
protein containing a unique transmembrane domain. The N terminus of both
isoforms contains a signal peptide followed by a cytokine domain related
to KIT ligand (KITLG; 184745) and macrophage colony-stimulating factor
(CSF1; 120420). The cytokine domain also has N-glycosylation sites.
Northern blot analysis showed widespread expression in mouse and human
tissues, with highest levels in spleen and lung. The major human
transcript was 1.6 kb. High expression was also detected in mouse and
human stromal cell lines, with highest levels in T-cell lines and
peripheral blood mononuclear cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Lyman et al. (1993) found that Flt3 ligand stimulated proliferation of
hematopoietic progenitor cells isolated from mouse fetal liver or adult
mouse bone marrow.

Hannum et al. (1994) showed that transfection of COS cells with mouse
and human FL containing the C-terminal transmembrane domain resulted in
secretion of a soluble protein with FL activity. Assays of C-terminally
truncated FL proteins confirmed that the N-terminal half conferred FL
activity. Recombinant protein produced by either mouse fibroblasts or E.
coli induced tyrosine autophosphorylation of Flt3 on mouse cells. The
purified protein enhanced the response of mouse stem cells and primitive
human progenitor cells to other growth factors, such as IL3 (147740),
IL6 (147620), and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor
(CSF2; 138960), and it also stimulated fetal thymocytes. Hannum et al.
(1994) concluded that FL enhances the response of stem and primitive
progenitor cells to other growth factors to generate all myeloid
lineages except erythroid cells.

Sathaliyawala et al. (2010) found that the Mtor (FRAP1; 601231)
inhibitor rapamycin impaired mouse Flt3l-driven DC development in vitro,
with plasmacytoid DCs and classical DCs most profoundly affected.
Depletion of the Pi3k (see 601232)-Mtor negative regulator Pten (601728)
facilitated Flt3l-driven DC development in culture. Targeting Pten in
DCs in vivo caused expansion of Cd8-positive and Cd103-positive
classical DCs, which could be reversed by rapamycin. Increased
Cd8-positive classical DC numbers caused by Pten deletion correlated
with increased susceptibility to Listeria infection. Sathaliyawala et
al. (2010) concluded that PI3K-MTOR signaling downstream of FLT3L
controls DC development, and that restriction by PTEN ensures optimal DC
numbers and subset composition.

BTB/POZ DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 12; BTBD12;;
MUS312, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF; MUS312;;
KIAA1784;;
KIAA1987
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SLX4 functions as a critical scaffold element for the assembly of a
multiprotein complex containing enzymes involved in DNA maintenance and
repair (Svendsen et al., 2009).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
libraries, Nagase et al. (2001, 2001) cloned the partial cDNAs KIAA1987
and KIAA1784, which represent the 5-prime and 3-prime ends of SLX4,
respectively. Both cDNAs contain repetitive elements in their UTRs.
RT-PCR ELISA detected low to moderate expression in all adult and fetal
tissues and specific adult brain regions examined.

By searching for sequences similar to fungal Slx4 proteins and
Drosophila Mus312, Fekairi et al. (2009) identified human SLX4. The
deduced 1,834-amino acid protein contains 2 N-terminal C2HC-type zinc
fingers, followed by a putative protein-protein interaction motif, a
central BTB/POZ domain, a SAP motif, and a conserved C-terminal domain.

GENE FUNCTION

By analyzing proteins that purified with epitope-tagged SLX4 from human
embryonic kidney cells, Svendsen et al. (2009) showed that SLX4
associated with the heterodimeric DNA flap endonucleases ERCC4
(133520)-ERCC1 (126380) and MUS81 (606591)-EME1 (610885) and the human
ortholog of the yeast Slx1 endonuclease. In humans, 2 genes, GIYD1 and
GIYD2, encode identical SLX1 proteins. SLX4 also associated with the
telomere-interacting protein TERF2 (602027) and its partner TERF2IP
(605061), the protein kinase PLK1 (602098), the MSH2 (609309)-MSH3
(600887) mismatch repair complex, and C20ORF94. Similar complexes were
detected in other human cell lines examined. Domain analysis showed that
MSH2-MSH3, ERCC4-ERCC1, and C20ORF94 associated with the N-terminal
region of SLX4, while TERF2-TERF2IP, MUS81-EME1, and PLK1 bound the
C-terminal region of SLX4. SLX1 associated with the extreme C terminus
of SLX4. The SLX4 complex was recruited to sites of DNA damage and
repaired 3-prime flap, 5-prime flap, and replication fork structures,
consistent with the activities of the SLX4-associated DNA repair
factors. The SLX1-SLX4 module specifically promoted symmetrical cleavage
of static and migrating Holliday junctions. PLK1 phosphorylated SLX4 in
situ, suggesting that phosphorylation of SLX4 regulates DNA repair by
the SLX4 complex. Svendsen et al. (2009) concluded that the SLX4 complex
is required for repair of specific types of DNA lesions and is critical
for cellular responses to replication fork failure.

Using yeast 2-hybrid assays, Fekairi et al. (2009) showed that human
SLX4 interacted with SLX1. Mutation analysis showed that the C-terminal
domain of SLX4 was required for the interaction. The SLX1-SLX4 duplex
functioned as a 5-prime flap endonuclease against a DNA stem loop
substrate, and it resolved Holliday junctions into linear duplex
products in the presence of Mn(2+). SLX1-SLX4 duplex activity was
dependent on SLX1. However, SLX4, but not SLX1, was required for
interstrand crosslink repair, suggesting that SLX4 functions with other
endonucleases to repair interstrand crosslinks.

Wechsler et al. (2011) used Bloom syndrome (210900) cells, in which the
BLM gene (604610) is inactive, to analyze human cells compromised for
the known Holliday junction dissolution/resolution pathways. Wechsler et
al. (2011) showed that depletion of MUS81 and GEN1 (612449), or SLX4 and
GEN1, from Bloom syndrome cells results in severe chromosome
abnormalities, such that sister chromatids remain interlinked in a
side-by-side arrangement and the chromosomes are elongated and
segmented. Wechsler et al. (2011) concluded that normally replicating
human cells require Holliday junction processing activities to prevent
sister chromatid entanglements and thereby ensure accurate chromosome
condensation. This phenotype was not apparent when both MUS81 and SLX4
were depleted from Bloom syndrome cells, suggesting that GEN1 can
compensate for their absence. Additionally, Wechsler et al. (2011)
showed that depletion of MUS81 or SLX4 reduces the high frequency of
sister chromatid exchanges in Bloom syndrome cells, indicating that
MUS81 and SLX4 promote sister chromatid exchange formation, in events
that may ultimately drive the chromosome instabilities that underpin
early-onset cancers associated with Bloom syndrome.

MAPPING

Hartz (2010) mapped the SLX4 gene to chromosome 16p13.3 based on an
alignment of the SLX4 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK095411) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a Dutch boy, born of consanguineous parents, with Fanconi anemia of
complementation group P (FANCP; 613951), Stoepker et al. (2011)
identified a homozygous truncating mutation in the SLX4 gene
(613278.0001). The gene was chosen for study because of its known
function as a scaffold protein in the DNA repair pathway. Stoepker et
al. (2011) identified compound heterozygous mutations in the SLX4 gene
(613278.0002 and 613278.0003) in 3 German sibs with a milder FANCP
phenotype.

Kim et al. (2011) identified biallelic mutations in the SLX4 gene
(613278.0004-613278.0006) in 2 unrelated patients with FANCP.

ANIMAL MODEL

Crossan et al. (2011) found that Slx4-null mice recapitulated the
features of Fanconi anemia in humans. Slx4-null mice were born at
submendelian ratios and had greatly reduced fertility due to gonad
dysfunction. Ovaries showed absence of oocytes, and testes showed
progressive failure of spermatogenesis. Many mutant mice died soon after
birth, and the survivors showed poor growth, with domed skulls and
ocular anomalies. Mutant mice also showed blood cytopenia, indicating
hematologic dysfunction. Cells derived from the mutant mice exhibited
premature senescence, spontaneously accumulated damaged chromosomes, and
were sensitive to DNA crosslinking agents, but not to UV radiation.
Genetic complementation studies revealed a crucial requirement for Slx4
to interact with the structure-specific endonuclease Ercc1 to promote
crosslink repair.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
FANCONI ANEMIA, COMPLEMENTATION GROUP P
SLX4, 1-BP DEL, 286A

In a Dutch boy, born of consanguineous parents, with Fanconi anemia of
complementation group P (FANCP; 613951), Stoepker et al. (2011)
identified a homozygous 1-bp deletion (286delA) in exon 1 of the SLX4
gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature termination at codon 126.
Patient lymphoblasts showed spontaneous chromosomal breakage as well as
chromosomal breakage in response to mitomycin C and camptothecin.
Immunoassays of patient lymphoblasts did not detect a full-length
protein, but there was a small amount of residual truncated protein
identified with antibodies against the C terminus, which may have been
derived from an alternative translation initiation site at codon 213 in
the SLX4 gene. Transient expression in HEK298 cells of a truncated
protein starting at met213 showed that it was able to interact with
ERCC1 (126380), MUS81 (606591)-EME1 (610885), and SLX1. The cellular
defects in this patient were believed to result from low levels of a
truncated protein, resulting in a defect in the interaction of SLX4 with
ERCC1. Transfection of a partial mouse Slx4 protein in patient cells
partially restored chromosome breakage defects. The patient had growth
retardation, mild dysmorphic features, hypoplastic right thumb, and
pancytopenia.

FANCONI ANEMIA, COMPLEMENTATION GROUP P
SLX4, 1-BP DEL, 1093C

In 3 German sibs with FANCP (613951), Stoepker et al. (2011) identified
compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the SLX4 gene: a 1-bp
deletion (1093delC), resulting in a frameshift and premature
termination, and a splice site mutation in intron 5 (1163+3dupT;
613278.0003). The splice site mutation caused the skipping of exon 5 and
resulted in an in-frame deletion disrupting the UBZ4 domain, which may
be involved in targeting SLX4 to sites of DNA damage by binding to
ubiquitinated proteins. Residual mutant protein in cell lysates was able
to interact with ERCC4 (133520), ERCC1 (126380) and MUS81 (606591).
Lymphoblasts from these individuals were sensitive to mitomycin C, but
not to camptothecin, indicating that the mutant protein was partially
functional. All 3 patients had pancytopenia.

SLX4, IVS5DS, T-A, +2

In a 15-year-old girl from south India with FANCP (613951), Kim et al.
(2011) identified a homozygous T-to-A transversion (1163+2T-A) in intron
5 of the SLX4 gene, resulting in the skipping of exon 5 and an in-frame
deletion of the conserved cysteine and leucine of the first UBZ domain
and the whole second UBZ domain. Immunoprecipitation studies of patient
fibroblasts showed a slightly shorter protein product. Patient
fibroblasts and lymphoblastoid cell lines showed increased genomic
instability and increased sensitivity to mitomycin C; however,
fibroblasts were not sensitive to camptothecin. Expression of wildtype
SLX4 into patient fibroblasts rescued the phenotype. ERCC4, MUS81, and
ERCC1 coimmunoprecipitated with the mutant protein in fibroblasts, but
levels of the mutant protein were consistently lower in multiple
experiments, leading to diminished immunoprecipitation of the
interacting factors. The patient presented at age 9 years with isolated
thrombocytopenia and had short stature and vitiligo.

.0005
FANCONI ANEMIA, COMPLEMENTATION GROUP P
SLX4, 1-BP DEL, 514C

In a 22-year-old man with FANCP (613951), Kim et al. (2011) identified
compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the SLX4 gene: a 1-bp
deletion (514delC) in exon 2, resulting in a frameshift and truncated
protein, and a large genomic deletion extending from intron 9 to exon 12
(2013+225_3147del4890insCC; 613278.0006), predicted to result in a
truncated protein. Immunoprecipitation studies failed to identify the
full-length protein in patient fibroblasts. Patient fibroblasts showed
increased genomic instability and increased sensitivity to mitomycin C
and camptothecin; however, lymphoblastoid cell lines were not sensitive
to mitomycin C, suggesting reversion. Expression of wildtype SLX4 into
patient fibroblasts rescued the cellular phenotype. Overexpression of
the 514delC-mutant protein in patient fibroblasts showed diminished, but
present, interaction with ERCC4 (133520) and ERCC1 (126380), but not
with MUS81 (606591). Immunoprecipitation of patient fibroblasts with an
antibody recognizing the N terminus of SLX4 showed greatly diminished
interaction with ERCC4, ERCC1, and MUS81. The patient was an American of
European descent, and he had bilateral absent thumbs and right radial
aplasia, pelvic kidney, undescended left testicle, malformed auricle,
and short stature, as well as low platelets and anemia. He developed
squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue at age 21 years and died at age
22.

;;CADHERIN, PLACENTAL;;
P-CADHERIN; PCAD;;
CALCIUM-DEPENDENT ADHESION PROTEIN, PLACENTAL;;
CDHP
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Cadherins, such as CDH3, are integral membrane glycoproteins responsible
for calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion.

CLONING

Nose and Takeichi (1986) identified a novel cadherin cell adhesion
molecule, P-cadherin, expressed in mouse placenta.

Using mouse P-cadherin as probe, Shimoyama et al. (1989) cloned human
CDH3 from an epidermoid carcinoma cell line (A431) cDNA library. The
deduced 829-amino acid protein contains a signal sequence, a
transmembrane region, 4 cysteine residues in the extracellular domain,
and 3 N-linked glycosylation sites. CDH3 shares 82% sequence homology
with the mouse protein and 67% homology with uvomorulin (CDH1; 192090).
Northern blot analysis revealed a 3.2-kb transcript in A431 cells, but
not in human placenta. Western blot analysis of A431 cells and
transfected NIH 3T3 cells revealed an apparent molecular mass of more
than 116 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

Shimoyama et al. (1989) found that CDH3 transfected into NIH 3T3 cells
was expressed at the cell-cell border. Cells expressing CDH3 also
adhered to one another more tightly than the parental cell line.

Soler et al. (2002) found high levels of P-cadherin in human milk.
Immunohistochemistry revealed apical staining for P-cadherin in
epithelial cells of lactating tissue, and the staining pattern was
similar to that of a secreted protein. Staining was not found at
cell-cell borders. Western blot analysis of human milk revealed a
truncated, soluble 80-kD P-cadherin protein containing the extracellular
domain but not the intracellular domain.

Overexpression of P-cadherin has been associated with proliferative
lesions of high histologic grade, decreased cell polarity, and poor
survival of patients with breast cancer. In vitro studies showed that it
can be upregulated by the antiestrogen drug ICI 182,780, suggesting that
the lack of estrogen receptor-alpha (ESRA; 133430) signaling may
responsible for the aberrant P-cadherin overexpression and for its role
in inducing breast cancer cell invasion and migration. Albergaria et al.
(2010) showed that ICI 182,780 was able to increase P-cadherin promoter
activity, inducing high levels of the active chromatin marker H3
lysine-4 dimethylation (H3K4me2). Albergaria et al. (2010) also showed
that CEBPB (189965) was able to upregulate CDH3 promoter activity in
breast cancer cells. Moreover, the expression of P-cadherin and CEBPB
were highly associated in human breast carcinomas and linked with a
worse prognosis in breast cancer patients. The authors concluded that
epigenetic upregulation of P-cadherin by ICI 182,780 in MCF-7/AZ breast
cancer cells occurs through chromatin remodeling at the CDH3 promoter,
bringing forward the growing evidence that ESRA signaling abrogation by
antiestrogens may be able to induce the expression of ESRA-repressed
genes which, in the appropriate cell biology context, may contribute to
a breast cancer cell invasion phenotype.

MAPPING

The E-cadherin (CDH1) and P-cadherin genes are tightly linked on
chromosome 8 of the mouse (Hatta et al., 1991). Since the human CDH1
locus is on 16q22.1, the P-cadherin gene is probably in the same
location. Kremmidiotis et al. (1998) mapped the human CDH3 gene to
16q22.1 using somatic cell hybrid panels. They demonstrated that 5
cadherin genes (CDH1; CDH3; CDH5, 601120; CDH8, 603008; and CDH11,
600023) are clustered in the 16q21-q22.1 region.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Hypotrichosis with juvenile macular dystrophy (HJMD; 601553) is a rare
recessive disorder. Sprecher et al. (2001) studied 4 large
consanguineous HJMD families with 11 affected individuals, belonging to
the Druze population in northern Israel. By homozygosity mapping, they
assigned the disease locus to 16q22.1, the region containing the CDH3
gene. Searching this positional candidate, they found a common
homozygous deletion in exon 8 of the CDH3 gene (114021.0001) in all 4
families.

Kjaer et al. (2005) studied 2 families with ectodermal dysplasia,
ectrodactyly, and macular dystrophy (EEM; 225280) and identified
homozygous mutations in CDH3 in affected individuals: a missense
mutation (114021.0003) and a deletion (114021.0004), respectively.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HYPOTRICHOSIS, CONGENITAL, WITH JUVENILE MACULAR DYSTROPHY
CDH3, 1-BP DEL, 981G

In 4 Druze families, Sprecher et al. (2001) demonstrated that
hypotrichosis with juvenile macular dystrophy (601553) was caused by
homozygous deletion of a guanine nucleotide in exon 8 at position 981
from the translation start site (ATG) of CDH3. The 981delG mutation
abolished the recognition site for NlaIII and was predicted to result in
a frameshift that introduced a premature termination codon 23 residues
downstream of the mutation site. Expression of mRNA and of CDH3 protein
was reduced in the skin of these patients.

.0002
HYPOTRICHOSIS, CONGENITAL, WITH JUVENILE MACULAR DYSTROPHY
CDH3, ARG503HIS

In a family with hypotrichosis with juvenile macular dystrophy (601553),
Indelman et al. (2002) found a homozygous G-to-A transition at
nucleotide 1508 in exon 11 of the CDH3 gene, resulting in a substitution
of his for arg at position 503 of the P-cadherin sequence (R503H). The
amino acid substitution affected a highly conserved residue and was
predicted to alter a Ca(2+)-binding domain of P-cadherin. This was the
first pathogenic missense mutation reported in CDH3.

.0003
ECTODERMAL DYSPLASIA, ECTRODACTYLY, AND MACULAR DYSTROPHY
CDH3, ASN322ILE

In affected individuals with ectodermal dysplasia, ectrodactyly, and
macular dystrophy (225280) from the consanguineous Danish family
previously reported by Albrectsen and Svendsen (1956), Kjaer et al.
(2005) identified homozygosity for a 965A-T transversion in exon 8 of
the CDH3 gene, resulting in an asn322-to-ile (N322I) substitution in a
highly conserved motif predicted to affect Ca(2+) binding and to alter
specificity of the cell-cell binding function. The unaffected
first-cousin parents were both heterozygous for the mutation.

.0004
ECTODERMAL DYSPLASIA, ECTRODACTYLY, AND MACULAR DYSTROPHY
CDH3, 1-BP DEL, 829G

In an affected individual with ectodermal dysplasia, ectrodactyly, and
macular dystrophy (225280) from the Brazilian family previously reported
by Balarin Silva et al. (1999), Kjaer et al. (2005) identified
homozygosity for a 1-bp deletion (829delG) in exon 7 of the CDH3 gene,
introducing a frameshift and a premature stop codon at residue 295,
predicted to result in a nonfunctional protein lacking both its
intracellular and membrane-spanning domains and its extracellular
cadherin repeats 3-5. The parents, a brother, and a son of the proband
were all heterozygous for the mutation. The brother exhibited minimal
symptoms, having mild bilateral syndactyly between fingers 1, 2, 3, and
4 and small, widely spaced teeth, but an unremarkable ophthalmologic and
hair examination.

610203	TITLE *610203 CYSTEINE-RICH INHIBITOR OF PAK1; CRIPAK
;;FLJ34443
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CRIPAK is a negative regulator of PAK1 (602590) that is upregulated by
estrogen (Talukder et al., 2006).

CLONING

By yeast 2-hybrid screening of a mammary gland cDNA expression library
to identify PAK1-interacting proteins, Talukder et al. (2006) cloned
CRIPAK. The predicted 446-amino acid protein contains an N-terminal C4
zinc finger domain, followed by 12 C3H zinc finger domains. Northern
blot analysis detected wide expression of CRIPAK, with highest levels in
trachea, prostate, and adrenal gland. RT-PCR revealed CRIPAK expression
in all cancer cell lines examined. Confocal microscopy of transfected
breast cancer cells showed that CRIPAK had a predominant cytoplasmic and
membrane localization; in some areas, CRIPAK partially colocalized with
PAK1.

GENE FUNCTION

Using GST pull-down and coimmunoprecipitation analyses, Talukder et al.
(2006) confirmed the interaction between CRIPAK and PAK1. Mutational
analysis defined the binding regions as amino acids 132 to 270 of PAK1
and amino acids 367 to 446 of CRIPAK. Kinase assays showed that CRIPAK
was not a substrate of PAK1, and CRIPAK inhibited both PAK1-mediated
protein phosphorylation and autophosphorylation in vitro and
intracellularly. Luciferase analysis revealed that CRIPAK inhibited both
PAK1-dependent and -independent activation of estrogen receptor (ESR1;
133430). Confocal microscopy showed that, in the presence of estrogen,
CRIPAK localization shifted from the cytoplasm to the nuclear
compartment, where it colocalized with ESR. During small interfering
RNA-mediated downregulation of CRIPAK, PAK1 activity increased. Talukder
et al. (2006) concluded that CRIPAK is upregulated by hormones and that
it negatively regulates PAK1 kinase activity.

GENE STRUCTURE

Talukder et al. (2006) determined that the CRIPAK gene is intronless.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Talukder et al. (2006) mapped the CRIPAK
gene to chromosome 4p16.3.

612316	TITLE *612316 ATPase FAMILY, AAA DOMAIN-CONTAINING, MEMBER 3A; ATAD3A
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ATAD3A and ATAD3B (612317) are mitochondrial membrane proteins that
contribute to the stabilization of large mitochondrial DNA
(mtDNA)-protein complexes called nucleoids (He et al., 2007).

CLONING

Using mass spectroscopy to identify cell surface antigens on myeloid
cell lines, followed by RT-PCR of promyelocytic cell line RNA, Geuijen
et al. (2005) cloned ATAD3A. Western blot analysis detected ATAD3A at an
apparent molecular mass of 75 kD in transfected human embryonic kidney
(HEK293T) cells. Flow cytometry revealed ATAD3A on the cell surface of a
promyelocytic cell line, on 77% of AML (601626) samples, on half of
monocytes, and on a subpopulation of dendritic cells, but not on other
lymphocytes. ATAD3A was not expressed on the surface of transfected
HEK293T cells.

By searching for sequences similar to rat Atad3, He et al. (2007)
identified human ATAD3A and ATAD3B. In its C-terminal half, the deduced
587-amino acid ATAD3A protein contains Walker A and B motifs, followed
by ATP-binding sensor-1 and sensor-2 motifs. An alpha helix is located
N-terminal to the Walker A motif, and an arginine finger separates the
sensor motifs. An antibody that did not differentiate between ATAD3A and
ATAD3B detected ATAD3 in a punctate pattern within mitochondria of human
osteosarcoma cells. The pattern frequently coincided with
mtDNA-containing nucleoids, but not all nucleoids contained ATAD3.

Bogenhagen et al. (2008) stated that ATAD3A contains a central
transmembrane domain. Using immunofluorescence and protease
susceptibility studies, they found that ATAD3A was embedded in the inner
membrane of HeLa cell mitochondria, with the C-terminal AAA domain
directed toward the matrix and the N terminus exposed to the cytoplasm.

GENE FUNCTION

He et al. (2007) found that depletion of ATAD3 via small interfering RNA
in human osteosarcoma cells led to increased negative supercoiling of
mtDNA, although mitochondria maintained essentially normal morphology.

Bogenhagen et al. (2008) found that, although both ATAD3A and ATAD3B
were present in native HeLa cell nucleoids, neither ATAD3 protein was
crosslinked with mtDNA in isolated formaldehyde crosslinked HeLa cell
nucleoids, indicating that they are unlikely to bind mtDNA. In addition,
protease susceptibility studies suggested that the putative N-terminal
DNA-binding regions of ATAD3A and ATAD3B reside outside the
mitochondrial inner membrane.

MAPPING

Bogenhagen et al. (2008) stated that the ATAD3 locus is tandemly
duplicated in humans, generating 2 paralogs, ATAD3A and ATAD3B. The
ATAD3 genes are located on chromosome 1p36.33 (Schaffrik et al., 2006).

608792	TITLE *608792 GIPC PDZ DOMAIN-CONTAINING FAMILY, MEMBER 3; GIPC3
;;GAIP C-TERMINUS-INTERACTING PROTEIN 3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By genomic sequence analysis and RT-PCR of fetal lung RNA, Saitoh et al.
(2002) obtained a full-length cDNA encoding GIPC3. The predicted
312-amino acid protein contains an N-terminal GIPC homology domain
(GH1), a central PDZ domain, and a C-terminal GH2 domain. GIPC3 shares
59.9% amino acid identity with GIPC1 (605072), 55.3% identity with
GIPC2, and 57.2% identity with Xenopus Kermit. Northern blot analysis
detected nearly ubiquitous expression of a 4.5-kb GIPC3 transcript, with
highest expression in small intestine. RNA dot blot analysis showed
highest GIPC3 expression in jejunum, lymph node, parietal lobe, fetal
spleen, and fetal thymus. Northern blot analysis detected GIPC3
expression in cervical, melanoma, and chronic myelogenous leukemia
cancer cell lines and in 2 of 7 gastric cancer cell lines examined.

GENE STRUCTURE

Saitoh et al. (2002) determined that the GIPC3 gene contains 6 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Saitoh et al. (2002) mapped the GIPC3 gene
to chromosome 19p13.3.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of an Indian and a Dutch family with autosomal
recessive sensorineural deafness of prelingual onset (DFNB15; 601869),
Charizopoulou et al. (2011) identified 2 different homozygous mutations
in the GIPC3 gene (L262R, 608792.0001 and W301X, 608792.0002,
respectively). The gene was chosen for study after Charizopoulou et al.
(2011) found that a mutation in the murine gene Gipc3 was responsible
for autosomal recessive deafness in the mouse (see ANIMAL MODEL).

Rehman et al. (2011) identified 7 different homozygous mutations,
including 1 frameshift and 6 missense, in the GIPC3 gene (see, e.g.,
601869.0003-601869.0006) in affected members of 7 unrelated
consanguineous Pakistani families with autosomal recessive nonsyndromic
deafness, including 2 families with DFNB72 previously been reported by
Ain et al. (2007). All but 1 of the mutations (R189C; 601869.0006) was
located in the GH1 or GH2 domains.

ANIMAL MODEL

By positional cloning of a mouse model (ahl5) of autosomal recessive
early-onset age-related hearing loss, Charizopoulou et al. (2011)
identified a homozygous G115R mutation in exon 2 of the Gipc3 gene,
affecting the PDZ domain of the protein. Mutation in the Gipc3 gene was
also found to underlie the murine juvenile audiogenic monogenic seizure
(jams1) phenotype, in which affected mice show seizure susceptibility
early in life that disappears with age. The G115R mutation caused a
reduction of the Gipc3 protein. Histopathologic studies of mutant mice
showed irregular structure of the stereocilia bundle of outer and inner
hair cells, and late-onset degeneration of the organ of Corti starting
at the base and progressing towards the apex. Concomitantly, the spiral
ganglion exhibited a severe loss of neurons that was most obvious at the
base and the mid-apical region of the cochlea. These data suggest that
Gipc3 is required for postnatal maturation of the hair bundle and
long-term survival of hair cells and spiral ganglion. Mutant mice showed
defects in mechanotransduction in both inner and outer hair cells that
was associated with defects in potassium channel activity. Audiogenic
seizure susceptibility and later resistance correlated with increased
and subsequent decline of the amplitude of audiogenic brainstem
responses. In wildtype mice, Gipc3 was localized to the cytoplasm of
inner and outer hair cells, cochlear spiral ganglion neurons, vestibular
hair cells, and vestibular ganglion neurons.

et al. (2011) identified a homozygous 785T-G transversion in exon 5 of
the GIPC3 gene, resulting in a leu262-to-arg (L262R) substitution in a

Charizopoulou et al. (2011) identified a homozygous 903G-A transition in
exon 6 of the GIPC3 gene, resulting in a trp301-to-ter (W301X)

610740	TITLE *610740 TRINUCLEOTIDE REPEAT-CONTAINING GENE 6B; TNRC6B
;;KIAA1093
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Kikuno et al. (1999) cloned TNRC6B, which they designated
KIAA1093. The deduced 1,203-amino acid protein contains an RNA
recognition motif. RT-PCR ELISA detected moderate expression in all
tissues and specific brain regions examined, with highest expression in
cerebellum.

Schneider et al. (2006) stated that the 1,727-amino acid TNRC6B protein
contains a glycine/tryptophan (GW)-rich N-terminal domain, a central
glutamine-rich region, and a C-terminal RNA recognition motif.

GENE FUNCTION

Meister et al. (2005) found that TNRC6B copurified with a cytoplasmic
HeLa cell protein complex containing AGO2 (EIF2C2; 606229), DICER
(606241), and MOV10 (610742). Epitope-tagged TNRC6B coimmunoprecipitated
with tagged AGO1 (EIF2C1; 606228) and tagged AGO2. TNRC6B was required
to mediate microRNA-guided mRNA cleavage in HeLa cell culture.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Kikuno et al. (1999) mapped the TNRC6B
gene to chromosome 22.

612812	TITLE *612812 PROFILIN 3; PFN3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the profilin family of actin-binding proteins (see PFN1;
176610), including PFN3, are key regulators of actin dynamics in living
cells (Braun et al., 2002).

CLONING

By database analysis using the rat Pfn3 cDNA as query, Braun et al.
(2002) identified human and mouse PFN3. The deduced 137-amino acid human
protein shares 89% amino acid identity with the mouse protein. Northern
blot analysis and RT-PCR of mouse tissues and testis detected Pfn3
expression in testis only. In situ hybridization of mouse testis
detected Pfn3 expression specifically in spermatocytes in the last
stages of spermatogenesis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Braun et al. (2002) determined that the PFN3 gene contains a single
exon. It is in head-to-head orientation with the SLC34A1 gene (182309),
which is on the opposite strand.

MAPPING

By database analysis, Braun et al. (2002) mapped the PFN3 gene to
chromosome 5q35.2.

300160	TITLE *300160 DEAD/H BOX 3, X-LINKED; DDX3X
;;DDX3;;
DBX
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

DEAD box proteins are putative RNA helicases that have a characteristic
asp-glu-ala-asp (DEAD) box as 1 of 8 highly conserved sequence motifs.
Chung et al. (1995) cloned cDNAs encoding DDX3, a member of the DEAD box
protein family.

Lahn and Page (1997) identified DDX3, which they called DBX, as 1 of 5
X-linked genes that have homologs located in the nonrecombining region
of the Y chromosome (NRY). They determined that these 5 X-linked genes
escape X inactivation. Lahn and Page (1997) postulated that these 5
genes are cases in which gene expression is maintained at comparable
levels in males and females by preservation of homologous genes on both
the X and the NRY, with male and female cells expressing both copies of
each gene. Sequence analysis revealed that DBX shares 91% protein
sequence identity with DBY (400010), the Y-linked homolog.

GENE FUNCTION

A single transcript in its unspliced and spliced forms directs synthesis
of all human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 proteins. Although nuclear
export of intron-containing cellular transcripts is restricted in
mammalian cells, HIV-1 has evolved the viral Rev protein to overcome
this restriction for viral transcripts. CRM1 (XPO1; 602559) is a
cellular cofactor for Rev-dependent export of intron-containing HIV-1
RNA. Yedavalli et al. (2004) presented evidence that Rev/CRM1 activity
uses the ATP-dependent RNA helicase DDX3. They showed that DDX3 is a
nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein that binds CRM1 and localizes to
nuclear membrane pores. Knockdown of DDX3 using either antisense vector
or dominant-negative mutants suppressed Rev-RRE (Rev response element)
function in the export of incompletely spliced HIV-1 RNAs. Yedavalli et
al. (2004) concluded that DDX3 is the human RNA helicase that functions
in the CRM1 RNA export pathway analogously to the postulated role for
Dbp5 (605812) in yeast mRNA export.

Cruciat et al. (2013) identified the DEAD box RNA helicase DDX3 as a
regulator of the Wnt (see 164820)-beta-catenin (116806) network, where
it acts as a regulatory subunit of CK1-epsilon (600863): in a
Wnt-dependent manner, DDX3 binds CK1-epsilon and directly stimulates its
kinase activity, and promotes phosphorylation of the scaffold protein
dishevelled (see 601365). DDX3 is required for Wnt-beta-catenin
signaling in mammalian cells and during Xenopus and C. elegans
development. Cruciat et al. (2013) concluded that their results
suggested that the kinase-stimulatory function extends to other DDX and
CK1 members.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Park et al. (1998) mapped the
DDX3X gene to Xp11.3-p11.23.

185641	TITLE *185641 MEDIATOR COMPLEX SUBUNIT 22; MED22
;;SURFEIT 5; SURF5
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MED22, or SURF5, is a component of the Mediator complex, which is a
coactivator for DNA-binding factors that activate transcription via RNA
polymerase II (Sato et al., 2003). For background information on the
surfeit genes, see SURF1 (185620).

CLONING

Garson et al. (1996) stated that the mouse Surf5 protein contains 140
amino acids and is 98.5% identical to the human SURF5 protein. By
screening mouse brain and human fetal brain cDNA libraries, they cloned
a splice variant of SURF5 that they called SURF5B. Both mouse and human
SURF5B encode a deduced 200-amino acid protein that is identical to
SURF5 over the first 137 amino acids. Northern blot analysis detected
Surf5 expression in all mouse tissues examined, whereas expression of
Surf5b was restricted to brain, heart, testis, and skeletal muscle. Both
mouse proteins were recovered in the cytoplasmic fraction of transfected
cells.

By PCR of a human teratocarcinoma cell line cDNA library, Angiolillo et
al. (2002) obtained 3 splice variants of SURF5. The longest cDNA,
SURF5a, encodes a deduced 140-amino acid protein with a calculated
molecular mass of 16.7 kD. SURF5b encodes a deduced 200-amino acid
protein with a calculated molecular mass of 21 kD. The first 137 amino
acids of both proteins are identical. Northern blot analysis of human
tissues detected a 2.7-kb SURF5a transcript in all tissues and cell
lines examined. A 1.4-kb SURF5b transcript was detected only in heart,
brain, skeletal muscle, and pancreas, and in human teratocarcinoma
cells. Fluorescence-tagged SURF5a and SURF5b localized predominantly to
the cytoplasm of transfected HeLa cells.

Using HeLa cells overexpressing epitope-tagged MED10 (612382), Sato et
al. (2003) purified several components of the human Mediator complex,
including MED22, which they called SURF5, and subsequently cloned the
corresponding cDNA.

GENE FUNCTION

Garson et al. (1996) found that both mouse Surf5 and Surf5b were
expressed in undifferentiated mouse teratocarcinoma cells, but that
expression of Surf5b was upregulated 4-fold following their
differentiation into neuronal cells.

Using in vitro-translated epitope-tagged proteins for protein-binding
assays, Sato et al. (2003) found SURF5 directly interacted with the
Mediator complex subunits TRAP25 (MED30; 610237), HSPC296 (MED11;
612383), TRAP80 (MED17; 603810), and TRAP37 (MED27; 605044). Formation
of the SURF5-HSPC296 and SURF5-TRAP25 heterodimers were confirmed by
coimmunoprecipitation analysis of cotransfected insect cells and E.
coli, respectively.

GENE STRUCTURE

Angiolillo et al. (2002) determined that the MED22 gene contains 5 exons
and spans about 7.5 kb. The transcription start sites of the MED22 and
SURF3 (RPL7A; 185640) genes are separated by a 110-bp region that showed
bidirectional promoter activity. This promoter region lacks a TATA box
but is characterized by a CpG island that extends through the first exon
into the first intron of both genes.

MAPPING

By FISH analysis, Yon et al. (1993) identified the MED22 gene within the
surfeit gene cluster in chromosome 9q34.

480000	TITLE *480000 SEX-DETERMINING REGION Y; SRY
;;TESTIS-DETERMINING FACTOR; TDF;;
TESTIS-DETERMINING FACTOR ON Y; TDY
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SRY encodes a transcription factor that is a member of the high mobility
group (HMG)-box family of DNA binding proteins.

CLONING

Sinclair et al. (1990) identified a gene, which they named SRY
(sex-determining region Y), within a 35-kb sex-determining region on the
human Y chromosome that was adjacent to the pseudoautosomal boundary.
The mouse homolog Sry was subsequently cloned and found to be present in
Sxr-prime mice, which have the smallest part of the Y chromosome known
to be sex-determining (Gubbay et al., 1990). Furthermore, Sry was
deleted from a mutant Y chromosome that was no longer sex-determining
(Gubbay et al., 1990).

Su and Lau (1993) found that the SRY open reading frame encodes a
deduced 204-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 24
kD. There is a DNA-binding HMG motif in the middle of the protein.

Capel et al. (1993) found that a circular Sry transcript consisting of a
single exon represented more than 90% of Sry transcripts in adult mouse
testis. In contrast, developing mouse genital ridge exclusively
expressed linear Sry transcripts. Circular Sry transcripts were not
detected in any other mouse tissue examined and were most likely
noncoding. Capel et al. (1993) noted that the human SRY gene is
transcribed into a linear form only and lacks the flanking inverted
repeats required for circular splicing.

GENOTYPE

Goodfellow and Lovell-Badge (1993) provided a major review of SRY and
sex determination in mammals.

From the study of normal males and females, persons with abnormal
numbers of sex chromosomes, and persons carrying variant Y chromosomes,
a factor (or factors) that determines the differentiation of the
indifferent gonads into testes is known to be located on the Y
chromosome and specifically on the short arm; this was designated
testis-determining factor (TDF) in the 1960s. (See Mendelian Inheritance
in Man, 4th ed., fig. 1, p. lix, 1975.)

Mittwoch (1992) argued that the 'dogma' that all differences
distinguishing male and female mammals can be traced to the presence or
absence of a single gene encoding a testis-determining factor lacks, as
she said, 'biological validity.' She suggested that the genotype of the
functional, i.e., fertile, male differs from that of a functional female
by the presence of multiple Y-chromosomal genes in association with but
a single X chromosome.

GENE FUNCTION

Lahr et al. (1995) used RT-PCR to investigate the transcription of the
Sry gene in mice. The gene was transcribed in the hypothalamus,
midbrain, and testis of adult male but not adult female mice. Whereas
the transcripts in the adult testis were circular, those in brain were
linear and therefore capable of translation. Lahr et al. (1995)
hypothesized that some male specific properties of the brain may be
generated directly by the SRY gene product.

With use of reporter plasmids, gel shift assays, and transfection
experiments, Hossain and Saunders (2001) determined that the product of
the WT1 gene (607102) transactivates SRY by binding to its promoter
region. They also found that WT1 carrying any of 4 common mutations
causing Denys-Drash syndrome failed to activate the SRY promoter.

Li et al. (2001) found that the R133W SRY mutation (607102.0019), which
lies within the HMG DNA-binding domain, had little or no effect on
specific DNA binding and bending assays, but resulted in a significant
change in cellular location of SRY upon transfection into COS-7 cells
and into a male rat gonadal ridge embryogenic cell line. In both model
cell systems, wildtype SRY localized to the nuclear compartment, whereas
the mutant SRY showed a broad distribution in the cytoplasm and nucleus
similar to that observed with deletion of the C-terminal nuclear
localization signal (NLS).

Sekido and Lovell-Badge (2008) demonstrated that Sry binds to multiple
elements within a Sox9 (608160) gonad-specific enhancer that they called
TESCO (testis-specific enhancer of Sox9 core) in mice, and that it does
so along with steroidogenic factor-1 (SF1) an orphan nuclear receptor
encoded by the gene Nr5a1 (184757). Mutation, cotransfection, and
sex-reversal studies all pointed to a feedforward, self-reinforcing
pathway in which SF1 and SRY cooperatively upregulate SOX9; then,
together with SF1, SOX9 also binds to the enhancer to help maintain its
own expression after that of SRY has ceased. Sekido and Lovell-Badge
(2008) concluded that their results permitted further characterization
of the molecular mechanisms regulating sex determination, their
evolution, and the failure of these mechanisms in cases of sex reversal.

Hansen et al. (2013) found that the mouse Sry circular RNA contains 16
putative microRNA-138 (MIR138; see 613394)-binding sites. They showed
that Sry bound Mir138 and functioned as an Mir138 sponge, reducing the
ability of Mir138 to downregulate expression of a reporter gene.

GENE STRUCTURE

Su and Lau (1993) determined that SRY is an intronless gene that spans
3.8 kb. Analysis of the proximal flanking region revealed 2 GC-rich
regions containing several Sp1 (189906)-binding sites. The gene also
contains a TATAAA motif for the binding of TFIID (TAF5; 601787) and a
kappa B enhancer element for the binding of NF-kappa-B (see 164011).

MAPPING

TDF was ultimately mapped to the human Y chromosome by molecular
examination of sex-reversed patients. Analysis of 4 XX males with testes
who had minute portions of the Y material translocated to the X
chromosome was critical in defining the sex-determining region on the
human Y chromosome (Palmer et al., 1989; Sinclair et al., 1990). The
sex-determining region on the human Y chromosome was later defined to a
35-kb region of Y-specific DNA adjacent to the pseudoautosomal boundary
(Sinclair et al., 1990).

Behlke et al. (1993) found that 2 RNAs hybridized to a 4,741-bp genomic
segment of the sex-determining region of the human Y chromosome: one
transcript deriving from SRY, and a second transcript cross-hybridizing
to a pseudogene located 2.5 kb 5-prime of the SRY open reading frame.
Analysis of the SRY transcript suggested that the entire SRY protein is
encoded by a single exon.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- 46,XY Complete Gonadal Dysgenesis

Jager et al. (1990) analyzed the SRY gene in 12 XY sex-reversed females
(400044) and identified a de novo 4-bp deletion (480000.0001) in a
conserved DNA-binding motif in 1 patient.

Hawkins et al. (1992) studied the SRY gene in 5 phenotypic females with
complete gonadal dysgenesis and a 46,XY karyotype reported by Berkovitz
et al. (1991). They used single-strand conformation polymorphism assay
and DNA sequencing to screen the open reading frame and identified
mutations in 3 of the 5 patients. Like all the previously described SRY
mutations, these mutations--2 point mutations (480000.0006 and
480000.0007) and a single-base deletion (480000.0008)--altered the
putative DNA-binding region of the SRY protein.

Hawkins (1993) performed a mutation analysis of the SRY gene in XY
females. He noted that 11 mutations had been described at that time, and
all were within the DNA-binding HMG-box region of the protein.

Cameron and Sinclair (1997) stated that 26 different mutations in the
SRY gene have been found in individuals with a 46,XY karyotype. They
cited reports stating that no polymorphisms had been described in SRY
among 50 normal males. De novo mutations in the SRY HMG-box region
almost always resulted in 46,XY unambiguous females with no testicular
differentiation. They found 5 reports of familial 46,XY complete gonadal
dysgenesis associated with mutations in the SRY HMG-box region. In 4 of
these reports, the father carried the same SRY mutation as his 46,XY
daughter. None of the mutations appeared to be polymorphisms.
Explanations for the sex reversal associated with these familial SRY
mutations included paternal gonadal mosaicism for the mutation (yet to
be proven) and incomplete penetrance of the mutation. Support for a
penetrance effect came from murine studies in which at least 3 autosomal
recessive alleles were found to interact with Y-chromosome alleles,
resulting in the genesis of XY ovaries and true hermaphrodites (Eicher
and Washburn, 1986). Cameron and Sinclair (1997) noted that timing and
expression of SRY are exquisitely regulated and probably must reach a
threshold. Consequently, a given mutation in SRY against a particular
genetic background might produce sufficient SRY expression to reach the
threshold required; testis formation can then ensue, accounting for an
unaffected father.

Uehara et al. (2002) found missense mutations in the SRY gene in 2 of 3
patients with the complete form of XY gonadal dysgenesis. Combined with
the results of a previous study (Uehara et al., 1999) in which 2 of 3
complete-type patients showed SRY abnormalities, the incidence was
estimated at 67%, which is higher than previously thought. A
metaanalysis of patients with SRY abnormalities showed an incidence of
52.5% for gonadal tumor formation in patients with SRY abnormalities.
Uehara et al. (2002) gave a useful tabulation of the SRY abnormalities
that had been described.

Harley et al. (2003) examined the SRY gene from 4 XY females, each with
a missense mutation of a conserved arginine in either 1 of the 2 NLSs of
the SRY HMG box. In all cases, mutant SRY protein was partly localized
to the cytoplasm, whereas wildtype SRY was strictly nuclear. Each NLS
can independently direct nuclear transport of a carrier protein in vitro
and in vivo, with mutations in either affecting the rate and extent of
nuclear accumulation. The N-terminal NLS function is independent of the
conventional NLS-binding importins and requires cytoplasmic transport
factors, whereas the C-terminal NLS is recognized by importin-beta
(KPNB1; 602738). The SRY mutant R133W (480000.0019) showed reduced
importin-beta binding as a direct consequence of the sex-reversing
C-terminal NLS mutation. Of the 3 other N-terminal NLS mutants examined,
1 unexpectedly showed a marked reduction in importin-beta binding,
whereas the other 2 showed normal importin-beta binding, suggesting
defects in the importin-independent pathway. Harley et al. (2003)
concluded that SRY normally requires the 2 distinct NLS-dependent
nuclear import pathways to reach sufficient levels in the nucleus for
sex determination. The study documented cases of human disease that were
explained, at a molecular level, by the impaired ability of a protein to
accumulate in the nucleus.

- 46,XY True Hermaphroditism

Braun et al. (1993) reported a 46,XY true hermaphrodite who had a
mutation of SRY in gonadal DNA but not in leukocyte DNA, suggesting that
the mutation was postzygotic. Because of this finding, Fuqua et al.
(1997) attempted to determine whether postzygotic mutations of SRY might
explain the numerous cases of gonadal dysgenesis in which no SRY
mutation was detected in leukocyte DNA. They evaluated 16 subjects with
46,XY gonadal dysgenesis who had a normal SRY sequence in leukocyte DNA,
5 of them having 46,XY complete gonadal dysgenesis. They did not find
mutations in gonadal DNA from any of 16 subjects and concluded that
postzygotic mutations of SRY are a rare cause of 46,XY gonadal
dysgenesis.

Maier et al. (2003) reported a 46,XY true hermaphrodite who had a
mutation in the SRY gene (480000.0014). The father, his 3 brothers, and
his first-born son carried the identical mutation without phenotypic
effects. Maier et al. (2003) concluded that the mutated protein retained
enough activity to allow normal development in some individuals.

- 46,XX Gonadal Dysgenesis, Complete or Partial

Margarit et al. (2000) studied a 46,XX true hermaphrodite and found that
Yp-specific sequences, including the SRY gene, had been transferred to
the long arm of one of the X chromosomes at the Xq28 level. The
derivative X chromosome of the patient lacked q-telomeric sequences. The
authors suggested that this was the first report of a Yp/Xq
translocation. The coexistence of testicular and ovarian tissue in the
patient may have arisen by differential inactivation of the Y-bearing X
chromosome, in which Xq telomeric sequences were missing.

Sharp et al. (2005) studied causes of incomplete masculinization in 15
individuals with segments of Yp translocated onto Xp. Expression studies
showed little evidence for the spreading of X inactivation into Yp
chromatin; however, in several cases, disruption of gene expression
occurred independently of X inactivation, suggesting position effects
resulting from chromosomal rearrangement. In particular, 5 of 6
translocation carriers with an intersex phenotype had either
translocation breakpoints very close to SRY, or disrupted expression of
genes near SRY in a manner unrelated to X inactivation. Southern blot
analysis suggested the presence of a cryptic rearrangement 3 to 8 kb
proximal to SRY in 1 case. Sharp et al. (2005) suggested that incomplete
masculinization in cases of X/Y translocation is a result of disruption
of normal SRY expression by position effects rather than X inactivation.

Zenteno et al. (1997) described a Mexican family in which 2 brothers,
aged 28 and 26, were thought to be instances of 'classic' XX males
without genital ambiguity but were found to be negative for several
Y-chromosome sequences, including SRY. The data suggested that an
inherited loss-of-function mutation in a gene participating in the
sex-determining cascade can induce normal male sexual differentiation in
the absence of SRY.

- Mosaicism

Shahid et al. (2005) performed molecular genetics studies in 3 Turner
syndrome patients all presenting with 45,X/46,XY mosaic karyotype. Two
patients carried mutations within the HMG box, and 1 patient carried a
frameshift mutation downstream of the HMG box. The authors suggested
that lack of a second sex chromosome in a majority of cells (mosaic
karyotype and mutation in the SRY gene) in these patients may have
triggered the short stature.

Lange et al. (2009) identified 60 unrelated individuals with
isodicentric (idic) or isocentromeric (iso) Y chromosomes, 51 of which
apparently arose via a palindromic mechanism, yielding an idicYp in 49
cases and an idicYq in 2 cases, whereas the remaining 9 arose via
recombination in heterochromatic sequences, yielding an idicYp in 2
cases and an isoYp in 7 cases. As expected, the 2 individuals carrying
the idicYq chromosomes lacked the SRY gene and were phenotypic females;
however, 18 of the 58 idicYp and isoYp individuals, who had 2 copies of
SRY, were also 'sex-reversed' and raised as females or found in
childhood to have 1 degenerate ovary and 1 testis. Lange et al. (2009)
observed that the average intercentromeric distance in the feminized
individuals was twice that in the males (p less than 10(-6)), supporting
the hypothesis that mitotic instability and resultant XO mosaicism may
cause sex reversal.

EVOLUTION

Using a human SRY probe, Foster et al. (1992) identified and cloned
related genes from the Y chromosome of 2 marsupial species. Comparisons
of eutherian ('placental') and metatherian (marsupial) Y-located SRY
sequences suggested rapid evolution of these genes, especially outside
the region encoding the DNA-binding 'high mobility group' domain (HMG
box). The SRY homolog and the homolog of the mouse Ube1y were the first
genes to be identified on the marsupial Y chromosome. Whitfield et al.
(1993) and Tucker and Lundrigan (1993) likewise found that whereas the
central 'high mobility group' domain of about 78 amino acids of the SRY
protein is highly conserved, evolution in primates and in mice and rats
has been rapid in the regions flanking the conserved domain. The high
degree of sequence divergence and the frequency of nonsynonymous
mutations suggested either that the majority of the coding sequence has
no functional significance and therefore is not functionally constrained
or that it has been subject to directional selection with
species-specific adaptive divergence.

Foster and Graves (1994) identified a sequence on the marsupial X
chromosome that shares homology with SRY and shows near-identity with
the mouse and human SOX3 gene (313430; formerly called a3), the SOX gene
most closely related to SRY. Foster and Graves (1994) suggested that the
highly conserved X chromosome-linked SOX3 represents the ancestral SOX
gene from which the sex-determining SRY gene was derived.

In therian mammals (placentals and marsupials), sex is determined by an
XX female:XY male system in which the SRY gene on the Y chromosome
affects male determination. Birds have a ZW female:ZZ male system with
no homology with mammalian sex chromosomes. In birds, dosage of a
Z-borne gene, possibly DMRT1 (602424), affects male determination.
Platypus employ a sex-determining system of 5 X and 5 Y chromosomes.
Females have 2 copies of the 5 Xs; males have 5X and 5Y chromosomes,
which form an alternating XY chain during male meiosis. Veyrunes et al.
(2008) found no homology between the 10 platypus sex chromosomes and the
ancestral therian X chromosome, which is homologous to platypus
chromosome 6. Orthologs of genes in the conserved region of human X
(including SOX3, the gene from which SRY evolved) all map to platypus
chromosome 6, which therefore represents the ancestral autosome from
which the therian X and Y pair derived. The platypus X chromosomes have
substantial homology with the bird Z chromosome (including DMRT1), and
to segments syntenic with this region in the human genome. Veyrunes et
al. (2008) concluded that the therian X and Y chromosomes, including the
SRY gene, evolved from an autosomal pair after the divergence of
monotremes only 166 million years ago.

Hughes et al. (2010) finished sequencing the male-specific region of the
Y chromosome (MSY) in chimpanzee, achieving levels of accuracy and
completion previously reached for the human MSY. Comparison of the MSYs
of the 2 species showed that they differ radically in sequence structure
and gene content, indicating rapid evolution during the past 6 million
years. The chimpanzee MSY contains twice as many massive palindromes as
the human MSY, yet it has lost large fractions of the MSY protein-coding
genes and gene families present in the last common ancestor. Hughes et
al. (2010) suggested that the extraordinary divergence of the chimpanzee
and human MSYs was driven by 4 synergistic factors: the prominent role
of the MSY in sperm production, 'genetic hitchhiking' effects in the
absence of meiotic crossingover, frequent ectopic recombination within
the MSY, and species differences in mating behavior.

ANIMAL MODEL

The human and mouse Sry genes share 89% amino acid identity in their HMG
box domains, but they diverge significantly in their C termini. Coward
et al. (1994) found that Sry alleles from all mouse strains examined
encode a glutamine- and histidine-rich C-terminal domain. Sry alleles
encoding a polyglutamine tract of either 13 or 11 glutamine residues
were associated with partial (fetal) or complete sex reversal,
respectively, when introduced on a C57BL/6J background. Alleles encoding
a tract of 12 glutamine residues were not associated with sex reversal.

Only the HMG box region of the SRY gene has been conserved through
evolution, suggesting that SRY function depends solely on the HMG box
and therefore acts as an architectural transcription factor. In mice,
SRY includes a large CAG trinucleotide repeat region encoding a
C-terminal glutamine-rich domain that acts as a transcriptional
trans-activator in vitro. The absence of this or any other potential
trans-activating domain in other mammals, however, has raised doubts as
to its biologic relevance. To test directly whether the glutamine-rich
region is required for SRY function in vivo Bowles et al. (1999) created
truncation mutations of the Mus musculus SRY gene and tested their
ability to induce testis formation in XX embryos using a transgenic
mouse assay. SRY constructs that encoded proteins lacking a
glutamine-rich region were unable to effect male sex determination, in
contrast to their wildtype counterparts. Bowles et al. (1999) concluded
that the glutamine-rich repeat domain of the mouse SRY protein has an
essential role in sex determination in vivo and that SRY may act via a
fundamentally different biochemical mechanism in mice compared with
other mammals.

Nef et al. (2003) demonstrated that the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase
family, comprising INSR (147670), IGF1R (147370), and IRR (147671), is
required for the appearance of male gonads and thus for male sexual
differentiation in mice. XY mice that were mutant for all 3 receptors
developed ovaries and showed a completely female phenotype. Reduced
expression of both Sry and the early testis-specific marker Sox9
(608160) indicated that the insulin signaling pathway is required for
male sex determination.

In 6 sterile heifers that were female in appearance and in genital
organs, Kawakura et al. (1996) found that blood, skin, spleen, and
kidney showed a normal male 60,XY karyotype. Although the SRY gene was
detected by PCR in a normal bulls, it was not detected in normal cows or
in 3 60,XY female bovine cases studied.

HISTORY

Page et al. (1987) cloned part or all of what they thought to be the TDF
gene, found that some sequences were highly conserved in mammals and
even birds, and showed that the nucleotide sequence of the conserved DNA
codes for zinc finger domains. ZFY (zinc finger protein, Y-linked;
314980) was the designation approved by the HGM workshop committee, with
ZFX being the X-linked counterpart. ZFY proved, however, not to be TDF
(Palmer et al., 1989).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
46,XY SEX REVERSAL 1
SRY, 4-BP DEL, NT773

Jager et al. (1990) demonstrated a mutation in SRY in 1 of 12
sex-reversed XY females with gonadal dysgenesis (400044) who had no
large deletions of the short arm of the Y chromosome. They found a 4-bp
deletion (nucleotides 773-776) in the part of the SRY gene that encodes
a conserved DNA-binding motif. A frameshift presumably led to a
nonfunctional protein. Mutation occurred de novo, because the father had
a normal SRY sequence. This provided strong evidence that SRY is TDF.
The de novo G-to-A mutation led to a change from methionine to
isoleucine. Hawkins (1993) noted that the mutation is in the HMG box of
SRY.

46,XY SEX REVERSAL 1
SRY, PHE109SER

In an XY female with gonadal dysgenesis (400044), her father, her 2
brothers and an uncle, Jager et al. (1992) found a T-to-C transition in
the region of the SRY gene coding for a protein motif known as the high
mobility group (HMG) box, a protein domain known to confer DNA-binding
specificity on the SRY protein. The mutation resulted in the
substitution, at amino acid position 109, of a serine residue for
phenylalanine, a conserved aromatic residue in almost all HMG box motifs
known. This F109S mutation was not found in 176 male controls. When
recombinant wildtype SRY and SRY(F109S) mutant protein were tested in
vitro for binding to the target site AAC AAAG, no differences in
DNA-binding activity were observed. These results implied that the F109S
mutation either is a rare neutral sequence variant, or produces an SRY
protein with slightly altered in vivo activity, the resulting sex
phenotype depending on the genetic background or environmental factors.
The proband had primary amenorrhea and was 180 cm tall. Prior to
therapy, mammary development was at stage III (Tanner). No signs of
virilization were found. At laparotomy, bilateral streak gonads,
atrophic fallopian tubes, and a rudimentary uterus with a narrow lumen
were detected. Although the paternal uncle with the F109S mutation had
an undescended right testis, the family was unremarkable with regard to
infertility, gynecologic tumors, and abnormal sex phenotypes.

46,XY SEX REVERSAL 1
SRY, VAL60LEU

Vilain et al. (1992) described a family in which all 5 XY individuals in
2 generations had a single basepair substitution resulting in an amino
acid change in the conserved domain of the SRY open reading frame. A
G-to-C transversion at nucleotide 588 resulted in substitution of
leucine for valine-60. Three of the individuals were XY sex-reversed
females (400044) and 2 were XY males. One of the males had 8 children;
all were phenotypic females, 2 of whom were the sex-reversed XY males
carrying the mutation mentioned. Several models were proposed to explain
association between a sequence variant in SRY and 2 alternative sex
phenotypes. These explanations included the existence of alleles at an
unlinked locus.

46,XY SEX REVERSAL 1
SRY, GLN93TER

McElreavey et al. (1992) described an XY sex-reversed female with pure
gonadal dysgenesis (400044) who harbored a de novo nonsense mutation in
SRY, which resulted directly in the formation of a stop codon in the
putative DNA-binding motif. A C-to-T transition at nucleotide 687
changed a glutamine codon (CAG) to a termination codon (TAG). The
patient, referred to by the authors as the 'propositus,' was a
phenotypic female who presented at age 20 years for primary amenorrhea.
Treatment with estrogen induced menstruation and slight enlargement of
the breasts which were underdeveloped. Laparotomy showed 2 streak gonads
without germ cells or remnants of tubes.

46,XY TRUE HERMAPHRODITISM, INCLUDED
SRY, ILE90MET

In 'patient 213' (patient 4 in the report of Berkovitz et al., 1991), a
phenotypic female with complete gonadal dysgenesis and a 46,XY karyotype
(400044), Hawkins et al. (1992) identified a C-G transversion at
nucleotide 680, causing an isoleucine-to-methionine amino acid
substitution within the HMG box. The father and brother of patient 213
also carried the mutation, which was not found in 78 ethnically matched
unrelated males. The authors noted that in vitro studies by Harley et
al. (1992) demonstrated that the I90M mutant had reduced DNA-binding
activity.

Dork et al. (1998) observed this mutation in a patient unrelated to that
reported by Hawkins et al. (1992). None of the previously reviewed
mutations had been observed in more than a single family. In 3 cases,
however, fertile fathers were found to share the same SRY mutation with
their sex-reversed daughters (Berta et al., 1990; Jager et al., 1992;
Vilain et al., 1992). In the absence of mosaicism, there are plausible
explanations for these familiar variants. The variant could fortuitously
occur in a family segregating for a different sex-reversing gene, or the
variant may predispose toward sex reversal and cause a differentiation
effect only in association with other genetic or environmental factors.
In the case reported by Hawkins et al. (1992), I90M was likewise
associated with complete gonadal dysgenesis in the proband but was also
present in normal relatives of the patient, including the father. Thus,
Dork et al. (1998) concluded that this appears to be an instance of a
Y-linked inherited disorder with incomplete penetrance and suggested
that identification of unrelated individuals carrying the I90M mutation
may help to elucidate the mechanism.

Maier et al. (2003) reported a 46,XY true hermaphrodite (400045) who had
the I90M mutation in the SRY gene. The father, 3 uncles, and an older
brother carried the identical mutation without phenotypic effects. Maier
et al. (2003) concluded that the mutated protein retained enough
activity to allow normal development in some individuals.

In their 'patient 207' (patient 5 of Berkovitz et al., 1991) with
complete gonadal dysgenesis and a 46,XY karyotype (400044), Hawkins et
al. (1992) identified an A-T transversion at nucleotide 727, resulting
in a lysine-to-isoleucine substitution within the HMG box.

In their 'patient 208' (patient 6 of Berkovitz et al., 1991) with

al. (1992) found deletion of nucleotide 734 causing a frameshift. The
father and brother of patient 208 did not share the deletion, indicating
that the mutation was de novo. Hawkins (1993) noted that the mutation is
in the HMG box of SRY.

SRY, ALA113THR

In a Chinese XY female with gonadal dysgenesis (Swyer syndrome; 400044),
Zeng et al. (1993) described a G-to-A transition in codon 113 resulting
in a change from alanine to threonine. This residue lies within the
putative DNA binding motif.

46,XY SEX REVERSAL 1
SRY, TRP107TER

Iida et al. (1994) identified a single basepair substitution within the
HMG box of the SRY gene in a 28-year-old married Japanese woman with a
history of primary amenorrhea and infertility. Physical examination
showed an apparently normal female with a weight of 62 kg and a height
of 170.5 cm. While the external genitalia were those of a female, they
were infantile with no hypertrophy of the clitoris. The vagina was
normal and a cervix was present. The uterus was normal in shape and
position. Laboratory examination demonstrated that the amenorrhea was
due to ovarian failure. There was no elevation of androgen levels. The
karyotype was 46,XY (400044). Both gonads were partially resected
because of the risk of malignant development and showed fibroadipose
tissue with no malignant cells and no ovarian or testicular components.
By single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis followed by direct
sequencing, Iida et al. (1994) demonstrated a GGT to GAT substitution in
codon 107, counted from the initiation site of the gene, which predicted
a change from a tryptophan residue to a termination codon.

.0011
46,XY SEX REVERSAL 1
SRY, ILE68THR

This mutation, which caused sex reversal in a female patient with a
46,XY karyotype (400044), was used by Haqq et al. (1994) to demonstrate
that the structural interactions of the HMG box with DNA was altered to
result in failure to induce transcription of the gene for mullerian
inhibiting substance. The normal protein-DNA interaction consists of
partial side chain intercalation into a widened minor groove.

Studying this same mutation, Peters et al. (1995) demonstrated that 2
DNA-binding activities of SRY could be distinguished. The
sequence-specific recognition of duplex DNA must be required for male
sex determination because it was eliminated by this mutation in the SRY
HMG box. However, the sequence-independent binding to the sharp angles
of 4-way DNA junctions was not affected.

SRY, MET64ILE

In an XY female (400044), Berta et al. (1990) identified a G-to-A

presumed to be de novo because it was not found in the patient's father
or brother.

Veitia et al. (1997) found a de novo recurrence of the C-to-T transition

at codon 133 was conserved in the SRY gene of all species studied at
that time.

.0020
46,XY SEX REVERSAL 1
SRY, GLN2TER

Brown et al. (1998) described a 28-year-old West Indian woman with the
primary complaint of infertility. She reported menarche and normal
breast development at age 13 to 14 years and had had regular monthly
menses until age 17 years, when she electively began oral
contraceptives, which she continued until age 25 years. Irregular menses
resumed with the discontinuation of oral contraception and for the 2
subsequent years she attempted to become pregnant. She had been treated
with clomiphene citrate for presumed anovulation. She appeared normally
feminized, and her physical examination, including her gynecological
examination, was entirely normal, except for the fact that she was 193
cm tall. Specifically, she was not hirsute and had no stigmata of Turner
syndrome. Breasts and pubic hair were Tanner stage 4. A chromosome
analysis showed a 46,XY karyotype (400044). At laparoscopy, the gonads
appeared to be white fibrous streaks and were removed without
difficulty. Study of all cells failed to detect any with either 2 X
chromosomes or without a Y chromosome. The excised gonad from the right
side consisted entirely of fibroadipose tissue; the left gonad contained
a small amount of ovarian stromal-like tissue. No follicles were seen;
however, a cluster of tubular structures was present. Fibroblast-like
cells cultured from both gonadal tissue samples also had a pure XY
karyotype. Analysis of the SRY gene revealed a C-to-T transition in the
second codon, predicted to create a stop codon (gln2ter). The same
mutation was found in the gonads of each side. There was no evidence of
mosaicism. The patient's father's SRY gene showed an entirely normal
sequence. Paternity was proved by the expected segregation of
polymorphic PCR-based markers.

A mouse with a heritable mutation in the testis-determining gene was
described by Lovell-Badge and Robertson (1990). XY mice with this
mutation are fertile females, although fertility is reduced and their
ovaries fail early, a picture similar to that in the patient reported by
Brown et al. (1998).

.0021
46,XY SEX REVERSAL 1
SRY, SER18ASN

In 1 of 21 Brazilian patients with 46,XY sex reversal (400044), Domenice
et al. (1998) found a ser18-to-asn (S18N) missense mutation upstream of
the 5-prime border of the HMG box of the SRY gene. The variant sequence
was also found in DNA obtained from blood and sperm of his father and in
blood cells of his normal brother. The S18N mutation was not found in 50
normal males, ruling out the possibility of a common polymorphism. The
patient had been evaluated at 4 years of age for ambiguous genitalia,
characterized by microphallus, perineal hypospadias, bifid scrotum, and
a gonad in the left inguinal region. His basal serum testosterone level
was 16 ng/dl rising to 189 ng/dl after hCG stimulation. Histologic study
showed a right streak gonad, a left dysgenic testis, and the presence of
both wolffian and mullerian ducts. His brother at 18 years of age had
normal male external genitalia with complete development of secondary
sexual characteristics. The father was a 43-year-old phenotypically
normal male.

Canto et al. (2000) performed molecular studies of the SRY gene in 3
patients with an Ullrich-Turner syndrome (see 163950) phenotype and
bilateral streaks; 2 were 45,X/46,XY mosaic, and the third had a Y
marker chromosome. In 2 of the patients, the authors identified an S18N
mutation in the 5-prime non-HMG box region in DNA from blood and both
streaks. This mutation was not identified in 5 normal males. Sequencing
of the DNA region was normal in the father and older brother of patient
1, demonstrating that in this patient the mutation was de novo. The
authors concluded that the previous report of a 46,XY patient with
partial gonadal dysgenesis and the same mutation indicates the probable
existence of a hotspot in this region of the SRY gene and strengthens
the possibility that all gonadal dysgeneses constitute a spectrum of the
same disorder. They also pointed out that this single genetic
abnormality can result in a wide range of phenotypic expression.

.0022
46,XY SEX REVERSAL 1
SRY, GLY95GLU

Schaffler et al. (2000) described a nonmosaic XY sex-reversed female
with pure gonadal dysgenesis (46,XY karyotype, completely female
external genitalia, normal mullerian ducts, absence of wolffian ducts,
and streak gonads; 400044) who harbored a yolk-sac tumor and was
referred for the assessment of primary amenorrhea. They identified a
novel de novo mutation, a G-to-A transition at position 284 within the
HMG box of the SRY gene, resulting in a gly95-to-glu substitution. This
mutation was not detected in the patient's father or in her male sibs.
The authors concluded that these data provide further evidence to
support the functional importance of the putative DNA-binding activity
of the SRY HMG box.

.0023
46,XY SEX REVERSAL 1
SRY, TYR127PHE

Jordan et al. (2002) reported an A-to-T transversion at nucleotide 380
(with respect to the initiation codon) in the SRY gene that resulted in
a tyr127-to-phe (Y127F) substitution in the protein. This sequence
variant was found not only in the XY female patient (400044) but also in
her father, a phenotypically normal male. However, the Y127F variant was
not found in the SRY sequences of 93 other randomly chosen males. This
substitution affects a highly conserved TYR residue in the HMG box of
SRY. Furthermore, electromobility shift studies demonstrate that SRY
protein harboring the Y127F variant is incapable of binding consensus
SRY binding sites in vitro. Taken together, these data suggested that
the variant is a novel mutation with functional consequences. The
authors concluded that this allelic SRY variant shared by both an
affected female and her normal father emphasizes the importance of
modifier genes in the sex determination pathway.

(1999) cloned full-length PKN3, which they called PKN-beta. The deduced
889-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 99.6 kD. PKN3
contains 3 N-terminal repeats of a charged region with leucine
zipper-like sequences, followed by a domain conserved in other PKN
proteins, 2 unique proline-rich regions, and a C-terminal catalytic
region with a protein kinase-type ATP-binding sequence. Northern blot
analysis detected a 3-kb PKN3 transcript in several cancer cell lines,
but not in normal adult human tissues. Western blot analysis revealed a
110-kD Pkn3 protein in NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts. PKN3 localized to the
Golgi apparatus in NIH3T3 and human cell lines.

GENE FUNCTION

Oishi et al. (1999) found that in vitro translated PKN3 bound RHOA
(ARHA; 165390) in a GTP-dependent manner. PKN3 also showed
autophosphorylation activity that was dependent on lys588.

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis, in vitro binding assays, and
immunoprecipitation analysis, Shibata et al. (2001) showed that PKN-beta
interacted with GRAF (ARHGAP26; 605370) and GRAF2 (ARHGAP10; 609746). A
constitutively active form of PKN-beta phosphorylated recombinant GRAF
and GRAF2. Mutation analysis showed that the linker region of PKN-beta
bound to the SH3 domains of GRAF and GRAF2.

Using a combination of 3-dimensional culture conditions and gene
expression profiling, Leenders et al. (2004) identified PKN3 as a
mediator of malignant growth of human prostate cancer cells downstream
of activated PI3K (see PIK3CG; 601232). Immunohistochemical analysis and
in situ hybridization showed that PKN3 was upregulated in human tumor
cells, but not in surrounding nontumorigenic tissues. Inducible
knockdown of PKN3 expression inhibited metastasis in a mouse prostate
tumor model. The catalytic activity of PKN3 depended upon PI3K, but not
on AKT (164730).

MAPPING

Hartz (2007) mapped the PKN3 gene to chromosome 9q34.11 based on an
alignment of the PKN3 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AB019692) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.1).

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching for sequences similar to YPEL1 (608082), followed by
screening a testis cDNA library, Hosono et al. (2004) cloned YPEL3. The
deduced 119-amino acid protein shares 100% amino acid identity with
mouse and monkey Ypel3 and 45.5% identity with Drosophila Yippee. YPEL3
shares 83.9 to 89.1% amino acid identity with YPEL1, YPEL2 (609723), and
YPEL4 (609725). All YPEL proteins contain an 86-amino acid YPEL
consensus sequence. PCR analysis detected YPEL3 expression in all adult
and fetal tissues examined. A second YPEL3 transcript was detected in
pancreas, placenta, and testis. Immunofluorescent staining of COS-7
green monkey kidney cells localized Ypel3 to the centrosome and
nucleolus during interphase and at several punctate structures around
the mitotic apparatus during the mitotic phase.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hosono et al. (2004) determined that the YPEL3 gene contains 5 exons and
spans about 4 kb. Exon 1 is untranslated. The mouse Ypel3 gene has the
same structure.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Hosono et al. (2004) mapped the human
YPEL3 gene to chromosome 16p11.2 and the mouse Ypel3 gene to chromosome
7F4.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Filamins, such as FLNC, are a family of actin (see ACTA1;
102610)-binding proteins involved in reshaping of the cytoskeleton. See
FLN1 (FLNA; 300017) for background information on the filamin gene
family.

CLONING

Xie et al. (1998) cloned FLNC, which they called ABPL, from a heart cDNA
library. The deduced 2,705-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular
mass of 289 kD. ABPL contains an N-terminal actin-binding domain,
followed by 24 repeats of about 94 amino acids. It has hinge sequences
prior to repeats 16 and 24. Xie et al. (1998) also identified an
alternatively spliced transcript that encodes a protein lacking hinge 1.
PCR analysis detected transcripts encoding the hinge 1-containing
isoform in stomach, uterus, umbilical vein endothelial cells, and
prostate. Transcripts encoding both isoforms were detected in heart,
thyroid, fetal brain, fetal lung, retina, spinal cord, skeletal muscle,
and bone marrow.

Using sarcoglycan-gamma (SGCG; 608896) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid
screen of a skeletal muscle cDNA library, followed by EST database
analysis and screening of a skeletal muscle cDNA library, Thompson et
al. (2000) cloned FLNC, which they called FLN2. The deduced 2,688-amino
acid protein shares 74% and 71% identity with FLN1 and filamin-beta
(FLNB; 603381), respectively, and the 3 proteins are nearly 100%
identical in the actin-binding domains. FLN2 lacks the first hinge
region present in FLN1 and FLNB, but it has the second hinge region.
Like FLN1 and FLNB, FLNC has a C-terminal domain containing binding
sites for several receptor proteins. Western blot analysis detected a
280-kD protein in heart and skeletal muscle.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Thompson et al. (2000) found that
sarcoglycan-gamma and -delta (SGCD; 601411) interacted with FLN2, but
sarcoglycan-alpha (SGCA; 600119) and -beta (SGCB; 600900) did not. In
vitro binding assays indicated that FLN2 interacted directly with
sarcoglycan-gamma and -delta, but not with dystrophin (DMD; 300377) and
syntrophin beta-1 (SNTB1; 600026). Coimmunoprecipitation analysis of
transfected proteins and of endogenous proteins in mouse myotube lysates
confirmed that FLN2 interacted with sarcoglycans-gamma and -delta. Fln2
was detected predominantly in the soluble fraction of lysed mouse
myotube cultures. Immunoelectron microscopy detected 2 pools of Fln2,
one adjacent to the sarcolemmal membrane and the other more diffuse.
Thompson et al. (2000) found elevated levels of membrane-associated FLN2
in 2 patients with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2C (LGMD2C;
253700), a patient with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD; 310200), and
dystrophic mice.

The KY protein (605739) has been implicated in a neuromuscular dystrophy
in the mouse, but its role in muscle function remains unclear. Beatham
et al. (2004) showed that KY interacted with several sarcomeric
cytoskeletal proteins including filamin C and the slow isoform of the
myosin-binding protein C (MYBPC1; 160794). A role for KY in regulating
filamin C function in vivo was supported by the expression analysis of
filamin C in the Ky-null mouse mutant, where distinct irregular
subcellular localization of filamin C was found in subsets of muscle
fibers, which appeared to be a specific outcome of KY deficiency. In
vitro assays showed that KY has protease activity, and specific
degradation of filamin C by KY was shown in transfected cells. Beatham
et al. (2004) suggested that KY may be an intrinsic part of the protein
networks underlying the molecular mechanism of several limb-girdle
muscular dystrophies, particularly those where interactions between
filamin C and disease-causing proteins have been shown.

MAPPING

Gariboldi et al. (1994) mapped the FLN2 gene to human chromosome
7q32-q35 by analysis of somatic cell hybrids containing portions of
chromosome 7. Chakarova et al. (2000) assigned the FLNC gene to 7q32 by
radiation hybrid analysis.

By interspecific backcross analysis, Gariboldi et al. (1994) mapped the
mouse homolog to chromosome 6 in a region showing homology of synteny to
human chromosome 7.

- Pseudogene

An FLNC pseudogene maps to chromosome 7q32-q35 about 53.7 kb downstream
from the functional FLNC gene. The pseudogene is 98% homologous to exons
46, 47, and 48 of the functional gene (van der Ven et al., 2010).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Myofibrillar Myopathy 5

In affected members of a German family with autosomal dominant
myofibrillar myopathy-5 (MFM5; 609524), Vorgerd et al. (2005) identified
a heterozygous mutation in the FLNC gene (102565.0001).

In a German mother and daughter with adult-onset limb-girdle muscle
weakness, Shatunov et al. (2009) identified a heterozygous deletion in
the FLNC gene (102565.0002). This family was the only 1 of 127 families
with a myopathy examined that was found to have an FLNC mutation,
indicating that this subtype of myofibrillar myopathy is rare.

- Distal Myopathy 4

By linkage analysis followed by candidate gene sequencing of an
Australian family with distal myopathy-4 (MPD4; 614065), reported by
Williams et al. (2005), Duff et al. (2011) identified a heterozygous
mutation in the FLNC gene (M251T; 102565.0003). A different heterozygous
mutation (A193T; 102565.0004) was found in affected members of an
Italian family with the same phenotype. Both mutations occurred in the
actin-binding domain, and in vitro cellular expression studies showed
that both mutations resulted in increased affinity for actin.

HISTORY

Kono et al. (2010) identified a heterozygous 1-bp deletion (8107delG) in
exon 48 of the FLNC gene in affected members of a Japanese family with
adult-onset myofibrillar myopathy primarily affecting the distal limbs,
with later involvement of proximal muscles. However, the paper was later
retracted by the authors after the mutation was found to occur in the
FLNC pseudogene, based on the report of van der Ven et al. (2010). Van
der Ven et al. (2010) noted that the pseudogene is 98% homologous to
exons 46, 47, and 48 of the functional FLNC gene and that the pseudogene
contains the 8107delG variant.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MYOPATHY, MYOFIBRILLAR, 5
FLNC, TRP2710TER

In affected members of a German family with autosomal dominant
myofibrillar myopathy-5 (MFM5; 609524), Vorgerd et al. (2005) identified
a heterozygous 8130G-A transition in exon 48 of the FLNC gene, resulting
in a trp2710-to-ter (W2710X) substitution. The mutation leads to a
truncation of the filamin C immunoglobulin domain that is responsible
for dimerization. Functional expression studies showed that the W2710X
protein had improper folding, was unable to form dimers, and showed
abnormal aggregation. The findings implied that dimer formation is
essential for the biologic function of filamin. The mutation was not
identified in 220 control chromosomes.

By in vitro functional expression studies, Lowe et al. (2007) showed
that W2710X-mutant protein was less stable and more susceptible to
proteolysis compared to wildtype. The mutant protein did not dimerize
properly and formed filamin aggregates in cultured cells. Aggregation of
mutant protein did not affect dimerization of wildtype filamin C, and
the mutant protein still showed normal binding to actin and
sarcoglycans.

.0002
MYOPATHY, MYOFIBRILLAR, 5
FLNC, 12-BP DEL, NT2997

In a German mother and daughter with autosomal dominant myofibrillar
myopathy-5 (609524), Shatunov et al. (2009) identified a heterozygous
12-bp deletion (2997_3008del) in exon 18 of the FLNC gene, predicted to
result in an in-frame deletion of 4 residues (val930 to thr933) in the
seventh repeat and confirmed by RT-PCR analysis of muscle tissue from
the affected daughter. The phenotype was characterized by adult-onset
muscle weakness initially involving proximal muscles of the lower limbs
and spreading to the upper limbs and distal muscles of lower
extremities. Both had paraspinal and abdominal muscle involvement and
winging of the scapula. Cardiac and respiratory muscles were not
affected. Skeletal muscle biopsy from the daughter showed marked
variation in fiber size, some fibers with internal nuclei, and type 1
fiber predominance. Several fibers showed polymorphous hyaline and
nonhyaline myofibrillary FLNC-positive inclusions with a convoluted,
serpentine appearance. Ultrastructural examination showed major
myofibrillar abnormalities, with accumulation of Z disc debris,
granulofilamentous material, and nemaline rods. There were also
mitochondrial aggregates.

.0003
MYOPATHY, DISTAL, 4
FLNC, MET251THR

In affected members of a large Australian family with autosomal dominant
distal myopathy-4 (MPD4; 614065) originally reported by Williams et al.
(2005), Duff et al. (2011) identified a heterozygous 752T-C transition
in exon 4 of the FLNC gene, resulting in a met251-to-thr (M251T)
substitution in a highly conserved residue in the CH2 domain in the
actin-binding domain. The mutation was not found in 400 control
chromosomes. The mutant protein had slightly decreased thermal stability
and showed increased actin-binding activity compared to the wildtype
protein. Transfection of the mutant M251T protein into cells showed
significantly decreased nuclear localization compared to wildtype and
resulted in the formation of intracellular protein aggregates. Duff et
al. (2011) concluded that the disease mechanism somehow involves
increased affinity for actin. The phenotype was characterized by adult
onset of distal muscle weakness and atrophy affecting the upper and
lower limbs, with nonspecific findings on muscle biopsy.

.0004
MYOPATHY, DISTAL, 4
FLNC, ALA193THR

In affected members of an Italian family with autosomal dominant distal
myopathy-4 (MPD4; 614065), Duff et al. (2011) identified a heterozygous
577G-A transition in exon 2 of the FLNC gene, resulting in an
ala193-to-thr (A193T) substitution in a highly conserved residue in the
CH2 domain in the actin-binding domain. The mutation was not found in
204 control chromosomes. The mutant protein had slightly decreased
thermal stability and showed increased actin-binding activity compared
to the wildtype protein. Nuclear localization was unaltered, but
transfection resulted in the formation of intracellular protein
aggregates. Duff et al. (2011) concluded that the disease mechanism
somehow involves increased affinity for actin. The phenotype was
characterized by adult onset of distal muscle weakness and atrophy
affecting the upper and lower limbs, with nonspecific findings on muscle
biopsy.
