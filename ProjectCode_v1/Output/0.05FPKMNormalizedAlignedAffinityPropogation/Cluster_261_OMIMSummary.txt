DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, which consist of a core protein with
at least 1 covalently attached glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chain, are
distributed on the surfaces of most cells and the extracellular matrix
in virtually every tissue. See 118661. Chondroitin sulfate has a linear
polymer structure that possesses repetitive, sulfated disaccharide units
containing glucuronic acid (GlcA) and N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc).
The major chondroitin sulfate found in mammalian tissues has sulfate
groups at position 4 or 6 of GalNAc residues. Chondroitin
6-sulfotransferase (C6ST) catalyzes the transfer of sulfate from PAPS
(3-prime-phosphoadenosine 5-prime-phosphosulfate) to position 6 of the
GalNAc residues. By screening a placenta library with a chicken C6ST
cDNA, Tsutsumi et al. (1998) isolated cDNAs encoding human C6ST. The
predicted 479-amino acid protein shares 74% and 36% identity with chick
C6ST and human keratan sulfate gal-6-sulfotransferase (CHST1; 603797),
respectively. Recombinant human enzyme displayed C6ST activity with a
marked specificity for a GlcA-GalNAc sequence. In addition, C6ST
catalyzed the sulfation of keratan sulfate. They noted that a deficiency
in C6ST has been associated with a heritable form of spondyloepiphyseal
dysplasia (271630).

Independently, Fukuta et al. (1998) cloned human C6ST cDNAs. Using
Northern blot analysis, they found that the 7.8-kb C6ST mRNA was
ubiquitous. Smaller transcripts were also observed in skeletal muscle
and heart.

GENE STRUCTURE

Tsutsumi et al. (1998) reported that the C6ST gene contains 3 exons and
spans more than 20 kb.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Iida et al. (2002) characterized single-nucleotide polymorphisms and
insertion-deletion polymorphisms in both the CHST1 gene (603797) and the
CHST3 gene.

In affected members of a large inbred Omani kindred with
spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia and congenital joint dislocations (143095),
Thiele et al. (2004) identified a homozygous arg304-to-gln mutation in
the CHST3 gene (R304Q; 603799.0001).

In 6 unrelated patients born with joint dislocations, some of whom
carried a diagnosis of recessive Larsen syndrome and others,
humerospinal dysostosis, Hermanns et al. (2008) identified homozygosity
or compound heterozygosity for 9 different mutations in the CHST3 gene
(see, e.g., 603799.0002-603799.0006). Noting the relatively narrow
phenotypic spectrum of these conditions, Hermanns et al. (2008)
suggested that the disorders previously designated as Omani-type
spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia and humerospinal dysostosis, as well as
some patients given a diagnosis of recessive Larsen syndrome, might
represent different age-related descriptions of the same condition.

In 2 Turkish sibs with spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia and congenital joint
dislocations, born of consanguineous parents, van Roij et al. (2008)
identified homozygosity for a missense mutation in the CHST3 gene
(603799.0007).

In 2 sibs and their affected uncle from a consanguineous Turkish
pedigree with spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia and subluxation of the radial
head, Tuysuz et al. (2009) identified homozygosity for a missense
mutation in the CHST3 gene (T141M; 603799.0009).

Unger et al. (2010) identified homozygous or compound heterozygous
mutations in CHST3 in 18 patients with spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia and
congenital joint dislocations from 17 families. The patients had
presented with various diagnoses, including 15 who had been diagnosed
with Larsen syndrome (see, e.g., 603799.0011 and 603799.0012), 2 with
chondrodysplasia with multiple dislocations (see, e.g., 603799.0002), 1
with humerospinal dysostosis (see 603799.0010), 1 with Desbuquois
syndrome (see 251450), and 1 with spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
SPONDYLOEPIPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA WITH CONGENITAL JOINT DISLOCATIONS
CHST3, ARG304GLN

In affected members of the large inbred kindred with spondyloepiphyseal
dysplasia with congenital joint dislocations (143095), first described
by Rajab et al. (2004) and designated 'Omani type,' Thiele et al. (2004)
identified a homozygous 911G-A transition in exon 3 of the CHST3 gene,
resulting in an arg304-to-gln (R304Q) substitution. The mutation occurs
in the highly conserved 3-prime-phosphoadenosine 5-prime-phosphosulfate
(PAPS) binding site.

.0002
SPONDYLOEPIPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA WITH CONGENITAL JOINT DISLOCATIONS
CHST3, LEU259PRO

In a 10.5-year-old Turkish-German girl with spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia
and congenital joint dislocations (143095), born of consanguineous
parents, Hermanns et al. (2008) identified homozygosity for a 776T-C
transition in exon 3 of the CHST3 gene, resulting in a leu259-to-pro
(L259P) substitution at a highly conserved residue. The parents were
heterozygous for the mutation, and the patient had an unaffected
brother. Functional analysis in cultured skin fibroblasts revealed that
the L259P mutation severely impaired or abolished CHST3 function. Unger
et al. (2010) restudied this patient and noted that although she had
initially been diagnosed as having Larsen syndrome (see 245600), there
was now clear evidence of SED with severe spinal degeneration.

In a Lebanese boy with SED and congenital joint dislocations, who was
originally reported by Megarbane and Ghanem (2004) and given the
diagnosis of 'chondrodysplasia with multiple dislocations,' Unger et al.
(2010) identified homozygosity for the L259P mutation in the CHST3 gene.

.0003
SPONDYLOEPIPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA WITH CONGENITAL JOINT DISLOCATIONS
CHST3, ARG222TRP

In a 17-year-old Swiss patient with spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia with
congenital joint dislocations (143095), born of parents from the same
small village, Hermanns et al. (2008) identified homozygosity for a
664C-T transition in exon 3 of the CHST3 gene, resulting in an
arg222-to-trp (R222W) substitution at a highly conserved residue. The
parents were heterozygous for the mutation, and the patient had an
unaffected brother. Functional analysis in cultured skin fibroblasts
revealed that the R222W mutation severely impaired or abolished CHST3
function. Unger et al. (2010) restudied this patient and noted that
although initially the diagnosis had been Larsen syndrome (see 245600),
there was now clear evidence of SED with severe spinal degeneration.

.0004
SPONDYLOEPIPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA WITH CONGENITAL JOINT DISLOCATIONS
CHST3, LEU307PRO

In a Sardinian boy with spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia and congenital
joint dislocations (143095), Hermanns et al. (2008) identified
homozygosity for a 920T-C transition in exon 3 of the CHST3 gene,
resulting in a leu307-to-pro (L307P) substitution at a highly conserved
residue. The parents were heterozygous for the mutation. Although the
patient previously carried a diagnosis of recessive Larsen syndrome
(245600), the authors noted that his appearance was 'identical' to that
of the patient originally reported with humerospinal dysostosis by Hall
(1997) (see 603799.0010).

Unger et al. (2010) studied cultured fibroblasts from the Sardinian boy
who was homozygous for L307P and observed almost no C6ST activity
compared to controls.

.0005
SPONDYLOEPIPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA WITH CONGENITAL JOINT DISLOCATIONS
CHST3, 1-BP DEL, 1086G

In a 31-year-old Spanish man with spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia with
congenital joint dislocations (143095), originally reported as having
humerospinal dysostosis (HSD) at 2 years of age by Cortina et al.
(1979), Hermanns et al. (2008) identified compound heterozygosity for a
1-bp deletion (1086delG) in exon 3 of the CHST3 gene, resulting in a
frameshift and premature termination of the protein, and a 603C-A
transversion in exon 3 of the CHST3 gene, resulting in a tyr201-to-ter
(Y201X; 603799.0006) substitution at a highly conserved residue. The
parents were each heterozygous for one of the mutations, respectively,
and he had an unaffected sister. In another Spanish patient who had
originally been diagnosed with HSD, Hermanns et al. (2008) identified
compound heterozygosity for 1086delG and a 1114G-A transition in exon 3
of the CHST3 gene, resulting in a glu372-to-lys (E372K) substitution at
a highly conserved residue. The E372K mutation was not found in more
than 250 control chromosomes.

.0007
SPONDYLOEPIPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA WITH CONGENITAL JOINT DISLOCATIONS
CHST3, LEU286PRO

In 2 Turkish sibs with spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia and congenital joint
dislocations (143095), born of second-cousin parents, van Roij et al.
(2008) identified homozygosity for an 857T-C transition in the CHST3
gene, predicted to result in a leu286-to-pro (L286P) substitution at a
highly conserved residue adjacent to the binding site for PAPS.
Functional studies in patient fibroblasts showed dramatically reduced
C6ST1 activity compared to wildtype.

.0009
SPONDYLOEPIPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA WITH CONGENITAL JOINT DISLOCATIONS
CHST3, THR141MET

In 2 sibs and their affected paternal uncle from a consanguineous
Turkish pedigree with spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia and congenital joint
dislocations (143095), Tuysuz et al. (2009) identified homozygosity for
a 422C-T transition in exon 3 of the CHST3 gene, resulting in a
thr141-to-met (T141M) substitution at a conserved residue. Western blot
analysis showed comparable expression levels of the mutant and wildtype
proteins, but sulfotransferase activity of the mutant was reduced to
less than 30% of wildtype.

.0010
SPONDYLOEPIPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA WITH CONGENITAL JOINT DISLOCATIONS
CHST3, PHE159ILE

In a 15-year-old patient with spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia and
congenital joint dislocations (143095), originally reported by Hall
(1997) with a diagnosis of humerospinal dysostosis, Unger et al. (2010)
identified homozygosity for a 475T-A transversion in the CHST3 gene,
resulting in a phe159-to-ile (F159I) substitution. The mutation was not
found in more than 250 control chromosomes. Follow-up evaluation of the
patient by Unger et al. (2010) showed a dysplastic mitral valve with
stenosis and moderate insufficiency, as well as a mildly thickened
aortic valve.

.0011
SPONDYLOEPIPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA WITH CONGENITAL JOINT DISLOCATIONS
CHST3, LEU161PHE

In a patient with spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia and congenital joint
dislocations (143095), who was referred for evaluation of presumed
Larsen syndrome (see 245600), Unger et al. (2010) identified
homozygosity for a 481C-T transition in the CHST3 gene, resulting in a
leu161-to-phe (L161F) substitution. The mutation was not found in more
than 250 control chromosomes.

.0012
SPONDYLOEPIPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA WITH CONGENITAL JOINT DISLOCATIONS
CHST3, GLN330TER

In a patient with spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia and congenital joint
dislocations (143095), who had initially been diagnosed with Larsen
syndrome (see 150250) but who was negative for mutation in the FLNB gene
(603381), Unger et al. (2010) identified homozygosity for a 988C-T
transition in the CHST3 gene, resulting in a gln330-to-ter (Q330X)
substitution.

138300	TITLE +138300 GLUTATHIONE REDUCTASE; GSR
GLUTATHIONE REDUCTASE, HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA DUE TO DEFICIENCY OF, IN RED
CELLS, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION Long (1967) found in a black American a variant red cell GSR (EC
1.6.4.2) characterized by greater electrophoretic mobility and enzyme
activity per unit of hemoglobin than the normal. Inheritance was
autosomal codominant. Three homozygotes were identified. The relation to
gout, suggested by Long (1967), is problematical. Long (1972) observed 2
variant forms of red cell GSR which appear to bind far more avidly than
the common form of the enzyme. In cases of mosaic trisomy for chromosome
8, de la Chapelle et al. (1976) found elevated glutathione reductase
activity, with other enzymes normal. George and Francke (1976) assigned
the gene to the region 8p21-p23 by the gene dosage method. In an infant
with terminal deletion of the short arm of chromosome 8, de la Chapelle
et al. (1976) found low GSR activity. They concluded that the GSR locus
is in the region 8pter-p21. Sinet et al. (1977) narrowed the assignment
to 8p21. The GSR locus has also been assigned by somatic cell
hybridization; it is one of the enzyme-markers for each chromosome
(table 1 in Shows and Sakaguchi, 1980), useful for synteny mapping.

Lohr and Waller (1962) observed a 'new' form of enzyme-deficiency
hemolytic anemia in which glutathione reductase was deficient and
glutathione (GSH) was low as a consequence. (This condition is
apparently distinct from that described by Oort et al. (1961) in which
GSH was also low, but glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and glutathione
reductase were normal.) Lohr (1963) observed 10 homozygotes and 5
heterozygotes in a family distribution consistent with autosomal
recessive inheritance. Blume et al. (1968) studied a kindred with many
persons who were demonstrably heterozygous by chemical test. Hampel et
al. (1969) found a markedly increased frequency of chromosomal
aberrations in a patient with pancytopenia and absent GSR-II band in the
electropherogram. The mother was hematologically normal but had absent
GSR-II band and a moderate increase in the frequency of chromosomal
aberrations. Addition of chloramphenicol to the cultures increased the
number of damaged chromosomes in both the mother and the son. Staal et
al. (1969) described a variety of glutathione reductase anemia in which
the variant enzyme had diminished affinity for flavin adenine
dinucleotide (FAD). The patient's anemia was corrected by vitamin B2.
Administration of flavin compounds to normal individuals or addition to
hemolysates of most normal persons causes an increase in activity of GSR
(Beutler, 1969). In a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus,
Fajnholc et al. (1971) found red cell GSR deficiency which was
correctable in vivo with riboflavin and in vitro with FAD. The same
deficiency was found in the mother and some of her relatives (who were
asymptomatic) but not in the father and his relatives. Enzyme kinetics
were normal. These workers concluded that the defect was not in the
apoenzyme. Loos et al. (1976) found virtually complete absence of GSR
activity in the erythrocytes of 3 children of a consanguineous marriage
and intermediate levels in the parents. Activity was not restored by FAD
in vitro or riboflavin in vivo. Clinically the deficiency was manifested
by favism in 1 child and by cataracts in 2. Reduced GSR was found in
leukocytes, as well as evidence of impaired bactericidal capacity, but
there was no history of repeated infections. Furthermore, Roos et al.
(1979) found that chemotaxis, phagocytosis of opsonized S. aureus, and
degranulation proceeded normally. Intracellular killing appeared normal
at low ratios of bacteria to phagocytes, but higher ratios resulted in
defective bacterial killing. GSR deficiency is a frequent occurrence in
northern Thailand. Flatz (1971) found a high frequency of GSR deficiency
in northern Thailand but concluded that it was probably secondary to
dietary riboflavin deficiency because activity of the enzyme was raised
markedly in most deficient persons by administration of riboflavin.
Studies of the families of 6 persons with poor response to riboflavin
gave no evidence supporting 'simple dominant inheritance,' and the
proband with low GSR values had no hematologic evidence of a hemolytic
tendency. Nevin et al. (1990) found increased GSR activity in a child
with an inverted tandem duplication of 8p23.1-p12.

Data on gene frequencies of allelic variants were tabulated by
Roychoudhury and Nei (1988).

ANIMAL MODEL

Using a combination of behavioral analysis of 6 inbred mouse strains
with quantitative gene expression profiling of several brain regions,
Hovatta et al. (2005) identified 17 genes with expression patterns that
correlated with anxiety-like behavioral phenotypes. To determine if 2 of
the genes, glyoxalase-1 (138750) and glutathione reductase-1, have a
causal role in the genesis of anxiety, Hovatta et al. (2005) performed
genetic manipulation using lentivirus-mediated gene transfer. Local
overexpression of these genes in the mouse brain resulted in increased
anxiety-like behavior, while local inhibition of glyoxalase-1 expression
by RNA interference decreased the anxiety-like behavior. Hovatta et al.
(2005) concluded that both of these genes are involved in oxidative
stress metabolism, linking this pathway with anxiety-related behavior.
