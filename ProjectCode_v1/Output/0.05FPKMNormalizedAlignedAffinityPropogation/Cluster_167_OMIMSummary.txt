DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database searching for sequences homologous to rat robl/LC7-like
gene-1, Jiang et al. (2001) identified 2 members of the dynein family
that they designated DNLC2A and DNLC2B (607168). Both DNLC2A and DNLC2B
encode deduced 96-amino acid proteins with molecular masses of 10.9 and
10.8 kD, respectively. The proteins share 77% sequence identity and show
high homology to robl/LC7 dynein proteins. Northern blot analysis
detected high expression of DNLC2A in heart, liver, brain, and pancreas,
moderate expression in placenta, skeletal muscle, and kidney, and low
expression in lung, prostate, testis, small intestine, and colon.
Expression of DNLC2A was lower than that of DNLC2B in all normal tissues
tested except liver. Northern blot and RT-PCR analysis in hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC) tissues of 68 Chinese patients showed upregulation of
DNLC2A in 45 cases and dowregulation of DNLC2B in 44 cases compared with
adjacent tumor-free liver tissues. In 7 additional cancer cell lines
studied, DNLC2A was highly expressed in all, whereas DNLC2B was highly
expressed in only 1 HCC cell line.

GENE STRUCTURE

Jiang et al. (2001) determined that the DNLC2A gene contains 4 exons and
spans at least 25 kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Jiang et al. (2001) mapped the DNLC2A gene
near marker D20S106 on chromosome 20q12-q13.11.

603130	TITLE *603130 ATTRACTIN; ATRN
;;MAHOGANY, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF; MGCA
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Attractin is a human serum glycoprotein that is rapidly expressed on
activated T cells and released extracellularly after 48 to 72 hours.
Duke-Cohan et al. (1998) cloned attractin and found that, as in its
natural serum form, it mediates the spreading of monocytes that becomes
the focus for the clustering of nonproliferating T lymphocytes. There
are 2 mRNA species with hematopoietic tissue-specific expression that
code for a 134-kD protein with a putative serine protease catalytic
serine, 4 EGF-like motifs, a CUB domain, a C-type lectin domain, and a
domain homologous with the ligand-binding region of the common gamma
cytokine chain. Except for the last 2 domains, the overall structure
shares high homology with a protein of Caenorhabditis elegans,
suggesting that attractin has evolved new domains and functions in
parallel with the development of cell-mediated immunity.

Gunn et al. (1999) and Nagle et al. (1999) independently and
simultaneously cloned the mouse 'mahogany' gene. Using a positional
cloning strategy, Gunn et al. (1999) identified a mahogany candidate
gene, Mgca, on chromosome 2. The normal 9-kb Mgca mRNA is expressed in
brain, skin, heart, kidney, liver, and lung. The sequence of the
extracellular domain of Mgca protein is 93% identical to the sequence of
attractin. The peptide sequence of attractin terminates 6 codons after
it diverges from Mgca and 11 codons before the transmembrane domain of
Mgca. Using a probe corresponding to the amino-terminal region of mouse
Mgca, Gunn et al. (1999) detected 2 main RNA isoforms of 8.5 and 4 kb in
human tissues. They postulated that the 8.5-kb transcript is likely to
encode the transmembrane form of human attractin because it is also
detected by a probe corresponding to the Mgca C terminus. Gunn et al.
(1999) also detected a human brain cDNA clone with 97% identity to the
C-terminal 452 residues of Mgca. The site at which the attractin and
human brain cDNAs diverge corresponds to a splice junction in the Mgca
genomic sequence.

When attractin was identified as the product of the murine 'mahogany'
gene with connections to control of pigmentation and energy metabolism,
and the 'mahogany' product was identified and shown to be a
transmembrane protein, the possibility of a human membrane attractin in
addition to the secreted form was raised. Tang et al. (2000) described
the complete genomic sequence of attractin, focusing in particular on
the exons coding for the 3-prime region, and showed how both human
membrane and secreted attractin arise as a result of alternate splicing
of the same gene. They found that soluble attractin arises from
transcription of 25 sequential exons on 20p13, where the 3-prime
terminal exon contains sequence from a long interspersed nuclear
element-1 (LINE-1) retrotransposon insertion that includes a stop codon
and a polyadenylation signal. The mRNA isoform for membrane attraction
splices over the LINE-1 exon and includes 5 exons encoding transmembrane
and cytoplasmic domains with organization and coding potential almost
identical to that of the mouse gene. The relative abundance of soluble
and transmembrane isoforms measured by RT-PCR is differentially
regulated in lymphoid tissues. Because activation of peripheral blood
leukocytes with phytohemagglutinin induces strong expression of cell
surface attractin followed by release of soluble attractin, these
results suggested to Tang et al. (2000) that LINE-1 insertion, a genomic
event unique to mammals, provided an evolutionarily mechanism for
regulating cell interactions during an inflammatory reaction.

GENE FUNCTION

Agouti protein (600201), a paracrine signaling molecule normally limited
to the skin, is ectopically expressed in 'lethal yellow, or A(y), mice
and causes obesity by mimicking agouti-related protein (AGRP; 602311),
found primarily in the hypothalamus. Loss of function of the mouse Atrn
protein in mahogany mutant mice blocks the pleiotropic effects of A(y).
He et al. (2001) demonstrated in transgenic, biochemical, and
genetic-interaction experiments that attractin is a low affinity
receptor for agouti protein, but not for Agrp, in vitro and in vivo.
Additional histopathologic abnormalities in homozygous mahogany mice and
cross-species genomic comparisons indicated that Atrn has multiple
functions distinct from both a physiologic and an evolutionary
perspective.

Nagle et al. (1999) emphasized the importance of Mgca expression in the
ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus, a region central to the regulation of
body weight and feeding. Nagle et al. (1999) demonstrated that the
mahogany locus did not suppress the obese phenotype of the
melanocortin-4 receptor (155541) null allele or those of the monogenic
obese mouse models Lep-db, tub, and Cpe-fat. However, mahogany can
suppress diet-induced obesity, the mechanism of which Nagle et al.
(1999) suggested has implications for therapeutic intervention in human
obesity.

Malik et al. (2001) determined that attractin mRNA and protein were
expressed in rat and human glioma cell lines and noted that expression
had not been found in normal glial cells. Biochemical characterization
of attractin from human glioma cell lines showed that membrane-bound
attractin had DPP4 (102720)-like hydrolytic activity. Flow cytometry
revealed attractin present in cell lines that did not show DPP4-like
activity, implying that attractin could be present in either
enzymatically active or inactive forms.

MAPPING

By sequence homology and EST database searching, Tang et al. (2000)
mapped the human ATRN gene to chromosome 20p13.

300574	TITLE *300574 CHEMOKINE, CXC MOTIF, RECEPTOR 3; CXCR3
;;G PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTOR 9; GPR9;;
CD183 ANTIGEN; CD183
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Chemokines mediate migration of immune cells into infected or inflamed
tissues to initiate effective immune responses. The chemokine receptor
CXCR3 is preferentially expressed by T helper-1 (Th1) cells and is
critically involved in their recruitment to inflamed tissue. Tissue
infiltration of T cells expressing high levels of CXCR3 depends on
interferon-gamma (IFNG; 147570)-induced release of the CXCR3 ligands
CXCL9 (601704), CXCL10 (147310), or CXCL11 (604852). CXCR3 is also
expressed on nonlymphoid tissue-homing CD4 (186940)-positive/CD25
(IL2RA; 147730)-positive regulatory T (Treg) cells (summary by Erhardt
et al., 2011).

CLONING

A wide spectrum of intercellular signals is mediated by peptide ligands
interacting with specific cell surface receptors. Many peptide-binding
receptors belong to the G protein-coupled receptor family and exhibit
common structural features, including the presence of 7 transmembrane
domains and a number of conserved amino acid residues. Marchese et al.
(1995) used PCR and genomic DNA library screening to clone 2 novel human
genes, GPR9 and GPR10 (600895), and a rat gene, GPR14 (600896). Each of
these encodes a G protein-coupled receptor. The receptor encoded by GPR9
was found to share the highest identity with human IL8 receptor type B
(IL8RB; 146928) (38% overall and 53% in the transmembrane regions),
followed by IL8RA (146929) (36% overall and 51% in the transmembrane
domains).

By database analysis and 5-prime and 3-prime RACE of total mRNA from
human microvascular endothelial cells and thymus, Lasagni et al. (2003)
cloned a novel CXCR3 splice variant that they termed CXCR3B. The
predicted CXCR3B protein contains 416 amino acids and has a longer N
terminus that differs from the original 368-amino acid CXCR3 protein,
CXCR3A, in the first 52 residues. Northern blot analysis detected CXCR3A
and CXCR3B transcripts of 1.6 and 1.8 kb, respectively, in heart,
kidney, liver, and skeletal muscle, with CXCR3A predominating. CXCR3A
was also present in placenta.

GENE FUNCTION

The superfamily of chemokines consists of an array of chemoattractant
proteins that has been divided into 4 branches (C, CC, CXC, and CXXC) on
the basis of the relative position of the cysteine residues in the
mature protein. Structural variants of chemokines are associated with
differences in their ability to regulate the trafficking of immune cells
during hematopoiesis and inflammatory responses. Chemokines exert their
attractant properties after binding to distinct membrane receptors.
Because a single chemokine receptor binds several chemokines, it is
often difficult to evaluate the activity of these structures in
lymphocyte homing. For instance, interferon (IFN)-inducible protein-10
(IP10, or CXCL10; 147310) and IFN-gamma-induced monokine-2 (MIG, or
CXCL9; 601704), CXC chemokines that are induced by IFN-gamma, bind the
CXCR3 receptor and are shown to be specifically chemotactic for
activated lymphocytes (Loetscher et al., 1996).

Although FACS analysis demonstrated that 40% of resting T lymphocytes
expressed CXCR3, Loetscher et al. (1998) found that these cells did not
have detectable CXCR3 transcripts and did not respond to CXCL9 or
CXCL10. However, exposure to IL2 (147680) with or without mitogen for 2
weeks resulted in expression of CXCR3 on more than 95% of T lymphocytes.

Using Northern blot analysis, Bonecchi et al. (1998) showed that
polarized Th1 cells preferentially express CXCR3 and CCR5 (601373). In
contrast, Th2 cells preferentially express CCR4 (604836) and, at least
in a subpopulation of Th2 cells, CCR3 (601268).

Trentin et al. (1999) investigated the expression and function of CXCR3
on normal and malignant B cells from 65 patients with chronic
lymphoproliferative disorders. Although CXCR3 was lacking in CD5(+) and
CD5(-) B cells from healthy subjects, it was expressed on leukemic B
lymphocytes from all (31/31) patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia
(CLL). The presence of CXCR3 was heterogeneous in other B-cell
disorders, being expressed in 2 of 7 patients with mantle cell lymphoma
(MCL), 4 of 12 patients with hairy cell leukemia (HCL), and 11 of 15
patients with other subtypes of non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs). Chemotaxis
assay showed that normal B cells from healthy subjects did not migrate
in response to IP10 and MIG. In contrast, a definite migration in
response to IP10 and MIG was observed in all malignant B cells from
patients with CLL, but not in patients with HCL or MCL. Neoplastic B
cells from other NHLs showed a heterogeneous pattern. The migration
elicited by IP10 and MIG was inhibited by blocking CXCR3. No effect of
IP10 and MIG chemokines was observed on the cytosolic calcium
concentration in malignant B cells. The data demonstrated that CXCR3 is
expressed on malignant B cells from chronic lymphoproliferative
disorders, particularly in patients with CLL, and represents a fully
functional receptor involved in chemotaxis of malignant B lymphocytes.

Using bronchoalveolar lavage and flow cytometry, Campbell et al. (2001)
determined that T lymphocytes homing to the lung in both normal and
asthmatic subjects express CCR5 and CXCR3 but not CCR9 (604738), which
is found on T cells homing to intestinal mucosal sites, or CLA (see
SELPLG; 600738), which is found on skin-homing T cells.

Frigerio et al. (2002) demonstrated that in response to inflammation,
beta cells secrete the chemokine CXC ligand-10 (CXCL10; 147310) and CXC
ligand-9 (CXCL9; 601704), which specifically attract T-effector cells
via CXCR3. In mice deficient for this receptor, the onset of type 1
diabetes (222100) is substantially delayed. Thus, Frigerio et al. (2002)
concluded that in the absence of known etiologic agents, CXCR3
represents a novel target for therapeutic interference early in type 1
diabetes.

Using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, Booth et al. (2002)
showed that IP10 (CXCL10) interacted with the N terminus of CXCR3 via a
hydrophobic cleft formed by the N-loop and 40s-loop region of IP10,
similar to the interaction surface of other chemokines, such as IL8
(146930). An additional region of interaction was found that consisted
of a hydrophobic cleft formed by the N terminus and the 30s loop of
IP10.

Lasagni et al. (2003) found that both CXCR3A and CXCR3B bound CXCL9,
CXCL10, and CXCL11 (604852), but only CXCR3B bound CXCL4 (PF4; 173460),
following expression in a microvascular endothelial cell line.
Overexpression of CXCR3A induced an increase in endothelial cell
survival, whereas overexpression of CXCR3B upregulated apoptotic
pathways. Immunohistochemical analysis of primary microvascular
endothelial cells, whose growth in inhibited by CXCL4, CXCL9, CXCL10,
and CXCL11, demonstrated expression of CXCR3B, but not CXCR3A.
CXCR3B-specific monoclonal antibodies reacted with neoplastic tissue
endothelial cells, providing evidence that CXCR3B is expressed in vivo
and may account for the angiostatic effects of CXC chemokines.

Although chemokine signaling is often promiscuous, signaling events
between members of the distinct chemokine classes (CXC, CC, CX3C, and C)
are almost never observed. Dijkstra et al. (2004) showed that human
CCL21 (602737), in the absence of its primary receptor, CCR7 (600242),
is a functional ligand for CXCR3, inducing chemotaxis in adult
microglial cells, but not in kidney epithelial cells. CCL21-induced
chemotaxis could be inhibited by the CXCR3 ligand, CXCL10, whereas
CXCL10 had no effect on CX3CL1 (601880) chemotactic activity.
Fluorescence microscopy demonstrated that CXCR3 was expressed
predominantly in microglial cytoplasm. Dijkstra et al. (2004) concluded
that CCL21 signaling through CXCR3 depends on the cellular background in
which CXCR3 is expressed.

Using microarray analysis, Feferman et al. (2005) found increased
expression of Cxl10 and its receptor, Cxcr3, in lymph node cells of rats
with experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis (MG; 254200). Real-time
RT-PCR, FACS, and immunohistochemistry analyses confirmed these findings
and revealed upregulated expression of another Cxcr3 chemoattractant,
Cxcl9, and of Tnf (191160) and Il1b (147720), which act synergistically
with Ifng (147570) to induce Cxcl10, in both lymph node cells and muscle
of myasthenic rats. Upregulation of these genes was reduced after
mucosal tolerance induction with an AChR (see CHRNA1; 100725) fragment.
Using RT-PCR, flow cytometric, and fluorescence microscopy analyses,
Feferman et al. (2005) found increased expression of CXL10 and CXCR3 in
thymus and muscle of MG patients compared with age-matched controls,
validating their findings in the rat model of MG. They concluded that
CXCL10/CXCR3 signaling is associated with MG pathogenesis and proposed
that CXCL10 and CXCR3 may serve as novel drug targets to treat MG.

Oo et al. (2010) found that 18% of T cells in inflamed areas of diseased
human livers expressed the Treg marker FOXP3 (300292). Flow cytometric
analysis showed that inflamed liver Tregs expressed higher levels of
CCR4 and CXCR3 compared with blood Tregs. Adhesion assays showed that
Tregs used CXCR3 and alpha-4 (ITGA4; 192975)/beta-1 (ITGB1; 135630) to
bind and transmigrate, whereas CCR4 played no role. The CCR4 ligands
CCL17 (601520) and CCL22 (602957) were absent from healthy liver, but
they were expressed by dendritic cells in inflamed liver, and these
dendritic cells were associated with CD8 T cells and CCR4-positive Tregs
in the parenchyma and septal areas. Ex vivo, liver-derived Tregs
migrated to CCR4 ligands secreted by dendritic cells. Oo et al. (2010)
proposed that CXCR3 mediates recruitment of Tregs via hepatic sinusoidal
endothelium and that dendritic cells secrete CCR4 ligands that recruit
Tregs to sites of inflammation in patients with chronic hepatitis.

By binding analyses, Struyf et al. (2011) found that human CXCL4L1
(PF4V1; 173461), a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis, had lower affinity
for heparin and chondroitin sulfate-E than did CXCL4 and that CXCL10 and
CXCL4L1 could displace each other on human microvascular endothelial
cells. CXCL4L1 bound to both CXCR3A and CXCR3B. Antibodies to CXCR3
blocked CXCL4L1 antiangiogenic activity, and human CXCL4L1 activity was
reduced in mice treated with anti-human CXCR3 or in mice lacking Cxcr3,
as assessed by tumor growth and vascularization of Lewis lung carcinoma.
Like CXCL4, CXCL4L1 attracted activated T, natural killer, and dendritic
cells, but preincubation with CXCL10 and CXCL11, pertussis toxin, or
anti-CXCR3 reduced or neutralized this activity. Struyf et al. (2011)
concluded that CXCR3A and CXCR3B are involved in the chemotactic and
vascular effects of CXCL4L1.

Endo et al. (2011) examined expression of cell surface markers to
identify functionally distinct subpopulations of mouse memory Th2 cells.
FACS analysis demonstrated 4 Th2 subpopulations based on high or low
expression levels of Cd62l (SELL; 153240) and Cxcr3. All 4
subpopulations produced comparable levels of Il4 (147780) and Il13
(147683), but Th2 cells expressing low levels of both Cd62l and Cxcr3
(Cd62l-lo/Cxcr3-lo cells) selectively produced Il5 (147850). Il5
production in Cd62l-lo/Cxcr3-lo cells was accompanied by histone H3-K4
methylation, a marker for the permissive conformation of chromatin, at
the IL5 promoter. DNA microarray analysis and quantitative RT-PCR showed
that Cd44 (107269)-positive memory Th2 cells expressing Il5 had lower
levels of Eomes (604615) and Tbx21 (604895) and higher levels of Rora
(600825) and Pparg (601487) than memory Th2 cells lacking Il5
expression. RNA silencing demonstrated that Eomes downregulation was
required for Il5 expression and that Eomes had no effect on H3-K4
methylation at the Il5 promoter. Instead Eomes suppressed Gata3 (131320)
transcriptional activity by inhibiting Gata3 binding to the Il5
promoter. Depletion of Cd62l-lo/Cxcr3-lo cells ameliorated memory Th2
cell-dependent airway inflammation in mice. Endo et al. (2011) concluded
that IL5 production preferentially occurs in the CD62L-lo/CXCR3-lo
subpopulation regulated by EOMES expression.

GENE STRUCTURE

Marchese et al. (1995) determined that GPR10 and GPR14 are intronless
within their coding regions, while GPR9 contains at least 1 intron.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Marchese et al. (1995) mapped the
GPR9 gene to 8p12-p11.2 and the GPR10 gene to 10q25.3-q26. Using FISH,
PCR, and Southern blot analysis, Loetscher et al. (1998) determined that
CXCR3 is a single-copy gene that maps to chromosome Xq13. The
International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium confirmed that the
CXCR3 gene maps to the X chromosome (TMAP RH47042).

ANIMAL MODEL

Liu et al. (2006) noted that mice lacking the Cxcr3 ligand Cxcl10
exhibit enhanced susceptibility to experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model for certain aspects of multiple
sclerosis (MS; 126200). They found that EAE in mice lacking Cxcr3 was
characterized by exaggerated severity, aggravated blood-brain barrier
disruption, and increased tissue damage, accompanied by reduced
production of Ifng and impaired expression of inducible nitric oxide
synthase (NOS2A; 163730), compared with wildtype mice with EAE. However,
immunohistochemical, microscopic, and flow cytometric analyses
demonstrated a lack of quantitative and qualitative differences in
leukocytes infiltrating the central nervous system between Cxcr3 -/- and
wildtype mice with EAE. Liu et al. (2006) concluded that Cxcl10 is the
most relevant Cxcr3 ligand in EAE, and that Cxcr3 does not govern
leukocyte trafficking in EAE, but modulates Ifng production and
downstream events affecting disease severity.

Using a mouse model of immune-mediated liver injury induced by
concanavalin A (ConA), Erhardt et al. (2011) demonstrated enhanced
intrahepatic expression of the Cxcr3 ligands Cxcl9, Cxcl10, and Cxcl11
following induction of ConA hepatitis. Cxcr3 -/- mice developed more
severe liver injury with higher plasma transaminase activities and a
more pronounced Th1/Th17 response compared with wildtype mice after ConA
treatment. In addition, Cxcr3 -/- mice did not establish tolerance upon
ConA restimulation, although Tregs from Cxcr3 -/- mice were still
immunosuppressive in an in vitro suppression assay. However, there was
no accumulation of Cxcr3-positive/Tbet (TBX21; 604895)-positive Tregs
producing Il10 (124092) in liver of Cxcr3 -/- mice, as there was in
wildtype mice. Conversion to Tregs was dependent on a Th1 response, as
Ifng-deficient mice failed to produce Cxcr3-positive/Tbet-positive
Tregs. Cd25-positive/Foxp3-positive Tregs failed to protect against
ConA-induced hepatitis, whereas Cxcr3-positive/Tbet-positive Tregs
protected Cxcr3 -/- mice and allowed recovery from injury. Erhardt et
al. (2011) concluded that CXCR3-positive/TBET-positive/IL10-positive
Tregs are generated in liver in an IFNG-dependent manner, then
disseminate into the organism and migrate to liver, where they limit
immune-mediated damage.

Wuest and Carr (2008) found that corneal infection with herpes simplex
virus-1 (HSV1) resulted in elevated viral titers in the nervous system
of Cxcl10 -/- mice, which correlated with defects in leukocyte
recruitment to the brainstem. Similar levels of HSV1 were recovered from
Cxcl10 -/- or wildtype mice lacking natural killer (NK) cells or
virus-specific Cd8 (see 186910)-positive T cells. Cxcr3 -/- mice also
had poor recruitment of NK cells, but not Cd8-positive cells. Wuest and
Carr (2008) concluded that antigen-specific CD8-positive T cells,
recruited through CXCL10, are critical in the antiviral response at the
brainstem.

;;LUC7-LIKE 3;;
CISPLATIN RESISTANCE-ASSOCIATED OVEREXPRESSED PROTEIN; CROP;;
LUC7A
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By differential display of transcripts overexpressed in a
cisplatin-resistant human renal cancer cell line, followed by 5-prime
RACE, Nishii et al. (2000) cloned 2 cDNA variants of CROP. The shorter
variant encodes a deduced 432-amino acid protein. The N-terminal half
contains cystine/histidine motifs and leucine zipper-like repeats, and
the C-terminal half consists mostly of charged and polar amino acids.
The longer variant contains several nonsense codons and is not
translatable. Northern blot analysis detected a 3.5-kb transcript in
almost all tissues examined. Expression was strong in heart, brain,
pancreas, thymus, ovary, small intestine, and peripheral blood
leukocytes, and weak in lung, liver, and kidney. Western blot analysis
detected CROP at an apparent molecular mass of 58 kD in nuclear extracts
of cisplatin-resistant cells and in COS-7 cells.

Umehara et al. (2003) detected fluorescence-tagged CROP in a speckled
intranuclear distribution in transfected COS-7 cells. Mutation analysis
determined that the C-terminal 187 amino acids contain the nuclear
distribution signal.

GENE FUNCTION

Nishii et al. (2000) found that expression of a translatable CROP mRNA
was about 3 times higher in cisplatin-resistant renal cancer cells than
in cisplatin-sensitive renal cancer cells.

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Umehara et al. (2003) found that CROP
interacted with SF2 (SFRS1; 600812), an arginine/serine-rich RNA
splicing protein, as well as with itself. The arginine/glutamate-rich
and arginine/serine-rich domains of CROP were necessary for both its
intranuclear speckled distribution and the protein-protein interactions.
CROP was phosphorylated by mouse Srpk1 (601939), mouse Srpk2 (602980),
and Clk1 (601951) in vitro. The subnuclear distribution of
fluorescence-labeled CROP changed following cisplatin treatment,
suggesting that cisplatin affects RNA splicing by changing the
subnuclear distribution of serine/arginine-rich proteins, including
CROP.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Consortium mapped the LUC7L3 gene to
chromosome 17 (TMAP SHGC-2641).

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a consensus sequence of a mouse zinc finger motif as probe,
Pannuti et al. (1988) obtained a partial clone of ZNF3, which they
called cHF.12, from a placenta cDNA library. ZNF3 has at least 6 finger
repeats. Northern blot analysis of mRNA from cell lines of various
tissue origin showed ubiquitous expression of a 3.5-kb transcript.
Expression of ZNF3 was drastically reduced upon terminal differentiation
of 2 human myeloid cell lines.

MAPPING

Using a cDNA probe isolated from a human liver cDNA library by means of
a mouse DNA segment containing multiple copies of a 7-amino acid zinc
finger domain, for the study of human-hamster cell hybrids, Archidiacono
et al. (1989) showed that one sequence identified by probe A8-51 is
located on chromosome 5.

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the ZNF3
gene to chromosome 7 (TMAP WI-30599).

;;PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE 2A, REGULATORY SUBUNIT B-PRIME;;
PHOSPHOTYROSYL PHOSPHATASE ACTIVATOR; PTPA;;
PR53
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

PPP2R4, or PTPA, encodes a specific phosphotyrosyl phosphatase activator
of the dimeric form of protein phosphatase-2A (PP2A; see 176915) (Van
Hoof et al., 1995).

GENE FUNCTION

The core component of PP2A consists of a catalytic (C) subunit (e.g.,
PPP2CA; 176915) and a scaffold protein (A) subunit (e.g., PPP2R1A;
605983). Using purified recombinant proteins, Chao et al. (2006) found
that PTPA and PP2A A-C dimers constituted a composite ATPase, and the
interaction was independent of ATP or magnesium ion. The inclusion of
PTPA altered the substrate specificity of PP2A, with enhanced
phosphotyrosine phosphatase activity and decreased phosphoserine
phosphatase activity.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Chao et al. (2006) reported the 1.9-angstrom crystal structure of human
PTPA, which revealed a fold consisting of a core, a lid, and an extended
linker joining the core and lid. Structural analysis uncovered a highly
conserved surface patch bordering these 3 subdomains, as well as an
associated deep pocket between the core and linker subdomains. Further
analysis showed that the surface patch binds the PP2A A-C dimer, and the
deep pocket binds ATP.

GENE STRUCTURE

Van Hoof et al. (1995) demonstrated that human PTPA is encoded by a
single-copy gene composed of 10 exons and 9 introns with a total length
of about 60 kb. The 5-prime flanking sequence of the transcription start
site was analyzed for its potential as a promoter. This region lacks a
TATA sequence in the appropriate position relative to the transcription
start. However, this region is very GC-rich and contains 4 Sp1 sites
(SP1; 189906) upstream of the transcription start site, a feature common
to many TATA-less promoters. Based on homology with DNA-binding
consensus sequences of transcription factors, Van Hoof et al. (1995)
identified several additional putative transcription factor binding
sites in the promoter region. Transfection experiments with a construct
containing the PTPA promoter region inserted 5-prime of a luciferase
reporter gene demonstrated that the 5-prime flanking sequence of the
PTPA gene indeed has promoter activity that seems to be cell-line
dependent.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Van Hoof et al. (1995) mapped the
PTPA gene to 9q34. Fluorescence in situ analysis of metaphase
chromosomes of patients bearing the Philadelphia chromosome indicated
that PTPA is positioned centromeric of ABL1 (189980) and probably is not
involved in chronic myeloid leukemia.

MONOCYTE CHEMOTACTIC PROTEIN 2; MCP2
DESCRIPTION Chemokines, a family of small cytokines, attract leukocytes and possess
various immunomodulating functions. The C-C chemokines, which Van
Coillie et al. (1997) stated to be located on 17q11.2, influence
mononuclear cell types. Van Damme et al. (1992) isolated MCP2 from
stimulated osteosarcoma cells, determined its nearly complete amino acid
sequence, and identified it as a monocyte chemotactic factor based on a
pattern of conserved cysteine residues. By degenerate PCR with primers
based on C-C chemokine consensus sequences, Van Coillie et al. (1997)
isolated the MCP2 gene from a YAC contig from human chromosome 17q11.2.
Van Coillie et al. (1997) stated that the MCP2 gene contains 3 exons in
a span of about 3 kb and encodes a predicted 109-amino acid protein. The
mature MCP2 protein is approximately 75 amino acids long Van Damme et
al. (1992). Van Coillie et al. (1997) deduced that intron/exon structure
was conserved among MCP1 (158105), MCP2, and MCP3 (158106), and reported
that these genes share 77% coding nucleotide sequence homology. Van
Coillie et al. (1997) stated that the predicted protein sequence matches
the sequence of purified mature MCP2 reported by Van Damme et al. (1992)
with the exception of 1 lysine-to-glutamine change, which Van Coillie et
al. (1997) considered a polymorphism or cloning artifact. By Northern
blot analysis, Van Coillie et al. (1997) detected a major 1-kb
transcript in most tissues tested, with greatest expression in small
intestine and peripheral blood cells. Transcripts of 1.5 and 2.4 kb were
also observed.

606290	TITLE *606290 PROTOCADHERIN-GAMMA, SUBFAMILY A, MEMBER 3; PCDHGA3
;;PCDH-GAMMA-A3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Cadherins are calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion molecules, and
protocadherins constitute a subfamily of nonclassic cadherins. PCDHGA3
is 1 of 22 tandemly arranged genes within the PCDHG gene cluster
(604968) on chromosome 5q31. The 22 PCDHG genes function as 'variable'
exons that are individually spliced to a downstream constant region to
form distinct PCDHG transcripts. The variable PCDHG exons encode the
extracellular and transmembrane domains of the protocadherin protein,
and the common region encodes the intracellular domain (Wu et al.,
2001). For further information on the PCDHG genes, see 604968.

CLONING

Using PCR on a brain cDNA library, Wu and Maniatis (1999) obtained cDNAs
encoding 2 isoforms of PCDHGA3. Sequence analysis predicted that the
long isoform of PCDHGA3 contains 932 amino acids (GenBank GENBANK
AAD43717) and is 48% identical to PCDHGC4 (606305). The C-terminal 134
amino acids of PCDHGA3 and PCDHGC4 are identical and have a lysine-rich
motif. PCDHGA3 has a signal peptide, 4 putative N-linked glycosylation
sites, and 6 cadherin ectodomains.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Wu et al. (2001) mapped the PCDHGA3 gene
to chromosome 5q31, between the PCDHGA2 gene (606289) and the PCDHGB1
gene (606299). They localized the mouse PCDHG genes to chromosome 18c.

608072	TITLE *608072 NHL REPEAT-CONTAINING 1 GENE; NHLRC1
;;EPM2B GENE; EPM2B;;
MALIN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The NHLRC1 gene encodes malin, a single subunit E3 ubiquitin (UBB;
191339) ligase, which contains a RING-HC-type zinc finger and 6 NHL
domains and is subclassified as a member of the RING-HCa family (Gentry
et al., 2005).

CLONING

Within an 840-kb region on chromosome 6p22.3 in which the putative EPM2B
locus for Lafora disease (254780) was mapped, Chan et al. (2003)
identified a single-exon gene, termed NHLRC1. The gene is predicted to
encode a 395-amino acid protein, termed malin ('mal' for seizure in
French), containing a zinc finger of the RING type and 6 NHL-repeat
protein-protein interaction domains. The presence of the RING finger
predicts an E3 ubiquitin ligase function. Northern blot analysis
indicated 2 transcripts of 1.5 kb and 2.4 kb in all tissues examined,
including multiple subregions of the brain. In cultured cells, malin was
localized at the endoplasmic reticulum and, to a lesser extent, in the
nucleus. These results were similar to those observed for laforin
(EPM2A; 607566).

MAPPING

Chan et al. (2003) identified the NHLRC1 gene between markers D6S1688
and D6S1567 on chromosome 6p22.3.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid screen of a human brain cDNA library, Gentry et al.
(2005) found that malin directly bound and interacted with laforin in
HEK293T cells in vivo. Laforin is polyubiquitinated in a malin-dependent
manner, which leads to laforin degradation. Ubiquitination depended on
malin's RING domain but not on its NHL domains, whereas the NHL domains
functioned as a substrate-interacting motif to bind laforin. Mutations
in the NHLRC1 gene abolished both laforin polyubiquitination and
degradation. Gentry et al. (2005) concluded that malin is a
single-subunit E3 ligase, that laforin is a malin substrate, and that
malin regulates laforin protein concentration. They further suggested
that mutations in the NHLRC1 gene resulting in loss of the E3 ligase
activity of malin underlie the onset of Lafora disease.

Lohi et al. (2005) showed that laforin is a GSK3B (605004) ser9
phosphatase, and therefore capable of inactivating glycogen synthase
(GYS1; 138570) through GSK3. Laforin also interacted with malin, which
has been shown to bind GYS1. The authors proposed that laforin, in
response to appearance of polyglucosans, directs 2 negative feedback
pathways: polyglucosan-laforin-GSK3-GYS1 to inhibit GYS1 activity and
polyglucosan-laforin-malin-GYS1 to remove GYS1 through proteasomal
degradation.

Cori disease (232400) is a glycogen storage disease characterized by
deficiency of the glycogen debranching enzyme AGL (610860). Cheng et al.
(2007) showed that malin interacted with mouse Agl and promoted its
ubiquitination. Transfection studies in HepG2 cells showed that Agl was
cytoplasmic, whereas malin was predominantly nuclear. However, after
depletion of glycogen stores, about 90% of transfected cells exhibited
partial nuclear Agl staining. Elevation of cAMP increased malin levels
and malin/Agl complex formation. Cheng et al. (2007) concluded that
ubiquitination of AGL may play a role in the pathophysiology of both
Lafora disease and Cori disease.

Mittal et al. (2007) showed that laforin and malin were recruited to
aggresomes upon proteasomal blockade, possibly to clear misfolded
proteins through the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). Garyali et al.
(2009) tested this possibility using a variety of cytotoxic misfolded
proteins, including the expanded polyglutamine protein, as potential
substrates. Laforin and malin, together with Hsp70 (HSPA1A; 140550) as a
functional complex, suppressed the cellular toxicity of misfolded
proteins; all 3 members of the complex were required for this function.
Laforin and malin interacted with misfolded proteins and promoted their
degradation through the UPS, and they were recruited to the
polyglutamine aggregates and reduced the frequency of aggregate-positive
cells. Garyali et al. (2009) suggested that the malin-laforin complex is
a novel player in the neuronal response to misfolded proteins.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 34 probands with Lafora disease, Chan et al. (2003) identified 17
different mutations in the NHLRC1 gene in 26 families, including 8
deletions, 1 insertion, 7 missense changes, and 1 nonsense change (see,
e.g., 608072.0001). Eighteen families were homozygous and 8 were
compound heterozygous for the mutations.

Gomez-Abad et al. (2005) identified 18 mutations, including 12 novel
mutations, in the malin gene (see, e.g., 608072.0005-608072.0007) in 23
of 25 patients with Lafora disease who did not have mutations in the
laforin gene. P69A (608072.0002) was the predominant mutation,
identified in 14 chromosomes from 9 unrelated patients; haplotype
analysis suggested a founder effect for only 2 of these families.

Singh et al. (2005) identified 6 different mutations in the NHLRC1 gene
in 5 of 8 Japanese families with Lafora disease. Another Japanese family
had a mutation in the EPM2A gene, and 2 Japanese families did not have
mutations in either gene. Singh et al. (2005) concluded that mutations
in the NHLRC1 gene are a common cause of Lafora disease in Japan.

Singh et al. (2006) identified 7 different mutations, including 2 novel
mutations, in the NHLRC1 gene in affected members of 8 families with
Lafora disease. The authors stated that 39 different mutations had been
identified in the NHLRC1 gene.

ANIMAL MODEL

More than 5% of purebred miniature wirehaired dachshunds (MWHDs) in the
United Kingdom suffer an autosomal recessive progressive myoclonic
epilepsy (PME), which Lohi et al. (2005) showed to be Lafora disease
(254780). Using homozygosity and linkage analysis, they mapped the MWHD
disease locus to canine chromosome 35, which is syntenic in its entirety
to human 6p25-p21. They then cloned canine Epm2b (NHLRC1). PCR
identified a repeat region in affected dogs and revealed biallelic
expansion of the dodecamer repeat with 19 to 26 copies of the D
sequence. Comparing the amount of Epm2b mRNA in skeletal muscle from 3
affected dogs and 2 controls with quantitative RT-PCR showed that
affected mRNA levels were more than 900 times reduced. To determine
whether the extra D sequence is specific to MWHDs, Lohi et al. (2005)
sequenced Epm2b from 2 normal unrelated dogs from each of 128 breeds.
Sixty percent of their chromosomes had 3 repeats (2 Ds and 1 T) and 40%,
2 repeats (1 D and 1 T). Almost all breeds had examples of both variants
in homozygous or heterozygous state. They tested the next non-MWHD PME
case to present to the clinic, a basset hound, and found a homozygous
14-copy expansion of the repeat. Lohi et al. (2005) devised a test to
detect and counteract the mutant allele through controlled breeding.

In 4 French-Canadian families with Lafora disease (254780), Chan et al.
(2003) identified a homozygous 76T-A change in the NHLRC1 gene,
resulting in a cys26-to-ser (C26S) substitution in one of the 7
conserved cysteine residues critical for the zinc-binding ability of the
RING finger. Haplotype analysis indicated a founder effect. Singh et al.
(2006) devised a DNA-based diagnostic test to specifically screen for
the C26S mutation in patients with Lafora disease.

In 3 families with Lafora disease (254780), Chan et al. (2003)
identified a homozygous 205C-G change in the NHLRC1 gene, resulting in a
pro69-to-ala (P69A) substitution. Four additional affected families had
the P69A mutation in compound heterozygosity with another mutation.

Gomez-Abad et al. (2005) identified the P69A mutation in 14 chromosomes
from 9 unrelated patients with Lafora disease; haplotype analysis
suggested a founder effect for only 2 of these families. One patient who
was homozygous for the mutation presented with hepatic failure and did
not develop neurologic symptoms. The P69A mutation is located in the

607908	TITLE *607908 LIM AND SENESCENT CELL ANTIGEN-LIKE DOMAINS 2; LIMS2
;;PARTICULARLY INTERESTING NEW CYS-HIS PROTEIN 2; PINCH2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

LIMS2 is a focal adhesion protein that associates with integrin-linked
kinase (ILK; 602366), a multidomain protein that mediates multiple
protein-protein interactions at adhesion sites between cells and the
extracellular matrix (ECM).

CLONING

By searching databases for homologs of C. elegans Pin2, followed by
RT-PCR of rhabdomyosarcoma cell line mRNA, Zhang et al. (2002) cloned
LIMS2, which they called PINCH2. The deduced protein contains 5 LIM
domains and has a calculated molecular mass of almost 39 kD. LIMS2
shares 82% amino acid identity with LIMS1 (602567). Western blot
analysis of lung fibroblasts detected endogenous LIMS2 at an apparent
molecular mass of about 39 kD. Endogenous protein was detected in all
cell lines examined and was expressed at focal adhesions and in the
nucleus.

GENE FUNCTION

Zhang et al. (2002) determined that LIMS2 forms a complex with ILK and
that the interaction requires the first LIM domain (LIM1) of LIMS2. A
LIM1-deletion mutant, unlike wildtype LIMS2, was incapable of localizing
to cell-ECM contact sites, suggesting that ILK binding is required for
this association. Zhang et al. (2002) showed that LIMS2-ILK and
LIMS1-ILK interactions are mutually exclusive. Overexpression of LIMS2
in a mouse myoblast cell line inhibited the interaction between LIMS1
and ILK and reduced cell spreading and migration in rat embryo
fibroblasts.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Zhang et al. (2002) mapped the LIMS2 gene
to chromosome 2q14.3.

605675	TITLE *605675 RING FINGER PROTEIN 14; RNF14
;;ANDROGEN RECEPTOR-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 54; ARA54
DESCRIPTION The RING finger motif is a unique zinc-chelating domain involved in
mediating protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions. Using the
sequence of the partial cDNA clone HFB30 isolated by Ueki et al. (1998)
to screen a human fetal brain cDNA library, Ueki et al. (1999) cloned
the full-length cDNA, which encoded a novel ring finger protein, RNF14.
The deduced 474-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of
approximately 53 kD. RT-PCR analysis revealed ubiquitous expression of
RNF14 in a wide variety of human tissues.

Kang et al. (1999) independently cloned RNF14, which they called ARA54
(androgen receptor-associated protein-54), by a yeast 2-hybrid screen of
a prostate cDNA library. Northern blot analysis detected a major 3-kb
transcript, with highest expression in testis, followed by thymus,
spleen, colon, prostate, and uterus. Low expression was detected in
small intestine and blood leukocytes. The RNF14 transcript was also
strongly detected in 2 other prostate cell lines. A second transcript of
2 kb was detected in testis only. Kang et al. (1999) demonstrated that
RNF14 can function as a coactivator for androgen-dependent transcription
on both wildtype and mutant androgen receptor (313700). They also showed
that in the presence of a certain amount of 17-beta-estradiol or
hydroxyflutamide, the transcriptional activity of a specific AR mutant
was significantly enhanced, whereas that of wildtype and another AR
mutant was not. The authors suggested that both RNF14 and the positions
of the AR mutation might contribute to the specificity of AR-mediated
transactivation.

Ueki et al. (1999) determined that the RNF14 gene contains 9 exons and
spans approximately 20 kb of genomic DNA. By somatic cell hybrid and
radiation hybrid analyses, Ueki et al. (1999) mapped the RNF14 gene to
chromosome 5q23.3-q31.1.

610094	TITLE *610094 DEF6, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF; DEF6
;;IRF4-BINDING PROTEIN; IBP;;
SWAP70-LIKE ADAPTOR OF T CELLS; SLAT
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

DEF6, or IBP, is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for RAC
(602048) and CDC42 (116952) that is highly expressed in B and T cells
(Gupta et al., 2003).

CLONING

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis to identify IRF4 (601900)-binding proteins,
followed by PCR of a lymph node cDNA library, Gupta et al. (2003) cloned
DEF6, which they termed IBP. The predicted protein contains 631 amino
acids and has a calculated molecular mass of 74 kD. It shares 92% amino
acid identity with its mouse homolog and 45% identity with SWAP70
(604762). IBP has an N-terminal EF-hand motif, a central pleckstrin
(173570) homology (PH) domain containing a potential bipartite basic
nuclear localization signal, and a C-terminal alpha-helical DBL (311030)
homology (DH) region. Western blot analysis showed an approximately
75-kD protein in T and B cells, but not fibroblasts. Northern blot
analysis revealed abundant expression of a 2.4-kb transcript in all
lymphoid tissues examined except fetal liver. Immunofluorescence
microscopy demonstrated expression in tonsillar T cells and in coronal B
cells, but not in germinal center B cells or macrophages.

GENE FUNCTION

By Western blot and mutation analyses, Gupta et al. (2003) found that
T-cell receptor (TCR; see 186970) stimulation resulted in LCK
(153390)-mediated phosphorylation of IBP at tyr210. Pull-down analysis
showed that phosphorylated IBP bound the PI3K (see 171834) product,
PI(3,4,5)P3, in a manner dependent on arg236 in its PH domain.
Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated LCK- and PI3K-dependent
recruitment of IBP to the immunologic synapse and colocalization of IBP
with TCR/CD3. Western blot and pull-down analyses showed that the
C-terminal DH domain of IBP catalyzed GEF activity toward RAC1 and
CDC42.

Using immunoblot analysis and confocal microscopy, Tanaka et al. (2003)
found that mouse Def6, which they called Slat, was selectively expressed
on T helper-2 (Th2) cell membranes after TCR signaling and colocalized
with Tcrb (see 186930) and, in part, with talin (TLN1; 186745) in the
immunologic synapse. Overexpression of Slat, with or without TCR
stimulation, increased Il4 (147780) and reduced Ifng (147570)
expression. Immunoprecipitation analysis showed that Slat interacted
with Zap70 (176947) and selectively inhibited its signaling. Tanaka et
al. (2003) concluded that Slat plays a role in Th2 differentiation,
activation, and/or expansion.

GENE STRUCTURE

Gupta et al. (2003) determined that the IBP gene contains 11 exons and
spans 23.5 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Gupta et al. (2003) mapped the DEF6 gene
to chromosome 6p21.31, centromeric to the major histocompatibility
complex. The mouse gene maps to chromosome 17 in region that shows
homology of synteny to human chromosome 6p21.31.

ANIMAL MODEL

Fanzo et al. (2006) found that Ibp -/- mice were viable and fertile and
showed no differences in size or lymphoid development compared with
wildtype mice. However, after 5 months of age, the majority of Ibp -/-
female mice developed enlarged cervical lymph nodes and splenomegaly
with markedly elevated serum levels of IgG, particularly IgG1. Female
Ibp -/- mice also displayed high titers of antinuclear and
anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies and other features similar to human
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE; 152700). Male mice rarely developed
lymphadenopathy, and if they did, it was only after 15 months of age.
Flow cytometry demonstrated accumulation of effector/memory T cells in
Ibp -/- mice resulting from a defective ability of these T cells to
undergo apoptosis. Fanzo et al. (2006) concluded that IBP is a novel
type of Rho GTPase activator that is required for optimal T-cell
effector function, homeostasis, and prevention of systemic autoimmune
disease.

Becart et al. (2007) found that Slat -/- mice had a developmental defect
at an early thymocyte differentiation stage, the double negative-1 (DN1)
stage, leading to decreased T-cell numbers. Slat -/- mice showed
deficient Th1- and Th2-mediated lung inflammatory responses, accompanied
by lower levels of Th1 and Th2 cytokines in lungs. In vitro analysis
revealed a severe reduction in Ca(2+) mobilization from endoplasmic
reticulum stores, leading to defective translocation of Nfatc1 (600489)
and Nfatc2 (600490). Becart et al. (2007) concluded that SLAT is
required for thymic DN1 cell expansion, T-cell activation, and Th1/Th2
inflammatory responses.

Chen et al. (2008) generated TCR transgenic Ibp -/- mice and observed
rapid development of rheumatoid arthritis-like joint disease and large
vessel vasculitis. The pathology was associated with an accumulation of
TCR transgene-positive T cells that exhibited enhanced responsiveness to
low levels of stimulation and aberrant expression of both Il17 (603149)
and Il21 (605384). The aberrant cytokine production resulted from a lack
of Irf4 regulation due to the loss of Ibp sequestration of Irf4. Chen et
al. (2008) concluded that IBP is important in preventing T cell-mediated
autoimmunity by ensuring that IL17 and IL21 are not produced in response
to self-antigens.

602309	TITLE *602309 TUBBY-LIKE PROTEIN 2; TULP2
DESCRIPTION Mice homozygous for a splicing defect in the C terminus of the 'tubby'
gene (tub) show progressive retinal and cochlear degeneration,
maturation-onset diabetes with insulin resistance, and impaired glucose
tolerance. Database searches revealed that sequences corresponding to
the C terminus of the tub protein are highly conserved across a number
of species, including humans, mice, C. elegans, Arabidopsis, rice, and
maize, and that tub is a member of a gene family. North et al. (1997)
described TUB (601197), the human homolog of mouse tub, and 2 new family
members, TULP1 (for tubby-like protein 1; 602280) and TULP2. These 3
genes, which differ in the N-terminal half of the protein, share 60 to
90% amino acid identity across their conserved C-terminal region and
have distinct tissue expression patterns. North et al. (1997) showed
that TULP2 maps to 19q13.1 by radiation hybrid mapping.

609474	TITLE *609474 NEURONAL PENTRAXIN RECEPTOR; NPTXR
;;NPR
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Dodds et al. (1997) cloned rat Nptxr, which they called Npr. The deduced
494-amino acid protein is translated from an initiating CTG codon. Npr
contains 3 potential N-glycosylation sites and an N-terminal
transmembrane stretch. It shares significant homology with Np1 (NPTX1;
602367) and Np2 (NPTX2; 600750), particularly in its C-terminal half,
which includes the calcium binding residues and pentraxin signature
sequence. As with Np1 and Np2, Npr shares homology with C-reactive
protein (CRP; 123260) and serum amyloid P protein (APCS; 104770).
Northern blot analysis detected highest expression of a 5.5-kb
transcript in brain and cerebellum. In situ hybridization showed highest
expression in Purkinje and granule neurons of cerebellum and in CA3
neurons of hippocampus. Npr expression was lower in other brain regions.
SDS-PAGE detected 55- and 65-kD Npr proteins, and deglycosylation
experiments indicated that the size variation was only partly due to
glycosylation.

GENE FUNCTION

Dodds et al. (1997) demonstrated that rat Npr bound tightly to the
presynaptic-acting snake venom neurotoxin, taipoxin, and to Np1, Np2,
and Tcbp49 (RCN2; 602584).

Kirkpatrick et al. (2000) found that rat Npr did not bind taipoxin or
Tcbp49 directly. However, Npr could form heteropentamers with Np1 or Np2
that could be released from cell membranes by proteolysis.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the NPTXR
gene to chromosome 22 (TMAP WI-19878).

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Kikuchi et al. (1988) isolated a gene from a yeast genomic library that
could complement a temperature-sensitive mutant of Saccharomyces
cerevisiae. The gene, termed GST1, seemed to be essential for the G1- to
S-phase transition in the yeast cell cycle. The gene product appeared to
be a GTP-binding protein of molecular mass 76,565 Da with 38% identity
in amino acid sequence with the alpha subunit of elongation factor-1
(130590). Hoshino et al. (1989) cloned the human equivalent from a cDNA
library.

Hoshino et al. (1998) cloned mouse Gspt1. The deduced 635-amino acid
protein has a unique N terminus and a conserved C-terminal eukaryotic
elongation factor-1-alpha-like domain. The mouse and human Gspt1
proteins share 94% sequence identity. RT-PCR analysis indicated
expression of Gspt1 in all mouse tissues examined.

GENE FUNCTION

Eukaryotic RF1 (ETF1; 600285) and RF3 are involved in translation
termination. In vitro, RF1 catalyzes the release of the polypeptide
chain without any stop codon specificity; the GTP-binding protein RF3
confers GTP dependence to the termination process and stimulates RF1
activity. Le Goff et al. (1997) used tRNA-mediated nonsense suppression
of different stop codons in a CAT reporter gene to analyze the
polypeptide chain release factor activities of recombinant human RF1 and
RF3 proteins overexpressed in human cells. Using a CAT assay, they
measured the competition between the suppressor tRNA and the release
factors when a stop codon was present in the ribosomal A site.
Regardless of which of the 3 stop codons was present in the CAT open
reading frame, the overexpression of RF1 alone markedly decreased
translational read-through by suppressor tRNA. Thus, Le Goff et al.
(1997) concluded that RF1 has intrinsic antisuppressor activity. The
levels of antisuppression when both RF1 and RF3 were overexpressed were
almost the same as those when RF1 was overexpressed alone, suggesting
that RF1-RF3 complex-mediated termination may be controlled by the
expression level of RF1. Overexpression of RF3 alone had an inhibitory
effect on CAT gene expression. CAT mRNA stability studies suggested that
RF3 inhibits gene expression at the transcriptional level. Le Goff et
al. (1997) suggested that RF3 may perform other functions, including the
stimulation of RF1 activity, in vivo.

Hoshino et al. (1998) found that expression of Gspt1 by Swiss 3T3 cells
increased with serum or phorbol ester stimulation. By
coimmunoprecipitation and yeast 2-hybrid analyses, they found
interaction between mouse Gspt1 and human eRF1. Hoshino et al. (1998)
hypothesized that Gspt1, in a binary complex with eRF1, functions as a
polypeptide chain release factor.

Alkalaeva et al. (2006) reconstituted eukaryotic translation initiation,
elongation, and termination processes in vitro on a model mRNA encoding
a tetrapeptide followed by a UAA stop codon using individual 40S and 60S
ribosomal subunits and the complete set of individual initiation,
elongation, and release factors. They found that binding of human ERF1
and ERF3A and GTP to the ribosomal pretermination complex induced a
structural rearrangement characterized by a 2-nucleotide forward shift
of the toeprint attributed to the pretermination complex. Subsequent GTP
hydrolysis was required for rapid hydrolysis of peptidyl tRNA in the
pretermination complex. Cooperativity between ERF1 and ERF3A in ensuring
fast peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis required the ERF3A-binding C-terminal
domain of ERF1.

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen and in vitro and in vivo binding assays,
including reciprocal immunoprecipitation assays, Tompkins et al. (2006)
showed that GSPT1 bound the p19(ARF) isoform of CDKN2A (600160), but not
the p16(INK4A) isoform.

MAPPING

By nonradioactive in situ hybridization, Ozawa et al. (1992) mapped the
GSPT1 gene, the human homolog of the yeast gene GST1, to human
chromosome 16p13.1. Southern blot hybridization with a panel of
human-rodent somatic cells confirmed the localization of the GSPT1 gene
on chromosome 16 and also showed the existence of a homologous gene on
the X chromosome (GSPT2; 300418). They pointed out that a breakpoint for
nonrandom chromosome rearrangements has been found in the region of
GSPT1 in patients with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia.

;;NEGATIVE REGULATOR OF TRANSCRIPTION 1, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF;
NOT1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The yeast CCR4-NOT protein complex is a global regulator of RNA
polymerase II transcription. It is comprised, in part, of CCR4 (see
608951), NOT1 to NOT5, and CAF1 (CNOT7; 604913). By searching sequence
databases, Albert et al. (2000) identified human ESTs encoding homologs
of yeast NOT1, NOT2 (CNOT2; 604909), NOT3 (CNOT3; 604910), NOT4 (CNOT4;
604911), and CAF1. The human NOT1 ESTs contained partial coding
sequences. In their studies, the authors used a partial NOT1 cDNA, which
they referred to as NOT1C, that was obtained by 5-prime extending a NOT1
EST. The NOT1C cDNA encodes an N-terminally truncated protein of
approximately 1,300 amino acids that corresponds to two-thirds of the
predicted NOT1 protein. Northern blot analysis detected an approximately
8-kb major NOT1 transcript in all human tissues examined, namely brain,
heart, lung, liver, kidney, small intestine, colon, spleen, thymus,
peripheral blood leukocytes, skeletal muscle, and placenta. Like the
expression of human NOT2, NOT3, and CALIF, NOT1 expression was high in
brain, kidney, and placenta and very low in skeletal muscle and colon.

GENE FUNCTION

Using the yeast 2-hybrid assay, Albert et al. (2000) demonstrated that
human NOT1C could interact with human NOT2, NOT4, and CALIF (603731),
but not with human NOT3, mouse Caf1, or itself.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Type I protein arginine N-methyltransferases (PRMTs), such as PRMT3,
catalyze the formation of asymmetric N(G),N(G)-dimethylarginine (ADMA)
residues in proteins (Tang et al., 1998).

CLONING

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen to identify proteins that interact with
rat Prmt1 (see 602950), Tang et al. (1998) isolated cDNAs encoding rat
Prmt3. The C-terminal region of the deduced protein, which contains the
putative methyltransferase domain, is 46% identical to Prmt1. The
N-terminal 194-amino acid portion is rich in acidic residues and
contains a putative zinc finger motif. Immunofluorescence experiments
localized Prmt3 predominantly to the cytoplasm of mammalian cells. By
searching an EST database, Tang et al. (1998) identified a partial cDNA
encoding the human homolog of Prmt3. The predicted human PRMT3 protein,
which is missing the first 16 N-terminal amino acids, is 90% identical
to rat Prmt3.

GENE FUNCTION

Tang et al. (1998) found that recombinant rat Prmt3 exhibited type I
PRMT activity.

CLONING

By genomic sequence analysis, Katoh and Katoh (2005) identified EFHA2
based on its close linkage to FGF20 (605558).

GENE STRUCTURE

Katoh and Katoh (2005) determined that the EFAH2 gene contains 15 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Katoh and Katoh (2005) mapped the EFHA2
gene to chromosome 8p22 in a head-to-head orientation with the FGF20
gene. The interval between the genes is approximately 25 kb. Katoh and
Katoh (2005) determined that the FGF20-EFHA2 locus and the FGF9

602859	TITLE *602859 PEROXISOME BIOGENESIS FACTOR 10; PEX10
;;PEROXIN 10
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Warren et al. (1998) identified the human ortholog of yeast PEX10.
Okumoto et al. (1998) isolated a human PEX10 cDNA by an expressed
sequence tag (EST) homology search of a human DNA database using yeast
Pex10 from Hansenula polymorpha, followed by screening of a human liver
cDNA library. This cDNA encodes a peroxisomal protein comprising 326
amino acids with 2 putative transmembrane segments and a C3HC4 zinc
finger RING motif. Both the N- and C-terminal regions of the PEX10
protein are exposed to the cytosol, as assessed by an expression study
of epitope-tagged PEX10 protein.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

The peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs) are a group of genetically
heterogeneous, lethal diseases that are characterized by neuronal,
hepatic, and renal abnormalities and severe mental retardation; in their
most severe form, death occurs within the first year of life. Cells from
all PBD patients exhibit decreased import of one or more classes of
peroxisome matrix proteins, a phenotype shared by yeast Pex mutants.
Warren et al. (1998) observed that Pex10 expression rescued peroxisomal
matrix-protein import in PBD patients' fibroblasts from complementation
group 7 (CG7). In addition, they detected mutations on both copies of
PEX10 in 2 unrelated CG7 patients. A Zellweger syndrome (PBD6A; 614870)
patient was homozygous for a donor splice site mutation (602859.0001). A
more mildly affected neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy (PBD6B; 614871)
patient was a compound heterozygote for a missense mutation and a
nonsense mutation (602859.0002).

Okumoto et al. (1998) showed that PEX10 expression morphologically and
biochemically restored peroxisome biogenesis in fibroblasts from
Zellweger patients of the complementation group called B in Japan and 7
in the U.S. One patient was found to be homozygous for an inactivating
mutation, a 2-bp deletion immediately upstream of the RING motif, which
resulted in a frameshift, altering 65 amino acids from the normal. This
implied that the C-terminal part, including the RING finger, is required
for biologic function of the PEX10 protein. PEX10 cDNA derived from the
patient with the mutation was defective in peroxisome-restoring activity
when expressed in patient fibroblasts.

Warren et al. (2000) reported phenotype-genotype correlations in
patients with PEX10-deficient peroxisome biogenesis disorder. All 4
PEX10-deficient Zellweger syndrome patients were found to have nonsense,
frameshift, or splice site mutations that removed large portions of the
PEX10 coding region. In contrast, a more mildly affected PEX10-deficient
neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy patient expressed a PEX10 allele with a
missense mutation, H290Q (602859.0002), affecting the C-terminal
zinc-binding domain of the PEX10 product. These results supported the
hypothesis that severe loss-of-function mutations in PEX genes cause
more severe clinical phenotypes, whereas mildly affected PBD patients
have PEX gene mutations that retain residual function.

To quantitate the effects of PEX10 mutations, Warren et al. (2000) used
a functional complementation assay. They observed that nonsense and
frameshift mutations predicted to delete the C-terminal two-thirds
(R125X; 602859.0003) or one-third (704insA) of the protein displayed
nearly normal PEX10 activity. They also found that the unexpectedly high
PEX10 activity displayed by these cDNAs could be eliminated by removing
or mutating segments of the PEX10 cDNA downstream of the mutations.
Although these results demonstrated serious flaws in the PEX10
functional complementation assay, they suggested that the C-terminal
zinc-binding domain is critical for PEX10 function.

ANIMAL MODEL

Chen et al. (2010) reported that Drosophila pex mutants, including Pex2
(170993), Pex10, and Pex12 (601758), faithfully recapitulated several
key features of human PBD, including impaired peroxisomal protein
import, elevated very long chain fatty acid (VLCFA) levels, and growth
retardation. Moreover, disruption of pex function resulted in
spermatogenesis defects, including spermatocyte cytokinesis failure in
Drosophila. Increased VLCFA levels enhanced these spermatogenesis
defects whereas reduced VLCFA levels alleviated them. Chen et al. (2010)
concluded that regulation of proper VLCFA levels by pex genes is crucial
for spermatogenesis.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
PEROXISOME BIOGENESIS DISORDER 6A (ZELLWEGER)
PEX10, IVS, G-A, +1

In a patient with Zellweger syndrome of complementation group 7 (PBD6A;
614870), Warren et al. (1998) found homozygosity for a splice donor-site
mutation in the PEX10 gene that resulted in exon skipping and loss of
407 bp from the PEX10 open reading frame. The change was a G-to-A
transition in the first position of the splice-donor site in an intron
that lies downstream from a 407-bp exon. This mutation corresponded to a
C-to-T transition at a CpG dinucleotide on the antisense strand. The
homozygous nature of this allele, which destroyed an SnaBI site, was
confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion of an amplified genomic DNA
fragment spanning the mutation. The PEX10-deficient cells of this
patient contained many peroxisomes and imported peroxisomal membrane
proteins but did not import peroxisomal matrix proteins, indicating that
the loss of PEX10 has its most pronounced effect on peroxisomal matrix
protein import.

PEROXISOME BIOGENESIS DISORDER 6B
PEX10, HIS290GLN

In a mildly affected neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy (see PBD6B, 614871)
patient, Warren et al. (1998) found compound heterozygosity for a
missense mutation in the PEX10 zinc-binding domain, his290 to gln, and
for a nonsense mutation, arg125 to stop (602859.0003). The 2 alleles
encoded partially functional PEX10 proteins.

PEX10, 2-BP DEL, 814CT

In cells from a patient with Zellweger syndrome of complementation group
7 (PBD6A; 614870), Okumoto et al. (1998) found homozygosity for an
inactivating mutation, a 2-bp deletion at nucleotides 814 and 815 (CT).

The only diagnostic center for PBDs in Japan identified a total of 31
Japanese patients with PBD during the 20 years previous to the report of
Shimozawa et al. (2003). There were 27 patients with Zellweger syndrome,
including 2 sibs, 3 with neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy (NALD; see
601539), and 1 with rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata (RCDP; see
215100). No patient with infantile Refsum disease (IRD; see 601539) had
been detected. All 11 patients with Zellweger syndrome of
complementation group B had the same mutation, the homozygous 2-bp
deletion in PEX10: 814-815delCT. Analysis of single-nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) within PEX10 showed that the mutation probably
arose once on an ancestral chromosome in the Japanese population.

.0005
PEROXISOME BIOGENESIS DISORDER 6A (ZELLWEGER)
PEX10, 1 BP-INS, 704A

In a patient with Zellweger syndrome (PBD6A; 614870), their patient
PBD117, Warren et al. (2000) found compound heterozygosity for an A
insertion following nucleotide 704 in exon 4 of the PEX10 cDNA and a
deletion/insertion/frameshift mutation (602859.0006) in exon 1 of the
genome DNA, resulting in loss of nucleotides 13 to 28 of the open
reading frame and replacement of these 16 basepairs by a 20-bp
insertion. The product of the second allele contained the first 4 amino
acids of PEX10 followed by an additional 46 residues and a termination
codon; there was no evidence of PEX10 mRNA expression from the second
allele.

600744	TITLE *600744 T-CELL TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR EB; TFEB
;;TCFEB
TFEB/ALPHA FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Transcription factors of the basic helix-loop-helix zipper (bHLH-ZIP)
family contain a basic domain, used for DNA binding, and HLH and ZIP
domains, both used for oligomerization. TFEB was isolated from a human
B-cell cDNA library using a binding sequence from the adenovirus major
late promoter (Carr and Sharp, 1990).

MAPPING

By interspecific backcross analysis, Steingrimsson et al. (1995) mapped
the Tcfeb gene in the mouse to chromosome 17 in a region of homology to
human 6p21, which can be presumed to be the location of the human
homolog.

CYTOGENETICS

Argani et al. (2001) identified a class of renal tumors containing a
translocation t(6;11)(p21.1;q12). Whereas these tumors exhibited
epitheloid morphology suggestive of renal carcinoma, they were
distinctive in their nonimmunoreactivity for epithelial markers
(cytokeratin, epithelial membrane antigen) and positive immunoreactivity
for melanocytic markers. Davis et al. (2003) reported that TFEB is
targeted by this translocation in both of 2 tumors examined. TFEB fuses
with the Alpha gene at 11q13, an intronless gene that does not
contribute coding sequence to the fusion product. In the 2 primary
tumors the Alpha gene rearranged with the first intron of TFEB, just
upstream of TFEB's initiation ATG, preserving the entire TFEB coding
sequence. Fluorescence in situ hybridization confirmed the involvement
of both TFEB and Alpha in this translocation. Although the Alpha
promoter drives expression of this fusion gene, the Alpha gene does not
contribute to the ORF.

Whereas TFE3 (314310) is typically fused to partner proteins in subsets
of renal tumors, Davis et al. (2003) found that wildtype, unfused TFE3
stimulates clonogenic growth in a cell-based assay, suggesting that
dysregulated expression, rather than altered function of TFEB or TFE3
fusions, may confer neoplastic properties, a mechanism reminiscent of
MYC (190080) activation by promoter substitution in Burkitt lymphoma.
Alpha-TFEB is thus identified as a fusion gene in a subset of renal
neoplasms in children and young adults. Two patients studied by Davis et
al. (2003) were an 18-year-old female with a history of obesity,
hirsutism, and polycystic ovary syndrome. A right renal mass was
detected, and partial nephrectomy was performed. Postoperatively, she
was well without evidence of recurrent neoplastic disease and continued
to require spironolactone for control of hirsutism. The second patient
was an 18-year-old male with clinical details reported by Argani et al.
(2001).

Kuiper et al. (2003) collected 3 cases of renal cell carcinoma (RCC;
605074) from patients 14 to 42 years of age, wherein a t(6;11)(p21;q13)
translocation was the sole cytogenetic abnormality. Molecular analysis
revealed fusion of the TFEB gene on chromosome 6 to the Alpha gene
(607924) on chromosome 11. The Alpha/TFEB fusion gene linked all coding
exons of the TFEB gene to 5-prime upstream regulatory sequences of the
Alpha gene. Alpha/TFEB mRNA levels were significantly upregulated in
primary tumor cells as compared with wildtype TFEB mRNA levels in normal
kidney samples, resulting in a dramatic upregulation of TFEB protein
levels. The TFEB protein encoded by the Alpha/TFEB fusion gene was
efficiently targeted to the nucleus. Kuiper et al. (2003) speculated
that this resulted in severely unbalanced nuclear ratios of MITF
(156845)/TFE subfamily members and that this imbalance may lead to
changes in the expression of downstream target genes, ultimately
resulting in the development of RCC.

GENE FUNCTION

Sardiello et al. (2009) found that most lysosomal genes exhibit
coordinated transcription behavior and are regulated by the
transcription factor EB (TFEB). They found that 68 of 96 lysosomal genes
had a palindromic 10-bp GTCACGTGAC motif, either as a single sequence or
as tandem multiple copies, in the 5-prime untranslated region. Sardiello
et al. (2009) named this motif the Coordinated Lysosomal Expression and
Regulation (CLEAR) element. Under aberrant lysosomal storage conditions,
TFEB translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, resulting in the
activation of its target genes. TFEB overexpression in cultured cells
induced lysosomal biogenesis and increased degradation of complex
molecules such as glucosaminoglycans and polyQ-expanded huntingtin.

Settembre et al. (2011) found that starvation activates a
transcriptional program that controls major steps of the autophagic
pathway, including autophagosome formation, autophagosome-lysosome
fusion, and substrate degradation. The transcription factor EB, the
master gene for lysosomal biogenesis, coordinated this program by
driving expression of autophagy and lysosomal genes. Nuclear
localization and activity of TFEB were regulated by serine
phosphorylation mediated by the extracellular signal-regulated kinase-2
(ERK2; 176948), whose activity was tuned by the levels of extracellular
nutrients. Thus, Settembre et al. (2011) concluded that a
mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent mechanism regulates autophagy
by controlling the biogenesis and partnership of 2 distinct cellular
organelles.

605020	TITLE *605020 VISUAL SYSTEM HOMEOBOX GENE 1, ZEBRAFISH, HOMOLOG OF; VSX1
;;RETINAL INNER NUCLEAR LAYER HOMEOBOX; RINX
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Homeodomain transcription factors control cell fates during the
development of all animals. The 'paired-like' subfamily of homeodomain
proteins has been implicated in craniofacial and ocular development.
This family is characterized by a homeodomain that is related to the
homeodomain of the Drosophila 'paired' protein.

CLONING

By PCR of a human embryonic craniofacial cDNA library using degenerate
oligonucleotides based on highly conserved motifs within the paired-like
homeodomain, Semina et al. (2000) isolated a cDNA encoding VSX1. The
predicted 365-amino acid VSX1 protein contains a paired-like homeodomain
and a CVC domain. Human VSX1 shares 55% overall sequence identity with
the zebrafish and goldfish Vsx1 proteins and 35% overall identity with
the goldfish Vsx2 (CHX10; 142993) and mouse Chx10 proteins. PCR of a
panel of cDNA libraries detected VSX1 expression in embryonic
craniofacial, adult retina, and adult cornea libraries but not in adult
lens, embryonic or adult brain, heart, kidney, liver, lung, skeletal
muscle, spleen, or thymus libraries.

Using a yeast 1-hybrid screen of an adult bovine retinal cDNA library
with the conserved core of the red/green visual pigment locus control
region (see CBD; 303800) as bait, followed by RT-PCR of a human retinal
library, Hayashi et al. (2000) isolated a cDNA encoding VSX1, which they
termed RINX for 'retinal inner nuclear layer (INL) homeobox.' Hayashi et
al. (2000) also identified 5 splice variants of VSX1. RT-PCR analysis
indicated that the 2 major VSX1 transcripts are expressed in retina and
WERI, a retinoblastoma cell line expressing retinal cone genes, but not
in other tissues or in a rhodopsin-expressing retinoblastoma cell line.
Northern blot analysis detected a 2.0-kb main VSX1 transcript in retina
but not heart. In situ hybridization analysis of bovine retinal sections
demonstrated exclusive localization of VSX1 to cell nuclei in the middle
of the INL, likely belonging to bipolar cells.

Ohtoshi et al. (2001) cloned mouse Vsx1 by PCR of day 7.5 mouse embryo
cDNA using degenerate primers for paired-like homeobox genes. Mouse Vsx1
consists of 363 amino acid residues and contains a homeodomain and a CVC
domain. PCR detected expression of Vsx1 at very low levels during all
stages of embryogenesis. In adult retinal sections, Vsx1 was detected in
the outer half of the inner nuclear layer.

GENE STRUCTURE

The VSX1 gene spans approximately 6.2 kb and contains 5 exons (Semina et
al., 2000; Hayashi et al., 2000). Ohtoshi et al. (2001) determined that
the exon-intron structure of the human and mouse VSX1 genes is
completely conserved.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid mapping, Semina et al. (2000) mapped the VSX1 gene
to 20p11-q11. Hayashi et al. (2000) mapped the VSX1 gene to 20p11.2 by
radiation hybrid analysis.

Ohtoshi et al. (2001) mapped the mouse Vsx1 gene to the distal region of
chromosome 2.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Heon et al. (2002) identified mutations in the VSX1 homeobox gene for 2
distinct inherited human corneal dystrophies: posterior polymorphous
corneal dystrophy (PPCD1; 122000) and keratoconus (148300). One of the
mutations (R166W; 605020.0001) responsible for keratoconus altered the
homeodomain and impaired DNA binding. Two other sequence changes (L159M,
605020.0003 and G160D, 605020.0002) were associated with keratoconus and
PPCD1, respectively, and involved a region adjacent to the homeodomain.
The G160D substitution, and a fourth mutation (P247R; see 605020.0002)
affecting the highly conserved CVC domain, occurred in a child with very
severe PPCD1 who required a corneal transplant at 3 months of age. In
this family, relatives with the G160D change alone had mild to moderate
PPCD1, while P247R alone caused no corneal abnormalities. However, with
either mutation, electroretinography detected abnormal function of the
inner retina, where VSX1 is expressed.

Bisceglia et al. (2005) analyzed the VSX1 gene in 80 Italian patients
with keratoconus. They found 3 previously described missense changes
(see, e.g., 605020.0002) and a novel missense mutation (L17P;
605020.0005) in 7 (8.7%) of the 80 unrelated patients; they also found 2
previously undescribed intronic polymorphisms. The authors concluded
that the VSX1 gene plays an important role in a significant proportion
of autosomal dominant keratoconus cases.

In a case-control panel of 77 sporadic keratoconus patients and 71
controls and a keratoconus family panel involving 444 individuals from
75 families, Tang et al. (2008) screened for 3 keratoconus-associated
VSX1 mutations, L159M, R166W, and H244R. The R166W and H244R variants
were not found in the case-control panel, and L159M was detected in
heterozygosity in 1 control. In the family panel, R166W was not found;
L159M was detected in 3 affected and 2 unaffected individuals, and H244R
was detected in 2 affected and 1 unaffected individual. Tang et al.
(2008) concluded that their results did not support a role for variation
in the VSX1 gene in the pathogenesis of keratoconus.

Dash et al. (2010) analyzed the entire coding region, intron-exon
junctions, and 5- and 3-prime UTR of the VSX1 gene in 66 unrelated
patients with keratoconus, including 27 familial cases and 39 sporadic
cases. The G160D change (605020.0002), previously detected in a family
with PPCD1 and a family with keratoconus, was identified in 2 sporadic
keratoconus patients and was not found in controls; however, other
variants that were found did not segregate with disease and/or did not
demonstrate pathogenicity. Dash et al. (2010) concluded that VSX1 plays
a minor role in keratoconus pathogenesis.

Stabuc-Silih et al. (2010) analyzed the coding regions and intron-exon
junctions of the VSX1 gene in 113 unrelated Slovenian patients with
keratoconus, but identified no disease-causing mutations; they concluded
that other genetic factors are involved in the development of
keratoconus.

De Bonis et al. (2011) analyzed the VSX1 gene in 222 unrelated Italian
probands with keratoconus and reviewed previously published results. De
Bonis et al. (2011) found 1 novel and 3 previously identified VSX1
missense variants in 6 keratoconus patients, respectively (see, e.g.,
605020.0002 and 605020.0005), none of which had been found in controls.
They concluded that VSX1 has a possible pathogenic role in keratoconus,
although in a small number of patients.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
KERATOCONUS 1
VSX1, ARG166TRP

In an isolated patient with keratoconus-1 (148300), Heon et al. (2002)
reported heterozygosity for a missense mutation predicted to result in
an arg166-to-trp (R166W) substitution in the homeodomain of VSX1.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed decreased DNA binding by
the mutant protein.

.0002
CORNEAL DYSTROPHY, POSTERIOR POLYMORPHOUS, 1
KERATOCONUS 1, INCLUDED
VSX1, GLY160ASP

Heon et al. (2002) reported 4 sibs with moderate presentation of
posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy (PPCD1; 122000) who were
heterozygous for a missense mutation in the VSX1 gene. The mutation
resulted in a gly160-to-asp (G160D) substitution. An offspring of one
sib manifested severe PPCD1, and was found to have also inherited a
pro247-to-arg (P247R) mutation in the CVC domain of VSX1 from her
asymptomatic father. Neither mutation was found in over 200 control
individuals.

In a 27-year-old Italian woman who had bilateral keratoconus (KTCN1;
148300), Bisceglia et al. (2005) identified heterozygosity for the G160D
allele. The variant was also present in her affected father and brother,
but was absent from 2 other brothers who had suspected keratoconus by
videokeratographic examination.

Dash et al. (2010) identified the G160D change in 2 sporadic patients
with keratoconus; the variant was not found in 100 controls. Noting that
the G160 residue is not well conserved across species and that G160D is
predicted to be a benign change using the PolyPhen algorithm, Dash et
al. (2010) suggested that the G160D change might represent a rare
polymorphism or genetic modifier.

De Bonis et al. (2011) detected the G160D allele in a sporadic Italian
patient with keratoconus; the variant was not found in 200 controls.

.0003
RECLASSIFIED - VARIANT OF UNKNOWN SIGNIFICANCE
VSX1, LEU159MET

This variant, formerly titled KERATOCONUS 1, has been reclassified based
on the findings of Tang et al. (2008) and De Bonis et al. (2011).

In a 2-generation family with keratoconus-1 (148300), Heon et al. (2002)
identified heterozygosity for a leu159-to-met (L159M) mutation near the
nuclear localization signal of the VSX1 gene in affected individuals.
The authors speculated that the mutation may interfere with the binding
of Ubc9 (601661), which is required for nuclear localization.

Tang et al. (2008) detected heterozygosity for the L159M variant in 3
affected and 2 unaffected individuals from a family panel as well as in
1 control from a sporadic case-control panel, and concluded that the
L159M variant does not play a role in the pathogenesis of keratoconus.

After reviewing published studies, De Bonis et al. (2011) stated that
the L159M variant may be considered to be a polymorphism without
pathogenic significance.

.0004
CRANIOFACIAL ANOMALIES AND ANTERIOR SEGMENT DYSGENESIS SYNDROME
VSX1, ALA256SER

In an African American family with abnormal craniofacial features and
anterior segment developmental anomalies (614195), Mintz-Hittner et al.
(2004) found a heterozygous G-to-T transversion at codon 256 in the CVC
domain of the VSX1 protein that resulted in a change of an alanine to
serine (A256S). The mutation was predicted to result in a change of
conformation and therefore activity of the protein. The A256S mutation
segregated with the 4 affected patients and was not found in any of 624
control chromosomes.

.0005
KERATOCONUS 1
VSX1, LEU17PRO

In 3 families with keratoconus-1 (148300), Bisceglia et al. (2005) found
a heterozygous T-to-C transition at nucleotide 323 in exon 1 of the VSX1
gene that resulted in a leu-to-pro substitution at amino acid 17 of the
protein (L17P). This substitution represents alteration of an amino acid
that has been well conserved from zebrafish to humans.

In 2 Italian patients with keratoconus, 1 sporadic and 1 familial, De
Bonis et al. (2011) detected the L17P allele; the variant was not found
in 200 controls.

605341	TITLE *605341 PAIRED IMMUNOGLOBULIN-LIKE TYPE 2 RECEPTOR, ALPHA; PILRA
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using an SHP1 (176883) mutant as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a
mammary gland cDNA library, followed by 5-prime RACE, Mousseau et al.
(2000) identified a cDNA encoding PILRA (paired immunoglobulin-like
receptor-alpha). Sequence analysis predicted that the 303-amino acid
PILRA protein does not contain an Ig domain per se, but does contain an
Ig-like cysteine-based motif involved in intradomain disulfide bonding.
PILRA also has a potential N-glycosylation site; numerous
O-glycosylation sites; a transmembrane domain; and 3 potential tyrosine
phosphorylation sites, 2 of which are within an immunoreceptor
tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM). When expressed in a kidney cell
line, immunoblot and BIAcore analysis showed that the approximately
50-kD PILRA glycoprotein was tyrosine-phosphorylated and coprecipitated
with SHP1 through a C-terminal tyrosine. Northern blot analysis revealed
strong expression of a 1.4-kb transcript in peripheral blood leukocytes,
with lower signals in lung, spleen, and placenta as well as in 2 B-cell
lines. RT-PCR analysis indicated that PILRA and PILRB (605342) are
expressed, or paired, at the mRNA level in various tissues. Mousseau et
al. (2000) concluded that PILRA and PILRB represent a novel
immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM)-bearing and
non-ITIM-bearing receptor pair.

By random sequencing of an activated monocyte cDNA library, Fournier et
al. (2000) cloned PILRA, which they termed FDF03. RT-PCR analysis
identified 2 splice variants lacking transmembrane domains and
presumably encoding soluble proteins. RT-PCR and flow cytometry analysis
demonstrated expression of PILRA in peripheral blood-derived monocytes,
granulocytes, and particularly dendritic cells, but not in lymphocytes.
Western blot analysis of a monocyte cell line expressing PILRA suggested
that PILRA recruits SHP2 (PTPN11; 176876) more efficiently than it
recruits SHP1, whereas LAIR1 (602992), which is also an inhibitory
molecule, recruits both molecules equivalently. In contrast to LAIR1,
crosslinking of PILRA did not inhibit the differentiation of monocytes
into dendritic cells in the presence of GMCSF (CSF2; 138960).

GENE FUNCTION

Satoh et al. (2008) noted that herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 infection
requires viral glycoprotein B (gB). Using flow cytometric,
immunoprecipitation, and fluorescence microscopy analyses, they showed
that PILRA associated with gB and that cells transduced with PILRA
became susceptible to HSV-1 infection. Infection of cells expressing
both PILRA and HVEM (TNFRSF14; 602746), a receptor for HSV-1 gD, could
be blocked with antibody to either receptor, indicating that cellular
receptors for both gB and gD are required for HSV-1 infection. Satoh et
al. (2008) concluded that PILRA is a coreceptor for HSV-1 infection that
associates with gB.

GENE STRUCTURE

Mousseau et al. (2000) determined that the PILRA gene contains 7 exons
and spans approximately 26.7 kb.

MAPPING

By long-range PCR on genomic DNA and comparison to a chromosome 7
segment (GenBank GENBANK RG161A02), Mousseau et al. (2000) mapped the
PILRA gene to chromosome 7, 5.6 kb downstream from PILRB. Using
radiation hybrid analysis, Fournier et al. (2000) mapped the PILRA gene
to 7q22, a localization distinct from inhibitory receptor gene families
such as LIR (e.g., LILRB1; 604811) on chromosome 19 and the natural
killer cell receptors (e.g., KLRG1; 604874) on chromosome 12. The
localization of PILRA is close, however, to a region associated with
chromosomal abnormalities in the myelodysplastic syndrome and acute
myeloid leukemia.

164873	TITLE *164873 ETS VARIANT GENE 3; ETV3
;;ONCOGENE PE1; PE1;;
MITOGENIC ETS TRANSCRIPTIONAL SUPPRESSOR; METS
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The ETS oncogene (164720) was first described as part of a fusion gene
transduced by the avian retrovirus E26. In E26, v-ets and v-myb (189990)
were fused to a portion of GAG to form the transforming gene. The ETS
oncogene family shares a conserved peptide motif called the ETS domain
that mediates sequence-specific DNA binding. This motif is unique among
transcription factor families. Using partially degenerate
oligonucleotides from conserved regions of the ETS domain and the
polymerase chain reaction, Klemsz et al. (1994) isolated a new member of
the ETS family, designated PE1, from HL60 cells. The PE1 gene was
expressed as an approximately 5-kb transcript in most cell lines tested.

GENE FUNCTION

Klappacher et al. (2002) described a mechanism in which induction of the
ETS repressor METS links terminal differentiation to cell cycle arrest.
Using macrophages as a model, they provided evidence that METS blocks
RAS (190020)-dependent proliferation without inhibiting RAS-dependent
expression of cell type-specific genes by selectively replacing ETS
activators on the promoters of cell cycle control genes. The
antiproliferative effects of METS required its interaction with DP103
(DDX20; 606168), a DEAD box-containing protein that assembles a novel
corepressor complex. Functional interactions between the METS/DP103
complex and E2F (see 189971)/RB1 (614041) family proteins were also
necessary for inhibition of cellular proliferation, suggesting a
combinatorial code that directs permanent cell cycle exit during
terminal differentiation.

MAPPING

Using both in situ hybridization and study of human/hamster cell
hybrids, Klemsz et al. (1994) demonstrated that the PE1 gene is located
on 1q21-q23.

611272	TITLE *611272 ZINC FINGER PROTEIN WITH KRAB AND SCAN DOMAINS 5; ZKSCAN5
;;ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 95; ZFP95;;
KIAA1015
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a brain cDNA library, Nagase et al.
(1999) cloned ZKSCAN5, which they designated KIAA1015. The transcript
contains a repetitive element in its 3-prime UTR, and the deduced
protein contains 839 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA detected low to moderate
expression in all tissues and specific brain regions examined.

By screening a fetal cartilage cDNA library with a degenerate probe
corresponding to the Kruppel zinc finger motif, followed by screening
amniocyte and testis cDNA libraries, Dreyer et al. (1999) obtained a
full-length cDNA encoding ZKSCAN5, which they called ZFP95. The deduced
839-amino acid protein contains an N-terminal SCAN box, followed by a
KRAB A domain and a C-terminal zinc finger domain. Dreyer et al. (1999)
also identified 2 alternatively spliced transcripts, one encoding a
protein lacking the KRAB A domain, and the other encoding a protein
lacking the KRAB A domain and an additional 26 amino acids. Northern
blot analysis detected 4.2- and 4.6-kb transcripts in all tissues
examined, with highest expression in testis. A 3.8-kb transcript was
also detected in adult testis.

Weissig et al. (2003) cloned 3 cDNAS for mouse Zfp95. The longest
deduced protein contains 819 amino acids and has 12 zinc finger domains
in its C-terminal half. Northern blot analysis detected highest Zfp95
expression in testis, with lower levels in brain, heart, kidney, liver,
tongue, lung, and striated muscle. A second transcript was expressed
exclusively in testis. Expression of the testis-specific Zfp95
transcript in isolated germ cells was highest in pachytene
spermatocytes, followed by round spermatids. Mice with the recessive
atrichosis (at) mutation are almost hairless and sterile, with small
gonads that contain few germ cells. Weissig et al. (2003) found
homozygous at mutant mice lacked expression of the testis-specific Zfp95
transcript, whereas the more widely expressed Zfp95 transcript was
expressed in testis, epididymis, seminal vesicle, and prostate. They
concluded that Zfp95 shows differential splicing in meiotic and
postmeiotic germ cells only.

GENE STRUCTURE

Dreyer et al. (1999) determined that the ZKSCAN5 gene contains 7 exons.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1999) mapped the ZKSCAN5
gene to chromosome 7. Using radiation hybrid analysis and FISH, Dreyer
et al. (1999) mapped the ZKSCAN5 gene to chromosome 7q22.

Weissig et al. (2003) mapped the mouse Zkscan5 gene to chromosome 5.

614578	TITLE *614578 PROGESTIN AND ADIPOQ RECEPTOR FAMILY, MEMBER 4; PAQR4
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching databases for sequences encoding a 7-transmembrane domain
similar to those of ADIPOR1 (607945) and ADIPOR2 (607946), Tang et al.
(2005) identified PAQR4. The deduced 272-amino acid protein shares
significant similarity with ADIPOR1 and ADIPOR2 only in the central
7-transmembrane domain. Database analysis revealed a mouse ortholog,
which shares 96% amino acid identity with human PAQR4. RT-PCR analysis
detected high PAQR4 expression in human stomach, lymph node, kidney,
brain, thymus, and bone marrow. Weaker expression was detected in lung,
adrenal gland, colon, skeletal muscle, adipose, testis, bladder,
prostate, small intestine, skin, and heart, with very low expression in
pancreas and liver, and none in breast.

GENE STRUCTURE

Tang et al. (2005) determined that the PAQR4 gene contains 3 coding
exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Tang et al. (2005) mapped the PAQR4 gene
to chromosome 16p13.3.

613903	TITLE *613903 ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 540; ZNF540
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ZNF540 belongs to a large family of transcription factors characterized
by an N-terminal Kruppel-associated box (KRAB) domain and tandem
C-terminal C2H2-type zinc fingers (Qi et al., 2006).

CLONING

Using degenerate primers based on conserved sequences of KRAB
domain-containing zinc finger proteins to screen a 20-week-old embryonic
human heart cDNA library, followed by EST database analysis and 5-prime
and 3-prime RACE, Xiang et al. (2006) cloned ZNF540. The deduced
660-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 77.1 kD. It
has an N-terminal KRAB-A domain, followed by 17 tandem Kruppel C2H2-type
zinc fingers. Northern blot analysis detected variable ZNF540 expression
in all fetal tissues examined. Fluorescence-tagged ZNF540 localized to
both cytoplasm and nuclei of transfected COS-7 cells.

GENE FUNCTION

By cotransfecting COS-7 cells with ZNF540 and a reporter gene system,
Xiang et al. (2006) showed that ZNF540 repressed serum response element
(SRE)- and ELK1 (311040)-mediated transcriptional activation, suggesting
that it functions in the MAP kinase (see 176948) signal transduction
pathway. Deletion analysis identified the KRAB-A domain of ZNF540 as the
main repressive domain. Small interfering RNA directed against ZNF540
reduced the transcriptional repression by ZNF540.

GENE STRUCTURE

Xiang et al. (2006) determined that the ZNF540 gene contains 5 exons and
spans approximately 62.8 kb.

MAPPING

Xiang et al. (2006) mapped the ZNF540 gene to chromosome 19q13.13 by
genomic sequence analysis.

180470	TITLE *180470 RIBOPHORIN I; RPN1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Ribophorins I and II (180490) represent proteins that appear to be
involved in ribosome binding. They are abundant, highly conserved
glycoproteins located exclusively in the membranes of the rough
endoplasmic reticulum.

CLONING

Using probes derived from a human liver expression library, Crimaudo et
al. (1987) isolated and sequenced full-length human cDNA clones encoding
ribophorins I and II. The cDNA clones hybridize to mRNA species of 2.5
kb and encode polypeptides of 68.5 and 69.3 kD, respectively. Sequence
comparisons and immunoblotting with specific antibodies showed both
proteins to be highly conserved throughout a variety of species.
However, no relationship between the 2 proteins could be deduced from
their primary sequences.

GENE FUNCTION

Kelleher et al. (1992) reported that mammalian oligosaccharyltransferase
activity is associated with a protein complex composed of ribophorin I,
ribophorin II, and a 48-kD oligosaccharyltransferase protein (602202).

Rpn1 is a component of the proteasome base. Using in vitro binding
assays with purified yeast proteasomes, Elsasser et al. (2002) found
that the ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain of recombinant Rad23 (see 600061)
interacted with proteasomes through the leucine-rich repeat domain of
Rpn1. Yeast Dsk2 (see 300264) also contains a UBL domain, and it
competed with Rad23 for proteasome binding.

MAPPING

Using cDNA clones, Barton et al. (1987) mapped the RPN1 gene to
chromosome 3 in somatic cell hybrids.

614471	TITLE *614471 UBIQUITIN-SPECIFIC PROTEASE 19; USP19
;;KIAA0891
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

USP19 is a ubiquitin protein ligase (EC 3.4.19.12) with a role in
regulating cell cycle progression (Lu et al., 2009).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) cloned USP19, which they designated
KIAA0891. The deduced 1,371-amino acid protein shares significant
similarity with the ubiquitin protease UNPH (USP4; 603486). RT-PCR ELISA
detected highest expression in fetal liver, followed by adult spinal
cord. All other tissues, including adult and fetal brain, showed much
lower expression, and no expression was detected in spleen.

GENE FUNCTION

p27(KIP1) (CDKN1B; 600778) is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that
regulates the G1/S transition. Using rat myoblast and fibroblast cell
lines, Lu et al. (2009) showed that Usp19 regulated p27(KIP1) levels by
deubiquitinating and stabilizing Kpc1 (RNF123; 614472), an E3 ubiquitin
ligase that ubiquitinates cytosolic p27(KIP1) and targets it for
proteasomal degradation at G1 phase. Immunoprecipitation analysis
revealed that Usp19 interacted directly with Kpc1. Knockdown of Usp19
resulted in loss of Kpc1, accumulation of p27(KIP1), inhibition of cell
proliferation, and slower progression from G0/G1 to S phase.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the USP19 gene
to chromosome 3.

Hartz (2011) mapped the USP19 gene to chromosome 3p21.31 based on an
alignment of the USP19 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AB020698) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Three-prime, 5-prime-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) is the
intracellular second messenger regulating phototransduction in mammals.
The level of cGMP in photoreceptor cells is controlled by the
cGMP-hydrolyzing enzyme cGMP phosphodiesterase and the cGMP-producing
enzyme guanylate cyclase. Two major forms of cyclases are recognized,
the particulate (membrane) and the soluble forms. The membrane guanylate
cyclases are composed of large single subunits consisting of a
ligand-binding N-terminal segment, a transmembrane domain, an internal
protein kinase homology region, and a C-terminal catalytic domain. The
highly homologous membrane guanylate cyclases include NPR1 (natriuretic
peptide receptor A; 108960), NPR2 (natriuretic peptide receptor B;
108961), and NPR3 (natriuretic peptide receptor C; 108962). Shyjan et
al. (1992) cloned a human photoreceptor guanylate cyclase, called retGC
(GUCY2D). The predicted protein sequence is closely related to the other
membrane guanylate cyclases, and all structural domains are well
conserved. However, expressed photoreceptor guanylate cyclase is not
activated by natriuretic peptides.

Yang et al. (1995) cloned 2 guanylyl cyclases, Gucy2e and Gucyf
(300041), from a rat eye cDNA library. These 2 rat genes are expressed
in retina. The mouse and rat Gucy2e genes are homologs of human GUCY2D
(Scott, 2009).

The human GUCY2D protein is 87% identical to its mouse counterpart
(Perrault et al., 1996).

Duda et al. (1999) stated that GUCY2D, which they called rod outer
segment membrane guanylate cyclase (ROS-GC1), was the original member of
the subfamily of membrane guanylate cyclases with 2 Ca(2+) switches
referred to as calcium-regulated modules (CRMs) and designated CRM1 and
CRM2. These are separately located within the intracellular domain of
the cyclase. CRM1 switches on the enzyme at nanomolar concentrations of
calcium ion and is linked with phototransduction; CRM2 stimulates at
micromolar calcium ion concentrations and is predicted to be linked with
retinal synaptic activity.

GENE STRUCTURE

Perrault et al. (1996) determined that the human GUCY2D gene is 16 kb
long and contains 20 exons.

MAPPING

Oliveira et al. (1994) used PCR analysis of human-rodent somatic cell
hybrids to map the GUCY2D locus to chromosome 17. The assignment was
confirmed and regionalized to chromosome 17p13.1 by fluorescence in situ
hybridization.

By interspecific backcross analysis, Yang et al. (1996) mapped the mouse
Gucy2e gene to chromosome 11 in a region of syntenic homology to human
17p13 known to contain loci for autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa
(600059) and Leber congenital amaurosis (204000).

GENE FUNCTION

By coimmunoprecipitation of mouse retinal extracts, Azadi et al. (2010)
found that Rd3 (180040) bound Gc1 and Gc2. They confirmed interaction of
Rd3 with Gc1 in transfected HEK293 cells. A short C-terminal segment of
Gc1 was required for Rd3 binding. When expressed alone in COS-7 cells,
Rd3 colocalized with the endosomal recycling marker Rab11 (see RAB11A;
605570) in a pattern characteristic of intracellular vesicles, whereas
Gc1 localized in a perinuclear distribution characteristic of
endoplasmic reticulum (ER). When coexpressed, Gc1 was exported from the
ER to endosomal vesicles containing Rd3 and Rab11. Retinal extracts from
Rd3 mutant mice lacked Gc1 protein expression and showed reduced Gc2
protein expression compared with wildtype. The GC-activating proteins
Gcap1 (GUCA1A; 600364) and Gcap2 (GUCA1B; 602275) also showed reduced
expression in Rd3 mice, as well as mislocalization to the inner segment
of photoreceptor cells. Azadi et al. (2010) proposed that RD3 may be an
accessory protein required for vesicle trafficking of GCs from inner to
outer segments of rod and cone cells and that it may modulate GC
enzymatic activity.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Leber Congenital Amaurosis 1

By homozygosity mapping in consanguineous families of North African
origin, Camuzat et al. (1995) mapped a gene for Leber congenital
amaurosis (LCA1; 204000) to 17p13.1. Camuzat et al. (1996) provided
evidence of genetic heterogeneity, finding that LCA1 accounted for 8/15
LCA families in their series. Based on 3 key recombinants, Perrault et
al. (1996) were able to reduce the interval encompassing the LCA1 gene
to a critical region of less than 1 cM. Starting from flanking markers,
they ordered 12 YAC clones on 17p13.1. Of the candidate genes expressed
in the retina and located on chromosome 17, none mapped to these YACs
except the gene for retinal guanylate cyclase. Perrault et al. (1996)
found 2 missense mutations (600179.0001; 600179.0004) and 2 frameshift
mutations (600179.0002; 600179.0003) associated with LCA1. As specific
guanylate cyclase activating proteins (GCAPs) are required for retinal
guanylate cyclase activity, the study of Perrault et al. (1996) raised
the question of whether some LCA cases unlinked to 17p13 could be
accounted for by mutations in GCAP genes, which include the GUCA1 gene
(600364) on 6p21.1.

Perrault et al. (2000) screened the whole coding sequence of the RETGC1
gene in 118 patients affected with Leber congenital amaurosis. They
found 22 different mutations in 24 unrelated families originating from
various countries. All RETGC1 mutations consistently caused congenital
cone-rod dystrophy. RETGC1 is an essential protein implicated in the
phototransduction cascade, especially in the recovery of the dark state
after the excitation process of photoreceptor cells by light
stimulation. Perrault et al. (2000) postulated that the RETGC1 mutations
hinder the restoration of the basal level of cGMP of cone and rod
photoreceptor cells, leading to a situation equivalent to consistent
light exposure during photoreceptor development, explaining the severity
of the visual disorder at birth.

- Cone-Rod Dystrophy 6

Leber congenital amaurosis is inherited as an autosomal recessive.
Kelsell et al. (1998) demonstrated that mutations in the GUCY2D gene are
responsible also for a dominant form of cone-rod dystrophy, which they
referred to as CORD6 (601777).

Payne et al. (2001) studied 40 patients: 27 with autosomal dominant
macular dystrophy and 13 with autosomal dominant cone or cone-rod
dystrophy. Two patients were found to carry the R838C mutation
(600179.0006) and 1 the R838H mutation (600179.0008). Combining these
results with those of Kelsell et al. (1998), Payne et al. (2001)
estimated the frequency of mutations at codon 838 of the GUCY2D gene
among patients with autosomal dominant macular cone or cone-rod
dystrophy to be 6.7%. However, if only the 3 mutations in the 13
patients with cone or cone-rod dystrophy are considered, the estimated
frequency of mutations is 23%.

In affected members of a consanguineous Turkish family segregating
autosomal recessive CORD mapping to chromosome 17p13.3, Ugur Iseri et
al. (2010) identified homozygosity for a missense mutation (600179.0010)
in the GUCY2D gene.

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

Wilkie et al. (2000) studied the biochemical effects of various
mutations at codon 838 in RETGC1: the 3 disease-causing substitutions
(R838C, 600179.0006; R838H, 600179.0008 and R838S, 600179.0005) and 4
artificial mutations (R838A, R838E, R838L, and R838K). Assay of
GCAP1-stimulated cyclase activity in vitro showed that, compared with
wildtype, R838E, R838L and R838K had only low activity, whereas R838A,
R838C, R838H, and R838S had activity equal to or greater than wildtype
at low Ca(2+) concentrations as well as a higher apparent affinity for
GCAP1 than did wildtype. The Ca(2+) sensitivity of the GCAP1 activation
was also altered with marked residual activity at high Ca(2+), the
effect increasing in this order: wildtype, R838C, R838H, R838A, R838S.
Within the photoreceptor, this would result in a failure to inactivate
cyclase activity at high physiologic Ca(2+) concentrations. Among the 3
disease-associated mutations, the effect correlated directly with
disease severity. The wildtype and R838H mutant displayed a difference
in pH sensitivity, with the mutant showing a higher specific activity
with pH greater than 6.0. Site 838 is in the dimerization domain that
forms a coiled-coil in the active protein. A computer-aided structure
prediction of this region indicated that R838 in the wildtype breaks the
structure at 4 helical turns, and there is an increasing tendency for
the structure to continue for further turns in the order R838C;
R838H,S,K; R838E; R838A; R838L.

Downes et al. (2001) described the phenotype and electrophysiologic
responses in 4 British families, 3 with an R838C mutation and 1 with an
R838H mutation in the GUCY2D gene. Although subjects had lifelong poor
vision in bright light, a major reduction in visual acuity did not occur
in most of them until after their late teens. Fundus abnormalities were
confined to the central macula, and increasing central atrophy was noted
with age. Electrophysiologic testing revealed a marked loss of cone
function with only minimal rod involvement, even in older subjects. The
authors concluded that the phenotype associated with autosomal dominant
cone-rod dystrophy with either an R838C or R838H mutation in GUCY2D was
distinctive, with predominantly cone system involvement. There was some
variation in severity within the 3 families with the R838C mutation.
Families with the R838C or R838H mutations had a much milder phenotype
than the families previously described with the E837D/R838S mutation
(600179.0005) in GUCY2D.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
LEBER CONGENITAL AMAUROSIS 1
GUCY2D, PHE565SER

In all sibs with Leber congenital amaurosis (204000) in 2 consanguineous
Arab-Algerian families, Perrault et al. (1996) found homozygosity for a
T-to-C transition in exon 8 at nucleotide 1767 of the GUC2D gene. The
nucleotide change converted phenylalanine to serine in the protein. The
substitution of an aromatic nonpolar amino acid by an uncharged polar
amino acid within the kinase-like domain markedly altered the
hydrophobicity of the protein and was expected to affect its stability
severely. Perrault et al. (1996) reported the predicted change at amino
acid 589 (F589S), but Duda et al. (1999) stated that the correct
position is 565.

Duda et al. (1999) showed that the bovine F514S mutation, which
corresponds to the human F565S mutation, severely damages the intrinsic
cyclase activity of ROS-GC1 and inactivates its CRM1 switch but does not
affect the CRM2 switch. In addition, on the basis of the established
modulatory features of ROS-GC1, Duda et al. (1999) predicted that in 2
other forms of Leber congenital amaurosis involving deletion of
nucleotide 460C (600179.0002) or 693C (600179.0003), there is a
frameshift in the GUCY2D gene that results in nonexpression of the
cyclase.

LEBER CONGENITAL AMAUROSIS 1
GUCY2D, 1-BP DEL, 460C

In a Jewish Sephardi family of Tunisian origin, Perrault et al. (1996)
found that members with Leber congenital amaurosis (204000) were
homozygous for a 1-bp deletion (460delC) in exon 2 at nucleotide 460 of
GUC2D that modified the downstream amino acid sequence, abolished a SmaI
restriction site, and resulted in a premature translation termination at
codon 165.

LEBER CONGENITAL AMAUROSIS 1
GUCY2D, 1-BP DEL, 693C

In members of an Arab family of Tunisian origin affected with Leber
congenital amaurosis (204000), Perrault et al. (1996) observed a
homozygous 1-bp deletion in exon 2 at nucleotide 693 (693delC) of GUC2D
that modified the downstream amino acid sequence, created a BspMI
restriction site, and resulted in a premature translation termination at
codon 215.

LEBER CONGENITAL AMAUROSIS 1
GUCY2D, ALA52SER

In all sibs with Leber congenital amaurosis (204000) in a consanguineous
Arab Tunisian family, Perrault et al. (1996) found homozygosity for a
G-to-T transversion at nucleotide 227 of GUC2D converting an alanine
into a serine (A52S). Heterozygosity for the same mutation was detected
in affected members of a family of Basque ancestry. As the same base
change was detected in 2 of 100 controls, it was difficult to decide
whether this was a disease-causing mutation or a rare polymorphism.

.0005
CONE-ROD DYSTROPHY 6
GUCY2D, GLU837ASP AND ARG838SER

In a 4-generation British family with cone-rod dystrophy (CORD6;
601777), Kelsell et al. (1997) showed linkage between the disorder and
17p13-p12. Cone-rod dystrophy in this family displayed an early onset,
with loss of central vision reported before 7 years of age and
peripheral field loss by the fourth decade. A notable feature was marked
photophobia, particularly when dark-adapted. Funduscopy showed a 'bull's
eye' maculopathy early in the disease, with later involvement of the
peripheral retina. Electroretinography showed no detectable cone
responses early in the disease, with progressive abnormality of rod
responses appearing later. Kelsell et al. (1998) studied the GUC2D gene
because it maps to the same chromosomal area. Direct sequence analysis
of all 18 coding exons of the gene demonstrated a heterozygous
alteration in exon 13: 2584G-C, predicted to cause a glu837-to-asp
(E837D) amino acid substitution.

Gregory-Evans et al. (2000) stated that further analysis of the family
originally studied by Kelsell et al. (1997) led to a reappraisal of the
mutation, redefined as glu837 to asp/arg838 to ser. They described the
clinical features in this family (see 601777).

.0006
CONE-ROD DYSTROPHY 6
GUCY2D, ARG838CYS

Kelsell et al. (1998) found another heterozygous mutation of the GUC2D
gene in a family with cone-rod dystrophy (CORD6; 601777) with features
somewhat different from that of the original CORD6 family described in
600179.0005. In 3 families carrying this second mutation (arg838 to cys;
R838C), affected individuals, although aware of poor vision in bright
light from an early age, suffered loss of central vision in the late
second or third decade, later than was found in the original family with
the E837D mutation. The fundus appearance of affected members of these 3
families was, however, very similar to that of the original family.
Electrophysiologic testing revealed marked loss of photopic function by
the mid-teens, with scotopic function becoming compromised later.
Genealogic studies failed to show a relationship between the 3 families.
The R838C amino acid substitution resulted from a C-to-T transition at
nucleotide 2585. Alignment of the portion of membrane-bound guanylate
cyclases in this domain, represented by codons 809 to 871, showed that
both glu837 and arg838 are fully conserved.

In 38 affected members of a large multigenerational family from eastern
Tennessee with autosomal dominant progressive cone dystrophy, originally
described by Small and Gehrs (1996), Udar et al. (2003) identified the
R838C mutation in the GUCY2D gene. The mutation was also detected in 2
unaffected family members, but was not found in 22 additional unaffected
family members or 200 control chromosomes.

.0007
CONE-ROD DYSTROPHY 6
GUCY2D, GLU837ASP, ARG838CYS, AND THR839MET

Perrault et al. (1998) found a mutation in the GUC2D gene in a family
with autosomal dominant cone-rod dystrophy (CORD6; 601777). Six members
of 3 generations were affected with an early cone dysfunction
characterized by decreased vision acuity, with severe color
dyschromatopsia and photophobia, during the first decade of life. At
that stage, ophthalmoscopic examinations were not specific. By contrast,
electrophysiologic testing revealed marked loss of photopic function,
with scotopic function relatively well preserved, and the visual field
showed a consistent central scotoma. During the second and third
decades, visual acuity decreased dramatically, and the color vision
defect was confined to achromatopsia, hampering normal schooling and
professional initiation. After the age of 40 years, peripheral visual
field loss and progressive night blindness were observed, and the ERG
became unrecordable. A maximum lod score of 2.71 at recombination
fraction zero was found for 2 markers in the region of the GUC2D gene.
Affected members of the family were found to be heterozygous for a
complex mutational event involving 3 consecutive missense mutations in
exon 13: (1) a G-to-C transversion at nucleotide 2584, changing a
glutamate to an aspartate at codon 837 (E837D); (2) a C-to-T transition
at nucleotide 2585, changing an arginine to a cysteine at codon 838
(R838C); and (3) a C-to-T transition at nucleotide 2589, changing a
threonine to a methionine at codon 839 (T839M). This triple mutation has
the earmarks of a gene conversion event.

.0008
CONE-ROD DYSTROPHY 6
GUCY2D, ARG838HIS

In a patient with cone-rod dystrophy-6 (CORD6; 601777), Weigell-Weber et
al. (2000) detected a G-to-A transition of the GCGC stretch at position
2586 in exon 13 of the GUCY2D gene, resulting in a conservative
arg838-to-his (R838H) substitution.

In 8 affected members of a Caucasian American family with cone
dystrophy, Udar et al. (2003) identified the R838H mutation in the
GUCY2D gene. The mutation was not found in 5 unaffected family members
or 200 control chromosomes.

.0009
LEBER CONGENITAL AMAUROSIS 1
GUCY2D, 1-BP DEL, 2943G

Hanein et al. (2002) identified a homozygous 2943G deletion (2943delG)
in the GUCY2D gene in 3 unrelated and nonconsanguineous Leber congenital
amaurosis (204000) families of Finnish origin, suggesting a founder
effect. No linkage disequilibrium was found using polymorphic markers
flanking the GUCY2D gene, supporting the view that the mutation is very
ancient. Haplotype studies and Bayesian calculation pointed the founder
mutation to 150 generations (i.e., 3,000 years ago).

.0010
CONE-ROD DYSTROPHY 6
GUCY2D, ILE949THR

In 6 affected members of a consanguineous Turkish family segregating
autosomal recessive cone-rod dystrophy-6 (CORD6; 601777), Ugur Iseri et
al. (2010) identified homozygosity for a 2846T-C transition in exon 15
of the GUCY2D gene, resulting in an ile949-to-thr (I949T) substitution
at a highly conserved residue in the catalytic domain. The mutation was
not detected in 186 control chromosomes. Ugur Iseri et al. (2010)
predicted that substitution of hydrophobic isoleucine with polar
threonine in this region would interfere with proper folding of the
helical segment and affect function of the catalytic domain, and they
proposed that the I949T mutation does not abolish but only decreases
enzymatic activity.

HETEROGENEOUS NUCLEAR RIBONUCLEOPROTEIN M4; HNRNPM4;;
HNRPM4;;
N-ACETYLGLUCOSAMINE RECEPTOR 1, FORMERLY; NAGR1, FORMERLY
DESCRIPTION Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs), which directly bind
to nascent RNA polymerase II transcripts, play an important role in both
transcript-specific packaging and alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs.
Datar et al. (1993) isolated and characterized a group of hnRNPs, the M1
to M4 proteins. The M proteins are pre-mRNA-binding proteins in vivo,
and they bind avidly to poly(G) and poly(U) RNA homopolymers in vitro.
Datar et al. (1993) cloned HNRPM4, which encodes the largest M protein,
M4, with 729 amino acids and a molecular mass of about 77 kD. The M4
protein contains 3 ribonucleoprotein consensus sequence RNA-binding
domains of approximately 90 amino acids each, a glycine- and
methionine-rich region, and an MR (methionine/arginine) repeat motif. It
also contains 9 potential casein kinase type II phosphorylation sites
and a tyrosine phosphorylation site. Two-dimensional gels showed
multiple M4 isoforms, which may be the result of phosphorylation.
Database searches indicated that M4 is most highly related to a
hypothetical 49-kD RNA-binding protein of S. cerevisiae.

Blanck et al. (1994) cloned a cDNA encoding what they believed to be a
monomer for the human GlcNAc thyroid receptor. They assigned the gene,
which they called NAGR1, to 19p13.3-p13.2 by isotopic in situ
hybridization. Northern blot analysis detected a 2.1-kb NAGR1 transcript
in thyroid but not in heart, brain, placenta, lung, liver, skeletal
muscle, kidney, or pancreas. In an erratum, the authors stated that
their original sequence was in error and that the corrected sequence 'is
almost identical to that of the cDNA encoding the human hnRNP M protein'
cloned by Datar et al. (1993). NAGR1, therefore, could no longer be
considered a putative GlcNAc-specific thyroid receptor.

611534	TITLE *611534 NUCLEOLAR PROTEIN 8; NOL8
;;NOP132
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

NOL8 is a nucleolar protein that functions in ribosome biogenesis
(Sekiguchi et al., 2006).

CLONING

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis using RRAGA (612194) as bait, followed by
database analysis and RT-PCR of HeLa RNA, Sekiguchi et al. (2004) cloned
NOL8, which they called NOP132. The deduced 1,168-amino acid protein has
a calculated molecular mass of 132 kD and shares 83.8% and 70.7% amino
acid identity with its mouse ortholog over the N-terminal and C-terminal
regions, respectively. NOL8 contains a C-terminal nuclear localization
signal and 3 predicted coiled-coil structures. Immunofluorescence and
immunocytochemical studies localized NOL8 to the nucleolus.

Using cDNA microarray analysis of 20 diffuse-type gastric cancers,
Jinawath et al. (2004) identified NOL8 as a gene upregulated
specifically in gastric cancer tissues compared to noncancerous mucosa.
NOL8 has an N-terminal RNA recognition motif (RRM) domain and a
C-terminal KOG4365 domain. Northern blot analysis detected a 4.4-kb
transcript in skeletal muscle with little-to-no expression in 22 other
tissues examined. Semiquantitative RT-PCR detected NOL8 expression in 7
gastric cancer cell lines; all cell lines showed higher NOL8 expression
than normal skeletal muscle. Immunoblot analysis with lambda-protein
phosphatase demonstrated that NOL8 is phosphorylated.

GENE FUNCTION

Sekiguchi et al. (2004) showed that NOL8 expressed in Sf9 insect cells
coimmunoprecipitated with RRAGA, RRAGC (608267), and RRAGD (608268). By
yeast 2-hybrid analysis with RRAGA mutants, they found that NOL8 bound
specifically to GTP-bound RRAGA but not to GDP-bound RRAGA. Yeast
2-hybrid analysis and GST pull-down assays demonstrated that NOL8
interacted with NIP7. In baby hamster fibroblasts, NOL8 colocalized in
the nucleus with RRAGA and NIP7, respectively. Deletion analysis and
additional interaction assays showed that the NOL8 C-terminal amino
acids 966-1116 mediated interaction with NIP7, RRAGA, and RRAGC.
Antisense oligonucleotide inhibition of NOL8 caused dose-dependent
growth suppression in HeLa cells that was accompanied by reduced DNA
synthesis.

Jinawath et al. (2004) showed that siRNA knockdown of NOL8 suppressed
growth in gastric cancer cells. FACS analysis of the NOL8-knockdown
cells showed an increase in the sub-G1 population. Jinawath et al.
(2004) concluded that suppression of NOL8 expression induced apoptosis.

Sekiguchi et al. (2006) characterized proteins that immunoprecipitated
with epitope-tagged NOP132 from human 293EBNA cells. Mass spectrometric
and database analyses revealed many proteins from the large and small
ribosomal subunits, as well as proteins previously characterized in
human pre-ribosomal nucleoprotein complexes. The putative RNA helicases
DDX18 (606355) and DDX47 (615428) were also detected in NOP132
immunoprecipitates. A similar complement of proteins immunoprecipitated
with DDX18 or DDX47. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments confirmed
association of NOP132 with DDX18 and DDX47, but not with other DDX
proteins. RNase treatment significantly decreased association of NOP132
with DDX18 and DDX47, suggesting that their interaction depends on RNA.
Similarly, RNase treatment released most of the NOP132-, DDX18-, and
DDX47-associated proteins. NOP132, DDX18, and DDX47 colocalized with the
nucleolar protein KIAA0559 (NAP1; 608865) in HeLa cells, and knockdown
of NOP132 by small interfering RNA caused mislocalization of DDX47 to
the nucleolar periphery. Mutation analysis revealed that the coiled-coil
region of NOP132 interacted with the HELICc motif of DDX47. Sekiguchi et
al. (2006) concluded that NOP132 is required for proper targeting of
DDX47 to the nucleolar organizing region during ribosome biogenesis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Jinawath et al. (2004) determined that the NOL8 gene contains 16 exons
spanning 30 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Jinawath et al. (2004) mapped the NOL8
gene to chromosome 9q22.32.

SECRETED LY6/UPAR-RELATED PROTEIN 2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The LYNX1 gene encodes a protein that shares characteristics with toxins
that bind and inhibit nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR; see,
e.g., CHRNA1, 100690) (Miwa et al., 1999). Components of snake venoms
often have structural and functional mammalian homologs. For example,
hemolytic snake venom toxins are related to cellular phospholipases
(e.g., PLA2G1B; 172410), and snake sarafotoxins may be related to
vertebrate endothelins (e.g., EDN1; 131240). The elapid venom
alpha-bungarotoxin also binds to and inhibits nAChR.

CLONING

By screening for central nervous system-specific, developmentally
regulated cDNAs in mouse, Miwa et al. (1999) identified a cDNA encoding
GC26, which was expressed in mouse cerebellum. Sequence analysis
predicted that the 116-amino acid protein contains a signal sequence at
its N terminus, a cysteine-rich consensus motif characteristic of LY6
family proteins (e.g., CD59; 107271) and snake alpha-neurotoxins, and an
asparagine/GPI anchor motif at its C terminus. The overall structure of
GC26 is similar to that of LY6 family proteins and snake
alpha-neurotoxins, and Miwa et al. (1999) redesignated the protein
'Ly6/neurotoxin-1,' or Lynx1. A partial sequence encoding a human Lynx1
homolog has been identified (GenBank GENBANK AF321824). Northern blot
analysis revealed predominant expression of Lynx1 in mouse brain. In
situ hybridization analysis showed Lynx1 expression in neurons in
multiple brain structures. Immunocytochemistry demonstrated expression
of Lynx1 in neuronal soma and proximal dendrites.

Using microarray analysis to identify ESTs expressed predominantly in
the skin of patients with psoriasis vulgaris (see 177900), followed by
PCR and RACE of cultured keratinocyte cDNA libraries, Tsuji et al.
(2003) cloned LYNX1, which they called SLURP2. The deduced 97-amino acid
protein contains a signal peptide and 10 conserved cysteine residues
with a spacing pattern characteristic of the LY6 superfamily, but it
does not have the GPI anchor or transmembrane domains found in
membrane-bound LY6 proteins. Northern blot analysis detected a 0.6-kb
transcript in esophagus and a 1.6-kb transcript in stomach and duodenum.
No expression was detected in other tissues examined, including skin.
RT-PCR detected abundant LYNX1 expression in cervix and esophagus, with
lower expression in adult and fetal skin and keratinocytes. Weak
expression was detected in brain, lung, stomach, small intestine, colon,
rectum, uterus, and thymus. No expression was detected in spleen and
bone marrow. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis detected a 3.8- to
2.8-fold increase in LYNX1 expression in lesional skin from 5 psoriasis
patients compared with nonlesional skin or normal skin.

GENE FUNCTION

Functional analysis by Miwa et al. (1999) indicated that Lynx1 is not a
ligand or neurotransmitter but has the capacity to enhance nicotinic
acetylcholine receptor function in the presence of acetylcholine.

Morishita et al. (2010) identified an increase in expression of Lynx1
protein in mice that prevented plasticity in the primary visual cortex
late in life. Removal of this molecular brake enhanced nicotinic
acetylcholine receptor signaling. Lynx1 expression thus maintains
stability of mature cortical networks in the presence of cholinergic
innervation. Morishita et al. (2010) concluded that modulating the
balance between excitatory and inhibitory circuits reactivates visual
plasticity.

GENE STRUCTURE

Tsuji et al. (2003) determined that the LYNX1 gene contains 3 exons and
spans about 5.6 kb. The promoter region contains 3 Sp1 (189906)- and 2
AP1 (165160)-binding sites, as well as single sites for E2F (189971) and
GATA3 (131320). It lacks TATA and CAAT consensus sequences. There are 2
major transcriptional initiation sites.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Tsuji et al. (2003) mapped the LYNX1 gene
to chromosome 8q24.3. Southern blot analysis indicated that LYNX1 is a
single-copy gene.

EVOLUTION

Human evolution is characterized by a dramatic increase in brain size
and complexity. To probe its genetic basis, Dorus et al. (2004) examined
the evolution of genes involved in diverse aspects of nervous system
biology. These genes, including LYNX1, displayed significantly higher
rates of protein evolution in primates than in rodents. This trend was
most pronounced for the subset of genes implicated in nervous system
development. Moreover, within primates, the acceleration of protein
evolution was most prominent in the lineage leading from ancestral
primates to humans. Dorus et al. (2004) concluded that the phenotypic
evolution of the human nervous system has a salient molecular correlate,
i.e., accelerated evolution of the underlying genes, particularly those
linked to nervous system development.

ANIMAL MODEL

Miwa et al. (2006) found that Lynx1 -/- mice showed no gross
abnormalities in size, viability, CNS morphology, or longevity compared
to wildtype mice. However, Lynx1-null mice showed increased learning and
memory in a fear-conditioned paradigm and displayed increased
sensitivity to nicotine in motor tasks compared to wildtype. Neurons
from Lynx1-null mice showed heightened sensitivity and increased
intracellular calcium levels in response to nicotine. Loss of Lynx1
decreased receptor desensitization and enhanced synaptic efficacy.
Mutant neurons were also more sensitive to excitotoxic insult, and Lynx1
mutant mice exhibited age-dependent degeneration that was exacerbated by
nicotine and rescued by null mutations in nAChR subunits. These data
supported the hypotheses that Lynx1 normally decreases activity of
nAChRs and that deletion of Lynx1 shifts the balance in favor of
increased neuronal activity and synaptic plasticity. But the short-term
benefits of the loss of Lynx1 were counterbalanced by an increased
vulnerability of Lynx1 mutant neurons to glutamate toxicity and by loss
of nicotine's neuroprotective effect on these cells. Miwa et al. (2006)
concluded that Lynx1 modulates nAChR function to maintain low
sensitivity and plays a critical role in maintaining a balance between
the beneficial effects of short-term nAChR activation and the
degenerative effects of chronic receptor activation.

610355	TITLE *610355 PARTNER AND LOCALIZER OF BRCA2; PALB2
;;FANCN GENE; FANCN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

PALB2 colocalizes with BRCA2 (600185) in nuclear foci, promotes its
localization and stability in nuclear structures, and enables its
recombinational repair and checkpoint functions (Xia et al., 2006).

CLONING

Using mass spectrometric analysis to identify proteins that
immunoprecipitated with BRCA2 from HeLa cell extracts, followed by
RT-PCR, Xia et al. (2006) cloned PALB2. The deduced 1,186-amino acid
protein has a calculated molecular mass of about 130 kD. PALB2 contains
an N-terminal prefoldin (see 604897)-like domain and 2 C-terminal
WD40-like repeats. Immunohistochemical staining of a human osteosarcoma
cell line localized PALB2 with BRCA2 in S-phase foci.

GENE FUNCTION

By coimmunoprecipitation analysis, Xia et al. (2006) found that PALB2
and BRCA2 coimmunoprecipitated from lysates of several human cell lines.
Differential extraction showed that BRCA2 and PALB2 were associated with
stable nuclear structures and were likely complexed in chromatin.
Immunodepletion of BRCA2 codepleted much of PALB2, whereas
immunodepletion of PALB2 codepleted nearly all BRCA2. BRCA1 (113705)
abundance was not significantly affected. S-phase foci containing BRCA2
and PALB2 underwent dispersal and refocusing after ionizing radiation,
suggesting that, like BRCA2, PALB2 participates in DNA damage response.
Depletion of PALB2 by small interfering RNA largely abrogated BRCA2
focus formation. No BRCA2 foci were observed even after ionizing
radiation in PALB2-depleted cells. PALB2 appeared to promote stable
association of BRCA2 with nuclear structures, allowing BRCA2 to escape
the effects of proteasome-mediated degradation. Multiple germline BRCA2
missense mutations identified in breast cancer patients appeared to
disrupt PALB2 binding and disable the homologous recombination-based DNA
double-strand break repair function of BRCA2.

GENE STRUCTURE

Xia et al. (2007) and Reid et al. (2007) determined that the PALB2 gene
comprises 13 exons.

MAPPING

Xia et al. (2006) stated that the PALB2 gene maps to chromosome 16p12.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Fanconi Anemia, Complementation Group N

Xia et al. (2007) identified a patient who appeared to represent a
theretofore unrecognized Fanconi anemia complementation group,
designated subtype N (FANCN; 610832). This individual showed normal
monoubiquitination of FANCD2 (227646) and no detected pathogenic
alterations in BRCA2 (600185) or FANCJ (609054). Lack of full-length
PALB2 protein and the reduced amount of BRCA2 suggested the existence of
sequence alterations in the gene encoding PALB2, since PALB2 interacts
with BRCA2 and is important in determining the localization and
stability of BRCA2 in the nucleus. In a phenotypically reverted
(mitomycin C-resistant) subline of patient lymphoblasts, a normal amount
of BRCA2 without the reappearance of PALB2 was found. Xia et al. (2007)
sequenced the genomic DNA as well as cDNA from this patient and found an
apparently homozygous or hemizygous nonsense mutation in exon 4, leading
to the amino acid change Y551X (610355.0001). As this mutation was
detected only in the mother, Xia et al. (2007) suspected that the
patient was a compound heterozygote for a deletion on the paternal
allele in the region of the exon 4 mutation. Multiplex
ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) analysis confirmed an
intragenic deletion present on the paternal allele (610355.0002). cDNA
sequencing and MLPA analysis uncovered a second sequence alteration in
revertant cells that restored part of the PALB2 open reading frame (ORF)
that could explain recovery of PALB2 activity. The corrective alteration
deleted the premature stop-containing exon 4 from the mRNA, resulting in
an in-frame fusion of exons 3 and 5. Subsequent genomic sequencing
showed a 5,962-bp deletion between Alu repeats in introns 3 and 4 of the
maternal allele that was probably generated by a spontaneous
Alu-mediated recombination. Further studies showed that a shortened
PALB2 protein with a large internal deletion was functional, whereas the
N-terminal 550 residues of PALB2 could not function alone.

Reid et al. (2007) demonstrated pathogenic mutations in PALB2 in 7
families with Fanconi anemia and cancer in early childhood,
demonstrating that biallelic PALB2 mutations cause a novel subtype of
Fanconi anemia, FA-N, and, similar to biallelic BRCA2 mutations, confer
a high risk of childhood cancer.

- Adult Cancer Susceptibility

As PALB2 is critical for the function of BRCA2 in DNA repair and tumor
suppression, it could, in principle, also be a tumor suppressor protein.
Xia et al. (2007) noted that several family members of the individual
they studied with FANCN indeed developed tumors, and some of these
tumors fell into the BRCA2 tumor spectrum: cancers of the esophagus,
breast, prostate, and stomach. Reid et al. (2007) suggested that, given
the intimate functional links between PALB2 and BRCA2 and the similar
phenotypes associated with biallelic mutations in the genes that encode
them, it seemed plausible that monoallelic PALB2 mutations could confer
susceptibility to adult cancer.

- Breast Cancer Susceptibility

To investigate whether monoallelic PALB2 mutations confer susceptibility
to breast cancer (114480), Rahman et al. (2007) sequenced the PALB2 gene
in individuals with breast cancer from familial breast cancer pedigrees
in which mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 had not been found, and in 1,084
controls. They identified monoallelic truncating PALB2 mutations in 10
of 923 individuals with familial breast cancer and in none of the
controls (P = 0.0004), and showed that such mutations confer a 2.3-fold
higher risk of breast cancer. The results established PALB2 as a breast
cancer susceptibility gene and further demonstrated the close
relationship of the Fanconi anemia-DNA repair pathway and breast cancer
predisposition.

Erkko et al. (2007) screened for PALB2 mutations in Finland and found
that a frameshift mutation, 1592delT (see 610355.0006), is present at
significantly elevated frequency in familial breast cancer cases
compared with ancestry-matched population controls. The truncated PALB2
protein caused by this mutation retained little BRCA2-binding capacity
and was deficient in homologous recombination and crosslink repair.
Further screening of c.1592delT in unselected breast cancer individuals
revealed a roughly 4-fold enrichment of this mutation in patients
compared with controls. Most of the mutation-positive unselected cases
had a familial pattern of disease development. In addition, 1
multigenerational prostate cancer family that segregated the 1592delT
truncation allele was observed. Erkko et al. (2007) concluded that these
results indicated that PALB2 is a breast cancer susceptibility gene
that, in a suitably mutant form, may also contribute to familial
prostate cancer development.

By screening the PALB2 gene, Tischkowitz et al. (2012) identified 5
pathogenic truncating mutations in 0.9% of 559 patients with
contralateral breast cancer compared to no PALB2 mutations among 565
women with unilateral breast cancer, who were used as controls (p =
0.04). Among the mutation carriers, the median ages of the first and
second breast cancers were 46 and 55 years, respectively, and all
probands had at least 1 first-degree relative with breast cancer,
yielding a relative risk of 5.3 for carriers of a pathogenic PALB2
mutation. The frequency of rare missense mutations was similar in both
groups, suggesting that rare PALB2 missense mutations do not strongly
influence breast cancer risk.

- Pancreatic Cancer Susceptibility

In a patient with pancreatic cancer (PNCA3; 613348) whose tumor DNA had
previously been sequenced, Jones et al. (2009) found 15,461 germline
variants among 20,661 coding genes screened. Three genes, including
PALB2, carried variants in both germline and tumor DNA. PALB2 was
considered the best candidate because of the rarity of terminating PALB2
mutations in healthy individuals and because PALB2 had previously been
implicated in breast cancer and Fanconi anemia. This patient harbored a
germline deletion of 4 basepairs that resulted in a frameshift
(610355.0007). Jones et al. (2009) identified truncating mutations in 3
of a cohort of 96 patients with familial pancreatic cancer. Although
some families that Jones et al. (2009) identified with a PALB2 stop
mutation had a history of both breast and pancreatic cancer, breast
cancer was not observed in all families. Jones et al. (2009) concluded
that PALB2 appears to be the second most commonly mutated gene for
hereditary pancreatic cancer. The most commonly mutated gene is BRCA2,
whose protein product is a binding partner for the PALB2 protein.

ANIMAL MODEL

Rantakari et al. (2010) found that Palb2 +/- mice were normal in
appearance and fertile; they lacked macroscopic tumors from birth
through final follow-up at age 8 months. Homozygous Palb2 -/- mouse
embryos died prior to embryonic day 9.5. The mutant embryos were small
and developmentally retarded and displayed defective mesoderm
differentiation after gastrulation. In Palb2 -/- embryos, the expression
of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 (CDKN1A; 116899) was increased,
and Palb2 -/- blastocysts showed a growth defect in vitro. Hence, the
phenotype observed in the early development of Palb2 -/- mouse embryos
resembled those in Brca1 (113705) and Brca2 (600185) knockout mice. The
authors concluded that the PALB2 gene plays an important role in early
mouse embryogenesis, and that the protein is essential for cell
proliferation, acting in the same cellular processes as BRCA1 and BRCA2.

In an infant with Fanconi anemia of complementation group N (FANCN;
610832), Xia et al. (2007) found compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations
in the PALB2 gene: an 1802T-A transversion in exon 4 that resulted in
premature termination of the protein (Y551X) on the maternal allele, and
an intragenic deletion inherited from the father (610355.0002).

In 2 separate families, 1 British and the other North American, Reid et
al. (2007) found that Fanconi anemia of complementation group N (FANCN;
610832) was associated with a 3549C-G transversion in exon 13 of the
PALB2 gene. The transversion resulted in substitution of a termination
codon for tyrosine at codon 1183 (Y1183X). In the British family, the
Y1183X mutation was present in compound heterozygous state with a Q988X
mutation (610355.0004); in the North American family, with a frameshift
mutation (610355.0005).

Rahman et al. (2007) found the 3549C-G mutation in heterozygous state in
3 unrelated women with breast cancer (114480), all from families with
multiple cases of breast cancer. One of the woman also had melanoma.

PALB2 gene, resulting in premature termination of the protein (Q988X),
in compound heterozygosity with a second premature termination mutation
(610355.0003).

(N1039fs), in exon 11 of the PALB2 gene in compound heterozygosity with
a premature termination mutation (610355.0003).

In 3 individuals with breast cancer (114480) from separate unrelated

Erkko et al. (2007) screened probands from 113 BRCA1/BRCA2
mutation-negative breast or breast-ovarian cancer (114480) families from
northern Finland. A 1-bp deletion of thymidine at nucleotide 1592 of the
PALB2 coding sequence was detected in 3 probands but only in 6 of 2,501
controls, giving an odds ratio of 11.3 and a 95% confidence interval of
1.8 to 57.8. The alteration should result in frameshift at leu531, with
the new open reading frame progressing for 28 codons before termination.
The mutation was also found in 18 of 1,918 Finnish unselected breast
cancer cases (odds ratio of 3.94, 95% CI 1.5-12.1).

germline deletion of 4 basepairs in the PALB2 gene, TTGT approximately
at nucleotide 172 in exon 3, that produced a frameshift at codon 58. The
pancreatic cancer had also somatically acquired a transition mutation, a

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using primers based on the conserved region of mitochondrial Ak3 cDNA
from bovine, rat, and mouse, followed by 5-prime and 3-prime RACE, Noma
et al. (2001) cloned human AK3 from a liver cDNA library. The deduced
227-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 25.6 kD. AK3
shares 57.4% amino acid identity with AK4 (AK3L1; 103030). It shares
75%, 90%, and 91% amino acid identity with bovine, rat, and mouse Ak3,
respectively. Northern blot analysis detected a 3.2-kb transcript in all
tissues examined. Expression was highest in heart, liver, and skeletal
muscle, moderate in kidney and pancreas, and weak in brain, placenta,
and lung. Transcripts of 5, 1.8, and 1.35 kb were detected in heart,
liver, and pancreas. Western blot analysis detected AK3 at an apparent
molecular mass of 28 kD in all tissues examined. Subcellular
fractionation of mouse liver and kidney detected Ak3 in the
mitochondrial fraction.

GENE FUNCTION

Noma et al. (2001) assayed recombinant AK3 expressed in E. coli and
showed that the enzyme had GTP:ATP phosphotransferase activity. Human
embryonic kidney cells had endogenous phosphotransferase activity, which
increased following transfection of AK3 cDNA.

MAPPING

By study of somatic cell hybrids, Povey et al. (1976) assigned the AK3
gene to chromosome 9. The smallest region of overlap for AK3 was
estimated to be 9p24-p13 (Robson and Meera Khan, 1982).

By interspecific backcross linkage analysis, Pilz et al. (1995) mapped
the Ak3 gene to mouse chromosome 4.
