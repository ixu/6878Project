;;ACYL-CoA SYNTHETASE 1; ACECS1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Fatty acids are incorporated into membranes and signaling molecules and
have roles in energy storage and metabolism. These essential functions
require activation of the fatty acid by acyl-coenzyme A (CoA)
synthetases, such as ACSS1, which form an activating thioester linkage
between the fatty acid and CoA (Watkins et al., 2007).

CLONING

Fujino et al. (2001) cloned mouse Acss1 and Acss2 (605832), which they
called Acecs1 and Acecs2, respectively. The deduced 701-amino acid Acss1
protein shares 45.8% identity with Acss2. Northern blot analysis
detected high expression of a 3.6-kb Acss1 transcript in liver, kidney,
and testis. Lower expression was detected in heart, brain, spleen, lung,
and skeletal muscle. Fractionation of mouse kidney revealed cytosolic
localization for Acss1 and mitochondrial localization for Acss2.

By database analysis, Watkins et al. (2007) identified human ACSS1. The
deduced 689-amino acid protein contains 4 of 5 motifs characteristic of
acyl-CoA synthetases. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that ACSS1 belongs
to a short chain clade of acyl-CoA synthetases.

GENE FUNCTION

By assaying proteins purified from transfected COS-7 cells, Fujino et
al. (2001) showed that both mouse Acss1 and Acss2 preferred acetate as
substrate for the synthesis of acetyl-CoA. Little to no activity was
detected with other short or medium chain fatty acids. Acss1 expression,
but not Acss2 expression, was induced by differentiation of mouse 3T3-L1
cells. In contrast, Acss2 expression, but not Acss1 expression, was
induced by fasting in mice and by diabetes in Zucker rats.

GENE STRUCTURE

Watkins et al. (2007) determined that the ACSS1 gene contains 14 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Watkins et al. (2007) mapped the ACSS1
gene to the minus strand of chromosome 20p11.23-p11.21.
