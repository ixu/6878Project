DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The yeast CCR4-NOT protein complex is a global regulator of RNA
polymerase II transcription. It is comprised, in part, of CCR4 (see
608951), NOT1 to NOT5, and CAF1 (also referred to as POP2). By searching
sequence databases, Albert et al. (2000) identified human ESTs encoding
homologs of yeast NOT1, NOT2, NOT3, NOT4, and CAF1. They assembled a
human NOT2 cDNA containing a full-length coding sequence. The deduced
540-amino acid human NOT2 protein shares 26% overall sequence identity
with the 191-amino acid yeast NOT2 protein. Compared to yeast NOT2,
human NOT2 has an N-terminal extension. Human NOT2 contains an
N-terminal putative bipartite nuclear localization signal. Using the
yeast 2-hybrid assay, Albert et al. (2000) demonstrated that recombinant
human NOT2 can interact with yeast NOT1 and an N-terminally truncated
human NOT1 protein (604917); it did not significantly interact with
human NOT3 (604910) or yeast CCR4. Northern blot analysis detected a
3.2-kb NOT2 transcript in all human tissues examined, namely brain,
heart, lung, liver, kidney, small intestine, colon, spleen, thymus,
peripheral blood leukocytes, skeletal muscle, and placenta. Like the
expression of human NOT1, NOT3, and CALIF (603731), NOT2 expression was
high in brain, kidney, and placenta and very low in skeletal muscle and
colon. Albert et al. (2000) found that recombinant human NOT2 could not
complement the temperature-sensitive phenotype conferred by the yeast
not2-1 mutation.

GENE FUNCTION

Sessions et al. (2009) identified insect host factors required for
dengue virus (see 614371) propagation by carrying out a genomewide RNA
interference screen in D. melanogaster cells using a well established
22,632 double-stranded RNA library. This screen identified 116 candidate
dengue virus host factors (DVHFs). Although some were previously
associated with flaviviruses, most of the DVHFs were newly implicated in
dengue virus propagation. The dipteran DVHFs had 82 readily recognizable
human homologs and, using a targeted short interfering RNA screen, they
showed that 42 of these are human DVHFs. These include NPR2 (108961),
SEC61B (609214), TMEM214, TAZ (300394), EXDL2, and CNOT2. Sessions et
al. (2009) concluded that this overlap indicates notable conservation of
required factors between dipteran and human hosts.

602619	TITLE *602619 C-TERMINAL-BINDING PROTEIN 2; CTBP2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The E1a region of group C adenoviruses encodes 2 nearly identical
proteins that are largely responsible for the oncogenic properties of
adenoviruses. The CTBP1 (602618) protein binds to the C-terminal half of
these E1A proteins. Katsanis and Fisher (1998) identified CTBP2 by
searching for expressed sequence tags (ESTs) with homology to CTBP1. The
predicted 445-amino acid CTBP2 protein is 72% identical to CTBP1.
Northern blot analysis showed that the CTBP2 gene was expressed as a
3.8-kb mRNA in all tissues tested, with the most abundant expression in
heart, skeletal muscle, and pancreas.

Furusawa et al. (1999) identified the mouse homologs of CTBP1 and CTBP2
in a yeast 2-hybrid screen for proteins that interact with delta-EF1
(TCF8; 189909), a transcriptional repressor that binds the E2-box
(CACCTG) and related sequences. Using Northern blot analysis and in situ
hybridization with mouse embryos, Furusawa et al. (1999) detected
expression of 2 Ctbp2 transcripts confined to the embryonic stages.
Ctbp1 and Ctbp2 expression correlated with delta-EF1 expression.

Schmitz et al. (2000) identified an alternate product of the CTBP2
locus, which they named RIBEYE. They cloned full-length cDNAs
corresponding to RIBEYE in bovine, rat, and human. Human RIBEYE encodes
a deduced protein of 985 amino acids. Based on sequence analysis, the
authors defined a unique N-terminal A domain of RIBEYE and a C-terminal
B domain identical to the previously identified CTBP2. They found that
RIBEYE and CTBP2 are transcribed from distinct promoters of the CTBP2
gene. The unique N-terminal sequences of RIBEYE and CTBP2 are encoded by
separate 5-prime exons, and the shared C-terminal sequences are encoded
by 8 common 3-prime exons. By Northern blot analysis and immunoblotting,
Schmitz et al. (2000) detected a 120-kD RIBEYE product expressed only in
the retina, whereas the 50-kD CTBP2 product was observed ubiquitously in
most tissues. Using immunocytochemistry, they demonstrated that RIBEYE
is a specific component of synaptic ribbons in the retina and
hypothesized that RIBEYE may be a general component of all synaptic
ribbons. Using transfection experiments, Schmitz et al. (2000)
demonstrated that the N-terminal A domain of RIBEYE can form protein
aggregates. They hypothesized that the A domain may function in the
formation of stable ribbon structures, whereas the B domain may be
exposed on the surface of the ribbons. The B domain shares homology with
2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenases and binds to NAD+ with high affinity. They
hypothesized that the B domain may serve as an enzyme in synaptic
vesicle priming on synaptic ribbons and in transcriptional repression.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a yeast 2-hybrid assay and mutation analysis, Turner and Crossley
(1998) found that mouse Ctbp2 interacted with the pro-val-asp-leu-thr
motif in the repression domain of Bklf (KLF3; 609392). When tethered to
a promoter by a heterologous DNA-binding domain, Ctbp2 functioned as a
potent repressor. Ctbp2 also interacted with the mammalian transcription
factors Evi1 (165215), Tcf8, and Fog (ZFPM1; 601950). Turner and
Crossley (1998) concluded that CTBP2 is a mammalian corepressor that
targets diverse transcriptional regulators.

Using 2-hybrid and direct binding assays, Furusawa et al. (1999) showed
that Ctbp2 bound the short medial portion of delta-EF1 containing the
PLDLSL motif. In cotransfection experiments, they observed that Ctbp2
enhanced transrepression activity of delta-EF1. The authors hypothesized
that Ctbp1 and Ctbp2 function as corepressors of delta-EF1 action.

In Drosophila and in vertebrates, the Polycomb (Pc) group (PcG) genes
have been identified as being part of a cellular memory system that is
responsible for the stable and heritable repression of gene expression.
PC2 (603079), a human Pc homolog, CBX2 (602770), HPH1 (602978), HPH2
(602979), BMI1 (164831), and RING1 (602045) form a complex that
localizes in large nuclear domains termed PcG domains. Using a yeast
2-hybrid assay, Sewalt et al. (1999) found that CTBP2 interacts with PC2
and that Xenopus Ctbp1 interacts with Xenopus Pc. The CTBP2 and PC2
interaction also exists in vivo, since the proteins coimmunoprecipitate
with each other and partially colocalize in large PcG domains in
interphase nuclei. CTBP1 showed the same localization pattern. As with
PC2, chimeric LexA-CTBP2 and LexA-CTBP1 proteins repressed gene activity
when targeted to a reporter gene. Sewalt et al. (1999) suggested that
the CTBP proteins target PC2, and thereby the PcG complex, to particular
loci in chromatin that contain binding sites for specific repressors of
gene activity, thereby forming a complex between the repressors and the
PcG complex, with CTBP as a bridging protein. They speculated that the
interference of the adenoviral E1A protein with the transcription
machinery of the infected cell may involve interference with
PcG-mediated repression through disruption of the CTBP-PcG interaction.

Zhang et al. (2002) demonstrated that CTBP binding to cellular and viral
transcriptional repressors is regulated by NAD+ and NADH, with NADH
being 2 to 3 orders of magnitude more effective. Levels of free nuclear
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotides, determined using 2-photon
microscopy, corresponded to the levels required for half-maximal CTBP
binding and were considerably lower than those previously reported.
Agents capable of increasing NADH levels stimulated CTBP binding to its
partners in vivo and potentiated CTBP-mediated repression. Zhang et al.
(2002) proposed that this ability to detect changes in nuclear NAD+/NADH
ratio allows CTBP to serve as a redox sensor for transcription.

CTBP is recruited to DNA by transcription factors that contain a PXDLS
motif. Shi et al. (2003) reported the identification of a CTBP complex
that contains the essential components for both gene targeting and
coordinated histone modifications, allowing for the effective repression
of genes targeted by CTBP. This complex has a molecular mass of about
1.3 to 1.5 million and contains CTBP1 and CTBP2 as well as G9A (604599),
EUHMT (607001), COREST (607675), HDAC1 (601241) and HDAC2 (605164),
NPAO, REBB1, ZNF217 (602967), and KIAA0222. Immunoprecipitation with G9A
antibodies brought down the same components as well as HPC2 (ELAC2;
605367). Shi et al. (2003) found that inhibiting the expression of CTBP
and its associated histone-modifying activities by RNA-interference
resulted in alterations of histone modifications at the promoter of the
tumor invasion suppressor gene E-cadherin (192090) and increased
promoter activity in a reporter assay.

Using a promoter pull-down assay followed by mass spectrometry analysis,
Flajollet et al. (2009) identified RREB1 (602209) as a protein that
bound the HLA-G (142871) promoter. RREB1 exerted repressive activity on
the promoter in HLA-G-negative cells that was mediated by recruitment of
HDAC1 and CTBP1 and/or CTBP2. The HLA-G promoter contains 3 RREB1 target
sites. Flajollet et al. (2009) proposed that the repressive activity of
RREB1 on the HLA-G promoter may be regulated by posttranslational
modifications governing its association with CTBP.
