;;DEMATIN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Dematin, or EPB49, is an actin-bundling protein originally identified in
the erythroid membrane skeleton. Its actin-bundling activity is
abolished upon phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase and is
restored after dephosphorylation (Rana et al., 1993).

CLONING

Chishti et al. (1989) proposed the name dematin (from the Greek 'dema,'
a bundle) for an actin-bundling protein identified in the human
erythroid membrane skeleton. Rana et al. (1993) noted that dematin
consists of 2 polypeptide chains of 48 and 52 kD that were identified as
protein 4.9 on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. In solution, dematin exists as a
trimer and bundles actin filaments in a phosphorylation-dependent
manner. Rana et al. (1993) cloned dematin from a human reticulocyte cDNA
library. The deduced 383-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular
mass of 43 kD. Dematin has a polyglutamine motif that may constitute a
nuclear localization signal, a PEST sequence, a C-terminal domain highly
similar to the C-terminal headpiece domain of villin (VIL; 193040), and
several putative phosphorylation sites. Northern blot analysis detected
variable dematin expression in all tissues examined. Immunofluorescence
microscopy revealed punctate dematin staining around the cell nucleus in
cultured human erythroblasts.

Although dematin is an actin-bundling protein of the erythroid membrane
skeleton, it is abundantly expressed in human brain, heart, skeletal
muscle, kidney, and lung. Azim et al. (1995) reported the primary
structure of the 52-kD subunit of dematin, which differs from the 48-kD
subunit by a 22-amino acid insertion within its headpiece domain. A
unique feature of the insertion sequence of the 52-kD subunit is its
homology to erythrocyte protein 4.2 (177070).

GENE FUNCTION

Rana et al. (1993) confirmed that purified human dematin possessed
actin-bundling activity in vitro. Protease treatment and microsequencing
revealed that the C-terminal headpiece domain bound actin filaments, but
it did not have actin-bundling activity.

Azim et al. (1996) demonstrated that dematin and protein 4.2 bound ATP.

Gilligan and Bennett (1993) provided a review.

MAPPING

Using somatic cell hybrid panels and fluorescence in situ hybridization,
Azim et al. (1995) localized the dematin gene to chromosome 8p21.1, a
site distal to the locus of ankyrin (612641) at chromosome 8p11.2.

Peters et al. (1995) demonstrated that the murine dematin gene,
symbolized Epb4.9, maps to chromosome 14. They raised the possibility
that dematin mutations may be involved in neurologic abnormalities in
the mouse.

ANIMAL MODEL

By using homologous recombination in mouse embryonic stem cells, Khanna
et al. (2002) deleted the headpiece domain of dematin to evaluate its
function in vivo. Dematin headpiece-null mice were viable and born at
the expected mendelian ratio. Hematologic evaluation showed evidence of
compensated anemia and spherocytosis in these mice, however. The
headpiece-null erythrocytes were osmotically fragile, and displayed
reduced deformability and filterability. In vitro, significantly greater
membrane fragmentation of these erythrocytes was demonstrated.
Biochemical characterization showed a weakened membrane skeleton
evidenced by reduced association of spectrin and actin to the plasma
membrane. Together, these results provided evidence for the physiologic
significance of dematin and demonstrated a role for the headpiece domain
in the maintenance of structural integrity and mechanical properties of
red cells in vivo.

Chen et al. (2007) created double-knockout mice lacking beta-adducin
(ADD2; 102681) and the headpiece domain of dematin. Double-knockout pups
were pale compared with wildtype pups, but otherwise they appeared
grossly normal. Peripheral blood analysis showed severe hemolytic anemia
with reduced number of erythrocytes/hematocrit/hemoglobin and an
approximately 12-fold increase in the number of circulating
reticulocytes. The presence of a variety of misshapen and fragmented
erythrocytes correlated with increased osmotic fragility and reduced in
vivo life span. Mutant erythrocyte membranes showed weak retention of
spectrin-actin complexes, increased grain size, decreased filament
number, and features consistent with the presence of large protein
aggregates. Chen et al. (2007) concluded that dematin and adducin are
essential for the maintenance of erythrocyte shape and membrane
stability.
