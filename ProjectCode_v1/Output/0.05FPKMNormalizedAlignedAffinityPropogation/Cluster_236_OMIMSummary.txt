611838	TITLE *611838 MITOCHONDRIAL RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN L30; MRPL30
;;MRPL28
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Mitochondria have their own translation system for production of 13
proteins essential for oxidative phosphorylation. MRPL30 is 1 of more
than 70 protein components of mitochondrial ribosomes that are encoded
by the nuclear genome (Kenmochi et al., 2001).

CLONING

By searching databases for homologs of rat Mrpl28, Goldschmidt-Reisin et
al. (1998) identified mouse and human MRPL30, which they called MRPL28.
The deduced 162-amino acid human MRPL30 protein contains a 34-amino acid
N-terminal mitochondrial import signal.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis and analysis of an integrated BAC-STS map,
Kenmochi et al. (2001) mapped the MRPL30 gene to chromosome 2q11.2.

238310	TITLE *238310 AMINOMETHYLTRANSFERASE; AMT
;;GLYCINE CLEAVAGE SYSTEM T PROTEIN; GCST
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The enzyme system for cleavage of glycine (glycine cleavage system; EC
2.1.2.10), which is confined to the mitochondria, is composed of 4
protein components: P protein (a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent glycine
decarboxylase; GLDC, 238300), H protein (a lipoic acid-containing
protein; GCSH, 238330), T protein (a tetrahydrofolate-requiring enzyme),
and L protein (a lipoamide dehydrogenase; DLD, 238331).

Mutations in the T, P, and H proteins have been found to cause glycine
encephalopathy (GCE; 605899).

CLONING

The T protein of the glycine cleavage system is also known as
aminomethyltransferase (AMT). Nanao et al. (1994) isolated the AMT gene
from a human placenta cosmid library. They found that the gene is about
6 kb long and contains 9 exons. They identified 2 putative
glucocorticoid-responsive elements and a putative thyroid
hormone-responsive element. By dot-blot analysis, Kure et al. (2001)
detected expression of AMT in all tissues tested except stomach and bone
marrow.

GENE FUNCTION

Sakata et al. (2001) reported the structure and expression of the
glycine cleavage system in rat central nervous system.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Nanao et al. (1994) assigned the
AMT gene to 3p21.2-p21.1.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In patients with glycine encephalopathy, Nanao et al. (1994) identified
mutations in the AMT gene (238310.0001-238310.0002).

Toone et al. (2000) studied 14 unrelated patients with glycine
encephalopathy and identified mutations in 4 cases. In 2 patients,
mutations were identified in the T protein: 1 patient was homozygous for
an arg320-to-his mutation (R320H; 238310.0006), and the other patient
was heterozygous for a novel glutamine-to-termination substitution at
codon 192 (238310.0007).

Applegarth and Toone (2001) reviewed the laboratory diagnosis of glycine
encephalopathy and confirmed 9 mutations in the T protein and 8
mutations in the P protein. They also reviewed the 7 cases of transient
NKH known at that time.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
GLYCINE ENCEPHALOPATHY
AMT, GLY269ASP

Nanao et al. (1994) found that a patient with typical glycine
encephalopathy (605899) was homozygous for a missense mutation in the
AMT gene, a G-to-A transition leading to a gly-to-asp substitution at
amino acid 269 (G269D).

.0002
GLYCINE ENCEPHALOPATHY
AMT, GLY47ARG

In 2 sisters with atypical glycine encephalopathy (605899), Nanao et al.
(1994) found compound heterozygosity for 2 missense mutations in the T
protein gene: a G-to-A transition leading to a gly-to-arg substitution
at amino acid 47 (G47R) in 1 allele, and a G-to-A transition leading to
an arg-to-his substitution at amino acid 320 (R320H; 238310.0006) in the
other allele. Nanao et al. (1994) pointed out that gly269, which was
mutant in the typically severe case they studied (see 238300.0001), is
conserved in T proteins of various species, even in E. coli, whereas
gly47 and arg320, which were mutant in the atypical and milder cases,
are replaced by ala and leu, respectively, in E. coli. Thus, mutation
occurring in more conservative amino acid residues results in more
deleterious damage to the T protein and a more severe clinical
phenotype.

.0003
GLYCINE ENCEPHALOPATHY
AMT, HIS42ARG

Kure et al. (1998) reported a large Israeli-Arab kindred with glycine
encephalopathy (605899). Enzymatic analysis demonstrated that T-protein
activity was deficient in the liver from 1 affected person in the
family. Mutation detection revealed a missense mutation in exon 2
resulting in an amino acid substitution from histidine to arginine at
position 42 (his42 to arg). Homozygosity for the H42R mutation was seen
in all affected members of the family.

.0004
GLYCINE ENCEPHALOPATHY
AMT, 1-BP DEL, 183C

In a Japanese patient with glycine encephalopathy (605899), Kure et al.
(1998) described a 1-bp deletion (183delC) and a missense mutation,
asp276 to his (238310.0005).

.0005
GLYCINE ENCEPHALOPATHY
AMT, ASP276HIS

In a Japanese patient with glycine encephalopathy (605899) of neonatal
onset, Kure et al. (1998) found a G-to-C substitution at position 955 in
exon 7, resulting in an amino acid change from aspartate to histidine at
position 276.

.0006
GLYCINE ENCEPHALOPATHY
AMT, ARG320HIS

See 238310.0001 and Nanao et al. (1994).

Toone et al. (2001) screened a DNA bank from 50 patients with
enzymatically confirmed NKH and identified the arg320-to-his (R320H)
mutation in 7% of alleles.

.0007
GLYCINE ENCEPHALOPATHY
AMT, GLN192TER

In a patient with neonatal-onset NKH (605899), Toone et al. (2000)
identified a C-to-T transition resulting in a glutamine-to-termination
codon substitution at residue 192 (Q192X). The other mutation in this
patient was not identified.

.0008
GLYCINE ENCEPHALOPATHY
AMT, IVS7, G-A, -1

Toone et al. (2001) reported a novel splice site mutation at the -1
position of intron 7 of the AMT gene: G was converted to A. This
mutation was found in 3 unrelated families and was not found in any
normal controls.

600756	TITLE *600756 PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE 2, REGULATORY SUBUNIT B-PRIME; PPP2R4
;;PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE 2A, REGULATORY SUBUNIT B-PRIME;;
PHOSPHOTYROSYL PHOSPHATASE ACTIVATOR; PTPA;;
PR53
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

PPP2R4, or PTPA, encodes a specific phosphotyrosyl phosphatase activator
of the dimeric form of protein phosphatase-2A (PP2A; see 176915) (Van
Hoof et al., 1995).

GENE FUNCTION

The core component of PP2A consists of a catalytic (C) subunit (e.g.,
PPP2CA; 176915) and a scaffold protein (A) subunit (e.g., PPP2R1A;
605983). Using purified recombinant proteins, Chao et al. (2006) found
that PTPA and PP2A A-C dimers constituted a composite ATPase, and the
interaction was independent of ATP or magnesium ion. The inclusion of
PTPA altered the substrate specificity of PP2A, with enhanced
phosphotyrosine phosphatase activity and decreased phosphoserine
phosphatase activity.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Chao et al. (2006) reported the 1.9-angstrom crystal structure of human
PTPA, which revealed a fold consisting of a core, a lid, and an extended
linker joining the core and lid. Structural analysis uncovered a highly
conserved surface patch bordering these 3 subdomains, as well as an
associated deep pocket between the core and linker subdomains. Further
analysis showed that the surface patch binds the PP2A A-C dimer, and the
deep pocket binds ATP.

GENE STRUCTURE

Van Hoof et al. (1995) demonstrated that human PTPA is encoded by a
single-copy gene composed of 10 exons and 9 introns with a total length
of about 60 kb. The 5-prime flanking sequence of the transcription start
site was analyzed for its potential as a promoter. This region lacks a
TATA sequence in the appropriate position relative to the transcription
start. However, this region is very GC-rich and contains 4 Sp1 sites
(SP1; 189906) upstream of the transcription start site, a feature common
to many TATA-less promoters. Based on homology with DNA-binding
consensus sequences of transcription factors, Van Hoof et al. (1995)
identified several additional putative transcription factor binding
sites in the promoter region. Transfection experiments with a construct
containing the PTPA promoter region inserted 5-prime of a luciferase
reporter gene demonstrated that the 5-prime flanking sequence of the
PTPA gene indeed has promoter activity that seems to be cell-line
dependent.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Van Hoof et al. (1995) mapped the
PTPA gene to 9q34. Fluorescence in situ analysis of metaphase
chromosomes of patients bearing the Philadelphia chromosome indicated
that PTPA is positioned centromeric of ABL1 (189980) and probably is not
involved in chronic myeloid leukemia.

603894	TITLE *603894 REGULATOR OF G PROTEIN SIGNALING 6; RGS6
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the RGS (regulator of G protein signaling) family, such as
RGS6, modulate G protein function by activating the intrinsic GTPase
activity of the alpha (guanine nucleotide-binding) subunits (Seki et
al., 1999).

CLONING

By EST database analysis and PCR of a brain cDNA library, Posner et al.
(1999) obtained a full-length cDNA encoding RGS6. The predicted
472-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 54.4 kD. It
contains an N-terminal dishevelled (see 601365)/egl10/pleckstrin
(173570) (DEP) domain, a central G protein gamma subunit (see GNG2;
606981)-like (GGL) domain, and an RGS domain near the C terminus.

Using RT-PCR, Seki et al. (1999) showed that RGS6 was expressed in
various tissues.

By PCR of a brain cDNA library, Chatterjee et al. (2003) identified 36
RGS6 splice variants resulting from the use of 2 alternative
transcription sites and complex alternative splicing. The variants
encode proteins with long or short N-terminal domains, complete or
incomplete GGL domains, 7 distinct C-terminal domains, and a common
internal domain that includes the RGS domain.

GENE FUNCTION

Posner et al. (1999) expressed RGS6 in insect cells and found that it
formed a cytosolic heterodimer via its GGL domain with the G protein
beta-5 (GNB5; 604447) subunit, but not with other G protein beta
subunits tested. The RGS6/GNB5 complex acted as a GTPase-activating
protein, but it did not form heterotrimeric complexes with G-alpha-o
(GNAO1; 139311)-GDP or G-alpha-q (GNAQ; 600998)-GDP, it did not alter
activity of adenyl cyclase types I, II, or V, and it did not activate
phospholipase C-beta-1 (PLCB1; 607120) or PLCB2 (604114). However, the
RGS6/GNB5 complex inhibited GNB1/GNG2-mediated activation of PLCB2.

Chatterjee et al. (2003) found that RGS6 isoforms with complete GGL
domains interacted with GNB5, irrespective of their N-terminal domain,
following expression in COS-7 cells. In contrast, RGS6 isoforms lacking
a complete GGL domain did not interact with GNB5. Subcellular
distribution patterns for RGS6 isoforms ranged from exclusively
cytoplasmic to exclusively nuclear/nucleolar, and coexpression of GNB5
promoted nuclear localization of RGS6 isoforms.

GENE STRUCTURE

Sierra et al. (2002) determined that the RGS6 gene contains 17 exons.
Chatterjee et al. (2003) determined that the RGS6 gene contains 20 exons
and spans 630 kb.

MAPPING

By somatic cell and radiation hybrid analysis, Seki et al. (1999) mapped
the RGS6 gene to chromosome 14q24.3.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In an epidemiologic study of 477 bladder cancer patients and 446 matched
controls, Berman et al. (2004) identified 3 noncoding SNPs in RGS2
(600861) and RGS6 that were each associated with a significantly reduced
risk of bladder cancer. When analyzed separately, a C-to-T SNP in the
3-prime UTR of RGS6, dbSNP rs2074647, conferred the greatest overall
reduction in bladder cancer risk, with a significant odds ratio of 0.66.
The reduction of risk was more pronounced in those who had ever smoked.
Expression of dbSNP rs2074647 increased the activity of a luciferase-RGS
fusion protein nearly 3-fold. PCR analysis confirmed that RGS6 splice
variants were expressed in bladder cancer tissue and cell lines. Berman
et al. (2004) proposed that RGS proteins may be important modulators of
cancer risk.

610603	TITLE *610603 AlkB, E. COLI, HOMOLOG OF, 3; ALKBH3
;;PROSTATE CANCER ANTIGEN 1; PCA1;;
DEPC1;;
ABH3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The Escherichia coli AlkB protein protects against the cytotoxicity of
methylating agents by repair of the specific DNA lesions generated in
single-stranded DNA. ALKBH2 (610602) and ALKBH3 are E. coli AlkB
homologs that catalyze the removal of 1-methyladenine and
3-methylcytosine (Duncan et al., 2002).

CLONING

By searching human genomic and cDNA databases with ALKBH1 (605345) as
query, Duncan et al. (2002) obtained a full-length cDNA of ALKBH3. The
deduced protein shares 23.1% amino acid identity over the core region
with E. coli AlkB and shares similarity to
alpha-ketoglutarate/Fe(II)-dependent dioxygenases in the C-terminal
region. It has a predicted tertiary structure with high similarity to
the crystal structure of known dioxygenases. Northern blot analysis
detected ALKBH3 expression in all tissues examined, as well as several
carcinoma cell lines, with highest expression in spleen, prostate,
bladder and colon. Immunofluorescence studies localized ALKBH3 to the
nucleus in a diffuse pattern and to the cytoplasm.

Using fluorescent differential display analysis to identify genes
upregulated in prostate cancer, followed by RT-PCR and 5-prime RACE,
Konishi et al. (2005) cloned ALKBH3, which they called PCA1. The deduced
286-amino acid protein has an N-terminal signal sequence and a
C-terminal 2-oxoglutarate/Fe(II)-dependent oxygenase domain.
Quantitative real-time PCR detected PCA1 in all tissues examined, with
highest expression in pancreas and testis. Western blot analysis of
prostate cancer cell lines detected PCA1 at an apparent molecular mass
of about 40 kD. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that 90% (63 of
70) prostate cancer specimens were positive for PCA1. Staining was
confined to cancerous cells in the prostate tissue sample and was most
often exhibited by atypical epithelia in high-grade prostatic
intraepithelial neoplasias. Little to no staining was seen in adjacent
normal epithelium, in benign prostatic hyperplasia, or in several other
cancers tested.

Using quantitative real-time PCR, Tsujikawa et al. (2007) found variable
ABH3 expression in all 16 tissues examined, with highest expression in
pancreas, followed by ovary, liver, and testis. Fluorescence-tagged ABH3
was expressed diffusely in the cytoplasm and more strongly in the
nucleus of transfected HeLa cells

GENE FUNCTION

Using purified GST- and histidine-tagged ALKBH3 overexpressed in E.
coli, Duncan et al. (2002) showed that ALKBH3 catalyzed the removal of
both 1-methyladenine and 3-methylcytosine from methylated
polynucleotides. ALKBH3 directly reverted 3-methylcytosine to cytosine
and can also repair ethylated DNA bases through a mechanism similar to
E. coli AlkB activity.

By examining PCA1-transfected and control COS-7 cells, Konishi et al.
(2005) demonstrated that PCA1 conferred resistance against methylmethane
sulfonate-induced cell damage, indicative of demethylation activity.

GENE STRUCTURE

Konishi et al. (2005) determined that the ALKBH3 gene contains at least
10 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Duncan et al. (2002) mapped the ALKBH3
gene to chromosome 11q11. By genomic sequence analysis, Konishi et al.
(2005) mapped the ALKBH3 gene to chromosome 11p11.12.

ANIMAL MODEL

Ringvoll et al. (2006) generated mice with targeted disruption of Abh2
(ALKBH2; 610602), Abh3, and Abh2/Abh3 double-knockout mice. Both single-
and double-knockout mice were viable and appeared normal into adulthood.
Using genomic DNA isolated from liver samples, the authors showed that
Abh2-null mice displayed an increased accumulation of 1-methyladenine
compared to wildtype and Abh3-null mice. Embryonic fibroblasts derived
from Abh2-null mice exhibited a decreased ability to remove methyl
methane sulfate (MMS)-induced 1-methyladenine from genomic DNA compared
to fibroblasts from both wildtype and Abh3-null mice. Ringvoll et al.
(2006) concluded that Abh2 and Abh3 have different roles in repair of
DNA damage caused by alkylating agents with Abh2 being the primary
oxidative demethylase for repair of 1-methyladenine and 3-methylcytosine
in double-stranded DNA.

613664	TITLE *613664 SMOOTHELIN-LIKE 1; SMTNL1
;;CALPONIN HOMOLOGY-ASSOCIATED SMOOTH MUSCLE PROTEIN; CHASM
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SMTNL1, which is a member of the smoothelin (SMTN; 602127) family,
regulates contraction and relaxation of skeletal and smooth muscle
fibers and mediates vascular adaptation to exercise (Wooldridge et al.,
2008).

CLONING

Borman et al. (2004) cloned mouse Smtnl1, which they called Chasm. The
deduced 459-amino acid protein contains a C-terminal calponin homology
(CH) domain and a single potential serine phosphorylation site.

Using Western blot analysis, Wooldridge et al. (2008) showed that Smtnl1
was expressed in mouse skeletal muscle and heart and in tissues
containing smooth muscle. Smtnl1 was preferentially expressed in
striated muscles containing type 1 or type 2a fibers. Immunofluorescence
confocal microscopy revealed that Smtnl1 localized to the I band and M
line, but was absent in the Z line. In human muscle, SMTNL1 expression
appeared specific to type 2a fibers.

GENE FUNCTION

Smooth muscle can relax passively due to removal of the contractile
stimulus, or it can relax actively via cyclin nucleotide-dependent
protein kinases, such as PKA (see 176911) without a change in
contractile stimuli or intracellular calcium concentration, a phenomena
called calcium desensitization. Borman et al. (2004) showed that mouse
Chasm could relax permeabilized and submaximally contracted rabbit ileum
smooth muscle in a concentration-dependent manner. Chasm was
phosphorylated by PKA and PKG (see 176894) in vitro at the single serine
phosphorylation site, and Chasm was phosphorylated during the early
stages of smooth muscle relaxation.

Wooldridge et al. (2008) found that dephosphorylated mouse Smtnl1
inhibited the activity of mouse myosin phosphatase (see 603768), while
phosphorylation of Smtnl1 by PKA or PKG inactivated Smtnl1 and permitted
myosin dephosphorylation. In both isolated smooth and striated mouse
muscle, Smtnl1 was serine phosphorylated in response to agonists that
elevate intracellular cAMP or cGMP. Maximal phosphorylation of Smtnl1
correlated with maximal relaxation of aorta in response to
acetylcholine.

Lontay et al. (2010) showed that the expression of SMTNL1 was
upregulated in uterus during pregnancy in humans and mice. In mice,
pregnancy induced the expression of Smtnl1 in vascular and uterine
smooth muscle and in type 2a skeletal muscle fibers, and appeared to be
regulated by sex hormones. A concomitant increase in the myosin
phosphatase subunit Mypt1 (PPP1R12A; 602021) was also observed.
Coimmunoprecipitation experiments and immunofluorescence microscopy
revealed that Smtnl1 bound and colocalized with Mypt1 in diffuse
cytosolic and discrete nuclear localizations. Agonist-dependent
phosphorylation of Smtnl1 resulted in its nuclear translocation.

MAPPING

Hartz (2010) mapped the SMTNL1 gene to chromosome 11q12.1 based on an
alignment of the SMTNL1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AA111832) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

ANIMAL MODEL

Wooldridge et al. (2008) found that deletion of Smtnl1 in mice had no
effect on basal activity, litter size, or embryonic development.
However, Smtnl1 -/- mice showed a PKA/PKG-mediated adaption to exercise,
exhibiting better exercise performance and improved
vasorelaxation/contractile responses compared with wildtype littermates.
Expression of Smtnl1 in wildtype animals was reduced with exercise, and
this effect was stronger in female mice. Vascular smooth muscle from
sedentary and exercise-trained female Smtnl1 -/- mice exhibited more
significant changes in responsiveness to beta- and alpha-adrenergic
agonists than their male counterparts. Exercise also induced more
significant reduction of Smtnl1 expression in females compared with
males. Striated muscle from male Smtnl1 -/- mice showed a greater
tendency to switch to an oxidative phenotype. Wooldridge et al. (2008)
concluded that receptor-mediated pathways can acutely regulate SMTNL1
function through serine phosphorylation, whereas exercise achieves the
same effect by reducing SMTNL1 expression.

Lontay et al. (2010) found that pregnant Smtnl1 -/- mice showed
increased expression of Mypt1 in vascular and uterine smooth muscle, and
isolated thoracic aorta from pregnant Smtn1l -/- females showed profound
reduction in isometric force compared with aorta from pregnant wildtype
females.

610223	TITLE *610223 RAS AND RAB INTERACTOR 3; RIN3
;;RAB5-INTERACTING PROTEIN 3;;
FLJ22439
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

RIN3 is a member of the RIN family of Ras interaction-interference
proteins, which are binding partners to the RAB5 small GTPases (see
RAB5A; 179512) (Kajiho et al., 2003).

CLONING

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis with GTPase-deficient mutant RAB5B
(179514) as bait, followed by 3-prime and 5-prime RACE of a human
leukocyte cDNA library, Kajiho et al. (2003) cloned the RIN3 gene. The
deduced 985-amino acid protein shares features with RIN1 (605965) and
RIN2 (610222), including an SH2 domain, a Vps9 domain, and a conserved
centrally located 100-amino acid RIN homology domain. RIN3 contains 3
proline-rich domains (PRDs), while RIN1 and RIN2 have 1 and 2 PRDs,
respectively. Northern blot analysis detected a 4-kb transcript in all
human tissues examined, with highest expression in peripheral blood
cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Kajiho et al. (2003) showed that RIN3 bound GTP preferentially over GDP
and acted as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor on RAB5B. By
immunostaining and confocal microscopy of RIN3 transiently expressed in
HeLa cells, they colocalized RIN3 and RAB5 to punctate vesicles in the
cytoplasm and found that vesicular localization of RIN3 required the
RIN3 C-terminal region, suggesting that RIN3 binding to RAB5 is needed
for vesicular localization. In HeLa cells expressing RIN3, transferrin
(TF; 190000) was transported partly through RIN3-positive vesicles to
early endosomes, suggesting that RIN3 plays a role in intracellular
transport from plasma membranes to early endosomes. Yeast 2-hybrid
analysis and GST pull-down assays showed that RIN3 interacted through
its N-terminal PRDs with the SH3 domain of amphiphysin II (BIN1;
601248). Through confocal microscopy of HeLa cells coexpressing RIN3 and
amphiphysin II, Kajiho et al. (2003) found that cytoplasmic amphiphysin
II translocated into RIN3-positive vesicles and that this localization
was dependent on RIN3 interaction with the amphiphysin II SH3 domain.
Kajiho et al. (2003) suggested that RIN3, RAB5, and amphiphysin II form
a ternary complex that is involved in the early endocytic transport
pathway.

By assaying recombinant proteins in vitro and following expression in
transfected cells, Kajiho et al. (2011) found that RIN3 functioned as a
GEF for RAB31 (605694), in addition to RAB5, but not for RAB21 (612398).
Mutation analysis revealed that the VPS9 domain was responsible for RIN3
GEF activity. Cotransfection of RAB31 with RIN3 in HeLa cells resulted
in coexpression of RIN3 and RAB31 in enlarged vesicles and
tubulovesicular structures. Mutation of 8 serines to alanine in an
internal sequence of RIN3 between the SH2 and RIN family homology domain
decreased the interaction of RIN3 with RAB31, but not with RAB5. These
mutations also inhibited the GEF activity of RIN3 for RAB31.
Coexpression of RIN3 with CDMPR (M6PR; 154540) reduced the amount of
CDMPR with the trans-Golgi network and increased the amount of CDMPR
associated with perinuclear endosomes in a way that depended on the GEF
activity of RIN3 for RAB31. Kajiho et al. (2011) concluded that RIN3
acts as a GEF to regulate RAB31-dependent transport between the
trans-Golgi network and early endosomes.

MAPPING

Hartz (2011) mapped the RIN3 gene to chromosome 14q32.12 based on an
alignment of the RIN3 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK026092) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

607614	TITLE *607614 NUCLEOPORIN, 160-KD; NUP160
;;KIAA0197
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

NUP160 is 1 of up to 60 proteins that make up the 120-MD nuclear pore
complex, which mediates nucleoplasmic transport.

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated myeloid cell line
cDNA library, Nagase et al. (1996) cloned NUP160, which they designated
KIAA0197. The deduced 1,314-amino acid protein contains a histidine acid
phosphatase motif. Northern blot analysis revealed moderate expression
in all tissues examined.

Vasu et al. (2001) identified Nup160 as a protein in Xenopus egg
extracts that interacts with the nuclear pore basket proteins Nup98
(601021) and Nup153 (603948). Peptide analysis revealed homology with
KIAA0197. Antibody raised against the putative human protein detected
endogenous NUP160 in puncta along the nuclear rim in HeLa cells, and
differential permeabilization of HeLa cells indicated that NUP160 is
localized to the basket side of the pore, facing the nucleoplasm.

GENE FUNCTION

Vasu et al. (2001) provided evidence that vertebrate Nup160 and Nup133
(607613) interact with Nup98 and Nup153 and mediate RNA export from the
nucleus.

MAPPING

By analysis of a panel of human-rodent hybrid cell lines, Nagase et al.
(1996) mapped the NUP160 gene to chromosome 11.

609666	TITLE *609666 TWO-PORE SEGMENT CHANNEL 1; TPCN1
;;TWO-PORE CHANNEL 1; TPC1;;
KIAA1169
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Voltage-gated Ca(2+) and Na+ channels have 4 homologous domains, each
containing 6 transmembrane segments, S1 to S6. TPCN1 is similar to these
channels, but it has only 2 domains containing S1 to S6 (Ishibashi et
al., 2000).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated human brain cDNA
library, Hirosawa et al. (1999) cloned TPCN1, which they designated
KIAA1169. The deduced 775-amino acid protein, which may be N-terminally
truncated, contains motifs associated with ion transport proteins.
RT-PCR ELISA detected robust expression in all adult and fetal tissues
and specific brain regions examined. Highest expression was in heart and
kidney, and lowest expression was in spleen.

Ishibashi et al. (2000) cloned rat Tpcn1, which they called Tpc1. The
deduced 819-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 94.6
kD. It contains 2 homologous domains, each of which has 6 transmembrane
segments (S1 to S6) and a putative pore loop between S5 and S6. Northern
blot analysis detected a 5-kb transcript expressed at highest levels in
rat kidney, followed by liver, lung, and spleen. In rat kidney, Tpc1 was
expressed at the apical membrane of medullary collecting ducts. By EST
database analysis, Ishibashi et al. (2000) identified likely human and
plant orthologs of Tpc1.

GENE FUNCTION

Calcraft et al. (2009) showed that 2-pore channels (TPCs) comprise a
family of nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP)
receptors, with human TPC1 and chicken TPC3 being expressed on endosomal
membranes, and human TPC2 on lysosomal membranes when expressed in
HEK293 cells. Membranes enriched with TPC2 show high affinity NAADP
binding, and TPC2 underpins NAADP-induced Ca(2+) release from
lysosome-related stores that is subsequently amplified by Ca(2+)-induced
Ca(2+) release by inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (InsP3Rs).
Responses to NAADP were abolished by disrupting the lysosomal proton
gradient and by ablating TPC2 expression, but were only attenuated by
depleting endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) stores or by blocking InsP3Rs.
Thus, TPCs form NAADP receptors that release Ca(2+) from acidic
organelles, which can trigger further Ca(2+) signals via
sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum. Calcraft et al. (2009) concluded
that TPCs provide insights into the regulation and organization of
Ca(2+) signals in animal cells.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the TPCN1
gene to chromosome 12 (TMAP D12S1195E).

614277	TITLE *614277 UBIQUITIN-CONJUGATING ENZYME 2W; UBE2W
;;UBC16, ARABIDOPSIS, HOMOLOG OF; UBC16
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Ubiquitination is a common posttranslational modification that plays
roles in many cellular pathways and in protein degradation. Conjugation
of ubiquitin to substrate proteins requires an E1 ubiquitin-activating
enzyme (e.g., UBE1; 314370), an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (e.g.,
UBE2A; 312180), and an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase (e.g., UBE3A;
601623). UBE2W is an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (summary by Zhang
et al., 2011).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a human fetal brain cDNA library, Yin
et al. (2006) cloned UBE2W, which they called UBC16. The deduced
162-amino acid protein has an approximately 150-amino acid catalytic
core, termed the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (UBC) domain, which
contains 2 nuclear localization signals at its C-terminal end. Human
UBC16 shares 51% amino acid identity with Arabidopsis Ubc16. RT-PCR
detected ubiquitous UBC16 expression, with highest expression in heart,
brain, liver, and pancreas. Fluorescence-tagged UBC16 localized to
nuclei of transfected HEK293 cells.

GENE FUNCTION

By mutation analysis, Yin et al. (2006) showed that nuclear localization
of human UBC in transfected HEK293 cells required both the nuclear
localization signals and enzyme activity.

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Zhang et al. (2011) showed that mouse
Ube2w interacted with Fancl (608111), an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in
DNA damage repair. They confirmed the interaction by protein pull-down
and coimmunoprecipitation analyses. Fancl showed a ubiquitous
intracellular localization in the absence of Ube2w and a nuclear
localization in the presence of Ube2w. Ube2w formed nuclear homodimers.
Ube2w exhibited ubiquitin-conjugating activity and monoubiquitinated the
PHD domain of Fancl in vitro. Ubiquitination by Ube2w required a
conserved active-site cysteine within its ubiquitin-conjugating domain.
Ube2w also monoubiquitinated Fancd2 (613984). Downregulation of UBE2W in
human cell lines markedly reduced FANCD2 monoubiquitination caused by
ultraviolet irradiation, but not FANCD2 monoubiquitination caused by the
DNA crosslinking agent mitomycin C or FANCD2 monoubiquitination that
occurs normally during S phase.

GENE STRUCTURE

Yin et al. (2006) determined that the UBE2W gene contains 7 exons and
spans 8.6 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Yin et al. (2006) mapped the UBE2W gene to
chromosome 8q13-q21.1.

609825	TITLE *609825 COQ2, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; COQ2
;;PARAHYDROXYBENZOATE-POLYPRENYLTRANSFERASE, MITOCHONDRIAL
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CoQ (ubiquinone) serves as a redox carrier in the mitochondrial
respiratory chain and is a lipid-soluble antioxidant. COQ2, or
parahydroxybenzoate-polyprenyltransferase (EC 2.5.1.39), catalyzes one
of the final reactions in the biosynthesis of CoQ, the prenylation of
parahydroxybenzoate with an all-trans polyprenyl group (Forsgren et al.,
2004).

CLONING

By database analysis, followed by RT-PCR and RACE of human liver and
skeletal muscle cDNA libraries, Forsgren et al. (2004) cloned COQ2. The
deduced 421-amino acid protein contains a central polyprenyl
diphosphate-binding site, followed by 6 C-terminal transmembrane
regions. COQ2 was predicted to localize to mitochondria. Northern blot
analysis detected abundant expression of a 1.8-kb transcript in skeletal
muscle. RNA dot-blot analysis detected COQ2 in all adult and fetal
tissues examined, with highest levels in skeletal muscle, adrenal gland,
and heart.

GENE FUNCTION

Forsgren et al. (2004) found that human COQ2 rescued the growth of
Coq2-null yeast cells and restored CoQ biosynthesis. CoQ formed when
cells were incubated with labeled decaprenyl pyrophosphate and
nonaprenyl pyrophosphate, indicating that human COQ2 participates in the
biosynthesis of CoQ.

GENE STRUCTURE

Forsgren et al. (2004) determined that the COQ2 gene contains 7 exons
and spans more than 20.7 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Forsgren et al. (2004) mapped the COQ2
gene to chromosome 4q21-q22.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Primary Coenzyme Q10 Deficiency 1

Using homozygosity mapping and sequence analysis, Quinzii et al. (2006)
detected a homozygous A-to-G transition at nucleotide 890 of the COQ2
gene in a patient with coenzyme Q10 deficiency-1 (COQ10D1; 607486). The
mutation was predicted to change amino acid 297 from tyrosine to
cysteine (Y297C; 609825.0001) in the third of 6 predicted transmembrane
domains of the COQ2 protein. The transition was heterozygous in both
parents and absent in healthy individuals.

Mollet et al. (2007) reported a French family with COQ10 deficiency that
manifested as fatal infantile multiorgan disease. Enzymologic analysis
showed low quinone-dependent oxidative phosphorylation activity, and
COQ10 deficiency was confirmed by restoration of oxidative
phosphorylation activity after quinone addition. In the affected family
members, Mollet et al. (2007) identified a homozygous 1-bp deletion in
the COQ2 gene that resulted in a frameshift (609825.0002).
Transformation of yeast lacking Coq2 with human COQ2 containing the
mutation resulted in defective growth on respiratory medium.

Diomedi-Camassei et al. (2007) reported 2 patients with COQ10 deficiency
who had primarily renal involvement. The first patient presented with
steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome at the age of 18 months with no
extrarenal symptoms, and the second patient presented at 5 days of life
with oliguria and developed end-stage renal disease to which he
succumbed at 6 months of age after a course complicated by progressive
epileptic encephalopathy. Both patients carried 2 mutations in the COQ2
gene. The mutations (609825.0003, 609825.0004, and 609825.0005) were all
missense mutations occurring in residues highly conserved from yeast to
human.

- Susceptibility to Multiple System Atrophy 1

In affected members of 2 unrelated Japanese families with multiple
system atrophy-1 (MSA1; 146500), The Multiple-System Atrophy Research
Collaboration (2013) identified homozygous or compound heterozygous
mutations in the COQ2 gene (609825.0006-609825.0008). The mutations were
found in the first family by linkage analysis combined by whole-genome
sequencing. Subsequent sequencing of the COQ2 gene in 363 Japanese
patients with sporadic MSA and 2 sets of controls (520 individuals and
2,383 individuals) identified putative heterozygous or biallelic
pathogenic variants in 33 patients (see, e.g., 609825.0009). The most
common variant was V343A (609825.0007), which was also found in
heterozygous state in 17 Japanese controls. Statistical analysis in the
Japanese population yielded an odds ratio for disease development of
2.23 (p = 6.0 x 10(-5)) in COQ2 carriers. Rare pathogenic variants were
also found in 4 of 223 European patients with sporadic disease and in 1
of 172 North American patients with sporadic disease. None of 315
European controls carried a variant, but 1 of 294 North American
controls carried a variant. In vitro functional expression assays in
yeast Coq2-null strains demonstrated that the mutations caused variable
growth defects and variably low COQ2 activities in patient cell lines.
The findings suggested that mutations in the COQ2 gene may cause
susceptibility to the disorder. Patients with COQ2 mutations had
increased frequency of the cerebellar variant compared to the
parkinsonism variant. Four additional families with MSA, including a
German family reported by Wullner et al. (2009), did not have COQ2
mutations, indicating genetic heterogeneity.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
COENZYME Q10 DEFICIENCY, PRIMARY, 1
COQ2, TYR297CYS

In a boy, born of consanguineous parents, with infantile
encephalomyopathy, nephropathy, and primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency-1
(COQ10D1; 607426), originally reported by Salviati et al. (2005),
Quinzii et al. (2006) identified a homozygous 890A-G transition in the
COQ2 gene, changing a highly conserved tyrosine to cysteine at amino
acid 297 (Y297C) within a predicted transmembrane domain of the protein.
He had a deficiency of CoQ10 in muscle and fibroblasts (22% of
controls), and fibroblasts showed about 36% residual COQ2 enzymatic
activity. His younger sister, who had only proteinuria and coenzyme Q
deficiency in fibroblasts, carried the same homozygous mutation.

Lopez-Martin et al. (2007) showed that the Y297C-mutant protein could
not functionally complement Coq2-defective yeast. An equivalent mutation
introduced into the wildtype yeast Coq2 gene decreased CoQ10 levels and
impaired growth in respiratory-chain dependent medium, consistent with a
loss of function. Growth was restored by CoQ10 supplementation. The
CoQ10 deficiency was also found to impair de novo pyrimidine synthesis,
which may contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease.

Quinzii et al. (2010) studied fibroblasts carrying a homozygous Y297C
mutation. CoQ10 levels were decreased to 42.7% of normal, and the cells
showed decreased ATP synthesis and increased oxidative stress-induced
death. The results suggested that partial CoQ10 deficiency can cause
oxidative stress that is toxic to the cells.

.0002
COENZYME Q10 DEFICIENCY, PRIMARY, 1
COQ2, 1-BP DEL, 1198T

Mollet et al. (2007) reported a French family with coenzyme Q10
deficiency-1 (607426) in which a son and daughter died shortly after
birth due to anemia, liver failure, and renal insufficiency. The healthy
parents were from the same region and shared a patronymic but no known
ancestry. In 1 of the affected children, Mollet et al. (2007) identified
a homozygous 1-bp deletion (T) at nucleotide 1198 in exon 7 of the COQ2
gene, resulting in a premature stop codon. The parents were heterozygous
for the mutation, which was absent in controls.

.0003
COENZYME Q10 DEFICIENCY, PRIMARY, 1
COQ2, ARG197HIS

In a patient with coenzyme Q10 deficiency (607426) who presented with
steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome at age 18 months, Diomedi-Camassei
et al. (2007) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the
COQ2 gene: a 590G-A transition resulting in an arg197-to-his (R197H)
substitution on the maternal allele, and a 683A-G transition resulting
in an asn228-to-ser (N228S; 609825.0004) substitution on the paternal
allele. Neither mutation was found in 500 control chromosomes.

Quinzii et al. (2010) studied fibroblasts carrying the compound
heterozygous R197H/N228S mutations. CoQ10 levels were decreased to 36%
of normal, and the cells showed impaired respiratory-dependent growth
after 48 hours, decreased ATP levels, increased oxidative stress
markers, and increased cell death. The results suggested that partial
CoQ10 deficiency can cause both impaired bioenergetics and oxidative
stress that is toxic to the cells.

COENZYME Q10 DEFICIENCY, PRIMARY, 1
COQ2, ASN228SER

See 609825.0003 and Diomedi-Camassei et al. (2007).

.0005
COENZYME Q10 DEFICIENCY, PRIMARY, 1
COQ2, SER146ASN

In an Italian child with coenzyme Q10 deficiency-1 (607426),
Diomedi-Camassei et al. (2007) identified homozygosity for a 437G-A
transition in the COQ2 gene, resulting in a ser146-to-asn (S146N)
substitution. Both parents were shown to be carriers and the mutation
was not identified in 500 control chromosomes. The child presented with
severe renal disease in the newborn period characterized as severe
crescentic glomerulonephritis on biopsy at 10 days of age, developed
intractable seizures and end-stage renal disease, and died at 6 months
of age.

.0006
MULTIPLE SYSTEM ATROPHY 1, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
COQ2, MET78VAL

In 2 Japanese sibs, born of consanguineous parents, with multiple system
atrophy-1 (MSA1; 146500), originally reported by Hara et al. (2007), The
Multiple-System Atrophy Research Collaboration (2013) identified a
homozygous met78-to-val (M78V) substitution in the COQ2 gene. The
mutation, which was found by linkage analysis combined with whole-genome
sequencing, was not found in a large control database or in 360 control
Japanese alleles. Each sib also carried a homozygous val343-to-ala
(V343A; 609825.0007) substitution that was found in heterozygous state
in 5 of 360 control Japanese alleles. An unaffected sib did not carry
either variant, and family history indicated that the parents, each of
whom was an obligate carrier of both variants, showed no signs of the
disorder. In vitro functional expression assays in yeast Coq2-null
strains demonstrated that the M78V variant showed severely decreased
growth similar to the null strain. Patient cerebellar tissue from a
homozygous carrier showed severely decreased intracellular levels of
COQ2.

.0007
MULTIPLE SYSTEM ATROPHY 1, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
COQ2, VAL343ALA

The Multiple-System Atrophy Research Collaboration (2013) found that a
val343-to-ala (V343A) variant in the COQ2 gene was associated with
multiple system atrophy-1 (146500) in Japanese patients. V343A was
present in homozygous state with another pathogenic homozygous mutation
(M78V; 609825.0006) in 2 Japanese sibs with the disorder. It was also
found in compound heterozygosity with R337X (609825.0008) in 2
additional Japanese sibs from another family with the disorder. Among
363 Japanese patients with sporadic MSA1, homozygous V343A was found in
2 patients and none of 520 controls, and heterozygous V343A was found in
31 patients and 17 controls; 2 heterozygous carriers were compound
heterozygous with another potentially pathogenic COQ2 variant. The
allele frequency was 4.8% in Japanese patients and 1.6% in Japanese
controls (odds ratio (OR) for MSA1 of 3.05, p = 1.5 x 10(-4)).
Genotyping in a second series of 2,383 Japanese controls showed that the
V343A variant had an allele frequency of 2.2%, yielding an OR of 2.23 (p
= 6.0 x 10(-5)). Two patients with Alzheimer disease (AD; 104300) who
were found to carry a homozygous V343A mutation did not show any signs
of parkinsonism, cerebellar ataxia, or autonomic dysfunction. Otherwise,
the V343A variant appeared to be specific for MSA. V343A was not found
in 395 patients or 609 controls from European/North American cohorts. In
vitro functional expression assays in yeast Coq2-null strains showed
that the V343A variant could restore growth similar to wildtype, but
showed somewhat decreased COQ2 activities in cell lines derived from
patients with MSA.

.0008
MULTIPLE SYSTEM ATROPHY 1, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
COQ2, ARG337TER

In 2 Japanese sibs with MSA1 (146500), The Multiple-System Atrophy
Research Collaboration (2013) identified compound heterozygosity for 2
variants in the COQ2 gene: an arg337-to-ter (R337X) substitution, and
V343A (609825.0007). V343A was present in 5 of 360 control Japanese
alleles, but R337X was not found in controls. Their unaffected mother
was heterozygous for V343A and another unaffected sib was heterozygous
for R337X. In vitro functional expression assays in yeast Coq2-null
strains showed that the R337X variant resulted in severely impaired
growth similar to the null strain, and COQ2 activity levels in patient
cells was decreased compared to wildtype.

.0009
MULTIPLE SYSTEM ATROPHY 1, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
COQ2, ARG337GLN

In a Japanese patient with sporadic MSA1 (146500), The Multiple-System
Atrophy Research Collaboration (2013) identified compound heterozygosity
for 2 variants in the COQ2 gene: arg337-to-gln (R337Q) and V343A
(609825.0007). In vitro functional expression assays in yeast Coq2-null
strains showed that the R337Q variant resulted in severely impaired
growth similar to the null strain, and COQ2 activity levels in patient
cells was decreased compared to wildtype.

194558	TITLE *194558 ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 83; ZNF83
DESCRIPTION 
MAPPING

Marine et al. (1994) assigned the ZNF83 gene (also known as HPF1) to
chromosome 19 by screening a human/rodent hybrid panel and localized the
gene further to 19q13.3-q13.4 by fluorescence in situ hybridization and
digital imaging microscopy.

HISTORY

Conserved structural motifs define large families of nucleic acid
binding proteins in eukaryotes. The C2H2-type zinc finger motif,
conferring both specific RNA and DNA binding activities, was first
detected within the amino acid sequence of the Xenopus transcription
factor IIIA (Miller et al., 1985). Thereafter, vertebrate genomes were
shown to encode hundreds of so-called zinc finger proteins (ZFPs).
Subfamilies were defined on the basis of conserved sequence elements
outside the finger repeat, such as the KRAB domain. Several members of
these subfamilies were found to have a clustered genomic organization.

CELL CYCLE PROGRESSION RESTORATION 2; CPR2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By screening a hepatoma cDNA expression library for clones that could
block mating pheromone-induced G1 arrest in yeast, Edwards et al. (1997)
cloned TBRG4, which they called CPR2. The deduced protein contains
multiple putative leucine zipper domains characteristic of transcription
factors.

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated human brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1999) cloned TBRG4, which they designated
KIAA0948. The transcript contains several repetitive elements in the
3-prime untranslated region. The deduced 521-amino acid protein shares
significant similarity with rat Cpr2. RT-PCR ELISA detected moderate
expression in ovary, and little to no expression in all other tissues
and specific brain regions examined.

MAPPING

By FISH, Edwards et al. (1997) mapped the TBRG4 gene to chromosome
7p14-p13.

C7ORF21
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Ubiquitin-like proteins (ULP) share 15 to 60% identity with ubiquitin at
the amino acid level and are involved in cell cycle progression, DNA
repair, apoptosis, endocytosis of membrane receptors, and cellular
protein location. DULP, a widely expressed protein derived from
dendritic cells, shares 26% identity with ubiquitin (see UBA52, 191321
and UBA80, 191343) (Liu et al., 2009).

CLONING

By random sequencing of a dendritic cell cDNA library, Liu et al. (2009)
isolated a 1,322-bp cDNA with a single open reading frame (ORF) of 738
bp and encoding a 246-amino acid protein that they designated DULP.
Residues 103 to 176 of DULP have homology to UBA80, including to the
essential ile44 hydrophobic patch and the lys6 involved in the formation
of a multiubiquitin chain that binds to the proteasome subunit RPN10
(PSMD4; 601648). However, val-gly substituted for the conserved
diglycine motif, required for conjugation formation by ULPs. RT-PCR
analysis detected wide expression in many, but not all, cancer cell
lines. Western blot analysis showed expression of a 28-kD myc
(190080)-tagged protein. Immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated
expression strong in the nucleus and weaker in the cytosol. Transient
expression of DULP resulted in apoptosis that was not mediated through
the proteasome or mitochondria. Liu et al. (2009) concluded that DULP is
a novel ubiquitin-like protein expressed in dendritic cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Liu et al. (2009) determined that the DULP gene comprises 2 exons.

MAPPING

By database analysis, Liu et al. (2009) mapped the TMUB1 (DULP) gene to
chromosome 7q36.1.

300658	TITLE *300658 NDP GENE; NDP
;;NORRIN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The NDP gene encodes norrin, a secreted cysteine-rich protein that
belongs to the cystine knot growth factor family (Meindl et al., 1992).

CLONING

By positional cloning, Berger et al. (1992) and Chen et al. (1992)
isolated a likely candidate gene for the site of mutation in Norrie
disease (ND; 310600). The gene was found to be expressed in retina,
choroid, and fetal brain by Berger et al. (1992) and in fetal and adult
brain by Chen et al. (1992). It was evolutionarily conserved and encoded
a predicted protein of 133 amino acids. The genomic equivalent of the
cDNA spanned a maximum of 50 kb (Chen et al., 1992) and was partly
deleted in several typical Norrie disease patients.

By studying the number and spacing of cysteine residues, Meindl et al.
(1992) detected homologies between the NDP gene product and a C-terminal
domain that is common to a group of proteins including mucins.

Chen et al. (1993) found that expression of the NDP gene is not confined
to the eye or to the brain. They found homology with cysteine-rich
protein-binding domains of intermediate-early genes implicated in the
regulation of cell proliferation. This led them to propose that the NDP
molecule likewise may be involved in the pathway that regulates neural
cell differentiation and proliferation.

Meitinger et al. (1993) reported that sequence pattern searches and
3-dimensional modeling suggested that the NDP protein has a tertiary
structure similar to that of transforming growth factor-beta (see TGFB1,
190180). The model identified NDP as a member of an emerging family of
growth factors containing a cystine knot motif, with direct implications
for the physiologic role of NDP.

Berger et al. (1996) cloned the mouse Ndp gene, which encodes a
polypeptide that shares 94% sequence identity with the human protein.
RNA in situ hybridization revealed expression in retina, brain, and
olfactory bulb and epithelium of 2-week-old mice.

GENE STRUCTURE

Meindl et al. (1992) found that only exons 2 and 3 of the NDP gene are
translated. Exon 2 contains the first 58 codons of the open reading
frame. The intron that follows it is roughly 14.5 kb. Exon 3 is the
largest exon and contains residues 59-133 of the open reading frame and
a 917-bp 3-prime untranslated region.

Chen et al. (1993) determined that the NDP gene spans 28 kb and contains
3 exons, the first of which is entirely contained within the 5-prime
untranslated region.

MAPPING

Sims et al. (1992) narrowed the mapping of the NDP gene to a 150-kb
region on chromosome Xp defined by a recombination and by the smallest
submicroscopic chromosomal deletion associated with Norrie disease. They
concluded that the order of loci was: pter--DXS7--MAOA--MAOB--NDP--cen.

Berger et al. (1996) mapped the mouse Ndp gene to the X chromosome.

GENE FUNCTION

In studies in COS-7 cells, Perez-Vilar and Hill (1997) found that norrin
was present only in cell lysates and the extracellular matrix. Further
analysis showed that most of the norrin in the extracellular matrix
formed cross-linked disulfide-bonded oligomers that contained up to 20
monomers.

By in situ hybridization of NDP mRNA, Hartzer et al. (1999) found
abundant signals in the outer nuclear, inner nuclear, and ganglion cell
layers of the retina in all 3 species (mouse, rabbit, and human)
examined. There was no significant expression in the vitreous humor,
lens, or rod outer segment. High expression levels were also observed in
the cerebellar granular layer, hippocampus, olfactory bulb, cortex, and
epithelium of the rabbit brain. These data suggested that the NDP gene
could play a critical role in the differentiation or maintenance of the
differentiated state of the retina.

Incomplete retinal vascularization occurs in both Norrie disease and
familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (FEVR). One form of FEVR (EVR1;
133780) is caused by defects in frizzled-4 (FZD4; 604579), a presumptive
Wnt receptor. Xu et al. (2004) determined that norrin and FZD4 function
as a ligand-receptor pair based on the similarity in vascular phenotypes
caused by norrin and FZD4 mutations in humans and mice; the specificity
and high affinity of norrin-FZD4 binding; the high efficiency with which
norrin induces FZD4- and LRP (see 107770)-dependent activation of the
classic Wnt pathway; and the signaling defects displayed by
disease-associated variants of norrin and FZD4. These data defined a
norrin-FZD4 signaling system that plays a central role in vascular
development in the eye and ear, and they indicated that ligands
unrelated to Wnts can act through frizzled receptors.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Norrie Disease

Berger et al. (1992) identified small deletions in the NDP gene in
several patients with Norrie disease. In 12 of 17 unrelated patients
with Norrie disease, Berger et al. (1992) identified 11 different
mutations in the NDP gene (see, e.g., 300658.0001-300658.0002). Most of
the mutations were located in exon 3.

In 3 unrelated patients with Norrie disease, Meindl et al. (1992)
identified 3 missense mutations in the NDP gene
(300658.0003-300658.0005). All 3 mutations replaced evolutionarily
conserved cysteines or created new cysteine codons, emphasizing the
functional importance of these sites. These findings and the clinical
features of Norrie disease suggested a possible role for the NDP gene in
a neuroectodermal cell-cell interaction.

- Familial Exudative Vitreoretinopathy

Shastry et al. (1997) reported 4 novel missense mutations in the NDP
gene associated with 1 X-linked and 4 sporadic cases of familial
exudative vitreoretinopathy (EVR2; 305390) (see 300658.0013).

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

Among 109 patients with pediatric vitreoretinopathies, Wu et al. (2007)
identified 11 with a mutation in the NDP gene. They found that NDP
mutations disrupting the cysteine-knot motif corresponded to severe
retinal dysgenesis and a diagnosis of Norrie disease, whereas patients
with noncysteine mutations had varying degrees of avascular peripheral
retina, extraretinal vasculature, and subretinal exudate.

Kondo et al. (2007) screened 62 FEVR and 3 ND Japanese probands and
family members for mutations in the NDP gene and identified 5 different
mutations (1 splicing and 4 missense) in 4 FEVR patients and 2 ND
patients. One proband with a missense mutation in the signal sequence of
NDP had significant phenotypic heterogeneity between the affected eyes,
indicating a diagnosis of FEVR or ND. The proband with a splicing
mutation had typical features of ND, whereas a maternal nephew had a
diagnosis of FEVR.

Using a norrin-based reporter assay to analyze the effects of
FEVR-causing mutations, Qin et al. (2008) demonstrated that a nonsense
mutation in FZD4 completely abolished signaling activity, whereas
missense mutations in FZD4 and LRP5 caused a moderate level of
reduction, and a double missense mutation in both genes caused a severe
reduction in activity, correlating roughly with clinical phenotypes.
Norrin mutants, however, showed variable effects on signal transduction,
and no correlation with clinical phenotypes was observed; norrin mutants
also showed impaired cell surface binding. Qin et al. (2008) concluded
that norrin signaling is involved in FEVR pathogenesis, but suggested
the presence of an unknown parallel pathway at the level of
receptor/ligand binding as evidenced by the moderate and variable signal
reduction lacking a clear genotype/phenotype correlation.

ANIMAL MODEL

Berger et al. (1996) used gene targeting technology to generate Ndp
mutant mice. Hemizygous mice carrying a replacement mutation in exon 2
of the Ndp gene developed retrolental structures in the vitreous body
and showed an overall disorganization of the retinal ganglion cell
layer. The outer plexiform layer disappeared occasionally, resulting in
a juxtaposed inner and outer nuclear layer. The ocular findings were
consistent with observations in patients with Norrie disease.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
NORRIE DISEASE
NDP, ARG90PRO

In a patient with Norrie disease (310600), Berger et al. (1992)
identified a 685G-C transversion in exon 3 of the NDP gene, resulting in
an arg90-to-pro (R90P) substitution. The patient had no hearing
impairment or mental disturbances, but had a family history of the
disorder.

.0002
NORRIE DISEASE
NDP, SER75CYS

In a patient with Norrie disease (310600), Berger et al. (1992)
identified a 640C-G transversion in exon 3 of the NDP gene, resulting in
a ser75-to-cys (S75C) substitution.

.0003
NORRIE DISEASE
NDP, VAL60GLU

In a patient with Norrie disease (310600), Meindl et al. (1992)
identified a 595T-A in the NDP gene, resulting in a val60-to-glu (V60E)
substitution, inherited from the mother.

.0004
NORRIE DISEASE
NDP, TYR44CYS

In a patient with Norrie disease (310600), Meindl et al. (1992)
identified a 547A-G transition in the NDP gene, resulting in a
tyr44-to-cys (Y44C) substitution.

.0005
NORRIE DISEASE
NDP, CYS96TYR

In a patient with Norrie disease (310600), Meindl et al. (1992)
identified a 703G-A transition in the NDP gene, resulting in a
cys96-to-tyr (C96Y) substitution.

.0006
EXUDATIVE VITREORETINOPATHY 2, X-LINKED
NDP, LEU124PHE

In a family with X-linked exudative vitreoretinopathy (EVR2; 305390)
manifested by members of 4 generations (Dudgeon, 1979) and found to have
possible linkage to markers in the region of the Norrie disease locus
(Fullwood et al., 1993), Chen et al. (1993) demonstrated a C-to-T
transition in the NDP gene, resulting in a leu124-to-phe (L124F)
substitution in the highly conserved region of the NDP gene. The
mutation was absent in unaffected family members and in normal controls.

.0007
NORRIE DISEASE
NDP, CYS69SER

In a family with a manifesting female carrier of Norrie disease
(310600), Chen et al. (1993) identified a 614G-C transversion in the NDP
gene, resulting in a cys69-to-ser (C69S) substitution. The carrier
female had been noted to have severely impaired vision at age 2.
Examination revealed a cataract in the right eye and total retinal
detachment with a vascularized mass behind the lens. In the left eye, a
retinal fold and traction retinal detachment in the temporal periphery
were evident. The child was otherwise normal. Her carrier mother was
normal. Two of the mother's brothers had Norrie disease.

.0008
NORRIE DISEASE
NDP, CYS128TER

In a patient with Norrie disease (310600), Wong et al. (1993) identified
a dinucleotide GC-to-AA change in the NDP gene, resulting in a
cys128-to-ter (C128X) substitution. The mutant protein lacked the last 6
amino acids of the carboxyl terminus. Wong et al. (1993) pointed out
that the NDP protein normally has 11 cysteines, that the codon 128
mutation involved the tenth cysteine, and that most reported mutations
have involved this amino acid residue.

.0009
NORRIE DISEASE
NDP, MET1VAL

In 2 Japanese males with Norrie disease (310600) from apparently
unrelated families, Isashiki et al. (1995) identified an A-to-G
transition at the initiation codon of exon 2 of the NDP gene, resulting
in a met1-to-val (M1V) substitution. Both mothers were heterozygous for
the mutation. Neither patient showed mental retardation or hearing
impairment. Although the 2 families had lived in the same prefecture in
southwestern Japan for at least 2 centuries, no relationship between the
2 families could be identified. All previously identified mutations had
occurred in single families, indicating a marked heterogeneity of
mutations. The finding of the same mutation in 2 apparently unrelated
families, taken with the rarity of the disease, suggested that they
shared a common ancestor.

.0010
EXUDATIVE VITREORETINOPATHY 2, X-LINKED
NDP, ARG121TRP

In a 29-year-old male patient with X-linked exudative vitreoretinopathy
(EVR2; 305390), Fuchs et al. (1995) found an arg121-to-trp (R121W)
mutation in the NDP gene. Low visual acuity had been noted since birth.
When the patient was 3 years old, the right eye was enucleated because
an intraocular tumor was suspected. Histologic examination showed severe
intraocular inflammation without malignancy. Visual acuity in the left
eye remained unchanged until adulthood. The retina showed severe
temporal dragging of the vessels, including the macula. Severely reduced
visual acuity was known in several maternal male relatives; the mother
and maternal grandmother had normal visual acuity.

Shastry et al. (1995) identified the same mutation in affected members
in 3 generations of a family segregating X-linked exudative
vitreoretinopathy.

Shastry (1998) identified the R121W mutation in a 'simplex' case of
exudative vitreoretinopathy.

A different substitution at the same codon (R121L) has been described
(300658.0017).

.0011
NORRIE DISEASE
NDP, LEU13ARG

In affected members of a large Cuban kindred with Norrie disease
(310600), Fuchs et al. (1994) identified a 454T-G transversion in the
NDP gene, resulting in a leu13-to-arg (L13R) substitution. The
nucleotide substitution creates a new HhaI restriction site. This
mutation was identified in a large Cuban pedigree which consisted of 380
members, 46 of whom were affected. The disorder showed a typical pattern
of X-linked inheritance over 7 generations. Eighteen patients examined
shared similar clinical features. Pseudoglioma was always present in
both eyes, frequently with phthisis bulbi, enophthalmos, opaque cornea,
and cataract. In addition, about 45% of the patients showed moderate or
severe mental retardation. Hearing loss was recognized in 78% of the
patients, with different ages of onset.

.0012
NORRIE DISEASE
NDP, LEU61PHE

Rehm et al. (1997) identified a large Costa Rican kindred in which 15
males were afflicted with congenital blindness, progressive hearing
loss, and venous insufficiency. Because of an X-linked pattern of
inheritance and the ophthalmologic and otologic findings, including
bilateral retinal dysplasia and detachment and progressive bilateral
sensorineural hearing loss, a tentative diagnosis of Norrie disease
(310600) was considered. However, venous insufficiency was a clinical
finding apparently not previously recognized in association with Norrie
disease. Linkage analysis using microsatellite repeat markers
demonstrated linkage to the Norrie disease region and studies of the NDP
gene showed a point mutation in the third exon resulting in an
leu61-to-phe (L61F) substitution. No obligate carrier females had any
ocular or relevant pathology, but all affected males had varicose veins
with peripheral venous stasis ulcers. Phlebography and other radiologic
examinations showed deep venous system insufficiency and moderate
dilatation of veins. Transfemoral arteriography showed patency of the
femoral and distal arterial system.

.0013
EXUDATIVE VITREORETINOPATHY, X-LINKED
NDP, HIS42ARG

Shastry et al. (1997) found an H42R mutation of the NDP gene segregating
with exudative vitreoretinopathy (305390) in 3 generations of a family.
They also identified mutations in the NDP gene in 4 sporadic cases of
FEVR.

.0014
NORRIE DISEASE
NDP, 1-BP DEL

In a boy with Norrie disease (310600), Chynn et al. (1996) identified a
1-bp deletion in codon 35 of the NDP gene. The deletion changed the
amino acids encoded by codons 35 through 39 and resulted in a premature
stop at codon 40. The unaffected mother was heterozygous for the
mutation.

.0015
NORRIE DISEASE
NDP, ALA105THR

In an Italian family in which 5 males in 4 generations had
characteristic ophthalmologic findings of Norrie disease (310600),
Torrente et al. (1997) identified an ala105-to-thr (A105T) missense
mutation in the NDP gene. Affected individuals had no mental retardation
or hearing abnormality.

.0016
EXUDATIVE VITREORETINOPATHY 2, X-LINKED
NDP, CYS110GLY

In an Italian family with exudative vitreoretinopathy (EVR2; 305390) in
an X-linked pedigree pattern, Torrente et al. (1997) demonstrated a
cys110-to-gly (C110G) mutation in the NDP gene.

.0017
EXUDATIVE VITREORETINOPATHY 2, X-LINKED
NDP, ARG121LEU

In a large kindred with X-linked recessive exudative vitreoretinopathy
(EVR2; 305390), Johnson et al. (1996) identified an arg121-to-leu
(R121L) mutation in the NDP gene. The clinical phenotype and rate of
disease progression were extremely variable, with progression to total
retinal detachment occurring before the age of 2 years in some and later
than 21 years in others. Johnson et al. (1996) pointed out that all
mutations identified in X-linked vitreoretinopathy have been missense
mutations, presumably not affecting the 3-dimensional structure of the
NDP gene product. Note that the same codon is involved in the
arg121-to-trp mutation (300658.0010). Johnson et al. (1996) suggested
that the mutations causing X-linked vitreoretinopathy cluster around
residues 121-126, but this is not entirely true, as indicated by the
cys110-to-gly mutation (300658.0016) and the his42-to-arg mutation
(300658.0013).

.0018
NORRIE DISEASE
NDP, CYS96TRP

Black et al. (1999) reported a woman with a unilateral variant of Coats
disease (300216) who gave birth to a son affected by Norrie disease
(310600). Both carried a 704C-G transversion in the NDP gene, resulting
in a cys96-to-trp (C96W) substitution. Subsequent analysis of the
retinas of 9 enucleated eyes from males with Coats disease demonstrated
a somatic C96W mutation in the NDP gene in 1 that was not present in
nonretinal tissue. Black et al. (1999) suggested that Coats
telangiectasis is secondary to somatic mutation in the NDP gene, which
results in a deficiency of norrin within the developing retina. This
supported observations that the protein is critical for normal retinal
vasculogenesis. The authors noted that a cys96-to-tyr substitution
(300658.0005) had previously been described.

.0019
NORRIE DISEASE
NDP, VAL45GLU

In a boy with Norrie disease (310600), Lev et al. (2007) identified a
134T-A transversion in the NDP gene, resulting in a val45-to-glu (V45E)
substitution. He had profound mental retardation and myoclonic seizures
with hypsarrhythmia on EEG. His asymptomatic mother was heterozygous for
the mutation. Bioinformatic analysis indicated that V45E lies within an
extracellular localization motif and may alter the distribution pattern
of norrin, which in turn may alter norrin-mediated cell-cell
communication.

.0020
NORRIE DISEASE
NDP, SER73TER

In affected male members of a family with Norrie disease (310600),
Walker et al. (1997) identified a 626C-A transversion in exon 3 of the
NDP gene, resulting in a ser73-to-ter (S73X) substitution. Affected
members had a severe ocular phenotype, but no mental retardation or
deafness.

.0021
NORRIE DISEASE
NDP, SER101PHE

In affected male members of a family with Norrie disease (310600),
Walker et al. (1997) identified a 710C-T transition in exon 3 of the NDP
gene, resulting in a ser101-to-phe (S101F) substitution. Affected
members had a less severe ocular phenotype compared to other patients
with Norrie disease and no mental retardation or deafness.

;;CENTROSOMAL COLON CANCER AUTOANTIGEN PROTEIN; CCCAP;;
NY-CO-8;;
SLSN7 GENE;;
NPHP10 GENE
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Kenedy et al. (2003) cloned an SDCCAG8 cDNA, which they called CCCAP
(centrosomal colon cancer autoantigen protein), from a human placenta
cDNA library. By sequence analysis they discovered that a fragment of
CCCAP had been identified as colon cancer autoantigen NY-CO-8 by Scanlan
et al. (1998). Kenedy et al. (2003) found at least 3 alternatively
spliced CCCAP transcripts, including a full-length transcript encoding a
deduced 713-amino acid protein with a molecular mass of 82.5 kD. Kenedy
et al. (2003) cloned the mouse CCCAP cDNA from a spleen cDNA library.
The human and mouse proteins share 71% identity and have the same
predicted secondary structure consisting of a predicted N-terminal
globular domain and a C-terminal coiled-coil domain. Human and mouse
CCCAP transcripts were found to be ubiquitously expressed but at very
low copy number (Kenedy et al., 2003). Endogenous mouse BALB/c 3T3
fibroblasts and ectopic human CCCAP in U2-osteosarcoma cells localized
to centrosomes during interphase and mitosis.

Otto et al. (2010) determined that the SDCCAG8 gene comprises 18 exons.

MAPPING

Kenedy et al. (2003) stated that the CCCAP gene maps to chromosome
1q43-q44.

GENE FUNCTION

Based on the centrosomal localization of human and mouse CCCAP and the
ability of mouse CCCAP to homo-oligomerize, Kenedy et al. (2003)
suggested that CCCAP is a stable centrosomal component with a structural
role in the centrosomal architecture or the microtubule organizing
activities of the centrosome matrix.

In a mammalian renal epithelial cell line, Otto et al. (2010) found that
Sdccag8 localizes to centrosomes, but at a distance from centrioles and
from distal centrosomal appendages. There was colocalization with ninein
(608684), a marker of centrosomal appendages, and with NPHP5 (609237)
and OFD1 (300170). Sdccag8 also localized to cell-cell junctions.
Further cellular studies led Otto et al. (2010) to conclude that SDCCAG8
is located at the distal ends of both centrioles and that it colocalizes
to centrosomes throughout the cell cycle. Human SDCCAG8 was also found
in human retinal pigment epithelial cells, where it localized in the
vicinity of centrosomes. Yeast 2-hybrid screening studies showed that
SDCCAG8 interacts directly with OFD1, and studies in mouse photoreceptor
cells showed that Sdccag8 colocalized with Nphp5 in the transition zone.

Chaki et al. (2012) found that NPHP10 colocalized with the DNA damage
response proteins TIP60 (KAT5; 601409), SC35 (SRSF2; 600813), CEP164
(614848), and ZNF423 (604557) at nuclear foci in immortalized human
retinal pigment epithelial cells. This noncentrosomal localization of
NPHP10 suggested a role for this protein in DNA damage repair. Chaki et
al. (2012) suggested that defects in DNA repair may play a role in
nephronophthisis-related ciliopathies, such as Senior-Loken syndrome
(SLSN7; 613615).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Otto et al. (2010) used homozygosity mapping followed by exon capture
and massively parallel sequencing to identify a homozygous truncating
mutation in the SDCCAG8 gene (613524.0001) in 2 sibs with Senior-Loken
syndrome 7 (SLSN7; 613615), who were born of consanguineous parents from
Reunion Island. Both patients had biopsy-confirmed nephronophthisis and
retinal degeneration, leading to blindness in 1. Analysis of additional
families found 11 different truncating mutations (see, e.g.,
613524.0002-613524.0005) in 9 families with SLSN. Some of the families
had additional features, such as obesity and mild mental retardation,
that were suggestive of the ciliopathy Bardet-Biedl syndrome (209900);
however, none of the patients had polydactyly. Recessive SDCCAG8
mutations accounted for 3.3% (6 of 182) cases from a worldwide SLSN
cohort.

ANIMAL MODEL

Otto et al. (2010) demonstrated that knockout of the Sdccag8 gene in
zebrafish resulted in multiple developmental defects, including abnormal
body axis curvature, shortened and broadened tails, kidney cysts at 72
hours post fertilization, and hydrocephalus. Knockdown of murine Sdccag8
in renal epithelial cells resulted in the formation of spheroids with
architectural defects characterized by disturbed localization of
beta-catenin (CTNNB1; 116806) at the basolateral membrane, fewer tight
junctions, and an irregular lumen. These findings were consistent with a
defect in cell polarity and lumen formation, which may reflect the renal
tubular defects found in individuals with a congenital SDCCAG8 mutation.
Increased intracellular cAMP caused a dose-dependent loss of Sdccag8
from cell-cell junctions compared to controls.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
SENIOR-LOKEN SYNDROME 7
SDCCAG8, 1-BP DEL, 1420G

In 2 sibs with Senior-Loken syndrome 7 (SLSN7; 613615), born of
consanguineous parents from Reunion Island, Otto et al. (2010)
identified a homozygous 1-bp deletion (1420delG) in exon 12 of the
SDCCAG8 gene, resulting in frameshift and premature termination
(Glu474fsTer493). The mutation was found by homozygosity mapping
followed by exon capture and massively parallel sequencing. One patient
had onset of nephronophthisis at age 4 years and retinal degeneration at
age 14 years, whereas the other was blind by age 7 years and had onset
of renal disease at age 14 years. The mutation was not found in 270
control individuals.

.0002
SENIOR-LOKEN SYNDROME 7
SDCCAG8, 1-BP INS, 1339G

In 2 affected members of a consanguineous Algerian family with SLSN7
(613615), Otto et al. (2010) identified a homozygous 1-bp insertion
(1339insG) in exon 11 of the SDCCAG8 gene, resulting in frameshift and
premature termination (Glu447fsTer463). Onset of nephronophthisis
occurred at ages 7 and 4 years, respectively, and flat
electroretinograms were observed at ages 13 and 6 years, respectively.
One of the patients had mild mental retardation. The mutation was not
found in 270 control individuals.

.0003
SENIOR-LOKEN SYNDROME 7
SDCCAG8, 4-BP DEL, 1946GTGT

By direct exon sequencing of 118 families with Senior-Loken syndrome,
Otto et al. (2010) found a homozygous truncating mutation in the SDCCAG8
gene in 1 family, consistent with SLSN7 (613615). The mutation was a
4-bp deletion (1946delGTGT) in exon 16, resulting in frameshift and
premature termination (Cys649fsTer658). The patient had retinal
degeneration, and nephronophthisis was confirmed by renal biopsy at age
22 years. The mutation was not found in 270 control individuals.

.0004
SENIOR-LOKEN SYNDROME 7
SDCCAG8, IVS7, C-T

In 4 affected members of a consanguineous Gypsy family with SLSN7
(613615), Otto et al. (2010) identified a homozygous deep intronic
mutation (c.740+356C-T) in intron 7 of the SDCCAG8 gene, predicted to
cause loss of an exonic splice enhancer site, with the result of
aberrant splicing introducing an in-frame stop codon. RT-PCR and
immunoblotting studies showed almost complete absence of the full-length
product. All patients had NPHP and retinal degeneration, as well as some
features of Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS; 209900), such as mild mental
retardation and obesity, although none had polydactyly. One of the
patients had relatively late onset of renal and retinal disease in the
twenties, which may have been due to some residual protein function. The
mutation was not found in 270 control individuals.

.0005
SENIOR-LOKEN SYNDROME 7
SDCCAG8, LYS227TER

In 2 affected members of a consanguineous family with SLSN7 (613615),
Otto et al. (2010) identified a homozygous 679A-T transversion in exon 7
of the SDCCAG8 gene, resulting in a lys227-to-ter (K227X) substitution.
Both individuals had NPHP and retinal degeneration, as well as some
features of Bardet-Biedl syndrome (209900), such as mild mental
retardation, obesity, and hypogenitalism, although neither had
polydactyly. The mutation was not found in 270 control individuals.

604769	TITLE *604769 PEROXIREDOXIN 3; PRDX3
;;PRX3;;
ANTIOXIDANT PROTEIN 1; AOP1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Peroxiredoxins inactivate H2O2 by oxidizing a key cysteine residue in
their catalytic center, which is subsequently reduced by thioredoxins
(see 187700). The thioredoxins are subsequently reduced by electrons
from NADPH via thioredoxin reductases (see TXNRD1; 601112). PRDX3 is
localized exclusively in mitochondria (summary by Chiribau et al.,
2008).

CLONING

The mouse Aop1 protein, also called Mer5, may promote early events in
the differentiation of murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells (Nemoto et
al., 1990). Tsuji et al. (1995) found that mouse Aop1 shares 38% amino
acid sequence identity with the C22 subunit of Salmonella typhimurium
alkylhydroperoxide reductase.

By screening a human leukemia cell line cDNA library with a mouse Aop1
cDNA, Tsuji et al. (1995) isolated a cDNA encoding human AOP1. The
deduced 256-amino acid human AOP1 protein shares 86% amino acid sequence
similarity with mouse Aop1, and significant similarity with both the
human proliferation-associated gene A product (PAGA; 176763) and the
mouse stress-induced peritoneal macrophage protein Msp23. AOP1 also
shows sequence similarity to the S. cerevisiae thiol-specific
antioxidant protein TSA; a surface antigen of Entamoeba histolytica,
which is a pathogenic protozoan that causes diarrhea and organ abscess
formation; and a protein of H. pylori, which is a causative agent in
gastritis, ulcers, and gastric adenocarcinoma.

GENE FUNCTION

Tsuji et al. (1995) demonstrated that recombinant mouse Aop1 could
complement an alkylhydroperoxide reductase mutation in E. coli,
suggesting that Aop1 functions as an antioxidant protein.

Shih et al. (2001) determined that AOP1 interacts with Abrin A-chain
(ABRA), which inhibits protein synthesis and can induce apoptosis. By
immunolocalization studies, they determined that both AOP1 and ABRA
colocalize within the mitochondria. By assays of thiol-dependent
antioxidant activity, they determined that ABRA can attenuate AOP1
activity in a dose-dependent manner. Ectopic expression of AOP1 also
blocked the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria and inhibited
apoptosis in ABRA-treated cells.

Deregulated expression of the MYC transcription factor (190080) is found
in a wide variety of human tumors. The primary transforming activity of
MYC is thought to arise through transcriptional regulation of numerous
target genes. Wonsey et al. (2002) showed that PRDX3, which encodes a
mitochondrial protein of the peroxiredoxin gene family, is such a
target. Expression of PRDX3 is induced by MYC and is reduced in c-myc
-/- cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis spanning the entire
PRDX3 genomic sequence revealed that MYC binds preferentially to a
930-bp region surrounding exon 1. Wonsey et al. (2002) showed that PRDX3
is required for MYC-mediated proliferation, transformation, and
apoptosis after glucose withdrawal. Results using mitochondria-specific
fluorescent probes demonstrated that PRDX3 is essential for maintaining
mitochondrial mass and membrane potential in transformed rat and human
cells. These data provided evidence that PRDX3 is a MYC target gene that
is required to maintain normal mitochondrial function.

Chiribau et al. (2008) found that the forkhead box transcription factor
FOXO3A (602681) was required for basal expression of PRX3 in human
cardiac fibroblasts. They identified 2 FOXO regulatory sequences in the
promoter region of PRX3 and showed that binding of FOXO3A to both
regulatory sequences was required for FOXO3A-mediated activation of a
PRX3 reporter plasmid. Chiribau et al. (2008) concluded that FOXO3A
mediates PRX3 expression and suggested that this regulation may play a
critical role in the resistance to oxidative stress in cardiac
fibroblasts.

MAPPING

By FISH, Tsuji et al. (1995) mapped the human AOP1 gene, also known as
PRDX3, to 10q25-q26. They mapped the mouse Aop1 gene to the distal
region of chromosome 19.

607581	TITLE *607581 SOLUTE CARRIER FAMILY 22 (ORGANIC ANION TRANSPORTER), MEMBER 8; SLC22A8
;;ORGANIC ANION TRANSPORTER 3; OAT3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using homology with rat Oat1 (SLC22A6; 607582), Race et al. (1999)
identified ESTs for SLC22A8, which they designated OAT3. They obtained
the full-length clone from a kidney cDNA library. The deduced 568-amino
acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 62.1 kD. SLC22A8
contains 12 transmembrane-spanning domains that are separated by 5
intracellular loops and 6 extracellular loops, and the N and C termini
are intracellular. It also has 3 motifs conserved in the amphiphilic
solute facilitator family of proteins. SLC22A8 shares 42 to 43% amino
acid similarity with human, mouse, and rat OAT1 and 25% similarity with
the organic cation transporters OCT1 (SLC22A1; 602607) and OCT2
(SLC22A2; 602608). Northern blot analysis revealed strong expression of
a 3.0-kb transcript in kidney, with weaker expression in brain.

By screening liver and kidney cDNA libraries for homology with rat Oat1,
Sun et al. (2001) cloned what they considered to be a splice variant of
the OAT3 sequence reported by Race et al. (1999). The deduced protein
contains 542 amino acids. Northern blot analysis detected expression of
a major 2.6-kb OAT3 transcript and a minor 4.5-kb OAT3 transcript only
in kidney.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the SLC22A8
gene to chromosome 11 (TMAP WI-14966).

300550	TITLE *300550 PHOSPHATE-REGULATING ENDOPEPTIDASE HOMOLOG, X-LINKED; PHEX
;;PEX
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The HYP Consortium (1995), comprising 29 investigators in 5
institutions, isolated a candidate gene for X-linked hypophosphatemic
rickets (307800) from the Xp22.1 region by positional cloning. The gene
exhibited homology to a family of endopeptidase genes, members of which
are involved in the degradation or activation of a variety of peptide
hormones, including neutral endopeptidase (NEP; 120520),
endothelin-converting enzyme (ECE1; 600423), and Kell blood group
antigen (613883). Because of the homology and the function of the gene,
the authors referred to it as PEX ('phosphate regulating gene with
homologies to endopeptidases, on the X chromosome'). A partial PHEX
sequence corresponding to 638 amino acids was presented. The PHEX cDNA
was found to be evolutionarily conserved in primate, bovine, mouse, and
hamster DNA, and possibly in chicken DNA.

Guo and Quarles (1997) isolated a human PHEX cDNA from a bone cDNA
library. The deduced 749-amino acid protein has a molecular mass of 86.5
kD and shares 96% identity to the mouse sequence. The PHEX protein is
predicted to have a 20-residue N-terminal cytoplasmic tail, a 27-residue
transmembrane domain, and a 702-residue extracellular C-terminal region.
The protein belongs to the type II integral membrane zinc-dependent
endopeptidase family. PHEX transcripts were identified in human
osteosarcoma-derived cells and in differentiated mouse osteoblasts, but
not in immature mouse preosteoblasts, indicating stage-specific
expression. Guo and Quarles (1997) suggested that PHEX may play a role
in osteoblast-mediated bone mineralization.

Grieff et al. (1997) isolated human PHEX clones from an ovary cDNA
library. The gene encodes a 749-amino acid polypeptide that is 96%
identical to the murine Phex gene product and has significant homology
to other members of the membrane-bound zinc metallopeptidase family.
Northern blot analysis identified a 6.6-kb PHEX mRNA transcript at high
levels in adult ovary and fetal lung and at lower levels in adult lung
and fetal liver.

Du et al. (1996) reported the isolation and characterization of the
complete open reading frame of the mouse Phex gene. The deduced
749-amino acid protein showed 95% identity to the available human PHEX
sequence and significant homology to members of the membrane-bound
metalloendopeptidase family. Northern blot analysis revealed a 6.6-kb
mRNA transcript in bone and in cultured osteoblasts from normal mice;
the transcript was not detectable in samples from the mutant 'Hyp' mouse
but were detectable in Hyp bone by RT-PCR amplification. Beck et al.
(1997) cloned mouse Phex and human PHEX cDNAs encoding part of the
5-prime untranslated region, the protein coding region, and the entire
3-prime untranslated region. Using RT-PCR and ribonuclease protection
assays, they found that Phex/PHEX mRNA is expressed predominantly in
human fetal and in adult mouse calvaria and long bone.

GENE STRUCTURE

Holm et al. (1997) determined that the PHEX gene contains 18 exons. Its
genomic organization shares similarity with members of the family of
neutral endopeptidases.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 3 unrelated patients with X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets (307800),
the HYP Consortium (1995) identified 3 different mutations in the PHEX
gene (300550.0001-300550.0003).

Holm et al. (1997) identified mutations in the PHEX gene in 9 of 22
unrelated patients with X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets: 3 nonsense
mutations, a 1-bp deletion leading to a frameshift, a donor-splice site
mutation, and missense mutations in 4 patients (see, e.g.,
300550.0004-300550.0006).

Dixon et al. (1998) identified a total of 31 mutations in the PHEX gene
in 46 unrelated XLH kindreds and 22 unrelated patients with nonfamilial
XLH. Thirty of the mutations were scattered throughout the putative
extracellular domain. Dixon et al. (1998) also identified 6 PHEX
polymorphisms that had heterozygosity frequencies ranging from less than
1% to 43%. Over 20% of the mutations were observed in nonfamilial XLH
patients, who represented de novo occurrences of PHEX mutations. The
majority (over 70%) of the mutations were predicted to result in a
functional loss of the PHEX protein, rather than haploinsufficiency or a
dominant-negative effect.

Filisetti et al. (1999) reported 30 newly detected mutations in the PHEX
gene, and pooled findings with all previously published mutations. The
spectrum of the mutations displayed 16% deletions, 8% insertions, 34%
missense, 27% nonsense, and 15% splice site mutations, with peaks in
exons 15 and 17. Since 32.8% of PHEX amino acids are conserved in the
family of the endopeptidases, the number of missense mutations detected
at nonconserved residues was smaller than expected, whereas the number
of nonsense mutations observed at nonconserved residues was very close
to the expected number. Compared with conserved amino acids, the changes
in nonconserved amino acids may result in benign polymorphisms or
possibly mild disease that may go undiagnosed.

Sabbagh et al. (2000) stated that 131 HYP-causing mutations in the PHEX
gene had been reported. They announced the creation of an online PHEX
mutation database for the collection and distribution of information on
PHEX mutations.

Sabbagh et al. (2001) examined the effect of PHEX missense mutations on
cellular trafficking of the recombinant protein. Four mutant PHEX cDNAs
were generated by PCR mutagenesis (e.g., E581V). Three of the mutants
were completely sensitive to endoglycosidase H digestion, indicating
that they were not fully glycosylated. Sequestration of the
disease-causing mutant proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum and plasma
membrane localization of wildtype PHEX proteins was demonstrated by
immunofluorescence and cell surface biotinylation. Sabbagh et al. (2003)
assessed the impact of 9 PHEX missense mutations on cellular
trafficking, endopeptidase activity, and protein conformation. Eight
mutations had been identified in XLH patients; the remaining mutation,
E581V, had been engineered in NEP (120520), to which PHEX shows
significant homology, where it was shown to abolish catalytic activity
but not interfere with cell surface localization of the recombinant
protein (Devault et al., 1988). The authors demonstrated that some
mutations in secreted PHEX abrogate catalytic activity, whereas others
alter the trafficking and conformation of the protein, thus providing a
mechanism whereby missense mutations result in loss of function of the
PHEX protein. Endopeptidase activity of secreted and rescued PHEX
proteins was assessed using a novel internally quenched fluorogenic
peptide substrate.

Gaucher et al. (2009) analyzed the PHEX gene in 118 probands with
hypophosphatemic rickets and identified mutations in 49 (87%) of 56
familial cases and 44 (73%) of 60 known sporadic cases. Of the 78
different mutations identified, 16 were missense mutations, which all
occurred at residues that are highly conserved in mammals. Plotting all
reported PHEX missense mutations on a 3D protein model revealed that
missense mutations are primarily located in 2 regions in the inner part
of the PHEX protein; similar plotting of nonsense mutations showed a
random distribution. One patient with late-onset disease was found to
have a mutation in an intronic region of PHEX, 2 bp away from the splice
site consensus sequence, confirming that late-onset disease is part of
the spectrum of X-linked dominant hypophosphatemic rickets.

NOMENCLATURE

The PEX nomenclature conflicts with the use of the same symbol for
multiple peroxisomal proteins (peroxins) numbered 1 to 12 or more, e.g.,
PEX5 (600414). The gene symbol PHEX has much to recommend it (Dixon et
al., 1998; Filisetti et al., 1999).

ANIMAL MODEL

- The 'Hyp' Mouse

Eicher et al. (1976) observed a mouse model for X-linked
hypophosphatemia, designated Hyp. Hyp mice have bone changes resembling
rickets, dwarfism, and high fractional excretion of phosphate ion.

By various transplantation experiments, Ecarot-Charrier et al. (1988)
demonstrated an intrinsic defect in osteoblasts in the Hyp mouse. Bell
et al. (1988) reported that primary cultures of renal epithelial cells
from the Hyp mouse demonstrate a defect in phosphate transport and
vitamin D metabolism, suggesting a defect intrinsic to the kidney.
However, in cross-transplantation studies of kidneys in normal and Hyp
mice, Nesbitt et al. (1992) found that the Hyp phenotype was neither
transferred nor corrected by renal transplantation, suggesting that the
kidney was not the target organ for the genetic abnormality. Nesbitt et
al. (1992) postulated that the disorder in the mouse, and probably in
the human, is the result of a humoral factor and is not an intrinsic
renal abnormality. Nesbitt et al. (1992) suggested the presence of a
unique hormonal effect that results in a blockade of, or failure to
express, an essential gene function in a variety of cell types.

Parabiosis (Meyer et al., 1989) and renal transplantation (Nesbitt et
al., 1992) experiments demonstrated that the renal defect in brush
border membrane sodium-dependent phosphate transport in Hyp mice is not
intrinsic to the kidney, but rather depends on a circulating humoral
factor, which is not parathyroid hormone (Meyer et al., 1989), for its
expression. In Hyp mice, Tenenhouse et al. (1994) demonstrated that the
specific reduction in renal sodium-phosphate cotransport in brush border
membranes could be ascribed to a proportionate decrease in the abundance
of kidney NPT2 (182309) cotransporter mRNA and protein. However, the
NPT2 gene is located on chromosome 5 and, hence, cannot be the site of
the mutation primarily responsible for hereditary hypophosphatemia.
Tenenhouse et al. (1994) suggested that the X-linked gene may encode the
postulated circulating humoral factor that regulates the renal
sodium-phosphate cotransporter.

Beck et al. (1997) discovered a large deletion in the 3-prime region of
the Phex gene in the Hyp mouse.

Baum et al. (2003) demonstrated that Hyp mice have a 2-fold greater
urinary prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) excretion than wildtype mice. To
determine whether prostaglandins were involved in the pathogenesis of
this disorder, Hyp and wildtype C57/B6 mice received intraperitoneal
injections with vehicle or indomethacin and were studied approximately
12 hours after the last dose of indomethacin. In the Hyp mice,
indomethacin decreased the fractional excretion of phosphate and
increased serum phosphate. There was no effect of indomethacin in the
wildtype mice. Indomethacin did not affect serum creatine or inulin
clearance, demonstrating that the normalization of urinary phosphate
excretion was not caused by changes in glomerular filtration rate.
Indomethacin treatment increased renal brush border membrane vesicle
NaPi2 protein abundance in Hyp mice to levels comparable to that of
wildtype mice. Baum et al. (2003) concluded that there is dysregulation
of renal prostaglandin metabolism in Hyp mice, and that indomethacin
treatment normalizes the urinary excretion of phosphate by a direct
tubular effect. These studies suggested that indomethacin may be an
effective form of therapy in humans with X-linked hypophosphatemia.

Lorenz-Depiereux et al. (2004) studied 2 spontaneous mutations in the
mouse Phex gene, Hyp-2J, a 7.3-kb deletion containing exon 15, and
Hyp-Duk, a 30-kb deletion containing exons 13 and 14. Both mutations
caused similar phenotypes in males, including shortened hind legs and
tail, a shortened square trunk, hypophosphatemia, hypocalcemia, and
rachitic bone disease. Hyp-Duk males also exhibited background-dependent
variable expression of deafness, circling behavior, and cranial
dysmorphology. Both Hyp-2J and Hyp-Duk males had thickened temporal bone
surrounding the cochlea and a precipitate in the scala tympani, but only
the hearing-impaired Hyp-Duk mice had degeneration of the organ of Corti
and spiral ganglion. Lorenz-Depiereux et al. (2004) noted that XLH
phenotypes could now be separated from non-XLH-related phenotypes.

During development and postnatal growth of the endochondral skeleton,
proliferative chondrocytes differentiate into hypertrophic chondrocytes,
which subsequently undergo apoptosis and are replaced by bone. Donohue
and Demay (2002) found that mice with rickets due to ablation of the
vitamin D receptor (VDR; 601769) had expansion of hypertrophic
chondrocytes due to impaired apoptosis of these cells. Sabbagh et al.
(2005) showed that institution of a rescue diet that restored mineral
ion homeostasis in Vdr-null mice prevented the development of rachitic
changes, indicating that mineral ion abnormalities, not ablation of the
Vdr gene, were the cause of impaired chondrocyte apoptosis. Similarly,
Hyp mice with rickets also showed impaired apoptosis of hypertrophic
chondrocytes, and the decreased apoptosis was correlated with
hypophosphatemia. Wildtype mice rendered hypercalcemic and
hypophosphatemic by dietary means also developed rickets. In vitro
studies showed that the apoptosis was mediated by caspase-9 (CASP9;
602234). Sabbagh et al. (2005) concluded that hypophosphatemia was the
common mediator of rickets in these cases. The findings indicated that
normal phosphorus levels are required for growth plate maturation and
that circulating phosphate is a key regulator of hypertrophic
chondrocyte apoptosis.

Yuan et al. (2008) generated mice with a global Phex knockout (Phex -/-)
and mice with conditional osteocalcin-promoted Phex inactivation only in
osteoblasts and osteocytes (OC-Phex -/-). The reduction in serum
phosphorus levels and kidney cell membrane phosphate transport as
compared to wildtype mice was similar among Hyp, Phex -/-, and OC-Phex
-/- mice; all 3 mutant strains had increased bone production and serum
FGF23 (605370) levels and decreased kidney membrane NPT2, and manifested
comparable osteomalacia. Yuan et al. (2008) concluded that aberrant Phex
function in osteoblasts and/or osteocytes alone is sufficient to
underlie the Hyp phenotype.

- The Gyro (Gy) Mouse

Lyon et al. (1986) identified a second type of X-linked dominant
hypophosphatemia in the mouse in addition to the Hyp. The phenotype,
called Gyro (Gy), is characterized by rickets/osteomalacia as in the Hyp
mouse, but also shows circling behavior, inner ear abnormalities,
sterility in hemizygous males, and a milder phenotype in heterozygous
females. The Gy and Hyp mutations have similar expression in the renal
tubule, but the Gy mutation has an additional effect on the inner ear.
The Gy allele is expressed in the inner ear of some heterozygous mice,
which show circling behavior. The authors found that Gy mapped close
(crossover value 0.4-0.8%) to Hyp. Lowe syndrome (309000) is not a human
counterpart of Gy because in that condition the transport defect is not
limited to phosphorus; moreover, characteristic morphologic changes in
the nephron observed in Lowe syndrome are not seen in the Gy mouse.

Nesbitt et al. (1987) found that PTH-dependent 1-alpha-hydroxylase
(CYP27B1; 609506) activity in the renal proximal convoluted tubule was
abnormally regulated in the Hyp mouse, whereas calcitonin-dependent
enzyme function in the proximal straight tubule was modulated normally.

In the search for a human equivalent of the Gy mutation, Boneh et al.
(1987) measured hearing in 22 patients with X-linked hypophosphatemia;
5, including 2 mother/son pairs, had sensorineural hearing deficits due
to cochlear dysfunction. The authors suggested that the disease in these
persons may be the human counterpart of Gy.

Davidai et al. (1990) provided further information on the differences
between the Hyp and Gy phenotypes in the mouse.

Collins and Ghishan (1996) found normal expression and location of the
renal Na+/P(i) transporter NPT2 in Gy mice, suggesting that the
molecular defect in the Gy mice is distinct from that in the Hyp mice,
which show a decrease in transporter activity in the renal proximal
tubules possibly related to decreased transcription (Collins et al.,
1995).

In Gy mice, Strom et al. (1997) found a deletion of the first 3 exons
and the promoter region of the PHEX, indicating that Hyp and Gy are
allelic disorders. However, Meyer et al. (1998) found that the Gyro
mouse has a partial deletion of both the Phex gene and the upstream
spermine synthase gene (300105), making it a contiguous gene syndrome in
that species. Gy is thus not as useful a model for human XLH as Hyp.

In a sporadic case of hypophosphatemia in a female (307800), Holm et al.
(1997) identified an 823T-A transversion in the PHEX gene, resulting in

identified 2 mutations that were 4-bp apart in exon 7 of the PHEX gene:
a 748T-C transition, resulting in a phe249-to-ser (F249S) substitution
and a 752G-A transition, resulting in a met250-to-ile (M250I)

HYPOPHOSPHATEMIC RICKETS, X-LINKED DOMINANT
PHEX, LEU555PRO

In affected members of a kindred originally reported by Frymoyer and
Hodgkin (1977) as having 'adult-onset vitamin D-resistant
hypophosphatemic osteomalacia' (AVDRR), Econs et al. (1998) identified a
T-to-C transition in exon 16 of the PHEX gene, resulting in a
leu555-to-pro (L555P) substitution. Frymoyer and Hodgkin (1977) had
asserted that the disorder was distinct from X-linked hypophosphatemic
rickets (307800) because affected children did not display radiographic
evidence of rickets and patients typically presented with clinical
manifestations of the disease in the fourth or fifth decade of life.
However, clinical evaluation of affected family members by Econs et al.
(1998) indicated that some displayed classic features of X-linked
hypophosphatemic rickets. The authors were unable to verify progressive
bowing in adults. Because of the clinical spectrum of X-linked
hypophosphatemic rickets and the presence of a PHEX mutation in affected
members of this kindred, the authors concluded that there is only 1 form
of X-linked dominant phosphate wasting.

.0008
HYPOPHOSPHATEMIC RICKETS, X-LINKED DOMINANT
PHEX, A-G, NT-429

In a female patient from the Indian subcontinent with X-linked
hypophosphatemic rickets (307800) and congenital adrenal hypoplasia
originally reported by Shah et al. (1988), Dixon et al. (1998)
identified an A-to-G transition at codon -429 of the 5-prime
untranslated region in the PHEX gene. The A-to-G transition was found to
cosegregate with the disease and was absent in 247 alleles examined.
Dixon et al. (1998) suggested that the mutation may lead to an
alteration in the binding sites for ribosomal and other translation
factors, such as tissue-specific regulatory proteins.

Shah et al. (1988) had termed the disorders in this Indian girl as
'familial glucocorticoid deficiency' and familial hypophosphatemic
rickets, and had suggested the possibility of a chromosomal abnormality
in activating both the X-linked hypophosphatemia locus and a closely
situated locus for glucocorticoid deficiency.

.0009
HYPOPHOSPHATEMIC RICKETS, X-LINKED DOMINANT
PHEX, IVS7, +1268, G-T

Using lymphoblastoid RNA and RT-PCR, Christie et al. (2001) investigated
11 unrelated X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets (307800) patients in whom
coding region mutations had been excluded for intronic mutations that
could lead to mRNA splicing abnormalities. One X-linked hypophosphatemia
patient was found to have 3 abnormally large transcripts resulting from
51-, 100-, and 170-bp insertions, all of which would lead to missense
peptides and premature termination codons. The origin of these
transcripts was a G-to-T transversion at position +1268 of intron 7,
which resulted in the occurrence of a high quality novel donor splice
site (ggaagg to gtaagg). Splicing between this novel donor splice site
and 3 preexisting, but normally silent, acceptor splice sites within
intron 7 resulted in the occurrence of the 3 pseudoexons.

HYPOPHOSPHATEMIC RICKETS, X-LINKED DOMINANT
PHEX, ARG567TER

Goji et al. (2006) described a family in which the father and only 1 of
his 2 daughters were affected by hypophosphatemic rickets (307800). The
pedigree interpretation of the family suggested that genetic
transmission of the disorder occurred as an autosomal dominant trait.
However, the affected daughter was heterozygous for an arg567-to-ter
(R567X) mutation in the PHEX gene, rather than in the FGF23 gene
(605370), suggesting that the genetic transmission occurred as an
X-linked dominant trait. Unexpectedly, the father was heterozygous for
this mutation. Single-nucleotide primer extension and denaturing HPLC
analysis of the father using DNA from single hair roots revealed that he
was a somatic mosaic for the mutation. Haplotype analysis confirmed that
the father transmitted the genotypes for 18 markers on the X chromosome
equally to his 2 daughters. The fact that he transmitted the mutation to
only 1 his 2 daughters indicated that he was a germline mosaic for the
mutation. Goji et al. (2006) concluded that somatic and germline
mosaicism for an X-linked dominant mutation in PHEX may mimic autosomal
dominant inheritance.

HYPOPHOSPHATEMIC RICKETS, X-LINKED DOMINANT
PHEX, IVS4, T-C, +6

Makras et al. (2008) described a mother and 2 sons with X-linked
hypophosphatemic rickets (307800) with unusual clinical features,
including normal growth. A novel splice site mutation in intron 4 of the
PHEX gene, IVS4+6G-T, that resulted in skipping of exon 4 was present in
all 3 individuals. The mother and her sons were followed in the same
institution for nearly 30 years. The mother had hypophosphatemia and
normal height without ever receiving any treatment. Her 2 sons achieved
final heights of 183.7 cm (Z score, -0.01) and 182.7 cm (Z score,
-0.18), respectively, despite late initiation of treatment with
phosphate and low serum phosphate levels. In addition, they had
reversible proximal myopathy, which took approximately 7 years to
resolve in the more severely affected son and 8 months to resolve in the
other.

606549	TITLE *606549 MEMBRANE-SPANNING 4-DOMAINS, SUBFAMILY A, MEMBER 8B; MS4A8B
DESCRIPTION MS4A family proteins share structural similarity, amino acid sequence
homology, and chromosomal location. They contain 4 highly conserved
transmembrane domains, flanked by N- and C-terminal cytoplasmic regions.

CLONING

By database searching for homologs of CD20 (MS4A1; 112210), Liang and
Tedder (2001) obtained a cDNA encoding MS4A8B. The predicted 250-amino
acid protein is 63% identical to its mouse homolog. PCR analysis
detected weak expression of MS4A8B in cDNA from 3 B-cell lines.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Liang and Tedder (2001) mapped the MS4A8B
gene to chromosome 11q12-q13, in the same region as MS4A2 (147138) and
MS4A3 (606498).
