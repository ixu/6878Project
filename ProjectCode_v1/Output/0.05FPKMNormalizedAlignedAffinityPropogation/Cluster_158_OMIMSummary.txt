603322	TITLE *603322 NADH-UBIQUINONE OXIDOREDUCTASE 1 BETA SUBCOMPLEX, 6; NDUFB6
;;COMPLEX I, MITOCHONDRIAL RESPIRATORY CHAIN, B17 SUBUNIT; B17
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase), the first multisubunit
enzyme complex of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, has about 43
subunits with a combined molecular mass of 970 kD. Of these, 7 subunits
are encoded by the mitochondrial genome (ND1-6, ND4L). The remaining
subunits are encoded by the nuclear genome (Smeitink et al., 1998)

CLONING

Smeitink et al. (1998) provided a table of 15 known nuclear subunits and
reported the cloning of an additional subunit, B17. The B17 cDNA encodes
a protein of 128 amino acids with a calculated relative mass of 15.5 kD.
There was 82.7% and 78.1% homology, respectively, at the cDNA and amino
acid levels with the bovine counterpart. Multi-tissue dot blots showed
ubiquitous expression of B17 mRNA, with relatively higher expression in
tissues known for their high energy demands. Of these, kidney showed the
highest expression. Mutation analysis of the subunit revealed no
mutations or polymorphisms in 20 patients with isolated enzymatic
complex I deficiency in cultured skin fibroblasts.

Smeitink and van den Heuvel (1999) reviewed the available molecular data
regarding the human nuclear-encoding complex I subunits.

MAPPING

By searching the GenBank STS database using the cDNA sequence of the
human B17 subunit, Smeitink et al. (1998) mapped the NDUFB6 gene
(GenBank GENBANK G30177) to chromosome 2. However, by radiation hybrid
analysis, Emahazion et al. (1998) mapped the NDUFB6 gene to 9p13.2.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

NDUFB6 is among the set of OXPHOS genes showing significant reduction in
muscle from patients with type 2 diabetes (125853) compared with healthy
control subjects (Mootha et al., 2003; see 604517). In a study of young
and elderly twins with and without type 2 diabetes, Ling et al. (2007)
found that expression of NDUFB6 in skeletal muscle decreased with age. A
-544A-G polymorphism in the NDUFB6 promoter region (dbSNP rs629566) that
creates a possible DNA methylation site was associated with a decline in
muscle NDUFB6 expression with age; increased DNA methylation was found
in the promoter of elderly but not young subjects carrying the G/G
genotype. The degree of DNA methylation correlated negatively with
muscle NDUFB6 expression, which, in turn, was associated with insulin
sensitivity. Ling et al. (2007) suggested that genetic and epigenetic
factors may interact to increase age-dependent susceptibility to insulin
resistance.

141251	TITLE *141251 HEME OXYGENASE 2; HMOX2
;;HEMOXYGENASE 2
DESCRIPTION 
GENE FUNCTION

Heme oxygenase is the rate-limiting enzyme in the heme degradative
pathway (Kutty et al., 1994). This degradative process has 2 important
products, biliverdin, the precursor of the bile pigment bilirubin, and
carbon monoxide, a putative neurotransmitter. There are 2 isozymic forms
of heme oxygenase, an inducible heme oxygenase-1 (HMOX1; 141250) and a
constitutive heme oxygenase-2 (HMOX2).

Heme oxygenase-2, which synthesizes carbon monoxide (CO), has been
localized by immunohistochemistry to endothelial cells and adventitial
nerves of blood vessels. It is also localized to neurons in autonomic
ganglia, including the petrosal, superior cervical, and nodose ganglia,
as well as ganglia in the myenteric plexus of the intestine. Zakhary et
al. (1996) demonstrated by enzyme studies that tin protoporphyrin IX is
a selective inhibitor of heme oxygenase with about 10-fold selectivity
for heme oxygenase over endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS3; 163729)
and soluble guanylyl cyclase. Inhibition of heme oxygenase activity by
tin protoporphyrin IX reverses the component of endothelial-derived
relaxation porcine distal pulmonary arteries not reversed by an
inhibitor of NOS. Thus, the authors concluded that CO, like nitric oxide
(NO), may have endothelial-derived relaxing activity; additionally, the
similarity of NOS and heme oxygenase-2 localizations and functions in
blood vessels and the autonomic nervous system implies complementary and
possibly coordinated physiologic roles for these 2 mediators.

Using immunoprecipitation studies, Takahashi et al. (2000) showed that
amyloid precursor protein (APP; 104760) and amyloid precursor-like
protein (APLP1; 104775) bound to HMOX1 and HMOX2 in the endoplasmic
reticulum and inhibited heme oxygenase activity by 25 to 35% in vitro.
Familial Alzheimer disease (AD; 104300)-associated APP mutations showed
greater inhibition (45 to 50%) of heme oxygenase. As heme oxygenase
shows antioxidative effects, the authors hypothesized that APP-mediated
inhibition of heme oxygenase may result in increased oxidative
neurotoxicity in AD.

Williams et al. (2004) demonstrated that hemoxygenase-2 is part of the
BK channel complex (600150) and enhances channel activity in normoxia.
Knockdown of hemoxygenase-2 expression reduced channel activity, and
carbon monoxide, a product of hemoxygenase-2 activity, rescued this loss
of function. Inhibition of BK channels by hypoxia was dependent on
hemoxygenase-2 expression and was augmented by hemoxygenase-2
stimulation. Furthermore, carotid body cells demonstrated
hemoxygenase-2-dependent hypoxic BK channel inhibition, which indicated
that hemoxygenase-2 is an oxygen sensor that controls channel activity
during oxygen deprivation.

MAPPING

Using the polymerase chain reaction for analysis of human/rodent somatic
cell hybrids, Kutty et al. (1994) assigned the HMOX2 gene to chromosome
16. They regionalized the assignment to 16p13.3 by fluorescence in situ
hybridization (FISH). By FISH, Saito-Ohara et al. (1997) mapped the
Hmox2 gene to mouse chromosome 16B1.

ANIMAL MODEL

Heme oxygenase activity leads to accumulation of the antioxidant
bilirubin, and degradation of the preoxidant heme. Moderate
overexpression of the inducible form, HMOX1, is associated with
protection against oxidative injury. To evaluate the role of HMOX2
(called HO-2 by the authors) in oxidative stress, Dennery et al. (1998)
investigated Hmox2 null 'knockout' mice exposed to more than 95% O(2)
compared with wildtype controls. Similar basal levels of lung
antioxidants were observed, except that the knockouts had a 2-fold
increase in total glutathione content. Despite increased Hmox1
expression from Hmox1 induction, knockout animals were sensitized to
hyperoxia-induced oxidative injury and mortality, and also had
significantly increased markers of oxidative injury before hyperoxic
exposure. The results suggested that Hmox2 functions to augment the
turnover of lung iron during oxidative stress, and that this function
does not appear to be compensated for by induction of Hmox1 in the
knockouts.

600756	TITLE *600756 PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE 2, REGULATORY SUBUNIT B-PRIME; PPP2R4
;;PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE 2A, REGULATORY SUBUNIT B-PRIME;;
PHOSPHOTYROSYL PHOSPHATASE ACTIVATOR; PTPA;;
PR53
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

PPP2R4, or PTPA, encodes a specific phosphotyrosyl phosphatase activator
of the dimeric form of protein phosphatase-2A (PP2A; see 176915) (Van
Hoof et al., 1995).

GENE FUNCTION

The core component of PP2A consists of a catalytic (C) subunit (e.g.,
PPP2CA; 176915) and a scaffold protein (A) subunit (e.g., PPP2R1A;
605983). Using purified recombinant proteins, Chao et al. (2006) found
that PTPA and PP2A A-C dimers constituted a composite ATPase, and the
interaction was independent of ATP or magnesium ion. The inclusion of
PTPA altered the substrate specificity of PP2A, with enhanced
phosphotyrosine phosphatase activity and decreased phosphoserine
phosphatase activity.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Chao et al. (2006) reported the 1.9-angstrom crystal structure of human
PTPA, which revealed a fold consisting of a core, a lid, and an extended
linker joining the core and lid. Structural analysis uncovered a highly
conserved surface patch bordering these 3 subdomains, as well as an
associated deep pocket between the core and linker subdomains. Further
analysis showed that the surface patch binds the PP2A A-C dimer, and the
deep pocket binds ATP.

GENE STRUCTURE

Van Hoof et al. (1995) demonstrated that human PTPA is encoded by a
single-copy gene composed of 10 exons and 9 introns with a total length
of about 60 kb. The 5-prime flanking sequence of the transcription start
site was analyzed for its potential as a promoter. This region lacks a
TATA sequence in the appropriate position relative to the transcription
start. However, this region is very GC-rich and contains 4 Sp1 sites
(SP1; 189906) upstream of the transcription start site, a feature common
to many TATA-less promoters. Based on homology with DNA-binding
consensus sequences of transcription factors, Van Hoof et al. (1995)
identified several additional putative transcription factor binding
sites in the promoter region. Transfection experiments with a construct
containing the PTPA promoter region inserted 5-prime of a luciferase
reporter gene demonstrated that the 5-prime flanking sequence of the
PTPA gene indeed has promoter activity that seems to be cell-line
dependent.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Van Hoof et al. (1995) mapped the
PTPA gene to 9q34. Fluorescence in situ analysis of metaphase
chromosomes of patients bearing the Philadelphia chromosome indicated
that PTPA is positioned centromeric of ABL1 (189980) and probably is not
involved in chronic myeloid leukemia.

603632	TITLE *603632 RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN S10; RPS10
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The mammalian ribosome is a macromolecular assembly of 4 RNA species
(see 180450) and approximately 80 different proteins (see 180466).

CLONING

Adams et al. (1992) isolated an RPS10 cDNA as a human brain EST.

By searching sequence databases with the partial sequences of randomly
selected cDNAs from a human colorectal cDNA library, Frigerio et al.
(1995) identified cDNAs encoding homologs of rat ribosomal proteins S5
(RPS5; 603630), S9 (RPS9; 603631), S10 (RPS10), S29 (RPS29; 603633), L5
(RPL5; 603634), L21 (RPL21; 603636), L27a (RPL27A; 603637), and L28
(RPL28; 603638). Frigerio et al. (1995) completed the cDNA sequences of
these human ribosomal proteins. The deduced 165-amino acid human RPS10
differs from rat Rps10 by 2 amino acids; neither protein contains
cysteine residues. Northern blot analysis suggested variable expression
of RPS10 in colorectal cancers compared to adjacent normal tissues,
although no correlation between the level of expression and the severity
of the disease was found.

GENE STRUCTURE

Boria et al. (2010) stated that the RPS10 gene contains 6 exons spanning
8.65 kb.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid and radiation hybrid mapping analyses, Kenmochi
et al. (1998) mapped the human RPS10 gene to chromosome 6p.

Boria et al. (2010) stated that the RPS10 gene maps to chromosome
6p21.31.

GENE FUNCTION

Using siRNA knockdown in HeLa cells to analyze the role of RPS10 in
pre-rRNA processing, Doherty et al. (2010) found that depletion of RPS10
led to decreased levels of 18S rRNA, indicating that RPS10 is necessary
for production of the small subunit. RNA blot analysis showed
accumulation of 43S, 26S, and 18S-E pre-rRNAs, consistent with defects
in cleavage at both ends of the 18S rRNA.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Doherty et al. (2010) sequenced 35 ribosomal protein genes in a cohort
of 117 patients with Diamond-Blackfan anemia (see DBA9, 613308) who were
negative for mutation in 7 known DBA genes and identified 3 mutations in
the RPS10 gene (603632.0001-603632.0003) in 5 patients.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
DIAMOND-BLACKFAN ANEMIA 9
RPS10, MET1ILE

In a male patient with Diamond-Blackfan anemia (613308), Doherty et al.
(2010) identified heterozygosity for a 3G-A transition in exon 1 of the
RPS10 gene, causing a met1-to-thr (M1T) substitution that eliminates the
start codon and is predicted to result in a truncated 144-residue
protein. The mutation was not found in at least 520 control chromosomes.

.0002
DIAMOND-BLACKFAN ANEMIA 9
RPS10, 1-BP INS, 260C

In a female patient who was diagnosed with Diamond-Blackfan anemia
(613308) at 2 months of age, Doherty et al. (2010) identified
heterozygosity for a 1-bp insertion (260insC) in exon 3 of the RPS10
gene, resulting in a frameshift and a premature termination codon. The
mutation was not found in her unaffected father or in at least 520
control chromosomes.

.0003
DIAMOND-BLACKFAN ANEMIA 9
RPS10, ARG113TER

In a male and 2 female probands with Diamond-Blackfan anemia (613308),
Doherty et al. (2010) identified heterozygosity for a 337C-T transition
in exon 4 of the RPS10 gene, resulting in an arg113-to-ter (R113X)
substitution. Two of the patients were responsive to steroid therapy;
the third, a female with a de novo mutation who was diagnosed at birth,
was unresponsive to steroid therapy and was also noted to have a webbed
neck. The mutation was not found in at least 520 control chromosomes.

125305	TITLE *125305 ERYTHROCYTE MEMBRANE PROTEIN BAND 4.9; EPB49
;;DEMATIN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Dematin, or EPB49, is an actin-bundling protein originally identified in
the erythroid membrane skeleton. Its actin-bundling activity is
abolished upon phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase and is
restored after dephosphorylation (Rana et al., 1993).

CLONING

Chishti et al. (1989) proposed the name dematin (from the Greek 'dema,'
a bundle) for an actin-bundling protein identified in the human
erythroid membrane skeleton. Rana et al. (1993) noted that dematin
consists of 2 polypeptide chains of 48 and 52 kD that were identified as
protein 4.9 on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. In solution, dematin exists as a
trimer and bundles actin filaments in a phosphorylation-dependent
manner. Rana et al. (1993) cloned dematin from a human reticulocyte cDNA
library. The deduced 383-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular
mass of 43 kD. Dematin has a polyglutamine motif that may constitute a
nuclear localization signal, a PEST sequence, a C-terminal domain highly
similar to the C-terminal headpiece domain of villin (VIL; 193040), and
several putative phosphorylation sites. Northern blot analysis detected
variable dematin expression in all tissues examined. Immunofluorescence
microscopy revealed punctate dematin staining around the cell nucleus in
cultured human erythroblasts.

Although dematin is an actin-bundling protein of the erythroid membrane
skeleton, it is abundantly expressed in human brain, heart, skeletal
muscle, kidney, and lung. Azim et al. (1995) reported the primary
structure of the 52-kD subunit of dematin, which differs from the 48-kD
subunit by a 22-amino acid insertion within its headpiece domain. A
unique feature of the insertion sequence of the 52-kD subunit is its
homology to erythrocyte protein 4.2 (177070).

GENE FUNCTION

Rana et al. (1993) confirmed that purified human dematin possessed
actin-bundling activity in vitro. Protease treatment and microsequencing
revealed that the C-terminal headpiece domain bound actin filaments, but
it did not have actin-bundling activity.

Azim et al. (1996) demonstrated that dematin and protein 4.2 bound ATP.

Gilligan and Bennett (1993) provided a review.

MAPPING

Using somatic cell hybrid panels and fluorescence in situ hybridization,
Azim et al. (1995) localized the dematin gene to chromosome 8p21.1, a
site distal to the locus of ankyrin (612641) at chromosome 8p11.2.

Peters et al. (1995) demonstrated that the murine dematin gene,
symbolized Epb4.9, maps to chromosome 14. They raised the possibility
that dematin mutations may be involved in neurologic abnormalities in
the mouse.

ANIMAL MODEL

By using homologous recombination in mouse embryonic stem cells, Khanna
et al. (2002) deleted the headpiece domain of dematin to evaluate its
function in vivo. Dematin headpiece-null mice were viable and born at
the expected mendelian ratio. Hematologic evaluation showed evidence of
compensated anemia and spherocytosis in these mice, however. The
headpiece-null erythrocytes were osmotically fragile, and displayed
reduced deformability and filterability. In vitro, significantly greater
membrane fragmentation of these erythrocytes was demonstrated.
Biochemical characterization showed a weakened membrane skeleton
evidenced by reduced association of spectrin and actin to the plasma
membrane. Together, these results provided evidence for the physiologic
significance of dematin and demonstrated a role for the headpiece domain
in the maintenance of structural integrity and mechanical properties of
red cells in vivo.

Chen et al. (2007) created double-knockout mice lacking beta-adducin
(ADD2; 102681) and the headpiece domain of dematin. Double-knockout pups
were pale compared with wildtype pups, but otherwise they appeared
grossly normal. Peripheral blood analysis showed severe hemolytic anemia
with reduced number of erythrocytes/hematocrit/hemoglobin and an
approximately 12-fold increase in the number of circulating
reticulocytes. The presence of a variety of misshapen and fragmented
erythrocytes correlated with increased osmotic fragility and reduced in
vivo life span. Mutant erythrocyte membranes showed weak retention of
spectrin-actin complexes, increased grain size, decreased filament
number, and features consistent with the presence of large protein
aggregates. Chen et al. (2007) concluded that dematin and adducin are

613788	TITLE *613788 MICRO RNA 152; MIR152
;;miRNA152;;
MIRN152
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MicroRNAs, such as MIR152, are noncoding RNAs of 18 to 24 nucleotides
that bind the 3-prime UTRs of target mRNAs and control protein
expression through translational repression or mRNA degradation. MIR148B
regulates the innate immune response (Liu et al., 2010).

GENE FUNCTION

Using computer and functional analyses, Liu et al. (2010) identified 3
members of the MIR148 family, Mir148a (613786), Mir148b (613787), and
Mir152, as negative regulators of the innate immune response and the
antigen-presenting capacity of mouse dendritic cells (DCs). Expression
of Mir148a, Mir148b, and Mir152 was upregulated in mouse DCs on
maturation and activation induced by Tlr3 (603029), Tlr4 (603030), and
Tlr9 (605474) agonists. In contrast, expression of Camk2a (114078), an
important DC regulator, was downregulated in the presence of these
agonists. Mir148/Mir152 overexpression inhibited production of
cytokines, including Il12 (see 161560), Il6 (147620), Tnf (191160), and
Ifnb, (147640), upregulation of major histocompatibility complex class
II expression, and DC-initiated antigen-specific T-cell proliferation by
targeting Camk2a expression. Liu et al. (2010) proposed that MIR148A,
MIR148B, and MIR152 fine tune the innate immune response.

MAPPING

Gross (2011) mapped the MIR152 gene to chromosome 17q21.32 based on an
alignment of the mature MIR152 sequence (UCAGUGCAUGACAGAACUUGG) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).
