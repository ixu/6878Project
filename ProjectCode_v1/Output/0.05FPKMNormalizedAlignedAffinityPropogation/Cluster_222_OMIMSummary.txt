DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The ST3GAL3 gene encodes
beta-galactoside-alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase-III, a Golgi resident
membrane protein that forms the sialyl Lewis a (sLe-a) epitope on
glyocoproteins. These glycoproteins form the glycocalyx, composed of
sialic acids that act as key determinants of a variety of cellular
recognition and communication processes (summary by Hu et al., 2011).

CLONING

By screening a human placenta cDNA library with a probe based on the
sialyl motif (a highly conserved region in the catalytic domain of
sialyltransferases), Kitagawa and Paulson (1993) isolated a cDNA
encoding SIAT6, which they termed ST3N (EC 2.4.99.6). The deduced
375-amino acid protein is 97% identical to the rat protein. SDS-PAGE
analysis showed expression of an 80-kD protein having sialyltransferase
activity. Northern blot analysis revealed wide expression of a 2.7-kb
transcript with abundant expression in skeletal muscle and high
expression in fetal tissue but low expression in placenta.

Using Northern blot analysis, Kitagawa and Paulson (1994) evaluated the
differential expression of 5 human sialyltransferase genes in adult and
fetal tissues. A 2.7-kb ST3N transcript was expressed highly in skeletal
muscle and moderately in most other tissues examined. A 3.8-kb
transcript was also expressed in testis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Taniguchi et al. (2003) determined that the 5-prime UTR of the ST3GAL3
gene consists of 2 exons. The 5-prime flanking region of the promoter
lacks canonical TATA or CCAAT boxes, but it contains several putative
transcriptional factor binding sites.

Hu et al. (2011) stated that the ST3GAL3 gene contains 15 exons, 12 of
which are coding exons.

MAPPING

The International RH Mapping Consortium mapped the SIAT6 gene to
chromosome 1 (TMAP stSG22084).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Autosomal Recessive Mental Retardation 12

In affected members of 2 unrelated consanguineous Iranian families with
autosomal recessive nonsyndromic mental retardation-12 (MRT12; 611090),
Hu et al. (2011) used linkage analysis, chromosome sorting, and
next-generation sequencing to identify 2 different homozygous mutations
in the ST3GAL3 gene (A13D, 606494.0001 and D370Y, 606494.0002,
respectively.) Neither mutation affected the highly conserved sialyl
motifs, but rather affected the N-terminal transmembrane domain and
catalytic domain, respectively. In vitro functional expression studies
showed that the mutant proteins were mislocalized to the endoplasmic
reticulum and that one (D370Y) had loss of catalytic activity. The
findings demonstrated a link between the glycoprotein complex,
sialyltransferase activity, and higher cognitive functioning.

- Early Infantile Epileptic Encephalopathy 15

In 4 members of a consanguineous Palestinian family with early infantile
epileptic encephalopathy-15 (EIEE15; 615006), Edvardson et al. (2013)
identified a homozygous mutation in the ST3GAL3 gene (A320P;
606494.0003). The mutation was identified by linkage analysis combined
with whole-exome sequencing of 1 individual and confirmed by Sanger
sequencing. The mutation affected the highly conserved sialyl motif S,
which is crucially involved in binding of both donor and acceptor
substrate. In vitro functional expression studies showed that secretion
of the mutant protein was reduced to 25% of control levels and it had no
detectable enzymatic activity. The phenotype was severe: patients showed
delayed psychomotor development and had onset of refractory infantile
spasms between ages 3 and 7 months associated with hypsarrhythmia on
EEG. Other features included hypotonia, poor eye contact, and inability
to speak or walk, even later in childhood. All were profoundly mentally
retarded. Edvardson et al. (2013) noted that the phenotype was more
severe than that observed by Hu et al. (2011), who had identified
ST3GAL3 mutations outside of the highly conserved and functionally
important sialyl motifs.

MENTAL RETARDATION, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE 12
ST3GAL3, ALA13ASP

In affected members of a consanguineous Iranian family with autosomal
recessive mental retardation-12 (MRT12; 611090), previously reported by
Najmabadi et al. (2007), Hu et al. (2011) identified a homozygous 38C-A
transversion in exon 2 of the ST3GAL3 gene, resulting in an ala13-to-asp
(A13D) substitution in the transmembrane domain. The mutation was not
found in 278 copies of chromosome 1 from ethnically matched controls or
in 385 control individuals. In vitro functional expression studies in
murine fibroblasts showed that most of the mutant protein was improperly
localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, preventing the protein from
interacting with its substrates in the Golgi, resulting in a loss of
function. Catalytic activity of the A13D mutant enzyme was similar to
wildtype.

ST3GAL3, ASP370TYR

In affected members of a consanguineous Iranian family with autosomal
recessive mental retardation-12 (MRT12; 611090), Hu et al. (2011)
identified a homozygous 1108G-T transversion in exon 14 of the ST3GAL3
gene, resulting in an asp370-to-tyr (D370Y) substitution in the
catalytic domain at the C-terminal end of the protein. The mutation was
not found in 278 copies of chromosome 1 from ethnically matched controls
or in 385 control individuals. In vitro functional expression studies in
murine fibroblasts showed that the mutant protein was improperly
localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, preventing the protein from
interacting with its substrates in the Golgi, resulting in a loss of
function. The D370Y mutant protein also showed a complete lack of enzyme
activity. Studies of recombinant proteins in CHO cells indicated that
secretion of the D370Y mutant protein was dramatically reduced compared
to wildtype. Hu et al. (2011) concluded that the mutant protein was
cleared by the endoplasmic reticulum-mediated system, suggesting that
the C terminus is important for the proper folding of functional
ST3GAL3.

ST3GAL3, ALA320PRO

In 4 members of a consanguineous Palestinian family with early infantile
epileptic encephalopathy-15 (EIEE15; 615006), Edvardson et al. (2013)
identified a homozygous 958G-C transversion in exon 12 of the ST3GAL3
gene, resulting in an ala320-to-pro (A320P) substitution at a highly
conserved residue in the sialyl motif S. The mutation was identified by
linkage analysis combined with whole-exome sequencing of 1 individual
and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. It segregated with the disorder in
the family and was not found in 123 controls of the same ethnic origin
or in 5,379 control exomes. In vitro functional expression studies
showed that secretion of the mutant protein was reduced to 25% of
control levels and that the protein had no detectable enzymatic
activity.

608880	TITLE *608880 ZINC FINGER FYVE DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 16; ZFYVE16
;;ENDOSOME-ASSOCIATED FYVE DOMAIN PROTEIN; ENDOFIN;;
KIAA0305
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The ZFYVE16 gene encodes endofin, an endosomal protein implicated in
regulating membrane trafficking. It is characterized by the presence of
a phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate-binding FYVE domain positioned in the
middle of the molecule (Seet et al., 2004).

CLONING

Using BLAST analysis to search for uncharacterized proteins containing
FYVE domains, Seet and Hong (2001) identified cDNA KIAA0305. KIAA0305,
corresponding to the ZFYVE16 gene, encodes endofin, a predicted
1,539-amino acid protein that contains a central FYVE domain followed by
a putative Smad-binding domain. Endofin shows similar organization to
SARA (603755); the 2 proteins share approximately 50% identity in the
C-terminal regions. Northern blot analysis showed ubiquitous expression
of 7.4- and 5.5-kb endofin transcripts.

GENE FUNCTION

Using indirect immunofluorescence, Seet and Hong (2001) showed that
endofin is expressed in early endosomes, similar to EEA1 (605070).
Expression constructs of truncated endofin showed that the FYVE domain
is required for endosomal expression, and treatment with the PI3-kinase
inhibitor wortmannin showed that endosomal localization of endofin is
dependent on PI3-kinase activity. While indirect immunofluorescence
showed colocalization of endofin and SARA, coimmunoprecipitation
experiments demonstrated that the 2 proteins do not associate with each
other. Unlike SARA, endofin does not affect TGF-beta (190180)-induced
transcriptional activity. Overexpression of endofin caused endosomal
aggregate formation, and these aggregates accumulated EGF (131530) and
prevented its degradation.

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis with the C-terminal portion of endofin as
bait against a human brain cDNA library, Seet et al. (2004) identified
TOM1 (604700) as an endofin binding partner. GST pull-down and
coimmunoprecipitation assays confirmed that the C-terminal region of
endofin binds to the C-terminal region of TOM1. Endofin does not bind to
the closely related proteins TOM1L1 (604701) or TOM1L2. While
immunofluorescence showed a cytosolic distribution of TOM1, density
gradient analysis showed partially overlapping expression of TOM1 and
endofin in early endosomes. Overexpression of endofin recruits TOM1 to
endosomal aggregates.

607764	TITLE *607764 3-@BETA-HYDROXY-DELTA-5-C27-STEROID OXIDOREDUCTASE; HSD3B7
;;C27-3-BETA-HSD
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Schwarz et al. (2000) used expression cloning to isolate cDNAs encoding
a microsomal 3-beta-hydroxy-delta-5-C27-steroid oxidoreductase that is
expressed predominantly in the liver. The predicted product showed 34%
sequence identity with the C19 and C21 3-beta-HSD enzymes, which
participate in steroid hormone metabolism. Schwarz et al. (2000)
observed that, when transfected into cultured cells, the enzyme encoded
by the C27 3-beta-HSD cDNA was active against four 7-alpha-hydroxylated
sterols, indicating that a single C27 3-beta-HSD enzyme can participate
in all pathways of bile acid synthesis known to that time. The expressed
enzyme did not metabolize several different C19/21 steroids as
substrates. The levels of hepatic C27 3-beta-HSD mRNA in the mouse were
not sexually dimorphic and did not change in response to dietary
cholesterol or to changes in bile acid pool size. The human C27
3-beta-HSD gene encodes a protein of 369 amino acids that is about 86%
identical to the mouse protein.

MAPPING

Schwarz et al. (2000) mapped the human HSD3B7 gene to chromosome
16p12-p11.2 by analysis of radiation hybrid panels.

GENE STRUCTURE

Schwarz et al. (2000) determined that the HSD3B7 gene contains 6 exons
and spans 3 kb of DNA.

GENE FUNCTION

Schwarz et al. (2000) observed that the C27 3-beta-HSD enzymes are
active only against 7-alpha hydroxylated sterol substrates. Human C27
3-beta-HSD enzymes were active against the 7-alpha hydroxylated forms of
24-hydroxycholesterol, 25-hydroxycholesterol, and 27-hydroxycholesterol
and showed no preference for any of those compounds. Northern blot
analysis identified a single 2.4-kb species present at high levels in
liver, pancreas, and kidney, and at lower levels in heart, skeletal
muscle, and placenta.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Schwarz et al. (2000) identified a 2-bp deletion in the C27 3-beta-HSD
gene (607764.0001) in a patient with a congenital defect in bile acid
synthesis (CBAS1; 607765) and neonatal cholestasis.

Cheng et al. (2003) performed a molecular analysis of 15 additional
patients from 13 kindreds with C27 3-beta-HSD deficiency deficiency and
identified 12 different mutations in the HSD3B7 gene (see, e.g.,
607764.0001-607764.0005). They studied 10 mutations in detail; these
were shown to cause complete loss of enzyme activity and, in 2 cases,
alterations in the size or amount of the transcribed RNA. Mutations were
homozygous in 13 patients from 10 families and heterozygous in 4
patients from 3 families. Cheng et al. (2003) concluded that a diverse
spectrum of HSD3B7 mutations underlies this rare form of neonatal
cholestasis.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
BILE ACID SYNTHESIS DEFECT, CONGENITAL, 1
HSD3B7, 2-BP DEL, NT1057

In a Saudi Arabian boy with neonatal progressive intrahepatic
cholestasis (607765), the fifth child of consanguineous parents in the
family originally described by Clayton et al. (1987), Schwarz et al.
(2000) identified a 2-bp deletion in exon 6 of the HSD3B7 gene. This
mutation was found in homozygosity and was not present in 25 healthy
controls. It was predicted to shift the translational reading frame,
causing premature termination and the removal of 23 amino acids from the
carboxy terminus of the protein. In vitro studies showed that the
protein carrying the 2-bp deletion prevented the production of enzyme
capable of isomerizing and oxidizing the 7-alpha-hydroxylated forms of
24-hydroxycholesterol, 25-hydroxycholesterol, and 27-hydroxycholesterol.

Cheng et al. (2003) confirmed this mutation in the family of Clayton et
al. (1987) and found it in a second consanguineous Saudi family. They
determined that the 1057deltaCT mutation gives rise to a protein in
which the first 346 amino acids of the normal protein are fused to a
5-residue extension. The mutation was found to produce mRNAs that were
similar in size and amount to those derived from the normal gene but
failed to encode an active enzyme when introduced into HEK293 cells. It
was not known whether inactivation resulted from elimination of the
normal C-terminal sequences or addition of the spurious residues.

In a French family with neonatal cholestasis caused by C27 3-beta-HSD

mutation in intron 2 of the HSD3B7 gene, 340+1G-T.

In 2 French families with neonatal cholestasis caused by C27 3-beta-HSD
deficiency (607765), Cheng et al. (2003) found a missense mutation in
HSD3B7, glu147 to lys (E147K). The amino acid substitution resulted from
a G-to-A transition in exon 4. Although an apparently stable mRNA of
normal abundance was transcribed from the mutant gene, no enzyme
activity was detected in transfected cells. Glutamate-147 is conserved
among all members of the 3-beta-HSD enzyme family in human, mouse, and
rat.

In a British and a Canadian family with neonatal cholestasis caused by

of AG at nucleotide 63 in exon 1 of the HSD3B7 gene.

300342	TITLE *300342 MELANOMA ANTIGEN, FAMILY A, 9; MAGEA9
;;MAGE9
DESCRIPTION The MAGEA family consists of 12 genes (MAGEA1 to MAGEA12), of which 6,
MAGEA1 (300016), MAGEA2 (300173), MAGEA3 (300174), MAGEA4 (300175),
MAGEA6 (300176), and MAGEA12 (300177), are expressed in melanomas and
other cancers. For further background information on the MAGEA family,
see 300016.

CLONING

De Plaen et al. (1994) identified the 12 MAGEA genes. MAGEA9 appeared to
be a weakly expressed member of the family. Rogner et al. (1995)
isolated a MAGEA9 cDNA from a fetal brain cDNA library.

MAPPING

By analysis of cell hybrids, ordered YACs, and cosmids, Rogner et al.
(1995) localized the MAGEA cluster to Xq28. They showed that the 12
genes are arranged in 3 clusters within 3.5 Mb.

See 300016 for a discussion of the high frequency of genes on the X
chromosome encoding proteins with the MAGE domain as well as other
cancer-testis antigen genes (Ross et al., 2005).

606696	TITLE *606696 KATANIN, p60 SUBUNIT, A1; KATNA1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Microtubules are dynamic polymers of alpha-tubulin (e.g., TUBA3; 602529)
and beta-tubulin (TUBB; 191130) that are used to organize membranous
organelles during interphase and to segregate chromosomes during
mitosis. Microtubule-severing proteins generate internal breaks within
microtubules during metaphase but not during interphase. Katanin is an
ATP-dependent microtubule-severing protein composed of p60 and p80
subunits. Katanin p80 (KATNB1; 602703) is concentrated at centrosomes
during interphase.

CLONING

By searching an EST database for homologs of sea urchin p60 katanin,
followed by 3-prime RACE with fibroblast cDNA, McNally and Thomas (1998)
isolated a cDNA encoding KATNA1. Sequence analysis predicted that the
491-amino acid KATNA1 protein contains a central consensus cyclin B
(CCNB1; 123836)/CDC2 (116940) phosphorylation site (TPLK). The
N-terminal 80 residues of KATNA1 and sea urchin p60 katanin are 50%
identical, and the C-terminal 318-residue AAA (for 'ATPase associated
with a variety of cellular activities') ATPase domain of KATNA1 and sea
urchin p60 katanin are 75% identical. Immunoblot analysis revealed wide
expression of a 55- to 60-kD protein that was coexpressed with p80
katanin in frog eggs. Anti-KATNA1 antibody inhibited
microtubule-severing activity in Xenopus eggs. Immunofluorescence
microscopy demonstrated diffuse expression and focal colocalization with
gamma-tubulin (TUBG; 191135) in interphase fibroblast microtubule
asters, as is also seen with KATNB1. McNally and Thomas (1998) observed
that the area occupied by KATNA1 is twice that occupied by TUBG during
metaphase. McNally and Thomas (1998) proposed that CCNB1/CDC2 activates
KATNA1 microtubule-severing activity near centrosomes during mitosis.

Using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical analysis, Karabay et
al. (2004) showed that Katna1 localizes along the length of axons at
early stages of neuronal development in the rat and mouse, with
expression generally higher in and near growth cones of extending axons
and in distal regions. Katna1 expression declined upon neuronal
maturation.

GENE FUNCTION

Toyo-Oka et al. (2005) identified KATNA1 as a molecular target of NDEL1
(607538). Phosphorylation of Ndel1 by Cdk5 (123831) facilitated
interaction between NDEL1 and KATNA1, suggesting that phosphorylated
NDEL1 may regulate the distribution of KATNA1. Abnormal accumulation of
Katna1 in the nucleus of Ndel1-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts
supported an essential role for NDEL1 in KATNA1 regulation. Complete
loss of Ndel1 or expression of dominant-negative Katna1 mutants in
migrating neurons resulted in defective migration and elongation of
nuclear-centrosomal distance. Toyo-Oka et al. (2005) suggested that
NDEL1 may be essential for mitotic cell division and neuronal migration,
not only via regulation of cytoplasmic dynein function, but also by
modulation of KATNA1 localization and function.

Postmitotic neurons require microtubules for dynamic scaffolding within
axons, dendrites, and growth cones. Microtubules are nucleated
exclusively at centrosomes and must be severed from the centrosome for
transport into the axon; shorter microtubules are transported along
axons more quickly than long microtubules. Using overexpression and
knockdown studies with cultured rodent neurons, Karabay et al. (2004)
showed that Katna1 is an active microtubule-severing enzyme with a
critical role in neuronal microtubule dynamics. Katna1 expression
dropped when axons were presented with target cells that caused them to
stop growing.

Iwaya et al. (2010) showed that the N-terminal microtubule interacting
and trafficking (MIT) domains of mouse and human KATNA1 bound
unpolymerized, but not polymerized, tubulin. The isolated MIT domain of
KATNA1 formed an antiparallel 3-stranded helix, with a hydrophobic core
of partly conserved alanine residues. Mutagenesis experiments revealed
that positively charged arg49 and lys67 of helix 3 are required for
tubulin binding. A coiled-coil region that follows the MIT domain
mediates dimer formation and when included in the protein fragment
interfered with binding of the MIT domain to tubulin.

Using cDNA constructs based on mouse p60 and p80 (602703), Iwaya et al.
(2012) showed that the N-terminal MIT domain of p60 interacted with the
C-terminal domain (CTD) of p80. Binding of either microtubules or the
p80-CTD to the p60 MIT domain stimulated the ATPase and
microtubule-severing activity of p60. Ca(2+) bound to a separate region
of the MIT domain of p60 and negatively regulated microtubule- or
p80-enhanced p60 activity. Ca(2+) did not inhibit the basal ATPase
activity of p60 or the binding of p60 to microtubules.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the KATNA1
gene to chromosome 6 (TMAP EST392905).

Hartz (2012) mapped the KATNA1 gene to chromosome 6q25.1 based on the
alignment of the KATNA1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF056022) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

608076	TITLE *608076 TYROSINE KINASE, NONRECEPTOR, 1; TNK1
;;CD38-NEGATIVE KINASE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TNK1 is a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase. These kinases, like members of
the SRC (190090) and JAK (see 147795) families, mediate intracellular
signaling downstream of receptor activation.

CLONING

Using degenerate primers based on conserved tyrosine kinase motifs,
Hoehn et al. (1996) cloned TNK1 by PCR of cDNA from CD38
(107270)-negative umbilical cord blood cells enriched for early
progenitors. They obtained the full-length TNK1 cDNA by 5-prime and
3-prime RACE of an erythroleukemia cell line cDNA library. The deduced
666-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of about 72 kD.
TNK1 contains a putative N-terminal phosphotyrosine-binding domain,
followed by the tyrosine kinase domain, a putative SH3 domain, and a
proline-rich C terminus that contains SH3-binding motifs. The kinase
domain has all 12 structural features conserved in tyrosine kinases,
including an ATP-binding site. TNK1 shares highest homology with ACK
(606994), including 45% amino acid identity over a 413-amino acid span
that includes the kinase domain and putative SH3 domain. Northern blot
analysis detected a 3.0-kb transcript in prostate, testis, ovary, small
intestine, and colon. Northern blot analysis of fetal tissues detected
tissue-specific expression of 4 transcripts between 1.0 and 9.5 kb in
fetal brain, lung, liver, and kidney. RT-PCR detected TNK1 expression in
all bone marrow, cord blood, and peripheral blood cells examined, and in
16 of 20 leukemia cell lines.

MAPPING

By PCR of rodent/human cell lines and FISH, Hoehn et al. (1996) mapped
the TNK1 gene to chromosome 17p13.1.

600960	TITLE *600960 SET TRANSLOCATION, MYELOID LEUKEMIA-ASSOCIATED; SET
;;INHIBITOR OF GZMA-ACTIVATED DNase; IGAAD
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The translocation (6;9)(p23q34) is the hallmark of a specific subtype of
acute myeloid leukemia (AML) characterized by a poor prognosis and a
young age of onset. It is classified in the French-American-British
(FAB) system mostly as M2/M4 and rarely as M1 or refractive anemia with
excess of blast cells (RAEB). On chromosome 9, breakpoints take place in
a specific intron, denoted icb-9, of a large gene named Cain (CAN;
114350). On chromosome 6, breakpoints occur in a single intron, icb-6,
of a gene named DEK (125264). In a patient with acute undifferentiated
leukemia and an apparently normal karyotype, von Lindern et al. (1992)
found a breakpoint in icb-9 of the CAN gene in a bone marrow sample but
detected no breakpoint in DEK. They isolated and characterized a novel
gene, named SET (suppressor of variegation, enhancer of zeste, and
Trithorax), that was fused to CAN in the leukemic cells of this patient.
A chimeric SET-CAN transcript whose sequence predicted a fusion protein
of 155 kD was detected. The SET gene encodes transcripts of 2.0 and 2.7
kb that result from the use of alternative polyadenylation sites. Both
transcripts contained the open reading frame for a putative protein with
a predicted molecular mass of 32 kD. The SET sequence showed homology
with the yeast nucleosome assembly protein NAP-I. The only common
sequence motif of SET and DEK proteins is an acidic region. SET has a
long acidic tail, of which a large part is present in the predicted
SET-CAN fusion protein.

GENE FUNCTION

Carlson et al. (1998) studied the role of SET in the regulation of renal
cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. The mRNA encoding SET was
expressed at much higher levels in transformed human and rodent cell
lines than in cultured renal epithelial and primary endothelial cells.
Consistent with a role for SET in cell proliferation, SET mRNA
expression was markedly reduced in cells rendered quiescent by serum
starvation, contact inhibition, or differentiation. Previous findings
during renal development were extended by demonstrating that SET protein
expression is also much greater in developing rat and human kidney than
in fully differentiated, mature kidney. Finally, high levels of SET mRNA
and SET protein expression were found in Wilms tumor but not in renal
cell carcinoma, adult polycystic kidney disease, or in transitional cell
carcinoma. The SET domain (Tschiersch et al., 1994) is found in proteins
that are involved in embryonic development (Tripoulas et al., 1996).

Granzyme A (GZMA; 140050) induces a caspase-independent cell death
pathway characterized by single-stranded DNA nicks and other features of
apoptosis. A GZMA-activated DNase (GAAD) is in an endoplasmic
reticulum-associated complex containing pp32 (600832) and the GZMA
substrates SET, HMG2 (163906), and APE1 (107748). Fan et al. (2003)
showed that GAAD is NM23H1 (156490), a nucleoside diphosphate kinase
implicated in suppression of tumor metastasis, and its specific
inhibitor (IGAAD) is SET. NM23H1 bound SET and was released from
inhibition by GZMA cleavage of SET. After GZMA loading or cytotoxic T
lymphocyte attack, SET and NM23H1 translocated to the nucleus and SET
was degraded, allowing NM23H1 to nick chromosomal DNA. GZMA-treated
cells with silenced NM23H1 expression were resistant to GZMA-mediated
DNA damage and cytolysis, while cells overexpressing NM23H1 were more
sensitive.

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis using the N-terminal 277 amino acids of SET
as bait, Minakuchi et al. (2001) identified SET-binding protein-1
(SETBP1; 611060). Deletion and mutagenesis analysis revealed that amino
acids 182 to 223 of SET interacted with amino acids 1238 to 1434 of
SETBP1. Immunoprecipitation analysis verified that SETBP1 interacted
with endogenous SET in a human osteosarcoma cell line.

Ischemia and seizure cause excessive neuronal excitation that is
associated with brain acidosis and neuronal cell death. Liu et al.
(2008) found that the neurotoxin kainic acid activated lysosomal
asparagine endopeptidase (AEP, or LGMN; 602620) in mouse brain and
triggered degradation of Set, followed by DNA nicking and neuronal cell
death. Pike-L (CENTG1; 605476) strongly bound Set in the nucleus and
protected Set from proteolytic cleavage by Aep in vitro and in vivo,
thereby diminishing DNA damage and neuronal cell death. Kainic acid or
stroke failed to provoke DNA nicking and neuronal cell death in
Aep-deficient mice.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, von Lindern et al. (1992)
assigned the SET gene to 9q34, centromeric of ABL (189980).

604221	TITLE *604221 ACTIN-RELATED PROTEIN 2; ACTR2
;;ARP2
ARP2/3 COMPLEX, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The protrusion of the cell membrane is fundamental to cell shape change
and locomotion. Actin polymerization (see 102560) plays a critical role
in this process. The leading edge of motile cells is dominated by thin
actin-rich structures called lamellipodia, which exhibit highly dynamic
behavior characterized by rapid extension and retraction. Many aspects
of the mechanism of lamellipodial protrusion are echoed in the
intracellular motility of certain bacterial and viral pathogens, such as
the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes. Welch et al. (1997) purified an
approximately 220-kD multiprotein complex from human platelets that
induces actin polymerization at the L. monocytogenes cell surface and
mediates bacterial motility. This complex contains actin-related
proteins (Arps) in the Arp2 and Arp3 families and therefore was named
the Arp2/3 complex. In addition to 43-kD ARP2 and 50-kD ARP3 (ACTR3;
604222), the human complex consists of 41/40- (ARPC1B; 604223), 34-
(ARPC2; 604224), 21- (ARPC3; 604225), 20- (ARPC4; 604226), and 16-kD
(ARPC5; 604227) subunits, all present in approximately equal
stoichiometry. By searching an EST database with peptide sequences from
the 7 subunits of the human ARP2/3 complex, Welch et al. (1997)
identified full-length human cDNAs encoding each subunit. The ARP2 cDNA
encodes a deduced 394-amino acid protein that is 99% identical to
chicken Arp2 and 67% identical to S. cerevisiae Arp2. Welch et al.
(1997) localized several subunits of the ARP2/3 complex to the
lamellipodia of stationary and locomoting fibroblasts, as well as to the
actin tails assembled by L. monocytogenes. They suggested that the
ARP2/3 complex promotes actin assembly in lamellipodia and may
participate in lamellipodial protrusion.

Machesky et al. (1997) purified the ARP2/3 complex from human
neutrophils and sequenced peptides from each of the subunits.

GENE FUNCTION

Leisel et al. (1999) used pure components of the actin cytoskeleton to
reconstitute sustained movement in Listeria and Shigella in vitro.
Actin-based propulsion was driven by the free energy released by ATP
hydrolysis linked to actin polymerization and did not require myosin
(see 601478). In addition to actin and activated Arp2/3 complex, actin
depolymerizing factor and capping protein (see 601571) were also
required for motility as they maintained a high steady-state level of
G-actin (see 102610), which controls the rate of unidirectional growth
of actin filaments at the surface of the bacterium. The movement was
more effective when profilin (see 176610), alpha-actinin (see 102575),
and, in the case of Listeria, VASP (601703) were also included.

The protein N-WASP (WASL; 605056) regulates actin polymerization by
stimulating the actin-nucleating activity of the Arp2/3 complex. N-WASP
is tightly regulated by multiple signals; only costimulation by CDC42
(116952) and phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP2) yields
potent polymerization. Prehoda et al. (2000) found that regulation
requires N-WASP's constitutively active output domain
(verprolin/cofilin/acidic (VCA) domain) and 2 regulatory domains, a
CDC42-binding domain and a PIP2-binding domain. In the absence of
stimuli, the regulatory modules together hold the VCA-Arp2/3 complex in
an inactive 'closed' conformation. In this state, both the CDC42- and
PIP2-binding sites are masked. Binding of either input destabilizes the
closed state and enhances binding of the other input. This cooperative
activation mechanism shows how combinations of simple binding domains
can be used to integrate and amplify coincident signals.

Using fluorescence anisotropy analysis, Marchand et al. (2001) showed
that efficient actin nucleation requires both recruitment of an actin
monomer to the ARP2/3 complex and a subsequent activation step. The
initial steps in this pathway involve binding by the WA domain of
WASP/SCAR (605035) proteins, which consists of a WH2 motif (W) that
binds to the actin monomers and an acidic tail (A) that binds to the
ARP2/3 complex. Actin filaments seem to stimulate nucleation by
enhancing binding of WA to the ARP2/3 complex and favoring the formation
of a productive nucleus.

Weisswange et al. (2009) analyzed the dynamics of N-WASP,
WASP-interacting protein (WIP; 602357), GRB2 (108355), and NCK (600508),
which are required to stimulate ARP2/3 complex-dependent actin-based
motility of vaccinia virus, using fluorescence recovery after
photobleaching. Weisswange et al. (2009) showed that all 4 proteins are
rapidly exchanging, albeit at different rates, and that the turnover of
N-WASP depends on its ability to stimulate ARP2/3 complex-mediated actin
polymerization. Conversely, disruption of the interaction of N-WASP with
GRB2 and/or the barbed ends of actin filaments increases its exchange
rate and results in a faster rate of virus movement. Weisswange et al.
(2009) suggested that the exchange rate of N-WASP controls the rate of
ARP2/3 complex-dependent actin-based motility by regulating the extent
of actin polymerization by antagonizing filament capping.

Nolen et al. (2009) described 2 classes of small molecules that bind to
different sites on the Arp2/3 complex and inhibit its ability to
nucleate actin filaments. CK-0944636 binds between Arp2 and Arp3, where
it appears to block movement of Arp2 and Arp3 into their active
conformation. CK-0993548 inserts into the hydrophobic core of Arp3 and
alters its conformation. Both classes of compounds inhibit formation of
actin filament comet tails by Listeria and podosomes by monocytes.

Using immunofluorescence microscopy, Western blot analysis, and
knockdown strategies with human lung fibroblasts, Hanisch et al. (2011)
showed that Salmonella entered nonphagocytic cells by manipulating 2
machineries of actin-based motility in the host: actin polymerization
through the ARP2/3 complex, and actomyosin-mediated contractility in a
myosin IIA (MYH9; 160775)- and myosin IIB (MYH10; 160776)-dependent
manner. Hanisch et al. (2011) concluded that Salmonella entry can be
effected independently of membrane ruffling.

Li et al. (2012) showed that interactions between diverse synthetic,
multivalent macromolecules (including multidomain proteins and RNA)
produce sharp liquid-liquid-demixing phase separations, generating
micrometer-sized liquid droplets in aqueous solution. This macroscopic
transition corresponds to a molecular transition between small complexes
and large, dynamic supramolecular polymers. The concentrations needed
for phase transition are directly related to the valency of the
interacting species. In the case of the actin-regulatory protein N-WASP
(605056) interacting with its established biologic partners NCK (600508)
and phosphorylated nephrin (602716), the phase transition corresponds to
a sharp increase in activity towards an actin nucleation factor, the
ARP2/3 complex. The transition is governed by the degree of
phosphorylation of nephrin, explaining how this property of the system
can be controlled to regulatory effect by kinases. Li et al. (2012)
concluded that the widespread occurrence of multivalent systems suggests
that phase transitions may be used to spatially organize and
biochemically regulate information throughout biology.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Volkmann et al. (2001) performed electron cryomicroscopy and
3-dimensional reconstruction of Acanthamoeba castellanii and S.
cerevisiae Arp2/3 complexes bound to the WASP (301000) carboxy-terminal
domain. Asymmetric, oblate ellipsoids were revealed. Image analysis of
actin branches indicated that the complex binds the side of the mother
filament, and ARP2 and ARP3 are the first 2 subunits of the daughter
filament. Comparison to the actin-free WASP-activated complexes suggests
that branch initiation involves large-scale structural rearrangements
within ARP2/3.

Robinson et al. (2001) determined the crystal structure of bovine ARP2/3
complex at 2.0-angstrom resolution. ARP2 and ARP3 are folded like actin,
with distinctive surface features. Subunits ARPC2 and ARPC4 in the core
of the complex associate through long carboxy-terminal alpha helices and
have similarly folded amino-terminal alpha/beta domains. ARPC1 is a
7-blade beta propeller with an insertion that may associate with the
side of an actin filament. ARPC3 and ARPC5 are globular alpha-helical
subunits. Robinson et al. (2001) predicted that WASP/SCAR proteins
activate ARP2/3 complex by bringing ARP2 into proximity with ARP3 for
nucleation of a branch on the side of a preexisting actin filament.

CLONING

By searching for sequences similar to the 2 conserved C-terminal domains
of MCAF1 (ATF7IP1; 613644), followed by PCR, Ichimura et al. (2005)
cloned ATF7IP2, which they called MCAF2. The deduced full-length protein
contains 681 amino acids. Conserved domains 1 and 2 of MCAF1 and MCAF2
share 27% and 56% amino acid identity, respectively. Database analysis
revealed that domain 2 shows highest conservation between species.
Western blot analysis of several human cell lines detected variable
ATF71IP2 expression at an apparent molecular mass of 100 kD.
Fluorescence-tagged MCAF1 and MCAF2 colocalized with MBD1 (156535) at
nuclear foci.

GENE FUNCTION

Ichimura et al. (2005) showed that both MCAF1 and MCAF2 bound to the
C-terminal transcriptional repression domain (TRD) of MBD1. Removal of
domain 2 of MCAF1 or MCAF2 abolished the interactions with MBD1 in vitro
and abolished colocalization of these proteins with MBD1 at nuclear foci
in cultured human cells. MCAF1 and MCAF2 also bound the transcriptional
regulators SETDB1 (604396) and SP1 (189906). Immunoprecipitation
analysis of K562 human erythroleukemia cells revealed that MCAF1 showed
higher affinity for SETDB1 than SP1, whereas MCAF2 showed higher
affinity for SP1 than SETDB1. Both MCAF proteins were also detected in
the same immunoprecipitates. Both MCAF1 and MCAF2 increased
transcription of a reporter gene activated by SP1, and the TRD of MBD1
moderately repressed transcription in the presence of either MCAF1 or
MCAF2. The combination of MCAF1, the TRD of MBD1, and SETDB1 caused
marked transcriptional repression in a SETDB1-dependent manner. In
contrast, SETDB1 had no effect on promoter activity in the presence of
MCAF2 and the TRD of MBD1. Knockdown of MCAF1 in HeLa cells abolished
repression by the TRD of MBD1, and exogenous expression of MCAF2 partly
compensated for MCAF1 knockdown.

MAPPING

Hartz (2010) mapped the ATF7IP2 gene to chromosome 16p13.13 based on an
alignment of the ATF7IP2 gene (GenBank GENBANK AK022730) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

602525	TITLE *602525 PYRUVATE DEHYDROGENASE KINASE, ISOENZYME 2; PDK2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

PDK2 belongs to the family of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) kinases (EC
2.7.11.2), which reversibly inactivate the mitochondrial PDH complex by
ATP-dependent serine phosphorylation of the alpha subunit of the
complex's E1 component (see 300502) (summary by Korotchkina and Patel,
2001).

CLONING

By screening a human liver cDNA library with rat Pdk2, Gudi et al.
(1995) cloned PDK2. The deduced 407-amino acid protein, with a
calculated molecular mass of 46.2 kD, has a putative mitochondrial
protein kinase catalytic domain with 5 characteristic subdomains. The
human and rat proteins share 96% identity. Northern blot analysis
detected variable expression of a 2.4-kb PDK2 transcript in all 8 human
tissues examined, with highest expression in heart, followed by skeletal
muscle.

GENE FUNCTION

Gudi et al. (1995) noted that the products of the PDH reaction stimulate
the kinase activity of PDKs, whereas the substrates are inhibitory. ADP
also acts synergistically with pyruvate to inhibit PDK kinase activity.
Using kinase-depleted PDH complexes isolated from rat heart as
substrate, Gudi et al. (1995) found that recombinant human PDK1
(602524), PDK2, and PDK3 (602526) inactivated PDH in an ATP-dependent
manner. PDK3 showed the highest kinase activity, and PDK2 the lowest.
However, the products of the PDH reaction, NADH and acetyl-CoA,
increased the ability of PDK2 to inhibit PDH.

Baker et al. (2000) found that the E2 subunit of PDH (DLAT; 608770), and
the isolated second N-terminal lipoyl (L2) domain of E2, differentially
enhanced the rates at which recombinant human PDK2 and PDK3
phosphorylated E1. There was little direct activation of PDK2 by the
free L2 domain, but the E2 60mer, which forms the core structure of the
PDH complex, enhanced PDK2 activity by 10-fold. PDK3 was activated
17-fold by E2; the majority of this activation was facilitated by the
free L2 domain. PDK2 and PDK3 also differed in their inhibition by
pyruvate, ADP, dichloroacetic acid, and acetylated lipoyl groups,
activation by NADH and acetyl-CoA, and combined effect of mixed
inhibitors and activators.

Each of the 2 E1 alpha subunits of PDH contains 3 serines that are
phosphorylated by PDKs. Using recombinant enzymes expressed in E. coli
and double site mutants of human E1, Korotchkina and Patel (2001) found
that rat Pdk1, Pdk2, and Pdk4 (602527), and human PDK3, showed unique
specificity and activity toward each of these serines. Only Pdk1 had
detectable activity with site 3, which the authors called ser203. Each
kinase also showed unique activity in the presence or absence of E2 in
complex with its binding partner E3BP (PDHX; 608769), and unique
sensitivity to the redox and/or acetylation state of the lipoyl moieties
of E2, and the buffer system employed.

Boulatnikov and Popov (2003) found that rat Pdk1 and Pdk2 could form
homodimers when expressed singly, or heterodimers when expressed
together, in E. coli. The heterodimeric kinase was catalytically active,
with kinetic parameters, site specificity, and regulation clearly
distinct from those of homodimeric Pdk1 or Pdk2. The Pdk1-Pdk2
heterodimers catalyzed phosphorylation of E1 site 3 serine, in addition
to sites 1 and 2 serines. Homodimers of Pdk1 or Pdk2 and the Pdk1-Pdk2
heterodimer also readily bound the isolated E2 component of PDH as well
as the E2-E3BP subcomplex. Interactions were strengthened by the
presence of the lipoate prosthetic groups in E2.

The nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activator receptors (PPARs; see
PPARA, 170990) are critical regulators of fatty acid oxidation. Using
quantitative real-time PCR, Degenhardt et al. (2007) found that
expression of PDK2, PDK3, and PDK4, but not PDK1, was induced by
PPAR-beta/delta (PPARD; 600409) agonists. In mice, induction of
PPAR-beta/delta increased renal expression of Pdk2 and Pdk4, but not
Pdk1 or Pdk3. In both human and mouse cells, PDK4 showed strongest
induction by PPAR-beta/delta ligands. Ligands for other PPAR subtypes
showed weaker regulation of PDK gene expression. In silico analysis,
chromatin immunoprecipitation, and Western blot analysis revealed that
PPAR-beta/delta bound regulatory elements in the PDK2, PDK3, and PDK4
genes, but not the PDK1 gene, and activated transcription in association
with its regulatory partners RXR-alpha (RXRA; 180245), PGC1-alpha
(PPARGC1A; 604517), and TRAP220 (MED1; 604311), and phosphorylated RNA
polymerase II (see POLR2A, 180660). Degenhardt et al. (2007) also found
that fibroblasts from Ppard-null mice showed reduced expression of Pdk2,
Pdk3, and Pdk4 compared with wildtype fibroblasts. Expression of Pdk4
was reduced 1200-fold. Degenhardt et al. (2007) concluded that PDK2,
PDK3, and PDK4 genes are primary PPAR targets and that PPAR-beta/delta
is a major regulator of PDK4 expression.

MAPPING

Hartz (2013) mapped the PDK2 gene to chromosome 17q21.33 based on an
alignment of the PDK2 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK055119) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

;;MALCAVERNIN;;
CHROMOSOME 7 OPEN READING FRAME 22; C7ORF22;;
OSMOSENSING SCAFFOLD FOR MEKK3; OSM
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The CCM complex, which includes CCM1 (KRIT1; 604214), CCM2, and CCM3
(PDCD10; 609118), is associated with cytoskeletal elements, signal
transduction components, and cell junctions (Hogan et al., 2008).

CLONING

In a study of cerebral cavernous malformations type 2 (603284), Liquori
et al. (2003) performed mutational analysis on a positional candidate
gene, MGC4607 (CCM2), located in the critical linkage region in the UCSC
human genome assembly. The gene was chosen because its translation
product contains a putative PTP domain. The same domain had been found
in ICAP1-alpha (607153), a binding partner of the CCM1 product KRIT1
(604214), which is mutant in cerebral cavernous malformations type 1
(116860).

Liquori et al. (2003) named the novel protein encoded by the CCM2 gene
malcavernin. They suggested that it may be part of the complex pathway
of integrin signaling that, when perturbed, causes abnormal vascular
morphogenesis in the brain, leading to CCM formation. Liquori et al.
(2003) found, from Northern blot analysis of human tissues, using the
entire cDNA as a probe, that MCG4607 is most highly expressed in
skeletal muscle, heart, and liver, with minimal or no expression in the
colon and lung. MGC4607 is also expressed in the brain.

Using Western blot analysis, Uhlik et al. (2003) found that CCM2, which
they called OSM, was expressed in the majority of mouse and human cell
types tested. Northern blot and in situ hybridization of mouse tissues
showed highest Osm expression in nervous system and lymphoid tissues.

GENE STRUCTURE

Liquori et al. (2003) determined that the CCM2 gene contains 10 exons
and spans 77.6 kb. It contains LINE and SINE elements, including Alu
sequences, within intron 1 and the 3-prime region distal to exon 10.

MAPPING

By linkage analysis, Craig et al. (1998) mapped the CCM2 gene to
chromosome 7p15-p13.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis of a mouse T-cell cDNA library, Uhlik et al.
(2003) showed that a C-terminal fragment of mouse Osm interacted with
Mekk3 (MAP3K3; 602539), a p38 (MAPK14; 600289) activator that responds
to sorbitol-induced hyperosmotic conditions. Mekk3 and Osm colocalized
in the cytoplasmic compartment of cotransfected cells, and the Mekk3-Osm
complex was recruited to Rac1 (602048)- and cytoskeletal actin (see
102560)-containing membrane ruffles in response to sorbitol treatment.
Protein interaction assays showed that Osm interacted directly with the
Mekk3 substrate Mkk3 (MAP2K3; 602315), with actin, and with both GDP-
and GTP-loaded Rac1. Uhlik et al. (2003) concluded that the
RAC1-OSM-MEKK3-MKK3 complex is required for regulation of p38 activity
in response to osmotic shock.

Zawistowski et al. (2005) used coimmunoprecipitation, fluorescence
resonance energy transfer, and subcellular localization strategies to
show that KRIT1 interacted with CCM2. Analogous to the established
interactions of KRIT1/ITGB1 (135630) and KRIT1/ICAP1, the KRIT1/CCM2
association was dependent upon phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain of
CCM2. A familial CCM2 L198R mutation (607929.0007) abrogated the
KRIT1/CCM2 interaction, suggesting that loss of this interaction may be
critical in CCM pathogenesis. CCM2 and ICAP1, when bound to KRIT1 via
their respective PTB domains, differentially influenced KRIT1
subcellular localization. The authors expanded upon the established
involvement of CCM2 in the p38 MAPK signaling module by demonstrating
that KRIT1 associated with CCM2 and MEKK3 in a ternary complex.
Zawistowski et al. (2005) proposed that the genetic heterogeneity
observed in familial CCM may reflect mutation of different molecular
members of a coordinated signaling complex.

By GST pull-down and coimmunoprecipitation analysis, Voss et al. (2007)
demonstrated that CCM2 coprecipitated and colocalized with CCM3 (PDCD10;
609118). Yeast 2-hybrid analysis showed that CCM3 directly bound to
STK25 (602255) and the phosphatase domain of FAP1 (600267). CCM3 was
phosphorylated by STK25, whereas the C-terminal domain of FAP1
dephosphorylated CCM3. Further experiments showed that STK25 and CCM2
formed a protein complex. The findings linked CCM3 and STK25 with CCM2,
which is part of signaling pathways that are essential for vascular
development. Voss et al. (2007) hypothesized that CCM3 is part of the
KRIT1/CCM2 protein complex through its interaction with CCM2, and
therefore may participate in CCM1-dependent modulation of ITGB1
signaling.

Using RNA interference, Crose et al. (2009) showed that knockdown of
Ccm2 in mouse brain endothelial cells led to increased monolayer
permeability, decreased tubule formation, and reduced cell migration
following wounding. These effects were associated with elevated levels
of RhoA (165390), a small GTPase necessary for cytoskeletal turnover and
migration. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis revealed that both Ccm2 and
Mekk3 directly bound the RhoA ubiquitin ligase Smurf1 (605568). Domain
analysis revealed that the PTB domain of Ccm2 directly bound the HECT
domain of Smurf1, and the interaction targeted Smurf1 to Ccm2 complexes
localized primarily at the cell periphery. Coexpression of Ccm2 and
Smurf1 led to cell rounding, likely due to loss of RhoA. Crose et al.
(2009) concluded that CCM2 contributes to endothelial cell integrity by
regulating SMURF1-directed RHOA degradation

Kleaveland et al. (2009) showed that knockdown of CCM2 in human
umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) via small hairpin RNA had no
effect on cell size, proliferation, migration, or formation of branching
structures. However, branched cords formed by CCM2-knockdown HUVECs
often lacked visible lumens, suggesting a defect in endothelial tube
formation. Using mice and zebrafish lacking Ccm2 and/or Heg1 (614182)
and CCM2-knockdown HUVECs, Kleaveland et al. (2009) showed that
CCM2-HEG1 signaling regulated endothelial tube formation and endothelial
junction formation. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments and pull-down
assays in transfected HEK293T cells suggested a model in which HEG1
coupled with CCM2 primarily through interaction with KRIT1 at
endothelial cell-cell junctions.

Borikova et al. (2010) showed that knockdown of Ccm1, Ccm2, or Ccm3 in
mouse embryonic endothelial cells induced RhoA overexpression and
persistent RhoA activity at the cell edge, as well as in the cytoplasm
and nucleus. RhoA activation was especially pronounced following Ccm1
knockdown. Knockdown of Ccm1, Ccm2, or Ccm3 inhibited formation of
vessel-like tubes and invasion of extracellular matrix. Knockdown or
inhibition of Rock2 countered these effects and was associated with
inhibition of RhoA-stimulated phosphorylation of myosin light chain-2
(MLC2; see 160781). Borikova et al. (2010) concluded that the CCM
protein complex regulates RhoA activation and cytoskeletal dynamics.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Liquori et al. (2003) screened a cohort of 37 probands with cerebral
cavernous malformations for KRIT1 mutations and found mutations of this
gene in 10. Among the panel of 27 probands without a KRIT1 mutation,
they detected 8 different mutations in MGC4607. One mutation, a 4-bp
deletion (607929.0004), was found in 2 separate families which, as
suggested by a further investigation into ethnic background, may be
distantly related.

Denier et al. (2004) likewise identified the MGC4607 gene as the CCM2
gene. They narrowed the CCM2 linkage interval from 22 cM to 7.5 cM. They
then hypothesized that large deletions might be involved in the
disorder, as already reported in other hamartomatous conditions such as
tuberous sclerosis (191100) and neurofibromatosis (162200). They
performed a high density microsatellite genotyping of this 7.5-cM
interval in search of putative null alleles in 30 unrelated families. In
this way, they identified, in 2 families, null alleles that were the
result of deletions within a 350-kb interval. Additional microsatellite
and single-nucleotide polymorphism genotyping showed that these 2
distinct deletions overlapped and that both of them deleted the first
exon of MGC4607. In both families, 1 of the 2 MGC4607 transcripts was
not detected. They then identified 8 additional point mutations within
MGC4607 in 8 of the remaining families. One of them led to the
alteration of the initiation codon and 5 of them to a premature
termination, including 1 nonsense, 1 frameshift, and 3 splice-site
mutations. The findings in cerebral cavernous malformations strongly
suggest that MGC4607 has a role in vascular morphogenesis.

Liquori et al. (2007) commented that DNA sequence analysis of the genes
CCM1 (KRIT1), CCM2, and CCM3 (PDCD10) in a cohort of 63 CCM-affected
families showed that 40% of these lacked any identifiable mutation. The
data suggested either that another CCM gene exists or that a significant
fraction of CCM mutations are not found by routine DNA sequence
analysis. Potential mutations that would be undetected by sequence
analysis included mutations within regulatory regions not included in
routine sequencing, as well as larger genomic insertions, deletions, or
duplications. Liquori et al. (2007) used multiplex ligation-dependent
probe analysis to screen 25 probands who were negative for CCM1, -2, and
-3 mutations for potential deletions or duplications within these 3
genes. They identified 15 deletions: 1 in the CCM1 gene, none in the
CCM3 gene, and 14 in the CCM2 gene. In this cohort, mutation screening
that included sequence and deletion analyses gave disease-gene
frequencies of 40% for CCM1, 38% for CCM2, 6% for CCM3, and 16% with no
mutation detected. The data indicated that the prevalence of CCM2 is
much higher than previously predicted, nearly equal to CCM1, and that
large genomic deletions in the CCM2 gene represent a major component of
this disorder. A common 77.6-kb deletion spanning CCM2 exons 2 through
10 was identified, which was present in 13% of the entire CCM cohort
(607929.0008). Liquori et al. (2007) hypothesized that these deletions
occurred in a hypermutable region because of surrounding repetitive
sequence elements and may catalyze the formation of intragenic
deletions.

In 2 (14%) of 14 unrelated patients with sporadic CCM and multiple
lesions, Felbor et al. (2007) identified a respective deletion in the
CCM2 gene using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. One of
the deletions involved the entire coding region of the CCM2 gene.

Among 24 Italian families with CCM, Liquori et al. (2008) identified 4
deletions and 1 duplication in the CCM2 gene.

For each of the 3 CCM genes, Pagenstecher et al. (2009) showed complete
localized loss of either KRIT1, CCM2/malcavernin, or PDCD10 protein
expression depending on the respective inherited mutation. Cavernous but
not adjacent normal or reactive endothelial cells of known germline
mutation carriers displayed immunohistochemical negativity only for the
corresponding CCM protein, but stained positively for the 2 other
proteins. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated endothelial cell
mosaicism as neoangiogenic vessels within caverns from a CCM1 patient,
normal brain endothelium from a CCM2 patient, and capillary endothelial
cells of vessels in a revascularized thrombosed cavern from a CCM3
patient stained positively for KRIT1, CCM2/malcavernin, and PDCD10
respectively. Pagenstecher et al. (2009) suggested that complete lack of
CCM protein in affected endothelial cells from CCM germline mutation
carriers supports a 2-hit mechanism for CCM formation.

Through repeated cycles of amplification, subcloning, and sequencing of
multiple clones per amplicon, Akers et al. (2009) identified somatic
mutations that were otherwise invisible by direct sequencing of the bulk
amplicon. Biallelic germline and somatic mutations were identified in
CCM lesions from all 3 forms of inherited CCMs. The somatic mutations
were found only in a subset of the endothelial cells lining the
cavernous vessels and not in interstitial lesion cells. Although widely
expressed in the different cell types of the brain, the authors also
suggested a unique role for the CCM proteins in endothelial cell
biology. Akers et al. (2009) suggested that CCM lesion genesis may
require complete loss of function for 1 of the CCM genes.

Gallione et al. (2011) identified a founder mutation in the Ashkenazi
Jewish population that affects mRNA splicing of the CCM2 gene causing
cerebral cavernous malformations (607929.0010).

ANIMAL MODEL

Hogan et al. (2008) found that deletion of Ccm1 in zebrafish caused
dilation of embryonic vessels. Vascular dilation was associated with
progressive spreading of endothelial cells and thinning of vessel walls.
Determination of cell fate, cell number, and endothelial cell-cell
contacts appeared normal. Ccm1 mutants, Ccm2 mutants, and Ccm1/Ccm2
double mutants had indistinguishable vascular phenotypes, suggesting
conservation of function.

Boulday et al. (2011) noted that deletion of Ccm1, Ccm2, or Ccm3 in mice
is embryonic lethal. They generated mice with an endothelial-specific
Ccm2 deletion at postnatal day 1, which resulted in vascular lesions
mimicking human CCM lesions. Deletion of Ccm1 or Ccm3 at postnatal day 1
resulted in similar cerebellar and retinal lesions. Ccm2 lesion
development was restricted to the venous bed. Boulday et al. (2011)
concluded that the consequences of Ccm2 deletion depend on the
developmental timing of the ablation and are associated with a
developmental stage with intense angiogenesis.

cavernous malformations (603284) were associated with a 4-bp deletion in
exon 2 of the CCM2 gene (169-172delAGAC). The deletion caused a
frameshift at amino acid 57 with a premature stop at amino acid 58. Two

CCM2, 77.6-KB DEL

Among a cohort of 63 families with cerebral cavernous malformations
(603284), Liquori et al. (2007) identified a 77.6-kb deletion in the
CCM2 gene in 8 probands (13%). The deletion encompassed exons 2 through
10, with the proximal breakpoint within an AluSx repeat in intron 1 and
the distal breakpoint within an AluSg repeat distal to exon 10.
Haplotype analysis suggested that this deletion may have occurred
independently at least twice in their cohort, although the evidence was
not conclusive.

Liquori et al. (2008) reported 6 additional CCM families from the United
States with the 77.6-kb CCM2 deletion. Haplotype analysis, which
included the previously reported families with this deletion, indicated
a founder effect. This deletion was not present in 24 Italian families
with CCM, indicating that it is specific to a certain cohort of
patients.

CEREBRAL CAVERNOUS MALFORMATIONS 2
CCM2, IVS1, GC-TT, +5

In 7 apparently unrelated probands from 10 different kindreds of
Ashkenazi Jewish descent segregating CCM2 (603284), Gallione et al.
(2011) identified a 2-bp change in the CCM2 gene caused by deletion of a
GC pair and insertion of a TT pair near the splice donor site of exon 1
(30+5_6delinsTT). The 2-bp change segregated with affected status in the
study families. Transcripts arising from the normal and mutant alleles
were examined by RT-PCR from affected and unaffected Ashkenazi Jewish
cerebral cavernous malformation family members. A synthetic splicing
system using a chimeric exon was used to visualize the effects of the
change on splice donor site utilization. The 2-bp change, when tested in
this in vitro synthetic splicing system, altered splice donor site
utilization. RT-PCR revealed loss of the transcript allele that was in
phase with the mutation. Gallione et al. (2011) concluded that this 2-bp
change in CCM2 disruted proper splice donor utilization leading to a
degraded transcript. Resequencing of the genomic region proximal and
distal to the CCM2 gene mutation revealed a common SNP haplotype in
affected individuals that demonstrated that this mutation was due to a
founder in the Ashkenazi Jewish population.

;;PROLINE-RICH TYROSINE KINASE 2; PYK2;;
FOCAL ADHESION KINASE 2; FAK2;;
CELL ADHESION KINASE, BETA; CAKB
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Focal adhesion kinases are cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine kinases
associated with focal adhesions and whose activity is induced by ligand
binding to various receptors including those for integrin, growth
factors, etc. FAKs are known to target paxillin (602505) and are
substrates for Src family kinases (see 190090) (Calalb et al., 1995).
Herzog et al. (1996) identified a gene for another focal adhesion kinase
by low-stringency screening of a hippocampus cDNA library. They
symbolized the gene FAK2. The FAK2 cDNA encodes a predicted 1,009-amino
acid protein with 42% identity to FAK1 (600758). Northern blot analysis
detected a 4.5-kb mRNA in brain, kidney, spleen, and lymphocytes.

Protein-tyrosine kinases in the central nervous system are activated in
response to a variety of neurotrophic factors that control neuronal
differentiation and survival via cell surface receptors. Also, protein
phosphorylation is involved in membrane excitability and the function of
ion channels. Lev et al. (1995) discovered a nonreceptor type protein
kinase that is highly expressed in adult rat brain. The kinase, which
they symbolized PYK2 (proline-rich tyrosine kinase-2), was cloned from a
rat spinal cord cDNA library using degenerate PCR primers corresponding
to conserved tyrosine kinase motifs of PYK1 (see Manser et al., 1993).
Lev et al. (1995) cloned the human homolog from a human fetal brain cDNA
library using the rat sequence as a probe. The predicted protein of
1,009 amino acids has 61% sequence identity to the FAK1 protein (PTK2;
600758).

GENE FUNCTION

Lev et al. (1995) showed that the PYK2 protein undergoes rapid tyrosine
phosphorylation in response to various stimuli that elevate
intracellular calcium concentration, such as addition of bradykinin, a
neuropeptide hormone that binds to a G protein-coupled receptor and in
turn stimulates phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis. PYK2 is also tyrosine
phosphorylated following activation of the nicotinic acetylcholine
receptor (see 100690), by membrane depolarization, and by treatment of
cells with a calcium ionophore. Protein kinase C (176960) activation
also induces PYK2 phosphorylation. Activation of PYK2 leads to the
modulation of ion channel function and activation of the MAP kinase
signaling pathway. Lev et al. (1995) proposed that PYK2 may represent an
important signaling intermediate between neuropeptide activated
receptors or neurotransmitters that increase calcium flux and the
downstream signals that regulate neuronal activity. PYK2 may also
provide a mechanism for a variety of short- and long-term
calcium-dependent signaling events in the nervous system.

Matsuya et al. (1998) found specific interaction between the C-terminal
region of PYK2 and HIC5 (TGFB1I1; 602353). Both proteins were
tyrosine-phosphorylated in parallel in rat fibroblasts exposed to
hypertonic osmotic stress or stimulated with lysophosphatidic acid.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) causes acute and chronic infection of the liver
and is also a risk factor for hepatic cancer. The virus has only 4 open
reading frames, 3 of which encode the capsid, envelope, and polymerase
proteins. The fourth encodes HBX, a poorly expressed protein required
for viral replication (Ganem, 2001). Bouchard et al. (2001) showed that
HBX induces release of calcium into the cytoplasm, presumably from
mitochondria or endoplasmic reticulum. HBX expression thereby induces
activation of PYK2, which activates SRC and HBV DNA replication.
Inhibition of PYK2 or calcium signaling mediated by mitochondrial
calcium channels could block HBV DNA replication, and enhancement of
cytoplasmic calcium was able to substitute for HBX in stimulating HBV
DNA replication.

In a kidney proximal epithelial cell line (OKP) incubated in acid media,
Li et al. (2004) observed an increase in PYK2 phosphorylation and
PYK2/SRC binding. Transfection of OKP cells with dominant-negative PYK2
or small interfering PYK2 duplex RNA blocked acid activation of
sodium/hydrogen exchanger-3 (NHE3, or SLC9A3; 182307), whereas neither
had an effect on glucocorticoid activation of NHE3. Dominant-negative
PYK2 also blocked acid activation of SRC kinase, which is required for
acid regulation of NHE3. Li et al. (2004) concluded that PYK2 is
directly activated by acidic pH and that PYK2 activation is required for
acid activation of SRC kinase and NHE3. Partially purified PYK2 was
activated by acid in a cell-free system, leading Li et al. (2004) to
suggest that PYK2 may serve as the pH sensor that initiates the
acid-regulated signaling cascade involved in NHE3 regulation.

MAPPING

Herzog et al. (1996) assigned the FAK2 gene to chromosome 8 by PCR
analysis of somatic cell hybrid DNAs and localized it to 8p22-p11.2 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization.

ANIMAL MODEL

Buckbinder et al. (2007) found that Pyk2-null mice were normal in
appearance and body weight, but they had increased bone mass and
improved bone microstructure. Mouse bone marrow cultures showed that
Pyk2 deficiency enhanced differentiation and activity of osteoprogenitor
cells, as did expression of PYK2-specific short hairpin RNA or dominant
interfering proteins in human mesenchymal stem cells. Daily
administration of a small molecule Pyk2 inhibitor increased bone
formation and protected against bone loss in ovariectomized rats, an
established preclinical model of postmenopausal osteoporosis.

Using Pyk2 -/- mice, Kamen et al. (2011) showed that Pyk2 was required
for integrin-mediated degranulation responses in polymorphonuclear
neutrophils (PMNs), but not in adhesion-induced cell spreading or
activation of superoxide production. Pyk2-deficient PMNs also displayed
reduced migration on fibrinogen (see 134820)-coated surfaces and reduced
paxillin and Vav (VAV1; 164875) phosphorylation after integrin ligation.
Clearance of Staphylococcus aureus skin abscesses was poor in Pyk2 -/-
mice. The response to soluble agonists, however, was normal. Kamen et
al. (2011) concluded that PYK2 is involved in regulating
adhesion-mediated release of PMN granule contents.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Mollereau et al. (1994) used degenerate PCR based on sequences of known
opioid receptors to clone a novel receptor, which they termed ORL1, from
a human brainstem cDNA library. The cDNA encodes a 370-amino acid
polypeptide with general features of a G protein-coupled receptor and
highest homology with other opioid receptors and, to a lesser extent,
somatostatin receptors. The ORL1 protein is 49 to 50% identical to the
murine mu (600018), delta (165195), and kappa (165196) opioid receptors.
In situ hybridization to central nervous system tissues from mouse
revealed that the gene is expressed in many regions of the mouse brain
and spinal cord, particularly in limbic and hypothalamic structures.

Wick et al. (1995) screened a human lymphocyte library for opioid
receptors and isolated a cDNA, termed AT7-5EU, whose coding region is
identical to ORL1. This clone, however, has a different 5-prime
untranslated region, perhaps indicating a mechanism for tissue-specific
expression of this receptor. Northern blotting showed that AT7-5EU is
expressed in human lymphocyte cell lines of both B- and T-cell lineages
and is induced at least 10-fold by activation of lymphocytes with
phytohemagglutinin.

GENE FUNCTION

Mollereau et al. (1994) expressed the ORL1 cDNA in CHO cells and found
that ORL1 mediates inhibition of adenylyl cyclase by etorphine, a
universal opioid agonist.

Meunier et al. (1995) and Reinscheid et al. (1995) showed that the
17-amino acid neuropeptide nociceptin/orphanin FQ (601459) is the
natural agonist of the ORL1 receptor. Ma et al. (1997) found that the
NG108-15 neuronal cell line endogenously expresses the ORL1 receptor. In
these cells, the ORL1 receptor can be desensitized by treatment with its
ligand, nociceptin/orphanin FQ, and does not crossreact with specific
ligands of the delta opioid receptor.

Using RT-PCR analysis, Serhan et al. (2001) showed that both
polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) and monocytes express ORL1. Binding
analysis determined that PMNs have a high-affinity receptor. Chemotactic
assays indicated that nociceptin induces PMN chemotaxis over a wide
concentration range without stimulating calcium mobilization or altering
calcium mobilization in response to other chemoattractants. In a mouse
air pouch model, Serhan et al. (2001) confirmed the chemoattractant
capacity of nociceptin in vivo, which could be blocked by the
administration of an aspirin-triggered lipid analog. Serhan et al.
(2001) proposed that release of nociceptin from afferent nerve fibers
may contribute to leukocyte trafficking and the recruitment of PMNs to
the site of inflammation.

To clarify possible involvement of the nociceptin receptor in the
regulation of nociception and locomotion, Noda et al. (1998) used
nociceptin receptor knockout mice and naloxone benzoylhydrazone
(NalBzoH), which was originally identified as a ligand for opioid
receptors. Experiments on cultured cells transfected with nociceptin
receptor cDNA showed that NalBzoH competed with tridiated nociceptin
binding and attenuated the nociceptin-induced inhibition of cyclic AMP
accumulation. Furthermore, behavioral studies demonstrated that NalBzoH
completely inhibited nociceptin-induced hyperalgesia and hypolocomotion.
Noda et al. (1998) concluded that NalBzoH can likely act as a potent
antagonist for the nociceptin receptor in vivo. In wildtype mice,
NalBzoH induced antinociception but did not affect locomotor activity.
In contrast, in the knockout mice, no significant changes in nociception
and locomotion were induced by NalBzoH. Noda et al. (1998) suggested
that the nociceptin system takes part in the physiologic regulation of
nociceptive thresholds but not in the basal modulation of locomotion.

In vitro, Beedle et al. (2004) showed that expression of human ORL1 with
N-type calcium channels resulted in a tonic voltage-dependent G-protein
inhibition of the calcium channel that occurred in the absence of
nociceptin, the ORL1 receptor agonist. Tonic inhibition of the current
was dependent on receptor density. The application of nociceptin further
reduced the current amplitude. Biochemical characterization showed that
N-type calcium channels and ORL1 receptors form a signaling complex
which efficiently exposes N-type channels to constitutive ORL1 receptor
activity. The findings demonstrated that some calcium channel activity
is regulated by changes in ORL1 receptor expression.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Although NOP shares high sequence similarity with classical opioid GPCR
subtypes (approximately 60%), NOP has a markedly distinct pharmacology,
featuring activation by the endogenous peptide N/OFQ (601459), and
unique selectivity for exogenous ligands. Thompson et al. (2012)
reported the crystal structure of human NOP, solved in complex with the
peptide mimetic antagonist compound-24 (C-24), revealing atomic details
of ligand-receptor recognition and selectivity. C-24 mimics the first 4
amino-terminal residues of the NOP-selective peptide antagonist UFP-101,
a close derivative of N/OFQ, and provides important clues to the binding
of these peptides. The x-ray structure also shows substantial
conformational differences in the pocket regions between NOP and the
classical opioid receptors kappa (165196) and mu (600018), and these are
probably due to a small number of residues that vary between these
receptors. The NOP-C-24 structure explains the divergent selectivity
profile of NOP and provides a structural template for the design of NOP
ligands.

609699	TITLE *609699 MONOGLYCERIDE LIPASE; MGLL
;;MGL;;
MONOACYLGLYCEROL LIPASE; MAGL;;
HUK5
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Monoglyceride lipase (MGLL; EC 3.1.1.23) functions together with
hormone-sensitive lipase (LIPE; 151750) to hydrolyze intracellular
triglyceride stores in adipocytes and other cells to fatty acids and
glycerol. MGLL may also complement lipoprotein lipase (LPL; 238600) in
completing hydrolysis of monoglycerides resulting from degradation of
lipoprotein triglycerides (Karlsson et al., 2001).

CLONING

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to a
lysophospholipase gene from ectromelia virus, Wall et al. (1997)
identified human MGLL, which they designated HUK5. The deduced 313-amino
acid protein shares 49.5% identity with the virus protein. Database
analysis indicated that MGLL is expressed in wide variety of tissues and
may be preferentially expressed in adipose.

By RT-PCR of adipocyte total RNA using primers based on mouse Mgl,
followed by screening an adipocyte cDNA library, Karlsson et al. (2001)
cloned human MGL. The deduced 303-amino acid protein shares 84% identity
with mouse Mgl. Mouse and human MGL both have an N-terminal his-gly
dipeptide, a characteristic of lipases, and a catalytic triad of ser122,
asp239, and his269. By EST database analysis, Karlsson et al. (2001)
identified mouse and human MGL transcripts containing 2 different
5-prime leader sequences. Northern blot analysis of human adipocyte
total RNA detected a 4.2-kb MGL transcript. MGL expression was also
detected in lung, liver, kidney, brain, and heart. Western blot analysis
of mouse tissues showed ubiquitous expression, but the pattern was
tissue specific with regard to both the size and number of Mgl proteins.

GENE FUNCTION

Dinh et al. (2002) found that rat Mgl participates in inactivation of
2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), an endogenous cannabinoid monoglyceride.
Mgl was highly expressed in regions of rat brain that also expressed
cannabinoid receptors (see CNR1; 114610), and it appeared to assume a
presynaptic localization in hippocampus. Adenovirus-mediated transfer of
Mgl cDNA into rat cortical neurons increased Mgl expression and
attenuated 2-AG accumulation induced by N-methyl-D-aspartate/carbachol.

Nomura et al. (2010) found that KIAA1363 (NCEH1; 613234) and MAGL were
consistently elevated in aggressive human cancer cells relative to their
nonaggressive counterparts. The authors suggested that enrichment of
protumorigenic lipid signaling molecules in aggressive cancer cells
supports their malignant phenotype.

Nomura et al. (2011) demonstrated that a distinct pathway exists in
brain, where MAGL hydrolyzes the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol
to generate a major arachidonate precursor pool for neuroinflammatory
prostaglandins. MAGL-disrupted animals showed neuroprotection in a
parkinsonian mouse model. These animals were spared the hemorrhaging
caused by COX inhibitors in the gut, where prostaglandins are instead
regulated by cytosolic phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2); see 611651). Nomura
et al. (2011) concluded that their findings identified MAGL as a
distinct metabolic node that couples endocannabinoid to prostaglandin
signaling networks in the nervous system.

GENE STRUCTURE

Karlsson et al. (2001) determined that the mouse and human MGLL genes
contain 7 exons. Exon 1 is noncoding.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Analysis Consortium mapped the MGLL
gene to chromosome 3 (TMAP SHGC-31856).

Karlsson et al. (2001) mapped the mouse Mgll gene to a region of
chromosome 6 that shares homology of synteny with human chromosome 3q21.

606406	TITLE *606406 NUCLEAR PORE COMPLEX-INTERACTING PROTEIN; NPIP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Ohno (1970) observed that gene duplication followed by adaptive
evolution is a primary force for the emergence of new gene function.
Johnson et al. (2001) described such a proliferative event in a 20-kb
duplicated segment termed LCR16a (low-copy repeat sequence 'a' from
chromosome 16) that occurred after the divergence of humans and African
apes from Old World monkeys. Whereas 1 or 2 copies of the segment could
be found in baboons, there are 9, 17, 15, and 25 to 30 copies in
orangutans, gorillas, humans, and chimpanzees, respectively. Within this
segment, Johnson et al. (2001) identified the NPIP gene by genomic
sequence analysis and yeast 2-hybrid screening. The deduced 347-amino
acid NPIP protein is membrane bound. Immunofluorescence microscopy
demonstrated localization of NPIP to the nuclear membrane and
colocalization with nucleoporin p62 (NUP62; 605815). Johnson et al.
(2001) suggested that the existence of genes that have recently (within
the last 30 million years) duplicated and have rapidly evolved may
account for 5 to 7% of all human sequences, and they may lack definitive
orthologs in the genomes of model organisms.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Johnson et al. (2001) determined that the
NPIP gene contains 8 exons.

MAPPING

Johnson et al. (2001) mapped the NPIP gene to 16p13.1 by FISH. The
localization was confirmed for other hominoid species and extended to
chromosomes 7 and 17 in both chimpanzees and bonobos, while in
orangutans Npip is found on chromosomes 16 and 13.

300574	TITLE *300574 CHEMOKINE, CXC MOTIF, RECEPTOR 3; CXCR3
;;G PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTOR 9; GPR9;;
CD183 ANTIGEN; CD183
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Chemokines mediate migration of immune cells into infected or inflamed
tissues to initiate effective immune responses. The chemokine receptor
CXCR3 is preferentially expressed by T helper-1 (Th1) cells and is
critically involved in their recruitment to inflamed tissue. Tissue
infiltration of T cells expressing high levels of CXCR3 depends on
interferon-gamma (IFNG; 147570)-induced release of the CXCR3 ligands
CXCL9 (601704), CXCL10 (147310), or CXCL11 (604852). CXCR3 is also
expressed on nonlymphoid tissue-homing CD4 (186940)-positive/CD25
(IL2RA; 147730)-positive regulatory T (Treg) cells (summary by Erhardt
et al., 2011).

CLONING

A wide spectrum of intercellular signals is mediated by peptide ligands
interacting with specific cell surface receptors. Many peptide-binding
receptors belong to the G protein-coupled receptor family and exhibit
common structural features, including the presence of 7 transmembrane
domains and a number of conserved amino acid residues. Marchese et al.
(1995) used PCR and genomic DNA library screening to clone 2 novel human
genes, GPR9 and GPR10 (600895), and a rat gene, GPR14 (600896). Each of
these encodes a G protein-coupled receptor. The receptor encoded by GPR9
was found to share the highest identity with human IL8 receptor type B
(IL8RB; 146928) (38% overall and 53% in the transmembrane regions),
followed by IL8RA (146929) (36% overall and 51% in the transmembrane
domains).

By database analysis and 5-prime and 3-prime RACE of total mRNA from
human microvascular endothelial cells and thymus, Lasagni et al. (2003)
cloned a novel CXCR3 splice variant that they termed CXCR3B. The
predicted CXCR3B protein contains 416 amino acids and has a longer N
terminus that differs from the original 368-amino acid CXCR3 protein,
CXCR3A, in the first 52 residues. Northern blot analysis detected CXCR3A
and CXCR3B transcripts of 1.6 and 1.8 kb, respectively, in heart,
kidney, liver, and skeletal muscle, with CXCR3A predominating. CXCR3A
was also present in placenta.

GENE FUNCTION

The superfamily of chemokines consists of an array of chemoattractant
proteins that has been divided into 4 branches (C, CC, CXC, and CXXC) on
the basis of the relative position of the cysteine residues in the
mature protein. Structural variants of chemokines are associated with
differences in their ability to regulate the trafficking of immune cells
during hematopoiesis and inflammatory responses. Chemokines exert their
attractant properties after binding to distinct membrane receptors.
Because a single chemokine receptor binds several chemokines, it is
often difficult to evaluate the activity of these structures in
lymphocyte homing. For instance, interferon (IFN)-inducible protein-10
(IP10, or CXCL10; 147310) and IFN-gamma-induced monokine-2 (MIG, or
CXCL9; 601704), CXC chemokines that are induced by IFN-gamma, bind the
CXCR3 receptor and are shown to be specifically chemotactic for
activated lymphocytes (Loetscher et al., 1996).

Although FACS analysis demonstrated that 40% of resting T lymphocytes
expressed CXCR3, Loetscher et al. (1998) found that these cells did not
have detectable CXCR3 transcripts and did not respond to CXCL9 or
CXCL10. However, exposure to IL2 (147680) with or without mitogen for 2
weeks resulted in expression of CXCR3 on more than 95% of T lymphocytes.

Using Northern blot analysis, Bonecchi et al. (1998) showed that
polarized Th1 cells preferentially express CXCR3 and CCR5 (601373). In
contrast, Th2 cells preferentially express CCR4 (604836) and, at least
in a subpopulation of Th2 cells, CCR3 (601268).

Trentin et al. (1999) investigated the expression and function of CXCR3
on normal and malignant B cells from 65 patients with chronic
lymphoproliferative disorders. Although CXCR3 was lacking in CD5(+) and
CD5(-) B cells from healthy subjects, it was expressed on leukemic B
lymphocytes from all (31/31) patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia
(CLL). The presence of CXCR3 was heterogeneous in other B-cell
disorders, being expressed in 2 of 7 patients with mantle cell lymphoma
(MCL), 4 of 12 patients with hairy cell leukemia (HCL), and 11 of 15
patients with other subtypes of non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs). Chemotaxis
assay showed that normal B cells from healthy subjects did not migrate
in response to IP10 and MIG. In contrast, a definite migration in
response to IP10 and MIG was observed in all malignant B cells from
patients with CLL, but not in patients with HCL or MCL. Neoplastic B
cells from other NHLs showed a heterogeneous pattern. The migration
elicited by IP10 and MIG was inhibited by blocking CXCR3. No effect of
IP10 and MIG chemokines was observed on the cytosolic calcium
concentration in malignant B cells. The data demonstrated that CXCR3 is
expressed on malignant B cells from chronic lymphoproliferative
disorders, particularly in patients with CLL, and represents a fully
functional receptor involved in chemotaxis of malignant B lymphocytes.

Using bronchoalveolar lavage and flow cytometry, Campbell et al. (2001)
determined that T lymphocytes homing to the lung in both normal and
asthmatic subjects express CCR5 and CXCR3 but not CCR9 (604738), which
is found on T cells homing to intestinal mucosal sites, or CLA (see
SELPLG; 600738), which is found on skin-homing T cells.

Frigerio et al. (2002) demonstrated that in response to inflammation,
beta cells secrete the chemokine CXC ligand-10 (CXCL10; 147310) and CXC
ligand-9 (CXCL9; 601704), which specifically attract T-effector cells
via CXCR3. In mice deficient for this receptor, the onset of type 1
diabetes (222100) is substantially delayed. Thus, Frigerio et al. (2002)
concluded that in the absence of known etiologic agents, CXCR3
represents a novel target for therapeutic interference early in type 1
diabetes.

Using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, Booth et al. (2002)
showed that IP10 (CXCL10) interacted with the N terminus of CXCR3 via a
hydrophobic cleft formed by the N-loop and 40s-loop region of IP10,
similar to the interaction surface of other chemokines, such as IL8
(146930). An additional region of interaction was found that consisted
of a hydrophobic cleft formed by the N terminus and the 30s loop of
IP10.

Lasagni et al. (2003) found that both CXCR3A and CXCR3B bound CXCL9,
CXCL10, and CXCL11 (604852), but only CXCR3B bound CXCL4 (PF4; 173460),
following expression in a microvascular endothelial cell line.
Overexpression of CXCR3A induced an increase in endothelial cell
survival, whereas overexpression of CXCR3B upregulated apoptotic
pathways. Immunohistochemical analysis of primary microvascular
endothelial cells, whose growth in inhibited by CXCL4, CXCL9, CXCL10,
and CXCL11, demonstrated expression of CXCR3B, but not CXCR3A.
CXCR3B-specific monoclonal antibodies reacted with neoplastic tissue
endothelial cells, providing evidence that CXCR3B is expressed in vivo
and may account for the angiostatic effects of CXC chemokines.

Although chemokine signaling is often promiscuous, signaling events
between members of the distinct chemokine classes (CXC, CC, CX3C, and C)
are almost never observed. Dijkstra et al. (2004) showed that human
CCL21 (602737), in the absence of its primary receptor, CCR7 (600242),
is a functional ligand for CXCR3, inducing chemotaxis in adult
microglial cells, but not in kidney epithelial cells. CCL21-induced
chemotaxis could be inhibited by the CXCR3 ligand, CXCL10, whereas
CXCL10 had no effect on CX3CL1 (601880) chemotactic activity.
Fluorescence microscopy demonstrated that CXCR3 was expressed
predominantly in microglial cytoplasm. Dijkstra et al. (2004) concluded
that CCL21 signaling through CXCR3 depends on the cellular background in
which CXCR3 is expressed.

Using microarray analysis, Feferman et al. (2005) found increased
expression of Cxl10 and its receptor, Cxcr3, in lymph node cells of rats
with experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis (MG; 254200). Real-time
RT-PCR, FACS, and immunohistochemistry analyses confirmed these findings
and revealed upregulated expression of another Cxcr3 chemoattractant,
Cxcl9, and of Tnf (191160) and Il1b (147720), which act synergistically
with Ifng (147570) to induce Cxcl10, in both lymph node cells and muscle
of myasthenic rats. Upregulation of these genes was reduced after
mucosal tolerance induction with an AChR (see CHRNA1; 100725) fragment.
Using RT-PCR, flow cytometric, and fluorescence microscopy analyses,
Feferman et al. (2005) found increased expression of CXL10 and CXCR3 in
thymus and muscle of MG patients compared with age-matched controls,
validating their findings in the rat model of MG. They concluded that
CXCL10/CXCR3 signaling is associated with MG pathogenesis and proposed
that CXCL10 and CXCR3 may serve as novel drug targets to treat MG.

Oo et al. (2010) found that 18% of T cells in inflamed areas of diseased
human livers expressed the Treg marker FOXP3 (300292). Flow cytometric
analysis showed that inflamed liver Tregs expressed higher levels of
CCR4 and CXCR3 compared with blood Tregs. Adhesion assays showed that
Tregs used CXCR3 and alpha-4 (ITGA4; 192975)/beta-1 (ITGB1; 135630) to
bind and transmigrate, whereas CCR4 played no role. The CCR4 ligands
CCL17 (601520) and CCL22 (602957) were absent from healthy liver, but
they were expressed by dendritic cells in inflamed liver, and these
dendritic cells were associated with CD8 T cells and CCR4-positive Tregs
in the parenchyma and septal areas. Ex vivo, liver-derived Tregs
migrated to CCR4 ligands secreted by dendritic cells. Oo et al. (2010)
proposed that CXCR3 mediates recruitment of Tregs via hepatic sinusoidal
endothelium and that dendritic cells secrete CCR4 ligands that recruit
Tregs to sites of inflammation in patients with chronic hepatitis.

By binding analyses, Struyf et al. (2011) found that human CXCL4L1
(PF4V1; 173461), a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis, had lower affinity
for heparin and chondroitin sulfate-E than did CXCL4 and that CXCL10 and
CXCL4L1 could displace each other on human microvascular endothelial
cells. CXCL4L1 bound to both CXCR3A and CXCR3B. Antibodies to CXCR3
blocked CXCL4L1 antiangiogenic activity, and human CXCL4L1 activity was
reduced in mice treated with anti-human CXCR3 or in mice lacking Cxcr3,
as assessed by tumor growth and vascularization of Lewis lung carcinoma.
Like CXCL4, CXCL4L1 attracted activated T, natural killer, and dendritic
cells, but preincubation with CXCL10 and CXCL11, pertussis toxin, or
anti-CXCR3 reduced or neutralized this activity. Struyf et al. (2011)
concluded that CXCR3A and CXCR3B are involved in the chemotactic and
vascular effects of CXCL4L1.

Endo et al. (2011) examined expression of cell surface markers to
identify functionally distinct subpopulations of mouse memory Th2 cells.
FACS analysis demonstrated 4 Th2 subpopulations based on high or low
expression levels of Cd62l (SELL; 153240) and Cxcr3. All 4
subpopulations produced comparable levels of Il4 (147780) and Il13
(147683), but Th2 cells expressing low levels of both Cd62l and Cxcr3
(Cd62l-lo/Cxcr3-lo cells) selectively produced Il5 (147850). Il5
production in Cd62l-lo/Cxcr3-lo cells was accompanied by histone H3-K4
methylation, a marker for the permissive conformation of chromatin, at
the IL5 promoter. DNA microarray analysis and quantitative RT-PCR showed
that Cd44 (107269)-positive memory Th2 cells expressing Il5 had lower
levels of Eomes (604615) and Tbx21 (604895) and higher levels of Rora
(600825) and Pparg (601487) than memory Th2 cells lacking Il5
expression. RNA silencing demonstrated that Eomes downregulation was
required for Il5 expression and that Eomes had no effect on H3-K4
methylation at the Il5 promoter. Instead Eomes suppressed Gata3 (131320)
transcriptional activity by inhibiting Gata3 binding to the Il5
promoter. Depletion of Cd62l-lo/Cxcr3-lo cells ameliorated memory Th2
cell-dependent airway inflammation in mice. Endo et al. (2011) concluded
that IL5 production preferentially occurs in the CD62L-lo/CXCR3-lo
subpopulation regulated by EOMES expression.

GENE STRUCTURE

Marchese et al. (1995) determined that GPR10 and GPR14 are intronless
within their coding regions, while GPR9 contains at least 1 intron.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Marchese et al. (1995) mapped the
GPR9 gene to 8p12-p11.2 and the GPR10 gene to 10q25.3-q26. Using FISH,
PCR, and Southern blot analysis, Loetscher et al. (1998) determined that
CXCR3 is a single-copy gene that maps to chromosome Xq13. The
International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium confirmed that the
CXCR3 gene maps to the X chromosome (TMAP RH47042).

ANIMAL MODEL

Liu et al. (2006) noted that mice lacking the Cxcr3 ligand Cxcl10
exhibit enhanced susceptibility to experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model for certain aspects of multiple
sclerosis (MS; 126200). They found that EAE in mice lacking Cxcr3 was
characterized by exaggerated severity, aggravated blood-brain barrier
disruption, and increased tissue damage, accompanied by reduced
production of Ifng and impaired expression of inducible nitric oxide
synthase (NOS2A; 163730), compared with wildtype mice with EAE. However,
immunohistochemical, microscopic, and flow cytometric analyses
demonstrated a lack of quantitative and qualitative differences in
leukocytes infiltrating the central nervous system between Cxcr3 -/- and
wildtype mice with EAE. Liu et al. (2006) concluded that Cxcl10 is the
most relevant Cxcr3 ligand in EAE, and that Cxcr3 does not govern
leukocyte trafficking in EAE, but modulates Ifng production and
downstream events affecting disease severity.

Using a mouse model of immune-mediated liver injury induced by
concanavalin A (ConA), Erhardt et al. (2011) demonstrated enhanced
intrahepatic expression of the Cxcr3 ligands Cxcl9, Cxcl10, and Cxcl11
following induction of ConA hepatitis. Cxcr3 -/- mice developed more
severe liver injury with higher plasma transaminase activities and a
more pronounced Th1/Th17 response compared with wildtype mice after ConA
treatment. In addition, Cxcr3 -/- mice did not establish tolerance upon
ConA restimulation, although Tregs from Cxcr3 -/- mice were still
immunosuppressive in an in vitro suppression assay. However, there was
no accumulation of Cxcr3-positive/Tbet (TBX21; 604895)-positive Tregs
producing Il10 (124092) in liver of Cxcr3 -/- mice, as there was in
wildtype mice. Conversion to Tregs was dependent on a Th1 response, as
Ifng-deficient mice failed to produce Cxcr3-positive/Tbet-positive
Tregs. Cd25-positive/Foxp3-positive Tregs failed to protect against
ConA-induced hepatitis, whereas Cxcr3-positive/Tbet-positive Tregs
protected Cxcr3 -/- mice and allowed recovery from injury. Erhardt et
al. (2011) concluded that CXCR3-positive/TBET-positive/IL10-positive
Tregs are generated in liver in an IFNG-dependent manner, then
disseminate into the organism and migrate to liver, where they limit
immune-mediated damage.

Wuest and Carr (2008) found that corneal infection with herpes simplex
virus-1 (HSV1) resulted in elevated viral titers in the nervous system
of Cxcl10 -/- mice, which correlated with defects in leukocyte
recruitment to the brainstem. Similar levels of HSV1 were recovered from
Cxcl10 -/- or wildtype mice lacking natural killer (NK) cells or
virus-specific Cd8 (see 186910)-positive T cells. Cxcr3 -/- mice also
had poor recruitment of NK cells, but not Cd8-positive cells. Wuest and
Carr (2008) concluded that antigen-specific CD8-positive T cells,
recruited through CXCL10, are critical in the antiviral response at the
brainstem.

611009	TITLE *611009 MEX3, C. ELEGANS, HOMOLOG OF, D; MEX3D
;;RING FINGER- AND KH DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1; RKHD1;;
TINO;;
KIAA2031
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By yeast 3-hybrid screening of a placenta cDNA library using an AU-rich
element (ARE) of BCL2 (151430) as bait, Donnini et al. (2004) obtained a
partial cDNA encoding RKHD1, which they called TINO. The predicted
490-amino acid partial protein has 2 N-terminal ribonucleoprotein K
(HNRNPK; 600712) homology (KH) domains and a C-terminal RING domain, and
it shares similarity with C. elegans Mex3. Donnini et al. (2004) also
identified a partial cDNA, KIAA2031, that may represent a TINO splice
variant. RACE and database analyses suggested that the full-length TINO
protein contains 651 amino acids. Northern blot analysis detected a
3.1-kb transcript in all tissues examined, with highest expression in
placenta. A 6.5-kb transcript was also present in heart and skeletal
muscle. Immunofluorescence analysis of HeLa cells localized endogenous
TINO predominantly in the nucleus and perinuclear region.

C. elegans Mex3 is a regulator of translation that specifies posterior
blastomere identity in the early embryo and contributes to the
maintenance of germline totipotency. By database analysis and RT-PCR,
Buchet-Poyau et al. (2007) cloned a family of 4 human genes homologous
to C. elegans Mex3, including RKHD1, which they called MEX3D. Like the
other human MEX3 proteins, the deduced 651-amino acid MEX3D protein has
an N-terminal nuclear export signal (NES), 2 KH domains, and a
C-terminal RING finger domain. The KH domains are present in C. elegans
Mex3, but not the RING domain. RT-PCR detected ubiquitous expression of
MEX3D in human tissues and cell lines.

GENE FUNCTION

Using yeast 3-hybrid and gel-shift assays, Donnini et al. (2004) showed
that TINO interacted with an ARE of BCL2 in vitro and in vivo. Upon
binding, TINO destabilized a chimeric reporter construct containing the
BCL2 ARE, revealing a negative regulatory action on BCL2 expression at
the posttranscriptional level.

GENE STRUCTURE

Donnini et al. (2004) determined that the RKHD1 gene contains 3 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Donnini et al. (2004) mapped the MEX3D
gene to chromosome 19p13.3.

;;FBX24
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the F-box protein family, such as FBXO24, are characterized
by an approximately 40-amino acid F-box motif. SCF complexes, formed by
SKP1 (601434), cullin (see CUL1; 603134), and F-box proteins, act as
protein-ubiquitin ligases. F-box proteins interact with SKP1 through the
F box, and they interact with ubiquitination targets through other
protein interaction domains (Jin et al., 2004).

CLONING

Jin et al. (2004) reported that the FBXO24 protein contains a central F
box and a C-terminal RCC1 (179710) fold.

MAPPING

Jin et al. (2004) stated that the FBXO24 gene maps to chromosome 7q22
and the mouse Fbxo24 gene maps to chromosome 5G2.

611562	TITLE *611562 SEPTIN 12; SEPT12
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Septins, such as SEPT12, are conserved GTP-binding proteins that
function as dynamic, regulatable scaffolds for the recruitment of other
proteins. They are involved in membrane dynamics, vesicle trafficking,
apoptosis, and cytoskeleton remodeling, as well as infection,
neurodegeneration, and neoplasia (Hall et al., 2005).

CLONING

By searching databases for members of the septin family, Hall et al.
(2005) identified SEPT12. DNA microarray analysis showed low expression
of SEPT12 in all normal, diseased, and cancer tissues examined.

Using microarray analysis to identify genes downregulated in testis of
men with spermatocyte maturation arrest (see 270960) or Sertoli
cell-only syndrome (see 400042), followed by database analysis, Lin et
al. (2006) identified SEPT12. The deduced protein contains 358 amino
acids. RT-PCR of 8 human tissues detected SEPT12 expression in testis
only. In mouse tissues, highest Sept12 expression was detected in testis
and ovary, with weaker expression in lung, kidney, and uterus. In mouse
testis, 2 Sept12 transcripts were detected at postnatal day 1 and
increased in abundance until adulthood.

Steels et al. (2007) stated that 2 SEPT12 transcripts that differ in the
presence or absence of exon 4 exist in humans and other mammals. Both
protein isoforms contain consensus GTP-binding motifs, a polybasic
domain, and a septin unique element, but they lack a C-terminal
coiled-coil sequence found in other septins. RT-PCR identified the
transcript containing exon 4 as the major Sept12 variant in rat testis,
and Western blot analysis confirmed this finding at the protein level.
Immunohistochemical analysis of adult rat sperm revealed localization of
Sept12 in a ring structure demarcating the end of the mitochondrial
sheath. During cytokinesis in transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)
cells, fluorescence-tagged rat Sept12 localized to the actomyosin
cleavage apparatus in the cleavage furrow.

By immunofluorescence analysis of human spermatozoa, Lin et al. (2011)
found that SEPT12 concentrated around the acrosome in the first step of
spermiogenesis. With the formation of mitochondria and mature
spermatozoa, SEPT12 localized at the neck and annulus region.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lin et al. (2006) determined that the SEPT12 gene contains at least 10
exons and spans about 16 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Hall et al. (2005) mapped the SEPT12 gene
to chromosome 16p13.3.

Lin et al. (2006) reported that the mouse Sept12 gene maps to chromosome
16A1.

GENE FUNCTION

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Steels et al. (2007) found that the short
isoform of human SEPT12 and the long isoform of rat Sept12
self-associated. Both isoforms bound all rat and human septins tested
except rat Sept3 (608314) and human SEPT9 (604061), with which SEPT12
shares highest similarity, and human SEPT10, which exhibits nuclear
localization. The interactions depended upon the ability of septins to
coordinate guanine nucleotide. Both SEPT12 isoforms bound guanine
nucleotides in a GDP:GTP ratio of approximately 2:1, but like other
septins, neither SEPT12 isoform showed measurable GDP-GTP exchange
activity. Both isoforms also bound phosphoinositides, with preference
for monophosphorylated phosphoinositides, and phosphatidylserine. When
expressed in CHO cells, rat Sept12 formed short linear filaments and
cytoplasmic aggregates. However, upon coexpression, rat Sept12 and human
SEPT4 (603696) formed curved filaments.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Lin et al. (2012) analyzed the SEPT12 gene in 160 infertile men (SPGF10;
614822) and 200 fertile controls and identified a variant (474G-A;
611562.0001) that was significantly more prevalent in infertile men than
controls. Nine of 15 men homozygous for the 474A allele had
teratozoospermia, and their sperm showed a bent tail and a decondensed
nucleus with significant DNA damage. Transfection studies showed that
mutant SEPT12 disrupted filament formation of wildtype SEPT in a
dose-dependent manner.

Kuo et al. (2012) analyzed the SEPT12 gene in 160 infertile men and
identified 2 heterozygous missense mutations, 1 in a man with
asthenoteratozoospermia and 1 in a man with oligoasthenozoospermia
(611562.0002, 611562.0003). Functional analysis demonstrated that both
mutations adversely affected filament formation of wildtype SEPT12 in a
dose-dependent manner. Characteristics of abnormal sperm included a
defective annulus with a bent tail and loss of SEPT12 from the annulus.

ANIMAL MODEL

Lin et al. (2011) found that Sept12 +/- male mice were sterile due to
severe spermatogenic defects, including immotility, bent tail, rounded
head, and acrosomal defects. Sept12 +/- sperm showed a reduced rate of
fertilization in vitro, and the resultant embryos failed to develop past
the morula stage.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
SPERMATOGENIC FAILURE 10, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
SEPT12, 474G-A

Lin et al. (2012) analyzed the SEPT12 gene in 160 infertile men (SPGF10;
614822) and 200 fertile controls and identified a 474G-A transition in
exon 5, within the GTP-binding domain, that was more prevalent in
infertile men than controls in both allele (p = 0.007) and genotype (p =
0.003) frequencies. Sequence analysis showed that the G-to-A transition
created a novel splice donor site that resulted in skipping of 41 bp in
the 3-prime portion of exon 5, causing a frameshift and a premature
termination codon in exon 6. Transfection studies in NT2D1 cells
overexpressing SEPT12 showed that wildtype SEPT12 formed filaments
surrounding the nuclear membrane whereas mutant SEPT12 aggregated to
form a dot-like structure that did not surround the nuclear periphery.
Similarly, immunofluorescence assay in spermatozoa from fertile men
demonstrated the presence of SEPT12 around the nuclear periphery of
round spermatids, at the neck region of elongating spermatids, and at
the neck region and annulus of mature spermatozoa, whereas in infertile
men with 474A/A, SEPT12 showed a dot-like pattern in different stages of
haploid germ cells. Mutant SEPT12 was also observed to disrupt the
filament formation of wildtype SEPT12 in a dose-dependent manner.
Examination of sperm from 474A/A infertile men by transmission electron
microscopy showed a loose nuclear matrix; narrow head and decondensed
nuclear matrix was observed under atomic force microscopy.

SPERMATOGENIC FAILURE 10, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
SEPT12, THR89MET

In a 36-year-old infertile male with spermatogenic failure (SPGF10;
614822), Kuo et al. (2012) identified heterozygosity for a 266C-T
transition in exon 3 of the SEPT12 gene, resulting in a thr89-to-met
(T89M) substitution at a highly conserved residue in the switch I motif
of the GTPase domain. The patient had asthenoteratozoospermia, with a
sperm count of 20.5 x 10(6)/ml, morphology that was 92% abnormal, and a
total motility of 48%. The mutation was not found in 200 fertile men
with normal semen parameters. Functional analysis demonstrated that the
T89M mutant had significantly reduced GTP hydrolytic activity and
restricted filament formation of wildtype SEPT12 in a dose-dependent
manner.

.0003
SPERMATOGENIC FAILURE 10, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
SEPT12, ASP197ASN

In a 33-year-old infertile male with spermatogenic failure (SPGF10;
614822), Kuo et al. (2012) identified heterozygosity for a 589G-A
transition in exon 6 of the SEPT12 gene, resulting in an asp197-to-asn
(D197N) substitution at a highly conserved residue in the
guanine-recognition site of the GTPase domain. The patient had
oligoasthenozoospermia, with a sperm count of 0.9 x 10(6)/ml, morphology
that was 80% abnormal, and a total motility of 22%. The mutation was not
found in 200 fertile men with normal semen parameters. Functional
analysis demonstrated that D197N mutant interfered with GTP binding and
restricted filament formation of wildtype SEPT12 in a dose-dependent
manner. Immunofluorescence staining showed that about 56% of the
patient's abnormal sperm did not show a SEPT12 signal, compared to only
about 15% of abnormal-appearing sperm from fertile men. In the patient,
loss of annulus SEPT12 or SEPT4 (603696) signals were observed in sperm
with abnormal morphology, indicating that SEPT12 interacts with SEPT4 to
form a septin protein complex at the annulus. Some D197N sperm contained
a deformed tail with reduced diameter at the midpiece-principal piece
junction (annulus site).

602415	TITLE *602415 DYSTROBREVIN, BETA; DTNB
DESCRIPTION Dystrophin, a component of muscle that is defective in Duchenne muscular
dystrophy (DMD; 310200), binds to a complex of proteins and
glycoproteins, the dystrophin-associated protein complex (DPC), which
effectively forms a transmembrane link between the extracellular matrix,
and the cytoskeleton of the muscle fiber. The DPC can be divided into 3
subcomplexes: the dystroglycan complex, the sarcoglycan complex, and the
cytoplasmic complex. The dystroglycan complex consists of 2 proteins,
alpha- and beta-dystroglycan (DAG1, DAG2;128239), that bind to laminin
and dystrophin, respectively. The sarcoglycan complex is composed of 4
transmembrane glycoproteins: alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and
delta-sarcoglycan, and a 25-kD protein 25DAP. Mutations in all 4
sarcoglycan genes have been found in patients with different forms of
limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. The cytoplasmic component of the DPC is
composed of the syntrophin family of related proteins and the
dystrophin-related protein, dystrobrevin. Peters et al. (1997) described
beta-dystrobrevin. They cloned cDNAs from human liver libraries that
encode a 627-amino acid polypeptide with a predicted molecular weight of
71 kD. The protein copurified with the dystrobrevin short form, Dp71.

The mammalian dystrobrevin genes encode several protein isoforms that
are expressed in different tissues, including brain and muscle. Blake et
al. (1998) designated the isoform expressed in muscle as
alpha-dystrobrevin and used the designation beta-dystrobrevin for the
dystrophin-related protein they found to be abundantly expressed in
brain and other tissues but not in muscle. Beta-dystrobrevin is encoded
by a 2.5-kb alternatively spliced transcript that is found throughout
the brain. In common with dystrophin, beta-dystrobrevin is found in
neurons of the cortex and hippocampal formation, but it is not found in
the brain microvasculature. In the brain, beta-dystrobrevin
coprecipitates with the dystrophin isoforms Dp71 and Dp140. The findings
of Blake et al. (1998) indicated that the composition of the
dystrophin-associated protein complex in the brain differs from that in
muscle. Because beta-dystrobrevin and dystrophin are expressed in
similar populations of neurons in the hippocampus and cortex, it is
possible that beta-dystrobrevin interacts directly with dystrophin. If
this is the case, then beta-dystrobrevin levels may be reduced in DMD
patients similar to the reduction in sarcolemmal staining seen with
other components of the DPC in dystrophic muscle. The findings may be
relevant to the cognitive dysfunction affecting many patients with
Duchenne muscular dystrophy.

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Peters et al. (1997) mapped the
DTNB gene to human 2p23-p22. The short arm of human chromosome 2 shows
homology of synteny with the most proximal 15 cM of mouse chromosome 12.
Loh et al. (1998) assigned the mouse beta-dystrobrevin gene (Dtnb) to
chromosome 12 by backcross mapping. They found that the mouse gene
contains 21 exons spanning over 130 kb of DNA.

609024	TITLE *609024 KDEL ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM PROTEIN RETENTION RECEPTOR 2; KDELR2
;;ERD2-LIKE PROTEIN 1; ELP1;;
ERD2.2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Resident soluble proteins within the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum
(ER) are retained there by virtue of a C-terminal tetrapeptide ER
retention signal, commonly lys-asp-glu-leu (KDEL) in mammals. KDELR2 is
one of the receptors that cycle between the Golgi apparatus and the ER,
returning proteins containing the KDEL signal to the ER (Lewis and
Pelham, 1992).

CLONING

By screening cDNA libraries with a KDELR1 (131235) sequence, followed by
5-prime RACE of a Burkitt lymphoma cell line cDNA library, Lewis and
Pelham (1992) cloned KDELR2, which they designated ERD2.2. The deduced
212-amino acid protein contains 7 transmembrane domains and shares 83.5%
identity with KDELR1, with most differences between the 2 receptors in
the transmembrane spans.

Using degenerate PCR primers designed from a conserved region of KDELR1
to amplify related cDNAs from an erythroleukemia cell line cDNA library,
followed by screening a T-cell cDNA library, Hsu et al. (1992) cloned
KDELR2, which they called ELP1. The deduced 214-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 24.6 kD. Northern blot analysis detected a
KDELR2 transcript of about 1.2 kb.

GENE FUNCTION

Lewis and Pelham (1992) observed that KDELR2 transfected into COS-7
cells accumulated predominantly in the Golgi complex, but when the
receptor was coexpressed with a target protein containing the KDEL ER
retention signal, it redistributed to the ER, mirroring the behavior of
KDELR1 under the same conditions.

Hsu et al. (1992) found that about half of KDELR1- or KDELR2-transfected
COS cells expressed the receptors in a juxtanuclear, Golgi-like pattern,
while the remainder showed a reticular, ER-like pattern with nuclear
envelope staining. Overexpression of the KDEL receptors led to the
ER-like pattern and was associated with the collapse of the Golgi
apparatus into the ER, as seen in cells treated with brefeldin A. In
addition to the loss of the Golgi apparatus as a distinct organelle,
overexpression resulted in redistribution of the Golgi coat protein,
beta-COP (COPB; 600959), to the cytosol, addition of complex
oligosaccharides to resident ER glycoproteins, and blockage of
anterograde traffic. Hsu et al. (1992) concluded that the KDEL receptors
provide signals that regulate retrograde traffic between the Golgi and
the ER.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the KDELR2
gene to chromosome 7 (TMAP SHGC-55953).
