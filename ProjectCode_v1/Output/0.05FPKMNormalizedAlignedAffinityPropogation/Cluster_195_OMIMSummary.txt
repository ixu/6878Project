DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) is a lipid kinase that
phosphorylates the inositol ring of phosphatidylinositol and related
compounds at the 3-prime position. The products of these reactions serve
as second messengers in growth signaling pathways. The kinase itself is
made up of a catalytic subunit of molecular mass 110 kD (PIK3CA; 171834)
and a regulatory subunit of either 85 kD, 55 kD, or 50 kD. Otsu et al.
(1991) showed that the bovine PI3K p85 subunit consists of 2 closely
related proteins, p85-alpha (171833) and p85-beta. They cloned cDNAs
encoding both p85 subunits, each of which is 724 amino acids long. The
subunits share 62% amino acid identity across their entire length. Both
sequences contain an N-terminal SH3 region, 2 SH2 regions, and a region
of homology to BCR (151410).

Janssen et al. (1998) determined the human p85-beta cDNA sequence.

GENE FUNCTION

Functional expression studies by Otsu et al. (1991) showed that both
bovine p85 subunits bound tyrosine kinase receptors.

Hale et al. (2006) generated a laryngeal carcinoma cell line
constitutively expressing influenza A virus NS1 protein and found that
NS1 bound specifically to p85-beta. The NS1 protein from various
influenza strains also bound p85-beta, but not p85-alpha. Expression of
NS1 led to induction of PI3K signaling, including phosphorylation of AKT
(164730) at ser473. Binding of p85-beta and activation of PI3K required
tyr89 of NS1, and mutant viruses expressing NS1 with a tyr89-to-phe
substitution grew more slowly in cell culture than wildtype viruses.
Hale et al. (2006) proposed that activation of PI3K signaling in
influenza A virus-infected cells is important for efficient virus
replication.

Using mouse embryonic fibroblasts, Park et al. (2010) showed that, in
addition to regulating PI3K function, p85-alpha and p85-beta regulated
the function of Xbp1s (XBP1; 194355), a transcription factor that
orchestrates the unfolded protein response (UPR) following endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) stress. Both p85-alpha and p85-beta bound Xbp1s and
increased its nuclear translocation, and it appeared that the p110 PI3K
catalytic subunit and Xbp1s competed for binding of these regulatory
subunits. p85-alpha and p85-beta formed an inactive dimer that was
disrupted by insulin in a time-dependent manner, which promoted their
association with Xbp1s. Refeeding of wildtype mice after fasting induced
ER stress that was quickly resolved, as measured by Xbp1s levels. In
contrast, obese and insulin-resistant ob/ob (LEP; 164160) mice could not
resolve the ER stress induced during refeeding, and nuclear
translocation of Xbp1s was absent in ob/ob mice. Overexpression of
p85-alpha or p85-beta in livers of ob/ob mice increased glucose
tolerance and reduced blood glucose concentrations.

To assess the impact of the AKT3 (611223), PIK3R2, and PIK3CA mutations
in individuals with megalencephaly-capillary malformation-polymicrogyria
syndrome (MCAP; 602501) and megalencephaly polymicrogyria-polydactyly
hydrocephalus syndrome (MPPH; 603387) on PI3K activity, Riviere et al.
(2012) used immunostaining to compare PIP3 amounts in lymphoblastoid
cell lines derived from 4 mutation carriers with megalencephaly to those
in control and PTEN (601728)-mutant cells. Consistent with elevated PI3K
activity, and similar to what is seen with PTEN loss, all 3 lines with
PIK3R2 or PIK3CA mutations showed significantly more PIP3 staining than
control cells, as well as greater localization of active
phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDPK1; 605213) to the cell
membrane. Treatment with the PI3K inhibitor PI-103 resulted in less PIP3
in the PIK3R2 G373R (603157.0001) and PIK3CA E453del (171834.0014)
mutant lines, confirming that these results are PI3K-dependent. Riviere
et al. (2012) found no evidence for increased PI3K activity in the
AKT3-mutant line, consistent with a mutation affecting a downstream
effector of PI3K. Protein blot analysis showed higher amounts of
phosphorylated S6 protein and 4E-BP1 in all mutant cell lines compared
to controls. Although PI-103 treatment reduced S6 phosphorylation in
control and mutant lines, the latter showed relative resistance to PI3K
inhibition, consistent with elevated signaling through the pathway.
Riviere et al. (2012) concluded that the megalencephaly-associated
mutations result in higher PI3K activity and PI3K-mTOR signaling.

MAPPING

Volinia et al. (1992) used in situ hybridization to map the PIK3R2 gene
to human chromosome 19q13.2-q13.4.

CYTOGENETICS

Janssen et al. (1998) analyzed DNA from a patient with chronic
myeloproliferative disorder. They identified an oncogenic fusion of the
5-prime end of p85-beta and the 3-prime end of HUMORF8 (USP8; 603158).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Riviere et al. (2012) performed exome sequencing in the oldest of 3
affected sibs with MPPH and identified a heterozygous mutation in the
PIK3R2 gene (G373R; 603157.0001). Sanger sequencing confirmed the
presence of the mutation in all 3 affected sibs and its absence in the
saliva and blood of both parents and the unaffected sister, showing
germline mosaicism in 1 parent. Sequencing of the PIK3R2 gene in 40
individuals with megalencephaly identified the same nucleotide change in
10 additional subjects with MPPH, and this mutation was shown to be de
novo in all subjects for whom parental DNA was available. The mutation
occurred at a CpG dinucleotide, which might explain its recurrence.

ANIMAL MODEL

Oak et al. (2006) crossed mice with a floxed Pik3r1 allele and a null
Pik3r2 allele with Lck (153390)-Cre transgenic mice to generate a strain
in which class IA Pi3k expression and function were essentially
abrogated in T cells beginning at the double-negative stage.
Histopathologic analysis of these mice showed development of
organ-specific autoimmunity resembling Sjogren syndrome (SS; 270150). By
3 to 8 months of age, mutant mice developed corneal opacity and eye
lesions due to irritation and constant scratching. Mutant mice showed
marked lymphocytic infiltration of lacrimal glands and serum antinuclear
and anti-Ssa (SSA1; 109092) antibodies, but no kidney pathology.
Cd4-positive T cells, which were the predominant infiltrating cells in
lacrimal glands of mutant mice, exhibited aberrant differentiation in
vitro. Oak et al. (2006) concluded that impaired class IA PI3K signaling
in T cells can lead to organ-specific autoimmunity, and they proposed
that class IA Pi3k-deficient mice manifest the cardinal features of
human primary SS.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MEGALENCEPHALY-POLYMICROGYRIA-POLYDACTYLY-HYDROCEPHALUS SYNDROME
PIK3R2, GLY373ARG

In 13 individuals with
megalencephaly-polymicrogyria-polydactyly-hydrocephalus syndrome (MPPH;
603387) from 11 unrelated families, Riviere et al. (2012) identified a
heterozygous 1117G-A transition in the PIK3R2 gene, resulting in a
gly373-to-arg (G373R) substitution in the PIK3R2 gene. This mutation was
shown to be de novo in all subjects for whom parental DNA was available.
The mutation occurred at a CpG dinucleotide, which might explain its
recurrence.
