DELTA-9-DESATURASE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD; EC 1.14.99.5) is an iron-containing enzyme
that catalyzes a rate-limiting step in the synthesis of unsaturated
fatty acids. The principal product of SCD is oleic acid, which is formed
by desaturation of stearic acid. The ratio of stearic acid to oleic acid
has been implicated in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation
through effects on cell membrane fluidity and signal transduction. Four
SCD isoforms, Scd1 through Scd4, have been identified in mouse. In
contrast, only 2 SCD isoforms, SCD1 and SCD5 (608370), have been
identified in human. SCD1 shares about 85% amino acid identity with all
4 mouse SCD isoforms, as well as with rat Scd1 and Scd2. In contrast,
SCD5 shares limited homology with the rodent SCDs and appears to be
unique to primates (Zhang et al. (1999); Wang et al., 2005).

CLONING

Thiede et al. (1986) isolated cDNAs encoding rat Scd. By RT-PCR of
adipose tissue RNA with primers based on the sequence of rat Scd, Li et
al. (1994) isolated a partial human SCD cDNA. Using RNase protection
assays, the authors found that human SCD was expressed at higher levels
in colon and esophageal carcinomas than in the counterpart normal
tissues.

Zhang et al. (1999) cloned additional cDNAs corresponding to the
full-length human SCD transcript, which differed at 15 positions from
that of Li et al. (1994), leading to 6 predicted amino acid changes.
Zhang et al. (1999) reported that the deduced 359-amino acid SCD protein
contains the 3 highly conserved histidine-containing regions that are
essential for the enzyme's catalytic activity. The coding region of
human SCD shares 85% and 82% nucleotide identity with those of mouse
Scd1 and Scd2, respectively. Northern blot analysis revealed that SCD is
expressed ubiquitously as 3.9- and 5.2-kb mRNAs, with the highest levels
in brain and liver. The 2 transcripts arise from use of alternative
polyadenylation signals.

GENE FUNCTION

By stable expression of SCD antisense cDNA in transformed human lung
fibroblasts, Scaglia and Igal (2005) found that SCD depletion led to
decreased synthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids and phospholipids and
promoted accumulation of saturated fatty acid-enriched unesterified
fatty acids and triacylglycerol. Concomitantly, SCD deficiency led to
reduced cell proliferation, loss of anchorage-independent growth, and
increased sensitivity to ceramide-independent apoptosis. Cells
expressing low SCD levels were more sensitive to the cytotoxic effects
of exogenous palmitic acids. Because the effects of SCD deficiency were
not reversed by the addition of exogenous oleic acid, Scaglia and Igal
(2005) concluded that endogenous synthesis of monounsaturated fatty
acids is essential in maintaining cellular lipid homeostasis.

Using a mouse model of BCR (151410)/ABL (189980)-induced chronic myeloid
leukemia, Zhang et al. (2012) found that expression of Scd1 was
downregulated in leukemia stem cells. Knockdown of Scd1 in
BCR/ABL-expressing mouse leukemia stem cells downregulated expression of
apoptosis-related genes. Scd1 expression was induced by a PPAR-gamma
(PPARG; 601487) agonist, resulting in reduced proliferation of leukemia
stem cells. Scd1 appeared to have no effect on proliferation or
apoptosis of normal hematopoietic stem cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Zhang et al. (1999) demonstrated that the human SCD gene spans
approximately 24 kb and contains 6 exons. They noted that the human,
mouse, and rat SCD genes show similar organizations.

MAPPING

By analysis of a somatic cell hybrid panel, Zhang et al. (1999) mapped
the SCD gene to chromosome 10 and a transcriptionally inactive,
processed SCD pseudogene to chromosome 17.

Wang et al. (2005) stated that the mouse Scd1, Scd2, Scd3, and Scd4
genes map within a 200-kb stretch on chromosome 19 and are likely
derived from tandem duplication events. Since no other SCD genes map to
human chromosome 10, Wang et al. (2005) suggested that a gene
duplication event similar to that resulting in the mouse Scd genes did
not occur in humans.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Suhre et al. (2011) reported a comprehensive analysis of
genotype-dependent metabolic phenotypes using a GWAS with nontargeted
metabolomics. They identified 37 genetic loci associated with blood
metabolite concentrations, of which 25 showed effect sizes that were
unusually high for GWAS and accounted for 10 to 60% differences in
metabolite levels per allele copy. These associations provided new
functional insights for many disease-related associations that had been
reported in previous studies, including those for cardiovascular and
kidney disorders, type 2 diabetes, cancer, gout, venous thromboembolism,
and Crohn disease. Suhre et al. (2011) identified dbSNP rs603424 in the
SCD gene as associated with myristate/myristoleate ratio with a p value
of 2.9 x 10(-57).

ANIMAL MODEL

Zheng et al. (1999) identified deletions in the Scd1 gene in the asebia
(ab) mutant mouse, which has rudimentary sebaceous glands and develops
alopecia.

Miyazaki et al. (2000) found that asebia (Scd1 -/-) mice had decreased
levels of liver cholesterol esters and triglycerides, despite high
activities of Acat (see ACAT1; 607809) and Gpat (GPAM; 602395), the
enzymes that catalyze synthesis of cholesterol esters and triglycerides,
respectively. Additionally, ad libitum access of Scd1 -/- mice to diets
rich in oleate and palmitoleate did not restore their hepatic
cholesterol esters and triglycerides to the levels found in normal mice.
Miyazaki et al. (2000) concluded that Scd1 has an important role in
cholesterol and lipoprotein homeostasis.

To examine the mechanism underlying the metabolic actions of leptin
(164160), Cohen et al. (2002) used transcription profiling to identify
leptin-regulated genes in ob/ob liver. Leptin was found to specifically
repress RNA levels and enzymatic activity of SCD, which catalyzes the
biosynthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids. Mice lacking Scd1 were lean
and hypermetabolic; ob/ob mice with mutations in Scd1 were significantly
less obese than ob/ob controls and had markedly increased energy
expenditure. Ob/ob mice with mutations in Scd1 had histologically normal
livers with significantly reduced triglyceride storage and VLDL
production. Cohen et al. (2002) concluded that downregulation of Scd1 is
an important component of leptin's metabolic actions.

SCD is a central lipogenic enzyme catalyzing the synthesis of
monounsaturated fatty acids, mainly oleate (C18:1) and palmitoleate
(C16:1), which are components of membrane phospholipids, triglycerides,
wax esters, and cholesterol esters. Several SCD isoforms (Scd1, -2, and
-3) exist in the mouse. Ntambi et al. (2002) showed that mice with a
targeted disruption of the Scd1 isoform had reduced body adiposity,
increased insulin (176730) sensitivity, and resistance to diet-induced
weight gain. The protection from obesity involved increased energy
expenditure and increased oxygen consumption. Compared with wildtype
mice, the Scd1 -/- mice had increased levels of plasma ketone bodies but
reduced levels of plasma insulin and leptin. In these homozygous null
mice, the expression of several genes of lipid oxidation was
upregulated, whereas lipid synthesis genes were downregulated. These
observations suggested that a consequence of Scd1 deficiency is an
activation of lipid oxidation in addition to reduced triglyceride
synthesis and storage.

Miyazaki et al. (2003) found that liver X receptor-alpha (NR1H3; 602423)
agonists and a high carbohydrate fat-free diet induced Scd4 expression
in mice, but unlike Scd1, Scd4 expression was not repressed by dietary
polyunsaturated fatty acids. Scd4 mRNA expression was elevated 5-fold in
the hearts of leptin (164160)-deficient ob/ob mice relative to wildtype
controls. Treatment of ob/ob mice with leptin decreased Scd4 mRNA
levels, but did not affect Scd1 or Scd2 mRNA levels. Scd4 mRNA levels
were induced 3-fold in the hearts of Scd1-deficient mice.

Miyazaki et al. (2005) found that Scd2 expression was high in mouse
livers between embryonic day 18.5 and 21 days of age and decreased in
adult mice. In contrast, Scd1 expression was induced after weaning.
Miyazaki et al. (2005) found that Scd2 knockout was embryonic lethal in
some mice depending upon the genetic background. In a strain able to
tolerate Scd2 deletion, newborn Scd2-null mice were smaller than
wildtype littermates, and a few hours after birth their skin appeared
dry and cracked due to a permeability barrier defect. Mutant skin also
showed repartitioning of linoleic acid from epidermal acylceramide
species into phospholipids. Animals that survived to adulthood had
normal sebaceous glands and hair growth, but they had a twisted tail.

Using antisense Scd1 oligonucleotides, Gutierrez-Juarez et al. (2006)
lowered hepatic Scd1 expression and activity in rats and mice with
diet-induced insulin resistance. Insulin clamp studies revealed severe
hepatic insulin resistance in high fat-fed rats and mice that was
completely reversed by 5 days of treatment with antisense Scd1.
Downregulation of Scd1 in mice also decreased glucose production (by
about 75%), gluconeogenesis, and glycogenolysis. Downregulation of Scd1
led to increased Akt (AKT1; 164730) phosphorylation and decreased
expression of glucose-6-phosphatase (G6PC; 613742) and
phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK1; 261680). Gutierrez-Juarez et
al. (2006) concluded that Scd1 is required for the onset of diet-induced
hepatic insulin resistance.

Lam et al. (2007) found that intracerebroventricular administration of
glucose in rats lowered circulating triglycerides through inhibition of
VLDL secretion by the liver. The effect of glucose required its
conversion to lactate, leading to activation of ATP-sensitive potassium
channels and to decreased hepatic Scd1 activity. Injection of a
sequence-specific antisense oligodeoxynucleotide decreased the hepatic
activity of Scd1 and recapitulated the effects of central glucose
administration on VLDL secretion, and portal infusion of oleic acid
negated the effects of both central glucose and Scd1 deficiency on VLDL
secretion. These central effects of glucose, but not those of lactate,
were rapidly lost in diet-induced obese rats. Lam et al. (2007)
suggested that a defect in brain glucose sensing might play a critical
role in the etiology of the metabolic syndrome.

609238	TITLE *609238 RAB GTPase-ACTIVATING PROTEIN 1-LIKE; RABGAP1L
;;TBC1 DOMAIN FAMILY, MEMBER 18; TBC1D18;;
KIAA0471
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Seki et al. (1997) cloned RABGAP1L, which they designated
KIAA0471. The transcript contains an Alu element in the 3-prime UTR. The
deduced protein contains 370 amino acids. SDS-PAGE detected RABGAP1L at
an apparent molecular mass of about 50 kD.

Using RT-PCR, Ishikawa et al. (1997) found ubiquitous RABGAP1L
expression. Highest expression was in placenta, liver, kidney, and small
intestine, and lowest expression was in skeletal muscle and spleen.

Hidaka et al. (2000) cloned mouse Rabgap1l, which they designated Hhl.
The deduced 298-amino acid protein contains a PTB domain and shares
homology with the N terminus of human GAPCENA (RABGAP1). Northern blot
analysis detected several Rabgap1l transcripts expressed in a
tissue-specific manner. In situ hybridization of day-14.5 embryos
revealed expression in heart and liver.

GENE FUNCTION

By differential display, Sharma et al. (2003) found that RABGAP1L
expression was upregulated in esophageal squamous cell carcinomas
compared with matched normal esophageal epithelial tissue. In
particular, RABGAP1L expression was upregulated in esophageal tumors
showing nodal invasion.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Ishikawa et al. (1997) mapped the RABGAP1L
gene to chromosome 1.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Most patients with Alzheimer disease (AD; 104300) are considered
sporadic late-onset cases with a complex etiology. By differential
display RT-PCR analysis, De Yebra et al. (2004) found inhibition of
RABGAP1L expression in medial septum and hippocampus in 3 of 6 AD
patients, including 1 with a PSEN1 (104311) mutation.

611477	TITLE *611477 RNA POLYMERASE II-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 3; RPAP3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Jeronimo et al. (2007) identified RPAP3 as an RNA polymerase II (see
180660)-associated protein in HEK293 human embryonic kidney cells and
obtained a full-length RPAP3 cDNA by database and sequence analyses. The
deduced 665-amino acid protein contains 2 helix-turn-helix
tetratricopeptide repeats characteristic of chaperone cofactors.

GENE FUNCTION

Using affinity purification, mass spectrometry, and bioinformatic
analysis, Jeronimo et al. (2007) mapped an interaction network of
protein complexes involved in the RNA polymerase II machinery. They
found that RPAP1 (611475), RPAP2 (611476), RPAP3, and XAB1 (611479) were
tightly bound to RNA polymerase II in the soluble nuclear compartment in
HEK293 cells, and gel filtration with epitope-tagged POLR2J (604150)
confirmed that RPAP1, RPAP3, and XAB1 cofractionated with RNA polymerase
II. Examination of the protein interaction network revealed that the
RPAPs and XAB1 also interacted with components of the Mediator (e.g.,
MED17; 603810) and Integrator (e.g., INTS3; 611347) complexes, as well
as with proteins able to assemble into molecular chaperone complexes,
including the prefoldins (e.g., PFDN6; 605660) and the AAA+ ATPases
RUVBL1 (603449) and RUVBL2 (604788).

MAPPING

Hartz (2007) mapped the RPAP3 gene to chromosome 12q13.11 based on an
alignment of the RPAP3 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK025561) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.2).

609977	TITLE *609977 CELL DIVISION CYCLE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 8; CDCA8
;;DASRA B;;
BOREALIN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CDCA8 is a component of a chromosomal passenger complex required for
stability of the bipolar mitotic spindle (Gassmann et al., 2004).

CLONING

By database analysis, Sampath et al. (2004) identified human CDCA8 as a
homolog of Xenopus Dasra B. The deduced 280-amino acid human protein,
which the authors called Dasra B, shares 42% and 23% identity with
Xenopus Dasra B and Dasra A, respectively. Immunofluorescence on
metaphase HeLa cells revealed Dasra B in a punctate distribution on
chromosomes, coincident with Aurora B (AURKB; 604970) staining.

Using a proteomic screen to identify proteins associated with
histone-depleted mitotic chromosomes, Gassmann et al. (2004) identified
CDCA8, which they called borealin. The deduced 280-amino acid protein
contains 2 putative nuclear localization signals. Secondary structure
predictions suggested borealin forms an N-terminal domain of 6 core
helices and a C-terminal domain of at least 2 strands and 3 helices.
Northern and Western blot analyses showed that borealin mRNA and protein
levels were significantly increased in mitosis. Immunolocalization of
borealin and Aurora B in HeLa cells revealed that the proteins
colocalized in a dynamic pattern throughout mitosis. Western blot
analysis detected borealin at an apparent molecular mass of 31 kD in
HeLa cell lysates.

GENE FUNCTION

By immunoprecipitation of HeLa cell lysates, Sampath et al. (2004) found
that Dasra B interacted with Aurora B and survivin (BIRC5; 603352).
Knockdown of Dasra B by small interfering RNA resulted in severe
chromosome misalignment at metaphase and accumulation of multiple
interphase nuclei. In Xenopus, Dasra B associated with survivin, Aurora
B, and Incenp (604411) in a chromosomal passenger complex required for
chromatin-induced microtubule stabilization and spindle formation.
Microtubule nucleation through the Dasra B-containing chromosomal
passenger complex was distinct from the Ran (601179)-GTP pathway of
chromatin-induced microtubule nucleation.

Using in vitro binding assays, Gassmann et al. (2004) showed that
recombinant human borealin interacted directly with in vitro translated
INCENP and survivin, but not with Aurora B or TD60 (RCC2; 609587).
Borealin also readily bound itself. Mutation analysis indicated that the
N-terminal domain of borealin, but not the C-terminal domain, interacted
with chromosomal passengers in vivo and could perturb their targeting to
centromeres but not to the spindle midzone. Knockdown of borealin in
HeLa cells by RNA interference resulted in delocalization of INCENP,
survivin, Aurora B, and TD60 and delayed mitotic progression.
Borealin-null cells showed kinetochore-spindle misattachments, increased
number of bipolar spindles associated with ectopic asters, and disrupted
chromosome partitioning at anaphase. Borealin did not increase the
kinase activity of Aurora B in the presence of INCENP and survivin, but
it was an Aurora B target protein.

Tsukahara et al. (2010) isolated a fission yeast cyclin B (123836)
mutant defective specifically in chromosome biorientation. Accordingly,
Tsukahara et al. (2010) identified Cdk1 (116940)-cyclin B-dependent
phosphorylation of survivin (603352). Preventing survivin
phosphorylation impaired centromere chromosomal passenger complex (CPC)
targeting as well as chromosome biorientation, whereas phosphomimetic
survivin suppressed the biorientation defect in the cyclin B mutant.
Survivin phosphorylation promoted direct binding with shugoshin (see
609168), which Tsukahara et al. (2010) defined as a conserved
centromeric adaptor of the CPC. In human cells, the phosphorylation of
borealin has a comparable role. Tsukahara et al. (2010) concluded that
this study resolved the conserved mechanisms of CPC targeting to
centromeres, highlighting a key role of Cdk1-cyclin B in chromosome
biorientation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Gassmann et al. (2004) determined that the CDCA8 gene contains 10 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Gassmann et al. (2004) mapped the CDCA8
gene to chromosome 1. They identified a possible pseudogene on
chromosome 7.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Ishikawa et al. (1997) cloned HSPA12A, which they designated
KIAA0417. The deduced protein contains 710 amino acids. RT-PCR analysis
detected highest HSPA12A expression in brain, followed by kidney,
testis, and ovary. Little to no expression was detected in other tissues
examined. In vitro translated HSPA12A had an apparent molecular mass of
73 kD by SDS-PAGE.

Han et al. (2003) cloned mouse Hspa12a. The deduced 675-amino acid
protein has an atypical HSP70 (see HSPA1A; 140550) ATPase domain, which
is in 2 parts separated by a 66-amino acid spacer region. Han et al.
(2003) identified human HSPA12A by database analysis. The 675-amino acid
human protein shares 96% identity with mouse Hspa12a and 60% identity
with human HSPA12B (610702). Northern blot analysis of human tissues
detected highest expression of a 6.5-kb transcript in brain, with
progressively lower levels in kidney, skeletal muscle, and heart. Mouse
Hspa12a showed a similar expression pattern, but it was not expressed in
skeletal muscle.

GENE FUNCTION

Han et al. (2003) found that Hspa12a was more highly expressed in
elicited peritoneal macrophages from an atherosclerosis-sensitive mouse
strain than in those from an atherosclerosis-resistant strain, and both
Hspa12a and Hspa12b were preferentially expressed in lesional portions
of aorta. In situ hybridization confirmed that Hspa12a and Hspa12b were
expressed in lesions, but not in normal nonlesional aortic tissue.

GENE STRUCTURE

Han et al. (2003) determined that the HSPA12A gene contains 12 exons and
has a long 3-prime UTR.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Ishikawa et al. (1997) mapped the HSPA12A
gene to chromosome 10. Han et al. (2003) mapped the mouse Hspa12a gene
to chromosome 19.
