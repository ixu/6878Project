603957	TITLE *603957 FLAVIN-CONTAINING MONOOXYGENASE 5; FMO5
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The flavin-containing monooxygenases (EC 1.14.13.8) catalyze the
oxidation of nucleophilic nitrogen, sulfur, and phosphorus atoms in a
wide variety of compounds, including many pesticides and drugs (Phillips
et al., 1995).

CLONING

By screening liver cDNA libraries with rabbit FMO5 as probe, Overby et
al. (1995) isolated cDNAs encoding guinea pig and human FMO5. The
predicted 533-amino acid human protein shares 85% and 87% sequence
identity with rabbit and guinea pig FMO5, respectively. Northern blot
analysis revealed that the human FMO5 gene is expressed as 2.6- and
3.8-kb mRNAs in liver. The FMO5 protein had an apparent molecular mass
of 60 kD on Western blots of adult and neonatal human liver.

Phillips et al. (1995) cloned human FMO5 by screening adult human
placenta and liver cDNA libraries with the rabbit coding sequence. The
deduced protein is between 51 and 56% identical to the 4 previously
identified human FMO proteins and shares the highest sequence identity
with FMO2 (603955).

GENE FUNCTION

Overby et al. (1995) found that the rabbit, guinea pig, and human FMO5
enzymes exhibited similar catalytic activities, which were distinct from
those of other FMOs. The authors concluded that FMO5 is not an efficient
drug-metabolizing enzyme and that it may have an alternative physiologic
role.

Miller et al. (1997) demonstrated that FMO5 transcripts are
progesterone-regulated in breast cancer cells specifically under the
control of the progesterone receptor B-isoform (PRB; 607311). Because
FMOs are involved in the metabolic activation of drugs and xenobiotic
compounds, including tamoxifen, the authors speculated that progesterone
may enhance the carcinogenicity of tamoxifen in target tissues that
overexpress PRB by upregulating FMO5.

MAPPING

By PCR analysis of somatic cell hybrids, McCombie et al. (1996) mapped
the FMO2 (603955) and FMO5 genes to chromosome 1q, where 3 other human
FMO genes are located. Using sequence analysis of a YAC contig, Gelb et
al. (1997) found that the FMO5 gene is located between the NPR1 (108960)
and CX40 (GJA5; 121013) genes. By FISH, they mapped this contig to
1q21.1. Gelb et al. (1997) noted that since the FMO1 gene maps to
1q23-q25, this excluded the possibility that a single gene cluster
contains the entire FMO family.
