;;PCDH-BETA-11
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Cadherins are calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion molecules, and
protocadherins constitute a subfamily of nonclassic cadherins. PCDHB11
is 1 of 16 tandemly arranged genes in the PCDHB gene cluster (604967) on
chromosome 5q31. Unlike the PCDHA (see 604966) and PCDHG (see 604968)
genes, which function as 'variable' exons that are spliced to downstream
constant region exons to produce mRNAs, the PCDHB genes do not use
constant region exons to produce mRNAs. Thus, each single-exon PCDHB
gene encodes the extracellular, transmembrane, and short cytoplasmic
domains of the protein (Wu et al., 2001). For further information on the
PCDHB genes, see 604967.

CLONING

Using PCR with degenerate primers to screen melanoma cell lines,
Matsuyoshi et al. (1997) obtained a cDNA fragment encoding part of
PCDHB11, which they termed ME2. RT-PCR analysis detected expression of
ME2 in melanoma, squamous carcinoma, and normal fibroblast cell lines,
but not in normal melanocytes, suggesting that ME2 may play a role in
the strong cell-cell adhesiveness of melanoma cells.

By PCR of a brain cDNA library, Wu and Maniatis (1999) cloned
full-length PCDHB11.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Wu et al. (2001) mapped the PCDHB11 gene
to chromosome 5q31. They localized the mouse PCDHB genes to chromosome
18c.
