DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Transport of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to the cell surface
membrane is critical for receptor-ligand recognition. However, mammalian
GPCR odorant receptors (ORs), when heterologously expressed in cells,
are poorly expressed on the cell surface. By screening for genes that
induced cell surface expression of ORs expressed in human embryonic
kidney cells, Saito et al. (2004) identified mouse and human REEP1
(609139). They searched databases for homologs of REEP1 and identified
several other REEP genes, including REEP6. In situ hybridization of
mouse olfactory epithelium revealed expression of Reep6 in supporting
cells, but not in olfactory neurons.

By subtractive hybridization to identify novel mouse genes expressed in
retina, Sato et al. (2005) cloned Dp1l1. The deduced 201-amino acid
protein shares 57% identity with mouse and human DP1 (DP1; 125265).
Northern blot analysis detected high expression of Dp1l1 in mouse retina
and liver, with lower levels in kidney and testis, and RT-PCR showed low
expression in spleen and lung. No expression was detected in brain. In
situ hybridization and immunohistochemical analyses showed that Dp1l1
mRNA and protein were localized richly in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs).
Dp1l1 was present in the cytoplasm in a punctate pattern. Sato et al.
(2005) concluded that Dp1l1 is a membrane protein that likely plays a
role in intracellular membrane trafficking in RGCs.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the REEP6
gene to chromosome 19 (TMAP RH92355).

By radiation hybrid analysis, Sato et al. (2005) mapped the mouse Dp1l1
gene to chromosome 10 in a region that shows homology of synteny to
human chromosome 19p13.3.

313440	TITLE *313440 SYNAPSIN I; SYN1
;;BRAIN PROTEIN 4.1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The SYN1 gene encodes synapsin I, a neuronal phosphoprotein associated
with the membranes of small synaptic vesicles. Synapsins may play a role
in synaptic neurotransmission, neuronal development, synaptogenesis,
maintenance of mature synapses, and plasticity (summary by Fassio et
al., 2011).

Also known as brain protein 4.1, synapsin I is the best characterized of
the nonerythroid forms of protein 4.1.

CLONING

Sudhof (1990) determined that differential splicing of the primary SYN1
transcript generates 2 separate forms of synapsin I.

Klagges et al. (1996) cloned the Drosophila synapsin gene (Syn), which
encodes 2 proteins, both of which contain a region with 50% amino acid
identity with the human protein. The Drosophila Syn gene contains 2 open
reading frames, separated by a single amber (UAG) stop codon. The
authors suggested that the large synapsin isoform in Drosophila may be
generated by UAG read-through, an unconventional mechanism for the
generation of protein diversity from a single gene.

GENE FUNCTION

Giovedi et al. (2004) found that interaction between mammalian synapsin
I and Rab3a (179490) regulated the activities of both proteins. Synapsin
I stimulated the Rab3a cycle by increasing GTP binding, GTPase activity,
and Rab3a recruitment to the synaptic vesicle membrane. Conversely,
Rab3a inhibited synapsin I binding to actin and synapsin I-induced
synaptic vesicle clustering.

The D-domain of Syn1 is a multifunctional domain that associates with
synaptic vesicles, regulates presynaptic targeting, binds SH3 domains of
interacting proteins, and contains phosphorylation sites that regulate
synaptic vesicle trafficking (summary by Fassio et al., 2011).

GENE STRUCTURE

Sudhof (1990) reported that synapsin I is encoded by a single-copy gene
containing 13 exons ranging in size from 58 bp to more than 1 kb. The
exons are nonuniformly distributed over more than 30 kb of DNA.

Derry and Barnard (1991) demonstrated that the gene for tissue inhibitor
of metalloproteinase (TIMP; 305370) is located within an intron of the
SYN1 gene in both mouse and man. The TIMP gene is transcribed in the
opposite direction to the SYN1 gene.

MAPPING

Yang-Feng et al. (1986) assigned the SYN1 gene to Xp11 by in situ
hybridization using a rat cDNA probe. Southern blot analysis of
human/Chinese hamster somatic cell hybrids carrying defined regions of
the human X chromosome confirmed the in situ mapping data. They also
determined the regional assignment in the mouse X chromosome. Yang-Feng
et al. (1986) hypothesized that the SYN1 gene may be mutant in human
X-linked disorders with primary neuronal degeneration, such as Rett
syndrome (312750). According to the evidence presented by Amar et al.
(1988), the mouse homolog, Syn1, is situated between Otc and Araf.

By detailed restriction mapping, Derry and Barnard (1992) demonstrated
that the 5-prime end of the SYN1 gene lies within 5 kb of the properdin
gene (PFC; 300383).

By in situ hybridization studies, Klagges et al. (1996) mapped the
Drosophila Syn gene to a single site in the region 86A on the right arm
of chromosome 3.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of a family with epilepsy and variable learning
disabilities and behavior disorders (300491), Garcia et al. (2004)
identified a trp356-to-ter mutation (313440.0001) in the SYN1 gene.

In 6 males from a large French Canadian family with X-linked partial
epilepsy and learning disabilities, Fassio et al. (2011) identified a
truncating mutation in the SYN1 gene (Q555X; 313440.0002). Two of the
mutation carriers had autism. Investigation of this gene in several
large cohorts of patients with epilepsy and/or autism identified 3
additional variants in the SYN1 gene (see, e.g., 313440.0003 and
313440.0004) in 1% of patients with autism spectrum disorders and 3.5%
of patients with epilepsy. Three of the 4 mutations affected the
D-domain, which is important for protein function. When expressed in
Syn1-null neurons, these 3 mutant proteins were unable to rescue
impairments in the size and trafficking of synaptic vesicle pools. The
findings demonstrated that SYN1 is a predisposing gene to epilepsy and
autism spectrum disorders and strengthened the hypothesis that a
disturbance of synaptic homeostasis underlies the pathogenesis of both
disorders.

ANIMAL MODEL

Synapsin I had been thought to regulate synaptogenesis and
neurotransmitter release from adult nerve terminals. To examine this
possibility, Chin et al. (1995) generated synapsin I-deficient mice by
homologous recombination. They found that outgrowth of predendritic
neurites and of axons was severely retarded in the hippocampal neurons
of embryonic synapsin I mutant mice. Furthermore, synapse formation was
significantly delayed in these mutant neurons. The results indicated to
the authors that synapsin I, indeed, plays a role in regulation of
axonogenesis and synaptogenesis. In these same mice, Li et al. (1995)
found that the organization of synaptic vesicles at presynaptic
terminals was markedly altered: densely packed vesicles were present
only in a narrow rim at active zones, whereas most vesicles were
dispersed throughout the terminal area. This was in contrast to the
organized vesicle clusters present in terminals of wildtype animals.
Release of glutamate from nerve endings, induced by potassium ion,
4-aminopyridine, or a Ca(2+) ionophore, was markedly decreased in
synapsin I mutant mice. Recovery of synaptic transmission after
depletion of neurotransmitter by high-frequency stimulation was greatly
delayed. Finally, synapsin I-deficient mice exhibited a strikingly
increased response to electrical stimulation, as measured by
electrographic and behavioral seizures. The results indicated to the
authors that synapsin I plays a key role in the regulation of nerve
terminal function in mature synapses, as well as a function in neuronal
development as found by Chin et al. (1995).

DISORDERS
SYN1, TRP356TER

In affected members of a family with epilepsy and variable learning
disabilities and behavior disorders (300491), Garcia et al. (2004)
identified a 1197G-A transition in exon 9 of the SYN1 gene, resulting in
a trp356-to-ter (W356X) mutation. The mutation was also present in
obligate carrier females.

EPILEPSY, X-LINKED, WITH VARIABLE LEARNING DISABILITIES AND BEHAVIOR
DISORDERS
SYN1, GLN555TER

In 6 male members of a large French Canadian family with X-linked
partial epilepsy with variable learning disabilities and behavioral
disorders (300491), including autism, Fassio et al. (2011) identified a
gln555-to-ter (Q555X) substitution in exon 12 of the SYN1 gene. The
mutation, which was found by linkage analysis followed by candidate gene
sequencing, was not found in 418 control chromosomes. In vitro
functional expression assays showed that the mutation virtually
abolished the DE-domain binding to synaptic vesicles. The mutation also
abolished or dramatically reduced phosphorylation of the protein and
abolished binding to the SH3 domains of interacting proteins. Expression
of the mutant protein in Syn1-null hippocampal cells caused impaired
axonal elongation and impaired synaptic trafficking by decreasing
release of synaptic vesicles, particularly from the readily releasable
pool. These findings were consistent with a complete loss of function.

Using lentivirus-infected mouse hippocampal neurons, Lignani et al.
(2013) found that the human Q555X mutation interfered with the ability
of SYN1 to interact with mouse Syn2 (600755) isoforms and altered the
subcellular distribution of SYN1 compared with wildtype SYN1. The Q555X
mutation impaired synchronous coupling of synaptic vesicles to vesicle
release machinery, reduced the probability of vesicle release in
excitatory synapses, and decreased the pool of readily releasable
vesicles in inhibitory synapses. The net effect was an
excitatory/inhibitory imbalance with network hyperexcitability.

DISORDERS
SYN1, ALA550THR

In 4 unrelated patients, 2 males and 2 females, with partial epilepsy
and/or autism spectrum disorders (300491), Fassio et al. (2011)
identified a hemizygous or heterozygous 1648G-A transition in exon 12 of
the SYN1 gene, resulting in an ala55-to-thr (A550T) substitution in the
D-domain of the protein. The mutation was not found in 709 control
chromosomes. All of the patients were of French-Canadian origin, and
haplotype analysis indicated a founder effect. In vitro functional
expression assays showed that the mutation impaired normal synaptic
vesicle trafficking in mouse hippocampal cells lacking the Syn1 gene.
There was impaired release of vesicles from the reserve and readily
releasable pools, consistent with a loss of function. The mutant protein
did not properly localize to the presynapse. The mutation did not affect
phosphorylation of the SYN1 protein or binding to SH3 domains of other
proteins.

DISORDERS
SYN1, THR567ALA

In 2 unrelated males with autism spectrum disorders (see 300491), Fassio
et al. (2011) identified a 1699A-C transversion in exon 12 of the SYN1
gene, resulting in a thr567-to-ala (T567A) substitution in the D-domain
of the protein. The mutation was not found in 709 control chromosomes.
In vitro functional expression assays showed that the mutation impaired
normal synaptic vesicle trafficking in mouse hippocampal cells lacking
the Syn1 gene. There was impaired release of vesicles from the reserve
and readily releasable pools, consistent with a loss of function. The
mutant T567A protein did not properly localize to the presynapse. One of
the patients also carried an ala51-to-glu (A51G) substitution in the
SYN1 gene on the same allele, which may have caused an effect on protein
function, but functional studies were not performed on the A51G variant.
The T567A mutation did not affect phosphorylation of the SYN1 protein or
binding to SH3 domains of other proteins.

164880	TITLE *164880 V-YES-1 YAMAGUCHI SARCOMA VIRAL ONCOGENE; YES1
;;ONCOGENE YES1;;
YAMAGUCHI SARCOMA ONCOGENE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The YES1 oncogene is homologous to the v-yes gene of the Yamaguchi
sarcoma virus. The v-yes gene product is associated with
tyrosine-specific protein kinase activity, and its amino acid sequence
shows a high degree of homology with that of the v-src gene product of
Rous sarcoma virus (see SRC; 190090) (summary by Semba et al., 1985).

CLONING

Using Northern blot analysis, Semba et al. (1985) found variable
expression of a 4.8-kb RNA related to v-yes in human embryonic
fibroblasts, 3 human cell lines, placenta, and fetal lung, liver, and
kidney.

Using a probe prepared from human YES2, a processed pseudogene, Sukegawa
et al. (1987) cloned human YES1 from an embryonic fibroblast cDNA
library. The deduced 543-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular
mass of 60.8 kD. It has a putative kinase domain, conserved ATP-binding
residues (lys305 and a GxGxxG motif at residue 284), a putative
autophosphorylation site (tyr416), and a putative myristoylation site
(gly2). Amino acids 91 through 543 of human YES1, including the kinase
domain, share 96% identity with the corresponding region of v-yes.

Oh et al. (2002) reported that the deduced 541-amino acid YES1 protein
contains an SRC homology-3 (SH3) domain, followed by an SH2 domain and a
C-terminal protein tyrosine kinase domain.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a yeast 2-hybrid assay of a HeLa cell library, Oh et al. (2002)
showed that YES1 interacted with QM (RPL10; 312173). Immunoprecipitation
analysis and protein pull-down assays showed that QM interacted with the
SH3 domain of YES1. Full-length QM suppressed the kinase activity of
YES1 by suppressing its autophosphorylation activity. Overexpression of
QM resulted in increased YES1 mRNA and protein expression.

GENE STRUCTURE

Sukegawa et al. (1987) found that the upstream region of the YES1 gene
is GC rich.

MAPPING

Semba et al. (1985) found in DNA from human embryo fibroblasts 10 EcoRI
fragments that hybridized with the Yamaguchi sarcoma virus oncogene. By
a study of human-mouse cell hybrids, 4 of these fragments, designated
YES1, were assigned to chromosome 18, and 1 fragment, designated YES2,
was assigned to chromosome 6. (YES2 was later found by Semba et al.
(1988) to be a pseudogene of YES1 and to be located at chromosome
22q11.2. Semba et al. (1988) stated: 'The failure of proper mapping in
our earlier experiment might have been caused by instability of hybrid
cell clones.') The other 5 fragments could not be mapped either because
hybridization signals were too weak or differentiation from mouse Yes
fragments was impossible. There was evidence for multiple copies of
YES-related genes in the human genome. At least 3 of the human YES gene
copies had both introns and exons, and 1 gene copy appeared to be a
pseudogene.

By isotopic in situ hybridization, Yoshida et al. (1985) mapped the YES1
gene to chromosome 18q21.3. They suggested that the localization is
consistent with a role in the pathogenesis of follicular lymphoma, which
is frequently associated with a t(14;18) translocation with the
breakpoint at 18q21 (Fukuhara et al., 1979); see 151430. Ohno et al.
(1987) found that although it is in the same chromosome region as BCL2
(151430), the YES gene is intact in cases of follicular lymphoma. Using
yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs) containing the YES1 gene as probes
and fluorescence in situ hybridization, Silverman et al. (1993) detected
a strong signal in the region corresponding to chromosome 18p11.3. These
YACs were found to contain another 18p11.32 gene, thymidylate synthase
(188350); the genes were less than 50 kb apart.

Overhauser et al. (1993) identified a sequence-tagged site in the YES1
gene and used it in studies of somatic cell hybrids with deletion of
various segments of chromosome 18 to map the gene to 18pter-p11.21.

605063	TITLE *605063 STRESS-INDUCED PHOSPHOPROTEIN 1; STIP1
;;STI1, YEAST, HOMOLOG OF;;
HSP70/HSP90-ORGANIZING PROTEIN; HOP
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

STIP1 is an adaptor protein that coordinates the functions of HSP70 (see
HSPA1A; 140550) and HSP90 (see HSP90AA1; 140571) in protein folding. It
is thought to assist in the transfer of proteins from HSP70 to HSP90 by
binding both HSP90 and substrate-bound HSP70. STIP1 also stimulates the
ATPase activity of HSP70 and inhibits the ATPase activity of HSP90,
suggesting that it regulates both the conformations and ATPase cycles of
these chaperones (Song and Masison, 2005).

CLONING

By microsequencing a protein that was upregulated in transformed
embryonic lung fibroblasts and using degenerate PCR primers to screen a
transformed embryonic lung fibroblast cDNA library, Honore et al. (1992)
obtained a cDNA encoding STIP1. The predicted 543-amino acid hydrophilic
protein contains a tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR), a 34-amino acid motif
that is repeated at least 6 times in STIP1. STIP1 is homologous to the
yeast stress-inducible mediator of the heat shock response, Sti1.
Western blot analysis and 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis showed that
STIP1 was expressed as an approximately 61-kD protein. Northern blot
analysis showed that STIP1, which was expressed as an approximately
2.1-kb transcript, was upregulated in transformed cell lines and
psoriatic keratinocytes. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that STIP1
localized to the Golgi in normal fibroblasts, but mainly to the nucleus
in transformed cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Using mutation analysis, Chen and Smith (1998) localized a putative
HSP90-binding domain to a central tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) of the
HOP sequence, and a putative HSP70-binding domain to an N-terminal TPR.
Using in vitro steroid receptor assembly reactions, they found that
reactions performed with HOP carrying mutations in the putative HSP70-
and HSP90-binding domains resulted in receptor complexes that failed to
incorporate HSP90. Chen and Smith (1998) concluded that HOP acts as an
adaptor that directs HSP90 to preexisting HSP70-progesterone receptor
complexes.

By mutating the TPR regions of yeast Sti1, Song and Masison (2005)
identified separate domains involved in the regulation of Hsp70 and
Hsp90. All Sti1 mutations impaired protein folding, which required both
Hsp70 and Hsp90. Human HOP1 complemented a yeast strain lacking Sti1,
suggesting conservation of HSP70 and HSP90 regulation.

Arruda-Carvalho et al. (2007) stated that STI1 is an extracellular
protein that modulates cell death and differentiation through
interaction with prion protein (PRNP; 176640). They treated rat retinal
explants with mouse Sti1 or with neutralizing antibody and identified
both Prnp-dependent and -independent roles for Sti1 in ganglion and
neuroblastic cell death and differentiation.

Canalization, or developmental robustness, is an organism's ability to
produce the same phenotype despite genotypic variations and
environmental influences. Expression of a gain-of-function allele of
Drosophila Kruppel results in misregulation of genes in the fly eye disc
and generation of eye outgrowths, which are normally repressed via
canalization. Using a fly eye outgrowth assay, Gangaraju et al. (2011)
showed that a protein complex made up of Piwi (see 605571), Hsp83
(HSP90), and Hop was involved in canalization. The results suggested
that canalization may involve Hsp83-mediated phosphorylation of Piwi.
Gangaraju et al. (2011) concluded that the eye outgrowth phenotype is a
defect in epigenetic silencing of a normally suppressed genotype.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Scheufler et al. (2000) reported the crystal structures of the
N-terminal TPR domain (TPR1) of HOP in the presence of a bound peptide
consisting of the C-terminal 12 amino acids of HSC70 and of a C-terminal
domain (TPR2A) of HOP in complex with a peptide representing the 5
C-terminal residues of HSP90. The structures provided insight into how
TPR domain cochaperones specifically recognize HSP70 and HSP90 proteins
and explained the conservation of the EEVD motif in all HSP70 and HSP90
family members known to interact with TPR proteins.

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the STIP1
gene to 11q13 (TMAP stSG137).

606479	TITLE *606479 NEUROLIGIN 2; NLGN2
;;NL2;;
KIAA1366
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Neuroligins, such as NLGN2, are trans-synaptic adhesion molecules
thought to function in synapse formation, specification, or both. They
are ligands of neurexins (see NRXN1; 600565), which are synaptic cell
adhesion molecules involved in synapse specification (summary by
Chubykin et al., 2007).

CLONING

By screening brain cDNA libraries for sequences with the potential to
encode large proteins, Nagase et al. (2000) identified a partial cDNA
encoding NLGN2, which they called KIAA1366. The deduced 550-amino acid
protein, which is 98% identical to the 836-residue rat protein, was
predicted to be involved in cell signaling and communication. RT-PCR
analysis detected wide expression of NLGN2 that was particularly high in
brain, lung, and ovary, followed by kidney and testis. Expression was
high in all brain regions.

By PCR with degenerate primers corresponding to the sequence for rat
Nlgn1 (600568), Ichtchenko et al. (1996) isolated cDNAs encoding rat
Nlgn2 and Nlgn3 (300336). Northern blot analysis revealed that
expression of all 3 Nlgns was restricted to rat brain.

GENE FUNCTION

Using rodent hippocampal neurons and cortical slices, Chubykin et al.
(2007) showed that Nl2 reinforced activity-dependent inhibitory, but not
excitatory, synaptic responses. In contrast, Nl1 reinforced
activity-dependent excitatory, but not inhibitory, synaptic responses.
Nl1 and Nl2 were not required for synapse formation.

Using predominantly human and rodent constructs, Graf et al. (2004)
found that NRXN1-beta expressed in nonneuronal cells clustered the
postsynaptic proteins gephyrin (GPHN; 603930) and PSD95 (DLG4; 602887),
neurotransmitter receptors, and all 4 neuroligins in cocultured rodent
hippocampal neurons. The isolated LNS domain of NRXN1-beta was
sufficient for this synaptogenic activity when expressed in cells or
immobilized on beads. Neuroligin aggregation alone was synaptogenic, but
it showed some specificity: neuroligins-1, -3, and -4 (NLGN4; 300427)
linked only to glutamatergic postsynaptic proteins, but neuroligin-2
linked to both glutamatergic and GABAergic postsynaptic proteins.
Overexpression of neuroligin-2 in cultured neurons dispersed both
GABAergic and glutamatergic dendritic postsynaptic protein clusters and
reduced frequency of both AMPA-mediated miniature excitatory
postsynaptic currents and GABA-mediated miniature inhibitory
postsynaptic currents.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the NLGN2
gene to chromosome 17 (TMAP stSG4773).

606433	TITLE *606433 UDP-GLYCOSYLTRANSFERASE 1 FAMILY, POLYPEPTIDE A8; UGT1A8
;;UGT1H
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Enzymes of the UDP glycosyltransferase (UGT; EC 2.4.1.17) superfamily
covalently link glycosyl groups to lipophilic substrates. UGT1A enzymes,
such as UGT1A8, efficiently use UDP-glucuronic acid as the glycosyl
donor and are invaluable in detoxifying both endogenous and foreign
chemicals, because the glycosylated chemical is more water soluble and
therefore more readily excreted. Several UGT1A enzymes, including
UGT1A8, are encoded by the UGT1A gene complex on chromosome 2q37. Within
this complex, 9 viable first exons are independently spliced to 4 common
exons to generate 9 UGT1A transcripts with unique 5-prime ends and
identical 3-prime ends. UGT1A8, like each first exon within the UGT1A
gene complex, is considered a unique gene linked to the 4 common exons
(Gong et al., 2001; Mackenzie et al., 2005). See 191740 for further
information on the UGT1A gene complex.

CLONING

By screening colon cDNA libraries with UGT-specific primers, Mojarrabi
and Mackenzie (1998) detected and sequenced UGT1A1 (191740), UGT1A3
(606428), UGT1A4 (606429), UGT1A6 (606431), UGT1A8, UGT1A9 (606434), and
UGT1A10 (606435). Of these forms, only UGT1A8 and UGT1A10 are expressed
predominantly in colon; the others are found in liver and other
extrahepatic tissues. Sequence analysis predicted that the catalytically
active form of UGT1A8 has lys132, thr202, and met212, instead of arg,
ala, and leu, respectively, at these positions. Western blot analysis
showed expression of a 56-kD protein that is most active towards
hydroxylated metabolites of carcinogenic coumarins. RT-PCR analysis
revealed expression in colon but not in liver, kidney, and several other
tissues. Mojarrabi and Mackenzie (1998) suggested that UGT1A8 may be of
particular importance in the glucuronidation of drugs given orally or as
suppositories as well as in the elimination of ingested dietary mutagens
and toxins.

Strassburg et al. (1998) independently cloned and characterized UGT1A8.
The deduced 530-amino acid UGT1A8 protein is approximately 94% identical
to UGT1A7 (606432) and UGT1A9 in the N terminus. By direct RT-PCR
analysis, they detected UGT1A8 expression in colon.

Using Northern blot analysis, Basu et al. (2004) detected
tissue-specific expression of UGT1A1, UGT1A7, UGT1A8, UGT1A9, and
UGT1A10. UGT1A8 showed high expression in stomach only, with barely
detectable expression in small and large intestines. In situ
hybridization showed UGT1A8 expression throughout the gastrointestinal
tract, with highest expression in mucous-secreting cells of the stomach
fundus.

GENE FUNCTION

Basu et al. (2004) showed that UGT1A1, UGT1A7, UGT1A8, UGT1A9, and
UGT1A10 metabolized a broad range of chemicals, predominantly
flavonoids, anthraquinones, hydrocarbons, and simple phenols. They also
exhibited different pH optima according to the particular substrate and
differed in their responses to high substrate concentrations. UGT1A8 had
a pH optimum of 7.0.

MAPPING

By Southern blot analysis, Ritter et al. (1992) determined that all of
the UGT1A genes map to the same locus on chromosome 2.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

No 2 tissues contain the same identical complement of UGT proteins. This
observation suggests that the functional properties of the proteins may
have evolved to meet the unique challenges necessary for glucuronidation
in different tissues. This is best represented by the extrahepatic
expression of UGT1A7, UGT1A8, and UGT1A10, all 3 of which are found in
different tissues of the intestinal tract. With the high concentration
of UGTs in the intestinal tract, these proteins may play an important
role in first-pass metabolism, and thus alterations in function
resulting from pharmacogenetic differences may influence systemic drug
levels and therapeutic outcome. Huang et al. (2002) identified 4
genotypes at the UGT1A8 locus in 69 individuals. Their results indicated
that the functional properties of the proteins encoded by UGT1A8*1 and
UGT1A8*2 differ significantly in catalytic potential from UGT1A8*3.

606847	TITLE *606847 TCOF1 GENE; TCOF1
;;TREACLE
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By positional cloning, the Treacher Collins Syndrome Collaborative Group
(1996) identified a novel gene of unknown function, which they
designated treacle, within the Treacher Collins syndrome (TCS; 154500)
critical region at 5q. Northern blot analysis indicated that the gene is
expressed in a variety of fetal and adult tissues. Dixon et al. (1997)
isolated the coding sequence of the gene, designated TCOF1, and
determined that it encodes a low complexity, serine/alanine-rich protein
of approximately 144 kD. The deduced 1,411-amino acid protein has 3
domains with unique N and C termini and a large central repeat domain.
Wise et al. (1997) showed that the repeat protein motifs are shared with
nucleolar trafficking proteins in other species and are predicted to be
highly phosphorylated by casein kinase II (115440). Consistent with
this, the full-length TCOF1 protein sequence also contains putative
nuclear and nucleolar localization signals.

So et al. (2004) identified 1 major and 2 minor in-frame splice variants
of treacle that differed from the transcript reported by the Treacher
Collins Syndrome Collaborative Group (1996). The major variant includes
an additional 231-nucleotide exon, 6A, which introduces an additional
repeat of alternating basic and acidic regions and a novel functional
monopartite nuclear localization signal (KRAKK). The deduced protein
contains 1,488 amino acids and has a calculated molecular mass of 152
kD. Northern blot analysis of HeLa cells detected this variant at about
5.5 kb. RT-PCR detected 1.5- to 3.7-fold higher expression of variants
containing exon 6A than those lacking this exon in all human tissues and
cell lines examined. The 2 minor variants identified by So et al. (2004)
include one containing a different additional exon (16A) and the other
lacking exon 19.

Dixon et al. (1997) isolated the murine homolog of the TCOF1 gene and
showed that it encodes a protein of 133 kD. Interspecies comparison
indicated that the proteins display 61.5% identity, with the level of
conservation being greatest in the regions of acidic/basic amino acid
repeats and nuclear localization signals. These features are shared with
the nucleolar phosphoproteins. Confirmation that the gene isolated was
orthologous with the Treacher Collins syndrome gene was provided by the
demonstration that it mapped to central mouse chromosome 18 in a region
of conserved synteny with 5q21-q33. The gene was found to be expressed
in a wide variety of embryonic and adult tissues of the mouse. So et al.
(2004) examined mouse Tcof1 transcripts and identified a variant
containing an additional exon (16A).

GENE STRUCTURE

Gladwin et al. (1996) defined the intron-exon structure of the TCOF1
gene, identified 7 exons, and derived intronic sequences. Wise et al.
(1997) reported the complete exon/intron genomic structure of the TCOF1
gene and its complete coding sequence. The TCOF1 gene contains 26 exons.

So et al. (2004) identified 2 additional exons within the TCOF1 gene:
exon 6A and exon 16A. The sequence containing exon 6A transcribes the
major TCOF1 isoform.

MAPPING

The Treacher Collins Syndrome Collaborative Group (1996) found that the
treacle gene (TCOF1), which is mutant in Treacher Collins syndrome, is
located on chromosome 5q in a gene-rich region of the human genome.
DTDST (606718), CSF1R, PDGFRB (173410), and CDX1 (600746) are within
approximately 900 kb proximal of the TCOF1 locus, determined by a
combination of radiation hybrid and YAC/cosmid contig analysis. The same
process demonstrated that DHLAG, RPS14, HSST (600853), GPX3 (138321),
and ANX6 are distal to TCOF1. Moreover, a large number of additional
genes of unknown function had been mapped to the region.

GENE FUNCTION

The Treacher Collins Syndrome Collaborative Group (1996) stated that the
clinical phenotype of Treacher Collins syndrome suggests that the
responsible gene plays a fundamental role in early embryonic
development, particularly in development of the craniofacial complex.
Dixon et al. (1997) observed that peak levels of expression in the
developing mouse embryo were present at the edges of the neural folds
immediately before fusion, and also in the developing branchial arches
at the time of critical morphogenetic events. Dixon et al. (1997)
commented that these observations support a role for the gene in the
development of the craniofacial complex and provide further evidence
that the gene encodes a protein that may be involved in
nucleolar-cytoplasmic transport.

Jones et al. (1999) used treacle fusion peptides to demonstrate that the
region encoded by exon 9 is phosphorylated in vitro by both casein
kinase II and protein kinase C (see 176960). Furthermore, they found
such a kinase activity to be present in protein extracts from several
embryonic avian tissues, including branchial arches I and II.

Using database mining and protein structural prediction programs, Emes
and Ponting (2001) identified a sequence motif in the products of genes
mutated in Miller-Dieker lissencephaly (LIS1; 601545), Treacher Collins,
oral-facial-digital type 1 (CXORF5; 300170), and ocular albinism with
late-onset sensorineural deafness (TBL1X; 300196) syndromes. Over 100
eukaryotic intracellular proteins were found to possess a LIS1 homology
motif, including several katanin p60 (606696) subunits, muskelin
(605623), Nopp140 (602394), the plant proteins tonneau and LEUNIG, slime
mold protein aimless, and numerous WD repeat-containing beta-propeller
proteins. The authors suggested that LIS1 homology motifs may contribute
to the regulation of microtubule dynamics, either by mediating
dimerization, or else by binding cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain (600112)
or microtubules directly. The predicted secondary structure of LIS1
homology motifs, and their occurrence in homologs of G-beta
beta-propeller subunits, suggests that they are analogs of G-gamma
subunits, and might associate with the periphery of beta-propeller
domains. The finding of LIS1 homology motifs in both treacle and Nopp140
reinforces previous observations of functional similarities between
these nucleolar proteins.

Valdez et al. (2004) showed that treacle is involved in ribosomal DNA
gene transcription by interacting with upstream binding factor (UBF;
600673). Immunofluorescence labeling showed that treacle and UBF
colocalize to specific nucleolar organizer regions and cosegregate
within nucleolar caps of actinomycin D-treated HeLa cells; biochemical
analysis showed the association of treacle and UBF with chromatin.
Immunoprecipitation and the yeast 2-hybrid system both suggested
physical interaction of the 2 nucleolar phosphoproteins. Downregulation
of treacle expression using specific short interfering RNA (siRNA)
resulted in inhibition of ribosomal DNA transcription and cell growth. A
similar correlation was observed in Tcof1 +/- mouse embryos that
exhibited craniofacial defects and growth retardation. Valdez et al.
(2004) concluded that treacle haploinsufficiency in patients with
Treacher Collins syndrome may result in abnormal development caused by
inadequate ribosomal RNA production in the prefusion neural folds during
the early stages of embryogenesis.

Gonzales et al. (2005) showed that antisense-mediated downregulation of
Tcof1 expression in Xenopus oocytes reduced 2-prime-O-methylation of
pre-rRNA. Analysis of RNA isolated from wildtype and Tcof1 +/- mice
embryos from strains that exhibit a lethal phenotype showed significant
reduction in 2-prime-O-methylation at nucleotide 463C of 18S rRNA. There
was no significant difference in rRNA methylation between wildtype and
heterozygous embryos of DBAxBALB/c mice, which have no obvious
craniofacial phenotype. The authors proposed that the function of TCOF1
in pre-rRNA methylation is most likely mediated by its direct physical
interaction with NOP56 (614154), a component of the ribonucleoprotein
methylation complex. Although TCOF1 colocalizes with UBF throughout
mitosis, it colocalizes with NOP56 and fibrillarin (FBL; 134795), a
putative methyltransferase, only during telophase when rDNA gene
transcription and pre-rRNA methylation are known to commence. The
authors suggested that TCOF1 might link RNA polymerase I-catalyzed
transcription and posttranscriptional modification of pre-rRNA. Gonzales
et al. (2005) hypothesized that haploinsufficiency of TCOF1 in TCS
patients may result in inhibition of production of properly modified
mature rRNA in addition to inhibition of rDNA gene transcription, which
consequently affects proliferation and proper differentiation of
specific embryonic cells during development.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

The Treacher Collins Syndrome Collaborative Group (1996) identified
different mutations in the TCOF1 gene in each of 5 unrelated families
with Treacher Collins syndrome. All of the mutations were predicted to
result in premature termination of the gene product.

Gladwin et al. (1996) used oligonucleotide primers designed from the
intronic sequence to amplify each exon from genomic DNA. They amplified
exons from the DNA of one affected individual from each of 33 Treacher
Collins families and screened for mutations using SSCP. They identified
mobility shifts in 4 exons. The mutations identified by Gladwin et al.
(1996) included 3 deletions (of either 1 or 2 nucleotides), an insertion
of a single nucleotide, and an unusual splicing mutation. They reported
that these 5 mutations are all different from the 5 mutations previously
reported by the Treacher Collins Syndrome Collaborative Group (1996) and
that all 10 of the mutations found in TCOF1 are nonsense or frameshift
mutations that would be predicted to result in premature termination of
the protein product. None of the TCOF1 mutations found in affected
individuals were detected on chromosomes from 200 controls. Gladwin et
al. (1996) noted that all reported mutations were unique to each family.

Dixon (1996) reviewed the clinical and molecular features of Treacher
Collins syndrome. A total of 20 mutations in the TCOF1 gene had been
identified, of which 2 were nonsense mutations, 5 were insertions, 11
were deletions, and 2 were splicing mutations. A 5-bp deletion had been
observed in 4 unrelated families. All of the mutations observed resulted
in introduction of premature termination codons into the reading frame,
suggesting haploinsufficiency as the molecular mechanism underlying the
disorder.

Edwards et al. (1997) reported several previously undescribed mutations
throughout the TCOF1 gene in patients with Treacher Collins syndrome,
bringing the total number of reported mutations to 35, which represented
a detection rate of 60%. All but one of the mutations resulted in the
introduction of a premature termination codon into the predicted
protein. Moreover, the mutations were largely family specific, although
a common 5-bp deletion in exon 24 was seen in 7 different families and a
recurrent splicing mutation in intron 3 in 2 different families. The
mutational spectrum supported the hypothesis that TCS results from
haploinsufficiency. Throughout the open reading frame, Wise et al.
(1997) detected 8 mutations in TCS families and several polymorphisms
(e.g., 154500.0003).

Splendore et al. (2000) screened 28 families with a clinical diagnosis
of Treacher Collins syndrome for mutations in the 25 coding exons of the
TCOF1 gene and their adjacent splice junctions, using SSCP and direct
sequencing. Pathogenic mutations were detected in 26 patients (93%),
bringing the number of known disease-causing mutations from 35 to 51. A
clustering of pathogenic mutations was identified. They confirmed a
previous finding that TCOF1 has an unusually high rate of
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within its coding region.

Splendore et al. (2002) found no mutations in the TCOF1 gene in 3
disorders with features overlapping those of Treacher Collins syndrome:
Goldenhar syndrome (164210), Nager syndrome (154400), and Miller
syndrome (263750).

In 33 of 60 patients (55%) with Treacher Collins syndrome, Splendore et
al. (2002) identified 31 mutations in the TCOF1 gene, 27 of which were
novel. Five exons accounted for over 50% of the mutations, with exons 23
and 24 being the main hotspots. All mutations except 1, a tyr50-to-cys
substitution (Y50C; 606847.0005), resulted in a truncated protein.

In a patient with the clinical diagnosis of Treacher Collins syndrome,
Shoo et al. (2004) identified a heterozygous 2-bp deletion in the TCOF1
gene (606847.0006). The mother was clinically unaffected but the same
mutation was found in her leukocytes, hair root bulbs, buccal mucosa,
urine, and stool. Maternal grandparents did not have the mutation.
Because the mother had the mutation in cells derived from all 3 germ
layers, Shoo et al. (2004) at first suspected that the mutation was
nonpenetrant; however, they could not detect the mutation in her skin
fibroblasts, suggesting that she was mosaic.

Shows et al. (2006) reported on an infant rhesus macaque (Macaca
mulatta) that displayed the Treacher Collins syndrome phenotype and was
identified at the California National Primate Research Center. They
cloned the TCOF1 coding region from a normal rhesus macaque and
sequenced it. The rhesus homolog of TCOF1 was found to be 91.6%
identical in cDNA sequence and 93.8% identical in translated protein
sequence to human TCOF1. Sequencing of TCOF1 in the TCS-affected rhesus
macaque showed no mutations within the coding region or splice sites;
however, real-time quantitative PCR showed an 87% reduction of spleen
TCOF1 mRNA in the affected macaque when compared with normal macaque
spleen. The presumed haploinsufficiency of functional protein,
especially at the critical timepoint in development when TCOF1 is
normally expressed in large quantities to promote development of the
craniofacial skeleton, may account for the phenotype; the lower level of
mRNA was not caused by nonsense-mediated mRNA decay because a nonsense
mutation was not found in the coding region. A promoter mutation could
not be excluded.

Bowman et al. (2012) identified pathogenic sequence variants in the
TCOF1 gene in 92 (50.5%) of 182 unrelated patients with a clinical
diagnosis consistent with Treacher Collins syndrome. Of those with a
sequence change, 57% had a frameshift or mutation disrupting the start
codon, 23% had a nonsense mutation, 16% had a splice site mutation, and
4% had a missense mutation. In addition, 5.2% of patients had an
intragenic deletion of the TCOF1 gene. Thus, the majority of TCOF1
mutations lead to a loss of protein function and haploinsufficiency.

ANIMAL MODEL

Haworth et al. (2001) isolated the dog homolog of the TCOF1 gene from a
dog embryonic head/neck cDNA library. The protein shows a similar
3-domain structure to that described for human TCOF1, but the dog gene
lacks exon 10 and contains 2 exons not present in the human sequence. In
addition, exon 19 is differentially spliced in the dog. They mapped the
dog TCOF1 gene to chromosome 4q31, a region showing syntenic homology
with human chromosome 5. Genetic analysis of DNA of dogs from 13
different breeds identified 9 DNA sequence variants, 3 of which gave
rise to amino acid substitutions. Grouping dogs according to head type
showed that a 396C-T variant, leading to a pro117-to-ser amino acid
substitution, is associated with skull/face shape in this dog panel. The
numbers were small, but the association between the T allele and
brachycephaly, broad skull/short face, was highly significant (P =
0.000024). The short period of time during which the domestic dog breeds
have been established suggests that this mutation has arisen only once
in the history of dog domestication.

Dixon et al. (2006) created Tcof1 +/- mouse lines and noted that the
extent and severity of the phenotype was dependent upon the genetic
background. Tcof1 +/- neonates obtained through an intercross of DBA
Tcof1 heterozygotes and wildtype C57BL/6 mice exhibited a phenotype that
mimicked TCS. The heads of Tcof1 +/- neonates were small and dome
shaped, with anteroposterior shortening and severe frontonasal
dysplasia. Tcof1 +/- neonates displayed gasping behavior and abdominal
distention and died within 24 hour of birth. Skeletal analysis indicated
that Tcof1 +/- neonates died from respiratory arrest due to
malformations of the nasal, premaxilla, maxilla, and palatine skeletal
elements. Whole-embryo culture of wildtype and Tcof1 +/- mouse embryos
showed that Tcof1 haploinsufficiency resulted in neural crest cell
hypoplasia due to neuroepithelial-specific apoptosis. Furthermore, Dixon
et al. (2006) found that Tcof1 haploinsufficiency resulted in deficient
production of mature ribosomes, leading to apoptosis and reduced cell
proliferation.

Richter et al. (2010) used Tcof1 mutant mice to dissect the
developmental mechanisms underlying congenital hearing loss. Effective
cavitation of the middle ear was intimately linked to growth of the
auditory bulla, the neural crest cell-derived structure that
encapsulates all middle ear components, and defects in these processes
had a profoundly detrimental effect on hearing.

NOMENCLATURE

The designation 'treacle' may be best used for the protein encoded by
the TCOF1 locus. The word treacle clearly comes from Treacher Collins
and may have been devised by the British members of the collaborative
group where 'treacle' is the equivalent of the American's 'molasses.'

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
TREACHER COLLINS SYNDROME
TCOF1, GLN252TER

In affected members of a family with Treacher Collins syndrome (154500),
the Treacher Collins Syndrome Collaborative Group (1996) found a C-to-T
transition at nucleotide 703 that created a stop codon in place of a
glutamine residue, resulting in premature termination of the protein.
The mutation created a BfaI site allowing the confirmation that this
mutation was present in all of the affected but none of the unaffected
family members.

Edwards et al. (1997) stated that this gln-to-ter mutation occurred at
position 252 (Q252X).

.0002
TREACHER COLLINS SYNDROME
TCOF1, 1-BP INS, 422A

Wise et al. (1997) described a patient with familial Treacher Collins
syndrome (154500) who had an insertion of a single adenine after
nucleotide 422 in exon 5 (422insA). The insertion caused a change from
histidine to glutamine at codon 141 and a change in the subsequent amino
acids, with a stop codon 33 amino acids beyond the site of the
insertion.

.0003
TREACHER COLLINS SYNDROME
TCOF1, 4-BP DEL, NT497

In a patient with Treacher Collins syndrome (154500), Wise et al. (1997)
demonstrated a mutation in the TCOF1 gene that consisted of deletion of
4 bp, ATAC, after nucleotide 497 (497delATAC). The deletion caused a
change in codon 166 from asparagine to isoleucine and a change in the
downstream amino acids until the point of a stop codon 44 amino acids
beyond the deletion.

.0004
TREACHER COLLINS SYNDROME
TCOF1, 5-BP DEL, NT4135

In a review of mutations in the TCOF1 gene causing Treacher Collins
syndrome (154500), Splendore et al. (2000) found that the most frequent
recurring mutation was a 5-bp deletion in exon 24 (4135-4139delGAAAA).
This mutation was reported in 7 families by Edwards et al. (1997), was
found by Splendore et al. (2000) in 6 unrelated patients, and was said
to be responsible for approximately 16% of all reported cases.

.0005
TREACHER COLLINS SYNDROME
TCOF1, TYR50CYS

In a patient with sporadic Treacher Collins syndrome (154500), Splendore
et al. (2002) identified a 149A-G transition in exon 2 of the TCOF1
gene, resulting in a tyr50-to-cys (Y50C) substitution. Analysis of
parental DNA indicated that the mutation arose de novo. The mutation was
not detected in 100 control chromosomes. Splendore et al. (2002) noted
that missense mutations causing Treacher Collins syndrome are rare (most
are truncating mutations), and pointed out that human exons 1 and 2 are
highly conserved, suggesting that the N terminus of the protein is an
important functional domain.

.0006
TREACHER COLLINS SYNDROME
TCOF1, 2-BP DEL, 1408AG

In a patient with the clinical diagnosis of Treacher Collins syndrome
(154500), Shoo et al. (2004) identified a heterozygous 2-bp deletion,
1408delAG, in the TCOF1 gene. The mother was clinically unaffected but
the same mutation was found in her leukocytes, hair root bulbs, buccal
mucosa, urine, and stool. Maternal grandparents did not have the
mutation. Because the mother had the mutation in cells derived from all
3 germ layers, Shoo et al. (2004) at first suspected that the mutation
was nonpenetrant; however, they could not detect the mutation in her
skin fibroblasts, suggesting that she was mosaic.

.0007
TREACHER COLLINS SYNDROME
TCOF1, ARG911TER

In a 5-year-old girl with Treacher Collins syndrome (154500) and
craniosynostosis, choanal atresia, and esophageal regurgitation,
Horiuchi et al. (2004) identified a de novo 2731C-T transition in exon
17 of the TCOF1 gene, resulting in an arg911-to-ter (R911X) change that
truncates the protein.

.0008
TREACHER COLLINS SYNDROME
TCOF1, 18-BP DEL, NT376

In a patient with typical Treacher Collins syndrome (154500), Marszalek
et al. (2003) identified a heterozygous 18-bp deletion beginning at
nucleotide 376 within the 5-prime splice site in exon 4 of the TCOF1
gene. The deletion included 3 bp of exon 4 and 15 bp of intron 4 and
resulted in premature termination of the protein. Real-time PCR analysis
showed different melting temperatures of the amplified fragments
containing the normal allele and the mutated allele, which could be used
as a rapid screening assay. Marszalek et al. (2003) stated that the
deletion was the third largest found to date in the TCOF1 gene.

.0009
TREACHER COLLINS SYNDROME
TCOF1, 1-BP DEL, 4134A

In a patient with Treacher Collins syndrome (154500), Splendore et al.
(2002) identified a 1-bp deletion (4134delA) in exon 24 of the TCOF1
gene.

In a patient with Treacher Collins syndrome who had novel craniofacial
and extracraniofacial features, Li et al. (2009) identified the same
frameshift mutation (4365delA) in the TCOF1 sequence that includes an
additional 231-nucleotide exon (6A). The mutation resulted in a
read-through of the native stop codon of the TCOF1 gene, adding more
than 80 novel amino acids to the 3-prime end of the protein. The authors
noted that the patient also had a 1535T-C transition in TCOF1, resulting
in a met512-to-thr substitution; this substitution was also present in
his unaffected mother. Unusual features in the patient included
encephalocele, marked malformation of the eyes, abnormal inner ear
structures, and several anomalies that involved the thyroid, the thymus,
the heart, an accessory spleen, ectopic adrenal gland tissue, and
underdeveloped external genitalia.

606195	TITLE *606195 IROQUOIS HOMEOBOX PROTEIN 5; IRX5
;;IRXB2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

IRX5 is a member of the Iroquois homeobox gene family. Members of this
family appear to play multiple roles during pattern formation of
vertebrate embryos.

CLONING

Members of the Iroquois complex in Drosophila, including the highly
homologous homeobox genes caupolican, araucan, and mirror, act as
prepattern molecules in neurogenesis. Bosse et al. (1997) identified 3
members of the Iroquois homeobox gene family in mouse and showed that
they are involved in several embryonic developmental processes including
anterior/posterior and dorsal/ventral patterning of specific regions of
the central nervous system, and regionalization of the otic vesicle,
branchial epithelium, and limbs.

By EST database searching, Lewis et al. (1999) identified a human
breast-derived partial cDNA clone containing a novel homeobox. Using
oligonucleotide primers designed to this clone for RACE/PCR, they
obtained the full-length cDNA, which they designated IRX2 but which was
later designated IRX5, as well as fragments of transcripts derived from
4 additional IRX genes. The human IRX homeodomains are about 90%
identical to the homeodomains of the Drosophila Iroquois complex
proteins and about 93% identical to each other. Each of the IRX proteins
contains a hexapeptide-like motif. Lewis et al. (1999) found that the
deduced 417-amino acid IRX5 protein also contains acidic and polyproline
regions and an IRO box. Northern blot analysis detected 2 main
transcripts of 2.6 and 3.9 kb, but the larger transcript did not appear
to contain a closely related homeobox. IRX5 expression is not
breast-specific, as it was found to be weakly expressed in adult human
lung, uterus, salivary gland, and kidney. In situ hybridization
demonstrated that IRX5 is differentially expressed in major mammary
epithelial cell lineages and that its expression is further regulated
during both the proliferative and cyclical phases of human breast
development. IRX5 expression is maintained in human mammary neoplasias.

GENE FUNCTION

Through in vivo modeling in Xenopus laevis embryos, Bonnard et al.
(2012) demonstrated that Irx5 modulates the migration of progenitor cell
populations in branchial arches and gonads by repressing Sdf1 (CXCL12;
600835). They also found that transcriptional control by Irx5 is
modulated by direct protein-protein interaction with GATA3 (131320) and
TRPS1 (604386). Bonnard et al. (2012) suggested that IRX proteins
integrate combinatorial transcriptional inputs to regulate key signaling
molecules involved in the ontogeny of multiple organs during
embryogenesis and homeostasis.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 5 affected individuals from 2 consanguineous families with an
autosomal recessive craniofacial syndrome mapping to chromosome
16q12.2-q21 (611174), Bonnard et al. (2012) screened 73 candidate genes
and identified 2 homozygous missense mutations in the IRX5 gene
(606195.0001 and 606195.0002) that segregated with disease in each
family. Irx5 knockdown by morpholino injection in X. laevis embryos
recapitulated the blood, heart, germ cell, and craniofacial anomalies
seen in patients with IRX5 mutations. In addition, Bonnard et al. (2012)
found that IRX5 has direct protein-protein interactions with GATA3 and
TRPS1, and noted that disruption of the latter proteins causes syndromes
with overlapping features (see hypoparathyroidism, sensorineural
deafness, and renal disease, 131320, and trichorhinophalangeal syndrome,
190350, respectively).

MAPPING

By screening of a human genomic library with chicken IRX2 cDNA and EST
database searching, Ogura et al. (2001) cloned 4 human IRX genes. By
fluorescence in situ hybridization, they mapped the IRX5 and IRX7
(606196) genes to chromosome 16q11.2-q13 and the IRX1 (606197) and IRX2
(606198) genes to chromosome 5p15.3.

ANIMAL MODEL

Costantini et al. (2005) found that homozygous Ire5-knockout mice were
viable and fertile but had a defect in the differentiation of retinal
cone bipolar cells and were slightly smaller than wildtype.
Electrocardiograms revealed a significantly decreased signal amplitude
during ventricular repolarization. Lack of the cardiac repolarization
gradient was due to increased Kv4.2 (KCND2; 605410) in endocardial
myocardium, resulting in a selective increase of the transient outward
current, which is the major cardiac repolarization current, and in an
increased susceptibility to arrhythmias. Myocardial Irx5 was expressed
in a gradient opposite that of Kcnd2, and Irx5 repressed Kcnd2
expression by recruiting Bop (SMYD1; 606846), a cardiac transcriptional
repressor. Costantini et al. (2005) concluded that an IRX5 repressor
gradient negatively regulates potassium channel gene expression in the
heart and ensures coordinated cardiac repolarization.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HAMAMY SYNDROME
IRX5, ASN166LYS

In 3 sibs from a consanguineous Jordanian family, originally described
by Hamamy et al. (2007), with severe hypertelorism, midface prominence,
myopia, mental retardation, and bone fragility (611174), Bonnard et al.
(2012) identified homozygosity for a 498C-A transversion in the IRX5
gene, resulting in an asn166-to-lys (N166K) substitution at a
phylogenetically invariant residue in the third helix of the
homeodomain. Functional analysis demonstrated altered protein stability
and DNA binding activity, suggesting that the N166K mutation may act as
a hypomorphic rather than null allele.

.0002
HAMAMY SYNDROME
IRX5, ALA150PRO

In 2 brothers from a consanguineous Turkish family with severe
hypertelorism, midface prominence, myopia, mental retardation, and bone
fragility (611174), Bonnard et al. (2012) identified homozygosity for a
448G-C transition in the IRX5 gene, resulting in an ala150-to-pro
(A150P) substitution at a phylogenetically invariant residue in the
second helix of the homeodomain. The mutation segregated with disease in
the family. X. laevis embryos with Irx5 knockdown showed defective
cranial neural crest cell migration that could be rescued with wildtype
mouse Irx5 DNA but not A150P Irx5 DNA. The A150P variant was also
unstable in X. laevis embryos compared to wildtype or N166K
(606195.0001); Bonnard et al. (2012) suggested that the A150P mutation
may act as a hypomorphic rather than null allele.

610243	TITLE *610243 ZINC FINGER FYVE DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 27; ZFYVE27
;;PROTRUDIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Mannan et al. (2006) identified ZFYVE27 as a potential spastin
(604277)-interacting protein in a yeast 2-hybrid assay. They described 4
splice variants of ZFYVE27. Transient transfection of HeLa cells with
epitope-tagged ZFYVE27 constructs revealed that ZFYVE27 is predominantly
expressed in punctate vesicles, although a tubular pattern of expression
was observed in a small proportion of cells. Colocalization studies
detected overlapping expression with the endosomal marker EEA1 (605070)
and the endoplasmic reticulum marker RTN1 (600865).
Coimmunoprecipitation studies in NIH3T3 cells determined that spastin
mediates interaction with ZFYVE27 through its N-terminal domain, which
consists of an MIT (microtubule-interacting and trafficking) motif. An
immunoprecipitation assay confirmed the interaction of endogenous
spastin with ZFYVE27.

GENE STRUCTURE

Mannan et al. (2006) determined that the ZFYVE27 gene consists of 13
exons.

MAPPING

Mannan et al. (2006) noted that the ZFYVE27 gene maps to chromosome
10q24.2.

GENE FUNCTION

Shirane and Nakayama (2006) identified protrudin as a mammalian protein
that promoted neurite formation through interaction with the guanosine
diphosphate (GDP)-bound form of Rab11 (see 605570). Phosphorylation of
protrudin by extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK; 600997) in
response to nerve growth factor (NGFB; 162030) promoted protrudin
association with Rab11-GDP. Downregulation of protrudin by RNA
interference induced membrane extension in all directions and inhibited
neurite formation. Thus, Shirane and Nakayama (2006) concluded that
protrudin regulates Rab11-dependent membrane recycling to promote the
directional membrane trafficking required for neurite formation.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a 5-generation German family with hereditary spastic paraplegia
(SPG33; 610244), Mannan et al. (2006) detected a missense mutation in
the ZFYVE27 gene (610243.0001) that segregated with the clinical
phenotype in affected individuals. Mannan et al. (2006) postulated that
this mutation affects neuronal intracellular trafficking in the cortical
spinal tract, which is consistent with the pathology of hereditary
spastic paraplegia. Mannan et al. (2006) excluded the ZFYVE27 gene from
both the SPG9 (601162) and the SPG27 (609041) loci.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA 33, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
ZFYVE27, GLY191VAL

In affected members of a 5-generation German family with hereditary
spastic paraplegia (SPG33; 610244), Mannan et al. (2006) found a G-to-T
transversion at position 572 in exon 6 of the ZFYVE27 cDNA. The mutation
produced a gly191-to-val (G191V) substitution. The G191V mutation (G105V
in isoform c of the protein) is located near the third transmembrane
motif and shifts the transmembrane motif forward by 3 amino acids.
Mannan et al. (2006) observed that expression of the mutated protein
showed an aberrant intracellular pattern in tubular structures and that
its interaction with spastin was severely affected.

Martignoni et al. (2008) commented that they found no difference in the
ability of wildtype or G191V-mutant protrudin to extend neurites in
cellular functional expression studies. The G191V-mutant protein was
also found to interact with Rab11-GDP (605570) and spastin (604277),
indicating that the mutation did not lead to loss of function.
Martignoni et al. (2008) stated that G191V (dbSNP rs35077384) had been
identified as a SNP in several populations, with an allele frequency
ranging from 0.008 to 0.067, thus casting doubt on the pathogenicity of
this mutation. Mannan (2008) replied that their studies showed a
decreased interaction between G191V-mutant protrudin and spastin and
explained that discrepancies could be due to the different assays used
or the variable effect of G191V-mutant protrudin in different ethnic
populations.

;;GLUTAMYLCYCLOTRANSFERASE, GAMMA; GCTG;;
CHROMOSOME 7 OPEN READING FRAME 24; C7ORF24;;
CYTOCHROME c-RELEASING FACTOR, 21-KD; CRF21
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

GGCT (EC 2.3.2.4) catalyzes the formation of 5-oxoproline (pyroglutamic
acid) from gamma-glutamyl dipeptides and may play a significant role in
glutathione homeostasis (Oakley et al., 2008).

CLONING

By mass spectrometric analysis of peptides obtained from an
apoptosis-inducing protein, followed by database analysis and RT-PCR of
total RNA from a human leukemia cell line, Masuda et al. (2006) cloned
GGCT, which they called CRF21. SDS-PAGE detected purified CRF21 at an
apparent molecular mass of 21 kD.

Using tryptic peptides obtained from GGCT partially purified from
expired human red blood cells for database analysis, Oakley et al.
(2008) obtained a full-length GGCT cDNA. The deduced 188-amino acid
protein has a calculated molecular mass of 21 kD. EST database analysis
revealed moderate GGCT expression in a wide range of human tissues, with
highest levels in bladder and salivary gland. Database analysis
identified GGCT orthologs in a range of species from C. elegans to
mammals, but not in plants.

GENE FUNCTION

Geranylgeraniol (GGO) induces apoptosis in human tumor cell lines
through a mitochondria-dependent pathway that includes cytochrome c
release. Masuda et al. (2006) found that GGO was unable to induce
cytochrome c release from isolated human mitochondria directly, and they
identified CRF21 as a cytosolic cytochrome c-releasing factor involved
in GGO-induced apoptosis. Overexpression of CRF21 in HeLa cells induced
cytochrome c release and apoptosis. Masuda et al. (2006) noted that
GGO-induced apoptosis was inhibited by a dominant-negative mutation of
JNK (MAPK8; 601158) that impeded JNK signaling, suggesting involvement
of JNK and CRF21 in GGO-induced apoptosis.

Oakley et al. (2008) confirmed that recombinant human GGCT used
gamma-glutamyl-L-alanine as its substrate. The enzymatic kinetics were
similar to those of GGCT purified from human erythrocytes.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Oakley et al. (2008) determined the crystal structure of recombinant
human GGCT to 2.4-angstrom resolution. GGCT adopted a mixed alpha/beta
topology with 6 beta stands, 5 alpha helices, and 4 short 3(10) helices,
and it assumed a unique structural fold that the authors termed a GGCT
fold. GGCT formed dimers, and each monomer featured an invagination that
Oakley et al. (2008) proposed was the active site. The site was lined
with hydrophilic and amphipathic residues, including a conserved glu98
that appeared to function as a general acid/base in the reaction.
Mutation of glu98 to ala or gln did not alter the structural fold, but
it completely inactivated the enzyme. Mutation analysis showed that
gly23 and tyr105 also contributed to substrate binding interactions.

GENE STRUCTURE

Oakley et al. (2008) determined that the GGCT gene contains 5 exons and
spans 8 kb.

MAPPING

Bissbort et al. (1984) assigned the GGCT gene to chromosome 7pter-p14 by
somatic cell hybrid studies.

By genomic sequence analysis, Oakley et al. (2008) mapped the GGCT gene
to chromosome 7p15-p14. They identified putative GGCT pseudogenes on
chromosomes 5 and 20. Oakley et al. (2008) noted that the mouse Ggct
gene maps to a region of chromosome 6 that shares homology of synteny
with human chromosome 7p15-p14.

602428	TITLE *602428 HYALURONAN SYNTHASE 3; HAS3
DESCRIPTION For background information on hyaluronan (HA) and HA synthases, such as
HAS3, see HAS1 (601463).

CLONING

By degenerate PCR, Spicer et al. (1997) isolated a genomic fragment of
human HAS3 and genomic and cDNA clones of mouse Has3. The amino acid
sequences encoded by the partial human HAS3 fragment and the
corresponding region of mouse Has3 are 99% conserved. The authors noted
that the high degree of sequence conservation between specific human and
mouse HASs contrasts with the lower level of identity between HASs
within a species, suggesting an evolutionary conservation of
functionally important residues and differences in the mode of action of
the various HASs. The predicted 554-amino acid mouse Has3 protein has
several consensus HA-binding motifs and multiple transmembrane domains,
with 2 at the N terminus and a cluster at the C terminus. Northern blot
analysis of the mouse embryo showed that Has3 is predominantly expressed
at late gestation as a major, approximately 6.0- to 6.5-kb transcript
and a minor, approximately 4.0-kb transcript.

Monslow et al. (2003) identified a splice variant of human HAS3.

GENE FUNCTION

Spicer et al. (1997) found that expression of mouse Has3 in COS-1 cells
led to high levels of HA biosynthesis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Monslow et al. (2003) determined that the HAS3 gene has 4 exons and
spans about 12.5 kb. Exons 1 and 4 are subject to alternative splicing.
HAS3 has 2 promoter regions, and the 500-bp region upstream of each
transcription start site contains either 46 or 56 transcription
factor-binding sites. Upstream of exon 1 is a (GT)n repeat sequence.

MAPPING

By PCR screening somatic cell hybrid DNAs and a YAC contig, Spicer et
al. (1997) localized the human HAS3 gene to chromosome 16q22.1. By
interspecific backcross analysis, they mapped the mouse Has3 gene to
chromosome 8. Since HAS1 (601463), HAS2 (601636), and HAS3 are located
on different autosomes, Spicer et al. (1997) suggested that the HAS gene
family arose comparatively early in vertebrate evolution by sequential
duplication of an ancestral HAS gene.

168810	TITLE *168810 PROLINE-RICH PROTEIN, BstNI SUBFAMILY, 2; PRB2
;;PAROTID SALIVARY PROTEIN SIZE VARIANT; Ps;;
BASIC SALIVARY PROLINE-RICH PROTEIN, BstNI TYPE, 2
CON1, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION For background information on salivary proline-rich proteins, see PRB1
(180989).

The Ps proteins of saliva are so called because they are parotid size
variants, i.e., variants in the size of parotid salivary protein. The
polymorphism is determined by 1 unexpressed and 2 expressed alleles at
an autosomal locus. The electrophoretic polymorphism is manifested by
apparent differences in molecular weights between the Ps proteins which
are glycosylated. Ps and Pm are closely linked to Pr, Pa, Db, and G1
(Azen and Denniston, 1979). Goodman and Karn (1983) presented evidence
supporting the conclusion of Azen and Denniston (1980) that there is a
molecular weight difference between the 2 allelic proteins Ps-1 and
Ps-2. The difference appears to be due to an extension of the Ps-2 chain
(presumably at its COOH-end). Minaguchi et al. (1988) described new
variants.

O'Connell et al. (1987) suggested that there is a 3% recombination for
PRB loci and that the most likely orientation and order is as follows:
cen--(PRB2--PRB1--(PRB3,4))--12pter. Kim et al. (1990) determined that
the order of the 6 genes in a segment comprising 700 kb is PRB2, PRB1,
PRB4, PRH2, PRB3, and PRH1, 5-prime to 3-prime and cen-to-pter. They
presented a map of the region and a proposed scheme to account for the
evolution of the change. Although PRB2 and PRB1 loci showed
recombination of 1% in females and 3% in males, the physical distance
separating them was only 60 kb. Similarly, the recombination between
PRB1 and PRB3,4 was 1% in females and 2% in males, but the physical
distance separating these genes was 70 kb. Thus, there appears to be a
recombinational hotspot. Such was not found with PRB3 and PRB4, which
were separated by 350 kb but showed no recombination.

Azen et al. (1992) analyzed the fusion gene that is a product of unequal
and homologous crossing-over between PRB1 and PRB2. By comparison of the
restriction map of the fusion gene with the restriction maps of the PRB1
and PRB2 genes, Lyons et al. (1988) had shown that the 5-prime region of
the fusion gene was identical to the 5-prime region of PRB2 and included
the third exon of PRB2, whereas the region 3-prime to exon 3 of the
fusion gene was identical to that of PRB1. Therefore, this fusion gene
was named PRB2/1. The coding region of PRB1 is absent from the fusion
gene. Azen et al. (1992) demonstrated that Pe, PmF, PmS, and Ps were
missing from the saliva in 2 white homozygotes. The fusion gene was
relatively frequent in blacks, American Utah whites and mainland
Chinese, with gene frequencies of 0.22, 0.06, and 0.09, respectively.

601576	TITLE *601576 PROTEIN-TYROSINE PHOSPHATASE, RECEPTOR-TYPE, SIGMA; PTPRS
;;RPTP-SIGMA
DESCRIPTION 
GENE FAMILY

Protein-tyrosine phosphatase sigma (PTPRS) is a receptor type
protein-tyrosine phosphatase that has been cloned and identified in
mouse, in rat, and in human (Pulido et al., 1995). PTPRS is a member of
a subfamily of receptor type PTPases that includes LAR (PTPRF; 179590)
and PTP-delta. Wagner et al. (1996) noted that this subfamily of cell
surface glycoproteins is characterized by the presence of an
extracellular cell adhesion molecule-like motif and 2 intracellular
phosphatase domains. Transcripts of these genes are subject to RNA
processing, resulting in several distinct isoforms. These proteins share
a high overall degree of sequence similarity, especially in the second
intracellular catalytic domain, which is thought to interact with the
same molecule. Analysis of the expression pattern of PTPRS suggests that
it may be involved in the development of the nervous system.

GENE FUNCTION

Batt et al. (2002) examined the role of PTP on pituitary, pancreas, and
enteroendocrine cytodifferentiation, hormone production, and
development. The adenohypophyses of PTPRS-null mice were small and
exhibited reduced GH (see 139250) and PRL (176760) immunoreactivity.
Cells containing TSH (see 188540), LH (see 152780), FSH (see 136530),
ACTH, pituitary-specific POU homeodomain factor (Pit1; 173110), estrogen
receptor (see 133430), and steroidogenic factor-1 (184757) were found in
normal proportions and distributions. The diminished expression of GH
and PRL was not associated with apoptosis of somatotrophs or
lactotrophs. In the knockout mice, pancreatic islets were hypoplastic
with reduced insulin immunoreactivity, and there was also variable
expression of gut hormones. Functionally, the GH deficiency was
associated with hypoglycemia and death in the PTPRS-null neonates, and
accordingly, intraperitoneal administration of GH rescued the PTPRS-null
neonates and normalized the blood glucose. The authors concluded that
PTP-sigma plays a major role in differentiation and development of the
neuroendocrine system.

Shen et al. (2009) demonstrated that the transmembrane protein tyrosine
phosphatase PTP-sigma binds with high affinity to neural chondroitin
sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs; see 155760). Binding involves the
chondroitin sulfate chains and a specific site on the first
immunoglobulin-like domain of PTP-sigma. In culture, PTP-sigma-null
neurons show reduced inhibition by CSPG. A PTP-sigma fusion protein
probe can detect cognate ligands that are upregulated specifically at
neural lesion sites. After spinal cord injury, PTPRS gene disruption
enhanced the ability of axons to penetrate regions containing CSPG. Shen
et al. (2009) concluded that PTP-sigma can act as a receptor for
chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans and may provide new therapeutic
approaches to neural regeneration.

Coles et al. (2011) reported that RPTP-sigma, also known as PTPRS, acts
bimodally in sensory neuron extension, mediating CSPG inhibition and
HSPG (142460) growth promotion. Crystallographic analyses of a shared
HSPG-CSPG binding site reveal a conformational plasticity that can
accommodate diverse glycosaminoglycans with comparable affinities.
Heparan sulfate and analogs induced RPTP-sigma ectodomain
oligomerization in solution, which was inhibited by chondroitin sulfate.
RPTP-sigma and HSPGs colocalize in puncta on sensory neurons in culture,
whereas CSPGs occupy the extracellular matrix. Coles et al. (2011)
concluded that their results lead to a model where proteoglycans can
exert opposing effects on neuronal extension by competing to control the
oligomerization of a common receptor.

MAPPING

Wagner et al. (1996) used a murine cDNA of Ptprs as a hybridization
probe for genetic mapping of the human homolog, PTPRS. By fluorescence
in situ hybridization analysis, they showed that PTPRS maps to 19p13.3.
Hybridization analysis of chromosome 19 library cosmids revealed several
positive clones that are part of a contig located in the same region. In
addition, the location of this gene relative to previously mapped
proximal markers revealed a new point in the human-mouse synteny map by
extending the mouse chromosome 17 synteny region in the telomeric
direction.

ANIMAL MODEL

On the basis of its expression and homology with the Drosophila
melanogaster orthologs, which have roles in the targeting of axonal
growth cones, Elchebly et al. (1999) hypothesized that PTP-sigma may
also have a modulating function in cell-cell interactions, as well as in
axon guidance during mammalian embryogenesis. To investigate its
function in vivo, they generated Ptprs-deficient mice. The resulting
Ptprs -/- animals displayed retarded growth, increased neonatal
mortality, hyposmia, and hypofecundity. Anatomic and histologic analyses
showed a decrease in overall brain size with severe depletion of
luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (152760)-immunoreactive cells in
the hypothalamus of the Ptprs -/- mice. These mice also had an enlarged
intermediate pituitary lobe, but smaller anterior and posterior lobes.
These results suggested that tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent
signaling pathways regulated by PTP-sigma influence the proliferation
and/or adhesiveness of various cell types in the developing
hypothalamopituitary axis.

Wallace et al. (1999) likewise inactivated the Ptprs gene in mice by
gene targeting. They found that all Ptprs +/- mice developed normally,
whereas 60% of Ptprs -/- mice died within 48 hours after birth. The
surviving homozygous Ptprs -/- mice demonstrated stunted growth,
developmental delays, and severe neurologic defects including spastic
movements, tremor, ataxic gait, abnormal limb flexion, and defective
proprioception. Histopathology of brain sections showed reduction and
hypocellularity of the posterior pituitary of the homozygous deficient
mice, as well as a reduction of approximately 50 to 75% in the number of
choline acetyltransferase-positive cells in the forebrain. Moreover,
peripheral nerve electrophysiologic analysis revealed slower conduction
velocity in the homozygous deficient mice relative to wildtype or
heterozygous animals, associated with an increased proportion of slowly
conducting, small-diameter myelinated fibers and relative
hypomyelination. By approximately 3 weeks of age, most remaining
homozygous deficient mice died from a wasting syndrome with atrophic
intestinal villi. These results suggested that PTP-sigma has a role in
neuronal and epithelial development in mice.

Uetani et al. (2009) obtained late Ptprs/Ptprf double-knockout mouse
embryos at the expected mendelian ratio, but none survived to 4 weeks of
age, likely due to lethality of Ptprs knockout. At embryonic day 18.5,
double-knockout embryos showed severe craniofacial defects, including
exencephaly, micrognathia, and failure of eyelid closure. Additional
malformation of the eye included hyperplastic inner nuclear layers,
persistence of prominent hyaloid arteries, abnormal retrolental tissues,
and disorganized neural retina. Double-knockout embryos also showed
striking abnormalities of the urinary tract, such as hydroureters,
hydronephrosis, duplicated ureter/renal systems, and ureterocele.
Absence of Ptprs and Ptprf activity prevented normal execution of the
apoptotic program necessary for regression of the common nephric duct
during development, resulting in inappropriate tissue survival and
delayed distal ureter maturation. In cell culture, Ptprs bound and
negatively regulated the phosphorylation and signaling of the Ret
receptor tyrosine kinase (164761), whereas Ptprs-induced apoptosis was
inhibited by Ret expression. Uetani et al. (2009) concluded that ureter
positioning is controlled by the opposing actions of RET and LAR family

;;PTPN13-LIKE GENE, Y-LINKED, 2;;
PTPN13-LIKE GENE, Y-LINKED, CENTROMERIC
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Lahn and Page (1997) isolated PRY2 among testis cDNAs corresponding to
genes located in the nonrecombining portion of the Y chromosome. PRY2 is
1 of 3 PRY genes they identified in this region. Northern blot analysis
of several tissues detected PRY expression only in testis.

MAPPING

By analysis of a panel of partial Y chromosomes, Lahn and Page (1997)
mapped PRY genes to regions 6C (PRY2) and 6E (PRY1; 400019) on the long
arm of the Y chromosome, and to region 4A on Yp. Skaletsky et al. (2003)
determined that the region of chromosome Yq containing PRY1 and PRY2 is
palindromic.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Repping et al. (2004) identified the b2/b3 deletion within the AZFc
region (415000) of the Y chromosome, in which both PRY1 and PRY2 are
deleted. The b2/b3 deletion has no obvious effect on fitness.

604840	TITLE *604840 FK506-BINDING PROTEIN 8; FKBP8
;;FK506-BINDING PROTEIN, 38-KD; FKBP38
DESCRIPTION For background information on FK506-binding proteins (FKBPs), see FKBP1A
(186945).

CLONING

By PCR using Jurkat cell cDNA and degenerate oligonucleotides based on
conserved regions of FKBPs, Lam et al. (1995) identified a cDNA encoding
FKBP8. The deduced 355-amino acid protein shares 26 to 28% sequence
identity with other known human FKBPs. FKBP8 contains an N-terminal
domain that is 33% identical to that of FKBP12 (FKBP1A; 186945), a
putative leucine zipper domain, a 3-unit imperfect tetratricopeptide
repeat (TPR) domain, and a putative calmodulin-binding domain. Northern
blot analysis detected a single, approximately 1.35- to 2.4-kb FKBP8
transcript in all human tissues examined, with the highest expression in
brain.

Nielsen et al. (2004) presented evidence that the transcript encoding
the deduced 38-kD FKBP8 protein identified by Lam et al. (1995) is
truncated. By 5-prime RACE of adult mouse brain cDNA, they cloned
transcripts produced by utilizing alternate first exons that encode 402-
and 422-amino acid proteins with calculated molecular masses of 44 and
46 kD, respectively. The longer protein contains an N-terminal
N-myristoylation site. EST database analysis identified a human
transcript encoding a deduced 413-amino acid protein with an apparent
molecular mass of 45 kD

GENE FUNCTION

FKBPs are intracellular receptors for the immunosuppressive drug FK506.
The FKBP/FK506 complex exerts its immunosuppressive effects by
inhibiting calcineurin (e.g., PPP3CA; 114105), a calcium- and calmodulin
(e.g., CALM1; 114180)-dependent serine/threonine phosphatase that
functions as a critical signaling molecule during T-cell activation.
Using several human and mouse cell lines and expression constructs,
Shirane and Nakayama (2003) found that FKBP8, unlike FKBP12, bound to
and inhibited calcineurin even in the absence of FK506, suggesting that
FKBP8 is an inherent inhibitor of calcineurin. FKBP8 associated with
BCL2 (151430) and BCLXL (600039) in immunoprecipitation assays and
colocalized with these proteins in mitochondria. The expression of
mutant FKBP8 proteins induced redistribution of BCL2 and BCLXL.
Overexpression of FKBP8 blocked apoptosis, whereas functional inhibition
of FKBP8 by a dominant-negative mutant or by RNA interference promoted
apoptosis. Shirane and Nakayama (2003) suggested that FKBP8 may inhibit
apoptosis by anchoring BCL2 and BCLXL to mitochondrial membranes.

Presenilin-1 (PSEN1; 104311) and -2 (PSEN2; 600759) are mutated in some
forms of familial Alzheimer disease (FAD; see 607822 and 606889,
respectively). Wang et al. (2005) demonstrated that FKBP8 interacts with
PSEN1 and PSEN2 by forming macromolecular complexes together with BCL2.
Presenilins promoted degradation of FKBP8 and BCL2 and sequestered these
proteins in the ER/Golgi compartments, thereby inhibiting FKBP8-mediated
mitochondrial targeting of BCL2 via a gamma-secretase-independent
mechanism. Thus, presenilins increased susceptibility to apoptosis by
antagonizing the antiapoptotic function of FKBP8. In contrast,
C-terminal fragments of caspase-processed PSEN1 and PSEN2 redistributed
BCL2 to the mitochondria by abrogating the activity of full-length PSEN1
and PSEN2, resulting in a dominant-negative antiapoptotic effect. In
cultured cells and mutant PSEN1-knockin mouse brains, FAD-linked
presenilin mutants enhanced proapoptotic activity by causing a more
efficient reduction in mitochondrial BCL2 than wildtype presenilins.
Wang et al. (2005) suggested a novel molecular mechanism for the
regulation of mitochondria-mediated apoptosis by competition between
PSEN1/PSEN2 and FKBP8 for subcellular targeting of BCL2. Excessive
proapoptotic activity of PSEN1/PSEN2 may play a role in the pathogenesis
of FAD.

The mammalian target of rapamycin, mTOR (601231), is a central regulator
of cell growth. Its activity is regulated by RHEB (601293), a Ras-like
small GTPase, in response to growth factor stimulation and nutrient
availability. Bai et al. (2007) showed that RHEB regulates mTOR through
FKBP38, a member of the FK506-binding protein (FKBP) family that is
structurally related to FKBP12 (186945). FKBP38 binds to mTOR and
inhibits its activity in a manner similar to that of the
FKBP12-rapamycin complex. RHEB interacts directly with FKBP38 and
prevents its association with mTOR in a GTP-dependent manner. Bai et al.
(2007) concluded that their findings suggested that FKBP38 is an
endogenous inhibitor of mTOR, whose inhibitory activity is antagonized
by RHEB in response to growth factor stimulation and nutrient
availability.

GENE STRUCTURE

Nielsen et al. (2004) determined that the FKBP8 gene contains 10 exons
and spans about 12 kb. The mouse Fkbp8 gene, which spans more than 11
kb, has a structure identical to that of the human gene except that it
has 3 alternate first exons, designated 1a, 1b, and 1c. The first exon
of the human FKBP8 gene is homologous to mouse exon 1a. Sequences in the
exon 1a region are highly similar in mouse and human, and they are GC
rich with consensus CCAAT boxes and several binding sites for Sp1
(189906), AP2 (107580), MZF1 (194550), and IK2.

MAPPING

Nielsen et al. (2004) stated that the FKBP8 gene is located on
chromosome 19p12. They identified a polyadenylated pseudogene, which
shares 89% identity with FKBP8, located in the intronic region between
exons 10 and 11 of the PPP1R12B gene (603768) on chromosome 1q32.

ANIMAL MODEL

Unlike previous Fkbp8-null mouse mutants, the Fkbp8-null mice created by
Wong et al. (2008) showed posterior neural tube defects typical of spina
bifida but survived up to 5 months of age. At embryonic day 18.5, all
mutant fetuses presented with isolated spina bifida spanning the
thoracic and lumbar regions. Fkbp8-null mutants later developed splayed
hind limbs and lower body paralysis due to severe bone and cartilage
defects of the axial skeleton, including fused vertebrae. Loss of Fkbp8
resulted in increased apoptosis in the posterior neural tube. Microarray
analysis revealed abnormal expression and patterning of genes expressed
in the spinal cord. The phenotype of Fkbp8-null mutants appeared to be
due, in part, to diminished expression of Zic1 (600470) in the dorsal
neural tube and somites.

189903	TITLE *189903 NUCLEAR TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR Y, ALPHA; NFYA
;;TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR NF-Y, A SUBUNIT;;
NUCLEAR FACTOR BINDING TO Y BOX OF HLA GENES;;
HAP2 CCAAT-BINDING PROTEIN
DESCRIPTION NF-Y is a transcription factor thought to be essential for expression of
the class II genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC; see
142800). It recognizes a CCAAT motif upstream of gene promoters and is
probably involved in the regulation of a variety of genes, including
those for albumin (103600), alpha-globin (141800), collagen (see
120150), and beta-actin (102630). NF-Y is composed of 2 subunits, NFYA
and NFYB (189904), both of which are necessary for DNA binding. This
2-subunit DNA-binding unit has been well conserved during evolution.
NFYA and NFYB show striking sequence similarity with the yeast
transcription factors Hap2 and Hap3, both of which are required for
specific binding to a CCAAT-like motif. By in situ hybridization and
analysis of somatic cell hybrids, Li et al. (1991) assigned the NFYA
gene to 6p21 (close to MHC) and the NFYB gene to human chromosome 12.
After in situ hybridization, the maximum concentration of grains was in
the region 12q22-q23. By Southern blot analysis of recombinant inbred
lines and by in situ hybridization, the Nfya and Nfyb genes were
assigned to mouse chromosome 17 and mouse chromosome 10, respectively.

CCAAT, an upstream sequence element found in a multitude of higher
eukaryotic promoters, serves as the recognition sequence for a variety
of mammalian transcription factors. There are at least 3
chromatographically separable CCAAT-binding factors in HeLa cells: CP1,
CP2, and CTF/NF-1 (600729). These factors recognize overlapping but
distinct subsets of known CCAAT-containing promoters and make
distinguishable patterns of contacts with DNA in and around the CCAAT
motif. Becker et al. (1991) noted that of these 3 factors, CP1 bears the
greatest resemblance to the yeast Hap complex. This complex of 3 genes,
Hap2, Hap3, and Hap4, is required for the expression of respiration in
Saccharomyces cerevisiae--in particular, for expression of the principal
isoform of cytochrome C (CYC1; 123980). In the yeast, 3 proteins are
associated in a heteromeric complex that binds to an upstream activation
sequence in the CYC1 promoter. Like Hap2/3/4, CYP in the human consists
of a heteromeric association of at least 2 components, CP1A and CP1B,
both of which are required for binding. Most strikingly, the subunits of
CP1 and Hap2/3/4 can be interchanged in vitro. Thus, CP1 likely
represents the human homolog of the yeast Hap complex, with the CP1B
fraction containing the Hap2 homolog and the CP1A fraction containing a
Hap3 equivalent. Becker et al. (1991) reported the isolation of a HeLa
cDNA whose expression in S. cerevisiae corrected the respiratory defect
in a strain bearing a Hap2 deletion. The cDNA encoding the human Hap2
homolog encodes a protein of 257 amino acids which has a 62-amino acid
C-terminal region that shares 73% identity with the essential core
region of Hap2.

194543	TITLE *194543 ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 69; ZNF69
DESCRIPTION 
MAPPING

By hybridization to a panel of somatic cell hybrids containing various
deletions of chromosome 22, Aubry et al. (1992) mapped the genes
encoding 2 zinc finger proteins to the short arm of chromosome 22 and 4
others to the 22q11.2 region. Hitherto, the short arms of acrocentric
chromosomes were thought to encode only ribosomal RNA genes. The genes
assigned to 22p were ZNF72 (194546) and ZNF73 (194547); those assigned
to 22q11.2 were ZNF69, ZNF70 (194544), ZNF71 (194545), and ZNF74
(194548). It was later determined that the ZNF71 gene resides on
chromosome 19q13. In addition, Gross (2011) mapped the ZNF69 gene to
chromosome 19p13.2 based on an alignment of the ZNF69 sequence (GenBank
GENBANK BC051309) with the genomic sequence (GRCh37).

605184	TITLE *605184 POLYADENYLATE-BINDING PROTEIN-INTERACTING PROTEIN 1; PAIP1
;;POLY(A)-BINDING PROTEIN-INTERACTING PROTEIN 1;;
PABP-INTERACTING PROTEIN 1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

In initiation of translation in eukaryotes, binding of the small
ribosomal subunit to mRNA requires recognition of the 5-prime cap
structure by the cap-binding complex eIF4F. eIF4F consists of eIF4E
(133440), eIF4A (see 602641), and eIF4G (see 600495). Translation
initiation is further regulated by the mRNA 3-prime poly(A) tail and the
poly(A)-binding protein (PABC1; 604679). PAIP1 interacts with PABC1 and
some eIF4 complexes.

CLONING

By Far Western blot analysis of HeLa cell extracts and a placenta cDNA
library using a PABC1 probe, Craig et al. (1998) identified a cDNA
encoding PAIP1 (PABC1-interacting protein-1). Sequence analysis of the
deduced 480-amino acid PAIP1 protein predicted that it shares 39% amino
acid similarity with the central portion of eIF4G, which contains an
eIF4A-binding region. PAIP1 also contains a proline-rich N terminus.
SDS-PAGE analysis determined that PAIP1 is expressed as a 70-kD protein.

GENE FUNCTION

Binding analysis by Craig et al. (1998) showed that PAIP1 binds strongly
to poly(A) only in the presence of PABC1. Immunoprecipitation and
Western blot analysis demonstrated that in HeLa extracts, the C terminus
of PAIP1 interacts with PABC1, and PAIP1 interacts with eIF4A but not
eIF4G complexes.

AU-rich elements and protein-coding determinants direct rapid removal of
poly(A) tails as a necessary first step in mRNA decay. Grosset et al.
(2000) determined that 5 proteins form a multiprotein complex associated
with the major protein-coding-region determinant of instability (mCRD)
of the FOS gene (164810): PABP, HNRNPD (601324), PAIP1, NSAP1, and UNR
(191510). Overexpression of these proteins stabilized mCRD-containing
mRNA by impeding deadenylation.

605754	TITLE *605754 PHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL GLYCAN, CLASS Q; PIGQ
DESCRIPTION Many eukaryotic proteins are anchored to the membrane through the
hydrocarbon chains of a covalently bound glycosylphosphatidylinositol
(GPI) membrane anchor. GPI anchoring is important for regulation of cell
growth and activation. GPI biosynthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum
(ER) is initiated by transfer of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) from
UDP-GlcNAc to phosphatidylinositol (PI). This transfer is catalyzed by
GlcNAc transferase (GPI-GnT) and enzyme activity requires several genes
including PIGA (311770), PIGC (601730), and PIGH (600154) in mammals and
Gpi1, Gpi2 (PIGC homolog), and Gpi3 (PIGA homolog) in yeast. PIGQ is
involved in the first step of GPI biosynthesis (Tiede et al., 1998).

CLONING

In a database search for homologs of yeast Gpi1, Tiede et al. (1998) and
Watanabe et al. (1998) identified PIGQ, which they called hGPI1. The
full-length PIGQ cDNA encodes a deduced 581-amino acid protein that
shares 24% overall amino acid identity with yeast Gpi1. The C-terminal
half of PIGQ is better conserved than the N-terminal half. Watanabe et
al. (1998) predicted that PIGQ has several hydrophobic regions, some of
which may be transmembrane domains, and a potential tyrosine
phosphorylation site in the third cytoplasmic loop. Tiede et al. (1998)
predicted that most of the amino acids and conserved residues are on the
cytoplasmic face of the ER and that there are no significant domains in
the lumen of the ER. Tiede et al. (1998) and Hong et al. (1999)
independently cloned the mouse PIGQ homolog, which shares 85 to 89%
amino acid identity with human PIGQ.

GENE FUNCTION

Using immunoprecipitation experiments, Watanabe et al. (1998)
demonstrated that PIGQ associates specifically with PIGA, PIGC, and PIGH
and that all 4 proteins form a complex that has GPI-GnT activity in
vitro. The authors concluded that these 4 proteins form part or all of
GPI-GnT.

By expressing the mouse and human PIGQ in Gpi1-deficient S. cerevisiae,
Tiede et al. (1998) demonstrated that PIGQ specifically rescues S.
cerevisiae Gpi1 mutants, indicating that mouse and human PIGQ are indeed
orthologs of yeast Gpi1 and that there is a high degree of evolutionary
conservation in GPI biosynthesis. Tiede et al. (1998) concluded that
PIGQ is involved in the first step of GPI biosynthesis and that the
specific function of PIGQ may be to stabilize the enzyme complex in the
ER rather than to participate in catalysis of GlcNAc transfer.

GENE STRUCTURE

By comparing cDNA and genomic sequence, Hong et al. (1999) predicted
that PIGQ is encoded by 11 exons.

MAPPING

Using fluorescence in situ hybridization, Hong et al. (1999) mapped the
PIGQ gene to chromosome 16p13.3.

ANIMAL MODEL

Hong et al. (1999) disrupted the mouse Gpi1 gene in F9 embryonal
carcinoma cells, which caused a severe but not complete defect in the
generation of GPI-anchored proteins. A complex of Piga, Pigh, and Pigc
decreased to a nearly undetectable level, whereas a complex of Piga and
Pigh was easily detected. A lack of Gpi1 also caused partial decreases
of Pigc and Pigh. Therefore, GPI1 stabilizes the enzyme by tying up Pigc
with a complex of Piga and Pigh.

610925	TITLE *610925 INTERLEUKIN 17 RECEPTOR C; IL17RC
;;INTERLEUKIN 17 RECEPTOR-LIKE PROTEIN; IL17RL
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

IL17RC is widely expressed in nonleukocyte tissues and forms a
heteromeric receptor for IL17 (603149) with IL17R (IL17RA; 605461)
(Haudenschild et al., 2002; Toy et al., 2006).

CLONING

By searching databases for sequences with homology to IL17R,
Haudenschild et al. (2002) identified IL17RC, which they termed IL17RL.
The predicted full-length 720-amino acid protein has an N-terminal
signal peptide, followed by an acidic extracellular domain with 9
potential N-glycosylation sites, a single-pass transmembrane domain, and
a basic cytoplasmic region with multiple phosphorylation sites. It has a
calculated molecular mass of 76.4 kD and shares 22% amino acid identity
with IL17R. By database analysis, Haudenschild et al. (2002) identified
numerous IL17RL splice variants with the potential to produce at least
12 protein isoforms, including both transmembrane receptors and soluble
decoy receptors. Northern blot analysis detected strongest expression in
prostate, kidney, liver, heart, and muscle, with barely detectable
levels in thymus and peripheral blood leukocytes. The major transcript
was 2.5 kb, and diffuse bands between 2.1 and 3.1 kb were also detected.
Quantitative RT-PCR analysis demonstrated frequent absence of exon 7,
possibly in a tissue-specific manner. Immunoblot analysis showed
multiple bands of 33 to 60 kD, suggesting the presence of numerous
IL17RL isoforms. Immunohistochemical analysis indicated expression in
skeletal muscle, prostate, kidney, and placenta. Prostate cancers showed
decreased reactivity in epithelial cells and increased reactivity in
stromal regions relative to normal prostate.

GENE FUNCTION

Using flow cytometric, ELISA, immunoprecipitation, and Western blot
analyses, Toy et al. (2006) showed that expression of both human IL17RA
and IL17RC on Il17ra-deficient mouse fibroblasts was necessary for
either human IL17 or IL17F (606496) to fully bind cells and induce
secretion of CXCL1 (155730). Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed a
physical association between IL17RA and IL17RC. Toy et al. (2006)
concluded that the functional IL17R is a heteromeric complex consisting
of at least IL17RA and IL17RC.

GENE STRUCTURE

Haudenschild et al. (2002) determined that the IL17RC gene contains 19
exons and spans 16.6 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Haudenschild et al. (2002) mapped the
IL17RC gene to chromosome 3p25.3-p24.1.

;;NEUROPATHY TARGET ESTERASE; NTE;;
NEUROTOXIC ESTERASE
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Covalent modification of neuropathy target esterase (NTE) by certain
organophosphorus esters (OPs) leads, after a delay of several days, to a
degeneration of long axons in the spinal cord and peripheral nerves.
Lush et al. (1998) determined a partial protein sequence of pig NTE.
They searched an EST database and identified a human cDNA that encodes a
polypeptide showing homology to 1 of the pig NTE peptides. Using this
cDNA as a probe, the authors screened a human fetal brain cDNA library
and isolated a cDNA containing the entire NTE coding sequence. The
deduced 1,327-amino acid protein contains 4 predicted transmembrane
domains and multiple potential sites for N- and O-linked glycosylation.
SDS-PAGE and biochemical analyses showed that human NTE is a
glycoprotein with an apparent molecular mass of 155 kD. NTE shares 41%
amino acid sequence identity with the Drosophila 'Swiss Cheese' (Sws)
protein, which is involved in the regulation of interactions between
neurons and glia in the developing fly brain.

MAPPING

In the positional cloning of the mucolipidosis IV gene (MCOLN1; 605248),
which maps to 19p13.3-p13.2, Bargal et al. (2000) found that the NTE
gene is located in this region. They analyzed all 33 coding exons of
this gene in 6 mucolipidosis IV patients and identified no mutations.

By FISH, Winrow et al. (2003) demonstrated that the Nte locus maps to
mouse chromosome 8A1.1 and the human NTE gene maps to 19p13.3.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

The pathogenesis of organophosphorous (OP) compound-induced delayed
neuropathy (OPIDN) involves neuropathy target esterase (NTE), a neuronal
membrane protein, either through direct OP-induced inhibition of NTE or
through generation of OP-NTE neurotoxic complexes ('aged NTE'). Rainier
et al. (2008) described 2 families, one consanguineous, in which
affected subjects exhibited progressive spastic paraplegia and distal
muscle wasting (SPG39; 612020). Affected subjects resembled those with
OPIDN and those with Troyer syndrome (275900) due to SPG20 (607111) gene
mutation. The latter possibility was excluded by genetic linkage and
sequence analysis of the SPG20 gene. Genomewide analysis suggested
linkage to a 22-cM homozygous locus on 19p13 to which NTE had been
mapped. NTE was a candidate because of its role in OPIDN and the
similarity of the patients to those with OPIDN. Affected subjects in the
consanguineous kindred were homozygous for a disease-specific NTE
mutation, 3034A-G, that disrupted an interspecies-conserved residue in
NTE's catalytic domain (M1012V; 603197.0001). Affected subjects in the
nonconsanguineous family were compound heterozygotes: 1 allele carried a
2669G-A mutation that disrupted an interspecies-conserved residue in
NTE's catalytic domain (R890H; 603197.0002), and the other allele had an
insertion that caused frameshift and protein truncation (603197.0003).
Disease-specific, nonconserved NTE mutations in unrelated patients with
motor neuron disease (MND) indicated the importance of NTE in
maintaining axonal integrity, raised the possibility that NTE pathway
disturbances contribute to other MNDs including amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis (ALS; see 105400), and supported the role of NTE abnormalities
in axonopathy produced by neuropathic OP compounds.

ANIMAL MODEL

NTE is involved in neuronal development and is the target for
neurodegeneration induced by selected organophosphorus pesticides and
chemical warfare agents. Winrow et al. (2003) generated mice with
disruption in Nte. Nte -/- mice died after embryonic day 8, and
heterozygous Nte +/- mice had lower activity of Nte in the brain and
higher mortality when exposed to an Nte-inhibiting compound (EOPF) than
did wildtype mice. Nte +/- and wildtype mice treated with 1 mg per kg of
body weight of EOPF had elevated motor activity, showing that even minor
reduction of Nte activity leads to hyperactivity. Studies showed that
genetic or chemical reduction of Nte activity results in a neurologic
phenotype of hyperactivity in mammals and indicated that EOPF toxicity
occurs directly through inhibition of Nte without the requirement for
Nte gain of function or aging.

O'Callaghan (2003) interpreted the significance of the studies of Winrow
et al. (2003) in relation to the toxicity of organophosphates, which
have long been used as pesticides and which are a concern because of
their potential use as chemical warfare agents. As a class of compounds,
organophosphate esters inhibit serine-containing esterases owing to
phosphorylation of serine residues at the active site of these enzymes,
the most notable of which is acetylcholinesterase (100740). Most
features of the acute toxicity of these compounds relate to their
inhibition of this enzyme. A less well known feature of some
organophosphates is their propensity to cause a delayed neuropathy that
has been termed organophosphate-induced delayed neurotoxicity (OPIDN).
This is a progressive neurologic condition characterized by weakness,
ataxia, and subsequent paralysis of the limbs. The major neuropathologic
hallmarks of OPIDN are degeneration of the long exons of the spinal cord
and peripheral neurons. The proposed target for initiation of OPIDN has
been NTE. The mechanistic basis for initiation of OPIDN through NTE was
thought to involve the generation of an 'aged' form of the enzyme. The
work of Winrow et al. (2003) provided evidence against the aging concept
without ruling out involvement of NTE itself. Mice deficient in the
enzyme should be less susceptible to toxicity, but the opposite turned
out to be the case.

Moser et al. (2004) observed lethality in Nte-null mouse embryos after
gastrulation at embryonic day 9 postcoitum. As early as embryonic day
7.5, mutant embryos showed growth retardation which did not reflect
impaired cell proliferation but resulted from failed placental
development; as a consequence, massive apoptosis within the developing
embryo preceded its resorption. Histologic analysis indicated that NTE
is essential for the formation of the labyrinth layer and the survival
and differentiation of secondary giant cells. Impaired vasculogenesis in
the yolk sacs and embryos of null mutant conceptuses suggested that NTE
is also required for normal blood vessel development.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA 39, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
PNPLA6, MET1012VAL

In a consanguineous family of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry, Rainier et al.
(2008) demonstrated an association between motor neuron disease (SPG39;
612020) and homozygosity for a missense mutation in the NTE gene:
3034A-G, met1012 to val (M1012V).

.0002
SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA 39, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
NTE, ARG890HIS

In a nonconsanguineous family, Rainier et al. (2008) found that motor
neuron disease (SPG39; 612020) was associated with compound
heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the NTE gene. On 1 allele the 2
affected individuals carried a G-to-A transition at cDNA position 2669
that resulted in substitution of histidine for arginine at codon 890
(R890H); the other allele carried a 4-bp insertion (603197.0003). The
affected individuals were brother and sister, and inherited the missense
mutation from the father and the insertion from the mother.

.0003
SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA 39, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
NTE, 4-BP INS, 2946CAGC

The 2 affected individuals with motor neuron disease (SPG39; 612020) in
the nonconsanguineous family described by Rainier et al. (2008) carried
a 4-bp insertion on the maternal allele, 2946_2947insCAGC, that caused
frameshift and protein truncation (S982fs1019). The paternal allele
carried a missense mutation (603197.0002).

CADHERIN 21, FORMERLY; CDH21, FORMERLY
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Cadherins are calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion molecules, and
protocadherins constitute a subfamily of nonclassic cadherins. PCDHGA12
is 1 of 22 tandemly arranged genes within the PCDHG gene cluster
(604968) on chromosome 5q31. The 22 PCDHG genes function as 'variable'
exons that are individually spliced to a downstream constant region to
form distinct PCDHG transcripts. The variable PCDHG exons encode the
extracellular and transmembrane domains of the protocadherin protein,
and the common region encodes the intracellular domain (Wu et al.,
2001). For further information on the PCDHG genes, see 604968.

CLONING

To elucidate the molecular basis of fibroblast cell-cell adhesion,
Matsuyoshi and Imamura (1997) investigated cadherin expression in human
fibroblasts by RT-PCR using degenerate primers based on well-conserved
amino acid sequences of cadherins. They isolated a partial cDNA encoding
PCDHGA12, which they called FIB3. RT-PCR analysis revealed that FIB3 is
expressed at low levels in fibroblasts and keratinocytes but not in
melanocytes.

By screening a brain cDNA library for genes with the potential to encode
large proteins, Nagase et al. (1998) identified a cDNA encoding
PCDHGA12, which they termed KIAA0588. The 932-amino acid protein, which
is 70% identical PCDHGA8 (606295), is predicted to be involved in cell
signaling. RT-PCR analysis detected ubiquitous expression that was weak
only in spleen.

By PCR of a brain cDNA library, Wu and Maniatis (1999) cloned
full-length PCDHGA12.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Wu et al. (2001) mapped the PCDHGA12 gene
to chromosome 5q31, between 2 pseudogenes, one adjacent to the PCDHGB7
gene (606304) and other adjacent to the PCDHGC3 gene (603627). They
localized the mouse PCDHG genes to chromosome 18c.

602933	TITLE *602933 THYROID HORMONE RECEPTOR INTERACTOR 6; TRIP6
;;OPA-INTERACTING PROTEIN 1; OIP1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) are hormone-dependent transcription
factors that regulate expression of a variety of specific target genes.
Lee et al. (1995) used a modified yeast 2-hybrid screen to identify
proteins that interact with the ligand-binding domain of rat Tr-beta-1
(THRB; 190160). They recovered HeLa cell cDNAs encoding a number of
different TR-interacting proteins, or TRIPs. One of the proteins, TRIP6,
contains 2 LIM domains (see 601329) and is similar to zyxin (602002).
Northern blot analysis detected a 1.8-kb TRIP6 mRNA in several tissues,
with highest expression in kidney, liver, and lung.

Yi and Beckerle (1998) stated that the cDNA recovered by Lee et al.
(1995) was incomplete. They reported that the predicted full-length
protein contains 476 amino acids and has 3 tandemly arrayed C-terminal
LIM domains and a proline-rich N-terminal region. The amino acid
sequence of TRIP6 displays 35% and 50% identity to those of zyxin and
LPP (600700), respectively.

GENE FUNCTION

Lee et al. (1995) found that TRIP6 interacted with TR-beta only in the
presence of thyroid hormone.

Neisseria gonorrhoeae opacity-associated (Opa) proteins are a family of
outer membrane proteins involved in gonococcal adherence to and invasion
of human cells. In a yeast 2-hybrid screen to identify human epithelial
cell proteins that interact with Opa proteins, Williams et al. (1998)
isolated HeLa cell cDNAs encoding TRIP6, or OIP1 (Opa-interacting
protein-1).

Salmonella typhimurium-infected phagocytes traverse the gastrointestinal
epithelium and enter the bloodstream within minutes after ingestion,
thereby spreading throughout the host. By yeast 2-hybrid analysis,
Worley et al. (2006) found that S. typhimurium srfH, a secreted type III
effector, interacted with the LIM domain of human TRIP6. Deconvolution
microscopy demonstrated diffuse cytoplasmic colocalization of srfH and
Trip6 in murine macrophages. Bacteria lacking SrfH were unable to
stimulate TRIP6-dependent phagocyte migration in vitro or in vivo. Mice
lacking Cd18 (ITGB2; 600065) and infected with Salmonella did not show
phagocyte migration, in spite of diminished bactericidal function.
Worley et al. (2006) concluded that TRIP6 functions in both inflammatory
and cell motility pathways.

MAPPING

By analysis of a radiation hybrid panel, Yi and Beckerle (1998) mapped
the TRIP6 gene to 7q22.

607170	TITLE *607170 CYSTEINE-RICH PROTEIN WITH EGF-LIKE DOMAINS 1; CRELD1
;;CIRRIN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Epidermal growth factor (EGF; 131530)-like repeats are a class of
cysteine-rich domains that mediate interactions between proteins of
diverse function. EGF domains are found in proteins that are either
completely secreted or have transmembrane regions that tether the
protein to the cell surface. CRELD1 is the founding member of a family
of matricellular proteins.

CLONING

By screening EST clones mapped to chromosome 3p25-p24.2, Rupp et al.
(2002) identified CRELD1, which shows sequence similarity to
extracellular matrix proteins. The full-length clone encodes a deduced
420-amino acid protein. Structural analysis suggested that CRELD1 is a
cell adhesion molecule that contains an N-terminal signal sequence; 2
type III transmembrane domains separated by a short cytoplasmic loop; a
tandem array of EGF-like repeats; and a region rich in glutamate and
tryptophan residues (WE domain). It also has 2 putative N-linked
glycosylation sites and several possible serine, threonine, and tyrosine
phosphorylation sites. Utilization of an alternative exon 9 (exon 9b
within intron 9) results in a protein with a unique C terminus that has
no predicted transmembrane domain. Rupp et al. (2002) also cloned the
cow and mouse orthologs of CRELD1, which share 94% and 92% amino acid
identity with human CRELD1, respectively. Database analysis revealed
that the CRELD1 gene is highly conserved across species, including
Drosophila and C. elegans.

Using Northern blot analysis, Rupp et al. (2002) detected ubiquitous
expression of a major 2.1-kb CRELD1 transcript, with highest expression
in fetal lung, liver, and kidney, and in adult heart, brain, and
skeletal muscle. Adult brain also showed an alternative transcript of
2.5 kb, and several heart regions showed an additional transcript of 2.3
kb. By Northern array analysis, Rupp et al. (2002) determined that the
variant that utilizes exon 9b is expressed in adult brain, thymus, lymph
node, and several areas of the gastrointestinal tract, and in fetal
spleen, thymus, and lung. In situ hybridization in developing chick
embryos revealed expression of Creld1 at all time points and localized
high levels of expression in the developing heart, limb buds, mandible,
branchial arches, and brain.

GENE STRUCTURE

Rupp et al. (2002) determined that the CRELD1 gene contains 11 exons
spanning approximately 12 kb. The major 2.1-kb transcript utilizes exons
1 through 10. There are repetitive elements (SINE and LINE class) in
introns 1, 2, 3, 4, and 9 and a simple hexanucleotide repeat in intron
6.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis and analysis of a BAC contig, Rupp et al.
(2002) mapped the CRELD1 gene to chromosome 3p25.3. Radiation hybrid
analysis localized the mouse Creld1 gene to distal chromosome 6, which
shows homology of synteny with human chromosome 3p25.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Rupp et al. (2002) noted that the CRELD1 gene is in a region of loss of
heterozygosity for several types of cancer.

In a patient with an isolated atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD2;
606217), Robinson et al. (2003) identified an arg329-to-cys mutation
(R329C; 607170.0001) in the CRELD1 gene, which was present but not
expressed in the proband's father, brother, or sister. These findings
were consistent with previous observations of incomplete penetrance in
AVSD (Pierpont et al., 2000). Given the low penetrance observed in this
family, Robinson et al. (2003) proposed that CRELD1 is an AVSD
susceptibility gene and that CRELD1 mutations increase the risk of
developing a heart defect, rather than being directly causative. In 2
other patients, Robinson et al. (2003) identified thr311-to-ile (T311I;
607170.0002) and arg107-to-his (R107H; 607170.0003) mutations,
respectively.

Among 49 patients with AVSD, Zatyka et al. (2005) identified 5 novel
sequence variants in the CRELD1 gene. Three of the novel variants were
also identified in normal controls, 1 was a silent change, and 1 was
also seen in 2 family members without congenital heart disease
(607170.0004). Genetic analysis of 12 patients with 3p- syndrome
(613792) showed that the CRELD1 gene was deleted in all 5 patients with
an AVSD but was also deleted in 4 patients without congenital heart
disease. Zatyka et al. (2005) concluded that CRELD1 deletions are
unlikely to account for AVSD in children with 3p deletions but that rare
missense mutations may confer susceptibility to AVSD in a subset of
patients.

Because trisomy 21 (190685) is by far the most common finding associated
with AVSD, Maslen et al. (2006) analyzed the CRELD1 gene in 39
individuals with Down syndrome and complete AVSD. They identified
heterozygosity for missense mutations in 2 infants (607170.0001 and
607170.0005, respectively), and suggested that defects in CRELD1 may
contribute to the pathogenesis of AVSD in the context of trisomy 21.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
ATRIOVENTRICULAR SEPTAL DEFECT, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, 2
CRELD1, ARG329CYS

In an individual with an isolated partial atrioventricular septal defect
(606217), Robinson et al. (2003) identified a heterozygous 4201C-T
transition in exon 9 of the CRELD1 gene, resulting in an arg329-to-cys
(R329C) substitution in the second cb-EGF domain. The addition of a free
cysteine residue to a cb-EGF domain disrupted its disulfide bonding
pattern. The mutation was inherited from the father who, like a brother
and sister of the proband who also carried the mutation, did not report
having a heart defect. Special studies likewise showed structurally
normal hearts. These findings were consistent with previous observations
of incomplete penetrance in AVSD (Pierpont et al., 2000).

In an infant with Down syndrome (190685) and complete atrioventricular
septal defect, Maslen et al. (2006) identified heterozygosity for the
R329C mutation. The infant also had patent ductus arteriosus, tricuspid
regurgitation, anomalous hepatic drainage to the right atrium, and
pulmonary hypertension. The mutation was inherited from the mother, a
normal euploid individual with no evidence of a heart defect. The
mutation was not found in 30 individuals with Down syndrome and no heart
defect by echocardiography.

Ackerman et al. (2012) identified this mutation in 2 individuals with
Down syndrome and atrioventricular septal defect. The mutation was not
seen in 141 controls who had Down syndrome but no AVSD.

.0002
ATRIOVENTRICULAR SEPTAL DEFECT, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, 2
CRELD1, THR311ILE

In an individual with an isolated partial atrioventricular septal defect
(606217), Robinson et al. (2003) identified a heterozygous 4148C-T
transition in exon 9 of the CRELD1 gene, resulting in a thr311-to-ile
(T311I) mutation in the second cb-EGF domain.

.0003
ATRIOVENTRICULAR SEPTAL DEFECT, PARTIAL, WITH HETEROTAXY SYNDROME
CRELD1, ARG107HIS

In a patient of mixed Hispanic and African American descent with partial
atrioventricular septal defect and features of heterotaxy syndrome
(dextrocardia, right ventricle aorta with pulmonary atresia, and right
aortic arch) (see 606217), Robinson et al. (2003) identified a
heterozygous 1566G-A transition in exon 3 of the CRELD1 gene, resulting
in an arg107-to-his (R107H) mutation in the highly conserved WE domain
of the gene. No extracardiac abnormalities were detected.

.0004
ATRIOVENTRICULAR SEPTAL DEFECT, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, 2
CRELD1, PRO162ALA

In a patient with sporadic partial atrioventricular septal defect
(600309) and a 47,XXX karyotype, Zatyka et al. (2005) identified a
484C-G transversion in exon 5 of the CRELD1 gene, resulting in a
pro162-to-ala (P162A) substitution. The mutation was not identified in
200 control chromosomes but was found in the patient's mother and
maternal grandmother, neither of whom had congenital heart disease.
Zatyka et al. (2005) suggested that the P162A mutation, if causative,
showed reduced penetrance.

.0005
ATRIOVENTRICULAR SEPTAL DEFECT, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, 2
CRELD1, GLU414LYS

In an infant with Down syndrome (190685) and complete balanced
atrioventricular septal defect and tricuspid regurgitation, Maslen et
al. (2006) identified heterozygosity for a 1240G-A transition in exon 10
of the CRELD1 gene, resulting in a glu414-to-lys (E414K) substitution.
The mutation was not found in either parent, in 400 race-relevant
chromosomes, or in 30 individuals with Down syndrome and no heart defect
by echocardiography.

Ackerman et al. (2012) identified this mutation in 1 patient with Down
syndrome and AVSD; it was not identified in 141 individuals with Down
syndrome and no congenital heart defect.

;;HIGH MOBILITY GROUP PROTEIN 4; HMG4;;
NONHISTONE CHROMOSOMAL PROTEIN HMG4;;
CHROMOSOMAL PROTEIN, NONHISTONE, HMG4;;
HMG2A
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

HMGB3 belongs to the high mobility group (HMG) protein superfamily. Like
HMG1 (163905) and HMG2 (163906), HMGB3 contains DNA-binding HMG box
domains and is classified into the HMG box subfamily. Members of the HMG
box subfamily are thought to play a fundamental role in DNA replication,
nucleosome assembly and transcription (Wilke et al., 1997; Nemeth et
al., 2006).

CLONING

Using direct cDNA selection to identify genes located in human
chromosome Xq28, Wilke et al. (1997) cloned cDNAs encoding the human
homolog of chicken Hmg2a. The predicted 199-amino acid human protein
shares 97%, 88%, and 86% identity with chicken Hmg2a, human HMG1, and
human HMG2, respectively. Like HMG1 and HMG2, human HMG2A contains 2 HMG
box repeats and an acidic C-terminal domain. Northern blot analysis
revealed that HMG2A is expressed predominantly in placenta as 1.2- and
1.7-kb mRNAs. Wilke et al. (1997) also identified ESTs corresponding to
the mouse HMG2a homolog.

Independently, Vaccari et al. (1998) isolated mouse and human cDNAs
corresponding to HGM2A, which they called HMG4. They reported that the
deduced mouse and human proteins contain 200 amino acids and are 97%
identical. Northern blot and RT-PCR analyses suggested that mouse Hmg4
transcripts are much more abundant in embryonic than in adult tissues.

Nemeth et al. (2003) found that Hmgb3 was preferentially expressed in
mouse hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and that it was expressed in adult
mouse bone marrow cells.

GENE FUNCTION

By introducing a retrovirus containing Hmgb3 into mouse bone marrow
cells, Nemeth et al. (2003) found that enforced expression of Hmgb3
inhibited B-cell and myeloid differentiation. They concluded that
downregulation of HMGB3 protein levels is an important step for myeloid
and B-cell differentiation.

Using pull-down assays, Yanai et al. (2009) found that mouse HMGB
proteins bound to all immunogenic nucleic acids, with a correlation
between affinity and immunogenicity. Hmgb1 -/- and Hmgb2 -/- mouse cells
were defective in type I interferon and inflammatory cytokine induction
by DNA or RNA targeted to activate cytosolic nucleic acid-sensing
receptors. Mouse cells in which expression of Hmgb1, Hmgb2, and Hmgb3
was suppressed by small interfering RNA also had impaired activation of
transcription factors Irf3 (603734) and Nfkb (see 164011). The lack of
HMGBs also resulted in poorer activation of Toll-like receptor-3 (Tlr3;
603029), Tlr7 (300365), and Tlr9 (605474) by their cognate nucleic acids
(dsRNA, ssRNA, and hypomethylated DNA, respectively). Yanai et al.
(2009) concluded that selective activation of nucleic acid-sensing
receptors is contingent on the more promiscuous sensing of nucleic acids
by HMGBs and may have implications for the treatment of immunologic
disorders.

ANIMAL MODEL

Nemeth et al. (2006) noted that mice deficient in Hmgb3 (Hmgb3 -/Y mice)
have normal numbers of HSCs that are capable of renewal and
hematopoietic repopulation, but they have fewer common lymphoid
progenitor (CLP) and common myeloid progenitor (CMP) cells. Nemeth et
al. (2006) found that wildtype and Hmgb3 -/Y CLPs and CMPs proliferated
and differentiated equally in vitro, but Hmgb3 -/Y HSCs exhibited
constitutive activation of the canonical Wnt (see WNT1; 164820)
signaling pathway that corresponded to increased expression of Dvl1
(601365), a positive Wnt regulator. Hmgb3 -/Y mice stressed by
5-fluorouracil treatment recovered functional HSCs more rapidly than
wildtype mice and more rapidly than they recovered CLPs and CMPs. Nemeth
et al. (2006) proposed that increased Wnt signaling in Hmgb3 -/Y mice
may allow faster HSC recovery. They concluded that HMGB3 is required for
proper balance between HSC self-renewal and differentiation into
leukocyte progenitors.

600935	TITLE *600935 POTASSIUM CHANNEL, INWARDLY RECTIFYING, SUBFAMILY J, MEMBER 8; KCNJ8
;;INWARDLY RECTIFYING POTASSIUM CHANNEL Kir6.1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Inagaki et al. (1995) isolated a cDNA from a rat pancreatic islet cell
library that encodes a member of the inward rectifier potassium channel
family. The predicted 424-amino acid protein, which they designated
uKATP-1, has 2 transmembrane domains and shares 43 to 46% identity with
other inward rectifier potassium channels, including ROMK1 (600359),
IRK1 (600681), GIRK1 (601534), and cKATP-1 (600734). When the protein
was expressed in Xenopus oocytes, a weak rectifier activity was
demonstrated that was blocked with Ba(+2) and activated by diazoxide.
Northern blots showed that the mRNA is widely expressed in various
tissues of the rat. Inagaki et al. (1995) cloned the human gene,
designated KCNJ8. The predicted human protein is 98% identical to that
of the rat.

GENE STRUCTURE

Inagaki et al. (1995) showed that the KCNJ8 gene contains 3 exons
spanning approximately 10 kb.

MAPPING

Inagaki et al. (1995) mapped the KCNJ8 gene to 12p11.23 by fluorescence
in situ hybridization.

ANIMAL MODEL

Miki et al. (2002) found that mice lacking the Kir6.1 gene had a high
rate of sudden death associated with spontaneous ST elevation followed
by atrioventricular block, as seen on the electrocardiogram. The
potassium channel opener pinacidil did not induce potassium channels in
vascular smooth muscle cells of Kir6.1-null mice, and there was no
vasodilation response to pinacidil. Administration of methylergometrine,
a vasoconstrictive agent, elicited ST elevation followed by cardiac
death in Kir6.1-null mice but not in wildtype mice, indicating a
phenotype characterized by hypercontractility of coronary arteries and
resembling Prinzmetal (or variant) angina in humans (Prinzmetal et al.,
1959). Prinzmetal angina occurs exclusively at rest and is associated
with elevation of ST segments on EKG during the attack. Although the
attack disappears spontaneously in most cases, it can lead to myocardial
infarction, severe AV block, life-threatening ventricular tachycardia,
and sudden death if the coronary vasospasm is prolonged (MacAlpin,
1993). The elevated ST segments on EKG during the attack are diagnostic,
as is induction of coronary spasm by ergot alkaloids or acetylcholine.
Vasospastic angina is more common in Japanese than in Caucasians
(Beltrame et al., 1999; Pristipino et al., 2000). Miki et al. (2002)
concluded that the Kir6.1-containing potassium channel is critical in
the regulation of vascular tone, especially in the coronary arteries,
and its disruption may cause Prinzmetal angina. They suggested that it
will be important to learn whether genetic differences in the KIR6.1
gene are associated with Prinzmetal angina in various populations.

From a screen of N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU)-mutagenized mice, Croker et
al. (2007) identified a mutation causing both profound susceptibility to
infection by mouse cytomegalovirus and a sensitization of approximately
20,000-fold to lipopolysaccharide, poly(I.C), and immunostimulatory
(CpG) DNA. The LPS hypersensitivity phenotype was not suppressed by
mutations in other genes contributing to LPS responses, and resulted
from an abnormality extrinsic to hematopoietic cells. The phenotype was
due to a null allele of Kcnj8, encoding Kir6.1, a protein that combines
with SUR2 (601439) to form an ATP-sensitive potassium channel expressed
in coronary artery smooth muscle and endothelial cells. In Drosophila
melanogaster, Croker et al. (2007) found that suppression of dSUR by RNA
interference similarly caused hypersensitivity to infection by flock
house virus. Thus, K(ATP) evolved to serve a homeostatic function during
infection, an in mammals it prevents coronary artery vasoconstriction
induced by cytokines dependent on Toll-like receptor (TLR; see 601194)
and/or MDA5 (606951) immunoreceptors.

609453	TITLE *609453 GOLGI AUTOANTIGEN, GOLGIN SUBFAMILY A, 7; GOLGA7
;;GOLGI COMPLEX-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN, 16-KD; GCP16
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using an N-terminal domain of GCP170 (GOLGA3; 602581) as bait in a yeast
2-hybrid screen of a HeLa cell cDNA library, Ohta et al. (2003) cloned
GOLGA7, which they designated GCP16. The deduced 137-amino acid protein
has a calculated molecular mass of 16 kD. GCP16 contains a short
coiled-coil domain. Northern blot analysis detected a 2.0-kb transcript
in all tissues examined, with abundant expression in testis, ovary, and
spleen. A similarity search revealed GCP16 homologs in mouse, nematode,
and fly, but not in yeast and plants. Immunoelectron microscopy detected
GCP16 associated with the Golgi stack and related structures. SDS-PAGE
detected endogenous GCP16 at an apparent molecular mass of 16 kD.

By searching databases for homologs of S. pombe Erf4, Swarthout et al.
(2005) identified GCP16. Northern blot analysis detected a 1.9-kb
transcript in all human tissues examined except colon and thymus.
Confocal microscopy of transfected human embryonic kidney cells showed
colocalization of epitope-tagged GCP16 with DHHC9 (ZDHHC9; 300646) at
the Golgi apparatus

GENE FUNCTION

By coimmunoprecipitation of HeLa cell extracts, Ohta et al. (2003)
confirmed that native GCP16 and GCP170 interact. Overexpression of GCP16
in COS-1 cells inhibited protein transport from the Golgi to the cell
surface.

Swarthout et al. (2005) found that DHHC9 and GCP16 coimmunoprecipitated
in transfected human embryonic kidney cells. Following expression in
insect cells, the DHHC9/GCP16 complex showed protein acyltransferase
activity, leading to incorporation of radioactive palmitate into both
DHHC9 and an HRAS (190020) substrate. Both autoacylation of DHHC9 and
palmitoylation of HRAS depended upon the presence of GCP16 in the
complex, and no activity was observed when the conserved cys169 of the
DHHC motif of DHHC9 was mutated to serine. The purified DHHC9/GCP16
complex also showed protein acyltransferase activity with an NRAS
(164790) substrate, but not with substrates containing N-terminal
palmitoylation motifs. DHHC9 appeared to require GCP16 for protein
stability.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Despite the absence of a hydrophobic domain, Ohta et al. (2003) found
that GCP16 behaved as an integral Golgi membrane protein following
treatment with brefeldin A. Mutation analysis of GCP16 carrying
radiolabeled palmitic acid indicated that GCP16 is acylated at cys69 and
cys72, accounting for its tight association with the membrane. Mutant
proteins lacking one or the other acylation site retained Golgi membrane
targeting, but a mutant lacking both sites dispersed to the cytoplasm,
indicating that the acylation anchors GCP16 to Golgi membranes.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the GOLGA7
gene to chromosome 8 (TMAP RH66402).

600328	TITLE *600328 MIXED LINEAGE LEUKEMIA, TRANSLOCATED TO, 6; MLLT6
;;ALL1-FUSED GENE FROM CHROMOSOME 17; AF17
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Chromosome translocations involving the MLL (ALL1) gene (159555) on
chromosome 11q23 are associated with approximately 10% of patients with
acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and more than 5% of patients with
acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Leukemia associated with 11q23
abnormalities tend to show expression of both lymphoid and myeloid
markers (hence, 'mixed-lineage leukemia'), massive cell burden, and poor
prognosis (see 159555). Prasad et al. (1994) cloned and characterized
the AF17 gene as a translocation partner of MLL in the rare
translocation t(11;17)(q23;q21). The AF17 gene encodes a protein of
1,093 amino acids, containing a leucine-zipper dimerization motif
located 3-prime of the fusion point and a cysteine-rich domain at the N
terminus. The latter can be arranged in 3 zinc fingers and shows
homology to a domain within the protein Br140 (602410); see Thompson et
al. (1994). AF17 was found to contain stretches of amino acids
previously associated with domains involved in transcriptional
repression or activation.

GENE FUNCTION

Based on features of AF17 and of the proteins encoded by the other
partner genes of ALL1 that had been analyzed and in conjunction with
other studies, Prasad et al. (1994) proposed a model in which ALL1
rearrangements result in loss of function of that gene. In this model,
the partner polypeptide, such as that encoded by AF17, plays an
accessory role either by repressing activity of the truncated ALL1
protein or by blocking the function of the normal protein presumably
present in leukemic cells.

MAPPING

Prasad et al. (1994) identified the AF17 gene on chromosome 17q21.

614637	TITLE *614637 DESUMOYLATING ISOPEPTIDASE 1; DESI1
;;PPPDE PEPTIDASE DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 2; PPPDE2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The modification of proteins by small ubiquitin-like modifier, or SUMO
(see SUMO1; 601912), is crucial for the regulation of diverse cellular
processes. DESI1 is predicted to have a papain-like fold and to function
as a cysteine protease that removes SUMO from SUMO-modified proteins
(Shin et al., 2012).

CLONING

Shin et al. (2012) cloned mouse Desi1, which encodes a deduced 168-amino
acid protein with a central isopeptidase domain. By database analysis,
they identified the human and rat orthologs. Western blot analysis
detected Desi1 in all mouse tissues examined. Epitope-tagged Desi1
localized to the cytoplasm and nucleus of transfected 293T cells, and it
eluted as a dimer from a size-exclusion column.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis of a mouse T-cell lymphoma library, Shin et
al. (2012) found that Desi1 interacted with Bzel (ZBTB46; 614639).
Immunoprecipitation analysis of cotransfected 293T cells confirmed
direct interaction of Desi1 and Bzel. Desi1 desumoylated Bzel, but not
other sumoylated proteins tested, in a dose-dependent manner.
Desumoylation of Bzel reduced Bzel repressive activity against its
target, Blimp1 (PRDM1; 603423). Mutation analysis revealed that Desi1
desumoylation activity required catalytic cys108. Knockdown of DESI1 in
human and mouse cells resulted in elevated BZEL sumoylation and enhanced
repressor activity of BZEL toward BLIMP1. Desi1 also cleaved polymeric
Sumo2 (603042)/Sumo3 (602231) chains, but it did not function in Sumo1
C-terminal processing.

MAPPING

Hartz (2012) mapped the DESI1 gene to chromosome 22q13.2 based on an
alignment of the DESI1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF038183) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

612185	TITLE *612185 CASK-INTERACTING PROTEIN 2; CASKIN2
;;KIAA1139
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Hirosawa et al. (1999) cloned CASKIN2, which they designated
KIAA1139. The deduced protein contains motifs associated with cell
signaling. RT-PCR ELISA detected ubiquitous expression of CASKIN2, with
highest levels in fetal and adult liver.

By affinity purification of rat brain proteins with a GST fusion protein
of the N-terminal CaM kinase domain of CASK (300172), an adaptor protein
of the plasma membrane, Tabuchi et al. (2002) isolated a novel 180-kD
protein. By database analysis, they identified KIAA1306 (CASKIN1;
612184) as the cDNA encoding this protein as well as the highly related
CASKIN2 cDNA. Tabuchi et al. (2002) found that Caskin proteins are
highly conserved evolutionarily. Each has a multidomain structure in
which the N terminus has 6 ankyrin repeats, a single SH3 domain, and 2
SAM domains, and the C terminus contains a long proline-rich sequence
and a short conserved domain. Human CASKIN2 encodes a deduced
1,202-amino acid protein.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Hirosawa et al. (1999) mapped the CASKIN2
gene to chromosome 17.

613260	TITLE *613260 KERATINOCYTE PROLINE-RICH PROTEIN; KPRP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using suppression subtractive hybridization to identify cDNA clones
induced by calcium in normal human epidermal keratinocytes, followed by
5-prime and 3-prime RACE, Lee et al. (2005) cloned KPRP. The deduced
579-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 64 kD. It has
a glutamine-rich N-terminal half, a proline-rich C-terminal half, and 8
putative N-myristoylation sites. Northern blot analysis of mouse tissues
detected Kprp expression in stomach and skin. In situ hybridization
revealed KPRP expression in the upper granular layer of differentiated
normal human skin. In human fetal skin, KPRP expression began in the
periderm at 16 weeks' estimated gestational age (EGA), and it was
expressed in the granular and horny layers of the epidermis at 24 weeks'
EGA and thereafter. In mice, expression began at embryonic day 17.5.
Western blot analysis detected KPRP at an apparent molecular mass of 70
kD.

GENE FUNCTION

Lee et al. (2005) found that elevated intracellular calcium resulted in
a time-dependent increase in KPRP expression in normal human epidermal
keratinocytes. Expression of KPRP was elevated in psoriatic lesions
compared with normal skin.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Lee et al. (2005) mapped the KPRP gene to
the epidermal differentiation complex on chromosome 1q21.

;;G PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTOR-INTERACTING PROTEIN; GIP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using the second intracellular loop of V2R (AVPR2; 300538) as bait in a
yeast 2-hybrid screen of a human kidney cDNA library, followed by RACE
of heart and HEK293 mRNA, Innamorati et al. (2002) cloned C1QTNF1, which
they called GIP. The deduced protein contains 379 amino acids. The
extracellular N terminus contains a TNF (see 191160) family
cysteine-rich region, followed by a transmembrane domain, a C-terminal
collagen-like sequence of 14 Gly-X-Y repeats, and a globular domain.
Northern blot analysis detected prominent expression in heart and lower
expression in placenta, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, prostate and
ovary. Little to no expression was detected in other tissues examined.
In transfected HEK293 and COS cells, epitope-tagged GIP was expressed in
vesicular structures surrounding the nucleus and near the cell surface.
Western blot analysis detected epitope-tagged GIP at about 40 kD and 130
kD, suggesting GIP can form trimers.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a yeast 2-hybrid assay and pull-down experiments, Innamorati et
al. (2002) confirmed the interaction between the second intracellular
loop of V2R and the C-terminal portion of GIP.

GENE STRUCTURE

Innamorati et al. (2002) determined that the C1QTNF1 gene contains 3
coding exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Innamorati et al. (2002) mapped the
C1QTNF1 gene to chromosome 17q25.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The vacuolar proton-ATPase (V-ATPase) is composed of an extramembrane
catalytic sector and a transmembrane proton-conducting sector. See
603717. Ludwig et al. (1998) identified 2 novel proteins, 8 to 9 and 9.2
kD in size, in the membrane sector of bovine chromaffin granule
V-ATPase. They designated the larger protein M9.2 and the smaller
protein M8-9 (ATP6AP2; 300556). By searching an EST database with the
N-terminal sequence of bovine M9.2, Ludwig et al. (1998) identified
homologous cDNAs from human and mouse. The deduced 80-amino acid human
M9.2 protein is extremely hydrophobic with 2 predicted membrane-spanning
helices. Human and mouse M9.2 differed at only 1 amino acid position.
Northern blot analysis revealed that M9.2 was present in all bovine
tissues tested. Nanji et al. (2001) cloned canine ATP6H, which was found
to encode a predicted protein with 99% amino acid sequence identity to
the orthologous human protein.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the ATP6H
gene to chromosome 5 (TMAP sts-H56007).

ANIMAL MODEL

Copper toxicosis resulting in liver disease occurs commonly in
Bedlington terriers. Because the ATP6H gene is associated with copper
and iron transport in yeast, Nanji et al. (2001) screened for mutations
in the canine ATP6H gene but found no mutations in affected dogs.
Mapping of the ATP6H gene and a marker closely linked to the copper
toxicosis locus on a canine radiation hybrid panel indicated lack of
close physical association.

604051	TITLE *604051 ENDO/EXONUCLEASE, ENDOG-LIKE; EXOG
;;ENDONUCLEASE G-LIKE 1; ENDOGL1;;
ENGL
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

EXOG is an endonuclease G (ENDOG; 600440)-like mitochondrial
endo/exonuclease that has both endonuclease and 5-prime-to-3-prime
exonuclease activities (Cymerman et al., 2008).

CLONING

By analysis of a 515-kb cloned segment from 3p22-p21.3, a region that is
commonly deleted in various carcinomas, Daigo et al. (1999) identified
10 genes, 4 of which were novel. They designated one of the novel genes
ENGL (endonuclease G-like) because the predicted 368-amino acid ENGL
protein shares 38% identity with endonuclease G (ENDOG; 600440).
Northern blot analysis revealed that ENGL was expressed as a 1.7-kb mRNA
in all tissues tested. An additional 2.1-kb mRNA, designated ENGLb, was
detected in heart, liver, skeletal muscle, and testis. The ENGLb
transcript contained all or part of 4 of the 6 ENGL exons, as well as a
3-prime exon not present in the genomic clone analyzed.

Cymerman et al. (2008) reported that the 368-amino acid EXOG protein has
a calculated molecular mass of 41.1 kD. It contains an N-terminal
mitochondrial leader sequence (MLS), a central catalytic ser-arg-gly-his
(SRGH) motif, and a C-terminal coiled-coil domain. A predicted helical
transmembrane segment is located within the MLS. Confocal
immunohistochemical analysis revealed that EXOG localized to
mitochondria in HeLa cells. Mitochondrial subfractionation, immunogold
electron microscopy, and confocal laser scanning microscopy showed that
EXOG localized specifically to the inner mitochondrial membrane.

GENE FUNCTION

By assaying transfected HEK293 cells, Cymerman et al. (2008) showed that
EXOG had high endonuclease activity against circular single-stranded
DNA. Recombinant EXOG lacking the N-terminal MLS showed a similar
preference for circular single-stranded DNA, but it also cleaved
super-coiled and open circular DNA after prolonged incubation. EXOG
showed 5-prime-to-3-prime exonuclease activity toward single- and
double-stranded DNA and single-stranded RNA. It showed little to no
endonuclease activity on ribosomal RNA substrates. Mutation of the
conserved his140 within the SRGH catalytic motif or removal of the
C-terminal coiled-coil domain abolished EXOG activity. Cymerman et al.
(2008) also found that a naturally occurring SNP resulting in a
gly277-to-val (G277V) substitution inactivated EXOG. Mutation analysis
showed that the transmembrane segment within the N-terminal MLS of EXOG
was required for EXOG mitochondrial localization.

GENE STRUCTURE

Daigo et al. (1999) determined that the EXOG gene contains 6 exons.
Cymerman et al. (2008) found that it spans 28.35 kb.

MAPPING

Daigo et al. (1999) identified the EXOG gene within a 515-kb cloned
segment from 3p22-p21.3. EXOG was the most telomeric gene in the cloned
region and was located next to the ActRIIB (ACVR2B; 602730) gene.
Cymerman et al. (2008) stated that the EXOG gene maps to chromosome
3p21.3.

606043	TITLE *606043 ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 331; ZNF331
;;ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 463; ZNF463;;
REARRANGED IN THYROID ADENOMAS; RITA
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Zinc finger proteins have been shown to interact with nucleic acids and
to have diverse functions. The zinc finger domain is a conserved amino
acid sequence motif containing 2 specifically positioned cysteines and 2
histidines that are involved in coordinating zinc. Kruppel-related
proteins form one family of zinc finger proteins. See ZFP93 (604749) for
additional information on zinc finger proteins.

CLONING

Using a differential display/PCR method, Wu et al. (2001) identified a
novel Kruppel-related zinc finger gene, which they designated ZNF463,
encoding a 463-amino acid protein with an N-terminal KRAB domain and 12
C-terminal C2H2 zinc finger units. Northern blot analysis revealed
testis-restricted expression of a 1.9-kb ZNF463 transcript. RT-PCR
analysis demonstrated higher expression of ZNF463 in normal fertile
adults than in fetuses or patients with azoospermia, suggesting that
ZNF463 may play a role in spermatogenesis.

MAPPING

By FISH, Wu et al. (2001) mapped the ZNF463 gene to chromosome
19q13.3-q13.4. This localization is consistent with the finding of the
ZNF331 gene in the region of 19q13 breakpoints involved in follicular
adenomas of the thyroid gland (Rippe et al., 1999).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Translocations involving 19q13 are a frequent finding in follicular
adenomas of the thyroid and may represent the most frequent type of
structural aberration in human epithelial tumors (Belge et al., 1998).
By positional cloning of the 19q13 breakpoints found in follicular
adenomas of the thyroid gland, Rippe et al. (1999) identified a
candidate gene that they initially referred to as RITA (rearranged in
thyroid adenomas) and renamed ZNF331. Meiboom et al. (2003) reported
unique expression of a 3.4-kb ZNF331 transcript in thyroid adenoma cell
lines with 19q13 aberrations which was not detected either in normal
tissues or in thyroid carcinoma cell lines.

610304	TITLE *610304 DER1-LIKE DOMAIN FAMILY, MEMBER 2; DERL2
;;F-LANa;;
DERLIN 2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Proteins that are unfolded or misfolded in the endoplasmic reticulum
(ER) must be refolded or degraded to maintain the homeostasis of the ER.
DERL2 is involved in the degradation of misfolded glycoproteins in the
ER (Oda et al., 2006).

CLONING

By differential display to identify genes upregulated in human
hepatocellular carcinomas, followed by screening a liver cDNA library,
Ying et al. (2001) cloned DERL2, which they called F-LANa. The deduced
protein contains 239 amino acids. Northern blot analysis of normal liver
detected a primary transcript of about 1.2 kb and a minor transcript of
about 4.9 kb. F-LANa was variably expressed in mouse heart, liver,
spleen, lung, kidney, brain and stomach but not skeletal muscle. By
virtue of their similarity to DERL1 (608813), Lilley and Ploegh (2004)
identified DERL2 and DERL3 (610305), which are 70% identical to each
other.

By microarray analysis to identify ER stress-inducible genes in HeLa
cells, Oda et al. (2006) cloned DERL2 and identified short and long
variants. Northern blot analysis detected ubiquitous DERL2 expression.
DERL2 appeared to be a 4-transmembrane protein with its N and C termini
facing the cytosol.

GENE FUNCTION

Ying et al. (2001) found that F-LANa was upregulated in 10 of 14
hepatocellular carcinomas and in the 3 carcinoma cell lines examined.
Oda et al. (2006) found that Derl2 mRNA was induced in response to ER
stress in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Induction of Derl2 was greatly
attenuated in cells lacking Ire1-alpha (ERN1; 604033) or Xbp1 (194355).
Immunofluorescence analysis of HeLa cells revealed that DERL2 and DERL3
colocalized with SEC61B (609214), a component of the ER translocon.
Overexpression of DERL2 or DERL3 accelerated the degradation of NHK, a
misfolded glycoprotein substrate (107400.0024), and reducing DERL2 and
DERL3 expression with short hairpin RNAs reduced the degradation of NHK.
Both DERLs were able to bind nonglycosylated NHK, but this substrate was
not degraded. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis indicated both DERLs
interacted with p97 (VCP; 601023) and EDEM1 (607673), components of the
ER-associated protein degradation machinery. DERL2 and DERL3 also
interacted with each other. Oda et al. (2006) concluded that DERL2 and
DERL3 are regulated by the unfolded protein response and are required
for ER-associated degradation of misfolded glycoproteins.

Using human cell lines, Mueller et al. (2008) identified several
components of a protein complex required for retrotranslocation or
dislocation of misfolded proteins from the ER lumen to the cytosol for
proteasome-dependent degradation. These included SEL1L (602329), HRD1
(SYVN1; 608046), derlin-2, the ATPase p97, PDI (P4HB; 176790), BIP
(HSPA5; 138120), calnexin (CANX; 114217), AUP1 (602434), UBXD8 (FAF2),
UBC6E (UBE2J1), and OS9 (609677).

GENE STRUCTURE

Ying et al. (2001) determined that the DERL2 gene contains 7 exons and
spans at least 11.8 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Ying et al. (2001) mapped the DERL2 gene
to chromosome 17p.

ANIMAL MODEL

Dougan et al. (2011) found that Derl2 -/- mice were born at the expected
mendelian ratio, but that the majority died within 24 hour due to
failure to feed. Surviving Derl2 -/- mice appeared healthy, but they
were smaller than wildtype and showed reproductive defects, with
sterility in Derl2 -/- males and late-stage abortions in pregnant Derl2
-/- females. Derl2 -/- mice also developed involution of the rib cage
between 2 and 4 months of age, which became progressively worse and
terminated in a wasting disease by 12 months of age. No rib
abnormalities were detected in fetal or perinatal Derl2 -/- mice.
Histologic evaluation of adult Derl2 -/- ribs showed a defect in
cartilage structure with abnormal chondrocytes containing cytoplasmic
inclusions. Unlike wildtype mouse chondrocytes, Derl2 -/- chondrocytes
did not survive in culture, and they showed upregulation of the collagen
matrix protein Comp (600310), retention of Comp in the ER, and death by
apoptosis. Embryonic fibroblasts cultured from Derl2 -/- mice showed
strong induction of components of the unfolded protein response. Derl2
deletion targeted to B cells or liver was consistent with survival,
although affected tissues showed upregulation of the unfolded protein
response. Derl2 deletion also led to upregulation of all members of the
Derlin complex in all mutant tissues and cells examined, with the
exception of Derl1, which was downregulated. Dougan et al. (2011)
concluded that DERL2 is required for normal secretion of collagen matrix
proteins from chondrocytes and for stabilization of DERL1.

cDNAs, which they designated DAZAP1 (607430) and DAZAP2, encoding
proteins of 407 and 167 amino acids, respectively. Northern blot
analysis detected ubiquitous, low-level expression of a 2.2-kb DAZAP2
transcript.

GENE FUNCTION

Using GST-fusion binding analysis, Tsui et al. (2000) determined that
both DAZAP1 and DAZAP2 interact with DAZ and DAZL (601486). Deletion
constructs indicated that DAZ and DAZL bind to DAZAP1/DAZAP2 mainly
through the DAZ repeat region.

MAPPING

By FISH, Tsui et al. (2000) mapped the DAZAP2 gene to chromosome
2q33-q34.

;;HTRA, E. COLI, HOMOLOG OF, 3;;
PREGNANCY-RELATED SERINE PROTEASE, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF; PRSP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By screening a heart cDNA library with mouse Prsp, Nie et al. (2003)
isolated 2 nearly identical variants encoding isoforms of the human Prsp
homolog, which they called HTRA3. The long isoform, HTRA3L, contains 453
amino acids and has a predicted molecular mass of 49 kD. It contains an
N-terminal signal peptide, followed by an insulin/IGF (see
147440)-binding domain, a Kazal-type S protease inhibitor domain, a
trypsin protease domain, and a PDZ domain. The short isoform, HTRA3S,
contains 357 amino acids and has a predicted molecular mass of 38 kD.
HTRA3S is truncated at the C terminus relative to HTRA3L and contains 7
unique C-terminal residues; it lacks the PDZ domain. HTRA3L and HTRA3S
have domain structures similar to that of HTRA1 (PRSS11; 602194), and
they share 61% and 66% amino acid identity with HTRA1, respectively.
Both HTRA3 isoforms contain active site sequence motifs characteristic
of the HTRA serine protease family. Northern blot analysis detected
strong expression of 2.8- and 2.2-kb HTRA3 transcripts in heart,
placenta, skeletal muscle, and kidney. Weaker expression of the 2.2-kb
transcript was detected in brain, and weaker expression of the 2.8-kb
transcript was detected in lung and small intestine. Screening of a
human RNA dot blot with a probe from mouse Prsp showed widespread
expression, with highest levels in fetal and adult heart, as well as in
some reproductive organs, including ovary, uterus, and placenta.

GENE STRUCTURE

Nie et al. (2003) determined that the HTRA3 gene contains at least 10
exons. The HTRA3S isoform is encoded by exons 1 through 7, while the
HTRA3L isoform is encoded by exons 1 through 6 plus exons 8 through 10.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Nie et al. (2003) mapped the HTRA3 gene to
chromosome 4p16.1.

605609	TITLE *605609 OXIDATION RESISTANCE 1; OXR1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

In a search for human genes that function in protection against
oxidative damage, Volkert et al. (2000) identified the human OXR1
(oxidation resistance-1) gene. The method used to identify the gene
involved transforming E. coli oxidation repair-defective spontaneous
mutator strains with a human cDNA library and screening transformants
for a reduction in mutator activity. OXR1 is a member of a conserved
family of genes found in eukaryotes but not in prokaryotes.

GENE STRUCTURE

Volkert et al. (2000) determined that the OXR1 gene contains 9 exons.
The first exon includes 74 bp of upstream untranslated sequence present
in the cDNA, and the last exon includes 156 bp of downstream
untranslated DNA sequence.

MAPPING

Using data from the human genome sequencing effort, Volkert et al.
(2000) mapped the OXR1 gene to chromosome 8q23. A homologous sequence on
15q21 was thought to be a pseudogene because it lacked introns and
showed a frameshift mutation early in the OXR1 coding sequence that
disrupted the open reading frame.

605497	TITLE *605497 CARTILAGE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN; CRTAP
;;CASP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Castagnola et al. (1997) isolated a mouse Crtap cDNA from a subtracted
library specific for mRNAs highly expressed in hypertrophic chondrocytes
compared to proliferating and early differentiating chondrocytes. Using
a mouse Crtap clone to screen a human fetal brain cDNA library,
Tonachini et al. (1999) identified human CRTAP cDNA clones. Human CRTAP
encodes a deduced 401-amino acid protein with a putative signal peptide
of 26 amino acids. CRTAP contains 2 potential N-glycosylation signals.
CRTAP shares 89% amino acid sequence identity with mouse Crtap and 51%
identity with the chick homolog. The mouse and human genes contain a
C-terminal region of approximately 120 amino acids not present in the
chick protein.

Using Northern blot analysis of human tissues, Tonachini et al. (1999)
detected 2-kb and 4-kb CRTAP transcripts in brain, heart, kidney, lung,
small intestine, and skeletal muscle. In all tissues except brain, the
2-kb transcript was more abundant. Using immunohistochemistry, the
authors detected CRTAP expression in articular chondrocytes. In mouse,
Morello et al. (1999) detected 3 Crtap transcripts in a range of
tissues, including all mouse embryonic cartilages. In chick, Castagnola
et al. (1997) detected a single Crtap transcript in a broad range of
embryonic tissues with the strongest expression in the developing
cartilage. They detected expression in the extracellular matrix of the
forming cartilage surrounding the notochord, the developing sclera, the
sphenoid and mandibular cartilage, the long bone cartilage, and the
developing sternal cartilage.

GENE FUNCTION

Using RNA in situ hybridization, Morello et al. (2006) showed that Crtap
is highly expressed in mouse growth plate proliferating chondrocytes and
in cells at the chondroosseous junction. At embryonic day 15.5, it is
expressed strongly in the presumptive bone collar of the diaphyses,
where vascular and osteoblast invasion is initiated. Its expression is
low in hypertrophic chondrocytes, and RT-PCR analysis confirmed
expression in both osteoclasts and osteoblasts. Most of the Crtap
protein is located within cells, although some signal was detected in
the extracellular matrix. Morello et al. (2006) also determined that
CRTAP forms a complex with prolyl 3-hydroxylase-1 (610339) and
cyclophilin-B (123841).

MAPPING

By FISH, Tonachini et al. (1999) mapped the human CRTAP gene to
chromosome 3p22. By the same method, Morello et al. (1999) mapped the
mouse homolog to a region showing homology of synteny on chromosome
9F3-F4.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In fibril-forming types I (see 120150) and II (see 120140) collagen,
prolyl 3-hydroxylation (P3H1/LEPRE1; 610339) occurs uniquely at
proline-986 in the triple-helical domain of the alpha-1 chain. Because
Crtap-null mice exhibit an osteochondrodysplasia with severe osteopenia
and lack prolyl 3-hydroxylation of fibrillar type I and II collagens,
Morello et al. (2006) investigated the CRTAP gene in cases of human
autosomal recessive osteogenesis imperfecta (OI). They found mutations
in patients with osteogenesis imperfecta type VII (610682).

Barnes et al. (2006) screened skin samples from 10 children with lethal
or severe osteogenesis imperfecta who had type I collagen with a normal
primary structure and identified CRTAP mutations in 3 of the infants who
had reduced levels of CRTAP expression. Barnes et al. (2006) noted that
some patients with autosomal recessive lethal OI carried CRTAP mutations
that were partially functional, whereas others had null CRTAP mutations,
excess modification of type I collagen, and a condition that was lethal
in the first year of life.

Chang et al. (2010) investigated the interaction of complex components
in fibroblasts from osteogenesis imperfecta types VII and VIII (610915)
patients. Both CRTAP and P3H1 were absent or reduced on Western blots
and by immunofluorescence microscopy in cells containing null mutations
in either gene. Levels of P3H1 or CRTAP transcripts, however, were
normal in CRTAP- or LEPRE1-null cells, respectively. Stable transfection
of a CRTAP or P3H1 expression construct into cells with null mutations
for the transfected cDNA restored both CRTAP and P3H1 protein levels.
Normalization of collagen helical modification in transfected CRTAP-null
cells demonstrated that the restored proteins functioned effectively as
a complex. Chang et al. (2010) concluded that CRTAP and P3H1 are
mutually stabilized in the collagen prolyl 3-hydroxylation complex,
which may provide an underlying mechanism for the overlapping phenotype
of types VII and VIII OI.

Valli et al. (2012) reported a 7-year-old Egyptian boy with nonlethal OI
type VII caused by a homozygous null mutation in the CRTAP gene
(605497.0007). The mutation resulted in reduction of CRTAP transcript
levels to approximately 10% of normal levels and undetectable CRTAP
protein in fibroblasts. The abnormal posttranslational modification of
the patient's type I collagen was typical for OI type VII, with
alpha-1(I)pro986 3-hydroxylation reduced to 5% of normal, and full
helical overmodification indicated by 40% hydroxylysine levels. By
immunofluorescence of long-term cultures, Valli et al. (2012) also
identified a severe deficiency (10-15% of control) of collagen deposited
in extracellular matrix, with disorganization of the minimal fibrillar
network. Quantitative pulse-chase experiments corroborated deficiency of
matrix deposition, rather than increased matrix turnover. Valli et al.
(2012) concluded that defects of extracellular matrix, as well as
intracellular defects in collagen modification, contribute to the
pathology of OI type VII.

ANIMAL MODEL

Morello et al. (2006) found that loss of Crtap in mice causes an
osteochondrodysplasia characterized by severe osteoporosis and decreased
osteoid production. CRTAP can form a complex with P3H1 (610339) and
cyclophilin B (CYPB; 123841), and Crtap -/- bone and cartilage collagens
showed decreased prolyl 3-hydroxylation. Moreover, mutant collagen
showed evidence of overmodification, and collagen fibrils in mutant skin
had increased diameter consistent with altered fibrillogenesis.

OSTEOGENESIS IMPERFECTA, TYPE VII
CRTAP, IVS1, -1021C-G

In genomic DNA from an affected member of a large consanguineous Quebec
family with osteogenesis imperfecta type VII (610682) described by Ward
et al. (2002), Morello et al. (2006) identified homozygosity for a
single-nucleotide change (-1021C-G) in intron 1 of the CRTAP gene
consistent with activation of a cryptic splice donor site and the
inclusion of a 73-bp cryptic exon (position -1094 to -1021 5-prime of
exon 2) into the CRTAP cDNA. This longer transcript contained a
frameshift and was predicted to become degraded by the nonsense-mediated
decay mechanism.

OSTEOGENESIS IMPERFECTA, TYPE VII
CRTAP, 1-BP DEL, 879T

In a consanguineous family in which 4 pregnancies were affected with
severe OI (610682), Morello et al. (2006) found a homozygous
single-basepair deletion in exon 4 (879delT) of the CRTAP gene in
affected individuals. This deletion caused a frameshift with a premature
termination codon 15 amino acids downstream and was expected to cause a
null allele due to nonsense-mediated decay. The parents were
asymptomatic but were carriers for the deletion. Biochemical and MS/MS
analysis of collagen from cultured fibroblasts from the proband
confirmed collagen overmodification and showed that the target proline
was underhydroxylated. CRTAP protein could not be identified in
fibroblasts from 1 affected individual. Real-time PCR performed on RNA
extracted from cultured fibroblasts showed that they contained 10% of
the amount seen in the OI type VII cells and about 1% of that seen in
control cells.

OSTEOGENESIS IMPERFECTA, TYPE VII
CRTAP, IVS1, G-C, +1

In a Pakistani infant with lethal osteogenesis imperfecta (610682),
Barnes et al. (2006) described a homozygous mutation in the splice donor
site of exon 1 of the CRTAP gene: IVS1+1G-C. Both parents, who were
second cousins, were heterozygous for the mutation. The boy was born at
35 weeks' gestation after an induced vaginal delivery. Prenatal
ultrasonography showed severe micromelia of the arms and legs. The eyes
showed proptosis and white sclerae. Radiographic survey revealed over 20
fractures of long bones and ribs. The child died at 10 months of age.

.0004
OSTEOGENESIS IMPERFECTA, TYPE VII
CRTAP, GLN276TER

In an infant daughter of nonconsanguineous black parents with
osteogenesis imperfecta type VII (610682), Barnes et al. (2006) found a
point mutation in the CRTAP gene that caused a gln276-to-stop (Q276X)
substitution in exon 4. The eyes showed proptosis and the sclerae were
white. The limbs were deformed, and radiographic survey showed fractures
of multiple bones. Cardiac catheterization on day 18 revealed absent
right pulmonary artery with a collateral vessel from the proximal
descending aorta supplying the trilobed right lung, hypoplastic
pulmonary veins, and systemic pulmonary hypertension. The girl died at
day 80 from respiratory insufficiency.

In affected members of a Saudi family with OI type VII, Shaheen et al.
(2012) identified a homozygous 826C-T transition in the CRTAP gene,
resulting in a Q276X mutation. The proband displayed severe prenatal
onset of fractures and died during the neonatal period.

.0005
OSTEOGENESIS IMPERFECTA, TYPE VII
CRTAP, MET1ILE

In an daughter of consanguineous parents of German descent, Barnes et
al. (2006) found that recessive lethal osteogenesis imperfecta (610682)
was related to compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the CRTAP
gene. From the father, she had inherited a point mutation in the CRTAP
start codon (AUG to AUA), causing a met1-to-ile substitution (M1I) that
was expected to eliminate the initiation of CRTAP translation. From her
mother, she inherited a 16-nucleotide duplication in exon 1, which
shifted the reading frame and resulted in a premature termination codon
in exon 2.

CRTAP gene (118_133del16insTACCC). The mutation shifts the CRTAP reading
frame, leading to a premature termination codon, 117 codons downstream
of the mutation in exon 2. The parents were heterozygous for the
mutation.

In affected members of a Saudi family with OI type VII (610682), Shaheen
et al. (2012) identified homozygosity for a 561T-G transversion in the
CRTAP gene, resulting in a tyr187-to-ter (Y187X) substitution. The
proband had severe neonatal onset of fractures, blue sclera, and
dentinogenesis imperfecta, with no hearing or other organ involvement.

603200	TITLE *603200 REGULATORY FACTOR X, ANKYRIN REPEAT-CONTAINING; RFXANK
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Major histocompatibility (MHC) class II molecules are transmembrane
proteins that have a central role in development and control of the
immune system. They are encoded by a multigene family and their
expression is tightly regulated. MHC class II deficiency (209920) is an
autosomal recessive immunodeficiency syndrome resulting from defects in
transacting factors essential for transcription of MHC class II genes.
There are 4 genetic complementation groups (A, B, C, and D), reflecting
the existence of 4 MHC class II regulators. The factor defective in
group A is CIITA, or MHC class II transactivator (MHCTA; 600005); in
group C, regulatory factor-5 (RFX5; 601863); and in group D, regulatory
factor X-associated protein (RFXAP; 601861). CIITA is a non-DNA-binding
coactivator that controls the cell type specificity and inducibility of
MHC class II expression. RFX5 and RFXAP are 2 subunits of RFX, a
multiprotein complex that binds the X box motif of MHC class II
promoters. Mutations in the genes encoding RFX5 or RFXAP abolish binding
of RFX to DNA. Similar to groups C and D, group B is characterized by a
defect in RFX binding, and although it accounts for the majority of
patients, the factor defective in group B remained unknown until
Masternak et al. (1998) isolated RFX by a novel single-step DNA-affinity
purification approach and identified RFXANK, the gene encoding the third
subunit of RFX. RFXANK restored MHC class II expression in cell lines
from patients in group B and was found to be mutated in these patients.
RFXANK contains a protein-protein interaction region consisting of 3
ankyrin repeats. Its interaction with RFX5 and RFXAP is essential for
binding of the RFX complex to MHC class II promoters. The gene was
symbolized RFXANK because the protein contains 3 ankyrin repeats.
Wiszniewski et al. (2000) stated that, since the first description of
combined immunodeficiency due to absence of MHC class II molecule
expression, about 70 patients from 50 families had been reported. Of the
4 complementation groups described, the largest had been group B. Most
of the patients in this category had been of North African origin.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Nekrep et al. (2000) demonstrated a direct interaction between the C
terminus of RFXAP and RFXANK; mutant RFXAP or RFXANK proteins failed to
bind. The authors found that RFX5 binds only to the RFXANK-RFXAP
scaffold and not to either protein alone. However, neither the scaffold
nor RFX5 alone can bind DNA. Nekrep et al. (2000) concluded that the
binding of the RFXANK-RFXAP scaffold to RFX5 leads to a conformational
change in the latter that exposes the DNA-binding domain of RFX5. The
DNA-binding domain of RFX5 anchors the RFX complex to the MHC class II X
and S promoter boxes. Another part of the RFX5 protein interacts with
MHC2TA. The authors pointed out that mutation of either protein in
complementation group B or group D of BLS patients prevents its binding
to the other protein, explaining why MHC class II promoters are bare in
the bare lymphocyte syndrome.

GENE STRUCTURE

Masternak et al. (1998) found that the RFXANK gene is composed of 10
exons spanning approximately 10 kb.

MAPPING

Masternak et al. (1998) reported that the RFXANK gene is located on
19p12 between MEF2B (600661) and CSPG3 (600826). This mapping was
accomplished by genomic DNA sequence information which referred them to
specific cosmids that were part of the Lawrence-Livermore chromosome 19
sequencing work.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Lennon-Dumenil et al. (2001) described a patient of North African origin
with the classic features of MHC class II deficiency. The patient had a
homozygous mutation affecting a splice donor site downstream of exon 4
of the RFXANK gene (603200.0003), resulting in a premature stop codon
and an inactive protein lacking all 3 ankyrin domains. Northern and
Western blot analyses of a cell line established from the patient
revealed a lack of expression of HLA-DPA (142880), HLA-DRB (142857),
HLA-DQB (604305), and HLA-DPB (142858), but near normal expression of
HLA-DRA (142860) and HLA-DQA (146880). The authors identified an
alternatively spliced RFXANK gene product that lacks exon 4, resulting
in a 28-amino acid deletion, and complementation and cytofluorometric
analyses confirmed that this alternative RFXANK cDNA could rescue
HLA-DRA and HLA-DRB expression.

Wiszniewski et al. (2003) stated that 7 different RFXANK mutations had
been reported in 26 unrelated patients with MHC class II deficiency.
They reported 2 novel mutations, including D121V (603200.0004),
resulting in loss of function of the gene.

In 2 unrelated patients with bare lymphocyte syndrome type II,
complementation group B (209920), Masternak et al. (1998) found a 26-bp
deletion of genomic DNA that removed the splice acceptor site and the
first nucleotide of exon 6 of the RFXANK gene. In 1 of these families,
reported by Lisowska-Grospierre et al. (1994), the parents were known to
be consanguineous. In both families, homozygosity was confirmed by
analysis of DNA from other family members.

Wiszniewski et al. (2000) performed a mutation analysis in 20 additional
patients belonging to complementation group B and detected the 26-bp
deletion beginning with 752G in 17 patients, all of North African
origin. A founder effect was documented, since all tested patients,
except 1, displayed a common haplotype spanning the RFXANK locus.

lack of expression of HLA-DPA (142880), HLA-DRB (142857), HLA-DQB
(604305), and HLA-DPB (142858), but near normal expression of HLA-DRA

Wiszniewski et al. (2003) identified an asp121-to-val (D121V) missense
mutation in the RFXANK gene. The D121V mutant was unable to form the RFX
complex, indicating that D121 is required for RFXAP binding.

608956	TITLE *608956 SOLUTE CARRIER FAMILY 46, MEMBER 2; SLC46A2
;;THYMIC STROMAL COTRANSPORTER; TSCOT
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Kim et al. (2000) cloned mouse thymic stromal cotransporter (Tscot),
which encodes a predicted 12-transmembrane (TM) domain protein of 479
amino acids. Tscot is developmentally regulated and is highly expressed
in fetal and adult thymic stromal cells.

Using Southern blot analysis, Chen et al. (2000) found Tscot homologs in
several mammalian species. They cloned a human TSCOT cDNA from a phage
library. The human and mouse proteins share 77% sequence identity, with
greatest conservation in the TM domains and in a cytoplasmic loop
between TMs 6 and 7. Northern blot analysis detected expression of an
approximately 2.4-kb human TSCOT transcript at high levels in adult
thymus and at lower levels in peripheral blood lymphocytes. Comparative
sequencing of the promoters of mouse and human TSCOT showed 6 highly
conserved regions containing potential binding sites for transcription
factors induced by interferon-alpha (see 147660) and for TFIIIA
(600860).

MAPPING

By interspecific backcross analysis, Chen et al. (2000) mapped the mouse
Tscot gene to chromosome 4 in a region that shows syntenic homology with
human 9q31-q34.

ANIMAL MODEL

Chen et al. (2000) created a transgenic mouse with GFP under control of
the murine Tscot promoter. The mice displayed strong GFP mRNA expression
in the thymus and weak expression in the kidney.

300002	TITLE *300002 ARYLSULFATASE D; ARSD
DESCRIPTION In the course of positional cloning of the gene mutant in X-linked
chondrodysplasia punctata (302950), Franco et al. (1995) identified a
cluster of 3 sulfatase genes located in the region Xp22.3. The genes
were arylsulfatases and were designated ARSD, ARSE (300180), and ARSF
(300003), in that order, proceeding from the telomere of Xp toward the
centromere. Mutations in ARSE were identified in males with
chondrodysplasia punctata. Franco et al. (1995) showed that both ARSD
and ARSE have 11 exons and are transcribed toward the telomere. Their
natural substrate was not determined.

Meroni et al. (1996) reported that ARSD and ARSE have several typical
features of genes that map in the pseudoautosomal region of the X
chromosome, i.e., they escape X inactivation, have homologs on the Y
chromosome, and are not conserved in mouse. Meroni et al. (1996) noted
that ARSD, ARSE, and STS have a conserved gene structure; alignment of
the genomic structures revealed perfect conservation of the intron-exon
junctions. Sequence analysis of the Y-linked homologs of ARSD and ARSE
indicated that they represent truncated pseudogenes.

604073	TITLE *604073 ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 131; ZNF131
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Transcriptional regulatory proteins containing tandemly repeated zinc
finger domains are thought to be involved in both normal and abnormal
cellular proliferation and differentiation. One abundant class of such
transcriptional regulators resembles the Drosophila Kruppel segmentation
gene product due to the presence of repeated cys2-his2 (C2H2) zinc
finger domains that are connected by conserved sequences, called H/C
links. By screening a human insulinoma cDNA library with a degenerate
oligonucleotide corresponding to the H/C linker sequence, Tommerup et
al. (1993) isolated cDNAs potentially encoding zinc finger proteins.
Tommerup and Vissing (1995) performed sequence analysis on a number of
these cDNAs and identified several novel zinc finger protein genes,
including ZNF131. The partial ZNF131 cDNA predicts a protein belonging
to the Kruppel family of zinc finger proteins.

By transfecting HEK293 cells with epitope-tagged protein, Oh and Chung
(2013) found that ZNF131 was expressed in a diffuse nuclear
distribution, with exclusion from nucleoli. They found that ZNF131 was
modified by ubiquitination and sumoylation.

GENE FUNCTION

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis of a human fetal brain cDNA library, Oh
and Chung (2013) found that ZNF131 interacted with UHRF2 (615211), a
dual-function ubiquitin and SUMO E3 ligase. Coimmunoprecipitation
analysis of transfected HEK293 cells confirmed the interaction. UHRF2
did not affect ZNF131 ubiquitination, but functioned as a SUMO E3 ligase
and sumoylated ZNF131 on lys567 in a dose-dependent manner. Both
sumoylation and ubiquitination of ZNF131 were enhanced in the presence
of a proteasome inhibitor.

MAPPING

By FISH, Tommerup and Vissing (1995) mapped the ZNF131 gene to
chromosome 5p12-p11.

612773	TITLE *612773 BASAL CELL ADHESION MOLECULE; BCAM
;;B-CELL ADHESION MOLECULE;;
CD239;;
MSK19
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The BCAM gene encodes a glycoprotein expressed on cell surfaces. It is a
member of the immunoglobulin superfamily of receptors and cell adhesion
molecules. When expressed on erythrocytes, BCAM constitutes the Lutheran
(Lu) and Auberger (Au) blood group antigens (111200) (Parsons et al.,
1997; Karamatic Crew et al., 2007).

CLONING

Parsons et al. (1995) isolated glycoproteins expressing the Lutheran
blood group antigens from human erythrocyte membranes and from human
fetal liver. They isolated cDNA clones corresponding to the protein from
a human placental lambda-gt11 library. The deduced 597-residue protein
was found to be a type I membrane protein with 5 potential
N-glycosylation sites. There were 5 disulfide-bonded, extracellular,
immunoglobulin superfamily domains (2 variable-region set and 3
constant-region set), a single hydrophobic, membrane-spanning domain,
and a cytoplasmic domain of 59 residues. The overall structure was
similar to that of the human tumor marker MUC18 (155735) and the chicken
neural adhesion molecule SC1. The extracellular domains and cytoplasmic
domain contained consensus motifs with a binding of integrin and SRC
homology 3 domains, respectively, suggesting possible receptor and
signal-transduction functions. Immunostaining of human tissues showed a
wide distribution and provided evidence that the glycoprotein is under
developmental control in liver, and may also be regulated during
differentiation in other tissues.

Rahuel et al. (1996) reported that 2 previously described cDNA clones,
the Lutheran cDNA clone described by Parsons et al. (1995) and the BCAM
cDNA clone described by Campbell et al. (1994), represented
alternatively spliced transcripts of the same gene on chromosome
19q13.2-q13.3. The structure and tissue distribution of these mRNA
spliceoforms were consistent with immunocharacterization of 2 active
glycoproteins, Lu and BCAM, in various cells. Rahuel et al. (1996) found
that the predominant isoform of the Lutheran glycoprotein in most normal
tissues is an 85-kD glycoprotein corresponding to the full-length BCAM
cDNA. However, the minor 78-kD spliceoform can also be identified in
erythrocyte membranes. The smaller isoform differs from the larger
Lutheran glycoprotein in that it lacks most of the cytoplasmic domain.

El Nemer et al. (1997) isolated the human LU gene by cloning a 20-kb
HindIII fragment from genomic DNA from an individual with Lu(a-b+).
Alternative splicing of intron 13 generated 2.5- and 4.0-kb transcript
spliceoforms encoding the long-tail and the short-tail Lu polypeptides,
respectively.

Parsons et al. (2001) cloned and characterized mouse Lu. The human and
mouse proteins share 72% sequence identity and both bind laminin-10/11
with high affinity.

GENE STRUCTURE

Parsons et al. (1997) determined that the BCAM gene contains 15 exons
and spans approximately 11 kb. El Nemer et al. (1997) reported that the
BCAM gene contains 15 exons distributed over 12.5 kb.

MAPPING

The Lutheran blood group antigen was the first autosomal linkage
demonstrated in man, by Dr. Jan Mohr (1951) in Copenhagen, using
Penrose's sib-pair method. Lutheran and Secretor (Se; see FUT2, 182100)
were known to be linked (review by Cook, 1965). FUT2 has since been
mapped to chromosome 19q.

Gedde-Dahl et al. (1984) found linkage of Se and APOE (107741), which is
on 19q13. A peak lod score of 3.3 was obtained at recombination fraction
0.08 in males and 1.36 at 0.22 in females. Linkage of APOE and Lu
yielded a lod score 4.52 in sexes combined. C3 (120700)-APOE linkage
gave a lod score of 4.0 at theta 0.18 in males but 0.04 at theta 0.45 in
females. Triple heterozygote families confirmed that APOE is on the Se
side and on the Lu side of C3. A summarizing map was given (their Figure
3).

Lewis et al. (1988) demonstrated that APOC2 (608083), Lu, and Se
constitute a tightly linked gene cluster and concluded that Lu and Se
are on chromosome 19q.

Parsons et al. (2001) mapped the mouse Lu gene to a region on chromosome
7 showing conserved synteny with human chromosome 19q13.2.

- Auberger System

Whitehouse et al. (1988) showed that the Au blood group is genetically
independent from the locus for the Kell blood group (KEL; 110900) and
the loci for C3, C6, Gc, HLA, PI, and Gm groups.

Evidence that the Auberger antigens are in the Lutheran system came from
the fact that they are located on the glycoproteins that carry Lutheran
determinants and that they show the same linkage relationships to
markers on chromosome 19 (Zelinski et al., 1990).

GENE FUNCTION

Although the Au(a) antigen was found by Salmon et al. (1961), the
antithetical antigen, Au(b), was not found until 1989 (Frandson et al.,
1989). Daniels et al. (1991) showed that the Au(a) and Au(b) antigens
belong to the Lutheran system.

Rahuel et al. (1996) noted that the BCAM antigen was first identified by
monoclonal antibodies raised against human tumor cells and was shown to
be overexpressed in ovarian carcinomas in vivo and upregulated following
malignant transformation in certain cell types.

El Nemer et al. (1997) showed that CHO cells expressing recombinant
short-tail or long-tail Lu glycoproteins reacted as well with anti-Lu as
with anti-BCAM antibodies, providing definitive proof that the Lu blood
group and BCAM antigens are carried by the same molecules.

Lutheran blood group glycoproteins are receptors for the extracellular
matrix protein laminin. Studies suggest that these glycoproteins may
contribute to vasoocclusion in sickle cell disease (603903), and sickle
cells can be shown to adhere to laminin isoforms containing the alpha-5
chain (laminin-10/11). Laminin alpha-5 (LAMA5; 601033) is present in the
subendothelium and is also a constituent of bone marrow sinusoids,
suggesting a role for the Lu/laminin interaction in erythropoiesis
(Parsons et al., 2001).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Data on gene frequencies of allelic variants were tabulated by
Roychoudhury and Nei (1988).

- Lutheran System

El Nemer et al. (1997) found that BCAM coding sequences amplified from
the genomic DNA of Lu (a+b-) or Lu (a-b+) blood donors showed a single
G-to-A transition in the gene (H77R; 612773.0001). When expressed in
Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, Lu cDNAs carrying 229A or 229G
produced cell surface proteins that reacted with anti-Lu(a) or
anti-Lu(b) antibodies, respectively, showing that these nucleotides
specified the 2 major alleles of the Lutheran blood group locus.

Parsons et al. (1997) also demonstrated that the Lu(a)/Lu(b) variant is
determined by an H77R variant in the BCAM1 gene, resulting in a
substitution in immunoglobulin domain 1.

- Auberger System

Parsons et al. (1997) demonstrated that the Au(a)/Au(b) polymorphism
resulted from a variation in the G strand of domain 5 of the BCAM gene
(T539A; 612773.0002)

- Autosomal Recessive Lutheran Null Blood Group Phenotype

In 3 unrelated patients with the autosomal recessive Lutheran null blood
group phenotype (247420), Karamatic Crew et al. (2007) identified
compound heterozygous or homozygous mutations in the BCAM gene
(612773.0003-612773.0006). None of the patients had obvious clinical
manifestations and were identified through routine serology as having
serum anti-LU3 antibodies. All mutations were truncating and affected
the extracellular domain of the Lu glycoprotein, suggesting that none of
the mutant proteins would be integrated into the cell membrane.

NOMENCLATURE

Lutheran is a complex blood group system consisting of 19 antigens
numbered from LU1 to LU21, with 2 numbers (LU10 and LU15) declared
obsolete. Four pairs of these antigens have allelic relationships:
LU1/LU2, also known as Lu(a)/(b); LU6 and LU9; LU8 and LU14; and
LU18/LU19, also known as Au(a)/(b) (Karamatic Crew et al., 2007).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
LUTHERAN BLOOD GROUP POLYMORPHISM Lu(a)/Lu(b)
BCAM, HIS77ARG

Parsons et al. (1997) demonstrated that the Lu(a)/(b) polymorphism
(111200) results from a 252G-A transition in exon 3 of the BCAM gene,
resulting in a his77-to-arg (H77R) substitution in immunoglobulin
domain-1. The Lutheran glycoprotein of Lu(b) immunospecificity has
arginine at position 77.

El Nemer et al. (1997) reported the Lu(a)/Lu(b) polymorphism as a 229A-G
nucleotide change, resulting in a H77R substitution for the Lu(b)
allele. When expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, Lu cDNAs
carrying 229A or 229G produced cell surface proteins that reacted with
anti-Lu(a) or anti-Lu(b) antibodies, respectively, showing that these
nucleotides specified the 2 major alleles of the Lutheran blood group
locus.

Karamatic Crew et al. (2007) noted that Lu(a)/(b) is also referred to as
Lu(1)/(2).

.0002
AUBERGER BLOOD GROUP POLYMORPHISM Au(a)/Au(b)
BCAM, THR539ALA

Parsons et al. (1997) demonstrated that the Au(a)/(b) polymorphism (see
111200) of the Lutheran glycoprotein results from a 1637A-G transition
in the BCAM gene, resulting in a thr539-to-ala (T539A) substitution on
the G strand of domain 5.

Karamatic Crew et al. (2007) noted that Au(a)/(b) is also referred to as
Lu(18)/(19).

.0003
BLOOD GROUP--LUTHERAN NULL
BCAM, ARG231TER

In an English woman with the Lutheran null blood group phenotype
(247420), Karamatic Crew et al. (2007) identified compound
heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the BCAM gene: a 691C-T transition in
exon 6 resulting in an arg231-to-ter (R231X) substitution in the
extracellular second immunoglobulin domain, and a deletion of exons 3
and 4 (612773.0004). The woman had previously been reported by
Darnborough et al. (1963). There were no clinical manifestations; she
was identified through routine serology in preparation for surgery.

BLOOD GROUP--LUTHERAN NULL
BCAM, DEL EX3-4

See 612773.0003 and Karamatic Crew et al. (2007).

.0005
BLOOD GROUP--LUTHERAN NULL
BCAM, CYS237TER

In a healthy Japanese man with the Lutheran null blood group phenotype
(247420), Mallinson et al. (1997) identified a homozygous 733C-A
transversion in exon 6 of the BCAM gene, resulting in a cys237-to-ter
(C237X) substitution in the extracellular domain. He was identified
through blood donation and had no phenotypic manifestations. His parents
and brother were heterozygous for the mutation. Karamatic Crew et al.
(2007) stated that the C237X substitution resulted from a 711C-A
transversion based on numbering from the translation initiation ATG
codon.

.0006
BLOOD GROUP--LUTHERAN NULL
BCAM, ARG121TER

In a German Caucasian woman with the Lutheran null blood group phenotype
(247420), Karamatic Crew et al. (2004) identified a homozygous 361C-T
transition in exon 3 of the BCAM gene, resulting in an arg121-to-ter
(R121X) substitution in the extracellular first immunoglobulin domain.
She was identified in a surgical work-up.

;;GAP JUNCTION PROTEIN, ALPHA-11; GJA11;;
GAP JUNCTION PROTEIN, 31.9-KD;;
CONNEXIN 31.9; CX31.9;;
GAP JUNCTION PROTEIN, CHI-1, FORMERLY; GJC1, FORMERLY
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CX31.9 is a member of the large family of connexins that are required
for the formation of gap junctions. Six connexin monomers form a
hemichannel, or connexon, on the cell surface. This connexon can
interact with a connexon from a neighboring cell, thus forming a channel
linking the cytoplasm of the 2 cells.

CLONING

Nielsen et al. (2002) identified an EST containing CX31.9, which they
also referred to as gap junction protein alpha-11 (GJA11), by homology
with other connexin sequences. They cloned the full-length cDNA by
5-prime and 3-prime RACE of a testis cDNA library. The deduced 294-amino
acid protein contains 4 transmembrane domains and shows conserved
spacing of cysteine residues in the 2 extracellular domains. The
C-terminal region contains 4 potential protein kinase C (see 176960)
phosphorylation sites and a casein kinase II (see 115440)
phosphorylation site. The amino acid identity between CX31.9 and other
connexins ranges from 32 to 41%. Connexins most similar to CX31.9 are
members of the alpha group of connexins. Northern blot analysis revealed
a 4.4-kb transcript in all tissues examined, although with varying
intensities. The intensities of minor transcripts of 1, 0.5, and 0.4 kb
correlated with the intensity of the 4.4-kb transcript. Western blot
analysis revealed a protein of 30 to 33 kD in heart, colon, and artery,
but not in brain and skeletal muscle. Immunohistologic analysis of
tissue sections revealed immunoreactivity localized to vascular smooth
muscle cells of testis, brain, and tonsil. Fluorescence-tagged CX31.9
expressed in HEK cells localized to gap junction-like structures and to
intracellular puncta that partly colocalized with ZO1 (TJP1; 601009).

GENE FUNCTION

By immunoprecipitation of transfected HEK cells and by in vitro
pull-down assays, Nielsen et al. (2002) determined that CX31.9 directly
interacts with ZO1. Mutation analysis and stearic hindrance from the
addition of a large fluorescent tag suggested that the C-terminal
residues of CX31.9 interact with the second PDZ domain of ZO1. Nielsen
et al. (2002) determined that CX31.9 channels expressed in paired
Xenopus oocytes conferred significant cell-to-cell conductances that
increased with the concentration of injected CX31.9 cRNA. The gap
junctions showed very little voltage sensitivity.

White et al. (2002) confirmed the lack of voltage gating by CX31.9
expressed in paired Xenopus oocytes and in transfected mouse
neuroblastoma cells. They found that, like other connexins, CX31.9
junctions are gated by cytoplasmic acidification or exposure to
halothane.

Bukauskas et al. (2006) found that CX31.9 and its mouse ortholog,
Cx30.2, formed functional channels that were permeable to cationic dyes
up to about 400 kD. Cells expressing CX31.9 or Cx30.2 exhibited much
faster dye uptake than cells expressing other connexins, and the rate of
uptake increased at low exterior calcium concentration and was decreased
by hemichannel blockers. Mouse Cx30.2 hemichannels also showed weak
voltage sensitivity. Unitary conductance of fully open mouse Cx30.2
hemichannels was about 20 pS, approximately double that of cell-cell
channels.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Nielsen et al. (2002) mapped the GJC1 gene
to chromosome 17q21.1.

ANIMAL MODEL

Kreuzberg et al. (2006) generated mice that were conditionally null for
Cx30.2, the mouse homolog of human CX31.9. The mice exhibited a PQ
interval that was about 25% shorter than that of wildtype littermates,
due to significantly accelerated conduction above the His bundle. Atrial
stimulation revealed an elevated AV-nodal conduction capacity and faster
ventricular response rates during induced episodes of atrial
fibrillation in mutant mice. Kreuzberg et al. (2006) concluded that
Cx30.2 contributes to the slowdown of impulse propagation in the AV node
and additionally limits the maximum number of beats conducted from atria
to ventricles.

612339	TITLE *612339 GAMMA-GLUTAMYLTRANSFERASE, LIGHT CHAIN 2; GGTLC2
;;GGT, TYPE III;;
GGTL4
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Gamma-glutamyltransferase-1 (GGT1; 612346) is a membrane-bound
extracellular enzyme that cleaves gamma-glutamyl peptide bonds in
glutathione and other peptides and transfers the gamma-glutamyl moiety
to acceptors. Autocatalytic cleavage of the GGT1 precursor polypeptide
produces a heavy chain and a light chain that associate with each other
to form the functional enzyme. Light chain-only GGTs, such as GGTLC2,
contain a region corresponding to the GGT1 light chain, but they lack
the membrane-anchoring heavy chain region (Heisterkamp et al., 2008).

CLONING

Courtay et al. (1994) obtained partial genomic sequences of several GGT
genes and pseudogenes, including GGTLC2, which they designated clone 1.
Compared with other GGTs, GGTLC2 has a mutation at the splice donor of
an 81-bp intron, resulting in an unspliced intron. RT-PCR detected
GGTLC2 expression in sigmoid colon and placenta, with weaker expression
in lung and thyroid, but not in other tissues examined.

By 5-prime and 3-prime RACE of placenta cDNA, Leh et al. (1996) cloned
GGTLC2, which they designated GGT type III. The deduced 260-amino acid
protein lacks the large GGT subunit, but it retains the small GGT
subunit. Compared with other GGTs, GGTLC2 has a 27-amino acid insertion
due to the unspliced 81-bp intron. RT-PCR detected GGTLC2 in lymphocytes
from nearly half of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, but not
in lymphocytes from healthy subjects nor in any hematopoietic cell line
examined.

Heisterkamp et al. (2008) noted that the glutamate-binding site of GGT1
includes 8 residues in its light chain and 1 residue (arg107) in its
heavy chain. They determined that GGTLC2 contains residues corresponding
to the 8 glutamate-binding residues in the GGT1 light chain, but it
lacks a residue equivalent to arg107 in the GGT1 heavy chain. EST
database analysis suggested that GGTLC2 expression is restricted to
testis and germ cell tumors.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Heisterkamp et al. (2008) mapped the
GGTLC2 gene to chromosome 22q11.2.

607403	TITLE *607403 INTERFERON, LAMBDA-1; IFNL1
;;INTERLEUKIN 29; IL29
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

IL29, or IFNL1, belongs to the interferon-lambda family (also known as
type III interferons), whose members are distantly related to both type
I interferons (e.g., IFNA2; 147562) and members of the IL10 (124092)
family. IL29 has significant antiviral activity and immunoregulatory
properties and appears to inhibit T helper-2 (Th2) responses (Srinivas
et al., 2008).

CLONING

By genomic sequence analysis, Sheppard et al. (2003) identified genes
encoding IL28A (607401), IL28B (607402), and IL29. The deduced 200-amino
acid IL29 protein is 81% identical to IL28A and IL28B, but it shares
only low homology with IL10 (124092), IFNA2, and IL22 (605330). IL29 has
a conserved cysteine pattern and amphipathic profile similar to other
helical cytokine family members.

GENE FUNCTION

By RT-PCR analysis, Sheppard et al. (2003) determined that treatment of
mononuclear cells and other cell types with double-stranded RNA or viral
infection induced transcription of IL28 and IL29. Addition of IL28,
IL29, or IFNA2 also induced protection from virus challenge infection,
but IL28 and IL29 did not display antiproliferative activity. Luciferase
reporter analysis indicated that IL28 and IL29 signal through
IFN-stimulated response elements. However, IL28 and IL29 did not bind to
IFNAR1 (107450), but instead bound to and signaled through a novel
receptor, IL28RA (607404) partnered with IL10RB (123889). Sheppard et
al. (2003) proposed that IL28 and IL29 represent an evolutionary link
between type I IFNs and the IL10 family and may serve as an alternative
therapeutic choice to type I IFNs.

Using quantitative RT-PCR, ELISA, and intracellular FACS analysis of
mitogen-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells, Srinivas et al.
(2008) showed that IFNL1 preferentially inhibited IL13 (147683) compared
with IL4 (147780) and IL5 (147850) Th2 cytokines, although significant
decreases of IL4 and IL5 were also detected. Srinivas et al. (2008)
concluded that IFNL1 is an inhibitor of Th2 cytokine responses,
primarily of IL13.

By screening human cells transfected with foreign DNA, Zhang et al.
(2011) observed expression of IFNL1, a type III IFN, rather than type I
IFN. Pull-down analysis with cytosolic proteins identified Ku70 (XRCC6;
152690) and Ku80 (XRCC5; 194364) as the DNA-binding proteins. Knockdown
and reporter analyses revealed that Ku70 functioned as a DNA sensor that
induced IFNL1 activation. Analysis of the IFNL1 promoter indicated that
positive-regulatory domain I and IFN-stimulated response element sites
were predominantly involved in DNA-mediated IFNL1 activation. Pull-down
assays showed that IFNL1 induction was associated with activation of
IRF1 (147575) and IRF7 (605047). Zhang et al. (2011) concluded that Ku70
mediates the induction of type III IFN by DNA, as may occur in viral
infections or DNA vaccination.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Sheppard et al. (2003) determined that the
IL29 gene contains 5 exons, in contrast to the related type I IFNs,
which are encoded by a single exon. Analysis of 5-prime regulatory
regions suggested the presence of DNA-binding elements involved in type
I IFN regulation.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Sheppard et al. (2003) mapped the IL28A,
IL28B, and IL29 genes to chromosome 19q13.13, a localization distinct
from that of the related type I IFNs, which are colocalized on
chromosome 9.
