611848	TITLE *611848 MITOCHONDRIAL RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN L43; MRPL43
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Mitochondria have their own translation system for production of 13
proteins essential for oxidative phosphorylation. MRPL43 is 1 of more
than 70 protein components of mitochondrial ribosomes that are encoded
by the nuclear genome (Kenmochi et al., 2001).

CLONING

By searching databases using bovine Mrpl43 as query, followed by PCR of
human genomic DNA, Kenmochi et al. (2001) cloned MRPL43.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis and analysis of an integrated BAC-STS map,
Kenmochi et al. (2001) mapped the MRPL43 gene to chromosome 10q24.

606818	TITLE *606818 DIPEPTIDYL PEPTIDASE III; DPP3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

DPP3 (EC 3.4.14.4) is one of the dipeptidyl aminopeptidases that remove
N-terminal dipeptides from physiologically active peptides such as
angiotensin (see 106150) or enkephalin (131330).

CLONING

Fukasawa et al. (1999) isolated a partial DPP3 cDNA clone from a
placenta cDNA library, using antibody to the purified protein as probe.
By mass spectrometry, Abramic et al. (2000) determined that the
molecular mass of full-length DPP3 is 82.5 kD; by SDS-PAGE, the apparent
molecular mass is 81.2 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

By mutation and enzyme analysis of the rat recombinant DPP3 protein,
Fukasawa et al. (1999) found that DPP3 shows zinc-dependent
metalloprotease activity and contains a conserved HELLGH motif with
similarity to the zincin HExxH consensus motif. Abramic et al. (2000)
noted that whereas the enzymes purified from rat and human erythrocytes
show the same molecular mass, pI, and enzyme substrates, they differ
significantly in their temperature stability, pH optima, kinetic
parameters, and sensitivity to divalent cations, sulfhydryl reagents,
and microbial protease inhibitors.

MAPPING

Fukasawa et al. (2000) mapped the DPP3 gene to chromosome 11q12-q13.1 by
FISH.

613741	TITLE *613741 GLYCOGEN PHOSPHORYLASE, LIVER; PYGL
;;LGP
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Phosphorylases (EC 2.4.1.1), such as PYGL, remove glycosyl units from
the terminal branches of glycogen through phosphorolysis, forming
glucose 1-phosphate. During stress, exercise, hypoxia, and hypoglycemia,
phosphorylase activity is primarily regulated by interconversion of the
active phosphorylated form and the inactive, nonphosphorylated form
(summary by Ercan-Fang et al., 2002).

CLONING

Newgard et al. (1986) reported the cDNA sequence encoding human liver
glycogen phosphorylase. The deduced protein contains 845 amino acids.

Burwinkel et al. (1998) reported corrections in the previously reported
PYGL coding sequence and polymorphisms in that sequence.

GENE STRUCTURE

Burwinkel et al. (1998) reported a partial PYGL gene structure showing
introns in the same positions as in PYGM (608455), which encodes the
muscle isoform of phosphorylase.

MAPPING

By the method of chromosome sorting and spot blotting, Newgard et al.
(1987) assigned the structural gene for hepatic phosphorylase to
chromosome 14. The gene in the mouse maps to chromosome 12 (Glaser et
al., 1989).

Gross (2011) mapped the PYGL gene to chromosome 14q22.1 based on an
alignment of the PYGL sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF046785) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

GENE FUNCTION

Using recombinant proteins expressed in insect cells, Ercan-Fang et al.
(2002) measured the effects of small molecular mass molecules on the
phosphorylase activities of the rat and human LGP active forms (LGPa).
When added individually at estimated physiologic concentrations, AMP
stimulated, whereas ADP, ATP, and glucose inhibited, both enzymes.
However, glucose inhibition was about 2-fold more potent with the human
enzyme. UDP-glucose, glucose 6-phosphate, and fructose 1-phosphate were
only minor inhibitors of both enzymes. When all effectors were present
in combination at estimated intracellular concentrations, the net effect
reduced human LGPa activity, but it had little effect on rat Lgpa
activity. This inhibition of human LGPa was glucose dependent.
Ercan-Fang et al. (2002) concluded that glucose may be a major regulator
of human LGPa activity, since glucose concentration changes greatly with
feeding and fasting.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 3 patients with glycogen storage disease VI (GSD6; 232700), also
known as Hers disease, Burwinkel et al. (1998) identified mutations in
the PYGL gene in homozygous or compound heterozygous state
(613741.0001-613741.0004).

By sequencing genomic DNA in a Mennonite family segregating glycogen
storage disease VI, Chang et al. (1998) identified a homozygous
abnormality of the intron 13 splice donor (613741.0005). This mutation
was estimated to be present on 3% of Mennonite chromosomes.

EVOLUTION

Newgard et al. (1986) compared the human liver phosphorylase cDNA
sequence with the previously determined rabbit muscle phosphorylase
sequence. Despite an amino acid identity of 80%, the 2 cDNAs exhibited a
remarkable divergence in G+C content. In the sequence for muscle
phosphorylase, 86% of the nucleotides at the third codon position are
either deoxyguanosine or deoxycytidine residues whereas in the liver
homolog the figure is only 60%. The liver phosphorylase cDNA appeared to
represent an evolutionary mosaic; the segment encoding the N-terminal 80
amino acids contained more than 90% G+C at the third codon position.
Newgard et al. (1986) proposed that the high G+C content in the
N-terminal region of the liver message indicates that this segment was
spliced onto the liver gene from the muscle gene long after the
divergence of liver and muscle tissues. This appears to be evidence for
exon shuffling as proposed by Gilbert (1978). Newgard et al. (1986)
considered it of interest, however, that organisms such as the
thermophilic bacteria and the protozoan Leischmania, which are exposed
to environmental stresses of high temperature and low pH, respectively,
have high G+C content in their coding sequences, presumably because the
greatest stability of G-C basepairs aids the processes of gene
replication, transcription, and, to a lesser extent, translation.
Possibly skeletal muscle, which undergoes a fall in pH and a rise in
temperature during exercise, represents a similarly stressful
environment that selectively maintains high G+C content in expressed
genes.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE VI
PYGL, IVS14DS, G-A, +1

In a 4.5-year-old boy with glycogen storage disease VI (232700), the son
of first-cousin Israeli-Arab Bedouin parents, Burwinkel et al. (1998)
described a splice site mutation. The patient presented at 2 years of
age with hepatomegaly and growth retardation, but had no clinical
history of fasting hypoglycemia. He was found to be homozygous for an
insertion of 119 nucleotides in codon R589, resulting in a frameshift
and introducing a stop codon after 5 missense codons. Sequencing showed
that the insert was an intron, presumably intron 14, but with a G-to-A
replacement in the GT consensus dinucleotide of the 5-prime splice site.
This splice site mutation thus led to the retention of intron 14 and 2
aberrant splice products employing neighboring GT dinucleotides in exon
14 and in intron 14, respectively, as illegitimate 5-prime splice sites.
Both parents were heterozygous for the mutation.

.0002
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE VI
PYGL, IVS4AS, G-C, -1

In a boy with glycogen storage disease VI (232700), the son of unrelated
and healthy parents of Suriname Hindustani background, Burwinkel et al.
(1998) identified a splice site mutation in the PYGL gene.. The patient
presented at age 2 years with hepatomegaly and severe growth
retardation. Transaminases were intermittently elevated. Marked glycogen
storage in hepatocytes was demonstrated. There was no known parental
consanguinity. The child was found to be heterozygous for a G-to-C
substitution in the AG consensus of the 3-prime splice site of intron 4
of the PYGL gene. Two missense mutations, val221 to ile (V221I) and
asn338 to ser (N338S), were found on the other allele. Burwinkel et al.
(1998) thought that the N338S mutation was probably the second disease
mutation because codon N338 is absolutely conserved in all 3 isoforms of
glycogen phosphorylase and also conserved in plants, yeast, and
bacterial phosphorylases; the same cannot be said for the V221.

GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE VI
PYGL, ASN338SER

See 613741.0002 and Burwinkel et al. (1998).

.0004
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE VI
PYGL, ASN376LYS

In a girl with glycogen storage disease VI (232700), the daughter of
consanguineous Turkish parents, Burwinkel et al. (1998) found
homozygosity for an asn376-to-lys missense (N376K) mutation in the PYGL
gene. The patient presented with hepatomegaly at the age of 1 year. Body
length was at the fiftieth percentile, but weight was at the tenth
percentile. Transaminases, triglycerides, and cholesterol were elevated.
There was a heavy accumulation of glycogen in the liver.

.0005
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE VI
PYGL, IVS13DS, G-A, +1

In affected members of a Mennonite kindred with an autosomal recessive
form of glycogen storage disease (232700), Chang et al. (1998) found
that the consensus GT at the splice donor site of intron 13 was
converted to AT in the PYGL gene. This mutation predicts a PYGL protein
with a deletion of either 3 or 34 amino acids.
