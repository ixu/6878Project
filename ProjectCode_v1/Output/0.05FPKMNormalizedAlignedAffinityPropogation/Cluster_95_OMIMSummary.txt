600448	TITLE *600448 PROTEIN KINASE C, THETA; PRKCQ
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Members of the protein kinase C (PKC) family of serine/threonine kinases
play critical roles in the regulation of cellular differentiation and
proliferation of diverse cell types. In an attempt to find PKC isoforms
involved in growth control and/or activation of T lymphocytes, Baier et
al. (1993) used a human peripheral blood lymphocyte-derived cDNA library
to identify a novel PKC isoform, termed PKC-theta. The gene encodes a
protein of approximately 80 kD, expressed predominantly in lymphoid
tissues and hematopoietic cell lines, particularly T cells.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Erdel et al. (1995) assigned the
PRKCQ gene to chromosome 10p15. Blanco and Brown (1997) mapped the mouse
Prkcq homolog to chromosome 2 by analysis of an interspecific backcross.

GENE FUNCTION

In mouse mammary tumors, Belguise and Sonenshein (2007) identified Prkcq
as a positive regulator of c-Rel (REL; 164910) transcriptional activity,
as well as downstream target genes. In human breast cancer cell lines,
there was an inverse correlation between ESR1 (133430) and PRKCQ mRNA,
and PRKCQ was found to inhibit ESR1 expression via activation of AKT1
(164730). Belguise and Sonenshein (2007) concluded that PRKCQ plays a
pivotal role in mammary tumorigenesis by activating AKT1, which
ultimately leads to derepression of c-Rel through inhibition of ESR1.

Zanin-Zhorov et al. (2010) showed that PKC-theta recruitment to the
immunologic synapse is required for full effector T cell (T-eff)
activation. In contrast, PKC-theta was sequestered away from the
regulatory T cell (T-reg) immunologic synapse. Furthermore, PKC-theta
blockade enhanced T-reg function, demonstrating that PKC-theta inhibits
T-reg-mediated suppression. Inhibition of PKC-theta protected T-reg
cells from inactivation by TNF-alpha (191160), restored activity of
defective T-regs from rheumatoid arthritis (RA; 180300) patients, and
enhanced protection of mice from inflammatory colitis. Zanin-Zhorov et
al. (2010) concluded that T-reg cells freed of PKC-theta-mediated
inhibition can function in the presence of inflammatory cytokines.

ANIMAL MODEL

Sun et al. (2000) demonstrated that PKC-theta is essential for T-cell
antigen receptor (TCR)-mediated T-cell activation, but dispensable
during TCR-dependent thymocyte development. They generated mice
deficient in Pkc-theta by homologous recombination. Mutant mice were
normal and fertile. TCR-initiated NF-kappa-B (see 164011) activation was
absent from Pkc-theta -/- mature T lymphocytes, but was intact in
thymocytes. Activation of NF-kappa-B by tumor necrosis factor-alpha
(191160) and interleukin-1 (see 147760) was unaffected in the mutant
mice. Induction of Jnk (see 601158) was normal in T cells from mutant
mice. Sun et al. (2000) concluded that PKC-theta functions in a unique
pathway that links the TCR signaling complex to the activation of
NF-kappa-B in mature T lymphocytes.

Using hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps, Kim et al. (2004) demonstrated
that skeletal muscle and hepatic insulin action did not differ between
wildtype and Pkc-theta-null mice. A 5-hour lipid infusion decreased
insulin-stimulated skeletal muscle glucose uptake in the wildtype mice
that was associated with 40 to 50% decreases in insulin-stimulated
tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS1; 147545)
and IRS1-associated PI3K (see 171834) activity. In contrast, Pkc-theta
inactivation prevented fat-induced defects in insulin signaling and
glucose transport in skeletal muscle. Kim et al. (2004) concluded that
PKC-theta is a crucial component mediating fat-induced insulin
resistance in skeletal muscle.

Tan et al. (2006) found that Pkc-theta -/- mice resisted development of
experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model of central
nervous system (CNS) autoimmune disease. Flow cytometric and
histopathologic analyses revealed a profound reduction in T-cell and
macrophage infiltration and demyelination. Stimulation of splenic T
cells from Pkc-theta -/- mice resulted in significantly reduced
production of Ifng (147570) and Il17 (603149), despite comparable levels
of Il2 (147680) and Il4 (147780) and no difference in
lymphoproliferation. After TCR activation, Pkc-theta -/- T cells failed
to upregulate the adhesion molecule Lfa1 (see ITGB2; 600065).
Immunohistochemical analysis showed reduced expression of Il17 in the
CNS of Pkc-theta -/- mice. Tan et al. (2006) concluded that PKC-theta is
important in the regulation of multiple T-cell functions necessary for
development of autoimmune disease.

605988	TITLE *605988 DNA CROSS-LINK REPAIR PROTEIN 1C; DCLRE1C
;;ARTEMIS
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The V(D)J recombination process insures the somatic diversification of
immunoglobulin-encoding and antigen T-cell receptor-encoding genes. This
reaction is initiated by a DNA double-strand break, which is resolved by
the ubiquitously expressed DNA repair machinery. Human T-B severe
combined immunodeficiency associated with increased cellular
radiosensitivity (RS-SCID; 602450) is characterized by a defect in V(D)J
recombination leading to an early arrest of both B- and T-cell
maturation. The RS-SCID locus maps to the short arm of chromosome 10. By
analyzing chromosome 10 BAC contigs, searching sequence databases, and
RT-PCR, Moshous et al. (2001) isolated a cDNA encoding Artemis, a
protein involved in V(D)J recombination/DNA repair. The predicted
685-amino acid Artemis protein has a molecular mass of 77.6 kD and is
78% identical to the murine protein. Protein sequence analysis suggested
that Artemis belongs to the metallo-beta-lactamase superfamily. Northern
blot and RT-PCR analyses detected ubiquitous expression of Artemis.

By RT-PCR and 5-prime RACE, Li et al. (2002) determined that alternative
splicing is found with exons 2, 2b, 2c, 3b, and 5 of the Artemis gene,
resulting in at least 6 alternative transcripts in addition to the
primary transcript. Fluorescence microscopy demonstrated nuclear
localization of Artemis.

GENE FUNCTION

Ma et al. (2002) reported that Artemis forms a complex with the 469-kD
DNA-dependent protein kinase (PRKDC; 600899) in the absence of DNA. The
purified Artemis protein alone possesses single-strand-specific
5-prime-to-3-prime exonuclease activity. Upon complex formation, PRKDC
phosphorylates Artemis, and Artemis acquires endonucleolytic activity on
5-prime and 3-prime overhangs, as well as hairpins. The Artemis-PRKDS
complex can open hairpins generated by the RAG (see 179615) complex.
Thus, PRKDC regulates Artemis by both phosphorylation and complex
formation to permit enzymatic activities that are critical for the
hairpin-opening step of V(D)J recombination and for the 5-prime and
3-prime overhang processing in nonhomologous DNA end joining.

Moshous et al. (2003) presented evidence suggesting that Artemis also
acts as a 'caretaker' gene and is involved in genomic stability.

Lu et al. (2008) reported that the kinase activity of the Artemis:PRKDC
complex could be activated by hairpin DNA ends in cis, allowing nicking
of hairpins, followed by processing and joining by nonhomologous DNA end
joining. These insights enabled reconstitution of many aspects of
antigen receptor diversification of V(D)J recombination using 13 highly
purified polypeptides, thereby permitting variable domain exon assembly.
The features of the recombination sites created by this biochemical
system included all of the features observed in vivo, such as
nucleolytic resection, P nucleotides, and N nucleotide addition, and
indicated that most, if not all, of the end modification enzymes had
been identified.

To investigate the role of Artemis in nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ)
during class switch recombination (CSR), Du et al. (2008) characterized
the switch (S) recombinational junctions of Artemis-deficient human B
cells. They found that S(mu)-to-S(alpha) junctions could be amplified,
whereas S(mu)-to-S(gamma) junctions usually could not be amplified. Du
et al. (2008) concluded that impaired Artemis function results in
varying modes of CSR junction resolution for different S regions and
that Artemis is linked to the predominant NHEJ pathway during CSR.

Rivera-Munoz et al. (2009) found that mice conditionally lacking Artemis
in mature B cells exhibited reduced class switching to certain Ig
isotypes and increased DNA microhomology usage at CSR junctions.
Increased DNA microhomology usage was also found in CSR junctions of
RS-SCID patients harboring hypomorphic Artemis mutations. Rivera-Munoz
et al. (2009) concluded that Artemis participates in the repair of a
subset of DNA breaks generated during CSR.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Moshous et al. (2001) determined that the
Artemis gene contains 14 exons that range in size from 52 to 1,160 bp.

MAPPING

By BAC contig analysis, Moshous et al. (2001) mapped the Artemis gene to
chromosome 10p.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Moshous et al. (2001) identified 8 different mutations in the Artemis
gene in 13 patients from 11 families with RS-SCID.

Li et al. (2002) identified a founder mutation in exon 8 of the Artemis
gene (605988.0009) in 21 Native Americans with Athabascan-type severe
combined immunodeficiency (SCIDA; 602450). Wildtype Artemis could
complement the defective coding joint and reduced signal joint formation
in SCIDA fibroblasts.

Noordzij et al. (2003) identified 4 patients with RS-SCID on the basis
of Artemis gene mutations. One patient had a large genomic deletion, but
the other 3 carried simple missense mutations in conserved amino acid
residues in the SNM1 homology domain of the Artemis protein. The cells
containing the missense mutations had the same recombination phenotype
as the cells with the large deletion, indicating that these amino acid
residues are indispensable for Artemis function. Noordzij et al. (2003)
performed studies that demonstrated a complete B-cell differentiation
arrest at the pre-B-cell receptor checkpoint in bone marrow. The
completeness of this arrest illustrated the importance of Artemis at
this stage of lymphoid differentiation.

In 4 patients from 2 families with partial SCID, Moshous et al. (2003)
identified hypomorphic mutations in exon 14 of the Artemis gene
(605988.0010; 605988.0011). Both mutations spared the
metallo-beta-lactamase catalytic domain of the protein, resulting in
residual function. Two of the patients developed B-cell lymphoma, and
the authors suggested that Artemis also functions as a 'caretaker' gene,
responsible for genomic stability.

In a patient with Omenn syndrome (603554), Ege et al. (2005) identified
compound heterozygosity for hypomorphic Artemis mutations (605998.0012;
605988.0013). The patient's T cells expressed alpha/beta receptors with
an oligoclonal repertoire but normal V(D)J recombination coding joints.
Sequencing of the Artemis gene revealed compound heterozygosity in the
nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) factor encoded by the Artemis gene,
explaining the enhanced radiosensitivity of the patient's primary dermal
fibroblasts. The maternal allele contained a null mutation with the
active center, whereas the expression of the paternal allele with a
mutation in the start codon partially restored V(D)J recombination and
Artemis function in vivo and in vitro.

About 60% of DCLRE1C and IGHM (147020) gene defects involve gross
deletions, compared with about 6% of BTK (300300) gene defects. Van Zelm
et al. (2008) compared gross deletion breakpoints involving DCLRE1C,
IGHM, and BTK to identify mechanisms underlying these differences in
gross deletion frequencies. Their analysis suggested that gross
deletions involve transposable elements or large homologous regions
rather than recombination motifs. Van Zelm et al. (2008) hypothesized
that the transposable element content of a gene is related to its gross
deletion frequency.

ANIMAL MODEL

Rooney et al. (2002) reported that Artemis-deficient mice had an overall
phenotype similar to that of Prkdc-deficient mice, including severe
combined immunodeficiency associated with defects in opening and joining
V(D)J-coding hairpin ends and increased cellular ionizing radiation
sensitivity. While these findings supported the notion that Artemis
functions with PRKDC in a subset of nonhomologous DNA end-joining
functions, differences between Artemis- and Prkdc-deficient phenotypes,
most notably decreased fidelity of V(D)J signal sequence joining in
Prkdc-deficient but not Artemis-deficient fibroblasts, suggested
additional functions for PRKDC. Artemis deficiency led to chromosomal
instability in fibroblasts, demonstrating that Artemis functions as a
genomic caretaker.

Li et al. (2005) generated mice lacking Artemis and confirmed the
findings of Rooney et al. (2002). Hemopoietic stem cell transplants in
Artemis-deficient mice resulted in discordant reconstitution with a
preference for the T-cell compartment, similar to observations in
children with SCIDA.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
SEVERE COMBINED IMMUNODEFICIENCY WITH SENSITIVITY TO IONIZING RADIATION
DCLRE1C, ARG74TER

In 3 unrelated patients with RS-SCID (602450), Moshous et al. (2001)
identified a C-to-T transition at nucleotide 279 of the Artemis gene,
resulting in an arg74-to-ter (R74X) substitution. Patient P2 was
homozygous for R74X, while patients P1 and P4 were compound heterozygous
for R74X and a genomic deletion of exons 1 to 4 (605988.0002) and an
exon 10 splice donor site mutation (605988.0005), respectively.

.0002
SEVERE COMBINED IMMUNODEFICIENCY WITH SENSITIVITY TO IONIZING RADIATION
DCLRE1C, EX1-4DEL

In 4 unrelated patients with RS-SCID (602450), Moshous et al. (2001)
identified a deletion of exons 1 to 4 of the Artemis gene, resulting in
a complete absence of Artemis transcript. Patients P6, P15, and P40 were
homozygous for the mutation, while patient P1 was compound heterozygous
for the deletion of exons 1 to 4 and an arg74-to-ter substitution
(605988.0001).

.0003
SEVERE COMBINED IMMUNODEFICIENCY WITH SENSITIVITY TO IONIZING RADIATION
DCLRE1C, EX5-6DEL

In a patient (P3) with RS-SCID (602450), Moshous et al. (2001)
identified a deletion of exons 5 to 6 of the Artemis gene, resulting in
the out-of-frame splicing of exons 4 to 7 and a frameshift at lys96. The
patient was compound heterozygous for this mutation and an exon 11
splice donor site mutation (605988.0004).

.0004
SEVERE COMBINED IMMUNODEFICIENCY WITH SENSITIVITY TO IONIZING RADIATION
DCLRE1C, IVS11DS, G-C, +1

In a patient (P3) with RS-SCID (602450), Moshous et al. (2001)
identified a splicing mutation (G to C) in the first nucleotide of the
donor consensus sequence of intron 11 of the Artemis gene, resulting in
an out-of-frame splicing of exons 10 to 12 and a frameshift at thr300.
The patient was compound heterozygous for this mutation and a deletion
of exons 5 to 6 (605988.0003).

.0005
SEVERE COMBINED IMMUNODEFICIENCY WITH SENSITIVITY TO IONIZING RADIATION
DCLRE1C, IVS10DS, G-A, +1

In a patient (P4) with RS-SCID (602450), Moshous et al. (2001)
identified a splicing mutation (G to A) in the first nucleotide of the
donor consensus sequence of intron 10 of the Artemis gene, resulting in
an in-frame splicing of exons 9 to 12 and potentially leading to a
protein that lacks ala261 to glu317. The patient was compound
heterozygous for this mutation and an arg74-to-ter substitution
(605988.0001).

.0006
SEVERE COMBINED IMMUNODEFICIENCY WITH SENSITIVITY TO IONIZING RADIATION
DCLRE1C, IVS5DS, G-T, +1

In 4 patients (P5, P11, P12, and P38) from 2 families with RS-SCID
(602450), Moshous et al. (2001) identified a splicing mutation (G to T)
in the first nucleotide of the donor consensus sequence of intron 5 of
the Artemis gene, resulting in an out-of-frame splicing of exons 4 to 6
and a frameshift at lys96. The patients were homozygous for this
mutation.

.0007
SEVERE COMBINED IMMUNODEFICIENCY WITH SENSITIVITY TO IONIZING RADIATION
DCLRE1C, 1-BP DEL, 818G

In a patient (P16) with RS-SCID (602450), Moshous et al. (2001)
identified a 1-bp deletion (G) at nucleotide 818 in exon 9 of the
Artemis gene, resulting in a frameshift after codon ala254. The patient
was homozygous.

.0008
SEVERE COMBINED IMMUNODEFICIENCY WITH SENSITIVITY TO IONIZING RADIATION
DCLRE1C, EX5-8DEL

In a patient (P47) with RS-SCID (602450), Moshous et al. (2001)
identified a deletion of exons 5 to 8 of the Artemis gene, resulting in
an in-frame splicing of exons 4 to 9 and potentially leading to a
protein that lacks lys96 to gln219. This patient was homozygous.

.0009
SEVERE COMBINED IMMUNODEFICIENCY, ATHABASCAN-TYPE
DCLRE1C, TYR192TER

Li et al. (2002) identified a homozygous C-to-A transversion in exon 8
of the DCLRE1C gene in 17 of 18 Navajo and 3 of 3 Apache patients with
Athabascan-type severe combined immunodeficiency (SCIDA; 602450). The
mutation truncated the Artemis protein at tyr192 (Y192X) and created an
NspI restriction enzyme site in exon 8 of the gene, leading to a simple
assay to confirm the mutation and the heterozygous status for patients
and carriers. Li et al. (2002) estimated that the Y192X mutation is
carried by 2.1% of Navajo and Apache (Athabascan-speaking) Native
Americans.

.0010
SEVERE COMBINED IMMUNODEFICIENCY, PARTIAL
DCLRE1C, 7-BP DEL

In 3 sibs with partial SCID (602450), 2 of whom developed B-cell
lymphomas, Moshous et al. (2003) identified compound heterozygosity for
2 mutations in the Artemis gene: a 7-bp deletion (1384-1390) in exon 14,
resulting in a premature stop codon 10 amino acids downstream, and a
null mutation (605988.0002). The 7-bp deletion in exon 14 spared the
metallo-beta-lactamase catalytic region of the protein, and functional
expression studies showed that the mutant protein retained residual
activity. All patients had decreased levels of polyclonal T and B cells,
indicating that a low level of V(D)J recombination had occurred.

.0011
SEVERE COMBINED IMMUNODEFICIENCY, PARTIAL
DCLRE1C, 17-BP DEL

In a patient with partial SCID (602450), Moshous et al. (2003)
identified a homozygous 17-bp deletion in exon 14 of the Artemis gene,
resulting in a premature stop codon 15 amino acids downstream. The
deletion spared the metallo-beta-lactamase catalytic region of the
protein, predicting residual functional activity.

.0012
OMENN SYNDROME
DCLRE1C, MET1THR

In a 5-month-old male infant with Omenn syndrome (603554), Ege et al.
(2005) identified compound heterozygosity for mutations in the Artemis
gene: inherited from his father, a T-to-C transition, resulting in a
met1-to-thr substitution (M1T), and a C-to-G transversion, resulting in
a his35-to-asp substitution (H35D; 605988.0013), inherited from his
mother. The maternal H35D allele contained a null mutation within the
active center of the protein, whereas expression of the paternal M1T
allele with a start codon mutation partially restored V(D)J
recombination and Artemis function in vivo and vitro. The healthy
nonconsanguineous parents had 2 older sons who both died with
manifestations consistent with Omenn syndrome. The eldest son presented
with erythrodermatitis and died at the age of 11 months of atypical
pneumonia. The second son died at the age of 5 years of aspergillosis
(see 614079). He suffered from thrombocytopenia and autoimmune hemolytic
anemia, which were considered to represent Evans syndrome. The deceased
second brother had the same compound heterozygous mutations as were
found in the proband.

605341	TITLE *605341 PAIRED IMMUNOGLOBULIN-LIKE TYPE 2 RECEPTOR, ALPHA; PILRA
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using an SHP1 (176883) mutant as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a
mammary gland cDNA library, followed by 5-prime RACE, Mousseau et al.
(2000) identified a cDNA encoding PILRA (paired immunoglobulin-like
receptor-alpha). Sequence analysis predicted that the 303-amino acid
PILRA protein does not contain an Ig domain per se, but does contain an
Ig-like cysteine-based motif involved in intradomain disulfide bonding.
PILRA also has a potential N-glycosylation site; numerous
O-glycosylation sites; a transmembrane domain; and 3 potential tyrosine
phosphorylation sites, 2 of which are within an immunoreceptor
tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM). When expressed in a kidney cell
line, immunoblot and BIAcore analysis showed that the approximately
50-kD PILRA glycoprotein was tyrosine-phosphorylated and coprecipitated
with SHP1 through a C-terminal tyrosine. Northern blot analysis revealed
strong expression of a 1.4-kb transcript in peripheral blood leukocytes,
with lower signals in lung, spleen, and placenta as well as in 2 B-cell
lines. RT-PCR analysis indicated that PILRA and PILRB (605342) are
expressed, or paired, at the mRNA level in various tissues. Mousseau et
al. (2000) concluded that PILRA and PILRB represent a novel
immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM)-bearing and
non-ITIM-bearing receptor pair.

By random sequencing of an activated monocyte cDNA library, Fournier et
al. (2000) cloned PILRA, which they termed FDF03. RT-PCR analysis
identified 2 splice variants lacking transmembrane domains and
presumably encoding soluble proteins. RT-PCR and flow cytometry analysis
demonstrated expression of PILRA in peripheral blood-derived monocytes,
granulocytes, and particularly dendritic cells, but not in lymphocytes.
Western blot analysis of a monocyte cell line expressing PILRA suggested
that PILRA recruits SHP2 (PTPN11; 176876) more efficiently than it
recruits SHP1, whereas LAIR1 (602992), which is also an inhibitory
molecule, recruits both molecules equivalently. In contrast to LAIR1,
crosslinking of PILRA did not inhibit the differentiation of monocytes
into dendritic cells in the presence of GMCSF (CSF2; 138960).

GENE FUNCTION

Satoh et al. (2008) noted that herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 infection
requires viral glycoprotein B (gB). Using flow cytometric,
immunoprecipitation, and fluorescence microscopy analyses, they showed
that PILRA associated with gB and that cells transduced with PILRA
became susceptible to HSV-1 infection. Infection of cells expressing
both PILRA and HVEM (TNFRSF14; 602746), a receptor for HSV-1 gD, could
be blocked with antibody to either receptor, indicating that cellular
receptors for both gB and gD are required for HSV-1 infection. Satoh et
al. (2008) concluded that PILRA is a coreceptor for HSV-1 infection that
associates with gB.

GENE STRUCTURE

Mousseau et al. (2000) determined that the PILRA gene contains 7 exons
and spans approximately 26.7 kb.

MAPPING

By long-range PCR on genomic DNA and comparison to a chromosome 7
segment (GenBank GENBANK RG161A02), Mousseau et al. (2000) mapped the
PILRA gene to chromosome 7, 5.6 kb downstream from PILRB. Using
radiation hybrid analysis, Fournier et al. (2000) mapped the PILRA gene
to 7q22, a localization distinct from inhibitory receptor gene families
such as LIR (e.g., LILRB1; 604811) on chromosome 19 and the natural
killer cell receptors (e.g., KLRG1; 604874) on chromosome 12. The
localization of PILRA is close, however, to a region associated with
chromosomal abnormalities in the myelodysplastic syndrome and acute
myeloid leukemia.

612399	TITLE *612399 TRANSDUCIN-LIKE ENHANCER OF SPLIT 6; TLE6
;;GROUCHO-RELATED GENE 6; GRG6
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Dang et al. (2001) cloned mouse Tle6, which they called Grg6. The
deduced 581-amino acid protein shares significant similarity with the
Drosophila groucho protein, particularly in the C-terminal WD40 repeat
region. Northern blot analysis showed that Grg6 was expressed
predominantly in heart, lung, liver, muscle, and testis, with very low
expression in brain, spleen, and kidney.

GENE FUNCTION

Using representational difference analysis, Dang et al. (2001) found
that the oncogenic E2A (TCF3; 147141)/HLF (142385) fusion protein
upregulated expression of Grg6 and several other groucho-related genes
following expression in a mouse pro-B cell line. A mutant E2A/HLF
protein lacking DNA-binding activity also stimulated Grg6 expression.

Li et al. (2008) identified a subcortical maternal complex (SCMC) in
mouse that assembled during oocyte growth and was essential for zygotes
to progress beyond the first embryonic cell division. Within this large
complex, Floped (OOEP; 611689), Mater (NRLP5; 609658), and Tle6
interacted with each other, and Filia independently bound Mater.
Although the transcripts encoding these proteins were degraded during
meiotic maturation and ovulation, the SCMC persisted in the early
embryo. The SCMC, which was located in the subcortex of the egg, was
excluded from regions of cell-cell contact in the cleavage-stage embryo
and segregated to the outer cells of the morulae and blastocyst. Oocytes
lacking Floped and/or Mater were fertilized, but the embryos did not
progress beyond the cleavage stage of development, and female mice
lacking Floped and/or Mater were sterile.

MAPPING

Hartz (2008) mapped the TLE6 gene to chromosome 19p13.3 based on an
alignment of the TLE6 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK024071) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.1).

140556	TITLE *140556 HEAT-SHOCK 70-KD PROTEIN 7; HSPA7
;;HSP70B
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using the coding region of Drosophila Hsp70 to screen a human genomic
phage library, Voellmy et al. (1985) cloned a segment of a gene encoding
a 70-kD heat shock protein, designated HSP70B by Schiller et al. (1988).

Leung et al. (1990) found high sequence homology between HSP70B (HSPA7)
and HSPA6 (140555), formerly designated HSP70B-prime. Leung et al.
(1992) stated that both HSPA6 and HSPA7 represent functional genes, as
determined by analyses of mRNA from heat-shocked human cells using
sequence-specific oligonucleotides. After heat shock at 45 degrees C,
HSPA6 mRNA was detected in fibroblast, HeLa, and Daudi cells, whereas
HSPA7 mRNA was detected only in fibroblasts.

Parsian et al. (2000) presented evidence that HSPA7 does not encode a
full-length functional protein. They did not detect orthologs of HSPA7
or HSPA6 in mouse by Southern blot analysis.

GENE FUNCTION

Using Xenopus and mammalian cells, Voellmy et al. (1985) demonstrated
that the expression of HSPA7 mRNA is heat regulated. Using RT-PCR,
Parsian et al. (2000) detected the expression of HSPA7 and HSPA6 only
after heat shock in human W138 and HeLa cells. HSPA6 was more strongly
expressed following heat shock.

GENE STRUCTURE

Voellmy et al. (1985) determined that the promoter region of the HSPA7
gene is GC-rich and lacks CCAAT and TATA elements. Schiller et al.
(1988) extended the upstream nucleotide sequence of HSPA7 and identified
4 potential heat shock transcription factor recognition sites. They also
identified upstream CCAAT-like sequence and many potential SP1
(189906)-binding sites.

MAPPING

By hybridization analyses of a somatic cell hybrid DNA panel, Leung et
al. (1992) found that HSPA6 and HSPA7 localize to 1q. A BamHI
polymorphism in the HSPA7 gene was present in a predominantly Asian
population.

Grosz et al. (1992) concluded that bovine HSP70-4 is homologous to HSPA6
or HSPA7 because it is syntenic with amylase-1 (104700) and PGM1
(171900), both of which are on human chromosome 1.

Using FISH, Parsian et al. (2000) mapped the HSPA6 and HSPA7 genes to
within 5 to 10 Mb of each other on chromosome 1q23.1.

Brzustowicz et al. (2002) stated that the HSPA6 and HSPA7 genes are
located on chromosome 1q22, according to sequence data provided by the
Human Genome Project, and are in close proximity to a susceptibility
locus for schizophrenia (604906).

602015	TITLE *602015 OUTER DENSE FIBER OF SPERM TAILS 2; ODF2
;;OUTER DENSE FIBER OF SPERM TAILS, 84-KD; ODF84
CENEXIN 1, INCLUDED;;
CENEXIN 1 VARIANT 1, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ODF2 encodes multiple protein isoforms that have roles in the formation
of primary cilia and sperm flagella and in coordinating ciliary beating
(Kunimoto et al., 2012).

CLONING

See ODF1 (182878). Brohmann et al. (1997) used antibodies against Odf
proteins to screen a rat testis expression library and isolated the rat
Odf2 gene. Sequence analysis revealed that the protein has an overall
alpha-helical structure with 2 regions identical to the dimerization
region of a leucine zipper motif. Brohmann et al. (1997) documented Odf2
cDNAs with 3 different 5-prime end sequences, presumed to be the result
of alternative splicing. They found expression of the rat gene only in
testis.

The EST database contains several human cDNA sequences which are closely
related to rat Odf2, suggesting that a human homolog exists (Scott,
1997). These human cDNA sequences were derived from testis, epididymis,
and fetal brain libraries.

Shao et al. (1997) used a yeast 2-hybrid screening with the leucine
zipper region of ODF1 (ODF27; Shao and van der Hoorn, 1996) as bait to
isolate rat testis-specific proteins that could interact with ODF27.
They demonstrated that one of the novel genes isolated encoded the 84-kD
ODF protein ODF2.

Soung et al. (2006) stated that the deduced 638-amino acid ODF2 protein
has 2 leucine zipper motifs in its C-terminal half. Using an inactive
mutant of the mitotic kinase PLK1 (602098) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid
screen of a human testis cDNA library, followed by RT-PCR of HeLa cell
RNA, they identified 2 splice variants of ODF2 that they called
cenexin-1 and cenexin-1 variant-1. Cenexin-1 and cenexin-1 variant-1
encode proteins of 805 and 824 amino acids, respectively. Both isoforms
contain a C-terminal extension compared with ODF2, and cenexin-1
variant-1 also has a 19-amino acid insertion near its N-terminal end.
Northern blot analysis of synchronized HeLa cells detected a single
transcript of about 4.0 kb, representing cenexin-1. Cenexin-1 localized
at the microtubule-organizing center in interphase and at spindle poles
in mitosis, suggesting that cenexin-1 is a centrosomal protein.
Fluorescence-tagged cenexin-1 primarily localized to the mother
centrosome in interphase and to both mother and daughter centrosomes in
mitosis.

Using real-time RT-PCR with a probe for the 3-prime region of mouse
Odf2/cenexin, Kunimoto et al. (2012) detected highest expression in
mouse trachea and lung, with much lower expression in brain, and little
to no expression in heart, liver, and kidney. Western blot analysis
using an antibody against the N-terminal region of Odf2/cenexin detected
an apparent 75-kD protein in mouse testis and an apparent 90-kD protein
in mouse trachea, lung, kidney, brain, and oviduct.

GENE STRUCTURE

Soung et al. (2006) determined that the ODF2 gene contains 21 exons and
spans 44.8 kb.

MAPPING

By FISH, Shao et al. (1998) mapped the human ODF2 gene to chromosome
9q34. Soung et al. (2006) mapped the ODF2 gene to chromosome 9q34.11 by
genomic sequence analysis.

GENE FUNCTION

Using protein pull-down and coimmunoprecipitation analyses, Soung et al.
(2006) confirmed that cenexin-1 interacted directly with PLK1. Mutation
analysis revealed that the C-terminal domain of cenexin-1 interacted
with the polo-box domain of PLK1. The C-terminal domain of cenexin-1 was
also required to recruit PLK1 to centrosomes. Depletion of cenexin-1
from HeLa cells delocalized centrosomal PLK1, diminished gamma-tubulin
(see 191135) recruitment to centrosomes, and altered localization of a
subset of centrosomal proteins required for microtubule nucleation and
function. Depletion of cenexin-1 also resulted in severe mitotic
defects, including chromosome alignment and segregation defects. A
significant fraction of these cells also showed multipolar chromosomes
and apoptotic cell death.

ANIMAL MODEL

Kunimoto et al. (2012) developed a line of mice with deletion of exons 6
and 7 of Odf2, which they called Odf2(delta-ex6,7) mice. Homozygous
Odf2(delta-ex6,7) mice were born at the expected mendelian ratio, but
only 20% survived past weaning. Surviving mice were characterized by a
coughing/sneezing-like phenotype, sinusitis, otitis media, and a slight
tendency to hydrocephaly, suggesting primary ciliary dyskinesia. Unlike
Odf2 -/- F9 embryonic mouse carcinoma cells, homozygous
Odf2(delta-ex6,7) mice were born with primary cilia and expressed low
levels of N-terminally truncated Odf2/cenexin. Antibody raised against
the Odf2/cenexin C-terminal region detected slight immunofluorescence at
the base of cilia in homozygous Odf2(delta-ex6,7) tracheal cells, but
not in Odf2 -/- F9 cells. Cilium appeared to nucleate from the basal
body in Odf2(delta-ex6,7) cells, but the basal foot was completely lost,
and basal bodies failed to position apically in some cells. Basal feet
were also absent in oviduct epithelial cells and ependymal cells in
brains of homozygous Odf2(delta-ex6,7) mice. Live imaging of isolated
Odf2(delta-ex6,7) trachea preparations revealed uncoordinated ciliary
beating and inefficient fluid flow across the luminal surface.
Deficiency of full-length Odf2/cenexin also perturbed the polarized
distribution of planar cell polarity (PCP) proteins and PCP-dependent
apical organization of microtubules.

603011	TITLE *603011 SMALL EDRK-RICH FACTOR 1A; SERF1A
;;SMALL EDRK-RICH FACTOR 1; SERF1;;
SPINAL MUSCULAR ATROPHY-RELATED GENE H4F5; H4F5;;
SMA MODIFIER 1; SMAM1
DESCRIPTION Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) has been classified into 3 types based on
age of onset and severity. SMA I-III all map to 5q13, and nearly all
patients display deletions or gene conversions of the SMN1 gene
(600354). Although some correlation has been established between SMN
protein levels and disease course, the genetic basis for SMA phenotypic
variability is mainly unexplained, and it had been postulated that the
loss of an additional modifying factor contributes to the severity of
type I SMA. Scharf et al. (1998) found that a multicopy microsatellite
marker deleted in more than 90% of type I SMA chromosomes was embedded
in an intron of H4F5, indicating that this gene is also highly deleted
in type I SMA chromosomes, and thus is a candidate phenotypic modifier
for SMA. The microsatellite marker, designated C212, is located in the
last intron of H4F5, 5 kb upstream of H4F5 exon 3b and 13 kb upstream of
SMN exon 1. In 58 type I SMA patients of varied European and Arabian
descent, Scharf et al. (1998) found a reduction or absence of C212/H4F5
alleles in 94% of chromosomes, implying a deletion of 1 or both copies
of the marker and therefore of H4F5 exon 3b in these individuals. In
comparison with the high rate of C212/H4F5 deletions in type I SMA, the
C212 deletion frequency in type II SMA chromosomes was between that of
type I and control chromosomes, whereas deletions in type III
chromosomes were only slightly more frequent than in controls.

Scharf et al. (1998) sequenced a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)
containing the mouse Smn gene to identify conserved elements between the
human SMA interval and its previously identified syntenic region on
mouse chromosome 13 (Scharf et al., 1996). The resulting sequence was
filtered for repetitive elements and used to screen the EST database.
ESTs corresponding to SMN and NAIP were identified as well as 2 ESTs
representing novel genes within the BAC. One of these ESTs, clone
368449, mapped to 10.6 kb upstream of mouse Smn; subsequent analysis of
surrounding genomic sequences using 4 exon-prediction programs
identified no additional transcripts between 368449 and Smn or between
Smn and Naip. The full-length 566-bp mouse 368449 cDNA and its human
ortholog were cloned from a mouse brain and human skeletal muscle cDNA
library, respectively. The human clone was 99% homologous to exon 4F5,
an exon previously trapped from an SMA cosmid known to contain SMN exon
1. The full-length human cDNA was named H4F5, and its mouse counterpart
M4f5, until an appropriate function can be assigned to the 2 genes. The
proteins displayed 97% amino acid similarity to one another and both
genes were ubiquitously expressed with highest RNA levels in testis. In
addition, H4F5 has a larger 1.8-kb isoform, H4F5L, with a predicted
110-amino acid open reading frame that results from alternative splicing
of exon 3. In contrast to the 0.6-kb mouse and 0.7-kb human 4F5S
isoforms, the 1.8-kb H4F5L transcript is predominantly expressed in
heart, brain, and skeletal muscle. Both isoforms are also expressed
throughout the central nervous system, including spinal cord, which is

SMN1 than any previously identified gene in the region.

176875	TITLE *176875 PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE 1, CATALYTIC SUBUNIT, ALPHA ISOFORM; PPP1CA
;;PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE 1, ALPHA SUBUNIT; PPP1A
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Protein phosphorylation, a crucial posttranslational modification that
controls many diverse cellular functions, is dependent on the opposing
actions of protein kinases and protein phosphatases. Protein
phosphatase-1 (PP1) is 1 of 4 major protein phosphatases identified in
the cytosol of eukaryotic cells that are responsible for the
dephosphorylation of serine and threonine residues in proteins. Although
all 4 protein phosphatases have overlapping substrate specificities in
vitro, they can be distinguished by the use of inhibitor proteins and by
their dependence on metal ions. PP1 is inhibited by nanomolar
concentrations of 2 thermostable proteins, inhibitor-1 (PPP1R1A; 613246)
and inhibitor-2 (PPP1R2; 601792), whereas the other 3 phosphatases (see
PPP2CA; 176915) are unaffected by these inhibitors. PPP1CA encodes a
catalytic subunit of PP1 that forms heterodimers with various PP1
regulatory subunits (e.g., PPP1R3A; 600917). These regulatory subunits
target PP1 to particular subcellular locations and selectively enhance
its activity toward certain substrates (Cohen and Cohen, 1989).

CLONING

Barker et al. (1990) isolated a cDNA encoding 1 isoform (PP1-alpha) of
the catalytic subunit of human protein phosphatase-1.

Using 2 regions conserved within PP1 genes, Song et al. (1993) amplified
a partial PPP1CA sequence by PCR, and they screened a cDNA library using
this product to obtain a full-length clone. The deduced 330-amino acid
protein shows complete concordance with the rabbit protein. Northern
blot analysis revealed 1.6-kb transcript.

GENE FUNCTION

Genoux et al. (2002) demonstrated that PP1 determined the efficacy of
learning and memory by limiting acquisition and favoring memory decline.
When PP1 is genetically inhibited during learning, short intervals
between training episodes are sufficient for optimal performance.
Enhanced learning correlates with increased phosphorylation of CREB
(123810), of CAMKII (114078), and of the GLUR1 subunit of the AMPA
receptor (138248); it also correlates with CREB-dependent gene
expression that, in control mice, occurs only with widely distributed
training. Inhibition to PP1 prolongs memory when induced after learning,
suggesting that PP1 also promotes forgetting. Genoux et al. (2002)
suggested that this property may account for age-related cognitive
decay, as old mutant mice had preserved memory. They concluded that
their findings emphasized the physiologic importance of PP1 as a
suppressor of learning and memory, and as a potential mediator of
cognitive decline during aging.

Danial et al. (2003) undertook a proteomic analysis to assess whether
BAD (603167) might participate in mitochondrial physiology. In liver
mitochondria, BAD resides in a functional holoenzyme complex together
with protein kinase A (see 176911) and PP1 catalytic units, WAVE1
(605035) as an A kinase-anchoring protein, and glucokinase (138079).
Using mitochondria from hepatocytes of Bad-deficient mice, Danial et al.
(2003) demonstrated that BAD is required to assemble the complex, the
lack of which results in diminished mitochondria-based glucokinase
activity and blunted mitochondrial respiration in response to glucose.
Glucose deprivation results in dephosphorylation of BAD, and
BAD-dependent cell death.

In CT26 mouse colon cancer cells, Obeid et al. (2007) demonstrated that
anthracyclins induced immunogenic cell death by way of a rapid,
preapoptotic translocation of calreticulin (CALR; 109091) to the cell
surface. Anthracyclin-induced Calr translocation was mimicked by
inhibition of the Ppp1ca/Gadd34 (PPP1R15A; 611048) complex.
Administration of recombinant Calr or inhibitors of Ppp1ca/Gadd34
restored the immunogenicity of cell death elicited by etoposide and
mitomycin C and enhanced their antitumor effects in vivo.

Novoyatleva et al. (2008) identified a consensus PP1-binding motif,
RVxF, in the RNA recognition motifs of several splicing factors,
including TRA2-beta (SFRS10; 602719), SF2/ASF (SFRS1; 600812), and
SRp30c (SFRS9; 601943). PP1 bound directly to this motif in TRA2-beta
and dephosphorylated the protein, altering its interaction with other
proteins. Reducing PP1 activity promoted usage of numerous alternative
exons, including the inclusion of the SMN2 (601627) exon 7 in mice
expressing the human gene. Novoyatleva et al. (2008) concluded that PP1
has a role in splice site selection.

By immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometric analysis of PP1 complexes
in HEK293 cells, Lee et al. (2010) identified a complex containing PNUTS
(PPP1R10; 603771), TOX4 (614032), WDR82 (611059), and any 1 of the 3 PP1
catalytic subunits, PP1-alpha, PP1-beta (PPP1CB; 600590), or PP1-gamma
(PPP1CC; 176914). The complex, which they called PTW/PP1, had an
apparent molecular mass of about 200 kD, suggesting that it contains 1
molecule of each subunit. Mutation analysis revealed that human
PP1-alpha interacted with the RVxF motif of mouse Pnuts. PP1-alpha did
not interact directly with human TOX4 and WDR82. The PTW/PP1 complex
efficiently dephosphorylated the isolated C-terminal domain of the large
subunit of mouse RNA polymerase II (POLR2A; 180660) in vitro. The
PTW/PP1 complex was stable throughout the cell cycle in HEK293 cells,
but its association with chromatin was regulated. PTW/PP1 associated
with chromatin during interphase, was excluded from condensed
chromosomes during early mitosis, and was reloaded onto chromosomes at
late telophase.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Terrak et al. (2004) demonstrated the crystal structure at 2.7-angstrom
resolution of the complex between PP1 and a 34-kD N-terminal domain of
the myosin phosphatase targeting subunit MYPT1 (602021). MYPT1 is the
protein that regulates PP1 function in smooth muscle relaxation.
Structural elements amino- and carboxy-terminal to the RVXF motif of
MYPT1 are positioned in a way that leads to a pronounced reshaping of
the catalytic cleft of PP1, contributing to the increased myosin
specificity of this complex. Terrak et al. (2004) concluded that the
structure has general implications for the control of PP1 activity by
other regulatory subunits.

MAPPING

Barker et al. (1990) mapped the PPP1A gene to 11q13 by Southern analysis
of somatic cell hybrids and by in situ hybridization. Because of
evidence that PP1-alpha is a tumor suppressor and because of the
assignment to 11q13, PPP1A is a candidate gene for type I multiple
endocrine neoplasia (131100), which maps to the same area.
Translocations involving breakpoints at 11q13 have been observed in
lymphomas, chronic lymphocytic leukemia of the B-cell type (see 151400),
and multiple myeloma. Other oncogenes or suppressors mapping to 11q13
include HST (164980), INT2 (164950), SEA (165110), and ST3 (191181).

Richard et al. (1991) described a high resolution radiation hybrid map
of 11q12-q13, which placed the PPP1A locus at the extreme end of a
cluster of more than 12 genes with C1NH (606860) at the other end and
with GST3 (134660) as its closest neighbor in the linear array. Using
fluorescence in situ hybridization, Saadat et al. (1995) mapped PPP1CA
to human 11q13, rat 1q43, and mouse 7E3-F2. The results indicated that
PPP1CA is a member of a group of genes showing homology of synteny.

ANIMAL MODEL

Carr et al. (2002) noted that increased PP1 activity has been observed
in end-stage human heart failure. They developed a mouse model for
cardiac tissue-specific overexpression of PP1 by introducing PPP1CA
inserted downstream of the mouse alpha-myosin heavy chain promoter.
Overexpression of PP1 was associated with depressed cardiac function,
dilated cardiomyopathy, and premature mortality, consistent with heart
failure. Knockout of Ipp1 was associated with moderate increases in PP1
activity and impaired beta-adrenergic contractile responses. Expression
of constitutively active IPP1 in failing human myocytes in culture was
associated with rescue of beta-adrenergic responsiveness.

603698	TITLE *603698 GOLGI-SPECIFIC BREFELDIN-A RESISTANCE FACTOR 1; GBF1
DESCRIPTION Members of the Sec7 domain family share a conserved region that forms a
catalytic fold with guanine nucleotide exchange activity. In vitro, the
Sec7 domain of several proteins catalyzes the activation of
ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs; see 103180), suggesting that members of
the Sec7 domain family represent specific guanine nucleotide exchange
factors for the ARF GTPase family. Nagase et al. (1996) isolated
KIAA0248, a partial cDNA from immature myeloid cells encoding a protein
with homology to S. cerevisiae Sec7. Using 5-prime RACE, Mansour et al.
(1998) isolated a cDNA corresponding to the remainder of the coding
sequence. They designated the gene GBF1 (Golgi-specific brefeldin A
resistance factor-1). The predicted 1,859-amino acid protein has a pI of
5.55 and contains a Sec7 domain and a proline-rich C terminus. A 7-kb
GBF1 mRNA was expressed in all tissues tested by Northern blot analysis.

By analysis of a somatic cell hybrid panel and by fluorescence in situ
hybridization, Mansour et al. (1998) mapped the GBF1 gene to 10q24.
Another Sec7 domain family member, PSD (602327), maps to the same
region.

610973	TITLE *610973 MEMBRANE PROTEIN, PALMITOYLATED 7; MPP7
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Membrane-associated guanylate kinases (MAGUKs) are important adaptor
proteins involved in the assembly of protein complexes at sites of
cell-cell contact. They are found in synapses, adherens junctions, and
tight junctions. All MAGUKs contain at least 1 PDZ domain, an SH3
domain, and a GUK domain, and many contain 1 or 2 L27 domains, which are
involved in multimerization of MAGUKs. MPP7 belongs to the p55 stardust
subfamily of MAGUKs, which is named for a Drosophila gene required for
establishment of cell polarity in the developing fly embryo (Bohl et
al., 2007).

CLONING

By searching databases for homologs of MPP5 (606958), Katoh and Katoh
(2004) identified MPP7. The deduced 576-amino acid protein has 2 L27
domains (L27N and L27C) at its N terminus, followed by a PDZ domain, an
SH3 domain, and a C-terminal GUK domain. It shares 93% amino acid
identity with mouse Mpp7, 76% identity with the zebrafish humpback
protein, and 56% identity with human MPP3 (601114). In silico expression
analysis suggested that MPP7 is widely expressed.

GENE FUNCTION

Bohl et al. (2007) found that MPP7 formed a tripartite complex with DLG1
(601014) and LIN7A (603380) or LIN7C in vitro and in vivo. MPP7
dimerized with the LIN7 proteins through its L27C domain. The LIN7/MPP7
dimer then linked to DLG1 though the L27N domain of MPP7. This complex
localized to epithelial adherens junctions in transfected Madin-Darby
canine kidney cells. Expression of an MPP7 construct lacking either the
PDZ or SH3 domain redistributed MPP7, DLG1, and LIN7 into the soluble
cytoplasmic fraction.

Stucke et al. (2007) showed that the L27N domain of endogenous MPP7
bound DLG1 in human epithelial cells. The SH3-HOOK domain of MPP7
interacted with MPP5, and in turn MPP5 interacted with CRB3 (609737).
MPP7 and DLG1 colocalized at the lateral surface of epithelial cells,
and they overlapped with markers of adherens junctions and tight
junctions. Recruitment of MPP7 to the plasma membrane was dependent on
its L27N-mediated interaction with DLG1 and on CRB3-dependent
recruitment via the SH3-HOOK domain of MPP7. Loss of either DLG1 or MPP7
from epithelial cells resulted in a significant defect in assembly and
maintenance of functional tight junctions. Stucke et al. (2007)
concluded that formation of the DLG1-MPP7 complex promotes epithelial
cell polarity and tight junction formation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Katoh and Katoh (2004) determined that the MPP7 gene contains at least
19 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Katoh and Katoh (2004) mapped the MPP7
gene to chromosome 10p12.1.

DESCRIPTION

TBKBP1 is an adaptor protein that binds to TBK1 (604834) and is part of
the interaction network in the TNF (191160)/NFKB (see 164011) pathway

605747	TITLE *605747 LOW DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN RECEPTOR ADAPTOR PROTEIN 1; LDLRAP1
;;LDLR ADAPTOR PROTEIN 1;;
ARH GENE; ARH
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

LDLRAP1 is an adaptor protein that interacts with the cytoplasmic tail
of low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR; 606945), phospholipids, and
components of the clathrin (see CLTC; 118955) endocytic machinery
(Garuti et al., 2005).

CLONING

Garcia et al. (2001) cloned the ARH gene after performing linkage
analysis in families suffering from autosomal recessive
hypercholesterolemia (ARH; 603813) that mapped the ARH locus to a 1-cM
interval on chromosome 1p35. The gene encodes a 308-amino acid protein
containing a 170-amino acid phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain, which
shares considerable sequence similarity with the PTB domains of many
adaptor proteins. PTB domains bind the consensus sequence NPXY, which is
present in the cytoplasmic domains of several cell surface receptors,
including LDLR. The integrity of the NPXY sequence in the cytoplasmic
tail of LDLR is absolutely required for internalization, and LDLR has
been shown in vitro to bind other proteins containing PTB domains. The
human ARH protein shares 89% sequence identity with orthologous proteins
in mouse and Xenopus. By Northern blot analysis, Garcia et al. (2001)
found that ARH is normally expressed at high levels in the kidney,
liver, and placenta, with lower levels detectable in brain, heart,
muscle, colon, spleen, intestine, lung, and leukocytes.

Nagai et al. (2003) reported that the N-terminal half of human, rat, and
mouse ARH contains the PTB domain, and the C-terminal half contains a
clathrin box (LLDLE), a beta-2 adaptin (AP2B1; 601025)-binding site, and
a C-terminal PDZ-binding motif.

GENE FUNCTION

Using yeast 2-hybrid, pull-down, and coimmunoprecipitation assays, Nagai
et al. (2003) found that rat Arh bound the first FxNPxY motif of megalin
(LRP2; 600073). Arh colocalized with megalin in clathrin-coated pits and
in recycling endosomes in the Golgi region of rat L2 cells. Upon
internalization of megalin, megalin and Arh colocalized in
clathrin-coated pits, followed by their colocalization in early
endosomes and tubular recycling endosomes in the pericentriolar region,
and then by their reappearance at the cell surface. Expression of Arh in
canine kidney cells expressing megalin minireceptors enhanced
megalin-mediated uptake of lactoferrin (LTF; 150210), a megalin ligand.
Nagai et al. (2003) concluded that ARH facilitates endocytosis of
megalin and escorts megalin along its endocytic route.

By biochemical assays and electron microscopy, Michaely et al. (2004)
found that lymphocytes from patients with ARH deficiency had over
20-fold more LDLR on the cell surface and about 27-fold excess of LDLR
outside of coated pits. However, despite the increase in cell surface
receptors, LDL binding was only 2-fold higher in ARH-deficient
lymphocytes. Michaely et al. (2004) concluded that ARH is not only
required for internalization of the LDL-LDLR complex, but also for
efficient binding of LDL to the receptor.

By mutation analysis, Garuti et al. (2005) found that integrity of the
FDNPVY sequence in LDLR was required for ARH-associated LDLR clustering
into clathrin-coated pits in polarized hepatocytes. The
phosphotyrosine-binding domain of ARH plus either the clathrin box or
the AP2-binding region was required for LDLR clustering and
internalization. These findings were confirmed in vivo by expressing the
same ARH mutants in livers of Arh -/- mice. Garuti et al. (2005)
concluded that ARH must bind the LDLR tail and either clathrin or AP2 to
promote receptor clustering and internalization of LDL.

Sirinian et al. (2005) found that ARH codistributed with LDLR on the
basolateral surface of polarized confluent HepG2 cells. Activation of
LDLR-mediated endocytosis, but not binding of LDL to LDLR, promoted
colocalization of ARH with the LDL-LDLR complex. Depletion of ARH by
more than 70% by RNA interference caused an 80% reduction in LDL
internalization. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis of LDL-stimulated
polarized HepG2 cells showed that ARH interacted with other components
of the endocytic machinery, including beta-adaptin, DAB2 (601236), and
the small GTPase RAB4 (179511). Sirinian et al. (2005) concluded that
ARH is not constitutively associated with LDLR at the plasma membrane,
but is recruited to the membrane after LDL binding, thus facilitating
endocytosis of the LDL-LDLR complex.

GENE STRUCTURE

Garcia et al. (2001) determined that the ARH gene spans 25 kb and
contains 9 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Garcia et al. (2001) mapped the ARH gene
to chromosome 1p35.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Of the 6 mutations identified in ARH by Garcia et al. (2001), 1 was a
frameshift (605747.0002) found in homozygosity among 1 set of Sardinian
families. A nonsense mutation (605747.0003) was identified in 1 of the
Lebanese families; only trace amounts of ARH mRNA was detected in
cultured fibroblasts from patients with this mutation. The other
Lebanese family was homozygous for a missense mutation (605747.0004)
that was associated with a normal level of ARH mRNA in cultured
fibroblasts. Garcia et al. (2001) found that the defect in LDLR function
in ARH patients appeared to be not only receptor-specific, but also
tissue-specific. They were not able to identify a consistent defect in
LDLR function (binding, uptake, or internalization) in cultured
fibroblasts from ARH patients. It is possible that another PTB domain
protein compensates for the absence of ARH in cultured fibroblasts, or
that adaptor molecules are not required for receptor-mediated
endocytosis of LDL in fibroblasts and possibly other extrahepatic cells.

Arca et al. (2002) performed extensive clinical and molecular genetic
studies in 28 Sardinians with autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia
from 17 unrelated families. They sequenced the coding regions and
consensus splice sites of the ARH gene in probands from these families,
and from 40 individuals of non-Sardinian origin who had an autosomal
recessive form of hypercholesterolemia of unknown cause. In all 17
unrelated Sardinian families, 2 ARH mutations were present, 432insA in
exon 4 (605747.0002), referred to as ARH1 by them, and a nonsense
mutation, 65G-A in exon 1 (trp22 to ter; 605747.0001), referred to as
ARH2 by them. Three of the ARH alleles in the Sardinian patients
contained both mutations, as a result of an ancient recombination
between ARH1 and ARH2. No regional clustering of the 3 mutant alleles
was apparent. Furthermore, 4 Italians from the mainland with autosomal
recessive hypercholesterolemia were homozygous for ARH1. The small
number, high frequency, and dispersed distribution of ARH mutations on
Sardinia were consistent with these mutations being ancient and
maintained in the Sardinian population because of geographic isolation.

Mishra et al. (2002) showed that the ARH protein is a component of the
endocytic machinery, with mutations of the ARH gene contributing to the
LDL-uptake-disease phenotype of ARH patients. PTB domains of the ARH
protein bind to the internalization motif of the LDL receptor. The
authors showed that in addition, ARH binds directly to soluble clathrin
trimers and to clathrin adaptors. At steady state, ARH colocalizes with
endocytic proteins in HeLa cells, and the LDL receptor fluxes through
peripheral ARH-positive sites before delivery to early endosomes. Their
findings suggested that in ARH patients, defective sorting adaptor
function in hepatocytes leads to faulty LDL receptor traffic and
hypercholesterolemia.

To define the molecular mechanism underlying autosomal recessive
hypercholesterolemia, Wilund et al. (2002) examined ARH mRNA and protein
in fibroblasts and lymphocytes from 6 hypercholesterolemic patients with
different ARH mutations. Five probands were homozygous for mutations
that introduced premature termination codons; the sixth patient was
homozygous for a 2.6-kb insertion in intron 1 which was associated with
no detectable ARH mRNA. None of the probands had detectable full-length
ARH protein in fibroblasts or lymphoblasts. No relationship was apparent
between the site of the mutation in ARH and the amount of mRNA.
Radiolabeled LDL degradation was normal in ARH fibroblasts, but LDLR
function was markedly reduced in ARH lymphoblasts, despite a 2-fold
increase in LDL cell surface binding in these cells. Wilund et al.
(2002) concluded that ARH is required for normal LDLR function in
lymphocytes and hepatocytes, but not in fibroblasts, and that residual
LDLR function in cells that do not require ARH may explain why ARH
patients have lower plasma LDL levels than do patients with homozygous
familial hypercholesterolemia (144010) who have no functional LDLRs.

Al-Kateb et al. (2002) studied a Syrian family in which 3 sibs had
elevated LDL levels; 3 other sibs and both parents had normal LDL
levels, suggesting an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. A
genomewide scan using 427 markers showed support for linkage on both
chromosomes 1 and 13, with significant lod scores at 1p36.1-p35 and
13q22-q32 (see cholesterol-lowering factor, 604595). Al-Kateb et al.
(2002) found evidence for an interaction between these loci. They
identified an intron 1 acceptor splice site mutation in the ARH gene
(605747.0007) in homozygous state in the affected sibs and in
heterozygous state in the parents.

In 2 affected sibs from a nonconsanguineous Mexican family with
autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia, Canizales-Quinteros et al.
(2005) identified homozygosity for a donor splice site mutation in
intron 4 of the ARH gene (605747.0008).

ANIMAL MODEL

Jones et al. (2003) generated Arh-deficient mice and found that the
fractional clearance rate of radiolabeled Ldl in these mice was lower
than that in Ldlr -/- mice. By immunolocalization studies, they
demonstrated that Ldl receptors are sorted normally to the sinusoidal
surface in Arh -/- mouse livers. Jones et al. (2003) concluded that the
Ldl internalization defect in Arh-deficient mice is caused by the
inability of the receptors to enter the endocytic cycle.

Jones et al. (2007) examined the synthesis and catabolism of Vldl in
mouse models of autosomal dominant familial hypercholesterolemia (Ldlr
-/-) and ARH (Arh -/-). Despite similar rates of Vldl secretion in
response to a high-sucrose diet, the rate of Vldl clearance was
significantly higher in Arh-null mice than in Ldlr-null mice, suggesting
that LDLR-dependent uptake of VLDL is maintained in the absence of ARH.
Hepatocytes from Arh-null mice, but not Ldlr-null mice, internalized
beta-Vldl, demonstrating that ARH is not required for LDLR-dependent
uptake of VLDL by the liver. Jones et al. (2007) concluded that the
preservation of VLDL remnant clearance attenuates the phenotype of ARH
and likely contributes to greater responsiveness to statins in ARH
compared with FH.

generating an early stop codon at 657-659. The mother was heterozygous
for this mutation. Neither transcription product nor protein of ARH was
detected in the fibroblasts of the homozygous patients. Both sibs
exhibited fatty liver, which may also be related to this mutation.

606753	TITLE *606753 TETRATRICOPEPTIDE REPEAT DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 4; TTC4
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The 34-amino acid tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motif is found in a
variety of proteins and may mediate protein-protein or protein-membrane
interactions.

CLONING

By screening multiple cDNA libraries with ESTs from chromosome 1p31, a
region in which loss of heterozygosity has been frequently observed in
breast cancers, followed by 5-prime RACE, Su et al. (1999) obtained a
cDNA encoding TTC4. The deduced 356-amino acid protein has only limited
identity with TTC1 (601963) and TTC2 (601964), but all have coiled-coil
domains, and TTC4 has 4 TPR motifs. Northern blot analysis revealed wide
expression of a 2.0-kb TTC4 transcript, although levels were low in
lung.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hey et al. (2000) determined that the TTC4 gene contains 10 exons and
spans 28 kb.

MAPPING

Using FISH, Hey et al. (2000) mapped the TTC4 gene to chromosome 1p31.3,
excluding it as a target for loss in breast cancer. They identified a
TTC4 pseudogene, TTC4P, on 7p14-p13.

;;SMALL EDRK-RICH FACTOR 1; SERF1;;
SPINAL MUSCULAR ATROPHY-RELATED GENE H4F5; H4F5;;
SMA MODIFIER 1; SMAM1
DESCRIPTION Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) has been classified into 3 types based on
age of onset and severity. SMA I-III all map to 5q13, and nearly all
patients display deletions or gene conversions of the SMN1 gene
(600354). Although some correlation has been established between SMN
protein levels and disease course, the genetic basis for SMA phenotypic
variability is mainly unexplained, and it had been postulated that the
loss of an additional modifying factor contributes to the severity of
type I SMA. Scharf et al. (1998) found that a multicopy microsatellite
marker deleted in more than 90% of type I SMA chromosomes was embedded
in an intron of H4F5, indicating that this gene is also highly deleted
in type I SMA chromosomes, and thus is a candidate phenotypic modifier
for SMA. The microsatellite marker, designated C212, is located in the
last intron of H4F5, 5 kb upstream of H4F5 exon 3b and 13 kb upstream of
SMN exon 1. In 58 type I SMA patients of varied European and Arabian
descent, Scharf et al. (1998) found a reduction or absence of C212/H4F5
alleles in 94% of chromosomes, implying a deletion of 1 or both copies
of the marker and therefore of H4F5 exon 3b in these individuals. In
comparison with the high rate of C212/H4F5 deletions in type I SMA, the
C212 deletion frequency in type II SMA chromosomes was between that of
type I and control chromosomes, whereas deletions in type III
chromosomes were only slightly more frequent than in controls.

Scharf et al. (1998) sequenced a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)
containing the mouse Smn gene to identify conserved elements between the
human SMA interval and its previously identified syntenic region on
mouse chromosome 13 (Scharf et al., 1996). The resulting sequence was
filtered for repetitive elements and used to screen the EST database.
ESTs corresponding to SMN and NAIP were identified as well as 2 ESTs
representing novel genes within the BAC. One of these ESTs, clone
368449, mapped to 10.6 kb upstream of mouse Smn; subsequent analysis of
surrounding genomic sequences using 4 exon-prediction programs
identified no additional transcripts between 368449 and Smn or between
Smn and Naip. The full-length 566-bp mouse 368449 cDNA and its human
ortholog were cloned from a mouse brain and human skeletal muscle cDNA
library, respectively. The human clone was 99% homologous to exon 4F5,
an exon previously trapped from an SMA cosmid known to contain SMN exon
1. The full-length human cDNA was named H4F5, and its mouse counterpart
M4f5, until an appropriate function can be assigned to the 2 genes. The
proteins displayed 97% amino acid similarity to one another and both
genes were ubiquitously expressed with highest RNA levels in testis. In
addition, H4F5 has a larger 1.8-kb isoform, H4F5L, with a predicted
110-amino acid open reading frame that results from alternative splicing
of exon 3. In contrast to the 0.6-kb mouse and 0.7-kb human 4F5S
isoforms, the 1.8-kb H4F5L transcript is predominantly expressed in
heart, brain, and skeletal muscle. Both isoforms are also expressed
throughout the central nervous system, including spinal cord, which is
the tissue primarily affected in SMA. H4F5 was found to lie closer to
SMN1 than any previously identified gene in the region.

603872	TITLE *603872 TROPHININ-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN; TROAP
;;TROPHININ-ASSISTING PROTEIN;;
TASTIN
DESCRIPTION See trophinin (300132). One essential feature of implantation is the
formation of allogeneic and heterotypic cell-to-cell contacts between
embryonic and maternal cells. Fukuda et al. (1995) identified trophinin
and tastin (trophinin-assisting protein) as molecules that mediate the
cell adhesion between HT-H trophoblastic cells and SNG-M endometrial
adenocarcinoma cells. Proline residues make up 16% of the predicted
778-amino acid tastin protein. One region of the protein contains 4
tandem repeats and is rich in cysteines. In vitro translated tastin has
a molecular mass of 80 kD. Immunofluorescence studies with mammalian
cells expressing trophinin alone or in combination with tastin indicated
that tastin creates multivalent trophinin patches on the cell surface
that serve as potent adhesion sites. In both HT-H and SNG-M cells,
tastin localized as a diffuse cytoplasmic protein and in fibers,
suggesting that it associates with the cytoskeleton. Northern blot
analysis revealed that tastin is expressed as a major 3.2- and a minor
3.5-kb mRNA in HT-H and SNG-M cells. However, tastin did not appear to
be expressed in various other types of human cells, with the exception
of macrophages. Based on the expression pattern of tastin and trophinin
in vivo and the activity of the cloned proteins, Fukuda et al. (1995)
suggested that these proteins might mediate the adhesion of the
blastocyst to the endometrial epithelium at the time of implantation. By
immunohistochemistry of placenta from the sixth week of pregnancy,
Suzuki et al. (1999) found that tastin was exclusively localized to the
apical side of the syncytiotrophoblast.

;;D2HGD
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

D-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.99.-) converts
D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D-2-HG) to 2-ketoglutarate (Achouri et al., 2004).

CLONING

Achouri et al. (2004) isolated and characterized rat D2hgdh and by
database analysis identified human D2HGDH, which encodes a 521-amino
acid protein. Subcellular fractionation of rat livers indicated that rat
D2hgdh was present in the mitochondrial fraction. Assays of
D-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase in rat tissues indicated that this
enzyme is most active in liver and kidney but is also active in heart
and brain (Struys et al., 2005). Kranendijk et al. (2010) noted that the
D2HGDH protein contains 522 amino acids.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kranendijk et al. (2010) noted that the D2HGDH gene contains 10 exons
with a noncoding exon 1.

MAPPING

Kranendijk et al. (2010) noted that the D2HGDH gene maps to chromosome
2p25.3. Hartz (2010) mapped the D2HGDH gene to chromosome 2q37.3 based
on an alignment of the D2HGDH sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK027102) with
the genomic sequence (GRCh37).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

D-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria (600721) is a neurometabolic disorder
characterized by developmental delay, epilepsy, hypotonia, and
dysmorphic features. Struys et al. (2005) identified mutations in the
D2HGDH gene (609186.0001-609186.0003) in 2 unrelated patients with
severe D-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria.

In individuals from 2 unrelated families with mild forms of
D-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria, Struys et al. (2005) identified mutations
in the D2HGDH gene (609186.0004 and 609186.0005).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
D-2-@HYDROXYGLUTARIC ACIDURIA 1
D2HGDH, VAL444ALA

In a white Italian boy with D-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria (600721) born
to healthy first-cousin parents, Struys et al. (2005) found homozygosity
for a 1331T-to-C transition in exon 9 of the D2HGD gene that resulted in
a val444-to-ala (V444A) amino acid substitution. The patient exhibited
psychomotor retardation, episodes of vomiting, and tonic, tonic-clonic,
and myoclonic seizures that were not responsive to antiepileptic
treatment. He died at 2 years of age.

.0002
D-2-@HYDROXYGLUTARIC ACIDURIA 1
D2HGDH, ILE147SER

In a white American girl with D-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria (600721) born
to nonconsanguineous parents of mixed ancestry, described by Gibson et
al. (1993), Struys et al. (2005) found compound heterozygosity for
mutations in the D2HGD gene: a T-to-G transversion at nucleotide 440 in
exon 2 that resulted in an ile147-to-ser (I147S) substitution, and a
splice site mutation (609186.0003). Overexpression studies in HEK-293
cells of the mutant missense protein showed a marked reduction of
D-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase activity. The patient presented with
generalized tonic-clonic seizures, infantile spasms with hypsarrhythmia,
hypotonia, a movement disorder, cortical blindness, and developmental
delay.

.0003
D-2-@HYDROXYGLUTARIC ACIDURIA 1
D2HGDH, IVS1, A-G, -23

In a white American girl with D-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria (600721),
Struys et al. (2005) found compound heterozygosity for a splice site
mutation, IVS1-23A-G, and a missense mutation (609186.0002). The
IVS1-23A-G mutation created an alternative splice acceptor site located
19 nucleotides upstream of the wildtype splice acceptor site, causing an
insertion of 19 nucleotides into the mature mRNA and resulting in
frameshift and premature termination (cys100fsX9).

.0004
D-2-@HYDROXYGLUTARIC ACIDURIA 1
D2HGDH, IVS4, A-G, -2

In 2 asymptomatic sibs, born of consanguineous Palestinian parents, with
D-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria (600721), Struys et al. (2005) identified a
homozygous A-to-G transition at the -2 position of intron 4 of the D2HGD
gene, resulting in a splice site mutation. The sibs showed normal
development at ages 10 and 3 years, respectively. Both parents were
heterozygous for the mutation, and it was not identified in 210 control
chromosomes. Studies in cultured fibroblasts indicated that the mutant
mRNA was unstable.

.0005
D-2-@HYDROXYGLUTARIC ACIDURIA 1
D2HGDH, ASN439ASP

In a Palestinian child, born of consanguineous parents, with a mild form
of D-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria (600721), Struys et al. (2005)
identified a homozygous 1315A-G transition in the D2HGD gene, resulting
in an asn439-to-asp (N439D) substitution. Overexpression of the mutant
protein showed that the enzyme had approximately 13% residual activity.
Both parents were heterozygous for the mutation, and it was not
identified in 210 control chromosomes.

.0006
D-2-@HYDROXYGLUTARIC ACIDURIA 1
D2HGDH, 2-BP DUP, 326TC

In 2 monozygotic twin sisters with D-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria
(600721), Misra et al. (2005) identified compound heterozygosity for 2
mutations in the D2HGDH gene: a 2-bp duplication in exon 2 (326dupTC),
resulting in a frameshift and premature termination, and a 1123G-T
transversion in exon 7, resulting in an asp375-to-tyr (D375Y;
609186.0007) substitution. The girls were 4.5 years old, born of
nonconsanguineous African American parents, and had markedly different
phenotypes. The more severely affected girl had multiple congenital
anomalies, hypotonia, severe developmental delay, epileptic
encephalopathy, and cortical atrophy with periventricular leukomalacia.
In contrast, her sister had a normal neurocognitive and neuroradiologic
phenotype without congenital abnormalities. Both girls had similar
dysmorphic facies, with dolichocephaly, malar flattening, and broad
nasal root. Both also had a similar biochemical profiles. The discordant
phenotype indicated that epigenetic differences or environmental factors
must have influenced the phenotypic response to the biochemical defect,
rather than allelic heterogeneity.

102574	TITLE +102574 ACTININ, ALPHA-3; ACTN3
ACTN3 DEFICIENCY, INCLUDED;;
SPRINTING PERFORMANCE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Alpha-actinin is an actin-binding protein with multiple roles in
different cell types. In nonmuscle cells, the cytoskeletal isoform is
found along microfilament bundles and adherens-type junctions, where it
is involved in binding actin to the membrane (see ACTN1; 102575). In
contrast, skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle isoforms are localized to
the Z disc and analogous dense bodies, where they help anchor the
myofibrillar actin filaments. Beggs et al. (1992) characterized 2 human
muscle-specific alpha-actinin genes, ACTN2 (102573) and ACTN3. The
deduced 901-amino acid ACTN3 protein has a calculated molecular mass of
about 103 kD. ACTN3 has an N-terminal actin-binding domain of about 250
amino acids, followed by 4 central repeats and 2 EF-hand motifs near the
C terminus. Northern blot analysis of mouse tissues detected Actn3
expression in skeletal muscle, but not in heart, brain, liver, kidney,
or small intestine. ACTN3 was also detected in human fetal skeletal
muscle.

Seto et al. (2011) stated that the central repeats of ACTN3 are spectrin
(see 182860)-like repeats that form a rod domain.

MAPPING

Beggs et al. (1992) assigned the ACTN3 gene to human chromosome 11 by
use of somatic cell hybrids and narrowed the localization to chromosome
11q13-q14 by fluorescence in situ hybridization.

Mills et al. (2001) mapped the 4 murine actinin orthologs, which were
all located at evolutionarily conserved syntenic regions for the 4 human
genes.

GENE FUNCTION

Mills et al. (2001) demonstrated that murine Actn2 and Actn3 are
differentially expressed, spatially and temporally, during embryonic
development and that, in contrast to humans, alpha-actinin-2 expression
does not completely overlap alpha-actinin-3 in postnatal skeletal
muscle, suggesting independent function. Furthermore, sequence
comparison of human, mouse, and chicken alpha-actinin genes demonstrated
that ACTN3 has been conserved over a long period of evolutionary time,
implying a constraint on evolutionary rate imposed by continued function
of the gene.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

ACTN2 is expressed in all skeletal muscle fibers, whereas
alpha-actinin-3 expression is limited to a subset of type 2 (fast)
fibers. North et al. (1999) identified a common nonsense mutation in
ACTN3, arg577-to-ter (R577X; 102574.0001; dbSNP rs1815739), in the
general population in many ethnic groups. The R577X mutation had an
allele frequency ranging from 0.22 +/- 0.05 to 0.52 +/- 0.04 in ethnic
populations from Asia, the Americas, Australasia, Africa, and Europe.
Approximately 16% of the world population is predicted to have
congenital deficiency of alpha-actinin-3. No disease phenotype is
associated with this deficiency. North et al. (1999) concluded that
other factors likely compensate for the absence of alpha-actinin-3 at
the Z lines of skeletal muscle fast fibers. These results demonstrated
that ACTN3 is not an essential gene, and suggested that absence of a
structural protein caused by homozygosity for a null mutation cannot be
assumed to be disease-related without additional family and population
data.

Yang et al. (2003) demonstrated highly significant associations between
ACTN3 genotype and athletic performance. Both male and female elite
sprint athletes had significantly higher frequencies of the 577R allele
than did controls. This suggested that the presence of alpha-actinin-3
has a beneficial effect on the function of skeletal muscle in generating
forceful contractions at high velocity, and provides an evolutionary
advantage because of increased sprint performance. There is also a
genotype effect in female sprint and endurance athletes, with higher
than expected numbers of R577X heterozygotes among sprint athletes and
lower than expected numbers among endurance athletes. The lack of a
similar effect in males suggested that the ACTN3 genotype affects
athletic performance differently in males and females. The differential
effects in sprint and endurance athletes suggested that the R577X
polymorphism may have been maintained in the human population by
balancing natural selection. It is likely that there is a 'trade off'
between sprint and endurance traits that imposes important constraints
on the evolution of physical performance in humans and other vertebrates
(Garland et al., 1990). This hypothesis is supported by data from
world-class decathletes, which demonstrated that performance in the
100-meter sprint, shot put, long jump, and 110-meter hurdles (which rely
on explosive power and fast fatigue-susceptible muscle fibers) is
negatively correlated with performance in the 1,500-meter race (which
requires endurance and fatigue-resistant slow fiber activity) (Van Damme
et al., 2002).

ANIMAL MODEL

MacArthur et al. (2008) found that muscle from Actn3-knockout mice
displayed reduced force generation, reduced fast fiber diameter,
increased activity of multiple enzymes in the aerobic metabolic pathway,
altered contractile properties, and enhanced recovery from fatigue.
MacArthur et al. (2008) concluded that null mutation of ACTN3, such as
R577X, shifts the properties of fast fibers toward those characteristic
of slow fibers.

Quinlan et al. (2010) demonstrated a link between alpha-actinin-3 and
glycogen metabolism. Actn3 knockout mice had higher muscle glycogen
content and a 50% reduction in the activity of glycogen phosphorylase,
GPh (PYGM; 608455). The reduction in enzyme activity was accompanied by
altered posttranslational modification of GPh, suggesting that
alpha-actinin-3 may regulate GPh activity by altering its level of
phosphorylation. Quinlan et al. (2010) proposed that the changes in
glycogen metabolism underlie the downstream metabolic consequences of
alpha-actinin-3 deficiency.

Seto et al. (2011) found that, compared with wildtype, Actn3 -/- mouse
extensor digitorum longus muscle generated significantly reduced force
and was susceptible to contraction-induced damage during eccentric
contraction when stretched 30% above optimal length. Damage in Actn3 -/-
muscle was accompanied by upregulation of genes involved in muscle
regeneration. Expression of Actn2 was upregulated in Actn3 -/- muscle
such that the total sarcomeric content of alpha-actinin was unchanged.
The Z-disc proteins Zasp (LDB3; 605906), titin (TTN; 188840), and
vinculin (VCL; 193065) bound more avidly to Actn2 than to Actn3,
suggesting a biochemical basis for altered mechanics and fragility in
Actn3 -/- muscle.

ACTN3, ARG577TER (dbSNP rs1815739)

North et al. (1999) identified a C-to-T transition at nucleotide 1747
(dbSNP rs1815739) in exon 16 of the ACTN3 gene, which resulted in a stop
codon replacing the arg at residue 577 (R577X). This mutation resulted
in no protein detectable by Western blot. Sixteen percent of the world
population is predicted to be homozygous for this mutation. No disease
phenotype is associated; therefore, North et al. (1999) suggested that
the ACTN3 gene is functionally redundant in humans.

Mills et al. (2001) genotyped nonhuman primates and concluded that the
R577X null mutation most likely arose in humans.

Suminaga et al. (2000) found an allele frequency of 0.49 for the 1747C-T
polymorphism in Japanese. Although the incidence (24.2%) of congenital
deficiency of alpha-actinin-3 was high, no evidence could be found that
the homozygous state modified the dystrophinopathies Duchenne muscular
dystrophy (310200) and Becker muscular dystrophy (300376).

Yang et al. (2003) found that the R577X genotype is associated with
human elite athletic performance. Both male and female elite sprint
athletes had significantly higher frequencies of the 577R allele than
did controls. In female sprint and endurance athletes there was a higher
than expected number of R577X heterozygotes among sprint athletes and
lower than expected numbers among endurance athletes. The lack of a
similar effect in males suggested that the ACTN3 genotype affects
athletic performance differently in males and females. The differential
effects in sprint and endurance athletes suggested that the R577X
polymorphism may have been maintained in the human population by
balancing natural selection.

Niemi and Majamaa (2005) determined the ACTN3 R577X genotype in 52 elite
Finnish endurance and 89 sprint athletes and found that the frequency of
the XX genotype was higher and RR lower among the endurance athletes,
and that none of the top Finnish sprinters had the XX genotype.

The association of the R577X polymorphism with elite athlete status and
human muscle performance suggests that ACTN3 deficiency influences the
function of fast muscle fibers. MacArthur et al. (2007) showed that loss
of ACTN3 expression in a knockout mouse model resulted in a shift in
muscle metabolism toward the more efficient aerobic pathway and an
increase in intrinsic endurance performance. In addition, they
demonstrated that the genomic region surrounding the 577X null allele
shows low levels of genetic variation and recombination in individuals
of European and East Asian descent, consistent with strong, recent
positive selection. They proposed that the 577X allele has been
positively selected in some human populations owing to its effect on
skeletal muscle metabolism.

In a study of 992 Greek adolescent boys and girls, Moran et al. (2007)
found a significant association between the ACTN3 R577X polymorphism and
40 meter sprint times in males (p = 0.003) that accounts for 2.3% of
phenotypic variance, with the 577R allele contributing to faster times
in an additive fashion. The R577X polymorphism was not associated with
other predominantly strength/power-related or endurance phenotypes.

In 52 white and 23 black elite-level bodybuilders and powerlifters from
the U.S., Roth et al. (2008) found significantly lower XX genotype
frequency in strength athletes (6.7%) compared to controls (16.3%; p =
0.005). The XX genotype was significantly lower in white athletes (9.7%)
compared to white controls (19.9%; p = 0.018), but did not reach
significance in black athletes (0%) compared to black controls (4.8%; p
= 0.10). Roth et al. (2008) concluded that the 577X allele is
underrepresented in elite strength athletes in addition to sprint
athletes, consistent with previous reports indicating that ACTN3
deficiency appears to impair muscle performance.

;;SERS
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Vincent et al. (1997) assembled 2 overlapping clones of SARS, which they
called SERS, isolated from human fetal and infant brain cDNA libraries.
They obtained the full-length cDNA by 5-prime RACE of a brain cDNA
library. The deduced 514-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular
mass of about 59 kD. SARS has a 2-domain structure consisting of a
tRNA-binding domain and a catalytic domain, which contains the 3 motifs
shared by class II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. Motifs 2 and 3 share
sequence conservation between prokaryotic and eukaryotic seryl-tRNA
synthetases. SARS has no mitochondrial import signal sequence. Partial
Sars protein sequences from mouse and Chinese hamster share 94% and 92%
identity with human SARS.

Vincent et al. (1997) assayed bacterially expressed human SARS against
calf liver and E. coli tRNAs and found similar seryl-tRNA synthetase
activity against both substrates.

Using small interfering RNA, Herzog et al. (2009) found that depletion
of SARS from human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) increased
cell death, presumably due to loss of the function of SARS in protein
synthesis. However, prior to cell death, SARS depletion caused abnormal
tube formation and increased branching behavior of HUVECs in a rapid
network formation assay. Herzog et al. (2009) concluded that SARS
functions in angiogenesis, in addition to its role in protein synthesis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Vincent et al. (1997) determined that the SARS gene contains 11 exons
and spans more than 15 kb.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the SARS
gene to chromosome 1 (TMAP stSG9565).

ANIMAL MODEL

Independently, Fukui et al. (2009) and Herzog et al. (2009) identified
mutations in the zebrafish Sars gene that caused abnormal vascular
development. The function of Sars in vascular development was
independent of its canonical seryl-tRNA synthetase activity.

;;TRINUCLEOTIDE REPEAT-CONTAINING GENE 4; TNRC4;;
BRUNO-LIKE 1; BRUNOL1;;
CUGBP- AND ETR3-LIKE FACTOR 3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the CELF family, such as CELF3, play various roles in
cotranscriptional and posttranscriptional RNA processing. All CELF
proteins appear to affect pre-mRNA splicing, but individual CELFs have
divergent roles in regulating mRNA stability and translation (summary by
Wagnon et al., 2012).

CLONING

By searching databases for human sequences similar to Xenopus Brunol1,
Good et al. (2000) identified a partial sequence for TNRC4, which they
called BRUNOL1. The partial human protein shares 91% amino acid identity
with Xenopus Brunol1.

By searching EST databases for sequences similar to CUGBP (601074),
followed by PCR of a human brain cDNA library, Ladd et al. (2001) cloned
TNRC4, which they called CELF3. The deduced 462-amino acid protein
contains 2 N-terminal RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), a C-terminal RRM,
several potential phosphorylation sites, and a nuclear localization
signal near the C terminus. Ladd et al. (2001) also identified a region
of allelic variation in CELF3 in which a variable number of CAG repeats
encode a stretch of glutamines of unfixed length. RNA dot blot analysis
detected CELF3 expression only in brain.

Using RNA dot blot analysis, Ladd et al. (2004) found that CELF3 was
highly expressed in several adult brain regions, in pituitary, and in
fetal brain.

By Western blot analysis of adult human cortex, Chapple et al. (2007)
showed that the full-length 465-amino acid TNRC4 protein had an apparent
molecular mass of about 50 kD. Epitope-tagged TNRC4 was expressed in the
nucleus and cytoplasm of transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells.
Removal of RRM3 led to exclusion of TNRC4 from the nucleus, confirming
the presence of a C-terminal nuclear localization signal.

GENE FUNCTION

Ladd et al. (2001) showed that all human CELF proteins, including CELF3,
bound RNA containing muscle-specific splicing enhancer (MSE) elements
and could activate MSE-dependent exon inclusion of cardiac troponin T
(TNNT2; 191045) minigenes in transfected quail fibroblasts.

By RT-PCR analysis of transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells, Chapple
et al. (2007) showed that TNRC4 activated inclusion of exon 10 in a tau
(MAPT; 157140) minigene. Deletion and mutation analyses showed that the
activity of TNRC4 on tau exon 10 splicing required RRM2 in TNRC4 and an
intronic element in tau pre-mRNA. The polyglutamine sequence of TNRC4
had no effect on tau exon 10 splicing. Tnrc4 -/- mice exhibited
decreased inclusion of exon 10 in tau mRNA.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Good et al. (2000) mapped the TNRC4 gene
to chromosome 1q21.

179060	TITLE *179060 PYRUVATE DEHYDROGENASE, BETA POLYPEPTIDE; PDHB
;;PYRUVATE DEHYDROGENASE COMPLEX, E1 BETA POLYPEPTIDE; PHE1B
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Pyruvate decarboxylase is a tetramer consisting of 2 alpha subunits
(PDHA1; 300502) and 2 beta subunits. The enzyme, which is found in
mitochondria, is one of the component enzymes of the pyruvate
dehydrogenase multienzyme complex (PDH). It catalyzes the first reaction
of an oxidative decarboxylation sequence converting pyruvate to
acetyl-CoA and CO(2) (summary by Koike et al., 1988).

CLONING

Koike et al. (1988) cloned and sequenced cDNAs encoding the alpha and
the beta subunits.

Ho et al. (1988) isolated a 1.5-kb cDNA clone for the beta subunit of E1
from a human liver gamma-gt11 cDNA library using anti-E1 serum.

MAPPING

Using a cDNA probe, Olson et al. (1990) demonstrated that the PHE1B gene
is located on 3p13-q23.

GENE STRUCTURE

Koike et al. (1990) described the molecular cloning of the entire human
PHE1B gene, its characterization by restriction enzyme analysis, and its
complete nucleotide sequence. The PHE1B gene contains 10 exons. All
intron-exon splice junctions follow the GT/AG rule. The Alu family was
found in introns 2 and 8.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 2 unrelated patients with pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency (PDHBD;
614111), Brown et al. (2004) identified homozygous mutations in the PDHB
gene (179060.0001-179060.0002). The patients presented with lactic
acidosis and neurologic dysfunction and had little residual PDH activity
in cultured fibroblasts. The consequences of the mutations could be
analyzed by comparison with the normal structure of the human PDH E1
enzyme.

604726	TITLE *604726 SERINE/THREONINE PROTEIN KINASE 17A; STK17A
;;DAP KINASE-RELATED APOPTOSIS-INDUCING PROTEIN KINASE 1; DRAK1
DESCRIPTION Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is a highly regulated process that
is crucial in development. Deregulation of apoptosis is responsible for
a wide range of diseases such as autoimmune and neurodegenerative
disorders. By sequence homology searches using the catalytic domains of
2 serine/threonine kinases important in the regulation of apoptosis, DAP
kinase (600954) and ZIP kinase (603289), Sanjo et al. (1998) cloned 2
novel members of the ser/thr protein kinase family, which they termed
DRAK1 and DRAK2 (604727), but which were later designated STK17A and
STK17B, respectively. The full-length STK17A cDNA encodes a deduced
414-amino acid protein with a molecular mass of 46.56 kD. The putative
kinase domain is located at the N terminus and contains all 11
subdomains conserved among ser/thr kinases. STK17A and STK17B share
59.7% amino acid identity. Northern blot analysis revealed that STK17A
is expressed as a 1.9-kb transcript predominantly in placenta, but also
in heart, lung, skeletal muscle, kidney, and pancreas. An in vitro assay
demonstrated that STK17A is capable of autophosphorylation and of
phosphorylating myosin light chain as an exogenous substrate, and that
the noncatalytic C terminus is crucial for full kinase activity.
Immunofluorescence studies showed that both STK17A and STK17B are
localized in the nucleus. NIH 3T3 cells transfected with STK17A
expression plasmid displayed the morphologic changes typical of cells
undergoing apoptosis, but not when transfected with STK17A with an
inactivated kinase domain or a truncated noncatalytic C-terminal region.
A colony formation assay showed that the apoptosis-inducing activity of
STK17A requires the intact structure of the entire gene and that STK17A
and STK17B share similar levels of apoptosis-inducing activity.

;;N1/N2, XENOPUS, HOMOLOG OF
DESCRIPTION During mammalian spermatogenesis, testis-specific histones (see H1FT;
142712) and other testis- and sperm-specific proteins are expressed.
NASP (nuclear autoantigenic sperm protein) is a testis- and
sperm-specific histone-binding protein. O'Rand et al. (1992) cloned NASP
cDNA from a human testis cDNA library. The gene encodes a 787-amino acid
polypeptide with a predicted mass of 85 kD. The protein sequence is 53%
identical to that of the Xenopus ortholog, and 85% identical to that of
the rabbit ortholog when the N terminal of the rabbit sequence is
aligned with amino acid 101 of the human sequence. Two histone-binding
domains are strongly conserved. Northern blot analysis revealed a 3.2 kb
mRNA. Immunolocalization experiments demonstrated that in the testis,
NASP is found primarily in the cytoplasm of primary spermatocytes and
around or within the nuclei of spermatids. NASP is present near the
acrosomal region in mature human sperm.

615354	TITLE *615354 LIGAND-DEPENDENT NUCLEAR RECEPTOR-INTERACTING FACTOR 1; LRIF1
;;RECEPTOR-INTERACTING FACTOR 1; RIF1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

LRIF1 is a nuclear protein that represses ligand-dependent activation of
nuclear hormone receptors (Li et al., 2007).

CLONING

Using retinoic acid receptor-alpha (RARA; 180240) as bait in a yeast
2-hybrid screen of a human B cell cDNA library, followed by screening a
bone marrow cDNA library, Li et al. (2007) cloned LRIF1, which they
called RIF1. The deduced 739-amino acid protein contains a RARA-binding
domain, a transcriptional repression domain, and a C-terminal heptad
repeat predicted to form an amphipathic alpha-helical wheel, all in the
C-terminal portion. RIF1 also contains a predicted bipartite nuclear
localization signal. Northern blot analysis detected variable expression
of 3.5- and 1.8-kb RIF1 transcripts in all human tissues and cell lines
examined. In tissues, highest expression was detected in heart, liver,
and placenta. Epitope-tagged RIF1 was expressed in nuclei of transfected
HeLa cells, with exclusion from nucleoli.

GENE FUNCTION

Using protein pull-down assays, Li et al. (2007) found that RIF1
interacted with a number of human nuclear hormone receptors, including
ER-alpha (ESR1; 133430), GR-alpha (GCCR; 138040), TR-alpha (THRA;
190120), and PPAR-gamma (PPARG; 601487) and with mouse ROR-alpha (RORA;
600825), as well as with human RARA, but not with RXR (RXRA; 180245).
Addition of cognate hormones for these receptors did not alter their
interactions with RIF1. Overexpression of epitope-tagged RIF1 in MCF7
cells redistributed RARA from the cytosolic and chromatin fractions to
the nuclear matrix fraction. Full-length and the isolated C-terminal 100
amino acids of RIF1 showed strong transcriptional repression activity in
a dose-dependent manner, which depended upon recruitment of histone
deacetylase activity. Coexpression studies revealed that RIF1 inhibited
ligand-induced transcriptional activation of RARA in a dose-dependent
manner. Li et al. (2007) concluded that RIF1 functions as a
transcriptional repressor in part through recruitment of histone
deacetylases.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Li et al. (2007) mapped the LRIF1 gene to
chromosome 1p12.

604126	TITLE *604126 SUPERVILLIN; SVIL
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Supervillin is a 205-kD F-actin-binding protein originally isolated from
bovine neutrophils. This protein is tightly associated with both actin
filaments and plasma membranes, suggesting that it forms a link between
the actin cytoskeleton and the membrane.

CLONING

Pope et al. (1998) used PCR with primers based on bovine sequence to
clone human supervillin. The human gene encodes a 1,788-amino acid
polypeptide that contains 3 predicted nuclear localization signals,
several consensus phosphorylation sites, 1 ATP/GTP-binding motif, 1
potential RNP-binding site, and 3 potential actin-binding sites. The
region containing the actin-binding sites is similar to the 'headpiece'
of villin (193040). Dot blots showed that many tissues express
supervillin, with the highest expression in muscle tissues. Northern
blot analysis revealed a 7.5-kb mRNA that is abundant in some human
cancer cell lines. Southern blot analysis revealed that supervillin is a
single-copy gene.

Activation of androgen receptor (AR; 313700) via androgen in muscle
cells is closely linked to their growth and differentiation. Ting et al.
(2002) cloned and characterized supervillin as an AR coregulator from a
skeletal muscle cDNA library. They identified a domain within
supervillin (amino acids 594 to 1,268) that could interact with the AR N
terminus and DNA-binding domain-ligand-binding domain in a
ligand-enhanced manner. Subcellular colocalization studies with
fluorescence staining indicated that supervillin colocalized with AR in
the presence of 5-alpha-dihydrotestosterone in COS-1 cells. Furthermore,
supervillin could enhance expression of the endogenous AR target gene
p27(KIP1) (600778) in prostate cells. Thus, supervillin is an AR
coregulator that can enhance AR transactivation in muscle and other
cells.

MAPPING

Pope et al. (1998) used fluorescence in situ hybridization to map the
supervillin gene to chromosome 10p11.2

612137	TITLE *612137 RING FINGER PROTEIN 146; RNF146
;;DACTYLIDIN;;
IDUNA
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Von Rotz et al. (2005) cloned RNF146, which they called dactylidin after
the Greek word for ring, from a human brain cDNA library. The deduced
358-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 38.8 kD. It
contains an N-terminal C3HC4-type RING finger domain, 2 putative
myristoylation sites, and several putative phosphorylation sites.
Northern blot analysis detected a 2.5-kb transcript in all tissues
examined, with highest expression in heart and skeletal muscle. RNF146
mRNA showed similar abundance in all brain regions examined. Northern
blot analysis of mouse tissues detected highest Rnf146 expression in
heart and lower expression in all other tissues examined, including
skeletal muscle. In situ hybridization of mouse brain revealed
widespread expression of Rnf146 in the cytosol of neurons, but not in
glial cells. Epitope-tagged human RNF146 was detected in the cytosolic
fraction of transfected human glioblastoma cells. Database and Northern
blot analyses suggested that RNF146 may be alternatively spliced.

Andrabi et al. (2011) cloned mouse Rnf146, which they called Iduna after
the Norse goddess of protection and eternal youth. The deduced 359-amino
acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 39.8 kD. Iduna contains
an N-terminal RING finger domain and a central WWE domain that has a
poly(ADP-ribose)-binding site. Northern blot analysis detected Iduna
expression in mouse brain, spleen, heart, kidney, testis, and liver,
with 2 transcripts in testis. Western blot analysis detected variable
expression of an Iduna protein with an apparent molecular mass of 40 kD
in mouse brain regions.

GENE FUNCTION

Using quantitative PCR, von Rotz et al. (2005) found that RNF146 mRNA
was upregulated in the inferior temporal lobes of Alzheimer disease
(104300) patients compared with healthy controls.

Glutamate excitotoxicity is mediated largely through influx of calcium
through NMDA receptor (see 138249), leading to activation of PARP1
(173870) and generation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymer, a death signal that
kills cells via AIF (AIFM1; 300169). Andrabi et al. (2011) referred to
poly(ADP-ribose) polymer-induced cell death as parthanatos. Using
real-time PCR, Andrabi et al. (2011) found that Iduna expression
increased in mouse cortical neuronal cultures following exposure to a
sublethal dose of NMDA or oxygen-glucose deprivation. Iduna expression
also increased in mice following brief bilateral common carotid artery
occlusion. Increased Iduna expression protected cells and mice from
subsequent lethal challenge. Knockdown of Iduna expression in mouse
cortical neurons abolished the neuroprotective effect of sublethal NMDA
challenge. Overexpression of human Iduna was protective against
excitotoxic NMDA treatment in mouse cortical neurons in which Iduna
expression had been knocked down. Transient occlusion of the middle
cerebral artery in Iduna-overexpressing mice resulted in significantly
smaller infarct volume and improved neurologic function compared with
wildtype mice. Deletion and mutation analysis revealed that
neuroprotection against NMDA toxicity resulted from Iduna binding to
poly(ADP-ribose) polymer via critical tyrosine and arginine residues
within its central poly(ADP-ribose)-binding region. Andrabi et al.
(2011) concluded that Inuda antagonizes poly(ADP-ribose)
polymer-mediated cell death signaling.

GENE STRUCTURE

Von Rotz et al. (2005) determined that the RNF146 gene contains 5 exons.
Exon 5 contains the entire coding region.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, von Rotz et al. (2005) mapped the RNF146
gene to chromosome 6q22.1-q22.33.

;;ASPARTYL/ASPARAGINYL-BETA-HYDROXYLASE; HAAH;;
BAH
JUNCTIN, INCLUDED;;
JUNCTATE, INCLUDED;;
HUMBUG, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The ASPH gene encodes 3 proteins, ASPH, junctin, and junctate (or
humbug), that differ significantly in their C-terminal domains. Only
ASPH contains a C-terminal catalytic domain, which catalyzes the
posttranslational hydroxylation of aspartic acid or asparagine residues
within epidermal growth factor (EGF; 131530)-like domains of numerous
proteins (Dinchuk et al., 2002).

CLONING

Korioth et al. (1994) reported the cloning and characterization of the
human gene encoding aspartate beta-hydroxylase (ASPH; EC 1.14.11.16).
The enzyme recognizes a consensus peptide sequence and specifically
hydroxylates the beta carbon of aspartic acid or asparagine residues in
certain epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains of a number of
proteins. Among these are protein C (612283), coagulation factors VII
(613878), IX (300746), and X (613872), and the complement factors C1R
(613785) and C1S (120580). Korioth et al. (1994) selected a cDNA from an
osteosarcoma cDNA library by immunoscreening with an antiserum raised
against membrane fractions from these cells. The cDNA was shown to share
significant similarity with the bovine sequence. Two transcripts of 4.4
and 2.4 kb were seen with varying intensity in Northern blots of most
tissues. Based on Western blots, Korioth et al. (1994) also presented
evidence suggesting that posttranslational cleavage of the catalytic
carboxyl terminus occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum.

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC; 114550), one of the most prevalent
tumors in the world which occurs with especially high frequency in
sub-Saharan Africa and the Far East, a specific antigen is highly
expressed; it is highly expressed also in cholangiocarcinomas.
Lavaissiere et al. (1996) reported cDNA cloning of the human gene
encoding this antigen, aspartyl(asparaginyl)-beta-hydroxylase
(symbolized HAAH by them), and demonstrated that in these tumor lines it
is expressed in an enzymatically active form. The gene encodes a deduced
744-amino acid polypeptide with high homology (81%) to the bovine gene
(Jia et al., 1992). Lavaissiere et al. (1996) found that their cDNA
human sequence was 99% homologous to the sequence for ASPH reported by
Korioth et al. (1994), differing only at amino acid residues 565 (tyr to
ile), 575 (trp-trp-thr to cys-gly), 585 (asp to gln), and 709 (arg to
lys). They noted also a silent TCG-to-TCA transition at peptide residue
161. Lavaissiere et al. (1996) speculated about the possible
relationship of the malignant phenotype of regulated
aspartyl/asparaginyl-beta-hydroxylation in EGF-like domains of proteins
such as the mammalian Notch homologs (e.g., 190198, 600275, and 600276),
which are known to be involved in cell differentiation and whose
cytoplasmic domains have been shown to be oncogenic.

Junctin is a 26-kD transmembrane calsequestrin (CASQ; 114250)-binding
protein detected in junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) from cardiac
and striated muscle tissue. It also colocalizes with the ryanodine
receptor (RYR; 180901) and triadin (TRDN; 603283). Using a rabbit
junctin cDNA probe to screen a human heart muscle cDNA library, Wetzel
et al. (2000) isolated a cDNA encoding junctin. The deduced 225-amino
acid protein, which is 86% identical to the canine sequence, contains
charged residues adjacent to the 22-amino acid transmembrane domain,
suggesting that the N-terminal 24 residues face the cytoplasm with the
remainder in the SR lumen. Northern blot analysis detected a 2.8-kb
transcript in human cardiac muscle. An increase in junctin expression
was detected after birth in rabbit heart muscle.

By screening a heart cDNA library, followed by RT-PCR, Lim et al. (2000)
isolated cDNAs encoding the 225-amino acid junctin protein and a
210-amino acid isoform. The authors noted that a 73-residue stretch in
junctin has a completely matched region in the ASPH protein. Southern
blot analysis indicated that junctin and ASPH exist as a single-copy
gene. Northern blot analysis revealed expression of 3.0- and 4.2-kb
transcripts in cardiac and skeletal muscle; expression was higher in
skeletal muscle. SDS-PAGE analysis of the translated cDNAs showed
expression of 26- and 28-kD proteins.

By screening a skeletal muscle cDNA library with a dog junctin probe,
Treves et al. (2000) identified cDNAs encoding human junctin and
junctate. Sequence analysis predicted that junctate, a 299-amino acid
protein, shares the first 93 amino acids of the long isoform of junctin
(and, partially, of ASPH), whereas its 64 C-terminal residues are
identical to the central region of ASPH. Northern blot analysis detected
a 2.6-kb transcript in heart, brain, pancreas, placenta, lung, liver,
kidney, and skeletal muscle; highest levels were in heart, brain, and
pancreas, and lowest levels were in skeletal muscle. In contrast,
junctin was expressed only in cardiac and skeletal muscle. Southern blot
and PCR analyses indicated that ASPH, junctin, and junctate are splice
variants of the same gene; ASPH uses exons 1, 3, 5, and 8 through 16,
whereas junctin uses exons 2, 3, 5, and 6, and junctate uses exons 2
through 5 and 8 through 16. Fluorescence microscopy showed junctate
expression in sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum membranes. Immunoblot
analysis indicated that junctate is expressed as a 32-kD protein in
kidney microsomes. Binding analysis determined that junctate binds
calcium with high capacity and moderate affinity.

GENE STRUCTURE

Dinchuk et al. (2002) stated that the mouse Asph gene contains 24 exons
and spans more than 200 kb.

MAPPING

Using FISH, Treves et al. (2000) mapped the ASPH gene to chromosome
8q12.1.

ANIMAL MODEL

Dinchuk et al. (2002) disrupted the catalytic domain of Asph in mice
such that the coding regions of junctin and junctate remained
undisturbed. Asph-null mice displayed several developmental defects,
including syndactyly, facial dysmorphology, and a mild defect in hard
palate formation. The developmental defects were similar to those
observed in knockouts and hypomorphs of the Notch (see 190198) ligand
Serrate-2 (JAG2; 602570). Dinchuk et al. (2002) proposed that aspartyl
beta-hydroxylation of EGF domains can modulate Notch pathway signaling.
In addition, crossing Asph-null mice with mice carrying the Apc
(611731)-minimum mutation, which leads to the formation of multiple
intestinal polyps, resulted in a significant increase in region-specific
polyp size and frequency.

607562	TITLE *607562 INTERLEUKIN 23 RECEPTOR; IL23R
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

IL23 is a heterodimeric cytokine consisting of p19 (IL23A; 605580) and
p40 (IL12B; 161561) subunits. The p40 subunit also interacts with p35
(IL12A; 161560) to form IL12. IL23, like IL12, binds to IL12RB1
(601604), but only IL12 binds to IL12RB2 (601642). IL23R does not
interact with IL12, but pairs with IL12RB1 to confer IL23 responsiveness
on cells expressing both subunits (Parham et al., 2002).

CLONING

By PCR analysis of cDNA libraries of T-cell lines responding to IL23,
Parham et al. (2002) identified a 2.9-kb cDNA encoding IL23R. The
predicted 629-amino acid type I transmembrane protein, which shows some
homology to IL12RB2, contains a signal sequence, an N-terminal Ig-like
domain, 2 cytokine receptor domains, 7 potential N-linked glycosylation
sites, a WQPWS motif in the transmembrane domain, and a 252-residue
cytoplasmic domain with 6 conserved tyrosine residues and an additional
tyrosine at position 463 not found in mice. Northern blot analysis
revealed expression of an approximately 2.9-kb transcript in the Kit225
T-cell line, and quantitative real-time PCR analysis detected expression
in Th1, Th0, and NK cell lines, with little expression in monocytes,
dendritic cells, or B-cell lines.

By fragment size analysis of IL23R splice variants expressed in human
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), Yu and Gallagher (2010)
identified an IL23R splice variant that lacks exon 9. The variant, which
they called delta-9, represented 12 to 20% of total IL23R mRNA in PBMCs.
The deduced delta-9 protein contains 353 amino acids and has a
calculated molecular mass of 41 kD. It lacks the membrane anchor and
intracellular signaling domain of full-length IL23R, but it retains an
intact extracellular domain. Both full-length IL23R and the delta-9
variant were expressed equally inside transfected 293T cells, but unlike
full-length IL23R, delta-9 was also secreted. ELISA analysis showed that
delta-9 protein was generally present at low levels in human serum.
Western blot analysis and N-glycosidase treatment revealed that delta-9
was expressed as an N-glycosylated 65-kD protein.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Parham et al. (2002) determined that the
IL23R gene contains 10 exons spanning approximately 92 kb. Yu and
Gallagher (2010) stated that the IL23R gene contains 11 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Parham et al. (2002) mapped the IL23R gene
to chromosome 1p32.1-p31.2, within 150 kb of the IL12RB2 gene.

GENE FUNCTION

FACS analysis by Parham et al. (2002) readily detected binding of IL23,
but not IL12, to IL23R. Signal transduction analysis showed constitutive
association of IL23R with JAK2 (147796) and ligand-dependent association
with STAT3 (102582), as well as IL23-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation
of IL23R.

In mice, Buonocore et al. (2010) demonstrated that bacteria-driven
innate colitis is associated with an increased production of IL17
(IL17A; 603149) and interferon-gamma (147570) in the colon. Stimulation
of colonic leukocytes with IL23 induced the production of IL17 and
interferon-gamma exclusively by innate lymphoid cells expressing Thy1
(188230), stem cell antigen-1, retinoic acid-related orphan receptor
(Ror)-gamma-t; (RORC; 602943), and IL23R, and these cells markedly
accumulated in the inflamed colon. IL23-responsive innate intestinal
cells are also a feature of T cell-dependent models of colitis. The
transcription factor Ror-gamma-t, which controls IL23R expression, has a
functional role, because Rag (see 179615)-null/Rorc-null mice failed to
develop innate colitis. Last, depletion of Thy1+ innate lymphoid cells
completely abrogated acute and chronic innate colitis. Buonocore et al.
(2010) concluded their results identified a previously unrecognized
IL23-responsive innate lymphoid population that mediates intestinal
immune pathology and may therefore represent a target in inflammatory
bowel disease.

By flow cytometric and immunohistochemical analyses, Tonel et al. (2010)
demonstrated that expression of IL23 and IL23R was increased in the
tissues of patients with psoriasis (see 177900). Injection of a
neutralizing monoclonal antibody to IL23 in a xenotransplant mouse model
showed IL23-dependent inhibition of psoriasis comparable to results
obtained with anti-TNF (191160) blockers. Tonel et al. (2010) concluded
that the IL23 pathway has a critical role in the pathogenesis of
psoriasis.

Yu and Gallagher (2010) demonstrated that the IL23R delta-9 isoform
bound IL23, but not IL12, suggesting that it preferentially binds IL23
p19. Delta-9 formed a complex with IL23 and IL12RB1. In the presence of
delta-9, IL23-induced phosphorylation of STAT3 was inhibited and
maturation of Th17 cells to an active phenotype was reduced, as
indicated by diminished secretion of IL17A and IL17F (606496). Yu and
Gallagher (2010) concluded that IL23R delta-9 is a soluble form of the
receptor that represents a regulatory mechanism for Th17 cells.

Wu et al. (2013) used transcriptional profiling of developing T(H)17
cells to construct a model of their signaling network and nominate major
nodes that regulate T(H)17 development. Wu et al. (2013) identified
serum glucocorticoid kinase-1 (SGK1; 602958), a serine/threonine kinase,
as an essential node downstream of IL23 signaling. SGK1 is critical for
regulating IL23R expression and stabilizing the T(H)17 cell phenotype by
deactivation of mouse Foxo1 (136533), a direct repressor of IL23R
expression. SGK1 has been shown to govern sodium transport and salt
(NaCl) homeostasis in other cells. Wu et al. (2013) showed that a modest
increase in salt concentration induces SGK1 expression, promotes IL23R
expression, and enhances T(H)17 cell differentiation in vitro and in
vivo, accelerating the development of autoimmunity. Loss of SGK1
abrogated sodium-mediated T(H)17 differentiation in an IL23-dependent
manner. Wu et al. (2013) concluded that their data demonstrated that
SGK1 has a critical role in the induction of pathogenic T(H)17 cells and
provided a molecular insight into a mechanism by which an environmental
factor such as a high-salt diet triggers T(H)17 development and promotes
tissue inflammation.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Association with Inflammatory Bowel Disease 17

Duerr et al. (2006) performed a genomewide association study using
308,332 SNPs to investigate genetic factors contributing to Crohn
disease. The original study population comprised 547 non-Jewish European
ancestry patients with ileal Crohn disease and 548 non-Jewish controls.
Duerr et al. (2006) found a highly significant association between Crohn
disease and the IL23R gene (see IBD17, 612261), with an uncommon coding
variant, R381Q (607562.0001) conferring strong protection against Crohn
disease. Additional noncoding IL23R variants were independently
associated with Crohn disease. Duerr et al. (2006) then replicated the
association in an independent ileal Crohn disease cohort consisting of
401 patients and 433 controls, all of Jewish ancestry. Significant
associations were observed for several of the same markers that were
associated in the non-Jewish cohort. In a combined analysis of the data
from the 2 ileal Crohn disease case-control cohorts, 9 markers had
highly significant association P values ranging from 1.6 x 10(-9) to
3.36 x 10(-13). In family-based association testing of 27 IL23R region
markers in an independent cohort of 883 nuclear families, Duerr et al.
(2006) observed significant departure from random allele transmission to
affected offspring for R381Q and other IL23R markers in both Jewish and
non-Jewish families, providing further evidence for association between
Crohn disease and IL23R. The authors also observed distortion of allele
transmission to non-Jewish ulcerative colitis-affected offspring,
providing evidence for association of IL23R with non-Jewish ulcerative
colitis. There was no evidence for association of R381Q or other IL23R
region markers in the Jewish ulcerative colitis families. The glutamine
allele of R381Q is much less common than the arginine allele, with an
allele frequency of 1.9% in the non-Jewish patients with ileal Crohn
disease and 7% in non-Jewish controls. The glutamine allele appears to
protect against development of Crohn disease in both non-Jewish (OR,
0.26, 95% CI, 0.15-0.43) and Jewish (OR, 0.45, 95% CI, 0.27-0.73) case
control cohorts.

Libioulle et al. (2007) performed a genomewide association study with
more than 300,000 SNPs in 547 Caucasian patients with Crohn disease (CD)
from Belgium and 928 controls and found the strongest association (p
less than 10(-9)) with markers of the IL23R gene, including dbSNP
rs11209026, which corresponds to the R381Q substitution in IL23R. The
association with R381Q was replicated in 1,255 additional Caucasian CD
patients and 550 controls (combined p = 2.2 x 10 (-18)), and a
transmission disequilibrium test in 127
affected-offspring/unaffected-parent trios revealed significant
overtransmission of the associated alleles.

In an analysis of the IL23R region in CD patients from the Quebec
Founder Population and 2 independent German samples, Raelson et al.
(2007) found that the R381Q SNP did not occur consistently in all risk
and protective haplotypes, and concluded that it is highly unlikely that
R381Q fully explains the functional role of this gene in CD etiology.

In a genomewide association study involving DNA samples from 988
patients with ileal Crohn disease and 1,007 controls, Rioux et al.
(2007) found significant association with a SNP in the IL23R gene, dbSNP
rs7517847 (p = 3.06 x 10(-12)).

The Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (2007) described a joint
genomewide association study, using the Affymetrix GeneChip 500K Mapping
Array Set undertaken in the British population, which examined
approximately 2,000 individuals for each of 7 major diseases and a
shared set of approximately 3,000 controls. The association between
Crohn disease and SNPs within IL23R was represented by a cluster of
associated SNPs, including dbSNP rs11805303 (p = 6.5 x 10(-13)).

Glas et al. (2007) analyzed 10 IL23R variants, previously linked to CD
by Duerr et al. (2006), in a Caucasian German IBD cohort that included
patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) as well as CD patients. All of the
IL23R variants displayed highly significant associations with CD, and 8
of the 10 variants were also significantly associated with UC (see,
e.g., 607562.0001); the strongest association was found at dbSNP
rs1004819 (p = 1.92 x 10(-11) for CD). The odds ratios differentiating
between protection and susceptibility for UC were very similar to those
observed for CD, suggesting overall similar disease-modifying effects of
the different IL23R variants on CD and UC. Glas et al. (2007) found no
evidence for epistatic interaction between IL23R and CARD15 (605956),
SLC22A4 (604190), or SLC22A5 (603377).

In a study involving 1,841 ulcerative colitis cases and 1,470 controls,
Fisher et al. (2008) genotyped 16 SNPs tagging 13 CD-associated loci
identified by genomewide association studies and confirmed the
association between IL23R variants and UC (p = 1.3 x 10(-5) at dbSNP
rs11805303). Genotyping 5 additional IL23R SNPs refined the association,
and conditional regression analysis revealed that dbSNP rs11209026
(R381Q) provided the strongest signal (OR, 0.53; p = 8.0 x 10(-8)), with
evidence that additional independent variants also contribute to
ulcerative colitis risk.

Using high-throughput sequencing of DNA pools to search for rare coding
variants influencing susceptibility to Crohn disease, Momozawa et al.
(2011) identified 3 low-frequency coding variants in the IL23R gene
conferring protection against CD: arg86-to-gln (R86Q), gly149-to-arg
(G149R), and val362-to-ile (V362I), which were all found at higher
frequencies in controls than in CD patients. They replicated a
protective effect for the known R381Q variant (607562.0001). They also
presented preliminary evidence that 2 of the variants, G149R and V362I,
also act protectively against ulcerative colitis.

Rivas et al. (2011) used pooled next-generation sequencing to study 56
genes from regions associated with Crohn disease in 350 cases and 350
controls. Through follow-up genotyping of 70 rare and low-frequency
protein-altering variants in 9 independent case-control series (16,054
Crohn disease cases, 12,153 ulcerative colitis cases, and 17,575 healthy
controls), they identified 2 additional protective variants in IL23R:
G149R (p = 3.2 x 10(-4)) and V362I (p = 1.2 x 10(-5)). These findings
confirmed the findings of Momozawa et al. (2011) and indicated that each
of these variants has a protective effect equivalent to that of the more
common R381Q substitution, although they arose on different haplotype
backgrounds and are not in linkage disequilibrium with R381Q. Despite
the large follow-up sample size (n = 31,747), Rivas et al. (2011) did
not find evidence for a protective effect of the R86Q variant.

Using lipopolysaccharide-stimulated peripheral blood cells from 6
individuals heterozygous for a C-to-A SNP in the 3-prime UTR of IL23R
(dbSNP rs10889677) and a SNP-specific assay, Zwiers et al. (2012) showed
that the A allele produced significantly more IL23R mRNA than the C
allele. Western blot analysis showed that AA homozygous individuals also
produced significantly more IL23R protein than CC homozygous
individuals. Database analysis suggested that the SNP abolished binding
sites for the microRNAs (miRNAs) LET7E (MIRLET7E; 611250) and LET7F (see
MIRLET7F1; 612146). Luciferase analysis confirmed the in silico
prediction and demonstrated increased IL23R expression from the C
allele, but not the A allele, when a LET7E-specific inhibitor was used.
Likewise, transfection analysis showed that both LET7E and LET7F
interfered with upregulation of IL23R in CC cells, but not AA cells.
Zwiers et al. (2012) proposed that dbSNP rs10889677, which is associated
with susceptibility to IBD, affects the functionality of the IL23R gene
by altering miRNA regulation.

The Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium and the
Australo-Anglo-American Spondylitis Consortium (2007) found evidence
suggesting that IL23R may be a common susceptibility factor for the
major 'seronegative' diseases.

may be a susceptibility gene for leprosy.

Association with Inflammatory Bowel Disease

Using a large-scale genomewide association study, Duerr et al. (2006)
identified an uncommon coding mutation in the IL23R gene, a 1142G-A
transition, resulting in an arg381-to-glu (R381Q) substitution (dbSNP
rs11209026), that confers strong protection against Crohn disease (see
612261). This SNP was identified in 1 cohort and replicated in 2 others.
The gln381 allele was found in 7% of non-Jewish controls and 1.9% of
non-Jewish patients with ileal Crohn disease.

Libioulle et al. (2007) performed a genomewide association study with
more than 300,000 SNPs in 547 Caucasian patients with Crohn disease from
Belgium and 928 controls and found the strongest association (p less
than 10(-9)) with markers of the IL23R gene, including dbSNP rs11209026,
which corresponds to the R381Q substitution. The association with R381Q
was replicated in 1,255 additional Caucasian CD patients and 550
controls (combined p = 2.2 x 10(-18)).

Raelson et al. (2007) analyzed the IL23R region in 477 parent-proband
trios with Crohn disease from the Quebec Founder Population and 2
independent German samples involving 521 affected-child trios, 752
cases, and 828 independent controls. The authors found that the R381Q
SNP did not occur consistently in all risk and protective haplotypes,
and concluded that it is highly unlikely that R381Q fully explains the
functional role of this gene in CD etiology.

In a Caucasian German IBD cohort that included 833 CD patients, 456
patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), and 1,381 unrelated controls,
Glas et al. (2007) confirmed the association between dbSNP rs11209026
and protection against CD (OR, 0.43; p = 8.04 x 10(-8)) and also found a
significant association with protection from UC (OR, 0.70; p = 0.00361).

In a study involving 1,841 ulcerative colitis cases and 1,470 controls,
Fisher et al. (2008) found the strongest signal at dbSNP rs11209026 (p =
8.0 x 10(-8); OR, 0.53), with evidence that additional independent IL23R
variants also contribute to ulcerative colitis risk.

McGovern et al. (2010) combined new data from 2 genomewide association
studies of ulcerative colitis involving 266,047 SNPs and performed a
metaanalysis with previously published data (Silverberg et al., 2009),
thus bringing together a discovery set of 2,693 European UC patients and
6,791 controls; the top results from the metaanalysis were then
independently replicated with 2,009 additional European UC cases and
1,580 controls. McGovern et al. (2010) confirmed association with UC at
dbSNP rs11209026 (combined p = 1.9 x 10(-13)).

Association with Psoriasis

Capon et al. (2007) reported a significant association between the R381Q
variant and protection against psoriasis (PSORS7; 605606) among 318
British patients with the disorder. The findings were replicated in a
second group of 519 British patients. Together, the association yielded
an odds ratio of 0.49 (p = 0.00014), with the gln381 allele offering
protection from the disease. Capon et al. (2007) noted that the arg381
residue is highly conserved among higher vertebrates and is located
within the binding domain for JAK2 kinase, which is the first mediator
of the IL23R signaling cascade (Parham et al., 2002).

610480	TITLE *610480 LEM DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1; LEMD1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By microarray analysis to identify genes upregulated in colorectal
carcinomas, followed by database analysis, Yuki et al. (2004) identified
LEMD1. Northern blot analysis detected a 0.7-kb LEMD1 transcript
expressed in testis only. RT-PCR revealed 6 alternatively spliced LEMD1
transcripts in testis. The longest deduced protein, LEMD1A, contains 181
amino acids and has an N-terminal LEM domain. Of the 6 LEMD1 variants,
LEMD1B, which encodes a deduced 29-amino acid protein lacking the LEM
domain, showed highest expression in testis. LEMD1F, which encodes a
67-amino acid protein containing the N-terminal LEM domain, was detected
in 17 of 18 colon cancer tissues examined. Epitope-tagged LEMD1F was
expressed in transfected COS-7 cells at the nuclear membrane and
colocalized with transfected BAF (BANF1; 603811).

GENE STRUCTURE

Yuki et al. (2004) determined that the LEMD1 gene contains 6 exons.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the LEMD1
gene to chromosome 1 (TMAP RH92566).

;;SPECKLED, 140-KD;;
LYMPHOID-RESTRICTED SP100 HOMOLOG; LYSP100
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By subtractive hybridization for cDNAs enriched in a Raji Burkitt
lymphoma (113970) cell line cDNA library, followed by screening Raji and
HeLa cell cDNA libraries, Dent et al. (1996) cloned splice variants of
SP140, which they designated LYSP100A and LYSP100B. LYSP100A encodes a
deduced 412-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 46
kD, and LYSP100B encodes a deduced 882-amino acid protein with a
calculated molecular mass of 100 kD. The N-terminal 353 amino acids of
LYSP100A and LYSP100B are identical, and the N-terminal 158 amino acids
of both proteins share 61% amino acid homology with the N-terminal
region of SP100 (604585). LYSP100B has a C-terminal PHD domain and a
bromodomain. Northern blot analysis detected transcripts of 0.9, 1.6,
and 3.0 kb in spleen, thymus, and tonsil, but not in brain, liver, and
muscle. LYSP100 expression was detected in all mature B-lymphocyte and
plasma cell lines tested, as well as in some T-lymphocyte cell lines,
but not in nonlymphoid cell lines. Western blot analysis detected
LYSP100 isoforms ranging in size from 65 to 150 kD. Using confocal
microscopy and electron microscopy, Dent et al. (1996) localized LYSP100
to subnuclear structures morphologically and spatially distinct from
nuclear bodies containing PML (102578).

By screening a hepatocarcinoma cDNA expression library using
autoantibodies in serum from a patient with primary biliary cirrhosis
(PBC; 109720), followed by screening hepatocarcinoma and umbilical vein
endothelial cell cDNA libraries, Bloch et al. (1996) cloned SP140. The
deduced protein contains 753 amino acids. The N terminus of SP140,
between amino acids 29 and 157, is 49% identical to a corresponding
N-terminal region of SP100. The C terminus of SP140 contains a
cysteine-rich zinc finger motif and a bromodomain. SP140 also has a
central nuclear localization signal. RNA dot blot analysis detected high
SP140 expression in spleen and peripheral blood leukocytes, with much
lower levels in thymus, prostate, ovary, small intestine, and colon;
other tissues showed little to no expression. Low expression of a
smaller transcript was also observed. Western blot analysis with PBC
autoantibodies detected SP140 at an apparent molecular mass of 140 kD
following in vitro transcription and translation. Immunohistochemistry
demonstrated that SP140 colocalized with PML in dense nuclear bodies in
activated myeloid precursor cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Bloch et al. (1996) found that expression of SP140 increased in myeloid
precursor cell lines following activation with phorbol ester, dimethyl
sulfoxide, or all-trans retinoic acid. Expression was also enhanced by
treatment of cells with gamma-interferon (147570).

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the SP140
gene to chromosome 2 (TMAP SHGC-34902).

602435	TITLE *602435 PEPTIDYL-PROLYL ISOMERASE E; PPIE
;;CYCLOPHILIN, 33-KD; CYP33;;
CYCLOPHILIN E
DESCRIPTION The cyclophilins (CYPs) are a conserved family of peptidyl-prolyl
cis-trans isomerases (PPIases; see 123840) that bind the
immunosuppressant cyclosporin A (CsA).

CLONING

Mi et al. (1996) used degenerate PCR to identify the sequences of novel
cyclophilins expressed in Jurkat T cells. They subsequently cloned a
novel cDNA whose sequence encodes a 301-amino acid polypeptide of
molecular mass 33 kD, termed CYP33 by them. Sequence analysis revealed
that the encoded protein contains an N-terminal RNA-binding domain and a
C-terminal CYP domain. Expression studies showed that the CYP33 protein
exhibits RNA-binding activity, PPIase activity, and protein folding
activity. The PPIase activity of CYP33 is inhibited by CsA with kinetics
similar to other CYPs. Northern blotting of T-cell mRNA revealed
expression of a low abundance 1.6-kb CYP33 transcript. Mi et al. (1996)
stated that CYP33 is the first example of a protein that combines
RNA-binding and PPIase activities.

While characterizing aberrant LMYC (164850) transcripts in a small cell
lung cancer (SCLC) cell line, Kim et al. (1998) detected a novel
transcript. By searching an EST database, they determined that the novel
sequence had greatest identity with PPIases. Using the 5-prime end of
the sequence, which they called PPIE, as a probe to screen a human
skeletal muscle cDNA library, they obtained a cDNA encoding a 301-amino
acid protein that is identical to CYP33. Northern blot analysis revealed
expression of a major 1.4-kb transcript in some but not all SCLC lines.

MAPPING

By Southern blot and somatic cell hybrid analysis, Kim et al. (1998)
mapped the PPIE gene to an 800-kb fragment of chromosome 1p32 between
LMYC (164850) and RLF (180610).

606439	TITLE *606439 ATLASTIN GTPase 1; ATL1
;;ATLASTIN;;
SPG3A GENE; SPG3A
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The ATL1 gene encodes atlastin-1, a dynamin-related GTPase, which plays
a role in formation of the tubular endoplasmic reticulum (ER) network
and in axon elongation in neurons (Zhu et al., 2006; Orso et al., 2009).

CLONING

By positional cloning, Zhao et al. (2001) demonstrated that a form of
autosomal dominant hereditary spastic paraplegia with early onset
(SPG3A; 182600), before the age of 10 years and usually before the age
of 5, is caused by mutation in a GTPase gene. The gene was found to have
no homology to genes that cause other forms of hereditary spastic
paraplegia. It does show significant homology to guanylate binding
protein-1 (GBP1; 600411), a member of the dynamin family of large
GTPases. Northern blot analysis of ATL1 expression detected a 2.2-kb
transcript primarily in adult and fetal brain. RT-PCR experiments
indicated measurable expression in all tissues examined, although
expression in adult brain was at least 50-fold higher than in other
tissues. Translation of the 2.2-kb cDNA sequence of ATL1 yielded a
peptide of 558 amino acids.

By PCR of a cerebral cortex cDNA library, Zhu et al. (2003) cloned ATL1,
which they called atlastin-1. The deduced 558-amino acid protein
contains GTP-binding motifs in its N-terminal half and 2 transmembrane
domains in its C-terminal half. It also has 3 potential N-glycosylation
sites. Western blot analysis of transfected COS-7 cells detected
atlastin-1 at an apparent molecular mass of about 64 kD. Western blot
analysis detected high atlastin-1 expression in human and rat brain
homogenates, with much lower expression in several other human tissues,
including smooth muscle, adrenal gland, kidney, testis, and lung.
Immunohistochemical analysis of rat brain sections detected high
expression of atlastin-1 in cortical neurons of lamina V, pyramidal
neurons in CA1 and CA3 of the hippocampus, and in amygdala and several
thalamic nuclei. Staining was most prominent in the cell soma, with
weaker staining of axons and dendrites. Immunogold labeling detected rat
atlastin-1 predominantly in the cis-Golgi cisternae. Protease protection
assays indicated that the N and C termini of human atlastin-1 were
exposed to the cytoplasmic face of the membrane in transfected cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a yeast 2-hybrid assay, Zhu et al. (2003) determined that
atlastin-1 self-associates. Chemical cross-linking experiments indicated
that atlastin-1 most likely forms a homotetramer of about 230 kD. Zhu et
al. (2003) demonstrated that atlastin-1 has GTPase activity.

Independently, Evans et al. (2006) and Sanderson et al. (2006)
demonstrated that the N-terminal domain of spastin (SPAST; 604277) bound
directly to the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of atlastin, suggesting
that the 2 gene products interact in a common biologic pathway. Evans et
al. (2006) used yeast 2-hybrid analysis and coimmunoprecipitation
studies in HeLa cells, and Sanderson et al. (2006) used yeast 2-hybrid
analysis of a human fetal brain cDNA library and protein pull-down,
coimmunoprecipitation, and colocalization studies in HeLa cells, HEK293T
cells, and mouse NSC34 neuronal cells.

In the developing rat brain, Zhu et al. (2006) found that atlastin-1 was
expressed not only in the Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum, but
was also enriched in axonal growth cones and growth cone-like
varicosities along the axons. Atlastin-1 labeling was prominent on
vesicular structures within the growth cones, but not at the plasma
membrane and not at synapses. Knockdown of atlastin-1 using shRNA in
cultured cortical cells inhibited axonal growth. Overall, the findings
suggested that atlastin-1 has diverse functions in neurons, likely
acting both in intracellular membrane trafficking as well as in
expansion at the axonal growth cone. These functional studies suggested
that the early-onset axonopathy observed in SPG3A may result from
abnormal development of axons.

Orso et al. (2009) demonstrated that Drosophila atlastin localizes on
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes and that its loss causes ER
fragmentation. Drosophila atlastin embedded in distinct membranes has
the ability to form trans-oligomeric complexes, and its overexpression
induces enlargement of ER profiles, consistent with excessive fusion of
ER membranes. In vitro experiments confirmed that atlastin autonomously
drives membrane fusion in a GTP-dependent fashion. In contrast,
GTPase-deficient atlastin is inactive, unable to form trans-oligomeric
complexes owing to failure to self-associate, and incapable of promoting
fusion in vitro. The results of Orso et al. (2009) demonstrated that
atlastin mediates membrane tethering and fusion and strongly suggested
that it is the GTPase activity required for ER homotypic fusion.

GENE STRUCTURE

Zhao et al. (2001) found that the ATL1 gene contains 14 exons and spans
approximately 69 kb.

MAPPING

Zhao et al. (2001) determined that the ATL1 gene maps to chromosome
14q11-q21. Zhu et al. (2003) stated that the ATL1 gene maps to
chromosome 14q22.1.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Spastic Paraplegia 3A

Zhao et al. (2001) identified mutations in the ATL1 gene (see, e.g.,
606439.0001) in families with spastic paraplegia-3A (SPG3A; 182600) in
which linkage to 14q11-q21 had been demonstrated as well as in other
phenotypically similar families without linkage evidence.

Durr et al. (2004) identified mutations in the ATL1 gene in 12 (39%) of
31 families with early-onset autosomal dominant spastic paraplegia. One
family showed incomplete penetrance.

Namekawa et al. (2006) stated that 19 mutations in the ATL1 gene had
been identified in 40 different families. More than 90% of the mutations
were located in exons 4 (12.5%), 7 (27.5%), 8 (17.5%), and 12 (35%).

In COS-7 cells, Zhu et al. (2006) showed that disease-associated
missense mutations in the ATL1 gene were expressed and interacted
strongly with wildtype ATL1, causing a decrease in GTPase activity in a
dominant-negative manner. The GTPase impairment was strongest with the
R217Q mutation (606439.0004), which is located within the GTPase binding
site, but was also observed with other missense mutations (R239C;
606439.0001 and H258R; 606439.0003), suggesting that these regions may
modulate activity.

Beetz et al. (2007) reported a family in which spastic paraplegia
segregated with a deletion of exon 1 of the SPAST gene (604277) in the
proband, her brother, and her 2 sons. Although the proband and her
brother also had a deletion of the ATL1 gene, the ATL1 deletion did not
segregate with the disorder in her sons and had no apparent effect on
the severity of the disorder. The findings suggested that
haploinsufficiency is the pathogenic mechanism for SPG4 (182601),
whereas a dominant-negative effect is the pathogenic mechanism for
SPG3A.

- Hereditary Sensory Neuropathy Type 1D

By genomewide linkage analysis followed by array-based exonic sequencing
of candidate genes, Guelly et al. (2011) identified a heterozygous
mutation in the ATL1 gene (N355K; 606439.0010) as a cause of autosomal
dominant hereditary neuropathy type 1D (HSN1D; 613708) in an affected
family. Screening of this gene in 115 additional probands with a similar
disorder identified 2 additional heterozygous mutations in the ATL1 gene
in 2 unrelated probands (606439.0011 and 606439.0012, respectively). The
phenotype was characterized by adult onset of a distal axonal sensory
neuropathy affecting all modalities, often associated with distal
ulceration and amputation as well as hyporeflexia, although some
patients showed features suggesting upper neuron involvement. In vitro
functional expression studies in COS7 cells did not reveal a common
pathogenetic mechanism, and there was no clear functional distinction
between mutations causing SPG3A and HSN1D, but Guelly et al. (2011)
postulated that a defect in the tubular endoplasmic reticulum may
underlie both disorders.

ATL1, ARG239CYS

In affected members of 3 apparently unrelated kindreds with spastic
paraplegia-3 (182600), Zhao et al. (2001) identified a heterozygous
884C-T transition in exon 7 of the ATL1 gene, resulting in an
arg239-to-cys (R239C) substitution.

Abel et al. (2004) identified the R239C mutation in all 22 affected
members of a French family with SPG3 reported by Hazan et al. (1993).
Abel et al. (2004) stated that this was the seventh SPG3 family of
western European descent found to have the R239C mutation. Abel et al.
(2004) reported the nucleotide change as 715C-T, based on numbering from
the translation initiation codon, and noted that position 715 is within
a CpG doublet, suggesting that it is a possible mutation hotspot.

By haplotype analysis of 3 French families with the R239C mutation,
Namekawa et al. (2006) concluded that the mutations arose independently
and were not due to a founder effect. Further analysis confirmed that
the mutation occurred in a hotspot defined by a methylated CpG
dinucleotide.

SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA 3, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
ATL1, SER259TYR

In a kindred designated ADHSP-P with early-onset autosomal dominant
spastic paraplegia (182600), Zhao et al. (2001) identified
heterozygosity (both C and A) at nucleotide 945 of the full-length ATL1
cDNA, corresponding to exon 8 of the gene. Unaffected members of the
family had only C at this position. This mutation, TCC (ser) to TAC
(tyr), was predicted to alter amino acid 259. Thus, this mutation,
S259Y, is adjacent to the H258R mutation (606439.0003).

.0003
SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA 3, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
ATL1, HIS258ARG

Zhao et al. (2001) found that affected members in a kindred with
autosomal dominant hereditary spastic paraplegia of early onset (182600)
were heterozygous (A and G) at nucleotide position 942 of the
full-length cDNA corresponding to the ATL1 gene. Affected members in
this kindred had only C at this position. The mutation was predicted to
result in a his258-to-arg (H258R) amino acid substitution, at a site
adjacent to S259Y (606439.0002).

.0004
SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA 3, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
ATL1, ARG217GLN

In a large Italian family with early-onset, autosomal dominant
uncomplicated spastic paraplegia (182600), Muglia et al. (2002)
identified an 818G-A mutation in the ATL1 gene, resulting in an
arg217-to-gln substitution in a highly conserved GTPase motif.

.0005
SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA 3, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
ATL1, 1-BP INS, 1688A

In an Italian family with autosomal dominant hereditary spastic
paraplegia (182600), Tessa et al. (2002) identified a heterozygous 1-bp
insertion, 1688A, in exon 12 of the ATL1 gene, producing a frameshift
and premature stop codon. The resulting protein lacked the last 37 amino
acids, including all of exon 14. Seven clearly affected individuals and
2 asymptomatic individuals with hyperreflexia carried the mutation. The
authors commented on the apparent age-dependent penetrance of the
disorder in this family.

.0006
SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA 3, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
ATL1, MET408VAL

In a family with 6 members affected with a very early onset severe form
of spastic paraplegia (182600), Dalpozzo et al. (2003) identified a
heterozygous 1222A-G transition in exon 12 of the ATL1 gene, resulting
in a met408-to-val (M408V) substitution. All affected members had onset
in infancy with delayed motor milestones, gait impairment, spastic
paraparesis, distal atrophy, and lower limb weakness. Because of the
very early onset, the first patients were misdiagnosed with cerebral
palsy, and the index patient (mother of 5 affected members) was unaware
that she had a genetically transmissible disease. Two patients had the
unusual sign of mild hand atrophy.

.0007
SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA 3, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
ATL1, ARG415TRP

In all 3 affected members tested from an Italian family with SPG3A
(182600), D'Amico et al. (2004) identified a heterozygous mutation in
exon 12 of the atlastin gene, resulting in an arg415-to-trp (R415W)
substitution. The mutation was not identified in 400 control
chromosomes. The 3 patients had onset before 5 years of age, and 2
additional family members were reportedly affected by infantile-onset
spastic paraparesis. However, 9 asymptomatic relatives ranging in age
from 13 to 70 years also had the mutation. D'Amico et al. (2004)
concluded that the reduced penetrance of this mutation indicated that
modulator genes or epigenetic factors are involved in the development of
the disease, and they noted the implications for genetic counseling.

Varga et al. (2013) identified a heterozygous c.1243C-T transition in
the ATL1 gene resulting in an R415W substitution in affected members of
a family with SPG3A originally reported by Raggio et al. (1973) as
having a pure spastic paraplegia transmitted in an X-linked pattern of
inheritance. Whole-exome sequencing of 1 of the affected males
identified the heterozygous R415W substitution. This mutation was then
identified in 3 affected family members and in 3 unaffected family
members, consistent with incomplete penetrance. Two of the unaffected
carriers were women, and family history indicated that most unaffected
women were obligate carriers. These findings were consistent with
sex-associated reduced penetrance of this mutation. Varga et al. (2013)
identified the same mutation in 1 of 83 Spanish patients with apparent
sporadic HSP and in 2 of 28 Russian patients with dominant HSP. Evidence
again suggested incomplete penetrance in these families. Varga et al.
(2013) also identified a heterozygous c.1244A-G transition, resulting in
an arg415-to-gln (R415Q; 606439.0014) substitution, in a Moroccan family
with SPG3A and incomplete penetrance. Varga et al. (2013) noted that
both the c.1243C-T and c.1244A-G transitions occur at a CpG nucleotide
(on the plus and minus strands, respectively) and thus may represent a
mutation hotspot due to spontaneous deamination of methylated cytosines.
R415 affects a highly conserved residue that does not localize to a
known protein domain.

.0008
SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA 3, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
ATL1, LEU157TRP

In a mother and son with SPG3A (182600), Rainier et al. (2006)
identified a heterozygous 638T-C transition in exon 4 of the ATL1 gene,
resulting in a leu157-to-trp (L157W) substitution. The mutation is
predicted to disrupt a putative phosphorylation site of the protein.
Genetic analysis of family members indicated that the mutation occurred
de novo in the mother. The mother was a 34-year-old woman with
uncomplicated nonprogressive spastic paraplegia since infancy who was
originally diagnosed with spastic diplegic cerebral palsy. She was
correctly diagnosed with SPG after her son developed similar clinical
symptoms at age 10 months.

.0009
SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA 3, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
ATL1, 3-BP DEL

In affected members of a large French Canadian family with SPG3A
(182600), Meijer et al. (2007) identified a heterozygous 3-bp in-frame
deletion in the ATL1 gene, resulting in a deletion of asn436 (436delN).
Functional expression studies showed decreased ATL1 protein levels in
patients' lymphoblasts but normal levels of mRNA, normal GTPase
activity, and normal protein interactions. Meijer et al. (2007)
postulated decreased protein stability and a dominant-negative
loss-of-function mechanism.

.0010
NEUROPATHY, HEREDITARY SENSORY, TYPE ID
ATL1, ASN355LYS

In affected members of a large 4-generation family with autosomal
dominant hereditary sensory neuropathy type ID (HSN1D; 613708), Guelly
et al. (2011) identified a heterozygous 1065C-A transversion in exon 11
of the ATL1 gene, resulting in an asn355-to-lys (N355K) substitution.
The mutation was not found in 370 controls. The phenotype was
characterized by early adult onset of a severe distal st sensory axonal
neuropathy with frequent ulcerations and amputation digits. In vitro
functional expression studies in COS7 cells showed that the mutant
protein had decreased GTPase activity compared to wildtype, and caused
disruption of endoplasmic reticulum 3-way junctions.

.0011
NEUROPATHY, HEREDITARY SENSORY, TYPE ID
ATL1, GLU66GLN

In a 61-year-old man with hereditary sensory neuropathy-1D (HSN1D;
613708), Guelly et al. (2011) identified a heterozygous 196G-C
transversion in exon 2 of the ATL1 gene, resulting in a glu66-to-gln
(E66Q) substitution. He presented with progressive, ascending, severe
sensory loss affecting all modalities in the lower legs, but no foot
ulcerations or paresis. He had hyporeflexia, and sural nerve biopsy
revealed a severe, chronic, axonal neuropathy with a moderate
demyelinating component. The patient's deceased mother reportedly had a
similar severe sensory neuropathy. The mutation was not found in 150
control individuals, but in vitro functional expression studies showed
no change in GTPase activity and no changes in endoplasmic reticulum
morphology.

.0012
NEUROPATHY, HEREDITARY SENSORY, TYPE ID
ATL1, 1-BP DEL, 976G

In a man with hereditary sensory neuropathy-1D (HSN1D; 613708), Guelly
et al. (2011) identified a heterozygous 1-bp deletion (976delG) in exon
9 of the ATL1 gene, resulting in premature termination in the C
terminus. The patient had adult-onset sensory neuropathy with
ulcerations, lack of pain perception, paresthesias in the fingers, and
occasional lancinating pains in his ankles. Patellar tendon reflexes
were brisk, and Achilles tendon reflexes were absent. His father and
brother were similarly affected. The mutation was not found in 334
control individuals. In vitro functional expression studies showed
decreased expression of the truncated protein and diffuse localization
throughout the cytoplasm instead of proper localization to the
endoplasmic reticulum.

.0013
SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA 3, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
ATL1, ARG416CYS

In affected members of a 3-generation South African Zulu family with
autosomal dominant SPG3A (182600), Orlacchio et al. (2011) identified a
heterozygous 1246C-T transition in exon 12 of the ATL1 gene, resulting
in an arg416-to-cys (R416C) substitution. The mutation was not found in
400 controls. The phenotype in this family was unusual in that affected
individuals had late onset (range 38 to 56 years), mild mental
retardation (IQ 32 to 67), and thin corpus callosum without cerebellar
involvement or white matter abnormalities. Spasticity was restricted to
the lower limbs; 3 patients had sphincter disturbances.

.0014
SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA 3, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
ATL1, ARG415GLN

In 4 Moroccan sibs with SPG3A (182600), Varga et al. (2013) identified a
c.1244A-G transition in the ATL1 gene, resulting in an arg415-to-gln
(R415Q) substitution. Three sibs were homozygous and 1 was heterozygous
for the mutation. Heterozygosity for the mutation was then found in 3
unaffected family members and in 2 family members who had very subtle
signs of the disorder (hyperreflexia). These findings suggested complete
penetrance for the mutation in homozygous state and incomplete
penetrance for the mutation in heterozygous state. Varga et al. (2013)
also identified a heterozygous c.1243C-T transition, resulting in an
R415W (606439.0007) substitution in another family with SPG3A and
incomplete penetrance. Varga et al. (2013) noted that both the c.1243C-T
and c.1244A-G transitions occur at a CpG nucleotide (on the plus and
minus strands, respectively) and thus may represent a mutation hotspot
due to spontaneous deamination of methylated cytosines. R415 is a highly
conserved residue that does not localize to a known protein domain.

602744	TITLE *602744 GLYCERONEPHOSPHATE O-ACYLTRANSFERASE; GNPAT
;;DIHYDROXYACETONEPHOSPHATE ACYLTRANSFERASE; DHAPAT; DAPAT;;
ACYL-CoA:DIHYDROXYACETONEPHOSPHATE ACYLTRANSFERASE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Dihydroxyacetonephosphate acyltransferase (DHAPAT, or DAPAT; EC
2.3.1.42), a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of ether phospholipids, is
localized exclusively within peroxisomes.

CLONING

Thai et al. (1997) extracted the DHAPAT enzyme from rabbit Harderian
gland peroxisomes. From peptide sequences matching EST clones, they
isolated a DHAPAT cDNA by screening a human brain cDNA library. The
DHAPAT cDNA encodes a 680-amino acid peptide containing a C-terminal
type 1 peroxisomal targeting signal (PTS1).

Ofman and Wanders (1994) isolated the DHAPAT protein from human placenta
and Webber and Hajra (1993) purified it from guinea pig liver
peroxisomes. Ofman et al. (1998) determined the N-terminal amino acid
sequence of the enzyme isolated from human placenta and used this
sequence to identify a DHAPAT cDNA. They confirmed that DHAPAT contains
a PTS1 sequence (alanine-glycine-leucine) at the extreme C terminus.

GENE STRUCTURE

Thai et al. (2001) determined that the GNPAT gene contains 16 exons
spanning 30 kb.

MAPPING

Thai et al. (2001) mapped the GNPAT gene to chromosome 1q42 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Partial deficiency of DHAPAT occurs in most patients with rhizomelic
chondrodysplasia punctata (RCDP), along with deficiency of 4 other
peroxisomal enzymes in type 1 RCDP (215100). In addition, there are 2
forms of RCDP resulting from isolated deficiency of DHAPAT or of
alkyldihydroxyacetonephosphate synthase (alkyl-DHAP synthase),
designated as RCDP type 2 (222765) and type 3 (see 600121),
respectively, by Ofman et al. (1998). Ofman et al. (1998) identified 5
different mutations in DHAPAT in a group of 8 patients with type 2 RCDP.

Thai et al. (2001) identified homozygous and compound heterozygous
mutations in the GNPAT gene in 3 DHAPAT-deficient patients (602744.0001
and 602744.0006-602744.0007). As a consequence of the resulting
plasmalogen deficiency, structural alterations of caveolae,
clathrin-coated pits, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi cisternae were
observed, as well as a reduced rate of transferrin receptor cycling. The
authors hypothesized that plasmalogens, analogous to cholesterol, are
essential for correct membrane functioning, and their deficiency results
in impaired membrane trafficking.

Itzkovitz et al. (2012) studied 6 patients with RCDP, 3 with RCDP2 and 3
with RCDP3 (600121), and identified homozygosity or compound
heterozygosity for mutations in the GNPAT (see, e.g.,
603744.0007-603744.0009) or AGPS (see, e.g., 603051.0004) genes,
respectively. Comparison of phenotypic severity and GNPAT and AGPS
protein levels in patients with RCDP1 (215100), RCDP2, or RCDP3
indicated that milder RCDP phenotypes are likely to be associated with
residual protein function. In RCDP2 patient cell lines, GNPAT protein
was undetectable, although AGPS amounts were normal, indicating that the
absence of GNPAT does not affect levels of AGPS at steady state. In
contrast, in RCDP3 patient cell lines, GNPAT protein levels correlated
generally with the amount of AGPS protein present; Itzkovitz et al.
(2012) concluded that at steady state, the amount of wildtype GNPAT was
highly dependent on the presence of AGPS.

ANIMAL MODEL

Rodemer et al. (2003) generated a mouse model for RCDP by a targeted
disruption of the Dhapat gene. The mutant mice revealed multiple
abnormalities, such as male infertility, defects in eye development,
cataract, and optic nerve hypoplasia, some of which are also observed in
RCDP. Mass spectroscopic analysis demonstrated the presence of highly
unsaturated fatty acids including docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in brain
plasmalogens and the occurrence of plasmalogens in lipid raft
microdomains (LRMs) isolated from brain myelin. In mutants, plasmalogens
were completely absent and the concentration of brain DHA was reduced.
The marker proteins flotillin-1 (FLOT1; 606998) and contactin (CNTN1;
600016) were found in brain LRMs in reduced concentrations. In addition,
the gap junctional protein connexin-43 (GJA1; 121014), known to be
recruited to LRMs and essential for lens development and
spermatogenesis, was downregulated in embryonic fibroblasts of the ether
lipid-deficient mice. In these fibroblasts, free cholesterol, an
important constituent of LRMs, was found to be accumulated in a
perinuclear compartment. Rodemer et al. (2003) concluded that
plasmalogens may be required for the correct assembly and function of
LRMs.

Teigler et al. (2009) characterized a mouse model carrying a targeted
deletion of Dhapat gene that results in the complete lack of ether
lipids (ELs). The cerebellum of these mice demonstrated defects in
foliation patterning and delay in precursor granule cell migration and
defects in myelination and concomitant reduction in the level of myelin
basic protein. Further studies showed disturbances in paranode
organization by extending Caspr (CNTNAP1; 602346) distribution and
disrupting axoglial septate-like junctions, impaired innervation of
Purkinje cells by both parallel fibers and climbing fibers, and
formation of axon swellings by the accumulation of
inositol-trisphosphate receptor-1 (ITPR1; 147265) containing smooth
ER-like tubuli. Functionally, conduction velocity of myelinated axons in
the corpus callosum was significantly reduced.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
RHIZOMELIC CHONDRODYSPLASIA PUNCTATA, TYPE 2
GNPAT, ARG211HIS

In 2 brothers and a sister with rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata and
absence of DHAPAT activity (RCDP2; 222765), who were born of
consanguineous parents, Ofman et al. (1998) demonstrated homozygosity
for a 632G-A transition in the GNPAT gene, resulting in an arg211-to-his
(R211H) substitution. One of the sibs had been described in detail by
Clayton et al. (1994); the patient had a mild form of RCDP with no
evidence of rhizomelic shortening of the limbs or cataract and with only
subtle dysmorphic features.

In 2 brothers with RCDP and DHAPAT deficiency, born of healthy
first-cousin parents, Thai et al. (2001) identified compound
heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the GNPAT gene: the R211H mutation and
a 1556A-G transition in exon 11, resulting in an asp519-to-gly (D519G;
602744.0006) substitution. Functional analysis revealed loss of enzyme
activity with the R211H mutant, and an approximately 70% reduction in
enzyme activity with D519G. The brothers presented at ages 1 year and 3
years, respectively, with developmental delay, hypotonia, failure to
thrive, microcephaly, subtle dysmorphic features, and marked punctate
epiphyseal calcifications.

.0002
RHIZOMELIC CHONDRODYSPLASIA PUNCTATA, TYPE 2
GNPAT, ARG211CYS

In a male patient with unrelated parents and a mild form of RCDP
(222765), Ofman et al. (1998) demonstrated a 631C-T transition,
resulting in an arg211-to-cys amino acid substitution affecting the same
codon as that involved in the R211H mutation (602744.0001).

.0003
RHIZOMELIC CHONDRODYSPLASIA PUNCTATA, TYPE 2
GNPAT, 2-BP INS, 848TT

In a female patient who was described by Wanders et al. (1992) and
showed all the clinical manifestations associated with RCDP (222765),
Ofman et al. (1998) demonstrated homozygosity for an insertion of 2
nucleotides, TT after nucleotide 848, resulting in a frameshift and a
premature stop. Homozygosity for the same mutation was demonstrated in a
fetus from the same parents. Prenatal diagnosis had revealed severe
DHAPAT deficiency in amniotic fluid cells. After elective termination,
the diagnosis was confirmed by activity measurements in fetal skin
fibroblasts.

.0004
RHIZOMELIC CHONDRODYSPLASIA PUNCTATA, TYPE 2
GNPAT, 1-BP DEL, NT780

In a male patient who presented with all the clinical abnormalities
characteristic for RCDP (222765) including rhizomelic shortening of the
limbs, facial dysmorphia, and mental retardation, Ofman et al. (1998)
found homozygous deletion of a single nucleotide at position 780 which
caused a frameshift leading to a premature stop codon (TGA) at position
787 and a truncated version of the DHAPAT protein.

.0005
RHIZOMELIC CHONDRODYSPLASIA PUNCTATA, TYPE 2
GNPAT, 1-BP DEL, NT1575

In a female patient with a mild form of RCDP (222765) whose parents were
unrelated, Ofman et al. (1998) found homozygosity for a 1-bp deletion at
nucleotide 1575 in the DHAPAT cDNA.

RHIZOMELIC CHONDRODYSPLASIA PUNCTATA, TYPE 2
GNPAT, IVS9, T-G, -3

In a girl with rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata and DHAPAT
deficiency (RCDP2; 222765) who was originally described by Elias et al.
(1998), Thai et al. (2001) identified homozygosity for a -3G-A
transition in intron 9 of the GNPAT gene, resulting in deletion of all
243 base pairs comprising exon 10 (del1281_1523).

In an 8-year-old boy with RCDP, Itzkovitz et al. (2012) identified
compound heterozygosity for the intron 9 splice site mutation
(1280-3T-G) resulting in 427_507del, and a 2-bp deletion
(1429_1430delAT; 602744.0008) in exon 10 of the GNPAT gene that was not
present as a polymorphism in dbSNP (build 133). The patient had
rhizomelia of the upper extremities, stippled epiphyses in shoulders and
knees, metaphyseal irregularities, vertebral coronal clefts, and
shortening of the posterior arch of C1. Brain MRI at 1 year of age
showed myelination delays and volume loss. His general health was good
except for a seizure disorder. At age 8 years, he could not speak, but
could scoot, walk in a walker, and peddle an adaptive tricycle. In a
cell line from the patient, GNPAT was absent but AGPS protein levels
were normal. RT-PCR and sequencing of GNPAT transcripts in cell lines
from this patient and the girl originally described by Elias et al.
(1998) revealed only 1 transcript, containing an in-frame deletion of
exon 10. Itzkovitz et al. (2012) suggested that the milder phenotype in
the girl might be due to residual protein from two 427_507del alleles
versus just 1.

RHIZOMELIC CHONDRODYSPLASIA PUNCTATA, TYPE 2
GNPAT, IVS14, G-A, +5

In a 6.5-year-old boy with rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata and
absent DHAPAT (RCDP2; 222765), born to first-cousin parents of Jordanian
descent, Itzkovitz et al. (2012) identified homozygosity for a 1937+5G-A
transition in intron 14 of the GNPAT gene. The mutation was not present
as a polymorphism in dbSNP (build 133). RT-PCR and sequencing revealed 2
cDNA species, a larger band containing an intact intron 14 and a
smaller, less-intense band containing normal sequence. GNPAT protein was
undetectable in a cell line from the patient; however, AGPS protein
levels were normal. The patient had rhizomelia of the upper extremities
and bilateral cataracts. Radiographs showed stippled epiphyses; brain
MRI shortly after birth was normal. He spoke his first word at 1 year of
age and sat independently at 16 months; at 4.5 years of age, he was
walking with a walker. He had ongoing problems with dysphagia,
aspiration, and vesicoureteral reflux, but otherwise was in general good
health. Itzkovitz et al. (2012) suggested that the less severe clinical
and biochemical phenotype in this patient might be due to residual GNPAT
enzyme activity from reduced amounts of wildtype protein.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The specific inhibitors of plasminogen activators (173370, 191840) have
been classified into 4 immunologically distinct groups: PAI1 type PA
inhibitor from endothelial cells (173360); PAI2 type PA inhibitor from
placenta, monocytes, and macrophages; urinary inhibitor; and
protease-nexin-I. Antalis et al. (1988) purified human monocyte-derived
plasminogen activator inhibitor to homogeneity and partially sequenced
it. They used oligonucleotide probes derived from this sequence to
screen a cDNA library. By nucleotide sequence analysis, they showed that
the PAI2 cDNA encodes a protein containing 450 amino acids with a
predicted unglycosylated molecular mass of 46,543. Plasminogen activator
inhibitor-2 is also known as monocyte arg-serpin because it belongs to
the superfamily of serine proteases in which the target specificity of
each is determined by the amino acid residue located at its reactive
center; i.e., met or val for elastase, leu for kinase, and arg for
thrombin.

Webb et al. (1987) isolated the cDNA encoding a monocyte-derived PAI.

GENE FUNCTION

Kruithof et al. (1995) concluded that although a large body of
information has accumulated on the biology, biochemistry, and clinical
aspects of PAI2, suggesting that it is involved in many physiologic and
pathologic processes, its precise role in placenta, in pregnancy plasma,
in skin, and in inflammatory conditions, as well as the diagnostic and
therapeutic possibilities of PAI2, remained to be established.

Using gene expression microarrays, Woodruff et al. (2007) found that
CLCA1 (603906), periostin (POSTN; 608777), and SERPINB2 were upregulated
in airway epithelial cells of individuals with asthma (see 600807), but
not smokers. Corticosteroid treatment downregulated expression of these
3 genes and upregulated expression of FKBP51 (602623). High baseline
expression of CLCA1, POSTN, and SERPINB2 was associated with a good
clinical response to corticosteroids, whereas high expression of FKBP51
was associated with a poor response. Treatment of airway epithelial
cells with IL13 resulted in increased expression of CLCA1, POSTN, and
SERPINB2, an effect that could be suppressed by corticosteroids.

Gastrin (GAS; 137250) regulates the expression of a variety of genes
involved in the control of acid secretion. It also triggers tissue
response to damage, infection, and inflammation in cells expressing
gastrin receptor (CCKBR; 118445) and, indirectly, in nearby cells via a
paracrine mechanism. Almeida-Vega et al. (2009) found that gastrin
directly induced upregulation of PAI2 in CCKBR-positive cells.
CCKBR-positive cells also released IL8 (146930) and prostaglandin E2
into the culture medium in response to gastrin, which resulted in
elevated PAI2 expression in cocultured CCKBR-negative cells. IL8
signaling in CCKBR-negative cells upregulated PAI2 via binding of the
ASC1 complex (see TRIP4; 604501) to the PAI2 promoter. Prostaglandin E2
independently upregulated PAI2 via RHOA (165390)-dependent signaling
that induced binding of MAZ (600999) to the PAI2 promoter.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation
analysis revealed that MAZ and the p50 subunit of the ASC1 complex
(ASCC1; 614215) bound directly to sites in the PAI2 promoter. Mutation
of the putative MAZ site in the PAI2 promoter reduced responses to RHOA.
Knockdown of the p50 or p65 (TRIP4) subunits of the ASC1 complex via
small interfering RNA significantly reduced PAI2 upregulation in
response to gastrin.

GENE STRUCTURE

Samia et al. (1990) demonstrated that the intron-exon arrangement of
PAI2 is identical to that of chicken ovalbumin and Y genes and distinct
from that of other members of the serpin superfamily.

MAPPING

By Southern blot analysis of human-mouse somatic cell hybrid DNA, Webb
et al. (1987) located the PAI2 gene, which they called PLANH2, to human
chromosome 18. Oldenburg et al. (1989) also assigned PAI2 to chromosome
18 by Southern analysis of rodent-human somatic cell hybrid DNAs. By in
situ hybridization, Webb et al. (1989) assigned the PLANH2 gene to
18q21.2-q22. By YAC cloning of a 2-Mb contig within chromosomal band
18q21, Silverman et al. (1991) established physical linkage of BCL2
(151430) with PLANH2. They concluded that PLANH2 is 600 kb telomeric to
BCL2 and has an opposite transcriptional orientation.

Bartuski et al. (1997) identified 6 genes in a 500-kb region of 18q21.3.
The order of the 6 genes from centromere to telomere was determined to
be cen--PI5 (154790)--SCCA2 (600518)--SCCA1 (600517)--PAI2--PI10
(602058)--PI8 (601697)--tel.

ANIMAL MODEL

PAI2 is thought to serve as a primary regulator of plasminogen
activation in the extravascular compartment. High levels of PAI2 are
found in keratinocytes, monocytes, and the human trophoblast, the latter
suggesting a role in placental maintenance or in embryo development. The
primarily intracellular distribution of PAI2 may also indicate a unique
regulatory role in a protease-dependent cellular process such as
apoptosis (Dickinson et al., 1995). To examine the potential functions
of PAI2 in vivo, Dougherty et al. (1999) generated PAI2-deficient mice
by gene targeting in embryonic stem cells. Homozygous PAI2-deficient
mice exhibited normal development, survival, and fertility, and were
also indistinguishable from normal controls in response to a bacterial
infectious challenge or endotoxin infusion. No differences in monocyte
recruitment into the peritoneum were observed after thioglycollate
injection. Epidermal wound healing was equivalent among null and control
mice. Finally, crossing PAI2 -/- with PAI1 -/- mice to generate animals
deficient in both plasminogen activator inhibitors failed to uncover an
overlap in function between these 2 related proteins.
