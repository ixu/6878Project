610825	TITLE *610825 SOLUTE CARRIER FAMILY 25, MEMBER 45; SLC25A45
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SLC25A45 belongs to the SLC25 family of mitochondrial carrier proteins
(Haitina et al., 2006).

CLONING

By searching databases for SLC25 family members, Haitina et al. (2006)
identified 4 splice variants of SLC25A45. The deduced protein contains
304 amino acids. Quantitative real-time PCR detected variable expression
in most rat tissues examined, with highest levels in skeletal muscle,
intestine, and brain coronal sections containing olfactory bulb and
cerebral cortex.

GENE STRUCTURE

Haitina et al. (2006) determined that the SLC25A45 gene contains 7
exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Haitina et al. (2006) mapped the SLC25A45
gene to chromosome 11. They mapped the mouse gene to chromosome 19.

608953	TITLE *608953 TEKTIN 2; TEKT2
;;TEKTIN, TESTICULAR;;
TEKTIN-T;;
TEKTIN B1; TEKTB1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TEKT2 and other members of the tektin protein family form filamentous
polymers in the walls of ciliary and flagellar microtubules (Iguchi et
al., 2002).

CLONING

Using mouse tektin-t to screen a human testis cDNA library, Iguchi et
al. (2002) cloned TEKT2, which they called tektin-t. The deduced
430-amino acid protein contains evolutionarily conserved tektin motifs
and 5 N-glycosylation sites. Human and mouse TEKT2 share 83% amino acid
identity. Northern blot analysis detected a 1.7-kb transcript expressed
strongly in testis and weakly in ovary. Western blot analysis of testis
showed a TEKT2 protein with an apparent molecular mass of 54 kD. In
sperm, a major protein of 56 kD, a minor protein of 46 kD, and a weakly
expressed protein of 54 kD were detected. The 56- and 54-kD proteins
bound concanavalin A, indicating that they were N-glycosylated, but the
46-kD protein did not. Immunostaining of human sperm revealed TEKT2
expressed in a discontinuous punctate pattern in the flagellum and in
the postacrosomal head region, with 2 positive spots in the tangential
view. A somewhat different staining pattern was found in mouse sperm.

By sequencing tryptic fragments of purified human TEKT2 protein,
followed by RT-PCR of testis mRNA and screening a testis cDNA library,
Wolkowicz et al. (2002) cloned TEKT2, which they called TEKB1. The
deduced 430-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 49.7
kD. TEKT2 contains a chaperonin signature motif, several
serine/threonine and tyrosine kinase phosphorylation sites, and 5
N-glycosylation sites. The central region of TEKT2 shares significant
similarity with sea urchin tektin B1, but the N and C termini differ.
Northern blot analysis detected a 1.5-kb transcript only in testis. RNA
dot blot analysis detected highest TEKT2 expression in testis, followed
by adult trachea and fetal lung. Weaker expression was detected in
ovary, pituitary, adult lung, fetal brain, and fetal kidney. SAGE data
indicated that TEKT2 was also expressed in cerebellum and mammary gland
tumors. Immunofluorescence analysis did not detect TEKT2 on the sperm
surface. In permeabilized sperm, TEKT2 localized to the principal piece
of the sperm flagellum, suggesting an axonemal location. TEKT2 was also
found at the base of the sperm head in a location corresponding to the
basal body.

GENE STRUCTURE

Wolkowicz et al. (2002) determined that the TEKT2 gene contains 10 exons
and spans 4.2 kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis and genomic sequence analysis, Iguchi et
al. (2002) mapped the TEKT2 gene to chromosome 1pter-p32.3. Wolkowicz et
al. (2002) also mapped the TEKT2 gene to chromosome 1pter-p32.3.

ANIMAL MODEL

Tanaka et al. (2004) found that Tekt2 null male mice were infertile, but
Tekt2 null female mice were fully fertile. Sperm morphology and function
were abnormal, with frequent bending of the sperm flagella and marked
defects in motility. In vitro fertilization assays showed that the
defective spermatozoa were able to fertilize eggs. However, electron
microscopic examination showed that the dynein inner arm structure was
disrupted. Homozygous mutant mice also had functionally defective
tracheal cilia with altered dynein arm morphology. Tanaka et al. (2004)
concluded that TEKT2 participates in dynein inner arm formation or
attachment and that the loss of TEKT2 results in impaired motility of
both flagella and cilia.

601838	TITLE *601838 INOSITOL 1,3,4-TRISPHOSPHATE 5/6-KINASE; ITPK1
;;ITRPK1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Based on a bovine peptide sequence, Wilson and Majerus (1996) found a
human EST corresponding to the inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate 5/6-kinase
gene (ITRPK1). They used this EST to clone the cDNA of ITRPK1 from a
human fetal brain cDNA library. This cDNA encodes a 414-amino acid
polypeptide. Northern blot analysis revealed that ITRPK1 was expressed
as a 3.6-kb message in all tissues tested, with the highest levels in
brain. Expression of the cDNA resulted in inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate
5/6-kinase activity, showing that a single kinase phosphorylates
inositol in both the D5 and D6 positions.

By database searching with the ITPK1 sequence to identify an enzyme with
1-kinase activity, Yang and Shears (2000) also obtained a cDNA encoding
ITPK1 but with a serine replacing asparagine-356. Functional analysis
showed that the variant, which they called the type beta protein, as
well as the protein with asn356, which they called the type alpha
protein, phosphorylated not only the 5- and 6-hydroxy groups of
Ins(1,3,4)P3 but also the 1-hydroxy group of Ins(3,4,5,6)P4, suggesting
that the 2 inositol phosphates compete for phosphorylation in vivo. Yang
and Shears (2000) concluded that the same kinase is charged with
performing competing activities that both activate and deactivate a
signaling pathway.

615507	TITLE *615507 NISCHARIN; NISCH
;;IMIDAZOLINE RECEPTOR ANTISERA-SELECTED; IRAS;;
KIAA0975
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Full-length nischarin is an integrin-binding protein with a role in cell
motility (Alahari et al., 2004).

CLONING

Using antisera developed against nonadrenergic imidazoline-binding
proteins to screen a human hippocampal cDNA expression library, Ivanov
et al. (1998) cloned NISCH. The deduced 595-amino acid protein has 4
transmembrane domains, a zinc finger domain, and a glutamic acid- and
aspartic acid-rich region. NISCH shows regions of similarity with
chromogranin-A precursor (118910) and ryanodine receptor (see RYR1,
180901). Northern blot analysis detected variable expression of 6.0- and
9.5-kb transcripts in all 36 human tissues examined. The smaller
transcript predominated, and highest overall expression was detected in
pituitary. In situ hybridization of rat brain showed strongest
expression in pyramidal cell layers of hippocampus and granular layer
and hillus of the dentate gyrus.

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated human brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1999) cloned NISCH, which they designated
KIAA0975. The deduced protein contains 1,528 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA
detected variable NISCH expression in all adult and fetal tissues
examined. Very high expression was detected in fetal brain, followed by
adult kidney, testis, ovary, brain, and spinal cord. Within specific
adult brain regions, highest expression was detected in corpus callosum,
amygdala, cerebellum, and caudate nucleus.

By EST database analysis, Piletz et al. (2003) identified 3 splice
variants of NISCH, which they called IRAS. The transcripts differed in
splicing between exons 13 and 14. The transcript of the primary isoform,
IRAS-M, encodes the full-length 1,504-amino acid protein. The shorter
transcript, IRAS-S, includes an internal polyadenylation signal sequence
and encodes a deduced 515-amino acid protein. The longer truncated
transcript, IRAS-L, encodes a deduced 583-amino acid protein. The 3
proteins are identical for the first 510 amino acids, which includes the
PxxP and leucine-rich repeat domains. Only IRAS-M contains the putative
imidazoline-binding region, alpha-5 integrin (ITGA5; 135620)-binding
domain, and C-terminal domain with similarity to insulin receptor
substrate proteins (see IRS1, 147545). Northern blot analysis detected
IRAS transcripts at 9.5, 5.5, and 3.0 kb in all human brain regions
examined and in spinal cord. In most areas, IRAS-M predominated.
Following expression in CHO cells, SDS-PAGE detected IRAS-M, IRAS-S, and
IRAS-L at apparent molecular masses of 167, 57, and 65 kD, respectively.

Alahari et al. (2004) stated that full-length mouse nischarin is 1,354
amino acids long. It has an N-terminal leucine-rich repeat region,
followed by 2 PxxP motifs, an integrin-binding domain, a central
proline- and alanine-rich domain, and a C-terminal leucine zipper with
an additional PxxP motif. The integrin-binding domain contains a leucine
zipper and a cytochrome P450 (see CYP3A4, 124010) cysteine heme-iron
ligand signature.

GENE FUNCTION

Piletz et al. (2003) found that human IRAS-M and IRAS-L, but not IRAS-S,
increased binding of radiolabeled iodoclonidine to transfected CHO
cells.

Alahari et al. (2004) stated that full-length mouse nischarin interacts
with the cytoplasmic domain of alpha-5 integrin in the alpha-5/beta-1
integrin (ITGB1; 135630) complex and that nischarin inhibits cell
migration when overexpressed. By cotransfecting COS-7 cells, they found
that nischarin also specifically interacted with the kinase domain of
human PAK1 (602590), which is involved in cell motility. Mouse nischarin
and human PAK1 colocalized to membrane ruffles in transfected rat
embryonic fibroblasts. Domain and mutation analysis revealed that an
N-terminal domain of nischarin interacted with PAK1 in the active 'open'
conformation, which normally occurs following Rac (see 602048)-dependent
phosphorylation. Binding to nischarin inhibited PAK1 kinase activity and
cell migration, and the presence of alpha-5/beta-1 integrin further
enhanced the interaction between nischarin and PAK1. Knockout of
nischarin in rat PC12 cells via small interfering RNA resulted in Pak
activation and increased cell migration. Alahari et al. (2004) concluded
that nischarin has a role in regulating cell migration.

Using reciprocal coprecipitation assays, Jain et al. (2013) found that
endogenous nischarin and the kinase LKB1 (STK11; 602216) interacted in
the cytoplasm of human breast cancer cell lines. Knockdown of both
nischarin and LKB1 enhanced cell migration, which was due to elevated
PAK1 and LIMK1 (601329) phosphorylation. Absence of nischarin and LKB1
increased breast cancer cell growth following injection in nude mice.

GENE STRUCTURE

Piletz et al. (2003) determined that the NISCH gene contains 21 exons
and spans 37 kb. Intron 13 is subject to alternative splicing and
contains stop codons and an internal polyadenylation site.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Piletz et al. (2003) mapped the NISCH gene
to chromosome 3p21.1.

158374	TITLE *158374 MUCIN 6, GASTRIC; MUC6
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The MUC6 gene encodes gastric mucin, a secreted glycoprotein that plays
an essential role in epithelial cytoprotection from acid, proteases,
pathogenic microorganisms, and mechanical trauma in the gastrointestinal
tract (summary by Toribara et al., 1993).

CLONING

By expression cloning, Toribara et al. (1993) isolated cDNAs coding for
human gastric mucin. Expression of the gene was highest in the stomach
and gallbladder, with weaker expression in the terminal ileum and right
colon.

Reid and Harris (1998) used tissue in situ hybridization to study MUC6
gene expression in midtrimester human fetal gut. MUC6 mRNA was detected
at low levels in the small intestine between 13 and 23 weeks' gestation.
Abundant MUC6 mRNA was detected in gastric neck mucous cells, in
contrast with MUC5AC (158373). MUC6 mRNA was present at high levels in
pancreatic ductal epithelium throughout the midtrimester.

Rousseau et al. (2004) described the domain structure of human MUC6.
MUC6 contains an N-terminal signal peptide, followed by several von
Willebrand factor (VWF; 613160)-like domains, a large tandem repeat
domain, and a C-terminal cystine knot domain.

GENE FUNCTION

Sekine et al. (2006) found that expression of HATH1 (ATOH1; 601461) was
lost in 5 of 8 gastric cancer (GC) cell lines examined, whereas normal
gastric mucosa expressed HATH1. Expression of the gastric mucin genes
MUC6 and MUC5AC showed a correlation with that of HATH1 in most GC cell
lines. Overexpression of Math1, a mouse HATH1 homolog, in GC cells
strongly enhanced MUC6 and MUC5AC mRNA levels. RNA interference-mediated
downregulation of HATH1 in GC cells led to decreased expression of the
mucin genes. Sekine et al. (2006) concluded that HATH1 is a
transcriptional regulator for MUC5AC and MUC6 in GC cells and that HATH1
loss may be involved in gastric carcinogenesis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Rousseau et al. (2004) determined that the MUC6 gene contains 30 5-prime
exons, 1 large central exon containing the tandem repeat domain, and 2
3-prime exons.

Kwon et al. (2010) noted that the MUC6 gene contains 35 exons and spans
about 24 kb.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Toribara et al. (1993) mapped the
MUC6 gene to chromosome 11p15.5-p15.4. Two other mucin genes (MUC2,
158370; MUC5AC, 158373) have been mapped to the 11p15 region, suggesting
a clustering of secretory mucin genes.

Rousseau et al. (2004) determined that the MUC6 and MUC2 genes are
located 38.5 kb apart in a head-to-head orientation within a gene
complex on chromosome 11p15.5.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Kwon et al. (2010) identified 5 variable number tandem repeat (VNTR)
minisatellite polymorphisms in the MUC6 gene, which they termed MS1 to
MS5. MS1 and MS2 are located in the promoter region, MS3 in intron 1,
MS4 in intron 8, and MS5 in intron 26. All were shown to be meiotically
stable and subject to mendelian inheritance. Among 470 Korean patients
with gastric cancer (137215) and 1,103 controls, there was no difference
in the frequency of alleles for MS1 to MS4. However, there was a
significant association between the rare MS5 short alleles and gastric
cancer (p = 0.005; OR, 7.08), particularly for poorly differentiated
gastric cancer. An analysis of 700 gastric cancer cases showed that
those with short alleles lacked MUC6 gene expression. The MS5 region
contained several putative transcription factor binding sites, and
studies of transfected cells showed that the short MS5 allele
significantly decreased reporter gene expression. These findings
suggested that susceptibility to gastric cancer may be related to
variation in MUC6 gene expression.

610516	TITLE *610516 GLYCERATE KINASE; GLYCTK
;;GLYCTK1
GLYCTK2, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database searching with the prokaryotic sequence of glycerate kinase
(EC 2.7.1.31) as query, followed by PCR of a fetal liver cDNA library,
Guo et al. (2006) cloned 2 splice variants of GLYCTK. The longer
variant, GLYCTK1, encodes a deduced 523-amino acid protein. The shorter
variant, GLYCTK2, which lacks exon 4, encodes a deduced 234-amino acid
protein. PCR analysis of 17 human tissues detected variable levels of
both transcripts in all tissues examined. In situ hybridization of adult
mouse tissues showed Glyctk in several specific brain regions, in renal
cortex interstitial cells, in epithelium of the interlobular bile duct,
and in skeletal muscle. Fluorescence-tagged GLYCTK1 and GLYCTK2 were
localized in cytoplasmic particles in transfected COS-7 cells. GLYCTK2,
but not GLYCTK1, localized in mitochondria.

GENE STRUCTURE

Guo et al. (2006) determined that the GLYCTK gene contains 6 exons and
spans more than 4 kb. Exons 1 and 6 are noncoding.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Guo et al. (2006) mapped the GLYCTK gene
to chromosome 3p21.

GENE FUNCTION

In the liver of a patient with D-glyceric acidemia (220120), Van
Schaftingen (1989) found that glycerate kinase activity was less than 5%
of normal, whereas D-glycerate dehydrogenase (glyoxylate reductase) and
triokinase activities were normal.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 3 unrelated patients with D-glyceric aciduria (220120), Sass et al.
(2010) identified 3 different homozygous mutations in the GLYCTK gene
(610516.0001-610516.0003), all occurring in exon 5. In vitro functional
expression studies in HEK293 cells showed that the proteins were not
expressed and had no enzymatic activity.

In fibroblasts taken from the Serbian boy with D-glyceric aciduria
(220120), originally reported by Brandt et al. (1974), Sass et al.
(2010) identified a homozygous 1-bp deletion (1448delT) in exon 5 of the
GLYCTK gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature truncation. In
vitro functional expression studies in HEK293 cells showed that the
mutant protein was not expressed and had no enzymatic activity. The
mutation was not found in 214 control chromosomes. Clinical features
reported by Brandt et al. (1974) included neonatal hypotonia, delayed
psychomotor development, mental retardation, and seizures.

GLYCTK, PHE493CYS

In a Mexican girl with D-glyceric aciduria (220120), Sass et al. (2010)
identified a homozygous 1478T-G transversion in exon 5 of the GLYCTK
gene, resulting in a phe493-to-cys (F493C) substitution in a highly
conserved residue. In vitro functional expression studies in HEK293
cells showed that the mutant protein was not expressed and had no
enzymatic activity. The mutation was not found in 214 control
chromosomes. The patient was born prematurely and showed hypotonia,
spasticity, microcephaly, seizures, and severe global developmental
delay.

.0003
D-GLYCERIC ACIDURIA
GLYCTK, 1-BP DEL, 1558C

In a Turkish boy, born of consanguineous parents, with D-glyceric
aciduria (220120), Sass et al. (2010) identified a homozygous 1-bp
deletion (1558delC) in exon 5 of the GLYCTK gene, resulting in a
frameshift and an extension of protein synthesis, predicted to lead to
degradation. In vitro functional expression studies in HEK293 cells
showed that the mutant protein was not expressed and had no enzymatic
activity. The mutation was not found in 214 control chromosomes. The
patient also had combined pituitary hormone deficiency-5 (182230), but
was thriving and developing at age 8 weeks.

607242	TITLE *607242 ADAPTOR-RELATED PROTEIN COMPLEX 2, ALPHA-2 SUBUNIT; AP2A2
;;KIAA0899
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By randomly sequencing cDNA clones from size-fractionated human brain
cDNA libraries, Nagase et al. (1998) identified AP2A2, which they
designated KIAA0899. The deduced 929-amino acid protein shares more than
97% sequence identity with rat alpha-adaptin. By RT-PCR analysis
followed by ELISA for quantitation, they detected ubiquitous,
low-to-moderate expression of KIAA0899, with highest levels in spinal
cord and fetal and adult brain and lowest levels in spleen.

Using the N terminus of huntingtin (HTT; 613004) in a yeast 2-hybrid
screen of a testis cDNA library, Faber et al. (1998) identified AP2A2,
which they designated huntingtin yeast partner J (HYPJ). The predicted
protein shares significant sequence identity with mouse alpha-adaptin C.

MAPPING

604174	TITLE *604174 RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN L15; RPL15
DESCRIPTION The mammalian ribosome is composed of 4 RNA species (see 180450) and
approximately 80 different proteins (see 180466).

Adams et al. (1992) isolated an RPL15 cDNA as a human brain EST that
shows sequence similarity to the yeast ribosomal protein YL10 gene.

The complete coding sequence of the human RPL15 gene has been deposited
in GenBank (GENBANK L25899). The deduced RPL15 protein has 205 amino
acids.

By somatic cell hybrid and radiation hybrid mapping analyses, Kenmochi
et al. (1998) mapped the human RPL15 gene to 3p.

;;SERUM-INDUCIBLE KINASE; SNK
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Serum-inducible kinase is a member of the 'polo' family of
serine/threonine protein kinases that have a role in normal cell
division.

CLONING

Liby et al. (2001) identified SNK in a database search of sequences with
significant homology to the polo kinases PRK (CNK; 602913) and PLK
(602098). The deduced 685-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular
mass of about 78 kD and contains an ATP-binding motif within the kinase
domain and a conserved polo box. SNK shares about 97% sequence identity
with the mouse and rat proteins. Dot blot analysis indicated a
ubiquitous low level of SNK expression. Highest expression was found in
adult testis, spleen, putamen, and occipital lobe, and in fetal lung,
spleen, kidney, and heart.

GENE FUNCTION

By Northern blot analysis, Liby et al. (2001) found rapid induction of
SNK mRNA in human lung fibroblasts upon reintroduction of serum
following 36 hours of serum deprivation.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the SNK
gene to chromosome 5 (TMAP WI-13092).

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

High molecular weight kininogen (HMWK) plays an important role in
assembly of the plasma kallikrein (see 147910)-kinin system. The KNG1
gene generates both HMWK and low molecular weight kininogen (LMWK)
through alternative splicing. Both HMWK and LMWK contain an identical
heavy chain consisting of protein domains 1, 2, and 3. However, HMWK
contains a 56-kD light chain that consists of domains 5 and 6H, whereas
LMWK contains a unique 4-kD light chain that consists of domain 5L. In
both proteins, the heavy and light chains are linked by domain 4, which
contains the bradykinin (BK) nonapeptide. BK, which is released by
plasma kallikrein, is a potent inflammatory mediator that causes
vasodilation and enhanced capillary permeability, induces pain, and
stimulates production of nitric oxide and prostacyclin (see 601699) from
endothelial cells. During vascular damage, BK stimulates smooth muscle
proliferation and intimal hypertrophy. Release of BK from HMWK generates
a 2-chain HMWK, termed HMWKa, containing the heavy and light chains
joined by a disulfide bond (Merkulov et al., 2008).

CLONING

In the 1970s, a number of similar patients with abnormal coagulation
tests but no apparent bleeding tendency were identified and described as
lacking a coagulation factor variously termed Fitzgerald factor,
Flaujeac factor, or Williams factor, among other names (see 228960). At
first the nature of these factors was uncertain, but further studies
showed that they were identical to high molecular weight kininogen
(Davie, 1979; Giangrande, 2003).

Takagaki et al. (1985) isolated human cDNAs encoding the HMW and LMW
prekininogens. They determined that the HMW and LMW prekininogen mRNAs
are identical throughout the 5-prime UTR and the protein-coding region
up to the sequence encoding the 12 amino acids distal to the BK
sequence, after which the 2 mRNAs completely diverge. The HMW and LMW
prekininogens contain 626 and 427 amino acids, respectively. They share
a common signal peptide, heavy chain, and BK moiety, which consist of
18, 362, and 9 amino acids, respectively. The unique light chains of HMW
and LMW prekininogens consist of 255 and 38 amino acids, respectively.
There are 17 cysteines in both the bovine and human heavy chain,
indicating that the human heavy chain, like its bovine counterpart, can
form 8 loops, each connected by 2 adjacent cysteines.

Merkulov et al. (2008) determined that the mouse genome contains 2
kininogen genes, Kng1 and Kng2, that are 91% identical. Using RT-PCR,
they found that Kng1 was expressed predominantly in liver and adrenal
gland, whereas Kng2 was expressed predominantly in kidney, with lower
expression in liver.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kitamura et al. (1985) determined that the KNG1 gene contains 11 exons
and spans 27 kb. Exons 1 through 9 encode the 5-prime UTR and the signal
peptide and heavy chain sequences common to both HMWK and LMWK. Exon 10
encodes the common sequence for BK and the unique sequence for HMWK, and
exon 11 encodes the unique sequence for LMWK.

MAPPING

Fong et al. (1991) mapped the KNG gene to chromosome 3 using
human-hamster somatic cell hybrids and the PCR of hybrid DNA with
gene-specific primers. KNG was further assigned to chromosome 3q26-qter
using DNA from a second panel of chromosome 3 deletion mapping cell
hybrids. Cheung et al. (1992) also mapped the KNG gene to chromosome
3q26-qter by in situ hybridization. The assignment substantiated the
evolutionary relationship of kininogen to 2 other members of the
cystatin superfamily, alpha-2HS-glycoprotein (AHSG; 138680) and
histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRG; 142640), which also map to the long
arm of chromosome 3.

Merkulov et al. (2008) determined that the 2 mouse kininogen genes, Kng1
and Kng2, are located in a head-to-head orientation on chromosome 16.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Cheung et al. (1993) demonstrated that Ms. Williams, the patient with
total kininogen deficiency (228960) reported by Colman et al. (1975),
was homozygous for a nonsense mutation in the KNG1 gene (612358.0001).

Krijanovski et al. (2003) found that a 6-year-old boy with cerebral
artery thrombosis and HMWK deficiency was homozygous for a 1-bp deletion
of 1492A in the KNG1 gene (612358.0002), corresponding to amino acid 480
of the mature protein. The mutation resulted in a frameshift and
premature termination at amino acid 532 of the mature protein. Each
parent and a sib were heterozygous for the mutation. Krijanovski et al.
(2003) found that truncation or frameshift at or before position 480 of
mature HMWK prevented biosynthesis, processing, and/or secretion of the
protein into plasma. Krijanovski et al. (2003) also identified the
causative mutation in Fitzgerald trait as a 17-bp substitution in intron
9 of the KNG1 gene (612358.0003). They provided a diagram comparing the
molecular defects of Williams trait (612358.0001), their reported
deletion of 1492A, and Fitzgerald trait with normal HMWK.

Using immunoblot and Southern blot analyses, Hayashi et al. (1990)
detected no molecular abnormality of kininogen in the DNA from patients
from 4 Japanese families with total kininogen deficiency or from 1
patient with isolated HMWK deficiency. However, in the patient with
isolated HMWK deficiency, a partial deletion in intron 7 was found by
restriction analysis. This partial deletion was assumed to be related to
an abnormality of alternative splicing of HMW prekininogen mRNA.
However, Shigekiyo et al. (2007) found that this patient with isolated
HMWK deficiency was homozygous for a 1-bp insertion (C) at nucleotide
1217 in exon 10 of the KNG1 gene (612358.0004). The insertion resulted
in a frameshift in codon 406 and a premature stop signal in codon 415.
The patient's parents and brother were heterozygous for the mutation.

- Association with Decreased Activated Partial Thromboplastin
Time

Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is considered a global test
of thrombotic tendency. A shortened aPTT is associated with an increased
risk of thrombosis as well as several prothrombotic risk factors
including age, female sex, estrogen use, and obesity. Prolonged aPTT is
an indicator of coagulation disorders in patients with deficiencies of
factors in the intrinsic pathways of coagulation. Houlihan et al. (2010)
conducted a genomewide association study for activated partial
thromboplastin time (aPTT) in a total of 1,477 relatively healthy adults
from the Lothian Birth Cohorts of 1936 (LBC1936) and 1921 (LBC1921). A
highly significant association with a relatively large effect size was
found between aPTT and a SNP in the KNG1 gene, dbSNP rs710446 (combined
p = 9.52 x 10(-22)). The SNP dbSNP rs710446 represents a missense
change, ile581 to thr (I581T, 1742T-C), in exon 10 of kininogen 1
isoform 1. The effects of dbSNP rs710446 were additive, with each G
allele decreasing aPTT by 0.36 standard deviations. This SNP explained
5.2% and 8.1% of the variance in aPTT in LBC1936 and LBC1921,
respectively. Mutations in KNG1 cause high molecular weight kininogen
(HMWK) deficiency, an autosomal recessive coagulation defect; Kng1
knockout mice demonstrate prolonged aPTT and delayed arterial thrombosis
(Merkulov et al., 2008).

Among 1,542 European patients with venous thrombosis (see 188050) and
1,110 controls, Morange et al. (2011) found a significant association
between the C allele of dbSNP rs710446 and risk of thrombosis (odds
ratio (OR) of 1.196; p = 0.0012) A borderline association was observed
in a small independent sample of 590 controls and 596 patients (OR of
1.171; p = 0.059). This allele was also associated with decreased aPTT
levels. Morange et al. (2011) concluded that the I581T variant is a
genetic risk factor for venous thrombosis.

ANIMAL MODEL

Merkulov et al. (2008) found that Kng1 -/- mice were viable and appeared
normal, although they lacked plasma HMWK and LMWK. Kng1 -/- mice showed
normal tail vein bleeding times, but they displayed significantly
prolonged time to vessel occlusion in an induced arterial thrombosis
model.

KININOGEN DEFICIENCY, TOTAL
KNG1, ARG196TER

In the patient (Ms. Williams) with total kininogen deficiency (228960)
reported by Colman et al. (1975) as having Williams trait, Cheung et al.
(1993) found homozygosity for a C-to-T transition at nucleotide 22 in
exon 5 (nucleotide 587 of the cDNA) of the KNG1 gene, resulting in a CGA
(arg)-to-TGA (stop) mutation in exon 5. All 3 daughters were found to be
heterozygous and a granddaughter was found to be normal. In the proband,
both high and low molecular weight kininogens were completely absent;
the 3 daughters had approximately 50% high molecular weight kininogen
and the granddaughter had normal high molecular weight kininogen. Using
the amino acid count according to Nakanishi, which includes the signal
peptide, Kunapuli (1993) determined that the amino acid altered was
arg196.

HIGH MOLECULAR WEIGHT KININOGEN DEFICIENCY
KNG1, 1-BP DEL, 1492A

Krijanovski et al. (2003) described studies of the plasma and DNA of a
6-year-old male, born of first-cousin parents, with cerebral artery
thrombosis and HMWK deficiency (228960). The previously healthy child
had headache and vomiting 10 days after moderate cerebral trauma,
followed by loss of consciousness and subsequent visual impairment. CT
scan and angiography showed extensive left vertebral-basilar artery
thrombosis and a left vertebral artery dissection. The patient had a
prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and received
fresh frozen plasma before arteriography and then daily for 8 days,
which resulted in normalization of the APTT and resolution of neurologic
symptoms. There was full neurologic recovery with warfarin anticoagulant
therapy for 6 months, and there had been no recurrence after 2 years of
follow-up. The child had no high molecular weight kininogen procoagulant
activity and antigen (less than 1%). He was found to be homozygous for
deletion of an adenine at cDNA position 1492 in exon 10 of the KNG1
gene, corresponding to position 480 of the mature protein. The mutation
resulted in a frameshift and premature termination at amino acid 532 of
the mature protein. Each parent and a sib were heterozygous for the same
defect. Krijanovski et al. (2003) found that truncation or frameshift at
or before position 480 of mature HMWK prevented biosynthesis,
processing, and/or secretion of the protein into plasma.

HIGH MOLECULAR WEIGHT KININOGEN DEFICIENCY
KNG1, 17-BP DEL/17-BP INS, NT1559

The first plasma with HMWK deficiency (228960) to be recognized was
derived from an African American of the surname Fitzgerald (Waldmann et
al., 1975). Studying DNA prepared from a more that 25-year-old frozen
plasma specimen, Krijanovski et al. (2003) determined that the KNG1
defect in Fitzgerald trait resides in intron 9, with substitution of 17
consecutive basepairs at nucleotides 1559 through 1575. The substituted
segment had 1559T and 1575A at its 2 ends and consisted of 5 TGT
triplets, which in Fitzgerald DNA were changed to 5 GTG triplets, the
end nucleotides being changed to 1559G and 1575G. Also at nucleotide
position 1578, a GT sequence in normal DNA was changed to TG in
Fitzgerald intron 9. Furthermore, in Fitzgerald intron 9, single
basepair polymorphisms were found at nucleotide positions 119 (C to T),
1586 (T to G), and 1736 (A to G).

HIGH MOLECULAR WEIGHT KININOGEN DEFICIENCY
KNG1, 1-BP INS, 1217C

Using restriction analysis, Hayashi et al. (1990) found that a Japanese
patient with isolated HMWK deficiency (228960) had a partial deletion in
intron 7 of the KNG1 gene. This partial deletion was assumed to be
related to an abnormality of alternative splicing of HMW prekininogen
mRNA. However, Shigekiyo et al. (2007) found that this patient with
isolated HMWK deficiency was homozygous for a 1-bp insertion (C) at
nucleotide 1217 in exon 10 of the KNG1 gene. The insertion resulted in a
frameshift in codon 406 and a premature stop signal in codon 415. The
patient's brother and parents, who were second cousins, were
heterozygous for the mutation.

606203	TITLE *606203 GRB2-ASSOCIATED BINDING PROTEIN 2; GAB2
;;KIAA0571
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The GAB2 gene encodes an adaptor molecule that is the principal
activator of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PIK3; see 171833) in
response to activation of the high-affinity IgE receptor (see 147140)
(Gu et al., 2001).

CLONING

Nishida et al. (1999) identified GAB2 as a 100-kD adaptor molecule
(pp100) interacting with SHP2 (176876) and PI3 kinase in response to
various stimuli. The human GAB2 gene encodes a 676-amino acid protein
with a pleckstrin homology domain, proline-rich sequences, and tyrosine
residues that bind to SH2 domains when they are phosphorylated.

Zhao et al. (1999) identified a human adaptor molecule containing a
pleckstrin homology domain at the N terminus that is closely related to
GAB1 (604439) and Drosophila 'daughter of sevenless' (Dos). Zhao et al.
(1999) called this protein GAB2. Northern blot analysis indicated that
GAB2 is widely expressed and has an overlapping but distinctive
expression pattern as compared with that of GAB1, with high levels of
GAB2 mRNA detected in the heart, brain, placenta, spleen, ovary,
peripheral blood leukocytes, and spinal cord.

Nishida et al. (1999) and Zhao et al. (1999) identified cDNA KIAA0571
(Nagase et al., 1998) as GAB2. Nagase et al. (1998) reported the high
homology of GAB2 with GAB1 (34.2% amino acid identity).

GENE FUNCTION

Nishida et al. (1999) showed that tyrosine phosphorylation of GAB2 is
induced by stimulation through gp130 (IL6ST; 600694), IL2R (147730),
IL3R (308385), TPOR (159530), SCFR (164920), and TCR (see 186880). The
authors showed GAB1 and GAB2 to be substrates for SHP2 in vitro.

Zhao et al. (1999) demonstrated that upon tyrosine phosphorylation, GAB2
physically interacts with SHP2 tyrosine phosphatase and GRB2 adaptor
protein (604330). GAB2 has an inhibitory effect on the activation of
ELK1 (311040)-dependent transcription triggered by a dominant active Ras
(190020) mutant or under growth factor stimulation, whereas GAB1 acts to
potentiate slightly the ELK1 activity in the same system. In contrast to
the reciprocal effects of GAB1 and GAB2 in mediating ELK1 induction,
these 2 molecules have a similar function in extracellular
signal-regulated kinase activation induced by either oncogenic Ras or
growth factor stimulation. Zhao et al. (1999) concluded that GAB1 and
GAB2 may have distinct roles in coupling cytoplasmic-nuclear signal
transduction.

Wada et al. (2005) determined that GAB2 has a role in osteoclast
differentiation. GAB2 interacted with the C-terminal domain of RANK
(603499) and mediated differentiation through a signaling pathway that
included NFKB (see 164011), AKT (see AKT1; 164730), and JNK (see MAPK8;
601158).

The scaffolding adaptor GAB2 maps to 11q13.4-q13.5, a region commonly
amplified in human breast cancer, and is overexpressed in breast cancer
cell lines and primary tumors. Bentires-Alj et al. (2006) found that
overexpression of GAB2 increases proliferation of MCF10A mammary cells
in 3-dimensional culture. Coexpression of GAB2 with antiapoptotic
oncogenes caused luminal filling, whereas coexpression with NEU (also
known as ERBB2 and HER2; 164870) resulted in an invasive phenotype.
These effects of GAB2 were mediated by hyperactivation of the SHP2-ERK
pathway. Furthermore, overexpression of Gab2 potentiated, whereas
deficiency of Gab2 ameliorated, Neu-evoked breast carcinogenesis in
mice. Finally, Bentires-Alj et al. (2006) found that GAB2 is amplified
in some GAB2-overexpressing human breast tumors. Their data suggested
that GAB2 may be a key gene within an 11q13 amplicon in human breast
cancer and proposed a role for overexpression of GAB2 in mammary
carcinogenesis. The authors suggested that agents that target GAB2 or
GAB2-dependent pathways may be useful for treating breast tumors that
overexpress GAB2 or HER2 or both.

MAPPING

Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the GAB2 gene to chromosome 11 using a
radiation hybrid panel. By FISH, Yamada et al. (2001) mapped the GAB2
gene to human chromosome 11q13.4-q13.5 and mouse chromosome 7E2.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Reiman et al. (2007) used a genomewide SNP survey to examine 1,411
individuals with late-onset Alzheimer disease (AD; 104300) and controls,
including 644 carriers of the APOE (107741) E4 allele and 767
noncarriers. The authors found a significant association between AD and
6 SNPs in the GAB2 gene that are part of a common haplotype block.
Maximal significance of the association was at dbSNP rs2373115 with an
odds ratio of 4.06 (uncorrected p value of 9 x 10(-11)). Carriers of the
APOE4 alleles had an even higher disease risk when the SNP risk allele
was present (odds ratio of 24.64) compared to noncarriers.
Neuropathologic studies found that GAB2 was overexpressed in neurons
from AD patients, and the protein was detected in neurons,
tangle-bearing neurons, and dystrophic neurites.

In contrast to the findings of Reiman et al. (2007), both Chapuis et al.
(2008) and Miyashita et al. (2009) failed to detect an association
between dbSNP rs2373115 and risk of developing AD in Caucasian and
Japanese individuals, respectively. Chapuis et al. (2008) studied 3
European Caucasian populations totaling 1,749 AD cases and 1,406
controls, and Miyashita et al. (2009) studied 1,656 Japanese cases and
1,656 Japanese controls; they suggested that GAB2 is, at best, a minor
disease susceptibility gene for AD.

ANIMAL MODEL

Gu et al. (2001) generated mice deficient in Gab2 by homologous
recombination. Gab2 -/- mice were viable and generally healthy; however,
the response of Gab2 -/- mast cells to stimulation of the high affinity
IgE receptor Fc-epsilon-RI (see 147140) was defective. Accordingly,
allergic reactions, such as passive cutaneous and systemic anaphylaxis,
were markedly impaired in Gab -/- mice. Biochemical analyses revealed
that signaling pathways dependent on phosphatidylinositol-3
hydroxykinase (PI3K), a critical component of the Fc-epsilon-RI
signaling, were defective in Gab2 -/- mast cells. Gu et al. (2001)
concluded that GAB2 is the principal activator of PI3K in response to
Fc-epsilon-RI activation, thereby providing genetic evidence that
Dos/Gab family scaffolds regulate the PI3K pathway in vivo.

Wada et al. (2005) found that the bone marrow of Gab2 -/- mice showed
reduced cellularity, and they observed a significant increase in bone
mass in Gab2 -/- mice. Wada et al. (2005) determined that Gab2
deficiency led to decreased bone resorption due to defective osteoclast
differentiation.

molecular mass of 5.0 kD and shares 76% identity over its length with
the much longer ING1 protein. RT-PCR detected ING2 expression in all
normal tissues tested and in some cancer cell lines.

601540	TITLE *601540 BROMODOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 2; BRD2
;;FEMALE STERILE HOMEOTIC-RELATED GENE 1, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF; FSRG1;;
RING3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

BRD2 is a putative nuclear transcriptional regulator and a member of a
family of genes that are expressed during development.

CLONING

In a search for novel genes in the human major histocompatibility
complex (MHC) class II region on chromosome 6p21.3, Okamoto et al.
(1991) and Beck et al. (1992) identified a gene that they termed RING3.
('RING' is an acronym for 'really interesting new gene.') Based on
mapping and genomic sequencing, RING3 was located in the middle of the
class II region between the genes HLA-DNA (142930) and HLA-DMA (142855).
In contrast to all the other genes encoded in the class II region, RING3
appeared to have no obvious function associated with the immune system
based on sequence comparisons. The striking sequence similarity to the
female sterile homeotic (fsh) gene in Drosophila, however, suggested a
conserved biologic function for RING3.

Denis and Green (1996) discovered that the RING3 product is, in fact, a
mitogen-activated nuclear kinase involved in signal transduction and
that it is upregulated in certain types of leukemia.

With the aim of learning more about the phylogeny of RING3, Thorpe et
al. (1996) identified further homologs in different species and
determined their gene structures. The functional analysis of RING3 had
been further complicated by the finding of a second, non-MHC-linked copy
of RING3 in humans by Nomura et al. (1994). This was referred to by them
as ORFX (601541).

GENE FUNCTION

Dawson et al. (2011) demonstrated that I-BET151, a novel small molecule
inhibitor of the BET family, of which BRD2 is a member, has profound
efficacy against human and murine MLL-fusion leukemia cell lines through
the induction of early cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. I-BET151
treatment in 2 human leukemia cell lines with different MLL fusions
altered the expression of a common set of genes whose function may
account for these phenotypic changes. The mode of action of I-BET151 is,
at least in part, due to the inhibition of transcription at key genes
BCL2 (151430), C-MYC (190080), and CDK6 (603368) through the
displacement of BRD3/4, PAFc, and SEC components from chromatin. In vivo
studies indicated that I-BET151 has significant therapeutic value,
providing survival benefit in 2 distinct mouse models of murine MLL-AF9
and human MLL-AF4 leukemia.

gene and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, see EJM3 (608816).

604374	TITLE *604374 METALLOTHIONEIN-LIKE 5, TESTIS-SPECIFIC; MTL5
;;TESTIS-SPECIFIC METALLOTHIONEIN-LIKE PROTEIN; TESMIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By randomized RT-PCR on mRNA from mouse tissues, Sugihara et al. (1999)
isolated a testis-specific transcript, which they called TF1. By
screening a human testis cDNA library with TF1 as a probe, they cloned a
novel cDNA, which they called testis-specific metallothionein-like
protein, or tesmin. Tesmin encodes a predicted cysteine-rich, 295-amino
acid protein that is 76.3% homologous to mouse tesmin. Sequence analysis
revealed the presence of 2 metallothionein (MT)-like motifs. MT
expression has been observed to be higher in testes than in liver tissue
(Salehi-Ashtiani et al., 1993) and to be actively expressed in a
developmentally regulated fashion in mouse male germ cells (De et al.,
1991). Tesmin shows no homology to other testis-specific genes. In situ
hybridization of adult mouse testicular sections showed that expression
of tesmin is restricted to spermatocytes. RT-PCR analysis on testicular
transcripts from mice showed that expression of tesmin occurs as early
as day 8 and coincides with the entry of germ cells in meiosis.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Sugihara et al. (1999) mapped the
MTL5 gene to human chromosome 11q13.2-q13.3 and mouse chromosome 19B.

607283	TITLE *607283 LSM3 PROTEIN; LSM3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Sm-like proteins were identified in a variety of organisms based on
sequence homology with the Sm protein family (see SNRPD2; 601061).
Sm-like proteins contain the Sm sequence motif, which consists of 2
regions separated by a linker of variable length that folds as a loop.
The Sm-like proteins are thought to form a stable heteromer present in
tri-snRNP particles, which are important for pre-mRNA splicing.

CLONING

In a search for human Sm-like proteins, Achsel et al. (1999)
fractionated proteins present in purified (U4/U6.U5) tri-snRNPs and
isolated 7 Sm-like proteins, which they named LSm2-LSm8. Using partial
peptide sequence for database searches, they identified and sequenced
EST clones. Using additional sequence obtained by PCR amplification of a
HeLa cDNA library, they assembled full-length cDNA sequences for
LSM2-LSM8.

Salgado-Garrido et al. (1999) searched database sequence for Sm proteins
and identified 16 potential Sm-related genes in yeast as well as some
Sm-related genes in human and archaebacteria. Using a multiple sequence
alignment of Sm domains, they built a phylogenetic tree of yeast, human,
and archaeal Sm and Sm-like proteins.

GENE FUNCTION

Using electron-microscopy, Achsel et al. (1999) observed that purified
LSm proteins form a heteromer that is stable even in the absence of RNA
and exhibits a doughnut-shaped structure similar to the Sm core RNP
structure. They demonstrated that the purified LSm heteromer binds
specifically to the U6 snRNA at its 3-prime-terminal U-tract. They also
showed that the LSm proteins facilitate the formation of U4/U6 RNA
duplexes in vitro and concluded that the LSm proteins may play a role in
U4/U6 snRNP formation.

Using immunoprecipitation experiments, Salgado-Garrido et al. (1999)
concluded that there is a complex of 7 Sm-like proteins bound to RNA in
yeast. Lsm2-Lsm8 coprecipitate the U4, U5 and U6 snRNAs and directly
associate with the U6 snRNA present in the free U6 snRNP. Additionally,
the yeast Lsm2-Lsm7 proteins were found to be associated with the
pre-RNase P RNA but not the mature RNase RNA. Using immunoprecipitation
experiments from human cell extracts, Salgado-Garrido et al. (1999)
showed that the LSM3 and LSM4 proteins are specifically associated with
snRNP complexes containing the U6 snRNA. Salgado-Garrido et al. (1999)
concluded that Sm and Sm-like proteins assemble in at least 2
functionally conserved complexes of deep evolutionary origin.

By disrupting the Sm and Sm-like genes in yeast, Salgado-Garrido et al.
(1999) concluded that disruption of genes encoding Sm-like proteins
directly associated with the U6 snRNA (Lsm2-8) generated variable
phenotypes. Lsm2, Lsm3, Lsm4, and Lsm8 are essential for vegetative
growth. Lsm5, Lsm6, and Lsm7 are not essential for growth; however,
their disruptions lead to slow growth especially at elevated
temperature. The levels of the U6 snRNA were strongly reduced in the
strains harboring the Lsm5, Lsm6, and Lsm7 disruptions. Lsm1 and Lsm9
are dispensable for vegetative growth, but Lsm1 is required for optimal
vegetative growth at 30 degrees and is temperature sensitive.

Ingelfinger et al. (2002) determined that human LSM1 to LSM7, but not
LSM8, were expressed in HeLa cells within cytoplasmic foci. The foci
also contained a decapping enzyme (DCP1/2) and the exonuclease XRN1
(607994). Coexpression of wildtype and mutant LSM proteins, as well as
fluorescence resonance energy transfer, indicated that the LSM proteins
form a complex similar to one found in yeast. Ingelfinger et al. (2002)
concluded that the foci contain a partially or fully assembled machinery
for the degradation of mRNA.

MAPPING

Scott (2002) mapped the LSM3 gene to chromosome 3p25.1 based on sequence
similarity between the LSM3 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF182289) and a
genomic contig (GenBank GENBANK AC021022).

612905	TITLE *612905 LIPOCALIN 12; LCN12
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the lipocalin family, such as LCN12, have a common structure
consisting of an 8-stranded antiparallel beta-barrel that forms a
cup-shaped ligand-binding pocket or calyx. Lipocalins generally bind
small hydrophobic ligands and transport them to specific cells (Suzuki
et al., 2004).

CLONING

Suzuki et al. (2004) cloned mouse Lcn12, which encodes a deduced
193-amino acid protein. They identified human LCN12 by database
analysis. Northern blot analysis detected Lcn12 expression in mouse
epididymis only. Lcn12 expression was detected in mouse epididymis at
all postnatal ages examined, with increased expression at 3 weeks of
age.

GENE FUNCTION

Suzuki et al. (2004) found that expression of Lcn12 in mouse epididymis
decreased after castration and was restored by testosterone
administration.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Suzuki et al. (2004) mapped the LCN12 gene
to an LCN gene cluster on chromosome 9q34. They mapped the mouse Lcn12
gene to a syntenic region of mouse chromosome 2A3.

607803	TITLE *607803 CYCLIN M2; CNNM2
;;ANCIENT CONSERVED DOMAIN PROTEIN 2; ACDP2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By positional cloning in the urofacial syndrome (UFS; 236730) critical
region on chromosome 10q23-q24, Wang et al. (2003) cloned a gene (CNNM1;
607802) encoding a protein with strong amino acid sequence homology to
EST clusters derived from different chromosomes. Using these clusters as
starting points, they cloned 4 genes belonging to a novel family, which
they designated ACDP (ancient conserved domain protein) because all 4
deduced proteins share a domain (ACD) conserved in a large number of
species from bacteria to man. In addition, all 4 contain a 31-amino acid
sequence motif that is present in the cyclin box, a cyclic
nucleotide-monophosphate (cNMP)-binding domain, and 2 CBS domains. The
ACDP2 gene, designated CNNM2 by the HUGO Nomenclature Committee, encodes
a deduced 875-amino acid protein. Northern blot analysis revealed
ubiquitous expression of CNNM2. Immunofluorescence studies showed that
all 4 CNMM proteins are predominantly localized in the nucleus.

Wang et al. (2004) cloned a mouse Acdp2 encoding a deduced 874-amino
acid protein that shares 97% identity with human ACDP2. Acdp2 contains 4
transmembrane domains, 2 CBS domains, a DUF21 domain, and a cNMP-binding
domain. It also has a glycine-rich region. Northern blot analysis of
mouse tissues detected Acdp2 in brain, kidney, and liver.

Goytain and Quamme (2005) cloned a mouse Acdp2 encoding a deduced
693-amino acid protein. Acdp2 contains 4 transmembrane regions and
possible sites for N-glycosylation and phosphorylation. RT-PCR detected
highest Acdp2 expression in kidney and brain, with lower amounts in all
other tissues examined.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Wang et al. (2003) mapped the CNNM2 gene
to chromosome 10q24-q26, between markers D10S222 and SGC31986.

By genomic sequence analysis, Goytain and Quamme (2005) mapped the CNNM2
gene to chromosome 10q24.33. They mapped the mouse Cnnm2 gene to
chromosome 19C3.

GENE FUNCTION

Using real-time RT-PCR, Goytain and Quamme (2005) found that expression
of Acdp2 increased in mouse distal convoluted tubule cells cultured in
low magnesium media relative to normal media and in kidney cortex and
heart of mice maintained on low magnesium diets compared with those on
normal diets. Expression of Acdp2 in Xenopus oocytes mediated saturable
Mg(2+) uptake that was rheogenic, voltage dependent, and not coupled to
Na+ or Cl-. Acdp2 transported Mg(2+), Co(2+), Mn(2+), Sr(2+), Ba(2+),
Cu(2+), and Fe(2+). No currents were induced by Ca(2+), Cd(2+), Zn(2+),
or Ni(2+), and only Zn(2+) inhibited transport.

By immunohistochemical analysis of mouse and human kidney sections,
Stuiver et al. (2011) demonstrated expression of CNNM2 in both the thick
ascending limb of the Henle loop and the distal collecting tubule (DCT),
with a consistently basolateral staining pattern. In mouse DCT cells,
there was significant (2.7-fold) upregulation of Cnnm2 transcripts in
cells grown under low Mg(2+) compared to control conditions, whereas low
Ca(2+) had no significant effect on Cnnm2 mRNA levels. Patch-clamp
studies in transiently transfected HEK293 cells revealed that CNNM2
mediates Mg(2+)-sensitive Na(+) currents that are blocked by increased
extracellular Mg(2+) concentrations.

For discussion of a possible association between variation in the CNNM2
gene and intracranial berry aneurysm, see ANIB1 (105800).

- Renal Hypomagnesemia 6

In affected individuals from a Dutch and a Czech family segregating
autosomal dominant renal hypomagnesemia (HOMG6; 613882) Stuiver et al.
(2011) analyzed the candidate gene CNNM2 and identified heterozygosity
for a 1-bp deletion (607803.0001) and a missense mutation (607803.0002),
respectively. Electrophysiologic analysis showed that CNNM2-mediated
Mg(2+)-sensitive Na(+) currents were significantly diminished with the
missense protein compared to wildtype.

CNNM2, 1-BP DEL, 117G

In a Dutch father and daughter with renal hypomagnesemia (HOMG6;

deletion (117delG) in the CNNM2 gene, causing a frameshift and premature
stop codon that results in a truncated 53-amino acid protein. The
mutation was not found in 202 ethnically matched chromosomes.

In a mother and son from the Czech Republic with renal hypomagnesemia
(HOMG6; 613882), Stuiver et al. (2011) identified heterozygosity for a
1703C-T transition in the CNNM2 gene, resulting in a thr568-to-ile
(T568I) substitution at a highly conserved residue in the ancient
conserved domain. The mutation was not found in 214 ethnically matched
chromosomes. Patch-clamp studies in transiently transfected HEK293 cells
showed that CNNM2-mediated Mg(2+)-sensitive Na(+) currents were
significantly diminished with mutant protein compared to wildtype.

601404	TITLE *601404 G PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTOR 68; GPR68
;;OVARIAN CANCER G PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTOR 1; OGR1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Xu and Casey (1996) described a gene encoding a member of the G
protein-coupled receptors that they termed ovarian cancer G
protein-coupled receptor-1 (OGR1). It was isolated by degenerate PCR
from an ovarian cell line cDNA library. The 365-amino acid predicted
protein contains 7 hydrophobic transmembrane domains and is 54%
identical to the human orphan receptor GPR4 (600551). Xu and Casey
(1996) detected an approximately 3-kb transcript in a variety of
tissues, including spleen, testis, peripheral blood leukocytes, brain,
lung, and placenta. Its expression was lower in other tissues and
undetectable in some, including ovary.

Ludwig et al. (2003) demonstrated that OGR1, which had previously been
described as a receptor for sphingosylphosphorylcholine, acts as a
proton-sensing receptor stimulating inositol phosphate formation. The
receptor is inactive at pH 7.8 and fully activated at pH 6.8.
Site-directed mutagenesis showed that histidines at the extracellular
surface are involved in pH sensing. These include histidines 17, 20, 84,
269, and 169. Mutation of these amino acids resulted in receptors that
failed to stimulate inositol phosphate formation at pH 6.8 but on
exposure to more acidic pH activity, could be restored. Ludwig et al.
(2003) found that GPR4, a close relative of OGR1, also responds to pH
changes but elicits cAMP formation. They noted that the skeleton
participates in pH homeostasis as a buffering organ and that osteoblasts
respond to pH changes in the physiologic range; their findings suggested
that OGR1 represents an osteoblastic pH sensor regulating cell-mediated
responses to acidosis in bone. They found expression of OGR1 in
osteosarcoma cells and primary human osteoblast precursors, and
demonstrated that these cells exhibit strong pH-dependent inositol
phosphate formation. Immunohistochemistry on rat tissue sections
confirmed the presence of OGR1 in osteoblasts and osteocytes. Ludwig et
al. (2003) proposed that OGR1 and GPR4 are proton-sensing receptors
involved in pH homeostasis.

MAPPING

Xu and Casey (1996) mapped the OGR1 gene to chromosome 14 using a panel
of somatic cell hybrid DNAs and localized it to 14q31 by FISH.

614282	TITLE *614282 STROMAL CELL-DERIVED FACTOR 4; SDF4
;;CALCIUM-BINDING PROTEIN, 45-KD; CAB45
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Scherer et al. (1996) cloned 2 splice variants of mouse Sdf4, which they
called Cab45. The transcripts differ in their 5-prime UTRs and encode
the same 361-amino acid protein. Cab45 has an N-terminal signal
sequence, followed by an N-glycosylation site and 6 EF hands
characteristic of calcium-binding proteins. Cab45 shares significant
sequence similarity with the endoplasmic reticulum-resident
calcium-binding proteins reticulocalbin (RCN1; 602735) and Erc55 (RCN2;
602584). Northern blot analysis detected variable Cab45 expression in
all mouse tissues examined. Pulse-chase, endoglycosidase H resistance,
and brefeldin-A experiments and immunofluorescence microscopy revealed
that Cab45 was a glycosylated, soluble, postmedial Golgi-resident
protein.

Koivu et al. (1997) cloned human CAB45 from a lymphocyte cDNA library.
The deduced 362-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of
41.8 kD and shares 87% identity with mouse Cab45. Northern blot analysis
detected variable CAB45 expression in all 8 human tissues examined.

GENE FUNCTION

Using an overlay assay, Scherer et al. (1996) found that mouse Cab45
showed significant binding of radiolabeled calcium.

Zhu et al. (2008) showed that expression of Cab45 was downregulated
during differentiation in cultured rat PC12 cells and rat cerebellum.
Cab45 expression was also downregulated by ethanol in mouse fibroblasts.
Knockdown of Cab45 in PC12 cells exacerbated the antiproliferative
effect of ultraviolet exposure.

MAPPING

Hartz (2011) mapped the SDF4 gene to chromosome 1p36.33 based on an
alignment of the SDF4 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF153686) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

605213	TITLE *605213 3-@PHOSPHOINOSITIDE-DEPENDENT PROTEIN KINASE 1; PDPK1
;;PDK1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Isoforms of protein kinase B (PKB, or AKT1; 164730) are overexpressed in
some ovarian, pancreatic, and breast cancer cells, and PKB has been
shown to protect cells from apoptosis. Activation of PKB, which is
preventable by inhibitors of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (see PIK3CG;
601232), is stimulated by insulin or growth factors after
phosphorylation of PKB at thr308 and ser473. Alessi et al. (1997)
biochemically purified a protein kinase, which they called PDK1, that
phosphorylates PKB at thr308 in response to phosphatidylinositol
3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) or phosphatidylinositol
3,4-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4)P2) and enhances PKB activity. By
microsequence analysis of the approximately 67- to 69-kD PDK1 protein,
searching an EST database, and probing a breast cancer cell line cDNA
library, Alessi et al. (1997) isolated a cDNA encoding PDK1, also called
PDPK1. Sequence analysis predicted that the 556-amino acid PDPK1 protein
contains a catalytic domain with 11 classic kinase subdomains and a
C-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain.

GENE FUNCTION

Alessi et al. (1997) found that expression of recombinant PDPK1 resulted
in the activation and phosphorylation of PKB at thr308 in a
PtdIns(3,4,5)P3- or PtdIns(3,4)P2-dependent manner via the PH domains.

Stephens et al. (1998) demonstrated that PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and
PtdIns(3,4)P2 bind to the PH domains of PKB and PDPK1, causing their
translocation to the membrane and leading to PKB activation.

Pullen et al. (1998) showed that PDPK1 selectively phosphorylates the
70-kD ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70-RPS6K) at thr229, which is
required for its activation. Thr229 of p70-RPS6K is homologous to thr308
of the PKB protein.

Using transfected HEK293 cells stimulated with pervanadate or insulin,
Park et al. (2001) found that PDK1 becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated and
translocates to the plasma membrane. Following pervanadate treatment,
PDK1 kinase activity increased 1.5- to 3-fold, whereas the activity of
PDK1 associated with the plasma membrane increased approximately 6-fold.
The activity localized to the plasma membrane was also increased by
insulin treatment. Using site-directed mutants, they determined that
phosphorylation of tyr373/tyr376 is important for PDK1 activity.

Activation of the transcription factor NF-kappa-B (see 164011) after
engagement of the T cell receptor (TCR) is important for T cell
proliferation and activation during the adaptive immune response. Lee et
al. (2005) demonstrated that PDK1 has an essential role in this pathway
by regulating the activation of PKC-theta (PRKCQ; 600448) and through
signal-dependent recruiting of both PKC-theta and CARD11 (607210) to
lipid rafts. PDK1-associated PKC-theta recruits the IKK complex, whereas
PDK1-associated CARD11 recruits the Bcl10-MALT1 complex (see 604860),
thereby allowing activation of the IKK complex through
Bcl10-MALT1-dependent ubiquitination of the IKK complex subunit NEMO
(300248). Lee et al. (2005) concluded that PDK1 plays a critical role by
nucleating the TCR-induced NF-kappa-B activation pathway in T cells.

Gruber et al. (2006) commented on the study of Lee et al. (2005),
stating they observed that PKC-theta is phosphorylated on the activation
loop at thr538 before T cell activation. The results of Gruber et al.
(2006) are therefore inconsistent with the conclusions of Lee et al.
(2005) that thr538 phosphorylation of PKC-theta is regulated by T-cell
receptor activation. They postulated that other mechanisms, such as
autophosphorylation of thr219, might orchestrate the cellular function
of PKC-theta in T cells. Lee et al. (2006) responded to the comments of
Gruber et al. (2006) to state that several other groups have replicated
their data regarding inducible phosphorylation of thr538 in T cells. Lee
et al. (2006) noted that although the physiologic relevance of the
discrepancy is unclear, substantial differences and experimental
conditions and reagents may have accounted for the conflicting
observations.

In 3-dimensional matrices, cancer cells move with a rounded, amoeboid
morphology that is controlled by ROCK1-dependent contraction of
actomyosin. Using human cancer cell lines, Pinner and Sahai (2008)
showed that PDK1 was required for phosphorylation of myosin light chain
(see 160780) and cell motility, both on deformable gels and in vivo.
Depletion of PDK1 via RNA interference altered the localization of ROCK1
and reduced its ability to drive cortical actomyosin contraction. This
form of ROCK1 regulation did not require PDK1 kinase activity. Instead,
PDK1 competed directly with RHOE (RND3; 602924) for binding to ROCK1 and
opposed inhibition of ROCK1 by RHOE.

MAPPING

Alessi et al. (1997) and Stephens et al. (1998) mapped the PDPK1 gene to
16p13.3 based on its identity to a sequence located in the same region
as the PKD1 (601313) and TSC2 (191092) loci (Burn et al., 1996).

ANIMAL MODEL

Lawlor et al. (2002) found that Pdk1-null mice died at embryonic day 9.5
with multiple abnormalities, including lack of somites, forebrain, and
neural crest-derived tissues. Development of hind- and midbrain,
however, proceeded relatively normally. Lawlor et al. (2002) developed a
mouse strain that showed reduced levels of Pdk1 activity. These
hypomorphic Pdk1 mice were viable and fertile, and insulin injection
induced the normal phosphorylation responses attributed to Pdk1
activation. Nevertheless, these mice were 40 to 50% smaller than control
animals. The organ volumes from the Pdk1 hypomorphic mice were reduced
proportionally, and the volume of a number of Pdk1-deficient cells was
reduced by 35 to 60%. Pdk1 deficiency seemed to regulate cell size
directly and independently of cell number or proliferation rate.

The PDK1 'master kinase' mediates activation of AGC serine kinases (PKA,
PKG, and PKC (see 176960)) by phosphorylating them at the 'T-loop' site
of their catalytic domains. In order to determine the role of AGC serine
kinases in T-cell development, Hinton et al. (2004) used conditional
gene deletion of Pdk1 in mouse T cells to avoid embryonic lethality.
Complete loss of Pdk1 blocked T-cell differentiation in thymus, whereas
reducing Pdk1 activity to 10% of normal allowed differentiation to
proceed but blocked thymic expansion.

Hashimoto et al. (2006) investigated the role of PDK1, a
serine-threonine kinase, in regulating islet mass via a signaling
pathway that includes INSR (147670) or IGF1R (147370), IRS1 (147545),
and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). Hashimoto et al. (2006) showed
that mice lacking Pdk1 specifically in pancreatic beta cells developed
progressive hyperglycemia as a result of loss of islet mass. The mice
showed reductions in islet density as well as in number and size of beta
cells. Haploinsufficiency of the Foxo1 gene (136533) resulted in a
marked increase in the number, but not the size, of beta cells and
resulted in restoration of glucose homeostasis in beta cell-specific
Pdk1-null mice. Hashimoto et al. (2006) suggested that PDK1 is important
in maintenance of pancreatic beta cell mass and glucose homeostasis.

In mice lacking Pdk1 in oocytes, Reddy et al. (2009) demonstrated that
the majority of primordial follicles were depleted around the onset of
sexual maturity, causing premature ovarian failure (POF) during early
adulthood. Suppressed PDK1-Akt1 (164730)-S6K1 (RPS6KB1; 608938)-RPS6
(180460) signaling in oocytes appeared to be responsible for the loss of
primordial follicles, and mice lacking the Rps6 gene in oocytes showed
POF similar to that in Pdk1-deficient mice. Reddy et al. (2009)
concluded that the PI3K/PTEN (601728)-PDK1 signaling pathway in oocytes
controls the survival, loss, and activation of primordial follicles
(which together determine reproductive aging and the length of
reproductive life in females), and that underactivation or
overactivation of the pathway in oocytes may cause POF and infertility.

614625	TITLE *614625 DIFFERENTIATION-ANTAGONIZING NONCODING RNA; DANCR
;;ANTI-DIFFERENTIATION NONCODING RNA; ANCR;;
KIAA0114
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated KG-1 immature
myeloid cell line, Nagase et al. (1995) cloned DANCR, which they
designated KIAA0114. Northern blot analysis detected variable DANCR
expression in all human tissues and cell lines examined, with highest
expression in heart, skeletal muscle, and kidney.

By sequencing long noncoding RNAs expressed in undifferentiated human
epidermal progenitor cells, Kretz et al. (2012) cloned DANCR, which they
called ANCR. The mature transcript is 855 bases long. ANCR was variably
expressed in several primary human cell cultures and cell lines, with
highest expression in embryonic stem cells and K562 leukemia cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Kretz et al. (2012) found that ANCR expression was downregulated upon
terminal differentiation in cultured human keratinocytes, adipocytes,
and osteoblasts.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kretz et al. (2012) determined that the DANCR gene contains 3 exons and
harbors the genes for MIR4449 (614627) and SNORA26 (614626) in introns 1
and 2, respectively.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1995) mapped the DANCR gene
to chromosome 4. Hartz (2012) mapped the DANCR gene to chromosome 4q12
based on an alignment of the DANCR sequence (GenBank GENBANK D28589)
with the genomic sequence (GRCh37).

139250	TITLE *139250 GROWTH HORMONE 1; GH1
;;GH;;
GROWTH HORMONE, NORMAL; GHN;;
GROWTH HORMONE, PITUITARY
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Growth hormone (GH) is synthesized by acidophilic or somatotropic cells
of the anterior pituitary gland. Human growth hormone has a molecular
mass of 22,005 and contains 191 amino acid residues with 2 disulfide
bridges (Niall et al., 1971).

CLONING

By 1977, not only had the amino acid sequence of GH been determined, but
the sequence of nucleotides in the structural gene for GH had been
determined as well (Baxter et al., 1977).

By molecular cloning of cDNA, Masuda et al. (1988) demonstrated that the
20-kD variant of human GH is produced by the same gene (GHN or GH1) as
the 22-kD form, and that a process of alternative splicing is involved.

Chen et al. (1989) sequenced the entire 66,500 bp of the GH gene
cluster. The expression of the 5 genes in this cluster was examined by
screening pituitary and placenta cDNA libraries, using gene-specific
oligonucleotides. According to this analysis, the GHN gene is
transcribed exclusively in the pituitary, whereas the other 4 genes
(CSL, 603515; CSA, 150200; GHV, 139240; and CSB, 118820) are expressed
only in placental tissues. The CSL gene carries a G-to-A transition in a
sequence used by the other 4 genes as an intronic 5-prime splice donor
site. The mutation results in a different splicing pattern and, hence,
in a novel sequence of the CSL gene mRNA and the deduced polypeptide.

GH and CSH (CSA) have 191 amino acid residues and show about 85%
homology in amino acid sequence (Owerbach et al., 1980). Their messenger
RNAs have more than 90% homology.

GENE FUNCTION

Human GH binds 2 GHR (600946) molecules and induces signal transduction
through receptor dimerization. Sundstrom et al. (1996) noted that at
high concentrations, GH acts as an antagonist because of a large
difference in affinities at the respective binding sites. This
antagonist action can be enhanced further by reducing binding in the
low-affinity binding site. A possible mechanism by which mutant,
biologically inactive GH may have its effect is to act as an antagonist
to the binding of normal GH to its receptor, GHR.

The regulation of GH synthesis and release is modulated by a family of
genes that include the transcription factors PROP1 (601538) and PIT1
(173110). PROP1 and PIT1 regulate differentiation of pituitary cells
into somatotrophs, which synthesize and release GH. Genes that are
important in the release of GH include the GHRH (139190) and GHRHR
(139191) genes. After GHRH is synthesized and released from the
hypothalamus, it travels to the anterior pituitary where it binds to
GHRHR, resulting in transduction of a signal into the somatotroph which
promotes release of presynthesized GH that is stored in secretory
granules. Other gene products that are important in GH synthesis and
release are GHR and the growth hormone-binding proteins (GHBP). The
GHBPs are derived from the membrane bound receptor (GHR) and they remain
bound to GH in the circulation. Following binding of GH to 2 GHR
molecules, the signal to produce IGF1 (147440) is transduced. The GH
molecules that are bound to membrane-anchored GH receptors can be
released into the circulation by excision of the extracellular portion
of the GHR molecules. At this point, the extracellular portion of the
GHR, which is referred to as the GHBP, serves to stabilize GH in the
circulation. The final genes in the GH synthetic pathway include IGF1
and its receptor (IGF1R; 147370), whose products stimulate growth in
various tissues including bones and muscle (Phillips, 1995; Rimoin and
Phillips, 1997).

Boguszewski et al. (1997) investigated the proportion of circulating
non-22-kD GH1 isoforms in prepubertal children with short stature
(height less than -2 SD score) of different etiologies. The study groups
consisted of 17 girls with Turner syndrome (TS), aged 3 to 13 years; 25
children born small for gestational age (SGA) without postnatal catch-up
growth, aged 3 to 13 years; and 24 children with idiopathic short
stature (ISS), aged 4 to 15 years. The results were compared with those
from 23 prepubertal healthy children of normal stature (height +/- 2 SD
score), aged 4 to 13 years. Serum non-22-kD GH levels, expressed as a
percentage of the total GH concentration, were determined by the 22-kD
GH exclusion assay. The median proportion of non-22-kD GH isoforms was
8.1% in normal children; it was increased in children born SGA (9.8%; P
= 0.05) and in girls with TS (9.9%; P = 0.01), but not in children with
ISS (8.9%). In children born SGA, the proportion of non-22-kD GH
isoforms directly correlated with different estimates of spontaneous GH
secretion and inversely correlated with height SD score. The authors
concluded that the ratio of non-22-kD GH isoforms in the circulation may
have important implications for normal and abnormal growth.

Mendlewicz et al. (1999) studied the contributions of genetic and
environmental factors in the regulation of the 24-hour GH secretion. The
24-hour profile of plasma GH was obtained at 15-minute intervals in 10
pairs of monozygotic and 9 pairs of dizygotic normal male twins, aged 16
to 34 years. A major genetic effect was evidenced on GH secretion during
wakefulness (heritability estimate of 0.74) and, to a lesser extent, on
the 24-hour GH secretion. Significant genetic influences were also
identified for slow-wave sleep and height. These results suggested that
human GH secretion in young adulthood is markedly dependent on genetic
factors.

Hindmarsh et al. (1999) studied GH secretory patterns in the elderly by
constructing 24-hour serum GH profiles in 45 male and 38 female
volunteers, aged 59.4 to 73.0 years, and related patterns to IGF1,
IGFBP3 (146732), and GH-binding protein levels; body mass index; and
waist/hip ratio. There was a highly significant difference in mean
24-hour serum GH concentrations in females compared to males as a result
of significantly higher trough GH levels in females. Peak values were
not significantly different. Serum IGF1 levels were significantly higher
in males. Peak GH values were related to serum IGF1 levels, whereas
trough GH levels were not. GH was secreted with a dominant periodicity
of 200 minutes in males and 280 minutes in females. GH secretion
assessed by ApEn was more disordered in females, and increasing disorder
was associated with lower IGF1 levels. Body mass index was negatively
related to GH in both sexes. In males, trough values were the major
determinant, whereas in females, the peak value was the major
determinant. Trough GH levels were inversely related in both sexes to
waist/hip ratio and to increasing secretory disorder. These data
demonstrated a sexually dimorphic pattern of GH secretion in the
elderly.

De Groof et al. (2002) evaluated the GH/IGF1 axis and the levels of
IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs), IGFBP3 protease, glucose, insulin
(176730), and cytokines in 27 children with severe septic shock due to
meningococcal sepsis during the first 3 days after admission. The median
age was 22 months. Significant differences were found between
nonsurvivors and survivors for the levels of total IGF1, free IGF1,
IGFBP1 (146730), IGFBP3 protease activity, IL6 (147620), and TNFA
(191160). The pediatric risk of mortality score correlated significantly
with levels of IGFBP1, IGFBP3 protease activity, IL6, and TNFA and with
levels of total IGFI and free IGFI. Levels of GH and IGFBP1 were
extremely elevated in nonsurvivors, whereas total and free IGFI levels
were markedly decreased and were accompanied by high levels of the
cytokines IL6 and TNFA.

In rodents and humans there is a sexually dimorphic pattern of GH
secretion that influences the serum concentration of IGF1. Geary et al.
(2003) studied the plasma concentrations of IGF1, IGF2 (147470), IGFBP3,
and GH in cord blood taken from the offspring of 987 singleton Caucasian
pregnancies born at term and related these values to birth weight,
length, and head circumference. Cord plasma concentrations of IGF1,
IGF2, and IGFBP3 were influenced by factors related to birth size:
gestational age at delivery, mode of delivery, maternal height, and
parity of the mother. Plasma GH concentrations were inversely related to
the plasma concentrations of IGF1 and IGFBP3; 10.2% of the variability
in cord plasma IGF1 concentration and 2.7% for IGFBP3 was explained by
sex of the offspring and parity. Birth weight, length, and head
circumference measurements were greater in males than females (P less
than 0.001). Mean cord plasma concentrations of IGF1 and IGFBP3 were
significantly lower in males than females. Cord plasma GH concentrations
were higher in males than females, but no difference was noted between
the sexes for IGF2. After adjustment for gestational age, parity, and
maternal height, cord plasma concentrations of IGF1 and IGFBP3 along
with sex explained 38.0% of the variability in birth weight, 25.0% in
birth length, and 22.7% in head circumference.

Ho et al. (2002) noted that the human GH gene cluster encompasses GHN,
which is expressed primarily in pituitary somatotropes, and 4 genes,
CSA, CSB, CSL, and GHV, which are expressed specifically in
syncytiotrophoblast cells lining the placental villi. A multicomponent
locus control region (LCR) is required for transcriptional activation in
both pituitary and placenta. In addition, 2 genes overlap with the GH
LCR: SCN4A (603967) on the 5-prime end and CD79B (147245) on the 3-prime
end. Ho et al. (2002) studied mice carrying an 87-kb human transgene
encompassing the GH LCR and most of the GH gene cluster. By deleting a
fragment of the transgene, they showed that a single determinant of the
human GH LCR located 14.5 kb 5-prime to the GHN promoter has a critical,
specific, and nonredundant role in facilitating promoter trans factor
binding and activating GHN transcription. Ho et al. (2002) found that
this same determinant plays an essential role in establishing a 32-kb
acetylated domain that encompasses the entire GH LCR and the contiguous
GHN promoter. These data supported a model for long-range gene
activation via LCR-mediated targeting and extensive spreading of core
histone acetylation.

Using mice carrying the 87-kb human GH transgene, Ho et al. (2006) found
that insertion of a Pol II terminator within the GH LCR blocked
transcription of the CD79B gene adjacent to the LCR and repressed GHN
expression. However, the insertion had little effect on acetylation
within the GH locus. Selective elimination of CD79B also repressed GHN
expression. Ho et al. (2006) concluded that Pol II tracking and histone
acetylation are not linked and that transcription, but not translation,
of the CD79B gene is required for GHN expression.

In addition to expression in pituitary and placenta and functions in
growth and reproduction, prolactin (PRL; 176760), GH, and placental
lactogen (CSH1; 150200) are expressed in endothelial cells and have
angiogenic effects. Ge et al. (2007) found that BMP1 (112264) and
BMP1-like proteinases processed PRL and GH in vitro and in vivo to
produce approximately 17-kD N-terminal fragments with antiangiogenic
activity.

GENE STRUCTURE

The GH, PL (CSH1), and PRL genes contain 5 exons separated by 4 introns.
The introns occur at the same sites, supporting evolutionary homology
(Baxter, 1981). All 5 genes in the GH gene cluster are in the same
transcriptional orientation (Ho et al., 2002).

Baxter (1981) found evidence for the existence of at least 3 GH and 3
CSH, also called placental lactogen (PL), genes on chromosome 17.
Whether they are situated GH:GH:GH:PL:PL:PL or arranged
GH:PL:GH:PL:GH:PL was not clear.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Sundstrom et al. (1996) crystallized a GH antagonist mutant, gly120 to
arg, with its receptor as a 1-to-1 complex and determined the crystal
structure at 2.9-angstrom resolution. The 1-to-1 complex with the
agonist is remarkably similar to the native GHR 1-to-2 complex. A
comparison between the 2 structures revealed only minimal differences in
the conformations of the hormone or its receptor in the 2 complexes.

EVOLUTION

Owerbach et al. (1980) estimated that the GH and CSH genes diverged
about 50 to 60 million years ago, whereas the PRL and GH genes diverged
about 400 million years ago.

Human PL and human GH are more alike than are rat GH and human GH. (PL
has more growth-promoting effects than milk-producing effects.) Baxter
(1981) proposed that in evolution the prolactin gene diverged early from
the gene that was the common progenitor of the GH and PL genes.
(Placental lactogen was the official Endocrine Society designation;
Grumbach (1981) promoted the term chorionic somatomammotropin, which has
functional legitimacy.)

MAPPING

By a combination of restriction mapping and somatic cell hybridization,
Owerbach et al. (1980) assigned genes for growth hormone, chorionic
somatomammotropin (CSH), and a third growth hormone-like gene (GH2;
139240) to the growth hormone gene cluster that is assigned to
chromosome 17.

Lebo (1980) corroborated the assignment of the GH gene to chromosome 17
by the technique of fluorescence-activated chromosome sorting. George et
al. (1981) assigned the genes for GH and CSH to the 17q21-qter region.

Ruddle (1982) found that the GH family of genes is between galactokinase
(604313) and thymidine kinase (TK1; 188300), with galactokinase being
closer to the centromere.

Harper et al. (1982) used in situ hybridization to assign the GH gene
cluster to 17q22-q24. A gene copy number experiment showed that both
genes are present in about 3 copies per haploid genome. The sequence of
genes in the GH gene cluster is thought to be GHN--CSL--CSA--GHV--CSB
(Phillips, 1983). Normal growth hormone (GHN, referred to now as GH1)
encodes GH. CSA and CSB both encode chorionic somatomammotropin. GHV, or
growth hormone variant, is now designated GH2.

Xu et al. (1988) assigned the growth hormone complex to 17q23-q24 by in
situ hybridization.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Using GH cDNA as a specific DNA probe in Southern blot analyses,
Phillips et al. (1981) found that the GHN (GH1) gene was deleted in 2
families with type IA growth hormone deficiency (Illig type; 262400). On
the other hand, the GH genes of persons with type IB (612781) (in 6
families) had normal restriction patterns. Two affected sibs in 2 of the
6 families were discordant for 2 restriction markers closely linked to
the GH cluster.

Braga et al. (1986) reported the cases of a son and daughter of
first-cousin Italian parents who had isolated growth hormone deficiency
(IGHD) resulting from homozygosity for a 7.6-kb deletion within the GH
gene cluster. Both developed antibodies in response to treatment with
human GH, but in neither was there interference with growth. The
deletion affected not only the structural gene for GH (GH1) but also
sequences adjacent to CSL.

Goossens et al. (1986) described a double deletion in the GH gene
cluster in cases of inherited growth hormone deficiency. A total of
about 40 kb of DNA was absent due to 2 separate deletions flanking the
CSL gene (603515). Two affected sibs were homozygous. The parents were
'Romany of French origin' (i.e., French gypsies) and related as first
cousins once removed. Restriction patterns in them were consistent with
heterozygosity.

Vnencak-Jones et al. (1988) described the molecular basis of deletions
within the human GH gene cluster in 9 unrelated patients. Their results
suggested that the presence of highly repetitive DNA sequences flanking
the GH1 gene predisposed to unequal recombinant events through
chromosomal misalignment.

In a Chinese family, He et al. (1990) found that 2 sibs with GH
deficiency had a deletion of approximately 7.1 kb of DNA. The parents,
who were related as second cousins, were heterozygous but of normal
stature. The affected children had not received exogenous GH, but the
authors suspected that their disorder represented IGHD type IA.

Akinci et al. (1992) described a Turkish family in which 3 children had
IGHD type IA. A homozygous deletion of approximately 45 kb encompassing
the GH1, CSL, CSA, and GH2 genes was found. The end points of the
deletion lay within 2 regions of highly homologous DNA sequence situated
5-prime to the GH1 gene and 5-prime to the CSB gene. The parents, who
were consanguineous, were both heterozygous for the deletion.

Mullis et al. (1992) analyzed GH1 DNA from circulating lymphocytes of 78
subjects with severe IGHD. The subjects analyzed were broadly grouped
into 3 different populations: 32 north European, 22 Mediterranean, and
24 Turkish. Of the 78 patients, 10 showed a GH1 deletion; 8 had a 6.7-kb
deletion, and the remaining 2 had a 7.6-kb GH1 deletion. Five of the 10
subjects developed anti-hGH antibodies to hGH replacement followed by a
stunted growth response. Parental consanguinity was found in all
families, and heterozygosity for the corresponding deletion was present
in each parent. The proportion of deletion cases was about the same in
each of the 3 population groups.

Phillips and Cogan (1994) tabulated mutations found in the GH gene.

Takahashi et al. (1996) reported the case of a boy with short stature
and heterozygosity for a mutant GH gene (139250.0008). In this child,
the GH not only could not activate the GH receptor (GHR; 600946) but
also inhibited the action of wildtype GH because of its greater affinity
for GHR and GH-binding protein (GHBP), which is derived from the
extracellular domain of the GHR. Thus, a dominant-negative effect was
observed. See Kowarski syndrome, 262650.

Splicing of pre-mRNA transcripts is regulated by consensus sequences at
intron boundaries and the branch site. In vitro studies showed that the
small introns of some genes also require intron splice enhancers (ISE)
to modulate splice site selection. An autosomal dominant form of
isolated growth hormone deficiency (IGHD II; 173100) can be caused by
mutations in intron 3 (IVS3) of the GH1 gene that cause exon 3 skipping,
resulting in truncated GH1 gene products that prevent secretion of
normal GH. Some of these GH1 mutations are located 28 to 45 nucleotides
into IVS3 (which is 92 nucleotides long). McCarthy and Phillips (1998)
localized this ISE by quantitating the effects of deletions within IVS3
on skipping of exon 3. The importance of individual nucleotides to ISE
function was determined by analyzing the effects of point mutants and
additional deletions. The results showed that (1) an ISE with a
G(2)X(1-4)G(3) motif resides in IVS3 of the GH1 gene; (2) both runs of
Gs are required for ISE function; (3) a single copy of the ISE regulates
exon 3 skipping; and (4) ISE function can be modified by an adjacent AC
element. The findings revealed a new mechanism by which mutations can
cause inherited human endocrine disorders and suggested that (1) ISEs
may regulate splicing of transcripts of other genes, and (2) mutations
of these ISEs or of the transacting factors that bind them may cause
other genetic disorders.

Hasegawa et al. (2000) studied polymorphisms in the GH1 gene that were
associated with altered GH production. The subjects included 43
prepubertal short children with GHD without gross pituitary
abnormalities, 46 short children with normal GH secretion, and 294
normal adults. A polymorphism in intron 4 (A or T at nucleotide 1663,
designated P1) was identified. Two additional polymorphic sites (T or G
at nucleotide 218, designated P2, and G or T at nucleotide 439,
designated P3) in the promoter region of the GH1 gene were also
identified and matched with the P1 polymorphism (A or T, respectively)
in more than 90% of the subjects. P1, P2, and P3 were considered to be
associated with GH production. For example, the allele frequency of T at
P2 in prepubertal short children with GHD without gross pituitary
abnormalities (58%) was significantly different from that in short
children with normal GH secretion and normal adults (37% and 44%,
respectively). Furthermore, significant differences were observed in
maximal GH peaks in provocative tests, IGF1 (147440) SD scores, and
height SD scores in children with the T/T or G/G genotypes at P2. In the
entire study group, significant differences in IGF1 SD scores and height
SD scores were observed between the T/T and G/G genotypes at P2.
Hasegawa et al. (2000) concluded that GH secretion is partially
determined by polymorphisms in the GH1 gene, explaining some of the
variations in GH secretion and height.

Dennison et al. (2004) examined associations between common SNPs in the
GH1 gene and weight in infancy, adult bone mass and bone loss rates, and
circulating GH profiles. Genomic DNA was examined for 2 SNPs in the GH
gene, 1 in the promoter region and 1 in intron 4. Homozygotes at loci
GH1 A5157G and T6331A displayed low baseline bone density and
accelerated bone loss; there was also a significant (P = 0.04)
interaction among weight at 1 year, GH1 genotype, and bone loss rate.
There was a graded association between alleles and circulating GH
concentration among men. The authors concluded that common diversity in
the GH1 region predisposes to osteoporosis via effects on the level of
GH expression.

The proximal promoter region of the GH1 gene is highly polymorphic,
containing at least 15 SNPs. This variation is manifest in 40 different
haplotypes, the high diversity being explicable in terms of gene
conversion, recurrent mutation, and selection. Horan et al. (2003)
showed by functional analysis that 12 haplotypes were associated with a
significantly reduced level of reporter gene expression, whereas 10
haplotypes were associated with a significantly increased level. The
former tended to be more prevalent in the general population than the
latter (p less than 0.01), possibly as a consequence of selection.
Haplotype partitioning identified 6 SNPs as major determinants of GH1
gene expression, which is influenced by an LCR located between 14.5 and
32 kb upstream of the GH1 gene (Jones et al., 1995). Horan et al. (2003)
used a series of LCR-GH1 proximal promoter constructs to demonstrate
that the LCR enhanced proximal promoter activity by up to 2.8-fold
depending upon proximal promoter haplotype, and that the activity of a
given proximal promoter haplotype was also differentially enhanced by
different LCR haplotypes. The genetic basis of interindividual
differences in GH1 gene expression thus appeared to be extremely
complex.

Millar et al. (2003) sought to identify subtle mutations in the GH1
gene, which had been regarded as a comparatively rare cause of short
stature, in 3 groups: 41 individuals selected for short stature, reduced
height velocity, and bone age delay, 11 individuals with short stature
and IGHD, and 154 controls. Heterozygous mutations were identified in
all 3 groups but disproportionately in the individuals with short
stature, both with and without IGHD. Twenty-four novel GH1 gene lesions
were found. Fifteen novel GH1 gene mutations were considered to be of
probable phenotypic significance. Although most such lesions may be
insufficient on their own to account for the observed clinical
phenotype, they were considered likely to play a contributory role in
the etiology of short stature.

In a screen of the GH1 gene for mutations in a group of 74 children with
familial short stature, Lewis et al. (2004) identified 4 mutations, 2 of
which were novel: an ile179-to-met (I179M) substitution and a
single-basepair substitution in the promoter region. Resistance to
proteolysis and secretion from rat pituitary cells of I179M GH were
consistent with a lack of significant misfolding. Receptor binding
studies were normal, but molecular modeling studies suggested that the
I179M substitution might perturb interactions between GH and the GH
receptor loop containing residue trp169, thereby affecting signal
transduction. In contrast to its ability to activate STAT5 (601511)
normally, activation of ERK (see 176948) by the I179M variant was
reduced to half that observed with wildtype. The subject exhibited
normal GH secretion after pharmacologic stimulation. That the I179M
variant did not cosegregate with the short stature phenotype in the
family strongly suggested to Lewis et al. (2004) that this variant was
on its own insufficient to fully account for the observed clinical
phenotype.

Cogan et al. (1995, 1997) and Moseley et al. (2002) described 3
mutations (139250.0016; 139250.0011; 139250.0012) that are not located
at the 5-prime splice site in intron 3 but still alter splicing of GH1
to cause increased production of a 17.5-kD isoform. All 3 mutations
reside within purine-rich sequences that resemble exonic and intronic
splicing enhancers (ESE and ISE). Since splicing enhancers often
activate specific splice sites to facilitate exon definition, Ryther et
al. (2003) considered that the splicing defects caused by these
mutations could be due to a defect in exon definition, resulting in exon
skipping. They showed that overexpression of the dominant-negative
17.5-kD isoform also destroyed the majority of somatotrophs, leading to
anterior pituitary hypoplasia in transgenic mice. They demonstrated that
dual splicing enhancers are required to ensure exon 3 definition to
produce full-length 22-kD hormone. They also showed that splicing
enhancer mutations that weaken exon 3 recognition produce variable
amounts of the 17.5-kD isoform, a result that could potentially explain
the clinical variability observed in IGHD II. Noncanonical splicing
mutations that disrupt splicing enhancers, such as those represented by
the 3 mutations discussed, demonstrate the importance of enhancer
elements in regulating alternative splicing to prevent human disease.

Mullis et al. (2005) studied a total of 57 subjects with IGHD type II
(173100) belonging to 19 families with different splice site as well as
missense mutations within the GH1 gene. The subjects presenting with a
splice site mutation within the first 2 bp of intervening sequence 3
(5-prime IVS +1/+2 bp; 139250.0009) leading to a skipping of exon 3 were
more likely to present in the follow-up with other pituitary hormone
deficiencies. In addition, although the patients with missense mutations
had been reported to be less affected, a number of patients presenting
with a missense GH form showed some pituitary hormone impairment. The
development of multiple hormonal deficiencies is not age-dependent, and
there is a clear variability in onset, severity, and progression, even
within the same families. Mullis et al. (2005) concluded that the
message of clinical importance from these studies is that the pituitary
endocrine status of all such patients should continue to be monitored
closely over the years because further hormonal deficiencies may evolve
with time.

Shariat et al. (2008) studied a 4-generation family segregating
autosomal dominant growth hormone deficiency and identified a
heterozygous missense mutation in the GH gene (EX3+1G-A; 139250.0025) in
affected individuals. Analysis of the effects of this variant as well as
G-T and G-C changes at the first nucleotide of exon 3 illustrated the
multiple mechanisms by which changes in sequence can cause disease:
splice site mutations, splicing enhancer function, messenger RNA decay,
missense mutations, and nonsense mutations. The authors noted that for
IGHD II, only exon skipping leads to production of the dominant-negative
isoform, with increasing skipping correlating with increasing disease
severity.

Horan et al. (2006) observed an association between 4 core promoter
haplotypes in the GH1 gene and increased risk for hypertension and
stroke in a study of 111 hypertensive patients and 155 stroke patients.
The association was more significant for females than males. Horan et
al. (2006) also observed an association between an isoform of the GHR
gene lacking exon 3 (GHRd3) and hypertension in female stroke patients.
The authors postulated a complex interaction between variants in the GH1
and GHR genes involving height.

Giordano et al. (2008) studied the contribution to IGHD of genetic
variations in the GH1 gene regulatory regions. The T allele of a G-to-T
polymorphism at position -57 (dbSNP rs2005172), within the vitamin
D-responsive element, showed a positive significant association when
comparing patients with normal (P = 0.006) or short stature (P = 0.0011)
controls. The genotype -57TT showed an odds ratio of 2.93 (1.44-5.99)
and 2.99 (1.42-6.31), respectively. Giordano et al. (2008) concluded
that the common -57G-T polymorphism contributes to IGHD susceptibility,
indicating that it may have a multifactorial etiology.

ANIMAL MODEL

By Southern analysis of DNA from mouse-rat somatic cell hybrids, Cooke
et al. (1986) found that the GH gene is on rat chromosome 10 and the PRL
gene (176760) is on rat chromosome 17. Thus, in the rat, as in man,
these genes are on different chromosomes even though they show an
evolutionary relationship.

Morgan et al. (1987) showed that retrovirus-mediated gene transfer can
be used to introduce a recombinant human GH1 gene into cultured human
keratinocytes. The transduced keratinocytes secreted biologically active
GH into the culture medium. When grafted as an epithelial sheet onto
athymic mice, these cultured keratinocytes reconstituted a
normal-appearing epidermis from which, however, human growth hormone
could be extracted. Transduced epidermal cells may be a general vehicle
for the delivery of gene products by means of grafting.

Smith et al. (1997) demonstrated a role of GH in retinal
neovascularization, which is the major cause of untreatable blindness.
They found that retinal neovascularization was inhibited in transgenic
mice expressing a GH antagonist gene and in normal mice given an
inhibitor of GH secretion. In these mice retinal neovascularization was
inhibited in inverse proportion to serum levels of GH and IGF1.
Inhibition was reversed with exogenous IGF1 administration. GH
inhibition did not diminish hypoxia-stimulated retinal vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF; 192240) or VEGF receptor (VEGFR;
191306) expression. Smith et al. (1997) suggested that systemic
inhibition of GH or IGF1, or both, may have therapeutic potential in
preventing some forms of retinopathy.

Growth hormones from primates are unique in that they are able to bind
with and activate both primate and nonprimate GHRs, whereas GHs from
nonprimates are ineffective in primates. Behncken et al. (1997)
investigated the basis of primate specificity of binding by the GHR.
They examined the interaction between GHR residues arg43 (primate) or
leu43 (nonprimate) and their complementary hormone residues asp171
(primate) and his170 (nonprimate). They found that the interaction
between arg43 and his170/171 is sufficient to explain virtually all of
the primate species specificity.

In mouse preadipocytes, Wolfrum et al. (2003) found that Foxa2 (600288)
inhibited adipocyte differentiation by activating transcription of
preadipocyte factor-1 (DLK1; 176290), and that expression of both Foxa2
and Dlk1 was enhanced by growth hormone in primary preadipocytes.
Wolfrum et al. (2003) suggested that the antiadipogenic activity of
growth hormone is mediated by Foxa2.

Using GH-deficient Socs2 (605117) -/- mice, Greenhalgh et al. (2005)
demonstrated that the Socs2 -/- phenotype is dependent upon the presence
of endogenous GH. Treatment with exogenous GH induced excessive growth
in terms of overall body weight, body and bone lengths, and the weight
of internal organs and tissues. Microarray analysis on liver RNA
extracts after exogenous GH administration revealed a heightened
response to GH. The conserved C-terminal SOCS-box motif was essential
for all inhibitory function. SOCS2 was found to bind 2 phosphorylated
tyrosines on the GH receptor, and mutation analysis of these amino acids
showed that both were essential for SOCS2 function. Greenhalgh et al.
(2005) concluded that SOCS2 is a negative regulator of GH signaling.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
ISOLATED GROWTH HORMONE DEFICIENCY, TYPE IA
GH1, 2-BP DEL, FS132TER

Igarashi et al. (1993) identified a Japanese patient with growth
retardation (IGHD IA; 262400) with a compound heterozygous pattern
consisting of total deletion of 1 GH1 gene and retention of a GH1 gene
of apparently normal size. DNA sequence analysis demonstrated deletion
of 2 bases of exon 3 of 1 GH1 allele of the mother and the patient. The
father carried a 6.7-kb deletion (139250.0003), present also on the
patient's paternal allele. The patient was a 13-year-old female, the
offspring of healthy, nonconsanguineous parents. GH therapy, begun at
the age of 9 years and 2 months, resulted in catch-up growth without
development of anti-GH antibodies. Deletion of the 2 bases in exon 3 was
predicted to introduce a termination codon after the codon of amino acid
residue 131 in exon 4.

In a Turkish family with IGHD IA (262400), Cogan et al. (1993) found a
G-to-A transition converting codon 20 from tryptophan (TGG) to stop
(TAG) in the signal peptide of GH1. The mutation resulted in termination
of translation after residue 19 of the signal peptide and no production
of mature GH. Patients homozygous for the mutation had no detectable GH
and produced anti-GH antibodies in response to exogenous GH treatment.

Duquesnoy et al. (1990) described the cases of 2 sibs with IGHD IA
(262400) who were found to be compound heterozygotes for deletion and
frameshift mutations of the GH1 gene. Southern blot analysis showed them
to be heterozygous for a 6.7-kb GH deletion; DNA sequence analysis
demonstrated deletion of a cytosine at position 371, resulting in a
frameshift within the signal peptide coding region which prevented the
synthesis of any mature GH protein (139250.0004). The patients presented
with severe growth failure, and after an initial growth response to
treatment with exogenous GH, developed high titers of anti-GH
antibodies.

Vnencak-Jones et al. (1990) and Igarashi et al. (1993) also described
patients with 6.7-kb deletions deleting 1 GH1 allele.

GH1, IVS4, G-C, +1

In a consanguineous Saudi Arabian family with IGHD IB (612781), Cogan et
al. (1993) detected a G-to-C transversion of the first base of the donor
splice site of intron 4 as the basis of growth hormone deficiency. The
effect of this mutation on mRNA splicing was determined by transfecting
the mutant gene into cultured mammalian cells and DNA sequencing the
resulting GH cDNAs. Mutation was found to cause the activation of a
cryptic splice site 73 bases upstream of the exon 4 donor splice site.
The altered splicing resulted in loss of amino acids 103 to 126 of exon
4 and created a frameshift that altered the amino acids encoded by exon
5.

In another consanguineous Saudi family with IGHD IB (612781), Phillips
and Cogan (1994) found a mutation at the same nucleotide as that
described in 139250.0005. A G-to-T transversion in the first base of the
donor splice site of intron 4 had the same effect on splicing as the
G-to-C transversion. Patients homozygous for these 2 different defects
in 2 different families responded well to exogenous GH treatment and did
not develop anti-GH antibodies. Analogous splicing mutations occurred in
the beta-globin gene, causing milder forms of beta-thalassemia called
beta-plus-thalassemia.

GH1, IVS3, T-C, +6

Phillips and Cogan (1994) demonstrated a T-to-C transition in the sixth
base of the donor splice site of intron 3 in a Turkish family with IGHD
II (173100). The mutant GH gene was transfected into cultured mammalian
cells, and the GH mRNA transcripts were analyzed by direct sequencing of
their corresponding cDNAs. The mutation was found to inactivate the
donor splice site of intron 3, resulting in alternative use of the donor
splice site of intron 2 in conjunction with the acceptor site of intron
3. This alternative splicing pattern deleted or skipped exon 3,
resulting in the loss of amino acids 32 to 71 from the corresponding
mature GH protein products. All affected members of the family were
heterozygous for the mutation and had low but measurable GH levels after
stimulation. All responded well to treatment with exogenous GH. The
mechanism of the dominant-negative effect is unknown; the mutant GH
allele may inactivate the normal GH allele by formation of GH dimers or
disruption of normal intracellular protein transport.

KOWARSKI SYNDROME
GH1, ARG77CYS

Takahashi et al. (1996) reported a patient with short stature in whom
the bioactivity of growth hormone was below the normal range (Kowarski
syndrome; 262650). The patient was heterozygous for a C-to-T transition
in the GH1 gene that converted codon 77 from CGC (arg) to TGC (cys)
(R77C). Isoelectric focusing of the proband's serum revealed the
presence of an abnormal growth hormone peak in addition to the normal
peak. Further studies demonstrated that the child's growth hormone not
only could not activate the growth hormone receptor but also inhibited
the action of wildtype growth hormone because of its greater affinity
for growth hormone-binding protein and growth hormone receptor.

Petkovic et al. (2007) identified heterozygosity for the R77C mutation
in a Syrian boy with short stature and partial GH insensitivity. His
mother and grandfather had the same mutation and showed partial GH
insensitivity with modest short stature. Functional analyses showed no
differences in the binding affinity or bioactivity between wildtype and
GH-R77C, nor were differences found in the extent of subcellular
localization within endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, or secretory vesicles
between wildtype and GH-R77C. There was, however, a reduced capability
of GH-R477C to induce GHR/GHBP gene transcription rate when compared to
wildtype GH. Petkovic et al. (2007) concluded that reduced GHR/GHBP
expression might be a cause of the partial GH insensitivity with delay
in growth in this family.

.0009
ISOLATED GROWTH HORMONE DEFICIENCY, TYPE II
GH1, IVS3, G-A, +1

Cogan et al. (1995) reported a G-to-A transition of the first base of
the donor splice site of intron 3 (+1G to A) in IGHD II (173100)
subjects from 3 unrelated kindreds from Sweden, North America, and South
Africa. This transition created an NlaIII site that was used to
demonstrate that all affected individuals in all 3 families were
heterozygous for the mutation. In expression studies the transition was
found to destroy the GH intron 3 donor splice site, causing skipping of
exon 3 and loss of amino acids 32 to 71 of the mature GH peptide from
the mutant GH mRNA. Microsatellite analysis indicated that the mutation
arose independently in each family. In 1 family, the finding that
neither grandparent had the mutation suggests that it arose de novo.

Hayashi et al. (1999) identified 2 mutations in Japanese patients with
IGHD II, G-to-A transitions at the first (mutA) and fifth (mutE;
139250.0014) nucleotides of intron 3. GH1 mRNAs skipping exon 3 were
transcribed from both mutant genes. The authors studied the synthesis
and secretion of GH encoded by the mutant GH1 genes and tested whether
inhibition of wildtype GH secretion by mutant products could be
demonstrated in cultured cell lines. A metabolic labeling study in COS-1
cells revealed that a mutant GH with a reduced molecular mass was
synthesized from the mutant mRNAs and retained in the cells for at least
6 hours. On the other hand, the wildtype GH was rapidly secreted into
the medium. Coexpression of mutant and wildtype GH did not result in any
inhibition of wildtype GH secretion in COS-1 or HepG2 cells. However,
coexpression of mutant GH resulted in significant inhibition of wildtype
GH secretion in somatotroph-derived MtT/S cells as well as in
adrenocorticotroph-derived AtT-20 cells, without affecting cell
viability. Hayashi et al. (1999) concluded that the dominant-negative
effect of mutant GH on the secretion of wildtype GH is at least in part
responsible for the pathogenesis of IGHD II. They also suggested that
neuroendocrine cell type-specific mechanisms, including intracellular
storage of the secretory proteins, are involved in the inhibition.

Saitoh et al. (1999) described a 1-year-old Japanese boy and his father
with IGHD II, both of whom had a G-to-A transition of the first base of
the donor splice site of intron 3 of the GH1 gene. The mutation occurred
de novo in the father. No unaffected family members had the mutation.

Binder and Ranke (1995) reported a G-to-C transversion of the first base
of the donor splice site of intron 3 (+1G to C) in a sporadic case of
IGHD II (173100) in a German patient. This mutation was dominant
negative and arose de novo. They also reported RT-PCR data suggesting
overexpression of the mutant GH1 allele and speculated that the
dominant-negative effect might occur because of this imbalance in
expression of the mutant and normal alleles. However, Binder et al.
(1996) found equal quantities of transcripts in studies using an RNA
protection assay to determine the relative expression of the intron 3 +1
G-to-C mutant and normal GH1 alleles. In normal pituitary, they found 3
GH1 mRNA species with the variant lacking exon 3, which comprised
approximately 5% of the total GH1 mRNA. In contrast, lymphoblasts from
the proband, who was heterozygous for the transition at intron 1,
contained equal amounts of mRNA with or without exon 3. Furthermore,
secreted GH1, measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, was present
in equal concentrations in media from normal and mutant cells. Thus, GH1
mRNA lacking exon 3 was expressed in proportion to the dosage of the
mutant gene, and dominant-negative effects on GH1 secretion were not
seen in lymphoblasts. Their findings are compatible with a
dominant-negative mechanism involving interaction between normal and
mutant proteins in secretory vesicles of somatotropes, as suggested by
Cogan et al. (1995).

GH1, IVS3, G-A, +28

Cogan et al. (1997) reported 2 intron 3 mutations in 2 unrelated
kindreds with autosomal dominant growth hormone deficiency (173100).
These mutations perturbed splicing and caused exon 3 skipping; however,
the mutations did not occur within the intron 3 branch consensus sites
or the 5-prime or 3-prime splice sites. Instead, these mutations
deranged sequences homologous to XGGG repeats that regulate alternative
mRNA splicing in other genes. Eukaryotic pre-mRNA splicing is regulated
by consensus sequences at the intron boundaries and branch site.
Sirand-Pugnet et al. (1995) demonstrated the importance of an additional
intronic sequence, an (A/U)GGG repeat in chicken beta-tropomyocin that
is a binding site for a protein required for spliceosome assembly. The
mutations found by Cogan et al. (1997) in the third intron of the GH
gene affected a putative, homologous consensus sequence and disturbed
splicing. The first mutation was a G-to-A transition base 28 of intron 3
and the second deleted 18 bp (del+28-45; 139250.0012) of intron 3 of the
human GH gene. The findings suggested that XGGG repeats may regulate
alternative splicing in the human growth hormone gene and that mutations
of these repeats cause growth hormone deficiency by perturbing
alternative splicing.

See 139250.0011 and Cogan et al. (1997). McCarthy and Phillips (1998)
presented evidence that this mutation and the G-to-A transition at

(ISE) that is critical for the proper splicing of transcripts of the GH1
gene.

KOWARSKI SYNDROME
GH1, ASP112GLY

In a child presenting with short stature, Takahashi et al. (1997)
demonstrated a biologically inactive growth hormone (262650) resulting
from a heterozygous single-base substitution (A to G) in exon 4 of the
GH1 gene. This change resulted in an asp112-to-gly amino acid
substitution. At age 3 years, the girl's height was 3.6 standard
deviations below the mean for age and sex. Bone age was delayed by 1.5
years. She had a prominent forehead and a hypoplastic nasal bridge with
normal body proportions. She showed lack of growth hormone action
despite high immunoassayable GH levels in serum and marked catch-up
growth to exogenous GH administration. Results of other studies were
compatible with the production of a bioinactive GH, which prevented
dimerization of the growth hormone receptor, a crucial step in GH signal
transduction.

In a father and his 2 daughters with autosomal dominant isolated growth
hormone deficiency (173100), Kamijo et al. (1999) found a G-to-A
transition at the fifth base of intron 3 of the GH1 gene. The paternal
grandparents did not show the mutation, indicating that it was a new
mutation in the case of the father. Kamijo et al. (1999) studied 2 other
(sporadic) cases of IGHD II. It is curious and undoubtedly significant
that so many mutations have been found in the splice donor site of IVS3
in cases of isolated growth hormone deficiency type II.

Abdul-Latif et al. (2000) identified an extended, highly inbred Bedouin
kindred with IGHD that clinically fulfilled the criteria for type IB
(612781). Molecular studies demonstrated a novel mutation in the GH1
gene: a G-to-C transversion of the fifth base of intron 4, which
appeared to cause GH deficiency through the use of a cryptic splice site
and, consequently, formation of a different protein. Clinical
observations suggested that apparently healthy, non-GH-deficient
individuals in this family were of relatively short stature. Leiberman
et al. (2000) correlated height measurements of potential heterozygotes
with carrier status for the newly identified mutation. Indeed, they
found that carriers of the mutant allele in heterozygous state had
significantly shorter stature than normal homozygotes. They found that
11 of 33 (33%) of heterozygotes, but only 1 of 17 (5.9%) of normal
homozygotes had their height at 2 or more standard deviations below the
mean. Overall, 48.5% of studied heterozygotes were found to be of
appreciably short stature with height at or lower than the 5th centile,
whereas only 5.9% of the normal homozygotes fell into that range (P less
than 0.004).

Moseley et al. (2002) reported an A-to-G transition of the fifth base of
exon 3 (exon 3+5A-G) in affected individuals from an IGHD II (173100)
family. This mutation disrupts a (GAA)n exon splice enhancer (ESE) motif
immediately following the weak IVS2 3-prime splice site. The mutation
also destroys a MboII site used to demonstrate heterozygosity in all
affected family members. To determine the effect of ESE mutations on GH
mRNA processing, GH3 cells were transfected with expression constructs
containing the normal ESE, +5A-G, or other ESE mutations, and cDNAs
derived from the resulting GH mRNAs were sequenced. All ESE mutations
studied reduced activation of the IVS2 3-prime splice site and caused
either partial exon 3 skipping, due to activation of an exon 3 +45
cryptic 3-prime splice site, or complete exon 3 skipping. Partial or
complete exon 3 skipping led to loss of the codons for amino acids 32-46
or 32-71, respectively, of the mature GH protein. They concluded that
the exon 3 +5A-G mutation causes IGHD II because it perturbs an ESE
required for GH splicing.

GH1, EX3DEL

In affected members of a Japanese family with autosomal dominant
isolated growth hormone deficiency (173100), Takahashi et al. (2002)
found a heterozygous G-to-T transversion at the first 5-prime site
nucleotide of exon 3. Analysis of the GH1 cDNA, synthesized from
lymphoblasts of the patients, revealed an abnormally short transcript as
well as a normal-sized transcript. Direct sequencing of the abnormal
transcript showed that it completely lacked exon 3. In IGHD II, several
heterozygous mutations have been reported at the donor splice site in
intron 3 of the GH1 gene or inside intron 3 (e.g., 139250.0007,
139250.0009, 139250.0010), which cause aberrant growth hormone mRNA
splicing, resulting in the deletion of exon 3. Loss of exon 3 results in
lack of amino acid residues 32 to 71 in the mature growth hormone
protein. This mutant growth hormone exerts a dominant-negative effect on
the secretion of mature normal growth hormone protein. Thus, in the
family reported by Takahashi et al. (2002), the G-to-T transversion at
the first nucleotide resulted in deletion of exon 3 and caused growth
hormone deficiency. Takahashi et al. (2002) suggested that the first
nucleotide of exon 3 is critical for the splicing of GH1 mRNA.

Fofanova et al. (2003) studied mutations in 28 children from 26 families
with total IGHD living in Russia. They found 3 dominant-negative
mutations causing IGHD type II (173100): 1) an A-to-T transversion of
the second base of the 3-prime acceptor splice site of intron 2 (IVS2
-2A-T); 2) a T-to-C transition of the second base of the 5-prime donor
splice site of intron 3 (IVS3 +2T-C; 139250.0019); 3) and a G-to-A
transition of the first base of the 5-prime donor splice site of intron
3 (IVS3 +1G-A; 139250.0009). The IVS -2A-T mutation was the first
identified mutation in intron 2 of GH1. The authors concluded that the
5-prime donor splice site of intron 3 of GH1 is a mutation hotspot, and
the IVS3 +1G-A mutation can be considered to be a common molecular
defect in IGHD II in Russian patients.

KOWARSKI SYNDROME
GH1, CYS53SER

In a Serbian patient with short stature and bioinactive growth hormone
(Kowarski syndrome; 262650) Besson et al. (2005) detected a homozygous
cys53-to-ser (C53S) mutation in the GH1 gene. The mutation arose from a
G-to-C transversion at nucleotide position 705 (G705C). The
phenotypically normal first-cousin parents were heterozygous for the
mutation. This mutation was predicted to lead to the absence of the
disulfide bridge cys53 to cys165. In GH receptor (GHR; 600946) binding
and Jak2 (147796)/Stat5 (601511) activation experiments, Besson et al.
(2005) observed that at physiologic concentrations (3-50 ng/ml), both
GHR binding and Jak2/Stat5 signaling pathway activation were
significantly reduced in the mutant GH-C53S, compared with wildtype.
Higher concentrations (400 ng/ml) were required for this mutant to
elicit responses similar to wildtype GH. Besson et al. (2005) concluded
that the absence of the disulfide bridge cys53 to cys165 affects the
binding affinity of GH for the GHR and subsequently the potency of GH to
activate the Jak2/Stat5 signaling pathway.

In a 2-year-old child and her mother with severe growth failure at
diagnosis (IGHD II; 173100) (-5.8 and -6.9 SD score, respectively),
Vivenza et al. (2006) identified a heterozygous 22-bp deletion in IVS3
of the GH1 gene, designated IVS3del+56-77, removing the putative branch
point sequence (BPS). Both patients showed 2 principal mRNA species
approximately in equal amount, i.e., a full-length species encoded by
the normal allele, and an aberrant splicing product with the skipping of
exon 3 encoded by the mutant allele. Their clinical phenotype correlated
with that observed in other IGHD II patients harboring splice site
mutations.

GH1, ARG183HIS

In a large kindred with dominant growth hormone deficiency (IGHD II;
173100) Gertner et al. (1998) detected a heterozygous G-to-A transition
at nucleotide 6664 in exon 5 of the GH1 gene, resulting in an
arg183-to-his substitution (R183H).

Hess et al. (2007) studied the phenotype-genotype correlation of
subjects with IGHD II caused by a R183H mutation in the GH1 gene in 34
affected members of 2 large families. Twenty-four of the 52 members from
family 1 and 10 of the 14 from family 2 carried the same mutation in a
heterozygous state. The affected subjects in family 1 were significantly
shorter (-2.6 vs -0.1 standard deviation score (SDS), p less than
0.0001) and had significantly lower IGF1 (147440) serum levels (-1.9 vs
-0.5 SDS, p less than 0.0001), compared with family members with a
normal genotype. The affected adults exhibited great variability in
their stature, ranging from -4.5 to -1.0 SD (mean -2.8 SDS), with 5
members being of normal height (greater than -2 SDS). Twelve children
were diagnosed with IGHD. Two affected children had normal peak GH
levels, although 1 of these subsequently demonstrated GH insufficiency.
The affected children from both families exhibited large variability in
their height, growth velocity, delay in bone age, age at diagnosis, peak
GH response, and IGF1 levels. Hess et al. (2007) concluded that these
detailed phenotypic analyses show the variable expressivity of patients
bearing the R183H mutation, reflecting the spectrum of GH deficiency in
affected patients, even within families, and the presence of additional
genes modifying height determination.

ISOLATED GROWTH HORMONE DEFICIENCY, TYPE II
GH1, EX3, A-C, +2

In 2 independent pedigrees with IGHD II (173100), Petkovic et al. (2007)
identified a heterozygous splice enhancer mutation in exon 3, exon
3+2A-C, that encodes a glutamic acid-to-alanine change at position 32 in
the GH protein (E32A) and leads to missplicing at the mRNA level,
producing large amounts of the 17.5-kD GH isoform. Mouse pituitary cells
coexpressing both wildtype and mutant GH-E32A protein presented a
significant reduction in cell proliferation as well as GH production
after forskolin stimulation when compared with the cells expressing
wildtype GH. These results were complemented with confocal microscopy
analysis, which revealed a significant reduction of the GH-E32A-derived
isoform colocalized with secretory granules, compared with wildtype GH.
Petkovic et al. (2007) concluded that the GH-E32A mutation, which
occurred in the exon splice enhancer (ESE1), weakens recognition of exon
3 directly, and therefore increases production of the exon 3-skipped
17.5-kD GH isoform in relation to the 22-kD, wildtype GH isoform.

In affected members of a 4-generation family segregating autosomal
dominant growth hormone deficiency (173100), Shariat et al. (2008)
identified heterozygosity for a +1G-A transition in exon 3 of the GH
gene. The change was predicted to encode a glu32-to-lys (E32K)
substitution; however, transfection studies showed that when the mutant
was expressed, there was an approximately 6-fold increase in skipping of
exon 3 compared to wildtype (39% and 6%, respectively). Functional
analysis revealed that the variant weakens the 3-prime splice site and
simultaneously disrupts a splicing enhancer located within the first 7
bases of exon 3.

182267	TITLE *182267 SMALL PROLINE-RICH PROTEIN 2A; SPRR2A
DESCRIPTION For background information on the SPRR gene family, see 182265.

CLONING

Gibbs et al. (1993) concluded that there are 7 genes for the SPRR2
subfamily of small proline-rich proteins, including SPRR2A.

GENE FUNCTION

Using DNA microarray analysis, Zimmermann et al. (2005) identified
Sprr2a and Sprr2b (182268) as allergen-induced genes in a mouse model of
experimental asthma.

MAPPING

By analysis of human-rodent hybrid cell lines and FISH, Gibbs et al.
(1993) determined that all SPRR genes, including SPRR2A, are closely
linked within a 300-kb DNA segment on chromosome 1q21-q22.

136515	TITLE *136515 FOS-LIKE ANTIGEN 1; FOSL1
;;FOS-RELATED ANTIGEN 1; FRA1
DESCRIPTION 
GENE FUNCTION

Osteoclasts are bone-resorbing cells derived from hematopoietic
precursors of the monocyte-macrophage lineage. Mice lacking Fos (164810)
develop osteopetrosis (see 166600) due to an early differentiation block
in the osteoclast lineage. Matsuo et al. (2000) investigated the
mechanism by which Fos exerts its specific function in osteoclast
differentiation. They showed by retroviral-gene transfer that all 4 Fos
proteins--Fos, FosB (164772), Fosl1, and Fosl2 (601575)--but not the Jun
proteins (e.g., 165160), rescued the differentiation block in vitro.
Structure-function analysis demonstrated that the major carboxy-terminal
transactivation domains of Fos and FosB are dispensable and that Fosl1,
which lacks transactivation domains, has the highest rescue activity.
Moreover, a transgene expressing Fosl1 rescued the osteopetrosis of Fos
mutant mice in vivo. The osteoclast differentiation factor Rankl
(602642) induced transcription of Fosl1 in a Fos-dependent manner,
thereby establishing a link between Rank signaling and the expression of
Ap1 proteins in osteoclast differentiation.

Kustikova et al. (1998) found a correlation between Fra1 expression and
mesenchymal characteristics in cell lines of epithelial tumor origin.
Exogenous expression of Fra1 in epithelioid cells resulted in
morphologic changes that resembled fibroblastoid conversion, with cells
acquiring elongated shape and increased motility and invasiveness in
vitro. The morphologic alterations were accompanied by transcriptional
activation of genes whose expression is often induced at late stages of
tumor progression.

MAPPING

Sinke et al. (1993) applied the designation 'reverse mapping' to the
identification of a previously known gene within a cosmid for which the
localization was already known. For the identification of sequence
tagged sites (STSs) within cosmid clones derived from the 11q13 region,
they subcloned a number of single-copy BamHI fragments. In one of the
subclones, they found a sequence that matched perfectly with the 5-prime
end of the cDNA sequence for human FRA1. The FRA1 fragment was contained
within a clone previously mapped to region V of a long-range contig map
of 11q13. The localization to chromosome 11 was cross-checked by
hybridization to a panel of somatic cell hybrids. Thus another oncogene
was assigned to the region implicated in a number of different forms of
malignancy.

ANIMAL MODEL

Eferl et al. (2004) noted that Fra1 knockout in mice results in
embryonic death in utero, likely due to placental defects. Using
conditional deletion, they deleted Fra1 throughout mouse embryos, but
not in extraembryonic tissues, such as placenta. Homozygous mutant mice
were viable, but they developed osteopenia due to reduced bone
formation. The numbers of osteoblasts and osteoclasts were unchanged,
although in vitro and in vivo analysis revealed severely reduced
bone-forming activity of osteoblasts. Eferl et al. (2004) concluded that
the defect was likely due to reduced expression of the bone matrix genes
osteocalcin (112260), collagen-1A2 (120160), and matrix Gla protein
(154870).

608122	TITLE *608122 PARVIN, GAMMA; PARVG
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the parvin family, including PARVG, are actin-binding
proteins associated with focal contacts.

CLONING

By searching EST databases for sequences similar to mouse Parva
(608120), followed by RT-PCR of a human T-cell line cDNA library, Olski
et al. (2001) cloned human PARVG. Mouse and human PARVG encode a deduced
331-amino acid protein that contains a single actin-binding domain made
up of 2 calponin (600806) homology domains separated by a linker region.
Unlike PARVA and PARVB (608121), the N terminus of PARVG does not
contain nuclear localization signals or SH3-binding domains.

By analyzing PARVG ESTs, Korenbaum et al. (2001) identified
alternatively spliced sequences and a single polyadenylation site.
Northern blot analysis revealed a strong smeared signal in heart, liver,
and several other tissues. Bands of about 1.6 and 4.0 kb were detected
in peripheral blood and spleen. RNA dot blot analysis detected highest
expression in lymphatic organs (spleen, thymus, lymph node, bone marrow,
and peripheral blood leukocytes) and moderate expression in the
digestive tract (stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, ileocecum, and
appendix), lung, and liver. In contrast, mouse Parvg showed highest
expression in testis, where there were at least 6 mRNA species. A 2.8-kb
Parvg transcript was expressed highly in spleen, moderately in lung, and
weakly in brain and heart. Parvg was expressed throughout mouse
embryonic development, with downregulation at embryonic day 11.
Korenbaum et al. (2001) stated that fluorescence-tagged PARVG, like
PARVA, localized at focal contacts.

GENE STRUCTURE

Korenbaum et al. (2001) determined that the PARVG gene contains 15 exons
and spans about 25 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Korenbaum et al. (2001) mapped the PARVG
gene to chromosome 22q13.31, where it lies head to tail about 12 kb
telomeric to the PARVB gene.

601143	TITLE *601143 DYNACTIN 1; DCTN1
;;p150(GLUED), DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Cytoplasmic dynein is a microtubule-based biologic motor protein.
Holzbaur and Tokito (1996) noted that dyneins were initially discovered
as enzymes that couple ATP hydrolysis to provide a force for cellular
motility in eukaryotic cilia and flagella. A distinct cytoplasmic form
of dynein (600112) was subsequently characterized and thought to be
responsible for the intracellular retrograde motility of vesicles and
organelles along microtubules (Holzbaur and Vallee, 1994). A large
macromolecular complex, dynactin, is required for the cytoplasmic
dynein-driven movement of organelles along microtubules. Dynactin is
composed of 10 distinct polypeptides of 150, 135, 62, 50 (DCTN2;
607376), 45, 42, 37, 32, 27, and 24 kD, with a combined mass of 10
million daltons. The largest polypeptide of the dynactin complex,
p150(Glued), binds directly to microtubules and to cytoplasmic dynein.
The binding of dynactin to dynein is critical for neuronal function, as
antibodies that specifically disrupt this binding block vesicle motility
along microtubules in extruded squid axoplasm. Holzbaur and Tokito
(1996) stated that the dynein-dynactin interaction is probably a key
component of the mechanism of axonal transport of vesicles and
organelles. Further evidence for a critical role for dynactin in vivo
comes from the analysis of mutations in the homologous gene in
Drosophila. Mutant alleles of the 'glued' gene induced disruption of the
neurons of the optic lobe and compound eye in heterozygotes; null
mutations are lethal.

CLONING

Holzbaur and Tokito (1996) isolated and characterized cDNA clones
encoding human p150(Glued), as well as alternatively spliced isoforms.
Using these to isolate genomic clones, they found by genomic Southern
blots that there is a single gene in the human, as had previously been
observed in rat and chick.

Jang et al. (1997) cloned and characterized mouse Dctn1. The mouse
protein shares 95% amino acid identity with the human protein. The
authors found no abnormalities of the gene in mnd2 mice.

GENE FUNCTION

Eaton et al. (2002) disrupted the dynactin complex in Drosophila, using
3 separate perturbations: dsRNA interference with arp1 (homolog of
ACTR1A; 605143), mutation in p150/Glued, and a dominant-negative Glued
transgene. In all 3 cases, the disruption resulted in an increase in the
frequency and extent of synaptic retraction events at the neuromuscular
junction. Eaton et al. (2002) concluded that dynactin functions locally
within the presynaptic arbor to promote synapse stability at the
neuromuscular junction.

Kim et al. (2004) showed that BBS4 (600374) protein localizes to the
centriolar satellites of centrosomes and basal bodies of primary cilia,
where it functions as an adaptor of the p150(glued) subunit of the
dynein transport machinery to recruit pericentriolar material-1 protein
(PCM1; 600299) and its associated cargo to the satellites. Silencing of
BBS4 induces PCM1 mislocalization and concomitant deanchoring of
centrosomal microtubules, arrest in cell division, and apoptotic cell
death.

Gauthier et al. (2004) showed that huntingtin (613004) specifically
enhances vesicular transport of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF;
113505) along microtubules. They determined that huntingtin-mediated
transport involves huntingtin-associated protein-1 (HAP1; 600947) and
the p150(Glued) subunit of dynactin, an essential component of molecular
motors. BDNF transport was attenuated both in the disease context and by
reducing the levels of wildtype huntingtin. The alteration of the
huntingtin/HAP1/p150(Glued) complex correlated with reduced association
of motor proteins with microtubules. The
polyglutamine-huntingtin-induced transport deficit resulted in the loss
of neurotrophic support and neuronal toxicity. Gauthier et al. (2004)
concluded that a key role of huntingtin is to promote BDNF transport and
suggested that loss of this function might contribute to pathogenesis.

Using in vivo skin-specific lentiviral RNA interference, Williams et al.
(2011) investigated spindle orientation regulation and provided direct
evidence that LGN (609245), NuMA (164009), and dynactin are involved. In
compromising asymmetric cell divisions, Williams et al. (2011) uncovered
profound defects in stratification, differentiation, and barrier
formation, and implicated Notch (190198) signaling as an important
effector. Williams et al. (2011) concluded that asymmetric cell division
components act by reorientating mitotic spindles to achieve
perpendicular divisions, which in turn promote stratification and
differentiation. Furthermore, the resemblance between their knockdown
phenotypes and Rbpj (147183) loss-of-function mutants provided important
clues that suprabasal Notch signaling is impaired when asymmetric cell
divisions do not occur.

GENE STRUCTURE

Collin et al. (1998) found that the DCTN1 gene spans approximately 19.4
kb of genomic DNA and consists of at least 32 exons ranging in size from
15 to 499 bp.

Pushkin et al. (2001) showed by Southern blot and BAC analyses that the
DCTN1 and SLC4A5 (606757) proteins are encoded by a single locus. The
DCTN1-SLC4A5 locus spans approximately 230 kb and contains 66 exons.
Approximately 200 kb encode SLC4A5. DCTN1 is encoded by exons 1 through
alternative exon 32. The same locus therefore uniquely encodes both a
membrane protein (SLC4A5) and a cytoplasmic protein (DCTN1) with
distinct functions.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Holzbaur and Tokito (1996) mapped
the DCTN1 gene to 2p13. They noted that the location of the gene
corresponds to that of a form of recessive limb-girdle muscular
dystrophy (see LGMD2B; 253601). Also, this region of human chromosome 2
shows syntenic homology with a region of mouse chromosome 6 containing
the mnd2 mouse mutation, which exhibits symptoms resembling human motor
neuron disease.

Korthaus et al. (1997) presented evidence that the DCTN1 gene maps to
chromosome 2 between TGFA and D2S1394.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Puls et al. (2003) identified a gly59-to-ser mutation (601143.0001) in
the DCTN1 gene in a family with slowly progressive autosomal dominant
distal hereditary motor neuronopathy with vocal paresis (HMN7B; 607641).

Among 250 patients with a putative diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis (ALS; 105400), Munch et al. (2004) identified 3 mutations in
the DCTN1 gene (601143.0002-601143.0004) in 3 families. The authors
distinguished the phenotype in their patients from that reported by Puls
et al. (2003) by the presence of upper motor neuron signs, although
specific clinical details were lacking. Munch et al. (2004) suggested
that mutations in the DCTN1 gene may be a susceptibility factor for ALS.

In affected members of 8 families with Perry syndrome (168605), Farrer
et al. (2009) identified 5 different heterozygous mutations in the DCTN1
gene (see, e.g., 601143.0006-601143.0007). In vitro functional
expression studies indicated that the mutations resulted in decreased
microtubule binding and intracytoplasmic inclusions.

Vilarino-Guell et al. (2009) sequenced the DCTN1 gene in 286 individuals
with Parkinson disease (PD; 168600), frontotemporal lobar degeneration
(FTLD; 600274), or ALS. None of the 36 variants identified segregated
conclusively within families, suggesting that DCTN1 mutations are rare
and do not play a common role in these diseases. Further analysis of 440
patients with PD, 374 with FTLD, and 372 with ALS without a family
history also failed to find an association between DCTN1 variants and
disease. In fact, the previously reported pathogenic mutation T1249I
(601143.0002) was identified in 3 of 435 controls and did not segregate
in a large pedigree with Parkinson disease, thus weakening the evidence
for the pathogenicity of this variant.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
NEURONOPATHY, DISTAL HEREDITARY MOTOR, TYPE VIIB
DCTN1, GLY59SER

In a North American family with a slowly progressive, autosomal dominant
form of lower motor neuron with vocal cord paresis but without sensory
symptoms (607641), Puls et al. (2003) found a single-basepair change in
the DCTN1 gene (957C-T) resulting in an amino acid substitution of
serine for glycine at position 59 in affected family members. The G59S
substitution occurred in the highly conserved CAP-Gly motif of the
p150(Glued) subunit of dynactin, a domain that binds directly to
microtubules. The transport protein dynactin is required for
dynein-mediated retrograde transport of vesicles and organelles along
microtubules. Overexpression of dynamitin (607376), the p50 subunit of
the dynactin complex, disrupts the complex and produces a late-onset,
progressive motor neuron disease in transgenic mice (LaMonte et al.,
2002).

Based on crystal structure, gly59 is embedded in a beta-sheet. In
budding yeast, Moore et al. (2009) generated a G59S-analogous mutation
that resulted in complete loss of the CAP-Gly domain. Functional
expression studies showed that the CAP-Gly domain has a critical role in
the initiation and persistence of dynein-dependent movement of the
mitotic spindle and nucleus, but was otherwise dispensable for
dynein-based movement. The function also appeared to be
context-dependent, such as during mitosis, indicating that CAP-Gly
activity may only be necessary when dynein needs to overcome high force
thresholds to produce movement. The CAP-Gly domain was not the primary
link between dynactin and microtubules, although it was involved in the
interaction.

.0002
AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
DCTN1, THR1249ILE

In a woman with a disorder similar to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
(105400), Munch et al. (2004) identified a heterozygous 4546C-T
transition in exon 13 of the DCTN1 gene, resulting in a thr1249-to-ile
(T1249I) substitution. She had disease onset at age 56 years, with gait
disturbance and distal lower limb muscle weakness and atrophy. The
symptoms were slowly progressive over 4 years. There was no involvement
of the upper limbs or bulbar region. There was no family history. The
mutation was not identified in 150 control subjects. See also 607641.

Vilarino-Guell et al. (2009) identified the T1249I variant in 3 of 435
controls, 5 of 440 patients with Parkinson disease (168600), 1 of 374
with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (600274), and 5 of 372 patients
with ALS. Lack of segregation of the variant in a large pedigree with
Parkinson disease weakened the evidence for the pathogenicity of this
variant.

.0003
AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
DCTN1, MET571THR

In a woman with probable ALS (105400), Munch et al. (2004) identified a
heterozygous 2512T-C transition in exon 15 of the DCTN1 gene, resulting
in a met571-to-thr (M571T) substitution. She had onset of upper limb
involvement at age 48 years and developed bulbar symptoms within 8
years. Her sister was similarly affected, although DNA was not
available. The mutation was not identified in 150 control subjects.

.0004
AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
DCTN1, ARG785TRP

In 2 brothers with probable ALS (105400), Munch et al. (2004) identified
a heterozygous 3153C-T transition in exon 20 of the DCTN1 gene,
resulting in an arg785-to-trp (R785W) substitution. The proband had
upper limb onset at age 55 years, whereas his brother had bulbar onset
at age 64 years. The asymptomatic mother and sister carried the same
mutation, suggesting incomplete penetrance. The mutation was not
identified in 150 control subjects.

.0005
AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
DCTN1, ARG1101LYS

In a patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (105400), Munch et al.
(2005) identified a heterozygous 4102G-A transition in the DCTN1 gene,
resulting in an arg1101-to-lys (R1101K) substitution. The patient's
brother, who also carried the R1101K mutation, had frontotemporal
dementia without motor involvement. Family history revealed that 2
additional family members reportedly had motor neuron disease and
frontotemporal dementia, respectively, but their DNA was not available
for testing. The mutation was not identified in 500 control individuals.
Despite the molecular findings, Munch et al. (2005) suggested that the
R1101K variant may not be the primary gene defect in this family.

.0006
PERRY SYNDROME
DCTN1, GLY71ARG

In affected members of 2 unrelated families with Perry syndrome
(168605), Farrer et al. (2009) identified a heterozygous 211G-A
transition in exon 2 of the DCTN1 gene, resulting in a gly71-to-arg
(G71R) substitution in a highly conserved residue within the GKNDG
binding motif of the CAP-Gly domain. The families were of Canadian and
Turkish ancestry, respectively, and haplotype analysis excluded a
founder effect. In vitro functional expression studies showed that the
mutation decreased microtubule binding and resulted in intracytoplasmic
inclusions.

.0007
PERRY SYNDROME
DCTN1, GLN74PRO

In affected members of a Japanese family with Perry syndrome (168605),
Farrer et al. (2009) identified a heterozygous 221A-C transversion in
exon 2 of the DCTN1 gene, resulting in a gln74-to-pro (Q74P)
substitution in a highly conserved residue adjacent to the GKNDG binding
motif of the CAP-Gly domain. In vitro functional expression studies
showed that the mutation decreased microtubule binding and resulted in
intracytoplasmic inclusions.

605117	TITLE *605117 SUPPRESSOR OF CYTOKINE SIGNALING 2; SOCS2
;;STAT-INDUCED STAT INHIBITOR 2; SSI2; STATI2;;
CYTOKINE-INDUCIBLE SH2 PROTEIN 2; CIS2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SOCS proteins, such as SOCS2, negatively regulate cytokine receptor
signaling via the Janus kinase (see 147795)/signal transducer and
activation of transcription (STAT; see 600555) pathway (the JAK/STAT
pathway) (Minamoto et al., 1997).

CLONING

By a computer-aided homology search of sequence databases, Minamoto et
al. (1997) identified a partial sequence of SSI2, a member of the SSI
(STAT-induced STAT inhibitor) gene family. They isolated an SSI2 cDNA
from a Jurkat cDNA library. SSI2 encodes a protein of 198 amino acids.
The deduced amino acid sequences of human SSI2 and SSI3 (604176) share
significant homology with human and mouse SSI1 (SOCS1; 603597) and mouse
Cis (602441) at the C-terminal region as well as in the SH2 domain.
Northern blot analysis revealed strong expression of SSI2 in heart,
placenta, lung, kidney, and prostate.

On the basis of an EST database search, Masuhara et al. (1997)
identified SOCS2, which they called CIS2. They found that a C-terminal
40-amino acid region, designated the CIS homology (CH) domain, and the
SH2 domain are highly conserved in the CIS genes, while the respective
N-terminal regions of these proteins share little similarity.

Dey et al. (1998) identified SOCS2 based on its interaction with the
cytoplasmic domain of insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF1R;
147370) in a yeast 2-hybrid screen. They cloned a full-length SOCS2 cDNA
by 5-prime RACE PCR of a human fetal brain cDNA library. Northern blot
analysis demonstrated expression of SOCS2 in many human fetal and adult
tissues, with particular abundance in fetal kidney and adult heart,
skeletal muscle, pancreas, and liver.

GENE FUNCTION

Minamoto et al. (1997) found that SSI2 expression was induced by
cytokine stimulation, and its forced expression in the mouse myeloid
leukemia cell line M1 suppressed the apoptotic affects of LIF (159540)
similarly to SSI1.

Dey et al. (1998) found that the human SOCS2 protein interacted strongly
with the activated IGF1R and not with a kinase-negative mutant receptor
in yeast 2-hybrid assays. Mutation of receptor tyrosines 950, 1250,
1251, and 1316 to phenylalanine or deletion of the C-terminal 93 amino
acids did not result in decreased interaction of the receptor with human
SOCS2 protein. SOCS2 interacted with IGF1R both in vitro and in vivo.
Dey et al. (1998) concluded that their results raised the possibility
that SOCS proteins may play a regulatory role in IGF1 receptor
signaling.

Machado et al. (2006) showed that lipoxin A4 (LXA4) activated 2
receptors in mouse splenic dendritic cells, Ahr (600253) and Lxar
(FPRL1; 136538), and that this activation triggered Socs2.
Socs2-deficient mouse dendritic cells were hyperresponsive to microbial
stimuli and were refractory to the inhibitory action of LXA4, but not
Il10 (124092). Upon infection with an intracellular pathogen,
Socs2-deficient mice had uncontrolled production of proinflammatory
cytokines, decreased microbial proliferation, aberrant leukocyte
infiltration, and elevated mortality. Machado et al. (2006) also showed
that Socs2 was a crucial intracellular mediator of the antiinflammatory
actions of aspirin-induced lipoxins in vivo.

GENE STRUCTURE

Metcalf et al. (2000) demonstrated that the mouse SOCS2 gene is composed
of 3 exons and 2 introns.

MAPPING

By cytogenetic and radiation hybrid mapping, Yandava et al. (1999)
mapped the SOCS2 gene to chromosome 12q21.3-q23.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Kato et al. (2006) performed a region-wide association analysis on
12q15-q22 using more than 500 SNPs in 1,492 unrelated Japanese
individuals and identified an association between type II diabetes
(125853) and a 13.6-kb haplotype block that includes the entire SOCS2
gene. Five SNPs in the 5-prime region of the SOCS2 gene were
significantly associated with type II diabetes. Kato et al. (2006)
concluded that SOCS2 may play a role in susceptibility to type II
diabetes in the Japanese.

ANIMAL MODEL

Metcalf et al. (2000) generated mice deficient in Socs2 by targeted
disruption. Socs2-deficient mice were indistinguishable from their
littermates until weaning at 3 weeks of age, but subsequently grew more
rapidly. Socs2 -/- adult males were on average 40% heavier than wildtype
littermates. Adult Socs2 +/- males exhibited an intermediate body
weight. Increased growth was also significant but less marked in female
Socs2 -/- mice. Adult Socs2 -/- females typically attained the weight of
wildtype male mice, but heterozygous Socs2 females were not
significantly heavier than sex-matched wildtype littermates. Neither
male nor female Socs2 -/- mice accumulated significantly more fatty
tissue than wildtype mice. Rather, increased body weight in these mice
resulted from an increase in the weight of most visceral organs.
Sexually dimorphic or male-specific organs were not disproportionately
enlarged. Carcass weight was also significantly increased, indicating
that muscle and bone may contribute significantly to the increased size
of Socs2-deficient mice. There was significant increase in long bone
length. Tail length was normal. The increase in size was due to elevated
cell numbers rather than increased cell size. Metcalf et al. (2000)
observed a marked thickening of the dermis associated with excessive
collagen accumulation in all of 7 males, and less prominently in 6 of 8
female Socs2 -/- mice. Collagen deposition was also increased around the
bronchi and vessels of the lungs of 6 of the 9 male, but only 3 of 10
female, Socs2-deficient mice. No hematologic abnormalities were
observed. The characteristics of Socs2 -/- mice were similar to those of
mice with growth hormone (GH; 139250) excess and IGF1 (147440) excess.
Characteristics of deregulated growth hormone and IGF1 signaling,
including decreased production of major urinary protein, increased local
IGF1 production, and collagen accumulation in the dermis were observed
in Socs2-deficient mice, indicating that Socs2 may have an essential
negative regulatory role in the growth hormone/IGF1 pathway.

Turnley et al. (2002) studied the role of Socs2 in mouse neural
development. They found that Socs2 was expressed by mouse progenitor
cells and neurons in response to LIF-like cytokines. Progenitor cells
lacking Socs2 produced fewer neurons and more astrocytes in vitro. Socs2
-/- mice had fewer neurons and neurogenin-1 (NGN1; 601726)-expressing
cells in the developing cortex, whereas overexpression of Socs2
increased neuronal differentiation. Turnley et al. (2002) found that GH
inhibited Ngn1 expression and neuronal production, and this action was
blocked by Socs2 overexpression. They speculated that Socs2 promotes
neuronal differentiation by blocking GH-mediated downregulation of Ngn1.

Using GH-deficient Socs2 -/- mice, Greenhalgh et al. (2005) demonstrated
that the Socs2 -/- phenotype is dependent upon the presence of
endogenous GH. Treatment with exogenous GH induced excessive growth in
terms of overall body weight, body and bone lengths, and the weight of
internal organs and tissues. Microarray analysis on liver RNA extracts
after exogenous GH administration revealed a heightened response to GH.
The conserved C-terminal SOCS-box motif was essential for all inhibitory
function. SOCS2 was found to bind 2 phosphorylated tyrosines on the GH
receptor (600946), and mutation analysis of these amino acids showed
that both were essential for SOCS2 function. Greenhalgh et al. (2005)
concluded that SOCS2 is a negative regulator of GH signaling.

607988	TITLE *607988 SPARC/OSTEONECTIN, CWCV, AND KAZAL-LIKE DOMAINS PROTEOGLYCAN 2; SPOCK2
;;TESTICAN 2;;
KIAA0275
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Proteoglycans, which consist of a core protein and covalently linked
glycosaminoglycans, are components of the extracellular matrix. SPOCK2
encodes a member of a novel Ca(2+)-binding proteoglycan family (summary
by Vannahme et al., 1999).

CLONING

By screening an immature myeloid cell line for cDNAs with the potential
to encode large proteins, Nagase et al. (1996) identified a SPOCK2 cDNA,
which they called KIAA0275, encoding a protein with sequence similarity
to testican (SPOCK1; 602264) and with a thyroglobulin type-1 repeat.
Northern blot analysis detected highest expression in brain, thymus, and
peripheral blood leukocytes.

By screening a human brain cDNA library with a fragment of an EST
showing sequence similarity to the follistatin-like domain of a
BM-40/SPARC/osteonectin (182120), Vannahme et al. (1999) cloned a SPOCK2
cDNA, which they called testican-2, encoding a deduced precursor protein
of 424 amino acids with a 22-amino acid signal peptide and a calculated
molecular mass of 46.8 kD. The mature 402-amino acid protein has 5
domains: a follistatin-like domain, a Ca(2+)-binding domain, a
thyroglobulin-like domain, and a C-terminal region with 2 putative
glycosaminoglycan attachment sites. The SPOCK2 protein shares 43%
overall sequence identity with SPOCK1. Northern blot analysis of adult
mouse tissues revealed expression of a major 6.1-kb transcript at high
levels in brain and at low levels in lung and testis. Minor bands of 4.4
and 2.6 kb were also detected. In situ hybridization demonstrated
widespread expression in multiple neuronal cell types in olfactory bulb,
cerebral cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, cerebellum, pons, and medulla. A
recombinant fragment consisting of the Ca(2+)-binding EF-hand domain and
the thyroglobulin-like domain showed a reversible Ca(2+)-dependent
conformational change in circular dichroism studies.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1996) mapped the SPOCK2
gene to chromosome 10. By sequence analysis, Vannahme et al. (1999)
localized the gene to 10q21-q23.

607816	TITLE *607816 POLYCOMB GROUP RING FINGER PROTEIN 6; PCGF6
;;RING FINGER PROTEIN 134; RNF134;;
MEL18- AND BMI1-LIKE RING FINGER PROTEIN; MBLR
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database searching for proteins related to MEL18 (600346) and BMI1
(164831), followed by screening an adult testis cDNA library, Akasaka et
al. (2002) cloned a full-length cDNA encoding RNF134, which they called
MBLR. The deduced 352-amino acid protein contains an N-terminal
proline-rich region followed by a glutamine-rich region and a central
domain that includes a RING finger motif. MBLR does not have the
C-terminal PEST sequence found in MEL18 and BMI1. Mouse and human MBLR
share 87% sequence identity, and the central domain of MBLR shares 38%
identity with the corresponding regions of MEL18 and BMI1. Northern blot
analysis detected high expression of a 2.5-kb transcript in testis, with
lower levels in heart and very low levels in all other tissues examined.
A minor transcript of 4.5 kb was also expressed in some tissues. RT-PCR
confirmed ubiquitous expression. Western blot analysis detected
endogenous expression of a doublet of 60 and 65 kD in osteosarcoma
cells. Western blot analysis of mouse tissues detected a 60-kD protein
expressed at highest levels in testis and at lower levels in all other
tissues examined. Subcellular visualization localized MBLR in the
nucleus of interphase cells and excluded it from the nucleolus.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Akasaka et al. (2002) determined that human
MBLR interacts strongly with mouse Ring1a (RING1; 602045) and Ring1b
(RNF2), moderately with Bmi1, weakly with Mph2 (EDR2; 602979), and not
at all with Mel18. Using deletion mutants, they determined that the
interaction between MBLR and Ring1b occurred through 2 regions of each
protein. Interaction required the C termini of both proteins, the RING
finger domain of Ring1b, and a central region of MBLR that also contains
the RING finger domain. The N terminus of MBLR may also have contributed
to the interaction. Akasaka et al. (2002) found that the intracellular
localization of MBLR changed during the cell cycle. MBLR showed a
fine-grained distribution throughout the nucleoplasm in interphase
cultured cells and a fainter diffuse cytoplasmic distribution during
mitosis. MBLR was phosphorylated on ser32 during mitosis.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the MBLR
gene to chromosome 10 (TMAP SHGC-34357).

609538	TITLE *609538 PROTEIN-TYROSINE PHOSPHATASE, MITOCHONDRIAL, 1; PTPMT1
;;PTEN-LIKE PHOSPHATASE; PLIP;;
PHOSPHOINOSITIDE LIPID PHOSPHATASE
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching databases using the phosphatase domain of PTEN (601728) as
query, Pagliarini et al. (2004) identified PTPMT1, which they called
PLIP. Database analysis using the mouse ortholog, which encodes a
deduced 261-amino acid protein, revealed 60 orthologs from 4 different
phylogenetic kingdoms that share more than 70% amino acid identity
within the active site region. The active site sequence between amino
acids 128 and 148 of mouse and human PLIP is identical. Northern blot
analysis of several mouse tissues detected highest expression in testis.
In addition to testis, RT-PCR detected expression in brain, liver,
skeletal muscle, and uterus, with low levels in all other tissues
examined.

Pagliarini et al. (2005) found that mouse Ptpmt1 was targeted to
mitochondria in transfected COS-1 cells. Targeting was determined by an
N-terminal signal sequence, and Ptpmt1 was anchored to the matrix face
of the inner membrane.

GENE FUNCTION

Pagliarini et al. (2004) found that recombinant mouse Plip showed highly
selective activity against phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate
(PtdIns(5)P), with a pH optimum at 5.5. Plip showed activity against
PtdIns(5)P that was 44-fold greater than that against PtdIns(3,5)P2, its
second most preferred substrate, when the phosphoinositides were
presented in a lipid bilayer with phosphatidylserine.

Pagliarini et al. (2005) found that knockdown of Ptpmt1 expression in a
rat pancreatic insulinoma cell line altered the mitochondrial
phosphoprotein profile and enhanced both ATP production and insulin
secretion.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the PTPMT1
gene to chromosome 11 (TMAP RH47256).

607672	TITLE *607672 CARDIOTROPHIN-LIKE CYTOKINE FACTOR 1; CLCF1
;;CLC;;
B-CELL STIMULATORY FACTOR 3; BSF3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CLCF1 belongs to the interleukin-6 (IL6; 147620) family of cytokines,
which are involved in cell signaling through phosphorylation of gp130
(IL6ST; 600694). IL6 family members share similarity in gene structure
and have a 4-helix bundle in their protein structure.

CLONING

Senaldi et al. (1999) cloned BSF3, which they also referred to as novel
neurotrophin-1 (NNT1), by subtractive hybridization using a cDNA library
prepared from phorbol ester-activated Jurkat T cells. The deduced
protein contains 225 amino acids, including a 27-amino acid signal
peptide. The mature form is predicted to be a 198-amino acid peptide
with a molecular mass of 22 kD. BSF3 contains 4 cysteine residues, 2 of
which are in the signal peptide, and 1 potential N-linked glycosylation
site. The secondary structure is predicted to contain alpha helices.
BSF3 shares 19 to 27% homology with other IL6 family members and 96%
homology with mouse Bsf3. Northern blot analysis revealed a 2.2-kb
transcript expressed predominantly in lymph nodes, spleen, peripheral
blood lymphocytes, bone marrow, and fetal liver. Northern blot analysis
of mouse tissues revealed strongest expression in lymph nodes, spleen,
liver, lung, uterus, and ovary. N-terminal amino acid analysis of BSF3
expressed in HEK293 cells confirmed removal of the signal peptide.

Using cardiotrophin-1 (CTF1; 600435) as query in a database search, Shi
et al. (1999) identified a full-length clone of CLC. CLC shares 29%
identity with CTF1 and 20 to 26% identity with other neuropoietic
cytokines. Northern blot analysis detected a 1.9-kb transcript expressed
at high levels in spleen and peripheral blood leukocytes, at moderate
levels in ovary, placenta, and kidney, and at low levels in colon,
heart, lung, and pancreas. The transcript in lung was slightly smaller
than that in other tissues. Shi et al. (1999) also detected CLC clones
in cDNA libraries prepared from activated or resting neutrophils, bone
marrow stromal cells, and synovial fibroblasts.

GENE FUNCTION

Senaldi et al. (1999) found that treatment of human neuroblastoma cells
with recombinant BSF3 resulted in phosphorylation of gp130, LIFR-beta
(151443), and STAT3 (102582). BSF3 supported the survival of chick
embryo motor and sympathetic neurons in culture in a dose-dependent
manner and induced growth of murine myeloid leukemia cells. Treatment of
mice with recombinant BSF3 increased the level of serum amyloid A
(104750), potentiated the induction of corticosterone and IL6 by IL1
(see 147760), and caused body weight loss and B-cell hyperplasia with
elevated serum IgG and IgM levels.

Shi et al. (1999) found that recombinant CLC induced the activation of
NFKB (see 164011) and SRE reporter constructs in several mammalian cell
lines. The signal transduction pathway for CLC was characterized in a
neuroblastoma cell line, and tyrosine phosphorylation of gp130 and STAT1
(600555), but not STAT3, was detected.

GENE STRUCTURE

Senaldi et al. (1999) determined that the CLCF1 gene contains 3 exons
and spans approximately 6 kb.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In an Australian man with cold-induced sweating syndrome (CISS2;
610313), Rousseau et al. (2006) identified compound heterozygosity for a
truncating (607672.0001) and a missense mutation (607672.0002) in the
CLCF1 gene. The mutations were not found in 140 control chromosomes.

In 2 Hungarian sisters with CISS2, Hahn et al. (2010) identified
compound heterozygous mutations in the CLCF1 gene (607672.0003 and
607672.0004).

MAPPING

By FISH, Senaldi et al. (1999) mapped the CLCF1 gene to chromosome
11q13. By radiation hybrid analysis, Shi et al. (1999) mapped the CLCF1
gene to chromosome 11q13.3.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
COLD-INDUCED SWEATING SYNDROME 2
CLCF1, TYR107TER

In an Australian man with cold-induced sweating syndrome-2 (CISS2;
610313), Rousseau et al. (2006) identified compound heterozygosity for a
321C-A transversion and a 590G-T transversion in the CLCF1 gene,
resulting in a tyr107-to-ter (Y107X) and an arg197-to-leu (R197L;
607672.0002) substitution, respectively. The mutations were not found in
140 control chromosomes. Transfection studies demonstrated that
truncated CLC containing a stop codon at position 107 cannot be
correctly processed and expressed in mammalian cells. Functional studies
of R197L CLC revealed an incapacity for the mutant protein to bind to
CNTFR (118946) and activate subsequent signaling events; structural and
docking interaction studies showed that the R197L substitution
destabilized the contact site between CLC and CNTFR.

the CLCF1 gene: a 46T-C transition resulting in a cys16-to-arg (C16R)
substitution, and a 676T-C transition (607672.0004) resulting in the
extension of the terminal stop codon by 171 residues (X226ext171).
