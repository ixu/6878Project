300327	TITLE *300327 SYNOVIAL SARCOMA, X BREAKPOINT 5; SSX5
DESCRIPTION By screening a testis cDNA library with sequence from highly conserved
fragments of known SSX genes, Gure et al. (1997) isolated SSX5, a novel
member of the Kruppel-associated box (KRAB)-containing SSX gene family.
SSX5 encodes a deduced 188-amino acid protein that shares approximately
80% sequence identity with SSX1 (312820), SSX2 (300192), SSX3 (300325),
and SSX4 (300326). RT-PCR analysis showed restricted expression of SSX5
in testis. SSX5 was strongly expressed in 1 of 12 melanoma cell lines
tested.

147485	TITLE *147485 INTRACISTERNAL A PARTICLE-PROMOTED POLYPEPTIDE; IPP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Chang-Yeh et al. (1991) cloned and characterized a novel cellular gene
that is promoted by an intracisternal A-particle (IAP) LTR and expressed
in the mouse placenta. They referred to it as mouse IAP-promoted
placental gene (MIPP). From an 8-day-old mouse embryo cDNA library, they
isolated a 1,067-bp cDNA clone containing an IAP LTR U5 region
duplicated in its 5-prime terminus and an open reading frame coding for
a potential 202-amino acid protein. Sequence of the 5-prime region of a
genomic clone revealed the presence of a solo IAP LTR with the same U5
duplication, and primer extension analysis confirmed that transcription
of the MIPP gene is under the control of the IAP LTR. Expression of the
MIPP gene paralleled that of IAP genes in normal mouse tissues with
abundant transcripts present in the placenta.

By examining the expression of the MIPP gene in other tissues of the
midgestation mouse conceptus by Northern analysis, Mold et al. (1991)
found that expression is confined to tissues derived from 2 distinct
cell lineages, the trophectoderm and primitive endoderm. The
MIPP-encoded protein is composed of four 48-amino acid units and shares
homology with a vaccinia virus gene product. MIPP-related sequences were
also found in several mammals, including the human genome. If the same
placental-specific pattern of expression is seen in humans, an
examination of the human IPP promoter could lead to important insights
into the role of retroviruses in evolution.

MAPPING

Chang-Yeh et al. (1993) mapped the human gene to chromosome 1p32-p22 by
PCR analysis of DNAs from somatic cell hybrid panels.

By study of restriction fragment length variations (RFLV) in recombinant
inbred (RI) mice, Chang-Yeh et al. (1993) mapped the Ipp gene to distal
mouse chromosome 4.

606323	TITLE *606323 CYTOPLASMIC FMRP-INTERACTING PROTEIN 2; CYFIP2
;;p53-INDUCIBLE PROTEIN; PIR121
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

To identify novel proteins that interact with the fragile X mental
retardation protein (FMRP), encoded by the FMR1 gene (309550), Schenck
et al. (2001) used yeast 2-hybrid screening with the FMRP N terminus as
bait. They identified 2 proteins as FMRP interactors, which they called
cytoplasmic FMRP-interacting protein-1 (CYFIP1; 606322) and -2 (CYFIP2).
CYFIP2 contains 1,252 amino acids and shares 88% sequence identity with
CYFIP1. CYFIP1/2 are members of a highly conserved protein family and
share approximately 99% sequence identity with their mouse orthologs.
CYFIP1 interacts exclusively with FMRP, whereas CYFIP2 also interacts
with the FMRP-related proteins FXR1P (600819) and FXR2P (605339). The
interaction of FMRP and CYFIP involves the domain of FMRP that also
mediates homo- and heteromerization, suggesting a competition between
interaction among the FXR proteins and interaction with CYFIP. Schenck
et al. (2001) determined that CYFIP1/2 are distributed in an identical
pattern in the cytoplasm, showing colocalization with FMRP and
ribosomes. Consistent with FMRP and RAC1 localization in dendritic fine
structures, CYFIP1/2 are present in synaptosomal extracts.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the CYFIP2
gene to chromosome 5 (TMAP stSG9917).

611826	TITLE *611826 MITOCHONDRIAL RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN L11; MRPL11
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Mitochondria have their own translation system for production of 13
proteins essential for oxidative phosphorylation. MRPL11 is 1 of more
than 70 protein components of mitochondrial ribosomes that are encoded
by the nuclear genome (Kenmochi et al., 2001).

CLONING

By searching databases using bovine Mrpl11 as query, followed by PCR of
human genomic DNA, Kenmochi et al. (2001) cloned MRPL11.

GENE STRUCTURE

Zhang and Gerstein (2003) determined that the MRPL11 gene contains 5
exons.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis and analysis of an integrated BAC-STS map,
Kenmochi et al. (2001) mapped the MRPL11 gene to chromosome 11q13.3.

Zhang and Gerstein (2003) identified MRPL11 pseudogenes on chromosomes
2, 5, and 12.

185642	TITLE *185642 SURFEIT 6; SURF6
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Magoulas and Fried (1996) isolated mouse Surf6. The deduced mouse Surf6
protein contains 355 amino acids and is highly basic. Surf6 has features
common to housekeeping genes, including ubiquitous expression of its
transcript. Immunofluorescence and immunoblot analyses localized the
Surf6 protein to the nucleolus. Immunocytochemical microscopy localized
Surf6 predominantly in the nucleolar granular component, a structure
involved in ribosome maturation.

By screening a human fetal brain cDNA library with mouse Surf6, followed
by 5-prime RACE of lymphocyte RNA, Magoulas and Fried (2000) cloned
human SURF6. The deduced 361-amino acid protein has a calculated
molecular mass of 41.2 kD, is highly basic, and has putative nuclear
localization motifs. SURF6 shares 72% identity with the mouse protein.
Northern blot analysis showed ubiquitous expression of a major 2.0-kb
transcript, and a minor 4.2-kb transcript was also detected in some
tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

Magoulas et al. (1998) found that recombinant mouse Surf6 bound RNA with
high affinity and DNA with lower affinity. Immunofluorescence analysis
of synchronized mouse fibroblasts showed that Surf6 maintained a
nucleolar localization during the cell cycle, but it did not completely
colocalize with the major nucleolar proteins B23 (NPM1; 164040) and
fibrillarin (FBL; 134795) during interphase and mitosis. Magoulas et al.
(1998) proposed that SURF6 may support nucleolar matrix structure and
function via its association with nucleic acids, and that it may be
involved in processing rRNA.

Romanova et al. (2006) found that Surf6 mRNA was expressed in mouse
oocytes and was maternally inherited in the zygote. Surf6 first became
clearly visible in the nuclei of mid 2-cell embryos, where it
accumulated around nucleolar precursor bodies that were likely Cajal
(coiled) bodies. In 4- and 8-cell embryos, Surf6 remained at the
nucleolar precursor body periphery, but its localization was more
extended than in 2-cell embryos. In morulae and blastocysts, Surf6
localization was essentially similar to that in nucleoli of mouse
somatic cells. Knockdown of Surf6 expression by RNA interference led to
developmental arrest at the 8-cell/morula stage, as well as a decrease
in the level of 18S rRNA. Romanova et al. (2006) concluded that SURF6
accumulates in oocytes and embryo nuclei when they are transcriptionally
competent, and that its localization is similar but not identical to
that of B23 and fibrillarin.

GENE STRUCTURE

Magoulas and Fried (2000) determined that the SURF6 gene contains 5
exons and spans about 4.3 kb. It has at least 2 transcription start
sites. The upstream region contains a CpG island but no TATA motif, and
the intronic regions contain 4 repetitive Alu elements.

MAPPING

The SURF6 gene is located within the surfeit gene cluster in chromosome
9q34.1 (Yon et al., 1993). By sequence analysis, Magoulas and Fried
(2000) determined that the 5-prime end of the SURF6 gene and the 3-prime
end of the SURF5 gene (MED22; 185641) are separated by 3.2 kb, and that
the intergenic region contains a processed pseudogene of RPL21 (603636).

608829	TITLE *608829 SMALL UBIQUITIN-LIKE MODIFIER 4; SUMO4
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the SUMO gene family encode small ubiquitin-related modifiers
that tag proteins to modulate subcellular localization and/or enhance
protein stability and activity. The SUMO4 gene negatively regulates NFKB
(see 164011) transcriptional activity, and variation in SUMO4 is
associated with susceptibility to type I diabetes (222100).

CLONING

Bohren et al. (2004) and Guo et al. (2004) identified a SUMO-related
nucleotide sequence within intron 6 of the MAP3K7IP2 gene (605101). The
SUMO-related DNA sequence, designated SUMO4, encodes a 95-amino acid
protein with approximately 87% identity to the SUMO2 (603042) protein.
By RT-PCR of RNA from various tissues, Bohren et al. (2004) detected
SUMO4 expression mainly in adult and embryonic kidney. Guo et al. (2004)
showed by real-time PCR analysis of an immune tissue cDNA panel that
SUMO4 is expressed at various levels in immune tissues, with highest
expression in lymph node and spleen.

GENE FUNCTION

Guo et al. (2004) found that SUMO4 conjugates to IKBA (164008) and
negatively regulates NF-kappa-B (see 164011) transcriptional activity.

Bohren et al. (2004) demonstrated that SUMO4 utilizes the E2 enzyme UBC9
(601661) for sumoylation. In liver carcinoma cells transiently
transfected with SUMO4 expression vectors, Bohren et al. (2004)
demonstrated that SUMO4 carrying the met55 variant was associated with
elevated levels of activated heat-shock factor transcription factors as
compared with val55, and that the levels of NF-kappa-B were suppressed
to an identical degree. The authors confirmed a single sumoylation site
in the DNA-binding domain of HSF2 (140581) at lysine-82.

GENE STRUCTURE

The intronless SUMO4 gene is located within intron 6 of the MAP3K7IP2
gene (605101) (Bohren et al., 2004; Guo et al., 2004).

MAPPING

By merit of its inclusion within the MAP3K7IP2 gene, the SUMO4 gene maps
to 6q25 (Bohren et al., 2004; Guo et al., 2004).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Bohren et al. (2004) and Guo et al. (2004) identified a
single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the SUMO4 gene involving an
evolutionarily conserved residue (M55V; 608829.0001) that was associated
with susceptibility to type I diabetes (IDDM; 222100).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
DIABETES MELLITUS, INSULIN-DEPENDENT, 5
SUMO4, MET55VAL

Bohren et al. (2004) and Guo et al. (2004) identified an A-to-G
transition in the SUMO4 gene resulting in a met55 to val amino acid
change (M55V), at an evolutionarily conserved residue of the crucial CUE
domain. Both groups demonstrated association of the polymorphism with
susceptibility to type I diabetes (IDDM5; 600320).

Guo et al. (2004) observed that the M55V substitution resulted in 5.5
times greater NF-kappa-B transcriptional activity and in approximately 2
times greater expression of IL12B (161561), an NF-kappa-B-dependent
gene. The findings suggested a new pathway that may be implicated in the
pathogenesis of type I diabetes.

Smyth et al. (2005) and Qu et al. (2005) were unable to confirm an
association between type I diabetes and the M55V mutation; on the other
hand, in a Korean population, Park et al. (2005) showed a higher
frequency of the GG and AG genotypes in individuals with type I diabetes
(62%) than in controls (52.1%), with a relative risk of 1.5 (p less than
0.003). In reply to these reported results, Wang et al. (2005) suggested
that heterogeneity might be responsible for the differences of results.
They emphasized the importance of functional evidence providing support
for the role of susceptibility genes in disease pathogenesis and pointed
to the evidence Guo et al. (2004) provided for a reduced sumoylation
function of the 55V variant, which showed increased frequency in
individuals with type I diabetes. Wang et al. (2005) suggested that this
variant increases susceptibility for type I diabetes by reducing levels
of protective heat-shock proteins, which may have antiapoptotic effects
and a protective role in autoimmune-mediated beta-cell death during the
development of type I diabetes.

600707	TITLE *600707 SIGNAL RECOGNITION PARTICLE, 9-KD; SRP9
;;Alu RNA BINDING PROTEIN, 9-KD SUBUNIT; ALURBP
DESCRIPTION The signal recognition particle (SRP) is a ribonucleoprotein complex
that mediates the targeting of proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum
(ER). The complex consists of a 7S (or 7SL) RNA and 6 different
proteins, SRP9, SRP14 (600708), SRP19 (182175), SRP54 (604857), SRP68
(604858), and SRP72 (602122). The proteins are bound to the 7S RNA as
monomers (SRP19 and SRP54) or heterodimers (SRP9/SRP14 and SRP68/SRP72).
SRP9 and SRP14 constitute the Alu domain of 7S, whereas the other 4
proteins belong to the S domain. SRP has at least 3 distinct functions
that can be associated with the protein subunits: signal recognition,
translational arrest, and ER membrane targeting by interaction with the
docking protein.

Short interspersed elements (SINEs) are ubiquitous repetitive DNAs that
occur in the genomes of many, if not all, mammals. In humans the most
common of the SINEs are the approximately 1 million Alu sequences that
comprise as much as 5% of genomic DNA. The progenitor of the human Alu
repeat may be 7SL RNA, which is a component of the signal recognition
particle. Some Alu repeats are transcribed and the noncoding RNA is
predicted to form secondary structures. Most primate Alu sequences are
dimeric, with 2 nonidentical motifs, and contain RNA polymerase III
internal promoters followed by a poly(A) tail. Alu-mediated homologous
recombination has been implicated in a variety of genetic disorders as
have Alu sequence insertions. Some Alu transcripts are converted by
3-prime processing to a poly(A)-, monomeric species known as small
cytoplasmic (sc) Alu RNA. The 'Alu domain' of SRP consists of 2 proteins
referred to as SRP9 (9 kD) and SRP14 (600708) and the Alu-homologous
region of 7SL RNA. Information on SRP9 and SRP14 has been obtained from
the study of the genes in the dog and mouse, respectively. The human and
mouse SRP14 proteins are about 90% identical (Chang et al., 1994). Hsu
et al. (1995) cloned the human SRP9 cDNA and showed that the predicted
protein was approximately 96% similar to its canine homolog. Further,
when SRP9 was translated in vitro together with SRP14, Hsu et al. (1995)
found that Alu RNA-binding activity was reconstituted and that scAlu
RNA, 7SL RNA, and artificial transcripts that included Alu sequence
motifs were all bound with similar affinity.

For information on a signal recognition particle database, see Larsen et
al. (1998).

Weichenrieder et al. (2000) reported 2 crystal structures of the
heterodimer SRP9/14 bound either to the 5-prime domain or to a construct
containing both 5-prime and 3-prime domains of the SRP RNA.

Halic et al. (2004) presented the structure of a targeting complex
consisting of mammalian SRP bound to an active 80S ribosome carrying a
signal sequence. This structure, determined to 12-angstrom resolution by
cryoelectron microscopy, enabled Halic et al. (2004) to generate a
molecular model of SRP in its functional conformation. The model showed
how the S domain of SRP contacts the large ribosomal subunit at the
nascent chain exit site to bind the signal sequence, and that the Alu
domain reaches into the elongation factor-binding site of the ribosome,
explaining its elongation arrest activity.

171760	TITLE *171760 ALKALINE PHOSPHATASE, LIVER; ALPL
;;ALKALINE PHOSPHATASE, LIVER/BONE/KIDNEY TYPE;;
ALKALINE PHOSPHATASE, TISSUE-NONSPECIFIC; TNSALP; TNAP
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Alkaline phosphatases are membrane-bound glycoproteins that hydrolyze
various monophosphate esters at a high pH optimum (Weiss et al., 1986).
Liver/bone/kidney alkaline phosphatase, also known as tissue-nonspecific
alkaline phosphatase, acts physiologically as a lipid-anchored
phosphoethanolamine (PEA) and pyridoxal-5-prime-phosphate (PLP)
ectophosphatase (Fedde and Whyte, 1990).

See ALPQTL1 (171720) for information on quantitative trait loci
influencing the plasma level of alkaline phosphatase.

CLONING

Using quantitative inhibition and thermostability studies, Goldstein et
al. (1980) presented evidence for the existence of at least 3 distinct
forms of human alkaline phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.1): intestinal (ALPI;
171740), placental (ALPP; 171800), and liver/bone/kidney (ALPL). Harris
et al. (1974) found no genetic variants by electrophoretic means.

Weiss et al. (1986) cloned a cDNA for liver/bone/kidney alkaline
phosphatase from a human osteosarcoma cell line. The deduced 524-amino
acid ALPL protein has a presumed signal peptide of 17 amino acids and a
predicted molecular mass of 57.2 kD. The ALPL protein shares 52%
sequence identity with placental alkaline phosphatase.

GENE FUNCTION

Fedde and Whyte (1990) demonstrated that the alkaline phosphatase of
skin fibroblasts is ALPL, the tissue-nonspecific type, and that it is
active toward millimolar concentrations of the putative natural
substrates phosphoethanolamine and pyridoxal-5-prime-phosphate. Both
activities were deficient in hypophosphatasia (see 241500) fibroblasts.
They presented evidence that normal fibroblast ALP is linked to the
outside of the plasma membrane; thus, the enzyme acts physiologically as
a lipid-anchored PEA and PLP ectophosphatase.

GENE STRUCTURE

Weiss et al. (1988) and Matsuura et al. (1990) found that the ALPL gene
exists in single copy in the haploid genome and contains 12 exons
distributed over more than 50 kb. As compared with the gene isolated
using a bone-type ALPL cDNA (Weiss et al., 1988), liver-type ALPL mRNA
was found to have another leader exon about 3.4 kb upstream from exon 2
and alternative splicing in the first exon was indicated (Matsuura et
al., 1990).

MAPPING

Using human-rodent somatic cell hybrids, Swallow et al. (1985, 1986)
mapped the gene for liver/bone/kidney alkaline phosphatase to chromosome
1. Mouse Akp2, which is homologous, is on chromosome 4 between Pgm2 and
Pgd. Thus, ALPL might be located on 1p between PGM1 (171900) and PGD
(172200).

Using a DNA polymorphism of the ALPL gene, Ardinger et al. (1987) found
linkage to Rh (theta = 0.08; lod = 5.50). Multipoint analysis indicated
the following order: Rh--3--ALPL--12--GLUT--23--PGM1, with the
interlocus intervals as percent recombination in males (the female rate
about 2.8 times the male rate).

Weiss et al. (1987) assigned the ALPL locus to 1p36.1-p34 by
demonstrating linkage to Rh (maximum lod score = 5.50, theta = 0.10). In
the full report, Smith et al. (1988) established the location in
1p36.1-p34 by a combination of Southern blot analysis of hybrid cell
DNA, in situ hybridization, and genetic linkage analysis. Linkage to Rh
was indicated by a maximum lod score of 15.66 at a recombination
fraction of 0.10 and to alpha-L-fucosidase (FUCA1; 612280) by a maximum
lod score of 8.24 at a recombination fraction of 0.02.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Hypophosphatasia

In a male infant with hypophosphatasia (241500) who was born of
second-cousin parents and died at 3 months of age, Weiss et al. (1988)
identified homozygosity for a mutation in the ALPL gene (A162T;
171760.0001). Functional studies demonstrated that the mutation
abolished the expression of active enzyme.

In studies of fibroblasts from 4 unrelated patients with severe
(perinatal or infantile) hypophosphatasia (see 241500), Henthorn et al.
(1992) identified compound heterozygosity for 8 different mutations in
the ALPL gene (171760.0002-171760.0009).

Henthorn and Whyte (1992) reviewed 9 missense mutations in the ALPL gene
found in hypophosphatasia. They showed that the 9 amino acid residues
affected in these mutations are identical in all mammals examined,
indicating evolutionary conservation. Indeed, 3 of the mutations
resulted in amino acid substitutions in regions of the polypeptide that
are conserved throughout evolution, being identical in mammals, yeast,
and bacteria. Four of the mutations were observed in a single patient
and the others in only a few. The asp378-to-val mutation (171760.0009)
had the highest frequency, being found in 9 of 42 patients and none of
63 controls. Thus, the experience is similar to that in so many other
disorders in which many different allelic mutations can produce the same
or a similar phenotype.

Mornet et al. (1998) characterized tissue-nonspecific alkaline
phosphatase gene mutations in 13 European families affected by
perinatal, infantile, or childhood (241510) hypophosphatasia. Eighteen
distinct mutations were found, only 3 of which had previously been
reported, in North American and Japanese populations. Most of the 15 new
mutations were missense mutations, but they also found 2 mutations
affecting donor splice sites and 1 nonsense mutation. A missense
mutation in the last codon of the putative signal peptide probably
affected the final maturation of the protein. Despite extensive
sequencing of the gene and its promoter region, only 1 mutation was
identified in 2 cases, 1 of which was compatible with a possible
dominant effect of certain mutations and the putative role of
polymorphisms of the ALPL gene. In 12 of the 13 tested families, genetic
diagnosis was possible by characterization of the mutations or by use of
polymorphisms as genetic markers. In 2 families where clinical,
laboratory, and radiographic data were unclear, the diagnosis of
hypophosphatasia could be made, and prenatal diagnosis was performed in
1 case. Thus, severe hypophosphatasia is due to a very large spectrum of
mutations in European populations with no prevalent mutation; genetic
diagnosis must be performed by extensive analysis of the gene. Combined
with previous reports, a total of 43 ALPL mutations had been identified.

Zurutuza et al. (1999) used clinical data, site-directed mutagenesis,
and computer-assisted modeling to propose a classification of 32 ALPL
gene mutations found in 23 European patients (17 with lethal
hypophosphatasia and 6 with nonlethal hypophosphatasia). Transfection
studies of the missense mutations found in nonlethal hypophosphatasia
showed that 6 of them allowed significant residual in vitro enzymatic
activity, suggesting that these mutations corresponded to moderate
alleles. Each of the 6 patients with nonlethal hypophosphatasia carried
at least 1 of these alleles. The 3-dimensional model study showed that
moderate mutations were not found in the active site, and that most of
the severe missense mutations were localized in crucial domains such as
the active site, the vicinity of the active site, and homodimer
interface. Some mutations appeared to be organized in clusters on the
surface of the molecule that may represent candidates for regions
interacting with the C-terminal end involved in
glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) attachment or with other dimers to
form tetramers. The results of these studies showed a good correlation
between clinical forms of the disease, mutagenesis experiments, and the
3-dimensional structure study, and allowed the authors to distinguish
moderate alleles from severe alleles. They also confirmed that the
extremely high phenotypic heterogeneity observed in patients with
hypophosphatasia was due mainly to variable residual enzymatic
activities allowed by missense mutations in the gene.

Mornet (1999) studied 2 large families with adult hypophosphatasia
(146300). In 1 family, hypophosphatasia was dominantly inherited and was
due to a missense mutation in the ALPL gene. In the other family,
hypophosphatasia was recessively transmitted and was due to compound
heterozygosity of a missense mutation and a splicing mutation in the
ALPL gene. Thus, adult hypophosphatasia can be transmitted as either a
dominant or recessive trait.

Mornet (2000) stated that most of the 65 distinct mutations that had
been described to that time were missense mutations. Correlations of
genotype and phenotype had been established on the basis of clinical
data exhibited by the patients, transfection studies, computer-assisted
modeling, and examination of biochemical properties of alkaline
phosphatase in cultured fibroblasts of patients. Mornet (2000) also
discussed the dominantly inherited form of adult hypophosphatasia. It
appeared that dominant and recessive hypophosphatasia could in some
instances be due to the same mutations. The findings also suggested that
parents of patients affected with severe recessive forms of the disease
may show, in addition to the well known hypophosphatasemia, undiagnosed
mild symptoms corresponding to adult hypophosphatasia or
odontohypophosphatasia.

Lia-Baldini et al. (2001) stated that in approximately 14% of patients
tested in their laboratories, only 1 ALPL gene mutation was found,
despite exhaustive sequencing of the gene, suggesting that missing
mutations are harbored in intron or regulatory sequences or that the
disease is dominantly transmitted (see 146300). The distinction between
these 2 situations is of obvious importance to genetic counseling.
Lia-Baldini et al. (2001) studied 8 point mutations found in patients
with no other detectable mutation. Three of these mutations, G46V,
S164L, and I473F, had not previously been described; the others were
A99T (171760.0015), R167W, R206W, G232V (171760.0021), and N461I. By
means of site-directed mutagenesis, transfections in COS-1 cells, and
3-dimensional modeling, Lia-Baldini et al. (2001) evaluated the possible
dominant effect of these 8 mutations. Four exhibited dominant-negative
effect by inhibiting the enzymatic activity of the heterodimer, whereas
the other 4 did not show such inhibition. Strong inhibition resulted in
severe hypophosphatasia, whereas partial inhibition resulted in milder
forms of the disease. Analysis of the 3D model of the enzyme showed that
mutations exhibiting a dominant-negative effect were clustered in 2
regions, namely, the active site and an area probably interacting with a
region having a particular biologic function such as dimerization,
tetramerization, or membrane anchoring.

In a patient with lethal perinatal hypophosphatasia with a unique
clinical presentation of convulsions that responded to pyridoxine,
Litmanovitz et al. (2002) identified 2 mutations in the ALPL gene. One
mutation was considered to be moderate (Zurutuza et al., 1999); the
other was novel.

According to Herasse et al. (2002), the glu174-to-lys (E174K;
171760.0008) mutation in the ALPL gene is common in Caucasians, widely
distributed geographically, and present in 31% of patients with mild
hypophosphatasia.

- Odontohypophosphatasia

Herasse et al. (2003) reported 3 patients with odontohypophosphatasia
(see 146300) resulting from heterozygosity for a mutation in the ALPL
gene; 2 of the mutations had previously been reported (see A99T;
171760.0015), whereas the third, pro91 to leu, was novel (P91L;
171760.0018). The proband with the P91L mutation was 9 years old and the
other 2 were 2 years old. The 39-year-old mother of the proband with the
P91L mutation had lost her permanent teeth and had hypophosphatasia. The
38-year-old mother of the proband with the A99T mutation had an unusual
number of dental caries, numerous treatments of dental root canals, and
low serum ALP.

gene and plasma levels of vitamin B6, see 612957.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells to generate null
mutant mice, Waymire et al. (1995) found that mice lacking ALPL (which
they referred to as tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase) have normal
skeletal development. However, at approximately 2 weeks after birth,
homozygous mutant mice developed seizures that were subsequently fatal.
Defective metabolism of PLP, characterized by elevated serum PLP levels,
resulted in reduced levels of the inhibitory neurotransmitter
gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the brain. The mutant seizure
phenotype could be rescued by the administration of pyridoxal and a
semisolid diet. Waymire et al. (1995) observed at about 3 weeks of age
both a color difference and malformation of the incisor teeth in the
TNAP mutant mice who were administered pyridoxal. Significantly, TNAP is
expressed in the tissues within which incisor development takes place.
At the growth level, the teeth of the mutants were unusually white and
brittle, suggestive of hypocalcification. Between 25 and 60 days of age,
mutant animals that responded to pyridoxal injections and were fed a
high-fat solid diet started to display signs of paralysis. This
progressed to complete inability of the animals to move and death
presumably from respiratory and/or cardiac failure. During the time that
pyridoxal was being administered, the incisors became progressively more
deformed and often broke. (The feeding of a semisolid diet was intended
to maximize their food intake.) None of the mutants fed this diet
developed symptoms of paralysis; however, if pyridoxal supplementation
was withdrawn, all died from seizures within 72 hours. As in humans,
mouse TNAP functions as an ectoenzyme to convert PLP to pyridoxal.
Waymire et al. (1995) suggested that the fact that pyridoxal is
undetectable in the plasma of only rare cases of the severe perinatal
form of human hypophosphatasia is probably a reflection of the type of
mutation and the degree of residual alkaline phosphatase activity. Some
of the TNAP mutants administered pyridoxine responded to the treatment,
but the effect on longevity was minimal and mutants succumbed to
seizure-related death within 2 weeks. Whyte et al. (1988) observed
essentially the same progression in an infant with severe neonatal
hypophosphatemia who presented with seizures, had undetectable levels of
plasma pyridoxal, and was administered pyridoxine. In mammals, following
uptake, the majority of pyridoxine is phosphorylated to form pyridoxine
phosphate before being oxidized to yield pyridoxal 5-prime phosphate.
The PLP is subsequently converted to pyridoxal by alkaline phosphatase.
Very little, if any, pyridoxine is converted directly to pyridoxal.
Individuals with hypophosphatasia would not be expected to interconvert
pyridoxine to pyridoxal with any degree of efficiency and, based on the
findings in the knockout mice by Waymire et al. (1995), administration
of pyridoxal would theoretically be more appropriate. It is noteworthy
that Waymire et al. (1995) found that pyridoxal administration was
relatively ineffective in mice with certain genetic backgrounds. This
suggested the existence of genetic modifiers specific to some
backgrounds that lead to variable expressivity within the mutants on
that background. Macfarlane et al. (1992) found a similar phenomenon in
human sibs with hypoplasia. Humans and rodents fed a diet with a
high-fat content have elevated levels of circulating alkaline
phosphatase whose source is the intestinal isozyme, IAP (ALPI; 171740).
Extrapolation from the mouse model suggested to Waymire et al. (1995)
that, in those rare cases of hypophosphatasia associated with seizures,
it would be better to substitute pyridoxal for pyridoxine, and to
administer a high-fat diet to maximize IAP expression which might
compensate at least partially for loss of function of the TNAP isozyme.
However, because of the high dose of pyridoxal and the paralysis
observed in the 'knockout' mice, such treatment would need to be
carefully monitored.

In a male infant with hypophosphatasia (241500) who was born of
second-cousin parents and died at 3 months of age, Weiss et al. (1988)
identified homozygosity for a 711G-A transition in exon 6 of the ALPL
gene, resulting in an ala162-to-thr (A162T) substitution. Introduction
of this mutation into an otherwise normal cDNA by site-directed

other clinically unaffected relatives were found to be heterozygous for

(1992) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the ALPL

(E174K) substitution, and a 1309A-T transversion in exon 10, resulting

Herasse et al. (2002) investigated whether the E174K mutation had a
unique origin or multiple origins arising from de novo mutations by
genotyping 3 intragenic polymorphisms in patients with E174K and
unaffected related individuals. Because all of the E174K mutations were
found on a common ancestral haplotype, the authors suggested that a
founder mutation occurred on a single chromosome in the northwestern
Europe and spread by human migration.

Moore et al. (1999) described a family with mild hypophosphatasia,

ultrasonography detected an affected fetus with severe long bone bowing.
In contrast to the progressive deterioration typical of both the
perinatal and infantile forms of hypophosphatasia, these skeletal
defects improved spontaneously during infancy and early childhood.
Biochemical evidence of hypophosphatasia was present in this family, and
Moore et al. (1999) identified the D378V mutation in the ALPL gene of
all affected members.

1177, changing a polar glycine to an acidic aspartate (gly317-to-asp, or
G317D). A patient with a juvenile form of hypophosphatasia, with a
Mennonite mother and a non-Mennonite father, was found to be
heteroallelic for a maternally inherited gly317-to-asp allele and a
paternally inherited glu174-to-lys (171760.0008) allele. They reported

ALPL, 1-BP DEL, 1735T

In a Japanese patient with infantile hypophosphatasia (241500), Orimo et
al. (1994) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the
ALPL gene. One mutation, inherited from the mother, was a 1-bp deletion
in exon 12 (1735delT). The deletion caused a frameshift downstream from
codon 503 (leu), and the normal termination codon at 508 was eliminated.
Since a new in-frame termination codon appeared at codon 588 in the
mutant DNA, the resultant protein was predicted to have 80 additional
amino acids. The other mutation, inherited from the father, as a 1068G-A
transition in exon 9, resulting in a glu281-to-lys (E281K) substitution.

Goseki-Sone et al. (1998) studied expression of the mutant 1735delT ALPL
cDNA in COS-1 cells. They found that the protein translated from the
mutant gene had undetectable ALPL activity, and its molecular size was
larger than the wildtype protein. Detection of the mutant protein in
cells transfected with the 1735delT mutation using an immunofluorescent
method exhibited only a faint signal on the cell surface, but an intense

was a compound heterozygote for arg119 to his (R119H) and gly145 to val

In 13 affected members of a 4-generation Texas family segregating
autosomal dominant hypophosphatasia in both children (241510) and adults
(146300), Hu et al. (2000) identified heterozygosity for an ala99-to-thr
(A99T) substitution in the ALPL gene. The mutation was also found in 1
clinically unaffected individual who had an elevated urinary
phosphoethanolamine (PEA) level. Lia-Baldini et al. (2001) performed
functional studies of the A99T mutation and observed a moderate dominant
negative effect. Complete sequencing of the gene in the brother and
sister twin probands from the Texas family, including the untranslated
exon 1 and intron/exon borders, revealed no mutation other than the
heterozygous 346G-A transition in exon 5 of the ALPL gene that results
in the A99T substitution.

Herasse et al. (2003) identified the A99T mutation in heterozygous state
in a 2-year-old male and his mother; the former had only dental
manifestations and low serum alkaline phosphatase and the latter did not

The fetus was found to be a compound heterozygote: the first nucleotide

In a 15-month-old girl with a phenotype suggestive of childhood

heterozygosity for a 746G-T transversion in exon 7 of the ALPL gene,
resulting in a gly232-to-val (G232V) substitution. The mutation was
inherited from her father, who had recurrent dental caries in his 3rd
decade despite being raised with fluoridated water; the authors
suggested that this represented odontohypophosphatasia (146300).

Lia-Baldini et al. (2008) performed functional analysis of the G232V
mutation in the ALPL gene and demonstrated that the mutant protein
sequestrates some of the wildtype protein in the cells and prevents it
from reaching the membrane. These results suggested a new mechanism for
dominance in hypophosphatasia, involving mutated homodimers and
heterodimers that are sequestrated in the cells with only wildtype

older brother, who carried the same mutations, had childhood HPP

first evaluated at 19 months of age for premature tooth loss. At 18

midshaft of the right humerus, radius, and ulna. All major long bones
were subjectively of slightly narrow diameter and poorly ossified. At
birth there was bowing of the right arm with dimpling of the skin near
the apex of the bowing, but the physical examination was otherwise
unremarkable. Evidence of healing and healed fractures in the right
humerus, radius, and ulna was seen on radiographs at birth and 6 months

606359	TITLE *606359 WINGLESS-TYPE MMTV INTEGRATION SITE FAMILY, MEMBER 3A; WNT3A
DESCRIPTION The WNT gene family consists of structurally related genes encoding
secreted signaling molecules that have been implicated in oncogenesis
and in several developmental processes, including regulation of cell
fate and patterning during embryogenesis. For general information about
WNT genes, see WNT1 (164820).

CLONING

By searching databases for homologs of the mouse Wnt3a gene, Saitoh et
al. (2001) identified human WNT3A. They assembled WNT3A cDNA sequence
using cDNA-PCR. WNT3A encodes a deduced 352-amino acid protein
containing an N-linked glycosylation site and residues conserved among
members of the WNT family. The WNT3A protein shares 84.9% sequence
identity with human WNT3 (165330). By Northern blot analysis, Saitoh et
al. (2001) detected expression of a 3.0-kb WNT3A transcript at moderate
levels in placenta and at low levels in adult lung, spleen, and
prostate. They detected no WNT3A expression in any of 35 cancer cell
lines examined.

GENE STRUCTURE

Saitoh et al. (2001) determined that the WNT3A gene contains 4 exons and
spans about 53 kb of genomic DNA. WNT14 (602863) and WNT3A are clustered
in a head-to-head manner with an interval of about 58 kb.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Saitoh et al. (2001) mapped the
WNT3A gene to chromosome 1q42.

GENE FUNCTION

By analyzing the behavior of many genes involved in Wnt signaling in
chick tissue explants and whole-embryo culture experiments, Nordstrom et
al. (2002) explored the role of Wnt signaling in neural patterning. They
reported that Wnt signals act directly and in a graded manner on
anterior neural cells to induce their progressive differentiation into
caudal forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain cells. Using neural explants,
the authors observed that Wnt3A and FGF8 (600483) in combination, but
not alone, induced the expression of Wnt8c in rostral forebrain cells.
Nordstrom et al. (2002) proposed that Wnts derived from the primitive
streak and caudal paraxial mesoderm are involved in inducing the
expression of Wnt8c in neural plate cells.

Gunhaga et al. (2003) examined further the signals that induce the
initial early dorsal character of telencephalic cells. Studies in vitro
and in chick embryos showed that Wnt3A inhibited the generation of
ventral telencephalic cells and was required to induce early dorsal
characterization at the neural plate stage. Later, at the early neural
tube stage, FGF8 signaling was required to characterize the dorsal
telencephalic cells definitively, as defined by EMX1 (600034)
expression. The authors emphasized that the sequential signaling of
Wnt3A and FGF8 was required for dorsal characterization of the cells.

The morphogenesis of organs as diverse as lungs, teeth, and hair
follicles is initiated by a downgrowth from a layer of epithelial stem
cells. During follicular morphogenesis, stem cells form this bud
structure by changing their polarity and cell-cell contact. Jamora et
al. (2003) showed that this process is achieved through simultaneous
receipt of 2 external signals: a WNT protein (WNT3A) to stabilize
beta-catenin (116806), and a bone morphogenetic protein inhibitor
(Noggin; 602991) to produce Lef1 (153245). Beta-catenin binds to and
activates Lef1 transcription complexes that appear to act
uncharacteristically by downregulating the gene encoding E-cadherin
(192090), an important component of polarity and intercellular adhesion.
When either signal is missing, functional Lef1 complexes are not made,
and E-cadherin downregulation and follicle morphogenesis are impaired.
In Drosophila, E-cadherin can influence the plane of cell division and
cytoskeletal dynamics. Consistent with this notion, Jamora et al. (2003)
showed that forced elevation of E-cadherin levels block invagination and
follicle production. Jamora et al. (2003) concluded that their findings
reveal an intricate molecular program that links 2 extracellular
signaling pathways to the formation of a nuclear transcription factor
that acts on target genes to remodel cellular junctions and permit
follicle formation.

Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) have the ability to renew themselves and
to give rise to all lineages of the blood. Reya et al. (2003) showed
that the WNT signaling pathway has an important role in this process.
Overexpression of activated beta-catenin expands the pool of HSCs in
long-term cultures by both phenotype and function. Furthermore, HSCs in
their normal microenvironment activate a LEF1/TCF reporter, which
indicates that HSCs respond to WNT signaling in vivo. To demonstrate the
physiologic significance of this pathway for HSC proliferation, Reya et
al. (2003) showed that the ectopic expression of axin (603816) or a
frizzled (603408) ligand-binding domain, inhibitors of the WNT signaling
pathway, led to inhibition of HSC growth in vitro and reduced
reconstitution in vivo. Furthermore, activation of WNT signaling in HSCs
induced increased expression of HOXB4 (142965) and NOTCH1 (190198),
genes previously implicated in self-renewal of HSCs. Reya et al. (2003)
concluded that the WNT signaling pathway is critical for normal HSC
homeostasis in vitro and in vivo, and provide insight into a potential
molecular hierarchy of regulation of HSC development.

Wnt proteins are potentially important reagents in expanding specific
cell types, but in contrast to other developmental signaling molecules
such as hedgehog proteins (see 600725) and the BMPs (see 112264), Wnt
proteins have never been isolated in an active form. Although Wnt
proteins are secreted from cells, secretion is usually inefficient and
attempts to characterize Wnt proteins had been hampered by their high
degree of insolubility. Willert et al. (2003) isolated active Wnt
molecules, including the product of the mouse Wnt3a gene. By mass
spectrometry, Willert et al. (2003) found the proteins to be
palmitoylated on a conserved cysteine. Enzymatic removal of the
palmitate or site-directed and natural mutations of the modified
cysteine resulted in loss of activity, and indicated that the lipid is
important for signaling. The purified Wnt3a protein induced self-renewal
of HSCs, suggesting its potential use in tissue engineering.

The vertebral column is derived from somites formed by segmentation of
presomitic mesoderm. Both molecular oscillators (segmentation clock) and
gradients of signaling molecules control somitogenesis. Aulehla and
Herrmann (2004) reviewed the role of Wnt3a in the integration of the
segmentation clock and the signaling gradient during somitogenesis.

In studies in transgenic mice, Riccomagno et al. (2005) demonstrated
that Wnt3a and Wnt1 (164820) signaling in dorsal regions of the otic
vesicle regulates expression of genes (i.e., Dlx5/6, 600029, 600030;
Gbx2, 601135) necessary for vestibular morphogenesis. In addition, they
found that restriction of the Wnt target genes to the dorsal otocyst is
also influenced by Shh (600725). Riccomagno et al. (2005) suggested that
a balance between Wnt and Shh signaling activities is key in
distinguishing between vestibular and auditory cell types.

DasGupta et al. (2005) used a genomewide RNA interference screen in
Drosophila cells to screen for regulators of the Wnt pathway. They
identified 238 potential regulators which included known pathway
components, genes with functions not previously linked to this pathway,
and genes with no previously assigned functions. Reciprocal Best-BLAST
analyses revealed that 50% of the genes identified in the screen had
human orthologs, of which approximately 18% were associated with human
disease. Functional assays of selected genes from the cell-based screen
in Drosophila, mammalian cells, and zebrafish embryos demonstrated that
these genes had evolutionarily conserved functions in Wnt signaling.
When DasGupta et al. (2005) transfected plasmids encoding human LATS
(LATS1, 603473; LATS2, 604861), CDC2 (116940) inhibited the ability of
WNT3A to activate the Wnt-beta-cat-responsive reporter STF16 in 293T
cells. Conversely, the expression of CHX10 (142993) activated the Wnt
pathway in the presence or absence of WNT3A. When zebrafish embryos at
the 1-cell stage were injected with RNAs encoding CHX10, they developed
anterior truncations and had either small eyes or no eyes in the
majority of injected embryos. This was a phenocopy of injection of Wnt8
(see 606360). Injection of RNA encoding human LATS1 or CDC2 had an
obvious phenotype in zebrafish; however, depletion of zebrafish Lats1 by
injection of antisense morpholino oligonucleotides gave a severe
phenotype, and the embryos arrested before epiboly.

Yamamoto et al. (2006) presented evidence that LRP6 (603507) is
internalized with caveolin (CAV1; 601047) in human cell lines and that
the components of this endocytic pathway are required for WNT3A-induced
internalization of LRP6 and for accumulation of beta-catenin. The data
suggested that WNT3A triggers interaction of LRP6 with caveolin and
promotes recruitment of AXIN to LRP6 phosphorylated by GSK3B (605004)
and that caveolin thereby inhibits binding of beta-catenin to AXIN.
Yamamoto et al. (2006) concluded that caveolin plays critical roles in
inducing internalization of LRP6 and activating the WNT/beta-catenin
pathway.

Liu et al. (2007) explored the contribution of stem and progenitor cell
dysfunction and depletion to normal aging in the Klotho (604824) mouse
model. Analysis of various tissues and organs from young Klotho mice
revealed a decrease in stem cell number and an increase in progenitor
cell senescence. Because Klotho is a secreted protein, Liu et al. (2007)
postulated that Klotho might interact with other soluble mediators of
stem cells. They found that Klotho bound to various Wnt family members.
In a cell culture model, the Wnt-Klotho interaction resulted in the
suppression of Wnt biologic activity. Tissues and organs from
Klotho-deficient animals showed evidence of increased Wnt signaling, and
ectopic expression of Klotho antagonized the activity of endogenous and
exogenous Wnt. Both in vitro and in vivo, continuous Wnt exposure
triggered accelerated cellular senescence. Thus, Liu et al. (2007)
concluded that Klotho appears to be a secreted Wnt antagonist and that
Wnt proteins have an unexpected role in mammalian aging.

Brack et al. (2007) showed that muscle stem cells (satellite cells) from
aged mice tend to convert from a myogenic to a fibrogenic lineage as
they begin to proliferate and that this conversion is mediated by
factors in the systemic environment of the old animals. Brack et al.
(2007) also showed that this lineage conversion is associated with an
activation of the canonic Wnt signaling pathway in aged myogenic
progenitors and can be suppressed by Wnt inhibitors. Furthermore,
components of serum from aged mice that bind to the Frizzled family of
proteins, which are Wnt receptors, may account for the elevated Wnt
signaling in aged cells. Brack et al. (2007) concluded that the Wnt
signaling pathway may play a critical role in tissue-specific stem cell
aging and an increase in tissue fibrosis with age.

By screening a human kinase small interfering RNA library, Pan et al.
(2008) identified phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase type II-alpha (PI4K2A;
609763) and phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase type I (PIP5KI;
603275) as required for Wnt3a-induced LRP6 (603507) phosphorylation at
ser1490 in mammalian cells and confirmed that these kinases are
important for Wnt signaling in Xenopus embryos. Wnt3a stimulates the
formation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphates through 'frizzled'
(see 603408) and 'dishevelled' (see 601365), the latter of which
directly interacted with and activated PIP5KI. In turn,
phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphates regulated phosphorylation of LRP6
at thr1479 and ser1490. Pan et al. (2008) concluded that their study
revealed a signaling mechanism for Wnt to regulate LRP6 phosphorylation.

Gattinoni et al. (2009) reported that induction of Wnt/beta-catenin
signaling by inhibitors of Gsk3b or by Wnt3a arrested mouse Cd8 (see
186910)-positive T-cell development into effector T cells capable of
cytotoxicity or Ifng (147570) production. Instead, Wnt signaling
promoted expression of Tcf7 (189908) and Lef1 and generation of
self-renewing multipotent Cd8-positive memory stem cells capable of
proliferation and antitumor activity. Gattinoni et al. (2009) concluded
that Wnt signaling has a key role in maintaining the self-renewing stem
cell-like properties of mature memory CD8-positive T cells.

Using RT-PCR and flow cytometric analysis, Zhao et al. (2010)
demonstrated that mouse Tcf7 and Lef1 were highly expressed in naive T
cells, downregulated in effector T cells, and upregulated in memory T
cells. Memory Cd8-positive T cells expressing the p45 Tcf7 isoform and
beta-catenin (116806) had enhanced Il2 (147680) production capacity and
enhanced effector capacity to clear Listeria monocytogenes. Zhao et al.
(2010) concluded that constitutive activation of the Wnt pathway favors
memory CD8 T-cell formation during immunization, resulting in enhanced
immunity upon a second encounter with the same pathogen.

Using a genetic approach, Driessens et al. (2010) found no evidence that
the beta-catenin pathway regulates T-cell memory phenotype, in contrast
with the findings of Gattinoni et al. (2009). The findings of Driessens
et al. (2010) suggested that the generation of Cd8-positive memory stem
cells observed by Gattinoni et al. (2009) with the use of Gsk3b
inhibitors was not a consequence of activation of the beta-catenin
pathway, but was rather due activation of another Gsk3b-dependent
pathway. In a reply, Gattinoni et al. (2010) noted that others,
including Zhao et al. (2010) and Jeannet et al. (2010), had also
identified Wnt and beta-catenin as crucial factors in postthymic
Cd8-positive T-cell differentiation and memory development. Using
Western blot analysis, Gattinoni et al. (2010) showed that addition of
Wnt3a or Gsk3b inhibitor stabilized beta-catenin in primed Cd8-positive
mouse T cells.

Using human and mouse cells and Xenopus oocytes, Taelman et al. (2010)
showed that WNT signaling triggered sequestration of GSK3 from the
cytosol into multivesicular bodies and thereby inhibited protein
degradation by sequestering GSK3 from cytosolic substrates. Addition of
WNT3A reduced endogenous cytosolic GSK3 activity, and endocytosed WNT3A
colocalized with GSK3 in acidic endosomal vesicles. Depletion of GSK3A
(606784) and GSK3B in HEK293 cells protected the same range of proteins
as WNT3A treatment. Depletion of the endosomal sorting proteins HRS
(HGS; 604375) or VPS4 (see 609982) also reduced GSK3 endocytosis and
inhibited WNT signaling. The GSK3 substrate beta-catenin was required
for endocytosis of the GSK3-containing complex, as was the kinase
activity of GSK3. Taelman et al. (2010) concluded that rising
beta-catenin levels during WNT signaling function in a positive-feedback
loop by facilitating GSK3 sequestration, allowing newly translated
beta-catenin to accumulate in the nucleus.

Spence et al. (2011) established a robust and efficient process to
direct the differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells into
intestinal tissue in vitro using a temporal series of growth factor
manipulations to mimic embryonic intestinal development. Using this
culture system as a model to study human intestinal development, Spence
et al. (2011) identified that the combined activity of WNT3A and FGF4
(164980) is required for hindgut specification, whereas FGF4 alone is
sufficient to promote hindgut morphogenesis. Spence et al. (2011)
concluded that human intestinal stem cells form de novo during
development. Spence et al. (2011) also determined that NEUROG3 (604882)
is both necessary and sufficient for human enteroendocrine cell
development in vitro.

Cooper et al. (2011) observed that mesenchymal cells cultured in the
combination of the 3 signaling molecules retinoic acid, Fgf8 (600483),
and Wnt3a to which early limb cells are normally exposed maintain the
capacity to form both proximal and distal structures despite the passage
of time and continued proliferation. This strongly argues against a
mechanism linking proximodistal specification to a cell cycle-based
internal clock. Cooper et al. (2011) concluded that the trigger for
initiating the process of specification of the zeugopod and autopod is
the cessation due to displacement of retinoic acid exposure. Similar
conclusions were independently reached by Rosello-Diez et al. (2011).
Using heterotopic transplantation of intact and recombinant chick limb
buds, Rosello-Diez et al. (2011) identified signals in the embryo trunk
that proximalize distal limb cells to generate a complete proximodistal
axis. In these transplants, retinoic acid induces proximalization, which
is counteracted by fibroblast growth factors from the distal limb bud;
these related actions suggested that the first limb bud proximodistal
regionalization results from the balance between proximal and distal
signals.

Zhang et al. (2012) found that full-length Xenopus and human TIKI1
(TRABD2A; 614912) and TIKI2 (TRABD2B; 614913) and their secreted
N-terminal ectodomains functioned as Wnt antagonists in Xenopus embryos,
HEK293T cells, and mouse L cells. Depletion of TIKI2 in HEK293T cells
via small interfering RNA enhanced WNT3A-induced reporter expression,
and the effect was reversed by expression of TIKI1. WNT3A produced in L
cells and HEK293T cells was secreted into the culture medium in the
presence of TIKI1 and TIKI2; however, secreted WNT3A lacked 8 N-terminal
amino acids essential for Wnt activity, and it formed large inactive
extracellular aggregates linked by intermolecular disulfide bonds. In
contrast, knockdown of TIKI2 in HEK293T cells reduced WNT3A cleavage.
Zhang et al. (2012) concluded that the protease activity associated with
TIKI1 and TIKI2 counters WNT3A signaling.

Huang et al. (2013) found that ectopic RIPK4 (605706), but not
catalytically inactive or Bartsocas-Papas (263650) RIPK4 mutants,
induced accumulation of cytosolic beta-catenin (116806) and a
transcription program similar to that caused by WNT3A. In Xenopus
embryos, Ripk4 synergized with coexpressed Xenopus Wnt8, whereas Ripk4
morpholinos or catalytic inactive Ripk4 antagonized Wnt signaling. RIPK4
interacted constitutively with the adaptor protein DVL2 (602151) and,
after WNT3A stimulation, with the coreceptor LRP6 (603507).
Phosphorylation of DVL2 by RIPK4 favored canonical Wnt signaling.
WNT-dependent growth of xenografted human tumor cells was suppressed by
RIPK4 knockdown, suggesting that RIPK4 overexpression may contribute to
the growth of certain tumor types.

601929	TITLE *601929 ATPase, Ca(2+)-TRANSPORTING, UBIQUITOUS; ATP2A3
;;SARCOPLASMIC RETICULUM Ca(2+)-ATPase 3; SERCA3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPases (SERCAs), such as ATP2A3, are
membrane-spanning proteins that transport Ca(2+) across membranes
bordering Ca(2+)-sequestering stores, such as the sarcoplasmic or
endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Isoform diversity results by alternative
processing of the primary gene transcripts in a developmentally
modulated or tissue-specific manner.

CLONING

Dode et al. (1996) isolated cDNA and genomic clones of human SERCA3. The
deduced 109,237-Da protein contains 999 amino acids and is 94% similar
to rat SERCA3. Northern blot analysis provided evidence for alternative
processing of the SERCA3 transcript.

By RT-PCR, Santiago-Garcia et al. (1996) found variable expression of
the PMCA (see 108731) and SERCA genes during human fetal heart
development. SERCA3 was expressed at relatively constant levels at all
stages of fetal heart development examined and in adult heart and
placenta.

Poch et al. (1998) cloned 2 SERCA3 splice variants from a kidney cDNA
library and a Jurkat T-cell line cDNA library. The deduced proteins,
which contain 999 and 1,029 amino acids, both have 10 transmembrane
domains but differ at their C termini. They also cloned a third variant
encoding a 998-amino acid protein that differs from the 999-amino acid
protein at 3 amino acids; however, the origin of this variant was
unclear. Northern blot analysis detected a major transcript of about 5
kb expressed at highest levels in thymus, colon, pancreas, and spleen.
Intermediate to low expression was detected in all other tissues
examined. The SERCA3 proteins localized in the nuclear envelope and in
the ER throughout human embryonic kidney and Jurkat T-cell lines.

Dode et al. (1998) identified 3 SERCA3 splice variants that encode
proteins with 999, 1,043, and 1,024 amino acids. The proteins, which the
authors designated SERCA3a, SERCA3b, and SERCA3c, respectively, differ
only in their C termini. Mouse Serca3 is also expressed as 3 variants of
similar size.

By RT-PCR of human platelets, Martin et al. (2002) identified and cloned
2 additional SERCA3 splice variants, which they designated SERCA3d and
SERCA3e. The deduced proteins contain 1,044 and 1,052 amino acids,
respectively, and differ from each other and the previously identified
SERCA3 isoforms only in their C termini. RT-PCR detected all 5 SERCA3
splice variants in platelets, lung, and pancreas. Heart, brain,
placenta, and kidney expressed 3 or 4 splice variants, and skeletal
muscle expressed only 1 variant. Variation was also found in the
expression of SERCA3 variants in established cell lines.

Bobe et al. (2004) identified a sixth SERCA3 variant, which they
designated SERCA3f, that lacks exon 21 but retains exon 22. The deduced
SERCA3f protein contains 1,033-amino acids and differs from the other
SERCA3 isoforms at the C terminus. RT-PCR detected SERCA3f expression in
all tissues and cell lines examined.

GENE FUNCTION

Following isolation of the microsome fraction of transfected human
embryonic kidney cells, Poch et al. (1998) demonstrated that proteins
encoded by 2 SERCA3 splice variants supported Ca(2+) uptake and ATPase
activity.

Martin et al. (2002) found that all 5 SERCA3 isoforms pumped Ca(2+) with
similar affinities, and all pumped Ca(2+) toward the ER. However, the
isoforms modulated cytosolic Ca(2+) concentrations and ER Ca(2+)
concentrations differently. Martin et al. (2002) concluded that the
SERCA3 isoforms have widespread roles in cellular Ca(2+) signaling.

Gelebart et al. (2002) found that expression of SERCA3 was significantly
reduced or lost in colon carcinomas compared with normal colonic
epithelial cells. Treatment of tumor cells with butyrate or other
differentiation inducers resulted in increased SERCA3 expression,
whereas SERCA2 (ATP2A2; 108740) expression was unaltered or was reduced.
SERCA3 expression was increased along with other differentiation markers
during spontaneous post-confluence differentiation of a colon carcinoma
cell line.

Because the SERCA3b and SERCA3f isoforms diverge at the beginning of the
C-terminal domain but share the same last 21 amino acids, Bobe et al.
(2004) investigated the relationship between structure, function, and
location of these isoforms. Immunofluorescence and/or confocal
microscopy showed that SERCA3f and SERCA3b localized in overlapping but
distinct ER locations. By transfection in human embryonic kidney cells,
Bobe et al. (2004) found that SERCA3b and SERCA3f created distinct
resting cytosolic Ca(2+) concentrations and ER Ca(2+) content. SERCA3b
and SERCA3f showed similar sensitivity to a SERCA inhibitor and similar
kinetics of Ca(2+) release and reuptake. They both demonstrated low
apparent Ca(2+) affinity and enhanced rates of dephosphorylation of the
phosphoenzyme intermediate relative to other SERCA Ca(2+) channels.

GENE STRUCTURE

Dode et al. (1998) determined that the ATP2A3 gene contains 22 exons and
spans more than 50 kb. Exon 21 is subject to alternative splicing and
may be included, partially included, or excluded. The promoter region
has no TATA box, but it has 14 putative Sp1 (189906) sites, 11 CACCC
boxes, 5 AP2 (107580)-binding motifs, 3 GGCTGGGG motifs, 3 CANNTG boxes,
a GATA (see 305371) site, and single sites for ETS1 (164720), MYC
(190080), and TFIIIC (see 603246). The authors showed that the GC-rich
region was critical for SERCA3 transcription in Jurkat cells.

Martin et al. (2002) identified a novel exon within what was previously
reported as the last intron of ATP2A3, indicating that the ATP2A3 gene
contains 23 exons.

MAPPING

Dode et al. (1996) assigned the ATP2A3 gene to human chromosome 17p13.3
by fluorescence in situ hybridization.

ANIMAL MODEL

Liu et al. (1997) found that Serca3-null mice were viable, fertile, and
did not exhibit an overt disease phenotype. However, mutant aortic ring
preparations showed diminished acetylcholine-induced intracellular
Ca(2+) signaling and relaxation, with reduced Ca(2+) transient and
nitric oxide production. Their response to other modifiers of vascular
tone was unaltered. Liu et al. (1997) concluded that SERCA3 plays a role
in Ca(2+) signaling mechanisms that mediate endothelium-dependent
relaxation of vascular smooth muscle.

Serca3 expression is restricted to beta cells in mouse pancreas.
Arredouani et al. (2002) found the Serca3 ablation was insufficient in
itself to alter glucose homeostasis or impair insulin secretion in mice.
However, Serca3 ablation altered the reuptake of Ca(2+) into the ER and
increased the insulin response of islets to glucose.

613534	TITLE *613534 FANCD2/FANCI-ASSOCIATED NUCLEASE 1; FAN1
;;MYOTUBULARIN-RELATED PROTEIN 15; MTMR15;;
KIAA1018
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

FAN1 is a DNA endo- and exonuclease involved in the repair of DNA damage
caused by crosslinking agents. FAN1 is recruited to sites of interstrand
cross linkage damage by interacting with the FANCI (611360)-FANCD2
(227646) complex (MacKay et al., 2010; Kratz et al., 2010; Smogorzewska
et al., 2010).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1999) cloned FAN1, which they designated
KIAA1018. The deduced protein contains 1,017 amino acids. RT-PCR
analysis detected relatively uniform FAN1 expression in all adult and
fetal tissues and specific adult brain regions examined.

Kratz et al. (2010) stated that the FAN1 protein contains a predicted
N-terminal RAD18 (605256)-like ubiquitin (191339)-binding zinc finger
domain and a C-terminal nuclease domain.

Zhou et al. (2012) found expression of the FAN1 gene in multiple
parenchymatous human tissues, including the kidney, liver, neuronal
tissue, and female reproductive organs. The expression pattern differed
from that of FANCD2, which was found primarily in lymphatic and bone
marrow-derived sources, as well as in skin and testes.

GENE FUNCTION

Using tandem affinity purification and large-scale immunoprecipitation
analysis, followed by mass spectroscopy, Cannavo et al. (2007)
identified FAN1 as a protein that interacted with the mismatch repair
proteins MLH1 (120436), PMS1 (600258), and PMS2 (600259).

Independently, MacKay et al. (2010) and Kratz et al. (2010) found that
recombinant human FAN1 exhibited DNA endonuclease activity toward
5-prime flaps and had 5-prime exonuclease activity mediated by its
C-terminal nuclease domain. Only DNA damage caused by interstrand
crosslinking agents resulted in recruitment of FAN1 to sites of DNA
damage, and this recruitment required interaction of FAN1 with
monoubiquitinated FANCD2. Depletion of FAN1 sensitized human cell lines
to interstrand crosslinking agents and caused chromosomal instability.
Smogorzewska et al. (2010) reported similar findings and showed that
FAN1 required both FANCI and FANCD2 for localization at sites of DNA
damage.

A central event in the Fanconi pathway is monoubiquitylation of the
FANCI-FANCD2 protein complex. Liu et al. (2010) characterized FAN1,
which promotes interstrand crosslink repair in a manner strictly
dependent on its ability to accumulate at or near sites of DNA damage
and that relies on monoubiquitylation of the FANCI-FANCD2 complex. Liu
et al. (2010) concluded that the monoubiquitylated complex recruits the
downstream repair protein FAN1 and facilitates repair of DNA interstrand
crosslinks.

MAPPING

Using radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1999) mapped the FAN1
gene to chromosome 15.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of 9 unrelated families with karyomegalic
interstitial nephritis (KMIN; 614817), Zhou et al. (2012) identified 12
different homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the FAN1 gene
(see, e.g., 613534.0001-613534.0008). Eight of the 12 mutations resulted
in a truncated protein. The first mutation was identified by
homozygosity mapping and exome sequencing in 1 affected family. Upon
exposure to mitomycin C, FAN1 mutant cells showed genomic instability,
as manifest by increased chromatid breaks and radial chromosomes on
metaphase spreads. Although the results of the test for Fanconi anemia
(see, e.g., 227650), diepoxybutane-induced breakage, were negative in
FAN1-mutant cells lines, these cells still showed decreased survival in
response to either inducer of interstrand crosslink repair (ICL)
compared to controls. Thus, there were subtle differences in cell
reaction between FANCA (607139)-mutant and FAN1-mutant cells, suggesting
that these proteins act in somewhat distinct manners. None of the FAN1
mutant proteins was able to correct mitomycin C-induced decreased
survival in cells lacking FAN1 nuclease activity. Morpholino knockdown
of Fan1 in zebrafish embryos resulted in a nephronophthisis (NPHP;
256100)-like phenotype, with shortened and curved body axis, as well as
a Fanconi anemia-like phenotype, with microcephaly, microphthalmia, and
massive apoptosis. There was evidence of activation of the DNA damage
repair pathway, as demonstrated by increased signaling for gamma-H2AX
(H2AFX; 601772). Knockdown of born Fan1 and p53 (191170) in zebrafish
caused renal cysts, reminiscent of a ciliopathy. In the fawn-hooded
hypertensive rat, an animal model of chronic kidney disease, as well as
in kidney samples from humans with genetically heterogeneous forms of
chronic kidney disease, Zhou et al. (2012) found increased nuclear
staining for gamma-H2AX, indicating activation of the DNA damage
response pathway. These findings supported the hypothesis that DNA
lesions and DNA damage response pathways may partially drive renal
damage in NPHP-related ciliopathies and in chronic kidney disease.

In affected members of 2 French families with karyomegalic interstitial

heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the FAN1 gene. Both families carried a
T-to-A transition in intron 2 (1234+2T-A), resulting in a splice site
mutation on 1 allele. One family (Godin et al., 1996) carried a 2-bp
deletion in exon 7 (2036_7delGA; 613534.0003) on the second allele, and
the other family carried a 2245C-T transition in exon 9, resulting in an
arg749-to-ter (R749X; 613534.0004) substitution on the second allele.
None of the mutations were found in 96 controls, and haplotype analysis
suggested a founder effect for the splice site mutation.

cAMP-GEFII;;
EPAC2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Cyclic AMP is a second messenger that induces a wide range of responses
in different cell types, including activation of the RAS-related GTPase
RAP1A (179520). Using differential display for brain-enriched genes
related to signaling in striatum, and by screening for second messenger
motifs, Kawasaki et al. (1998) obtained cDNAs encoding cAMP-regulated
guanine nucleotide exchange factor I (cAMP-GEFI; 606057) and cAMP-GEFII.
Sequence analysis predicted that the 1,011-amino acid cAMP-GEFII protein
contains an N-terminal cAMP-binding domain and a C-terminal GEF domain.
Expression of cAMP-GEFI and cAMP-GEFII activated RAP1A after forskolin
and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine stimulation, independent of the protein
kinase A (see 176911) pathway. cAMP-GEFI and cAMP-GEFII expression did
not activate or only slightly activated other RAS superfamily members
after stimulation. Northern blot analysis detected expression of a
4.4-kb cAMP-GEFII transcript that was most prominent in brain and
adrenal gland. Within the brain, expression was strongest in cortex,
occipital pole, frontal lobe, temporal lobe, amygdala, putamen,
hippocampus, and cerebellum. In situ hybridization analysis demonstrated
strong expression of cAMP-GEFII in mature as well as developing rat
brain, with high levels in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, habenula,
and cerebellum.

GENE FUNCTION

Epac2, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the small guanosine
triphosphatase Rap1, is activated by adenosine
3-prime,5-prime-monophosphate (cAMP). Zhang et al. (2009) used
fluorescence resonance energy transfer and binding experiments to
demonstrate that sulfonylureas, widely used antidiabetic drugs, interact
directly with Epac2. Sulfonylureas activated Rap1 (605061) specifically
through Epac2. Sulfonylurea-stimulated insulin secretion was reduced
both in vitro and in vivo in mice lacking Epac2, and the
glucose-lowering effect of the sulfonylurea tolbutamide was decreased in
these mice. Zhang et al. (2009) concluded that Epac2 contributes to the
effect of sulfonylureas to promote insulin secretion. Because Epac2 is
also required for the action of incretins, gut hormones crucial for
potentiating insulin secretion, it may be a promising target for
antidiabetic drug development.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

-  Crystal Structure

Rehmann et al. (2006) reported the 3-dimensional structure of
full-length EPAC2, a 110-kD protein that contains an N-terminal
regulatory region with 2 cyclic nucleotide-binding domains and a
C-terminal catalytic region. The structure was solved in the absence of
cAMP and showed the autoinhibited state of EPAC. The regulatory region
is positioned with respect to the catalytic region by a rigid,
tripartite beta-sheet-like structure Rehmann et al. (2006) referred to
as the 'switchboard' and an ionic interaction called the 'ionic latch.'
As a consequence of this arrangement, the access of Rap to the catalytic
site is sterically blocked. Mutational analysis suggests a model for
cAMP-induced EPAC activation with rigid body movement of the regulatory
region, the features of which are universally conserved in
cAMP-regulated protein.

Rehmann et al. (2008) determined the structure of EPAC2 in complex with
a cAMP analog (Sp-cAMPS) and RAP1B (179530) by x-ray crystallography and
single-particle electron microscopy. The structure represents the
cAMP-activated state of the EPAC2 protein with the RAP1B protein trapped
in the course of the exchange reaction. Comparison with the inactive
conformation revealed that cAMP binding causes conformational changes
that allow the cyclic nucleotide binding domain to swing from a position
blocking the Rap binding site towards a docking site at the Ras exchange
motif domain.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Bacchelli et al. (2003) found 4 rare nonsynonymous variants in the
cAMP-GEFII gene in 5 families from the International Molecular Genetic
Study of Autism Consortium (IMGSAC). These variants segregated with the
autistic phenotype (209850) and were not observed among controls.
However, the significance of these findings was unclear since, overall,
the frequency of the variants was low in the IMGSAC families.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Chromogranin A (CHGA) regulates catecholamine storage and release
through intracellular (vesiculogenic) and extracellular (catecholamine
release--inhibitory) mechanisms (summary by Wen et al., 2004).

CLONING

Kruggel et al. (1985) determined the N-terminal sequences of bovine and
human adrenal medullary chromogranin A; the sequences are identical to
each other and also to the published sequence of secretory protein I.

Deftos et al. (1986) cloned a cDNA for CHGA using mRNA from
CHGA-producing medullary thyroid carcinoma cells in an expression
vector, lambda gt11. Konecki et al. (1987) isolated a full-length clone
encoding human chromogranin A from a lambda-gt10 cDNA library of a human
pheochromocytoma. The nucleotide sequence showed that human chromogranin
A is a 439-residue protein preceded by an 18-residue signal peptide.
Sequence findings suggested that pancreastatin is derived from
chromogranin A itself rather than from a protein that is only similar to
chromogranin A. The pancreastatin sequence contained in human
chromogranin A is flanked by sites for proteolytic processing. In man,
pancreastatin may be important for the physiologic homeostasis of blood
insulin levels as well as pathologic aberrations such as diabetes
mellitus.

GENE STRUCTURE

Wu et al. (1991) found that the chromogranin A gene has 8 exons and 7
introns spanning about 11 kb.

MAPPING

Murray et al. (1987) mapped CHGA to chromosome 14 by probing DNA from a
hybrid cell panel with specific cDNA. Using a cDNA clone for the
chromogranin A gene, Modi et al. (1989) mapped the gene to 14q32 by
Southern blot analysis of human-rodent somatic cell hybrid DNAs and by
in situ hybridization.

Simon-Chazottes et al. (1993) demonstrated that the chromogranin A gene
is present in single dose in both the mouse and rat. Analysis of the
allele distribution in an interspecific mouse backcross by single-strand
conformation polymorphism positioned the Chga locus on mouse chromosome
12. By study of a rat/mouse somatic cell hybrid panel, they determined
that the corresponding gene is on rat chromosome 6. In each case (mouse,
rat, and human), chromogranin A is encoded in a conserved region with
nearby markers, including the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus.

GENE FUNCTION

Chromogranin A is a protein costored and coreleased with catecholamines
from storage granules in the adrenal medulla. Secretory protein I
(parathyroid secretory protein; PSP) is a protein costored and
coreleased with parathyroid hormone (PTH) from storage granules in the
parathyroid gland. Like PTH (168450), its secretion is inversely
proportional to extracellular calcium concentration. Bhargava et al.
(1983) showed that the degree of phosphorylation of PSP is also
inversely proportional to serum calcium, and that PSP is the major
phosphorylated protein released by the parathyroid gland. Cohn et al.
(1982) demonstrated a close similarity of these 2 proteins in amino acid
composition, physical properties, and immunologic crossreactivity.

O'Connor and Deftos (1986) showed that chromogranin A is secreted by a
great variety of peptide-producing endocrine neoplasms:
pheochromocytoma, parathyroid adenoma, medullary thyroid carcinoma,
carcinoids, oat-cell lung cancer, pancreatic islet-cell tumors, and
aortic-body tumor.

Using immunohistochemistry on plastic sections, Cetin et al. (1993)
investigated the occurrence and cellular distribution of CHGA,
pancreastatin, and chromostatin (CST), a CHGA-derived bioactive peptide,
in human endocrine pancreas of healthy and disease states and in the
adrenal medulla. In the normal and diabetic pancreas, CST
immunoreactivity was localized exclusively in beta cells, which were
mostly unreactive for PST and CHGA. Both latter peptides were confined
mainly to glucagon (alpha) cells. Insulinoma cells displayed strong
insulin, PST, and CHGA immunoreactivities, but they were faintly
immunoreactive for CST or unreactive. Adrenal chromaffin cells exhibited
strong immunoreactivity for CHGA but lacked CST and PST
immunoreactivities. Based on the peculiar distribution pattern of CST,
PST, and CHGA, Cetin et al. (1993) suggested that CHGA is differentially
processed in chromaffin and islet tissues and in insulinoma cells. The
unique cellular localization of CST in the endocrine pancreas of normal
and pathologic conditions may indicate that CST is involved in beta-cell
function.

Kim et al. (2001) presented evidence that regulation of dense-core
secretory granule biogenesis and hormone secretion in endocrine cells is
dependent on CGA. Downregulation of CGA expression in a neuroendocrine
cell line, PC12, by antisense RNAs led to profound loss of dense-core
secretory granules, impairment of regulated secretion of a transfected
prohormone, and reduction of secretory granule proteins. Transfection of
bovine Cga into a CGA-deficient PC12 clone rescued the regulated
secretory phenotype. Stable transfection of CGA into a CGA-deficient
pituitary cell line, 6T3, which lacks a regulated secretory pathway,
restored regulated secretion. Overexpression of CGA induced dense-core
granules, immunoreactive for CGA, in nonendocrine fibroblast CV-1 cells.
Kim et al. (2001) concluded that CGA is an 'on/off' switch that alone is
sufficient to drive dense-core secretory granule biogenesis and hormone
sequestration in endocrine cells.

Catestatin is a 21-amino acid neuroendocrine antimicrobial peptide
fragment of CHGA that has effects on human autonomic function. It
exhibits 3 naturally occurring polymorphisms: gly364 to ser (G364S),
pro370 to leu (P370L), and arg374 to gln (R374Q). Aung et al. (2011)
reported that catestatin and its variants all caused human mast cells
and a human mast cell line to migrate, degranulate, and release
leukotriene C4 (see 246530) and prostaglandins D2 (see 602598) and E2
(see 608152). The catestatins also increased intracellular Ca(2+)
mobilization and induced production of proinflammatory
cytokines/chemokines, including GMCSF (CSF2; 138960), CCL2 (158105),
CCL3 (182283), and CCL4 (182284), which could be blocked by G protein,
phospholipase C (see 172420), or ERK (see 601795) inhibitors. Inhibition
of mast cell CHRNA7 (118511) did not affect catestatin-mediated
activation of mast cells. Aung et al. (2011) concluded that catestatin
may have immunomodulatory functions and link neuroendocrine and
cutaneous immune systems.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Nobels et al. (1997) evaluated the clinical usefulness of chromogranin
A, termed CgA by the authors, as a neuroendocrine serum marker. Serum
levels of CgA, neuron-specific enolase (NSE), and the alpha-subunit of
glycoprotein hormone (alpha-SU) were determined in 211 patients with
neuroendocrine tumors and 180 control subjects with nonendocrine tumors.
The concentrations of CgA, NSE, and alpha-SU were elevated in 50%, 43%
and 24% of patients with neuroendocrine tumors, respectively. Serum CgA
was most frequently increased in subjects with gastrinomas (100%),
pheochromocytomas (89%), carcinoid tumors (80%), nonfunctioning tumors
of the endocrine pancreas (69%), and medullary thyroid carcinomas (50%).
The highest levels were observed in subjects with carcinoid tumors; NSE
was most frequently elevated in patients with small cell lung carcinoma
(74%) and alpha-SU was most frequently elevated in patients with
carcinoid tumors (39%). A significant positive relationship was
demonstrated between the tumor load and serum CgA levels (P less than
0.01, by X2 test). Elevated concentrations of CgA, NSE, and alpha-SU
were present in, respectively, 7%, 35%, and 15% of control subjects.
Markedly elevated serum levels of CgA, exceeding 300 mu-g/L, were
observed in only 3 (2%) control patients compared to 76 (40%) patients
with neuroendocrine tumors. The authors concluded that CgA was the best
general neuroendocrine serum marker available at that time.

Granberg et al. (1999) measured CgA in 36 patients with type I multiple
endocrine neoplasia (MEN1; 131100), of whom 9 lacked pancreatic
involvement, 20 had biochemical evidence of pancreatic endocrine tumors,
and 7 displayed radiologically detectable pancreatic tumors. CgA was
also analyzed in 25 patients with sporadic pancreatic endocrine tumors,
39 subjects with inflammatory bowel disease, 7 patients harboring
nonendocrine pancreatic disease, and 19 healthy controls. Of the MEN1
patients without pancreatic involvement, 4 of 9 (44%) had elevated CgA.
Furthermore, 60% with biochemically unequivocal tumors and all with a
radiologically visible tumor showed elevations. All 25 patients with
sporadic pancreatic endocrine tumors had increased CgA, as did 28% of
patients with inflammatory bowel disease and 57% with nonendocrine
pancreatic disease. Granberg et al. (1999) concluded that nonendocrine
diseases can cause elevations of CgA, and its spontaneous variation can
be considerable. While plasma CgA is the most sensitive of the basal
markers for neuroendocrine tumors, the authors felt that it could not
replace other established measures when screening for early pancreatic
involvement in MEN1.

GENE FAMILY

Neurons and neuroendocrine cells contain membrane-delimited pools of
peptide hormones, biogenic amines, and neurotransmitters with a
characteristic electron-dense appearance on transmission electron
microscopy. These vesicles, which are present throughout the
neuroendocrine system and in a variety of neurons, store and release
chromogranins and secretogranins (also known as granins), a unique group
of acidic, soluble secretory proteins. The 3 'classic' granins are
chromogranin A, which was first isolated from chromaffin cells of the
adrenal medulla; chromogranin B (CHGB; 118920), initially characterized
in a rat pheochromocytoma cell line; and chromogranin C (CHGC; 118930),
also known as secretogranin II, which was originally described in the
anterior pituitary. Taupenot et al. (2003) reviewed aspects of the
structures, biochemical properties, and clinical importance of granins,
with particular emphasis on chromogranin A. They made reference to 4
other acidic secretory proteins considered members of the granin family
(Huttner et al., 1991): secretogranin III (Ottiger et al., 1990),
secretogranin IV (Krisch et al., 1986), secretogranin V (SGNE1; 173120)
(Mbikay et al., 2001), and secretogranin VI (GNAS; 139320) (Ischia et
al., 1997).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Chromogranin A regulates catecholamine storage and release through
intracellular (vesiculogenic) and extracellular (catecholamine release
inhibitory) mechanisms. CHGA is a candidate gene for autonomic
dysfunction syndromes, including intermediate phenotypes that contribute
to hypertension. Wen et al. (2004) sequenced the CHGA gene in 180
ethnically diverse individuals with no history of renal failure and
found a surprising pattern of CHGA variants that alter the expression
and function of this gene, both in vivo and in vitro. Functional
variants included both common alleles that qualitatively alter gene
expression and rare alleles that qualitatively change the encoded
product to alter the signaling potency of CHGA-derived
catecholamine-release inhibitory catestatin peptides.

ANIMAL MODEL

Mahapatra et al. (2005) generated Chga-null mice and observed decreased
chromaffin granule size and number; elevated blood pressure; loss of
diurnal blood pressure variation; increased left ventricular mass and
cavity dimensions; decreased adrenal catecholamine, neuropeptide Y (NPY;
162640), and ATP contents; increased catecholamine/ATP ratio in the
chromaffin granule; and increased plasma catecholamine and NPY levels.
Return of elevated blood pressure to normal levels was achieved by
either exogenous catestatin replacement or expression of a human CHGA
transgene. Mahapatra et al. (2005) concluded that CHGA has a definitive
role in autonomic control of the circulation.

DESCRIPTION Eukaryotic translation initiation factors (EIFs) initiate protein
synthesis from mRNAs. EIF3, at 650 kD, is the largest of the EIFs.
According to Johnson et al. (1997), EIF3 has been implicated in several
roles, including binding to the 40S ribosomal subunit and to other EIFs,
possibly to align the factors for initial binding to the 40S subunit and
the subsequent identification of the AUG initiation codon. The EIF3
protein synthesis initiation factor is composed of at least 8 subunits,
the largest of which is p180.

CLONING

Nagase et al. (1995) identified an open reading frame with significant
homology to mouse centrosomin B. Nagase et al. (1995) noted that this
clone, which they termed KIAA0139, was ubiquitously expressed and
contained 21 units of an unusual 10-amino acid repeat. The full-length
cDNA was later cloned and characterized independently by Johnson et al.
(1997) and Scholler and Kanner (1997). Johnson et al. (1997) used
expression screening of a human liver cDNA library to isolate a clone,
which they termed p180. The cDNA predicted a protein of 1,382 amino
acids, which Johnson et al. (1997) identified as the human homolog of
centrosomin, the large subunit of mouse eif3. Johnson et al. (1997) also
showed that p180 has homologs in yeast, nematodes, and plants. Scholler
and Kanner (1997) used expression screening of a human T-cell cDNA
library to isolate a clone, termed p167 by them, that was nearly
identical to that isolated by Johnson et al. (1997). Scholler and Kanner
(1997) showed that p167 was a cytoplasmic protein that is not
phosphorylated and is part of a multisubunit complex.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a library of endoribonuclease-prepared short interfering RNAs
(esiRNAs), Kittler et al. (2004) identified 37 genes required for cell
division, one of which was EIF3S10. These 37 genes included several
splicing factors for which knockdown generates mitotic spindle defects.
In addition, a putative nuclear-export terminator was found to speed up
cell proliferation and mitotic progression after knockdown.

Holz et al. (2005) showed that MTOR (FRAP1; 601231) and S6K1 (RPS6KB1;
608938) maneuvered on and off the EIF3 translation initiation complex in
HEK293 cells in a signal-dependent, choreographed fashion. When
inactive, S6K1 associated with the EIF3 complex, while the S6K1
activator MTOR, in association with its binding partner RAPTOR (607130),
did not. Hormone- or mitogen-mediated cell stimulation promoted
MTOR/RAPTOR binding to the EIF3 complex and phosphorylation of S6K1.
Phosphorylation resulted in S6K1 dissociation and activation, followed
by phosphorylation of S6K1 targets, including EIF4B (603928), which,
upon phosphorylation, was recruited into the EIF3 complex. Holz et al.
(2005) concluded that the EIF3 preinitiation complex acts as a scaffold
to coordinate responses to stimuli that promote efficient protein
synthesis.

MAPPING

Nagase et al. (1995) mapped the KIAA0139 clone to human chromosome 10.
By FISH, Ensinger et al. (1998) mapped the EIF3A gene to 10q26.

607462	TITLE *607462 ATROPHIN 1; ATN1
;;DRPLA GENE; DRPLA
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

In the search for a candidate gene for dentatorubral-pallidoluysian
atrophy (DRPLA; 125370), an inherited neurodegenerative disorder that
demonstrates genetic anticipation characteristic of unstable expansion
of trinucleotide repeats, Koide et al. (1994) searched a catalog of
genes expressed in human brain identified by Li et al. (1993) that
contained trinucleotide repeats. One of these, B37, which was known to
map to chromosome 12, was examined and found to show CAG repeat
expansion (607462.0001) in 22 individuals with DRPLA. By screening adult
human occipital cortex and fetal human brain cDNA libraries, Onodera et
al. (1995) isolated a full-length DRPLA cDNA encoding a deduced
1,185-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 125 kD. The
(CAG)n repeat that is expanded in patients with DRPLA is located at
position 1462 and is predicted to code for a polyglutamine tract. There
was high heterozygosity of the length of the polyglutamine tract,
ranging from 8 to 35 repeat units in 140 normal chromosomes. Northern
blot analysis revealed a 4.7-kb transcript that is widely expressed in
various tissues, including heart, lung, kidney, placenta, skeletal
muscle, and brain.

Using antibodies against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the
sequence of the C-terminus of the DRPLA gene product, Yazawa et al.
(1995) identified the DRPLA gene product in normal human brains as a
protein of approximately 190 kD. They also found a larger protein of
approximately 205 kD specifically in DRPLA brains.
Immunohistochemically, the DRPLA gene product was observed mainly in
neuronal cytoplasm. These results demonstrated the existence of the
expanded CAG repeat gene product and supported the possibility that the
expanded CAG-encoded polyglutamine stretch may participate in the
pathologic process of similar trinucleotide repeat diseases.

Schmitt et al. (1995) isolated the complete coding sequence of the rat
DRPLA gene and investigated its expression in different developmental
stages of rodent tissues. In rat, the length of the (CAG)n repeat is 7
to 34 repeats with an average of 15, which is mildly reduced in
comparison with the human repeats. Northern blot analysis demonstrated
that in rodents the gene is already expressed during embryonic
development. In addition, the transcript is predominantly represented in
neuronal tissues throughout all developmental stages investigated. Oyake
et al. (1997) cloned a mouse Drpla cDNA and found that the encoded
protein is 92% identical to human DRPLA.

MAPPING

Takano et al. (1996) assigned the DRPLA gene to chromosome 12p13.31 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization.

Oyake et al. (1997) mapped the mouse Drpla gene to chromosome 6 by
interspecific backcross analysis.

GENE FUNCTION

Burke et al. (1996) demonstrated that synthetic polyglutamine peptides,
DRPLA protein and huntingtin (613004) from unaffected individuals with
normal-sized polyglutamine tracts bind to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (138400). The authors postulated that diseases
characterized by the presence of an expanded CAG repeat may share a
common metabolic pathogenesis involving GAPD as a functional component.
Roses (1996) and Barinaga (1996) reviewed the findings.

Using the yeast 2-hybrid system, Wood et al. (1998) identified 5
atrophin-1 interacting proteins that bind to atrophin-1 in the vicinity
of the polyglutamine tract. Four of the interactions were confirmed
using in vitro binding assays. These interactors were found to be
similar to huntingtin-interacting proteins, suggesting possible
commonality of function between the 2 proteins responsible for the very
similar diseases, Huntington disease (HD; 143100) and DRPLA.

Zhang et al. (2002) characterized a Drosophila gene encoding an atrophin
family protein. Analysis of mutant phenotypes indicated that Drosophila
atrophin is required in diverse developmental processes, including early
embryonic patterning. Drosophila atrophin genetically interacts with the
transcription repressor 'even-skipped' (see 142991) and is required for
its repressive function in vivo. Drosophila atrophin directly binds to
even-skipped in vitro. Furthermore, both human atrophin-1 and Drosophila
atrophin repress transcription in vivo when tethered to DNA, and poly-Q
expansion in atrophin-1 reduces this repressive activity.

Okamura-Oho et al. (2003) determined that the DRPLA protein is a
phosphoprotein and that c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK; see 601158) is
one of the major factors involved in its phosphorylation.
Phosphorylation was demonstrated in a recombinant JNK activation system
in vitro and also in overexpressing cells by transfection after JNK
activation with osmotic pressure. Phosphorylation of serine-734 in the
DRPLA protein was confirmed by a specific antibody raised against the
phosphopeptide. Kinetic studies in the JNK recombinant system showed
that expanded polyQ slightly reduced the affinity of JNK to the protein.

Using yeast 2-hybrid screens, coaffinity purification analysis of
transfected HEK293 cells, and bioinformatic analysis, Lim et al. (2006)
developed an interaction network for 54 human proteins involved in 23
inherited ataxias. By database analysis, they expanded the core network
to include more distantly related interacting proteins that could
function as genetic modifiers. RBPMS (601558) was a main hub in the
network and interacted with many proteins, including the cerebellar
ataxia-associated proteins ATN1 and QK1 (609590).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 22 patients with dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (125370), Koide
et al. (1994) identified unstable expansion of a CAG unit in the ATN1
gene (607462.0001), which they termed B37 after a cDNA clone previously
identified by Li et al. (1993). Each patient was a heterozygote with 1
allele in the normal range (8-25 repeat units) and a second expanded
allele with the range of 54-68 repeat units. There were no overlaps in
the number of CAG repeat units between control chromosomes and DRPLA
chromosomes. In 33 patients with DRPLA from 12 families, Nagafuchi et
al. (1994) identified an expanded CAG repeat in the B37 clone. The
repeat size varied from 7-23 in normal individuals and 1 allele was
expanded to between 49-75 repeats in affected individuals.

Burke et al. (1994, 1994) demonstrated that affected members of the
large African American family with Haw River syndrome had the same
trinucleotide repeat expansion (607462.0001) in the ATN1 gene as that
found in DRPLA.

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

Martins et al. (2003) stated that DRPLA is prevalent in Japan, but
several families of non-Japanese ancestry had been published. To
identify the origin of expanded alleles in 4 Portuguese families with
DRPLA, they studied 2 intragenic SNPs in introns 1 and 3, in addition to
the CAG repeat, of the DRPLA gene. The results showed that all 4
families shared the same haplotype, which was the same as that reported
for Japanese DRPLA chromosomes. This haplotype is also the most frequent
in Japanese normal alleles, whereas it was rare in Portuguese control
chromosomes. The findings supported the suggestion that a founder DRPLA
haplotype of Asian origin was introduced in Portugal and is responsible
for the frequency of the disease in that country.

- Genetic Anticipation

Koide et al. (1994) found a good correlation between the size of the
(CAG)n repeat expansion and the age of onset. Patients with earlier
onset tended to have a phenotype of progressive myoclonic epilepsy and
larger expansions. They proposed that the wide variety of clinical
manifestations of DRPLA can be explained by the variable unstable
expansion of the CAG repeat. Although only 5 cases of paternal
transmission and 2 cases of maternal transmission were analyzed, the
length of the repeat unit was altered in all cases: the average change
in repeat length for paternal transmission was an increase of 4.2
repeats, while that of maternal transmission was a decrease of 1.0
repeat.

Nagafuchi et al. (1994) also found that repeat size correlated closely
with age of onset of symptoms and with disease severity. Expansion was
usually associated with paternal transmission. Komure et al. (1995)
analyzed CAG trinucleotide repeats in 71 individuals from 12 Japanese
DRPLA pedigrees that included 38 affected individuals. Normal alleles
varied from 7 to 23 repeats, whereas affected individuals had from 53 to
88 repeats. Like Koide et al. (1994) and Nagafuchi et al. (1994), they
found a significant negative correlation between CAG repeat length and
age of onset. In 80% of the paternal transmissions, there was an
increase of more than 5 repeats, whereas all the maternal transmissions
showed either a decrease or an increase of fewer than 5 repeats.

Aoki et al. (1994) demonstrated that anticipation with expansion of the
CAG repeat can occur through mothers as well as through fathers. They
investigated 2 families in which offspring showed progressive myoclonic
epilepsy with onset in childhood. In 1 family, patients of the first
generation showed mild cerebellar ataxia with onset at 52 to 60 years. A
patient of the second generation, the mother, showed severe ataxia with
onset in the early thirties. The offspring in the third generation
showed mental retardation, convulsions and myoclonus beginning at age 8.
Sano et al. (1994) studied 4 families and also demonstrated
anticipation. Older-onset patients suffered from cerebellar ataxia with
or without dementia, whereas younger-onset patients presented as
progressive myoclonus epilepsy syndrome, consisting of mental
retardation, dementia, and cerebellar ataxia as well as epilepsy and
myoclonus. Anticipation with paternal transmission was significantly
greater than with maternal transmission.

Sato et al. (1995) reported homozygosity for a modest (57-repeat)
triplet repeat in a man with early onset of DRPLA at age 17. His parents
were first cousins and were neurologically normal at ages 73 and 71, in
spite of having 57 CAG repeats in heterozygous state. Four of the
proband's sibs died at age 12 with the phenotype of progressive
myoclonic epilepsy. These findings supported the hypothesis that the
clinical features of DRPLA, like those of Machado-Joseph disease, are
influenced by the dosage of expansion of triplet repeats, unlike
Huntington disease, in which the homozygous state does not appear to be
different clinically from the heterozygous state.

Norremolle et al. (1995) described a Danish family in which affected
persons in at least 3 generations had been thought to be suffering from
Huntington disease. Because analysis of the huntingtin gene revealed
normal alleles and because some of the patients had seizures, they
analyzed the B37 gene and found significantly elongated CAG repeats, as
had been reported in cases of DRPLA. Norremolle et al. (1995) reported
that affected persons with almost identical repeat lengths presented
very different symptoms. Both expansion and contraction in paternal
transmission was observed.

Ikeuchi et al. (1996) analyzed the segregation patterns of 411
transmissions of 24 DRPLA pedigrees and 80 transmissions in 7
Machado-Joseph disease (MJD; 109150) pedigrees, with the diagnoses
confirmed by molecular testing. Significant distortions in favor of
transmission of the mutant alleles were found in male meiosis, where the
mutant alleles were transmitted to 62% of all offspring in DRPLA (P less
than 0.01) and 73% in MJD (P less than 0.01). The results were
considered consistent with meiotic drive in both disorders. The authors
commented that since more prominent meiotic instability of the length of
the CAG trinucleotide repeats is observed in male meiosis than in female
meiosis and since meiotic drive is observed only in male meiosis, these
results raised the possibility that a common molecular mechanism
underlies the meiotic drive and the meiotic instability in male meiosis.

On the basis of studies in an extensively affected Tennessee family,
Potter (1996) emphasized the intrafamilial variability and lack of close
correlation between age of onset and (CAG)n repeat number in this
disease. The studies were done on DNA derived from leukocytes;
tissue-specific instability (somatic mosaicism) has been reported in
DRPLA.

Takiyama et al. (1999) determined the CAG repeat size in 427 single
sperm from 2 men with DRPLA. The mean variance of the change in the CAG
repeat size in sperm from the DRPLA patients (288.0) was larger than any
variances of the CAG repeat size in sperm from patients with
Machado-Joseph disease (38.5), Huntington disease (69.0), and spinal and
bulbar muscular atrophy (16.3; 313200), which is consistent with the
clinical observation that the genetic anticipation on the paternal
transmission of DRPLA is the most prominent among CAG repeat diseases.
The variance was different in the 2 patients (51.0 vs 524.9, P greater
than 0.0001). The segregation ratio of normal to expanded allele sperm
was 1:1.

ANIMAL MODEL

To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying CAG repeat
instability, Sato et al. (1999) established 3 transgenic lines, each
harboring a single copy of a full-length human mutant DRPLA gene
carrying a CAG repeat expansion. These transgenic mice exhibited an
age-dependent increase (+0.31 per year) in male transmission and an
age-dependent contraction (-1.21 per year) in female transmission.
Similar tendencies in intergenerational instabilities were also observed
in human DRPLA parent-offspring pairs. The intergenerational
instabilities of the CAG repeats may be interpreted as being derived
from the instability occurring during continuous cell division of
spermatogonia in the male, and that occurring during the period of
meiotic arrest in the female. The transgenic mice also exhibited an
age-dependent increase in the degree of somatic mosaicism that occurred
in a cell lineage-dependent manner, with the size range of CAG repeats
being smaller in the cerebellum than in other tissues, including the
cerebrum, which was consistent with observations in autopsied tissues of
DRPLA patients. Thus, the transgenic mice described by Sato et al.
(1999) exhibited age-dependent intergenerational and somatic
instabilities of expanded CAG repeats comparable with those observed in
human DRPLA patients, and should therefore serve as good models for
investigating the molecular mechanisms of instabilities of CAG repeats.

In comparing transgenic mice bearing either full-length atrophin-1 or
partial huntingtin trans-proteins to wildtype, Luthi-Carter et al.
(2002) reported that there was considerable overlap in the alteration of
gene expression between the 2 models, at least in the cerebellum. The
authors concluded that polyglutamine-induced changes may be independent
of their protein context.

Sato et al. (2009) generated a DRPLA Q129 mouse resulting from en masse
expansion of the 76 CAG repeat in a Q76 mouse breeding program. Only the
Q129 mice exhibited devastating progressive neurologic phenotypes
similar to those of juvenile-onset DRPLA patients. Electrophysiologic
studies demonstrated age-dependent and region-specific presynaptic
dysfunction in the globus pallidus and cerebellum. Progressive shrinkage
of distal dendrites of Purkinje cells and decreased currents through
AMPA receptors (see 138248) and GABA-A (see 137160) receptors in CA1
neurons were also observed. The Q129 mice developed progressive brain
atrophy but no obvious neuronal loss, associated with massive neuronal
intranuclear accumulation (NIA) of mutant proteins with expanded polyQ
stretches starting on postnatal day 4, whereas NIA in the Q76 mice
appeared later with regional specificity to the vulnerable regions of
DRPLA. Expression profile analysis demonstrated age-dependent
downregulation of genes, including those relevant to synaptic functions
and CREB (123810)-dependent genes. Sato et al. (2009) suggested that
neuronal dysfunction without neuronal death is the essential
pathophysiologic process and that the age-dependent NIA is associated
with nuclear dysfunction including transcriptional dysregulations.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
DENTATORUBRAL-PALLIDOLUYSIAN ATROPHY
ATN1, (CAG)n EXPANSION

In 22 patients with dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA;
125370), Koide et al. (1994) identified unstable expansion of a CAG unit
in the DRPLA gene, which they termed B37 after a cDNA clone previously
identified by Li et al. (1993). Each patient was a heterozygote with 1
allele in the normal range (8-25 repeat units) and a second expanded
allele with the range of 54-68 repeat units. There were no overlaps in
the number of CAG repeat units between control chromosomes and DRPLA
chromosomes.

Burke et al. (1994, 1994) demonstrated that affected members of the
large African American family with Haw River syndrome had a
trinucleotide repeat expansion in the ATN1 gene that was identical to
that found in DRPLA, a frequent disorder in Japanese but rare in
Europeans. In addition to the difference in racial frequency, the
clinical expression and pathology of Haw River syndrome differed from
that of the disease as observed in the Japanese: seizures were a
consistent feature, there was no myoclonus, basal ganglion calcification
was common, and neuronal loss was prominent in the globus pallidus.
Burke et al. (1994, 1994) suggested that the difference in racial
frequency is probably due to differences in the repeat size. The
frequency of the repeat allele of intermediate size was very low in
Europeans, somewhat higher in African Americans, and relatively high
(5-10%) in Japanese.

PHOSPHOLIPASE A2, SECRETORY, CALCIUM-DEPENDENT, GROUP X; GXSPLA2
DESCRIPTION The A2 phospholipases (PLA2s; EC 3.1.1.4) catalyze the release of fatty
acids from phospholipids and play a role in a wide range of physiologic
functions. Cupillard et al. (1997) cloned a novel secretory PLA2, termed
GXSPLA2, from a human fetal lung cDNA library. The sequence encodes a
165-amino acid polypeptide, including the 42-amino acid signal peptide.
Northern blot analysis revealed that GXSPLA2 expresses an 0.8-kb mRNA in
pancreas, lung, and colon and a 1.5-kb mRNA in spleen, thymus, and
peripheral blood leukocytes. Expression studies showed that the cDNA
encodes an active phospholipase which was secreted into the culture
medium.

Cupillard et al. (1997) used in situ hybridization to map the PLA2G10
gene to human chromosome 16p13.1-p12.

606158	TITLE *606158 BSCL2 GENE; BSCL2
;;SEIPIN;;
GNG3LG, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

BSCL2, or seipin, is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident protein that
is induced in late stages of preadipocyte differentiation and is
predicted to function in lipid droplet formation and/or metabolism (Cui
et al., 2011).

CLONING

Within a 2.5-Mb critical region for Berardinelli-Seip congenital
lipodystrophy type 2 (BSCL2; 269700), Magre et al. (2001) identified a
gene that is homologous to the mouse 'gamma-3-linked gene' (Gng3lg).
Magre et al. (2001) found that the BSCL2 open reading frame encodes a
deduced 398-amino acid protein, seipin, with at least 2 hydrophobic
amino acid stretches, indicating that it could be a transmembrane
protein. It has 87% identity to the mouse Gng3lg product, and partial
homology to Drosophila CG9904 protein. Using Northern blot analysis,
Magre et al. (2001) observed highest expression in brain and testis.
Dot-blot analysis indicated that the BSCL2 gene is highly expressed in
most regions of the central nervous system. Magre et al. (2001)
identified a putative initiation codon located in the second exon.
Agarwal and Garg (2004) noted that an alternative upstream initiation
codon could extend the seipin protein by 64 amino acids at the putative
N terminus.

By Northern blot analysis, Windpassinger et al. (2004) detected a 1.8-kb
brain-specific transcript in all brain regions examined and a 2.2-kb
transcript in placenta, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, and
pancreas. Fluorescence microscopy showed seipin and calreticulin
(109091) colocalized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of transfected
human umbilical vein endothelial cells. They identified a conserved
N-glycosylation site at residues 88 to 90.

Lundin et al. (2006) found that the predominant form of seipin is 462
residues in length, and is generated by an initiation site upstream of
the site found originally.

By immunoblot analysis of mouse and human cells transfected with
full-length BSCL2, Ito and Suzuki (2007) detected full-length seipin as
a 74-kD band and N- and C-terminal fragments of seipin between 35 and 48
kD, suggesting that seipin is highly modified after translation. Seipin
immunoreactivity was present in anterior horns of mouse spinal cord and
clearly localized to the endoplasmic reticulum. Transiently expressed
human seipin appeared to be be proteolytically cleaved into an
N-terminal fragment, and full-length seipin was polyubiquitinated in
cultured neuronal and nonneuronal cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Ito et al. (2008) found expression of seipin in cortical neurons of
human frontal lobe and motor neurons of human spinal cord. Seipin
immunostaining was also observed specifically in mouse spermatids and
cells of the anterior lobe of the mouse pituitary gland. Cellular
studies in HeLa cells and mouse neuroblastoma cells indicated that
seipin has a glycosylated loop facing the ER lumen with both N and C
termini facing the cytosol. The first transmembrane domain is necessary
for ER retention. Neuronal and nonneuronal cells expressing the N88S
(606158.0013) and S90L (606158.0014) mutant proteins showed that both
mutant proteins localized correctly. Mutant cells also contained
inclusion bodies that were found to be distinct from aggresomes. The
second transmembrane domain was found to be critical for inclusion
formation, and both transmembrane domains were critical for activation
of the unfolded protein response (UPR). In a review of the function of
seipin and its role in disease, Ito and Suzuki (2009) noted that seipin
is an N-glycosylated protein that is proteolytically cleaved into N- and
C-terminal fragments and is polyubiquitinated.

GENE STRUCTURE

Magre et al. (2001) determined that the BSCL2 gene contains 11 exons
spanning at least 14 kb.

MAPPING

Magre et al. (2001) reported that the BSCL2 gene is homologous to the
mouse 'gamma-3-linked gene' (Gng3lg), which is localized in the region
of mouse chromosome 19 orthologous to human 11q. By positional cloning,
they located the BSCL2 gene within a 2.5-Mb critical region for a form
of Berardinelli-Seip congenital lipodystrophy.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Congenital Generalized Lipodystrophy type 2

In chromosome 11q13-linked families with congenital generalized
lipodystrophy type 2, and in 3 isolated patients, Magre et al. (2001)
identified mutations in the BSCL2 gene (606158.0001-606158.0012). Most
of the variants were null mutations predicted to result in the severe
disruption of the protein. Affected individuals were either homozygous
for a specific mutation or compound heterozygous; all parents of
unaffected sibs carried only 1 mutation. Magre et al. (2001) did not
find any mutation in affected individuals of the 9 families in which
BSCL is not linked to 11q13 or in 13 additional patients who had been
diagnosed with Lawrence syndrome (Lawrence, 1946), in which lipoatrophy
is not present at birth but develops at a later age.

Fu et al. (2004) screened for mutations in AGPAT2 (603100) and BSCL2 in
27 families with congenital generalized lipodystrophy. They found
mutations in either AGPAT2 or BSCL2 in all but 4 probands. Eighteen
patients with congenital generalized lipodystrophy from 15 families from
the same region of northeastern Brazil were homozygous for a frameshift
mutation in BSCL2 (669insA; 606158.0006). Despite having the same
mutation, the subjects had widely divergent clinical manifestations. Fu
et al. (2004) concluded that there did not appear to be any
distinguishing clinical characteristics between subjects with congenital
generalized lipodystrophy with AGPAT2 or BSCL2 mutations, with the
exception of mental retardation in carriers of BSCL2.

Szymanski et al. (2007) screened a yeast deletion library for aberrant
lipid droplets and found that absence of yeast seipin resulted in
irregular lipid droplets often clustered alongside proliferated ER;
giant lipid droplets were also seen. Electron microscopy showed abnormal
small irregular lipid droplets in fibroblasts from a BSCL2 patient with
a 5-bp deletion (606158.0005). In yeast, almost all lipid droplets
appeared to be on the ER, and seipin was found at these junctions. Human
seipin could functionally replace yeast seipin, but A212P
(606158.0009)-mutant human seipin that causes lipodystrophy could not.
Szymanski et al. (2007) hypothesized that seipin is important for lipid
droplet maintenance and perhaps assembly.

- Distal Hereditary Motor Neuropathy type VA and Silver Syndrome

In a large Austrian family with distal hereditary motor neuropathy type
VA (DSMAVA; 600794) reported by Auer-Grumbach et al. (2000),
Windpassinger et al. (2003) established linkage of the disorder to
11q12-q14, a chromosomal region overlapping that of Silver spastic
paraplegia syndrome (SPG17; 270685). Windpassinger et al. (2004)
confirmed linkage to the SPG17 locus in 16 additional families with a
phenotype characteristic of Silver syndrome. After refining the critical
region to 1 Mb, Windpassinger et al. (2004) sequenced the BSCL2 gene,
which lies within that region, and identified heterozygous mutations in
the family with DSMAV and those with SPG17. The mutations, asn88 to ser
(N88S; 606158.0013) and ser90 to leu (S90L; 606158.0014), affect
glycosylation of seipin and result in aggregate formation leading to
neurodegeneration. Windpassinger et al. (2004) noted that both DSMAV and
Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2D (CMT2D; 601472) had already been
associated with mutation in the GARS gene (600287), indicating genetic
heterogeneity. Their findings indicated that Silver syndrome and some
forms of dHMN are, in fact, extreme phenotypes resulting from mutations
in the same gene. Both conditions are genetically heterogeneous, as some
individuals with each phenotype did not carry a BSCL2 mutation.

By in vitro functional expression analysis, Ito and Suzuki (2007)
demonstrated that the N88S and S90L mutations in the BSCL2 gene disrupt
glycosylation of the seipin protein. Overexpressed mutant seipin was
highly ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome, and improper
glycosylation exacerbated endoplasmic reticulum retention. Mutant
proteins activated the unfolded protein response, resulting in apoptotic
cell death through ER stress. Ito and Suzuki (2007) concluded that the
N88S and S90L mutations, which result in motor neuron disease, have a
gain-of-function effect, resulting in conformational protein changes,
activation of the unfolded protein response, cell death, and
neurodegeneration.

ANIMAL MODEL

Cui et al. (2011) obtained seipin -/- mice at the expected mendelian
ratio. Seipin -/- mice were growth delayed, but they eventually achieved
normal weight. They showed significantly reduced adipose tissue mass,
including about 60% reduction in brown adipose tissue, glucose
intolerance, hyperinsulinemia, and hepatic steatosis, with elevated
expression of select lipogenic genes. Levels of leptin (LEP; 164160) and
adiponectin (ADIPOQ; 605441) were significantly decreased in seipin -/-
mice, as were nonesterified fatty acids upon fasting.
Hypertriglyceridemia, which is common in human BSCL, was not observed in
seipin -/- mice.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
LIPODYSTROPHY, CONGENITAL GENERALIZED, TYPE 2
BSCL2, 2-BP DEL/3-BP INS, NT536

In 2 families with Berardinelli-Seip congenital lipodystrophy (269700),
1 from eastern Norway and 1 from Italy, Magre et al. (2001) found
homozygosity for a mutation in exon 2 of the BSCL2 gene, the replacement
of 2 CC nucleotides at position 536 with 3 nucleotides (GGA), resulting
in a frameshift following phenylalanine-63 with a termination codon at
amino acid 75. They also found the mutation in heterozygous state in 2
affected families from southwestern Norway and the United Kingdom,
respectively. The phenotype presented at birth in the Norwegian and U.K.
families and before 9 months of age in the Italian family.

.0002
LIPODYSTROPHY, CONGENITAL GENERALIZED, TYPE 2
BSCL2, 2-BP INS, 645AA

In a consanguineous Brazilian family with Berardinelli-Seip congenital
lipodystrophy (269700), Magre et al. (2001) found homozygosity for an
insertion of 2 adenines at nucleotide 645 of the BSCL2 gene, resulting
in a frameshift and premature termination at codon 111.

.0003
LIPODYSTROPHY, CONGENITAL GENERALIZED, TYPE 2
BSCL2, 2-BP DEL, 659GT

In a French family segregating Berardinelli-Seip congenital
lipodystrophy (269700), Magre et al. (2001) identified compound
heterozygosity for mutations in the BSCL2 gene: deletion of 2 basepairs
(GT) at nucleotide 659, resulting in frameshift and premature
termination at codon 112; and a 258-bp deletion/12-bp insertion in exons
5-6 (606158.0004).

LIPODYSTROPHY, CONGENITAL GENERALIZED, TYPE 2
BSCL2, 5-BP DEL, NT659

Magre et al. (2001) found that all Lebanese patients with
Berardinelli-Seip congenital lipodystrophy (269700) whom they studied
were homozygous for a frameshift mutation resulting from the deletion of
GTATC at nucleotide 659 of the BSCL2 gene.

In fibroblasts from a BSCL2 patient with the 5-bp deletion, Szymanski et
al. (2007) found abnormal cytoplasmic lipid droplets.

.0006
LIPODYSTROPHY, CONGENITAL GENERALIZED, TYPE 2
BSCL2, 1-BP INS, 669A

In 2 South African Portuguese families with Berardinelli-Seip congenital
lipodystrophy (269700), Magre et al. (2001) found homozygosity for a
frameshift resulting from insertion of an adenine at nucleotide 669 of
the BSCL2 gene.

Bhayana et al. (2002) described the same mutation in a 10-year-old girl
from Canada whose parents were not known to be consanguineous, although
they came from the same region of Portugal. The family history was
positive for BSCL on both sides of the family. Her father had 2 affected
male cousins who were born to consanguineous parents and died in
childhood. Another affected female first cousin of the father died at 30
years of age with renal failure. An affected male, the second cousin of
the patient's mother, died at 28 years of age. In addition to having the
typical attributes of complete lipodystrophy, the patient had been
diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in the first year of life. A
relationship between congenital lipodystrophy syndromes and cardiac
disorders is suggested by the fact that mutations in lamin A/C (LMNA;
150330) cause either lipodystrophy or cardiomyopathy.

Fu et al. (2004) found this mutation in 18 patients from 15 Caucasian
families from the same region of Serido county of Rio Grande do Norte
State in northeastern Brazil.

.0007
LIPODYSTROPHY, CONGENITAL GENERALIZED, TYPE 2
BSCL2, ARG138TER

In a French Portuguese family and 2 additional Portuguese families with
Berardinelli-Seip congenital lipodystrophy (269700), Magre et al. (2001)
identified homozygosity for an arg138-to-stop mutation that resulted
from a C-to-T transition at nucleotide 756 of the BSCL2 gene.

.0008
LIPODYSTROPHY, CONGENITAL GENERALIZED, TYPE 2
BSCL2, IVS4, G-A, +1

In a consanguineous Turkish family segregating Berardinelli-Seip
congenital lipodystrophy (269700), Magre et al. (2001) identified a
G-to-A transition at the +1 position of intron 4, resulting in skipping
of exon 4.

.0009
LIPODYSTROPHY, CONGENITAL GENERALIZED, TYPE 2
BSCL2, ALA212PRO

In 4 southwestern Norwegian families segregating Berardinelli-Seip
congenital lipodystrophy (269700), Magre et al. (2001) identified a
G-to-C transversion at nucleotide 978 of the BSCL2 gene, resulting in an
alanine-to-proline substitution at codon 212. This mutation was found in
homozygosity in 3 of the families and in compound heterozygosity in 1.
The condition manifested at birth in these families.

LIPODYSTROPHY, CONGENITAL GENERALIZED, TYPE 2
BSCL2, 1-BP DEL, 980C

In a consanguineous Indian family segregating Berardinelli-Seip
congenital lipodystrophy (269700), Magre et al. (2001) identified
homozygosity for a mutation in the BSCL2 gene, the deletion of a C at
nucleotide 980 resulting in a frameshift at codon 213 and premature
termination at codon 232.

.0011
LIPODYSTROPHY, CONGENITAL GENERALIZED, TYPE 2
BSCL2, IVS6, G-A, +5

In a British family segregating Berardinelli-Seip congenital
lipodystrophy (269700), Magre et al. (2001) identified a G-to-A
transition at the +5 position of intron 6 of the BSCL2 gene, which
resulted in activation of a cryptic splice site leading to premature
termination at codon 225. The patient was compound heterozygous for this
mutation, and the condition manifested at birth.

.0012
LIPODYSTROPHY, CONGENITAL GENERALIZED, TYPE 2
BSCL2, IVS6, C-G, -3

In a Turkish French family segregating Berardinelli-Seip congenital
lipodystrophy (269700), Magre et al. (2001) identified homozygosity for
a C-to-G transversion at the -3 position of intron 6. This mutation
resulted in skipping of exon 7.

.0013
SILVER SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA SYNDROME
SPINAL MUSCULAR ATROPHY, DISTAL, TYPE VA, INCLUDED
BSCL2, ASN88SER

In affected members of 1 English and 4 Austrian families with Silver
spastic paraplegia syndrome (SPG27; 270685), Windpassinger et al. (2004)
identified heterozygosity for a 263A-G transition in the BSCL2 gene,
resulting in an asn88-to-ser (N88S) mutation. The English family was the
original one reported by Silver (1966). In affected members of 1
Italian, 1 English, and 8 Austrian families with distal spinal muscular
atrophy (HMN5A; 600794), they identified the N88S mutation.

Auer-Grumbach et al. (2005) reported the phenotypic findings in 90
patients from 1 large Austrian family and 2 unrelated German families
with the N88S mutation. There was considerable phenotypic variability,
including asymptomatic nonpenetrance (4.4%), subclinical involvement
(20%), distal spinal muscular atrophy characterized by prominent hand
muscle involvement (31.1%), Silver syndrome (14.5%) with hand muscle
involvement and spasticity, a Charcot-Marie-Tooth-like phenotype with
distal muscle weakness and wasting of the lower limbs and sensory
abnormalities (20%), and spastic paraparesis without hand involvement
(10%). Auer-Grumbach et al. (2005) concluded that the N88S mutation
causes a motor neuron disease affecting the upper motor neurons, lower
motor neurons, or both. Hand muscle involvement was a frequent, although
not regular, feature, and sensory involvement was usually not present.
Genealogic studies of the Austrian kindred traced the disease to a
common parent pair born in 1682.

Van de Warrenburg et al. (2006) reported 2 Dutch families with multiple
affected individuals carrying a heterozygous N88S mutation. The
phenotype in both families overlapped between Silver syndrome and HMN5.
Affected members in both families had foot and lower limb atrophy with
slowly progressive hyperreflexia and extensor plantar responses without
prominent spasticity. Hand involvement occurred in most patients and was
restricted to interosseus muscles.

Brusse et al. (2009) reported 12 members of a large 3-generation Dutch
family with phenotypic overlap between Silver syndrome and distal HMN5
who carried a heterozygous N88S mutation. The phenotype was variable,
and the distribution of muscle weakness and atrophy included
predominantly the feet (in 4), the hands (in 1), or both upper and lower
extremities (in 4). Three individuals showed evidence of pyramidal
features, including spasticity, hyperrflexia, and extensor plantar
responses. Severity of the disease ranged from adolescent patients with
disabling muscle weakness to an elderly patient with only mild weakness
of the ankle dorsiflexors and bilateral pes cavus. Brusse et al. (2009)
noted the extreme phenotypic variability associated with the N88S
mutation in their family and in those reported by Auer-Grumbach et al.
(2005) and van de Warrenburg et al. (2006), and suggested the presence
of other genetic or environmental factors. In their family, Brusse et
al. (2009) used genomewide linkage analysis to identify a candidate
disease modifier on chromosome 16p13.3-p13.12 between SNPs dbSNP
rs6500882 and dbSNP rs7192086 that was shared by all 12 affected
individuals (maximum lod score of 3.28). One family member without the
N88S mutation but with the chromosome 16p haplotype showed mild
electrophysiologic abnormalities. Brusse et al. (2009) postulated that a
locus on chromosome 16p may contain a disease modifier in their family.

Chaudhry et al. (2013) identified a heterozygous N88S mutation in a man
with SPG17. He had onset of weakness of the hands and feet at around 12
years of age. Examination at age 14 showed distal weakness and wasting
with clawed hands and flat feet, extensor plantar responses, mild
tremor, and distal sensory impairment. The disorder was slowly
progressive, and he remained ambulatory with orthotics at age 36. His
affected uncle also carried the mutation, as did his unaffected mother,
suggesting incomplete penetrance. The mutation was identified by exome
sequencing of the proband. The family was originally reported by
Ionasescu et al. (1991) as having an X-linked form of CMT (302802).

SILVER SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA SYNDROME
BSCL2, SER90LEU

In affected members of a Belgian family and a Brazilian family with
Silver spastic paraplegia syndrome (SPG17; 270685), Windpassinger et al.
(2004) identified heterozygosity for a 269C-T transition in the BSCL2
gene, resulting in a ser90-to-leu (S90L) mutation.

.0015
LIPODYSTROPHY, CONGENITAL GENERALIZED, TYPE 2
BSCL2, ARG275TER

In 3 Japanese patients with Berardinelli-Seip congenital generalized
lipodystrophy (269700) from independent families, Ebihara et al. (2004)
identified a homozygous C-to-T transition in exon 8 of the BSCL2 gene
that resulted in premature termination of seipin at codon 275 (R275X).
Analysis of microsatellite markers and SNPs demonstrated common
ancestry. The authors stated that their study was the first report on
gene and phenotype analysis of congenital generalized lipodystrophy in
Japanese.

.0016
LIPODYSTROPHY, CONGENITAL GENERALIZED, TYPE 2
BSCL2, GLU189TER

In a Chinese infant with Berardinelli-Seip congenital generalized
lipodystrophy (269700), Friguls et al. (2009) identified a homozygous
565G-T transversion in exon 5 of the BSCL2 gene, resulting in a
glu189-to-ter (E189X) substitution. In addition to classic features of
the disorder, the patient had hypertension, an apical murmur, and severe
obstructive and asymmetric septal hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The
authors emphasized the early onset of severe cardiac disease in this
patient.

Jin et al. (2007) had identified the E189X mutation in another Chinese
boy with congenital generalized lipodystrophy with early-onset diabetes
mellitus.

606062	TITLE *606062 STRUCTURAL MAINTENANCE OF CHROMOSOMES 3; SMC3
;;CHONDROITIN SULFATE PROTEOGLYCAN 6; CSPG6;;
BAMACAN; BAM;;
HUMAN CHROMOSOME-ASSOCIATED POLYPEPTIDE; HCAP
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Proteoglycans are specialized glycoproteins with heterogeneous
structures that are found in all connective tissues and on cell
surfaces. SMC3, or bamacan (BAM), which was originally isolated from
embryonic parietal yolk sac, is an abundant secreted chondroitin sulfate
proteoglycan in basement membranes and an intracellular protein. See
SCC1 (606462) and Sumara et al. (2000) for information on the role of
SMC3 in cohesin association with and dissociation from chromosomes.

CLONING

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a B-cell cDNA library with SMAP
(601836) as bait, followed by probing a brain cDNA library, Shimizu et
al. (1998) obtained a cDNA encoding SMC3, which they termed HCAP.
Sequence analysis predicted that the 1,217-amino acid HCAP protein is
98% identical to rat Cspg6 and is homologous to frog and fly Cap
proteins. HCAP has a head-rod-tail organization, which is common in SMC
family members. The head contains an NTP-binding motif and the tail has
a DA box. Western blot analysis showed expression of an approximately
140-kD nuclear protein. GST-pull down analysis confirmed the specific
interaction between SMAP and HCAP. Fluorescence microscopy demonstrated
an association of HCAP with mitotic chromosomes. Coimmunoprecipitation
analysis indicated that HCAP is associated with SMAP and KIF3A
(604683)/KIF3B (603754) in the nucleus.

Using Northern blot analysis, Ghiselli et al. (1999) detected ubiquitous
expression of a 4.2-kb Bam transcript in mouse, with highest levels in
testis and brain, lower levels in muscle, heart, lung, kidney, colon,
and thymus, and much lower levels in spleen, kidney, and liver. Ghiselli
and Iozzo (2000) detected high levels of BAM expression in spontaneously
transformed human and mouse colon carcinoma cells. They proposed that
deregulated BAM/SMC3 expression may be directly linked to oncogenesis.

GENE FUNCTION

In yeast, the cohesin complex is essential for sister chromatid cohesion
during mitosis. The Smc1 (300040) and Smc3 subunits are rod-shaped
molecules with globular ABC-like ATPases at one end and dimerization
domains at the other, connected by long coiled coils. Smc1 and Smc3
associate to form V-shaped heterodimers. Their ATPase heads are thought
to be bridged by a third subunit, Scc1, creating a huge triangular ring
that can trap sister DNA molecules. Gruber et al. (2003) studied whether
cohesin forms such rings in vivo. Proteolytic cleavage of Scc1 by
separase at the onset of anaphase triggers its dissociation from
chromosomes. The authors showed that N- and C-terminal Scc1 cleavage
fragments remain connected due to their association with different heads
of a single Smc1/Smc3 heterodimer. Cleavage of the Smc3 coiled-coil was
sufficient to trigger cohesin release from chromosomes and loss of
sister cohesion, consistent with a topologic association with chromatin.

Cohesin's Scc1 (606462), Smc1, and Smc3 subunits form a tripartite ring
structure, and it had been proposed that cohesin holds sister DNA
molecules together by trapping them inside its ring. To test this,
Haering et al. (2008) used site-specific crosslinking to create chemical
connections at the 3 interfaces between the 3 constituent polypeptides
of the ring, thereby creating covalently closed cohesin rings. As
predicted by the ring entrapment model, this procedure produced dimeric
DNA-cohesin structures that are resistant to protein denaturation.
Haering et al. (2008) concluded that cohesin rings concatenate
individual sister minichromosome DNA molecules.

Rolef Ben-Shahar et al. (2008) identified spontaneous suppressors of the
thermosensitive eco1-1 allele (see 609674) in budding yeast. An
acetylation-mimicking mutation of a conserved lysine in cohesin's Smc3
subunit makes Eco1 dispensable for cell growth, and Rolef Ben-Shahar et
al. (2008) showed that Smc3 is acetylated in an Eco1-dependent manner
during DNA replication to promote sister chromatid cohesion. A second
set of eco1-1 suppressors inactivate the budding yeast ortholog of the
cohesin destabilizer Wapl (610754). Rolef Ben-Shahar et al. (2008)
concluded that Eco1 modifies cohesin to stabilize sister chromatid
cohesion in parallel with a cohesion establishment reaction that is in
principle Eco1-independent.

Unal et al. (2008) found that in budding yeast, the head domain of the
Smc3 protein subunit of cohesin is acetylated by the Eco1p protein
acetyltransferase at 2 evolutionarily conserved residues, promoting the
chromatin-bound cohesin to tether sister chromatids. Smc3 protein
acetylation is induced in S phase after the chromatin loading of cohesin
and is suppressed in G1 and G2/M.

Zhang et al. (2008) showed that acetylation of SMC3 by ESCO1 was
required for S phase sister chromatid cohesion in human cells and in
yeast. In HeLa cells, ESCO1 acetylated SMC3 on lys105 and lys106, and
knockdown of ESCO1 expression via small interfering RNA significantly
decreased SMC3 acetylation. Expression of a dominant-negative
nonacetylatable SMC3 mutant in HEK293T cells permitted SMC3
incorporation into the cohesin complex, but it interfered with sister
chromatid cohesion and resulted in scattered chromosomes and chromosome
breakage. Zhang et al. (2008) concluded that ESCO1 is the major
acetyltransferase required for SMC3 acetylation, and that SMC3
acetylation is required for sister chromatid cohesion and maintenance of
genomic stability.

Through single-molecule analysis, Terret et al. (2009) demonstrated that
a replication complex, the RFC-CTF18 clamp loader (see 613201), controls
the velocity spacing and restart activity of replication forks in human
cells and is required for robust acetylation of cohesin's SMC3 subunit
and sister chromatid cohesion. Unexpectedly, Terret et al. (2009)
discovered that cohesin acetylation itself is a central determinant of
fork processivity, as slow-moving replication forks were found in cells
lacking the Eco1-related acetyltransferases ESCO1 or ESCO2 (609353)
(including those derived from Roberts syndrome (268300) patients, in
whom ESCO2 is biallelically mutated), and in cells expressing a form of
SMC3 that cannot be acetylated. This defect was a consequence of
cohesin's hyperstable interaction with 2 regulatory cofactors, WAPL and
PDS5A (613200); removal of either cofactor allowed forks to progress
rapidly without ESCO1, ESCO2, or RFC-CTF18. Terret et al. (2009)
concluded that their results showed a novel mechanism for clamp
loader-dependent fork progression, mediated by the posttranslational
modification and structural remodeling of the cohesin ring. Loss of this
regulatory mechanism leads to the spontaneous accrual of DNA damage and
may contribute to the abnormalities of the Roberts syndrome
cohesinopathy.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Ghiselli et al. (1999) determined that the
mouse Smc3 gene contains 31 exons and is driven by a promoter enriched
in GC sequences and lacking TATA and CAAT boxes.

MAPPING

Ghiselli et al. (1999) mapped the mouse Smc3 gene to chromosome 19, in a
region showing homology of synteny to human 10q25. The International
Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the SMC3 gene to chromosome
10 (TMAP SHGC-16010).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CDLS; see 122470) is a multisystem
developmental disorder including craniofacial dysmorphia, hirsutism,
malformations of the upper limbs, and neurodevelopmental delay. Because
mutations in the cohesin complex member NIPBL (608667) result in CDLS,
Deardorff et al. (2007) screened 115 NIPBL mutation-negative individuals
with sporadic or familial CDLS and probands with CDLS-variant phenotypes
for mutations in the cohesin complex component genes SMC3 and SMC1A
(300040). They found 1 mutation in SMC3 (606062.0001) in a patient with
a milder CDLS phenotype (CDLS3; 610759). Structural analysis of the
mutant SMC3 protein indicated that it was likely to produce a functional
cohesin complex, but Deardorff et al. (2007) posited that the mutation
may alter the chromosome binding dynamics of the protein. Additionally,
the authors found 14 additional mutations in the SMC1A gene in patients
with X-linked CDLS (CDLS2; 300590). The data indicated that SMC3 and
SMC1A mutations contribute to approximately 5% of cases of CDLS,
resulting in a consistently mild phenotype with absence of major
structural anomalies typically associated with CDLS, and in some
instances, resulted in a phenotype that approached that of apparently
nonsyndromic mental retardation.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CORNELIA DE LANGE SYNDROME 3
SMC3, 3-BP DEL, 1464AGA

In a male with a mild variant form of Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CDLS3;
610759), Deardorff et al. (2007) found a 3-bp deletion in the SMC3 gene
(1464_1466delAGA), resulting in deletion of glu488 (E488del). The
mutation occurred in the junction of the N-terminal coiled-coil and the
hinge domain, a region conserved from bacteria to human. Neither parent
carried the mutation, indicating that it was a de novo event.

Revenkova et al. (2009) showed that E488del-mutant SMC3 affected the
affinity of SMC hinge dimers for DNA. Mutated hinge dimers bound DNA
with higher affinity than wildtype proteins, and SMC3-mutated Cornelia
de Lange syndrome cell lines displayed genomic instability and
sensitivity to ionizing radiation and interstrand crosslinking agents.

;;TESTIS SPERMATOGENESIS APOPTOSIS-RELATED PROTEIN 6; TSARG6
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

DNAJA13 belongs to the evolutionarily conserved DNAJ/HSP40 family of
proteins. For background information on the DNAJ family, see 608375.

CLONING

Using database analysis followed by nested PCR on a human testis cDNA
library, Liu et al. (2004) identified DNAJA13, which they called testis
spermatogenesis apoptosis-related protein-6. DNAJA13 encodes a deduced
316-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 36 kD. DNAJB13
contains an N-terminal J domain and shares 89% sequence identity with
the mouse Dnajb13 protein. RT-PCR showed that DNAJB13 is expressed
strongly in fetal testis and epididymis and adult testis, and weakly in
fetal kidney, liver, spleen, heart, and lung. Northern blot analysis
confirmed specific expression of a 1.8-kb DNAJB13 transcript in adult
testis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Liu et al. (2004) demonstrated that the DNAJB13 gene contains 8 exons.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Liu et al. (2004) mapped the DNAJB13 gene to
chromosome 11q13.3.

602436	TITLE *602436 MAJOR HISTOCOMPATIBILITY COMPLEX CLASS I CHAIN-RELATED GENE B; MICB
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

See MICA (600169). MICA and MICB are divergent image C-related
molecules. Their characteristics include the lack of association with
beta-2-microglobulin (B2M; 109700), stable expression without
conventional class I peptide ligands, and the absence of a CD8 binding
site. The 5-prime-end flanking regions of the genes for MICA and MICB
include putative heat-shock elements similar to those of heat-shock
protein-70 genes (see 140550), and the encoded mRNAs are increased in
heat-shock-stressed epithelial cells (Groh et al., 1996).

GENE FUNCTION

T cells expressing gamma/delta T-cell receptors (see 186970) recognize
antigens without restriction by polymorphic MHC class I or class II
molecules and their associated peptide ligands. T cells with variable
region V-delta-1 gamma/delta receptors represent 70 to 90% of the
gamma/delta T cells in the intestinal epithelium and may function as
sentinels that respond to self antigens. Groh et al. (1998) demonstrated
that MICA and MICB were recognized by this subset of T cells. These
interactions involved the alpha-1/alpha-2 domains of MICA and MICB but
were independent of antigen processing. Groh et al. (1998) stated that,
with intestinal epithelial cell lines, expression and recognition of
MICA and MICB could be stress induced; thus, these molecules may broadly
regulate protective responses by the V-delta-1 gamma/delta T cells in
the epithelium of the intestinal tract.

The MICA/MICB locus is not conserved in mice; however, mice do have
counterpart NKG2D (602893) ligands, Rae1-beta and H60. Diefenbach et al.
(2001) demonstrated that ectopic expression of these ligands in tumor
cell lines resulted not only in potent rejection mediated by either
natural killer (NK) cells or CD8-positive T cells, but that mice
subsequently challenged with tumor cell lines not expressing the ligands
were also immune to the tumors. Girardi et al. (2001) determined that
immunity to cutaneous malignancies could be mediated by NKG2D-expressing
intraepithelial gamma/delta T cells. Girardi et al. (2001) proposed that
the diverse expression of NKG2D on cytolytic cell types may allow
attacks on tumor cells in different anatomical compartments and that
gamma/delta T cells may be particularly important in skin and gut.

NK cells and their targets interact through receptors and ligands found
in ordered structures, termed immune synapses. Using immunofluorescence
and confocal microscopy, Roda-Navarro et al. (2006) found that
incubation of a B-cell line stably expressing MICB with NK cells led to
bidirectional transfer of NKG2D and MICB at the synapse between the
effector and target cells. Subsequently, the NK cells showed reduced
cytotoxic capacity when they encountered MICB-expressing target cells.

Stern-Ginossar et al. (2007) developed an algorithm for the prediction
of miRNA targets and applied it to human cytomegalovirus miRNAs,
resulting in the identification of the MICB gene as a top candidate
target of human cytomegalovirus-miR-UL112. MICB is a stress-induced
ligand of the NK cell-activating receptor NKG2D and is critical for the
NK cell killing of virus-infected cells and tumor cells. Stern-Ginossar
et al. (2007) showed that human cytomegalovirus-miR-UL112 specifically
downregulates MICB expression during viral infection, leading to
decreased binding of NKG2D and reduced killing by NK cells. The authors
concluded that their results revealed a miRNA-based immunoevasion
mechanism that appears to be exploited by human cytomegalovirus.

MAPPING

Nalabolu et al. (1996) showed that the MICA and MICB genes occur in a
200-kb region spanning the TNFA (191160) and TNFB (153440) cluster at
6p21.3.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Fischer et al. (2000) described 3 novel MICB alleles, confirming
previous findings that most of the polymorphisms in the MICB gene, as in
MICA, are coding, and suggested that the extent of polymorphism in the 2
genes may be comparable.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Entry of the poliovirus into permissive cells is dependent on the
expression of a specific receptor, the poliovirus receptor (PVR;
173850), which is an integral membrane glycoprotein. Its extracellular
region exhibits 3 immunoglobulin-like domains. Two integral forms,
PVR-alpha and PVR-delta, and 2 soluble forms, PVR-beta and PVR-gamma,
are lacking a transmembrane region generated by alternative splicing of
mRNA. The normal cellular function of PVR is unknown. The identification
of human PVR prompted study of its counterpart in other species. In the
monkey, 2 genes located at 2 separate genetic loci, AGM1 and AGM2, have
been cloned. AGM1 encodes 2 membrane-bound splice variant forms
homologous to PVR-alpha and PVR-delta. AGM2 encodes a membrane-bound
form, PVR-alpha-2. Morrison and Racaniello (1992) described a murine
gene, Mph, as a structural homolog of human PVR. Two Mph molecules,
Mph-alpha and Mph-beta, are thought to be generated by alternative
splicing from a primary transcript.

Following the discovery of the human PVR-related gene (PVRR1; 600644),
other PVR-related molecules were sought. Using degenerate
oligonucleotides in a PCR-based methodology, Eberle et al. (1995)
identified a second PVR-related cDNA, which they called PRR2.
Furthermore, they presented evidence that PRR2, and not PVR, is the
homolog of Mph, and questioned the existence of a true murine homolog of
PVR. The PRR2 gene encodes 2 glycoproteins, PRR2-alpha (short form) and
PRR2-delta (long form), which have 69% and 73% identity within Mph-alpha
and Mph-beta, respectively. In contrast, the human PVR protein exhibits
only 51% identity which is, moreover, restricted to the 3 immunoglobulin
domains of the murine protein. Northern blot analysis showed that 2 mRNA
isoforms of 3.0 kb (PRR2-alpha) and 4.4 kb (PRR2-delta) are ubiquitously
found in various normal human tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

Bottino et al. (2003) immunized mice with natural killer
(NK)-susceptible human target cells and obtained antibodies to PVR and
PVRL2. Binding analysis and flow cytometry demonstrated that both
molecules bound strongly with DNAM1 (CD226; 605397), but not with other
activating NK receptors, including NKp46 (NCR1; 604530) and NKp30 (NCR3;
611550). Expression of PVR or PVRL2 rendered cells susceptible to
enhanced lysis in a DNAM1-dependent manner that was nearly abrogated in
the presence of antibody to PVR, PVRL2, or DNAM1.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Liu et al. (2012) generated the crystal structure of the nectin-2
Ig-like V-set domain at 1.85-angstrom resolution. The structure bound to
both the soluble ectodomain of DNAM1 and cell surface-expressed
full-length DNAM1. Mutational analysis revealed that disruption of the
homodimeric interface of nectin-2 led to failure of homodimer formation
and loss of binding to DNAM1.

MAPPING

By isotopic hybridization, Eberle et al. (1995) mapped the PRR2 gene to
19q13.2-q13.4 in the same chromosomal region as PVR. By genomic sequence
analysis, Freitas et al. (1998) mapped the PRR2 gene to chromosome
19q13.2, where it lies centromeric to the TOMM40 gene (608061) and the
APOE (107741)-APOC2 (608083) gene cluster.

;;PEROXIN 16
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Honsho et al. (1998) isolated a human PEX16 cDNA by performing an
expressed sequence tag (EST) homology search on a human DNA database and
by using yeast PEX16 from Yarrowia lipolytica to screen a human liver
cDNA library. This cDNA was found to encode a peroxisomal protein,
peroxin 16, that contains 336 amino acids. Among 13
peroxisome-deficiency complementation groups, PEX16 expression
morphologically and biochemically restored peroxisome biogenesis only in
fibroblasts from a case of Zellweger syndrome of the complementation
group referred to as CGD in Japan and CG9 in the United States. PEX16
was localized to peroxisomes through expression study of epitope-labeled
PEX16 protein.

South and Gould (1999) characterized wildtype PEX16 and found that it
has an apparent molecular mass of about 38 kD by SDS/PAGE. Sequence
analysis revealed 2 transmembrane domains, 1 spanning amino acids
110-144 and another spanning amino acids 222-243. Protease protection
experiments revealed a membrane orientation where the N- and C-termini
extend into the cytoplasm and the intermembrane loop is protected within
the peroxisome lumen.

GENE FUNCTION

South and Gould (1999) found that fibroblasts from the patient carrying
the R176X mutation (603360.0001) were unable to import PMP70 (170995)
into peroxisomes. Transfection and overexpression of wildtype PEX16 did
not induce peroxisome proliferation, but restored PMP70 import. The
authors concluded that PEX16-mediated formation of peroxisomes does not
require the division of preexisting peroxisomes. By characterizing
various truncation mutants, Honsho et al. (2002) determined that a
positively charged region (amino acids 66-81) and the first
transmembrane domain are required for peroxisome targeting of PEX16. The
C-terminal cytoplasmically exposed region of PEX16 functioned in
peroxisome formation. Transfection and overexpression of the R176X
mutation interfered with membrane protein transport.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In the study by Honsho et al. (1998), one patient with a peroxisomal
biogenesis disorder was found to have a homozygous nonsense mutation
(603360.0001) in the PEX16 gene.

In 6 patients, including 2 sibs, with a relatively mild form of
Zellweger syndrome characterized by early-childhood onset of progressive
spastic paraparesis and ataxia with progressive leukodystrophy and brain
atrophy on brain MRI, Ebberink et al. (2010) identified 5 different
homozygous mutations in the PEX16 gene (see, e.g.,
603360.0003-603360.0005). Studies of skin fibroblasts showed that
peroxisomes were markedly enlarged in size and reduced in number
compared to controls. However, biochemical studies showed only mild
abnormalities, such as increased very-long-chain fatty acids, and
increased bile acid intermediates or increased branched chain fatty
acids in some. Phytanic acid alpha-oxidation, pristanic acid
beta-oxidation, and red cell plasmalogen were normal. Peroxisomal
enzymes were normal, and the peroxisomes were import-competent.
Expression of wildtype PEX16 restored the number and size of peroxisomes
in patient fibroblasts to normal. Expression of mutant PEX16 in
PEX16-null cells resulted in enlarged peroxisomes in about 30% of cells,
indicating some residual activity. Ebberink et al. (2010) emphasized
that even though PEX16 is involved in peroxisomal membrane assembly,
PEX16 defects can present with a relatively mild phenotype showing
import-competent peroxisomes in fibroblasts.

PEROXISOME BIOGENESIS DISORDER 8A (ZELLWEGER)
PEX16, ARG176TER

In fibroblasts from a patient with Zellweger syndrome of complementation
group D (PBD8A; 614876), purchased from the NIGMS Human Genetic Mutant
Cell Repository (CCR GM06231), Honsho et al. (1998) demonstrated
deficiency of peroxin-16 and a nonsense mutation in the PEX16 gene: a
C-to-T transition at nucleotide 526, resulting in a change of codon 176
from CGA (arg) to TGA (stop).

.0002
PEROXISOME BIOGENESIS DISORDER 8A (ZELLWEGER)
PEX16, IVSDS10, T-C, +2

Shimozawa et al. (2002) identified a homozygous splice site mutation
(IVS10+2T-C) in 2 complementation group D patients (PBD8A; 614876),
causing exon 10 deletion and changing the amino acid sequence starting
from codon 298, introducing a termination codon at position 336.

PEROXISOME BIOGENESIS DISORDER 8B
PEX16, 1-BP DEL, 984G

In 2 sibs, born of consanguineous Turkish parents, with a peroxisomal
biogenesis disorder (PBD8B; 614877), Ebberink et al. (2010) identified a
homozygous 1-bp deletion (984delG) in exon 11a of the PEX16 gene,
resulting in a frameshift and premature protein truncation. Exon 11b was
unaffected. Both patients presented between age 1 and 2 years with
delayed walking and frequent falls after normal initial development. The
disorder was progressive, characterized by lower limb spasticity and
ataxia resulting in wheelchair-dependence in the first decade. Studies
of skin fibroblasts showed that peroxisomes were markedly enlarged in
size and reduced in number compared to controls. However, biochemical
studies showed only mild abnormalities, such as increased
very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA), increased bile acid intermediates,
and increased branched chain fatty acids (only found in 1 sib).
Expression of wildtype PEX16 restored the number and size of peroxisomes
in patient fibroblasts to normal. Ebberink et al. (2010) emphasized that
even though PEX16 is involved in peroxisomal membrane assembly, PEX16
defects can present with a relatively mild phenotype showing
import-competent peroxisomes in fibroblasts.

PEROXISOME BIOGENESIS DISORDER 8B
PEX16, TYR331CYS

In a girl with a relatively mild type of peroxisomal biogenesis disorder
(PBD8B; 614877), Ebberink et al. (2010) identified a homozygous 992A-G
transition in exon 11a of the PEX16 gene, resulting in a tyr331-to-cys
(Y331C) substitution. She developed an ataxic gait at age 2 years, after
normal initial development except for delayed walking. At age 6 years,
she had mild cognitive impairment, moderate dysarthria, and abnormal eye
saccades. Brain MRI showed widespread white matter changes on a
background pattern of global delay in myelin maturation, and reduced
cerebellar volume. Similar MRI findings were observed in her younger
sister. Studies of skin fibroblasts showed that peroxisomes were
markedly enlarged in size and reduced in number compared to controls.
However, biochemical studies showed only mild abnormalities, such as
increased VLCFA, but most other peroxisomal functions appeared normal.

PEROXISOME BIOGENESIS DISORDER 8B
PEX16, DEL, EX11

In an Indian girl, born of consanguineous parents, with a relatively
mild type of peroxisomal biogenesis disorder (PBD8B; 614877), Ebberink
et al. (2010) identified a homozygous large intragenic deletion of
intron 10 and exon 11 of the PEX16 gene. In transcript variant 1, the
deletion affected the last 468 base pairs of intron 10, the entire exon
11a, and the first 80 base pairs of the 3-prime flanking region of exon
11a. In transcript variant 2, the deletion affected the last 603 base
pairs of intron 10, and the first 4 base pairs of exon 11b. The deletion
resulted in 3 alternative splice products. She showed normal development
for the first year of life, but then stopped acquiring new skills, and
lost her ability to walk independently at age 24 months due to
spasticity and mild ataxia. Her speech and other cognitive functions
also deteriorated slowly over time. At the age of 5 years, she had
nystagmus, cataracts, hyperreflexia, clonus, and extensor plantar
responses. Brain imaging showed diffuse white matter abnormalities and
focal atrophy of the cerebellum and corpus callosum. Peripheral nerve
velocity studies of the lower limbs suggested demyelination. Studies of
skin fibroblasts showed that the peroxisomes were markedly enlarged in
size and reduced in number compared to controls. However, biochemical
studies showed only mild abnormalities, such as increased VLCFA, but
most other peroxisomal functions appeared normal.

180960	TITLE *180960 S-ADENOSYLHOMOCYSTEINE HYDROLASE; AHCY
;;SAHH
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The AHCY gene encodes S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (EC 3.3.1.1),
which catalyzes the hydrolysis of S-adenosylhomocysteine to adenosine
and homocysteine (summary by Baric et al., 2004).

CLONING

Coulter-Karis and Hershfield (1989) isolated cDNA clones for human AHCY
from a placental cDNA library. The deduced 432-amino acid protein has a
molecular mass of 47.6 kD with 97% identity to the rat protein.

GENE FUNCTION

Baric et al. (2004) noted that S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase
catalyzes the hydrolysis of S-adenosylhomocysteine to adenosine and
homocysteine. In eukaryotes, this is the major route for disposal of the
S-adenosylhomocysteine formed as a common product of each of many
S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferases. The reaction is
reversible, but under normal conditions the removal of both adenosine
and homocysteine is sufficiently rapid to maintain the flux in the
direction of hydrolysis. Physiologically, S-adenosylhomocysteine
hydrolysis serves not only to sustain the flux of methionine sulfur
toward cysteine, but is believed also to play a critical role in the
regulation of biologic methylations.

EVOLUTION

Hershfield and Francke (1982) noted that in ADA deficiency (see 102700),
adenosine and deoxyadenosine accumulate and, respectively, inhibit and
inactivate S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase. The fact that both SAHH and
ADA are on chromosome 20 suggests an evolutionary relationship. SAHH,
which is a eukaryotic enzyme, probably arose after ADA, which occurs
also in prokaryotes. Evolution of SAHH may have required the
simultaneous occurrence of ADA to avoid the adverse effects of adenosine
and deoxyadenosine. Alternatively, tandem reduplication of a portion of
the ADA gene encoding a binding domain for adenosine may have occurred
and further changes may have led to the SAHH gene. SAHH is a major high
affinity cytoplasmic adenosine-binding protein.

MAPPING

By analysis of human-Chinese hamster hybrids, Hershfield and Francke
(1982) assigned the AHCY gene to chromosome 20.

By study of rearranged human chromosomes in human-rodent cell hybrids,
Mohandas et al. (1984) assigned the SAHH locus to 20cen-q13.1 and the
ADA gene (608958) to 20q13.1-qter. Eiberg and Mohr (1985) looked at
linkage of ADA and SAHH in their Danish family data; 8 families were
informative for polymorphism of these enzymes. The data gave a maximum
lod score of 1.59 at theta = 0.15 for males and females combined. In an
informative South African family, Bissbort et al. (1987) found a
recombination fraction of about 0.18 between SAHH and ADA. Combined with
the published findings in Danish families, the recombination fraction
for the pooled data was calculated to be 0.4 in men, 0.08 in women, and
0.13 in the sexes taken together.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Bissbort et al. (1983) found that the SAHH gene is polymorphic in
southwest Germany with 2 common alleles: SAHH*1 and SAHH*2, with
frequencies of 0.96 and 0.04, respectively. In the Japanese population,
Akiyama et al. (1984) estimated the gene frequencies of SAHH*1 and
SAHH*2 to be 0.953 and 0.047, respectively, similar to the results
reported by Bissbort et al. (1983).

Data on gene frequencies of allelic variants were tabulated by
Roychoudhury and Nei (1988).

By starch gel electrophoresis, Arredondo-Vega et al. (1989) identified 2
variant alleles in erythrocyte AHCY. In a British population, the gene
frequencies were 0.024 for AHCY*2 and 0.006 for AHCY*3. Variant isozyme
patterns could not be distinguished by isoelectric focusing.

Among 237 red blood cell samples from unrelated individuals in Croatia,
Kloor et al. (2006) identified 4 different electromorphic SAHH variants.
SAHH*4 was a new variant, present at a frequency of 0.015. Gene
frequencies for SAHH*1, SAHH*2, and SAHH*3 were 0.941, 0.032, and 0.006,
respectively. The authors identified a 'silent' allele with
significantly decreased enzyme activity, which they designated SAHH*0.
The frequency of SAHH*0 was 0.006, yielding an expected incidence for
homozygous individuals with SAHH deficiency of 1 in 30,000 in this
population.

- Hypermethioninemia with S-Adenosylhomocysteine Hydrolase
Deficiency

In a Croatian boy with S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase deficiency,
Baric et al. (2004) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations
in the AHCY gene (180960.0001 and 180960.0002). In discussing the basis
of the pathologic effects of S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase
deficiency, Baric et al. (2004) pointed to the numerous
S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferases, which are inhibited
to a greater or lesser extent by S-adenosylhomocysteine. They pointed
out that changes in DNA methylation patterns are heritable and could
negatively affect tissue-specific gene expression during embryogenesis
and after birth. Because the silencing of genes by inappropriate
methylation is the functional equivalent of somatic mutations, the
heritability of DNA methylation patterns suggests that restoration of
'normal' genomic methylation patterns may not occur.

In a Croatian boy with hypermethioninemia and S-adenosylhomocysteine
hydrolase deficiency (613752), Baric et al. (2004) identified compound
heterozygosity for mutations in exon 2 of the AHCY gene: a change of
codon codon 112 from TGG (trp) to TGA (stop) (W112X) and a change of
codon 143 from TAC (tyr) to TGC (cys) (Y143C; 180960.0002), which were
maternally and paternally derived, respectively.

611164	TITLE *611164 ARGININE-FIFTY HOMEOBOX; ARGFX
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Homeobox genes, such as ARGFX, are characterized by the presence of a
conserved DNA sequence, the homeobox, which encodes a DNA-binding
domain, the homeodomain (Booth and Holland, 2007).

CLONING

Using PRD (see 167410)-class homeodomains to query a genome database,
Booth and Holland (2007) identified ARGFX. The transcript contains 2
possible initiating ATG codons, and the longest putative protein
contains 315 amino acids. RT-PCR detected low expression of ARGFX in
human testis and undifferentiated embryonic stem cells. EST database
analysis showed ARGFX expressed in 3 human germ cell tumors. No ARGFX
orthologs were detected in the mouse genome.

GENE STRUCTURE

Booth and Holland (2007) determined that the ARGFX gene contains 5 exons
and spans about 22.7 kb. The first exon is noncoding. Exon 3 is formed
from the middle region of an Alu repetitive element.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Booth and Holland (2007) mapped the ARGFX
gene to chromosome 3q13.33. They identified 2 intronless pseudogenes, on
chromosomes 5q23.2 and 17q11.2, generated by the retrotransposition of
ARGFX mRNA.

311240	TITLE *311240 TBC1 DOMAIN FAMILY, MEMBER 25; TBC1D25
;;ORNITHINE AMINOTRANSFERASE-LIKE 1; OATL1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Based on sequence analysis, Bernards (2003) determined that the TBC1D25
gene, earlier designated OATL1, is a member of a large superfamily of
Ras GTPase activating proteins. TBC1D25 encodes a 688-amino acid protein
with a TBC domain. Bernards (2003) noted that TBC domain proteins
contain a 200- to 240-amino acid Ypt/RabGAP catalytic domain found in
the human TRE2 oncogene (604334) and the yeast Bub2p and Cdc16 spindle
checkpoint proteins.

MAPPING

Barrett et al. (1987) identified 2 gene sequences at Xp11.2 that were
similar to the ornithine aminotransferase (OAT; 613349) sequence. Using
a panel of human/rodent somatic cell hybrids segregating human
X/autosome translocations and deletions, Lafreniere et al. (1991)
refined the localization of the X-linked sequences homologous to OAT:
OATL1 mapped to Xp11.3-p11.23 (distal), while OATL2 (see 613349) mapped
to Xp11.22-p11.21 (proximal).

608749	TITLE *608749 BROMODOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 4; BRD4
;;MITOTIC CHROMOSOME-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN; MCAP; CAP;;
HUNK1
BRD4/NUT FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

BRD4 belongs to the BET family of nuclear proteins that carry 2
bromodomains and an additional ET domain. Bromodomains are implicated in
chromatin interactions (Maruyama et al., 2002).

CLONING

Dey et al. (2000) cloned mouse Brd4, which they called Mcap. The deduced
1,400-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 155 kD. It
contains 2 N-terminal bromodomains, a central ET domain, and several
kinase-like motifs in its N-terminal half. By database analysis, Dey et
al. (2000) identified a human cDNA encoding a 731-amino acid protein
with the same domain organization as the N-terminal half of mouse Brd4,
but lacking the C-terminal half. Northern blot analysis detected a
transcript of about 6.5 kb in all adult and embryonic mouse tissues
examined and in human cells. Western blot analysis of in vitro
translated mouse Brd4 and HeLa cell lysates detected BRD4 at about 200
kD, suggesting posttranslational modification. Indirect
immunofluorescent staining of HeLa cells and 2 mouse cell lines detected
BRD4 in the nucleus. During interphase, BRD4 was uniformly distributed
as fine grains in the nucleus, but it was excluded from nucleoli. In
mitotic cells, BRD4 localized almost exclusively on condensed
chromosomes.

French et al. (2001) described 2 alternatively spliced variants of BRD4
that encode proteins identical through their N-terminal halves, which
include 2 bromodomains, the ET domain, and a serine-rich region. The
longer variant has a C-terminal extension that includes a proline-rich
region and a glutamine-rich region.

By EST database analysis and PCR of a human cDNA library, You et al.
(2004) obtained a full-length cDNA encoding BRD4. The BRD4 protein
contains 1,362 amino acids.

By Northern blot analysis, French et al. (2003) determined that BRD4 is
ubiquitously expressed as 4.4- and 6.0-kb transcripts, which likely
encode the short and long BRD4 isoforms.

GENE FUNCTION

By analyzing well-spread metaphase preparations of murine myeloid
precursor cells, Dey et al. (2000) found Brd4 staining along the entire
length of chromosomes, with the exception of centromeres. Brd4
chromosome association became visible following initiation of histone H3
(see 602810) phosphorylation and early chromosomal condensation and
persisted until the end of mitosis. Differential salt extraction and
FRAP analysis indicated that Brd4 was loosely associated with chromatin
during interphase as well as mitosis. Supporting a role for BRD4 in G2/M
transition, microinjection of anti-BRD4 antibody into HeLa cell nuclei
completely inhibited entry into mitosis without abrogating ongoing DNA
replication. Dey et al. (2000) concluded that BRD4 plays a role in
chromosomal dynamics during mitosis.

Maruyama et al. (2002) found that ectopic expression of mouse Brd4 in
mouse fibroblasts and HeLa cells inhibited cell cycle progression from
G1 to S. Endogenous and transfected Brd4 interacted with replication
factor C (RFC), the conserved 5-subunit complex essential for DNA
replication, with Brd4 binding directly to the largest subunit, RFC1
(102579). In agreement with the inhibitory activity observed in vivo,
recombinant Brd4 inhibited RFC-dependent DNA elongation reactions in
vitro. Analysis of Brd4 deletion mutants indicated that both the
interaction with human RFC1 and the inhibition of entry into S phase
were dependent on the second bromodomain of Brd4. Cotransfection with
RFC1 reduced the growth-inhibitory effect of Brd4.

You et al. (2004) identified BRD4 as a major cellular interacting
partner of the bovine papillomavirus (BPV) E2 protein. They found that
BRD4 associated with mitotic chromosomes and colocalized with E2 on
mitotic chromosomes. The site of E2 binding mapped to the C-terminal
domain of BRD4. Expression of this C-terminal BRD4 domain functioned in
a dominant-negative manner to abrogate the colocalization of E2 with
BRD4 on mitotic chromosomes, to block association of the viral episomes
with BRD4, and to inhibit BPV-1 DNA-mediated cellular transformation.
BRD4 also associated with human papillomavirus-16 E2, indicating that
BRD4 binding may be a shared property of all papillomavirus E2 proteins.
You et al. (2004) concluded that the interaction of E2 with BRD4 is
required to ensure the tethering of viral genomes to the host mitotic
chromosomes for persistence of viral episomes in papillomavirus-infected
cells.

Jang et al. (2005) found that epitope-tagged mouse Brd4 interacted with
cyclin T1 (143055) and CDK9 (603251) in core positive transcription
elongation factor b (P-TEFb) complexes contained in HeLa cell nuclear
extracts. The bromodomain of Brd4 was required for the interaction. Brd4
overexpression increased P-TEFb-dependent phosphorylation of the
C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II (see POLR2A; 180660) and
stimulated transcription of a reporter plasmid driven by an HIV-1
promoter. Conversely, reduced Brd4 expression in mouse fibroblasts by
small interfering RNA reduced RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain
phosphorylation and transcription. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays
indicated that recruitment of P-TEFb to a promoter was dependent on
Brd4, and recruitment was enhanced by increased chromatin acetylation.

About half of cellular P-TEFb exists in an inactive complex with 7SK
snRNA (606515) and the HEXIM1 protein (607328). Yang et al. (2005)
demonstrated that the remaining half associated with BRD4. In
stress-induced HeLa cells, 7SK/HEXIM1-bound P-TEFb was converted into
the BRD4-associated form. The association of P-TEFb with BRD4 was
necessary to form the transcriptionally active P-TEFb, to recruit P-TEFb
to a promoter, and to enable P-TEFb to contact the Mediator complex (see
602984).

Crawford et al. (2008) showed that activation of Brd4 in mice repressed
tumor growth and metastasis and that BRD4 activation in human breast
carcinomas induced a gene expression profile predictive of breast cancer
outcome.

Zuber et al. (2011) described a nonbiased approach to probe epigenetic
vulnerabilities in acute myeloid leukemia (AML; 601626), an aggressive
hematopoietic malignancy that is often associated with aberrant
chromatin states. By screening a custom library of small hairpin RNAs
(shRNAs) targeting known chromatin regulators in a genetically defined
AML mouse model, they identified the protein BRD4 as being required for
disease maintenance. Suppression of BRD4 using shRNAs or the
small-molecule inhibitor JQ1 led to robust antileukemic effects in vitro
and in vivo, accompanied by terminal myeloid differentiation and
elimination of leukemia stem cells. Similar sensitivities were observed
in a variety of human AML cell lines and primary patient samples,
revealing that JQ1 has broad activity in diverse AML subtypes. The
effects of BRD4 suppression are, at least in part, due to its role in
sustaining MYC (190080) expression to promote aberrant self-renewal,
which implicates JQ1 as a pharmacologic means to suppress MYC in cancer.

Dawson et al. (2011) demonstrated that I-BET151, a novel small molecule
inhibitor of the BET family, of which BRD4 is a member, has profound
efficacy against human and murine MLL-fusion leukemia cell lines,
through the induction of early cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. I-BET151
treatment in 2 human leukemia cell lines with different MLL fusions
altered the expression of a common set of genes whose function may
account for these phenotypic changes. The mode of action of I-BET151 is,
at least in part, due to the inhibition of transcription at key genes
BCL2 (151430), C-MYC, and CDK6 (603368) through the displacement of
BRD3/4, PAFc, and SEC components from chromatin. In vivo studies
indicated that I-BET151 has significant therapeutic value, providing
survival benefit in 2 distinct mouse models of murine MLL-AF9 and human
MLL-AF4 leukemia.

Using a genomewide small interfering RNA screen and secondary screens,
Smith et al. (2010) identified 96 cellular genes that contributed to
viral E2 protein-mediated repression of the human papillomavirus (HPV)
long control region, which controls viral oncogene expression. In
addition to the E2-binding protein BRD4, other genes implicated included
the demethylase SMCX (KDM5C; 314690) and EP400 (606265), a component of
the NUA4/TIP60 histone acetyltransferase complex (see 601409). Smith et
al. (2010) concluded that HPV E2 uses multiple cellular proteins to
inhibit expression of its oncogenes.

Floyd et al. (2013) investigated the role of chromatin structure in the
DNA damage response by monitoring ionizing radiation-induced signaling
and response events with a high-content multiplex RNA-mediated
interference screen of chromatin-modifying and -interacting genes. Floyd
et al. (2013) found that isoform B of BRD4, in which the C-terminal
domain containing the P-TEFb-interacting region is replaced with a
divergent 75-amino acid segment, functions as an endogenous inhibitor of
DNA damage response signaling by recruiting the condensin II chromatin
remodeling complex to acetylated histones through bromodomain
interactions. Loss of this isoform resulted in relaxed chromatin
structure, rapid cell cycle checkpoint recovery, and enhanced survival
after irradiation, whereas functional gain of this isoform compacted
chromatin, attenuated DNA damage response signaling, and enhanced
radiation-induced lethality. Floyd et al. (2013) concluded that their
data implicated BRD4 as an insulator of chromatin that can modulate the
signaling response to DNA damage.

GENE STRUCTURE

French et al. (2001) reported that the coding region of the BRD4 gene
contains 19 exons.

MAPPING

By analysis of a translocation involving chromosome 19, French et al.
(2001) mapped the BRD4 gene to chromosome 19p13.1. By FISH, Dey et al.
(2000) mapped the mouse Brd4 gene to the distal region of chromosome
17B, which shows homology of synteny to human chromosome 19.

CYTOGENETICS

The balanced translocation t(15;19) has been identified in midline
carcinomas adjacent to the respiratory tract in children and young
adults and is associated with poor survival and a treatment-refractory
course. French et al. (2001) mapped the translocation breakpoints in 2
patients with t(15;19)(q13;p13.1) carcinomas. The chromosome 19
translocation breakpoints were between introns 10 and 13 in the 3-prime
end of the BRD4 coding sequence in both cancers. The breakpoints split
the coding sequence of the longer BRD4 transcript and left the short
transcript unaltered. The breakpoints in chromosome 15q13 localized to
an approximately 9-kb region containing the NOP10 gene (NOLA3; 606471)
gene. FISH screening of 13 supradiaphragmatic pediatric carcinomas
revealed a sinonasal carcinoma with a chromosome 19p13.1 and 15q13
rearrangement. The other 12 carcinomas lacked chromosome 15 or 19
rearrangements.

French et al. (2003) determined that the BRD4 fusion partner in the
t(15;19) translocation is NUT (608963). Sequence analysis indicated that
the translocations in 2 affected tumors were identical and resulted in
the in-frame fusion of exon 10 of BRD4 with exon 2 of NUT. The oncogenic
fusion protein contains the N-terminal BRD4 sequence up to the
serine-rich region, followed by almost the entire NUT sequence. It lacks
only the first 5 NUT residues. Northern blot analysis detected a 6.4-kb
fusion transcript in a t(15;19)-positive carcinoma cell line. No
NUT/BRD4 transcripts were detected.

606491	TITLE *606491 EXOSOME COMPONENT 4; EXOSC4
;;RIBOSOMAL RNA-PROCESSING PROTEIN 41, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; RRP41
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Inherently unstable mammalian mRNAs contain AU-rich elements (AREs)
within their 3-prime untranslated regions. In yeast, 3-prime-to-5-prime
mRNA degradation is mediated by the exosome, a multisubunit particle.
Chen et al. (2001) purified and characterized the human exosome by mass
spectrometry and found its composition to be similar to its yeast
counterpart. They identified the following protein subunits within the
human exosome: p7, which is homologous to the yeast Rrp4 protein
(602238); p8, which is homologous to the yeast Rrp42 protein (606488);
p9, which is homologous to the yeast Rrp43 protein (OIP2; 606019); p10,
which is homologous to the yeast Rrp40 protein (606489); p11, which is
homologous to the yeast Mtr3 protein (606490); p12A, which is homologous
to the yeast Rrp41 protein; p12B, which is homologous to the yeast Rrp46
protein (606492); and p13, which is homologous to the yeast Csl4 protein
(606493). They also identified 2 exosome-associated factors, p1 (600478)
and p14 (MPP6; 605500), that were not homologous to any yeast exosome
components.

By searching an EST database for homologs of yeast exosome components,
followed by PCR on a teratocarcinoma cell line and 5-prime RACE using
placenta RNA, Brouwer et al. (2001) isolated cDNAs encoding RRP40,
RRP41, and RRP46. The deduced 245-amino acid RRP41 protein is 96% and
approximately 40% identical to the mouse and yeast sequences,
respectively. Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence microscopy
showed expression of a 27-kD protein in the nucleus, with a larger form
expressed in the cytoplasm and the highest concentration in nucleolus.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a cell-free RNA decay system, Chen et al. (2001) demonstrated that
the mammalian exosome is required for rapid degradation of
ARE-containing RNAs but not for poly(A) shortening. They found that the
mammalian exosome does not recognize ARE-containing RNAs on its own. ARE
recognition required certain ARE-binding proteins that could interact
with the exosome and recruit it to unstable RNAs, thereby promoting
their rapid degradation.

Functional analysis by Brouwer et al. (2001) supported the conclusion
that RRP41 is present in human exosomes in a complex displaying
3-prime-to-5-prime exonuclease activity.

164342	TITLE *164342 OLFACTORY RECEPTOR, FAMILY 1, SUBFAMILY D, MEMBER 2; OR1D2
;;OLFACTORY RECEPTOR 1; OLFR1;;
TESTICULAR ODORANT RECEPTOR OR17-4; OR17-4
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The olfactory system is able to distinguish a very large number of
odorant molecules. Olfactory receptors are encoded by an extremely large
subfamily of G protein-coupled receptors. These receptors share a
7-transmembrane domain structure with many neurotransmitter and hormone
receptors. They are responsible for the recognition and G
protein-mediated transduction of odorant signals. The genes encoding
these receptors are devoid of introns within their coding regions, but
have a long intron splicing the 5-prime untranslated region (summary by
Schurmans et al., 1993).

OR1D2 is believed to function in human sperm chemotaxis and may be a
critical component of the fertilization process (Spehr et al., 2003).

CLONING

Schurmans et al. (1993) cloned a member of the olfactory receptor family
of genes, OLFR1, from a genomic library by cross-hybridization with a
gene fragment obtained by PCR.

Spehr et al. (2003) identified OR17-4, the human testicular olfactory
receptor. With the use of ratiofluorometric imaging, calcium signals
were induced by a small subset of applied chemical stimuli, establishing
the molecular receptive fields for the recombinantly expressed receptor
in HEK293 cells and the native receptor in human spermatozoa. Bourgeonal
was a powerful agonist for both recombinant and native receptor types,
as well as a strong chemoattractant in subsequent behavioral bioassays.
In contrast, undecanal was a potent olfactory receptor antagonist to
bourgeonal and related compounds. Spehr et al. (2003) concluded that
human OR17-4 functions in human sperm chemotaxis and may be a critical
component of the fertilization process.

GENE FUNCTION

Nekrasova et al. (1996) overexpressed human (OR17-4) and rat (olp4)
olfactory receptor genes in insect cells, purified them, and
characterized them biochemically. They identified monomeric, dimeric,
and trimeric forms of the proteins corresponding to molecular weights of
32, 69, and 94 kD by electrophoresis. The oligomers were resistant to
reduction and alkylation and were therefore thought to be held together
by SDS-resistant hydrophobic interactions, consistent with observations
of other G protein-coupled receptors.

MAPPING

By isotopic in situ hybridization, Schurmans et al. (1993) mapped the
OLFR1 gene to 17p13-p12 with a peak at band 17p13. A minor peak was
detected on chromosome 3, with a maximum in the region 3q13-q21. After
MspI digestion, a RFLP was demonstrated. Using this in a study of 3 CEPH
pedigrees, they demonstrated linkage with D17S126 at 17pter-p12; maximum
lod = 3.6 at theta = 0.0. Used as a probe on Southern blots under
moderately stringent conditions, the cDNA hybridized to at least 3
closely related genes.

GENE FAMILY

Buck and Axel (1991) discovered this large family of genes encoding
putative odorant receptor genes. The isolation of OR genes from the rat
by Buck and Axel (1991) was based on 3 assumptions. First, ORs are
likely G protein-coupled receptors, which characteristically are
7-transmembrane proteins. Second, ORs are likely members of a multigene
family of considerable size, because an immense number of chemicals with
vastly different structures can be detected and discriminated by the
vertebrate olfactory system. Third, ORs are likely expressed selectively
in olfactory sensory neurons.

Issel-Tarver and Rine (1997) performed a comparative study of 4
subfamilies of olfactory receptor genes first identified in the dog to
assess changes in the gene family during mammalian evolution, and to
begin linking the dog genetic map to that of humans. These 4 families
were designated by them OLF1, OLF2, OLF3, and OLF4 in the canine genome.
The subfamilies represented by these 4 genes range in size from 2 to 20
genes. They are all expressed in canine olfactory epithelium but were
not detectably expressed in canine lung, liver, ovary, spleen, testis,
or tongue. The OLF1 and OLF2 subfamilies are tightly linked in the dog
genome and also in the human genome. The smallest family is represented
by the canine OLF1 gene. Using dog gene probes individually to hybridize
to Southern blots of genomic DNA from 24 somatic cell hybrid lines,
Issel-Tarver and Rine (1997) showed that the human homologous OLF1
subfamily maps to human chromosome 11. The human gene with the strongest
similarity to the canine OLF2 gene also mapped to chromosome 11. Both
members of the human subfamily that hybridized to canine OLF3 were
located on chromosome 7. It was difficult to determine to which
chromosome or chromosomes the human genes that hybridized to the canine
OLF4 probe mapped. This subfamily is large in mouse and hamster as well
as human, so the rodent background largely obscured the human
cross-hybridizing bands. It was possible, however, to discern some
human-specific bands in blots corresponding to human chromosome 19.
Issel-Tarver and Rine (1997) refined the mapping of the human OLF1
homolog by hybridization to YACs that map to 11q11. In dogs, the OLF1
and OLF2 subfamilies are within 45 kb of one another (Issel-Tarver and
Rine (1996)). Issel-Tarver and Rine (1997) demonstrated that in the
human OLF1 and OLF2 homologs are likewise closely linked. By studying
YACs, Issel-Tarver and Rine (1997) found that the human OLF3 homolog
maps to 7q35. A chromosome 19-specific cosmid library was screened by
hybridization with the canine OLF4 gene probe, and clones that
hybridized strongly to the probe even at high stringency were localized
to 19p13.1 and 19p13.2. These clones accounted, however, for a small
fraction of the homologous human bands.

Rouquier et al. (1998) demonstrated that members of the olfactory
receptor gene family are distributed on all but a few human chromosomes.
Through fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis, they showed that OR
sequences reside at more than 25 locations in the human genome. Their
distribution was biased for terminal bands of chromosome arms.
Flow-sorted chromosomes were used to isolate 87 OR sequences derived
from 16 chromosomes. Their sequence relationships indicated the inter-
and intrachromosomal duplications responsible for OR family expansion.
Rouquier et al. (1998) determined that the human genome has accumulated
a striking number of dysfunctional copies: 72% of these sequences were
found to be pseudogenes. ORF-containing sequences predominate on
chromosomes 7, 16, and 17.

Zhao et al. (1998) provided functional proof that one OR gene encodes a
receptor for odorants.

Mombaerts (1999) reviewed the molecular biology of the odorant receptor
genes in vertebrates. According to Mombaerts (1999), the sequences of
more than 150 human OR clones had been reported. The human OR genes
differ markedly from their counterparts in other species by their high
frequency of pseudogenes, except the testicular OR genes. Research
showed that individual olfactory sensory neurons express a small subset
of the OR repertoire. In rat and mouse, axons of neurons expressing the
same OR converge onto defined glomeruli in the olfactory bulb.

Fuchs et al. (2001), who referred to the repertoire of olfactory
receptor genes as the olfactory subgenome, analyzed 224 such genes
derived by a literature survey, data mining at 14 genomic clusters, and
an OR-targeted experimental sequencing strategy. This set of genes
contained at least 53% pseudogenes and was minimally divided into 11
gene families. One family has undergone a particularly extensive
expansion in primates.

The online database of human olfactory receptor genes designated HORDE
(Human Olfactory Receptor Data Exploratorium) stated in 2002 that 906
human olfactory receptor genes had been identified and that more than
60% appeared to be pseudogenes. Only chromosomes 20 and Y appeared to be
devoid of olfactory receptor genes. Chromosome 11 contained the largest
number of OR genes, clustered on the short arm near the centromere and
telomere.

- Olfactory Receptor Gene Cluster on 17p

Ben-Arie et al. (1994) cloned 16 human OLFR genes, all from 17p13.3. The
intronless coding regions are mapped to a 350-kb contiguous cluster,
with an average intergenic separation of 15 kb. The OLFR genes in the
cluster belong to 4 different gene subfamilies, displaying as much
sequence variability as any randomly selected group of OLFRs. This
suggested that the cluster may be one of several copies of an ancestral
OLFR gene repertoire whose existence may have predated the divergence of
mammals. Localization to 17p13.3 was performed by fluorescence in situ
hybridization as well as by somatic cell hybrid mapping.

Glusman et al. (1996) described the results of complete sequencing of an
OR-rich cosmid spanning the center of the OR gene cluster on 17p13.3.
The resulting 40-kb sequence revealed 3 known OR coding regions, 2 OR
genes which may have originated from a tandem duplication event, and a
new OR pseudogene fused to another OR gene.

Olfactory receptor genes are organized in the mammalian genome in many
clusters. The cluster on 17p13.3, fully sequenced by Glusman et al.
(2000), includes 17 OR genes out of the expected several hundred in the
human olfactory subgenome. The OR genes in this cluster belong to
various families and subfamilies. Conversely, genes from the same family
have been found in different clusters and on different chromosomes
(Sullivan et al., 1996; Rouquier et al., 1998), suggesting a complex
history of gene and cluster duplications. By 'data mining,' Glusman et
al. (2000) identified 831 OR coding regions (including pseudogenes) in
24 vertebrate species. A nomenclature system for the OR gene superfamily
was proposed, based on a divergence evolutionary model.

- Gene Function

The ability to distinguish different odors depends on a large number of
different odorant receptors (ORs). Sullivan et al. (1996) noted that ORs
are expressed by nasal olfactory sensory neurons; each neuron expresses
only 1 allele of a single OR gene. In the nose, different sets of ORs
are expressed in distinct spatial zones. Neurons that express the same
OR gene are located in the same zone; however, in that zone they are
randomly interspersed with neurons expressing other ORs. This
distribution suggested to the authors that, when the cell chooses an OR
gene for expression, it may be restricted to a specific zonal gene set,
but it may select from that set by a stochastic mechanism. Proposed
models of OR gene choice fall into 2 classes: locus-dependent and
locus-independent. Locus-dependent models posit that OR genes are
clustered in the genome, perhaps with members of different zonal gene
sets clustered at distinct loci. In contrast, locus-independent models
do not require that OR genes be clustered. To assess the feasibility of
these models, Sullivan et al. (1996) determined the expression zones,
sequences, and chromosomal locations of a number of mouse OR genes. They
mapped OR genes to 11 different regions on 7 chromosomes. These loci lie
within paralogous chromosomal regions that appear to have arisen by
duplications of large chromosomal domains followed by extensive gene
duplication and divergence. These studies showed that OR genes expressed
in the same zone map to numerous loci; moreover, a single locus can
contain genes expressed in different zones. These findings raised the
possibility that OR gene choice is locus-independent or involved
consecutive stochastic choices.

Mammals are able to detect a wide diversity of scents; even the
relatively olfactorily impaired human species is capable of detecting
approximately 10,000 distinct scents (Buck and Axel, 1991). To achieve
such diversity, mammals have approximately 1,000 olfactory genes, which
account for approximately 3% of their entire genome (Mombaerts, 1999).
The ORs are believed to be 7-helix transmembrane proteins, with an
odorant-binding site on the periplasmic domain and a G protein-binding
site on the cytoplasmic domain. Odorants first bind to an OR, which then
undergoes a structural change that triggers the G protein activation and
the following cascade of events leading to nerve cell activity. Wang et
al. (2003) hypothesized that metal ions play an important role in
odorant recognition. They analyzed the predicted structure and consensus
sequence of the ORs and proposed a metal-binding site in the loop
between the fourth and fifth helices (4-5 loop). They synthesized a
pentapeptide that contains this putative binding site and found that it
not only has high affinity for binding Cu(II) and Zn(II) ions, but also
undergoes a dramatic transition to an alpha-helical structure upon metal
ion binding. Based on these observations, they proposed a 'shuttlecock'
mechanism for the possible structural change in ORs upon odorant
binding. This mechanism involves membrane penetration of the 4-5 loop
after residue charge neutralization by metal ion binding.

The report of Zou and Buck (2006), which concluded that binary odorant
mixes stimulate cortical neurons that are not stimulated by their
individual component odorants, was retracted by Buck, who was not able
to reproduce the results. Zou declined to sign the retraction.

In mammals, odorant receptors direct the axons of olfactory sensory
neurons (OSNs) toward targets in the olfactory bulb. Imai et al. (2006)
showed that cyclic adenosine monophosphatase (cAMP) signals that
regulate the expression of axon guidance molecules are essential for the
odorant receptor-instructed axonal projection. Genetic manipulations of
odorant receptors, stimulatory G protein (GNAS; 139320), cAMP-dependent
protein kinase (PKA; see 176911), and cAMP response element-binding
protein (CREB; 123810) shifted the axonal projection sites along the
anterior-posterior axis in the olfactory bulb. Thus, it is the odorant
receptor-derived cAMP signals, rather than the direct action of OR
molecules, that determine the target destination of olfactory sensory
neurons.

- Evolution

Trask et al. (1998) characterized a subtelomeric DNA duplication that
provided insight into the variability, complexity, and evolutionary
history of that unusual region of the human genome, the telomere. Using
a DNA segment cloned from chromosome 19, they demonstrated that the
blocks of DNA sequence shared by different chromosomes can be very large
and highly similar. Three chromosomes appeared to have contained the
sequence before humans migrated around the world. In contrast to its
multicopy distribution in humans, this subtelomeric block maps
predominantly to a single locus in chimpanzee and gorilla, that site
being nonorthologous to any of the locations in the human genome. Three
new members of the olfactory receptor (OR) gene family were found to be
duplicated within this large segment of DNA, which was found to be
present at 3q, 15q, and 19p in each of 45 unrelated humans sampled from
various populations. From its sequence, one of the OR genes in this
duplicated block appeared to be potentially functional. The findings
raised the possibility that functional diversity in the OR family is
generated in part through duplications and interchromosomal
rearrangements of the DNA near human telomeres.

Gilad et al. (2000) reported the population sequence diversity of
genomic segments within a 450-kb cluster of olfactory receptor genes on
chromosome 17. They found a dichotomy in the pattern of nucleotide
diversity between OR pseudogenes and introns on the one hand and the
closely interspersed intact genes on the other. They suggested that weak
positive selection is responsible for the observed patterns of genetic
variation. This was inferred from a lower ratio of polymorphism to
divergence in genes compared with pseudogenes or introns, high
nonsynonymous substitution rates in OR genes, and a small but
significant overall reduction in variability in the entire OR gene
cluster compared with other genomic regions. The dichotomy among
functionally distinct segments within a short genomic distance requires
high recombination rates within this OR cluster.

Young and Trask (2002) reviewed the evolution and physiology of the
olfactory receptor gene superfamily.

Gilad et al. (2003) stated that approximately 40% of the more than 1,000
OR genes in the human have an intact coding region and are therefore
putatively functional. In contrast, the fraction of intact OR genes in
the genomes of the great apes is significantly greater (68 to 72%),
suggesting that selective pressures on the OR repertoire vary among
these species. Gilad et al. (2003) examined the evolutionary forces that
shaped the OR gene family in humans and chimpanzees by resequencing 20
OR genes in 16 humans, 16 chimpanzees, and 1 orangutan. They compared
the variation at the OR genes with that at intergenic regions. In both
humans and chimpanzees, OR pseudogenes seemed to evolve neutrally. In
chimpanzees, patterns of variability were consistent with purifying
selection acting on intact OR genes, whereas, in humans, there was
suggestive evidence for positive selection acting on intact OR genes.
These observations were considered to be due to differences in
lifestyle, between humans and great apes, that led to distinct sensory
needs.

- Other Features

Young et al. (2008) undertook a detailed study of copy number variation
of olfactory receptors to elucidate the selective and mechanistic forces
acting on this gene family and the true impact of copy number variation
on human olfactory receptor repertoires. They argued that the properties
of copy number variants (CNVs) and other sets of large genomic regions
violate the assumptions of statistical methods that are commonly used in
the assessment of gene enrichment. Using more appropriate methods, Young
et al. (2008) provided evidence that OR enrichment in CNVs is not due to
positive selection but is because of OR preponderance in segmentally
duplicated regions, which are known to be frequently copy
number-variable, and because purifying selection against CNVs is lower
in OR-containing regions than in regions containing essential genes.
Young et al. (2008) also combined multiplex ligation-dependent probe
amplification (MLPA) and PCR to assay the copy numbers of 37 candidate
CNV ORs in a panel of approximately 50 individuals. The authors
confirmed copy number variation of 18 ORs but found no variation in this
human diversity panel for 16 others, highlighting the caveat that
reported intervals often overrepresent true CNVs. Young et al. (2008)
concluded that the copy number variation they describe is likely to
underpin significant variation in olfactory abilities among human
individuals and showed that both homology-based and homology-independent
processes have played a recent role in remodeling the OR family.

ANIMAL MODEL

Issel-Tarver and Rine (1996) characterized 4 members of the canine
olfactory receptor gene family. The 4 subfamilies comprised genes
expressed exclusively in olfactory epithelium. Analysis of large DNA
fragments using Southern blots of pulsed field gels indicated that
subfamily members were clustered together, and that 2 of the subfamilies
were closely linked in the dog genome. Analysis of the 4 olfactory
receptor gene subfamilies in 26 breeds of dog provided evidence that the
number of genes per subfamily was stable in spite of differential
selection on the basis of olfactory acuity in scent hounds, sight
hounds, and toy breeds.

614547	TITLE *614547 FAMILY WITH SEQUENCE SIMILARITY 103, MEMBER A1; FAM103A1
;;RNMT-ACTIVATING MINIPROTEIN; RAM
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The 5-prime methyl cap targets mRNAs for regulatory processes and
protects mRNA from exonucleases. The cap is made up of a
7-methylguanosine linked to the 5-prime hydroxyl group of the mRNA
through a triphosphate linkage to create a structure designated
m7G(5-prime)ppp(5-prime)X, where X is the first transcribed nucleotide.
FAM103A1, or RAM, interacts with the cap methyltransferase RNMT (603514)
and is required for cap methylation by RNMT (Gonatopoulos-Pournatzis et
al., 2011).

CLONING

Using mass spectrometry to identify a protein that immunoprecipitated
with RNMT from human embryonic kidney 293 cell lysates, followed by PCR
of HeLa cell cDNA, Gonatopoulos-Pournatzis et al. (2011) cloned
FAM103A1, which they called RAM. The deduced 118-amino acid protein has
a central asn- and arg-rich domain followed by a C-terminal pro-, glu-,
and tyr-rich domain. Immunofluorescence analysis of HeLa cells showed
that RAM localized predominantly to nuclei. RAM had an apparent
molecular mass of 14 kD by SDS-PAGE. Database analysis revealed
orthologs of RAM in vertebrates only, but these orthologs were well
conserved.

GENE FUNCTION

Using immunoprecipitation analysis, Gonatopoulos-Pournatzis et al.
(2011) confirmed interaction between RAM and RNMT1 in several human cell
lines. Gel filtration of HeLa cell extracts detected RAM and RNMT in a
high molecular mass complex of about 200 kD. No RAM or RNMT monomers
were detected. RNA band-shift assays showed that RAM, but not RNMT,
interacted with RNA rather than the cap structure. Thin layer
chromatography and quantitative phosphoimaging showed that recombinant
RNMT, but not RAM, catalyzed methylation of the cap in a dose-dependent
manner. Addition of RAM increased the cap methyltransferase activity of
RNMT, and equimolar concentrations of RAM and RNMT resulted in highest
cap methyltransferase activity. Mutation analysis revealed that amino
acids 1 to 55 of RAM interacted with the methyltransferase domain of
RNMT and were sufficient to activate RNMT-dependent cap methylation. The
asn- and arg-rich region of RAM (amino acids 56 to 90) bound RNA.
Knockdown of RAM in HeLa cells via small interfering RNA resulted in
loss of RNMT expression and loss of cap methyltransferase activity.
Knockdown of RAM also caused loss of polysomes and reduced protein
synthesis, consistent with loss of mRNA translation. Knockdown of RNMT
caused loss of RAM expression, suggesting that the 2 proteins stabilize
each other. Gonatopoulos-Pournatzis et al. (2011) concluded that RAM is
essential for RNMT cap methyltransferase activity.

MAPPING

Hartz (2012) mapped the FAM103A1 gene to chromosome 15q25.2 based on an
alignment of the FAM103A1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK027095) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

107310	TITLE *107310 SOLUTE CARRIER FAMILY 9, MEMBER 1; SLC9A1
;;ANTIPORTER, SODIUM-HYDROGEN ION, AMILORIDE-SENSITIVE; APNH;;
SODIUM/HYDROGEN EXCHANGER 1; NHE1;;
Na+/H+ ANTIPORTER
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The Na+/H+ antiporter (SLC9A1) is a ubiquitous membrane-bound enzyme
involved in pH regulation of vertebrate cells. It is specifically
inhibited by the diuretic drug amiloride and activated by a variety of
signals including growth factors, mitogens, neurotransmitters, tumor
promoters, and others (Mattei et al., 1988).

CLONING

Mattei et al. (1987) used reverse genetics to clone the SLC9A1 gene. The
gene was first disrupted in mouse fibroblasts. The lost function was
then restored by transfection with human genomic DNA. Southern analysis
of secondary and tertiary mouse transfectants demonstrated that unique
EcoRI fragments containing 50 to 60 kb of human DNA were specifically
retained in transfectants expressing Na+/H+ exchange activity (Franchi
et al., 1986). Clones containing these specific human sequences were
isolated. One genomic fragment was identified as an exon-coding sequence
from the sodium-hydrogen ion antiporter gene by demonstration that it
could complement antiporter deficiency in mouse cells; that it
recognized an mRNA in cells expressing antiport activity but not in
deficient cells; and that it was amplified in variants overexpressing
antiport activity.

Sardet et al. (1989) presented the complete sequence of a cDNA encoding
SLC9A1.

GENE FUNCTION

Denker et al. (2000) showed that the plasma membrane ion exchanger NHE1
(SLC9A1) acts as an anchor for actin filaments to control the integrity
of the cortical cytoskeleton. This occurs through a previously
unrecognized structural link between NHE1 and the actin-binding proteins
ezrin (123900), radixin (179410), and moesin (309845), which are
collectively referred to as ERM proteins. NHE1 and ERM proteins were
found to associate directly and colocalize in lamellipodia. Fibroblasts
expressing NHE1 with mutations that disrupted binding with ERM proteins
but not ion translocation had impaired organization of focal adhesions
and actin stress fibers and an irregular cell shape. Denker et al.
(2000) proposed a structural role for NHE1 in regulating the cortical
cytoskeleton that is independent of its function as an ion exchanger.

Dudley et al. (1990) pointed out that SLC9A1 is a plausible candidate
gene for human essential hypertension (145500).

Lifton et al. (1991) excluded linkage between elevated sodium-lithium
countertransport, which is elevated in patients with essential
hypertension, and the APNH gene. In an analysis of 93 hypertensive sib
pairs, they further demonstrated that APNH explained none of the
variance in sodium-lithium countertransport. They directly tested for
linkage of APNH to genes predisposing to hypertension by analysis of
linkage in hypertensive sib pairs. Mean allele sharing at APNH was not
greater than expected from random assortment in hypertensive sibs.

MAPPING

The genomic probe reported by Mattei et al. (1987) was used to map the
APNH gene to 1p36.1-p35 by in situ hybridization (Mattei et al., 1988).
Mattei et al. (1989) used in situ hybridization of the human cDNA probe
to map the antiporter gene to the distal portion of mouse chromosome 4
and to the long arm of Chinese hamster chromosome 2, confirming the
conserved homology between the distal part of human chromosome 1p, the
mouse distal 4, and Chinese hamster distal 2q. By the analysis of
fragment length variations in recombinant inbred strains, Morahan and
Rakar (1993) likewise mapped the Nhe1 gene to mouse chromosome 4,
between Lck and Akp2. Lifton et al. (1990) used genomic clones of the
SLC9A1 gene to identify 2 polymorphisms. Using these RFLPs in 59
reference families, they found that the antiporter gene lies 3 cM
proximal to the RH locus. Dudley et al. (1990) PCR-amplified a 376-bp
fragment corresponding to the 5-prime end of SLC9A1 and detected a
polymorphism within this fragment by denaturing gradient gel
electrophoresis. By genetic linkage studies, they mapped SLC9A1
telomeric to D1S57 and close to RH (111700) and ALPL (171760).

609739	TITLE *609739 IMMUNOGLOBULIN-LIKE DOMAIN-CONTAINING RECEPTOR 1; ILDR1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a subtractive hybridization strategy on follicular (FL) and
histologic transformed (DLBCL) lymphomas, followed by EST database
analysis and RT-PCR of prostate and DLBCL cDNA libraries, Hauge et al.
(2004) cloned 3 splice variants of ILDR1 that they designated
ILDR1-alpha, ILDR1-alpha-prime, and ILDR1-beta. The predicted proteins
contain 546, 514, and 457 amino acids, respectively. ILDR1-alpha is a
type I membrane protein with a signal sequence, an Ig-like extracellular
domain, a transmembrane region, and a C-terminal domain containing a
cysteine-rich region, which is probably involved in interactions with
other proteins, a dileucine motif, which may promote internalization and
intracellular sorting, and an arginine-rich region. ILDR1-alpha-prime
has 39 unique N-terminal residues and lacks the dileucine motif.
ILDR1-beta lacks the cysteine-rich region and the transmembrane region
and is therefore likely to be a soluble protein. ILDR1 shares homology
with rat lipolysis-stimulated receptor (Lsr), suggesting that ILDR1 may
be involved in lipoprotein transport. Immunoblot analysis showed
expression of 70-kD (alpha), 66-kD (alpha-prime) and 60-kD (beta) ILDR1
proteins under reducing conditions. Immunofluorescence microscopy
demonstrated cell membrane localization of ILDR1-alpha and -alpha-prime,
while ILDR1-beta localized to the cytosol. Analysis of cotransfected
cells suggested that all 3 variants interact at the cytoplasmic
membrane. Northern blot analysis using ILDR1-alpha-prime as probe
revealed highest expression in prostate, with much lower expression in
testis, pancreas, kidney, heart, and liver. ILDR1 was also expressed
myeloma, lymphoblastoma, and Hodgkin lymphoma cell lines. RT-PCR
analysis of lymphomas indicated no association of ILDR1 with
transformation, but nearly all FL and DLBCL samples expressed
ILDR1-beta, whereas normal tissues and leukemia and histiocytic lymphoma
lines did not. Hauge et al. (2004) proposed that ILDR1-beta may have
diagnostic marker potential.

Borck et al. (2011) found Ildr1 expression in the developing mouse
cochlea and vestibule. The most abundant transcript contained exon 6,
likely representing the full-length 537-residue isoform. Expression in
the organ of Corti was low at P1 and increased gradually at P4 and P10.
Expression was detected at low to intermediate levels in hair cells and
at higher levels in a subset of supporting cells. In developing
zebrafish, Ildr1 was detected in several derivatives of the preplacodal
ectoderm, including the adenohypophyseal placode, the olfactory
epithelium, and, notably, the otic vesicle and the primordium of the
posterior lateral line, which gives rise to the neuromast-containing
lateral line organ.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hauge et al. (2004) determined that the ILDR1 gene contains 8 exons.
ILDR1-alpha has all 8 exons, ILDR1-alpha-prime has 39 unique codons in
exon 1 fused to exon 2 and lacks exon 6, and ILDR1-beta lacks exons 4
and 5.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Hauge et al. (2004) mapped the ILDR1 gene
to chromosome 3q21.1.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Borck et al. (2011) identified 10 different homozygous mutations in the
ILDR1 gene (see, e.g., 609739.0001-609739.0004) in affected members of
11 unrelated families with autosomal recessive nonsyndromic
sensorineural deafness-42 (DFNB42; 609646). Seven of the mutations were
predicted to result in a truncated protein, consistent with loss of
function. The hearing impairment in these families was prelingual,
bilateral, and moderate to profound. In most affected individuals, the
hearing impairment was more pronounced at higher frequencies, but some
had a flat audiogram.

In affected members of a large consanguineous Pakistani family with
autosomal recessive deafness-42 (DFNB42; 609646), Borck et al. (2011)
identified a homozygous 1135G-T transversion in exon 7 of the ILDR1
gene, resulting in a glu379-to-ter (E379X) substitution predicted to
affect 4 ILDR1 isoforms. The mutant mRNA is either subject to
nonsense-mediated decay or predicts a protein that lacks the
arginine-rich region and the 14-3-3-binding site. The mutation was not
found in 1,000 Pakistani control chromosomes.

determined. The mutation was not found in 500 control chromosome.

ILDR1 gene, resulting in a gln195-to-ter (Q195X) substitution. The
mutation was not found in 120 control chromosomes.

et al. (2011) identified a 1-bp deletion (1032delG) in exon 7 of the
ILDR1 gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature termination. The
mutation was not found in 500 control chromosomes. Haplotype analysis
indicated a founder effect.

608160	TITLE *608160 SRY-BOX 9; SOX9
;;SRY-RELATED HMG-BOX GENE 9
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SOX9 is a transcription factor essential for both sex and skeletal
development. Transient expression of the Y chromosome gene SRY (480000)
initiates a cascade of gene interactions orchestrated by SOX9, leading
to the formation of testes from bipotential gonads (summary by Cox et
al., 2011).

CLONING

Foster et al. (1994) constructed a high-resolution map across a 20-Mb
region spanning chromosome 17q24.1-q25.1 that was identified by Tommerup
et al. (1993) as containing the locus for campomelic dysplasia (CMPD;
114290). Using this map and a translocation chromosome breakpoint from a
sex-reversed patient with campomelic dysplasia (see 114290) previously
reported by Young et al. (1992), Foster et al. (1994) identified an SRY
(480000)-related gene, SOX9, located 88 kb distal to the translocation
breakpoint. The gene is predicted to encode a 509-amino acid polypeptide
containing an SRY homology domain. The isolated cDNA corresponded to 3.9
kb of the transcript, but Northern blot analysis detected a 4.5-kb
transcript in adult testes, adult heart, and fetal brain. The SOX9
protein HMG box domain at amino acids 104-182 showed 71% similarity with
the SRY HMG box, and the C-terminal third of the protein has a proline-
and glutamine-rich region similar to activation domains present in some
transcription factors. The genomic arrangement of SOX9 is such that the
5-prime end is oriented toward the centromere of chromosome 17 and
closest to the breakpoint. It is possible that 1 or more exons are
present 5-prime to the known exons and that these are disrupted by the
translocation.

Using a fragment derived from mouse SOX9, Wagner et al. (1994) isolated
human SOX9 from a human fetal cDNA brain library. The cDNA was found to
encode a 509-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 56
kD.

By immunohistochemical analysis of adult human and mouse tissues,
Furuyama et al. (2011) found that SOX9 was expressed in hepatic bile
duct, duodenal crypt, and pancreatic duct. In mouse, Sox9 was detected
in extrahepatic biliary tract epithelia, including the common bile duct,
duodenal papilla, and gall bladder. Sox9 was detected broadly in
primitive gut epithelial cells in developing mouse at embryonic days
13.5 and 16.5 and was restricted to crypt at embryonic day 18.5. In
pancreas, Sox9 was expressed in epithelial cells at embryonic day 13.5
and was confined to duct cells and was not present in differentiated
cells at embryonic days 16.5 and 18.5. Sox9 was detected in extrahepatic
bile duct, but not in hepatocytes, at embryonic day 13.5 and was
expressed in intrahepatic bile duct at embryonic day 16.5.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Foster et al. (1994) localized
the SOX9 gene to chromosome 17q24.

Wagner et al. (1994) cited evidence that the murine Sox9 gene is on
chromosome 11.

GENE FUNCTION

- Role in Chondrogenesis

During chondrogenesis in the mouse, Sox9 is coexpressed with Col2a1
(120140), the gene encoding type II collagen, the major cartilage matrix
protein. COL2A1 is therefore a candidate regulatory target of SOX9.
Regulatory sequences required for chondrocyte-specific expression of the
COL2A1 gene have been localized to conserved sequences in the first
intron in rats, mice, and humans. Bell et al. (1997) showed that SOX9
protein binds specifically to sequences in the first intron of human
COL2A1. Mutation of these sequences abolished SOX9 binding and
chondrocyte-specific expression of a COL2A1-driven reporter gene
(COL2A1-lacZ) in transgenic mice. Furthermore, ectopic expression of
Sox9 transactivated both a COL2A1-driven reporter gene and the
endogenous Col2a1 gene in transgenic mice. These results demonstrated
that COL2A1 expression is directly regulated by SOX9 protein in vivo and
implicated abnormal regulation of COL2A1 during chondrogenesis as a
cause of the skeletal abnormalities associated with campomelic
dysplasia.

Murakami et al. (2000) showed that expression of SOX9 is upregulated by
fibroblast growth factors (FGFs; see 601513) in primary chondrocytes and
in SOX9-expressing mesenchymal cells. They further presented evidence
that FGF stimulation of SOX9 expression is mediated by the
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade (see 176948), a signal
transduction pathway that is activated by growth factors such as FGF.
The data strongly suggested that FGF and the MAPK pathway play an
important role in the regulation of SOX9 expression during chondrocyte
differentiation.

Huang et al. (2001) showed that the chondrogenic transcription factor
SOX9 is a target of signaling by the parathyroid hormone-related peptide
(PTHRP; 168470) in the growth plate of endochondral bones. PTHRP
strongly increased the phosphorylation of SOX9 and increased the
SOX9-dependent activity of chondrocyte-specific enhancers in the gene
for type II collagen (COL2A1) in transient transfection experiments.
This increased enhancer activity did not occur with a SOX9 mutant
harboring serine-to-alanine substitutions in its 2 consensus protein
kinase A phosphorylation sites. Since SOX9 is a target of PTHRP
signaling in prehypertrophic chondrocytes in the growth plate, Huang et
al. (2001) hypothesized that SOX9 mediates at least some effects of
PTHRP in the growth plate and that the PTHRP-dependent increased
transcriptional activity of SOX9 helps maintain the chondrocyte
phenotype of cells in the prehypertrophic zone and inhibits their
maturation to hypertrophic chondrocytes.

Komeda miniature rat Ishikawa (KMI) is a naturally occurring rat mutant
that grows normally until 3 to 4 weeks of age, but then gradually
develops longitudinal growth retardation without other organ
abnormalities. Chikuda et al. (2004) found that expression of Sox9,
which is normally downregulated in postmitotic chondrocytes, persisted
in the nuclei of KMI growth plate chondrocytes. They determined that KMI
rats have a deletion in the cGKII gene (PRKG2; 601591) that results in a
truncated protein lacking the kinase domain. Transfection experiments in
human cells revealed that cGKII phosphorylates SOX9 on ser181 and
attenuates SOX9 function by inhibiting its nuclear entry. Furthermore,
the impaired differentiation of cultured KMI chondrocytes was restored
by silencing Sox9 by RNA interference. Chikuda et al. (2004) concluded
that cGKII is a molecular switch that couples the cessation of
proliferation and the start of hypertrophic chondrocyte differentiation
through attenuating SOX9 function.

- Role in Sex Determination

Morais da Silva et al. (1996) found that, consistent with its role in
sex determination, SOX9 expression closely follows differentiation of
Sertoli cells in the mouse testis, in experimental sex reversal when
fetal ovaries are grafted to adult kidneys, and in the chick where there
is no evidence for an Sry gene (480000). The results suggested to the
authors that SOX9 plays an essential role in sex determination, possibly
immediately downstream of SRY in mammals, and that it functions as a
critical Sertoli cell differentiation factor, perhaps in all
vertebrates.

In most mammals, male development is triggered by the transient
expression of the SRY gene on the Y chromosome, which initiates a
cascade of gene interactions ultimately leading to the formation of a
testis from the indifferent fetal gonad. Several genes, in particular
SOX9, have a crucial role in this pathway. Bishop et al. (2000)
described a dominant insertion mutation, Odsex (Ods), in which XX mice
carrying a 150-kb deletion approximately 1 Mb upstream of Sox9 developed
as sterile XX males lacking Sry. During embryogenesis, wildtype XX fetal
gonads downregulated Sox9 expression, whereas XY and XX Ods/+ fetal
gonads upregulated and maintained its expression. Bishop et al. (2000)
proposed that the Ods mutation removed a long-range, gonad-specific
regulatory element that mediates the repression of Sox9 expression in XX
fetal gonads. This repression would normally be antagonized by Sry
protein in XY embryos. The data were considered consistent with Sox9
being a direct downstream target of Sry and provided genetic evidence to
support a general repressor model of sex determination in mammals.

The Ods mouse phenotype, described by Bishop et al. (2000), consists of
female-to-male sex reversal in XX Ods/+ mice and a characteristic eye
phenotype of microphthalmia with cataracts. The mutation arose in a
transgenic line of mice carrying a tyrosinase (TYR; 606933) minigene
driven by the dopachrome tautomerase (DCT; 191275) promoter region. The
minigene integrated 1 Mb upstream of Sox9 and was accompanied by a
deletion of 134 kb. Ods causes sex reversal in the absence of Sry by
upregulating Sox9 expression and maintaining a male pattern of Sox9
expression in XX Ods/+ embryonic gonads. Qin et al. (2004) reported that
the 134-kb deletion alone was insufficient to cause sex reversal.
Rather, the Dct promoter was capable of acting over a distance of 1 Mb
to induce inappropriate expression of Sox9 in the retinal pigmented
epithelium of the eye, causing the observed microphthalmia. In addition,
it induced Sox9 expression in the melanocytes where it caused
pigmentation defects. Qin et al. (2004) proposed that Ods sex reversal
may be due to the Dct promoter element interacting with gonad-specific
enhancer elements to produce the observed male pattern expression of
Sox9 in the embryonic gonads.

In mammals, male sex determination starts when the Y chromosome Sry gene
is expressed within the undetermined male gonad. One of the earliest
effects of SRY expression is to induce upregulation of SOX9 gene
expression in the developing gonad. SOX9, like SRY, contains a high
mobility group domain and is sufficient to induce testis differentiation
in transgenic XX mice. Before sexual differentiation, SOX9 protein is
initially found in the cytoplasm of undifferentiated gonads from both
sexes. At the time of testis differentiation and anti-mullerian hormone
(AMH; 600957) expression, it becomes localized to the nuclear
compartment in males, whereas it is downregulated in females. Gasca et
al. (2002) used NIH 3T3 cells as a model to examine the regulation of
SOX9 nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. SOX9-transfected cells expressed
nuclear and cytoplasmic SOX9, whereas transfected cells treated with the
nuclear export inhibitor leptomycin B displayed an exclusive nuclear
localization of SOX9. By using SOX9 deletion constructs in GFP fusion
proteins, Gasca et al. (2002) identified a functional nuclear export
signal sequence between amino acids 134 and 147 of the SOX9 high
mobility group box. More strikingly, they showed that inhibiting nuclear
export with leptomycin B in mouse XX gonads cultured in vitro induced a
sex reversal phenotype characterized by nuclear SOX9 and anti-mullerian
hormone expression. These results indicated that the SOX9 nuclear export
signal is essential for SOX9 sex-specific subcellular localization and
could be part of a regulatory switch that represses (in females) or
triggers (in males) male-specific sexual differentiation.

To test whether SOX9 was sufficient to generate a fully fertile male in
the absence of Sry, Qin and Bishop (2005) constructed XY(Sry-) Ods/+
male mice, in which the male phenotype is controlled autosomally by the
Ods mutation. Mice gradually became infertile by 5 to 6 months of life.
XY(Sry-) Ods/+ males also failed to establish the correct male-specific
pattern of vascularization at the time of sex determination. Increasing
the amount of SOX9 by producing homozygous XY(Sry-) Ods/Ods males
completely rescued the phenotype and restored correct vascular
patterning and long-term fertility. Qin and Bishop (2005) showed that
activation of SOX9 in the gonad was sufficient to trigger all the
downstream events needed for the development of a fully fertile male,
and they provided additional evidence that Sox9 may downregulate Wnt4
(603490) expression in the gonad.

- Transcription Factor Activity

By cell transfection experiments, Sudbeck et al. (1996) showed that SOX9
can transactivate transcription from a reporter plasmid through the
motif AACAAAG, a sequence recognized by other HMG domain transcription
factors. By fusing all or part of SOX9 to the DNA-binding domain of
yeast Gal4, the transactivating function was mapped to a transcription
activation domain at the C terminus of SOX9. With 1 exception, all SOX9
nonsense and frameshift mutations in patients with campomelic dysplasia
and sex reversal lead to truncation of this domain, suggesting to
Sudbeck et al. (1996) that impairment of gonadal and skeletal
development in these cases results, at least in part, from loss of the
transactivation of genes downstream of SOX9.

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis of a human embryo cDNA expression library,
Zhou et al. (2002) found that the transcription activation domain of
SOX9 interacted with the proline-, glutamine-, and leucine-rich (PQL)
domain of TRAP230 (MED12; 300188), a component of the thyroid hormone
receptor-associated protein (TRAP) complex. In vitro and in vivo assays
confirmed that the proteins interact endogenously and associate with
several other TRAP complex proteins in HeLa cell nuclear lysates. SOX9
and TRAP230 colocalized in nuclei of cultured human embryo chondrocytes.
The isolated PQL domain of TRAP230 acted as a dominant-negative
inhibitor of SOX9 activity.

Tsuda et al. (2003) found that SOX9 used CBP (CREBBP; 600140) and p300
(EP300; 602700) as transcriptional coactivators. SOX9 bound CBP and p300
in vitro and in vivo, and both coactivators enhanced SOX9-dependent
COL2A1 promoter activity. Disruption of the CBP-SOX9 complex inhibited
COL2A1 mRNA expression and differentiation of human mesenchymal stem
cells into chondrocytes.

Blache et al. (2004) found that Sox9 was expressed in fetal mouse
intestinal epithelium. Expression of Sox9 was dependent on activity of
the Wnt (see 164820) pathway. In human colon-derived epithelial cells,
Blache et al. (2004) demonstrated that SOX9 transcriptionally repressed
the expression of CDX2 (600297) and MUC2 (158370), genes expressed in
the villus compartment encoding markers of differentiated cells. Blache
et al. (2004) hypothesized that SOX9 function might contribute to the
Wnt-dependent maintenance of an undifferentiated progenitor phenotype in
the intestinal epithelium by repressing differentiation genes such as
CDX2 and MUC2.

By expression of Sox9 or Sox10 (602229) in early Xenopus embryos, Taylor
and LaBonne (2005) found that each factor could direct the formation of
neural crest precursors and the development of a range of neural crest
derivatives. They detected no differences in the activities of Sox9 and
Sox10 in these assays. They identified Sumo1 (601912) and Ubc9 (UBE2I;
601661) as Sox-interacting proteins that play a role in regulating the
function of Sox9 and Sox10 during neural crest and inner ear
development.

By analyzing embryonic Sox9-null mice and using gain-of-function
experiments, Cheung et al. (2005) determined that specification of trunk
neural crest cells involves the coordinated activity of Sox9, Foxd3
(611539), and Slug (SNAI2; 602150). Each transcription factor appeared
to regulate the acquisition of distinct neural crest cell properties,
while the combined expression of Sox9, Slug, and Foxd3 induced cells to
manifest all the principal transcriptional and morphologic
characteristics of neural crest cells.

Prostaglandin D2 (176803) contributes to the development of the testis
by recruiting cells of the supporting cell lineage to a Sertoli cell
fate. Wilhelm et al. (2007) found that Pgds was expressed in embryonic
mouse Sertoli cells immediately after the onset of Sry and Sox9
expression. Pgds upregulation was mediated by Sox9, but not Sry, and
required the binding of dimeric Sox9 to a paired SOX recognition site
within the Pgds 5-prime flanking region.

Zalzali et al. (2008) found that expression of epitope-tagged SOX9 in
human colonic carcinoma cells upregulated the expression of CEACAM1
(109770). Conversely, Sox9-deficient mice showed reduced Ceacam1
expression in colon. The promoter regions of mouse, rat, and human
CEACAM1 contain SOX9-binding motifs despite no other significant
sequence homology, and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis confirmed
that SOX9 bound the human CEACAM1 promoter. In addition, the histone
acetyltransferase p300 enhanced transactivation of CEACAM1 by the rat
and human CEACAM1 promoters. Zalzali et al. (2008) concluded that SOX9
regulates CEACAM1 expression in colon epithelium.

- Regulatory Elements

SOX9 is expressed during chondrocyte differentiation and is upregulated
in male and downregulated in female genital ridges during sex
differentiation. To study the sex- and tissue-specific regulation of
SOX9, Kanai and Koopman (1999) defined the transcription start site and
characterized the Sox9 promoter region in the mouse. The Sox9 proximal
promoter shows moderately high nucleotide similarity between mouse and
human. Transient transfection experiments using various deletion
constructs at the 6.8-kb upstream region of the mouse Sox9 gene fused to
a luciferase reporter showed that the interval between 193 and 73 bp
from the transcription start site was essential for maximal promoter
activity in cell lines and in primary male and female gonadal somatic
cells and liver cells isolated from mouse embryos 13.5 days postcoitum.
This minimal promoter region was shown by DNase I hypersensitive site
assay to be in an 'open' state of chromatin structure in gonads of both
sexes, but not in the liver. Promoter activity was higher in testis than
in ovary and liver, but deletion of the region from -193 to -73 bp
abolished this difference. Kanai and Koopman (1999) concluded that the
proximal promoter region is in part responsible for the sex- and
tissue-specific expression of the SOX9 gene, and that more distal
positive and negative elements contribute to its regulation in vivo,
consistent with the observation that translocations upstream from the
SOX9 gene can result in campomelic dysplasia.

Bien-Willner et al. (2007) identified a 2.1-kb cis-acting regulatory
element 1.1 Mb upstream of the SOX9 gene, called SOX9cre1. This element
increased the activity of a minimal SOX9 promoter in reporter constructs
in a dose-dependent manner. The enhancer effect was also tissue-specific
and was observed in human chondrosarcoma cell lines, but not in HeLa
cells. SOX9cre1 contains a GLI1 (165220)-binding element, suggesting
that SOX9 has a role in hedgehog (SHH; 600725) signaling. Stimulation of
primary human chondrocytes in culture with SHH increased endogenous SOX9
expression 3-fold. EMSA and chromatin immunoprecipitation studies showed
a direct interaction between GLI1 and the putative GLI1-binding site in
SOX9cre1. Bien-Willner et al. (2007) concluded that SHH regulates SOX9
expression in human chondrocytes and chondrosarcomas via GLI1 binding to
a far upstream enhancer region.

Sekido and Lovell-Badge (2008) demonstrated that SRY (480000) binds to
multiple elements within a Sox9 gonad-specific enhancer that they called
TESCO (testis-specific enhancer of Sox9 core) in mice, and that it does
so along with steroidogenic factor-1 (SF1) an orphan nuclear receptor
encoded by the gene Nr5a1 (184757). Mutation, cotransfection, and
sex-reversal studies all pointed to a feedforward, self-reinforcing
pathway in which SF1 and SRY cooperatively upregulate SOX9; then,
together with SF1, SOX9 also binds to the enhancer to help maintain its
own expression after that of SRY has ceased. Sekido and Lovell-Badge
(2008) concluded that their results permitted further characterization
of the molecular mechanisms regulating sex determination, their
evolution, and their failure in cases of sex reversal.

- Role in Pigmentation

Passeron et al. (2007) detected SOX9 mRNA and protein in normal human
melanocytes in vitro and in vivo. Ultraviolet B exposure upregulated
SOX9 expression and nuclear accumulation, and upregulation was mediated
by cAMP and protein kinase A (see 176911). Agouti signal protein (ASIP;
600201), which decreases pigmentation and antagonizes the alpha-MSH
(176830) signaling pathway, downregulated SOX9 expression. SOX9
regulated the MITF (156845) and DCT (191275) promoters. Overexpression
of SOX9 increased MITF, DCT, and TYR (606933) proteins, which led to
increased melanin production in cells. Passeron et al. (2007) concluded
that SOX9 has a role in pigmentation.

- Role in Organ Maintenance

Using lineage analysis, Furuyama et al. (2011) showed that Sox9-negative
mouse hepatocytes arose from a Sox9-positive precursor pool. These
Sox9-positive precursors were involved in liver regeneration following
hepatic injury. Embryonic pancreatic Sox9-expressing cells
differentiated into all types of mature cells, but their capacity for
endocrine differentiation diminished shortly after birth, when endocrine
cells detached from the epithelial lining of the ducts and formed the
islets of Langerhans. Since SOX9 was expressed in proliferating
intestinal crypt cells and in hepatic and pancreatic duct in the adult,
Furuyama et al. (2011) concluded that SOX9 is involved in the continuous
supply of cells from the progenitor pool.

- Role in Cancer

Wang et al. (2008) noted that, in adult prostate, SOX9 expression is
restricted to basal epithelium. By immunohistochemical analysis of human
fetal prostate, they found that SOX9 was initially expressed in prostate
epithelium at 19 weeks gestation. By 22.5 weeks, expression was more
pronounced at the tip of the branching prostate gland that was expanding
into the surrounding stroma. In xenografts of human prostate cancer cell
lines, SOX9 overexpression enhanced tumor growth, whereas knockdown of
SOX9 via small interfering RNA suppressed tumor growth. Wang et al.
(2008) concluded that during normal development SOX9 allows the prostate
epithelium to outgrow into the mesenchyme and then provides basal cell
support for development and maintenance of the luminal epithelium. They
suggested that these functions of SOX9 are subverted in prostate cancer
to support tumor growth and invasion.

Passeron et al. (2009) found weak or absent SOX9 expression in 37 (95%)
of 39 melanoma (155600) specimens. SOX9 expression was positive in
normal skin areas, but weak or negative in 18 (81.8%) of 22 nevi, in 54
(96.4%) of 56 primary melanomas, and in 100% (20 of 20) metastatic
melanomas. Thus, SOX9 expression decreased as melanocytic cells
progressed from the normal condition to the premalignant (nevi) to the
transformed state, and was completely negative in the most advanced
(metastatic) state of malignancy. SOX9 functioned by binding the CDKN1A
(116899) promoter, which resulted in strong suppression of cell growth
in vivo. SOX9 also decreased PRAME (606021) protein levels in melanoma
cells and restored sensitivity to retinoic acid. SOX9 overexpression in
melanoma cell lines inhibited tumorigenicity both in mice and in a human
ex vivo model of melanoma. Treatment of melanoma cell lines with PGD2
(176803) increased SOX9 expression and restored sensitivity to retinoic
acid. Combined treatment with PGD2 and retinoic acid substantially
decreased tumor growth in human ex vivo and mouse in vivo models of
melanoma. These results provided insight into the pathophysiology of
melanoma.

- Effects of Chromosomal Translocations on SOX9

Many patients with campomelic dysplasia have chromosomal translocations
involving regions surrounding or including the SOX9 gene. Wagner et al.
(1994) found that the 17q breakpoints in 3 campomelic dysplasia patients
with translocations mapped 50 kb or more from the SOX9 gene. Wirth et
al. (1996) showed that the breakpoints in 2 affected patients reported
by Wagner et al. (1994) were more than 130 kb 5-prime of SOX9, as was
the breakpoint in a third patient with CMPD and a de novo t(6;17)
translocation. The last patient was a phenotypic female with XY sex
chromosome constitution, as were the 3 previously described CMPD
translocation cases. Wirth et al. (1996) reviewed the mechanisms by
which translocation breakpoints upstream from the SOX9 gene can result
in defective expression during embryonic development. In their study,
Wirth et al. (1996) investigated whether there was any difference in the
expression of SOX9 alleles on the normal versus the translocation
chromosome. No significant difference was found in the study of a
lymphoblastoid cell line; however, they pointed out that this may not
accurately reflect the situation of regulated expression of SOX9 during
embryonic development. It had not been possible to analyze SOX9
expression in embryonic tissue from CMPD translocation cases. In a note
added in proof, they referred to 3 additional de novo translocation or
inversion cases involving the distal 17q in patients with CMPD.

Because chromosomal breakpoints map 50 kb or more from the SOX9 gene and
CMPD may be a contiguous gene syndrome (Schmickel, 1986), Ninomiya et
al. (1996) cloned the breakpoint in the patient in search of a second
gene associated with this syndrome. They isolated a cDNA adjacent to the
breakpoint. Specific expression of this gene in testis suggested its
candidacy for some role in CMPD and/or sex reversal. The mRNA,
approximately 3.7 kb long, was expressed in testis as demonstrated by
Northern blot analysis. However, they were unable to find any long open
reading frame (ORF) in the 3.5-kb cDNA sequence or to detect any peptide
following an in vitro translation experiment using RNA transcribed from
this cDNA. Consequently, they speculated that the gene may play a
critical role in differentiation or sex determination as a functional
RNA.

Whereas mutations in the ORF of SOX9 cause haploinsufficiency and
campomelic dysplasia, the effects of translocations 5-prime to SOX9 were
unclear and prompted Wunderle et al. (1998) to test whether these
rearrangements also cause haploinsufficiency by altering spatial and
temporal expression of SOX9. For this purpose, they generated mice
transgenic for human SOX9-lacZ YACs containing variable amounts of DNA
sequences upstream of SOX9. They showed that elements necessary for SOX9
expression during skeletal development are highly conserved between
mouse and human and that a rearrangement upstream of SOX9, similar to
those observed in campomelic dysplasia patients, leads to a substantial
reduction of SOX9 expression, particularly in chondrogenic tissues.
Thus, important regulatory elements are scattered over a large region
upstream of SOX9 and explain how particular aspects of the CD phenotype
are caused by chromosomal rearrangements 5-prime to SOX9.

As noted earlier, several campomelic dysplasia translocation and
inversion cases have been described with breakpoints outside the coding
region, mapping to locations more than 130 kb proximal to SOX9. These
cases are generally less severely affected than cases with SOX9 coding
region mutations, as borne out by 3 new translocation cases presented by
Pfeifer et al. (1999). They cloned the region extending 1.2 Mb upstream
of the SOX9 gene in overlapping BAC and PAC clones and established a
restriction map with rare-cutter enzymes. With STS-content mapping in
somatic cell hybrids, as well as with FISH, they mapped precisely the
breakpoints of 3 new and 3 previously described CMPD cases. The 6 CMPD
breakpoints mapped to an interval 140 to 950 kb proximal to the SOX9
gene. With exon trapping, they isolated 5 potential exons from a YAC
that spanned the region, 4 of which could be placed in the contig in the
vicinity of the breakpoints. These potential exons showed the same
transcriptional orientation, but only 2 had an ORF. Pfeifer et al.
(1999) failed to detect expression of these fragments in several human
and mouse cDNA libraries, as well as on Northern blots. Genomic sequence
totaling 1,063 kb from the SOX9 5-prime flanking region was determined
and analyzed, but no genes or transcripts could be identified. Together,
these data suggested that chromosomal rearrangements most likely removed
one or more cis-regulatory elements from the extended SOX9 control
region.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Gordon et al. (2009) reviewed the spectrum of lesions surrounding the
SOX9 gene, noting that translocation breakpoints upstream of SOX9 can be
clustered into 3 groups, with a trend towards less severe skeletal
phenotypes as the distance of each cluster from the SOX9 gene increases.
The authors stated that the identification of novel lesions surrounding
SOX9 supported the existence of tissue-specific enhancers acting over a
long distance to regulate SOX9 expression during craniofacial
development.

- Campomelic Dysplasia with or without Sex Reversal

In 6 of 9 patients with campomelic dysplasia (114290), Foster et al.
(1994) identified mutations in single alleles of the SOX9 gene. The 3
mutations described in detail would be expected to destroy gene
function; 2 caused frameshifts that led to premature chain termination
and loss of one-third of the protein (608160.0002, 608160.0003), and 1
caused a premature termination that truncated the protein at 40% of its
predicted length (608160.0001). Both parents of 2 of the patients did
not have the mutation. The de novo appearance of a mutation in a
sex-reversed campomelic patient established that alterations in SOX9
caused both abnormalities. The findings indicated that SOX9 is involved
in both bone formation and control of testis development. Foster et al.
(1994) suggested that campomelic dysplasia is an autosomal dominant
disorder, as they did not detect mutations in both SOX9 alleles of any
patient. Dominance appeared to be due to haploinsufficiency rather than
gain of function.

Wagner et al. (1994) likewise identified inactivating mutations in 1
SOX9 allele in nontranslocation CMPD-SOX9 cases pointing to
haploinsufficiency for SOX9 as the cause of both campomelic dysplasia
and autosomal XY sex reversal (see 608160.0005). The 17q breakpoints in
3 translocation cases mapped 50 kb or more from SOX9.

Kwok et al. (1995) analyzed the SOX9 gene in 9 patients with campomelic
dysplasia, 2 of whom had chromosome 17 rearrangements, and identified
heterozygosity for 2 missense mutations, 3 frameshift mutations, and a
splice site mutation, respectively, in 6 of the patients with no
cytologically detectable chromosomal aberrations. An identical
frameshift mutation (608160.0013) was found in 2 unrelated 46,XY
patients, 1 exhibiting a male phenotype and the other displaying a
female phenotype (XY sex reversal). Kwok et al. (1995) noted that these
results were consistent with the hypothesis that CMPD results from
haploinsufficiency of SOX9.

Sock et al. (2003) presented 2 CMPD patients with de novo mutations in a
conserved region preceding the HMG domain of SOX9. A long-term survivor
with the acampomelic form of CMPD had an ala76-to-glu amino acid
substitution (608160.0009), while a severely affected CMPD patient had
an in-frame deletion of amino acid residues 66 through 75 (608160.0010).
The conserved domain functions in the related transcription factor SOX10
as a DNA-dependent dimerization domain. The authors demonstrated that
like SOX10, SOX9 binds cooperatively as a dimer to response elements in
regulatory regions of some target genes such as the cartilage genes
COL11A2 (120290) and cartilage-derived retinoic acid-sensitive protein
(MIA/CDRAP; 601340). Dimerization and the resulting capacity to activate
promoters via dimeric binding sites was lost in both mutant SOX9
proteins while other features involved in SOX9 function remained
unaltered. The authors concluded that the dimerization domain is a third
domain essential for SOX9 function during chondrogenesis.

In a 6-year-old 46,XY girl with acampomelic campomelic dysplasia and
complete sex reversal and her mildly affected mother, Lecointre et al.
(2009) identified heterozygosity for a 960-kb deletion upstream of the
SOX9 gene (608160.0015). The authors stated that this deletion narrowed
the minimum critical region and reduced the number of highly conserved
sequence elements responsible for acampomelic campomelic dysplasia.

- Pierre Robin Sequence

Benko et al. (2009) reported several lines of evidence for the existence
of a 17q24 locus underlying isolated Pierre Robin sequence (261800),
including linkage analysis results, a clustering of translocation
breakpoints 1.06 to 1.23 Mb upstream of the SOX9 gene, and
microdeletions that were approximately 1.5 Mb centromeric and 1.5 Mb
telomeric of SOX9. They identified a heterozygous point mutation in an
evolutionarily conserved region of DNA with in vitro and in vivo
features of a developmental enhancer; the mutation abrogated the in
vitro enhancer function and altered binding of the transcription factor
MSX1 (142983) compared to wildtype. In the developing mouse mandible,
the 3-Mb region bounded by the microdeletions showed a regionally
specific chromatin decompaction in cells expressing SOX9. Benko et al.
(2009) concluded that some cases of Pierre Robin sequence may result
from developmental misexpression of SOX9 due to disruption of
very-long-range cis-regulatory elements.

- Cooks Syndrome

In affected members of 4 unrelated families with a phenotype consistent
with Cooks syndrome (106995), Kurth et al. (2009) identified overlapping
duplications in a 2-Mb interval on chromosome 17q24.3, with a minimal
critical area of 1.2 Mb. The region encompassed a large gene desert
between KCNJ2 (600681) and SOX9. The duplications were confirmed by
quantitative PCR and were not detected in more than 400 control DNA
samples. The duplications occurred de novo in 2 families. Kurth et al.
(2009) suggested that the duplications involved putative regulatory
elements of SOX9 and may induce SOX9 misexpression and/or overexpression
at specific time points during development, resulting in abnormal digit
and nail development. In mouse embryo, Sox9 was strongly expressed in
the distal mesenchymal condensations that develop into terminal
phalanges.

- 46,XY Gonadal Dysgenesis

Prompted by the observation that mutations of the SOX9 gene can cause
campomelic dysplasia with 46,XY sex reversal, Kwok et al. (1996)
examined the entire coding region of the SOX9 gene in 30 46,XY patients
with abnormalities of sexual development but without any skeletal
abnormalities. Of the 30 patients, gonadal dysgenesis was diagnosed in
12 and partial gonadal dysgenesis in 14. Except for a C-to-T
polymorphism at nucleotide 507 in 1 person, no other abnormalities of
the SOX9 were found.

- Sex Reversal, 46,XX Male, Autosomal

Cox et al. (2011) identified a family with 46,XX testicular disorder of
sex development (see 278850) in which 3 adult males, 2 brothers and a
paternal uncle, were determined to be female according to karyotype
(46,XX) and were negative for the SRY gene. Cox et al. (2011) identified
a 178-kb duplication 600 kb upstream of SOX9 in the 3 affected
individuals. The duplication was arranged in tandem in wildtype
orientation, and the joining points of the duplicated segments were
uncorrupted. All affected family members carried the duplication in
heterozygosity as did the proband's healthy, fertile 46,XY father.
Affected individuals were infertile with azoospermia. In 2 men the
testes had been removed and prostheses placed during their 20s because
of testicular pain secondary to testosterone replacement. Histologic
exams showed the presence of Leydig and Sertoli cells, severely
diminished and atrophied seminiferous tubules, and no spermatogenesis.

CYTOGENETICS

Velagaleti et al. (2005) presented a balanced translocation,
t(4;17)(q28.3;q24.3), segregating in a family with mild CMPD with Pierre
Robin sequence (602196). They identified both chromosome breakpoints by
FISH and sequenced them using a somatic cell hybrid. They found that the
17q24.3 breakpoint mapped approximately 900 kb upstream of SOX9, which
was within the same BAC clone as the breakpoints of 2 other reported
patients with mild CMPD. They also reported a prenatal identification of
CMPD with male-to-female sex reversal in a fetus with a de novo balanced
complex karyotype. The 17q breakpoint mapped approximately 1.3 Mb
downstream of SOX9, making this the longest-range position effect found
to that time in the field of human genetics and the first report of a
patient with CMPD with the chromosome breakpoint mapping 3-prime of
SOX9. By using the Regulatory Potential score in conjunction with
analysis of the rearrangement breakpoints, they identified a candidate
upstream cis-regulatory element, SOX9cre1 (SOX9 conserved regulatory
element-1). Velagaleti et al. (2005) provided evidence that this 1.1-kb
evolutionarily conserved element and the downstream breakpoint region
colocalize with SOX9 in the interphase nucleus, despite being located
1.1 Mb upstream and 1.3 Mb downstream of it, respectively.

Hill-Harfe et al. (2005) presented fine mapping of chromosome 17
translocation breakpoints upstream of SOX9 associated with skeletal
dysplasias. The breakpoint in this case was the most proximal to the
SOX9 gene identified up to that time. Their family F had been reported
by Stalker and Zori (1997) and Stalker et al. (2005); see Pierre Robin
sequence with pectus excavatum and rib and scapular anomalies (602196).
Pierre Robin sequence, hypoplastic scapulae, and 11 pairs of ribs are
the primary features in family F and are nearly universal in both mild
and severe forms of CMPD. However, Hill-Harfe et al. (2005) considered
this case to represent either an etiologically distinct disorder or a
mild form of CMPD because many other features of CMPD were not present.

Leipoldt et al. (2007) reported a patient with characteristic symptoms
of CMPD and a 46,XY,t(1;17)(q42.1;q24.3) karyotype in whom they mapped
the 17q breakpoint 375 kb upstream from SOX9 using standard and
high-resolution fiber FISH. Another patient with a
46,X,t(Y;17)(q11.2;q24.3) karyotype had the acampomelic form of CMPD and
complete XY sex reversal; using FISH and somatic cell hybrid analysis,
the authors mapped the 17q breakpoint 789 kb from SOX9. Combining their
data with previously published CMPD translocation breakpoints, Leipoldt
et al. (2007) defined 2 clusters upstream of the SOX9 gene: a proximal
cluster of breakpoints between 50 and 375 kb upstream and a distal
cluster of breakpoints between 789 and 932 kb upstream.

EVOLUTION

Patel et al. (2001) examined the molecular evolution of DAX1 (300473),
SRY (480000), and SOX9 genes involved in mammalian sex determination in
6 primate species. DAX1 and SRY were added to the X and Y chromosomes,
respectively, during mammalian evolution, whereas SOX9 remained
autosomal. They determined the genomic sequences of DAX1, SRY, and SOX9
in all 6 species, and calculated K(a), the number of nonsynonymous
substitutions per nonsynonymous site, and compared this with the K(s),
the number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site. Phylogenetic
trees were constructed by means of the DAX1, SRY, and SOX9 coding
sequences, and phylogenetic analysis was performed using maximum
likelihood. Overall measures of gene and protein similarity were closer
for DAX1 and SOX9, but DAX1 exhibited nonsynonymous amino acid
substitutions at an accelerated frequency relative to synonymous
changes, similar to SRY and significantly higher than SOX9. Patel et al.
(2001) concluded that, at the protein level, DAX1 and SRY are under less
selective pressure to remain conserved than SOX9, and, therefore,
diverge more across species than does SOX9. These results were
consistent with evolutionary stratification of the mammalian sex
determination pathway, analogous to that for sex chromosomes which may
be evolving by punctuated sequential events (Lahn and Page, 1997, 1999).

Sex determination in many reptiles, including the American alligator, is
determined by temperature rather than by sex chromosomes as is the case
in mammals and birds. Using incubation temperatures favorable to male or
female development, Western et al. (1999) showed that Sox9 expression in
alligator embryos was male- and testis- specific, occurred near the end
of the 10-day temperature-sensitive period, and was coincident with
structural organization of the testis. The late timing of Sox9
expression suggests that Sox9 is unlikely to directly induce the
differentiation of the supporting cell lineage into mature Sertoli cells
in alligators.

ANIMAL MODEL

Studying the expression of mouse Sox9 during embryogenesis, Wright et
al. (1995) found that the gene is expressed predominantly in mesenchymal
condensations throughout the embryo before and during the deposition of
cartilage, consistent with a primary role in skeletal formation. The
expression pattern and chromosomal location of Sox9 suggested that it
may be the gene defective in the mouse skeletal mutant 'Tail-short,' a
potential animal model for campomelic dysplasia.

To analyze Sox9 function during sex determination in mice, Vidal et al.
(2001) ectopically expressed this gene in XX gonads. They showed that
Sox9 is sufficient to induce testis formation in mice, indicating that
it can substitute for the sex-determining gene Sry.

Akiyama et al. (2002) conditionally deleted the Sox9 gene in mice to
examine its contribution at different steps in chondrocyte
differentiation. Inactivation of Sox9 in limb buds before mesenchymal
condensations resulted in complete absence of cartilage and bone and
loss of Sox5 (604975), Sox6 (607257), and Runx2 (600211) expression.
Markers for the different axes of limb development were unaffected.
Apoptotic domains within the developing limbs were expanded, suggesting
that Sox9 suppresses apoptosis. Deletion of Sox9 expression after
mesenchymal condensations resulted in a severe generalized
chondrodysplasia. Most cells arrested as condensed mesenchymal cells and
did not undergo overt differentiation into chondrocytes. Chondrocyte
proliferation was inhibited, expression of genes associated with
chondrocyte proliferation was downregulated, and joint formation was
defective. Akiyama et al. (2002) concluded that SOX9 is needed to
prevent conversion of proliferating chondrocytes into hypertrophic
chondrocytes and that SOX9 is required during sequential steps of the
chondrocyte differentiation pathway.

SOX9 has essential roles in endochondral bone formation during axial and
appendicular skeletogenesis. Because SOX9 is also expressed in neural
crest cells, Mori-Akiyama et al. (2003) studied its function in neural
crest. As many craniofacial skeletal elements are derived from cranial
neural crest cells, the authors hypothesized that deletion of Sox9 in
cranial neural crest cells of mice using the Cre recombinase/loxP
recombination system would affect craniofacial development. They found
that inactivation of Sox9 in neural crest resulted in a complete absence
of cartilages and endochondral bones derived from the cranial neural
crest. In contrast, all of the mesodermal skeletal elements and
intramembranous bones were essentially conserved. Migration and
localization of the Sox9 null mutant cranial neural crest cells were
normal. In mouse embryo chimeras, Sox9 null mutant cells migrated to
their correct location in endochondral skeletal elements; however, the
deficient cranial neural crest cells were unable to contribute
chondrogenic mesenchymal condensations. Mori-Akiyama et al. (2003)
suggested that these cells changed their cell fate and acquired the
ability to differentiate into osteoblasts.

Stolt et al. (2003) ablated Sox9 from mouse neural stem cells to study
its role in the switch from neurogenesis to gliogenesis during spinal
cord development. Mutant mice exhibited an early and dramatic reduction
in progenitors of the myelin-forming oligodendrocytes, but
oligodendrocyte progenitor numbers recovered at later stages of
development. Astrocyte numbers were severely reduced and did not recover
at later stages. Stolt et al. (2003) concluded that SOX9 is a major
molecular component of the neuron-glia switch in developing spinal cord.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CAMPOMELIC DYSPLASIA
SOX9, 583C-T

In a 46,XX female with typical features of campomelic dysplasia
(114290), Foster et al. (1994) found a 583C-T transition in the SOX9
gene, resulting in a premature stop codon at amino acid position 195
(195X) of the predicted 509-amino acid sequence. The mutation was not
found in either parent and was also absent in DNA samples from over 100
unaffected individuals.

.0002
CAMPOMELIC DYSPLASIA WITH AUTOSOMAL SEX REVERSAL
SOX9, 1-BP INS, 783G

In a 46,XY female with typical features of campomelic dysplasia (see
114290), Foster et al. (1994) identified a single G insertion in a
series of 6 Gs (nucleotides 783-788) contained within codons 261-263 of
SOX9. The resulting frameshift introduced a premature stop codon such
that a 294-amino acid truncated protein would be translated.

.0003
CAMPOMELIC DYSPLASIA WITH AUTOSOMAL SEX REVERSAL
SOX9, 4-BP INS

In a 46,XY female fetus aborted at 17 weeks because of ultrasound
findings of short limbs and cystic hygroma and with clinical findings
consistent with campomelic dysplasia (see 114290), including 7 pairs of
ribs, Foster et al. (1994) found a 4-bp insertion following amino acid
286 (nucleotide 858) of the predicted protein sequence. The frameshift
introduced a premature stop with a predicted translation of a 294-amino
acid truncated protein as in the patient described in 608160.0002.

.0004
CAMPOMELIC DYSPLASIA
CAMPOMELIC DYSPLASIA WITH AUTOSOMAL SEX REVERSAL, INCLUDED
SOX9, 1-BP INS, 1096C

Cameron et al. (1996) reported a family in which there were 3 patients
affected with campomelic dysplasia (114290). Two of the patients showed
46,XY sex reversal (see 114290). The gonadal phenotype varied widely
among the 3 affected sibs. The proband had 46,XY true hermaphroditism
with ambiguous external genitalia. The other 2 sibs were 46,XY and 46,XX
and both had bilateral ovaries with normal female genitalia. A 1-bp
insertion (cytidine) at nucleotide position 1096 was detected in the
affected children. Mutational analysis revealed wildtype SOX9 nucleotide
sequence in the parental somatic cells but detected gonadal mosaicism
for the mutation in the father's germ cells. Cameron et al. (1996) noted
that incomplete penetrance or stochastic environmental factors could
account for the variable phenotype.

.0005
CAMPOMELIC DYSPLASIA WITH AUTOSOMAL SEX REVERSAL
SOX9, TYR440TER

Wagner et al. (1994) reported a de novo nonsense mutation within codon
440 (Y440X; TAC-TAG) in a sex-reversed XY female with campomelic
dysplasia (see 114290) who survived for 4 years (Ebensperger et al.,
1991). Meyer et al. (1997) identified the same de novo stop codon
mutation in a karyotypic and phenotypic female who was still alive at
the age of 10 years.

In a female infant with campomelic dysplasia and XY sex reversal, Pop et
al. (2005) identified homozygosity for the Y440X mutation. Neither
parent carried the mutation; analysis of intragenic SNPs suggested that
the homozygous mutation arose by a mitotic gene conversion event
involving exchange of at least 440 nucleotides and at most 2,208
nucleotides between a de novo mutant maternal allele and a wildtype
paternal allele. The patient also had somatic mosaicism, with homozygous
mutant cells constituting about 80% of the leukocyte cell population,
whereas about 20% were heterozygous mutant cells; she died at the age of
3 months due to progressive respiratory compromise. Transient
cotransfection experiments in mouse neuro2a cells demonstrated that the
Y440X mutant retained some transactivation capacity on authentic
SOX9-responsive promoters/enhancers, ranging from 5 to 22% of wildtype
activity. Pop et al. (2005) suggested that this is a hypomorphic rather
than a complete loss-of-function allele, which may account for the
milder phenotype and longer survival seen in some patients with this
mutation.

.0006
ACAMPOMELIC CAMPOMELIC DYSPLASIA
SOX9, LYS173GLU

Acampomelic campomelic dysplasia (see 114290) is a rare variant of the
more commonly encountered campomelic dysplasia, characterized by absence
of long bone curvature. Thong et al. (2000) described a patient with
acampomelic dysplasia with a de novo heterozygous mutation in the SOX9
gene, resulting in a lys173-to-glu (K173E) substitution. The mutation
was located within the DNA binding HMG (high mobility group) domain of
the SOX9 protein. The mutation was not present in the parents. The
patient's antenatal period was uneventful, apart from renal pelvis
dilatation detected at 19 weeks on ultrasound scan. Soon after birth he
developed severe respiratory distress requiring ventilation for 2 weeks
and continuous positive airway pressure via nasal prong thereafter. He
developed recurrent chest infections and feeding difficulties. Oxygen
supplementation was discontinued at 7 months. Physical examination
showed rounded face, flat nasal bridge, micrognathia, midline cleft
palate, long deep philtrum, and small mouth. The genital abnormalities
consisted of bifid scrotum, perineal hypospadias, and undescended right
testis. He had deep plantar creases, mild clinodactyly, small and
hyperconvex nails, and limited elbow extension. The limbs were straight
with no pretibial dimples. The karyotype was 46,XY. Skeletal survey at 7
weeks showed 11 pairs of gracile ribs, hypoplastic scapulas, dysplastic
clavicles with broad medial aspects, and coronal clefts in the vertebral
bodies T11, L1, and L2. The bodies of the iliac and pubic bones were
hypoplastic with small sacrosciatic notches. The long bones were
straight with mild shortness and flare of the metaphyses.

.0007
CAMPOMELIC DYSPLASIA WITH AUTOSOMAL SEX REVERSAL
SOX9, 1-BP DEL, 296G

In a patient with campomelic syndrome with autosomal sex reversal (see
114290), Ninomiya et al. (2000) identified a 1-bp deletion (296G),
resulting in a frameshift upstream of the HMG box and a stop codon in
the HMG domain of SOX9. The predicted truncated SOX9 protein contained
108 amino acids instead of the normal 509. Despite the marked change in
the SOX9 protein, the patient had survived for 63 months, although
requiring daily mechanical support of ventilation.

.0008
ACAMPOMELIC CAMPOMELIC DYSPLASIA
SOX9, HIS165TYR

In a chromosomally normal boy with acampomelic campomelic dysplasia (see
114290), Moog et al. (2001) identified a heterozygous 865C-T transition
in the SOX9 gene, leading to a his165-to-tyr (H165Y) substitution.

.0009
ACAMPOMELIC CAMPOMELIC DYSPLASIA
SOX9, ALA76GLU

In a long-term survivor with acampomelic campomelic dysplasia (see
114290), Sock et al. (2003) reported a C-to-A transversion in the SOX9
gene that resulted in an ala76-to-glu (A76E) amino acid substitution.
Dimerization and the resulting capacity to activate promoters via
dimeric binding sites was lost in the mutant SOX9 protein while other
features involved in SOX9 function remained unaltered.

.0010
CAMPOMELIC DYSPLASIA
SOX9, 30-BP DEL

In a patient with campomelic dysplasia (114290), Sock et al. (2003)
detected a 30-bp deletion in the SOX9 gene that removed amino acids 66
through 75 (delta66-75). The 30-bp deletion occurred between 2
hexanucleotide repeats, retaining 1 copy. The patient, a girl who died
soon after birth from respiratory failure, had all the hallmarks of
campomelic dysplasia, including bending of femora, tibiae, and fibulae.
Additionally she showed the rare findings of absence of toenails and a
broad gap between the first and second toes, combined with syndactyly
between the second, third, and fourth toes.

.0011
CAMPOMELIC DYSPLASIA
SOX9, PHE154LEU

In an infant with campomelic dysplasia (114290), Preiss et al. (2001)
identified a heterozygous 462C-G transversion in the SOX9 gene,
resulting in a phe154-to-leu (F154L) substitution. F154 is a highly
conserved residue of helix 3 within the HMG domain. Fluorescence studies
showed that the mutant F154L protein did not have significant changes in
tertiary structure. In vitro functional expression studies demonstrated
that the mutant protein had a significant loss of DNA-binding activity
(5% of wildtype) and a loss of transcriptional activation activity (26%
of wildtype).

.0012
CAMPOMELIC DYSPLASIA WITH AUTOSOMAL SEX REVERSAL
SOX9, ALA158THR

In a patient with campomelic dysplasia with autosomal sex reversal (see
114290), Preiss et al. (2001) identified a heterozygous 472G-A
transition in the SOX9 gene, resulting in an ala158-to-thr (A158T)
substitution. A158 is a highly conserved residue of helix 3 within the
HMG domain. Fluorescence studies showed that the mutant A158T protein
did not have significant changes in tertiary structure. In vitro
functional expression studies demonstrated that the mutant protein had a
2-fold decrease in nuclear accumulation, a loss of DNA-binding activity
(17% of wildtype), and a milder loss of transcriptional activation
activity (62% of wildtype).

CAMPOMELIC DYSPLASIA
CAMPOMELIC DYSPLASIA WITH AUTOSOMAL SEX REVERSAL, INCLUDED
SOX9, 1-BP INS, 1103A

In a 46,XY patient with campomelic dysplasia (114290) and a 46,XY
patient with campomelic dysplasia and autosomal sex reversal (see
114290), Kwok et al. (1995) identified heterozygosity for a 1-bp
insertion (1103insA) in the SOX9 gene, causing a frameshift at codon 368
and resulting in an early termination signal at nucleotide 1671. The
authors attributed the difference in sexual phenotype of these two 46,XY
individuals to incomplete penetrance of the disease that might result
from differences in genetic background.

46,XX SEX REVERSAL 2
SOX9, 178-KB DUP, UPSTREAM REGULATORY REGION

Cox et al. (2011) identified a family with 46,XX testicular disorder of
sex development (278850) in which 3 adult males, 2 brothers and a
paternal uncle, were determined to be female according to karyotype and
were negative for the SRY gene (480000). The proband and his uncle had
an approximately 178-kb duplication 600 kb upstream of SOX9. The
duplication was arranged in tandem in wildtype orientation, and the
joining points of the duplicated segments were uncorrupted. All affected
family members carried the duplication as did the proband's healthy,
fertile 46,XY father. Of note, the 1.9-Mb region of chromosome 17
upstream of SOX9 contains no other genes and is evolutionarily highly
conserved in mammals.

ACAMPOMELIC CAMPOMELIC DYSPLASIA WITH AUTOSOMAL SEX REVERSAL
SOX9, 960-KB DEL, UPSTREAM REGULATORY REGION

In a 6-year-old 46,XY girl with acampomelic campomelic dysplasia and
complete sex reversal (see 114290), Lecointre et al. (2009) identified a
heterozygous 960-kb deletion on chromosome 17q24, extending from -517 to
-1.477 kb upstream of SOX9. The deletion was also present in her mildly
affected mother, who was born with cleft palate and had mild
microretrognathia, sandal gap, short great toes, and defective
ischiopubic ossification; the unaffected father's DNA was normal. FISH
analysis confirmed the presence of the deletion in the mother and
daughter and its absence in the father; analysis of interphase nuclei in
3 different tissues from the mother demonstrated the presence of the
deletion in 97 to 98.5% of nuclei, which suggested that the mother did
not have somatic mosaicism. MLPA results were consistent with the
interphase FISH analysis, again strongly suggesting that the mother was
not mosaic for the deletion. Lecointre et al. (2009) stated that this
deletion narrowed the minimum critical region and reduced the number of
highly conserved sequence elements responsible for acampomelic
campomelic dysplasia.

612910	TITLE *612910 PHD FINGER PROTEIN 23; PHF23
PHF23/NUP98 FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching for genes in a region of chromosome 17 involved in a
translocation associated with acute myeloid leukemia (AML; 601626),
followed by 5-prime and 3-prime RACE, Reader et al. (2007) cloned 2
splice variants of PHF23 that differed in their 3-prime noncoding
regions. The deduced 403-amino acid protein contains a C-terminal
coiled-coiled domain and a plant homeodomain (PHD) finger. The PHD
finger is a structural fold found in nuclear proteins that is
coordinated by 2 zinc atoms and is predicted to mediate chromatin
remodeling.

MAPPING

Using FISH and genomic sequence analysis, Reader et al. (2007) mapped
the PHF23 gene to chromosome 17p13.

CYTOGENETICS

- PHF23/NUP98 Fusion Gene

In a 42-year-old man with AML, Reader et al. (2007) identified a cryptic
translocation, t(11;17)(p15;p13), that resulted in in-frame fusion of
exon 13 of NUP98 (601021) to exon 4 of PHF23. The deduced chimeric
protein contains the N-terminal half of NUP98 fused to the C-terminal
functional domains of PHF23.

;;RIBONUCLEASE P/MRP SUBUNIT, 29-KD SUBUNIT; RPP29;;
RIBONUCLEASE P, 29-KD SUBUNIT
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Ribonuclease P (RNase P) removes the 5-prime leader sequences from
precursor tRNA molecules. RNase P consists of an RNA species (H1 RNA),
the POP1 protein (602486), and at least 7 proteins called RPPs. The RPPs
have apparent molecular masses of 14 kD (RPP14; 606112), 20 kD (RPP20;
606113), 25 kD (RPP25), 29 kD (RPP29), 30 kD (RPP30; 606115), 38 kD
(RPP38; 606116), and 40 kD (RPP40; 606117). Patients with scleroderma
(181750) have serum reactive with RNase P, the Th antigen, which is also
referred to as the To antigen, and RPP30 and RPP38 (summary by Jarrous
et al., 1998, 1999).

CLONING

By biochemical purification of RNase P, micropeptide sequence analysis,
and EST database searching, Jarrous et al. (1999) obtained a cDNA
encoding RPP29. The deduced 220-amino acid basic protein is rich in
arginine and lysine, has nuclear localization sequences, and has a
predicted molecular mass of approximately 25 kD. RPP29 is 23% identical
to the yeast Pop4 protein. Fluorescent microscopy demonstrated nuclear
and nucleolar expression of RPP29. Immunoblot analysis showed that
antibodies to RPP14 or RPP29 precipitate native RNase P.

Van Eenennaam et al. (1999) cloned human and mouse RPP29, which they
termed POP4. In addition to RNase P, immunoprecipitation analysis
indicated that RPP29 is associated with RNase MRP (see 157660).

MAPPING

Gross (2013) mapped the POP4 gene to chromosome 19q12 based on an
alignment of the POP4 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF001176) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

614533	TITLE *614533 CELL DIVISION CYCLE 26, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; CDC26
;;ANAPHASE-PROMOTING COMPLEX, SUBUNIT 12; ANAPC12; APC12
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CDC26 is a subunit of the anaphase-promoting complex (APC), or
cyclosome. APC is a cell cycle-regulated ubiquitin-protein ligase that
regulates important events in mitosis, such as initiation of anaphase
and exit from telophase (Gmachl et al., 2000).

CLONING

By mass spectrometric analysis of peptides that immunopurified with HeLa
cell APC, followed by database analysis, Gmachl et al. (2000) identified
CDC26. The deduced 84-amino acid protein had an apparent molecular mass
of 14 kD by SDS-PAGE. Western blot analysis detected crossreacting
proteins in APCs isolated from mouse cells, cow brain, and Xenopus eggs,
suggesting a high degree of conservation.

GENE FUNCTION

Zachariae et al. (1996) found that yeast Cdc26 was induced and was
essential for APC activity when the growth temperature was raised from
25 degrees C to 35 or 37 degrees C.

MAPPING

Hartz (2012) mapped the CDC26 gene to chromosome 9q32 based on an
alignment of the CDC26 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF503918) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37). An identical sequence, possibly a pseudogene,
maps to chromosome 7q32.1.

602650	TITLE *602650 SPECKLE-TYPE POZ PROTEIN; SPOP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Nagai et al. (1997) observed that COS-7 cells immunostained with
antiserum from a scleroderma patient showed a rough speckled pattern in
nuclei. As the antiserum did not react with known spliceoform antigens,
the authors immunoscreened a human HeLa cell cDNA library to identify
the antigen. Using expression cloning, Nagai et al. (1997) isolated a
novel cDNA, designated SPOP. The SPOP gene encodes a 374-amino acid
polypeptide that contains a poxvirus and zinc finger (POZ) domain and an
evolutionarily conserved N-terminal region. The protein colocalized with
the splicing factor SNRPB (182282). Removal of either domain abolished
the intranuclear speckled localization of the protein.

By searching for sequences containing TRAF-like domains (see TRAF1,
601711), followed by RT-PCR of Jurkat human T-cell total RNA, Zapata et
al. (2001) cloned SPOP. The deduced protein contains an N-terminal
TRAF-like domain and a C-terminal POZ domain.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the SPOP
gene to chromosome 17 (TMAP RH102186).

GENE FUNCTION

Zapata et al. (2001) found that the TRAF-like domain of SPOP interacted
in vitro with TRAF1 and TRAF6 (602355), but not with other TRAF proteins
tested.

Liu et al. (2009) identified an ortholog of the human SPOP gene as a
component in the Drosophila segmentation pathway. Spop interacted with
segmental transcription factors Evx1 (142996), Evx2 (142991), and Ftz
(184757), and mediated degeneration of the Drosophila JNK phosphatase
Puckered. Overexpression of SPOP in HEK293 cells resulted in increased
amounts of phosphorylated JNK. Microarray analysis detected high
expression of SPOP was found in up to 99% of human renal cell carcinomas
(RCC; 144700), but not in normal kidney tissue. Liu et al. (2009)
suggested that SPOP may be a specific tumor marker for renal cell
carcinoma.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Le Gallo et al. (2012) used whole-exome sequencing to comprehensively
search for somatic mutations in 13 primary serous endometrial tumors
(see 608089), and subsequently resequenced 18 genes that were mutated in
more than 1 tumor and/or were components of an enriched functional
grouping from 40 additional serous tumors. Le Gallo et al. (2012)
identified a high frequency of somatic mutation (8%) in the SPOP gene.

191050	TITLE *191050 TRYPTOPHANYL-tRNA SYNTHETASE; WARS
;;TRYPTOPHANYL-tRNA SYNTHETASE, CYTOPLASMIC
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases catalyze the first step of protein synthesis.
Human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (YARS; 603623) can be split into 2
fragments having distinct cytokine activities, thereby linking protein
synthesis to cytokine signaling pathways. Tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase
(WARS) is a close homolog of tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase. It catalyzes the
aminoacylation of tRNA(trp) with tryptophan, an essential function of
the cell's protein synthesis machinery.

CLONING

Frolova et al. (1991) cloned the human gene and reported its nucleotide
sequence. Shimizu et al. (1976) and Denney et al. (1978) located the
structural gene for tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase on chromosome 14.

GENE FUNCTION

In normal cells, human tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase exists in 2 forms.
The major form is the full-length protein, and the other is a truncated
form in which most of the extra-NH2-terminal domain is deleted because
of alternative splicing of the pre-mRNA (Tolstrup et al., 1995; Turpaev
et al., 1996), with met48 being deduced as the NH2-terminal residue of
the truncated form. The expression of the short form of WARS is highly
stimulated in human cells by the addition of interferon-gamma (IFNG;
147570).

Wakasugi et al. (2002) showed that the truncated form of WARS is
angiostatic in several different systems and assays, whereas the
full-length enzyme is inactive. Thus, protein synthesis may be linked to
the regulation of angiogenesis by a natural fragment of
tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase.

Otani et al. (2002) showed that a recombinant form of a COOH-terminal
fragment of tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase is a potent antagonist of
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF; 192240)-induced angiogenesis
in a mouse model and of naturally occurring retinal angiogenesis in the
neonatal mouse. Angiostatic activity was dose-dependent in both systems.
The full-length protein was inactive as an antagonist of angiogenesis.
The results suggested that fragments of tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase, as
naturally occurring and potentially nonimmunogenic anti-angiogenics, can
be used for the treatment of neovascular eye diseases.

MAPPING

Francke et al. (1977) assigned WARS to 14q21-qter. Graphodatsky et al.
(1993) confirmed the assignment to chromosome 14 and regionalized it by
isotopic in situ hybridization to 14q23-q31. The gene may be in the
14q24 band where one-third of the grains were localized.

Borglum et al. (1996) mapped a cDNA probe of the WARS gene by a
combination of somatic cell hybrid analysis, fluorescence in situ
hybridization (FISH), and linkage analysis. Both FISH and linkage
analysis independently supported a more distal position of WARS than had
been previously reported. FISH mapping indicated the most likely
position to be 14q32.31.

Jensen et al. (2001) found that a pseudogene of the NDUFB3 gene
(603839), designated NDUFB3P4, is positioned in intron 2 of the WARS
gene in the opposite direction.
